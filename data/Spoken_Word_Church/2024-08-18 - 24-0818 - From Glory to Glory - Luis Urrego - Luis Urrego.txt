lesson into your hands father help us to receive something from you and Lord just let me get out of the way so that you could use my lips to say father God something to the people that would encourage them Lord and know you more in a personal level forgive us for our sins this morning we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen amen once again we say greetings to all our visitors God bless you and appreciate you being here with us all right I want to talk about this morning about from glory to glory and um uh we'll just read here in Exodus um here's the there's a problem we got ads all right and and it's uh you know what I'm just going to zoom in here I can can you zoom in here I guess not all right Exodus 34: 27-29 and the Lord said unto Moses write down uh write these words for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with with thee and with Israel and he was there with the Lord 40 days and 40 nights and he did neither eat bread nor drink water and he wrote upon the tables of the words uh of the Covenant The Ten Commandments and it came to pass when Moses came down from Mount Si with the two tables of testimony in moses' hand when he came down from the mount that Moses wi not that the the skin of his face Shone while he talked with him so this is what I want to uh I want to concentrate on that Moses's um as Moses was in the in the in the mountain of with with the Lord receiving the word of God or the Commandments the glory was so strong that Moses came down with his face shining before the uh and and he did not know that his face was shining that's how much uh he was in the presence of God and and so we could say that he was in The Presence of Jehovah right amen Mo and there's a there's an image right there of of Moses uh face coming down and that is that is like like you and I Saints you know when we are in The Presence of Jehovah when we are truly receiving from the word of God Amen the world may not have known what has happened to us they just see what's happening on the outside amen that we have had an experience with God and that God God is working in in our in our lives amen and so this was what was happening with Moses as Moses was receiving the word not for just for himself but for the people amen and he was he was man God's chosen man for for that hour and um in verse 30 it says and when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses behold the skin of his face Shone and and they were afraid to come nigh to him amen and we know that the world Amen they're they're only comfortable with their own they're not comfortable that's why they're they get uncomfortable around you and and I because we have a a a a different a different perspective of of things we have we we live differently we we are a condemnation into their lives amen uh if a worldly person likes to be around you uh then you must be acting probably like them uh that's how the only way that they feel comfortable around you is that you partake of the things that they do or that you speak the speech that they that they give but Moses when he came down from the mountain you could tell that he had been with God Amen and the people amen knew that that there was something different about Moses something something was was was different and in so much and that he had to uh he had to Veil his face because the glory was so strong upon on his face that he had to Veil his face in 2 Corinthians it tells us that the light uh um in 2 Corinthians 4:3 it says but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them amen what of the time amen I remember when I when I became became a a Christian and when I was truly wanting to serve the Lord back when I was in high school just finished 12th grade and I said you know what this life that that I'm living I just want to give it up and I got to Ser I want to serve the Lord you know and I just felt that whole tug all throughout high school but I never I never wanted to listen to it just because I wanted to hang out with the with the popular crowd and do what they wanted wanted to do and finally I I said Lord I I can't live this way anymore and I've I've told the the the the the testimony here uh when you are truly living for God Amen you don't have to leave your friends your friends will automatically leave you your so-called friends you know they will automatically uh uh uh take different routes because why they they can't stand to be around where where where where where the word is working amen and so the children of Israel amen where the word was working with Moses they couldn't they couldn't take it they it was too strong they had not been in that presence like Moses had amen and I believe that Moses in this in in this scripture is almost like the type of the believer in in in this our day amen a Believer with Revelation is too strong and is too rich for the world they can't handle it they can't accept it it's it's just too strong and and sometimes when you even talk to nominal people and and you bring forth certain things that we believe in this message amen it's it's in the word right we don't believe the message unless it was in the word but even when you bring it out to them in certain angles they've never seen it that way or they can't accept it that way because it's just too rich for them not that they hate God and not that they hate uh uh uh the the word amen but but that it's too rich for them in other words it's too bright for them amen and that's the work that God has done in in in in you and in our lives amen and we appreciate that and Moses called unto them and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him and Moses talked with them and afterward all the children of Israel came nigh and he gave them Commandments I guess I should be scrolling this too and he gave them commandment in commandment all that the Lord had spoken with him in Mount Si until Moses until Moses had done speaking with them he put a veil on his face so he had that Veil on his face while he was speaking to the children of Israel giving them the word that he had received from but when he would leave their presence and get back in the presence of God that Veil would come right off Amen in other words it was face to face with God Amen it was it was it was a it was a an experience with God nothing to hide nothing to hide you can't hide anything when you're in the presence of God that's right amen when you're truly in the presence of God Amen there's nothing that hi God God God knows your heart God God knows exactly what's going on in your life praise the Lord amen amen now brother brandham says here in the message the unveiling of God he he says something PEC here he says that Moses became the word Moses had the word now remember after the word was made manifest Moses was Moses again see but while that word was in him to be give out he was God and the Bible says said that that he would be God to uh to Aaron and Aaron would be uh see yeah he would be God to Aaron and Aaron would be the prophet to to to the people for he wasn't Moses no more he had the word of the Lord for that age nothing could touch him till that was over had that word with him so therefore when he come the people turned their heads they couldn't understand he had been changed he was a different fellow he come with that word and he put a veil the Bible said over his face for he had the word word and he was the word to them amen so that is what we are to the to the people we are the word amen we are the word of God whom the word of the Lord has come to you are the word you're the living walking breathing word in this hour it's the only Jesus that that this world is going to see amen is you and I amen if Christ is is is really in us but when Moses went in before the Lord to speak with him he took the the veil off until he came out and he came out and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded now in that presence of the Lord amen Moses could be free praise God he was a free man you know and and and we think about um amen the the the high priest amen when he would go behind the veil Amen in the holy of holies praise God he could be free in there amen there was there was no condemnation if he had done everything exactly according to the word of God there is no condemnation to those that are in Christ Jesus amen that's why when condemnation strikes your life and you're wondering well why am I receiving this condemnation why am I being condemned why do I feel condemned when I have not done anything I do not need to make anything right with anybody amen you can bet amen that's nothing but Satan trying to hinder your life trying to stop you from continuing your walk with God Amen but when you are in that presence of God Amen when you are behind the veil amen of that holy of holies Mo uh the the high priest Aaron amen he could partake freely partake of the Mana that was in there of the word amen he could go back and look at the tablets the word amen word on top of word amen and could see Miracles even in that presence because Aaron's broad was in there a dry old stick amen was budding in that presence amen and that stick was not even attached to a tree yet it was budding and giving off almonds but as I always said he it was attached to a tree cuz the tree of life was back in there amen so so so so he was free to partake of anything amen we are free amen if the word of God is in us we are free to partake of any of the blessings any of the promises of God the problem is is that some sometimes we are afraid because we have that Tunis mentality God is up there and I'm down here and it's not that way we are in him and him in US amen we are one unit the bride amen and the bridegroom are one unit amen we are heirs and Joint heirs and the joint air gets exactly what the what the heir gets praise God right amen my wife gets exactly what what what I get because we are married amen nothing the the the dining room table is not is not mine and and and she gets just something else amen and everything in in the house is is mine and and hers amen and she could partake freely of everything in that home amen and that's what God wants us to do right but but but but you know we have to we have to keep in mind that that that God wants us to think of him that way not him up there and us down here we're like like as if we're separate units like like the way most American couples live today supposed to be married your finances over there my finances here this over here this over here no it's supposed to be joined amen it's supposed to be all together right right there's no unity in that there's just opportunities to hide things from one another is what that is amen so second Corinthians 3:16 tells us um nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty amen I'm sorry I I you can't see that I thought that maybe we could zoom this in but all right so when you are sealed in Christ and Christ is sealed in you there is Liberty amen praise the Lord Jesus and the children and the children of Israel saw the face of Moses that the skin of Moses face Shone and Moses put the veil upon his face again until he went in to speak with him amen the glory on moses' face would wear off whenever he was not in the presence of God Amen that Mo that that glory amen that that that that Glory that he would receive he'd come down he'd come down shining because he had just been in the presence but eventually That Glory would fade we would fade off and he'd have to go back and speak to God for in order for that glory amen to come back amen and and in 2 Corinthians 3:7 which we're about to read here in just a moment that it says which Glory was to be done away amen which Glory was to be done away now we can look here real quickly in Mount at Mount Transfiguration Jesus came and invited James John and uh uh Peter there at the at the mount and um they all it's interesting that they all have part of the word amen they have books written in the Bible uh uh uh in the word amen so that's kind of interesting but here comes Jesus doing the same thing that Moses was was was doing but with Moses it was just the face amen with Jesus it was the whole his whole his whole Glory face and and the rest of his body amen and and so showing us amen that here comes a new ministration amen this new ministration coming in which you are part of that body amen you and I were in him amen you and I are the body of Christ amen praise the Lord he is the head so not just his head shining now because as we read here he says and after six days Jesus taketh Peter James and John his brother and bringeth them up in into an high mountain ofart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his reignment was white as the light that's that's some that's some bright bright lights amen when you're shining as bright as the sun and uh so here's here's this image of of of Moses and Elijah right there with Jesus and Peter and James and John right there afraid not ex not want not you know what what would you do if you were in that situation amen praise God and behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him then answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord is good for us to be let's skip down to verse 5 while he yet spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadow D and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him amen so now the administration goes from the law amen it comes to Jesus Christ amen who is the full word amen man in this hour who is the the who is Grace praise the Lord you realize that God from the beginning is what he wanted to display was Grace to the people of God to the children of Israel but because they wanted law he gave them what they what what they wanted and and God Amen he is whatever you want amen that's what he'll give you he's he's he's a gentleman and he's not going to force you Amen to live closer to God have your walk closer to him or or or or or or not amen it it's your choice if you want to grow in Him Praise the Lord amen I believe a true Christian does want to grow in Christ amen I believe a Christian does want to grow in the stature of a perfect man and not not not be stale and not wondering what's going on Amen not not thinking well cuz I go to to a message church that that that's all I need no you you you will find a way amen how can I grow in the Statue of a perfect man amen and part of growing in the Statue of a perfect man is through trials and tribulations I wholeheartedly believe that that's part of the Christian Journey you must suffer as I said last time amen So when you say you're a Christian amen you just get ready to suffer suffer suffer away because that's what's going to mold your character that's what's going to mold you into this into this image as the word as you're feeding and eating the word amen you're also suffering uing amen for him praise the Lord Jesus because the more is given to you the more you're responsible for you remember that think about that the more word and the more Revelation that is given to you the more is going to be asked of you so the more challenge will and more trials will come to you as you're feeding it's not about just let me get all this head knowledge and me not suffer anything in life no doesn't work that way Amen Let Me obtain this knowledge amen that I may apply it in my life and Lord I will suffer for you in order to see that knowledge that I have obtained that word that I have obtained to display now I can display patience when patience is needed now I can I can display amen mercy and Grace to someone when mercy and Grace is needed amen because it's in you and it was molded in you praise God Amen so just as Moses was the man man of the hour for his day um Jesus was the man of the hour not just them but for all of the ages to come through his people amen praise God and I like what that after the the disciples amen when they when Jesus went away amen they didn't see any other man there but only Jesus amen there at the mount Transfiguration praise God now in 2 Corinthians and uh you go back and read 2 Corinthians chap 3 we're not going to have time to read it uh but read 2 Corinthians chapter 3 because Paul in that chapter talks about exactly what had happened there in on Mount on the mountain with Moses and his face shineing and and he and he and he brings it down to the point of that you and I are now that word is not in two tablets anymore but now that word is written in the tablets of our heart praise God and that we are now written Epistles read of all men praise God so what is what is what is what what is the world reading what are the people reading they're reading your life amen they're not they don't have to read tablets of stone anymore just as Moses had to come down praise God but now they are reading your life amen and and as I said you know the people who don't understand just like the children of Israel they didn't understand what Moses had been through amen so because Moses became the word to them as he as he came down to them to give them the word still to this day the true Jews amen because there are those fake Jews out there but they true Jews amen who really amen are seeking God Amen that they don't understand this word that Veil Paul talks about that Veil still over their face right amen because why they are veiled to the word and what was Moses to them when he came down from the mountain as brother Brown said he was the word to them so that word is still veiled to them praise God and so and so Paul Paul talks about that that if the ministration of death written and engraven in Stones was glorious in other words if that was glorious and that had Glory attached to it bright lights and everything how much more the ministration of life amen praise God the ministration of Grace in this hour amen how shall the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious as Paul says it's even more glorious amen the grace that you and I can partake of in this hour for if the ministration of condemnation because that's what the law did it would just condemn you it would send you to jail hey if you didn't do exactly amen then there was punishment amen and it's the same today amen but there's Grace attached to it praise God there is a there is Grace amen that only Jesus could provide amen when he came on on the scene it says for if the ministration of condemnation be glory much more do the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory praise God and U for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this Respect by reason of the glory that excelth the the New Living Translation says it this way in fact that first Glory was not glorious at all compared with the overwhelming glory of the new way for if that which is done away was glorious much more that which remaineth is glorious seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech in New Living test translation says since this new way gives us such confidence we can be very bold amen we can be very gold so bold so so because amen what Jesus Christ amen he's fully shining now amen shining in a group of people amen call the bride in this hour praise God that tra that that that Glory has been transferred over now I'm I'm just going quickly I uh trying to finish up here and and he says here uh that's why I encourage you to read the whole chapter uh it's only 18 verses so I think you can do that but we we we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are CH are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord and in the New Living Translation says it like this so all of us who have had the that Veil removed can see and reflect the glory of the Lord amen when was Moses uh face shining when he'd go up back in the mountain Amen to talk to God and receive the word he'd remove the veil right yes therefore he could receive that glory amen we have a veil that's been removed the veil of the world the veil of of of not understanding the word amen that has been removed amen and so we have the opportunity in this hour to sh the glory of the of the word amen and to the people and the Lord who is the spirit makes us more and more like him as we are changed into his glorious image praise the Lord amen now real quick Jesus wanted to share that Glory with us amen and and and in John 17 he prays and he says uh that all that may be one as thou father are in me and I in thee that they also may be one in US that the world may believe that thou has sent me amen and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them amen that they may be one even as we are one praise the Lord that's what God wants Amen to share his glory with us that's why Paul was saying that this this this this uh this change amen is changing us from Glory back to Glory from the original Glory back to that original glory and it's just like the seed amen the word of God who what who is the seed which is the seed amen this seed when it comes in us it's glorious it's got to go back to the seed praise God so it's changing us from glory to glory amen amen and you can read you can read this here and now this glory is changing now because we're part of him amen the Bride of Jesus Christ she gets the exact same Glory that he got amen and that Moses got amen That Glory is is in the bride of Christ amen and she's made up of millions of people amen praise the Lord throughout all the ages now I'll finish with this the Mighty God unveiled before us the seed come backs to its original Glory look the old Badger skins we find out behind it was inside of there was the word a amen praise God in the Tabernacle amen of Moses the word was in that Tabernacle praise God there also was the showbread it's interesting brother Brandon was talking about these things in the message that that the that they were playing just right before we started the ark was sprinkled and what was it the shika Glory was in there amen now the word is a seed and it cannot bring forth until the sun strikes it the sun's got to be upon the seed to make it be to make it come forth amen and that's the only way you take the word take the word of God in your heart and walk into the shakana glory and when you do it'll bring showbread Mana that that's only give for a separated people amen this word is going to separate you amen the only thing that can eat it that's permitted to eat it is just the people who are permitted and notice Paul said here changing from glory to glory you see finally it comes to its back to its original Glory it's just like a seed of a morning glory praise the Lord musicians may come up praise God so this is what this glory is to is to be amen we've got this word that's working in US amen it's got to be changing us amen from Glory the original Glory back to that original Glory right amen which is from I come from God I go back to God Amen amen who he is is who I am praise the Lord Jesus amen if you if you just um just look at it yourself and Ponder these things amen study them out cuz I believe you'll get some really good nuggets there if you if you meditate uh on on these things God bless you and thank you for your patience this morning [Applause]
