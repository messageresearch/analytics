[19:32] okay
[19:33] Genesis 2 I mean uh Romans 8 and Genesis
[19:38] 2. the heavenly father we thank you
[19:41] for this day in the hour that we have
[19:43] and for the time that we've been able to
[19:45] come together and to and you just sat
[19:48] down for a little bit and take a little
[19:49] time this morning out of the hustle and
[19:51] bustle of the business of our life to be
[19:54] able to just sit down and and talk about
[19:57] you a little bit and fellowship Lord and
[19:59] that's truly what we love to do
[20:01] and we ask you to just come Among Us
[20:03] this morning and open Thy word unto us
[20:05] because that's our desire is to speak
[20:08] about you
[20:09] and Lord to just have you have your way
[20:11] with each and every one of us forgive
[20:13] our sins and cleanse Us by the blood and
[20:16] keep us in your grace have your way
[20:18] bless those that are not here today
[20:19] remember the sick among us you said that
[20:22] you sent your word and healed us and
[20:24] delivered us from destruction so we
[20:26] believe you we commit it in your hands
[20:28] now have your way in Jesus name
[20:30] amen
[20:32] Romans eight we've been reading this for
[20:36] quite a while because we're we're on the
[20:38] basis of of talking about predestination
[20:41] and how that God predestinates by his
[20:44] foreknowledge
[20:45] now we've got over endogenesis to kind
[20:48] of see life upon Earth
[20:51] and the coming into these things so just
[20:54] remember this Romans 8 28.
[20:57] and we know that all things work
[20:59] together for good to them that love God
[21:01] to them who are the called according to
[21:04] his purpose for whom he did for no he
[21:06] did also predestinate to be conformed to
[21:10] the image of his son that he might be
[21:11] the firstborn among many brethren
[21:14] moreover whom he did predestinate then
[21:17] he also called in whom he called them he
[21:19] also justified in whom he justified them
[21:23] he also glorified now I love this part
[21:25] right what shall then shall we then say
[21:29] to these things in the words if all this
[21:31] is right what do we say
[21:33] if God be for us
[21:35] who can be against us
[21:37] that's a wonderful thing let's go over
[21:39] to Genesis two
[21:43] and we'll pick up
[21:46] verse 7
[21:51] and the Lord God formed man of the Dust
[21:54] to the ground and breathed into his
[21:55] nostrils to the Breath of Life
[21:58] and Man became a living soul
[22:00] the Lord God planted a garden
[22:03] Eastward in Eden and there he put the
[22:05] man whom he had formed and out of the
[22:07] ground made the Lord God to grow every
[22:10] tree that is Pleasant to the site
[22:12] and good for food the tree of life also
[22:15] in the midst of the garden and the tree
[22:17] of knowledge of Good and Evil now notice
[22:20] two trees
[22:22] one of them is the Tree of Life
[22:24] and we know for certain the tree of life
[22:26] is Jesus Christ
[22:28] because without him there is no life so
[22:31] that's easy to understand that that we
[22:33] talk about the tree of knowledge of Good
[22:35] and Evil
[22:37] what kind of a tree is that all right
[22:39] verse 16 to just pick up the point
[22:42] 15 he put man in the garden to dress the
[22:45] garden 16 and the Lord God commanded a
[22:48] man saying of every tree of the garden
[22:50] thou mayest freely eat
[22:52] but of the tree of the knowledge of Good
[22:55] and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in
[22:57] the day that thou eat us thereof thy
[23:00] surely die he may be seated the Lord
[23:03] that is blessing to the reading of the
[23:06] word
[23:08] now
[23:11] we have been up and down in backwards
[23:13] and forth and doing a lot of things and
[23:16] I thought today uh we would just try to
[23:18] take a lot of scriptures and deal with
[23:21] that
[23:22] in uh understanding but we we certainly
[23:26] believe the word of God
[23:28] I believe it's true and and believe it's
[23:30] forever settled and we don't have to
[23:32] worry about it because it is his word
[23:34] and who else's word could we take
[23:37] outside of the word of God because he
[23:40] gave us his word all right now
[23:43] as we've studied for quite a bit now
[23:45] talking about it this two trees as I
[23:48] said we know that Jesus Christ is a tree
[23:51] of life
[23:52] because there's no life outside of
[23:53] Christ there's no no life outside of God
[23:57] coming down and fellowshipping with man
[24:02] and then dying for our sins to pay the
[24:04] price that you and I could receive
[24:07] eternal life
[24:08] all right so it's easy to understand the
[24:10] Tree of Life
[24:12] all right but remember there was another
[24:14] tree there called a tree of knowledge of
[24:16] Good and Evil now we know that Jesus
[24:18] Christ the physical body you know human
[24:21] element man
[24:23] uh was not standing in the garden
[24:28] there was trees you know the whole
[24:31] garden was full of trees but it it
[24:34] singles out to trees to speak of there
[24:38] and we know that as I said Jesus Christ
[24:41] wasn't standing there as a person
[24:44] all right
[24:46] but he was there in the symbolic of the
[24:48] Tree of Life
[24:50] all right we know Satan is
[24:53] uh a spirit being
[24:56] created spirit being
[24:58] he's not a man like a human man element
[25:02] uh and all like that we talk about the
[25:06] guy with the two horns you know and we
[25:08] all of those things but uh remember he's
[25:12] a spirit being was created he was the
[25:15] anointed cherub the Bible covers in
[25:17] Ezekiel and Isaiah
[25:19] and how that he was in Eden
[25:22] and he was Dire in representation
[25:26] as
[25:28] Christ was Dire in representation of the
[25:31] Tree of Life
[25:32] all right but now I've asked you
[25:34] questions over and over about it
[25:37] what kind of a tree is it that you could
[25:39] look at and it would be a tree of
[25:41] knowledge
[25:43] a tree of knowledge
[25:46] of Good and Evil what kind of a tree is
[25:48] that I would like to know about that
[25:51] tree if you could help me uh my oh I'm I
[25:54] don't have Alzheimer's I got old timers
[25:58] and my memory is going away and I sure
[26:01] would like to be able to eat some of
[26:03] these things if you know that would help
[26:06] me you do the best you can with the
[26:08] herbs and things that comes out of the
[26:10] Earth but boy wouldn't it be something
[26:12] to to be able to eat of a tree of
[26:14] knowledge of Good and Evil you know if
[26:16] it was just something to eat of but
[26:19] remember in the Bible
[26:22] that when it's speaking of these things
[26:24] remember it is written
[26:27] so that the wise and prudent the
[26:29] scripture says would miss it
[26:33] but the babes in Christ would that was
[26:36] what Jesus said about it would be able
[26:38] to receive it
[26:39] all right
[26:41] so now they were told that they could
[26:43] eat of all the trees
[26:45] that was in the garden verse 17 there we
[26:48] got to 16 and
[26:50] you know in other words I could eat the
[26:52] apples they could eat the pears the
[26:53] peaches the plums the you know all of
[26:55] the trees
[26:57] that was in the garden
[27:00] but they were told verse 17.
[27:03] to not eat of the tree of knowledge
[27:08] of Good and Evil
[27:09] God if he did that day you would die all
[27:12] right at this specific time in verse or
[27:14] chapter 2 we know that Eve had not come
[27:17] into being yet Adam was still there if
[27:20] you read your Bible you know and Eve was
[27:22] in Adam a rib was taken out of Adam over
[27:25] into the second chapter going toward the
[27:28] end
[27:29] and made Eve out of it you know all
[27:32] right because that was making her a part
[27:34] of him and he said this is Flesh of My
[27:37] Flesh and bone of my bones which was
[27:39] right you know that would have been the
[27:40] truth because she came out of him
[27:43] the other animals were created male and
[27:45] female dog male and female horse male
[27:47] and female cow you know well uh the
[27:51] animals but when it comes to creation of
[27:54] mankind he created Adam if you'll read
[27:56] chapter 2 there
[27:59] and he created him but Eve was in Adam
[28:03] all right then God separated or took a
[28:05] rib and took it out and and made a body
[28:09] he didn't take her from the dust of the
[28:11] earth like he did the other female
[28:12] animals because he was going to make her
[28:16] very close to Adam
[28:18] Flesh of My Flesh and bone of my bone he
[28:20] said that's why that a man is to leave
[28:22] his father and mother and cleave to his
[28:25] wife
[28:26] it doesn't say for the girl to have to
[28:28] leave her mom and daddy
[28:30] right
[28:31] yeah
[28:33] all right it says for the man
[28:35] you know to leave his father and mother
[28:37] and cleave to his wife and they become
[28:40] one
[28:41] all right and he made him a help meat
[28:44] not a help mate we want to translate
[28:46] that a lot of times mate but it's not in
[28:48] the Scripture it says make him help meat
[28:50] someone like him are with him or part of
[28:54] him all right and when that happened
[28:57] then they were put in the garden to
[29:00] uh you know to
[29:03] be happy and have a good time
[29:06] and in verse 25 you find a very unusual
[29:10] situation
[29:13] because it says and they were both naked
[29:17] the man and his wife
[29:20] and we're not ashamed
[29:23] we look at things you know in a way as a
[29:25] human beings because as I tried to
[29:28] explain the other day you you take there
[29:30] a while back you take those little kids
[29:32] uh one two maybe three years old you
[29:36] might put a little boy in the bathtub
[29:37] with a little girl it might not be too
[29:39] bad but after the good little age on
[29:41] them don't do that
[29:43] oh but my kids don't know your kids just
[29:45] like everybody else
[29:48] according to the psalmist David
[29:51] he said we were born in sin shaping an
[29:54] iniquity
[29:55] and a spouse from our mother's wound
[29:58] a liar
[30:00] you know you look down at a little baby
[30:02] and you don't want to say it because
[30:03] it's derogatory against it but you look
[30:05] at it and you say that well look look at
[30:07] that little liar laying there
[30:09] you don't teach a baby how to lie it
[30:12] gets to be a couple of years old and
[30:13] it's got cookie all over its mouth
[30:15] cookie all over his hand and you ask I
[30:17] said you got to cook and he said
[30:19] see that's because we were born into
[30:23] Satan's domain because of the fall in
[30:27] the garden
[30:28] all right now whatever you do remember
[30:33] what happened in the garden was unbelief
[30:37] we first must approach it that way
[30:39] because that's the truth of it it's
[30:41] unbelief
[30:43] see they didn't believe Eve didn't
[30:45] believe God would keep his word
[30:49] all right so we're going to read that in
[30:50] just a second and get into it she didn't
[30:52] believe God would keep his word
[30:54] she was deceived but remember
[30:59] she went into unbelief
[31:02] there is only one sin
[31:04] that's unbelief drinking gambling
[31:07] smoking running around with women is an
[31:09] attribute
[31:10] or a display
[31:13] of the unbelief
[31:15] see before a woman can receive a man she
[31:18] has to First receive him in her spirit
[31:20] being or in other words her reasoning or
[31:22] memories or Consciousness before
[31:24] anything literal can take place all
[31:27] right
[31:28] but see two trees now
[31:31] what kind of a tree would be the tree of
[31:33] knowledge
[31:36] instead of Good and Evil
[31:38] and like I always say we rode to church
[31:40] today and needed just a little bit of
[31:43] heat you know because it was cool and
[31:46] it wasn't like the old days riding in a
[31:48] horse and buggy you know and
[31:49] or riding away models when you didn't
[31:51] have anything or
[31:53] it was
[31:55] there's some good about a lot of things
[31:58] scientific knowledge is good to a degree
[32:02] and that's wonderful
[32:03] you know I I like a house that's warm
[32:07] and I don't have to go out and cut all
[32:09] the wood and build a fire which is
[32:11] enjoyable to do and a lot of people do
[32:13] that and Heat their homes but you know
[32:15] I'm just a little lazy I guess and I
[32:18] just kind of on that style I heard the
[32:20] turn the thermostat up
[32:22] scientific knowledge we ride on
[32:24] airplanes we we go about the country you
[32:27] know where it used to take a year to
[32:29] cross the United States Maybe
[32:31] but now you can just get in a plane
[32:32] there you are and that's that's all of
[32:35] that scientific knowledge you remember
[32:37] that come off the tree of knowledge
[32:39] all right
[32:41] but now get back to the point
[32:43] if the tree of life would be symbolic
[32:47] of Jesus Christ
[32:50] for by him came life
[32:52] then what would be the tree of knowledge
[32:54] of Good and Evil and why would God tell
[32:58] Even Adam before Eve was taken from him
[33:02] to not partake
[33:04] of that tree of knowledge and good and
[33:06] evil because in the day you do you're
[33:08] going to die
[33:09] well all right they did partake of that
[33:12] tree
[33:13] now physically speaking they never died
[33:16] that day
[33:18] all right
[33:19] but they died in less than a thousand
[33:22] years because Methuselah was 969 years
[33:24] old the oldest man you know and Mankind
[33:28] has never lived a thousand years
[33:31] 969 pretty close but they still didn't
[33:34] live all right now I'm quoting scripture
[33:37] just coming through
[33:39] Anna
[33:40] see then it was told the day you eat
[33:42] thereof that day you die
[33:45] all right
[33:46] so the Bible says a thousand years a day
[33:49] and a day is a thousand years that's
[33:50] scripture all right so we can say well
[33:53] God created the world in six days you
[33:57] know or whatever
[33:58] or we could say he created six thousand
[34:00] years what would it make any difference
[34:02] because a thousand years is a day in a
[34:04] day is a thousand years so we're
[34:07] covering the point of understanding
[34:10] all right but this tree of life if it
[34:14] was symbolic of Jesus Christ
[34:17] now then the tree of knowledge of Good
[34:19] and Evil would be symbolic of Satan
[34:22] right
[34:24] because he'd already been kicked out of
[34:26] heaven
[34:28] he got exalted in his unbelief
[34:33] and what is it Isaiah or Ezekiel 1 said
[34:36] heart thou fallen from Heaven o Lucifer
[34:37] son of the morning see he was the
[34:40] anointed cherub that was created perfect
[34:43] in his doings but he went in his own
[34:45] ways in his own knowledge and it took
[34:47] him into unbelief and God gave him the
[34:50] right of free moral agency to be able to
[34:52] choose and he chose to do wrong because
[34:54] he wanted to be number one
[34:56] all right
[34:58] so when it happened in the garden that
[35:00] God created man
[35:05] Satan could not create
[35:07] it can cause a lot of confusion right
[35:10] but he can't create that's withholding
[35:13] from it because that was the ability
[35:15] that God had alone
[35:17] to be able to create man and to do what
[35:19] he was doing the world with Satan could
[35:22] pervert
[35:24] all right so his his goal was to come to
[35:27] Earth and cause the same thing he did in
[35:29] heaven
[35:30] which was war
[35:32] according to Revelations 12 and said
[35:35] Michael and his angels fought
[35:37] and Lucifer and his angels fought and he
[35:39] was cast out of Heaven that was not
[35:41] necessarily a war of movies
[35:46] it was a a an order or uh bringing to
[35:50] the place that those demons could not
[35:53] stay there any longer
[35:55] and they were cast out
[35:57] but he came to Earth and and those
[36:00] demons are the things that anoint you
[36:02] and I
[36:04] you say no well what causes the baby to
[36:07] lie
[36:09] you laughed at that a minute ago and
[36:11] shook ahead yeah but what caused the
[36:13] baby to lie
[36:15] it was not Mom and Daddy they didn't lie
[36:19] right
[36:21] see we're born in Satan's domain Kingdom
[36:25] all right you remember he offered it to
[36:28] Jesus you remember when they went up on
[36:30] the mountain not in the scripture in the
[36:32] gospel
[36:33] and see Satan offered all of these
[36:35] things to Jesus and he said ah
[36:38] well see Satan has control look at him
[36:40] he's really the prince and power of the
[36:42] hour out here he's you know these storms
[36:45] and things are not of God they can be
[36:48] used of God to do whatever but
[36:51] it's Satan's domain
[36:54] something happened in the garden that
[36:55] brought death upon mankind
[36:58] and that that happened was the horrible
[37:01] situation
[37:03] now first it was for Eve to disbelieve
[37:06] God's word
[37:08] she started as we'll read in explaining
[37:12] because ours where our Trouble Comes we
[37:15] all like to think we have a good bit of
[37:17] knowledge
[37:18] you know we like to think that we know
[37:21] something
[37:22] and we enjoy
[37:24] telling other people how we know you
[37:26] sisters love to talk about how to cook
[37:30] you know
[37:31] but you don't want to talk to my wife
[37:33] about how to cook even though she's the
[37:35] best cook in the building
[37:38] I don't back off of that at all right
[37:41] most of you will agree with it
[37:44] but when you ask her said how do you do
[37:46] this you said you take a pinch of salt
[37:49] and a shake of sugar and she never
[37:52] measures anything
[37:56] but it turned out wonderful
[37:58] why because she's learned to measure
[38:01] but what she's doing
[38:04] all right now if you read a recipe
[38:06] recipe that my wife gave you and she
[38:08] said a pinch of salt you'd say well how
[38:11] much is a pinch you know
[38:14] I mean you know
[38:16] and what's this much he'll say put this
[38:19] much
[38:20] Greece you know what you call it
[38:23] crisco's whatever what you call it
[38:25] you know you put that much
[38:27] well the recipe says put a cup
[38:30] well she's got the cup
[38:33] all right what are you talking about
[38:36] the main point is talking about that
[38:41] when we read the Bible
[38:44] let's read the Bible for itself
[38:48] and not read it for somebody that's
[38:50] interpreting
[38:51] the pinch
[38:53] or the cup
[38:55] or how much
[38:57] what is reading What God Says
[39:00] but when he said something remember
[39:03] that
[39:05] he's hiding it
[39:08] according to what he said in the gospels
[39:10] now
[39:11] he said I think the old father thou has
[39:13] hid these things
[39:15] from the wise and prudent right and what
[39:18] and revealed it unto babes such as we'll
[39:21] learn
[39:22] all right
[39:24] so we need to think about a lot of
[39:26] things
[39:28] but this tree of knowledge now
[39:31] it's not a literal tree no more than the
[39:33] tree of life was a literal tree but it's
[39:36] the tree of life was Jesus Christ and
[39:37] symbolic then the tree of knowledge of
[39:40] Good and Evil which brought death
[39:42] would have to be symbolic in the basis
[39:44] of
[39:45] Satan the devil Lucifer whatever you
[39:49] want to call him
[39:50] it would have to be in a symbolic form
[39:54] because
[39:56] he would not be their standing there
[39:59] see he's he's right here in the church
[40:01] today but so is Christ right here
[40:05] because that's in another world of
[40:07] spirit Realm that we we don't see all
[40:11] right but now
[40:14] thinking about it
[40:19] a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[40:27] Satan will give you so much good
[40:31] to try to attract your attention
[40:34] right
[40:36] as I covered a second ago
[40:38] he offered Jesus
[40:41] and we know Jesus Christ came to die
[40:43] right
[40:44] to save the world save everybody right
[40:47] but everybody won't be saved but he come
[40:49] for that still
[40:50] and he come to save the world even and
[40:52] it will one day be changed and
[40:56] all right
[40:58] so it was placed there within him to
[41:03] you know
[41:05] bring life
[41:07] is placed in Satan in his foolings in
[41:10] his nature and ways is to bring death
[41:14] and that's why we can follow it through
[41:15] the scriptures
[41:18] but so much good of it sometimes is real
[41:21] good but it's
[41:23] it turns out to be bad
[41:25] all right now
[41:28] so remember the two trees
[41:30] symbolic of Jesus Christ symbolic of
[41:33] Satan
[41:36] all right
[41:37] as I said we think of Satan with the
[41:39] horns
[41:40] we think of him as the bad guy
[41:42] we think of him as the devil
[41:46] but remember
[41:48] he used that beast in the garden we'll
[41:51] read in a second
[41:53] to talk to Eve
[41:57] all right
[41:59] he's a spirit being he can do things
[42:02] he's great
[42:03] don't think in even Bible the Bible said
[42:06] Daniel
[42:07] was not a match for the devil
[42:10] and don't you think you and I are ever a
[42:11] match for him either
[42:13] you think you're a match for the Devil
[42:15] he's done got you you don't want to
[42:16] worry about it
[42:17] Jesus Christ is the only one that could
[42:19] ever conquer the devil
[42:21] even over in the Book of Daniel you
[42:23] remember the great great Archangel
[42:25] Gabriel
[42:27] was coming to Daniel read the book of
[42:29] Daniel
[42:30] and as he was coming to Daniel the Bible
[42:32] said he was hindered 21 days
[42:35] he couldn't get to Daniel because
[42:38] the devil was hindering him
[42:40] so Christ had to come on and say Michael
[42:43] came to the aid of Gabriel
[42:45] and he took over and
[42:49] Gabriel could come on to Daniel
[42:52] all right
[42:53] getting a little story in the Bible
[42:55] terminologies of what we're talking
[42:57] about
[42:59] so remember you're not playing with just
[43:01] something that's
[43:03] not strong and deceiving and
[43:08] and deliberately
[43:10] remember as I said he offered Jesus
[43:14] the world
[43:16] and as I was saying that why did Jesus
[43:18] come forth
[43:19] to die for the world right
[43:22] and he offered it to him
[43:25] in other words he said you don't have to
[43:26] die
[43:28] see Satan is very very shrewd he has a
[43:32] knowledge even of the principles of life
[43:34] he knows all the things he knew what
[43:36] Jesus Christ was here for
[43:40] and he said I'll give it to you
[43:44] but Jesus said no I've got to pay the
[43:47] price
[43:49] hey
[43:50] he offered him the opportunity to bypass
[43:53] death
[43:55] but he rejected that because he knew
[43:59] what that would mean
[44:00] just remember when somebody comes along
[44:02] wants to give you something
[44:04] you get them phone calls right
[44:07] we are in your area and we are doing
[44:10] this and we would like to give you
[44:12] you better hang up
[44:16] don't say well I might listen to you
[44:20] no you better hang up because anything
[44:23] that's free
[44:26] has got some links to it
[44:32] the prophet would say about Jesus he
[44:35] knew if he took that as Satan offered it
[44:38] Satan would still have his ear marks on
[44:40] it
[44:41] so we're going to let him have his hands
[44:43] on none of it you remember Abraham
[44:46] was offered a burial place for his wife
[44:49] Sarah when she died you remember that in
[44:51] the Bible
[44:52] what's Christ there what's what happened
[44:56] Abraham said no I purchased the property
[44:58] the man said I'll give it to you
[45:00] they said no I purchase the property
[45:04] because you don't know no uh it's good
[45:08] and evil
[45:11] which is not a good in it but then it
[45:13] turned out evil
[45:14] and runs in the wrong direction all
[45:16] right see now think about that as we go
[45:19] along into
[45:21] thinking of what we're saying that
[45:26] the devil is
[45:29] he comes to you in a way that's real
[45:31] soft and nice
[45:33] I've heard people say you know no I said
[45:36] the devil's talking to me
[45:38] well I
[45:40] I agree he does
[45:42] but now how are you going to know the
[45:43] difference between the devil talking to
[45:45] you and God talking to you
[45:47] oh brother Dale the devil talks mean and
[45:51] rough and tough and the Lord said oh I
[45:55] love you
[45:58] that's not exactly all the Bible
[46:00] what about when God sometimes tells you
[46:04] sit down and shut up and listen
[46:07] remember when they were offering them an
[46:10] opportunity there to to
[46:13] the animals in the temple when the poor
[46:15] old people couldn't go out and do much
[46:16] and they set it up in the temple and
[46:18] they said well sure we'll just put a
[46:19] place in here we'll put some animals in
[46:21] here
[46:23] and we'll
[46:24] we'll sell you the animals
[46:26] you don't have to go out and
[46:29] and here comes Jesus alone what'd he do
[46:32] he took a rope and he planted it
[46:35] which meant it took him a little time
[46:38] he thought it over
[46:40] and he started frailing the Daylights
[46:42] out of him and run them out of the
[46:43] Temple
[46:44] right
[46:45] didn't sound too good did it
[46:48] but he said you took my house this to be
[46:51] a house of prayer and you made it to den
[46:53] of Thieves
[46:56] the condo priest was standing there
[46:57] saying but I'm the one that let them do
[47:01] this
[47:02] which one sounded like it was the best
[47:04] guy
[47:07] come on
[47:09] that's how Satan does
[47:12] he's very deceiving
[47:16] he's very slow about doing it
[47:20] doesn't bother him to take a long time
[47:22] to talk to you
[47:24] what we're going to get into in the
[47:25] garden just remember it was not a five
[47:28] minute affair
[47:31] no telling how long the devil talked
[47:33] through the Beast
[47:39] to Eve
[47:41] before he got her into unbelief
[47:45] all right
[47:48] see it's not just a whole lot of doings
[47:50] it's whether or not we can stay you say
[47:52] well how do you know then as I said how
[47:55] do you know whether it's God talking to
[47:57] you or whether it's the devil talking to
[47:59] you
[48:01] go back and check it in the word to see
[48:04] what's right
[48:06] right
[48:07] you remember there in the Bible where
[48:09] that came up there who was it Ahab and
[48:13] um Jehoshaphat what was his name
[48:14] Jehoshaphat anyhow
[48:19] they had 400 Hebrew Prophets
[48:24] that all prophesied to go up the God has
[48:26] given you the land we remember Micah
[48:29] he said no the Lord didn't tell me that
[48:32] the Lord told me you're going to be
[48:34] destroyed
[48:35] well you know who they're going to
[48:36] believe the four Hebrews for 100 400
[48:39] prophets over one man
[48:41] but yet he was telling them the word why
[48:43] because he had went back in the word
[48:45] Maca hit
[48:46] and he had seen that God had already
[48:48] cursed Jezebel and Ahab and said the
[48:52] dogs will eat your bones
[48:54] all right check it with the words what
[48:57] I'm saying
[49:00] what anybody says to you go back to the
[49:02] Bible with it and see if the Bible says
[49:04] that
[49:09] you remember the good things are always
[49:11] the tantalizing
[49:13] you know
[49:15] sometimes God just says to Nicodemus you
[49:18] remember
[49:21] that you must be born again
[49:24] a man that was the most religious leader
[49:26] because he was called the teacher in
[49:28] Israel that's what Jesus referred to it
[49:31] the greatest of all and yet he rebuked
[49:33] him
[49:36] and says you don't understand what I'm
[49:37] talking about
[49:40] because you must be born again a man
[49:42] that had lived in church all of his life
[49:45] all he ever done was in church
[49:49] you know as we call it today
[49:51] serving God all of his life and here
[49:53] comes God to him
[49:55] he says you need to be born again
[49:58] well see that's what we need we need a
[50:00] new birth all right but now think about
[50:02] it
[50:04] two trees one symbolic of Satan one
[50:07] symbolic of Christ
[50:10] let's see the outcome of what would be
[50:13] partaking of that
[50:16] the prophet of God said it one day like
[50:18] this he said the Tree of Life
[50:20] was in the garden to remind Adam that
[50:23] his youth was being renewed daily
[50:25] or an ongoing process all right
[50:29] and you know they could eat of the Tree
[50:31] of Life
[50:34] those two tourists because they tell
[50:36] them there's only one tree that you
[50:38] can't eat of
[50:40] them remember as Adam was seeing
[50:43] life being renewed each day because his
[50:46] body was not eternal
[50:47] right
[50:49] and he was seeing his youth renewed
[50:51] then he could see Christ
[50:53] and he could follow that
[50:56] all right
[50:58] but to eat of the tree of knowledge of
[51:00] Good and Evil would be immediate death
[51:07] so which one do we want to eat off of
[51:09] today
[51:11] you know they're before us right now
[51:15] the same two trees it was dark
[51:17] right
[51:19] except before you and I right now
[51:21] and we don't blame Adam and Eve for
[51:23] watching what's going on now right
[51:26] remember we're all a free moral agent
[51:28] and remember we're all given as was
[51:31] called an age of accountability which
[51:33] nobody knows exactly what that is but
[51:35] you know because it's according to your
[51:37] mental ability
[51:38] and uh
[51:40] it's placed before us
[51:42] we can eat of what tree we want to eat
[51:45] of
[51:47] and to remember the word eat as we'll
[51:50] get to it in a minute
[51:51] the word eat is a word that's called it
[51:54] comes from a form of light partaking
[51:58] you know
[51:59] we ate some of brother Al's chili
[52:02] yesterday we ate some of your cookies
[52:04] and some of your your cakes that you
[52:07] made are wonderful
[52:10] but that means partaking
[52:14] see as I said we we read something and
[52:16] we we get the wrong concept because we
[52:19] don't consider
[52:21] are we like Nicodemus when Jesus said
[52:23] you must be born again what did he say
[52:26] you mean I've got to go now read your
[52:28] scripture I've got to go back in my
[52:31] mother's wound and come forth again
[52:34] that's all he could comprehend about
[52:36] what Jesus was saying
[52:39] but the original translation says Jesus
[52:42] was saying You must be born from above
[52:46] because born from the earth we do us no
[52:48] good
[52:50] all right
[52:52] so then let's get down to the
[52:54] understanding
[52:56] and read the Bible then as we see it
[53:00] and understand what it's saying
[53:05] and get it into the right understanding
[53:07] all right
[53:08] now
[53:09] so let's go over to and we'll put it up
[53:11] here where you can read it from
[53:12] that way
[53:13] you can read your Bible it'll be glad to
[53:15] let you take it out see where it's right
[53:16] or not unless the brothers make some
[53:18] goof up somewhere back there it's going
[53:20] to be out of the King James version you
[53:23] know I read other translations and
[53:25] things but I I still like the King James
[53:27] version because it's there and and this
[53:31] is really not the 1611 King James
[53:33] version because you don't even have that
[53:36] uh anybody's ever seen a 1611.
[53:39] um translation of the Bible it's about
[53:41] that big and yeah big it's you look on
[53:45] your thing and it says King James
[53:46] version well if you look you'll see that
[53:48] it was back in the best you can go well
[53:51] Schofield is 1909. uh you know into
[53:54] bringing it but the original King James
[53:56] version has a little bit different
[53:57] wordings but I've read some of it to
[54:00] check to see where and I I believe that
[54:02] we have the you know the King James
[54:05] version brought down to Modern time and
[54:08] I don't believe in the modern Doctrine
[54:10] or modern things of a lot of the Bibles
[54:14] that they bring good news for Modern Man
[54:17] Etc why do you want to change anything
[54:19] to be good news
[54:20] I thought the gospel was good news I
[54:24] thought you must be born again I didn't
[54:25] know that had to be translated I thought
[54:27] it had to be believed
[54:29] all right see then we don't need
[54:31] somebody to tell us what it is but yet
[54:33] it's good to read those things well
[54:35] let's just look and read
[54:38] let's talk about these things in the
[54:40] garden
[54:41] and just consider it a minute
[54:44] of what the Bible is actually saying
[54:47] now we got your story
[54:48] Adam and Eve Adam created and even Adam
[54:52] taken from Adam made into her own
[54:54] individual part of her and placed in the
[54:59] garden
[55:01] told they could eat of every tree that's
[55:03] in the garden
[55:04] but other tree of knowledge of Good and
[55:06] Evil not to eat of that because it would
[55:08] bring death
[55:10] right
[55:12] now you may not agree with what we speak
[55:14] here about it and talk about it but
[55:16] we'll just read the Bible to see what's
[55:18] right or not
[55:19] but remember the original sin is
[55:22] unbelief
[55:25] so what Satan done he got Eve to
[55:28] disbelieve God's word
[55:33] now that's that's the simple point
[55:36] that's the tree of knowledge of Good and
[55:37] Evil
[55:39] is for Satan to get you and I to
[55:41] disbelieve God's word
[55:45] see we're talking about Mankind that God
[55:47] is a good god I agree with you but he's
[55:49] also a just God
[55:53] we say he's a savior that's I agree with
[55:55] you but he's also a judge
[55:58] there's a lot about the Bible we must
[56:00] get together all right
[56:02] all right to understand it
[56:04] all right but remember now before we
[56:07] start and you you call it later and say
[56:09] well brother Dale this is not you the
[56:11] original sin is unbelief
[56:15] Jesus said if you believe not you're
[56:17] condemned already
[56:20] see that's scripture all right
[56:23] we must believe in God
[56:26] all right
[56:29] not just take our thoughts and our ideas
[56:31] and
[56:32] you know
[56:34] kind of like it a little bit it's
[56:37] whether or not it's true
[56:39] all right
[56:40] so remember now the background story
[56:42] behind this is Moses wrote Genesis
[56:45] Exodus Leviticus number of Deuteronomy
[56:48] the first five books if I didn't get
[56:51] five there is he wrote the first five
[56:53] books all right now how did Moses know
[56:56] what happened in the garden
[57:00] right
[57:03] I mean oh you get hand down stories you
[57:05] know what are you gonna no no no how did
[57:08] Moses know
[57:11] what happened in the garden
[57:14] how did he know about a garden or a tree
[57:17] of knowledge of good and evil or
[57:20] it was revealed unto him by the Lord you
[57:22] remember a prophet the word of God comes
[57:24] to the prophet so he wrote five books
[57:27] all right
[57:28] trying to get us to understand God in
[57:31] those five books now with all that
[57:34] behind us look at what it says
[57:37] Genesis 3 and 1 says now the serpent
[57:40] was more subtle which is a deceiving
[57:44] you know
[57:45] capable of doing things
[57:48] that any Beast
[57:50] of the we feel which the Lord God had
[57:52] made
[57:55] and he said unto the woman yea if God
[57:57] said he shall not eat of every tree of
[58:00] the garden now listen to it
[58:02] but remember first what it's saying
[58:05] there's a vast difference between a
[58:06] serpent and a beast
[58:09] right
[58:11] a serpent is a snake crawling animal
[58:15] Etc a beast is an upright creature
[58:19] all right
[58:20] now
[58:21] this animal as we talk about this Beast
[58:25] it could talk
[58:28] it did
[58:29] because Satan wasn't talking to Eve
[58:31] himself he was talking through the Beast
[58:35] all right
[58:37] as we tried to explain to you before had
[58:40] they brought that to us in school we
[58:42] wouldn't have had Darwin's theory
[58:46] and Darwin's theory he could follow up
[58:48] the chain of
[58:50] creation
[58:51] but when he got to to the monkey he
[58:54] couldn't cross over to the man
[58:57] it was withholding from him but he had
[58:59] he read the Bible and found out see
[59:02] this serpent
[59:05] the tree of knowledge the serpent
[59:08] was symbolic of Satan
[59:10] he's called a serpent in the Book of
[59:11] Revelations he's called a serpent
[59:13] Through the Bible
[59:15] like it says to Eve you know in second
[59:18] Corinthians 11 3.
[59:20] less through his sceptility the serpent
[59:23] that beguiled Eve
[59:25] or
[59:26] now
[59:27] what happened in the Garden that made
[59:29] this horrible situation that you and I
[59:32] exist in
[59:33] which we exist in our in a situation of
[59:35] death
[59:37] right
[59:38] no matter what you think you're getting
[59:40] older
[59:43] you know no matter what you think you
[59:45] can pretty up all you want to
[59:48] but you are getting older
[59:50] you know your husband can tell you honey
[59:52] you look prettier than you 20 years ago
[59:54] but just remember
[59:56] he's lying
[59:59] right
[1:00:02] because we're getting older that's just
[1:00:04] normal
[1:00:05] right
[1:00:06] the Bible says about Jesus
[1:00:09] you know it was about 33 years ago you
[1:00:10] know what the Bible said about him
[1:00:12] he said you're a man of not 50. in other
[1:00:15] words because of his his doings he wound
[1:00:17] up being looking like he was wore out
[1:00:19] that's why I like these two drawings of
[1:00:21] of Hoffman's and if you look at them
[1:00:24] real close this drawing was made of
[1:00:26] Hoffman by Hoffman of what he believed
[1:00:29] Christ looked like that's fine
[1:00:31] but that was made at 33 I mean at 30
[1:00:33] when he was 30 years of eight this one
[1:00:35] was made by Hoffman years later and he's
[1:00:39] called the 33. that's why I have those
[1:00:41] two you know why because I'm the one
[1:00:43] that caused him to age
[1:00:45] and I'm between that so I keep them
[1:00:47] there all right see age is death
[1:00:52] right
[1:00:53] it's just death whether we like it or
[1:00:55] not we're just dying
[1:00:58] but we need to find something about
[1:00:59] these trees is what's killing us
[1:01:03] because the tree of knowledge of Good
[1:01:05] and Evil is killing us
[1:01:07] hey
[1:01:09] like we said while ago I appreciate the
[1:01:10] automobiles but you know what there's
[1:01:12] more people killed every year in
[1:01:15] automobile accidents than any year of
[1:01:18] any war that we ever had
[1:01:23] right
[1:01:24] in the Hiroshima and nakasaki every how
[1:01:27] you pronounce those words when they drop
[1:01:28] those two bombs
[1:01:30] 100 000 people or more
[1:01:33] but yet there's a whole lot more than
[1:01:34] that killed in car wrecks
[1:01:37] because that's the tree of knowledge of
[1:01:39] Good and Evil well let's watch it get
[1:01:41] started
[1:01:42] so the serpent was more subtle than any
[1:01:45] Beast
[1:01:46] in the Bible simply telling you now
[1:01:48] we'll go through if we get time we'll go
[1:01:50] through and show
[1:01:52] that God cursed
[1:01:54] returned Genesis he cursed the Beast
[1:01:58] and it became a snake
[1:02:01] just called upon by barely shalt thou
[1:02:03] crawl right and duck shall be thy me he
[1:02:06] walked upright
[1:02:07] I don't think Eve would have been out
[1:02:08] there talking to a snake
[1:02:10] would you
[1:02:14] put a nice looking guy walk up you might
[1:02:16] talk to him
[1:02:18] right
[1:02:20] remember as I said Darwin he couldn't
[1:02:23] cross that link
[1:02:25] between man and the monkey have you read
[1:02:27] the Bible and found out there was a
[1:02:29] beast there
[1:02:33] that was an upright creature
[1:02:37] an animal
[1:02:39] uh situation that was close to the human
[1:02:45] he said well how do you know that
[1:02:46] because the Bible says it
[1:02:49] all right
[1:02:50] the Beast an upright creature
[1:02:54] the serpent snake that's easy to
[1:02:57] understand
[1:02:59] and as I said and I keep saying it I
[1:03:01] like to I like to repeat things because
[1:03:03] you know repetitive means you'll
[1:03:05] remember it
[1:03:08] he wouldn't talk to a snake
[1:03:11] she'd been more apt to talk to a monkey
[1:03:15] right
[1:03:18] I don't talk to snakes do you
[1:03:24] know
[1:03:25] but remember he wasn't a snake to start
[1:03:27] with
[1:03:29] why would God curse him and tell him up
[1:03:32] on your belly shall you crawl
[1:03:35] because he went some other way
[1:03:38] he was a beast
[1:03:42] a creature there that we don't talk
[1:03:44] about because we don't know about
[1:03:46] what the Bible knows about it but look
[1:03:49] and watch what he does
[1:03:51] and he
[1:03:53] the Beast
[1:03:55] he
[1:03:57] Satan talking through that Beast to Eve
[1:04:02] instead of the woman yeah hath God say
[1:04:04] it and watch him
[1:04:06] you shall not eat of every tree of the
[1:04:08] garden
[1:04:11] you know that's what God's he didn't say
[1:04:13] that did he
[1:04:16] now God never said that
[1:04:18] God said you could eat of every tree but
[1:04:21] of the tree of knowledge of Good and
[1:04:23] Evil
[1:04:24] so now here's a good woman preacher that
[1:04:26] we don't agree because this word started
[1:04:28] out because he was the first one have
[1:04:30] nothing against women
[1:04:33] you know I was born from one I have a
[1:04:35] good wife I have a good daughter-in-laws
[1:04:36] good daughter I don't know I I take I
[1:04:39] stand up for the Sisters
[1:04:41] but I also know that she was the first
[1:04:43] preacher because she preached to the
[1:04:45] devil
[1:04:48] right
[1:04:51] but look how tricky he was
[1:04:54] God never said
[1:04:56] you can't eat of evertree
[1:05:01] God says you can eat of every tree but
[1:05:04] to one tree
[1:05:07] so look how easily Satan is starting to
[1:05:09] talk to her
[1:05:10] now she comes back what does she say and
[1:05:13] the woman said unto the serpent
[1:05:14] we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of
[1:05:17] the garden
[1:05:19] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[1:05:21] the midst of the garden God has said You
[1:05:24] shall not eat of it neither shall you
[1:05:26] touch it lest you die she corrected him
[1:05:31] but that was his deception
[1:05:36] he got heard of talking
[1:05:39] there's the biggest problem not women
[1:05:41] that's us men and all remember
[1:05:44] the Bible says in Adam all die so we
[1:05:47] don't blame he for everything you know
[1:05:55] but the fruit of the tree which is in
[1:05:57] the midst of the garden God has said You
[1:05:58] shall not eat of it neither shall you
[1:06:00] touch it lest you die
[1:06:05] and the serpent said unto the woman
[1:06:09] he shall not surely die
[1:06:12] what for God doesn't know that in the
[1:06:14] day you eat the Earth then your eyes
[1:06:16] shall be opened and you shall be as gods
[1:06:19] knowing Good and Evil
[1:06:23] there's the tree right
[1:06:25] knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:06:29] her lust for knowledge
[1:06:32] brought unbelief
[1:06:35] into her being right
[1:06:39] you know like I walk up to you and I
[1:06:42] tell you something and see
[1:06:44] if I deceive you into getting you to
[1:06:46] talk
[1:06:48] I've got you trapped
[1:06:53] all I got to do is just get you to
[1:06:54] explain it to me
[1:06:58] I'm on your side
[1:07:00] the devil's not all that mean big old
[1:07:02] guy with the horns
[1:07:05] as a matter of fact the Bible says that
[1:07:07] his ministers are as the Ministers of
[1:07:09] righteousness which means preachers
[1:07:12] right
[1:07:13] preachers in the pulpits the most
[1:07:15] damaging thing
[1:07:17] why
[1:07:18] because they're going to tell you what
[1:07:19] they think God said
[1:07:24] he said well that's what you're going to
[1:07:25] do well let's see what it's right or not
[1:07:28] all right
[1:07:33] go and watch at him
[1:07:35] for God doesn't know that in the day you
[1:07:37] eat thereof then your eyes shall be open
[1:07:39] and you shall be as gods
[1:07:42] knowing Good and Evil
[1:07:46] right
[1:07:49] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[1:07:51] good for food
[1:07:56] and it was pleasant to the eyes and a
[1:07:58] tree to be desired to make one wise she
[1:08:01] took of the fruit in our oven to eat and
[1:08:03] gave also unto her husband with her and
[1:08:05] he did eat
[1:08:06] now
[1:08:09] people will say well what they've done
[1:08:10] in the garden is they ate an apple
[1:08:14] all right some of them come up and say
[1:08:16] well now they ate a pomegranate or a
[1:08:18] power or
[1:08:20] some form of fruit
[1:08:23] and we won't get time to get to it this
[1:08:25] morning but we've been over it you know
[1:08:27] that when Cain went to come to offer his
[1:08:29] offering
[1:08:31] you remember Abel offered the blood of
[1:08:33] the animal you remember that
[1:08:36] McCain offered the fruit of the land
[1:08:41] proven he still thought Mama knew what
[1:08:44] she was talking about
[1:08:46] why
[1:08:48] remember
[1:08:50] the first thing is he got her to
[1:08:53] disbelieve God
[1:08:57] are in other words to doubt God would
[1:09:00] keep his word
[1:09:01] right right
[1:09:03] because God said you die
[1:09:05] the devil slips around with it and he
[1:09:08] comes up to the point of saying you
[1:09:10] shall not die
[1:09:12] put it in plain language to us today
[1:09:14] what would he be saying God loves you
[1:09:18] we're not what we said while ago the
[1:09:20] world preaches today God is a good god
[1:09:24] that's wonderful
[1:09:25] it's a good God
[1:09:27] but he's also a god of judgment
[1:09:31] right
[1:09:32] he's a god of judgment
[1:09:33] all right
[1:09:35] but look what it says
[1:09:37] and saw that the tree was good for food
[1:09:41] right
[1:09:43] now
[1:09:46] I go blunt to start with and then back
[1:09:48] up all right
[1:09:51] I do not believe that you can cover
[1:09:53] anywhere in the Bible to talk about any
[1:09:55] form of a apple orange pomegranate Peach
[1:09:59] Plum whatever
[1:10:00] a fruit
[1:10:05] that would be the cause of the fall or
[1:10:07] the attribute that went with what they
[1:10:09] done first it was unbelief it's always
[1:10:12] got to be in that display
[1:10:17] now I ask you simple questions for you
[1:10:20] to think about
[1:10:23] if a if they ate any form of fruit any
[1:10:27] form
[1:10:28] a fruit
[1:10:31] why did Jesus Christ have to be born
[1:10:34] from a
[1:10:35] wound of a woman
[1:10:40] it's a simple question I'd like a simple
[1:10:43] answer
[1:10:44] why did Jesus have to come through the
[1:10:46] wound of a woman why couldn't God just
[1:10:47] step out he'd done it before he stepped
[1:10:49] out there in melchester
[1:10:51] right you know her Abraham read your
[1:10:54] Bible you come to Abraham one day Mel
[1:10:55] shattered it God in human flesh melt
[1:10:58] says that called him God
[1:10:59] I mean Abraham called him God
[1:11:02] he could create any time he wants to
[1:11:07] but why did he have to come through the
[1:11:09] wound of a woman
[1:11:14] and when they did wind up
[1:11:17] as the story Will Go On
[1:11:21] if they were eating apples oranges pears
[1:11:24] plums
[1:11:26] why was it that God
[1:11:29] killed the animals
[1:11:31] and put skins on
[1:11:35] and made a bloody atonement for him
[1:11:37] read your Bible
[1:11:40] read your Bible
[1:11:43] see if God
[1:11:45] made skins from the animals and covered
[1:11:48] them
[1:11:49] why didn't he give them a little patch
[1:11:51] to put over their mouth like brother
[1:11:53] Ernie Villanueva says why didn't he make
[1:11:54] a little thing to put up here if it was
[1:11:56] eaten
[1:11:58] now we're adults right
[1:12:01] we're adults
[1:12:04] when God made Adam and Eve's skins to
[1:12:06] cover them remember they had already
[1:12:09] made skins or coverings of fig leaves
[1:12:13] we'll get through that in the Bible read
[1:12:14] it they made them some coverage why
[1:12:18] because the ending of what it was said
[1:12:19] in Chapter 2 was that they were naked
[1:12:22] and knew it not
[1:12:26] but then when this situation took place
[1:12:29] they wound up being naked
[1:12:31] and they themselves made them fig leaves
[1:12:34] read your Bible
[1:12:39] to cover their body
[1:12:42] did you cover their mouth no
[1:12:46] no playing sensible as I said to start
[1:12:48] with put the kids in the bathtub one or
[1:12:50] two years old not no problem
[1:12:53] don't put them in there after you get
[1:12:54] three or four years old
[1:12:56] they're going to start figuring out what
[1:12:57] each other's got
[1:12:59] you say you I don't know a preacher or
[1:13:01] not talk like that why not you send your
[1:13:03] kids to sex education
[1:13:05] some idiot in school tells them all
[1:13:07] about it and describes it and even shows
[1:13:10] them how
[1:13:13] right
[1:13:15] well yet you'd say well the preacher or
[1:13:17] not use words like that why not
[1:13:20] sure we're human beings
[1:13:23] the Bible uses it
[1:13:25] why can't we
[1:13:28] he said well brother Dale what in the
[1:13:30] world do you think happened in the
[1:13:31] garden
[1:13:33] will you explain to me what happened
[1:13:41] why did Eve stage will read the minute
[1:13:43] the Beast
[1:13:46] he defiled he beguiled me
[1:13:51] why would she talk like that
[1:13:55] I hope I have time to get to it why
[1:13:57] would the Bible speak of Cain and Abel
[1:14:00] read your Bible
[1:14:02] 4 1.
[1:14:06] Adam knew his wife and she conceived and
[1:14:08] brought forth came
[1:14:12] and again Abel it doesn't say he had
[1:14:13] another time
[1:14:16] Cain and Abel were twins
[1:14:20] he said that's no problem I'm a twins
[1:14:24] but what about twins from different
[1:14:25] daddies
[1:14:28] you say no that can't be I've got to
[1:14:30] prove to lay in here if you want to talk
[1:14:32] about it or that they've proved that a
[1:14:34] woman can have a split over you know
[1:14:36] whatever you call it egg
[1:14:40] she can have enough fire with one man
[1:14:42] and not having a fire with her Hood when
[1:14:44] did we call it
[1:14:45] which would be intercourse there not in
[1:14:47] a fire
[1:14:48] and she can have children by two
[1:14:50] different men
[1:14:53] you say that's crazy
[1:14:55] science proves it right I don't have to
[1:14:58] argue I'm not arguing I'm preaching
[1:15:02] there was two kids
[1:15:04] the main thing I want to ask if I have
[1:15:06] time
[1:15:07] is how come Cain
[1:15:10] would be so robust about God to God in
[1:15:14] the face of God
[1:15:16] to say to God am I My Brother's Keeper
[1:15:20] when he'd already killed him
[1:15:23] where did that come from
[1:15:28] all right
[1:15:30] he said well brother Dale tell us flying
[1:15:31] okay in the garden
[1:15:34] Eve had an affair with a beast not a
[1:15:37] snake
[1:15:39] he was made of snake player and then
[1:15:42] that same day she had an affair with her
[1:15:44] husband our intercourse with her husband
[1:15:49] in there come Cain and Abel his twins
[1:15:51] read your Bible
[1:15:59] now
[1:16:00] if that's not true as I said again
[1:16:04] why would you make Leaves to cover
[1:16:07] themselves
[1:16:10] why would
[1:16:11] it come out to be in this day to
[1:16:13] understand human beings
[1:16:16] and why would Jesus Christ have to die
[1:16:18] to come through that wound to Die For
[1:16:21] You and I
[1:16:23] if the wound didn't have something to do
[1:16:24] with it
[1:16:26] hey we're adults I sit and talking to a
[1:16:30] lady in Jamaica one day
[1:16:32] explaining a few of these things to her
[1:16:34] turned around and looked at her I said
[1:16:35] look you're old enough to understand
[1:16:38] she was probably in her 50s
[1:16:40] I said you know what happened in the
[1:16:42] garden
[1:16:44] my daddy
[1:16:46] 45 years old before he married 13 kids
[1:16:49] later I come along
[1:16:51] I'm the baby of 13. I'm glad he saved
[1:16:54] the best of life
[1:16:59] my mom said One Day to my wife she said
[1:17:03] you know Sam's daddy told me one time he
[1:17:06] couldn't read she read the Bible and he
[1:17:09] asked her in life and said what do you
[1:17:10] think Hannah happened during the garden
[1:17:12] oh they ate an apple
[1:17:14] he said now that was her name Hannah he
[1:17:17] said now a hand he said
[1:17:19] I don't think that's exactly what it was
[1:17:23] he was 45 years old before he married an
[1:17:25] old Bachelor he knew a little bit about
[1:17:26] life
[1:17:28] all right
[1:17:29] that's not being derogatory or
[1:17:31] vulgaritas being truthful
[1:17:36] if you just sat down for a minute and
[1:17:38] think about it you know what happened in
[1:17:40] the garden
[1:17:41] you might not want to admit it because
[1:17:43] Cain didn't want to admit it
[1:17:46] you remember what Cain said over there
[1:17:48] I've offered My Sacrifice
[1:17:52] I believe it was fruit
[1:17:55] and God said if you'd offered it right
[1:17:57] I'd have accepted you
[1:18:01] brother Reynolds said if he had our done
[1:18:03] right he would have would have been
[1:18:05] accepted and said God went after him
[1:18:07] I've got these laying here
[1:18:09] he would have saved Cain if Cain had
[1:18:12] wanted to be saved
[1:18:15] that's brother Brown I'm getting people
[1:18:16] in the message argue and say that that's
[1:18:18] not true that's not go ahead I'm just
[1:18:20] trying to get into the scriptural point
[1:18:23] so what happened let's read real fast go
[1:18:25] ahead and pull it back up brother and
[1:18:26] let's read real fast you know what I
[1:18:28] believe I believe that they had on a
[1:18:31] fire in the garden
[1:18:33] and I'd like for you to explain to me
[1:18:35] what happened anything other than that
[1:18:40] you said that's not a vulgar thing no
[1:18:41] that's a beautiful situation because it
[1:18:44] explains why Jesus Christ had to come
[1:18:45] through a wound
[1:18:48] and it explains why Mary had to be a
[1:18:52] virgin
[1:18:58] come on
[1:19:04] see if we just ain't sensible
[1:19:07] a lot of the scripture starts opening up
[1:19:09] and a lot of the things get personal to
[1:19:11] us
[1:19:13] well I don't think we need to know what
[1:19:14] they've done
[1:19:15] well what was their own belief
[1:19:19] let's just deal with that
[1:19:22] and the woman saw that the tree was good
[1:19:24] for food and it was pleasant to the eyes
[1:19:28] you know
[1:19:31] and a tree
[1:19:32] to be desired to make one wise
[1:19:37] so it had to be the tree of knowledge of
[1:19:38] Good and Evil
[1:19:40] right
[1:19:42] she took of the fruit thereof and did he
[1:19:45] or put cook eat potato eat
[1:19:50] if you don't agree with that what about
[1:19:52] where Jesus said unless you eat my flesh
[1:19:57] is that scripture
[1:19:59] and drink my blood you have no part with
[1:20:02] me he wasn't talking about physically
[1:20:04] that's
[1:20:05] right he was talking about partaking
[1:20:10] right
[1:20:13] and the eyes of them both were open
[1:20:16] and they knew they were naked
[1:20:18] roll it up warm everybody can make sure
[1:20:21] and see it
[1:20:23] verse seven both were open and they knew
[1:20:26] they were naked
[1:20:28] if eaten apples will let people know
[1:20:31] they're naked I will personally Hawk
[1:20:34] everything I got to buy a few thousand
[1:20:36] dollars worth of apples and let you give
[1:20:38] them out
[1:20:40] right
[1:20:41] that's not joking
[1:20:45] apples give you bellyache
[1:20:52] but look
[1:20:54] what did they do the eyes of them both
[1:20:56] were open they knew that they were naked
[1:20:58] and they sold fig leaves together and
[1:21:00] made themselves aprons
[1:21:04] covered their bodies right
[1:21:07] and they heard the voice of the Lord God
[1:21:09] Walking In The Garden in the cool of the
[1:21:10] day and Adam and his wife hid themselves
[1:21:13] from the presence of the Lord God
[1:21:15] amongst the Trees of the garden
[1:21:18] and the Lord God called unto Adam and
[1:21:20] said unto him where art thou
[1:21:25] he said I heard thy voice in the garden
[1:21:28] and I was afraid because I was naked and
[1:21:32] I hid myself
[1:21:34] watch it
[1:21:37] and he said who told thee that thou was
[1:21:39] naked
[1:21:40] right
[1:21:42] half thou eaten of the free wherever I
[1:21:45] commanded thee that thou shouldest not
[1:21:47] eat what was that tree
[1:21:49] of knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:21:55] unbelief in God right
[1:21:57] but something else took place
[1:22:00] all right
[1:22:02] and the man said look at him
[1:22:04] back up four then talks about his wife
[1:22:07] look at him
[1:22:09] the man said the woman
[1:22:15] right blaming her
[1:22:18] right
[1:22:20] and the man said the woman thou gave us
[1:22:22] me
[1:22:23] gave us to be with me she gave me of the
[1:22:26] tree and I did eat it's your fault so
[1:22:29] you gave me that woman
[1:22:33] you said that ain't what it said will
[1:22:35] you read it tell me what else to say
[1:22:37] he was passing the buck right
[1:22:40] right now look what she turns
[1:22:44] and the Lord God said unto the woman
[1:22:47] what is this that thou has done and the
[1:22:49] woman said the serpent beguiled me and I
[1:22:52] did eat Look up the word be God when you
[1:22:55] get home I don't think you need to
[1:22:56] you're old enough to have sense but God
[1:22:59] means to defile
[1:23:02] deceive
[1:23:04] trick
[1:23:06] right
[1:23:09] and the Lord God said unto the serpent
[1:23:14] who's he talking to remember serpent was
[1:23:17] the most subtle of all bees
[1:23:20] now he's turned to speak to the beast
[1:23:22] but he's really speaking
[1:23:24] not only upon that beast but he was
[1:23:27] speaking to the devil that was doing the
[1:23:29] talking that's why it's called a serpent
[1:23:31] watch him
[1:23:33] the Lord God said unto the serpent
[1:23:34] because thou has done this Thou Art
[1:23:36] cursed above all cattle
[1:23:38] and above every beast of the field upon
[1:23:41] thy belly shalt thou go and thus shalt
[1:23:44] thou eat all the days of thy life
[1:23:48] a curse it was put on the Beast made him
[1:23:51] a snake
[1:23:53] put him on his belly
[1:23:56] cursed
[1:23:59] a beast
[1:24:01] now I ask you a simple question
[1:24:05] now this is serious to me whether it is
[1:24:07] to you or not but a simple question
[1:24:10] if it wasn't something connected with
[1:24:12] the
[1:24:14] animal in the form of enough fire and a
[1:24:17] beast you know remember the Beast was an
[1:24:19] upright creature
[1:24:21] if not so why was the animal
[1:24:26] made the atonement the Old Testament
[1:24:31] well when the apple tree made the
[1:24:33] atonement
[1:24:36] come on
[1:24:40] you said brother Dale you're just trying
[1:24:42] to get me to reason
[1:24:43] I'm trying to get you to have common
[1:24:45] sense
[1:24:47] whether it's called reason or what it is
[1:24:50] I'm just asking Bible questions simple
[1:24:52] why did the animal have to be made to
[1:24:54] sacrifice
[1:24:59] because the animal was used of Satan
[1:25:02] right to speak
[1:25:05] then it was made an atonement throughout
[1:25:07] the Old Testament why wasn't it made out
[1:25:10] of apple trees because Cain thought
[1:25:13] that's what it was and he brought
[1:25:16] come on he brought of the fruit of the
[1:25:19] land right
[1:25:21] and God rejected it
[1:25:24] Abel brought blood and God accepted it
[1:25:29] now go home and look this up
[1:25:33] the seed of man
[1:25:37] go look it up in your dictionary when
[1:25:39] you got home we're going to look it up
[1:25:40] in the Webster I mean the your internet
[1:25:43] you know
[1:25:45] the seed of man is highly congealed
[1:25:47] blood
[1:25:50] simple terminology just go look it up
[1:25:54] the seed of man is highly congeal blood
[1:25:56] the woman only produces an egg
[1:25:59] that's why the chicken you can lay all
[1:26:00] the eggs it won't do we didn't good
[1:26:02] unless it's been with a hint I mean a
[1:26:03] rooster right
[1:26:05] come on
[1:26:08] so what happened in the garden
[1:26:10] look
[1:26:12] he cursed the Beast but here's where
[1:26:15] we'll just have to stop because
[1:26:18] look
[1:26:20] God never left them in bad shape you
[1:26:22] think brother Dale you're just a
[1:26:23] doomsday preacher
[1:26:25] you just beat us down it looked like
[1:26:27] there's no hope for nothing
[1:26:32] I thought the Bible said You shall know
[1:26:33] the truth
[1:26:35] and the truth shall set you free
[1:26:38] he didn't say to know about truth it
[1:26:40] said You shall know the truth the Bible
[1:26:43] said they that no
[1:26:44] they're God shall do exploits
[1:26:48] job said I know
[1:26:52] My Redeemer liveth
[1:26:57] do you know your Redeemer Lives
[1:27:01] you know that God can keep his word
[1:27:04] all right look right in the middle of
[1:27:06] the whole thing before we get down to
[1:27:08] the woman and you explain to me let's
[1:27:10] read this and I'll read it for us in a
[1:27:12] hurry unto the woman he said I will
[1:27:14] greatly multiply the eating of the
[1:27:16] apples and give you the stomach ache
[1:27:21] you're supposed to be reading the Bible
[1:27:23] what does it say
[1:27:25] unto the woman he said I will greatly
[1:27:27] multiply thy sorrow
[1:27:29] and thy conception
[1:27:33] we're old enough to know
[1:27:35] in sorrow thy shall bring forth children
[1:27:40] and thy desire shall be to thy husband
[1:27:45] remember Adam and Eve standing in the
[1:27:47] garden beautiful power
[1:27:48] standing there co-equal with each other
[1:27:51] but look
[1:27:53] what it
[1:27:54] where we at okay
[1:27:56] and he shall rule over thee
[1:28:01] the man's supposed to be ruler of the
[1:28:03] house right
[1:28:04] why because what she done in the garden
[1:28:08] that's not blaming her because he went
[1:28:10] out with her
[1:28:12] well let's go back to the scripture and
[1:28:13] we'll quit
[1:28:14] look what he puts right in there right
[1:28:16] when mankind has come up to where that
[1:28:18] he's cursed the Beast and he's speaking
[1:28:20] to the man he's telling him about how
[1:28:22] he'll have to to to uh work and toil
[1:28:28] he curses the Beast and makes it a snake
[1:28:32] he turns around the back to Adam and Eve
[1:28:34] and look what he says
[1:28:36] I will put enmity
[1:28:38] between thee and the woman who's he
[1:28:41] speaking to
[1:28:43] Satan serpent
[1:28:46] enmity means division
[1:28:49] the Bible says that the carnal mind is
[1:28:51] an enemity against God
[1:28:53] right
[1:28:55] I will put enmity between thee and the
[1:28:58] woman what and between thy seed and her
[1:29:02] seed
[1:29:05] and it shall bruise thy head and thou
[1:29:08] shalt bruise his heel woman doesn't have
[1:29:09] a seed why would the bible say that
[1:29:14] the woman doesn't have a seed come on
[1:29:16] she has an egg
[1:29:19] doesn't have a seed
[1:29:22] that's the first promise of Jesus Christ
[1:29:25] written in the word of God
[1:29:29] all right
[1:29:30] between thy seed and her seed her seed
[1:29:33] all Bible scholars know to read it
[1:29:36] that's the first prophecy that Jesus
[1:29:38] Christ would come and die
[1:29:41] because Jesus Christ is the seed of the
[1:29:43] woman
[1:29:46] come on
[1:29:49] come on read your Bible he's the seed of
[1:29:51] the woman he come through the woman
[1:29:52] right
[1:29:55] a woman don't have no seed
[1:29:58] why would it say her seed her seed is
[1:30:02] Jesus Christ that was the promise that
[1:30:04] God would send the savior
[1:30:08] but if that be true then who is
[1:30:10] the other seed
[1:30:16] it's the seed of that Beast or the seed
[1:30:18] of that serpent the seed of that devil
[1:30:20] if you want to go back to your unbelief
[1:30:24] that is still right here with you and I
[1:30:26] today
[1:30:28] the seed of unbelief is still in all of
[1:30:30] us and that's where the trouble is at
[1:30:31] that's why we need a new birth and even
[1:30:33] with the new birth
[1:30:35] we need a whole lot more
[1:30:37] because the devil can still talk to us
[1:30:39] because that's what Paul said to the
[1:30:41] Corinthians he was writing to Christians
[1:30:42] in in Corinthians when he said let's
[1:30:46] you be tempted
[1:30:51] like Eve was
[1:30:53] beguiled by the serpent
[1:30:56] don't think this because we're
[1:30:57] Christians
[1:30:58] that we can go out and do wrong and get
[1:31:00] by with it
[1:31:03] right
[1:31:05] well it don't bother me
[1:31:09] maybe the reason it don't bother you
[1:31:11] because you're not born again
[1:31:14] in order bothers every day of what we do
[1:31:16] in life right
[1:31:21] but you see the seed of the serpent is
[1:31:22] still buzzing today
[1:31:25] right here
[1:31:27] to these heads
[1:31:30] that we are
[1:31:32] that seed of the serpent is still
[1:31:34] buzzing
[1:31:35] if you can't see what happened in the
[1:31:37] garden
[1:31:40] by reading the Bible
[1:31:44] we won't have time to get to it today
[1:31:46] but I want you to show me one thing
[1:31:49] I want somebody out there on the
[1:31:51] internet just going worldwide so I'm
[1:31:53] challenging the world to bring it
[1:31:55] not challenged but just tell you to
[1:31:57] bring it show me where Cain was ever
[1:31:59] listed in the lineage of Adam
[1:32:02] in the Bible
[1:32:07] it's not there
[1:32:09] Kane is not listed in the lineage of
[1:32:12] Adam Cain is not listed in the lineage
[1:32:14] of Jesus Christ Luke
[1:32:16] what is it three
[1:32:18] I believe that's right where's list the
[1:32:19] lineage and it comes down and it brings
[1:32:21] it down to Enos and us to say it was
[1:32:24] Enoch to Seth and coming down
[1:32:29] and it says to Adam which was the son of
[1:32:32] God
[1:32:33] Cain is nowhere in that lineage listed
[1:32:37] I want you to show it to me
[1:32:42] we read the Bible in Jude
[1:32:44] of course if you don't I can't remember
[1:32:45] exact verse but it's in the book of Jude
[1:32:47] which got only one chapter so you don't
[1:32:49] find it really easy it says in Job that
[1:32:51] Cain was of the wicked one
[1:32:56] why would he speak that way about Cain
[1:33:01] when he called him the wicked one
[1:33:03] who's the wicked one Satan
[1:33:09] unless you know what's in our dominance
[1:33:11] we're in the Bible
[1:33:13] he's a set of The Parables the sower
[1:33:15] went
[1:33:17] The Good Seed of the seed of the Kingdom
[1:33:21] but he said The Bad Seed is the seed of
[1:33:23] the wicked
[1:33:28] the Bible trying
[1:33:33] why can't we believe it
[1:33:36] man look oh we've never heard it maybe
[1:33:38] before
[1:33:39] but you heard it now
[1:33:41] he'll go home raise your Bible
[1:33:44] then come back let's talk about it
[1:33:47] I love to talk about the word of God it
[1:33:50] don't bother me if you come tell me I'm
[1:33:51] wrong
[1:33:53] haven't bothered me none whatsoever
[1:33:56] because if you're right I can be helped
[1:34:00] but if I'm right I ain't gonna worry
[1:34:03] about it
[1:34:04] I'm gonna be waiting on you to come tell
[1:34:05] me the truth
[1:34:11] why would it speak cocaine
[1:34:14] as it does in the Bible
[1:34:15] run in the ways of Cain
[1:34:18] right
[1:34:20] after the Arab Balaam
[1:34:23] what does it speak of Cain as it does
[1:34:25] but I want you to show me one lineage
[1:34:30] to Jude I believe it's in Austin John
[1:34:32] first John
[1:34:34] um Enoch the seventh from Adam
[1:34:37] read your Bible
[1:34:40] you put Cain in there Enoch is number
[1:34:42] eight
[1:34:48] read your Bible
[1:34:51] Enoch VII from Adam
[1:34:55] put Cain in in his eight of them
[1:34:59] so you're correct in the Bible go get
[1:35:01] your genealogies like I told you I'm not
[1:35:03] against people in their ways or thinking
[1:35:05] but there's a great group of people
[1:35:07] around the world that believe
[1:35:09] the tubala came
[1:35:13] is the seventh from Adam
[1:35:19] and they'll teach it to you in a hurry
[1:35:22] but that's on the wrong side of the
[1:35:24] lineage because you've got two lineages
[1:35:25] that started coming down
[1:35:28] but I want you to find me Cain in any
[1:35:30] lineage of Gods
[1:35:31] in the lineage of coming to Christ or
[1:35:33] the lineage coming from Adam as it says
[1:35:35] coming down because you get on over
[1:35:37] about the fifth chapter and it speaks of
[1:35:39] Adam and Adam knew his wife and she
[1:35:41] conceived and brought forth a son and
[1:35:43] called his name saith
[1:35:50] God's word is right let's stand
[1:35:53] I got about three minutes till 12 so
[1:35:55] let's just don't have anything and I'm
[1:35:56] sorry to be that long but I wanted to
[1:35:58] just cover these scriptures
[1:36:00] and get it in the right place
[1:36:02] that's all right musicians just
[1:36:04] let's just saying I love him anybody
[1:36:06] have a need we never want to leave
[1:36:07] without somebody you know if somebody
[1:36:09] has a need
[1:36:10] to be prayed for or whatever
[1:36:13] ah
[1:36:15] I love you
[1:36:21] why because
[1:36:33] judge my
[1:36:35] salary
[1:36:57] I have to have surgery okay for some
[1:37:01] lesions as on and from the circumcision
[1:37:03] they've done so let's just pray and
[1:37:05] believe
[1:37:06] that everything will be all right okay
[1:37:08] you believe it too
[1:37:11] because we believe right father
[1:37:15] in the name of Jesus Christ we lay our
[1:37:17] hands upon our little buddy here
[1:37:18] believing you that by your stripes he's
[1:37:20] healed and we thank you for it now we
[1:37:23] just committed into your hands that
[1:37:25] everything will be all right that even
[1:37:26] when they get to the doctors they won't
[1:37:28] even have to do nothing
[1:37:30] it'll be a miracle take place because we
[1:37:32] believe in it and we believe you Lord
[1:37:34] and we love you we thank you in Jesus
[1:37:37] name
[1:37:41] anybody else before we go
[1:37:52] every
[1:37:59] if you're standing for her grandmother
[1:38:00] they got word that there's a possibility
[1:38:03] that the cancer is in her grandmother
[1:38:07] she's been healed before totally
[1:38:10] delivered we believe that they don't
[1:38:12] know yet it's dark
[1:38:15] and so let's just believe it's not there
[1:38:17] and this little one standing for her
[1:38:20] grandmother
[1:38:21] father in the name of Jesus Christ our
[1:38:25] little sister believes you
[1:38:26] she's not listening to me she's talking
[1:38:28] to you and she believes that by your
[1:38:30] stripes her grandmother's healed and we
[1:38:33] believe with her and we thank you for it
[1:38:35] and we'll hear a good report from it all
[1:38:37] is well
[1:38:38] in Jesus name okay anybody else because
[1:38:49] you're dismissed remember the service
