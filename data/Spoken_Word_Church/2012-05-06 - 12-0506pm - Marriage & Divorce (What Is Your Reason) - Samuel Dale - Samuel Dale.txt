========================================

foreign foreign and prepare for this part of the wedding vows renewing remember now the announcements the fellowship meeting will be it for the pageants the third Saturday so remember to do to get everything ready for that but uh we had Robbie and Ruth has requested that they be able to renew their wedding vows and we we think it's a good thing because she Robbie had backlit and gone away and and things and been away from the Lord for quite a while but then he's come back this is their 20th wedding anniversary and I don't know whether it's the day or when it is or Wednesday Wednesday will be their 20th wedding anniversary so we appreciate that that's a good thing right so if they would come up we will go ahead through with the you know doing the wedding vows we won't have to do a whole lot we just want to do enough to uh to make it to where that they will be renewing their vows and the thing and if there's any other couple would like to come up and participate then we invite you to come and do so um because we just leave it open you know and that way we can do it okay I just like to read a scripture because we appreciate it desire and we always use this at a wedding so you know if you would let's just let me just read the scripture and then we'll say a few words and you know then we'll try to go through this part and get through with it all right you find in Genesis we always use this Genesis 2 in verse 20 and Adam gave names to all the cattle into the fall of the iron Trevor Beast to the field but for Adam there was not found and helped me for him and remember it helped me not a mate right I have meat it's a different word Darcy anybody can be a mate when you take someone special to be part of you because that's what that word meek brings together see not m-e-a-t and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the Flesh and stood there up and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh we appreciate that because that's that's what it is and we come to a point of you know to renew their wedding vows so that's a good thing so you know we could have the kids lined up around all of them and make it look good to the world to see them renewing their vows but we really appreciate people being concerned that's right I think it's a good thing to do uh you know to review your vows to to tell one another that you love one another you know on that point you know and all the words should be doing it and that would be great to do okay but let's just do it this way Robbie 20 years you know and a time to think over a lot of things like come on are you go that's it after 20 years you don't have time to bring it over would you marry her the second time yes I would okay that's a good way of putting it on this you know this is not a total wedding of what you call the second time you know but it is a renewing all right that's right let's wait just a minute till the rest gets up here and it'll get the family standing around and that's good okay Robbie do you take this Ruth to be your awfully wedded wife I do Ruth after 20 years do you still love rock um you see to love each other in the Lord then it comes out to be a lot of things don't it so Bruce will you take this Romney to be here awfully with a husband amen so with the power invested in me as the minister of the gospel and not sure the state of Georgia I pronounce you man and wife in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen but God has joined together let not a man try in any way to put it to something okay now you may kiss your brine thank you I'm ready to say but in the 90 days we'll say well you know when I don't know we'll say well we was there amen we was there we were standing there with Mom and Daddy when they was doing renewing their biops and I do I think it's a good thing to do and and all to to tell each other that you love each other and to renew the vowels and the things like that you know and you know I gave a quote there the other day what wrote around and was talking about that you wouldn't marry it in a church you know and uh he said that's all right said you're married they said it ought to be done in a church it should be that way and things like that well see my wife and I wasn't we you know we wouldn't uh she was a good dad just and I was just me and um you know we we just went down to a justice of the peace and her father was with us and and everything to stand there and and do the wedding but you know we're just as married as anybody else has ever been and you know we really haven't went two hours well then you remember back when on 50th with the 50th wedding anniversary we had an opportunity to have our vows renewed and that was good I I thank God for that don't you amen and encourage these to to you know love one another and that's the one thing my brother had a good point that he went to get he was going to get married and they went to this old preacher over here in the country and he thought man that guy don't know nothing you know come out our old overalls on Old Farm or something you know he walked out there and it was getting married you know he's thought man this is something man some old coocher like that doing my wedding you know and he said the old man told and said no Marshall should you remember now I said if you're on one side of the house and you watch on the other side of the house and said you got a rope run across said you just zigzag it said you're not gonna get nowhere said but now Marshall what you do said you just lay down your end of the Rope go around and take a hold of her hand with that rope in her hand and said you know that rope will just fall off the house he said I left thinking that guy had some good scenes yeah you know he knew how it was all about he knew life today amen so we appreciate that man let's stand back up together if you're willing to go to Matthew as we're in our scriptures and and reading in this little Book of Matthew 19. laughs the only father we thank you Lord Jesus for this day and this opportunity thank you Father for the ability to be able to stand here today and renew wedding vows see a couple that wants to live for these especially in order to see them as they've come to you here and they've been with us now for many many years but now coming to serve you and that makes a that makes a family of Art and we ask you to just bless them and be with them and take care of them bless us now as we try to minister your word and just have your way in your loving grace in Jesus name amen amen Matthew 19 verse 3. the Pharisees also came into him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife forever cause and he actually didn't send them to them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this call shall a man leave father and mother and she'll cleave to his wife and they claim she'll be one flesh before there are no more Twain but one flesh but therefore God hath joined together let not man put us under they say unto him why did Moses didn't command to give her writing a divorcement and put her away he saith unto them Moses because of the hardness of your heart suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it wasn't so it was not true and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife accept it be for fornication and shall marry another committee to the adultery and who shall marry her which is put away does commit adultery you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now this is Messi's number eight as I said we'll try to uh we want to take them maybe at least another service or something on it but we'll try this coming Wednesday night to take questions and answers so if you're not going to be here to turn in your questions uh you know do it now and let me know or call me or whatever and we'll try to cover as I said give examples if you want to what about you know what about this what for that give examples and that's fine and that way we can can all come together and and talk about these things I am not your final Authority God is your final Authority so you must answer him for all things as I was saying this morning that um even in the the message that I co kept telling you this is the way I believe which means that um you know and that's the argument that was made for many years you could put away your wife fornication and that was before marriage but after you got married some said you couldn't put her away at all you had to live with her you know as she desired and uh then the others would say well you could put her away but none of them would allow the remarriage after then you know and uh I seek fornication as being one I believe the prophet expressed it to be that fornication and adultery is this same wording and the fornication technically is a girl that you know before she's married yes we understand an adultery is a technical point of being that of a woman that is married but then brother Branham would cover about Adam and Eve as we gave this morning that um she committed adultery all right because they were married and that's what I've emphasized over and over to you that when what is a wedding what is a marriage when the when your boy asked a girl and she accepts that's a marriage all right you break that and go off and marry somebody else you're living an adultery because you've done wrong all right what is a divorce to just take away those finals as I said what country would be in maybe it would have the rules like we have other countries maybe don't have them so you could go before the the king of the tribe or whatever he'd be you know hit man and he'd say well you know you say well this this and then well cast done and you know what they would stick by theirs probably more than what you would get us here to stick by them in America with all the paperwork that's fine you know because it would you know because they honor those things all right but trying to get down to that we know for a certainty that the woman cannot divorce the husband and remarry her husband must be dead Romans 7 we gave where the Prophet said it and we may complete this you know just call him back over to make sure that you understand but the point I wanted to try to get across this morning is one thing see if a woman if a woman we gave the prophet's words the word that a man could put away his wife for committing fornication and marry again all right I think he's free because now here's where you're going to get technical with me it'd be all right except the preacher well now you've got a problem with her because you cannot Rectify all of the quotes together if you take that line of the preacher can't preach because he's got two wives now I'm going with you on one basis if he's got two wives he can't preach right right but if that wife in that situation is taking care of its own self then he's free to marry again and if he's free to marry again then he would be free from the situation and there'll be no problem for him preaching and that's what I tell you I believe that that's the way I believe it so you can go with what you want to but now not for just any kind of demons and that's what we went through if you cause her right if you divorce a woman for any other reason then the the things we gave this morning of a fornication are an adulterous Safari then you wouldn't be free to marry again that's right and you if she married she's going to cause her so you're guilty of causing her trolls so what do you what people wanting to deal with you know they're not listening to the word and reading the word to express the full understanding of what the word says you know how much more guilty would you be for causing somebody to do something right are going doing it yourself right amen come on what would be what's what's much difference in it you you know like I said you could say well okay I got a living husband so I just shoot him man I don't live in Hollywood but I get married but you're a murderer what has that justified anything or what's it done you're guilty see so then keep those things in mind of what I tried to cover this morning see if a man has an illegal right to put away his wife she goes and does something wrong he's not guilty does everybody understand that I understand what I'm saying she's he's not guilty of what because she done it herself she was the one that brought it on all right but he causes her to do that even though you know there may be some problems but he causes her to do then he's guilty of causing her to commit adultery all right now that's what the Bible says and that's what we ought to believe in and try to walk into the light of that other because I mean the truth of it all right we have a scriptural reason then you're not guilty all right now if you say well now I don't know about the marriage well Jesus put away the lutherans and married to methodists see if you hold your line too tight you got it set on one thing one thing Jesus would not be able to marry the Methodist after putting away the Lutheran you understand the uh I'm your pastor and by being that you know if you don't agree with what I'm saying you know that's that's your problem and your situation I tried to make it as long as I could plain is a good to explain everything right because you know you have no reason to divorce a woman a man doesn't except it be for fornication all right then I added for it to be in that fornication be an adultery after marriage and that was I kept telling you this is my opinion because there is not a quote anywhere I've been over 40 something years and not a quote that brother Brown said that a man could put away his wife for committing adultery after they're married and then go on and marry somebody else there's not a quote for that so you say well you're out of the message well okay I could say some things back and say when did you ever get into it but there's no argument you know of of fussing about it I'm just going to tell you what I believe amen and then leave it from that you know to where it is it's left in in anybody else out there listening you're responsible of your people right it's not that I'm not Pastor nobody around the world don't call me and ask you your questions I don't do it but I'm not I'm pastoring here right I answer questions that are here you know and not not anything else all right so if it's the word saving and the word accept is the same word from Matthew 5 32 using the word saving for the cause of fornication Matthew 19 9 saying except means that there is no other reason than the fact of what it says that are for committing fornication right all right then that wouldn't give you you couldn't argue there's no need of coming to me in Oregon all right now we gave you this morning off of conduct order and Doctrine in 1959 paragraph 187 that if a woman marries a man and does not tell him that where she has been wrong in her past before they're married that he has a right to put her away and marry again and on that quote not around and said they were never married in the beginning because they was a false pretense she lied to him see and then he can put her away and marry again now he didn't say the preacher can't do that see that's where people says the preacher can't the point the preacher came is what everybody's supposed to be now preachers supposed to marry a virgin right everybody's supposed to marry birds all right but now that's what we can get into and we've been through it if a woman has been true and married a man and live within 50 years and she was a virgin when she started and they lived 50 years and she he passed it on she can marry again because she in God's eyes still virgin you see that's that's where that we we have to keep everything running in the correct order all right so we gave also from the paragraph 85 invisible Union where wrote around said that they could be married as much as even 10 years and come up and tell it and said then would have a demand would have a legal right to put her away and to marry again and because fornication is what unclean living right unclean living all right now I'll give you this one so let's pull up number 1A I was the notes and we'll start I quoted this this morning and I went back and found it to where we could have it so I want to read it to you I'm going to flashy red lights of this coming 1963 6 23 in the evening now look in in June to sell it chapter again Sodom and gomar on my what an awful thing unmarried to women going after strange flesh a man that's married to his wife they're not no longer to their one and a man now this that'll run out after another woman he automatically separates himself from his wife now that's as much to the man right right all right now watch and a woman that runs out with another man she is dead to her husband watched it she's denied her own flesh she's cut away from him that's right in the day of judgment we'll have to answer for it all right so that's if you want the scripture for it that's in Timothy uh First Timothy 5 and 6 where it says that she's dead boss 11. oh no so then that that puts that part to where we're going to be so now what we want to do this afternoon is cover something else that does sound like as I said there's no cause for divorcement except fornication all right and I want you to remember that's what I'm saying and that's what I believe well then they were saying to Jesus you know it's for any cause and he said it was himself in the beginning in other words he's saying you're not right it wasn't so from the beginning and you know all right then when it come to brother Brown and brought around and said that a man could put away his wife for cutting iron that's right but I've got two quotes where he says it that he cannot marry again just because he's cut her cutting her heart all right so we'll get that out of the way in a minute to start with but I want to get this out of the way and get it plain to you where you'll know what I'm talking about then sisters you should realize the seriousness of your hair amen that is the one specific thing that the Bible approaches about a a woman it sure covers clothes you know address modest to do this that and the other but it really lays upon you cutting your hair all right now I didn't realize the seriousness of that that much until I began studying on this so I want you to see that it would have to be the correct grounds so the prophet in saying that you could put away your wife for cutting her hair that would have to be the same grounds or the same situation as in Matthew 19-9 right or Mark Matthew 5 32 it would be the saving or accept right complete so then we're going to see that for her cutting her hair brings her into a situation of fornication which would not be sexual intercourse I mean but would wind up to be unclean living right now I want your sisters to think seriously about this point and sometimes I know sisters ain't got a bad little habit of reason around and sniffing just a little bit and cutting a little here or Maybe burn off a little dire or something to to try to get everything to working but you're not do that and you ought to realize they're serious of what it means amen you said well brother Dale it don't mean I'm a fornicator well now you're gonna let we're gonna let brother random answer today right amen because that's the seriousness of the matter well that ain't gonna send me the hell cause I cut this little off the ends now now let me say it this way the cutting off the end wouldn't send you to hell I think you think the attitude of thinking you can do it and it'd be no problem which sends you to hell do you understand you understand my statement the thing you've done wouldn't be so bad if the thing that's causing you to do it right when I want to do this I want to do that I want to be and then women will use the excuse I want to be for my husband well that's good it's wonderful but no let's we'll just read some quotes and we're your prophet and how strong he makes it and you'll see why that he spent so much time about a woman cutting her right and I remember to just snip a little is cutting right that's right you know now in the Bible we won't go back and cover it everybody is in yours adults has fallen to message quite a while if you need it we will be glad to go in it in the Old Testament brother Brown said If a woman cut her higher you know for any reason he said now if something goes wrong and she had something had to be cut all right you know a reason maybe it was burned off for a little or maybe you know just anything that happened an accident there he said to shave your head yep and they took her down to the priest and shaved her head and let it grow back out now that was the law we're not exactly like that okay you think we don't have Grace and don't understand but if it was an accident happening and I went in the hospital room and there's half your heart on the savored clean off and you tell brother Dale I don't want to cut my hair I said well we're going to have a problem so you'd say would would you say it would be okay to fix it up with the rest of it yeah because of me that's me okay but if you ask me what the law says I'll tell you what it says right law said shaved it that's right you think that brother devil doesn't have Grace you have a lot more do you think and you think I looked at I told him last night the sister looked at me and she'd never thought that I said I'm a bigger legalist more of a legalist than anybody in this building right I have my own thoughts but if they're just my thoughts I don't bring them out of this Pulpit right I don't deal with my thoughts yeah I could be more legalistic than what you think but I just don't bring it out to try to beat people to death with it now I see something come in that's the way preachers are you know they're reading their texts and it's going to be on the mark of the beast look up now comes a woman then her dress is a little short the message changes and it goes to the dress now you know well I was led to do that now okay all right I'm not your God but most people are led by their eyeballs my brother told one time I'll call his name but he called and he was sitting on the platform in this preacher this is back in there right before they were coming in the message and the preacher walks around and looks and boy he changed his topic these people get on the platform of these two-tone shoes on is he looked up down the aisle and he looked around he was the only one that had on two-tone shoes I told myself to pull mine off and put them in my pocket you know where he could go on with a sermon but okay get that out of the way but now so I want you to understand what I'm saying we're proven this afternoon that for you sisters to trim your hair cut your hair is a sign of fornication which is unclean living not sexual intercourse I mean but how close it's gonna get it that's right my brother around and says she loves somebody else that's a quote we'll read that in a minute that's right he said I'm doing it for my husband I got into it you're a while back trying to explain about things and I always do simple terminology and I was plainly talking to you about the two sisters dress up to go to town but you don't dress up for your husband right I got into trouble with that that's all right all right I stay in trouble with things trying to explain but I'm still right on it why don't you dress up for your husband sometimes like you dress up no time and I thank you all to dress up to go to town that was what I was trying to explain but I misunderstood and then most would say well I don't even know what you're talking about well maybe you don't maybe I don't either but that's mean I think we were to be Christians but I think you're your husband is your husband right he's the closest thing to God you got right and without him or your father you have no history that's why in deuteron are in numbers where which one we've covered in the vows one day a divorced woman has no headship to deny her vows right so they're all counted I gave you that right all right it's a great thing to have a head now like I was saying this morning about the Spanish Hispanic the words from the times here's what it is you sisters you you bless God I won't I want my own thing you ain't gonna tell me what I'm gonna do well then that's right you're not going to tell me what to do that's right but you let it turn around and then you know they get in trouble and then they say my husband will take care of that a quote from Brother Brown that he said if his daughter was dressed wrong he didn't know whether he'd defend her or not would you like that quote see we don't quote at all we quote what we want all right go now be red faces and everything in the world and upset with me without any questions but I'll be glad to cover it but I'm just going to cover the same thing I'm going to cover it over to Wednesday I'll tell you this what do you mean brother Dale that's what I mean the word fornication has to go on into the situation of even eating food and offered to Idols right right right and that fornicator to call him the different things see all right so let's get into it now let's read it but I'm going to read the first two to make sure that somebody out there won't hear it and think I'm saying wrong and then we're going to go through the message all right so let's go with number one now of the message this is in Demon Ali religious realm 1953-609 a paragraph 225. and he's talking about how the women do with their little bitty heart cut like a man posed up you know the Bible says which is a disgrace now what and a woman the Bible claims if a woman cuts her heart a man's got a right to put her way in divorcement listen because she's not honest with him now come on read these yourself when you're thinking I was just blabbering a moment ago to say that it would turn out to be fornication and be some problems with it for your sister to just trim a little and just cut a little and just you know huh he said because she's not honest with it listen we have to get down and preach the Bible here some of these days said if she bogs her hair she dishonors her husband if she's dishonorable she ought to be put away you can't marry another one now that's to the man right but you can put her away boy that's going hard and I can feel it but that's the truth that woman can be put away for cutting her heart but the man can't remarry just because of that ground that's right all right so now if there is no reason as we covered this morning except it be for fornication all right so cutting your highest fornication right now you understand the word I'm standing I've got to make that blunt that's right this fornication for you to cut your heart right because it's unclean living you've got a head your husband your head we're going to read the scripture but we're gonna just look at the next one now both of these are in 1953 and I thank God that they would real early because you can't say change is mine later yeah all right then you're going to say well now brother Dale after the seals broke well we're gonna redact the seals bro okay but here's the two statements so look at what he's saying your questions and answers on Genesis 19 53 729 paragraph 76. he said I had a hot one on that one the other day in Shreveport they was talking about the woman and should women wear long hair and I said a woman that bought her her husband had a right and a Bible right to divorce her that's right that's what the Bible said that's exactly right oh my Holy Ghost women's sitting dire just the way they've been taught me that's all please yes that's Luke Smith and if he said now if they would cut it if there's something wrong they had to cut and they put something wrong had they had to cut their hair said let her take a razor and shave it off and make her higher real slick until it comes out her head that's exactly that's right that's what the scripture said it says if she cuts her higher she dishonors her husband and a woman does dishonorable has a legal right to be put away in divorce but he can't marry again now all right so we're putting that in there to make sure but he but he can put her away in divorcement that's right that's the scripture oh brother what we need is some some question nights that's right that's First Corinthians the 14th which really will get to us the 13th if you want to read it all right now that that now this women all right so let's go to First Corinthians I think I gave it to you to pull up didn't umbrella First Corinthians 11. and I put it on Brother Anderson if not turn in your Bible First Corinthians 11. all right because he says 14 there but I think that he was meaning First Corinthians 11. all right whatever let's go you can read the 14th and might find something but maybe they'll get it up there in a minute because you could turn right over and start uh First Corinthians 11 verse we'll go over verse 2. let's go verse one I love it be your father to the man is all and I also am of Christ another word follow I want to say now what do you say did I follow what Christ says okay man because I am to you Christ is that just point right okay may I Praise You Brethren that you remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as I delivered them to you now keep the ordinances now this is an ordinance to be delivered but what have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the heavier the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God okay we're getting a little there so then we cover the man and the woman verse 4 says every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonoreth his head which is dishonoring Christ all right that's why we don't wear a hat in church we don't come in here and do if I'm up here even working I remove my hat while in here working I'm always trying to do that all right because I don't want that covering but I don't want my hair hanging down because that's really what it's talking about right amen right right no just going to turn around to her to her so a man with her running all down his back and all these long looking hippie things all right amen so then he's dishonorable oh you know what God deals with that the dishonor his hand which is dishonoring cry but every woman that prayers or prophesied with her head uncovered dishonor of her head for that is even all is as if she were shaving okay now women the older women used to wear what some of them still do a hat my mother-in-law would not go to church without a hat on if she would go out in the sun and be out she would be in the rain man I'm not joking but she wouldn't go to church without the Hat on because they believed that but it doesn't say her hat is a covering right right all right she'll read the scripture but every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered now remember tough right well brother Dale my hair who's that lady that sings Crystal Gayle she's got higher long enough to reach from here Jimbo I saw that one day on something now my Lord and she's a worldly person it is I mean he just rolls down on the floor behind I don't know whether she's ever cut it or what I figure she probably does you know to straighten it up to do this that another but my point is it's not how long the higher is some people at higher don't grow long black people's Tire don't grow long right it curled up it don't grow long you know all right now if you see with a woman black woman with long hair there's some whites in their generation somewhere that's plain language that's not going off on nobody it's just in case somebody comes along starts to say something well that already covered that down to longer higher because the hair doesn't grow so it's not how long the hair is see the old saying how long and long okay my definition you take a rope you stretch it out now you don't never cut it no words long right but if you cut one quarter of an inch off it ain't long no more right right because you cut off some of it all right so now sisters if you just trim your hair and I said here your head is uncovered the prophet of God said God won't hear the prayer of a bobcat woman now you argue with him about it you say well I know a lady that's on TV that he right that's a gift right come on that's a gift in her that's a gift that's working that's what other people receiving from the gift your Prophet said it I didn't you need that quote God won't hear the prayer of a bobcat woman well brother I remember when I was cutting my heart and God heard my prayers you better thank God he did amen you shouldn't be upset with me about it to express it in the wrong way you want to say thank God he heard me you ought to cry out and enjoy that he did hear you right because he baptized all the prophets words in the scripture to hear you come on that's good if she prayeth or prophesied we're gonna hit him covered or if the woman be not covered let her be shown but if it'd be a shame for a woman to be sworn or shaven then let her be covered now covered means not how long it is covered means not being cut do you understand it's not a hat if the woman's higher that's not being cut is recovering but if she's trimming the edge she's doing away with her honor and Glory continue I didn't want to preach this message for sure but all right but I like to be nice birth the woman be not covered let her also be showing but it's to be a shame for a woman to be short or shaven let her be covered all right for a man indeed ought to not did not cover his head for as much as he is the image and glory of God but the woman is the glory of the man so what does it mean now the command not can't wear a hat right now if you're dealing with a woman's higher why don't you think you're dealing with a man's higher yep all right a man's higher is is it the fact that he's covering himself with his heart so then that would be wrong yep now I'm sure we'll get into it one of these days because somebody will come here with these turbines on and we'll ask them to remove it and they'll probably refuse to do it and cause a big stake well I've already been to their places and I've done honor to their honor I took my shoes off when I go into the place and I will quickly ask the person can it be that if I come to your place do I got to pull my shoes off yeah think all right looking into it because I'm Satan here sitting you bring it up all right all right but see the woman is the glory of the man a real true life is the greatest thing brother said God could give you outside of Salvation now that's something behind ever a good man is a what a good one because the wind is now in front of every good man yeah I'm changed a little now but you know we're in a different world but look for the man see now watch but the woman is to go to the man for the man is not of the woman that's right hey I had a mama I come from a woman we're not talking about that but who come first that's right Eve was in Adam right Joe it wasn't the man the woman coming first that's what it's saying for a man is not of the woman but but the woman is of the man neither was the Man created for the woman listen but the woman for the man right you realize now come on Brothers all you men that's got wives think about it you know that God taught enough of you to give you a good life amen amen yes sir he gave you a good gift amen right my wife always said to me she said honey you would have been born and you've already been a while you call it a Hermit in the form but not that word but meaning that you know I would not have never got married you know in order to just say to myself and that way I could preach and do things I said but I wouldn't made to be that way I wasn't made to be without a wife of course you didn't understand that I was 18 she was 16. We Got Married pretty quick so that no problem right right but look what it's to say the woman was created for the man why because Adam was lonely yeah God to fellowship with he had all the animals to fellowship with but you're still lonely and you don't run around and said God was lonely and so that's why he created man that's for fellowship and he created a woman to be with Fellowship with her husband not two husbands now you know that's wrong former Fellowship you know that's not exactly right now watch what it's for this call the woman to have power on her head because of the Angels I'm not sure to have power on her head so what she meant in other words you ought to have long hair I was at your glory what was Samson's uh Power right right it was he's higher right it was really in the promise of God but we still know the other card work all right now you ought to have power in other words she ought to honor her head she's made to be a health meat not a master all right now look because of the Angels now run around them there's a quote for this if you'd like it he said goes in churches Messengers are going to blast that thing that's the way he said it when you read that scripture about the cause of the Angels the he said them Church age Messengers are going to blast that right now nevertheless neither is The Man Without The Woman neither the woman without the man and the Lord number one back to what I said this morning man and his wife is a type of Christ in the church not a man and a whole lot of wives that typology ended at Calvary now he's Christ in the church coming down sure and many members which you know what it's just like David was he had a thousand or I remember Solomon one had a thousand but you know what they could neither one of them could have another man and you know they would ever one hit while singer he had a thousand singular wives you know what I mean each one of them and each one of us is an individual in their body of Christ he's my savior you've got to believe he's yours all right now or as a woman is off the man and watch even so is the man also by the woman huh but all things of God nor would we come from a woman we come from the morning with men we come from a woman right look you do it in the right order come on judging yourself is it commonly for a woman to pray unto God uncovered huh does not even nature itself teach you if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him yeah nature is the nature of a man ought to be that he has short hair now short don't have to be shaved heads all right I never said nothing around here about some of you know someone had to say hey you need to get a haircut huh but see he in nature his nature ought to be to be a man yeah and I can't help it I'm sorry now if you think I'm wrong you wouldn't do it and I see you walking around with long hair I'm going to say he's a Tinkerbell that's too old for most of you to know language out there on the internet and around here you plainly means I think he's too close to his feminine side well you know okay that's me all right let's see the woman her hire is her honor and glory amen right man but now let's go back to that Nature Park I like to put natural and spiritual together you know in nature animal shelter all right that's right I'll throw it back right winter time the park is long right stay warm summertime it sheds off it's all natural instrument okay not even nature Chef teach you this a man have a long harass or shame unto him but if a woman had a long hair it is a glory to her I remember long means long means not being cut right don't mean four foot it means not being cut to a man that has higher that's not being cut now don't come up with me or anywhere else around here I think when I wouldn't do it come up and say Jesus had a long hair we brought around and said he had shoulder length higher now you argued the point with brother Branham he said he had shoulder length higher all right you said well Samson had to her I'll agree because here's the statement I've always made if you will men will live the life example of Jesus Christ and let Christ be as he was I mean God be in you like he was in Christ your heart can drag the ground I don't have no problem if you have the Life of Christ right because you know what you're going to do you got the Life of Christ you're gonna make it look presumable and not go around flipping it but if it won't have long hair should glory to her for her hair is giving her or a cover now here's the one a lot of people relay on but if any man seem to be contentious which means arguing debate and fuss we have no such custom now they say that means that there's no custom about the hiring or nothing no that's not what it's saying right I'm not going to argue with you about anything about the haircut or whatever just tell you like it is and leave it alone but if it may seem to be content somebody wants to argue with you all right come on no wait what you are come on all right well do you understand then why her hair being her covering long hire which means uncut now here's a quote they asked brother Brown on something similar to that and there's a quote to these verbatim words this woman quits cutting her hair you could come in here and you could have her short as mine yeah in the day you see that and you say ain't gonna cut it no more do you know that in God your higher is 40 foot long if that's what it needs to be he said that ain't gonna be no short-haired women over on that other side does that mean all the black people's tires got to run down somewhere and uncurl what kind of ceiling this are you uncut yep uncut hair so then the length of it your sisters know it my wife's hair used to be way on down you know it still is long in some points in the middle but she doesn't have the massive heart she used to have one because it's naturally going to break off no and you know yourself I've never beat on to you about it like preachers say that you ought not get a perm put it in your heart I can't read where blood around said that so I just don't say nothing about it but if you're having the perm put in there to make yourself worldly then you need to check yourself that's all they got and all I've ever said to anybody my daughter or anybody if you're doing it you know with my wife she's never had one at least since we've been married but anyhow uh I'm just honest about it put it in the right respect but get the whole point man what's the whole point you're saying brother Dale long hair is hired it's not being cut anything if it's 40 foot long and you cut one inch off it's no longer long right until you're out of the scripture right right okay solve the problem well I need to do this well that's all right you go talk to God about what you need to do now remember we went through though two quotes that he could put her away for cutting her hair but you cannot remarry because of the grounds of her cutting her hair so then you know now to you brothers and things and to the people why would you want to press the issue of divorcing your wife issues an unbeliever did I answer did I say that the way that it went out you know if she's an unbeliever issues an unbeliever she's going to cut her hiring do you want you do you want a divorce are you hunting for a reason to do it right all right please shoot an unbeliever now a woman that is a believer now that's where we get to it you're gonna see that that's purely flag of fornication for a woman that claims to be a Christian because right amen now how else can you say that he's got in the grounds you're going to make brother Brown come on you're going to make brother Brown and say just exactly what he had just got to say that those Pharisees was trying to say that you could put away your wife or any copper well see here it run around and get some cobbles other than an adulterous act you know racial sexual intercourse he gives a call who is evidently looking at something spiritual and bringing it on into the being of the person and connecting the natural and the spiritual together of a wife you know amen and putting it into that place now let's give some quotes from just to see what he has to say okay uh let's see so we gave the two that said that he can put her away but he cannot remarry all right let's go to number three okay and forgive me for reading a bunch we'll try to read as nice as we can and then when I do that I generally miss work so forgive me you read it the worst sinner in the city I remember that one and I remember the meanest man like boy I listened to that Tate and one time it said about the invasion of the U.S man I grabbed that tape the worst centered in the city all right I got 73. let me tell you something a lot of you women tonight would have an awful time doing that and he's just talking about Jesus with the dirty feet you know right and the woman had to wash Jesus his feet with her heart that's what he's explaining just prior to this and watch what he says now awful time in doing that you'd have to stand on your head to do it shame on you the Bible said to her is given to a woman for her glory and the Bible gives rights gives any man a right to leave and divorce his wife and leave her that'll cut her hair that's the Bible you gonna read the rest of that thus saith the Lord right wait a minute now too bad you got away from the old-fashioned training feeling if you'll notice when if you'll check these you'll find out Jesus and not just at the Tabernacle all the time but look what he said he said if that's just saith the Lord it must not have been brought around talking right next one number four life preached in 1958 5 19 paragraph e 46. it's time the church took its position and come out of the things of the world you know what it used to be that it was wrong for a Christian woman in the Holiness groups to wear a short hired what happened I can remember when you couldn't be when you couldn't be taken into the church with short hair I still are strong man he said I remember when you couldn't be taken to the church for sure it was wrong in the first place it's wrong yet the Bible said that if a woman cuts her hair her husband has a right to divorce her and get away from her that's exactly that's exactly right what do you do it for to follow fashion now you're not going to like me after this but at the Judgment bar you're going to find out something the Bible said if a woman cuts her hair she dishonors her head which is her husband and she's a dishonorable person she should be put away it used to be wrong but something happened okay going to the next one it's 1958 Jesus at the door uh 529 paragraph e 36 the Bible claims that the woman cuts her hair or in lock her husband has a right to divorce her and send her away the Bible said so she dishonors her husband and a dishonorable woman shouldn't be lived with all you say I'm just as pure as a Lily that might be true sister it's because the preacher never told you about it or either your stubborn will that wouldn't let God come in maybe it didn't come into the preacher's heart and hit it all right go to the next the mark of the beast 1961-16 paragraph E15 what we need today is men we need gospel preachers and any preacher that will stand in the pulpit and hold back on those stains I got a little respect for him being called of God right a man that's ashamed to stand in the pulpit and tell God's truth when he knows it's an immoral thing are you ready immoral thing for a woman to cut her hair the Bible a man's got a right to leave his wife and give her divorce when you cut your heart the Bible said so who's the head of the woman her husband and the Bible said If a woman cuts her hair she dishonors her head no dishonorable woman should be lived with amen she cuts off her glory and so does the church when she does the same thing she cuts her glory stream off all right so now laying it down immortal dishonest all kind of things okay number seven 1961 520 from that time paragraph East 61. I was speaking this morning of this woman and moral woman watching Jesus's Dirty Feet washing them with wiping them with her some of our Pentecostal sisters have to stand on their head to get enough hair to wash the feet cut it all off see that's right it used to be wrong for you to do that you're still wrong for you to do it the bible plan that teaches a woman cuts her higher her husband has a right to divorce her put her away said as she cuts her higher she dishonors her head her husband and a dishonorable woman should not be lived with I better shut up I'll get you preachers right here I'm only telling you the truth you're going to face me with it at the day of judgment that's thus saith the Lord in his word now we've got two statements on the best day of the Lord okay next one watch the years it just goes up and you say well he changed his Doctrine does he changed it 1963 is your life life worthy of the Gospel paragraph 223 they cut their hair where in the worldly clothes walked out on the street like that and God's Bible warns against it even for the bridge is a woman to even pray with Bob and her and said to the man and she does that she claims herself to her husband and watch she does that now she claims herself to her husband that she's immoral herself and a perfect right to give her a divorce and send her away from him that's exactly right the word of God saying that and a woman hear that and continue to wear short hair and call herself a Christian if that isn't a neurotic what is a neurotic I want somebody to tell me what is a neurotic the whole message that I was talking about in your audience so go look up new rides and find out what it is all right click the next one um I put that one in I think so I've been trying to do it by years but now I put this in okay this is 1956 painting face Jezebel um 1005 I got E4 24. and so we find Jezebel tiring her head which was cutting her hair rolling it up tiring her head every how you say that t-i-r-i-n-g which is a disgrace the woman that cuts her hair dishonors her husband the Bible said so a dishonorable woman should be divorced and put away so that's a sign that she loves somebody else according to the Bible because she dishonors her husband when she does it now who's your lover your husband that is your head her Fashions her world or things he said it's a sign that she loves somebody else right okay go to the next one 1962-17 presuming project 255 and you women that haven't that hasn't the common decency to let your heart grow out like God told you to that's right the Bible said in a woman that above her higher dishonors her head and her that dishonor her husband and you that'll wear these little garments and interested in the world and the Bible goes on go to the next one we're just stand with the heart we're not going to get on the other thing and noise that not 1965 818 paragraph 176 through 179 basically going when you get down through the church and how they're cutting off their hiring the different things and making fun of you or God's word said it's a shame for a woman to cut her hair she will dishonor her head if she dishonors her husband and her husband is the church and the church is Christ she is a dishonorable religious prostitute naked and don't know it naked don't the Bible said the woman's covering is her heart is with the her gift to her for recovery he uses prostitute and naked brother now I don't like this you think I do but is it a trip right amen all right what do we got do we got any more trying to get down right all right yeah choose a little bride 65. right I got 157. and just look what science has done for her she comes out first with her hair chopped off with one of these Jacqueline Kennedy hardoo see or something like that and you know what the Bible said the Bible actually gives a man if he wants to I chose this specifically if he wants to all right the right to put her away in this divorcement if she does that she's a dishonorable woman that'll cut her hair and the Bible said so right didn't know that huh oh yeah I preached too much in California for you not know that that's right oh yeah what good does it do to me they do it anyhow you can't take the pig and change his name make him a lamb you see what he said you can't change the pig you can change his nature he didn't say that you could change his name ain't doing no good he's still a pig change his nature okay I think we got one more marriage and divorce 1965 221 in the morning service paragraph 243 but to get this marriage in divorce straightened out don't you know which was right and which was wrong they plan the shows you're in these types there is one Christ and many members of that wife noticed he can't put us away for Spiritual fornication and false Doctrine now we get onto this later on I'm just putting it in because it's where I wanted it the statement to be made where you remember it anytime he wants to and how dare you to try to put him away and make it the man can put away his wife and marry another one but not the one foot away her husband didn't wear another see all the shadows and tops are perfectly balanced now we have went over and over and over to show he can't put away his wife for just any calls you can't put her away for burning the bread you can't do this it's got to be something related to fornication so then when a woman cuts her higher knowing that it should not be done now we've covered that a man married to an unbeliever who shouldn't expect her to be any different right I mean he should realize today she's going to do these things and a woman that claims to be a Christian he said in our Holy Ghost women didn't know because it hadn't been told all right now you may argue from now on or you may have argued before but I could this message is done we just read if you want to go through it we just read that a woman cutting her hair is immoral she's a prostitute she is a dishonorable she is a fornicator yes right he's covered a lot of things that hides together with your hair right go see Church Sisters people out there listening if we're Christians we're not supposed to argue about whether what something is right or wrong amen we should believe it and walk on well it don't make no difference I'm gonna cut my heart bless God they Ain't Gonna Keep Me Out of Heaven it won't keep you out of heaven for cutting your heart that's right it'll keep you out of Heaven the attitude you had when you just made that statement do you understand right amen nothing wrong to be wrong right it's wrong to stay wrong that's right that's it right no problem with being wrong we're all been wrong but when we stay wrong right now we got a problem you see somebody arguing and fussing about because that you showed the truth then you know who's wrong I knew you would have always preached wrong for a woman to cut her hair but I never tied it together with the fact of him kindness together with it fornication right because the only grounds for a man to put away his life is what did she commit fornication the only thing that he says the difference about the fornication of a natural point and the fornication of women cutting their hair is that for cutting your higher the man can put her away but he cannot marry because of her doing that that's right so why would you want to go do those things right pray for your wife yeah but now I do agree with one thing I mean that little while she gets up her heels bud and she tells you bless God you won't tell me we just won't go back a little no more yeah on the internet we just won't listen no more brother Joe gave me a report there a while ago that covers the cost of our internet system for one year not counting all the workers do for one year is 2441 dollars that we're putting out every year to try to send the message to someone else so you know they're out there on the internet we hadn't asked you for a dime never ask you for nothing that you take what we've said and see whether it's a profits message or not I've got a quote that I didn't bring but I saw one this morning I was looking and rode around and said well my pastor he said if you're a pastor don't agree with the word get real get away from me right please that's what you say man well brother Dale you're trying to bust up churches no no don't have to worry about it because if we bust up any and they feel us full we got to build on glad you're coming you know glad you're coming but we're already talking about having to build on all right that's fine but we're gonna put out seats before we build on we may have some winter units to cover this hidden system sometimes but you know we're not going to jump into a whole lot until we get everything needful all right amen the church why wouldn't we as men want to do what God says anymore right why wouldn't we wanna sister why wouldn't you want to do what God says and say you're a Christian just remember especially your sisters it doesn't show up in men because we're just men you know now come on that's why I really don't like it you go out here and somebody goes riding by and they say well brother Dale we saw a bunch of long-haired men out there they're going to ask you why you'd you don't believe in that do you know and they go finally see a win some women you know when they say shorts and talk well you don't believe in that dude but no I don't believe me well they was out there in front of your charger well we try out with Grace we try to understand first time a sister comes in wearing pants we don't get on to her my defense is instructed not to say nothing give them a little time and they've had them to come here that some of this even setting years come here they didn't know it was wrong to wear pants but after a while you find out and then you could do anything that's good that's Grace well why wouldn't we want to serve God amen and remember now sisters it was your fault we're not we're not gloating hollering and screaming is your fault but I also say it's the man's fault if he lets his wife run him around right right that's right in order amen now what is the ground on what you call that see most men wouldn't agree with the way me and my wife do it but I think that's all right that's me and my wife she pays the beetle she takes care of everything I don't know what's in the bank but I know the bills are paid because I get to matter if the letters is the post talk I mean you know when the mailbox I know what's going on and all that but people would say well your wife runs your business okay okay if I tell her too sure saved me a lot of trouble and she's a cash the Elder don't understand it they actually are known for safety we tried to instill that to the kids but the problem was they got the Dale they missed the cash so now all the kids is going to Rams Dave Ramsey to learn how to save money when if they didn't listen to their mother the whole time they would have been sitting in Tip-Top shape right today but that's right amen and like I told Brothers Gerald Hughes kind of comical at least we talked about something that somebody brought up and I said well you know I'm even paying for the people to go to this Dave Ramsey you paying for artists you haven't pay them for these people to go for the day for him did he take a course he said you know I'm kind of shocking to him you know I said you don't understand I said if all these people that goes to Dave Ramsey learns how to handle money and they learn how to save it and make it I get 10 percent it's a pretty good investment he said you're a wise man you know no that's being a Christian if I can't we be just that's right men be men and women be women that's right I made that statement many years ago and was ridiculed I said when the men act like men and women act like we'll be closer to adoption than you think the brother went off and told his brother Dale believe he's living right be in adoption I didn't say that I said what I meant we'd be closer yeah okay do the right way that's right that would be understanding I'm not picking on women just because of that because remember we're all feminist in the body of Christ so what is said about the women that also said about the men comes their feminist in the body of Christ amen why don't we want to live and do right in God is it a hard thing that's right but one live right on the brink you know from the edge of the fence you know you want to sit right there and one live right there and sisters just dress wrong you know around and go and doing and cutting your hair or something why you want to live right on that edge that's what I told you and you know it's true even you girls you live good and honorable lives at school oh yeah you think everybody there makes fun of you but you watch who the boys come to when they want to pick a wife that's right and you watch who the girls come to that needs help in their lives they'll come to you first that's right they'll come to you first because they know what it is and the world knows what it is but what are we doing okay on these things hard title I guess I never could get it down just exactly right what even to call it but we just called it the fact of knowing the truth and wouldn't walk in it this afternoon we're gonna have it next Sunday because we were having the the wedding vows and I didn't know I thought maybe we might be did many more might go through what Joy just you know excited we did to go over the next week after the children you got another week of practice because it's going to put your singing over and over next week and uh if we can all get a hold of brother Chris and twist his arm and break his neck maybe he'll sing for him yeah we can't break anymore I've even told him I said we'll let you sit behind the pool here where nobody can see you we're not doing we we want to do it to everybody but we've heard he's got a good voice we heard he had a good playing hand and found that out right right so we encourage all of you to use your gifts for God that's right you know not out there going to Nashville and you know you know things use your gift for God it's a wonderful thing right amen what do we got oh hell it's their birthday Savannah birthday for years don't breathe today be careful you
