[16:19] what us sinners being dead and
[16:21] trespassing sin
[16:23] God who is rich in Mercy
[16:27] he brought you here
[16:29] he calls you
[16:31] you answered
[16:34] what a mighty God we serve
[16:37] what a person that we can is the Bible
[16:39] as we were saying the song There we know
[16:41] the Creator
[16:43] we know the master of the Winds not
[16:44] Solomon hearsay it's not somebody I got
[16:46] to go to a a priest again or or a pope
[16:49] or a bishop no I can talk to him I
[16:52] called Tim this morning I hope y'all
[16:53] didn't too and man I already talked to
[16:55] him if y'all ain't talked to him you
[16:56] need to talk to him before we get
[16:57] started because somebody else has
[16:58] probably been talking to you between
[17:00] that time
[17:01] hello
[17:03] you're either gonna get two voices
[17:06] well maybe three maybe you get yours in
[17:08] every once in a while but the devil's
[17:10] gonna get his then but let's let God
[17:11] have his perfect will today and let it
[17:14] be as the song says well
[17:16] with My Soul think about that song so
[17:19] much about how that man went through so
[17:22] much trial and tribulation we think we
[17:24] went through a lot
[17:25] he lost almost his whole family drowned
[17:28] in the sea
[17:30] and when he went right through the same
[17:31] place the captain said right here's
[17:34] right here is where you where the
[17:36] Shipwreck was
[17:37] and he looks up in these pins the song
[17:40] it is well
[17:44] when peace like a river
[17:47] when Sorrows like what sees Bellows roll
[17:51] whatever my light
[17:55] it is well
[17:57] with My Soul
[17:58] it don't it's not gonna be well with
[18:00] your body all the time it's not going to
[18:02] be well with your spirit all the time
[18:03] but we pray to God that it today you are
[18:05] settled that it's well in your soul
[18:08] and when it's well in your soul it will
[18:10] I promise work its way out

[24:10] the brother to add to the three thousand
[24:12] dollars
[24:13] for the um uh you know you can you can
[24:17] imagine we and I know sometimes we get
[24:19] cramped here but could you imagine
[24:21] living in a house
[24:24] that your church used the bathroom your
[24:26] church used the bedroom for the study
[24:29] for the pastor you you you use your own
[24:32] kitchen for the kitchen like downstairs
[24:34] if we all live downstairs could you
[24:35] imagine all that it's it's kind of rough
[24:38] and it's rough on equipment it's rough
[24:41] on families for privacy and everything
[24:43] so
[24:44] that's why brother Louise said she was
[24:47] showing those pictures that there's a
[24:49] need to build an outside kitchen and a
[24:51] restroom for them to uh to facilitate
[24:54] the church that they're going to and we
[24:55] sure appreciate the Lord for allowing us
[24:58] to be able to help so let's bow our
[24:59] heads I think that's all we got today

[26:09] finish with Temperance and start on
[26:11] patience in the beginning was the word
[26:13] where it was with God and the Word was
[26:14] God and the Word was made flesh and
[26:16] dwelt among us and we beheld his glory
[26:18] the glory of the only begotten of the
[26:20] father full of grace and truth that's
[26:21] what we're focusing on his glory and his
[26:24] honor because he's going to what he's
[26:26] going to take that honor and do what
[26:28] with it give it to us
[26:29] he's gonna give that honor brother Brown
[26:31] said we are his victory in other words
[26:33] we are his glory we are his crown
[26:35] there's not physical crowns are okay but
[26:38] but the crowning Glory of Jesus Christ
[26:40] is his bride yes all right so let's read
[26:42] second Peter 1 verse 5 and says beside
[26:44] this give me diligence add to your faith
[26:46] virtue now we've been through all these
[26:48] to Virtue knowledge we talk about
[26:49] knowledge just for a second the
[26:52] knowledge Temperance the temperance
[26:54] patience and the patience godliness in
[26:56] Luke 21 verse 19. the Bible says in your
[26:59] patience possess ye
[27:01] your souls let's be seated in the Lord
[27:04] has blessing to the reading of the word
[27:06] now remember we've been talking that
[27:09] that God has a plan and a purpose in
[27:11] Christ the mystery God revealed brother
[27:12] Brown said see God had a plan and a
[27:14] purpose his plan and purpose was to get
[27:16] us back to the original amen get us back
[27:19] to the Garden of Eden that's the only
[27:20] time we want to go back we want to go
[27:22] back to that Garden of Eden condition
[27:24] all right before the fall So the plan
[27:26] was and he knew what was going to happen
[27:28] to man so he formed a plan to bring us
[27:32] back all right and he knew though that
[27:34] man had to be part of the plan that he
[27:36] put man on free moral agency so here's
[27:38] man out here amen he knew man would fall
[27:41] he knew we would do what we did he knew
[27:42] what would happen in the Garden of Eden
[27:44] my man so he had a plan already in his
[27:48] mind and a purpose what so that he could
[27:51] display his attributes of Savior and
[27:53] heal and Redeemer all the different
[27:55] things that we as we were I was singing
[27:57] we were all singing just a few minutes
[27:58] ago I mean that's the Adoration our
[28:01] voice to God is the Adoration that we
[28:04] give to the Lord because behind those
[28:06] songs and I actually was looking up who
[28:09] wrote these songs and Bill Gaither wrote
[28:11] one he touched me and and I think one of
[28:14] the hemp Hills wrote the other song and
[28:15] then you got Horatio spafford wrote
[28:17] there's always something behind a song
[28:19] and it's an inspiration that God gives
[28:22] these people that's why I've told him
[28:24] many times before that sometimes you
[28:26] look at these contemporary songs and you
[28:28] really don't care about the listen to
[28:30] the person that sings it but if you take
[28:32] your inspiration you take your anointing
[28:34] that you have and put it with those
[28:36] words and it doesn't sound like a rock
[28:39] concert then everything's fine because
[28:40] the words are inspired listen God's word
[28:44] is inspired there's an inspired voice
[28:47] speaking to me and you today and it's
[28:50] the plan that he's got
[28:52] that we don't have to go through 40 or
[28:54] 50 books one what
[28:56] one book right and then as we've been
[29:00] saying many times before then what we
[29:02] have to do is as God has made this a
[29:05] method of achieving an end well that's
[29:06] what a plan means or a detailed
[29:09] formulation of a program of action
[29:10] there's no other program can't change it
[29:13] won't change it there's not a middle of
[29:14] the road uh oops or or at the in the
[29:18] middle of the football game we got to
[29:19] change everything that's not what we're
[29:21] the word of God word of God's true can't
[29:23] change he can't change his mind he
[29:25] already knew what was going to happen
[29:27] and he formulated this plan the problem
[29:29] is is we got into sin and sin did what
[29:32] sin clouded up the picture it made it
[29:35] where we couldn't get to God we had to
[29:37] we had to get somebody to go into the
[29:39] holy of holies and take our confession
[29:41] to to a god that was an Angry God a God
[29:45] that that if you looked in the Old
[29:47] Testament like brother Ryan said he
[29:48] always thought God hated me or Jehovah
[29:50] hated me and Jesus loved me come to find
[29:52] out the same person what he had done was
[29:54] he had moved from this form to this form
[29:56] over here but the blood of bulls and
[29:57] goats could only cover sin where it
[29:59] eradicated sin on this side and to
[30:01] eradicate sin means how how many of us
[30:03] would love today to have all of our
[30:05] thoughts that we had all of our negative
[30:08] and I'm going to just say it evil
[30:10] thoughts
[30:11] yeah today just erased
[30:14] oh hallelujah oh wouldn't that make it
[30:17] much better for Eva for tomorrow yeah be
[30:19] here for tomorrow if I could just forget
[30:21] everything I did from their back well
[30:23] guess what there's one person that did
[30:25] and he's still doing it
[30:28] and that's God Almighty and so what
[30:31] we're going to do is is we're going to
[30:32] trust his plan and not try to figure out
[30:34] one ourself
[30:36] because man has tried to get into this
[30:38] door and that door but listen there was
[30:40] one door what one door into that holy of
[30:43] holies not a side door not a back door
[30:45] there was one door and you had to go
[30:48] through that door so who is our door
[30:49] Jesus Christ is that door he's the way
[30:52] the truth and the life he is the door
[30:54] keeper
[30:55] and that's what we got to go through so
[30:57] he's give us then this plan and he's
[31:01] given us an option to be born again
[31:06] three more agencies give you an option
[31:08] to be born again or whether you do or
[31:10] don't it's your choice
[31:11] and then as we get into that plan though
[31:14] it's not just that that plan stopped
[31:18] no that's just the beginning of the plan
[31:21] then we as we as we grow up and God we
[31:24] look back and yeah we see that we
[31:25] started somewhere
[31:27] foreign
[31:28] but in our journey
[31:30] the Bible says like impatience possess
[31:32] ye your souls and we'll read a quote
[31:34] with brother Brown and I've seen it just
[31:36] in my short time and I know brother Dale
[31:38] has different ones that you see these
[31:40] people that are on fire for God it's
[31:42] like burning the candle at both ends or
[31:44] brother around set a house on fire on
[31:46] the wind today they just come in and
[31:47] they absolutely just love it they sit on
[31:50] the front row this is the greatest thing
[31:52] it ever was
[31:54] six months later they disappear
[31:56] well they didn't get the right
[31:58] to writing with I'd rather have somebody
[31:59] sit around
[32:05] sit right bug eyed
[32:07] close-eyed
[32:11] I fit that in there didn't I
[32:14] then for you to say this is it I've got
[32:16] it all and then
[32:18] never see you again
[32:19] right that's not part of the plan of God
[32:23] that's part of the plan that he knew was
[32:25] going to take place over here I'm
[32:28] talking about the place I want to be
[32:30] it's that part right there where it says
[32:32] add
[32:34] if I'm born again I must add God to me
[32:39] I'm not adding me to God I'm adding God
[32:41] to me
[32:42] right I want God to come and me be like
[32:45] God and myself I can't go to God because
[32:49] that priest went behind the veil when he
[32:51] come back out he was even a sinner
[32:56] the only thing special about him do you
[32:57] know the answer the only special about
[32:59] him was his lineage
[33:02] it's lineage that's all how he was born
[33:04] he was born in the levite Lenny so he
[33:07] you know of course he had to go through
[33:08] certain things but but he was a high
[33:10] priest not because of his good works and
[33:12] not because of his good looks and not
[33:14] because of Any lap he was a high priest
[33:16] because of lineage well guess what
[33:18] you and I are the same way we're High
[33:21] priests because of the lineage of
[33:22] almighty God not of the Linens in here
[33:25] down here on the earth so that's why we
[33:27] can be high priests going boldly to the
[33:29] throne of grace but remember we can go
[33:31] to that Throne because being Sinners
[33:33] though we can't go any further without
[33:35] God
[33:37] right
[33:38] so God the Lord Jesus that's why I said
[33:40] the other day we got to take our we got
[33:43] to take our our needs and all of our
[33:45] things that we need we take them to
[33:46] Jesus and we give them to him and he
[33:48] gives them to the father now that's not
[33:50] two or three different people that's an
[33:52] act of a play that's part of the plan
[33:55] father protect them Father father
[33:58] amen and his brother Brandon was always
[34:00] his illustration you know he said he
[34:02] said you know the the Corporal body of
[34:05] Jesus is laying on an altar somewhere
[34:08] it's not laying there like this
[34:11] it has come to a place to where we see
[34:14] that that that altar is him himself not
[34:17] just him sitting on an altar or laying
[34:20] on an altar remember in in Revelations 5
[34:23] he was a bloody lamb but he wasn't
[34:25] laying on an altar he was standing up
[34:26] and he had a book in his hand he had
[34:29] conquered something and he said give me
[34:32] that book
[34:33] and he took the book
[34:35] and he opened
[34:37] the book of redemption to me and you
[34:41] but so impatience be patient as we've
[34:44] said many times before we get this from
[34:46] from Dave Ramsey he was talking about
[34:48] you know your financial uh information
[34:51] and all your financial things should be
[34:53] a crock pot it should not be a microwave
[34:56] it's not there's no get rich quick
[34:58] scheme so listen there's no get rich
[35:00] quick quick and God either
[35:02] it's a plan
[35:04] it's got something but you know why it's
[35:05] a plan you said well why
[35:07] that's what he told us we were going to
[35:09] have to go through
[35:11] every step has to be purposed by God to
[35:15] add to your new birth to add to what you
[35:19] previously didn't have before
[35:21] everybody with me
[35:24] add that word means minister or nourish
[35:26] and then we're talking about the word of
[35:28] God we were
[35:30] we were having dinner with Lily and Zach
[35:32] last night and
[35:34] they stay up kind of late kept us old
[35:36] people up
[35:37] but we were at their house
[35:40] so anyhow they they
[35:43] want us to leave
[35:46] Liz said honey we need to be quiet so
[35:48] they can go home
[35:53] everything you can have all the other
[35:56] career and you have the job you can have
[35:58] the greatest this and the greatest but
[36:00] without the unadulterated word of God a
[36:02] place to go to church a place to go to
[36:05] put your not your name on a book
[36:08] but to see your name on a book amen not
[36:11] to put your name on the book but to see
[36:13] that it's already written there
[36:15] praise the Lord so what's the most
[36:18] important thing the word of God put God
[36:19] first
[36:21] and then all these other things will
[36:22] take care of itself because as human
[36:24] beings
[36:25] there's certain things we don't like
[36:29] I like to hunt
[36:30] Michael probably wouldn't care less
[36:32] about going deer hunting getting up in
[36:34] the morning going hunting but that don't
[36:35] make him any less Christian than I am
[36:38] don't make him any less a man than we
[36:40] are we just got to forget all this up
[36:42] and down and that's what's going to
[36:43] happen when we get up to Godliness and
[36:45] brotherly kindness everything is going
[36:47] to have to even out there can't be
[36:51] this because that's what happens when
[36:54] you come to the outer Court remember
[36:56] brother Brown explains that is in
[36:58] justification he said you're standing in
[36:59] the outer Court when it rains you get
[37:01] wet
[37:02] because there's nothing to cover you so
[37:04] you have good days and bad days you have
[37:06] days that looks like that out there
[37:08] amen then you have days that are sunny
[37:11] but but thank God for a prophet that
[37:13] filled in the lines in the love letter
[37:14] that says that that God says I don't
[37:18] hate you on the day that it's cloudy and
[37:20] love you on the day that is pretty
[37:23] time
[37:25] but you gotta believe that
[37:28] well God don't like me now listen
[37:31] I've done told you before
[37:33] God can't change his mind if he ever
[37:36] loved you and gave you the new birth he
[37:37] can't go backwards praise God listen we
[37:41] can for we can either forget or decide
[37:44] to go in a different direction God can't
[37:45] do either one now he can forget your
[37:47] sins but he can't forget you
[37:50] that's right everybody with me so watch
[37:52] the fourth part of this whole thing
[37:53] that's the word of God that's the thing
[37:55] that drives it sure justification is
[37:57] part of the word sanctification you have
[37:58] to hear the word the baptism Holy Ghost
[38:00] is the word of God but it's in a stage
[38:03] remember we're talking about the the
[38:04] ankles to the water and the water up to
[38:07] the knees and water up to the loins
[38:08] which is life but then he took him right
[38:11] back on the on the bank again
[38:15] and trees started growing life came
[38:17] that's what brother Brown always says
[38:19] he's talking about justification baptism
[38:21] Holy Ghost typing your new birth but
[38:23] then he brings number four in and he
[38:25] says the word
[38:27] in other words what is the word the
[38:29] words what you grow thereby you know
[38:30] what the word in what the Bible says
[38:32] that you may grow thereby so what are we
[38:35] talking about today growth
[38:36] yes yes now talk about being born again
[38:38] we're talking about growth if you're not
[38:40] born again we're talking to you but if
[38:42] you're not born if you're born again bro
[38:44] right grow up in God
[38:50] what is it remember oh back to the
[38:52] confession remember and it's a great
[38:54] point that God can never
[38:58] he can never anoint or take a negative
[39:01] confession from you
[39:03] let me tell you something he don't know
[39:05] what to do with it
[39:10] there's nowhere in the Bible for it
[39:11] there's nowhere in the plan for a
[39:14] negative confession it's like what are
[39:16] you talking about
[39:17] what are you talking about
[39:20] no he's talking about me and you growing
[39:23] up listen
[39:25] the Bible tells us to come boldly before
[39:27] the throne of grace now does it tell you
[39:29] to stay there
[39:31] no you gotta come out amen and do what
[39:35] live what was in there what was the
[39:37] problem with the high priest he couldn't
[39:38] live it because it wasn't in him
[39:40] it was temporary he could go get an
[39:43] anointing he'd come back anointing off
[39:45] of Moses could he get anointed speak
[39:47] just as God had to put a veil over his
[39:49] face but when that Veil lifted off he
[39:52] smoked a rock instead of spoke to it he
[39:54] killed an Egyptian
[39:56] right
[39:58] I want to do that one day we'll go
[39:59] through our lineage
[40:01] and show all these people that we are
[40:02] that we preach about all the time and we
[40:05] we Revere these people but
[40:08] Noah was drunk
[40:12] Abraham laughed at God
[40:15] couldn't believe it 75 you had to wait a
[40:17] little 99
[40:20] Moses was a murderer
[40:24] David
[40:25] murder and adulterer
[40:28] Ruth came from an incestuous city right
[40:32] where incest started the moabites
[40:36] Rahab was a harlot
[40:41] but that's what that's who God's Own
[40:44] don't work on the others he works on me
[40:46] and you
[40:47] know the ones that came through the fire
[40:49] and through the flood and through all
[40:50] the different things because we have a
[40:52] testimony
[40:54] when we have a testimony service in
[40:56] heaven that's why the angels are going
[40:57] to have to shut up and be quiet they
[40:59] have no testimony they never went
[41:00] through a test
[41:02] but you and I went through tests so we
[41:04] will have a place for our testimony
[41:07] now watch this brother Brown said the
[41:09] Holy Ghost Bunch being honed out that's
[41:11] what was happening now we're being honed
[41:13] and trimmed out listen as we were
[41:15] talking about the Masterpiece uh several
[41:17] years ago uh and brother Brown said the
[41:20] flaw was when Michelangelo Struck it you
[41:22] got to remember though that when
[41:24] Michelangelo Angelo begin that
[41:27] process of carving or everywhere you
[41:30] want to call it making the sculpture
[41:32] that sculpture was already in there
[41:35] right it was already there it was inside
[41:38] that big old block of granite it just
[41:41] took a master builder to catch the mind
[41:43] of God to see what's in there and he
[41:46] just started chipping away well that's
[41:47] what God did with us he'd start chipping
[41:49] away that's why I said it's not it is a
[41:51] crock pot not a microwave all right it's
[41:55] a moving on we've been 60 something
[41:56] years since the prophet's been here the
[41:59] word of God started in 1947 for us to be
[42:01] able to listen to if we make it to 2027
[42:04] how many years is that yeah
[42:07] that's a lot for us to catch what one
[42:10] man said
[42:11] one man but one man said it's a lot for
[42:15] us to catch
[42:16] but we'll do it because God what God
[42:18] promised it it's part of the plan
[42:21] like I said before ever been to this
[42:23] anything according to sin has an
[42:25] expiration date so you don't have to
[42:26] worry about that you don't have to worry
[42:28] about those things it will expire
[42:30] there will be a time where it will be
[42:32] well with your soul all the time and you
[42:33] won't have to worry about your soul will
[42:34] be in so contact with everything else
[42:36] and that's what we're doing now because
[42:38] I believe our soul is eternal by the new
[42:41] birth it is that Creator it is the
[42:44] master of the wind it is those
[42:46] virtues it is those things it is Jesus
[42:49] Christ it's not a second person it is
[42:51] him but we have so encapsulated it with
[42:54] our spirit realm because of our carnal
[42:56] mind and because of how we came up not
[42:58] because of our parents but how we came
[43:00] up
[43:01] right how we came up
[43:03] and we what we were fed and got fed and
[43:06] fed on ourselves it's it's like brother
[43:08] Robert says about Adam Adam was this
[43:10] great controller he had control over
[43:12] everything right
[43:14] move stuff make a mountain range go over
[43:17] this way just by his voice Brothers
[43:19] after the false it is his his brain or
[43:22] his or his his mind got cloudy
[43:25] and that's our problem my mind gets
[43:27] cloudy
[43:28] it clouds up with all these things of
[43:30] the world that's why I said if we could
[43:32] just forget from this day back it would
[43:34] unCloud a lot and guess what that's
[43:36] what's going to happen when we come to a
[43:38] body change it's not going to just be
[43:39] that your body's changed it's not going
[43:41] to be that your joints won't hurt and
[43:43] you're not stooped over
[43:44] your mind is going to be renewed your
[43:47] mind is going to be changed the former
[43:50] things will pass away behold all things
[43:52] will become new
[43:54] so look brother promise this is a
[43:57] promise to us the Holy Ghost Bunch being
[43:59] honed out so that it can what fit with
[44:01] the same kind of ministry he had when he
[44:02] went away that when he comes back it'll
[44:05] catch the whole thing in the Rapture
[44:06] where the Justified Sanctified the
[44:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost that pyramid
[44:10] will stand again it is today the house
[44:12] of God will live again it is today the
[44:15] tree of life is growing again you and I
[44:18] are that tree of life on the Earth today
[44:20] all right
[44:21] brother Robin Christianity versus
[44:23] idolatry he said we are made partakers
[44:25] of his Holiness we In His Image we are
[44:28] living images of a living God Amen then
[44:31] death to self raised with him now listen
[44:33] his word made flesh again in us oh
[44:38] brother Neville look what is it not the
[44:40] mythical imaginary God sitting out there
[44:43] but the Living God who is the Living God
[44:45] the word but not just the word this
[44:48] right here is dead
[44:49] the letter Kelly
[44:52] but that attached to this makes life
[44:57] the word in you makes itself real glory
[45:00] to God oh I know you think I'm a Holy
[45:02] Roller maybe I am but oh brother did you
[45:04] see it triumph over every denomination
[45:06] all paganism he ain't talking about out
[45:08] there somebody in US
[45:10] amen amen a living God made manifest in
[45:13] a living Temple and the word of God
[45:15] which is God is made flesh in you you're
[45:18] seated in Heavenly places triumph over
[45:21] all things in Christ Jesus
[45:26] we need to uh
[45:28] we need to go back and read
[45:31] um talk about brother Bob who's talking
[45:32] about
[45:33] um spoken words reading the seed
[45:35] overcome
[45:37] because Overcomers don't think it's
[45:38] going to win in this time
[45:40] [Music]
[45:41] because remember you get all this up
[45:43] here in the Book of Revelations you know
[45:46] it comes to this come but right at the
[45:47] very end he said he didn't overcome it
[45:49] this is what I'll give you he's an
[45:51] overcoming this is what I'll give you
[45:53] all right so to me that's a direct
[45:55] mandate that if you overcome this is
[45:56] what God's got to give you he has to
[45:59] give that to you because he can't go
[46:00] against his word all right
[46:03] because that's what we're talking about
[46:04] now the the nature of God and then the
[46:07] Sixth Seal is open and me and you down
[46:08] here on the earth and we'll get into
[46:10] that a little bit later I want to kind
[46:12] of break this just a real quick overview
[46:14] of that maybe if we do it today
[46:17] they owned a oh uncover and open it well
[46:20] that he's talking about two prophets but
[46:21] you and I are prophetic people you and I
[46:24] are going to have to master our nature
[46:27] amen amen you and I are going to have to
[46:30] as the two prophets stand in master
[46:33] Nature by the same Holy Ghost you got
[46:35] inside of you today we've got to master
[46:38] this guy first then we will Master the
[46:41] wind then we've already seen that the
[46:43] third polls happen in this church
[46:44] several several times through many
[46:46] people things have been called and come
[46:48] back storms have been spoken out of this
[46:49] as gas has been put in the gas tank
[46:51] pocketbook that nobody knows where in
[46:54] the world that came back
[46:55] Keys have come back
[46:58] well you so that ain't nothing yeah well
[47:00] yeah it is
[47:01] well that's God the devil's not going to
[47:03] do that he's going he's the one that
[47:04] made you lose them
[47:06] he's the one that made you not look at
[47:08] the gas tank until it got empty
[47:12] but what's calling us folks deep yes
[47:16] what's in here
[47:18] it's what's calling and if you call for
[47:21] Lord I want to be
[47:23] I want to be that I want to be virtue I
[47:27] want to be knowledge I want to be
[47:28] Temperance then if there's a d if there
[47:30] is a deep now if you just go through
[47:31] life numbers I'll get out
[47:33] then you're not going to get anything
[47:36] you got to have a deed that calls
[47:38] brother Brown had a deed that called to
[47:40] him to do things that no normal people
[47:42] would do because what happened with that
[47:44] deep call when he had a prayer line
[47:47] brother Brown didn't know these people
[47:48] that's right that's right he didn't know
[47:50] what was going on but the Holy Ghost
[47:51] Inside of him did
[47:54] it so that Holy Ghost took over and that
[47:56] deep comes out and that deep said you're
[47:59] so-and-so from a so-and-so town you come
[48:00] from a place that that you know it's got
[48:02] a lot of rocks and then you were seeing
[48:04] a doctor that had glasses on and a blue
[48:06] shirt boy I mean that was a vivid if it
[48:09] was an imagination it was a good one but
[48:12] it wasn't an imagination it was the mind
[48:14] of God from that deep call where brother
[48:16] Brown says I just get out of the way and
[48:18] let him take over
[48:20] that's what I hope that we do is we
[48:22] stand here as we sing songs that we just
[48:24] get out of the way and let God Speak
[48:26] before there can be a deep call though
[48:28] there has to be a deep response so in
[48:30] other words
[48:31] God saw what we'd want so he put it
[48:33] already here he's not developing that
[48:35] plan he's got to play already right here
[48:37] waiting on us he's got it in the word of
[48:39] God it's already waiting on us when we
[48:41] come through our journey till we come to
[48:43] the place to where uh it's like brother
[48:46] Joe we were talking about just a little
[48:47] bit ago
[48:49] about Revelation and I remember there's
[48:52] no more prevailing power but a
[48:53] revelation so brother Joe he's they're
[48:55] they're talking about you know the
[48:56] different levels of their archery and it
[48:59] became revealed to him that there was a
[49:00] a different way or another way to get to
[49:03] some of the things they're getting to he
[49:04] said it was a revelation well it's been
[49:06] there the whole time
[49:09] then people just didn't start shooting
[49:10] in in triple SA or USA and then NSA over
[49:14] here
[49:15] it just developed no they've been there
[49:17] the whole time
[49:18] the Revelation or the or the the
[49:20] quickening is just what comes to me and
[49:22] you it the quickening is just what comes
[49:25] to me and you it quickens and we say oh
[49:27] that's what it is see that's the plan of
[49:29] God because sometimes we do get a little
[49:32] cloudy we do get a little foggy in our
[49:35] Revelation but when that collab breaks
[49:37] back and we see what God's already
[49:38] saying how many times have you read the
[49:40] Bible
[49:44] there's a day you look and say
[49:47] did they had that
[49:50] they get a different book
[49:54] message you sit there read a message and
[49:56] you read it and you and somebody comes
[49:58] back and quotes out of it and you said
[49:59] man that pace must have been stuck
[50:01] together I don't believe him no you read
[50:03] it it's just that your mind was foggy at
[50:06] the time to what you needed because
[50:08] we'll read here in just a minute where
[50:09] brother Brown talks about people going
[50:10] out past Revelation or going out past
[50:14] the plan of God and he calls them scrap
[50:16] heaps right
[50:18] we'll read it maybe in just a little bit
[50:20] but there was something in the call out
[50:22] for more of a
[50:29] good we're in now but can you remember
[50:31] when you first started justification
[50:34] sanctification started coming to church
[50:36] got cleaned up
[50:37] uh you had a desire what was that that
[50:39] was the Deep call that the Deep was
[50:40] coming out
[50:42] whatever was in there see that old
[50:43] unclean spirit that was inside there was
[50:45] pulling in this direction but when the
[50:47] unclean Spirit went out
[50:49] remember brother Brown said you got a
[50:50] new heart you got a new spirit but not
[50:51] his spirit yet but you got a new purpose
[50:53] in life that new purpose is that call
[50:56] and then when they give you the holy
[50:58] ghost that was the truth that's why that
[51:00] me me and people say well I I know I got
[51:03] the Holy Ghost I went to church or I
[51:05] know I got the Holy Ghost because I
[51:06] believe brother Brown was a prophet that
[51:08] don't mean nothing that's right
[51:09] nothing
[51:11] but when that thing down inside of you
[51:14] speaks out and when that thing inside of
[51:17] you says that ain't nothing but the
[51:18] truth and that thing inside of you wants
[51:20] to come to church more than wants to sit
[51:22] at home
[51:23] that's the deed that calls to the deep I
[51:25] want more Revelation I want to read more
[51:28] I want to study more
[51:31] I want to listen I want to learn how to
[51:33] praise God and not the devil I want to
[51:35] learn how to praise here and not the
[51:37] world
[51:40] I mean come on you see these people go
[51:42] to these cells used to what Black Friday
[51:45] they might kill each other to get in the
[51:47] door to save fifteen dollars
[51:49] yeah everybody knows they've been I went
[51:51] one time and I did get a revelation
[51:58] we were in Augusta Well Jim's mom and I
[52:01] don't think Gene went bless his heart he
[52:03] had a lot of he had a lot of Revelation
[52:05] but I decided to go with him one day we
[52:08] got caught in Best Buy or somewhere
[52:10] and I mean these people I wish y'all
[52:13] would act that way sometime
[52:15] over a 25 radio
[52:18] they saved 15 bucks so they're piling
[52:21] them and they're get away from it you
[52:23] know picking people out of the way
[52:24] buggies you know they're bumping buggies
[52:26] they're bumping them
[52:28] they were happy they were gonna save
[52:30] some money
[52:32] why am I saving your life amen that's
[52:35] what this is it's going to save your
[52:36] life
[52:39] it'll be a Black Friday if you don't get
[52:41] born again and a Saturday and a Sunday I
[52:44] don't mind the attitude's getting away
[52:45] at the end of Thursday and Friday
[52:49] I don't know where that came from but
[52:52] that was on sale so I give it to you
[52:54] but you see how people act and then we
[52:57] we then we then we come to church and we
[52:58] go
[53:04] listen I know emotion has nothing to do
[53:06] with it but listen if you're alive and
[53:09] something inside of you is bubbling out
[53:11] there's got to be a time when you can
[53:12] just say oh praise the Lord
[53:17] give him the praise
[53:20] now the very reason that there is a holy
[53:22] spirit is because what you were
[53:24] hungering for it
[53:26] you would never hunger
[53:30] to call for th there now see that's
[53:33] where I believe that seed is or not
[53:34] inside of you it's a representation that
[53:37] he knew you would one day say hey I'm
[53:39] done I'm done I'm tired of running I'm
[53:43] tired of uh stumbling over my own self
[53:47] tired of my life going backwards
[53:50] I'm sick and tired of being sick and
[53:51] tired
[53:55] see listen people in the people in the
[53:58] world they're the same way they're just
[54:00] striving brother Brown talks about this
[54:02] hungry he talks about deep calls to the
[54:04] Deep he talks about the boy that that
[54:06] eats um pedals off the bicycle why he's
[54:08] looking for sulfur
[54:10] same over me and you when we get hungry
[54:13] what do we do we desire food obviously
[54:16] right
[54:17] but where's that come from
[54:20] your body is saying I'm hungry I need to
[54:23] eat
[54:24] your body is saying hey somebody I
[54:27] hadn't seen in 20 years is coming to
[54:29] visit wow oh I'm so glad they're coming
[54:31] I'm so glad that this is happening well
[54:34] guess what be so glad that you get to
[54:36] see God on Saturday and Sunday and
[54:39] Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday
[54:42] but there's one thing for sure
[54:45] he promised he'd be right here if we'd
[54:48] be here
[54:49] and even if you're not here he's here
[54:51] anyway
[54:52] amen
[54:54] I like what one a preacher said one time
[54:57] he said there's going to be a lot of
[54:58] people miss it because they weren't at
[55:00] church for their visitation
[55:05] I'll make it quiet praise the Lord
[55:07] anyhow but then but the plan of God is
[55:10] he's moving on whether you you're going
[55:12] to decide whether to stay here you're
[55:13] going to decide I wouldn't move on
[55:15] so you just might miss your day of
[55:17] visitation
[55:19] there's nothing such providing powers or
[55:21] revelation of the word of God let's
[55:23] continue on let's hear it too I'm sorry
[55:25] I'm not going to get to my point brother
[55:27] Brown talks about
[55:29] um um he makes a quote about the spirit
[55:31] of wisdom but here in Ephesians it talks
[55:33] about giving you the spirit of wisdom
[55:34] and Revelation and the knowledge of him
[55:36] that's what we want that the eyes of our
[55:38] understanding being enlightened not
[55:40] these eyes
[55:42] the eyes of our understanding being
[55:45] enlightened in other words revelated
[55:47] that you may know what is the hope of
[55:49] his calling in other words what what his
[55:51] plan is
[55:52] because it says The Inheritance what is
[55:54] the inheritance of people it's the word
[55:57] of God
[55:58] because his will is his word
[56:01] regardless evil age brother Brian said
[56:03] why would call what would call God call
[56:05] a people out of his evil age for for his
[56:08] name this is the worst day most uh
[56:11] intolerable I'll read it maybe read it
[56:14] this afternoon talk about being
[56:15] incontinent talking about being uh
[56:17] accusers and abusers and and feminine
[56:20] and all these different things why'd he
[56:22] put us here
[56:24] why'd he put us in this age
[56:27] to overcome that and there's going to be
[56:30] a people that will overcome that and the
[56:32] reason is is to try her his bride he's
[56:36] not trying the world out there
[56:39] because remember if you're tried and
[56:42] grown from it you're a child if you are
[56:44] put in a trial and you don't you're a
[56:47] bastard
[56:48] and God don't ever have bastard children
[56:49] right
[56:51] sorry but
[56:53] that's the way the Bible says
[56:55] the reason of it is is to try her his
[56:58] bride when she is made manifest been
[57:01] tried been proven proved to who not to
[57:04] your neighbor poo to Satan
[57:06] like it was at the beginning so shall it
[57:08] be at the end you talk about the seed
[57:10] into the ground
[57:12] it ends up in the last days under the
[57:14] ministry of Malachi 4 that's where we're
[57:16] at and restores back again the original
[57:18] faith that was once given we've already
[57:20] covered that we find out this evil age
[57:22] is to prove to Satan
[57:26] prove to Satan amen that she's not like
[57:29] that Eve that come in the first
[57:31] that she is not that type of a woman she
[57:33] will be Tried by his word the bride as
[57:36] Adam bride Adam's bride was Tried by the
[57:38] word now remember Adam's bride did what
[57:40] fell
[57:42] this bride will not fall
[57:44] don't ever come and tell me that it
[57:46] looks bleak and and and dark for the
[57:49] bride
[57:51] no listen I was thinking about this
[57:53] morning
[57:54] you take the chosen of God which is
[57:56] Israel right if we don't get anything
[57:57] else we'll get to this the children the
[58:00] chosen people of God they're my kids
[58:02] they're the Jews takes him out of Egypt
[58:05] two million strong
[58:08] but remember part of them were a mixed
[58:11] multitude
[58:13] so if you were to stand on a on a
[58:15] Mountaintop and look down across that
[58:17] mixed multitude you would see the Jews
[58:19] doing what God Said
[58:23] but you'd also mixed among all that
[58:25] you'd see the Heathen working on sun
[58:28] Saturday
[58:30] yeah right worshiping their idols
[58:34] eating their food
[58:37] same way here
[58:40] not all Israel is Israel that Paul said
[58:42] because Paul could see the same thing by
[58:43] Revelation that it was the mixed
[58:45] multitude that gave Moses the most
[58:48] troubled but remember the reason I was
[58:51] thinking about this I thought man you
[58:52] know God told him not to do anything on
[58:54] Saturday nothing on the Sabbath day
[58:55] right remember the guy that was picking
[58:57] up sticks they caught him and they
[58:58] killed him
[58:59] why was he doing that he knew better you
[59:02] know why he saw his neighbor do it who
[59:03] wasn't a Jew he saw his neighbor do come
[59:06] on somebody he saw his neighbor do it he
[59:08] wasn't a Christian
[59:09] so they thought it was okay for him to
[59:11] do it
[59:13] that's why I've been in the message of
[59:15] the hour we're getting too close to the
[59:17] the world and not farther away
[59:21] fence dwellers
[59:24] fence dwellers would get you killed
[59:28] but I am the chosen of God
[59:30] I will do what God Said
[59:32] I will honor the Sabbath day we know
[59:35] that with all the all the Ten
[59:36] Commandments but if you'll look but you
[59:38] feel that was a bystander looking from
[59:40] here on on the hill you're like why are
[59:42] these people do well it's the same way
[59:44] don't say there's listen the bride has
[59:46] never been in bad shape
[59:48] never I don't care if the Dark Ages when
[59:50] they killed you just for saying that you
[59:52] love the Lord
[59:58] then he give us the Seven Seals
[1:00:00] and just for a minute
[1:00:02] he gave us the Seven Seals
[1:00:05] as a promise
[1:00:07] that they would be sealed up until the
[1:00:09] end time
[1:00:11] told Daniel seal this up until the time
[1:00:14] of the end
[1:00:15] and they've been sealed up we know you
[1:00:17] know why we know they sealed up they
[1:00:19] were sealed up
[1:00:20] because they've been open
[1:00:23] because they've been open the prophet of
[1:00:26] God took those sales and and God through
[1:00:29] him opened those seals up that we could
[1:00:30] see there was not some mystery so much
[1:00:33] as the world would see the four horse
[1:00:35] riders and all these different things
[1:00:36] but it was a Plan of Redemption
[1:00:39] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:00:41] of Holy Ghost and the word of God the
[1:00:43] force seal being the word of God made
[1:00:45] manifest in a group of people to take a
[1:00:47] Rapture because a Rapture happens on the
[1:00:49] fourth seal all right now don't let it
[1:00:51] confuse you but that's what the prophet
[1:00:53] said if you'll just use a little
[1:00:55] intelligence a little bit of of not
[1:00:57] worldly knowledge but a little bit of
[1:00:58] Godly knowledge you'll see that the four
[1:01:01] horseriders and the four beasts they're
[1:01:04] no more on the fifth seal six cylinder
[1:01:06] seventh seal so brother Ram said
[1:01:07] therefore the bride must be gone so the
[1:01:10] bride take a Rapture in the for sale but
[1:01:12] the seventh seal is our rapture
[1:01:15] so don't get confused because remember
[1:01:17] you're going through the outer Court the
[1:01:19] inner Court the holy of holies and just
[1:01:21] like the the when we were receiving then
[1:01:23] reading in Ezekiel
[1:01:25] God brings you right back out in that
[1:01:26] court again and then you got living at a
[1:01:28] higher level you got to live it at a
[1:01:30] higher level
[1:01:32] see if you take the if you take the
[1:01:34] first seal as being type in Redemption
[1:01:37] they're all part of redemption but type
[1:01:39] it as justification knowing that there's
[1:01:42] one true and living God if that one true
[1:01:43] and God has done away with your sins all
[1:01:46] right well now
[1:01:47] that should be as we were talking today
[1:01:49] because everybody would be so happy that
[1:01:52] all of our sins you know we wouldn't no
[1:01:54] more be found
[1:01:55] we couldn't remember them no more well
[1:01:57] I'm just glad he don't remember
[1:01:59] I'm not worried about if you do that's
[1:02:01] what they call Grace for
[1:02:03] him but God didn't just give us Grace he
[1:02:05] gave us Grace for the moment he gave us
[1:02:07] so much grace it just eradicated all the
[1:02:10] back
[1:02:12] hey if he remembers one time
[1:02:15] then you've not took all that to God
[1:02:17] you're still holding on to it
[1:02:20] if you hadn't just took it to the Lord
[1:02:22] and said here I I don't want this no
[1:02:24] more he takes it to the father and says
[1:02:27] hey they're doing they're confessing
[1:02:29] positive confession not a negative
[1:02:32] confession positive confession so then
[1:02:35] we see this that seal number one seal
[1:02:37] number two is what sanctification which
[1:02:39] is this guy it's it's cleaning up that
[1:02:41] middle guy that's that Spirit realm is
[1:02:44] taking the unclean Spirit out brother
[1:02:46] Brown talks about putting a new spirit
[1:02:47] in and putting giving you a new heart
[1:02:49] but not his heart yet or it's spirit yet
[1:02:51] right
[1:02:54] so what's the third and that horseradish
[1:02:56] red
[1:02:57] is blood red is always simple
[1:03:00] sanctification yes always the blood of
[1:03:03] Jesus Christ is what sanctifies US Keeps
[1:03:05] Us Sanctified all right
[1:03:08] then the baptism of my Holy Ghost
[1:03:09] there's a black horse you get a boy you
[1:03:11] say well how in the world does that
[1:03:12] happen well you guys become dead before
[1:03:15] the Holy Ghost can come inside of you
[1:03:16] you've got to get rid of that darkness
[1:03:19] and that Blackness and get rid of it to
[1:03:21] get the baptism of the Holy Ghost then
[1:03:23] we go to number four which is which is a
[1:03:26] Pale Horse which is
[1:03:28] White
[1:03:30] red
[1:03:32] and black pour them in a paint can try
[1:03:35] it sometime do it naturally pour them in
[1:03:38] a paint can and stir them up the most
[1:03:39] putrid color you've ever seen in your
[1:03:41] life pale that's what the Pale Horse is
[1:03:44] he's all then wound up together well
[1:03:46] what is the foresee them it's all of you
[1:03:48] wound up together in the word of God
[1:03:50] that when you get all wound up in the
[1:03:51] word of God you're going to Rapture yeah
[1:03:54] it got finished with us at that time you
[1:03:56] say what about the fifth cell six cell
[1:03:58] seven seal yeah that's the Israel but
[1:04:00] see that's where we bring it back
[1:04:02] that's when we bring it back to here
[1:04:04] this right here is now our second stage
[1:04:08] of justification and sanctification
[1:04:10] thereby with me
[1:04:12] all right we've already got the new
[1:04:13] birth down here because this afternoon
[1:04:15] we're going to read the quote and
[1:04:16] blaspheme its name for brother Brown
[1:04:18] said you've come all this way and you
[1:04:20] don't have the Holy Ghost yet and he
[1:04:21] only had us right here
[1:04:24] it stumbles a lot of people
[1:04:27] but it should never stumble us
[1:04:29] because you must be born again first
[1:04:33] he didn't say it would come all this way
[1:04:34] and you ain't got the new birth yet
[1:04:36] he said you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:04:38] yet
[1:04:39] all right that's an anointing
[1:04:42] not to birth
[1:04:45] but now down here it is both about with
[1:04:48] me when you get born again you get the
[1:04:49] baptism of the Holy Ghost but he wants
[1:04:51] to put you in service now yes yeah when
[1:04:53] he puts you in service what do you do
[1:04:58] not even in service
[1:05:00] and service is going up that statue of
[1:05:03] perfect man being drawn up
[1:05:06] being pressured
[1:05:08] up
[1:05:09] he's pulling us up
[1:05:11] so the fifth seal what we were talking
[1:05:13] about the fifth seal the other day uh
[1:05:15] well in conversation with somebody the
[1:05:17] fifth seal is the Jews yes it is to the
[1:05:19] Jews but thank God for a prophet that
[1:05:22] told us that those people didn't want to
[1:05:24] be saved
[1:05:26] did you
[1:05:28] um
[1:05:30] so see that's a higher form of
[1:05:31] justification the real you didn't do it
[1:05:33] God didn't hold it against those Jews
[1:05:36] even though they said let his blood be
[1:05:39] on us and our children deny Jesus was a
[1:05:41] messiah
[1:05:43] denied that God had come in human flesh
[1:05:45] they're looking for him yes but he gave
[1:05:48] white roads brother collie he gave white
[1:05:50] robes to those people because he was the
[1:05:54] justifier he said I'm going to do this
[1:05:57] for them just like me and you he said
[1:05:59] I'm going to for them they can't justify
[1:06:01] themselves
[1:06:03] so I'm going to justify a group of
[1:06:05] people that don't even want me
[1:06:07] praise God
[1:06:09] what about grace and mercy
[1:06:11] so that comes to me and you as we go to
[1:06:14] the Capstone to where God will be able
[1:06:17] to use us again like he wanted to back
[1:06:20] when when Adam was standing on Earth he
[1:06:23] wanted to use Adam
[1:06:25] to rule the world
[1:06:27] and to have his kids
[1:06:29] and his kids only
[1:06:32] listen he was going to have kids whether
[1:06:34] you think it was one way or the other
[1:06:36] all right he wasn't going to be by sex
[1:06:37] because sex is what killed us
[1:06:39] all right so the spoken word of God was
[1:06:41] already put there in Genesis 1 26 he
[1:06:44] said let us make man and let him
[1:06:46] multiply wasn't even human flesh see we
[1:06:48] can't find them that
[1:06:51] see we as humans have to have human
[1:06:53] flesh to multiply ourselves
[1:06:56] but spiritual multiplication started on
[1:06:58] the day of Pentecost
[1:07:00] under that Pentecost 120 little jesuses
[1:07:03] were born then three thousand little
[1:07:04] jesuses were born now there's Millions
[1:07:06] upon millions of little Jesus is running
[1:07:08] around here brother Dale brother Mo
[1:07:10] started with 10 or 12 people foreign
[1:07:13] there's been a spiritual multiplication
[1:07:15] going on
[1:07:17] turn out look at your neighbor because
[1:07:19] that's what happened my spiritual
[1:07:21] multiplication
[1:07:23] he's brought a group of people together
[1:07:27] brothers and sisters Sons and Daughters
[1:07:29] of God Amen amen the bride all these
[1:07:32] things
[1:07:33] see he has many titles but so do we but
[1:07:36] we're only one person
[1:07:38] one person
[1:07:40] so the six seat watch The Sixth Seal I
[1:07:42] just read what it was it was total
[1:07:43] Destruction of nature it was where that
[1:07:45] the whole nature of this Earth is going
[1:07:47] to be pulled apart
[1:07:49] by two prophets by the word of God
[1:07:52] listen the same word you're hearing
[1:07:54] today not verbatim but the same word the
[1:07:57] same message is going to come right off
[1:07:59] of this Gentile group and go right over
[1:08:01] there on those two prophets and they're
[1:08:03] going to preach and they're going to say
[1:08:05] hey
[1:08:06] look back there
[1:08:09] he's not coming for you like you think
[1:08:11] he is he's already come remember what
[1:08:14] Zechariah somewhere they they say
[1:08:16] where'd you get those scars he's in the
[1:08:17] house with my friends Well that took
[1:08:18] them way back
[1:08:20] to to 2000 years ago when they hung him
[1:08:22] on the cross then they started like oh
[1:08:24] my word where you know in other words we
[1:08:25] have no like me and you
[1:08:28] when me and you when we first come to
[1:08:30] God did the devil go well that's okay I
[1:08:33] don't mind losing you yeah go ahead yeah
[1:08:35] Lord can have you no he took his grubby
[1:08:39] fingers and he went
[1:08:43] I got some me and sister Regina's only
[1:08:45] two in the house
[1:08:47] maybe sister Rebecca is number three
[1:08:52] I'm waiting
[1:08:54] but he stuck his grumpy fingers and he
[1:08:57] wanted to keep you
[1:08:58] it won't let you go
[1:09:01] he want to keep you
[1:09:04] but by the power of the word of God I'm
[1:09:07] done I don't want no more of this I want
[1:09:10] this garbage
[1:09:12] I want my nature to be changed if I can
[1:09:15] ever get my nature changed brother
[1:09:16] Brandon just a little small
[1:09:18] illustrations that he used to say he
[1:09:20] said if I had in my soul today if I
[1:09:23] could take John Dillinger which was a
[1:09:25] for those of you kids that don't know it
[1:09:27] Google it he was a master criminal he
[1:09:29] was a murderer I mean he was like
[1:09:31] enemies uh Public Enemy Number One
[1:09:34] they were looking for John Dillinger and
[1:09:36] you know what got him
[1:09:38] a movie
[1:09:42] right
[1:09:43] he went in the movie theater and
[1:09:44] somebody ratted on him and when he came
[1:09:46] out they took him out
[1:09:48] they wasn't even no question they
[1:09:50] wouldn't even know I'm gonna read you
[1:09:52] your rights the rights that he got come
[1:09:53] out of the end of a barrel
[1:09:55] that's how that's how awful he was but
[1:09:58] brother Brown makes an illustration he
[1:09:59] said now if the spirit of John Dillinger
[1:10:01] would would come off of him and come
[1:10:03] into me he said I'd be a gangster yeah
[1:10:05] yeah same way with all of us because you
[1:10:07] know what the spirit you were born with
[1:10:09] that old Dynamic nature was anointed by
[1:10:12] Satan and that's who you acted like
[1:10:15] so now we want that nature as we said
[1:10:17] before you know we want it but you know
[1:10:20] what God said I'll take it away from you
[1:10:22] don't worry if you'll do what I say get
[1:10:24] in the plan
[1:10:25] confess your sins
[1:10:28] I take that stuff away from you
[1:10:31] but to what the sex seal is going to do
[1:10:33] is it's gonna get you in changing
[1:10:36] the changing of the body Department
[1:10:38] that's why we're heading toward we're
[1:10:41] not just going to jump from wrong one
[1:10:42] all the way up to wrong ten
[1:10:44] 12 14 never have many seven eight no the
[1:10:50] plan is that we grow
[1:10:52] the plan is that brother Brown said
[1:10:55] if you don't get the foundation right he
[1:10:56] said you'll climb up that ladder and say
[1:10:58] to all you all of a sudden you'll fall
[1:10:59] off
[1:11:01] Jesus told us he said what a man that
[1:11:03] would build
[1:11:04] on a sandbar
[1:11:07] and a storm come
[1:11:08] I just blew him right away
[1:11:11] he said if you build your house on a
[1:11:12] rock
[1:11:14] a revelation you built your house on
[1:11:17] that the Gates of Hell will not Prevail
[1:11:19] they're coming and they're here but
[1:11:21] they're not going to Prevail against me
[1:11:23] and you praise God so what is a seventh
[1:11:26] seal that's Christ on the earth in a
[1:11:30] bride yes yes
[1:11:33] The Headstone not coming here
[1:11:38] not the Cornerstone part of it but the
[1:11:42] headstone
[1:11:43] so that's what we're heading toward s so
[1:11:45] the seals fit right in with everything
[1:11:46] to me the seals just ties everything
[1:11:48] together brother Brian said tied the
[1:11:50] whole Bible together
[1:11:52] now you've got to be able to understand
[1:11:53] that it tied the entire Bible together
[1:11:55] but if you'll see that it's a Plan of
[1:11:57] Redemption what is it what's the Bible
[1:11:59] that's right the Bibles The Plan of
[1:12:02] Redemption from the beginning to the end
[1:12:06] right
[1:12:08] that's the plan
[1:12:10] we just got to attach ourselves to that
[1:12:13] so that we go we've been through virtue
[1:12:15] and knowledge and Temperance so I want
[1:12:16] to stop right here just demand
[1:12:17] temperatures for a few minutes
[1:12:19] besides just giving all deals out to
[1:12:21] your faith virtually the Virgin
[1:12:22] knowledge knowledge Temperance
[1:12:23] Temperance patience patience godliness
[1:12:25] that word temperance
[1:12:27] is self-control
[1:12:29] the virtue of one who Masters his
[1:12:32] desires and passions especially his
[1:12:35] sensual appetite
[1:12:37] mastering controlling curbing
[1:12:39] restraining controlling oneself
[1:12:42] temperate continent
[1:12:45] I'll read scripture a few minutes worth
[1:12:47] in the end time
[1:12:49] we become an incontinent people
[1:12:52] now for those of us get older we know
[1:12:54] what incontinence is but those who don't
[1:12:57] know what it is is you can't hold
[1:12:58] yourself
[1:12:59] okay
[1:13:01] ten percent means stop drinking alcohol
[1:13:03] either no 10 doesn't mean alcohol cure
[1:13:06] not in this case this is Bible
[1:13:08] Temperance Holy Ghost Temperance that's
[1:13:10] just one of the lusts of the flesh he's
[1:13:11] talking about the drinking but we're
[1:13:13] talking about Holy Spirit Temperance
[1:13:15] that means how to control your tongue
[1:13:17] not to be a titler how to control your
[1:13:19] temper not fly off every time anybody
[1:13:21] speaks cost to you oh my boy a lot of us
[1:13:24] going to fall off before we get started
[1:13:26] aren't we he said we
[1:13:28] see when we wonder why God is not in his
[1:13:30] church
[1:13:33] I ask you the same thing then we wonder
[1:13:35] why God is not in his church doing
[1:13:37] Miracles and things it used to do yes
[1:13:39] sir why because we got our flu stopped
[1:13:42] up
[1:13:44] brother Brown
[1:13:45] drip perfect man says I had Temperance
[1:13:47] oh Temperance how to answer in kindness
[1:13:49] when Wrath
[1:13:51] it spoke to you somebody says you bunch
[1:13:53] of Holy Rollers don't jump up and roll
[1:13:55] up your sleeve and now but talk with
[1:13:57] Godly love Temperance and kindness
[1:14:01] is that the way you want to be
[1:14:07] when you're riled upon round not back
[1:14:09] let him be your example then you say if
[1:14:12] thou be the Son of God turn these stones
[1:14:14] of bread he could have done it and
[1:14:16] showed he was God but he had Temperance
[1:14:18] when they called him Bells above he said
[1:14:20] I'll forgive you for that they pulled
[1:14:22] hands full of beard out of his face and
[1:14:23] spit in his face and said come down off
[1:14:25] the cross he was having a pretty bad day
[1:14:28] he said father forgive them they don't
[1:14:30] know what they're doing
[1:14:32] when he had the gift he knowed all
[1:14:34] things for in him was the fullness of
[1:14:36] the godhead bodily he had seen they had
[1:14:38] seen him perform Miracles by telling
[1:14:40] people what was wrong with them so forth
[1:14:41] they put a rag on his head and around
[1:14:43] his eyes and hit him on the back of the
[1:14:44] head with a stick said prophesy tell us
[1:14:46] who hit you
[1:14:48] we'll believe you he had temperance now
[1:14:51] if you got it like that add it to your
[1:14:54] faith if you still blow up in SASS and
[1:14:56] fuss and stew and carry on uh you ain't
[1:14:58] got no can't add that because it won't
[1:15:00] add see it won't vulcanize you couldn't
[1:15:03] take a piece of rubber and vulcanize it
[1:15:05] to a piece of iron we don't discuss what
[1:15:06] vulcanization is it just won't work it's
[1:15:09] got to be flexible just like the rubber
[1:15:10] is that's why God said I'll give you a
[1:15:12] heart of Flesh in other words something
[1:15:14] pliable something he can work with God
[1:15:17] can't work with a Stony heart
[1:15:19] when your faith and your Temperance
[1:15:21] becomes the same kind of look Holy Ghost
[1:15:24] temperance that he had then it will
[1:15:27] vulcanize with him you're added to it
[1:15:29] let's continue reading
[1:15:31] talk about vulcanization again when you
[1:15:33] get the right counter Temperance like he
[1:15:34] had it'll vulcanized if you've got just
[1:15:36] a man-made halfway South stuck believe
[1:15:38] for temperance oh I'd have slapped him
[1:15:40] but I might give a name in the paper
[1:15:43] that ain't the kind of temperance he's
[1:15:44] talking about don't try to add that it
[1:15:46] won't work but when you can really with
[1:15:48] the sweetness from your heart forgive
[1:15:49] every man hold your peace let it be gone
[1:15:52] see then it'll vulcanized you can add
[1:15:54] that to your faith now we talked about
[1:15:55] the impact of vulcanization I think we
[1:15:57] know what it is I just really appreciate
[1:16:00] that they put this part in here that
[1:16:01] after rubber is vulcanized it cannot be
[1:16:04] reversed after God has burnt all you out
[1:16:08] and put the new you in brother John
[1:16:10] can't be reversed
[1:16:12] can't be there's no going backwards in
[1:16:15] God
[1:16:16] now there's going backwards in you but
[1:16:19] not going backwards in God
[1:16:21] that's where you just right here and
[1:16:23] then we'll then we'll close second
[1:16:24] Timothy three this know also in the last
[1:16:27] days how many believe we in the last day
[1:16:28] amen all right perilous time shall come

[1:17:15] longing for the same thing he's praying
[1:17:18] make us true stewards may we shape Our
[1:17:21] Lives by self-control that's what
[1:17:22] Temperance is that we will know by the
[1:17:25] help of the Holy Spirit to have a full
[1:17:27] confidence that Jesus will say Well done
[1:17:31] my good and faithful servant at that day
[1:17:34] and I told you the other day about I
[1:17:35] want God to be proud of us

[1:18:01] I've got to add patience that's what
[1:18:02] we're going to get to this afternoon
[1:18:04] right here's what he said I still ain't
[1:18:06] got the Holy Ghost
[1:18:08] that's a direct quote now he didn't say
[1:18:11] I don't have the new birth
[1:18:12] he said I don't have the Holy Ghost In
[1:18:14] other words he don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:18:15] right there to do this one thing right
[1:18:17] here let's read this real quick
[1:18:18] Ephesians 4 verse 15 the Bible hasn't
[1:18:21] answered everything speaking the truth
[1:18:22] in love may grow up into him in all
[1:18:24] things which is the head even Christ
[1:18:25] from whom the whole body
[1:18:28] all right now that's us
[1:18:30] Finley joined together and compacted
[1:18:34] that's what the Holy Ghost does it fills
[1:18:35] in the cracks
[1:18:38] and compacted by that which every joint
[1:18:41] supplies according to the effectual
[1:18:43] working in the measure of every part
[1:18:45] makeeth the increase of the body until
[1:18:47] the edifying of itself in love that word
[1:18:49] compacted means knit together I looked
[1:18:52] up this big word it says to cause to
[1:18:54] colise that means come together to form
[1:18:57] one Mass
[1:18:59] one Mass you are today one body as a
[1:19:03] human it is one Mass it is totally
[1:19:04] connected I hope together
[1:19:07] well that's the way the body of Christ
[1:19:09] is supposed to be
[1:19:11] not an arm missing not a leg missing
[1:19:14] come together to form one Mass to join
[1:19:16] together put together unite or knit
[1:19:18] together what infection to put together
[1:19:21] in one's mind to compare to gather
[1:19:23] conclude and consider to cause a person
[1:19:26] to unite with one in a conclusion or
[1:19:30] come to the same opinion to prove
[1:19:32] demonstrate to teach and to instruct the

[1:23:54] he gave us a spiritual life
[1:23:56] ninny came in and gave us a new birth
[1:23:59] birthed us into the family of God and
[1:24:02] you know what an heir does an heir gets
[1:24:04] everything that the father has to offer
[1:24:08] everything that makes you an heir of God
[1:24:10] and Joint heirs with Christ
[1:24:13] we got to believe that
[1:24:16] that we're not going to get something we
[1:24:18] already got it
[1:24:19] things already written down here all we
[1:24:21] got to do is what plug ourselves into it
[1:24:24] I like what brother Ernie says plug
[1:24:26] yourself into the eternal
[1:24:28] that's why I lie you plug yourself and
[1:24:30] you got to do it he's not gonna pull and
[1:24:32] grab your cord and plug it you got to
[1:24:33] pull it yourself plug it in say I want
[1:24:35] to be a part of that I want that energy
[1:24:38] you know that's what's so great you look
[1:24:40] at a house
[1:24:42] I was thinking about this the other day
[1:24:43] you take a house and you've got a line
[1:24:46] coming in from the power company it's
[1:24:48] just one big line right it goes into the
[1:24:51] back of that panel right there bro John
[1:24:53] it comes in at whatever it is 400 watts
[1:24:55] I mean if you just if you touched it
[1:24:57] you're dead
[1:24:58] all right and then if you took something
[1:25:00] and plugged it into it it just blew it
[1:25:02] to pieces
[1:25:04] right
[1:25:05] but there's still power
[1:25:07] it's the same power that goes through
[1:25:09] that light right there but it has what
[1:25:11] been divided
[1:25:13] on the day of Pentecost that power
[1:25:16] divided
[1:25:17] and it was where the people could then
[1:25:19] stand it
[1:25:20] they brought John you plug stuff into it
[1:25:23] now and we'll blow you up it'll make you
[1:25:26] happy it'll give you light it'll give
[1:25:28] you peace it'll give you Joy so it
[1:25:31] listen the I was already there just plug
[1:25:33] into it
[1:25:34] I'll praise God think about that that
[1:25:38] power's sitting there just waiting to be
[1:25:40] used
[1:25:41] not developing is already in that box
[1:25:45] just go over there and plug it in let it
[1:25:47] divide out
[1:25:49] on the dead Pentecost and all down
[1:25:52] through the churches has been dividing
[1:25:53] that power coming from the same line
[1:25:57] but that same line was hard to take
[1:26:00] it was so powerful
[1:26:03] but he came down and came into 120.
[1:26:07] then 3 000.
[1:26:10] and then it keeps going and people just
[1:26:12] what then they can just come bowling and
[1:26:15] and not worry about what you plug in
[1:26:17] because it's already been provided for
[1:26:20] you
[1:26:21] those plugins right there can take a
[1:26:23] certain amount of voltage
[1:26:24] right
[1:26:26] so it's there all the time
[1:26:28] all you gotta do is what plug it in
[1:26:31] and lights come on
[1:26:33] I want the light to come on each one of
[1:26:35] us plug in and get say Lord give me a
[1:26:38] boost give me a little boost of power
[1:26:40] you know I've been running on 110. I
[1:26:43] think I can stand 220. just plug me into
[1:26:46] 220. and let's see if I can go you know
[1:26:48] what you know what happened whatever's
[1:26:50] plugged into 110 if it gets plugged into
[1:26:52] 220 you'll go
