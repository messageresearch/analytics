and better amen i sure like it god bless you brother samuel sister peggy good to be able to be in the same room with you amen and i appreciate the the confidence and and the love that brother samuel has shown to me and brother wade amen sister june and and all of you it's a real real privilege and real honor and i'm happy to be able to find another place where we can share god's word the way he's revealed it to us and if you'll notice i i i do this on purpose i i know i've been i've been put upon by not men in our church but men and other church hey brother you read too many quotes well you read too much scripture do you understand where i'm coming from see it's been revealed to me that the message of the hour is the bible in a more modern interpretation but then even in that there is revelation hidden in there that ties it back to the bible that's the reason why we can go back and forth between the scripture and the message and not miss it does everybody know what a dovetail is it's not the tail of a bird it's a fitting in cabinetry and woodwork where you put together the two sides of the drawer and i'll tell you what a dovetail usually forms a corner we're turning corner after corner after corner right now god is good to us if you take your bibles ephesians chapter one we'll just continue on i'll get as far as the lord leads and well you just have to be hungry enough to look into the word of god and finish the course that's what paul said he did that's what we're going to do run the race finish the course fight the good fight when you have ephesians 1 say amen we're going to read verses 3 through 9 and then 15-23 and yes i will try really hard not to preach on every word blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ yeah who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us under the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself man we can't lose according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself now i'm going to hold on and not read verse 10 let's drop down to 15. wherefore i also after i heard of your faith in the lord jesus paul got excited and loved unto all the saints cease not to give thanks for you i want you to notice not to you for you making mention of you in my prayers that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened see you have eyes of understanding but they require enlightenment that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us for who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places well i thought he came forth to get the book out of his own right hand far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world which means this age but also in that which is to come and have put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all let's pray father lord without you we could do and we would be nothing but with you lord we are all things in christ we're so grateful father for the revelation of it for the sweet words lord that you'll speak to us through father and we realize it's by revelation because you spoke to many father but it just got boiled down to a handful or two lord that actually would stand by without understanding lord but to whom else could they go for you alone and you alone lord have the words of eternal life we pray father that you'd help us let us settle down lord let let the food that we partake in of father let it not overcome us father let us be on the edge of our seats father waiting to hear from you we didn't come here to hear a man lord we didn't come to see one father we came here because you asked us if we would like to come and we responded by being here father and we're willing to receive be it unto us according to thy word in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you may be seated now while you've got ephesians in your hand i said i i didn't purposely skip over verse 10 but the reason that i stopped right there is because i would have had to preach on it verse 10 ephesians 1 that in the dispensation of the fullness of times now remember something because i've heard different ministers speak on this and i don't disagree with them but part of what i think there is a misunderstanding on is the word dispensation dispensation is a span it's not an instance it's a span of time and activities start take place and then eventually play themselves out in the word dispensation so you see it's it's it's like the age that we live in now we live in the laodicean church h is that right but the prophet of god mentions the bride h he mentions an eternal h he mentions a rapturing h now what we need to understand is that only for the bride she realizes that the laodicean church age is this dispensation or expanse of time and while she has to live in it she's not of it you see that's why there was an open door between the sixth and the seventh age you come up come on up there's a door open now you and i didn't open it it was already opened it was open because god used a man to open that door but now we're in the seventh age the most treacherous the most deceiving the most diabolical [Laughter] but the most complete age because seven is completion in god's mathematical realm that's why i i try to instill in you and the people that i speak to we have a job to do we have something that we can accomplish you may not realize that in your day-to-day walk and thoughts but brothers and sisters god has ordained a group of people and he's defined them this way we which are alive and remain amen shall not hinder those which have gone on before us and i'll tell you why the word hinder is used is because we've come to the realization through the revelation of the word that we can't hinder them because they without us cannot be made perfect so therefore we're told they're waiting on us why would they be waiting on us we're not going to die waiting on us to come to the full mature revelation of the plan of god and that god has children that will fulfill every word we're not talking about the letter of the law because you see the word is the logos it's not the letters on the papers that we're reading it's the manifestation of the supernatural god now that manifestation that logos has to become flesh in order to complete the cycle that's why jesus christ came walked talked breathed ate and and you think he was pain-free oh no oh no he was far from pain-free and look at the kind of body he was walking in he wasn't walking in the kind of body that you and i walk in it wasn't brought into this world the way that you and i were brought through you understand through desire it was brought by the word of god amen yet in that he aged he got tired he had severe headaches we're told migraines unbelievable because that man that we know as jesus was a man [Music] but he had the life the spirit of god living in him still with me all right verse 10 that in the dispensation of the fullness of times so now we're going to wind up everything he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him now i'll tell you what gets me right there the word gather you know me i'm going to read you the definition because brothers and sisters that's how god reveals these things to me and gives them so that i can also give them out amen just bear with me it's here it's awesome so i'm going to look for it till i find it i got it here somewhere just bear with me i'm sure i put it in here because it'll become important to you and me as we begin to find out what these things mean well i had it here somewhere i ain't going to worry about it the word gather in the bible is to bring one or more entities into focus it's too it's it's to have a peripheral number of things that need to be brought in to one place so that they can be counted and recognized so he's gonna gather together in one now remember it's one body many members so now this gathering that paul is talking about in ephesians is going to require the members to be formed and brought corralled if you would into one entity now how do we get into this body how do you become a part of this gathering you're baptized by one spirit into this body there's there's no more conflict now why because it's one spirit it's not two it's not five it's not mine it's not yours it's his it's his spirit that takes you and i from where we were to where we need to be i believe that with all my heart but remember it's his spirit so quit fighting his spirit [Music] you're not fighting me this is not a battle against flesh and blood no matter what i say to you or what anybody says to you you're not fighting them it's not a battle of flesh and blood this is a battle against principalities and powers spiritual wickedness in high places what a war and brothers and sisters i'm here to tell you that according to the living god he won and beat the enemy amen he beat the enemy beat him beat him at his own game what is his game death that's all he's got is to try to take you and i to the end as if we had no hope but paul said sorrow not that's those who have no hope because the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with a voice with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first so if we're not gonna hinder and we're gonna be alive and remain then we must have something to do we must be involved in or what we must be defined by amen the lord himself because he's the one doing the descending but it's not the physical corporal body of jesus christ that walked the earth 2 000 years ago yeah it's a voice it's a trump you understand it's an archangel you see it's not the physical corporal body and the reason i want you to see that is because it's still taking place right now i love to say this there are those who are waiting on the coming of the lord but the coming of the lord has been revealed in that he is here so for some he's still coming for you and i he's here but he never stops moving those four living creatures in the book of ezekiel net ezekiel never go backwards yep it's got four faces because no matter which direction they move in the eagle and the ox the lion and the man he's always moving forward and that's what you and i are required to do we can't set still we can't lean back on our laurels we can't say well you know what and i know folks that believe this well i got the holy ghost brother and that's the seal of god and i don't have to do nothing well i read in my bible where once you get the seal of god there is something else to do what is it you must be open something's gotta open you up so that what's contained inside of you can be shared with the dead because the only living hope they got know ye not that ye are written epistles red of all men now you're a walking talking listen now to many people the bible is a biography you know what a biography is it's something written by someone else for someone else but an autobiography is that person themselves writing down about themselves so this is an autobiography to you and me this is not just a biography that's why he said who do men say i the son of man am you don't realize brothers and sisters maybe how simple and how oft-quoted that scripture is but how important it is because once you grasp the true depth of what's going on when jesus said who do men say i the son of man am give me your opinion well some say you're this and some say you're that some say you're elias and some say you're jeremiah or one of the prophets and some say i understand my biography but since i'm the guy she said i want to know who you personally believe that i am who am now what do you think peter do you think peter reached into his pocket got his notebook out hmm well i wrote this down about him and i wrote that down about him and wrote this down about him but through an act a super natural act see that's that's where we lack a lot of times do you realize that when you get a revelation a true revelation of anything in god's word it wasn't the preacher it wasn't the prophet it wasn't the recording it wasn't the reading of it it wasn't even you my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you man you should be feeling good you want to run the aisles if you're getting revelation cause it ain't you a lot of the running the aisles and jumping across the pews is them but i'm talking about when the word of god is eternally internally revealed to you you're like there is a man who could turn on the light amen he's got to be living in my heart because i don't even know where the switch is that's fine but he does he's the master and he makes it happen brother it's not happening to me surrender amen put them hands up in the air and say lord man i haven't gotten nothing this far lord but i'll tell you what i'm gonna keep surrendering you leave that skeleton key on the end of that kite long enough get her up there get her up there he knew that once lightning struck that key on the end of that kite yep a light was gonna come on you just keep them up there keep them hands out there they get weak give them a rest the next time a storm comes they'll run outside get that key up there get that kite in here say lord you can't you have to keep your word and i'm surrendering to you lord with everything that's in me and and of course the little guy you know on the shoulder there the with the pitchfork and the little horns he said yeah right but don't listen to him listen to the other guy over there that says come on come on you can do it come on you can do it i know you can do it keep them hands up in the air it'll happen because he's the god of his word but he's testing you oh test i've been tested so many times i'm about wore out yeah but he wants to see how long yeah you'll wait you know why because we live in an impatient time yeah come on i'm one of you you're like me somebody gets in the way on the road we're in a hurry come on we pull up to the fast food restaurant chick-fil-a is terrible man you back way way back two lines wait wait so get there early you know before you get hungry by the time you get your food you'd be feeling good you understand it's the day we live in everything is impatient we're we're frustrated when the internet speed slows down to one point zillion come on man come on when god says well i got the remedy for that keep your hands up in the air he's so good to us i'm gonna tell you that right now that's right i wanted to read to you out of ephesians also chapter six verse 10 through 17 you want to see something in the air just hang on when you have it say amen i know the brothers put it up there but i sure like the sound of the pages turning and you know i mentioned that to her brother and he came up with some app that made the sound of pages turning they got one i said i think god wants you to do it finally [Laughter] finally my brethren be strong in the lord and then the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that he may be able to stand i mean i if you read this the way i do there's no guarantee here that he may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual witness in high places and don't we know it wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness i want you to notice the armor we're using doesn't look like very good protection depends on what you're fighting this is not a physical battle it's not a flesh and blood battle and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all well that's a guarantee the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god is that right all right i'm going to finish the definition of the word symbol and we're going to go to revelations 5. i read to you the beginning part of it out of the dictionary literally a token of identity verified by comparing its other half something that stands for or suggests something else listen to this one by reason of relationship association convention or accidental resemblance that's right listen now especially a visible sign of something invisible you see where we come in with this body brothers and sisters you may not know it because you bypassed your theophany but this body is a symbol visible symbol of something invisible we represent something else amen the kingdom and that kingdom has a king and that king is jesus watch this last definition an object how many knows what the definition of the word god is an object of worship a symbol is an object or act representing something in the unconscious mind i didn't write this i just got the dictionary out that's been repressed and do you realize brothers and sisters that what's happening to us through the word of god and the hour we live in that there's something back there in the back part well yeah but now it's your mind you see because we all make up a portion of the body of christ and the day that you and i live in is the portion of the body of christ the feed age paul bodies building up higher and higher and higher and of course god sent a prophet so what is a prophet mouth peace oh but that's not all he is he's the ice that's why he's represented by an eagle because he can get way way way up there and look way way down and off across the horizon and say thus saith the lord because i see a vision that's some good eyes now if it don't come to pass don't believe him but if it comes to pass the bible says you listen to those eyes through that mouth that i put in that face of that prophet you with me but guess what it ain't over what's this can these bones live wow hallelujah oh yeah my wife says honey if you don't eat more you're gonna dry up and blow away can these bones live yes there's something on the inside of the believer it doesn't fear death i'll tell you how strong that belief is when jesus said i have the power to lay my life down and pick it up now you know you and i don't have that power that way but if we're in him the power's in us [Applause] it's laying there we don't have to fear death if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you is that right that's a reality brothers and sisters that's not just a statement it's not words in a book to me oh death paul said where is thy stand see paul had that revelation come on it's just brother branham said uh harnessed something harnessed to take us to a better place my brothers and sisters i believe the scripture tells us again that there will be a group of people now can i ask you a question why not you why not me whoa well what if you die tomorrow praise the lord i just got on the bus early but god has an elect select special i like to call them special forces but it's not that kind of battle that he has ordained because he knows they're a part of him so much so that they won't back down oh i'm not talking about picking a fight with your neighbor i'm talking about they won't back down from god's word and its truth and they will slay the enemy at any and every opportunity bite but it's also written listen here devil you come at me with your sticks and your stones but the word of god is sharper more powerful you want to talk about a weapon with this armor but my emphasis in this entire scripture is stand it's like putting your hands up in the air keep them there right until the light comes on and let me tell you something about these sands once the light comes on you don't want to put them down it's not a one-night stand it's not just one bolt of lightning it's the power of god once it strikes the filament of your soul we don't have to be like thomas edison and experiment he's already done it for us it's been proven amen this is ours brothers and sisters because god gave it to us we don't have what it takes without him to possess it but with him he's the creator of the universe of anything and everything now listen you have to believe that amen emphatically absolutely because without that core belief the devil will persuade you any way he can he doesn't care what he has to use he doesn't love you he hates you he doesn't want to see you happy he wants to see you sad and upset downtrodden disappointed unfulfilled that's his job is that how you want to feel i don't really think anybody wants but people get so despondent they see no reason to live that's because they misunderstand life let me tell you what eternal life is and i didn't make up the definition i'm just repeating what the what god's dictionary says eternal life is living for others you start living for others and something will begin to take place inside of you that the devil can't touch now unfortunately because we're creatures of time living for others is also dying for others oh not for their sins but you're expending the valuable life that you have while you're here for a purpose that you don't think is gaining you much ground but when it comes to the judgment amen it won't be a lion that's what we're looking for revelations 5. yes we read it but i want to put emphasis on something if it's okay with you i know that we read this morning uh verses one through four or five i'm going to start at verse five if you got it say amen or when the brothers give it up on the okay you ready listen now and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof i'm going to stop right there and i mentioned this to you who study the message it's the very reason this portion of scripture is the very reason why brother branham was concerned if i used the word distraught it wouldn't be the correct exact definition but he was concerned when he was speaking on what time is it serves or is this the time of the answers or services is the time you know the message i'm talking about he was concerned read it listen to it he had family members that weren't saved he had any any thought that could this be it could could this be is this the sign of the end because he realized that it would be judgment yeah everything would come to a halt and things and people as we know them would be judged based on the moment they came to a halt just like this elder saying behold the lion of the tribe of judah prevailed oh no it's judgment because the lion is dutch guess what he is he's the king not of the earth the beasts see how judgment comes he's the king of beasts and there's an image to the beast and there's the beast and these bodies of flesh without a soul our beasts the animal kingdom and while king david under inspiration killed a lion you try it brother branham himself even said he didn't go lion hunting in africa with a slingshot he had special loads made right so he could be sure and take that thing down you understand where we're at brothers and sisters we're right on the threshold of judgment and the only difference between judgment for humanity for you and i and salvation is what you see because john turned to see a lion thinking this is it behold the great judgment is going to come up before us but john being a type and a representative of the church turned what's the bible say and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb i'm putting emphasis right now as i finish this portion of this message tonight on the lamb standing remember its location location location so brother branham again as i've already repeated to you is john hadn't seen the lamb up to this time he was expecting to see judgment he was expecting to see the king of beasts he was expecting to see lion and he turned and he hadn't seen the lamb before brother brahm said as again i i know i hope you get this he was way back in the eternities where was he well it's defined in the word midst midst the dictionary says location the middle oh but here's where it found its root listen carefully a position what does the prophet of god constantly say the bride is lacking the revelation of her position once she gets in her position he says then she'll be ready for the rapture right i'm just i know i'm just paraphrasing to you what the prophet has said a position of proximity so if he if they say he's in the desert go not forth if they say he's here go no you don't have to do that because he should be within you that puts you in the proximity so this is a position of proximity to the members of a group it's the very reason why brother branham was inspired and compelled by god to use the word eternities you get that it's plural how can there be more than one it's like i say how can there be two more more than one omnipotence when two omnipotent that doesn't even make sense what are they going to wrestle to a tie think about it is it a draw when they get together to box a-l-l all powerful is what omnipotence oh there's nothing there's nothing greater than everything is less than but how can two of those meet the same way this lamb is hidden back in the eternities because he's in the midst of members oh i want you to get this if nothing else he's in the midst john hadn't seen him because he was inside [Applause] his members they don't see jesus when they see you they mock you they want to crucify you they want to impugn you you don't look like jesus to me here turn these stones to bread come on it's the mentality of people well you don't look much like jesus to me no that's because you don't see him he's in the midst of the eternities did you realize brothers and sisters that when you have god living in you you have eternal life what does that make you an eternity this lamb was hidden to the view of all who did not know where he was at amen but god permitted john because the book of revelation is a book of symbols and he wanted to make sure that you and i january the 2nd 2022 had a reference that we could depend on something that we could look into and go i've said it so many times but i i see it more and more myself you know the little boy he'd never seen himself before they went to visit the wealthy aunt she had a mirror in the hallway and he's playing down in the bedrooms and he comes out and the hallway door happened to close what's that he'd never seen one thing or not you and i that mirrors doesn't but if you'd never seen you would think what is that then he figures it out he starts walking towards it and he notices that it's walking towards him and he gets that he moves his head to the left and he moves in and he moves his hands and hey hey that's that's a strange object yeah that's right that's you i i never i never seen that before well brothers and sisters do you realize by the revelation of jesus christ as you begin to look into the mirror of god's word eventually when you bob your head to the left it bobs its head to the left and when you go to the right and when you move your arms and when you begin to stand see having done all to stand stan do you realize brothers and sisters i can read it to you where brother branham tells us that once the lamb reaches that book and gets it in his hand it's over soul's in prison now he says it towards the end of the day it's over yeah so then you would think that we would want to keep him from getting that book in his hands so we could buy some time but what we are failing to recognize is that the reaching for and the reception of what we found out now is not an actual book but a manifest a list of names they have a much greater meaning and that motion of that lamb's standing is the resurrection of life and you and i were dead in sin and trespasses but now we live but not i paul said but christ that liveth in me so brothers and sisters when that last one comes in brother branham tells us the book is closed the book is not available what's in that book is no longer pertinent it does not pertain why because what's in that book is you and i and when the last one gets in position meaning the revelation of that book remember it's not an actual book it's a symbol but the revelation of what's going on in revelation think about it you say how have you ever read revelations 4 so where's the first throne heaven if you've never studied it before it's in revelation chapter 4 and 5 second throne in christ third throne in the heart of man is that right do you have a scofield bible you don't have to have one i'm just asking revelations 4 it says things which shall be hereafter the seven seals and then introduction to the throne in heaven but the third throne is in the heart of man you start reading now remember this is a book of symbols you start reading in revelations 4 and you go wow that's tremendous yeah did you realize where that's taking place in your heart but it's because it's in symbol form it looks like well that's a crazy wild thing but god knows what he can do with you and you may not realize it but when he comes in and you are caught up because of him in heavenly places in christ jesus you get to see things hereafter not everybody gets to see them only the bride of christ is in this catching away now a lot of people will say well wait a minute now brother branham said from revelations chapters one through three is the church ages yes he did i believe that amen but that's not all he said watch what else he said in the book of daniel now in the third chapter the church was gone up but now redemption is to be revealed watch the word brother branham uses how the church was redeemed the revelation of what taken place during the church age see the church is gone so he is now showing in the fifth chapter it is to those who are involved in how he did it it doesn't pertain to everybody else it pertains to a group a select members number of people who have looked in the mirror of his word and says mama that's me that's me i see that that's me mama what taken place how he sealed the church off i'm still reading the revelation of his name water baptism using his name eternal life no eternal hell serpent seed eternal security all the great doctrines predestination of the church that was revealed to the church he's showing how he done it so that's the reason why it's important for you and i to go beyond the church ages but we don't throw them out they're the conduit they're the vehicle the way that the life is moving through the church but the life has a destination what is that destination the kernel the seed its original form you know that pillar of fire we have a picture of of did you know that was jesus it's the same pillar of fire paul saw amen i'm jesus he said whom thou persecutest all right it was a pillar of fire amen he said i came from god i go back to god brothers and sisters you may not realize it in closing but that's what's being revealed to you and me you see we couldn't make the statement emphatically because we bypassed something but god permitted us to bypass it so that he could express the attributes that were bottled and closed up in him but wanted to get out now that those attributes have been expressed guess what we want to go home we want to go home if you've been saved you know it that's how if you're saved and you know it say amen amen if you're saved and you know it say amen well if you're saved and you know it then your life will surely show it so then if you're saved and you know it say amen please stand we go on for hours i'm gonna stop right there god is good all the time that's right he sure is god's word is got no ending so we gotta stop somewhere is that right amen i think i'd like to sing and then i'll give it to you brother the let's see the name of the lord is a mighty strong tower and the righteous run into it and guess what happens we're saved is that right we're saved amen [Music] oh yeah the righteous run into it and they are safe well the name of the lord [Music] [Applause] what we're going to sing [Music] the name of the lord

if you're sick you need to come to church this is where you need to get prayed for all right exactly so we had to i think we had to back off a little bit because the cove didn't but but uh still though really this is the place for prayer this is the place where have you ever felt bad and just come on to church i'll guarantee you 99 of the time you feel a lot better that's right when you're here now you may feel worse when you get to the house but i've come up here with headaches and body aches and i know chris has two and and you just say man i don't know how i'm gonna get through this and then you just forget about it and and you get the anointing comes and then you know you it doesn't even bother you anymore man so you know what this is where i'd like to stay then because you know what brother chris this is what's going to happen when the alive and remain get changed we're not going to have bad days hey man we have bad days now but we're not going to have bad days when body change comes mom downstairs i'm not sure is [Applause] when you break the airwaves something's got to happen chris when two omnipotents meet that's right somebody preached that one time here oh okay but when two but you got to speak didn't brother brown say we need to be in a speaking condition right sure faith comes by hearing we've hear we've heard for years and years and years now it's time for us to like i said before let what's inside of us out right now quit binding it let it out i don't care if it's the devil you want him out amen like i said before i don't i want everybody to feel comfortable except the devil i do not want him to feel comfortable in this building i want him to feel like he needs to leave because when you feel uncomfortable what do you do you leave amen that's why joanna and chris are leaving tomorrow brother george smith said though three days you know visitors are like fish after three days let's kick them out but we eat fish last night i'm sorry whoops so anyway but we love them and we enjoy them i know you do you feel real comfortable chris feels real comfortable bringing the message to you and and that's the testimony of brother dale how he tells us how to treat people treat people like brothers and sisters amen not some second rate first rate even though we might be second team okay second choice you know there was one time that henry aaron when he i believe the first time he went to bat he struck out 1959 with the milwaukee braves i think the first up baddie struck out he didn't quit though he went on to hit 714 home runs and be one of the best ball players that ever lived so we all start somewhere right yeah man we all start somewhere so we're starting this new year uh brother bob will be speaking for us wednesday night and then uh we should be having regular service uh remember me they did my psa i hadn't got the results back but i'm gonna have a heart cath next tuesday not this coming but this coming tuesday they're gonna do all my blood work and all that stuff so just pray that everything's good and okay um we've got we've got a power that we're not tapping into we're not tapping into it but but we can like brother chris just said he said it's already here we don't have to have it coming the whole world's looking for something to come and that's the devil he keeps pushing it looking for something to come oh the bible says oh we've heard that since the beginning of time you know the lord's coming we've heard that since the beginning oh he's going to do this since the beginning of time they told brother brown they said days and miracles are passed too late too late too late no news is done out word's done out we already been filled with the holy ghost so blue devil come on but i gotta have uh yes mom's got to see what she's allergic to so um they'll be pricking her all over her body and she'll be looking like she's got the month i hope not that way she that because means that she's allergic to everything so hey man so let's just remember that and also remember brother jt pageant um he did have a stroke mini stroke yes the blood pressure and he still has a little droop in his in his face but you know what that's nothing to god all these words that we put out cancer coveted god's just like going what are you talking about nothing to me so let's just put it in god's hands brother pageant's got a group of people that he that he needs to lead so we need to pray that those people get fed right he has no other pat and no other preacher in his church so we just need to pray that they that brother pageant gets better and he goes right on in and they don't miss a beat hey man i had to postpone today's service and a lot of them are having to do that because of covet or because the pastor's sick somebody called me yesterday oh brother joe forney was talking to us he said it seems like look what satan's doing he's attacking the ministry because see he knows if he's got us but you know what he just don't understand that we've been taught as chris said i can't live your life dad can't live your life the greatest gift you can give is you live the life right well see then satan can't get to you through me come on exactly come on satan can't get to you through me because satan uses people to get to you right well when you're sealed in he can't get to you he's sealed out that's right amen oh and remember brother dutch scott he um has coveted and he had brother um david gavin preaching for him today so let's just remember all these as we travel brother chris and sister joanna will be leaving going to bella forni's um on wednesday night right and then they're going to visit i think brother gene williams be here for a couple of days and then fly back out vote uh we prayed them here let's pray them home and man i don't like that no i don't want to do that i want to do that ground the plane send you back to my house i know that i know that i enjoy being there too but i enjoy being in my own bed you all know that amen so let's bow our heads oh i'm sorry brother danny i mean sure come on right of course he went right on and that's great he didn't give him time to get up here but i stood back and i don't claim it from here okay and my hip was killing me amen [Applause] god does not have distance he ain't a creature of time and he ain't a creature a distance that's right so what do you need this for oh okay all right you ready yeah dear lord i do not have to tell this brother what these are for he knows what they're for he knows that we've seen cancer heal many different things and he's a standing testimony that these prayer cloths if they're placed on a body and believe that demons have to flee that's right and father we pray lord as we see that he's got something for his daughter lord we pray that you just protect your father that you'll give her strength in what she's doing lord and these prayer cloths will do exactly what they're meant to be that's right we
