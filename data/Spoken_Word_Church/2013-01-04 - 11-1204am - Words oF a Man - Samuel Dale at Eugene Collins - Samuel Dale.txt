with us here guide us then keep us Lord let your light shine in our lives bless this little place your lord fill it up with people oh yes because we believe you thank you we commit it to you now in Jesus name Exodus 32 kind of where we were at last night on the information these things and then we'll just continue on the thought this was Moses now when he was coming down off the mountain after the you know the children of Israel that made the golden cage and the things look what he said verse 30 and he came to pass on tomorrow that Moses said unto the people yes send the great standing now I will go up unto the Lord free adventure I shall make an atonement for your sin and Moses returned unto the Lord and said oh these people have sinned to Great sin and have made them gods and gold yet now if that will forgive their sin and if not like me I pray thee out of thy book which thou has written and the Lord said unto Moses whosoever shall Ascend against me him will I blocked out of my book therefore go now lead the people under the place which I have spoken unto thee behold my angel shall go before thee nevertheless in the day when I visited I will visit their sin upon them you may be seated blessing for the meaning of the word now I asked you there last night to reconsider a call we think about an atonement we read here Moses said you know pre-adventure I'll go up and make an atonement well we know that something happened because God did not kill the children of Israel right then and sure we know he dealt with them later in the doings but he was still taking them on toward the promised land which was his promise to them yes but you know the question I've asked is what atonement did Moses make what atonement did he make was it a cave was it a goat was it a on a you know a terminal a pigeon whatever what was the thing that he made now into considering that I want us to think about Hebrews 1. where did it says in Sandra times in diverse manners God speak in times of passion in which the word is by there which would be in the prophets you know what happened in these last days spoken unto us in his son so we went through last night looking at the Christ and seeing the Christ of the Bible and uh those Prophets what I want you to think about for a minute is that uh how did Abraham come up when they were in the slaughter of the Kings and and he said I'll give you 10 percent why did he say it like that you know you don't ever think about those things as you're reading along in in your studies and things and see that's what we're set for we're to jog your memory about it but see I believe that Abraham picked that thought up from God yes it is brother why didn't he say 20 80 90 or whatever he should have given him every bit of it you know but see then why did he say 10 and then we turn around and why do we pay a 10 time you know it's not an accident or a daughter a good idea you know I believe those Prophets could enter into so much until they would receive the very mind of God and he would speak through them just as Moses would go up and bring down the Commandments in the banks and just that he could write Genesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy you know that he could write all of those books from what he received from God on the mountain yes he could tell what happened in Genesis you know you said well it was just you know what had happened was it was just a lot of of people you know and they still do that in a lot of places that they have people that are that are really to remember what goes on right yeah and you know there's a big word for that but they they keep up with it and they're lineages and things they keep up with it they don't have to write it down they keep up with it from memory right and that's wonderful that's that's fine but see there wasn't anybody back there to have the memory of to write or what happened in Genesis so Moses got from God you know what God wanted us to read today yes all right so he he brought it down and he really picked up the thought see him run around and sit in and see a book and said it was first said it was gone stop he said it's not the word yet he said he gives it to Moses and said it becomes Moses to stop he said it's still not the word he said that Moses Goes Forth and speaks it he said now it's the word all right so then that word is the greatest of all things that we could think of and I remember when we were reading last night this time the two together that we were reading about that Peter said about Jesus that are in John you know said thou Hast the words of eternal life what about a man being given the word of eternal life no the Bible says it and your Prophet said it that you know that we were able to impart eternal life he said now here's the way to do it he told us how to do it he said well I'll just go out and just give it to anybody want to no it wouldn't want to happen he said here's how to do it he said you take Acts 2 38. where it says repent every one of them be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ he said now you can talk about imparting eternal life right why because you're giving them the God's word all right see through those prophets would as I said they would pick up the thought of God then they would translate that down to the human and like who is it naming that said you know he saw chariots Jocelyn in the streets uh running like lightning and things you know torches and all well see he was looking down and seeing out here on these interstates of of Buicks and Oldsmobiles and Cadillacs running into each other and running up down the highway with the lights on you know and things but he couldn't say those words because those words were not in the human vocabulary at the time and he didn't know what to call him so he called him chariots Jocelyn in the streets you know and if you're asking what it is used to all I know to tell you is it was some kind of a moving object yes and it was going and had lights on it and stuff like that see because it was if that was the point of what it is right but see get the point now and then we'll get into the main thought those prophets would pick up the thought of God and they would actually bring it down to us and that's the way the Bible was written all right yeah and and they would receive that thought yes and they put it into words all right then see we do believe them now that we have the word of God yes right right we believe the Bible we have today is the word of God that would be you know if it was any way of bringing it any other way then God would have chose to done it that way because he he done the perfect way of doing it and he brought it Down To Us by the prophets sometime all right now we'll get on down to where we are more in in a little while but I want you to think on something with me that we know that when Moses said this to God you know he said block my name out too he meant it yes it is amen what he was doing and he was willing to put himself on the line yes Paul said I I would be a Castaway If my people could be saved oh listen now here's the words that wrote around me he said you're not worthy of living until you're willing to die paraphrase in that's right and to die for others it's easy to maybe die for somebody that's good for you to you you know doing something but what about your enemies we're supposed to love our enemies we say well no we we just can't love our enemy well why not Jesus loved his enemies and he prayed for them that despitefully used him and everything else all right so then as as we're looking at it get the thought in your mind of God actually using man yes to transmit his thoughts down into word form that could be read yes see he would do it in in mysterious ways and we know that that when God met you know Moses started to burning bush he told him to take off your shoes because you're standing on the Holy Ground well now what I want you to watch is progressiveness because that's what I like to do I like to take something here and then see it progress like we did last night and we saw the Christ we saw him back there we saw him create we saw him bring everything into it just we saw him through the Old Testament we saw him then coming into Jesus upon the Earth then we saw him coming into you and I to be Christ in you the hope of glory I like to progress like that so we hear a lot said and people use it in in all about Moses and at the burning bush and God said take off your shoes well you know that was good and he saw him and he heard him and he gave him his Commission well now if you'll get over into Joshua you'll find that Joshua then receives his Commission Moses received the commission Joshua received the commission stray from God but you know what I like about Joshua you read during Joshua you know that as I said we say a lot about Moses in the burning bush but Joshua was standing out there one day you know walking around and he looks over and he sees this man standing there well he naturally he knew he wasn't one of them so he just grabbed his sword you know yes he said are you Forest are you for the enemy well this man spoke back to him he said I'm done on either side I've come to take over amen all right he met the captain of the host right right you know Moses so God in a burning wish and heard a voice but Joshua met a man do you see we're probably higher yes progression going up that's why I like to look at the Bible yes sir God if the man that was standing there go Moses take your shoes off Moses at the burning bush to take your shoes off all right see when he met in other words he saw a man Moses didn't get to see the man he later saw the back part of a man but he was not capable of seeing the man but here stand the man absolutely he said I'm the captain of the Lord's Holy Spirit he saw the Christ standing in a human vessel why can't we look then and see it keep climbing until one day the Bible said no man can see God that means seemed like with the eye of natural understanding because one day a man walked upon this Earth that he said if you seen me you sing the father the verse took the same one that met Moses at the burning bush that Moses finally saw the black part all right then you see that same man was the one that Joshua met that was the captain of the Lord's host the then here he stands upon Earth and he said do you sing the father they said well where's he at he said he's standing here talking to you all right so you've got greater and greater and greater all right now but it has to get greater because you and I must see time back to last night we must see by the new birth that we see God in Greater measure than even if we were standing looking at him absolutely right yes sir even if you're standing back and literally seeing him I mean you could walk up and shook his hand you know the Bible said he was seen of over 500 Brethren asked for his resurrection right but worse than 380 that didn't make it to the upper room right right there's only 120 minutes and the others have seen him answering right yes see God well look right into his word because Satan can impersonate right right he can come to you as an angel that's right you can come to yourself and you see but I'd rather have it in the word amen because Satan can't impersonate the word we try to do everything he tries to twist it and turn it but he can't be the word prophet of God said he can't be the Holy Ghost but now you be the great anointing that goes out in anoints and all kinds of stuff but he can't bring the word word for word all right because that word means more than you think to just hold it is the old black brother said you know I blame it from the camera to kill her he said and I even believe the camera goes to God Holy Bible right now see that's where we we should believe it and cherish the fact that we are in the winding up so we are in the more positive state of seeing things when this prophet of God came in the last days to bring us the message because I see him last night see he brought us the word let me turn alive right see people saw and talk to a man that God could use to speak squirrels into existence and all kind of things and stormed out consistently but where are those people that actually saw him mulatto turned against it force of healing I've got some of the magazines that they had in the 50s that you know they were saying I'd run around saying pray that God sent a prophet I mean they were saying that in the magazine and then printing that brother random was traveling the world and that 30 000 people healed and went Oliver called in the magazine yeah but yet they're saying fast and pray for God to send the problem I never did understand somebody didn't ask some questions I know I'm a Dundee and I understand that but I don't understand when everybody hears brother random talking you know and he said that we've never had a man by the name of H.A.M you know I was still this nice days and said we got a Billy Graham g-r-a-h-a-n so that's six letters but said now Abram said he had to have his name changed he said he wound up being Abraham and he said that's 700. and said no you know everybody could look at him talking about Billy Graham but I wonder why somebody didn't walk up in and say what is your name oh yeah William seven letters marry me seven letters Brown 7-Eleven so you can match that one it was back down with the 7-Eleven and you know that his name was not Bradham his daddy changed the name you know the story if you don't let me know it hold on I'll be glad to get it his daddy actually it was Greyhound his daddy added the end to it making it brown see because it wouldn't have matched up because his daddy had to change his name well I thought it was our daddy had to give us a new name change her name before it's any good but my point is which is the greatest would you rather have this day God just stand here you know in a human fashion that you could talk to you can ask him questions you know and you'd rather have that or as you rather have his word that would answer all of our questions right which is the greatest he said what I I see if you say well I'd rather be in his presence well you know because in his presidency might have to kill us you know that he can't stand in the presence of sin problem you said well I want God standing here I don't want God standing here right that was the perusian years ago or Garcia the big words they used that they wanted his presence I said I offended people one night by saying it in the ministry fellowship meeting we read and I said I don't want him standing here beside him if he did he might kill me I'm gonna do something wrong and I said but if I've got him inside of me I think about it did he take care of all the problems see what am I doing take it the word to his eyes form to see the value of the word that's the main thing that I wanted you to see yes sir the value of the word and even to my people they know I didn't approach these things there's a way that even at home so I'm asking them to think about it the value of the word how great it is for us to be able to read the Bible and it reads the same letters and things because I always liked and you know I didn't know this girl when brother Brown come along I didn't use it someone said you like the Thompson Chain but that's all right but he used the Scofield bible I always like the Scofield bible even when I was in the bathroom and things like that I I I I I wanted to Schofield Bible I like them all right see then that doesn't mean that the Scofield is only one it just means the one alive yeah because I I got used to it if you know the story in your Scoville Bible it doesn't matter if it's this big or if it's that big everything is on the same side of the page and I'm just a dummy I give you some things being on the left what is that word where's the school teacher at the heifer um Autistic or what is the word that you don't like changes well that's that's the way it is I don't like changes I like and if you see mine you'll see that I got marks on on those you know you know like that because I believe that we have the word now not to Scofield bible I'm talking about the King James version and I read all the other versions too I read a lot of them I have one book that are valued highly it's got 26 translations in it and I use it a lot to compare the things that I'm looking at all right but see the Bro the prophet said we now have God's word to where even the these the ands and the books is in the right place all right so evident that this was what God wanted before the world this was the book he wrote before the world yes all right absolutely and in writing that book before the world he transmitted it down to mankind all right it took thousands of years if you know the story behind the King James version that they took like I forgot 15 powers or 16 pairs of of men and they gave each one of them a scripture to translate and they would put them in Paris two year two year two here two here and they when they came back they all had to have the same exact wording or understanding and then they would write it down he's showing you the Holy Spirit could lead man to do those things now what about the words of a man then I hope the background of that part gets in there that we can understand that the value of words we use words to express ourselves in that reform the language is all over you different wordings but still we can communicate they take a little while but I mean like it was in Brazil when I was trying to think sister Cesar for for letting us come and being there with them and I called her a help me it doesn't say help name Genesis uh people read that doesn't say it they made Adam help me m-e-t don't say mate you know all right we're going to make it be too many it doesn't matter but to me it's a different word when you translated that to Portuguese it came out m-e-a-t oh I was calling her a hamburger but we got it all together and we had a good life at it but still irregardless you can translate words the word that you come to a place of having a great understanding all right now the Bible says at the words of a man we'll get to that in a minute but that's what I want you to think about Moses goes up before God and he said now Lord if you kill them kill me too all right now we know if we read or we're talking about it last night if you want these it's a one of the souls in prison uh trying to look paragraph like 118 117 118 119. run around said it was the spirit of Christ in Moses he said I I couldn't understand how that Moses could tell God a better way to do it but he said it was the spirit of Christ of Moses then in the message Look Away to Jesus he said it said it was Moses was Christ standing for the people all right now was that Moses that God was backing away from or was it the Christ that was in there that was dealing by way of an anointing back then because they did not have the new birth they couldn't get the new work in the Old Testament right and Moses then could seemingly tell God a better way of doing things but run around said I wondered about death and he said until I found out it was Christ in Moses all right then he could see that it was Christ's heaven reminding God all right so now what was the atonement that Moses made he didn't take an animal it was his word it was his word and to help you with it let's go over to what numbers let's go over to numbers the 14th chapter to pick up a dollar see how powerful the words of a man is you know there's a lot of people in jail because the words of a man there's people been set free from jail because of the words of man you know you know what I'm saying mankind that's a female or a male or is this mankind our words are powerful the tongue can kill or it can set free but this man Moses no when he comes over here he does something a little different because this is another story this is when you're coming over to Katie's barnia getting close all right where the other was at the time that the you know the the Motors one of them got the word to come down yes all right and the golden cake now look what he says look at numbers 14. we'll start reading about verse 13. and Moses said unto the Lord let the Egyptians shall hear it because he planned on destroying them but read the background he's going to destroy them for what you've done we said in Moses said unto the Lord then the Egyptians shall hear it for thou brought us up his people in thy might from among them and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land for they have heard that thou Lord art among his people that thou Lord are seen face to face and that Dr Cloud standeth over them and that thou goest before them by daytime in a pillar of a cloud in a pillar of Fire by night now what he's doing he's reminding God we'll get to it the same all right reminding God of his word okay so now the people were so scared of these things that were happening right when you you get over to uh what is it to Davis born here now or when they went into uh Canaan you remember the two spies they went in and you remember the woman told them to hit him see we heard what you've done and said we had no more fight left in US read your Bible God said we had no more fight left in us when we heard what God had done yes all right so he showed him all of that but look what he's telling me now if Thou shalt kill all these people as one man verse 15 that the Nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak yes what what they'll say in other words you won't be a spirit of it if you go out and Kill Them All verse 16 because the Lord was not able to bring these people into the land which he's wearing to them therefore he has slain them in the wilderness now Moses is reminding God and I'm quoting right around that you said you would take them in and says now you come out here with him and go and kill him and said the people around here is not going to be afraid of you because they'll say you was able to bring them out but not able to take them in all right now what about a man that could tell God those words and you know God listens to him because you can read on down and find the things and look what he says verse 19 pardon not be seen Steve the iniquity of these people according to the greatness of thy mercy as thou has forgiven this people from Egypt even until now verse 21 22 said he'd done done it 10 times the one and the Lord said I have pardoned according to Thy Word he pardoned the children of Israel according to his word according to that word Moses gave the people of Israel God's word and God honored that word so we see the atonement that was being made back over in the other in Exodus was the words of a man reminding God now I'm quoting brother Brown and he said God ordained Moses for the job and said he could not go over him he said if he commissions you to do something it will be done because he ordained you foreign he said Moses could go then before God and tell God them people will say that you was able to bring him out but you wasn't able to take him in he said they won't be afraid of you but the words of a man Moses's words talking to God which we know it was Christ and Moses reminding him right it would be Christ in Moses reminding God of what they were saying so he said at Thy Word I have pardoned the people at that word throw the atonement that Moses made was God's word that he reminded him he said you said you would take them in you made a promise and I'm quoting right around him he said you made a promise and we're standing on your promise I've got these in my briefcase out in the car if you want you made the promise and we're reminding you of your promise you know brother Ryan said it doesn't make God mad for you to remind him of his promise when you say buy Stripes I'm Healed you're reminding of his problem when you say if I believe in my heart confess with my mouth I shall be saved then I'm reminding of what he said when I read Malachi 4 behold I send you Elijah Elijah I'm reminding of his promise he couldn't write something in the Bible and not keep it because it was a promise to somebody that's right that's why I was giving it to you their life not saying that when I would read the Bible and say you'll be there with your offspring that was a promise to me so I remind him of his promise and the children came I was standing up in a church in Tennessee one time and speaking long on that line and his brother's two sons were lost and out in the world and I looked down at him I said if you believe what I say I'll give you your two kids you said no you can't do that but I can't do that I agree with you no problem but if Christ comes through me and speaks it what's the difference you know what you want to call him one of them's a preacher in his church the other is a deacon the song leader they both come to the Lord see so it must have been true what was said yes sir that doesn't make me anything that doesn't make Moses anytime I'm not glorified man I don't even try to Glory Drive run around them no no but I said God spoke through the man I give honor to the god that spoke at the words of a man thank you it's the same time reading you're going over in Joshua and you'll find Joshua when he was out there and the battle was going pretty hot and it was coming down to the end of the day and he knew that if if they scattered that they would they would have trouble you know and they'd have to fight a lot of them again come to get back together during the night and they're out of trouble so he just not even praying not even you know he just turned around he said Son stand still yes he did amen glorious Moon you hang over there and the Bible said that it was never before don't misunderstand me all right do you see a car coming towards you A big old truck on your side of the road where you are and you ain't got nowhere to go that's right you don't have time to stop hold a truck wait a minute put everything off give me an hour to pray and I believe in praying right well do you know what brother writer said he said Joshua didn't have to pray he said God he was prayed up before the foundation Joshua was prayed out before the foundation of the world comes in God's mind it was what was needed he was going to a meeting up in Tennessee one time in a in a van and we're on the whole thing didn't even remembered it it's called Sam's gout he might have been in the van with us that day now I'm driving brother Tom far Bush's bam and uh the old Rover just I mean like this sheer Rock up and down you know and we started in a curve and I looked and there was a tractor-trailer coming and the tractor the front end of it was already in my side so now if he kept coming you know where the trailer was at he was closer over uh well all at once we just run them through the brother looked at me and he said how did you do that I said the same way I get a sermon that's what I told her I said the same way brother I get a sermon yes I said I just put it in there and said God take care of it right because they would know where to go yeah we were all in my side of the road we're just sure enough yes amen Gloria did you see Hallelujah I believe in praying stay prayed up then when Trouble Comes yes you don't have to worry about praying you don't understand we got to call a prayer meeting you just say it move on that's what Joshua he just said Son stands for you yes yes we know that was Christ named Joshua but it was Joshua the man you can't separate the man when it was Moses saying blood out my name he meant it when Paul said I wouldn't be a cash away from my people yeah absolutely and if you happen in it God wouldn't honor it right right see God looked down and said you're right Moses thank you Father if I go over you I'm about to get you first because you're in the way but get the point now what about that Moses reminding God of his word what about you tonight jump down a little quick down to this end time what about this prophet in the nice days that took God in his word and spoke fly I spoke with squirrels stormed out in existence cancer off of his life or a growth of his wife um salvation the sister had her out his two children the storm that was there and spoken out of existence who was that was that a man yeah it was a it was a man that had took God's word and believed he walked in that realm the word that he could bring God on the scene in front of a congregation he said you bring me 24 of your worst cases and I'll guarantee you healing for every one of them now they've never been a man on Earth sitting down outside the Lord Jesus Christ how close he stood in the realm and he was living so if we see it with Christ in Moses Christ in Joshua Christ and Abraham crashing off on them and then we see that Christ walked 2000 years ago upon the shores of Galilee why can't we see that that same Christ we were talking about last night was dwelling in a man to bring us the word Luther and then were Christians right but there was no change in the body back in those periods of time because there was no word to change it that's right the atonement had to be made do we think of atonement as only being animals offer you'll find one time there in the scripture I think it's number 16 I believe 47. that Moses told Aaron because the plagues were falling and Moses told Aaron she takes the sensors from cold off the fire and run among the people and making a drama with an animal offer but it was God's ordained way God of ordained those pictures and those things the prophet said if he's ordained you for a job oh do the job and believe it he said Riverdale how can you preach him about to worry that even you go on the internet and and challenge the people come and show me where I'm wrong but if I'm wrong and you show me where I'm from then I can be held right absolutely number one I can be held but if I'm right I ain't gonna have to worry about it you wanna rap you ain't gonna show them but that ain't gonna convert nobody but I preach what I believe that's right I believe the same God as I said last night that created this world is the same God living in You by the baptism amen I believe the same God it said let that be was the same God that was standing in a man yes sir that said God don't you come over if you get anything done you're gonna come over me he didn't walk down into a higher form if you followed me while ago yes Moses into burning bush did you follow me he had seen things all right he saw the back of a man but Joshua as it progressed yes Joshua saw the man the captain of the Lord's host then one day that man walked through the source of God and that man come back in the baptism of the Holy Ghost to give a new birth that's what I'd rather be over here in the New Testament oh yes then to be back there yes I'd love to have been there to see the partner of the Red Sea I'd love to be there you'll see all of those signs wouldn't you but I'm down here at the end of all times I'm down here to see that God is going to honor a man yes sir divorce he said on there he said I say unto you but we're not the same thing Moses remember and said it said Moses gave a Grace of marriage and the Lord absolutely we're not the same one if the Apostle Paul said not the Lord but I say right amen see it was picking up the thought of the mind of God yes this is God's word or God in here he said but when the Holy Spirit comes in and picks up that cow and transmits it out to you it becomes a living reality of the word of God we have read in the Bible we'd be changed in a moment between club and I right but the man that said that went by the grave my prediction you read over in Hebrews without us they cannot be made perfect well Paul said that yes you know what one day Paul went to the ground right now he's one in the ground saying without somebody about I can't be made perfect right so that means complete right for a full age or brought forth but you see at the words of a man the sons Stood Still at the words of a man God honored that word at the words of a man God in his Christ days through a prophet has spoken the things of God that were hidden before the world ever begun to bring out the Mysteries the secrets to where we could be changed we're building on the words of a man amen well then you don't know what the Bible says the Bible says follow me Paul did as I thought I cry exactly what the Bible says when he says the white horse rider was the Holy Ghost then when he turned around and said he wouldn't have had it in the Antichrist we had to swap over with it all right absolutely but when he said it was the Holy Ghost that wasn't right we can't follow that even though that was the words of a man that had a great understanding and listened they was nobody in the world everybody understand what nobody means that means there ain't nobody it ain't the good word we're in the southern part we use that yeah that means nobody period nobody could correct her around first Larkin before brother Brown said to white horse rider was the Holy Ghost I mean was the Antichrist Murphy and it's right um but he wasn't a prophet he made a lucky guess or are a pre-figure of the truth and when brother Brown come out and said those things there's things he said that we know he corrected but if he didn't correct it there's no human mortal on Earth can correct the prophet that's right one because he's God's mouthpiece you understand what it says that in Hebrews there and has spoken to us in his son run around the Son of God and God spoke through that son brother colleges or Son of God God can come down and sleep through him to bring us the truth all right when are we going to accept it that way the prophet of God said it's the hardest thing in the world yet one man to believe enough this is true just order to get one man to believe you know I'm not asking you to believe me I never have asked my family I'll never ask my wife sitting there she can tell you you ask my kids I've never asked them to believe what I believe I asked them to do the same thing I asked the congregation to do and ask God if that's right it goes in that way you're not built on a man you're building on God's word and atonement Moses made with his own words and God looked down and says they got back off he goes over to the others as expression and he says it will be said Lord you know my brother brought around and said he said Moses was reminding God of his word he said that's what we must do remind him of his word at the words of a man you and I stand today very interest the other day very and I told the people before got to that point I said most of you standing here today oh your opportunity of Salvation to this man because that was back in the early days even the truck driver and even when they found out about right around me and we started driving he'd go through Indiana you know and stop over and pick up tables he didn't come back with me for a lot of churches didn't agree with it and and I know that they did it they'd sit in the school to tapes through the seeds to each other you know in the churches because they had been begin to some of them believe in the Reynolds prophets well see at the words of mine somebody helped you nobody guided you to Jesus Christ right somebody led us to the Lord some night that God used you said well can you use people he used Baylor and you know the veil of prophecies right here in this book he used Baylor by those prophecies right here written in the book he said well thank you much problems you used to dumb donkey to tell them bailand the truth he used a rooster to grow it could be right Peter what he said when I first heard of the message what about tears was a little problem but the the farthest part of believing one God no problem and I was toying with the point of the water baptism and I was in the Baptist church and we had a Baptist well thankfulness we were having a Revival and this guy came in and he preached and he preached all you do in the word me do all in the name of Jesus Christ that's it the people in the church they started praying in Jesus Christ but to me I went home and told Brother Moses I'm ready for the water because I've seen it all you do is worthy so God used the man to bring the truth but do we believe it today that's why you got a lot of people around the message today they're sitting home listening tapes they're in churches and by listening to the tables and things like that because they don't trust the thoughtful Ministries I didn't call myself God called me to the office I can call myself he said your non-spiritual gifts works in the church is not predestinated that's how much you separated but you see if God's Got A Deal I was preaching on Perfection into church perfect tonight even made the statement I said reverence said if if you got a question in your mind God will bring somebody on the pool if you didn't answer that question the brother walked in there and handed me a note and he wrote two or three weeks before then what's the difference in perfect imperfection I voted over there was the title of the circle he'll do it yes you said with them brother we believe everything you say nope I'm human but if I tell you God said you'd go to the bank because I'm not going to tell you until I know he said I can get a thought he'd be a good dog you know those 400 Prophets until we're facing there they had a good thought that's our man they're eating our food let's go get it good job but it wasn't what God Said so God said to the man said go on right yeah he said I saw you scared the Old King looked around there and he said put him in the prison and feed him the bread of water and the sorrow you know red water he said when I returned and I'll deal with you the old Prophet looked over at him he said if you return it all God didn't speak to me and you know what he didn't return to the words of a man you know that sister hey right couldn't couldn't totally grasp him evenly when brother Brown told her about her two boys she couldn't grasp it because that was a new part of his ministry where I say unto them see Jesus never did say to us in the Lord right show me the bible where jesus then said thus said the Lord now he was the Lord see what he said what I see him today right so wrote around and said to her I say unto thee I'll give you a boy and she must have evidently struggled a little bit about believing it totally because he turned around he said sister had it right back just saith the Lord yes she accepted but she knew when he said thus saith Lord yes he did it didn't get what to Ashley but your prophets would say thus saith the Lord but from Jesus up on this side he didn't have any time but around I had to come and show the ministry of the ministry of the Lord Jesus but he had to show it as a human bark so he would come and say he said that's thus saith the Lord you see one day it come to him to say I say under this time same word did he say he said when receivers broke the Bible become a brand new book that didn't become a different one though energy brand new book I said well I will become a new book to you not to see something different oh yeah and do so big ones that have done a virtue and all these other River Jordan they got the new book s we just remember there can't be something new that doesn't compare with the old all right if the old New Testament didn't compare with the Old Testament to show the same God it would be something wrong absolutely that's why I hear a book of Maccabees and all these lost books of Eden were not put in the Bible because they didn't compare what do you think about the words of a man because that man I'm talking about the Lord Jesus Christ the same one that spoke the world into existence the same one it's stood there and said unless you believe that I am he you will die in your sins the same one has come over here in the last days to speak through you and I speak and go forward pray for us at home we struggle we have our problems with everybody else you may have a small group but just remember when you get a bigger group you got bigger problem I never had no problem with it I don't never complain about my job I just do the job right amen I just tell them I said if you don't like the way I do it the first day of January you just vote you another preacher again you know take care of that I'm out of trouble yes but it's a word for money listen to the preachers that preached to him and see if in comparison to the Bible that's right she's the comparison of the Prophet speech amen now I have a little abundant I've always told people the name say well who are you but if you don't listen to what I'm saying you know the way I check a doctor now see where to write or not is not public quotes they can give you program Enterprise if you tell me something that the Bible said is contrary to the way that I got born again I can't accept it and that's how sure I am about my new birth that my new birth is always compared with the Bible and I was two years in this message you know said last night before I in any ways that I had the baptism when I would have done I didn't say it just because I come into the message and I left the Baptist and I could tell you what the prophet said but one day something happened I had a new birth how do I read murder transformation to see if it's compared for money or if they don't compare there's something wrong maybe it's me I said with my new birth so did I say last night what is the new word Christ in you the hope of glory mankind down through time in Heavenly hope of a change in the body they've all called we're going to get us a music that's right you see then when this Prophet came it began to change and Mankind even today and even well-known preachers in this Mission are still saying that we're going to get us a new body well I can't understand that when I read in the Bible that Jesus said they originally raised if anybody would do a new one it would have been me and wouldn't it oh no we'll take it now Hallelujah that's the only thing he retained if you saw Jesus today with blood all over him in a male Prince and all in his head and I tell you you didn't see Jesus because he only retained the one thing the nail prints in his hands and I believe when we get to Glory he'll still have it right because that would always be there to remind me of my salvation let's stand together well back on these things pray for our ship home good evening we need the Lord appreciate you putting up with us sitting and listening yes in a good contradiction as I said last night I've preached in big churches and I feel no more the spirit of God than us without fear factor of this spirit of God being within a little group little thing of talking about the Lord and fellowshipping and thank you we see I know the people here I'm looking at a Congregation of 500 not on the one in the world should I but I know most of you is probably all of your life just about it facing the kids tonight you know I appreciate brother Collins and it stands in the word for the dog would always be with him until his church up the next one of the Lord

this is always going to take really does help the Lord you know you might as well and turn around go back just talk you know foreign if you just see me when I'm taking it look at how much it is I believe brother Brown that's the reason we left this message here a lot of people said well that means there you know he's not here no more he's left us here but you know if we can sing for God to save through that prophet I could ever see that and leave it in our hearts and notice God seek God that it was God that word that message that's the same God that elasticity I'll tell you tomorrow just to make it a strictly today another record in that little Rapture that is here and say Amen all right it's just a quick the water coconut Crystal school all down days and the grace God it's real
