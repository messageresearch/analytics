real good time yesterday at the fellowship meeting I think they was about somewhere 32 or 35 of us something was dire it was a good group I told them I said well if y'all have two or three more we'll have service and they just get through three coming you know into that a good timeline we're going to be that number brother Bob will be preaching for us the Lord willing this coming Wednesday so we'll keep him in your prayers okay brother Prakash will be here with us on the first Sunday in June so remember that we start schedule and you know in this time of the year and so remember those I know you already have but remember especially brother Boyd this morning that has kidney stone that the Lord would deliver him from those things and all be taken care of any other announcements we Jennie miss something but thank God for the rain that we received and James but it may come with other mixed blessings and be without power for a while but what does that make any difference it's just you you got to have those things to go along with the rain because it's got to work right how do we thank you this day for your loving your grace Lord thank you for all things we just asked you to be with us probably we ask you to bless brother Ernie unable to be with us this weekend shall we pray that you would just reach down and touch his body and let everything be all right ignored we love you and we thank you have your way with each and every one of us remember brother Boyd order that kidney stone because Lord there are horrible things and we just pray that you would deliver him that everything be all right we love you and we thank you your word is declared he is healed and we believe it we thank you goddess each one now as we talk about you you come on the scene to answer all of our thoughts and questions in Jesus name we're going to Ephesians 2 and then we'll go to Roman's 10 seasons 2 in Romans 10 we're going to verse 19 I wish you what I sitting there reading this morning I wish you would read the entire Ephesians 2 you know coming down to it but to bring it to a points is talking about us see now therefore you're no more strangers and foreigners because that's what he's covering how that we Gentiles were not part of the kingdom we were you know and all like that alright there are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow-citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and a build upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ Himself being the chief Cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto the holy temple in the Lord in whom you also are builded together for an habitation of God through the spirit all right then we go to Roman's 10 because this is a very familiar scripture with us but when we get to a point right Romans 10 1 through 11 brethren my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they might be saved for I bear them record that to have a zeal of God but not according to knowledge now not head knowledge true knowledge right they had great knowledge and I'm talking about that it's all about true knowledge Holy Ghost knowledge all right but not according to knowledge for they being ignorant of God's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth Ramos's describes the righteousness which is of the law the demand which doeth those things shall live by them but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise now what does the righteousness which is of faith safe all right say not in thine heart who shall ascend into heaven that is to bring Christ down from above or who showed this in the notice don't say that don't do it or who shall descend into the deep that is to bring up Christ again from the dead but what saith what saith the righteousness now which is a faith the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and then the heart that is the Word of Faith which we preach if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God has raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for with a heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation for the scripture says whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed you may be seated Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now a broader little message last Sunday morning trying to talk about them the rejecting of the cornerstone and you know I just couldn't get away from it so we're going to stay with that talk this morning to try to continue own because now here is I thought we talked about a cornerstone to to young kids and people that don't understand it's simply talking about that Jesus Christ is the cornerstone he's the stone of all of our everything we have is based in Jesus Christ all right and see it requires that we have the new birth to talk about us being in that part of you know understanding the cornerstone so what do you think about the cornerstone and I kept asking the question I want to keep asking it you know they rejected the cornerstone right all right could it be possible that we would reject the cornerstone no no we just listen to what I'm saying and think about it all right do we know for a certainty that there's no salvation outside of Jesus Christ all right and being no salvation outside of Jesus Christ then we know that he according to the Bible is that stone that was spoken of throughout the Old Testament the all of that bringing it down to talking about Jesus Christ all right but now why would it be why would it be that people who studied the word all of their life you know the priests in designs especially counting them and why would it be that they would reject him when he came now do you believe he came according to the word you know now what about coming according to the word in other words you got a written book you know a written book that tells you the whole story and that's the only book you're reading they didn't have Greer's almanacs and all kind of things back then you know they had the scrolls they didn't have all of the ideas of mankind and and the schools and that day was supposed to be the teachers of the Word of God huh and why would they reject it why would they reject Jesus Christ when he came what do you think about that what would be the reason that you would reject something that the books you read are emphatically stating what would take place they were looking for a messiah right because they believed the word spoke of the coming Messiah and they would believe that that Messiah would be God in human flesh because they could read the word then Jesus standing before them could say show me were I didn't come according to the word that I didn't do what the word said I would do you realize the point the seriousness of it now watch this in a minute we'll get down to ourselves because we say look you know a nice reason I read that scripture because I'm honest I'm after 50 years being in this message I'm beginning to be able to read that scripture because I heard that scripture read so many times and it was read and interpreted as being what all you got to do is believe in your heart and confess with your mouth and you're saved well you need to read it a little bit because it does that say you shall be but you know beside the point do you believe that everybody that believes in their heart and confess with their mouth is saved ain't talking about really truly believing I'm talking about do you believe that's because if you believe you believe Jesus Christ come and died and you believe that he died for your sins and you accepting him as your Savior and then you confess with your mouth does that mean you're saved what else could we do that's true but does it mean that you're saved why is it that everybody's not saved it does that you agree I mean any problem now with that situation or illustration I'm trying to give is you know yourself you've seen a lot of people make great confessions go to church and divide for a little while and then fall away right well what's wrong with the Bible it says if you believe in your heart confess with your mouth you shall be saved what's wrong maybe it's the way we believe as I said they were looking for and the Bible is specific about the things that would happen if you know the history of Israel they had many different interpretations of the word maybe one group would say he's coming into babying now that's hardly used at all but we'll say that that does bleed what the others believe that he was coming is a great ruler the others believe that he was coming as God upon the earth many many many different beliefs about one Bible you remember how I was trying to illustrate it like Sunday there you know it always bothered me back there in the Baptist Church that I hear so many confessions of that's Romans 10 and I'd see so many people that would abide for a little while and then they would walk away do you really know that too so it's not a he's a way legs wouldn't believer as well there was a maybe we'll get to it after I word that Jesus was talking to them about the cornerstone and and that revival says right about our and many believed on him and you know what he said about and he said and you rejected me right and said you rejected me is that well yet it says that they believed what brother down all it is you just you believe and you confess and you're saved well why is it that everybody that believes in confesses is not saying I don't dilly-dally with me in lines of well I just believed enough to get dividing the Luna let's don't worry about ads you you get tied up in your terminologies and ideas and you've missed the whole point how could it be that you could receive the genuine new birth and then the word come forth and you reject that word you said no that's impossible to do no that's not even possible it may be wrong over at the house but and it may take a while for you to come around the channel to be led back into you know but it does - right tell me you claim the baptism with the Holy Ghost before you ever heard of this message and I must say that I believe that but my point is is why when you heard the message did you reject it no no I believed it a minute I heard it well then you just lied to solve the problem no problem no arguments for nobody me you all of us we fought the message when we heard it right why because it was contrary to what we had heard it was contrary to them teaching us that all you got to do is believe we'll get back to it analyze part of the message but remember you said well I've accepted Jesus Christ as my savior and it's his responsibility to take care of that but has he accepted you now that puts it a different category having I've done everything he said for me to do well don't you think the Pharisees don't you think those people had done everything that they knew to do as waiting on the Messiah because altogether irregardless of how you they believed him to be or what it would be they all had to believe the Jews that there was a coming Messiah you agree with that no matter how they figured it out to be riding on a horse or doing this or coming they still believed in the coming Messiah they still believe today in the coming Messiah but why did they reject him when he came as I said you know - you got to listen I know twice - that message getting back to see if I could continue on it this he's coming back so would you stay with that part what about people who had studied the word all of their life and there stood the word before then and yet they crucified for what deed did they crucify for what wrong did they crucify the only wrong you can come up with is the fact that he didn't come according to their thinking but what about you and I what about you Quran well brother Li I believe I believe and I come into message and I believe it and I've been in the message 20 30 40 50 years whatever you know but why is it that everybody is not sealed into the kingdom of God that makes a confession with their mouth and claim to believe in their heart that's all my point my whole point is to remain you to think about it is it possible that we could be in the same shape they were in oh come on I'll come down through it I've been all through the years of the denominational times and through this message and heard people's philosophies and the things well all you got to do is believe it all you got to do is accept Jesus Christ as your Savior that's all you can do then confess with your mouth well now let's take that little talk confess with your mouth what do you confess him to be what do you mean he's my Savior he's my god we don't mean the king all of those things Israel was looking forward to and are still today looking forward to that so what do you think about it we went through the scripture is showing that Jesus spoke of him being the chief Cornerstone the very father scriptures from Psalms to her that he would be that that the builders would refuse him but he would become the headstone of the corner now that's in songs he would become the headstone the of the corner now there's a difference between the corner stone and the headstone because of the position that it is within but yet the headstone has to be more than the corner stone we'll get to that he said they did not listen to my point did they reject him as the cornerstone so thereby they rejected him as the Messiah they rejected him as their God the ruler their king any definition you want to place opponent they rejected that because they didn't want him to rule over them good by rejecting him he became the chief cornerstone of what not of Israel they rejected it he was the head stone to the Israel according to the scripture but if they could not receive the cornerstone why would you discuss the head stump are you with me you catch them appoint if they couldn't see the who the cornerstone is or was whatever which way you want to use terminologies how could you even talked about the headstone would have any reason for discussing the coming of the headstone if they rejected him as the cornerstone now remember the terminologies the scripture says that that one you rejected has become the head of the corner never think the church ain't never had a head he's always had to hate it he's RA it we get to probably it would turn around incite the headstone not coming yet he didn't he's the foundation stone Isaiah we read that I tried stone a precious cornerstone but sure foundation do all that believe upon him why would they turn him down now not the Romans turning him down in killing him no the church that was looking for that stone to come looking for that Messiah looking for that ruler that King the God that the word had spoke up and yet they rejected him don't you think that they could believe in their heart as I said there a moment ago the Bible talks is ending is coming down to there Jesus is telling and the Bible says and many of them believed were they saved no because he turned right around to the same people that's claiming to believe him and said you rejected the cornerstone you rejected me as your Savior you rejected me as your king or ruler could we do that as I said over and over Jesus Christ came exactly according to the Word of God you agree with that right to the letter according to the word when you read that a virgin would be born that's the letter of the word that happened when you read that he would be the branch out of David that's the word when you read that he would be God and Lord yet you know yourself we gave you the scripture where Jesus was standing there talking to him and he said you rejected the cornerstone and we said then it left you and went to another people it's gone to the Gentiles because they will believe what about see they rejected him as the head because he would have been the head of Israel now listen to my point what we get through them will divide this letter they rejected him as the Messiah they rejected him as the chief Cornerstone and he become a stumbling stone to them they believed not and listened web saying in the right way but they were believers right could it be that we'd be believers and reject no brother death I accepted Jesus Christ as my savior amen did he accept you then you get into terminologies and thoughts we will get back to the scripture about it how can you call on one if you don't know me when I brother they are you making it too technical because see when I accepted Jesus Christ I accepted him as my personal Savior well one is you out of trouble when somebody tried to explain one God to you if you accepted him as your personal Savior and you would accept him as Jesus Christ why did you thank him to be the third person of the Trinity or the second person or the first person well it was because you're thinking Lily right because I didn't know I'm not responsible I didn't know but why would you reject it when it would come to you you said we don't want women now so you can know the whole story and not be able to understand what the word is talking about as I said after all that we know about the Bible and it becomes the head of the corner but when the prophet of God would come for speaking of the headstone he says then come yet so that's why our dependence has to be up on the basis of whether this prophet in the end time was a prophet or not because he would be the only one that would have the correct understanding now come on I know what the Bible says but I know what it goes on to say we say well the Bible said that God winked at our ignorance that's true when we didn't understand he winked at her ignorance but then watch the rest of that scripture it says but we don't have no excuse now the truth has come you know how it exclusive an excuse of ignorance the truth is come who do you serve have you accepted him as the Messiah as the ruler as your Lord but now we're asking the question back as he accepted you now what would be wrong if he didn't accept us when we accept him we accept him what would be the problem maybe it's the way we accept him maybe it's us accepting him as being something that he's not the albert's you're imagining me responsible we're responsible to hear the word when the word is brought agree you see he never did come to Israel the way they were thinking he was to come I said the way they were thinking him to come so thereby they turned him down could we do that could we could he come to us and try to come to us and in us rejecting because of our preconceived ideas they come on we got it in the scripture right how can you call on him unless you know who you're calling on is that fire phrase in the scripture I hope you were that nothing else is brought out of this message today you'll get one point you can call him Jesus Jesus the Prophet said and still worshipping Satan and what about that it's what you don't understand brother Dale I accepted Jesus I know when Jesus came into my life well why did you reject the word when it was first told you then I did not confess and never have confessed that I had the Holy Ghost when I was back in her with the nominations coming out of there and coming into the message I never confessed that I came into the message proving I had to all ago I came into the message seeking after the Holy Ghost not trying to prop up something that I had done and I had seen many things and many things that happened in my life they were supernatural but yet when I saw or heard a prophet explaining Newburg I knew I didn't have it did it make you that way or did it make you great say well I believe the message and the reason I know I got to hold ago I believe the message winders the people of this message reject the message then see we're ready we'll get back to later in the message on down the road in Zachariah and for and I wish you would read that over and over and Zachariah and there's a little message called message of grace they better run a preach that you'd listen to it would help we're not going to talk about the headstone because they didn't receive the cornerstone was no need to talking about the headstone are you with me there's no need of all of your great understanding of the headstone if you don't know what the cornerstone is right is that simple now let's talk about the headstone remember I kind of said a lot of people years ago and the doctrine was they're coming around about the son of man and I asked you as the church you know about the son of God and it was not understood about the son of God but everybody understood about the son of man that's a simple question I said how can that be how can it be that you can understand all about son of man and you know nothing about son of God and that's the simple question where did the son of going to have the beginning called either son and had a beginning I'm asking you a simple question today how do you know you're saved my plate inant and I ask the second part of the question why is it that everybody says they believe you don't find it with it being right and believing it well God knows my heart that's the problem if he didn't know our heart we'd be in good shape right but now listen could it be because like I said no need talking about a headstone and we got this great nation to the headstone and all we got this way there's no need talking about that until you realize who the cornerstone is now remember the cornerstone becomes a headstone right but remember now according to the Bible the cornerstone that they rejected was the headstone and he became the headstone of the church yet the Prophet said the headstone had never come yet could it be that we would reject the stone and could it be that they rejected that stone the cornerstone because they didn't know who he was that was the point last Sunday they didn't know who he was had they known who he was would they're rejected him come on the Bible says it Bible plainly tells you had they known it they wouldn't crucified if they had known who that stone was they would have never in no way with one hand upon crucifying but they didn't believe him yet they were believers in God but I like brother Brennan's way of describing in things what he said now sadar was even the garden to death she didn't come up so I don't believe in God because she believed that but she put her own interpretation upon what God had said could we do that now we'll get back to the headstone later and bringing it in the thought well let's get this corner stone and get it as the Bible calls it a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense as to what as to them that stumble what at the word there's no way for us to know about God except by his word would you agree is that sensible the only way to good and it took him six thousand years to bring forth that word for us to build understanding to see by rejecting Jesus Christ as their Savior the Messiah they rejected the right of sonship they rejected the new birth they rejected the kingdom that we read that Jesus had to be taken from you kneeling to another you realize what they rejected their they rejected their very God that they believed in now why did they reject him in what happened see they believed they were the children of God right come on Israel believed they were the chosen they tell you that in hurry oh they were so great about it I remember that remember the one and they were talking to Jesus that day and he said something to him and they said we were never under bondage to no one then right then the Romans was ruling the Jews and killing them right is it true right then they were being killed by the Romans for any little thing go which is we were never under bondage to no one what do you think Jesus said when he looked at they said we will never under bondage nobody and he looks at him he says who do you pay your taxes to who you do the thing right see because they were rejecting the fact that somebody else was ruling over them it's kind of silly you're in jail but I'm not in jail behind bars I'm not my lord I'm free so you know they had enough understanding to realize that it was not the fact of what government was ruling them right they were not considering who was ruling them then broke they would not even let that come into being they were considering that they were the people of God right they were considering the fact that they were the children of God they were saying that God was their father and they knew nothing about the scriptural terminologies was the Messiah they would come to die for their sins they were only looking for a ruling Messiah that's why they rejected it when it came as a birth as a child they couldn't handle it at all even though the Bible as I said while ago spoke of it emphatically they would not accept him they rejected him as being their God the ruler they rejected sunshield Church do you realize that the Gentile dispensations the basics of agenda this sensation that claims to be God as their Savior as their healer has are all and all as their king has rejected that and crucified him again do we need to go into the message do we need to preach awhile on what for words for profit use dire they crucified him dire the greatest religious leaders they the greatest of all and really the great they're chosen crucified the most horrible death him the god of glory the Bible says we do that and put him to an open shame am I putting scriptures together would you see what I'm getting at they rejected the right of sonship it was never meant never would have been there's no way it could have taken place that God could have rode right into Jerusalem and they accepted him is all of these things and he was their king he was their ruler he was everything come on we're human being that would have never happened because that was not God's Way God's Way was to become as a child to live with mankind and to prove as they would even say we know this man has got to be of God because nobody can do the things that he does but why would you turn that down well what was that they do is phrase it you mean right now are you afraid if they come in here with a gun and said we're gonna kill everybody that confesses they're Christians any of those is gonna get up walk out and say I'm not a Christian oh I would do no you just walk out the door that's exactly what they were cover what are you following the talk to reject the right of sonship is exactly what Israel lost when God turned to the Gentiles to bring out a people for his name and Israel rejected it the kingdom truly then Jesus said was taken from them and given to another there were not even the people of God that's why we read then Paul talking about it by not accepting him as the Messiah they automatically turned down the birth rock because that's what the Messiah meant xavier by turning down the messiah not accepting him at being your savior you automatically turn down your rights of anything else but not knowing by not knowing is the reason Israel rejected him the way of truth was taken from them are you with me you shook head and grinned a little bit want to go any way that he did come according to way the word said right I mean he did Jesus did come exactly the way the Bible said he would come well after everybody studying that why couldn't somebody come up with the right understanding are you anything the best could could be brought out of it come on don't take me wrong with the best it could be brought out of all the understanding of the Old Testament was a handful of fishermen no learned scholars accepted Jesus Christ Paul is the greatest of all coming over right the great Nicodemus I know you're a mention from God he didn't accept it the great Camejo that knew the great ones one of those - you know said we better leave this alone because that if we don't it will be happily fighting against God and said if it's not of God it'll go away anyway because we doesn't have many of them before word that doesn't have many messiahs they try to take over and rule the government but could it be by not knowing is the reason they rejected a witch survival says the way of truth had been misinterpreted to them why didn't the ones who knew the truth say well it we need to believe this I said be great come at you and then great Nicodemus come on get the story what I'm talking about wording any other religious leaders at that time now come on are you with me where did any of them accept Jesus Christ when we get personal now for me but Nicodemus believed in his heart and confess with his mouth that he had to be something why was he not saved we know the story come on why I said we're glad we got a message we know the story but what if you had never heard understanding what would be your answer to Nicodemus and gamaya the great men that made a public confession Nicodemus went to Jesus confessing him to be something we know you're a teacher come from God you think he didn't believe in his heart it was shouldn't death to him if they'd have found him upfront or at least blackballing him you know and I'm sure they did because of some of the statements he made what are you with me why was Nicodemus not one of those it went to the upper room the best of all you could do was 11 no good come on the Lord forgive me for taking the wording to say it but it's true right tax collectors everybody hates them don't they all of these things of life and yesterday's brother told a joke with Arnaz noticed make a point not as a joke but said he walked out in the cemetery and he looked and said there on the sign said a politician and an honest man the guy looked at and said we know for sure there's two people buried in that grave come on right tax collectors fishermen couldn't even sign their own name you know I think about that a lot just you know you know the earth like this way he's like I think plenty unknowing to do you know that Peter wrote the scripture first the second theater he couldn't write his name so evidently somebody else much too wrote what he said right so we get the story right somebody else mr. Roy because he couldn't even write his name right but listen the best you could get out of it was a bunch of scoundrels a bunch of guys like Peter that would lie to try to save his own throat a Judas they would sell out for money we took one of them out of the group so you wind up with eleven and they try to in a matthäus everybody pronounce his name nothing's ever said about him we know that wasn't right to be was supposed to waited to Apostle Paul came along right good listen the point is why not one religious leader accepted Jesus Christ now come on your prophet said it you can say well Nicodemus minor your prophet said it now you arguing him he said Nicodemus and gamaya would be given eternal life for their stand for the gospel so that you know what that means they didn't have eternal life they didn't accept Jesus Christ as their Savior out of all the believing they had it was not a bit of it brought salvation to those two they meant something the Bible said he came to his own his own received him not then it stops right and he was he finished we said as many as received him gave he power to become the sons of God Israel rejected sonship right that's where their trouble is today when they rejected sonship they will never come back as a nation at sonship they will come back as 144,000 servants to the bride I don't care what you give them eternal life or what you want to do they will never be sons and daughters of a living God because they rejected that are you following me till they stumbled at the stumbling stone as we were talking about its first Peter 2 and 6 through 8 no they stumbled at the stumbling stone then why would it be called a stumbling stone and a rock of avenged he's not making him wrong he's got to be making what they were believing wrong they're believing was the problem okay let's go a little bit they stumbled at that stumbling-stone and he came to his own John won his own received him not but to a few of them he became the fulfillment of Psalms 118 he becomes the headstone of the corner right to just a handful he became to fulfill Matthew 21 the head of the corner a sure foundation a chief Cornerstone Isaiah spoke of in 26 of 16 City was a sure foundation and words that foundation laid and how does it connect to you and I go ahead and number six Ephesians 2 that we read and we're built our homes are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow-citizens a half a dozen the people come on you want the story from brother branham the church in ephesus who everybody dozen or something the best jesus jesus could do out of all of his three and five years of ministry coming according to the word and doing exactly the way the word come he winds up with eleven my rock the other two sweetly I think was three thousand later because those eleven will use right that's true look and are built upon what now Isaiah says then he that he's the sure foundation now look at your foundation what found a feet on me and I built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ Himself being the chief Cornerstone now let me ask you this way how do you read that scripture oh I really built upon the foundation apostles and prophets plain language what's it saying you're builds upon the revelation of the apostles and prophets right the foundation stone is revelation you build on the revelation of who Jesus Christ not of the Apostles mmm no it's of Jesus Christ in other words whatever his disciples teach you got to believe it you ever heard this statement made by the Prophet if Peter had her said standing on your head that would what would have been put in there and that would have been the way you would have come into the kingdom right come on are you with me see he knew he had place within them three and a half years of ministry for them to know who he was and they finally get down to the end of it other side says now we know now we believe that you've got it and you're the one he said do you humbly like I said but and no goods but that was the only one who listened to it what are you getting it they built upon the foundation you're built upon what the Apostles teach the teaching of the Apostles that's why we believe in what's called the faith of the father's that's the faith of the father's now look at the pyramid and we'll get back to it later you say the foundation stone it's right down here no excuse me this is the foundation stone you gonna sell him in the corner because you got a story about the stone when I would ask you to even give me a definition scripturally speaking of the stone and what because when he calls it the head of the corner when he called her the corner stone when he called it a chief corner stone are you with me this is the face of the father's not just faith as a born-again experience this entire pyramid is the faith of the father's we don't make it one stone at the bottom and then move the stone up the top you got to make it a revelation we're built upon the foundation we're built upon what the Apostles taught and don't worry about it they're not going to teach anything contrary to him why because it's him in them doing it all right now this is what we were trying to get to so let's get on to that point what about it why was it that they couldn't accept it go ahead waiter number seven let's tell you whether it's just a little now but can I say it this way you that have the notes if you look at your life's note on the back it is from the message is this the sign of the end time sir is this the time brother Branham says Romans tells you nine that they rejected it telling the Romans that the Jews tried to accept it by works but it's by faith that we believe it now I'm not doing this to be smart addict I'm just doing it to prove a point to show do you know what he's explaining right above dial it's not in your notes so don't worry about it but you know what he's explaining right above that and he comes out to a statement that the Jews tried to accept it by works but it's by faith that we believe it you know what vision he was explaining right above that and why would he conclude it with Romans and said the Holy Spirit gave him the scripture and he turned back to it he turned to it read it he said lord if that be you if this is sowing sowing throwing throwing I'm going to die said don't let me you know let it be that I don't tell nobody we said if this is in other words the fundamental perforation of my ministry let the spirit come back he says likely took him out of the building and then he concludes it by saying it concludes it by saying that the Jews rejected it could we reject what he said right above there so that makes you interesting to go home look look you know what he was explaining right above there he was explaining the vision of the seven angels that come to him in Arizona so what are you doing I'm trying to show you it's got to be by faith a revelation not by your ideas my idea he's explaining the vision of the little birds in the bigger birds and then the angels coming to him and he concludes it by saying that the Holy Spirit led him back to that scripture and if that busy let me read it he turn right to it and read it he said they sought it not by faith we got it all figured out we know what this is we know what that is and that was what he was explained so let's read the scripture he's talking from Romans and saying about how the Gentiles followed not after righteousness remember last Sunday we were on that but they've attained to righteousness even to the righteousness which is of faith but Israel which followed after the law of righteousness in other words they kept the law to the letter remember last Sunday trying to express it they'd done it to the letter they there was no way that Jesus told the conference or any of them you know you a bunch of dirty dogs he done this or so-and-so he never called out anything because it didn't have anything to be called out he never condemned them for what they were doing that way he condemned them because they didn't believe who he was right their lives were right they were following it by the work for the law the law said don't knew they didn't know well knew they did do but Israel which followed after the law Reisen have not attained to the law of righteousness why wherefore because they sought it not by faith but as it were by the works of the law something that could do or not do for they stumbled at the stumbling stone they stumbled by trying to do what they're supposed to do but just remember one thing we also know the story it was never God's right or will to have given the law the law was added the Bible said because of man's transgression the law was not original to be given they wanted the law am i right is it Exodus 19 the greatest mistake Israel ever made am i right am i quoting a prophet the greatest mistake they ever made we're saying give us something to do give us a law we'll keep it knowing they could not do it because like I said like Sunday I wish that would bound into our hearts and life there is nobody can keep the law no person no human can keep the law it takes a born-again believer to keep the law one without the born-again experience can't keep the law you see what I didn't do this I didn't do that does that make you saved ours where you troubled that what you were before they sought it not by faith but as it were by the works of the law for they stumbled at that stumbling-stone so that stumbling stone was not a bunch of works it was faith I thought we were building the foundation of the apostles and prophets the revelation of the Apostles and probably you were agreeing with me there for a minute ago but now you're kind of slow back because you don't know which way I'm headed right that's a good idea but listen you stumble at the stumbling stone they did they would not listen to those apostles even after the death the resurrection and the things they would not listen to what those disciples said about the foundations tongue right do we listen to what the foundation stone says if everything we've got built on the foundation upon the problem oh no brother Dale they were there right down here this is foundational I know that whole thing according to Peter the statue of perfect man is the faith of the fathers that's the cornerstone is that whole pyramid right here with the headstone ain't come yet now listen for they stumbled at the revelation of Jesus Christ is that putting it down in the language they stumbled at the stumbling stone and stone is not a rock laying out somewhere it's revelation of Jesus Christ could we stumble at that because we don't know what it is you see I know you don't like my terminology and I know people out there don't but that comes down into my heart and I just cry to sleep the preachers of this message is the ones that had blinded the eyes of the people to the word that the Prophet wrote if not that the same thing I say done they said Jesus took that you stand in the door and won't go in and won't let them go in is that scripture the brother we don't need to do these deep lines on the prophet preach it why is it in the Bible well we just tire that out told you about a brother one time you know he was really being great and smart you know he said that the first Corinthians I say at 13 was a gift some time he said that'll be a tour out of the Bible I'm sorry I'm just human I said give me your Bible but then what you're gonna do terr it out he knew better to give me that Bible because he knew exactly I'd about him 10 brand new Bibles it make no difference about that but it even handed me that Bible he was warning said it not me not me tutor it out to me it's the Word of God that's the staff the Lord as well in John 3:16 I said give me a bottle he wouldn't dare let me edit I'm sorry I've always been that way because I believe it what the word is saying what they stumbled not to disciples the disciples didn't stumble they walked by faith right into the revealed word they were the ones that was being rejected if you're listening to me when he came on over to the time the disciples was the foundation apostles and prophets Jesus Christ being Durov elation to be talk to the people who are they turning down Jesus Christ right we know that who were they turning down the apostles not because they were the ones with the revelation come on listen now actually said but they stumbled at the stumbling stone they stumble into revelation of the simplicity of Jesus Christ as it is written behold I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and rock of offense whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed why because it's the cornerstone it's the cornerstone but what it is where do they stumble at go on to number eight let's get a couple more little quick first Peter to in a sentence under your die for which believe he's precious but it is then which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made the head of the corner you know that life Sunday he's the head of even the center even the center he's a head so don't think about that I would say in any way that your church ain't never had a head the church is always had a head Paul spoke of it as Christ in the church Paul spoke of the headstone but it was not the headstone like the finality it was where the cornerstone had become the head it always been a head even to the sinner but look this is what I like about it and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense to who even to them which stumble at the word stumble at the face of the father's yet everybody knows all about it all he goes I know nothing about the face of the father's may not tell you a little bit about it how are we living there are a lot of people in this nation I believe brother branham of a 262 didn't know what he's talking about when he finally got straightened out in 63 you know you tell me where the faith of the father's day because according to my understanding the messenger of Malachi 4 is supposed to do two things 1 turn hearts of children back to faith fathers to bring the thunders I thought it was to be done both ways but listen then that stumble at the word being disobedient weren't to they were appointed naturally as rotor story naturally Israel the laws adoption everything pertaining to Israel because they were the chosen they were appointed to sonship but they rejected it by rejecting sonship they rejected everything could it be if we don't understand sonship that we could reject sit and talk with two brothers one time and one of them said when I got born again I got everything he's telling about the pyramid they place the other one said ain't got nothing yet I said well brothers y'all mind if I just stay between you because somewhere between heart he's got to be a truth if you think you got everything when you got the new bird I don't agree with that but don't agree with the other brother saying ain't got nothing yet I said somewhere in the training high laser truth would you think they took the truth but listen but as to them which stumbled at the word I had an opportunity in early ministry to visit some of these other countries and I went out crying in my heart because I saw people and I knew of people here in America that was sending their great missionaries over there to those countries and I knew they were putting big money in behind it buying things and doing things for to get them to believe what they said because they didn't have no way to argue they didn't have the next speech they had people coming over and saying this is what the Prophet says right here this wasn't part of it I cried I said my heart to think about I'll do the best I can to try to help these people to be able to get right around his message and the best that I can do of it because that was my desire where would you be today if you had no message and a preacher get up the pulpits and brother Brown said join Joe right around said so and rum we didn't say it the mercy of the elements you think that ain't that's bad out there in the world what about the mercy of the elements of this message people and the one thing that hurt me more than anything if one brother said it all Colin Haynes he called but he said you think about those people settled are listening and said where we quote Paul and Peter and James and John as being the Word of God coming forward the Apostles said they're quoting brother so-and-so brother so-and-so brother Shan Hsiung I cried because I knew the name they called and none of them was on the truth but yet they were quoting I'm just like quoting the Bible brother so-and-so said it not being mixed with faith in them that heard it could we stumble at the stumbling stone I don't mean to be smart aleck I mean to be truthful I've tried my best to get you away from the church away from doctrines an idea preached things to you to try to get you to see where people were wrong the biggest portion of you just think I'm being arrogant and hateful and trying to make a point of my own I still don't want to stumble after stumbling scum but I ask you the last thing you say I've accepted Jesus Christ as my savior we got in your scripture how you going to know unless you somebody tells you who can how can you call on him if you don't know we're out of time we'll get back to it I do want to bring out one little thing go to verse go to number nine which is God's provided way let's let brother Branham explain this about accepting because I asked a simple question you've accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior and you say you're saved but has he accepted you come on sisters after you accepted Jesus Christ you kept on cutting your iron paint your face don't look like you accepted you brother Dale and then just by accepting it won't only do and you read his wordings that's what he said in other words he saying this accepting it you think that that don't work right won't only do if that's not enough to just accept God's got to vindicate back that he has accepted you that's the thing you can accept him but then if he accepts you stay right there until he does accept you and when he does he seals you into the kingdom by the baptism of the Holy Spirit then you have your secure until the day of your attention remember Paul and you receive the Holy Ghost since you believe there's the next one then we'll quit come on musicians George out in 1961 don't look at yourself look at your lamb God don't accept you he accepted the lamb he said were you telling me that I need to find out if I'm accepted of God now I'm trying to tell you how that can be done you just remember it's not you it's the lamb it's the lamb the one he's accepting right chosen in him is this the scripture when before the foundation of the world when did he choose you when he chose the lamb so what I thought you were going to give me some kind of a something that I'd be looking forward to finding something that's what else praise God keep searching they'll never stop searching for God don't ever stop searching for God to reveal itself to you we just remember the lamb is the cornerstone the cornerstone it's the foundation stone the foundation stone is the revelation of Jesus Christ I'm not worried about him accepting me that it'd be wrong but will he accept what I've said about him will you accept what I've said about him then we can take signs and wonders and use it sometimes God has done to help us and I can stand here all evening talk about them things and you know it from the dead raised to angels three times to see in garden when I was 11 years old I can talk to you about a lot of things with another one of those and I put as my experience with the revelation of Jesus Christ which is what brother Branham what is the new verb Christ mister God revealed he said it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you do you have that experience in that way you're doing away with things and you're getting away from and that we all believe in the signs and the wonders that you can be right in the middle of the devil's trap with your signs and wonders but you cannot be in a devil's trap if you've got the revelation of Jesus Christ may I quote brother Ronnie the devil can't bring the word so then I put everything I've got on what he's giving me with the word let's stand together what we've got seek it by faith not by works [Music] my revelation have a need y'all doors open accept Jesus Christ as your personal Savior yes but then wait on him to speak to you keep seeking him until he speaks to you something that gave me questions [Music] then you can talk about the message then you can talk about believing build upon the foundations apostles and prophets beautiful what they say one day Peter said add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge temples places godliness brotherly kindness right build upon what he said see that has to be restored to the church before you can talk about a headstone may I say it now listen without a headstone you're not coming to the change of the body ah that's 40 some years that I've been preaching it that away without a headstone ain't going to be no change of the body what about why do we thank you we just asked you to go with the people today and just help us to understand we're trying our best to see a simple plan of salvation that Jesus Christ is revealed to each and everyone of us personally to us not as a group or at all but as an individual reveal the person of Jesus Christ we know that each one of the apostles and prophets had that revelation for their time and they were built upon that and we take because we miss that scripture which had built on the foundation of the Apostles that's New Testament Lord and prophets their prophets in the New Testament but this revelation is built upon all the prophets down through time and then the Apostles having the same revelation of Jesus Christ we love you and we thank you in Jesus name you dismissed [Music] [Music] did woman don't you worry
