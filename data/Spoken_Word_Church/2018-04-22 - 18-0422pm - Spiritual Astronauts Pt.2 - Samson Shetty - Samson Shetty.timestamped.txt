[33:21] and all of our success and the very
[33:25] camel to the very power of the beast in
[33:29] the Bible represents power and the very
[33:32] power that we give water and praise to a
[33:36] man see water life praise to the world
[33:40] is the very thing that pacts us into the
[33:45] glory land to meet the bridegroom yes
[33:49] sir
[33:50] praise the Lord and really and also the
[33:53] you know I was so you know and I was
[33:57] speaking about the Prophet's reward when
[33:59] you went up to that to see the circus I
[34:02] brother Wade gave me that word really
[34:03] and thank you brother you know sometimes

[34:18] so when brother Branham went up to that
[34:21] place and he said and you all know that
[34:23] story and he is to tell his friends and
[34:26] we are his friends and God took him up
[34:30] to the 6th dimension
[34:32] it's not a circus it's a supernatural
[34:35] really it's a supernatural dimension
[34:39] amen and and and he went there and he
[34:43] had seen all the glorious things and uh
[34:46] and our loved ones and the saints of God
[34:49] in all those ages and then he came back
[34:53] and he told us amen and I was talking
[34:56] about the prophets reward and I got this
[34:59] wonderful you know quotations from
[35:01] brother Joe and 1964 by the Brando
[35:03] question and answers in jeffersonville
[35:06] he said brother Brandon you know I think
[35:08] sister Hazel Canada
[35:12] I think sister Hazel Canada asked this
[35:14] question brother Branham if you have
[35:17] time please explain Matthew 1041 I would
[35:21] like to know what is a Prophet's reward
[35:22] and I was when I was young when I came
[35:26] to the message for the and in the in the
[35:28] beginning you know I was thinking about
[35:30] what was the Prophet's reward and after
[35:32] we came into the messy we are reading
[35:34] and learning and studying you know so
[35:36] then we know that Prophet's reward is to
[35:38] befriend with a prophet we all are the
[35:42] friends of the prophet of God amen
[35:45] praise the name of the Lord and then we
[35:48] you know while you I was talking to
[35:50] brother Aaron this afternoon he said you
[35:52] know we heard about the radio and we
[35:56] used to hear all the voices and you know
[35:58] the sound and then when the television
[36:01] came up they when they invented the
[36:05] television now the voice became as a
[36:08] picture like brother Brian how he said
[36:13] he preached the message called I have
[36:15] heard but now I see see we heard from
[36:19] the radios and now we can see you know
[36:21] so it's all time a natural technology
[36:27] everything it's a type to the
[36:30] supernatural amen praise the Lord and
[36:33] also I thank the brother and sister here
[36:36] they took me from the park to the
[36:38] pastor's office thank you brother thank

[37:05] scriptures what we have read this
[37:07] morning Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 1 2
[37:12] 3 now faith is the substance of things
[37:15] hoped for the evidence of things not
[37:19] seen for by it the elders obtained a
[37:23] good report through faith we understand
[37:26] that the words were worlds were framed
[37:29] by the Word of God so that things which
[37:32] are seen were not made of things which
[37:35] do appear
[37:36] may the Lord and His blessings of
[37:38] reading of his word let's bow our horse

[1:00:47] as a man minister as a as a pastor you
[1:00:50] know as a man of God I told them to stop
[1:00:52] stop but sometimes they don't hear you
[1:00:55] sometimes even though believers

[1:19:15] enjoy the word amen and here we we have
[1:19:19] read many scriptures here and also the
[1:19:21] courts here this morning and also this
[1:19:24] evening
[1:19:24] so my brothers and sisters hear what he
[1:19:27] said but at the same time the true the
[1:19:30] real true believer in Christ has entered
[1:19:34] this astronaut amen by one spirit we all
[1:19:38] baptized into one astronaut oh one body
[1:19:42] it can stand any kind of pressure
[1:19:46] spiritual scientists Houma so the real
[1:19:49] spiritual believer has a campaigned
[1:19:52] himself and got into God's ocean art
[1:19:56] Christ believing all things what God
[1:20:00] said amen we believe that now notice the
[1:20:02] real believer is in Christ no
[1:20:04] condemnation to them that is in Christ
[1:20:07] preached the word you don't see in the
[1:20:11] world they are preaching the world I
[1:20:12] like what how brother branham said you
[1:20:15] know when we do mission work or foreign
[1:20:18] mission with the Word of God we are
[1:20:21] always in the will of God amen
[1:20:23] with the Word of God people are going
[1:20:25] and doing mission work but always the
[1:20:28] word first word of God the message of
[1:20:31] the hour is the first amen as a bride of
[1:20:34] Jesus Christ will know that praise the
[1:20:36] Lord hallelujah
[1:20:37] and he says tear with the word I don't
[1:20:40] care what the denomination say I don't
[1:20:43] care what my uncle said
[1:20:46] I don't care what my cousin's my
[1:20:48] brother-in-law said no sir but you know
[1:20:52] what
[1:20:53] my brother my cousin also a Yahoo
[1:20:55] offered me easy
[1:20:56] he's like a Pentecostal either he's a
[1:20:58] Pentecostal man and there are big people
[1:21:00] you know like when you talk about them
[1:21:03] oh you know that man oh oh we are you
[1:21:06] related to him oh you know but you know
[1:21:09] but to me if there if there is no word
[1:21:14] what what is greater than word what is
[1:21:18] greater than the message of the hour I
[1:21:20] have never seen anything this world so
[1:21:23] that's why Peter and the disciples said
[1:21:25] Jesus said do you want to live to whom
[1:21:29] shall we go where we go
[1:21:31] I don't know why these people are
[1:21:33] getting crazy you know a brother from I
[1:21:39] I used to I mean I met him in some youth
[1:21:44] camp when I came to America first time
[1:21:47] and this brother is no more in the
[1:21:49] message and they're used to in that
[1:21:52] they're used to you know go to church a
[1:21:55] message church and and they love the
[1:21:57] Lord they love the message they follow
[1:21:58] the message and his wife grown a long
[1:22:01] hair and long skirts and everything but
[1:22:04] now pants makeup head you know haircut
[1:22:08] what happened and all of a sudden they
[1:22:11] sent me a message text message saying
[1:22:13] you know brother branham did this beard
[1:22:15] and a daughter and when I check that
[1:22:18] believe the sign when I saw that the
[1:22:20] Holy Spirit said just tell them believe
[1:22:23] the sign so I read believe the sign ok
[1:22:28] dot-com I wrote them brother
[1:22:32] the website says like this believe the
[1:22:35] side so just believe the sign that's it
[1:22:39] no more questioning and no more
[1:22:42] answering just believing just believing
[1:22:46] I don't want to you know argue and you
[1:22:49] don't want to ask me any questions no
[1:22:52] more questioning no more answering no
[1:22:55] more discussion just believe
[1:22:58] the believe the scientists believe the
[1:23:02] sign that's it still it's got that so I
[1:23:05] don't know why these people are living
[1:23:07] there God said some kind of crazy ideas
[1:23:10] Satan went into their brains and
[1:23:13] corrupted and polluted their brains with
[1:23:15] the worldly technology if we take like
[1:23:18] the brother was telling I think brother
[1:23:20] Lewis yesterday or brother Joel we are
[1:23:22] having this discussion talking you know
[1:23:24] and the tree of knowledge and good and
[1:23:26] evil and everything is good and evil if
[1:23:30] you eat food a lot if you eat a certain
[1:23:33] certain quantity to your body that's
[1:23:36] good if you eat a lot you may have
[1:23:38] stomach pain stomachache or headache or
[1:23:41] you got some diarrhea whatever you know
[1:23:43] the problem you know or you know your
[1:23:46] sugar levels go up or BP bread pressures
[1:23:48] go up or down or whatever you know
[1:23:50] everything you know you got to have our
[1:23:52] balance even in the word - we have to
[1:23:57] have a balance we must maintain the
[1:23:59] balance you know so these people just
[1:24:03] losing all things and taking this
[1:24:05] technology and and then and commenting
[1:24:07] on the supernatural cloud I don't have
[1:24:10] any shadow of doubt on that cloud a man
[1:24:15] we believe the sign that's it a man and
[1:24:19] a man so here brother Branham said that
[1:24:22] real true believer in Christ as entered
[1:24:25] in his astronaut praise the Lord praise
[1:24:28] the Lord thank you Jesus I don't care
[1:24:33] what the denomination says they are
[1:24:35] going to believe it
[1:24:36] who the true spiritual astronauts they
[1:24:41] believe the sign they believe the world
[1:24:43] they believe the Prophet amen amen
[1:24:47] what made them a divine revelation a new
[1:24:51] verse rather random said what is the new
[1:24:52] birth it's a personal revelation to you
[1:24:55] in the crisis the mystery of God
[1:24:57] revealed it's a personal you know it's
[1:25:01] not a baptism of the Holy Ghost in the
[1:25:03] same message he was telling he was
[1:25:04] saying that the baptism of the Holy
[1:25:06] Ghost gives you the power but the new
[1:25:09] birth is something else
[1:25:11] see the pentecostal there's talked over
[1:25:14] there but beyond the Pentecostal age we
[1:25:17] are coming of course
[1:25:19] like brother branham said we are going
[1:25:21] through the same door like Noah they
[1:25:23] went to the same door one door and we
[1:25:26] read the scripture in this morning in
[1:25:28] the revelation there the hope and heaven
[1:25:30] now ehman was opened with the one door
[1:25:32] and Jesus said I am the door and he just
[1:25:36] I am the doors no I am the door one door
[1:25:40] and it is opened it is open for everyone
[1:25:44] it is open for you and me it is open so
[1:25:48] when we when we are going through that
[1:25:50] that means we are going through a
[1:25:51] justification first floor and then first
[1:25:55] floor and second floors sanctification
[1:25:57] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost then
[1:25:59] after the new verse the what you see
