[22:06] [Music]
[22:14] [Music]
[22:26] [Music]
[22:42] [Music]

[24:04] [Music]
[24:14] [Music]
[24:20] [Music]
[24:34] [Music]
[24:54] hey man I'm learning more and more what
[24:56] Instant means this is instant in season
[24:59] out of season I don't know what season
[25:01] it is I just know this is an instant
[25:03] where I was under the expectation that
[25:05] be about an hour hour and a half before
[25:07] before I would be cold up to the pulpit
[25:10] so I'm glad I did it take my shoes off
[25:11] or take a nap or anything as all of a
[25:14] sudden I noticed they're singing my song
[25:16] so we're excited to get into the word
[25:19] usually a preacher's just chomping at
[25:20] the bit this is the perfect song service
[25:23] just a song a special and into the word
[25:25] but I know there may be more following
[25:27] but we'll just do our part and lift up
[25:29] the word for a few moments with you it's
[25:31] good to be here and have my wife and
[25:33] four children
[25:33] we've known some of you for many many
[25:36] years some of you just getting to meet
[25:38] for the first time and this is probably
[25:39] a good practice before we minister
[25:41] tomorrow because my my manner of
[25:44] ministry may be different for you or you
[25:45] may may have never heard me preach
[25:47] before so take some getting used to and
[25:49] if I'm if you need to get used to me
[25:52] well I have to get used to you too my
[25:53] first time ever preaching here and we
[25:55] appreciate the invitation by the Samuel
[25:58] the opportunity to be here and minister
[25:59] at this fellowship meetings it's just a
[26:01] real great privilege and we've met
[26:02] brother Wade before and appreciate the
[26:04] fellowship and the extension of the
[26:06] invitation while you're standing if we
[26:08] could just turn to Psalms 23 to the
[26:11] whole chapter and it's just Psalm 23 not
[26:14] any other Psalm that may be many pages
[26:16] long just six six verses here in Psalm
[26:19] 23 and this might be one of those Psalms
[26:21] that some could quote by heart but we
[26:24] wanted to use verse five in particular
[26:27] today just to share a thought on the
[26:30] bride's secret feast I thought it might
[26:32] be appropriate since this is a
[26:34] fellowship afternoon and we'll have
[26:36] service and then go feast on natural
[26:38] food let's just fellowship on the
[26:39] spiritual food that God has prepared for
[26:41] us Psalm 23 verse 1 the Lord is my
[26:44] shepherd I shall not want he maketh me
[26:47] to lie down in green pastures he leadeth
[26:50] me beside the still waters he restoreth
[26:52] my soul he leadeth me in the paths of
[26:55] righteousness for his name's sake yea
[26:57] though I walk through the valley of the
[26:59] shadow of death I will fear no evil for
[27:02] thou art with me thy rod and thy staff
[27:04] they
[27:05] comfort me now prepares a table before
[27:08] me in the presence of mine enemies thou
[27:10] anointest my head with oil my cup
[27:13] runneth over surely goodness and mercy
[27:16] shall follow me all the days of my life
[27:19] and I will dwell in the house of the
[27:22] Lord forever amen let's bow our heads in
[27:25] a word of Prayer a gracious Heavenly
[27:27] Father were so happy to be gathered
[27:28] together this afternoon Lord is a
[27:31] customary for these many churches to
[27:33] come together for some it might just
[27:35] seem to be that a custom or tradition
[27:37] but Lord we just ready ourselves now
[27:40] realizing that if you were gather
[27:41] together this many elect under one roof
[27:44] Lord you would desire to speak to us you
[27:46] would desire to do something
[27:47] supernatural
[27:48] so we yield to you now Lord designed
[27:50] that you come take the bread of life as
[27:52] only you can break it to us as the
[27:54] master of the house feed us by it Lord
[27:56] we ask you to come now and just minister
[27:59] to our hearts through your word for a
[28:00] few moments together as family before we
[28:03] continue to fellowship around the word
[28:05] with different ones perhaps sharing
[28:06] things from their heart Lord and
[28:08] gathering around a natural table
[28:09] together to eat natural food may you
[28:11] have the preeminence in all of it Lord
[28:13] we ask you to bless this reading of the
[28:15] word Lord and the rest of this service
[28:16] in the name of Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[28:18] amen you may have your seeds I'm just
[28:25] going to jump right into it here in
[28:27] verse 5 it says thou prepares the table
[28:31] before me in the presence of mine
[28:34] enemies and so we know when he says thou
[28:37] prepares the table he's speaking about
[28:39] God so this is the Lord's doing this is
[28:42] something that God has done and the word
[28:45] prepare us that means to furnish
[28:46] something or set it in order so he
[28:48] ordains a table God has set in order a
[28:51] table and that table is not just any
[28:54] word in the way that this word could be
[28:55] used it signifies a sacred table
[28:59] something has sacred use something
[29:00] that's been set aside it actually if you
[29:02] to look at the definition of the meaning
[29:04] behind the word that's used here it
[29:06] speaks of the Kings table this as thou
[29:08] has prepared a table before me and this
[29:11] table is a private table it's a it's a
[29:13] table for an exclusive party as it
[29:16] speaks of a king's table and so in this
[29:19] scripture David is remarking that God
[29:21] has prepared him a secret feast one that
[29:24] not everybody is invited to it's a feast
[29:26] we're only a special group of people a
[29:28] select group of people and I love how he
[29:31] says it because it seems to be such a
[29:33] contradiction or paragraph paradox thou
[29:37] prepares the table before me in the
[29:39] presence of mine enemies it's a really
[29:42] odd place to eat it's a really odd place
[29:44] to have a picnic or to set a table up to
[29:47] have a meal and to be to say in the
[29:49] presence it means at a distance and away
[29:52] from so it's not just that your enemy's
[29:55] right on top of you but it's in in spite
[29:56] of the enemy he's prepared the table
[29:59] even though I have many enemies round
[30:01] about me God has prepared a table it's
[30:03] in spite of the enemy and in such a way
[30:06] that they cannot prevent the fees but
[30:09] one thing that you have to notice is the
[30:11] enemy is there and despite the presence
[30:14] of the enemy God prepares a feast for
[30:16] him and the enemy is a hostile adversary
[30:19] it's one which is against the truth and
[30:22] against those to whom the truth is
[30:24] ordained for and brother Branham says
[30:26] anyone against the word is your enemy
[30:28] and so he says he's prepared a table
[30:31] before me in the presence of my enemy
[30:33] and I want to use this table in psalms
[30:35] 23:5 as a representation of the bride's
[30:38] secret feast that God has prepared to
[30:41] her a table he's prepared her a table in
[30:43] the presence of her enemies and this is
[30:45] a secret feast it's a hidden feast but
[30:47] it's also a protected feast it's a feast
[30:50] which is safe because he's prepared a
[30:52] table in the presence of your enemies
[30:53] where they're there and he doesn't in
[30:56] spite of them and in Psalms 27 which to
[30:59] me is a remarkable Scripture and the
[31:00] message how brother branham takes Psalms
[31:02] 27 and he connects it with the rapture
[31:04] and he David begins to write that the
[31:07] Lord is my light and my salvation he's
[31:09] the strength of my life though the
[31:11] wicked even my enemies would come upon
[31:14] me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and
[31:16] fell why says because I've desired one
[31:19] thing and in this will I be confident
[31:21] that I'll seek after your face for at a
[31:23] time of trouble you'll hide me in the
[31:25] secret of your tabernacle
[31:27] and he says now is my head lifted up
[31:30] above my enemies right there and the
[31:32] secret of his presence and the secret of
[31:34] his pavilion and the secret of his
[31:36] tabernacle even though the enemies are
[31:38] there he lifts your head up above them
[31:40] and Davis said my enemies are all around
[31:43] me and we may feel the presence of our
[31:44] enemies identified themselves more and
[31:47] more we recognize oh that's my enemy
[31:49] that's my enemy these things are my
[31:51] enemy but yet in the presence of the
[31:53] enemy he prepares a table again I want
[31:57] you to ponder the paradox of it this is
[31:59] a prepared table and David said no a
[32:01] host should encamp about me though I'm
[32:03] surrounded by the enemies
[32:05] normally a surrounded soldier would eat
[32:07] in haste you wouldn't have time for a
[32:10] table he wouldn't have time for all the
[32:11] trappings of a nice meal he would have
[32:13] to eat in haste and maybe even forego
[32:15] eating - ready himself for a fight but
[32:17] here there's nothing as hurried there's
[32:21] no confusion of war there's no
[32:22] disturbance yet the enemies are there
[32:24] but despite the enemy's presence I'm see
[32:26] I'm feasting why because it's a secret
[32:28] feast the enemy don't even know what
[32:31] you're doing
[32:31] the enemy can't even see the table the
[32:34] enemy doesn't even know how to get there
[32:35] but yet there you are in calmness and
[32:38] stillness and the presence of your
[32:39] enemies enemies in the presence of
[32:41] adversaries you can just be calm there
[32:43] at a table prepared by the king to feast
[32:47] it's a secret feast in revelations
[32:50] chapter 3 verse 20 which should have
[32:52] special significance to us to know the
[32:54] age of Laodicea and then after the
[32:57] description of Laodicea now there's a
[32:59] something supernatural that happens it
[33:01] says behold I stand at the door and
[33:03] knock If any man hear my voice and open
[33:06] the door I will come in to him and will
[33:09] sup with him and he with me so there's
[33:13] something remarkable that happens here
[33:15] at the end of the Laodicean Church age
[33:16] in the order of these prophecies where
[33:18] the Lord steps down into Laodicea is for
[33:21] the purpose of a feast behold I stand at
[33:24] the door and knock and it's not so much
[33:26] that you hear the knocking but you've
[33:28] got to hear his voice
[33:28] If any man hear my voice and open the
[33:31] door says I will come in to him and will
[33:34] sup with him and he will sup with me
[33:37] this word sup and the word that's used
[33:39] is speaks of a supper or feast
[33:41] specifically a formal meal which is held
[33:44] at the evening time where there is time
[33:46] where you take food and food is eaten at
[33:48] a particular time and he says I will
[33:50] come and if you'll open the door to my
[33:52] voice I will come in to you and I will
[33:55] feast with you and you will feast with
[33:57] me so he's promised and evening time
[34:00] feast with his bride and this is a
[34:03] formal dinner when he says I'll sup with
[34:05] them he's not saying we'll have a snack
[34:07] this isn't a snack this is a meal of
[34:10] multiple courses it isn't he didn't step
[34:13] down into this age that we're living in
[34:15] now and say well here's an apple here's
[34:17] a banana here's something to hold you
[34:19] over I know many times we do a lot of
[34:21] traveling in the ministry and we do over
[34:24] 25,000 miles a year just driving
[34:26] together as a family and there's many
[34:28] times your kid will say I'm hungry and
[34:30] we know we're getting to a restaurant
[34:31] where no one coming up ahead maybe an
[34:33] hour way and we'll give something to the
[34:35] kids to hold them over listen in this
[34:37] journey God just didn't give you
[34:38] something to hold you over he gave you
[34:40] something to get you to the end of the
[34:42] journey just as Elijah witness strength
[34:45] of that meat many days he's given the
[34:47] bride something that'll not just hold
[34:49] them over but get him out of here
[34:52] but the Branham says in the message turn
[34:55] on the light he references the scripture
[34:57] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[35:00] every word of God the bread of life not
[35:04] just part of the words every word of God
[35:07] every age just don't stay and eat beans
[35:11] and potatoes all the time there's other
[35:14] things that goes with it as we go on
[35:16] into the full course of God's great
[35:19] dinner that sit before his people the
[35:22] power of the Holy Ghost the rejoicing of
[35:24] it of the power and the spirit that has
[35:26] been given and he's using a language
[35:30] which some could key in on this part and
[35:32] some can key on the other part but he's
[35:34] trying to get us to understand that this
[35:36] is a full course of God's great dinner
[35:38] so there's a man here who can turn on
[35:41] the light and he has prepared a table
[35:43] for us in the presence of our enemies to
[35:45] have a full
[35:46] course of God's great dinner not just
[35:48] one part not just a taste here to taste
[35:50] that this isn't just a tasting menu this
[35:53] is the full menu and the seed not air
[35:57] with the shucks he says neither will a
[35:58] Christian eat on the dead okarians from
[36:01] old denominational doctrines and things
[36:03] just desert he's speaking of how an
[36:05] eagle won't feast on the dead things and
[36:07] he talks about a hawk losing its
[36:09] position and all these vultures and
[36:10] things but he says the Christian won't
[36:12] eat on Dedic Aryans from all
[36:14] denominational doctrines and things they
[36:17] want the Word of God fresh is that you
[36:21] you want the Word of God fresh he says
[36:24] the promise of the hour so that's what
[36:27] we want is not just not just something
[36:29] from a day gone by but what has been
[36:31] prepared for this hour
[36:32] he said God promised rabbits in the days
[36:35] of Luther he promised other things in
[36:37] the days of others but now listen
[36:40] there's been a change in diet there's
[36:42] been an evolution of diet they ate
[36:44] rabbits in the days of Luther they ate
[36:45] other things in other days but I want
[36:47] bride aged food I want the food that's
[36:50] from my time from my table for the time
[36:52] I'm living in you he says but now he
[36:56] promised us a full square meal Luther's
[37:00] day they were happy to be in rabbits and
[37:01] they enjoyed especially after those dark
[37:03] ages and the famine for the word of the
[37:05] Lord and the word been held back under
[37:07] the cathodic rule but he gave it a
[37:09] little bit of rabbits in Luther's day a
[37:11] little bit more in Wesley a little bit
[37:12] more under Pentecost but now we've got a
[37:14] full square meal oh I love how he
[37:17] continues the full seven-course meal for
[37:21] all and I'm glad I can you can see it
[37:24] right here in black and white for all
[37:27] the seven seals are opened and
[37:29] everything is ready for the Word of God
[37:32] to those who can receive it's amazing
[37:37] you can read that some people start
[37:38] shaking their heads no no seals aren't
[37:40] open I don't even know what I've
[37:42] wandered into they just I just was told
[37:43] you guys love the word so I'm so then
[37:46] I'm just gonna freak store
[37:48] and if you don't believe the sills are
[37:50] open I just want you to read it from the
[37:52] prophets words he says all the seven
[37:55] seals are opened and everything is ready
[37:57] for the Word of God to those who can
[37:59] receive so we have a seven-course menu
[38:03] as it were we have a full square meal
[38:05] laid out before us and who's it for only
[38:09] for the bride it is only for those who
[38:13] hear his voice and open the door if any
[38:15] man hear my voice and will open the door
[38:18] to me I will come into him and he into
[38:20] me and I will sup with him and he with
[38:22] me this is the day where this transpires
[38:25] and so the bride's feast is a secret
[38:29] feast something to make a believer knows
[38:31] nothing of something nominal Christians
[38:34] do not know it's something that that
[38:36] make believer I labor cannot enjoy now
[38:39] they can pretend to be eating what
[38:40] you're eating but they can't eat what
[38:43] you're eating it's only for the elect
[38:45] it's only for his bride
[38:48] brother manna makes this statement and
[38:50] God as his own interpreter my such a
[38:52] wonderful atmosphere it's a shame I only
[38:54] get 40 minutes he says now that's the
[38:57] word that's prophesied today not
[38:59] Luther's light not Wesley's light and
[39:02] not even the Pentecostal light now we
[39:05] got to have the right attitude because
[39:06] we're not looking down on Luther's life
[39:08] we're not looking down on Wesley's life
[39:10] we're not looking down on even the
[39:12] Pentecostal life don't take a bad
[39:14] attitude towards them you're standing on
[39:16] their shoulders if there wasn't a Luther
[39:19] Thursday we wouldn't be here
[39:20] there wasn't a Wesley state we wouldn't
[39:22] be here if there wasn't a Pentecostal
[39:24] light we wouldn't be here if there
[39:26] hadn't been any of them and we were the
[39:28] bride we'd have to be Luthor's we'd have
[39:31] to be in justification so we can't look
[39:33] back are Pentecostal Pentecost all just
[39:35] forget no no we are bride age because
[39:38] there has been other agents
[39:40] so we don't look down upon him but then
[39:42] we realize as he says that we're not
[39:44] even in the Pentecostal light
[39:46] he says it's gone on up the road now I
[39:50] think of the way that he phrases this
[39:52] it's gone on up the road now it's moved
[39:55] further and as David writes in Psalms 23
[39:59] 1 2 3 the Lord is my shepherd I shall
[40:01] not want and I'm just wanting to amplify
[40:03] how brother BAM says it's gone up the
[40:05] road the light the word has gone up the
[40:08] road so the Lord is my shepherd I shall
[40:10] not want when I was younger I guess I'd
[40:13] never really got the semi-colon I
[40:14] thought the Lord is my shepherd I don't
[40:16] want him I don't know why just I was
[40:18] like this is just really seems odd to me
[40:19] the Lord is my shepherd I don't want but
[40:22] it means the Lord is my shepherd I have
[40:24] I don't have luck he provides all that I
[40:26] need in him I am self-sufficient so he
[40:29] says the Lord is my shepherd therefore
[40:30] I'm not lacking think of what the
[40:32] bride's been given in this hour says he
[40:34] maketh me to lie down
[40:36] catch this in green pastures he leadeth
[40:39] me beside the still waters he is leading
[40:42] me he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in
[40:45] the paths of righteousness for his
[40:47] namesake so there's a shepherd that's
[40:50] leading as he leads he's making sure all
[40:52] your needs are met he's making you lie
[40:55] down by still waters but he leads you
[40:57] there why because it's going on up the
[40:59] road he restores your soul because he
[41:01] leads you in the paths of righteousness
[41:03] he's leading you sees he maketh me to
[41:07] lie down in green pastures at that very
[41:09] phrase it's just green pastures it means
[41:11] new grass now partner that really think
[41:14] really hard now this isn't grass that's
[41:16] been trampled under this isn't grass
[41:19] that Pentecostals doesn't clean down
[41:20] Luther's done clean down he's saying
[41:22] this is new grass this is a field that's
[41:25] never been eaten in before this
[41:28] a posture that he shaved for the elect
[41:30] at the end time as I was leading them
[41:32] out of the Dark Ages they ate over here
[41:34] as I let them further they ate over
[41:36] there but now I brought you to the best
[41:38] crowd now I brought you to a sacred
[41:40] ground now feasting where no one else
[41:42] has ever feasted before brother banner
[41:46] says an invisible Union God has
[41:48] separated us from all the dead religions
[41:50] he says I'm speaking across the nation
[41:53] now all the dead creeds and to what
[41:57] separated us and opened to us a new land
[42:01] this is a new land a new message for
[42:05] this day day that maketh me to lie down
[42:10] in green pastures new grass he says he
[42:14] opened up to us a new land a new message
[42:17] for this day Pentecost dried up and died
[42:19] like Luther and Wesley and the rest of
[42:21] them the life of it is now where it's
[42:24] where the new grass is that's why
[42:26] there's justification there that's why
[42:28] there's sanctification there that's why
[42:30] there's the restoration that gets mapped
[42:31] assaults it's all in this new land he
[42:36] says it's no more than a bunch of
[42:37] churches pulled together good people in
[42:40] there yet has got to be has got to be
[42:42] come out what did he do he opened up the
[42:46] seven seals of the last message after
[42:50] you follow his as he's leading us this
[42:52] is the way the Lord's lis he leadeth me
[42:53] in paths of righteousness he restoreth
[42:56] my soul he leadeth me beside the still
[42:57] waters
[42:58] he's trying to lead you and he's show
[43:00] him the way to go he says Luther's dried
[43:02] up Wesley's dried up Pentecost his dried
[43:04] up he says but he's opened up the seven
[43:06] seals of the last message that's what
[43:08] gets the good people out of it it's the
[43:12] old bit of this word that's what brings
[43:13] the really left out not gathered
[43:16] together little meetings here and there
[43:17] but to really come to the new land to
[43:19] really come to lie down and rest and
[43:21] green pastures this is what brings us
[43:23] out this is what quickens us to life the
[43:26] opening of this word
[43:29] the mess is desperation he speaking how
[43:34] that what God has done in the sari says
[43:36] those great mysteries hidden in the
[43:38] Bible opened up to us on a new field
[43:42] that we never knowed before and
[43:45] perfectly blends into the coming to the
[43:48] Lord Jesus if it perfectly blends in
[43:50] then you don't see the divider and if a
[43:53] carpet layer blends carpet in you don't
[43:55] see the scene so where there's a
[43:57] blending where something blends together
[43:59] he's saying what has been opened up now
[44:01] is a new field I think this is brother
[44:04] branham's words it's maketh me to lie
[44:08] down in green pastures this is new grass
[44:11] a fresh field opened up to us a new land
[44:13] a new message for this day open up the
[44:15] seven seals of the last message opened
[44:17] up to us a new field that we never
[44:19] knowed before you're feeding on
[44:22] something that nobody in the other age
[44:24] is ever known before
[44:25] you could say well they didn't need it
[44:28] in those ages okay that's fine we needed
[44:30] it so we got it so the secret feasts
[44:36] then is connected with the open of the
[44:38] word that's where brother Branham places
[44:41] him so it's a hidden manna something
[44:43] secret that's coming for the bride
[44:45] brother Branham when he's praying at the
[44:47] end of 1962 and he says old God he's
[44:51] he's just praying at the very end there
[44:53] may we'd be one step higher up the
[44:55] ladder until we can see Jesus and his
[44:58] program now what if what a wonderful
[45:01] prayer there at the end of 62 now we
[45:03] have the benefit of looking back and in
[45:06] looking back we know what was
[45:07] approaching brother Branham sensed it as
[45:09] he preached serves is this the time and
[45:10] the sermons that he was preaching around
[45:12] then even shortly afterwards he could
[45:14] sense that something was coming this new
[45:16] ministry which was the open of the word
[45:18] in the open of those seven seals and
[45:20] meeting that constellation of angels out
[45:22] there in Arizona so something within him
[45:24] just stirring and even as a property
[45:26] saying I want to take a step higher up
[45:28] the ladder Lord may you grant this so
[45:30] that we can see Jesus and his program so
[45:34] this was his program here in 1962 s he
[45:37] prays at the end though there's got to
[45:38] be something
[45:39] open up for us and so a little bit a few
[45:42] paragraphs later one paragraph places
[45:44] forgive us and help us we pray raise up
[45:47] mighty men readies up mighty warriors of
[45:50] the faith he says open this year Lord
[45:54] the hidden man what was he looking for
[45:58] this year Lord the hidden manna the rock
[46:01] beneath the rock that we might see the
[46:04] program of God so when he said I want to
[46:07] take a step higher to see the program of
[46:09] God to see Jesus where was it it was
[46:11] something that need to be opened up it
[46:13] was the hidden man it was the rock
[46:14] beneath the rock that's how we would see
[46:16] the program of God I believe God
[46:18] answered his prayer I don't believe the
[46:21] bride is stuck in 1962 a message came in
[46:24] 1963 to help her take a step higher look
[46:27] as she can see Jesus she his program
[46:30] have a hidden manna Graham says in
[46:33] harvest time the hidden man is just for
[46:35] the overcomer only it's a hidden master
[46:38] secret feast and this is bread he's
[46:41] talking about and bread is symbolic of
[46:44] life because it was the substance of
[46:46] living it's what gave the person would
[46:49] eat bread for their substance wasn't
[46:51] always guaranteed meat it was I always
[46:52] guaranteed that but bread and grain
[46:54] there was something that represented
[46:56] life man its strength for life they
[46:58] would eat to live I know that's hard to
[47:01] imagine because many of us lived to eat
[47:03] and I met him guilty as a matter of fact
[47:08] I'll just admit I was looking at good
[47:09] places deed on the drive down it's only
[47:11] a three-hour drive not even three hours
[47:13] but I'm where do I need to go what I
[47:14] need to go eat because it almost seemed
[47:17] to live to eat what are we all here for
[47:19] today anyways I know you didn't come to
[47:22] hear me I thought maybe I just surprise
[47:24] you a little bit to preach my heart out
[47:27] but it's but it's something you should
[47:30] eat to live
[47:32] that's what bread represents I'm eating
[47:35] to live Psalms 27 he said Lord you're
[47:37] the the Lord is the strength of my life
[47:39] he's my bread
[47:40] he's what gives me substance to live and
[47:43] Jesus says in John 648 I am the bread of
[47:46] life
[47:47] so he said I am the bread of life and
[47:50] verse 51 If any man eat of this bread he
[47:52] shall live forever so something about
[47:55] this bread that gives you power over
[47:57] death if you could if you take the whole
[48:00] thing if you could take this bread and
[48:02] eat it and this has special significance
[48:05] in the end time as the Psalms
[48:07] twenty-seven one says the Lord is the
[48:08] strength of my life he's bread at the
[48:10] end time and brother Brahim and the
[48:12] rapture message says what is the shout
[48:14] the Lord himself shall descend with the
[48:16] shout he says it's the message going
[48:18] forth first and he says the Living bread
[48:22] of life bringing forth the bride Christ
[48:26] is that living bread of life it has been
[48:28] opened up to us at the open these seven
[48:31] seals and it's not just something we
[48:32] talk about it's something we eat just as
[48:36] John took that book to meet it and the
[48:38] angel said don't just hold it just don't
[48:40] look at it he said take it and eat it up
[48:43] leave nothing of it behind take it
[48:46] completely let it be processed and
[48:48] assimilated in your bed I want to take
[48:50] this book and eat it all he says take
[48:54] this book and eat it
[48:55] it's the Living bread of life bringing
[48:58] forth the bride that's what this message
[49:00] is the Living bread of life is Christ he
[49:04] says I am the bread of life brother
[49:08] Branham says in wild little Bethlehem we
[49:09] must have something fresh from Christ
[49:12] his word today for this hour
[49:15] he is our freshness our bread that falls
[49:18] every day from heaven upon the believer
[49:20] a man I believe this message is still
[49:23] giving out something fresh we don't have
[49:26] to try to be strange we don't have to
[49:29] try to come up with something new just
[49:30] go back into this go into this message
[49:32] stay with it listen to it
[49:34] read it process it make it something
[49:37] important within your home within your
[49:39] daily lives hello this is life to me
[49:41] this is bread to me uh if I could say it
[49:44] this way and I hope you can understand
[49:46] where I'm trying to place my emphasis we
[49:49] shouldn't just be sitting here twiddling
[49:50] our thumbs hoping that some Jesus is
[49:52] gonna crack this guy and get us out of
[49:54] here
[49:54] he's given us a bread to feed on to lead
[49:56] us to her unseen bridegroom the more we
[50:00] eat the closer we get to me I'm eating
[50:02] to that medium I want to keep eating
[50:04] this bread because it's this bread even
[50:06] as they sang the song in this special
[50:08] scene on this word it'll change your
[50:10] body
[50:10] that's what's gonna do it I'm not
[50:13] waiting for something out there
[50:14] supernatural to happen I want these to
[50:16] omnipotence to me I want this word that
[50:19] I've been given I want to feed on it
[50:21] just changes this body and it's this
[50:26] message we don't need a new man to rise
[50:27] up and give us something to tickle our
[50:29] ears there are no other messengers we've
[50:31] received the last one spiritual food and
[50:37] due season more there's so many things I
[50:38] could have read from this but he says
[50:41] but those who believe God's hour that
[50:43] were living in these things are hidden
[50:45] food amen
[50:48] and he's talking a lot about Elijah
[50:50] Elijah had a he had a secret place he
[50:53] could go he was even in the middle of a
[50:55] famine the middle of everything there's
[50:57] no food
[50:57] he said Elijah had something said these
[51:00] things are hidden food he said just
[51:01] think he's eaten a lot of types with
[51:04] Elijah and Elijah they says God is so
[51:06] hid it that they look right at it and
[51:09] don't see it and sometimes we have to
[51:13] admit some time there's a peer pressure
[51:15] because we're looking at it and we've
[51:17] seen I mean can you believe it that's
[51:20] our Lord up there look at that isn't
[51:23] that amazing what God has done and
[51:24] you're so excited they're just like whoo
[51:26] yeah yeah yeah that's great and they
[51:29] don't even know what you're looking at
[51:30] they just kind of go along with the flow
[51:32] a little bit they just try to make
[51:33] themselves fit in but listen God have so
[51:35] hit it that they look right at it and
[51:38] don't see it the same way that Elijah
[51:40] blinded the Syrian army the same way
[51:43] that God blinds the unbeliever from the
[51:45] true genuine food of the child the
[51:48] believer why it's your secret feast
[51:52] bride has something special she's
[51:55] feeding on in Matthew chapter 24 verses
[51:58] 27 and 28 he find that this chapter
[52:02] there's certainly a lot of prophecies
[52:04] building together and he's talking in
[52:07] Luke 17 it refers to
[52:08] the revealing of the son of man but here
[52:10] it says for as the Lightning cometh out
[52:12] of the east and shines even unto the
[52:13] West so shall also the coming of the Son
[52:16] of man be and then brother branham makes
[52:18] verse 28 a very prominent scripture in
[52:22] his ministry and really gives an
[52:24] interpretation that only a prophet could
[52:26] have brought for wheresoever the carcass
[52:29] is there will the eagle's be gathered
[52:31] together now some translations render it
[52:34] vultures and some theologians talk about
[52:39] different ways of interpreting the
[52:40] Eagles well that rep for the crest of
[52:42] the Roman and they be gathered together
[52:43] around the body of Christ as it hangs
[52:46] upon the cross and only all these
[52:47] different interpretations and we could
[52:49] perhaps take some of those and see see
[52:52] even a compound type there may be a
[52:54] compound fulfillment but then a prophet
[52:56] comes to whom God has given the
[52:57] interpretation and he says that
[52:59] wheresoever the carcase is there will
[53:01] the eagle's be gathered and he's talking
[53:03] about is the word that the eagle has
[53:04] gathered to because the light cometh out
[53:08] of the east and shines even unto the
[53:09] West so shall also the coming of the Son
[53:12] of man be
[53:12] and this coming of the Son of man is
[53:14] going to be a revelation that the Eagles
[53:16] are drawn to it's a light that only they
[53:19] see it's a voice only they hear it's an
[53:22] entrance that's been opened up too hard
[53:24] her load and right there in the presence
[53:27] of her enemies
[53:29] she's feasting as it says in Luke 17
[53:33] wheresoever the body is there that will
[53:36] the eagle's be gathered together brother
[53:39] brother Branham says in question and
[53:41] answers part 1 there in 64 he says we
[53:43] got fresh food today everybody wants
[53:46] something fresh well we've got the
[53:47] freshest as a matter of fact all the
[53:50] fresh food we eat today and wherever you
[53:52] go and get it whether it be your own
[53:53] table at the grocery store farm-to-table
[53:55] whatever it might be the restaurants
[53:57] they don't have it as fresh as we've got
[53:59] it
[53:59] that's the antitype the spiritual food
[54:01] is the true type we've got fresh food
[54:05] today as the original organic
[54:09] listen this is clean provide' they can't
[54:13] touch this certification
[54:15] nothing mixed in no pesticides not

[54:39] where the carcass is hey man that's what
[54:43] we've gathered together for him listen
[54:45] let's just be honest with each other I
[54:46] don't know how far brother Homer
[54:48] Longoria is traveling by the time I
[54:50] don't know how long it is for you to get
[54:51] here it's got to be a ways but what a
[54:53] three hours or so I drove three hours to
[54:55] get here listen we're not just coming

[55:01] that's our bond that's what we have in
[55:04] common that's why we enjoy getting
[55:06] together we might not even remember the
[55:08] food we eat but the word were feasting
[55:10] on that's the strength that binds us
[55:13] together that's why we drive four hours
[55:15] to come here that's why you do it as
[55:17] regularly as you do why because this
[55:20] word needs something to us it's not the
[55:23] potluck that follows it's the Word of
[55:24] God that were feasted on right now that
[55:26] matters talks that's why the Eagles are
[55:31] here if you didn't know it I'm telling

[55:44] you because you're an eagle that's come
[55:46] to this an anointed ones at the end time
[55:51] he says where the fresh meat is the word
[55:54] for the season they're the Eagles will
[55:57] gather where the fresh meat is right
[56:01] he says Eagles is just kind of skipping
[56:03] around in this message Eagles the fresh
[56:05] kill of the word the word that's raised
[56:08] up and fattened and been made manifest
[56:11] and given out to the food for the
[56:13] children that's what I want I want the
[56:15] word that's been raised up and fattened
[56:17] that's the saying I don't want to eat
[56:19] the soup made of the shadow of the
[56:22] chicken that start starving to death or
[56:23] something like that
[56:24] I just moved to North Carolina so I need
[56:26] to learn all these sayings you know
[56:30] there's different ones I've tried to
[56:31] learn through the years that that's so
[56:33] good you put on your forehead beat
[56:34] yourself to death with your tongue
[56:35] things like that you know I treat you so
[56:41] many ways you're bound to like one of
[56:42] them you know there's all these
[56:43] different things you hear the fresh kill
[56:48] of the word word that's raised up and
[56:51] fattened and then he's and then he's
[56:53] he's talked about how you can't feed
[56:55] dead things rotten things to the to the
[56:57] to an eagle and even talks about how
[56:59] that dove it just can't go and eat on
[57:01] the things that a crow can it uses those
[57:04] types many times and then he makes this
[57:06] statement neither can you feed the bride
[57:08] of Jesus Christ Pentecostalism and I let
[57:11] me emphasize this Pentecostalism isn't
[57:13] just the way you're seeing your songs it
[57:16] doesn't have to do with worship how loud
[57:18] the music gives or the style of music
[57:19] Pentecostalism is a failure to go all
[57:21] the way in God's Word
[57:23] Pentecostalism is not walking in the
[57:25] light of God's Word he says neither can
[57:29] you feed the bride of Jesus Christ
[57:31] Pentecostalism no indeedy maggot blood
[57:33] organizations nothing doing no no he
[57:37] says the fresh meat that comes from the
[57:39] throne that's what we want we want the
[57:41] fresh meat that comes from the throne
[57:44] praise the Lord and the message it is
[57:47] the rising of the Sun he says a genuine
[57:49] quicken eagle lives by that that's what
[57:53] you got to recognize a genuine quickened
[57:56] eagle lives by that I believe you're all
[57:58] Eagles today yeah whether you're living
[58:01] by this or not and if you're not living
[58:03] by it you just need to be quickened oh
[58:06] you might we might see young people
[58:08] young couples young families where
[58:10] they're just not quite living by that
[58:12] yet they just need to be quickened says
[58:14] he raised up Christ from the grave dwell
[58:16] in you has quickened your mortal body
[58:18] unto his presence you recognize it
[58:20] you're no longer a scavenger think of
[58:24] that story talks about that Eagle here
[58:25] in the barnyard
[58:27] as long as it
[58:28] is that for all the time that it was in
[58:30] the barnyard it was always an eagle and
[58:34] have you thought about it every single
[58:38] one of those chickens had a vested
[58:40] interest in making sure the Eagle never
[58:43] recognized who it was because Eagles eat
[58:48] chickens so every single one of those
[58:52] chickens are going on don't you say
[58:53] anything about how different he looks
[58:55] look one day chickens look anything like
[59:00] this so do you see fires I'm just gonna
[59:07] eat you and you're going around saying I
[59:10] don't get it I don't enjoy this stuff
[59:12] they enjoy I don't feel like they feel
[59:14] in their own oh you're just a chicken
[59:15] now you're just a chicken now but is it
[59:19] really an eagle why because they had
[59:21] something to lose why because the Eagles
[59:28] want it fresh and can identify with that
[59:35] voice and you right back to go to get
[59:40] chickens I'm Scott I live there I know
[59:43] where they hide I know what times they
[59:46] leave the coop God works all things for
[59:49] our good oh those years you lived in the
[59:52] barnyard God's gonna use it for an
[59:54] eagle's good don't you ever regret it
[59:57] don't you look back and think that God
[59:58] wasn't with you once God's quickens you
[1:00:01] he'll use all of it
[1:00:02] [Applause]
[1:00:03] he says you're no longer scavenger he
[1:00:06] says you're an eagle you don't want the
[1:00:09] things of the world you're a son and
[1:00:12] daughter of God
[1:00:13] your feasting at a fountain oh I love
[1:00:16] this you're feasting at a fountain that
[1:00:18] the world knows nothing about
[1:00:21] he says you're drinking it the world
[1:00:24] knows nothing about it's a secret feast
[1:00:28] he says you're eating hidden manna that
[1:00:31] the world never even know nothing about
[1:00:36] I don't mind all the negatives never
[1:00:38] even know nothing that's right they
[1:00:43] never even know nothing he says for you
[1:00:47] are an eagle he says that in a couple
[1:00:51] times you're an eagle you're an eagle
[1:00:53] young people don't try to get satisfied
[1:00:55] on the things of this world it'll never
[1:00:56] satisfy it can sensitize you for a
[1:00:59] little while it can excite you for a
[1:01:00] moment but it'll never satisfy there'll
[1:01:03] be a little something happen it'll get
[1:01:05] you by for a day but how do you feel the
[1:01:07] next day listen but this word this
[1:01:09] manner that's available to these things
[1:01:11] that you can feed on it satisfies listen
[1:01:15] when you're in the world and you do the
[1:01:16] dirt of the world I don't tell you how
[1:01:18] many times you wake up say I never want
[1:01:20] to do that again but if you ever come in
[1:01:23] contact with something supernatural no
[1:01:25] matter how much it feels you no matter
[1:01:27] how much it thrills you once you've come
[1:01:29] through that you say I can't wait to get
[1:01:31] it again I can't wait to feel that again
[1:01:33] I can't wait to do that again why it's
[1:01:36] what you bomb to says you're an eagle
[1:01:41] hey man I'll wrap it up with this
[1:01:44] statement this is my last one so I hope
[1:01:47] these other brothers showed up or we're
[1:01:48] gonna be eaten sooner sooner than later
[1:01:50] milligram says an anointed ones at the
[1:01:53] end time he says the son of man is
[1:01:55] Christ he is the one that you're feeding
[1:02:02] says you're not feeding on a man his
[1:02:05] words will fail
[1:02:07] I'm brother bana made it very very clear
[1:02:09] he is I've a son a man revealing decent
[1:02:12] of man so he's not pointing to himself
[1:02:15] we know you can't separate the message
[1:02:17] from the messenger and we should never
[1:02:19] try to do that but then brother Branham
[1:02:21] makes a statement right here in teaching
[1:02:24] on the a son of man indeed something he
[1:02:25] says can you get it separated now so
[1:02:29] there's a point you can't separate them
[1:02:31] but there's a point at which you that
[1:02:33] messengers message is successful and
[1:02:36] he's delivered the message and then you
[1:02:38] can get it separated properly if you try
[1:02:42] to separate it to get the message you'll
[1:02:43] never get it but once you get the
[1:02:45] message you can see it separated you can
[1:02:47] see who he is and you can see Christ
[1:02:49] that he's introduced you to he is the
[1:02:51] one that you're feeding on you're not
[1:02:53] feeding on a man a man his words will
[1:02:55] fail but you're feeding on the unfailing
[1:02:58] body word of the Son of Man that's what
[1:03:02] you're feeding on this is the bride's
[1:03:04] secret feast and I appreciate this
[1:03:09] statement here he says if you haven't
[1:03:10] fed fully on every word to give yourself
[1:03:14] strength to fly above all these
[1:03:16] denominations and things of the world he
[1:03:18] says will you do it at this time will
[1:03:20] you at this time do it while we pray I
[1:03:23] wonder if we could bow our heads for a
[1:03:25] moment and before I turn it over to
[1:03:27] brother Samuel or whoever is going to be
[1:03:30] coming next if in these few moments 30
[1:03:33] 40 minutes that I've just been
[1:03:35] expressing these things that were
[1:03:37] impressed upon my heart if you know you
[1:03:39] haven't taken your place at this table
[1:03:41] and you'd want to do so I'd invite you
[1:03:44] to I didn't like you now as a young
[1:03:48] person if you know you haven't said Lord
[1:03:51] Here I am I know I've heard this message
[1:03:53] feast and I've heard these quotes and
[1:03:56] these terminologies and something's
[1:03:57] stirring in your heart saying man just
[1:03:59] as you were preaching brother harun it
[1:04:02] felt like my identity was was drawing
[1:04:04] near to me I there's something I
[1:04:06] identified with would there be someone
[1:04:08] here if it's not a young person maybe if
[1:04:10] somebody who's back slid maybe a young
[1:04:12] man or young woman maybe somebody who
[1:04:15] just wants to say
[1:04:16] whose Lord I've drawn I'm being drawn to
[1:04:18] this table I've never taken my place but
[1:04:21] I want to give you an opportunity to
[1:04:22] stand
[1:04:25] you're not gonna bother me if it's not
[1:04:27] gonna bother me if no one stands as long
[1:04:29] as you have a piece in your heart that
[1:04:31] you shouldn't I'm okay with that I don't
[1:04:35] need I don't need someone to stand to
[1:04:36] vindicate this or anything but what I
[1:04:37] want to do is I want to impress upon you
[1:04:39] now before we pray if you want to be at
[1:04:41] this table would you be willing to
[1:04:43] surrender your heart to him now
[1:04:44] [Music]
[1:04:45] do you want to feed on every word to
[1:04:48] give yourself strength to fly above
[1:04:49] these things of the world that's why
[1:04:52] they have such a pull on you is you
[1:04:54] haven't sat at the right table yet I'll
[1:04:56] give you one more opportunity anybody
[1:04:58] would want to stand so let I want to
[1:05:00] take a place at this table praise the
[1:05:04] Lord he says while we pray let me just
[1:05:07] pray for you now gracious Heavenly
[1:05:09] Father Laura it is a thrill to me to be
[1:05:12] able to speak on these things
[1:05:13] to come together with people I have it
[1:05:16] fellowship with Lord to stand behind a
[1:05:18] desk that I've never preached behind to
[1:05:20] stand before people which is the
[1:05:22] greatest privilege it's not the desk I
[1:05:24] stand behind but the people I stand
[1:05:25] before but I've never had a chance to
[1:05:27] minister to and to lift up this word
[1:05:30] this bread this strong meat that we have
[1:05:33] in this in time and Lord I believe
[1:05:35] there's power in this bread I believe
[1:05:37] there's strengthened this food and Lord
[1:05:40] if there be any who've never taken their
[1:05:42] place at the table made tonight they
[1:05:44] know the invitation is open that you're

[1:05:55] this world knows nothing about and

[1:06:03] disciplined at the feast and orders we
[1:06:05] have an opportunity to be together for a
[1:06:07] few more hours and fellowshipping and

[1:06:19] strength to them may they be reminded
[1:06:21] that there's a source that they can go
[1:06:22] back to that the sermons that are
[1:06:24] preached over this pulpit are not just
[1:06:26] the words of a man but it's men of God
[1:06:28] lifting up the voice together that
[1:06:31] they're breaking down this body word of
[1:06:33] the son of man for us to feed upon that
[1:06:35] there's a source and in tapes and mp3s
[1:06:37] and books that we can go to and all of
[1:06:39] it collectively is working together to

[1:08:54] Tom and greet the people and bring your
[1:08:56] singing
[1:09:01] praise the Lord did you enjoy that my oh
[1:09:05] my you know I'm just astounded at the
[1:09:09] word the freshness of it the wonderful
[1:09:11] power of it you know I hadn't seen my
[1:09:14] brother in about 20 years
[1:09:15] I guess it's been and I heard him when
[1:09:17] he first started to preach and he was an
[1:09:19] eagle then he's got a few more bigger
[1:09:22] feathers and I'm just real pleased you
[1:09:25] know and just to say it again you know
[1:09:27] his dad is a great minister too but his
[1:09:30] dad shouldn't have been either his dad
[1:09:31] was actually a warlock to start but God
[1:09:35] had something else in mind and what is a
[1:09:38] vindication of the message of the hour
[1:09:39] if it's fine if dad has it but it's a
[1:09:42] son's not gonna automatically get it but
[1:09:45] this son got it that son got it and I'm
[1:09:48] just proud of brother brother Aaron just
[1:09:50] wonderful proclamation right in the
[1:09:53] midst of the enemy we get to feed on the
[1:09:55] Word of God you know I was thinking
[1:09:57] today we're living in almost in the age
[1:09:59] of accusation you know during the entire
[1:10:02] time except for about a year or so of
[1:10:05] Noah preaching he was being accused of
[1:10:07] being wrong and truth be told science
[1:10:10] was proving him wrong for a hundred and
[1:10:11] some years all the philosophers were
[1:10:14] proving him wrong every week though err
[1:10:17] was Noah with an anointed message and
[1:10:19] you go down a little further and you see
[1:10:22] Israel in there pushing on that mud
[1:10:24] trying to make bricks and there was a
[1:10:26] prophecy that went out and it was a
[1:10:28] false one for 400 years but after that
[1:10:32] it become a real true one and they were
[1:10:34] under the notion that that prophecy that
[1:10:37] Israel would be given freedom that it
[1:10:41] was false and hundreds of years passed
[1:10:44] and it looked false and then we step
[1:10:47] ahead in future a little bit and there's
[1:10:49] a man doing a great work for God
[1:10:50] arresting Christians and he was doing an
[1:10:53] astounding job and he was very well
[1:10:55] learned and he was capable politically
[1:10:58] and socially and religiously and you
[1:11:00] know all of
[1:11:01] sudden though he went crazy he kind of
[1:11:03] he he joined a cult and and and they're
[1:11:08] chasing him the majority of his life to
[1:11:10] capture them they beat him up this ship
[1:11:12] wrecked him they beat him up again they
[1:11:13] thought he was left him for dead he come
[1:11:15] back alive and they couldn't get him
[1:11:17] stop talking finally king of grips is my
[1:11:19] Paul all this learnings kind of made you
[1:11:21] man and they were under the assumption
[1:11:24] that he was mad but little did they
[1:11:26] realize that Paul's anointing Paul's
[1:11:28] word would be writing a majority of the
[1:11:31] New Testament because it was right amen
[1:11:35] so here we are in the end time and we
[1:11:38] there's never been an age of accusation
[1:11:40] like this age and and never has there
[1:11:42] been a table set in the presence of our
[1:11:45] enemies we're being accused politically
[1:11:48] no matter is if someone hates somebody
[1:11:50] they're wrong no matter what they do and
[1:11:52] religiously you know it's going to type
[1:11:54] the same thing as politics is it's all
[1:11:57] accusation it's all there's just no
[1:12:01] faithfulness but there will be a truth
[1:12:05] amen you know they're tearing up the
[1:12:07] Constitution of our country and into
[1:12:10] shreds but it's still holding its own
[1:12:12] they're tearing up the gospel of Jesus
[1:12:15] Christ there's websites all over now
[1:12:17] telling you all the mistakes in the
[1:12:19] Bible brothers sister feed on the Bible
[1:12:22] it'll be all right there's there's a
[1:12:24] voice is all over once again picking on
[1:12:27] the prophet of the hour saying he's
[1:12:28] false and they seem their anointing just
[1:12:31] seems right and now you got to pronounce
[1:12:33] Jesus some Hebrew way and you've got to
[1:12:37] believe this you kind of believe that
[1:12:38] give me the old time gospel because this
[1:12:41] bride has been sealed with the Holy
[1:12:45] Ghost this bride just wasn't sealed
[1:12:47] under justification she's sealed with
[1:12:49] sanctification and the baptism of the
[1:12:51] Holy Ghost and the person of Christ
[1:12:54] himself and you you can't deny who you
[1:12:57] are just look at and stretch them out
[1:12:59] and fly and my what a powerful sermon we
[1:13:02] heard today it wasn't even exactly
[1:13:04] preach and it was more a declaration of
[1:13:07] what we believe that sermon and that
[1:13:09] sermon alone could change lives in a
[1:13:11] world where
[1:13:12] we are hearing so much information that
[1:13:14] will change nothing it has become
[1:13:17] scientifically the accepted word that
[1:13:21] there's global warming and my it just
[1:13:23] they're not understanding warming we
[1:13:28] have changed so much in what people
[1:13:30] consider truth and how they're aging
[1:13:33] things I heard something Iraq was seven
[1:13:36] billion years old I put on the internet
[1:13:38] you sure it couldn't have been six point
[1:13:40] five billion years old men guessing at
[1:13:43] what is truth
[1:13:44] men claiming to have truth why do you
[1:13:48] believe the message of the hour it's
[1:13:51] because what it's done to us it is I
[1:13:55] cannot say the message would be false it
[1:13:58] would be to say the very life that I've
[1:14:00] been given is false it would be to deny
[1:14:03] that a den of X warlock could become a
[1:14:06] pastor who could have a son who could
[1:14:08] become a declare of the truth to the to
[1:14:11] the stature I just I just love sitting
[1:14:13] behind that man of God many people teach
[1:14:17] a lot of things and then go off on the
[1:14:19] word well I like hearing somebody that
[1:14:21] can teach and still say amen to all the
[1:14:24] Word of God amen
[1:14:25] so say amen to the word of the Lord were
[1:14:27] uh I haven't been gone or I still
[1:14:30] believe the message I still have enough
[1:14:31] peanut butter to make it to church we
[1:14:34] love everybody we're gonna see our day
[1:14:37] of fulfillment man I remember you Elijah
[1:14:39] sent to serve and you go up to the hill
[1:14:41] and you tell me when you see a cloud I
[1:14:43] don't see anything they look again I see
[1:14:46] a cloud but it's such a little thing he
[1:14:48] says I see the abundance of rain amen
[1:14:51] and God's standard that is raising up is
[1:14:54] the final voice to this final age which
[1:14:56] will be you and me
[1:14:57] so say Amen to all the Word of God in it
[1:15:01] I just loved what he said about the
[1:15:03] eagle those chickens had a vested
[1:15:05] interest
[1:15:07] you know I like it too but you know the
[1:15:10] only ones that didn't know he was an
[1:15:12] eagle was him and I imagine even those
[1:15:15] foxes you know and some of the enemies
[1:15:17] that well you know that that's not an
[1:15:19] eagle but I'm not gonna tell him
[1:15:21] although you know there it's quite a
[1:15:24] blessing to have that data
[1:15:25] ego in that coupe amen but the Eagle
[1:15:28] come loose amen I can't wait to rise up
[1:15:31] with the Lord we might not see each
