[0:00] House of
[0:02] God. See if we can get this squared away
[0:25] here. Certainly good to have brother
[0:27] Daniel with with us.
[0:32] I knew he was coming. I just didn't know
[0:34] when. It's always good to see you,
[0:37] brother Daniel. See your smiling face.
[0:40] Praise the Lord. All right. Let's see if
[0:43] we can get this going.
[0:46] Okay. All
[0:49] right. I guess that's not going to
[0:53] work. Let's try this way.
[0:59] All right. Can you see
[1:01] that? Okay. Let's just bow our heads
[1:04] this morning. Heavenly Father, we thank
[1:06] you, Lord, once again for the
[1:08] opportunity that you've given us to be
[1:09] in the house of God, to worship you in
[1:11] spirit and in truth, Lord. Father,
[1:14] to look at some of these things, Father,
[1:17] that you've placed in your word. And we
[1:19] ask, Lord, that you would just uh anoint
[1:21] our lips, forgive us for our sins, Lord
[1:24] Jesus. And Lord, may you just have your
[1:26] way here this morning. Help us, Lord, to
[1:28] receive something from you. We ask these
[1:30] things now in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:33] Amen. I just want to talk this morning a
[1:35] little bit about Christ's
[1:37] preeminence. Um I want to title it a
[1:41] prisoner to Christ's
[1:43] preeminence. Amen. And um I've just been
[1:46] thinking a a lot about the preeminence
[1:49] of God and um about how we should be how
[1:53] we should we as Christians is our uh
[1:57] duty to be to to give Christ amen our
[2:00] full preeminence in all of our lives.
[2:02] And so we're we'll we'll touch upon in
[2:04] just a moment about what what that means
[2:07] and um and we can just go from there. So
[2:12] um in Colossians 1 15-20 it says this
[2:16] who is who is the image of the invisible
[2:19] God the firstborn of every cre of every
[2:22] creature and this of course is talking
[2:24] about Jesus
[2:25] Christ. For by him were all things
[2:29] created that are in heaven and that are
[2:32] in earth visible and invisible whether
[2:35] they be thrones or dominions or
[2:37] principalities or powers. All things
[2:40] were created by him and for him. Amen.
[2:45] And he is before all things. In other
[2:49] words, he it it's it's hard to fathom
[2:52] that because we're always thinking in
[2:54] the mindset of something's born and then
[2:56] something dies. Something's born,
[2:58] something dies. Something born. And and
[3:00] to think that something has always been
[3:03] there, eternal, never had a beginning,
[3:06] never had an end, that's that that
[3:08] almost rattles the mind. You can't
[3:11] fathom that. You can't think that far.
[3:14] But that is that is our limitations that
[3:17] God placed us so we can give him the
[3:20] preeminence in our lives. Amen. Because
[3:22] he we can't think that far, but he can.
[3:26] Amen. Praise God.
[3:28] And he is before all things. And by all
[3:31] things
[3:33] uh and by him all things consist. And he
[3:37] is the head of the body of the church
[3:41] who is the beginning, the firstborn from
[3:44] the dead, that in all things he might
[3:46] have the preeminence. And this is what
[3:48] it says in the in the New Living uh
[3:51] translation. I like the way it says it
[3:53] there.
[3:54] It says Christ is also the head of the
[3:57] church which is his body. He is the
[4:00] beginning supreme overall who rise from
[4:04] the dead. So he is first in everything.
[4:08] Right? And I want I just want you to to
[4:12] think about that and I want you to ask
[4:13] yourself is he first in everything in
[4:16] your life? Is he first in because he's
[4:20] first in everything, right? But is he
[4:22] first in everything in your
[4:24] life? Because if he's the head of the
[4:27] body and if the body is connected to the
[4:30] head, wherever the head moves, that's
[4:33] where the body should go to, right? My
[4:37] head doesn't move this way. And my body
[4:39] stays right over here. My body tends to
[4:41] want to move where my head goes.
[4:43] Right? So that's exactly where what
[4:47] where wherever he goes, I will follow.
[4:49] Amen.
[4:51] Praise the Lord. For it pleased the
[4:53] Father that in him should all fullness
[4:56] dwell. And having made peace through the
[4:59] blood of his cross by him to reconcile
[5:02] all things unto himself. By him I say,
[5:05] whether they be things in earth or
[5:07] things in
[5:08] heaven. So that's the that's the end of
[5:10] the scripture there. Now, this is what
[5:12] the word preeminence means. And I
[5:14] apologize for the slides not being in
[5:17] nice order. You know, brother Bob does
[5:20] it in such a better way, but
[5:23] uh um preeminence refers to the state of
[5:27] being superior to or having precedence
[5:30] over others, holding the highest rank or
[5:34] importance or priority in a particular
[5:36] context. It describes something or
[5:39] someone that stands above all others in
[5:41] authority, significance or influence.
[5:45] Amen. So these are some of the aspects
[5:47] of what preeminence includes.
[5:49] Superiority, having qualities, abilities
[5:52] or characteristics that exceed those of
[5:54] others in the same category. Think think
[5:57] for example uh uh your boss at at work.
[6:00] He has the
[6:02] preeminence over certain aspects of of
[6:05] of your of your uh position there,
[6:08] right?
[6:10] You go to him for certain aspects now
[6:12] and then he might have a boss un over
[6:15] him and that boss has the preeminence
[6:17] over him and over you as well. Right. So
[6:22] um that's what that's what preeminence
[6:24] means. Amen. Um being given first place
[6:28] or highest consideration and decisions,
[6:31] attention or resources. Amen. I believe
[6:34] Jesus Christ, he deserves first place.
[6:37] Amen. He he and we'll look at it here in
[6:40] just a moment, but he he gave it all. He
[6:43] gave the father the preeminence in his
[6:46] life, right? He said, "I can do nothing
[6:48] unless the father shows me first. I I'm
[6:52] not going to do anything. I'm not going
[6:53] to step into my own opinions. I'm not
[6:56] going to do I might have I might think
[6:57] of something in a certain way, but amen,
[7:00] I I'm I'm bound by the word, right? And
[7:03] if it's not in the word, Amen. I'm not
[7:05] going to move. I'm not going to proceed.
[7:08] And so, and so if the head could have
[7:10] done that, him being the head, how much
[7:13] more the body Amen. should do the exact
[7:16] same thing because the body is connected
[7:18] to the head, right? Amen. Praise the
[7:20] Lord. Amen. He's the what we what did we
[7:24] just read? He is the creator of heavens
[7:26] and earth. Everything. Amen. Oh. Oh,
[7:29] that's just God. Amen. But he is God,
[7:31] right? And God condescended down. Amen.
[7:34] into your form. He gave up all the the
[7:37] the the the glory of heaven. He gave up
[7:39] at the splendor of heaven, everything
[7:41] that that he didn't have to do it, but
[7:44] he did. Amen.
[7:46] And he gave up himself. He could have
[7:48] had a wife. He could have had a a
[7:50] children. He could have he could have
[7:52] enjoyed a good job or, you know, like
[7:55] you and I could, but he gave all the
[7:57] preeminence to the word or to the
[8:00] father. Praise the Lord.
[8:03] Authority. Uh this is another thing with
[8:06] the word uh another uh definition of the
[8:10] word uh preeminence. Authority
[8:11] possessing recognized power or influence
[8:15] that others defer to distinction being
[8:18] clearly set apart from others due to
[8:20] excellence or importance. Amen. And I
[8:23] believe I believe that Jesus Christ
[8:26] gives that distinction amen to to his
[8:29] his fellow believers. Amen. That's the
[8:32] reason why um we we as Christians, Amen,
[8:35] we we we act differently, we dress
[8:38] differently, we we we we talk
[8:41] differently, amen, we we we live
[8:43] differently,
[8:45] right? Because there has to be a
[8:47] distinction. There has to be a
[8:49] preeminence, amen, to to uh to to God.
[8:53] Amen. In everything that in everything
[8:55] that we do, he's the primacy holding
[8:57] first place or the leading position in a
[9:01] hierarchy or order. Amen.
[9:04] So we know that these are the qualities
[9:07] of Jesus Christ. Amen. Everything that
[9:11] we just read, he fulfilled in the word
[9:14] of God. Amen. He fulfilled in his life
[9:16] when he came here as uh as an and
[9:20] experienced human flesh. Amen. human
[9:22] beings just like you and I. Amen. And
[9:24] that's the reason why he can say that he
[9:26] can be touched by the feeling of our
[9:29] infirmities. Now, we always think of the
[9:32] word infirmity as some as a sickness,
[9:34] but it's not necessarily just a
[9:36] sickness. Amen. He can be touched by the
[9:38] feeling of your
[9:40] frailty of of how weak you are of how of
[9:44] of the things that you go to go through
[9:47] the thoughts that run across your mind.
[9:49] Amen. when when at different moments of
[9:51] the day. Amen. When you're supposed to
[9:53] be going down to pray and and and then
[9:56] you start thinking about the laundry,
[9:59] just didn't think about it any other
[10:00] time, but just when you pray, right?
[10:04] Then think about, you know, that that
[10:06] part that you got to buy a AutoZone for
[10:08] the car and and at any moment. Amen. But
[10:11] at that right at that moment, you see,
[10:13] Jesus probably had to battle had mind
[10:16] battles as well, right? We know that he
[10:19] did because he didn't want to go and
[10:21] die. Amen. As a human, he didn't want
[10:24] to. Amen. But he said, "Father, not my
[10:26] will, but but thy will be done." Why?
[10:29] Because you take the preeminence, Lord.
[10:32] I want you to have the
[10:34] preeminence. Amen. So, he gave up all
[10:37] the splendor of glory to in order to
[10:39] have that human experience with you and
[10:41] me. Amen. That's why he can be the head.
[10:45] That's why he is the head. Because the
[10:48] head my head is connected to my body.
[10:51] It's it's a human head, not a horse
[10:54] head.
[10:55] It's not a It's not It's not a an
[10:57] animal's head. Amen. To on a human body.
[10:59] Amen. It's the same quality, the same
[11:02] thing. Right. It's a human brain. I hope
[11:05] so. I think my wife would think that.
[11:11] So in Colossians 1 uh we just read 15-20
[11:15] he obtained all these aspects of
[11:18] preeminence by growing into them. All
[11:21] right. I want you to understand that
[11:24] Jesus Christ though he he was all God
[11:28] and though but yet he was all human.
[11:31] Amen. And the Bible says in Luke that he
[11:33] had to grow in in wisdom and in maturity
[11:37] as well.
[11:39] So he didn't know all things when he
[11:41] came here on earth. That's right. All
[11:44] right.
[11:46] Amen. In Revelations he said it says
[11:48] that that that the the re in Revelation
[11:50] one the revelation of Jesus Christ which
[11:53] God gave to him. That's right. He didn't
[11:55] know it at one point. The human I'm I'm
[11:58] speaking about the human aspect of of
[12:00] Jesus. He didn't know all things. He had
[12:03] to come and grow and learn. And I know
[12:05] that sounds kind of strange, but maybe
[12:07] we can just let the prophet tell you
[12:09] about it because look what Hebrews 7, I
[12:12] know this is kind of small, but I really
[12:15] apologize. Blow it up here a little bit.
[12:18] says, "Who in the days of his flesh,
[12:20] when he had offered up prayers and
[12:22] supplications with strong crying and
[12:25] tears unto him that was able to save him
[12:27] from death, and was heard in that he
[12:30] feared. Though he were a son, yet he
[12:34] learned he obedience, yet learned he
[12:37] obedience by the things what?"
[12:41] Oh, it doesn't say all the blessings
[12:42] that he received.
[12:45] every good day that he had,
[12:49] uh, you know, every good restaurant he
[12:51] was able to to eat at and, uh, money
[12:54] rolling in in the bank. And, uh,
[12:57] no, he said, though he were a son, he
[13:00] was a son, yet he learned obedience by
[13:03] the things which he suffered.
[13:07] Amen. That's right. And being made
[13:08] perfect, he became the author of eternal
[13:11] salvation unto all them that obey
[13:15] him. Amen. That's you and I. Called of
[13:19] God and high priest after the order of
[13:23] Melchazdc. Amen. Praise the Lord
[13:27] Jesus. So Jesus, he limited himself to
[13:31] the human
[13:33] experience. Though he were God, though
[13:36] he was God.
[13:38] Amen. As God, Jesus did not need to
[13:41] learn anything, especially obedience.
[13:44] Yet at his incarnation, Jesus limited
[13:47] himself to the human experience. I like
[13:50] this. He chose the weak position of
[13:52] having to learn and grow. Amen. And we
[13:55] read that in Luke
[13:57] 2:52. Amen. Just like you and I. Why?
[14:01] because he's the head,
[14:04] right? And the head experiences what the
[14:08] body experiences. Amen. The body
[14:12] experiences what the head experiences,
[14:14] right? Every every every pain that you
[14:18] that your body goes through,
[14:21] right? Your head or your brain is given
[14:24] signals for that. Right. Right. There's
[14:28] a connection there. And that's why that
[14:30] there cannot be a disconnect between the
[14:32] body of Christ and the head of Christ.
[14:35] Right? Because he is the
[14:38] head. So Jesus did not know all things.
[14:42] Amen. He grew in knowledge and
[14:47] wisdom. I say, "Wow, he did not know all
[14:50] things." No, he did not know all things
[14:52] as as as human as as in his human
[14:56] experience. He did not know all things.
[14:59] That's why he said I can do nothing
[15:02] unless the my father shows me first.
[15:06] That that that's what differentiates him
[15:09] in the aspect of him being human but yet
[15:11] being God at the same time. We knew the
[15:14] we know the fullness of God dwelleth in
[15:16] him. Right?
[15:19] He was he was all God and he and and and
[15:22] Isaiah prophesied that it was going to
[15:24] be God with us. Amen. Because there was
[15:26] no one else that could save us but the
[15:28] blood of God. Amen. That's right. I'm
[15:30] saved by the blood of God. Amen. I'm not
[15:33] saved by just a prophet's blood. Amen.
[15:35] Or or or or or some man's blood. Amen.
[15:38] We we are kept saved. Amen. By that
[15:40] blood. Praise the Lord Jesus.
[15:43] And it's got to be the blood of God.
[15:44] Amen. Or else Amen. We're still living
[15:46] in in our sins. If it's not God's blood,
[15:50] Amen. that came in. Amen. Praise the
[15:52] Lord. If it wasn't his uh uh his
[15:56] sacrifice, Amen. then we are still
[15:58] living in our sins. But I thank God that
[16:01] it's a finished work.
[16:03] Amen. The brother Brandham says in the
[16:06] revelation of Jesus Christ, he says the
[16:08] following. See if we can blow it up here
[16:11] just a little bit.
[16:15] He said, "Now I said, now I said that
[16:18] this book of revelation is the
[16:19] revelation of Jesus and what he is doing
[16:22] in the churches for those seven ages. It
[16:26] is a revelation because the disciples
[16:28] themselves didn't know these recorded
[16:31] truths." All right? It had not been
[16:34] previously revealed to them. You
[16:37] remember that they came to Jesus in the
[16:39] book of Acts and asked him, "Are you at
[16:42] this time going to restore the kingdom
[16:44] to Israel?" See, because the disciples,
[16:46] they were looking for a physical
[16:48] kingdom, right? Where Jesus didn't come
[16:50] to establish a physical
[16:53] kingdom. Jesus doesn't care about a
[16:56] physical kingdom
[16:57] because that's easy for him to obtain.
[16:59] Right. He's he's more concerned about
[17:02] your kingdom. Amen.
[17:05] Because that's harder for that's a
[17:06] little tougher. It's not tough for him.
[17:08] It's just it it's tougher because we
[17:11] don't want to give him the preeminence.
[17:13] He the whole earth is his and they obey
[17:16] him at his command. The animals,
[17:19] mountains, the trees, everything.
[17:22] They're subject to him. We are the
[17:24] hardheads. That's right. Amen. And he's
[17:26] the one that he's the one he's always
[17:30] having to deal with us. But yet that is
[17:32] the reason why his mercy and grace is
[17:35] never I'm so glad his mercy and grace
[17:37] always abounds. Praise the Lord. We are
[17:41] hard-headed. We don't learn. We don't we
[17:44] we want to do it our way and we're
[17:46] always seeking something
[17:49] physical. You know, that's why it's so
[17:52] important. Amen. And in the hour that
[17:54] we're living in, do not get caught up
[17:56] with physical kingdoms.
[17:58] These kingdoms of the earth will pass
[18:00] away. Amen. Heaven and earth will pass
[18:04] away, but my my word, Amen, which is
[18:07] God, will not pass away.
[18:10] And he said, "It is not for you," this
[18:14] is what Jesus said, "It is not for you
[18:15] to know the times or the seasons." Those
[18:19] men were still thinking of Jesus having
[18:21] an earthly kingdom, but it was a
[18:22] spiritual kingdom that he was going to
[18:25] build. This is brother Brandham still
[18:28] speaking. He said even he what it says
[18:32] even he could not tell them about his
[18:35] place in it for the father had not
[18:38] revealed it unto him.
[18:41] Right? So Jesus didn't know until the
[18:44] father revealed it to him to to him
[18:46] first. Now when he died and resurrected,
[18:49] Amen. And he said all heaven and earth,
[18:52] all everything in heaven and earth,
[18:54] amen, is is uh belongs to me. Amen. He
[18:57] knew all things.
[19:00] Praise the Lord. But he had to conquer
[19:03] first.
[19:04] Amen. He had to do his
[19:06] duty. Praise the
[19:08] Lord. He says he's his place in it for
[19:11] the father had not revealed it unto him.
[19:13] But now after his death and resurrection
[19:16] and at this particular time in his
[19:19] mediatorial ministry, he is able to set
[19:22] forth here in this revelation of himself
[19:25] to John what his glory and presence in
[19:28] the church would mean and do. Amen. Let
[19:30] me go a
[19:32] little.
[19:34] Amen. The father was what took
[19:37] preeminence in Jesus' life. Amen. He
[19:39] says, "I can do nothing on my own." In
[19:41] John 5:30, as I hear, I judge, and my
[19:44] judgment is just because I seek not my
[19:46] own will, but the will of him who sent
[19:48] me. Let's just skip a few of these here
[19:51] for the sake of
[19:53] time. Amen. So, if the head had to give
[19:56] the preeminence to the to the
[19:58] intelligence, Amen. So does the body,
[20:01] right? Amen. We know Jesus is the head.
[20:05] But as him him being here on earth,
[20:08] Amen. He had to give preeminence to the
[20:10] intelligence which was the father,
[20:12] right? Which was the brain, right?
[20:15] Because I I have a head, right? But we
[20:18] have a brain that controls the head,
[20:20] right? So it wasn't just about the head.
[20:24] Amen. But it was about the intelligence
[20:26] working through the head and that
[20:28] intelligence. Amen. That int uh that
[20:31] head, Amen, connected to the body. So
[20:33] it's all one unit, right? Praise the
[20:36] Lord Jesus. Colossians 1:18 says, "And
[20:38] he is the head of the body, the church
[20:41] who is the beginning, the firstborn from
[20:43] the dead, that in all things he might
[20:45] have the preeminence." Amen. He wants
[20:47] the preeminence in all things in your
[20:49] life.
[20:51] Amen. He He has the preeminence in all
[20:53] things, right? We know that he's the God
[20:55] of heaven and earth. Amen. But does he
[20:57] have the preeminence in your life? Have
[21:00] you given him all the preeminence?
[21:03] Maybe there's some doors, amen, that you
[21:05] still haven't opened up to him yet,
[21:09] right? He wants everything. Not because
[21:12] he wants to uh enslave you or because he
[21:15] wants Amen. He just He wants Amen. so
[21:18] that you don't be enslaved by nothing
[21:20] else. And when he has full control that
[21:23] there's nothing else that can enslave
[21:25] you. Amen. Praise God. Amen.
[21:28] This is this is in just a moment we'll
[21:30] look here at at
[21:32] Paul. Amen. So while Jesus was in flesh
[21:35] on earth the intelligence the brain uh
[21:38] the father took the
[21:40] preeminence Jesus the head submitting
[21:43] submitted himself to the intelligence
[21:45] and the body which is us the church the
[21:47] bride submits to the head intelligence.
[21:50] Right? I have this little diagram here.
[21:53] This is the
[21:55] body. Amen. the father, the
[21:57] intelligence, the brain while Jesus was
[22:00] here on earth. Amen. He him being the
[22:04] head but could not come to being the
[22:07] head until he first did his mediatorial
[22:10] work, right? As dying and resurrecting
[22:14] and paying for our sins. Amen. That's
[22:16] when he he he became he said, "I go I
[22:20] came from the father and I go back to
[22:22] the father." Right. Right. It was the
[22:24] father the whole time. Right. That's
[22:26] right. Praise the Lord Jesus. And then
[22:28] the church, the body, the church bride
[22:31] submits to the head or the intelligence,
[22:35] right? Kind of interesting that that
[22:37] that that it's where the neck
[22:40] is, right? From the neck down, that's
[22:43] that's that's that's the bride. That's
[22:45] the
[22:46] church,
[22:48] right? You know, sometimes they they say
[22:52] a a man says, "I'm the head of the
[22:54] house." And then the woman says, "But
[22:56] I'm the neck that moves the
[23:00] head, so you can't do without either
[23:03] [Laughter]
[23:05] one." All right.
[23:09] And and us brothers
[23:12] say, "Nobody said it."
[23:16] That's right.
[23:18] You know better.
[23:21] All right. Let's let's look at this here
[23:22] for just a moment. Paul, a prisoner of
[23:24] Jesus Christ. Now Paul in Ephesians 3:1,
[23:28] "For this reason I, Paul, a prisoner of
[23:32] Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles,"
[23:35] he says
[23:36] this in Ephesians 4:1, he says, "I
[23:39] therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, urge
[23:41] you to walk in a manner worthy of the
[23:43] calling to which you have been called."
[23:45] You know, in some places he called
[23:47] himself an apostle. In some places he
[23:49] called the servant of Jesus Christ. He
[23:51] called himself. But in in in other
[23:53] places he called himself I therefore the
[23:56] prisoner. Now a prisoner Amen. He's he
[23:59] has given himself h wholly to the
[24:02] system. Right.
[24:05] He he he has no a prisoner when you
[24:07] think of a prison a prisoner he has he
[24:10] has no rights of his own. Right. Right.
[24:14] He has nothing of his own. He's
[24:16] completely stripped away of all his
[24:19] rights in order to only do what is given
[24:22] him to do what is told to him to do. In
[24:26] Phileiman 1:1, Paul a prisoner for
[24:28] Christ Jesus and Timothy our brother to
[24:30] Phileiman in Phileiman 1:9. Yet for
[24:32] love's sake I prefer to appeal to you. I
[24:34] Paul an old man and now a prisoner also
[24:37] for Christ Jesus. Now we know that Paul
[24:41] he called himself that prisoner of
[24:43] Christ.
[24:44] Um, and this was both real and spiritual
[24:47] for Paul. We know that he he he was he
[24:51] was in prisons all the time. But what
[24:54] was causing him to go to prisons, amen,
[24:56] was for the love of Christ, for the he
[24:58] had given God the preeminence already.
[25:01] And let me tell you, when you give God
[25:03] the preeminence, man, the you're going
[25:06] to you're going to uh uh you're going to
[25:09] have trials. You're going to be
[25:10] persecuted.
[25:12] Not everyone's going to like you.
[25:15] Right. And certainly the devil is going
[25:17] to be behind is going to be after you.
[25:20] And this was the case with Paul. And and
[25:22] and there's a theme in the Bible. Amen.
[25:24] That that that before you people gave
[25:27] themselves gave the preeminence to God,
[25:30] they had to be knocked off their high
[25:32] horse first.
[25:34] Just like Paul did. Paul was full too
[25:37] much of
[25:38] himself. He had to be stripped away.
[25:41] Same thing with Joseph. Same thing with
[25:43] Moses. And brother Brandham talks about
[25:45] this in that message of prisoner.
[25:49] They had to be they had to be stripped
[25:51] away of everything that they were in
[25:53] order to fully give God the preeminence.
[25:56] Amen.
[25:58] Praise the Lord. He was literally Paul
[26:01] was literally in Roman prisons all the
[26:04] time.
[26:05] And and this is kind
[26:08] of something the way the the way Paul
[26:11] describes in some verses of the way he
[26:13] was in he was under house arrest. And
[26:17] the way house arrest would work is is
[26:19] they would have to the prisoner
[26:22] especially if they were citizens of
[26:24] Rome. They were given a little better
[26:26] better treatment.
[26:28] But the way that it would work is that
[26:30] they would have to rent their own place
[26:32] to be to be a prisoner in.
[26:36] They were not given a place by Rome.
[26:38] They were they would they'd had to
[26:40] choose a place or uh uh and I'm sure
[26:43] there was some stipulations there. But
[26:45] at the same time, Paul always had to
[26:48] have a Roman guard tied to him all the
[26:52] time.
[26:54] So his left hand or his right hand was
[26:58] always chained up to a to a Roman
[27:00] soldier for eight hour eight hour ships,
[27:03] four to eight hour
[27:05] ships. And that's why Paul talks about
[27:07] I'm a prisoner of Christ because he took
[27:10] what he was going through and he
[27:13] spiritualized it. He he he made he he
[27:16] was going through something bad but yet
[27:18] he used it. Amen. For the glory of God.
[27:22] Because even though he was he was he was
[27:24] in prison or even though he was in tied
[27:27] up to a Roman soldier constantly
[27:29] watching him all the time, he could
[27:31] still write letters. He could still have
[27:33] visitors. He could still so he he was
[27:36] able to still testify. That's why he
[27:38] wrote all these letters of these books
[27:40] that we that we write that we read. He
[27:42] wrote Phileiman and all these different
[27:44] books. And so the Roman soldier,
[27:47] everything that Paul did, everything
[27:48] that Paul spoke, everything that the
[27:50] Roman soldier was there listening the
[27:52] whole time.
[27:54] Every soldier and and then in one
[27:56] scripture he says uh I greet you uh the
[28:00] um I'm just kind of paraphrasing. He
[28:02] says the the house of Cornelius or the
[28:05] house of of of Caesar sends greetings to
[28:08] you as well. In other words, they were
[28:10] talking amongst themselves about what
[28:12] Paul believed about his writings and
[28:15] about everything. So, you might be in a
[28:17] bad condition. You might be you might
[28:19] feel like like you're you're you're in a
[28:22] a spiritual uh uh you know, a tri a
[28:25] trial. Amen. But but look at the bright
[28:29] side. Look look what is it that God is
[28:31] doing. Amen. It might be your Roman your
[28:34] Roman soldier tied to you right there.
[28:36] Amen. But that Amen. He he we don't know
[28:39] what God is doing. God probably tied
[28:42] certain Roman soldiers to to Paul so
[28:44] that they could get converted,
[28:46] right?
[28:48] And so that Roman soldier where wherever
[28:52] Paul didn't have any privacy at all and
[28:55] he knew that therefore he took advantage
[28:57] of the situation.
[29:00] Well, if I'm not going to have any
[29:01] privacy, I'm not going to do wherever I
[29:03] go, he goes. Wherever Whatever I read,
[29:06] he reads. whatever I write, he's he's
[29:08] looking at. Well, then I'm just going to
[29:10] just just be the best witness that I
[29:12] can. Amen. And that's what Paul did.
[29:15] Amen. I wonder if we can think about
[29:18] that. If we can give God the preeminence
[29:20] in that way, Lord, I may not have the
[29:23] control of everything in my life, but
[29:26] whatever I can do, I'm just going to
[29:27] make the best of it.
[29:30] Make the best of the situation of that
[29:33] that I'm in. And Lord, you take the
[29:36] preeminence in my life.
[29:39] Amen. Can can you imagine just being
[29:42] tied and look that Roman soldier just
[29:44] there looking at at what Paul and I'm
[29:46] sure like how can this man write the
[29:49] things that he's
[29:50] writing? How can this man talk the way
[29:53] he's talking and yet be under under
[29:57] under p under chains?
[30:00] He said he said that's why he said in
[30:02] some places uh don't be ashamed of my
[30:05] chains
[30:07] because he was proud of his chains.
[30:09] Amen. Sometimes we get caught up in
[30:12] chains of circumstances in this life and
[30:14] we want people to feel bad for our
[30:16] chains but you were the one who got
[30:18] yourself into that. Amen. And then you
[30:21] want somebody to get you out.
[30:24] Amen.
[30:26] You you have a father that can help you
[30:28] out. Amen. But he wants to Amen. let you
[30:31] know. Amen. That you got something to do
[30:33] in order to get yourself out. Amen. Go
[30:36] repent.
[30:38] Amen. That's right. Praise God. Go do
[30:41] those. Go do what you need to do first.
[30:43] Then I can help you out of these chains.
[30:46] Praise the Lord. But Paul, Amen. He was
[30:48] in these chains because for doing good.
[30:51] For doing good. He also felt completely
[30:54] given over to Jesus. Amen. So I'm just
[30:56] going to fast forward still. here for
[30:59] the sake of time. Ask yourself, amen.
[31:02] Have I truly given my life to Jesus? Am
[31:05] I a prisoner of
[31:07] Christ? Amen. This is a personal
[31:11] question for everyone.
[31:13] Amen. Because this is the hour, the hour
[31:16] that we're living in. Amen. We need to
[31:18] make sure that we've given him all the
[31:21] preeminence in our lives. Amen. Praise
[31:24] the Lord Jesus. Just have the musicians
[31:26] come. Amen. We appreciate the the
[31:29] attention.
[31:31] [Applause]
