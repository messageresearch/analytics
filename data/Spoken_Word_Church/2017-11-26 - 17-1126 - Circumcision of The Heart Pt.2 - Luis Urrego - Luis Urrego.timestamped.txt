[0:16] so it was happy you and it's great yeah
[0:26] there you go okay alright so we're gonna
[0:35] continue the part two of circumcision of
[0:39] the heart and this might lead into a
[0:41] part three but I'm not gonna be able to
[0:43] huh I'm not gonna be able to - oh yeah
[0:50] that's not oh it's not working oh they
[0:54] are having an issue with the microphone
[0:56] so anyways let's continue where we left
[1:00] off last time we might let it end up
[1:04] leading to a part 3 after there this is
[1:06] part two but then was this might held to
[1:08] a part three because but I'm not gonna
[1:10] be able to do part three until maybe
[1:12] February because brother Aaron he's
[1:15] taking all of next month and I think for
[1:18] the Ryan you're taking January okay
[1:21] his brother Bob is taking January I'm
[1:23] taking all February and then brother Ron
[1:26] is taking March all right so we're gonna
[1:34] continue where we left off last week
[1:40] just slide this over that was good by
[1:52] the way
[1:57] thank you all right
[2:03] so last time we left off by talking
[2:05] about job for Chapter five and if you
[2:07] were here to service on Tuesday we spoke
[2:09] about this and what the significance of
[2:15] this was in regards to our day now so if
[2:21] the this is when the children of Israel
[2:23] had crossed over into the Promised Land
[2:26] and at at that crossing after that
[2:30] crossing was when the Lord told them to
[2:32] told Joshua to go ahead and circumcise
[2:35] the children of Israel the second time
[2:38] so again God instituted a circumcision
[2:43] at the beginning with Abraham continued
[2:47] it on with Moses and then continued it
[2:49] on here with the third messenger I guess
[2:52] you could say here with Joshua and so
[2:56] God had never forgotten about his
[2:58] original word about circumcision it was
[3:01] continuing on you see even with Joshua
[3:03] so we read that last Sunday I'm not
[3:05] going to read that so the children of
[3:08] Israel were in full obedience and the
[3:10] reason why I read this and I put these
[3:11] is because it's quicker to read them
[3:13] especially because we're still limited
[3:14] on on Sunday mornings that's the reason
[3:17] I just read it you just read with me and
[3:20] then I'll just explain a few things the
[3:23] children of Israel there were in full
[3:24] obedience after they were circumcised
[3:26] for the second time and after they had
[3:29] crossed over into the promised land
[3:31] under the leadership of Joshua and Caleb
[3:34] and it was after after that we have
[3:37] believed God's promise and that and
[3:40] after we've stepped into that promise by
[3:41] faith then God can go to circumcise in
[3:45] our hearts all right we know that the
[3:47] Holy Spirit is the token he is the one
[3:49] who does
[3:50] circumcising right a lot of people think
[3:53] I need to change from the ins from the
[3:55] outside in before I can come to Christ
[3:57] but that's not the case
[3:59] God wants one God wants to reiax God
[4:02] wants to have you the way you are just
[4:03] as the song goes just as I am that's how
[4:06] I come to the Lord you know God that's
[4:08] how he wants you because he's the one
[4:10] who's gonna be doing the circumcised
[4:11] right
[4:12] you can't circumcise yourself right
[4:14] spiritually it's it's tough for somebody
[4:18] you know many times you think oh I'll do
[4:21] better tomorrow I'll do it I'll do and
[4:23] then you fall again the same thing in
[4:25] the same rut and it's a constant rut you
[4:28] know what I've learned what I've learned
[4:29] is if you just let the word before you
[4:32] and you just let God like David said
[4:35] David said I always put the Lord before
[4:38] me what is what it was the Lord the Lord
[4:41] is the word and he said I always put the
[4:43] words before me and when the word is
[4:46] fighting for you then you don't have to
[4:48] fight them
[4:49] you see he's doing the work for you and
[4:52] to me that is that is like the more time
[4:57] you you take to to be involved in the
[5:02] things of God the less time you're doing
[5:05] things for the world things for yourself
[5:08] you see what I'm saying be involved
[5:10] something I'm not I'm not just talking
[5:12] about that church what I'm talking about
[5:14] at home get involved with something
[5:17] because it's usually at the time when
[5:19] we're bored or when we have nothing in
[5:21] our mind that we get involved in doing
[5:23] something we're not supposed to be
[5:24] commended right I mean I just picked
[5:26] that for experience yeah and so when you
[5:29] get involved getting the word get put on
[5:33] a message you have children get involved
[5:35] with your children something spiritual
[5:37] do something that involves the word the
[5:40] word will fight for you and after a
[5:43] while you know you start having more
[5:44] victories in your life over that
[5:46] whatever that is in your life you see
[5:48] Amen so so after we have believed God's
[5:52] promise and stepped into that promise by
[5:55] faith then God can go to circumcise in
[5:57] our hearts Holy Spirit and then we'll be
[5:59] enjoy the benefits of guts that God's
[6:01] Spirit brings see it was after they had
[6:03] crossed over into the Promised Land it
[6:05] was when God told them circumcise Joshua
[6:09] circumcise their children for the second
[6:11] time because look as I said Tuesday you
[6:14] can be in this message forever a long
[6:19] time and you still not have the Holy
[6:22] Spirit in your life you still not have
[6:24] the new birth but yet you have all
[6:26] knowledge all of you that will not take
[6:29] you anywhere that that will not bring
[6:32] victories in your life but when you know
[6:34] and your anchor this word is anchored in
[6:36] your heart amen there's not even not a
[6:39] devil in hell can get you out of it you
[6:42] say that because I mean how can you
[6:43] explain people being in the message for
[6:45] 40 50 years and then one day they just
[6:48] get up and say I don't believe it
[6:49] anymore because the message was not in
[6:52] them that's right
[6:53] right message was all up here we don't
[6:56] want just intellectual knowledge sure
[6:58] you have to have intellectual knowledge
[7:00] and then that knowledge turns into a
[7:03] revelation because a lot of people say
[7:05] well you have to have a revelation but
[7:07] really you have to receive it in your
[7:09] mind first right then that can turn down
[7:12] and then it can turn into into a new
[7:14] revelation but a lot of people just have
[7:16] it up here and that's it
[7:18] and what did Malachi 4 say he said I
[7:21] will turn you say will turn the hardest
[7:23] of the children not their minds the
[7:27] hearts of the children back that's well
[7:28] that's what God wants to do he wants to
[7:30] heart amen
[7:32] Joshua chapter 5 verse 10 it says in the
[7:35] children of Israel encamped in Gilgal
[7:37] and kept the Passover the eating of the
[7:40] lamb which is Jesus on the fourteenth
[7:42] day of the month this was after the
[7:44] circumcision then they took they they
[7:47] they had the Passover they kept the
[7:49] Passover you know that the Passover is
[7:51] when they ate the lamb back in the
[7:54] Exodus before they exited out of out of
[7:56] Egypt and and the only way that we're
[8:01] gonna be able to enjoy feeding off the
[8:03] lamb is if the one
[8:05] the lamp is in us in the form of the
[8:08] Holy Spirit because the Holy Spirit
[8:09] cannot feed on anything else but himself
[8:13] so now I've didn't get to this on
[8:18] Tuesday but forgot to mention this but
[8:21] verse 11 says and they did eat of the
[8:23] old corn of the land on tomorrow after
[8:25] the Passover unleavened cakes in parched
[8:28] corn in the self-same day
[8:29] verse 12 and the manna ceased on the
[8:32] morrow after they had eaten of the old
[8:34] corn of the land so here is where the
[8:36] manna stopped falling for them it was
[8:39] after they had crossed over and the
[8:41] circumcision had taken place they were
[8:44] in full opinions and that milk food in
[8:49] other words soft soft food had ceased
[8:53] they were mature in other words they
[8:56] just type them things out they were
[8:58] matured in full obedience and the Bible
[9:02] says here says but they did eat of the
[9:04] fruit of the land of Canaan that year so
[9:07] they were they were eating strong meat
[9:08] now see very evening meat now and that's
[9:12] the thing you know there's got to be a
[9:14] point where you're just not feeding just
[9:15] on milk but at the same time I say this
[9:19] you can't stop because when you eat meat
[9:22] or you drink or when you when you eat
[9:24] food sometimes I'd like to have a glass
[9:26] of milk with my food as well you can't
[9:30] stop just drinking the foundations of
[9:32] the word you see you have to have the
[9:34] foundations there but also be able to
[9:37] upgrade to the to the more of God the
[9:42] strong meat and but a lot of people have
[9:45] where they just they're just eating the
[9:47] foundations and that's it no no long
[9:49] hair don't cut your hair no makeup and
[9:52] you know then all these things but then
[9:55] they can't go ahead of that they can't
[9:57] go past that you see there's a lot more
[10:00] involved in the word man that's just the
[10:01] foundation that's just milk
[10:04] and so but we need both of them still
[10:06] throughout the Christian life we need a
[10:08] balanced duck right
[10:11] praise the Lord so the children of
[10:14] Israel enjoyed the benefits of this
[10:15] promised land which is the Holy Ghost
[10:17] after they were full opinions to God
[10:19] because remember the promised land when
[10:22] they crossed over is not heaven is not
[10:27] the Millennium why because they still
[10:32] have battles and struggles in that land
[10:35] problems they still have to go conquer
[10:38] Jericho right yeah so it's not the
[10:41] Promised Land I mean it's not the
[10:43] Millenium or heaven so the only way
[10:46] Israel was a Macross over if the
[10:48] Promised Land was by crossing it take
[10:51] God at His Word take and just do it you
[10:55] see and sometimes it's tough for us
[10:59] maybe as Christians am I am I gonna
[11:01] overcome this or whatever you know what
[11:04] take out his word just do it
[11:06] just go at it you know now spiritual
[11:12] circumcision is the results of receiving
[11:14] the token now what is the token Holy
[11:19] Ghost exactly it's the sign amen well so
[11:24] what was circumcision well to Abraham it
[11:26] was it was to be a token as a sign right
[11:28] but uh brother Brent says he remember
[11:33] the Covenant blood the Covenant blood is
[11:35] not recognized without the token you
[11:39] cannot you will not you say well I've
[11:41] been sanctified from things that's not
[11:44] the token so you can you can be can be
[11:47] cleaned from things but still be a
[11:50] Pharisee Pharisees believed clean but
[11:54] then the day they they could not see the
[11:56] the word sent for their day amen which
[12:00] was Jesus Christ that's not the Tilton
[12:03] look what he says it's the Spirit it's
[12:05] the token the Spirit of Christ upon you
[12:08] believe it the token is the sign that
[12:10] the purchase has been made and been
[12:12] accepted now you can't get the token
[12:14] from the railroad fare until you pay the
[12:17] price and the only way you're going to
[12:19] pay the price is paid
[12:21] that's why I said above I said the only
[12:25] way is real is a bird across the promise
[12:26] I was by crossing you think that's right
[12:30] what believe it accepted full obedience
[12:32] to the whole Word of God will entitle
[12:34] you to the token that's what Jesus said
[12:38] the father sends the Holy Ghost to them
[12:41] that believed that obey Him right full
[12:45] obedience not the part of it as far as
[12:47] your denomination goes but all of it
[12:49] full obedience to the word which is
[12:51] Christ brings you into Christ
[12:54] now what if what if you was just all in
[12:57] but your feet hanging out what if you
[13:00] was all in with hands hanging out most
[13:03] all of us in but the heart hanging out
[13:05] see the heart is the hearts in the world
[13:08] yet see but we don't do that full
[13:10] complete obedience puts you in the word
[13:12] one you believe every bit and all of it
[13:15] it's in you and you watch it working
[13:17] through you so the Covenant of
[13:21] circumcision that God gave to Abraham
[13:23] was to be a universal blessing because
[13:26] it was to be for Abraham see alright and
[13:30] Abraham seed extends beyond just his
[13:33] physical seed all right but it has to do
[13:37] with his spiritual seed as well that's
[13:39] why spiritual circumcision is a
[13:41] universal blessing as well we are the
[13:44] spiritual seed of Abraham wave we're not
[13:48] the physical seed of Abraham but we are
[13:50] the spiritual seed of Abraham by faith
[13:53] because Abraham took God by faith and
[13:56] what he was doing I mean like I said
[13:58] last Sunday
[13:58] can you imagine God talking to you and
[14:01] telling you leave this leave your
[14:04] hometown leave the town or wherever you
[14:07] live leave leave Athens and go move to
[14:09] another city or another country that you
[14:11] know nothing about and in God said and
[14:14] I'll lead you okay Lord they made me
[14:19] know his name or nothing but yet still
[14:22] took by faith except that what he was
[14:26] saying that's what we do
[14:31] so since this is a universal blessing
[14:35] acts 2:38 4 to 30 to 39 was read 38 then
[14:41] Peter said unto them repent and be
[14:42] baptized every one of you in the name of
[14:44] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[14:45] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[14:48] Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the token
[14:50] for the promise is unto you and to your
[14:53] children and to all there are far off
[14:55] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[14:58] call so there's no there's no limit
[15:00] there right there's no limit to but of
[15:05] course Jesus Christ knows who will and
[15:07] who won't be except right therefore he
[15:10] could predestinate accordingly right so
[15:13] faith in God's Word is what Abraham's
[15:16] seed possesses amen
[15:21] now look look what wrote look what Paul
[15:26] says here in Romans and he Abraham
[15:30] received the sign of circumcision a seal
[15:33] of the righteousness of the faith which
[15:36] he had yet being uncircumcised this
[15:40] faith that Abraham had he had it before
[15:45] the actual sign came to paint the beam
[15:47] that's what Paul is saying that he might
[15:51] be the father of all them that believe
[15:53] that's including us right so Paul is
[15:58] talking about that faith right though
[16:02] they be not circumcised he's talking
[16:06] about physical circumcision that
[16:08] righteousness might be imputed unto them
[16:11] also and the father of circumcision to
[16:16] them who are not of the circumcision
[16:18] only in other words to the Jews right
[16:22] but who also walk in the steps of that
[16:24] faith of our father Abraham which he had
[16:28] being yet uncircumcised
[16:31] because the Jews hold circumcision so
[16:33] strongly but Paul is here is talking in
[16:37] saying
[16:38] listen circumcision has nothing to do
[16:40] with you receiving Christ's physical
[16:42] circumcision has to do it has to do it's
[16:48] it's you can be uncircumcised and yet be
[16:52] a believer in Christ
[16:54] physically verse 13 for the promise that
[16:58] he should be the heir of the world was
[17:00] not to Abraham or to his seed physically
[17:04] through the law through the law but
[17:06] through the righteousness of faith all
[17:09] right for if they which are of the law
[17:12] be heirs then faith is made void so in
[17:16] other words if it was just for the
[17:17] physical seed of Abraham then was to use
[17:20] for us to exercise faith right in this
[17:24] hour it's what Paul is saying faith is
[17:27] for not that faith is in that invalid
[17:29] and the promise made of none effect so
[17:33] we wouldn't be able to receive the
[17:34] promise because none of us have been
[17:36] circumcised you know not always have
[17:39] been circumcised physically because the
[17:42] law worketh wrath for where no law is
[17:46] there is no transgression therefore it
[17:49] is a faith that it might be by grace to
[17:52] the end the promise might be sure to all
[17:55] deceive amen
[17:57] not to that only which is of the law but
[18:01] to that also which is of the faith of
[18:03] Abraham who is the father of us all amen
[18:10] you know and whenever you get the time
[18:12] read Romans the book of Romans it's so
[18:15] it's so good so circumcision was was to
[18:20] set the seed of Abraham and Israel apart
[18:22] from the rest of the nations and and it
[18:25] wasn't necessary for Israel to
[18:27] physically prove to the whole world that
[18:29] they were circumcised but it was by the
[18:32] works and the things that they were
[18:33] doing although that physical sign was
[18:36] there but it was by the works and the
[18:38] things and they were doing in the signs
[18:39] that were
[18:40] around them that proved that they
[18:43] belonged to something different or
[18:45] somebody different right there were
[18:50] different people so we don't go around
[18:54] with a Sun on our back saying that we
[18:55] are Christians all right
[18:59] your life will prove whether you're a
[19:01] Christian or not it's your life yeah I
[19:06] remember brother Brandon when he said up
[19:08] when he was talking about if Jesus
[19:10] Christ was standing here today you he
[19:14] wouldn't be wearing a robe and
[19:16] Palestinian garments and stuff like that
[19:18] no he fit right in with the people right
[19:22] but people be like people people would
[19:24] probably wouldn't accept it and like nah
[19:26] he looks like a common person you know
[19:28] right common man you know but he'd fit
[19:31] right in here brother and said he'd be
[19:33] wearing a suit and tie you don't have to
[19:39] a lot of people think that you have to
[19:41] act all you know me y'all different and
[19:45] you know dress different and you know
[19:47] you have to act different of course but
[19:49] be y'all dress different and it you know
[19:52] to look humble that's not the case I
[19:55] mean God made us in different ways
[19:57] that's right some I was like things that
[19:59] with some of them don't they meant but
[20:01] you don't have to be all out there you
[20:04] know to say I'm a Christian you know no
[20:06] just be who you are a man leave got
[20:09] college means I don't
[20:15] now I want you to look at this member
[20:17] guavamama number of public me and
[20:19] brother Bob we were first was talking to
[20:21] brother Paul me and brother Bob where he
[20:25] brought this to my attention and I
[20:26] thought this was really good because if
[20:29] you read an Acts chapter 16 I was just
[20:32] reading here real quick it says then
[20:33] came he to Derbe and Lystra and behold a
[20:37] certain disciple was there named
[20:38] timotheus the son of a certain woman
[20:41] which was a Jewess and believed that his
[20:44] father was a Greek
[20:45] so timotheus mom was a Jewess a Jewish
[20:49] lady but his father was a Greek so in
[20:51] other words a Gentile so he was a human
[20:57] color cement I guess you could say if if
[21:05] he lived in that area right if you lived
[21:07] in some area but so he was half to half
[21:11] Greek now verse 2 says which was well
[21:13] reported of by the Brethren that were at
[21:16] Lystra and Iconium him would Paul have
[21:19] to go forth with him and took and
[21:21] circumcised them because of the Jews
[21:23] which were in those quarters for they
[21:26] knew all that his father was a Greek
[21:28] so Paul wanted to take timotheus with
[21:30] him to the ministry but he was afraid
[21:33] that the Jews were going to say
[21:34] something this man is half Gentile and I
[21:37] don't think he circumcised so how do you
[21:40] think how do you how do you think they
[21:45] would they would approve that he was
[21:50] circumcised other than physically
[21:52] showing right but I don't think man
[21:55] would be going around showing all
[21:57] constantly you know you see so this is
[22:03] interesting
[22:06] so there's the question how would the
[22:09] Jews know if timotheus had been
[22:10] circumcised or not circumcised to the
[22:15] Jews so being Greek people just
[22:22] automatically knew that that's right
[22:27] that's the reason why Paul was afraid to
[22:28] take the monkeyest with with me because
[22:31] of the Jews what they would think so he
[22:33] he certainly he had him circumcised it's
[22:36] what we just read right well there's a
[22:40] well the physical circumcision alone
[22:42] would not have been sufficient for the
[22:43] Jews see they wouldn't have even
[22:45] accepted that just just to show that
[22:49] that was done you see the brie ceremony
[22:53] would have had to have been observed so
[22:55] there would have been a mohel or mo l to
[22:58] testify now what is a mo L a mole is an
[23:04] expert in the surgical aspects of
[23:06] circumcision as well as knowledgeable in
[23:09] the laws of and customs pertaining to a
[23:11] traditional circumcision and ceremony a
[23:14] mo L is a person who is certified to be
[23:18] capable and not knowledgeable in both
[23:21] the surgical aspects of performing
[23:23] circumcision as well as the traditional
[23:25] aspects of performing a kosher
[23:27] circumcision and the traditional
[23:29] ceremony so they would have the Jews
[23:32] would have to go to the melt MOA who
[23:34] circumsized timotheus to say was this
[23:37] really take place
[23:38] can you certify that this really took
[23:40] place and they would have if he of the
[23:42] mo L really did it then he would have to
[23:44] so yes I did perform the circumcision
[23:47] and that man was always believed you see
[23:50] they couldn't argue with that man
[23:51] because he was certified in doing that
[23:53] and he was there so Timothy as they have
[23:57] to physically show the Jews they could
[23:59] just go to the mole and ask him right
[24:01] and who is our mole for today when the
[24:04] when the world is a
[24:06] Demming us and and satan comes to you
[24:09] and says you know your your look what
[24:12] you're doing look what you're not doing
[24:15] Amen armorless Christ that he managed
[24:18] man he's testifying on our back Oh amen
[24:22] and praise God I just thought that was
[24:25] beautiful wait man hey man look what
[24:27] first John 2:1 says my little children
[24:29] these things write unto you that ye sin
[24:31] not and if any man sin we have an
[24:33] advocate with the father Jesus Christ
[24:35] the righteous we have an advocate a man
[24:38] that moil is like the habit and right
[24:40] he's speaking for our behalf he's
[24:43] certified in all those ways in that
[24:45] spiritual circumcision right he knows
[24:49] hmm the first Timothy 2:15 for there is
[24:54] one God and one mediator between God and
[24:56] man the man Christ Jesus and Hebrews 8:6
[25:01] but now have he obtained a more
[25:03] excellent ministry by how much also he
[25:06] is the mediator of a better covenant
[25:09] this is the better covenant that he's
[25:12] talking about his spiritual circumcision
[25:15] right
[25:18] which was established upon better
[25:20] promises praise the Lord
[25:23] so I thought I'd throw that in there
[25:26] because God the Holy Spirit dwelling in
[25:31] you Jesus Christ that Holy Spirit will
[25:35] testify
[25:35] amen if you do have so from the
[25:43] beginning this this is what God really
[25:45] wanted a circumcision of the heart and
[25:48] he didn't this wasn't something just
[25:50] that that was that was mentioned in the
[25:52] New Testament this was also something
[25:54] this was actually mentioned in the Old
[25:56] Testament men wasn't sin and what they
[26:01] really needed was a change of heart not
[26:03] a cover-up of sins but God had to start
[26:06] that way first because again he had to
[26:09] he had to start from the beginning from
[26:10] the foundation and men were physical and
[26:13] that's how they they acted you know like
[26:15] I said last Sunday they were rough back
[26:17] then you know they were they it was
[26:19] physical everything was physical for
[26:21] them and for the old time God is looking
[26:27] is looking at the heart they met and
[26:29] look even in Deuteronomy 30 I'll skip
[26:32] down to verse 6 over verse success and
[26:34] the LORD thy God will circumcise dying
[26:37] heart so even in the Old Testament he's
[26:40] already speaking about circumcision of
[26:41] the heart
[26:42] not this job not just physical
[26:45] circumcision he's talking about
[26:46] circumcision in the heart and the heart
[26:48] of thy seed to love the Lord thy God
[26:51] with all thine heart and with all thy
[26:53] soul that thou mayst live so he asked
[26:58] that in the Ten Commandments love that
[27:00] love thy God with all thy heart died
[27:02] like soul I like strength right but
[27:06] really that couldn't be done unless it
[27:08] was actually physically from the heart I
[27:10] know
[27:10] actually from the heart right you know
[27:13] because if that if that really took
[27:15] place from the heart the the Pharisees
[27:18] wouldn't have rejected Jesus Christ the
[27:20] way they did they just had it on the
[27:22] physical physical the flesh but they
[27:25] didn't have the spiritual aspect of and
[27:27] they would have never rejected the
[27:28] Messiah mmm
[27:31] praise God so God's intention from the
[27:37] beginning was to have the heart
[27:39] circumcised amen
[27:42] now once you're circumcised the hardest
[27:46] chains it's been altered right not
[27:50] physically but spiritually you've been
[27:53] altered when you come to Jesus Christ
[27:55] you're not the same Amen you're not the
[27:58] same and all things are passed away
[28:02] behold all things are new rightfully so
[28:06] when a physical circumcision I'm not
[28:08] trying to be disgusting here but
[28:10] understand what I'm trying to say I
[28:12] brought this out at a church one time
[28:14] and I guess I kind of worded it wrong
[28:19] and I had some sisters they were they
[28:23] were laughing while I was I'm sitting
[28:26] there preaching this so I kind of
[28:29] changed the wording here around a little
[28:31] bit but when physical circumcision takes
[28:34] place there was an alteration in the
[28:37] man's Anatomy right we're all adults
[28:40] here all right and you couldn't go back
[28:45] to the way the man's member was before
[28:47] the physical circumcision took place
[28:48] right there's no way to go back to it
[28:51] it's been altered it's been it's been
[28:53] altered so you couldn't go back to the
[28:55] way things were right not it not no not
[29:00] as much as the man might want to you
[29:03] couldn't go back to the way things were
[29:05] right the same thing with the Holy Ghost
[29:09] once your heart has been circumcised and
[29:11] your spirit renata me has been altered
[29:12] by Christ and there's no way you can go
[29:16] back to the way things were before and
[29:17] feel comfortable
[29:19] all right I feel comfortable you can't
[29:23] there's no way you may you yes you're
[29:28] growing yeah you might fall you're gonna
[29:30] make mistakes amen
[29:32] but you couldn't quickly repent okay
[29:34] something in you is like I got it I got
[29:36] it I gotta take care of this quickly you
[29:39] don't feel right anymore I don't feel
[29:41] right doing things if I fall into into
[29:44] things that you know something says wait
[29:48] a second that that's not that's not me
[29:51] anymore
[29:51] that's not meaning right we've all
[29:54] experienced that and you'll feel out of
[29:59] place out there in the world right and
[30:02] you just don't you can't fit in you
[30:07] don't if you don't feel out of place in
[30:09] the world and you didn't get your heart
[30:10] circumcised that offers you everybody
[30:12] right praise God
[30:19] so what is circumcision in our
[30:21] circumcision of the heart means the Holy
[30:23] Spirit going in and doing a work in the
[30:25] heart of man cutting off excess flesh
[30:28] yeah right none of you God doesn't want
[30:34] God doesn't he does want you but he
[30:39] doesn't want you to be living so much
[30:41] that he's not living with him right and
[30:47] in circumcision of the heart has nothing
[30:49] to do with the flesh and yet it does
[30:51] because again how I said the earlier the
[30:54] work starts from the inside out
[30:56] don't stop smoking your cigarettes
[30:59] before you come to Christ you'll never
[31:00] stop smoking cigarettes don't stop
[31:03] drinking alcohol before you before you
[31:05] say off before I come to Christ I need
[31:07] to stop drinking I gotta finish drinking
[31:09] my twelve case of beer and in the fridge
[31:12] before I come to church you know or come
[31:14] to crack know just do what just come to
[31:17] Christ all right I you know and then
[31:21] when there's been a true repentance a
[31:23] true work of Christ has been working
[31:26] you know has taken place that 12-pack of
[31:29] beer will take care of itself
[31:30] you know this is like I said it I said
[31:34] you know and that I just speak from my
[31:36] experience you know because when I was
[31:40] younger and and the Lord was dealing
[31:42] with me this was still in the Baptist
[31:44] Church
[31:44] this was the naming and the message
[31:46] there is things when I came when I
[31:48] accepted the fact that I needed to
[31:50] accept the Lord Jesus as my Lord and
[31:51] Savior even in that God was already
[31:56] doing the work in my life right even in
[32:00] that there was things that were falling
[32:02] there were that I didn't want to do
[32:03] anymore you know that I didn't want to
[32:05] get involved in anymore and I had
[32:07] friends friends would tell me you know
[32:10] because I love video games
[32:13] I still like playing them but you know
[32:15] there was certain video games that I
[32:16] would play back then they weren't really
[32:19] appropriate for for a Christian to play
[32:21] and and I was wanting to get rid of
[32:25] these video games and I'll tell my
[32:26] friend here I told my friend that I was
[32:29] a game gamer with I said look I just
[32:31] threw away the games and he said why did
[32:33] you throw him away why don't you just
[32:35] give it to me
[32:36] I said no because it's like me taking
[32:40] this poison and giving this poison to
[32:41] you yes it was a passing the poison over
[32:45] and so that's not what I wanted to do
[32:47] you see but nobody had told me to do
[32:49] that nobody it was just something that
[32:52] others are there rose up there wait a
[32:54] second this isn't this isn't godly this
[32:56] isn't what a Christian does right this
[32:58] isn't gonna help me grow in Christ to
[33:01] obtain a closer walk with Christ he must
[33:04] have a change from within which will
[33:05] didn't manifest on the outside amen
[33:09] the circumcision is a type of the Holy
[33:11] Ghost and God gave to Abraham the
[33:13] circumcision son after he had accepted
[33:14] God and his promise and walked out into
[33:16] a strange country I will just skip this
[33:19] away free
[33:20] go last slide right here Deuteronomy 10
[33:24] again
[33:25] look at verse 16 it says circumcise
[33:29] therefore the foreskin of your heart and
[33:32] be no more stiff necked
[33:33] Jim the Lord talking about circumcision
[33:37] of the heart amen praise God so we'll
[33:40] just we'll just stop it right there
[33:42] we'll continue at another time
[33:45] [Music]
[34:09] I've never seen that
