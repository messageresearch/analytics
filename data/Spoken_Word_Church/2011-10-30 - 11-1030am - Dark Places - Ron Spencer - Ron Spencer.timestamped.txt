[12:59] in jesus christ's name amen amen
[13:02] amen you will turn with me to james
[13:04] chapter 1 this morning
[13:12] i trust you was blessed yesterday
[13:13] evening
[13:16] man i know when i got in bed last night
[13:18] i was wore out so
[13:21] if i could measure it by that i was i'm
[13:23] just gone
[13:24] so amen thank god for rest
[13:29] amen james chapter one and i would like
[13:32] to
[13:32] i would like to look at just for just a
[13:35] little while this morning
[13:36] brother sam asked me if i would give a
[13:39] portion of the testimony this morning so
[13:41] i'd like to just speak to you for just a
[13:43] bit and just kind of blend some of those
[13:45] things in
[13:48] james chapter 1 and verse 12 blessed is
[13:50] the man
[13:52] that endureth temptation for when he is
[13:55] tried he shall receive a crown of life
[13:58] which the lord hath promised to them
[13:59] that love him
[14:01] let no man say when he is tempted i am
[14:03] tempted of god
[14:05] for god cannot be tempted with evil
[14:07] neither tempteth he
[14:09] any man but every man when he is tempted
[14:12] when he is drawn away of his own lust
[14:13] and enticed
[14:14] then when lust is conceived it brings
[14:16] forth sin and sin when it is finished
[14:18] bringing forth death
[14:19] do not air my beloved brethren
[14:23] psalms chapter 37 this morning you can
[14:25] be seated
[14:28] and i'll read several scriptures here
[14:30] psalm chapter 37 and verse 34 wait on
[14:33] the lord
[14:34] and keep his way and he shall
[14:37] exalt thee to inherit the land when the
[14:40] wicked are cut off they
[14:42] thou shalt see it right and i have seen
[14:44] the wicked in great power and
[14:45] spreading himself like a green bay tree
[14:48] yet he passes away and lo
[14:50] he was not yea i sought him but he could
[14:54] not be
[14:54] could not be found mark the perfect man
[14:59] and behold the upright for the end of
[15:02] that man is peace now i like that part
[15:07] mark the perfect man who said brother
[15:09] and i'd like to meet that perfect man
[15:12] through the eyes of god he looks at you
[15:16] amen i you know
[15:19] it doesn't give us a license to sin or
[15:21] neither does it give us a license to
[15:23] just go make mistakes
[15:24] but through the eyes of god god
[15:27] doesn't see our mistakes
[15:33] i i heard a pentecostal man say one time
[15:36] they had great difficulty
[15:38] when brother brown would walk to the
[15:39] pulpit and say father forgive me for my
[15:42] sins
[15:45] a prophet he could see himself
[15:49] right like you can see yourself
[15:54] psalms chapter 119 verse 33 order my
[15:57] steps
[15:59] in thy word and let not any iniquity
[16:03] have dominion over me
[16:06] deliver me from the oppression
[16:09] of man so will i
[16:12] keep thy precepts
[16:16] the other man says and i know my
[16:18] redeemer liveth he says no matter how
[16:20] little you are
[16:21] how big you are are how important you
[16:24] are
[16:25] or how unimportant you are you're here
[16:28] to serve a purpose just as my
[16:32] just as my finger is here for a purpose
[16:34] my nail is on my finger for a purpose
[16:37] my eye and every part of our bodies is
[16:39] here to serve a purpose
[16:40] it was not prettier just to see what it
[16:43] would look like than when it was put
[16:44] here
[16:45] but it was put here to serve a purpose
[16:47] and it's
[16:48] god's divine plan to do so and if we
[16:52] were here for a purpose then there is
[16:54] nothing
[16:55] that can destroy us until god's purpose
[16:59] is fulfilled amen are you with me
[17:03] nothing nothing can harm us until that
[17:07] purpose
[17:08] that god has put us here for has been
[17:11] made manifest
[17:14] no matter how much trouble that we
[17:17] have how much heartaches or sorrows that
[17:20] we go through
[17:22] all of these things are reason and there
[17:25] is a reason for it right
[17:26] amen that's exactly right sometimes when
[17:29] we become a christian we think well
[17:30] we've got it made now but brother says
[17:33] we're we just
[17:34] entered into the war we
[17:37] now becomes the molding process now the
[17:40] pressure
[17:41] right and oh i want the i want the
[17:43] character of god we'll
[17:55] you see god knows god knows what you
[17:58] what he has
[17:58] for you in his mind and coming through
[18:02] the the nature of humanity mourning sin
[18:05] chafing and
[18:05] iniquity he knows how you'll be born
[18:09] and so many times we say well you know i
[18:11] wish i was different well god knows
[18:12] exactly how you could be
[18:15] and he knew what your weaknesses were
[18:17] before you ever got here
[18:20] and he knew that it was going to take a
[18:22] process
[18:23] through to develop you right now don't
[18:26] you love the lord and through that
[18:28] process
[18:29] he's going to watch over here
[18:32] aren't you glad of that decision all
[18:33] right notice what brother said
[18:35] what god has imagined in his mind what
[18:38] god has purposed in his heart
[18:41] to bring the past there is no demon
[18:44] there is no power there is nothing can
[18:48] ever separate
[18:49] us from god's immortal
[18:52] eternal plan it must be
[18:56] as god has said right
[18:59] he said we find out that all of the
[19:01] world was going to be destroyed by a
[19:03] flood then what god
[19:04] what but but but by a flood that god had
[19:08] made a preparation
[19:09] a preparation for what caused to
[19:11] preserve
[19:12] his purpose he did it in the days of
[19:15] noah he's going to do it today
[19:17] he has made a preparation to conserve
[19:20] his
[19:20] own purpose he said he will conserve a
[19:23] church
[19:24] he will conserve a people he will
[19:26] conserve subjects
[19:28] for his great domain that death cannot
[19:30] destroy
[19:32] that's right are you with me now yes sir
[19:34] and he says a point once wrote
[19:36] oh what foretaste of glory divine heir
[19:39] of salvation purchase of god
[19:41] born of his spirit worth of his blood
[19:43] what an assurance upon this solid rock
[19:46] the resurrection of our blessed lover
[19:49] the lord jesus
[19:50] nothing can
[19:56] listen what paul begins to say a man who
[19:59] wrote 14 books of the bible
[20:01] he says let no man thank me to be a fool
[20:04] if otherwise yet as a folk receive me
[20:07] that i may be
[20:08] boast myself a little that which i speak
[20:10] i speak it is
[20:11] it not after the lord but as it were
[20:14] foolishly
[20:15] in the confidence of boasting seeing
[20:17] that we have many glory after the flesh
[20:19] i also
[20:20] i glory also for ye suffer
[20:23] fools gladly seeing ye yourselves are
[20:26] wise
[20:26] for if you suffer if a man bring you
[20:28] into bondage if a man devour you
[20:30] if a man take you if a man exalt himself
[20:33] if a man smite you on the face
[20:35] i speak concerning reproach as though we
[20:37] have been weak
[20:38] how big wherever any
[20:42] is born i speak foolishly i'm bored also
[20:45] here
[20:46] are they hebrews so am i are they
[20:48] israelites so am i
[20:49] are they seed of abraham so am i are
[20:51] they ministers of christ i speak as a
[20:53] fool i am more
[20:54] and labor is more abundant in stripes
[20:56] above measure in prison more frequent
[20:58] than that's often right
[21:02] of the jews five times received by 40
[21:04] stripes save one
[21:05] that's more than just a few sentences
[21:07] exactly right
[21:10] my man can say that i've been there and
[21:12] done that got the t-shirt
[21:21] you know a lot of people say things and
[21:23] that they haven't went through nothing
[21:25] right
[21:26] i'm going to be i'm a christian i've got
[21:28] it
[21:36] i believe this and i believe this well
[21:38] let's just let life happen
[21:40] all right that's right
[21:46] enjoy the honeymoon five times i
[21:50] received stripes saved one
[21:52] the rice i was beaten with rods once i
[21:54] was stoned thrice i suffered shipwreck a
[21:57] day and a night
[21:58] i have been in the deep in journeys
[22:00] often in perils of waters and perils of
[22:02] robbers and perils of my own countrymen
[22:04] and burials are they either
[22:05] in perils in the city and perils of the
[22:07] wilderness and perils of the sea
[22:08] imperials amongst false brethren
[22:10] probably that was the most dangerous
[22:12] right in weariness and painfulness and
[22:14] watchings often into hunger and thirst
[22:16] and
[22:17] fasting's often him cold and nakedness
[22:19] besides those things which are without
[22:21] that which cometh upon me daily the care
[22:23] of all the churches who is weak
[22:26] i am not weak who is offended i am not i
[22:28] burn up
[22:29] if i must need glory i will glory of the
[22:31] things which concern the mind
[22:33] infirmities
[22:34] right amen the god and father our lord
[22:36] jesus christ which is blessed
[22:37] forevermore
[22:38] he said north then i lied not notice how
[22:40] he says it right
[22:42] chapter 12 he said it is not expedient
[22:44] for me to doubtless to glory i will come
[22:46] to
[22:47] the visions and relations of the lord i
[22:49] knew a man in christ above 14 years ago
[22:51] whether in the body i cannot tell where
[22:53] they're out of the body i cannot tell
[22:54] god knoweth
[22:55] set your one carpet into the third
[22:57] heaven and i knew
[22:58] such a man whether in the body or out of
[23:00] the body i cannot tell going north
[23:02] how that he was caught up into the
[23:04] paradise and heard unspeakable words
[23:07] which is not lawful for a man to utter a
[23:09] such a one will i glory yet
[23:11] of myself i will not glory but in my
[23:14] infirmities though
[23:16] for though i would desire to glory i
[23:18] shall not be a fool
[23:19] for i will say the truth but now i
[23:21] forbear lester any man should think
[23:23] about me
[23:24] above that which is sent to me to me or
[23:26] heareth me
[23:27] and lest i should get exalted above
[23:29] through a measure through the abundance
[23:32] of revelations
[23:33] there was to give it to me a thorn in
[23:37] a thorn in the flesh the messenger of
[23:39] satan to buffet me lest i should get
[23:41] exalted above measure
[23:43] for this thing i've assaulted the lord
[23:45] thrice that it might depart from me
[23:48] and he said unto me my grace is
[23:51] sufficient for me
[23:52] for my strength is made perfect in
[23:55] weakness
[23:58] amen most gladly therefore i would
[24:00] rather glory in my infirmities that the
[24:02] power of christ might resurrect
[24:04] my may rest upon me therefore i take
[24:07] pleasure in infirmities
[24:08] i don't mean we're happy with it that's
[24:10] right yeah
[24:12] we're not careful we'll we'll allow our
[24:15] infirmities to be in a spot to where we
[24:17] almost worship them right
[24:19] that's right but god is greater than any
[24:21] infirmity that we will ever have
[24:25] the scripture says in second timothy
[24:27] chapter one
[24:28] he said god has not given us the spirit
[24:30] of fear
[24:32] but of power right and of love amen
[24:35] out of a sound which is a disciplined
[24:39] mind right right be not therefore
[24:42] ashamed of the testimony of our lord
[24:46] not of nor of me his prisoner
[24:49] but be thou partaker of the afflictions
[24:51] of the gospel according to the power of
[24:53] god
[24:54] brother man says and when he swore by
[24:56] himself he said these signs shall follow
[24:58] them that believe in my name
[25:00] they shall cast out devils and speak
[25:02] with new tongues
[25:04] they'll take up serpents or drink any
[25:05] deadly thing we know it's pointing
[25:07] mark chapter 16 or lay hands on the sick
[25:10] and they shall recover
[25:14] jesus said that he said why he
[25:17] he's become part of him yes sir god's
[25:20] on on the instance to deliver
[25:24] anything he'll make a way and when
[25:26] there's no way
[25:27] he makes the way and if any man believes
[25:31] in him he believes the same thing he has
[25:33] to
[25:34] he's a part of god he's an offspring of
[25:36] god amen
[25:38] that's it are you with me amen over the
[25:41] line i'm afraid
[25:42] i'll miss the rapture listen that's
[25:44] that's impossible right
[25:45] right that's absolutely impossible if
[25:47] you
[25:48] are eternal as jesus christ is eternal
[25:52] and he's the token living on the inside
[25:54] of you and i'm not talking about
[25:55] something put on something
[25:57] it's impossible for you and i to
[25:59] misdirection
[26:02] because the rapture is on the inside of
[26:04] us right he said he said he said he's
[26:06] the offspring of god
[26:07] he's the son of god or a daughter of god
[26:10] and it can't do nothing else because
[26:12] god's right with him
[26:13] he's just a portion of god look
[26:15] everything that god was was in the
[26:17] pillar of fire
[26:18] he emptied himself into the son jesus
[26:20] christ and in him dwelt the fullness
[26:22] of the godhead body is that right the
[26:25] bible said that
[26:26] god g.o.d himself jehovah the mighty one
[26:29] the buckler the shield the redemptive
[26:31] thing
[26:31] everything he was was emptied into jesus
[26:34] christ
[26:36] are you with me now now that's not the
[26:38] end of the story
[26:40] brotherhood uses an analogy he said all
[26:43] that was in god he poured it into christ
[26:45] and all that was in christ he poured it
[26:47] into the church
[26:49] a many member
[26:53] oh sure we see one another we know one
[26:55] of them another's mistakes
[26:58] that's right we know one another's
[27:01] failures if you've been around a little
[27:03] while you realize that
[27:04] none of us have any perfect churches
[27:08] but we know a perfect god amen
[27:11] hallelujah
[27:12] all right that's right oh don't you love
[27:14] the lord listen to david as
[27:16] david begins to address his own
[27:18] situations
[27:19] he said wash me from uniniquity right
[27:22] cleanse me from my sins
[27:24] for i acknowledge my transgressions and
[27:27] my sins
[27:27] forever before me all right and the only
[27:30] reason i would like to just drop this in
[27:32] this morning
[27:33] sometimes if we're not careful
[27:37] we we feel like that we can live a
[27:41] private life
[27:42] during the week at a church life
[27:48] and we think well brother i got this
[27:49] covered
[27:51] and the devil will will cause and i
[27:54] don't feel like there's probably anybody
[27:55] here tonight living a double life but
[27:58] but i just want to kill that devil
[27:59] anyway
[28:01] and so and so and so what will happen if
[28:04] if we're not careful we'll have only
[28:07] church entity
[28:08] and we'll allow ourselves we'll allow
[28:11] ourselves the flexibility i can do what
[28:14] i won't do on the job right
[28:16] or and then and then the devil will come
[28:18] along and he's the kind of an
[28:19] enemy that will talk you into robbing
[28:21] the bank and then he'll call the
[28:28] amen police he's kind of an enemy that
[28:32] that knows your weakness and because
[28:34] he's been working on your forefathers
[28:36] and you're working on your former
[28:38] and listen he knows what the blend of
[28:40] humanity that you've got inside of you
[28:43] listen computers didn't happen overnight
[28:45] listen he knows he's watched your
[28:47] bloodlines as you come down
[28:49] and listen your fathers and your mothers
[28:51] they gave you all their weaknesses
[28:54] and it's those weaknesses that you have
[28:56] to overcome
[28:58] and that's the reason you need to do
[28:59] birth and the new birth
[29:01] cancels are you with me now cancels all
[29:04] of those strengths
[29:05] exactly and that sin nature is killed
[29:08] because god don't dwell
[29:10] he don't dwell in an unclean vessel and
[29:12] god don't negotiate with the enemy i'll
[29:14] give you your corner
[29:16] if you just stay over there that enemy's
[29:18] got to be killed
[29:20] and listen the pastor can preach but
[29:22] you've got to deal you've got to deal
[29:24] with your weakness
[29:29] this is not a negotiation session well
[29:31] well you know
[29:32] you know well i brother ronnie if you
[29:34] only knew that i had a filthy my god
[29:36] knows you don't have to tell me
[29:40] god already knows but if you be honest
[29:42] with god
[29:43] you be honest with god and you deal with
[29:46] that issue
[29:47] when it comes up because he is going to
[29:50] put you in the melting pot
[29:52] he's going to send you through some
[29:54] trials to get that out of you
[29:58] hallelujah he's going to allow people to
[30:01] talk about
[30:02] you to mold you amen
[30:06] this isn't going to the library and
[30:08] saying i i would like some patience here
[30:12] right right this isn't well i i'm going
[30:15] to figure out what love is all about and
[30:17] that's
[30:17] that's the way i'm going to live no when
[30:19] he comes on the inside of you
[30:21] right right glory he has every attribute
[30:24] of himself and if he get are you with me
[30:26] now
[30:27] and he begins to live all right glory
[30:29] amen all the answers
[30:31] we have around all of our problems is
[30:32] more of him
[30:35] that's right but the bible says that he
[30:36] said i'm thankful for a church universal
[30:39] triumphant right he said already
[30:42] predestinated
[30:44] and called and sealed
[30:47] to that body listen as paul says and we
[30:50] know that all things work together
[30:52] right for the good to them that love god
[30:54] to them who are
[30:55] be called according to his purpose
[30:57] notice it's be called according to his
[30:59] purpose
[31:00] he said for whom he did for no he also
[31:02] did predestinate to be conformed
[31:04] to the image of his son that he might be
[31:06] the firstborn among many brethren
[31:08] moreover whom he did predestinate than
[31:10] he also called
[31:11] and whom he called oh watch me watch
[31:14] this forgive me he said
[31:15] and whom he called he also justified and
[31:18] whom he justified then he also glorified
[31:20] amen all right oh hallelujah
[31:24] i love it when justification is when we
[31:27] get the revelation of that it's as
[31:28] though we never did it in the first
[31:30] place
[31:30] all right
[31:35] listen listen when the blood of jesus
[31:37] christ takes care of it
[31:38] it's as though you never did it in the
[31:40] first place
[31:44] and you tell the enemy that comes back
[31:46] to bombard your
[31:48] mind and remind you of your failures and
[31:51] your mistakes
[31:52] and as you're going along the way and
[31:54] you're you're having your ups and downs
[31:55] and your roller coaster experience come
[31:57] to a spot in your life say
[31:59] i'm not going there no more all right
[32:01] man that's exactly right
[32:02] all right exactly right that's it
[32:07] i told this at home there's a friend of
[32:10] mine called me
[32:13] he was a friend of my former life
[32:16] and he called me and he said hey i'd
[32:18] like to spend a little time with you
[32:19] today i'm in your area i'd like to spend
[32:21] a little time with you
[32:23] and so i was actually buying myself a
[32:25] car
[32:27] and so i said well i i said i've got
[32:30] kind of a busy day going i said but i'd
[32:31] love to see you
[32:33] we're actually purchasing a car and
[32:36] i will be at such a short place if you'd
[32:38] like to have dinner together today and
[32:40] so
[32:41] so i i told my boys i said now this
[32:43] fella
[32:45] he knows my former life
[32:48] he don't know this guy right yeah
[32:52] you don't know this guy you don't know
[32:55] that guy
[33:00] and so we met him we met him for for
[33:03] dinner and
[33:04] you know we we did our cordial greetings
[33:06] and all of this kind of thing and so
[33:08] his name was andy and i said as we begin
[33:11] to talk a little bit you know
[33:13] immediately
[33:14] he began to make links to a man that
[33:16] used to live here
[33:17] right yeah yeah and as he began to make
[33:20] links my boys didn't know that fella
[33:24] and as he began to go down through
[33:25] pikmin alley and
[33:27] yeah you know remember when yeah yeah
[33:30] and maybe
[33:31] those were war stories that we used to
[33:33] enjoy rehearsing
[33:34] yeah after a weekend or after a week and
[33:38] we would enjoy those war stories and i
[33:40] just kind of set kind of mom ashamed
[33:43] that they were even being brought up and
[33:45] he kind of noticed that you know it
[33:47] didn't have the same resounding effect
[33:49] anymore
[33:50] yeah right then he began to kind of
[33:52] quickly kind of you know as much as he
[33:54] had tried to dig the hole he was not
[33:55] trying to cover it up and so
[33:57] we did i was just sitting and we were we
[33:59] were having our dinner and
[34:01] i said uh eddie uh because i i didn't
[34:04] want him to feel so uncomfortable and
[34:06] i just allowed him to go for a little
[34:07] while
[34:09] and i said eddie uh i i guess i need to
[34:11] talk to you a little bit
[34:14] the fella that you know
[34:17] is dead right
[34:26] so i began to talk to him about the new
[34:28] birth right
[34:30] how that i repented and repented it's
[34:33] more than shaking a preacher's hand and
[34:35] it's more than just
[34:37] saying that now i'm going to go to
[34:39] church
[34:40] and it's turning from your ways
[34:44] and having an emptying out of that fella
[34:46] because
[34:47] that fella he's got to die right yeah
[34:50] there's a real sanctification process
[34:52] and there's some
[34:53] so some i sorry's and and some
[34:56] restorations that's got to take place
[34:59] and there's some real bulldozer down
[35:02] through the tin can alley that's got to
[35:04] take place and
[35:05] some real washing by the word
[35:08] and a real process of that right but
[35:10] listen that don't all just you don't
[35:12] stay in that face
[35:14] and go backwards and forwards but
[35:16] there's going to be a real
[35:17] burp that happens a real supernatural
[35:22] birth that happens in your life that you
[35:25] know that he lives right
[35:28] that's right and the author of the book
[35:30] comes and lives on the
[35:32] inside of you and now you become a
[35:35] living witnessing
[35:36] right and i begin to i begin to just
[35:38] talk to him
[35:40] and i begin to talk to him about that
[35:42] man he's dead
[35:44] yeah right right this looks like an
[35:46] image of the same house
[35:49] but the man that used to live here don't
[35:51] live here anymore
[35:53] that's right yeah and then i did
[35:58] begin to present it to him right
[36:04] i presented the scripture romans chapter
[36:07] 8.
[36:08] there is now therefore now no
[36:11] condemnation
[36:13] to them that are in christ jesus who
[36:15] walk not after the flesh
[36:18] but after the spirit that's right now
[36:20] that man
[36:22] is gone
[36:26] now i told you that story because the
[36:29] enemy
[36:30] that inspired that man to come and
[36:31] witness to talk to me about my past
[36:35] comes to you every day right yeah
[36:38] right not in the form of an old friend
[36:41] right
[36:42] but he'll come in your memory channel
[36:44] right here
[36:46] right and he'll take you down 10k
[36:49] and he'll take you through this image
[36:51] and that image and that image
[36:54] but never allow it just to come through
[36:56] to contaminate your life
[36:59] but remind him over and over again
[37:03] it's done right all right
[37:06] exactly and there is no weapon that is
[37:08] formed against them
[37:10] shall prosper
[37:13] the squatter of the enemy cannot have
[37:16] you slave
[37:17] anymore the pardon has been signed
[37:23] it is taken care of right amen amen
[37:26] are you with me now amen he's already
[37:29] justified you
[37:30] and if he's already justified you watch
[37:32] notice what he says
[37:33] then he's also glorified what shall we
[37:35] say then those things
[37:36] if god before us who can be against us
[37:42] he that spared not his own son but
[37:43] delivered him up for us
[37:45] all how shall he not with him also
[37:46] freely give us all things
[37:48] who shall anything to the charge of
[37:50] god's elect it is god that justifies it
[37:52] amen who is he that condemneth it is
[37:55] christ that died yeah
[37:56] rather that is risen again who is even
[37:58] at the right hand of god
[37:59] who make up intercession for us who
[38:02] shall separate
[38:03] us from the love of christ shall
[38:05] tribulation
[38:06] or distress or persecution or famine or
[38:09] nakedness or pearl of sword
[38:10] as it is written for thy sake we're
[38:12] killed all the day long
[38:14] and we're accounted as sheep for a
[38:15] slaughter may and all these things we
[38:17] are more than conquerors
[38:20] more than conquerors through him that
[38:21] love us for i am persuaded that neither
[38:23] death nor life nor angels or prince of
[38:25] powers or powers
[38:26] or things present or things to come nor
[38:29] height nor death or any other creature
[38:31] shall be able to separate us
[38:32] from the love of god which is in christ
[38:34] jesus our lord amen
[38:36] this is the same man that said i was
[38:38] beaten by the jews
[38:40] this is the same man that said i have a
[38:42] shipwreck
[38:44] but here he comes back and he begins to
[38:46] say all things
[38:47] work together amen all right
[38:51] amen all right this is just part of the
[38:53] molding process
[38:55] all right listen to psalms chapter 91 he
[38:57] that dwelleth in the secret place of the
[38:59] most high

[39:02] almighty and i will say of the lord he
[39:04] is my refuge in my fortress
[39:07] my god in him will i trust surely he
[39:09] shall deliver thee from the snare of the
[39:11] fowler
[39:12] and from the noiseless pestilence he
[39:14] shall cover thee with his feathers and
[39:16] under his wings shall thou trust
[39:17] his truth shall be thy shield and
[39:19] buckler be thou
[39:21] be thou shalt not be afraid for the
[39:23] terror by night nor the arrow that flies
[39:25] by day
[39:25] nor the pestilence that walketh in
[39:27] darkness nor the destruction that waste
[39:29] at that noon day
[39:30] a thousand shall fall at thy side ten
[39:32] thousand at thy right hand
[39:34] but it shall not come nigh thee all
[39:36] right these are powerful scriptures
[39:38] amen amen brother i mean somebody it's
[39:40] for you amen
[39:43] when jim gardner brother brown talks
[39:45] about that in the book of judges
[39:48] shamgar was was standing there and
[39:50] remembered
[39:51] that he was a seed of abraham
[39:54] and when he remembered who he was the
[39:56] philistines that destroyed him every
[39:59] year
[40:00] when he remembered who he was
[40:03] he grabbed a six-foot stick
[40:08] and it is recorded that he killed 600
[40:11] men
[40:13] not with one wave one at a time
[40:18] that's right i've said it many times
[40:21] the devil doesn't read god's word as
[40:23] well as he thinks he does
[40:26] if he did he would have brought more
[40:28] than a thousand men
[40:29] that's right yeah right
[40:33] brother how do i have why do i have so
[40:35] much trouble
[40:37] well he knows that if he don't bring a
[40:39] thousand a thousand demons

[41:02] refuge even my
[41:04] most high thy habitation there shall no
[41:06] evil befall them amen
[41:09] neither shall any plague come nigh thy
[41:10] dwelling for he
[41:12] shall give his angels charge over thee
[41:14] to keep thee in all thy ways
[41:16] and they shall bear thee up in their
[41:18] hands lest thou dash thy foot against
[41:20] the stone
[41:21] thou shalt tread upon the lion and the
[41:23] outer the young men and the dragon shall
[41:25] thou trample under faith
[41:26] because he has set his love upon thee
[41:29] therefore will i deliver him i will set
[41:31] him on high because he have known my
[41:33] name
[41:35] hallelujah he has no mind message amen
[41:42] he shall call upon me and i will answer
[41:45] him yes sir
[41:46] i won't be with him in trouble i will
[41:48] deliver him and honor him
[41:50] with long life will i satisfy him right
[41:53] and show him my salvation amen
[41:56] that's a wonderful scripture brother
[41:57] ryan let me give you a little background
[42:00] about that scripture
[42:02] it was a man in britain he was in the
[42:04] british army
[42:06] he was a colonel and he told all of his
[42:08] men under him he said
[42:10] i want every one of you
[42:14] every soldier that is in your battalion
[42:17] i want you to read that scripture before
[42:20] you go to battle
[42:22] he told the officers he said do not let
[42:24] a man go to battle
[42:25] without reading a scripture and i want
[42:28] you to read it every day
[42:29] i wanted to cross your lips every day
[42:32] he fought four years in world war one
[42:37] and not one man was shot
[42:46] the battalion that fought right next to
[42:48] him lost 88
[42:49] in one bottom not one man was shot
[42:54] this is a man that doesn't know anything
[42:56] about malachi 4-5-6
[42:58] this is a man that doesn't know anything
[43:00] about revelations 10
[43:02] 7. doesn't know anything about
[43:04] revelations 19 but this is a man that
[43:06] took god at his word
[43:09] this is a covenant between god and man
[43:12] right and he took
[43:13] god at his covenant heavens and earth
[43:17] will pass away
[43:18] but his word will not pass away all
[43:20] right
[43:21] that's right amen yes sir exactly
[43:24] brother
[43:24] said in one instance and i'm not going
[43:26] to i'm not a quarter quarter exactly but
[43:28] brother brown says he said the devil was
[43:30] so big
[43:31] and he said just something unction on
[43:33] the inside of him to say move
[43:34] yeah and he said the more that i said
[43:37] move
[43:37] the smaller the devil all right
[43:42] brother dan diesel used to tell a story
[43:44] and you no doubt heard it over and over
[43:45] again
[43:47] about this mouse that was being chased
[43:50] by this cat
[43:51] yeah and as this mouse was being chased
[43:53] by this catch you know he
[43:54] found himself in a wine
[43:58] and could her girl go and he came back
[44:00] up and finally got out of the wine
[44:01] bottle
[44:04] and he said where's that cat
[44:17] if you ever realize who you are all
[44:19] right
[44:20] if you ever realize who you are right a
[44:23] little woman that don't hardly weigh 100
[44:24] pounds soaking wet
[44:25] all right can go on their knees and
[44:27] shake the kingdom off
[44:30] young people that are alone in their
[44:32] school let me just say
[44:33] god does not have to fortify you with
[44:35] ten thousand believers around you
[44:38] that's right he doesn't have to crush
[44:40] you up and prop you up
[44:41] and beg you up and hamper you up and
[44:43] baby you around
[44:44] a real child of god right god can allow
[44:48] them to go through some tasks right and
[44:50] god's got confidence in them
[44:53] that they can go through their trials
[44:59] brother ron if i went through that trial
[45:00] i know i'd make it to uh you might want
[45:02] to hang on to that one
[45:07] god knows what he wants out of your life
[45:08] that's right he knows what it takes to
[45:10] get you where you need to go
[45:11] right right that's right sometimes we
[45:14] look at a man or we look at a woman
[45:15] that's sitting beside
[45:16] us in church and we go wow what a
[45:18] christian you don't know what it took to
[45:20] get that person there
[45:23] you really don't know what it took
[45:26] sometimes we don't appreciate the value
[45:29] of the results of which god hates right
[45:32] right
[45:33] sometimes we just really don't
[45:34] appreciate the value because
[45:36] there are people that show up in church
[45:38] on sunday morning
[45:41] wednesday night and they've been through
[45:43] some extreme difficulties just to be
[45:45] there
[45:46] right now some of us went through cancer
[45:48] and cancer with its terrible fear that
[45:51] goes along with it
[45:52] but let me just say no matter how deep
[45:54] the cancer is
[45:56] god is not our god is not not not
[46:00] going to succumb to the god of cancer
[46:02] cancer is not bigger than our god
[46:06] that's right i stood at the motel this
[46:09] morning and i came down early for
[46:10] breakfast it was
[46:11] just before 7. and the ladies were
[46:15] working there kind of feverishly getting
[46:17] the
[46:17] breakfast together and taking care of
[46:19] what they needed to do and
[46:21] this lady asked me she said are you a
[46:23] preacher and i said yes yes ma'am i am
[46:26] you know almost sometimes you got to be
[46:28] careful even to say that you know
[46:30] i said yes ma'am i am i'm here preaching
[46:32] for brother samuel daley
[46:34] and i i said we're having services this
[46:36] morning at services last night
[46:39] and she said i have a friend her name is
[46:42] juanita
[46:43] and she just got the news this week that
[46:45] that she has cancer
[46:47] and she just went to bed and depressed
[46:49] and and she just just kind of threw life
[46:51] away i said
[46:52] well i want you i want you to tell her
[46:54] that the cancer is not greater than god
[46:58] i want you to remind her that cancer is
[47:00] not greater than god
[47:01] cancer is a demon spirit and brother i
[47:04] said
[47:05] we don't fear cancer we don't fear
[47:08] cancer
[47:09] that the enemy would try to come along
[47:11] and make us miss us come to the level to
[47:14] wherever that we would fear when it when
[47:15] it just the doctor says it could cross
[47:17] its lips
[47:18] brother man said he said when the doctor
[47:20] tells you that you've got a disease
[47:22] he said you walk with god all right
[47:25] the scripture said whose report do we
[47:26] believe all right
[47:28] right whose report do we believe i
[47:31] choose to believe god's report amen
[47:33] god said i am your healer i am right
[47:39] four years ago when i was i had
[47:42] i had came home i'd spent the day with
[47:44] brother holy brother lloyd walls and
[47:46] some others and i don't know for sure
[47:49] exactly who who all i spent the day with
[47:51] but i spent the day with them and we've
[47:53] been at a car auction and on the on the
[47:56] on the way home you know i we had a man
[47:59] that had passed away in our church and i
[48:01] went to the wake of that evening
[48:03] as i as they came home it was we've been
[48:05] in a drought situation and
[48:07] we had some things to burn and so so i
[48:10] had a propane tank and it was kind of
[48:12] our
[48:12] i grew up in uh at home burning
[48:16] burning brush and burning fence froze
[48:17] and things like that with the propane
[48:20] tank and i was so used to it but on this
[48:21] particular evening i was using this unit
[48:24] i couldn't get it to light matthew
[48:26] showed up just just at the nick of time
[48:27] god knows
[48:28] god knows all things whitney needed
[48:31] grant paper and so
[48:32] her need for graph paper had matthew
[48:35] there right
[48:36] of all people that would have paid for
[48:38] matthew had graph paper
[48:40] and so matthew came and he saw me
[48:43] working with a flashlight and so he
[48:44] immediately come up and
[48:45] dad what you doing i said get ready to
[48:47] light this on fire and he said
[48:49] you know what you're doing i said we've
[48:50] done it hundreds of times and so we're
[48:52] standing there trying to get into light
[48:53] and unbeknownst to me that
[48:55] the gases had come out and they they
[48:57] were spread all over the place
[48:58] and so finally we got it to ignite and
[49:01] when it when it ignited
[49:02] it ignited all of that all right and so
[49:05] when it ignited i i don't remember these
[49:08] things
[49:09] thank god for that but matthew grabbed
[49:11] me and pulled me away
[49:12] with such force until it jerked his
[49:15] shoulder
[49:16] out of place and so long and short they
[49:19] took me to the
[49:20] the rescue and and the rescue began to
[49:22] work on me and
[49:24] and then then i would go into a cold
[49:26] blue situation there
[49:28] in the rescue unit and they actually had
[49:31] prayer for us in the rescue unit
[49:34] and they they knew who i was and then
[49:37] and then when we got to the the hospital
[49:39] was a man named dr kramer
[49:41] that was actually there dr kramer i i
[49:43] had known him through the past
[49:45] he was the man that worked on brother
[49:47] homer brother homer had fell out of a
[49:49] tree stand about 20 some feet
[49:51] and fell out of the tree stand and did a
[49:52] somersault and he had crushed his pelvis
[49:56] and dr kramer was the man to get him to
[49:59] get him to be flown to uva
[50:03] you know it's not safe to be around some
[50:05] of us guys
[50:08] that's right but that's a story within
[50:11] itself
[50:12] and bro homer had fell out of a couple's
[50:14] tree stands he finally got the
[50:15] revelation
[50:25] we were talking one day matthew and
[50:26] myself were talking going down the road
[50:28] and he said you know
[50:29] you know the bible says we've got angels
[50:31] watching over us
[50:32] he said i'm sure there was a
[50:33] conversation going on do we bring them
[50:35] to heaven
[50:37] or lord would you just leave them there
[50:39] to see what else they didn't do
[50:45] that's right and so when this goes off
[50:48] dr kramer
[50:49] i i go into a room they they termed it
[50:51] room 14
[50:53] when i when i went into this room they
[50:54] took me into this room i didn't know
[50:56] what was going on
[50:57] sent me into this room and they cut my
[50:59] wedding band off and
[51:01] because my hands were swelling so
[51:03] quickly and when the doctor
[51:04] looked into my lungs he told me that all
[51:06] i could see was soot
[51:08] he said and i felt in my heart no way
[51:11] could i ever save this man
[51:15] he said we put you on life support i
[51:17] actually met him at an airport
[51:19] uh just only a few months ago and and he
[51:22] told me he said
[51:24] we were going through the security line
[51:25] together
[51:27] and he said there was no way that i ever
[51:28] thought you'd live yeah
[51:31] and so i began to testify to him
[51:35] he said you know your lungs were 75
[51:37] burned
[51:40] you know it's one thing for your skin to
[51:41] be burned right but the inside of my
[51:43] mouth the tongue
[51:44] the top of my mouth my lips my face my
[51:47] hands
[51:48] my arms were reconstructed and so
[51:52] my lungs were burned and i would get vre
[51:54] pneumonia
[51:55] on top of all of that and you begin to
[51:58] pray
[51:59] and i believe that is why it's so
[52:01] important that we pray one for another
[52:03] american
[52:03] american for the effectual prayer of a
[52:06] righteous man of development
[52:08] oh we come to the message and you know
[52:10] we we
[52:11] we get the intellect of the message and
[52:14] we've got our books and we've got our
[52:15] computer and we've got our internet
[52:17] we've got all that
[52:18] but god's not going to rapture those
[52:19] things
[52:21] right amen he's going to rapture human
[52:24] vessels
[52:26] human vessels that are the final voice
[52:29] to the final age and when we talk about
[52:32] what brother ben uses a term if given
[52:34] time they'd write a book of acts behind
[52:36] it that's right
[52:38] i'm sure in this building there are
[52:40] phenomenal testimonies
[52:44] phenomenal testimonies of the children
[52:47] of god that has went through
[52:49] devastating situations devastating
[52:53] horrible things that you've went through
[52:56] but god has allowed you
[52:58] as a testimony he's allowed you as a
[53:02] testimony
[53:02] to overcome right all right notice when
[53:05] it says
[53:05] to in revelations 3 to him that
[53:08] overcometh
[53:09] right and we're quick to say i want to
[53:12] be an overcomer
[53:13] but to to be allowed to
[53:16] live through some real trials and some
[53:19] real temptations
[53:20] right right nobody nobody prays to be
[53:24] burned up
[53:26] right exactly and i'm really thrilled to
[53:28] be on
[53:29] this end of the fire all right amen
[53:34] i was with brother tim the other day he
[53:36] was at my home
[53:38] i said brother tim through that window i
[53:40] said in a wheelchair
[53:42] and he said these roses are beautiful
[53:43] brother ron i said through that window i
[53:45] sit
[53:45] in a wheelchair with my hands bandaged
[53:49] up
[53:51] sister connie would after i came home
[53:53] sister connie would
[53:54] spend two hours every morning first of
[53:56] all i took four
[53:57] oxycontins
[54:01] for morning so i could just stand the
[54:03] pain
[54:05] so i wouldn't send my body into shock
[54:07] and she would scrape my skin
[54:09] thank god for a good wife
[54:14] you know sometimes young people when you
[54:16] stand at the altar
[54:17] you're standing there in that beautiful
[54:19] dress or that tuxedo or
[54:21] however however you're sitting in a taxi
[54:24] cab somewhere another didn't marry
[54:29] and believe it or not i have a preacher
[54:30] friend that was sitting there
[54:44] you know sometimes we say for better for
[54:46] worse right
[54:47] we don't know what we just said right we
[54:50] really don't know what we just said
[54:52] right because life is real
[54:55] right god is real life is real right
[54:58] you know we're looking at one another
[55:00] and we're all right we may have a good
[55:02] job or we may have good education
[55:04] and we begin to begin to go out and
[55:06] start life and a lot of times we want to
[55:08] be at the top of the tree
[55:10] we want to be at the top of the level
[55:12] and have everything our parents have but
[55:13] there's a process you got to go through
[55:17] you know you know there's a process of
[55:19] peanut butter and jelly process
[55:21] i don't have everything my parents said
[55:23] i i like that suit material where i like
[55:25] to have one of them why you don't know
[55:26] what it took to get that suit
[55:30] sometimes we think that everything's
[55:31] just magic it ain't magic
[55:34] sometimes there's some real difficult
[55:35] hours where you're praying
[55:37] god help me just to get fueled just i
[55:40] can get to work
[55:47] i never forget when i was a boy we were
[55:49] just married
[55:52] i don't have all this fixed in front of
[55:54] me so i'm just gonna
[55:57] i'll never forget we were
[56:00] i worked at an arsenal where i made
[56:03] nitroglycerin
[56:05] we think about that now
[56:11] god has a sense of humor
[56:25] my grandmother got saved the same night
[56:27] that i did
[56:28] she gave her heart with the lord she was
[56:30] a tough old girl
[56:32] real girl she was a tough old girl
[56:37] i didn't have fuel money to get to work
[56:41] and so i asked her because i i'm the
[56:43] kind of fella i don't i don't
[56:44] i don't i don't i've never asked anybody
[56:46] for anything come on brother
[56:49] so it took great humility
[56:52] to say hey do you have five dollars to
[56:55] where i can get to work
[56:59] and it was during a season to wear that
[57:02] she had no cash whatsoever on her
[57:05] none
[57:08] and i noticed the incredible shame in
[57:10] her face i'd like to be able to help you
[57:16] she went on her knees and she said god i
[57:20] i have need
[57:23] and she went into her pocketbook an
[57:26] old pocketbook that she had cleaned out
[57:29] and there was twenty dollar bill laying
[57:31] in there
[57:38] you know sometimes we take those those
[57:39] things and we allow them to just slip by
[57:42] yeah but they were incredible right
[57:45] not sure in that moment
[57:48] god just didn't say abraham take thy
[57:50] child there were many trials that he
[57:52] went through in his perfecting process
[57:55] to get him to work
[57:57] he could handle that drive right
[58:00] right god has allowed me
[58:04] to go through trials and i'm glad i'm
[58:06] patched
[58:09] falling off of the house 40 feet and
[58:11] landing on concrete
[58:13] and the doctor looking at me and said
[58:15] you'll never walk again
[58:17] was a difficult a difficult process
[58:22] right yeah but now no matter the
[58:24] situation
[58:26] i can look at a young man i can look at
[58:29] a young man sitting in a wheelchair
[58:31] and say god it's greater than
[58:41] i i shared this with brother sam
[58:44] yesterday
[58:46] i went hunting in edmonton and there was
[58:48] a young man that kind of guided me
[58:50] through my trip there

[59:05] from his spinal cord
[59:07] and all he could move was his eyes it

[1:01:03] brother harold's there he sat in a fully
[1:01:06] functional wheelchair
[1:01:08] moving him about the next year when i
[1:01:12] went back he was on a walker and he was
[1:01:14] struggling about it

[1:01:18] after that i was there and he
[1:01:19] he was he had braces on his legs and on
[1:01:22] his arms and he was functioning around
[1:01:24] him

[1:01:53] trusting the arm of flesh
[1:01:55] right listen there are times that you'll
[1:01:57] never hear our voices
[1:01:58] as ministers but god's still in control
[1:02:02] of the entire situation right right
[1:02:04] there's no piano to be heard
[1:02:06] there's no drums to be played in your
[1:02:08] ears
[1:02:10] hallelujah and all the emotion of the
[1:02:13] meeting is
[1:02:14] gone right now he's still there all
[1:02:16] right
[1:02:31] when i was sitting in that wheelchair
[1:02:33] looking at those roses
[1:02:36] an enemy would tell me you'll never
[1:02:37] preach again
[1:02:40] lungs burn that bad it was hard to just
[1:02:43] get out of bed
[1:02:45] yeah and go about daily walk
[1:02:48] right it was difficult to stand in the
[1:02:50] pulpit to just
[1:02:52] try to speak and i i i would
[1:02:55] progressively get better
[1:03:02] biscuit called sister connie
[1:03:05] and it was very early in the morning
[1:03:07] when he called sister connie
[1:03:11] and began to talk to her and he told her
[1:03:15] we've
[1:03:15] we have purchased mount baker bible way
[1:03:18] camp
[1:03:20] and he said god has laid on my heart
[1:03:23] we've heard about the accident we're
[1:03:25] praying for you
[1:03:29] and i want to share you this with you
[1:03:32] god has laid on my heart
[1:03:34] that brother ron will be the speaker
[1:03:36] next year
[1:03:38] in our convention amen
[1:03:41] what brother ed didn't know on the other
[1:03:43] end of the line as
[1:03:45] is that i had a vre pneumonia
[1:03:48] and that very night the doctor had
[1:03:50] actually came in and prayed with me
[1:03:54] saying that he had done all that he
[1:03:55] could do and now it was in the hands of
[1:03:58] god
[1:03:59] he had pronounced this to my wife
[1:04:03] there's very little hope the machine is
[1:04:05] on 100
[1:04:07] and that very day a hollywood movie star
[1:04:12] had aspirated from the same
[1:04:15] from a condition of his stomach and it
[1:04:18] went into his lungs and burned his lungs
[1:04:21] and that night i aspirated on those
[1:04:24] burned lungs already 75 percent
[1:04:28] burn and now stomach fluid is poured in
[1:04:30] on them
[1:04:34] but there's nothing impossible to do
[1:04:38] exactly that's right and sister connie
[1:04:40] seeing what she was saying
[1:04:42] remembered those words a man of god
[1:04:45] has just called me right sure and said
[1:04:48] brother on
[1:04:49] we'll be speaking in the convention next
[1:04:52] year
[1:04:55] it wasn't what she was looking at it was
[1:04:58] what god was looking at
[1:05:01] god doesn't twist his hands and you know
[1:05:04] god never has a crisis meeting
[1:05:08] are you with me it's never out of
[1:05:10] control in your life
[1:05:12] when your world is spinning and you feel
[1:05:14] like you're in the middle of a tornado

[1:05:32] and

[1:07:32] her
[1:07:36] it's a very difficult hour
[1:07:41] there was a state of being no brainwave
[1:07:44] activity after i woke up
[1:07:46] right 36 hours
[1:07:51] the general rule of consensus is four or
[1:07:53] five and ours they begin to talk about
[1:07:56] organ donation the nurse told me said
[1:07:59] you're very fortunate young man you
[1:08:01] you woke up said
[1:08:04] i'm sure that there was they were they
[1:08:06] were dealing with organ donations
[1:08:09] and you you had signed your card to be
[1:08:12] an organ donor
[1:08:13] i got my card changed
[1:08:36] you you look back and you say well
[1:08:38] brother ron why
[1:08:40] it's not for me to ask god that's
[1:08:41] exactly exactly right
[1:08:44] it's not my my situation to ask why
[1:08:47] exactly
[1:08:48] it's just for thank god that you were
[1:08:51] with me lord
[1:08:53] that's right
[1:09:00] the bible says tells us in the scripture
[1:09:03] hundreds of times fear not
[1:09:08] but it's right in the midst of our
[1:09:10] obstacle of life that we
[1:09:11] fear will grip us
[1:09:15] right in the middle of our trouble we'll
[1:09:17] get all excited
[1:09:19] and try to do something about the
[1:09:21] situation that we're in
[1:09:22] in our humanity right but you
[1:09:25] must remember an enemy that comes to
[1:09:29] try you and tries to tempt you is trying
[1:09:32] to pull you into his realm to fight
[1:09:34] right right but we're the faces
[1:09:38] we're to operate in a completely
[1:09:40] different level right right
[1:09:42] a level of spoken word right and the
[1:09:45] bible says that
[1:09:46] your body will obey your confession
[1:09:52] and when you begin to conflate are you
[1:09:55] with me just now
[1:09:56] if you have to spend a few more minutes
[1:09:57] with me when you begin to confront
[1:10:00] not with your eyes and not with your
[1:10:03] ears what you're hearing right but when
[1:10:04] you confess the word of god
[1:10:07] and this message right more than just an
[1:10:10] intellectual message but when you begin
[1:10:12] to confess it
[1:10:14] he's my healer right he's my wayman
[1:10:17] regardless of what the circumstances are
[1:10:20] listen jesus operated in a realm of
[1:10:23] perfect faith
[1:10:25] perfect faith has no circumstances
[1:10:28] it's not looking to the symptoms and the
[1:10:30] situations that are around you
[1:10:32] let's look into a perfect god right
[1:10:34] that's right
[1:10:35] listen job said though god slay me you
[1:10:38] don't trust him
[1:10:39] amen that's right are you with me now
[1:10:42] all right
[1:10:43] god slay me you don't trust him
[1:10:50] when i was in business many years ago
[1:10:56] there were dry times just like all other
[1:10:59] companies that would go through dry
[1:11:01] times
[1:11:04] and it was i always
[1:11:08] told everybody around me we were so busy
[1:11:10] we were covered up
[1:11:16] knowing the phone wasn't ringing right
[1:11:19] right
[1:11:20] we were so busy we were not we were
[1:11:22] covered up yeah
[1:11:24] fine would hear that sometimes and
[1:11:26] almost chuckle
[1:11:29] but there came a time that we were
[1:11:33] a year in advance busy right yeah
[1:11:38] and when you're a chimney sweeper you're
[1:11:39] in advance busy it's a pretty good deal
[1:11:45] right are you with me now right
[1:11:49] why because we confessed in a great big
[1:11:52] god
[1:11:52] right and i believe it's more than just
[1:11:55] about your
[1:11:56] your activities of your day but i
[1:11:59] believe
[1:12:00] in our walk with god this is when we
[1:12:03] begin to
[1:12:04] believe that we're in the greatest
[1:12:06] revival we've ever been
[1:12:08] right right right that's right and we
[1:12:10] come to church with an expectation
[1:12:12] right god is going to come to my view
[1:12:14] today all right
[1:12:18] but you get what you're expecting
[1:12:21] and so many times we're expecting the
[1:12:23] minister to have all of these
[1:12:25] holidays keys crossed in his eyes dotted
[1:12:28] we're expecting him to
[1:12:29] to be be a revival for us but when we
[1:12:33] come in an attitude
[1:12:34] i am
[1:12:38] you looked every attitude in the eye and
[1:12:40] you've looked at demons in the eye and
[1:12:42] said
[1:12:42] hold on oh boy right yeah as for me in
[1:12:45] my house we're going to serve the lord
[1:12:48] and you throw every excuse right you
[1:12:50] throw every excuse away and say
[1:12:53] i'm going to serve god all right
[1:12:59] i know you're just like everybody else
[1:13:01] you're busy
[1:13:08] busyness is one of the worst enemies
[1:13:09] there is
[1:13:15] i find that retired people are the most
[1:13:18] busy people in the world
[1:13:19] right
[1:13:22] how in the world world did you go to
[1:13:24] work 40 hours a week
[1:13:28] how did you do it right people that are
[1:13:30] 75 years old
[1:13:32] are booked for weeks at a time
[1:13:35] i got one of the deacons in church
[1:13:37] brother bill
[1:13:39] and i'll call him what are you doing and
[1:13:41] he'll give me a wick
[1:13:43] itinerary yeah
[1:13:49] their young people don't have that kind
[1:13:50] of identity
[1:13:55] but we're not careful satan will so book
[1:13:58] us up
[1:14:13] in a spot right we're in a spot
[1:14:15] sometimes we come
[1:14:16] almost into a backslidden condition
[1:14:18] right
[1:14:19] right amen exactly exactly right what
[1:14:22] he's trying to do is break with the
[1:14:23] fellowship of god
[1:14:29] other brown talks about a little woman
[1:14:35] she had 17 children one of them was john
[1:14:38] wesley
[1:14:40] but she could find the time three hours
[1:14:42] a day to pray that's right yeah
[1:14:44] you go back and read history her husband
[1:14:46] wasn't a great big help
[1:14:48] that's right her husband was
[1:14:52] was an absentee father
[1:14:56] but she just didn't throw it in the way
[1:14:57] and say well here we are i'm going to
[1:14:59] have to live with what i've got
[1:15:00] she became known as the mother of
[1:15:02] methodists right
[1:15:04] because she was a praying woman when you
[1:15:07] find yourself in the circumstances of
[1:15:10] life and you find that things have been
[1:15:13] brought to you in a certain way hey
[1:15:15] listen don't just throw up your hands
[1:15:17] and say
[1:15:18] right well it ain't gonna get no better
[1:15:21] let me just say this to you take your
[1:15:24] position

[1:15:41] with that's the only young person in the
[1:15:43] entire school

[1:15:56] former cheerleaders and i watched them
[1:15:59] one by one as they came in
[1:16:01] and and i was thinking in my natural
[1:16:03] mind they'll never make it but today you
[1:16:05] could never pick them out of the rest of
[1:16:07] the system

[1:17:08] their food but they'll they'll buy their
[1:17:10] beer

[1:18:02] we'll allow ourselves to the enemy will

[1:18:06] and we'll go to the what if category
[1:18:12] being a pro ball player all they can
[1:18:14] have prolific careers
[1:18:16] but at the end of it they're something
[1:18:17] in a wheelchair

[1:27:48] i got my ear things on and i'm winging
[1:27:52] i didn't know it's a thunderstorm
[1:27:54] anywhere in the area
[1:27:56] they plugged in all that we did
[1:28:08] are you with me
[1:28:18] it's what you're doing right in the
[1:28:19] midst of your trial glory
[1:28:21] to help somebody else let's bow our head
[1:28:24] this morning lord jesus
[1:28:29] we love you this morning
[1:28:32] we have reported for duty one more time
[1:28:36] philly led as brother sam calling
[1:28:42] even before he would ask amen you had
[1:28:44] led me to go this direction
[1:28:49] because god will have a testimony amen
[1:28:52] he will have people that
[1:28:54] that will have lived the book of acts
[1:28:57] in this day that's right amen all right
[1:29:00] we could talk about the woman that was
[1:29:01] in memphis
[1:29:03] that had a little boy dying we could
[1:29:05] talk a little about the little mexican
[1:29:07] baby
[1:29:08] that the woman brought that was dead and
[1:29:10] the doctor told her to go bury her baby
[1:29:13] but what about the testimonies that said
[1:29:15] in this building that sit here tonight
[1:29:18] right that many circumstances come to
[1:29:20] their lives
[1:29:21] and you held them through that lord
[1:29:24] jesus i just asked you that
[1:29:26] as we remind even ourselves of these
[1:29:28] things that have happened
[1:29:30] lord we weren't the great one it was you
[1:29:34] we wasn't the important one it was you
[1:29:36] father
[1:29:38] lord jesus and we just thank you father
[1:29:42] that you watch over us that you are our
[1:29:45] protection
[1:29:46] you're our god why it would be an enemy
[1:29:50] that would destroy us in a moment's
[1:29:52] notice
[1:29:53] if they could only have the opportunity
[1:29:56] we have a protection around us that
[1:29:58] takes care of us
[1:30:00] lord there's young people sitting here
[1:30:02] today
[1:30:04] lord that maybe they don't know you in
[1:30:07] the fullness of what they should
[1:30:09] well i pray that you deal with their
[1:30:10] lives
[1:30:13] lord let them know that not to bypass
[1:30:16] their youth
[1:30:18] but to serve god with everything that is
[1:30:20] within them
[1:30:22] oh maybe they'd make some choices and
[1:30:25] and think though
[1:30:26] that everything is just so wonderful the
[1:30:28] way that they chose
[1:30:30] and then there begins to become some
[1:30:32] difficult days
[1:30:35] lord let them know that your grace is
[1:30:37] sufficient
[1:30:40] mercy can rewrite their lives
[1:30:43] lord jesus i pray that you'd speak to
[1:30:45] every one of our hearts this morning
[1:30:47] this is a service that we would say
[1:30:48] thank you

[1:31:03] ourselves for battle and we put on the
[1:31:05] armor of the lord
[1:31:06] and we bow our heads and pray the
[1:31:08] kingdom of hell shakes
[1:31:10] when we begin to read god's eternal word
[1:31:12] and it flows across our lips and we
[1:31:15] as we read it lord it's more than a a
[1:31:18] text right but it's a living reality
