TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you're in the dentist here in the dentist oh peace is in a dentist office they give you gas or something they must they must pay her out they must when you sign in there's something in the pen that starts giving you drugs if you think that's a common experience wow all right well let's talk about faith though sure sure sister Trudy must have a lot of faith in the dentist because okay all right now we're officially your coordinate all right good morning we'll get started just a little bit early now I want everybody to understand we've come to a place in the Statue of a perfect Amanda we're going to start talking about faith and faith is the new birth we've been talking about that before but let's let's today you know let's just put a nail in it and because if you don't if you if it's not in concrete this Foundation is is in concrete it's reinforced you know even the walls are reinforced and that keeps this building from falling down it's because the foundation was done correctly so if we do our foundation correctly and all of our foundations should be absolutely on faith faith not in yourself right right you know the world of taste it we'll have faith in yourself and I agree with that be positive have faith that you can do it worldly things you know your job and stuff like that but still as Christians we have to believe that we have faith that God is has a hand in everything that we do so we have to put our faith in back on him that he's the one who can do it because remember by yourself we're going to bounce up by ourselves we're going to make mistakes by ourselves we're not going to ever be good enough and I think that's a problem with a lot of us in here and in the church and I mean Church all over message churches is that we're not seeing you know we're not seeing great signs and wonders are great you know as far as what we I don't our expectation may be way up here but you got to remember one thing God is still here God is no more weak than he was that's right when he walked on the shores of Galilee it's just that we have to become that Temple that he can work through because he cannot work through anything else you say cannot yes because he chose to work through man he didn't choose to work through animals he'd choose to work through trees he didn't choose to work through uh cars or or even of the economy he didn't choose to do that he choose to do it through an individual men and women that he brought here on this Earth predestinated okay but you had to come down here to make a choice this is the part of you being here is the choice you have to make it's like brother Keith Ray were talking about last night choices look at all the examples that brother random gave about the prostitutes or the or um what was her name I told you last night Rosella remembered Rosella was a drunk and a mental institution she was a prostitute and brother Graham said look at her now she's winning sold for the Lord well she got over goodbye God's help she got over being what the choice she had made but the consequence was she was in that insane asylum and nobody could help her but brother random went there and helped her got down into the soul of the person not just the emotional part or the see that's what Alcoholics Anonymous does and that's what uh Reformation does it reforms you Alcoholics Anonymous is once an alcoholic always an alcoholic so stay away from it don't ever touch it don't ever get well become a Christian become a born-again Christian and that doesn't reform you that restores you restoration is bringing you back to where you didn't like that stuff to start with okay never understand what I'm saying that's where you can and you can't put all that I'm going to try to take a bunch of examples Maybe not today and we're going to put them together because individually that doesn't mean you're born again you can just have a good thought or or you have a strong will to quit something yes that's just Alcoholics Anonymous that's Reformation but to restore you is restoring the whole person that's why I believe brother random had to come and preach the statue of a perfect man to show that God can and will restore not reform restore a group of people back to a position because he wants like a priest the other day on the glorification there's two glorifications there's one down here at the bottom of the pyramid When God says this is my beloved Son and whom I'm pleased to dwell and then there's another glorification because he said I'll glorify it now and I'll glorify it again what through the son of man which is the word made flesh and that's what you and R you and I are are the word made flesh all right we got to start believing that that even our flesh has to yield to what's inside of us we've got to see that this flesh is nothing more than a shell it's a it's a um framework something that when your Mom and Daddy got together there was a DNA of this germ and the DNA of this germ and they come together and they formed a life the egg created the body right the egg from the female which is a very wonderful type of the word of God because the father is the only one that has seed you understand what I mean let's talk natural for just a second father's gonna want to have seed so I'm trying to build your faith how do you got here and how that God's going to build you up so you don't have you that baby don't have seed the baby is C the father has a seed the the sperm right unless it connects with the female it's not it's just that it's there's no there's no connection to it so you didn't come here with a seed in you yes your father had to see and when it connected with the mother which the Bible says the mother is the word of God and even the Bible says the seed is a word so you have to put them both together it's the word quickening the word because remember and and I want to give you the quote where brother Brown said it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God but the seed or word so it's not the person that comes it's not the Gwen solace or what you wanted before Brown didn't come because I'm going back to before she was married it did not produce a child of God It produced a child of the Browns given us all by God yes perfect and then Satan comes in and perverts it but he can't create a song He perverts that Soul gives it a fallen nature now if you don't get rid of that that thing permeates that Soul so much so like what blackens it out Darkness it can't grow but it's not a seed of God in you as in the baptism of the Holy Ghost as in the new birth I believe you have to receive that but where does it come from your daddy comes to your mama right and then that is what is quicker than you are planted in you you don't have this eternal germ you have an eternal representation you're represented eternally from God and and to a trained audience you can say you was born with eternal life because potentially somewhere if you were ever going to have it God put it somewhere but he put it in the word right he's got to be a choice that you make everybody understand that's a choice God knew what choice you made but you didn't had there been no fall we would have come just completely perfect any way you look at it we would have come the spoken word is the Original Seed so it was spoken word from the beginning and it's got to go back to spoken word now right in between there was a fall that's why this had to come brother Brown said God let you come down in this to make your choice he knew what choice you'd make if you're born again if you're born again truly born again you know what George you're going to make because you made that choice am I understand that pretty simple but very complex but I don't want you to see one I want you to see one thing that you have to live by faith not that God has already placed something in you and you have nothing to do and and obviously you don't didn't have a thing to get yourself you know had nothing to do with getting yourself here we know that that was Divine Providence but God knowing when you've got here that you would desire it more than life itself he brought you him why that he could he could bring other people that will never be able to come to to eternal life because he knew if Adolf Hitler lived a million years he would never come and never get on his knees and say God I'm sorry for what I did okay so therefore I can see predestination because this is being predetermined by God this is predetermined there's nothing you can do about it but you do when you get here though you get here to make a choice and then when we make it's not just making that choice it's then we got to take these virtues and let them come back out okay well see people take the quote where brother Brown said to you all what you know you were seed that's how you can be reborn well that's right because it was in here it wasn't in you right right the Bible says the seed is the word of God and you were not born word first Jesus was born word first right because he comes straight from God the germ was from God or the sperm was from God and the Egg was from God so man had nothing to do with that he comes straight from God that's why he could say before Abraham was I am you can't say that you can say that by the inside man that's right you say way before that but see you can't say that outwardly because it stumbles people we got to be really mature to sometimes talk about this but I don't want I'd rather I'd rather be so immature that we understand we got to be born again we understand that we've got to have something to do you say oh we got nothing to do with you got to say yes or no Eve made a choice Jesus she said yes she could have said no she could have said no and got behind her husband and that would have been it but she made a choice Cain made a choice every person has been on the face of this Earth that has come to the age of accountability has made a choice so that way God that way Adolf Hitler can't come up and say God you created me this way why are you sending me to hell and sending this person to heaven God said one day I came to you because he come from a religious family he was part of you so why didn't he he said because what you chose I gave it to you right here I believe he'll tell every person on the face of this Earth that's come to the age of accountability he'll say I tried to contact you right here and that person is going to have to remember that because like Peter said yesterday he said there's a time where you that every one of them that run around related those questions they took him back to the very spot remember even the soldier that the priest said you need to go find God where you left him and he said now lay me down to sleep well he knew right then where he left God so you'll go right back to where you left God and it'll be quick into your mind and you'll say okay well see then there's the Judgment then you walk away from the Bible but whatever took place during this time that's right absolutely same way with us same way with you and I so that's what we respond to it's like a little quote that I made a long time ago when I was preaching a sermon it's it's God knew what part of the Bible you would need and he had it right here knowing that one day you would respond to that part of that Bible you responded to some part of this you didn't respond to Greer's Almanac or or you know modern day for living and all no he didn't respond to that you responded to somebody somebody read a scripture and preached a sermon or somebody talked about God well where's God in order and then that quickens something in your heart and you didn't relate back to that person you related back to the scripture all right no I'm good no not one but be there for perfect I can see both you got to come to an altar and it's it's hard to read in in the in the message of the hour because brother Ryan would say I've got one book at home and I probably since I put it up moving my stuff but you can flip the book open and I can't remember the name of it right here on top of the page it says you were not born on any certain day you always was eternal then right down here at your very bottom he's calling an altar call and he says your eternal life starts at the altar all right now he's not confused he's up here in the mind of God and he's down here talking to people does everybody get that Kathy didn't because I see the pearls in her brain in her face well see in the mind of God you always will return that's right right if he sees one sin of yours you're a goner just put it in my term you're you're out of here so if you have eternal life that part of eternal life on this page he's preaching always was eternal you never was born on any certain day that's because this was right here the Bible the word of God was here for you before you got here not after you got here before you got him that's right okay so here we go let me let me finish with Texas okay right here eternal life brother right on the same because like I said one time before brother Brown is preaching to an audience and he goes into the mind of God and if they're born again he sees nothing but eternal life purity no certain day you were born no no you know you always were Eternal you were this eternal seed of God true but now when he comes down and starts preaching to humanity same sermon he's preaching to the people that are sinners and he can see that he's a prophet he can see the light of the dark or the light of the dark well the lice already got the light they don't need it no more but the dark he sees on the people and he says eternal life starts down here at the altar you need to come down here to receive eternal life those that already had it didn't need it no more everybody understand that those are out there didn't need internal life no more so I just like to preach everybody like the brothers they preach everybody lost and then let you make the choice because if we started preaching right now that you always was eternal you never was um lost you never you you didn't need to do this you didn't need to do that you just need to believe the message and come to church we just have a bunch of rotten centers we feel this church full we'd have to build another one that's for sure but I thank God we're not doing that but we have preachers in a message that do preach that all you got to do is just believe believe the message believe what the Bible says believe it you got to keep believing that's right we can't have a beginning it can't happen again that's where brother I don't could say you weren't born on any certain day born again because in the mind of God this is permissive and he only looks through the blood he can't see this that we're doing right now you know what the prophet said the bumper blood covers the earth and he looks and sees the blood and that's all he sees he doesn't see through that okay so in the mind of God Ryan had no day he began because Ryan was always in his mind in Genesis 1 26 and 27 that man didn't develop in Genesis 1 26 it was written so that we could understand that at a point in time there was something set aside called God big God that was set aside that would come later so that's what will happen that's what happened if Adam and Eve would have not Fallen that Genesis 1 26 and 27 we would have just started coming coming forward but now that we're in this to make him go down across my sins made him go down across he didn't have to right did he have to no he didn't have to go down he went and died knowing we were lost how can you have an eternal seed in if you're lost you have a representation that you'll come to it but uh you know the Bible says God will dwell in an unclean vessel now I don't know where you get that and then the Bible also says the unclean Spirit goes out of a person so it was in there so God and God and the devil can't reside in the same place at the same time so God gave us a life and we were by Nature by Nature I'm hoping scripture Paul says by nature of the children of Wrath as others so see that puts us right here with the sinners not way up there right here as others remember I read through the scripture that time where he says whoremongers and revilers and all that Paul just was naming this whole congregation he said such for some of you but you're washed right no he should have said you always was eternal what's your problem you don't have to repent you always want you always was what a liar or a thief or a golfer no you have to come to a knowledge and that's what we're going to talk about with faith maybe just for a few minutes but let me answer if God can reveal to us because Jesus said before Abraham was I am but we know that flesh right you see that difference that's correct that's right that flash of Jesus had a beginning it was the sacrifice it was the sacrificial lamb right but now Isaiah 53 didn't say he gave his body an offering for sin his body was a sacrifice his soul was the offering that's what I wasaiah 53 says he didn't say he gave us flashing offering for sin he gave his flesh as a sacrifice that was a sacrificial lamb that they brought up without spot or blemish because remember buy your stripes he's healed that has no condition of Christianity right proved for our iniquity and all those things that has no condition for Christianity boom he gave his soul a ransom to get your soul out that was the man that was the man that was the very soul of almighty God so Jesus the flesh was a sacrifice there's no condition of being healed and you have to be a Christian but if he gives his soul for your soul there's the Redemption he redeemed your soul he renames that soul and that's what he went to hell for remember he went to hell in his soul he went to hell to preach to the souls in prison and you and I were in Saul in his soul he was at Genesis 1 26 and 27 man right and see how preachers say well Jesus Jesus just came to uh to tell us we were wrong and then to realize that we always was eternal well then he should have told Nicodemus he should have said Nicodemus he always was eternal just just come on and join me and we'll all be happy and no I found what he said he said you must be something different than what you are now right you must be born from above not from down here that's right this is where our problem is but we've got to have faith and it goes back to just simple faith that Jesus Christ died for your sins on the cross your sins not brother Dale that's not mine up he died for your sin he went up there with you in his mind I'm going to redeem done that's what I believe he walked up there and got on that cross and said I'm going to redeem way devil that's what I'm there for but he's got to come to a place because you know what that light was inside that man eternal life was inside Jesus Christ right in that shell of a human the sacrifice but when the blood cell was broken it released the life out of that sacrifice because remember that was a type in the Old Testament when that life left that animal remember the blood was a covering but couldn't that life of that animal couldn't come into that man and make him quit doing what he was doing but when Jesus came it was human life it was a human life he gave so that human life that he gave was able to not only cover the sand but to totally do away with it because he came back and become the stimulus one when he comes in you he makes you a sandwich one inside but we gotta fight the outside guy that's why it's a stat drove a perfect man right which starts by faith so let's read chapter 11. but I want you to understand you've got you have got to come to a realization that one day you heard sure you heard from your theophany theophany word body word body theophany is a word body not a body your mom and daddy gave you it's a word body and you were not born word you were born lost Doom on your way to Hell a liar yes I've got too much Bible that says I was that they had to take one quote where program said John you always loved Eternal and you never was born on any certain day that's the mind of God talking to you don't understand what I'm saying because remember there's a lot of times we get in ourself yes all of us not just preachers we all get in ourselves and we say things that maybe we shouldn't say yes but now when it comes from God and you and you respond and the preacher is preaching the word of God and you respond to the word of God and you and there's a something just clicks inside that's God talking to you so we may go up here this afternoon or this morning and daddy preached something and I've heard 75 times you too you've heard it long after a lot of you've been with him overnight okay but something clicks something clicked and you say I've never seen that before well Daddy Mass added 150 times why it wasn't time for that to quicken in you you had to come to a place of expectation you trigger this whole thing amen you're the hole trigger whether you get anything up here down here any anything you're the key because God will use a preacher like I said we're servants we're just a conduit we're a pipe and if God needs to go and move that pipe over this way to your way I mean how many times you've been sitting in a sermon and he's like man I ain't getting nothing out of this but somebody right over here about three pews from you is absolutely about to jump out of their seat why because they responded to what the word of God was for their time maybe it wasn't your time yet and we can all Rejoice but there's a time when you've got to lay it down in the word and say this is where it come from right here and this is where I heard it and I believe it that's why it says now Faith is the substance now things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it what by faith the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God or the seed of God everything comes from seed I mean that's just the way life is everything comes from seed right thank you so that things which are seen in other words be hell were not made by things which do appear see we take iron and metal and plastic and rubber and we put a car together well you can see the iron in plastic metal and rubber God made this from zero so I gotta have faith that if that God can make something from zero he can make something from zero he can take him blank all that out all that old life that past life like brothers been talking about you're going to remember it but you got to come to a certain place in your life to say look I can't do a thing about one another because in the past Satan's going to bring it up every day that's his job right he's good at what he does but God's better I'm exciting very good at his job but he's only he's only God's secretary or he used to be right-hand man so God's still number one but what you got to do is you got to reflect back into the word and say hey this is what I believe we've got to keep pouring it back to the word of God that's why I said even into Daniel 70 weeks that's what I want you to believe in all the things that's being preached here don't just take it for face value right look into the word if brother Brown said anything on Book and Tape and it sounds you hear me sounds contrary to the word it's your Revelation that's wrong my Revelation this wrong he's not William Brown's Revelation that's wrong and the Bible's not wrong we have to come to an absolute we know that brother Brown did make mistakes in his sermons but he corrected those no one corrects a prophet but God all right so I I you know that's why I don't have time for these people that want to correct brother Branham then we need to just throw our books and tapes away we need to fill his church school because he's the next prophet or them or whoever it is Rod Bergen or Jeremy Bergen or or whoever I don't care the name of their names because they're filth to me filthy people they've taken souls to hell and I reckon they just don't care so but if we don't watch it we can say well brother Brown said we always was eternal well there was a there's a point there the Bible said you're lost so brother Brown can't be saying something different what the Bible said but the mind of God tells us that we're sitting in Heavenly places if we're mourning in right now it's like brother Kendra said last night Heavenly places if we're in heaven there's no bad thoughts there's no animosity there's no memory I'll pass only Perfection you're not hurting everything's fine you're not worried about time he just lists a bunch of things and we're not there but wait a minute the Bible says that if you're born again you are risen sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus not in the world it says in Christ Jesus that's right okay so you get you get what I'm talking about you can make quotes but you got to put them all together so that's right right that's in your soul you're sitting in Heavenly places in your soul why because that's what came to you Heaven has come to Earth inside here but we as humans as the old carnal nature of man it's kind of like I've always said about a a pill if anybody's got a pill you know your little capsule it it it's got all the good stuff inside right but what's on the outside of it is holding it in and unless it gets in the right environment and dissolves that all outside thing it's glycerin actually is what it is plastic once it goes in your stomach what happens to that it dissolves and lets the good stuff out carnal comparison but that's what you and I are we're a capsule with the Holy Ghost Inside everything that we need but if we don't put that thing in a good environment to dissolve that outside man and his ideas and his Doctrine then once inside it's not going to be here but once it's put in the right environment a warm environment and a good Christian atmosphere then that capsule just you can't find it anymore you just see that the medicine done good that's why I see for the Teaching Ministry of the birth and said those two verses that those two states that you're called me back and until the holy ghost shows you're a teacher that's why brother around said teaching places you in the body why it does not confuse you a lot of others can confuse you an evangelist can be confusing if he comes in and throws out some things and leaves but he has his part because what he'll do is he'll spark some he may spark something to preacher the pastor that's here all the time that's one of the evangelists should do and even that's what I try to do when I go out I try to preach to the preacher because I'm there for one day okay you understand what I'm saying I'm preaching to the preacher because if he catches what I'm saying and this is going to tell you but I really don't care if they do I know I'm strange I'm like my dad but if they don't catch a thing but if that preacher can catch what I'm saying he's got 52 weeks a year to sit there and pound it in the people and if they get it praise God I don't care who it comes from but I preach the preachers now y'all I don't y'all I don't because y'all you know I brag about you all the time y'all The Best of the Best but I guess a lot of people hadn't heard any of this that we're talking about nothing but if I sparked that preacher's interest and he can start digging and digging and digging and digging and he preaches it to the people and they get it that's why Paul would stay with one convert one he would get that one convert in the mindset of God and then he would release him and say Ethiopian eunuch right Stephen I mean uh Philip got into a place he could understand the scripture so brother Graham said he went and Ethiopia he had a Revival well hey Philip couldn't have been there the whole time but that Ethiopian unit could okay thank you all right let's go we're behind again yeah
