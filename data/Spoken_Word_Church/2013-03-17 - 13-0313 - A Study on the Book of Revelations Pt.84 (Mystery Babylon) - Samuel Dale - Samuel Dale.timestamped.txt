[7:54] everything well because we believe you
[7:56] and we thank you in Jesus name
[8:00] amen Revelations
[8:03] 1 we've been reading for quite a while
[8:06] on this so maybe we'll get down to the
[8:08] end of it one of these days since the
[8:10] revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[8:12] gave unto him to sh unto his servants
[8:15] things which must shortly come to pass
[8:18] and he said and signified it by his
[8:19] Angel unto his servant John who by
[8:22] record of the word of God and the
[8:24] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[8:26] things that he saw blessed is he that
[8:29] read and they that hear the words of
[8:30] this prophecy and keep those things
[8:32] which are written therein for what the
[8:36] time is at hand I believe that more
[8:39] every day don't you okay Revelation
[8:45] 17 and there came one of the Seven
[8:48] Angels which had the seven vows and
[8:50] talked with me saying unto me come
[8:52] hither I will you unto thee the Judgment
[8:56] of the great horde that sit up on upon
[8:58] many Waters with whom the kings of the
[9:00] Earth have committed fornication and the
[9:02] inhabitants of the Earth have been made
[9:05] drunk with the wine of her fornication
[9:07] so he carried me away into the spirit
[9:09] Into the Wilderness and I saw a woman
[9:11] sit upon a Scarlet cuted Beast full of
[9:14] names of blasphemia having seven heads
[9:17] and 10 horns and the one was arrayed in
[9:20] purple and scarlet color and decked with
[9:23] gold and precious stones and Pearls
[9:26] having a golden cup in her hand full of
[9:28] abomination
[9:29] and filthiness of her fornication and
[9:32] upon her forehead was a name written
[9:34] mystery Babylon the great the mother of
[9:37] harlots and Abominations of the earth
[9:40] and I saw the woman drunken with the
[9:41] blood of the Saints and with the blood
[9:43] of the martyrs of Jesus and when I saw
[9:46] her I wondered with great
[9:50] admiration and the angel said unto me
[9:52] orfor this thou Marvel I will tell thee
[9:55] The Mystery of the woman and of the
[9:57] Beast that carried carried her which
[10:00] hath the seven heads and 10 horns you
[10:03] may be seated The Lord At His blessings
[10:06] to the reading of the word now we're
[10:07] going to have maybe a couple of more
[10:10] services uh picking up maybe a little
[10:13] bit in the 18th chapter Sunday and then
[10:17] try to get
[10:18] into uh more of a positive attitude of
[10:22] talking about the bride of Christ and
[10:24] spend instead of spending so much time
[10:27] uh talking about organizing religions
[10:29] and things and that's what we desire to
[10:32] to get into you know for this day I
[10:35] asked brother Joe if he would and wait
[10:37] these are some if you want to give them
[10:39] out to some that don't have especially
[10:41] the internet ask brother Joe and them to
[10:43] pull it up because uh you know I know
[10:46] the religious world uh is booming today
[10:50] because there is a new pope and you know
[10:54] a new
[10:56] leader and you know I don't say much
[10:58] about these things like that because you
[11:01] know if you was in the Baptist you'd go
[11:03] down and vote on the president or the
[11:05] head of the Baptist Association you know
[11:07] it's just a little difference in the
[11:09] line but um you know this quote here of
[11:13] the Prophet about the pope coming out of
[11:16] the United States and my wife asked me
[11:19] today said if you look that up lately I
[11:20] said well no it's been really quite a
[11:22] while cuz I wasn't concerned about it
[11:25] you know everybody was expecting this
[11:27] Pope to be the one to come out of the
[11:29] United States and I think that what was
[11:31] that man's name Malachi that had had the
[11:33] visions and all this was supposed to
[11:35] been the the last Pope and his name was
[11:38] to be Peter and and all of these things
[11:41] you know so you can get it all set up
[11:43] I've always told you I don't look for
[11:47] the pope coming out of the United States
[11:48] to put us in the
[11:50] Rapture I look for the revelation of the
[11:52] word of God to do that whatever comes
[11:56] out if you you Scout Hallelujah that it'
[11:59] be here but you know so you just
[12:01] there'll be a lot of topes and shadows
[12:03] of of going about among the people of
[12:06] the message that they'll be saying of
[12:08] this that the other of this Pope uh
[12:10] about how that he was elected on the
[12:12] 13th day and the 13th Hour 13th this and
[12:18] all of that and and they admit that he
[12:20] is the first Jesuit priest you know that
[12:23] ever come up to the Jesuit side of the
[12:26] church and all of this and the first one
[12:29] out of this section of the world and all
[12:31] this that and the other but I just
[12:33] wanted to read to you and this for those
[12:34] on the internet that don't have the
[12:36] ability or maybe they didn't find it uh
[12:39] let's just read what the prophet had to
[12:40] say and then we'll get back into our
[12:42] thought about it this is taken from the
[12:45] acts of the Holy Spirit preach in
[12:48] Jeffersonville Indiana in 1954
[12:51] 1219 the evening service paragraph
[12:56] 87 I believe one of these glorious days
[12:59] when this United Confederation of church
[13:02] goes together and the new pope is
[13:05] brought out of the United States and put
[13:07] over there according to prophecy then
[13:10] they'll form an image like unto the
[13:12] Beast I tell you the True Church of God
[13:15] will be drove together the real true
[13:17] believers out of Methodist Baptist
[13:19] Presbyterian Pentecostal nazarine
[13:21] Pilgrim Holiness whatever they'll be
[13:24] will go together and cemented by the
[13:27] love of God that'll make the body of the
[13:29] Lord Jesus Christ all the Believers and
[13:32] agnostics and shallow minded will be
[13:35] cast to one side they'll go right on
[13:37] into the confederation of churches now
[13:41] uh see everybody's looking for the pope
[13:43] to come out of the United States but I
[13:44] believe what you need to be looking for
[13:46] is this right here before that PO
[13:48] exactly right I believe he's putting the
[13:52] emphasis
[13:54] upon that more than just it's the same
[13:57] emphasis right you got to admit that see
[14:01] but look what he's saying one of these
[14:02] days glor day when the United
[14:04] Confederation of churches goes together
[14:08] well I'd rather look for the churches
[14:11] going together than the pope out of the
[14:12] United
[14:15] States and you know according to my
[14:19] understanding then it's got to be close
[14:22] to the end when it would be to that the
[14:27] confederation of churches would come
[14:28] together right and we would be driven
[14:31] together MH now that's what he says in
[14:34] there we would drive together uh the
[14:36] real True Believer you say yeah but
[14:38] we're not going to be in no bad problems
[14:39] we're not going to be in no time well
[14:43] yeah they're getting together now by the
[14:45] confederation of churches they're
[14:47] getting a new pope he may be live two
[14:51] days and die and they'll get him another
[14:52] one who worries but that's what I'm
[14:55] saying is that every emphasis is made
[14:57] upon it without really even thinking
[15:00] about it that it's not going to be the
[15:02] pope out of the United States put us in
[15:05] the Rapture it's going to be the
[15:07] revealed word of God and if we don't
[15:10] have
[15:11] that we might as well do and I would
[15:14] happen to be watching it sister Trudy
[15:16] called me today and said that they had
[15:18] you know the white smoke had went up and
[15:21] so I just went and clicked it on you
[15:23] know what I happened to get to view it
[15:24] did any of you get to view him then
[15:26] coming out and announcing who he was
[15:29] I mean I did I just happened to be you
[15:31] know I clicked it on I thought well I
[15:33] don't never look at stuff like this you
[15:35] know and I just clicked it up and there
[15:37] it was I saw him come out and announce
[15:39] who he was and everything like that but
[15:43] that didn't make nothing to me what
[15:46] makes me is a revealed word
[15:49] right because if it comes up that the
[15:52] pope comes out of the United States what
[15:53] are you going to do you going to go out
[15:56] and jump up in the air yeah and be r
[16:00] I don't think that's going to be what
[16:02] it's going to be I think it's going to
[16:05] be the revealed word right I've always
[16:08] believed it that way maybe if I'm wrong
[16:10] then I guess we missed a whole lot but
[16:13] now so just put it on that point and
[16:16] think about it a little bit now back up
[16:19] just a higher into Revelations chapter
[16:23] 16 in verse 16 and we talked about the
[16:26] three unclean spirits like frogs coming
[16:29] out of the mouth of someone bringing the
[16:32] world to
[16:34] Armageddon and the prophet never used
[16:37] anything of talking about Russia China
[16:40] India whatever coming down he spoke of
[16:43] Protestants and Catholics coming
[16:47] together gathering around
[16:50] Jerusalem and that's what's right there
[16:52] now right because on the Russian side
[16:56] you
[16:57] have plenty of Methodist Baptist
[17:00] Presbyterian Pentecostal right on the
[17:02] other side of India or something like
[17:04] that or China coming down you you have
[17:06] Christians
[17:08] andtime but see it has to tie together
[17:11] as I was trying to show you that to
[17:13] where that you and I are having a
[17:15] spiritual battle of Armageddon which is
[17:17] the Battle of the Mind Right amen you
[17:20] know the greatest battle ever fought in
[17:22] being fult right now within our minds to
[17:24] get us to the basis that we can stand it
[17:27] right because just because that that
[17:30] somebody comes along and says the bus is
[17:32] in the parking
[17:34] lot now that might have been a hey day
[17:37] when Le some of you was working at
[17:40] McDonald's you know you you knew if a
[17:43] bus was in the parking lot you're going
[17:45] to be working like crazy for a while but
[17:48] see if I told you the bus is out in the
[17:50] parking lot now and us stay in here that
[17:53] wouldn't do much good right no we got to
[17:57] get on the bus you know what I mean we
[18:00] got to get into the revealed word amen
[18:03] cuz that's going to be the bust to take
[18:05] us out of here not just because some
[18:07] natural happening takes place right all
[18:11] right see in that way you you don't have
[18:13] to worry about it and you say well
[18:14] brother Dale you've always been yep I've
[18:17] always been optimistic pessimistic I
[18:20] guess that's just the way I am I just
[18:22] don't look at things with too much value
[18:25] unless it's got a value to it yeah all
[18:28] right but if it does have a value I'll
[18:30] hang on to it yes I have certain things
[18:32] at my house that that there's not enough
[18:34] money in the world to be able to get
[18:36] them and to you it wouldn't be valuable
[18:39] enough
[18:40] to you know even need get
[18:43] life I have things people gave me that
[18:46] that I would part with every dime I had
[18:48] in my pocket before I part with that
[18:49] because I value
[18:51] that we say wait
[18:54] talk I I value this revealed word amen
[18:58] am and I I sat down now and I just read
[19:01] the book of Revelations and I know I've
[19:02] talked to some of
[19:04] you and I read the book of Revelation
[19:06] now you know what it's not such a
[19:08] mysterious thing I mean you read about
[19:10] this mystery
[19:13] Babylon all right now you can go down
[19:16] and read of what it's got to do with
[19:18] Babylon confusion and the Two Babylons
[19:20] and the you bringing up and down and
[19:22] scopio does those things in his
[19:24] footnotes and he can bring down and
[19:27] bring you some of these
[19:28] uh beasts and animals Etc
[19:34] but what does that mean to you and I to
[19:37] bring it down into Simplicity and see as
[19:40] I said to you that from Revelations
[19:43] about chapter 6 to where we are now in
[19:46] chapter 17 tonight is only like a 3 and
[19:50] 1/2 year period of time right called
[19:52] Jacob's trouble the tribulation period
[19:56] all right and all of these things are
[19:57] taking place there in that time but we
[20:01] are seeing it as it builds up to that
[20:03] that's the point I tried to make where
[20:05] you with the compound meaning compound
[20:07] revelation we see the things working up
[20:10] to that even right now if you said well
[20:14] we're going to we're going to all gather
[20:16] around Jerusalem well it could do it in
[20:18] Jed our plan yes but if you had to
[20:20] depend on getting a lot of people there
[20:23] you would take boats and things like
[20:25] that and it would take months to be able
[20:26] to prepare and get people together right
[20:30] to come around and get around that place
[20:33] but we can just see it as it's unfolding
[20:36] getting
[20:38] ready and we can see who these things
[20:40] are and what it is that it's the mystery
[20:44] Babylon and that mystery Babylon is
[20:47] the Catholic church
[20:51] amen but she's the mother of Harlot amen
[20:55] and we can see that that's organized
[20:57] religion
[20:59] I'll read you one in a minute where
[21:00] brother rown said that the Catholic
[21:02] church was the first organized religion
[21:04] he said in the Lutheran was the second
[21:08] one in Zig and on coming down see
[21:12] all the prophet of God said the Catholic
[21:15] church say that you know we were the
[21:18] original church he said I'll agree you
[21:21] right you're exactly right but not the
[21:25] Roman Catholic Church Catholic means
[21:28] Universal right right the book of Acts
[21:31] was a universal church right the bride
[21:34] of Christ yes
[21:36] Lord but then when you put Catholic and
[21:39] Roman together then you're getting the
[21:41] wrong idea right of what things are
[21:44] going on but I do I just sit down and
[21:45] read and I look at it and I think all of
[21:49] these things that God wrote
[21:51] about and it can be done in 3 and 1/2
[21:54] years you
[21:56] know and we we we're here now by way of
[22:00] the Prophet messenger being able to see
[22:03] these things and
[22:06] know how they started even in Genesis Y
[22:10] and worked its way all the way through
[22:12] the Bible but then the Bible would sum
[22:14] up the Book of Revelation would sum it
[22:16] up into a short period of time and the
[22:19] many things that I've been on now for
[22:21] week after week after week after week
[22:23] it's only 3 and 1/2 years I can preach 3
[22:25] and 1/2 years off of what I see on about
[22:28] of these things and I'm sure you
[22:30] probably believe that the way I do
[22:33] but now
[22:36] listen we ought to thank God that we can
[22:41] see right amen these
[22:45] things that was once mysterious and you
[22:49] know we stay I told you and I said it
[22:52] the other day to a a lady you
[22:56] know about the Book of Revelations how
[22:59] long I've been in preaching she she just
[23:03] you could tell she just we don't we
[23:06] don't read them that much we we know and
[23:09] then she seemed she was going wrong and
[23:11] she seemed she said now I don't mean we
[23:13] don't read book of re I I mean in our
[23:17] church things we just don't talk much
[23:20] about the Book of Revelation so you go
[23:22] out and talk to people and see if you
[23:23] don't get it to amen right but you see
[23:26] it's simple to us now
[23:28] the symbols is broken amen right that's
[23:31] right the things that we see are taking
[23:35] place right Among Us amen right this
[23:38] confederation of churches that we just
[23:40] read about it's now getting together
[23:43] right right
[23:45] amen bringing everybody together into
[23:48] the same common
[23:54] belief and what a beautiful thing it is
[24:02] is that
[24:05] right now you think about
[24:10] it and you let have you I know
[24:16] carnal had you rather have this church
[24:18] sitting over here right beside of us and
[24:21] it's more beautiful than ours
[24:23] you but had you'd rather have that
[24:26] sitting there or a beer joint
[24:30] or honky
[24:31] dong I'm not throwing off on those
[24:34] people I'm trying to get you to think
[24:36] and we have nothing to do with them we

[24:54] over 100,000 people
[24:56] gathered and holler and Viva Pope or VI

[25:13] about what we

[25:18] not even counting all of us no I ain't
[25:19] counting all us cuz it ain't going to
[25:21] work on
[25:22] everybody but some people are going to
[25:24] see it and believe it and be happy about
[25:26] it right
[25:28] I'm happy that it's come to an
[25:31] end come on for no other reason I'm
[25:34] getting
[25:36] old number one talking to a guy today
[25:39] and he said how old are I said 72 he
[25:40] said I'm 74 I said I ain't too bad he
[25:43] said them two years is
[25:48] bad
[25:50] you but listen Church most of us sitting
[25:54] here are over the age you know the word
[25:57] time is very
[25:59] valuable and if we don't get out of here
[26:03] they going to be some funerals preached
[26:06] because of the natural thing no no now
[26:08] brother Dale God's going to let every
[26:09] one of us live to be 140 but I I don't
[26:12] want to be
[26:13] 140 I just don't want to do that I'm
[26:16] sorry right but now listen
[26:21] Church looking at and I know that now in
[26:25] the message it's beginning and I'm not
[26:26] jealous of nobody or nothing we can have
[26:28] a beautiful church and a lot of payments
[26:30] you know and probably not as many
[26:32] payments as a lot of people have but I'm
[26:34] just trying to make a point they're
[26:36] beginning to get a lot of churches in
[26:38] the message now that are
[26:40] beautiful and that's
[26:42] wonderful then you don't owe a payment
[26:44] until it's
[26:46] due if you paying $10,000 a month you
[26:49] don't owe that payment until it's due
[26:52] amen it's not no bad
[26:56] thing it it's not nothing to do is like
[26:59] the scripture that says ow no man
[27:00] nothing we know the what the prophet
[27:02] said about that right that doesn't mean
[27:04] you can't owe your bills and buy your
[27:07] cars and make payments on it and it just
[27:09] means when you try to beat the people
[27:11] out of it you know they old no man
[27:14] nothing
[27:16] y i i told a lady d getting my haircut
[27:21] that I wanted to keep her in debt to me
[27:23] cuz i' owed her for a haircut and I had
[27:25] to pay her for two of them today and and
[27:28] uh she always just says forget it Sam
[27:30] don't worry and I said no I want to keep
[27:32] you in debt to
[27:36] me no that ain't right I said yeah that
[27:39] is right I want to keep you in debt to
[27:43] me because that way I may need something
[27:46] someday and she owes me you know if I
[27:50] keep her in debt to me all right but now
[27:53] the point
[27:56] is
[27:58] this Bible is opened now right amen this
[28:03] this book is open Amen to we can read
[28:06] from Genesis to
[28:10] Revelations and I don't mean that I
[28:12] understand everything that's in there I
[28:13] didn't say that but I'm just saying that
[28:16] we can read it with understanding until
[28:20] we can see what's going on right amen
[28:24] and it's not that we used to well what's
[28:26] your opinion or what that
[28:28] means you
[28:30] know right it's not bad
[28:33] it's God's word amen that he's given
[28:36] into the hands of the bride of Christ
[28:38] right
[28:40] amen for her to be able to
[28:43] read I've told you over and over how
[28:46] many times have I preached on you that
[28:48] the that the Book of Revelations is a
[28:50] bride's book amen how many times have I
[28:52] made that
[28:54] statement see we can read it it's
[28:56] talking right in in the very day and the
[28:58] hour that we're
[28:59] living you want to know what's going on
[29:02] read
[29:03] it turn around and read about Israel
[29:06] right amen that's the two things I read
[29:09] I I keep the I watch you know in the
[29:11] what I can see on the internet or what I
[29:13] can do if it's anything about Israel I
[29:15] I'll read it you know I I want to keep
[29:17] up with them but I want to keep up where
[29:20] you and I are at right amen we're right
[29:23] here in a beautiful time that we
[29:24] understand and and see what these things
[29:26] mean
[29:29] yep that's right and Marvel at the
[29:36] Simplicity you know a mystery until it's
[29:38] revealed is totally away from your in
[29:41] intellectual abilities right now you
[29:44] know what I mean by that you can read it
[29:46] we read mystery babyon the Harlot you
[29:48] know the mother of whes and whatever we
[29:51] read them as a Baptist Methodist well
[29:52] what did we know but see now we can read
[29:55] it and see exactly what it's talking
[29:57] about
[30:00] Y and in seeing it then it just
[30:04] unfolds that we can read for ourselves
[30:08] right what is talking about
[30:12] us that even that God would think so
[30:15] much of it until you know now this is a
[30:17] point I've tried to get across for the
[30:19] longest
[30:21] that in the Book of
[30:23] Revelations the bride is not seen after
[30:27] Revelations 41 she's in heaven
[30:31] amen she comes back in Revelations 19
[30:34] but yet God doesn't leave it with
[30:37] without showing
[30:39] us so we'll get to it like Sunday on
[30:42] Revelation 184 come out of her my people
[30:44] right that's compound meaning right
[30:46] Israel coming out of the World Council
[30:49] systems and and all that Us coming out
[30:51] of the church
[30:53] yeah God doesn't just put it all this I
[30:56] said over here and right in the middle
[30:59] of all of it he'll lay something down
[31:00] for us to look at that's a beautiful
[31:02] Jewel
[31:04] amen that's what I've always tried to
[31:06] tell you that you reading the Bible and
[31:08] you read back there you know and you
[31:10] read so and so beg got so and so and so
[31:12] and so beg got so and so and so and so
[31:13] for got so and so and an hour later
[31:15] you're still reading so and so for got
[31:17] so and so you know if you don't read all
[31:20] of that you don't get a gold star that
[31:22] you read the whole
[31:24] book right
[31:27] so we read
[31:29] it but you know what after I done it
[31:31] come into the message and begin to see
[31:34] cuz I've seen a little bit back there
[31:36] what and it'd be very odd CU you're
[31:37] reading so and so we got so and so and
[31:38] so and we got so and so and and all at
[31:40] once there a jewel laying there and then
[31:42] the next verse is so and so we got so
[31:44] and so but you know you wouldn't get
[31:46] that Jewel if you didn't read the whole
[31:47] book amen so it's not trying to get a
[31:50] star in your
[31:51] cown but see that to me is the way God
[31:54] keeps our
[31:56] attention
[31:57] it's either tonight or tomorrow uh
[32:00] Sunday morning brother says and look
[32:03] said we go back to Revelations
[32:08] 3:14 and that's what I've always told
[32:10] you about Revelations
[32:12] 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the
[32:15] seventh
[32:17] angel this message will go to Israel of
[32:20] Revelation 107 but in the days of the
[32:22] voice of the seven Angel we know what's
[32:24] going to Israel right right so it's a
[32:27] beautiful book amen a wonderful
[32:30] opportunity to be able to just
[32:33] read in all amen it be like getting a
[32:36] book you know you and and you read about
[32:39] half of it in the pages is missing
[32:42] that's what it used to be
[32:45] right I want to know what the rest of it
[32:48] is right and then you might find three
[32:51] pages missing and then you might find it
[32:53] start back over the book
[32:55] well you don't know who Mary John is you
[32:58] know so you miss it but when the whole
[33:02] book unfolds
[33:04] right and the whole book is Bound By The
[33:07] Book of
[33:08] Revelations that's what I love about it
[33:11] you said no we can read these other
[33:13] things that's right you could read
[33:17] them but the wonderful part is to find
[33:19] that we can read the book of Revelations
[33:21] and see what Paul was talking about in
[33:23] Galatians right
[33:25] amen right right that we couldn't
[33:29] understand what he was talking about
[33:31] until we read the book of Revelation
[33:33] right so then it's not a horrible thing
[33:35] to look at it but it's it's just going
[33:37] through the book to see what it's
[33:38] talking about and seeing where it's
[33:43] at see we can read our in in our
[33:46] scriptural reading you know and we read
[33:48] how that the the uh well go ahead
[33:51] brother Jo just pull that up and we'll
[33:52] start from that if I don't get to I can
[33:54] finish Sunday go ahead pull number one
[33:57] one but it's just a rereading of
[33:59] Revelation 171 to 7 I think it
[34:04] is see we can read and there came one of
[34:07] the Seven Angels which had the seven vs
[34:09] we've been through the vs we know what
[34:11] they are the pledge the things that are
[34:13] going to take place and talk with me
[34:16] saying unto me come hither and I'll show
[34:18] unto thee the
[34:21] Judgment y now remember that tonight the
[34:25] Judgment of the Great that sit up
[34:27] many
[34:28] Waters judgment doesn't mean that it's
[34:33] finalized at that point are
[34:37] done there's a judgment to come to that
[34:41] church system right you know a a
[34:44] destroying right but the judgment's done
[34:47] made
[34:50] right as brother Brown said you could
[34:53] put a George Washington and Abraham
[34:55] Lincoln in every office in in the United
[34:57] States and couldn't pull it out do you
[34:58] remember that quote right amen well see
[35:01] then you could put a William bradam in
[35:04] ever denomination there is and you
[35:07] couldn't pull the thing
[35:08] out cuz they throw him out cuz they
[35:12] did
[35:14] y but you see what I'm talking about the
[35:16] Judgment set so now John is going to be
[35:19] told the
[35:21] Judgment we've looked back before seeing
[35:23] who it
[35:25] is
[35:27] now you see the Judgment of
[35:30] it what's going to be her
[35:33] condemnation look with whom the kings of
[35:36] the earth now you say boy something far
[35:40] right now the only one king I reckon
[35:43] really is there even a king over England
[35:45] no there's a
[35:46] queen there's not a king in the world
[35:48] today I don't reckon you know what I
[35:50] mean now you could go to an African
[35:53] thing and they'd be the king of a tribe
[35:54] that's the way they would call it but
[35:56] still he's not a king of a tribe I mean
[35:58] he just king of that parts right there
[36:01] because he's still under the government
[36:02] so he he he's he's not a king brother R
[36:05] said it's
[36:07] dictators dict even in the big old
[36:09] countries he said it's
[36:12] dictators because they're only for a
[36:14] short time right see they're going going
[36:17] to rule for like a three and a half year
[36:19] period of
[36:21] dictators and he said they'll all go to
[36:23] Communism we look at it today all of
[36:25] them's gone to Communism even though we
[36:27] go over there and bail them out give
[36:28] them billions and fight their Wars for
[36:31] them and what
[36:33] happens now I read yesterday in
[36:36] Afghanistan the population the people of
[36:38] Afghanistan is one of the United States
[36:45] believe they want us to get
[36:48] out think they were happier the way they
[36:50] were right what whom the kings of the
[36:53] Earth have committed fornication now
[36:55] that's not natural physical
[37:00] things that's spiritual fornication with
[37:02] the doctrines and the and the things
[37:04] right and the inhabitants of the earth
[37:06] see if you just left it with Kings you'd
[37:08] have a problem so God covers it leaving
[37:10] all the inhabitants nowhere of the Earth
[37:14] have been made drunk with the wine of
[37:15] her fornication not her alcoholic
[37:23] beverages yet they are pretty lenient
[37:26] today in the had this method this
[37:27] Presbyterian all the you
[37:29] know Catholics and all they just Dr and
[37:32] do what they want to you know but it's
[37:34] not that it's the wine of her
[37:35] fornication it's the wine of her
[37:37] Doctrine see now we
[37:42] understand see it wouldn't be all the
[37:44] nations drunk with
[37:47] wine but it's a fornication it's a
[37:49] Doctrine like I told you the other day
[37:51] then it doesn't matter to me whether
[37:52] it's Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[37:54] Pentecostal Catholic
[37:57] bramit delites lulaes any you want to
[38:00] put on the thing and mohammadan or or
[38:04] islamics or whatever all it would be
[38:07] it's trinitarian doctrines it's it's
[38:09] worship of many gods right right back to
[38:14] the old Roman
[38:15] idea see so he carried me away in the
[38:18] spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a
[38:20] woman sit up on a Scarlet colored Beast
[38:22] full of names of blasphemy we'll get
[38:23] back to that in a minute having seven
[38:25] heads and 10 horns we know who that is
[38:27] who sits on seven heels who has the the
[38:30] Kings and all of the earth and the woman
[38:32] was aray in purple and scarlet color and
[38:35] decked with gold and precious stones and
[38:37] Pearls having a golden cup in her hand
[38:40] full of Abominations and filthiness of
[38:42] her fornication what about so beautiful
[38:44] of things I said a moment ago sitting
[38:46] there today looking to see this great
[38:49] big arena to where the people are just
[38:51] gathered and waiting for the the man to
[38:54] walk

[39:04] those old buildings and to maybe to you

[39:09] look at the beauty of a building and I
[39:10] see the architectural designs and I see
[39:13] the the construction and I see the
[39:16] workmanship that went into doing it it's

[43:06] and filter of a fornication
[43:09] right it's not full of
[43:12] wine you're going to find out later if
[43:14] you if you'll read on through the
[43:15] chapter you'll find especially when we
[43:17] get back a little that she's got her
[43:20] judgment set right yeah and that's what
[43:23] I'm trying to get here to show you it's
[43:25] a judgment but look
[43:27] and upon her forehead was a name written
[43:29] mystery Babylon the great the mother of
[43:31] harlots and Abominations of the earth

[43:57] and I saw the woman
[43:58] drunken with the blood of the
[44:01] Saints and the blood of the martyrs of
[44:06] Jesus you'll find out if you'll keep on
[44:08] reading the scriptures her judgment is
[44:11] said according to what she done she
[44:14] killed the saint she's destroyed
[44:17] y y all right when I saw her I wondered
[44:21] with great admiration y mhm and the
[44:24] angel said unto me
[44:27] wherefor why
[44:29] why why is th
[44:35] Marvel and the angelist said why are you
[44:40] marbling see he's he's looking at it
[44:43] from one way John is looking at the
[44:44] beauty of everything and how wonderful
[44:46] it looks but the angel is looking at the
[44:48] rest of it he knows who it
[44:51] is he said why are you
[44:54] marveling
[44:58] yep I will tell thee The Mystery of the
[45:01] woman and the Beast that carth her which
[45:04] have the seven heads and 10
[45:07] horns then he goes on down so you read
[45:09] on through I doubt if we'll cover much
[45:11] more of the 17th chapter you read on
[45:14] down through and just
[45:18] see John admired
[45:22] y this the angel asked why did you
[45:26] admire why did you Marvel
[45:29] right cuz John didn't know the secret of
[45:32] the mystery right
[45:34] right he didn't know who that

[50:41] beauty right
[50:45] right y look the next
[50:50] one taking from the first seal paragraph
[50:53] 328

[52:00] Baptist Bible and converted them to a
[52:02] Baptist
[52:07] Faith No brother brand he know it all
[52:10] the
[52:11] time well he said he didn't know what
[52:13] the white horse rider was right right
[52:18] and I thought that when he got into the
[52:20] seal book he came out with a couple of
[52:21] statements like this he said for once in
[52:23] my life he said I wondered about you
[52:25] more religion he said but now I see
[52:28] it you know what it had him

[52:57] the the early church with just poor old
[52:59] common folks I know what you're talking
[53:01] about I can read
[53:04] too but you know this Antichrist thing
[53:07] deceived
[53:08] everybody whose names will get to it
[53:11] eventally in the scripture whose names
[53:13] that are not written in the land Book of
[53:14] Life from the foundation of the world
[53:16] are going to be deceived by this world
[53:18] system of
[53:19] church
[53:23] amen right amen
[53:26] that's why I say folks don't worry about
[53:27] getting
[53:30] deceived you already
[53:32] are weever W was serving those
[53:36] systems amen
[53:41] right Y come on read it then would you
[53:46] notice what happened was this that he
[53:47] admired her with great admiration but
[53:50] the mystery was that she drank the blood
[53:52] of the martyrs of Christ a beautiful
[53:56] Church set their deck in purple and gold
[53:59] and she had a cup in her hand of the
[54:01] filthiness of her
[54:03] fornication now can't you just see
[54:05] though people explaining
[54:09] that take off the last few words and
[54:13] right there you know just take that out
[54:15] filter this over fornication and look
[54:17] you got a beautiful system of beautiful
[54:19] woman happing the world and she's
[54:22] sitting with a Gold
[54:24] Cup
[54:25] right that's beautiful doesn't
[54:31] it but see then you got to have the rest
[54:34] of it to find out what's in that cup
[54:38] right see when John was told in that cup
[54:42] was the filter of her fornication he
[54:44] didn't think she's too beautiful
[54:48] right you know when it ever Stripes home
[54:51] to you and I right to see where that
[54:54] denomination systems and things that in
[54:56] those people and they they're people
[54:58] they're good people I love them I I you
[55:00] know there's good people in this world
[55:02] in the churches and the
[55:04] things make us ashamed of ourselves
[55:07] that's we had a lady in the Baptist
[55:08] Church back there she said I don't I
[55:11] wouldn't make my bed if I had an
[55:12] opportunity to testify to somebody about
[55:14] Jesus
[55:15] Christ and she meant
[55:19] it there's people just give their whole
[55:22] lives and all the money they got and
[55:23] everything to the church because they
[55:25] believe the church is the saving system
[55:31] right what about it
[55:38] right her beautiful doctrines now let's
[55:40] get to that after we get over to the
[55:42] other and we'll just quit on that part
[55:45] and not go to the rest of the message
[55:46] I'll take it up
[55:50] Sunday what about the beautiful
[55:52] doctrines right
[56:02] if it wasn't for the
[56:03] truth about one
[56:06] God what would we
[56:10] have
[56:13] right we'd still be drinking out of the
[56:15] same old
[56:20] cup well I I get into the message people
[56:23] with it and just see what kind of cup is
[56:25] going wrong around the
[56:29] B some beautiful cups are floating
[56:32] around you know what I mean preachers
[56:35] with great anointings and great crowds
[56:37] of thousands of thousands falling after
[56:40] them and and believing what they're
[56:44] saying but is it the same wine of
[56:48] fornication in the cup as it was that we
[56:51] used to
[56:53] have right
[56:55] come on folks that's where I stand right
[56:58] you see because I'm trying to lead a
[56:59] group of people away from that cup of
[57:01] the
[57:03] fornication
[57:05] amen but if we're not leted away from it
[57:08] we're no different than anybody else
[57:11] right right oh no no we're we're
[57:15] Brites you know I always got them in
[57:17] trouble in the Bible
[57:22] y yep what you see I'm talking
[57:28] about things wouldn't look so
[57:36] beautiful
[57:37] if we look through and saw what it
[57:40] really
[57:43] is the prophet gets over into the fourth
[57:46] seal and he speaks of
[57:51] death that he says that the angel of
[57:54] that
[57:55] that combat Beast is the only one that
[57:57] really called it death which we know
[58:00] that would be our day in the prophet's
[58:01] message
[58:03] right you know what he said about it he
[58:07] said it was death all the time
[58:11] right it didn't become death under the
[58:13] foreal it was death in the
[58:16] beginning little Deeds little doctrines
[58:18] little
[58:21] sayings was death in the beginning
[58:26] that's right it was death in the garden
[58:28] when Eve just one
[58:34] word
[58:38] de but they're good people nobody said
[58:41] word about
[58:42] that it's my brother R see people don't
[58:45] understand it he said I am
[58:47] not against organization you want that
[58:52] quote Oh no I got these quot why don't
[58:54] you read on a little bit you find
[58:56] something he's
[58:57] saying he said I'm against the
[59:01] system of organized
[59:07] religion I was listening to him the
[59:09] other night on the table he was
[59:12] saying he says Dar Methodist Baptist
[59:15] Presbyterian Pentecostals
[59:19] all with that Holy Ghost filled
[59:23] experience
[59:27] see we look back no nobody ain't got it
[59:29] but what we got in the end
[59:32] time but looking back there and he would
[59:36] talk about those people
[59:39] right he said those brothers are filled
[59:42] with the Holy Ghost
[59:44] right now you make him AAR go right
[59:46] ahead that's between you and the
[59:53] Lord which you see
[59:55] church if we just looked at the whole
[59:58] system of organized religion without
[59:59] looking at it in the basis of of of a
[1:00:02] doctrinal issue right what could you
[1:00:06] say hey do you you get what I mean by
[1:00:09] that look at it without a doctrinal
[1:00:10] issue involved
[1:00:13] right
[1:00:15] yep what would you
[1:00:19] see sure they've gone off cutting their
[1:00:21] hair painting their face and shorts and
[1:00:23] everything else and all that stuff but
[1:00:25] there's a lot of people in this world
[1:00:26] that don't do
[1:00:29] that you know I see somebody walk around
[1:00:31] in the store and I see a lady with a
[1:00:33] dress on and long hair I really want to
[1:00:35] talk to him but I just better not I
[1:00:38] guess you
[1:00:40] know there there's still a lot of women
[1:00:43] that dress right and do
[1:00:48] right see because take away the
[1:00:50] doctrinal issues what is it we're human
[1:00:53] beings yep
[1:00:55] no we got the Holy Ghost and they don't
[1:00:57] have
[1:01:04] it it might be
[1:01:06] true but you know they might have the
[1:01:08] Holy Ghost and we might not have
[1:01:11] it that might be
[1:01:13] true bless cuz there's only one way to
[1:01:17] know
[1:01:19] right right it's whether or not the
[1:01:21] spirit in you agrees with the word right
[1:01:23] keeps on ageing not agreeing when up to
[1:01:26] so far and then
[1:01:29] quit you know we could walk right over
[1:01:31] there and give that evidence
[1:01:34] tonight we can say you people here do
[1:01:37] you believe God's word to be true and
[1:01:39] they say
[1:01:44] Amen
[1:01:47] right which you see
[1:01:51] Church John admired that yep
[1:01:59] John admired that church
[1:02:05] system whatever you want to call if you
[1:02:06] want to be Technical withen and say
[1:02:08] admire the admire the organization not
[1:02:10] the system because of what I said while
[1:02:12] ago go
[1:02:16] ahead see that's why I don't throw off
[1:02:18] on those
[1:02:20] churches why throw off on them and
[1:02:22] condemn them to hell
[1:02:25] the Bible has already told you there
[1:02:27] when we reach this position here of
[1:02:30] Revelations 17 and we reading theight
[1:02:33] we've done going in the Rapture
[1:02:35] right there is no hopes of Salvation to
[1:02:39] make you a bride after Revelations
[1:02:43] 4:1 no right there's foolish virgins to
[1:02:46] be contented with
[1:02:48] yes they'll have to give their life for
[1:02:51] the gospel that they
[1:02:53] believe but no
[1:02:56] bride no dealing with salvation after
[1:02:59] the
[1:03:04] Rapture the John admired
[1:03:07] her the scripture said he
[1:03:12] marveled he looked at her the FR said
[1:03:14] with great admiration because of her
[1:03:18] beauty but then when he found out what
[1:03:21] was in that cup right yep
[1:03:27] and you know what he didn't find out
[1:03:29] what was in that cup by himself that's
[1:03:32] right and you and I didn't find out
[1:03:35] about this word by
[1:03:36] ourselves that's right amen it took God
[1:03:40] sending us a prophet to be able to break
[1:03:43] those things and then sending us a fful
[1:03:45] Ministry to tell us these
[1:03:48] things
[1:03:50] amen and why is it to people the message
[1:03:52] are afraid of the Book of Revelation
[1:03:57] why are they afraid of the seals and the
[1:03:59] things why are they afraid of Daniel 70
[1:04:01] weeks the Y we yet to know all about one
[1:04:08] God you said well why Brother D do you
[1:04:11] talk to us about it because those
[1:04:12] doctrines are right here and if they're
[1:04:15] not killed they're going to fare
[1:04:17] up well I'm trying to do one or two
[1:04:19] things either kill them or flare them up
[1:04:21] right right cuz that's all I can do I
[1:04:24] don't have any other
[1:04:27] choice at least I don't pet you on the
[1:04:29] back and tell you you're going to heaven
[1:04:30] because you believe this prophet's
[1:04:34] message when we get over to about the
[1:04:36] 19th Chapter where it
[1:04:38] says his wife has made herself
[1:04:46] ready
[1:04:48] right
[1:04:51] amen what do we get on over maybe a
[1:04:53] little bit further into some of these
[1:04:55] things that we get to talk more about
[1:04:56] the
[1:04:58] bride cuz I'm just trying to get us away
[1:05:00] from organized religion and our thoughts
[1:05:02] and our ideas and destroy those things
[1:05:06] that have an effect upon
[1:05:13] us a beautiful
[1:05:17] Church there's more Bibles in the world
[1:05:20] today than there ever been amen more
[1:05:23] Christians
[1:05:26] right what is it 1.2
[1:05:30] billion Catholics
[1:05:34] right and you know out of that there's
[1:05:36] some good
[1:05:40] people you know out of that there's a
[1:05:42] lot of them that don't believe Mary is
[1:05:46] there they're just caught in a system
[1:05:51] y well you know what you and I used to
[1:05:54] be called in a system whether you like
[1:05:57] it or not whether you ever went to
[1:05:59] church or not he was born organizational
[1:06:03] amen
[1:06:04] right no matter what we were born in a
[1:06:07] system with a man's
[1:06:09] ideas or even our own right with nine
[1:06:13] times out of 10 that's the worst
[1:06:16] thing you get somebody that won't tell
[1:06:18] you what they
[1:06:19] believe you really don't want to know
[1:06:21] what they believe how about that you
[1:06:24] don't want to know what somebody don't
[1:06:25] not somebody believes that won't tell
[1:06:27] you what they
[1:06:31] believe that's why I just go ahead and
[1:06:33] tell you what I believe then you can do
[1:06:35] you know you you can pray for me or pray
[1:06:38] with me either way you want to make it
[1:06:40] cuz I just want to tell you like it like
[1:06:42] I see it in that way to my family my
[1:06:44] kids my wife my grandkids and great
[1:06:47] grandkids I just want them to know the
[1:06:48] truth that's the reason I'm
[1:06:53] preaching is because I want my family to
[1:06:55] have an opportunity
[1:06:58] right and I want this church family to
[1:07:01] have an opportunity talking with a
[1:07:02] brother there last Sunday talking about
[1:07:05] blood relation is not what it
[1:07:09] is blood relation is not what it is
[1:07:15] no there's people that you love
[1:07:18] sometimes better than you do your own
[1:07:19] blood relationship right right sir

[1:07:59] one thought amen that's right they try
[1:08:02] to get out of here Amen in a
[1:08:08] Rapture what about it John
[1:08:14] admiring the white horse rider that's
[1:08:17] what your Prophet said did that's
[1:08:21] right and that things deceived everybody
[1:08:24] in the
[1:08:26] world Clarence Lin taught that the white
[1:08:29] horse rider was the Antichrist before
[1:08:31] brother random come along but do you
[1:08:33] think he knew what he was talking about
[1:08:35] by Revelation right no I don't think
[1:08:41] so I think he was just lucky guess or
[1:08:44] thought you know some concept that he
[1:08:46] had I saw a lot of things before I heard
[1:08:48] of this message they wound up some of
[1:08:50] them to be true but a lot of them wound
[1:08:51] up wasn't too much good what about you
[1:08:55] all
[1:08:57] right I saw the Old Testament saints
[1:09:00] were not born
[1:09:02] again until Jesus Christ died I saw that
[1:09:06] in the Baptist Church and tried to tell
[1:09:07] people about
[1:09:09] it I saw a lot of things back there some
[1:09:12] of them was true like I said some of was
[1:09:14] wrong I had to you know try doctors I
[1:09:16] had to get rid of it yes Lord but I'm
[1:09:19] just trying to get you to see a
[1:09:21] point let's don't get caught with
[1:09:23] looking at
[1:09:26] things just because they're
[1:09:34] beautiful but if you really
[1:09:40] look if you really look at an old
[1:09:43] barn with a new paint
[1:09:46] job it's
[1:09:49] beautiful
[1:09:50] right but what's under the paint
[1:10:01] see my ideas and your ideas of prophet
[1:10:04] said are not working
[1:10:05] now that's right what do you think about
[1:10:08] this brother
[1:10:13] Donnie what do you think about it I
[1:10:16] believe every word that Prophet said
[1:10:18] I've had a many of people do
[1:10:22] that you've been around a lot of people
[1:10:25] that would say that I believe everything
[1:10:26] he says but then where are they today
[1:10:34] right yet a lot of them are still
[1:10:36] religious going to churches and things
[1:10:38] cuz the 70 that left the Lord Jesus they
[1:10:40] never went back to the world right
[1:10:42] brother R said they probably went on
[1:10:47] preaching they probably went on casting
[1:10:50] out devils and things like
[1:10:52] that
[1:10:56] but see they left the truth right right
[1:11:00] what about a beautiful Church When They
[1:11:01] Carried Jesus around to it and showed
[1:11:05] him look at this look at
[1:11:08] this said it was 46
[1:11:12] years y in the building of this
[1:11:15] Temple man worked and slaved and sweated
[1:11:19] and made a beautiful beautiful place
[1:11:27] Jesus said in 3 days y it'll be
[1:11:33] destroyed they thought he's talking
[1:11:35] about the building but he wasn't he was
[1:11:36] talking about this building here
[1:11:39] right right but you know what it didn't
[1:11:42] take much over 3 days when Titus got
[1:11:44] through
[1:11:46] right
[1:11:50] y but you think about it now let me end
[1:11:53] it with a
[1:11:57] is there any way to express or
[1:12:00] understand or
[1:12:03] explain this
[1:12:06] human anatomies or whatever the words
[1:12:09] you want to use person you're looking at
[1:12:14] whatever I don't have to tell my hand to
[1:12:17] raise I don't have to go down the street
[1:12:20] pick up foot sit down foot pick up foot
[1:12:22] pick I don't have to do that right
[1:12:26] right because there's something about in
[1:12:30] there told you took me 16 years to learn
[1:12:32] to ride a bicycle but I can still do it
[1:12:34] right now you know maybe a little wobbly
[1:12:40] but can you explain the human
[1:12:45] being that's right is there anything
[1:12:48] greater than a human
[1:12:50] being building the image of God
[1:12:54] that even in his Fallen
[1:12:59] estate there's nothing like
[1:13:04] him he can go to the moon and
[1:13:10] back getting almost to the day to um
[1:13:16] almost impossible things can be done by
[1:13:22] mankind
[1:13:24] man was just telling me recently that he
[1:13:27] actually witnessed now that of his words
[1:13:31] but the fact that they had gotten
[1:13:34] mankind to a place
[1:13:36] that they told it happened in Kuwait I
[1:13:39] believe it
[1:13:41] was that they had a way of making you
[1:13:48] invisible and they could actually walk
[1:13:50] right up to a tank and drop a grenade in
[1:13:53] and they could never see him you say
[1:13:56] that's stupid brother Dale well so did
[1:13:59] so did Arville W's daddy think they
[1:14:02] stupid right yeah that's
[1:14:06] right see there's so many Supernatural
[1:14:08] things that are being done by mankind
[1:14:11] which you know my point is one thing
[1:14:12] it's coming from mankind that's right
[1:14:15] he's broken the the prophet said into
[1:14:17] God's
[1:14:18] laboratory and there's nothing
[1:14:20] impossible to the mind of man is that
[1:14:22] Genesis nothing is
[1:14:24] withholding
[1:14:26] yeah we got to put him out because L he
[1:14:30] takes of the tree of life and lives
[1:14:33] forever didn't say Eternal forever right
[1:14:36] nothing is withholding from his mind to
[1:14:38] what he can do
[1:14:41] right I'm old enough to remember the old
[1:14:43] Buck Rogers and and different movies
[1:14:45] that was made years ago of inter
[1:14:47] planetary travel and ray guns and and
[1:14:50] all kind of things they have them now
[1:14:52] mhm
[1:14:54] if you don't believe in a supernatural
[1:14:55] go home and and throw you a Biscuit in
[1:14:58] the microwave and turn it
[1:15:01] on but you better not put the cab in
[1:15:04] there go the poor old Fell's gone what's
[1:15:08] it
[1:15:11] doing so what
[1:15:13] end okay explain all of it what's it
[1:15:18] doing your Prophet said right here in
[1:15:21] this room is enough electricity to light
[1:15:25] up the whole world you realize in my
[1:15:28] hand is enough
[1:15:31] atoms to make an atam
[1:15:36] bomb the Bible says nothing is
[1:15:40] withholding from
[1:15:45] mankind what you can think of can be
[1:15:47] done I remember reading in the old comic
[1:15:50] scripts and the things and all of that
[1:15:51] that they made hover crass that could
[1:15:53] just coming up onto the ground you know
[1:15:55] and just just come up and just go up and
[1:15:57] land and World War II we lost thousands
[1:16:00] of thousands of thousands of troops
[1:16:01] having to try to come through the water
[1:16:03] to get up on the bank to wait they just
[1:16:05] rose right up went across the water and
[1:16:06] them fell are sitting over there looking
[1:16:08] see when they run into all them bombs
[1:16:10] they going to get blowed up that
[1:16:12] thing comes over just sets them
[1:16:19] down Vietnam they spray sprayed the
[1:16:22] Treet Toops landed the troops on them
[1:16:24] and let them ripel off to the
[1:16:29] ground you think that ain't a beautiful
[1:16:38] thing people like Einstein that their
[1:16:40] minds were so
[1:16:42] great where did that come
[1:16:47] from it com from the fact that there is
[1:16:49] a supernatural almighty God Eternal
[1:16:52] right amen that's
[1:16:54] right that he's allowed us to break into
[1:16:57] his laboratory and do all these great
[1:17:04] things until the world admires it
[1:17:07] looking in the paper today where're
[1:17:09] we're in a magazine let's see
[1:17:11] smithonian Institute magazine where we
[1:17:14] showing the world as a thing and it was
[1:17:18] showing by lighter colors was more
[1:17:21] educated and more sophisticated type of
[1:17:23] world and the darker color showed the
[1:17:26] the fact of lower things you know less
[1:17:29] sophisticated and the whole United
[1:17:31] States is just clear as a
[1:17:34] crystal when I talk Revelation
[1:17:40] 13 show the United States that almost
[1:17:42] the whole United States was
[1:17:45] just showing it was
[1:17:47] illuminated by intellectual
[1:17:51] understanding y
[1:17:57] what is man that t mindful of him and
[1:18:01] the son of man that I visited
[1:18:07] him a body thou H has prepared
[1:18:11] me we are his body right amen the
[1:18:14] beautiful marvelous wonderful
[1:18:21] bride
[1:18:25] I'll say this ahead of time because I'm
[1:18:26] eventually going to get through it a
[1:18:29] bride can
[1:18:31] signify just an
[1:18:35] engagement a wife can be used as that
[1:18:38] word you're not take unto the marry thy
[1:18:41] wife cuz that which is conceived in her
[1:18:42] of the Holy Ghost so we don't just flop
[1:18:49] words when John sees that bride and in
[1:18:53] Revelations
[1:18:56] 19 you don't see her with a cup of
[1:19:00] Wrath he SE her in pure wife
[1:19:05] amen
[1:19:07] amen that's what I want to get away from
[1:19:09] this talking about organized religion
[1:19:11] and get on but I want to make sure that
[1:19:13] we see this
[1:19:17] right you said yeah but we we've been in
[1:19:20] the message now 30 40 years
[1:19:26] amen how long's the message been in
[1:19:33] us right
[1:19:35] amen what's the message done for you and
[1:19:37] I made us an educated bunch of people
[1:19:39] that are really spiritual ignor
[1:19:46] remises what about it
[1:19:51] right a beautiful
[1:19:54] thing to look about the world and see
[1:19:57] the religious
[1:20:02] Society go over to the
[1:20:07] Islamic and read their what is it Quran
[1:20:11] is that the word for
[1:20:12] it and you know that talks about being
[1:20:18] good he talks of a happy Hunting Ground
[1:20:20] to go to when to die maybe you know
[1:20:22] other words and terms
[1:20:30] but but what kind of a cup do we have in
[1:20:32] our
[1:20:39] hand come on let
[1:20:42] stand take on these
[1:20:50] things where would we be if had to been
[1:20:53] for this message
[1:20:55] right that's
[1:20:58] right
[1:21:07] you would
[1:21:10] be but do we look down on the world as
[1:21:14] secondaries or pons or something below
[1:21:17] us because of what we
[1:21:21] believe we do there's something wrong
[1:21:23] with our Bel and we still got that cup
[1:21:25] of that wrath of the wine of her
[1:21:29] fornication we think we're better than
[1:21:31] somebody because of the color of our
[1:21:34] skin or because it is colored whatever
[1:21:37] you want to say that would make us
[1:21:42] better we're all
[1:21:45] human kind of odd I can give you a blood
[1:21:48] transfusion and kind of odd you can give
[1:21:50] me
[1:21:51] one
[1:21:54] there must not be any difference in us
[1:21:56] oh that serpent
[1:22:04] seed like I said the other day have we
[1:22:07] went to these other nations to try to
[1:22:09] get them away from their gods and things
[1:22:12] and brought them to our understanding
[1:22:13] and brought them to America to civilize
[1:22:16] them
[1:22:21] yeah and look what we're doing with
[1:22:26] them I reading today where that they
[1:22:28] still have in the Amazon they still have
[1:22:32] tribes and tribes and tribes of people
[1:22:34] that won't even associate with the human
[1:22:36] beings
[1:22:42] whatsoever but there even the government
[1:22:44] is even admitting now would we be better
[1:22:46] off to bring them out or leave them
[1:22:47] alone that's what they're
[1:22:49] saying I read that I thought that's
[1:22:51] amazing I went back it
[1:22:54] again if we brought him
[1:22:57] out what would we do to him right said
[1:23:01] he took a lot of the Indians and said
[1:23:03] what do we do said we brought them out
[1:23:04] and put them in in health and brought
[1:23:07] food you know clothing whatever and said
[1:23:10] made
[1:23:10] them uh
[1:23:15] clowns said because people were paying
[1:23:17] to see them dance right and perform
[1:23:21] their rituals
[1:23:25] I remember reading way back probably 40
[1:23:29] years ago or
[1:23:30] later that they went over into and I
[1:23:33] always say Africa cuz I don't I can't
[1:23:34] keep all of it
[1:23:36] straight they went to a tribe there and
[1:23:41] they found out that they all had
[1:23:43] beautiful
[1:23:45] teeth and there were no
[1:23:48] cavities whatsoever in the whole time
[1:23:54] so they gave them toothpaste and
[1:23:58] toothbrushes and taught them the hygiene
[1:24:01] part of brushing their
[1:24:04] teeth and they went back a few years
[1:24:06] later and they had to take dentist over
[1:24:09] there to doctor all of their
[1:24:13] cavities that they
[1:24:16] developed we civilized only
[1:24:20] yeah but that's part of that system I'm
[1:24:22] talking about that's
[1:24:23] beautiful looks
[1:24:26] good brother don't you want them people
[1:24:28] over have good
[1:24:29] teeth no I'd like to have theirs you
[1:24:33] want to talk a little about brother
[1:24:34] random he said that man standing out
[1:24:36] there was it two or 300 yards with his
[1:24:39] natural eye seeing where they was
[1:24:40] hitting on the Target
[1:24:44] right yeah he said man I'd love to have
[1:24:47] his eyesight he said but look at him
[1:24:49] said he walked down the street and said
[1:24:50] there like a maggot piece of meat
[1:24:52] and he said just picks it up and eats it
[1:24:55] it sure must be good for his
[1:25:00] eyes see Church let's don't forget where

[1:25:48] truth I'm sorry for that but not sorry
[1:25:51] for what I say
