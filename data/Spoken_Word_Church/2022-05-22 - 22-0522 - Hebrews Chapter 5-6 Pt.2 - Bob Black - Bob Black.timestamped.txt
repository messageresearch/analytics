[0:00] god bless you saints
[0:04] excited to be in the house of the lord
[0:06] this morning
[0:08] it's good to come to church isn't it
[0:12] that's where you can get a blessing
[0:18] let's just pray before we go into our
[0:20] study lord we're so grateful to be able
[0:21] to gather around your word this morning
[0:23] lord just we we've come expecting lord
[0:25] and we we all have different needs lord
[0:27] and we believe that we'll our needs will
[0:28] be met this morning lord and we just ask
[0:30] lord that you'll bless our brother as
[0:32] he's studying and preparing lord and
[0:33] bless the reading of our of the word as
[0:36] we study uh out the book of hebrews this
[0:38] morning bless your people we ask in your
[0:40] name
[0:42] so we
[0:44] we've been
[0:45] uh we're almost uh
[0:46] getting into hebrews chapter six but
[0:48] just to
[0:49] to recap hebrews chapter five where we
[0:51] got to
[0:52] um hebrews chapter five starts in verse
[0:55] one with for every high priest taken
[0:56] from among men as ordained from men
[0:59] in things pertaining to god that he may
[1:01] offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins
[1:04] who can have compassion on the ignorant
[1:07] and on them that are out of the way for
[1:08] that he himself also is compassed with
[1:11] infirmity and by reason hereof he all is
[1:13] for the people so also for himself to
[1:15] offer for sins
[1:17] and no man taketh this honor unto
[1:19] himself but he that is called of god as
[1:21] was aaron
[1:23] so also god glorified not himself to be
[1:26] made an high priest but he that said
[1:27] unto him thou art my son today have i
[1:29] begotten thee
[1:31] as he saith also in another place thou
[1:33] art a priest forever after the order of
[1:35] melchizedek
[1:36] who in the days of his flesh when he had
[1:38] offered a prayers and supplications with
[1:40] strong crying and tears unto him that
[1:42] was able to save him from death and was
[1:43] hurt and that he feared though he were
[1:45] son yet learned the obedience by the
[1:47] things which he suffered
[1:49] and being made perfect
[1:51] now kind of set that in your mind
[1:53] because we're talking about perfection
[1:54] this morning that's what paul's paul's
[1:56] kind of getting to is his point where
[1:58] where you start off as a baby and you're
[2:00] trying to get to perfection
[2:02] being made perfect he became the author
[2:03] of eternal salvation into all them that
[2:05] obey him
[2:07] call of god and high priest after the
[2:09] order of melchizedek
[2:11] of whom we have many things to say and
[2:12] hard to be uttered seeing ye are dull of
[2:15] hearing so he's got he's got a lot of
[2:17] stuff to say about melchizedek and about
[2:18] perfection and growth and a lot of those
[2:20] things but he's like y'all are y'all
[2:22] ready for that
[2:25] for when the time for when for the time
[2:27] you ought to be teachers you have need
[2:29] that one teach you again which be the
[2:30] first principles of the oracles of god
[2:33] and have become such as have need of
[2:34] milk and not a strong meat
[2:37] so i think that's that's an important
[2:39] principle that paul's laying out if
[2:40] you're if you're there's a there's a
[2:42] time when you when you're ready for deep
[2:44] teaching
[2:45] but if you're not ready for deep
[2:46] teaching
[2:47] sometimes it has to be rehashed and
[2:49] things have to be laid out again and
[2:51] that the principles have to be have to
[2:53] be laid out and you go through things
[2:54] that's why sometimes it's helpful to
[2:56] reiterate
[2:58] and uh sermons get preached over and
[2:59] over until we get it
[3:01] because god he's he's he's waiting on us
[3:05] he's waiting on us so that we he's
[3:06] waiting on us for us to get it
[3:09] so you start off as a little baby and we
[3:10] just kind of reviewed last time some of
[3:12] the
[3:13] some of the traits of a baby because
[3:14] paul said for everyone that uses milk is
[3:17] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[3:20] for he is obeyed
[3:21] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[3:23] because you you don't quite um have full
[3:26] clarity on a lot of things you don't
[3:28] quite know
[3:29] um
[3:30] you know there might be some places
[3:31] where the the devil can get through some
[3:33] gaps in your armor and things
[3:35] and look at look what a little baby does
[3:37] it it gets his feelings hurt easily just
[3:39] looking at the natural
[3:41] it cries a lot always wanting his way
[3:44] a little bit selfish more concerned with
[3:46] their own comfort than others can't
[3:47] express themselves well lack of
[3:49] self-control
[3:50] likes understanding
[3:52] not ready for responsibility
[3:55] now now there's a big one isn't it a a
[3:57] little baby you're not you like like the
[3:59] example that brother wade likes to use a
[4:01] lot of you're not going to put a baby in
[4:02] the car
[4:03] you're not going to put a baby driving
[4:05] an airplane
[4:06] you're not going to uh you know you're
[4:08] not going to set a little baby over
[4:10] over a church or something like that
[4:12] a little baby trips and falls often you
[4:14] know that's a a sign of maturity is when
[4:16] you're ready for responsibility
[4:19] that's why you know when a a young man
[4:21] or young lady is thinking about getting
[4:22] married and everything you want somebody
[4:24] that's responsible that
[4:26] that is thinking about thinking about
[4:28] doing things in life that
[4:29] providing for a family providing for a
[4:31] home
[4:32] um
[4:33] because
[4:34] that's what maturity means
[4:38] a little baby needs help to eat
[4:40] and can't digest table food
[4:42] so you know a little baby
[4:45] a little baby is going to have problems
[4:47] with you preaching a sermon about the
[4:48] second fold of three-fold mystery or
[4:50] trying to break down a theorem beast and
[4:53] what that is and a little babies that
[4:55] little baby needs some milk to kind of
[4:57] get started because a little baby needs
[4:59] um you think now
[5:03] we
[5:04] last time i was just talking about how
[5:05] we love little babies in the natural we
[5:07] we love little babies and a lot of times
[5:10] in the even just in the world people can
[5:12] think of babies as just kind of an
[5:14] inconvenience
[5:15] yeah and and and it can be
[5:18] it can be looked at that sometimes as
[5:20] my you know now we gotta
[5:22] we to help the little babies grow up to
[5:24] maturity and it seems like something you
[5:26] got to wait
[5:28] on them and
[5:29] the way that paul talked to the
[5:30] corinthians the corinthian church was
[5:31] full of little babies he you know he's
[5:33] like yeah y'all got to grow up in things
[5:36] but
[5:37] a little baby what a little bit baby
[5:39] needs is for the word to be broken down
[5:42] so that they can understand
[5:43] and be born again and start growing
[5:46] and so
[5:47] a lot of times you know we will come to
[5:49] church you know when an evangelist comes
[5:51] in or whatever and we'll think it's a
[5:52] big inconvenience
[5:54] but you gotta you gotta have that
[5:56] because that's what babies need
[5:58] babies need for uh you know their little
[6:00] problems in their life to be dealt with
[6:03] young people young people have problems
[6:04] that sometimes the older ones forget
[6:06] about
[6:06] the young people are going through stuff
[6:08] and this stage you know
[6:10] all sorts of spirits in the in the
[6:12] school system and stuff and and uh all
[6:15] sorts of things that kind of begin to
[6:18] fall out of the mind of
[6:20] what a mature creature a mature
[6:21] christian might be thinking about
[6:23] the seven seals opening and
[6:25] and melchizedek and all of those kind of
[6:28] things
[6:29] but little babies not quite ready for
[6:30] that yet so they need they need they
[6:33] need it presented in maybe a little
[6:35] different way
[6:36] so maybe don't think of it as an
[6:38] inconvenience
[6:39] when an evangelist comes in and preaches
[6:41] a good sermon for little babies
[6:44] now little babies we the way we grow up
[6:46] now
[6:47] we we we're trying to get trying to get
[6:49] to a place where we can eat meat because
[6:51] paul said but strong meat belongs to
[6:53] them that are full age
[6:56] in other words you're not going to be
[6:58] able to eat that that strong meat until
[7:00] you grow up a little bit like i was
[7:02] saying that i like i just i like to use
[7:05] the example of the
[7:07] the second fold of the threefold mystery
[7:09] because you know
[7:11] that's just gonna blow little babies a
[7:12] little bit you start preaching on the
[7:14] the unknown language in the seventh seal
[7:16] what was brother brown talking about
[7:17] what was he preaching about and and
[7:19] little babies not gonna be ready for
[7:20] that
[7:22] strong meat belonging to them that are
[7:24] full age even those who by reason of use
[7:26] have their senses exercised to discern
[7:27] both good and evil so it takes some time
[7:30] it takes some learning how to how
[7:32] that when you go to prayer and and lay
[7:34] god's word at his feet and god will
[7:36] answer you and how to do battle with the
[7:38] devil
[7:39] exercising exercising to discern both
[7:42] good and evil it takes some while to use
[7:45] to to to learn how to use the word and
[7:47] what what we have access to
[7:49] strong meat belonging to them their full
[7:51] age
[7:52] so i got here an example of an eagle
[7:54] eating he's he's eating that and eating
[7:57] that meat that he got
[7:59] and a college student that's come from a
[8:02] little baby
[8:03] grown up
[8:05] now you know
[8:07] a college student you know
[8:09] may not be the best example because that
[8:11] again implies that you've got to be
[8:13] intellectually smart
[8:14] you don't have to be intellectually
[8:16] smart to understand the message but what
[8:18] you do have to have is a revelation
[8:20] that's why you know i use example a lot
[8:22] of times that the the gospel is simple
[8:25] but it's so simple it's going to go my
[8:27] over it's your intellectual mind will
[8:29] always go over it you you it is so
[8:32] simple that it it god's got to reveal it
[8:34] to you so it don't come by by being real
[8:37] smart
[8:38] but it comes by being able to humble
[8:39] yourself to god's word and allow him to
[8:41] reveal it to you
[8:42] and so it comes by by by preset upon
[8:45] precept here a little there little the
[8:47] word being built up god revealing that
[8:49] to you until you come to a place
[8:51] where then
[8:53] the seals can be opened up to you
[8:55] and and it reveals your redemption story
[8:57] and the redemption story of of the
[9:00] of the bride of christ
[9:03] so that's in hebrews chapter four
[9:06] so if we need if we need word the word
[9:09] what how how sometimes we kind of get in
[9:11] our head that that uh
[9:14] that you know maybe we can start
[9:16] battling out whether whether coming to
[9:17] church and getting the word is what we
[9:19] really need to grow
[9:21] paul said our brother said in the
[9:22] message hebrew chapter four he said
[9:24] that's what's the matter with the church
[9:26] they've been taught little old pity
[9:28] sissified old lady doctrine of some sort
[9:30] run around and have soup suppers and
[9:32] card parties
[9:33] because that's what sometimes the the
[9:36] church world has made coming to church
[9:38] all these little programs and and things
[9:40] and soup suppers and and and getting
[9:41] together to to make it a social thing
[9:44] but he said he said no mother no wonder
[9:46] we got a bunch of chaos that we got
[9:49] we don't need children's programs and
[9:51] little soup suppers
[9:53] because children's programs and soup
[9:54] suppers and all that kind of stuff is
[9:56] not going to change anybody he said what
[9:57] we need is a rugged old gospel
[10:00] a man of faith with his sword hanging
[10:01] out there and challenging
[10:03] what we need today not some petty
[10:04] theology and some theory of man-made
[10:07] clique
[10:08] we need the rugged gospel priest and the
[10:11] light and the power and demonstration of
[10:12] the holy ghost
[10:14] because what's going to save the lost is
[10:15] the word of god
[10:17] what's going to cause us to grow to
[10:18] perfection the word of god that's right
[10:21] so social programs and all that kind of
[10:23] stuff is not gonna it's not gonna help
[10:25] what we need is the word of god and
[10:26] that's what church is for churches
[10:28] churches there's a lot of things a lot
[10:30] of programs and things out there that
[10:31] will help somebody that don't have any
[10:33] money or don't have don't have a place
[10:34] to live and that kind of thing but you
[10:36] come to church to feed your soul
[10:40] so paul said in hebrews chapter 6 he
[10:42] said therefore leaving the principles of
[10:44] the doctrine of christ let us go on unto
[10:46] perfection
[10:47] not laying again the foundation of
[10:49] repentance from dead works in a faithful
[10:51] god of the doctrine of baptisms and of
[10:54] laying on of hands and of resurrection
[10:55] of the dead and of eternal judgment
[10:58] so he he's saying there's a lot of
[11:00] things that you start off with as a as a
[11:02] baby as the church was getting started
[11:04] as a foundation
[11:06] that that that that are laid out as a
[11:08] foundation of your growth but but let's
[11:11] keep going on to a perfect understanding
[11:15] a perfect revelation of jesus christ
[11:18] let's go on to perfection
[11:23] so you can see the whole plan is laid
[11:24] out in the statue of a perfect man and
[11:26] because this illustrates your growth as
[11:28] a christian
[11:30] it illustrates the growth of the church
[11:32] from a foundational faith
[11:34] so he's saying repentance from dead
[11:36] works
[11:37] dead repentance from dead works where
[11:38] you just you think you're saved because
[11:40] you're coming to church and doing
[11:41] something that because you paved the
[11:43] parking lot or because you put some ties
[11:45] into the often plate repentance from
[11:47] dead work so repentance from the way
[11:49] that you used to used to do and
[11:52] as brother louise yesterday was talking
[11:53] to the young people in the little and
[11:55] the little study down there repentance
[11:57] means you you turn around and you say i
[11:59] want to change i want to change my i
[12:00] want to change my direction not just
[12:03] not just afraid apologizing for getting
[12:05] caught but you actually change your
[12:06] direction
[12:08] and of faith toward god of the doctrine
[12:10] of baptisms and of
[12:12] laying on of hands and of resurrection
[12:14] of the dead and of eternal judgment so
[12:16] now paul's laying out a lot of things
[12:18] that that are good foundational things
[12:21] that we should know and we should
[12:22] understand he's not saying let's just
[12:24] put those to the side
[12:26] you need to know how that you're saved
[12:28] by faith and not because of your works
[12:31] you need to know that how how to be
[12:33] baptized and and and what name to be
[12:35] baptized
[12:36] in
[12:38] and the formula and what peter was
[12:40] talking about and and whether the act of
[12:43] being put down in the water is what
[12:44] saves you or whether it whether it's
[12:46] your faith in christ which it is
[12:50] and of laying on of hands do you need do
[12:52] you need somebody to lay hands on you or
[12:54] do you can you just receive it right
[12:55] there in your seat or what if you're in
[12:57] a spot where you will you need somebody
[13:00] to lay hands on you is is there
[13:02] something wrong with that and see the
[13:03] pulse paul's laying out all these things
[13:05] that are just good foundational things
[13:08] that
[13:09] that it's it's important to know as a
[13:10] good foundation that we're going to
[13:12] raise from the dead there's going to be
[13:14] a resurrection of the dead and have
[13:15] eternal judgment
[13:17] that that uh
[13:18] the things that you do there's going to
[13:20] be a reckoning
[13:23] so paul saying leaving the principles of
[13:24] the doctrine of christ let us go on unto
[13:27] perfection not laying again the
[13:28] foundation of repentance from dead works
[13:30] and of faith or god
[13:32] of the doctrine of baptisms but of
[13:33] laying on of hands and of resurrection
[13:35] of the dead and of eternal judgment and
[13:37] brother brown said in the message
[13:38] indictment he said see paul wants to
[13:40] know that these things here are
[13:42] absolutely essential
[13:44] and i'm reading this quote because it's
[13:46] he's not saying that we toss these
[13:47] things aside when we go on to perfection
[13:50] but now that we've got these things
[13:52] let's keep going
[13:54] these things here are absolutely
[13:55] essential baptisms laying all of hands
[13:57] the resurrection second coming
[14:00] all these things are eternal they are
[14:02] absolutely the truth
[14:04] but once you've got these things laid
[14:06] down it's like you're you're on a
[14:08] journey
[14:09] maybe
[14:10] somebody somebody was talking to me the
[14:12] other day about how that uh
[14:14] quoting from brother dale when he used
[14:16] to preach the seals the the series to
[14:18] how that when the seals begin to open it
[14:20] reveals your journey so now think about
[14:22] that you start you start from a
[14:24] foundation
[14:26] and you start you it's like you the
[14:27] foundation is your starting block and
[14:29] you you you leave there and you and you
[14:32] and you're trying you're going on to
[14:33] perfection
[14:36] paul would illustrate as you're running
[14:38] a race and i think it's in i think it's
[14:40] in first corinthians where paul would
[14:41] say
[14:42] run the race well because
[14:44] really the one that counts in a race is
[14:46] the one that wins so
[14:48] what does it matter if you start the
[14:50] race and you fall off and you don't you
[14:52] don't get to you don't you don't cross
[14:53] the finish line like you see so many
[14:56] people that have left the message and
[14:57] things we don't wish let's start the
[14:59] start the race with the mind and the
[15:00] goal that we're going to go somewhere
[15:04] yeah so so paul says that or brother
[15:06] ryan said in hebrews chapter 6
[15:08] in that message he preached he said now
[15:10] all these things like baptisms one is
[15:13] baptized backwards one forward one in
[15:15] the name of the father son and holy
[15:16] ghost one jesus name one this way in
[15:18] that way
[15:20] and all these different little things of
[15:21] baptisms and of laying on of hands
[15:24] like he said bless god i got the gift of
[15:26] laying out of hands hallelujah you can
[15:28] get it this way
[15:30] hallelujah he said laying all that aside
[15:32] because that's dead works
[15:34] these reformations reforming
[15:37] he's speaking
[15:38] of another class
[15:41] another class of people that would come
[15:42] to perfection
[15:44] now he said let's get away from that and
[15:46] go on to perfection
[15:48] and he said and the church is still
[15:49] lingering back in those things
[15:52] that's what they were trying to do the
[15:54] early hebrew church was trying to say
[15:56] well i was baptized by mercy and i i got
[15:58] this and all these things he said now
[16:01] lay all of that aside
[16:02] leaving it behind
[16:04] but now did he say we shouldn't do it so
[16:07] you're saying those are those are
[16:08] important it's important to have that
[16:10] foundation laid
[16:13] he said baptism is laying on of hands
[16:14] and things but that isn't perfect that's
[16:16] only the carnal reform
[16:18] and that's where the churches leave off
[16:20] at today is on that carnal reform
[16:22] one of them said oh well the water the
[16:24] word baptism means this and it means
[16:26] that and they set up organizations the
[16:29] one sprinkles and one pours and the
[16:31] other one baptizes face forward the
[16:32] other backward and you know he's trying
[16:35] to illustrate what reformation it
[16:36] reformation is when you're trying to
[16:38] you're trying to change things a little
[16:39] bit so that you get you get the right
[16:41] thing what and he'll go in to talk about
[16:43] how martin luther reformed and he he got
[16:46] uh that that we need you're saved by
[16:48] justification but he still was baptism
[16:51] under the name of the father son and
[16:52] holy ghost and or under the titles of
[16:54] father son and holy ghost
[16:56] and and leaving things like going into a
[16:58] pub and smoking a pipe and and not
[17:00] understanding the sanctification and
[17:02] reform and everything but
[17:04] our goal is to come up to a perfect
[17:06] understanding
[17:08] so what is a reformer
[17:11] a reformer is one who sees a need for
[17:13] change and works to create it in spite
[17:15] of the difficulties that often arise
[17:17] from human beings natural aversion to
[17:18] change
[17:20] see paul's talking about we're coming to
[17:21] perfection
[17:23] and martin luther and john whissel and
[17:24] all those that were looking for a
[17:26] perfect for perfect understanding but
[17:29] until that came they were reformers
[17:32] who like like i was using that
[17:34] illustration that martin luther would
[17:36] had a little bit of understanding but
[17:38] yeah there was a lot of loose ends that
[17:39] needed to be patched up
[17:41] and john wesley come with a little bit
[17:42] more understanding that we that god can
[17:44] entirely sanctify your life and make you
[17:47] live a clean life
[17:48] but yet still uh had a trinitarian idea
[17:52] a perception and it was still things
[17:54] that needed to be patched up loose ends
[17:56] i mean it needed to be tied up
[17:58] so
[17:59] again we're talking about perfection now
[18:01] now now just to illustrate perfection
[18:03] versus reformation
[18:05] i i just got a little picture here that
[18:07] of a heart that this is kind of
[18:10] reformation is kind of like patching it
[18:11] up and it's still from some things that
[18:13] aren't aren't quite tidied up yet but
[18:15] perfection is when you got the the
[18:17] complete picture
[18:19] perfection is when
[18:21] perfection is this message that we've
[18:23] heard that's that ties up all the loose
[18:25] ends and paints a complete picture of
[18:27] who jesus christ is from genesis to
[18:29] revelation and see martin luther and and
[18:32] john wesley and them they didn't they
[18:33] were they were reformers so they were
[18:35] they were they were looking at it
[18:37] through a through a glass darkly without
[18:39] without a complete picture without a
[18:41] complete understanding that's why we
[18:42] needed a prophet in this day to to give
[18:44] us a complete revelation of the bible
[18:48] and brother brown said in the first seal
[18:49] he said the reformers came to reform the
[18:51] last fallen church age preceding them
[18:55] and then after the reformers come at the
[18:57] church age from where it was and it went
[18:58] back into the world then they start a
[19:00] new church age
[19:02] always done it always
[19:04] now we went through that see in other
[19:06] words they've been a catholic church
[19:07] church age of the roman catholic church
[19:09] a long-come luther a reformer he's
[19:12] called a reformer and what does he do he
[19:13] starts right out there hammering away
[19:16] and when he does he protests the church
[19:18] and the first thing you know what does
[19:20] he do he builds the same thing that he
[19:21] come to drive out of another church then
[19:24] they have another church age
[19:26] the church age is in such a mess along
[19:28] comes john wesley another reformer
[19:30] builds another church age
[19:32] get what i mean another church age is
[19:34] built up and they're all reformers
[19:36] but he said notice this last message of
[19:38] the last church age is not a reformer he
[19:41] is a prophet
[19:43] not a reformer show me where one prophet
[19:46] ever started a church age he's not a
[19:48] reformer he is a prophet
[19:50] now now again paul paul uh brother brown
[19:53] is explaining what paul's talking about
[19:55] here when he when he's speaking of
[19:56] perfection
[19:58] when paul's talking about leaving the
[20:00] principles of the doctrine of christ
[20:02] let us go on to perfection
[20:05] back to the back to the original word
[20:07] original understanding of the word where
[20:09] brother ram said in the feast of
[20:10] trumpets he said and now through the
[20:12] church ages have done the same and the
[20:14] seven seals is to reveal all the
[20:16] mysteries that was left off during that
[20:17] time because we're without prophets and
[20:20] the word
[20:21] does not come to reformers prophets amen
[20:24] we can make a decision and next year we
[20:26] can think better we got a better idea of
[20:28] it next year god can he's infinite his
[20:31] first decision
[20:32] is perfect
[20:35] nothing can move it
[20:37] i can learn more we are finite i can
[20:39] learn more you can learn more
[20:41] but god can't learn more
[20:44] that's what that's what reformation is
[20:45] when you're learning more and you're
[20:48] you're you're piecing things together
[20:50] but perfection comes by the prophet's
[20:52] message
[20:54] he is perfect to begin with and
[20:55] therefore his first decision
[20:57] rest your soul upon it
[20:59] what the bible says
[21:01] that's it
[21:05] now
[21:06] i see where
[21:08] paul's beginning to get into um
[21:11] he's beginning to get into
[21:14] not staying with the word and not going
[21:16] on to perfection
[21:18] so brother bram is in the first seal he
[21:20] said what happened when the reformer
[21:22] died
[21:23] and his message died out you organized
[21:25] it and put a bunch of rickies in there
[21:27] and started the thing right back to live
[21:28] the way you wanted to
[21:30] you didn't want to stay with the word
[21:32] instead of moving right on with the word
[21:33] they stayed right there
[21:35] and this is it
[21:37] you don't do that
[21:44] so when he says
[21:45] let us go on to perfection
[21:48] not laying again the foundation of
[21:49] repentance from dead works and of faith
[21:51] toward god
[21:53] to really understand this next little
[21:54] section of scripture i'm going to skip
[21:56] over the next few verses and go straight
[21:57] to verse 7 and 8 where he says for the
[22:00] earth which drinketh in the rain that
[22:01] cometh off the opponent and bringeth
[22:03] forth herbs and meat for them by whom it
[22:05] is dressed
[22:06] receiveth blessing from god
[22:09] but that which beareth thorns and briars
[22:11] is rejected and is nigh into cursing
[22:13] whose end is to be burned
[22:16] so perfection is like it's like a you
[22:18] plant a seed into the ground and you and
[22:20] you wait until it comes up and then you
[22:22] can see the fruit that's born
[22:24] you plant a little acorn in the ground
[22:26] and you wait and you watch and that and
[22:28] the tree grows up until it's a great big
[22:29] oak tree and then you can say well okay
[22:31] there's another acorn coming off that
[22:32] oak tree so it came up and it bore fruit
[22:36] the same thing with thorns it you you
[22:38] you plant that kind of a seed and
[22:40] eventually it's going to come up and you
[22:41] can tell oh well that that's not a wheat
[22:44] plant that's something else
[22:46] so we're growing up to a place where you
[22:48] can look back and see where you came
[22:50] from
[22:51] so you can see your story yeah
[22:55] for the earth which drink it so but see
[22:57] what what matters everything the rain's
[22:59] falling on on the just and the unjust on
[23:01] the thorns on the end and the wheat that
[23:04] every it's the it's fallen on the true
[23:06] and the false but when it comes up and
[23:09] manifest itself
[23:11] after all that time then you can tell
[23:13] what kind of seed was originally planted
[23:18] so that's where if we go back to the
[23:20] scriptures that i just skipped over and
[23:22] start to digest this
[23:24] so again set in your mind to understand
[23:26] this that we're talking about perfection
[23:28] i'm always i only have like a couple
[23:30] more minutes
[23:31] so we'll we'll continue this next time
[23:34] this but think about perfection and this
[23:36] will help you to understand this
[23:37] scripture
[23:38] where paul says and this will we do if
[23:40] god permit to go on perfect to
[23:42] perfection
[23:43] for it is impossible
[23:45] for those who are once enlightened
[23:48] and have tasted of the heavenly heavenly
[23:50] gift and were made partakers of the holy
[23:51] ghost
[23:52] and have tasted the good word of god
[23:55] and the powers of the world to come
[23:57] if they shall fall away to renew them
[23:59] again under repentance
[24:01] seeing they crucified in themselves the
[24:02] son of god afresh
[24:04] and put him to an open shame
[24:07] so paul's talking about laying a
[24:08] foundation and going on to perfection
[24:11] he's talking about
[24:14] staying with the word
[24:16] he's comparing that with the uh martin
[24:19] the word moving through martin luther's
[24:21] age and john wesley's age and azusa
[24:23] street pentecost and coming on down to
[24:25] the end time
[24:26] and what happens if you don't stay with
[24:29] the word as the word continues to move
[24:31] because we're trying to we're moving
[24:33] toward perfection is is it that's why i
[24:36] see he's so often hit on is is you can't
[24:39] live under the the message of a previous
[24:41] age it would not have worked for for
[24:44] moses
[24:45] to be preaching noah's messenger or uh
[24:48] john wesley would be preaching martin
[24:50] luther's message because the word keeps
[24:52] moving on it keeps growing and you got
[24:54] to stay with the word
[24:58] you think about verse 6 rather he says
[25:00] if they shall fall away to renew them
[25:02] again unto repentance seeing they
[25:03] crucify to themselves the son of god
[25:05] afresh and what happens what happened
[25:07] when jesus was crucified he was
[25:09] crucified
[25:10] because the word was rejected
[25:13] and see when the word is rejected
[25:15] you're turning away from the word and
[25:17] that crucifies him
[25:20] that you're killing the word because
[25:21] you're turning away for you reject it
[25:24] so if you reject it if you reject the
[25:26] word
[25:28] that jesus is going to die again
[25:32] so in verse 4 he says for it is
[25:34] impossible for those who are once
[25:35] enlightened and have tasted of the
[25:37] heavenly gift as the musicians come
[25:39] forward we'll we'll maybe stop on this
[25:41] and continue it next time and we'll make
[25:42] partakers of the holy ghost brother
[25:44] brown said in the anointed ones at the
[25:46] end time he was in the blades
[25:48] he was in the tassel he was in the shuck
[25:50] but now he's in the grain
[25:52] he said now you go back and try to live
[25:53] again what if that life took back down
[25:55] you think that left life would ever talk
[25:58] go back after that old shuck has dried
[26:00] up ever go back and live in it again
[26:03] it never does
[26:05] for it is impossible for those which
[26:07] were once enlightened
[26:08] and didn't move on with the word as it
[26:10] came to pass
[26:12] they are dead gone
[26:14] and the thorns and thistles which is
[26:16] nigh under rejection whose end is to be
[26:18] burned
[26:19] is that right
[26:20] and so we'll continue that thought next
[26:22] time
[26:23] god bless you
[26:25] [Applause]
[26:49] foreign
[27:05] you
