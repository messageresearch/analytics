[8:54] with them and and minister to them in a
[8:56] special way but we just commit all
[8:59] things to you tonight in the name of
[9:01] Jesus Christ we pray amen amen
[9:04] Luke chapter 10 it says and he said unto
[9:08] him I beheld and he said unto them I
[9:10] beheld Satan as lightning fall from
[9:13] heaven and behold I give unto you power
[9:15] to tread on serpents and scorpions and
[9:17] over all the power of the enemy are
[9:20] nothing shall by any means hurt you
[9:22] notwithstanding in this rejoice not that
[9:24] the spirits are subject unto you but
[9:26] rather rejoice because your names are
[9:28] written in heaven in that hour Jesus
[9:31] rejoiced in spirit and said I think the
[9:33] father and the old Father Lord of Heaven
[9:36] and Earth that thou has hid these things
[9:38] from the wise and prudent it has to
[9:40] revealed them unto babes even so father
[9:42] for so it seemed good in thy sight amen
[9:46] Revelation chapter 12 and it says and
[9:50] the Great Dragon was cast out that old
[9:52] serpent called the devil and Satan which
[9:53] deceiveth the whole world and he was
[9:55] cast out into the earth and his angels
[9:57] were cast out with him and I heard a
[10:00] great a loud voice saying in heaven now
[10:02] is come salvation and strength and the
[10:05] Kingdom of our God and the power of his
[10:07] Christ for the accuser of our brethren
[10:09] is cast down which accused them before
[10:11] our God day and night and they overcame
[10:14] him by the blood of the Lamb and by the
[10:16] word of their testimony and they loved
[10:18] not their lives unto the death therefore
[10:21] rejoice ye heavens that neither and ye
[10:23] that dwell in them woe to the
[10:26] inhabitants inhabiters of
[10:28] the earth and of the sea for the devil
[10:30] is come down unto you having great wrath
[10:33] because he knoweth that he hath but a
[10:36] short time Amen god bless you tonight
[10:38] you may be seated
[10:39] and don't take a look at something here
[10:45] from the message
[10:47] Satan's eatin and just want to start
[10:52] here brother Branham speaking in in
[10:56] Satan's Eden and he says now we will
[10:59] notice the earth when he took when God
[11:02] had it under control now when God had it
[11:04] under his control then then when Satan
[11:08] took over by rejecting the Word of God
[11:10] God one time had the earth under his
[11:12] control he said it in its orbit he put
[11:15] it make it work he done everything had
[11:20] it in his control and now we'll compare
[11:23] that with with that after Satan took in
[11:26] his control you know he took God six
[11:29] thousand years to establish that planet
[11:31] with good seats to bring forth
[11:32] everything after his kind everything
[11:35] must come forth of its kind all of his
[11:37] seeds were good and so it must bring
[11:40] forth after its kind God took six
[11:42] thousand years and he says and when it
[11:45] finally was made finally arrived with
[11:47] his headquarters of the earth in a
[11:48] beautiful spot Lang East of Eden called
[11:51] the Garden of Eden God made the world's
[11:52] headquarters in the Garden of Eden in
[11:54] Egypt right at the east end of the
[11:56] garden was the headquarters and then he
[12:01] says and over the whole situation he put
[12:04] his son and his son's wife over it
[12:06] that's right that's what God did he put
[12:09] them in full control they could speak to
[12:12] the winds and and which seeks to blow
[12:15] and they would speak to the trees and it
[12:17] and he would move from here to there and
[12:19] the wolf and the lion and the wolf fed
[12:22] together and the lamb laid down with
[12:23] them and there was no evil it was
[12:25] perfect peace perfect harmony everything
[12:27] in perfection and when God had it under
[12:31] his control and notice he had his world
[12:35] had all in operation he had everything
[12:41] coming everything eating bed
[12:42] Stacia nothing died nothing to be ruined
[12:45] nothing to be spoiled nothing it was
[12:46] just perfect and over at all he placed
[12:48] his beloved children his son and his
[12:50] daughter a husband and wife to control
[12:52] it God was so satisfied he rested from
[12:55] all his works at the seventh day and how
[12:57] the seventh day Sabbath for them because
[13:07] God looked over it all over and he had
[13:09] 6000 years and molding and fixing it out
[13:12] making it come into existence up to the
[13:15] mountains up making the volcanics push
[13:18] the mountains up and the things had
[13:20] taken place in the eruptions dried it
[13:22] off and fixed it the way he had at his
[13:24] beautiful place and there was nothing
[13:26] like it the great paradises of God the
[13:28] great dinosaurs and whatever more
[13:30] crawling through it I know the great
[13:32] animals no harm in them and they were
[13:34] just gentle as a little kitten and there
[13:36] was nothing no sickness no sorrow not
[13:38] one disease germ on the earth oh what a
[13:40] place the great birds sing swinging from
[13:41] tree to tree and Adam could call them by
[13:44] name and they would fly on his shoulders
[13:47] and COO to him
[13:47] oh what a wonderful place God had so you
[13:52] know I wanted to kind of a lengthy
[13:55] reading but I want to start there
[13:57] because you know when when we look at
[14:02] the plan of God you know had everything
[14:06] in perfection had it just the way he
[14:09] wanted it and you know brother Henry
[14:13] Greene had a statement he used to say
[14:16] all the time he said God started his
[14:18] church the way he wanted it he wants his
[14:20] church the way he started it and you
[14:22] know he said everything in perfection he
[14:24] said it just the way he wanted and you
[14:27] know every star and every molecule in
[14:30] the world is still following the law of
[14:33] God and you know you know you know when
[14:36] we look at things and and in the world
[14:39] today when how everything was put in
[14:42] place and you know there's God had a
[14:44] vision of what he wanted because it was
[14:46] his attributes that he expressed and
[14:48] when he put everything in in motion and
[14:51] he said in order the way he wanted he
[14:53] was absolute perfection because it was
[14:54] just
[14:55] exactly the way God had it in in his
[14:57] mind and today it still operates the
[15:00] same way you know the Sun doesn't have
[15:02] to wonder if it's going to come up in
[15:03] the morning the earth doesn't have to
[15:05] worry if it's going to rotate around you
[15:08] know we don't have to worry about any of
[15:09] these things why because there's a law
[15:11] of God we don't ever have to worry about
[15:13] are we gonna lose gravity and start
[15:15] floating in the air why because the laws
[15:17] of God are set in motion and we're still
[15:19] walking according to the laws of God so
[15:23] the thing is is I want to ask you a
[15:24] question tonight because and this is my
[15:27] whole point is if we are living if we
[15:30] get out of out of the bed and we know
[15:33] where feet are going to touch the floor
[15:34] and we're going to walk and we don't
[15:36] have to worry about floating in the air
[15:37] and we don't have to worry about having
[15:39] all of these things that you know light
[15:42] and all these other things that the Sun
[15:44] and the moon and all these different
[15:45] things in water you know all these
[15:47] things that have happened that God
[15:48] created and they still operate under the
[15:50] same laws that God set them in motion
[15:52] today do we have to worry about having
[15:55] the same things when we are children of
[15:57] God one because we are attributes of God
[16:00] so if the attributes of God are set in
[16:02] motion then you and I are set in motion
[16:04] and so the thing is is we cannot rely on
[16:07] that same power the same anointing that
[16:09] said all that emotion is upon you and I
[16:11] and so we don't have to worry about you
[16:14] know how these things are going to take
[16:16] place but because if we can just rely
[16:19] and realize what's inside of us then you
[16:21] know what we have overcome we have that
[16:23] overcoming power we have everything that
[16:25] we have need of inside of us and all we
[16:28] have to do is just rely on that you know
[16:32] brother Wade never has to go out and
[16:34] talk to the bees and ask them or you
[16:36] know y'all got to make honey and try to
[16:37] coax them into doing anything why
[16:39] because they they follow they have a
[16:41] nature of a bee and that be nature comes
[16:44] out and they go out and do everything
[16:45] and you know what you know how he knows
[16:48] that those bees are working that they do
[16:49] their thing was because he walks out
[16:51] there and he sees the evidence he sees
[16:54] the fruit of their labor well because
[16:56] that's who they are
[16:58] the honey is there and you know brothers
[17:03] and sisters we don't have to try to
[17:05] struggle and strive to be Christian
[17:08] we don't have to be struggling strong
[17:10] one because you know what it's all in
[17:12] our minds there's the problem but you
[17:14] know areas he said everything and the
[17:16] laws of God in motion everything was set
[17:19] in order and everything was perfect then
[17:23] you know what it's still the same laws
[17:25] of God and we know how Satan you know
[17:30] she become you know a little wishy-washy
[17:33] on the word you know she began to
[17:36] question God's authority what God had
[17:38] said you know she got that in her mind
[17:40] and we know how the fall took place and
[17:47] how everything came about but you know
[17:51] the thing is this God made a way that
[17:55] when when all of that took place that
[17:57] was a way back there was a way back that
[18:00] we don't you know because in the fall
[18:02] and we still live in that fallen
[18:04] condition but yet there's a way back
[18:05] that back that's been made you know the
[18:08] wicked that we have we have the
[18:09] overcoming power that we can come back
[18:12] and be where we need to be exactly the
[18:15] way God wanted us to be many people many
[18:18] people are looking back and you know
[18:20] because we look and what God has said
[18:23] what God put in in place well you know
[18:26] the laws of God never changed it and the
[18:28] thing is is there's nothing that's ever
[18:30] happened in the world even the fall
[18:32] didn't take God by surprise you know
[18:34] there's there's nothing that's ever come
[18:37] against him that's ever hindered him
[18:39] that's that's ever you know shocked him
[18:41] that stumbled him well you know what
[18:45] brothers and sisters if we are the same
[18:47] nature we're under the same power then
[18:49] why with a wife who do we allow things
[18:51] to stumble us why do we allow things to
[18:54] beset us why don't we allow things to
[18:56] hinder us why because we've been given
[18:59] this power if we if we look here Jesus
[19:03] says what you know because he says I saw
[19:06] Satan fall from heaven you know and in
[19:10] Revelation talks about you know him
[19:11] being kicked out you know he was
[19:14] defeated a long time ago when he decided
[19:16] you know I'm going to raise myself up
[19:18] and I'm gonna be like the Most High and
[19:21] you know
[19:22] I'm going to I'm going to draw a third
[19:24] of the angels to myself and I'm going to
[19:25] be like the Most High but he wasn't
[19:27] going to be the most high because he
[19:29] never could that's reason he said I'm
[19:30] gonna be like the Most High but he I'm
[19:31] going to be this way and he's animal
[19:33] raised up and he wanted to go contrary
[19:35] to God's Word and everything you tried
[19:37] to do so all he could do was just try to
[19:40] hinder the work of God and you know but
[19:43] you know even from the beginning when he
[19:45] sold it wouldn't him and Michael fought
[19:46] in heaven and you know he was casted out
[19:48] you know he was already defeated and you
[19:52] know he says that he was a defeated foe
[19:55] and yet he's still causing problems and
[19:57] you know what people are still listening
[19:59] to him and still people are still
[20:00] allowing him to work rev Rev said and
[20:08] Satan's Eden he said he said he had
[20:10] 6,000 years to God you spent 6,000 years
[20:14] to create a perfect eatin a great garden
[20:17] that he'd that he put man over he put
[20:19] man in charge of he gave him control of
[20:22] everything and you know he had dominion
[20:25] over it
[20:27] he had dominion and yet when he fell
[20:31] away you know what God didn't do away
[20:34] with him God made a way back because he
[20:36] knew that he would fall him brought him
[20:37] back and who was trying to be trying to
[20:39] bring him back the sons of God back to
[20:42] the place where they are where they
[20:43] always should have been
[20:52] it'll break me up I feel like I gotta
[20:55] throw broke another open but but you
[21:00] know here it is well we have this all of
[21:02] 6,000 years that God said everything in
[21:06] order and and just to prove to Satan you
[21:09] know he's allowed Satan to have 6,000
[21:11] years to do the exact opposite of what
[21:14] God done he spent six thousand years
[21:17] trying to pervert exactly what God
[21:20] created because in a perfect Eden and a
[21:24] perfect atmosphere having perfect power
[21:27] over everything even fail but just
[21:31] believing the word and and Adam walked
[21:34] away
[21:36] walked away from from his position and
[21:41] then everything failed and it's been in
[21:46] this in this condition and and Satan's
[21:49] had a free reign over everything for
[21:51] 6,000 years but you know he said he said
[21:55] in 6,000 years Satan's tried to take
[21:58] over everything and hinder everything
[22:00] and make it just the perfect way but you
[22:03] know in all of these 6,000 years and all
[22:05] that he's tried to do and all that he's
[22:07] done and and all of that has that has
[22:10] been this perfect
[22:11] Satan's Eden you know the one thing is
[22:14] they still can't get the bride to fall
[22:18] you know even even in all the myths
[22:21] why because Eve fell in a perfect
[22:24] condition but you know what here we are
[22:26] in an imperfect condition
[22:29] wait it's ever you know every gun every
[22:32] every weapon every every spirit every
[22:35] demon and all of hail is against the
[22:37] bride he's against the truth but your
[22:41] brother Brad said he said he's going to
[22:42] prove to Satan that this egg will be
[22:44] like the first Eve this this Eve will
[22:47] stand on the word we will stand why
[22:55] because we have the overcoming power you
[23:03] know
[23:05] you know if you have if you have the
[23:08] life of God in you you know that's the
[23:10] reason it's so important to have the new
[23:12] birth to be born again but your thing is
[23:16] if you if you're born again you know to
[23:19] realize who you are you know I was at
[23:24] Sunday morning we were at brother Josh
[23:26] Bennet's Church and brother Richie was
[23:29] preaching there and said Taylor
[23:32] everybody hello but you know there was
[23:36] some there were some people that I've
[23:37] known for many years and they go to
[23:40] church there went to church with him
[23:41] many years ago
[23:43] well you know the one brother he said he
[23:47] kept looking at me he was a song leader
[23:48] he was stand up the front we were in the
[23:50] back and he kept looking at me he kept
[23:51] trying to figure out who I was he kept
[23:54] saying you look familiar you look
[23:55] familiar well he's like some other folks
[23:57] you know they're fishing ain't great but
[24:00] when he walked out of the church he
[24:01] exactly knew who I was things so when he
[24:03] got in sight of me he knew exactly who I
[24:05] was but he was talking to this other
[24:07] brothers know me for a long time and
[24:09] this other brother and he said well I
[24:10] knew exactly who he was I think I got
[24:12] close enough to see him because he looks
[24:15] like he's dead he said you can't deny
[24:17] who he is and the other brother says
[24:20] well you know if you look at him he said
[24:22] you can't deny who he is he said but the
[24:24] other brother said if you just talk to
[24:25] him just for a few minutes you'll know
[24:27] who he is you know I didn't have to do
[24:31] that I was born I was born a Roberts
[24:35] good bad or indifferent that's who I am
[24:38] I can't change that
[24:40] but you know what I don't have to get up
[24:42] in the morning and try to comb my hair
[24:44] and have this great hairstyle why
[24:47] because it just happened
[24:50] I got a really wide part but you know I
[24:55] didn't have to do that I don't have to
[24:58] get up in the morning and practice how I
[25:00] talk I don't have to look a certain way
[25:04] this physique just happened I inherited
[25:07] it it did but you know what we're people
[25:15] look at me they know who my father is
[25:17] why because I have the genetics of my
[25:20] father and I manifest the genetics of my
[25:22] father well you know what is the same
[25:26] way with a child of God you know because
[25:29] if you have the genetic genetics of the
[25:31] child of God if you are God make
[25:33] manifest then you know what you don't
[25:35] have to struggle to be God to manifest
[25:37] God to be who God made you to be why
[25:42] because it's inside of you one because
[25:45] it's just like Jeremiah said it's like
[25:48] fire shut up in my bones brother Branham
[25:51] said a child of God can't wait to get to
[25:53] church you know what a child of God

[28:06] that's happened in her life you know
[28:07] what she's one of the happiest people in
[28:09] the whole wide world
[28:10] she got hardly anything but you know
[28:12] what she was praying one day and she
[28:14] said Lord I want a cabinet in my kitchen
[28:18] she said I had some dishes and stuff she
[28:20] said I wanted to like blue one and she's
[28:23] got pictures of it she'll show you she
[28:25] said I wanted this cabinet in my kitchen
[28:27] and she said she went to pray she went a
[28:29] thrift store and it was a light blue
[28:31] kitchen cabinet in the thrift store when
[28:34] she went in she said thank you Lord
[28:35] that's mine
[28:37] she wanted pillars to go on her couch
[28:40] and she's got pictures up she took a
[28:42] picture of them and put in an album and
[28:44] she went to a store and she found
[28:46] exactly what she was looking for and
[28:51] people and people think you know it's so
[28:53] hard it's so hard we got a struggling so
[28:55] I've know the Christian life is just as
[28:58] easy a life to live as any other kind of
[29:00] life but you know what we make it we
[29:02] allow the devil to talk us that is so
[29:04] hard to live a Christian life and
[29:06] everything is so hard and it's so
[29:08] difficult and it's so easy if we just
[29:10] rely realize what's on the inside of us
[29:13] and rely on that if we could just rely
[29:15] on
[29:16] on the life that's on the inside of us
[29:19] brother branham said that all that we
[29:21] had need of in this Christian journey
[29:23] was given to us in the new birth
[29:25] everything has been given to you you
[29:27] have been equipped for this journey for
[29:30] every bottle in every situation he said
[29:33] the only thing you've got to do is drink
[29:34] in and push out it's inside of you if
[29:37] you can realize that it's definitely on
[29:38] the inside of you you know it's such a
[29:44] great thing to understand to realize
[29:46] that we are who we are you know that
[29:48] we're children of God
[29:49] that we are God made manifest in flesh
[29:52] upon descending upon this earth you know
[29:56] it doesn't make us any any great person
[29:58] or any great thing but it's a it's a
[30:00] humbling experience to realize what God
[30:02] has done for you but you know what if we
[30:04] god has called us to this then when it's
[30:06] our it's our responsibility it's our
[30:09] responsibility to live the life that God
[30:12] called us to not to live below our
[30:14] privileges not not to live below what
[30:16] God has called us to God called us to a
[30:20] position for us to be fortified to be
[30:28] overcomers
[30:36] so we have to do what be what God has
[30:39] called us to be this is from crisis of
[30:50] mystery of God revealed brother brems
[30:52] says heavenly places oh I wish I had
[30:54] time here I've got it marked right here
[30:57] in the Bible about heavenly places what
[30:59] is heavenly places just for a moment the
[31:01] believers position in Christ see where
[31:03] the believer stands in Christ in
[31:04] heavenly places he says according as he
[31:07] has chosen us listen close listen chosen
[31:10] us in him before the foundation of the
[31:11] world when did he choose us before the
[31:13] foundation of the world when his great
[31:15] hidden mystery his great secret he chose
[31:18] us in Christ before the foundation of
[31:20] the world that we should be holy and
[31:22] without blame before him and what love
[31:25] having what predestinated us unto the
[31:27] adoption of children by Christ Jesus to
[31:30] himself according to the good pleasure
[31:32] of his will
[31:34] predestinated there's the mystery he
[31:38] before Christ or anything else was ever
[31:40] on earth you see his great mystery that
[31:43] he chose the bride knowing Eve would
[31:45] fall from disbelieving the word knowing
[31:47] that she would fall but he would choose
[31:49] a bride that would not fall that would
[31:51] hold to that word regardless of what all
[31:54] the rest of the world had to say about
[31:55] it
[31:56] they would hold to that word they are
[31:57] predestinated to stand there the
[32:00] adoption of children by Christ Jesus
[32:02] predestinated the church to that great
[32:06] glorious stand so we are called to this
[32:12] and you know as a spoke one time before
[32:15] you know to understand you know this
[32:18] great mystery that God had and you know
[32:21] the you know all the way down through
[32:23] the Old Testament and everything you
[32:25] know God was unveiling it was revealing
[32:28] himself was unveiling himself but you
[32:30] know it was a secret to people it was it
[32:33] was a secret people didn't realize what
[32:35] was taking place and he said you know
[32:38] because if like I said a sacred is
[32:41] something people people say I got a
[32:44] sacred well you ain't got a secret
[32:45] anymore you got a mystery
[32:48] as soon as soon as you begin to speak of
[32:51] it it's not a secret anymore
[32:53] a secret is something that you don't
[32:56] know and you don't know anybody knows
[32:57] anything but as soon as you begin to
[33:00] speak because that's what the Old
[33:02] Testament prophets began to do they
[33:03] began to speak about it and that become
[33:06] the mystery a mystery for what he speaks
[33:09] about the mystery that he made through
[33:10] by non-base prophets so they become a
[33:13] mystery but see the mystery is what had
[33:15] to be revealed you know because if you
[33:18] had never if you had never seen just
[33:20] like I believe was Lewis and Clark on
[33:22] their expedition you know years ago they
[33:25] had a black man with him well the
[33:26] Indians as Lewis I believe it was Lewis
[33:28] and Clark on their expedition you know
[33:30] they were going the Indians had never
[33:32] seen a black man before and when they
[33:34] walked up there and they saw that black
[33:35] man they they were so amazed by him that
[33:39] they said they took this arm and kept
[33:42] looking at him they were amazed and they
[33:44] kept rubbing on his arm trying to get
[33:46] the black off of him
[33:48] they were so amazed to realize that that
[33:52] was a black man well you know the secret
[33:55] was that there was never they never saw
[33:56] by men so that was and that was a secret
[33:59] that was never nothing ever known about
[34:01] that but the mystery become when he when
[34:04] he become visible to them and if it came
[34:07] to be known and all of a sudden then
[34:09] there was something that was so shocking
[34:11] to them that this actually existed and
[34:15] then when they began to look and check
[34:19] this man out because they were so amazed
[34:22] by it then and then they became known to
[34:25] them and so that's the way it was in the
[34:28] old testament see when when Jesus came
[34:31] in flesh when he began to speak he went
[34:33] back to the Old Testament in total he
[34:35] said good do I not fulfil look he said
[34:39] he said if you can accuse me of sin look
[34:41] and say if I don't fulfill the Old
[34:43] Testament Scriptures he said because
[34:45] they speak of me he said he said is this
[34:48] not what what I've come to do they say
[34:52] there was a lot of scriptures that was
[34:54] that was spoke of and people just talked
[34:57] over and some doubted and you know they
[35:01] had all these different
[35:02] different ideas about things how it was
[35:04] going to take place and when it become
[35:07] to take place they didn't recognize it
[35:09] why because it didn't come the way they
[35:11] expected it to but when he stepped out
[35:16] there he began to speak and then he kept
[35:17] telling them this is this is the
[35:19] fulfillment of those scriptures and you
[35:24] and I we're the same way we're the
[35:27] fulfillment of Scripture
[35:30] many times people you know brother
[35:34] Branham said one time he said well
[35:36] abroad haven't have a ministry in the
[35:38] last days they said yes they said it
[35:43] consists of apostles and prophets and
[35:45] evangelists pastors and teachers they
[35:48] said it's going on right now this is
[35:52] this is this is the bride's ministry but
[35:56] everybody thinks well you know what well
[35:58] what is its hands off because you know
[36:00] unless you're the fivefold ministry the
[36:02] bride don't have a ministry well we're
[36:04] just gonna put it on the 500 ministry
[36:05] there you go and then you got these
[36:08] people over here things like well you
[36:10] know what we stay away from the fivefold
[36:12] ministry we shy away from them but you
[36:15] know what every believer every person
[36:20] every member of the body of Christ has a
[36:23] ministry God didn't call you know as
[36:26] Paul talks about it the body you know
[36:28] there's there's a body and that has has
[36:31] a function you know you have your your
[36:35] body has a problem you know what your
[36:37] whole body knows about it I had to have
[36:41] a tooth removed a couple of weeks ago
[36:43] and they had no bone graft
[36:46] you know if somebody thought I got hit
[36:50] kind of fat cheap there but you know
[36:54] what I knew about it my whole body knew
[36:56] about it
[36:57] I had one tooth that bothered me but you
[37:00] know what it felt like my whole head
[37:01] sometimes and it bothers you know it
[37:04] bothers your whole body and you know
[37:07] it's the same way with you and I because
[37:09] you know we are where our body that
[37:11] we're a body ministry and people people
[37:14] say well you know
[37:15] what what can I do what can I do
[37:17] you know well I'm not I'm not a singer
[37:20] I'm not a song leader I'm not a preacher
[37:22] I'm not this I'm not that well you know
[37:24] the thing is is everybody has to find
[37:26] their position and you know the problem
[37:28] is as a lot of people they they question
[37:30] that but you know what they don't ever
[37:31] do they don't ever go to God and say
[37:32] what can I do they don't ever go to God
[37:35] and say Lord what is my job to do you
[37:39] know there's one thing as of this
[37:42] weekend and talking to a number of
[37:44] different people you know there's one
[37:46] thing if you can't do anything there's
[37:47] one thing I know all of you can do and
[37:49] brother Branham says we don't do enough
[37:50] of it and that's pray and you know and
[37:54] it's not just praying for our church but
[37:56] it's praying for the whole body of
[37:58] Christ because the whole body of Christ
[38:00] is needing prayer there's so many people
[38:02] that need prayer and you know the thing
[38:04] is we think we got to have money or we
[38:06] got to have talent or we got to have
[38:08] skills we got to have this or that you
[38:10] know what we need we need to set aside
[38:12] aside some time in our life just to get
[38:14] before God and pray and pray for God to
[38:16] do something in our lives and do
[38:18] something for somebody else you know
[38:21] many times if we get if we get out of
[38:23] our own way and quit thinking about all
[38:25] our problems and all the things that we
[38:27] have to deal with and start looking at
[38:29] what's doing something for somebody else
[38:31] then you know what we come to find out
[38:32] our problems ain't as big as everything
[38:34] else people said around it you know as
[38:37] brother Jewel Forney I got to see
[38:39] brother jewel Sunday afternoon you know
[38:41] wowsie wowsie whoo you know well all
[38:44] you're so bad so poor so pathetic you
[38:46] know sometimes you get around people and
[38:48] come to find out you know people are
[38:50] rejoicing and you know they're up and
[38:53] going and you know what you can do you
[38:55] don't even realize the battles that
[38:56] they're fighting and you know what they
[38:58] they got a spring in their step they got
[39:00] a joy in their heart they got a song
[39:02] they got everything and you know what in
[39:04] some people they've got some little some
[39:05] little problem and they're all the way
[39:08] down and it can't get up and you know
[39:10] they got all kinds of problems you know
[39:14] there's people you know they're climbing
[39:15] up mountains and you know what they're
[39:17] singing the victory song and they ain't
[39:19] got one kind of problem they ain't got
[39:20] one little you know a thing is standing
[39:22] in their way and some people they can't
[39:24] get over anthills
[39:32] they got all kind of little problems
[39:40] like him like sign said takes 90 gallons
[39:44] of water to baptize a person takes one
[39:47] drop of rain to keep them out of church
[39:51] [Music]
[39:57] you know people all you know some people
[40:00] they got they got to try to find excuses
[40:01] or some kind of thing they let
[40:04] everything well you know what you start
[40:05] looking at people in the scripture you
[40:08] know you know one thing that we're
[40:11] supposed to do is keep our eye on the
[40:12] word and you start looking at the people
[40:15] all the things that they went through in
[40:16] the Bible well we don't know you know
[40:22] because I wake up in the morning there
[40:23] sometimes sometimes when I'm on the roof
[40:25] and I'm working all day I feel like I've
[40:27] been in a furnace but you know what they
[40:30] were three boys actually got thrown in a
[40:31] fire ain't never been thrown in a fire
[40:36] but sometimes I feel like it but you
[40:39] know what we you know they went in and
[40:41] said you know our God's more than able
[40:43] and if we if we get killed he throws us
[40:45] in and we know you know we still won't
[40:47] bow we're still going to hold to the
[40:48] Word of God and we think about all the
[40:54] different problems that we have why
[40:56] because we don't have the necessarily
[40:58] the pressures and the things that they
[41:02] have but why because well we just
[41:05] Satan's come along where is Satan's Eden
[41:07] Satan's Rock and everybody to sleep it's
[41:11] all easy it's all easy just smooth
[41:15] sailing you know it's all just so easy
[41:22] you know there's there's a man I believe
[41:25] with Stanford University his last name's
[41:27] fog doctor fog and I thought was really
[41:31] interesting his what his last name is
[41:33] some of y'all probably know about this
[41:34] you know he he was into what they call
[41:37] persuasive studies and you know
[41:39] persuasive studies
[41:41] and here's this whole lab that's dealing
[41:43] with all this type of technology and
[41:44] it's all about phones and computers and
[41:46] all this kind of stuff and you know it's
[41:49] how how they can use psychologists and
[41:52] neuroscientists and all this and their
[41:54] whole their whole job is to make the
[41:56] digital and social media your your just
[42:02] sucks you right in its where it's your
[42:05] prison you just get bound by this thing
[42:07] and you know people think well you know
[42:09] it's it's alright you know because here
[42:12] you here you got people that have
[42:13] children that you know that are 11 12
[42:15] years old sometimes as young as six or
[42:17] eight years old and they got they get
[42:19] you know the first thing they get is a
[42:20] laptop a computer a tablet some kind of
[42:23] video game and they stay in that video
[42:25] game until they're 30 years old and when
[42:28] they get thirty years old they still
[42:29] they never accomplished nothing they
[42:31] can't do anything why because all they
[42:32] can do is live in that video world and
[42:35] live into that 3d and the virtual
[42:37] reality and they have no way can do it
[42:43] in the real world they can't function in
[42:45] the real world and that's what this
[42:47] man's his whole job was was technology
[42:49] on how to get people can addicted to
[42:52] this stuff and you know this this man
[42:54] was so good that when his students
[42:57] started Instagram and they got like some
[43:00] weird number like 800 million people on
[43:02] Instagram you know there's there's kids
[43:05] out there that that have a tablet and
[43:07] you know they they're all the time on
[43:08] their phone and you know you know they
[43:10] almost walk out into the street run into
[43:13] walls trip over stuff why because they
[43:15] can they can't get off of their phone
[43:17] they're like this all the time and you
[43:18] know some people they get up in the
[43:20] morning it's like we get a one I didn't
[43:22] I didn't get as many likes there's
[43:23] another person over here and I can't you
[43:25] know I don't know what I'm going to do
[43:26] because you know they got 800 likes on
[43:28] their picture and I didn't so I don't
[43:30] know if I won't be able to function
[43:31] today I don't even know if I'll be able
[43:32] to get out of bed you get somebody and
[43:37] it's like hey they got 895 and I got 915
[43:41] and they're like woo they're up and
[43:44] going hey you know what I beat that
[43:46] person you know what they everybody say
[43:51] piling up gold in a virtual reality
[43:53] world
[43:54] thought you can't get a job but you know
[44:01] it just sucked some right in their whole
[44:02] life revolves around this and it's all
[44:05] about instant gratification and you know
[44:07] it is and it's like you know you people
[44:10] don't know how to function in the real
[44:12] world when you try to talk to them about
[44:13] Christ you know about having eternal
[44:15] life and everything and you know this
[44:17] like well you know I pulled up the
[44:18] salvation app here and it was a little
[44:20] green box right here in the red box
[44:22] right here and it says do you accept
[44:23] Jesus as your Savior and I click the
[44:25] green bug the green yes box I'm saved
[44:35] I'm looking for them I'm looking for the
[44:37] Holy Ghost where's the Holy Ghost step
[44:40] that's the third out but everybody just
[44:45] thinks that's the way it is we just
[44:46] there we go I got it and you know what
[44:52] people and people wonder why you know
[44:54] people people are so you're so bound by
[44:57] everything why because they have no way
[44:59] of functioning to the place that you
[45:01] know what you hold wrong until you get
[45:02] what you deserve what you're desiring
[45:06] because you know it doesn't matter if it
[45:08] takes one day he takes ten years it
[45:11] takes twenty years because if God said
[45:13] if he made a way for you to if his those
[45:16] the word says for you to repent and be
[45:18] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[45:20] the remission of your sins and you shall
[45:22] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost he
[45:24] said for this promise is unto you and
[45:26] your children and to them that are far
[45:28] off even as many as the Lord our God
[45:30] shall call well if it would take one day
[45:32] he takes three and a half years he takes
[45:34] 33 years you just hold on because he's
[45:37] obligated to give you the Holy Ghost but
[45:43] the people are people who people don't
[45:44] wanna wait people don't want to search
[45:46] and they don't want to seek no they just
[45:48] want to say I believe brother Branham to
[45:50] be a prophet and I got my by my belt
[45:53] buckle and I got my books on the shelf
[45:55] and I got my app on the phone here that
[45:57] says message on it
[46:03] but you know what it takes it takes a
[46:05] dine out it takes a death and it takes
[46:08] your death
[46:09] to dine to your own thoughts your own
[46:10] feelings your own circumstances
[46:12] everything and looking right to the Word
[46:15] of God and taking what he says we don't
[46:21] want to get on the altar of God we don't
[46:24] want God to kill us why because we want
[46:26] a little bit of ourselves still alone
[46:28] you know the thing is if people want to
[46:31] looking because you know God can never
[46:33] bless a ministry if you got somebody
[46:35] that has a little bit too much of
[46:37] themselves in it who wasn't
[46:41] Spurgeon or whoever said you know God
[46:43] never turns you away empty unless you're
[46:44] full of yourself you know the thing is
[46:48] you got to be completely empty of
[46:49] yourself many people may brother I'm
[46:53] said what gets of what get some
[46:54] ministries what get ministers he said
[46:56] money women a popularity why because
[46:59] it's them getting in then in the way of
[47:02] God's work he said you've got to be
[47:04] humble you know what amazes me is when
[47:09] brother Branham said the angel of the
[47:10] Lord you know here he is he's he's
[47:12] fasting he's praying he's spending hours
[47:16] praying for people he's praying all
[47:18] night long people come to his house and
[47:21] he has prayer meeting at his house he
[47:22] said you know he tries to get us a
[47:24] little bit of sleep he goes away tries
[47:27] to hunt and fish and get a little break
[47:28] and you know what even then he's got
[47:31] brothers that are coming to him and he
[47:32] still seeing visions and he's still
[47:34] telling them things and he's going oh
[47:35] leagues and God still talking to him and
[47:37] tell me about things that need to be
[47:39] taken care of and things to take to do
[47:41] later an angel the Lord tells and said
[47:46] you need to be more sincere
[47:47] I read that all the time and you know
[47:51] what it blows my mind Lord I don't know
[47:54] how much more sincere II can you get but
[47:58] you know what brother Branham never
[47:59] brother brother never questioned the
[48:00] angel of God on this I hadn't found one
[48:02] place where he said what am I supposed
[48:05] to do have y'all ever found that if
[48:09] somebody does y'all show it to him but
[48:11] every single time I've ever seen where
[48:12] brother Brennan brings that up he says
[48:14] Lord
[48:14] let me be more humble let me be more
[48:18] sincere I don't know how much more
[48:23] sincere you can get but you know you
[48:28] know you has that mentality Lord just
[48:30] let me be more like you
[48:32] it boggles my mind and that's the way
[48:38] you and I we ought to be but let us be
[48:46] more sincere Lord let us be more like
[48:49] you let us be what we need to be because
[49:03] we have to be what he has us he wants us
[49:07] to be praise the Lord
[49:10] I got away from my notes on amen praise
[49:14] the Lord you know because you know me
[49:17] times we you get up here and you think
[49:20] well I'm oh I'm gonna say this and I
[49:22] want to say that you write everything
[49:23] down all of a sudden the Lord comes and
[49:24] you start talking about other things
[49:25] it's like well I don't we just skip all
[49:27] that you know but you I want to be what
[49:31] he wants me to be because you know I
[49:34] have you know because if we have the
[49:36] overcoming power and you know that's the
[49:41] biggest hindrance that I that Aaron
[49:43] Roberts has is Erin Roberts and I got
[49:47] more than a lot of other y'all God but
[49:53] you know I have the overcoming power to
[49:55] overcome we have the overcoming power to
[49:59] overcome to be what God has called us to
[50:02] be can we overcome God has made us and
[50:08] given us a pathway to overcome brother
[50:14] Brown says here
[50:19] he says it's by one spirit he said we're
[50:23] all baptized into one body in the domain
[50:25] of that kingdom one spirit speech or
[50:27] baptism no matter how good how bad
[50:30] whatever we're in the kingdom by Holy
[50:33] Ghost baptism see that's the only way
[50:36] you overcome it's all that is under the
[50:39] shed blood is overcomers cause you
[50:41] cannot overcome yourself it's he that
[50:43] overcome for you says you're resting how
[50:47] well I know them brother Brent them when
[50:49] I'm in there
[50:50] watch what kind of life you're living
[50:52] just look around see if it's just lived
[50:55] out of you automatically or if you have
[50:58] to strain and pull see then you're not
[51:00] doing it but you don't try to do it did
[51:03] you ever try yeah I don't he said in the
[51:06] days of Daniels time there were four
[51:07] over comers that could stand the test of
[51:10] fire and lion now we're expected to be
[51:13] tested that's a good lesson for my
[51:16] brother back there also he that cometh
[51:18] to God must first be tested tested what
[51:21] with the word that's God's test do you
[51:23] believe they see do you believe it
[51:27] concretions amen he that cometh to God
[51:30] must be tested that only shows a true
[51:32] child then see be tested and when the
[51:35] test comes on you can't overcome less
[51:37] there's a test give to you when the when
[51:40] test is given it's it's to see whether
[51:43] you can overcome or not jesus said to
[51:46] him that overcometh the test the test is
[51:48] the greatest thing that can that ever
[51:50] happen to you
[51:51] I believe it's written in the scripture
[51:53] Peter said our trials are worth more to
[51:56] us than precious gold it's a testing
[51:58] Thomas one good evidence to us that God
[52:01] is with us when we're tested for all
[52:04] children of God are tested and tried
[52:10] Jesus told us he said Jesus told us how
[52:15] to do it he overcome things however
[52:18] overcome means to stand the test that's
[52:20] right like all the old Saints did like
[52:23] Jesus did a midst of all his enemies he
[52:25] stood the test everything he was tested
[52:28] against he stood against he said in the
[52:31] very
[52:32] the very face of sickness and him being
[52:34] Messiah He healed them in the face of
[52:36] death he brought him back to life in the
[52:38] face of Calvary his own death he
[52:40] defeated by surrendering himself why by
[52:42] the word said you destroy the temple and
[52:46] I'll raise it up in three days the word
[52:48] said so see in the presence of death he
[52:51] defeated he overcome death in the
[52:53] presence of Haley defeated hell and
[52:54] overcome hell yes in the presence of the
[52:57] grave he overcome the grave whoa all by
[52:59] the word and humility oh my there's the
[53:02] real man there's the one to make your
[53:04] example see he defeated everything
[53:07] overcome it look temptation was for him
[53:10] you know what the Bible said he was
[53:12] tempted in all points like a man like we
[53:16] are yet without sin he was tempted by
[53:18] drinking he was tempted by women he was
[53:20] tempted by everything that could be
[53:21] tempted by he was tempted by everything
[53:23] that we are he was a man and yet he they
[53:26] you couldn't put a mark on him yes sir
[53:29] overcome means to recognize the devil
[53:31] and everyone is tricks a lot of people
[53:33] say there is no devil it's just the
[53:35] thought don't you believe that there's a
[53:37] real devil and he's just as real as you
[53:39] are anybody a real devil and you must
[53:41] recognize him real you must know he's a
[53:45] devil then the same time you must
[53:47] recognize him and know that he is a
[53:49] devil and he's against you then to
[53:51] overcome you must recognize that the God
[53:54] in you is greater and mightier than he
[53:57] is that the one that's in you has
[53:59] already overcome him and by His grace
[54:01] you are more than a match for him amen
[54:04] that's real overcoming when you
[54:07] recognize Amen God called us to give us
[54:13] overcoming power and he called us to
[54:15] recognize all of the powers of the enemy
[54:19] and they called us to overcome and you
[54:27] know
[54:28] I want to share one little one little
[54:30] thought with you I was reading the other
[54:33] night and I thought it was so good I put
[54:40] it in I put in my notes you know brother
[54:43] Ron was speaking on demonology he's
[54:46] talking to makes it if you know what a
[54:47] devil is he said the English word for a
[54:49] devil as a tormentor he said he come to
[54:52] torment you hey come he come to bring
[54:55] problems and oppose you and everything
[55:00] he come against you with and you know
[55:02] and that's what he come to do is to
[55:04] torment you and you wonder what did the
[55:09] what did the devil's come when they
[55:10] spoke to Jesus when Jesus come what did
[55:13] they say what did you come to torment me
[55:17] he come to torment you but you know what
[55:20] Jesus come they said the same thing so
[55:22] why did you come to torment us you know
[55:26] what because they were brother Ram said
[55:27] when a devil is subject to you he said
[55:30] he knows it he recognizes the power of
[55:34] God when when Jesus spoke to the
[55:39] disciples and Matthew 16 he said who do
[55:42] men say that I the Son of Man em they
[55:46] said well you're Elijah one of the
[55:48] prophets you know one of some some one
[55:54] of them whoever Jeremiah Ezekiel whoever
[55:57] but then Jesus said but who do you say
[56:01] that I am and Peter said thou art the
[56:05] Christ the Son of the Living God
[56:09] and he said blessed art thou simon
[56:11] barjona and for flesh and blood didn't
[56:14] reveal that to you but my father in
[56:16] heaven and he said upon this rock I'll
[56:19] build my church and the gates of Hell
[56:21] shall not prevail against it
[56:25] you know when if you look up the word
[56:28] gates I was reading I was reading this
[56:29] commentary they talk about you know the
[56:31] the gates you know does anybody really
[56:35] know what the what the word gates in
[56:37] that in that in the English translation
[56:40] meant
[56:43] it means a pathway it means a channel
[56:48] just like a gate goes through a fence
[56:51] you have to have a pathway and that's
[56:53] what a gate was forward it was a channel
[56:56] that was pushed that was there and he
[56:58] said and that that gate that pathway and
[57:02] you know there's there's many different
[57:04] ways of translating that but most of the
[57:09] time we think of gates as the power the
[57:12] authority the strength of Hale can't
[57:15] prevail against you but it also means a
[57:18] channel or a pathway well then you know
[57:21] what there's no pathway there's no way
[57:24] that the devil has tuned you oh you've
[57:27] got it he's got a punch coming to you
[57:29] he's got a way to get to you he can get
[57:33] through you and your five senses but
[57:34] according to the scripture there's not a
[57:36] pathway that he takes against you that
[57:39] he can prevail over you it also means
[57:42] that a gate one of the one of the
[57:45] translations for that also means is
[57:48] something that hinders you well you know
[57:51] you put up a gate you can't get in you
[57:55] can't you can't go fer any further than
[57:58] where the gate is you reach a pathway
[58:00] there's a gate there you know what
[58:02] there's no other way to go there's a
[58:04] gate there so the gates of Hell will
[58:07] stop you but he said he said the gates
[58:10] of Hell can't stop you it can't prevail
[58:13] it can't stop your path and the other
[58:17] way of translating that means a boundary
[58:20] if they put you in prison how do you get
[58:24] in do a gate so you know what the gates
[58:32] of hell can't prevail against you so
[58:36] whatever he tries to bind you with
[58:39] whatever you whatever the devil comes
[58:42] and puts on you that you're bound by
[58:45] then you know what he come to make the
[58:48] captives free so you know what the gates
[58:51] of hell can't bind you
[58:53] they can't oppose you
[58:57] they can't hinder you why because he
[59:00] said the the revelation of the word came
[59:03] to defeat all the powers of the enemy
[59:09] the gates of Hell cannot prevail against
[59:12] you that's what I believe that's what I
[59:18] asked that is my confession that the
[59:21] gates of hell can't stop me Amen god
[59:24] bless you tonight let's all stand I'm
[59:31] gonna sing I want to sing another little
[59:33] song I don't think we've sung this in a

[1:00:11] overcoming power to overcome all the
[1:00:14] powers of the enemy there's and there's
[1:00:16] nothing that can come against you that
[1:00:20] you're not more than a conqueror through
[1:00:23] him no longer to linger charmed by this

[1:12:18] brother Wrentham had the same things you
[1:12:20] know things similar in his life and he
[1:12:24] said he got to praying while he was in
[1:12:25] the sand and he said he stuck his hand
[1:12:27] down in the sand like this and scooped
[1:12:29] it up and they were sister Lois's
[1:12:31] wedding bands
[1:12:32] I was working one time working in a
[1:12:37] place where we done robotic welding had
[1:12:40] robots that done the welding we just had
[1:12:41] big jigs we just set them up and put the
[1:12:43] parts and robots weld and you just
[1:12:45] pulled the parts out put the parts in
[1:12:46] locked it down hit the Go button and the
[1:12:49] robots done all the way
[1:12:50] oh it's missing a jig one of the big
[1:12:53] jigs that held all the parts and we had
[1:12:55] these racks just I mean they were eight
[1:12:57] feet tall that's all the way down
[1:12:59] through part of the building had all
[1:13:01] those jigs down there are people
[1:13:03] climbing on top of those racks looking
[1:13:05] everywhere for it we had was missing one
[1:13:07] jig and they looked all over the top of
[1:13:08] them things people calmed everything
[1:13:10] they said they said it ain't over there
[1:13:12] and I turn to the wall and I started
[1:13:16] praying I said Lord you know we need to
[1:13:18] find that jig and I on the word set and
[1:13:22] I turned around and it was just like
[1:13:27] something coming out of me and I just
[1:13:29] walked to a certain rack and I climbed
[1:13:32] up on top of in it sit right in the
[1:13:33] middle
