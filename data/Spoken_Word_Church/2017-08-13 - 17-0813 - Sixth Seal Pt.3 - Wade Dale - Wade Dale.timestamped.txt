[0:58] part okay all right he just allows you
[1:01] to ride in it drop it okay dry all right
[1:06] now you should be here today have
[1:09] brother Brady insist agree with us bring
[1:11] up some baby speaking both services and
[1:16] thanks to Nate and Jaclyn for bringing
[1:19] them down and taking a backbend they're
[1:22] over drivers this week all right now we
[1:25] have went through the four seals we went
[1:29] to the fifth seal and now we're on the
[1:30] sixteen now as we said before when you
[1:35] talk about the seals everybody says well
[1:36] they're open and you know and that's it
[1:41] but being that they're open and that
[1:45] brother rented it was some greatest
[1:48] messages he'd ever preached right okay
[1:53] so when you say it never worked in this
[1:54] round before ever right all the healings
[1:58] and all this and that the other that
[2:00] happened in the prophets when bees did
[2:01] nothing compared to the opening of these
[2:03] sealed so we just read the booklet on
[2:06] chef yeah huh
[2:08] we just read the book Klingon ship while
[2:11] it broke up the profit well if they
[2:13] don't bring it to you right that book is
[2:15] still looking it's got to break to you
[2:18] just as it broke to the profits oh go
[2:22] away
[2:22] well sorry if just way then come on it's
[2:25] got to break to you yeah I'm not going
[2:28] in on William Brown revelation that's
[2:30] right I'm going in on my own revelation
[2:33] all right so the revelation of these
[2:35] seals is like me and brother Bob was
[2:36] talking last Sunday and I want to cover
[2:39] this in case somebody does I'll have a
[2:42] question this book is not these seven
[2:46] seals did not reveal the devil right
[2:52] like people think that it is they say
[2:55] this is the seventh sealed book of the
[2:56] rivet of the revealing of the devil it's
[2:58] not the probability God told us in the
[3:00] brief this is the seventh sealed book of
[3:02] what Redemption so there must be some
[3:05] redemptive property inside these seals
[3:09] because we know it does expose the
[3:11] Antichrist we know the Bible says that
[3:13] he will be revealed
[3:15] okay but what are you going to do with
[3:18] him when he is revealed because when it
[3:23] was revealed to the Prophet he saw the
[3:25] wild horse rider riding away from him
[3:28] here stands the land above him there
[3:31] goes one more correct right something
[3:32] was leaving what because in Redemption
[3:36] what caused us just have to be redeemed
[3:39] the devil this way he caused through Eve
[3:43] and Adam Adam don't believe come from
[3:46] from Satan it didn't come from guidance
[3:48] okay so because of that unbelief we've
[3:52] got to turn this thing back around to
[3:55] what the devil's done and we got to see
[3:57] that now he yelled about this so close
[4:00] to leave the seeds are very lad well
[4:02] he's here I was thinking about this
[4:06] morning you know Satan is very going
[4:10] we know that Satan is very religious he
[4:15] was more if he's been more religious
[4:17] than you've been because before the
[4:19] foundation of the world God created
[4:21] him and he was the worship angel and he
[4:24] turned away from God before there was
[4:25] even a world right did not let Satan
[4:29] fault and then he was cast down where
[4:30] gas down when the earth was made he was
[4:33] cast down into the garden properly God
[4:34] killed at that see so we're able to
[4:36] understand them I've always said this is
[4:39] what the seals mean to me it tells me
[4:41] where I come from what I'm doing here
[4:44] and where I'm doing okay because you
[4:47] know what if we know where we came from
[4:49] and if we know what we're doing here and
[4:51] we know where we're going see that
[4:53] answers all the questions there's no
[4:55] fear atoms fear was and he didn't know
[4:58] what was going to happen that when I
[5:01] don't walked up before God and God said
[5:03] what you do he said I was afraid he
[5:05] didn't know what was going to happen
[5:06] that but if we know now by the tactics
[5:11] of the devil what he's doing and that we
[5:13] can combat the devil with that with the
[5:16] opening of these sails what does it do
[5:18] it causes because remember I seem of the
[5:21] other day Jesus walked on the earth a
[5:23] human man needed to eat meat go to the
[5:25] bathroom had problems in his body but he
[5:28] was Almighty go I'm human flesh a man
[5:31] and the devil's dead camped him but
[5:34] without sandy said now with the new
[5:36] birth we're supposed to be the same way
[5:37] with the new birth we're supposed to be
[5:40] to all brother wait I got these problems
[5:41] well we all got problems
[5:42] Jesus had problem yeah man but he did
[5:46] not have to get up every morning say I'm
[5:47] god I got act like no you guys been
[5:50] doing what what woman's side thought he
[5:53] was it any lower things he saw her he's
[5:56] learning his soul he was Almighty God I
[5:58] was the creator but he learned in his
[6:00] humanity of the different things that he
[6:03] had to do and he I would say if you were
[6:07] to look at his commentary into those 29
[6:10] years that there was no nothing going on
[6:12] you know the silent year they call it he
[6:14] is a human male almost a human the
[6:16] second I don't believe he walked through
[6:19] the world and never have cut or
[6:20] brisbin's ourself and he was so human he
[6:23] need he can enter into all of our
[6:25] infirmities yes he can enter into
[6:27] every temptation we have he can enter
[6:29] into it why because he took on that in
[6:33] in his life and I was thinking though
[6:35] they were talking about angels as the
[6:38] Bible says other night the Bible even
[6:40] says that angels came to Jesus in the
[6:41] garden to watch strengthening so angels
[6:44] are there you say the strengthen it was
[6:47] strengthening the man you can't
[6:50] strengthen the soul of God he sorry
[6:52] there's no there's no I'm full and empty
[6:55] and then now hat flowing out I'm here
[6:57] you need a full a daughter you die you
[6:59] know these are gotten the baptism of
[7:01] Holy Ghost in your soul or you got to
[7:03] build in there there's no little area
[7:05] that's over here you know that burner
[7:08] burns it completely out puts that new
[7:11] nature in its what will come like the
[7:13] major cleansing with a sixth seal so
[7:15] what are you saying by the way well you
[7:17] can take the doses you can take the girl
[7:21] and said the words you can take the
[7:23] words of the seals
[7:25] now that was written by John right on
[7:29] the aisle tactics but now remember when
[7:31] the thunders were going to sound the
[7:33] revelations Tim he told you on not
[7:35] arriving right now to me to me this is
[7:41] this is me
[7:44] the world sees seven seals or six seals
[7:48] really there's no there's no opening of
[7:51] the seventh seal as far as we get
[7:53] opening something happens it opened this
[7:56] house was in heaven you know there was
[7:57] nobody there was nothing happened I mean
[7:59] all these things happen first seal we
[8:02] had one God and justification the man
[8:04] sanctification the word to clean you out
[8:05] white red black and mixed okay and now
[8:12] we come to the fifth seal which show
[8:13] that a group of people who didn't walk
[8:15] good what's reading right what's giving
[8:20] eternal life the fifth seal G this just
[8:22] you need know Jesus was actually their
[8:24] ancestors turning down and that's being
[8:26] the Messiah but God is going to give
[8:28] them eternal life for what for the
[8:29] testimony they held would you regard
[8:32] people we're Jehovah's people we just
[8:34] missed the part that when we come
[8:37] to the sixth seal through two prophets
[8:39] they're going to tell them that they
[8:41] miss the Messiah coming he could look
[8:44] this little still thinks my thoughts
[8:46] coming they're preparing I mean they're
[8:49] getting all these natural things ready
[8:51] all right they're getting there trying
[8:53] to find the Ark they're trying to find
[8:54] this or trying to find that why can put
[8:56] everything together because God said it
[8:58] you'll never erect this tabernacle I'll
[8:59] come do it but remember the Bible's
[9:02] already spoken said that the tabernacle
[9:03] is not in buildings and stoning and
[9:06] would be in a fleshly tables of your
[9:10] heart so that part they missed that's
[9:12] right that's why this is the secret part
[9:14] so to me to me the thunders is the voice
[9:18] of God when the seal breaks now when the
[9:20] seal breaks and you see that the wild
[9:23] horse riders enterprise that's not it
[9:25] that's already written I think in the
[9:29] other day we talked about this a little
[9:31] more but those seven thunders brother
[9:32] rebel they said well around that those
[9:34] seven thunders would be something so
[9:36] wonderful he said we'll have to compare
[9:38] with every scripture in the Bible now
[9:41] what one thing puts everything together
[9:45] in the Bible that one word I told you
[9:48] about they never forget Redemption
[9:56] from Genesis chapter 1 to Revelation
[9:59] chapter 22 is nothing cause all these
[10:02] thing s but it's nothing more than
[10:04] Reventon last so to compare with our
[10:07] scripture in the Bible the thunders must
[10:09] have to do with the redemption of man
[10:11] not the exposing or the revealing of the
[10:14] hell bucum okay got it all right don't
[10:19] forget that word brother Elsa don't
[10:21] cross Dimitri's and don't forget that
[10:24] word redemption why you say Genesis 1
[10:27] God created heaven earth why do you
[10:29] create heaven are for us a little yes
[10:31] right and then all the foam and all that
[10:35] horrible stuff happens bottom all the
[10:37] way through but what is the whole Bible
[10:41] everybody Old Testament at Abraham
[10:44] Kuyper addiction yes he went through
[10:47] justifications advocating the price
[10:48] that's why people we kind of look and
[10:50] see that it's not defenders is not some
[10:52] secret book yes
[10:57] not some secret tape that we have to
[10:59] find amongst women and already in the
[11:01] Bible is God compared with what there's
[11:03] one thing brother brown rice wine told
[11:05] y'all I love that future home book he
[11:07] gets up the 1964-65 and he says thank
[11:10] God that when I come to this future home
[11:13] and saw that though the cleansing of the
[11:15] earth was going to be those three stages
[11:17] justification safe occasion he saw
[11:19] taught that as a boy and I'll never
[11:22] varied from it one out ok so I feel
[11:25] believe in the book of redemption
[11:27] that's what that's called a book of
[11:28] redemption why because they still
[11:30] resisting people in that book right then
[11:32] Randa devil is not redeemable so let's
[11:37] kick him up that's right so let's take
[11:39] that fall out that this sentence that
[11:41] are six healed because remember six
[11:43] seals to probably tell this finishes
[11:45] Redemption because the Seventh Seal is
[11:47] Christ himself he's all of it together
[11:50] right right okay but six sealed brings
[11:53] us to Redemption just like the six fold
[11:54] purpose in Dane Sims week brings Israel
[11:57] three two prophets to total Redemption
[12:01] because remember they're going to be
[12:02] redeemed then they're going to die then
[12:05] they're going
[12:05] resurrection what same as us but some of
[12:08] us are not going to die the same thing
[12:09] exactly so to me the continuity of the
[12:13] whole Bible everybody's worried about
[12:16] the thunders being then listened the
[12:17] Thunder is the voice of God when that
[12:19] seal break now not when the seals read
[12:24] the seal was written 2,000 years ago by
[12:28] John the Revelator on the Isle of Patmos
[12:31] written on this paper but now remember
[12:34] Jesus preached them in Matthew 24 before
[12:38] that we're going to read that today
[12:40] we're going to try to read it we were
[12:42] already running on God the let's read
[12:45] this because now we're going to take
[12:47] this and what we've been doing is we've
[12:49] been taking the natural happening of the
[12:51] seal because there is an actual happens
[12:53] okay because it's it seals naturally
[12:56] going to happen there's going to be
[12:57] earthquakes there's going to be a total
[12:59] disruption of nature run around said but
[13:02] see what's that got to do with us if six
[13:04] seals listen if six seals finishes
[13:06] Redemption we got to be redeemed over
[13:10] that six sealed but the rapture takes
[13:14] place under the fourth seat okay so we
[13:18] got a lap back got all that bit back
[13:21] everything laps over and God remembers
[13:23] all the church ages we talked about of
[13:25] Church ages surely they drew them
[13:27] separated but brother Brown says they
[13:29] left over so they kind of do you know
[13:31] one laps over the other I'll make them
[13:35] laugh so you take these seals in the
[13:38] four silver after takes place well as we
[13:41] said before if the prophet says wrapped
[13:45] in that pleasure on the fourth seal then
[13:46] something has to happen to a group of
[13:48] people to take a body check
[13:50] yeah something has to happen because
[13:52] right in here after the resurrection
[13:54] happens the body change happens and the
[13:58] rapture happens right on this seal so we
[14:02] don't throw five and six out
[14:05] five and six is a higher form of what
[14:08] you already got probably God told us I
[14:10] believe in the visible union he said
[14:12] there's there's a higher form of
[14:14] justification there's a higher form of
[14:16] sanctification Paul said I die daily
[14:18] well now he died one time when he was
[14:22] getting Christian he died right and the
[14:25] new man came in but no wife Paul has to
[14:27] say I die daily this man the nature that
[14:33] gives you the body spirit soul and that
[14:37] spirit realm is not born again only in
[14:40] your soul are you born again and I've
[14:42] told you before this place doesn't mean
[14:44] anything we we talked about and I'm
[14:46] sorry you hear message preachers talk
[14:48] about the flesh this flesh is nothing
[14:50] more than a mechanism for what's on the
[14:53] inside your body your natural body
[14:57] cannot sin yeah brother
[15:00] it can't it was born in saying this but
[15:04] after our problem that's the reason I
[15:06] live you know bp3 bump itself telling
[15:11] that 6353 I thought man bro thank you
[15:15] then go sitting there under Sun suits me
[15:21] long long way learn what it say man this
[15:28] body though think about it hit somebody
[15:32] in the head say a child was born and
[15:35] this is the heart to deal with sickles's
[15:36] work on that black we're talking about I
[15:39] mean we're going by nature we're going
[15:41] about your nature which is in your
[15:43] memory reason conscious affection
[15:44] imagination all right
[15:47] clearly if you're born again today your
[15:49] soul is already retaining waiting for
[15:53] the redemption of the body right that's
[15:55] gorgeous character waiting the
[15:57] redemption of the body so
[16:00] - Michael me waiting whether we're dead
[16:03] - hey honey
[16:05] get him Sam you can throw me other yeah
[16:09] yeah
[16:10] hey brother Daniel this brother down he
[16:12] is I can't introduce all these people
[16:14] but you'll get to meet them we're good
[16:16] to have you with us I'm your worst
[16:17] nightmare
[16:18] okay alright yeah brings up anyway hi so
[16:21] look so we looking at the body the by
[16:23] the flesh of your body cannot send yes
[16:28] morning saying it's a product the same
[16:31] thing but what motivates my fighting to
[16:33] do what I do it's not my skeletal what
[16:37] its motivated from what's inside
[16:39] because when I was not a Christian this
[16:41] hand withhold beer this mouth will speak
[16:43] by all things right cursings and all
[16:47] that but now God didn't throw my body
[16:49] away and bring me a new body and then
[16:51] put it here and then him good here
[16:53] solely myself no he cleaned me up from
[16:56] the inside so that the motivator of the
[17:00] beer-drinkin ins of all the is gone so
[17:03] that's not least I got this man still
[17:05] can hold a beer
[17:06] I still hand you a beer I still say
[17:08] those things I used to say thank God I
[17:10] thought anymore yeah but I've always
[17:12] said this mouth is confusing when I was
[17:15] in the world I could kill you with my
[17:17] spear day don't you okay right I could
[17:20] really make you feel bad but now I hope
[17:22] that God is using it now to help people
[17:24] to forward the kingdom of God instead of
[17:28] forward in the kingdom of the devil
[17:29] alright so we see the seals and these
[17:33] seals that are not just surface written
[17:37] on a piece of paper this is what it is
[17:40] because this is a book of redemption the
[17:44] Bible is a book of redemption sure it
[17:47] exposes or reveals the wicked one i
[17:50] scripture for them the mouths and will
[17:53] be revealed but as he's been made known
[17:56] what's what's happening there's a
[17:58] separation
[18:02] because still in your nature see if you
[18:04] think about your problem is your memory
[18:06] that's my problem I remember the things
[18:09] I used today your conscious right your
[18:14] imagination more than that gives you
[18:16] imagine every reason reason your
[18:19] reasoning conscious imagination and
[18:21] affection because remember you don't
[18:23] love with your soul you love either God
[18:26] or the devil with that part right but
[18:30] you love your wife family with a goth a
[18:35] love in your soul the filial love is all
[18:39] the love for your family right you feel
[18:41] you'll love agape love it and like I
[18:44] told you before you say Adam in the
[18:46] Garden of Eden what happens in the
[18:48] garden between even the Beast agape love
[18:50] had to take over because filial love he
[18:53] would have killed her come the Bible
[18:56] says later on that the woman lay with
[18:58] the babies to the kill her in debates
[19:00] drivers the watch took over when the
[19:02] doctor loved took over inside and said
[19:04] no she's part of me follow my home she
[19:07] was literally fond of his ball team and
[19:09] you've been married 38 years but we are
[19:12] not DNA the same right right but Adam
[19:16] and Eve DNA test you took our DNA and a
[19:19] DNA to be exactly the same it be the
[19:21] same person now look that's what's going
[19:25] to happen in Redemption because the
[19:27] bulges will have a body like unto his
[19:29] glorious body your DNA is going to be
[19:32] changed
[19:33] that's why so change you'll be changed
[19:39] in a moment in 2011 ah now your features
[19:41] won't be changed right but we're going
[19:45] to have a glorified body that has been
[19:48] our atoms are going to have to be
[19:49] changed into his image when Jesus came
[19:52] back resurrected ascension come back or
[19:57] said I have to go to the Father and he
[19:58] come back he were the he was here 30 40
[20:01] days and the glorified body a man that
[20:06] was immortal right
[20:08] all that on the face of the earth for 30
[20:10] to 40 days right
[20:12] nothing harmony to eat but yeah you
[20:16] could walk through that wall right right
[20:18] there's no limitations well that's the
[20:20] body we're going to have yes right so I
[20:24] programmed these bodies can't meet Jesus
[20:26] in the form there in that doesn't mean
[20:29] the thorn it means a position because
[20:33] this comes from my mom in my day okay
[20:35] and this can't go but this can't change
[20:39] so Jesus's body was changed it wasn't
[20:41] dumped out somewhere like some people
[20:43] said he dumped the desert
[20:44] he got a new one no AJ he still had male
[20:47] friends in his hand he still has them he
[20:50] was he it was but when he resurrected it
[20:52] was all the work life okay alright so
[20:54] that was bored by flesh see our problem
[20:57] is we drive war how the flesh now that's
[21:00] our problem we glorify the flesh now no
[21:03] we don't glory in flesh for flesh and
[21:07] blood cannot inherit the kingdom of look
[21:08] about us alright
[21:09] so these seals then has to be something
[21:13] there has to be a thunder or a voice of
[21:15] glad that opens up that shows you some
[21:19] form of redemption that man has never
[21:22] seen before to me that's the seal the
[21:25] seals abduct a white horse riders Deanna
[21:27] Conner the white horse riders the excuse
[21:30] me the white righteous church that goes
[21:32] wrong and then the red is just someone
[21:35] sent them because that's fine that's
[21:38] history right I saw brother after the
[21:43] hitch the history that the mystery is
[21:45] now history the mystery has been main oh
[21:48] right
[21:49] the mysteries being made no we're saying
[21:51] is we know where he sees it and it's not
[21:55] always the wrong catheter okay you come
[21:58] here down here before you did because
[22:00] when you don't come right
[22:05] he's a church but you're not here for
[22:07] you do it leave that beast baseball but
[22:11] the still throw this a little bit of
[22:13] time is driving out that unclean spirit
[22:16] you shall have an unclean spirit number
[22:18] one you need to get rid of the line when
[22:25] you look at it this is gonna be quick I
[22:30] know you're gonna last three questions
[22:31] ready oh no that's okay that's why I
[22:33] look quick so anyway now let's finally
[22:36] read this scripture after 40 minutes so
[22:40] you get what I'm saying I know what you
[22:41] do with all of your new these seals are
[22:44] not just revealing in the Antichrist
[22:47] it's got to be I thought the Bible is
[22:49] the revelation of Jesus Christ and if
[22:51] that's the book of redemption they've
[22:53] got to be redemptive a redemptive plan
[22:56] being made known that's ready all right
[22:59] so see that van brings the Thunder gonna
[23:02] make some simple instead of everybody in
[23:03] the message making them some way out
[23:05] you're under in the cloud and and it's
[23:07] seven people and it gives you two wives
[23:10] and you just everything else that's not
[23:13] but I can compare everything we're
[23:15] talking about whatever strips from the
[23:16] Bible because I'm still in Redemption
[23:18] I'm still in the plan of redemption all
[23:22] right
[23:22] so if I stay in the plan of redemption
[23:23] then then I think they maybe we're
[23:26] headed in the right direction if we stay
[23:28] in the plan of redemption
[23:29] never leave that justification
[23:31] segregation baptism oh just bring it up
[23:33] a little high bring it up a little
[23:35] higher bring up a little high because
[23:38] truly like you said before you got
[23:44] justification when you were born again
[23:47] dropped off your fasting sanctification
[23:49] was the unclean spirit goes out of a man
[23:51] Waltzing Dry places seeking rest - none
[23:54] right
[23:55] God had entered in yet nobody in there
[23:58] yet all right but then you see the new
[24:01] man or are the new birth where what
[24:04] you're born again it's new
[24:07] all right and your nature is dead that's
[24:12] why dating if you'll if you'll see what
[24:14] I'm saying the Bible says the dead in
[24:16] Christ shall rise first this people end
[24:19] in the grave that are born-again
[24:20] Christians are not day and I hope you
[24:22] all said they're sleeping they're
[24:25] sleeping you've got to be dead in Christ
[24:29] while you're alive on this earth hey you
[24:32] gotta go ahead finally ok day after day
[24:35] but you gotta be dead in Christ here so
[24:38] the dead in Christ shall rise first
[24:41] that's right not the people that go out
[24:44] there to the grave goal they're dead if
[24:46] they're a Christian they're more alive
[24:48] now than they were when they were
[24:49] walking right right how to quit
[24:51] preaching we are to start back in
[24:52] sentence come on nice nice to know
[24:56] really all are three different and then
[24:58] yeah yeah you're right
[25:01] so the third seal is a black horse you
[25:04] said what's that got to do that's your
[25:05] old nature dying right remembers
[25:08] probably glosses you can't divorce him
[25:10] remember users can't marry if you're
[25:13] dope he's divorcing but now if your
[25:15] husband dies you're free to marry same
[25:17] way in Christ okay alright so your
[25:19] nature has to be dead the oh you and I
[25:21] brother bastard you can't just hold it
[25:23] you can't just open the closet door
[25:24] hanging him up and using when you need
[25:26] that means not dated a man if you're old
[25:29] lessman's dead you're free to marry yes
[25:32] crying right right all right so you got
[25:35] a damn nature then the fourth seal
[25:38] that's what is it what is a cogent I'm a
[25:42] beekeeper so I get all these free paints
[25:44] so I took white black red you mix them
[25:48] together because remember the fourth
[25:50] horse is a pale horse it's all these
[25:53] three mixed together right all right and
[25:56] it's a putrid color when you make white
[25:58] and red you're black you just don't have
[26:00] a name you walk up the load and you see
[26:03] this legal claim they got a name for
[26:04] every paint color in the world
[26:07] you know they don't have one below cuz
[26:10] it's pale but you taste up take the
[26:13] positive side of that that when you get
[26:16] born again what comes to you the word
[26:18] the word is born again in your soul and
[26:23] you start living it and it starts
[26:26] becoming part of you yes right so that's
[26:29] the three mixed together which is the
[26:33] Eagle anointing we went through we're
[26:35] going where the the Bible tells us that
[26:37] the combat beast which is the line Hawks
[26:40] man an eagle we get out of Ezekiel is
[26:43] the Holy Ghost in the believers there
[26:45] right that's the nature of the Holy
[26:47] Ghost inside of you
[26:48] a lion nature and ox nature of man
[26:51] nature Niko that you because you need
[26:52] that you need that fullness name of no
[26:55] other man :
[26:56] I thought you said focus now all the fun
[26:58] no boldness and this nuts not a lying
[27:02] spirit eaters like a lion spirit right
[27:05] the lion spirit then the Hawks is what
[27:07] label with you brother
[27:09] labor labor labor record an officer's
[27:12] not fast but he pulls a lot of load okay
[27:14] then you got you got to have
[27:16] intelligence because you got to get it
[27:17] up here first gotta come here burger you
[27:20] got to run it through like I said you
[27:21] got to run through this filter this is
[27:23] your holy host filter and then see
[27:25] what's going on right then you got the
[27:27] eagle anointing which is what prophetic
[27:30] the lion is about this tall well these
[27:34] diagraphs this call he can't stay a long
[27:36] way but he's powerful he ever gets close
[27:38] to you he'll kill you but you can't see
[27:40] see understand the office is a little
[27:43] taller you can see further understand
[27:46] okay alright then you got the man well
[27:49] here we are we're standing up above the
[27:51] bushes and we have enough intelligence
[27:53] to take us higher we counter it we get
[27:58] an airport alright so the intelligence
[28:00] then the eagle he goes higher than than
[28:03] any animal and he can see north south
[28:06] east and west with no limitation so
[28:08] that's why we have the in eagle
[28:10] anointing in this a
[28:11] we are all prophetic to a degree we're
[28:13] not prophets that's right we're
[28:15] prophetic people all right because why
[28:18] we can understand something that's never
[28:20] been understood before right Martin
[28:24] Luther was and John Leslie and some of
[28:26] those old teachers of the message of the
[28:28] message their message would love to be
[28:31] not sent here listening to me I'm
[28:32] nothing but he'd love to see the word
[28:35] open up where they had a real narrow
[28:38] view of the word but it didn't he gave
[28:41] the word being there right told you with
[28:44] binoculars you know you can only see a
[28:46] certain field of view right if you get a
[28:49] better set of binoculars it doesn't
[28:51] negate everything that's around you it
[28:53] just makes it we can see better so
[28:55] Martin Luther John Wesley and all those
[28:59] coming through coming along with the
[29:00] profit program
[29:01] he went up higher than anybody else but
[29:03] that doesn't mean he went up there and
[29:05] we stay down here if the age is anointed
[29:09] if the age has an eagle one morning then
[29:11] we're supposed to rise up he told us we
[29:13] were eaglets were to rise up and be able
[29:16] to what seed not see the eye but
[29:19] understand yeah see means to understand
[29:22] come Jesus said I'm going away and the
[29:26] world will watch seeming understand me
[29:28] no more but you'll see because we don't
[29:31] physically see Jesus we may see him in a
[29:33] vision who may seem in the picture but
[29:36] we physically are not standing here
[29:38] looking at the man gene all right but I
[29:41] see him by the I revelation and he's
[29:45] becoming more clear that he's not too
[29:47] under somewhere he's right here and then
[29:49] and he's just waiting on being you to
[29:51] get off and home offered up and on our
[29:53] feet you know that stuff right my
[29:58] football coach hook said he did either
[30:00] leave follow God way
[30:03] that stands into my way - let's read
[30:07] this point we have no time and I'll be
[30:10] helping to open the sixth seal now we're
[30:12] in the sixth seal now so we went to the
[30:13] four seals
[30:15] we're just finished yet we just now
[30:19] starting on the sixth seal and I put a
[30:21] little bullet points or characteristics
[30:22] so let's read it and then we'll go back
[30:23] to it and I'll be held man open the
[30:25] sixth seal handles open you know people
[30:29] know message that's close well to them
[30:30] it is yeah
[30:32] to them it's close amen if they say that
[30:34] still too close I say Amen to you now
[30:39] the hill we have opened the sixth seal
[30:40] and lo there was a great earthquake so
[30:42] we're talking about a natural event now
[30:44] let me back up just another second
[30:46] this fifth seal is happening in another
[30:49] dimension it's not happening in this
[30:51] dimension so John had to go into another
[30:54] dimension to see the souls under the
[30:56] altar right the fifth sealed you souls
[30:58] under the altar they had been killed
[31:00] under Ivan Hitler fire and that we're
[31:03] given white robes because of their
[31:06] testimony large event do that so we see
[31:08] that now we call it to the sixth seal
[31:10] now say still brings us right back here
[31:12] so these are mass this is what's going
[31:14] to happen it's just natural happenings
[31:17] on the earth that's why put nature
[31:19] cleansing them cuz remember when man
[31:22] fell in the garden what fell below it
[31:24] all nature yeah well my brother Lemmons
[31:27] wind it up
[31:28] hey these these people are picking up
[31:30] there they got to go up a little bit
[31:31] higher you go into Romans 8 the whole
[31:34] creation is groaning and waiting for
[31:37] what the manifestation of the dogs of
[31:40] the cat no the manifestation of the sons
[31:42] of noise we've got right right okay so
[31:46] now and I'll be all may open the sixth
[31:48] year there was a great earthquake
[31:49] so it became black as sackcloth of hair
[31:51] that's going to happen Monday you know

[32:11] gonna start driving okay so it's not
[32:14] gonna happen few minutes but this right
[32:15] here but now what is the cause of this
[32:18] because this is a natural occurrence but
[32:22] what happens the Sun became a sackcloth
[32:27] of hair and the moon became as blood
[32:29] we're going to have blood moons and all
[32:30] that well I'm not going into that pillow
[32:32] study definitely and the stars of heaven
[32:35] fell unto the earth
[32:36] I think another day everybody's going
[32:39] resurrected watching Russia watch

[32:42] Russia right he said good watching don't
[32:46] sit there all day and worry about Russia
[32:48] just watching let's be careful yeah okay
[32:52] I mean what can we do what can we do
[32:56] kind of silly but I'll promise you one
[33:01] thing everything that's happening in
[33:02] this natural world it's because what
[33:04] we're getting in the spiritual world the
[33:06] Bride of Christ because I'm telling you
[33:08] the bride is what God is dealing with
[33:11] right now he's not down with nobody else
[33:13] he's dealing with right that's right in
[33:15] deal if he won't listen he wants that
[33:18] honeymoon mom what if Kaitlyn and good
[33:23] to be here yeah first name Nathaniel we
[33:26] got married and then said well about
[33:27] three years from now we'll have any
[33:29] money
[33:29] oh my please mom quit please
[33:34] hey Rob wouldn't I mean let's go natural
[33:37] after up with it well Jesus Christ has
[33:39] waited 2000 years to have his honeymoon
[33:42] with this bride like he's always wanted
[33:44] and he's going to get and we're writing
[33:48] to throw up
[33:49] I mean rise the door we've already had a
[33:52] ceremony we're born again down here
[33:55] we're his lover where it is where his
[33:57] bride amen
[33:58] but he wants to consummate even with us
[34:00] go honeymoon we're consummated down here
[34:01] but he must go on that honeymoon of rest
[34:04] idea and the stars of heaven fell unto
[34:06] the earth even with the fig tree casteth
[34:08] her untimely figs when shaken
[34:10] mighty wind and the heaven departed as a
[34:12] scroll rolled together they were mouth
[34:14] and Island were moved out of their
[34:15] places and the kings of the earth now
[34:19] what I was telling you before this is
[34:21] not just going to happen to Israel we
[34:22] know through to prophets they're going
[34:24] to preach a message to redeem 144,000
[34:27] people that's what the vol said in
[34:28] Revelation to believe 7 or 12 we'll read
[34:31] it come up next Sunday we can't read
[34:33] this dunya and the kings of the earth so
[34:35] what happened is these two problems are
[34:36] not just calm down judgment on Israel
[34:39] because we got to remember type it back
[34:43] with Israel in the Old Testament I'm
[34:44] reading in Exodus now all of the plagues
[34:47] happened to Egypt and Israel is in
[34:50] Goshen when they will darkness so dark
[34:52] where you couldn't see in front of your
[34:53] face the Bible says it was lightened
[34:55] ocean what a lot a bunch of Egyptians
[34:56] standing there looking out over a
[34:57] complete dark not to be able to see
[35:00] nothing but a little bit alive back
[35:02] about 20 miles from from Egypt out there
[35:05] in the desert and they look like they've
[35:07] got a be my life you know coming up well
[35:09] got the scariest people me told of me
[35:12] would go to the ocean okay Kerry but the
[35:15] kings of the earth what I'm telling you
[35:16] is this whole world is going to be
[35:17] turned upside down because we're going
[35:21] to talk next on you about the spiritual
[35:23] part because when you got warning in
[35:25] your world turned upside that right well
[35:27] I started working on your nature your
[35:29] nature cleansing right in the kings of
[35:32] the earth and great man the rich man
[35:34] chief captain mighty man every bondman
[35:36] and every free man
[35:37] not living their money out his
[35:39] themselves in the dens and in the rocks
[35:41] of the mountains consider the mountains
[35:42] in the rocks fall on us and hide us from
[35:44] the face of him that sitteth on the
[35:46] throne and from the wrath of the lamb
[35:48] for the great day of wrath has come who
[35:50] shall be able to stand now let's go to
[36:08] tell you what when I went to next week
[36:10] there's not time at all to do this but
[36:12] let's go to math you can read it because
[36:14] we know that that Jesus himself preached
[36:17] the seals right Matthew 24 alright so we
[36:22] covered every one of those because why
[36:23] Jesus without the pardon and Jesus tells
[36:26] them know that they're getting excited
[36:29] to the temple it won't be once no less
[36:32] than another they asked him probably
[36:35] three things once y'all sound like
[36:38] coming into the world
[36:40] Tuesday all right jesus said 'take heed
[36:42] no man deceive you so he starts telling
[36:44] them the seal so all these are the seal
[36:46] in here we've already read them and I
[36:48] want time to go back rhythm here all
[36:51] right
[36:58] then shall they deliver you up to be
[36:59] afflicted and shall kill you and you
[37:01] should be hated of all nations from
[37:02] remain safe then shall many be offended
[37:04] and shall betray one another and shall
[37:05] hate one another don't you see that
[37:06] happening now and many more prophets
[37:09] shall rise and shall deceive many you
[37:11] see that definitely hasn't run now
[37:12] because iniquity shall abound the love
[37:14] of many shall wax cold I'll like this
[37:17] right here but he that shall endure unto
[37:18] the end the same shall be saved and you
[37:21] keep seeing all this you let them see my
[37:23] watch he's talking about Israel right
[37:28] but then shall be Great Tribulation such
[37:30] as was not since the beginning the world
[37:31] to this time where she'll been except
[37:33] those days shall be shortened it should
[37:34] be less safe trying to run out of time
[37:37] then any man shall say lo here is Christ
[37:39] believe it not the watch you throw out
[37:43] the son of man immediately I was a
[37:44] tribulation of those days shall the Sun
[37:46] be darkened the moon shall not give her
[37:47] light we just present restores your fall
[37:49] from heaven relations with this river
[37:52] blessing and the powers of the heavens
[37:54] shall be shaken then shall appear the
[37:56] sign of the Son of man in heaven see we
[37:58] see the signs on man here we see it here
[38:01] but silence no man guarding human flesh
[38:03] is going to be shown left then shall all
[38:05] the tribes of the earth mourn and they
[38:07] shall see the Son of man coming in the
[38:08] clouds of heaven with power and great
[38:09] glory
[38:10] but that denomination will God Comey
[38:12] said I'll be glad when Jesus coke down
[38:14] through the skies and split the eastern
[38:16] skies and we see them coming up when
[38:18] that happens you've already missed the
[38:20] restroom so this is after the rapture
[38:22] basically all right it just when
[38:24] everybody seeking I thought about doing
[38:25] the secret catching one and he shall
[38:28] send His angels a great sound of a
[38:30] trumpet that shall gather together the
[38:31] elect from the four winds from one end
[38:32] of heaven to the other and then he
[38:34] starts talking about Israel which is
[38:36] always the fig tree so now next Sunday
[38:39] will read revelation where the two
[38:43] prophets come in so you got two prophets
[38:45] there's a nature cleansing for remember
[38:48] I read in Romans 8 that the whole
[38:51] creation groaneth and travaileth wing or
[38:53] what macrophages from the gun but now
[38:56] there's another thing that I want to
[38:57] show you if the spoken word through two
[39:02] prophets
[39:04] they don't just read they don't you read
[39:09] well it says it that there's supposed to
[39:12] be an earthquake so let's talk about her
[39:15] place today hey Moses hey Elijah with
[39:19] one with what no they know exactly what
[39:21] to do when he's in here they are versed
[39:23] in the scripture and they have the
[39:24] spirit of Moses and Elijah upon them and
[39:26] they're going to speak the word and it's
[39:28] going to happen but I'll promise you one
[39:30] thing before we leave this earth that
[39:33] spoken word is going to happen right
[39:34] here hey
[39:38] [Music]
