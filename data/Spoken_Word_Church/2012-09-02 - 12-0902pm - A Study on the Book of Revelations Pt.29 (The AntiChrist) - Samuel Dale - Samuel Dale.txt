Heart oh my heart I wanna see you thank you foreign want to see no teeth when we served all of our life is now here ready we'll just received if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn where we've

we can make arrangements for transportation and things and just if the Lord would bless also remember that uh waiting now next weekend or this coming Saturday will be going up to have a ministers meeting with some brothers about Daniel 70 weeks and the we pray for the right attitude in the right way of presenting everything that the Lord would be with us and guide us and take care of us so remember that right uh talk to brother Danny just a little bit ago talk to him this morning he was on the way toward the hospital but I didn't know the whole story and he put it all together for me he went to Gainesville and they were getting ready to operate you know they wanted to do that immediately and he told him no he was going to his doctors in Athens we went to Athens and a doctor and Athens said I don't say they didn't even mention operating or anything because when he got down there said they they said well I think that it can be treated and everything will be all right so we just believe it right now they wanted to operate and get everything and get them like an ultrasound or something and go right in and operate but the Lord knows how to take care of everything and sometimes he may have to send us around by another doctor to get everything to set up but he knows how to do it so just keep praying for Danny said he was going home you know like Adam just remember him in your prayers okay let's pray before we read our scripture father we thank you for your love and your grace we thank you for you and we thank you for all that you've given unto us and we pray that you would just bless us now with your presence and understanding forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and keep us Lord in thy Grace thank you for being with brother Danny so just bring him on out of this Lord and make all things well because we thank you for it and we pray that you'd bless each one be with those that are not hearing but just remember each one member sister Gene's husband George their lord you just bless him he's sick and many sicknesses Among Us and you just have your way we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 1-3 the revelation of Jesus Christ was God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass any sin and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand what the time to understand is at hand now First Peter 1 9 receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls of which salvation of the prophets have inquired in church diligently who profits out of the grace that should come unto you searching what or what manner of time the spirit of Christ which is in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did Minister the things which are now recorded unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the Angels desire to look into look what he concludes it wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now we've got through covered basically chapter 5 and all and now we're going to a little bit we read Revelation 6 1 and then we'll start in our thoughts but you know the main thing I'm wanting you to see is like I've tried to emphasize over and over that the actual seal itself are the manifestation maybe as a way of saying it of those things under the seals will transpire after we leave out of here we have already be in the Rapture we'll already be in glory while that is taking place upon the Earth all right see in doing that then we look back like we were talking this morning that actually the seals broke back there to over 2 000 years ago because Jesus actually preached them in the scriptures of Matthew 24. he breathed six of us the yields and placed it there in the scripture all right then John goes to Patmos and what does he see he sees what Jesus preached amen but he can only get it as it's revealed to it and we'll cover this in a minute then he'll get it in a symbol form all right in that symbol form was to last until the end time when God would send us a prophet to be able to understand the symbols of the Bible and then he could break those things to the prophet or reveal it to him because it's already broken I keep emphasizing that people they're arguing now among the message people that six of the seals are broke and and the sale it's not broke yet all right then others pick it up and say that the Sabbath is not revealed yet you know it's just one thing after another of mankind trying to figure out those things but the Bible says it's open well then at least at least we should agree with that part right so it comes in Revelation 8 1 it says you know in the opening the seventh seal all right it has to be opened or John would not have been able to spoke about it nmc bringing it to us as a church symbol and we even read there to last this morning that Lorena said we're seeing here tonight on the seventh seal what took place in heaven two thousand years ago are in glory all right John was taken up in Revelations 4 1. and he sees all of these things and he writes it down all right now seeing it from a Heavenly scene then God is revealing that that's going to take place on the earth and that's what we want to deal with it is the part of being on Earth in a manifestation down here on Earth and seeing and see our day and its time but the main thing if you're understanding me then the seals are broke the prophet didn't break the seals the prophet was the seals were revealed to the prophet because they were already broken you'll read quotes now and and all and I know people will read it and they'll take it but they won't take everything but they'll read you know that they'll find where brother man said see there said the lamb broke the seal the lamb opened the seal well just remember that's what is happening but it started 2 000 years ago back there when John went to Patmos and saw these things huh but then it was placed before Mankind in a symbol form waiting the opportunity for the prophet to come to be able to speak to us amen and tell us what these things are and that was worth it he made his mistake in his early Ministry but he was preaching the white horse rider as Jesus Christ then he comes on over later like it's in one is in another sister we're talking about want to go it's in Daniel 70 weeks he mentions that the white horse riders the Antichrist you see clerks Larkin preached the one horse rider was the Antichrist before brother Randall never came along but he wasn't the prophet amen I've always said it and I don't mean it as a joke he was in the system that was the Antichrist system and it was a trinitarian probably and so the the scripture couldn't have been broke but he was just saying for what he could see point something to him all right and that was well and good whatever he saw but he wasn't the prophet see the symbol couldn't break he couldn't see what that was because the prophet said it was sealed until and the Bible said it was even Daniel says the book is sealed me right it was a seal book well I was looking at it this morning would run around and said they're laying back there he said we didn't know the book was sealed well that's in the silver well you know how many times right now how many times he said before that the book was see him but he in other words it's coming down that we didn't know how it's sealed what's going on but now we can see it so there was no way that the prophet could be the lamb he couldn't take the book you couldn't reveal the book because that was the statement or the proclamation that no man was worthy right the only one that was worthy was the Lord Jesus Christ amen the only one who could take the book open the seals is the Lord Jesus Christ the only one that can reveal the seals is the Lord Jesus Christ so we thank God for the prophet that could tell us these things and he was the one making those statements and bringing it to where you and I could follow it and then see the end time that we would be waiting it was in a symbol for him the word that the church wouldn't see what's going on like I said if we if it wasn't in symbol for him see they wouldn't be no mystery there wouldn't be no waiting and all this be open right the whole Bible is written symbols on Parables and money amen that way he would keep you and I on our toes trying to study it out trying to see wanting to know yes man what these things work you see I thank God I run into the man I did to introduce me to the message because he began to talk about the seals and the things he would just talk a little and I had beginning to read well I wanted one of them seal books you know but he didn't want me to have one of them and he told me he did I said well I want to get in them seals he said don't want you to he said I want you to get a background a study so he gave me certain messages he gave me a church age book in the things you know I've told you this many times before but did it finally one day he said I think you can understand here you can now see a book well you know what I'm honest and admit it I ain't really enjoyed it it was really opening of a lot of things in my eyes but I'm as honest as can be where most people say well well I read that to your book and man that's wonderful well that's true do you know what I'm doing I realized that I wasn't understanding what he was saying you know what I've done I like to see a book down I went back to the church handbook because I had enough understanding that I had to get a background because if it wasn't opening up the way that I thought it would I realized I must go back I went back to the church age book I studied that church a book about the ages and things and then one day I started back in reading the seal book well you know what I got a lot better understanding because I began to see the layout the ways he was speaking and the things that would help me to understand but what if I didn't have the background now we're going to read in a minute and we're going to show that the Antichrist is a spirit right right now what if you didn't have the background to see how the ages came down and at that nickel Nathan Spirit started back there and come down and he's still here today how would you understand the Antichrist but see then that's what I've tried to get people to see the seals is a revelation of Jesus Christ it's not revealing the Antichrist the Antichrist is revealed in opposition I ordered trinitarian take a seal book you pick it up and read and eat it you know we just give him a little bit out of him and you read Diary Norman Blood Horse ridership Antichrist Larkin said that many other people may have said that it wouldn't mean a thing but you see that's why that struck me because that's the way they open to me and I was telling you I told you many times I was running a job that that it took two men to run when I was out they were trying to pressure me into quitting and I just held on until the God come on the scene to release it but in doing all of that I was writing notes to come home and preach off the seals and things well then it just unfolded that first seal if it wasn't the Antichrist being revealed it was a revelation of Jesus Christ all right now I could see that but then one day and just something just down through my knowledge just spoke he said when you see two people in the Bible one of them's got to be in the Antichrist because there's no two people in God right that's what people in this message the two Lords of people like that they say that Jesus was one person and God was another that's his trinitarianism any trinitarian concept we're right when you say this two persons there's many manifestations of God but there's only one Reverend said he is not the second person he's not the first even the first person right he said he is the person that's right all right so then when I read to see a book the next time I began to see you know invite you to go through the seal book and just read and underline every time he talks about that Antichrist and he'll say see that other guy see that other fellow see him riding off I'm sitting here stands a lamb with a book in his hand went to a trinitarian I wouldn't mean a thing with it a trinitarian you can have three or four people sitting on the book in his hand you know he got all in person running around right my brother around him you know what he said he says my Revelation Christ the lamb and the Holy Ghost is the same person amen and he said then that other fellow writing off another guy leaving right you would have to be the Antichrist right right George revealing Jesus Christ not revealing of the of the Antichrist it's a revealing of Jesus Christ amen let's quote prayer this morning who is those seal it's revelation of Jesus Christ amen he is no seals the prophet would say you see then you said well what about the Antichrist that's the opposition you know you see people in the message preachers they're constantly beating you over the head with everything and they said boy we got a hard message well we got a hard Mission 40 years later boy we got a heart mission 40 years later they're still preaching the same thing they was 40 years ago he said well no no I ain't tell nobody how to preach I'm just telling you how that it looks to me okay right if you haven't progressed an understanding in 40 years I'm not going to sell you your back foot I'm going to tell you you're lost that point enough I'm not going to say you're back to it I'm going to say you're lost you mean we've been studying a book will that be something for the doctors a little over 100 years ago somebody get sick man you're just so weak and rung out you go to the doctor and then you just you're staggering to get in he sets you down he said yep we need to be bleed you a pie right right that was their way of getting the blood to redo itself and you know what a lot of people got well but you know what a lot of people died they needed a couple of pints instead of making a few out of them what would the doctors today say come on well I think that's the way it is in the message I think it's about time the prophet said to rub out some unbelief yeah yes the more we can see the true revelation of Jesus Christ amen right well brother damn all I've ever known my whole life is I read the seal books and that first seals one or Friday yeah because that's where you've been touted but have you seen Jesus Christ if you haven't seen Jesus Christ through the opening of the word then the word's not open not plan enough right amen no stumbling stuttering there's nothing just plain Lauren said if you read the Bible and don't see Christ in every verse what did he say he said go back and read it again cause you missed something joints over God so and so and so and so we got so-and-so and so and so to God so and so and so and so they got so and so and I'm quoting scripture right that's hard to see Christ isn't it that's what he said but after a while you find out them shorts over God so-and-so leads you right down to David all right so until we got so-and-so leads you right down to Jesus Christ right so it is Christ in every verse you're not looking for Jesus in every word he's looking for Christ all right see when you see the Christ in your true born-again Christian you won't see Christ somewhere else we're going to get to that in a minute now you don't see Christ somewhere else brother told me one time he said I see Christ in in myself I said good but you got to see Christ in Jesus first because you see it in yourself you might wind up being Antichrist come on but if you see it in Jesus and then see that same Christ dwelling in you then you see in Jesus Christ that's all the message the prophet broke I thought the whole Bible was a revelation of Jesus Christ see then if you look at that first ceiling read it you'll see that he's talking about some other fellow and some other guy something else please in opposition to you but as I said now we'll get back to the scripture in a minute if you can't see Christ in the Bible and now you're going to see them in yourself that's right right and then what are you going to do with no man be called Jesus the Christ accepted me by what somebody else say it and then what scripture is saying no except it be the Christ is in you all right the Christ is in you then you can see it all right so let's think on these things now and just start on something John sees whoever ended up this morning two thousand years ago in glory of the opening of the seals it was almost 2 000 years before it would come down to someone that would be on earth that could understand those symbols right that's right I hope you see where the emphasis is being put if God hadn't sent us a prophet where would we be where would we be today if God hadn't sent a prophet to you and I will be sitting out there unorganized religion this is like everything else and you know what we'd be doing right right I know you don't like to meet Grand because you know something's fixing to come we would be Glory Hallelujah we're in the bride playing it great that we're serving God one of the one of them because it's three persons of him and we don't know so maybe one of them is taking care of us right right where would we be if God hadn't sent a prophet he promised he'd do it amen what's that Prophet to do take all of the Loose Ends that man has left foreign and reveal the word that's right do you and I that we could become that word and walk off the earth so now and we were saying that as we start on this we back up to where we were in chapter five the prophet said this is the accident opening of those seals because the bride is in glory at that time but you know what like I've always told you now matching pieces right until we match what's there and we're not going there amen that's right is that a sensible statement amen right right when Martin Luther preached the just shall live by faith that was that angel in glory that was with the what is the Everlasting gospel remember that Monroe said that was Everlasting gospel what the just to live by faith you know until he came to that place he didn't match what was in heaven that was singing him but one day he did when you and I match it will be gone won't be because the bus is just pulling up for us it'll be what the scripture said they without us cannot be made perfect right right it'll be what Romans says but the whole world is growing and waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God all right you remember that message don't you what does the word manifestation mean well a great signs and wonders right there yeah yeah manifest means to make known right you know what right around done he stood on the platform and made God known all right I told you my personal opinion this is personal that was why he wouldn't let nobody preach he did for a long time you let people preach and he'd come out and pray for the sick right that was an early Ministry why don't you quit that because there wasn't none of them preaching it the way he wanted to preach that's right that's my opinion whatever yours is I don't know but see he didn't there was no message involved and he knew he'd come to bring a message amen so he brought his own message yeah many people went with the signs and wonders because it was the opening of the word see that's what the whole world was waiting on him and for a moment there it shall but it was Desiring all right now but yet as great as he was and all that brought around him done that didn't save one person I know that's hard speech to people but if I hadn't put enough emphasis upon what I believe you're in that the whole world was waiting upon this man we call William Branham to come we get a good save nobody that's right no Jesus Christ is the only one could save anybody he can't reveal anything his lips can be used his thoughts could be used but he couldn't reveal it takes the Holy Spirit to reveal it see then once you start then as we're going to do in the symbols just remember in his early Ministry even he didn't know these things because he preached it he preached the white horse rider was the Holy Ghost but then God revealed it and he got it in the right of that crime all right so let's just get started now let's go to Revelations six let's start on these things Revelation 6 1. I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard it where the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see all right one of the four bees I don't want to get that part we'll pick that up maybe later we'll but in the Thunder part of it we'll pick that up in the next Mexico really but the main thing I want you to see it was one of the Four B's he said well that was brother random one that's all right why don't just make it all the Four B's and forget it make it the Holy Spirit you're a hamburger bread they was in all of the ages coming down and that way you're not trying to make one or the other to try to prove a point because it's not going to prove any point look and I saw and behold of white horse he didn't sit on him had a bow and a Grandma's giving it to him and he went forth concrete and to conquer all right now brother Brown says go ahead brother look number one remember says it comes forth in a church symbol you get into all of this and everybody's arguing Thunders and voices and whatever but look let it come in a symbol that's the main thing I want you to think about and it came in a symbol a symbol was sent to the church okay we can argue about the voice and the Thunder and what this that a symbol they cannot be revealed until what he said here at the end time so it couldn't be made known down through there you read the first meal you'll hear the prophet saying these things there was no way for it to be known it was sent to the church as a symbol to keep her watching keep her studying then up watch when we get to it in a minute how could you write what's up there we're going to make a story on what if the Bible was written and it said the Antichrist will be Pope number so and so and so enjoy so much and his name will be so-and-so we'll never imagine this madness Presbyterian anybody could read the Bible let's say well we know who the Antichrist is but instead you got an interpretation from basically ever denomination about the Antichrist my brother-in-law is a Baptist preacher he said one day that Antichrist becomes it'll be a great big old Beast rise up alios I'm walking I said we're not going to deceive anybody yeah good brother that's what he thought no there's a Doctrine among organized religion and I never didn't understand Europe some of you maybe know more about it I'm sure than I do but it was to be a Syrian coming from somewhere certain country who's to be that for those that are believe in that are always looking for somebody from Syria you know this next folk comes from Syria that's him well you know I've always been one thing I believe in anchoring you feed into what's right but I never believed in paddling mud you know I believe in getting anchored and see you get your eyes set on looking for a certain thing what if it don't come that way they're teaching some in the message now that this pope now has got a dime get out of the way go to number so and so and so and so and so and so according to their records gonna be the last one well according to the Mayan calendar it's supposed to be the last year on the Earth but if you've checked into that and you know I read but I read a little bit of the fine print a lot of people read the front headlines and quit the Mayans had even things that spoke of later after this year and that's the kind of the way people are this next Pope coming up is supposed to be the one to bring the end of the world but just in case he's not we got a poke a second ago with third and fourth and fifth to come after him you know you know what I mean right right yeah but always got it figured out like a brother said they're in 63 he said what do you think about this Rapture coming in Easter Sunday Resurrection rapture 73. I mean 63 73 73. praise the Lord he said you sound like you don't blame it I said well we don't have anything by the prophet to say he said well said they do have it figured out if it don't come on Good Friday it'll come 40 days later or something like that I know I mean you know what I said I said now sounds like you don't believe it no they already had 30 40 days left over just in case right that's what people do why don't you stand out there and say this is it that's right but people don't want you to say that they want you to have opinions I approved in 1974 that we could pass the year 2026 and not break right around this message but nobody wants to hear it why I said it but you know what we're here we passed it a long ways see if you know where he is you don't have to worry about it but if you don't then you're worried but see it was right in a symbol form to keep the church waiting a symbol of them Bible horse and a writer sitting on his back we thank it like running around and said in his early Ministry that it was like that he had a the Cupid Had a Little Bow and he's riding shooting the Holy Spirit was shooting the people you know the love but you know what it says there that he had a bow and didn't I know Iris so if that was Cupid he couldn't shoot too much right that's right see we don't think when we're reading the prophet didn't say that that was Cupid Shuffle Iris he was telling what other people believed right I don't think he ever did believe it was Cupid doing that thank you but what he believed it finally come out to the right thing all right but now look it's in a symbol form it's Satan he said changing his mask and he says you want me to tell you who this is he said it's the Antichrist he wouldn't pull nothing up bro let's see what is it okay number three number three let's look what he says that's paragraph 293 of the first seal all right and the second seal comes forth and goes around out into the end third seal kind of go down to N4 field six up one to about an end at the end time these books that's been rolled up all this time with these Mysteries into them is broken and out comes the mission to see what it is but actually we started Ford they started for it at the first church age I want you because the first church they received a message like this a white horse rider went out see who is he he's Mighty in his conquering power he is a great Feller in this talking power you want me to tell you who he is he's the Antichrist he said he started out in the first church age church that's what I don't understand why the people would turn off from me to speak and say that the actual manifestation of those things is to take place when we leave out of here when we see the greatest revelation of all we can see where the Antichrist started and now it's LED down to where it is what else would you want and to see that Antichrist as it starts as he's written there a white horse rider went out who is he signed the crowd he's minding his power was a great fell in his conquering power he only tell you who it is the Antichrist because you see if an antichrist Jesus said that the two would be so close together until it would deceive the very elected the right if it was possible Antichrist is the Antichrist spirit now go back and read the seal book first seal he never walked out there as a man the Antichrist now listen he's not a man it's a spirit that's right the spirit becomes incarnate in a man amen now you got his connection but he's a spirit to start with that's right they didn't go out in the first church age the Antichrist it didn't conquer that much it was conquered by the people who preached against it God is the spirit it's not to say a man all right let's just read these scriptures you know that John Little John saw the Antichrist you know that John's the only one that called it the Antichrist you know that Paul did as much as he saw never called it the Antichrist he called it Grievous wool he saw the spirit and what it was go ahead and pull up the scriptures John there but Paul never saw what John saw John went to Patmos and come back and wrote it all right now this in the Little John's The Book of John that John was the author of was written somewhere pretty close to 80 50. most everybody thinks of what Jesus was going along you know the disciples had a pen and a piece of paper yes just Regina she's reading the Bible she read so far she didn't sign that I don't know why she wanted me to sign she's reading it but that's what she wants so I signed it no okay if it's the show that she read the Bible and I signed it okay but listen Church that Antichrist spirit didn't start out as a man he was a spirit that's right the Pope that one day will be Satan incarnate the pope himself will not be the devil right amen you're just being the one that Satan is Incarnate in now so what does John called as I said Paul he said Grievous wolves John wrote in the Book of John about 80 50. he goes to Batman's around 1895-96 he comes back writes the book of Revelation then he writes the the little Johns we call it first second third John he writes them after he comes back because he's seen the Antichrist he's seen it as a white righteous Church but Paul would only call it Grievous wolves because he was not chosen for that part but look like John we say with the Antichrist John 2 and 18 said little children it is the last time as you have heard the Antichrist shall come even now there are many Antichrist whereby we know that it is the last time there's many Antichrist now how did he know it was an antichrist look at the next one John 1 22. I joined first John 2 22. who is a liar but he that denied that Jesus is the Christ not was the Christ he is the Christ he is Antichrist that denied the father and the son you know I've had trinitarians to say if I deny the father I would deny the son if I don't believe in a trinity you ever talked to one had you say that to you using that verse scripture they say I can't deny the Trinity because I deny one of them because if I did not want on God the other one that's how deceiving it is but John calls it a liar a person that believes that Jesus is not the Christ is a liar he's already caught by an antichrist spirit that's right yet he thinks he's in the gospel look at the next one first John 4 and 3. in every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God and this is that Spirit of antichrist whereof you have heard that it should come in even now already is it in the world now trinitarian Doctrine believes that Jesus Christ come in the flesh right that's a predator and Doctrine that Jesus Christ come in the flesh that he was here that's not scripture right you that denied that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh now that's right here today he is his present tense all right now look at the lights one second John 1 7 for many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus is come in the flesh this is a deceiver and an antichrist now John said the Antichrist was already dark but remember what the first sealed then when it would break it would show this horse and the rider run around say it's the Antichrist and it starts out I've got these on down through here but you need to see a book it starts out as a little Saiyan a Saiyan becomes a Doctrine a Doctrine becomes a law or a set of rules whatever you want to call it you know what caused came to kill Abel it was his Doctrine okay because he was rejected as to his sacrifice made him highly upset that was his deed he offered what he thought God worked like everything to bring forth his little thing his little thoughts in his mind his little saying little you know he put it into a deed he went out and gathered all in the fruit made a beautiful offering but then he jumped onto able about it because God had told us it came if you had done like your brother you have been received his deed his Saiyan become a deed his deed become a Doctrine and that's where you'll find a second seal when we get to it or the red horse rider he went out and killed Cain because of his Doctrine am I right amen because God rejected what he's done when did he get mad at God no we ain't gonna do that to his Doctrine caused him to kill right there's plenty of people in this message now I'm going to say the way I believe it right there's plenty of people in this message would like to shut me up I don't mean they want to kill me I ain't saying somebody wants to they can ring in that and kill you and cut your throat because Cain didn't want to do that start with it had to be that Satan become incarnate in Cain you agree amen right when there's thoughts and his ideas that was his blood brother because they were two different Bloods that's all right same mama but it become so straight until Cain finally killed his brother that's your Antichrist you ever notice it run around says everything started in Genesis he said all these doctrines started in Genesis now that's something ain't it Methodist Baptist Presbyterian randomize a little ice who the eyes or wherever you want to go we have a doctor in this contrary to God's word it surely didn't begin in heaven the prophecy to be gone in the garden right you see anything that denies that Jesus Christ has now come into flesh now if you think I ain't right find you a trinitarian and tell him that and ask him do you think Jesus Christ is now in flesh brother you're crazy so I'm not talking about a human mortal standing there Jesus I'm talking about living in you well now in a way run I guess you could say that but let's don't go too far now we make too much out of ourselves thank you I don't think we went far enough I used to like brother most definition of a lot of things I love this one you said you can't sin enough to be lost all right if you're born again you can't say enough to be lost I like that then you turn around say yeah but if you ever if you're saved you ain't gonna be well you ain't getting the point either but listen okay never spirit isn't that Spirit one of you agree that the new birth in your heart is the baptism of the Holy Ghost is like Jesus said it all right it's an antichrist spirit you remember I told you about the man that Jeff that time was oh man Alberta Brown was deity I said well brother I believe in deity I guess he thought he had him a good convert but I said now take it apart the fact that brother Reynold was a prophet and the gifts and the sons the things that went with his life I said separate that part I said brother Brown had the baptism when the Holy Ghost you agree he said yes I said well I believe in that being God in him but I said this brother right here if he's got the baptism with the Holy Ghost I said that's deity also he said no I don't agree with you what's that glad you I was talking to a person who believed right around was God right see I believe ever born again Christian remember said it was deity speaking right right look at that but you see it's all in the way you say nice he doesn't believeth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God with he that denied that Jesus Christ has come into flesh is an antichrist see now watch what I'm saying at the time he started out he had no horse to ride you remember it says that there was one horse he'd sit on him you know but in his beginning he didn't have a horse to be able to ride it was just a spirit it's the spirit among the people after a while you connect on over that we got it becomes from a Antichrist spirit you come to a prophet come on you've read you see a book and to a prophet now not talking about a true prophet a prophet is one who teaches a message or a Doctrine see that Antichrist spirit it says it and he had a bow and no errors right right the bluff the prophet said all right and what did it say about him he that set upon him in a bowl and a crown was given him you can't Crown the spirit that's right right it's going to be coming the next stage of understanding he became a false prophet that's where he got his crown you just started out teaching it making Bishops and making all kind of things that's why I said it I really enjoyed the church age book because I could follow a chain of those things but there he was a prophet our people begin to take that Doctrine and they begin to preach it here's where the people miss it stood in the seal book but Arundel mentioned it he says Antichrist Prophet Beast they don't listen careful enough then to keep reading until he says it this way to make it right Antichrist prophet incarnate folks brother that's in the seal book he said then he becomes the Beast I've got a quote laying up here then when he first started out he couldn't be the Beast you can only be an antichrist you see the revealing of Jesus Christ shows us who the Antichrist is Jesus Christ he has come in the flesh by the new birth right Satan denies that wants to make it the second person or something right yeah that's right but did he become a prophet down through the time you read the seal book and see if I'm right you become a prophet that began to preach his message you know Satan's got a five-fold Ministry hmm you didn't know that and they can be transformed even as the scripture says angels of life now he's got his own faithful Ministry and he began to send it out teaching teaches Doctrine and after a while they become so connected to that Doctrine they become one with it to become a prophet of that system Same Spirit begins to pick up then and come into the stage of Incarnate false prophet nurse when you Pope comes in do you know it didn't start out with a pope by turning the time of tall there was no Pope you call them Grievous wolves come on read yourself book I'm in the cell message I'm bringing it right out of the boat he becoming incarnate false prophet that's when he got his crown a triple ruling crown of Rome right when you become an incarnate false prophet an antichrist incarnate a spirit becomes incarnate he started out in the ages as just being a little saying a little Doctrine then if it started from a saying to a doctrine of mankind and they become a preacher to that Doctrine prophets of that Doctrine but then one day he got a crown they're coming in according to false prophet you see one day that same Antichrist spirit will finally turn out to be the Beast we'll see you and I see what I'm so happy about the way that I believe because I can look back there and see what that Prophet said and I can watch that spirit and I look around the people in the message especially the ministry you see good honest-hearted sincere preacher but you see little doctor and little Saiyans we've had them to come right here right and when I questioned a brother later and told him I didn't agree he said well you know people preach that and I just believed it um you remember you remember about the Judah and the Tamar they were trying to preach now that was a great lineage to come down and Judah planted his seed into Tamar to save her I told him I said that'd make sex a savior and I don't agree with it I said seed went Blended in our savior well you better be careful because that same seed in there produced winds right one of them was forever right but I said come down to David the other one I can't remember his name you know where it went it went to Aiken you remember that with the Babylonian garment that's where the other line went to but you see it was a saying it just sound good well all the big preachers are preaching it oh my you remember the story I told you about the brother preaching it they brought around was the one to come to General Patton and I just told him I said don't believe it but amen I still believe it was the Lord Jesus Christ that done the brother animal path he said yeah but it's got to be an angel that's who it was the angel of the Lord Jesus Christ the prophet what you see his point was that's what people preach these four brothers overseas you at least got the tapes in the books to check out Honeys with these four brothers that come from overseas like the brother stood here to Wednesday night and said we only got about 200 messages in our language well and then people go over there you know when I went to the Philippines you know what used to be the biggest Doctrine in the Philippines was a two Soul Doctrine well they had no way to contradict that Doctrine until God allowed books and tapes to come their way see it's a saying you get it Antichrist spirit it starts out as a spirit not as a man starts out as a spirit a little saying that's why I come here every once in a while clip things you know say something about things he said oh you don't got that brother sincere I guess he asked me sincerely wrong for it I'm concerned when they start bringing out stuff like that and I'm Pastor I'm supposed to correct those times oh but you remember a spirit got onto some people you show you how good a spirit can get on people you know that Moses stood there one day and said I was on God's side come over here yeah 250 priests with sisters in their hands off of the fire of the altar fell in the ground preacher right right the next day right come on read your Bible the next day they come to Moses and said you kill the people of God that's right right do you think that doctor hadn't hung on you think that Spirit hasn't gotten them people it was on the same ones that wasn't the ground I believe I'd at least waited three days you know maybe a week yeah but the next day that's right see I know in first journey I know the truth about what people are and the way they think there's somebody right here different from me for him to be him and they already said it were and fell over digging 50 percent of you would believe I was wrong well brother Dale well you want to make it 51. brother Dale that's a good brother ain't no problems about good Brothers Robin Hood Rob the rich gave the poor what good does that mean it wouldn't have been much profit in robbing the poor to probably give him the poor I think you're smart I'm gonna get my point my spirit gets among people I watch it here I see Spirit brother told me one day brother Wendy from here never had been here and didn't know the person we were standing outside and he looked at me and he said brother Dale that man's trying to bust up your church so what I know all about it you better get out there they worried about it do we want to eat the brother told me again he said I'd rather shine a bust your church up I should watch it and I'll show you I get up I walk over and I sit down Lee immediately the conversation stopped I walk out here a lot of times and I see you talking and I just walk around and I just stop the conversation changes you think I don't know what you see I'm still trying to be Christ because I know it's just a spirit it is among you I know a lot of spirits come in here and get among the people and I watched that very closely which is me when I do come out and say something about it you offended that person it's the same people that said you killed a big blue God see what an antichrist is can we look at an antichrist and run around and say a white horse and a rider and an antichrist it was a spirit that started among the people now you want another good illustration of a spirit of an antichrist why was Lucifer cast out in heaven come on as long as he casting out of heaven he had a saying that a bunch of angels picked up and they believed it right and they believed Satan's saying and when it become a Doctrine he'd become to an issue and Michael had to cast him out right because Michael was Christ see Gabriel couldn't handle it prevent Brooklyn Daniel might try to come to Daniel through Gabriel and he couldn't get that Ricky bubble 23 days or 21 days or something that he was hindered he said until Michael your friends came to my Aid in other words and when he did now I'm able to come on here because Gabriel couldn't handle Lucifer look Michael came and who is Michael he's Christ who is this we're talking about the revelation of Jesus Christ is what cast The Devil out that's right now come on you know yourself as I said a moment ago you see preachers that after 40 years they're still preaching higher dress closing brother Dale you don't live in preaching higher addressing love I don't believe it's the way most preachers I don't I don't believe it's salvation I believe you can have a dress dragging the ground and you're higher running off and dragging your tracks out and still be as dead and sincere of a devil has ever been but if God is in the heart your heart might not be that long but when you don't cut it that's what it means in the Bible is 40 foot long higher and you take an eighth of an inch off that's good right a long higher is the scissors has never been in it you African people your heart doesn't grow long does it come on what you see a little saying a little Doctrine don't you think brother Dale's kind of out of a bad attitude seemed like lately he's been real harsh mean and takes a lot of hard things to us what if that's the Holy Ghost s what if the Holy Ghost is telling me make it hard and strong can you eat it see a spirit that Antichrist is still right here any word you see Jesus Christ now hope of Illustrated with Michael and stuff like that enough for you to see any time you see a spirit he's trying to turn you against the truth just as a little saying all I got to do is say you know you do this and you get in trouble over the time I say brother dick watch brother Carly got it gets get off forget it I should have said that I should have said that really I should have said that that's all it takes the rest of the day brother Dick's going around watch brother call he got against me a week later he said watch brother call he got against me then one day he walks up said what do you got against me right the spirit so the easy the end of Christ here don't you think that brother Abraham is deity well you know if you're getting dressed order but but brother don't you think that he's just a little bit above us I think he's a member of the body of Christ right amen I think he was God's messenger brought to us all right that's true but as far as a human in the body of Christ he's no different all right you will not be set upon a pedestal come on because of him just being born again he'll be set up on a pedestal and honored because of the gifts in his life and because he yielded himself to those things but he's no different than anyone else in the body of Christ said there's no big eyes and little u's that's what I've always said and I love that scripture the least in the kingdom of God is greater than John the Baptist that's Bible yeah look what honor we give to John of the introducing of the Messiah which is the only thing just a little sayings I've told you you go back and read and see if I'm right the first night seeing Council of 325 A.D was not was not now read it if you don't I'll get you to vote it's in your computer run over there where it says the United fathers and pre-nicity and father the First nassian Council was not an argument over whether they was one God or three it was over whether or not Jesus was the substance or a light substance and their first Nicene Council statement come on I haven't seen these and read it I wouldn't have believed it was God their first statement was from the Nicene Council Jesus is almighty God that's their first statement but you see then that little saying got started by the time they come to 606 then they begin to develop a trinity from the fact of saying that Jesus was not the substance of God he was a light substance making him a demon god which means the Lesser God it took 600 years to get that saying to become a Doctrine that's how deceiving it is read your first seal he went from a deed to a Doctrine to a governmental form in other words men and then it went to an incarnate false prophet in the Pope and one day Satan will be incarnate in the Beast well that's your four stages of your Antichrist but what I love is on the other side the four stages what are the bug that made it down four stages brought it back justification under Luther sanctification on the west Pentecostal baptism when the Holy Ghost and then the word the word through the prophet to tell you the deception of these things now close it can be thinking on these things come on brother remember that's an argument communities fixing it let's just stand and sing a little song if anybody has a need we don't want to have it be unless you know there's nobody has a need we want to do that let's just sing a little M or something I love him you have a name go into the community First Love Me
