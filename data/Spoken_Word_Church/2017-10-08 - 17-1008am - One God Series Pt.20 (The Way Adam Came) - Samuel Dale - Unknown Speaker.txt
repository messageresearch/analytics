«  E-22       †        Let's close our eyes to our imaginations for a few moments and go way back into the--'fore there was anything. The great fountain of all eternity was that spirit of love, joy, that spirit of honesty, that spirit of trueness in this perfection. And then out of the existence of the Father went the Logos which was the Son, which was the theophany, which was the body of the great Jehovah God went forth in a celestial Body. That's the Logos. The Word spoke out of them great Fountains of Life and went forth. And there was the theophany, which was God made into Word.

    Or, as I have went through it, the Catholic call It, "the eternal sonship of God."... Which as I have said before, the word doesn't even make sense. See, there cannot be an eternal son, because a son had to have a beginning. And so Jesus had a beginning; God had no beginning. See? But the Son was the... Not eternal sonship, but the Son that was with the Father in the beginning was the Logos that went out of God.
    And it was the Theophany of God that went out, the human form that didn't have eyes like you see: a better eye. It didn't have ears like you hear, but a far more hearing. See? It was a Theophany, that all this rainbow condescended into a--a Theophany. Moses saw It when It passed through the rock like that. He saw the back parts, said, "It looked like a man."

fellowship hanging and bringing out some things and parts of the things that we're speaking on you know also what you know if you'd like to follow her alone okay any other announcements on Jim DeMint and listen to brother Ron Sunday school class okay they have made a little change you know the older downstairs its weight is taking some time off from to Sunday school teaching for a while Kody's

lord thank you for the day in the hour thank you for the time that we have thank you for the word that you have been revealed in our day that we could actually follow after and come on to know the god

complete in you Lord and just that's your loving grace be with us and we pray that you touch each one that's not here remember the sick among us and just have your way that the Lord made father that you may open to us the understanding is the main thing because we know and realize that without that we have no hopes and we rest in you we love you and we thank you bless each one now you said in your word you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so let that take place among us in Jesus name Amen John one this ought to be becoming a little more clearer of our understanding it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God and I brought around him I thought of that what he said he said hold up you get on something hold up one thing he said the people get it and then move on okay we'll hold this up for a while okay the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was a lot of men and the light shine us in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not okay now we won't get all of this off but we're going over to Hebrews five and we'll pick up a few verses in verse in chapter five and then go over to chapter seven alright so five and verse five so also Christ glorified not himself to be made at High Priest and watch the scriptures and listen but he that said unto Him thou art my son as Hebrews 10 5 you begotten him today have I begotten thee as he said also in another place dar - priest forever after the order of Melchisedec who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong strong crying in tears unto him that was able to save him from death was heard in that he feared now that was this Christ the Son of God hanging on the cross all right though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things that he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey Him called of God and high priest after the order of melchizedek all right now you know that the argument that the Prophet brought out is in showing us who is this Melchizedek and the things that some says it's a priesthood some says it says some says it's that and trying to make it but putting it together now with this thought in Chapter 7 I remember he's high priest after the order of Melchisedec for this melt shattered it king of Salem priest of the Most High God who made Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed him to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of Salem which is king of peace without father without mother without descent neither having beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the Son of God about it the priest continually now watch this now consider how great this man and would just a priesthood it's a man that consider how great this man was unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the Spoils you may be seated Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now we were discussing this a little last night in the Bible study and see for quite a while now this is 20 messages on this series part and my thought has been to try to get you and I to realize how real God is that's why I read that from you know chapter five and then go to chapter 7 because if you stick with chapter five you're staying with even though you would be talking about a son of God you would stay with an order of of a priesthood style but then when you get over in Chapter seven it brings that down from a priesthood style to a man and that's the Christ the Son of the Living God who is what Almighty God condescending down for you and I to be able to understand him now that's the purpose of of what is taking place now alright now the last Sunday we covered talking about that we were going to cover like three things one how God condescended down to you know reveal himself or come into being come into manifestation alright then we're going to talk today more on how that Adam came into being okay and then if we get through this in time we will try to cover today if not we'll cover it next Sunday on how that you and I come in to be alright see that way we can follow it to the scriptures and I was thinking there last night as we were talking you know what are the great opportunity that you and I have had for God to reveal himself to you and I what great thing would you think we could do to merit that what would be anything you and I could even consider has to be merits of the basis that he would do this that he would reveal himself the bringing himself into being what a wonderful opportunity to think about that God condescended to mankind and we know the reason that he came was for the fact that he would have to come and fulfill all of the word alright he would come to the basis that his purpose for coming the way he came all right was to be able to die in the place of mankind to be a savior to fulfill all of his attributes see we went through a lot of the things he created Adam that would have made him father angels worshiped him that would have made him God a lot of those things were attributes that he had but he had other attributes right he wanted to be a savior a healer etc and to do that it would mean that he would have to come into human flesh but remember it's the same God being revealed not a Trinity or a concept or a thought or ideas and that's why to me like brother Branham on who's this Mel Saturday that he was trying his best to lay down how real God was you know and he said people would say you mean to tell me that Melchizedek was God he said that was Almighty God stepped into a human vessel and appeared to Abraham and the things you know and doing those things because that was his purpose in doing all right now to do that then he would have to condescend award mankind and that's the point I've been making and we'll keep making it for you to understand that he kinda sins but he doesn't change melih Khatri said I'm God and I changed not then he changed his forms to reveal himself but he doesn't change himself he's not one person over here and another person over here another person over here there's not three persons me all right it's the same God being revealed or being made manifest you said well why didn't he do it this away all right why don't you tell him how to do it that's what the scripture said who was back there to tell me how to do these things you know there's no way that anybody can tell him how to change things because the way he came was the way the perfect way of coming all right but what about you and I see still trying to follow something on the lines of our original thoughts of you know that well God is just the spirit brother Dale has spent months and months talking about how real God is and he's just a spirit no he's not just the spirit God is a spirit when you put the just on now you're making him something that your limited him to some form are doing well but we've went back to into eternity to come out from there to see how real he was back there and how he had a form and all of the things and it's coming down to revealing to itself now to where we can follow and and follow in the word to be able to realize where you and I stand and what God has done for you and I to reveal himself now we talked about we've been talking for quite a while about how that he would like to say the word in morphe which would be change in form alright but not change in persons now there was a time that I was just a child a son but then time developed own and I became a husband time developed own and I became a father time developed owner became a grandfather time developed to only become a great-grandfather now if your hope it doesn't go on to the great great and great great great great get all them others you know I don't want dad but the thing of my I'm getting out what it it's the same person well I thought so simple why didn't the theologians think of that when they were looking at the wordings annoying and they were even using the words in morphe to change in form and things like that they had those things in there they're doing but yet it was suing to mass confusion till they couldn't follow and like I've always tried to tell you see the scholars knew that that one that came out from God in the beginning would be called a son of God but see we want to make it another person or another concept or thought instead of it being the same person being revealed and that's why I've tried my best to get you to to hang on to the points that when you say all God was he poured into Christ well don't do away with God that's just a statement then all Christ poured into the church that doesn't do away with Christ that's just a statement it's just showing you worries Act and what he's doing like I'm saying to me right now see I can say I'm a child I'm a son well my wife could raise her hand womb he's my husband the kids they can say he's my daddy the grandkids can say he's my grandpa and then finally you know come back to verse Deanna she's here or someone she would be saying that he's my great-grandpa but have it changed maybe got fatter uglier oh yeah but have it changed in the point of what I am while simple that is to think of a Godhead like that no wonder the Bible says even the eternal Godhead can be understood by the things that we see but that's been my purpose in my thought to try to get us to not get tied up in anything but just follow along simply and come down alright we spent quite a while talking about the great eternal God and then that he had these attributes he had all the time and he began to come to sin and he condescended into what the scholars would call him the logos little oh gosh would mean speech so he condescended to her that he could speak it wasn't that he couldn't speak it was the way he chose to come forward I want you to follow that it was the way he chose to do it one goes you know he chose the perfect way see then when he who comes into the form of to be able to speak see now he doesn't just you know say back he comes forth unveils himself and they use the word theophany and in doing that then you're coming to as we were covering life Sunday then you're coming to what he was calling from who is this Melchizedek a word body a word form body remember that see Jesus Christ came that away not Jesus - flesh no that's one in the Hebrews there it talks about it he see this one your son has a beginning but in Jesus Christ it wasn't no son having a beginning as something starting it was the flash man the flash is what you're talking about at a beginning not the Christ not too low cost not to speech not the thing not the eternal God didn't have a beginning it was the flash man that had a beginning right see then in that as he then became the one that the Bible would say that he created all things by Jesus Christ right he became the word or took a form or whatever you want to call it stepped over into condescended into another form to speak or be the word and he's called it the off the body art he came that away all right we'll catch where the Prophet said you and I by Pais that will see he came that away he came into that form and I way I love it is the way the Prophet brought it out he said you say was he in a theophany before he said that's whom else yes it was read who is this melchester dick over and over he said that's where he come in to Melchizedek to prove that he was the word he'd already created he had already brought everything into being to prove that he was the word but yet he stepped into Melchizedek or didn't you know you know what I'm talking about how the prophet described it he said he just said nobody come forth God was in that body that we call Melchizedek who was in that body the same God that created the world then what happened that same God Lorenz said we see no more of Melchizedek in that an odd statement of things and it just looked like something gone you know like it you don't need that no more it's gone no that's not what he's talking about he said we see no more of milk Saturday he said because Jesus Christ milk said it becomes Jesus Christ all right see then they're on the shores of galleries are the baby in the cradle whatever you want to talk about was that very almighty god that created the world was laying in that cradle as a baby is it hard for us to follow he shouldn't be and hard to comprehend the simplicity of the way the Prophet brought it makes it so simple until we can understand see but he became then the he was the word a theophany body a word body that was where he stepped over into a form called the word a word body the Prophet would call him signifying that something was real not just a spirit creating they become more into what we could look at his tangible forms or words or whatever to express and see that's why I said about then he didn't just stay back that's creator the same God came in to flesh and appeared to Abraham the same one that created the world then the same one was a baby in the cradle because there he would almighty god body created by the word soul and spirit being Almighty God himself dwelling in human flesh to your prophet would say your little Jehovah crying in the cradle your little God with no teeth that's wonderful though the man could make the term who was a theologian had never thought of those type of ways to express and see you'll know that it couldn't come to a theologian because we couldn't understand the terms and in the ways that he was talking about but just remember you remember how we kept them from bringing it all out what he was a man he was a man he wasn't just a myth or a thought or a concept or a spirit he was a man the man Christ Jesus the Bible calls it something tangible where you can follow after it see not another person like I said I changed from son to father you know the husband to father the grandfather the great grandfather but I never changed it was just the way that I'm gonna do and listen and still all of those that's the point I want you to see about God I'm still all of those forms right because I've become married didn't do away with me being a son because we become a father doesn't Matt do away with in it like it's I still got those forms well see Father Son and Holy Ghost he didn't move over in another form and do away with the app but I've listened and you have yourself if you just think you've heard sermons on all God was he poured into Christ all means all now all was it all maybe you don't listen in like you don't listen now too but taint all God was he poured into cry did that do away with God he still got that phone to prove it he's got that form Jesus the Christ spoke to the Father from the earth but you see what my point trying to get us to see one true and living God and see how he came into being the word that he could create and do all the things and bring us into being and see then that God he wouldn't be another person brother branham will get it he said you see that he's hung up too low gosta theophany the word look he said like a child playing before the father's door he never done away with the father like I said I heard him that all and and see when they're all oh god why he poured in the cross well now when you say that with that meaning without explaining it what do you ask what are you emphasizing between no God go - oh god why would you pour it in the crash well that don't leave you God at least Christ I don't sound too bad but what about all Christ poured into the church you realize you only got the church Church I'm sorry I'm sorry for this tape and have always made at that point and I wish I could never had the statement to mate but do you realize what you're doing you are right in the devil's trap the people of this message are following the devil of a trap of what is there saying all God was you just do away with God all Christ you just do well cry you leave the church is not that exactly what Satan says I will ascend above is not that the truth now but you don't like that so you say well he's being hateful talking about brother showing so I heard him he didn't say it like that go back and hurt it again you might hurt more the next time but that's just the point see that I've always tried to make see that way you're keeping the one God in line that way you don't have any problems with us praying to a father this in heaven yeah but he's right in here I don't have to pray see that's that's the way we the way we go then we do away with all the scripture talks about prayer pray without ceasing well if you don't it's like what sister who used to play the piano for us years ago she said the way that y'all are teaching the Godhead said who do I pray to he said because I'm that God I said you went too far that ain't what we're teaching you've done away with some things that ain't the way that I'm trying to bring it you see that was her she don't I who drop right if you do away with God put it all in Christ and do what Christ put it in charging in here you just pray to yourself cuz you're the god is he not realizing how Satan's got its you in his traps okay but listen see he never changes my whole point when God moved he didn't move over into enough he just took another form to reveal himself as the word all right as a word body the fullness of God dwelt in that right but see there's no way none of us can be the fullness so then what we got to go from your own is we can't make any of us the fullness we make us together as one in Christ as the fullness yes because the Godhead brother Ennis is not complete without you see we've got to keep that line and that thought keeping it to where we can look at it he's called a word body so remember how he is a word body are you listening see I know a lot of you ain't call don't know what you're doing but listen he was word body theophany word body he came that away but see you and I've got to bypass that to come into flesh to be tempted all right now but think about how he came and think about what we're seeing that is a theophany is a word body that's the hardest thing seemingly for us to keep away from our own of it when you say Piaf knee up in heaven something up dire worse above it's about it's a word body in Jesus Christ Himself was that Almighty God the same one that created the world was standing on earth in the human flesh right and inside of him was that very word that's according to the scripture in the beginning was the word word was gotten word was God then why would verse 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us she's been thinking about how that he came forth see he didn't have to come from this to this to there that was the way he chose for the revealing himself he didn't listen I'm quoting brother Adam warrior and it's he who claimed right around to be a prophet so we ought to be able to quote him see he said Jesus couldn't be tempted you ever noticed him saying I don't want we need to turn right back around and said Jesus was tempted in the wilderness and he talked about what's he saying is he so much contrary he doesn't understand his own language that he's music it was the point that he never come to the earth to be tempted right he came to earth to live as a mortal being which would mean that he would come in to a point of being tempted because the Bible says no end Tim's God you said what the devil took him up and showed he mr. Jody man that's right but he never yielded to another thing that the devil ever had either right think about it now listen we got into a point and I emphasize a little bit on the last message this is what happens brother Brennan said on who is God he said that he come out of the bosom of the Father well that looked like two people don't that's not two people that's God manifesting himself remember the illustration I'm a son I'm a father I'm a husband somebody else tell me there's no but I'm just one person and one reality trying to be you know standing here you looking at it see then watch what I'm trying to say you realize brother branham when placing it the way he did he would talk about that logos being the son of God now he'd never talked about the logos being the son of God the Son there's no such thing there is the son of God listed in the Bible but not God the Son see that's our ideas all right you said well it's all the same no it's not all the same but see the son was the creator that's why you keep it all tied together that when you come down he was finally standing on earth called the son of God but yet it was the Creator because he came word then flesh how do we come then the one that I love I want to want him to pull this one up cuz I'm skipping over a lot of but don't you pull up number six if you will in the notes the others are things we went over and over and over and over but listen let's move on in to at least Adam for today and look at him now think about what he's saying he's talking about the condescending of God and how that he's in a word body paragraph or two before then and then he says in this in his stage is the stage of his creation later form into flesh Jesus from what from the great beginning spirit then came down to be the word bringing itself out the word doesn't yet make itself it's just spoke out in morphe later he becomes flesh Jesus mortal to taste this for all of us now listen when Abraham met him he was Melchizedek now who's Melchizedek milchester he could Almighty God right that's the whole purpose that was all the whole message last week Melchizedek is Almighty God so now watch what he said in Morpher later Jesus mortal to taste death when Abraham met him huh o mighty God he was Melchizedek he couldn't die for you that's why Paul picks him up and saying that Melchizedek is a priesthood he's the high priest but he said Jesus is more than a high priests Melchizedek was God in a human vessel but that human vessel was just spoke into existence and spoke back out of existence all right but Jesus came in and he never laughs it's not doing it on him so he's a priesthood and that's one mankind and the Prophet read it see they've argued over and over that still one group says he's a priesthood another group says is this you know he said who is it he said he's Almighty God because he was a priest to it but that's how he could have been was a priesthood under the order that was revealed to Abraham but he was the word now listen he met Abraham he was Mel Chesney now look there's an outstanding wonderful statement right there if you just listen he unfolds here what are all the attributes are we the attributes of God so what is the Bride of Christ to do marina what all the attributes we'll do in the final end ever son of Abraham ever son of the faith will absolutely do the same thing what what is every son of Abraham to do the same thing Abraham did is that right I'm a Colin is that sensible ever son of Abraham and we're the seed of Abraham by faith we are the children of Abraham by faith and so connected to do it till you even think about it we were talking about it last night you think about it it's so connected until the old testament paradise was called the bosom of Abraham not the belly of Abraham the bosom of Abraham what the very faith of Abraham to believe God without even having a new birth God said Abraham you got it and said I'm gonna put it all on earth God I'm gonna call it the seed of Abraham right that's why you're the children of Abraham by faith but I'm not you know Jews not a Jesus a Jew either but look what happened Abraham met God melchester do all right the hoos melts edited Almighty God he's the word the Prophet brings in Hood is melt setting it down from self-existing down true to the word and said that word appeared as Melchizedek before he become flesh of Jesus Christ so what's gonna happen to ever seed of Abraham Abraham met Melchizedek which was God in a human vessel the word what's ever seed of Abraham going to do you see now and catch on to it you'll finally realize why I emphasize so much what is the new birth the new birth is the birth of the word right it's not an anointing is not a shouting is not a crying it's not a visions it's not in its the word revealed ever seed of Abraham is to meet the word while we're here now I'm giving it ahead of time brother Brennan says we meet the word here let's see we're not good Baptists or good thoughts of people they said well one of these days we're gonna be this we don't know we'll be that we would either know we're gonna meet the word right here like I was trying my best to get people to see a little bit life's not from it what we step ahead even of the world in our Redemption we're already in ahead of the world because our soul is redeemed and and our body is already claimed right we're even ahead of the world already the souls redeemed future I'm gonna read it he said waiving the redemption of the body yeah but it's already claim there's your plan of salvation the redemption darzee seals ours you think all right pull that back up now world everybody can tell he unfolds here what the attribute what all the attributes will do in the final end ever son of Abraham ever son of the faith will absolutely do the same thing what exactly like Abraham meeting Melchizedek but I want you to watch how we have to come all right but ever seed of the faith is to meet the word you see if you understand the new birth is a birth of the word then in that first church age they met the word the second church age they met the word 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th you meet the word that is your new birth and then you start a growth development from the new birth of faith of the unveiling of the word until we come out to a change in the body but we meet the word here it's not doing it some words out see that's one of this message folks this message is the Word of God if you'd ever get that in your mind you and how trouble trying to read books or listen to tapes you would realize that that message off of there that a human vessel is being used but God is speaking through that human vessel right straight to you but we read it is speaking to everybody else well if sister so-and-so would get straightened out with her dress codes and you know that's the way we read we don't read it what we are it's me in my house Lord okay what do you understand ever see to the faith is going to meet the word well I just don't know how do you meet you are you born again okay you born again then the born-again experience is what you heard the word you accepted the word and even in the Gospels that says they took the word and held on to it where the others floated away from it right and the Holy Ghost come onto their Pentecost to give birth to the word they had held there's a new birth so watch the statue of a perfect man Nolan it's the birth of the world your new birth started when you believe did you understand that woman that's why they can't understand brother Branham cuz he'll say one time you got the Holy Ghost when you believe then you don't say now you need to go get down here to the altar and get the Holy Ghost cause you already believe in that see because when you believe you started your journey but remember until the Holy Ghost comes on that to make that fully alive you notice the wording for alive in you you don't have the new birth then you come into the scriptures of what being born again you're being born again your new birth is not complete until the change of this body it's not complete adoption brings you to the authorities of sonship son done but he's got to take us on to a change to be the new birth when you when we go out of here in the air we can say our new birth is complete but until then we're being born again so he ought to know that I'm heading toward stature of a perfect man if I ever get to alright but now think about it let's think about cuz we'll at least try to cover Adam alright go ahead to number seven still offer who's this male charity paragraph sixty-seven now we see the attribute sons of his spirit have not entered into the word form body we haven't entered the word form body it's not complete yet come on can I quote brother brown he said your soul is not complete it only has the earnest you know what the earnest to your soul is eternal life you get eternal life your soul not fully complete yet why cause you statue of a perfect man right okay listen put a theophany this body is subject to the word in earnest waiting for the earnest change of the body and once you now the different between him and you as a son now the difference in him and you we're gonna read this part but then will brought over to Adam because we've got a fitted in but we're gonna be talking about you and me because there is a tiny bit differential or what it would call it difference there's a tiny difference between the way Jesus came and the way Adam came all right now there's a tiny bit of difference between the way you and I come that's the way Adam came so that's why I'm covering it in three stages all right there was a tiny bit well I was just born again like Adam that's what he said Adam wasn't born again Adam received eternal life as an impartation Oh see a lot of difference now the difference between him and you as a son he was at the beginning the word Animorph Abadi and wants him he came and lived in that before we come in flesh watching in the person of Mel chassidut then later we never heard no more of Melchisedec because he became Jesus Christ Melchizedek was the priest but he became Jesus Christ now you bypass that now what you bypass you buy pies coming to what he can mean he says you come like Adam like me you become from the attribute to the flesh to be tempted you're reading now but when this life is finished here if this earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting that's where we go that is the word now how did Adam come how did Adam come into being now Jesus came now listen to what I'm saying to the way I say it Jesus never came from attribute to word to flesh he was the attribute that's the whole thing of trying to get you see I'm a father I'm a son I'm a human I'm this but I'm still the same person he never came from attribute to word he was the attribute he was the word but Adam came from attribute come on what was his next stage the first stage of atom was what I know I'm gonna get so I'll just bring it up a little part stop okay Adam never come like Jesus in the basis he was the attribute and he was the word and are you listening Adam came from the attribute to flesh he's a winner what are you voting a minute well okay I thought we were had tall and believed it and over and over that Genesis 1:26 and 27 now we're only speaking of Adam today we're not talking about the whole thing we'll cover that later but speaking of Adam how did Adam come but arrested he comes from attribute to fit flesh to be tempted you see we'll see I know what your mind is gonna run and we had some of it lies not talking about see you're gonna run to Adam and you're gonna say that Adam couldn't do wrong well I'm gonna remind you he D now you can argue that all you won't even do it all by herself right come on but listen Adam brother instead come from attribute cuz he said you and had them come from attribute to flesh to be tempted okay Adams first beginning of ever what you want to talk about him being would be talking about Genesis 1:26 and 27 when he'd say let us make man in our own image all right now what kind of a man did God make he made a spirit man he made man in His image now we're only talking about Adam I said hold that hold it with me you out there anything he's good another message we'll cover more in two us but hold with me today because you'll never get to talk Adam came from attribute what was it attribute let us make man hurt he come from Adam attribute to flesh to be tempted didn't let us make man huh Adam came as close as could be to the right way now I want you to get this thought reading said all this back up right here on the top you realize the way Jesus came was the condescending of God okay now listen listen and don't quote me wrong the plan and purpose when it fell to mankind you got to go to Adam to find out what's taking place because Jesus Christ condescended down to earth all right you realize that Jesus Christ now listen Jesus Christ just the point away he descended if we had to come that way we could have never fallen come on Jesus Christ never failed are you with me if we become like Jesus we hadn't ever fallen even the way Adam come Adam come to where it says he was not deceived but he fell but I said there's got to be a dead little difference between the way Jesus condescended because even though he could be tempted of Satan and all of the things when he was put into flesh he would not fall right by becomes you would Almighty God but when God started his attributes to come in to be displayed if it is out spring Adam was made the most perfect way that could have ever been to were that it would bring out finally the full attributes of God now rot that thought down you write a lot of other things sometimes I tell you to write down your thoughts you don't write them if you write what you're thinking and missing what I'm saying right that thought damn Adam came the way God wanted all of his children to come are you listening Reed who is this Melchizedek had we come as Jesus Christ came we would have never been tempted and fallen so he had to I don't know what's the word for he had to lower down he had to drop down a notch he had to make a little difference between this and this I don't know what words to use I don't have no education you take a ninth grade education to try to tell people about thoughts and things and they lies - what if he nobody theophany I can read but are you listening Jesus came straight down the line through the word into Melchizedek and walked out on the earth in Jesus Christ now come on Adam didn't come this away and then drop down in another person and appear through this other person who didn't finally come on come on Adam came from attribute the thoughts of God as to what he would be he stepped into a wonderful position because when he said let us make man what a great position that would be talking about that a human mortal could comprehend think about even of being in the image of Almighty God but now watch him see Adam has got to come from attribute to flesh to be tempted right come on Jesus come straight across into flesh showing that he was Almighty God the whole time and he didn't matter what the temptation come he wasn't gonna fall now had even Adam been made that way Adam would not have fallen though Adam comes from attribute what is the attribute let us make my animal is that the displaying God's attributes is that is the attributes of God to be his children his offspring see we talk about attributes as being healer Savior etc well why not think about him as father you know father is one of the attributes right you know that son is one of the attributes of God brother branham said it he was to be son that was one of these attributes he was to be father that was one of the attributes he could have created Adam and been father he never made him wrong they'll never get that in your mind and he made him wrong well I can't help it that's what my brother said to Methodist preacher about twelve years of college he said God can't blame me for being wrong called he made me wrong I said he didn't make you like you are you made yourself like you are then you're blaming God for it that's not true but listen you come like Adam like me you become from the attribute to the flesh to be tempted I'm coming down to where we're getting to Adam see then attribute let us make man in our own image he made that man now listen that man that he made of Genesis 1:26 and 27 could not fall now don't get you hold man we got to go to Genesis 2:7 two-volume them a body we got to get something else involved into this after a while if we have time that one 26 and 27 within the image of God and God can't fall so there's no way to make that one 26 man fall well we've got work the Prophet said Adam fail that's right we'll get to that did Adam fall from eternal life if he did he went to hell now what do you got you go ahead you don't listen and you say well that's your idea well let's hear yours I'm open my doors never this now stuck about 3/4 closed any time you want to come in there and we'll talk about it cuz I'm gonna tell you what I believe and then you make up your mind whether or not that's the truth or not but listen jerk Adam came listen if God was the word right now come on you have to listen with me for a minute God was the word his first form from taking from eternity you know the beginning in the beginning that he was a quote right here in the beginning before the eternal that's that's in this who is this melchester and there he was he condescended to word a theophany word to create Jesus Christ you know became he was the word all right now if Adam was in the image of God what was that him created brother Brian calls him a spirit man can I call him this and get by with you on it he was a word man he was part of the word because he's part of God if he's in the image of God didn't why you got trouble with him being God in human flesh Adam was eternal life in his soul right blasphemous names we'll get to it eventually brother Brown said pre-breathe especially into Adam eternal life he became an eternal person with God now that's blasphemous names I've preached it forty years some of you ordered list you could holler Amen for forty years ago or something listen Adam this is what I'm trying to tell you you say well you're just saying the same thing over and over we just moved up a notch now did you move with me we just moved up a notch we just stepped up a step higher than we've ever preached before that Adam that man of one 26 or 27 was a spirit man in the image of God it was the world that Adam was to be now remember what I said Adam was God's original plan take away the fall take away all the things Adam would have been God's original plan for all the children of God to come forth which Adam would have been the one 26 man he was put over the garden to lead the animals he was in theophany now come on am i right page 80 the Hebrew book that's why your soul is your theophany but you ain't gonna listen to that you're gonna still hang to your old days of thinking what if the often he is and the soul is and you're not gonna listen but I'm gonna keep hollering until the day I die or lose my voice somebody's gonna get this this is 40 almost 50 years that I've been preaching this well I ain't worried about ain't you worried about somebody coming and challenge you it's out there on the internet come and show me where I'm wrong you said that's sarcastic no that ain't sarcastic that's just plain language code if I'm wrong and you tell me I'm wrong and show me where I'm wrong that I can be helped right so I can't lose see if I'm right then you're gonna be proved to be wrong but if I'm wrong and you correct me I'm gonna be proved to be wrong and I can get rid of it so I can't lose Thank You silly I agree with you but I enjoy it himself yeah what are you following me Adam came straight from attribute to flesh now come on Genesis 1:26 and 27 he was created as spiritual being eternal life 2:7 I guess it is right before that to seven to seven rather rather explained it they said what is the difference between the man of 1:26 and the man of 2:7 you remember that the question brethren said to 1:26 man would put in to the 2:7 man he breathed into the nostrils of a body that was created coming to flesh to be tempted he was put in that flash the 1:26 man the eternal life was put in that flat blasphemous nine brethren said it was eternal life that was breathed into his nostrils come on I've got it here no in the message anytime you want these things you just holler I'll be their blasphemous names take it for 180 for Jehovah Witness believe that a talking about a breathing that's your you breathe that you're like it's not what you breathe your soul cuz if that's what they believe they believe that you you breathe out you breathe in said an animal breathes out and breathe in so it's just a soul listen to what he says but what God did he breathed the breath of eternal life then he became a living soul a soul that can't die now remember that when brother Brown said Adam died and you'll see he's not telling you two different things could Adam never died and so he died in body listen now watch we're going to get into honey plum to our elbows notice breathe the breath of eternal life into the nostrils and he became an eternal soul cause God breathed not what nature buried but around called him in that an eternal ocean an eternal person but listen so Adam in his first creation as a spirit man was also the part of the word that he was to be this is for later okay this is maybe a dozen message down the road see you're part of one 26 and 27 is it as part of the scripture that you are how many times have I asked you the question many times if I said to you is there any one certain scripture that means more to you than the other scriptures and you know it's always odd is hardly ever there's hardly ever we ask it here one not two went through a whole group of people standing up and telling they're rich and hardly anybody quoted the same scripture because it's not to be what is your scripture weight says 1:26 and 27 here what's yours what's next you know mine don't you what let me never remember my scripture the thing God spoke to me about before I ever heard of this message before I ever heard of anything about it a good old formal bad dish and I went to my wife when I read Dawson I said well if I'm a Christian I need to be read the Bible his word I read the Bible and when I got over to Malachi 4 I read 3 and I read 4 and I went to my wife and I said according the way I read that's gonna be 2 prophets coming for the end of the world ok I couldn't get it straight so when brother Moute began to tell me about this prophet I said tell me where is that in the word he says it's Malachi folder well I wanted you know you heard me tell I wanted to see where he was going to so I said well what about this prophet in Malachi 3 because he's Elijah mill I got three me and I said you're talking about got four were explaining this guy he said oh that's John the Baptist and he said that's Luke 11730 that comes over here to the well at least I gotta listen to the guy what else could argue about what's your scripture I said we're talking about Adam but we'll get down to each individual be cold Adam was part of the word let us make man now I'll show you the secret before we ever get over to it the problem is you and I have got to have a new birth before we can talk about the one 26 and 27 right I said a little difference between this and a little difference between that so we're getting the whole plan of redemption but listen you come like Adam he said Adam came from watch now brother branham said Adam and Eve was one in theophany you remember that and the question is an answer you remember the eve was left in theophany and Adam was put in flesh and Eve was still in theophany questions and answers right then he said Adam was lonely he said then he took and said Eve was a part of Adam and theophany said she's part of Adam and now why can't you see what he's saying when he says your soul is your theophany when you step out of this body you don't step into another body that's transmigration heard of random emphatic mistakes in this church age book that he doesn't believe in transmigration transmigration means going from one body to another body he doesn't believe in it neither does he believe in reincarnation would you say what are you talking about I'm talking about a man named Adam that appeared on earth 6,000 years ago was God's original plan forever child that he was to ever have would have been that that would have been in the way every one of us would have come simple to me all he had to do was bring Adam and Eve blow the devil out of the way keep him off the same can't work ain't nothing it's brought Adam and Eve in in Adam and Eve could have whatever you want to bring the wordings you've used your own terminologies they would have brought us into being by the spoken word and as they did God would have put the part of the 1:26 man that you wish to be would have put that into you as eternal life in your soul and the Tree of Life was in the garden and we'd all went to the Tree of Life and our bodies would have been made eternal what the problem was it was already in two other tree the tree of death was put there because that was not going to come that away well get my point God's original plan plan plan for mankind was for every one of us to come like Adam did Adam could not fall from that eternal life in his soul but he was put in a body see I know what you're thinking you're saying I don't see how you can put eternal life in the soul and then let her body fall heaven help you any of you had a dirty thought today you ever had a little bit of heal something come up in you today did you lust after something today did you do anything like that come on be natural did you look at your wife this is bathing this morning in life tight to her come on you got sin then now do you understand what I'm trying to say a born-again believer is not a person set aside from sin when you do that you're in the devil's trap and he's got you oh I can't saying I'm a born-again Christian the devil's done got you deceived don't ever think you can't sin because that's what I had them done and Adam was the word remember Eve was deceived Adam wouldn't deceive he knew exactly what he's doing exactly what he was doing he was to see she still thought she's right don't ever think that you can't do wrong you're in the devil's trap well that wouldn't leave that was a devil oh wait a minute have you ever heard that one that wasn't me that was the devil well that means the devil's in you if it you've flipped it on you now where you got it you gonna put the devil in God's than you sold together no way folks come on don't ever think that you can't do wrong because that right there is the worst sin that there is is to think you can't do wrong as a Christian I don't know if no other sin would be greater than that that got killed in 58 people after the best thing he ever done he was the fifty-ninth one he just took his own life but a man doing that that ain't seeing according to your prophet now come on drinking gambling all this out in the other so killing people and all these other that's not sin the sin is sitting in the pews of the church thinking that you're not a sinner when you're turning down the world I thought sin was to disbelieve God's Word oh now you're getting technical brother Dale you're trying to make me afraid honey we lost being afraid a long time ago our children are not afraid of God because we've lost the point of trying to direct them as to be afraid of a Living God so now we're gonna have to pick up and we're gonna bring Adam some more and then we'll talk about how you can because remember we didn't come 1 26 and 27 mm-hmm let me state again in a hurry were to be Jesus Christ became the word there's the theophany --the the word there's the speech the logos to create her he stood there like I said if you've seen him standing he was standing looking like Hoffman's closed like brother branham's bit a man standing there saying let there be but see we look at him as a spirit or something no no no no no that's where you're wrong you say yeah but Abraham Abraham couldn't see the one that was dark I'm glad you thought of that then Abraham couldn't see the one that was there because he's inside of him I'm glad you thought of that but did you think that Moses he didn't appear to Moses as a man in a body to talk to him he talked to him from a burning bush or whatever he was talking and then moses said lord i wish i could see he said go stand in the rock and said when to do when i passed you can look and he said he saw the back part of my hand and he said that was the theophany that moses saw and that was the same body jesus was in when he walked the shores of Galilee see he came word first are you listening now Adam came the 126th man was only the part of the word that he was why listen why would brother Branham say Eve wasn't in Adam I mean Eve Eve was over here and had him was down here Eve was still up here nut the offing this way Adam was down here why because she's got her own word - she's part of the one 26 to 27 she's got her own word you got the word to be revealed and to get us off the hook what see you and I we had to bypass every bit of that we never come like Adam we never came from one 26 and 27 to flesh to be tempted that way we bypassed all of that we came to the world as sinners we got to get the new birth here now the 1:26 and 27 man is a part of you now we're going back towards eternal life now why can't you see that your soul is your theophany because the very time brother Branham is explaining Adam and Eve as the theophany and being herb here and him here he goes right on he says that's the reason he made demand he said because he was different from the animals and said he put a soul in a man he said cause that soul is this theophany when they went beyond come on musicians when he went beyond the curtain of time souls under the altar he said that was theophany why can't you see that your soul is your theophany why can't you see if you die you just step right out of that body and you going right onto something else right why can't we see these things because we don't think I'm going to say this and you can take what you want to we don't think that there's any man capable of telling us anything now after brother Branham will take that he can tell us cold we can argue over the quotes are you in me we take brother Branham and say he had it but that way you can argue over the quotes because you can say he said this and he said that he said isn't he said that but you don't think anybody today could speak the Word of God and it'd be rocked you say yeah but you're using hey I'm not talking about one or two people I'm talking about everybody in this church okay everybody in this church is that enough I'm talking about everybody because you don't believe that the man can bring you the Word of God I kind of think it's just what now who give you the right to think well that's just your way of seeing it we went through that and organized religion folks let's tan turn the page sorry to be a little you know I was I hope you see what I'm talking about we'll get to the point of you and I and our descending just remember Oh [Music] medieval Arab existed we come straight over [Music] going back away [Music] they died what about it [Music] one day [Music] [Applause] Gerard [Music] in Jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
