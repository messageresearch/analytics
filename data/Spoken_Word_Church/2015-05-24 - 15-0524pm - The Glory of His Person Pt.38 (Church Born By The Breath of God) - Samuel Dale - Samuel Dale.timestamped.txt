[6:45] time and a celebration time in the Lord
[6:49] man so let's just be much in prayer for
[6:52] those things remember those that are not

[6:57] different things and the ones that are
[6:58] traveling and everybody's going about
[7:00] the country now so we get their

[7:18] so let's let's see Ezekiel 37 right
[7:22] Revelations 1 Ezekiel 37. Lord Jesus we
[7:25] love you
[7:26] we thank you Father for all things
[7:30] we just ask you Lord that you would just
[7:32] come today and speak to our hearts that
[7:36] you'd give understanding to each and
[7:37] every one of us that we may walk in the
[7:40] light of Your Love
[7:41] because that's our desire and that's our
[7:43] thoughts
[7:45] what is it for the world what is it or
[7:47] anything out there that's worth anything
[7:50] it's all fastly going away
[7:52] but yet we know that your word is
[7:55] forever settled and we'll keep unfolding
[7:57] And We Praise Your Great Name God each
[8:00] one remember the sick ones Among Us
[8:02] and father remember the the ones that
[8:05] are traveling take care of everybody
[8:06] give a safe journey let your love be
[8:09] with each and every one and guide each
[8:12] one in Jesus name
[8:14] amen
[8:19] Revelations 1 I mean one
[8:23] and I turned to see the voice that spake
[8:26] with me and being turned I saw seven
[8:27] golden candlesticks in the midst of the
[8:30] seven candlesticks one like unto the son
[8:32] of man clothed with a garment down to
[8:34] the foot and gird about the pouch for
[8:36] the Golden Girl now remember I told you
[8:38] that we are preaching this scripture
[8:43] but we're using other things
[8:46] so you know you might wind up in but or
[8:50] to pay attention to the things that
[8:52] we're reading in the scripture because
[8:54] see now we're talking about when in
[8:57] missing the seven candlesticks one like
[9:00] unto the son of man well then we're
[9:01] going to Ezekiel
[9:03] all right so I would pay attention we
[9:05] made one of these days say well I'm
[9:07] finished with that and we'll go on you
[9:09] know
[9:10] but it says his head and his hairs were
[9:12] white like wool as white as snow in his
[9:15] eyes where's the flame of fire and his
[9:17] feet like undefined rice if they burned
[9:20] in a furnace in his voice as the sound
[9:22] of many Waters and we'll go to Ezekiel
[9:26] 34.
[9:28] he's talking about the Valley of the dry
[9:29] bones so he says in verse streak and
[9:32] these bones live and he said uh he said
[9:35] I know us
[9:36] verse 4 he says and again he said unto
[9:39] me prophesy upon these bones and say
[9:42] unto them
[9:44] oh you dry bones hear the word of the
[9:46] Lord
[9:47] thus saith the Lord God unto these bones
[9:49] behold I will cause breath to enter into
[9:51] you and ye shall live and I will lay sin
[9:54] you upon you and will bring up flesh
[9:56] upon you and cover you with skin and put
[9:58] breath in you and you shall live and you
[10:01] shall know that I am the Lord so I
[10:04] prophesied as I was commanded and as I
[10:06] prophesied there was a noise and Boulder
[10:09] shaking and the bones came together bone
[10:11] to his bone
[10:13] and when I beheld low this in you and
[10:16] the flesh Came Upon them and the skin
[10:18] covered them
[10:20] above but there was no breath in them
[10:22] then said he unto me prophesy unto the
[10:26] wind prophesy son of man and say to the
[10:30] wind thus saith the Lord God come from
[10:33] the Four Winds o breath and breathe upon
[10:36] these slain that they may live so I
[10:38] prophesied as he commanded me and the
[10:41] breath came into them and they lived and
[10:43] stood upon their feet and exceeding
[10:45] great Army so you may be seated the Lord
[10:49] had his Blessing to the reading of the
[10:51] word
[10:52] now to try to
[10:56] you know back up on her message this
[10:58] morning
[10:59] because we this is we'll put it in two
[11:02] parts but we titled the first part this
[11:04] morning
[11:05] Breath of God because that was what we
[11:07] were talking about
[11:09] and then we will put this one apart as
[11:12] Church
[11:13] born by the Breath of God
[11:16] because that's what we're talking about
[11:18] getting into
[11:20] this evening but did you follow me this
[11:24] morning to make sure because I don't
[11:25] want you to misunderstand so you can you
[11:29] try to make something hard for make
[11:31] people to see it and then they back away
[11:34] like I said I preached one day here for
[11:37] about an hour and a half on
[11:38] manifestation of the spirit and a
[11:41] brother went home to eat lunch with me
[11:43] and first thing he said you don't
[11:45] believe in manifestation do you
[11:48] and I've spent an hour and a half trying
[11:51] to show what I was talking about but see
[11:54] that's it's just what you get your mind
[11:56] locked and you know and then you'll wind
[12:00] up losing the entire point or thought of
[12:04] what somebody is saying so that's why I
[12:06] keep over it a lot of times over and
[12:08] over it so don't get in your mind that
[12:11] I'm not saying that God can
[12:15] like that and do things
[12:17] you know I'm not trying to emphasize
[12:21] that my point is emphasizing that
[12:24] whether he breathes
[12:27] he still has to speak
[12:31] that it's not just that he breathed
[12:34] he said something
[12:37] you remember there in John and we were
[12:39] talking about it and said you know and
[12:41] he breathed upon the disciples and said
[12:43] receive ye the Holy Ghost
[12:45] well see he said something
[12:48] the main thing is there's something to
[12:50] be said like I said about a a baby dog
[12:52] it'll come out it'll whine whine and do
[12:55] a little bark
[12:57] but he can't talk but then a baby it
[13:01] comes out you know and a baby and and
[13:03] it'll cry
[13:04] you don't have to teach a baby to cry
[13:06] it'll do it and take care of that
[13:09] but then you've got to teach it how to
[13:11] talk
[13:12] all right so then there's something
[13:14] about the vocal cords of mankind and the
[13:18] animal world that will work to a degree
[13:20] as the air flows across to make sounds
[13:23] and other things you know utter utter
[13:26] things and uh
[13:29] but what about something that can a
[13:31] human being that can talk
[13:34] see then if you really understand what
[13:36] I'm getting at it's the deeper meaning
[13:38] part of you that's doing the talking
[13:40] it's just like I said you don't see with
[13:42] your eyes
[13:43] all right
[13:44] you see from the inner part of your
[13:47] being
[13:48] and if God would ever allow you to do
[13:50] that he did me one time that he allowed
[13:53] me to walk back in my mind in my
[13:55] eyeballs and they just went like a
[13:57] telescope back and I seen a person as
[14:00] they were as he was looking at them
[14:03] I didn't see him with a condemnation
[14:04] that I had about that person
[14:06] I could see how he saw him
[14:09] you know because that was something that
[14:12] was related to me
[14:13] all right so then the the what causes
[14:16] you to be able to speak words would have
[14:19] to be something in a deeper meaning a
[14:21] part of you than to just be the spirit
[14:23] of mankind
[14:25] it would have to deal with your soul
[14:27] your being of what you are and and the
[14:31] person that's within you not somebody
[14:33] standing inside of you see that's what
[14:35] we think we get our minds old so many
[14:38] carnal thoughts and all until we miss
[14:41] the whole truth but what has been in our
[14:43] point that what you're born
[14:46] by the Breath of God is that what we
[14:48] want to get into the afternoon and begin
[14:50] to see and the God then
[14:54] did he breathe upon him
[14:57] see the wind that was coming in the uh
[15:00] Upper Room
[15:03] the wind that you know the Bible
[15:04] remember there was a great wind doing
[15:06] but that wasn't the new birth
[15:09] it was when that Lake of Fire set on
[15:12] each one of them
[15:15] and then that was where the word Was
[15:16] Made Alive
[15:18] and it wasn't just a wind blowing to
[15:19] make alive brother Joe uh brought it to
[15:22] my attention I'm glad to hear what other
[15:24] people think you know and uh he gave me
[15:28] a point that like in in Acts 2 and 2 uh
[15:32] it talks about the wind and you know
[15:35] look that up
[15:36] that means Breath of God
[15:38] would you look up the others and it'll
[15:40] just mean wind blowing
[15:42] it's only like I believe it was two he
[15:44] said in the Bible that relates to the
[15:46] Breath of God
[15:48] when you're using the word wind so then
[15:50] see look at it and try to see what I'm
[15:53] talking about more than the words that I
[15:55] use because I don't have that education
[15:57] I'm sorry I don't I try to put it as
[16:00] best as I can to help you to understand
[16:03] but see I believe you are born by the
[16:06] word
[16:07] that has been planted in you
[16:11] by someone you know
[16:14] that you heard the word
[16:17] even if it was reading the Bible you
[16:19] heard the word someone put that there
[16:22] and that goes within you and it becomes
[16:25] part of that inward being that we call a
[16:28] soul being a part of us
[16:30] and then when the Holy Spirit quickens
[16:32] that word it makes that word alive right
[16:35] around and said the Holy Ghost is in
[16:37] there waiting on you to bring him the
[16:38] word
[16:39] but he said when he brought when you
[16:41] bring him the word
[16:43] he can make it alive
[16:45] all right but what if we don't bring him
[16:47] the word
[16:49] you know what if we try to bring him
[16:51] everything else or what if we try to
[16:53] bring him incorrect word
[16:55] you know perverted word
[16:57] the seed word of mankind
[17:00] ideas of doctrines and opinions
[17:04] that's why it's so important the prophet
[17:06] said of the word that was planted
[17:10] all right
[17:11] and if he was so uh you know so set on
[17:15] that as being serious about it why
[17:17] shouldn't we be
[17:20] well brother Dale you don't have to make
[17:21] it so God can just do what he wants to
[17:24] that's right he can just leave us
[17:27] sitting in our little pity Patty hold
[17:30] and just go on off and let us go and be
[17:33] justified in doing it
[17:35] because we are the ones that pull
[17:37] ourselves back in those holes and and
[17:39] doings in the things of Life all right
[17:43] now so what is the New Birth the birth
[17:45] of the word
[17:47] the words you've held
[17:49] it becomes in that inner being of that
[17:52] soul that we are
[17:54] and that Soul as I told you it takes
[17:56] remember the message the other day we've
[17:58] been our soul has been molding all of
[18:00] our life
[18:02] because soul is what you are person
[18:04] being heart whatever you want to call
[18:07] the wording that's what you are but it's
[18:10] that character that nature that doings
[18:13] it has been being molded within us all
[18:16] of our lives
[18:18] and you know that's where God begins to
[18:20] work because he doesn't work on the body
[18:22] he doesn't work on the spirit that's
[18:24] where it couldn't be understood if you
[18:26] worked on the body and the spirit then
[18:28] Abraham and them had it because Abraham
[18:30] walked with God
[18:31] you know Abraham was called a friend of
[18:34] God David in his worst things was called
[18:37] a man after God's Own Heart that's right
[18:39] but see there was no way to get that
[18:41] that word in their soul to be made alive
[18:44] they're understanding that remember this
[18:46] morning their understanding of a certain
[18:49] way or whatever God wanted to reveal for
[18:51] the time and the doings that could be
[18:55] done
[18:56] all right so the disciples remember
[18:59] he opened their understanding we read it
[19:01] there in Luke he opened their
[19:03] understanding of the word
[19:06] he breathed on them John is putting the
[19:08] two together John and Luke would be
[19:09] saying the same
[19:11] that in Luke it says he opened her
[19:13] understanding and told him to go away to
[19:15] Pentecost he breathed on them in John 20
[19:18] and said receive ye the Holy Ghost but
[19:21] that was a promise
[19:23] they couldn't get it right then because
[19:24] Jesus had not been crucified and not
[19:26] been glorified
[19:28] all right so there was no way for that
[19:30] to take place it had to wait until he
[19:32] could come inside to where it would be
[19:34] an under an inside teacher to understand
[19:37] the word of God all right see then in
[19:41] doing that
[19:44] we see that it is truly the birth of the
[19:46] word
[19:48] the birth of what we hear
[19:50] all right we believe too that what we're
[19:53] saying at the end there that what that
[19:56] the seed comes through the body
[19:59] it does in the natural it comes to the
[20:01] body to the you know the the quickening
[20:03] of the egg
[20:05] of the female that she produces that
[20:07] brings the body
[20:08] all right but it comes through
[20:12] spiritual multiplication
[20:16] is what we're doing right now I mean the
[20:18] preaching of the Gospel is spiritual
[20:19] multiplication it's planting of the seed
[20:22] and that that's why I've tried even to
[20:24] tell you the natural part you look at it
[20:26] and you see why so many preachers run
[20:28] off after polygamies and different
[20:30] things because they're dealing with the
[20:32] word of God that is a seed
[20:35] and the first thing you know it just
[20:37] goes from one seed to another seed to
[20:39] another seed and the first thing you
[20:41] know they're off into polygamy
[20:43] why because it's sowing a seed
[20:46] preaching the gospel is sowing the seed
[20:49] all right
[20:50] but see
[20:52] what are we talking about
[20:54] he breathed on them and said receive ye
[20:56] the Holy Ghost a promise go to the upper
[20:59] room and wait a promise
[21:01] all right one day that promise was
[21:04] fulfilled
[21:06] on the death Pentecost where the holy
[21:07] ghost coming
[21:09] all right then we went back to Ezekiel
[21:11] that we just read
[21:13] and Ezekiel gives you the same layout
[21:16] for the for the Jews coming the
[21:19] Israelite as what we receive
[21:22] the coming because
[21:24] you know it had been eaten away
[21:27] in the Gentile dispensation we covered
[21:29] it go to to Restoration of the Bride
[21:31] tree where it was four messengers of
[21:33] death Cancun Locust caterpillar they ate
[21:36] the bride down
[21:38] all right then it started back in
[21:39] Luther's justification Wesley
[21:41] sanctification Pentecostal baptism of
[21:44] the Holy Ghost but then the word
[21:47] all right then you can see where
[21:49] everything is perfectly in order
[21:52] in that way don't do away with none of
[21:54] these believe it Luther's message was
[21:57] right Wesley's message was right the
[21:59] Pentecostal message was right it wasn't
[22:02] just gifts
[22:03] but that's what everybody well Luther
[22:05] didn't know nothing
[22:07] but oh you got it all
[22:10] well where'd you get it
[22:12] if you don't have something put a
[22:14] foundation home
[22:17] hey the prophets built the body
[22:20] right but you know what they put it on a
[22:23] foundation of Abraham Isaac Jacob and
[22:25] Joseph right the Patriarchs
[22:29] then the prophets could build the body
[22:31] without the foundation where are you
[22:33] going to set it
[22:34] all right
[22:36] so then we take Luther Wesley Pentecost
[22:40] justification sanctification the baptism
[22:43] on the Holy Ghost that's why I said it
[22:44] so tricky right in that form until
[22:47] people will lose what you're saying
[22:49] because there's only three stages to
[22:51] life
[22:53] right
[22:55] justifications same case of baptism of
[22:57] the Holy Ghost water and blood spirit
[23:00] all right but then when you come to
[23:02] Restoration
[23:04] you go to four stages
[23:08] because you come to
[23:10] Azusa Street Pentecost
[23:13] right which Mary represented that
[23:16] because she was a carrier of the word
[23:20] but see Jesus wasn't a carrier
[23:23] amen
[23:25] and we're supposed to come to a position
[23:27] in the last days to not be carriers of
[23:29] the word but to be the word not to just
[23:32] talk about the word
[23:35] or even sympathize brother random said
[23:37] with it
[23:39] we are to be the word
[23:41] well all right now that's why that we
[23:44] ended up talking about it we'll drop
[23:46] back a little bit but try to move up
[23:48] where I don't lose you
[23:50] someone click on and don't don't hear
[23:52] what we're saying
[23:55] all right there had to be a prophet sent
[24:00] because where are you going to get
[24:02] Ezekiel in order
[24:03] if a prophet is not to come in the last
[24:05] days remember to Ezekiel what was it son
[24:08] of man prophesy
[24:11] if son of man hadn't spoke to the wind
[24:13] the wind would have blowed
[24:16] bone wouldn't have come to Bone had it
[24:19] not been because of the word of Ezekiel
[24:24] all right
[24:27] what did the prophet is trying to
[24:29] explain
[24:30] you had the Israelites the Jew
[24:34] all right and you had the Samaritan
[24:37] which would Hive to you and I Gentile
[24:39] and Jesus went to both of them
[24:42] you remember the woman at the Wells he
[24:43] was a Samaritan but he never carried the
[24:46] Messiah Ministry to the Gentiles
[24:51] now come on get your Bible and read it
[24:52] show me where he did so he never went
[24:55] the prophet said to the Gentiles
[24:57] that Peter opened the door to the
[24:59] Gentiles
[25:01] in the book of Acts yes
[25:04] but never did they receive the Messiah
[25:07] Ministry because that is the ministry of
[25:09] this on a man
[25:11] that's why Jesus was called that see he
[25:13] had the resurrection Ministry
[25:16] he had the Messiah Ministry
[25:19] all right son of man
[25:21] okay then that son of man see
[25:25] could speak
[25:26] and that's what he was doing in John 20.
[25:30] he was speaking to them not breathing
[25:35] you know I don't know what he said
[25:37] because he just blowed
[25:40] now you know what he's saying
[25:43] the Bible said
[25:45] he said receive ye the Holy Ghost
[25:48] all right Ezekiel was told to prophesy
[25:51] but you know what he was told you say
[25:54] what I'm telling you to say
[25:57] right right
[25:59] and he prophesied under the wind and
[26:01] attack you know it wouldn't have come
[26:03] that's the restoration of Israel right
[26:05] Ezekiel the Valley of the dry bones
[26:07] Israel will be restored one day back to
[26:10] the position they're supposed to be
[26:12] but they will never get to come back
[26:14] into sonship
[26:16] as the bride of Christ he is that will
[26:18] come back in as servants to the bride
[26:21] but they receive the same message that
[26:24] we do which is this message
[26:26] but it'll be through two prophets to
[26:29] them
[26:31] there won't be just this Prophet taken
[26:33] over to Israel and they get converted
[26:35] they they don't go with it
[26:38] they go with a live Ministry
[26:42] remember it would have been very
[26:44] dangerous had he went to Israel
[26:47] with a mosaic sign that he had
[26:49] because that Israelite was trained to
[26:51] believe that
[26:53] and see that's why he didn't get to go
[26:55] wrong people
[26:57] all right but see here in the end time
[27:00] he was to be to you and I
[27:03] his whole message that's what I I love
[27:06] the message see to me the message is the
[27:10] voice of God
[27:13] speaking to you and I
[27:16] why don't you listen to the message like
[27:18] that you might get encouraged to listen
[27:20] sometime
[27:21] you got plenty of time to do everything
[27:23] else
[27:25] oh whatever I just brother Dale I just
[27:28] don't have a time like you
[27:35] we used to listen to tape so much until
[27:37] the neighbors kids would be up playing
[27:39] one of them was saying here a while back
[27:41] talking away he said yep I used to be up
[27:43] there said we'd be in there playing I
[27:45] said they'd be in there have a tape
[27:46] playing
[27:50] they'd be the kids would be in the other
[27:51] room playing
[27:53] we'd be playing a tape
[27:55] now I'm not to the point of saying you
[27:57] got to play them 24 hours a day
[28:00] there's people that do that brother used
[28:01] to come here a good bit I won't call his
[28:03] name but they said that's the way they
[28:05] done one of the brothers in the family
[28:07] you know what they played tapes 24 hours
[28:09] a day in their home that's all right I
[28:11] ain't saying a word about it
[28:13] I'm just saying you don't have to do it
[28:14] that way
[28:15] but you ought to know more about that
[28:17] and your kids ought to know about Jesus
[28:19] Christ and brother Branham instead of
[28:21] the world and all that's on TVs and all
[28:24] this on videos and all its own other
[28:27] things
[28:29] they ought to know more about that than
[28:31] they do about those things
[28:33] all right and we're responsible remember
[28:36] what we let them little Minds listen to
[28:40] is our responsibility
[28:42] all right
[28:44] but you see if you see it that way
[28:46] you'll see one God had to send us a
[28:48] prophet amen see there had to be a
[28:50] prophet sitting the last day because it
[28:52] see that's why I brought around him then
[28:54] he could come with the son of man part
[28:55] speaking and how the resurrection
[28:57] Ministry the discernments the gifts the
[29:00] signs and wonders would work in a man's
[29:02] life why because he was coming back as
[29:04] to be what a son of man
[29:08] that the son of man the Lord Jesus
[29:10] Christ was coming down and speaking
[29:13] through him to you and I
[29:16] amen why wouldn't you want to hear
[29:18] your husband
[29:21] speaking to you
[29:27] right
[29:29] you don't think about the message like
[29:31] that
[29:34] that's my God that's my husband I ain't
[29:36] talking about the the man that divorce
[29:39] is being used
[29:40] I'm talking about the word he's bringing
[29:43] remember it ain't you
[29:45] talking about
[29:48] it's the word that's being brought unto
[29:51] us
[29:54] why wouldn't we be concerned with
[29:55] hearing what our husband would have to
[29:58] say maybe we don't care that much about
[30:00] the husband
[30:04] okay
[30:06] put it in there and forget it
[30:09] but listen
[30:12] see if it had not have been trying to
[30:15] back up a little this morning but yet
[30:17] moving on just a little bit into the
[30:19] thought
[30:22] the Lord Jesus went to the Jews and went
[30:24] to the Samaritans but he didn't go to
[30:26] the Gentiles all right that would be
[30:28] left until the last days
[30:32] to where God would come in the last days
[30:35] and bring the message
[30:39] to you and I
[30:40] now if it's true
[30:43] what I've tried to emphasize all the
[30:46] since I heard the message
[30:48] that I don't believe anybody's ever been
[30:51] born again and didn't hear the word
[30:52] first
[30:53] now if you show me how you can do that
[30:56] then I'll just quit preaching because
[30:57] ain't no need of it
[31:02] Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[31:05] what
[31:06] I want a red and Playboy I played I mean
[31:09] I read I I read the news and I read that
[31:11] and you know I really got a revelation
[31:12] from Reading there
[31:14] I'm sure you did
[31:17] you might not want to tell nobody what
[31:19] it is because it might be embarrassing
[31:25] right
[31:28] but what about it
[31:29] if the new birth is the birth of the
[31:31] word
[31:34] why wouldn't we want to hear the word
[31:38] why would we not be interested in
[31:40] hearing the word because to me that's
[31:42] God breathing unto you and I am if you
[31:45] understand the emphasis I'm trying to
[31:47] make instead of the
[31:49] I'm talking about a message that we hear
[31:53] right not just a wind blowing
[31:56] but that's all everybody can do they
[31:58] don't want to talk about the message go
[32:02] you know that brother Branham on so and
[32:04] so and so and so so and so everybody
[32:06] tell you that to the letter can't you
[32:08] where brother random was standing the
[32:09] wind was blowing his pants was moving
[32:11] the curtains was moving I believe in
[32:14] that thank God I believe in it
[32:16] but where did that convert anybody
[32:22] but you don't want to hear about well I
[32:27] I know what the new birth is
[32:31] well that's what you're doing you're
[32:33] waiting on some kind of moving of the
[32:35] Wind
[32:37] you're waiting on some sign or some
[32:39] wonder that you can put it on and say
[32:42] that's my evidence
[32:44] and brother Dale Tires away every one of
[32:46] them
[32:48] by preaching that it's just the opening
[32:51] of the word
[32:53] it's not to shout and it's not the crime
[32:55] it's not the those are After Effects
[32:58] I've never done away with none of that I
[33:01] believe in those emotional things
[33:05] but put Christ first and then the
[33:07] emotions come second may I quote brother
[33:09] random don't jump too high but you can't
[33:12] walk straight when you come down
[33:15] right that's right
[33:17] so what is it then Jesus said receive ye
[33:20] the Holy Ghost
[33:22] but they didn't get it right there
[33:25] they had to wait
[33:27] to The Upper Room experience came which
[33:30] now let me put it this way
[33:33] you remember he was seen as the Bible
[33:35] said of over 500 Brethren acts of
[33:37] Resurrection
[33:39] but 120 dogs made it up a room 380
[33:41] didn't make it
[33:43] so evidently 380
[33:45] didn't hold on to the word
[33:49] right yet they seen
[33:52] the great things
[33:53] and I'm not going to say they didn't
[33:55] have their understanding open of the
[33:57] word as to who they were
[33:59] I mean who he was
[34:04] gonna see one of these days the Jews
[34:06] their understanding going to be open
[34:08] that's right
[34:10] to who this Messiah really is
[34:14] you know they're going to see the Christ
[34:17] then they're going to know the word of
[34:19] God of the Old Testament is right and
[34:21] the New Testament is perfect to bring
[34:23] that same Christ to them in the way it
[34:26] would come
[34:28] all right
[34:29] as I said this morning not that we're
[34:31] going to take this message over there
[34:33] you know
[34:37] look this message has been in Israel
[34:39] since back in the 60s
[34:43] brother Perry green and then was in the
[34:47] the you know this this Brothers you know
[34:49] I'm not throwing those stones I'm just
[34:51] saying like it is all right the brothers
[34:53] that came here said there ain't no
[34:54] message Church in Israel
[34:57] anyone over there and starting one well
[34:59] thank God all right
[35:01] but brother Perry green and him had this
[35:03] message on the news media
[35:06] with pictures of brother branham's the
[35:09] fire and what he was saying about Israel
[35:14] back in the 60s or 70s right in there
[35:20] at one time were head of the uh some
[35:23] kind of a dry good something or material
[35:26] under this the people that went from
[35:27] Tucson over there
[35:29] it was a great group of people over
[35:31] there
[35:32] right
[35:34] you're Brother Ray he's been around long
[35:35] enough to know it
[35:37] they were over there
[35:39] they know this message
[35:42] one thing I appreciate about what that
[35:44] that uh
[35:46] Rabbi Richmond either said it or the the
[35:49] guy that was in Israel with one or the
[35:51] other I'm thinking it was the God but he
[35:53] said we put the Bible on the desk of the
[35:58] children
[36:01] you're probably said
[36:03] and said we teach them from your Bible
[36:10] in the United States you can't even
[36:11] bring a Bible to school
[36:16] I know
[36:18] I'm still too old and too sad I know
[36:21] I still say when they bombed that Tower
[36:24] and the next day they had all them great
[36:26] big senators and great big Gods wanted
[36:28] to make themselves look something
[36:30] standing out in front of the Temple of
[36:32] the temp temple Australia
[36:35] what else or which one it was and they
[36:38] were singing and praying the order
[36:40] arrested every one of them
[36:43] bro
[36:45] why they broke the law
[36:48] they were the ones that said we can't
[36:50] pray in school
[36:51] nor everyone been arrested
[36:54] I know I don't sit too good that's all
[36:56] right
[36:57] would you tell me if that ain't true
[37:03] but listen Church
[37:05] can you see why we had to have a prophet
[37:08] it wasn't just that we well we believe
[37:11] in a prophet coming you know well what
[37:14] do y'all believe different to us well we
[37:16] believe this we all just believe a
[37:17] prophet comes I don't believe a prophet
[37:20] just come
[37:22] listen to what I'm saying I believe God
[37:25] sent a prophet
[37:30] I believe that's Ezekiel I believe
[37:32] that's all of it
[37:34] all of that Bible spoke that there'd be
[37:37] a man coming in last days they would
[37:39] have the word of God
[37:42] it wouldn't make the man nothing
[37:45] it didn't make Moses anything
[37:48] because of what he done and things
[37:53] but the word
[37:54] would never been brought to us Gentiles
[37:59] what do you mean brother we had the
[38:01] Bible
[38:03] we've had the Bible and and you talk
[38:05] like that we don't have nothing
[38:07] they never said that
[38:10] why would you come up with that idea
[38:13] I believe it Luther's justification I
[38:16] believe in Wesley's sanctification the
[38:18] truth of it now I believe it in baptism
[38:20] of the Holy Ghost I believe in the
[38:22] Methodist the Presbyterian
[38:24] the one that says neptunus isn't the
[38:27] fourness isn't
[38:28] I believe all of them had word
[38:33] don't deny any of them
[38:36] you better remember that the church from
[38:39] the start out of the of the day of
[38:41] Pentecost was a Catholic Church
[38:44] oh
[38:46] it was yeah because it was a universal
[38:51] the word back dire was Catholic meant
[38:53] Universal he didn't mean Roman
[38:57] it became Roman later
[38:59] it was Universal
[39:02] it's what your Prophet saying now
[39:06] he said they say well the Catholic
[39:08] church was written he said that's
[39:09] exactly right I'm an original Catholic
[39:15] but oh no we don't like that talking do
[39:17] we
[39:17] but listen
[39:22] he opened the understanding of their
[39:24] scriptures
[39:26] so that they would have something that
[39:29] the Holy Ghost could come upon
[39:33] maybe that's where the 380 didn't make
[39:35] it
[39:36] maybe they're understanding I said well
[39:38] I go I ain't said it they didn't do it
[39:39] but I ain't saying they did so maybe
[39:41] they didn't get their understanding open
[39:44] you know sometimes somebody has to talk
[39:46] to you a little bit about it to get your
[39:48] understanding open
[39:51] and then God can reveal it
[39:55] but what about trying to open
[39:56] understanding of mankind to us instead
[40:00] of the word of God
[40:06] maybe that's enough backup to get you to
[40:08] understand what I'm meaning to the fact
[40:11] that Ezekiel is saying to Israel
[40:16] the same as
[40:18] it is in John
[40:20] it is in Luke it is in the Bible
[40:24] that he would open an understanding of
[40:26] their scriptures to them and then he
[40:28] would send the Holy Ghost upon them
[40:31] and that would start
[40:33] the church
[40:35] in every new birth ever since then would
[40:37] have to come from the word being planted
[40:40] first
[40:41] and the Holy Spirit quickening the word
[40:43] or making it alive all right and that
[40:47] would make every Church age with the
[40:49] baptism of the Holy Ghost and that would
[40:51] make every individual with the same
[40:57] what
[41:00] we've all got this thing what was I
[41:02] emphasizing there the other day
[41:05] we've all got the same evidence
[41:10] no matter what age you see and where it
[41:12] is it's got the same evidence what's
[41:13] going to be the evidence of the Holy
[41:15] Ghost to Israel
[41:17] same thing
[41:18] whether the spirit of God in you agrees
[41:21] with the word
[41:22] right that's the same evidence everybody
[41:25] gets the same all right now
[41:30] but has our has our man I'm trying to
[41:33] get a point now to watch and then we'll
[41:34] move up
[41:36] as our understanding of the scriptures
[41:40] been opened enough until God could speak
[41:43] to us
[41:49] and our understanding been opened enough
[41:53] that we could receive a message from God
[42:00] now what if you're trinitarian sitting
[42:02] out under a tree and all you've ever
[42:03] been taught is trinitarianism all you
[42:05] ever believed was three gods and things
[42:06] and God dropped down and he said I'm one
[42:11] my name's one
[42:13] well now you wouldn't understand what
[42:15] he's talking about right
[42:16] you'd probably accuse it as being the
[42:18] devil that was talking to you
[42:21] right
[42:23] because you'd say I don't understand
[42:24] that
[42:27] so if nothing else to do at Lula Georgia
[42:29] I have tried
[42:32] for 50 years almost
[42:34] to our understanding to be open of the
[42:38] scriptures
[42:39] because that's all I can do
[42:41] I cannot give you the Holy Ghost
[42:43] random couldn't give you the Holy Ghost
[42:45] and Jesus said even my own life didn't
[42:48] reveal it
[42:49] it takes a holy ghost to reveal the word
[42:52] but if I can be the one to be used to
[42:55] plant the seed
[42:56] all right
[42:59] that's between you and God
[43:03] okay
[43:04] now what have we dealt on
[43:07] I'm trying to tie something together the
[43:09] word will come out
[43:11] in a minute in the way you'll see it
[43:15] what have we been trying to talk about
[43:19] not that man has a soul
[43:24] but that's what he is
[43:26] a being he's a person that's the real
[43:29] you it's the soul that's within you
[43:32] we're not true with all of that but
[43:33] we'll you know we'll keep on moving
[43:37] and that Soul within you
[43:40] according to the prophet on the message
[43:43] oh
[43:45] souls in prison
[43:48] paragraph 36 which is number nine if
[43:51] they want to get to it and pull that up
[43:52] I mean excuse me number eight
[43:54] number eight and we're gonna pull that
[43:57] up before we do seven because I had to
[43:58] move the message a little
[44:00] and what does he say
[44:03] okay
[44:04] there's where you know he's talking
[44:06] about how that it wasn't the body died
[44:08] with it and the nature of your spirit is
[44:10] dead and the nature of your soul is God
[44:13] if you're born again if not it's of the
[44:15] world okay now watch anything begin has
[44:19] to end so therefore the only way that
[44:20] you can have eternal life is to have a
[44:23] life that never did begin
[44:25] in your life did begin when you were
[44:29] born what when God breathed the breath
[44:32] of life into your nostrils and you
[44:35] became a living Soul then you begin then
[44:38] right
[44:40] so whenever babies born
[44:44] see up here he's defining the other here
[44:48] he's defining that sure in your life did
[44:51] begin when you were born when God
[44:53] breathed the Breath of Life
[44:54] every baby's ever born in the world had
[44:57] to have the Breath of Life breathing
[44:58] into their nostrils right
[45:02] that's why there's a lot stillborns
[45:04] why
[45:06] you think God don't know
[45:10] do you think their souls setting up in
[45:12] cubby holes somewhere
[45:14] that didn't get to be delivered Down to
[45:16] Earth because God forgot about some
[45:21] a stillborn baby that's not no no life
[45:24] it's when it's born
[45:26] don't you think God knew yet there's a
[45:28] life there yet there's wiggling muscles
[45:30] there's all kind of things taking place
[45:33] don't you think God knows whether that
[45:35] soul is going to receive life or not
[45:40] so when you're naturally born he
[45:42] breathes the breath of life into your
[45:43] nostrils and you become a living soul
[45:48] I can even show you and I believe it
[45:50] where brother Branham says that you
[45:53] become a living Soul at the age of
[45:54] accountability
[46:00] see I try to study a lot of things but I
[46:01] try not to bring so much because I know
[46:03] that I bring a whole lot and I get you
[46:05] confused and reading into right around
[46:07] and said when you reach the age of
[46:08] accountability then it's when you become
[46:11] a living soul
[46:13] you know why you have just raised up to
[46:16] a point
[46:17] to your accountable then
[46:20] before then you were a living soul
[46:23] as a baby
[46:25] but not held accountable
[46:29] all right
[46:31] you don't have to wait at the end he
[46:32] ain't explaining you got to wait till
[46:33] then become a living soul
[46:35] he's just expressing it that that you
[46:38] know to me that when you come up to that
[46:40] age of accountability then you start
[46:43] being responsible for the things of life
[46:46] and the doings and you're becoming into
[46:49] a living stage
[46:53] accountable to God
[46:55] through your own life
[46:57] huh
[46:59] we see you become a living soul
[47:01] when you're born into the world
[47:05] but see remember now Adam was a little
[47:08] different
[47:11] because Adam received eternal life
[47:15] when he breathed into his nostrils and
[47:16] he become a living Soul he had an
[47:19] eternal life
[47:21] we don't get eternal life when he
[47:23] breathes into our nostrils as a baby
[47:26] now let me say if I can find it it's on
[47:29] anointed one at the end time or in north
[47:32] at not where he says that our life is
[47:35] permitted of God
[47:37] permitted
[47:39] all right God permitted our life to come
[47:42] because of the Fallen conditions
[47:44] so he permits every baby that's in the
[47:46] world
[47:47] their life to come into them as a living
[47:50] soul
[47:51] there was a lot of bit a lot of
[47:53] difference about Adam because Adam
[47:55] started off full grown and fully doings
[47:59] and all in it and then God breathed into
[48:00] his nostrils and he become
[48:02] an eternal person
[48:05] with God
[48:06] because he breathed into him eternal
[48:08] life let's take a few quotes because I
[48:10] want to get this to be able to do it go
[48:12] back to number seven now which is uh
[48:14] should be paragraph 184 through 187 of
[48:17] blasphemius names
[48:20] all right
[48:23] now here are your Jehovah Witness in
[48:25] their book it says it's a breath that
[48:26] you breathe it's a soul
[48:28] now he's explaining that he doesn't
[48:30] agree with that
[48:31] the breath you breathe
[48:34] all right now to express the difference
[48:38] of word that you'll see he's explaining
[48:40] it is what I said this morning and say
[48:42] it again
[48:48] why is not words coming off of my vocal
[48:51] cords
[48:56] because I'm just breathing
[49:01] but by being a soul within me that's not
[49:04] within the animal
[49:07] I can use my vocal cords to form words
[49:10] because remember
[49:13] sinner or Saint we're in the image of
[49:15] God
[49:17] right
[49:19] so we can use our vocal cords to talk to
[49:21] one another Communications all right so
[49:24] watch what he's saying now
[49:25] see the breath that you breathe is not
[49:27] soul
[49:30] till you understand the breath you
[49:32] breathe is not the soul soul Jesus
[49:34] didn't go
[49:35] he spoke to him
[49:39] he spoke from his inner being out to
[49:41] bring the word to them
[49:43] follow him now
[49:44] in your your time your see if you've
[49:46] done that then uh time you'd be one kind
[49:49] of a soul next time you'd be somebody
[49:51] else
[49:52] see we'd be breathing every time I'd
[49:54] breathe out you breathe in my soul will
[49:56] be going to you and yours and me no
[49:57] that's not it
[49:59] get it straight that's not the way it
[50:01] goes next time you're somebody else
[50:04] let's breathe that soul look where you'd
[50:06] be now the breath is wind and wind is
[50:09] what you breathe into your nostrils
[50:11] now they take the scripture from back
[50:13] and God breathed breath into the
[50:16] nostrils and he became a living Soul now
[50:19] I want to ask you something if he was a
[50:22] man what kind of a breath was he
[50:23] breathing before God breathed his breath
[50:25] of life into him see what kind of a
[50:27] breath he was a breathing living man
[50:29] well then if that be so then every
[50:31] animal is a living Soul because they
[50:33] breathe the human soul and our soul and
[50:36] all together then Jesus wouldn't have
[50:38] had to Die the animal sacrifice would
[50:41] have been sufficient see so brother the
[50:44] argument don't stand but what get did
[50:47] God did he breathed the breath of
[50:50] eternal life amen
[50:52] then he became a living Soul who into
[50:54] Adam right
[50:56] a soul that can't die
[50:58] now I've explained we don't all get that
[51:00] now that was him but Jesus got it Adam
[51:03] got it
[51:05] coach Adam is the first Adam and Jesus
[51:07] is the second Adam
[51:09] the first Adam was the living Soul the
[51:11] second Adam was The Lord Of Glory
[51:13] that's the scripture
[51:15] all right so Jesus when he was born he
[51:18] just didn't get a natural life he would
[51:19] hit that soul that came into him was
[51:21] eternal life
[51:22] all right so it with Adam
[51:25] then he become a living Soul a soul that
[51:27] can't die now watch we're going to get
[51:29] into honey Plum to our elbows notice
[51:31] breathe the breath of life into his
[51:33] nostrils and he become an eternal Soul
[51:35] because God breathed not what nature
[51:38] done
[51:39] so he now what's he defining nature is
[51:41] what brings life into you
[51:43] all right comes from God with his nature
[51:45] but what God did breathe the breath of
[51:48] life into his nostrils and he became a
[51:50] living soul
[51:52] you said what Adam died but remember
[51:54] Adam had a redeemer because already in
[51:57] his nostrils had become the breath of
[51:59] Eternal of the Eternal God how could
[52:01] Adam be lost
[52:03] and you become a living Soul he was the
[52:04] son of God not his breath as the African
[52:07] word I don't know what the Greek word
[52:10] for it is right now but the African word
[52:12] they call it a Moya which means the wind
[52:14] an unseen Force animals breathe the more
[52:16] your Sinners breathe the more you then
[52:18] why would we struggle for eternal life
[52:20] if that's the Eternal Soul breathe into
[52:23] us by breath why would you struggle for
[52:25] eternal life it backs first brother it
[52:27] just don't do but God especially upon
[52:29] Adam breathed the breath of eternal life
[52:30] and he became an eternal person with God
[52:32] he had power With God all right
[52:35] now
[52:37] he breathed into Adam
[52:40] eternal life
[52:43] all right he breathed into Jesus Christ
[52:47] eternal life
[52:48] but the rest of us all come natural-born
[52:51] people with the Breath of Life
[52:54] permitted of God to come that we would
[52:58] be alive and be a living soul
[53:01] but then when you're born again
[53:06] he breathes the breath of eternal life
[53:08] into your soul right
[53:11] and you become an eternal person with
[53:13] God right
[53:15] born by the Breath of God
[53:18] all right
[53:20] what about it
[53:21] look at number nine
[53:24] paragraph 235-237 the blasphemus 9.
[53:30] let me
[53:31] let me read 234 I forgot to pull this
[53:35] one off
[53:37] and have it somewhere
[53:39] all right now I didn't give him this so
[53:40] we'll wait till we get down to it but
[53:42] it'll tie us together paragraph 232
[53:44] we're jumping to 235 so remember that if
[53:47] they want to roll it backwards I don't
[53:48] know how where they can handle that but
[53:50] watch right around and says church is
[53:52] the mystical Body of Christ born of the
[53:55] Breath of God oh did you get it
[53:57] congregation says amen the Church of God
[54:00] is born of the Breath of God God
[54:03] breathes breath into the nostril
[54:05] spiritually of Adam and he became a
[54:07] living Soul did you know the
[54:09] Pentecostals are the true Pentecostal
[54:11] church is born of the Breath of God
[54:19] it's the only day of Pentecost is the
[54:21] Breath of God
[54:22] breathe into the soul of those people
[54:25] all right bring it on down see where it
[54:27] now what is it Church born to the Breath
[54:30] of God now watch him he's going all the
[54:33] way till he takes it all the way up the
[54:34] pyramid
[54:37] when this stature was molded itself up
[54:40] there in condition God breathed breathed
[54:43] breaths upon them receive ye the Holy
[54:46] Ghost then you're a Son of God now watch
[54:49] him you could join anything you want to
[54:50] then
[54:52] well I've had people throw that in my
[54:54] mouth I mean my faith well the rest said
[54:56] you can join any church you want to
[54:59] you ain't never had nobody to throw that
[55:00] at you
[55:01] right around and said you go anywhere
[55:03] you want to
[55:05] I said right
[55:07] exactly right
[55:09] agree with what he said but you just
[55:11] don't know the rest of what he's saying
[55:13] he said what's the rest what he said
[55:14] let's what he said was you just let your
[55:17] light shine
[55:19] and said they'll throw you out
[55:23] so go anywhere you want to
[55:25] in this message today
[55:29] let alone a denominations go anywhere
[55:32] you where you want to
[55:36] would just let your light shine
[55:39] and you're going to be excommunicated
[55:44] so we don't worry about the quotes right
[55:47] but what's he making the statement
[55:49] he's not saying you can join anything
[55:50] you want to
[55:53] right
[55:54] he's telling you that you ain't going to
[55:57] want to join nothing else
[55:59] is that to what he's saying
[56:01] well you won't join something for her I
[56:04] was born into the family
[56:05] then you are a son of God see when this
[56:08] stature is molded up so he's doing the
[56:10] same thing here that I've done with you
[56:12] take the new birth here preach it come
[56:15] up here to The Headstone and preach
[56:17] about the new birth
[56:21] you see what he's doing
[56:23] the new birth
[56:25] come on a dead Pentecost
[56:28] Peter and them wrote in this word
[56:35] the Breath of God
[56:38] and it was put in letter form
[56:41] right
[56:43] right but remember the prophet said The
[56:46] Headstone didn't come back to her
[56:50] I've had that argument by a lot of
[56:52] people too in the message what do you
[56:54] mean headstone didn't come I mean just
[56:56] what the prophet said he said The
[56:58] Headstone didn't come back there
[57:00] why there was no church molded into a
[57:03] place where it could be done the closest
[57:04] was was the day of Pentecost but
[57:07] immediately they started falling down
[57:09] and I know I've had them here to argue
[57:11] with me about it but around said the
[57:13] real true bride even went to nicaea
[57:21] I've had them to argue with me hear
[57:23] about that about I said the true bride
[57:26] didn't go
[57:28] according to brother Randleman says it
[57:30] to you
[57:31] they said no the true bride stayed away
[57:34] well that one what the prophet said now
[57:36] I'm sorry
[57:37] the prophet said the true bride went
[57:39] down to
[57:43] was there on Azusa Street I mean they're
[57:45] on excuse me their own
[57:49] nicaea
[57:53] and I know the rest of the quotes that
[57:55] goes with it
[57:56] because when they saw that they would
[57:58] write they left
[58:01] 325 A.D when the true bride seen that
[58:04] they wouldn't write I know the rest of
[58:05] the message
[58:07] they left and I see her I agree
[58:10] they left I see you but now they don't
[58:13] listen to the rest of the words that he
[58:14] said but they picked up the doctrine
[58:18] and wrote it out with them
[58:23] there were no argument at nazia 325 A.D
[58:26] over whether there was one God or three
[58:28] Gods there was no argument about that
[58:30] read it to me I want you to read me the
[58:32] history
[58:33] I've read it it's reading a no
[58:35] the argument was whether or not Jesus
[58:38] was God or a like substance
[58:42] that was the Aries and at the finale
[58:45] ever who the two guys there's two names
[58:47] are that they argued it one of them
[58:49] believed that Jesus was almighty God
[58:53] true God the same substance the other
[58:55] one believed that he was a like
[58:57] substance which made it a demon god a
[58:59] second God and if you will get the
[59:01] original nician Creed
[59:03] and read it
[59:05] the original niceean Creed says we
[59:08] believe in one true and living God and
[59:11] Jesus as the very person
[59:14] see I've read them things but how many
[59:16] people
[59:18] so and so said it wasn't well go get the
[59:20] book and read it
[59:25] read the original and I see and Creed
[59:28] because at that time they were still
[59:30] good people
[59:31] but that guy with a big old name he had
[59:34] planted his seed
[59:36] that it took 300 years
[59:40] that many many more
[59:42] um
[59:44] meetings but by 606
[59:47] he had already planted his inroad so
[59:49] much until they come out with come out
[59:51] with it and started bringing out the
[59:53] trinitarian idea
[59:55] and isn't it amazing that what they
[59:58] started back there was that Jesus was an
[1:00:00] alike substance
[1:00:02] isn't it amazing the day that the split
[1:00:06] in the message right now is what the
[1:00:08] biggest split that's come over all of
[1:00:09] these years has been what
[1:00:11] Jesus wasn't God
[1:00:15] he was a light God he's the son of God
[1:00:19] but I'd agree with that if you know what
[1:00:20] you're talking about because me a Son of
[1:00:22] God is God made manifest in another form
[1:00:24] but that ain't what they're teaching
[1:00:26] they're teaching that he was just a man
[1:00:27] until River Jordan did he become God and
[1:00:30] that left him and he died well then you
[1:00:32] don't have a savior to die for you
[1:00:34] you see why I holler at those things so
[1:00:36] much because it won't work
[1:00:42] and you don't want it I don't like it
[1:00:43] that way and I always tell you that I
[1:00:45] try it with my new birth to see if it's
[1:00:47] right or not because my new birth go all
[1:00:49] the way back to to
[1:00:51] The Upper Room
[1:00:53] and believe in the same God all the way
[1:00:55] down now if you change God's in between
[1:00:57] her there's something wrong with your
[1:01:00] new birth
[1:01:02] it's not original
[1:01:04] I want mine to be a regional
[1:01:06] I want it to stay with the truth but
[1:01:08] look what the prophet was bringing he
[1:01:10] said after this is molded up into this
[1:01:13] when that headstone comes
[1:01:19] it'll come because somebody brought us
[1:01:22] the word
[1:01:24] now I'm going to tell you what I've said
[1:01:26] all these years
[1:01:28] and not emphasize it a whole lot
[1:01:31] I'm not looking for a headstone to come
[1:01:35] I'm looking for a manifestation yes a
[1:01:39] quickening yes a baptism to fill every
[1:01:42] fiber of our being yes but this message
[1:01:45] is the headstone
[1:01:48] if not you got to have another Prophet
[1:01:50] to come speak to us that's right now do
[1:01:52] you understand where I stand
[1:01:55] if this message is not the Breath of God
[1:01:58] being breathed upon the Bride of Jesus
[1:02:01] Christ through what the prophet has
[1:02:03] brought us from God himself
[1:02:05] then you've got to have another Prophet
[1:02:07] to the Gentiles
[1:02:11] that's right so I guess that's what all
[1:02:13] these preachers want they want to be
[1:02:14] that one
[1:02:17] because they're real quick to straighten
[1:02:19] out this one aren't they
[1:02:22] the ones that brought us into the
[1:02:24] message
[1:02:26] I'm not talking just here I'm talking to
[1:02:28] an example
[1:02:30] the ones that started us brought us into
[1:02:32] the message taught us the message
[1:02:36] now they've turned against the message
[1:02:42] we'll see if you turn against the
[1:02:44] message you got to have another Prophet
[1:02:45] to come
[1:02:49] because come on if the church is born by
[1:02:51] the of God
[1:02:53] if on the day of Pentecost
[1:02:58] that that Holy Ghost came and quickened
[1:03:00] the word that the Lord Jesus for three
[1:03:03] and a half years had planted into them
[1:03:05] and write it to life to ask for his
[1:03:07] resurrection he opened their
[1:03:09] understanding of the scriptures about
[1:03:11] himself
[1:03:12] and what was to take place
[1:03:16] and then the Holy Ghost had somewhere to
[1:03:18] fall
[1:03:22] because that's why it took this Prophet
[1:03:23] you know what he said he said it took
[1:03:26] him 30 something years to preach the
[1:03:28] statue of perfect man
[1:03:30] it's in the book
[1:03:32] the statue of perfect man
[1:03:35] and he said he took him 30 something
[1:03:36] years
[1:03:37] I can show you if you want to go back to
[1:03:39] the Intervale
[1:03:41] 1956 where he was talking about a living
[1:03:44] moving instrumentality of Jesus Christ
[1:03:47] walking in you on two feet and using
[1:03:50] your voice to speak
[1:03:52] Etc
[1:03:55] but yet one day it was fully made known
[1:03:57] because those disciples had that statue
[1:04:00] of a perfect man up to where it's called
[1:04:02] Holy Spirit right but they didn't have
[1:04:05] the headstone well now what's the
[1:04:06] headstone going to be some other God
[1:04:08] some other something is it polygamy
[1:04:11] that's what everybody thinks
[1:04:14] it what kind of a Doctrine is it
[1:04:18] is this message
[1:04:21] this prophet's message never begun in
[1:04:23] 47.
[1:04:26] from 47 to 63
[1:04:29] was restoring the faith of the same God
[1:04:33] that had already spoke that Peter and
[1:04:37] him had spoke he was going back and
[1:04:40] restoring that to understanding to each
[1:04:42] one of us
[1:04:44] go to the Rapture message that's just
[1:04:46] one he said this message began in the
[1:04:49] seals
[1:04:51] all of those years he said was just
[1:04:53] preparation
[1:04:55] getting ready to bring his message
[1:04:59] that's why I differ with the people that
[1:05:01] said he was wrong before the sea was
[1:05:03] broken right after him if he was wrong
[1:05:05] then why did God come and open the seals
[1:05:07] to him
[1:05:10] well it opened it doesn't get him
[1:05:12] straight down
[1:05:13] oh that's wonderful
[1:05:16] especially when you think you're the one
[1:05:19] that tried to straighten him out
[1:05:27] you see church God had to send us a
[1:05:29] prophet and his message begun with the
[1:05:32] opening of the word
[1:05:34] that was God breathing on us what are
[1:05:36] you looking for brother Dale in the
[1:05:37] headstone
[1:05:39] well
[1:05:40] nice brother so and so out younger he
[1:05:42] he's a young guy he's gotten the message
[1:05:44] well he's got signs and wonders
[1:05:45] following him
[1:05:50] I told you and you don't like it
[1:05:52] out there especially
[1:05:55] and wrote a random pieced off they had a
[1:05:57] man picked out
[1:05:59] that they went to check him out
[1:06:02] some of the well-known of the message
[1:06:03] went to check the man out
[1:06:08] to see if that could be
[1:06:11] a Reincarnation of another Ministry
[1:06:19] come on
[1:06:22] and only one Gentile prophet
[1:06:27] he brought his message and he passed on
[1:06:30] he spoke to us he breathed to us
[1:06:34] the only way we can be born again is to
[1:06:38] let that message come in with us I'm not
[1:06:41] talking about born again down here
[1:06:42] that's fine you can get born again down
[1:06:45] here in a Baptist Church
[1:06:50] but you ain't gonna stay there
[1:06:54] why because if it's the holy ghost that
[1:06:56] you've got you ain't going to stay there
[1:06:59] you're going to come out of that and
[1:07:01] come to the message and search until you
[1:07:03] find the real message
[1:07:07] I'm not throwing stones but I ask you a
[1:07:10] question why a lot of you come here
[1:07:20] well you think it's the only place
[1:07:23] they never said that ain't never taught
[1:07:25] no joke
[1:07:27] but I do believe we try to stay with the
[1:07:30] truth
[1:07:31] at least we've tried
[1:07:34] all right you show me somewhere else if
[1:07:35] they got more truth in what we got we'll
[1:07:37] just shut down and go
[1:07:45] you don't think I believe that
[1:07:52] I like to swap places with you
[1:07:54] for one month
[1:07:57] and let you be me and let me be you
[1:08:01] I'd like to see what you turn out to be
[1:08:10] because of what you have to fight and
[1:08:12] what you have to do and things to try to
[1:08:14] bring the truth
[1:08:18] not arguing about it
[1:08:21] just telling it like it is
[1:08:24] amen but you see church I'm not looking
[1:08:27] for The Headstone to come
[1:08:29] I forgot that a long time ago
[1:08:32] how many of you remembers probably 20 30
[1:08:35] years ago when I stood right here one
[1:08:37] day and said I'm not looking for the
[1:08:39] rapture
[1:08:44] the order scene is faces
[1:08:49] I said I thought the Rapture started on
[1:08:51] death Pentecost
[1:08:56] you mean they're not going to be in the
[1:08:58] rapture
[1:08:59] I thought that Peter or Paul explained
[1:09:02] it that we were resurrected sitting in
[1:09:04] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[1:09:08] I thought Dave was going to be part of
[1:09:10] the rapture
[1:09:11] well then we're part of the rapture we
[1:09:13] just the father man of it
[1:09:16] that's right I told you I quit looking
[1:09:18] for the coming of the Lord
[1:09:23] you remember brother random made this
[1:09:24] statement he said I'm not looking for
[1:09:26] his coming I'm saying he's here
[1:09:28] you remember that
[1:09:31] well how long has it been 1982
[1:09:35] ending up in 83 right about dark close
[1:09:38] to the sealed when
[1:09:40] and I preached a message and said
[1:09:43] I'm not looking for the coming of the
[1:09:45] Lord
[1:09:47] I'm saying he's here
[1:09:51] is that a new thought a new idea A New
[1:09:53] Concept or something's come up
[1:09:55] I've taught the new birth ever since
[1:09:57] I've been in the message
[1:10:02] Church born
[1:10:04] by the Breath of God
[1:10:07] Ezekiel
[1:10:09] feet to them bones and they'll come
[1:10:11] forth not the wind that went Blowing by
[1:10:14] made them live
[1:10:18] he was the voice of the man that called
[1:10:22] life in to them
[1:10:24] or we'll call life into Israel
[1:10:28] he spoke it back there as a promise
[1:10:32] somewhat five six thousand years later
[1:10:34] five years a full year a four thousand
[1:10:37] it'll finally take place
[1:10:40] but it'll take place because Ezekiel
[1:10:42] said it
[1:10:47] brother random said they will be a
[1:10:49] rapture
[1:10:51] now have you ever noticed him saying
[1:10:53] that I've tried to emphasize that go to
[1:10:55] the Rapture message and listen to it he
[1:10:57] said there'll be a Rapture it has been
[1:11:00] spoken now let it come to pass now
[1:11:04] what's he meaning
[1:11:10] could it be that he's saying that
[1:11:12] without him bringing that message there
[1:11:15] would have been no possibility of a
[1:11:16] Rapture ever coming I believe it
[1:11:22] I believe he spoke it
[1:11:25] but I believe somebody's got to be it
[1:11:28] Jesus said receive you the Holy Ghost it
[1:11:31] was a while before they done it but he
[1:11:34] wasn't talking about himself because he
[1:11:36] was a holy ghost but a few days later
[1:11:38] they received that experience
[1:11:44] the word he had said to unto them had
[1:11:47] become alive
[1:11:50] I thought we believed it said in the
[1:11:52] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:11:54] when he shall begin to sound
[1:11:57] the mystery of God should be revealed as
[1:11:59] he declared unto his servants the
[1:12:01] prophets
[1:12:03] I thought this message was the final
[1:12:04] message to the final age
[1:12:08] that we wasn't looking for another
[1:12:09] message to come
[1:12:11] we weren't looking for another messenger
[1:12:13] we would believe in the message but then
[1:12:15] we've done heard the voice of God
[1:12:19] that's right
[1:12:21] why would I want to listen to anything
[1:12:23] else
[1:12:25] why would I want to be concerned about
[1:12:27] anything else
[1:12:35] in the restoration of the Bride tree I
[1:12:37] ask you to go read that
[1:12:39] or listen to it and hear how he talks
[1:12:41] about how that he breathe
[1:12:44] that fourth stage
[1:12:47] which is the word
[1:12:50] that how he breathes on them
[1:12:56] but see that's where everybody's looking
[1:12:57] for something to happen
[1:13:00] one of these days
[1:13:01] some bro somebody one of these days
[1:13:09] you want to hear the voice of God
[1:13:12] turn on a tape listen to it
[1:13:15] why would you want to hear anything else
[1:13:18] why would you want to go after all of
[1:13:20] the things of
[1:13:23] of the guys you know like Benny Hinn
[1:13:25] that can walk right out in midair or has
[1:13:27] done it
[1:13:31] well the great things that happened to a
[1:13:33] lot of the ministry
[1:13:35] why would you want to go after something
[1:13:36] like that
[1:13:39] but why is everybody looking for some
[1:13:41] new thing
[1:13:46] that's why I don't look for new things
[1:13:49] I look back to see
[1:13:52] and find out what's already been
[1:13:55] because according to my Bible he's
[1:13:57] Hebrews 13 8 which means whatever he was
[1:14:00] he's always been and always will be the
[1:14:04] same yesterday today and forever are you
[1:14:07] looking for another message to come
[1:14:09] brother Dale no sir I'm not looking for
[1:14:11] another Messenger to come
[1:14:14] I'm looking at the message this man has
[1:14:17] brought
[1:14:21] and he has already breathed upon us God
[1:14:24] through that man because remember now as
[1:14:27] I'm closing that it wasn't Ezekiel that
[1:14:30] was breathing on him
[1:14:33] right
[1:14:37] but Ezekiel was prophesying
[1:14:40] breathing
[1:14:42] upon them but he was breathing The Word
[1:14:45] of Promise
[1:14:46] of these things will take place
[1:14:49] and it'll be a manifestation
[1:14:54] this Prophet has already spoken the
[1:14:56] things
[1:14:57] and brought it to her that God has used
[1:15:00] his voice to breathe upon us
[1:15:08] can I end it by saying one time
[1:15:13] if the birth of the word is true
[1:15:15] and I believe it
[1:15:19] even though the word
[1:15:21] can be spoken
[1:15:26] it is no good until the life of the word
[1:15:28] comes into the word
[1:15:34] just because brother random brought the
[1:15:36] message
[1:15:38] as I said he brought the message
[1:15:40] Jesus brought the message and Jesus
[1:15:42] opened their understanding of the
[1:15:44] message
[1:15:46] I didn't give him the new birth
[1:15:51] you see because I believe the prophet
[1:15:54] he said they'll come such a baptism of
[1:15:56] the Holy Ghost
[1:15:58] that'll fill ever fiber of our being
[1:16:01] and take us into rapture
[1:16:06] when that stature stands there
[1:16:09] molded together in the image of God
[1:16:13] not as just one individual but the
[1:16:15] entire man body of Christ around the
[1:16:17] world
[1:16:20] then God can
[1:16:23] open our understanding
[1:16:26] and reveal it to us
[1:16:33] born by the Breath of God
[1:16:36] he breathed into Adam and he received
[1:16:38] eternal life
[1:16:41] why can't he Breathe Here
[1:16:44] as this is build up an enemies out why
[1:16:46] cannot this be
[1:16:49] him breathing on us
[1:16:51] to make us eternal
[1:16:55] to make these old bodies eternal
[1:16:58] to bring us to a raptured condition
[1:17:02] you're going to find out when you get
[1:17:04] there like that
[1:17:06] it's been your journey the whole time
[1:17:13] it's been your journey
[1:17:16] that God has been bringing you through
[1:17:22] not just to jump up oh we're ready to go
[1:17:24] look at him well we got it a little boy
[1:17:25] here it is
[1:17:31] just settle down and be what you are
[1:17:36] come on musicians
[1:17:39] like I told you about a certain incident
[1:17:40] happened in a church one time
[1:17:44] and I'm not against shouting I wish
[1:17:46] everybody would understand the words
[1:17:47] that I say
[1:17:49] but those people were coming down that
[1:17:51] line and they were shouting like
[1:17:52] everything
[1:17:54] and those brothers were shaking them and
[1:17:56] calling over them and crying over them
[1:17:58] and all
[1:18:00] but the next night the same people was
[1:18:02] coming right back by
[1:18:05] and they was crying and praying over
[1:18:08] them
[1:18:09] but I was in the line and
[1:18:11] I'd just stop them and say well let's
[1:18:13] just settle down here a minute now
[1:18:15] and let's get the Lord on our mind you
[1:18:18] know and what you need and the things
[1:18:21] and let's pray
[1:18:22] well I won't call the name that's none
[1:18:24] of the business but this certain brother
[1:18:27] was standing there and he kept looking
[1:18:29] over
[1:18:30] and he kept watching me
[1:18:34] and he's saying that the line going from
[1:18:37] here to there was shouting and stopping
[1:18:39] but the line from here from where that
[1:18:41] was at after the stopping it was going
[1:18:43] that way and they was really rejoicing
[1:18:48] the next night
[1:18:50] we were in the prayer line he was
[1:18:52] standing here and I was standing here
[1:18:54] and I was listening to him
[1:18:58] he wasn't screaming and hollering as he
[1:19:00] did the night before he was talking he
[1:19:02] said let's just settle down here a
[1:19:04] little bit and think about what you need
[1:19:05] because God is the Healer and let's pray
[1:19:08] and believe that God is the Healer
[1:19:12] we see you wouldn't listen into what I
[1:19:14] said you think I'm cold and dry I don't
[1:19:16] believe in it I said the line from where
[1:19:19] I was at when it was quickened got to
[1:19:22] rejoicing
[1:19:24] because they knew what had happened
[1:19:28] they were rejoicing over something that
[1:19:30] had took place the others were rejoicing
[1:19:33] just because somebody else was there and
[1:19:35] I'm sorry
[1:19:41] I believe in shouting
[1:19:43] I believe in crying and worshiping
[1:19:47] but I believe sometimes you need to sit
[1:19:49] down and listen
[1:19:50] may I quote brother Branham
[1:19:54] he said a lot of times we're praying
[1:19:57] on paraphrase it's close but he said we
[1:20:00] do all the talking
[1:20:05] he said we need to just sit down and
[1:20:07] listen
[1:20:09] and let him talk to us
[1:20:15] we do all the Talking we don't do
[1:20:17] listening
[1:20:18] prior I thought was a communication
[1:20:21] between us and God
[1:20:24] I thought he was to speak and we was to
[1:20:26] hear
[1:20:28] I didn't know that we were to do all I
[1:20:29] was listening looking while ago with a
[1:20:31] quote where he was talking about how
[1:20:33] that we we do all of the hulking you
[1:20:35] know we want to tell God how to do
[1:20:37] things
[1:20:41] right
[1:20:42] we want to tell him how to do things
[1:20:45] well now Lord you needed it no no I
[1:20:48] asked him Lord
[1:20:50] I don't tell him Lord you need to heal
[1:20:52] Brother Gary
[1:20:56] between me and him
[1:20:59] I asked him to touch Brother Gary to
[1:21:02] heal him
[1:21:03] I asked him to make his word manifest
[1:21:06] I don't tell him what he needs to do
[1:21:11] ask him to fulfill his word
[1:21:17] what about you
[1:21:20] maybe we need to get to ask him sometime
[1:21:22] instead of trying to order him to do
[1:21:23] something
[1:21:24] well brought it in I've never ordered
[1:21:26] the Lord to do nothing
[1:21:35] have you ever just talked and told him
[1:21:37] said Lord
[1:21:38] you need to save my family
[1:21:41] you need to save my kids
[1:21:43] well you know it's true that's a good
[1:21:49] but maybe you need to say sometimes Lord
[1:21:51] I've committed them into your hands
[1:21:54] for you to do whatever is necessary
[1:21:58] to bring them in
[1:22:02] and then when they get sick oh
[1:22:05] look now
[1:22:11] what if you loosed him to God and he
[1:22:13] started dealing with them and let the
[1:22:15] devil get a hold of him I thought we
[1:22:19] were supposed to be that we left our
[1:22:20] hands off
[1:22:23] yeah but they're dying
[1:22:25] you mean to tell me you don't know how
[1:22:28] God can run his business you're trying
[1:22:30] to tell God how to do his business
[1:22:37] I've always been this way I've always
[1:22:39] believed one thing
[1:22:43] brother Maloney's sister
[1:22:46] he had seen
[1:22:48] I mean she had seen
[1:22:49] me and your situation that happened
[1:22:53] that most of you here heard me say that
[1:22:55] when I prayed for sister Maloney I
[1:22:58] turned around and looked out a window
[1:23:01] and I knew she'd never be healed
[1:23:06] I couldn't tell her
[1:23:08] I couldn't tell him
[1:23:11] there was no need of it
[1:23:15] what good would it have done
[1:23:19] I believe she was assigned I believe
[1:23:21] she's all right
[1:23:25] brother Maloney's sister heard that
[1:23:28] she used to ask me every time I'd go up
[1:23:30] you heard anything about brother Maloney
[1:23:36] is he going to live or is he going to
[1:23:38] die
[1:23:40] Sister Gone ain't told me
[1:23:44] well he told you about sister-in-one he
[1:23:47] told me but he ain't told me nothing on
[1:23:50] this case
[1:23:52] I said so I've got to pray
[1:23:55] for him to be all right and believe he's
[1:23:58] all right the day he dies call me and
[1:24:00] tell him he's dead and I'll quit praying
[1:24:03] but until that takes place I pray for
[1:24:06] his healing
[1:24:08] well now she calls Sam
[1:24:12] Jesse passed on
[1:24:15] he said all right we quit praying now
[1:24:22] you don't believe that God can let you
[1:24:24] go down to the last Split Second and
[1:24:26] raise you back up
[1:24:29] I will remind you that in brother
[1:24:31] Brown's Ministries about seven times the
[1:24:33] dead was raised so that went on past the
[1:24:36] last moment didn't it and then he come
[1:24:38] on the scene
[1:24:40] let's quit trying to tell God what to do
[1:24:42] and start talking to him but
[1:24:44] the best thing to do is thank him for it
[1:24:49] won't you do that instead of instead of
[1:24:51] any boots about the kids and start
[1:24:53] thanking him and say thank you Lord
[1:24:54] thank you Lord for saving them thank you
[1:24:56] Lord for saying it gets worse you say
[1:24:58] Thank You Lord it gets worse than thank
[1:25:00] you Lord they get sick he say thank you
[1:25:01] Lord
[1:25:04] foreign
[1:25:12] that fits only in a place where you've
[1:25:14] experienced it yourself
[1:25:18] understand
[1:25:20] what do we got 604
[1:25:24] wraps
[1:25:27] if we never
[1:25:29] meet again
[1:25:38] and if to God
[1:26:12] I'll see you
[1:26:15] the Rapture
[1:26:17] I'll see you in the Rapture
[1:26:23] I'll see you at that
[1:26:36] blessed savior
[1:26:39] we'll live and Reign forever
[1:26:44] I'll see you in the Rapture
[1:26:49] some sweetness
[1:26:52] now we all know the story
[1:26:56] but to remind you
[1:26:59] brother and sister Anderson wanted a
[1:27:02] child years ago
[1:27:03] not to more than that on back
[1:27:07] but they were not able to have a child
[1:27:12] the Lord had spoke to me about it and
[1:27:14] I just didn't say nothing because
[1:27:17] if he tells you what do you I want to be
[1:27:20] first I want you to know I said that
[1:27:22] first
[1:27:24] now that ain't nothing but an exalted
[1:27:25] Spirit it ain't the Holy Spirit
[1:27:28] so I just waited
[1:27:31] he sure would have been good to told
[1:27:32] them might have but he might have
[1:27:34] hindered them too
[1:27:37] brother my brother Forney came and he
[1:27:40] preached one night and
[1:27:42] I had told him that they were seeking a
[1:27:45] child
[1:27:46] we had discussed that a little bit I
[1:27:49] didn't tell him the Lord had spoke to me
[1:27:51] about it I just said we're believing it
[1:27:56] he walked right down the aisle and
[1:27:57] walked right up to him and said
[1:28:00] God's going to give you that child
[1:28:03] well we got a little picture in office
[1:28:05] said the child that Faith brought
[1:28:07] well I believe it there she is little
[1:28:09] Sarah
[1:28:11] all right
[1:28:13] now little Sarah wants a brother or
[1:28:15] sister amen
[1:28:18] he said well I don't know where Sabra
[1:28:20] does or not
[1:28:23] all right
[1:28:25] let's see brother and sister Anderson
[1:28:26] they want another child
[1:28:29] and they've got plans to go through and
[1:28:31] doctors again all the time
[1:28:34] but
[1:28:35] let's just pray and say I want to give
[1:28:38] him this prayer cloth for them together
[1:28:40] to keep
[1:28:42] unless to believe it and Sarah to
[1:28:44] believe it right Sarah
[1:28:46] okay
[1:28:48] see my little sweetheart she give me
[1:28:49] sugar
[1:28:51] you couldn't see her on the camera she's
[1:28:53] just laughing
[1:28:54] all right listen
[1:28:58] they want another child
[1:29:00] so let's believe it
[1:29:01] okay
[1:29:03] well
[1:29:05] we're not concerned we just
[1:29:08] praying together
[1:29:09] they want to church to pray with them
[1:29:11] about another child
[1:29:14] all right
[1:29:15] so let's just commit it to the hands of
[1:29:17] the Lord
[1:29:18] and believe it
[1:29:21] he hasn't spoke to me to tell them that
[1:29:23] they can have a child they're going to
[1:29:25] have a child if he tells me I'll tell
[1:29:27] him
[1:29:30] but I want to believe the word what they
[1:29:32] want what they desire
[1:29:34] right
[1:29:36] father
[1:29:38] we hold the hands here of our brother
[1:29:40] and sister and you know that one time
