[3:42] in your scriptures there's going to be a
[3:44] little injected message tonight so we
[3:47] won't be going to Revelations 1 we're
[3:49] going to Luke
[3:52] 11 just kind of a do it in a little
[3:56] different form tonight instead of tying
[3:58] it all together but just pray one for
[4:01] another the Lord would bless and keep
[4:03] each
[4:04] one now the Lord willing next
[4:07] Wednesday uh brother Dale Smith will be
[4:10] here preaching our on this coming up
[4:12] Wednesday so remember that and be much
[4:15] in prayer
[4:16] amen youve heard all the other
[4:18] announcements all of the things so just
[4:21] keep these things in your mind amen Luke
[4:25] 11 very familiar scripture with all of
[4:28] us but we want to just talk a little bit
[4:29] on it and see what the Lord has to
[4:33] say father we thank you for this night
[4:36] that we have that we can gather together
[4:39] thank you for the opportunity together
[4:41] because Lord a lot of people don't have
[4:44] this ability or time lord and there but
[4:49] you give it to us so we ask you now that
[4:51] you would just come and be with us and
[4:54] speak to our hearts and that Lord our
[4:57] thoughts and meditations be Solly upon
[4:59] you
[5:00] forgive our sins and just lead us in
[5:03] thine understanding that we may see you
[5:07] manifest Among Us you promised it so we
[5:11] believe you you said you'd come Among Us
[5:13] and heal the sick and Deliver us from
[5:15] our destructions and you do it by the
[5:18] revealed word of the hour that we're
[5:20] living we pray that you'd guide each one
[5:22] now bless those that are not here
[5:24] remember each one lead us in Jesus name
[5:28] amen
[5:30] very familiar scripture with all of
[5:33] us so when we get down to
[5:36] the the part then you read you say it
[5:40] with me okay when we get down into the
[5:43] second
[5:45] verse and it came to pass that he as he
[5:47] was praying in a certain place when he
[5:50] ceased one of his disciples said unto
[5:52] him Lord teach us to pray as John also
[5:56] taught his disciples and he said unto
[5:59] true
[6:01] then when you pray say Our Father which
[6:06] art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy
[6:10] kingdom come thy will be done as in
[6:13] heaven so in Earth give us our daily
[6:18] bread and forgive our sins for as we
[6:22] also forgive everyone that is indebted
[6:24] to us and lead us not into temptation
[6:28] but Deliver Us from Evil you may be
[6:31] seated the Lord add His blessings to the
[6:34] reading of the
[6:35] word now we'll get over into to Matthew
[6:40] in a minute so you can turn to Matthew
[6:42] 6 but I wanted to just read that one
[6:45] because the point is in there where that
[6:48] that they the disciples came to the Lord
[6:51] Jesus and they said teach us to
[6:54] pray all right now I am sure of one
[6:59] thing
[7:00] they had seen his
[7:03] prayers on many occasion be
[7:06] answered so they uh you know they were
[7:10] concerned and they wanted to know how to
[7:13] get their prayers answered well that's
[7:15] that's a a good point and it should be
[7:18] thoughty un to us and uh and we'll get
[7:22] to the main point of it in a a little
[7:24] bit but see I want you to think about
[7:26] that they seen Jesus they heard him pray
[7:31] right and they seen his prayers were
[7:34] answered well you know I mean you you
[7:36] talk to somebody and you say well you
[7:38] know when I see your prayers are
[7:40] answered I I'd like for you to show me
[7:43] how to pray now to me in the Lord's
[7:47] Prayer is the greatest I looked it up
[7:50] and brother brandom said it about three
[7:52] times he said they tried their best to
[7:54] add to the Lord's Prayer and said uh
[7:58] they've never been able to add one word
[8:00] to it because it was so perfect to start
[8:03] with all right so then it's not a you
[8:07] know it it's not something that you can
[8:09] can add a word to it's got everything in
[8:12] there and we'll cover that in a minute
[8:14] now it's got
[8:15] everything in other words everything
[8:18] that would be for Life y everything that
[8:21] would be in any form of living right uh
[8:24] you know Salvation
[8:28] healing anything that you have need of
[8:31] is in the Lord's Prayer now all right
[8:35] now brother Brandon would even at times
[8:39] pray for
[8:40] people and maybe you know they would not
[8:43] be
[8:45] delivered but yet he'd say okay now
[8:48] we're going to pray one more time and
[8:50] Satan you'll come out and he'd pray the
[8:53] Lord's Prayer right right now we look at
[8:57] it as
[9:00] the said to whatever we have need
[9:03] of is contained in that
[9:06] prayer there's a little difference in
[9:08] the wording from Luke than it is from
[9:11] Matthew but still it's the same prayer
[9:15] that was made and they were asking him
[9:17] they don't ask him in Matthew to teach
[9:19] them to pray and you know and that was
[9:22] the reason I was reading in Luke that
[9:24] they do ask him that point
[9:28] now
[9:30] I
[9:31] know that
[9:34] actually here in Matthew is not the
[9:38] prayer of the Lord right that would be
[9:42] in John right 17 right right when Jesus
[9:46] would be praying for us amen and that
[9:50] according to a lot of people is called
[9:52] The Lord's Prayer all right and it was
[9:55] the prayer that the Lord
[9:57] made see
[10:00] all right but yet still now if anybody
[10:03] anywhere in brother brandham you run it
[10:05] in there it's a it's 11 times that he
[10:08] actually uses you know Our Father which
[10:11] art in heaven right and if you ask us
[10:15] tonight as I said you you pray with me
[10:18] you know you read with me if we said now
[10:20] we're going to stand and say the Lord's
[10:21] Prayer we wouldn't go over to John
[10:25] 17 right right right we would go here
[10:29] and repeat you know the things of Our
[10:32] Father which art in heaven Hallowed be
[10:34] thy name because that is more or less in
[10:37] what all mankind calls The Lord's Prayer
[10:41] all right now as I said now you you go
[10:44] over to
[10:45] John and that is the prayer the Lord
[10:48] made for us that was not an example
[10:53] prayor as to teach us how to pray right
[10:57] that was a pray a pray that the Lord
[10:59] made right see he prayed for us and our
[11:02] our doings but now when you say the
[11:05] Lord's priy then you're automatically
[11:07] coming here to you know to Our Father
[11:10] which are in heaven because that would
[11:11] be the the basis of of what you're
[11:14] looking at see and as I said now
[11:18] Jesus in his
[11:22] praying he would speak to his
[11:26] father right all right
[11:29] now because that was the the reason that
[11:32] you'd say well now who do you pray to
[11:34] brother Dale that's that's the the the
[11:36] Lord's Prayer is the title but the
[11:39] the real title is who do you pray
[11:42] to remember I mentioned the other day
[11:44] that I was going to speak on that a
[11:46] little bit when I got time so I decided
[11:48] to go ahead and use it tonight and then
[11:51] uh drop back on to what we're on uh in
[11:54] the Book of
[11:56] Revelations but
[11:57] now
[11:59] as I said now I get to
[12:03] Point in the Lord's
[12:07] Prayer is everything
[12:11] right that we would have need
[12:14] of so if you have need of anything if
[12:17] you need material wealth we'll get to it
[12:19] in a minute pray the Lord's Prayer if
[12:21] you need healing pray the Lord's Prayer
[12:24] you need salvation pray the Lord's
[12:27] Prayer
[12:29] because in that is all that you have
[12:31] need
[12:32] of see and that's why that when they ask
[12:35] him you know Lord teach us to
[12:40] pray so he gave them you know a prayer
[12:43] to say and it's not that you have to
[12:46] just go say that prayer in a repetitious
[12:49] form we'll get to that in the in the
[12:51] Book of Matthew here in a minute but
[12:54] it's to knowing what you're
[12:57] praying and my point is to know who
[13:00] we're praying to right you said well
[13:03] brother Dale I I I've always known who
[13:05] to pray to yeah when we were
[13:07] trinitarians we prayed to Jesus to ask
[13:10] him to get the Holy Ghost to intercede
[13:13] to the
[13:17] father that
[13:20] right he said no no no Brother D I never
[13:23] did do that well we see that's that's
[13:26] what we done right because we didn't
[13:29] know who to pray
[13:31] to all right and see now as I said in
[13:34] the message a lot of people that some of
[13:36] the brothers especially about the river
[13:38] Jordans and the thing they're saying
[13:40] don't pray in the name Jesus you know
[13:42] don't pray to Jesus in other words not
[13:44] necessarily not in the name don't pray
[13:47] don't pray to Jesus
[13:49] Anymore CU see you know that would be
[13:52] just a well they don't understand that's
[13:55] right we'll get to that in a minute they
[13:56] don't understand the the whole story
[13:58] story to me then I don't have to worry
[14:00] about it but it's kind of like brother
[14:03] um Lincoln Barner said a man on heard
[14:06] him on the radio one day and said he
[14:07] told him he said y'all are the most
[14:09] mixed up people I've ever heard in my
[14:11] life said you
[14:13] pray and said you ask the father for
[14:16] something and said then you say in Jesus
[14:20] name you know well if you know who the
[14:23] father really is right then you don't
[14:26] have to worry about it all right but now
[14:29] let's get the point get get the point of
[14:31] what I want to bring down and then we'll
[14:33] we'll bring a little point of what I
[14:35] want to bring about you know who do we
[14:36] pray to the all right so now the Lord's
[14:41] Prayer he was
[14:44] praying now the point I want you to
[14:46] notice go to
[14:49] Matthew he was praying to his father
[14:55] right in other words when they said
[14:58] teach us to pray he didn't say pray Your
[15:02] Father which art in
[15:06] Heaven he didn't say that did he
[15:09] right right he said pray Our Father yeah
[15:13] all right now you get on over in there
[15:15] after his resurrection and his coming
[15:17] back to the disciples you remember he
[15:20] said I go to my
[15:23] father and your
[15:25] father amen I think it's John 16 36 I
[15:29] believe what it
[15:31] is I go unto my father and your
[15:36] father I go unto my God right and your
[15:42] God because he knew who he was praying
[15:45] to that's right but the emphasis I want
[15:48] you to get is that he wasn't just
[15:50] praying to the one inside of
[15:55] him because if that would be true why
[15:58] would we even pray
[16:00] outwardly you know what would be the
[16:03] purpose of praying outwardly if you're
[16:04] only think that you're praying only to
[16:06] the one that's inside of you
[16:09] right that's the one thing that I've
[16:11] tried to get you to see about that as
[16:14] long as we're here in this world we're
[16:17] dealing with sunship right we're dealing
[16:20] with
[16:22] intercessory right we're dealing with an
[16:27] advocate you don't do away with that
[16:29] even when you get on the other side it
[16:32] just all becomes into to the one
[16:35] person but now just think with me of
[16:38] what I'm trying to say so let's go to
[16:39] Matthew
[16:40] 6
[16:42] right let's just read the background
[16:48] now in other words in Luke they said
[16:51] teach us to
[16:53] pray all right let's go over to
[16:57] Matthew and let's get the
[17:00] background and see that the background
[17:03] is what is saying teach us to
[17:06] pray they they were both saying the same
[17:08] thing right right you
[17:11] understand teach us to pray all right in
[17:15] other words what do we need to
[17:18] do to be able to
[17:21] contact the God that you are in contact
[17:27] with and he he gives them the part that
[17:29] we read in
[17:31] Luke but then in Matthew see in his
[17:35] writing look what he says about it he
[17:38] gives an order or a way to approach
[17:43] god so let's take that and just look at
[17:46] it verse one 6th chapter take heed that
[17:51] ye do not your arms before men to be
[17:54] seen of them otherwise you have no
[17:57] reward of your
[17:59] Father which is in
[18:02] heaven now teach us to
[18:07] pray now Jesus wouldn't saying uh are
[18:10] you listening it it seems to be that
[18:13] you're not following my point right here
[18:15] and maybe it's me
[18:18] but in Luke he said they said teach us
[18:21] to pray right
[18:23] amen now Jesus in Matthew is telling you
[18:26] how to pray right
[18:29] right and prayer is not just
[18:32] words
[18:35] right you said well well that's right we
[18:37] we just pray well now pray the Lord's
[18:42] Prayer you're going to have to pray one
[18:45] and not the
[18:47] other and in one of them it says in
[18:50] heaven the other says in earth
[18:53] right
[18:54] right there's a little difference in the
[18:57] wording
[18:59] but my point is what is
[19:03] prayer well you got to get down you got
[19:05] you know you got to bow down and put
[19:07] your hands up you got to do this or you
[19:09] got to get in front of the prophet's
[19:11] picture or the Lord Jesus Christ's
[19:13] picture what you got to know what is
[19:18] prayer how is it that the Bible spreads
[19:21] pray without ceasing right is that
[19:25] scripture right now how can you pray
[19:27] without ceasing
[19:30] if it's put your hands up B on your
[19:31] knees get to do this whatever how is it
[19:34] that you're going to be able to do
[19:38] that all right now prayer is a more of a
[19:42] state of
[19:44] mind then it is verbal words right that
[19:49] we
[19:51] speak you know yourself sometimes what
[19:54] you do you pray you just pray to you in
[19:56] inwardly don't you right right you don't
[19:59] have to pray
[20:00] outwardly but yet there are times we
[20:03] pray
[20:05] outwardly now in doing it that way and
[20:08] God setting it up then it put mankind
[20:11] into a place like that as we read here
[20:14] that sometimes if we ain't careful we'll
[20:16] get exalted in our
[20:19] prayers what was it there in the book of
[20:21] Acts the the man the the king or
[20:23] whatever he was you remember he was
[20:26] sitting on a throne or doing something
[20:28] there I believe in the book of Acts and
[20:30] uh he got he spoke some great swelling
[20:33] words where they just jumped up and said
[20:34] that is the words of
[20:36] God well God smoted him right there
[20:39] right because he wouldn't have him to
[20:42] share his
[20:43] glory but get my point in that what I'm
[20:46] saying prayer is not just to say
[20:50] words prayer is a state of mind it is no
[20:54] joke where brother random was saying
[20:56] that the little boy just put his ABCs MH
[21:01] and stuck them out in the woods you know
[21:02] and said my Lord and you come by you
[21:06] just put the words together right well
[21:09] because every letter that would be said
[21:11] in the prayer if it was 2 hours long or
[21:13] two words long would be coming out of
[21:16] that
[21:17] alphabetical situation so it's not a
[21:20] point of a joke it's a
[21:22] truth but prayer is a state of mind
[21:27] right
[21:28] you just put your yourself when you're
[21:30] praying put yourself in a state of
[21:33] mind I've listening here not too long
[21:36] ago brother Randon was talking about how
[21:38] that he was going out to pray for the
[21:40] meeting that they
[21:42] had he said he got in one place and said
[21:45] I don't remember exact order but
[21:47] something to this degree and he said
[21:49] that the Thorns was
[21:51] sickening said he moved over in another
[21:53] place and said the mosquitoes started
[21:56] getting him you know now he's out to
[21:59] pray for the meetings and he finally
[22:02] said he he said the mosquitoes was
[22:04] eating him up so bad said finally just
[22:06] said just in other words just eat all
[22:07] you want to I'm going to pray so he just
[22:10] got into his state of praying and he
[22:12] wasn't much concerned about the
[22:13] mosquitos huh see it's a state of mind
[22:16] that's not something to do it and a
[22:19] state of mind has to do with your
[22:25] life right right it has to do with your
[22:28] life and what we're doing so then we can
[22:30] see
[22:32] there that we got a certain way to
[22:35] approach God then
[22:38] all so he says now don't do your you
[22:43] know do not your arms before men to be
[22:46] seen of them otherwise you have no
[22:49] reward of your father which is in
[22:52] heaven now if we get all exalted in
[22:54] ourselves what
[22:56] happens okay keep on going verse two
[23:00] therefore when thou doest thine arms or
[23:03] deeds or or you know religious Acts or
[23:05] whatever you want to call it do not
[23:07] sound a trumpet before thee as the
[23:11] Hypocrites do in the synagogues and in
[23:13] the streets that they may have Glory of
[23:16] men verely I say unto you they have
[23:18] their
[23:21] reward you do it on that account you got
[23:24] your reward what is your reward
[23:26] everybody around you
[23:29] you know I no reward from God but that's
[23:31] what most people want I I believe and I
[23:34] I watch people and they're praying and
[23:36] and I'm not throwing off now on nobody
[23:38] but when I hear people pray sometimes I
[23:41] think they're talking to the
[23:44] congregation they're not talking to
[23:48] God you know watch their
[23:52] prayers you know they're not talking to
[23:55] God they're talking to worth every
[23:58] somebody else can hear the great
[23:59] swelling words that they
[24:02] use to make them think that they're
[24:05] talking to God all right so now watch's
[24:08] the point
[24:11] now but when th doest arms let not thy
[24:14] left hand know what thy right hand
[24:19] doth now that's within yourself right
[24:23] don't get
[24:24] exalted don't get nothing in the way
[24:27] like that what what
[24:30] it that thine arms may be in secret and
[24:33] thy father which seeth in secret himself
[24:36] shall reward thee openly now this is the
[24:39] scripture that brother brandham was
[24:40] using and and spoke on the seventh seal
[24:45] right we'll read it down in just a
[24:47] minute but it was told him on this when
[24:49] you enter into your closet when he said
[24:52] I don't understand he said enter into
[24:56] your closet and he that pray in secret
[24:59] the Lord shall reward thee
[25:01] openly so it's not just a play something
[25:05] get you get to point now in just a
[25:06] minute what I'm talking
[25:10] about that thine arms may be in secret
[25:13] and thy father which seeth in secret
[25:15] himself shall reward thee
[25:17] openly and when thou prayest Thou shalt
[25:20] not be as the Hypocrites are for they
[25:22] love to pray standing in the synagogues
[25:24] and in the corners of the streets that
[25:27] they may be seen of men verily I say
[25:31] unto you they have their
[25:35] reward because they're sin of
[25:39] man is that what we want when we're
[25:41] praying what about the state of mind
[25:43] we're
[25:44] in
[25:46] right do we want somebody else to hear
[25:49] us you know now I don't know whether
[25:53] this happened or not but Billy Paul if I
[25:55] ain't mistaken when it told it said one
[25:57] day he come running in to to they all
[25:59] eaten and he came running in and he he
[26:01] just got his meal and he said his prayer
[26:04] and said his daddy said Son do you think
[26:07] God heard you cuz I
[26:09] didn't now there's nothing wrong with
[26:11] praying quiet
[26:13] and I think he was just making a point
[26:15] to to Billy you
[26:17] know right see we're not to go out and
[26:21] blast
[26:23] them well then then I just won't pray no
[26:25] more outwardly no that's not true
[26:27] because Jesus
[26:29] said pray that the lord of the Harvest
[26:34] would send laborers into the
[26:37] vineyard
[26:40] right you now he's wanting us
[26:44] to pray right it's not the point that we
[26:48] just don't pray and we say well I just
[26:50] won't pray I I'll just do all of I pray
[26:52] it in secret and all now
[26:55] that's if you're doing a lot in secret I
[26:57] ain't worried about it you know
[27:01] what if you're doing a lot of praying to
[27:04] God in secret I'm not worried about the
[27:06] other prayers you and I making because
[27:08] it'll be it'll be taken care of all
[27:11] right but now look what I'm
[27:15] saying don't do like the Hypocrites see
[27:17] they've got their reward but thou when
[27:20] thou prayest enter into thy
[27:23] closet and when thou H has shut thy door
[27:26] pray to the father Father which is in
[27:28] secret and thy father which seeth in
[27:31] secret shall reward thee
[27:34] openly now have we got to go into a
[27:40] closet back when we were you know years
[27:43] ago I some of the preachers preach like
[27:44] this they said well you need to pray 30
[27:47] minutes before you put on a tap listen
[27:48] to it I said I only have 30 minutes to
[27:50] listen to the tape
[27:53] right so I said Lord help me and I put
[27:56] the tape on
[27:58] you see they said well you know need to
[28:01] pray 30 minutes before well I wouldn't
[28:03] never get to listen to a tape hard it
[28:05] you know I didn't have time back then
[28:07] have more time now right but I didn't
[28:10] have the time back then what does it
[28:12] mean brother random said when you say
[28:14] enter into the
[28:17] closet well what you need to do is find
[28:19] your closet and and you need to ENT well
[28:22] that's good if that's what you
[28:25] believe if that's your state of mind or
[28:28] your thoughts or whatever enter into the
[28:34] closets and pray in
[28:36] secret but what is it praying to God to
[28:39] reveal his
[28:41] Secrets is what we should be praying
[28:46] amen and he'll reward us openly
[28:51] right because he bring it to
[28:54] us like we were talking about the other
[28:56] day about Sim keeping the worshiper
[29:00] clean where Jacob laid down put his head
[29:02] on the Rock and looked up and there was
[29:04] a ladder going up you know going up to
[29:06] heaven and the angels ascending and
[29:10] descending the Angels going up coming
[29:13] back down what were they doing taking
[29:15] his
[29:17] prayers The Book of Revelation speaks of
[29:19] the prayers of the
[29:21] Saints and one day when they're poured
[29:24] out then the tribulation will take place
[29:30] that's not a as I said you know it's not
[29:32] a bowl full of prayers and then you dump
[29:34] them
[29:35] out those are just points of getting us
[29:39] to see what's going on
[29:42] right now watch what he goes on to
[29:47] say but when you pray use not vain
[29:51] repetitions as the Heathen do for they
[29:53] think they shall be heard for their much
[29:56] speaking
[29:59] now this is a prayerful
[30:03] attitude to get us to the
[30:06] prayer you understand what I said a
[30:08] moment ago prayer is an attitude of
[30:12] mind all
[30:15] right now following this
[30:18] example we see within
[30:21] that what we need to do
[30:24] first our life in line
[30:27] right
[30:29] right have our life in line then our
[30:32] prayers won't be
[30:34] hindered
[30:36] right I mean there scriptures for
[30:38] everything for fasting and things like
[30:40] that but you know and the correct way to
[30:44] do things God didn't leave us without
[30:46] any right anything he gave us the answer
[30:49] to
[30:51] everything that's what I'm saying in
[30:53] Luke it says teach us to pray Matthew
[30:56] he's telling you how to get into the
[30:58] attitude or the correct way to be able
[31:00] to pray the Lord's
[31:04] Prayer to me that's the same
[31:08] thing I can take Matthew now and put it
[31:11] right over with
[31:13] Luke and say Lord teach us to pray he
[31:16] says all right this is the way you do do
[31:17] these things
[31:19] first is your life lined up over
[31:25] here do you pray your pray before men
[31:28] that you may be seen
[31:30] yeah do you do this do you do that just
[31:33] what we've been
[31:35] reading all
[31:38] right we
[31:41] see the
[31:45] he you know what they do screaming and
[31:51] hollering you know
[31:56] loud
[31:59] you hear a lot of people a lot of
[32:01] preachers now come on I'm just
[32:05] talking you hear them praying and it
[32:09] sounds like they're praying off
[32:10] somewhere 40 Mi away because they're
[32:12] real
[32:13] loud you know I mean I know the story
[32:17] don't just go on forget it I know the
[32:22] story God's not deaf either and he's not
[32:26] nervous
[32:27] either you know that's what one group
[32:29] would say well he's not nervous and he's
[32:32] not
[32:34] deaf but see you're using that to try to
[32:36] justify what you're
[32:43] doing we pray and we talk right to our
[32:47] father and we asked him right and he
[32:52] says well have you done these other
[32:55] things is our life lined up up you know
[32:58] if our life's lined up we don't have no
[32:59] right to ask God you know if it's not
[33:02] lined up we don't have no right to ask
[33:03] God to give us
[33:08] anything that's why the the prophet
[33:11] preached a message about it you
[33:13] know repent to be
[33:20] healed you
[33:22] know but see we we're still not to the
[33:25] point that we don't when somebody comes
[33:27] up to be prayed for I don't say all
[33:29] right you confessed all your sins this
[33:31] week we ought
[33:35] to of course you'd have a whole lot less
[33:37] going to be prayed
[33:42] for but you see if our lives that's the
[33:45] point of what I'm trying to get at is
[33:48] Luke just tells you that they said teach
[33:51] us to pray
[33:53] right Matthew is telling you the order
[33:56] are
[33:57] line up to come down to be able to make
[34:00] the
[34:04] prayer cuz he's telling you how to
[34:06] approach
[34:10] it watch let's read verse 7 and 8 now
[34:13] back together but when you pray use not
[34:15] vain repetitions as the Heathen do for
[34:18] they think they shall be heard for their
[34:20] much speaking be not ye therefore like
[34:23] unto them for your father knoweth what
[34:26] things you have need of before you ask
[34:29] him thank
[34:31] Lord he knows what you have need of well
[34:35] like I said a minute go well they don't
[34:36] need me praying God knows what he knows
[34:38] I need
[34:42] it well now according to that attitude
[34:44] that would not fit back up in all of
[34:46] this other right and according to that
[34:48] attitude God would have no reason to
[34:50] answer a
[34:52] prayer ask a father in my name
[34:58] pray the Lord of the Harvest in the
[35:00] sinful labor
[35:01] right he wants us to
[35:07] pray all right he was almighty
[35:10] God but you know the scripture said he
[35:13] prayed much
[35:14] right he prayed all night one
[35:17] night that's recorded in the
[35:23] scripture now he was the lord of the
[35:25] Harvest
[35:27] we'll get back to it in a minute but who
[35:29] was he praying
[35:34] to I look like he just sat there inside
[35:37] of me something going on there I'm
[35:39] praying that's all
[35:43] right it's all right to do that that's
[35:46] fine the biggest portion probably of my
[35:48] praying is is just within me right
[35:52] that's where I see that scripture where
[35:53] that you know pray without ceasing then
[35:56] that way you can be at work it can be
[35:57] anywhere you can be in a restaurant you
[35:59] can be in a in a in
[36:02] a worldly thing out there and you can be
[36:04] sitting there praying you know what I
[36:07] mean right cuz you can't go nowhere now
[36:10] that there's not a hollering and
[36:11] screaming going
[36:14] on you don't have to go to sports events
[36:17] to find
[36:19] out just anywhere you
[36:22] are but get what I'm saying now this is
[36:25] a background
[36:28] then he gets down to the
[36:31] point after this manner therefore pray
[36:34] ye now he's going to say
[36:37] what he says in the Book of
[36:43] Luke but see Luke didn't put this up
[36:46] here but don't you believe this up here
[36:48] would go with the Book of Luke that's
[36:50] right right as a line up or a way of
[36:54] getting us to a place to pray
[36:57] amen and how to pray and not pray
[37:03] repetitious you know what I mean by that
[37:06] and it's it's not saying when you when
[37:08] you say don't pray repetitions it's not
[37:10] saying that not you don't know you can't
[37:13] say the same thing over and over right
[37:15] that's
[37:19] right but if you read Our Father which
[37:21] art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy
[37:23] kingdom come that would be repetitious
[37:25] wouldn't it right
[37:27] if you kept saying the same thing see
[37:29] get it in the correct order of what
[37:30] we're to deal
[37:36] with it doesn't bother God to remind him
[37:39] what his word has to
[37:41] say that's what he wants us to
[37:44] do and prayer then now watch what it
[37:48] say
[37:51] look therefore pray this way Our Father
[37:55] which art in heaven now our
[38:01] father he's got the same father
[38:07] exactly he's got the same
[38:10] father and where is his
[38:13] father which are in heaven
[38:19] right hallowed are sacred are
[38:22] consecrated or
[38:24] Sanctified be thy name
[38:30] now here within
[38:32] these three or four verses as I said
[38:37] you'll find everything you have need
[38:40] of everything you would have need of is
[38:43] in there that's why the prophet would
[38:45] say Okay Satan you won't come out we
[38:50] prayed but said you will come out
[38:55] now and he would pray the Lord's
[38:59] Prayer and Satan would come
[39:03] out right because everything in
[39:08] here that we're reading in this Lord's
[39:11] Prayer is reminding God y of what he
[39:16] come to do right what he
[39:22] said what he was getting us to
[39:25] do the life he wanted us to
[39:28] live the things that we have need
[39:33] of show me what else it would be let's
[39:35] just go through it just for a
[39:37] second see Our Father which art in
[39:40] Heaven how long could you stay on that
[39:42] part Hallowed be thy name and what's his
[39:47] name I remember brother Mo telling him
[39:49] about he was in a u Baptist Church I
[39:52] think it was way back years ago you know
[39:55] and uh the man he wasn't in the church
[39:57] said man at the church asked him to come
[39:59] and teach Sunday school cuz they' heard
[40:01] him talking you know and he said all
[40:03] right and he said uh I'm going to come
[40:05] and just take the Lord's
[40:06] Prayer and said uh you know we'll just
[40:09] take the Lord's Prayer and I'll just
[40:11] teach on it and the man okay that's
[40:13] good and he made it to this far cuz when
[40:17] he got to where he said Hallowed be thy
[40:20] name the man told him he didn't want him
[40:23] to come back
[40:25] anymore
[40:27] see because he got into the name right
[40:31] amen and the water baptism in the name
[40:34] of the Lord Jesus Christ that's
[40:37] amen so they didn't want him
[40:41] back but Hallowed be thy name what's his
[40:44] name his name is
[40:47] Jesus I come in my father's name so his
[40:51] father's name would have to be Jesus
[40:55] am
[40:56] and we're going to get down to a point
[40:58] where that that I couldn't find the
[41:00] exact quotation that brother R made but
[41:02] I know it's there but he says you can
[41:04] call him Jesus Jesus and not get
[41:10] nothing because it's the state of mind
[41:13] that you're in that's right
[41:17] amen will you be honest enough to admit
[41:19] that sometimes you pray and it's not
[41:21] actually a prayer of state of mind it's
[41:23] a verbal words that you've used to just
[41:26] say I need to
[41:27] pray would you agree with that I
[41:35] will maybe that's why we don't get what
[41:37] we ask
[41:40] for cuz he said ask the father anything
[41:42] in my
[41:46] name maybe the reason we don't get it is
[41:48] because we're not following this part up
[41:50] here that our correct attitude our
[41:54] correct State of Mind is not come into
[41:56] being because we've not we've done our
[41:58] arms to be heard of men we've done our
[42:01] prayers to be out in the open we've done
[42:03] these
[42:08] things and maybe that's why our prayers
[42:11] are not
[42:15] answered right but look what he
[42:19] says Hallowed be thy
[42:25] name see this is the day we'll get to it
[42:28] in a
[42:30] minute because when Jesus was saying
[42:32] those things of ask anything in my name
[42:36] the father anything in my
[42:38] name if you'll notice right before then
[42:41] it says at that
[42:46] day that's this day
[42:51] right the day of this Revelation the day
[42:54] when we really know who and what the
[42:57] name of Jesus really is that's
[42:59] right cuz you can take the name of Jesus
[43:01] and sometime maybe I'll do it but you
[43:03] can run it all the way back to Jehovah
[43:05] and jehovas see and actually the word
[43:07] Joshua even comes from from the name
[43:10] Jesus and all it comes down to that
[43:12] keeping coming too you
[43:16] know and you can see that it was back
[43:19] there in the Old Testament as was trying
[43:20] to bring out a
[43:23] Sunday where your Prophet said it was D
[43:26] y that those prophets said the name of
[43:29] Jesus now they didn't say Jesus they
[43:31] said Jehovah or Yahweh or or Elohim or
[43:38] whatever but they knew his
[43:41] name that's why it's jvh V see it can't
[43:45] Jehovah is not it that's why the
[43:46] scripture said in my name Jehovah was I
[43:48] never
[43:51] known it's jvh V it can't be pronounced
[43:53] why cuz it's j s u s am that's the best
[43:56] way to say
[43:58] it as I said when the angel Gabriel
[44:01] delivered to Mary he not only delivered
[44:04] a message that she would have a
[44:07] child but he he delivered the message of
[44:10] the name
[44:14] right even named
[44:17] John he brought a
[44:20] name and Jesus is that
[44:23] name right so then when he said ask
[44:26] anything in my
[44:29] name now get what I'm saying the state
[44:32] of mind is what you're doing is not
[44:34] verbal word so you don't have to say
[44:36] Jesus Jesus Jesus
[44:41] Jesus you might be saying yo whatever
[44:44] how you pronounce it in Spanish
[44:50] Jesu you might not even be using his
[44:53] name well I said it and that's why maybe
[44:57] we don't get our prayers
[45:03] answered to be in his name means to be
[45:06] in all of the line that we're talking
[45:08] about here if all of this is not correct
[45:11] up above here that we've been
[45:14] reading we don't have no right to expect
[45:17] God to answer our prayers
[45:23] amen it's a state of mind it's not just
[45:25] verb words that we're saying but look
[45:28] what it goes on to thy kingdom come now
[45:31] how long could you preach on that
[45:35] amen Jesus said it you know in in the
[45:39] church AG you start he that overcometh
[45:42] shall sit with me in my Throne as I
[45:44] overcome and sit down in my father's
[45:46] Throne see thy kingdom Throne domain thy
[45:52] kingdom come you're reminding
[45:54] God of the promise that he
[45:58] made are you
[46:01] listening when you're praying this
[46:03] prayer you're reminding him you're
[46:06] recognizing who your father is where
[46:09] your father is
[46:11] at and you're seeing his name
[46:16] right his name is
[46:20] Jesus and then you're seeing that he was
[46:23] going to have a
[46:24] kingdom yep
[46:27] so you're just reminding him so what I
[46:29] said everything we have need of is
[46:30] laying in this
[46:34] prior
[46:35] amen thy kingdom come thy will be done
[46:38] in earth as it is in
[46:50] heaven what are we talking about
[46:54] right we're talking about everything we
[46:56] have need of is in this MH give us this
[46:59] day our daily
[47:02] bread both natural and spiritual
[47:06] amen right
[47:08] y we're reminding him that he promised
[47:12] us that he give us our
[47:15] bread watch now and forgive us our
[47:19] debts our sins it
[47:23] says Luke used the word sin
[47:30] it's not debts we don't owe debts to God
[47:33] we owe him our whole life yeah that's
[47:34] right but it's
[47:38] sins forgive us our sins our
[47:41] debts as we forgive those who have
[47:44] sinned against us
[47:52] right and I'm just as honest as I can be
[47:56] but I've never tried to be nothing
[47:59] else I told you I've never tried to
[48:01] memorize the Bible and if you as me
[48:04] actually to quote the Lord's Prayer I
[48:06] would probably not be able to say it in
[48:08] this entire
[48:11] text exactly the way it's written
[48:15] right because I would translate
[48:20] sin I wouldn't say
[48:24] debts
[48:28] because to me that's what it's talking
[48:31] about but it's talking about deaths and
[48:33] other words we owe God everything and
[48:35] then we forgive our
[48:37] debtors those who owe
[48:45] us everything we have need of lead us
[48:49] not into
[48:53] temptation is that a wonderful
[48:56] prayer amen lead us not into
[49:02] temptation but Deliver Us from
[49:05] Evil yes for thine is the kingdom and
[49:09] the power and the glory
[49:12] forever
[49:14] amen that's
[49:16] right see then we stop there then don't
[49:19] we we look at the next verse for if we
[49:23] forgive men their trespasses your heaven
[49:26] if you forgive men their trespasses your
[49:28] heavenly father will also forgive you
[49:31] but if you forgive not men their
[49:32] trespasses neither will your father
[49:34] forgive you your your
[49:41] trespasses in Mark 11 we talk about it
[49:44] being that he that sath to this mountain
[49:47] be
[49:48] moved everybody wanton to see mountains
[49:50] moved
[49:52] yeah but Mark 11 is own condition if you
[49:55] keep reading down through about verse 23
[49:57] 24 25
[50:01] 26 it says if we won't
[50:04] forgive we can't be
[50:06] forgiven right now it does not
[50:10] say if I do something to
[50:16] Danny and then I go say Danny I'm sorry
[50:20] that's what we think isn't it let them
[50:22] come and ask me to forgive them I'll
[50:24] forgive them now the Bible say that
[50:27] right the Bible says to
[50:30] forgive it don't put stipulations in
[50:33] it it don't say if they've
[50:37] asked it says
[50:39] forgive as your father in Heaven
[50:44] forgives you see what I'm talking about
[50:46] though see the Lord's priy we just want
[50:48] to section it out and read this
[50:53] part and then see what well we said well
[50:56] okay I'd rather go over here to Luke cuz
[50:57] it's just
[51:01] short but see you me they're both got to
[51:04] be explaining the same thing
[51:07] right so Luke says teach us teach us
[51:10] they did to pray Jesus said okay after
[51:12] this
[51:15] manner after what Manner Matthew 1
[51:19] through what down to verse
[51:24] n
[51:27] cuz prayer is a state of mind right it's
[51:31] not words that's correct
[51:35] amen we use
[51:39] words and like I say now we say but now
[51:43] but brother Dale we we uh we're just
[51:46] praying to the one inside of
[51:48] us well now do you pray to the one
[51:51] inside of
[51:53] me right then now we're going to get
[51:56] downwards itue for a while
[51:59] right do you pray to the one that's
[52:02] inside of
[52:03] me if all you're going to say is you're
[52:06] going to pray to the one that's inside
[52:07] of
[52:09] you brother Gary what would be the
[52:11] problem then me praying to the one's
[52:13] inside of you if I can only just going
[52:14] to pray that the once's inside of me
[52:16] because if one's inside of me is inside
[52:18] of you then I can pray to the one's
[52:20] inside of you and you can pray the one
[52:21] inside of me but we don't do that do
[52:24] we
[52:27] and to show you how that we get to the
[52:32] point we say well I don't have to pray
[52:36] outwardly that's
[52:39] fine I just pray
[52:42] inwardly you get sick enough and you'll
[52:44] start praying
[52:46] outwardly
[52:48] right you get sick enough you'll cry out
[52:51] for somebody else to pray for
[52:53] you righten and you'll sure start
[52:56] praying out loud cuz you want to make
[52:59] sure that that time that you're needing
[53:01] something that bad that you want to make
[53:03] sure you get in good
[53:06] contact all right so we to
[53:10] understand you can pray all day and not
[53:12] say a word outward it right right amen
[53:16] fine that's right but then sometimes you
[53:19] pray
[53:21] outwardly just make sure it's not to be
[53:24] seen M to be
[53:28] heard a lot of you that listen to
[53:30] Brother Richard then he'll hear this and
[53:31] they they'll probably either life at me
[53:33] or scorned me one but you know we've
[53:36] we've complained two or three times to
[53:37] them about it that their takes was kind
[53:39] of weak with the main point we meant was
[53:41] was was the beginning of their tapes
[53:44] would would be low well there's one
[53:49] thing about it brother Richard and
[53:50] brother Steven don't holler screaming
[53:51] loud out to God you know for him to hear
[53:53] their prayers cuz they pray low and then
[53:56] start preaching
[53:57] loud they hear that till right either
[54:02] life or something about it because
[54:03] that's what they do every one of them
[54:05] they pray low and then when they start
[54:07] preaching they preach loud you don't
[54:09] have to turn the volume up but when
[54:10] they're praying you got to turn the
[54:11] volume up to hear well that's
[54:13] wonderful you know that's that's not
[54:15] being making it to be where that you got
[54:17] to scream and holler for God to hear
[54:22] you it's honor and respect
[54:29] and not doing things to be seen
[54:33] right that's right see talking to
[54:40] God man done at work one time telling
[54:42] about this fell said they had him to
[54:43] pray and said oh said he he prayed such
[54:46] a pretty prayer he said I thought my
[54:49] Lord them beautiful words that man's are
[54:51] praying he said he looked up to see if
[54:53] he's praying he said the Rascal was
[54:55] reading it off now that's what he said
[54:57] reading he said he was reading it well
[55:00] that's all
[55:02] right you know right out the alphabet
[55:05] God knows the words cuz we just read a
[55:07] scripture that he knows what we have
[55:09] need
[55:10] of get in the
[55:14] alphabet but you see it's a state of
[55:18] mind get in the right state of mind and
[55:22] you don't even have to say Jesus Jesus
[55:24] Jesus
[55:25] why because he knows what you're
[55:28] doing
[55:32] amen now Jesus never prayed a prayer and
[55:36] said Jesus I say this in Jesus name
[55:40] right right and are you with
[55:43] me he didn't pray a prayer and say I say
[55:46] this in Jesus
[55:48] name but he prayed to the
[55:52] father
[55:54] right
[55:55] one office or one manifestation
[55:57] communicating with the others to carry
[55:59] things on right not
[56:04] trinitarianism but he never prayed in
[56:06] jesus' name right but he told us
[56:09] to and at that
[56:12] day when the Revelation
[56:15] comes we really know how to
[56:18] pray that's right so they took that name
[56:21] of Jesus and it sounds just like that
[56:23] that down in the dark that they lost the
[56:26] name the brother around would say
[56:28] that what's he
[56:31] saying you mean they forgot to call him
[56:33] Jesus they called him Joe or or
[56:35] something else you
[56:37] know no it was the liking of the
[56:41] revelation of the name that's right is
[56:44] what the problem was cuz they thought it
[56:46] was
[56:48] trinitarianism they lost the revelation
[56:50] of the name not the name they could
[56:52] pronounce
[56:53] it
[56:56] brother Randon made a statement one time
[56:57] and it really amazed me he said I never
[57:00] prayed a
[57:01] prayer that God didn't answer
[57:04] me he said now sometimes he told me I
[57:07] couldn't have
[57:09] it you
[57:12] know you ever noticed him praying like
[57:14] that he said I never prayed a prayer God
[57:16] didn't
[57:17] answer I thought Lord how many times
[57:19] have I prayed so much but you know what
[57:21] that DED on me one
[57:23] day what the man was saying
[57:27] right and you know I've never prayed a
[57:29] prayer that God didn't answer me that's
[57:31] right
[57:33] righten why because all of the other
[57:35] times I was just using words I was just
[57:37] talking
[57:39] y but when it's really sincere in your
[57:42] heart and you get down before God in the
[57:45] right state of your mind toward him
[57:47] he'll hear you
[57:49] right and he'll answer
[57:52] you might not be right when you want it
[57:55] but he'll answer
[57:58] you you understand what I'm getting at
[58:01] that's
[58:03] right here in Matthew we see the
[58:08] setting that brings ourselves into the
[58:10] place that we can actually
[58:16] pray the right attitude the right
[58:22] setting then we can say John 17 where it
[58:26] says I send to my father and your father
[58:29] to my God and your
[58:33] God then it all works out real good
[58:36] don't
[58:37] it see Matthew then explains our
[58:42] attitude because this is right after the
[58:46] Beatitudes right right Beatitudes the
[58:49] fifth chapter right of Matthew this is
[58:52] right after the Beatitudes in the sixth
[58:54] chapter that is explaining
[58:57] it and telling us how to
[59:03] pray Luke covers what the Lord said in
[59:08] verbal
[59:10] words you right verbal
[59:14] words whereas Matthew covers the
[59:18] attitude leading up to where that those
[59:21] verbal words will be accepted
[59:27] you see how important our lives
[59:31] are see they asked him to teach him to
[59:35] pray as he
[59:40] prayed other words we know your prayers
[59:43] have been
[59:44] answered so not teach us to pray that
[59:51] way they knew God heard him or the
[59:54] father heard just say that way where you
[59:55] keep it in mind and they knew the father
[59:58] had answered his
[1:00:03] prayers don't we want to ask don't we
[1:00:06] want to pray that
[1:00:07] way
[1:00:10] right in the Lord's Prayer then is a
[1:00:14] summing up of all the things that we
[1:00:18] have need of
[1:00:21] Amen to cover the kingdom to cover the
[1:00:24] the healings the signs the Wonder
[1:00:26] everything is in the Lord's Prayer so no
[1:00:28] wonder the devil has to back
[1:00:30] off when the Lord's Prayer is said not
[1:00:33] by verbatim
[1:00:35] words but when the Lord's Prayer is said
[1:00:38] from a heart of an individual that
[1:00:40] realizes what that's taking
[1:00:43] place you're reminding god of what he
[1:00:48] said just like a little woman there I
[1:00:50] always think of it like this you
[1:00:52] remember the little woman there in the
[1:00:53] scripture you know
[1:00:58] that he said but the
[1:01:02] crumbs she said but the crumbs when they
[1:01:04] fall off of the master's table said we
[1:01:06] dogs y are allowed to eat
[1:01:11] them he said he didn't find so much
[1:01:13] faith in
[1:01:15] Israel cuz you know what reminded him
[1:01:17] what he come to do right it reminded him
[1:01:19] that he come to bring in a gentile
[1:01:21] dispensation that's right and the dog
[1:01:26] dos would come to become the children of
[1:01:29] God right amen reminded
[1:01:34] him you ever heard brother brandom
[1:01:36] emphasizing there in the scripture where
[1:01:38] that the the the the woman you know said
[1:01:40] thy son of David have mercy on me and he
[1:01:42] wouldn't even listen to
[1:01:45] her he said she had no right to call him
[1:01:48] that but said when she said my Lord amen
[1:01:52] said he was her Lord
[1:01:55] she got what she asked for amen but she
[1:01:58] had to change it from son of David
[1:02:00] didn't she y That's right well now what
[1:02:03] do you mean God know when she started
[1:02:05] praying like that who she was what she
[1:02:07] talking about yeah but he wanted her to
[1:02:09] pray
[1:02:11] right he wants us to pray he wants us to
[1:02:14] say
[1:02:16] right see to recognize truly who our
[1:02:19] father
[1:02:20] is is what I'm trying to get us to
[1:02:23] see
[1:02:26] now Jesus prayed to his
[1:02:30] father and he said our father
[1:02:35] was the same father his
[1:02:39] father then we pray for who how do we
[1:02:46] pray Our Father which are in
[1:02:50] heaven we pray to our father don't we we
[1:02:54] don't pray to Jesus to ask him to
[1:02:57] intercede with the
[1:03:00] father right we pray to the father and
[1:03:04] end our prayers in Jesus name amen cuz
[1:03:07] that's what he said
[1:03:10] do you ever noticed
[1:03:13] that let's see I think I didn't hear but
[1:03:15] I know the reason I thought on this is
[1:03:18] what brought it to me that brother
[1:03:20] brandham would say he said
[1:03:23] father he said I thank you that you sent
[1:03:27] your
[1:03:28] son sure to die in my place am where he
[1:03:32] could come and heal me and things like
[1:03:35] that he was a trinitarian was
[1:03:37] he but he was
[1:03:40] recognizing all the positions that it
[1:03:43] took to bring into being that he could
[1:03:45] make that
[1:03:49] prayer but you know I've never found him
[1:03:51] say
[1:03:53] this I've never heard him say Jesus I'm
[1:03:56] glad your father sent you
[1:04:01] right now if it is I'm you know I can be
[1:04:04] corrected I'm just making a point about
[1:04:07] cuz you see that would be getting too
[1:04:08] close to to people wouldn't
[1:04:12] it we're asked to say father I thank you
[1:04:16] right that you sent your son to die in
[1:04:18] my place we know what happened there
[1:04:21] don't we amen see what I'm saying about
[1:04:23] the re reation of the hour and times
[1:04:25] where we are and what we're doing at
[1:04:27] that day cuz then we're knowing and
[1:04:30] realizing that God came down
[1:04:32] himself that's right to die in our place
[1:04:37] am but see if you turn it around the
[1:04:39] other way and say son I thank
[1:04:44] you that the father sent you down that
[1:04:46] would be another
[1:04:49] person that's how easy it is to cross it
[1:04:53] up
[1:04:55] see what are you
[1:05:00] doing what are we doing just get over
[1:05:03] here and get
[1:05:07] through at that
[1:05:11] day then you'll
[1:05:14] know
[1:05:16] see at that day John
[1:05:20] 16:23 he says you'll ask me
[1:05:23] nothing
[1:05:26] now look what he's
[1:05:28] saying you need to read that scripture
[1:05:31] look it up John
[1:05:33] 16:23 at that day you don't need to ask
[1:05:37] me nothing he
[1:05:41] said but he said whatsoever you ask the
[1:05:44] father or something like believe
[1:05:46] this in my name
[1:05:50] y so we're the only people who have
[1:05:54] outside of coming down from the
[1:05:58] disciples it was lost down to the ages
[1:06:00] the revelation of the name not the name
[1:06:03] itself but the Revelation what was going
[1:06:06] on but see now we have the name
[1:06:09] restored cuz it was restored back there
[1:06:12] in the on the right before zeusa Street
[1:06:14] or right in that period of time that the
[1:06:16] name of Jesus was restored why is the
[1:06:19] prophet using that the name of Jesus he
[1:06:21] called the Bible calls the name of Jesus
[1:06:23] an Open Door
[1:06:25] a revelation of who he
[1:06:29] is and see then who do you pray
[1:06:38] to you said well God knows who he is
[1:06:42] brother
[1:06:45] Dale why would I be concerned about
[1:06:52] it I'm glad you thought thought of
[1:06:55] that cuz you see you just lost a whole
[1:07:05] thing he knows who he is right why would
[1:07:09] it not be all right to call him right
[1:07:15] Jehovah why would it not be all right to
[1:07:18] call him Yahweh yep H
[1:07:22] him you see we
[1:07:25] know the
[1:07:28] scripture ask anything in my name see
[1:07:31] and we're not going to pray our prayers
[1:07:33] in the name of Jehovah
[1:07:36] right we're not going to pray our
[1:07:38] prayers and end them with Yahweh or
[1:07:41] Elohim
[1:07:43] or we're not going to do that are
[1:07:46] we you
[1:07:48] see he does know who he
[1:07:52] is but he wants wants us to know who he
[1:07:54] is right that's
[1:07:58] right I sitting around my house and
[1:08:01] somebody says well
[1:08:06] poppy well you know everybody in there
[1:08:08] knows who I
[1:08:11] am but that's the not not the right
[1:08:14] title for my sons and daughters to use
[1:08:17] son in-law's daughter-in-law they use
[1:08:19] them because that's
[1:08:22] respect it's not the title for my wife
[1:08:25] to use
[1:08:29] right the correct title for my wife is
[1:08:32] what husband it's not
[1:08:35] father a children is Father not husband
[1:08:38] how many times You' been through that
[1:08:39] with the prophet
[1:08:43] listening and then why why wouldn't he
[1:08:46] he knew he was the son of David why
[1:08:48] would he not why would not he answer
[1:08:51] that lady's prayer
[1:08:55] when she said Son of David have mercy on
[1:08:59] me he knew who he
[1:09:02] was he said well what's all this about
[1:09:04] the name of Jesus and all the God knows
[1:09:07] who he is we just call him
[1:09:13] God and that can be an object of worship
[1:09:16] right right
[1:09:20] y so we'll pray tonight so we'll say God
[1:09:23] would you come down and heal this person
[1:09:24] we ask it in God's
[1:09:26] name now we're not going to do that are
[1:09:28] we
[1:09:32] right who do you pray
[1:09:35] toen the one that's inside of
[1:09:39] you this is a background for another M
[1:09:42] seat all
[1:09:44] right it won't be Sunday morning but who
[1:09:48] do you pray
[1:09:51] to I pray to my father
[1:09:56] amen right
[1:09:58] amen and while I'm on Earth I use the
[1:10:01] name of Jesus
[1:10:03] right cuz I say in Jesus name
[1:10:09] am you ever notice the the Baptist
[1:10:12] especially they'll say they won't say in
[1:10:15] Jesus name they they'll say for Christ's
[1:10:19] sake you ever been around and watch them
[1:10:22] in the name of the Holy One or or
[1:10:24] Christ's sake they won't say in the name
[1:10:26] of Jesus so that's what caught me when I
[1:10:28] was in the Baptist Church and and you
[1:10:32] know I began to talk to the preacher a
[1:10:36] little bit about the name of
[1:10:38] Jesus and didn't mention much to him one
[1:10:40] but this I think it was him or maybe
[1:10:42] somebody came in but anyhow that was the
[1:10:44] way it hit me and doed on me I had to go
[1:10:46] get baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:10:47] Jesus Christ cuz the preacher got up
[1:10:49] there and I knew the Baptist didn't
[1:10:50] believe in doing it that way he said now
[1:10:52] that's the way we all pray for Christ's
[1:10:54] sake he said from now on let's do what
[1:10:57] the Bible says pray in jesus' name and
[1:11:00] you know what the whole church turned
[1:11:02] around started praying in Jesus
[1:11:06] name but you know what I
[1:11:08] done I said Thank You Lord I'm heading
[1:11:12] to the water as fast as I can
[1:11:14] go because I saw Jesus
[1:11:18] name yep to the others it just meant a
[1:11:21] verbal word to change it from Christ
[1:11:24] sake you watch it around it you know you
[1:11:27] watch how people will pray they'll say
[1:11:29] you know for Christ's sake or in the
[1:11:31] name of the Holy One or or something
[1:11:33] like that or father in thy name or
[1:11:39] something that you
[1:11:43] see do we pray to our
[1:11:46] father
[1:11:48] right now I'm asking you the question me
[1:11:51] too do we pray to our father
[1:11:54] or are we still tied up and don't
[1:11:56] exactly know who our father
[1:12:04] is could we be we be approaching him
[1:12:13] wrong that's why people are all looking
[1:12:15] for a new name
[1:12:19] right we don't need to try to worry
[1:12:21] about a new name until we bring in to
[1:12:24] the point of understanding in the name
[1:12:25] of
[1:12:28] Jesus that's right and unless we take it
[1:12:31] on the order of what Matthew says about
[1:12:33] it the the the way of laying it down to
[1:12:37] come to that place for giving and and
[1:12:39] doing and not praying outwardly and not
[1:12:41] do you know loud and and not being seen
[1:12:43] of men and not doing our arms just just
[1:12:47] be I don't even worried about your
[1:12:51] name but I've always told you as honest
[1:12:54] and I could be about it what if it's not
[1:12:56] a different name but just something
[1:12:58] about the name of Jesus that we don't
[1:13:00] understand
[1:13:03] amen see that way I'm not saying that
[1:13:05] there's not a new name coming I believe
[1:13:08] there will be because every day is a new
[1:13:10] revelation to me that's right every day
[1:13:12] I see more of the name of
[1:13:14] Jesus don't you
[1:13:17] amen compared to where you started at
[1:13:20] that don't you see more of a day of than
[1:13:22] new name the name of Jesus
[1:13:25] amen but you see everybody wants some
[1:13:27] kind of a something to be able to
[1:13:31] say and they even said it about brother
[1:13:33] Brandon said his mouth was formed a
[1:13:35] certain way so he could speak that word
[1:13:38] what's the form of your mouth I go this
[1:13:40] way and say Jesus I go way and say Jes
[1:13:41] Jesus what it comes out the same right
[1:13:45] that's
[1:13:46] right see it's just some kind of
[1:13:49] a something that's makes it where no
[1:13:53] nobody else can't do
[1:13:56] it cuz we'd have to all find out about
[1:13:59] what to know just like one man told
[1:14:01] Brother mo one time he said said but
[1:14:03] said you talk to people that said but
[1:14:05] they never seen brother brandom said we
[1:14:07] seen him said when he'd say them things
[1:14:09] and them gestures he'd make and them way
[1:14:12] that he'd say it said if you didn't see
[1:14:14] that you wouldn't know what he's talking
[1:14:16] about well I didn't know gestures change
[1:14:20] the words on the
[1:14:21] tape right you
[1:14:25] know but who do you pray
[1:14:33] to I've told you over and over that to
[1:14:35] me when I look back there and I see him
[1:14:38] and I can see Jesus Christ all the way
[1:14:40] through the Bible
[1:14:43] right I see Jesus Christ all the way
[1:14:45] through the Old Testament I can see
[1:14:47] Jesus Christ back there in the in the
[1:14:50] garden as the creator of God Amen but
[1:14:52] I'm not talking about
[1:14:54] Jesus I'm talking about Jesus Christ who
[1:14:57] is almighty God
[1:15:00] Amen see I can stand here and say then
[1:15:04] Jesus Christ would you
[1:15:06] come and lead
[1:15:08] us cuz I know who I'm talking
[1:15:12] about if you could you can say
[1:15:15] Jesus and if you know who you're talking
[1:15:20] about the state of mind has brought you
[1:15:22] to the place that you know that you're
[1:15:24] talking about Jesus who is almighty
[1:15:27] God right and that there's never been
[1:15:29] another name but
[1:15:33] Jesus
[1:15:35] right see then that's not Jesus
[1:15:41] only this recognize in the revelation of
[1:15:43] the hour that we're living who do you
[1:15:45] pray to well I pray to the one inside of
[1:15:47] me I hope that illustration brought out
[1:15:49] a while ago will help on that you know
[1:15:51] that when we get sick we start Str
[1:15:53] screaming we don't pray to the one
[1:15:55] inside of us all the
[1:15:57] time and the illustration of where that
[1:16:00] do you pray to the one inside of
[1:16:03] me no sister Gail you pray to the one
[1:16:05] inside of you don't you you ain't trying
[1:16:08] to contact the one inside of me
[1:16:13] right I'm trying to get you to see what
[1:16:16] it means to
[1:16:18] pray we think it's
[1:16:20] words but it's a state of mind that you
[1:16:23] live in y that you can pray all
[1:16:28] day pray without
[1:16:34] ceasing but then you
[1:16:37] pray we call on somebody to dismiss or
[1:16:40] something they don't pray inside of them
[1:16:42] do
[1:16:43] they you pray outwardly
[1:16:47] right who do you pray
[1:16:52] to
[1:16:56] like I said brother brandom would say
[1:16:58] father I thank you that you sent your
[1:17:02] son but we don't believe that's
[1:17:05] trinitarianism right we know that that
[1:17:08] means exactly what it said that God came
[1:17:11] down in a form
[1:17:18] y who do you pray
[1:17:20] to Jesus had a father and prayed to his
[1:17:25] father
[1:17:28] y it's written in the Bible where he was
[1:17:31] in the garden and the prayer that he
[1:17:33] made that Lord this cup might pass from
[1:17:37] me so evidently somebody heard it cuz
[1:17:41] that's what they wrote
[1:17:44] down I hope you understand what I'm
[1:17:47] saying prayer is a state of
[1:17:50] mind and you can live in that
[1:17:55] that's where our trouble it is when we
[1:17:56] don't live
[1:18:00] in that's why the prophet said Angels
[1:18:02] don't come to
[1:18:06] us because of our state of
[1:18:10] mind but who do you pray
[1:18:13] to I pray to my
[1:18:18] father and I know where my father is at
[1:18:20] he's in
[1:18:21] heaven
[1:18:23] I know also that the Holy Ghost is here
[1:18:26] and I know that that the Christ is
[1:18:31] here leading us and guiding
[1:18:35] us the key to the whole thing is what it
[1:18:38] says in the Book of Revelations to me
[1:18:40] where John said I was in the spirit on
[1:18:43] the Lord's Day
[1:18:48] right the prophet said the key was he
[1:18:51] was in the spirit mhm
[1:18:55] nothing else wouldn't have been worth
[1:18:58] nothing but you
[1:19:00] see while we're here in this world we
[1:19:05] ask the
[1:19:10] father
[1:19:12] right in Jesus
[1:19:17] name cuz that's giving him back then
[1:19:19] every title every thought if your mind
[1:19:22] is in in the right
[1:19:23] order every thought every mind every
[1:19:26] point is like I said about what it is
[1:19:29] for the Lord's
[1:19:31] Prayer you're reminding him of
[1:19:34] everything he promised
[1:19:37] you when you use the name of
[1:19:42] Jesus cuz you're reminding him of all he
[1:19:45] went through to bring that name into
[1:19:49] being upon the Earth right not as to
[1:19:52] letters J esus cuz the prophet said that
[1:19:54] is used before and many times after said
[1:19:56] there's many jesuses in the days of the
[1:19:59] Lord Jesus but there was only one Lord
[1:20:02] Jesus Christ
[1:20:04] amen there was only one almighty god
[1:20:06] let's Stand Together come on
[1:20:11] musician think on these
[1:20:16] things think on these
[1:20:19] things who do you pray to
[1:20:29] I pray to my
[1:20:31] father I know my father's name
[1:20:35] though his name is
[1:20:39] Jesus when you see it like that brother
[1:20:41] R said if you don't see Christ in every
[1:20:42] verse he didn't say Jesus cuz you don't
[1:20:45] see the j s us s but you see Christ in
[1:20:49] every
[1:20:50] verse and you can go back and read it
[1:20:52] but see one day we'll see Jesus never
[1:20:54] verse right and we see the who the
[1:20:57] Christ really
[1:21:00] is almighty
[1:21:03] God think on these things just a little
[1:21:06] thought what we got 237 in spiral book

[1:21:12] need CU you see I believe in that name

[1:25:25] turning the fire is
[1:25:28] burning
[1:25:32] Jesus amen this is the
[1:25:36] day this is the day that the Lord has
[1:25:42] that the
[1:25:44] Lord we will
[1:25:46] rej We
[1:25:48] willj and
[1:25:51] glad Go been revealed to
[1:25:54] us this is the day that
[1:25:59] the we will rej and be
[1:26:04] glad this is the day this is the day
[1:26:09] that the Lord has
[1:26:13] made this is the day
[1:26:17] right today that the
[1:26:20] Lord that the Lord
[1:26:24] we will
[1:26:26] rejoice we will rejoice and be
[1:26:30] glad and be
[1:26:33] glad this is the day that the Lord
[1:26:38] has
[1:26:40] will he made a day you know he made a
[1:26:43] people for the
[1:26:48] day he made a day but he made a people
[1:26:50] for the day you know nobody can't I
[1:26:53] listen we was the other day we brother
[1:26:55] around and said nobody can't take your
[1:26:59] place he said but you can't take nobody
[1:27:01] else's place
[1:27:03] either you know God chose us for a
[1:27:06] reason now I don't understand it I'm
[1:27:09] honest what he need me for right but yet
[1:27:13] there was a reason
[1:27:16] right that's right and Satan can't get
[1:27:18] us till he gets through with the reason
[1:27:20] he's got for all of us
[1:27:22] then why are we worried about it we're
[1:27:24] not
[1:27:25] concerned but see this is the day to
[1:27:28] understand going if you notice I just
[1:27:31] quo in the scriptures but run that in
[1:27:33] and just look in the concordance at that
[1:27:36] day we just used the one in John 20
[1:27:40] where brother R said that means this day
[1:27:42] but just look at all the time it says
[1:27:44] that
[1:27:45] day at that day you won't ask me
[1:27:51] nothing
[1:27:54] cuz you realize who you're talking to so
[1:27:57] it evidently means that maybe we think
[1:27:59] we're talking to the wrong person
[1:28:02] sometimes maybe we have our mind
[1:28:04] connected in speaking to the wrong
[1:28:10] one of course we we would never admit it
[1:28:13] but maybe we are like the
[1:28:16] Catholics they want to talk to Mary to
[1:28:18] get her to talk to Jesus to where he can
[1:28:20] talk to God Holy Ghost then it can go on
[1:28:23] to
[1:28:24] God you see we're not in that
[1:28:27] day we're in the day to understand who
[1:28:30] we're talking
[1:28:31] to and who we're talking
[1:28:34] about and his name is
[1:28:37] Jesus be the lord
