[1:46] thing I don't know about putting the
[1:47] board up put it down so low because of
[1:49] this
[1:50] thing to be
[1:54] about well I may take and put the board
[1:56] on that easel like we use up
[1:58] there anyway all right let's go
[2:01] Revelation chapter
[2:03] 6 now we've been talking for since the
[2:07] first of the year we've been on the
[2:09] breach started through the first seal
[2:12] and got into some things and uh talking
[2:16] about iniquity and man of sin we're
[2:19] going to read Revelation 6 kind of just
[2:21] back up we had done this in a couple
[2:22] weeks but just back up and I saw when
[2:24] the lamb opened one of the seals I heard
[2:26] it was the noise of Thunder one of the
[2:28] four beasts saying come and see and we
[2:32] know who that Beast was right what was
[2:34] that
[2:35] Beast
[2:37] somebody lion thank you the lion all
[2:41] right lion ox man and Eagle we're going
[2:44] to go back through that again for those
[2:46] of you that are fresh here good to see
[2:48] sister Vanessa with us today morning
[2:50] with us and just for thoughts in your
[2:53] mind we're we're going to take the
[2:56] natural aspect of the seal the spiritual
[2:58] aspect of the seal and the literal
[3:00] opening of the seal when we're gone all
[3:03] right and also take the combat Beast
[3:06] each horse each power we've been on the
[3:08] White
[3:10] Horse and I saw and behold a white horse
[3:12] and he that sat on him had a
[3:14] bow and a crown was given remember we
[3:18] talked about Satan he has no power well
[3:21] jeel was speaking of a little bit last
[3:23] night but Satan has to be given power
[3:27] all down through here I've circled all
[3:28] to given power was given now when Jesus
[3:31] resurrected what did he say all power in
[3:33] heaven and earth been given unto me so
[3:35] everybody else and every other thing is
[3:39] powerless there's nothing more powerful
[3:41] than that man or Eli right so he had to
[3:45] permit or give power to the devil
[3:48] actually he doesn't do it we do it we're
[3:51] the ones that give Satan the power all
[3:54] right and power was given unto him and
[3:56] he went forth conquering and to conquer
[3:59] in other words he was conquering in that
[4:01] day and to conquer means brother randam
[4:04] said that man got on that white horse
[4:06] rode through the church ages got off
[4:08] that horse got on another horse but that
[4:10] horse kept on going that horse was a
[4:12] power the people gave that horse that
[4:14] power which was the white righteous
[4:16] Church all right and like we said a
[4:19] couple of Sundays ago I want you to see
[4:21] that there was a white righteous
[4:24] Church Paul Peter that was a white
[4:27] righteous church right the True Vine but
[4:32] there was a false Vine that wanted to be
[4:33] righteous too they wanted to look light
[4:35] and they wanted to you know power had to
[4:37] be given to them they had a bow no
[4:39] arrows in other words they had they had
[4:41] something to do during that time but
[4:42] they couldn't they had no effect on the
[4:46] people power was given unto him and he
[4:48] went forth conquering and to conquer now
[4:51] let's go to Second
[4:54] Thessalonians cuz we
[4:57] know from the teaching of the word of
[4:59] God
[5:01] that when brother random went come to
[5:04] that first
[5:07] deal we know the white horse
[5:10] rider became
[5:13] exposed and we use that word reveal and
[5:15] I said you know remember we we use that
[5:18] word too
[5:19] Loosely um I don't want a revelation of
[5:22] the
[5:24] devil I want a revelation of Jesus
[5:26] Christ so much that it exposes is the
[5:29] devil but if I get more of a revelation
[5:32] of who Jesus Christ is in my life that
[5:34] exposes what the devil's doing and it
[5:36] drives him out that's why that white
[5:38] horse was riding
[5:40] away brother R said here stands a lamb
[5:43] with a book in his hand and there goes a
[5:44] white horse rider he was riding away he
[5:47] was riding away from something all right
[5:50] so now second
[5:54] Thessalonians we understand that
[5:58] uh
[6:00] that truly the symbols watch this person
[6:04] we're going to go from symbols which is
[6:06] horses and things like that so this is
[6:08] the man this is the man you're talking
[6:10] about here because it's not it's not a
[6:12] symbol of sin it's not a it's not White
[6:16] Horse this is the man of sin this is the
[6:19] person all
[6:21] right chapter 2 now we beseech ye
[6:23] Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus
[6:25] Christ and by our gathering together
[6:27] unto him that you be not soon shaken in
[6:31] mind or be troubled neither by Spirit
[6:34] nor by word nor by letter as from us as
[6:36] that the day of Christ is at hand not a
[6:40] day like the guy prophesied yesterday
[6:42] that we were going to you know that was
[6:44] the day of the Lord and we were going
[6:48] home well we didn't go home we
[6:51] understand one thing for sure no man
[6:53] knows the day or the hour and if you set
[6:55] one day as a day you broke the scripture
[6:58] and you can't break the scripture
[6:59] regardless of what the prophet said
[7:01] regardless of all the other things how
[7:02] this is going to happen if any man sets
[7:05] a
[7:06] day brother ra said you may know the
[7:08] week or the
[7:09] month but see they're not setting week
[7:12] month prophecies they're setting
[7:14] days CU you cannot set a day the Bible
[7:16] says no man will know the day or the
[7:19] hour all right that's why even brother
[7:21] Brown says between 6 and 9 see there's
[7:23] no way brother R could have come out and
[7:25] said oh it's going to happen at 7:00 no
[7:28] he'd know the hour he hadn't break
[7:30] scripture it's from 6:00 to 9:00 in the
[7:33] morning you have a lap in there of time
[7:35] that no man knows but we
[7:39] will I was just wondering it's 6 to9
[7:42] when it's here in the states it's not
[7:44] that hour across the world and I was
[7:46] wondering because he was a an American
[7:48] prophet he was
[7:51] 69 I think so I think the Rapture will
[7:54] start here I
[7:57] just I don't know that's just my thought
[8:00] but the man said he got everything out
[8:02] of scpt oh yeah he went through Daniel
[8:04] 70 weeks and the whole works I mean he
[8:05] was he was nailing it right down to the
[8:08] day be
[8:10] like and everybody wouldn't know it
[8:12] that's right that's why everybody knows
[8:14] a little bit of the word of God but we
[8:16] had a Prophet come that knew all the
[8:17] word
[8:18] God he put it together and I put my
[8:20] dependence not on just that man William
[8:22] Brandon but God speaking through that
[8:24] man to me okay he was a vessel he was a
[8:27] mute trumpet okay he actually yielded
[8:32] hisself so much to God till God actually
[8:34] used that
[8:35] man let no man deceive you by any means
[8:38] for that day what the day of Christ
[8:41] shall not come except there come a
[8:42] falling away first now we talked about
[8:44] that you see the and looking yesterday
[8:48] we saw 155 people or more here in this
[8:51] church and you see that churches are
[8:54] growing and and sister Vanessa said that
[8:56] she come from church you know 3 400
[8:58] people 300 people people probably beig
[9:02] Church Falling Away people is not people
[9:05] leaving church it's people coming to
[9:07] church thinking they're saved thinking
[9:10] they're born again and they're in the
[9:12] message because this man of sin is not
[9:15] being made known in a lot of places all
[9:17] right not saying anything about big
[9:19] churches or little churches but I told
[9:21] somebody the other day somebody said
[9:22] something about a church I said well
[9:24] Jesus God himself only had 12 and one of
[9:26] them was the devil First Church
[9:29] God set up the first church with 12
[9:31] people and one of them was the devil so
[9:33] guess what we ain't going to do any
[9:35] better all right but for that day shall
[9:39] not come except there come a falling
[9:40] away
[9:42] first and that man of sin be revealed
[9:46] the son of predition how is he going to
[9:48] be revealed or made
[9:50] known by this message this message is
[9:53] the only word of God powerful enough you
[9:57] say powerful enough yeah they had the
[9:59] the word of God down through the Through
[10:00] the Ages but they only had a little
[10:02] portion we got the whole portion who
[10:05] opposes and exalted himself above all
[10:08] that is called God or that is worshiped
[10:11] so that he as
[10:13] God as
[10:15] God sitting in the temple of God now
[10:17] where's the temple of God it's not some
[10:19] Dwelling it's not this building it's not
[10:20] four wall the only Temple that God is
[10:23] worried about is the one that you
[10:25] brought with you today that you washed
[10:26] and put on clothes and all that okay
[10:29] all right when you say Temple and going
[10:32] to prepare place and you look at all
[10:33] these
[10:34] Mansions it's you a body thou has
[10:38] prepared Me Not Just for Jesus Christ he
[10:40] did the same with you and I okay so that
[10:43] he as God sth in the temp sth is th
[10:47] that's an ongoing thing so he's not just
[10:48] going to stop showing himself that he
[10:53] is God now the only way he can get his
[10:56] perfect anti- anointing is in this
[10:58] message
[11:01] he's got to watch and see what's going
[11:03] on in this message cu no other people on
[11:05] the face of the Earth has ever had the
[11:07] word of God open as pure as you and I
[11:09] see it so that man of sin is not sitting
[11:13] in a Budweiser
[11:14] joint or down at the prostitute house he
[11:18] comes to church more than most of us do
[11:20] in a message Church okay he never misses
[11:24] a day he's always in my brain when when
[11:27] when I walk in sister Vanessa it's not
[11:29] that we're not
[11:31] immune but remember what we do we cast
[11:33] down reasoning we cast down imagination
[11:35] we cast down these things remember you
[11:37] not that when I was yet with you I told
[11:39] you these
[11:40] things Paul was trying to get the people
[11:43] to understand Jesus Christ was not
[11:44] coming during his time he knew that he
[11:47] was a prophet now this Prophet this was
[11:49] the alpha Prophet which knew he wasn't
[11:51] coming at the end at that time but the
[11:53] Omega Prophet brother randam knew he was
[11:55] coming cuz there was no more Church ages
[11:57] Paul could see other ages when when Paul
[11:59] said I look through a glass Darkly he
[12:00] was prophesying something to come
[12:04] brother brandom didn't prophesy
[12:05] something to come he went across a
[12:06] curtain of time he preached the future
[12:08] home he preached it right up to our
[12:10] eternity Paul didn't Paul could look and
[12:13] maybe see part of it but he couldn't
[12:15] understand it like you and I I've always
[12:17] said that uh those great saints that
[12:19] went on they're going to look for you
[12:23] when you tell them you come from this
[12:24] loud of seeing age they're going to want
[12:25] to sit down and talk to you and ask you
[12:27] how you did that's right how in the
[12:29] world did you make it through the most
[12:32] vile super religious age that ever was
[12:36] they're going to want to ask you and
[12:37] find out how you made it
[12:39] through cuz the seals were not revealed
[12:42] to anybody in any age until this age
[12:45] right here and that was what man was
[12:48] looking at Paul could look right at him
[12:51] but he could not pull that seal back
[12:54] because the and it's not saying that
[12:56] Paul was a lesser Prophet Paul was a
[12:58] prophet but a great man like I said the
[13:00] alpha uh you know the
[13:03] beginning and that's why he and brother
[13:05] r on their life parallels but but there
[13:07] was a time that Paul knew there was
[13:09] another church Aid see it had to come to
[13:11] the last Church Aid brother random knew
[13:13] the seals had to open for the Redemption
[13:15] of the body because there was not
[13:16] another age for you to die off see they
[13:19] come into Paul's age they come in and
[13:21] then as Paul left he said Grievous
[13:22] wolves are going to come in they're
[13:23] going to eat away the word of God and he
[13:25] said it's going to not come from the
[13:27] outside it's going to come from here
[13:28] we're going to read that in just a
[13:30] minute but there's going to be a falling
[13:32] away well here here see he saw another
[13:34] Prophet irus come up but brother rown
[13:36] comes he says this is
[13:38] it there's no more falling away if you
[13:40] fall away it's going to be this one
[13:42] right here this great Falling Away In
[13:44] other words brother R said one time he
[13:46] said we're on an ax
[13:49] blade he
[13:50] said raise your Edge he said you slide
[13:53] off this side he said there's no way to
[13:56] come back cuz it just keeps going away
[13:58] but if you make it on this side you
[13:59] going to God you understand what I'm
[14:01] saying but see there was the falling
[14:02] away in Paul's time but the people that
[14:04] fell away there was another age sprung
[14:07] up and brought the people back up into
[14:09] the word of God there's nothing else
[14:11] people but us being caught up we're the
[14:13] caught up group okay is it falling away
[14:16] from the truth of the word it's falling
[14:18] away from the truth of the word but
[14:19] listen to this right here let me read
[14:21] this right here we're going to read this
[14:22] in just a second let me read one and now
[14:24] you know verse
[14:26] six that what withholdeth that he might
[14:28] be revealed in his time and now you know
[14:31] what withhold it he's fixing to tell us
[14:33] why it's withholding remember we talked
[14:35] about this but we going back over to
[14:37] refresh everybody's memory for the
[14:39] mystery of iniquity does already work
[14:43] now let's read this like a like somebody
[14:46] with no
[14:47] Revelation only he who now leth will let
[14:51] who Satan oh I Satan Satan's going to
[14:53] let all this happen hold that in your
[14:55] mind we know that's not right but hold
[14:56] it there until he God be taken out of
[14:59] the way are he his people no we had a
[15:02] Prophet come in the end
[15:04] time I read it to you it's on page 116
[15:08] of the seal book we read it we won't
[15:09] read it for a second time you you got
[15:11] your seal book with you he said only he
[15:15] got it took a prophet look at that
[15:17] little age God hid that from the
[15:21] people only he God who now leth will let
[15:25] in other words God let this thing go
[15:27] on until he the Bible says he little age
[15:33] but here brother R comes along God
[15:34] reveals the word to him gives him the
[15:36] give him the Love Letter the the in
[15:39] between the lines he said that's Christ
[15:41] or the bride the
[15:43] bride she is him she is him now until he
[15:48] the bride be taken out of the way and
[15:50] then shall that Wicked be revealed whom
[15:52] the Lord shall consume with what the
[15:55] spirit of his mouth what sharped story
[15:57] speaking of the word of God
[15:59] and shall destroy with the brightness of
[16:01] his coming remember we went to Isaiah
[16:03] and read about that in the end time that
[16:05] the moon was going to be as bright as
[16:07] the sun and the sun would be seven times
[16:10] brighter so the moon's going to be seven
[16:12] times brighter in this last day so we're
[16:15] going to shine there's no difference
[16:17] between the Sun and the Moon in the end
[16:19] time all right there's no difference in
[16:21] the sun cuz that's the sun of
[16:22] righteousness the sun you know the Moon
[16:24] is the Lesser light but the Bible tells
[16:27] us that that lesser light's going to be
[16:28] seven times brighter in the end time and
[16:31] that's in Isaiah 30 let's read that
[16:32] while while we got just a little
[16:36] time that's why brother R said one seal
[16:39] can tie the entire Bible together you
[16:41] can go through all the Bible and just
[16:43] read we're still in just the first
[16:47] seal and we're going to go to Genesis
[16:50] next week and show you how the seal
[16:53] started in Genesis all right just for
[16:56] the first
[16:57] seal and I hate this
[17:04] thing put my hand on it
[17:09] what there's no
[17:11] adjustment no that's for
[17:14] this there's not one down there I take
[17:17] to your place let you well up together
[17:20] now listen if Brother Ray ever speaks
[17:22] he'll be just
[17:26] fine all right I'm sorry Isaiah 30 just
[17:30] nose I'm going cut up anyway so I don't
[17:33] have to put on a show do I okay all
[17:36] right but now listen to this verse 26
[17:39] Chapter 30 keep our comments ourselves
[17:41] Chapter 30 verse
[17:43] 26 moreover the light of the moon shall
[17:46] be as the light of the
[17:49] sun now when is this going to happen you
[17:51] know verse 25 tells us when the towers
[17:53] fall okay that happened September 11th
[17:57] 2011 of
[17:59] 2001 see that shall be upon ever high
[18:01] mountain ever high hill rivers and
[18:03] streams of water in the day the great of
[18:05] the great Slaughter when the tow fall
[18:06] all right so the towers had to fall in
[18:08] New York first before this
[18:11] scripture brother R said this day this
[18:13] scripture is fulfilled I can tell you
[18:15] now this day this scripture it's been 10
[18:17] years since the towers that fell and
[18:19] look what happened moreover the light of
[18:22] the moon shall be as the light of the
[18:24] sun and the light of the sun shall be
[18:27] seven
[18:29] four so if the sun's going to be seven
[18:31] times brighter and the moon's going to
[18:32] be the same light as the sun here we got
[18:35] seven times brighter the
[18:38] moon as the light of seven days what
[18:41] seven Church ages and the day that the
[18:44] Lord bindeth up the what the
[18:48] breach brother preach what the breach
[18:51] between the church ages and the seal the
[18:53] breach of his people and health The
[18:55] Stroke of their wound now what great
[18:57] wound are we looking at right now
[19:00] there's only one wound and that is the
[19:03] wound of
[19:04] death death is the last thing to be
[19:06] destroyed now let's go back to Second
[19:07] Thessalonians and finish that
[19:12] up verse 8 then shall that Wicked be
[19:16] revealed whom the Lord shall consume
[19:18] with the spirit of his mouth and shall
[19:19] destroy with the brightness of his
[19:21] coming even him whose coming is after
[19:24] the working of Satan with all power
[19:26] signs and lying wonders
[19:29] and with all deceivableness of
[19:31] unrighteousness in them that perish
[19:32] because they receive here is the key
[19:35] people listen to
[19:39] this and with all deceivableness of
[19:42] unrighteousness in them that perish
[19:45] because this is why because they receive
[19:51] not the love of The Truth Listen they
[19:56] receive the truth
[19:59] they just not did they just did not see
[20:01] the love of the truth brother R said
[20:04] perfect love that's the only thing
[20:06] that's going to get you to heaven is
[20:07] perfect love and the only you know that
[20:09] like I said before all the I was
[20:11] preaching brother burle and and you know
[20:13] people people say that boy perfect love
[20:16] brother R's got to come back and give us
[20:17] all perfect love when brother Brown went
[20:20] across a curtain a time there was short
[20:22] people tall people white people black
[20:25] people all different colors they were
[20:27] different sister Vanessa were different
[20:29] but they only have one thing in common
[20:30] that angel come around and stood and
[20:32] brother BR said are all these brandom he
[20:34] said no he said well how did they get
[20:35] here he said they all have perfect love
[20:39] so what did they all have what was it
[20:41] all in common in the sixth Dimension
[20:43] doesn't matter if you're short don't
[20:45] matter if you got a lot of understanding
[20:46] don't matter if you got a little bit of
[20:47] understanding don't matter if you're a
[20:48] great scholar if you're born again
[20:51] that's the only thing that's going to
[20:52] put you in that sixth Dimension was
[20:55] perfect love which is the Born Again
[20:56] experience see these people people right
[20:58] here receive not the
[21:01] love of the truth not just the truth
[21:04] they receive the truth cuz they got to
[21:06] believe a lie be down by it we want to
[21:08] read this in just a
[21:09] minute they receive not the love of the
[21:13] truth that they might be
[21:16] saved and for this cause God shall send
[21:19] them strong
[21:22] delusion that they should believe a lie
[21:26] that they all might be damned who
[21:27] believe
[21:28] not the truth but had pleasure and
[21:32] unrighteousness see there's the first
[21:34] seal opening now what is got most people
[21:38] there's there's one thing that I'm going
[21:42] to find that scripture and I haven't
[21:43] found it yet but I was looking through
[21:45] it the other day remember I talking
[21:46] about the Holy One of Israel what does
[21:49] everybody believe except the really that
[21:51] knows the Bible that knows you know
[21:54] believes what the message of the hour
[21:56] we're the only people that have a true
[21:57] revelation of one
[21:59] God how he came how he did what he did
[22:02] how he wasn't three persons how he
[22:04] wasn't you know three Spirits how he
[22:06] wasn't three
[22:08] individuals that's what a trinity is I
[22:10] don't care how they say it they're
[22:12] saying three distinct individual persons
[22:14] so they're saying there's three Gods but
[22:16] the Bible says the Holy One of Israel
[22:19] and it's in capital letters one one
[22:20] means one he didn't say the holy two or
[22:22] the holy three or the holy third person
[22:24] or the second person right he said the
[22:26] Holy One of Israel
[22:29] so in our
[22:31] studies let's go to
[22:35] Matthew I told you to keep a marker in
[22:39] Matthew
[22:41] 24 I took mine out when I was at bur so
[22:44] I got to finally again myself
[22:48] 24 we just read second Thessalonians
[22:51] right what did we say there would be
[22:54] there would come a man of
[22:56] sin that would dece deceive the
[22:59] people and make them believe a lie or
[23:03] believe this message with a little twist
[23:06] and be down
[23:08] by let's just be truthful people if if
[23:12] if if Satan
[23:15] has the denominations have a trinitarian
[23:18] idea the denominations have father son
[23:20] Holy Ghost baptism Satan's already got
[23:22] those
[23:23] people so where's he after he after the
[23:27] ones with be through
[23:28] that have the love of the truth but it's
[23:31] the ones that was always the mix
[23:32] multitude that have the problem verse
[23:35] five Matthew
[23:36] 24:5 for many shall come in my name what
[23:39] did we just talk about man of sin
[23:40] showing himself that he is God not
[23:43] wanting to be not like to be but he's
[23:45] showing himself that he is God for many
[23:47] shall come in my name saying I am
[23:50] Christ and shall
[23:53] deceive many just same thing in second
[23:56] Thessalonians
[23:59] now let's go to verse 23 let's go to
[24:05] 22 and said those days should be
[24:07] shortened there shall be no flesh there
[24:10] should no flesh be say
[24:13] flesh didn't say
[24:15] Spirit didn't say flesh so we're dealing
[24:19] with the flesh right right s seals were
[24:22] given for the Redemption of the body not
[24:24] for the soul Paul's Soul was redeemed
[24:26] without knowing a thing about the seal
[24:29] irenius is soul brother randam Soul was
[24:31] redeemed Eternal before the seals ever
[24:34] open but the opening of those seals are
[24:37] for the Redemption of your body all
[24:41] right so that's where we got to tie it
[24:42] in and we will do so if God permit but
[24:47] for the elect sake those days shall be
[24:49] shorten you know when the uh earthquake
[24:51] happened in Japan you know what happened
[24:53] right the days got
[24:55] shorter the Earth's access actually went
[24:58] so many degrees back up God's not
[25:00] throwing this thing out of cater he's
[25:02] trying to get it back in cater right
[25:04] okay day shorten by so many milliseconds
[25:07] I you know us older people like like the
[25:09] ones that are getting close to 50 or
[25:13] over um oh sister Vanessa had a birthday
[25:16] yesterday happy birthday
[25:20] s but though I mean that means something
[25:23] but look at the scripture the scripture
[25:24] says for the elect's sake that's mean in
[25:27] you for our sake these things are
[25:29] happening for our sake God is shortened
[25:32] even by a
[25:33] millisecond God knows we need it I need
[25:36] it myself a millisecond is okay for
[25:39] me but what is he doing that earthquake
[25:42] took that whole ball called the Earth
[25:44] this huge thing we live on and tilted it
[25:46] back up so it's going back remember
[25:47] we're going back to an even condition
[25:49] where the where the where the poles are
[25:51] straight up and down not so many degrees
[25:53] off we're not going to wobble anymore we
[25:56] wobbled as Christians down here long
[25:58] enough in this flesh for the elate those
[26:01] days shall be
[26:02] shortened
[26:06] then this day the scripture fulfilled
[26:09] then then if any man shall say unto you
[26:14] L I got the revelation of the
[26:18] message and they
[26:21] don't are there low here see low here is
[26:25] Christ L we got we got to go over to
[26:28] brother so and so we got to go over to
[26:30] this we got
[26:31] to okay you understand what I'm saying
[26:34] Lo here is Christ are there whoa the
[26:37] Bible
[26:38] says oh believe it just go for no it
[26:41] says believe it
[26:45] not now listen people the only way
[26:48] you're not going to be deceived by that
[26:51] is to know that Christ is right here
[26:53] that's right why do I have to go get
[26:55] Christ when I got him right here why do
[26:58] I have to go even it even says like over
[27:00] the sea and over here and over there you
[27:02] understand then if any man shall say
[27:04] unto you Lo here is Christ or there
[27:08] believe it
[27:10] not for there shall arise false Christ
[27:14] brother R said that was false Christ not
[27:16] not not demons false Christ Capital CH r
[27:21] i s and false prophets and shall show
[27:24] show Great Signs and wonder in so much
[27:26] that it if it were possible they should
[27:29] deceive the very leg behold I have told
[27:31] you before you remember what brother
[27:33] Dell always tells us if God repeats
[27:35] himself in the Bible you better listen
[27:37] cuz God don't repeat itself but right
[27:40] here it repeats itself in other words
[27:41] it's telling you a little different
[27:42] angle behold I have told you before this
[27:45] is Jesus
[27:46] speaking wherefore if they see Jesus is
[27:50] speaking
[27:51] this they what that rider that's going
[27:55] out they that power that were given that
[27:59] horse they that other person they shall
[28:02] say unto you the
[28:06] elect behold he is in the desert go not
[28:10] for behold he's in the secret chamber
[28:13] well that sounds good the Bible says for
[28:16] us to go into the secret chamber and
[28:18] pray what did Jesus say believe it not
[28:22] and I wrote in my Bible because he is in
[28:25] the
[28:26] bride and that's the only place Christ
[28:28] is I'm
[28:30] sorry that's just the way it is I didn't
[28:32] write the Bible but God is only going to
[28:35] take care of his own children he is not
[28:37] going to take care of the devil's
[28:39] children I love all your children but
[28:42] mine comes first sorry cuz they're my
[28:44] flesh and blood and God's going to take
[28:46] care of his kids first cuz they're we're
[28:48] his bone of his bone remember bone of
[28:51] his bone bless of his flesh remember
[28:53] what we said here sister Vanessa this is
[28:55] our kind of our theme you know when a
[29:00] minute that's what job
[29:03] said in my flesh I shall see God in the
[29:06] end time in other words those skin worms
[29:08] destroy my body and we lay brother Tom
[29:10] to rest you know we I'm going to read
[29:12] the scripture about that just a second
[29:13] want to do it in his honor here's what
[29:16] an end time bride says right
[29:18] here I am My Flesh I shall see God
[29:21] without
[29:22] dying that's a promise somebody's going
[29:25] to do that sir thank
[29:29] you she said right
[29:32] there so that's what we're talking about
[29:36] because in my flesh I'm going to see God
[29:38] whether I go by the grave didn't matter
[29:41] we go by the grave in his flesh when we
[29:43] Clos that casket the other day you'll
[29:46] never see that man because that man was
[29:48] born in sin that part we saw was from a
[29:52] mom and daddy that flesh won't inherit
[29:54] the kingdom of God right but he's going
[29:57] to change that flesh because I this is
[29:59] what I believe there's going to be empty
[30:01] tomb cuz Jesus's tomb was empty his body
[30:04] wasn't laying in there and he was
[30:05] walking around all over the Earth push's
[30:08] body is going to come up out of that
[30:09] grave not pushing a bunch of dirt out
[30:12] remember this is secret secret going
[30:15] away and when that body comes up he's
[30:18] going to be changed in that picture that
[30:20] we saw of him being 20 years
[30:22] old so let's but let's read what let's
[30:25] read what we had to do
[30:28] let's turn over
[30:30] to I'll have to find it I was going to
[30:33] write it down and I didn't the other
[30:36] day hang on me I'll find it I got it
[30:39] wrote right on top of my
[30:44] Bible it's in the
[30:47] Corinthians all right turn to First
[30:56] Corinthians
[30:59] this is this has nothing to do with what
[31:01] we're talking about but it has
[31:02] everything to do with what we're talking
[31:04] about CU if the seventh seal is revealed
[31:07] brother r that brings God back to the
[31:09] Earth and God back to the Earth is in
[31:10] human flesh mine and yours all right
[31:14] let's read this in honor brother
[31:18] Tom and let's understand why we had to
[31:20] do what we
[31:22] did right 1 Corinthians
[31:25] 15 verse
[31:27] 39 this is in honor of no let's go with
[31:31] verse 35 this is honor of brother Tom
[31:32] just for a few
[31:34] minutes he's a very dear very dear
[31:36] brother very dear friend of
[31:40] our but we won't see that man that
[31:42] walked Among Us will not see that man
[31:45] again we will not see that old Decay
[31:48] bent
[31:49] over um body ever again and this is why
[31:54] right
[31:55] here but some man will say how are the
[31:58] dead raised
[32:01] up and with what body do they come sorry
[32:09] 15:35 now y'all think I'm a little rough
[32:12] read that next verse 36 Paul said thou
[32:18] fool
[32:20] boy sometimes when we don't understand
[32:22] stuff we want people to go well that's
[32:23] okay brother that's you just understand
[32:25] what you can understand that fool
[32:29] Jesus said fools and SL
[32:32] heart hypocrite snake in the grass Jesus
[32:36] was uh pretty
[32:38] plain thou
[32:40] fool that which thou
[32:42] sest is not quickened except it
[32:47] die and that which thou
[32:51] sest thou sest not that body that shall
[32:56] be
[33:00] what did God do in the garden he didn't
[33:02] curse Adam and Eve he cursed what the
[33:05] ground the
[33:07] Earth right he cursed the Earth he
[33:10] cursed that crust what is this right
[33:12] here this is our Earth I want to preach
[33:15] on this one day cuz the Earth has a
[33:17] outer core I mean an outer crust an
[33:19] inner core and a center we're Body
[33:23] Spirit don't right this part was cursed
[33:26] right
[33:27] right you can't see this on here that's
[33:28] okay but this part was cursed right now
[33:32] what we had to do is we had to get Tom
[33:34] back into
[33:37] here so it can come back
[33:40] here
[33:43] what I was hoping somebody would have
[33:45] read that that's
[33:46] okay and that which thou sest H thou
[33:52] humans thou sest not that body that
[33:55] shall be
[33:57] but bear grain it may chance of wheat or
[34:00] of some other grain but God giveth it a
[34:03] body as it hath pleased him and to every
[34:05] seed his own body All Flesh is not the
[34:10] same flesh but there is one kind of
[34:13] Flesh of men another of Beast another
[34:15] fish another of
[34:16] birds there are also celestial bodies
[34:20] and bodies terrestrial but the glory of
[34:23] the celestial is
[34:24] one say Amen to that
[34:27] and the glory of the terrestrial is
[34:29] another when you say Amen to that that's
[34:31] the one that likes the football games
[34:32] and all that stuff there's one glory of
[34:34] the sun another glory of the Moon
[34:36] another glory of the stars for one star
[34:38] differ from another star in glory now
[34:41] here's his
[34:42] answer the question was how are the dead
[34:45] raised and with what body do they come
[34:47] verse
[34:48] 42 so also is the resurrection of the
[34:53] Dead it was
[34:55] sown made we change that to just a
[34:58] little bit because sewn and the word
[35:00] planted mean the
[35:02] same what do you do when you plow a
[35:05] garden you you sew the seed into the
[35:08] garden right you put it into the Earth
[35:11] and you cover it up
[35:15] right it is sown in
[35:20] corruption that's what we did to brother
[35:22] Tom we we committed his body we sowed
[35:25] him into the ground
[35:27] in corruption in not not not in
[35:30] corruption but
[35:32] in space corruption cuz that's what went
[35:35] down but here's the wonderful
[35:39] part
[35:40] it the same thing we
[35:44] sowed cuz it was cursed and had to go
[35:47] back into that crust of the ground
[35:51] right it it the same body is raised in
[35:56] in corruption there's when he's going to
[35:59] come out of the ground his body's going
[36:00] to be changed sin's going to be over for
[36:03] you and I that's why we have to do we
[36:05] have to plant everybody back into the
[36:09] ground there's only one group of people
[36:11] that's going to make it it's not going
[36:13] to have to be swn they're going to have
[36:15] to destroy death while we're standing on
[36:17] the top of this ground you say how can
[36:19] that happen Jesus Christ did it when he
[36:21] came on
[36:23] earth when he come up out of the Grave
[36:25] he said you don't have to do this
[36:26] anymore
[36:27] we just got to understand back to my
[36:29] statement Jesus said all power in heaven
[36:32] and earth been given unto me and where
[36:33] were you and
[36:34] I where were you and I when he spoke
[36:37] that word in
[36:40] him so if we're
[36:43] sown in Jesus Christ This is the part
[36:46] we're going to have to understand we
[36:47] keep leaning toward being swn from the
[36:49] parents that's swn in corruption that's
[36:51] why we have to put it down in the ground
[36:53] that's why we have to put it back
[36:54] because it's it's there's a curse on
[36:57] it has to go back down under the
[37:00] ground but the Bible gives us this cons
[37:03] consolation that we it will be raised in
[37:08] incorruption you will never see that
[37:10] corrupt body of K PA Bush ever again for
[37:13] eternity but you're sure going to see
[37:15] that man the real man yes man' something
[37:20] I often wondered how the gra how that
[37:22] body would be changed and be secr no gra
[37:25] open that body going get out Jesus went
[37:28] through the
[37:30] wall through the wall and that's
[37:33] right absolutely going to pick that body
[37:35] up and just what I believe I mean you
[37:37] know people say that you know say well
[37:39] we go out and we'll see the resurrection
[37:40] because the graves will be but why would
[37:42] they need to be busted open if we're in
[37:43] a glorified
[37:46] condition that's what people always say
[37:48] brother R got to come back get an
[37:49] airplane if he comes back he ain't going
[37:50] to need an
[37:52] airplane he ain't going to need an
[37:53] airplane
[37:55] people he going travel like a th
[37:57] airplane just slow him
[38:00] down that's
