[6:30] with me and being turned i saw seven
[6:32] golden candlesticks and in the midst of
[6:34] the seven candlesticks one like unto the
[6:36] son of man clothed with a garment down
[6:39] to the foot and gird about the paps with

[6:43] girdle now then let's turn over because
[6:45] we still ain't got to that to praying

[6:52] about
[6:52] all right we want to go to second peter

[7:00] 4. simon peter a servant an apostle of
[7:03] jesus christ to them that have obtained
[7:05] like precious faith with us through the
[7:08] righteousness of god our savior
[7:10] jesus christ

[7:17] like precious faith
[7:19] grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[7:21] through the knowledge of god and of
[7:23] jesus our lord according that his divine
[7:26] power hath given unto us all things that
[7:29] pertain unto life and godliness
[7:32] through the knowledge
[7:33] the knowledge of him that have called us
[7:36] glory and virtue
[7:38] whereby given to us exceeding great and
[7:41] precious promises that by these you
[7:44] might be partakers
[7:45] of the divine nature haven't escaped the
[7:48] corruption that is in the world through
[7:51] lust you may be seated lord that is
[7:54] blessing to the
[7:56] reading of the word
[7:59] now we tried to bring out this morning
[8:03] and
[8:04] thinking on the things
[8:06] that we've considered for a while and
[8:09] speaking about
[8:11] the uh
[8:13] god condescending and
[8:15] revealing himself and
[8:17] coming down and making himself manifest
[8:19] among us
[8:21] and doing all the way through
[8:23] and watching him unfold himself
[8:26] as he condescends
[8:28] down to you and i to word that we can
[8:32] understand
[8:34] right
[8:35] to not back up too far but to think
[8:37] about
[8:38] the things we were trying to cover this
[8:40] morning
[8:42] of how that
[8:44] we saw that
[8:47] the christ
[8:49] when peter said thou art the christ
[8:52] the son of the living god or the christ
[8:54] of god
[8:56] that he was signifying to show that he
[8:58] was the creator god
[9:01] and that would fulfill hebrews 1 john 1.
[9:05] and read those scriptures where it says
[9:06] you know about all things were created
[9:08] by him and without him was not anything
[9:10] made that was made
[9:11] all right
[9:12] and seeing it on down to giant to
[9:15] ephesians
[9:16] uh three and nine where he created all
[9:19] things
[9:20] by jesus christ and jesus christ is the
[9:23] word
[9:24] all right you say well there it says
[9:25] jesus
[9:27] but jesus was not the creator the human
[9:29] flesh that we call jesus
[9:32] just remember jesus is the only name of
[9:34] god all right so jesus christ is correct
[9:40] if you were just saying jesus the flesh
[9:41] you're incorrect
[9:44] but jesus christ was almighty god
[9:47] because that was his name
[9:49] and the only name that he ever had see
[9:51] was jesus christ was jesus all right
[9:55] and we went through trying to show how
[9:56] that in the old testament
[9:59] that we followed the christ
[10:01] and looking at it and seeing that that
[10:03] christ was the anointing
[10:06] or the anointed
[10:08] and that it appeared in many ways like
[10:10] through david
[10:12] and joshua sampson
[10:15] moses all of those prophets
[10:19] were christ's for the time now not
[10:22] themselves
[10:23] but the word they were bringing me
[10:26] okay all right they themselves could be
[10:29] anointed of that spirit right all right
[10:32] and and coming forth and and you know
[10:34] and doing it but we saw that he was the
[10:37] angel of the covenant
[10:39] and you'll read in the book of acts that
[10:41] it speaks of jesus christ being the
[10:43] angel of the covenant all right the one
[10:46] who spoke to moses from the burning bush
[10:49] you know all right who was that back
[10:52] there the christ
[10:53] who was it throughout the bible the
[10:55] christ
[10:56] the anointing
[10:58] all right
[10:59] to make manifest and show god as he
[11:02] would be coming down
[11:04] to
[11:05] you and i
[11:07] that it would be bringing forth the
[11:09] christ
[11:10] the anointing all right coming down then
[11:14] to the last days coming through the
[11:17] the uh time of the new testament parts
[11:20] you know and peter recognizing him and
[11:23] then coming to to uh the day of
[11:26] pentecost and the holy ghost coming and
[11:29] the descending and holy spirit down
[11:31] through the ages bringing it down to the
[11:35] age that we're living in
[11:37] and to see that brother branham said it
[11:39] like this he said one day that that
[11:41] anointing that came on him on the river
[11:43] jordan left him in the garden of
[11:45] gethsemane
[11:46] all right
[11:47] and then later on he declared it this
[11:49] way he said is to return upon the bride
[11:52] of jesus christ
[11:53] in the last days all right
[11:56] now that would be making her the
[11:58] anointed
[12:00] you know
[12:02] making her to be the messiahs
[12:05] making her to be the fulfilling of the
[12:06] word
[12:08] and bringing us down to the hour that
[12:11] we're living like brother branham said
[12:13] on christ's mystery he was so you know
[12:16] it amazes me sometimes to think about
[12:20] how the man can know so much but yet he
[12:23] can just pull it right up and just stop
[12:27] and you say well he ought to finish that
[12:30] you know
[12:31] and he gets on christ's mystery we'll
[12:32] get a chance we'll read it in a minute
[12:34] where he said it's unfolded itself down
[12:36] to this present hour
[12:39] that we're living
[12:41] well you know why
[12:43] i believe he meant that
[12:45] he doesn't fold it down to that point
[12:46] but he knew it wasn't through unfolding
[12:49] right amen
[12:51] but he knew the next day wasn't unfolded
[12:54] he had to wait until that time for it to
[12:56] be revealed all right so beautiful in
[12:58] the writing that the ways that he would
[13:00] say things when you go back and you
[13:02] check the scriptures and see how that
[13:05] that come forth you know in the writings
[13:08] and in the understanding all right
[13:11] but now see then we've seen that it come
[13:14] down to its rest in christ
[13:18] there as he was upon the earth you know
[13:20] the lord jesus christ
[13:22] and then as i said promised to come back
[13:24] in the last days to be poured out
[13:27] see to fulfill the scriptures where it
[13:30] said that i'll pour out my spirit upon
[13:32] all flesh you know which would be poured
[13:35] out in the end time
[13:37] to be then to where you could see the
[13:40] anointing or the anointed
[13:44] all right
[13:45] now
[13:46] that is a wonderful thing but just
[13:48] remember now and i didn't give these for
[13:51] brother anderson to
[13:52] to uh give because he's got so much on
[13:54] him right now
[13:56] to try to keep up with us
[13:58] but
[14:00] the
[14:01] we think well all we need is the
[14:03] anointing
[14:06] all right
[14:07] see then
[14:08] he gets into the message and he says it
[14:10] this way
[14:11] on the anointed ones at the end time
[14:13] paragraph 127
[14:16] now people can live in this spirit they
[14:18] can dance in the spirit they shout in
[14:20] the spirit they go to church in the
[14:22] spirit they can absolutely have the real
[14:25] spirit of god
[14:27] anointed on that spirit
[14:31] but still be lost and just as devil
[14:34] possessed as they can be with that
[14:36] spirit
[14:39] all right so we come down to anointed
[14:41] ones and he goes on to tell us because
[14:43] this is where he's bringing it that you
[14:45] can't tell that woman that it's wrong to
[14:47] cut her hair and wear her pants and the
[14:49] things like that you can't tell her why
[14:52] because she's anointed
[14:55] all right you remember the other day and
[14:56] i was bringing it out so you can't tell
[14:58] people if they're anointed you take
[15:00] somebody that deals with anointing
[15:04] all right and i'm a firm believer in it
[15:07] i've i've tried my best to explain to
[15:09] you what i believe in the anointings and
[15:11] and how i've smelt the presence of the
[15:13] lord how i've seen things and and seen
[15:16] different things in my home i believe in
[15:19] the anointing i believe in the
[15:20] supernatural
[15:23] but yet you can be tied up into the
[15:24] point that if something speaks to you
[15:28] then you can start going with that and
[15:30] keep following it
[15:32] but remember it doesn't matter about the
[15:34] anointing
[15:35] it's what the word says
[15:38] all right
[15:39] the anointing can be great and wonderful
[15:41] and we appreciate it
[15:42] but you just can't tell people that are
[15:44] anointed things because
[15:46] you know
[15:47] they're not going to listen to you
[15:49] because they spent all of their life
[15:51] under what they think
[15:54] is the holy spirit and it may be
[15:57] because that's what he's just saying
[16:02] you say would god do that
[16:05] yes
[16:08] he allows it to take place
[16:11] to try you and i
[16:12] to see what we'll do
[16:15] all right look what he says on a
[16:17] thinking man's filter
[16:20] he said you see that anointing
[16:22] upon the spirit
[16:25] not upon the soul
[16:29] that anointing upon the spirit
[16:32] not upon the soul
[16:34] all right
[16:38] on a message called paradox
[16:42] he said
[16:45] we all know the anointing of is christ
[16:48] that comes upon the word
[16:50] to make the word live
[16:52] is that right
[16:54] amen christ is the anointing the spirit
[16:57] that comes upon the word that quickens
[16:59] the word to make it live
[17:01] now the word is in your heart you
[17:03] believe in divine healing and so what
[17:05] the words are see waiting for the holy
[17:08] spirit and that's word that i believe
[17:10] when i do about the new birth
[17:14] i believe you take the word but it must
[17:16] be then revealed to you
[17:18] to make a new birth
[17:21] all right it's not just something that
[17:23] you believe it you talk about it you
[17:26] think it you say i've got it
[17:28] it's when it's revealed it becomes the
[17:30] new birth all right and doing that then
[17:33] it's not just an anointing upon your
[17:35] spirit
[17:38] it is the opening of the word into your
[17:41] heart
[17:42] that gives you the new birth
[17:44] all right then that way you're a child
[17:46] of god
[17:47] you're not just a church member or an
[17:49] anointing or anything
[17:51] but you can have that baptism of the
[17:53] holy ghost
[17:55] every day of your life and miss it
[17:57] right you said brother brother dale i
[17:59] thought we had to have the baptism on
[18:01] your spirit
[18:03] it can just be upon your spirit part of
[18:05] you
[18:06] and not upon bringing it to the soul
[18:10] all right
[18:10] you see why then that what i was
[18:12] bringing this morning and i believe it i
[18:15] believe in the anointing i believe in
[18:17] the genuine anointing on the genuine
[18:21] right
[18:24] i believe in that because that's what it
[18:26] is it is the anointing
[18:29] but remember too you can be anointed
[18:32] with a genuine holy spirit he said
[18:34] balaam was anointed
[18:37] with the same spirit that moses was
[18:42] so how do you tell the difference
[18:44] balaam was off the word
[18:46] right
[18:47] but you better remember one thing too he
[18:49] wasn't off the word until he faced
[18:51] the prophet right amen
[18:54] because there was nobody to judge him
[18:58] see
[18:59] that's where it's so strong church the
[19:02] anointing
[19:04] until maybe we need to just spend days
[19:06] months weeks years preaching on that to
[19:09] get it to the point that we can
[19:10] understand
[19:13] but the hardest parts is to get people
[19:15] not to fall off one side or the other
[19:19] you see you don't believe i preached one
[19:21] day on the manifestation of the spirit
[19:23] of god a certain brother went home with
[19:25] me that day first thing he said you
[19:28] don't believe in the manifestation do
[19:30] you
[19:33] i mean i just
[19:36] i said i spent an hour and a half
[19:39] explaining why i believed it
[19:41] but you don't believe it
[19:43] that's all he got out of the whole
[19:45] message
[19:46] and me explaining what i believe because
[19:48] i was explaining i believe correctly
[19:51] just like the anointing you can take
[19:53] that and you can just go with it or you
[19:55] can go but what is it
[19:59] it could be the genuine anointing upon
[20:01] your spirit
[20:06] and not quicken the word in your soul
[20:09] because i got one in here somewhere
[20:10] where he's talking about
[20:11] let's see it won't quicken
[20:15] a denominational seed
[20:18] the holy ghost can't quicken the trinity
[20:20] there's no such thing in the bible
[20:23] the lord revealed to me there was a
[20:24] trinity
[20:26] now lord never revealed to you there's
[20:27] no trinity
[20:29] i don't care what you say that's right
[20:32] because there's no trinity and god
[20:34] doesn't do it that way but he permits it
[20:37] by allowing the anointing to come upon
[20:39] us to think that we are genuine
[20:44] well i just don't know how to tell the
[20:45] difference
[20:46] go back to the word
[20:50] right
[20:53] back to the word well everybody else
[20:56] says they go back to the word
[21:00] okay
[21:02] okay go ahead
[21:05] we'll find somebody that's on the word
[21:08] and let them come and face it
[21:11] right
[21:13] you're gonna find out a lot of
[21:14] difference then
[21:15] well that's just your way of seeing it
[21:17] you're just argumenting i agree i'm
[21:19] argumented
[21:21] i agree i'm hateful i'm american
[21:25] i'm an old dude i agree with every bit
[21:28] of it
[21:30] but what about the word
[21:33] right
[21:34] what about the word
[21:36] all right so we can watch the anointing
[21:39] and we can talk about the anointing
[21:42] and talk about it correctly and bringing
[21:44] it down because firmly believing in the
[21:47] anointing
[21:50] all right
[21:52] but to believe it you've got to be born
[21:54] again amen
[21:56] and that's not just an anointing
[22:00] now
[22:01] remember what i've always taught you
[22:04] the people of the old testament weren't
[22:05] born again that's right
[22:12] none born greater than john right
[22:15] a prophet right an introducer of christ
[22:18] right right but the least in the kingdom
[22:20] is greater than he
[22:22] is that bible
[22:24] all right
[22:27] so the main thing the prophet said is
[22:29] whether you have that
[22:31] baptism of the holy ghost and your birth
[22:35] you can have it on your spirit and be
[22:36] baptized every day with it still not not
[22:38] be right
[22:40] but if you're born again
[22:43] all right
[22:44] if you're born again
[22:47] it is the same anointing that burst you
[22:51] the difference is is if you just
[22:53] understand the coming down of the holy
[22:54] spirit that the holy spirit comes down
[22:56] upon your spirit
[22:59] all right now watch what i'm saying
[23:01] it comes down upon your spirit
[23:04] it quickens what's in your soul
[23:07] but if there's no word in that soul it
[23:09] can't quicken
[23:11] why was it that jesus was seen of over
[23:14] 500 brethren
[23:17] the bible says and calls them brethren
[23:21] but there was only 120 made it to the
[23:23] upper room
[23:25] for some reason the others didn't get
[23:27] there
[23:28] well it was just too busy yeah well
[23:30] that's probably about right they're just
[23:32] too busy
[23:34] what's busy got to do with a new birth
[23:35] or not
[23:37] but do you understand so we can move on
[23:40] that we can follow the christ and
[23:42] brother brown said if you can't see
[23:44] christ in every verse
[23:47] go back and read it again
[23:49] because you've missed something
[23:51] all right
[23:53] it's wonderful to study other things and
[23:55] to see the holy spirit come upon those
[23:58] people and the things that they've done
[24:00] back there he's then one day was the
[24:02] other day was listening he said make us
[24:04] ashamed
[24:07] of ourselves about the things that they
[24:10] done
[24:11] under that old testament form
[24:16] right
[24:20] but see it's not just the anointing
[24:24] all right
[24:26] now this is about four months
[24:29] maybe
[24:30] longer that i've had these notes
[24:34] my wife won't throw nothing away because
[24:36] she she's afraid i might have something
[24:38] i need she told me yesterday said your
[24:40] office isn't a mess
[24:43] because i've got quotes run off for you
[24:46] know probably 100 or 150 pages of quotes
[24:50] run off
[24:51] on the things that i'm relating to and i
[24:54] just lay them over
[24:56] and then when i get ready to use them
[24:58] i'll write on the top of them what they
[25:00] are and put a paper clip to hold most of
[25:02] them together
[25:03] and it might be three months before i
[25:05] ever get back to that
[25:08] but i do have them laying there to where
[25:10] i can
[25:11] pick them up and about three or four
[25:13] months ago i began to think on a on a
[25:16] little subject and things and
[25:18] and i started to try to bring it out
[25:22] and i've seen immediately that that i
[25:23] needed to
[25:25] uh make sure and lay a foundational
[25:27] point to where we could so we brought it
[25:30] all the way down through and i hope now
[25:32] it's getting clear to you
[25:34] about what happened to eve in the garden
[25:38] and how that it was in her spirit
[25:40] that things got messed up
[25:43] it was not in her body until her spirit
[25:46] accepted those thoughts and ideas
[25:49] and she began to reason upon them then
[25:51] the effects went into the flesh part
[25:55] all right and that's the same as it is
[25:57] today
[25:59] and the same that you see in the message
[26:01] of the hour
[26:03] you see
[26:04] the
[26:04] people
[26:06] are just flocking to the anointing
[26:10] you let somebody have a little emotional
[26:13] up doings
[26:15] in their preaching and the people just
[26:17] flock to it
[26:19] but you also see them run with them
[26:21] three or four months and then you see
[26:23] them leave and flock somewhere else
[26:27] because that's where they build out
[26:29] they're built on that emotional thing
[26:32] i want you and i'm not throwing off on
[26:34] you because we're human i watch you when
[26:36] somebody comes through that's emotional
[26:38] you're more emotional with them than you
[26:39] are with me well that don't make me mad
[26:42] i know what you're doing
[26:45] i just said come on buddy come on get in
[26:48] the right channel to where we can all
[26:50] rejoice together because i like it too
[26:53] all right
[26:54] but then when you've got to have the
[26:56] emotion of the anointing before you can
[26:59] believe the word
[27:00] then you're right in the devil's trap
[27:02] because that's where eve was at
[27:04] all right but seeing what happened in
[27:07] the garden with her
[27:10] look where it took away any opportunity
[27:13] of the holy spirit to be able to come in
[27:16] a new birth
[27:19] it took away the opportunity of being
[27:22] able to fulfill god's plan and purpose
[27:26] and it would take him 2 000 years
[27:31] really for 4 000 years
[27:34] that it would take god
[27:36] in building the things
[27:38] to bring it to the place that it could
[27:40] come forth to be able to make some
[27:43] opportunity
[27:44] for the soul of mankind to be saved
[27:48] but yet he wasn't just playing around
[27:51] go to masterpiece and study it
[27:54] abraham isaac jacob joseph foundation
[27:59] body built by the prophets
[28:02] right
[28:04] take out one of them
[28:06] are missing
[28:08] right
[28:10] body built by the prophets
[28:12] the neck being john
[28:14] to come to introduce the head which was
[28:17] christ
[28:19] all right
[28:21] see then in that
[28:23] we can see god was doing something
[28:25] under the time of the
[28:28] anointing but just remember
[28:32] he said it himself
[28:34] he said that he would allow these things
[28:36] to come among us
[28:39] they did to them
[28:42] he allowed things to happen
[28:44] under anointing balaam was anointed just
[28:47] like
[28:48] moses was anointed or elijah was
[28:50] anointed
[28:51] and you couldn't tell the difference
[28:52] because he was no difference in the
[28:54] anointing and balaam remember is that my
[28:56] right now balaam he even prophesied some
[28:59] things that would take place under the
[29:01] as i said this morning caiaphas
[29:04] prophesied that it was necessary that
[29:06] one died for the sins of the people
[29:08] under the anointing of the holy spirit
[29:11] that was anointing their spirit
[29:16] but then we think the new birth is just
[29:18] some anointing
[29:20] shouting crying speaking in tongues
[29:24] oh wonderful that's right
[29:27] but none of that is the birth
[29:30] four thousand years and he could not
[29:31] bring one birth
[29:38] do you understand what that means
[29:41] that for 4 000 years under the anointing
[29:44] that god could not one bring one new
[29:46] birth to anybody
[29:49] that's right
[29:51] in john
[29:52] the baptist coming to be a prophet as he
[29:55] was receiving the holy ghost in his
[29:57] mother's womb
[29:59] but yet he was not a born-again
[30:01] christian right
[30:04] you say but now wait a minute okay then
[30:07] why don't you go read a little bit and
[30:08] find out in the bible that elizabeth was
[30:10] filled with the holy spirit yeah
[30:14] you didn't ever read that
[30:16] see we're there with john and i believe
[30:18] it
[30:19] but remember we need to read a lot more
[30:21] because elizabeth said was
[30:24] full of the holy spirit
[30:26] all right
[30:28] but you see then it would take the death
[30:32] of the lord jesus christ
[30:35] to bring it to a position
[30:37] that you could
[30:40] have a new birth amen
[30:43] all right
[30:44] now
[30:45] then the
[30:46] prophecies
[30:48] of the old testament
[30:52] so you think about it i'm thinking
[30:53] another day about it we're trying to
[30:55] express something to you about paul and
[30:57] and see when that light struck him down
[30:59] and and and here he goes out there
[31:02] and here sets paul
[31:04] paul knew isaiah
[31:08] and how a virgin would conceive he knew
[31:10] those scriptures
[31:12] he knew how the lawgiver would come
[31:14] before between the knees of judah
[31:18] he knew those scriptures
[31:20] but they never struck him until
[31:23] the holy spirit gave him a new birth
[31:27] and then he could even though
[31:30] i believe he was born to prophet don't
[31:32] you because i believe paul was a prophet
[31:35] now of course the people of the messiah
[31:36] argue with you on half that's all right
[31:38] they said paul was no prophet
[31:40] well brother branham even called luther
[31:42] and wesley and all he called him
[31:44] prophets because it was who the word
[31:46] come to
[31:47] is what you're dealing with a prophet
[31:49] all right
[31:50] and then paul would be greater than
[31:52] agabus
[31:54] which it says he was a prophet
[31:56] okay
[31:57] but not to argue with no one just to
[31:59] make the point and go on
[32:01] that that great apostle paul
[32:04] see then he could take the scrolls and
[32:07] the holy spirit could come off of the
[32:09] pages
[32:11] into that man's
[32:13] thinking
[32:14] and show him the christ
[32:16] that was throughout the word
[32:21] show him the things we talked of this
[32:22] morning
[32:24] show him the anoint the anointings and
[32:26] the things
[32:29] and do it in the correct order to have
[32:31] everything lined up
[32:35] but he also knew that there was
[32:37] something else
[32:41] see that's basically what man speaks of
[32:43] today even in the message
[32:46] is the anointing
[32:50] some of you that listen to these other
[32:51] brothers and you're thinking
[32:53] how many of us preaching on a new birth
[32:57] to tell you anything about the new birth
[32:59] no it's this great thing that we've got
[33:01] this message we we've got we've been you
[33:04] know we're these people we're oh it's
[33:06] all great
[33:09] but where's the new birth
[33:12] then where's the statue of prayer well
[33:14] that's way back in early part of this
[33:15] ministry we'll need that now
[33:20] we don't
[33:23] i still love to think about water
[33:25] baptism
[33:26] that was 50 years ago
[33:31] how long have you been since you got
[33:33] baptized
[33:34] that's a long time ago i still like to
[33:36] think of that and still love to do them
[33:38] you know
[33:40] because that's that's just part of me
[33:42] all right
[33:44] but think about it see that you can
[33:46] follow
[33:47] now let me get off the message now and
[33:48] get into what we need
[33:51] can follow the christ throughout the
[33:53] word
[33:59] but let me say it in the heart of love
[34:01] and
[34:03] the best grace i can have
[34:06] the denominational world can preach
[34:08] about the christ
[34:11] they might not know what brother branham
[34:12] did about the anointed ones and how it
[34:14] be the genuine anointing upon
[34:18] the
[34:18] balaam and the things but they know
[34:20] about the christ
[34:23] they know about things that happen back
[34:26] there
[34:27] but there's something that they don't
[34:29] know
[34:30] right
[34:31] and i wonder do we know it that's right
[34:39] i'm talking about lula ain't talking
[34:40] about somewhere else
[34:42] i'm talking to me and you ain't to
[34:43] somebody else that's for business
[34:46] to follow the christ
[34:49] the anointing throughout the word is
[34:51] wonderful
[34:53] but it does not complete
[34:56] the plan of god
[35:02] and to know all about the anointing
[35:05] we could be maybe no more than
[35:07] denominationalism
[35:09] who knows about the christ
[35:12] all right
[35:14] and i have to admit some of them do a
[35:16] better job of preaching
[35:18] the new birth than i hear of the
[35:19] pre-preachers in this message and that's
[35:22] as honest as i can be without being
[35:24] sarcastic
[35:25] because now it's just to believe brother
[35:27] brown was a prophet
[35:33] every day of your life
[35:36] die and go to hell right
[35:40] because they don't explain that it's on
[35:42] your spirit
[35:44] all right but think about it
[35:47] think about these things
[35:50] that
[35:51] we talk about
[35:57] let me give you just one more off the
[35:58] message called the rapture
[36:02] but remember it comes on oh glory i got
[36:04] the anointing
[36:05] and it's a genuine anointing remember
[36:08] caiaphas had it too and prophesied so
[36:10] did balaam have it and prophesied
[36:13] but that don't have nothing to do
[36:16] with this inside
[36:20] unless that was god's seed
[36:23] his gene from the beginning
[36:25] predestinated
[36:32] don't have nothing to do with the inside
[36:37] now if it was the spiritual realm that
[36:40] caused the fall
[36:42] and i hope by now at least you're
[36:44] beginning to believe a little bit about
[36:46] that
[36:48] that it was in eve the spiritual realm
[36:50] that caused the fall
[36:52] not the body not the soul
[36:55] but in that spiritual realm or spirit
[36:57] you know
[37:00] that she got all messed up and it
[37:01] created all of those things
[37:06] that it can't end with just the
[37:07] spiritual part
[37:11] it came in with just an anointing
[37:17] well brother dale i just want that
[37:18] anointing on me praise god
[37:24] praise god
[37:27] i've talked to you of my own personal
[37:29] experience of anointings until you can't
[37:32] say that i don't believe in them
[37:35] i smelt perfume it was so beautiful
[37:37] until
[37:38] marvelous down in the middle of the
[37:39] woods when there was nobody in that area
[37:41] at that time god was dealing with wade
[37:45] to get him to a place
[37:47] that i could speak to him
[37:50] and i failed and missed it
[37:55] until i seen what is going on
[37:59] i can talk to you about great
[38:01] experiences
[38:03] but that'll build you up on my
[38:05] experience
[38:08] and why tell you about it because i
[38:10] don't want you building on my experience
[38:12] i want you to build on your experience
[38:15] this member is your god and you not me
[38:17] and you and god
[38:18] because see the problem is if people
[38:20] think it's brother branham and them and
[38:21] god no no you've got to get away from
[38:24] that i don't care what we appreciate
[38:25] everything but it can't be that way
[38:28] brother is not our god
[38:30] you can't take the place
[38:33] i mean
[38:34] we honor we we give glory to all things
[38:37] because where would we be without the
[38:38] message we wouldn't know nothing
[38:41] but yet we put our honor upon the lord
[38:43] jesus christ
[38:45] all right
[38:47] now
[38:48] in doing that then let's think about
[38:50] something that was taking place
[38:54] throughout the bible
[38:57] throughout the old testament
[39:04] all right
[39:05] then on down into the new testament
[39:08] and right on down as it unfolds to the
[39:11] present hour
[39:13] that we're living
[39:15] and follow it through the word and i
[39:17] don't mean it to be something wrong as
[39:19] an it
[39:23] i just mean that god revealed something
[39:25] to me many many many years ago that i've
[39:27] tried to explain
[39:32] because i've never been one
[39:34] to put things upon emotional situations
[39:39] i've always been one to just go back to
[39:42] the word
[39:43] and and leave it there until god
[39:45] quickens it
[39:47] all right
[39:48] and bring it to that place but go ahead
[39:51] brother and pull up crisis of mr god
[39:53] reveal
[39:54] and let's read just a little bit then
[39:55] we'll get our thought
[39:57] and then
[39:58] move on to that if i don't finish this
[40:00] afternoon we will
[40:02] carry it on we instead worry about it
[40:06] but look what he says
[40:12] and god's great secret
[40:14] he had before the world began
[40:17] now back in the back part of god's mind
[40:20] there was something that he was trying
[40:22] and was going to achieve
[40:24] now the back part why would he emphasize
[40:27] the back part
[40:29] me
[40:31] are we having trouble with the michael
[40:33] yeah
[40:36] okay
[40:38] all right
[40:39] why would he emphasize the back part
[40:41] remember we've been through that
[40:44] that would go on back into the
[40:45] eternities word that brother branham
[40:47] would speak of in the beginning before
[40:49] the eternal
[40:51] and it would back up into his mind what
[40:53] about a prophet that can go back into
[40:55] the mind of god now that's something
[40:57] called you and i can't do it just forget
[40:59] it we go by him all right
[41:01] there was something that he was trying
[41:03] and was going to achieve
[41:06] he had a motive in doing it
[41:09] to just be the anointing to come upon
[41:11] him
[41:12] that's just part of it
[41:14] that's just part of the story
[41:18] right
[41:19] follow it now he had a motive in doing
[41:21] it in order to let himself be expressed
[41:24] because first there wasn't even a moon
[41:26] star atom molecule or anything he was
[41:28] god
[41:29] but he actually wasn't he actually
[41:32] wasn't god at that time because god is
[41:34] an object of worship and there was
[41:35] nothing to worship him so in his great
[41:37] mind he wanted these attributes to be
[41:39] displayed
[41:41] you know attributes to be expressed and
[41:43] in him was love in him which would be
[41:44] following him was to be son in him was
[41:46] to be savior and him was would be healer
[41:48] all of these attributes that we see
[41:49] already express
[41:51] they were in god
[41:53] all right
[41:54] so it's this not to anoint mankind
[42:01] it's not to just
[42:02] a fellowship form
[42:08] it's to see what's in his mind and what
[42:10] did he say
[42:11] he said so in my opinion the first thing
[42:13] he made was angels and then they
[42:14] worshipped and that made him god
[42:16] he started from there
[42:18] as the previous messages drop down a
[42:20] little bit paragraph 105. now god had a
[42:22] purpose and a hidden mystery that's what
[42:24] i want to speak on to the church this
[42:26] morning the hidden mystery of god that
[42:27] he had in his mind before the world ever
[42:29] began
[42:30] and how it's unfolded itself right down
[42:33] to this present hour that we're living
[42:35] see then you will understand clearly
[42:38] then you see on i believe what is being
[42:41] done
[42:42] god's great mystery of how it's a secret
[42:45] he kept it a secret nobody knows nothing
[42:47] about it even the angels didn't
[42:49] understand it
[42:51] he didn't reveal it that's the reason
[42:53] under our seventh mystery when the
[42:54] seventh seal was opened there were
[42:56] silence jesus when he was on earth they
[42:59] wanted to know when he would come he
[43:01] said it's not even the son himself don't
[43:04] know when it's going to happen
[43:07] see god has
[43:08] this all to himself it's a secret and
[43:11] that's the reason there was silence in
[43:12] heaven for space a half-hour and seven
[43:15] thunders ordered her voices and john was
[43:16] forbidding to write see the coming of
[43:19] the lord that's one thing he hasn't
[43:21] revealed of how he will come and when he
[43:24] will come it's a good thing that he
[43:26] doesn't no he has showed or revealed it
[43:28] in every type that's in the bible
[43:30] therefore the entire bible is a
[43:32] revelation of god's mystery in christ
[43:35] the entire bible is an expression of one
[43:37] goal that god had one purpose he wanted
[43:40] to achieve in the entire bible watch and
[43:43] all the acts of the of the believers
[43:47] in the bible has been in type and
[43:50] expressing what god's great goal is
[43:53] now in this last day he has revealed it
[43:56] and shows it and god help us we'll see
[43:58] it right here this morning
[44:00] all right
[44:02] a great mystery
[44:05] even tying he says
[44:09] to the coming of the lord
[44:12] well
[44:16] i've tried for 40 something years to
[44:18] preach about
[44:20] the things and not be
[44:24] and try to preach it right i believe
[44:28] brother brown said the seventh seal is
[44:29] the coming of the lord
[44:31] that's his coming
[44:34] well we don't know nothing about the
[44:35] seven seats we do know it's his coming
[44:38] we're not worried about other things
[44:40] that go around it or with it or whatever
[44:44] i'm not just arguing with you about what
[44:46] you would believe about it
[44:48] i'm just saying what he says it is
[44:51] all right that solves the problem
[44:53] he said it all right
[44:55] and that's it
[44:57] but the thing that is
[44:59] that we need to follow is what he goes
[45:01] on to say on paragraph 123 of christ is
[45:04] a mystery
[45:05] but if the thing is put together right
[45:08] there is the entire picture
[45:10] of the fall
[45:12] and regeneration
[45:17] the whole picture of creation
[45:20] and god's whole plan revealed right in
[45:24] jesus christ
[45:26] he said it's put together there all
[45:28] right
[45:29] now what is the coming of the lord we
[45:31] can say well it's this is that it's the
[45:33] tent visions it's the the uh this and
[45:35] you've got your third pulls you've got
[45:37] all you can just go all you want to and
[45:40] run but what did brother run say it says
[45:42] coming of the lord okay
[45:45] that's all that no problem
[45:47] the rest of it is discussion
[45:51] of what you think
[45:54] we're saying what he says to me that's
[45:57] not water baptism in the name of the
[45:59] lord jesus christ
[46:00] father son holy ghost is the lord jesus
[46:03] christ so matthew 28 19 is not contrary
[46:06] to acts 2 38.
[46:08] like people of this message i've heard
[46:09] them years ago say we take acts 2 38 for
[46:12] our baptism but they take matthew 28 19
[46:16] if the denomination took matthew 28 19
[46:19] they get baptized the name of the lord
[46:20] jesus christ
[46:23] that's taking your own interpretation
[46:25] because it does not say that
[46:27] right it's just quotes off of a page
[46:30] but listen
[46:33] what would it be then
[46:34] then that would be tied together
[46:37] and and
[46:38] see you you've got two things in the
[46:40] bible to be considered
[46:43] one is called the first coming
[46:46] of the lord
[46:48] all right the other is called the second
[46:50] coming
[46:51] of the lord
[46:54] right
[46:55] that's two things in the bible that it
[46:57] deals with
[46:59] it deals with his first coming
[47:02] and then it deals with his second coming
[47:06] all right so now his first coming would
[47:08] be all the things that we've been
[47:10] talking about
[47:11] that would start it on the other side of
[47:13] eternity in the beginning before the
[47:15] eternal and brought it across the line
[47:17] into
[47:19] the elements you know time and then
[47:22] bringing it down to like we were doing
[47:24] this morning bringing it down to the
[47:26] hour that we're living
[47:28] upon the word of god
[47:30] all right
[47:31] now then we know that it took
[47:35] 4 000 years to complete his first coming
[47:38] right
[47:40] right
[47:42] and it took 2 000 years
[47:45] to complete his second coming
[47:51] what's the problem then
[47:54] we're not relating to the things of what
[47:57] we think it is
[47:59] we're talking about the facts of the
[48:02] word of god
[48:04] that there's no you can't argue facts
[48:06] john the old saying go you can argue
[48:07] figures but you can't argue facts
[48:10] figures will mess you up the facts can't
[48:13] all right
[48:15] now
[48:16] see then
[48:17] we should be looking for
[48:22] something
[48:24] sorry lord for something
[48:26] no no way of saying it but
[48:30] you can't say
[48:32] the first coming is this
[48:36] but the second coming is different
[48:43] are you with me
[48:46] it may be in manifestation or reality or
[48:49] time periods they ain't gonna do it
[48:52] see whatever the first coming is that
[48:54] brought him here
[48:57] the second coming will be the same way
[49:00] or something related to that to bring
[49:02] him here again is that sensible
[49:08] you don't need a revelation for that do
[49:10] you
[49:12] we need a revelation to understand how
[49:14] it took place
[49:16] but it took him 4 000 years to get here
[49:19] the first time
[49:22] so all of that coming down through there
[49:24] was the coming of the lord
[49:28] when you see moses and all the things
[49:30] that was transpiring
[49:33] you see the lord on the scene
[49:38] all right
[49:39] he said well that's just covered under
[49:41] the anointing
[49:42] and there's where you're missing it then
[49:47] because you'd have balaam and him tied
[49:49] up in your anointing
[49:51] and you'd have them tied up in his
[49:52] coming
[49:53] and the coming of the lord can't be
[49:55] through balaam and
[49:59] see you
[50:00] you don't understand where you're you're
[50:03] condemning your own selves and what
[50:05] you're trying to study the word of god
[50:10] ever what it was the first time will be
[50:12] the second time
[50:15] because it brought him here
[50:18] the first time
[50:19] right
[50:23] it took all of those prophets
[50:25] and all of their doings
[50:28] to bring him here the first time and
[50:30] sure that was the christ dealing with
[50:32] them
[50:34] but something else was taking
[50:38] place all right in his second coming
[50:42] his second coming then would start on
[50:44] the day of pentecost right
[50:48] right
[50:50] any problem
[50:53] to the baptism of the holy ghost was the
[50:54] coming of the lord
[50:56] on the day of pentecost
[50:59] that's it
[51:02] no that was just no there's where you're
[51:04] going see you're going right back to
[51:06] where i i spent nearly an hour now
[51:08] trying to get you out of that you go
[51:09] right back no that was just a holy ghost
[51:11] that was just anointing
[51:15] but that anointing that fell on the day
[51:17] of pentecost
[51:21] was the new birth
[51:23] the baptism of the holy ghost amen
[51:27] it was not just an anointing
[51:30] of a spirit
[51:33] it was actually the birth
[51:35] of the church
[51:37] all right
[51:39] then
[51:40] thinking about it
[51:45] thinking about
[51:46] what happened
[51:48] abraham isaac jacob joseph
[51:51] prophets built the body john came to
[51:53] introduce
[51:54] every one of those prophets was part of
[51:56] the working of the coming of the lord
[52:02] amen not just an anointing
[52:05] i'm going to keep saying that to where
[52:07] you'll
[52:08] think about it
[52:09] it was the anointing yes praise god
[52:13] but that wasn't all of it
[52:16] because anointing would have failed when
[52:18] you got to the day of pentecost if it's
[52:20] just an anointing then
[52:22] you could not use it
[52:24] as especially and because that is
[52:27] divided
[52:28] and whether you believe it or not it's
[52:30] divided on the day of pentecost in the
[52:32] bible it never fell upon all mankind
[52:37] it failed up on 120 january
[52:40] it failed on 3000 january
[52:43] but in the last days it's promised i'll
[52:45] pour out my spirit upon all flesh
[52:51] there's where your anointed ones would
[52:52] come into being see then you'd have the
[52:55] coming of the lord just being an
[52:56] anointing
[53:03] there's more to it than just talk about
[53:05] the anointing right
[53:12] you're glad we ain't gonna have
[53:13] communion
[53:19] but you see what i'm talking about
[53:24] that it took the believers in the book
[53:26] brother brown said that is the bible
[53:30] you need that quote he said that is the
[53:31] bible the believers in the book
[53:34] the believers in the book is the bible
[53:36] the bible is is not the letters on the
[53:38] page
[53:41] see you'd say to me well brother dale
[53:42] hold up the bible most people would grab
[53:44] it you know they throw it up there like
[53:46] they'd say oh brother dale
[53:49] i ain't gonna try it but call it because
[53:50] i couldn't pick you up
[53:53] but you'd say to me where's the bible
[53:56] there's the bible
[54:00] paul was the bible peter was the bible
[54:02] john
[54:03] matthew mark
[54:06] the old testament you had ezekiel
[54:08] jeremiah moses
[54:11] all of those writings
[54:16] was manifesting something
[54:19] they would come forth then to bring the
[54:22] very god of glory
[54:24] do you believe that amen
[54:26] do you believe that jesus was almighty
[54:28] god
[54:30] he realized then it took all the
[54:31] believers of the old testament to bring
[54:33] him forth right
[54:35] and you leave out one of them
[54:37] we call a minor prophet major prophets
[54:40] but you you can't do that this that just
[54:41] signifying that they didn't bring the
[54:44] extent of the word
[54:45] that the others brought
[54:47] and some were records and different
[54:48] things but they're still prophets
[54:51] and without them you would not have a
[54:53] complete
[54:54] word
[54:56] that's right
[54:58] john would have stood out there and he
[54:59] said
[55:00] i want to introduce you to the
[55:02] two-thirds of the
[55:03] lamb of
[55:04] god
[55:06] you understand what i mean
[55:08] because you'd be saying that the other
[55:10] third didn't amount to nothing no no no
[55:12] there was a complete full bible
[55:16] and jesus christ walked out upon that
[55:18] word
[55:19] right right
[55:21] the believers
[55:22] had brought it to that place
[55:25] you realize then that mary had to give
[55:27] birth
[55:30] to the
[55:32] word right right
[55:35] you realize the bride is supposed to
[55:37] what
[55:39] give birth to the word
[55:42] but as mentioned to me here a while back
[55:44] about you're going to get into it one of
[55:46] these days we will because see there's
[55:47] another step in christ's mystery that
[55:49] you don't hear the preachers of this
[55:51] message bringing
[55:52] they bring the birth of the word and the
[55:54] bride is pragnated to give birth to the
[55:56] word
[55:57] but you better read
[56:00] brother around says mary
[56:02] was not
[56:04] the seed
[56:06] said she gave birth to the seed
[56:11] said because he was the seed
[56:16] see that means then there's got to be a
[56:18] step somewhere in this thing that
[56:20] somebody is going to be the seed
[56:24] not just give it birth
[56:27] they're going to be the seed was that
[56:29] would that be any problem when the
[56:30] brother branham was saying let's see how
[56:32] the messenger will be pointing to the
[56:37] sky
[56:39] pointing to a word born bride
[56:43] well i sure don't see it well then open
[56:45] your eyes
[56:47] and quit trying to figure it out by your
[56:50] own little category
[56:52] you're judging my apples by your rotten
[56:55] one
[56:57] and you know what all that'll do put
[56:58] them all in a barrel together just
[57:00] rotten whole barrel
[57:02] okay
[57:03] because that's all it'll do it'll mess
[57:04] it up all right well brother dave what
[57:06] are you getting at
[57:09] i'm getting to what i believe and what's
[57:11] been made known to me over all of these
[57:13] years
[57:15] and trying to put it in a category to
[57:17] help you to understand
[57:19] that this thing is not just an anointing
[57:25] right
[57:27] but it has to bring forth something that
[57:30] god had in his mind
[57:32] to fulfill all of his attributes
[57:36] now the anointing
[57:40] never brought
[57:41] the christ child
[57:45] i know it's going to require you think a
[57:47] little bit and consider this afternoon
[57:49] but please do it
[57:51] the anointing didn't bring the christ
[57:53] child
[57:59] there had to be a seed involved
[58:03] and it certainly wouldn't marry
[58:05] receiving the seed from gabriel
[58:07] as an intercourse now it's don't be
[58:09] stupid
[58:13] but mary had to receive from
[58:15] gabriel
[58:17] the seed
[58:21] the holy ghost shall overshadow thee
[58:24] and want to be created in you
[58:27] right
[58:28] will be the christ child
[58:30] she had to accept that
[58:32] that was more than just an anointing
[58:36] to fall upon her
[58:39] she met an actual
[58:41] angel to deliver
[58:43] and the holy spirit we know was the one
[58:45] because the angel couldn't do it the
[58:46] holy spirit is one that brought the
[58:48] physical part or we call the seed
[58:52] all right
[58:56] but you see we've read this
[58:59] today in it and i've got a bunch laying
[59:01] here but i won't bring them
[59:03] but we read over in ii peter
[59:07] that we were to be partakers of his
[59:10] divine nature
[59:15] now partakers of his divine nature is
[59:17] not just an anointing of spirit
[59:22] and remember the prophet said this is
[59:24] not to the world
[59:25] they can't have the divine nature of god
[59:27] sure they can have a portion of these
[59:29] virtues you know and they can do
[59:31] anything yes sir we know all about it
[59:33] but they cannot talk about his divine
[59:35] nature
[59:38] all right let me call it another part
[59:41] to where we can get it into today
[59:45] let me do it as brother branham and i'll
[59:47] bypass
[59:49] most of what i'm saying
[59:51] to bring it so if you get it fast enough
[59:53] brother anderson go ahead
[59:55] jump over to number nine that we've read
[59:57] so many times
[1:00:02] we want to go to number eight excuse me
[1:00:04] you must be born again a soul good or
[1:00:06] bad
[1:00:07] death doesn't change it
[1:00:10] i had a lot of scripture wrote down here
[1:00:13] on this one that i wanted to come in on
[1:00:15] what is a soul
[1:00:17] what skin what a soul is what is a soul
[1:00:20] it's you
[1:00:22] you are a soul
[1:00:24] the part inside of you
[1:00:26] and when you die every what shape that's
[1:00:28] holds in that's where it goes to its
[1:00:30] destination all right
[1:00:33] now
[1:00:34] you say well brother dale you spent a
[1:00:36] lot of time talking about it and we've
[1:00:38] heard you talk about
[1:00:40] that god was a soul
[1:00:44] now not have a soul because that can be
[1:00:47] just something impartation
[1:00:50] god is a soul because that's what he is
[1:00:52] a person the word soul means person or
[1:00:54] being or what you are
[1:00:57] all right
[1:00:59] now so look what he says here on the
[1:01:01] next one entombment go ahead and pull
[1:01:03] that one up which is
[1:01:05] number nine
[1:01:08] he talks about when jesus christ when he
[1:01:10] preached to the souls that were in
[1:01:11] prison that repented not the long
[1:01:13] suffering the days of noah his soul his
[1:01:15] spirit his theophany of his being
[1:01:19] went down
[1:01:21] now the prophet had no problem talking
[1:01:23] about
[1:01:24] the soul the spirit
[1:01:27] the person of his being going to hell
[1:01:30] call it a theophany
[1:01:32] call it that going over to number 10
[1:01:35] which is questions and answers in 1957
[1:01:38] and he's dealing with the point that
[1:01:40] i'll not leave my soul in hell
[1:01:42] neither will i suffer the holy one seek
[1:01:44] corruption how about that
[1:01:47] here's his body was in the grave and his
[1:01:49] soul was in hell preaching alive what
[1:01:51] about that he was in his theophany again
[1:01:53] his soul was down there with those
[1:01:56] people that were in theophany
[1:01:59] now you're going to argue with him so
[1:02:01] that's
[1:02:02] and you're not going to argue with me
[1:02:04] because it's not going to work
[1:02:06] we don't do it so let me get another one
[1:02:08] going to the number 11 which is the
[1:02:10] queen of sheba
[1:02:11] and read all the way up and down to
[1:02:13] where you want to god above us god with
[1:02:14] us god in us god and christ emmanuel god
[1:02:17] with us
[1:02:18] and then he gets down but when the life
[1:02:21] that was in the animal that died that
[1:02:23] life could not come back and be a spirit
[1:02:26] with the human being because it was
[1:02:28] animal life without a soul
[1:02:30] but when jesus died
[1:02:33] it was a soul of god
[1:02:37] all right
[1:02:39] and when that cell broke it could
[1:02:41] cleanse the church
[1:02:42] okay
[1:02:44] when divine love is projected sovereign
[1:02:46] grace takes over number 12. i used to
[1:02:49] think that god was angry with me but
[1:02:52] christ loved me but come to find out
[1:02:55] that christ is the very heart
[1:02:57] of god
[1:03:00] all right
[1:03:01] how many do you need on that the very
[1:03:02] heart of god where he's coming out of
[1:03:04] the garden
[1:03:06] in the very heart of god
[1:03:09] now
[1:03:10] heart is not
[1:03:12] heart is soul
[1:03:14] right
[1:03:15] heart is not your thumping gizzard
[1:03:19] heart is soul or center the heart of the
[1:03:22] peach is the center of it the seed it
[1:03:24] doesn't matter if it's offset just a
[1:03:25] little ain't got to be dead center but
[1:03:27] it's the heart of that seed all right
[1:03:30] now
[1:03:32] heart you can have a heart transplant
[1:03:36] that doesn't give you as we're talking
[1:03:37] about in a bible study last night you
[1:03:39] know you can have a heart transplant
[1:03:42] that doesn't give you another heart or
[1:03:44] somebody take your heart and then they
[1:03:46] they got you they got your soul
[1:03:50] and they give you somebody else's heart
[1:03:52] you got their soul
[1:03:54] now
[1:03:55] that's getting
[1:03:56] you know and i know i know unless it's
[1:03:59] explained that's a question
[1:04:02] that's been around the message ever
[1:04:03] since i've been around the message for
[1:04:05] 50 years because that's what they used
[1:04:07] to argue about along about 50 years ago
[1:04:10] they were just making and it started out
[1:04:12] making a mechanical heart
[1:04:14] and you know the guy did live for quite
[1:04:15] a while with a straight mechanical heart
[1:04:21] now it's probably updated now so much on
[1:04:23] it to get it to work
[1:04:25] and live a long time
[1:04:27] and i told them last night i said i need
[1:04:29] a transplant of my brain
[1:04:35] but you could take my head off sister
[1:04:37] gayle put another head on it i might
[1:04:38] look like brother dick if i put his head
[1:04:40] on me but i ain't gonna be him and ain't
[1:04:42] gonna think like him cause that's not
[1:04:44] the point it's not that it's all up here
[1:04:46] in this brain and that's your spirit
[1:04:50] it's through that
[1:04:52] it's what you are
[1:04:54] right
[1:04:55] your soul
[1:04:58] because you were made in the image of
[1:05:00] god
[1:05:03] is that true
[1:05:04] we spent a long time talking about it
[1:05:07] in the image of god soul theophany logo
[1:05:10] our speech
[1:05:12] son of god christ
[1:05:15] the anointings we've been quite quite a
[1:05:17] while on it
[1:05:20] you see
[1:05:25] it's not to change a heart the bible
[1:05:27] says i take out a stony heart and they
[1:05:30] give you a heart of flesh what does that
[1:05:31] mean
[1:05:33] well my heart was hard so he took it out
[1:05:36] and he put me in one it's soft now
[1:05:39] no no it's still the same old one that
[1:05:42] was taken before it's just ticking now
[1:05:45] what does it mean
[1:05:48] take out the heart of you
[1:05:52] not take the soul out of you but work on
[1:05:55] that soul until he mellows that soul
[1:05:59] that being that you are
[1:06:04] what else are you going to say it is
[1:06:06] give you a heart of flesh when i got my
[1:06:08] ideas
[1:06:09] okay with your ideas
[1:06:11] but you tell me where it's at
[1:06:15] but you see that's the thing that we've
[1:06:17] never seen i'll just close the notes and
[1:06:19] preach
[1:06:21] that's the point that the lord's dealt
[1:06:22] with me over these years to try to get
[1:06:24] you to understand
[1:06:28] that
[1:06:29] his plan and purpose was not to just be
[1:06:32] an anointing to come upon people to make
[1:06:35] us
[1:06:36] something
[1:06:37] his plan and purpose was to come down
[1:06:41] and be
[1:06:42] the very soul
[1:06:44] and bring the soul of mankind into being
[1:06:51] to where he could fellowship with us
[1:06:56] and then he could come down on the day
[1:06:57] of pentecost
[1:06:59] and give birth to that soul we'll get to
[1:07:01] that a little later
[1:07:03] on what we're talking about the new
[1:07:04] birth and you'll see better
[1:07:09] he came down on the day of pentecost
[1:07:14] he took the anointing and took the
[1:07:15] things and cleansed out
[1:07:19] 120.
[1:07:21] like i said why didn't the other 380
[1:07:23] show up
[1:07:25] they didn't get cleaned out and getting
[1:07:26] prepared so they missed it
[1:07:31] i ain't saying they didn't come on night
[1:07:33] saying they wasn't part of the three
[1:07:34] thousand
[1:07:35] uh it's none of my business cause it
[1:07:37] does call them brethren
[1:07:39] all right which could signify that they
[1:07:41] did become
[1:07:42] later
[1:07:43] but at that time they wasn't in the
[1:07:44] upper room
[1:07:46] why because it wasn't that important to
[1:07:49] them
[1:07:50] the bible says in the parables where
[1:07:52] jesus was given the parable he said and
[1:07:54] they took the word
[1:07:56] and held it
[1:07:59] you read that in the bible
[1:08:03] we see that 120 in the upper room held
[1:08:04] onto that word because they finally got
[1:08:06] down to the end of it what did they say
[1:08:08] to jesus we don't understand but we know
[1:08:10] one thing now that's the words of
[1:08:12] eternal life
[1:08:14] so we'll just do what you say
[1:08:16] well at least he said do you finally
[1:08:18] believe
[1:08:22] you see what was happening now let me
[1:08:24] give illustrations like we did this
[1:08:25] morning for a minute
[1:08:27] then can you follow the soul of god down
[1:08:30] through the bible
[1:08:32] you would agree this morning at least
[1:08:34] you're not as your head or smile or
[1:08:36] something you know
[1:08:37] amen you know
[1:08:39] i'm talking about the anointing and
[1:08:40] seeing it coming down
[1:08:45] when i remember
[1:08:47] the anointing
[1:08:49] was not what worked upon david
[1:08:54] that got goliath killed
[1:08:59] it wasn't the anointing that condemned
[1:09:01] david
[1:09:06] it wasn't the anointing that
[1:09:07] straightened david out right
[1:09:11] there was something working upon the
[1:09:13] heart of the man
[1:09:16] will you agree with that
[1:09:20] that it was working upon that man
[1:09:23] and on his way home from the bed with
[1:09:25] bathsheba
[1:09:26] schofield even picks that up
[1:09:29] he said lord return unto me the joy thy
[1:09:31] salvation
[1:09:34] reading the psalms and look how many
[1:09:36] times he says my soul
[1:09:38] thirsteth after thee o god
[1:09:43] my soul
[1:09:45] read the psalms
[1:09:46] and see how many times it mentions soul
[1:09:55] what was that in moses
[1:09:58] he met a bush yeah
[1:10:01] he told him moses you go on my angel
[1:10:03] will go with you
[1:10:05] i keep wanting to walk over there okay
[1:10:08] my angel will go with you moses
[1:10:12] we see something struck into the heart
[1:10:14] of a man
[1:10:17] that a man said
[1:10:20] okay
[1:10:22] i'll go
[1:10:26] no matter what happens to me i'm gonna
[1:10:27] go tell him what truth of it is
[1:10:30] why is it that we spend so much time and
[1:10:33] how many times did brother branham
[1:10:35] preach on abraham and his faith
[1:10:39] right
[1:10:40] how many times he preached on abraham
[1:10:42] and his faith
[1:10:44] that a man
[1:10:46] not because an anointing was upon him
[1:10:51] but a man
[1:10:52] that would believe god
[1:10:56] when god says get your family get out of
[1:10:58] here i got something for you
[1:11:03] it wasn't just dealing in the spirit
[1:11:07] right
[1:11:10] how long could you preach on what i'm
[1:11:12] talking about that down through that old
[1:11:14] testament you see the very soul of
[1:11:15] almighty god
[1:11:18] anointing
[1:11:19] anointing in the fiery furnace
[1:11:24] uh unfolds
[1:11:27] that anointing would have just went
[1:11:31] wormwood you remember brother branham
[1:11:36] you remember him what he said
[1:11:38] wormwood said you know he's the one
[1:11:40] destroyed the world with water he said
[1:11:42] let me go down i'll put that fire out
[1:11:44] so don't you see what you're doing
[1:11:47] he said just hold on a minute
[1:11:51] he let it get real bad but you know what
[1:11:54] he said he said i'm going down myself
[1:12:00] i'm not going to send somebody else i
[1:12:01] ain't sending you wormwood i'm going
[1:12:03] down myself
[1:12:06] and when a man looked down in there a
[1:12:08] center man looked down in
[1:12:11] he saw four men
[1:12:13] right
[1:12:14] something was changing that man's sin
[1:12:17] until he looked down and he said
[1:12:19] and he was like the son of god
[1:12:27] who was it in moses
[1:12:32] and as your prophet said it
[1:12:35] that it looked like moses told god a
[1:12:38] better way of doing it
[1:12:41] remember the story
[1:12:49] moses said lord if you're going to kick
[1:12:50] them people you're going to take me
[1:12:52] first
[1:12:54] that wasn't no anointing
[1:12:59] anointing would have said hey okey-dokey
[1:13:01] we're just going to take over for you
[1:13:03] we'll just get rid of them
[1:13:07] but can you see throughout that old
[1:13:09] testament
[1:13:10] the very divine nature of almighty god
[1:13:13] as it's unfolding down through the old
[1:13:16] testament coming forth
[1:13:20] and see him
[1:13:22] coming to the to the basis of of the
[1:13:25] prophets and the things that they done
[1:13:30] like i said about moses that could tell
[1:13:31] god a better way of doing something
[1:13:34] he brought around and said
[1:13:37] i wondered about that till i saw it was
[1:13:39] christ
[1:13:41] now he wouldn't talk about just an
[1:13:42] anointing right
[1:13:46] now the anointing would have done what
[1:13:48] remember moses you remember the god that
[1:13:51] was the king second in command
[1:13:53] and you know him by seeing christ
[1:13:57] he left
[1:14:00] is that right am i in the bible
[1:14:04] he went to
[1:14:06] egypt but he come out of there as a
[1:14:08] conqueror
[1:14:09] and like i was saying this morning then
[1:14:12] isn't it odd that he said moses said now
[1:14:15] god who do i tell them he said i'm not
[1:14:17] going god said i'm the god of abraham
[1:14:20] isaac and jacob
[1:14:23] you know how i've always paraphrased
[1:14:24] that because it's good to me
[1:14:26] moses said okey dokey they had you they
[1:14:29] each one had you for their time but i'm
[1:14:31] not going because of what they had
[1:14:35] said what do i tell him
[1:14:38] he said
[1:14:39] just tell him i am
[1:14:43] sent you
[1:14:45] it goes down to egypt
[1:14:47] pharaoh says who's gonna tell me he said
[1:14:49] i am
[1:14:52] he becomes so personal with the god
[1:14:55] until his
[1:14:56] thoughts was upon the people
[1:14:59] and you tell me that to moses didn't
[1:15:01] have
[1:15:02] the soul of god dealing with him
[1:15:05] in the divine nature not as a new birth
[1:15:07] now come on we're going to get to that
[1:15:09] if i have to close i'll start wednesday
[1:15:13] not talking about
[1:15:14] the new birth
[1:15:16] moses didn't have it
[1:15:18] but that divine nature of god that soul
[1:15:21] of almighty god
[1:15:27] was right there
[1:15:31] and he loved the people
[1:15:34] and he was willing to die with the
[1:15:36] people
[1:15:38] whatever it took
[1:15:40] all right
[1:15:43] we see then one day that verse we read
[1:15:45] jesus was the very heart and soul of god
[1:15:49] why because he was god
[1:15:54] there walked on the shores of galilee a
[1:15:56] man that wasn't like moses who said let
[1:15:59] me kill him
[1:16:01] wasn't like david give me a sword
[1:16:07] here's a man that had the very soul of
[1:16:09] almighty god
[1:16:11] because he was the soul of almighty god
[1:16:13] in
[1:16:14] in christ
[1:16:17] he turned the other cheek
[1:16:21] right
[1:16:23] he loved the sinner right
[1:16:26] you do him wrong he didn't fight back
[1:16:32] because he did have the divine nature
[1:16:34] because he was a divine nature right
[1:16:39] right
[1:16:42] now what are you and i supposed to have
[1:16:46] and maybe you'll see why we're not too
[1:16:47] far up the pyramid maybe
[1:16:51] because that's talking about the divine
[1:16:53] nature
[1:16:54] that comes to you after you're born
[1:16:56] again right
[1:16:58] sure you get the divine nature when
[1:16:59] you're born again by the faith the love
[1:17:02] of god coming into you
[1:17:04] right yeah okay
[1:17:06] but then you're partakers of the divine
[1:17:08] nature as you grow in grace and
[1:17:09] knowledge
[1:17:11] not in knowledge of head
[1:17:18] but when we come to a place of it being
[1:17:20] part of us
[1:17:24] do you see what i'm talking about you
[1:17:25] see where i've been headed for months
[1:17:29] to go back after coming down through
[1:17:31] there and seeing that
[1:17:34] and realizing where sin took place at
[1:17:36] and what it was in
[1:17:37] and realizing the spot that god would
[1:17:39] have to start dealing
[1:17:41] do you realize he had to start dealing
[1:17:43] with those disciples
[1:17:44] in their memory reason conscious
[1:17:48] affections
[1:17:55] and he planted the word
[1:17:58] into their soul
[1:18:00] their being
[1:18:03] but then he had to give his own life
[1:18:06] that word to be able to be made alive
[1:18:12] can you see the soul of god as it come
[1:18:13] down through the bible
[1:18:17] and it's still coming down how it's
[1:18:19] unfolded down to the present hour that
[1:18:21] we're living the plan and purpose of god
[1:18:28] it's not just an anointing coming down
[1:18:35] take the anointing and you can die and
[1:18:37] go to hell
[1:18:40] take the new birth
[1:18:41] and your heaven bound
[1:18:45] you're fulfilling all the things
[1:18:48] that those men back there couldn't
[1:18:49] comprehend why
[1:18:52] but they would sing about him
[1:18:54] they pierced my hands and my feet
[1:19:00] no writings in there of him fighting
[1:19:01] back
[1:19:04] right
[1:19:06] no writings of this that's why man
[1:19:07] couldn't understand him because there he
[1:19:09] come as a baby they was expecting a
[1:19:12] warrior
[1:19:15] even when he got up to the disciples
[1:19:17] will you restore the kingdom
[1:19:20] even after his resurrection in the book
[1:19:23] of acts
[1:19:25] i believe it's acts 1 and 8 somewhere
[1:19:26] right in there
[1:19:28] after his resurrection
[1:19:32] after his talking to him after him
[1:19:35] fellowshipping with them for a time
[1:19:37] they still said you're going to restore
[1:19:38] the kingdom to israel
[1:19:40] brother brown said they still had their
[1:19:42] mind on a literal kingdom
[1:19:46] he said but it wasn't the literal
[1:19:48] kingdom that jesus was speaking of it
[1:19:49] was a spiritual kingdom
[1:19:53] do you see the soul of god
[1:19:59] you see the divine nature of almighty
[1:20:01] god as it unfolds to the word
[1:20:05] it is it comes down
[1:20:08] to you and i
[1:20:13] the soul the prophet said is worth a
[1:20:15] million worlds
[1:20:20] he said if there was one
[1:20:22] and that's all there was
[1:20:24] he said he would have still went to
[1:20:26] calvary
[1:20:28] and died for that one
[1:20:35] see we think it's just an anointing
[1:20:37] the new birth is not just an anointing
[1:20:40] the new birth is the receiving of
[1:20:43] eternal life
[1:20:47] that's what caught me when i heard this
[1:20:48] man we preached about
[1:20:52] eternal life
[1:20:54] but we preached it one of these days
[1:20:55] we're going to get it because it's up
[1:20:57] yonder somewhere
[1:21:00] but this man began to talk about eternal
[1:21:02] life here
[1:21:05] changed my whole thinking you want to
[1:21:07] know what caught me that
[1:21:10] that he spoke of a god that was real in
[1:21:13] my day
[1:21:18] not a god of the past or a god of the
[1:21:20] future he spoke of a god in reality was
[1:21:23] right here
[1:21:28] he spoke of the coming of the lord
[1:21:33] and the first coming brought
[1:21:36] the soul of god down through time
[1:21:41] what's the second coming to be then
[1:21:46] we'll see we've got it all figured out
[1:21:47] it's got to be the third fourth gotta be
[1:21:48] this gonna be happening
[1:21:52] what did he say when he got to the seals
[1:21:55] he said go on into simplicity
[1:21:59] i'm paraphrasing it but it's very close
[1:22:02] he said because if you don't you'll work
[1:22:05] your way away from it
[1:22:09] continue as you are
[1:22:17] but everybody's trying to figure it out
[1:22:20] instead of sitting back and looking at
[1:22:22] reality of what it's been
[1:22:25] well brother dale i always thought
[1:22:26] coming to the lord resisted come to the
[1:22:27] lord was that well
[1:22:32] it's got to be the coming of the lord
[1:22:35] that's plain sins
[1:22:38] right
[1:22:39] and if it's the coming of the lord he's
[1:22:41] been coming he's come already
[1:22:44] because there's a first coming in a
[1:22:45] second coming right in the bible
[1:22:49] we are in the second coming right
[1:22:54] and if they were partakers and brought
[1:22:56] had to be there to bring the first
[1:22:58] coming what do you think is happening
[1:23:00] through you and i today
[1:23:02] it's bringing to christ the second
[1:23:04] coming of jesus christ
[1:23:08] coming to christ in what did he say
[1:23:10] bright form
[1:23:14] bright form
[1:23:19] the coming of the lord
[1:23:21] is the revealing of his word
[1:23:24] or making his word alive
[1:23:27] that has been written
[1:23:30] now you can talk about all the other
[1:23:31] things you think it's related to this
[1:23:33] and think it's related to that
[1:23:35] but you remember you got to come back to
[1:23:36] where
[1:23:37] your anchor is in the word
[1:23:40] first coming
[1:23:41] brought jesus christ in human flesh
[1:23:44] the second coming
[1:23:46] will be now you're going to listen
[1:23:51] we're not the finish of the second
[1:23:53] coming
[1:24:00] come on
[1:24:01] been in the message too long i'm quote
[1:24:03] too good
[1:24:06] the second coming of jesus christ
[1:24:12] this is the bride coming to christ
[1:24:15] coming out of the church
[1:24:17] the second coming of jesus christ
[1:24:19] is in the millennium
[1:24:27] okay use something to think about
[1:24:30] the second coming is in the millennium
[1:24:34] because in the millennium he has
[1:24:37] everything connected to his coming from
[1:24:40] the beginning to the end because the
[1:24:42] millennium will be to the jews
[1:24:45] right
[1:24:47] not to you and i we're there on a
[1:24:48] honeymoon but we're there on a honeymoon
[1:24:50] so that that'll put us there that puts
[1:24:52] the jews there that's your second coming
[1:24:54] of jesus christ
[1:24:57] now if you don't believe that go into
[1:24:59] matthew
[1:25:00] um
[1:25:01] my goodness what is it
[1:25:04] is it 17
[1:25:08] we're speaking of moses and elijah
[1:25:11] yeah right
[1:25:12] you know brother brown said that is the
[1:25:15] second coming
[1:25:19] who moses and elijah to who to the jews
[1:25:25] right
[1:25:26] so the second coming will climax to you
[1:25:29] and i the rapture yes
[1:25:32] that's the beautiful part
[1:25:34] but the reality of the finality will be
[1:25:36] to the jews in the millennium when they
[1:25:38] see him standing on earth
[1:25:45] and they'll say where did you get the
[1:25:47] nail prints through the two prophets
[1:25:49] but then when it finishes up
[1:25:51] they won't just talk about seeing it
[1:25:54] they will see that they are in the
[1:25:55] millennial reign because the millennial
[1:25:57] reign is to the jews
[1:26:01] oh what a wonderful beautiful picture
[1:26:03] that's why even your feel sealed you
[1:26:05] has to be tied into it that's why
[1:26:08] there's got to be a resurrection
[1:26:14] come on we go to that welcome table
[1:26:16] brother tatum love that scripture to the
[1:26:18] welcome table what
[1:26:20] with guests
[1:26:21] with abraham isaac and jacob
[1:26:26] they'll be at the marriage supper
[1:26:29] and a welcome table
[1:26:31] there won't be bride
[1:26:34] the jews will be in the millennium won't
[1:26:36] be bright
[1:26:37] but it's a promise to them
[1:26:42] they will be the servants
[1:26:46] and if you don't nothing more than just
[1:26:48] 144 000. brother branham says in the
[1:26:50] church age book right in the beginning
[1:26:52] i'll find it for you that that 144 000
[1:26:54] will be in the millennium
[1:26:57] if you want to argue the point of
[1:26:58] whether they're going to be here or that
[1:27:00] but i believe the feel sealed jew will
[1:27:02] be in the millennium because brother
[1:27:04] brown says the millennium is to the jews
[1:27:07] as a nation
[1:27:10] because of the promise to david
[1:27:14] you sit on his throne
[1:27:16] he said he'll sit on that throne in the
[1:27:18] millennial ring
[1:27:20] you know who's going to be on that
[1:27:21] throne with him
[1:27:23] his wife
[1:27:27] so then as this morning i covered it you
[1:27:29] can follow the anointing to come down
[1:27:32] but now can you see the very heart and
[1:27:34] soul of almighty god
[1:27:36] as it developed unthrough the bible
[1:27:39] to bring his first coming and now to
[1:27:41] develop into bringing his second coming
[1:27:48] you might not think that means a lot but
[1:27:50] i do
[1:27:52] come on brothers
[1:27:54] let's stand
[1:27:58] when we talk about the coming of the
[1:27:59] lord we got it all figured out is this
[1:28:00] that or the other
[1:28:03] well
[1:28:04] let's start where i'm at and then we can
[1:28:06] go on to other things
[1:28:09] you say oh yeah well it's what i said
[1:28:11] the truth
[1:28:19] if it's the truth then that's where we
[1:28:20] must put our bases upon the word of god
[1:28:23] that's right
[1:28:25] not upon your idea or my idea
[1:28:29] but upon god's word
[1:28:32] and it'll all be finished
[1:28:34] anybody have a need with
[1:28:37] what we got brother
[1:28:46] think on these things
[1:29:02] bless you
[1:29:24] do you know that savior as your new
[1:29:26] birth
[1:29:40] can you follow the christ down through
[1:29:41] the bible
[1:29:44] can you follow the very soul and person
[1:29:46] or being of god as he's made itself
[1:29:50] manifest down through the bible
[1:29:53] right down to where we are now
[1:29:58] you see why we keep putting the title
[1:30:01] the glory
[1:30:03] of his person
[1:30:06] because when we get back to that it'll
[1:30:08] be very easy to preach
[1:30:11] because you can go back and see it
[1:30:13] higher like wool
[1:30:17] his feet that's
[1:30:18] right you can see all the way through
[1:30:20] the bible
[1:30:24] his person is being revealed
[1:30:28] king jesus
[1:30:59] either side
[1:31:06] oh
[1:31:26] why don't you believe
[1:31:29] why don't it
[1:31:30] release your faith
[1:31:54] oh jesus our little sister to her dad
[1:31:58] and you'll be with her let her shine the
[1:32:00] light of christ
[1:32:02] let everything be okay we send this for
[1:32:04] a safe journey
[1:32:06] back and for her to be taken care of in
[1:32:09] jesus name
[1:32:12] anybody else
[1:32:22] we were talking this morning
[1:32:24] sister johnny had told us about a
[1:32:26] situation that where brother is a
[1:32:29] is a minister in a church
[1:32:31] and that to get this big name person to
[1:32:34] come
[1:32:35] for 45 minutes it cost him 15
[1:32:39] for the guy to come 45 minutes
[1:32:42] and the pastor never shook hands with
[1:32:44] him
[1:32:45] because they brought him in he delivered
[1:32:47] his point and back out with his little
[1:32:49] group and left and the pastor never even
[1:32:51] shook his hand
[1:32:54] but it cost him fifteen thousand dollars
[1:32:58] i said you know i'm kind of a dumb
[1:32:59] person i guess
[1:33:01] but if i knew a guy in california or
[1:33:04] china india whatever
[1:33:06] that i knew could help you
[1:33:10] you know could help you
[1:33:12] to understand
[1:33:14] god's word
[1:33:15] i wouldn't cure to spend twenty thousand
[1:33:18] fifty thousand
[1:33:19] that's nothing to me
[1:33:22] i just want to see you helped
[1:33:25] and i wouldn't care
[1:33:28] but i'd want them to feed you while
[1:33:30] they're here and it wouldn't matter to
[1:33:31] me whether i shook the person's hand or
[1:33:33] not
[1:33:34] i wouldn't care it's just whether or not
[1:33:37] that they'd feed you
[1:33:39] that's how much i care about you
[1:33:42] that i would spend the money just to get
[1:33:44] the person here that i'm happy
[1:33:48] but see then i know in real life if if
[1:33:50] it was some noted name you know and had
[1:33:53] to have that then he wouldn't be able to
[1:33:54] help you so we ain't gonna get him
[1:33:57] okay
[1:33:59] we ain't gonna have to pay it okay
[1:34:01] cause he ain't gonna help you okay you
[1:34:03] gotta have fifty thousand dollars to get
[1:34:05] here he ain't gonna help but pay his
[1:34:06] ticket here okay
[1:34:09] you know
[1:34:10] that's fine
[1:34:12] to pay his expenses but if you
[1:34:14] understand the point
[1:34:17] to get somebody to help you
[1:34:20] i search constantly through
[1:34:22] listening
[1:34:24] to try to find brothers that i believe
[1:34:26] that can help you
[1:34:28] and i want them to come and deliver
[1:34:29] their heart
[1:34:31] to you
[1:34:33] because i want them to help you
[1:34:37] that's my goal
[1:34:38] is to help you
[1:34:40] anything else why does it make any
[1:34:41] difference
[1:34:44] what does it matter about life and money
[1:34:46] and doing something
[1:34:49] well brother dale is as poor as i am
[1:34:56] but you see for churches all in trying
[1:34:59] to get you to see christ
[1:35:02] and what he's doing
[1:35:04] is my goal not what he has done
[1:35:07] and what he will do but what he's doing
[1:35:10] right now
[1:35:11] because that tomorrow won't help you
[1:35:14] yesterday can be a foundation to kind of
[1:35:17] help your faith and do it
[1:35:19] you that saw brother branham and saw the
[1:35:21] ministry and the things and know about
[1:35:24] the way that he's done and all that's a
[1:35:26] help to you
[1:35:27] right thank god
[1:35:30] but that still ain't gonna save you
[1:35:34] won't save you to think about what he
[1:35:36] was it'll save you when you try to get
[1:35:38] the same god in you that he had in him
[1:35:41] because that was his goal right
[1:35:44] that was his point
[1:35:45] let's sing one more then we'll
[1:35:55] to quit
[1:35:56] the fire going
[1:36:02] until
[1:36:34] salvation is the only thing
[1:36:38] that once you get it
[1:36:39] you want to give it away
[1:36:42] and if you don't want to give it away i
[1:36:44] know you don't understand my language
[1:36:46] i'm not talking like that but if you got
[1:36:49] salvation and you don't want to know
[1:36:51] about something that you can give it to
[1:36:53] somebody else
[1:36:54] if it's impossible then you don't have
[1:36:56] it
[1:37:01] because this is spiritual multiplication
[1:37:07] you get the seed you plant the seed
[1:37:11] god will quicken the seed
[1:37:13] into the hearts
[1:37:15] of other
[1:37:19] sit people
[1:37:24] i wish for you my friend
[1:37:28] this happiness
[1:37:35] you can't
[1:37:36] depend on him
[1:37:58] has come to me
[1:38:00] i
[1:38:05] what is a christian life living for
[1:38:07] others
[1:38:09] because you know what i love what
[1:38:10] brother brown said one day he said
[1:38:12] it takes god to be a man
[1:38:16] he said it takes christ
[1:38:18] to be a christian
[1:38:22] he was the only man that was worth
[1:38:24] anything
[1:38:26] and that life in him coming back up on
[1:38:30] you're dismissed lord jesus
[1:38:33] just blessed father as we're dismissed
[1:38:35] and we go home
[1:38:36] give everybody a safe journey
[1:38:38] we love you we thank you
[1:38:41] in jesus name
[1:38:43] you're dismissed
[1:39:01] i want the world to know
[1:39:31] there
[1:40:06] you
