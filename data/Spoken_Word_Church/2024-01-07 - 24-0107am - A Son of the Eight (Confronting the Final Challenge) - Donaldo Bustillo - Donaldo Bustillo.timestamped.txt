[3:06] what we thank God for yes sir we going
[3:09] to read this morning
[3:11] from St
[3:13] Matthew the 6th chapter versus I think I
[3:17] told him 1 through 15 I might told him
[3:20] 14 but we read 1 through
[3:28] 15
[3:30] let us
[3:31] pray heavenly father again we are
[3:34] thankful that we have this opportunity
[3:37] Lord to come together to worship Lord
[3:39] and to thank you for all that you have
[3:42] done for us Lord all that you're doing
[3:44] in our lives day by day Lord Satan May
[3:47] rage and try to destroy us and
[3:49] discourage us Lord with your stripes we
[3:52] are healed God we thank you for it and
[3:55] we ask you to bless the service this
[3:57] morning for every need that everyone has
[4:00] Lord It's a struggle or whatever it may
[4:03] be God we ask that you will Comfort them
[4:05] and take it away in Jesus Christ name we
[4:08] pray
[4:13] amen St Matthew chapter 6 1-
[4:20] 15 take heed that you
[4:24] do that you do not your arms before men
[4:28] to be seen of them
[4:30] otherwise you have no reward of your
[4:34] father which is in
[4:42] heaven
[4:45] hoc the
[4:47] street
[4:54] Glory but when thou doth arms let not
[5:00] your left hand know what the right hand
[5:14] doth and when thou prayest thou shall
[5:18] not be as the Hypocrites are for thy
[5:22] love to for they love to pray standing
[5:25] in the synagog and in the corners of the
[5:29] street that they may be seen of men
[5:32] verely I say unto you they have their
[5:47] reward
[5:51] inet but when you
[5:53] pray use not vain repetition as the
[5:56] Heathen do for they think that they
[6:00] shall be heard for their much
[6:07] speaking father
[6:14] know and this manner therefore pray ye
[6:17] Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed
[6:20] be thy name th Kingdom Come will be done
[6:25] in earth as it is in heaven give us this
[6:29] day our our daily bread and for our as
[6:33] we forgive
[6:34] our and lead us not into temptation but
[6:39] Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the
[6:42] kingdom and the power and the glory
[6:45] forever
[6:50] amen
[6:53] father but if you forgive not these
[6:57] trespasses neither shall tell your
[6:59] father forgive your trespasses amen God
[7:04] bless you you may be
[7:10] seated thank
[7:14] you

[7:19] read this morning I was thinking about I
[7:22] think it's uh verse four it says that
[7:25] thine arms may be in secret and thy
[7:28] father which seeth
[7:30] in secret shall reward thee openly that
[7:33] is such a promise I've seen that so many
[7:36] times in my own life you know there's
[7:38] times where you might uh come into
[7:41] contact with somebody and say well
[7:42] what's God doing I don't see God doing
[7:44] anything but here's a prophet that
[7:47] preaches a sermons called The Invisible

[16:24] sing this chorus once
[16:26] more let let 20 24 be a year of
[16:30] Thanksgiving in your life there's a key
[16:33] to
[16:34] confessing and not just confessing but
[16:37] being
[16:38] thankful every time when brother Ram
[16:40] would pray for people they still had
[16:42] their condition he said go thank him
[16:45] thank him for what faith is calling that
[16:48] which is not as though it is whatever
[16:51] you have in your life that you need or
[16:53] you don't need just start thinking in
[16:54] for it and see that materialize that is
[16:57] speaking the word by faith and it is a
[17:00] heart of gratitude that God can come on
[17:03] the scene and when you realize it's not
[17:06] just what you don't have is the
[17:07] blessings you already have I mean that's
[17:10] what brother John was trying to show us
[17:12] this morning was what we already got in
[17:15] God that's our promises that's all he's
[17:18] just pouring out his riches God rich in
[17:20] Mercy to you start thanking him for it
[17:24] and see it come to pass I truly believe
[17:28] that
[17:29] you know brother Wade said 2023 was the
[17:31] letting out letting out now we got we
[17:34] got a a a basket full of Thanksgiving to
[17:37] give God back to and I truly believe if
[17:40] that is our confession start thinking
[17:42] him for the things you don't have you
[17:45] need you do have for your children for
[17:48] your family for the Holy Ghost for more
[17:51] of him whatever it is start thinking him
[17:54] for it and you'll see overcoming power
[17:57] in your life truly believe that do you
[18:00] believe that let's sing that chorus once
[18:02] more as by the way com and I've got so
[18:07] much to thank him

[30:52] can
[30:52] see what God is getting to give to know

[30:59] so we're not going to take a whole lot
[31:00] of
[31:01] time let's go straight to the
[31:04] word and I believe that is the the most

[31:13] happy and to see
[31:15] you and that you are the
[31:18] Warriors of this last
[31:20] age the ones that were

[31:26] challenge
[31:28] and there is a
[31:29] challenge and there was a man in the
[31:32] Bible called David and
[31:35] David and David was the indicated
[31:39] man to confront the final
[31:43] challenge that's why we want to speak in
[31:45] this
[31:46] hour now let's go straight to the
[31:49] Bible and then we're going to take uh
[31:51] the book of First of
[31:54] Samuel chapter
[31:56] 16
[31:58] verse 17 all the way through
[32:04] 13 first of
[32:08] Samuel we're going to go all the way
[32:10] from Seven all the way through
[32:15] 13 we read the his word in the name of
[32:18] our Lord Jesus
[32:26] Christ
[32:37] but the Lord said unto Samuel look not
[32:40] on his continent or on the height of his
[32:42] statue because I have refused him for
[32:45] the Lord seeth not as men seeth for man
[32:49] lookth on the outward appearance but the
[32:52] Lord lookth on their
[32:56] heart
[33:04] then Jesse called abinadab and made him
[33:07] pass before Samuel and he said neither
[33:10] hath the Lord chosen
[33:17] this then Jesse made shama to pass by
[33:22] and he said neither hath the Lord chosen
[33:25] this
[33:36] and again Jesse made Seven of his sons
[33:39] to pass before Samuel and Samuel said
[33:42] unto Jesse the Lord had not chosen
[33:55] these
[34:05] and Samuel said unto Jesse are here all
[34:08] the children and he said There remaineth
[34:11] Yet the youngest and behold he keepeth
[34:14] the sheep and Samuel said unto Jesse
[34:16] send and fetch him for he will not sit
[34:19] down until he come
[34:25] hi
[34:33] and he and he sent and brought him in
[34:37] and now he was rooted and with all of
[34:39] his beautiful countenance and God goodly
[34:42] to look to and the Lord said arise
[34:46] anoint him for this is
[34:55] he
[35:05] then Samuel took the Horn of oil
[35:08] anointed him in the midst of his
[35:11] Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came
[35:14] Upon David from that day forward so

[47:51] brandom what are you going to do
[47:54] now you know you your seven had run
[47:58] out what are you going to do
[48:02] now you a dispension
[48:07] dispension all the types of
[48:09] dispensational had run
[48:13] out are you going to put more than the
[48:17] seventh
[48:19] day how are you going to obtain it how
[48:21] are you going to do

[48:41] [Music]
[48:42] something you know me I have not run out
[48:45] out of
[48:47] dispensation I still have scripture for
[48:50] that I have another
[48:53] scripture glory to God
[48:56] and now he was going to go to the Bible
[48:59] and I continue
[49:02] reading now you say this brother
[49:06] [Music]
[49:08] brandom and brother are you trying to
[49:10] place something more than the seventh
[49:17] day and then they ask him where is your
[49:20] type now
[49:21] brother you know you say you're a a
[49:24] you're a type
[49:28] and then you have run out of
[49:30] types and brother Bram said no I have
[49:33] not run out of types no I have not run
[49:36] out of
[49:37] types now let's
[49:40] investigate now let's investigate we
[49:42] have run out of
[49:45] time brother went to the Book of
[49:50] Leviticus in The Book of Leviticus
[49:54] 23:36 and that is the scripture that he
[50:00] took because they were trying to Corner
[50:03] brother
[50:04] BR and they told him brother Bram you
[50:06] cannot go beyond the
[50:08] seventh and then brother Bram said this
[50:11] yes I can go beyond the
[50:13] seven and then he went straight to the
[50:15] scripture because the
[50:18] scripture because the scripture was the
[50:20] absolute of brother R and that was his
[50:24] absolute glory to
[50:27] God and today he is an
[50:30] absolute you know in our absolute is the
[50:33] same absolute that brother brandom had
[50:37] and that is the
[50:39] scripture and that's why in this
[50:42] day and so many things had come out so
[50:46] many ideas had come
[50:48] out so many things so many people just
[50:52] come out with so many things you know so
[50:54] many lines of the
[50:56] message but if all of
[50:59] this but if all of this we can take into
[51:02] the
[51:04] absolute and we would be able to see
[51:06] that that doesn't fit in the
[51:09] scripture but when we speak of this
[51:11] Eighth
[51:12] Day that is in the
[51:15] scripture glory to
[51:17] God we have something to back us up in
[51:21] the word of
[51:23] God so he went into the book of
[51:27] Leviticus Leviticus
[51:30] 23 we're just
[51:32] going you know we're just going through
[51:35] something that you already
[51:38] believe okay in the book of

[1:25:56] win we will win we are that group of
[1:26:00] people that God's put
[1:26:04] here you know there was all seven
[1:26:06] brothers of
[1:26:08] David they were there to
[1:26:11] battle even the great
[1:26:14] Saul and the B and the Bible says Saul
[1:26:17] was Head and Shoulders above big tall
[1:26:21] man
[1:26:25] but nobody went out in that
[1:26:28] field only anointed
[1:26:32] one the one anointed to
[1:26:37] win the
[1:26:39] devil made one too many
[1:26:45] challenges he gave that challenge every
[1:26:51] day but David wasn't on the scene
[1:26:55] yet David wasn't on the scene
[1:26:59] yet but one day David's coming to feed
[1:27:02] his
[1:27:04] brothers he to feed his
[1:27:08] brothers and he heard
[1:27:10] something and something stirred up
[1:27:11] inside of
[1:27:14] him what was
[1:27:18] that you're defying this
[1:27:21] Army
[1:27:25] and he was
[1:27:28] loud and he was
[1:27:32] proud and David
[1:27:34] said
[1:27:36] today I'll take your head
[1:27:40] off I will shut your
[1:27:44] mouth cuz I've been anointed to be
[1:27:48] king we've been anointed to be Kings and
[1:27:51] Priests
[1:27:54] and and Goliath was
[1:27:58] nothing but one more
[1:28:04] trial David never said the the the
[1:28:09] bear and the
[1:28:11] lion was easy or
[1:28:16] hard so he didn't say the same thing to
[1:28:21] Goliath
[1:28:23] he didn't say oh this is going to be
[1:28:26] hard no he said I already killed
[1:28:30] them how he took them out the
[1:28:33] way so this is just going to be one more
[1:28:38] battle that we're going to shut the
[1:28:40] devil
