[7:02] house of the Lord around chasing my
[7:04] hands that god bless you good to be back
[7:07] good to be with the home folk good to be
[7:14] here we are privileged people I thought
[7:27] man when brother Dale took up an
[7:29] offering that'd be the biggest often
[7:30] whatever God Terrence Terrence said it
[7:32] was a small list the smallest offering
[7:36] we ever had to pass the lucci right in
[7:39] the face I mean man come on now
[7:43] I really did I really he was kind of
[7:50] slow you know he was kind of fly through
[8:00] there you know sometimes sometimes you
[8:03] know you miss people there doing this
[8:04] but boy when you go slow and you look
[8:06] people in the face and you go that
[8:18] happened in the church the long time
[8:19] went well a while back a preacher now
[8:23] don't need that preacher did that and he
[8:27] quit going to church that's the truth
[8:31] he said a preacher ain't supposed to
[8:33] take up offering so he just quit the
[8:34] church I mean he didn't just make a
[8:36] statement he quit the church so anyway
[8:39] so whatever if you don't show up next
[8:44] Sunday we'll know
[8:47] our Wednesday finisher Wednesday then
[8:51] we'll know he got mad at Lois just get
[8:54] mad Louise don't you manage the rest
[8:56] everybody else you get mad Louise
[8:58] we're good to be here god bless y'all
[9:01] good to see you
[9:02] house full of good-looking people
[9:04] remember mother's days next Sunday and
[9:08] momma wants to remind us of something
[9:10] else for hon oh that is correct
[9:15] I'm sorry brother John called me if
[9:17] between services and your member brother
[9:20] John would and sister my sister my
[9:23] passed out today and they took her to
[9:25] one he was calling me and I guess as
[9:28] they were taking him to her to the next
[9:29] hospital but they didn't they couldn't
[9:31] stabilize her one Hospital so they were
[9:33] rushing her to another hospital so let's
[9:35] just keep remember brother John and
[9:36] sister Violet said over here that was
[9:39] with us that we sure appreciated them
[9:41] being with us well that he called from
[9:42] Virginia and said to please have the
[9:45] whole church praise so as we when we
[9:47] pray we'll just continue lifting her up
[9:51] and until find out not to find out
[9:54] what's wrong with her they'll find out
[9:55] what's right with her amen and that God
[9:58] will move on the scene and and do what
[10:01] he said he would do all right all right
[10:03] so we remember to then the fellowship
[10:05] meeting will be the next Saturday and
[10:07] also June just keeps us in you in your
[10:11] on your calendar June 16 17 and 18th
[10:13] when we're all going to the guys are
[10:16] going to late to go we got four cabins
[10:18] to accommodate 32 people so they're all
[10:22] air-conditioned we've got we can fish
[10:26] and we're gonna have some good food and
[10:29] good fellowship so just keep us in your
[10:31] prayers so also remember that so if you
[10:34] got your Bible we're going to review
[10:36] today but I want to read this one
[10:37] scripture just kind of put the bait on
[10:42] the hook because remember we're we're
[10:45] finished with the six seals and now
[10:48] we're entering into number seven and the
[10:51] Seventh Seal
[10:54] there was a
[10:56] a brother that watches in online he he
[11:00] talked to dad myself about and I hadn't
[11:04] I kind of knew that but if you'll if
[11:06] you'll watch on the Seventh Seal listen
[11:07] to brother branham he's really on all
[11:09] the other seals he's like spot on there
[11:12] when he gets to that Seventh Seal
[11:13] remember he preached it and then the
[11:15] next day he wasn't happy with it so he
[11:17] goes back to the motel room for brother
[11:20] Maguire and brother fred sauceman was
[11:23] and he redid part of the seventh seal
[11:25] because he wasn't happy with the with
[11:27] the first part of it and i think we'll
[11:29] kind of understand that as we go through
[11:31] it because remember their silence in
[11:34] heaven for the space of a half an hour
[11:35] so he said nothing's going on nothing's
[11:40] being revealed so we'll get into that
[11:42] but let's let's review the six seals
[11:44] first let's bow our heads remember
[11:47] sister Maya the Lord Jesus we thank you
[11:50] today Lord for giving us another
[11:51] opportunity to be here to stand before
[11:54] the absolute absolute greatest people
[11:58] that ever live a little face of this
[11:59] earth is the bride of Jesus Christ and
[12:03] we pray that you just bless them today
[12:04] Lord give them supernatural revelation
[12:06] or just keep us all attentative of
[12:09] what's going on father we pray that you
[12:11] would be the active participant in this
[12:13] service because if you do then somebody
[12:15] will get something out of what's being
[12:17] said Lord we pray that you just forgive
[12:20] us of our sins and our many mistakes
[12:22] that we make Lord against you Lord just
[12:25] keep us in your will be with sister my
[12:27] Lord whatever that situation is we we
[12:30] call on the Holy Spirit to go there in
[12:33] Virginia and settle that situation Lord
[12:36] and be her brother John also and and as
[12:38] he he spoke very nervously on the phone
[12:42] and and you know that's that's his love
[12:44] so Lord he's a little bit he's a little
[12:47] bit has a little bit of fear Lord we
[12:48] pray that you just take him out of that
[12:50] that you were just give him supernatural
[12:52] strength and let him see look to you
[12:54] father the author and finisher of our
[12:56] faith Lord just be with each one leading
[12:59] got us by your Holy Spirit be with
[13:00] brother Ernie Lord as we were reading
[13:03] this text a little while ago being over
[13:05] there in the Philippines Lord hadn't
[13:06] been there in a long time so we pray
[13:08] this you just give him super not
[13:10] strength and let him say Lord something
[13:12] that will help the people be with us now
[13:14] and take care of us be with the other
[13:16] missionaries on the foreign fields Lord
[13:18] give them fruit for their labor granite
[13:20] Lord we pray these things in Jesus name
[13:22] Amen
[13:23] John 19 verse 30 says when Jesus
[13:25] therefore had received the vinegar he
[13:28] said it is finished and he bowed his
[13:30] head and gave up to go you may be seated
[13:34] in Lord at his blessing to the reading
[13:35] of the word now that's not going to have
[13:38] anything to do with what we're going to
[13:39] talk about right now but that's going to
[13:41] be part of what we're going to talk
[13:43] about in this 7th seal now to just
[13:47] background a little bit on that just
[13:49] let's be careful that remember people
[13:54] have made them and we're just going to
[13:56] talk today I maintain raised my voice
[13:59] the the seventh seal has been talked
[14:06] about it's open it's not open its
[14:09] polygamy it's two strolls it's a great
[14:12] revelation that nobody knows which that
[14:14] I believe it's a revelation that they
[14:16] don't know okay if you say the seals are
[14:20] not open then you're exactly correct to
[14:23] you because you've closed them and then
[14:27] I believe the seals are open I believe
[14:28] where we're living in an open book age
[14:31] because we see revelations 10 that that
[14:34] mighty angel came down from heaven with
[14:36] a book that was open and he came down
[14:39] what to give it to us so the book is
[14:41] open John didn't need a closed book he
[14:43] eat an open book alright so that book is
[14:45] open so when you hear somebody say that
[14:49] I believe the seals are closed are not
[14:51] open yet just agree with them and then
[14:55] tell them say well maybe to you they're
[14:57] not but to me they've been open okay
[15:00] maybe it'll spark a little interest I
[15:02] don't know we'll see that we know we're
[15:04] coming to a great hour now to where to
[15:08] where we are it's gonna be just like the
[15:10] Lord you know we're gonna be almost by
[15:12] herself here toward the end the Lord
[15:15] Jesus never was popular he was the
[15:17] seventh seal still is the seventh co say
[15:19] was but him being the seventh seal he
[15:21] was a great mystery when he was
[15:23] the greatest mystery that ever stepped
[15:24] foot on the face of this earth is that
[15:26] God Almighty could be in human flesh and
[15:28] die for your sins but the great part
[15:32] that we see we are a beneficiary brother
[15:35] Branham says of that because he
[15:37] resurrected come back on the day of
[15:39] Pentecost inside to believer so that
[15:41] makes us the benefactor are the
[15:44] beneficiary of what he did so in being
[15:47] the beneficiary of what he did then I'll
[15:49] just give you a key we were talking
[15:52] downstairs just a little bit because
[15:54] brother Brown said the seals are Christ
[15:56] amen
[15:58] it is the complete book of Redemption
[16:00] and it's Christ revealed to me and you
[16:04] all right so what is one of the great
[16:07] mysteries is brother brems preach Christ
[16:10] is the mystery of God revealed so now I
[16:14] want to ask you a question where's
[16:16] Christ
[16:22] where's Christ I am think boy y'all have
[16:26] y'all have really we haven't been here a
[16:28] while so we are Christ if not then we're
[16:32] another form or we're a begotten of a
[16:34] begotten which makes us a grandchild are
[16:37] we've got a second person of a Trinity
[16:38] somewhere see how we are we can't be if
[16:41] you're if you have Christ in you then
[16:44] you are the mystery and you must be
[16:47] revealed because that's what the end
[16:49] time that's what the Seventh Seal is to
[16:51] me is the coming of the Lord but now
[16:53] it's not the coming of the Lord
[16:55] physically he doesn't come physically
[17:00] it's the coming of the Lord in you
[17:03] physically and a group of people called
[17:06] a bride so we want to keep these things
[17:09] counted in the back of their mind and
[17:10] remember to when Jesus was when Jesus
[17:13] there said it is finished now when Jesus
[17:16] said it's finished he died the body
[17:20] didn't move until Sunday morning but was
[17:25] something going on hey man there was
[17:28] something going on as soon as that body
[17:30] as soon as that soul left that body he
[17:32] went straight to hell start the
[17:33] preaching to the souls in prison going
[17:35] to paradise
[17:36] now paradise so when Jesus said it is
[17:38] finished as far as we see and as far as
[17:42] what happened on the surface of the
[17:43] earth nothing happened
[17:45] Jerusalem went right on doing the same
[17:48] thing they were doing they had their
[17:50] Passover which fell on that Sabbath that
[17:53] made it a high Sabbath that's why they
[17:54] had to get Jesus off the cross before 6
[17:57] o'clock because remember Jewish days
[17:59] begin at 6 o'clock p.m. that's why Jesus
[18:03] died on Friday before the sixth o'clock
[18:05] they had to get him off the cross and
[18:06] put him in a tomb because Saturday they
[18:08] didn't do anything that was their
[18:09] Sabbath all right but we know something
[18:13] the greatest thing that ever happened
[18:14] went on he went to hell preach to them
[18:17] locked him back up where they were he
[18:20] come up through paradise picked them up
[18:21] took them up come back down and brought
[18:25] his body out of a tomb all right so
[18:28] there was a lot went on when that
[18:29] silence in heaven for the space of half
[18:31] an hour I believe something is going on
[18:34] and then because remember God is never
[18:37] silent there's always something going on
[18:40] all right
[18:41] so just remember that when we see when
[18:43] we come to that next Sunday
[18:47] something is happening so if you will
[18:50] let's turn to revelation 6 and let's
[18:52] let's just kind of review I know what
[18:56] you know we've started this in February
[18:58] a year ago so we've been on this for a
[19:03] while and sometimes you know you lose
[19:05] we're all human beings we we lose some
[19:08] of the points so I just want to bring
[19:09] out some of the points if that's all
[19:12] right that's what I said today we'll
[19:14] just kind of we're just gonna gonna be
[19:16] vanilla and and just try to get
[19:22] everybody back on the same page because
[19:24] it's a Seventh Seal doesn't open then
[19:27] Christ doesn't come but we know that he
[19:31] says he's coming back and he's is coming
[19:33] back in the bride so we know it's open
[19:35] its open to somebody there the seals
[19:38] have been open to somebody and that's
[19:42] you know what sister Johnny you just got
[19:45] to say that's me every one of you says
[19:49] that's me
[19:50] I'm the one cuz listen we're in this
[19:54] church age right here and you're being
[19:56] in this church age right here this is
[19:59] one two three four five six seven and
[20:02] buy okay while are you doing that just
[20:06] maybe pray for sister Magan why just
[20:10] they're just so dear people good grief
[20:12] that's good people enjoyed them being
[20:14] here amen alright so now let's talk
[20:19] about this for a minute revelation six
[20:20] let's start and then when I and I saw
[20:24] when the lamb opened one of the seals
[20:25] and I heard it was the noise of thunder
[20:27] now we'll get into that a little while
[20:28] but not right now one of the four beasts
[20:30] said come and see and I sell and behold
[20:33] a white horse and he that sat on him had
[20:35] a white head bow and a crown was given
[20:37] unto him and he went forth conquering
[20:38] and to conquer now pay attention that
[20:41] these things work crown was given unto
[20:43] him and new as we see later on that he
[20:45] is given power it is a permitted power
[20:50] you and I have power when the Holy Ghost
[20:52] comes upon us that's what the Bible says
[20:54] you now have power once that the Holy
[20:57] Ghost come upon us but the devil can't
[20:59] get the Holy Ghost so he don't have any
[21:00] power the only power he has is the power
[21:03] we give him amen
[21:05] I mean that great little powerful
[21:09] scripture that says resist the devil and
[21:11] he'll flee from you that's pretty
[21:15] powerful but it's so simple just resist
[21:18] him and he'll flee from you all right so
[21:21] now remember we saw that the horse was
[21:23] white it was a white righteous church
[21:27] that came out in the in the first three
[21:29] Church ages well I got him right here so
[21:32] this is seal one two three and four this
[21:33] is the seven churches we went through
[21:35] this I'm just gonna go through it again
[21:36] then all right
[21:37] the man's okay just a little refresher
[21:39] course then we're gonna take communion
[21:41] and I hope somebody put warm water in
[21:43] that communion water who got the
[21:46] communion water thank yous I don't ever
[21:48] let 95 let's do it again
[21:51] Lord we were all up here I thought we
[21:53] got a revival which speaking in tongues
[21:55] we put her feet in that water and it was
[21:56] like 32 degrees we had to bust the ice
[21:59] to get in and I thought where did you
[22:01] get that water Oh
[22:03] anyway anyway and Robert squealed lucky
[22:09] baby whoo there you go
[22:10] hey squeal lucky I was watching his feet
[22:12] he's putting feet wet so thank God we
[22:16] got warm water today thank you brother
[22:18] Zach I appreciate that bless your heart
[22:20] you and you and brother Josiah all do a
[22:22] good job get all the good good good
[22:25] brothers brother little brother John
[22:27] back that team and I saw him beheld a
[22:29] white horse
[22:30] so this white horse remember he was a
[22:33] bluff he was a white horse so he didn't
[22:36] start out in a barroom he started out in
[22:42] a church he got in the church he got in
[22:47] the church the first church which was a
[22:50] white righteous church amen
[22:53] they had everything right they had all
[22:55] the they had all the no denomination all
[23:01] the doctrines that we hear now and then
[23:03] then all this other stuff it came from
[23:07] that wild horse rider guy that got in
[23:10] the church ages and started polluting
[23:12] everything amen
[23:14] but he did it under the auspice are
[23:17] under the power of a white righteous
[23:20] church and you know what Satan not the
[23:25] barroom today's right here so he's still
[23:27] trying to get in that white righteous
[23:28] church amen so there was a white
[23:31] righteous church that started on the day
[23:34] of Pentecost right here on the day of
[23:36] Pentecost and for the first three ages
[23:38] they had a pure word the Lion of the
[23:41] tribe of Judah the lion the lion one of
[23:48] the four beasts the first beast was
[23:51] lying not lying lion they were bold but
[23:56] now Satan also came in and he rode right
[23:59] beside that white righteous church and
[24:02] he actually got inside that white
[24:03] righteous church
[24:05] hey man because that first Street Church
[24:08] ages there was no Trinity there was no
[24:10] father son Holy Ghost baptism sure they
[24:12] were sayings those things I didn't cover
[24:14] because there you should know that
[24:16] because anything starts to the saying I
[24:19] mean I can wish for something sister
[24:21] Rebeka here by the time it gets to that
[24:23] it ain't nothing I said you ever played
[24:26] that before yeah well it won't be
[24:28] nothing because they'll have about 85
[24:31] interpretations by the time he gets back
[24:33] up to here right so that's the same way
[24:35] it was with with Satan he goes in with a
[24:38] saying but they didn't they didn't cut
[24:41] it completely off it kind of reminds me
[24:43] that when Joshua went into the Promised
[24:45] Land you know God told him he said
[24:47] destroy them all but they left a few
[24:51] that was a few of this at left and a few
[24:54] of that and they always had trouble with
[24:55] that few that they'd allowed they would
[24:57] have just killed them all they wouldn't
[24:58] have no problem with them right same way
[25:03] with demons and things that we that if
[25:04] we need to kill them if you get oh if
[25:06] they kill them they don't resurrect amen
[25:08] so we look in the first three Church
[25:11] ages that they let that thing in that
[25:13] white horse that white horse with the
[25:17] guy sitting on it which is Satan started
[25:21] riding through the church ages and then
[25:23] the first buck the end of the third
[25:24] church age about the Nicene council what
[25:28] happened it's not just a it's not just a
[25:32] saying it becomes a deed then it becomes
[25:36] a doctrine then it become incarnate into
[25:38] people all right so like brother Dale
[25:41] has been talking about you know four is
[25:43] four is not a bad number four is four is
[25:46] always the number of restoration because
[25:49] you had your line ox man and eagle so
[25:51] you had four horse riders that went out
[25:54] and you had four combat beasts to combat
[25:57] those riders all right so four it's not
[25:59] a bad number when you use it that way
[26:01] it's earthly number which is fine but
[26:04] listen if we don't have you can have
[26:06] justification st. catching baptism of
[26:08] the Holy Ghost that's fine but if you
[26:10] don't have the word incarnate you're not
[26:14] going to like a body change
[26:15] and then that's what we're heading
[26:18] toward here so we look now we see to
[26:20] that
[26:20] in Revelation six we see this white
[26:24] horse and him that sat on him had a bow
[26:27] and a crown was given unto him and he
[26:29] warn't went forth conquering and to
[26:31] conquer but also we remember on the
[26:33] flipside of all this that we saw that if
[26:37] this is the and I'm saying if for your
[26:39] for your purpose this is a book of
[26:42] redemption not a book of the devil it's
[26:48] a book of redemption it's how you and I
[26:52] come to be fully redeemed body spirit
[26:56] and soul that's what the seven seals are
[26:58] for no more no less
[27:01] all right so that's okay to learn it the
[27:04] wild horse riders the Antichrist but
[27:06] that was the seal that had the thing
[27:08] sealed if you'll remember back when I
[27:10] started this whole thing we started with
[27:12] the paper because remember that book in
[27:16] Revelations 5 is not a book that book in
[27:20] Revelation is 10 it's not a book not
[27:23] that's not a book it's not a book it's
[27:26] the scroll this is what they used to
[27:29] make books out of they make books out of
[27:31] like what we were talking about here and
[27:33] there was a seal on that that had it
[27:36] sealed well the wine horse riders the
[27:37] Anti Christ was the seal that had all
[27:40] that good stuff written down inside of
[27:42] it you can see that run but you see
[27:45] what's written in there but you can't
[27:47] make out what it says you can't read
[27:49] circles but when the seal was broke off
[27:52] in 1963 when that bit took a profit it
[27:56] took a profit from God to get the
[27:59] revelation from God to tell us that that
[28:02] seal is the Antichrist and then the seal
[28:08] went off and then this opened up so that
[28:13] you can see what's inside of it now
[28:15] everybody wants to go with the seal well
[28:18] we know the seal that's that's the seals
[28:20] the Antichrist and that's the opening of
[28:22] the seal no that's not the opening of
[28:24] the seal that's the tearing off of the
[28:26] seal the opening is what's underneath
[28:28] because that
[28:29] nothing to do with Redemption just
[28:30] knowing that the wild horse rider was
[28:32] the Antichrist part of it but not all of
[28:35] it
[28:36] what will your Redemption is is what's
[28:38] written on the inside what was
[28:40] previously not shined on if you'll
[28:42] remember the if you'll remember the
[28:46] vision that brother Branham had about
[28:48] the about the pyramid where he whipped
[28:51] the top off and he looked down in there
[28:53] now
[28:54] now look most people this is the way
[28:55] they see that vision is the brother Ram
[28:57] took the took the top off the pyramid
[29:00] and wrote something inside of it could
[29:05] they try to make him same say all kinds
[29:06] of different things but he didn't say
[29:09] that he said I looked and there was
[29:11] something written inside the pyramid
[29:13] that light had never shined on it wasn't
[29:16] that he was writing something new it was
[29:19] already in there it was just now light
[29:22] was shining on it and he could read when
[29:24] he said so that was to me that's the
[29:26] opening of the seals the opening the
[29:28] seal just to open the word up so that we
[29:30] can plainly see what it is that it's
[29:32] redemption it's your redemption in my
[29:37] Redemption we went all the way through
[29:39] six seals and we come up to the sixth
[29:41] seal and it even shows the redemption of
[29:43] the earth we discovered that the
[29:46] redemption of the earth so I want to go
[29:49] through this real slow
[29:50] that we will get it make sure that that
[29:53] we see the types because you're going to
[29:56] see a lot of times that let's think
[29:59] about this last night we were talking
[30:02] about interval last time we were we were
[30:04] speaking and you take you take a play in
[30:07] the acts of a play you got your actors
[30:08] and you've got all the things on the
[30:11] stage and then they close the curtain
[30:13] they change the scene bring out another
[30:15] scene and there's an interval in there
[30:18] and then they open the curtain back up
[30:19] same thing happened to this seal number
[30:23] one was closed they opened up the
[30:26] property God was here he pulled the
[30:27] curtain back said hey here seal number
[30:29] one
[30:29] well they had to they had to close back
[30:31] up so they could get everybody off the
[30:33] stage and get the second church age or
[30:34] get the second seal back on the stage
[30:36] because if you'll remember brother
[30:38] Branham says this is an act of a play
[30:42] an act of a play well I want to tell you
[30:45] something this is not just an act of a
[30:47] plate this is a vision that you and I
[30:50] are in brother Brown said this is not
[30:54] real he said this is really not the real
[30:59] you remember he said you know the the
[31:01] the ones he hugged over in the sixth
[31:03] dimension they're more real than we are
[31:05] so this is a part of God that we do have
[31:08] to remember there's no redemption in the
[31:14] sixth there's no redemption in the sixth
[31:17] dimension they're already redeemed
[31:21] there's no redemption in heaven
[31:24] nobody needs redemption up there there's
[31:27] definitely no redemption in hell
[31:29] so where's redemption right here
[31:31] redemption happens in these first Street
[31:33] life flattened matter this is where we
[31:35] get redeemed okay redemptions not in
[31:39] heaven redemption happens on the earth
[31:41] so that's one of the seals
[31:42] that's why brother Brown said that
[31:44] thunder sounded on the earth they sound
[31:46] here right here where we're at today
[31:48] so under this first seal we see a white
[31:51] righteous horse or a white righteous man
[31:55] riding along throwing out his doctrine
[31:58] but then we also see that we see that
[32:01] word justification now justification is
[32:04] what chopping off your past sins this
[32:06] makes you white alright so that's the
[32:11] way we typed it and we see the type of
[32:13] justification because what is
[32:15] justification a part of Redemption you
[32:18] must keep these words going right
[32:20] because that's the plan of redemption
[32:22] are the play of redemption you whichever
[32:26] one you want to call it is it's the acts
[32:28] of a play because really in God's mind
[32:30] were already redeemed really and got
[32:33] really listen the Bible's already told
[32:34] us those who he's justified he's already
[32:36] glorified so what are we in we're in
[32:39] acts of a play we got to make our
[32:41] probably got to go out and do our part
[32:43] and once we get our part done we leave
[32:47] we go into another dimension and God
[32:50] watch this plays off but we got to see
[32:53] then like brother Dale was talking about
[32:54] the other day
[32:56] justification in its baby form is that
[33:03] your check your past sins are chopped
[33:05] off now in the seals that's not true as
[33:08] so much as that because justification is
[33:11] not sure we have to ask God to forgive
[33:13] us of our sins every day right but those
[33:16] things we used to do we should not be
[33:18] telling asking God to forgive us of
[33:20] those things that we used to do all
[33:23] right we ask God to forgive us because
[33:25] of the wrong thoughts and the wrong
[33:26] things that we do as far as humanity but
[33:28] when we come to this justification
[33:30] brother Branham said it was as if you
[33:32] never done it you're heading toward a a
[33:34] part of you to see that the real you
[33:37] didn't do it to start with
[33:39] is that Alright said I don't to thrill
[33:41] your heart that order through your heart
[33:43] that we come to a place that we know
[33:46] that we know that we know that we did
[33:49] not do those things amen in other words
[33:52] that just is a vapor it just went away
[33:55] it's not in God's mind so it's not so
[34:01] what sins are you talking about somebody
[34:04] ought to write a song about then wow
[34:12] you'll get it in a minute
[34:13] some of you will okay but justified
[34:19] justified you have not done it in the
[34:21] first place justified you know the song
[34:23] there all right somebody did write one
[34:25] about them but see that's what this
[34:27] justification is this justification is
[34:29] not chopping off your big your big sins
[34:32] it's it's it's a continuation of going
[34:35] on that God is what God is not telling
[34:39] you you're going to be redeemed he's
[34:44] telling you you already are redeemed
[34:47] okay this justification is telling you
[34:50] now the first baby form justification
[34:53] remember you get justified and you still
[34:55] have that old man inside of you that
[34:57] made you do that that's why
[34:59] justification is not the new birth
[35:02] justification is part of salvation and
[35:07] if you were to die suddenly like the
[35:09] people in the cross
[35:09] different things God could not judge you
[35:12] for any of your past sins because you
[35:14] don't have any hey you don't have any
[35:18] amen
[35:22] but that's under baby form justification
[35:25] because the person in there that did it
[35:27] is still there that old nature that all
[35:30] fallen nature is still attached to you
[35:33] making you do the things you used to do
[35:35] now that's still a journey as brother
[35:40] Dale's preaching I'm glad he's bringing
[35:42] this in because it helps us all to see
[35:45] where we are wewe got to know where we
[35:47] are take a refresher course you know
[35:49] just like now we're taking a refresher
[35:50] course of our salvation and then you can
[35:54] be able to say Amen or owe me one of the
[35:56] two I hope y'all say Amen but some are
[36:00] gonna say Oh me and that's okay that you
[36:03] say Oh me because to realize that you
[36:05] need more and that's all of our job is
[36:08] to make you realize you need more okay
[36:11] you need more of God so this
[36:13] justification is as if you never done it
[36:15] it's not that God's gonna chop your past
[36:18] sins or he's already done that this is
[36:21] coming to a realization that hey men I'm
[36:24] maturing I am justified I got trapped
[36:31] into it I'm living a Christian life when
[36:35] you come to this part of justification
[36:36] in the see on the first seal look you
[36:39] make Satan powerless you make him
[36:44] powerless you do the only power he gets
[36:49] this win like brother Gary action says
[36:51] we give him a bunch of arrows he how can
[36:53] you hunt with it just a bowl you can't
[36:55] kill nothing but time yeah trying to go
[37:01] bear hunting with just a bow you'll
[37:04] realize real quick it will become a
[37:06] revelation as that brother said that you
[37:08] got the wrong equipment real quick so
[37:12] that's the same way with Satan he's got
[37:14] the wrong equipment but we think he's
[37:16] this great some big something that we
[37:17] can't overcome well I believe the first
[37:19] seal opening tells us shows us that
[37:21] we're justify
[37:23] in God not in that and God were
[37:26] justified and the real and the real
[37:29] person is coming to a realization that
[37:32] they didn't do it to start with
[37:33] amen because you can't blame what you
[37:37] did in your past life on the new birth
[37:40] you can't play
[37:42] you can't blame what you did on what you
[37:44] got now that's why I believe in you let
[37:48] me say that again brother Colley yeah
[37:50] he's he's like what you can't fly I
[37:53] can't say it again I forgot but you
[37:55] can't say that that you know everybody
[37:58] says the devil made me do it no you you
[38:00] did it
[38:01] he just helped you do it cuz if it was
[38:06] that easy we just send the devil to hell
[38:07] with I'll go to heaven no you got
[38:10] something to do with it you do alright
[38:13] you give him the arrows to shoot you
[38:16] with a with a bow when if you didn't
[38:19] give him any arrows he couldn't shoot
[38:20] you but that part of justification is
[38:23] not the baby foreign part that God
[38:25] forgive me of my sins I'm a sinner save
[38:27] me now that's that's not that
[38:30] justification that justification like I
[38:32] said is bringing you to a position to
[38:34] tell you that that one inside of you
[38:37] never did it because that was not in you
[38:39] when you did it that's why I do not
[38:41] agree with the people in the message
[38:42] that says you always was eternal you had
[38:44] eternal life in your soul not when I was
[38:46] doing the things I did hello
[38:51] you tell me you look back through your
[38:53] life at the things you did you think God
[38:55] was in you know the reason he's in me
[38:58] now is why I don't do them things no
[39:00] more amen
[39:02] that's why I believe it is just a
[39:04] justification now why would brother
[39:06] Branham if brother Branham since there's
[39:07] nothing it bothers me they say brother
[39:11] branch they say they say brother I'm
[39:13] taught that you always was eternal and
[39:15] you never needed eternal life and but
[39:17] now why would he make a statement that
[39:19] at 12 years old I would have got saved
[39:22] had it not been for that demon well if
[39:26] he always was eternal what was a demon
[39:29] have to do with it
[39:30] no brother Branham will tell you a story
[39:33] how he used to wash his car on Sunday
[39:36] not go to church before he got born
[39:39] again a prophet on Sunday washing his
[39:43] car watching people go to church no he
[39:47] might have been a prophet but he didn't
[39:49] have the new birth he had a new birth
[39:52] you've been in church amen
[39:54] so that's just to me that's just that's
[39:55] what the that's what the great mystery
[39:57] of this whole thing is is that brother
[40:00] Branham never changed the Bible he
[40:03] cannot change the Bible he cannot change
[40:06] the way that we're saved he cannot
[40:07] change the way that that we not gonna
[40:11] get a new body like new throw this one
[40:13] away and pick up another one we're not
[40:15] gonna do that it's gonna be this body
[40:16] redeemed amen everybody understand that
[40:20] that's another easy thing you'd be real
[40:23] easy to throw this one away and just God
[40:25] make you a brand new one no the hard
[40:28] part is to get this thing changed this
[40:30] thing that was born in sin see that's
[40:33] why we go by and we think well this
[40:34] thing was born in sin is justified
[40:39] justified I have not done it in the
[40:43] first place if you realize that then you
[40:44] got to take this guy with it this is
[40:46] what's going to change this body is for
[40:48] us to realize that that work of the
[40:51] change that the body is already in us
[40:54] it's not somewhere and it's not
[40:56] something some preachers gonna lay hands
[40:58] on you to get a body change it's inside
[41:01] you right now everything you needs
[41:05] inside of you
[41:06] amen all right so there we go
[41:09] justification we come to a place to see
[41:11] that that white horse is not riding in
[41:14] our life anymore he's riding away he's
[41:18] riding off he's taking a trip away from
[41:21] us and don't let it be like a boomerang
[41:26] okay stop it let him just keep on going
[41:28] brother Branham says that horse just
[41:30] rides right on into eternity I want him
[41:32] to ride so far away from me till I never
[41:34] see him again
[41:35] amen so there we go with with seal
[41:39] number one we see it's the first three
[41:41] church ages it was the Lion of the tribe
[41:43] of Judah went forth with the boldness of
[41:46] preaching the gospel Peter said silver
[41:48] and gold have I none but such
[41:50] I have give unto thee rise up and walk
[41:54] that was that first three ages but by
[41:55] the time we get to the fourth age every
[41:58] bit of that just goes away all right
[42:01] because that horse somebody listened to
[42:05] what that saying was and made it a deed
[42:07] all right so let's go to Revelation six
[42:11] first three and four when he had opened
[42:14] the second seal I heard the second beast
[42:16] say come and see and they went out
[42:17] another horse that was red so this is a
[42:19] this is another powered same rider but
[42:22] another power another angle Satan has to
[42:25] get to you all right cuz let these seals
[42:29] are for you you say oh no that happened
[42:34] back there for you and they went out
[42:39] another horse that was red and power was
[42:40] given to him that sat thereon to take
[42:42] peace sea power was given to take peace
[42:44] from the earth they should kill one
[42:45] another and there was given unto him a
[42:47] great sword we know what a sword is it's
[42:49] a word all right so that was a word
[42:52] given unto him what at Nicaea to change
[42:55] everything over to what we see now and
[42:57] set up start setting up denominations
[42:59] all right there by okay with that say
[43:01] Amen all right so this is a red horse
[43:03] rider now what is always red signifies
[43:07] sanctification red through red is white
[43:10] all right everybody with that say ma'am
[43:12] punch your neighbor come and chalk the
[43:17] gate punch your neighbor when y'all say
[43:20] Amen do this that way everybody stay
[43:22] away
[43:25] don't Amen up like this ain't man like
[43:27] this we'll see who's got brotherly
[43:30] kindness I'm up here by myself I'm fine
[43:36] y'all just don't start beating on each
[43:38] other so that's the red horse rider now
[43:42] we see that what brother Brown told us
[43:44] is that remember that was starting in
[43:48] and remember what we said all this is
[43:50] these are all lap overs you see how I've
[43:52] got them kind of straight they're all
[43:54] lapped over there's one lapping over to
[43:57] the other all right because what
[43:59] happened was they should kill one
[44:01] another what was the
[44:02] the worst killing was was the word they
[44:06] killed the people's influence and they
[44:09] physically killed 68 million Christians
[44:12] starting into this time as that red
[44:15] horse rider brother Brown said that
[44:16] horse rode through the blood of the
[44:18] martyrs of the saints of God all right
[44:21] thereby okay with that
[44:22] and that was the Ox age which was the
[44:26] labor there was not a lot of exciting
[44:28] thing goes on with an ox but that Joker
[44:31] if you want him to pull something he
[44:33] just you just put a little something out
[44:34] in front of him he just keeps pulling
[44:35] and he pulled him right through that
[44:37] longest church age which is between
[44:40] three four and five that's fifteen
[44:41] hundred years of dark ages and we see
[44:45] it's Church age number four and that
[44:48] shows to me that shows sanctification
[44:50] not the sanctification that you're
[44:53] cleaned and set aside for service that
[44:56] was the baby form sanctification God
[44:58] cleans the jar up and then puts you to
[45:03] where you can be filled and he can put
[45:06] you in service that all right say ma'am
[45:08] now this sanctification he's not gonna
[45:10] put you back down in the mud and bring
[45:12] you back out again no he's got a higher
[45:14] order for you he's got a higher position
[45:16] the statue of a perfect man he wants to
[45:19] now clean you up so much to micro clean
[45:22] you clean all the my even down to the
[45:26] molecules he wants to just steam clean
[45:29] you hey man not the inside guy now we're
[45:34] talking about the memories and
[45:35] conscience of the spirit realm of the
[45:37] man because you're born again inside
[45:39] yourself you're born again you don't
[45:41] need to be sanctified in that interim
[45:43] interim in there man he's already
[45:46] sanctified
[45:47] he's already took a rapture really okay
[45:50] you understand what I'm saying so we're
[45:52] working on the middleman the memory
[45:54] reason conscious affects an imagination
[45:55] that's what we're working on and God's
[45:58] gonna start cleaning that up he's gonna
[46:00] start cleaning us up by what red blood
[46:08] the bleeding Word of God amen
[46:12] the bleeding Word of God every Sunday
[46:16] we get a dose of the bleeding Word of
[46:19] God and it should wash us out I'm in
[46:23] that all right it washes it it keeps us
[46:27] clean he doesn't clean us up the first
[46:31] time we've already had that we've
[46:33] already got the new birth in our soul
[46:34] it's cleaning up that memory reason
[46:37] conscious affection imagination is
[46:39] putting there what setting our
[46:40] affections toward God set in our place
[46:43] to where God can I told him this morning
[46:46] in Bible School in Bible School Bible
[46:48] study or son school class God's not
[46:50] going to take some a child a Christian
[46:55] child it's not going to take the body
[46:57] change they don't know how it's like
[47:01] driving a car a kids the kids a kid but
[47:03] don't give a five-year-old kid a car hey
[47:06] man that person has to be mature because
[47:08] we read in Hebrews where Paul told us
[47:11] said you can drink milk but you're a
[47:14] baby but you desire these other things
[47:18] you want the meat what so that we're
[47:20] given to a mature group of people and
[47:23] that's what you were trying to be as
[47:24] more mature group of people not a
[47:26] babbling Pentecostal baby that was okay
[47:30] at one time that was fine that's your
[47:33] journey here we go through our journey
[47:34] this is a journey that you might say oh
[47:37] well that's back in the church ages no
[47:39] this is this is the compartments of you
[47:43] do you read these church ages at history
[47:47] that's church age book if you read about
[47:50] the fees in church age you said well
[47:53] that was a good church anything you toss
[47:54] it over to the side no there's no gets
[47:56] in that church age book that come from
[47:58] the ephesian church age that pertains to
[48:00] you because we're at the end we're at
[48:04] the end that we can look back in like
[48:06] well they'll said we get we get every
[48:09] promise we get every over coming from
[48:13] all church ages back you and I do every
[48:17] one of them that's what you and I get so
[48:20] thank God for that mmm we're in the end
[48:23] time folks the books open
[48:28] and God wants to give it to us more than
[48:30] we want it amen
[48:33] all right so now let's go to the next
[48:35] one revelation 6 verse 5 and when he had
[48:45] opened the third seal I heard the third
[48:47] beast say come and see and I beheld in
[48:49] law a black horse and he that sat on him
[48:51] had a pair of balances in his hand and
[48:53] heard a voice in the midst of the four
[48:55] beasts say a measure of wheat wheat for
[48:58] a penny and three measures of barley for
[48:59] a penny see that not hurt the oil and
[49:03] the wine and what is the oil the oil is
[49:06] the Holy Ghost and the wine is the
[49:08] stimulation of Revelation as brother
[49:10] Dale was saying this morning listen you
[49:13] cannot get a revelation from God without
[49:15] the Holy Ghost now you can get a
[49:19] knowledge that will take you to a place
[49:22] to get born again like you heard my
[49:27] testimony not too long ago I read I read
[49:29] all the books and I listened to tapes
[49:31] that's 14 years old well you know what I
[49:33] got a stimulation from that but and it
[49:37] stayed in there in my in my gray matter
[49:40] it stayed there because it was part of
[49:41] my memory but folks it didn't help me
[49:45] for the next 20 years there was an
[49:48] interval in there between me and God
[49:51] that I'm very ashamed of a man and God
[49:55] didn't have they went nothing he could
[49:57] have poured all that word inside of me
[49:58] and it would have done me no good why
[50:00] because he wasn't inside of me people
[50:04] think just because we know that that
[50:07] you're not supposed to cut your hair
[50:08] that's in the Bible brother Graham said
[50:09] that's just the ability to read ways
[50:12] that that's just the ability to be able
[50:14] to read you can read and see where it
[50:16] says the woman shouldn't go there but
[50:19] you know what there is a revelation
[50:21] behind that amen because your head ships
[50:25] Christ we all all of us shouldn't be
[50:29] cutting their hair you understand what I
[50:31] mean in the spiritual aspect because we
[50:33] are finishing the body of Christ and man
[50:36] our hair is our covering we're not
[50:39] supposed to cut ourselves off from God
[50:41] as men because we are finishing the body
[50:43] of Christ is that okay I know it must be
[50:47] boring all to death because most of you
[50:48] are asleep I tell you you sleep through
[50:53] this if you won't do but one day you're
[50:56] gonna thank brother daily myself and
[50:57] these ministers for bringing you the
[50:59] truth because you won't hear this
[51:06] everywhere ain't bragging on nobody and
[51:10] bragging on God because you know what
[51:12] there's somebody in here has to be
[51:15] getting it because God's not gonna stand
[51:17] up here and preach through all of us and
[51:19] y'all don't get anything somebody's
[51:22] gonna get something if it's just one of
[51:24] you but I just like to think all of us
[51:26] are maybe you're just praying in silent
[51:29] when you got your eyes closed hmm it's
[51:37] rough as we get older you know it just
[51:40] really is revelation 6 verse 5 and we
[51:43] had opened the third seal we go to the
[51:44] third seal the third beat says come and
[51:46] see now who was the third beast the
[51:48] third beast was the man so we've had to
[51:51] line I what you laughing about Louie's
[51:53] line Hawks man don't fall out when you
[51:56] go to sleep don't follow you'll hurt
[51:57] what to pray for you praying for me
[51:59] okay all right thank you all right just
[52:03] don't fall out that bench try that
[52:06] sometime get up on the front of this
[52:08] thing and you'll you'll you'll not go to
[52:10] sleep because you'll you know if you go
[52:12] to sleep you go fall off in the floor
[52:18] what was I saying oh the man lie knocks
[52:21] man an eagle now the man is the
[52:23] intelligence now we must get this cuz
[52:26] you guys see the pattern you say well
[52:28] what is in the world has black got to do
[52:31] with the Holy Ghost that was one of the
[52:33] questions even when brother Dale was
[52:34] preaching them back in the 80s I'm like
[52:36] my dentist what in the world but inside
[52:41] of you is death if you're not born again
[52:48] but that old nature inside the you has
[52:51] got to die before Christ can come in
[52:54] amen
[52:55] because you can't have a live devil and
[52:58] the live holy ghost in your soul at the
[52:59] same time one of them's got to be dead
[53:02] just like you know what just like we go
[53:04] back to the Bible you're not supposed to
[53:06] have a one wife you're not supposed to
[53:07] have the one husband we'll go back to we
[53:09] covered it under here under marriage and
[53:12] divorce you can't be married to three or
[53:13] four people and be married to Christ
[53:15] your old husband can be dead though and
[53:18] you can marry Christ so you're our old
[53:21] husband Satan has been killed and he's
[53:24] dead but remember we see this as the
[53:27] black horse but now look watch this just
[53:32] a minute and we read that for some of
[53:34] you that wasn't here when I was going
[53:36] through it we looked at the Bible says
[53:38] Jesus said to him one day said if that
[53:42] light in you be darkness how great is
[53:45] that darkness okay so how great is the
[53:49] darkness because right here this is this
[53:51] is the age when all denominations come
[53:55] into fruition all denominations
[53:57] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian all
[53:59] denominations became active during
[54:03] coming in from Luther to Wesley's time
[54:05] and into Pentecost and into our age
[54:08] you're looking at the most horrible time
[54:11] because God didn't ever set up a
[54:13] denomination God didn't baptize people
[54:16] in the name of Father Son Holy Ghost man
[54:17] did but god winks at their ignorance but
[54:20] it was a black-tie garden it was just
[54:22] squeezing the light out of everything
[54:24] all right even Wesley and Luther and
[54:28] then they they baptize wrong
[54:31] they had wrong doctrine but God winked
[54:34] at their ignorance but that was the
[54:36] black horse riding through those ages
[54:39] under the man anointing because if you
[54:42] know what if your man's anointing is
[54:44] intelligence now it's okay if this this
[54:47] to me this is not the intelligence of
[54:50] man this is the intelligence of man this
[54:54] is the intelligence of the Holy Ghost
[54:55] because the lion ox man an eagle is the
[54:57] Holy Ghost that anoints you
[54:59] today right now to use your intelligence
[55:03] that are not asleep everybody stand up
[55:11] shake your brother's hands they god
[55:13] bless you if they're still asleep we
[55:14] need to pray for them oh oh all right
[55:22] sit back down wait a minute all right
[55:28] stand back up just shake around a little
[55:35] bit there we go we good all right so
[55:37] then maybe we can do it while you're
[55:40] standing that's a good idea everybody
[55:44] standing will finish this sermon for
[55:46] about an hour we'll fight we'll hear
[55:49] people hit the floor like you wouldn't
[55:51] believe
[55:52] knock a whole row of people over but we
[55:57] need opened the third seal I heard the
[55:58] third beast say come and see now see
[56:00] that was the seal that was tore off
[56:02] everybody got that the seal that was
[56:04] tore off was the black horse but
[56:05] underneath that is a revelation that
[56:07] means you've got to have so I have to
[56:09] look and see that the blackness of way
[56:11] down in my memory reason conscience
[56:15] affects an imagination we all got them
[56:17] demons we got to fight you're not
[56:19] fighting one inside if you're fighting
[56:21] one inside you need a new birth okay but
[56:25] you see here this is this is not the
[56:27] Holy Ghost to give you the new birth
[56:30] this is a Holy Ghost that keeps you and
[56:33] keeps you clean it keeps anointing you
[56:35] it keeps cleaning you out it keeps
[56:37] brother branham said right here look at
[56:40] this this is the Holy Spirit and he said
[56:42] there's lines running down that moles
[56:45] all this together this is not when you
[56:46] get the Holy Ghost this is when you get
[56:48] the holy go but you work through all
[56:51] these things so that the Holy Spirit can
[56:53] what seal that person in hey man we want
[56:56] to be sealed in so much that Satan's
[56:58] sealed out mmm
[57:00] so that Holy Ghost is not just the Holy
[57:04] Ghost to get you saved to get you
[57:06] born-again that's the Holy Ghost to keep
[57:08] you going on and on and on and on more
[57:11] and more
[57:12] what being born again we read that
[57:14] scripture there and Peter being born
[57:17] again you say again I'm just reading
[57:19] what the Bible says being born again
[57:21] everything we do is a continual like I
[57:25] said sanctification they just you don't
[57:27] get washed one time you're stink
[57:32] literally but we have taken about half
[57:36] we have to get washed every Wednesday
[57:38] never Sunday
[57:39] hey man who get washed every Wednesday
[57:41] never signing by the water of the word
[57:44] and it's not bad to take one in between
[57:47] all that with regular water make sure
[57:51] it's warm mmm so anyway we're just all
[57:57] family here but don't ever do that again
[58:00] amen yeah well it was it walked up here
[58:08] who was it said somebody if somebody
[58:10] made sure you didn't get the water this
[58:12] time okay thanks for your help though I
[58:15] appreciate you helping one of these
[58:16] other brothers weren't here but don't
[58:17] ever do it again find somebody else
[58:25] that's a that's a knowledge of man that
[58:28] will he he's not gonna do that again but
[58:32] we see that what's God doing though he's
[58:34] taking you and he's taking you and he's
[58:36] zeroing you out I like what brother
[58:38] Harris said he said he zeros you out
[58:41] you're zeroed out in other words you're
[58:42] dead if you're dead but Paul says we are
[58:47] dead and our life is hidding Christ amen
[58:51] because if any part of us is alive
[58:54] remember the statement I always say God
[58:56] will fill those who are not full of
[58:58] their self amen because if you're full
[59:02] of yourself there's no place for God to
[59:04] be a man but if you limp to yourself out
[59:07] then I promise you got to fill you up
[59:09] amen
[59:10] so let's just keep on going listen we're
[59:12] the eleventh hour work or all these
[59:14] things that are being packed into us but
[59:17] you know what we're the astronaut we're
[59:19] able to receive this pressure we're able
[59:22] to receive this word that God's bringing
[59:24] us
[59:25] and then I just believe that I mean the
[59:30] things we discuss and talk about man
[59:32] it's just supernatural okay I just
[59:36] believe it is that we're brother Brown
[59:38] said we're at what a prophetic people a
[59:40] supernatural people we have supernatural
[59:42] insight why because we're reading things
[59:45] that man has read this for you for
[59:47] hundreds of years and said well you know
[59:50] what brother Branham even preached a
[59:51] wild horse rider being the holy go but
[59:54] when the seal was broke brother Ram
[59:57] didn't see Christ he saw Satan Superman
[59:59] at first with the seat that was the seal
[1:00:02] but once that seal was tore off he had
[1:00:05] to see Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ
[1:00:07] or the speedy is the seal and then Jesus
[1:00:10] Christ being in you within your journey
[1:00:12] is the Holy Ghost what living in your
[1:00:15] life it is the Holy Ghost in you doing
[1:00:18] the work not you doing the work Amen so
[1:00:21] now let's go to revelations six verse
[1:00:24] seven and eight excuse me and when he
[1:00:28] had opened the fourth seal I heard the
[1:00:30] voice of the fourth beast say come and
[1:00:32] see
[1:00:32] and I look to be able to pale horse and
[1:00:34] his name that sat on him was death and
[1:00:35] hell followed with him and the power was
[1:00:37] given unto them over the fourth part of
[1:00:39] the earth to kill with sword and with
[1:00:41] hunger and with death and with the
[1:00:43] beasts of the earth so this is a mixed
[1:00:45] color animal this is one two and three
[1:00:48] mixed together to make four white red
[1:00:53] black mixed together to make a pale
[1:00:57] horse color or a mixed color brother
[1:01:00] Brown said a horrible putrid color
[1:01:02] alright but what it is it's the power of
[1:01:05] Satan all mixed together well that's
[1:01:07] what it's coming - it's coming to a head
[1:01:09] because after this fourth seal we take a
[1:01:13] rapture we take a rapture rapture takes
[1:01:16] place on the fourth seal we explain that
[1:01:18] all right
[1:01:19] so it's a mixed color what do you see
[1:01:22] now look at all these doctrines it's all
[1:01:24] mixed like brother nails preaching not
[1:01:27] being mixed with faith we read this and
[1:01:29] Hebrews this morning downstairs they
[1:01:31] heard the word but not being mixed with
[1:01:34] faith you and I have got a number one
[1:01:36] realize who we are
[1:01:38] what church age were in what what
[1:01:41] promises we get what overcoming we get
[1:01:44] we the books open folks that you can see
[1:01:49] all these things you're privileged to be
[1:01:52] able to see this because what it's the
[1:01:54] eagle anointing it's the one that's the
[1:01:57] highest up it's the one that doesn't
[1:01:59] start drinking milk an eagle starts
[1:02:02] eating meat he never drinks milk momma
[1:02:07] Eagle goes and gets the squirrel chews
[1:02:10] it up into little bitty nuggets and
[1:02:13] gives it to the animal Eagle never
[1:02:16] drinks milk there's no milk glands
[1:02:18] afraid to drink milk with it's a
[1:02:20] meat-eater
[1:02:21] and that's what you and I are were meat
[1:02:24] eaters
[1:02:24] we love the meat of the word so this is
[1:02:27] church age number seven which now look
[1:02:30] at the way it's not just it's not just
[1:02:33] the Holy Ghost
[1:02:34] it's Incarnate Word it's the word being
[1:02:38] made flesh as we were talking many times
[1:02:40] before and the word was made flesh your
[1:02:44] flesh you will we will in the body
[1:02:48] change become the Incarnate Word but
[1:02:52] it's got to start to develop
[1:02:55] it's got to start somewhere to develop
[1:02:58] into someone is going to just walk right
[1:03:00] in to a body change and become the
[1:03:04] Incarnate Word and then the dead in
[1:03:07] crisis is going to be the Incarnate Word
[1:03:08] they're coming back here to be what God
[1:03:11] in human flesh pretty simple but this is
[1:03:17] the eagle age and when we get to the
[1:03:19] fifth seal you don't see the line ox man
[1:03:22] an eagle you don't see any of the beasts
[1:03:25] because why because we take a rapture in
[1:03:28] the seventh church age are the four
[1:03:31] seals everybody got that say man all
[1:03:33] right we've not been through this so I
[1:03:34] just wanted to I just want to refresh
[1:03:36] your memory whatever memory y'all got
[1:03:38] left after you fall asleep but the
[1:03:42] fourth seal the rapture takes place then
[1:03:44] what does God do he starts dealing with
[1:03:47] Israel okay the Holy Ghost goes to two
[1:03:50] prophets two
[1:03:52] is real and they get the baptism of the
[1:03:55] Holy Ghost 144,000 of them through two
[1:03:58] prophets their buddy got that say man
[1:03:59] all right but now we got to cover let's
[1:04:02] go to revelations 6 verse 9 and when he
[1:04:06] had opened the fifth seal immediately it
[1:04:09] goes into another dimension right
[1:04:12] because the lion ox man an eagle is your
[1:04:15] Holy Ghost in this dimension amen
[1:04:21] it's the Holy Ghost in this dimension
[1:04:24] that's gonna take us out of this
[1:04:25] dimension into another dimension then
[1:04:28] God's gonna start dealing with the Jews
[1:04:31] we're over in another dimension and then
[1:04:34] we're at the wedding supper whatever
[1:04:36] we're going to do we're in another
[1:04:37] dimension while God comes and deals with
[1:04:41] the Jews but now we see it when he had
[1:04:43] opened the fifth seal I saw under the
[1:04:44] altar the souls of them that were slain
[1:04:46] no beasts no beasts saying come and see
[1:04:49] in other words no Holy Ghost on the
[1:04:51] earth when we leave this place there's
[1:04:54] gonna be no Holy Ghost except in two
[1:04:56] prophets all seven billion people
[1:04:59] there's going to be two people within
[1:05:00] your birth two people it's gonna have
[1:05:02] the holy other then they're gonna preach
[1:05:04] and it's going to bring 144,000 then but
[1:05:06] what a dark time that's why you see that
[1:05:08] black come up and then you see the mixed
[1:05:11] color of all that together but it's
[1:05:14] going to take what not the mixing of God
[1:05:17] to get us out of here but it's going to
[1:05:19] take justification and sanctification
[1:05:21] baptism the Holy Ghost Incarnate Word to
[1:05:23] get us out of here that's what's going
[1:05:25] to get us out of here all right and
[1:05:27] we're heading toward that I know we are
[1:05:29] we're getting really close and the older
[1:05:33] ones say man the younger ones are like
[1:05:35] what are they talking about brother
[1:05:37] Donnie amens the loudest every bit of
[1:05:39] that he's heading toward one of the
[1:05:41] oldest ones in the group so I guess this
[1:05:43] was helping him out that's all right so
[1:05:47] it Abraham was not in that and when he
[1:05:50] had opened the fifth seal I saw under so
[1:05:52] altar the souls of them that were slain
[1:05:53] for the word of God and for the
[1:05:55] testimony which they held not the
[1:05:57] testimony of Jesus Christ everybody
[1:05:59] remember that all right and they cried
[1:06:01] with a loud voice and said how long O
[1:06:03] Lord holy and true dust down
[1:06:05] judge and avenge our blood now brother
[1:06:07] Brahim said that couldn't be the bride
[1:06:08] cuz see many people even brother branham
[1:06:11] thought that was the souls under the
[1:06:12] altar that were the early church are
[1:06:15] part of the church ages when that seal
[1:06:18] come off
[1:06:19] hey brother branham could read and that
[1:06:21] angel said read that again I mean I just
[1:06:25] believe the angel because remember the
[1:06:27] angel that come to brother Brian every
[1:06:29] day never gave him a revelation it was
[1:06:33] that angel pointing him to a scripture
[1:06:36] and quoting him scripture that brother
[1:06:39] Branham had to take through the filter
[1:06:41] of the Holy Ghost that was inside of him
[1:06:43] to get that revelation to bring it back
[1:06:45] out to me and you and man an angel can't
[1:06:48] give you a revelation only God can give
[1:06:50] you a revelation hey man but the angel
[1:06:54] would say hey read that again avenge
[1:06:58] testimony they held who are these people
[1:07:01] brother Graham said they can only be
[1:07:03] Jews that we're blinded so that you and
[1:07:07] I could come in because look how long
[1:07:09] will Lord hole intrude us they're not
[1:07:11] judge and avenge our blood on them that
[1:07:12] dwell on the earth now that brother
[1:07:15] brown said if that was a Christian you
[1:07:16] don't do that listen there is no one in
[1:07:20] the sixth dimension I don't care if they
[1:07:21] got murdered there's no one in the sixth
[1:07:24] dimension saying I'll be glad when I get
[1:07:28] back into that next dimension I'll take
[1:07:30] care of my boss or whoever that was no
[1:07:32] that's the dirt that's the farthest
[1:07:34] thing from their mind hey man that's the
[1:07:36] furthest thing but these people still
[1:07:37] have it in their mind that they were
[1:07:39] done wrong they were wrong Oh Lord holy
[1:07:43] and true dost thou not judge and avenge
[1:07:44] our blood on them that dwell on the
[1:07:46] earth and white robes were given unto
[1:07:48] every one of them
[1:07:49] now why is a white robe white robes
[1:07:51] eternal life amen white robes were given
[1:07:55] unto every one of them and it was said
[1:07:57] unto them that they should rest yet for
[1:07:58] a little season until their
[1:08:00] fellow-servants which is who the Jews
[1:08:03] also and their brethren the 144,000 that
[1:08:08] should be killed as they were should be
[1:08:10] fulfilled now how were they killed they
[1:08:12] were killed under persecution of the
[1:08:14] Jews right
[1:08:18] 144,000 is going to be killed under the
[1:08:20] persecution of the Jews the sixth seal
[1:08:21] persecution of the sixth seal that's
[1:08:23] what's going to kill those Jews hey man
[1:08:29] this is probably the worst response of
[1:08:33] God so I think I'll just we might stop
[1:08:37] and take communion I don't know what's
[1:08:39] wrong with y'all this sorry excites you
[1:08:40] this sort of mate cuz this and
[1:08:42] something's how about you I'm not
[1:08:43] talking about Jews I'm not I'm sure you
[1:08:45] have to use them as the allegory but my
[1:08:47] heavens people this is our Redemption
[1:08:49] this is what we're going home on we're
[1:08:51] not going home on the brother branham
[1:08:53] sent a prophet we're gonna go home is
[1:08:56] that what he said is now becoming live
[1:08:58] in our heart and we become what he said
[1:09:03] so these are Jews but look at this you
[1:09:06] talk about grace you talk about grace
[1:09:10] now see we got to bring the fifth seal
[1:09:12] 260 on the seventh seal back here
[1:09:14] everybody okay with that because
[1:09:15] remember we're gone the fifth seal is to
[1:09:18] the Jews but you and I have to get the
[1:09:21] the Thunder this under that sealed the
[1:09:24] Thunder under that seal is God is giving
[1:09:26] eternal life to a group of people that
[1:09:30] didn't even know who he was that
[1:09:32] literally turned him down and said let
[1:09:35] his blood be on us and our children and
[1:09:38] God gives them eternal life because he
[1:09:41] literally blinded their eyes so that you
[1:09:44] and I could come in hey man so what
[1:09:46] about this is the you think of how many
[1:09:48] times when you read that fifth seal
[1:09:50] think of look at how many times brother
[1:09:52] brown says grace grace grace the
[1:09:55] greatest grace sealed well what's the
[1:09:56] greatest grace to me and you is it God's
[1:09:59] changed your buddy God give you eternal
[1:10:01] life you did you want it all once we
[1:10:05] started no remember brother Brown said
[1:10:08] you didn't go searching for God God went
[1:10:10] searching for you amen so what about
[1:10:13] great so that form this is we come back
[1:10:15] to that justification under the fifth
[1:10:17] seal the real you didn't do it you've
[1:10:19] got to realize that that thing that's
[1:10:21] inside of you today
[1:10:22] never send today in this life never had
[1:10:26] a bad thought
[1:10:30] so the real you didn't do it and we must
[1:10:35] see that under this fifth seal that
[1:10:37] justification is that it's already took
[1:10:39] us to the glorified body because
[1:10:42] remembers remember we talked before if
[1:10:45] the rapture takes place here somewhere
[1:10:46] in here we got to get a glorified body
[1:10:48] you can't go in the rapture without a
[1:10:50] glorified body hey man so you got to
[1:10:53] have had one back here somewhere so
[1:10:54] under the fifth sixth and seventh seal
[1:10:56] we remember the seven seals is coming
[1:10:58] we'll talk about that later but the
[1:11:00] fifth seal shows us that we're already
[1:11:04] redeemed already redeemed we just got to
[1:11:09] believe that and then and walk into it
[1:11:12] all right let's go
[1:11:14] revelation 6 verse 12 to the sixth sixth
[1:11:17] seal we were just finished with that so
[1:11:19] we don't spend too much time I'll be all
[1:11:21] wind open the sixth seal and lo there
[1:11:22] was a great earthquake remember this is
[1:11:24] a total disruption of nature look
[1:11:26] everything this is nature Sun became
[1:11:28] black moon became blood stars of heaven
[1:11:31] fell fig trees casted in time untimely
[1:11:33] fruit mighty wind heaven departed Melton
[1:11:37] and island-y we're talking about nature
[1:11:40] all right and that's the last thing that
[1:11:42] you're not listening the last thing it's
[1:11:44] you and I let's keeping us from being
[1:11:45] taking the body change is our memory
[1:11:49] reason conscious affection imagination
[1:11:52] because that's what the whole paradox is
[1:11:54] it's that thing inside of you is trying
[1:11:57] to tell you that you're already there
[1:12:00] that thing inside of you
[1:12:07] is trying to tell you you already been
[1:12:10] redeemed you already been glorified you
[1:12:12] just got to get then what happens is is
[1:12:14] God's down here working out through that
[1:12:16] filter of memory reasoning conscious
[1:12:18] affection imagination Satan's out here
[1:12:20] working back to it this way trying to
[1:12:23] get back in through your memories and
[1:12:24] conscience fiction imagination and he's
[1:12:26] trying to tell you what he's trying to
[1:12:29] give you a laundry list of why that you
[1:12:31] can't do these things now God didn't
[1:12:34] give us one right he said those who he's
[1:12:37] justified he's already glorified
[1:12:39] I mean what you don't need to even
[1:12:41] expound on that
[1:12:44] and the heavens are part of the scroll
[1:12:47] when it rolled together every mountain
[1:12:48] ever island moved out of the place kings
[1:12:49] of the earth great me enriched me and
[1:12:51] chief captain mighty man
[1:12:52] they didn't make a rapture and every
[1:12:54] free man hid themselves in the dens and
[1:12:55] rocks of the mountains into the
[1:12:57] mountains said to the mountains
[1:12:58] following us and hide us from the face
[1:12:59] in the sitteth on the throne and from
[1:13:01] the wrath of the lamb for the great day
[1:13:03] of his wrath has come who shall be able
[1:13:06] to stand now we know for sure that that
[1:13:08] was the judgment seal of the word we
[1:13:11] read that brother Brown that's the quote
[1:13:13] brother answer this a judgement seal
[1:13:14] it's also the tribulation seal we are
[1:13:17] not here when that sixth seal opens in
[1:13:20] its reality because it is a total
[1:13:24] disruption of this earth remember it was
[1:13:27] open in a three-fold manner so what's
[1:13:30] God doing remember a sanctification is
[1:13:33] cleaned and set aside for service now
[1:13:37] God's already cleaned us up and he's
[1:13:39] cleaning us up now but he's getting
[1:13:41] ready to clean the earth up all right a
[1:13:43] total disruption of nature it's got to
[1:13:46] be you and I have got to have so much of
[1:13:48] a nature change that we can say I and my
[1:13:51] father are one and these other things
[1:13:53] and the Shutts gonna all pull away we
[1:13:56] were talking about a couple weekends ago
[1:13:57] and it's true because remember the life
[1:14:00] was in that shuck listen to me just from
[1:14:04] it the life was in the shuck at one time
[1:14:06] it was Green
[1:14:07] it was pliable and it was protecting the
[1:14:11] seed that was down inside it had life in
[1:14:15] it but that life moved from that shuck
[1:14:18] and went into the seed well what this
[1:14:22] dried up it's it rattles in the wind it
[1:14:27] protects that seed but what but it's not
[1:14:29] seed seed looks back to seed because
[1:14:33] when God put this in the seed in the
[1:14:35] ground it didn't look like a show it was
[1:14:38] seed that's what you and I have to look
[1:14:40] to we've had carriers we've had all
[1:14:42] these different places pleat people you
[1:14:44] and I all came through some kind of
[1:14:46] denomination you and I came through some
[1:14:49] kind of doctrine amen and at one point
[1:14:52] some of that doctrine God winked it to
[1:14:54] ignorance but now that we've come
[1:14:55] to where it's what seed time when it's
[1:14:59] seed time the shuts gonna pull away
[1:15:01] because you know why cuz if I say I and
[1:15:04] my father are one
[1:15:05] and I'm seed I'm seed I meant but if I'm
[1:15:11] Chuck I can't be seed you do all you
[1:15:17] won't do
[1:15:18] Chuck has a shock and the shuck can't
[1:15:21] stand for the wheat to say I seed and my
[1:15:26] father seed are one because that's what
[1:15:31] he said he said this shirts gonna pull
[1:15:32] away why because they can't stand it
[1:15:34] because it's not seed you and I have
[1:15:36] come to we see this right here in this
[1:15:38] part of sanctification God so burns this
[1:15:41] earth so much that he can walk on it
[1:15:44] now what about burning you so much that
[1:15:47] he can walk in you amen
[1:15:50] so that's what we're heading toward
[1:15:52] folks were heading toward that we're
[1:15:54] actually we're walking through it and in
[1:15:55] honor I believe that we're being washed
[1:15:59] by the water of the word were being this
[1:16:01] is the last great push of sanctification
[1:16:04] because listen when my body gets changed
[1:16:06] I don't need it I don't need
[1:16:09] sanctification I'm there it's like I was
[1:16:13] telling the church the other day or last
[1:16:15] Sunday you know we have faith right
[1:16:19] we're faith based people right but now
[1:16:24] what part of that then though becomes a
[1:16:27] reality because faith has the end
[1:16:29] somewhere brother Brown says faith alone
[1:16:30] won't do it because only you know what I
[1:16:34] got up this morning and I hoped by faith
[1:16:38] that my Chevrolet would make the journey
[1:16:42] up here with gas in it or not amen
[1:16:52] some people come here on empty
[1:16:55] some people come here full of herself I
[1:16:57] don't thank God for coming here empty
[1:16:59] anyway so I was hoping then listen this
[1:17:03] morning I knew we were having church it
[1:17:06] I had to be here at 9:30 or 9:00 o'clock
[1:17:09] right now my journey was the faith and
[1:17:12] the hope that I would get here but now
[1:17:15] the folks I don't have to hope I'm
[1:17:16] preaching I don't have to have faith
[1:17:19] that I'm preaching I am preaching I am
[1:17:24] preaching and that's what we've got to
[1:17:28] come to so what I was talking about in
[1:17:30] that in the acts of a play when you see
[1:17:32] those acts of a play those are people
[1:17:35] and they come to a great finale and when
[1:17:37] they come to finale what happened they
[1:17:39] walk out on the stage and they bow why
[1:17:41] because they're finished it's done
[1:17:43] they've completed what they didn't hope
[1:17:46] they got their lines right
[1:17:47] they didn't hope that the props worked
[1:17:52] they're finished
[1:17:53] so I read that scripture Jesus said it
[1:17:57] is finished you and I have to come to a
[1:17:59] place to where we say it is finished
[1:18:02] what Redemption then yeah is over for
[1:18:10] those that come to body change it will
[1:18:11] be you don't need it anymore but it's a
[1:18:15] total disruption of nature and it opened
[1:18:17] in a three-fold manner what was that
[1:18:18] threefold manner number one was it
[1:18:20] cleansed the 144,000 Jews that had to go
[1:18:24] through the tribulation to die it
[1:18:26] cleansed the foolish virgin because she
[1:18:30] had to go through the tribulation
[1:18:31] because she didn't receive the baptism
[1:18:32] of the holy ghost to clean her up while
[1:18:34] she was here right all right and then
[1:18:37] also then third fold was what the
[1:18:39] purging of the earth to get the earth
[1:18:41] ready for the Millennium and who's the
[1:18:43] Millennium Force for the Jews but you
[1:18:45] and I get to come back on a honeymoon
[1:18:47] and set with the Son of David on the
[1:18:50] throne in the Millennium and have a
[1:18:52] wonderful thousand years of just
[1:18:54] whatever we want to do it doesn't matter
[1:18:58] and by all right cuz remember too we got
[1:19:03] to look at this the Seventh Seal opens
[1:19:05] in a three-fold manner but we'll get to
[1:19:06] that later but remember then last Sunday
[1:19:08] two Sundays ago three
[1:19:09] ago we talked about the interval which
[1:19:11] is a gap or a time of just just hang on
[1:19:20] you know God created the world six days
[1:19:24] he rested the seventh
[1:19:26] now that's an allegory because God don't
[1:19:28] ever rest
[1:19:29] he didn't fold his arms up and go set up
[1:19:31] and a STONER star somewhere no he was
[1:19:34] finished with his physical creation
[1:19:36] right so he was done he rested but there
[1:19:41] was an interval of time and you know
[1:19:42] what that interval of time is this right
[1:19:44] now that interval of time is now that
[1:19:48] you and I are here today in time but
[1:19:51] we're not time creatures were caught in
[1:19:53] time because remember I said a few weeks
[1:19:57] ago that every time you see the interval
[1:19:59] between the seals the vowels the plagues
[1:20:01] the church ages and all these things you
[1:20:03] see the Holy Ghost come on the same Amen
[1:20:05] the same way with the statue of a
[1:20:07] perfect man you go
[1:20:08] one cuz remember face not an ad right
[1:20:13] one two three four five six there's a
[1:20:17] interval then the seventh so that's what
[1:20:21] we're in now we're in that interval time
[1:20:24] okay we're in that interval to where the
[1:20:27] Holy Ghost just looks like he's not
[1:20:29] doing anything but he's working he's
[1:20:33] doing something through you and I
[1:20:35] because as we said many times before
[1:20:39] brother branham tells us and we'll read
[1:20:41] them all next Sunday six seals is what
[1:20:43] finishes Redemption Jesus preached six
[1:20:46] seals and he stopped amen and also you
[1:20:52] look at the six fold purpose of Daniel
[1:20:54] what happens you've got one two three
[1:20:55] four five six then they got to build a
[1:20:58] Millennium temple and then we enter into
[1:21:00] the Millennium so there's always an
[1:21:01] interval that we have come to a place to
[1:21:04] where look we're finished we go into
[1:21:08] rapture we can say just like Jesus it is
[1:21:11] finished so I'm gonna read that
[1:21:13] scripture one more time I'm gonna read
[1:21:15] revelations eight one they didn't get
[1:21:16] that on that for some reason that's okay
[1:21:17] that's fine just they were yet
[1:21:19] revelations eight one will start near
[1:21:21] next Sunday and when he had opened the
[1:21:22] Seventh Seal
[1:21:23] there was silence in heaven about the
[1:21:26] space of half an hour Jesus in John 19
[1:21:30] verse 30 when Jesus therefore had
[1:21:33] received the vinegar he said it is
[1:21:35] finished and he bowed his head and gave
[1:21:39] up to go amen
[1:21:41] it is finished brother Brown says what
[1:21:44] is the Seventh Seal the end of the
[1:21:45] struggling world the end of all things
[1:21:54] so who's it going to end down who's it
[1:21:57] gonna end oh it's gonna end on the
[1:21:59] seventh seal who's gonna who's the
[1:22:00] seventh seal which all its brother
[1:22:02] branham I can keep talking y'all keep
[1:22:04] listening they say oh I know it's
[1:22:06] brother Branham got to come back or it's
[1:22:07] alright Lord I hate this one they say
[1:22:11] that's the seven seals polygamy why in
[1:22:13] the world all of y'all that just has one
[1:22:18] wife they say Amen that's right but you
[1:22:22] know what they made it everything but
[1:22:23] what it is it's Christ in you the hope
[1:22:27] of glory you are the manifestation of
[1:22:30] these seals these seals are not pieces
[1:22:33] of paper they're not quotes and comments
[1:22:37] it's a life it's what you live it's what
[1:22:41] you do is what you breathe is this
[1:22:44] message in flesh let's stand our feet
[1:22:50] this message has taken on flesh not
[1:22:54] words not piece of the paper its flesh
[1:22:59] this message is flesh if God was the
[1:23:03] Word made flesh then you or the word
[1:23:06] made flesh ain't no other way to look at
[1:23:09] it but that you and I are God in human
[1:23:14] flesh
[1:23:14] called the bride to finish this thing up
[1:23:18] Satan's gonna ride off and I hope he
[1:23:20] thought I hope he's already rode off in
[1:23:23] your life I hope he if he hadn't I hope
[1:23:25] he's getting ready to ride away because

[1:26:59] with this thank God for he meant we come
[1:27:03] to this time through the communion part
[1:27:06] we just thank God that he's allowed us
[1:27:10] to receive the truth to be able to
[1:27:12] follow it and to see what it means and
[1:27:14] you know they understand everything and
[1:27:17] to be as what we are let's just read our
[1:27:20] scripture then we'll go right on into
[1:27:22] the communion all said for I have
[1:27:28] received of the Lord that which also I
[1:27:30] delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus
[1:27:32] the same night in which he was betrayed
[1:27:34] took bread and when he had given thanks
[1:27:37] he brake it and said take eat this is my
[1:27:40] body which is broken for you this do in
[1:27:43] remembrance of me after the same manner
[1:27:45] also he took the cup when he had supped
[1:27:47] saying this cup is the New Testament in
[1:27:51] my blood this do ye as oft as you drink
[1:27:53] it in remembrance of me for as often as
[1:27:57] you eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:27:59] you do shew the Lord's death till he
[1:28:02] come or for whosoever shall eat this
[1:28:06] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:28:09] unworthily she'll be guilty of the body
[1:28:12] and blood of the Lord but a little man
[1:28:15] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:28:17] that bread and drink of that Cup where
[1:28:19] he that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:28:22] eateth and drinketh damnation to himself
[1:28:24] not discerning the Lord's body but this
[1:28:27] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:28:29] and many sleep where we would judge
[1:28:31] ourselves we should not be judged but
[1:28:33] when we are judged we are chastened of
[1:28:36] the Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:28:39] with the world wherefore my brethren
[1:28:41] when you come together to eat tarry one
[1:28:43] for another and if any man hunger they
[1:28:46] didn't eat at home that you come not
[1:28:48] together under condemnation the rest
[1:28:50] what I said in order when I come let's
[1:28:54] just have a few moments of silent prayer
[1:28:56] pray and one for the other
[1:28:58] but the Lord would bless us all and give
[1:29:00] us make us to be worthy to take the
[1:29:03] communion because he's the one that's
[1:29:06] done that for us right
