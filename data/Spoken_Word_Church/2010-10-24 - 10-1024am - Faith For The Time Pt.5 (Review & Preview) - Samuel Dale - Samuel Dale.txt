email from Brother Solomon you remember brother uh Jacob that Solomon Jacob that was going back to Israel you know they they live there and he sent us an email and said they reached home safely and said they really enjoyed being with us and everything so we we thank the Lord man we want to thank sister Gail for the all of the flowers that she's put up around and all downstairs and all we just we just appreciate iten sometimes we forget to mention things but just remember they're always seen Hebrews 6 Romans 9 Hebrews 4 uh remember to the Lord willing this coming Wednesday Brother Richard Wilson will be with us preaching for the Wednesday night service so remember that then we remember that we'll be having the fellowship together down their tances at the chicken house there and on Saturday starting at 2 come and be with us and you know we invite you to have a good time it's not just for the children CU last year when we had one around Easter it was really I think the adults enjoyed more of it than the kids did so just you know come and be with us just have a good time make sure you bring you a good jacket and uh brang you a cheer to set in too remember that all right then November the 6th which will be on Saturday will be our Bible study here at the church remember that the topic is on sanctification then on November the 7th brother Claude weinger will be here preaching for us so it just goes on and on and on of the different ones coming but we we really appreciate it remember all of these that I know Piggy's been having trouble with her back and Lisa's got trouble with hers and jun's got trouble with her back brother Dick's got trouble with his back remember everybody that's having trouble with their back and you that have had trouble you know enter there in and pray one for the other okay all right Hebrews 6 Romans 9 Hebrews 4 Heavenly Father we thank you for a day and a time that we can gather together and just sit down for a little bit and just Fellowship around your word Lord because that should be our desire for all of the time to be able to come together and to listen from you cuz we we can read your word but it takes you to give us the understand it so just have your way now forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness remember all the sick among us there's many things that here but you said you sent your word it healed us and delivered us from destruction thank you for all of the things the testimonies your love and your grace and Lord Just Have Your Way in Jesus name amen we read Hebrews 6 and just hold you page there and it'll be help you when you get back to Hebrews 4 cuz it's just over so Hebrews 6 therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward god of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment this and this will we do if God permits all right now so I said just hold that and drop over to to Romans 8 or excuse me Romans 9 and we'll read verse 30-33 what shall we say then that the Gentiles which followed not after righteousness have obtained to righteousness even the righteousness which is of Faith but Israel which followed after the law of righteousness hath not obtained to the law of righteousness wherefore other words why because they sought it not by faith but as it were by The Works of the law for they stumbled at The Stumbling stone that is is written behold I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and rock of offense and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed now go back over to Hebrews 4 let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of For unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them why not being mixed with faith in them that heard it you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now I wanted to uh continue on and you know we will but I mean I I wanted to uh bring another message and we'll take it up this afternoon but uh this has been on my mind all week and uh I just want to do it so we'll just we'll just review and preview a little bit of what we've been talking about and uh you know make sure that we understand it cuz I I was up this morning and i' been studied all yesterday afternoon for a long time and I was I'm completely satisfied with this afternoon message to to speak on it and have some thoughts going on down the line for other sermons but it just kept coming back and kept coming back so maybe we need to review a little bit you know of what we've been talking about and at least you'll know for sure what I'm saying and that way then you want to you know you want to misunderstand me but I I I don't want to just keep saying the same thing over again but Paul said sometimes that was needful because it's very helpful unto us all right but we've been talking about now for quite a while this is message number five we've been talking about going on to Perfection but we titled it faith for the time and uh you know trying to see why would Paul say that leaving the principles of the doctrines of Christ let us go on to Perfection you know he had a reason for saying that or he would not have made that statement and as I said to you then here's Paul preaching and he has the new birth and I believe that Paul had the the uh faith of the fathers you know I I believe that because of of him and what he was saying and how he was used to write the word and he went to the back side of the desert and stayed there for uh quite a while and came out and brother R said preaching the same thing that Peter did right so Paul was saying you know now let us lay aside not lay aside like do away with right that is not the understanding uh that is there it's not doing away with it U good to see our brother back there with us but I think he's been here before so okay forget it you get welcome that time good to see you though you but uh see Paul said then going on laying aside right and as I said you you build a building you pour the foundation right but you don't leave that Foundation right you build on top of it right but you must must leave the foundation cuz you're not back down hammering on it and chipping on it and working on it you're you you leave there so that's what Paul is saying to to go on to Perfection right and going on in the revealed word amen and that was his desire right all right so Paul would call it you know going on unto Perfection all right Peter would call it uh growing in Grace and knowledge you know and things like that and we know that the first thing that we've seen the very principles of all Christianity is the new birth right because that's where our beginning is at amen and we are to build a body of Christ amen and see then in building that we must go on and not just stay with the feet all the time and you know continue to to pick around on on little bitty things because uh you know we need to continue on that's right but see it's growing in Grace and knowledge so it will take the revealed word now that's my whole point right of of trying to bring it I wrote it in here twice to make sure and I underlined it but see perverted word that's it right there perverted word will not bring you unto Perfection amen that's right see there there's no way it's it's because you're you're trying to build a body of Christ and how can you put something in the body of Christ as you're coming down see that would would be different from what the others and in the Old Testament each one of those prophets they Dove tail together it may not sound like it sometimes but give it a little time and read it and they'll all be bringing the beautiful picture as it's building the body of Christ see then in the New Testament see we must build the body of Christ see the bride of Christ comes forth building a body upon Earth and in doing that it can't be perverted word right all right so we can't use that to to uh you know to say well we had this and we had that well we had part of it right right we understood things in part that's right but when that which is perfect the scripture says is come then that which is in part is done away that's right now Peter is not or Paul neither one is saying see to do away but don't stay down on the bottom all the time like I said people of the message will say we don't want to get into those deep things well now why did God write it in his word that's right amen it's not that now forgive me is not that the same way we talked when we were in organized religion and we said stay out of the Book of Revelations oh my cuz we don't understand it come on you you can't understand Genesis just be in the little simple things of the new birth and and and just being good people and all like that well now that's why I read what Paul said about the the children of Israel right because the children of Israel they was keeping the dos and the don'ts to the letter right I mean they had her down to the letter right but yet what was their trouble as Paul said that they were trying to establish not the righteousness of God by faith right but they were trying to establish their own righteousness I don't do this and I don't do that remember the the man praying you know and Lord I pr I do this and I'm not like that sinner but there was a sinner down there just saying Lord forgive me amen the scripture tells you which one was forgiven now but see Paul says the children of Israel sought it not by faith right all right by Revelation all right now could we be that way and just want to settle down and you know and and stay with the things when Paul was laying down some pretty good Doctrine and calling it principles one God baptisms resurrection of the Dead Eternal judgment those are pretty strong meat right you know I mean I'm not throwing that to anybody but you couldn't walk across the street over here to this church and preach those things right see you would be ousted after just a little bit right you know why because they don't believe it that's right right but now for us to stay on those little things was my whole point see then we can be like Israel and we canot seek it by faith see and be as we read in in Hebrews that the gospel being preached unto us it won't profit us anything well if I just get to heaven well that's that's a good point that's that's all right but we're not in the time of just saying let's be good and go to church and you know that's that's not today you and I living that was a day and a time to just call yourself a Christian at one time would get you killed right but see we're protected by the law and we thank God for it and and the things today to be able to to believe what we believe but that will be fastly taken from us but the thing of it is in the time that we have see we should spend our time trying to to uh lay up right you know now if you knew you know if you knew that next year we're all going to be without a job and we got a couple of more months or three or something you know the end of the year uh the what would you do if you knew everybody's going to be out of work next year what would you do right now not just halfhazard but knowing that everything going to be out Ain going to be working well everybody' be storing up a little money right everybody be putting you wouldn't be going out and buying all these fancy new stuff you'd be buying some food you'd be buying the Necessities to be able to live for a year all right now is that true well see then that's the way it should be in the gospel right in the gospel we should be getting prepared for whatever will come all right which means we need to get into the word right amen right see we need to get into the reveal word now when I say word that's right I'm not talking about letters on a page right amen when I talk about the word of God I'm talking about the revealed word of God Amen because we prove through the point of our many messages that we can actually take the letter of the word and Paul look at the statement he made he said the letter kill it right now he was saying even the things he preached would kill us right if it wasn't revealed amen right see I'm talking about the revealed word see and we must in this day believe that God has given us the fully revealed work now I got it right over here so I'll just read it to you you say well brother Dale do you believe you have the perfect interpretation I have the message right right I believe the message is perfect right now and I believe that what's been revealed to me is perfect amen all right amen I believe what's been revealed to you is perfect right that's what makes it perfect see when it's revealed not letters come on not to be able to quote it not to be able to read it off the computer screen right right but for it to be a reality living in our hearts and lives we see that way then so you can't leave the principles like we interpret that is saying because the principles that that we stand on was the revelation of one God the revelation of you know the Resurrection The revelation of the judgment and how it can be see those are part of it but we can't stay on that we must continue on that's right amen now what I'll be doing in the next couple of services I know will be illustrating some things to you all right now I I try to do that because I believe illustrations help if if we had a drawing board we'd draw it out you know up here and I know we can set up some things but we just not set up too good for for that but I believe illustrations help right amen and I believe reminding us helps right and see that way then you can't come up and say well brother Dale you said so and so I said what H that's right but I Illustrated it to you I showed you what I meant by what I was saying right I I like to use illustrations because that that opens the mind of the individual to be able to receive and we'll be taking some things to show how did you start and go on you can take the Bible you can take the prophet's message and you can isolate one thing and you can bring it from the Bible and the prophet's message message as to what you're talking about and it be right what you're saying but yet then something else will be said well what are you going to do with that well I'm going to just stay with this well now that's not going on that's right right that's right going on is to to take what you've got the new birth is where you must start at right all right right the Apostle Paul had the new birth amen all right and we'd have to agree by the time he come here in Hebrews of writing that he was standing there with the faith of the fathers even to understand greater things than the Peter and the apostles did right all right and and doing that then Paul says okay all right we're in 100% agreement we need a new birth that's number one we need the understanding of one God right we need to understand the resurrection that's right and about hell and how it can not be Eternal but yet God can have eternal judgment because once he judges you that's judgment's over there's no court of appeal see he saying then now let's go on let's eat the the greater things you remember the children of Israel they had Mana you know in the wilderness the bread came down the Mana right you know people don't take hear me they don't understand what words I'm saying but the bread in the wilderness m a n n a n I guess is or n m a n n a all right but see they had that mana and it was beautiful right it was wonderful and they lived by each day and it came each day but they couldn't hold over right see because that would be the example of doing what we're saying staying on the foundation let me get a little extra today because it might not be any tomorrow well now that's doubting God I mean if he bring it one day why can't he bring it the next day so you said yeah with little quick well you know there was a time the Mana did cease you know what right you did her Bible learned you know what I'm tell you when they entered the promised land the land of Canaan right and they ate of the old corn of the land you know the manist righten all right but what did they do well don't have anything to eat I guess if we get anything to eat we got across Jordan which is type of death you know but we got to across Jordan we got got to go back in the wilderness and find the Mana no what happened amen the old corn of the land became a stronger meat unto them you know a meal unto them right than what the Mana was and it wasn't getting something you know it was the same thing it was just not God bringing it to them from on they were going to have to do some things to get it yourself but now when they first got there they didn't have to right he gave it to them see showing what it was going to be and the prophet of God said what a deeper revelation of the word of God right Amen in the adoption series he covers that a deeper Revelation am was what the old corn stood for all right now then it's in the Bible that we can bring it out to show you know from the from this to this and this to this and this to this see but there was a day the Mana was perfect but there was a day when you couldn't go out and gather it but to show that it was part of the word of God and not leaving the principles like we think y then they took a pot and they put the Mana down in the pot they put the pot behind the veil in the inner Veil you know inner Court not just the the second Veil and sometimes you you you got confusion in that and and you you don't understand um you know David went in and ate the shoe bread right but you better check it out the shoe bread is not the Mana right see you study here I send you second court right he didn't go behind the veil he would have been killed right amen all right but see then check that out but see behind the veil there was a pot and you know what I'm just honest I swe I think no I think if they still had that pot and could find it that that Mana would still be good right amen cuz it was set aside for each priest right the succession of priest that would come they would be able to reach in and get a B they couldn't take a handful in their pocket and take it out with them you know they they couldn't do nothing like that but it showed that leaving the principles is not like what we think right is taking that as a foundation and continue on amen that's right it's like your Prophet preaching one true and living God and then one day God opened the seals to him right then we'll get back to this and what did he say in other words what happened he said my Revelation right right that Jesus and God is a self-same person amen he said thereby amen that's got to be the Antichrist because he knew what he's talking about right why the the the Mana had become the old corn right he kept going on in the word and see there's Paul now watch it Paul back there so I'm going to try to come through now and listen Paul back there in the he had the new birth right and he was going on to Perfection right well you know what brought it brought him to the Statue of a perfect man where we call it the faith of the fathers all right right okay he brought him to that place that was Perfection compared to his Perfection of the new birth amen that was greater Perfection not something different it was like the Mana and the old corn it was just going on in the word it was a greater opening of the word right right right now see that went down through a while but it was lost in the Dark Ages not the holy the Holy Spirit was not taken away it was the word that was taken away the the ability to be able to understand was taken away all right but see Martin Luther came out one day preaching the just shall live by faith now watch that this afternoon that just shall live by faith put them people if they believed it in the body of Christ right right he put them in the body of Christ cuz it was a new birth right and Martin Luther would say now let's go on see he could read Paul let's go on to Perfection he probably wondered what that meant and pondered it but he still wanted to go on some of those people went on and picked up in the days of John Wesley see some of them said we're going to stay with Luther yep we got it we got the books we got the texes we got it all set up like the people of the message today right we got it all ready let's stay with this and watch them deep things now watch them intellectual preachers and all they'll they'll they'll confuse you you know they they they'll mess you up cuz they're just preaching about intellect well what's wrong with the people that can't preach at all that's right I'm sorry I'm just I'm blunt oh Lord you know my thought's always been one thing if it was not for us why did God put it in the word that's right and if the message is not for us why did God send a prophet to preach it to us all he had to do is send him down and tell him you got it sit down take it easy we'll get out of your a while no that Prophet was constantly why because down to those dark ages and the things we could go through a long course of it actually what they done when they when they cabbage down on that word it become a caral reform right a time of reformation right now remember we read that from the prophet so you can take this message and make it carnal reform right I'm still thinking you're in the message when you're only in Reformation right Reformation is simply just quitting what you're doing and go start doing something else right and that's the way the people are the message people believe and if it's your then you know I'm against it people say well we come in the message what else you want me to do right I mean we're in the message well see that becomes stale stagnant because we must keep on growing amen right I have always tried to keep something out ahead of you right to to be able to keep you interested in coming back to hear the rest of the story Paul Harvey would say cuz I I see I want to go on but God sent a prophet see to restore those things that's right and he had to be standing with the faith of the fathers or God would have not ow unfolded the rest of the word under him right amen but he had to grow into that right amen but remember remember he was a prophet you said who taught brother ROM God did who taught Paul right right all right right who taught Paul he said nobody didn't teach him I didn't get it from man he got on the back side of the Desert from God why because he was a prophet right now here's my point you just me and you couldn't wear out on the back side of the desert and get it ourselves see that's what we think right you can't do it God had to send us a prophet Amen to be able to teach us us the revelation of the word of God right but that Prophet was constantly going on to Perfection what he would see one day then he he'd see something then he'd climb and he'd see something he'd climb and he'd see something I listening to him one day on on a tape and I thought oh God you know he said now I got a scripture right here he preached and he preached and he preached and at while he'd say now now I got another scripture listen to it you know what cuz he preached up that point and then something else was unfolding something else was unfolding it's a constant climbing is not doing away with anything that's right Martin Luther the truth of the just shall live by faith is a basic foundation for Christianity but to stay with what he taught would become dead works that's right was that what Paul called it amen for us to just stay with the message is you know well well we understand we believe this and we believe that you know but we don't believe we don't want to go any further now why what are you afraid of well brother I'm afraid of getting confused don't worry about it that's right you born that way right you know and until God reveals it we're still that way that's right if there something you're looking in the Bible you're looking in the prophet's message and you see it looks like two things y you know or some contradiction just remember you don't see the Revelation that's right that's sensible right right I sat down many a time and and studied on the godhead and I could just see it so beautiful it would just unfold Through the Bible the next day you could ask me what I saw and I couldn't even tell you right amen come on are you that way right because see it's it's something else that God wants to reveal come on and like I've always tried to tell you what we have today is just a foundation when we come to tomorrow oh my come on right what we have today what we hear today if you hear something today that you hadn't heard you know put together in a way for God to reveal it I don't mean you hadn't heard the words right right you know what that tomorrow will be that'll just be a foundation that's right you know what it'll be a former rain come on it'll be a former rain see because the latter rain must come on each one of the forers or there's no need of it all right but you understand what I'm saying yes see then when this message came this message is to take you and I to a change of the you agree to a change and a Rapture we're not looking for something other somewhere another Messenger to come brother Dale to be able to tell you what it is no I can't tell you what it is the Holy Ghost is the only revealer of the word amen but neither can brother random tell you what it is come on brother it takes God to reveal it that's right he can say the letter of the words and the things and surely we know perfectly well that he never brought is perverted word come on what was the things that was not right like the White Horse riter Etc he corrected himself right that's right what had to be corrected about the understanding of the evidence of the Holy Ghost he told us that right and he said I used to believe that we said I don't believe that now you know why he is going on to Perfection amen the that's right through the revealing of God's word will take you and I to Perfection that's right we don't have to go somewhere else the prophet turned us back to the Bible that's right right and see then if we can't take the Bible and the prophet's message right people will argue and say well brother R's not here but the message is here right that's right you know I mean one thing for certain at least we can sit down now with the computer abilities the way we have it and we can sit down and and discuss something and we have the ability to be able to cover the whole message whereas it used to be I remember brother Mo telling this he heard brother brandham you know one day when he was up at Jeffersonville there preaching and he he heard him he said and said there was Adam said he sinned and was cast out of the garden he said you know what it was months before we ever got another tape or heard another sermon and said you know what I thought during that time there was Adam cast out of the garden because he sinned I said that looks bad he said but then one day we got a takee and brother Ram said but when Adam was cast out of the garden that he had an atonement made for him he had a covering we see that took it away and that's all I'm trying to do about all the word it's not to show how smart you are but it's to show that God's word is perfect and we must go on in the revealing of the word but part word now what go this see perverted word won't do it we' all agree that yes h but see part word won't do it right part word comes because of our ignorance because we haven't heard maybe right amen that could be part word but see then when we sat down and cabage down on it and refuse to go on then what we have will become part word and there's no way to go to Perfection that's right amen I I I what I don't understand I'm honest I'm sorry I'm just an old human being and I just talk human I just don't understand how that we can have this message as it is and then there' be so many splits doctrinal issues that people differ about out of one message amen right the Baptist is not that confusing right is that true right they may argue and fuss over a little bit thing but they'll tell you the basics right you going to get baptized that's right if you go to that Baptist Church right I don't care how many times you've been baptized I don't care if the pope of Rome baptized you and and dedicated you and whatever he done I don't care who done it you go into the Baptist Church you're going to get baptized that's a Basics to see in this message is just anything just well there don't go off on that brother he that's just his way of seeing it now you mean there's two ways of seeing something that problem long time ago you know I don't believe in two ways to see something well you just we just you just stubborn about what well come in let's talk about it I've always been willing to sit down and discuss what I believe right but is always say now don't come along with a little six or seven and start talking about brother d i don't agree with you on some statements you made the other day you know now show it to me prove to me in the Bible where I'm wrong right why because I want to go on Amen see we talk about a Rapture when your Prophet told us what it was he said the Rapture is a revelation well what are we looking for he didn't say the Rapture is reading this message he didn't say the Rapture was studying this message putting it together doing a great discourse upon something you know what I'm saying and taking all the quotes right the computer is not going in the Rapture you may think a lot of your on it 9 10 12 hours a day but that's good brother no it's not going that's right the the books and the tapes is not going that's right it's a group of people that the word becomes alive in them is where the Rapture is going to be the prophet said the bride would be Wai amen the bride would be waiting for the revelation of the Rapture come on well you know what waiting for the revelation of rapture means right if I don't have the revelation of rapture right now you know what that statement said I'm waiting for it that's right amen but when it comes see I won't be waiting for it that's right amen now I may have to wait for it to be made manifest see Paul that's what I tried to show you what Paul was doing when Paul said you chaining a on the trick of an ey he had the Revelation he seen it right but he couldn't attain un to that's right cuz had he done that you and I wouldn't be here that's right amen praise the Lord amen he said but we'll go on to these things if God permit that's right but you know God didn't permit him to go on that's right right but you know what I'm standing on today you know the Revelation that I'm waiting on today on the revelation of rapture is what he showed Paul that's right that's right he said number brother I want your you don't know what you're talking about that's right because if it won't compare to what Paul said right and if it's not the same Revelation Paul had then brother Ram didn't have the right Revelation that's right amen that's right and when he said we have the perfect interpretation come on he didn't stop at that he said with Divine Vindication in other words God Vindicated it right Paul God Vindicated what Paul said right amen right right right now if you don't get it how Vindicated get this one thing what Paul said I'm looking forward to it amen right amen so the Vindication is the people who believe the word of God righten let us go on to Perfection amen let us keep praying God give us each day our daily bread what we have today I mean man you can eat a seven course meal you can do all you want to but you know tomorrow you can talk all you want to about it that's Brother Gary back there has always wanted to go out there and try that 72 oce steak and I'd like to go with him I believe if anybody get close to eating it he can but you know what if he ate the whole time that's right the next day he could talk about it but you know what that old gut would be growling like everything that's the only thing I've ever done in the message of the hour and I realize that what we have today becomes a former Reign for God to be able to move on right and bring more unto usen that's right am to open the word so then perverted word we're not even talking about it that's not what Paul is talking about there in in Romans they had the word of God right those children of Israel had the word to the letter but they sought it not by faith that's right amen they could explain all of them seven compound names with Jehovah but they could explain every scripture it's even said that they a scroll could be wrote up and they could stick a pen through there and they could tell you the letters that it went through right why because they had read it so many times but Paul said now your problem is you're not seeking it by faith amen you're not seeking a revelation of what that is you're only wanting to do or don't do right and you think by doing or don't doing that that's going to make you a place right but you see church I've said over and over we can have this letter to the this message letter to the perfect but if it's not revealed then I believe that the things blood of random said if we wait upon a revelation they will come together I believe that amen amen right something he would say one day looking totally contrary to what he would say even maybe in the same message statements he'd make if we wait upon God and let him reveal it you'll find out brother around couldn't say it no other way right you know on the Statue of perfect man that brother ROM never read the scripture over the other scripture where it talks about the stature of a perfect man right the fullness of stature he didn't read that yeah my wife asked me one day saidh didn't he read this scripture I said because the Holy Ghost didn't want him to read it right that he didn't use that one scripture would have been really the very wording that right see you know why God didn't want him to right see sometimes in my preaching I know and realize that that I try my best to bring something down so close until I realized that I have to watch it cuz Satan can get there right and he can tell you that that's what you got because it's been brought down so straight and so perfect until there's no way to argue about it well I just don't believe it well that's all right it's all right but don't blame me for wanting to go on right when we left to church and came here and started this work the first church first message I preached was going Beyond man's Camp I'm still want to do that that's still my goal is to go beyond man's Camp because man's Camp will sit down and die on something I want to go on I want to keep going on see why because the Rapture is a revelation we read that see and we get to Great Revelation about it but we fail to read the same sentence where he said and the bride will will be waiting for the revelation of the Rapture and I've told you what I believe I don't believe the Rapture could have ever taken place if brother random had to come and preach that message I Hest why because he was putting together all of the scriptures that's right and you go back to the Rapture and find out if I'm not right that he covers from the New Birth all the way up he doesn't leave all of this is part of it leaving the principles and going on to Perfection is not leaving word that is revealed it is leaving our dead letter form that we thought made us right it is the things that we didn't have right it was the partial realization that we were just trying to hold on to that we think that's it we must go on to perfect realization and then the word will fit together M amen things that I studied on I've studied on some things for 20 years before I ever preach it and I could give you every quote and every scripture that brother ROM used but I would not preach it until God revealed it how many of people in the message would open they say that they' studied on something 20 years before they preach it I just get what the prophet said and I just preach it it's up to God to you that's why there's so much error that's right that's right so much error brother brand makes some statements and those statements he made keeps me from preaching some things that I believe I could see but you know what when he made the statement he's the prophet not me that's right but you understand what I'm trying to say yes we say we have the complete interpretation and that's what your Prophet said that was one of the last quotes of the day and I believe that this message of the hour not the way so and so interprets so and so brother Dale interprets anybody interprets not any of that I believe the message is the perfect interpretation amen perfect enough to take us in a Rapture right Amen to change these our bodies and take us into right right I believe that but you see when we're looking at something and we see it and it looks contradictory you cannot rightly have faith right that's where somebody like me comes along you know brother D what are you I'm just me people have said I'm a teacher well if I I am a teacher now you got plent plenty of quotes from brother brandom that said the teachers is when messed it up oh but do you go on and quote the rest of it where that R said that that nobody touch the teacher putting it together and do you read the others where he said the teacher is the one that positionally places you in the body see see you can use quotes for what you want you can make the teacher look bad that's right now honestly that poor brother R said the teachers in Christ of Min God reveal I'm pretty sure he said where the teachers is one I believe that the fivefold Ministries he's talking about right amen not just one teachers he's talking about all the teachers of the fivefold ministry not just a teacher right and I'm not defending that point I'm just making a statement right because Ever every preacher don't matter where your Apostle Prophet Pastor V teacher whatever you're supposed to be able to teach in the capacity that you are see we can say it and say well now the teachers when messed it up we see what are you trying to say I'll tell you what one man said he said that it was not the five-fold ministry that went off the word in the Dark Ages it was the deacons the elders etc etc well he was the one that wrote the book you know yeah I'm just telling you he was the one that wrote the book in the book The Church age book in the church age book brother R said it was the five-fold ministry that went off in the ages that's right what right see but yet he says that it wasn't a fivefold Ministry going on well you know who I'm going to believe right amen but I don't understand how you can sit down and pin something and then come out with an idea like that I don't get that but let's just listen when the word is fully revealed the Rapture will come right I believe that I said fully revealed amen now that's around the world Amen right that is not just Lula right around the world amen when the word is fully revealed then the Rapture will come because the revealed word can never be perverted word come on God can't God can't reveal a Trinity there's no such thing right people are say oh I got that Revelation in the Trinity where'd you get it you didn't get it from God cuz God don't know a Trinity right well I'm just trying to explain something well what you're trying to explain sure is messed up that's right like I said now see there's no doubt about the word of God there shouldn't be we have the texes we have the books we have the computer to be able to run it with and the only reason I use the word computer is the fact that you can just run so much of it that's right amen people say I don't like them old computers and that computer ain't going to say nothing that that ain't put in it that's right I'll just stay with the books well I can show you some places in the books used to be a lot of them that there's a lot of mistakes made in the books see because some man wouldn't put that in the book for took it off and put it in the book for well now see but let's don't be like one man told waiting us one time he said we're talking in a group I've told you about it my wife punched me cuz she thought I was going to take it up because but the man said I don't read that Church A's book oh said the reason I don't said Le's wife wrote it yeah she said I'm no not hearing a big crowd the next morning I just mentioned it to them I said brother you made a statement yesterday and I said you know you said that brother Lee Vil's wife wrote the book I said brother Lee Vil is the one that wrote the church A's book not his wife right well I've been told that his wife wrote it I said his wife probably did type some of it out might have done that but she didn't write it right he said well all brother I can't read what he said and I'm I was honest you know and I I knew then why I didn't say something in front of everybody because I would have been belittling him and I knew I didn't want to do that but I said brother I said brother random okay to church hbook I said then it's okay to read it you know see because it's the word of God that's right that's it's the word of God the Bible is the word of God this message is the word of God but we've been talking about that we've got to go on to Perfection the new birth is wonderful but the new birth is like a baby born amen you don't want it to stay that way right you want it to grow up it's not made to stay that way so you feed it you help it you you take care of it see until one day it'll stand there in its own Perfection you know what and it can have children and you amen and all it'll produce that's all I tried to do about the word of God is to get you and I to take what we have but not cabbage down on it and just keep going on keep going on and keep going on right the things that all of the other I don't I didn't mean all okay the thing that most of the ministers do is they're scared of something got around preached oh amen cuz they're afraid to get it wrong I honor them for that that's a fine but somebody has got to break the message down to us cuz your Prophet when said that was what would take place he said to I Ministry take the message and break it down to the people now I didn't say that your Prophet said it we see people that won't even go to church they won't have nothing to do with a five-fold Ministry until they got a burial or a Baby dedicated then when they do my phone will ring they want me to go bury somebody or something and I found out here the other day you know that they they wound up in one place taking communion this brother has to come down and give them communion cuz tape recorder can't give you communion that's not a joke it's true that's right yeah but that's what we do see we don't believe in this but we got these little bitty quirks that we've got to go with and see yeah go we don't want to put on a tape at a funeral and just let it play you know and then go bury the body but now listen we have the perfect interpretation right and God Vindicated the prophet's message to be true amen all right but now let's take this life statement you know that brother brandham said the bride would vindicate come on Malachi 4 come on brother brother don't need Vindicated he look Vindicated see now you're the one that's to arguing with him not me amen R said the bride would vindicate Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelation 10:7 now what does vindicate mean see we think vindicate means you got to raise the dead to heal the sick do no the Bride of Jesus Christ sure I believe that she will be doing that I believe in the bride of Christ around the world the dead is being raised the sick has been healed wonderful marvelous things are taking place around the world in the bride of Christ I believe that that right am but the main thing is to do what you want to do the works of God what is the works of God well he sit now what is the works of God right to believe them that he sins so we believe brother Brand's message right amen we believe his message was Vindicated but you see if it's not made manifest by somebody that's it amen you know then there won't be a Rapture right amen it may just be one person it doesn't matter if it's one 10 me that doesn't make any B of difference it's one person that has to do with the Vindication and still proves what he said the bride will vindicate right right well they got dealing the sick over here and they that's right cuz that's partial realization that's right it's still working it's partial realization but you know who's doing it if the sick's being healed God's doing it dead being raised God's doing right I don't care who's doing the other part of it right God has to be the one to heal a sick but you see let us go on in the message of the hour right well brother it's been 40 years okay maybe they give us maybe God will give us 40 more you know what he'll give us 40 more if we need it right right cuz he promised it that's right he promised it you see back in those days years ago people were saying you know they used the quote as a u an ability to be able to uh show how smart they were but years ago the people would read the quote out of the Daniel 70 weeks and they'd say if you don't understand the Daniel 70 weeks that's what brother BR says verbatim almost wor if you don't understand Daniel 7 which you can't understand the seals and those things then they turn around and see you understand Daniel 7 W is it three and a half or seven one brother said well just put it together it's three and a half and seven that makes 10 and a half but see people wouldn't try to preach Daniel 70 weeks right so thereby the seals became a taboo for them somebody to try to preach but you see God revealed a said to we amen that's right so we could understand that's right the seals amen so we can understand then he's revealed a lot of things from that time on right cuz we don't have to go back and change any of it right right what I believe there I believe today in 1969 in Athens Georgia I preached that the Bride of Jesus Christ would be the son of man on the earth in the last day the revealed word right amen 1969 you know I still believe that amen amen you know that 69 how many that's 40 something years M you know I still believe it you know why I believe it cuz it's true cuz I was reading what the prophet said and believing what he said it wasn't my idea I just like everybody else but when God reveals something to me I don't have no trouble challenge that's why we open up the internet it's out there I ain't challenging nobody to nothing I'm just telling you what I've left that's right you can take it do what you want to with it it's up to you you can ridicule it you can do anything you want to that's your problem right I just try to say what I say right and believe what I believe right but I am open internet or anywhere to anyone to come show me where I preach from amen now I don't mean a quote right you know except for me come on Brothers I don't mean like the other day when I was trying to make November and October the same month boy brother I got you well that's all right I'm not going off on nobody called you corrected me I'm just saying wouldn't that be something for me to get something off the internet to come back and say it was wrong War are wrong you said I told supposed to be November no get in the Bible right right show me where I'm off this word show me where I've ever taught anything that's not in this Bible right show me where I've never Tau what the prophet said that's right the 70 weeks the seals the marriage and divorce the one God the the things come and let's talk about it why cuz I want to go on to Perfection maybe you have what I have need of so let's go on to Perfection but let's don't forget these things that's what the people of the message there's a big doctrine of the people of the message like this that until' 62 brother Brandon was preaching but when the seals broken the things is a different message because this over here straightened all that out back there now show to show me where it did show me where it did the son of man come to straight and brother ran them out no that's right I thought that it didn't take the seals to make him right a prophet I thought he's born a prophet and being born the prophet he never believed in the Trinity because it was unscriptural but yet he had a Baptist Bible and converted them to a Baptist faith until God revealed amen he said one day I used to think Jesus loved me and God hated me he never believ in the Trinity when I proves he did no it didn't show you where he said let's stand together and address the third person of the Trinity that didn't mean he's trary right he's talking about your third person not his is cuz he didn't believe in one see that's where that all it takes is just simply let the Holy Spirit but let's go on in this message the way has been made for you and I to go on now I believe that I believe the way has been made I believe now he has permitted the word to come to the place right to where that we can walk off the earth in a rure amen I believe that amen I believe that's earnestly contending for the faith and I believe that there a lot of things maybe we don't understand how it goes together it's all right but God will reveal what we have need of but let's don't let this message become dead works or carnal reform right and just get down on the foundation and just play around let's go on you know that they took that old corner of the land and you know what they done with it right there wasn't enough corn in the land for them to live off of all the rest of the years they live there they ate the old corn of the land but then they took that and planted it amen amen hallelujah and you know what they received a crop off of that exactly what they put in the ground that they've been eating old corn so they never did quit eating old corn come on right Hallelujah they took the word of God Amen done what they're supposed to do with it down to the ages this word was planted into the ground and it's come back out amen and here now in full maturity for you and I all we got to do is just reach up and get a ear and start eating on come on most of you don't like to eat maybe corn like some of us Old-Timers do you know but you ever stop in a store and buy you a bag of corn nuts I know I don't like nothing like that Harmony ever eat any Harmony you know where Harmony comes from it don't come from green corn it comes from dried fully material corn corn nuts is not made for the corn where you pull it off the stock and you can eat it then oh it waits till it dries see this word is greater each day amen just to eat on it amen what let's stand 5 23 INSP just forgive me for REM relieving from my soul what I I just I don't wanted to preach this evening's message and then go into another message I wanted to do that and I wrote the notes for that but maybe what I've said will help somebody to at least understand what I believe maybe somebody was confused about what I said but see I believe believe in going on Amen I believe in going on in the word amen go ahead brother this is the even it's better the bright have I still believe in I still believe in shine you mean we come to the word and not believe all of that behind us is the foundation J got a problem with their back I know they and she's doing that for herself but she wants to stand for sister ly's mother they don't know exactly yet about what it all is all right so they're running test to see they got her in the hospital so let's just believe everything will be all right amen father we lay our hands upon our sister believeing with h that sister gw's mother will be all right and all will be well all is taken care we just ask you them to down and tou you their back we believe your word We Believe by your stripes in Jesus anybody else just comeing let see if you're not hungry after
