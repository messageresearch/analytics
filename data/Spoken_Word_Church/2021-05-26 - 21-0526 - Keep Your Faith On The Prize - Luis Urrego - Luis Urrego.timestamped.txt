[7:31] amen
[7:32] um you might have your seats for just a
[7:35] moment i want to
[7:36] i want to just want to bring in a little
[7:38] update if the brothers in the back can
[7:41] can bring up the slides
[7:46] i don't know if y'all can see that can
[7:48] you all see that in the back
[7:50] okay all right um if you remember
[7:54] about two months ago i had asked for the
[7:56] church to
[7:58] if they could support i asked brother
[8:01] dale if he could support
[8:03] give a little offering to this family
[8:04] who had lost
[8:06] well just to make a long story short
[8:09] they had lost
[8:10] their child last year in november all
[8:13] year long the child was sick
[8:15] and it passed away in november and so
[8:17] because of them having to be at the
[8:18] hospital constantly and things like that
[8:21] they had to leave their home a lot and
[8:23] when they would get back to their house
[8:25] their house was
[8:26] was the people would have come in
[8:29] thieves would come in and taken their
[8:31] things their belongings not only that
[8:33] they even took even parts of the house
[8:35] as well
[8:36] so the brother when they got back after
[8:39] the
[8:40] the the death of their little
[8:42] one-year-old
[8:43] um he wanted to just move the family
[8:46] elsewhere he thought it was a dangerous
[8:47] area so
[8:48] um he wanted to build in this area so
[8:52] i felt in my heart to just see if we
[8:54] could get him a little home so
[8:56] i uh when we got the money i know uh
[8:59] you know several of the brothers they
[9:01] they contributed and of course the
[9:03] church supported
[9:04] a good portion of it um
[9:08] i sent the money about just a few days
[9:10] later and
[9:11] about two weeks later they started
[9:12] building the the little house
[9:14] so here so i told the brother i said
[9:16] just send me pictures and
[9:18] mainly i'm just i'm just interested in
[9:20] the final project
[9:22] but he just wanted to send me pictures
[9:24] and things during the whole process so
[9:26] i just wanted to show you all this this
[9:28] is uh as they were building
[9:30] um so you can see there next
[9:34] and so here this is where they they
[9:37] started
[9:38] uh continuing next
[9:42] and here they're making progress now i
[9:46] honestly i thought that they you know it
[9:48] was going to take them maybe
[9:50] at least a month month and a half two
[9:51] months to build
[9:53] brothers build this chair this this
[9:55] little their little house in like three
[9:56] weeks
[9:59] he was desperate i mean they were pretty
[10:00] much homeless they were pretty much
[10:02] homeless so that
[10:03] he had he had help from some family
[10:06] members
[10:06] and uh and they got down to it
[10:10] next here's they got the the windows up
[10:14] this is the brother right here
[10:18] next this is their little bathroom right
[10:21] there
[10:24] next all right so this is the family now
[10:28] they've moved in into the little
[10:29] the little home now next
[10:34] that's them it would have been four of
[10:36] them but they lost
[10:38] their little one-year-old son next
[10:58] foreign
[11:12] is

[14:32] before we get started our heavenly

[14:44] thank you lord that you helped provide
[14:46] this little home for the
[14:48] brother mario and his family lord god
[14:50] and and certainly lord jesus they
[14:52] they were in in hard times father and

[14:57] loved one their father a little baby
[14:59] lord
[15:01] father but lord you made it all work out
[15:03] for them lord jesus and we just thank
[15:05] you for that father
[15:07] lord we commit the rest of the service
[15:09] into your hands
[15:10] we ask that you would help us to receive
[15:12] something lord god tonight that would
[15:14] uplift our faith encourage us lord to
[15:16] move forward lord
[15:18] and lord jesus may you be the speaker
[15:20] tonight lord god help me to yield myself
[15:22] to you lord god

[15:25] to say and lord
[15:27] you just bless your people tonight we
[15:28] commit this time into your hands now
[15:31] in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen
[15:34] praise the lord amen we want to read
[15:37] here in in
[15:37] in mark chapter 10 mark chapter 10
[15:40] starting at verse 46
[15:42] very familiar scripture i just felt led
[15:44] to go this route
[15:45] amen and uh just talk about blind
[15:49] bartimaeus tonight amen
[15:51] and just kind of go in a little bit
[15:52] detail and sometimes we just kind of
[15:54] read skim over and
[15:56] and uh but let's let's look at
[15:59] bartimaeus's life a little bit more and
[16:01] see if we can find amen it's good that
[16:03] we look at ourselves at the through
[16:05] you know through the characters of the
[16:07] bible amen that's the reason why the
[16:09] word was written amen not just that's a
[16:11] that's a character on its own and that's
[16:13] the history of it
[16:14] but there's reasons why god put things
[16:16] in the word amen
[16:18] and so that's the reason why the word is
[16:19] a mirror amen
[16:21] so that you can look at it and then see
[16:23] yourself through that
[16:25] amen and see where you're failing see
[16:27] what you need to do
[16:28] see where what you need to to stop amen
[16:31] so so let's let's just read this verse
[16:34] 46 and they came to jericho
[16:36] and as he went out of jericho with his
[16:38] disciples and a great number of people
[16:41] blind bartimaeus the son of timaeus sat
[16:44] by the highway side begging and when he
[16:46] heard that it was
[16:48] jesus of nazareth he began to cry out
[16:50] and say
[16:51] jesus thou son of david have mercy
[16:54] on me we'll just stop right there and
[16:56] you may take your seats tonight
[17:02] okay there amen
[17:08] praise the lord amen we want to
[17:12] and we want to touch a little bit on
[17:14] faith tonight amen i'll do my best not
[17:16] not to keep you all out that's not my
[17:18] intention tonight
[17:19] i'm really trying to get you all early
[17:22] tonight
[17:24] amen so i want to title this tonight
[17:27] keep your faith on the prize amen keep
[17:30] your faith on the prize amen
[17:32] you know we hear that phrase keep your
[17:34] eyes on the prize
[17:35] amen but in this case i want you to
[17:37] think about it keep your faith
[17:39] on the prize amen because bartimaeus
[17:43] amen didn't have eyes
[17:47] he had eyes but he was blind
[17:50] all he had was faith and the faith was
[17:53] what led him to the prize
[17:56] amen and you amen tonight with eyes
[18:00] with ears with all your members intact
[18:04] and sometimes we whine and cry when
[18:07] we're supposed to have faith in god
[18:10] amen praise god amen
[18:13] so we just want to take it uh verse by
[18:16] verse you know i was reading um
[18:18] a little story about a woman named
[18:20] florence chadwick
[18:21] how many heard of florence chadwick she
[18:24] was a
[18:25] she was a swimmer in the 1940s and 1950s
[18:28] uh and she broke world records she was
[18:31] the first woman to
[18:32] swim across the english channel from uh
[18:36] from england to france and it's about 24
[18:39] miles 24 miles each one way and she swim
[18:43] it back
[18:44] so she's for whatever 24-24 is 48.
[18:47] 48 she swam 48 miles broke broke a world
[18:50] record
[18:51] and and so she decided one day that she
[18:54] was gonna swim
[18:55] from uh uh what's called there's an
[18:58] island right off the coast of california
[19:00] and they called catalina island
[19:02] and so she decided she was gonna swim
[19:04] this eye from that from that
[19:06] island to the coast of california where
[19:08] los angeles
[19:09] and all that so she started one day and
[19:12] she got in
[19:13] she started swimming and the waters if
[19:15] you get in those waters they get they're
[19:17] pretty
[19:17] chilly and so she started swimming she
[19:20] started swimming and she got to
[19:22] i don't know maybe the it's about 22
[19:24] miles from
[19:25] that island to to to the to california
[19:28] coast there
[19:29] she got to maybe the 17th 18th mile and
[19:31] she couldn't go any further
[19:33] she told the reporters they asked her
[19:34] why did you stop she said
[19:36] there was a there was a fog that came
[19:39] and she
[19:39] she didn't know where she was where she
[19:41] was going
[19:42] but they took her over to the to the
[19:45] other side to the
[19:46] to the land and so she got there but she
[19:48] decided that one day she was going to do
[19:50] it again
[19:51] and when she did it when she tried it
[19:54] again she finally she got it
[19:55] that time and they asked her and they
[19:58] said well why
[20:00] what made you what made you continue she
[20:02] said well i faced the same
[20:04] the same obstacles the same fog the same
[20:07] chilly water
[20:08] everything amen but she knew that there
[20:12] was land
[20:13] on the other side and that's what made
[20:16] her
[20:16] continue amen to pursue that goal
[20:21] amen and not only did she pursue it she
[20:23] beat the world record at that time which
[20:25] was a man by two hours
[20:29] it was because she knew that there was
[20:30] land on the other side amen
[20:33] and that's what motivates each and every
[20:34] one of us saints amen to continue
[20:36] moving forward amen above all obstacles
[20:39] above all fog of the devil
[20:41] about anything that may come into your
[20:43] life amen chilly waters
[20:45] spiritual things amen anything that
[20:48] might come into your life amen it's
[20:49] because we have a land on the other side
[20:51] amen
[20:52] we have something on the other side
[20:54] that's awaiting
[20:55] just better than every every problem
[20:58] anything that amen that
[20:59] that you can face today amen this is our
[21:03] land
[21:05] this is our land amen get that land in
[21:08] you
[21:08] praise god amen there's no obstacle amen
[21:11] that could face you amen
[21:13] oh the obstacles will come no doubt
[21:16] jesus didn't promise flowery bed of ease
[21:18] for any of his
[21:20] any of his followers as a matter of fact
[21:22] when you become a christian you sign up
[21:23] for hardships
[21:25] you sign up for for things and problems
[21:27] in your life amen
[21:29] and things that you uh uh there is there
[21:32] no way to avoid them
[21:35] but it's what you do it's your mindset
[21:36] it's your faith
[21:38] and the word that you believe amen
[21:39] that's gonna take you across you through
[21:41] that through that
[21:42] through those cold uh waters or through
[21:44] that fog amen
[21:45] because satan is blowing his poison
[21:47] breath for sure
[21:50] he's blowing his poison breath foggy
[21:52] everywhere
[21:55] uncertain times we've been facing
[21:58] uncertain times
[22:00] we've been facing things in the last
[22:01] year and a half and we don't know where
[22:02] things are going
[22:04] some say this some say that some say
[22:06] this amen but if we stay on the prize
[22:09] if we know that there's land on the
[22:10] other side amen amen then god will lead
[22:12] us through
[22:14] praise god and so in looking at this uh
[22:17] uh that example i want to to look here
[22:20] at uh blind bartimaeus and let's just
[22:23] start at verse 46 there
[22:25] and he says and they came to jericho and
[22:28] who is they it was
[22:29] jesus and his entourage right
[22:32] if you don't know what the word
[22:33] entourage means then
[22:35] yeah there you go google it yeah and his
[22:39] disciples
[22:41] and they came to jericho and as he went
[22:43] out of jericho with his disciples
[22:46] and a great number of people the bible
[22:48] says there was a lot of people there
[22:50] now jericho was one of the most popular
[22:52] cities at that time
[22:54] amen and and it was probably during this
[22:56] time that there was a i believe
[22:58] it might have been uh one of the feast
[22:59] days here and so there was probably a
[23:02] lot of people coming from a lot of from
[23:03] different areas
[23:04] amen and and there was a lot of noise
[23:07] i'm sure
[23:08] i mean you give somebody uh uh together
[23:11] in in a stadium or something like that
[23:13] there's a lot of noise you hear a lot of
[23:15] you you hear a lot of noise
[23:16] and so that's what there was it was a
[23:18] great number of people the bible says
[23:20] and blind bartimaeus the bible says
[23:22] they're the son of timaeus
[23:24] set by the side by the highway side
[23:27] begging amen he sat by the highway
[23:31] side begging amen and and it's very
[23:34] interesting that that
[23:35] it says there that uh that he was the
[23:38] son of timaeus
[23:40] usually in the bible amen when somebody
[23:42] uh when they say that they're the son of
[23:44] such and such that means that they
[23:47] they came maybe from uh from a from from
[23:50] an important type of family
[23:51] or or their family had some sort of
[23:54] influence in in in the community
[23:57] now we don't know a lot about
[23:58] bartimaeus's uh
[24:00] background we don't know a lot about his
[24:02] i mean we know some things
[24:04] brother branham mentioned some things
[24:05] regarding bartimaeus and the lamb
[24:07] uh but even him himself he says he's not
[24:09] sure if those things were true or not
[24:12] so we don't know too much about blind
[24:13] bartimaeus the only thing we know is
[24:15] that he was blind bartimaeus
[24:18] he was blind he could not see and that
[24:21] he was a beggar
[24:22] amen and and you know sometimes amen in
[24:25] our lives sayings we
[24:26] we we might be in tough situations amen
[24:29] where
[24:30] we think we don't know if there's going
[24:31] to be an out
[24:33] amen blind bartemaeus didn't know he he
[24:35] was god he just got accustomed
[24:37] to living this way amen he's got
[24:39] accustomed to living
[24:41] here's my tattered garment right here
[24:45] i'm just gonna pretend i'm blind
[24:46] bartimaeus this is all i could find
[24:48] around the house
[24:52] i'm coming back to my props again
[24:58] blind bartimaeus and all he had
[25:02] was his little garment that it's
[25:04] tattered i mean you see there's holes in
[25:06] it
[25:09] but here he was
[25:13] this is all he knew oh he knew
[25:16] let's just sit down a little bit
[25:21] arms arms
[25:28] and you know he'd hear that that that
[25:30] familiar that familiar uh
[25:32] sound you know somebody would feel sorry
[25:34] for him you know and
[25:36] and uh they would drop that you know
[25:38] that that's
[25:39] that sound of dropping coin you know not
[25:42] an eye
[25:42] airpod case that didn't have that
[25:47] but you know he'd hear that sound of of
[25:49] of of
[25:50] of coins you know and that's all he knew
[25:53] you know
[25:53] and you know what he got accustomed he
[25:55] he grew accustomed to that
[25:57] yeah he grew accustomed to this sound
[26:01] to this sound and coins dropping in
[26:03] there
[26:05] amen now i want to ask you a question
[26:08] are you accustomed to the way you're
[26:10] living
[26:14] are you accustomed to the lifestyle that
[26:16] you that you have
[26:18] amen because sometimes we have blind
[26:21] spots in our lives
[26:23] we don't see ourselves we don't see the
[26:26] problems that we have a man we
[26:28] sometimes young people especially young
[26:30] people see themselves
[26:32] through how others see them
[26:36] and that's why that's why they they want
[26:37] to you know look their best they want it
[26:40] there's a time and then you know at some
[26:42] point you just don't care anymore
[26:44] especially when you get married
[26:47] you just don't care anymore but at that
[26:49] time you know when you're young you know
[26:50] you're trying to
[26:51] find a husband trying to find a wife and
[26:53] it's all right it's no problem yeah
[26:55] and you're and you and you get you know
[26:57] you're insecure
[26:58] but you see blind bartimaeus was that
[27:00] way and all he had was just his coat you
[27:03] know
[27:04] all he had and and you know and you and
[27:07] all he had was just
[27:08] this is this was his security and he got
[27:11] accustomed to living that way
[27:13] every coin that would go in there every
[27:15] coin would just remind him and let him
[27:17] know
[27:18] this is all i have this is what i'm
[27:20] always going to be
[27:22] this is this is i'm never going to get
[27:24] out of this
[27:25] this is not how satan talks to us
[27:29] satan's talked to each and every one of
[27:30] us just like that
[27:32] amen amen and and and and
[27:35] and that coin amen comes through in your
[27:38] life
[27:38] that noise it's just satan you're not
[27:41] ever getting out of that
[27:43] you're never you're you're never getting
[27:46] married you're never going to have
[27:48] you're never going to get the holy ghost
[27:51] you're never going to get healed
[27:55] um i'm never i'm never going to get out
[27:58] of this
[27:59] situation i'm never getting out of the
[28:01] situation
[28:03] amen let's just continue reading here
[28:07] amen
[28:08] praise god and then verse 47
[28:12] and it says and when he heard that it
[28:15] was jesus
[28:16] of nazareth
[28:19] he began to cry out i want you to notice
[28:21] something here
[28:22] that it was when he heard right amen
[28:25] because remember he couldn't see
[28:29] yeah and so maybe brother branham he
[28:31] says it like this he said maybe there
[28:33] was a
[28:33] a kind little lady that told him they
[28:35] told him he might was asking who is it
[28:37] who
[28:38] what's going on something's going on he
[28:40] heard footsteps that were different
[28:43] something was different amen there was
[28:44] something in the air amen amen
[28:47] right yeah amen and he met he asked and
[28:49] somebody a little
[28:50] a kind lady might have said well that's
[28:53] jesus of nazareth he's passing by
[28:56] and you know what he's the messiah that
[28:59] that that was promised in the in the in
[29:01] in in isaiah and as soon as he heard
[29:04] that something sparked in him
[29:07] as soon as he heard that that was the
[29:09] messiah because he was jewish
[29:12] he was jew himself and he knew he was
[29:14] waiting for the messiah as well
[29:16] amen but when he heard amen that that
[29:18] was jesus of nazareth amen
[29:20] something sparked in his heart amen amen
[29:24] and the bible says here
[29:25] in verse 47 he began to cry out
[29:29] jesus thou son of david
[29:32] have mercy on me
[29:35] jesus thou son of david have mercy on me
[29:39] jesus he probably was sending him that
[29:41] cup jesus thou
[29:42] son of david have mercy on me have mercy
[29:46] on me
[29:51] because he recognized he knew he didn't
[29:53] see the messiah
[29:54] right but something told them that's the
[29:57] messiah
[29:59] amen that's the messiah i knew this
[30:02] thing was not going to stay on me
[30:04] i just
[30:11] amen
[30:15] so he began to scream jesus thou son of
[30:17] david have mercy amen amen
[30:19] amen you know what saints jesus is only
[30:22] going to pass by maybe once
[30:24] twice uh uh uh
[30:27] yeah you're right jesus you know we need
[30:30] to take advantage of the opportunities
[30:32] when jesus is passing by all right
[30:35] see blind bartimaeus he he he knew that
[30:38] he needed to take advantage of that
[30:40] opportunity
[30:41] but well i mean what what wha what was
[30:43] he gonna lose
[30:45] he was already blind all he had was a
[30:48] coat that maybe he used for a pillow
[30:50] every now and then or uh and that was
[30:52] his comfort zone
[30:55] that was his comfort zone and so what
[30:57] else is going to lose
[30:59] and start screaming jesus thou son of
[31:01] david have mercy on me amen he referred
[31:05] to him
[31:06] exactly the way he needed to refer to
[31:07] him because he was jewish
[31:10] amen right he was son of david to them
[31:13] amen and so
[31:17] he referred to him in that way so what
[31:20] he did is that he heard
[31:22] and he thought and then you know he took
[31:24] action
[31:26] he took action sometimes saints you know
[31:29] we hear and uh
[31:33] it goes in one ear and it comes out the
[31:35] other yeah
[31:37] right brother when we lease we need to
[31:40] take action
[31:41] process it you know what a thought is
[31:44] amen what is the word the being the
[31:45] beginning was the word and the word was
[31:47] with god and the word was god
[31:49] amen but before it becomes a word become
[31:52] before it becomes a word it has to be a
[31:54] thought right amen
[31:56] god amen he had his thoughts amen but
[31:58] when then he spoke them amen
[32:00] they be they became they became into
[32:02] fruition amen
[32:04] praise god and so that's exactly what
[32:06] happened with blind bartimaeus here
[32:08] remember he didn't see he could not see
[32:11] so all this was being processed in his
[32:13] head he could still hear
[32:15] he could still he could still scream he
[32:18] could steal he still had a voice
[32:20] and so everything was being processed in
[32:21] his head amen he used
[32:24] what he could use at the time he could
[32:27] not use his seeing
[32:28] he could not see but he used what he had
[32:31] available to him
[32:32] amen and that's the thing with you and i
[32:34] saying saying sometimes we think well
[32:36] i'm not a good singer
[32:38] i'm not i'm not good at this i i can't
[32:40] do that
[32:41] i'm not this amen but just use what god
[32:44] has given you what you have at the
[32:45] moment
[32:46] amen to advance to the kingdom of god to
[32:49] advance to the next level in your life
[32:51] amen
[32:52] amen to put your faith on the prize
[32:56] amen amen he heard what the prize was
[32:59] now he put his faith in action amen
[33:02] praise god
[33:04] jesus thou son of david have mercy on me
[33:07] amen then you know that the bible says
[33:09] that as a man thinketh in his heart
[33:11] so is he amen praise god
[33:15] amen he you know the bible talks about
[33:18] the day of visitation
[33:20] he didn't miss his day of visitation
[33:24] he took advantage of his day of
[33:25] visitation praise god verse 48 and it
[33:27] says and many charged him
[33:30] that he should hold his peace
[33:33] many everybody that was going by
[33:38] was probably even putting coins maybe in
[33:40] his thing to just be quiet
[33:44] coin he probably probably filled up you
[33:46] know
[33:47] so many coins he had just for him to be
[33:49] quiet he was so loud
[33:52] jesus thou son of david have mercy on me
[33:55] be quiet shut up
[34:01] don't you see the master speaking don't
[34:03] you see the master we need to be
[34:05] reverence
[34:05] oh yeah we do it at our church this way
[34:12] we don't sing like that around here we
[34:14] don't act like that around here
[34:17] we do it like this so be quiet
[34:20] but barter mess was there to get a get
[34:22] his healing he didn't care how it was
[34:23] done at church he didn't care
[34:25] what happened amen he he was waiting for
[34:27] a miracle
[34:29] he didn't care what needed to happen
[34:31] amen he was there to get his blessing
[34:33] amen
[34:34] because he already saw it he didn't see
[34:37] him physically but he saw it in his
[34:39] by faith amen praise god and so the
[34:41] bible says and man he charged him that
[34:43] he should hold his peace
[34:46] but he cried the more a great deal
[34:49] in other words his screaming got louder
[34:52] jesus thou son of david have mercy on me
[34:55] be quiet
[34:55] jesus now son of david have mercy on me
[35:00] and he kept going amen do you cry out
[35:02] like that

[35:26] that way amen
[35:28] nothing's going to happen amen all kinds
[35:31] of things that he tells each and every
[35:33] one of us
[35:34] but all you got to keep screaming is
[35:35] jesus thou son of david
[35:37] have mercy on me jesus now son of david
[35:41] hammer hang under hang in there because
[35:44] the blessing is just around the corner
[35:47] i mean jesus was already on the scene
[35:51] all you got to do is just persevere
[35:54] stand with what you got

[35:58] reading the word
[35:59] amen keep staying faithful amen amen
[36:03] because jesus is in that scene jesus is
[36:06] jesus is in sight
[36:08] no pun intended
[36:11] but he cried the more a great deal thou
[36:13] son of david have mercy on me
[36:16] amen satan satan sometimes amen he might
[36:19] use people amen to squash that faith in
[36:21] your life too
[36:23] maybe through a fence or maybe through
[36:25] something amen somebody might say
[36:27] something to you amen and it just
[36:28] deflates you
[36:29] amen you got to keep going you got to
[36:33] keep moving on amen
[36:35] praise god thank you lord young people
[36:37] sometimes amen
[36:38] god god will allow you to go through
[36:41] situations in life amen not to
[36:43] not not for you to to become a lesser
[36:46] christian
[36:46] amen not to you for you to become worse
[36:50] amen those are stepping stones for you
[36:52] to get better
[36:53] amen everything the the footsteps of the
[36:57] righteous are
[36:58] ordered by the lord the bible says right
[37:01] you believe that american amen amen
[37:06] do you know that jesus is passing by
[37:08] right or are you comfortable with the
[37:10] cup in your hand
[37:12] amen man this this reminded you this
[37:15] constantly keeps you reminding you of
[37:17] your of your problems
[37:19] amen people contributing into your life
[37:22] and
[37:22] throwing problems into your life and
[37:24] telling you satan amen he keeps
[37:26] contributing in your life
[37:28] telling you you're not getting anywhere
[37:29] you're not amen
[37:33] but jesus is on the scene brother
[37:35] branham says here
[37:37] the brothers could bring this quote up i
[37:39] like what he says he says
[37:41] in the message desperation he says
[37:43] desperation calls for a subject
[37:46] and when the subject no matter how faint
[37:49] it is it's if it's received
[37:53] it's believed right then because faith
[37:56] catches when desperation is pushing it
[38:01] i like that see and then if you mix love
[38:04] in there
[38:05] loving their mixes with it with it and
[38:08] brings it to it
[38:09] and man desperation does it and then he
[38:11] says blind bartimaeus caught that vision
[38:13] quickly amen did he want to waste any
[38:17] time he didn't care what everybody else
[38:18] was saying
[38:19] he didn't care what any everybody said
[38:22] is that all you do is just go to church
[38:24] is that all you do is just read the word
[38:26] he is that all you do amen is just pray
[38:29] amen every time i see you i find you
[38:31] reading the bible
[38:32] why aren't you why aren't you on on on
[38:34] on instagram why aren't you doing this
[38:36] that or the other amen
[38:38] it's because jesus is on the scene jesus
[38:40] came into my life amen
[38:41] jesus is in jesus is the one i'm looking
[38:44] for amen
[38:45] praise god and we look at also
[38:48] at the woman uh the woman with the issue
[38:50] of blood amen
[38:52] she had the same thing that that blind
[38:54] bottom is what else could she lose
[38:56] do you realize that in the bible there
[38:58] was nowhere written
[39:00] that if we touched the ham of his
[39:02] garment that i would be healed
[39:03] right it's not it was written it wasn't
[39:05] written anywhere in the bible
[39:07] but something amen a faith sparked in
[39:09] her amen
[39:10] that made it that cost her to say if i
[39:12] could just touch the hem of his garment
[39:15] i know that i would be healed i know
[39:17] that i would receive my blessing amen
[39:20] praise god and she just took action
[39:23] faith always puts you into action
[39:26] amen true faith amen true faith always
[39:30] puts you into action
[39:32] amen amen praise god
[39:35] let's continue in verse verse 49 and
[39:37] jesus
[39:38] watched jesus and jesus stood still
[39:42] amen amen
[39:46] and commanded him to be called
[39:51] so the people that were telling him to
[39:53] be quiet people here
[39:56] that were trying to shut him up were the
[39:59] ones that jesus used to
[40:01] to bring him to him
[40:06] was the ones that jesus used to try to
[40:08] bring him
[40:09] to jesus you see sometimes amen somebody
[40:11] might come in and bring a fence in your
[40:13] life
[40:14] but you don't understand sometimes god
[40:16] uses that person amen to bring you
[40:17] closer to god
[40:20] bring you closer to the price amen yeah
[40:24] well i don't know my brother or that
[40:26] sister offended me
[40:28] oh well yeah the bible says that there
[40:31] will be many offenses
[40:33] jesus promised that in a christian's
[40:35] life there's gonna be many offenses
[40:38] it's what you do with the offense is how
[40:40] you it's how you continue amen if you're
[40:42] gonna carry through
[40:43] and win what you what you need to get or
[40:44] not amen
[40:46] it's our attitude towards things you see
[40:49] it's our attitude and jesus stood still
[40:53] and commanded him
[40:54] commanded him so he commanded the devils
[40:59] he commands the devils to come and serve
[41:01] [Laughter]
[41:04] when they're sitting there trying to
[41:05] torment you commanded him to be called
[41:08] and they called the blind man saying
[41:09] unto him be of good comfort
[41:12] rise he calleth thee yeah so their their
[41:14] whole
[41:15] demeanor now changed because jesus said
[41:18] that you can come
[41:19] after they were berating him and telling
[41:21] boy
[41:22] we're trying to listen to the word
[41:26] now it's okay yeah jesus is calling
[41:29] jesus
[41:33] amen because when he speaks amen things
[41:36] change
[41:37] situations change amen praise god
[41:41] saying unto him be of good comfort rise
[41:43] he calleth thee
[41:45] amen praise god you know the bible the
[41:48] bible
[41:49] god allows amen he he'll make your
[41:51] enemies footstools

[41:56] stepping stones in your life amen
[41:58] praise god and watch verse 50.

[42:39] wonder well
[42:40] should i or should i not yeah doubting
[42:45] i mean he didn't even even hear jesus
[42:47] saying it
[42:49] he didn't even hear jesus's voice saying
[42:51] it amen
[42:52] he just heard the people that were
[42:54] telling him to be quiet telling him to
[42:56] shut up
[42:56] amen we're the ones that told him and he
[42:58] didn't waste any time
[43:00] amen he quickly amen he took off that
[43:02] garment and the bible says

[43:27] moving forward amen
[43:29] i am not going to lose my opportunity

[43:33] family amen
[43:34] i will receive my healing i will receive

[45:04] amen get away from that amen and just
[45:06] let him handle it he may just go to
[45:08] jesus
[45:09] just do what you're supposed to do amen
[45:11] and he will take care of the issue right
[45:13] there and there
[45:14] it could be a habit maybe it's a
[45:16] relationship
[45:18] that you're putting all hopes on amen
[45:22] and it doesn't work out let it go
[45:26] amen god has something better for you
[45:29] amen
[45:30] maybe it's a doctrine some pet doctrine
[45:33] that you just can't let go
[45:35] amen you're not gonna advance with
[45:37] christ if you don't let go
[45:39] amen maybe it's a man you know
[45:42] yeah man sometimes we put our hopes and
[45:44] trust on a man too much
[45:46] sometimes we put our hopes and trust on
[45:48] a pastor too much
[45:51] amen maybe it's your pastor yeah
[45:54] we respect our pastor we have confidence
[45:57] that he was
[45:57] he's going to see us through but he's
[45:59] not god right right
[46:01] he's not god amen or maybe he's a book
[46:04] in your life
[46:06] you see something something some
[46:08] something amen
[46:09] might be hindering you from getting up
[46:11] out of your out of your situation
[46:13] to cast that thing out and go to jesus
[46:17] amen you know what it is amen
[46:20] in verse 51 and jesus answered and said
[46:22] unto him
[46:26] what will thou that i should do unto
[46:29] thee
[46:30] now jesus knew you know that he knew
[46:32] what what was his problem
[46:35] he just passed right by him of course he
[46:38] saw what he did and of course he knew
[46:40] what he who he was
[46:43] amen jesus answered and said unto him
[46:46] what will thou that i should do unto
[46:48] thee
[46:50] in other words he wanted but he wanted
[46:52] blind barter mice to tell him
[46:54] what he wanted him to do amen sometimes
[46:56] we need to be
[46:58] detailed amen specific amen specific in
[47:01] what we want god to do in our lives
[47:04] you see oh god knows god already knows
[47:07] yeah god already knows
[47:09] but how much are you willing to invest
[47:11] amen in your time
[47:13] and your effort amen in prayer and and
[47:16] supplication amen
[47:17] and fasting yeah amen
[47:21] to really get the lord's attention the
[47:24] blind man said unto him lord
[47:26] that i might receive my sight he wasn't
[47:28] there amen he knew
[47:29] exactly what he wanted right
[47:33] verse 32 and jesus said unto him go thy
[47:35] way
[47:37] thy faith had made thee whole
[47:40] now when you look at that word uh i
[47:42] believe it's the word whole there
[47:45] is the greek word zozo
[47:48] and when you look at that greek word
[47:50] zozo it means
[47:52] physical healing but it also means
[47:55] healing of the soul
[47:56] spiritual as a spiritual healing right
[47:59] amen
[48:00] because because remember blind
[48:02] bartimaeus
[48:04] he he put jesus amen his faith amen
[48:07] turned up
[48:09] turned up because he recognized that
[48:11] that was the messiah
[48:13] that was the salvation that the jews
[48:16] were to receive in that day
[48:18] by them recognizing that that was the
[48:20] messiah but
[48:22] blind bartimaeus was was was a was a
[48:25] step up because he had never even seen
[48:27] jesus
[48:28] he had only heard about him and that
[48:31] rose his faith up
[48:33] even more and it was this was the same
[48:35] thing that jesus told the woman
[48:37] with the issue of blood why
[48:40] because it wasn't just about healing it
[48:43] was
[48:44] on who she recognized that he was
[48:48] and see blind bartimaeus he recognized
[48:51] that jesus was the messiah
[48:53] was the savior before he could recognize
[48:55] that he was his healer
[48:56] right you see and that's the reason why
[48:59] he was made whole
[49:00] amen that word zozo if you look it up in
[49:03] the greek
[49:04] and immediately he received his sight
[49:07] and watched and followed jesus in the
[49:09] way
[49:11] do you think he went back to his little
[49:12] corner do you think he went back him
[49:15] into his little cup
[49:17] i'm following jesus with my cup still
[49:20] this is how we do sometimes
[49:22] yeah jesus i'm following you
[49:26] but i still got my habit i still i still
[49:29] i still got my my problem with me i
[49:32] i can't let go i still got my pet
[49:34] doctrine from the baptist church
[49:36] i still i can't let it go yeah and jesus
[49:39] wanted you to just
[49:40] leave all that aside just let it go
[49:44] and follow let it go and just follow
[49:48] seek ye first the kingdom of god young
[49:50] people
[49:51] and all those other things that you want
[49:54] shall be added unto you
[49:57] you want a husband you want a a wife
[50:00] amen seek ye first the kingdom of god
[50:03] and his righteousness and all those
[50:06] other things shall be added unto you
[50:09] you know it wasn't it it wasn't uh
[50:12] until you get desperate with god oh god
[50:15] amen and when you mean business with god
[50:17] that god will mean business with you
[50:20] man sometimes we stay in our condition
[50:24] and we just we just this is my life this
[50:27] is how it's all going to be
[50:29] and you don't understand god has a
[50:30] greater vision a greater purpose for you
[50:32] amen
[50:33] than what you think yeah you know i it
[50:36] reminds me one time i was in lima peru
[50:38] in the country of peru and i was there
[50:41] with brother burley
[50:42] one time and uh we were in the in the in
[50:46] the in the square
[50:47] there and it was cobblestones and there
[50:49] was catholic churches
[50:51] around the area and there was one
[50:54] catholic church it was an
[50:56] old catholic church and there was a lot
[50:58] of beggars sitting around that catholic
[51:00] church that's where they
[51:01] most of the time they congregate around
[51:03] you know
[51:04] because that's how it is you know birds
[51:06] of a feather flock together
[51:08] you know the the the the the uh the ones
[51:11] who had leprosy in the in the in the
[51:13] bible
[51:13] they had to hang out together because
[51:15] they were ousted from society
[51:17] they couldn't be with society so
[51:19] therefore they hung they hung with each
[51:21] other
[51:22] a lot of beggars as well they hung out
[51:24] together
[51:25] and you see and then they feed off each
[51:27] other and that's all you're going to get
[51:30] you're feeding off of just of of your
[51:33] poor miserable situation
[51:34] and you're never going to get past that
[51:36] you're never going to advance in your
[51:38] life
[51:38] spiritually or physically if all you do
[51:41] is here
[51:42] with just the ones that that's in the
[51:44] same situation that you are
[51:45] right amen get out of your comfort zone
[51:48] amen talk with other people amen
[51:51] somebody has some
[51:52] i believe we can learn something from
[51:54] everybody
[51:56] you know it's not just for us for and no
[51:59] more we can learn
[52:00] something from everybody but we don't
[52:01] want to get out of our comfort zone
[52:04] hey we're just so happy with right with
[52:07] our tattered garment yeah amen
[52:11] i got these coins spread all over the
[52:12] place but nobody can have any
[52:15] because they're canadian coins and coins
[52:18] from nicaragua
[52:19] [Laughter]
[52:22] yes
[52:25] anyways we were there in lima peru
[52:28] and so there was all these beggars are
[52:30] sitting around the catholic church
[52:32] there and uh brother burley just really
[52:35] felt compelled
[52:36] he we looked at this one one lady an
[52:39] older lady
[52:40] i mean she she had her you know she i
[52:42] mean she was literally
[52:43] you know looked just like this you know
[52:46] just like that and you could just look
[52:48] in her eyes and you could tell that
[52:49] she's just been through a lot
[52:51] you know a lady had a rough has has seen
[52:54] some rough days and
[52:58] so brother burley just felt led he said
[53:00] uh right next to the church there was a
[53:02] mcdonald's
[53:02] believe it or not yeah mcdonald's
[53:06] right next to you know they have
[53:09] mcdonald's but when i go to lima peru or
[53:11] those kinds of countries i'm not looking
[53:12] to eat mcdonald's
[53:14] i want to eat their food i get all the
[53:16] mcdonald's here
[53:18] anyway so we went into the mcdonald's
[53:20] and ordered a
[53:21] cheeseburger i think it was something
[53:23] for that because we wanted to give her
[53:24] something to eat
[53:26] and when i went to when i went to give
[53:28] it to her brother burley
[53:30] wanted me to interpret to her something
[53:33] i went to give it to her
[53:35] and she literally she pushed it away she
[53:37] pushed it aside
[53:38] she got up and ran and ran away from us
[53:42] she didn't want it and you know what
[53:45] happened the other beggars that were
[53:46] around they're like yeah we're taking
[53:47] that
[53:48] and they started they started fighting
[53:50] for the for the for the bag
[53:51] yeah and they took it and i thought
[53:55] brother burly and me we just looked at
[53:56] each other and i thought my goodness
[53:58] here you are you want to go help
[54:00] somebody
[54:02] and they're so they're so accustomed to
[54:05] their situation
[54:07] to their condition that when help comes
[54:10] along the way they don't want to receive
[54:12] it because it looks
[54:14] it doesn't look the way they think it
[54:16] needs to look right
[54:17] it looks totally different they think it
[54:20] needs to come a certain way
[54:22] then i'll receive it and what they
[54:24] needed at that moment
[54:26] came totally different she needed some
[54:29] food she needed some help
[54:30] but she didn't want it the way we wanted
[54:32] to give it to her yeah
[54:33] it was the same thing i had to mention
[54:35] last time when i preached the same thing
[54:36] with the jewish people amen
[54:38] they wanted the messiah but they didn't
[54:40] want to receive it the way god sent it
[54:41] to him
[54:42] and a lot of them missed their blessing
[54:44] their visitation for their day
[54:47] but not blind bartimaeus not blind
[54:50] but but the priests in the in the temple
[54:52] he missed the visitation
[54:54] amen but a blind beggar amen on the side
[54:56] of the road amen
[54:58] who never seen jesus christ physically
[55:00] he got his
[55:01] he what he was looking for amen
[55:04] and the lady just ran i thought what a
[55:07] sad situation
[55:08] i wonder if if us spiritually amen if
[55:11] that's how we are
[55:13] we need help we need somebody to come
[55:15] minister the word to us do something say
[55:17] something to us
[55:18] do something and it comes and you're
[55:21] like
[55:21] i don't know yeah that's not what i was
[55:23] looking for
[55:26] god can't do anything else for you i i
[55:29] wasn't going to go down brother
[55:30] brilliant me wasn't going to go down and
[55:31] chase after that lady
[55:33] that's what she wanted to do yeah
[55:35] brother dale
[55:36] all he can do is preach the word the
[55:39] minister's here all we can do is preach
[55:41] the word
[55:42] you decide what you want to do with the
[55:43] word it's up to you
[55:46] amen all we do is throw the net praise
[55:49] god
[55:49] brother amen what a sad situation it is
[55:53] that people don't want to leave their
[55:54] situation amen you know in
[55:56] in in the bible if uh
[56:00] it looks like this this same scenario is
[56:02] in luke if you read in luke you can also
[56:04] read in luke chapter 18
[56:06] verses 35 through 43. that was blind
[56:09] bartimaeus says well we're not going to
[56:10] read it it's the same thing but
[56:11] i like what it says there the last verse
[56:14] after jesus
[56:15] gave him his his sight in verse 42 the
[56:18] brothers could scroll up
[56:20] it says it says and jesus said unto him
[56:22] receive thy sight thy faith hath saved
[56:25] thee
[56:26] and verse 43 says and immediately he
[56:27] received his sight
[56:29] and followed him glorifying god
[56:32] and all the people when they saw it gave
[56:35] praise unto god
[56:37] amen amen so all the people that were
[56:41] persecuting him all the people were
[56:42] telling to be quiet
[56:44] they got all nice and then when they saw
[56:46] the miracle
[56:47] they all began to praise god amen you
[56:50] might be going through a problem in your
[56:52] life
[56:52] somebody said something that maybe you
[56:54] didn't like amen but eventually it's all
[56:56] for the glory of god
[56:58] amen it's all to bring glory to and
[57:00] praise unto god amen
[57:03] it's all for his glory amen praise the
[57:05] lord
