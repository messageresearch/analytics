[8:51] the lord is the strength of my life of
[8:54] whom
[8:54] shall i be afraid

[9:12] though in hosts should encamp against me
[9:15] my heart shall not fear

[9:35] in the house of the lord all the days of
[9:38] my life

[9:43] all the days of my life and this was
[9:46] david in the old testament without the
[9:49] holy ghost
[9:51] wanting to dwell not just in a physical
[9:55] temple
[9:56] but to be in the presence of the lord 24
[9:59] 7.
[10:00] i don't know of any christian who would
[10:02] not want to be in that presence amen
[10:03] exactly
[10:05] all the days of my life to behold the
[10:07] beauty of the lord and to inquire
[10:09] in his temple for in the time of trouble
[10:12] he shall hide me in his pavilion
[10:14] and the secret of his tabernacle shall
[10:17] he hide me
[10:18] he shall set me upon a rock
[10:22] we know that rock is christ and now
[10:24] shall my
[10:25] head be lifted up above mine enemies
[10:28] round about me therefore will i offer in

[13:36] a
[13:37] the tv that you have in your house it

[14:03] ghost to have a desire for god
[14:04] amen that is something great how much
[14:07] more with you and i am with the holy

[14:26] the things of god you are blessed
[14:28] amen not many people out here feel that
[14:30] way not many people out here don't even
[14:33] know what men
[14:33] they just know that they need to be at
[14:35] church they've went to church they know
[14:37] that there's a bible
[14:38] it's got dust all over it amen they
[14:40] might pick it up amen maybe on mother's
[14:42] day

[14:45] on easter
[14:46] amen but you are blessed amen if you are
[14:49] in the word day
[14:50] 24 7. now that's not saying amen that
[14:54] you read the word amen sleeping or
[14:56] anything like that amen but the word is
[14:58] in your mind
[14:59] consistently amen that is that is that
[15:02] is wanting to be with god amen
[15:04] david said this one thing amen have i
[15:06] desired of the lord and that will i seek
[15:08] after
[15:09] amen and it reminds me of the of what
[15:12] jesus said amen that you will
[15:14] if you seek you will find
[15:18] knock and it shall be opened unto you
[15:20] amen
[15:21] the problem is is that we don't seek
[15:25] or if we do we seek very very very
[15:28] laxadaisic if that's a word amen
[15:32] what have you lost something important
[15:33] in your life amen something
[15:35] i've lost my wallet amen i've lost uh
[15:37] i've lost different i've lost important
[15:39] things
[15:40] amen i was not i was like well i lost my
[15:43] wallet and
[15:44] it's got to be somewhere i'll see if it
[15:47] comes to me maybe i'll find it in the
[15:49] yellow pages or in a google search
[15:52] i'll find the wallet no i started
[15:54] seeking that thing
[15:55] i started looking for that thing that
[15:57] thing was important that thing had
[15:58] documents amen that i didn't want
[16:00] anybody else to see or
[16:01] get a hold of amen that thing was
[16:03] important to me amen and to david amen
[16:05] being in the presence of god was
[16:07] important amen
[16:08] it was it was important that he said
[16:09] that one thing will i seek after amen
[16:12] to be in the presence of god amen
[16:15] every single time he had the opportunity
[16:17] to to be in that presence amen
[16:19] he was going to be right there amen and
[16:22] if that one thing amen if christ
[16:23] and and god if it's important to you
[16:26] you're going to do whatever it takes to
[16:27] be in that presence
[16:28] you're going to be whatever you're going
[16:29] to do whatever you have to do amen to be
[16:31] in that presence amen because it's
[16:33] important to you amen
[16:35] amen and the thing is is you know if we
[16:38] seek something if we lost something
[16:39] let's say you lost a wedding band or you
[16:41] lost a
[16:42] an important ring or something that that
[16:44] maybe was passed down to your family
[16:46] maybe you you saw after it but maybe you
[16:48] might not find it
[16:50] but you at least you sought it right
[16:52] right amen but the thing is with jesus
[16:54] amen
[16:55] when you seek you are gonna find
[16:58] when you seek with jesus you you will
[17:00] find
[17:01] otherwise he'd make him a liar amen he
[17:04] said seek
[17:04] and you shall find knock and it shall be
[17:08] opened unto you
[17:09] amen and we're wondering amen why is god
[17:11] not in my in my life why
[17:13] i don't see things happening in my life
[17:14] why isn't that things
[17:16] are not taking place in my life are you
[17:17] really seeking the way you should be
[17:19] seeking
[17:20] is that one thing more important to you
[17:22] than amen go and get subway amen at two
[17:24] o'clock or before two o'clock
[17:26] yeah right right oh man we got we got to
[17:28] hurry up and finish service amen because
[17:30] subway amen
[17:30] you know they're waiting for us you know
[17:33] is that more important to you
[17:36] than the presence of god then when the
[17:38] holy spirit is moving in our midst
[17:41] amen the subway ain't going anywhere
[17:43] taco bell's not going anywhere amen but
[17:45] the presence of the lord
[17:46] amen amen he's he's timid amen he's
[17:49] timid and he might that might be your
[17:50] only chance amen to get a hold of god
[17:52] amen if you don't get a hold of god
[17:54] right then amen
[17:55] you might not have another opportunity
[17:57] so so why do we rush these things
[18:00] don't you understand that sometimes we
[18:02] hinder the spirit of god
[18:04] by rushing amen one thing have i desired
[18:08] amen
[18:09] and with jesus christ if you seek you
[18:10] will find right
[18:12] period knock
[18:16] and he shall open unto you this is what
[18:19] he promised
[18:21] but are we doing it with our whole heart
[18:23] well without
[18:24] our heart is it that important to us
[18:26] amen
[18:27] praise god is it important for us amen
[18:30] to
[18:31] really be in the house of god or is it
[18:34] you know just every now and then it's
[18:35] okay
[18:37] every now and then i pick up the bible
[18:39] it's all right every now and then i lift
[18:41] up my hands amen it's okay
[18:43] god amen or are you really seeking
[18:47] that's right because when you seek you
[18:49] will find
[18:51] that's what he said right there's no
[18:53] doubt about it you will find when you
[18:55] see
[18:55] amen praise god i want you to keep that
[18:58] thought in mind
[18:58] amen seek and you shall find knock and
[19:01] it shall be opened unto you this is a
[19:03] simple thought tonight amen but
[19:04] sometimes you know we get into these
[19:06] ruts amen in our lives amen
[19:09] let me tell you what saints
[19:13] i just you know confession is a is is
[19:15] good for the soul
[19:18] amen and during this year amen i've
[19:22] i've i've felt like i've just been i've
[19:24] been in a rut
[19:26] and i got into a point where i just
[19:28] wasn't praying like i should i wasn't
[19:30] meditating like i should i wasn't amen
[19:33] and it's not that i had you know i
[19:35] wanted to go serve the devil and
[19:36] anything like that no no nothing like
[19:38] that amen it's just sometimes you get
[19:40] into this point amen that
[19:42] i've got it figured out and and and you
[19:44] know i understand different things and
[19:47] uh
[19:47] you know god has revealed the word to me
[19:49] and man and then you get laxed
[19:53] and that's a dangerous point to be in
[19:54] saints
[19:56] that is a dangerous point that's the
[19:57] reason why amen i appreciate their
[19:59] ministry that we have here
[20:00] but it can be dangerous to you if you're
[20:02] not careful
[20:04] it can be seriously dangerous because we
[20:06] get so laxed in this hour
[20:08] we get so comfortable a man so
[20:10] comfortable that we lean over to the
[20:12] wall
[20:12] amen and we just fall asleep put that
[20:15] blanket on us amen
[20:17] i already know about daniel 70 weeks i
[20:19] already know these things
[20:21] i've got everything that i need amen
[20:24] we're going to see here the rich young
[20:26] ruler amen in just a moment we're going
[20:28] to talk about him amen
[20:29] you're on dangerous ground when you take
[20:31] that attitude when you come to church
[20:32] saints
[20:33] amen and what happens is that you become
[20:36] critical
[20:36] and you become a man sour and you become
[20:40] a man a wrinkled face amen everything
[20:43] makes you angry
[20:44] everything that everybody does amen or
[20:46] wherever people go amen
[20:48] it makes you upset yeah right amen
[20:50] somebody goes to some youth camp or
[20:52] something like that
[20:53] why are they doing that amen why are
[20:56] they go
[20:59] amen we just become so sour and so amen
[21:02] don't you understand that you hinder
[21:04] your walk with god amen
[21:06] praise god now i was getting like that
[21:09] throughout this year
[21:10] amen now i said and
[21:13] and the other last last wednesday this
[21:15] is just in the form of testimony
[21:17] last thursday i got up and i just really
[21:19] couldn't sleep so i got up already i
[21:21] woke up around 4
[21:22] 4 15 in the morning and i've just had a
[21:25] burden for my children
[21:26] amen i said lord i want you to do
[21:28] something for them
[21:30] and of course what parents would not
[21:32] want amen their for their for god to
[21:34] do something for their kids amen i don't
[21:37] know
[21:37] any parent that you would not want amen
[21:39] for their children to have the holy
[21:41] ghost
[21:41] amen i don't want to have any parent who
[21:44] would not want their children amen to be
[21:46] further their walk with god amen amen
[21:49] i don't know about you that's the case
[21:51] that's what i want amen that's what my
[21:53] parents wanted for me
[21:54] amen and to this day if it wasn't for
[21:56] their prayers if it wasn't for
[21:57] for for them amen sitting down with me

[27:42] that's eternity praise the lord
[27:45] the one thing that i desired most said
[27:48] david amen that's that one thing amen
[27:50] that i'm seeking after
[27:51] amen seek and you shall find amen knock
[27:54] and it shall be opened unto you amen
[27:57] praise god
[27:58] you know we look at the rich young ruler
[28:01] amen he came to jesus and he said lord
[28:04] he said he the bible says that he
[28:05] actually went running to jesus
[28:07] and he said he's and he kneeled to jesus
[28:10] the bible says
[28:11] that means he was really seeking he was
[28:13] really sincere in what he wanted
[28:15] he said if i can have how is it that i
[28:18] can obtain
[28:19] eternal life and jesus amen
[28:22] knowing that he knew all things he
[28:24] starts asking him hey have you kept the
[28:26] commandments
[28:27] i've done this with all my life from my
[28:29] youth he said
[28:31] he wasn't a bad person and maybe he
[28:34] obtained
[28:35] uh some of his riches amen by uh maybe
[28:38] it was an inheritance maybe he was a
[28:39] hard worker
[28:40] and worked hard in his life and obtained
[28:43] those things amen nothing wrong with
[28:44] that
[28:45] he was a blessed man right and now he
[28:48] wanted eternal life because he knew that
[28:50] eternal life could not
[28:51] there was no way to obtain eternal life
[28:53] amen in the current sacrificing of
[28:56] sheep and goats and things like that
[28:57] amen there was a salvation amen but he
[29:00] wanted eternal life and he knew that
[29:01] through jesus christ
[29:03] there was an eternal life amen there was
[29:05] something that he could obtain beyond in
[29:07] what he just had
[29:09] and jesus said did you keep the
[29:10] commandments and he said i've done this
[29:12] from my youth up
[29:14] and you know what jesus says he says one
[29:16] thing
[29:18] one thing that thou lackest amen now it
[29:21] was that one thing that david was
[29:23] sinking after
[29:26] amen it was the one thing that the that
[29:28] the rich young ruler we lacked
[29:30] right and jesus amen went to the root of
[29:32] the problem
[29:33] right yep now let me ask you this amen
[29:36] what is that one thing that is hindering
[29:38] your life
[29:40] you know what it is and god definitely
[29:43] knows what it is
[29:45] is it prayer is it really being sincere
[29:48] about
[29:49] about coming and to church serving god
[29:52] or is it something in your household
[29:54] that's hindering amen
[29:57] what is it only you know and definitely
[30:00] as i said god knows
[30:02] and jesus came into the root of the
[30:04] issue and he said one thing thou lackest
[30:06] amen sell everything that you have and
[30:09] give it to the poor
[30:10] oh my he touched him exactly where he
[30:14] needed to be touched him
[30:16] he got to the root of the problem right
[30:18] amen
[30:19] now i believe jesus knew how he was
[30:21] going to respond
[30:23] now i've picked weeds and things like
[30:24] that out in my yard and
[30:26] and and and things like that and and
[30:28] done
[30:29] yard work and and when you're picking
[30:31] weeds hey man you get
[30:33] you get to some some really stubborn
[30:35] ones sometimes
[30:37] and you can't you can't pull that thing
[30:38] and some of them they just come out nice
[30:40] and easy
[30:41] for the root and everything but some of
[30:43] them they are stubborn
[30:45] amen and you know you're right there and
[30:48] maybe you start by cutting the stalk a
[30:50] little bit kind of getting in the
[30:51] in the leaves a little bit so that you
[30:53] can get closer down to the root
[30:55] that's what jesus was doing when he was
[30:57] asking him have you kept the
[30:58] commandments
[30:59] have you done have you done this that he
[31:01] was cutting down a little bit of that
[31:02] stalk amen cut down a little bit
[31:04] of that of those leaves and things
[31:06] coming down to the root
[31:07] right exposed the root for him and it
[31:10] was up to him amen to do something about
[31:12] that route
[31:14] it was up to it was up to the richer
[31:16] jesus wasn't going to do it for him
[31:19] jesus was not going to do it for you
[31:21] just like he will not do it for you amen
[31:23] there's a part that you've got to do
[31:25] he's exposed it amen sometimes he
[31:28] exposes it through the preaching of the
[31:29] word
[31:30] sometimes he exposes it to a sermon of
[31:32] brother branham sometimes he exposes it
[31:34] through the word amen but you've the one
[31:36] who's got to change
[31:39] he can't do it for you amen
[31:42] and you get to that root amen and
[31:44] sometimes
[31:46] and you know it and it's really thick
[31:48] and it's really uh
[31:50] gross and milky stuff is coming out of
[31:53] it and things like that
[31:55] and you know you're like man i'm already
[31:57] tired i'm gonna leave this thing alone
[32:00] and you watch in a few weeks that thing
[32:03] will be growing back
[32:04] up and probably even bigger than what it
[32:05] was when you first found it
[32:07] amen and jesus got to the root of the
[32:10] issue with the
[32:11] rich young ruler and it was up to him to
[32:13] change that and what does the bible say
[32:15] the bible says that he got sad he got
[32:18] upset
[32:20] jesus was there showing him exactly what
[32:22] he needed to do
[32:23] preaching the gospel to him and he got
[32:25] upset he got
[32:26] so like some of us get sometimes
[32:31] i can't believe he's telling me amen
[32:34] he's up there meddling yeah
[32:37] i like what brother brother uh aaron was
[32:39] talking yet last
[32:40] wednesday man and i said hey if you need
[32:42] the medal if it's the truth meddle away
[32:45] meddle away if it's the truth because if
[32:46] the truth amen
[32:48] the meddling stumps on my toes it makes
[32:50] me change amen i want to
[32:52] keep meddling amen if it's the word keep
[32:54] meddling
[32:56] if you don't like meddling then
[32:58] something's wrong then
[33:01] if meddling is the truth amen it's not
[33:04] meddling
[33:07] it's the truth and jesus christ is truth
[33:11] amen but you see the rich young ruler
[33:14] amen the bible says
[33:16] it says in in uh in mark mark chapter 10
[33:20] it says and he was sad at that saying
[33:23] and went away
[33:24] grieved for he had great possessions
[33:27] when it's when it's put when it's put
[33:29] before you what you need to do
[33:30] in order to get come to that extra that
[33:33] next step with god
[33:34] and you don't want to do it amen there's
[33:36] a problem with you
[33:41] i just let that marinate in your in your
[33:44] soul
[33:46] you see the solution you know what you
[33:48] got to do
[33:49] and you don't want to do it there's a
[33:51] problem there's a spiritual issue
[33:53] there's something that you don't want to
[33:54] let go or that you're so comfortable
[33:58] either that or your mind is seared
[34:02] i hope that none of us have come to that
[34:03] point that you
[34:05] that your mind is seared that you're so
[34:07] comfortable with just coming to church
[34:09] and being here amen and and
[34:12] that that is a dangerous point to be
[34:15] rich young ruler did not obtain what he
[34:17] came after
[34:20] jesus clearly told him he said one thing
[34:22] thou lackest go thy way
[34:23] sell whatsoever thou has and give to the
[34:25] poor and thou
[34:26] shalt have treasure in heaven amen
[34:29] that's the eternal life that he was
[34:30] seeking after
[34:32] that was the eternal life that he was
[34:34] seeking after he told him how to obtain
[34:36] eternal life
[34:37] and he didn't like it the way it came he
[34:38] thought that he was going to give him a
[34:40] checklist to do
[34:41] all right now you've done the two
[34:42] commandments now you do this and then
[34:44] you do this
[34:44] and then you do this amen or give him
[34:46] some secret formula you know like some
[34:48] of us when we're reading you know these
[34:50] uh motivational speakers and these
[34:52] things like that the secret formula amen
[34:54] to
[34:55] uh to to not fall asleep you know in
[34:58] church
[35:00] or whatever yeah we need to find it yes
[35:05] absolutely the secret formula amen
[35:08] steps one two two and three amen to do
[35:11] this that or the other obtain a million
[35:12] in a year
[35:14] you know and that's what the rich and
[35:16] ruler thought that he was going to give
[35:17] him
[35:18] he gave him something totally different
[35:20] jesus always surprised us
[35:21] jesus always gives us everything totally
[35:24] contrary to what you think is going to
[35:26] be
[35:26] even his birth was that way totally
[35:29] contrary to what the
[35:30] uh the pharisees thought messiah was
[35:33] gonna be
[35:33] totally contrary to what the people
[35:35] thought it was gonna be they read it in
[35:36] the word
[35:37] they saw it in the word and they got it
[35:39] in their mind that it had to be that way
[35:40] but when it came totally different amen
[35:42] they could not receive it
[35:44] that's not the messiah that's not what
[35:46] we read in the bible
[35:48] and it was exactly what they needed now
[35:51] what about you and i saints
[35:53] amen when you there's something in your
[35:55] life amen and god is calling and tugging
[35:58] and pulling at that exact root amen and
[36:00] yeah no that can't be god
[36:02] that can't be god that that's not god
[36:05] amen and he's tugging amen he's pulling
[36:07] amen
[36:08] amen but at one point amen he's exposing
[36:10] but at some point he's going to leave it
[36:12] alone
[36:14] he's not going to deal with you always
[36:16] right bible says that he will not always
[36:17] strive with man
[36:19] he will not always strive with you amen
[36:22] today is the day of salvation
[36:24] the bible doesn't say tomorrow it says
[36:26] today
[36:27] do it while you can right now amen
[36:31] do it while you have the opportunity you
[36:33] got up at four in the morning
[36:35] pray while you have the opportunity it's
[36:37] quiet
[36:38] it's nice and quiet amen have a burden
[36:40] for your children
[36:42] not just have a burden amen so they make
[36:44] it through school and
[36:45] and do extracurricular things and be
[36:48] number one
[36:49] this and that and the other amen to get
[36:51] the holy ghost amen i'd rather get the
[36:53] holy ghost and
[36:54] they'd be homeless all their life amen
[36:56] but they got the holy ghost
[36:59] i'd rather get the holy ghost amen
[37:02] amen i feel i'll feel
[37:05] i would feel happy amen but i know that
[37:08] god will take care of everything else
[37:10] amen
[37:11] when the holy ghost when they put god
[37:12] first amen god will take care of the
[37:14] financials god will take care of
[37:16] everything else amen but when you put
[37:17] work
[37:18] before god young people and when you put
[37:20] school before god
[37:21] when you put extracurricular things
[37:23] before god amen
[37:24] something is wrong with you spiritually
[37:27] there's no
[37:28] there's no doubt about it something is
[37:30] wrong with you spiritually and you need
[37:33] an experience with god
[37:36] amen praise god
[37:39] i promise that i promised i wasn't going
[37:41] to be long tonight amen
[37:43] let's look at uh let's look at another
[37:45] example
[37:47] amen let's look at martha and mary
[37:51] amen i mean you know that story of
[37:52] martha and mary
[37:54] man in luke chapter 10 jesus one day
[37:58] he came to uh to bethany i think is
[38:02] that the place where they were at where
[38:04] they lived and
[38:05] and he came to them and he wanted to
[38:07] come visit lazarus martha and mary amen
[38:10] the bible says that they were his
[38:12] friends so he wanted to go visit them
[38:14] amen he wanted he he might
[38:16] might have not gave him a text message
[38:18] before he got there you know
[38:20] he just stopped by by surprise you know
[38:22] it was a surprise visit you know
[38:24] because he loved them the bible says
[38:25] that he loved him and and they must have
[38:27] loved jesus as well
[38:28] right amen he didn't send them any word
[38:31] amen it was totally different
[38:33] from uh the way jesus reacted amen when
[38:35] simon the pharisee invited him to his
[38:37] home
[38:38] you see jesus doesn't automatically go
[38:40] to somebody's house
[38:41] amen uh uh uh that he
[38:44] doesn't really uh he's not welcomed that
[38:47] amen that's not where he's going to show
[38:49] up
[38:52] but he knew that he would be welcomed
[38:53] here and so he went there amen
[38:56] but it was different with simon thank
[38:58] you man the the the pharisee
[39:00] simon got to send out the invitation
[39:02] come
[39:03] get jesus then jesus went jesus always
[39:05] keeps his invitations
[39:07] jesus always keeps his promises amen
[39:11] it's not like some of us amen sometimes

[39:49] what a what a surprise
[39:51] oh my you know what she was ready to
[39:53] receive him amen
[39:55] and she and it's like some of us saints
[39:58] amen you know
[39:59] when we first come to the to the word
[40:01] amen we're excited about this word amen
[40:03] jesus comes into our lives amen we're
[40:05] happy we're excited amen there's nothing
[40:07] that you would not do amen
[40:09] you definitely come early to church you
[40:11] definitely come
[40:12] amen uh to get make sure the tape is
[40:15] playing amen to get the tape
[40:16] you you make sure that you read every
[40:18] morning before you go to work you make
[40:20] sure that you pray
[40:21] every night before you go to bed you do
[40:23] everything that you need to do amen
[40:25] because you're excited about god
[40:28] and unfortunately many of us have lost
[40:29] that excitement
[40:31] now you know if we pray or not
[40:35] it's okay before we go to bed i'm just
[40:38] too tired
[40:39] you read the word of god i'll i'll i'll
[40:42] get it when i come to church wednesday
[40:45] oh yeah that's enough word for me
[40:48] jesus will take whatever you give him
[40:52] but i promise you that's all you'll get
[40:54] whatever you give him
[40:56] right amen martha was excited to see
[40:58] jesus amen
[40:59] and so we know the story jesus walks in
[41:01] amen and
[41:02] martha probably told him sit down let me
[41:05] start making things
[41:06] ready for you hey man she started going
[41:07] in the kitchen and she started cooking
[41:09] amanda
[41:10] the the the eggs and she started frying
[41:13] the bacon she started making the
[41:14] biscuits amen
[41:15] i don't know it might have been
[41:16] breakfast time i don't know hey man she
[41:18] started cooking the hash browns she
[41:20] started cooking maybe she even had some
[41:21] fried okra i don't know
[41:23] you know but she got busy
[41:27] she wanted to serve the lord now a lot
[41:29] of people you know they
[41:30] they see martha as like she's like the
[41:33] the
[41:34] the the bad one you know and that she's
[41:36] martha was not a bad person
[41:39] martha loved jesus martha was so
[41:42] was was so in love with the lord and
[41:45] knew that that was
[41:46] well that was god amen that was just not
[41:48] any other man that was god amen
[41:51] and she knew that that so much that she
[41:54] wanted to serve him
[41:55] amen but that was her problem
[42:04] later we see mary you know she's there
[42:07] cooking you martha martha's there
[42:08] cooking and doing the things and
[42:10] and mary all of a sudden you know starts
[42:13] getting down you know martha's probably
[42:15] thinking hey mary's going to come over
[42:17] here and help me
[42:18] and things but then as she's there
[42:19] cooking and and making the cake
[42:21] putting the turkey in the oven whatever
[42:23] she was doing she looks over the window
[42:25] the little
[42:26] the little window there in the kitchen a
[42:27] man facing the the living room area and
[42:30] she sees mary
[42:31] amen sitting down
[42:34] listening at the feet of jesus amen
[42:38] oh my i wish i was there
[42:41] you know the bible doesn't show what
[42:43] jesus was telling her amen or what he
[42:45] was saying at the moment
[42:46] amen but i wish i was there amen i wish
[42:49] i would have been
[42:49] there you know just listening uh uh and
[42:52] mary was enthralled with
[42:54] with what jesus was saying amen she
[42:56] probably i mean she's like lord
[42:57] i know you're god amen and i got to take
[42:59] this opportunity
[43:00] amen to hear what you have to say and
[43:02] she was there just listening and she was
[43:04] there and jesus was probably there just
[43:06] smiling at her
[43:07] and and saying different things talking
[43:09] you know and and she was just there
[43:10] listen she probably had her mouth open
[43:16] sometimes some of us have our mouth open
[43:18] but with our eyes closed
[43:24] i'm listening
[43:28] but she was enthralled with what and
[43:29] then oh god i can't i can't
[43:31] that i got i got to take advantage of
[43:33] this time i got to tell you oh my
[43:35] oh why are you saying they're what he's
[43:37] saying and then all of a sudden martha
[43:38] comes in here
[43:39] jesus interrupts the whole thing
[43:44] interrupts how sometimes we do amen when
[43:46] the spirit is working
[43:49] jesus it's time to go to subway
[43:55] we got service at two we got this that
[43:58] and the other we got to go
[44:01] amen jesus tell mary to come and help me
[44:06] she probably she probably snapped that
[44:08] neck back into him
[44:09] you better tell him to go and bear tell
[44:12] her go in there and help me
[44:15] and you and the thing is saying says is
[44:17] that martha
[44:18] ma martha was not wrong amen she we need
[44:21] a lot more martha's in in
[44:22] in life amen because sometimes if we
[44:24] don't have martha's in life things don't
[44:26] get done
[44:29] some some of us say man we're so uh so
[44:32] passive about things
[44:33] too uh you know that we're like hippie
[44:36] sometimes yeah whatever happens yeah
[44:41] oh yeah please
[44:45] but martha she knew how to get things
[44:47] done she reminds me brother wade
[44:50] [Laughter]
[44:55] that's a good thing if we didn't have
[44:57] brother wade like that or
[44:58] you know some of these brothers hey man
[45:00] who take action amen some of us will be
[45:02] like when the world's going on around
[45:03] here you know
[45:05] we need them amen but we also need
[45:07] mary's that's right
[45:09] yes we also need mary's
[45:12] mary was right there and martha just
[45:15] interrupted the whole thing
[45:16] and and and and watch what jesus tells
[45:18] us
[45:20] he said lord verse 40 and luke chapter
[45:23] 10 verse 40. but martha was cumbered
[45:25] about
[45:26] much serving and came to him and said
[45:28] lord does thou not
[45:30] care that service is going to start at
[45:32] two o'clock
[45:33] and uh you know and you don't care about
[45:36] that
[45:38] you don't care amen that that my sister
[45:40] has left me to serve alone
[45:44] bit her therefore that she helps me amen
[45:47] in other words you know
[45:48] you tell her and she felt like she was
[45:50] right
[45:52] she was standing right there next to
[45:54] jesus looking down at her
[45:55] and mary was probably like lord
[46:00] i'm in i'm and you watch what jesus says
[46:02] and jesus answered and said unto her
[46:04] martha martha
[46:05] let me tell you what when jesus calls
[46:07] your name twice
[46:09] he's about to say something
[46:13] he's about to say something you know
[46:18] martha martha dark careful and troubled
[46:21] about many things
[46:24] in other words you are so concerned
[46:26] about all these externals
[46:28] that you're forgetting that i'm here
[46:30] right now
[46:31] in other words you're so concerned about
[46:34] about
[46:34] serving me and forgetting to be with me
[46:40] and isn't that how we are sometimes
[46:42] we're so concerned about
[46:44] this that and the other that has to do
[46:45] with god that has to do with with the
[46:47] church and it has to do
[46:48] and we forget that jesus is on the scene
[46:52] we forget to be in his presence we
[46:54] forget to be with jesus
[46:56] in order to serve jesus
[47:00] martha martha dark careful and troubled
[47:02] about many things
[47:04] the turkey's gonna not gonna burn turkey
[47:07] will be fine but one thing is needful
[47:12] that one thing see it's that one thing
[47:14] that's hindering you
[47:16] and hindering me god knows what it is
[47:19] and you know what it is
[47:20] one thing is needful there's only one
[47:22] thing saints amen all those things are
[47:24] fine
[47:25] amen extracurricular things they're fine
[47:29] your business that's fine you need to
[47:32] feed your family
[47:33] your farm whatever it is amen that's all
[47:35] fine but
[47:36] only one thing is needed one thing is
[47:39] needful and mary hath chosen that good
[47:41] part
[47:43] and we shall not be taken away from her
[47:45] right
[47:46] jesus jesus didn't say i'm not gonna
[47:48] take this away from her
[47:50] and jesus didn't rebuke martha either
[47:52] for for for doing what she was doing
[47:55] that was good i'm glad that you are
[47:57] doing that for me praise god
[47:59] but the word takes the preeminence the
[48:02] spirit takes the preeminence
[48:04] amen martha you're encumbered by
[48:06] mechanics amen
[48:07] but you need to be also mindful of the
[48:09] dynamics as well
[48:11] amen martha you're encumbered amen with
[48:13] all these things amen but you need to be
[48:15] a man also mindful of the of the spirit
[48:18] moving
[48:19] amen praise god amen
[48:22] amen brother don you know about
[48:24] mechanics and things like that and some
[48:26] of these brothers they know about
[48:27] mechanics amen
[48:28] and if you you have you can shine and
[48:30] polish mechanics amen
[48:32] but if it doesn't have gas in it and if
[48:34] it doesn't have
[48:35] some form of combustion in order to to
[48:38] fire up the gas to make those mechanics
[48:40] and pistons move and things like that
[48:42] that that car is not worth anything
[48:45] what's the point of having a car that
[48:47] can't run with shiny tires
[48:49] shiny fenders and shiny everything amen
[48:52] brand new
[48:52] 2019 2020 2021 whatever it may be
[48:56] but it can't run i don't need a car like
[48:58] that
[48:59] it just takes up space amen but with god
[49:02] amen
[49:02] with with god amen you need to have him
[49:06] and you want to obtain something from
[49:07] god amen
[49:08] it's not just about the mechanics saints
[49:10] that's why i said amen it could be
[49:12] dangerous amen
[49:13] for you to just be so relaxed
[49:17] i know these things i i've heard them 40
[49:20] years
[49:21] i i know them and then you don't
[49:24] recognize the moving of the holy spirit
[49:26] right to you you're afraid of it to you
[49:29] you're scared
[49:30] amen to you amen a young person or
[49:33] something like that gets excited about
[49:35] god
[49:37] we talk about the baptists doing that
[49:39] and man some of us we do the exact same
[49:40] thing
[49:41] that's right somebody gets excited about
[49:43] god
[49:45] we don't do that in this church yeah
[49:48] that's the reason why we don't move
[49:50] sometimes because we don't do that in
[49:52] this church
[49:54] we don't do that in this church amen
[49:57] praise god you know whatever environment
[50:00] you put an egg in that's how it's going
[50:01] to hatch you know
[50:05] you put an egg under a cold environment
[50:07] amen it ain't going to hatch
[50:09] you put an egg under a warm and hot
[50:11] environment it'll hatch
[50:14] break out hallelujah praise god amen
[50:18] amen get under the environment of the
[50:19] word and the preaching and the
[50:21] in some shape some shouting and dancing
[50:23] and stuff like that amen
[50:25] that starchy that starchiness will get
[50:27] out of you
[50:28] unless you're just your mind's so seared
[50:30] and so and so
[50:32] that then then god can't do nothing with
[50:35] you
[50:36] so see we need martha's in our life we
[50:39] need mechanics
[50:40] but we also need mary's in our life we
[50:43] need dynamics too
[50:44] god brother branham did not say get rid
[50:47] of the mechanics
[50:48] let's only take dynamics amen no he said
[50:51] let's take dynamics and let's take
[50:52] mechanics both make this thing move
[50:55] amen saints amen amen
[50:58] this one thing amen have i desired amen
[51:00] in my life amen
[51:02] the one thing that matters most amen
[51:05] are are you lacking that in your life
[51:08] amen
[51:08] what is that one thing that is hindering
[51:10] you right amen
[51:12] seek and you shall find look in your
[51:15] life

[51:42] literally doing that
[51:43] bella was in it zoe went through the
[51:45] prayer line and she was like what's
[51:47] going on
[51:49] what's going on when she saw me there at
[51:50] the prayer line then she kind of relaxed
[51:52] a little bit you know
[51:53] she didn't know what to do she didn't
[51:55] understand
[51:57] but man it does something to you saying
[51:59] say man to hear or just see young people
[52:01] lay men excited about god
[52:03] like i said earlier i'd rather see him
[52:04] do that than at a pop concert
[52:09] and if that you know i can't help it
[52:12] that you're not like that that's
[52:14] between you and god that's fine i don't
[52:16] know what you're going to do in heaven
[52:18] there's going to be excitement in heaven
[52:20] david david talked about joy
[52:22] you know and even hell there's going to
[52:25] be excitement in hell
[52:26] there's going to be gnashing and win of
[52:29] teeth and things like that people i mean
[52:30] people ain't gonna stay still
[52:32] right i mean people are gonna you know
[52:34] there's gonna be
[52:38] we're avoiding dancing on the coals amen
[52:42] wherever you go there's gonna be
[52:44] excitement
[52:46] but you know a a young a young person
[52:49] let's just take it like this for example
[52:50] a little kid when he's born in life amen
[52:53] he's not still a little baby amen a
[52:57] little a toddler man he's not still he's
[52:59] he's moving and touching and he wants he
[53:01] wants to run on me
[53:02] sister anna a man dealing with little
[53:04] david i mean he just
[53:07] you know just i don't see how they can
[53:09] do it amen
[53:10] i pray for you brother anderson and
[53:12] sister
[53:14] but i'm sure little i'm sure little
[53:16] sarah's helping you guys
[53:19] but they're they're they're they can't
[53:21] stay still that's part of a little kid
[53:23] that's part of a
[53:24] a person that is born again that just
[53:26] come in amen he's excited about god
[53:29] a little young person excited about why
[53:31] would you go down there and try to
[53:32] quench that
[53:34] why would we old that we are older now
[53:37] and and and all we do is maybe worry
[53:40] about
[53:41] you know and argue about the color of
[53:42] the paint and the wall and the color of
[53:44] the paint and the carpet and
[53:45] and all that kind of stuff hey man you
[53:47] you've gone through that already
[53:49] don't quench those that they're going
[53:51] through that in their life
[53:52] let them go through that in their life
[53:54] they need that
[53:56] they need that in their life so that
[53:58] they can
[53:59] at some point grow sit down and listen
[54:02] to the word then
[54:02] gloria then teaching can help them but
[54:05] they have gotten that foundation amen
[54:07] right
[54:07] you see a little kid does not stay
[54:11] you know enacted i mean moving around
[54:14] forever eventually they get to be
[54:16] teenagers
[54:17] eventually they'll get to be adults
[54:21] amen let's be careful to not do that to
[54:24] our young people
[54:25] i beg you amen in the name of the lord
[54:28] amen and that's that that's that's
[54:31] that's the thing that i say that i say i
[54:33] use that example amen
[54:35] so a young person gets excited i get
[54:38] excited even as adults and man we get
[54:39] excited about god
[54:40] amen just step right in it amen
[54:44] start practicing because that's what's
[54:45] going to happen in heaven
[54:49] i don't see us amen just in there amen
[54:54] praise god there's jesus christ
[54:58] the one i've always wanted to see
[55:03] i don't see that saint i don't see that
[55:06] amen so if you don't want to do it then
[55:10] don't get in the way of those that do
[55:11] want to do it
[55:13] don't don't get in the way of those that
[55:14] you want they want to amen
[55:16] praise god brother branham says here
[55:19] amen brothers could put these
[55:21] these quotes hey man we'll end with this
[55:23] now we're too busy talking about other
[55:25] things
[55:26] i think that that's the reason many
[55:27] people who love him watch what he says
[55:29] here
[55:30] that's the reason why many people who
[55:32] love him
[55:34] fail to see him
[55:37] martha loved jesus but she failed
[55:41] to get that part that mary got because
[55:44] she was so encumbered about the
[55:46] the the time and everything it has to be
[55:48] done
[55:49] she failed the good part she felt to get
[55:52] that
[55:53] who love him fail to see him we're so
[55:56] busy with our
[55:57] creeds and denominations and business
[55:59] about the churches
[56:00] and memberships and getting more members
[56:02] and things we're too busy to talk about
[56:03] him
[56:04] you know he's talking to the
[56:04] pentecostals let's just bring it down
[56:06] home
[56:07] you know we're too busy about everything
[56:09] else you know that that we do amen if it
[56:11] gets in the way of god
[56:12] amen something's wrong if it's helped to
[56:15] advance the kingdom of god
[56:17] then praise god amen
[56:21] we're too busy to talk about him he's
[56:23] the word
[56:24] we're too interested in what the some
[56:25] creed some textbook or something else
[56:27] says
[56:28] how many members can we get in vote them
[56:30] in shall we take this one that one the
[56:32] other one
[56:32] we should be constantly giving ourselves
[56:34] to the word of god
[56:36] in prayer studying the word
[56:39] but we're into we're too interested in
[56:41] something else
[56:44] i didn't say that the prophet that you
[56:46] believe that god sent said that
[56:49] and that was 1964 after the seals
[56:54] watch what he says in 1961 he says but
[56:56] day in that day was too busy
[56:59] took up with other things and casting
[57:01] their nets and going back to the fishing
[57:03] talking about the disciples and we are
[57:05] today the same thing
[57:07] this took up with so many different this
[57:09] that and the other and so many isms and
[57:11] so many denominations
[57:12] and so many organizations and the chief
[57:15] presbyter and we got to really watch
[57:16] what kind of a meeting we cooperate with
[57:18] because the district superintendent will
[57:20] turn us out
[57:21] and then if we go down to such in such a
[57:23] meeting the pastor will turn us out and
[57:25] if the oh the bishop will do something
[57:27] to us or the church will excommunicate
[57:29] us
[57:29] oh and we're so busy watching our
[57:31] members to see that they don't go to no
[57:32] other church or have anything else to do
[57:35] but just our little clique
[57:39] i didn't say that he said it we're so
[57:41] busy with that
[57:43] it's just like swapping members one with
[57:44] another and it's just like taking

[1:14:03] all right thank the lord jesus i was
[1:14:05] downstairs so um i was listening thank
[1:14:07] you for that message brother
[1:14:09] um i got a real live testimony of miriam
[1:14:11] martha actually and um i was the martha
[1:14:13] in this case
[1:14:14] um i just moved down from baltimore
[1:14:17] about 10 months ago
[1:14:18] last year memorial day is when i got
[1:14:20] down here
[1:14:21] and so um me and my son move with my dad
[1:14:24] for a minute and we're still there
[1:14:26] so um and naturally i'm used to
[1:14:29] being busy that's how my mom was so i'm
[1:14:31] used to being busy household stuff just
[1:14:33] busy
[1:14:34] cooking cleaning you know the woman kind
[1:14:35] of stuff and um
[1:14:37] so my dad is more of the laid-back type
[1:14:39] like
[1:14:40] mets don't bother him it doesn't bother
[1:14:42] him of stuff everywhere he just that's
[1:14:44] how he is
[1:14:44] he a man you know
[1:14:46] [Laughter]
[1:14:48] so being there for 10 months i'm not
[1:14:50] really um we didn't grow up close so
[1:14:53] when him and my mother were together
[1:14:55] they were my mother did most everything
[1:14:57] in the house so
[1:14:58] i didn't really know my dad to do
[1:14:59] anything so i was used to things the way
[1:15:01] it was
[1:15:02] my mom kept everything clean cooked
[1:15:03] everything so um
[1:15:06] me being with my dad now i was actually
[1:15:08] just now getting to see
[1:15:10] him in the light without they're not
[1:15:11] together anymore so now i'm getting to
[1:15:13] see my dad the way he is
[1:15:14] without my mom around anymore so it was
[1:15:16] completely different
[1:15:18] and uh so it was a battle for me though
[1:15:22] it was a real battle for me to uh
[1:15:26] be there and
[1:15:29] him not really helping so i was doing
[1:15:31] everything i was busy
[1:15:33] breakfast lunch dinner of course you got
[1:15:34] to do that because you got a child but
[1:15:36] you know
[1:15:36] doing it for him too it started to
[1:15:38] bother me like dad you need to do the
[1:15:39] dishes or something you know clean up
[1:15:40] after yourself dude
[1:15:41] you know it was getting to me was
[1:15:43] getting to me so after 10 months i mean
[1:15:45] i was talking to the lord about it i was
[1:15:46] like god you know
[1:15:47] i don't want you know i'm not too used
[1:15:49] to them we didn't grow up with a
[1:15:51] our communication being too strong so
[1:15:53] i'm not the type to sit down dad let me
[1:15:54] tell you exactly what you need to do
[1:15:56] okay
[1:15:56] so it's more like i'll take it take it
[1:15:58] take it or you know your eat back here
[1:16:00] take this in the kitchen i'm like dad i
[1:16:01] just did everything can you just
[1:16:03] you know maybe get up put you on you
[1:16:04] know that's how i felt inside just to be
[1:16:06] honest
[1:16:07] so i was praying praying because i don't
[1:16:08] want it on me i don't want that my
[1:16:10] spirit to be bothered and disturbed so
[1:16:12] after 10 months it just kind of take a
[1:16:13] toll on you so this is what um the lord
[1:16:16] gave me an answer one day and um my dad
[1:16:19] he definitely listened to his messages
[1:16:21] he plays brother branham every day he
[1:16:23] relax he chills
[1:16:24] he's older now so he's more relaxed he
[1:16:27] plays his messages
[1:16:28] all the time praise the lord but this is
[1:16:31] what god showed me after a while after
[1:16:32] all the praying everything he showed me
[1:16:34] that i was martha and my dad is doing
[1:16:37] the necessary one necessary thing
[1:16:39] and when that came to me i was like wow
[1:16:42] i'm the one that needs to chill
[1:16:43] god showed me myself instead of my dad
[1:16:45] he showed me what my dad was doing was
[1:16:46] necessary and i was like wow i got to
[1:16:48] take a chill
[1:16:49] so two day you know i started to relax
[1:16:51] stop doing the dishes all the time
[1:16:52] everything don't need to be done and i
[1:16:54] started spending more time with the lord
[1:16:55] instead like
[1:16:56] you know so that's funny how you brought
[1:16:57] that up
[1:17:00] lord so thank the lord for that um but
[1:17:02] this is a testimony that happened um
[1:17:04] sunday when i was here and um isaac was
[1:17:08] with me
[1:17:08] and he ended up having a game he played
[1:17:10] sports he's very good at it that's
[1:17:12] that's one of his gifts he's very
[1:17:14] athletic
[1:17:15] um but anyway they end up having a game
[1:17:17] that sunday
[1:17:18] and um he was asking me if he if we can
[1:17:20] leave church to go and i was like well i
[1:17:22] don't know about that depends on what
[1:17:23] time we get out
[1:17:25] so um he was bugging me about it all
[1:17:28] throughout the whole service and i was
[1:17:30] just like isaac
[1:17:31] we're putting god first we're not i'm
[1:17:32] not leaving here to go to no game or
[1:17:34] anything like that it's just gonna have
[1:17:35] to you know if we don't
[1:17:36] get out in time it's just not gonna work
[1:17:38] so um
[1:17:41] during the break um before second
[1:17:43] service
[1:17:44] um he was still nagging me about it you
[1:17:46] know mom can we make it can we go can we
[1:17:47] go
[1:17:48] like i said no we're not going we're not
[1:17:49] going i said um you're just gonna look
[1:17:51] we got to put god first
[1:17:53] sports gonna have to wait and i mean he
[1:17:55] was just really getting a nerve about it
[1:17:56] so um
[1:17:58] i told him the um testimony about
[1:18:01] brother branham and how god ended up
[1:18:03] holding the plane for him
[1:18:04] that time when he went to go meet up
[1:18:06] with that lady i know some of y'all know
[1:18:07] the story already
[1:18:08] but how god held that plane for him and
[1:18:10] i was trying to encourage isaac to say
[1:18:12] you never know what god can do if you
[1:18:13] put him first you never know what
[1:18:15] he can do if you put him first amen so
[1:18:17] isaac was still discouraged he's not
[1:18:18] going to do that for me you know i said
[1:18:20] well you never know he can do it or he
[1:18:21] cannot do it
[1:18:22] but he can do it if you put him first
[1:18:23] you'll be surprised
[1:18:25] so um he was still kind of discouraged
[1:18:28] being this maid and just uh me and t.c
[1:18:30] and the family went to the park on the
[1:18:32] break of the church during that break
[1:18:34] period we just went out they had a good
[1:18:35] time fellowship ate and everything
[1:18:37] isaac kind of sat around the van and uh
[1:18:39] didn't want to come out or anything but
[1:18:41] finally he came out and ate and kind of
[1:18:42] still
[1:18:43] still bugging me about it so uh
[1:18:46] when we came back to service and
[1:18:47] everything um the game
[1:18:49] started at 4 20 but we were still in
[1:18:52] service so my mind was already dismissed
[1:18:54] from it like i know that's not gonna
[1:18:55] work so i'm not gonna worry about it
[1:18:57] um but he was still bugging me about it
[1:18:59] he was looking at his watching church
[1:19:00] falling asleep i'm up here
[1:19:02] you know it was i was gonna know it but
[1:19:04] um
[1:19:05] when we left service um i was like well
[1:19:07] i think you never know you might still
[1:19:08] make it so we it take an hour for us to
[1:19:10] get home but i was like you never know
[1:19:12] we might can still make it you never
[1:19:13] know no we ain't gonna make it it's over
[1:19:15] i don't care no more so i'm like okay
[1:19:16] well i'm not gonna worry about it so
[1:19:18] we get we get back and i just kind of
[1:19:19] laid back in my van for a minute he got
[1:19:21] out
[1:19:23] next thing i know isaac come out the
[1:19:26] house with his face all lit up mom the
[1:19:27] game don't start at 6 30 ah
[1:19:28] having another game i just had to
[1:19:31] rejoice god in that moment because i
[1:19:32] knew i meant
[1:19:33] it was god all the way trying to show
[1:19:34] isaac something that if we put him first
[1:19:37] he can he can work out anything
[1:19:38] right and even something that god knew
[1:19:40] he cared about that but god i believe
[1:19:41] god was really trying to show him isaac
[1:19:43] he put me first and that goes for all of
[1:19:44] us
[1:19:45] and myself put him first he can work
[1:19:47] everything else out
[1:19:48] everything else out and um another
[1:19:50] message is in that
[1:19:51] period of us waiting on anything and we
[1:19:54] just can enjoy our life in the midst of
[1:19:56] all that because
[1:19:56] isaac could have enjoyed his whole day
[1:19:58] if he knew god was going to work that
[1:19:59] out at the end but that's how i do
[1:20:01] sometimes i'll be all worried up and
[1:20:02] worked up
[1:20:03] and then when things worked out i looked
[1:20:04] back like man i could enjoy my the rest
