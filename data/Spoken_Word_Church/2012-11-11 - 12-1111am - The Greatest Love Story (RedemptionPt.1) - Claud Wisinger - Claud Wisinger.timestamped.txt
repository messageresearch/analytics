[6:54] the word out there glory and it will not
[6:56] return void I believe that's right on my
[6:58] heart so I know that brother uh I hate
[7:02] to keep you staying I'm Gonna Keep you
[7:03] standing for me I'm not Joel Forney I'm
[7:05] not a helicopter preacher I don't go
[7:07] straight up and come straight down I'm
[7:09] like the C30 transport I'm a big fella
[7:11] it takes me a while to get to the end of
[7:13] the runway once I get up in the air it's
[7:15] going to be fast and furious and then
[7:16] we're going to come back down okay I'm
[7:18] gonna be honest with you I'm a little
[7:19] different brother Jewel I'm a little
[7:21] different brother Samuel but we all
[7:23] preach the same message that's right we
[7:26] do have Unity of the faith right right
[7:28] and that word faith means Revelation you
[7:30] understand we do preach the same message
[7:32] we're under the same messenger and it's
[7:35] the same holy spirit that reveals us to
[7:36] assistance now he talks in his what are
[7:40] you call you guys at Georgia Bulldog
[7:42] games yeah his brother Branham I tell
[7:44] people talk at our church Kentucky ease
[7:46] and I talk in okibonics okay high top
[7:50] and okibani so you're gonna hear a thing
[7:53] you may laugh at some of the the cliches
[7:55] I use because I'm an Oklahoman I've been
[7:58] there my whole my life and and is what I
[8:00] am I'm An American in this last election
[8:03] it breaks your heart when you see it
[8:04] happens that this part of me is sad but
[8:07] there's something on the inside of me
[8:08] that knows I'm a stranger and a
[8:11] pilgrimage and I'm just passing through
[8:13] this later so I know that God sets up
[8:16] and God tears down and once you have
[8:19] total confidence in him
[8:21] you know that confidence is love you
[8:24] know when you love your wife you have
[8:26] confidence in them is that right and if
[8:28] you really love Jesus Christ you're
[8:30] going to have confidence in him right
[8:31] that he's going to do what he said he
[8:33] would do and brother Graham said he's
[8:35] looking for a bride that'll take him in
[8:37] his word right and what is that it's
[8:39] your death confidence he will perform
[8:41] what he said he would do and that's the
[8:44] Bride of Jesus Christ I enjoy preaching
[8:46] here you're a lovely group of people
[8:48] you're well taught I can tell that when
[8:50] I Minister it when a minister preaches
[8:52] they see faces you know brother Brandon
[8:55] one thing he said I wish you could see
[8:56] the devil's face now you know what he
[8:59] was looking at the people when he
[9:01] preached serpent seed there'd be some
[9:02] out there going
[9:04] if you want
[9:05] you know who's getting it as a preacher
[9:08] and you say it's a spiritual discernment
[9:09] not all together because your body will
[9:12] respond to a revelation right I don't
[9:14] know about you but there I've spent a
[9:15] lot of Tears in the Book of Genesis
[9:17] right I told Brother Jess when he
[9:19] pastored our church I said you preached
[9:21] so much out of Genesis the pages stick
[9:23] together I've cried so much in there and
[9:25] so you will respond to the message of
[9:28] our is that right this outside is going
[9:30] to show what's on the inside right so
[9:33] just you know it's got to it's just the
[9:35] way it works right so anyway I'm gonna
[9:37] I'm gonna read a scripture and I'll let
[9:39] you be seen because it's gonna take me a
[9:41] while to warm up and then it's gonna
[9:42] you're gonna see me I'm like a rocket
[9:44] blast we're gonna go okay so let's go to
[9:47] Leviticus 25 if you would please
[9:49] I thought this when I first read this
[9:51] and and I'll explain it a minute I'm
[9:53] gonna read the scripture I'm gonna let
[9:54] you sit down I got a lot I'm gonna lay
[9:55] some work and then we'll uh we'll go
[9:58] from there okay of a minute since
[10:00] Leviticus 25 and 23. listen what it says
[10:03] real close the land shall not be sold
[10:06] forever right okay for the land is mine
[10:11] who's the Lord do you know the promised
[10:14] land wasn't even Israel's it was God's
[10:16] land right but he said he told him he
[10:18] said okay Israel you cannot sell the
[10:21] land forever right in other words
[10:23] brother you can't sell it you cannot
[10:25] sell it is that what it's saying now
[10:26] let's know what it's saying for ye are
[10:29] strangers and Soldiers with me you know
[10:31] what I just said right the land was what
[10:34] did I say oh that's my note I hope you
[10:36] ain't got my note up there I don't know
[10:37] where I'm going okay but anyway I'm
[10:40] gonna I'm gonna try at the end of this
[10:41] read the entire book of rude that's why
[10:43] it's gonna take me a long time this
[10:45] afternoon I know you think that's crazy
[10:46] but that's my note so I didn't know we
[10:49] had that on there I should have told him
[10:50] to take it out and in all the land of
[10:52] your possession this is this next verse
[10:55] ye shall Grant a Redemption for the land
[10:57] right do you realize the previous
[10:58] scripture he said the land is mine
[11:00] forever right right and you can't sell
[11:02] it the next verse he says now I'm going
[11:04] to give you Redemption for land now if I
[11:07] wasn't a spiritual man and had
[11:08] Revelation I would say God contradicted
[11:10] himself no God knew that they were going
[11:13] to go in debt God knew they were going
[11:15] to have to sell their land to get out of
[11:17] debt you understand and this is really
[11:20] these two verses here is showing you the
[11:22] Plan of Redemption amen that God said
[11:24] don't sell it forever right but God knew
[11:27] you would fall God knew you would be a
[11:29] sinner is that right so he made a way of
[11:33] redemption a plan a Redemption even
[11:36] though his commandment was don't sell
[11:38] the land it's mine is that right but
[11:41] they did it anyway do you realize God
[11:44] wrote your name on a book before the
[11:46] foundation of the world that he already
[11:48] set the Plan of Redemption right right
[11:49] there yes you're name was on the book
[11:52] you're already a part of the plan right
[11:54] now man God put your name there but
[11:56] God knew you would fall God knew Eve
[11:58] would fall this is the same thing he's
[12:01] saying here see God don't change his
[12:02] mind about Redemption he says don't sin
[12:05] the day you said Eve that day you'll die
[12:08] but he knew they would do it right he
[12:11] had already had a Plan of Redemption set
[12:13] for him where they could come back now
[12:15] that's Grace brother that's love I think
[12:19] don't you yeah let's bow our heads dear
[12:21] heavenly father we thank you for the
[12:22] reading of the word we pray that you'll
[12:24] give a revelation your Prophet said well
[12:26] we need more than our next meal
[12:29] is a revelation from God lord Jesus we
[12:32] ask for that Revelation here this
[12:34] morning therefore your Prophet said the
[12:36] Rapture was a revelation give us that
[12:38] Revelation today in Jesus Christ's name
[12:40] we ask it amen you may be seated
[12:44] let's put up the one on the definition
[12:46] of revelation if you want to Brother
[12:47] Joseph please
[12:52] I don't know if you look you know it
[12:53] says the revelation of Jesus Christ is
[12:55] given to John you know in the first
[12:57] chapter of Revelation that's right if
[12:59] you go in a message and you click on the
[13:01] word revelation these are the different
[13:03] definitions it gives this is the one
[13:05] that really struck me yeah everybody see
[13:07] this one here that I highlighted it's
[13:09] coming so let's do this let's call it
[13:12] the coming of Jesus Christ do you have a
[13:14] problem with me doing that because
[13:16] that's what it when he that angel has
[13:18] said it in 10 7. what was he bringing a
[13:21] revelation what did Brother random say
[13:23] this save and seal was the coming of the
[13:25] Lord is that right brother Brandon said
[13:28] and I had him show it here and you've
[13:30] been preaching the Book of Revelation I
[13:32] have two I just haven't been doing it
[13:34] the way you have part one but it is you
[13:36] know what I mean so you guys are going
[13:39] to hear exactly what he's been preaching
[13:40] to you yeah you just want to hear milky
[13:42] box
[13:47] the bride has got to come to the unity
[13:49] face speaking the same thing you you are
[13:52] the final voice to the final age under
[13:54] your master right he's got to preach
[13:57] what brother Brandon's saying you've got
[13:59] to preach what Brethren and that's the
[14:00] unity of Faith all right because
[14:02] remember brother Brown said there's in
[14:04] the Redemption he said there's seven
[14:05] plans of redemption is that what he said
[14:07] if you're in Paul's age you were under
[14:09] that Plan of Redemption if you're an
[14:12] ireneous age you would have fell over
[14:13] Irene if you took the message of Irene
[14:16] it's that you were part of the Plan of
[14:18] Redemption for that hour right sure reth
[14:20] said you were predestinated for this
[14:22] hour you're the one that would receive
[14:25] this message you're the one that would
[14:27] eat the whole book right that's what
[14:29] annoys me today we got message churches
[14:31] that are naughty eating the whole book
[14:33] right you know what they want to do they
[14:35] want to tear out the Book of Revelations
[14:36] yeah
[14:38] focusing now I'm gonna tell you
[14:40] something you're gonna think I'm funny
[14:41] I'm gonna say it in a minute and you you
[14:43] really you're well taught you'll get
[14:44] what I'm saying brother Brandon said the
[14:46] Book of Revelations is in three parts
[14:48] right he said chapter one through three
[14:50] is the church ages right now let me ask
[14:52] you something did he come to Paul did he
[14:55] come to ireneus yeah man did he come to
[14:57] William Bradham you're a prophet so see
[15:00] it says the coming of Jesus Christ man
[15:03] you say the revelation of Jesus Christ
[15:05] now I'm going to tell you what the
[15:06] definition I'm gonna break it brother
[15:07] said we're supposed to say to cool of a
[15:09] room break it down for the people right
[15:10] right so now we're going to break it
[15:12] down it's the whole book of Revelation
[15:14] is the coming of Jesus Christ
[15:17] these things must shortly come to yes is
[15:19] that what he's saying it sure did 53 A.D
[15:22] it shortly come to pass he came to Paul
[15:25] Paul went to Hebrew the book of Hebrews
[15:27] guys I don't know if you know it or not
[15:28] the book of Hebrews the theologians say
[15:31] Paul didn't write it they argue that
[15:33] Paul wrote it you know why the book of
[15:35] Hebrews is his notes where he went into
[15:37] the synagogues and preached yeah first
[15:39] when he went into the city he would go
[15:41] into the synagogue he would give it to
[15:43] the Jews they would reject it he'd go
[15:45] outside and he'd preach it to the
[15:46] Gentiles in that town finally Paul said
[15:49] you know what I'm tired of this the Jew
[15:51] of every city I went to in Asia Minor
[15:54] they rejected I went into every
[15:55] synagogue I go there first because he
[15:58] said take it to the juice first right
[15:59] and they reject it so it goes right to
[16:02] the Gentiles amen see brother Brown said
[16:04] we Gentiles are going to hand this
[16:05] message back to the gym right does
[16:07] everybody understand in June of this
[16:09] year they opened the first message
[16:11] Church in Jerusalem in June of this year
[16:14] the first message church has been opened
[16:17] in Jerusalem
[16:19] I it just makes a hair stain on my back
[16:21] when I talk about that it's showing you
[16:23] that this gospel is soon to replace go
[16:26] to the Jews everybody believe that now
[16:28] I'm going to scatter this and I'm going
[16:29] to tell you why I'm going to pre
[16:31] preaching you I'm going to tell you my
[16:32] title now the greatest love story right
[16:34] Redemption amen but brother Branham win
[16:37] the book it was the whole book all right
[16:38] he said in chapter 5 of Revelation the
[16:41] seals were sealed on the Seven Seals on
[16:43] the back side and within the book right
[16:45] see what people don't understand did we
[16:48] understand serpency no brother random
[16:49] time was that sealed so see the book was
[16:52] sealed within the book
[16:54] and on the back side of the book
[16:56] Revelations does everybody got what I'm
[16:57] saying so did we understand uh knowing
[17:01] Turtle hell
[17:02] no we didn't understand those things
[17:04] right did we really totally understand
[17:06] Redemption right right exactly right we
[17:08] didn't so see the whole book
[17:11] and it's the book of redemption is that
[17:14] what it was is that what was open in
[17:15] chapter five right the most Sublime
[17:17] scripture all right so everybody look
[17:20] the word survive he's Grandeur right can
[17:22] I put in okibonics the bestest right the
[17:25] bestest scripture there is is Revelation
[17:28] chapter five and you know what he saved
[17:31] the bestest for last this is it folks he
[17:34] predestinated you for this hour right
[17:36] because you're the ones that's going to
[17:38] digest you're gonna eat the whole book
[17:41] you're not going to chair out Daniel's
[17:44] book right
[17:47] let me say it let me break it down
[17:49] you're not going to tear out Daniel's 70
[17:51] weeks right right because you have to
[17:53] eat the whole book you have to eat
[17:55] serpency yeah you have to eat Redemption
[17:58] you have to eat the Book of Ruth right
[18:00] you have to eat all those books buddy
[18:02] right because look low I come in the
[18:05] volume of the book it's written to me
[18:07] amen who is me the kinsman redeemer Not
[18:10] Me Jesus Christ is that right he was the
[18:13] kinsman redeemer and it's required of
[18:15] you all right can I say it again right
[18:17] it is required of you to eat the whole
[18:20] world God just didn't open the whole
[18:22] book just because God don't do something
[18:26] just because God's got a purpose and the
[18:29] purpose of the whole book is redemption
[18:32] and I'll tell you what since I've been
[18:34] preaching on it just set me on Fire
[18:36] Inside Man because it helps me realize
[18:38] who I am God has become more real to me
[18:42] in this hour since I've been ministering
[18:44] this then he's ever been right all right
[18:46] it's the truth he's become more you know
[18:48] more real means true right it does you
[18:51] know she's a real wife to me she's true
[18:53] right right this is what it says that's
[18:54] what real means my God is real for I
[18:57] can't feel right give me my soul and
[19:00] he's true to me I understand all right
[19:02] and I'm true to him right right what the
[19:05] reason I'm true to him is appreciation
[19:06] of what he did right right that's your
[19:08] sanctification if you don't do this
[19:11] message you don't believe it right
[19:12] justification is what he did for you
[19:15] right those he justified right he
[19:18] glorified amen but sanctification is
[19:20] what you do in appreciation for what
[19:22] he's done for you and sanctification is
[19:24] serving him right and if you're not
[19:26] doing this message the do's and don'ts
[19:28] of this message you're not serving him
[19:30] right it's going to show you where
[19:32] you're at in the progression of
[19:34] redemption right can I say it that way
[19:36] no I don't like the word progression in
[19:38] the steps remember him said there's
[19:40] three steps and he said you know brother
[19:41] man said that was his message
[19:43] the woman stand going down the road on
[19:45] high heels like this oh don't listen to
[19:48] that crazy man that Prophet don't listen
[19:51] to him she he said he heard the most
[19:52] blood hurtling straight scream when she
[19:55] fell off that road right and he said
[19:57] there was three steps remember it was
[19:58] his his mother the Indian it she was in
[20:01] the end and she had she had always a
[20:02] spiritual dream right he said that is my
[20:05] message three steps justification amen
[20:07] sanctification of baptism all together
[20:09] you want most of the preachers in this
[20:10] message preach yeah and brothers said it
[20:13] but you better put some detail or wrap
[20:15] it around it right because people
[20:17] he said this if you recognizing your day
[20:20] just leave the message you believe the
[20:22] message you got the Holy Ghost yeah the
[20:24] scripture says that you can know all the
[20:26] Mysteries
[20:27] come on you can know all the mysteries
[20:30] of this mess message and you don't have
[20:32] love you're a team lead singer you're
[20:35] just a noise makers all you want well we
[20:38] got around the message there's a bunch
[20:39] of noise makers they don't even most
[20:42] people in the message don't even
[20:43] understand true justification
[20:45] sanctification and the baptism Holy
[20:48] Ghost what we got is a bunch of dry eye
[20:51] church members right you can be a member
[20:54] of this Tabernacle this morning and you
[20:57] ain't it's not good enough right I'm
[21:00] sorry you can come to this Tabernacle
[21:02] every time the doors are open right it's
[21:05] not good enough amen that's your
[21:07] reasonable service that you serving him
[21:10] right we got people even in my church it
[21:12] says you're supposed to go to church as
[21:14] you see even more as you see the day
[21:17] appearing right is that what the
[21:18] scripture says and some of you hitting
[21:21] me it's hit and miss that's the way you
[21:23] serve God right that's sanctification is
[21:26] how you serve him right right it's what
[21:28] you do in appreciation for what he's
[21:30] done for you you can't three times out
[21:32] of your week to come here and gather
[21:34] together and you know what you've come
[21:35] to do you know what worship is to adore
[21:37] him all right but you think worship is

[21:51] it the bride that made herself ready
[21:53] you're waiting this is what people in
[21:56] the message mean
[21:57] they say that it is it's a quote they
[22:01] say the Revelation is a a Rapture so
[22:04] everybody some of you right here this
[22:06] morning I don't doubt are sitting here
[22:08] waiting for a single Revelation that all
[22:11] of a sudden you're going to get raptured
[22:12] out of here is that what you believe I'm
[22:15] going to tell you I know for a fact some
[22:17] of you believe it I've watched it too
[22:19] much do you know you go read the Rapture
[22:21] book and brother Brown don't talk about
[22:23] a revelation he talks about the whole
[22:26] book right he talks about Revelations
[22:28] you have to eat serpent seed you have to
[22:31] eat the Redemption story you have to be
[22:33] baptized you have to see one and said on
[22:35] the front you need to see the 20 and
[22:38] four Elders there's a lot that you need
[22:40] to digest to this book because you know
[22:43] what whatever you eat is what you become
[22:55] said the word of God's anointed already
[22:57] right if you don't eat the whole book
[23:00] you don't have the whole anointing of
[23:02] the word you're not going to be in that
[23:04] new Temple does everybody understand so
[23:07] people say oh I believe the message
[23:09] shoppie left outfits you're a stench in
[23:12] God's nostrils is what you are you're
[23:15] supposed to bring a sacrifice and you're
[23:16] a Living Sacrifice before God you may
[23:19] have you're a cross-eyed
[23:22] bow-legged Christian it won't walk this
[23:24] right and you expect to present that to
[23:26] God you better bring the best of the
[23:29] best before you God because it's the
[23:31] appreciation of what he's done for you
[23:33] right so I'm going to tell you some of
[23:35] you are Sanctified you made a decision
[23:37] to come out of the world and the things
[23:38] of the world but you're not Sanctified
[23:40] you're not serving it every day what do
[23:43] you say what do I have to do to make it
[23:44] an everyday simple Christian life
[23:47] amen like that old boy in England
[23:50] remember you was delivering the
[23:51] Christmas presents he'd have a little
[23:54] shot of whiskey in one house and another
[23:55] and another another he's walking through
[23:58] the snow
[23:59] and he looks back at his son he says
[24:01] where are you at he's back here trying
[24:03] to follow in his footsteps and that man
[24:05] quit drinking after that right did you
[24:07] know brother man said you each and every
[24:09] one of you in this Billy leave
[24:10] footprints on the sand of time but some
[24:12] of you want your children is growing up
[24:14] to fall in your footsteps when you say
[24:17] you're a message brother you'll cheat a
[24:18] brother out in the world see what people
[24:20] think in this message if I cheat a
[24:22] Baptist or a Methodist out there it's
[24:24] okay no they got the same father you did
[24:26] right now you need to get a revelation
[24:28] from God you're supposed to walk up
[24:31] right you shrunk events
[24:33] what you do is you bring a reproach on
[24:36] this Bible that I believe
[24:38] get yourself Sanctified brother
[25:03] you better start looking at
[25:04] sanctification and look at it real close
[25:06] all right right because you think oh I
[25:08] believe the message so what the devil
[25:10] believes in dreams that's right right
[25:13] I'm not mad but it surely got me on fire
[25:16] right now Big Brother
[25:18] so Book of Revelation chapter one
[25:20] through three they only know what that's
[25:22] coming Church age
[25:24] he said chapter four through nine right
[25:26] because look there's two quotes remember
[25:28] I asked you one I just want to be sure I
[25:29] had it right yeah
[25:31] four to 19. did I say that oh well read
[25:36] between lines
[25:37] Revelation 4 to 19. you understand by
[25:40] the way it was too close he says we go
[25:42] up before we come down to 19. right he
[25:44] says Revelation 4 19 are the Jews
[25:46] I'm gonna sneak something in here for
[25:48] you okay
[25:50] you know what I did so when I looked at
[25:52] this whenever I have said this I've been
[25:54] preaching now
[25:55] since the first year on those three
[25:57] parts I said he said there's three parts
[26:00] right now I'm going to dissect it down
[26:02] for the people the three parts okay I
[26:05] preached three months on this first one
[26:07] yeah I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna give
[26:09] you a quick review okay look if you want
[26:11] to understand how you fall
[26:13] remember the work of the churches or in
[26:15] both ages right
[26:16] and all those Spirits in each age comes
[26:19] down to this age right the first Spirit
[26:21] of the first stage was Antichrist right
[26:23] you know and there was somebody in our
[26:25] church said this okay let me show you
[26:26] how simple it is can I show you
[26:29] in our church said well when my girls
[26:31] get to be 16 they're going to make they
[26:33] can wear pants they wear earbuds they
[26:35] can cut their hair because remember
[26:37] they're 16. and she told it in the
[26:39] church somebody got back to me now this
[26:42] I'm gonna say this is hard this sister
[26:43] may watch it but I'll preach in our
[26:45] church big deal
[26:46] you know you're going to take it it may
[26:48] sometimes it's not it's bitter isn't
[26:52] that right it's better
[26:54] but I told her I said look I got another
[26:57] Pulpit because they're going around see
[26:58] that spirit's going around right as a
[27:00] pastor if a spirit comes into this
[27:01] church he's obligated to kill it right
[27:03] and if he don't you need to vote him out
[27:06] and if I see a spirit creeping into this
[27:09] church and I don't Hammer that thing
[27:10] yeah I told my church would you do me a
[27:13] favor and vote me out right yeah before
[27:15] I harm Myself by keeping my mouth shut
[27:16] and letting things go that's not the way
[27:19] to solve things Phineas in the scripture
[27:22] remember him
[27:23] he took a a spear and thrust that
[27:25] through and for four generations after
[27:27] his family was blessed why because the
[27:30] rest of the Levi stood there doing
[27:31] nothing you know what we got in the
[27:33] message there's Levi's standing there
[27:35] doing nothing get your Spear and kill
[27:38] the thing they were in the church in a
[27:41] tent door crying and he took a strange
[27:44] woman into his tent right in front of
[27:45] him that's you know what can I tell you
[27:48] something people will bring people will
[27:51] come in this message and I I've seen it
[27:53] I don't know this is awful
[27:55] because you may have humble say it okay
[27:57] I've had people come to my church a man
[27:59] and woman be married okay then she's
[28:02] going through the change he can't take
[28:04] any divorces or he brings another one
[28:05] from a Baptist Church in there yeah yeah
[28:07] you know what I told him
[28:09] I said what in the world are you doing
[28:11] right I call him pizza out in the corner
[28:14] I said what are you doing man well you
[28:16] know the scripture says it's better to
[28:18] marry to burn I said you misplaced the
[28:19] scripture that's right and say if you
[28:21] have a virgin daughter right that she's
[28:23] engaged and she can't keep herself to an
[28:24] engagement get her married don't let him
[28:27] live dirty dirty till they have the vow
[28:29] does everybody understand that right
[28:31] that's right he ain't talking about you
[28:32] not heads and got a wife and you're
[28:34] looking another wife
[28:35] you need to get Sanctified man amen he
[28:39] tried to blow that button I thought are
[28:41] you kidding me right and you know what
[28:43] this is what I told him I said look I'm
[28:45] going to be honest with you there's a
[28:46] lot of preachers in the message out
[28:48] there that will accept you in the shape
[28:50] you're currently in they'll even let you
[28:52] marry that woman but I said I'm not one
[28:54] of them amen so if you're going to stay
[28:55] with that woman you need to find a
[28:57] preacher that'll accept you yeah because
[29:00] I said I won't right that's good because
[29:02] you and your wife both have been in a
[29:04] message You're supposed to reconcile
[29:05] with her brother said if your wife's
[29:07] going through the menopause can I just
[29:09] say I don't know if she's going through
[29:11] that if you ever stick with her right
[29:13] stick with her then amen she may go so
[29:15] you're not a Woman by the way
[29:20] you realize that
[29:23] if she's going through that she may go
[29:27] out and run with other men did you know
[29:29] he said that right he said now look if
[29:31] you ever stick with her stick with her
[29:33] then right okay
[29:35] do you know what Jesus Took you you were
[29:37] a fornicator
[29:40] were you living in sin were you born and
[29:44] said shaking
[29:47] what's so good come on why do you come
[29:49] why do you come like yeah
[29:53] and live a sorry life right come on and
[29:56] then you tell me I know I got the Holy
[29:58] Ghost
[30:00] you know in as a pastor you want to say
[30:02] you don't have a revelation of what the
[30:04] Holy Ghost says that's what you want to
[30:06] say but you can't beat everybody down
[30:08] I'm pretty tough but I'm to a point okay
[30:11] so Revelation 4 19 was the bride going
[30:14] up and coming down right 419 he says
[30:16] what's to the Jews right that's correct
[30:18] is that what he said right so what I did
[30:20] I preached the church ages and then I
[30:22] went to Daniel 70 weeks you know what my
[30:24] personal opinion is if you don't if
[30:26] you're the ministers in this message
[30:27] saying I don't mess with you know
[30:30] they've said it I don't mess what is
[30:32] that I don't that's what they in other
[30:35] words they're not they're not gonna make
[30:37] a mess out of it right
[30:39] so am I wrong if somebody help me I I
[30:43] think I know the English language I'm
[30:45] not going to mess with Daniel 70 weeks
[30:47] right is that what they say
[30:49] so you know what I say let's hear this
[30:51] out of the Bible
[30:52] yes if brother Ram's claw was right and
[30:55] it was and 419s to the Jews just tear it
[30:58] out because remember God only deals with
[30:59] the Jews at 490 years right exactly does
[31:02] everybody agree with me amen that's
[31:04] their that's their time set for
[31:06] redemption in the book
[31:09] I'm trying to tear it out now what they
[31:12] got left is one three and 19 and 22. now
[31:15] they're going to tear it out they're
[31:17] going to take out ten seven yeah which
[31:19] was the mighty angel that came down was
[31:21] that a Comey see there's a coming here
[31:24] right there's a coming here right and
[31:27] there's a coming here all right amen
[31:29] does everybody agree with that amen so
[31:31] now then do you understand what
[31:33] Revelation means it's the coming of
[31:36] Jesus Christ amen now you now look go
[31:39] read 10 7. he that Mighty Angel hands
[31:42] the book to you right right it did it
[31:45] say that you're going to go take the
[31:46] hand out of the angel that stood on land
[31:48] and sea and swore by himself right
[31:51] who is that Mighty Angel only Christ it
[31:53] could be
[31:55] you know what you take the book from
[31:57] them and the open book all right Glory
[32:00] you remember brother man said it's
[32:01] become a new book because why it's an
[32:04] open book The Seals have been taken off
[32:06] if the 17 was the coming of the Lord
[32:09] does everybody agree with that right
[32:10] amen I mean I'm looking everywhere
[32:15] because what did he what was the book
[32:17] that was open the book of redemption
[32:19] that's right and look and I told our
[32:21] church I had a guy that was coming for
[32:23] four weeks pulling from me good you know
[32:26] but I don't step around the message I'm
[32:28] gonna feed him the word he's either
[32:30] going to eat the whole book or he's not
[32:31] gonna make it anyway right right you're
[32:33] not gonna make the Rapture eating a half
[32:35] a book right you're not gonna make a
[32:38] well should I say that I'll say it
[32:41] but look if look if Daniel was sealed
[32:44] in 12 4 till the end time does everybody
[32:47] believe that exactly until they're gonna
[32:49] be running to and forever you see
[32:51] everybody running to the pro now right
[32:52] it's
[32:55] all right it's assigned to you we're at
[32:57] the end right right he said now we're
[32:59] gonna put seals on this until the end
[33:01] and they're gonna be running to and fro
[33:03] it's assigned to us right and he said
[33:05] you know what then we're gonna oh we're
[33:06] gonna reveal at the end time well look
[33:09] if you're eating the whole book are you
[33:10] gonna have to eat Daniel 7 weeks right
[33:12] man you take your brother to put that in
[33:14] the message for a filler are you kidding
[33:16] me
[33:18] come on do you know what If you deny
[33:20] Daniel 7 weeks you're taking part of
[33:22] this out and that's right and Revelation
[33:24] says if you add to or take away from
[33:26] this book right right your part will be
[33:29] taken out exactly the pledge will be
[33:31] added to you you understand all right
[33:32] I'm not causing the doctor and I'm not
[33:34] saying the doctrine of Daniel 7 weeks
[33:37] I'm telling you Daniel said it's part of
[33:39] the book all right so you gotta eat that
[33:42] you gotta eat the Rapture book you got
[33:44] to eat spoken words original seeds you
[33:46] got to eat the church there's people
[33:47] won't even pick up the church age book
[33:49] because they said Lee Bell Road yeah
[33:51] well that's Lee boy it's libel it's a
[33:53] commentary Brotherhood said read my book
[33:56] and you'll understand it better that's
[33:58] right that's what he said and people in
[34:01] the message don't open the seals they
[34:03] don't open that do you know what they're
[34:05] doing they're taking their part out
[34:06] they're taking their part out you take
[34:08] your part out Let Me Tell You Folks you
[34:10] better eat the whole book amen already
[34:11] the whole book and that's what the plan
[34:14] and Redemption is all about right and so
[34:17] I started this plan every day I preached
[34:19] eight times when I finally told the
[34:20] church Wednesday night I gotta end it
[34:22] because look if you preached every if
[34:25] you said I'm going to preach on
[34:26] Redemption Church part one he'll be
[34:29] preaching the rest through eternity
[34:31] Redemption because the whole book is
[34:34] Redemption all right I find what I did I
[34:36] started in chapter five I circled around
[34:39] and this fellow was coming to the church
[34:41] all excited pulling I could feel him
[34:43] pulling you know who is you know how I
[34:45] know right I can lift your face yeah
[34:47] that woman smiling she knows she agrees
[34:50] with what I'm saying some of you were
[34:52] like I want a pickle yeah I told our
[34:55] church does it somebody tell me what a
[34:56] good apartment pickle is that's right I
[34:59] have never heard what good a book is on
[35:01] the pickle right your body will respond
[35:03] to the ministry and I'm going to tell
[35:05] you in verse 5 of Revelation when you
[35:08] get what Redemption really is you're
[35:11] going to be a happy happy Church
[35:18] you're gonna come in here going holy
[35:21] holy crap holy under the Lord
[35:24] but you come in here like a bunch of
[35:27] dead beats whatever you come for what
[35:29] you're getting dead right exactly right
[35:32] yes Lord I'm hard aren't right but I'm
[35:35] not hard I love you do you know what
[35:38] chapter three I got through the book
[35:39] around chapter three it says those I
[35:41] love I rebuke right if you've got a
[35:43] preacher it won't rebuke you he ain't
[35:45] preaching chapter three
[35:47] now let me tell you something you rebuke
[35:49] rebuke and they got to repent right and
[35:51] then forgiveness right you know what it
[35:53] says in that scripture you're supposed
[35:54] to forgive a man seven times seven have
[35:57] you ever really read it close
[35:59] have you ever read it said rebuke them
[36:01] and if they repent forgive them
[36:04] all right now I hear people say oh just
[36:06] forgive them now I don't disagree with
[36:08] that but they've got to repent all right
[36:10] the condition of repentance
[36:14] right of forgiveness is him repeatedly
[36:17] exactly that's what justification is
[36:19] repeated right I told him does everybody
[36:21] know in Acts 2 38 it shows justification
[36:24] occasion baptism that one verse what do
[36:27] you have to do repent is that
[36:28] justification he said and be baptized in
[36:31] water that's what you do right right
[36:33] that's an outward show of an inward work
[36:35] now that's something you do
[36:45] there's your three parts program never
[36:48] change that that's right remember that's
[36:50] my message right that is the Plan of
[36:52] Redemption and it goes through the whole
[36:54] book is everybody okay with it so 19 and
[36:58] 22 I haven't got there yet I'll be
[37:00] honest with you but what is it they're

[37:07] New Earth right and I'm gonna get into
[37:08] that okay amen and then when I do that I
[37:12] have preached all of Revelations right

[56:32] right let's eat the whole book right and
[56:35] we'll get out of here all right if
[56:37] you're just eating part of it and your
[56:38] name's on the book we're gonna stay here
[56:39] until you eat it all right right I'm
[56:42] gonna be here you eat it all right right
[56:44] and that's okay but let's start eating
[56:46] can we do that all right
[56:49] good Lord yes
[56:53] and this story was written in all the
[56:56] old manuscripts when they were
[56:57] segregating the Bible the holy men when
[57:00] they were trying to put it together in
[57:01] the Old Testament The Book of Ruth was
[57:03] one of the outstanding books
[57:06] that they accept it and why it is just a
[57:09] love story why it's just a love story
[57:12] why would writers in ancient sages
[57:14] accept the book as inspired
[57:17] right that was a condition
[57:19] of them putting it into in the Bible
[57:21] does anybody understand that right if
[57:23] they didn't judge it to be inspired they
[57:24] couldn't put it in there right remember
[57:26] in Hebrews 1 what did Paul say
[57:29] it's hundred times
[57:30] God at sundry times moved on to prophets
[57:33] under what inspiration right the Bible
[57:36] was written by inspiration that's what
[57:38] he's saying here right so those old
[57:40] sages put it in there because they
[57:41] thought it was inspired right right
[57:43] right so the Holy Ghost had to move on
[57:45] them too right okay right because listen
[57:49] Sage is acceptable as inspired because
[57:52] there's a hidden revelation in the Book
[57:56] of Ruth there's a hidden revelation
[57:59] right everybody got that
[58:00] and in this hidden revelation you can
[58:03] catch the real meaning
[58:05] the true meaning right and it'll bring
[58:08] you you
[58:10] you
[58:11] real close to God right amen you it's
[58:17] only you okay let's go to the Book of
[58:19] Ruth is going to bring you real close to
[58:21] God yes okay

[58:25] that God will catch every heart so
[58:29] Spellbound
[58:31] I'm going to tell you that's what I am
[58:32] this morning I'm so Spellbound by this
[58:34] man I just oh when I when I was in my
[58:37] back office at church I would just weep
[58:39] I mean it just it just tore me up but
[58:42] you know what there was one day Johnny
[58:43] was weeping yeah yeah right you know why
[58:46] yeah
[58:47] you seen there was a kid's been redeemed
[58:49] right that's exactly John wasn't right
[58:51] wasn't weeping because his name was on
[58:53] the book
[58:54] John was weeping because he seen a man
[58:58] that was worthy right he caught a
[59:00] revelation of the Kinsmen Redeemer all
[59:02] right let me use another example here
[59:04] job you know Joe has anybody suffered
[59:08] like job in the church
[59:09] raise your hand please
[59:12] none of you have right do you know why
[59:16] job suffered so much
[59:18] because God wanted to get him a
[59:19] revelation right right
[59:21] I know what really cool that's right
[59:23] brother you know why you suffer no no
[59:26] God's trying to bring you a revelation
[59:29] and you're so dense you won't get it
[59:33] it's your fault yeah right everybody get
[59:37] what I'm saying all right amen the
[59:39] reason you suffer is because you're a
[59:41] heady high-minded outfit you live at
[59:44] laodicea we know everything we're the
[59:47] most educated people that's ever been on
[59:48] the Earth but we can't keep it simple
[59:52] right right yes so why did Joe go
[59:55] through all that he went all his friends
[59:58] accused him yep he went through boils on
[1:00:01] his gums are you kidding me yeah has
[1:00:04] anybody here had a boil on your gum
[1:00:07] that's where your teeth are sister I'm
[1:00:09] not talking in here I'm talking on your
[1:00:11] teeth all right that's rough folks
[1:00:14] and if I didn't have to eat it'd be
[1:00:15] rough look at me and tell that all right
[1:00:17] amen so do you understand with Joe and
[1:00:20] you know what job finally seen listen to
[1:00:23] what he did listen to what got job off
[1:00:25] the ashy brother Randolph said he was
[1:00:27] sitting on a sheep there was the
[1:00:29] Thunders and the Lightnings does
[1:00:31] everybody agree and he caught a
[1:00:33] revelation yeah
[1:00:35] when is the Thunders
[1:00:37] Mysteries is that why until you know the
[1:00:40] seal is that what he's saying all right
[1:00:41] he's previewing you that and job he's
[1:00:44] telling you the story of redemption I
[1:00:46] understand the Thunders and the
[1:00:48] Lightnings joke out of Revelation and he
[1:00:50] stood up off that edge he said I know
[1:00:52] who lives My Redeemer liveth liveth and
[1:00:56] in my flesh I shall see him the greatest
[1:01:00] Revelation that job could have gotten
[1:01:02] his entire life was that of a redeemer
[1:01:05] right right now look he knew it had to
[1:01:07] be a Kinsman not sure he got to revelate
[1:01:10] the greatest Revelation that he could
[1:01:12] get was of the Redeemer and of
[1:01:15] Redemption all right because that's the
[1:01:17] whole book everybody you understand I
[1:01:19] can go through the whole scripture you
[1:01:21] know Moses when he went up to the
[1:01:23] burning bush he said take off your shoes
[1:01:25] that's right do you know it was
[1:01:27] accustomed at Israel when they were
[1:01:28] doing the work that Kinsman redeemed we
[1:01:29] had to take off with his shoes
[1:01:31] I'm gonna tell you something you might
[1:01:33] not have seen everywhere you see feet in
[1:01:35] the Bible is who speaks of redemption
[1:01:37] blessed are the
[1:01:39] feet right
[1:01:42] what is the gospel Redemption
[1:01:45] in that image of Daniel where did that
[1:01:48] stone hit him right right you know what
[1:01:51] it's telling you it's the time of
[1:01:53] redemption Glory look up your Redemption
[1:01:56] it's near
[1:01:59] everywhere I can show you that in the go
[1:02:01] to Psalms there's a scripture I'm
[1:02:03] quoting a lot of them or I'd have to
[1:02:04] waste time to do but in Psalms it's
[1:02:07] talking about redeem and then it talks
[1:02:08] about feet do you know what feet is it's
[1:02:11] your balance yep
[1:02:12] if you got Redemption you're gonna have
[1:02:14] a balance in the message exactly does
[1:02:17] everybody understand try it try it but I
[1:02:18] did it the other day
[1:02:20] watch me
[1:02:22] watch me
[1:02:23] I can't do it very long God gave you two
[1:02:26] feet right how many parts is Redemption
[1:02:28] all right okay in and out right God knew
[1:02:33] what he was doing when he designed you
[1:02:34] right he wants you to be balanced
[1:02:36] brother all right we want you to keep a
[1:02:38] balance in the message hey if you got
[1:02:40] Redemption you're going to have you know
[1:02:41] what God hates a skill that doesn't have
[1:02:43] balance right right yeah right that's
[1:02:46] you all right you're supposed what does
[1:02:48] the scale do at judges you're supposed
[1:02:50] to be balanced he hates it when you're
[1:02:51] not balanced the whole book brother the
[1:02:54] whole book's talking about Redemption
[1:02:56] just open up it just is amazing don't
[1:02:59] you see Jesus in every chapter every
[1:03:01] verse everybody he is the Kinsman
[1:03:04] redeemers
[1:03:05] Bible is about Redemption the whole book
[1:03:08] and that's what you look every Prophet
[1:03:11] every Sage wanted to be sitting right

[1:09:26] from the eyes of the wise and prudent
[1:09:27] and we'll reveal it unto babes such as

[1:10:14] the woman listen listen close the woman
[1:10:17] said if if I can Touch the Hem of His
[1:10:19] Garment I know right
[1:10:21] I'll be healed do you know what she had
[1:10:24] a revelation amen she said if I could
[1:10:26] just touch and she did everything she
[1:10:28] could was she healed
[1:10:32] now look your wife that letter she's
[1:10:35] going to love him you're going to love
[1:10:37] Jesus Christ amen right but you're also
[1:10:39] going to know him you're going to have a
[1:10:42] revelation do you understand that yeah
[1:10:44] and let me tell you what a revelation
[1:10:46] did you know what brother and I may say
[1:10:47] yes I may be ahead brother Ram said love
[1:10:50] is confidence all right if you got
[1:10:53] confidence in your husband you love me
[1:10:54] if you don't you don't really love me
[1:10:56] that's right
[1:10:57] do you know God has confidence in you
[1:10:59] brother Glory
[1:11:01] he's counting on you
[1:11:04] he loves you and he has confidence and
[1:11:06] you're going to do what he said
[1:11:08] that's the kind of he put He has so much
[1:11:10] confidence you put your name in a book
[1:11:12] that's confidence
[1:11:14] so you know what it's love first of all
[1:11:17] she loves you
[1:11:19] second of all she knows it see that you
[1:11:22] could say you know what scripture says
[1:11:24] you can know all the Mysteries come on
[1:11:27] is it that no one but if you have not
[1:11:31] charity right you're like a tinkly
[1:11:35] you're just a noisy person in a message
[1:11:37] church right right so see you can you
[1:11:41] can I know
[1:11:42] but you gotta love him right remember
[1:11:44] the first part of what it's quote is
[1:11:45] here she loves me
[1:11:48] and she knows me there's what it takes
[1:11:51] for you you understand right he's
[1:11:53] talking about the kids with Redeemer
[1:11:56] there's the part that you need to have
[1:11:58] brother you need to love him and you
[1:12:00] need to know him right right see if
[1:12:03] you're a friend if you're Ruth and
[1:12:05] you're a friend a free man tells a
[1:12:07] friend everything if some of you say
[1:12:09] this person in the Church of friend you
[1:12:10] tell them something they tell me that
[1:12:11] ain't free yeah
[1:12:13] as a Trader
[1:12:16] well it is
[1:12:17] so see Ruth was the friend of God
[1:12:20] Glory a Boaz and Boaz quickened her
[1:12:24] it's the honest it's the most Sublime
[1:12:27] Revelation chapter five but then he in a
[1:12:30] book doesn't go right back to Ruth right
[1:12:31] exactly sure so look at everything he
[1:12:35] says in chapter five
[1:12:36] he goes to Ephesians one number four
[1:12:39] through eleven those he did presents he
[1:12:41] for me right he puts your name in a book
[1:12:43] for the fact that's Redemption he's
[1:12:45] talking about Redemption all the way
[1:12:46] back there all right he knew what you
[1:12:48] would do and he made a way just like he
[1:12:50] did in Israel he gave him the land but
[1:12:51] he knew they had given up right come on
[1:12:54] he gave you the Holy Ghost he knew you'd
[1:12:57] still mess yourself up right yeah amen
[1:13:01] he's dead but he said but you know what
[1:13:04] I'm gonna give him Redemption all right
[1:13:06] so yeah okay you're in the land right
[1:13:09] you possess the land you got the Holy
[1:13:12] Ghost isn't that your Holy Ghost but
[1:13:14] you're still gonna mess up people think
[1:13:17] when you got the Holy Ghost you're Mr
[1:13:18] Perfect
[1:13:20] are you kidding me you can't perfect yes
[1:13:26] what's perfect what's in you
[1:13:28] it's going to get close now I'm going to
[1:13:31] tell you but you ain't gonna finally
[1:13:33] you're look this is what I told them the
[1:13:35] other day you know what people think the
[1:13:37] rebel what the Rapture is but it is
[1:13:40] brother man said it but what it is that
[1:13:41] we misinterpret it with our own theology
[1:13:44] brother I said the the Rapture is a
[1:13:46] revelation a singular you know what
[1:13:48] we're doing in master churches we're
[1:13:50] clowning around until we get that one
[1:13:51] Revelation come on when I get that
[1:13:53] Revelation somebody comes forth

[1:14:10] sit here day after day after day doing
[1:14:13] Daniel 70 weeks right I'm gonna do
[1:14:15] chapter four Revelation which is the
[1:14:16] rehearsal and Rapture is that what he
[1:14:18] said right
[1:14:20] chapter five most Sublime is that what
[1:14:23] he said which is a Plan of Redemption
[1:14:25] the greatest love story there is all
[1:14:27] right chapter five in the Book of Ruth
[1:14:29] right right but people sat here because

[1:16:43] everybody do me if I read the rest of
[1:16:44] Leviticus 25. you know what it goes into
[1:16:47] you can't treat a brother wrong if if I
[1:16:51] bought you out of hawk and you come back
[1:16:53] to pay me back if I build a barn on that
[1:16:55] land you're supposed to give me the over
[1:16:56] plus yeah
[1:16:58] you're not supposed to spend a deal on
[1:17:00] me right you know what you know what I
[1:17:02] call them brother-in-law deals yeah
[1:17:03] anybody ever dealt with your
[1:17:05] brother-in-law I have and never come out
[1:17:08] right for me I'm going to tell you
[1:17:10] there's some people in the message that
[1:17:12] have pulled some brother-in-law deals
[1:17:13] and that I'm going to tell you something
[1:17:15] and you may think I'm funny and I'm
[1:17:16] being hard but if you're a part of
[1:17:18] redemption you ain't gonna spend a deal
[1:17:20] on a brother right right you're gonna
[1:17:22] love everybody yeah it's the greatest
[1:17:25] love story look if you love your brother
[1:17:29] could you take his wife
[1:17:31] no
[1:17:32] that's right come on remember Jesus said
[1:17:35] that the two Commandments it's all
[1:17:36] wrapped up right right love the Lord thy
[1:17:38] God
[1:17:39] and love your brothers yourself how
[1:17:41] could I take a man's wife
[1:17:43] if I love him right how could I steal
[1:17:46] his horse if I loved him right right you
[1:17:49] understand right so you tell me you've
[1:17:51] got the greatest story Redemption and it
[1:17:53] lives in you and you spit a brother
[1:17:55] wrong
[1:17:56] you need to get in an altar brother
[1:17:58] that's right I'm not saying you can't
[1:18:00] repent but we need to wake up right
[1:18:02] we've got so common with the message all
[1:18:05] we do is we come to church we hear him
[1:18:07] preach he does all your studying he does
[1:18:10] all your praying he's your pope whoever
[1:18:13] you are
[1:18:15] the scripture says to study to show
[1:18:17] yourself amen now that's what my Bible
[1:18:20] says Brethren said pray read your Bible
[1:18:23] every day
[1:18:25] see I told the church when I took it I'm
[1:18:27] not a pope
[1:18:28] I'm not going to do all your praying
[1:18:30] that's good I'm not going to do all your
[1:18:32] stuff if you do
[1:18:34] you do Pope and I'm never going to
[1:18:35] become a Poe right so I recommend that
[1:18:38] you start doing the bride I'm gonna say
[1:18:40] it again the bride hath made herself
[1:18:42] ready right you know what herself is
[1:18:44] exactly certification she's doing
[1:18:47] something all right sanctification is
[1:18:49] what you'd now do all right don't go
[1:18:51] crazy with me I understand we're
[1:18:52] Sanctified by the blood amen right right
[1:18:55] we understand that but if you go through
[1:18:56] all the quotes didn't Brethren say
[1:18:58] second patient serve me right I prove it
[1:19:01] rude I'm not I'm not clowning what I say
[1:19:02] that I could prove what I'm talking
[1:19:04] about so there is see Church
[1:19:07] wake up there is some Shake Yourself
[1:19:09] people please all right amen and realize
[1:19:12] there is something that you are required
[1:19:15] to do right
[1:19:16] it's a requirement God didn't put all
[1:19:19] these quotes out there for me and you to
[1:19:21] fight for me and you to fight a bunch of
[1:19:24] preachers for me and you to take a club
[1:19:26] and beat the brother up on the fourth
[1:19:28] row that's not what I'm here to do right
[1:19:30] right you understand but you know what
[1:19:32] if I got a pound of pound a square peg
[1:19:35] and a round hole to get you to get it
[1:19:37] I'm gonna get a bigger Hammer all right
[1:19:38] because we're gonna do it
[1:19:40] because you know what I want to see
[1:19:42] every one of you in this congregation
[1:19:43] man you know why I want you to make it
[1:19:46] because I love you right right if he
[1:19:49] loved the whole world
[1:19:52] why would I spit a bad deal I just you
[1:19:55] know I've seen so many bad deals in the
[1:19:57] message I've been here 27 years and I
[1:19:59] see I'm going to make your hair curl
[1:20:01] right yeah you know it's rough like
[1:20:03] brothers treating brothers that way yeah
[1:20:05] you know since operated Leviticus 25 you
[1:20:08] know what I'm gonna say you spent a
[1:20:10] brother and I'm not talking about it
[1:20:11] brother I'm talking about they got the
[1:20:13] same father is everybody understand that
[1:20:14] right and you spin them wrong you do a
[1:20:17] raw deal on them I really doubt your
[1:20:20] Redemption all right can I just get it
[1:20:22] down to where we're living right I doubt
[1:20:24] your Redemption right if this guy is a
[1:20:26] preacher done a bad deal on you right
[1:20:28] yeah I would doubt where he's at you
[1:20:31] know I'm not saying he's lost but he
[1:20:33] sure needs to move up all right right so
[1:20:36] we we need to really we need to we need
[1:20:38] to slow down Brethren said if I can get
[1:20:40] this ride to slow down she she's not
[1:20:42] gonna be running to and from right
[1:20:43] chapter four is that what it says in
[1:20:45] Daniel let me run into and fro if I can
[1:20:47] hit this
[1:20:48] slow down I'm dressed yeah exactly
[1:20:52] yeah I'll get you the Holy Ghost you
[1:20:54] understand if you can slow down if you
[1:20:56] listen to this message and serve all
[1:20:58] right amen that's sanctification folks
[1:21:01] let's see what happens is they take the
[1:21:03] quote well justification or
[1:21:04] sanctification made way for which it is
[1:21:06] just in case you may wait the same case
[1:21:09] citation made away from baptism Holy
[1:21:11] Ghost and then that made a way for the
[1:21:12] person the person right right well so
[1:21:15] what they say is well I got the person
[1:21:17] what means they're not don't Justified
[1:21:18] anymore because you know it made way it
[1:21:20] did say it did away yeah right it didn't
[1:21:23] say it blocked it off right see what
[1:21:25] happens is we got a people out there
[1:21:26] don't know the message right right
[1:21:28] you're still supposed to be justified
[1:21:30] you're still supposed to be Sanctified
[1:21:32] living in everyday cleansed life right
[1:21:35] right sanctification is cleansing right
[1:21:38] right and you're supposed to live in
[1:21:40] every day simple Christian right
[1:21:43] Christian means christ-like by the way
[1:21:44] life
[1:21:46] and we missed it somewhere maybe we
[1:21:49] looked at all these great Revelations
[1:21:52] I know you have brother Samuel because
[1:21:55] it's the hour of it right I know brother
[1:21:57] Satan was a man of God I know I'm
[1:21:58] talking to him I know I know where he's
[1:22:00] at Amanda yes sir he's preaching all
[1:22:03] these great things and you can't live a
[1:22:04] little simple Christian Life right right
[1:22:05] you need to get yourself down an altar
[1:22:08] somewhere right you need to get yourself
[1:22:10] cleaned up that's what you need to do
[1:22:11] there's something you can do and you
[1:22:14] need to do it right right and I tell you
[1:22:16] that right is everybody okay with what
[1:22:18] I'm saying
[1:22:19] okay oh we just man we just don't forget
[1:22:23] the ditch from what you've been dubbed
[1:22:25] right yes all right
[1:22:28] Ruth a type of a Believer now okay
[1:22:31] what is the believer when she or he
[1:22:35] comes out now he's saying what's a
[1:22:37] Believer right now we're all saying I
[1:22:39] believe the message yeah right right
[1:22:41] let's see let's see by quote if you do
[1:22:44] when she or he comes out
[1:22:47] the person from the world
[1:22:50] yeah are you out of the world
[1:22:52] that's he comes in amongst Christian
[1:22:55] Believers so you got to separate your
[1:22:59] old junkie friends out there in the
[1:23:01] world and you know I see these young
[1:23:02] people that you know they really want
[1:23:04] they want it but they're not willing to
[1:23:06] separate from unbelief that is
[1:23:08] justification you've got to come out
[1:23:10] from the world of things right and to do
[1:23:12] that I hate to say it you're a Believer
[1:23:15] and believing this message is very much
[1:23:17] Associated to you all right yeah that
[1:23:19] guy out in the world drinking smoking
[1:23:20] running to women is very much associated
[1:23:23] with him right you can't run with a dog
[1:23:25] that's got fleas and not get fleas so
[1:23:28] the first thing is justification you've
[1:23:30] got to get yourself separated right
[1:23:31] right there are a lot of message leaders
[1:23:33] I hate separated yet folks I know some
[1:23:36] people say they believe the message I
[1:23:37] still smell smoke on them I never knows
[1:23:39] see this nose it smells good
[1:23:42] it is a good smelling nose and when I
[1:23:45] shake your head get a whiff of smoke
[1:23:48] constantly not once where you've been
[1:23:49] with somebody so I'm telling you tell
[1:23:51] off on yourself you really do
[1:23:53] you can't fool a preacher you fool a lot
[1:23:56] of people you ain't go full with this
[1:23:57] guy when she or he comes out the person
[1:24:00] from the world he comes in amongst
[1:24:01] Christian Believers women that used to
[1:24:04] smoke
[1:24:05] right
[1:24:06] drink and play cards and societies and
[1:24:09] so forth and have all listen to this now
[1:24:12] your sister don't get mad at me I didn't
[1:24:15] say it I'm just reading what he said
[1:24:20] he's talking about sister and have all
[1:24:22] kinds of fancy stuff
[1:24:26] huh he said I didn't
[1:24:29] all sorts of all kinds of fancy stuff
[1:24:32] and like some kind of a frizzed up bird
[1:24:36] hey yeah has anybody been to a message
[1:24:39] Church where you're sitting in the
[1:24:41] and you can't see over his sister's hair
[1:24:43] that's a frizzed up Bird come on you're
[1:24:47] laughing sister you're laughing you've
[1:24:48] been there haven't you have you been to
[1:24:50] a message Church where they got their
[1:24:52] frizzed up here and you can't see the
[1:24:54] guy you're going like this
[1:24:55] that's frizzed up sister I'll just give
[1:24:58] you the definition okay
[1:25:01] but now she's changed
[1:25:03] he's made a decision to go with God
[1:25:06] now she comes into a people that doesn't
[1:25:08] believe that kind of stuff a people yeah
[1:25:11] right right so whoever in here that's a
[1:25:13] Believer Christian but you don't believe
[1:25:15] that stuff right and when she comes in
[1:25:18] if she's you know I've got women
[1:25:20] sometimes come and wear pants do you
[1:25:21] think I preach pants Adam and do I look
[1:25:24] stupid
[1:25:25] no I preached salvation to her right but
[1:25:28] when they look around
[1:25:30] and all of our sisters are wearing dress
[1:25:32] all of our sisters haven't cut their
[1:25:34] hair all of our sisters doesn't wear
[1:25:37] makeup now brother you don't have to
[1:25:40] preach these things if these guys are
[1:25:41] living right exactly you don't have to
[1:25:43] if you'll live it right but if half of
[1:25:46] you on one side is all painted up like a
[1:25:48] jezebel got your hair all frizzed up it
[1:25:51] got jewelry one like you went through a
[1:25:53] magnet with a 10 cents towards a magnet
[1:25:55] on
[1:25:56] what do you think that sister's gonna
[1:25:58] get out of your life right what do you
[1:26:00] think she's going to go your life speaks
[1:26:02] louder than your words
[1:26:04] so you know what he's banking on you're
[1:26:06] going to be Christian Believers so when
[1:26:08] that guy comes in here they're going to
[1:26:10] see how you live and they're going to
[1:26:11] come back the next time and they're not
[1:26:13] going to wear it fast right and some
[1:26:15] women don't come once wearing pants
[1:26:16] they'll come twice but I've never seen
[1:26:19] them the third time right they're going
[1:26:20] that's right you know women look at
[1:26:22] women anybody I work
[1:26:25] I was in a group of 75 or three men in
[1:26:29] it
[1:26:30] and I want women when another woman goes
[1:26:32] by they'll go

[1:27:10] she separated out of the world you see
[1:27:12] what I'm saying she's coming amongst
[1:27:13] Believers and now she wants to be a part
[1:27:15] right that's what sanctification is you

[1:27:26] pilgrim she doesn't know their Customs

[1:27:33] coming to Israel then women
