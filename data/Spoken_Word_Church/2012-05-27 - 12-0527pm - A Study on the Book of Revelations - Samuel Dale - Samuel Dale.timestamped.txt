[0:00] oh
[0:21] you know as many times as moses had
[0:24] come
[0:26] so close to god
[0:29] but you know he still wanted to see
[0:32] you know what god allowed him to see
[0:35] sure he got to see the back part but
[0:38] he got to see
[0:39] something
[0:40] i mean good to see everybody in the
[0:42] house the lord if you'd like to turn in
[0:43] your scriptures turn to revelations one
[0:47] we're going to start a series kind of on
[0:49] the study of the book of revelations
[0:51] but this is actually leading up to
[0:54] uh revelations 5 where we really want to
[0:57] get to and speak a while in revelation 5
[0:59] and revelation 6. but i want to get this
[1:02] part
[1:03] anchored real good in you to have a
[1:06] better understanding you know of
[1:09] what we're talking about
[1:11] but
[1:12] we just pray that the lord will bless
[1:13] those who are terrible brother mark
[1:15] brother don and then we're coming back
[1:17] home i think starting out today and
[1:19] traveling and then coming home from
[1:21] there and wait in june we'll be there
[1:22] for a week and coming home on monday of
[1:26] after
[1:27] this not just coming monday but the next
[1:29] one
[1:29] and so this little vacation time so just
[1:32] pray for these the lord would would take
[1:34] care of him and all that amen
[1:36] revelations one
[1:38] the only father we thank you lord most
[1:40] of all for you being our father
[1:43] being the one that would lead us and
[1:45] goddess that you'd give us eternal life
[1:48] that you'd come down and dwell among us
[1:50] you'd make a way that we might receive
[1:52] your life into our our being that we
[1:54] could rest in you and be your children
[1:56] be your offspring and we pray that you
[1:59] would just bless each one lord and
[2:01] remember you promised you'd heal us
[2:04] and lord we thank you for it
[2:06] you said you sent your word and you
[2:08] healed us and delivered us from
[2:09] destruction so we thank you and we ask
[2:11] you to just have your way now as we read
[2:13] your word
[2:14] as we talk about you you come on the
[2:16] scene and
[2:17] lord open our eyes that we may see truly
[2:20] open the eyes of our heart lord because
[2:22] that's what we need we love you and we
[2:24] thank you forgive our sins cleanse us
[2:26] and keep us in jesus name
[2:29] amen
[2:31] revelations 1
[2:34] 1-3
[2:39] so the revelation of jesus christ which
[2:41] god gave unto him
[2:43] to show unto his servants things which
[2:45] must shortly come to price
[2:47] and he said and signified it by his
[2:49] angel and to his servant john
[2:51] who by record of the word of god and the
[2:53] testimony of jesus christ
[2:57] and of all things that he saw blessed is
[2:59] he that readeth and they that hear the
[3:01] words of this prophecy
[3:03] and keep those things which are written
[3:05] therein for the time
[3:07] is at hand you may deceive the lord that
[3:10] is blessing
[3:11] to the reading of the word now i want to
[3:16] get like i said a few things
[3:19] to our hearts and minds and our thinking
[3:21] and then we will be speaking from
[3:23] revelations 5
[3:25] and going on into revelation 6. brother
[3:28] brown actually says that
[3:30] in revelations 5 he said this is the
[3:32] opening of those seals
[3:34] in revelations 5.
[3:36] so then you know we need to
[3:38] uh get an understanding and maybe we'll
[3:40] get down to that eventually i'm kind of
[3:42] slow but
[3:43] and i'll get there you know like that i
[3:46] hope you enjoyed this morning
[3:48] and actually trying to bring out some
[3:50] points that are on it
[3:52] but you know
[3:53] you get so much packed in until i didn't
[3:56] get the part of the message that i
[3:57] wanted
[3:58] uh to get to because see i believe that
[4:01] jesus christ had the resurrection sign
[4:05] not only that he was raised in the dead
[4:07] that was it you know but he had the word
[4:11] that would raise the dead
[4:12] right because he was that word all right
[4:15] and he could raise the dead and see that
[4:16] was the sign of the resurrection
[4:19] preceding the coming
[4:22] of the point to where that he would pay
[4:23] the price and do all of the things and
[4:26] that would be the sign of the
[4:27] resurrection we'll then see brother
[4:28] brown coming in the last days
[4:30] and you know like i've always told you
[4:33] then you don't find paul peter john and
[4:35] him writing other than matthew mark luke
[4:38] and john now's writing about the son of
[4:40] man because that was writing at the time
[4:42] but you don't find any of the apostles
[4:44] speaking of even paul with the greatest
[4:47] of understanding
[4:48] he never mentions the son of man
[4:51] because that was not for their time it
[4:52] was not an understanding for them but
[4:54] then you hear brother adam starting out
[4:56] in the first part of his ministry you
[4:58] know and he's talking about the son of
[5:00] man
[5:01] and he's talking about the sign of the
[5:02] son of man
[5:04] all right and see the sign of the son of
[5:06] man was the fact of the word being
[5:09] brought back
[5:10] to the position
[5:12] to where that he could stand there and
[5:15] and declare those things and the dead
[5:17] would be raised because of the opening
[5:19] of the word and that would be you know
[5:21] the point so you know and i see i
[5:24] believe this message is the
[5:27] resurrection message
[5:29] now this message the prophet that is
[5:31] brought unto us that is the resurrection
[5:33] message all right so then we're not
[5:36] looking for something to come to uh
[5:40] change us
[5:41] no more than we were talking about this
[5:42] morning the prophet saying your
[5:44] resurrection
[5:45] is inside of you
[5:47] all right
[5:48] all we need to do is just get it outside
[5:50] of us right
[5:51] i mean that's as plain as we could be
[5:53] and it's shortened terms but we need to
[5:55] get it into manifestation and to me
[5:57] that's the statue of a perfect man the
[5:59] things the prophet taught or what we we
[6:02] need that but i just you know i didn't
[6:03] have time to bring it
[6:05] and all but
[6:06] they said richard said to run out of
[6:08] batteries said was taking
[6:09] an hour battery trying to stretch it for
[6:11] an hour and a half so
[6:13] they suggested that not that i get
[6:15] another battery so you can figure on the
[6:17] rest of it
[6:22] but now
[6:23] let's just think about it
[6:25] you know
[6:26] the book of revelations is a great thing
[6:28] and i will repeat this repeatedly
[6:31] throughout the message
[6:32] not today as much but as we're going
[6:34] along in the series
[6:36] because you know what i believe
[6:38] the
[6:40] brother brown says in the church age
[6:41] book
[6:42] that page 13
[6:44] and i won't use it here we'll do it
[6:46] later
[6:48] that this is the only book in the bible
[6:50] whereas that jesus christ himself
[6:54] appearing personally to ascribe to right
[6:58] all right so then there were we read you
[7:00] know this is a revelation that god give
[7:02] to jesus
[7:03] to give to john that's not
[7:04] trinitarianism that's not no forms of
[7:07] that it's just uh the basis of what was
[7:09] actually taking place
[7:11] and and in doing that then we'll see uh
[7:14] you know what it is
[7:16] in in the understanding
[7:19] all right
[7:20] and and follow it a little closer but
[7:22] it's the only book the prophet said that
[7:25] whereas jesus personally appearing to a
[7:27] scribe all right then if that's what
[7:30] happened there
[7:31] then he's writing but he's writing as we
[7:33] read in just a second he's writing about
[7:35] himself in the church
[7:38] now you find nowhere and i ask you to do
[7:41] this you can find it you find nowhere in
[7:44] the book of revelations
[7:46] you find no place that jesus christ is
[7:49] by himself
[7:52] all right
[7:52] now i want you to show it to me if you
[7:54] can find it
[7:55] uh you know through the opening of the
[7:57] seals through the different things and
[7:59] showing that it'll take place and work
[8:00] takes place and all that but he's never
[8:02] shown by himself
[8:06] because it's the book written but it's
[8:08] the book written about
[8:11] him in his church
[8:15] all right
[8:16] now so then i preached a series back
[8:18] quite a while ago on a little thing to
[8:21] uh let you know that it was
[8:23] showing it that
[8:26] in that book
[8:28] he appears
[8:30] in the people or with the people
[8:32] mainly in the people it's very rarely
[8:35] you'll see him mentioned about him even
[8:37] being there it's him in the people
[8:40] to reveal himself
[8:43] and it's a future book so then it's your
[8:45] book
[8:47] you remember a preaching that series
[8:48] owner called it the bride's book
[8:51] see the book of revelations is actually
[8:52] our book if you want to know where
[8:54] you're at read the book of revelation
[8:56] of course we were told by mankind you
[8:58] can't understand this you can't
[9:00] understand that stay out of the book of
[9:01] revelation
[9:03] all right i'll read it to you in a
[9:04] minute why that that has been said to us
[9:07] you know
[9:08] to stay out of those things because
[9:11] satan don't want you to realize who you
[9:12] are and what's going on
[9:14] so if you was to tell me said brother
[9:16] dale i want to take away
[9:19] everything you've got
[9:21] and you're going to prison etcetera or
[9:23] whatever you're going to do put them on
[9:24] all the patents and beyond wouldn't make
[9:25] no difference
[9:27] but
[9:27] uh
[9:28] you're only going to be allowed to take
[9:31] one book
[9:32] well naturally we would say the bible
[9:34] but then it's okay now you're going to
[9:36] be allowed to take one book out of the
[9:38] bible
[9:39] you know well i take the book of
[9:40] revelation
[9:42] i mean i would
[9:44] because in that
[9:46] i could find myself
[9:48] because i know it's talking about me
[9:51] all right
[9:52] it's not talking about somebody else
[9:54] it's not talking about what paul and him
[9:56] could prophesy and they were speaking
[9:57] personal for the hour they were living
[9:59] but this is the message straight to us
[10:01] and we thank god for that all right now
[10:05] see as i said people have taught us
[10:08] to stay out of the book of revelation
[10:12] because we can't understand it
[10:14] you got these symbols you've got all
[10:16] these things in there well
[10:20] we've had a prophet to come down and
[10:21] tell us what these things mean
[10:25] all right
[10:26] so thank god for the prophet
[10:29] to bring the message
[10:31] and if you notice in revelations 1 there
[10:34] that we were reading
[10:35] it says the prophecy
[10:39] the words of this prophecy
[10:43] all right
[10:44] and see i gave it to you so go ahead
[10:46] brother uh joe and pull up remember
[10:49] anderson
[10:50] no he's not that okay we got another one
[10:52] today who's that
[10:54] joey
[10:54] book number one
[10:56] i'd just like to give you these things
[10:58] where you can look at them because
[10:59] remember as i said the other day about
[11:01] the messenger see we talk about prophecy
[11:04] prophecy our prophecy
[11:05] all right p-r-o-p-h-e-c-y
[11:08] prophecy
[11:09] that's what's written in revelation
[11:11] there all right
[11:13] p-r-o-p-h-e-s-y
[11:15] is more or less like the prophet
[11:17] speaking
[11:18] you know i mean god's speaking through
[11:20] somebody
[11:22] all right you know
[11:23] and and do it but the word prophecy
[11:27] is more or less and the best way i can
[11:28] give you the definition the way i see it
[11:31] is prophecy is a
[11:33] unfolding or are are gathering together
[11:37] to show us
[11:38] what's in the book
[11:40] all right see it's unfolding of the book
[11:43] because it's the prophecy
[11:45] all right and see then you'll see here
[11:46] it says prophecy
[11:48] which is from the greek word 43 94
[11:50] in other words a discourse emitting or
[11:53] in other words a
[11:54] a message or a wording that you're
[11:57] bringing forth that's the prophet is
[11:59] prophesying see
[12:01] to do all right but the word prophecy is
[12:04] a discourse a meaning remember you
[12:06] pronounce the words
[12:07] from divine inspiration and declaring
[12:09] the purposes of god
[12:11] see so it's a setting in order of
[12:13] scriptures
[12:17] all right so you can see then that the
[12:19] prophet of god
[12:21] the one we believe in the end time
[12:23] god gave him
[12:25] this to say to us
[12:27] and what he's given unto us the message
[12:29] then is a prophecy p-r-o-p-h-e-c-y
[12:34] because it's a setting in order of the
[12:36] scriptures all right
[12:39] it is not just a man saying things
[12:43] all right so you see what it's doing is
[12:44] a discourse in meaning from divine
[12:46] inspiration and declaring the purposes
[12:48] of god
[12:49] whether by reproving
[12:51] or admonishing the wicked are
[12:53] confronting the afflicted are revealing
[12:56] things hidden
[12:57] all right
[12:59] whatever it be then let it be that now
[13:02] as to come forth the a prophecy
[13:07] see then don't get into it and say
[13:08] prophecy prophecy you know i'm just
[13:11] trying to do that the word to give you
[13:12] an understanding
[13:14] of prophecy so thank god
[13:17] see without the prophet now listen
[13:21] without the prophet to explain expound
[13:24] the word
[13:25] or to take this book
[13:28] of prophecy
[13:30] and speak upon it and unveil it or
[13:34] reveal it
[13:35] see then the
[13:36] the
[13:37] uh denominational systems is right are
[13:39] the people that don't get in the book of
[13:41] revelation
[13:43] see because you don't understand what
[13:46] the symbols are that's right but we have
[13:48] had a message to bring it to where we
[13:50] can understand what is being said if you
[13:53] want to know what's what this means
[13:56] then just go look up the prophet you
[13:58] know see what he says that it means
[14:01] and then just say well that's it and
[14:03] what always caught me because that was
[14:05] the thing that caught me when i came
[14:07] into the message was
[14:09] it was a
[14:11] a man
[14:12] that god could use to do all those
[14:14] things
[14:15] but yet he could explain things so
[14:17] simple
[14:19] that i could understand it
[14:23] you know
[14:24] a child can understand
[14:27] what the bible means the book of
[14:29] revelations
[14:30] means why because a prophet has
[14:32] expounded it so simple yes
[14:36] why why didn't we read it that way
[14:39] you know
[14:40] why didn't we read it that way to start
[14:42] with but see we had this big mind
[14:45] of the things that we've been taught
[14:48] see that you can't understand these
[14:51] things
[14:52] all right now
[14:54] i'm going to give you what the prophet
[14:55] had to say about it then so let's let's
[14:57] find out what he said
[15:00] but let's see who it's two and what it's
[15:02] about go ahead with number two a brother
[15:04] joe
[15:05] and i had to add these in
[15:07] and uh
[15:08] darren said we don't have no add-ons i
[15:10] said okay put it to the end i'll move to
[15:11] the front
[15:14] but
[15:15] in
[15:16] the on the church on the message the
[15:18] revelation of jesus christ now this is
[15:20] not in 60 1204 but it's not church
[15:22] anybody paragraph 80.
[15:24] it's all about when our lord and comes
[15:26] the earth and things
[15:27] and jesus said it's not for you to know
[15:30] this hour
[15:32] or time and talk about his second coming
[15:35] and no one would know that even the son
[15:38] as yet did not know you remember that in
[15:39] the scripture
[15:41] he said the son didn't know he didn't
[15:43] know about his coming all right but now
[15:45] read this very carefully with me
[15:48] you know i'm not going to be in no hurry
[15:49] about this
[15:50] uh ex you know trying to do the study
[15:53] because i'm gonna just tie it together
[15:55] for ken
[15:56] but look but after his death
[16:00] burial and resurrection
[16:02] and ascension into glory
[16:05] he speaking of jesus right receive from
[16:09] god the father
[16:11] of the church
[16:13] i mean god of god the future of the
[16:14] church
[16:15] all right and what
[16:17] he received from god the future of the
[16:20] church now the question is is the
[16:22] thought is about his coming
[16:25] right
[16:27] now he immediately puts his coming
[16:30] into church
[16:32] he's not speaking of a physical
[16:35] coming of the skies are opening up right
[16:38] see the prophet is immediately placing
[16:40] it in order to where he's talking about
[16:43] see but after his death burial
[16:45] resurrection see then you'll see
[16:47] why that it says that the revelation
[16:49] that god gave to jesus
[16:52] all right now jesus when he was hearing
[16:54] flesh
[16:56] sure he was almighty god in flesh
[17:00] but he was flesh too that's right all
[17:02] right so it was withholding from the
[17:05] flesh man
[17:07] you say well how in the world could that
[17:08] be because it was god well
[17:10] that's the best way to answer that is
[17:12] why would he say
[17:14] um
[17:15] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[17:16] because he has anointed me to preach to
[17:18] god why would he say that
[17:20] see that was revealed to him that day
[17:22] when he sat down he said this day
[17:24] this scripture is fulfilled
[17:27] all right so you said but yet he was
[17:30] he was almighty god that's true you have
[17:32] the holy ghost don't you
[17:34] you claim the new birth do you know
[17:35] everything
[17:37] oh what's wrong
[17:40] the holy ghost in you knows all things
[17:43] right
[17:45] but see there's a lot of problems
[17:46] getting that back out of earth from down
[17:48] inside up to the head
[17:50] and then the biggest problem is getting
[17:52] it from up in the head down into the
[17:53] heart
[17:54] so you know i'm just being honest that's
[17:57] the way jesus was
[17:58] see that he then when he was on earth
[18:00] that was withholding that's right
[18:03] all right but then after his death
[18:05] burial and resurrection now when he
[18:07] comes to john patency but after his
[18:09] death burial and resurrection and
[18:11] ascension into glory
[18:12] he received from god
[18:14] the future of the church then he
[18:16] returned back
[18:18] and watched to bring this message to the
[18:21] church now that's not the coming of the
[18:22] day of pentecost
[18:25] now that had to take place to where this
[18:27] could happen right that's right because
[18:29] you had to put the holy spirit within us
[18:30] to understand but that's not what he's
[18:32] talking about you return back to bring
[18:34] this message to the church and this
[18:36] message of is coming in the condition of
[18:38] the church is down to the age that's
[18:40] what's happening here
[18:42] in the book of revelation
[18:44] it's unfolding now what it's doing very
[18:46] simple in it
[18:47] he could not do it before his death
[18:49] burial and resurrection because he had
[18:51] not yet knew it
[18:54] but did you notice how the scripture
[18:56] reads here
[18:58] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[19:01] gave unto him
[19:03] christ
[19:05] he gave it unto him to bring down all
[19:07] right
[19:07] now watch how that god the father gave
[19:10] the revelation to his son jesus christ
[19:13] and he sent his angel to john to signify
[19:16] these things which was which
[19:19] which was which was which he is and
[19:21] which is shall be oh it's so beautiful
[19:24] you see it's beautiful all right
[19:26] now
[19:27] so it's not a trinitarian concept
[19:32] it's the fact of that while jesus was
[19:34] here on the earth
[19:36] there was things that was withholding
[19:38] from him
[19:39] that
[19:40] would be made known
[19:42] all right then he would have to come
[19:44] himself
[19:46] to personally appear
[19:48] to john to write
[19:51] all right and then appearing to john to
[19:53] write it it would be bringing forth the
[19:54] revelation to to us but what i want you
[19:57] to get is you missed the whole thing of
[20:00] one one point
[20:02] he's going to show his future point in
[20:04] the church that's right
[20:06] man
[20:07] because the church is going to be his
[20:09] coming that's right
[20:11] he didn't know when he was coming that's
[20:13] right right right i see we're thinking
[20:16] coming means a day oh yeah here it comes
[20:17] down out of the sky drop down
[20:19] no
[20:21] see his coming has been in motion
[20:23] since the day of pentecost
[20:25] the second coming i'm talking about
[20:28] easily to understand the first coming
[20:30] walked up on earth
[20:32] but the second coming of jesus christ he
[20:34] has where everybody's looking out there
[20:35] for it
[20:36] one of these days the sky's going open
[20:38] one of these days it's gonna happen
[20:40] no he's been coming for two thousand
[20:42] years yes
[20:46] see that's the second coming of jesus
[20:47] christ that's where people miss it
[20:49] that's right they're looking for some
[20:50] kind of a great to do horn and the
[20:52] different things that happen and see him
[20:54] walk down and all and see that's what
[20:56] they're taught
[20:59] but he started his second coming
[21:02] on the dead pentecost by the baptist by
[21:04] the holy cows
[21:05] all right
[21:06] now he's coming to john to explain this
[21:12] of what it would be
[21:15] and he explains the church ages right
[21:18] right chapter two and three
[21:20] then he goes through four five and then
[21:22] he goes through the the other things are
[21:24] showing the entirety of the future
[21:27] as it was said here to the church
[21:30] but he's going to show the church
[21:34] see that's what we're looking at we
[21:35] think that god's going to show the
[21:37] church something
[21:38] now god's going to show the church who
[21:40] she is
[21:42] that is something yeah
[21:45] that's the concern i want to be is who
[21:47] am i
[21:49] all right we sing a song who am i lord
[21:51] you know
[21:52] but
[21:53] see the second coming of jesus christ is
[21:55] not a physical
[21:56] corporal coming down that will happen
[21:59] but not as a physical that's right it
[22:01] never happens that way we meet him in
[22:03] the air we're going to meet the corporal
[22:04] body the prophet said
[22:06] in the area he does not set his feet
[22:08] back upon earth
[22:10] until the millennium all right
[22:13] so we're not looking for the physical
[22:14] coming
[22:15] that's why the prophet would say he said
[22:17] these people that say they got oil on
[22:20] their hand blood and oil and things like
[22:22] that he said they're saying that the
[22:24] second coming is already here
[22:28] you never heard brent around talking
[22:29] about oil and blood and things
[22:32] you didn't hear jesus paul or any of
[22:34] them talking about blood here and doing
[22:36] this and doing that
[22:38] no why because that would be making the
[22:42] physical coming that's right
[22:45] if you had the blood of jesus here
[22:46] doesn't mean he's physically here that's
[22:48] right
[22:49] you see that's not scriptural that's
[22:50] right
[22:52] because you're not going to be
[22:53] physically here
[22:54] we're going to meet him in the air we're
[22:56] going to a millennium and then when
[22:57] that's finished then he comes here
[23:00] and we come right back with it
[23:02] all right so then you'll see the point
[23:04] that what i'm trying to get at that
[23:06] it's it's god is going to reveal himself
[23:09] of his coming
[23:12] but he's doing it by showing you
[23:15] how his coming takes place
[23:18] you see you and i that's right
[23:22] you should you and i all right is that
[23:24] right now see that's why satan
[23:29] satan is the one see that's always said
[23:30] you can't understand the book of
[23:31] revelation you can't understand jensen
[23:34] huh why because it's the two books that
[23:37] shows
[23:39] his origin right
[23:43] in his ending
[23:47] right
[23:49] it shows its origin
[23:51] amen
[23:53] now it's easy to follow genesis as
[23:55] origin right and talk about satan you
[23:57] know when it created the anointed
[23:58] sheriff et cetera
[24:00] and then we can you know jump over but
[24:02] my point i want you to see is one thing
[24:08] the prophet god said that when jesus
[24:10] went up
[24:12] said he was there hanging on a cross
[24:15] he said judas was hanging on a cross
[24:18] right
[24:20] he said and
[24:22] satan took judas
[24:26] jesus went to hell but you know satan
[24:28] took jesus
[24:30] judas went to hell why because he
[24:32] rejected the word
[24:34] now but he said on the resurrection
[24:39] all right
[24:41] jesus rose
[24:44] all right
[24:45] but we don't watch there was another
[24:47] raising there because satan was going to
[24:49] start raising
[24:52] right
[24:54] okay
[24:55] now then on the day of pentecost
[24:57] the prophet
[24:58] said
[25:00] that jesus came back
[25:02] in the form of the baptism of the holy
[25:04] ghost
[25:05] he said and satan came back
[25:10] in the form of the antichrist
[25:13] all right
[25:14] so then everything god does satan
[25:16] follows it that's right
[25:19] that's why you notice in the bible that
[25:21] it doesn't talk about him being uh the
[25:24] the satanic cardinal until the later
[25:26] part of the book of revelation
[25:28] why because he don't know how to do it
[25:31] yeah
[25:32] i said it's true he has to follow god
[25:35] now brother said it like this one time
[25:37] he said he tops after god now he's not a
[25:39] type of god
[25:41] no no no he ties after god in other
[25:43] words he does what he does after god
[25:45] moves when god went up he went up when
[25:48] god come down he come down
[25:51] all right so then now we see him as the
[25:54] the point that he don't want this book
[25:56] of revelation to be understood that's
[25:58] right
[25:59] because it shows his origin
[26:03] all right
[26:05] and it shows his destruction
[26:08] so he hates the book of revelations
[26:11] because he doesn't like that part there
[26:14] that where he can see all right
[26:19] okay let's go to number
[26:21] two on your notes brother
[26:25] all right
[26:27] this is
[26:29] verse 14 church age book
[26:31] have you ever noticed how satan hates
[26:33] two books of the bible more than
[26:35] all others
[26:37] now watch through liberal theologians
[26:39] and how that pursuit of scientists
[26:42] against that weapon
[26:44] he's always attacking the book of
[26:45] genesis and the book of revelation
[26:48] now
[26:49] who's he attacking it he's always
[26:51] attacking it through the theologians and
[26:53] the
[26:54] the people see and then it comes down to
[26:56] the people
[26:58] right
[26:58] all right that's the deeds of nicholas
[27:00] we read in a second
[27:02] in both of these books we find satan's
[27:04] origin
[27:06] his awful
[27:07] ways and his destruction
[27:11] all right
[27:12] that is why he attacks them
[27:15] like i've always tried to tell you if
[27:17] the devil tries to tell you something
[27:18] about yourself just doing so well one of
[27:20] these days you're going to be destroyed
[27:24] you don't ever talk to him
[27:25] yeah
[27:26] oh you're
[27:28] i'm not going to like this one
[27:30] we spend 90 of our time talking to the
[27:32] devil and ten percent talking to god
[27:35] whether you like that or not
[27:37] oh i'll tell you what i don't talk to
[27:40] the devil
[27:42] no wonder he doesn't got you
[27:46] he only talks to the people he don't got
[27:49] is that good english yeah right
[27:52] in both of these we find satan's origin
[27:54] in awful ways and destruction that is
[27:56] why attacks him he hates to be exposed
[27:59] and in those books he is exposed for
[28:01] exactly what he is
[28:03] jesus said about satan he has no part in
[28:06] me and i have no part in him now listen
[28:09] that's something in it that's scripture
[28:11] the devil would like to prove that
[28:13] different
[28:16] now why
[28:17] would the devil like to prove
[28:21] that that statement that jesus says that
[28:23] he has no part with me why would he like
[28:25] to disprove that
[28:30] come on why would the prophet bring that
[28:32] out
[28:34] because you see the devil has always
[28:36] tried to make himself god right right
[28:40] and i've always told you and i believe
[28:41] it
[28:43] the devil he's a dummy i agree
[28:47] destructor you know destructive
[28:50] but he's also very smart
[28:51] the bible said he's wiser and daniel
[28:54] huh brother said don't tackle him
[28:58] that's what he said he said don't tackle
[28:59] him
[29:00] he said don't even tackle that good bad
[29:02] just steal ocean he said he'll tear you
[29:04] apart with a word
[29:07] but you see
[29:09] the devil
[29:11] he wants to get back where he was
[29:14] standing beside of the lord
[29:16] and he figures if he can get enough help
[29:18] on his side and if he ever makes it back
[29:20] to there
[29:22] then he may be able to conquer
[29:25] and take over yeah
[29:27] but you see what the prophet look what
[29:28] he's making to emphasis
[29:31] it exposes what he is jesus said he has
[29:34] no part in me and i have no part in him
[29:36] see if he can get some way connected
[29:38] back and get close and you know that
[29:40] brother around says that we
[29:42] call him jesus jesus
[29:45] and worship the devil
[29:49] now he didn't say if you call him father
[29:51] son holy ghost that's good anybody know
[29:53] that he said that comes the pits of hell
[29:56] but he said you can call him jesus jesus
[30:00] and worship the devil
[30:02] no i know who he is yeah i know i know
[30:04] how you make that out too
[30:06] you make that out like i always try to
[30:08] express it
[30:09] you ask people how they didn't know what
[30:11] that start oh he comes to me so sweet
[30:12] and so long
[30:14] the devil comes to me he's mad and
[30:16] horrible you know
[30:20] i have been told to sit down and shut up
[30:23] by the holy spirit
[30:26] and it certainly wasn't the devil
[30:28] telling me that
[30:30] because he was telling me the truth that
[30:31] i needed to quit crying like a baby and
[30:33] get him walk
[30:35] but you see that's what we think oh he's
[30:36] so sweet and humble
[30:39] he wasn't too humble when he planted a
[30:41] rope together and drove him out of the
[30:42] temple now they didn't think he was
[30:45] they thought the condo priest was jesus
[30:48] right
[30:49] they didn't think about that being god
[30:51] okay you know
[30:54] the devil would like to prove it
[30:55] different but he cannot so he does all
[30:57] he can to destroy confidence watch in
[31:00] the word
[31:04] when the church disbelieves satan and
[31:06] believes the spirit's revelation of the
[31:09] word
[31:10] the gates of hell cannot prevail against
[31:12] him
[31:15] see now he don't like it because it
[31:17] shows his destruction
[31:19] all right look
[31:21] now here is his origin we're not i told
[31:23] you a moment ago i said he seemed to see
[31:25] his origin in genesis because you don't
[31:27] talk about his creation
[31:29] but we're trying to move over into where
[31:30] we are in
[31:32] the study of the book of revelation so
[31:33] in the book of revelation watching
[31:35] origin
[31:36] revelation 2 6 for thou hast
[31:39] for this thou hast that thou hatest the
[31:41] deeds of the nicholas which i hate also
[31:44] that's bringing him into view because
[31:46] that's the deeds of the nicolas conquer
[31:48] the laity
[31:50] that's his origin in the new testament
[31:52] we'll see in a minute what he uses to do
[31:54] you're seeing it but a quote we gave he
[31:55] tries to discredit the word
[31:58] all right so then that's where he takes
[32:00] over to where what in the nicolaitans
[32:02] conquer the laity
[32:05] the
[32:06] what by perverting the word all right
[32:08] that's your origin which is destruction
[32:10] revelations 10 20 and 10 and the devil
[32:13] that deceived them that was cast into
[32:15] the lake of fire and brimstone where the
[32:18] beast and the false prophet are and
[32:20] shall be tormented day and night forever
[32:22] and ever the devil that deceived them
[32:24] was cast in two
[32:27] so that's just destruction
[32:29] so if he tries to tell you you ain't
[32:30] worth nothing say that one thing about
[32:32] it
[32:34] i can show you where you're going
[32:38] and what will be taken care
[32:40] of just talk to him he said oh i ain't
[32:43] going to talk to him why
[32:47] just tell him
[32:49] we use god's word
[32:52] because you try to use your own thoughts
[32:53] and everything
[32:55] you know it won't work look at the next
[32:56] one number three
[32:59] this is page 15 church eighth book or
[33:01] the revelation of jesus christ
[33:04] let me show you another reason why satan
[33:06] hates this book of the revelation of
[33:08] jesus christ in the church
[33:11] now you notice maybe you didn't
[33:12] understand my point one ago but just
[33:14] read it
[33:15] the book of revelation is the revelation
[33:17] of jesus christ's word
[33:20] in the church
[33:22] watch that
[33:23] he knows that jesus christ is the same
[33:25] yesterday and forever
[33:27] and he changes not right he knows that a
[33:30] whole lot more than do 90 of the
[33:32] theologians
[33:34] he knows that since god is immutable in
[33:37] his nature which means unchangeable you
[33:39] know he doesn't change
[33:41] then he is just as immutable in his ways
[33:45] thus satan knows assuredly that the
[33:48] original church at pentecost
[33:50] with the power of god mark 16 in action
[33:54] is the true church that jesus claimed as
[33:56] his own all else it's false it has to be
[34:02] see my point now get
[34:05] i like to keep making statements over
[34:07] and over
[34:09] it don't bother me they do you but
[34:14] see this revelation is the revelation of
[34:16] jesus christ
[34:19] well why why didn't in other words why
[34:21] didn't no
[34:23] this is what we think happened
[34:25] we think it's a revelation of jesus
[34:27] christ that god give to jesus to give to
[34:29] john this anger signifies you know huh
[34:32] see we think well this is a great
[34:33] revelation of jesus
[34:35] oh he's up into the heavens he's up
[34:38] there he's going to be on all of the
[34:39] stars the rainbows the moons of god and
[34:41] all and showing him up into the heavenly
[34:43] heavens and all of that
[34:48] but that's not what happened
[34:51] because he wasn't up there doing that
[34:54] then the time the book of revelation was
[34:56] written in 1895-96
[34:58] see he had already come back
[35:01] into the garage
[35:04] so where's he's coming oh it's wet and
[35:06] under one of these days the skies will
[35:08] split no i use i tell you what i used to
[35:10] think the kid somebody told me when you
[35:12] seen the coming of the lord you go out
[35:14] in the cloud and you look and they'd see
[35:15] a great big old a great big umbrella i
[35:18] never really understand how come up with
[35:19] that but there'd be a great big umbrella
[35:21] that would be out and he'd be hanging
[35:22] down on the bottom looking huh
[35:25] you know that's what i thought what'd
[35:27] you think
[35:30] but you see he's coming in his church
[35:33] you don't get nothing out of the message
[35:34] today get that point
[35:37] he's coming in his church
[35:39] and he's going to reveal himself in his
[35:41] church
[35:45] we think he's revealing himself to the
[35:47] church
[35:49] see that's about seeing the great
[35:50] victory where he is and all of what he
[35:51] does all these rainbows
[35:54] no
[35:56] he's revealing himself in his church
[36:01] that's what satan hates
[36:03] he don't want you to get the revelation
[36:06] of who you are
[36:07] better watch that clock now because i
[36:09] remember i started
[36:13] get the point now
[36:15] if you don't get nothing else
[36:17] get the point
[36:19] there's two things satan hates he hates
[36:21] the book of revelations in genesis
[36:23] because it shows his origin and his
[36:26] destruction
[36:28] all right
[36:30] now
[36:31] but truly the book of revelations shows
[36:34] jesus christ
[36:37] and where he's at
[36:40] and it proves his coming
[36:43] is a manifestation
[36:47] i believe in a corporal coming come on
[36:50] a physical coming right right
[36:53] and i know brother brown could see he
[36:55] said it this way he said he'd be so
[36:56] visible among us that he raised the dead
[36:58] and we'd go into rapture okay right
[37:00] but that's still not corporal
[37:03] that's not physical
[37:05] i seen you and i
[37:06] yeah but see the book of revelation
[37:10] shows jesus christ and where he's at
[37:15] and it shows his working in the church
[37:20] all right
[37:23] he doesn't like it
[37:26] for us to find out who we are
[37:29] right
[37:31] he don't like it
[37:34] all
[37:34] right now watch now let's get to number
[37:38] four at you know three go to number four
[37:41] because satan doesn't like this at all
[37:45] you don't want you to see this
[37:47] place 15 church books
[37:50] now remember this christ in the true
[37:52] church is a continuation
[37:55] of the book of acts
[38:00] now brother dale we we ain't nothing
[38:01] like the book of acts would black bear
[38:03] we don't let book of acts
[38:08] no
[38:11] but you don't want
[38:14] they wouldn't want to come down here
[38:15] where we're at and swap places with us
[38:20] they had pharisees and sadducees and a
[38:22] couple of herodians or something to put
[38:24] up with
[38:25] in the book of acts
[38:27] we got 969 that was a long time ago 69
[38:31] different denominations and 2 000
[38:33] denominations in this message
[38:35] i just a small number
[38:41] they said well we're a million followers
[38:43] of this message today thank god
[38:46] i thank god for every one of them
[38:51] he said well that's firm off your other
[38:52] flock well 1 million is a whole
[38:56] lot less than 7 billion
[39:00] so it would be fear not little flock if
[39:02] there was over a million going to
[39:04] rapture
[39:05] right
[39:06] that would still be and i can't even
[39:08] count that high can you i remember when
[39:10] we were from school they told us you'd
[39:11] take one dollar bills i forgot what the
[39:13] room was like a 12 to 12. and it took a
[39:15] million one dollar bill to lay them in
[39:17] and fill the room up
[39:19] you know
[39:22] boy thought back then you know who'd
[39:23] ever be a millionaire
[39:26] now you can have a million dollars today
[39:27] broke tomorrow
[39:30] right
[39:31] billionaires
[39:34] now what are they going to
[39:36] trillion
[39:38] what is in words we talking about the
[39:39] other day 10 mozillians
[39:42] we were trying to figure out what they
[39:43] were how many billion it takes to make a
[39:45] zillion how many are always trying to
[39:46] figure something on it
[39:48] but
[39:50] think about it church
[39:52] god is trying his best to get you and i
[39:54] see who we are he designated one whole
[39:57] book
[39:59] now surely we can understand
[40:02] that the gospels was written about the
[40:04] bride of christ
[40:05] paul and them writing peter and them and
[40:07] all the writing would about the bride of
[40:09] christ right
[40:10] but the book of revelations is a
[40:12] personal book
[40:14] that shows you and i
[40:16] and where we act
[40:18] and i like what he said see and i'll get
[40:20] through that if i have time just in the
[40:21] message if you don't we'll get to it
[40:23] wednesday now remember this
[40:26] christ in the true church is a
[40:27] continuation of the book of acts
[40:30] i've told you before when two brothers
[40:32] were said talking one time we were
[40:34] hunting and one of them said that the
[40:36] holy ghost wouldn't you didn't have no
[40:38] baptism with the holy ghost now and the
[40:39] other one said well the day i got the
[40:41] baptism from the holy ghost i fully
[40:42] adopted manifested son
[40:44] i said well one of you is on one end of
[40:46] the ladder on the other end of the
[40:47] ladder i'm going to try to stay in the
[40:48] middle somewhere
[40:51] no and i'm in it and i tried to express
[40:54] it
[40:54] brother brown said he met people who
[40:56] received the baptism of the holy ghost
[40:58] he said exactly like the day of
[41:00] pentecost
[41:03] now that's what your prophet said
[41:07] you see people say oh no the holy ghost
[41:09] ain't here well now right here what did
[41:10] he say
[41:12] christ in the true church
[41:14] is a continuation of the book of acts
[41:17] yes
[41:19] see we got the wrong way like my wife
[41:20] years ago she made a good point about it
[41:22] and i like to make the emphasis
[41:24] see it wasn't the the holy ghost that
[41:26] would be down in the ages you have no
[41:28] such thing as the holy ghost never age
[41:30] every age had the baptism in the holy
[41:32] ghost it was a word that was eat down
[41:36] it's the word to be restored
[41:39] right come on put it in the right order
[41:42] look but the book of acts shows how the
[41:44] antichrist
[41:46] spirit would come into the church and
[41:48] defile it now what's it doing
[41:51] making it look warm
[41:53] formal did i say something wrong
[41:55] coming to the church in the father
[41:57] making it look warm formal and powerless
[42:00] all right it exposes satan revealing his
[42:02] works what is revealing satan's work
[42:04] attempted destruction of god's people
[42:07] and the discrediting of god's word
[42:11] all right
[42:12] right down to the time he is cast into
[42:14] the lake of fire he fights that he
[42:16] cannot stand it
[42:18] he knows that if the people get the true
[42:20] revelation of the true church and what
[42:23] she is
[42:25] what she stands for and what she can do
[42:28] the greater works she will be an
[42:30] invisible army all right if they get the
[42:32] true revelation of the two spirits
[42:37] within the framework of the christian
[42:39] church
[42:40] now what's too spiritual
[42:45] me
[42:45] oh well that's the devil
[42:47] and god that's good
[42:50] that's good
[42:52] but just don't push them so far apart
[42:55] right
[42:58] see because that antichrist that white
[43:01] horse rider
[43:02] was so deceptive
[43:04] in the line of christianity we would
[43:07] call him until it deceived everybody
[43:13] until the prophecy came
[43:16] right
[43:19] the church that started out being
[43:22] the persecuted
[43:26] wound up being the persecutors
[43:29] but everybody's still going to heaven
[43:32] you know they're going to do away with
[43:32] hell if you read that they don't have to
[43:34] do away with because everybody going
[43:37] every time you go to a funeral they
[43:38] preach them to heaven well he got his
[43:39] place in hell and he cut this place
[43:40] again that's all right i hope they do
[43:43] i don't mind doing a little work if we
[43:44] don't spread it out i wouldn't mind
[43:47] but i just know it ain't gonna happen
[43:48] but look now
[43:50] get a true revelation of the two spirits
[43:56] that antichrist spirit is so close
[44:01] there is not but one thing
[44:03] you can deal with it about
[44:07] and the prophet of god said it's whether
[44:09] or not the spirit in you agrees with the
[44:11] word
[44:15] now greece means more than just agree
[44:17] that's right
[44:18] like i said this morning people agree
[44:21] and they say brother random brought us
[44:23] the grace of marriage and divorce and
[44:24] bless god i'm free i had three wives but
[44:27] now i don't have none i'm free and all
[44:29] this and the other
[44:32] but you know
[44:33] i just don't agree with his teaching
[44:37] no that's about as carnal as i can think
[44:40] about anything be
[44:42] if you're going to believe what he said
[44:44] on one thing why can't you believe it on
[44:45] another one all right now but see the
[44:48] two spirits
[44:51] see all the churches around the world
[44:53] how many what would you call how many um
[44:56] professing christians i remember at one
[44:58] time this is 20 30 years ago there was
[45:00] 500 million catholics i remember that
[45:03] but i remember reading i said 20 years
[45:05] ago
[45:06] how many uh so-called christians
[45:10] would it be today
[45:12] just a number one billion or seven would
[45:14] that be okay
[45:17] but you realize 1 billion would be
[45:21] a lot of people
[45:24] and everybody's going to heaven
[45:27] and everybody's going to be the bride
[45:31] right
[45:34] the badges of methodist
[45:36] telecasters the brown whites
[45:41] the luau eyes
[45:44] i don't ever mind saying i ain't
[45:46] preaching nowhere today i'm preaching to
[45:48] louise
[45:49] trying to get us converted to be
[45:50] christians
[45:54] but you see
[45:55] the two spirits yes
[45:59] how do you know that that's the holy
[46:01] spirit that's talking to you right
[46:06] how do you know
[46:09] you know how to try it you can't try it
[46:11] by looking somebody out of that girl
[46:12] penical pentecostal well look you know
[46:15] your spirit's not too good don't go up
[46:17] yeah i got a headache
[46:22] no
[46:24] what about it
[46:27] i've heard god speak times
[46:30] that said a moment ago and sometimes
[46:32] it's sweet and sometimes it's not
[46:35] i've told you this and i've always told
[46:37] it because
[46:38] i tell it for his honor
[46:40] i was driving down the road one day and
[46:42] and a voice told me
[46:44] that when you pass that corner
[46:46] there'll be a beautiful woman standing
[46:49] there washing the car
[46:55] this is clear been better if you you
[46:56] know how to believe it quicker for the
[46:58] college been sitting in trouble around i
[46:59] said how do you know
[47:03] i turned around that corner looked over
[47:04] and i stood up
[47:06] a girl washing a car in a bikini
[47:10] i said satan get out of here
[47:14] he's oh no that was god talking to you
[47:16] brother dale
[47:18] no no because he would have told me some
[47:20] other things about that woman should
[47:21] have been him
[47:27] do you know the difference
[47:30] we've got the message to check what
[47:32] somebody's teaching
[47:34] right
[47:36] well brother so-and-so says it's this
[47:37] way
[47:40] that's those deceiving spirits
[47:44] well the prophet ordained him
[47:49] like a brother used to say it you know
[47:51] boy everybody used to run around wanting
[47:52] to know well i'm just mean enough and i
[47:54] got here
[47:55] faking enough i guess to ask but this
[47:57] brother used to go about the country
[47:58] preaching brother brown told me what to
[48:01] preach
[48:02] and i'm going to preach it
[48:05] well everybody what did you tell it
[48:07] brother well he told him a secret
[48:08] because at one time they believed he was
[48:10] one of the thunders do you remember that
[48:12] when they had the seven thunder messages
[48:14] they had seven men named off
[48:17] each one of them was to be a thunder and
[48:18] this was one of them
[48:20] well i happen to be sitting in his home
[48:22] a little bit with him and i just asked
[48:23] him what did brother branham tell him
[48:27] he said he told me to preach hell hot
[48:29] i said we're good
[48:36] everybody else thought it's some kind of
[48:38] mystery
[48:39] i found out what the mystery was he told
[48:41] me to preach hell is that hot
[48:43] but listen church
[48:45] you don't try a spirit by some form or
[48:48] your feelings or ideas
[48:51] mother brother around emphasize the two
[48:53] spirits
[48:55] in the framework of the church he said
[49:01] now let's don't go with it in a way you
[49:03] know
[49:04] see
[49:04] we could look at it like and say well
[49:06] well boy i tell you what i can really
[49:08] see that that antichrist down there in
[49:10] that pope because he's demanding them
[49:13] people worship him you know
[49:18] but
[49:19] that's easy to see
[49:21] forgot to be more deceiving than that
[49:25] remember my illustration a moment ago
[49:27] when god moves up satan moves up right
[49:31] god moves up satan moves up
[49:33] all right
[49:34] so when god come in the last days
[49:36] through the opening of the word satan
[49:38] comes right in there and he said
[49:40] attempted destruction of god's word we
[49:42] just read
[49:44] all right
[49:47] what about the people of this message
[49:49] destroying this message
[49:50] preachers i'm talking about i'm not
[49:51] talking about it you ain't never have
[49:53] trouble
[49:54] control the preachers
[49:58] and this is what it is men take a lot of
[50:00] time
[50:01] and people give you there's a man up
[50:03] north of yonder that believes we're
[50:04] going to get a
[50:06] another body
[50:08] to think this body redeemed and he'll
[50:10] quote brother branham more than i do
[50:14] but it's twisted
[50:17] you can do that
[50:19] how do you know what i'm telling you is
[50:20] the truth
[50:22] well brother that we have confidence in
[50:23] you
[50:25] a lot of people say they got confidence
[50:26] in the pope i'm sure they don't want to
[50:27] follow him
[50:29] do you have the holy spirit amen
[50:32] the only way
[50:34] i know ain't gonna get
[50:35] to it but the only way that you'll ever
[50:38] know anything about
[50:40] god in his ways is to have the holy
[50:43] spirit
[50:45] that's the qualification
[50:48] and then why would
[50:50] why would ministers in this message say
[50:51] you don't have the holy spirit
[50:55] you're just anointed with it or
[50:56] something
[51:00] destructing
[51:02] destructing you know destroying god's
[51:04] word
[51:05] right
[51:08] think about it
[51:11] the two spirits so we'll just stand on
[51:13] this part right here
[51:15] the two spirits
[51:18] so close together pull that back up
[51:19] brother joining
[51:21] finish reading it then we'll quit
[51:25] of the two spirits
[51:28] think about it so close
[51:32] until the bible said it would deceive
[51:34] the very elect
[51:36] if possible now here's whatever i
[51:38] thought oh but that can't be deceived
[51:40] now i know that quote
[51:42] but you won't dare quote this one
[51:44] brother brown said frankly
[51:47] it would get the true church so messed
[51:49] up he'd have to cut to work short now
[51:51] you want that quote
[51:55] oh i can't be deceived i got the holy
[51:57] ghost
[51:58] i spoke in tongues when i got it
[52:01] no no no we don't believe in that one
[52:02] well i believe the prophet
[52:05] what's the difference
[52:07] what's the difference in speaking in
[52:08] tongues or believing the prophet
[52:11] what's the difference in what's the
[52:12] point you want to make
[52:18] say i believe the prophet
[52:20] i believed the prophet for two years and
[52:21] while i was studying in this message for
[52:23] two years
[52:24] and i was a deacon at 23 years old so
[52:26] you know i must have been honored pretty
[52:28] well
[52:29] and i was teaching adult sunday school
[52:30] classes which was the deacons and elders
[52:32] when i left the baptist church at
[52:35] about 20
[52:37] 27 26
[52:42] but you see i when i seen what broke
[52:43] around was talking about the holy spirit
[52:45] i said immediately i don't have that
[52:47] holy spirit
[52:49] it wasn't my life because i didn't smoke
[52:52] i didn't drink i didn't run around i
[52:54] didn't do anything
[52:58] a lot of it was with self-control
[53:01] and i didn't do it
[53:03] but when i saw what he was talking about
[53:05] holy spirit
[53:06] and a person
[53:08] that would come and live in me
[53:10] i knew i'd talk to that person and i'd
[53:12] seen that person before because i told
[53:14] you about i seen him when i was 11 years
[53:16] old
[53:17] standing in a church
[53:19] but i never made that my experience of
[53:21] the new birth
[53:24] well you believe the message i've had
[53:25] preachers tell me that well so does the
[53:27] devil does that make him save
[53:31] will you such a great you can quote
[53:32] someone can my computer
[53:36] you certainly don't have it because it
[53:37] messes up on me i have to get these
[53:39] brothers out come on
[53:41] while they go richard and the chain went
[53:42] out and i didn't forgot to fix it where
[53:44] the the printer would work and i thought
[53:46] come on brother benny
[53:48] i got enough of them around here i just
[53:49] ought to come on one of you straighten
[53:51] this business out cause i can't do it
[53:56] and don't have the holy ghost
[53:58] the holy ghost is the only hope says as
[54:00] an individual person that you and i have
[54:05] to keep satan from destroying us look
[54:07] what he says
[54:10] if they get a true revelation of the two
[54:11] spirits within the framework of the
[54:13] christian church
[54:14] look and by god's spirit discern and
[54:17] withstand the antichrist spirit
[54:20] all right
[54:21] satan will be powerless before her
[54:25] he will be as
[54:26] definitely courted and said according to
[54:29] boarded today
[54:31] as when christ withstood his ever effort
[54:34] to gain power over him in the desert yes
[54:38] satan hates revelation but we love it
[54:40] with the true revelation in our lives
[54:43] the gates of hell cannot prevail against
[54:45] it but we will prevail over them
[54:49] get a revelation of the two spirits
[54:55] and they're definitely not out there
[54:56] they're in this message right here
[54:58] claiming the message and i'm not against
[54:59] anybody you know better name
[55:02] you have heard me know better than that
[55:04] you've been here with me
[55:05] i'm not against anybody
[55:08] no you can believe your big toe is god
[55:10] if you want to
[55:12] i'm honest
[55:13] because you don't believe something yeah
[55:15] well i believe it's the big toe
[55:19] but just don't ask me to kiss it
[55:22] i said only thing i'm saying
[55:24] don't ask me to believe
[55:26] i was in a meeting one time and this
[55:28] great man if i called his name everybody
[55:30] know him brother calling him sitting
[55:31] there and that brother said brother
[55:32] brown said so-and-so said now you raise
[55:34] your hand if you were different with me
[55:35] or want to know something too
[55:38] and they said all right brother dale i
[55:40] said brother didn't say that
[55:43] he said yes he did see that's where a
[55:45] lot of people rejected yes he did i said
[55:47] no he didn't
[55:50] i said here's what he said
[55:55] this other brother there was a
[55:56] well-known brother in the message
[55:59] he called that man's name he said
[56:00] brother dale is right right around him
[56:01] didn't say that
[56:05] well i'll say it i said continue on
[56:09] you say what you want to
[56:11] just don't say right around said it in
[56:13] front of these people here that don't
[56:14] know he didn't say it when i went to the
[56:16] philippines i cried
[56:18] the two soul doctrines and the things i
[56:20] hadn't filtered through the philippines
[56:24] see they didn't have any quotes in the
[56:25] message to defend it
[56:28] they were at the mercy of the best that
[56:30] they could do because they were trying
[56:31] to believe brother brown was a prophet
[56:34] people go away it's like that man said
[56:35] brother said so and so what is his big
[56:37] name
[56:39] and i one time i did cry because
[56:42] this brother said you know what to do
[56:44] said here we talk about peter paul james
[56:47] and john
[56:48] he said when you go to the foreign
[56:49] fields and and all like that he said
[56:51] they talk about
[56:53] you know
[56:54] big names in this message
[57:01] not cry
[57:04] if that's all those people in you
[57:09] they were at the mercy of those people
[57:13] but everyone said i'll be glad when the
[57:14] church gets to the place if they stand
[57:16] up and say
[57:17] paul didn't say that
[57:22] if i don't say it the way the prophet
[57:24] i'm talking about not quote verbatim to
[57:25] work you know that every word has got to
[57:27] be perfect i'm talking about if i don't
[57:29] stay with what he said come and talk
[57:31] show me
[57:35] i may not agree with you
[57:37] i may not turn down you know and just
[57:39] fall down and i've been hit like that
[57:41] with people telling me things and i
[57:43] don't just fall over dead because i
[57:45] don't believe it
[57:46] but the lord ever reveals to me i'll do
[57:48] it but you know what i'll do i'll come
[57:49] right back out here to the next service
[57:51] and i'll call your name and say you come
[57:52] to my office and showed me where i was
[57:54] wrong now if you want to believe what
[57:56] he's saying her saying who's saying or
[57:58] what's to say
[57:59] you go right ahead this is what i'm
[58:00] going to say
[58:01] until the lord tells me differently
[58:04] then when he tells me i'll be glad to
[58:06] tell
[58:08] because i'm not the final authority
[58:13] the lord jesus christ is
[58:16] but think on these signs
[58:19] the book of revelation come on music
[58:22] the book of revelations
[58:26] is your book
[58:28] your name you want to know your name
[58:31] read it
[58:32] and to the church of lady of sin i'm not
[58:35] a lady of siam
[58:40] well where are you at
[58:43] where's the age you're in
[58:46] lady of sin was a license
[58:48] there's not another church agent where
[58:50] are you at
[58:52] right

[59:01] the book of revelations is my book
[59:05] my name is in the book
[59:08] brother branham what did he say
[59:10] he said now armand devils not written in
[59:13] the book
[59:14] right
[59:16] he said well what is to take place in
[59:18] the day that arma devil is upon the
[59:21] earth
[59:22] is written in the book
[59:24] you know what that puts his name in it
[59:28] what about
[59:30] let's stand together think on these
[59:32] things
[59:35] the book of revelations can be
[59:37] understood satan don't want you to
[59:38] understand it because it shows his
[59:41] origin and it shows his destruction
[59:44] it shows what he's trying to do
[59:47] he's trying his best to twist this
[59:49] message to get people
[59:51] to worry that they don't believe it
[59:53] i rejoice the other day most of you know
[59:55] about it i wouldn't know i don't know if
[59:57] it probably does work
[59:59] brother attacked up in jeffersonville

[1:00:02] media and you know everything
[1:00:04] i thank god that the two men that they
[1:00:06] got a hold of

[1:00:14] weber college
[1:00:16] sitting there he said this message is

[1:00:20] about jesus christ

[1:00:30] these kooks what would it be
