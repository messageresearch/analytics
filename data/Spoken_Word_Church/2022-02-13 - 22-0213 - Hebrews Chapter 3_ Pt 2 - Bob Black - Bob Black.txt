TRANSCRIPT
========================================
god bless you saints yeah like you said monica's doing wonderful so i appreciate your prayers and your and your calls and all of those things we sure appreciate we sure appreciate having to pray in church so last time we were we were looking at hebrews chapter three and uh got down to about verse five let's just go to the lord in prayer real quick before we go into the word lord thank you thank you so thankful lord to be able to come together this morning to look into your word and i pray god so just strengthen us now lord edify us by the things that we read lord and give us give us courage to fight this battle lord and we pray lord that you'll be with brother wade as he prepares lord for the morning message in the name of the lord jesus now um so so hebrews chapter 3 verse 5 says and moses verily was faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after but christ as the son over his own house whose house are we if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end so paul is talking about building a house and christ is the one that's that's that's building a tabernacle for himself to live in and that's what he talks about in first corinthians for we are laborers together with god ye are god's husbandry ye are god's building according to the grace of god which has given them to me as a wise master builder i have laid the foundation and another build of their own but let every man take heed how he build with their opponent now you think about all these kind of hard to be understood things that paul lays out that he's he's actually laying out all the materials and laying out all the frameworks so that this house this tabernacle can be built down through seven church ages everything that we preach this goes back to what the things that paul told us about and because god's god's trying to build a building that that so that he can tabernacle in now but now paul gets into here he's he begins to warn us he begins and the major theme of the next the rest of the chapters is watch out that you don't do like the children of israel when they were coming out of egypt because they failed to believe everything that the prophet that that their prophet moses told them they failed to believe the promise that god had promised that they were going to be able to go into the promised land and and reap the rewards so if we go to the next slide hebrews uh chapter 3 verse 8 says harden not your hearts as in the provocation and the day of temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my works 40 years now you you really when you begin to meditate on the things in this chapter it's very it's very scolding it's it's it's kind of harsh the things to to consider are you know you begin to consider uh are are we are we failing like like like they failed and so paul says wherefore i was grieved with that generation and he's quoting and said they do always air in their heart and they have not known my way so i swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest now what provocation means provocation is when you it's something you do to make somebody real annoyed or angry so that children of israel they were annoying they were getting making god upset you think about all the things that god did for them showed them a pillar of fire part of the red sea and gave them water from a rock and manner from heaven and all the different things and yet they failed to believe when they came to going over into the promised land they failed they stopped and failed to believe that god was able to give them what what is the promise the promise is the baptism of the holy ghost now if we go to the next slide brother evan said they heard it they heard it but they didn't believe it god come down he showed them a pillar of fire showed by his prophet signs and wonders he was with him they didn't believe it oh they like to see the miracles they like to hear the prophet so you you go to a church service and and they and they start saying well god sent a prophet and everybody rejoices they believe they believe as far as believing it but he said but as far as believing that they didn't their lives prove they didn't now he said don't you fall after that same example of unbelief or in this last days to the gentile church god has appeared again same sign same warner same pillar of fire vindicated proven let us not harden our hearts and fall in that temptation back yonder of unbelief full will rot on earth and that'll be all of it now if we go to the next slide he said let's stop here a minute the provocation when they provoked now what did god do now paul is trying to speak let's go down to the next highlighted verse paragraph 121. he said no god had his people with unsettled rest they were down in egypt they were out of their right position they were out of their homeland what was our homeland the promise of the baptism in the holy ghost now now that that that means different something different depending on where you are in your journey and i'm gonna get into that they were strangers and pilgrims and god was going to bring them from that housed in place in egypt up to the homeland a title today we're unsettled here it don't take long little chubby handed boys playing marbles little girls with the dollies playing the first thing you know you got gray hair and wrinkled up there's something wrong here now now he's see he's talking about he's talking about a born-again christian that there's something wrong but we're going somewhere we're going somewhere what are we going to we're going to adoption we're going to a body change so we're in a journey he said there's something wrong here this is not home we're in the wrong place that's why we say we are pilgrims and strangers something's happened we gotta we gotta get somewhere so don't do like them in the provocation to disbelieve now now we gotta to to really this really to sink home we've got to understand where we are you remember and when you young people you go to the mall back in the day when people still went to malls and malls were open they'd have a big kiosk at the front that said you are here in the mall or if you maybe you go to a theme park and you look at the map and it says you are here so you can know where you are so this this this story maybe won't make as much sense to you if you don't understand where you are today in this story now and so let's go to the next slide now think about this now meditate on this where where are you in this story you're in you're in this somewhere now the children of israel coming out of egypt they were coming out of egypt and they went through the wilderness and they were going to the promised land and now now you now we can compare that with justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost so you're you're going through this place of sanctification on the way to a promise that god has given to you so you're in the middle of this journey and all these things are happening there's so much so much happens in that state of sanctification because that's where you're packing the word in and you're you're trying to keep the candlesticks lit and you're you're at that altar of incense praying and things happen and you've got to repent and you're trying to trying to trying to live a christian life and things are but you're on your way to the promised land now where we can kind of get mixed up is when you think well i'm already born again so that doesn't apply to me anymore and there's where you miss the picture you missed the big picture of of where you are in that story if you're sitting here this morning and you think sanctification no longer applies to you anymore anymore then you're let's let's get into the depth of the message what the message really is let's go beyond now now you're born again we got to go somewhere now let's if we go to the next slide let's kind of look at the at the road map god gave us a road map in the old testament that we can look at and you get you got in on the outside the outer court your sacrifice has been offered and you put your hands on the bloody sacrifice and to identify yourself with it and you're washed and baptized at the labor and then you're as as part of your to show justification that christ died for your sins and that you go on into into sanctification where you got the three the three the the table of showbread you where you open up your bible and you're studying and you and you've got the candlesticks where you're you're trying to keep them lit and they go out and it gets foggy in there and you're trying to keep them lit and everything but then finally you go into the baptism of the holy ghost where the word begins to open up to you and the life of christ begins to live in you and now that now the word is beginning to be real to you he gives you his faith but that's not that's not the end of the story so now now now let's get a little bit deep here because you got to understand where you are for this story to make sense the story of the provocation in the wilderness because if you think that that sanctification doesn't apply to you anymore then you won't be able to understand this story correctly so let's say you you're you you you go you've gone uh you've gone through this journey justification sanctification baptism all the ghosts now you're inside i gotta stay close to the microphone you're in inside the holy of holies but now now what you gotta do something happen that's personal to you but now what happens is you come out to share with their other people now you're you've got a life that's got to be put on display now you go to church and you can show so it's like you're coming out you're coming out to share with others what happened to you on the inside there so then now after that that that your journey started now you're going through like phase two now let's look at that on the on the next slide so you go through justification sanctification and baptism in the holy ghost and now you're going back you're on a journey just like the children of israel again you're going back through a higher level of sanctification where every day every day things need to be cleansed out of your life and and and and it's the baptism of the holy ghost it's the holy ghost that's doing it in your life it's cleaning you out as these virtues are added to you to make you live and walk like christ and when where are you going to what are you going you're going to a place of adoption where god can can actually begin to open up the seals to you and get you to a place where he can open things up the way that he wants to now why what happened at baby form justification he's trying to get you to a place where he can he can put his own life in you and now once he's done that he wants to get you to a place where he can open up the word the way that he really wanted to he wants to and that that comes at adoption he wants to he wants to get you to a place where you can understand christ the mystery of god revealed and and who is this melchizedek and what the seven seals are and be able to look back and understand the path that god that journey that god has taken you on and then once it gets to to get you to an adoption then he wants to get you to a place where he can he he can open these things up to you you think about you think about jesus christ there at on when he went up to mount transfiguration and and a voice from heaven said hear ye him but then then you find out christ was there in the garden of gethsemane crying out to god let this cup pass for me so there's still even after you come to adoption there's something something else that has to take place a dying out to the flesh of dying out so that you think about christ there in the garden of gethsemane what if he had said you know what i'd rather i would rather just go take a wife and just live my life out and not die on the cross then he could have done that but yet he would have never come to that place where he rose on easter morning and his body was changed there's got to there's got to see after even after you come to adoption you there's another you continue through that process right you see why brother brown he he he would preach through the all these sermons about this pattern of the justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost and it goes beyond just just being just being born again and you see that's why you've got to understand what happened in the as they were coming out of out of egypt through this wilderness journey it's it's more than just just being born again and so now now brother branham in the in the intervale in 1956 he said that that in this place where you dwell on the inside the secret place with god there's a difference in their look he said there was three lives that led man there was three lives that lead man today the first thing there was three stages of the manner three state what are we talking about three stages there's three stages of everything there was three stages of everything there's three stages of your experience now look you can see that in all through the scripture you can see elisha had three stages of his experience when he followed elijah david had three stages of his experience he was he was anointed by samuel then he was anointed by the tribe of judah then he was anointed by all of israel to be king they all had three stages and you got three stages of your experience everybody in the all these types and shadows show in three stages now now let's take this let's take this just maybe so you can see take what that slide we just we just saw and let's rotate it so now you can see the ladder that you're climbing up let's spin it on its side and see what that looks like let's go to the next slide so you go through justification sanctification you're in that wilderness you're on a journey so so what what's my point my point is this story will mean something different to you based on where you are in your journey so if you're if you're not born again you're on that bottom rung you're in a place where you're going to church but you're not born again here and you're you're you're looking for that promise of the holy ghost that god can put his life in you and make the word begin he can begin to do the believing and do the living you're you're you're on that way to the journey and if you fail to believe the ministers and if you fail to believe the word you'll never make it to that to that bowling experience but now what if you're born again now what if you're born again now you're going through the wilderness again and you're on your way where you're on your way to adoption you're on your climbing up and if you fail to believe what the prophet said if you start grumbling and complaining with the ministers and how hard it gets to be a christian sometimes and you begin to murmur at what god has given to you and murmur at how hard sometimes it is to understand the word like you know maybe baby they did back there when when paul would say things hard to be understood murmur and complain how are you going to get to adoption then once you've got to adoption once you got to adoption how are you going to get to a body change except you believe the word that's been preached so you're depending on where you are in your journey that story will mean something different to you that's why that's why even when you come to church everybody hears something different depending on where you are you different people will pick on different things pick up on different things that are said and you can actually here understand where somebody else is in their journey by what they'll echo back sometimes i i heard what you were preaching or or different you know they'll people pick up on something different based on where they are in their journey now now if we go to the next slide brother adam said an adoption he said there was three stages of the journey and there's three stages of this journey we are justified by faith believing on the lord jesus christ forsaken the land of egypt come out and then are sanctified through the offering of his blood washed from our sins and become pilgrims and sojourners claiming that we are seeking a land a city that's coming or a promise i hope this maybe means something different to you now that he's not just talking about just being born again he's talking about you're on the journey so did israel in the wilderness sojourners no place place to rest traveling night after night following the pillar of fire but finally come to the promised land where they settled down now what's the promised land for you the promised land is a new birth or the promised land is adoption the token the true baptism of the holy ghost or the promised land is a body change so it depends on where you are in your journey now no place to rest now if we go to the next slide let's think about think about coming to that place of sanctification and all that work you've got to do in there in that holy place constantly tending to the candlestick constantly at that table of that table of showbread opening up the word and and studying and eating and eating and going to the altar of incense and saying god forgive me for what i've done because you're working toward that you're not you working let's restate it's the holy ghost and you work bringing you to a place of rest in the in the in the holy of holies that's why he said no place to rest traveling night after night like the children of israel in the wilderness traveling following the pillar of fire but finally come to the promised land where they settle down so in that wilderness in that wilderness journey there's a lot of provocations a lot of things there was a lot of profit a lot of things that they did to provoke god and a lot of things today that we can do to provoke god just like they did so let's look at some of them provocations then doubting god was with him you think about them with a pillar of fire with them knowing that god was leading them that god was with that man and yet they doubted that god was with him how could we could we be guilty of the same thing today you know what brother wade's back there studying the message when he comes out do we doubt that guess god's speaking to us that do we doubt that that that the man of god is speaking as of the oracles of god do we do we disbelieve god's servant just as they did back then are we dissatisfied with the man and we begin to think that it's boring just like they did and wish for something a little bit wish for something a little bit more exhilarating something maybe so that we could be entertained some a little bit more you know you wonder sometimes if maybe it would maybe church would go better if the preacher would come out juggling and riding a unicycle or something because we we don't get entertained by the word as much we the the word if we if we really see the word as as our life then it becomes it we don't look at our circumstance and things so much like like back then he said look at looking at circumstance instead of the promise and looking back to egypt looking back to where they had been delivered from you know as cr if you're a real christian if you're a really really see where you're headed to then you you stop looking at all that all that the muck in the mire from where you come from and and uh all the makeup and and bad clothes and all that stuff it it loses its appeal and see that's where they begin to doubt they begin to doubt god's word they begin to look back and and wish that they were still back in egypt to even to a place where they were like i wish i wish that we would have died in egypt now you think you think about somebody that would make a statement like that and then look around you in this day and you can see people doing the exact same thing leaving the message and going back to egypt going back to the because you can't leave the message and retain your standard of holiness you can't leave the message and continue to be holiness doubting what god was able to honor his word or saying i know a better way of doing it now you think you think what you think about god what god gives us is revelation revelation the revelation of his word that's what we're after and see when you see a man come out from behind the pulpit and and and and give something that's a deep a show a deep understanding a deep understanding of the word that shows that he's got an understanding of life he's got an understanding of supernatural life and then when you say within your heart well i think i know a better way of doing it jesus said i am the way the truth and the life so if you know jesus you know the way and there's no way a better way to do anything than jesus christ you see how they begin to doubt they begin to want they begin to think that i know better a better way to do things than moses i've got a better way of doing it i've got a better way and people begin to you know but subvert in the church and think i i've got a better way of i i know a better way to do different things in the church than brother wade does or whatever i'm just being i'mma be plain be playing brother bob provocations today doubting god is with us or doubting the prophet in the ministry doubting being dissatisfied with the word or keeping one foot in the world or thinking you know better way or doubting it is possible for god how about this doubting that it's possible for god to to reveal the word to you doubting that it's possible for the seals to be open you know many times we'll come into church and we'll get so cabbage down and we think well i just don't know if it's possible because the word seems difficult but if you'll just keep pressing on press on the word god will open up i i i you know just just to get a little bit personal i've studied many nights until i just come to a point of exhaustion because i want i don't want to get up here and just say say uh empty words but i want to know what i'm talking about when you come to a place where you you you you press you get desperate something will happen god is able to reveal his word god is able to open up the word to you today so what will they do when they were wondering in the wilderness if we go to the next slide in the wilderness of sin for 40 years that's what that will the wilderness of sin wilderness of unbelief because the unbelief now you think when they came out of egypt they really only had a really short journey to the promised land and the point i'm trying to make is it shouldn't take you long to get born again you think sometimes it should take me a really long time to give being born again is really easy god wants to give it to you more than you want to give it to yourself and also he wants to adopt you now now the thing the reason they wandered around in the wilderness was because of their unbelief but if you'll bulk it down and get serious with god it won't take you long to come to a place where god can use you it won't take you and you see the same thing it won't take you long it won't take the church long to take a body change if we'll really get serious with god and buckle down and and get in the word and find out what god wants us to understand the reason why they wandered and wandered and wandered and wandered for 40 years instead of making a quick little trip to the promised land was because of their unbelief now brother brahm said a little something can raise up instead of going to write to the scripture and find out whether it's true or not oh you say oh no that's what he said no see there you go ahead i'll just continue a presbyterian like i am see go ahead blind and you provoke god when god does anything he expects the nation to grab it but instead of that you know well i don't know about that is that how we do sometimes when maybe a little bit hard preaching this preach we go we go to sleep because we don't want it we we don't come to church because we don't want it and that's our unbelief working our unbelief is on display when it when we don't grab it grab it you got to take the kingdom by force you got to come to church with a desire to get your blessing and the musicians can go ahead and come forward see he expects the people to get it if you're concerned enough sit down with the scripture if you're concerned enough you'll get as close to the front as you can if you're concerned enough you'll pray and seek god you'll use your idle time to get close to god if you're concerned enough and we'll in on that god bless you [Applause] you
