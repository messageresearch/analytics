========================================

pretty much different variations of all the same name right so I said hm something significant here I didn't know what I texted it out to several people Brooke texted me back said that name means pure p u r e and I thought hm that's neat sounds pretty two days later it finally struck me what that means look up pure it means untainted it means free from disease free from Ill see God he works through nurses he works through doctors he works through medicine but God is the Healer God was beginning to purify our baby from the severe lung disease beginning to draw it out of her because that was her diagnosis by this time was severe lung disease he was cleansing her and why four because three is a witness three would have got our attention but there were four of them don't get ahead of me now he's already got me figured out I'm sure four is God's number of Deliverance in the Bible there the children of Israel were 400 years in the land of Egypt in bondage when they were delivered that's right Lazarus was 4 days in the grave when Jesus resurrected him and delivered him from Death right on and the children of Israel I'm sorry let's see the Hebrew children there you go he mentioned it this morning the three Hebrew children in the fiery furnace uh and the fourth man seen in that fire was their deliverer okay four is guys's number of Deliverance through four nurses whose name means pure which is a four-letter word God was beginning to purify her baby and cleanse her from the sickness and watch this she was born she was delivered from the womb if you will at four minutes till midnight and by the way a side note that was the best delivery best that gab's done so far everything went so smoothly I believe the other midwives were anointed but this time more than ever because I stand there praying you know I have to believe it and four minutes till midnight is when she was born she went into the NICU just a couple hours later and all day Saturday all day Sunday or excuse me all day uh Thursday Friday and Saturday she got worse worse and worse and Saturday night she was at the point of death but on the fourth day which was Sunday the Resurrection Day the day we honor and celebrate the resurrection God began to raise her and heal her from that sickness and I'm not done she's our fourth child and you know God delivered me from Fear on our fourth child Lord and she has a four-letter name IA her middle name is a four-letter name Jun now watch this what was the next thing I didn't write any of this down I just practiced it a lot four and four okay and uh my forgot it it'll come to me four and four all the four is in her name now watch she is her name means uh God is gracious did I say that at the start of it I don't remember God is gracious is what ia's name means it's a Hebrew name God is gracious and all through this trial God was gracious not only to deliver me but gracious to deliver her from the sickness God's grace was manifested over and over and over amen and um and there was just so many other things just one thing after another I'm trying to jog my memory because there was four I know there was another four in there uh but God was gracious and let it be said of IA from this day forward whenever you think of IA remember that God is gracious to to deliver God's grace is sufficient to deliver okay and um if I remember that other thing I'll just have to come back up and say it later oh yeah here it is oh it's a big one hang on it's a big one see anytime God gives you something The Devil Makes You doubt it so immediately after this the devil's making me doubt and I said okay big boy we'll see you come the next trial we'll find out if I got delivered from fear or not the next trial came a couple weeks later it was last Sunday morning brother Quinn was preaching Ula laid there on her back asleep and Gabby and the girls were in the bathroom and and uh the devil thought H this pretty good opportunity to sneak in and cause some Mischief cause some trouble I was holding IA my hands were tied okay and YULA was laying there on her back asleep and her arms began to flail like this about once every second with the heartbeat you know and she was asleep now I thought maybe it's just a nightmare but it'll just go away but no she kept doing it and then I noticed she's not breathing so I went up to raise her up she was just as limp as could be not breathing she opened her eyes and her her eyelids okay and her eyes were rolled back in her head she was having a FAL seizure her seizure had spiked it was up to 103.5 and she was not breathing now I just all I did I handed off the baby to Terrence and and took Ula picked her up and carried her out and said Lord bless my baby and no sooner than I did that that she coughed all that out and she began to breathe and it was in just within moments the brother Aaron a whole host of other people and our two of our church staff nurses were out there assessing her people are surrounding us with prayer and and praise and it wasn't too long after that she came out of that and she's perfectly normal and well right now but here's the thing I didn't fear I just simply went and picked her up and acted I just prayed and carried her out and said Lord if you take my baby she's yours the lord giveth and Lord blesses the way the lord giveth and lord taketh way bless the name of the Lord no worry I just walked out and just believed God delivered me from fearl now uh the sisters if you will come there's one last thing I want to do uh the sisters are going to sing the song I need sister Esther and brother Richard Roberts no other musicians I want yall to be able to see the uh slideshow they're going to sing a special song all the sisters that are singing please this is a

Worker amen let's stand together we're going to have a baby dedication so you want to go ahead and bring up the the little one and we always do here come up with the parents the grandparents the great grandparents a whole family and uncles there's any ants come on with it bring the whole family she's want she's Wan you back around let's this thing bring them in while they're getting everything ready okay bring them in bring them in bring the little ones to [Music] Jesus bring down in bring them in bring the little ones to J right bring them in bring them bring the little ones to Jesus bring them in bring them in bring a little to Jesus amen and amen and amen that's what we do we bring the little ones to Jesus you know a lot of churches they do different things but remember in the scripture they brought the little children that's right to Jesus and he blessed them yep right it's not a thing that we call it a baptism or anything it's just a basis that we bring them to the Lord we hand them into the hands of the Lord and ask the Lord to take care of them that's right right he's been gracious to have done all so far so we know he'll finish the day but how do we also do we also do one thing the family standing see when we come to a baby dedication it's a little bit different I guess and most people and like I said it's not an infant doing things it's not a saying they're saved or anything it's just we've come to dedicate them to the Lord give them into the hands of the Lord and then you know what they would take them to Jesus he'd bless them he'd give them right back to them cuz you know who raised the children Jesus didn't raise the children it was the people the ones around that raised and we always say even to the church that everybody in this church today is a a people that are dedicated to one thing for you to live a life that this child would have an opportunity to be able to see Jesus Christ that's the point of all of it the whole thing is the dedicating right but the dedicating of the people that are a witness to all of it that's right that now we're to live before this child to where the child could have an opportunity of seeing Jesus Christ that's all we try to do and that's what we try to bring them to the to the Lord turn around see her she snooze you just scream see father we bring little IA June to you Lord the family brought her they want her to dedicated to you it's not me standing here in the bases of anything is just what we're planning do if you was here you would take the child and you hold it up and you just bless it then you give it back to the family for them to live guide and take care of it to raise the child for your honor and Glory we thank you Father that we've had this opportunity to be a part part of this today be a part of seeing the family standing here that they realize that a miracle yes has transpired yes in all of their lives that they can see that you brought a baby where that even the doctor said it couldn't live yet you brought it to the places that now it's in your hands now we just commit little to you Lord we believe you we thank you in Jesus name now Lord we give her back to the family for them to raise we love you and we thank you little bundle a little bundle of joy that's right think of all of the the little ones and we've dedicated all of these little ones each ones had their opportunity to be dedicated amen
