[0:00] but what made a joke Blackfoot that were
[0:02] never guilty I mean barefoot this
[0:04] barefoot railroad over there there's
[0:06] somebody lives in he said the sounds
[0:08] they'll preach up that broken what
[0:15] broken yeah that's right seven thunders
[0:27] I can't remember the guys name and he's
[0:35] an older gentleman but he know he's not
[0:39] a it's not somebody that's real familiar
[0:42] so didn't have going there but another
[0:52] revolution
[0:55] [Music]
[1:07] [Applause]
[1:09] party out there is break the wind come
[1:18] back she should know I was in the car
[1:20] for 12 hours for the kids all right
[1:33] let's get started
[1:34] hearing back in the book of Romans no we
[1:36] were talking about last Sunday we were
[1:39] talking about circumcision versus
[1:41] uncircumcision and we know that it's the
[1:43] circumcision in the heart not the
[1:45] circumcision of the flesh but now
[1:47] watching because Paul has to come back
[1:49] because you can't take you can't take
[1:54] natural circumcision in a way because
[1:56] it's in the Bible right because that's
[1:59] what they depended on in the Old
[2:00] Testament they depended on that
[2:02] circumcision because that's what God
[2:04] said likes an Abraham for a sign going
[2:06] circumcise yourself and your household
[2:09] and everyone after this as a sign that I
[2:12] have accepted your faith guess what
[2:14] right here says with what advantage then
[2:17] have the Jew or what profit is there of
[2:19] circumcision
[2:20] nay that's in question much every way
[2:27] chiefly because that unto them were
[2:29] committed the Oracles of God Paul
[2:31] couldn't deny that God came to Israel
[2:34] first gave them a covenant gave them
[2:36] something to live by until he would come
[2:40] so you can't do away like the old text
[2:43] to me you can't do away with the Old
[2:44] Testament so the Old Testament that
[2:46] circumcision but let's keep reading
[2:50] because Paul's gonna bring it right back
[2:51] in and say well we know before that it
[2:54] was all certainty you were circumcised
[2:56] you were do if you were in the border of
[3:00] Israel or the house of God now it's the
[3:04] circumcision of the heart or the inward
[3:07] man all right watch much every way
[3:09] chiefly because that unto them were
[3:11] committed the Oracles of God all again
[3:13] not denying that God came to his request
[3:16] we came to know that God came to him
[3:18] from first and gave them something to
[3:20] live by okay for what if some did not
[3:25] believe in other words once Paul say
[3:30] there were many people that were
[3:32] physically circumcised they didn't live
[3:36] they did live the law that did work even
[3:38] really even in the Jewish ground they
[3:41] were murderers and Liars and you know
[3:43] one thing so what's he saying him for
[3:45] what if some did not believe he's
[3:47] actually doing question he said now
[3:48] shall Berlin believe made the faith of
[3:52] God without effect because the faith of
[3:54] God was that Abraham said I'm gonna have
[3:56] a child
[3:57] and God said see little circumcision and
[4:01] that would be a sign unto you that you
[4:03] believe me but not everybody bleed just
[4:06] like now but you can't have a
[4:09] circumcision of the heart of now
[4:11] definitely Jesus know you can search me
[4:13] to the heart now and be a believer now
[4:15] there's some things you can't understand
[4:17] there is something that you don't
[4:18] believe back to a point but you've got
[4:22] to come to something because their heart
[4:24] is a believer I was telling them this
[4:25] morning in the inn
[4:28] brother that I told them I said how many
[4:30] of you seen Jesus jesus said if you've
[4:33] seen me you've seen the father
[4:35] I said what did they say they stopped or
[4:39] or what was Philip do and Philip said
[4:42] you're talking about this father to
[4:45] Jesus in John 14 you're talking to me
[4:48] about that father you're telling us
[4:50] father did this and father did that and
[4:52] the father does this and I'd work this
[4:54] in the father where's the father Philip
[4:59] said I mean Jesus said Philip
[5:01] come on having been so long with you if
[5:04] you've seen me you've seen the father so
[5:07] when I told them inside the class I
[5:08] think you never seen do you want no
[5:11] fellow cannot say that Philip saw Jesus
[5:13] that and then but we didn't know Jesus
[5:15] dark rum so we have to be believers
[5:16] that's why you know I told her we were
[5:18] sitting there and under the under the
[5:20] umbrella of being a believer we believe
[5:22] that Jesus Christ died on the cross for
[5:23] our sins and that the heavenly father
[5:27] was any I didn't get into the Trinity
[5:31] but the heavenly father was any doing
[5:33] the work so that's what Jesus said well
[5:36] they kind of looked at me a little
[5:37] struggle when I said look if Jesus said
[5:39] if you've seen me you've seen the father
[5:41] I said now he's lying if that's not what
[5:45] happened yeah so whatever Jesus did is
[5:50] what the father did just like me it's
[5:52] like I was talking about us
[5:53] with a DNA marker a genetic marker I
[5:56] won't let my grandpa let say the father
[5:58] you won't like think Lord Donnie public
[6:02] you know time walk down the aisles for
[6:04] 20-something years I mean that and Duty
[6:09] comes and now you watch you go watch
[6:12] Donnie Donnie is the same I mean you can
[6:16] just take the top part of 90 off and you
[6:18] wear it was Tom why because there's a
[6:20] genetic marker inside Donnie that came
[6:24] from daddy that he can't get away from
[6:27] you can't get away from that so the same
[6:30] thing with the Heavenly Father that's
[6:31] what I said if you become a Christian
[6:32] that's what led to my story
[6:34] about if you were put on trial could
[6:38] they convict you being Christian I said
[6:39] Jesus said I went home to John 14 20 and
[6:44] said I and you and you and me and I said
[6:46] it's not to Jesus and I told him I said
[6:47] why don't we pray looking up what's the
[6:49] did Moses said he ain't him up there
[6:52] Jesus says he's not a very rich and I'm
[6:55] gonna come back and be with you in you
[6:57] have to meet right here Noddy
[6:58] you know so that's what I said I said
[7:00] now can you commit to being a Christian
[7:02] so same here but but circumcision didn't
[7:07] you know what we can all go say well
[7:10] we've been circumcised they probably a
[7:13] hundred percent of people know there's
[7:16] probably 90 percent of people that's
[7:18] been circumcised angle maybe the help
[7:21] physically physically and them too
[7:25] because it says in other words what's
[7:27] he's saying the same way I'm with you
[7:29] now but it doesn't believe makes the
[7:33] faith of God but effective when you say
[7:36] don't believe that just put there stop
[7:37] the whole process
[7:39] god forbid yeah you let God be true but
[7:43] every man a liar in other words I can be
[7:46] circumcised and it really just like I
[7:49] told y'all last Sunday you have nothing
[7:53] to do with certainty your Enzo please
[7:57] the clay you understand what I'm saying
[8:00] physically you didn't have a choice
[8:01] and a male complete an Internet you know
[8:06] they do better than that and your
[8:07] parents did it right it was the parents
[8:10] they put it to it what does you know so
[8:15] come in
[8:21] yes and you look in different cultures
[8:25] and they don't so throw it away it's
[8:28] just not like I said and that's what
[8:30] he's saying god forbid you can't make
[8:32] this a book God a believer there's only
[8:34] certain like you know you and and really
[8:37] that's what Paul was saying about
[8:39] whoever was Timothy when you think
[8:41] within a temple come on play with your
[8:45] flesh but they're like incoming in area
[8:49] to file in the temple you know he
[8:51] circles out well you know what they must
[8:54] have checked him out how they do it but
[8:58] pulse it Oh God that's what he's saying
[9:01] here come on are we gonna make it a
[9:03] belief that we have to be circumcised no
[9:06] God forbid forget about you can be an
[9:08] unbeliever and be circumcised but you
[9:12] can't be an unbeliever be circumcised in
[9:14] the heart when you should get a
[9:16] circumcision in the heart that favor
[9:18] tonight cuts off that hole thanks this
[9:21] flesh and gets rid of that let God be
[9:25] true but every man a liar
[9:26] as it is written that thou mightest be
[9:29] justified in thy Saints and - overcome
[9:32] when thou art judged but if our
[9:38] unrighteousness commend the
[9:40] righteousness of God why shall we say is
[9:42] gone and righteous should take this
[9:44] vengeance I speak to the man they
[9:45] inflated god forbid but then how shall
[9:48] God judge the world in other words he's
[9:50] going to knock there to judge the world
[9:52] my circumcision like I said if you flesh
[10:00] even at the day of judgment the people
[10:03] are going to walk up in the flesh they
[10:05] send in but that flesh is not what
[10:07] there's what's gonna send them to hell
[10:10] it's being unbelievable what's going to
[10:13] send you to
[10:14] the other place the for if the truth of
[10:17] God hath more abounded through my life
[10:20] and into his glory why yet and I also
[10:23] judge as a center somebody must have
[10:25] brought something up against Paulo and
[10:29] not rather these different waiting as we
[10:31] be slanderously reported now some has
[10:33] must have said fall of something else
[10:36] Paulo you're a sinner you're doing there
[10:38] she doing it and you know what happens
[10:41] you look at Paul's life we may look at
[10:45] Jesus's life they say he was a sinner
[10:48] they say he was born of fornication a
[10:51] lot I've ever loved to hang around
[10:53] prostitute from sin and they call it a
[10:56] meals both anyone Almighty God so same
[11:00] way of a Paul Paul you can't be of God
[11:02] let's don't get before you though they
[11:04] keep you out they try to kill you
[11:06] they've done legions looking for you
[11:08] probably you can be of God alright
[11:11] he said I think hey talk about that he
[11:16] said look why don't we saying that much
[11:17] do evil that good may come whose
[11:19] damnation is just let us do evil then
[11:21] what's he saying he's saying I'm gonna
[11:24] do something bad intentionally so that I
[11:29] get something good out of it no that's
[11:30] not you know that was I do that's not a
[11:33] right you don't want to do something
[11:35] well out a great couple of beers and see
[11:37] what God's gonna do you know I know
[11:39] you're tempting God and that's what he's
[11:40] fixing to say you're tempting God and
[11:42] don't tempt i what then are we better
[11:47] than they knowing no eyes no look for we
[11:51] have before proved both Jews that they
[11:55] are all under sin so call disprove the
[11:58] big blanket up dancing we're all up
[12:00] whether they you circumcised whether you
[12:03] go to the temple with you is this
[12:05] they'll marry whatever okay or at all
[12:09] understand that's why I like to start at
[12:11] that point and there was a guy walked up
[12:14] to me afterwards because I told him
[12:16] about
[12:18] in my 20th anniversary was in June of
[12:27] 1998 one of your school graduation
[12:32] anniversary well I was part of them of
[12:35] the officers so we got all hit with any
[12:40] way you look at everything together and
[12:42] only the four file that was around me
[12:43] knew who I was
[12:44] and the other one saw men they voted me
[12:47] the most changed person will see I had a
[12:49] conversion the Christian conversion back
[12:51] in December of that year from December
[12:53] to Jim they declared that I was a
[12:55] different person than the guy walking a
[12:56] minute this morning they said yeah I'm
[13:00] stood I couldn't remember when you know
[13:02] when you was a little bit different than
[13:04] you are now
[13:05] I said yeah I said thank thought of it
[13:07] that you he can't remember whether you
[13:10] remember nothing that's okay God can't
[13:12] remember there's gotta be a conversion
[13:18] there's the transforming that's what
[13:20] we're talking about this evening coming
[13:21] from coming from the new birth that we
[13:23] talked about last Sunday about the old
[13:25] person must be dead if the old person
[13:27] staying somebody's got to come to life
[13:30] cuz can't you stay in the old man's dead
[13:34] then something has to come alive right
[13:37] so and I believe that that's what the
[13:40] Heavenly Father said he said I'll come
[13:41] and take up my abode in you why then say
[13:46] are we better than they know and no eyes
[13:48] for we're before food both Jew and
[13:50] Gentile that they're all understand I'll
[13:52] read verse 10 as it is written there is
[13:54] none righteous no not one
[13:57] all right now I'm gonna read you in the
[13:59] Greek and you read along I do that last
[14:03] Sunday in the Greek it's that are in the
[14:07] young Greek it says what then is the
[14:09] superiority of the Jew or what profit is
[14:13] there of circumcision much in every
[14:17] respect but first indeed because they
[14:21] were entrusted with the Oracles of God
[14:23] and
[14:25] like I said the people in the Old
[14:27] Testament they were given something to
[14:29] live by and God honored that I've gone
[14:31] on her name of him faith by giving him
[14:33] the sign of circumcision and that side
[14:34] continued on until the day that sign of
[14:38] certainty that I say it's time of a holy
[14:39] God but but a time now since the Holy
[14:42] Ghost did country for what if some did
[14:45] not believe will their unbelief but know
[14:48] the fidelity of God
[14:51] now that's verse 3 read that for some
[14:54] did not believe shall their unbelief
[14:55] make the faith of God without faith
[14:57] original sense well what if some did not
[14:59] believe what you want will their
[15:01] unbelief annulled the fidelity of God in
[15:04] other words unbelief will never override
[15:07] the faith of God that's right never
[15:12] because it makes the face of God without
[15:14] effect now some people can do it but if
[15:15] you would know that if you have that
[15:16] circumcision of the heart you want I
[15:19] believe you can't overtake you if you're
[15:22] a believer because you gotta believe
[15:24] like I said my son you've got to believe
[15:26] something you gotta believe the oh you
[15:29] died I don't care if you say the soul
[15:31] died or the ferret died or the nature
[15:33] died or whatever it's on that the nature
[15:36] that old soul that old spirit that you
[15:38] have if you were born and then God give
[15:40] you a soul then Satan what Satan does is
[15:43] what I believe he just attaches itself
[15:44] to that but he can't give you a soul or
[15:47] make yourself right
[15:49] he can't even take yourself he really
[15:52] can't take a sinner so he can
[15:55] Oh God going and touch that soul on that
[15:58] person that's why that we we see that I
[16:01] see in continuity of God that when we
[16:04] come to the Millenium see this man is
[16:08] gonna destroy the earth human beings are
[16:11] going to die but souls are not going to
[16:14] die
[16:16] because the Dead lived not for a
[16:18] thousand years they're covered down in
[16:21] that 50 yea fifth dimension right gotta
[16:25] come up in the body that they send in
[16:28] and their soul and then then now we see
[16:32] the battle to meet the Battle of Gog and
[16:34] Magog is that final battle where God's
[16:36] fire killed all souls but ecomony can
[16:38] kill Saul he kills all the demons and
[16:40] all the souls of the people you say well
[16:43] they're going to listen if you're a
[16:46] sinner you're dead
[16:47] I don't care if you're walking around
[16:48] like I said before the scripture she
[16:52] that walketh in in other words in sin
[16:54] he's dead while she live so i senators
[16:58] day he convicted already and he's going
[17:01] to his judgement and he said what God
[17:03] going to kill the soul eventually well I
[17:05] mean they may burn for it for a thousand
[17:08] million years but one day that soul of
[17:13] that person will just go back you're not
[17:17] hard to think that you got all these
[17:20] people the Bill Gates and I know I'm
[17:21] just bringing out names of people did
[17:23] not saying he's not converted I'm just
[17:25] saying you take somebody there's like I
[17:27] said it's had everything multi be and
[17:29] they are just been able to give his hope
[17:31] you know he gives more than most people
[17:33] he gives more than week than when people
[17:35] making an eternity he'll have time to
[17:37] you know the right but that's going to
[17:39] be a knock and then one day if he's not
[17:41] the converted Christian one day
[17:43] his name's never going to be mentioning
[17:45] him and his whole psyche is whole self
[17:49] was gonna dispatch to gone lots off to
[17:53] me that that scares me more actually
[17:55] there would be really that but with
[17:58] eternal life we know that that's
[17:59] continuing on so we take two we take the
[18:02] glory in that
[18:02] the less finish means everybody all
[18:05] right yeah for what if some did not
[18:07] believe where their unbelievable know
[18:09] the fidelity
[18:11] by no means policy but let God be true
[18:15] though every man be false even it has
[18:18] been written that thou mayst be
[18:20] justified in thy words and may it's
[18:22] overcome in die judgment
[18:25] but if our unrighteousness establishes
[18:28] God's righteousness what shall we say is
[18:31] that God stunt is that God than
[18:34] righteous is that guy sorry is that God
[18:37] unrighteous Flynn Flynn rat I speak the
[18:39] court in the man by no means otherwise
[18:42] how will God judge the world for if the
[18:46] truth of God percent but the reason I'm
[18:51] here for the for if the truth of God
[18:53] bounded by my falsehood to this glory
[18:57] why am i also yet judged epicenter and
[19:02] not as we have been thoughtfully accused
[19:04] like I said husband do something so
[19:10] that's our problem see the problem
[19:12] people at church you'll have a good week
[19:14] and you'll and you know everything you
[19:16] distill you have a bad week and they
[19:20] don't show up or you know little for
[19:22] three or four times you don't say I want
[19:23] to play I love my brother Brown said
[19:26] he'd stay cloudy day don't mean God's
[19:27] not with you but a sunny don't they
[19:29] don't mean it with you either
[19:30] alright that's why we're Christians to
[19:33] overcome these things and have a balance
[19:35] cuz so if you don't you like this now if
[19:40] when we overcome read that sermon how
[19:41] can we overcome but Ramsey you got that
[19:43] what it's got to be
[19:44] the evil deal well I'm circumcised even
[19:52] if you're circumcised when I hired you
[19:54] gonna throw you just gotta those who
[19:58] endure to the end that's all I gotta say
[20:00] I love that those who to endure to the
[20:02] end shall be safe okay
[20:04] to me that discovers the whole bottle
[20:07] those who endure to the end God knew if
[20:10] you were going to endure you know what
[20:11] he won't give you the Newport if he
[20:12] knows you're gonna really goof up
[20:14] somewhere hey tonight you understand
[20:18] didn't deny the whole thing he knows
[20:19] that remember he sees the end from the
[20:21] beginning that's why he can if you go by
[20:25] predestination of that way then you know
[20:27] that is the way you win but that's the
[20:30] way you win not the way that God made
[20:33] you go so what you win because being all
[20:36] this you're free more than watch this
[20:38] keeps going on down let's read now verse
[20:40] 9 and finish what then are we better
[20:44] than they know and no I swear we have
[20:46] proof before proof both Jew and Gentile
[20:49] that they are all understand as it is
[20:52] written there is none righteous no not
[20:54] one let's read what the Greek says about
[20:56] this even as it has been written there
[20:58] is none righteous not even one all right
[21:03] there is none that understands there is
[21:05] none that sees God they are all gone out
[21:10] of the way they are together become all
[21:13] together they become what not profitable
[21:15] there's nothing good
[21:17] one boy now he gets now what Paul is
[21:21] doing
[21:22] Paul's fixin to talk to the people
[21:25] that's been talking about him all human
[21:30] but God's using this for us a man
[21:33] but why Paul is fixin to tell you where
[21:35] this is coming from their throat is an
[21:38] open Sepulchre with their tongues they
[21:43] have used this eat the poison of ASPs is
[21:46] under their lips buddy he's hitting
[21:50] somebody pretty hard whose mouth is full
[21:52] of cursing and bitterness and I see
[21:54] that's not only that's not a Christian
[21:57] thank you
[21:58] all right their feet are Swift to shed
[22:01] blood destruction and misery are in
[22:07] their legs nobody is really laying down
[22:11] and the way of peace have they not known
[22:16] in other words what's he's saying the
[22:18] people that are talking about him are
[22:20] not Horning in okay they have no
[22:23] Christianity in them at all they have
[22:25] went back to their well I'm circumcised
[22:27] and you're uncircumcised oh well how I
[22:29] do and yura and I go to the temple and
[22:32] you don't go to the temple and there's
[22:35] no fear of God before their eyes now we
[22:38] know that what things soever the law
[22:41] saith it saith to them that are under
[22:44] the law that every mouth may be stopped
[22:47] and all the world may become guilty
[22:49] before God and that's what the law did
[22:52] and what a long does the law makes you
[22:55] guilty yeah okay I like the analogy
[22:59] somebody used a long time of going on
[23:01] I've tried to use it myself
[23:03] somebody was complaining and this was
[23:05] not a Christian person
[23:07] that they were changing the law that the
[23:09] the DUI law was now going to be point
[23:13] six instead of point eight you know you
[23:16] blow them the breath of a lot of tail
[23:19] meaning that you couldn't drink two
[23:22] beers and drive now you can't drink one
[23:23] beer drive so they were just complaining
[23:25] I mean I have a bottle bottle while I
[23:28] said you know what I said they can put
[23:30] at this point over one because I don't
[23:34] drink so that law has become non effect
[23:39] yeah it is a law on the book but has
[23:43] become not effective to me because I
[23:45] don't drink and if I never drink what's
[23:48] so funny right anyway the point the
[24:12] point is the law is not effective to me
[24:16] if I don't break it don't it you don't
[24:21] have to be on the book that's why
[24:24] they've brother Brown said you you know
[24:26] and like brother Bell says it'd be good
[24:28] to have warning and Christians in an
[24:29] inner part of your work aspect we still
[24:32] have problems that still you could get
[24:34] away you can do away with the DUI law
[24:38] that's why that when we get to glory
[24:40] there's not gonna be these laws that
[24:41] follow us why you don't need but now
[24:46] they do now some need it because some
[24:50] are going to be guilty before God that's
[24:52] why I'm telling you once we realize what
[24:54] we have in the new birth
[24:55] we're guiltless we're guiltless folks
[25:00] there is no law that covers menu except
[25:03] what we do in the extra right
[25:08] the internal man can be improved on
[25:14] because he is the eternal gunner he is
[25:19] the one that wrote the law put people
[25:24] under the law but came under the law so
[25:27] he can get us out from under the law
[25:29] okay so listen there's no law in the
[25:32] Bible that that's gonna that's going to
[25:35] that you're gonna worry about writing in
[25:37] your soul God can't go against God no I
[25:43] said Saul I didn't say the spirit realm
[25:45] we still got that guy to deal with now
[25:47] that's fair round guy we have to deal
[25:49] with because verse 20 therefore by the
[25:57] deeds of the law there shall no flesh be
[26:00] justified because what's going to happen
[26:05] is they're going to justified in each
[26:07] side for by the law is the knowledge of
[26:10] sin that's the same way with you and I
[26:12] let's read verse 20 in the original she
[26:14] would snitch
[26:16] therefore by works of the law no human
[26:20] being shall be justified in his presence
[26:23] for three law there is an acknowledgment
[26:27] of sin now look but now the
[26:33] righteousness of God without the law is
[26:36] manifested being witnessed by the law he
[26:40] had come to love Jesus Christ had to
[26:42] come through the law and the prophets go
[26:49] see that's a
[26:50] then we'll get into the but we will for
[26:53] just a minute there's a paradox and
[26:58] don't get me wrong I mean this way of
[27:02] saying you and I don't need the old
[27:05] testament to live life we have to have
[27:14] the Old Testament to live by we're still
[27:15] under the law but now don't get me wrong
[27:21] don't start tearing the old text when I
[27:22] think I'm throwing it away because see
[27:26] you know what God knew we would say that
[27:28] so when Corinthians he wrote it all and
[27:30] said that what these were all given for
[27:33] example to whom the ends of the world
[27:36] have come alone so he knew I stand here
[27:38] and say this today when he wrote that
[27:40] that we do have to keep them both
[27:43] because man the Old Testament is perfect
[27:45] touch of God's grace and God's bringing
[27:49] in the Gentiles and all those thing but
[27:52] you got to remember the Jews have lived
[27:54] by the Torah and the prophets for now
[27:57] 2,000 over 6,000 years from Moses till
[28:02] now same book the cheat when it's done
[28:06] they denied them aside and you're
[28:08] waiting on them to show up and only
[28:10] 144,000 are going to realize that and
[28:13] you know what they're going to do
[28:14] they're going to say and living in the
[28:17] Old Testament now we have this new
[28:20] Testament and they're going to go
[28:21] testify to the ones that are still
[28:23] living under the law and that's what's
[28:25] going to give them that's what's going
[28:26] to give them good that's just what I
[28:28] believe I don't I don't believe they
[28:30] will be killed by the United States
[28:32] government no Philippine government
[28:36] Roman government you know I don't think
[28:39] there's people inside their own place
[28:43] we're going to get
[28:44] for turning against those hey if they
[28:47] killed Jesus one time they gonna kill
[28:51] them again but the 144,000 are going to
[28:54] be saved out of that they're going to
[28:56] want realize that they're having one of
[28:58] them all now because who's coming to
[29:00] them prophets do prophets that know the
[29:06] Old Testament Elijah and Moses the
[29:09] spirit of the two and it's going to be
[29:12] so evident in the two witnesses that the
[29:14] 144,000 is going to turn and say they
[29:18] have stepped run out the old customer
[29:20] they're doing this EXO CD to away the
[29:23] Old Testament they look back and say
[29:25] they're doing the same thing water turn
[29:29] the blood fire coming down from heaven
[29:32] stopping the rain these are
[29:35] characteristics that we see but know
[29:37] what they're going to do is to stay okay
[29:38] that's fine but there's a righteous
[29:42] missing gun that that law won't touch
[29:45] let me tell you about Jesus Christ and
[29:47] now probably say oh yeah we heard about
[29:49] him he's a good man
[29:50] no they're going to say then this is the
[29:54] reason we're standing here is that he
[29:57] went to a group of Gentiles and you see
[30:00] all that chaos going on in America you
[30:01] see all the things that were happening
[30:02] over there y'all around the world it's
[30:05] because there was a group left and now
[30:08] God it's dealing with you and that's
[30:11] going to bring the other boy
[30:14] I'll come under the law and bring them
[30:17] right into even the righteousness of God
[30:22] which is by what faith of Jesus Christ
[30:24] now faith in Jesus Christ that's the
[30:28] faith of Jesus Christ now see if you
[30:30] have the new part do you have the faith
[30:32] because hey you can have faith in Jesus
[30:36] Christ to be off right your faith not
[30:39] yes faith your faith so there's a lot of
[30:42] people sitting on pieces like one you
[30:44] know when your brother Graham say you
[30:45] ask too drunk on the street if you
[30:46] believe in Jesus and probably say his
[30:50] name 30 40 times here today but not
[30:53] calling on it but by faith of Jesus
[30:56] Christ and boy I like that because that
[30:58] has the whatever Jesus's faith was it's
[31:01] come to me and you see that's where we
[31:03] get the same thing about the new birth
[31:04] please whatever desperate brother there
[31:06] with your Ayers and Dohrn answer
[31:07] whatever belief that Christ had that he
[31:09] could walk on the water that he could
[31:11] change them he could feed 5,000 he could
[31:15] change certain things raise the dead
[31:17] heal the sick that was the faith of
[31:19] Jesus Christ and now that faith of Jesus
[31:22] Christ is not in Jesus Christ anymore I
[31:26] mean it comes from me
[31:28] but he said and I'm gonna give it to you
[31:31] I will be with you even in you you see
[31:35] what we got it's what we've already got
[31:37] nice comment bubble agharti God when we
[31:39] come into the into the new birth even
[31:44] the righteousness of God which is by
[31:45] faith of G back box re by faith of Jesus
[31:49] Christ unto all and upon all them that
[31:52] believe for there is no difference now
[31:56] watch I like this scripture you say oh
[31:59] man it condemns me well it need me to
[32:02] but it shows me where I have to start
[32:06] for all have sinned so just throw
[32:10] everybody in throw everybody in the hell
[32:13] you know their own personal hello
[32:15] everybody in now and then God's going to
[32:17] watch save them out so I held a man one
[32:19] time I said he said well I got saved I
[32:21] said when you get se from connector I
[32:25] said save means that somebody throw you
[32:27] in the water if you can't swim and you
[32:29] were drowning and somebody reads down
[32:31] and picked you up and puts you in the
[32:33] boat and saved you from what you were
[32:37] doing to me nice a nice example this
[32:41] former salvation you can see if somebody
[32:43] saved you from what you were doing now
[32:45] what happens is is we have the ability
[32:47] to jump back into water if we don't get
[32:52] the new birth that's exactly what
[32:53] happened god let's do deals in the water
[32:55] yeah okay so that's the saving grace of
[32:59] Jesus Christ someone there's a lot of
[33:01] people going to be safe but there's no a
[33:04] lot of people going to get any birth
[33:05] right like I was telling you Sunday
[33:07] there's a big difference one on a big
[33:08] difference there's a difference in
[33:09] eternal life a new you birthed and
[33:11] you've heard there's something so
[33:12] special so special that only a small
[33:17] group of people is going to get it and
[33:18] the reason they got it if they believe
[33:20] and know about Hamelin I said I don't
[33:24] have a handle it but we come up to the
[33:26] day now we got to know how to handle cuz
[33:29] your power without character satanic
[33:31] we've seen it happen
[33:31] thousands of time for all that standing
[33:35] come short of the glory of God amen well
[33:37] I believe that 100% you leave you get
[33:44] you out though he's Eugene yellow water
[33:46] being justified freely by His grace
[33:49] through the redemption that is in Christ
[33:52] Jesus so he brought back all sin come
[33:55] sort of learning time think I don't know
[33:58] but being justified freely by His grace
[34:00] through the redemption that is in Christ
[34:01] Jesus look whom God has set forth to be
[34:05] a propitiation through faith in his
[34:07] blood to declare his righteousness book
[34:10] his righteousness
[34:12] omission of sins that are past I read
[34:15] this before remember this is under
[34:17] justification when we did the seal when
[34:19] we talked about justification we read
[34:20] next victor up there
[34:22] remember brother brown saved I did give
[34:25] you just maybe for justification chopped
[34:27] off your past sins and then they were
[34:28] remembered anymore remission of sins
[34:31] that are past through the forbearance of
[34:34] done you know why Paul said that because
[34:36] there's something that's going to keep
[34:37] piling to stand up there something
[34:41] that's not there going to go on to
[34:44] sanctification they're going to go on to
[34:45] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and never
[34:46] thought to eat their past is nothing to
[34:49] be brought up again right to declare I
[34:52] say it this time his righteousness to
[34:54] Apollo has none that he may be just and
[34:58] the justifier we read the scripture
[35:00] people of him which believeth in Jesus
[35:03] guess what I'm telling you if you listen
[35:05] to these seals that were brand ever
[35:08] scripture you read is going to touch
[35:10] something that we're talking about
[35:12] because if it's the plan of redemption
[35:15] if it's the total plan of redemption the
[35:18] only way you're going to be redeemed is
[35:20] by what I'm reading and by what you read
[35:22] them in that's the only way you don't
[35:24] get retain comes Redemption perpetuation
[35:29] who fades in this blood to declare his
[35:30] righteousness for the remission of sins
[35:32] that are past through the forbearance of
[35:34] God to declare I say at this time of his
[35:36] righteousness but now remember it's his
[35:42] rocks isn't right but hold on then it
[35:45] were in Aaron's and join Adams you gotta
[35:48] take that and put it right inside here
[35:49] that's right
[35:51] [Applause]
[35:53] cuz it in myself I'm not Roger
[35:56] but that thing that's inside of me is
[35:58] you just I start believing that that
[36:00] thing inside of you is just as righteous
[36:01] and God it's not just as righteous as
[36:03] God it is done that's why I say this
[36:07] father's name means more to me than ever
[36:09] you've got a father that you're supposed
[36:12] to walk like and he's giving you all the
[36:14] provisions that mom gave us all the
[36:15] provisions we need it we boost up bad
[36:17] most of all right but now the heavenly
[36:20] father won't he won't call you one dance
[36:23] that can't make them around work you
[36:24] don't tell you one basket now I'm gonna
[36:26] be gone I can't get to you no he's not
[36:29] that way 26 to declare I say at this
[36:35] time of his righteousness they might be
[36:37] just and the justifier who is the
[36:41] justified he is but he's justifying that
[36:44] him is us the justifier of him which
[36:48] believeth in Jesus so never word him he
[36:52] justified it where is boasting them it
[36:57] is excluded by the what law of works
[37:02] nay but by the law of faith we do them
[37:05] under that law we live under a law faith
[37:09] therefore we conclude no what look from
[37:13] right here at the worst one Paul is
[37:15] going to conclude therefore we can
[37:19] conclude another once you do bringing us
[37:20] somebody bringing it to this point right
[37:22] here that a man is justified by faith
[37:26] without the deeds of the law
[37:30] [Applause]
[37:30] [Music]
[37:32] I'll just put up
[37:34] [Applause]
[37:34] [Music]
[37:36] that's right that's right we'll see that
[37:40] faith of Jesus Christ that we read is
[37:43] right here we conclude let's see what
[37:48] that were directing me okay we got a
[37:50] little few minutes I love this app a lot
[37:55] of words won't work okay
[37:59] it mange
[38:03] [Music]
[38:03] [Applause]
[38:06] go down here to reckon to count compute
[38:10] calculate count over to take into
[38:12] account all right notion of all what you
[38:14] know about
[38:15] well to take you to count all this I'm
[38:17] saying taking all this into account
[38:21] we're going to conclude are some eyes or
[38:24] have a summation that a man is justified
[38:26] by faith without the deeds of the law so
[38:30] he's doing away because right hand look
[38:32] is he the god of the cube that woman is
[38:35] he the god of the Jew only is he not of
[38:38] the Gentile yes of the Gentile also
[38:40] let's finish reading we'll get it done
[38:42] seeing it as one God hallelujah
[38:44] we shall justify the circumcision by
[38:47] faith and the uncircumcision through
[38:50] faith because the uncircumcision has the
[38:53] law that they live a heathen
[38:56] so through faith they got it see it now
[38:58] the ones that are justified by
[39:00] circumcision by faith they're already in
[39:03] ones that are in the ones around all
[39:05] gonna be my faith they faint do we then
[39:09] make void the law through faith here we
[39:11] go now Paul can we take the whole Old
[39:13] Testament throw it away god forbid we
[39:16] establish the law you are the only ones
[39:20] that can live the law because there is a
[39:24] law there is a DUI law but the unwritten
[39:29] law is that you can drive all the time
[39:32] you want to
[39:33] right you just can't pass this right
[39:39] here if you start drinking then if you
[39:42] drink and drive this law I'm sorry this
[39:46] law takes over this law the law says you
[39:49] can drive you drive from when you're 16
[39:52] years old you can drive there is your
[39:53] law but there are laws on top of that
[39:57] law that says if you drink if you run a
[39:59] red line if you speed if you do this if
[40:01] you reckless driving you see what I'm
[40:03] saying so we need to live under a law
[40:05] that says we can drive we live under a
[40:07] law we establish the law that the law
[40:09] and the letter is something for us to
[40:11] read take into account but we live by
[40:14] the faith of Jesus Christ
[40:17] I like this book of Romans I'm down yeah
[40:20] I really enjoy
[40:22] [Music]
