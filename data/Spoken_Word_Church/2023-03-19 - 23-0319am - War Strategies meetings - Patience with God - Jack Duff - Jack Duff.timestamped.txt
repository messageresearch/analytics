[31:18] um your pastor brother Dale amen his his
[31:23] ministry has just had a tremendous
[31:25] impact I was talking to him yesterday he
[31:27] said you think 50 years is enough
[31:31] and uh just the time that he has given
[31:35] to serving the bride of Christ not just
[31:37] here in Lula uh but your ministry has
[31:41] impacted people all over the world and
[31:44] uh and we're very grateful for that and
[31:46] I met um you know brother Wade a number
[31:49] of years ago and just really appreciate
[31:51] the connection that we made there and I
[31:53] was just so happy to hear about the
[31:56] opportunity to come and be in fellowship
[31:58] and uh and I'm glad we were able to make
[32:01] it happen this weekend I actually
[32:02] thought I had a another place that I'm
[32:05] supposed to be when he when he reached
[32:07] out to me and then I had called me tried
[32:09] to confirm and said no I forgot to tell
[32:11] you brother Jack we got somebody else
[32:12] that weekend okay no problem that I know
[32:16] where I'm supposed to be that weekend
[32:18] amen so I'm I'm here and by by the plan
[32:22] of God
[32:22] and uh you know we're happy so uh my my
[32:26] wife is with me uh sister Erica and uh
[32:29] my my youngest daughter uh Sister Sarah
[32:32] and um a couple of things that I I know
[32:36] I I'm on a limited time schedule uh this
[32:39] morning but I did promise by the way I
[32:42] will return
[32:44] now uh
[32:50] unfortunate this year is a really really
[32:52] tight year I got a lot of things
[32:54] happening uh this year you know personal
[32:57] things as well as Ministry things but
[33:00] um you know and and trying to trying to
[33:02] put all that together and you know one
[33:04] of the big things somebody asked me just
[33:06] to share is that we are we're in the
[33:08] process of uh negotiating on a new
[33:10] church
[33:11] and uh you know we we run into just a
[33:15] little roadblock but we believe God can
[33:17] help us overcome that and uh you know
[33:21] and and you know we we actually had a
[33:23] contract signed and once we start doing
[33:25] our due diligence we found some things
[33:27] that didn't necessarily uh line up they
[33:30] didn't tell us everything so we we
[33:32] pulled out and we resubmitted a new
[33:34] contract at a lower price and uh you
[33:38] know and they're saying no we don't want
[33:39] to accept that price
[33:41] but you know we think it's a fair price
[33:44] based on the information that we we have
[33:46] and um even last night I left here and I
[33:49] saw they had updated their listing
[33:50] they've actually lowered the listing
[33:52] price uh on this and I'm like you all
[33:56] are getting closer to where we want to
[33:57] be
[33:59] so so I'm just waiting on the Lord right
[34:02] and uh I mean we kind of reached the
[34:05] spot where only God can kind of step in
[34:07] at this point in time and uh and and I'm
[34:10] reminded of scripture says that he he
[34:12] looks for opportunities uh to come on
[34:15] behalf of his people right so this is an
[34:18] opportunity for him to do that so we uh
[34:21] just keep us in prayer we we ask that
[34:23] you you would do that for us
[34:26] um and someone asks was I related to
[34:29] sister Brenda Lewis
[34:31] yes
[34:33] sister Brenda Lewis is my aunt and she
[34:37] and my mom there were nine kids and uh
[34:41] and out of the nine kids she was one one
[34:43] year older than my mom
[34:45] my mom is Sister Ellen Burrs and um uh
[34:49] but you know they were they were the
[34:51] only two out of the nine kids that came
[34:52] into the message so
[34:54] um you know
[34:56] it is what it is but uh but yeah sister
[34:59] sister Lewis is my aunt and uh and very
[35:02] very grateful it's gonna take a stronger
[35:04] win than this
[35:07] oh man
[35:08] to keep me from my promises
[35:11] it's gonna take a stronger wind than
[35:14] this
[35:15] to turn me around gonna take a stronger
[35:19] wind than this
[35:21] because my feet are on
[35:24] Solid Ground
[35:33] and she wrote another song and says
[35:44] there is one the battle is over it's
[35:49] already done
[35:51] when your confession of faith is
[35:54] wavering yeah and doubt is bombarding
[35:58] your mind
[36:00] just speak it is written just like Jesus
[36:04] said the angel of the Lord is right on
[36:07] time because it's already done
[36:12] I say that to the new church it's
[36:15] already done
[36:18] the victory is one the battle is over
[36:22] it's already done
[36:25] amen hallelujah and we used to say I
[36:28] know that it's done
[36:31] oh Hallelujah we we we've we've we in we
[36:35] thank the Lord for us she passed away
[36:38] on um I know I can't remember the year
[36:42] but I already know the date October 7th
[36:46] and um we were
[36:48] um when we looked at that because God is
[36:50] found in everything
[36:52] and October is the 10th month
[36:55] and on the seventh day
[36:57] and she believed Revelation 10 7.
[37:00] amen so we thank God for her
[37:05] um somebody asked me to share my
[37:06] testimony and I I would have to say this
[37:08] my testimony is a sermon by itself and I
[37:13] would love to do it you know because
[37:14] here's here's the thing that I found out
[37:16] is that it's best for you to share your
[37:18] own testimony otherwise the devil will
[37:20] try to give you one yeah
[37:23] with all the stuff that people say this
[37:25] and that they'll give you their own
[37:26] personal testimony but when you share
[37:28] what happened to you
[37:30] then nobody can take that from you
[37:33] amen I want my daughter to come
[37:36] um she is going to sing and she had a
[37:39] little song in her heart that I think

[44:37] band
[44:39] amen God bless you all
[44:42] amen amen
[44:44] um we were we had a wonderful time on
[44:48] yesterday with the with the youth
[44:51] service and towards the end of the
[44:54] service
[44:55] uh brother
[44:58] Wade made a comment
[45:01] about something that you all have been
[45:03] doing
[45:04] uh in regards to the
[45:09] um
[45:10] the statue of a perfect man I believe he
[45:13] said that you all were they've been
[45:15] teaching on that so when I heard that I
[45:18] said you know
[45:19] um I think I got something in my
[45:21] my notebook
[45:24] uh that would kind of go right along
[45:26] with with uh with that so I wanted to
[45:29] just kind of bring a little thought this
[45:31] morning that would just kind of connect
[45:32] with what was already being taught here
[45:35] uh brother
[45:37] um
[45:38] um brother Wade challenged me it says
[45:40] try to choke us
[45:43] and I knew right dancing no not me I
[45:45] ain't going down that road not not in
[45:48] this church no
[45:50] there's some fine teaching that comes
[45:53] for for Miss Ministries
[45:57] so all I come to do is just put my
[46:00] shoulder to the wheel
[46:01] amen and uh amen we thank the Lord for
[46:04] all things so
[46:06] um I know that you all are familiar with
[46:09] um most of these scriptures but um there
[46:11] will be a slight uh slant on you know
[46:14] what we will bring to you today
[46:17] um so let's let's stand let's read a
[46:19] couple
[46:20] um
[46:21] scriptures a few years ago we're going
[46:23] to go to Second Peter chapter one just
[46:25] read from there first and then then I'll
[46:28] I'll go into Joshua five but a few years
[46:31] ago I I did a a series of sermons on the
[46:35] um uh on the the statue of a perfect man
[46:39] but I took it from an angle of uh
[46:42] finding different Wars that were uh in
[46:48] the script in the Old Testament where
[46:50] the virtue would have been represented
[46:53] in that war
[46:54] and uh so I I titled it war strategies
[46:59] right and I used the Seven Virtues as a
[47:02] strategy so we started with faith and
[47:04] went all the way up through uh you know
[47:06] charity and we just found different
[47:08] places in the Bible where that virtue
[47:10] would have been expressed in that war it
[47:12] was a war strategy all right so uh just
[47:16] just you know we'll we'll pick out one
[47:17] of those today and use it and then we're
[47:19] going to use patience today all right so
[47:22] here uh in the scripture uh second Peter
[47:24] 1 verse three
[47:25] according as his divine power hath given
[47:28] unto us all things that pertain unto
[47:31] life and godliness through the knowledge
[47:33] of him that hath called us to glory and
[47:35] virtue whereby are given unto us
[47:38] exceeding great and precious promises
[47:40] that by these you might be partakers of
[47:43] the divine nature having escaped the
[47:44] corruption that is in the world through
[47:47] lust and besides this given all
[47:49] diligence add to your faith virtue into
[47:52] virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[47:54] Temperance and to Temperance patience
[47:57] and to patience godliness and to
[48:00] Godliness really kindness and brother
[48:02] and to brotherly kindness charity for if
[48:04] these things be in you and abound they
[48:07] have to stay they make you that ye shall
[48:09] neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the
[48:12] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but
[48:15] he that lacketh these things is blind
[48:18] and cannot see it far off and have
[48:21] forgotten that he was purged from his
[48:24] old sins
[48:25] amen and it's just amazing to me that
[48:28] the man that actually took the ear off
[48:33] of a soldier that was coming to take
[48:35] Jesus is the man that's writing to us
[48:37] these things
[48:38] it shows you what the power
[48:40] transformation can do in our life amen
[48:44] praise the Lord uh let's go back over
[48:46] here to the Book of Joshua of chapter
[48:49] five and we will just catch a a verse
[48:53] there
[48:54] a couple verses starting at verse 13.
[48:57] Joshua chapter 5 uh it says
[49:02] and it came to pass when Joshua was by
[49:04] Jericho that he lifted up his eyes and
[49:06] looked behold there stood a man over
[49:09] against him with a sword drawn in his
[49:11] hand and Joshua went unto him and said
[49:13] unto him aren't thou for us or for our
[49:16] adversaries and it's that neighbor
[49:19] that's captain of the hosts of the Lord
[49:21] am I now come and Joshua fell on his
[49:24] face to the uh to the Earth and did
[49:27] worship instead of him what saith my
[49:29] Lord unto his servant uh and the captain
[49:32] of the Lord's host said unto Joshua lose
[49:34] that shoe from off that foot
[49:36] though the place where on thou standards
[49:39] is Holy and Joshua did so amen let's
[49:43] pray father we thank you for the ability
[49:44] to read the word of God but we know it
[49:48] takes the Holy Spirit to bring Clarity
[49:50] to what it is that we've read take
[49:52] control over this portion of the service
[49:53] thank you for all that has been done
[49:55] thus far the worship the testimony uh
[49:58] God the specials everything that's been
[50:00] done uh that's been done Lord and we can
[50:02] feel your presence here we know that
[50:04] you're welcome in this place God speak
[50:06] to us through your word and may Hearts
[50:08] be transform and change by the power of
[50:11] the spoken word it's in Jesus name we
[50:13] pray amen God bless you you can be
[50:16] seated amen
[50:19] um and again I bring greetings from our
[50:21] church there uh in West Palm Beach
[50:23] Florida
[50:25] um spirit and Truth Tabernacle is our is
[50:27] our church and
[50:29] um my you know we
[50:32] um and we don't experience weather like
[50:34] this uh down where we're from amen it
[50:38] this might be the coldest day in in
[50:41] January and we get only a few hours of
[50:44] that then the sun comes up and it's all
[50:46] going away
[50:47] uh so uh when we saw 20 something
[50:50] degrees say my goodness uh but you know
[50:53] nonetheless we're happy to be here hey
[50:55] man so uh this morning I want to just
[50:57] take for a a title uh war strategies
[51:00] patience with God Amen patience with God
[51:03] when you go through the um uh the the
[51:06] statue of the perfect man brother
[51:07] Brandon when he gets to dealing with
[51:09] patience uh he uh he actually talks
[51:12] about two different
[51:13] um types of patients he says we need to
[51:16] have patience with God and then he says
[51:18] we need to have patience with one
[51:19] another right so uh so that you know and
[51:22] when I preached this at home I actually
[51:24] took it uh I went went both directions I
[51:27] went one with patients with with one
[51:28] another and then one patients with God
[51:30] so I want to just bring that that
[51:32] portion of it patience with God and as I
[51:35] mentioned we find different strategies
[51:38] amen where where these virtues might
[51:40] have been
[51:42] um manifested in certain uh Wars that
[51:46] happened in in the scripture certain
[51:47] battles that happen and uh just uh just
[51:50] uh uh you know just to get us started
[51:52] here I when we started out with faith
[51:54] being the foundation the the the war
[51:57] that I looked at in scripture was uh
[51:59] with what happened with Gideon all right
[52:02] and there's a there's a number of things
[52:03] uh you know that we can we can look in
[52:05] the scripture David and Goliath I think
[52:07] David certainly stepped out on faith uh
[52:09] before he went out and fought Goliath I
[52:11] mean a little little itty bitty bitty
[52:13] fellas getting ready to fight a giant
[52:14] Faith was manifested and David when he
[52:17] went out but Gideon's Army also we saw
[52:20] Faith manifested there uh and you know
[52:23] when when you just look at the numbers
[52:24] Gideon started out uh in a battle with
[52:27] 32 000
[52:29] um Warriors that he was going to fight
[52:31] with but it was going to be a 135 000
[52:34] million nights that we're gonna go
[52:35] against 32 000 Israelites now when you
[52:39] look at that the odds when you have a
[52:41] hundred and thirty five thousand
[52:42] midianites versus 32 000 mini uh
[52:44] Israelites uh the odds were four
[52:47] soldiers to one right now God tells uh
[52:51] get in it says look
[52:53] if there's anyone that's afraid and
[52:55] really doesn't want to go to go to
[52:56] battle just make an announcement and see
[52:58] who all's afraid and just let them go
[53:00] back because we don't need them to go
[53:02] out to the battlefield and and to and to
[53:04] display that fear out on the battlefield
[53:06] so he says just let them go right now
[53:08] and uh and so when Gideon made the
[53:10] announcement he saw 22 000 men walk away
[53:14] and now he's down to 10 000 soldiers
[53:17] right and now the odds have just
[53:19] increased we have 13.5 I gotta fight
[53:23] 13.5 men in order to overcome in this in
[53:27] this this battle right and uh and here
[53:29] you know it's 13.5 to one soldier in
[53:32] Israel and so God does another thing
[53:35] says now uh let them go down to the
[53:38] water and and those that laugh like dogs
[53:40] put them to this side and those that
[53:43] prostrate themselves put them to another
[53:45] side and when he gets down there he sees
[53:47] that those that lap like dogs they were
[53:49] 300. it says that's the group that I
[53:51] want to go with now the odds are 450
[53:55] soldiers to one
[53:57] it takes Faith to go out into a battle
[54:01] like this
[54:02] it takes Faith to know that it's not
[54:05] just you trying to overcome the enemy
[54:07] but it's God that is in the midst of
[54:09] this battle
[54:10] Hallelujah and if God was in the midst
[54:13] of the battle with Gideon then God is in
[54:15] the midst of the battle with you this
[54:17] morning I don't care what the odds are
[54:19] if God is for us who can be against us
[54:25] blessed be the name of the Lord amen
[54:28] there was a note that I had in my Bible
[54:31] it said Gideon strange battle strategy
[54:35] counted on the elements of surprise
[54:38] confusion and the enemy's mistaken
[54:41] assumption that they had fallen prey to
[54:44] and and
[54:45] innumerable uh attacking force that the
[54:49] divinely conceived plan worked better
[54:51] than any man could have dared to Hope
[54:56] hallelujah amen we know God gave them
[54:59] the Victory and even when when Gideon
[55:01] was afraid he went down into the Animus
[55:03] camp and the dream was interpreted about
[55:06] Gideon coming in and wiping out that
[55:08] Army Hallelujah he had it he was
[55:10] encouraged his faithless increase and he
[55:12] was willing to go out and step forward
[55:14] in the battle
[55:16] brother Brandon when he talks about
[55:18] patients in the Statue of a perfect man
[55:21] he brings out seven characters uh one is
[55:24] Abraham the the second one was Noah the
[55:27] third was Moses the fourth was the
[55:29] Hebrew boys the fifth was Daniel the
[55:31] sixth was Paul and then on the seventh
[55:34] the seventh a group of characters he put
[55:36] the Believers on the day of Pentecost
[55:38] when he talked about patience there so
[55:40] here you know the first quote that I
[55:42] want to read here out of statue of a
[55:44] perfect manifest patience with what he
[55:47] says what kind of patience first thing
[55:49] is have patience with God if you got
[55:52] real genuine Faith you have real genuine
[55:57] patience amen because Faith worketh
[56:01] patience When God says anything you
[56:03] believe in that's all you got patience
[56:06] say well I asked him last night to hear
[56:09] me and I'm just as sick this morning oh
[56:12] my what patience right God told Abraham
[56:15] and 25 years later uh there wasn't even
[56:19] one son he was still believing he was
[56:23] patient with God and we know the
[56:24] scripture says that is Faith got
[56:26] stronger the more he waited I want to
[56:30] that can be our testimony that our faith
[56:32] actually gets stronger the longer we
[56:35] wait
[56:36] amen hey man it goes on to say this put
[56:38] him up put him always before you let him
[56:40] be the next Crossing thing you can't
[56:43] cross him so just keep him before you he
[56:46] said so it's going to happen uh so it's
[56:49] going to happen to see keep him before
[56:50] you that's right now here you know just
[56:53] a little note here
[56:54] um God told Abraham in 25 years later
[56:57] there was there wasn't even one sign he
[57:01] was still believing he was patient with
[57:03] God uh-huh brother random says that now
[57:06] I like I like that that statement
[57:08] because you know I can imagine Abraham
[57:10] going to the doctor with his wife
[57:13] and maybe uh you know the doctor you
[57:16] know in the doctor's office and you know
[57:18] and uh uh you got all the the the you
[57:20] know the workers there and maybe they
[57:22] they they sent a note back there to the
[57:24] doctor say it's Abraham again
[57:28] ham again and
[57:30] uh sir you know look
[57:33] um we tried this last year there was
[57:35] there was nothing and it said well try
[57:37] it again docs
[57:39] Abraham please I mean I'm year after
[57:42] year maybe month after month and and all
[57:45] these visits to the doctor and and it's
[57:47] like this guy's just really lost it but
[57:50] one day he shows up at the doctors say
[57:52] please just try it again though and Doc
[57:55] goes and runs the test and all of a
[57:56] sudden something shows up my God I mean
[58:00] and and it took Abraham to be patient
[58:02] with God just knowing that God was going
[58:04] to fulfill the promise that he had made
[58:06] to him we got to have that same type of
[58:08] patience as Abraham's seed
[58:12] here in Luke 21 19 says in your patience
[58:16] possession of your souls very important
[58:19] for you to have patience because in your
[58:21] patience possession your souls let's
[58:24] look at this quote out of Revelations uh
[58:26] Philadelphia Church AIDS Revelation 3 10
[58:29] uh brother Brandon says this because
[58:31] thou has kept the word of my patience I
[58:35] also will keep thee from the hour of
[58:37] Temptation will shall come upon all the
[58:39] world to try them uh that dwell upon the
[58:42] Earth what does he mean by the word of
[58:46] his patience Hebrews 6 3 13-15 for when
[58:49] God made promise to Abraham because he
[58:51] could swear by no greater he swear by
[58:53] himself
[58:55] Sam's truly blessing I Will Bless thee
[58:57] and uh multiplying I will multiply them
[59:00] so after he had patiently endured he
[59:04] obtained the promise you see the spirit
[59:07] is speaking about the word of God which
[59:09] is given to us to wait for the
[59:12] Fulfillment of that word required
[59:15] patience even as it did in the case of
[59:18] Abraham you know I just love this
[59:20] because I'm going through this right now
[59:23] in my own personal life as I'm waiting I
[59:25] know God has given me a promise amen and
[59:27] I'm holding to that promise I'm
[59:30] believing him for the new church I'm
[59:31] believing him for our new school I'm
[59:33] believing him for all these things but I
[59:35] have to wait and patience don't get
[59:38] ahead of God just we impatient when God
[59:41] has made your promises made you a
[59:43] promise amen I'm reminded of a testimony
[59:45] one time that brother Episcopal shared
[59:47] and I'll come back to that uh just leave
[59:49] it right right where we are there uh
[59:52] I'll um brother brother bisca was um was
[59:55] with brother Branham and um and uh he
[59:59] said that they were in the car together
[1:00:00] and they were they were they were
[1:00:01] hunting for a certain animal and um and
[1:00:05] brother bisca wanted this animal so
[1:00:06] brother brother brother Branham and him
[1:00:08] they're driving out in the car and uh
[1:00:10] he's like I didn't get the animals like
[1:00:12] uh don't worry God's gonna give it to
[1:00:13] you brother he's like uh okay brother
[1:00:15] you know we're in the car now and I
[1:00:18] didn't get it I don't know he said just
[1:00:19] just wait brother God's gonna give it to
[1:00:20] you he said all of a sudden they're
[1:00:22] driving down the street and this animal
[1:00:23] that brother bisco wanted comes walking
[1:00:25] across the street
[1:00:28] and brother bisco's like now if he sees
[1:00:30] the car he's gonna start running he's
[1:00:32] like no brother no don't worry don't
[1:00:33] worry he's like brother Brandon stop the
[1:00:35] car if you see the car he's gonna he's
[1:00:36] gonna run I can get him right here he's
[1:00:38] like no don't worry brother just let me
[1:00:40] just keep driving and he kept driving
[1:00:42] next thing you know he says uh now
[1:00:44] brother this is really going to be
[1:00:45] impossible because if I shoot the animal
[1:00:47] he's gonna drop in the street and I
[1:00:49] don't have any way to get that animal
[1:00:51] out of here to the I don't I mean this
[1:00:53] is this is going to be impossible he
[1:00:54] says no brother when God is giving you
[1:00:57] something he's giving you something
[1:00:59] so he drove right up on the animal drove
[1:01:03] right up on him said now get out brother
[1:01:04] and shoot the animal brother Bethel got
[1:01:06] out shot the animal and he watched the
[1:01:09] animal walk
[1:01:10] walk off the off the off the street walk
[1:01:13] into a ditch and lay down where nobody
[1:01:16] could see him but but brother Branham
[1:01:18] and brother biscal knew he was there
[1:01:21] when God is giving you something he's
[1:01:23] giving you he works it all out with his
[1:01:26] own plan you don't have to add anything
[1:01:28] to his plan he works it all out
[1:01:31] according to his men
[1:01:33] we just need to be patient
[1:01:36] let's keep reading this quote he said
[1:01:39] this so after he had patiently endured
[1:01:41] he obtained the promise you see the
[1:01:43] spirit speaking about the word of God
[1:01:45] which is given to us to wait for the
[1:01:47] Fulfillment of that word required
[1:01:49] patience even as it did in the case of
[1:01:51] Abraham he endured as seeing him who was
[1:01:55] invisible he was patient and then the
[1:01:57] work finally was fulfilled this is the
[1:02:00] way God teaches his people patience
[1:02:03] why if he fulfilled his word in physical
[1:02:08] manifestations the very instant you
[1:02:11] prayed you would never learn patience
[1:02:14] but with would become even more
[1:02:17] impatient with life so if God answers
[1:02:20] your prayer like that see we think we
[1:02:23] live in the microwave age and we think
[1:02:26] we serve a microwave God he doesn't
[1:02:28] operate that way amen so you have to
[1:02:31] pray and then you have to wait then you
[1:02:34] have to pray and then you have to work
[1:02:35] but the longer you wait your patience is
[1:02:38] developing
[1:02:40] oh blessed be the name of the Lord let
[1:02:43] our faith
[1:02:44] hunger as we wait let our praise get
[1:02:46] stronger as we wait on God
[1:02:49] hallelujah amen he says you become more
[1:02:52] even more impatient with life let me
[1:02:54] show you this truth even more fully set
[1:02:57] forth Hebrews 11 17 by faith Abraham
[1:03:00] when he was tried offered up Isaac and
[1:03:02] he that had received the promises the
[1:03:04] word of God offered up his only begotten
[1:03:07] son there it is Abraham was tried after
[1:03:10] yeah he received the Word of Promise
[1:03:13] most think as soon as we pray in Jesus
[1:03:17] name over the good Promises of God that
[1:03:20] there could not be a trial amen
[1:03:23] hallelujah but here it says that Abraham
[1:03:25] was tried after he received the promise
[1:03:29] you're going to be tried after you get
[1:03:31] the encouragement of the inspiration
[1:03:33] from scripture you'll be tried after
[1:03:35] that now you got a hold to that word
[1:03:39] glory to God you can't look at anything
[1:03:41] you gotta hold to that word
[1:03:44] hallelujah hallelujah If Abraham had to
[1:03:46] do it that way that's the same way we're
[1:03:48] gonna have to do it blessed be the name
[1:03:50] of the Lord he says um uh but but here
[1:03:53] it says Abraham was trying to after he
[1:03:54] receive the promise that's exactly
[1:03:56] correct according to the psalmist
[1:03:58] referring to Joseph uh uh in Psalm 105
[1:04:01] 19 until the time that his work came the
[1:04:04] word of the Lord trod him God gives us
[1:04:07] exceeding great and precious promises he
[1:04:10] has promised to fulfill them he will yes
[1:04:14] amen I like that he promised the
[1:04:16] Fulfillment and he will but from the
[1:04:19] time we pray until the time we get the
[1:04:22] answer we must learn to see patience
[1:04:26] into our souls for only impatience do we
[1:04:29] possess life
[1:04:31] he says may God help us to learn this
[1:04:35] lesson even as we know the people of the
[1:04:37] six age learn uh patients we read the
[1:04:40] history of their of the lives of those
[1:04:42] great Christians what a car what a
[1:04:44] contrast we see between their lives and
[1:04:46] hours for they were so patient and quiet
[1:04:49] and today we are all overcome
[1:04:52] and and and and over impatience and
[1:04:56] haste
[1:04:57] and and the prophet is telling nothing
[1:04:59] but the truth we overcome with it
[1:05:01] I mean I I can't wait for nothing yeah I
[1:05:05] can't wait in line if the line is too
[1:05:08] long I'm out of there I mean I thought
[1:05:09] they said this was fast food I'm on to
[1:05:12] the next place no we gotta learn
[1:05:14] patience and God sends us trial after
[1:05:17] trial after trial so that we can develop
[1:05:20] our patience
[1:05:23] he said Noah uh was patient Noah
[1:05:27] preached a hundred and twenty years amen
[1:05:30] uh he says plenty of patience not even
[1:05:32] due felt from Heaven Wasn't nothing just
[1:05:34] as Dusty As It Ever Was for 120 years
[1:05:37] but he was patient
[1:05:40] waiting on God he was he was patience uh
[1:05:43] here in this next quote he says uh Noah
[1:05:45] had patience yeah Noah had real Godly
[1:05:47] patience God said I'm gonna Destroy This
[1:05:49] World With rain and Noah preacher 120
[1:05:52] years plenty of patience not even Duke
[1:05:54] fell from heaven wasn't nothing just a
[1:05:55] Dusty uh just as Dusty It Ever Was for
[1:05:58] 120 years but he was just he was patient
[1:06:00] then God tries your patience look at
[1:06:03] that look at that statement God
[1:06:06] we think it's the devil
[1:06:09] we want to blame everything on the devil
[1:06:11] I mean I saw this little
[1:06:13] um a cartoon or something like that and
[1:06:16] Satan was kind of going in and out of
[1:06:17] the presence of God and he was just
[1:06:19] upset you know and it sets up and so God
[1:06:22] started talking what's what you're so
[1:06:23] upset about he's like they're blaming it
[1:06:25] blaming me for things I never even did
[1:06:30] I want you to get this God is trying
[1:06:32] your patience
[1:06:34] [Music]
[1:06:35] whatever trial that you're going through
[1:06:37] this morning
[1:06:38] God is trying your patience
[1:06:41] God tries these virtues hallelujah amen
[1:06:46] it says after he told Noah now he said
[1:06:49] now I want you to go ahead and get in
[1:06:50] the ark I'm going to run the animals in
[1:06:54] there I want you to get in climb way
[1:06:57] upstairs now so you can look out top
[1:06:59] window now I want I want you to get in
[1:07:01] there I want you to tell these people
[1:07:03] tomorrow what I've been preaching for
[1:07:05] 120 years is going to take place all
[1:07:07] right you go down there and tell them
[1:07:09] now I'm gonna skip this next one here uh
[1:07:12] because let me just kind of help you
[1:07:14] understand how God tried Noah's patience
[1:07:17] Noah's inside the ark uh with the
[1:07:20] animals and and they know that God is
[1:07:22] actually is the one that has shut the
[1:07:24] door God has closed it nobody else can
[1:07:26] come in no matter how much they're
[1:07:27] knocking but there's been no rain for
[1:07:29] seven days
[1:07:30] and they're still inside the ark locked
[1:07:32] up and the way God tries the patience is
[1:07:35] is Miss Noah
[1:07:38] she comes up and she says uh do you
[1:07:41] think that this was right
[1:07:44] because we locked in here now Noah we
[1:07:47] got all the animals we locked in and no
[1:07:49] rain has been on the first day no rain
[1:07:51] on the second day and I can imagine
[1:07:53] maybe the kids was having a conversation
[1:07:57] with Mom
[1:07:58] and uh they like now mama you need to go
[1:08:00] tell Daddy something yeah yeah
[1:08:01] Hallelujah so miss Noah shows up
[1:08:04] and she tries Abraham by saying do you
[1:08:08] think we're we're in the will of God
[1:08:09] what about this what about that and
[1:08:11] Abraham cannot ex I mean I'm sorry Noah
[1:08:13] cannot explain any of these things no
[1:08:16] one knows that God told me to preach
[1:08:18] it's gonna rain I preached it for 120
[1:08:20] years he sent the animals I didn't go
[1:08:23] looking for these animals but God sent
[1:08:25] the animals to me I'm inside there and I
[1:08:28] don't know when it's gonna rain but I do
[1:08:29] know this much it's gonna rain
[1:08:35] but God is trying his patience
[1:08:38] even through his family
[1:08:44] he endured
[1:08:46] he saw the rain coming they saw the rain
[1:08:48] come they knew daddy wasn't crazy
[1:08:49] anymore
[1:08:51] God has a way of proving things in his
[1:08:52] own time but until then you have to wait
[1:08:55] and
[1:08:56] patience
[1:08:58] brother Brandon said Moses have patience
[1:09:04] oh my I love the Lord
[1:09:06] uh and and and and the way that Moses
[1:09:09] showed his patience let's look at this
[1:09:12] at a quote here it says uh why
[1:09:16] the way he showed it is is just go back
[1:09:19] up with he demonstrated his patients
[1:09:21] when he stood before Pharaoh with the
[1:09:22] snakes
[1:09:23] this is how Moses showed us patience he
[1:09:25] demonstrated when he stood before
[1:09:27] Pharaoh with the snakes
[1:09:29] says um and just just get in your mind
[1:09:32] how Moses walks out there and you know
[1:09:34] he knew he had come in contact with a
[1:09:36] supernatural God and had his commission
[1:09:39] and he walked out with that stick and
[1:09:40] and even you know when you look at in
[1:09:42] the scripture Moses threw that stick
[1:09:43] down for the first time it turned to
[1:09:45] snake he took off running from it
[1:09:47] Moses took off running which you know I
[1:09:50] have to say there's an element of of
[1:09:52] what what Moses had in him is also
[1:09:55] inside of me because if if I would have
[1:09:58] took a stick and it threw it down and it
[1:10:01] turned into a snake I would have run
[1:10:03] yeah
[1:10:04] that's me I would have just took off
[1:10:06] running and then here's what God does in
[1:10:09] order to take the fear out of Moses
[1:10:12] sir I want you yeah to reach down pick
[1:10:17] that snake up by the tail not knowing
[1:10:20] what was gonna happen and then his mind
[1:10:23] he's thinking pick it up by the tail
[1:10:25] where his head could hit me I mean
[1:10:31] it takes faith
[1:10:33] to believe God right I mean it takes
[1:10:36] Faith to go against your own uh your own
[1:10:39] belief system why would I do something
[1:10:42] like that
[1:10:43] Moses reaches down by faith and he had
[1:10:46] to get rid of the fear and I could there
[1:10:48] is nobody there I can see the snake just
[1:10:50] looking at Moses
[1:10:55] and Moses maybe like is there anybody
[1:10:58] here that can pick this thing nobody
[1:11:00] just move I mean I mean he's here by
[1:11:02] himself
[1:11:04] pick them up
[1:11:06] I told you to throw them down now you
[1:11:07] pick them up
[1:11:13] turns back into the sticky like oh my
[1:11:16] God okay I'm ready to go to this I'm
[1:11:17] going to go to Egypt now I'm ready to go
[1:11:19] and he gets to Egypt at the supernatural
[1:11:21] experience it takes his stick and say oh
[1:11:23] yeah you want to see something Pharaoh
[1:11:25] God is with me throws it down again turn
[1:11:28] into a snake and then he hears the
[1:11:30] Pharaohs say that's a cheap magician
[1:11:32] trick
[1:11:35] my question is what were they practicing
[1:11:38] in Egypt
[1:11:41] what were they practicing in Egypt
[1:11:43] that this man could call it a cheat
[1:11:45] magician trick but what Moses did he got
[1:11:48] there and he saw you know what Janice
[1:11:50] and Jammers can do that they throw it
[1:11:51] out they got two stinks now Moses what
[1:11:53] you got
[1:11:54] Moses had to stand in patience
[1:11:57] because he knew he did exactly what God
[1:12:00] told him to do
[1:12:01] so now I'm just going to stay here and
[1:12:02] I'm gonna just let God do what he gonna
[1:12:03] do and before you know it Moses snakes
[1:12:06] starts swallowing the other snakes
[1:12:08] and then Moses knew
[1:12:13] is reach down pick it up again it's
[1:12:14] gonna go back to Iraq
[1:12:17] and now where's Janice and Jamboree
[1:12:19] snakes
[1:12:20] in my ride
[1:12:24] I can bind their snakes
[1:12:27] and if I throw it down I can lose their
[1:12:28] snakes
[1:12:30] Oh Glory to God
[1:12:33] Moses had to wait in patience here you
[1:12:37] know brother Branham says it in Statue
[1:12:39] of a perfect man it says why he he said
[1:12:41] that that cheap magician trick come here
[1:12:43] a minute come here Janice and jam Bridge
[1:12:45] throw your sticks down they throw them
[1:12:47] down and they turn into a serpent
[1:12:50] said now you cheap thing come down here
[1:12:53] to me an Egyptian of pharaoh Egypt and
[1:12:55] you come down here with some some of
[1:12:57] your cheat magician tricks some of your
[1:12:59] hoax you know mind reading you know what
[1:13:02] I mean I hope I hope you're reading
[1:13:03] about it mental telepathy
[1:13:06] um or or something you see here come
[1:13:08] down over here some of that said well we
[1:13:10] can do the same thing you do what was
[1:13:13] Moses he didn't say Oh Mr Pharaoh I'm
[1:13:15] sorry sir
[1:13:17] I'll be your slave no sir he stood still
[1:13:21] and I believe y'all got that sign right
[1:13:24] there right in front of you say be still
[1:13:26] and know that I am God no he stood still
[1:13:29] stayed right there God said just no
[1:13:33] doubt in his heart hold your peace I'll
[1:13:38] show you something when you've done
[1:13:41] exactly what he he said do seems like it
[1:13:45] went wrong
[1:13:47] stand still be patient
[1:13:52] oh we can be encouraged with the word of
[1:13:54] God
[1:13:55] stand still and be patient
[1:13:57] here you know the the prophet used the
[1:14:00] Hebrew boys they have patience to wait
[1:14:02] on God and we all know the story there
[1:14:04] and Daniel the Lion's Den had patience
[1:14:06] to wait on God uh but he also picked up
[1:14:10] Paul and said Paul was patient
[1:14:13] oh my let's look at this he says sir
[1:14:15] look at what Paul had to do talk about
[1:14:17] patience now let's look at Paul for a
[1:14:18] little bit amen I'm picking up Acts 23
[1:14:22] and verse 11
[1:14:24] . uh it says this and the night
[1:14:27] following the Lord stood by him and said
[1:14:29] be of good cheer Paul for thou has
[1:14:31] testified of me in Jerusalem so must
[1:14:34] thou bear witness also at Rome
[1:14:37] so now Paul has a promise here that he
[1:14:40] has to go to Rome and that's all he has
[1:14:43] is a promise but before he gets to Rome
[1:14:45] there are a number of things that
[1:14:47] happens in Paul's life now I want to
[1:14:50] just pick up this uh it says the Bible
[1:14:52] states that there were several Jews who
[1:14:54] uh were who banned it that they would
[1:14:56] kill him amen we find that uh in the
[1:15:00] book of Acts also in Acts 24 he was
[1:15:02] taken to Felix uh who prolonged his
[1:15:05] judgment for two years and hope that
[1:15:07] Paul would give him money to buy his
[1:15:09] freedom right here's some other things
[1:15:11] that Paul went through in Acts 25 he
[1:15:13] stood before Festus who replaced Felix
[1:15:16] and appealed to Stan before Caesar uh
[1:15:18] but remember the prophecy now amen
[1:15:21] because the prophet says You must bear
[1:15:22] witness of me at Rome so in Acts 25 he
[1:15:26] appeals and says I want to stand before
[1:15:27] Caesar amen and uh uh the prophet is
[1:15:30] that and since he was going to Bear
[1:15:32] witness in Rome this was a way for him
[1:15:34] to get to Rome right he also had to
[1:15:36] stand before King Agrippa and he began
[1:15:39] to give his personal testimony of his
[1:15:42] conversion and I and I got a little note
[1:15:45] I said I like how Paul did this with
[1:15:47] Agrippa he began to give his personal
[1:15:49] testimony of his conversion what
[1:15:51] happened to him on the road to Damascus
[1:15:53] right he began that personal testimony
[1:15:55] and um and I like it because when he
[1:15:58] stood before Agrippa Paul did not try to
[1:16:01] break into all the Mysteries
[1:16:03] hey man it wasn't the Mysteries that
[1:16:07] actually impacted Agrippa amen it was
[1:16:11] the the greatest mystery that you could
[1:16:13] ever break into is the mystery of your
[1:16:16] conversion
[1:16:18] Hallelujah you talking about a mystery
[1:16:20] how did you end up here how did you come
[1:16:23] to the message how did you come to Jesus
[1:16:26] Christ that is a mystery how did God do
[1:16:29] that in your life
[1:16:31] share that mystery with people
[1:16:34] hallelujah amen as Paul began to share
[1:16:37] just the mystery of his conversion
[1:16:40] I mean they knew what they knew this guy
[1:16:42] they knew I mean used to uh uh run
[1:16:44] Christians down to kill them he was
[1:16:46] doing all kind of how did you come to
[1:16:48] walk in this way Paul what happened to
[1:16:51] you he began to share his own personal
[1:16:53] testimony and that mystery alone began
[1:16:56] to cause her gripper to say you almost
[1:16:58] persuade me
[1:17:00] you almost persuade me I I think I might
[1:17:04] want to do this
[1:17:06] Hallelujah in Acts 27 now Paul got the
[1:17:10] uh the promising acts 23 that he was
[1:17:13] gonna go to Rome but now we find him
[1:17:15] going just walking right through the
[1:17:17] scriptures acts 27 he finally set sail
[1:17:20] for Rome
[1:17:21] and when it sets out for Rome they got
[1:17:24] hit with a tempestuous Wind Called
[1:17:26] euroclidon yeah and and and and and and
[1:17:28] and and we see these all the time in
[1:17:30] Florida they're hurricanes that's what
[1:17:33] this was your client was simply a named
[1:17:36] hurricane
[1:17:37] we have them all the time in Florida
[1:17:39] man most people say how could you live
[1:17:40] in something like that I don't know I
[1:17:43] say the same thing when I come up north
[1:17:45] and feel the cold weather high could you
[1:17:46] live in something like that
[1:17:49] that is
[1:17:50] when they got hit but you're a clad on
[1:17:53] there stuck on the ship and the ship is
[1:17:55] actually uh falling apart all around
[1:17:57] them and uh he was promised though while
[1:18:00] he was in the middle of the storm he was
[1:18:02] promised that anybody that is with you
[1:18:05] will be spared
[1:18:07] Hallelujah they were not allowed even
[1:18:09] though they were there was some ready to
[1:18:11] jump off the ship and get into some
[1:18:13] smaller boats to try to get the safety
[1:18:15] it says no anybody that is with me will
[1:18:18] be spared you can't get out the boat
[1:18:20] when the storm comes
[1:18:22] I'm gonna say that again you cannot get
[1:18:24] out the bed when the storm comes what
[1:18:27] you have to do is just be patient
[1:18:30] glory to God Amen say they were they
[1:18:33] were not allowed to get out of the boat
[1:18:35] if they were going to survive once the
[1:18:37] ship became stuck the soldiers were
[1:18:39] designed to kill some of the prisoners
[1:18:41] unless they escape but because Paul was
[1:18:44] on board and even though he was a
[1:18:46] prisoner the Centurion refused the
[1:18:49] request of the soldiers to kill some of
[1:18:51] the prisoners
[1:18:52] Hallelujah some had to swim to land
[1:18:55] others that could not swim just grabbed
[1:18:58] the floating piece of wood in order to
[1:19:01] get to safety and I want to just give
[1:19:03] you an encouragement if you're floating
[1:19:05] on a just a broken piece of the ship you
[1:19:09] can make it on broken pieces
[1:19:12] hey you can make it on drunken pieces
[1:19:17] to God
[1:19:19] amen you're and I want to tell you
[1:19:21] another thing you are still in the
[1:19:24] perfect will of God when you are
[1:19:26] enduring Euro climb on
[1:19:30] because we go through a trial like that
[1:19:32] we feel like God has left us but know
[1:19:34] when you're in the middle of your Clyde
[1:19:36] and you're still in the midst of the
[1:19:38] will of God the perfect will of God
[1:19:39] because God told Paul that he must bear
[1:19:43] witness in Rome he didn't tell him
[1:19:45] everything he was going to have to go
[1:19:47] through before he got to Rome
[1:19:49] all right
[1:19:51] but he was still patient just waiting on
[1:19:53] God and once they made it to safety
[1:19:57] he got bit by a snake
[1:20:01] and here's the thing you might get bit
[1:20:02] by a snake
[1:20:04] sometimes people can be snakes
[1:20:07] but you got to learn to just do what
[1:20:09] Paul did
[1:20:12] just Shake It Off
[1:20:17] remember you're still in the perfect
[1:20:18] will of God
[1:20:19] even in the middle of your Clyde right
[1:20:24] brother Branham said when you've done
[1:20:26] exactly what he said do seems like it
[1:20:29] went wrong
[1:20:30] stand still
[1:20:32] be patient
[1:20:36] he remained patient in all of this as he
[1:20:39] was promised that he would bear witness
[1:20:40] also at Rome
[1:20:42] and we see Paul where the brother
[1:20:43] Randall say you talk about patient Paul
[1:20:45] went through a lot and he remained
[1:20:47] patient with God
[1:20:50] Hallelujah
[1:20:52] um here the last one he uses is the
[1:20:55] Pentecostals
[1:20:56] Pentecost Believers had to wait
[1:20:58] until they were in due with power from
[1:21:00] the high they had to be patient waiting
[1:21:02] on god let's pick up a scripture out of
[1:21:04] Hebrews 10.
[1:21:06] verse 35 cast not a way therefore your
[1:21:09] confidence
[1:21:11] which hath great recompense of reward
[1:21:14] for ye have need of patience
[1:21:17] that after ye have done the will of God
[1:21:21] you might receive the promise
[1:21:23] for yet a little while and he that shall
[1:21:26] come will come and will not Tarry
[1:21:29] now the just shall live by faith but if
[1:21:32] any man draw back my soul shall have no
[1:21:34] pleasure in him
[1:21:36] brother random gives a little testimony
[1:21:38] of a sister here let's look at this in
[1:21:40] the Hours come it says recently
[1:21:42] she has sent one of those handkerchief's
[1:21:45] her sister for her little baby
[1:21:47] that had a club foot
[1:21:49] and she told the lady she said you tie
[1:21:51] the handkerchief on its foot and the
[1:21:54] Lord is going to heal it
[1:21:55] so she left the handkerchief on about
[1:21:58] two weeks and it got so dirty
[1:22:01] and she said you can wash it and then
[1:22:03] and then put it back on so she did in
[1:22:06] the handkerchief got uh getting kind of
[1:22:08] old and worn she said well there's no
[1:22:11] difference in the baby's foot so I guess
[1:22:13] I might as well take it off
[1:22:15] she said oh don't you do that say if it
[1:22:18] comes to pieces
[1:22:20] you tie it with strings then tie it back
[1:22:23] on there and it said because I accept
[1:22:26] because I know that it will get well
[1:22:28] she's seeing so many things done in the
[1:22:31] meetings and uh and the woman did that
[1:22:35] she just had a few strings of that
[1:22:37] handkerchief uh tied on the baby's foot
[1:22:39] and one morning she went to get the baby
[1:22:43] and the Lord had been there that night
[1:22:48] and the baby's foot was straight
[1:22:50] and she brought the baby to the meeting
[1:22:53] to show and brought the strings that was
[1:22:56] left on the handkerchief and had the
[1:22:58] baby's picture before and where it was
[1:22:59] then how the little baby's foot uh was
[1:23:02] clubbed in like that a little baby about
[1:23:04] eight or ten months old and there was
[1:23:07] the little baby split just as normal as
[1:23:09] any other baby now what if she just
[1:23:12] throw the handkerchief away and say well
[1:23:15] that's where we missed the blessings
[1:23:19] says we're free to wait on God just a
[1:23:25] little bit right see you've heard that
[1:23:27] only wait again I I hear that whisper
[1:23:29] only wait it won't be very long even now
[1:23:33] the father's hand is pleading soon with
[1:23:35] Jesus uh we will sing the victory song
[1:23:38] that's right just wait on God believe it
[1:23:41] confess it stay with it and God will
[1:23:43] bring it to pass for you I want to say
[1:23:46] it again believe it confess it stay with
[1:23:48] it and God will bring it to pass for you
[1:23:53] glory to God
[1:23:58] the prophet goes on in the Statue of a
[1:24:00] perfect man it says now if you got that
[1:24:01] kind of patience
[1:24:03] after God gives you a promise
[1:24:06] and you see it in the Bible
[1:24:09] it's mine
[1:24:10] he says then wait
[1:24:13] once you see it in the Bible and realize
[1:24:15] after you see the Promise that's when
[1:24:17] the trial actually happens
[1:24:19] it's not not the answer happens no the
[1:24:21] trial happens the trial happens when you
[1:24:23] see it you get inspiration from the
[1:24:25] scripture God gave me this promises and
[1:24:27] I was just listening to tape recently
[1:24:28] unchangeable god brother random say even
[1:24:30] no matter what promise it is in the
[1:24:32] Bible even in the Old Testament if you
[1:24:34] see something that God wrote even to the
[1:24:36] children of Israel take it personally to
[1:24:38] yourself
[1:24:39] make it personal to you and say stand on
[1:24:42] that it becomes your personal property
[1:24:44] even though it's written to somebody
[1:24:46] else I read it so I'm taking it as mine
[1:24:50] I'll tell you another thing that I've
[1:24:52] taken as mine
[1:24:54] everything that I ever love yeah
[1:24:56] yeah and everything that ever loved me I
[1:24:59] would see them on the other side
[1:25:02] Hallelujah I believe the prophets shared
[1:25:05] that for a reason to encourage us
[1:25:08] sometimes we worry a little bit about
[1:25:11] too many things but everything we love
[1:25:13] and everything never loved us we'll see
[1:25:14] on the other side
[1:25:15] how's it going to happen I cannot
[1:25:17] explain that part
[1:25:19] but I believe God
[1:25:24] amen he says this um
[1:25:28] you're getting
[1:25:30] he said he says then you got that kind
[1:25:32] of patience added to your faith and see
[1:25:35] how high you're getting now you're
[1:25:36] getting way up here now all right the
[1:25:38] clock hand is getting uh getting way
[1:25:40] around too isn't it all right all right
[1:25:42] add this to your faith
[1:25:44] all right
[1:25:45] it says always putting him before you're
[1:25:47] remembering it was it was
[1:25:49] it was he that promised wasn't me
[1:25:51] promised wasn't Pastor promise or
[1:25:53] brother Neville it wasn't some other
[1:25:55] minister promised it it wasn't some
[1:25:57] priest of Pope it wasn't no man of the
[1:25:59] earth it was God made the promise and
[1:26:01] God is able to keep everything he
[1:26:03] promised all right if you got that kind
[1:26:06] of Faith to know
[1:26:08] that God promised it say brother Brandon
[1:26:10] I'm sick I need a healing awful bad
[1:26:12] accepted it's a gift given to you yes
[1:26:15] sir thou cast believe well you you say I
[1:26:17] do believe then forget it
[1:26:19] if you believe then forget it that's all
[1:26:23] it's all over see have patience if you
[1:26:25] got patience if you're not if you're not
[1:26:27] you're crumbling off of this building
[1:26:29] here see It'll knock all the rest of it
[1:26:32] down the one that one thing God gotta
[1:26:35] have that don't add it because uh that
[1:26:37] that but he says don't add it because
[1:26:40] it'll wreck your building if you haven't
[1:26:41] got patience if you hadn't got virtue to
[1:26:44] add to your faith that you that you say
[1:26:46] you got and if you haven't got any faith
[1:26:48] and try to put virtue on it it'll break
[1:26:50] your faith down see you say well wait a
[1:26:52] minute maybe this is that that's all a
[1:26:54] mistake anyhow maybe God isn't God maybe
[1:26:56] there is no God See it'll break the
[1:26:58] thing right into
[1:27:00] but even when you're going no matter
[1:27:03] what you're going through even Euro
[1:27:04] Clyde on you're still in the will of God
[1:27:06] right so just be patient and wait Paul
[1:27:09] had to be patient and wait to get to
[1:27:11] Rome no no snake bite could stop him no
[1:27:14] Euro clydon can stop him because God
[1:27:16] told him he was going to Rome no change
[1:27:19] in government could stop him nothing
[1:27:21] could stop Paul from getting to Rome
[1:27:24] nothing's gonna stop you from getting to
[1:27:26] your destination
[1:27:27] [Music]
[1:27:29] I have to move forward I'm running out
[1:27:30] of time
[1:27:32] I'm running out of time I tell you Lord
[1:27:34] Jesus let's get back over here to this
[1:27:37] war strategy
[1:27:40] oh my
[1:27:42] let me um
[1:27:48] I gotta skip some things just bear with
[1:27:51] me huh
[1:27:55] there's a scripture that I wanted to
[1:27:57] read out of second Samuel five and I'll
[1:27:58] just read that really quick it's in my
[1:28:00] notes
[1:28:01] um
[1:28:04] one time in battle
[1:28:06] David had to display this
[1:28:10] this patience when he went in battle
[1:28:13] and um
[1:28:15] oftentimes we go to things and I want to
[1:28:17] show this reason I say war strategies
[1:28:19] because oftentimes we look at God doing
[1:28:21] something one way
[1:28:23] and that he's going to do it that way
[1:28:24] all the time
[1:28:25] actually brother Brandon said we make an
[1:28:27] idol out of God when we do that right we
[1:28:30] actually have to allow God to be God and
[1:28:33] whatever way he desires to work that's
[1:28:35] the way we want him to work so there's
[1:28:37] different ways that he he strategizes
[1:28:40] there's different things that he will
[1:28:41] tell you to do at different seasons of
[1:28:43] your life and it's still the same God
[1:28:45] providing you to victory and uh when we
[1:28:47] look back and some of the things David
[1:28:49] was in one battle and God told him to do
[1:28:50] it one way but now he gets to another
[1:28:52] battle no no no I want you to wait now
[1:28:54] and we picked this up in in second
[1:28:56] Samuel 5 verse 19 it says and David
[1:28:59] inquired of the Lord saying shall I go
[1:29:01] up to the Philistines without delivering
[1:29:04] them into my hand and the Lord said on
[1:29:06] the day that go up for I will doubtless
[1:29:08] deliver the Philistines into thine hand
[1:29:10] and David came to about Paris them and
[1:29:14] David smoke smote them there and said
[1:29:17] the Lord
[1:29:19] it says the Lord had broken forth upon
[1:29:21] my energy for me as the breach of waters
[1:29:24] therefore he called the name of that
[1:29:25] place Val perazim now uh I just looked
[1:29:28] at this in the Hebrew lexicon that word
[1:29:30] Bal parazim means the lord of the breaks
[1:29:34] it means lord of the breaks right and
[1:29:37] it's it's the it's the sight of victory
[1:29:39] over of David over the Philistines and
[1:29:41] of a great destruction of the image
[1:29:43] called uh Mount parazim so but but when
[1:29:46] when you come to a place called Bal
[1:29:47] perazim is Lord of the breaks and I want
[1:29:50] to tell you something whenever you get
[1:29:51] into a spot like that there's one or two
[1:29:54] breaks that you can have the first is a
[1:29:56] breakthrough
[1:29:57] if you're waiting on the Lord at a place
[1:29:59] like valpirism you can have you can
[1:30:01] experience a breakthrough but if your
[1:30:03] patience is not at the level it needs to
[1:30:05] be you can also experience a breakdown
[1:30:09] but he's the lord of the bricks he wants
[1:30:12] to give you the Breakthrough
[1:30:14] verse 21 says and there they let their
[1:30:17] image images and David and his men
[1:30:19] burned them and the Philistines came up
[1:30:22] yet again and spread themselves in the
[1:30:24] Valley now watch this the valley of
[1:30:25] reframe now first he says go up go up
[1:30:28] you know he inquires the Lord said he
[1:30:29] says he says go up but now in verse 23
[1:30:31] the strategy changes and when the date
[1:30:35] when David inquire the Lord he said Thou
[1:30:37] shalt not go up but fetch a compass
[1:30:40] behind them and come upon them over
[1:30:43] against the Mulberry Chase
[1:30:46] Hallelujah and let it be when thou here
[1:30:48] is the sound
[1:30:50] now he had to sit there under their
[1:30:52] mulberry trees until he heard that sound
[1:30:54] and when thou he because uh he says with
[1:30:57] now here's the sound of the going and
[1:30:59] the tops of the mulberry trees then that
[1:31:02] then thou shall be stir thyself but then
[1:31:04] shall the Lord go out before thee this
[1:31:06] night the host of the Philistines and
[1:31:08] David
[1:31:09] did so as the Lord had commanded him
[1:31:12] and smote the Philistines from giba
[1:31:14] until Thou come to gazer right there in
[1:31:18] uh those few verses we see two different
[1:31:21] strategies that God gives David the
[1:31:24] second strategy required patience sit
[1:31:27] there underneath the mulberry tree and
[1:31:29] wait to hear the sound in the top of the
[1:31:31] Mulberry Tree then you know God has gone
[1:31:34] before you and the Philistines have been
[1:31:35] given to you but you have to wait don't
[1:31:38] get ahead of God
[1:31:40] don't jump out there wait David I'm
[1:31:43] giving you a strategy this is how you're
[1:31:45] going to overcome in this battle we
[1:31:47] ought to seek God Amen when we're going
[1:31:49] through different trials and I don't
[1:31:50] like seek God let him give you the
[1:31:52] strategy how do you know one of these
[1:31:54] virtues has not been tested in you
[1:31:57] because God is the one that sends the
[1:31:59] test the prophet told us he drives them
[1:32:02] God drives them so don't get in a hurry
[1:32:05] don't get in the don't get ahead of God
[1:32:07] just wait
[1:32:11] we see this
[1:32:13] in Joshua I'm I'm just I'm skipping I
[1:32:17] have to
[1:32:18] for the sake of time we see this in
[1:32:21] Joshua
[1:32:23] when we picked up amen there in Joshua
[1:32:26] chapter
[1:32:28] um
[1:32:28] five we'll go back and just read that
[1:32:30] really quick Joshua 5 13
[1:32:34] says it came to pass when Joshua was by
[1:32:38] Jericho
[1:32:39] that he lifted up his eyes and looked
[1:32:41] and behold there stood a man over
[1:32:43] against him with his sword drawn in his
[1:32:46] hand
[1:32:47] Joshua went unto him and said unto him
[1:32:49] art thou forest or for our adversaries
[1:32:53] and he said nay but as captain of the
[1:32:55] host of the Lord am I now come and we
[1:32:58] know the captain of the host is none
[1:32:59] other than the Lord Jesus himself
[1:33:02] all right it says that I am come and
[1:33:04] Joshua fell on his face to the Earth and
[1:33:07] did worship and said unto him what saith
[1:33:11] my Lord unto his servants now unto his
[1:33:14] servant I want you to get just in that
[1:33:16] little statement
[1:33:17] when he says what saith my Lord unto his
[1:33:20] servant don't we want we don't want to
[1:33:22] be too quick to go into the next verse
[1:33:24] but brother Branham actually tells us
[1:33:26] Joshua was receiving a strategy
[1:33:29] at this moment when it when he's when it
[1:33:32] says what saith of my Lord unto his
[1:33:35] servant God was actually he was giving
[1:33:37] him a strategy of what to do in Jericho
[1:33:40] this is how Joshua knew what to do when
[1:33:43] we get to uh chapter six this is how he
[1:33:45] knew what to do because he was he
[1:33:47] received the strategy right here but in
[1:33:50] this strategy in order to overcome
[1:33:52] Jericho it was going to require patience
[1:33:57] but in your patience you possess right
[1:34:00] so so he had required some patience but
[1:34:03] this right here is where he got the
[1:34:05] strategy now the next verse tells us and
[1:34:08] the captain of the Lord's whole set in
[1:34:10] the Joshua that shoe
[1:34:12] from off that foot
[1:34:14] so the place where on thou standards is
[1:34:16] is Holy and Joshua did so I like that
[1:34:20] and because uh I'm sure Joshua heard
[1:34:24] Moses testimonies of of how he got to
[1:34:27] the burning bush and you know and he was
[1:34:29] told to take off his shoes and he was
[1:34:31] standing the Holy Ground and and all the
[1:34:33] great things I just saw I saw this great
[1:34:36] light in the burning bush but when
[1:34:38] Joshua hears this testimony amen of the
[1:34:41] same thing Moses heard to take off his
[1:34:43] shoes he he was no longer standing in
[1:34:45] the presence of a great light but that
[1:34:47] light had become a person
[1:34:50] the light had become a man and Joshua
[1:34:53] saw a man the captain of the Lord's
[1:34:55] House standing in his presence giving
[1:34:57] him the same command that he gave Moses
[1:35:01] I can just tell you like this in every
[1:35:03] generation the manifestation gets great
[1:35:05] time
[1:35:05] [Applause]
[1:35:09] Hallelujah
[1:35:11] I'm expecting greater manifestation
[1:35:13] I I I I I I I want to just you know this
[1:35:18] this strategy that he gives Joshua
[1:35:20] at this time he tells him says Joshua
[1:35:24] I want you to go up
[1:35:27] and tell the people
[1:35:29] that they're going to March around
[1:35:30] Jericho one time for six days they're
[1:35:33] gonna March around one time around these
[1:35:35] walls of Jericho and we gotta understand
[1:35:37] these walls are massive walls they were
[1:35:40] they were so so big that you could have
[1:35:42] chariot races on the wall
[1:35:45] Hallelujah glory to God and and and and
[1:35:48] and and and and
[1:35:49] Joshua's strategy just tell the people
[1:35:51] say now just go March around the walls
[1:35:53] just one time for the first six days I
[1:35:56] said but now when you get to the seventh
[1:35:57] day I want you to March around the walls
[1:35:59] seven times on the seventh day this
[1:36:02] required patience
[1:36:04] and now after we get to the seventh day
[1:36:06] and after we March around the wall seven
[1:36:08] times then what I want you to do is have
[1:36:10] the the uh the trumpet just blow their
[1:36:12] trumpets and it says and after that I
[1:36:14] want you to tell the people that they
[1:36:16] can shout now while they're walking
[1:36:17] around the first the first uh six days
[1:36:19] no talking at all and when they go
[1:36:22] around seven times on the seventh day no
[1:36:24] talking at all hallelujah amen and can
[1:36:28] you imagine maybe somebody wanting to
[1:36:30] say something like no don't say a word
[1:36:33] don't nobody says anything only when I
[1:36:36] bid you shout right is when you can
[1:36:39] shout and they walked around that first
[1:36:42] day
[1:36:43] maybe the people were tired like oh my
[1:36:45] this was this was a major task and you
[1:36:49] want us to do this six days
[1:36:51] not only that but on the seventh day
[1:36:55] seven times
[1:36:57] that's what God Said
[1:36:59] they marched around the first time for
[1:37:01] second day Third Day fourth day mom
[1:37:04] maybe they were wore out but how somehow
[1:37:06] God gives them Supernatural stem because
[1:37:08] people know that the promises at hand
[1:37:10] and on that seventh day they get enough
[1:37:12] strength to go around seven times
[1:37:15] now and they all wore out and tired come
[1:37:19] to the end of the battle he says now
[1:37:21] tell them to blow the trumpet and say
[1:37:23] now now can you imagine I want you to
[1:37:25] get to see mine they were wore out they
[1:37:29] were beat down the sun all over maybe a
[1:37:32] hot Florida sun in the middle of the
[1:37:34] desert somewhere I mean they I mean they
[1:37:36] wore out
[1:37:38] Hallelujah I want to tell you sometimes
[1:37:42] God asks for your best praise
[1:37:45] when you're wore out when when the trial
[1:37:49] has been so great you can't even bear
[1:37:52] anymore
[1:37:53] but this is when God asks you to give
[1:37:55] you your best shouts your
[1:37:58] yes when you're going through you're
[1:38:00] worse that's when they ask for your best
[1:38:05] they get around and say now you want us
[1:38:08] to do what
[1:38:09] when they blow this trumpet
[1:38:12] I want you to give the best Praise You
[1:38:14] Got
[1:38:16] no weapons
[1:38:19] no no Cannon
[1:38:21] no sword no spear no bombs
[1:38:26] praise
[1:38:30] your strategy is give God praise that
[1:38:35] that's what I want you to do in the
[1:38:37] midst of just give me praise you've been
[1:38:39] patient you've been waiting on me I'm
[1:38:41] gonna take this wall down you don't have
[1:38:43] to worry about it let me be God
[1:38:46] amen they blew the trumpets and when
[1:38:49] they blew that trouble said Joshua said
[1:38:51] now it's time to let out that Shout
[1:38:54] and brother the people begin to praise
[1:38:56] God they begin to worship and and before
[1:39:00] you knew it they saw the walls just
[1:39:01] coming down yeah
[1:39:03] now the walls had to fall
[1:39:05] in a very specific way yeah
[1:39:09] because there was one house on the wall
[1:39:12] that could not come down
[1:39:15] and it was the house of rehab
[1:39:17] her house was still standing and she had
[1:39:19] that Scarlet thread out the window
[1:39:21] because she believed what the messengers
[1:39:23] has said so God had to preserved her
[1:39:26] house while the rest of the Wall came
[1:39:28] down
[1:39:30] you talk about a victory
[1:39:33] but the people had to be patient and
[1:39:36] waiting on God to Manifest this great
[1:39:39] victory
[1:39:41] here brother Branham makes a statement
[1:39:43] in the sermon
[1:39:47] if God be with us then where's all the
[1:39:50] Miracles
[1:39:55] Joshua oh the Great
[1:39:58] conqueror oh the successor of Moses a
[1:40:01] man that God loved the mighty warrior
[1:40:03] man that God loved God told him as I was
[1:40:06] with Moses
[1:40:08] so will I be with you
[1:40:11] but before the walls fell Joshua marched
[1:40:13] according to the according to the
[1:40:15] chief's Captain's orders
[1:40:18] so when did he receive the orders back
[1:40:19] there when it says you know uh uh what
[1:40:22] saith my Lord unto
[1:40:23] your servant that's when he received the
[1:40:26] orders
[1:40:28] Joshua marched according to the chief
[1:40:29] Captain's orders around the wall 13
[1:40:32] times before the power of God ever
[1:40:34] struck the thing
[1:40:36] he marched around the wall and sounded
[1:40:38] the trumpet according to the word of God
[1:40:41] that the chief Captain told him out
[1:40:43] there when he met him he marched
[1:40:46] according to the word of God what did he
[1:40:48] do he acted upon the word before he saw
[1:40:52] the miracle
[1:40:55] we all have to do that we have to act
[1:40:57] upon the word before we see the miracle
[1:41:03] you know just to sound a trumpet don't
[1:41:06] shake down a wall
[1:41:08] that you can run chariot races around
[1:41:10] sounding a trumpet but God said just
[1:41:12] March around the wall seven times in the
[1:41:16] last day March uh March uh March 7th and
[1:41:19] 13 times as you go around the wall at
[1:41:22] the last time let the priest go before
[1:41:24] the ark and sound the trumpet and when
[1:41:26] the trumpet sounds the walls will shake
[1:41:28] down what they do he saw the miracle of
[1:41:32] God after he acted on the word of God
[1:41:34] where is your miracle act on his word
[1:41:37] first
[1:41:39] how could the walls be shook down and
[1:41:42] leave one little house standing
[1:41:44] a Harless house
[1:41:46] because she acted on the word of God why
[1:41:49] did the rest of them die and she lived
[1:41:52] she acted on the word of God she saw the
[1:41:56] miracle of God that's the way to find it
[1:41:59] act on the word
[1:42:05] Hallelujah
[1:42:10] brother banham goes on to say this in
[1:42:11] the message Resurrection
[1:42:13] he preaches this in West Palm Beach
[1:42:19] now I believe I told you the truth or an
[1:42:22] error
[1:42:23] I have the Bible here to back up
[1:42:28] uh back up tell me I told I told the
[1:42:30] truth the holy spirit's here I believe
[1:42:32] that if each one of you will be sincere
[1:42:35] in your heart now
[1:42:38] you would get just what you actually
[1:42:42] now when Joshua crossed the river Jordan
[1:42:44] they marched around Jericho and
[1:42:47] and then they let out a shout
[1:42:50] the walls of Jericho fell
[1:42:52] they went in and took the city
[1:42:57] all want this afternoon you want healing
[1:43:01] let's go in and take it
[1:43:04] if you want healing it's yours
[1:43:07] God promised it to you
[1:43:09] it's yours if you want salvation it's
[1:43:12] yours
[1:43:13] but let's go in and take it
[1:43:17] they were patient they were waiting
[1:43:20] they did exactly what God told them to
[1:43:22] do and remember the trial comes after
[1:43:24] you received the promise
[1:43:26] but if you hold on to what God told you
[1:43:28] because he's developing your patience in
[1:43:30] the midst of that if you hold on to what
[1:43:32] God has promised you God's word cannot
[1:43:35] and will not fail amen the most solid
[1:43:39] thing you have in your possession
[1:43:40] is the word of God
[1:43:44] I encourage you just be patient
[1:43:47] wait on God he'll use a strategy he'll
[1:43:50] give you something to overcome the enemy
[1:43:52] with but follow follow his word follow
[1:43:54] his strategy
[1:43:55] you'll rise in Victory
