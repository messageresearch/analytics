[27:35] the resources to clear and and all of
[27:38] that we had the tent up um over there in

[28:00] our bibles to the book of said look
[28:02] let me just write to god we would say
[28:04] something here amen
[28:07] certainly haven't got a lot to say that
[28:09] you have never heard before amen praise
[28:11] god but you know to each
[28:14] god has given
[28:16] a portion
[28:18] amen certainly and um it's hard for us
[28:20] to ever think in our little corner that
[28:22] we've got you know all that we have need
[28:25] of
[28:26] for god has given us a fight for
[28:27] ministry
[28:29] to bring forth his word
[28:31] amen i'd like to read from
[28:34] luke chapter four let me read from verse
[28:37] 14.
[28:46] and it says that jesus returning in the
[28:48] power of the spirit into galilee and
[28:51] they went out of fame of him through all
[28:54] the regions wrote about
[28:55] and he taught in their synagogue been
[28:58] glorified of all
[29:00] and he came to nazareth where he had
[29:02] been brought up and as his custom was he
[29:05] went into the synagogue on the sabbath
[29:07] day and stood up for to read
[29:10] and there was delivered unto him
[29:13] the book of the prophet azza
[29:15] and when he had opened the book he found
[29:18] the place where it was written
[29:20] the spirit of the lord is upon me for he
[29:23] has anointed me to preach the gospel to
[29:25] the poor
[29:26] he has sent me to heal the broken heart
[29:29] and to preach deliverance to the
[29:30] captives and to the recov and recovering
[29:34] of the sight of the blind and to set at
[29:36] liberty them that are bruised to preach
[29:39] the acceptable year of the lord and he
[29:42] closed the book
[29:44] and he gave it again unto the minister
[29:46] and sat down
[29:48] and the eyes of all them that were in
[29:50] the synagogue were fastened on him and
[29:53] he begin to say unto them
[29:55] this day is the scripture fulfilled in
[29:58] your years
[29:59] and all bear him witness and wondered
[30:02] are the gracious words which proceed out
[30:05] of his mouth and they said is not this
[30:08] joseph son
[30:10] may the lord that is blessing to the
[30:11] world maybe just by heads everywhere
[30:15] almighty god and our father lord for
[30:18] many times and in many
[30:20] season oh god
[30:21] these scriptures have been read like it
[30:23] was read back that day
[30:25] and oh father many things have been said
[30:27] on the word and lord as a light has
[30:30] shown god but father we pray the sibling
[30:32] lord just one more time would you take
[30:34] our bodies or lips and they hear that
[30:36] hero god and lord god may you be
[30:38] glorified by your own word heavenly
[30:41] father we pray that your anointing of
[30:43] the holy spirit oh god will come in our
[30:45] midst and lord god not just the
[30:47] anointing but truth or god may proceed
[30:50] out of our mouth as it proceed when he
[30:53] met the word that was on the paper
[30:55] becomes alive that day just bless us now
[30:58] as we look to you believing in jesus
[31:00] name we pray amen amen you may be seated
[31:06] i'd like to say speak this evening on
[31:10] the measuring stick of truth
[31:14] you know when jesus was before pilot
[31:16] pilot asks a question
[31:18] what is truth
[31:21] uh
[31:22] i say many times that
[31:24] you know we might look at truth as
[31:26] a concept
[31:28] something to be uh
[31:31] looked into
[31:32] or you know it is something that a word
[31:35] that we could find its meaning and
[31:37] explain and expound on it really well
[31:40] jesus one time he said i am the truth
[31:44] hallelujah and so we look at truth not
[31:46] just amen as a concept but truth as a
[31:51] person
[31:52] amen
[31:54] you know as we look at this in the word
[31:56] of god
[31:57] and we find that to the message and you
[32:00] know just
[32:02] look at this in a particular way this
[32:03] evening you know when we measure
[32:06] something
[32:07] you know somebody might says uh you you
[32:09] speak of somebody you said well is he
[32:11] short or is he tall and you know my wife
[32:15] might say about me well my husband is a
[32:17] very tall person but that is because
[32:20] she's a very short person
[32:23] and and so you know so she looks up and
[32:26] everything she sees above her she said
[32:28] well he's stall and and you know you
[32:30] said about my wife i said well she's a
[32:31] very short woman because i'm keep
[32:33] looking down
[32:34] but that is not measurement that is just
[32:37] a concept
[32:39] so you say no oh tall exactly are you
[32:43] and so you get a measuring stick and you
[32:46] measure it right you know you've got
[32:49] something in weight and you said well
[32:51] well i've got a whole leap and i said
[32:53] how much exactly do you really have so
[32:56] you've got to get a balance to weigh the
[32:58] thing really right now truth as we say
[33:02] as believer
[33:03] is something that must be measured to us
[33:06] really because actually there is a lot
[33:09] of things called truth
[33:11] you know people talks about the baptist
[33:13] truth and the mentalist truth and you
[33:15] know pentecostal truth and you know all
[33:17] of this thing really but but truth in
[33:20] order for it to be true
[33:22] there is three things that got to be
[33:24] established one there's got to be
[33:27] distinctiveness
[33:29] there's got to be consistency and
[33:31] there's got to be a consensus
[33:34] for it to be true
[33:36] your poor
[33:37] writing even there in galatians paul
[33:40] says
[33:41] and if
[33:42] an angel from heaven should come to you
[33:44] and teach you any other truth
[33:47] that that which we have teach he said
[33:50] let him be a curse amen jump to john the
[33:54] revelator he meant jesus now speaking to
[33:57] him john uh he said to john he said and
[34:00] if anything be added to it or anything
[34:03] be taken from it
[34:05] it's got to be as it is
[34:08] now here it is that jesus came in coming
[34:12] to the synagogue this sabbath day
[34:14] and you know you can imagine that
[34:16] uh the the the fame of jesus was now
[34:20] being echoed in the regions around
[34:23] and the bible says he came back to
[34:25] nazareth where he was brought up and
[34:27] there they present to him the scroll you
[34:30] know this young prophet let him read the
[34:32] scripture came in this sabbath day
[34:35] and the bible says that and he found the
[34:38] place where it was written right brother
[34:41] branham said like this he found the
[34:43] place where it was written of him
[34:48] because what he did
[34:49] he took the prophecy of isaiah and he
[34:53] personalized the word and he bring that
[34:56] which was even by revelation that came
[35:00] to the prophet he bring for a
[35:02] manifestation right there before their
[35:04] eyes
[35:07] i say like this many times
[35:09] that the word
[35:11] that was dormant on the pages for years
[35:14] that many times they've read the same
[35:17] scripture
[35:18] amen but that day
[35:20] that word becomes flesh and we're
[35:22] standing right there before their very
[35:24] eyes
[35:25] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[35:29] right hallelujah amen now it was not
[35:32] just someone quoting isaiah the prophet
[35:36] exactly
[35:37] yet when isaiah speak it
[35:39] he meant that which move isaiah to speak
[35:42] up was upon isaiah
[35:45] but when he came the one isaiah was
[35:48] looking to when he was on the scene this
[35:51] was not
[35:52] isaiah
[35:54] this was a word himself
[35:58] the bible says and when he spoke it
[36:00] all eyes were fastened on him
[36:04] brother said he said they said no man
[36:07] ever speak like this man speak before
[36:11] there is something about the word maybe
[36:13] when he took the word when he took it
[36:15] from the pages there's something about
[36:18] the way that he said it
[36:20] it's like the touch
[36:22] of the masters and
[36:24] upon the word of god
[36:26] hallelujah you know that message the
[36:28] anointed ones at the end time
[36:31] we've learned many things about the
[36:33] anointing
[36:35] in the bright age
[36:36] that's right and one thing brother brown
[36:38] showed us
[36:39] he said it's not the anointing that is
[36:42] upon the man which that anointing is a
[36:45] true anointing from god but he said even
[36:48] in the midst of that anointing he said
[36:50] you watch the teaching right to measure
[36:55] him and what is true today
[36:57] america can you imagine imagine i mean
[37:00] we watch the preachers preach and i mean
[37:02] we watch different ones and we said oh
[37:04] what anointing was upon him but what did
[37:08] he say right how did he bring that word
[37:11] to perfection
[37:13] him and there in the old testament
[37:15] they are the measuring sticker for
[37:18] everything that i'm an utter whatever
[37:20] was his experience or whatever he had
[37:23] came in the priests at the uramus upon
[37:26] his breastplate hallelujah amen if he
[37:29] had a dream or a vision him or a word of
[37:32] wisdom he mean he would not bring it to
[37:34] the priest and say that it was your
[37:37] experience and he said if the lighter
[37:39] amen never shun hallelujah then that is
[37:42] not from god
[37:45] i say what a way they had it
[37:47] and compare that to the way that we've
[37:49] got it today
[37:50] i said that every man's word
[37:53] has got to dovetail with the true
[37:56] revealed word of god
[37:58] glory
[37:59] and listen my words carefully with the
[38:01] true reveal word of god he said oh but
[38:05] hallelujah but that's what the bible
[38:06] says
[38:07] amen but we've got the reveal word of
[38:10] god in this day him in first curtailing
[38:13] with the scriptures then everything that
[38:16] comes afterwards there is a measuring
[38:18] stick for it it's the word of god
[38:21] hallelujah
[38:23] amen
[38:24] you know so brother branham tells us
[38:26] he said now we're gonna have the former
[38:28] rain and the latter rain right and
[38:31] everything has got to come in its season
[38:34] but the brand said pentecost with the
[38:35] gifts
[38:37] thought that they had all that was
[38:39] required from scripture
[38:41] amen the teaching reign came you know
[38:44] we've looked at the progression of the
[38:46] messenger amen you know brother branham
[38:48] i find it when you look at the messages
[38:50] of 1962 brother branham himself as a
[38:53] person amen as a man called from god he
[38:56] was at a crossroad
[38:58] he realized that something more
[39:01] had to come on the scene brother branham
[39:03] said he didn't know what it was hey it
[39:06] might be god's gonna take him off the
[39:07] scene anybody know that amen he's on the
[39:10] brink of something that was greater he
[39:14] said i brought you to this position and
[39:16] he was looking he said might be he meant
[39:18] somebody's gonna come after me like the
[39:20] minister of john the baptist and jesus
[39:23] hey that's gonna take you hey man a
[39:24] little further but he knew that there
[39:27] was something there amen glory
[39:30] truth
[39:32] was being delivered
[39:35] yet truth a useless word was being
[39:38] developed right man are you there with
[39:40] me because brethren true to him and by
[39:44] itself and then you know we we take him
[39:47] a concert from god and we said oh i
[39:50] believe
[39:51] amen i believe him on the basis of my
[39:54] faith believing in god amen how many
[39:56] truths are your god
[39:58] it's according to the word
[40:00] amen right are you there with me
[40:03] amen
[40:04] so 1962 before the seals were open and
[40:07] they were coming forth from the seven
[40:09] church age messenger amen which could
[40:12] have been proved to be actually former
[40:15] or or the teaching reign and that would
[40:18] have soon bring the latter rain aiming
[40:20] on the scene
[40:21] everything
[40:23] isn't hallelujah but god needed to bring
[40:26] to the bride amen was right there
[40:29] remember the time had to be right
[40:32] you know brethren we've got to realize
[40:33] that brother branham and he came to us
[40:36] as a prophet but yet he had a
[40:38] progressive ministry
[40:40] and the minister moved from one stage to
[40:42] another to another like any other man's
[40:45] ministry
[40:46] amen what was it coming to he was coming
[40:48] to the capstone amen was bringing us to
[40:51] a point where we're leaving him in the
[40:54] principles of baptism aiming of
[40:56] repentance and the laying on of answer
[40:59] him he said let's go on to perfection
[41:02] and that's what the world was doing to
[41:04] you and i am
[41:06] in the hebrew message
[41:08] chapter three brother brown say like
[41:10] this he said now it don't matter how
[41:13] great the experience is
[41:16] unless it compares with the scripture
[41:19] that's a measuring stick amen
[41:22] right it's wrong right he said you're in
[41:25] front of him he made no matter how good
[41:27] the prophet was
[41:29] if he spoke and then lights didn't flash
[41:32] on that europe was wrong
[41:35] how will the dream seem
[41:37] if it didn't flash under uranus it was
[41:40] wrong
[41:42] can you believe that
[41:43] when the priesthood ended then god put
[41:46] his bible up hallelujah paul said and if
[41:49] an angel from heaven come down right
[41:52] what authority do you speak with
[41:55] me amen amen
[41:58] angel come down from heaven
[42:02] can you think about it am i amen you
[42:05] think that everything that comes from
[42:06] heaven come down should have been from
[42:08] god
[42:10] paul was so sure
[42:13] of the truth that he was holding to
[42:16] esau knew that he had met god face to
[42:19] face
[42:20] and that which i know have is not what i
[42:22] learned at the feet of gamel but god is
[42:26] a revelation of jesus christ he said
[42:28] and when that revelation was so revealed
[42:32] to him he said if an angel from heaven
[42:34] could i challenge him right on this word
[42:36] that i believe right brethren
[42:39] if what you have doesn't come to that
[42:42] point to keep questioning all right
[42:46] is that right
[42:48] amen
[42:49] if it doesn't come to this point you're
[42:52] gonna keep questioning right
[42:54] this was a true measuring stick that
[42:57] paul knew exactly what he was talking
[42:59] about right he were questioning no more
[43:02] himself but he was positive that god is
[43:05] in this
[43:07] so if an angel come
[43:09] and say anything else let him be a curse
[43:12] because upon you what i have is a mind
[43:15] of god amen
[43:17] amen amen
[43:19] hallelujah an angel from heaven right
[43:22] hallelujah so to john the revelator
[43:26] which was having god himself he said i
[43:29] jesus and my danger to vindicate
[43:32] or to show these things he said if any
[43:35] man will add one word to it
[43:38] hello or take one word out of it the
[43:42] same will be taken out of the book of
[43:45] israel hallelujah of life amen
[43:48] therefore these experiences and these
[43:50] things that we have happening i don't
[43:52] know it wasn't vindicated by god's word
[43:56] and anything that you have that is not
[43:59] vindicated by god's word you can throw
[44:02] it aside exactly
[44:04] so many times we come to the message we
[44:06] take our former understanding
[44:08] or former experience
[44:10] you said well you know god called me out
[44:12] of this
[44:13] or god called me when i was a baptist
[44:15] god called me when i was in the
[44:17] mentalist church.com but god never kept
[44:20] you there
[44:22] are you with me right right hey god amen
[44:25] i give great respect and to those that
[44:28] were before me i give great respect
[44:32] aiming for the men who would point me to
[44:34] this
[44:35] i give great respect for the god and the
[44:38] vessels that god uses hey that stayed
[44:40] there for years and years amen until god
[44:44] brought me to this position remember
[44:46] brethren i tell you ain't in my lesions
[44:49] is not a great manner peace to the word
[44:52] of god
[44:53] amen
[44:54] amen
[44:56] yet
[44:57] i would not want it to be one day
[45:00] that i disrespect those
[45:03] are you there vessels me
[45:04] i respect their stance remember many
[45:07] times you find him in that we're being
[45:10] held back and then because we said i've
[45:12] got to give respect payment to this
[45:14] person because it brought me to this
[45:17] position
[45:18] reverend no man can put you in it
[45:22] are you there with me and we are saying
[45:24] no man can take you out of it
[45:27] are you there with me hey man it's god
[45:29] who led you to that position it's by the
[45:32] grace of god give me that holy mayor god
[45:35] stood there as i was moved by the holy
[45:38] ghost remember that holy ghost has gone
[45:41] be in you
[45:44] amen
[45:45] so
[45:47] what do i measure that which god has
[45:49] given me
[45:51] to with right
[45:52] so i said well
[45:54] you know because i came out of this
[45:56] ministry then i'm going to measure
[45:58] everything by it
[46:00] that's where we fail yeah
[46:02] hello somebody
[46:04] amen
[46:05] because we've got to go beyond that
[46:08] and everyone is going to prove him for
[46:09] himself
[46:11] every person is going to be certain of
[46:14] their position
[46:16] in other words that position that paul
[46:19] come to where he said now this note that
[46:21] i have that i'm looking at if an angel
[46:24] from heaven come
[46:26] and say anything else let it be a cursor
[46:29] because i'm positive that what i have is
[46:32] the mind of god right right amen amen
[46:36] hallelujah right
[46:38] yes sir
[46:39] aiming to read to the tears are
[46:42] rejoicing will continue to rejoice
[46:45] until the separation time come
[46:48] amen
[46:49] hallelujah him in the true anointing
[46:51] falls and those with good doctrine yeah
[46:55] an astonishing amen you might be
[46:58] astonished but it falls on those with
[47:00] bad doctrine oh yeah
[47:02] it falls on people that has mixed
[47:04] doctrine right i mean there's people amy
[47:07] you will believe this thing and you
[47:09] won't believe this thing i mean you
[47:11] believe this thing and i won't believe
[47:14] that
[47:15] that is why it's so important for us as
[47:17] believers
[47:18] you know we come to the word of god and
[47:20] you come to a ministry
[47:22] and many times we're being held back by
[47:25] him and the experiences that you've had
[47:27] before
[47:28] amen you know brother so-and-so i teach
[47:30] it like this and and you know i really
[47:32] love brother so-and-so and you know i
[47:35] can't even take that because brother
[47:37] so-and-so you've got to have a measuring
[47:39] stick that you measure every man's work
[47:42] by
[47:43] right are you there with me
[47:45] amen
[47:46] see if it's the truth or not right
[47:49] amen amen hallelujah
[47:52] amen
[47:55] yes sir
[47:56] amen
[47:58] so we've got true doctrine we've got
[48:00] paul's doctrine we've got mixed doctrine
[48:02] amen
[48:03] now here is a sticker and many ministers
[48:08] in the final day and hour
[48:10] are being deceived because of holy
[48:12] spirit anointing of this last hour that
[48:16] has blessed the truth even through their
[48:18] ministries continue to anoint even
[48:21] though he may be a fail or put aside
[48:26] many revelation of the word of god right
[48:29] right
[48:30] i said well you know i don't teach
[48:32] that i remember
[48:36] a few years back
[48:37] you know where the seals were amen
[48:39] brother said well you know well i don't
[48:41] read that
[48:43] i don't read that i remember brother one
[48:45] time he said when i take a book to read
[48:48] it you say
[48:49] you know there's a lot of things said at
[48:50] the front part
[48:52] there's a message given but i go to the
[48:54] back
[48:55] because i want to go to the pearl line
[48:58] and i want to see the acts of healing
[49:00] yeah because as far as he's concerned if
[49:03] there's anything in it
[49:05] it's not the words of the messenger but
[49:08] it's the act of healing right
[49:10] exactly if he's jehovah my healer
[49:14] he is my savior right are you here with
[49:17] me
[49:18] and he's no less my savior because he's
[49:21] my healer
[49:22] are you here with me and everything in
[49:24] the back is good
[49:26] but what about that which is before amen
[49:29] because the words at the stage that i
[49:32] might prove the vindication of god right
[49:35] are you there with me
[49:36] but it further on i realize
[49:38] that brother brandon in a coma heavy to
[49:41] give us a healing revival
[49:43] as a matter of fact i wasn't back there
[49:45] then and it didn't matter if john ryan's
[49:48] eye was open or not i mean that had
[49:50] nothing to do with me but there was a
[49:53] word a word legacy women that were lying
[49:56] their dormant amen and i'm gonna call on
[49:59] the scene and take the word and make the
[50:01] words of the people live again in my
[50:03] life
[50:04] amen amen you believe you've got a part
[50:07] in it yes
[50:08] amen
[50:10] hallelujah
[50:11] amen
[50:12] when we talk about the deceivers
[50:14] amen
[50:16] hallelujah
[50:17] even if we are honest every one of us
[50:20] how do you could bear witness
[50:22] that there were times in your life
[50:24] amen when you saw when you thought you
[50:26] saw things amen then you explained
[50:29] things by the anointed seal that you had
[50:32] amen when the light shone underworld you
[50:34] had to come and say to yourself him and
[50:37] my understanding was wrong right right
[50:40] brother talks about my former
[50:42] understanding
[50:45] are you there with me
[50:47] my former understanding
[50:49] because it was progressing
[50:52] in that prophetic ministry
[50:56] there's a big debate with the brother
[50:58] branham right in 1933 at everything
[51:02] and he was given it in portion of god
[51:04] was revealing it as he move along right
[51:07] hey hello somebody
[51:10] amen
[51:11] but i tell you
[51:13] brother branham was not god
[51:15] he was a man like you and i
[51:18] and your god has given him that great
[51:20] portion of heaven because of the
[51:22] position that he take
[51:24] are you here with me remember brethren i
[51:27] believe that he's waiting on you and i
[51:29] to come to the position of that
[51:31] revelation that he had and he didn't
[51:33] know what to do with himself because
[51:36] here it was the word was revealed and he
[51:38] preached it from the pulpit and then the
[51:40] people him were there back then 40 years
[51:43] ago and they did not see it and there
[51:44] was nothing that he could do about it
[51:49] that there were messages that he
[51:51] preached
[51:52] hallelujah souls that are in prison now
[51:55] and naturally by what he had right there
[51:57] before him and the things that god
[51:59] showed him he thought that might be
[52:01] tonight it's the last night and if you
[52:04] come tomorrow amen holiday the door of
[52:07] mercy's closed
[52:10] because of what he was going through
[52:13] and many times i've got to even ask
[52:16] myself i said lord could it be what is
[52:18] happening to me all right
[52:20] this that i'm looking at right now if
[52:23] the people would get it
[52:25] what kind of people we would have been
[52:28] amen hello
[52:30] but say it and you say it and the people
[52:33] believe the same way
[52:35] the people walk the same way
[52:38] you say it and you see that you're
[52:39] screaming and the people are not moving
[52:42] and you're wondering what is happening
[52:44] right
[52:46] but brethren true to master consensus
[52:51] so what are you going to keep preaching
[52:54] until it materialized
[52:56] and somebody said i never saw it when
[52:59] you first said it but today amen because
[53:02] that's the way my life was right amen
[53:06] hallelujah sometimes we get impatient
[53:09] sometimes an evangelist come true and he
[53:12] said well what's the matter with these
[53:13] people
[53:14] are you gonna watch the spirit of an
[53:16] evangelist because he dropped the bomb
[53:18] and he expect everybody to be moving
[53:20] yeah and if they're not moving but
[53:23] brother graham said the pastor comes and
[53:24] he picks up the pieces
[53:26] hallelujah any channel is it right for
[53:29] the people
[53:30] amen
[53:31] and you know it's not preaching
[53:33] that stabilizes the church right in his
[53:36] teaching
[53:37] amen amen
[53:39] i have a church not taught right it will
[53:42] never had true revelation
[53:45] amen
[53:47] hallelujah
[53:49] yes sir
[53:51] amen
[53:52] brother bran says
[53:54] the zeal of this hour is for a man to
[53:57] realize that i was wrong
[54:00] and when you say that you people begin
[54:03] to look at the ministers
[54:05] but what about your life
[54:18] were you always right
[54:21] did you always see what you're seeing
[54:23] today and the things that you held on to
[54:26] that further on god showed you not man
[54:29] but god show you hey that's not where it
[54:32] is did you recognize and come to
[54:35] recognize that i was wrong amen
[54:38] amen i love somebody
[54:41] amen
[54:42] brother may i say the anointing is not
[54:44] the measuring stick right right
[54:47] are you with me
[54:50] and many times what we call anointing
[54:53] that's not really true anointing
[54:55] brother bran said the greatest anointing
[54:57] that we've seen is the anointing that
[55:00] was upon jesus that day amen and the
[55:02] bible said he took his seat
[55:05] amen hello
[55:07] the anointing led him to the place where
[55:10] it was recorded
[55:12] hello and he brought history into the
[55:15] present state before them and the
[55:17] unbelievers were sitting there fasten
[55:19] their eyes on him i never get anything
[55:22] out of him
[55:23] and he say to them
[55:25] this day
[55:26] amen is this scripture fulfillment for
[55:29] your very eyes what you want to be
[55:32] there when prophecies were being
[55:35] fulfilled would you want to be there
[55:38] when the word made flesh right before
[55:40] your eyes
[55:41] and they were still looking for it yeah
[55:46] they never stopped hallelujah
[55:49] and if their nighting is not the
[55:51] measuring stick then what then right
[55:54] right because there's men with great
[55:56] anointing
[55:58] great anointing
[56:00] check the teaching
[56:04] go check the teaching
[56:06] and we said
[56:08] if some men could live the way they
[56:10] could preach
[56:12] yeah kill somebody but the people is
[56:15] looking for an attraction right amen
[56:18] hello
[56:19] they want to see them moving right they
[56:22] will be stabilized enough they need to
[56:24] absorb truth for themselves right now
[56:27] amen break from that it's not shouting
[56:29] you grow
[56:31] hello
[56:32] is when you can take these things and
[56:35] ponder these things in your heart
[56:38] let it sit there somewhere
[56:40] oh hallelujah glory amen yes sir
[56:44] brethren i'll tell you the thought of
[56:46] the word of christ
[56:48] that is a measuring stick
[56:50] right it's recorded it's written right
[56:52] i'll live by the message of the hour
[56:55] amen
[56:56] note before the lamb take the book
[57:01] we were mailing presuming
[57:04] all right
[57:05] hello somebody right you know you take
[57:08] revelation 5
[57:09] and you know we preach that with all
[57:11] excitement
[57:12] and the crowd entouter who is worthy and
[57:15] there was none found worthy and then a
[57:18] land came him in a bloody lamb and he
[57:20] take the book and we get all excited
[57:23] anymore to read it there from revelation
[57:25] 5 that meant nothing
[57:28] but when we saw it
[57:30] in sinai symbol what is in reality
[57:34] amen that brother branham said and i
[57:35] would have made an awful mistake
[57:38] the book was still closer hey but he
[57:41] came into the room
[57:43] and brother brown said hey man he
[57:44] prepared a message did you know he
[57:46] prepared a message
[57:48] and he went over that this one and he
[57:50] researched very well i took what
[57:52] everybody said on the subject and he was
[57:54] going to present it that night he said
[57:56] well he came into the room
[57:59] it was too much late hour aiming for
[58:02] that message we preached over again
[58:04] god was ready were the people ready
[58:10] and i asked you the question is god
[58:12] ready tonight
[58:14] is god ready today all right but then
[58:17] the question still is is the people
[58:18] ready right amen
[58:21] oh yes
[58:22] amen
[58:24] brother you know brother brahms showed
[58:25] us he said this word
[58:27] cannot be tampered with
[58:30] and certainly the first and the second
[58:32] pull
[58:33] him and yes him and there will be a lot
[58:35] of impersonation upon that
[58:37] and that is why he mean that's not
[58:39] really the essence of the message
[58:42] are you there with me amen that was a
[58:44] what a great attraction
[58:46] it was to bring us to this position
[58:49] and might be if you take that attraction
[58:51] from all of it and where would you and i
[58:53] be right because it took an attraction
[58:56] to take us out of where we were
[58:59] aiming to be stabilized long enough pay
[59:01] me to say god can vindicate himself
[59:04] payment by this person in that way him
[59:06] and then god must have something to say
[59:09] so he said yes god sends a prophet in
[59:11] this day but may we say there's a voice
[59:14] the voice of god has come to us in this
[59:17] day and if it's the voice of god it is
[59:20] not what he did it is what he say
[59:27] you know hey man you know many people
[59:29] like might like hunting because brother
[59:31] branham was a hunter it is not what he
[59:34] did
[59:34] right
[59:35] hello
[59:36] i mean i ain't got nothing to hunt back
[59:38] home
[59:42] i don't know
[59:43] and if i get a gun they put me in prison
[59:46] i don't i i can't do that
[59:49] it's not what he did it's what he said
[59:52] amen you know what i hear people talking
[59:54] about hey man you know i dare and a
[59:56] certain deer i don't even understand
[59:58] some of the dragons they're using
[1:00:01] it is not in my culture right now
[1:00:03] but don't put near the outside
[1:00:06] because this belonged to me
[1:00:09] it's not what it did it's what he said
[1:00:13] are all
[1:00:13] there with me
[1:00:14] i'm gonna try to be something that i'm
[1:00:17] not right
[1:00:18] hello somebody i mean i ain't going to
[1:00:20] come here in the in the winter and walk
[1:00:23] out there with a gun in the woods i'll
[1:00:24] just reach the dead
[1:00:27] it's not a part of me
[1:00:29] but there's something that he said
[1:00:32] that i wasn't there but when it hit me
[1:00:35] because i was there in that channel
[1:00:39] david said in psalm 42 and the heart
[1:00:41] parted after the war so i parted my soul
[1:00:45] after the old god
[1:00:46] amen i came to that stage i was yearning
[1:00:49] for god i needed more of god and there
[1:00:52] was a more of god for me to receive
[1:00:59] yes sir
[1:01:01] oh
[1:01:02] you know we ought to stop and listen to
[1:01:04] ourselves sometimes
[1:01:07] some of the most foolish statements that
[1:01:09] people make
[1:01:10] within our circle today
[1:01:13] and you know they say that because
[1:01:14] they're not listening to what they're
[1:01:16] really saying right
[1:01:19] the the the
[1:01:20] hey they said the bride's
[1:01:22] understanding is beyond what the prophet
[1:01:25] saw
[1:01:28] hello
[1:01:29] yeah
[1:01:31] the bride's understanding is beyond what
[1:01:33] the prophet saw
[1:01:36] let me tell you this
[1:01:37] to david
[1:01:39] it was real
[1:01:41] when david was speaking
[1:01:44] hallelujah when david cried out in agony
[1:01:48] david didn't understand that he wasn't
[1:01:50] talking of himself
[1:01:52] right he didn't realize he was
[1:01:54] prophesying because what happened to him
[1:01:56] was so perfect
[1:01:58] in the day that he was standing in
[1:02:01] when isaiah spoke it
[1:02:03] isaiah didn't even realize he was
[1:02:05] talking about another day
[1:02:07] oh they said oh and he saw the lord in
[1:02:10] the temple amen he described what he saw
[1:02:15] but i'm unclean and i dwell on people of
[1:02:17] unclean lips and then when he was burned
[1:02:20] said who will go and eyes i said here am
[1:02:22] i sent me and then the word came to him
[1:02:25] for a virgin shall conceive an isaiah
[1:02:28] echoed it it was written he was put
[1:02:30] there as a witness and then he see a
[1:02:32] false prophet when he died yes they said
[1:02:36] because here it is witness against him
[1:02:39] but today we asked the question was the
[1:02:41] truth
[1:02:43] was the truth amen
[1:02:46] happened after hallelujah buddy it
[1:02:48] happened
[1:02:50] right amen
[1:02:52] should we shut our mouths
[1:02:55] because we don't see the manifestation
[1:02:58] of what we're looking for all right and
[1:03:00] brethren i tell you amen the bible says
[1:03:04] we love angels in our midst right
[1:03:06] amen that is why i trust
[1:03:09] in the ministry of revelation
[1:03:12] because there's gifted men who god has
[1:03:15] used and me to see the things that will
[1:03:17] be heir after and they heckle it in
[1:03:20] their day and there's people who look at
[1:03:22] them and wonder hey do they really
[1:03:24] understand what they're saying and i say
[1:03:27] this for them they don't have to
[1:03:29] understand what they're saying
[1:03:31] for isaiah never understood what he was
[1:03:33] saying but he believed in you because
[1:03:35] his memory felt like that and he had cut
[1:03:38] into love
[1:03:40] jeremiah probably said if i know what i
[1:03:42] was going to say i would not say it
[1:03:45] in a day like now
[1:03:47] but he said when he was in me
[1:03:49] he said i felt like fire
[1:03:52] shut up within my bones
[1:03:54] hey man does the brookie white get
[1:03:56] swapping
[1:04:10] oh they said he didn't have perfect
[1:04:13] understanding
[1:04:15] he didn't mean that
[1:04:16] that way
[1:04:18] he didn't mean it that way so what we
[1:04:20] try to do is try to get a consensus of
[1:04:23] men to temper down revelation to what we
[1:04:27] can believe
[1:04:28] that is bringing god down to match your
[1:04:31] own understanding all right right hello
[1:04:33] somebody all right amen but what a
[1:04:36] statement brother brian made
[1:04:39] he said and what if
[1:04:42] the missing limbs would return to the
[1:04:44] body right yeah and brother branham say
[1:04:46] that in the presumption
[1:04:48] that if you're going to stand there
[1:04:50] perfect
[1:04:51] like between 18 and 21 he said all the
[1:04:53] deformity that you see in the flesh is
[1:04:56] going to go away
[1:04:58] hello somebody
[1:05:00] amen
[1:05:01] so somebody's going to go there and try
[1:05:03] to practice to bring that missing limb
[1:05:09] right
[1:05:11] you know what sister
[1:05:13] at mom's funeral
[1:05:14] a sister that was with her from way back
[1:05:17] then
[1:05:18] was talking about something that she did
[1:05:19] some years when she was a young
[1:05:21] christian and i'll tell you they were
[1:05:23] born out there in the denomination but
[1:05:26] they had a good dose of christianity
[1:05:28] they said one day she was walking across
[1:05:30] the
[1:05:31] cemetery and this little sister was
[1:05:33] walking she was very young then he said
[1:05:35] she was walking with her they said she
[1:05:37] stopped out there in the middle of the
[1:05:38] cemetery and began to look around and
[1:05:40] she began to say mom what is it mama and
[1:05:43] she's just in this day is looking off
[1:05:45] and she said she shout out lazarus
[1:05:47] comfort
[1:05:58] he said to them he said what if there
[1:06:00] was a last horseman for the cemetery
[1:06:02] that stepped foot from the grave
[1:06:06] but you know what brethren it was so
[1:06:09] real
[1:06:10] she felt so real in her christian
[1:06:12] experience
[1:06:13] amen
[1:06:14] praise god
[1:06:15] brethren i'll tell you what
[1:06:17] what a day when the supernatural
[1:06:20] that we looked at today becomes natural
[1:06:23] amen
[1:06:26] today we put in a class of oh that's a
[1:06:29] supernatural
[1:06:31] put it on the top shelf because that is
[1:06:34] a supernatural it's not time for that
[1:06:36] yet but what a day when your revelation
[1:06:39] that the supernatural becomes so natural
[1:06:44] oh hallelujah
[1:06:46] i mean that i can look at my body and
[1:06:48] speak to my body
[1:06:50] and nature observe
[1:06:53] hello somebody i'm confirmed by your
[1:06:55] voice that's right
[1:06:58] benjamin i don't know about you but i
[1:07:00] believe that we're getting to him
[1:07:02] oh yes
[1:07:03] oh he didn't mean what he said he meant
[1:07:05] exactly what he said
[1:07:07] did i sign me what he said did jeremiah
[1:07:10] mean what he said that he meant exactly
[1:07:13] what he said
[1:07:14] because the power of god moves upon him
[1:07:17] that is truth revelation
[1:07:21] amen
[1:07:22] but i'll tell you there's something
[1:07:23] about that revelation
[1:07:25] somebody
[1:07:26] somewhere i've got to be so moved upon
[1:07:30] to let that live
[1:07:32] glory
[1:07:34] oh yes
[1:07:35] the sleeping saints
[1:07:37] they're waiting on you and eye
[1:07:40] to catch the last heart of god to call
[1:07:43] it out of the earth
[1:07:45] that's right
[1:07:46] is that supernatural no sir
[1:07:49] it is a one-man manifest
[1:07:52] are you there with me
[1:07:53] what are they waiting on are they
[1:07:56] looking over the masters of heaven i
[1:07:58] said go on go on press on all right man
[1:08:02] amen amen when we get small and slack
[1:08:06] and begin to pull back
[1:08:08] oh you know where we're too tired right
[1:08:11] we're just received yeah yeah right
[1:08:13] we're just deceived right amen
[1:08:16] you know i said back home when you know
[1:08:18] you take these young people
[1:08:20] and you know when they start to
[1:08:22] get into courtship
[1:08:25] when the boy says the donkey boy say he
[1:08:29] loves that beautiful girl and they begin
[1:08:31] to have these butterflies in their
[1:08:32] stomach
[1:08:33] and they've got a chance to go see one
[1:08:35] another
[1:08:37] and it doesn't matter what time that if
[1:08:39] your brother waited to smile because
[1:08:40] he's been there i mean he doesn't matter
[1:08:43] how they feel there's something burning
[1:08:45] somewhere
[1:08:47] that they just want to see each other
[1:08:49] they just want to fellowship with each
[1:08:51] other right although we fall so out of
[1:08:53] love with god
[1:08:55] amen you don't remember midweek service
[1:08:57] is such a burden
[1:08:59] baby because you know you've got to
[1:09:00] understand brother that we've got we've
[1:09:03] worked all day
[1:09:05] it the past master was all over us even
[1:09:08] though we worked so hard we are so tired
[1:09:10] are we gonna go get something we're
[1:09:12] gonna do this we're gonna do that but we
[1:09:15] find time for the secular things of life
[1:09:17] what about the time for god are we
[1:09:20] losing our experience
[1:09:23] come on church
[1:09:25] all right
[1:09:27] i'll tell you the truth
[1:09:29] i thought
[1:09:31] and i guess i must have been real stupid
[1:09:34] i thought that the zeal that i saw we
[1:09:36] had when we first received a message we
[1:09:39] would still have it today
[1:09:41] i really thought that
[1:09:44] but somebody pinched me and let me
[1:09:46] realize oh you're stupid
[1:09:50] you ain't going to have it
[1:09:52] but brother wait i'll tell you what i
[1:09:54] don't know what is happening there's a
[1:09:56] great cooling offer but i want to god we
[1:09:59] have the same purpose and we are
[1:10:01] yesterday amen i tell you hey they don't
[1:10:05] talk about the word no sir they talk
[1:10:07] about the current events of the church
[1:10:10] amen hallelujah who is missing where hey
[1:10:13] who is the walking right maybe they talk
[1:10:16] about only the social events of the
[1:10:18] church remember that word to god when
[1:10:20] the people leave they're talking about
[1:10:22] the fire of god they've been so
[1:10:25] stimulating with the oil and the wine
[1:10:27] that they can't wait to meet
[1:10:36] but you know you're not where you used
[1:10:37] to be
[1:10:39] amen
[1:10:41] you you know you're not there
[1:10:43] oh they said he was speaking in symbols
[1:10:45] and types
[1:10:46] and we are hallelujah and we have those
[1:10:50] hallelujah
[1:10:51] we are the opening those to you
[1:10:54] but brother never know what he was
[1:10:56] saying he didn't know what he was saying
[1:10:59] brethren i thought it was so real
[1:11:03] it was so real
[1:11:06] go read souls that are imprisoned
[1:11:08] because my father listened to the teeth
[1:11:11] it was so real to him that night
[1:11:15] go listen the message
[1:11:16] hallelujah
[1:11:18] amen
[1:11:19] how did this day
[1:11:21] is this picture fulfilled
[1:11:23] it was so real
[1:11:24] when they took him out he was still
[1:11:26] screaming out
[1:11:27] and he was updating
[1:11:29] hallelujah what jesus did in nazareth
[1:11:32] that day he was updating it that night
[1:11:35] right
[1:11:35] hallelujah he preached in middle school
[1:11:38] and they said when they take him through
[1:11:39] the little door at the back i mean i
[1:11:41] went there and looked at it and they
[1:11:43] said he was still screaming he was tired
[1:11:46] his feet was going down but he was
[1:11:48] screaming because something happened and
[1:11:51] this day is
[1:11:53] to fulfill before your very eyes
[1:11:56] there's going to be great anointing
[1:11:59] and the teaching is false
[1:12:02] because they've walked away from the
[1:12:04] word of god they don't believe it
[1:12:06] oh hallelujah and you're watching the
[1:12:08] gift
[1:12:11] there's no word of truth
[1:12:13] are you with me
[1:12:15] hallelujah
[1:12:16] because the school
[1:12:18] that they take it to
[1:12:20] i mean they take it back to those with
[1:12:22] anointing
[1:12:24] for the men of anointing become the
[1:12:26] judge of the word
[1:12:27] they become the measuring stick
[1:12:30] right hello somebody they don't care
[1:12:32] what the reveal words say
[1:12:34] they look into the anointing million for
[1:12:37] their eyes
[1:12:38] oh little slacks brother so-and-so
[1:12:40] anybody think about it because you know
[1:12:42] he's got a great anointing on him yeah
[1:12:48] oh jesus hallelujah
[1:12:52] you know i say in this day that we're
[1:12:53] living in
[1:12:54] may god
[1:12:56] be merciful to us
[1:12:58] may god may almighty god
[1:13:02] be merciful to us in our experience
[1:13:07] because i tell the truth
[1:13:09] you let somebody comes on the scene
[1:13:11] tomorrow
[1:13:12] and they begin to
[1:13:14] even see the work of the first and the
[1:13:16] second pull
[1:13:17] and then you know that they never
[1:13:19] receive the turd
[1:13:21] because they start to run falling after
[1:13:23] the sign the people want to see them
[1:13:25] moving
[1:13:27] they know somebody for the greatest move
[1:13:30] that it ever was it's a moving of the
[1:13:33] opening of the world
[1:13:36] that's right
[1:13:40] so you know
[1:13:41] amen we preach daniel sent two weeks and
[1:13:43] we fold it and we put it aside and we go
[1:13:46] to the seals and we preach then we put
[1:13:48] it aside
[1:13:49] hello somebody
[1:13:50] hello somebody
[1:13:52] uh we're going to something else
[1:13:54] but if i tell you i want to see somebody
[1:13:56] take the review word and let us lay
[1:13:58] there in it right until the day of jesus
[1:14:00] christ
[1:14:02] are you there that's not laid aside now
[1:14:05] oh you know the people aren't stirring a
[1:14:07] little bit people need to see a little
[1:14:09] bit of emotions but that's not going to
[1:14:11] get us out of here
[1:14:14] you might as well go back to the
[1:14:15] denomination
[1:14:17] because i tell you what they've got more
[1:14:18] than you've got oh yeah oh you know the
[1:14:20] church is not doing anything what is the
[1:14:22] church doing heading back in jamaica
[1:14:24] we've got food for the poor let them do
[1:14:25] that
[1:14:26] that is their ministry right they love
[1:14:28] somebody but we're called to preach the
[1:14:31] word
[1:14:32] whether they like it or not right amen
[1:14:36] amen amen hallelujah
[1:14:39] try to do god's service without it
[1:14:40] begins well
[1:14:41] he said now watch
[1:14:43] how close it gets to that razor hedge
[1:14:47] now between right and wrong
[1:14:51] so close
[1:14:53] so close
[1:14:54] i tell you brethren in this name
[1:14:56] whatever is your desire
[1:14:59] you have it
[1:15:02] amen

[1:15:14] anything you want you've got it
[1:15:17] are you telling me a man's got to make a
[1:15:19] conscious decision over his life
[1:15:23] but it's got to make a decision it's got
[1:15:25] to be determined what is truth
[1:15:29] pilot action
[1:15:30] what is truth
[1:15:32] jesus merely nonsense
[1:15:34] you're looking at it
[1:15:36] right
[1:15:40] amen
[1:15:41] so they're so close and remember
[1:15:43] he will fall on
[1:15:45] one or the other side
[1:15:47] and it comes down sometime
[1:15:50] like a huge razor between the the
[1:15:54] difference of right and wrong
[1:15:57] it's got to be
[1:15:58] every word of god
[1:16:01] every word of god

[1:29:14] woman
[1:29:16] and she served the church for over 40
[1:29:18] years she preached
[1:29:20] and they tell me that woman was a
[1:29:21] preacher
[1:29:23] you talk about preaching repentance and
[1:29:25] bringing sinners to their feet
[1:29:27] the woman would preach
[1:29:29] they said she had power of discernment
[1:29:32] and she was sick when there was a
[1:29:33] message
[1:29:35] the church accepted the message she was
[1:29:37] there and we took one of the little
[1:29:39] tapes and we began to play brother
[1:29:41] branham day after day after day that she
[1:29:44] heard it she said call me one day and
[1:29:47] she said brother reed you said every
[1:29:49] question that i have in my mind she said
[1:29:52] the dead man on the tape answered it and
[1:29:54] i asked you one thing would you be my
[1:29:56] pastor i said thanks be to god
[1:30:03] it's the legacy that we have today and
[1:30:05] brethren it's that that we're living on
