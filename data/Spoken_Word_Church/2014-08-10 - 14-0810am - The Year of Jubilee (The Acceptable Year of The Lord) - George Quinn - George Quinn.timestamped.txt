[0:00] amen
[0:01] good morning good morning
[0:03] this is
[0:04] a great time now is to know who you
[0:06] believe in
[0:08] amen
[0:09] because
[0:10] you know the prophet said
[0:14] that
[0:14] there will come some that make cancer
[0:17] seem like a toothache
[0:20] we see this stuff ebola
[0:23] how it spreading and they were saying
[0:25] that 70 of the people
[0:28] that come in contact with it is dying
[0:31] and so you know that's a
[0:34] terrible thing
[0:35] we're going to read from
[0:37] 2nd thessalonians
[0:39] the
[0:40] second chapter
[0:52] let us pray
[0:58] heavenly father
[1:00] we are grateful lord this day that you
[1:02] have given unto us yes lord your sinful
[1:05] your word lord to guide us and direct us
[1:09] lord let us not turn aside from your
[1:11] precious word but to hold fast
[1:14] let us
[1:15] seek each day lord of greater and
[1:17] greater understanding
[1:18] love for each thing that you promise god
[1:20] as is being fulfilled let us be a part
[1:23] of it yes lord we thank you today and
[1:26] just bless everyone lord that's present
[1:28] lord we ask you to touch every heart
[1:30] father there be anything within the
[1:32] hinders in any way lord that you will
[1:35] remove it and bring your word forth unto
[1:38] us in jesus christ now we pray amen
[1:43] second thessalonians
[1:45] the second chapter
[1:47] now we beseech you brethren
[1:50] by the coming of our lord jesus christ
[1:52] and by our gathering together unto him
[2:10] let no man deceive you by any means
[2:13] father they shall not come except there
[2:16] can be falling away first
[2:19] and that man of sin be revealed
[2:22] the son of perdition
[2:39] remember ye not that when i was with you
[2:42] i told you these things
[2:51] for the mystery of iniquity it was
[2:54] already worked
[2:55] only he who
[2:57] now led us will let until he be taken
[3:00] out of the way
[3:05] whom the lord shall consume with the
[3:07] spirit of his mouth and shall destroy
[3:10] with the brightness of his coming
[3:13] even him whose coming is after the work
[3:16] working off satan with all power and
[3:18] signs and lying
[3:23] wonders in them
[3:33] and for this cause
[3:35] god
[3:36] shall send them strong delusions that
[3:38] they should believe alive
[3:50] but we are bound to give thanks always
[3:52] to god for you
[3:54] brethren
[3:55] beloved of the lord
[3:58] because god has from the beginning
[4:01] chosen you to salvation through

[9:25] we're glad to be here
[9:26] and if you would just be seated please
[9:28] because uh this is the time
[9:32] uh
[9:33] yeah
[9:34] times times something else isn't it
[9:37] amen
[9:38] yes and uh praise the lord but uh we are
[9:42] creatures of time
[9:44] and we have to watch time and i always
[9:47] try to balance what i can do in the time
[9:50] that i've got
[9:51] and i certainly do appreciate your
[9:53] prayers and your giving we went over to
[9:56] uh india last year had a wonderful time
[9:59] there
[9:59] and uh truly
[10:02] you know it makes me feel good i
[10:04] preached in a church but 400 people in
[10:06] it and tonight
[10:08] wonderful group of people wonderful
[10:09] group of people and one of the uh one of
[10:12] the elders at the church the assistant's
[10:14] pastor he said um he said we really
[10:17] appreciate your ministry and we need
[10:19] your ministry and that's a nice thing to
[10:21] think that at least you've got a little
[10:23] bit to play amen and it's like you're
[10:25] here you might have many or whatever not
[10:27] but you still got to put to play they've
[10:29] got a part to play amen like your nails
[10:31] got a part to play
[10:32] amen if you didn't have any nails you'd
[10:34] find picking up wouldn't be easy so
[10:36] anyway i'm glad to be a part of that and
[10:40] you know
[10:41] missionary work i've never recalled my i
[10:43] call myself a pastor just visiting other
[10:46] countries a missionary no a missionary
[10:48] apostle brother samuel that's going to
[10:50] plant churches and we've helped to do
[10:52] that but um
[10:54] i'd never call myself a real tree
[10:56] missionary like that but anyway uh what
[11:00] i can say is that it's a joy to be a
[11:02] blessing to the bride of jesus christ
[11:04] that's many many years ago i made that
[11:07] decision that i was going to serve his
[11:09] bride amen and like lenion says just to
[11:12] sing a song for the bride well i've had
[11:15] a ministry to the bride and i'm glad uh
[11:17] for that and uh it works out in so many
[11:20] different ways that you'd never think
[11:22] because last year in india one of the
[11:24] little pastors uh his wife i the indians
[11:28] are they've got their culture they've
[11:29] got their way of going you know and just
[11:31] like with the irish half the american
[11:33] have and so uh she was talking to me and
[11:36] i knew she was trying to get to a point
[11:38] amen and the point was
[11:41] could i get her a bible that had big
[11:43] letters because her eyes said was that
[11:46] was her point you know so we got there
[11:48] we got there sisters nice to see you
[11:50] again god bless you you know and um uh
[11:53] she said
[11:54] could could you buy me a bible like that
[11:56] with big letters
[11:57] and i said sister i certainly could amen
[12:00] i certainly could and we did
[12:02] and then she started on again a little
[12:04] bit so i'm listening to her and i said
[12:06] go ahead sister just spit it out as it
[12:08] were and she says
[12:10] could you get new specs for me as well
[12:15] and that to me that's that's missionary
[12:17] work you you if you bless nobody else
[12:19] there at least you blessed her amen see
[12:22] and that's that's it and of course uh
[12:25] you're always using the monies that have
[12:27] come in amen to you and uh as this
[12:31] brother uh samuel said to you there you
[12:33] know we still buy the race for the
[12:35] poorer peoples uh they're not all poor
[12:37] believe me if you've got a good job and
[12:39] in a city in india you're probably
[12:41] better off than you are
[12:43] so don't be thinking this all they're
[12:44] all begging bulls you know i'm telling
[12:46] you they all got their washing machines
[12:48] and going to their big restaurants and
[12:49] all today believe me
[12:51] so anyway but in the villages they don't
[12:53] have that and
[12:55] then this year
[12:56] we were over in
[12:58] thailand to see the good people there
[13:01] and they're kind of poor you know and
[13:03] one of the reasons the pastors always
[13:05] said to me about how pure they are why
[13:07] is it is and i to tell you the truth i
[13:09] just said to him you know oh
[13:12] it's your tithing you know uh you just
[13:15] just don't teach the people enough
[13:17] tithing i remember brother samuel said
[13:19] to me one time that you know he said if
[13:21] you don't pay your tithes he said just
[13:23] pay them for a year
[13:25] and if god doesn't bless you he said
[13:27] i'll give you back every time you paid
[13:29] if god has to he's obligated to do it
[13:31] he is obligated to do it and that's
[13:34] that's why they say why i was so poor
[13:35] because they're so tight they don't want
[13:37] to give anything to god and he can't
[13:38] give a nan hang back amen so uh you know
[13:42] uh but it was a wonderful time a
[13:45] wonderful time there and just to share
[13:48] with the uh just to serve with the
[13:50] saints there and every time i go over
[13:52] there's a couple of people baptized
[13:53] there in thailand so we're thankful and
[13:55] they're getting more translated books
[13:57] and whatnot and we're thankful for these
[13:59] things and at all costs and it's good to
[14:01] help the cause that's what we're in here
[14:03] for that help the cause as best we can
[14:05] we went on over to the philippines
[14:07] and uh i'm well used to uh
[14:10] well used to getting up during the night
[14:12] amen it's one of those things that come
[14:15] with the work you know you're getting on
[14:17] buses at one o'clock in the morning and
[14:20] flights at half past 12 a.m and but i'm
[14:23] used to that night amen
[14:25] so uh praise the lord uh
[14:27] well over two million miles covered for
[14:29] the lord jesus now and i think that's
[14:32] wonderful and i'm glad it was all for
[14:34] him amen and uh
[14:36] so we went into the philippines and it
[14:39] was delightful to meet the brothers and
[14:42] uh you know uh all them little pastors
[14:44] brother samuel we've always tried to
[14:46] give them uh even if it's 75 each if
[14:48] there's 12 of them there or a couple
[14:50] extra postures you know give them a
[14:52] little bit extra or whatever not at all
[14:54] it all amounts to something and if you
[14:56] didn't have it you wouldn't be able to
[14:57] give it but they're happy they've come
[14:58] down and they're happy to get something
[15:00] to know that they're loved and you know
[15:02] it's not going to make them
[15:03] but it'll help them and and then of
[15:06] course the young brother that with the
[15:08] church
[15:09] really i don't want to get involved in
[15:11] building churches because amen uh yeah
[15:14] but
[15:16] funnily enough i've always got involved
[15:17] you know
[15:19] yeah
[15:21] i said i didn't want to get involved
[15:23] you know and this year was the same uh
[15:26] brother don don from uh a way over there
[15:28] in uh dingle land it's called just uh in
[15:31] lucon right on the pacific coast lovely
[15:33] place but very open to typhoons and high
[15:36] winds and his little church we went in
[15:38] that night with a lovely meal before we
[15:39] went in but the little church itself was
[15:42] just almost ready to fall down on top of
[15:43] them and
[15:45] you know i looked at it and i took a few
[15:47] photographs and he said we've got land
[15:49] and we would love to build another
[15:50] church and i said well i'll help you to
[15:52] do it i didn't say i would do it i said
[15:54] i'll help you to do it
[15:56] and uh you know that's that's ongoing
[15:58] now i i put i put about a third of the
[16:01] price and and uh somewhere in there
[16:04] i would help with a few others and we're
[16:06] hoping that the rest even from the camp
[16:07] meetings well we'll get up or wherever
[16:09] it comes from we'll get up to uh to get
[16:12] that little church now there's many
[16:13] needs about that but in the different
[16:15] places in philippines but this is one
[16:18] where i was there and and so that's why
[16:20] i and he's a lovely lad his wife had a
[16:22] new baby and uh and right now he's in
[16:26] the mountains they walk over the
[16:27] mountains no trails nothing over the
[16:29] little rivers they walk and walk they
[16:31] got the rucksacks until they get to the
[16:33] villages where they're way up in the
[16:34] mountains nobody knows anything about
[16:36] them and there they bring this message
[16:39] to the people so you got to applaud that
[16:42] amen and that's that's where he is
[16:44] that's where he is right now amen so i
[16:46] think it's a worthy cause there amen
[16:48] praise the lord indonesia
[16:50] uh it's 200 million muslims but very
[16:53] quickly because i want to move on fast
[16:55] but um in indonesia there's 200 million
[16:59] muslims but they're like america how
[17:02] many people are at church today in
[17:03] america
[17:04] let's say for a figure i don't know
[17:05] brother we'd say six million okay well
[17:08] what about the other 295 or six million
[17:11] where are they today you know and see so
[17:13] that's the way it is that's the way it
[17:15] is
[17:16] over there they belong to the muslim
[17:18] denomination and maybe they'll go at
[17:21] ramadan or something like that but the
[17:22] rest of the year they just live like
[17:25] like any denomination so i'm glad about
[17:27] that because if that wasn't the case
[17:28] probably the bride would be more
[17:30] persecuted but you can get the little
[17:32] places where
[17:33] they are there and they're not being
[17:34] persecuted and i'm glad for that praise
[17:37] the lord i'm glad for that and while we
[17:39] were there uh there's two churches
[17:42] and the brother that we go with uh uh
[17:45] say pray young uh he's a lovely brother
[17:48] and a lovely group of people uh just the
[17:50] last day before i came back to bangkok i
[17:53] i got a little tommy upset you know i
[17:55] was drinking some
[17:56] uh what a cucumber juice and ice i don't
[17:59] know if you've ever drunk that before
[18:00] but i never had you know but that night
[18:02] i just felt a little bit and they were
[18:04] having a prayer service and i i said
[18:06] look just
[18:08] give me a mess here tonight because uh
[18:10] i'm flannel tomorrow i want to rest up
[18:12] and be up so all the young people came
[18:14] over to the pastor's house after the
[18:16] service to see me and say goodbye and it
[18:18] was packed believe me it was packed with
[18:20] young people and uh it was lovely that
[18:23] they've got that love for you and uh we
[18:26] really really love them and so uh there
[18:29] that church is doing well it's growing
[18:31] and then we flew down to uh pick em baro
[18:34] baru it's called and brother danny will
[18:37] tell you about these places too and just
[18:39] outside there about 100 kilometers a
[18:41] little place where i couldn't even take
[18:43] you to today ever had to but that's the
[18:45] way it's been with god you know all my
[18:48] life i've been to places where i
[18:49] couldn't even take you back to amen but
[18:51] it's the people we've reached the people
[18:54] we've got right in there with the people
[18:55] and we had a wonderful time there a few
[18:57] people had come in and uh we had
[18:59] wonderful services and we bought tasty

[19:09] and i was telling brother samuel about
[19:11] the young girl 14 she wanted to be
[19:13] baptized she just wanted to be baptized
[19:16] and her parents thought she's too young
[19:17] but she she wanted to be baptized so she
[19:19] asked the pastor they asked the pastor
[19:21] and he said if you really want to you
[19:23] may and i'll tell you what she was happy
[19:25] when she was baptized so i was wonderful
[19:27] and and the girl with the little baby
[19:29] she had phoned up to be baptized today

[20:02] wanted their marriages rededicated in
[20:04] the name of the lord jesus christ and we
[20:06] were able to do that and that's it so

[20:22] business and your pastor's business and
[20:24] the minister's business is the work of
[20:26] the lord jesus christ hallelujah that
[20:28] that we know about amen and that's where

[25:34] time now uh and certainly in this
[25:36] afternoon i'll come at a different angle
[25:38] but this is just to me this is just a
[25:40] sunday morning meeting amen praise the
[25:42] lord i don't promise to preach into the
[25:44] rapture i wish i could amen because i
[25:46] have a good word brother dick hey man if
[25:48] i could do it this morning we'd be
[25:49] raptured this afternoon you know but we
[25:51] just got our portion amen i know brother
[25:54] samuel has been teaching these things
[25:55] and we talked about it last night and
[25:57] even he said something last night that
[25:58] i'll not even be able to cover today
[26:00] it's a very very full chapter but it is
[26:02] a wonderful chapter amen and hard i came
[26:05] to think about it brother weed was very
[26:06] simple uh i was thinking about the
[26:09] acceptable year of the lord
[26:11] the acceptable year of the lord amen and
[26:13] you know maybe there's some people here
[26:15] today
[26:16] if you say they accept that what would
[26:17] that actually mean well that is the year
[26:20] of jubilee
[26:21] that's what the acceptable year of the
[26:22] lord is and that's exactly what the lord
[26:24] jesus came to proclaim
[26:26] liberty throughout the land a year of
[26:28] jubilee the gospel had come hallelujah
[26:31] and all the types and shadows don't
[26:33] matter nothing anymore amen we've got
[26:35] the reality of the promise in the lord
[26:38] jesus christ amen so um
[26:41] really in in this chapter and i want to
[26:43] tell you some nice things here but
[26:46] notice that it starts off with the law
[26:48] of the land that's the general title uh
[26:51] the law of the land and it is the
[26:53] sabbatic year of rest
[26:56] amen that they were told every seven
[26:58] years rest the land
[27:00] now all i can say and i was looking at
[27:02] our little i know the brothers were over
[27:03] and uh uh israel a good few years ago
[27:06] now brother samuel but amen all i can
[27:09] say is thank god for israel today
[27:12] hallelujah they are playing their part
[27:15] as we are playing our part uh we are
[27:17] then the ruth she is the naomi
[27:20] hallelujah and she's right there in the
[27:22] land where she ought to be and even
[27:24] during the conflict there that you've
[27:26] been reading about or whatever not
[27:27] listening on the radio amen that at the
[27:31] height of it
[27:32] there was 900 jews returned to jerusalem
[27:34] not one week
[27:36] even at the fighting going on hard
[27:37] they're in gaza so they weren't going to
[27:39] turn away and run away and say oh we're
[27:41] not going there it's too rough they were
[27:43] there why were they there amen and so if
[27:46] i may say this i had the honor to talk
[27:50] to a soldier on the phone who had been
[27:52] hurt in gaza
[27:54] amen his name is jeremy he's training to
[27:57] be a rabbi but i'll tell you what he's
[27:59] got a good lot of revelation about him
[28:01] amen not as deep as ours of course not
[28:03] but there he was with his platoon down
[28:05] there in gaza amen standing up for what
[28:08] anybody would have done hallelujah don't
[28:10] you men tell me that when the british
[28:12] were coming amen and that that fella
[28:15] that was riding on his horse and the
[28:16] british are coming don't you tell me you
[28:18] wouldn't run to get your uh minute man
[28:20] you would have been there hallelujah
[28:22] you've been saying well no no no we're
[28:24] we don't want that anymore we're
[28:25] standing hey we'll die here hallelujah
[28:28] fighting or we will see liberty in this
[28:30] land
[28:31] amen so praise god they're the same over
[28:34] there and i said to him i said germany
[28:37] may i say to you
[28:39] i am that you weren't killed in gaza
[28:41] and we do feel sorry for the children
[28:43] all killed amen we knew that but like
[28:45] it's like the ambassador said to the u.n
[28:48] if you do not fire one more rocket we'll
[28:50] not fire anything back on you i mean
[28:52] folks we know that and i'm not not going
[28:54] to go into that but it was wonderful
[28:56] just to talk to him amen and praise the
[28:59] lord to realize that we are
[29:03] just in a few days
[29:05] uh earlier this year
[29:07] maybe two months ago uh my i bought a
[29:11] tree two trees one for my wife and one
[29:13] for myself
[29:14] and uh they are planted now they're
[29:17] planted in the land of israel
[29:19] amen now within a few short days
[29:23] israel has gone into this sabbatic year
[29:26] it's called the shemitah year and i'm
[29:27] not very good at hebrew pronunciation
[29:29] it's called the shemitah year and from
[29:32] uh just about uh coming into september
[29:35] right about this time uh might even be
[29:37] in the uh late august but i'm not sure
[29:39] exact date but that year starts and they
[29:42] ain't going to plant nothing for a whole
[29:43] year
[29:44] amen and and and and when you get into
[29:47] this year hallelujah uh the submitter
[29:50] year
[29:52] you know when you look at the captivity
[29:54] uh
[29:55] of israel and babylon and you know it's
[29:58] wonderful that that god actually tells
[30:00] you why he led them into captivity now
[30:02] we know we can say well if you're asking
[30:04] the children they turned away from the
[30:05] lord they wouldn't keep his commandments
[30:07] they were worshiping
[30:09] the sun god and and pale and all what's
[30:11] the woman were crying for thomas that
[30:13] nimrod you know all this thing but
[30:16] really you go into second second
[30:19] chronicles 36 19 and and it says i i
[30:22] don't know if the brother can put that
[30:24] up there the house of the lord is born
[30:26] the wall of jerusalem broken down the
[30:28] people in captivity and it is to fulfill
[30:31] the word of the lord
[30:33] that was spoken jeremiah until the land
[30:36] enjoyed her sabbaths
[30:38] for as long as she laid desolate she
[30:41] kept sabbath to fulfill three score and
[30:44] ten so it was all to do with the land so
[30:47] god says they're not going to keep the
[30:49] sabbath so i'll make them keep it
[30:50] hallelujah i'll they'll be in captivity
[30:52] and that lawn will rest for 70 years
[30:55] amen
[30:56] and then he'll return unto them
[31:00] again praise the lord
[31:01] 70 years 10 sabbath rests amen and
[31:04] jewish tradition is always taught that
[31:06] to go into exile is a penalty for
[31:09] idolatry absolutely uh you know idolatry
[31:14] that's why they went into captivity amen
[31:17] that was the penalty of it before god
[31:19] that's they've always kept that
[31:20] tradition amen
[31:22] and uh and for neglecting to keep the
[31:24] laws of the shemitah year well this year
[31:27] that nation what other nation in heaven
[31:29] under this earth today it's going to
[31:31] keep that
[31:32] and you know the the i'll get into it
[31:34] later on because i've got to hit it
[31:36] because it's in the scripture here uh
[31:37] but i i i you know they're actually a
[31:40] lot of the farmers are worried you know
[31:42] modern worry well how are we going to do
[31:44] it what how are we going to make it but
[31:46] you know in this chapter 25 if you care
[31:48] to go home and read it yourself you'll
[31:50] see how they're going to make it
[31:52] hallelujah and i was able to tell the
[31:54] people we brought the fruit trees off
[31:56] they were voicing their concerns but i
[31:59] answered them back and said i'll tell
[32:00] you how you're going to make it god is
[32:03] going to bless you because you have
[32:05] honored his word hallelujah and you
[32:08] cannot honor god's word without god
[32:10] blessing you
[32:11] that's a fact of life hallelujah so
[32:14] that's a truth amen so that's how god's
[32:16] going to do it but it's right in here in
[32:18] this chapter amen and
[32:20] this this shemeta year amen uh praise
[32:23] the lord uh in 2001 there was was that
[32:27] shemeta year amen where we had the twin
[32:30] towers there's always something happens
[32:32] during these years at 2008 the economic
[32:36] collapse that that really nearly
[32:38] bankrupt ireland
[32:40] we were nearly bankrupt people amen now
[32:42] you know what bankruptcy means it means
[32:44] that you wake up the next day the banks
[32:47] are closed you don't get your pensions
[32:49] through the the police force aren't
[32:51] being paid or the the civil servants uh
[32:54] the public's uh purse is closed and i'll
[32:56] tell you you were in a bad pickle when
[32:58] you're there and we came very close to
[33:00] it but thank god uh we we missed that
[33:03] but it was in that year and of course
[33:06] i'm not going to preach on the blood
[33:08] moons or anything this morning but
[33:10] listen praise the lord we are entering
[33:13] into this year of rest so you know when
[33:14] you get into september the jews are
[33:16] resting their land
[33:17] from september to september amen and
[33:20] praise the lord in this in this time
[33:22] limit
[33:23] on the 13th of september amen praise the
[33:26] lord you're going to find that there's
[33:28] going to be the feast of trumpets
[33:30] the face of trumpets uh that's when the
[33:33] year starts the year of rest then the
[33:35] face of trumpets now what's the feast of
[33:37] trumpets to do simply because i want to
[33:39] keep it simple is to in gather israel
[33:42] amen the calling of the jews that 900
[33:45] hallelujah coming over
[33:48] because they've been called hallelujah
[33:50] something has called them amen and
[33:52] they're coming together for that and and
[33:54] that'll go right in uh
[33:56] to the year 2015
[33:59] and in the year 2015 the first event is
[34:02] going to be
[34:03] an eclipse of the sun
[34:05] the sun is going to be darkened amen
[34:07] that's the first thing i think it's in
[34:09] the third month and so you look out for
[34:11] these events the sun is going to be dark
[34:13] and then when you get in to uh when you
[34:16] get into the month of april hallelujah
[34:19] you are going to see your blood moon
[34:21] again
[34:22] amen hallelujah uh the moon will turn to
[34:25] blood and then after that amen you'll
[34:28] find that um it will go right over to
[34:30] the feast of tabernacles and it's just a
[34:33] wonderful what what we're saying is for
[34:36] all these events to happen in a shemitah
[34:38] year
[34:39] very very rare
[34:41] and and you know uh brother samuel knows
[34:43] we're not trying to teach new doctrine
[34:45] or nothing like that we're just trying
[34:47] to tell you that our redemption is drawn
[34:49] nigh hallelujah that i'll tell you we we
[34:52] we can all talk about the economy and we
[34:54] can all talk about what the devil we're
[34:56] losing our rights left right and center
[34:58] you can't say god bless you hardly to
[35:00] someone outside and they want to see you
[35:02] can't say that you know i mean you know
[35:04] it's not that bad isn't it you know but
[35:07] but we see all these things but also we
[35:09] see our promise this morning and that is
[35:11] wonderful praise the lord so you just be
[35:14] aware of these things you know and
[35:16] brother branham said in the message
[35:17] shalom he said it's the sins of the
[35:19] world getting between the sun and the
[35:20] moon that's causing it to go red so
[35:22] there you are the sins of the world have
[35:24] piled up amen before god amen they
[35:27] surely have that you know and then
[35:30] after the passover it will all end up in
[35:32] the feast of tabernacles amen which was
[35:35] where they built the little booths that
[35:37] they had remember that they come out of
[35:39] egypt but praise the lord with the
[35:41] promise that they come out to go back
[35:43] into the promised land amen into the
[35:45] millennial reign of jesus christ so that
[35:48] is wonderful and i did give the uh
[35:50] brothers uh
[35:52] some scriptures as we're looking at that
[35:54] seven year rest because it's right here
[35:56] in the chapter uh amen i couldn't resist
[35:59] looking at that and in exodus 21 you'll
[36:02] read about what happens in that that
[36:03] seven year span that if a a a man would
[36:07] buy a hebrew servant six years amen he
[36:10] would serve him but the seventh he could
[36:11] go out free so that was a wonderful
[36:13] thing and if you're a servant over there
[36:16] you know you can go out free next year
[36:17] if you know you're if you know the bible
[36:19] you can go
[36:21] next year amen and notice i don't want
[36:23] to go into every last little issue of
[36:25] that because i want to get on but uh you
[36:28] know if he did not want to leave his
[36:29] master you see he could be brought in
[36:32] there and the all would mark his ear and
[36:36] he would serve him forever so brother
[36:38] branham puts that like like that you
[36:40] know there's so many people today they
[36:42] don't want to leave their master maybe
[36:44] their baptist master or their
[36:45] pentecostal master they're happy with
[36:48] well the bible might say that but we we
[36:50] teach you know well i'll tell you what
[36:53] let the year be an old hallelujah and
[36:55] let them be there for that's the way
[36:56] they'll they'll be uh amen they'll
[37:00] they'll meet the lord amen so but that
[37:02] that tells you about that as well noy
[37:04] the year of jubilee the seven asabus

[37:24] uh to the 50th year of the year of
[37:26] jubilee amen now this is very important
[37:29] you see this is the things i want you to

[37:54] amen one day he will blast it praise god
[37:57] and it will be on the the tenth day of

[38:02] that happens folks i tell you they are
[38:04] coming to their day of atonement amen
[38:07] they are coming to the day of atonement

[38:31] month what would that mean amen and uh
[38:34] well in the old testament brother
[38:35] branham says he talks about the the the
[38:37] numerology and you know uh the threes
[38:40] you know and the perfection there and uh
[38:43] the water and the blood and the spirit
[38:45] and you could go on father son holy

[38:51] the pentecostal jubilee of release and
[38:53] we know that amen
[38:55] and so uh he says that uh his numerals
[39:00] of god is perfected or is in perfection
[39:03] so when god speaks it and i'm glad
[39:05] hallelujah brother richard i might never
[39:07] understand every little uh dot and come
[39:09] of it all but i'll tell you what i know
[39:11] when god speaks it that will come to
[39:13] pass
[39:14] that will come to pass no matter if i've
[39:16] got every daughter come or not amen and
[39:18] so when you look at the the numerals you
[39:20] know let me just
[39:22] take you up to 10 fma number one numeral
[39:24] a god that's god the beginning
[39:27] hallelujah the source the first the
[39:29] unity hallelujah not three gods but one
[39:32] god amen one as the first hallelujah and
[39:36] he is certainly the first amen to his
[39:38] witness as we know uh the two witnesses
[39:41] moses and elijah a nerd of the mouth of
[39:43] two or three witnesses you see so two is
[39:46] testimony he sent them out two by two
[39:49] and they had a testimony praise god and
[39:51] certainly god has not stopped hallelujah
[39:54] i i had a woman she was testifying of of
[39:57] what had happened to her and i was
[39:59] looking at that woman i couldn't
[40:00] understand the word she was saying she
[40:02] was speaking in indonesia but i could
[40:04] see the character on her face hallelujah
[40:06] and i'll tell you i said i know that god
[40:08] touched that woman as she was testifying
[40:11] about her she had been healed amen
[40:13] and then a three as we said perfection
[40:16] amen and then right on during the earth
[40:18] the creation the four seasons of the
[40:20] wind uh are all yeah the and and the
[40:24] four corners of the earth the four
[40:25] cherubims it's all to do with uh with
[40:28] the earth there amen uh the four four
[40:30] number five we know is grace we have
[40:32] five wise virgins we've got the five
[40:34] ministries is right uh to perfect the
[40:36] saints sister peggy that's exactly right
[40:38] and then amen six is the number of man
[40:41] and that's the day that uh he had
[40:44] finished and he rested on the sabbath
[40:46] and the beast and the satanic 666 and
[40:49] you know you could go deeper into it
[40:51] i've studied it my people love it but i
[40:52] haven't done it for a year or two they
[40:54] love the numerals when you've got a
[40:56] sunday morning to take them into 13 or
[40:59] whatever number it is and i'll tell you
[41:01] what there's not a saint in the bible
[41:03] that comes under 13. but i'll tell you
[41:06] nimrod does judas does amen the
[41:09] antichrist does oh 13 amen and so it's
[41:12] wonderful to know that even in the
[41:14] numerals god has set it forth amen i
[41:17] suppose you could run too far with
[41:18] things but just as god says it that's
[41:21] the place to leave it amen and and then
[41:24] of course seven is completeness amen and
[41:27] it was to be
[41:28] in the seventh month
[41:30] so it was going to be complete just like
[41:32] our church ages i don't think if i said
[41:34] to anybody oh i can't wait to get into
[41:36] the church if church is you don't be
[41:38] saying where's he coming from amen
[41:40] because we know there's not going to be
[41:42] a church ages hallelujah we know that so
[41:44] we're just rejoicing that seven is
[41:47] complete amen and we're in the last one
[41:49] hallelujah and he called it amen for the
[41:52] the the age of the bride as well as the
[41:54] age of ludicia and i'm glad hallelujah
[41:57] because i don't want that luducian
[41:58] spirit on me amen i want the spirit of
[42:00] god on me i believe we can live in uh
[42:03] there's a kind of glory every day
[42:05] hallelujah and that's where i live
[42:06] people that's where i want to live amen
[42:09] every day in the presence of god amen no
[42:12] matter what am i who i made in the world
[42:15] or anything else that's how i want to
[42:16] live and that's how you ought to want to
[42:18] live as well praise the lord let your
[42:20] life speak more than your words amen so
[42:23] seven is complete amen he rested on the
[42:25] seventh day and it's mentioned over 600
[42:28] times in your bible the seventh amen and
[42:31] so remember that it was in the seventh
[42:33] month amen then if you go on in
[42:35] numerology it's just very quickly here
[42:37] uh you find that it is new beginnings
[42:39] amen when you come seven plus one is it
[42:42] and so that's the lord brought in a new
[42:44] beginning hallelujah with the
[42:46] resurrection amen and it is the number
[42:48] of resurrection and
[42:50] seven and and noah one makes eight
[42:53] people a new beginning hallelujah a new
[42:56] heaven and a new earth coming on the
[42:59] eighth day amen not the seventh day and
[43:02] uh but on either is that right amen
[43:04] praise the lord and of course the value
[43:06] of the name of jesus is idiot amen so
[43:09] that's completeness isn't it new
[43:10] completeness there and then nine is uh
[43:14] completeness fullness
[43:16] of of um of the gifts uh there's nine
[43:19] gifts of the spirit amen and uh fullness
[43:22] thereof god couldn't give you any more
[43:24] than that and i just want to say this
[43:26] that
[43:27] i would not like to go to the mission
[43:29] field without knowing that i've got
[43:31] every gift every tool that i've got in
[43:32] my locker amen because i know i'm going
[43:35] to meet the devil somewhere hallelujah
[43:37] and i've met him praise the lord and
[43:39] he's a rough customer but you know
[43:40] something hallelujah when you've got the
[43:43] word and you know where you're standing
[43:44] you can tell him to back off and he
[43:46] backs off amen he really does so uh
[43:49] that's never funded any different than
[43:50] that and i can also say to you this
[43:53] morning that i've never seen god filling
[43:55] me amen even i was telling one of the
[43:58] brothers this morning brother aaron i
[43:59] believe it was you know when i come back
[44:00] from the the tour brother samuel uh this
[44:03] year uh
[44:04] going through them countries and um
[44:07] you know i come back and i said well
[44:09] lord uh the kitties
[44:12] almost empty you know but you know
[44:13] something i wasn't even back hardly five
[44:16] minutes and the kitty started to fill up
[44:17] again
[44:18] amen and i didn't do it i wasn't crying
[44:20] or pleading or nothing it's just that
[44:22] started off with my sister i went up to
[44:24] her house and you know and and just as i
[44:26] was leaving she says i want you to have
[44:28] that and i said but you don't you know
[44:29] it's okay she didn't know she said i
[44:31] want you put that to the work of the
[44:32] lord you know and i said okay you know
[44:34] and and that was it started hallelujah
[44:36] and then we went over to scotland and
[44:38] they'd look up took up a missionary
[44:39] offer you know i could fly anywhere in
[44:41] the world right now
[44:43] if the lord led me to sister i'll tell
[44:44] you tomorrow i could do it you know so
[44:47] my eyes aren't on that but i tell you my
[44:49] eyes are on the god that provides
[44:51] hallelujah the jehovah jarrah that's
[44:54] where my eyes are and it's wonderful we
[44:56] don't have to worry about it or struggle
[44:58] with it whatever god wants and i mean it
[45:00] i am very very serious that a brother
[45:03] samuel said brother george you know we
[45:04] can't take it up the day whatever
[45:06] reasons you know i just say amen
[45:08] and i'm telling you i would mean it amen
[45:11] i would mean it because our eyes aren't
[45:13] on anything but our eyes are on the lord
[45:16] and whatever way he does it and we're
[45:17] just so thankful okay so that's the the
[45:20] fruit of the gifts of the spirit the
[45:21] fruit of the spirit nine uh nine months
[45:24] as you know when the fruit is the fruit
[45:26] of the womb then you get the ten the
[45:28] reason i'm telling you this is because
[45:30] it was on there uh the seventh month and
[45:32] it was on the tenth day and ten in the
[45:35] bible is law an order it's government
[45:38] it's restoration amen that's why you've
[45:40] got ten commandments and not eleven of
[45:41] them if you want you can add that one if
[45:43] you you want but you know what i mean
[45:44] moses was giving them ten and daniel had
[45:47] the ten toes we know that and the the
[45:49] toes themselves the the the the main
[45:52] ones was christian eisenhower he said
[45:55] praise the lord and uh i nearly said
[45:57] something there but i'm not sad about at
[45:59] least when you're driving down the
[46:00] highways it says eisenhower whatever you
[46:03] know the little thing uh commemorating
[46:06] that that's what he did if he left you
[46:07] nothing else he left your highways
[46:10] and thank god for that that's all i can
[46:12] say thank god for for like amen that if
[46:15] he i'm sure he left other things he was
[46:17] a good president i know that when he was
[46:19] dying that they called up broly graham
[46:21] amen and obviously he was concerned
[46:23] about his soul amen i don't know but
[46:25] about the president incumbent if he'll
[46:27] be concerned about his soul or not but
[46:28] that's his business amen it's not mine
[46:30] but i know that i clear off that
[46:32] hallelujah it's nice to leave something
[46:34] right it's nice to leave something amen
[46:36] praise the lord no
[46:38] and uh there's so many things but amen
[46:41] so that's what it is and uh even in the
[46:43] temple of solomon you had 10 lampstands
[46:45] amen 10 lamb stands the law the order
[46:48] and you'll find that in there in the
[46:50] temple amen and the government and
[46:52] restoration so that's what 10 means amen
[46:55] so it was going to be completeness but
[46:57] there was going to be law and order
[46:59] about this day hallelujah amen and i'm
[47:02] going to stop the numerology there but
[47:03] that's why i did it to show you that the
[47:05] 7 and 10 the seventh month the 10th day
[47:08] and you'll remember it completeness is
[47:10] the is the seventh day and the tenth
[47:12] month is law and order and and
[47:15] government and restoration and that's
[47:17] what's going to happen to israel when
[47:19] they come to their day of atonement
[47:20] hallelujah no okay let's go on a little
[47:22] bit and i'll watch up there i got such a
[47:24] lot here that's my problem
[47:27] that's always my problem
[47:29] my brother canada you know when i get
[47:30] started into it
[47:31] it's so so rich you know i get so many
[47:34] blessings studying the word of god for
[47:36] for the church services and sure samuel
[47:38] and we do the same and other brothers
[47:40] that preach here amen so amen god runs
[47:43] his message his message is like that

[47:47] proclamation of liberty throughout the
[47:49] land this is what this was all about a
[47:51] jubilee on to you the release are going
[47:53] up the freedom you are free to go back
[47:56] to your inheritance amen you know as i
[47:59] said earlier it must have been wonderful
[48:01] when they rang the liberty bell now you
[48:02] might not heard that personally but you
[48:04] knew what was wrong the word would have
[48:06] spread right over hey they've rung the
[48:08] liberty bell and and philadelphia

[48:12] standing now we're going to stand for
[48:14] our liberty hallelujah our freedom and

[48:25] birth of freedom
[48:27] well how much more the children of god
[48:30] amen to enter into the acceptable year
[48:33] of the lord hallelujah for he who the
[48:36] son sets free is free indeed
[48:39] amen so it's wonderful now i just very
[48:42] quickly because there's some things
[48:44] brother branham said about it but
[48:46] amen and and i i i'll say this if i may
[48:49] that most of my messages are you just
[48:53] have to type in what i say and you'll
[48:55] get up on your computer you'll get up
[48:57] where it's coming from so you'll see
[48:59] that amen and then i know i can't be
[49:01] wrong when i'm quoting it the prophet
[49:03] said because we believe what he said is
[49:05] the truth now so the law of the land if
[49:08] you read that in chapter 17 from verse
[49:10] 14 to 17 the law of the land it's all
[49:13] about the law of the land and there was
[49:15] no oppression by commercial dealings
[49:17] they said fear god reverence him for he
[49:20] says i am the lord your god so that
[49:22] means we should be honest people
[49:24] hallelujah praise god what a thing to be
[49:26] honest amen and god blesses honesty amen
[49:30] no shitty dealings no nothing like that
[49:32] and uh amen and verse 18 to 19 the
[49:35] obedience brings safety the land will be
[49:38] prosperous and verse 20 to 24 they're
[49:40] saying well what shall we eat in this
[49:42] amount of year what are we going to eat
[49:44] you see what how are we going to do it
[49:45] and verse 21 is what i quoted back to to
[49:48] israel amen the divine promise of
[49:51] multiple blessings of the sixth year to
[49:53] suffice until the third year
[49:56] after when they start to grow again
[49:57] after the shimada year and then
[50:00] hallelujah they will see amen so in the
[50:03] eighth year and reaping the ninth year
[50:06] and it will bring what god says and i
[50:08] believe with all my heart that god will
[50:09] bless
[50:10] the land of israel that are obeying this
[50:13] word hallelujah amen and today and of
[50:17] course we obey as well back home has

[50:34] of his inheritance a brother can redeem
[50:36] him okay i'll say more about that later

[59:04] behind a holy table i'll face god for
[59:06] this what i'm going to say to you right
[59:07] now but you know something when he was
[59:09] preaching there i i almost just slipped
[59:12] because you know the dimensions are so
[59:13] close the edges are so close and so fine
[59:16] and brother deck i did as he was
[59:18] preaching i just slipped hallelujah
[59:21] where i felt something

[59:42] brother i love him hallelujah i feel the
[59:44] love of god for him amen

[59:50] praise the lord i wish i could i could
[59:52] read it all right to you but tame would
[59:54] not allow me to do that that because i
[59:55] wrote it down amen about recognizing the
[59:58] presence of god hallelujah a lot of
[1:00:00] people don't recognize it but when you
[1:00:02] can recognize it hallelujah know you're
[1:00:04] in his presence and that's what it was
[1:00:06] where we just slipped there and it was
[1:00:08] wonderful
[1:00:09] and you know i felt this love for the
[1:00:12] people and and and and also i felt no
[1:00:16] condemnation
[1:00:18] no condemnation
[1:00:19] it was just beautiful i felt ageless
[1:00:22] brother
[1:00:23] i did i felt ageless i didn't feel a
[1:00:25] creature of time as brother branham
[1:00:27] talks about that you know i'm not saying
[1:00:29] i was over there because i didn't see
[1:00:31] anybody uh to talk of but
[1:00:34] myself i was changed i was there
[1:00:38] just like that that's how i felt amen
[1:00:41] and and it was wonderful and and the
[1:00:43] peace that was there
[1:00:45] it was just hard to describe i can't
[1:00:46] tell you how long i was in it it could
[1:00:48] have been moments or a minute or
[1:00:50] whatever but you know it was real to me
[1:00:53] hallelujah and you know something just
[1:00:55] seemed to say to me at the end of it all
[1:00:57] that's how it's going to be in the
[1:00:58] millennium
[1:00:59] wow you'll feel ageless you'll feel no
[1:01:02] condemnation you shouldn't even feel it
[1:01:04] today hallelujah you know there's
[1:01:06] nothing to condemn you hallelujah the
[1:01:09] god you're accepted in the beloved amen
[1:01:12] it's all gone it's all washed away he's
[1:01:14] dealt with our sins amen when they were
[1:01:17] nailed to the tree he has dealt with our
[1:01:18] sins
[1:01:20] and it's a wonderful place to be a
[1:01:21] wonderful place to be hallelujah so i i
[1:01:24] i do feel sorry for people maybe some
[1:01:26] people even going to watch us that
[1:01:28] believe they're going through the
[1:01:29] tribulation now if they believe that
[1:01:31] hard enough that's where they'll go but
[1:01:33] i'll tell you what
[1:01:35] that's right if you believe it hard
[1:01:36] enough amen and you're convinced well
[1:01:39] that's exactly where you'll go and when
[1:01:40] you get there you'll say amen we were
[1:01:41] right
[1:01:43] but
[1:01:44] amen but i'll tell you what we'll be in
[1:01:45] the glory
[1:01:47] we'll be in the glory that's where we're
[1:01:48] going amen the bride hallelujah is
[1:01:51] judged hallelujah in christ jesus we are
[1:01:54] accepted in the beloved we are made the
[1:01:57] very righteousness of god in christ this
[1:01:59] morning
[1:02:00] hallelujah you might understand that but
[1:02:01] i'll tell you what to say amen
[1:02:03] because that's the truth
[1:02:05] amen right all right all right and so
[1:02:07] the blood was put on the mercy seat
[1:02:09] we're talking about the day of atonement
[1:02:10] when this jubilee would be sounded the
[1:02:13] blood shed on the mercy seat one of
[1:02:14] these little goats had to die amen then
[1:02:17] it was
[1:02:18] shared outside on the other goat and the
[1:02:20] priest took it outside you've got all
[1:02:21] that in chapter 16 amen and and it's a
[1:02:24] wonderful thing and brother brown said
[1:02:26] that was your seven church ages the
[1:02:28] blood being
[1:02:29] shed for that and then amen that little
[1:02:32] scapegoat that's what it was called and
[1:02:34] here he was taken out and released with
[1:02:36] the blood of his meat
[1:02:38] that had died and brother branham just
[1:02:40] simply
[1:02:41] says amen that this is christ he is both
[1:02:45] them goats hallelujah so that's why i
[1:02:48] say when we can can look at it
[1:02:49] spiritually we see christ being the one
[1:02:52] that was chosen to die and the one that
[1:02:55] bore our sins outside the camp
[1:02:58] hallelujah so we're so thankful for that
[1:03:00] this morning amen but christ become a
[1:03:03] high priest as hebrews 9 if he can flick
[1:03:05] that up for you a high priest amen of
[1:03:08] the good things to come by the greater
[1:03:10] and more perfect tabernacle amen uh not
[1:03:13] made with hands that is to say not of
[1:03:15] this building neither by the blood of
[1:03:17] goats and calves but by his own blood he
[1:03:21] hath entered in once into the holy place
[1:03:24] having obtained
[1:03:25] eternal salvation for us
[1:03:28] we ought to be folks hallelujah you
[1:03:31] ought to be hopping in your seat this
[1:03:33] morning praise god you ought to be
[1:03:35] huffing and saying what hallelujah
[1:03:37] eternal salvation yes amen praise god
[1:03:41] we're not going to live for the
[1:03:42] millennium and say well folks i'm sorry
[1:03:44] you all gotta die now and you're
[1:03:46] obliterated you say what i thought this
[1:03:48] was only starting oh no i forgot to tell
[1:03:50] you there's a new heaven a new earth a
[1:03:52] new city a new jerusalem it's not only
[1:03:55] here in the millennium you're going into
[1:03:57] that as well oh wonderful eternal praise
[1:04:00] god it's wonderful well let me just go
[1:04:02] pop on over here you know
[1:04:04] when you look at the day of atonement it
[1:04:06] was one of the seven faiths i don't
[1:04:07] wanna linger on this but just to give
[1:04:09] you a little idea the passover as you
[1:04:11] know was typical of christ our pastor
[1:04:13] were dying for us amen we need a lamb we
[1:04:16] need a sacrifice when we find god's uh
[1:04:19] amen
[1:04:20] god's place of worship his only place of
[1:04:22] worship that is jesus christ our lord so
[1:04:24] we know that amen i did and i shouldn't
[1:04:27] really say this but i i did preach a
[1:04:29] message it's always been a real blessing
[1:04:31] to me brother weird and when brother
[1:04:32] branham says amen
[1:04:34] the word interpreted
[1:04:36] the word interpreted as a manifestation
[1:04:39] of the name of god
[1:04:41] hallelujah so when you look at all the
[1:04:43] gates there is today and you say well
[1:04:45] how do i know brother which is the right
[1:04:47] git well just then what brother bottom
[1:04:49] says and if you get the right
[1:04:50] interpretation you'll get the right gift
[1:04:52] hallelujah because it will be a
[1:04:54] manifestation of the name of god
[1:04:57] hallelujah and that's exactly what it is
[1:05:00] a manifestation of the name of god the
[1:05:01] lord jesus christ there's your gift
[1:05:03] right there you don't need any argument
[1:05:05] about it you know somebody may turn
[1:05:06] around and say well i we we believe in
[1:05:09] our church it has to be in the name of
[1:05:10] the father son and holy ghost
[1:05:12] interpret the word that jesus said right
[1:05:14] there
[1:05:15] and it has to be a manifestation of the
[1:05:18] name of god it's the name of the father
[1:05:19] son and holy ghost the manifestation of
[1:05:21] his name amen is certainly not his name
[1:05:24] as the lord jesus christ did peter have
[1:05:26] it amen right there wherever you're
[1:05:28] listening to this did peter have it on
[1:05:30] the day of pentecost don't ever try and
[1:05:32] tell me he didn't have it on the day of
[1:05:33] pentecost ten days before he had a
[1:05:36] resurrected jesus christ and he never
[1:05:38] even bothered to tell him that you're
[1:05:39] going to preach a false doctrine and the
[1:05:41] first day of the church is born amen
[1:05:43] folks you don't don't hallelujah you
[1:05:45] just don't do it amen hallelujah he had
[1:05:48] thus set the lord on the day of
[1:05:49] pentecost
[1:05:50] praise god amen sure did why because
[1:05:53] that word interpreted was a
[1:05:55] manifestation of the name of jesus
[1:05:57] christ that's why and that's how you
[1:05:59] know it just put it to the test the
[1:06:01] unleavened bread is communion with
[1:06:03] christ amen i'm not going to say anymore
[1:06:04] because you could stop anywhere here but
[1:06:06] i want to push on real hard and yeah and
[1:06:08] then the the first fruit say amen a type
[1:06:11] of the resurrection praise the lord that
[1:06:13] he has become the first fruits of them
[1:06:15] that slept he was the first one on many
[1:06:18] he shall bring with him amen and you
[1:06:20] could say more in these things i'm just
[1:06:21] running them down and then the feast of
[1:06:23] pentecost which was the anti-type there
[1:06:26] of the descent of the holy spirit uh on
[1:06:29] the day of of pentecost amen when he
[1:06:31] come down into the church amen
[1:06:34] hallelujah so we we know all about that
[1:06:36] amen and that was 50 days i want you to
[1:06:39] keep that in mind that was 50 days after
[1:06:42] amen the feast of the first fruit
[1:06:44] 50 deaths amen then the feast of the
[1:06:46] trumpets which was uh uh it refers in
[1:06:49] future to the regathering of israel
[1:06:52] brother branham wanted to preach
[1:06:54] the seven trumpets and he wondered why i
[1:06:56] could never just hit it right until it
[1:06:58] was shown to them amen it's not far to
[1:07:00] church it's for israel hallelujah you
[1:07:03] know i mean as much as we want to know
[1:07:04] about these things i ain't going to be
[1:07:06] here hallelujah amen so but i know
[1:07:09] they're going to have their trumpets
[1:07:10] hallelujah and i know they're going to
[1:07:12] have that seventh that a day of
[1:07:14] atonement trumpet is going to sign for
[1:07:15] them hallelujah like this trumpet will
[1:07:18] sign for us amen now and then of course
[1:07:21] you have the day of atonement which
[1:07:23] we've just described to you there's
[1:07:24] actually there was a more of it there
[1:07:26] about um they had a a a bullock as well
[1:07:30] you know and that was where the the
[1:07:31] finger was stepped seven times but you
[1:07:33] can read it hallelujah but it's all a
[1:07:35] type of christ all a type of christ amen
[1:07:38] no i and and the feast of tabernacles of
[1:07:40] course a memorial prophetical a reminder
[1:07:43] as to the redemption out of egypt
[1:07:45] prophetical as to the kingdom rest of
[1:07:47] israel after her end gathering and
[1:07:50] restoration and i tell you what god's
[1:07:52] word does not miss it hallelujah you
[1:07:56] know his brother samuel last night was
[1:07:57] explaining to us you know and and when
[1:07:59] you look at all the years amen and and
[1:08:02] the way man have changed it all around
[1:08:04] but i'll tell you when you see it there
[1:08:06] hallelujah with your red glasses on amen
[1:08:08] it all fits in amen and so that's one
[1:08:11] thing i'd never do is ever try to tell
[1:08:13] god he's wrong
[1:08:16] do you say amen to that hallelujah you
[1:08:19] know whatever it is don't you tell him
[1:08:20] he's wrong hallelujah and i'll tell you
[1:08:22] what friends and i mean this sincerely
[1:08:24] you know when moses was up the mount and
[1:08:26] they started to play around down there
[1:08:28] getting false gods and all the rest of
[1:08:29] it you know he just came down the
[1:08:31] mountain and he said who is on the
[1:08:32] lord's side
[1:08:34] who's on the lord's side now i might say
[1:08:35] a bit more about that later on he said
[1:08:37] let him stand by me
[1:08:39] come on here right by me and there'll be
[1:08:41] two camps and if you're here with me on
[1:08:43] the lord's side hallelujah then we'll
[1:08:45] see what's going to happen
[1:08:47] so you've got to stay with the word
[1:08:48] you've got to stay with the prophet the
[1:08:50] message hallelujah that's been delivered
[1:08:52] because if you believe it's got flaws in
[1:08:54] it then
[1:08:55] you look at the word of god there's
[1:08:57] flaws in it that's nonsense hallelujah
[1:08:59] it's because you don't understand it
[1:09:01] enough that you'll come out with it like
[1:09:03] that well the year of jubilee the
[1:09:04] acceptable year of the lord amen praise
[1:09:07] the lord did you notice brother branham
[1:09:09] said we have some of the same customs
[1:09:11] jesus he read the scriptures and
[1:09:13] business teaching on the scripture amen
[1:09:16] it was contrary sometimes to what the
[1:09:17] jewish people thought it was but yet you
[1:09:19] could and who could accuse him he was
[1:09:21] the lord of glory hallelujah and we read
[1:09:23] in isaiah he uh anointed me to preach
[1:09:26] the acceptable year of the lord amen now
[1:09:30] hallelujah this day this word has been
[1:09:33] fulfilled in you amen so many times
[1:09:36] years before the event god speaks it
[1:09:38] amen and the lord spoke it but he says
[1:09:41] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:09:44] what a glorious thing it is for that
[1:09:46] amen and and just say that uh
[1:09:49] he says here uh amen now the acceptable
[1:09:53] year of the lord uh and this during this
[1:09:55] time between so many years the
[1:09:58] acceptable year
[1:09:59] is the year called in the old writings
[1:10:01] the year of jubilee amen
[1:10:04] jesus had the greatest anointing of any
[1:10:06] man that was ever on earth is that right
[1:10:08] one day he went into the temple he
[1:10:10] picked it up and he read it hallelujah
[1:10:12] and the lord preached the acceptable
[1:10:14] year of the lord to the captives
[1:10:16] amen a jubilee if you weren't in
[1:10:19] captivity well it would mean nothing to
[1:10:21] you but when you were in sin and you
[1:10:23] were born in sin like i was born in sin
[1:10:26] hallelujah but when you heard a message
[1:10:29] that jesus christ had died for you and
[1:10:31] you came in repentance hallelujah man
[1:10:33] you come into your jubilee right now yes
[1:10:35] you did hallelujah you heard a trumpet
[1:10:38] sign
[1:10:39] amen you heard a trumpet sign amen and
[1:10:41] so when he speaks preaching this here
[1:10:43] the trumpet sign the jubilee the priest
[1:10:45] come in and that priest earned it
[1:10:48] amen and you could drop your hole praise
[1:10:50] the lord the devil had no part over you
[1:10:52] that day
[1:10:53] hallelujah no you were born a son you
[1:10:55] were a son amen like the prodigal was a
[1:10:57] son amen he was his father's son
[1:10:59] hallelujah but you know something uh he
[1:11:02] wasn't in his father's will eating pig's
[1:11:04] food
[1:11:05] what father would give his son pigs food
[1:11:07] i don't know what hallelujah amen but
[1:11:10] this guy he went that way but he he
[1:11:12] realized he came to his correct senses
[1:11:14] and he came back to the father's house
[1:11:16] amen so so that's where it is and we
[1:11:18] heard the trumpet sound hallelujah and
[1:11:22] and we could drop that hole and walk
[1:11:24] right into christ amen and and you know
[1:11:26] the devil couldn't stop us
[1:11:28] he could not stop his brother hallelujah
[1:11:30] amen we were free indeed amen from that
[1:11:33] and we're so glad this morning now the
[1:11:36] sounding of the jubilee when we heard
[1:11:38] the sound and it was a joyful sign you
[1:11:40] know we've often sang that song that
[1:11:42] you've heard the joyful sign jesus saves
[1:11:45] jesus seems that's a joyful sign amen
[1:11:48] hallelujah and it is not an uncertain
[1:11:50] sign and you know there might be some
[1:11:52] people even in here today praise god you
[1:11:54] started to come to church and you're not

[1:12:08] guy would hold up i'll just take a
[1:12:10] little zipless
[1:12:12] and thank you and he would hold up a tin
[1:12:14] of paint
[1:12:15] and he's not going to give a big spool
[1:12:17] about it he just says it does what it
[1:12:20] says on the 10. you got that it does
[1:12:23] what it says on the 10. hallelujah and
[1:12:25] and that's right and you know this is
[1:12:27] when you come to the gospel it does
[1:12:29] exactly what it says in the book amen
[1:12:32] hallelujah if you come up for him it
[1:12:34] will do exactly what it says in the book

[1:12:42] doing it many many times
[1:12:44] over yes i never stops healing people
[1:12:47] that's it's just in his nature he's a
[1:12:48] healer and he he paid the price so no
[1:12:50] matter what i'm carrying today i know
[1:12:52] that he was wept to the very bone
[1:12:55] that i could be healed hallelujah amen
[1:12:57] and that's what we believe amen now i

[1:14:26] the trumpet there and who preached it
[1:14:29] christ and you just type that into your
[1:14:30] computer and it'll come up exactly where
[1:14:33] where he said that that you know and
[1:14:34] it's wonderful they owed a debt that

[1:14:48] in the debtors and one owed them a lot
[1:14:49] of money and the other one wrote him a
[1:14:51] little bit less or whatever not but he
[1:14:53] forgive them both then the man that came
[1:14:55] back and said hold on a minute you know
[1:14:57] you forgive him
[1:14:59] and what about me you know

[1:15:02] forgiven but you're not both debtors
[1:15:04] amen it's up to me i can forgive who i
[1:15:06] will so that's a wonderful thing in
[1:15:08] other words you may have sent great
[1:15:10] great sins but i'll tell you what he can
[1:15:12] reach down to the lowest hell hallelujah
[1:15:15] you might have been brought up in a
[1:15:16] christian home hallelujah you never
[1:15:18] learned a curse in school and and and
[1:15:20] you know you learned honesty in your
[1:15:22] home hallelujah but you realize that in
[1:15:24] your little heart there was still that
[1:15:26] sin hallelujah but he still forgives you
[1:15:28] as well as he can forgive the harlot in

[1:18:46] wonderful amen when when when lincoln

[1:18:53] but that didn't free anybody they were
[1:18:55] still under under the the slavery thing
[1:18:57] but you know when that amendment i don't

[1:19:15] hallelujah the wall city brother branham
[1:19:17] just says this and i've got five more
[1:19:19] minutes or so and i'll be on there i
[1:19:20] think from when i started but the wall
[1:19:22] city brother brother said that's the
[1:19:23] trouble today you've got people all in
[1:19:25] the walls today now of course you think
[1:19:28] about it
[1:19:29] if it sounded outside amen you mightn't
[1:19:32] hear it in the wall city
[1:19:33] and he says today amen actually what is
[1:19:37] happening is that people are living in
[1:19:39] wall cities and they don't hear the
[1:19:41] sound
[1:19:42] they don't hear that certain amen and
[1:19:44] praise the lord uh amen he said that's
[1:19:48] that's your denominations you can live
[1:19:50] in a wall city and you can say no i
[1:19:52] don't believe that amen but our church
[1:19:54] teaches us well you're in a wall city
[1:19:56] i'll tell you what and one day i think
[1:19:58] you'll regret that hallelujah one day
[1:20:00] amen so i praise the lord now listen to
[1:20:03] this amen
[1:20:05] okay ah and and uh and azusa street the
[1:20:08] pentecostal jubilee i like this what
[1:20:10] brother bradham said about that he said
[1:20:12] god pulled his elected church out of
[1:20:15] them denominations 50 years ago
[1:20:19] god pulled out that remnant he said this
[1:20:23] is the jubilee he's calling again return
[1:20:27] jubilee 50 years ago god pulled them out
[1:20:31] and tonight he said he's trying to do it
[1:20:34] again so god wants his art of the system
[1:20:37] art of the denomination art of the
[1:20:39] spirit of the world out of the spirit of
[1:20:42] of of antichrist hallelujah and the his
[1:20:44] spirit amen and we're free and we're
[1:20:46] free indeed and i love that to be in
[1:20:48] this place today i really do hallelujah
[1:20:51] and i if i may just because i've got a
[1:20:52] few little things here uh to say before
[1:20:55] i finish up amen from the pentecostal
[1:20:58] feast to the
[1:21:00] the day of atonement it was the longest
[1:21:02] stretch longest stretch of time amen and
[1:21:05] uh you know it says that uh in the book
[1:21:08] of acts after the ascension and the
[1:21:10] crucifixion
[1:21:11] amen uh from from there the day that the
[1:21:14] lord raised from the dead amen then the
[1:21:16] pentecost was 50 but then from from
[1:21:18] pentecost to the day of atonement amen
[1:21:21] and uh the outpouring of the holy spirit
[1:21:23] that brought in our church kids that's
[1:21:25] actually that's actually where there'll
[1:21:26] be such a gap because god uh finished
[1:21:29] dealing with the jews and we got our
[1:21:31] chance thank god hallelujah amen thank
[1:21:33] god we got our chance because folks you
[1:21:36] do not realize when god turned around
[1:21:38] and said amen that we were without hope
[1:21:41] and without god
[1:21:43] i'm a third hope in this life
[1:21:45] amen my my what a place we were in
[1:21:48] what a place we were in but you know
[1:21:50] thank god that he had mercy on the
[1:21:52] gentiles hallelujah and not only mercy
[1:21:54] brother joe but he brought in a gentile
[1:21:57] bride hallelujah not even like a jewish
[1:22:00] bride to sit with him there uh
[1:22:02] as the queen but a gentile bride
[1:22:04] hallelujah and that's us and i'm
[1:22:06] thankful for god for that tonight amen
[1:22:09] we're not servants we're sons hallelujah
[1:22:11] we're friends amen as we said before
[1:22:15] that when john our our
[1:22:17] representative put his head here he
[1:22:20] could hear the heartbeat of jesus christ
[1:22:22] and jesus told him the secret of that
[1:22:24] moment that it would be judas that would
[1:22:26] betray him amen so that's where we are
[1:22:28] we've got the ear of the master because
[1:22:30] he's our husband today i preached uh i
[1:22:33] never had preached on adonia before amen

[1:23:00] may and you know when brother branham
[1:23:02] talked about the holy spirit coming he
[1:23:04] said and today
[1:23:05] that's what he's doing he's waving his
[1:23:07] word over us you know you would be
[1:23:09] surprised if you knew what was happening
[1:23:12] to you today that the word of god is
[1:23:14] going forth hallelujah you're amen in
[1:23:16] the word and you'd be surprised what
[1:23:18] it's doing on your inside hallelujah
[1:23:20] amen no i okay i maybe just hit that a
[1:23:23] little bit later on amen what is going
[1:23:26] on on the inside praise the lord so come
[1:23:28] expect an amen and uh okay and and
[1:23:31] brother brahma said he said from that
[1:23:33] time the people around the world are
[1:23:35] having a jubilee shouting the victory
[1:23:37] now okay
[1:23:40] the pentecost started the church heads
[1:23:43] and we know that loducion church when
[1:23:44] the last seat is in that'll finish the
[1:23:46] church age no more but after that then
[1:23:49] you'll find that the jews as we go end
[1:23:51] of the rapture the jews will be
[1:23:53] maneuvered in amen into their time
[1:23:55] hallelujah and i will see that it's all
[1:23:58] for one reason as far as god's concerned
[1:24:00] and that will be to get them to their
[1:24:02] day of atonement amen to get them to
[1:24:04] what we what we and only this time

[1:25:24] sabbaths uh the pentecostal jubilee the
[1:25:27] weaving of the sheaf the resurrection
[1:25:29] and then uh the outpouring of the holy
[1:25:31] spirit and then
[1:25:34] right up to the feast of trumpets that's
[1:25:35] god's order that's what he said in order
[1:25:37] not me not brother you're not blood or
[1:25:39] weird amen but i'll tell you that's what

[1:26:17] servant we know that as brother branham
[1:26:19] and praise the lord then israel goes to
[1:26:22] their feast of atonement so that's all
[1:26:24] in there in chapter 16 he says amen now

[1:27:30] we will be gone amen we will be gone we
[1:27:33] we gotta go that they can move in amen
[1:27:35] and it'll be to israel the gentiles will
[1:27:37] be shot out in darkness amen and it's
[1:27:40] almost there and i i i'm sure you can
[1:27:42] say amen this morning when i say this
[1:27:45] and you don't look i was talking to an
[1:27:47] israeli ambassador and we had a
[1:27:49] wonderful
[1:27:50] supper with him an evening meal up in
[1:27:53] donegal where i live and his wife was
[1:27:55] there and he was there all his security
[1:27:58] was away down somewhere else and it was
[1:28:00] just him and my family and i thought
[1:28:01] that was one of the highlights ever that
[1:28:03] god would give me is to have the israeli
[1:28:06] ambassador
[1:28:07] at my table amen and that night we had a
[1:28:09] wonderful time and i said to him you
[1:28:11] know i said mr ambassador i or just
[1:28:14] ambassador i said
[1:28:16] i wish
[1:28:17] that i could tell you
[1:28:19] your hard days are over
[1:28:21] i said but i cannot
[1:28:23] i said jacob's trouble has yet to come
[1:28:26] but it will come
[1:28:27] but god will deliver them out of it
[1:28:29] hallelujah that's wonderful god will
[1:28:32] deliver him out of it so they have to
[1:28:34] come the pentecostal they said the being
[1:28:37] prophets they believe they'll believe
[1:28:39] him calling them to the feast of
[1:28:41] atonement letting them recognize christ
[1:28:43] and and that's the way it's going to be
[1:28:45] just exactly the way the word says it's
[1:28:46] going to be and they'll recognize christ
[1:28:48] amen wounded in the house of my friends
[1:28:50] now and and closing off and we we talked
[1:28:53] about these things last night a little
[1:28:54] bit
[1:28:55] seventy uh there's a brother over in
[1:28:57] ireland and he's over in scotland and
[1:28:59] he's turning 70 in september and i said
[1:29:02] well that's a good number because 70
[1:29:05] in the bible is the number prior to
[1:29:08] increase amen the number when you hit 70
[1:29:11] after that it's increased hallelujah
[1:29:13] amen
[1:29:14] so
[1:29:16] you look forward to whatever you want
[1:29:17] with
[1:29:18] but i'll tell you why
[1:29:21] i've been waiting a long time to be
[1:29:22] increased you know but it is amen
[1:29:25] because after they come out of the
[1:29:26] captivity praise the lord they went into
[1:29:29] increase again amen god blessed the land
[1:29:31] and they had left idolatry behind them
[1:29:33] amen no so god a jubilee every 49th year
[1:29:37] the 50th year was the jubilee we talked
[1:29:39] about the church ages there a little bit
[1:29:41] and i want to say this this morning
[1:29:43] because i know i've got the freedom to
[1:29:45] sit here but listen amen so we
[1:29:47] understand that from the first jubilee
[1:29:50] leviticus 25 it in 1977
[1:29:54] uh will be the seventh jubilee
[1:29:57] now i'll tell you what i ain't gonna
[1:29:59] argue without brother samuel that's what
[1:30:01] he said hallelujah amen if i believe the
[1:30:03] message praise god and and when when i
[1:30:06] had that that dream of brother branham
[1:30:08] he said just brother brother preach the
[1:30:10] word that is my message hallelujah so he
[1:30:13] said that i believe that that makes a
[1:30:15] 70-year jubilee a 70th jubilee three
[1:30:18] four three oh years means that going up
[1:30:20] the release did you get that god will
[1:30:23] deal with us exactly the same amount of
[1:30:24] time that he dealt with the jews now
[1:30:26] brother samuel can explain that all to
[1:30:28] you amen and break it all down for you
[1:30:30] but i'm just saying it as he read it
[1:30:32] there hallelujah and we believe that uh
[1:30:34] abraham the promise until the rejection
[1:30:36] of the messiah 80 33 was one nine five
[1:30:39] four years and i know he went through it
[1:30:41] with you and so and i believe it what
[1:30:43] he's taught hallelujah and so amen uh
[1:30:45] right unto the
[1:30:47] we've got 17 years left now until 77
[1:30:51] which will be the seventh jubilee since
[1:30:52] the beginning of jubilees
[1:30:54] and oh brother watch close night don't
[1:30:56] miss it it'll be the jubilee of the
[1:30:58] going up of the gentile bride and the
[1:31:01] return of christ to the jews when they
[1:31:03] go out of their bondage again don't you
[1:31:06] say for all the world they'll gather for
[1:31:08] that day hallelujah so we know that you
[1:31:10] say hold on brother i was 77. amen so we
[1:31:14] are now in 2014. well you know brother
[1:31:16] dick i am a simple man praise the lord
[1:31:18] and i love country people hallelujah
[1:31:21] amen and i'm a simple man and you say
[1:31:23] how do you explain that well let me just
[1:31:25] put it like this i know your posture is
[1:31:27] split far deeper and brother where i
[1:31:29] know he can't do that but just i would
[1:31:31] just put it like this brother branham
[1:31:33] said if it does pass 77 it will squeeze
[1:31:37] awful hard to get through
[1:31:39] and it has squeezed awful hard to get
[1:31:41] through i i do believe that god could
[1:31:43] have done anything in 1977 but we're
[1:31:46] still here and in my little humble way
[1:31:48] saying it we're in the delay amen i know
[1:31:51] with the years and times and and all
[1:31:53] that there your pastor can do that and i
[1:31:55] can accept that hallelujah but i'll tell
[1:31:58] you what we're just in the delay there's
[1:32:00] nothing more to be fulfilled hallelujah
[1:32:02] amen nothing more there's no grit
[1:32:04] nothing's coming we are ready hallelujah
[1:32:07] for a body change
[1:32:08] ready for a body tunes and you know uh
[1:32:11] you should be praying that every day you
[1:32:12] get up out of your bed hallelujah it
[1:32:15] could be the day this could be the hour
[1:32:17] amen and so that's all i would call it
[1:32:19] amen and this is just winding down i
[1:32:22] praise the lord just wind it up all
[1:32:23] finished amen and now in the days of
[1:32:26] solomon anybody knows when god sent his
[1:32:28] gifts to the world the world receives it
[1:32:30] the church receives it then it's a
[1:32:32] golden jubilee well i'll tell you what
[1:32:34] then that means the brides and the
[1:32:35] goldens you believe today hallelujah for
[1:32:37] we have received the word of our day
[1:32:40] we've received the revealed word of our
[1:32:42] art amen and thank god for that
[1:32:44] hallelujah he talks about russia and
[1:32:46] this is very briefly because it failed
[1:32:48] to receive the jubilee message of the
[1:32:51] baptism of the holy ghost russia he said
[1:32:53] they've turned over to a rapid mind what
[1:32:56] i said earlier and i never finished it
[1:32:58] you're born to see
[1:33:00] outside souls that are in prison now
[1:33:04] i'll tell you what if you've got any
[1:33:06] spirituality about you you've seen souls
[1:33:09] that are in prison nine and you could
[1:33:11] never get them out of that prison like
[1:33:14] the man that was in the wall city and he
[1:33:15] got his ear bored to to the master he
[1:33:17] loves the devil hallelujah he'll never
[1:33:20] hear it he never you'd be wasting your
[1:33:22] breath hallelujah the bible said don't
[1:33:24] cast your pearls before a swine that's
[1:33:27] what you would be doing they're wrapped
[1:33:28] up in mines hallelujah they're all there
[1:33:30] the man of sin
[1:33:32] it's all there that spirit is moving but
[1:33:34] the spirit is moving in us as well
[1:33:36] hallelujah praise god he is and i love
[1:33:38] it and i'll tell you what there's
[1:33:40] nothing like this work of god amen and
[1:33:42] and he said now brother america has 40
[1:33:45] years of old fashioned apostolic
[1:33:47] preaching the jubilee year and it won't
[1:33:50] receive it as a nation
[1:33:52] that's your country and how much i have
[1:33:54] loved america amen not loved it enough
[1:33:57] to come and live here but loved it
[1:34:01] yeah
[1:34:02] you don't believe me so you don't hey
[1:34:03] man
[1:34:05] i'll tell you i was talking to a little
[1:34:07] little woman the other day there brother
[1:34:09] david farmer you know him well i'm sure
[1:34:10] he lives up in virginia and i was
[1:34:12] talking to his daughter and she said uh
[1:34:14] brother george could i ask you about
[1:34:16] about your uh health system
[1:34:18] and i said yes and she started asking
[1:34:21] questions so my wife was in hospital
[1:34:23] when she nearly died because the the the
[1:34:26] ovary had infected you know the and the
[1:34:28] cyst and it was very very touch and go
[1:34:31] but i'll tell you what god spurred her
[1:34:33] and she's still there god bless her and
[1:34:34] we love her dearly and you know the
[1:34:36] thing is
[1:34:38] that uh when we were talking about that
[1:34:40] she was in she was in intensive care for
[1:34:43] ages really was
[1:34:45] and uh so then she was in the whole
[1:34:47] hospital for a month
[1:34:49] and when i got the bill it came to 450
[1:34:52] euros
[1:34:53] which let's say 600.
[1:34:56] so you go into hospital here for a month
[1:34:58] and stay in the intensive care life at
[1:35:00] 600
[1:35:02] that would be i'm that would be for your
[1:35:03] entrance fee into the hospital
[1:35:05] so so i know all about it you know but
