[39:00] about 2 hours and a half I was trying to
[39:02] cut it down I I was shooting for 2 hours
[39:05] but it went a little bit further but we
[39:06] had a wonderful time enjoyed everything

[39:10] all the the gathering together and
[39:13] everything like that and uh they uh I

[40:19] nothing out of cater so it must mean
[40:21] that we're the ones that's out of cater
[40:23] Lord so you just help us in whatever it

[40:36] as we read your word now you come and
[40:38] speak to our hearts and guide us now in
[40:40] Jesus name
[40:44] amen and we've been reading this for a
[40:47] while but we kind of Switched Off a
[40:49] title for La for watch not service and
[40:53] we'll use the same one today uh this
[40:56] will be part two cuz I want to make sure
[40:58] that we understand what I'm trying to
[41:00] bring of the making known of God
[41:04] and the revelation of Jesus Christ which
[41:07] God gave unto him to show unto his
[41:10] servants things which must shortly come
[41:12] to pass and he sent and signified it by
[41:15] his Angel unto his servant John who bear
[41:18] record of the word of God and the
[41:19] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[41:21] things that is saw blessed is he that
[41:24] readeth and they that hear the words of
[41:25] this prophecy and keep those things
[41:28] which are written therein for the time
[41:31] is at hand remember we preached the
[41:33] message on it what the time when the
[41:36] true revelation of Jesus Christ which is
[41:40] a revelation of the entire Bible is a
[41:42] revelation of Jesus Christ when that's
[41:45] made known then it's time to understand
[41:48] it's time to get out of here too okay
[41:50] Romans
[41:51] 8 we just
[41:53] read Verse 18 and 19 for I reckon that
[41:57] the sufferings of this present Day
[42:00] present time excuse me are not worthy to
[42:02] be compared with the glory which shall
[42:04] be revealed in us for the earnest
[42:07] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[42:09] the manifestation of the sons of God you
[42:13] may be seated the Lord at his Blessing
[42:15] to the reading of the word now there
[42:17] yeah go ahead and just put that up now
[42:19] we
[42:21] have to you that was not here on the
[42:24] watch Night Service we have some extra
[42:27] copies of the notes and things of the uh
[42:32] quotes that we used on the message
[42:37] there trying to bring out what we
[42:40] believe now I'm uh I told you I'm a
[42:44] little horse so just depend I mean just
[42:47] you know kind of help me by praying for
[42:49] me but uh you know don't clear your
[42:51] throat cuz I'll have enough trouble
[42:53] clearing mine and uh but we'll try to
[42:56] get into the word and I want to make
[42:58] sure that you understand what I'm
[43:01] talking about because I ventured into uh
[43:05] trying to explain there uh Friday night
[43:10] some things that I have
[43:12] mentioned along the way spoke a little
[43:16] bit about it but would back up and uh
[43:19] trying to wait to a time that uh you
[43:23] know that we could understand and I
[43:26] believe that now now Now's the Time to
[43:28] understand so you know we keep on going
[43:31] all
[43:32] right now we read here in the scriptures
[43:34] that the whole world is waiting for the
[43:39] manifestation of the sons of God now
[43:42] that's plural that's not One Singular
[43:45] the world wasn't waiting for quote now
[43:48] just brother
[43:49] branam to come right the world is
[43:53] waiting on a manifestation of sons of
[43:55] God and we believe he was was a
[43:57] manifested Son of God all right now we
[44:00] believe that we believe that that God
[44:03] used him to speak to us right all right
[44:06] and we've tried to make oursel clear
[44:08] about where we stand that we are not
[44:11] looking for another Messenger to come
[44:13] amen if you are you better get to
[44:14] digging because time's running out and
[44:17] you're getting older you know why cuz I
[44:19] know that cuz I'm getting older I mean
[44:21] that's easy to understand so we need to
[44:24] get on with it if we're trying to find
[44:25] something else or or whatever and and do
[44:29] whatever because time is running out but
[44:32] now I I spoke many times along this line
[44:36] to to do it but I want to just make sure
[44:38] you understand this little Point what is
[44:42] manifestation see when you say
[44:45] that automatically people thinks of
[44:48] healing signs and
[44:51] wonders Miracles right because that's
[44:55] our human words and thoughts all right
[45:02] but how would that work out when
[45:09] uh well Jesus never come to make himself
[45:13] known that's what I was trying to get
[45:14] across Friday night he came to reveal
[45:18] the father or make known the father so
[45:21] the entire Bible now listen to the way
[45:23] I'm saying it please the entire Bible is
[45:26] the revelation of Jesus Christ all right
[45:29] I gave you a lot of quotes on that you
[45:31] should know where the Prophet said it
[45:33] all right now then I believe Jesus
[45:35] Christ is almighty God Amen all right
[45:39] now that's not
[45:40] Oneness we'll get to that in a minute to
[45:43] try to show the point that's not a
[45:45] Oneness Doctrine right Amen brother
[45:47] brand said I I don't agree with the
[45:49] Oneness right he said I believe in true
[45:53] Oneness amen that's right and I do too
[45:57] but I don't believe in the Oneness
[45:58] Doctrine but neither do I believe in the
[46:00] Trinity I was reading there one uh this
[46:02] morning where brother R said I I'm not a
[46:05] Oneness and he said I'm not a trinity he
[46:07] said I'm a Christian amen that's a good
[46:10] way of putting it wasn't good right amen
[46:12] you know he said I'm a Christian all
[46:14] right now see because we look at the
[46:18] Bible and try to comprehend and as I
[46:21] said Wednesday night I mean Friday night
[46:23] there then all we can use is words
[46:27] right that's right when you say the word
[46:30] Eternal you in your mind have made that
[46:34] something when really it is not anything
[46:38] because how could it be anything that be
[46:39] Eternal right amen it would have to be
[46:42] the Eternal God right but see when we
[46:45] make an eternity out of it we we're
[46:48] making it into human words we say it's
[46:50] like a circle it has no beginning and no
[46:53] ending you've made it a thought in your
[46:56] mind
[46:57] right because what you're trying to do
[46:59] is Express into words what your
[47:02] spiritual part of you
[47:05] sees right you agree amen see then what
[47:09] what we do is we take words and we we
[47:11] mess up things because immediately when
[47:13] you speak you mess it up but see Jesus
[47:16] didn't come to make himself known that's
[47:19] right and he to whom the son Matthew
[47:22] 11:25 through 27 he to whom the son will
[47:26] reveal
[47:27] amen now he come to reveal the father
[47:30] according to the prophet in the church
[47:31] age book that's 332 of the church age
[47:34] book that he didn't come to make known
[47:36] the son didn't come to make himself
[47:37] known he come to make the father known
[47:40] amen right
[47:43] now making known then did Jesus just
[47:46] come into the world doing signs and
[47:51] wonders no he became he came into the
[47:54] world preaching the
[47:55] gospel and God done the signs and
[47:58] wonders cuz he said I can do nothing
[48:00] right amen until the father shows me
[48:03] right he said what I see the father
[48:05] doing like I told you there the other
[48:07] night when we was on it that brother
[48:09] Brown said when that little woman he
[48:10] said now be it unto thee according to
[48:13] according to your understanding not
[48:14] according to your faith he said God
[48:16] didn't reveal to him that woman was
[48:18] healed right is what your Prophet said
[48:21] that's right amen he didn't reveal that
[48:23] that she was healed said Jesus told her
[48:25] to put it on her own faith right
[48:27] huh he said but then when Lazarus was
[48:30] raised he said that was a different
[48:32] thing because he'd seen a vision he know
[48:35] exactly what is going to take place
[48:36] that's right see because that's that's
[48:38] what it's got to be but he never came to
[48:41] make Jesus never came to make himself
[48:44] known right he came to make it make the
[48:47] father known right that's why to me then
[48:50] the prophet would say that it's a
[48:53] complete Revelation and listen I I look
[48:55] up everything back in on
[48:57] brother said a complete revelation of
[49:03] Jesus he uses those eight times all
[49:06] right but it's about 30 something times
[49:08] 20 something times that he says that the
[49:10] Bible is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[49:12] right all right now so it is a
[49:15] revelation of Jesus amen that's
[49:18] fine like I said the other night about
[49:21] it some of you caught it started
[49:22] laughing CU you seen what I saying you
[49:24] know about the things where the prophets
[49:26] said that Moses wrote five books yep
[49:30] right and these two quotes where brother
[49:32] R said Moses wrote four
[49:35] books well you know what Moses wrote
[49:37] four books and Moses wrote five books
[49:40] that's s amen I don't need a revelation
[49:43] does he he wasn't saying it was just
[49:45] four and it was five and he's changing
[49:47] his
[49:48] mind those are not contradiction those
[49:51] are just statements of human people you
[49:55] before the day is over you will do the
[49:57] same thing and I will too because we'll
[49:59] say something that's really not
[50:01] correctly doing it all right but now if
[50:04] Jesus came to make the father known then
[50:08] who are we to make known amen that's
[50:12] right are we to make Jesus known and let
[50:15] him make God known no we're to make God
[50:17] known amen that's right okay and you're
[50:22] a prophet on the message of of
[50:23] manifested sons of God paragraph 22 he
[50:27] said what is making known he said what
[50:29] is manifestation he said make it known
[50:33] right see Jesus made God
[50:36] known that's right and God made him
[50:39] known right right that's simple is it
[50:44] right he made his father known he didn't
[50:47] come to make himself known he made his
[50:49] father known and the father made him
[50:52] known you said but now now brother Dale
[50:55] said you the way you talk a lot times I
[50:57] can't understand you cuz you say you
[50:58] believe in one God and then you say you
[51:00] believe in in in Father Son and Holy
[51:03] Ghost and bless you bless you you tell
[51:08] me how you believe it and put it
[51:09] together with the Bible That's Right am
[51:11] and the prophet's message that's as
[51:13] simple as I say it right all right see
[51:17] if Jesus Christ though was to make God
[51:19] known who are you and I to make known
[51:22] right and see that's what you see people
[51:25] of the message that they think of
[51:26] adoption is making them
[51:29] known adoption glorifies Jesus Christ
[51:32] and if it glorifies Jesus Christ it
[51:34] would have to be making Jesus Christ
[51:35] known now you understand what I say I
[51:37] said it over and over the other night
[51:39] when I say Jesus Christ I'm not talking
[51:41] about Jesus the flesh amen all right you
[51:46] understand I'm talking about Jesus
[51:48] Christ to me Jesus Christ was almighty
[51:51] God the
[51:53] flesh was a body that was created yes
[51:57] all right God lived in that body Soul
[52:00] and Spirit of almighty God lived in that
[52:03] body and that's not one this then right
[52:05] amen that's a true Revelation we'll get
[52:07] down to some more in a minute but now
[52:11] listen see God won't share his glory
[52:14] with no one that's right amen so you see
[52:18] people that are stuffed shirts you know
[52:20] and the things and and they think really
[52:21] the world can't operate without them and
[52:24] and we'll find out one of these days
[52:26] like a prophet said if you want to know
[52:27] how important you are he said stick your
[52:29] hand in a bucket of water and pull it
[52:31] back out and see if you can find a hole
[52:35] you know well if that's what we think
[52:37] about it see I've never tried to believe
[52:39] that hey you know boy I tell you what
[52:42] and God you going to have to leave me
[52:43] here till the Rapture comes now he
[52:44] doesn't have to leave me here cuz he'll
[52:46] raise up somebody to take over I've
[52:49] never been concerned about that part
[52:51] right but I was trying to get the point
[52:52] to you you know that God won't share his
[52:56] glory with
[52:57] nobody that's right amen now
[53:01] listen but what about
[53:05] this almighty God unveiled in
[53:09] 1964 brother brand says God is inviting
[53:12] us to share his glory that's right
[53:15] that's right that's right amen he's
[53:17] inviting us to share his
[53:19] glory you see you make statements
[53:22] brother Dale it confuses my
[53:25] mind no no I made a statement that
[53:27] showed your mind was already
[53:30] confused cuz you thought you had it
[53:31] figured
[53:33] out because he won't share his glory it
[53:36] is not the revealing when I preach about
[53:39] that the bride is part of the mystery
[53:41] and must be revealed I'm not talking
[53:43] about you and me that's right I'm
[53:45] talking about Jesus Christ that's
[53:48] revealed in you and me CU when I'm
[53:50] talking about God revealing himself
[53:53] that's exactly what I'm talking about
[53:56] right
[53:58] we read in Revelations 1 the Revelation
[54:01] that God give to Jesus to give to John
[54:04] and I told you that was the key of the
[54:06] entire Bible right
[54:08] amen shows you how the entire Bible was
[54:11] written the Revelation that God give to
[54:12] Jes what was that Revelation about about
[54:15] Jesus no it was only about his future
[54:18] work in the church right because the
[54:21] Revelation was of God it is about God
[54:24] Amen
[54:27] see you're making the Trinity out of it
[54:28] the Bible's not making it right it's a
[54:32] revelation that God give to Jesus the
[54:35] revelation of who about himself
[54:39] am to reveal to bring
[54:44] out he said well why didn't you say that
[54:46] a couple of weeks ago and it helped me
[54:47] to understand well see the Lord makes
[54:50] you wait until sometimes where it can
[54:51] get us in the right place where we can't
[54:54] understand right there amen see
[54:56] God wants to share his glory with us why
[54:59] because he wants to share his eternal
[55:02] life with us that's right and to
[55:04] manifest himself through us there's
[55:06] nobody in the world that believes in
[55:08] manifestation any greater than I do yeah
[55:13] amen but I also got the Bible what are
[55:17] we going to do you know that John the
[55:19] Baptist never done one Miracle not one
[55:22] amen goad did he make God known amen
[55:28] he certainly introduced him to the world
[55:32] Amen right the greatest the Bible says
[55:35] of the prophets was John the Baptist but
[55:39] they wouldn't one Miracle see we put our
[55:41] things on Miracle then when I start
[55:42] preaching like that Brother D don't
[55:44] believe in Miracle he don't believe
[55:51] manifestation but you
[55:53] see that's what I'm trying to do
[55:56] is to make my father
[55:58] known right that's all I've ever tried
[56:01] to do is to make him
[56:06] known listen to what brother Brown says
[56:08] on this
[56:09] one see I love to bring
[56:14] everything it's actually on the church
[56:16] age
[56:18] book you don't have the notes or nothing
[56:20] now so don't look for it how we long for
[56:24] that day when the Crooked roads will be
[56:27] straightened and we will be with him
[56:30] time Without End May that day hasten its
[56:33] appearance and may we hasten to obey his
[56:36] word and thereby prove our worthiness to
[56:40] share his glory that's right
[56:43] amen prove it by what we do how we stay
[56:46] with the word right I love the way
[56:48] brother around talks you know he he said
[56:50] one time talking about something he said
[56:51] you know God believes his own
[56:53] word well that's that's good Lees his
[56:56] own
[56:57] word because he said it all right but
[57:00] now get the
[57:03] point see we're come to try to make him
[57:06] known not ourselves known right now
[57:09] listen to what I'm saying all right cuz
[57:11] this is the way I just try to make
[57:13] everything
[57:14] blunt you know there's probably not a
[57:16] preacher hardly might be some coups now
[57:19] you know there are cops that try to make
[57:20] their themselves known now so we leave
[57:22] that benefit but the majority of all the
[57:25] preachers were be denominational
[57:27] preachers this message preachers or what
[57:29] if you ask them what would they do and
[57:31] they'd say I'm trying to make my father
[57:33] known well how can you do that when you
[57:35] teach a Trinity
[57:38] right that's how can you do that when
[57:40] you teach that God is Street person or
[57:42] something right you're not making God
[57:45] known you're making the devil known
[57:46] right come on what about the people of
[57:49] the message that say he wouldn't go till
[57:50] the River Jordan that's right are they
[57:52] making God known or the devil known
[57:54] which one it is it amen
[57:56] see you think it's not serious you think
[57:59] that I just pick on people about this
[58:01] that and the other but no that's
[58:05] right God will make you and I known if
[58:08] we'll make him known but he's not
[58:10] underbound to us because of who we
[58:14] are it's because of what we can believe
[58:19] right don't worry about it he'll make
[58:21] you manifest right cuz he's making
[58:23] himself known that's right that's what
[58:25] he come to do amen he come to to make
[58:28] himself known but how did he come that's
[58:31] the only thing I've ever tried to get
[58:32] you to see how did God condescend that's
[58:34] what I'm talking about Friday night how
[58:36] did he
[58:40] condescend he didn't step over as we
[58:42] were looking at it you know now this is
[58:44] added to it so that was the other part
[58:47] God dwelt Alone the self-existing Elohim
[58:51] amen now he just didn't empty this up
[58:54] and step over here and start trying to
[58:55] make make yourself manifest that's right
[58:57] I've tried my best to get you to see
[59:00] that leave that alone you think it's a
[59:02] beautiful drawing to where you can take
[59:04] this and oh God was back there and then
[59:06] he just comes
[59:09] over like a brother told me one time he
[59:11] he was showing me a a drawing this man
[59:14] had and he laid it down on the table and
[59:16] he said oh brother said look at that and
[59:21] it didn't take me but just about 2
[59:22] seconds till I seen it wasn't right you
[59:24] know the drawing and I said my Lord man
[59:27] that thing ain't even
[59:28] scriptural he said but it's a beautiful
[59:31] drawing I
[59:34] said it didn't mean a thing to him right
[59:37] he still held on his beautiful drawing
[59:39] right you make a beautiful drawing and
[59:42] make a beautiful
[59:43] speech but it's your speech in the word
[59:46] right
[59:49] amen but what did God do what is your
[59:51] Prophet we had to go to him to be able
[59:54] to get what was before the world and
[59:56] showed you that there Friday night
[1:00:00] amen and it was probably a shock when I
[1:00:02] first made the quote to you that I said
[1:00:05] Revelations 1 says the Revelation that
[1:00:07] God give to Jesus to give to
[1:00:09] John S signified it by an Angel and I
[1:00:13] said turn over now I didn't do it but I
[1:00:15] said over in Genesis 1 you know what it
[1:00:17] says the Revelation that God give to
[1:00:19] Jesus right and sent it to his servant
[1:00:23] by an Angel to Moses
[1:00:27] right I so he sent it to who wrote
[1:00:32] Genesis said he wrote it I gave you the
[1:00:34] quote said he wrote it from
[1:00:38] inspiration it's easy to know what
[1:00:40] happened in Exodus Leviticus Numbers and
[1:00:44] Deuteronomy because Moses was living
[1:00:46] that and writing down what was taking
[1:00:48] place but Genesis he was writing about
[1:00:51] what happened before the world right you
[1:00:54] know and the world coming down he told
[1:00:56] you about when it wasn't even as a wrote
[1:00:58] out here see time wasn't counted in the
[1:01:00] garden until the fall right even though
[1:01:03] you got days and things but how many
[1:01:05] days you have 7 days or 7,000 years
[1:01:08] which one is
[1:01:11] it time wasn't counted right brother
[1:01:15] said Adam knew that his youth was being
[1:01:18] renewed right other words there was no
[1:01:20] age Factor there was no deterioration
[1:01:22] there was no days and times M until fall
[1:01:26] came into be
[1:01:28] right would you
[1:01:30] see then God the prophet said a little
[1:01:33] Halo of light came
[1:01:36] out he calls it the logos the theoy the
[1:01:40] Son of God
[1:01:42] Amen see when you say son of God people
[1:01:44] lock in 2,000 years ago Son of God Son
[1:01:48] of God was the first form of God that
[1:01:50] ever came into being into a human mind
[1:01:53] that could comprehend right that's it
[1:01:56] amen like I said about Moses he got it
[1:01:59] from God and wrote Genesis but he got it
[1:02:02] from the angel that met him at the
[1:02:04] burning bush that's what your Prophet
[1:02:06] said that's right which was the angel of
[1:02:08] the Covenant which was Jesus Christ
[1:02:12] right that wasn't Jesus At The Burning
[1:02:15] Bush but over in the book of Acts you'll
[1:02:17] find it talking about Jesus Christ and
[1:02:19] it said he was the one that spoke to
[1:02:21] Moses I think it's Act 7 I'm not certain
[1:02:27] do you see what I'm talking about
[1:02:30] yes see we think we
[1:02:34] understand but we don't understand God
[1:02:37] until he reveals it right amen there's
[1:02:39] no way to put it into human language
[1:02:41] right you can't bring into human
[1:02:44] language and eternal God that a human
[1:02:46] mind without the Holy Ghost can reveal
[1:02:48] it right am is that what the Bible said
[1:02:50] no man can call Jesus the Christ except
[1:02:53] what by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:55] what your Prophet said the new
[1:02:58] birth y amen I sitting there in the
[1:03:02] woods listening the other day some
[1:03:03] questions and answer in Genesis you know
[1:03:05] how I've always taught it I said the new
[1:03:07] birth is what Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:03:09] coming into you at one time the person
[1:03:12] of God
[1:03:14] right I sitting there a listen question
[1:03:16] and answer genes brother said you can't
[1:03:18] have the father without having a son he
[1:03:20] said you can't have the Holy Ghost
[1:03:22] without having father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:03:24] he said because it's the same person
[1:03:26] right amen how many persons you got well
[1:03:29] brother we don't have persons anymore we
[1:03:31] have
[1:03:35] identities well according to Webster
[1:03:37] identities is person yeah right and even
[1:03:41] people say well you know great man this
[1:03:44] message says why there's two persons of
[1:03:47] Jesus was a person and God was I
[1:03:49] wouldn't say that if I didn't hear it
[1:03:50] right sure did well see that's contrary
[1:03:52] to the prophet's message but you know
[1:03:54] what you got a big following
[1:03:57] they try to have him at somebody that
[1:03:59] can preach the
[1:04:01] truth well that's all right not no
[1:04:06] problem I preach to what God gives me to
[1:04:08] preach to right
[1:04:10] amen listen we were talking about see
[1:04:14] and we've been on it quite a while in
[1:04:16] the Book of Revelation the Revelation
[1:04:17] that God give to
[1:04:19] Jesus see to give it to John but it
[1:04:22] wasn't the
[1:04:23] revelation of himself
[1:04:26] or Jesus Christ you know as as that it
[1:04:29] was the revelation of what God was going
[1:04:31] to be doing do you understand right
[1:04:35] am well I read it say Revelation Jesus
[1:04:37] Christ how many gods you got then you
[1:04:40] got a revelation of God you got a
[1:04:41] revation
[1:04:42] Jesus I'm not trying to reveal two Gods
[1:04:45] I'm trying to reveal one true and living
[1:04:47] God that's right but his name is Lord
[1:04:50] Jesus Christ that's right one
[1:04:53] God well brother the hell you try to
[1:04:56] make it so so that we can't understand
[1:04:59] it's just simple it's just one God well
[1:05:01] that's what you believe the Baptist
[1:05:02] believe that you want to talk to them
[1:05:05] Baptist will fight you over where you
[1:05:07] tell them there's a Trinity right but
[1:05:10] when they get through like I said a
[1:05:11] minute ago a Baptist preacher get up and
[1:05:13] he said I'm only talking about my father
[1:05:16] trying to reveal him say Well who's your
[1:05:18] father well he's Father Son and the Holy
[1:05:19] Ghost Blessed Trinity but we believe one
[1:05:22] God
[1:05:29] did we according to John
[1:05:36] 1 your Prophet would
[1:05:40] say in the beginning was
[1:05:42] Elohim
[1:05:45] right and Elohim was with
[1:05:49] Elohim and then Elohim was made flesh
[1:05:51] and dwelt among
[1:05:53] us see he translated that word is on the
[1:05:56] unveiling of God he translated the word
[1:05:59] what back to where the original cuz he
[1:06:00] said Genesis 1 where it says God that
[1:06:04] means Elohim
[1:06:07] right
[1:06:08] Y and he self-existing
[1:06:13] right see the Bible is a complete
[1:06:15] revelation of Jesus Christ who is
[1:06:18] almighty God Amen that's right that's
[1:06:21] what I'm talking to you about well that
[1:06:23] sounds like Oneness well okay okay hold
[1:06:26] on a
[1:06:28] minute remember you're prophet and we
[1:06:31] gave it to you over and over and have
[1:06:33] for all of the years we've been
[1:06:34] preaching that what the Son of God is
[1:06:36] God in another form called a son that's
[1:06:40] right same God am same God is here
[1:06:45] self-existing is the same God
[1:06:49] here but what do we bring
[1:06:53] out brother BR say it was only a part of
[1:06:56] God that went out right
[1:07:02] mhm I know what he says he said he was
[1:07:04] all of God that's right cuz you took a
[1:07:06] spoonful of water out of the ocean and
[1:07:08] you got the same chemicals exactly of
[1:07:11] what it is in the whole ocean right but
[1:07:14] you only got it in the part you got the
[1:07:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the
[1:07:18] new birth right which is the person of
[1:07:21] Jesus Christ now I'm quoting brother R
[1:07:24] but do you have all of
[1:07:26] God
[1:07:29] right no but he did what's right cuz he
[1:07:31] didn't have all of God all of God
[1:07:33] wouldn't made manifest what he was doing
[1:07:35] until the River Jordan I agree with
[1:07:37] those Brothers on that that's when he
[1:07:39] become the prophet said the fullness of
[1:07:41] the godhead bodily cuz he couldn't die
[1:07:43] for you at at 3 years old he couldn't
[1:07:45] die for you at 12 years old he couldn't
[1:07:48] die right he couldn't make that manifest
[1:07:51] he could only make God manifest for the
[1:07:53] part that was being di right
[1:07:57] right but the River Jordan it was a
[1:07:59] fullness
[1:08:01] am all
[1:08:04] right see the son then is to make the
[1:08:06] father known how by bringing the father
[1:08:10] into
[1:08:13] view right okay right right by bringing
[1:08:17] the father into view not bringing the
[1:08:19] self into you
[1:08:23] right because it's not God
[1:08:26] is not many
[1:08:30] gods it's one God being revealed that's
[1:08:33] right now listen how many times do you
[1:08:35] need this that God has made manifest in
[1:08:38] what three attributes father son Holy
[1:08:41] Ghost
[1:08:43] amen all right now healer Redeemer
[1:08:47] savior Etc has to be tied up in that
[1:08:50] because you only have the three
[1:08:51] attributes of God Father Son and Holy
[1:08:54] Ghost that's what to be revealed to us
[1:08:56] here now there's parts of God that's not
[1:08:58] been revealed so you better leave that
[1:09:00] on the other side over there where I got
[1:09:02] the line that says eternity you better
[1:09:04] leave something there to be able where
[1:09:05] your Prophet would be right to where he
[1:09:07] said he'd give us the message of cheer
[1:09:09] right amen he said after the angels are
[1:09:12] gone and after we're over there he can
[1:09:14] give us a message of cheer
[1:09:16] right now if not what kind of a g I'm
[1:09:19] just honest I don't mean to be hateful I
[1:09:22] know God has to reveal it but what kind
[1:09:24] of a god do you have
[1:09:26] right like I said Friday night me I mean
[1:09:29] do you think God oh God's just a spirit
[1:09:32] well he was just floating around there
[1:09:34] wasn't nothing he's just floating
[1:09:37] around just no form no well brother R
[1:09:41] said God is a being right amen he's not
[1:09:44] like the wind I gave you that Friday
[1:09:46] night amen he said he's a
[1:09:48] person
[1:09:50] right he said he lives in
[1:09:53] heaven that's right he got a place to
[1:09:56] live don't you think he had a place to
[1:09:57] live before he created the world see we
[1:10:00] get over here and we try to make de you
[1:10:03] know something greater than what it is
[1:10:05] you mean this pullit I'm beating on wood
[1:10:07] is greater than the creator that created
[1:10:10] it that's right what kind of a god do
[1:10:13] you have am even the totem pole people
[1:10:16] believeing better than that they at
[1:10:17] least get them a totem pole set it
[1:10:20] up right but you
[1:10:23] see to me God before the world was God
[1:10:27] Amen I know what it means god is an
[1:10:29] object of worship and he wouldn't he
[1:10:31] made the angels and they worshiped him
[1:10:32] we know all the whole story right but
[1:10:34] who was
[1:10:35] he oh he's just a glob just floating
[1:10:44] around what kind of a God are you
[1:10:46] talking about that's right and what kind
[1:10:48] of a God are you going to see when you
[1:10:51] get over there
[1:10:55] oh I guess what we'll see is we'll see a
[1:10:57] Halo of light up here and a little
[1:10:59] Pillar of Fire over here little Dove
[1:11:01] over here and Jesus walking around well
[1:11:04] I don't believe that man I'm just
[1:11:06] honest I don't believe it that's
[1:11:09] right I believe we're going to see Jesus
[1:11:12] we're going to see him like he said yes
[1:11:14] he said if you seen me you've seen the
[1:11:16] father right that's who we're going to
[1:11:18] see amen yes sir but now before I get to
[1:11:22] the end of the message I hope I get
[1:11:24] there I want to make sure you understand
[1:11:26] one thing you realize that when we get
[1:11:28] there and see him he'll still have nail
[1:11:29] prints in his hands so when I get around
[1:11:32] to a minute in what I'm trying to bring
[1:11:33] out to you don't think that I'm doing
[1:11:36] away with anything I do not believe God
[1:11:41] does away with anything whatsoever
[1:11:43] whatever he was he still is and will
[1:11:46] always be or he's not Hebrews
[1:11:50] 13:8 in him was the attributes he never
[1:11:53] gained attributes when he come here he
[1:11:55] he displayed attributes when he came
[1:11:57] here that's right those attributes was
[1:12:00] in him sir but there was things about
[1:12:03] him he didn't tell us that's right he
[1:12:06] said wait just a minute where you get
[1:12:07] that from your Prophet they said we get
[1:12:09] a messenger Che down through the end
[1:12:11] ages right okay I got it from
[1:12:16] him because that's what I
[1:12:18] believe are we going to go up there and
[1:12:20] look around and say who Where's God no I
[1:12:23] believe we're going to see Jesus Christ
[1:12:25] amen yes and we're going to see him as
[1:12:28] he is amen standing right there in flesh
[1:12:32] amen that's
[1:12:34] right my brother D you just don't
[1:12:38] understand I've always believed God is a
[1:12:42] spirit and you're making it something
[1:12:45] thank you Father Hallelujah you mean
[1:12:47] what created you is not greater than you
[1:12:49] are that's
[1:12:51] right and see that's what I've tried to
[1:12:53] do right I've tried to get get to that
[1:12:55] point now you remember what the three
[1:12:59] attributes of God father son Holy
[1:13:02] Ghost now you remember the many times
[1:13:05] you want me to get them be glad to
[1:13:07] they're in the
[1:13:08] office of where Dr
[1:13:11] lza that was a
[1:13:13] Jew the brother R said he was a Jew he
[1:13:17] was the one who wrote the ls of Bible
[1:13:19] right okay and brother R said that that
[1:13:23] that LS of Bible was
[1:13:25] of he said there's no difference in
[1:13:27] Doctrine or anything than the King James
[1:13:30] right now that's that's not verbatim
[1:13:32] words it's close enough but now Dr lamza
[1:13:37] was shocked he seen the signs and the
[1:13:40] things that brother Brandon was
[1:13:43] doing right right he seen the Miracles
[1:13:46] the healings and the
[1:13:49] things but did that excite
[1:13:53] him I'm trying to get to where you'll
[1:13:55] see what make manifest make known
[1:14:00] is was he excited yes wonderful God Is
[1:14:04] With Us Glory Hallelujah brother
[1:14:08] brandom I believe maybe that you was a
[1:14:14] prophet great signs and wonders to man
[1:14:17] say well what happened to him one day he
[1:14:20] was sitting talking with the prophet
[1:14:25] and brother brandham he said uh you're
[1:14:29] not a Oneness brother
[1:14:31] brandham he said no I'm not a Oneness he
[1:14:35] said I believe in the three attributes
[1:14:36] of
[1:14:40] God three offices he said Dr Lomo said
[1:14:45] you mean like brother R said Father Son
[1:14:48] and Holy
[1:14:52] Ghost Dr Lonzo said brother brandom I
[1:14:56] believed you was a prophet now I know
[1:14:58] you are in other words he said because
[1:15:01] now do you know that that's the ancient
[1:15:04] symbol of one God in the
[1:15:07] Hebrew now I don't know what this line
[1:15:09] is you could draw it out any way you
[1:15:11] will make or whatever I don't know what
[1:15:12] they was talking about back there I
[1:15:14] probably have my own idea of a circle
[1:15:16] with parts and parts I don't know what
[1:15:18] the symbol I've never seen it maybe you
[1:15:20] have right but brother R brother Dr L
[1:15:23] said brother brandom
[1:15:25] that's the Hebrew symbol of one
[1:15:29] God he said now I know you're a prophet
[1:15:32] and he said prophets said one day you'll
[1:15:34] give your life for that he said because
[1:15:37] prophets always died for their belief
[1:15:39] brother Brown said Hallelujah I hope so
[1:15:42] right he saw three attributes brother
[1:15:46] random taught three
[1:15:49] attributes Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:15:55] now then why can't we see three
[1:15:57] attributes with having without having to
[1:15:59] look at three
[1:16:01] persons or some kind of a way why can't
[1:16:04] we see that this eternal God that had
[1:16:06] all of these attributes in
[1:16:09] him he began to display
[1:16:14] attributes right and out of him went a
[1:16:16] pillar of fire out of him went the low
[1:16:19] go out of him went the Son of
[1:16:21] God now brother random said I do not not
[1:16:25] believe in Eternal
[1:16:26] sunship
[1:16:28] right that true
[1:16:30] right so he's not talking about eternal
[1:16:33] sunship whatever who this is right here
[1:16:36] that does all of this has to be Eternal
[1:16:43] right every who the Lo the the word the
[1:16:47] Son of God would have to be
[1:16:50] Eternal wait a minute now you're saying
[1:16:52] Son of God is eternal Prophet said
[1:16:55] well your prophets want have said he was
[1:16:57] sure did
[1:16:58] amen he said that's God in another
[1:17:02] form called a son God in another
[1:17:06] attribute in other words God in
[1:17:10] another revealing of
[1:17:12] itself a way that he could come down we
[1:17:15] can't understand the Eternal God
[1:17:20] right it's been 6,000 years trying to
[1:17:23] preach about what he's made in his word
[1:17:25] for us to understand right and the most
[1:17:28] confused people about the godhead is the
[1:17:30] people of this message amen that's
[1:17:34] right that's right don't back off at
[1:17:38] all the most confused people about the
[1:17:41] godhead I had a better understanding of
[1:17:43] one God and the Baptist Church
[1:17:47] right and the people of this message
[1:17:49] today's
[1:17:50] got cuz you see they won't take all
[1:17:53] brother around and say they only take
[1:17:54] part only take what they want right take
[1:17:57] it
[1:17:59] all brother R said he's all he's part of
[1:18:01] God he said he's all of
[1:18:04] God
[1:18:07] yep well how could he be part of God and
[1:18:09] be all of God the little spoonful of
[1:18:12] water out of the ocean is all there is
[1:18:14] in the
[1:18:16] ocean it's just in magnitude or you know
[1:18:19] amount it hadn't been displayed so can't
[1:18:22] you see that back before the world God
[1:18:25] just stepped over in another form right
[1:18:28] I got on it there Friday but I didn't
[1:18:30] finish it most of you have heard me
[1:18:32] anyway can't you just see God created
[1:18:35] the angels and things they were what he
[1:18:37] created first before he created the
[1:18:38] world that made him God that's why God
[1:18:40] is using Genesis one yep
[1:18:43] right now can't you see Satan standing
[1:18:47] up there thinking he's a great guy he's
[1:18:49] anointed Cher I'm the rightand man but
[1:18:52] I'm
[1:18:53] him anything go goes on around here I do
[1:18:57] it about that time a Halo of light steps
[1:19:00] out and goes
[1:19:03] over and he looks around he said who is
[1:19:11] that who is
[1:19:14] that cuz you see God didn't create
[1:19:17] another person no that's
[1:19:20] right Lucifer was a different person
[1:19:24] from God he was a created
[1:19:26] being brother R calls him a being so you
[1:19:29] go and do what you want to he said Satan
[1:19:31] is a
[1:19:34] being he was a created being but this
[1:19:38] one's not a created being that stepped
[1:19:40] out and began to create that's why he's
[1:19:41] the beginning of the creation of God
[1:19:44] Amen that's why I was trying to get you
[1:19:46] to see like w was bringing it out about
[1:19:48] you know that's there he was in Genesis
[1:19:50] 1 and Revelations 1 Genesis 2
[1:19:52] Revelations 2 Genesis three in
[1:19:55] Revelations 3 you remember where he was
[1:19:57] bringing it out Revelation 3 is
[1:20:00] what Genesis 3 is
[1:20:03] what I'll put enmity between thy seed
[1:20:06] and the seed of the woman right the
[1:20:08] promise of the Messiah coming and what
[1:20:10] does it say in Revelation 3:14 right the
[1:20:13] beginning of the creation of God
[1:20:15] Amen cuz that's who it was back there
[1:20:18] that's who this was here brother R said
[1:20:20] God gave birth to his own son
[1:20:24] that's another person
[1:20:27] no amen he gave birth to
[1:20:31] himself that's in a way that we could
[1:20:34] begin to comprehend and what could the
[1:20:37] scholars call it that's
[1:20:43] right now come on we've used words
[1:20:46] Elohim is a word used by mankind to try
[1:20:48] to express an eternal God right cuz it's
[1:20:52] the best word they can use mhm like what
[1:20:56] is it Zoe means God's own life but then
[1:20:59] you can get down to other words that are
[1:21:01] close to that out now if I'm wrong
[1:21:03] correct me I sry I don't work I'm just
[1:21:05] trying to show you something you got
[1:21:06] like
[1:21:07] Eon it can mean a lesser
[1:21:10] way but Zoe means God's own life well
[1:21:14] that's the only word they could come up
[1:21:15] with and they everybody established it
[1:21:18] where it be Catholic Protestants Jews
[1:21:20] Hindu Muslim whatever everybody uses
[1:21:23] some kind of a word Express their God
[1:21:29] right but you see what we're trying to
[1:21:31] see is that God condescended then we can
[1:21:33] understand it
[1:21:35] right that if he did what did he
[1:21:39] do not another
[1:21:41] God God
[1:21:43] condescending right but he took the form
[1:21:46] of a
[1:21:47] son now watch that in a
[1:21:49] minute he took the form of a
[1:21:52] son to reveal himself
[1:21:55] right that's it that's why Peter said
[1:21:57] Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[1:22:00] Living God
[1:22:02] Amen now who created like I said Friday
[1:22:05] the father didn't
[1:22:09] create it was the son that done the
[1:22:12] creating right you said no it was just
[1:22:15] the father in The see you're still
[1:22:17] trinitarian don't do that listen to
[1:22:20] where I say
[1:22:21] it the father didn't create
[1:22:25] he stepped over in another form yes but
[1:22:27] in that form he became a
[1:22:29] son
[1:22:32] that's the son is a Creator according to
[1:22:34] Hebrews 1 John 1 Colossians 1 James 3 I
[1:22:38] think it's James 3 and9 all things are
[1:22:40] created by Jesus
[1:22:44] Christ yep that's right that's why he
[1:22:47] could stand there upon the Earth and he
[1:22:49] said before Abraham was I am amen amen
[1:22:58] but
[1:23:01] listen I thought we believed in one
[1:23:05] God then why would we stumble over a
[1:23:08] prophet expressing it into human
[1:23:12] language right he didn't express it like
[1:23:15] a
[1:23:16] theologian now what would a theologian
[1:23:18] said on
[1:23:22] that that's why God didn't use none of
[1:23:24] them
[1:23:25] that's right they got too much sense
[1:23:27] right yep maybe n enough sense they got
[1:23:30] too much
[1:23:33] brain but he didn't use a
[1:23:36] theologian he didn't send a theologian
[1:23:38] in this last days the theologians will
[1:23:41] go back back here and and all you got
[1:23:43] your scof Fields you got everything come
[1:23:45] on take your Bible read it if you got a
[1:23:47] Scofield bible yeah take your Thompson
[1:23:49] chains and things it'll show you that
[1:23:52] the first form that went out of God was
[1:23:53] the son of God right sure
[1:23:56] abely called a Loos the that's what they
[1:23:59] knew but here comes a seventh grade
[1:24:01] education
[1:24:04] man yep that begin to confound the
[1:24:07] scholars by explaining to
[1:24:10] them like Dr lamzo was a he a Jew but he
[1:24:15] was also a scholar and he saw when
[1:24:19] brother brandson said he saw the signs
[1:24:21] and wonders he believed that he could
[1:24:23] see others right there praying for the
[1:24:25] sick and all he just seeting greater
[1:24:27] magnitude in this man
[1:24:30] right but when he turned around and he
[1:24:33] said Do you believe he said I believe in
[1:24:35] three attributes Father Son and Holy
[1:24:38] Ghost he said brother brandom he said
[1:24:42] now I know you're a prophet Y and you'll
[1:24:45] give your life for that
[1:24:47] belief you
[1:24:52] see but what you what people don't seem
[1:24:55] toget about me
[1:24:59] is they want to race this out and make a
[1:25:01] beautiful thing and R out make a
[1:25:04] beautiful
[1:25:08] thing right I thought we believed in
[1:25:11] restoring all
[1:25:12] things right see I didn't finish you
[1:25:15] think I 2 hours and a half I didn't get
[1:25:18] nothing started in what I was talking
[1:25:19] about that's
[1:25:23] right I thought we believ in restoring
[1:25:25] all
[1:25:27] things I thought restore
[1:25:30] meant to go back to where it originally
[1:25:35] came
[1:25:37] from y now you see I got a restored 55
[1:25:41] forward you're lying like crazy quit
[1:25:43] doing it you can't have
[1:25:46] one you can have the parts of the
[1:25:50] 55 but you ain't restoring it
[1:25:55] why because the suckers done wore out
[1:25:58] the only way you could do that is it's
[1:26:00] for some way that had took one and set
[1:26:02] it aside and never moved it never done
[1:26:04] nothing to it put it in a bubble sealed
[1:26:06] it off and then you can walk up and say
[1:26:08] there's a restored 55
[1:26:11] sh cuz you done wor to sucker out and
[1:26:13] you done put mileage on that ain't
[1:26:15] restoration right
[1:26:17] right and that's why I restore all
[1:26:20] things that's why if you and I don't
[1:26:23] have eternal life today we will not go
[1:26:26] back where we came from we we'll go back
[1:26:28] where we came from I the dust of the
[1:26:29] Earth right amen but if we have eternal
[1:26:33] life we can go back where we come from
[1:26:35] because that's what eternity mean your
[1:26:37] soul by the New Birth has already been
[1:26:39] taken back into eternity where it came
[1:26:41] from am thank you Jesus I'm not finished
[1:26:44] on the part of about God I'll get it one
[1:26:46] of these
[1:26:50] days see I believe all the things
[1:26:52] brother around says but sometimes it
[1:26:53] takes a while to wait till he reveals it
[1:26:56] amen that's right but see why can't we
[1:26:58] believe it we talk about partial
[1:27:01] realization right we say partial
[1:27:04] realization and perfect
[1:27:07] realization all right now Martin Luther
[1:27:09] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost right
[1:27:12] people say oh he didn't have it because
[1:27:14] they don't believe but brother Rand said
[1:27:15] he did said he had a new birth for his
[1:27:18] age right but compare that today won't
[1:27:21] bring you the new birth right it would
[1:27:24] then but it wouldn't won't do it now
[1:27:27] amen is that true yes
[1:27:31] right come on then can't you
[1:27:33] see that what Luther had was
[1:27:37] part but yet what he had was fullness
[1:27:40] for his age right partial realization y
[1:27:44] absolutely
[1:27:48] amen compared to perfect
[1:27:53] realization you got a piece of something
[1:27:55] that's a part of it that's right but
[1:27:58] it's just as real as all the rest of it
[1:28:00] that's right
[1:28:04] amen I thought we believed in
[1:28:07] that right see the logos that went out
[1:28:11] of God was a part of
[1:28:15] God and that part of God was a Son of
[1:28:19] God listen I wrote it like this see the
[1:28:22] life of Jesus Christ we see him as he is
[1:28:27] revealed and look at the life of Jesus
[1:28:30] Christ he's first revealed as a baby now
[1:28:32] I'm talking about Jesus the flesh all
[1:28:34] right right get out flesh flesh
[1:28:37] Jesus number one he's a
[1:28:40] baby he can't manifest all of God that's
[1:28:43] right he can't manifest God other than
[1:28:46] Christ he didn't know anything did
[1:28:49] he he had to learn didn't he the Bible
[1:28:52] said he learned right grew in Grace
[1:28:55] right amen number two at the age of
[1:28:58] about 12 somewhere the bar vit what you
[1:29:02] call that big old word somewhere in
[1:29:04] there he come up to word and he met the
[1:29:06] the scribes and Pharisees and he was the
[1:29:08] word right you agree talking to him but
[1:29:13] he couldn't die a savior amen that's
[1:29:15] right know there was part of God
[1:29:16] wouldn't die right y but yet he was all
[1:29:19] of God
[1:29:22] Amen that's right I don't understand
[1:29:25] that now you can be all God and
[1:29:27] party ask for a revelation said to River
[1:29:30] Jordan you see Jesus says he comes to a
[1:29:33] time to where he's recognized right as
[1:29:37] the Son of God that's right this is my
[1:29:39] son in whom I'm pleased to dwell in amen
[1:29:42] yep your Prophet C he becomes the
[1:29:44] fullness of the godhead bodily on the
[1:29:45] River Jordan y That's
[1:29:48] Right does he know everything no he
[1:29:51] didn't know the seals no he didn't know
[1:29:53] I mean the uh The Book of Revelation
[1:29:55] excuse me he didn't know the Book of
[1:29:56] Revelation because he come to John to
[1:29:58] tell him the things there that wasn't
[1:30:01] known as I was ustra it while ago he
[1:30:03] told the lady he said go be it according
[1:30:05] to your faith he didn't know about
[1:30:08] that all right he comes to man of
[1:30:11] transfiguration that's more of
[1:30:13] God cuz then it says this is my beloved
[1:30:16] Son in whom I pleased to dwell in here
[1:30:18] you
[1:30:20] him but see you know that ain't all of
[1:30:22] it
[1:30:26] right you said well he was the fullest
[1:30:28] he but that would all of
[1:30:32] it he had to
[1:30:35] die
[1:30:36] y to bring a resurrection
[1:30:40] y to prove who he was is that the words
[1:30:44] of the prophet in the resurrection he
[1:30:46] proved who he was right he said been
[1:30:48] many great men do this that and other
[1:30:49] but said when he raised he said that a
[1:30:52] lot of people die but said when he
[1:30:53] raised
[1:30:55] raed that then he proved who he was but
[1:30:58] you know that ain't all the
[1:31:02] Story come on he come back on the day of
[1:31:06] Pentecost in the baptism of the Holy
[1:31:08] Ghost and the bride
[1:31:10] amen right you know that ain't all the
[1:31:14] story
[1:31:15] amen I hope you're understanding how did
[1:31:18] it's part part part part
[1:31:21] right but each one of those part hearts
[1:31:24] at him into
[1:31:28] fullness right you and I got to be
[1:31:31] changed one day and taking over there
[1:31:33] now you're getting cycle completed right
[1:31:35] man all right you're getting over here
[1:31:37] where we talk about restore all
[1:31:41] things because that's got to be
[1:31:44] it now let me say this I'll just quit
[1:31:48] cuz I've tried to explain to you one God
[1:31:50] the best that I can by The Prophet's
[1:31:52] message by the Bible
[1:31:55] let me say it again then to where you
[1:31:58] won't misunderstand me where you believe
[1:32:00] it that's all right that that's
[1:32:01] God see we want to say all God was he
[1:32:06] poured into Christ
[1:32:09] right all Christ was we put the bridal
[1:32:12] here you know he poured into the church
[1:32:15] well now did you do away with God back
[1:32:20] there and to put it all in Christ did
[1:32:23] you do what with God where's the message
[1:32:25] of cheer that we get right
[1:32:28] amen can't you see there things about
[1:32:30] God has not been revealed to us in this
[1:32:32] world when we get there it's going to be
[1:32:34] a wonderful day to see God and realize
[1:32:36] who he is it's not going to be a reh
[1:32:38] hatching of all the things that we've
[1:32:40] already
[1:32:41] seen right amen it'll be an eternity
[1:32:45] partaking of a revelation of a living
[1:32:48] God that's
[1:32:50] right why I said he had attributes he
[1:32:52] didn't display but all the attributes he
[1:32:55] displayed was all he needed to display
[1:32:57] that's right well brother Dale I know
[1:32:59] it's probably about 60 times where
[1:33:02] brother said all God was he PED in
[1:33:04] Christ and all Christ he poured into the
[1:33:05] church yeah yep and it's eight times I
[1:33:08] think where he said all God was he P
[1:33:10] into Jesus and all Jesus B into the
[1:33:12] church I know that you know that's where
[1:33:15] I got the understanding
[1:33:17] from but you see the same Prophet told
[1:33:21] you they would be an eternal partaker K
[1:33:23] of a
[1:33:25] revelation
[1:33:28] amen that's
[1:33:30] right so then let's don't just race this
[1:33:33] out see let's just leave things alone
[1:33:39] amen and see that the self-existing
[1:33:42] Elohim you know what he's still in
[1:33:45] heaven that's
[1:33:47] right now old brother Dale he's inside
[1:33:50] my
[1:33:51] soul well like I said Friday night then
[1:33:53] you got a problem because the devil is
[1:33:57] talking to you where is he talking to
[1:33:59] you at is he in your
[1:34:06] soul got a problem right but you see all
[1:34:10] that God was going to be revealed now
[1:34:12] get what the prophet is saying all God
[1:34:15] was now when you say was it means you
[1:34:18] put a point to
[1:34:22] it Danny
[1:34:25] there was a day you and joy was
[1:34:29] married what does that mean I don't know
[1:34:32] what the date is so Danny can't have GE
[1:34:36] can but you know what that means that
[1:34:38] means there was a time there y so can't
[1:34:42] you see what your Prophet is trying to
[1:34:44] get us to see all God was all God was
[1:34:47] going to reveal to
[1:34:51] mankind come across a line of Eternity
[1:34:54] and begin ENT into a place that time
[1:34:56] wasn't counted or anything but he began
[1:34:58] to create and that was the Son of God
[1:35:01] the L go the very part of God now you
[1:35:04] going to have to watch me because I'm
[1:35:05] going to show you something the Lord
[1:35:07] willing naturally okay see then here's
[1:35:10] the word of God here's the Loos the
[1:35:14] theophany and that's come into Jesus
[1:35:18] Christ come into the flesh that's right
[1:35:21] oh God was right he poured into Jesus
[1:35:25] Christ
[1:35:27] right I thought the Bible said that that
[1:35:29] even the things that Jesus done that the
[1:35:32] world couldn't contain the things the
[1:35:35] books of the
[1:35:37] writings see we tried to exhaust
[1:35:41] something we use human terms okay but
[1:35:44] see now all Christ pours into a
[1:35:48] church does that do away with Jesus no
[1:35:53] does it do away with Jesus because he
[1:35:55] put on the day of Pentecost he put the
[1:35:57] baptism of the Holy Ghost into 120
[1:35:59] people 3,000 the next time and for all
[1:36:02] of these 2,000 years he's been given the
[1:36:04] new
[1:36:05] birth you don't even understand brother
[1:36:07] Rand to say in the Bible to say that
[1:36:09] they took off of Moses and put it on the
[1:36:11] others and left Moses with no less power
[1:36:15] right every person there's over 7
[1:36:18] billion people in the world
[1:36:21] today in every person in the world today
[1:36:25] could if they would receive the person
[1:36:27] of Jesus Christ and you know that would
[1:36:30] not exalt him that uh exalts him that
[1:36:34] would exalt him amen am because this has
[1:36:38] been the condescending of God to where
[1:36:41] he's actually taken and what's the word
[1:36:44] for it he he's beginning to expand
[1:36:48] himself amen that's right the church is
[1:36:51] the expanding of God
[1:36:54] that's
[1:36:55] right now see then restore all things
[1:36:59] means what somewhere in the world now I
[1:37:02] know I'm going to make a crooked drawing
[1:37:03] out of this or something but I probably
[1:37:05] done thr it
[1:37:07] away there it
[1:37:09] is now this ain't no good
[1:37:12] Circle but you see when this strikes
[1:37:17] here it's going to go here
[1:37:21] amen amen
[1:37:24] it's a complete circle
[1:37:28] right a complete circle right but it's
[1:37:31] got to be completed before it's a
[1:37:34] circle all right you said well why did
[1:37:36] you put all these over here because you
[1:37:38] see we come over here we get eternal
[1:37:40] life that restores the soul right the
[1:37:43] soul is eternal that's right if that
[1:37:46] Soul come from God right that's right I
[1:37:48] don't mind quoting it like that cuz see
[1:37:49] I'm not the two Soul
[1:37:51] people I'm quoting brother around am
[1:37:55] right I'm quoting the Bible Bible said
[1:37:57] All Souls are
[1:38:00] mine but you see we get eternal
[1:38:04] life all right now I should have put in
[1:38:07] here one more to make it
[1:38:11] correct cuz I said you try to draw and
[1:38:13] you're getting in
[1:38:15] problems I didn't spell it correct but
[1:38:17] that word is
[1:38:19] Millennium all right there you go
[1:38:23] now when is God going to be all in
[1:38:29] all let's read that scripture what is it
[1:38:32] in Corinthians somebody find it for me
[1:38:34] if I 15 Corinthians 7 what is it 15 yeah
[1:38:40] 1 Corinthians 15
[1:38:46] yeah 1 Corinthians
[1:38:49] 15 20 2 right well you read it back up
[1:38:53] above there cuz we're running out of
[1:38:54] time all right let's go down to it let
[1:38:57] let's get it right let's start in verse
[1:38:58] at least verse 23 but every man in his
[1:39:01] own order Christ the first fruits
[1:39:02] afterward they that are Christ at his
[1:39:05] coming then cometh the end when he shall
[1:39:08] have delivered up the kingdom to God now
[1:39:11] who's that talking about right Jesus
[1:39:15] Christ the son right that right
[1:39:20] amen delivered up the kingdom to God
[1:39:24] even the father when he shall have put
[1:39:26] down all Rule and all authority and
[1:39:28] power cuz all power is given into Jesus
[1:39:30] Christ and it's he's the one that's
[1:39:32] going to put down all this that's why
[1:39:34] Jesus Christ has to come riding back on
[1:39:36] the White Horse
[1:39:40] right right right with you and I into
[1:39:44] the Millennium Revelation 19
[1:39:46] okay all right now watch he must reain
[1:39:49] till he hath put all enemies under his
[1:39:51] feet The Last Enemy that shall be
[1:39:53] destroyed is death all right now watch
[1:39:57] now death is not destroyed at the
[1:39:59] Millennium or before the Millennium
[1:40:01] that's right only death for certain
[1:40:04] people right amen which is the bride of
[1:40:06] Christ
[1:40:07] right and then you got your Jews coming
[1:40:09] up and things like that into the
[1:40:11] Millennium right okay but see they still
[1:40:13] death because you got the the white own
[1:40:16] judgment and then you got the Lake of
[1:40:18] Fire which is the the death and hell is
[1:40:20] cast into the Lake of Fire is to be
[1:40:21] destroyed okay so you got it Last Enemy
[1:40:24] that shall be destroyed his death for he
[1:40:26] ha put all things under his feet he God
[1:40:30] has put all things under he Jesus's feet
[1:40:34] Christ s right but when he saith
[1:40:38] almighty God sayith all things are put
[1:40:41] under Jesus Christ it is Manifest that
[1:40:45] he God is the one that's
[1:40:47] accepted see I've never caught that
[1:40:50] scripture I preached on it before you
[1:40:52] know that
[1:40:54] which did put all things under him who
[1:40:57] put all things under Jesus
[1:40:59] Christ right almighty
[1:41:04] god well now you're
[1:41:07] trinitarian okay now watch when all
[1:41:10] things shall be subdued unto him now we
[1:41:14] just read over here in verse 24 that he
[1:41:16] would deliver up the kingdom to God even
[1:41:19] the
[1:41:20] father okay and when he shall have
[1:41:23] subdued all he shall and when all things
[1:41:26] shall be subdued unto him then shall the
[1:41:28] son also himself be subject unto him
[1:41:31] that put all things under him that God
[1:41:34] may be all in all
[1:41:39] right
[1:41:42] now for just a
[1:41:44] minute and you'll see what I've been
[1:41:46] driving that for 40
[1:41:48] years I couldn't get it Friday night I
[1:41:51] couldn't finish all of it up
[1:41:55] see there's a
[1:41:57] time now you're going to have to listen
[1:42:00] and you're going to trick me with words
[1:42:01] and trap me so go
[1:42:04] ahead but you better
[1:42:06] listen if we don't believe in Eternal
[1:42:11] sunship if the prophet didn't believe in
[1:42:14] Eternal
[1:42:15] sunship there is some way that
[1:42:18] Prophet must bring us to the
[1:42:21] understanding by the Bible
[1:42:23] that the
[1:42:25] sunship not terminate like you think
[1:42:29] right it doesn't say
[1:42:32] that it says he will
[1:42:38] surrender now this is something I've
[1:42:41] never said to you
[1:42:42] publicly I've said it in roundabout ways
[1:42:45] for years cuz I've been
[1:42:47] waiting there's got to be a time when
[1:42:49] the
[1:42:51] sunship when be in existence to be used
[1:42:55] as a redeemer cuz sunship is Redeemer
[1:42:58] savior healer Etc is in
[1:43:01] sunship there'll be a Time come when you
[1:43:04] will not need to be saved you will not
[1:43:06] need to be healed you will not be need
[1:43:08] to be redeemed you will be redeemed amen
[1:43:12] all
[1:43:13] right so now the sunship is not going to
[1:43:16] go out of the way now so you go ahead
[1:43:19] it's not going out of the way cuz I know
[1:43:22] what people's minds will do what's
[1:43:23] tricking you words and in nowh in the
[1:43:26] world have I ever believed that it'll go
[1:43:28] out of the way I believe that when we
[1:43:30] step over there in
[1:43:33] eternity and we're going to get right
[1:43:35] here and see where it's
[1:43:38] coming we going to see Jesus Christ Y
[1:43:41] and we going to know who he
[1:43:47] is we're going to see him in
[1:43:51] know may I quote brother
[1:43:55] in the
[1:43:58] Millennium I don't have this I'll be
[1:44:00] glad to get it for you in the
[1:44:03] Millennium Jesus will lead us up on the
[1:44:11] mountain and bow
[1:44:13] down before the
[1:44:16] father and said Papa God if you had to
[1:44:19] come
[1:44:23] that's what your Prophet
[1:44:27] said so watch
[1:44:30] it in the
[1:44:32] Millennium only the bride will know him
[1:44:37] in the full Plan of
[1:44:39] Redemption because it's already taken
[1:44:42] place while we're here before the
[1:44:44] Millennium comes
[1:44:46] right she will see him as her husband
[1:44:50] right she will be brother dick the wife
[1:44:53] that rides back
[1:44:55] in the Book of Revelations that's right
[1:44:59] and she will see him as he is because
[1:45:03] she will be like him am I quoting
[1:45:06] scripture all right so
[1:45:09] now let's see what the prophet
[1:45:16] said thirsting for Life 1957 630 and Son
[1:45:21] means had a
[1:45:25] beginning
[1:45:27] amen so how could
[1:45:30] it how could it be an eternal
[1:45:33] godship excuse me how could it it it
[1:45:37] could be Eternal an eternal
[1:45:41] godship but never an eternal
[1:45:46] sunship a son is one that's begotten of
[1:45:50] so it had a be beginning
[1:45:55] the logos the word the Son of God the
[1:45:57] theophany at a
[1:46:05] beginning brother brandom how are you
[1:46:07] going to place all in
[1:46:08] all page 67 Christ of Myst of God reveal
[1:46:11] preach 1963 728 and at that day the
[1:46:16] kingdom be given over to the father is
[1:46:18] that what we read
[1:46:20] right you want to read it again is that
[1:46:22] what we we read over here in the
[1:46:23] scripture in in
[1:46:26] Corinthians did he give it up to the
[1:46:28] father let's read it where you hold on
[1:46:30] then cometh the end and he shall deliver
[1:46:32] up the kingdom to God even the Father
[1:46:34] which shall have put all power and Rule
[1:46:36] down right so listen to your Prophet at
[1:46:39] that day the kingdom be given over to
[1:46:41] the father he might be all in all while
[1:46:44] he's yet speaking I'll hear days of
[1:46:47] Christ you say well now how you going to
[1:46:48] place it David sitting on the throne the
[1:46:51] king over the whole human
[1:46:53] race now that's got to be the Millennium
[1:46:57] that David sits on the
[1:46:59] throne okay
[1:47:02] y now so the bride will see
[1:47:08] him in the
[1:47:10] Millennium and he'll lead us up the
[1:47:16] mountain and he'll bow down to worship
[1:47:18] too
[1:47:23] and he say papa if you had to
[1:47:33] come he said what are you talking about
[1:47:36] Jesus in the Millennium leading us up
[1:47:37] and praying exactly
[1:47:39] right cuz there's the key where it will
[1:47:42] come to a time and I'll get to it in
[1:47:45] just a second and I get page I gave it
[1:47:47] to you Friday night but I wonder how
[1:47:48] many paid attention right future home
[1:47:51] 1964 802 city with a mountain in the top
[1:47:56] y Revelation
[1:47:58] 2123 Y and they need no light for the
[1:48:01] Lamb of the Lord God is the light
[1:48:04] thereof see the Lord God is the pillar
[1:48:07] of fire that followed the children of
[1:48:09] Israel through the Wilderness and he has
[1:48:11] ascended upon the throne in that perfect
[1:48:14] Kingdom when time the kingdom that Jesus
[1:48:17] is to surrender to the father that God
[1:48:20] might be all in all
[1:48:23] now watching Jesus sits upon his throne
[1:48:26] here is our Joseph then the king is the
[1:48:30] light that will be on the top of the
[1:48:32] Mount Zion and His Holy Light will flood
[1:48:35] the entire
[1:48:37] city that's
[1:48:40] right so in the future
[1:48:45] home he'll deliver the
[1:48:49] kingdom he won't go out of existence or
[1:48:53] the father say well don't need you no
[1:48:55] more you
[1:48:59] gone
[1:49:01] no cuz that's what your mind tells you
[1:49:04] right that's right no way Amen Let
[1:49:08] eternity will make a
[1:49:09] circle and this eternal Elohim will be
[1:49:13] sitting there but who will it
[1:49:16] be amen according to your prophet and I
[1:49:19] just read to you Jesus will sit on the
[1:49:22] throne amen that's it why then because
[1:49:25] your mind will see that God is all in
[1:49:29] all the sunship will not be done away
[1:49:33] with because that Jesus to be sitting on
[1:49:36] the throne will have nail prints in his
[1:49:39] hands
[1:49:42] amen but then we'll see him as Jesus
[1:49:44] said if you seen me you seen the father
[1:49:46] absolutely
[1:49:50] amen that's one true and living God
[1:49:54] amen that's not
[1:49:56] Oneness and that's not Trinity
[1:50:01] amen you said well one this just one
[1:50:03] like your finger and ain't no more
[1:50:06] manifestations you you better consider
[1:50:08] what's draw out here because here's
[1:50:09] manifestation here's manifestation
[1:50:12] here's the bride of Christ all
[1:50:13] manifestation and one day the world will
[1:50:15] even be made Eternal right amen right
[1:50:23] that God may be all and
[1:50:30] all it's not the Sun going out of
[1:50:34] existence it's all of those attributes
[1:50:37] coming
[1:50:38] back all of those attributes he had over
[1:50:41] here must return to the
[1:50:44] right and his attributes with Father Son
[1:50:47] and Holy
[1:50:51] Ghost but the key is we'll see him as he
[1:50:54] is because we shall be like
[1:50:57] him now if you do away with sunship
[1:50:59] you're going to do away with you that's
[1:51:03] right
[1:51:04] right I thought we were believed we were
[1:51:07] the sons and daughters of God so I
[1:51:10] wouldn't do away with sunship if I was
[1:51:12] you right I would keep it and let it all
[1:51:17] be made manifest right back into the
[1:51:19] great Eternal God but then when you do
[1:51:21] and you see him standing there he won't
[1:51:23] be self-existing
[1:51:27] that's the one thing he will never be I
[1:51:30] gave you a quote the other night Friday
[1:51:32] night about
[1:51:34] it he will never be alone
[1:51:37] again right he'll never be self-existing
[1:51:41] he will be the one who exists with his
[1:51:44] attributes his
[1:51:45] children his
[1:51:48] offspring and you know there'll be
[1:51:49] people in heaven that or whatever you
[1:51:51] want to call it future home here on
[1:51:53] Earth there'll be people there that are
[1:51:55] given eternal life but they will be no
[1:51:58] part of what I'm talking about that's
[1:51:59] right amen they will only be granted
[1:52:02] eternal life right
[1:52:04] y Adam never went through a process to
[1:52:07] become
[1:52:09] Eternal Adam was by
[1:52:14] impartation other people will be by
[1:52:16] impartation
[1:52:18] right and they'll have eternal life but
[1:52:21] they won't be the Bri
[1:52:26] right wonderful day let stand come
[1:52:32] on you forgive me if you think I'm wrong
[1:52:34] throwing that down I've thought about
[1:52:36] that a long time cuz that's what you
[1:52:38] think about these
[1:52:41] quotes I'm up here quoting brother
[1:52:43] brandham to the
[1:52:45] letter and you're sitting there
[1:52:47] wondering whether or not that's what he
[1:52:49] Sav
[1:52:53] is at your
[1:52:59] feet you're the ones trampling on this
[1:53:06] message and God forgive us
[1:53:10] all forgive us all for being what we are
[1:53:13] as human
[1:53:14] beings but you know we can't change that
[1:53:17] now but one day it'll all be over
[1:53:20] with what we got
[1:53:28] 188 188 anybody have a need say I
[1:53:31] believe that same God Lives amen and I
[1:53:35] believe as long as we need a Healer he's
[1:53:37] here as long as there Redemption needed
[1:53:40] he's here he's here for whatever you
[1:53:43] have need of but he's almighty
[1:53:46] God now that almighty God is made
[1:53:50] manifest in his bride right

[1:55:02] it we're standing with the perfect
[1:55:04] realization the brother said the perfect
[1:55:08] interpretation my Divine

[1:55:31] Bible
[1:55:33] sure this is the one he took and read
[1:55:36] and said come and let's
