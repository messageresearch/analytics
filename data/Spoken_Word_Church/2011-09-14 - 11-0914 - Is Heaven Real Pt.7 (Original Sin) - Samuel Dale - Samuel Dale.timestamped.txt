[3:07] father we thank you for this day in the
[3:08] hour that we're living we thank you for
[3:10] grace
[3:11] love and joy and peace in our hearts
[3:14] thank you for all things and we know
[3:16] that you said you give them to us freely
[3:19] so that all that means is we have to do
[3:21] is just receive it
[3:23] we thank you
[3:24] just have your way now bless us as we
[3:26] try to speak about you and
[3:28] lord as we
[3:30] try to read your word and talk about the
[3:32] things the prophet has said unto us
[3:35] we pray that you would just come on the
[3:37] scene now and be with each and every one
[3:39] forgive our sins and lead us by thy
[3:41] grace
[3:42] we know that there's many sick among us
[3:44] tonight
[3:45] and you said you said it you promised it
[3:48] he said you sent your word and healed us
[3:50] and delivered us from destruction so
[3:53] lord we commit it all to you have your
[3:55] way now and guide us in jesus name
[3:59] hebrews for familiar scripture with all
[4:02] but hebrews
[4:04] 10 will begin reverse about 19.
[4:10] having therefore brethren boldness to
[4:13] enter into the holy holiest by the blood
[4:16] of jesus
[4:17] by a new and living way which he had
[4:19] consecrated for us through the veil that
[4:21] is to say his flesh
[4:24] and having a high priest over the house
[4:26] of god
[4:27] let us draw near with a true heart and
[4:29] full assurance
[4:31] of faith having our hearts sprinkled
[4:33] from evil conscience from an evil
[4:36] conscience
[4:37] and our bodies washed with pure water
[4:40] let us hold fast the profession of our
[4:42] faith without wavering
[4:44] for he that is faithful
[4:46] had for he is faithful that promised
[4:49] let us consider
[4:51] one another to provoke unto love
[4:54] into good works that means to encourage
[4:56] provoke means to encourage all right
[4:59] not forsaking the assembling of
[5:01] ourselves together as a matter of some
[5:03] is you know what the prophet said that
[5:05] is a man of unbelievers but exhorting
[5:08] one another
[5:09] and so much more that
[5:11] more as you see the day approaching for
[5:13] if we sin willfully after that we have
[5:16] received the knowledge of the truth
[5:18] there remaineth no more sacrifice for
[5:22] sins you may be seated
[5:25] the lord had his blessings with reading
[5:27] of the word
[5:28] now i'm still crooked as i'll get out
[5:30] and
[5:32] as of now
[5:33] i go tuesday to find out this they won't
[5:36] operate now they first told me no and
[5:38] now they said yes so we're going to
[5:40] worry about it
[5:41] that's right you're going to be
[5:42] concerned either way that's right so we
[5:44] just got
[5:45] the lord to to do it and if they'll tell
[5:48] me that it'll help me then i'll be all
[5:51] right if they tell me it ain't then we
[5:52] ain't gonna worry about it so you know
[5:55] we just leave it into the hands of the
[5:56] lord but i'm still creepy and i can't
[5:59] shake that part but i can still croak it
[6:02] out
[6:02] i'll get it out one way or the other
[6:06] amen all right now
[6:08] when we left we preached on
[6:11] the wednesday night
[6:13] there and trying to bring out
[6:16] um how the
[6:18] sin originated in heaven that's right it
[6:21] didn't originate on earth
[6:23] the first battle that was ever fought
[6:25] was fought in heaven
[6:27] now
[6:29] i know that's hard to comprehend
[6:33] and as i said
[6:34] we we don't know any of the theologians
[6:37] etc and all that would even talk about
[6:39] these things
[6:41] but a prophet told us what took place in
[6:44] heaven
[6:45] and uh you know so then
[6:48] maybe we need to consider this a little
[6:51] more i spoke on this up with brother
[6:53] richards on the
[6:55] the uh evening service
[6:58] and kind of took it in
[7:00] and just a
[7:01] you know not reading a lot of quotes but
[7:03] just doing and and
[7:05] trying to cover a large scale
[7:08] of what we've been talking about and
[7:11] they seem to enjoy it so i i enjoyed
[7:13] speaking it so i guess it made to enjoy
[7:16] it anyway
[7:17] but
[7:18] you know
[7:19] now i tried to get you to see that
[7:22] how could sin happen in the presence
[7:26] of a perfect eternity right if you
[7:29] wanted to call it
[7:30] you know right heaven
[7:34] all right then we found out that
[7:38] satan was not satan in the beginning
[7:40] right right he was the anointed cherub
[7:43] that's right amen he was created perfect
[7:46] he was not created eternal
[7:48] but perfect
[7:50] and his ways was perfect
[7:52] but he became exalted in himself
[7:56] and it was there in heaven that just
[7:58] took place because the angels were
[8:00] created and
[8:02] and it could have been millions and
[8:03] millions and millions of what we call
[8:05] life of life you know our
[8:07] our time
[8:09] uh before even the world was created in
[8:11] all of the things and and all like that
[8:14] and it probably took satan a long time i
[8:16] call him satan because but back there it
[8:18] was really lucifer right so he wasn't
[8:20] satan until he was cast out
[8:22] all right so then you know he was the
[8:25] anointed cherub
[8:27] the scripture says that he stood beside
[8:29] the lord
[8:31] all right
[8:32] but i wanted you to get one point and
[8:34] that was what i emphasized to them up
[8:36] there whatever the first lie was in
[8:40] heaven
[8:41] whatever the first sin was
[8:45] see then it would have to happen in the
[8:47] garden of eden
[8:49] right
[8:50] with eve and
[8:52] adam and you know
[8:55] satan
[8:57] and that that would be also the same lie
[9:01] the same sin
[9:04] that would happen in the end time and i
[9:07] told you here i was talking about alpha
[9:09] and omega so whatever it was in the
[9:11] beginning would have to come back around
[9:14] to be there and we're we are the only
[9:17] people
[9:18] that this could take place on
[9:20] because the bible says they must become
[9:22] a fallen away right now
[9:24] all right now you must be somewhere to
[9:26] fall away
[9:28] now you cannot have the holy ghost and
[9:30] fall away from the holy ghost and be
[9:32] lost
[9:33] now don't get that thought into your
[9:35] mind and when we get into it in a little
[9:37] bit there were that we we covered it or
[9:40] read in verse 26 that if we send
[9:42] willfully after
[9:44] receiving the knowledge of the truth
[9:46] that's right the prophet of god said
[9:47] that's not born again christians
[9:51] he said that it was
[9:53] borderline believers
[9:55] people who had received the knowledge of
[9:58] the truth
[9:59] all right now around the world today
[10:03] we have the ability to be able to
[10:05] understand
[10:07] uh the bible
[10:10] and to understand the
[10:12] words coming straight from the mouth of
[10:15] the prophet of god
[10:17] to come in our day and bring us the
[10:19] truth so we're the only people that can
[10:22] really
[10:24] bring sin
[10:26] into an attribute form
[10:29] and display it
[10:31] you know
[10:32] in the way that it would really bring it
[10:34] out because the bible says that god
[10:37] winked at the ignorance
[10:39] all right right now luther was as we've
[10:41] always said not disgrace degrading him
[10:44] but he sat in a pub and drank beer and
[10:47] and talked about the bible and smoked a
[10:50] pie
[10:51] well
[10:51] god winked at that
[10:53] well it's not supposed to be that way
[10:55] now right right
[10:57] because we're supposed to be back to the
[11:00] end of it all coming forth all right
[11:03] but see now keep in mind what i'm saying
[11:06] whatever was the original sin
[11:08] would have to be the same sin in the
[11:10] garden
[11:12] and then it would have to be the same
[11:13] sin at the end time
[11:15] all right and we covered and they really
[11:17] enjoyed the point i was bringing out
[11:19] about you know that
[11:20] if we say smoking drank and gambling and
[11:22] running around with women is sin
[11:24] the prophet said that wouldn't sin he
[11:26] said that's attributes of unbelief
[11:28] because those angels had no ability to
[11:31] do those things
[11:33] they didn't have an ability to smoke
[11:35] drank chill running around so we need to
[11:37] get rid of all of that
[11:39] right from even our thinking and in
[11:42] consideration and get down to looking at
[11:45] what is sin
[11:46] right all right see we say well we know
[11:49] what it is his unbelief
[11:51] but what was the thing
[11:54] that we we we look at the garden of eden
[11:58] and we see that there was a uh an act
[12:01] that took place
[12:03] between eve and the beast all right but
[12:05] that act was an attribute
[12:08] right
[12:09] all right a display
[12:12] of unbelief
[12:14] because if she had not disbelieved in
[12:16] her inner being
[12:18] her spirit part of her
[12:21] she would have not done that right and
[12:23] that was the first things he done she
[12:24] disbelieved
[12:26] all right so the sin has to deal with
[12:28] the inward parts of us
[12:31] and not with the display of the outward
[12:34] right so we look over here in the end
[12:36] time and see then that we are the only
[12:39] people lula georgia we'll say like that
[12:41] everybody else that's her business
[12:43] lula georgia has the ability to fall
[12:46] away
[12:47] from the knowledge of the truth right
[12:49] right sure because we've heard the
[12:52] knowledge of them that's right
[12:55] now if we fall away from it then there
[12:58] is no sacrifice
[13:00] all right
[13:02] because that would be the the wrong
[13:04] thing
[13:05] but now
[13:06] let's go back what we were talking about
[13:12] and we looked at
[13:15] lucifer
[13:17] i gave you the quotes there the other
[13:18] night on it so you don't need to have
[13:20] them
[13:21] that
[13:22] he uh
[13:24] he was god's right-hand man
[13:27] that's right
[13:29] he was the anointed cherub that stood
[13:31] beside the lord
[13:33] well why would he get all a problem you
[13:36] know
[13:38] was it some way that god made him
[13:41] no you would make god the author
[13:44] of sin so don't do
[13:46] that we think about eve in the garden
[13:49] that she was made lustfully you know on
[13:52] those styles to make all of this work
[13:54] and
[13:55] why
[13:58] she was already an unbeliever before
[14:00] she'd done anything with the beast
[14:03] the sin had originated before she done
[14:06] anything right so why are you even
[14:08] considerate of of anything that would be
[14:11] that god would make her in a way oh we
[14:13] got the quotes
[14:15] yeah read you quote but just remember
[14:17] god couldn't make her wrong right
[14:22] and then judge her for being wrong
[14:24] that's right you could not make lucifer
[14:26] wrong and judge you for being wrong
[14:28] right
[14:29] he made him perfect
[14:32] he made eve perfect
[14:34] all right
[14:35] but the choice they made is where the
[14:37] wrong
[14:38] became involved
[14:40] well what was the choice that we were
[14:42] talking about of
[14:44] lucifer
[14:49] he just couldn't comprehend
[14:53] now did he disbelieve god
[14:55] in a basis did he not believe in a god
[14:59] another prophet of god said he wasn't
[15:00] that away right she believed god i ran
[15:03] off a couple of quotes and they can give
[15:04] them to you but run around and said the
[15:06] greatest lie that's ever been told is 99
[15:10] true
[15:14] all right what satan or lucifer whatever
[15:16] who you want to call him told eve in the
[15:19] garden
[15:20] was 99
[15:22] truth that's right amen
[15:27] the only problem was
[15:29] was the interpretation
[15:32] of that truth or way
[15:34] all right
[15:35] so then
[15:38] lucifer was jealous with reggie of
[15:41] michael right
[15:42] being brought around he called him his
[15:44] boss
[15:45] you know he was jealous
[15:48] why
[15:51] mom went to be jealous
[15:53] of michael
[15:56] now i hope you caught this point i just
[15:58] made some remarks about what i did
[16:00] preach
[16:02] i hope you caught the point that
[16:04] if it hadn't been for michael
[16:08] lucifer would have been annihilated when
[16:10] he done what he done
[16:12] that's right
[16:14] i hope you caught that point
[16:18] michael is what kept god from destroying
[16:22] lucifer right
[16:24] but yet that was who lucifer wanted to
[16:27] destroy
[16:29] right
[16:32] come on that was who he wanted to
[16:33] destroy he wanted to destroy michael
[16:36] or christ his brother around him david
[16:39] when joe's got a couple of americans
[16:41] shoot him up let you written while i'm
[16:42] talking but you know
[16:44] brother brown said on beginning the end
[16:46] of the gentile dispensation
[16:48] that my should stand and i said michael
[16:50] was christ of course right all right he
[16:53] was christ
[16:56] okay
[16:57] then he goes down to christ the mystery
[16:58] of god revealed and talks about how on
[17:01] paragraph 543
[17:04] that
[17:06] satan was what he wanted was a greater
[17:08] splendor and seemingly more cultured a
[17:11] greater kingdom than michael
[17:14] christ
[17:15] had
[17:16] see michael was christ
[17:19] that's why it says over in the book of
[17:20] daniel that michael your prince
[17:26] a prince is a
[17:28] son
[17:29] getting ready to be king right
[17:31] you come up to the prince then you
[17:33] become king right all right so then that
[17:35] would show who it was that it was christ
[17:38] all right
[17:39] but why would
[17:41] why would you want to destroy
[17:44] now i know satan didn't think that
[17:47] lucifer you know he didn't realize
[17:50] but why would you want to destroy
[17:54] your savior
[17:58] but
[18:00] well now brother dale i wouldn't want to
[18:01] do that for nothing in the world
[18:03] well evidently that's what lucifer
[18:05] wanted
[18:09] he fought with it right i don't believe
[18:12] it was a physical battle you know right
[18:15] but all he was doing was trying to set a
[18:17] stage to be able to
[18:19] house michael
[18:22] out of the way right
[18:24] because he couldn't comprehend michael
[18:27] you can see all the angels he could see
[18:29] all the things right he knew how he came
[18:33] but yet he just couldn't comprehend
[18:35] michael
[18:39] he couldn't understand christ right but
[18:42] what about now i hope that this digs
[18:44] down deep inside of you
[18:47] that lucifer was wanting to destroy
[18:50] michael
[18:51] and michael was the only hopes he had
[18:54] right
[18:55] i had michael turned around and said
[18:57] lucifer you are an annihilated
[19:02] he would have took place man all right
[19:05] sir
[19:07] but see michael knew christ knew
[19:11] that there had to be something caused to
[19:13] fall to take place and the things it
[19:15] would have to be
[19:18] and in doing that then
[19:21] he knew that he had to preserve
[19:25] listen
[19:27] he could throw him into outer darkness
[19:28] down to the earth and give a dominion
[19:31] here and things but he had to
[19:34] protect him right
[19:38] you say well well well that's some kind
[19:41] of a of a devil
[19:43] well
[19:45] i asked the brothers and sisters up to
[19:47] our question simple one
[19:50] why is it that seemingly the last two or
[19:53] three major doctrines
[19:55] that have developed in this message
[19:57] people
[19:58] like the two lords
[20:01] in the uh what was because of river
[20:04] jordan
[20:05] those people that believe that jesus
[20:06] wasn't god
[20:08] isn't it odd that these doctrines and i
[20:11] told you probably 30 years ago or close
[20:13] to 40
[20:14] that if you think the the two souls and
[20:16] all that would be a deceiving doctrine
[20:19] now how many times did most of you heard
[20:21] me say this at least 10 times have you
[20:24] i said
[20:25] you wait
[20:26] it'll be closer than that
[20:30] see now they're destroying
[20:32] christ or jesus
[20:35] or jesus christ
[20:38] amen right see if you say that that
[20:40] jesus is another identity
[20:43] or another person
[20:46] you're just the same thing there was at
[20:47] nicea council
[20:49] in 325 a.d
[20:51] you're the same thing as the catholic
[20:53] doctrine right
[20:54] the catholic doctrine did he that he is
[20:57] the what
[20:58] the third person of the trinity
[21:01] you know
[21:02] all right
[21:03] see what the doctrines
[21:05] how they destroyed christ
[21:08] you ever notice brother brown says
[21:10] preached a message one time called
[21:12] raising jesus from history
[21:17] go listen to that message
[21:19] see we dethroned him totally by our
[21:22] denominational doctrines of the trinity
[21:24] we actually took him totally off the
[21:26] throne
[21:28] and exalted satan
[21:31] to the position he wanted
[21:34] by believing a trinity right well really
[21:36] you know
[21:39] it's not too bad
[21:41] how much does it take
[21:43] that's right
[21:45] i've got a quote in here where brother
[21:47] brown says well whether it's initial
[21:49] evidences or not whatever you know
[21:54] he said that's what they done in rome
[21:59] he said well you know why are you all so
[22:01] mean and arrogant and hateful about
[22:03] being so strong about something or a
[22:06] doctrinal thing
[22:08] when those are good people
[22:11] yeah and that's what they came to moses
[22:13] the day after the ground swallowed up a
[22:16] couple two or three hundred thousand of
[22:17] them or so many
[22:19] and you know what they said the next day
[22:22] they come to moses and said you
[22:23] destroyed the people of god yeah they
[22:26] couldn't even remember the day before
[22:27] how many of them went in the ground
[22:30] right
[22:32] but you see
[22:35] satan
[22:37] wanted to get to that place that he
[22:39] thought was rightfully his
[22:45] was the right-hand man
[22:49] and had he not got exalted look what a
[22:51] position he would have had right
[22:54] wouldn't it be something to be god's
[22:56] right-hand man amen
[23:00] but by being that close to god you know
[23:02] that he knew
[23:04] a lot of the
[23:05] secret
[23:07] that the other angels didn't know
[23:09] right
[23:12] now didn't he tell eve one of them
[23:14] right
[23:16] you'll be his god
[23:18] that's right amen knowing good and evil
[23:23] lauren said he had a knowledge
[23:26] of the principles of life
[23:29] that's how he knew the monkey and eve
[23:31] couldn't work
[23:32] you know what i'm saying
[23:34] so he had to bring in the beast
[23:37] to get the closer into the human race
[23:40] to be able to mix the seed
[23:42] that's right satan knew these things
[23:51] what about it church
[23:55] you mean you would want to destroy your
[23:57] savior
[24:00] now anybody got any sense wouldn't
[24:03] that goes to show you that it's spirits
[24:05] right
[24:07] demons
[24:08] and not people
[24:10] anybody with common sense sit down for
[24:12] one minute and think about it they'd say
[24:14] no i don't want to destroy my savior and
[24:16] i'll preach you 49 sermons well he died
[24:19] for me
[24:21] but if you make him a second person
[24:23] right
[24:24] what have you done
[24:25] that's right
[24:27] if you make him a different identity
[24:29] these are words people use
[24:33] that i can call the name to fit the
[24:34] doctrine and they say he's another
[24:37] identity
[24:39] and that he's another person
[24:45] you see you say well why would you be so
[24:48] uh strong
[24:50] to to try to warn people
[24:54] because what they're saying is so close
[24:56] to the truth
[24:58] sure all right amen
[25:03] now get the point
[25:08] satan disbelieved god
[25:12] right right
[25:14] because that was his unbelief
[25:18] god had a way of doing things
[25:22] and satan
[25:24] wanted his way
[25:26] right
[25:28] to do that right
[25:30] you see how easy elias
[25:35] i've told you the doctrine i'm trying to
[25:36] get away from calling the names to spit
[25:38] them but
[25:39] there is a doctrine among one of the big
[25:41] organized religions
[25:42] that says that satan
[25:45] wanted to save everybody
[25:48] but that jesus only wanted to save so
[25:50] many of us
[25:52] and that god rejected satan's
[25:55] belief now if you want to go i'll give
[25:57] you the
[25:58] people to go to and you go talk to him
[26:00] brother dick likes to do that he likes
[26:01] to find somebody and go out there say
[26:04] okay now what do you believe well that's
[26:06] good
[26:08] because that way you find out firsthand
[26:10] right
[26:12] but see
[26:13] what about a a devil wanting to save
[26:15] everybody
[26:17] and god only won't say so many
[26:21] it looks like the devil is a greater god
[26:23] than than our god
[26:27] but it shows his deceivingness
[26:34] he shows what he's trying to do
[26:40] he didn't say there wasn't any god
[26:44] he just couldn't understand where
[26:45] michael came from and his position in
[26:48] the situation because that was
[26:50] withholding from him
[26:52] all right
[26:54] but he set out then in his own jealous
[26:57] ways
[26:58] to preach the gospel
[27:01] yep
[27:03] that's right he preached to the angels
[27:07] and the angels believed his doctrine
[27:09] amen
[27:11] what was his doctrine i don't understand
[27:13] this guy michael
[27:16] i don't understand
[27:18] this i don't understand who he is and
[27:21] what he is
[27:23] i just know god told me i'm his right
[27:26] hand man
[27:28] if anything takes place supposed to be
[27:30] through me
[27:31] now
[27:36] may i drop this in
[27:38] what about the preachers of this message
[27:43] that's right
[27:45] what about the preachers of this message
[27:47] that say if you don't come to our church
[27:56] any of you ever been told if you go
[27:58] somewhere else
[28:00] now the roundabouts fly away now not
[28:03] outlandish remarks from the mouth
[28:09] we're going down to it in a minute what
[28:11] about those who try to destroy the
[28:13] faithful ministry right amen
[28:18] when the final four ministries on the
[28:20] hope the bride has amen that's right
[28:22] you agree
[28:24] if not you're just going to listen to me
[28:26] you know saving trouble driving right
[28:28] now
[28:30] well see at least you must have some
[28:31] dependence
[28:33] upon the fifo ministry
[28:35] to you know because we know what the
[28:36] bible says about them that they're given
[28:38] for the you know
[28:40] to watch for our souls
[28:42] well if they're given to watch for our
[28:44] souls
[28:45] we we you know we ought to depend on
[28:47] that
[28:49] brother dale do you depend on fifo
[28:50] ministry yes sir amen that's right there
[28:52] ain't no one fold in this look on his
[28:54] mind and never has been right
[28:57] i believe in the final full ministry
[28:58] amen amen
[29:00] i bring them in
[29:01] to you to preach to you because i know i
[29:04] can't preach at all
[29:06] never have thought that never had no
[29:08] thoughts about it
[29:10] but now watch what would be the original
[29:12] sin
[29:14] would be
[29:15] that
[29:16] lucifer would become in his own way
[29:20] of
[29:21] uh
[29:22] jealousies and
[29:24] and things
[29:25] to worry that he would want to to get
[29:28] rid of michael
[29:32] what about trying to destroy the effects
[29:36] of the faithful ministry that's right
[29:40] there's nobody hey i write it down
[29:44] i write down so i just see what you say
[29:47] you say but brother dale they don't want
[29:49] to destroy you
[29:53] come on
[29:54] i'm human
[29:56] i've always told you i don't believe my
[29:58] worst enemy wants to get rid of me
[30:01] maybe they'd like to shut me up a little
[30:02] bit once in a while but they don't want
[30:04] to destroy me i've never believed that
[30:06] about anybody
[30:11] i believe there's a lot of people
[30:12] respect me
[30:15] right
[30:16] all that all right
[30:18] but what about destroying the effect
[30:22] of the word that the person preaches
[30:26] right amen wouldn't that be the
[30:28] same thing that lucifer was doing in the
[30:30] beginning
[30:34] see to destroy a man's influences
[30:36] destroy the man
[30:41] but see
[30:44] you see how simple it was in heaven
[30:48] that satan told the lie the eli brought
[30:51] around says he said it was the same lie
[30:53] that he told eve he should have said it
[30:55] he said it says they lie there he said i
[30:57] looked it up said it should be
[30:58] translated eli
[31:03] and what about a lie
[31:06] that would take an angel
[31:10] that would be in a holy pious
[31:13] condition
[31:16] no sin no drinking gambling smoking no
[31:19] no problems
[31:24] and bring them to
[31:25] believing it right
[31:31] we read with the other day where that
[31:32] brother brown said
[31:34] satan wanted to make his heart more
[31:36] beautiful
[31:38] he said we see it in the garden
[31:40] he said there's abel with a little lamb
[31:43] to
[31:43] just kill it you know bloody mess
[31:47] but he said there was
[31:49] cain
[31:50] a beautiful altar
[31:57] so that evidently lucifer was thinking
[32:02] you know i'm greater than michael
[32:08] i'm more beautiful than he is
[32:11] look at my side he was over the north
[32:14] which that's the worship part
[32:17] satan loves worship
[32:19] as i kept trying to tell you until him
[32:21] in tennessee
[32:22] satan don't want to go to the bars the
[32:24] bar flies
[32:26] the prostitutions the things like that
[32:28] he ain't out there right
[32:31] even if little wentz as we talked about
[32:33] the other day they don't even like being
[32:35] out there
[32:37] they like to go to church right
[32:43] they want to hear
[32:45] and you watch it
[32:49] a man starts moving especially when they
[32:51] come in this message he'll start moving
[32:53] and he begins to get a following the
[32:55] first thing you know people are just
[32:57] flocking to that following
[32:59] and boy he just straightened it out
[33:01] everybody
[33:03] you just tell him where everybody's
[33:05] wrong
[33:07] well then after a while you either see
[33:08] him settle down and just become one of
[33:11] us you know
[33:12] or either he
[33:14] goes back where he came from right or
[33:16] into the bed of adultery or whatever
[33:22] but wasn't it something for
[33:25] lucifer to think
[33:28] i'm god's right hand man
[33:32] i know all of his secrets
[33:35] he's confided in me
[33:37] these great secrets
[33:39] i know how to explain them
[33:45] what is it with the ones and the
[33:46] preachers in this message
[33:48] i once said one time he said you can
[33:50] call it two so whatever you want to he
[33:52] said i just believe what he said
[33:54] you know
[33:55] well
[33:58] wasn't it as i said a moment ago the
[34:01] fact that satan
[34:03] explained
[34:06] what he thought was god's plan to eve
[34:09] that's right
[34:14] and you know he told her she was made
[34:15] for that purpose you know what that's
[34:18] 99.99
[34:20] she was made for that purpose
[34:25] but the prophet said she mixed the wrong
[34:27] seed in the words too quick
[34:31] she was the one to have brought all of
[34:34] us into being right amen
[34:38] she was to reproduce adam
[34:48] how close to the truth
[34:52] but when satan then as he begin to
[34:55] explain to her about this as i've said
[34:58] many times to you
[35:00] then he begin to say adam and god won't
[35:03] tell you
[35:06] but let me tell you
[35:09] how to do this
[35:12] see then it went into the natural act
[35:15] right
[35:20] but
[35:23] but the rather said the church spoken
[35:25] words original seed that's not on the
[35:27] planet
[35:28] he said
[35:29] the church
[35:31] couldn't wait
[35:35] let me add a few words to it let's see
[35:37] what you think
[35:39] the bride can't wait for the true
[35:41] faithful ministry to get the word to
[35:44] preach it unto her
[35:50] i've never done away with your reading
[35:51] you're studying i've always encouraged
[35:53] you to read and study and pray and seek
[35:55] god and let god speak to you and you
[35:58] come and tell me what god's telling you
[36:00] and if it's right i'll amen what you're
[36:01] talking about right
[36:04] but the word comes to the faithful
[36:06] ministry after the prophet has brought
[36:08] it unto us
[36:10] amen but you see the women today ain't
[36:13] talking about when come at churches we
[36:15] can get it ourselves
[36:20] that's not a new one that's old it's
[36:23] the garden
[36:24] right
[36:26] but let me say just a few words here
[36:30] and then we'll get back down to
[36:32] something
[36:36] see the original lie
[36:40] that satan had according to genesis
[36:44] that he tried to explain to eve was
[36:50] you'll be his gods
[36:56] knowing good and evil
[36:59] now there's a lot to start with because
[37:00] god don't know good and evil right
[37:04] there is no part of god that could know
[37:06] evil he knows of evil
[37:09] but he doesn't know evil to no evil
[37:11] would have it to be part of you there is
[37:13] no part of god that evil could ever come
[37:15] from amen
[37:17] all right
[37:19] but that was satan's first words
[37:21] you'll be as god
[37:23] what was it in isaiah
[37:27] be like the most high right
[37:31] stronger than
[37:33] that
[37:34] but what is it in thessalonians
[37:38] showing himself to be
[37:40] as god
[37:42] sitting in the temple of god
[37:45] all right
[37:47] now
[37:48] let me emphasize something for a few
[37:50] minutes
[37:53] and see you're going to have to know
[37:54] whether you're right or not by your own
[37:56] holy ghost that's inside of you
[37:59] that's right
[38:00] if you don't have it there's no way to
[38:02] know
[38:03] except intellectually
[38:05] so we'll get back to that in a minute if
[38:06] you receive a knowledge of the truth and
[38:08] you turn away then where's your trouble
[38:10] but let me get this point across
[38:13] but brother dale
[38:15] you've always preached to us that we are
[38:19] god
[38:20] made
[38:21] manifest
[38:22] that's right
[38:23] we're not a second person
[38:26] amen amen we're not a third person
[38:29] we are god made manifest
[38:35] well how close is that to what satan
[38:37] says
[38:40] amen
[38:44] as god like god
[38:50] and then showing himself to be god
[38:55] what
[38:57] how close is that to the original truth
[39:04] don't remember satan's not the barfly
[39:06] guy
[39:08] he's a slicker in the pulpit right
[39:14] where his stronghold is
[39:16] you agree
[39:18] his stronghold is so strong in the
[39:20] pulpit until that's where he controls
[39:22] the people from that's right amen
[39:24] agree amen that's why the
[39:27] and doctrine see
[39:30] conquer the laity
[39:36] so lucifer would say don't you think
[39:38] yeah
[39:41] hey
[39:43] i'm supposed to be the number one guy
[39:48] i'm supposed to be god's right-hand man
[39:50] don't you believe that
[40:00] we're supposed to be the offspring of
[40:01] god right
[40:04] don't you believe that
[40:11] see it's all in your approach
[40:15] you approach that in one direction and
[40:16] you're
[40:17] antichrist
[40:20] you approach it in another direction
[40:22] in your jesus christ amen right
[40:27] how close is it
[40:31] it's up to you
[40:32] right
[40:35] you see it's like i've said it i've
[40:37] heard people uh especially the one
[40:39] brother that preaches the river jordan
[40:41] real strong i heard him preach a message
[40:44] one time that was so beautiful about the
[40:45] children of god
[40:47] the offspring of god and that we were
[40:49] not a second person we were always i
[40:51] mean my wife beat me to death with her
[40:53] elbow said where'd he get that
[40:57] you know
[41:00] i ain't saying he hurt it from me
[41:02] i'm saying all you gotta do is read the
[41:04] prophet's message and you'll see what
[41:05] i'm talking about
[41:07] you and the lady can read it and find
[41:08] out
[41:10] but then later he preached that jesus
[41:12] was the second person well jesus is the
[41:14] second person but you are the children
[41:17] of god that make you more a child of god
[41:19] than jesus would be because he'd be a
[41:21] second person it couldn't be
[41:24] a child of god
[41:26] simple
[41:31] but who's the most popular
[41:36] who's trying to be popular i'm trying to
[41:38] tell you the truth that's right i ain't
[41:39] trying to save the world we just opened
[41:41] up where they could hear
[41:45] anybody listening you've got a knob you
[41:46] can turn me off you can do what you want
[41:48] to that's no problem because they're
[41:50] going to make a dime a difference
[41:54] we're talking you're in this church
[41:57] i'm talking right here i'm talking about
[41:59] the unbelief here not the unbelief
[42:01] somewhere else that's none of my
[42:02] deadness
[42:05] how much are we
[42:07] really true believers
[42:08] is our confidence in the fifo ministry
[42:12] that's right
[42:14] in a way
[42:18] now you know what that means when you
[42:20] say in a way
[42:22] now jesus wasn't in the way
[42:25] he was the way
[42:27] so it's got to be talked about somebody
[42:29] else if you say in a way that might be
[42:31] right
[42:32] brother i believe you when you're saying
[42:33] that we are the offspring of god which
[42:36] means god in flesh
[42:38] but in a way now
[42:40] see that means you've got something in
[42:42] reserve
[42:44] that just in case that ain't exactly
[42:47] right
[42:50] then you ain't gonna stick your neck out
[42:58] what about it
[43:01] what do you believe about the offspring
[43:03] of god
[43:05] remember how close it is
[43:07] that's
[43:11] all right
[43:14] so let's just think about some things
[43:15] now
[43:19] let's consider something
[43:23] because i said it was the same lie that
[43:25] was told in heaven it's the same lie
[43:28] that was told even in the garden
[43:30] and then it would be the same lie that
[43:32] would come in to come into being in the
[43:34] end time
[43:35] through the preachers because i don't
[43:38] think i'm nobody
[43:41] i never had no trouble with that that's
[43:43] right
[43:44] it's preachers yep amen
[43:47] because preachers are not going to
[43:51] first off 90 of them are not going to
[43:53] tell you what they believe
[43:58] they're going to preach it and let you
[44:01] decide what they believe
[44:04] and then if you get it right
[44:06] you know
[44:08] oh they're on your side
[44:11] and the rest of the congregation just
[44:13] ain't caught the secret yet
[44:16] okay
[44:20] but if michael is christ
[44:27] and christ
[44:28] is the only protection we have
[44:35] and he works through the fifo ministry
[44:39] i didn't make these statements i didn't
[44:41] write the bible and i didn't say the
[44:44] things the prophet said
[44:46] he said to five full ministries for the
[44:48] perfecting the science to bring these
[44:50] things into the body of christ amen now
[44:53] the bible says that the prophet says
[44:55] that but where's the people at
[44:58] i'll just get it from the prophet
[45:01] well then the other side of it is i'm
[45:04] the guy that was to take over
[45:08] that ring of bell
[45:11] does that ring a bell what happened in
[45:13] heaven
[45:16] i'm supposed to be the one in charge
[45:23] how many people are preachers in this
[45:25] message
[45:27] come on
[45:30] when i first came in
[45:32] 1968
[45:36] the point then was was who do we follow
[45:42] came in 66 but i'm talking about when we
[45:44] really got on the end of the message
[45:48] first time at jeffersonville they were
[45:50] still trying to figure out who
[45:53] elijah was
[46:00] trying to figure out who is to take over
[46:04] and be in charge
[46:09] and i know they didn't like it because i
[46:11] thought i told myself i thought the
[46:12] bible said the fivefold ministry was for
[46:14] the perfecting of the saints i thought
[46:17] the fifo ministry was to
[46:19] take this message and break it down i
[46:21] didn't know it was a one-fold guy to run
[46:23] it right
[46:26] but how many want name
[46:29] around the world
[46:32] even in foreign countries that they
[46:34] believe that they were god and drive
[46:36] down here about 45 miles below us and
[46:39] pick up a guy and see what he thought
[46:41] about it
[46:53] but why then would we want to destroy
[46:58] it means there's got to be something
[47:00] about disbelieving
[47:02] and wasn't that the original sin right
[47:04] amen to disbelieve god's word
[47:07] the word says the five full ministries
[47:09] for the perfecting the saints
[47:11] the prophet said it was but where's the
[47:13] people
[47:16] more people are sitting at home
[47:17] listening to tapes than are in churches
[47:19] that's right and some that are sitting
[47:20] home tonight listen to tapes hey you're
[47:23] the ones i'm talking about so i'm sure
[47:25] we're telling you goodbye
[47:29] you know i'll wave at you on the
[47:30] internet in case you're watching it live
[47:32] you know
[47:34] i don't mean jokingly
[47:36] i want everybody to be there that's
[47:38] right i may be the devil because he
[47:40] wanted to save everybody
[47:42] you know brother dale might save
[47:44] everybody all right amen
[47:46] and i wish there was some way it could
[47:47] be done
[47:49] but then we realized it can't be coming
[47:54] satan tried to get eve to disbelieve
[47:57] what god said
[47:59] and believe what he said
[48:03] do you know that a man years ago
[48:06] indicted us
[48:10] they talked about brother brown that in
[48:11] doctors
[48:13] come on
[48:14] there's a man in this message that
[48:16] indicted us for believing brother
[48:17] branham
[48:21] but you know what
[48:22] they're still following him around the
[48:24] world
[48:26] and he wound up with two or three young
[48:28] girls up there
[48:30] moved to florida to keep being caught
[48:32] all over
[48:34] but you know what they still believe him
[48:46] he
[48:49] took the doctrine to take it to eve
[48:54] to try to get eve to believe who she was
[48:58] now they ain't a preacher's ever come
[48:59] forth in this message and i'll challenge
[49:01] you let's see if you can do it
[49:03] anyone that ever took a leadership and a
[49:05] doctrine and led off with it and all of
[49:07] the doctrinal issues and the things of
[49:09] believing their god and all that they
[49:11] didn't start out believing that right
[49:16] you know what they started out doing
[49:21] trying to get you to believe
[49:24] who you are
[49:29] look how close to the truth
[49:31] trying to get you to believe who you are
[49:35] we know what he said to he
[49:37] you'll be his god
[49:39] he didn't say i'm your god look at me
[49:42] but come on folks
[49:44] we ought to realize and this is where
[49:46] preachers don't do it preachers come
[49:48] along especially some that's come
[49:49] through here and they don't know
[49:52] the turkey as we call it about the
[49:53] message they say they don't and they
[49:56] stay here a while and they say they
[49:57] learned a whole lot and then they leave
[50:00] well
[50:02] how can you leave somebody that led you
[50:05] to the lord
[50:08] i mean come on
[50:12] but you see
[50:13] everybody after it comes up so far in
[50:15] them that they think they know
[50:17] everything
[50:24] that's why i always try to keep
[50:25] something danging in front of you
[50:30] it don't bother me
[50:33] to tell you
[50:34] that the lord revealed this to me the
[50:36] other day
[50:38] if you listen he'll reveal it to you
[50:42] don't bother me
[50:43] because that's god's channel you know
[50:45] why because i learned that away you know
[50:46] from other people that's right amen
[50:50] and i go constantly listening
[50:57] but satan tried to get eve to disbelieve
[51:00] the word
[51:05] because that's what he disbelieved
[51:07] right
[51:08] there stood the word which was christ
[51:12] come on is that right now did he move
[51:14] over in the form of the word theophany
[51:16] logos
[51:17] christ the son of god etcetera etcetera
[51:19] etcetera the child playing before their
[51:21] father's door the son of god
[51:26] that was who lucifer was trying to
[51:27] attack right
[51:32] and when he come to eve
[51:35] he was still using the same tactics
[51:38] and so is he using the same tactics
[51:41] today
[51:42] right
[51:43] now you got everything that's messaging
[51:45] you know from kooks to real good people
[51:48] but you notice those people in this
[51:51] message preachers
[51:52] you can't trust what brother brown says
[51:55] he changed here he changed our
[51:57] he missed it here he missed it there
[52:00] and you know where to con phrase that
[52:02] the phrase i conned out of it years ago
[52:06] if you straighten brother branham out
[52:08] just get your shoe off i want to kiss
[52:10] your toe because you've got to be
[52:11] almighty god
[52:13] because only god could straighten out a
[52:15] prophet
[52:21] but you know that ain't going to change
[52:22] nobody
[52:24] they didn't make one convert
[52:27] right probably made a lot of people
[52:28] think i exalted i thought it was
[52:33] but brother branham said
[52:35] eve
[52:37] was fortified going for letting that
[52:39] brother joe number three
[52:45] which is a big prayer of
[52:46] 160-162 with the second seal
[52:50] and look what he says
[52:53] the natural first bride of the human
[52:55] race before her husband came to her she
[52:57] fell by from grace by listening to
[52:59] satan's lie
[53:00] after he had fortified
[53:03] after
[53:05] after god had her fortified behind his
[53:08] word right
[53:09] and she was fortified behind the word
[53:11] right
[53:12] and he said don't move away now let me
[53:14] just go ahead and put it plain
[53:16] didn't in other words didn't he tell eve
[53:18] said if you need to know anything you
[53:20] need to talk to adam
[53:22] would that be true now am i degrading
[53:24] anybody your sisters you know come on
[53:27] now
[53:28] is that degrading to you
[53:33] he had her fortified behind the word
[53:35] he had adam there to be her
[53:40] real true have meant
[53:43] if she needed to know anything she
[53:45] should have went to him
[53:48] but of course like women preachers we
[53:51] can get it too you know
[53:53] all right
[53:55] but look
[53:57] if she'd have stayed behind the word
[53:59] she'd have never failed
[54:02] now that's in the natural nature see the
[54:04] natural woman and what was the curse the
[54:07] actual curse of coming out from behind
[54:09] god's word
[54:11] and remember she believed about 98
[54:15] of it
[54:17] but you just have to leave
[54:20] one thing go
[54:22] look how close one thing though
[54:26] see she believed a whole lot of it oh
[54:29] certainly
[54:30] she said
[54:32] this
[54:33] second admit it that's right
[54:35] if he could just get you on one corner
[54:40] that's all he wants
[54:42] only thing you have to do is give
[54:45] the bullet a little twist
[54:47] this way and it'll miss the target see
[54:50] that's all now she's believed so much of
[54:54] it but yet missed it
[54:57] and what's the results
[54:59] the whole human rights
[55:04] all that she took was
[55:07] you shall not die
[55:12] and god said she would
[55:16] see she still believes he's right
[55:19] right the church
[55:22] still believes she's right
[55:24] all right
[55:25] look at the next one
[55:27] we have a true prophet 1963 paragraph
[55:30] 238
[55:37] you know
[55:38] you you have to deny the truth before
[55:41] you can believe a lie
[55:45] amen
[55:46] okay
[55:47] that's right
[55:48] that's exactly
[55:50] he first had to deny god's word
[55:53] for she could take satan's lie
[55:57] they had to get away from the word then
[56:00] now watch this reading here
[56:02] sign now
[56:05] letting rome
[56:10] now we're spread around covering
[56:13] letting wrong take over without firing
[56:16] shot
[56:19] they don't know the word of god about
[56:21] these things that's what the trouble is
[56:23] what's he saying
[56:26] read that
[56:30] you gotta
[56:32] deny the truth before you can believe a
[56:34] lie
[56:37] so it's what she done
[56:39] what did rome do at nicaea
[56:41] what did rome wrong do it the first and
[56:43] i see in council
[56:46] you see what he's saying
[56:50] letting rome take over without firing a
[56:53] shot
[56:58] you know the devil is not a uh
[57:02] you know the devil's real slow fly
[57:05] moves real slow
[57:08] as i've told you it took from 3 25 a.d
[57:13] to first nazi and council
[57:15] that they developed that jesus was a
[57:17] light substance
[57:22] not meaning he was the substance see
[57:25] because they had it would have stayed
[57:26] with the truth
[57:28] and it took to 606
[57:32] before the trinity concept
[57:34] was really
[57:37] almost 300 years
[57:40] that's right
[57:43] and you know why satan done that with
[57:45] pictures
[57:50] little small doctrines and pictures
[57:56] because that's what he used
[58:00] a drawing
[58:02] in his first drawing he had
[58:05] mary holding jesus and a halo around
[58:08] jesus
[58:11] well after a little while he just makes
[58:13] a couple of light strokes up above
[58:15] mary's head you know
[58:20] and after a while another picture comes
[58:22] out first thing you know that just as
[58:24] big a halo around mary his ears around
[58:28] jesus
[58:30] hundreds of years
[58:33] to develop that trinity
[58:37] he's got patience
[58:40] satan's got patience
[58:42] he knows how to wait
[58:44] but look
[58:47] you've got to first deny the truth
[58:50] so now here's where the scripture is
[58:53] there must be a falling light
[58:55] and if there must be a falling away you
[58:57] got to be somewhere to fall
[59:00] all right so the truth would have to
[59:02] come forth
[59:04] before you can fall away from that truth
[59:09] see this is the only age where the truth
[59:11] has come
[59:14] the full truth
[59:18] you say no the book of acts
[59:20] paul didn't understand what we
[59:22] understand about
[59:23] the thing
[59:24] come on
[59:25] quote brother branham so you do what you
[59:27] want to
[59:30] see they didn't know back there what we
[59:32] know now
[59:33] that's right i'm sorry they didn't have
[59:35] the opening of the seals and the things
[59:37] about where the prophet to bring right
[59:39] amen
[59:40] i didn't say there was an era
[59:42] i didn't say that was even in false
[59:44] doctrine but you know yourself that the
[59:47] very first church age was what thou is
[59:51] is the one that now has left thy first
[59:53] love right amen
[59:56] that's right
[59:59] brother brown emphasized like he said
[1:00:01] said i wish you'd get back to it but he
[1:00:03] said in that very first beginning said
[1:00:06] they would look the people in the eye
[1:00:07] and say you're not saying what paul said
[1:00:09] that by your antichrist
[1:00:24] you've got to hear the truth before you
[1:00:25] can fall away
[1:00:28] so this is the warning to rule the
[1:00:29] church
[1:00:33] we talk about the word the amount the uh
[1:00:37] the volume or what you want to call it
[1:00:39] that the church at lula stands upon the
[1:00:41] word
[1:00:44] then that way it means we're the closest
[1:00:46] ones
[1:00:47] if you want to argue that you're the one
[1:00:49] that said it i didn't
[1:00:53] so that means that we can fall quicker
[1:00:55] than the others
[1:00:57] because a lot of the others ain't
[1:00:59] reached that yet right
[1:01:00] right
[1:01:03] so we have the ability to fall
[1:01:10] greater than others so don't grow don't
[1:01:13] crow so much about what you know
[1:01:20] look at the next one divine healing
[1:01:21] 1954.
[1:01:24] and we'll have to do this one kind of
[1:01:25] like what he did the other night
[1:01:27] on the evening service he was talking
[1:01:29] about the
[1:01:30] the uh
[1:01:32] forming ladder rains and the different
[1:01:33] things you know how this with that and
[1:01:35] that with that
[1:01:37] now before we start on this
[1:01:39] before we get into it
[1:01:41] the prophet i told you to start with
[1:01:43] it's impossible for a christian the
[1:01:45] prophet said
[1:01:46] to
[1:01:47] disbelieve god's word you know and be
[1:01:50] lost right
[1:01:52] then we talk about what is the black
[1:01:55] theme in the holy ghost
[1:01:58] and we call it the unpardonable sin
[1:02:01] and the prophet said it was to make
[1:02:03] light or
[1:02:05] you know
[1:02:06] of someone with the holy ghost on them
[1:02:08] and
[1:02:10] bring it down in simplicity
[1:02:12] now look where he starts off here with
[1:02:14] the unpardonable sin maybe not on this
[1:02:15] one but look up in the next quote
[1:02:19] let's just see what it is
[1:02:22] that you and i can do
[1:02:25] now we read in the scriptures
[1:02:30] if we sin willfully after receiving the
[1:02:31] knowledge of the truth there are remains
[1:02:33] no more sacrifice
[1:02:40] i didn't write that
[1:02:43] but look what your prophet had to say
[1:02:46] he that sins will flesh receiving the
[1:02:48] knowledge of the truth there are laments
[1:02:49] no more sacrifice for sin hebrews 10 i
[1:02:52] believe 47. is that right he that sins
[1:02:54] willfully after receiving the knowledge
[1:02:56] of the truth that remains no more
[1:02:58] sacrifice for sin but a fearful looking
[1:03:00] for the fire to the judgment and fiery
[1:03:03] indignation which shall devour the
[1:03:05] adversary
[1:03:07] now he that what willfully
[1:03:09] he that sins
[1:03:11] and what is sin unbelief
[1:03:14] he that will turn his back on truth
[1:03:17] when it's presented to him
[1:03:19] there remaineth no more sacrifice for
[1:03:21] sin
[1:03:23] okay
[1:03:25] did you ever read it that
[1:03:27] like that
[1:03:28] he that disbelieves willfully after
[1:03:31] truth has been presented to him
[1:03:34] because his church believes different
[1:03:36] that's when you cross the line he that
[1:03:38] sins willfully actually
[1:03:40] after he has received the knowledge of
[1:03:42] the truth there remaineth no more
[1:03:43] sacrifice
[1:03:47] he that sins willfully acts receiving
[1:03:49] the knowledge of the truth
[1:03:52] and to receive the knowledge of the
[1:03:53] truth means you've got to hear the truth
[1:03:56] amen
[1:04:04] how many people have you talked to
[1:04:11] come on
[1:04:13] how many people have you talked to
[1:04:16] that people have turned you down
[1:04:18] right
[1:04:22] when you tried to tell them the truth
[1:04:24] right
[1:04:28] see i like to do that
[1:04:29] because that way you can't throw it all
[1:04:31] back up here and sit there and grin at
[1:04:33] me or look at me and all kind of things
[1:04:36] and say yeah you talk about yourself
[1:04:38] no i like to talk about you
[1:04:41] how many people have you told the truth
[1:04:44] right and they turned your name
[1:04:48] how many times you ever talked to
[1:04:49] anybody about water baptism
[1:04:52] right your simple water baptism
[1:04:54] that's right
[1:04:55] yep that's it
[1:04:58] they say my church don't teach that
[1:05:01] what are you getting upset for
[1:05:03] they just read it
[1:05:05] you say what revealed to him it doesn't
[1:05:08] say that come on folks
[1:05:11] receiving the knowledge of the truth is
[1:05:13] not to have a revelation of the truth
[1:05:16] that's right
[1:05:17] it is a knowledge
[1:05:19] that's right
[1:05:20] a knowledge is is something that is
[1:05:23] laying in front of you
[1:05:25] that you can't argue about right
[1:05:29] well in a way i guess you could be right
[1:05:32] he said anyway i'll tell you what the
[1:05:34] bible says right amen
[1:05:38] you say are you judging those people no
[1:05:40] no god judges the people
[1:05:43] i don't have anything to do with it you
[1:05:44] don't have anything to do with it you
[1:05:45] just tried your best to help them
[1:05:47] you want to save them don't
[1:05:49] well you know you can't say well if you
[1:05:50] keep it in your pocket right
[1:05:53] right
[1:05:55] you sit down on it
[1:05:57] like brother ernie i really thought that
[1:05:59] man made a point brother ernie going
[1:06:01] away we were talking about that feller
[1:06:03] that he'd known him for quite a while
[1:06:06] the man come up to him one day and said
[1:06:07] you mean you've known about william
[1:06:08] branham all these years and hadn't told
[1:06:10] me about it
[1:06:12] yeah right
[1:06:14] so we can sit down put it in our pocket
[1:06:15] and say we don't want to hurt feelings
[1:06:21] well i guess you'd rather the person
[1:06:22] burning hell
[1:06:24] then if you'd hurt your feelings
[1:06:26] i'm fine
[1:06:29] but not arrogant
[1:06:32] you see we can justify within ourselves
[1:06:34] right and say well i i just don't i just
[1:06:37] won't talk to nobody because i don't
[1:06:38] want to offend them
[1:06:39] well you know i wonder what would happen
[1:06:41] if somebody had to come to you that's
[1:06:43] right right and a lot of times the thing
[1:06:45] did you
[1:06:47] right
[1:06:48] first time you heard it you got upset
[1:06:51] you didn't like it you know you
[1:06:55] right
[1:06:57] see brother after you talk because he's
[1:06:59] been around you a long time i've seen a
[1:07:01] lot of you come up the line shouting and
[1:07:03] hollering and kicking and fighting
[1:07:07] okay
[1:07:10] but what about it
[1:07:14] see we can fall away
[1:07:18] because we know the knowledge
[1:07:20] of the truth
[1:07:22] that's right
[1:07:26] brother explained it come on now he said
[1:07:28] that's a borderline believer
[1:07:30] that was the guys that went over and got
[1:07:32] the grapes and come back
[1:07:35] borderline believer
[1:07:38] those that was facing it at cadence
[1:07:40] barnea they could see the grapes and
[1:07:42] couldn't eat the graves right
[1:07:44] and they could hear ten guys telling the
[1:07:46] truth and two guys lying and wait said
[1:07:48] them ten line preachers that's right
[1:07:50] i mean two telling the truth and tim
[1:07:52] line
[1:07:54] but look at the next one
[1:07:57] to see jesus program
[1:08:00] e43 41 1954
[1:08:02] look what he said
[1:08:04] drinking smoking gambling doing evil
[1:08:07] things that isn't sin that's your
[1:08:09] attributes of unbelief you do that
[1:08:10] because you're an unbeliever
[1:08:12] if you was a believer you would not do
[1:08:14] those things it bears the fruits now
[1:08:17] what's the truth it bears the fruits of
[1:08:18] joy peace long suffering gentleman's
[1:08:20] face with me that's the fruits of the
[1:08:22] spirit but the fruits of the evil spirit
[1:08:24] is doubt
[1:08:26] he that believeth not is condemned
[1:08:28] already
[1:08:29] then if the truth comes to you in such a
[1:08:31] way that you have a knowledge of it
[1:08:33] and then you receive refuse to receive
[1:08:36] it there remains no more sacrifice for
[1:08:38] for
[1:08:39] your sin
[1:08:41] but a fearful looking forward to the
[1:08:42] judgment
[1:08:47] what is it then
[1:08:52] if the truth comes to you in such a way
[1:08:56] that you have a knowledge
[1:08:59] you know what you see is right
[1:09:01] right
[1:09:03] now come on just be quiet sensible with
[1:09:05] us you know and i try to be that with
[1:09:07] you now you know yourself that even it
[1:09:09] doesn't matter what church it is the
[1:09:11] simplicity of brother brown explaining
[1:09:13] one god
[1:09:14] should have been received by everybody
[1:09:16] right amen
[1:09:17] right and especially the water baptism
[1:09:20] when he said it don't take a revelation
[1:09:21] right it just right here and he said we
[1:09:23] can show you in the history where they
[1:09:25] changed it at the word that it didn't
[1:09:27] used to be father son holy ghost it was
[1:09:29] lord jesus christ all of this and the
[1:09:30] other
[1:09:33] and that's simple in it
[1:09:38] why didn't they receive it
[1:09:44] because it would cost them
[1:09:46] their church
[1:09:47] their families their things
[1:09:52] but you have to have knowledge that was
[1:09:53] right
[1:09:55] i told you about the man at work down
[1:09:56] there i talked to him about it he said
[1:09:58] the lord spoke to him and told him to
[1:09:59] get baptized name the lord jesus christ
[1:10:02] he said all right now you get it done
[1:10:04] here
[1:10:05] so i came into work maybe a few months
[1:10:07] later
[1:10:10] he said got baptized
[1:10:13] over the weekend
[1:10:14] i smoke praise the lord
[1:10:18] he said yeah i should call his name
[1:10:22] said he baptized me
[1:10:24] and i thought
[1:10:26] hold on just a minute let him finish
[1:10:31] he said baptize me both ways
[1:10:37] i said before you say another word i
[1:10:38] want to tell you how you got baptized
[1:10:41] hold it don't say nothing i said that
[1:10:44] man baptized you
[1:10:46] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:10:49] and then he baptized you and father son
[1:10:51] and holy ghost am i right he said
[1:10:53] exactly i said you don't have no baptism
[1:10:56] at all you erased everything you've done
[1:10:57] right
[1:10:59] he withdrew from he wouldn't have
[1:11:01] anything to do with me
[1:11:04] but see i knew that man was a methodist
[1:11:06] preacher and with no way in the world
[1:11:07] he's going to baptize him in the name of
[1:11:08] the lord jesus christ
[1:11:13] but you say when a man was just sincere
[1:11:16] that's what i told him
[1:11:18] i said if you're sincere
[1:11:20] why didn't you have him to baptize you
[1:11:22] father son and holy god and then lord
[1:11:25] jesus christ
[1:11:26] i said because you know he went and done
[1:11:27] it
[1:11:30] i said you've been right back with me
[1:11:31] and i've had it done
[1:11:36] but you see the lord spoke to him
[1:11:40] and he's what he said
[1:11:44] so he received the knowledge of the
[1:11:46] truth
[1:11:47] that's right
[1:11:53] and be totally in disobedience look at
[1:11:55] the next
[1:11:57] the unpardonable sin it'd be good to
[1:11:59] take this whole message and read it
[1:12:02] paragraph 120 1954
[1:12:07] here's the whole
[1:12:08] capping off of every verse in the bible
[1:12:11] that's beautiful isn't it
[1:12:13] in other words he's going to sum up the
[1:12:14] whole bible right and he's going to cap
[1:12:16] it off
[1:12:17] right
[1:12:20] we'll just take it in a few minutes to
[1:12:21] show you that every place it was full of
[1:12:24] of the unpardonable sin
[1:12:27] unpardonable sin
[1:12:29] then paul comes over here to cap it off
[1:12:32] said if we sin willfully after we have
[1:12:34] received the knowledge of the truth
[1:12:35] there remains no more sacrifice for sin
[1:12:39] then that's got to be the unpardonable
[1:12:42] sin
[1:12:43] is sinning willfully
[1:12:45] is that right he that sins willfully now
[1:12:47] what is sin the next thing you have to
[1:12:49] find out what is sin sin is disobedience
[1:12:52] sin is rejecting now look here the first
[1:12:54] sin
[1:12:56] unpardonable sin
[1:13:03] now brother branham
[1:13:06] says we will even willfully do things
[1:13:08] wrong
[1:13:11] it's christian
[1:13:17] but what's willfully doing things wrong
[1:13:19] as christians
[1:13:22] you better not have nothing to deal with
[1:13:23] the word
[1:13:27] it better be this life and doings and
[1:13:30] you know
[1:13:33] you remember that i've teached many
[1:13:35] times on the works of the flesh
[1:13:38] that a christian has works of the flesh
[1:13:41] but they better not have fruits of the
[1:13:43] flesh because we do the lost right amen
[1:13:46] the works of the flesh can be in all of
[1:13:48] us
[1:13:50] amen
[1:13:51] you could go out today and get a temper
[1:13:54] tantrum strike and you kill somebody
[1:13:55] you're a murderer according to the bible
[1:13:57] no murderer goes to heaven
[1:13:59] but did you do it wrongfully or what was
[1:14:01] it
[1:14:05] so what is the unpardonable sin
[1:14:09] rejecting god's word
[1:14:11] somebody presents the truth to you
[1:14:14] and you turn it down because of what
[1:14:16] somebody else says
[1:14:19] first off that would be a very carnal
[1:14:21] thing to have is to to not be able to
[1:14:23] have something on your own
[1:14:26] why can't you stand on your own two feet
[1:14:29] that's right amen
[1:14:32] that way you can either say i'm lost or
[1:14:33] saved
[1:14:34] and it'll work
[1:14:38] but you know what the bible said no man
[1:14:39] can call jesus christ except it be by
[1:14:41] the holy ghost a personal experience
[1:14:43] inside of you because if not then you're
[1:14:45] saying what somebody else says right
[1:14:47] does that mean you're saved no
[1:14:50] you're only saying what they're saying
[1:14:52] see that our knowledge of the truth is
[1:14:54] not a revelation of the truth
[1:14:57] amen it's a knowledge
[1:15:02] you remember back there a while ago when
[1:15:03] i was trying to illustrate a little bit
[1:15:06] that god has only one way of doing
[1:15:08] things
[1:15:11] satan wanted to do it another way
[1:15:17] so he disbelieved god
[1:15:20] why wouldn't he stay with the original
[1:15:21] plan
[1:15:24] to reject the revealed word
[1:15:29] that's the next one
[1:15:30] which is still in the unpardonable sin
[1:15:32] this is paragraph 122 that was 120.
[1:15:35] to reject the revealed word
[1:15:38] now look what he says
[1:15:42] he said even webster in other words if
[1:15:44] you look at his footnotes he said he
[1:15:45] said that sin is rejecting the revealed
[1:15:47] word of god sin in its initial form is
[1:15:50] to reject the revealed word of god
[1:15:53] what god our will of god
[1:15:56] will have god's word right when god has
[1:15:58] revealed something as his will and to
[1:16:00] reject that is to blaspheme
[1:16:05] or to reject god
[1:16:07] what was the first sin let's look it up
[1:16:09] you go back here in genesis 3. you may
[1:16:11] read it when you get home if you want to
[1:16:13] genesis 3 when god put the garden of
[1:16:15] eden
[1:16:17] put adam and eve in there he told them
[1:16:20] things that they
[1:16:22] that was his word that they could do and
[1:16:25] things they could not do
[1:16:31] notice when satan come to eve he said
[1:16:33] god hath said
[1:16:36] thy shall not eat in there but surely
[1:16:38] thou shalt not die i see
[1:16:40] then eve willfully you get it
[1:16:42] he willfully doing something that she
[1:16:45] knew god said not to do
[1:16:48] is that right
[1:16:50] now look at it when you see willfully
[1:16:52] the first sin that was ever committed
[1:16:54] what
[1:16:55] this
[1:16:56] was her willfully
[1:17:00] continued
[1:17:03] she already just walked over there to
[1:17:05] adam and said adam
[1:17:07] this thing over here talking to me
[1:17:11] but no
[1:17:18] i wouldn't make a remark about most of
[1:17:20] the women of this message but would it
[1:17:22] help because most of the women in this
[1:17:23] mess are not going to listen to their
[1:17:25] husband
[1:17:27] is that going to change
[1:17:28] anything because they think you're right
[1:17:33] and you know about a lot of things they
[1:17:34] are
[1:17:36] that's right
[1:17:37] but we're talking about the word
[1:17:40] amen
[1:17:42] don't you think that that brother and
[1:17:43] sister is good people
[1:17:45] yeah
[1:17:47] when i found out one day one day the
[1:17:48] prophet said hell is going to be full of
[1:17:50] good people
[1:17:52] and we may be a lot of them that's going
[1:17:53] to be there good people
[1:17:58] but now he got down to use blaspheme
[1:18:00] unpardonable
[1:18:03] he said what i always thought blaspheme
[1:18:05] was to to make lighter to to do yeah but
[1:18:07] it's all you got to do is just say that
[1:18:09] i don't believe what that preacher says
[1:18:11] right
[1:18:13] and if that preacher's telling the truth
[1:18:15] what have you done
[1:18:16] that's right
[1:18:18] yes sir
[1:18:20] well there's any hope for me the only
[1:18:22] hopes is back in god's word
[1:18:26] and remember if you are truly born again
[1:18:28] you cannot do it because something will
[1:18:31] stop you
[1:18:33] right
[1:18:34] now come on
[1:18:36] we ought to be human enough to realize
[1:18:38] that sometimes things does talk to us
[1:18:40] and tell us not to do things
[1:18:44] right you know we'll listen to it right
[1:18:47] brother brown said quote
[1:18:50] if there is any doubt
[1:18:53] about what you're fixing to do
[1:18:57] he says don't do it right
[1:19:03] that's simple
[1:19:07] all you got to do is paragraph 125 with
[1:19:09] the same message
[1:19:11] because joe
[1:19:12] number nine
[1:19:16] all you got to do is say one thing then
[1:19:18] what is sin
[1:19:19] he talks about saint john the third
[1:19:20] chapter in a moment he that believeth
[1:19:23] not is condemned already is that right
[1:19:25] then sin is actually unbelief now we we
[1:19:27] want to get that
[1:19:29] uh uh
[1:19:30] believe it or not it's condemned
[1:19:32] we got that as a the people that don't
[1:19:34] know nothing don't haven't heard nothing
[1:19:36] don't know anything about it
[1:19:38] is that where our minds run
[1:19:41] you better get it on over close to where
[1:19:42] we're at that's right
[1:19:44] come on
[1:19:45] see that sin is actually unbelief
[1:19:47] satan and his enticement to eve told me
[1:19:50] that god said that but he didn't mean it
[1:19:54] see how he whitewashed the word
[1:19:56] well now he said now god said it but he
[1:19:59] didn't mean it in other words you'll be
[1:20:02] our eyes will be open
[1:20:04] you will
[1:20:05] know
[1:20:06] know a lot more knowledge
[1:20:08] okay
[1:20:09] and now that same rotten lie is told by
[1:20:12] satan to preachers
[1:20:14] and church members today to say the word
[1:20:17] of god says so and so but it don't mean
[1:20:20] that
[1:20:22] god's word means exactly what it's
[1:20:25] saying right
[1:20:28] brother i know he said that but he
[1:20:30] didn't mean that but what did he mean
[1:20:36] who gave you the right to tell us what
[1:20:37] it meant
[1:20:40] i thought a prophet stood before god and
[1:20:42] god only amen
[1:20:45] i thought brother brown even told us
[1:20:46] that you just said the way i said
[1:20:48] because i'll be responsible
[1:20:50] and you know what i've always told you
[1:20:52] if you didn't know the message didn't
[1:20:53] have all the message or anything you
[1:20:55] know that brother around his way was
[1:20:56] bringing out something that brought
[1:20:58] around tall
[1:20:59] and
[1:21:00] you know what the white horse rider was
[1:21:02] the holy ghost sure
[1:21:06] you know if you've been back there going
[1:21:08] around the country preaching that
[1:21:11] run around and would have shook your
[1:21:12] hand said brother tell it like it is
[1:21:19] come on
[1:21:22] he was deceived
[1:21:24] brother and i want to say boy let's
[1:21:25] start off listen you know more goodbye
[1:21:28] right
[1:21:29] no problem
[1:21:32] now you go read the book and see whether
[1:21:34] he was deceived or not
[1:21:36] he said i'd have made a horrible mistake
[1:21:38] if a holy ghost had to come in the room
[1:21:40] to correct me on when i fixed the preach
[1:21:44] but once that was preached
[1:21:46] if you still didn't know the truth and
[1:21:48] you also were not able to receive you
[1:21:50] were still okay
[1:21:53] but when somebody come along and said
[1:21:54] here brother brown
[1:21:56] you listen to this tape he corrected
[1:21:58] that
[1:21:59] you better not preach it the other way
[1:22:01] anymore
[1:22:02] amen because you're an unbeliever
[1:22:06] unbelief in god which is the word you
[1:22:08] don't have to pull up now joe that's
[1:22:10] number 10. i sent you one
[1:22:14] brother
[1:22:15] oh bro next okay okay i'll get sorry
[1:22:18] about that
[1:22:20] i just know until y'all in the room
[1:22:24] all right
[1:22:27] which is the word he made me do it he
[1:22:28] got it
[1:22:30] but listen
[1:22:31] all right all that's well and good
[1:22:34] lord i know what sin is
[1:22:36] more to see how it is and where the day
[1:22:38] and the hour that we're living in the
[1:22:39] time
[1:22:40] we're going to see that we're the only
[1:22:42] people that can really be caught into
[1:22:44] the position of being able to fall away
[1:22:47] right
[1:22:54] but i don't never like to leave anything
[1:22:55] behind me
[1:22:57] pull a license brother
[1:23:02] this is what i like to bring
[1:23:08] read
[1:23:11] we find now
[1:23:12] this evil age
[1:23:15] is to prove to satan
[1:23:17] she is not like ever
[1:23:21] she is not that type of woman
[1:23:24] and she will be tried
[1:23:27] by the word
[1:23:30] what do you think's been going on for 40
[1:23:32] years
[1:23:36] the man said she
[1:23:39] is going to prove to satan
[1:23:41] she who the bride
[1:23:48] can you believe
[1:23:50] something
[1:23:52] that is not true
[1:23:54] if you are a child of god
[1:24:04] come on
[1:24:06] you mean you've got the holy ghost
[1:24:09] but yet you believe that
[1:24:11] the two lords might be right or the
[1:24:14] seven thunder virtues might be right or
[1:24:15] the river jordan guys might be right or
[1:24:18] you mean you're still so sympathetic
[1:24:20] with all of that unbelief that's right
[1:24:22] come on
[1:24:26] i thought the holy ghost was to lead us
[1:24:28] into the truth
[1:24:33] and according to what your prophet just
[1:24:34] said
[1:24:37] he said the bride is going to prove
[1:24:42] he tells you about what eve happened and
[1:24:44] what happened you go to spoken word
[1:24:46] original seed he tells you what happened
[1:24:47] to the early church ages right
[1:24:50] but there's got to be a bride in the end
[1:24:52] time that's going to stay with god's
[1:24:54] word
[1:24:57] no matter what anybody says
[1:25:03] she's just gonna take god's word and
[1:25:04] keep on walking that's right
[1:25:07] i ain't got time to fuss and argue with
[1:25:09] nobody i preach here
[1:25:13] anybody out there wants to listen that's
[1:25:14] your problem you you've heard the
[1:25:16] knowledge of the truth so if you don't
[1:25:18] believe it you're a sinner
[1:25:20] goodbye
[1:25:23] because i can't do anything about it
[1:25:25] because i don't want nobody to be lost
[1:25:29] i want to preach to the bride of jesus
[1:25:31] christ
[1:25:33] and i want satan to know
[1:25:36] that he's been in the battle amen
[1:25:42] i don't want to face god with a little
[1:25:44] 65 two lords seven thunder virtue
[1:25:47] perusias son of man seven thunders all
[1:25:49] kind of doctrines that are around in
[1:25:51] this message
[1:25:54] that even a a 10 year old kid could take
[1:25:56] the prophet's message and show them
[1:25:58] where they're wrong
[1:25:59] if they listen to him
[1:26:06] i want to go down and fight
[1:26:10] i want the devil to know that i ain't on
[1:26:11] his side
[1:26:14] right that's right
[1:26:15] i wouldn't believe that that ain't on
[1:26:17] his side
[1:26:19] and it ain't gonna give up
[1:26:21] right
[1:26:24] but why is it you can't believe that the
[1:26:26] holy ghost can keep you straight amen
[1:26:28] i'm afraid to listen to anybody else
[1:26:30] because i'm not getting all confused no
[1:26:31] you're already confused
[1:26:33] you might listen to somebody else and
[1:26:34] find out you're already confused
[1:26:36] that's what the preachers say let's say
[1:26:38] these simple things now
[1:26:40] well isn't that doing what i said a
[1:26:42] while ago isn't that destroying their
[1:26:44] very savior
[1:26:53] right
[1:26:56] is it destroying your savior
[1:27:00] when you won't listen to someone else
[1:27:07] what about it church
[1:27:13] there must needs to be heresy among you
[1:27:15] that they that are approved may be made
[1:27:17] manifest that's right
[1:27:20] ain't no need to bring it off the street
[1:27:21] now let's get straight in here to where
[1:27:23] we prove what's wrong with it no
[1:27:25] don't worry about it satan will try
[1:27:30] and real good brother years ago
[1:27:34] preached here many times
[1:27:39] i was gone when we came and invited him
[1:27:40] to come down
[1:27:42] he preached two lords to the team
[1:27:49] you're no better
[1:27:54] you ought to know better as a brother
[1:27:58] i'm not going somewhere else when i know
[1:27:59] somebody's contrary to what i believe
[1:28:01] about predestination one god what about
[1:28:04] i mean i'm not worried about this
[1:28:06] so really
[1:28:07] you know i'm not going to preach that
[1:28:09] right
[1:28:11] i'm a brother when i went to jamaica i
[1:28:14] told that pastor that was over our
[1:28:15] pentecostal preacher
[1:28:19] i said brother branham taught us not to
[1:28:21] do that
[1:28:23] he said well there's two brothers came
[1:28:24] here and really messed up a lot of
[1:28:25] things and i called her names because he
[1:28:27] told me
[1:28:31] i said but you won't you're looking at a
[1:28:32] man that won't teach nothing no
[1:28:34] different i said now i'm not going to
[1:28:35] compromise
[1:28:37] with you or nobody
[1:28:39] i said what i preach i'll preach it to
[1:28:41] the letter and straight to the truth
[1:28:45] but you're going to determine how far i
[1:28:47] go
[1:28:48] because i will honor your pulpit as our
[1:28:51] prophet taught us to do
[1:28:53] amen he said teach all you want to
[1:28:56] anything you want to on the morning
[1:28:58] service
[1:28:59] he said the only thing i do is ask you
[1:29:01] at night to keep it more simple said
[1:29:03] because
[1:29:05] it won't be my people it'll be people
[1:29:07] all over the
[1:29:08] island well some of you was there and
[1:29:11] heard what went on
[1:29:13] i preached one god so straight
[1:29:17] and they rejoiced to the tea about it
[1:29:20] i didn't have to back up
[1:29:24] but i still wasn't going to go contrary
[1:29:28] that's not the spirit of christ
[1:29:32] man told brother branham one time said
[1:29:34] brother brown said you know
[1:29:36] that most of my people are legalists
[1:29:39] in other words if you would you know
[1:29:42] honor that
[1:29:43] he said i loved the man
[1:29:46] because he loved his people
[1:29:52] but preachers you know how to bless god
[1:29:54] i've got my time and i'm gonna tell it
[1:29:57] well
[1:29:58] now where did jesus do that right where
[1:30:01] did brother branham do that
[1:30:09] truth is true
[1:30:12] but truth is not made to fight with
[1:30:17] truth is made to be lived
[1:30:20] not argued about come on that's right
[1:30:23] what is sin
[1:30:27] any idea or thought
[1:30:29] that i have contrary to god's word
[1:30:32] and i hope he's listening to the reason
[1:30:34] i gave it all the way through
[1:30:35] because you see if we turn down the
[1:30:37] bible ministry we've turned down part of
[1:30:39] the word of god
[1:30:42] if we reject the faithful ministry we
[1:30:44] reject god's plan
[1:30:50] but if a sister comes and tells you the
[1:30:52] truth
[1:30:56] you better listen
[1:30:59] donald donkey straightened a profit out
[1:31:00] one day
[1:31:03] a rooster crowed
[1:31:05] to correct the preacher
[1:31:11] if we ever get to the place that we
[1:31:13] can't hear what other people has to say
[1:31:14] about it and brother brown said what did
[1:31:16] he say most people do he said they're
[1:31:18] only listening for you to shut up where
[1:31:20] they can refute what you're saying
[1:31:22] that's his word
[1:31:24] amen
[1:31:28] go home and think about it what is sin
[1:31:31] how simple is it to be a sinner
[1:31:34] from being disbelieved anything brother
[1:31:36] brown said
[1:31:37] i'm a sinner
[1:31:42] i know he talked daniel 70 weeks but i
[1:31:44] just can't i just don't don't believe it
[1:31:49] find somebody that does
[1:31:54] listen
[1:31:56] all right
[1:32:03] we're going to get down down and start
[1:32:04] over in genesis okay
[1:32:08] we're going to preach about that last
[1:32:09] quote brother around said that there's a
[1:32:12] bride in the last day is going to stand
[1:32:14] on god's word
[1:32:17] and no matter what anybody says or does
[1:32:19] she's going to stay with me and she's
[1:32:21] going to prove to satan
[1:32:24] brother branham you said we could live
[1:32:26] so close to god to the devil didn't know
[1:32:28] what to do with us
[1:32:30] that's what he said that's right
[1:32:36] just keep quoting the word that's
[1:32:39] that's right amen when he comes to you
[1:32:40] something says what's the word saying
[1:32:44] oh beautiful but what's the word say
[1:32:48] dreams and things why did the lady have
[1:32:50] it the man had to dream and he said run
[1:32:52] around i'll straighten you out on this
[1:32:54] thing
[1:32:55] yes
[1:32:57] brother was talking to him because he
[1:32:58] was traveling about the country with
[1:32:59] this woman and had a bad reputation
[1:33:03] the man said i'll straighten you out on
[1:33:05] that
[1:33:06] i had a dream first i think doing that a
[1:33:09] vision for everyone said he saw it was a
[1:33:10] dream
[1:33:13] and i saw my wife running around and
[1:33:15] then she'd come back and i just love her
[1:33:17] and i just you know over and over and
[1:33:18] over
[1:33:21] he said now your dream
[1:33:24] is not right
[1:33:29] two people think it's so beautiful
[1:33:32] they said it can't be right
[1:33:37] it doesn't matter if it's visions dreams
[1:33:39] or whatever we have
[1:33:40] her word of the lord
[1:33:43] you better compare with the rest of the
[1:33:44] world
[1:33:49] that's all i've ever asked anybody
[1:33:51] show me where i miss this
[1:33:56] show my word
[1:33:57] i've preached wrong out of this bible
[1:34:00] that's all i want people to do
[1:34:06] coming that way i can be helped
[1:34:09] all right go ahead
[1:34:35] know what the truth said
[1:34:57] let's deal with it
[1:35:24] how to take this
[1:35:40] we are
[1:35:54] ain't nothing but the devil
[1:35:56] whose shots have done everything they
[1:35:58] can
[1:36:00] it's a demon
[1:36:03] i faced it
[1:36:07] i rebuke you disagree
[1:36:12] they want to take it out i don't care
[1:36:14] but what does that matter
[1:36:20] is
[1:36:36] god
[1:37:02] i'll come forward
[1:37:08] because this is not our battle
[1:37:11] this is god's battle
[1:37:14] but it's our bible to stay with his word
[1:37:16] to prove to save it we won't believe his
[1:37:19] this
[1:37:37] yes
[1:38:07] is
[1:38:22] anybody else
[1:38:42] discipleship
[1:38:44] when jesus said why don't you go to town
[1:38:49] say where can we go
[1:38:54] right
[1:38:56] where can we go
[1:39:01] what can we do
[1:39:06] believing
[1:39:08] that god is going to take care of
[1:39:10] everybody
[1:39:12] you mean that we believe that he would
[1:39:14] hear his child
[1:39:15] right before he would even hear an angel
[1:39:20] unless your prophet said that
[1:39:22] now wouldn't you hear your children
[1:39:23] before you hear the neighbor's kids
[1:39:26] i mean you're out there in the yard and
[1:39:27] hear your kids over here screaming
[1:39:29] bloody murder and neighbors kids over
[1:39:31] screaming bloody mary you won't help the
[1:39:32] neighbor
[1:39:34] no i'll go help yours and then go after
[1:39:36] the neighborhood
[1:39:38] that's right
[1:39:40] you've been in a store you mothers
[1:39:42] especially
[1:39:45] and there's 49 kids in the store hauling
[1:39:48] mama
[1:39:50] and you're four some yeah
[1:40:00] you mean god won't hear us that's right
[1:40:03] no but he loves to try
[1:40:06] he loves to prove
[1:40:09] it
[1:40:10] i've always believed that what right
[1:40:11] around said he said that he didn't want
[1:40:14] to get down
[1:40:15] to the red sea
[1:40:17] with moses and find out that he had the
[1:40:20] wrong fellow now that's paraphrasing but
[1:40:23] that's what brother ryan said about it
[1:40:24] so he didn't want to get down there and
[1:40:26] find out he had the wrong person now who
[1:40:28] is he talking about to try to find out
[1:40:30] or get to really know who the right
[1:40:31] person is was it god or did he want
[1:40:34] moses to find out
[1:40:37] who he was
[1:40:40] we are his offspring
[1:40:44] we are his children
[1:40:45] one more before we go over there let's
[1:40:47] just sing his course he brought me out
[1:40:52] he brought me
[1:41:16] he set
[1:41:31] make sure you let us know
