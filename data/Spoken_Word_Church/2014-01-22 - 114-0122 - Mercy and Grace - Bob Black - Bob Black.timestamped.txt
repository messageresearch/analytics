[3:39] Jesus where I'm lacking Lord and I pray
[3:42] God that you will put your words in my
[3:44] mouth and close my mouth to my own
[3:45] opinions and my own ideas and thoughts
[3:47] Lord Jesus that you might come upon the
[3:49] scene and have preeminence this night
[3:51] Lord we ask in the name of the Lord
[3:53] Jesus
[3:54] Christ 2 John verse one the Elder unto
[3:59] the elect lady and her
[4:01] children now you know I I've heard so
[4:04] many people you know talk about how they
[4:07] scared and stuff to talk to the elect
[4:09] lady and I was reading the other night
[4:11] that that brother randam said that he
[4:13] counted a privilege to talk to the elect
[4:15] lady and uh and and her children and uh
[4:19] you know I I really I I count it just a
[4:21] real privilege and uh my wife uh she
[4:25] walked I just tell this real she walked
[4:27] by the uh uh the room while I was
[4:29] studying
[4:30] and you know she's not to make boast of
[4:33] myself but I I I try to study a lot
[4:35] because the Bible says redeem the time
[4:38] right and as we come come together I
[4:40] don't want to uh I don't want to waste
[4:43] the time you I know many of you have
[4:44] come from far and and wide and and
[4:47] traveled and and I uh I want to make it
[4:50] worth your while and I pray you that it
[4:52] will be and you know my wife said I'm
[4:54] glad I don't have to preach cuz you know
[4:57] you get in there and and uh
[5:00] and uh you want to do what's
[5:03] right the Elder unto the elect lady and
[5:06] her children whom I love and the truth
[5:08] and not I only but also all they that
[5:11] have known the truth cuz if You' known
[5:13] the truth you can't help but love one
[5:15] another you can't help but love God's
[5:17] children for the truth sake which
[5:19] dwelleth in us and shall be with us
[5:23] forever Grace be with you now this is
[5:25] the this is the my little topic this is
[5:28] a greeting that that a lot of the New
[5:30] Testament Saints used Paul and Peter and
[5:33] they they would when they would greet
[5:34] each other they would greet each other
[5:35] in this little expression Grace be with
[5:38] you mercy and peace from God the father
[5:44] and from the Lord Jesus Christ the son
[5:46] of the father in Truth and Love and now
[5:49] I want to turn over to Mark 16 and just
[5:52] kind of keep that in your in your uh in
[5:55] your pocket
[6:04] mark
[6:09] 16:15 my pages are a little bit stuck
[6:12] here and he said unto them go ye into
[6:16] all the world and preach the gospel to
[6:20] Every Creature you may be seated the
[6:22] Lord out his Blessing to the reading of
[6:24] the
[6:24] word cuz every time you open up the word
[6:28] you're going to be blessed uh even if
[6:30] you don't understand it you know it just
[6:32] keeps adding and adding and and a little
[6:35] bit here and a little bit there and you
[6:38] know I I was
[6:39] coming this was the first time that I
[6:41] ever preached at night uh usually you
[6:44] know it's it's always been in the
[6:46] morning and I I got to think you know
[6:49] little things like that you start
[6:50] thinking about different things and I
[6:51] started thinking on the it shall be
[6:53] light about the evening time and as the
[6:55] sun goes down you know we've all uh many
[6:58] of us today have have at work and you've
[7:00] been out there in the in the world and
[7:03] it looks real dark and Bleak and uh the
[7:06] as as the the world progresses things
[7:11] get darker and darker remember that uh
[7:13] the when the when the Lord painted on
[7:16] the back of the Tabernacle the the seven
[7:18] stages and it just got darker and darker
[7:20] until it looks like there's almost no
[7:22] light left but we've got a promise that
[7:25] it shall be light about the evening time
[7:27] when it when it looks the darkest then
[7:29] then as brother BR said the sun peeps
[7:32] out the rising of the sun it peeps out
[7:34] and and I believe he's manifesting
[7:36] himself today in the flesh of his
[7:38] children that El that elect lady his his
[7:41] manifest you know I was looking up at uh
[7:43] you can look up the last few nights the
[7:45] the moon has been real bright and I got
[7:48] I got to thinking about the moon landing
[7:50] and uh maybe my mind goes in strange
[7:53] places but I was thinking about how that
[7:55] uh when the when they when they first
[7:58] landed on the moon
[8:00] uh they the the first words they said uh
[8:02] Neil Armstrong had he he had meditated
[8:04] and he said I'm going to come up with
[8:06] something just that so memorable and he'
[8:09] me meditated and and thought about what
[8:11] he was going to say uh one small step
[8:14] for a man one giant leap for mankind and
[8:17] he and he messed it up he said one small
[8:19] step for man one giant leap for mankind
[8:22] and he said when he when he took that
[8:24] first step he he was thinking should I
[8:26] should I keep should I keep going cuz he
[8:28] said one small except for man and he he
[8:31] thought should I should I stop and
[8:33] correct it cuz the whole world was
[8:35] listening to what he had to say and you
[8:38] know man is is uh can make mistakes but
[8:42] in this in this Bible the word has been
[8:45] put together so perfectly that there's
[8:47] not one jot or one tit out of place and
[8:50] everything must be fulfilled and I can
[8:52] put all of my rest and all of my hopes
[8:54] and dreams everything that I have all of
[8:57] my hopes are bottled up are are are put
[8:59] on on this I've hung my soul on what on
[9:02] the gospel and and you can hang your
[9:05] your soul on God's word but you can't
[9:07] hang your soul on you know as much as I
[9:09] premeditate as much as I think that I
[9:11] might make a mistake but God's word will
[9:13] never
[9:14] fail and it it so blessed me I was uh I
[9:19] heard this this Minister testifying
[9:21] about it it just really blessed me about
[9:24] how he um and now I'm I'm I'm so far off
[9:27] my notes but uh he he was talking about
[9:30] um that that he faced a a trial and I
[9:35] won't say his name but because it
[9:36] doesn't really matter but he when he was
[9:38] younger he faced a real trial that he
[9:40] went to this one church and they
[9:41] prophesied that he was going to marry
[9:43] this girl and and then he went to
[9:45] another church and he prophesied that he
[9:46] was going to marry this this other the
[9:48] same girl that not knowing anything
[9:50] about the prophecy and it turned out
[9:53] that that that girl was he was he wanted
[9:56] to be a minister and he felt called but
[9:58] that girl was in sin and you know what
[10:01] the Bible says you know we've been
[10:03] through that so now now you come to a
[10:06] Crossroads what are you going to do are
[10:08] you going to take what what the the
[10:11] prophecy that's going forth that appears
[10:13] to be from the Lord two people that
[10:15] don't in two different churches that
[10:16] don't know each other don't know what's
[10:19] going on and he was presented with a
[10:21] Crossroads in his life which way to take
[10:25] the God's word or what appeared to be
[10:29] the right thing to do a
[10:31] sensation a prophecy that that seemed
[10:34] right the way that there is a way that
[10:37] seem is right but uh uh you know there's
[10:41] it's it's fraught with danger and error
[10:43] and uh just a paraphrase now now I I
[10:46] wanted I wanted to speak this morning
[10:49] because I I was talking to uh someone
[10:53] recently that had uh had not come to
[10:57] church in a long time
[10:59] and you know when people people begin to
[11:02] build up things in their mind about you
[11:04] know everybody hates me and things and
[11:06] and uh and and God's mercy has run out
[11:10] and so I wanted to take for a little a
[11:12] little topic this this tonight just a a
[11:15] small maybe just a real simple thing you
[11:17] know a lot of times you you start
[11:19] studying on something that seems simple
[11:21] and it becomes greater and greater until
[11:25] uh you know it just adds on and adds on
[11:28] right but um
[11:29] I want to I want to take for the little
[11:31] topic tonight Grace be with you mercy
[11:34] and peace from God the father and how
[11:37] does that come that we would have grace
[11:40] and mercy Grace and and and mercy how
[11:43] does that delivered and uh you know I I
[11:48] remember um I I was reading about this
[11:52] uh this old black preacher that in the
[11:55] um right about the time of World War I
[11:58] it's a real odd strange story and he uh
[12:02] the The Story Goes that that they they
[12:05] uh you know they were a lot of people in
[12:07] that Community were worried about uh
[12:10] people rising up and and doing you know
[12:12] worri about communism that communism was
[12:14] bad back you know they were the the fear
[12:16] of it was bad and uh so they they rode
[12:19] by his church and they heard this
[12:21] brother preaching he's preaching his
[12:22] heart out they put on the whole armor of
[12:25] God and you've got to fight for you
[12:27] every every ground that you stand on and
[12:30] and fight for what you believe in and
[12:33] and uh they heard that and they they
[12:36] they tried to they put trumped up
[12:38] charges on him that he was trying to
[12:41] start a little Mil militia and uh and
[12:44] and and fight all of the the people in
[12:46] that community and as odd as that and
[12:49] strange as that sounds they they
[12:51] actually wound up taking him and putting
[12:53] him on a stump and had a noose around
[12:55] his neck and they said uh one of one of
[12:58] them rose up and said before before we
[12:59] hang him let's give him a chance to
[13:02] talk
[13:03] now so you know he's up on that stunt
[13:06] with a noose around his neck and what
[13:09] what can he do to say to defend himself
[13:11] can he talk about how what a great
[13:13] person he is what uh what all the things
[13:16] that he had done in his life but instead
[13:19] of what of that he he lifted up his his
[13:22] you know he just he began to speak about
[13:24] something higher and something nobler
[13:26] than his own self and he began to talk
[13:28] about the cause that he had he believed
[13:30] that he was involved with since he he
[13:33] was called to do since he was a young
[13:35] child and and he began to talk about the
[13:38] work that God was doing in his life and
[13:40] the the things that they were doing how
[13:41] they were educating these little young
[13:43] children and all the things that were
[13:45] going on in that church and by the time
[13:47] that he was done they took the Noose off
[13:49] of his neck and they were wanting to
[13:51] pledge their money and their time to his
[13:52] cause because he hadn't lift he wasn't
[13:55] telling about his own self his own life
[13:57] but he was lifting up something higher
[13:59] and something nobler and I believe
[14:01] that's really the gospel the gospel
[14:03] message of mercy and and Grace is not
[14:07] something that that uh you I was
[14:09] thinking of uh sorry I'm jumping around
[14:12] a little bit but I I was thinking of
[14:13] reading uh when I read John Bun's
[14:17] Pilgrim's Progress he told about the the
[14:20] Walk of of Christian the the the little
[14:22] man was named Christian and as he
[14:25] started his journey Moses got on his
[14:27] back and began to beat him and and
[14:30] sometimes that seems how some I don't
[14:33] want to talk about ministers but
[14:34] sometimes it seems like that's how some
[14:36] ministers try to do is is beat you to
[14:38] the gospel beat you with a law beat you
[14:40] with you must do this but a real uh I
[14:43] believe a real God call Min will pull
[14:46] you toward the truth through three pulls
[14:50] will pull you toward the truth of the
[14:52] the real gospel message drawing you like
[14:54] brother brandham Drew people through
[14:56] three pools drawing you toward the truth
[14:58] and it pulls you to a want a desire to
[15:00] serve God a desire to serve him more and
[15:04] mercy pulls you Mercy leads to Grace
[15:09] which leads to peace Mercy is uh many
[15:12] times we confuse the two what what is
[15:14] mer what's the difference between mercy
[15:15] and Grace and they're they're I've heard
[15:18] it said that they're like sisters that
[15:19] they they almost you almost can't find
[15:22] one without the other that Mercy is the
[15:24] removal of what you deserve and Grace is
[15:26] giving a blessing and it's it's very
[15:29] very strange how uh how it's uh as as I
[15:34] as I was growing up how you know I would
[15:36] hear the gospel preached I don't believe
[15:41] that you can really preach the true
[15:43] gospel without Mercy but some so often
[15:45] it's it's Mercy is removed from the
[15:48] equation Mercy is taken out and how how
[15:52] give me some examples brother Bob now
[15:54] now brother Brown gave the the great
[15:56] example that we look at of well the days
[15:58] of Miracles are passed so you go to the
[16:01] doctor and the doctor says you got
[16:03] cancer well there's and there's nothing
[16:06] we can do and you go to your preacher
[16:08] and the preacher says well I'm sorry the
[16:11] days of Miracles are passed and he
[16:13] removes Mercy from the equation he takes
[16:16] Mercy out there's how where's the mercy
[16:18] at but there is Mercy and mercy David
[16:22] said the uh well all through the Old
[16:25] Testament if you run in in the table
[16:27] software right typ his mer mercy
[16:29] endureth forever you get uh just an
[16:32] endless number of quotes on and
[16:35] on but we you can't remove Mercy from
[16:40] the equation because Mercy is part of
[16:43] the Gospel now they say days of the days
[16:46] of Miracles are passed and I I maybe you
[16:50] know even if you hav't a preacher say
[16:53] that I think maybe sometimes we get in
[16:55] our our minds that the days of Miracles
[16:57] aren't passed but maybe God it's not
[17:01] God's will for me to be heal and I think
[17:04] that uh if if we can get ever get the
[17:08] Revelation that the days of Miracles for
[17:10] us are not passed you know they all all
[17:13] those people around the pool of Bethesda
[17:16] were waiting for something but if they
[17:18] could have called on to the Revelation
[17:20] that God is the same yesterday today and
[17:22] forever he's not just merciful in the
[17:24] New Testament but he was merciful
[17:26] throughout all the law all the old
[17:29] Testament and the New Testament he's
[17:30] always been a a a God that's ready to
[17:33] heal and ready to save and ready to meet
[17:35] our needs if we'll just come to him and
[17:39] now now I was looking at you know how
[17:42] how different people preach mercy and
[17:45] one of the reasons that one of the ways
[17:47] that Mercy is removed from the equation
[17:49] is is by putting a date on the
[17:53] requirement of your salvation and you
[17:55] know uh well I'll just you know brother
[17:59] Brown didn't like to say denominational
[18:01] names but we all know this this
[18:02] denomination had their initials are
[18:04] Jehovah's Witness and uh but they
[18:08] started a doctrine that that there was
[18:10] no mercy you could not go to heaven
[18:12] after
[18:13] 1881 and now it it's almost like that
[18:16] that leaped over into the message and
[18:19] and we started putting date criteria to
[18:22] to the you know you can't you can't get
[18:25] you can't go in the Rapture you can't
[18:26] get saved different things after 1963 or
[18:30] after 1977 but I believe that uh let's
[18:34] let's read this
[18:36] quote uh brother Joe pull up that I
[18:39] think it's number one questions and
[18:40] answers number
[18:42] three uh where somebody said in
[18:46] 1964 there we go brother random some say
[18:49] Mercy is over and no one can be saved
[18:51] now is this true I'm glad I got this one
[18:54] he said we watch and pray we watch the
[18:56] prayer lines and it seems some are still
[18:58] finding Mercy now that's the first
[18:59] question you got too is Mercy over and
[19:02] don't never think that see just keep
[19:05] right on doing everything you can until
[19:07] you're taken away see we notice in the
[19:10] prayer line some finds Mercy sure
[19:12] Mercy's doors are open see I think where
[19:14] you got this this thought might lay
[19:16] between see I don't have time to get
[19:18] each of the any of these scriptures the
[19:20] right place you see each one of these
[19:21] things the right place they in the
[19:23] prayer line you find Mercy certainly if
[19:25] I know Jesus was coming this afternoon
[19:27] I'd be doing just the thing I'm doing
[19:29] right now see just continuing right on
[19:33] Mercy is always open see and now where I
[19:36] think you get it is about the finishing
[19:38] of the seven Church ages and the Seven
[19:39] Seals being loose see the Seven Seals
[19:41] that's manifested what takes place as
[19:43] what has took place the seventh Church
[19:45] Age and and he goes on I won't read all
[19:47] that but but Mercy is still going on but
[19:50] why is it still going on now that's a
[19:52] question why is Mercy still available
[19:55] why can you still come because the is
[19:59] still here and the bride the the blood
[20:02] is the bumper blood is still covering
[20:03] the Earth because the bride is holding
[20:05] that at Bay and I believe that God uses
[20:08] the bride uses our hands and uses our
[20:11] eyes and uses our feet to deliver his
[20:13] mercy and his
[20:15] grace but you know a lot of times it's
[20:17] just not accepted it's not it's not
[20:20] received but let me go let me finish
[20:23] going through a few of these other ways
[20:24] that Mercy is is removed from the
[20:26] equation Mercy you people will take
[20:30] Mercy take your salvation away because
[20:33] of who your lineage is now I I'm not
[20:36] going to get into that too much but you
[20:38] know now you know they're attacking
[20:39] brother brandom's lineage I I I was
[20:41] shocked to see that the people are
[20:43] putting uh together uh genealogical
[20:46] trees or whatever try to poke a hole in
[20:48] his lineage but now aren't you so glad
[20:51] that you don't you can't put your faith
[20:54] in your own lineage I I if I went back
[20:57] in my own lineage I'd find oh who knows
[20:59] what and you know I was reading that
[21:01] even if you go back 10 Generations that
[21:03] that you'll find that somewhere along
[21:04] the line you and your wife both have the
[21:07] same grandfather because that's how
[21:09] that's how much it's stretched out you
[21:11] know that 10 Generations doesn't seem
[21:13] very far but if you there's like a 99%
[21:16] chance that both of you would have the
[21:18] same grandfather so you'll have you'll
[21:20] run into some problems some some things
[21:22] that might be worrisome if you search
[21:24] your lineage on back but if you're in
[21:27] the genes of God then that's what that's
[21:29] what my hope and my rest is that I'm I'm
[21:31] in him I'm I'm predestinated in him not
[21:35] in anything of my my own work my own
[21:37] flesh but um now now what what so what
[21:42] we do is is is you I remember uh that
[21:47] story back in numbers where uh you know
[21:50] Moses the children of Israel began to be
[21:53] bitten by fiery serpents fiery serpents
[21:56] bit them and and you know you could look
[21:57] at that in lots of different ways false
[21:59] doctrine that the the same serpent that
[22:01] bit uh Eve in the Garden of Eden that
[22:04] and and so forth and it begin to bite
[22:07] the children of Israel and so Mo God
[22:09] told Moses what to do he he ran out and
[22:11] sent Aaron among them to lift up a
[22:13] Brazen Serpent and uh the other day I
[22:16] was showing uh my kids we we rolled by a
[22:19] little hospital or whatever and that
[22:21] that Brazen serpent is still on the wall
[22:23] out there because of what that
[22:24] represents and they're advertising the
[22:27] gospel the Great of God and don't even
[22:29] realizing it a testimony that of God's
[22:33] grace and you know then I wonder and
[22:37] this is what I believe because just of
[22:39] human nature the stubbornness of people
[22:41] that as Aaron ran among the people with
[22:44] that Brazen serpent that there were
[22:45] people there that were in the stubborn
[22:47] in stubborn in their heart and refused
[22:49] to look upon that because uh you know
[22:52] even today is the gospel is Mercy is
[22:54] being preached and Grace is being
[22:56] preached from the h the pulpit people
[22:58] will look upon it stubbornly and say
[23:00] well I don't like that brother I don't
[23:02] like the way he presents it he presents
[23:04] it too harshly he presents it in a way
[23:06] that hurts my feelings and maybe Moses
[23:09] had done something that uh in their eyes
[23:12] was a little bit hurtful was a little
[23:14] bit they they thought he shouldn't do
[23:16] you know think about all the times that
[23:17] they they confronted him with with with
[23:20] things you shouldn't have done it this
[23:21] way but God was behind Moses God was
[23:25] behind the scenes and he Vindicated him
[23:27] he is when he cut when he pulled the
[23:29] veil off of his face his face Shone with
[23:31] the glory of God and God was in their
[23:33] midst and many I I I I believe when that
[23:36] braz serpent went among them that many
[23:38] of them there that they failed to
[23:40] realize that God was being merciful to
[23:42] them they failed to realize that God was
[23:45] issuing an invitation pulling them
[23:47] drawing them and all they had to do was
[23:49] look upon it and you remember that same
[23:52] scene played out when Jesus was on the
[23:54] cross that there was one on one side
[23:56] that said Lord remember me and there was
[23:59] another on the other side that laughed
[24:00] and mocked he all he had to do was just
[24:04] say Lord remember me he was right there
[24:06] in the presence of God right there in
[24:08] the presence of the almighty and he
[24:10] failed to recognize that mercy and grace
[24:13] are being offered Lord I I I wonder how
[24:16] many of us how many of us are maybe
[24:18] sitting and and and fail to recognize
[24:21] what God has done for us in this day
[24:23] that we come to church and come in an
[24:25] atmosphere but don't we fail to real iiz
[24:28] the mercy and the grace that God has
[24:30] given us that he's offering it just like
[24:32] he did that Brazen
[24:34] serpent all you have to do is look upon
[24:36] it and see what God has done amen and so
[24:43] so many times we'll remove Mercy from
[24:45] the equation but we'll give out Grace
[24:48] too freely now that's an interesting
[24:51] thing because you know and this might
[24:54] stumble I I I I told somebody this
[24:56] recently and it just I think blew their
[24:58] mind that Grace is not for everybody
[25:02] because first you have to accept mercy
[25:05] and uh you know I saw a copy of that
[25:08] little writing that uh that Abraham
[25:10] Lincoln said this prisoner is pardoned
[25:12] and he signed his name Abraham Lincoln
[25:15] and that little that pardon that Mercy
[25:17] that he had given was not accepted it
[25:20] was it was uh he he said I don't I don't
[25:22] believe it I don't believe that it's
[25:24] real I don't believe that it's true and
[25:28] so he didn't get grace and grace you
[25:32] know now think Grace wrapped up in Grace
[25:36] the grace of the gift of the Holy Ghost
[25:39] that after you receive his Mercy he
[25:41] gives you the gift of the Holy Ghost and
[25:43] then Grace just keeps on magnifying
[25:46] marriage and divorce the grace of
[25:48] marriage and divorce is not for those
[25:50] outside it's for a special elect group
[25:53] of people that have received God's mercy
[25:56] and the gift of the Holy Ghost is not
[25:58] for just any it was not for Cain because
[26:01] he did not receive it he did not even
[26:04] though God extended his hand and I I
[26:07] believe that that he said if you'll come
[26:09] and do like your brother even though he
[26:11] didn't you know have we say Abel had a
[26:14] revelation well God came down and spoke
[26:16] to Cain and said come on let's bring
[26:18] your offering bring it down and he
[26:21] extended his hand of mercy and Cain
[26:24] wouldn't accept it so he didn't get
[26:26] Grace Grace was not given to him Grace
[26:30] is only given to a special people that
[26:32] can accept God's mercy and you know
[26:35] think about the three pools of brother
[26:37] rand's Ministry how it's a mercy was
[26:40] shown in healing and mercy was shown by
[26:44] the gift of discernment to purify the
[26:47] purify the hearts of the Believers and
[26:49] as they begin to fail off fall off they
[26:51] fail to continue on to get Grace the
[26:55] opening of the word the uh spoken word
[26:58] the the uh and so forth and now now when
[27:03] God when a people begin to hunger for
[27:06] God's mercy for God's grace to be made
[27:09] manifest to them what does God
[27:13] do he send somebody as a represent
[27:17] representative of himself to administer
[27:20] that his Mercy to administered his grace
[27:23] glory to give it to give it out and you
[27:26] know I was I was thinking about when uh
[27:29] you know brother brand talked about uh
[27:31] before he began his ministry and he
[27:34] didn't he he didn't say exactly like
[27:36] I'll say it but they began to publish in
[27:38] the in the Pentecostal Publications and
[27:40] things that that uh send us pray for
[27:44] Elijah to come and the people began to
[27:46] look for that and pray and hunger and
[27:49] then Elijah came on the scene now if you
[27:52] pray and hunger in your heart for God to
[27:54] send you somebody to show you the word
[27:57] to open it to you then I believe that
[27:59] God will match your desire and he'll
[28:02] give you somebody
[28:06] and that's that's the truth now now so
[28:11] when the people are trying to line up
[28:13] with the word if you're trying to line
[28:15] up the word with the word then God will
[28:18] meet your desire by sending you a
[28:20] messenger amen
[28:23] now in Luke uh I'll just read this you
[28:26] don't have to pull it up or or turn to
[28:28] to it but now remember Zachariah John's
[28:32] father when he saw the angel he didn't
[28:34] believe him so his his uh he died a
[28:37] little bit so his tongue was sealed his
[28:39] tongue was and and then when John was
[28:41] born his tongue was loosed right and oh
[28:44] my was it loo and he began to Proclaim
[28:46] what kind of child this would be now the
[28:50] people they were hungering and thirsting
[28:52] for the word and I I want you to read uh
[28:56] just listen as I read the kind of child
[28:58] that God sent them to prepare the way
[29:01] for the one that that uh was going to
[29:04] come and and you know let's just listen
[29:06] verse Luke 1:
[29:09] 77-79 and he's talking about he's going
[29:11] to he's going to prepare the way of the
[29:13] Lord to give knowledge of Salvation unto
[29:17] his people by the remission of their
[29:20] sins now think think about now what
[29:23] mercy and Grace is Glory that somebody's
[29:25] going to stand before you behind a
[29:28] Pulpit to give you Mercy that's what I'm
[29:30] talking about to give knowledge of
[29:33] Salvation unto his people by the
[29:35] remission of their
[29:36] sins now as John I'm not quite done
[29:40] reading this but now John as he stood by
[29:42] the river uh Jordan baptizing and and
[29:46] preaching I believe so many failed to
[29:49] see what his purpose was that he was
[29:51] introducing them to Mercy he was showing
[29:54] them Grace preparing the way of the Lord
[29:56] to get them ready for what they had been
[29:59] waiting for for 4,000 years to give
[30:02] knowledge of Salvation unto his people
[30:04] by the remission of their sins through
[30:06] the tender mercy of our God whereby the
[30:09] Dayspring from on high hath visited us
[30:11] y'all know what day spring is Dayspring
[30:14] is the rising of the sun it is the
[30:17] rising of the sun that's
[30:19] right whereby the Dayspring from on high
[30:22] hath visited us to give light to them
[30:25] that sit in darkness and in the shadow
[30:27] of to guide our feet into the way of
[30:30] Peace So now John's come on the scene
[30:34] and Zachariah is prophesying that he's
[30:37] going through the tender mercy of our
[30:40] God to show to bring their to their
[30:42] knowledge of the Salvation unto his
[30:45] people by the remission of their sins
[30:47] and and that's what when when the people
[30:50] are hungering and thirsting for God then
[30:52] God puts somebody there to show them his
[30:55] mercy and so of when the instrument of
[30:58] Mercy is overlooked and misunderstood
[31:01] Noah stood outside of his ark preaching
[31:03] mercy and if they would have come in
[31:05] they would have receive Grace and he
[31:07] stood outside calling and and begging
[31:10] and pleading with people that God was
[31:12] going to judge the Earth and and uh if
[31:15] they would have just come into the ark
[31:17] they would have received the grace of
[31:19] being saved and carried over
[31:22] and think about Joseph who was who was
[31:26] you know he told him a dream that was
[31:28] true that he would be their deliverer he
[31:30] told his brothers that should have
[31:32] believed it but instead of believing it
[31:34] they mocked him and and scorned him and
[31:36] then they ended up you know things got
[31:39] really bad and they had to go on a a
[31:42] journey to um to to receive uh what God
[31:46] had in store for them but they they they
[31:48] didn't understand what God was doing
[31:51] they did they failed to recognize that
[31:53] God was working in their midst and we
[31:56] talked about Moses and David David now
[32:00] one of my favorite stories is how David
[32:02] you know when when Samuel came to to
[32:05] anoint David his he he he first stopped
[32:08] at his older brother eliab e l i a b if
[32:12] I pronounce that wrong y'all forgive me
[32:14] but now so he passed him by because he
[32:17] was he wasn't he wasn't the one that God
[32:20] had chosen but remember when David went
[32:22] to uh to battle Goliath and and there
[32:25] was a Liah waiting on him and he and
[32:28] David ran up with all the the provisions
[32:30] the food and the food and things and and
[32:33] uh a li was there to mock him and say
[32:35] what are what are you doing here and I
[32:37] forget the exact words he used but he
[32:39] failed to recognize that God's anointed
[32:41] was standing right there and that would
[32:44] take care of the battle would take care
[32:45] of the things and and you know David was
[32:49] a little
[32:50] Shepherd and I was thinking too about
[32:52] how you know how this all ties together
[32:54] with the first people
[32:56] that David was concerned about his flock
[33:00] and the first people that heard about
[33:02] the good news were little Shepherds out
[33:03] in the field and brother Brown talked
[33:05] about why did they have to be Shepherds
[33:07] the lowly and the meek but you know I
[33:10] believe that God has you know brother uh
[33:12] Ronald Reagan used to talk about a
[33:14] trickle down economy how how how the
[33:16] economy would trickle down and whatnot
[33:19] and I believe God kind of has a trickle
[33:21] down economy and it works kind of like
[33:23] this uh when when John in Revelations he
[33:26] saw uh one of the the four beasts would
[33:29] come and say come and see and John would
[33:32] go look and he would see and then he was
[33:35] able to speak it and then it just keeps
[33:37] trickling down brother brandom was able
[33:39] to go and see and he got the Revelation
[33:42] and he was able to go and speak it and
[33:44] then brother Dale let's say it like that
[33:46] he got the Revelation is able to speak
[33:48] it and I'm sitting out there and I get
[33:50] the Revelation and now I'm able to go
[33:51] speak it and it keeps trickling down the
[33:53] little housewife gets the Revelation and
[33:55] she can speak it to her kids and on down
[33:58] on down because God reveals himself that
[34:01] way God puts somebody maybe the the
[34:05] messenger of mercy and Grace to your
[34:08] little children is is your little Mam
[34:11] and and uh in the home cooking and
[34:13] whatnot talking about God in the kitchen
[34:16] because you've received something
[34:17] through God's trickle down economy
[34:20] through God speaking his word down from
[34:22] from from the four beasts all the way
[34:25] down through the through his economy
[34:27] that way that's
[34:30] and oh where am
[34:33] I
[34:35] now now the one I I want to I want to
[34:38] talk
[34:39] about was uh God's God's mercy now you
[34:43] remember that little story of the the uh
[34:46] brother R like to talk about the story
[34:48] of Elisha and the shunamite woman how
[34:52] she she was she was paying attention and
[34:56] Along Came Elija and she said I perceive
[34:59] that that's a man of God she saw the
[35:02] things that were happening she saw the
[35:04] things that were taking place and she
[35:06] knew that something was special about
[35:08] that and you know the first time maybe
[35:12] when you first heard about this message
[35:14] it was in a a strange way I I knew um I
[35:19] knew some older brothers and sisters
[35:20] that when they first heard about the
[35:22] message it was through a brother that
[35:23] told him that you have an evil spirit on
[35:25] you now how many of us could take that
[35:27] and they and they uh they they they they
[35:31] said well there's there's something to
[35:33] this and they caught hold to it and went
[35:34] and followed after it and you know that
[35:36] maybe this little this little uh
[35:39] shunamite woman from someplace that
[35:42] maybe wasn't on the map hardly but she
[35:46] she caught something that God was doing
[35:49] now now let's fast forward to when that
[35:52] remember when that pre that plane was
[35:54] delayed yeah and brother brandham was
[35:56] walking along and he didn't know where
[35:58] he was going he was follow following the
[36:00] leading of the spirit and he was on a
[36:03] Mission of Mercy a mission of Grace
[36:07] because that little woman now the the
[36:10] little the little washer woman had done
[36:13] something that you can do today and that
[36:16] is identify yourself with what is shown
[36:18] in the scripture and she found somebody
[36:21] in the scripture that she could identify
[36:23] with and she said remember she told
[36:24] Brother random I am like that shunamite
[36:27] woman
[36:28] right but now God God has shown me who I
[36:33] am but now where is Elijah where is
[36:36] Elisha and she was looking looking for
[36:39] the one that was recorded in the Bible
[36:41] because she had so closely identified
[36:43] herself now you can identify yourself in
[36:46] scripture when you can see yourself in
[36:49] the scripture then it becomes not just
[36:52] letters on the page but it comes
[36:54] something living inside of you that you
[36:56] know uh you know she knew that God was
[36:59] the same yesterday today and forever and
[37:01] he would have to meet her need because
[37:03] now remember if you have something a
[37:06] need in your life and you're hungering
[37:08] and thirsting to line up with God God's
[37:09] word God will send you somebody to help
[37:13] you do it to show you how to do it sir
[37:15] and she was hungry and thirsty she had
[37:19] God had given her a child just like that
[37:21] woman in the Bible and she was hungering
[37:23] and thirsting and crying out to God for
[37:25] God to send her an Elijah and he came
[37:27] upon the seen and and raised her child
[37:30] up and uh you know years later he ran
[37:32] into him in in I think it was a bus stop
[37:35] or something because she identified
[37:38] herself with the scripture and she got
[37:41] Mercy because Mercy raised her child up
[37:45] and and and mercy and Grace right paid a
[37:49] visit to her house on that day yeah now
[37:53] I I kind of wanted to you know when I
[37:55] first started we read in second
[37:58] joh uh Grace be with you mercy and peace
[38:02] from God the
[38:11] father and I want to tie that
[38:14] together with Mark
[38:16] 16:15 which says and he said unto them
[38:19] go ye into all the world and preach the
[38:22] gospel to Every Creature yes because
[38:24] that's kind of what I'm leading up to
[38:26] this is how God manifest his Mercy amen
[38:30] or one way you know he he uh he can pay
[38:34] you a visit when you're on your knees
[38:36] but you know you've got to hear about
[38:38] the gospel you got to hear about his
[38:40] Mercy whether it's from reading what
[38:42] John wrote or listening to what brother
[38:44] brandham said because uh well we've all
[38:47] been hearing it the last few weeks that
[38:49] the seed comes through the body you've
[38:51] got to hear uh like philli speaking to
[38:54] the Ethiopian unit let me explain this
[38:56] to you and Philip brought Mercy to the
[38:58] Ethiopian
[39:00] unit and so the the last commission the
[39:04] great Great Commission right just before
[39:06] Jesus went up to the father he said and
[39:09] he said unto them go ye into all the
[39:11] world and preach the gospel to Every
[39:13] Creature now he didn't say just go to
[39:16] the good people but he said go into all
[39:18] the world he didn't say just go to one
[39:20] of the three kinds of Believers but to
[39:22] go to all all three kinds the
[39:25] unbelievers the make believers the real
[39:28] Believers every one of them right and
[39:32] preach the gospel and you know what not
[39:35] just to the Believers but to Every
[39:37] Creature Amen to Every Creature because
[39:40] uh and you know in Paul in Colossians
[39:42] 1:23 he said if you continue in the
[39:44] faith grounded and settled and be not
[39:46] moved away from the hope of the Gospel
[39:47] which you have heard and which was
[39:49] preached to every creature which is
[39:51] under heaven where of I Paul and made a
[39:53] minister I believe he was confessing
[39:55] making his confession that I have
[39:56] preached it to every everywhere I've
[39:58] gone I've preached it to every creature
[40:01] and you know brother Brandon preached it
[40:03] to Every Creature he calls a little
[40:04] fishy that's he he preached the gospel
[40:06] to a little fishy and that little fishy
[40:08] came back to life he preached the gospel
[40:10] to the to the storm and the storm ceased
[40:13] he preached the gospel to uh uh had
[40:16] right's two boys and they gave their
[40:18] life to the Lord and He preached the
[40:22] gospel to that tomor and his wife and it
[40:24] fell away because the there's power
[40:27] there's mercy and Grace in the in the
[40:29] gospel and in the in the gospel first
[40:32] Mercy has has to be preached so that you
[40:35] can accept it and I believe that's the
[40:37] way the Bible is laid out because first
[40:39] you can look at the Old Testament and
[40:41] see that uh you know there's how can I
[40:43] keep the law there's no way to uh keep
[40:46] the law and then in the New Testament
[40:48] Jesus magnifies the law if you even look
[40:50] upon a woman with lust in your heart you
[40:52] committed adultery already in your heart
[40:54] how how can you keep all of these
[40:56] Commandments can you keep this but what
[40:59] it does is it convicts you of sin it
[41:00] causes you to realize that there's
[41:02] iniquity in your life and then you can
[41:04] accept the grace of God and you know
[41:07] sometimes I wonder if
[41:09] maybe you know I I know this is kind of
[41:12] a simple little
[41:13] topic but I I wonder sometimes if
[41:17] uh you know we we can explain the Deep
[41:20] things but can we explain you need to be
[41:23] saved you need you need Mercy you need
[41:26] you need Grace and you know Paul Paul
[41:29] said it like this in Romans 1:16 for I
[41:31] am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ
[41:35] for it is the power of God into
[41:37] salvation to everyone that believeth to
[41:39] the Jew first and also the Greek the
[41:42] gospel is not just letters on a page dos
[41:44] and don'ts but it is the power of God
[41:47] and he said I am not ashamed of the
[41:49] Gospel I'm not ashamed to tell it like
[41:51] it is to tell you and I was talking to
[41:54] somebody recently and they uh the the
[41:56] person that hadn't been in church in
[41:58] many many years and they were saying but
[42:01] I I love God and I I told them you know
[42:04] the Bible says if you love me you'll
[42:07] obey my Commandments because that is the
[42:10] real love of God is to do his
[42:12] Commandments and you know many times
[42:14] when you tell people the truth they turn
[42:17] and and get upset with you but Paul was
[42:19] not ashamed to tell the truth he was not
[42:21] ashamed to tell it like it was and when
[42:24] somebody tells it like it is don't look
[42:27] like uh they did at the brass Serpent
[42:29] and say I'm I'm not going to uh you I
[42:33] don't like that brother he's he's
[42:35] telling it too straight he's not he's
[42:38] not uh stroking my fur the right way
[42:43] yeah and uh at Romans 16:26 Paul said
[42:47] but now is made manifest and by the
[42:49] scriptures of the prophets according to
[42:51] the Commandment of the Everlasting God
[42:53] made known to All Nations for The
[42:55] Obedience of faith
[42:57] the gospel was made known to Every
[43:00] Nation everywhere in the power and
[43:03] demonstration of the spirit and that's
[43:05] what that's what living a Christian life
[43:07] is just letting that that the power and
[43:10] demonstration of the spirit radiate from
[43:12] within that's what preaching is is
[43:14] preaching by your own experience letting
[43:16] that own your own third pool experience
[43:19] come out that the the things that God
[43:22] has done for you come out so that other
[43:25] people can partake of the same Mercy
[43:27] mercy and Grace not trying to beat over
[43:29] the head like like in John bu's book
[43:32] like Moses riding the back of Christian
[43:34] beating him but pulling and drawing
[43:37] based on my experience to draw you into
[43:39] the same Fellowship that I believe that
[43:41] I have
[43:43] and so the gospel must be preached to
[43:48] every
[43:49] creature and you know a lot of times it
[43:52] it seems
[43:53] like the gospel is so hard to sell but
[43:57] it shouldn't be it's not like you're
[43:58] selling a used car where you got to
[44:00] convince somebody that the tires aren't
[44:02] falling off or you got to convince
[44:04] somebody that the the the transmission
[44:07] doesn't have problems but it should be
[44:09] when someone hears about the mercy that
[44:12] God has given that he has risen from the
[44:14] dead that he said lo I am with you
[44:16] always that he that believeth and is
[44:19] baptized shall be saved he that
[44:20] believeth not shall be damned these
[44:23] simple truths that it should be it
[44:25] should sell itself and I I believe it
[44:28] does I believe it does to somebody
[44:30] that's hungering and thirsty now just
[44:32] because you put the Brazen serpent up or
[44:35] that Moses did doesn't believe that
[44:37] everyone will look at it that's just a
[44:39] simple fact of fact of life but the
[44:42] gospel the go there's such power in the
[44:44] gospel and the simple truth of the
[44:46] Gospel that it will it it sells itself
[44:50] and you know there's there's the go the
[44:55] power of the Gospel the power of mercy
[44:57] and Grace in a believer's life in Luke
[45:01] 10:17 it gives Power To Tread on
[45:03] serpents and scorpions power over all
[45:05] the power of the enemy power for a
[45:08] relationship with God and transforming
[45:11] power to fulfill his
[45:13] word and
[45:16] I but first you got to come to the
[45:21] realization that you need God's grace
[45:24] that you need his Mercy when you realize
[45:27] that you have iniquity in your life you
[45:29] know Paul uh uh second
[45:33] Thessalonians it's written Paul was
[45:36] talking about the mystery of iniquity do
[45:38] already work such a a mystery of of that
[45:42] there is Iniquity and and and it needs
[45:44] to be removed from your life and that we
[45:48] can see that now being removed by the by
[45:50] the revealing of God's
[45:52] word
[45:54] now you I remember Zechariah chap
[45:57] 3 and when zerubba was going to build
[46:00] the temple and uh Zachariah saw that
[46:03] vision of of Joshua standing there with
[46:05] Satan to his right and accusing him and
[46:07] then Joshua had filthy rags on him
[46:09] filthy his own iniquity that iniquity
[46:12] was taken away and he he was given a new
[46:14] garment mercy and Grace he saw he needed
[46:18] mercy and Grace was given to him that
[46:21] his filthy rags were were uh taken away
[46:24] and I want to
[46:27] maybe Jump
[46:28] Ahead to this little story that I think
[46:32] is so
[46:33] powerful in uh Second
[46:36] Kings chapter
[46:48] 20 let me get another drink of water
[47:03] now maybe this is a story that
[47:06] um I I believe we're a lot of us are
[47:09] familiar
[47:12] with I'm just going to read um from
[47:15] Second Kings if you got a sco fill Bible
[47:17] is Page
[47:19] 447 I'll read from verse one down to
[47:22] about verse
[47:25] 13 just to kind of set the stage in
[47:29] those days was Hezekiah sick unto death
[47:31] and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amos
[47:33] came to him and said unto him thus
[47:34] sayith the Lord set thine house in order
[47:36] for Thou shalt die and not live then he
[47:38] turned his face to the wall and prayed
[47:40] unto the Lord saying I beseech thee Oh
[47:42] Lord remember now how I have walked
[47:44] before thee in truth and with a perfect
[47:46] heart and have done that which is good
[47:48] in thy sight and Hezekiah WEP sore now
[47:53] that's when when you have nothing
[47:54] between you and your savior that's when
[47:56] you can come and confidence and ask God
[47:59] and believe that he is a rewarder of
[48:00] them that diligently seek seek Him
[48:03] believe believe that he will reward
[48:05] you and what a great testimony that
[48:08] Hezekiah had that he had a perfect heart
[48:11] and had done that which is good in God's
[48:13] sight right and Hezekiah whipped sore
[48:15] and it came to pass before Isaiah was
[48:17] going out into the middle court that the
[48:19] word of the Lord came to him saying turn
[48:21] again and tell Hezekiah the captain of
[48:23] my people thus saith the Lord the god of
[48:26] David the father I have heard thy prayer
[48:28] I have seen thy tears behold I will heal
[48:30] thee on the third day Thou shalt go up
[48:32] under the house of the Lord now I know
[48:35] we've all heard this story we've all
[48:37] heard brother Ram tell it but I I think
[48:38] it's so powerful how that
[48:41] that you know many times we need healing
[48:45] and things in our own body but uh I
[48:48] wonder if we maybe have faith like
[48:51] Hezekiah did that even though a prophet
[48:54] had come and told him that he was going
[48:56] to die but he got down on his knees and
[48:59] believed that God would answer his
[49:00] prayer and held up before God his life
[49:03] and said I've done that which has been
[49:05] was perfect I've tried to live a a life
[49:07] holy before you and I will and and and
[49:10] uh God told Isaiah I will add into thy
[49:13] days 15 years and I will deliver thee in
[49:15] this city out of the hand of the king of
[49:16] Assyria and I will defend this city for
[49:18] my own sake and for my servant David's
[49:21] sake and Isaiah said take a lump of figs
[49:23] and and so forth and and so Hezekiah was
[49:27] Hezekiah was given another 15 years to
[49:30] live now what's interesting about it and
[49:32] we know how God God knew God knows the
[49:37] end from the beginning he knows not only
[49:39] what will happen but the possibilities I
[49:41] believe he he knew that if brother
[49:43] brandom had gone up and lived do hermit
[49:45] that that he you know he showed him that
[49:48] trash uh the trash pile that this this
[49:51] is what your life would have been and we
[49:53] know God knows what would have been and
[49:56] believe he knew what would have been if
[49:59] Hezekiah would have kept living that's
[50:01] why it was time for him to go so that he
[50:03] could keep that testimony of a perfect
[50:05] life but he he went and showed all the
[50:07] after after his life was extended he
[50:09] went and showed all the secrets of of
[50:12] God's house to the enemies and they got
[50:14] began to get jealous and and and marred
[50:16] his testimony but now he his life was
[50:19] extended another 15 years but in the
[50:21] third year he had this little boy named
[50:24] man manasse which turned out to be one
[50:26] of the worst Kings in in in all of
[50:28] Israel and manasse lived just uh he he
[50:32] let's read about some of the things that
[50:34] Manasseh did that's uh you know in in uh
[50:38] in the king first and second I can't
[50:40] remember I think it's Second Kings that
[50:42] talks about all the things that he did
[50:44] but I'm going to turn over to 2
[50:45] Chronicles because Second Kings kind of
[50:47] leaves you hanging it doesn't tell all
[50:50] of the details you have to turn over to
[50:52] 2 Chronicles 3C to what God see what God
[50:55] did from
[50:57] Manasseh despite all of the evil that
[51:00] Manasseh had done in his life so I'm
[51:02] going to read from second chronicles 33
[51:06] start at verse one manasse was 12 years
[51:09] old when he began to Reign and he
[51:11] reigned 50 and 5 years in Jerusalem but
[51:13] did that which was evil in the sight of
[51:15] the Lord like unto the Abominations of
[51:17] the Heathen whom the Lord had cast out
[51:19] before the children of Israel for he
[51:22] build again the high places which
[51:24] hezekiah's father had broken down and he
[51:26] reared up altars for balum and made
[51:28] Groves and worshiped all the host of
[51:30] heaven and served them also he built
[51:32] altars in the house of the Lord where of
[51:34] the Lord had said in Jerusalem shall my
[51:35] name be forever and he built altars for
[51:38] all the host of Heaven and the two
[51:40] courts of the house of the Lord and he
[51:42] calls his children to pass through the
[51:43] fire in the Valley of the son of henm
[51:45] also he observed times and used
[51:47] enchantments and used Witchcraft and
[51:50] dealt with a familiar spirit and with
[51:52] Wizards and the list get is getting
[51:55] pretty bad he wrought much evil in the
[51:58] sight of the Lord to provoke him to
[51:59] anger and he set a carved image the idol
[52:02] which he had made in the house of God of
[52:04] which God had said to David and to
[52:05] Solomon his son in this house and in
[52:07] Jerusalem which I have chosen before all
[52:09] the tribes of Israel will I put my name
[52:11] forever neither will I anymore remove
[52:14] the foot of Israel from out of the land
[52:15] which I have appointed for your fathers
[52:17] so that they will take heed to do all
[52:19] that I have commanded them
[52:20] according to the whole law and the
[52:23] statutes and the ordinances by the hand
[52:24] of Moses so manasse made Judah and the
[52:27] inhabitants of Jerusalem to Heir and to
[52:29] do worse than the Heathen whom the Lord
[52:31] had destroyed before the children of
[52:32] Israel now let's stop that right there
[52:34] for a second because many times we look
[52:36] at manasse or we look at one another the
[52:38] same way we're looking at manasse right
[52:40] now that he's Beyond hope there's no way
[52:42] to him to be restored to to fellowship
[52:45] with God and you know uh there there
[52:49] comes a time that when you can exhaust
[52:52] all Mercy when God calls you and calls
[52:54] you and calls you and hardens your heart
[52:56] and you don't hear as please anymore but
[52:58] as long as you're hungering and
[53:00] thirsting for God and I you know I I
[53:04] keep hearing tales and you know you
[53:06] don't know all the details about people
[53:08] coming to to to give their life to the
[53:11] Lord and and being turned away by
[53:13] ministers and saying you've you've
[53:16] passed beyond all hope and now that's
[53:18] one thing two things that I I I I I I'll
[53:22] say I I don't intend to ever do is one
[53:25] is tell somebody they've got the Holy
[53:26] Ghost and the other is tell somebody
[53:28] they have gone too far cuz you can't
[53:30] tell somebody they've got the I I don't
[53:32] believe you can cuz that's a personal
[53:33] revelation to them and and you can't
[53:36] tell somebody that they've gone too far
[53:38] because they will say it from their own
[53:41] mouth I don't want to remember that girl
[53:42] that that brother Brandon was talking to
[53:44] that she said if I saw my own Mama
[53:46] frying over Hill it wouldn't you know
[53:48] her heart was had grown so cold because
[53:50] she had turned God down so many times
[53:53] but now look at manasse and all the
[53:56] things that he's done and and this is my
[53:59] my my story a story of mercy and Grace
[54:02] amen how if you still are longing to
[54:04] come back to God and God Pricks your
[54:07] heart then there's still an opportunity
[54:10] for mercy and that's that's my my theme
[54:13] tonight is that all things are possible
[54:15] to them that believe and I was thinking
[54:18] earlier that it just it just staggers me
[54:21] to you know we were talking about the
[54:23] things that are how Mercy is removed
[54:25] from the Christian EXP experience how we
[54:27] can sing Listen to the brother brand
[54:29] sing that song all things are possible
[54:32] and then we'll remove uh the ability for
[54:35] somebody to get saved as we're singing
[54:37] all things are possible only believe
[54:40] only believe and that's that was really
[54:42] the the the theme of brother brandom's
[54:46] healing meetings his ministry was all
[54:49] things are possible if thou can't
[54:51] believe if thou can't believe it doesn't
[54:53] matter what your genealogy looks like if
[54:56] th can't believe then you can receive
[54:58] your healing if thou can't believe then
[55:00] there's an opportunity for
[55:02] salvation so verse n so Manasseh made
[55:05] Judah and then abidance of Jerusalem to
[55:07] Heir and to do worse than the Heathen
[55:08] whom the Lord had destroyed before the
[55:10] children of Israel and the Lord spake to
[55:12] manasse and to his people but they would
[55:14] not hearken wherefore the Lord brought
[55:16] unto them the captains of the host of
[55:17] the king of Assyria which took
[55:20] Manassa among the thorns and bound him
[55:23] with feathers and carried him to Babylon
[55:27] and there bound among the Thorns is
[55:29] where manasse got a change of heart and
[55:32] when he was in Affliction he besought
[55:34] the Lord his God and humbled himself
[55:36] greatly before the god of his fathers
[55:39] now I believe this is the the ground
[55:42] this lays the groundwork for the New
[55:44] Testament doctrine of if somebody is
[55:47] doing something that they ought living
[55:48] in sin then put them in God's hands and
[55:52] let him put them in thorns and
[55:54] affliction and they will watch him run
[55:57] back to
[55:58] God and so he was when he was in
[56:02] Affliction he besought the Lord his God
[56:04] and humbled himself greatly before the
[56:07] god of his fathers and prayed unto him
[56:09] and he was intreated of him and heard
[56:11] his supplication and brought him again
[56:14] to again to Jerusalem into his into his
[56:17] kingdom then manasse knew that the Lord
[56:21] he was God now there there's a great
[56:24] story of of of Mercy and I believe that
[56:27] that same you get in your head that in
[56:30] the Old Testament that God was there was
[56:32] no mercy in the Old Testament that God
[56:34] was a a hateful Jehovah and in the New
[56:37] Testament now he's he's merciful but you
[56:40] remember the story of David how David
[56:42] got the he when he numbered Israel he
[56:44] got the choice of of to be thrown into
[56:46] the hands of God or or to be thrown into
[56:48] the hands of man and he said oh I would
[56:50] rather be thrown into the hands of God
[56:52] way at throw me throw me straight into
[56:55] his hands because God is merciful and
[56:57] slow to anger and so many you know David
[57:01] knew we look at knowledge on the statute
[57:04] of a perfect man now David knew who his
[57:07] God was because he had a fellowship with
[57:10] him and he said in Psalm 528 but I am
[57:13] like a green olive tree in the house of
[57:15] God I trust in the mercy of God forever
[57:19] and ever and in 2 Samuel 24:14 what I
[57:22] was just I was just reading us and
[57:24] talking about in 2 Samuel 24 David said
[57:26] unto Gad I am in a great straight let us
[57:28] fall now into the hand of the Lord for
[57:31] his mercies are great and let me not
[57:33] fall into the hand of man now you know
[57:38] we're just reading about the story of
[57:40] Manasseh but now brother brandom when he
[57:43] would refer to the the seven Redemptive
[57:47] names of Jehovah a lot of times he would
[57:49] throw in Jehovah Manasseh which is not
[57:53] one of the seven Redemptive names of
[57:54] Jehovah and and uh manasse has an
[57:59] interesting meaning it
[58:02] means he
[58:04] forgets now if you look at the way when
[58:06] brother brandom uses Jehovah manasse put
[58:09] those two together Jehovah Manasseh and
[58:11] what do you end up with is that God
[58:14] forgets God forgets all of our all of
[58:17] the things that we've done just like
[58:19] manasse he forgets all of the now I I
[58:23] was watching uh I don't know if any of
[58:25] you ever watched Kirk Cameron and Ray
[58:27] Comfort do their you they kind of have a
[58:29] neat little television thing where I
[58:31] mean radio show uh I've seen some of
[58:33] their YouTube clips I don't watch TV uh
[58:37] but but um they they'll they had this
[58:41] thing where they were a debting atheist
[58:42] and one of them rose up and said now
[58:45] what I find it hard to believe is that
[58:47] that
[58:49] um that somebody that's well just like
[58:53] manasse did has done Witchcraft and
[58:56] enchantments and but the way they were
[58:58] is somebody that was a murderer a thief
[59:01] and and rattled off all these horrible
[59:02] sounding things that as soon as they
[59:04] come to God and and really repent that
[59:07] God wipes the Slate clean and that's a
[59:10] that's a that's an amazing thing isn't
[59:13] it and that doesn't really fit in with
[59:15] our concept of Justice we want people to
[59:17] pay you've got to suffer but God wipes
[59:21] the Slate clean for of a repentant heart
[59:24] and that's the grace of God I it's just
[59:27] it's just beyond imagining that God can
[59:30] do that you know I was reading through
[59:32] some of a list of some of the uh
[59:34] prisoners that had written into the
[59:36] voice of God website they post some of
[59:38] the uh letters from prisoners and it's
[59:40] just amazing the testimonies that they
[59:42] have things like now I I'm so glad that
[59:45] I finally found the truth I'm so glad
[59:48] that I know know the truth now and just
[59:52] just wonderful testimonies from people
[59:53] that you don't know their background you
[59:56] don't know but what they live lives
[59:58] similar to manasse but Manasseh uh I
[1:00:02] believe he found out that all things are
[1:00:05] possible to them that
[1:00:07] believe and Hebrews 7:25 says he was
[1:00:10] able to save them to the uttermost that
[1:00:12] come unto God by him
[1:00:17] now I had some interesting quotes
[1:00:20] because I I believe sometimes we
[1:00:22] struggle with that just that little
[1:00:23] simple all things are possible POs to
[1:00:26] them that believe and I I got I I I one
[1:00:30] of my favorite books is FF Bosworth's U
[1:00:32] Christ the Healer and because he he goes
[1:00:35] through you know brother R said nobody
[1:00:36] could explain healing like FF Bosworth
[1:00:39] and he explains one of the first things
[1:00:42] he deals with is that people believe yes
[1:00:45] I believe that in healing but it's so
[1:00:47] difficult sometimes to believe that
[1:00:49] healing is for me is it God's will to
[1:00:52] heal me is it God's will to save me and
[1:00:55] that's what I'm talking about this
[1:00:57] morning that God's mercy has been
[1:00:59] extended to us and if we'll receive his
[1:01:02] Mercy then it can be made manifest to it
[1:01:05] when you say well I've already got the
[1:01:06] Holy Ghost well maybe you need healing
[1:01:09] in your body maybe you need uh a little
[1:01:12] bit of extra from God because God's
[1:01:14] grace you can never exhaust God's grace
[1:01:17] do you know brother R said that God
[1:01:19] wants you to ask hard things and the
[1:01:22] hard things we'll think a hard thing is
[1:01:25] God help me I don't have enough money to
[1:01:27] buy a car help me to buy get a car or
[1:01:29] whatever but that things like that are
[1:01:30] are are small to God but the hard things
[1:01:33] are God help me the big things to God
[1:01:35] are help me to be a better Christian
[1:01:38] help me to live closer to you God put
[1:01:40] virtue in my life so much that it just
[1:01:42] bubbles out and just overflows that
[1:01:44] everybody can come and drink freely from
[1:01:46] the Fountain of Life that God has put in
[1:01:48] me and God put the knowledge of who you
[1:01:50] are and me and now those are big things
[1:01:53] and you know a lot of times in our mind
[1:01:55] will flipflop the big things to us are
[1:01:57] little to God and the little to us are
[1:01:59] big to God and maybe we need to get our
[1:02:02] mind lined up with his word so that so
[1:02:05] that to see things the way he sees them
[1:02:07] and and then maybe we'll start moving up
[1:02:10] the statue a little bit faster
[1:02:13] now let's see where I am in these in
[1:02:16] these
[1:02:17] notes um let's let's start off in 1956
[1:02:21] 1208 cuz I I want to backtrack a little
[1:02:23] bit and show how that when when you're
[1:02:25] hungry and thirsting for righteousness
[1:02:27] for Mercy that God will send somebody on
[1:02:29] the scene let's look at 1956 1208
[1:02:32] Abraham in Brooklyn New York paragraph
[1:02:35] e86 now here's a woman he knows the
[1:02:38] woman I don't know the lady I've never
[1:02:39] met you in my life there's not a way for
[1:02:41] me to know you but now if the Lord Jesus
[1:02:43] will speak again will it take all the
[1:02:45] superstitions and doubt from you now
[1:02:47] here she comes seeking mercy and he says
[1:02:49] now remember he's permitting this this
[1:02:52] is his grace to you and to me see by
[1:02:55] permitting a Divine gift to operate now
[1:02:58] let's go to the angel of the Covenant
[1:02:59] 1954 1954
[1:03:02] March please believe
[1:03:07] him if there's anything that I could do
[1:03:10] to help you I'd do it if there's one
[1:03:12] thing I could do to help anyone and
[1:03:14] wouldn't do it I'd be a brute not to do
[1:03:16] that but the reason I'm here trying to
[1:03:19] represent our Lord is because I believe
[1:03:21] by his Mercy to let me do it I believe I
[1:03:23] can help you to see him and believe him
[1:03:26] and be healed and that's how mercy and
[1:03:28] Grace is administered by God will send
[1:03:32] somebody on the scene to open your eyes
[1:03:34] to reveal to you to take to to take un
[1:03:38] loose the Yoke of the bondage of the
[1:03:40] things of this world uncover your eyes
[1:03:42] to take the scales off of your eyes like
[1:03:44] the prophet that prayed for Paul that
[1:03:46] the scales were over his eyes and he
[1:03:47] prayed for him and they came off and he
[1:03:49] can see clearly I believe I can help you
[1:03:52] to see him and believe him and be healed
[1:03:55] don't be scared that's the reason you
[1:03:57] can't receive is because you're afraid
[1:03:59] it won't happen now how about that the
[1:04:01] reason you can't receive is because
[1:04:03] you're afraid it won't happen when all
[1:04:06] the promises of God's word are laid out
[1:04:09] before us amen all the promises that we
[1:04:11] can rest
[1:04:13] upon like Psalm 501 14:15 offer unto God
[1:04:16] Thanksgiving and pay thy vows under the
[1:04:18] most high and call upon me in the day of
[1:04:19] trouble I will deliver thee right and
[1:04:22] thou shalt glorify me amen Galatians
[1:04:24] 5:116 this I say then walk in the spirit
[1:04:26] and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the
[1:04:29] flesh woo that's a promise amen walk in
[1:04:33] the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the
[1:04:35] lust of the flesh if you walk in the
[1:04:38] spirit James 4:7 submit yourselves
[1:04:41] therefore to God resist the devil and he
[1:04:43] will flee from you now we have all these
[1:04:46] promises but do we believe them like
[1:04:49] like I've heard brother Dale say before
[1:04:50] we've got all the tapes and everything
[1:04:53] uh maybe he didn't say exactly like this
[1:04:55] but now do we believe everything the
[1:04:56] prophet said do we believe all the words
[1:04:59] that the prophet has spoken do we
[1:05:02] believe everything do we believe it's
[1:05:05] for
[1:05:06] us that's the reason you can't receive
[1:05:09] is because you're afraid it won't happen
[1:05:10] just as in your mind it's already
[1:05:12] happened see faith is the substance of
[1:05:14] things hoped for the evidence of Things
[1:05:16] Not Seen that's
[1:05:19] right let's see I'll skip over that one
[1:05:23] skip over that one
[1:05:25] let's skip down to love in
[1:05:29] 1957 because this is what I and I think
[1:05:31] I'll go ahead and end on this just wrap
[1:05:34] up in a in just a few
[1:05:36] minutes but what you know like FF
[1:05:38] bondworth who's trying to in the little
[1:05:40] book Christ the Healer trying to get
[1:05:42] across and he's got some just wonderful
[1:05:44] scriptures laid out there to to battle
[1:05:47] that the the idea in your mind that it's
[1:05:51] not for me that healing is for somebody
[1:05:54] else well the same thing applies for
[1:05:56] salvation or the same thing for any of
[1:05:57] God's blessings asking big things to God
[1:06:00] anybody else somebody else can brother
[1:06:01] Dale can ask for big things but I can't
[1:06:04] or or anybody you got to be somebody
[1:06:07] somebody special but uh in God In Love
[1:06:13] 1957 uh May 19th paragraph
[1:06:17] e66 now Christ is here and I declare to
[1:06:21] you he's raised from the dead he loves
[1:06:23] you he wants your soul he wants to heal
[1:06:26] you he wants to make you happy he wants
[1:06:29] to bring you up in the glory he can only
[1:06:32] do it as you permit him to do it he
[1:06:34] can't do it against your will now we do
[1:06:37] we believe that he loves us that he he
[1:06:39] wants to heal us that he wants to make
[1:06:41] us happy now I so many I've got a book
[1:06:44] called The imitation of Christ that
[1:06:46] talks about how God that we grow closer
[1:06:48] to God through suffering now does God
[1:06:50] want us to
[1:06:52] suffer sometimes sometimes suffering is
[1:06:55] a means to an end like manasse when you
[1:06:57] when you sin and things and God puts you
[1:07:00] through the thorns a little bit like
[1:07:03] manasse but it's to bring you out so
[1:07:06] that you can be happy because God when
[1:07:08] you're happy you can serve God better
[1:07:10] when your home is at peace when your
[1:07:12] home is at every everything in your life
[1:07:14] is just orderly then you can serve God
[1:07:17] so much so much better and you know I
[1:07:19] believe that's one of the things you can
[1:07:20] bring before God if you're sick or
[1:07:22] whatever Lord please deliver me of this
[1:07:25] so so that I can serve you better so
[1:07:27] that I can walk before you greater in
[1:07:30] 1957 uh 602 e54 when we think about
[1:07:35] these things when we think about those
[1:07:37] things how great and
[1:07:39] wonderful oh he's real to us won't it be
[1:07:42] wonderful there the great physician is
[1:07:45] now present he wants to heal the sick
[1:07:47] and The Afflicted he wants to make those
[1:07:49] who are weary to be strong he wants to
[1:07:52] make those who are afflicted be well
[1:07:54] that's right now maybe a stumbling block
[1:07:59] you know FF PA will walk through all the
[1:08:01] different things that there stumbling
[1:08:02] blocks in our minds Paul's Affliction
[1:08:04] did Paul God want Paul to be sick uh
[1:08:07] what about the pool of Bethesda did uh
[1:08:09] why did God why did Jesus pass by all
[1:08:11] those people well you know brother
[1:08:12] brandom explained it that people would
[1:08:14] come up to him and say heal my uncle or
[1:08:17] pray for my uncle or whatever somebody
[1:08:19] that may not have even heard the gospel
[1:08:20] before first you must receive mercy
[1:08:23] first you got to you know cuz people
[1:08:25] would come in the prayer line and say uh
[1:08:27] heal my uh you know brother brother say
[1:08:31] well you're not even a Christian but if
[1:08:33] you'll just accept Christ right here on
[1:08:35] the prayer line they would accept Christ
[1:08:37] and be healed immediately after that
[1:08:39] that all that's one thing that always
[1:08:40] just Boggle my mind is that just two
[1:08:43] seconds after they said I I'll accept
[1:08:46] the pardon that Christ made that they
[1:08:48] could they would receive their healing
[1:08:49] just that
[1:08:51] quick but now you you've got to accept
[1:08:55] AC that mercy and they had to accept
[1:08:57] that Mercy just that quick on the on the
[1:08:59] platform they would accept it and and
[1:09:01] receive the
[1:09:03] grace he wants to make those who are
[1:09:05] afflicted be
[1:09:07] well in a time of decision 1959 April
[1:09:11] 18th
[1:09:15] now let me see where I should start now
[1:09:17] you've got to make up your mind you've
[1:09:19] got to make a choice and this may be
[1:09:22] your last time to make a choice tomorrow
[1:09:25] May too late God might have chose you to
[1:09:28] eternal life but if you don't make up
[1:09:30] your mind and accept it somebody else
[1:09:33] will take your place exactly that's
[1:09:36] right that's something to think about
[1:09:37] now and you remember that that quote
[1:09:39] that brother Dale read that that the
[1:09:40] reason you don't accept it when you're
[1:09:43] 12 years old is because there's a devil
[1:09:44] keeping you from that and you got if you
[1:09:47] can just receive it receive the truth
[1:09:51] and accept it and be delivered from
[1:09:53] that and if you don't see what the
[1:09:56] consequences my somebody else will take
[1:09:59] your place maybe tomorrow will be that
[1:10:00] time God may be wanting to empty this
[1:10:04] whole row of wheelchairs here tonight I
[1:10:07] know he
[1:10:08] does look at that now I know he does I
[1:10:12] know God wants to empty this whole row
[1:10:14] of wheelchairs here tonight I know he
[1:10:16] does he may be I know he wants to heal
[1:10:19] every sick person here tonight you'll
[1:10:22] have to make your choice what's keeping
[1:10:24] us from walking closer to God what's
[1:10:26] keeping us from receiving our healing
[1:10:29] what's keeping us from receiving the
[1:10:31] blessings that are written in God's word
[1:10:33] for us is that we're afraid we're
[1:10:37] unwilling to just Reach Out by faith and
[1:10:40] take it right and Witnesses
[1:10:43] 1956 now he is here tonight or he he
[1:10:46] said something that he can't back up and
[1:10:49] to think that someone would say that God
[1:10:51] put Affliction upon people to make them
[1:10:54] be his servants
[1:10:56] oh friend that's an error of the devil
[1:10:59] right if God Made You Afflicted so you
[1:11:01] could be patient and he could show his
[1:11:04] Mercy to let you suffer then when Jesus
[1:11:06] come he absolutely protested what God
[1:11:09] did he healed everyone he come in
[1:11:12] contact with then he done exactly what
[1:11:15] God made the people sick for his glory
[1:11:17] and Jesus come down and heal them then
[1:11:19] he took the glory off of them by healing
[1:11:21] them could you imagine that no sir not
[1:11:24] at all Jesus don't want you to suffer
[1:11:26] right listen friends people who say that
[1:11:29] the Pagan of Africa can produce a better
[1:11:31] God to the people my what a challenge
[1:11:35] than to say that God wants us to suffer
[1:11:37] the pagans can produce something better
[1:11:40] than something like that right no wonder
[1:11:42] we got communism God don't want you to
[1:11:44] suffer he wants you to be well he died
[1:11:47] for that purpose he don't want you to
[1:11:49] suffer he wants you to be well and he's
[1:11:51] made one basic thing if you'll believe
[1:11:54] he sent sent his word he sent his son he
[1:11:57] sent his prophets he sent law he sent
[1:12:00] everything and today sent the Holy
[1:12:02] Spirit to continue the ministry that
[1:12:04] Jesus did when he was here on
[1:12:07] Earth if we believe if we believe in
[1:12:10] God's mercy and his grace that he sent
[1:12:13] To Us by men that'll tell us about it
[1:12:17] then we can receive His blessings right
[1:12:20] if we'll receive it now uh I I'm just
[1:12:23] going to I'm going to finish here I
[1:12:24] guess the mus can go ahead and come
[1:12:26] forward but now remember
[1:12:28] Mercy Mercy ran to forgive the prodical
[1:12:32] son and then Grace threw a party right
[1:12:36] Mercy bandaged up the wounds of the of
[1:12:40] the man beaten up by the robbers and
[1:12:42] then the Sam Good Samaritan came along
[1:12:44] and bandaged him up and then he took him
[1:12:46] to the hotel and he paid the price of
[1:12:50] his recovery he gave out that gold corn
[1:12:53] Mercy heard the cry the thief on the
[1:12:56] cross and Grace promised in Paradise
[1:12:59] that same day amen that same hour that
[1:13:02] same minute Mercy paid the penalty for
[1:13:04] our sin and Grace substitutes God's
[1:13:08] righteousness in Christ for our
[1:13:10] wickedness Mercy converted Paul on the
[1:13:12] road to Damascus and Grace called him to
[1:13:14] be an apostle Mercy closed the door to
[1:13:18] hell and Grace open the door to Heaven
[1:13:22] do we believe that do we believe all all
[1:13:25] the promises of God are
[1:13:29] true I don't know how to stop I guess
[1:13:33] I'll I've just turn it over to brother
[1:13:35] Dale
[1:13:38] so if you
[1:13:41] stand amen bless
