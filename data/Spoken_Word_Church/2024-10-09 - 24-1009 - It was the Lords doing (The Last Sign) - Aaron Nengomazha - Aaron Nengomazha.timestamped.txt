[0:00] God bless you
[0:03] brother all right let's
[0:05] um uh greet you again in the name of the
[0:08] Lord if you're if you're neigh you can
[0:10] greet people five
[0:12] times but uh be prayer for us um so
[0:16] happy to be here uh we love this church
[0:18] we love your pastor um if you feel like
[0:21] you no longer have interest in him you
[0:23] can send him to us we'll be happy to
[0:26] have him we certainly enjoy his
[0:30] I'll be
[0:32] there so uh if you want him to retire or
[0:35] something like that we will happy to
[0:36] have him um but we we suddenly love this
[0:39] church and brother Bob and the different
[0:42] ministers uh last time I visited the
[0:45] church in North Carolina no not the last
[0:47] time the other time brother Bob was
[0:48] ministering and we had a wonderful time
[0:50] in the Lord and I thought this church is
[0:54] disproportionately blessed in the
[0:56] ministry amen so if we could stand and
[0:59] open Bibles to the Book of Matthew
[1:01] chapter
[1:02] 21 verse
[1:06] 42 Matthew chapter
[1:11] 21:32 we try not to keep you too long we
[1:14] believe in the message of the hour
[1:17] amen so we we try to keep it with within
[1:21] an
[1:25] hour Matthew chapter
[1:28] 21:42 the Bible says says if you have it
[1:31] you can say amen amen amen Jesus said
[1:34] unto
[1:35] them did you never read in the
[1:38] scriptures the stone which the builders
[1:41] rejected the same is become the head of
[1:43] the corner this is the Lord's doing and
[1:46] it is marvelous in our
[1:48] eyes therefore say unto you the kingdom
[1:51] of God shall be taken from you and be
[1:54] given to a nation bringing forth the
[1:56] fruits thereof this is when the kingdom
[1:59] was been taken from the Jews and being
[2:02] given to the
[2:03] Gentiles now now the kingdom is now
[2:06] moving from the Gentiles and going back
[2:08] to the Jews so so but but the
[2:11] inspiration is this verse 42 he says the
[2:15] the stone which the builders rejected
[2:18] the same is the head of the corner and
[2:21] there is where we draw our thought this
[2:23] is the Lord's
[2:24] doing and it is marvelous in our eyes we
[2:28] may have our seats
[2:30] for a little time tonight we want to
[2:32] talk about it was the Lord's doing and
[2:36] for a subtitle we want to talk about the
[2:39] last sign amen amen so Jesus Christ here
[2:42] our Lord was obviously preaching to the
[2:46] Pharisees because they would ask him
[2:48] questions and there's nothing wrong with
[2:50] asking God a genuine question but God
[2:54] looks at your motive behind the question
[2:58] and and and here you know know he was
[3:00] talking to the to the Pharisees to the
[3:03] to to the clergy of that day and he says
[3:06] didn't you read that the stone which the
[3:09] builders rejected and obviously this
[3:12] scripture is talking about uh uh the
[3:16] builders in our context are the
[3:18] ministers because the ministers are the
[3:21] builders amen amen and the prophet
[3:23] preached the message uh that day on
[3:26] Calvary right I mean the indictment it
[3:29] says they the clergy crucify it says
[3:33] they at the most holy place they the
[3:37] clergy crucify by blaspheming him the
[3:41] word amen because the clergy or the
[3:44] ministers we are the builders and the
[3:46] prophet will say we are not building a
[3:48] wall we are building a building and
[3:50] because we are building a building there
[3:51] are windows there are doors there are
[3:54] spots that look weak but that's okay God
[3:57] wants his building to be like that and
[3:59] if you want your building to pass
[4:00] inspection it has to have all these
[4:03] different aspects you have to have evens
[4:06] you got to have Windows you got to have
[4:07] you can't have only all the strong Parts
[4:10] you can't just make it all by break amen
[4:13] so you have to build it according to the
[4:16] blueprint praise the Lord so here our
[4:19] Lord was telling these people that this
[4:21] was the Lord's doing and it really
[4:24] struck my heart that whatever was
[4:26] happening it was not the devil doing it
[4:29] amen no it was God who was actually
[4:32] doing that it was God who who chose
[4:35] things to come a certain way it was God
[4:39] who elected before the foundation of the
[4:41] world how his gospel was going to come
[4:45] and who was going to present it because
[4:47] everything was made by the word and we
[4:50] outside of the word was not anything
[4:53] made which was made so everything was
[4:56] made by the word for him amen that's
[4:59] what the Bible says in Colossians
[5:01] everything was made by him and for him
[5:05] so really that's why we we we have
[5:08] received this kingdom yes and and the
[5:10] word Kingdom means kingship and domain
[5:14] it's just a compound word kingdom and
[5:16] domain now kingdom is different from a
[5:19] democracy in a democracy people may
[5:22] decide we want this we want that that's
[5:24] okay but in a kingdom the kingdom the
[5:28] king brings the rules the king is the
[5:31] one who says this is what I want and
[5:34] usually it's not negotiable but in a
[5:36] democracy you can do whatever you want
[5:39] you can say well I choose to be a cat or
[5:41] I choose to be this because that's your
[5:43] choice but in a kingdom you don't do
[5:46] that they are Kingdom principles amen
[5:49] praise be the name of the Lord so now
[5:52] the Lord Jesus Christ is that stone and
[5:55] he's the stone that the builders
[5:57] rejected in the message dedication the
[5:59] prophet say is it was an old looking
[6:01] Stone yes right and the and the Builder
[6:04] they sort of like thought you know what
[6:05] let's just put it aside you know let's
[6:08] just put it aside because it was not a
[6:09] usual Stone it wasn't something so
[6:12] appealing it was something that was a
[6:15] little bit unusual and that stone is
[6:18] Jesus Christ and who is Jesus Christ
[6:20] Jesus Christ is the word amen when we
[6:23] say the word we're not just talking
[6:26] about a quot or a scripture the word is
[6:29] the full word because the word is a
[6:32] person now this is my hand but for me to
[6:36] be a person I have to have my entire
[6:38] being so when we say the word we mean
[6:41] the fullness of the word so when we say
[6:44] receive the word the word the word is
[6:46] it's not just a scripture you can have a
[6:49] scripture but not have the word because
[6:51] the devil can't cut the scripture
[6:54] because he CED it to
[6:56] Jesus hen he had the scripture but he
[6:59] did not have the word but the word was
[7:02] Christ who was the person of the word am
[7:06] amen so when we when we talk when we
[7:09] talk about the word we are talking about
[7:11] having the fullness of what God wants in
[7:14] our time amen hallelujah so sometimes
[7:17] when you hear ministers saying the word
[7:19] the word you wondering what does it mean
[7:21] is it like the Quran no it's not like
[7:23] you know like ethical books or other
[7:25] religions no it's Jesus Christ the word
[7:28] the logos John 1 verse one in the
[7:31] beginning was the word and the Word was
[7:34] with God and the Word was God and that
[7:37] word became
[7:39] flesh amen now Romans chapter 9:32 uh
[7:44] Paul talking about the Jews you know
[7:46] Romans 9 Romans 10 you know Paul talks
[7:49] about the Jews how you know the story of
[7:52] because he was burdened off about over
[7:54] the Jews that's right just like our
[7:56] Prophet was burdened for the Gentile
[7:58] church cuz every two Prophet every two
[8:00] servant will be have a burden because
[8:02] that's how God works God works with a
[8:05] burden he does not work with an
[8:07] obsession he works with a burden there's
[8:10] a difference between an obsession and a
[8:13] burden because a a burden is governed
[8:16] it's it has love it's it's it it has got
[8:19] you know it's not you know harassment no
[8:23] it's a burden praise the
[8:25] Lord and that's how you differentiate
[8:28] love and last
[8:30] because last is is is is something that
[8:34] is unsatiable it's it's it's harassing
[8:37] it's something that is but a burden it's
[8:40] it's it's governed amen now Romans says
[8:44] wherefore because they sought it not by
[8:46] faith but as it were by The Works of the
[8:47] law for they stumbled at that stumbling
[8:50] Stone as it is written behold I lay a
[8:54] stone in I behold I lay in Zion a
[8:57] stumbling Stone a rock of offense
[9:00] and whosoever believeth on him shall not
[9:02] be ashamed so he's talking about the
[9:04] Jews that they stumbled at The Stumbling
[9:08] Stone so because God is the one who said
[9:11] I lay a stone in Zion because remember
[9:14] in Matthew he said we the Bible says
[9:16] that it was the Lord's doing and it is
[9:19] marvelous in our eyes in other words it
[9:22] is beautiful to see it was God who did
[9:25] it Hallelujah it it was by design that
[9:29] God made things that way and here Paul
[9:32] is saying the Jews they stumbled at The
[9:34] Stumbling Stone because God said I'm
[9:37] going to lay the stone in Zion that's
[9:40] why John say blessed is he when when
[9:42] Jesus Christ said that John was taken
[9:44] and was being was killed he says blessed
[9:47] is he who is not offended in me because
[9:51] you know what God laid the stumbling
[9:54] block and the stumbling blocks was not
[9:56] to stumble his children it was not to
[9:58] stumble those who genuinely want to know
[10:01] more about God but it is to stand for
[10:03] those who think they are wise those who
[10:06] think they are prudent those who think
[10:08] they're knowledgeable and God
[10:10] deliberately hid it from the eyes of the
[10:13] wise but he gave it unto babies such as
[10:16] would learn which is you and me tonight
[10:19] praise the
[10:20] Lord this is why you find that God
[10:24] picked a hillbilly from the hills of
[10:26] Kentucky a man who did not have you know
[10:29] more than gr s you know education it was
[10:32] not by coincidence it was not by his own
[10:35] desire but it was the Lord's doing
[10:38] Others May criticize but it is marvelous
[10:40] in our
[10:41] eyes glory be to God Amen some people
[10:45] might might think that God was a poor
[10:47] engineer to bring the children of Israel
[10:49] through the Red Sea there was a mountain
[10:52] on this side there was a mountain on
[10:53] that side there was an Egyptian Army
[10:55] following behind them but it was the
[10:57] Lord's doing and it's beautiful in our
[11:00] eyes am if I was to choose I would not
[11:04] choose Jonah probably being as a human
[11:07] being I said you know Jonah is a man
[11:09] he's got Tantrums let's find someone
[11:11] who's who is more
[11:15] stable and more
[11:17] reliable someone who's more zealous
[11:20] that's human mind but you know what God
[11:22] our thoughts are not as his thoughts
[11:25] God's thoughts is not as our thoughts
[11:28] God chose a man who was running away
[11:30] from that commission and when God did
[11:33] not destroy Nineveh Jonah was
[11:36] angry he was sitting there angry and God
[11:39] sent a goat and he sent an insect and
[11:42] and did destroy that and he was angry
[11:44] because he wanted to see those people
[11:47] destroyed and as a human being you say
[11:49] why would God choose a man like that you
[11:51] know what that was the Lord's doing and
[11:53] it is beautiful in our eyes it was the
[11:56] Lord's doing I think about I don't know
[11:58] about think about myself why would God
[12:01] choose me I mean there are many better
[12:04] people out there I am the least of the
[12:06] least and I'm the worst of the worst I
[12:09] don't deserve any Grace I don't deserve
[12:12] to know this message of the hour I don't
[12:14] deserve to know the mysteries of this
[12:16] Bible I don't deserve to be part of the
[12:18] Bride why did God choose me there was
[12:20] nothing in me that could be desired but
[12:23] it was the Lord's doing it was the
[12:26] Lord's doing and it is beautiful before
[12:28] our eyes amen hallelujah and why did God
[12:31] give you brother way as a pastor someone
[12:34] might think oh can we find someone
[12:36] better you know what it was the Lord's
[12:37] doing and it is beautiful in our
[12:40] eyes
[12:42] Hallelujah that's why God gave you the
[12:44] wife that you
[12:46] have it's not a mistake it was go it was
[12:50] by God's design and the prophet says one
[12:52] of the reason why Moses was the meest
[12:54] man upon the Earth it was because of
[12:57] zipora because Z kept him in
[13:02] line he would be out there as a prophet
[13:05] people fear him that says the Lord let
[13:07] there be fleas and there'll be fleas but
[13:10] back home it was very soft good evening
[13:15] honey how was your
[13:18] day and the Bible says Moses was the
[13:20] meest man upon the Earth so you never
[13:23] know how the ways that God can use to
[13:26] keep you in check cuz if you had
[13:29] everything your way maybe you will not
[13:31] be here but God put Rod blocks and you
[13:34] know and speed bumps along the way
[13:36] something to slow you down your parents
[13:38] slows you down your teenage children
[13:41] they slow you
[13:42] down can you say amen amen someone said
[13:46] you're not a parent until you have
[13:48] teenagers so I can I can I can declare
[13:51] today I'm not yet a parent I have two
[13:53] girls but I'm not yet a
[13:55] parent because they're not yet teenagers
[13:57] amen but uh we love our teenagers now
[14:01] Luke chap 11: 29 and when the people
[14:04] were gathered were gathered thick
[14:07] together he began to say this is an evil
[14:09] generation they seek a sign and they
[14:12] shall no sign be given it but the sign
[14:15] of Jonah the
[14:16] prophet for as Jonah was a sign unto the
[14:21] nites now Jonah himself was assigned to
[14:25] the
[14:26] Levites right Jonah did not have a sign
[14:29] he was the sign so a prophet is a sign
[14:35] amen amen amen so a prophet when you see
[14:38] a prophet you are seeing a sign amen
[14:42] right we're expecting a hurricane you
[14:44] know what the people they see they they
[14:46] they they look at the satellite maps and
[14:48] they see the winds and they see and they
[14:50] say you know what there's a hurricane
[14:51] coming because they see the signs they
[14:54] see all those things but we as Believers
[14:57] when a prophet steps upon the sin he
[15:00] himself before he says anything a
[15:03] prophet in himself is a sign
[15:08] am even the Bride is a sign also you
[15:11] having a long hair walking on campus
[15:13] that's a sign having a long dress and as
[15:16] a right vow you are a sign to this
[15:18] generation that God is going to judge
[15:20] this generation but you are a little a
[15:23] small sign but a prophet is a larger
[15:26] sign of you know God dealing with the
[15:28] Earth that's why the prophet says a
[15:31] message and the messenger are one amen
[15:35] because Jonah was not only preaching but
[15:38] he was leaving what he was going to
[15:40] preach amen because the Book of Jonah is
[15:43] not just made of things that he said it
[15:46] also talks about things that he did and
[15:50] the things the actions that he took and
[15:53] whatever he did is part of the word so
[15:56] Jonah's life is also the word of God am
[16:00] because a prophet's
[16:02] life is also the word of God I know
[16:06] that's too hard for you but that's the
[16:08] Bible That's the Bible you said brother
[16:11] Aon don't tell me that just give me the
[16:12] Bible okay let's go to the Bible what is
[16:15] the Bible what is the Book of
[16:18] Esther you don't find the word Jehovah
[16:21] in the Book of
[16:22] Esther you don't find the word the Lord
[16:25] or you know Elohim in the Book of Esther
[16:28] but is the Bible amen so the life of
[16:31] Esther was it the life of Esther or was
[16:34] it the life of
[16:35] God the Bible talks about Joseph was it
[16:39] the life of Joseph or was it the Life of
[16:42] Christ right if it was just the life of
[16:44] Joseph then it should not be in the
[16:46] Bible but because it's in the Bible is
[16:48] the word of God because Joseph's life
[16:51] was the life of God that's why it became
[16:54] part of the
[16:55] Bible so if the Bible would be written
[16:58] to today if you are a True Believer your
[17:01] life would be in that Bible because the
[17:04] life that you have is no longer your
[17:06] life but it's the life of God it becomes
[17:09] the life of Jesus
[17:12] Christ and we are part of the Bible
[17:14] that's why the book of Acts does not
[17:16] have an amen because it continues to be
[17:18] written up to this day amen so when we
[17:22] talk about Martin Luther when we talk
[17:24] about Wesley we are not talking about
[17:26] the story of a man it's different from
[17:29] somebody trying to write a best selling
[17:31] New York Times or a memoir or you know
[17:33] what do you call it biography autography
[17:35] whatever they call it is different it's
[17:38] a book of life that's why Paul says when
[17:41] Christ who is our life shall appear amen
[17:44] because what he's saying is that Christ
[17:46] himself he is the very life of us and
[17:49] the prophet calls that scripture in the
[17:51] church ages that the bride she is him
[17:55] yeah now so it's it's it's in the
[17:58] prophet but does not stop with the
[17:59] prophet it also flows to the bride but
[18:02] you have to understand first that God
[18:05] deals with a generation through a
[18:07] prophet and the prophet is a sign so
[18:10] Jonah reading as a kind of man you may
[18:13] think he made a mistake he disobeyed God
[18:15] by going to tashes but you know what
[18:18] what he was doing he was declaring the
[18:21] word of the Lord
[18:22] amen when Moses married a colard girl
[18:25] from
[18:26] Ethiopia I wouldn't blame him but you
[18:29] see come
[18:30] on people thought he was making a
[18:33] mistake yeah why would you marry a
[18:35] colard girl you he was even
[18:37] contradicting his own Bible that he had
[18:39] WR the people and people would criticize
[18:42] Moses you're a hypocrite you are telling
[18:45] us we should marry from the Jews but
[18:47] here you are you take a girl from from
[18:49] Ethiopia and you bring her in the camp
[18:51] right right but you know what the
[18:53] prophet says he was a type of Christ cuz
[18:56] he married a gentile bride now that is
[18:59] not to say that we should go around and
[19:01] just you know no a prophet is a sign
[19:05] amen hallelujah when Rahab was living
[19:08] her life when we read the Bible today we
[19:10] say oh that was a beautiful type but
[19:12] guess what she wasn't thinking that when
[19:15] she was going through what she was going
[19:16] through when she was sold in
[19:19] prostitution she was wondering Lord why
[19:22] am I like this why do I have to go
[19:25] through this but in h sight in hindsight
[19:29] when we read about that we say Oh What a
[19:31] Beautiful story when people if the Bible
[19:34] would be written about your life people
[19:36] would say what a beautiful story but
[19:39] tonight you are wondering how am I going
[19:40] to pay my
[19:41] mortgage how am I going to pay for the
[19:44] gas how am I going to get my teenage to
[19:46] through school and keeping it in the
[19:48] Lord you are wondering but if somebody
[19:51] would read your life in Insight they'll
[19:54] say wow what a beautiful Christian story
[19:58] brother see we don't know what what what
[20:00] is happening but you know what by and by
[20:03] we shall all understand it better by and
[20:05] by we shall know why things happen this
[20:07] way we shall know why things that to go
[20:09] this way but just hold on my brother God
[20:12] knows where he's taking you to because
[20:15] the bride shall judge the Earth amen the
[20:19] bride shall judge the Earth we have to
[20:22] have people who judge the plumbers but
[20:24] you have to be a good plumber to judge a
[20:26] bad plumber we have to be have
[20:28] accountants to judge the bad CPAs that's
[20:32] right we we got to have good pastors to
[20:34] be able to judge bad pastors so God has
[20:37] a a position reserved for you in glory
[20:41] and your life is to match the reward
[20:44] right amen think about it if you sign
[20:47] for a job and they say all right we're
[20:50] going to pay you a 100,000 a
[20:52] year the job the responsibility that
[20:56] they give you they make sure that it's
[20:57] commensurate right with what they're
[20:59] going to pay
[21:01] you is that right so whatever God gives
[21:05] you on this Earth he has to be
[21:07] commensurated with the reward that he
[21:09] has reserved for you so if you say this
[21:12] is too much for me you don't know the
[21:14] glory that God has reserved for you and
[21:17] we will not have the same Glory we will
[21:19] not have the same Glory we will be
[21:22] different one from the other we are all
[21:24] stars but we have different Glory that's
[21:27] why the prophet one time was walking in
[21:30] the office of Oral Roberts and he was
[21:32] discouraged sometimes we get
[21:35] discouraged and said Lord I know you
[21:37] couldn't trust me with these things but
[21:39] I'm so thankful that you found a man
[21:41] that you could
[21:42] trust and God said hey buddy look up y
[21:47] look up I am your portion there is a
[21:50] great reward for you waiting for you
[21:52] amen amen but you know what he was
[21:54] almost gone like David said my feet were
[21:57] almost gone when I thought about when I
[21:59] saw the evil how you have blessed them
[22:01] how you have they have spread but one
[22:03] day I was in the temple and the Lord
[22:06] showed me their end when God gives you
[22:09] when he lifts you up and he gives you
[22:11] this perspective then you are able to
[22:13] see that yeah there's not coincidence
[22:15] God knows what he's doing with your life
[22:18] amen and never compare yourself with the
[22:20] next person because you know what you
[22:23] have different places reserved in
[22:26] glory if you would exchange your situ
[22:28] situation with your neighbor you would
[22:30] come back after 10 minutes and say I
[22:33] think I was good with with what I had
[22:37] amen amen
[22:39] hallelujah it's like when I was in
[22:41] Africa you know I was thinking you know
[22:43] what if I go to to the United States
[22:45] I'll have a good life I'll have a good
[22:48] paying job and all these things I was
[22:50] very excited which is good I'm still
[22:51] excited it's a good country amen but
[22:53] when I came here I also found other
[22:57] problems like
[22:59] man trying to be women and women trying
[23:01] to be a man and I was being faced with a
[23:03] different kind of problem and somebody
[23:06] may arue you know what was I happy when
[23:09] I didn't have much but I was living in a
[23:11] normal society you see so what what it
[23:15] tells you is that there's no place that
[23:18] we can call our home here on Earth our
[23:20] home is there in glory because some are
[23:24] dealing with the hurricane some are
[23:25] dealing we are all dealing with
[23:26] something but you know what these are
[23:28] all birth ples because one of these days
[23:30] we're going to live out of this Earth
[23:33] and meet our
[23:34] King but some people they think if this
[23:37] man gets voted in things will change
[23:39] nothing will change it will get worse
[23:42] and worse and worse and the prophet says
[23:44] even if we put Abraham Lincoln in every
[23:46] County that's right you can never save
[23:48] someone who rejects the word when a
[23:50] nation rejects a prophet or the Bible
[23:55] the Bible principles there is no
[23:57] politician that can save that
[23:59] Nation if we take Bibles out of school
[24:02] we take Bibles out of people and we
[24:05] think someone will come and save us
[24:08] that's a
[24:11] lie amen so Jonah was a sign Isaiah the
[24:15] prophet was a sign the Bible says in
[24:17] Isaiah 20:2 at the same time spake the
[24:20] Lord by Isaiah the son of amamos saying
[24:22] go and lose the SE cloth from off thy
[24:24] loins and put off thy clothes and put
[24:28] off uh thy uh thy shoe from from thy
[24:31] foot and he did so walking naked
[24:35] Barefoot you see how God works now if
[24:38] this would happen in our time what would
[24:40] people think they thought Isaiah was
[24:43] insane that's why most prophets were
[24:46] persecuted and killed because they were
[24:49] considered Heretics how would someone
[24:52] say the Lord told me to take off my my
[24:55] clothes and walk naked without shoes
[24:58] right because it was not enough for God
[25:02] for God to just send Isaiah to give a
[25:05] word Isaiah had to leave the symbol of
[25:09] it because as a prophet he is a
[25:12] representation of God Amen so God would
[25:15] say I want you to cook bread but I want
[25:17] you to use poop to make that
[25:20] bread amen that's in the
[25:22] Bible because the Bible is the Bible
[25:25] amen and the Bible does not care about
[25:28] our feelings or political correctness
[25:32] God is God and God is
[25:34] Sovereign he does what he wants because
[25:38] if God is subject to ourself then he's
[25:40] no longer God if God is subject to our
[25:44] thoughts and our standard then he seases
[25:47] to be God God has to be higher than our
[25:49] thoughts and our standards for him to
[25:52] remain God and God has to be Sovereign
[25:55] in order for him to stay as God if then
[25:58] he's subject to what we want he's no
[26:00] longer God but for you to be a king you
[26:03] have to be Sovereign so the prophet says
[26:05] he is an infinite Sovereign yes that's
[26:08] right amen so so so so Isaiah was a sign
[26:12] and he was walking barefoot and walking
[26:15] without shoes as a sign and the Lord
[26:18] said like as my servant Isaiah has
[26:21] walked naked and Barefoot 3 years for a
[26:23] sign and they Wonder upon Egypt and upon
[26:26] Ethiopia so shall the king of of Assyria
[26:29] lead away the Egyptians prisoners and
[26:31] the and the and the ethopians captives
[26:33] young and old naked and Barefoot even
[26:35] with their BS and covered to the shame
[26:38] of
[26:39] Egypt Isaiah was the sign and the people
[26:43] were supposed to see Isaiah and read the
[26:45] sign one time the prophet was in the
[26:47] west coast and the Lord said to him pick
[26:50] up a stone and throw it says thus says
[26:53] the Lord judgment is striking Alaska but
[26:57] being a prophet Propet he had to do the
[26:59] Dem he had to take the stone and throw
[27:02] it that's how God works so when you see
[27:05] so he said brother what are you why are
[27:07] you why are you talking about this
[27:09] because I want you I don't want us to
[27:11] miss what God has done for us in our day
[27:15] or just to think that you know a prophet
[27:16] is just like any other regular Minister
[27:18] out there or maybe we're trying to
[27:21] glorify a man no we glorify Jesus am but
[27:24] you know what Jesus Christ came to John
[27:27] and he gave him the ration and John says
[27:29] the Revelation that God gave me which
[27:32] was signified by an Angel so the
[27:35] Revelation could only be signified by an
[27:38] Angel
[27:40] amen amen amen he did not just receive
[27:44] it from thin air it was an angel that
[27:47] signified it to John and today there's
[27:51] an Angel and the word Angel there means
[27:53] a messenger an Earthly messenger who
[27:56] comes and signifies the Revelation to
[27:59] the
[28:00] church
[28:02] amen that's why the denominations are
[28:05] going in darkness because they don't
[28:07] have the lamp that's right they don't
[28:09] have the light right right because a
[28:11] messenger is a light to the age amen now
[28:15] the Bible says and aijah caught the new
[28:17] garment that was on him and rent it in
[28:19] 12 pieces and he said to jeroboam take
[28:22] the 10 pieces for thus says the Lord God
[28:25] of Israel behold I will Ren the kingdom
[28:27] out of the hand of Solomon and will give
[28:30] 10 tribes to thee now I'm I'm reading a
[28:33] lot of scripture so that you know we
[28:34] have got young people coming up they
[28:35] want to know why we are saying certain
[28:38] things they think having a prophet like
[28:41] brother Braham is just a new phenomenal
[28:43] no we have always had prophets and God
[28:45] has always dealt with the people through
[28:47] the prophets right amen and these signs
[28:50] they were always there so like this man
[28:53] here he tore the Garment of of Elijah of
[28:56] Elijah right and he says I'm going to
[28:57] give you 10 pieces which was
[29:00] representing the 10 tribes of Israel and
[29:03] he said I'm going to give the two other
[29:05] pieces to Solomon right that's when the
[29:08] kingdom was divided it was God who did
[29:11] it for his own Glory but the sign was
[29:14] the Garment that was Tor by the prophet
[29:19] amen hallelujah hosia I'm going to I'm
[29:23] going to skip I'm going to turn a corner
[29:24] from these signs but just maybe one more
[29:27] the Bible says in the beginning of the
[29:28] word of the Lord by Hosea and the Lord
[29:30] said unto Hosea go take unto thee a wife
[29:33] of
[29:34] WS and the children of WS for the land
[29:37] hath committed great w departing from
[29:40] the Lord so God is telling Hosea the
[29:42] prophet go and marry someone from the
[29:46] brothel an ill famed woman and he was a
[29:51] prophet now if this would happen in our
[29:54] time what would people
[29:56] think they would go on social media yeah
[30:00] yeah and say we have got a man who is
[30:02] losing his mind yeah
[30:04] right right you
[30:06] know God says thus says the Lord go and
[30:10] marry a
[30:12] prostitute forget about all the virgins
[30:14] in Israel find The Prostitute marry her
[30:17] and have children and HOSA would go
[30:20] sometimes and have to take her wife from
[30:22] the from the brothers because she would
[30:24] go back to the beer house and he would
[30:27] go and say honey come back home because
[30:29] he was a sign cuz that's what God was
[30:32] doing to Israel he would go to Israel
[30:35] they come back and then after a while
[30:36] they go back to idolatry and that's what
[30:39] HOSA was doing because HOSA was supposed
[30:42] to show the sign amen
[30:46] amen
[30:48] amen John Chapter 13 verse1 let's read
[30:51] it together the Bible says now before
[30:54] the Feast of the Passover when Jesus
[30:55] knew that his hour has come had he could
[30:58] he should depart out of this world unto
[31:01] the father having loved his own which
[31:04] were in the world he loved them un the
[31:06] end I love the love of Jesus it's unto
[31:09] the end and me I I I skipped to verse
[31:12] five and after he pour pour water into a
[31:15] basson and began to wash the disciples
[31:17] feet and to wipe them with the towel
[31:20] wherewith he was GED then cometh he to
[31:23] Simon Peter and Peter said unto him Lord
[31:26] do thou wash my feet feet yeah he said
[31:29] Peter was always on the
[31:31] extreme at one point he says don't wash
[31:33] my feet and God then Jesus Christ said
[31:36] if I don't wash your feet you have no
[31:38] part in me then he go to the Other
[31:41] Extreme and says wash my whole
[31:46] body Jesus answered and said unto him
[31:49] what what I do thou knowest not now but
[31:53] Thou shalt know Hereafter amen so Jesus
[31:56] Christ said I was I'm going to show you
[31:58] an example but the way I'm going to do
[32:01] it I'm going to demonstrate it to you
[32:04] because remember the Bible says in him
[32:06] was light in the light was the life of
[32:09] man am so the word can only G bring
[32:13] forth light if it is manifested amen but
[32:16] the prophet says the first light was the
[32:19] spoken word amen but the light had to be
[32:23] manifested for us to know that this is
[32:25] the spoken word so Jesus was not a logos
[32:28] out there but he became flesh when he
[32:31] became flesh he was the light that was
[32:34] manifested so the life that we live is
[32:38] the manifestation of the light am it's
[32:40] not enough just to have spoken words and
[32:42] tapes and just put them on a shelf we
[32:45] have to manifest the life of those of
[32:48] that word if we are to able to touch our
[32:50] children and touch our neighbors if we
[32:53] don't display their life we are wasting
[32:55] our time you can call it to to them you
[32:59] can play it to them you can repeat it
[33:01] but you have to leave it and show it to
[33:04] them because life without being
[33:06] manifested is it cannot be seen by
[33:10] people so Jesus wanting to demonstrate
[33:13] how the disciples ought to treat one
[33:16] another he had actually to perform a
[33:19] demonstration of the life and he washed
[33:22] his disciples dirty feet he did not just
[33:26] cut it to them no he displayed it and he
[33:29] showed them and the disciples they
[33:32] learned more from what he lived more
[33:34] than what he
[33:35] said that's why when they saw that he's
[33:39] was a prayer man of prayer they became
[33:41] so thirsty and they said Master teach us
[33:45] to pray because they had seen that he
[33:48] was a man of prayer because the prophet
[33:50] says the only way you can win the world
[33:52] is if you become salty and when you
[33:55] become salty people become thirsty when
[33:57] people become thirsty they ask for the
[33:59] water but you want to give water to
[34:02] people who are not thirsty and they
[34:04] cannot be thirsty unless you are saled
[34:07] amen so when you live the life it makes
[34:10] people
[34:11] feel thirsty amen if you want your
[34:15] children to come to church with you you
[34:17] have to live the life before them if you
[34:19] want your wife to call you master you
[34:22] have to live the life before her amen
[34:25] you can't be pointing a finger and say
[34:27] hey don't you know know Abraham called
[34:28] his Sarah called his Lord his master his
[34:31] husband
[34:32] Lord it was the life that Abraham
[34:35] displayed that Sarah said my Lord not
[34:39] Lord Adonai like God lord as in
[34:43] interpreted as Master because he
[34:46] displayed
[34:48] aive amen and if there a song we used to
[34:51] sing if I be lifted up from the earth I
[34:54] draw all men unto myself the world is
[34:57] angry to see a living Christ everyone
[35:00] can call it everyone can throw it on
[35:03] WhatsApp and and and social media
[35:05] everyone can for the court but people
[35:07] are looking for a displayed
[35:11] life the children of Israel they could
[35:13] hold a lamp for 3 days but Moses said at
[35:17] the evening time after 3 days of walking
[35:21] with your lamp packing your lamp you
[35:24] must slay that lamp and apply the blood
[35:28] and when you apply the blood then you
[35:30] overcome
[35:32] death but if it's not enough to just
[35:34] hold the lamp and and walk with the lamp
[35:39] and hold the tape you must slay the tape
[35:42] and apply it in your
[35:44] life that's how you do that's how you
[35:47] overcome death when you apply the
[35:50] token you can have a horse take on the
[35:53] Shelf it's not going to help you you've
[35:56] got to take that word and apply it in
[35:59] your life and can I tell you something
[36:02] it was not Moses who applied the blood
[36:05] Moses was only responsible for declaring
[36:07] the word it was the responsibility of
[36:10] each father of the house to apply the
[36:12] token in their own house your pastor is
[36:15] not going to come and tell you what to
[36:17] watch what not to watch what to do what
[36:19] not to do in your own house that's your
[36:20] own responsibility and you're going to
[36:22] give an account of the atmosphere that
[36:25] you create in your own house am amen
[36:28] Amen brother and some of the problems
[36:32] they have got nothing to do with the
[36:33] ministry Moses declared slay the lamp
[36:37] it's your job as an individual as a
[36:39] mother as a father as a priest of the
[36:42] house to apply the blood to say honey we
[36:45] we can't have this in this house brother
[36:47] Bram told Billy po my son you if you
[36:50] choose this road I cannot stay with you
[36:53] right because there's a certain
[36:54] atmosphere we have to keep in this house
[36:57] I cannot force you to to follow this way
[37:00] but if you want to follow this way
[37:01] you're going to have to find somewhere
[37:03] to live that was a man who had applied
[37:05] blood upon his house but yet he still
[37:09] loved his son though he left the house
[37:11] he still met him he still loved him he
[37:13] still prayed for him he did not just
[37:15] give up on him he applied the blood even
[37:18] when he was away said Lord help my boy
[37:21] Lord help my boy but today we want the
[37:23] minister to do all the religion for us
[37:27] as long as as I listen to your tape you
[37:28] have to apply the tape don't just listen
[37:31] to
[37:32] it apply the tape the Bible says he that
[37:35] is an ear let him hear what the what the
[37:38] spirit says to the churches because
[37:40] everyone has ears but when the Bible
[37:42] says he that is an e means he that can
[37:45] apply because he understands what is
[37:48] being
[37:49] said and the Bible says unless a man is
[37:51] born again he cannot see the kingdom of
[37:54] God he cannot understand because
[37:56] understanding it's a when you have a
[37:58] revelation it changes your life if your
[38:01] life is not changed it's not a
[38:03] revelation it's just
[38:06] knowledge like you can ask anyone on the
[38:08] streets who is Jesus they'll tell you
[38:10] Jesus Christ is the king but not
[38:13] everyone is saved because they know it
[38:15] from here but it's not there but when
[38:17] you know it by Revelation and when you
[38:20] know it by life then it changes your
[38:24] conduct it changes your speech it ch
[38:27] changes your your the way you treat one
[38:29] another it changes the way you meditate
[38:32] it changes your whole makeup am amen
[38:37] hallelujah so Jesus demonstrated life to
[38:40] his
[38:42] disciples and he says you call me master
[38:45] and Lord and you say well for so I am
[38:49] and if I then your Lord and Master have
[38:52] washed your feet you
[38:54] also ought to wash one another's feet
[38:57] for I have given you an example amen he
[39:00] did not just give them a coat he showed
[39:04] them an example amen and sometimes why
[39:07] children get confused is because they
[39:08] don't have an example at home right Mom
[39:11] is saying this but she's doing this Dad
[39:14] is saying this but she's acting this the
[39:16] poppet is going this way the father is
[39:18] going this way the mother is going this
[39:20] way and the child is
[39:23] confused but when there is
[39:25] harmony amen under headship when there's
[39:28] Harmony when when the when the spirit
[39:30] and the bride say the same thing when
[39:33] the father and the mother they say the
[39:34] same thing not when the child knows well
[39:37] Dad may allow me to to to my dad may not
[39:39] allow me to do this but Mom will allow
[39:41] me or vice versa then you have a problem
[39:44] right you don't have to be the same a
[39:47] mom has to be a mom a dad has to be a
[39:49] dad but the doctrine should have
[39:54] Harmony Amen in him was life and the
[39:57] life was the light of man the light
[39:59] shines in darkness and darkness
[40:01] comprehended it amen not now the prophet
[40:04] says now we find that his Royal seed it
[40:06] travels the same Journey that Abraham
[40:09] did right and and the last sign that
[40:13] Abraham seen before the promised son
[40:15] came was when God was manifested in a
[40:18] human body amen and two angels came down
[40:22] so the prophet says the life of
[40:25] Abraham is a exactly the life of the
[40:28] Bride the Journey of Abraham is the
[40:31] Journey of the bride and he says the
[40:33] last sign that Abraham saw before the
[40:37] promised son came was God manifested In
[40:41] the Flesh was remember we're talking
[40:43] about prophets being signs right now the
[40:47] prophet is is showing you that we as the
[40:51] Gentiles this is our last sign right so
[40:55] the the coming of the prophet
[40:58] is a last sign unto Abraham is the last
[41:02] sign unto the Gentiles that God was
[41:05] manifested in a man not that the man was
[41:08] God no but the man was revealing
[41:11] God it's a very fine line amen
[41:15] amen not to say we worship a man no we
[41:18] don't right but God used the man just
[41:21] like God would use Isaiah God would use
[41:24] would use Moses but here is a last sign
[41:28] because God was not going to come in the
[41:31] body of
[41:33] Flesh the only time we're going to meet
[41:35] him is we meet him in the air when he
[41:37] comes in in in the Rapture but before
[41:40] that he comes veiled in bener skins
[41:43] sometimes he comes behind your pastor
[41:44] when his ministry but we know that in a
[41:47] greater measure he came through the skin
[41:49] of a prophet and that Prophet was the
[41:53] last sign that the Gentile sign Gentile
[41:56] word is going to is going to see amen
[41:58] there is no other sign that is going to
[42:00] come there's no other great man that is
[42:03] going to come out of somewhere and start
[42:04] revealing that the prophet finished the
[42:08] mystery we are preaching not uh closed
[42:11] Mysteries but we are preaching revealed
[42:13] word because the prophet revealed the
[42:16] word amen now when we say the prophet
[42:18] revealed the word it doesn't mean that
[42:20] he came to answer every question that we
[42:23] have he came to give us what we need for
[42:26] the
[42:27] Rapture the message is not there to to
[42:30] answer every Bible question that ever
[42:34] existed that's a
[42:36] misconception the message came to answer
[42:39] the questions that you have for the
[42:41] Rapture amen God gives you what is
[42:44] sufficient for your journey am if you
[42:48] want to drive to North Carolina and you
[42:49] need 30 uh uh gallons of gas God will
[42:52] give you that right amen because he is
[42:55] Jehovah J he knows what is sufficient
[42:57] for you am so God will meet you based on
[43:01] your needs so if there is something that
[43:04] you need for the Rapture God has
[43:06] provided it in the message but the
[43:09] message is not a a a a a a AI or like a
[43:14] a Wikipedia where if you just think of a
[43:16] random question is going to is going to
[43:18] answer you no God will just give you
[43:21] enough faith for the next step that's
[43:25] right Abraham was given faith for his
[43:28] journey Joseph was given enough faith
[43:31] for his journey Daniel was given enough
[43:33] faith for his we have the faith laying
[43:36] in the books to take us in the
[43:39] Rapture those books did not come so that
[43:42] we can answer every Theologian on the
[43:44] internet no sir that's not what it was
[43:48] sent for this is the children's bread it
[43:51] was given to feed the flock it was given
[43:54] to feed the children so if you are sheep
[43:56] then God is giving you
[43:59] bread amen it's not to feed the whole
[44:01] world it's to feed his children
[44:05] amen amen and he says it was in the days
[44:09] of Sodom that God came down and was
[44:12] manifested in human flesh and told what
[44:14] Sarah was thinking back in your heart in
[44:15] the tent behind him the last sign before
[44:19] the Gentile world was destroyed by
[44:22] fire it's not some great politician
[44:25] coming on the scene no
[44:27] the prophet is a sign amen Revelations
[44:30] 1:1 I think we spoke about this now I
[44:34] want you now to put your antennas up
[44:37] buckle
[44:39] up amen cuz I'm wearing this so I feel
[44:41] like a
[44:42] pilot we're going to get into some some
[44:45] turbulance
[44:47] now now the prophet says now as soon as
[44:51] this church the bride is draw together
[44:54] she is taken up and that mystery of of
[44:57] the seventh seal of the seventh seal the
[44:59] mystery of going right he saying the
[45:01] mystery of going say some sometimes
[45:02] sometimes he call it the mystery of the
[45:03] coming of the Lord so when he says going
[45:06] it's us going sometimes he says the
[45:08] Myster of his coming it's him coming but
[45:10] it's the same
[45:12] thing and The Jewels is called by The
[45:15] Mystery of the seventh trumpet which is
[45:17] two prophets Elijah and Moses and they
[45:21] come back and there is where the
[45:23] Pentecost is all mixed up they are
[45:25] looking for something to happen happen
[45:28] the church is done gone I like the
[45:30] southern English at least now you people
[45:32] can understand when if I'm in Africa I
[45:34] have to explain what this means the
[45:35] church is done
[45:40] gone I done met the
[45:43] Lord now he says in Revelation 11 call
[45:49] their ministry will be the ministry of
[45:50] Moses and Elijah calling to Israel out
[45:52] of the Jewish Traditions so the seventh
[45:56] trumpet
[45:57] is prophets calling people out of Jewish
[46:01] Traditions I want you to understand that
[46:03] very important right just as the seventh
[46:06] Angel's message called The Bride out of
[46:09] the Pentecostal
[46:11] tradition so the the seventh trumpet is
[46:14] a parallel of the seventh seal amen you
[46:18] have a prophet here one Prophet but here
[46:20] you have two prophets so so so the
[46:24] seventh SE is the coming of the Lord
[46:26] because remember in Thessalonians it
[46:27] says the Lord himself shall descend
[46:31] personal pronoun the Lord himself shall
[46:34] descend in a voice in a shout in a
[46:37] trumpet and the prophet says he does
[46:40] those three things as he's descending
[46:42] but it's not in in our kind of way of
[46:44] thinking that is you going to see the
[46:47] you know Jesus of Nazareth coming down
[46:49] with you know G sleepers
[46:53] no he is being revealed by the ministry
[46:56] of the
[46:58] Prophet it's the same thing when Christ
[47:01] reveals himself to the
[47:03] Jews he's not going to show up and just
[47:06] say hey this is me no it's going to be
[47:09] revealed through the ministry of Moses
[47:11] and the Elijah and the reason why you
[47:13] have got millions and millions and
[47:15] millions of Jews and only 144,000
[47:19] believe it and receive the Holy Ghost is
[47:22] because it will be so unusual for the
[47:24] rest of them they waiting for the
[47:27] Messiah yes they they bombing everywhere
[47:29] they want to build a temple because they
[47:31] they think the Messiah is going to come
[47:32] in the temple and show up and everyone
[47:34] is going to say wow there's the Messiah
[47:37] no sir it's going to be a Ministry of
[47:40] two prophets and those that accept that
[47:43] Ministry are sealed and there the
[47:47] 144,000 it's the same thing again in our
[47:50] time is Gentiles amen when people think
[47:53] about the coming of the Lord the seventh
[47:55] see yes we shall see him face to face in
[47:57] the sky eventually him our Lord Jesus
[48:01] Christ but be before before we can go
[48:04] there we have to have a revelation and
[48:06] see him in the form of the Holy Ghost
[48:09] through the spoken word of Malachi 4
[48:13] amen so if you understand the seven the
[48:17] trumpets you understand the seals if you
[48:20] understand Moses and Elijah you
[48:21] understand our Prophet it says remember
[48:24] Moses and Elijah is to call Israel out
[48:26] of the old atonement of the lamb and
[48:30] sheep and blood and goats and sacrifice
[48:33] to the Real Living Sacrifice to the word
[48:36] so these people they're
[48:38] sacrificing they still believe in the
[48:40] old
[48:41] sacrifice so when Christ brings them to
[48:44] the atonement when when the true
[48:46] prophets it's not like he's taking them
[48:49] somewhere physical and show them no he's
[48:52] simply explaining to them the prophets
[48:55] that the C CR of Calvary was their
[48:59] atonement that's why the feast is called
[49:01] the Feast of morning right amen right
[49:05] let's put it on the
[49:06] screen amen I've got about 10 minutes
[49:08] left but that's okay so the Bible is
[49:11] based on the Harvest Right all the
[49:14] Jewish feast they were based on the
[49:16] Harvest Passover and live in bread there
[49:19] was some form of harvest happening so
[49:21] you have the spring feast and the four
[49:23] feasts right these four Feast that's
[49:25] when they harvest the grapes and prong
[49:27] grades and olives and we don't have time
[49:29] to get into that but the spring is when
[49:31] they harvest the grains the barley and
[49:34] the wheat and the different ones and the
[49:36] Bary was the first to ripen right and
[49:38] that's why you had the sh wave and
[49:40] everything because you could not do a
[49:41] fish without some Harvest because these
[49:44] things they represent the Harvest of
[49:47] Believers that's why we talk about
[49:49] perfection because Perfection is
[49:51] maturity because you can't be harvested
[49:54] unless you are mature amen
[49:57] amen can you say amen amen so first
[50:00] fruits or UNL bread or Passover that's
[50:03] why they the pass over here to consign
[50:06] to the ripening of the
[50:08] Bley that's why the seventh plug when
[50:10] God sent hell upon upon upon Egypt it
[50:13] says everything was destroyed but the B
[50:16] right was in the ear it wasn't destroyed
[50:19] because it was getting to about Harvest
[50:22] was soon after Passover you have unli
[50:24] bread and you have the shiv for you to
[50:27] have a shave wave you need to have the
[50:28] bread and you need to have the shave to
[50:31] wave before the
[50:32] Lord amen and of course the four you
[50:35] harest your grapes and your wine and
[50:37] some of it represents judgment right the
[50:39] wine represent different ones amen and
[50:40] some of it represents you know different
[50:42] things but we don't have time now this
[50:45] Feast we don't have time to go through
[50:46] them but the Feast of
[50:49] atonement it's not a
[50:52] killing because Christ dies
[50:55] once so Christ dies at the Passover at
[50:59] the cross right but the Jews they are
[51:03] CAU by the trumpets amen so that they
[51:05] can receive the atonement amen when they
[51:08] receive the atonement they enter into
[51:10] the Feast of Tabernacles which is the
[51:12] Millennium amen so when they are when
[51:14] the the atonement is not the killing of
[51:16] a lamp it's a Ministry that makes you
[51:19] realize hey your Passover happened back
[51:22] 2,000 years ago so Christ revealing him
[51:26] himself to Israel is the ministry of of
[51:29] the prophets when the prophets are
[51:31] preaching they are preaching the
[51:33] atonement so the message of the hour
[51:36] that's where you find your atonement
[51:38] when you go out of your denomination and
[51:40] you realize oh by the way this is the
[51:43] true atonement this is Jesus Christ
[51:45] that's how you receive your
[51:50] atonement it's not like the caral
[51:52] denominational way of thinking oh
[51:55] brother things are happening in Israel
[51:57] they're buying the ha first oh something
[51:59] great is happening no they will
[52:03] understand the true atonement and the
[52:06] Bible says that they will cry they will
[52:08] they will cry because why they realize
[52:11] oh it was Joseph that we sold because
[52:14] Joseph had to
[52:15] dismiss had to dismiss the bride so that
[52:19] he could review his himself to the
[52:21] brothers how did he reveal himself to
[52:24] the brothers he showed them the sign of
[52:27] circumcision and he could not do it in
[52:29] front of his bride he had to dismiss his
[52:31] bride and show his brothers I am a Jew
[52:35] this is my sign of
[52:37] circumcision and in the sixth month the
[52:39] angel Gabriel was sent from God unto see
[52:41] the city of Galilee named Nazareth to a
[52:44] virgin exposed to a man now why did God
[52:47] choose a virgin that was
[52:50] exposed not only exposed it was exposed
[52:55] to a man who was a weak
[52:57] M right and this little girl comes up
[53:00] and say I'm pregnant actually it was an
[53:02] angel that met me and got me
[53:05] pregnant yeah
[53:07] right by the way you are in courtship
[53:10] yeah who is your boyfriend well it's a
[53:12] man who's 40 years old you know his wife
[53:14] died okay so now you're saying you are
[53:16] pregnant by an Angel
[53:18] yeah if you are not elect you are not
[53:20] going to believe that that's
[53:22] right why did God choose such a comp
[53:26] licated process why didn't he just find
[53:28] an a virgin who was not exposed virgins
[53:32] they were there fasting and praying some
[53:34] of them children of
[53:37] Levites why didn't you choose that why
[53:40] why did did God do something that would
[53:43] raise
[53:45] questions why wasn't the prophet there
[53:47] when the cloud appeared why was he in
[53:49] Texas God does it to confound the wise
[53:54] amen it was the Lord's do and it is
[53:57] marvelous in our eyes right now it's
[54:00] easy for you to say ah of course of
[54:01] course the angel came to marry but he
[54:04] think about it if you were living in his
[54:06] time that's right right brother and a
[54:08] 16y old girl who just found a boyfriend
[54:11] who is 40
[54:13] years whose wife had died say I'm
[54:16] pregnant an angel met me and now I'm
[54:19] pregnant no precedence in the Bible
[54:24] whatsoever except one scripture and that
[54:27] one scripture is enough that's right
[54:30] amen and by the Bible says but God has
[54:33] chosen the foolish things of this world
[54:36] to confound the what this is why don't
[54:39] be too smart for the
[54:40] message it will go on top of you remain
[54:44] simple remain humble then God can reveal
[54:46] it to you
[54:48] amen amen now God he chose Moses a man
[54:53] who could not speak and he says you are
[54:55] the mouth
[54:57] piece you you take a man who cannot
[54:59] speak and you say you're the mouthpiece
[55:02] and Moses said unto the Lord oh my God I
[55:05] am not
[55:06] eloquent neither therefore nor since
[55:08] thou spoken unto thy servant but I am
[55:11] slow of speech and of a slow tongue and
[55:13] the Lord said unto him who ha made men's
[55:18] mouth or who maketh the dump or the
[55:21] blind you know what Moses kept arguing
[55:24] with the god with the Lord until the
[55:25] Bible says and God's was wroth with
[55:28] Moses and one time God wanted to kill
[55:32] Moses I think twice one that time and
[55:35] when he didn't circumcise his children
[55:37] because you know what Moses thought he
[55:39] could correct God you cannot correct
[55:43] God sometimes people think they can
[55:45] correct God and his choices God's choice
[55:49] is perfect amen you look at the baboon
[55:53] it's beautiful perfect that's the way
[55:55] God made it you look at the gator that's
[55:57] the way God made it everything God made
[56:01] them made it he said this is
[56:03] perfect Peter tried to do it each time
[56:06] he correct he tried to correct the word
[56:08] he found himself on the wrong side when
[56:11] the Lord would say I'm going to be
[56:12] arrested and the son of man is going to
[56:14] be killed and Peter says oh no no no no
[56:17] that's not going to
[56:19] happen right and God Jesus Christ said
[56:22] get behind me Satan because he was
[56:25] trying to correct the word
[56:27] word and the Lord said all of you are
[56:30] going to leave me and forsake me and I'm
[56:33] going to be alone and Peter thought he
[56:34] was smarter than the word says oh no I'm
[56:37] not going to leave you I I even go with
[56:39] you to
[56:40] jail and the Lord looked at him and said
[56:43] you especially
[56:44] you you the C is not going to three
[56:48] times until you deny me why because he
[56:52] was trying to be more holier than the
[56:55] word yeah on you are trying to be more
[56:57] righteous than the word stay with the
[56:59] word amen don't add don't subtract keep
[57:02] it the way it
[57:04] is in the Bible they used to make cakes
[57:07] that were called meal offerings if God
[57:09] said put 5 tablespoons of olive oil
[57:12] you'll put five tablespoons of olive oil
[57:14] amen if you put 10 then God is going to
[57:16] accept it n and Paul says we have this
[57:19] treasure in E and vessels that the
[57:21] Excellence of the power may be of God
[57:24] and not of us God chose Ean ver vessels
[57:29] he did not choose titanium vessels he
[57:32] did not choose golden well we have some
[57:35] golden verses is a type but he chose Ean
[57:38] that's that's dirt right that's that's
[57:40] the Bible word for for dirt right when I
[57:44] was in Africa I didn't understand why
[57:45] the prophet would say you have six feet
[57:47] of dirt because we we we we use the word
[57:51] sand or soil or we don't use dirt
[57:53] because For Us dirt but when I came here
[57:56] understood that you know the sand is
[57:58] what we called so the Bible here says
[58:01] the treasures is in Ean vessels right
[58:03] it's it's like in clay clay vessels so
[58:06] God would take the most precious things
[58:09] and he put them in vessels amen and I
[58:12] want to tell you something as I close
[58:14] amen the Bible this this what we call
[58:18] the holy
[58:19] Canon these books they were not always
[58:21] printed like this they were written in
[58:24] parchments and in Scrolls
[58:27] and they were
[58:28] lost and you know how they were found
[58:31] some some were discovered dead under
[58:33] under the Dead Sea right but a lot of
[58:35] some of them were found in caves they
[58:38] were found in clay
[58:41] pots so God was a genius to know that
[58:44] you can keep something inside clay and
[58:47] it can last for hundreds of years but
[58:50] but when God Did It people thought wow
[58:52] it's just clay but guess what that's go
[58:55] where God wanted to keep his word and
[58:58] God has put his word in these clay
[59:01] vessels you know we might be weak we
[59:04] might be brutal we might have our bad
[59:06] days we might have our our moments of
[59:09] temper but you know what God decided to
[59:11] put his word behind bener
[59:14] skins when God told Noah to build an ark
[59:18] he says go and find Goa wood and Goa
[59:21] wood is the one of the weakest Woods you
[59:24] can find it's very poor
[59:26] us and Noah did not ask God why are you
[59:31] making such a poor engineering
[59:33] decision just obeyed God and you and I
[59:37] are goer
[59:38] wood but if you if you then peit that
[59:41] goer wood with peach it becomes as hard
[59:44] as a rock amen without the peach of the
[59:47] Holy Ghost AM you are just vulnerable
[59:50] and poorest but it's when the Holy Ghost
[59:52] comes and Fs those those hes that you
[59:55] have then you become as hard as a rock
[59:58] and then nothing can move you then you
[1:00:00] can sing that song Jesus Is My Savior I
[1:00:03] shall not be moved I shall not be moved
[1:00:06] amen hallelujah do you love him tonight
[1:00:09] if the musicians can
[1:00:11] come God gave us a prophet amen and the
[1:00:15] prophet was the last sign and we being
[1:00:18] Gentiles we are also the last sign unto
[1:00:23] this
[1:00:24] generation and and the prophet did not
[1:00:27] understand his
[1:00:28] life and he he didn't understand what
[1:00:31] was happening to him and one time God
[1:00:34] said and then he went to the cave to
[1:00:37] pray and he met the Angel and the angel
[1:00:40] told him your peculiar birth and your
[1:00:44] misunderstood
[1:00:46] life was to take a gift so his life was
[1:00:51] connected to his gift his his birth his
[1:00:55] life
[1:00:56] was connected to his gift so it was not
[1:01:00] just only applicable to the prophet it
[1:01:02] was is also applicable to you right
[1:01:05] there are things that you may not
[1:01:07] understand there are things that you
[1:01:08] happen to you and you say why did this
[1:01:10] happen you know what God had a purpose
[1:01:12] for that God had a gift that he wanted
[1:01:17] to manifest in these last days that gift
[1:01:19] is in you it may not be preaching it
[1:01:22] could be singing maybe that's what gave
[1:01:25] you the inspiration to sing the way you
[1:01:27] sing it could be being a good mother it
[1:01:29] could be what you went through and you
[1:01:31] say you know what because of what I went
[1:01:32] through I want to be a good mother to my
[1:01:34] children God knew exactly what he was

[1:08:02] a category 5 at one time and it would
[1:08:04] have it would have just destroyed

[1:08:31] to what we already know in the Bible but
[1:08:33] it's got to come through a Ministry for
