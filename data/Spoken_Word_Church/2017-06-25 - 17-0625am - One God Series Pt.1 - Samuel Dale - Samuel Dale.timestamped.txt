[3:46] blessing you maybe see foolish in the
[3:51] word of the Lord
[3:52] okay second Corinthians 12 and John 1
[3:57] the only father we thank you for a time
[4:02] in an hour that we can set aside a
[4:04] little bit of our human element time as
[4:07] you sit down and rest a little bit and
[4:10] that you talk to us because that's what
[4:13] we desire more than anything else we
[4:16] know that we talk a lot we pray a lot to
[4:19] you but sometimes Lord we need to just
[4:22] sit down and listen to you talk to us so
[4:26] just have your way Lord in got each one
[4:28] of us forgive our sins remember the sick
[4:30] among us and just bless each one you
[4:33] promised it you said you sent your word
[4:35] and healed us and deliver us from
[4:37] destruction
[4:38] we thank you in Jesus name yeah I very
[4:42] maybe odd to scriptures to use but what
[4:48] we're going to do is start a series and
[4:52] it will be called a one God series
[4:55] because it will be many many messages in
[4:59] relation could I'm sure but we're going
[5:02] to start off in something that maybe you
[5:07] wouldn't cut it to together but hang on
[5:09] until we get to the end of it and just
[5:12] read the scripture okay now in 2nd
[5:16] Corinthians 12 it says it is not
[5:21] expedient for me doubtless to glory I
[5:23] will come to visions and revelations of
[5:26] the Lord okay watching he said I knew a
[5:28] man in Christ above fourteen years ago
[5:31] whether in the body I cannot tell or
[5:34] whether out of the body I cannot tell
[5:38] God knoweth such an one caught up in
[5:42] caught up to or now
[5:45] the third heaven now butter Brennan said
[5:49] that he was believed he went to the
[5:51] first heaven and he explains the first
[5:54] heaven later in the message as being the
[5:57] first heaven is the mote is the
[5:59] Millennium
[6:00] excuse me first heaven is now and the
[6:03] millennium is the first earth because it
[6:06] will come forth in a cleansing process
[6:08] but he said Paul went to the third
[6:11] heaven and what did Paul say then about
[6:12] this and I knew such a man whether in
[6:16] the body or out of the body I cannot
[6:17] tell
[6:18] God knoweth how that he was caught up
[6:21] into paradise and heard unspeakable
[6:24] words which is not lawful for a man to
[6:28] utter now he went through the third
[6:30] heaven so remember that as we going
[6:32] throughout the message now we go to John
[6:34] 1 says in the beginning was the word and
[6:38] Word was with God in the Word was God
[6:40] the same was in the beginning with God
[6:42] and all things were made by him and
[6:43] without him was not anything made that
[6:46] was made
[6:47] in him was life and the life was the
[6:49] light of men
[6:50] and lights on earth in darkness and the
[6:52] darkness comprehended it not now jump to
[6:54] verse 18 to pick up the salt we can go
[6:58] through all the other but you're going
[7:00] to see in a minute while we're going to
[7:01] be staying back before time look now it
[7:06] says no man has seen God at any time the
[7:11] only begotten Son which is in the bosom
[7:13] of the Father he hath declared him in
[7:17] other words the original says he has
[7:19] brought him out into the open or in
[7:24] other words he has revealed him I
[7:26] brought him out into the open where we
[7:28] can understand alright so you may be
[7:31] seated the Lord at his blessing to the
[7:33] reading of the word now I want to make a
[7:37] statement from this past Wednesday I
[7:40] went back and I said I said something
[7:42] and we were listening and I did I made a
[7:45] boo-boo I said I said in other words I
[7:49] said brother Branham didn't believe in
[7:51] baptism in the name of Lord Jesus Christ
[7:53] I was reading and quoting from that you
[7:57] can take Jehovah Jireh jour
[7:59] Rayford yoga Chris can you all of that
[8:01] but that's not his name
[8:02] and I meant to say Father Son and Holy
[8:06] Ghost is not his night but the way it
[8:08] came out just came out bluntly to say
[8:11] and will run around didn't believe in
[8:12] water baptism and name of the Lord Jesus
[8:14] that was incorrect because the Bible is
[8:16] correct but in case you heard that I am
[8:20] human to the point that I do make
[8:23] boo-boos and when I make boo-boos I want
[8:25] to correct boo-boos connection you know
[8:28] make sure it's right okay because we do
[8:31] believe in the baptism in the name of
[8:32] the Lord Jesus Christ if you know the
[8:34] Lord Jesus Christ does fulfil Father Son
[8:37] and Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ
[8:41] father son we go that's why it's in the
[8:44] Bible like it in okay alright now let's
[8:46] get started they said I want to start a
[8:50] series you know many messages in
[8:55] relation to our true understanding of
[8:59] one true and living God
[9:00] and I believe it's very valuable for us
[9:05] to understand what to mean now that is
[9:08] the Bible to understand one true Living
[9:11] God is the full Bible all the rest of it
[9:14] is in relation to it if you ask me to
[9:16] say brother Dale could you sum up the
[9:19] Bible with one talk I'd say one God you
[9:25] know I mean if you say what would be
[9:26] your greatest talk to connect together
[9:29] everything in the Bible it would be
[9:32] simply to say to understand one true and
[9:34] living God because that is what we're
[9:38] supposed to be understanding and without
[9:40] understanding that that's where it's got
[9:42] all messed up down through time during
[9:44] the dark ages they took away the
[9:46] understanding from the true Church of
[9:49] that one God and they came out with a
[9:51] Trinitarian concept well there's no such
[9:54] thing in the Bible there's not the word
[9:56] Trinity is not in the word all right
[9:58] let's see then to understand is to
[10:02] understand one true and living God all
[10:05] right now I know immediately your mind
[10:08] goes I start talking and that's why
[10:12] we've run to 18 the verse 18 we'll pick
[10:15] it up in a minute but see you'll say
[10:18] well no man has seen God at any time
[10:23] well that's got its truth but it's not
[10:28] all true because the same Bible says you
[10:36] know no man seen God in the same Bible
[10:39] said God is revealing himself to you and
[10:43] I what's the purpose alright see then we
[10:47] say God is the spirit that's true we
[10:52] believe that but just remember as we go
[10:55] along you'll pick up some things I hope
[10:59] because you'll understand that God is
[11:02] the spirit yes but then we're going to
[11:06] talk about him being not just a spirit
[11:10] as floating around you know we say
[11:14] spirit it's just something it really to
[11:18] our thinking a lot of times when we say
[11:19] spirit we just mean something that's
[11:22] motivating us something motivating me to
[11:25] do good
[11:26] something's motivating me to do bad we
[11:28] make that just spirit
[11:31] no things are all right you know
[11:35] understanding but remember now the
[11:38] Prophet we'll get to it later in making
[11:40] a statement and you were to understand
[11:42] this statement easily if God is just a
[11:45] spirit and our mental mind things then
[11:49] why do you pray for the Holy Spirit
[11:52] why do you pray for God to come and live
[11:54] in you because if he's just the spirit
[11:56] he's everywhere if he's ever heard then
[12:04] why would you ask God to give you
[12:07] eternal life it would be in you but it
[12:12] would be in the animals it would be in
[12:14] the trees they'd be no need of praying
[12:18] for the Holy Ghost if the Holy Ghost is
[12:20] just everywhere
[12:22] and this the spirit
[12:24] see that's why mankind came up with a
[12:26] part that they'll say you know that God
[12:29] is just your good touch but the devil is
[12:34] your bad dollars.the and that doesn't
[12:38] make anything real I'm the point I'm
[12:40] making we're going to we know how I do
[12:42] it I put a title and then I put a
[12:44] subtitle to what I'm thinking about so
[12:46] we're talking about understanding one
[12:49] true and living God but I want to ask
[12:52] you a simple question
[12:54] how real is your God I don't care you
[13:01] want to call him Buddha Hindu this out
[13:03] of the other father son Holy Ghost
[13:04] whatever whatever you want to be you
[13:06] doesn't matter if you want to be
[13:07] Trinitarian you want to be how real is
[13:09] your God that's a simple question to ask
[13:15] how real is your God is it possible to
[13:26] see God is it possible to understand him
[13:36] is it possible that he could speak to
[13:40] you how real is your God now I want to
[13:47] thought in your mind as we go along to
[13:49] think like this if we're looking at
[13:55] something real like would make this was
[13:58] made into this pulpit you know or
[14:01] papered or whatever you want rags it was
[14:03] made into paper just remember if that's
[14:09] tangible or real then are you going to
[14:15] tell me that your God is not more real
[14:17] than that well you just the spirit
[14:29] I thought we believed this we believed
[14:33] in one true and living God that Jesus
[14:34] was that God even if you're a second
[14:38] person of the Trinity you're gonna
[14:40] believe he's real in a horde of minion
[14:44] how real is your God well because I've
[14:51] been accused of trying to make him so
[14:53] real until people who say you're kind of
[14:55] doing away with God how could you make
[14:59] him more real in other words just was
[15:02] made out of rags maybe the paper
[15:06] whatever created dad or brought it into
[15:08] being is more real than this
[15:11] would you agree so then if there is a
[15:14] world and there is a life and there is
[15:16] people and that we're living then it
[15:19] means that somewhere at some time God
[15:25] had to bring into reality or tangibility
[15:30] or whatever you want to call it this
[15:34] world and people and he's more real yeah
[15:41] he's more real than that already to get
[15:44] to point to you when we start off then
[15:48] if Paul was taken up into the third
[15:50] heaven and that's according to the
[15:52] scripture he said he was you know he
[15:55] says I know a man you know now we know
[15:58] that was Paul always went up but he said
[16:01] whether I was in body or out of body I
[16:04] don't know we said I did go darn see
[16:08] something but he said I can't even talk
[16:12] to you about what I seen like a third
[16:17] heaven then that would mean there has to
[16:20] be others we live in life light matter
[16:23] like a fourth dimensional part than his
[16:25] TV you know different things are all in
[16:28] the next dimension and then the fifth in
[16:31] the sixth or seventh or and we talk
[16:35] about heaven we read over a revelation
[16:39] of heaven in dice
[16:42] and it tells what's going on there but I
[16:48] ask you the question is your God real
[16:51] and is your heaven real or is it just
[16:56] above us you know that you can call
[16:59] heaven just another atmosphere you know
[17:03] can be called heaven how real is your
[17:06] God and what would be his dwelling place
[17:17] well you just you just you just getting
[17:22] it too far I'm getting it too far for
[17:27] you to realize with your natural brain
[17:29] what I'm saying because with your
[17:33] natural brain you are limited
[17:35] you're taught you're taught of
[17:39] limitation you're taught things that you
[17:43] know you're not taught that God is real
[17:49] you're just Tony's the spirit see that's
[17:54] why they couldn't accept Jesus Christ
[17:56] when he came was he Almighty God in
[18:02] human flesh but why couldn't they
[18:06] believe it
[18:10] it was just a little bit too much real
[18:13] and what did they say
[18:16] did you're a man making yourself God is
[18:21] that scripture reading Matthew Mark Luke
[18:24] and John it emphatically States and
[18:27] declared how real God is the Bible said
[18:32] our eyes have seen him Peter said I mean
[18:37] Jesus said if you've seen me he said
[18:41] you've seen the father
[18:44] well that just means you know the
[18:47] actions and reactions of what's taking
[18:50] place that wouldn't want to say it
[18:54] that's your philosophy he said I my
[19:00] father are one
[19:06] who was it Philip one to love in one day
[19:08] said shorts her father is suffice mister
[19:12] he said have I been so long with you see
[19:18] they killed him because he being a man
[19:25] declared himself to be God the same
[19:29] people that was looking for a human
[19:35] being to come
[19:36] a messiah to fulfil Isaiah virgin shall
[19:41] conceive on they were looking for that
[19:46] one to kill him when he had every
[19:48] manifestation to show that he was God
[19:54] because you didn't come their way and
[20:01] would you uh he said well they just
[20:05] don't understand the spirit let's get a
[20:07] little strong thought about a spirit I
[20:13] wonder sometimes how we would feel if we
[20:18] had of actually stood in the presence of
[20:22] the Lord Jesus Christ what I know him
[20:28] because I feel a good spirit come on
[20:36] when I know he's God could I feel the
[20:38] good spirit where he stood in the
[20:43] president's and some of you did a
[20:45] brother on him he I feel a good spirit
[20:55] what about those who stood around him
[20:57] and didn't feel a good spirit because he
[21:00] said then spirits is hanging around all
[21:02] the time could it be that when you was
[21:05] in his presence that you might feel them
[21:07] bad parks so then we're just taking our
[21:14] philosophies of our mind and trying to
[21:17] make some theory of a God how would you
[21:25] go along with these statements that will
[21:27] try to prove that God is real not a myth
[21:34] a being a person what about now see I
[21:46] get accused of being soul you so confuse
[21:50] us by what you're saying you listen to
[21:52] what I'm saying is your God real enough
[21:56] who you can think about him being a
[21:57] being instead of just the mythologies or
[22:00] ideas or some drawers loose ideas that
[22:03] you know they say that the Lightning is
[22:05] going to splitting rolling bowling balls
[22:08] up through the heavens you know in a
[22:09] blue moon is that the mythologies that
[22:12] we believe in what about knowing your
[22:23] God's name one of God's God God is an
[22:29] object of worship
[22:31] what is your God what about knowing his
[22:38] name
[22:45] what about being able to see him
[22:58] the God I talked about how real and I
[23:00] believe he is he was before all things
[23:05] and by him the Bible said all things
[23:08] consist
[23:10] he created all things who is real and we
[23:19] know his name is Jesus jesus said I come
[23:27] to my father's nothing ever son
[23:31] followers in the lineage of it father I
[23:33] mean ever son father's in the lineage of
[23:35] the father has to be the name of the
[23:37] Father and what about to declare that
[23:43] you've seen him that's where we're going
[23:50] okay now if we take a long time get
[23:53] tired don't worry about it let just
[23:55] coast along till we see what's going on
[23:58] try to follow the line all right now you
[24:02] cannot understand God by the carnal mind
[24:10] it's impossible to understand the
[24:13] supernatural with a natural mind that's
[24:17] why I read the scripture emphasized
[24:19] verse 18 says the son hath declared him
[24:25] he which literally means brought him out
[24:28] into the open revealed him made him
[24:33] known to mankind he said right there on
[24:37] earth making God known to mankind and
[24:42] they killed him though how real is your
[24:48] God is in one of these days you realize
[24:55] what I'm talking about you know what I
[25:00] say the Prophet I'll quote him because
[25:02] see I'm talking to people that claim to
[25:05] be following a message and that's why
[25:07] I'd use it a lot you know your prophet
[25:10] said it
[25:11] new meaning you claim to believe this
[25:16] man and he says the new bird is the
[25:26] person of Jesus Christ coming and living
[25:32] in you now do you believe that and just
[25:39] be careful because he I do say that he's
[25:40] born for that look see if you believe
[25:43] he's a person then you had to leave he's
[25:44] real you just you just lost all grounds
[25:47] you're going back to some spirit and
[25:50] some beings and some different so then
[25:52] lose all that and let's go if you
[25:56] believe he's a person a person's real
[25:58] and remember if he created you he feels
[26:03] more real you are see I know that when I
[26:10] speak I require for you to think well I
[26:14] thought that's what God gave you a brain
[26:15] fart I require for you to think over
[26:25] things one because I thought that was
[26:30] what we're supposed to be I thought
[26:37] according to the prophets message and
[26:40] the Bible that God has spent 6,000 years
[26:46] trying to reveal himself to mankind to
[26:53] his creation but because maybe you've
[27:00] never experienced things that others
[27:04] have it's very easy to kind of pull
[27:10] everything into your capability of
[27:13] thinking you probably said God allow
[27:18] some people to see things he said maybe
[27:22] not everybody
[27:24] but he said he gives it to them where
[27:26] they can tell others about it when how
[27:33] real is your God in other words how do
[27:43] you approach somebody to try to talk to
[27:46] them about God well you know yourself
[27:52] that most everybody says God sent a
[27:54] prophet if you don't believe that you're
[27:56] lost
[27:56] start with your denominations is dead
[27:59] and all these are right but what about
[28:08] just trying to talk to them about how
[28:12] real your God is well I don't believe it
[28:16] I the way I believe he's just a spirit
[28:18] it's floating around
[28:22] well how real is your God
[28:31] okay what about a statement that a
[28:40] prophet could make you makes a lot of
[28:44] statements that are sometimes really
[28:45] baffling to the human mind
[28:48] I'll give this an over and over and over
[28:51] a lot of times go ahead with number one
[28:53] and we'll just start if I go real slow
[28:56] trying to go through the quotes that
[28:58] you've already heard 29 times we're
[29:00] going to read 30 or maybe 31 okay
[29:04] because I thought that was what we were
[29:07] here to do I mean I didn't know we came
[29:09] to see each other now have a good time I
[29:11] thought we were together together to
[29:15] learn of God and you went to school and
[29:20] you said in the first grade and you said
[29:23] 1 plus 1 is 2
[29:27] you got in the second grade you just
[29:31] said 2 plus 2 is 4
[29:32] but you know what you still had to know
[29:35] 1 plus woman
[29:37] so Elementary let's say Elementary okay
[29:43] look what right around says on who is
[29:46] this Melchizedek he's go down to what
[29:52] we're online you read all the rest of it
[29:54] reason give it the Word was made flesh
[29:55] to dwell amongst we know who is talking
[29:57] about Saint John the first chapter and
[30:00] the first verse notice this is in the
[30:04] beginning but before the eternal how can
[30:16] anything be before the eternal if it's
[30:20] eternal that had to be before that's
[30:24] where you don't get eternity go just as
[30:26] far that way to go that way right I give
[30:32] that to make a talk to where you'll
[30:37] follow it in the beginning but before
[30:44] that you could ever comprehend anything
[30:47] whatsoever about an eternal God he
[30:54] already existed but there's nothing
[31:02] before the eternal there's a lot of
[31:05] eternity how far you want to go just
[31:10] like I said well ago see you don't
[31:12] realize it all said he went to the third
[31:18] heaven and many heavens are they
[31:28] well that's just we don't understand
[31:31] that and I know it cause you're trying
[31:33] to figure it out instead of just
[31:34] listening Souter just simply listening
[31:42] so when John is talking about in the
[31:48] beginning so when it says in the
[31:53] beginning that means a starting place
[31:56] right a starting place is in the
[32:01] beginning let's say there was no
[32:04] starting place with God so he was before
[32:08] the beginning any comprehension you can
[32:13] have of a start of anything that means
[32:16] the eternal was back before dark you
[32:23] don't think about God you don't ever
[32:25] just let your mind wander and they won't
[32:27] you know I mean here is your thoughts of
[32:37] God just some Spiritist something and
[32:45] then he comes down a little further then
[32:48] he becomes word then then he comes a
[32:51] little further and he becomes flash and
[32:53] then he takes own place and now he's got
[32:55] something it took four thousand years to
[33:00] bring him into flash a whole lot of word
[33:04] oh what a revealing a lot of God so how
[33:10] real is your God
[33:17] you
[33:21] so he said notice in the beginning was
[33:23] the word when time began it was word
[33:27] what before it was word it was attribute
[33:31] or thought then it was expressed in the
[33:36] beginning was the expression the word he
[33:39] said now again to where Melchizedek is
[33:40] because remember Mel Chadwick was
[33:42] Almighty God right see his first being
[33:46] was spirit watching God
[33:51] supernatural all right the great eternal
[33:57] second he began to form himself towards
[33:59] flesh in the theophany is called the
[34:04] word of Oddi
[34:05] this then is a state he was in when he
[34:07] met Abraham was called Melchizedek he
[34:09] was in the form of the often II know
[34:15] your prophet is covering the descending
[34:20] of God right are the comfort of God
[34:22] coming down into the basis of being able
[34:25] to be understood right so where was he
[34:31] before the world well we don't know well
[34:41] now we know for certainty that this
[34:44] dimension that we live in is life light
[34:47] and matter we know up above us is an
[34:50] atmosphere and that's called the heavens
[34:55] right we'll see then if you can go into
[35:01] the to the heavens then you got two more
[35:05] rims or whatever you call it dimensions
[35:10] to be able to be dealing with that are
[35:14] greater than all of these
[35:24] see we get in our mind and when we get
[35:27] down to a little later on in the message
[35:30] we'll talk about God dwelling along with
[35:32] his thoughts and and our mind
[35:34] immediately Falls to what who's the guy
[35:37] the thinker sitting down you know who
[35:42] Atlas is either through it you know he
[35:46] holds a world of he's nothing anyhow you
[35:49] know the story on talking about you got
[35:51] a picture of a guy sitting down thinking
[35:54] huh they saying it like everybody all
[35:58] right now that's what we think because
[36:03] that's the human wording but was he just
[36:09] not nothing intangibility what is the
[36:14] word I can use I don't know education
[36:17] what you know something tangible
[36:20] something real would be real before the
[36:24] world or was he just virgin what do you
[36:35] think about God did he exist before the
[36:42] world and the being as a person I was
[36:52] just floating spirit and we got a lot of
[37:02] scripture cover now we're going to get
[37:06] down into something but really about 20
[37:08] sermons later where when the morning
[37:10] stars sang together the sons of God
[37:12] shouted for joy that was up in heaven
[37:19] before anything come to earth according
[37:24] to the word according to your prophet so
[37:27] we've got a long ways to go with ain't
[37:28] just a short terminology as we're
[37:30] thinking things over
[37:33] so how real is your God
[37:36] remember our statement at least some of
[37:39] you should head here and agree to smile
[37:40] or look or whatever that God's got to be
[37:44] more real than anything we know of
[37:45] tangible right you got to be more real
[37:49] than this because he made this you got
[37:52] to be more real than this body cut he
[37:53] made it so what do you think about your
[37:58] God was he just a spirit there was
[38:04] nothing no I know Moloch you know no let
[38:10] me ask you a simple question where you
[38:12] think about was he in the third heaven
[38:14] Oh
[38:24] all winter do these two more heavens
[38:31] above where we are and Paul wet dire and
[38:36] so things it was not lawful
[38:40] just because chaltén know you want to go
[38:47] back get that scripture he saw things he
[38:52] saw something he said whether in body or
[38:59] out I don't know but he said I've been
[39:01] there how that was just a vision that
[39:05] was just a dream that was it
[39:06] that's what we're going to get to if a
[39:11] vision is fulfilled it's more real than
[39:15] the vision you can have a vision of
[39:20] seeing something that's a vision right
[39:24] you can have a vision of seeing
[39:26] something happen tomorrow except there's
[39:32] a storm coming to mark two o'clock now
[39:34] you can say I saw a vision well now
[39:38] which ones are more real you've seen it
[39:40] by vision are tomorrow when the storm
[39:44] comes
[39:46] see could it be that Paul went to the
[39:51] third heaven surely we want to think
[39:58] about that being an eternal place right
[40:03] and you remember when he started
[40:06] bringing us into into manifestation
[40:08] disarray all went through the third
[40:13] heaven so things were not even lawful to
[40:17] speak off what about having something
[40:20] that you carried for 30 40 years and you
[40:24] tried because now listen you want me
[40:27] quote somewhere you thank Paul out of 30
[40:30] 40 years holds not trying to explain
[40:33] what you saw if you don't I want to sell
[40:35] you some stock the Booker and Leeds let
[40:37] you fall off in the
[40:40] he said no no well let me explain it
[40:43] this way was not brother branham cold
[40:47] don't try to explain the first second
[40:51] and third pool especially when he said
[40:53] first and second and he spent his whole
[40:57] life trying to explain it
[41:02] you mean Paul so all of this was never
[41:06] said a word about it where did he get
[41:10] all of that great understanding Dirac
[41:13] the book of Hebrews about this great
[41:15] eternal God melt shattered it and saying
[41:19] even melted it was a man where did Paul
[41:25] get all of that from it being got it
[41:32] from what he saw in the third heaven God
[41:34] remember Moses was taken up right and he
[41:42] saw the things and come back to earth
[41:47] and built them according to what he saw
[41:53] right but we know that Moses in what he
[41:58] saw was really that he didn't see a
[42:02] building a temple he saw God and tried
[42:12] to build him as Enoch did into the stone
[42:17] those prophets saw God when they brought
[42:21] it to earth what could they say naman
[42:26] look at the right one with it where he
[42:28] saw chariots
[42:30] Jocelyn's in the streets running like
[42:33] lightning he saw Buicks and Oldsmobiles
[42:37] and Cadillacs running down the road the
[42:40] headlights on he said that's why your
[42:42] prophet said it and said running into
[42:46] each other but What did he say
[42:51] he called a Jarvis he did not know the
[42:54] word Ezekiel so fire falling out of
[42:59] heaven but he had no word of nuclear
[43:03] destruction or atom bomb
[43:09] are you listening Moses saw Jesus in the
[43:14] heaven but when he come back to earth he
[43:17] build a tabernacle and all of that
[43:21] Tabernacle you think we didn't go down
[43:23] with Lugar's time in Jews don't
[43:26] understand that Tabernacle and all that
[43:28] doing come over sisters and all we're
[43:31] going to have a wonderful time brothers
[43:32] sat down talked to them Jews tell them
[43:35] all about that temple because they don't
[43:37] know what it all means but around said
[43:40] them Jews could not understand them two
[43:42] loaves of bread we're going to have a
[43:48] millennium to talk to them about Jesus
[43:51] and that's just going to start it
[43:53] because then we're going to go into
[43:55] total eternity in the future home am i
[43:58] right
[43:59] is that something beyond our minds is
[44:04] that too deep to follow it's because you
[44:09] don't want to maybe your God's not real
[44:15] to you within I'd assume I would ask you
[44:18] to get a good experience of God
[44:26] somebody's experience yourself Amish
[44:29] clicking home for them and you tell me
[44:36] how all of that works
[44:39] you mean you tell me how that that cell
[44:42] phone just clicked and got a message for
[44:44] somebody in Western Siberia and they
[44:47] ain't no telephone line hooked up over
[44:49] that then you want to tell me they ain't
[44:54] no eternal God in the supernatural part
[45:00] you can't look at the things of life and
[45:03] see it
[45:04] realize how eternal God is and how
[45:07] really is something wrong with you but
[45:11] listen what about an eternal God
[45:20] this becomes a property it would say in
[45:23] the Bible would say that God is a spirit
[45:25] that's exactly right
[45:26] God is our spirit just as Ezekiel so far
[45:29] falling out of him but he didn't
[45:32] describe this like I've tried to tell
[45:33] you come on get it a little common sense
[45:34] about Bible terminologies and brother
[45:39] Brown and said we'll give it our guest
[45:41] me later buddy
[45:42] when it's gear whenever when he quoted
[45:45] John warning said in the beginning with
[45:47] our hymn that with him would with a
[45:48] layman Ella hem was that with him and
[45:50] hell a.m. we think he kind interpret
[45:54] something doesn't ring you know with no
[45:55] no he doesn't say that he said in the
[45:57] beginning with the word we're really
[46:00] smart it's so stupid
[46:04] until we can't understand the Eternity
[46:08] of God well where did God come from you
[46:21] know it's good old Baptist had an answer
[46:22] for that any of you in here no word the
[46:25] Bible says God come from they just said
[46:29] it Bible said God comes from teman a
[46:33] survival somebody get the scripture Horn
[46:36] God come from teman oh where's Damon if
[46:45] they ever get it up you'll find the word
[46:46] demon means right hand where did God
[46:54] come from the right hand not from a
[46:57] place demon that he existed he lived but
[47:01] he is the God of eternity and Jesus is
[47:06] his name
[47:11] looking at him as we're trying to
[47:12] understand him man and went crazy trying
[47:17] to figure the Word of God out you can't
[47:23] figure it out it's going to be revealed
[47:30] now back at the injury since God come
[47:34] from teman it means the right hand I
[47:39] thought we believed by my right hand he
[47:42] said I saved them how did he bring their
[47:44] children of it I he said by my right
[47:46] hand right hand means power and
[47:47] authority get it in simple terminologies
[47:52] rush to understand but we just hold out
[47:58] that God is the spirit and we don't
[48:04] understand but those are words to try to
[48:08] explain him but brother Dale you told
[48:16] luck sometimes that you think that Jesus
[48:19] existed back over there somewhere and he
[48:22] was real now what are you going to say
[48:32] I'm going to put it in your life let you
[48:34] think about if you say he was backyard
[48:36] or spirit then it's real okay that's all
[48:40] that I trapped you with your own
[48:42] thoughts so you say just the spirit that
[48:44] my spirit would be real right you let
[48:49] somebody get up and come running down
[48:51] through here and they're mad as a hornet
[48:53] and they're going but somebody with the
[48:56] fish what do you own call dad that's a
[49:00] spirit it's real isn't it notice
[49:03] somebody don't stop you gonna bop
[49:04] somebody say you're just carnal why not
[49:09] be carnal then but the carnal enough to
[49:14] understand if there is a reality of a
[49:18] living of a world if there's a reality
[49:21] of life if there's a reality of people
[49:23] if there's all of these things
[49:25] we see then you mean to tell me all
[49:27] these things are more real than the God
[49:29] that brought it into being why can't you
[49:35] believe as we would talk with Apollo why
[49:39] can't you believe that when Paul went to
[49:41] the third heaven according to my Bible
[49:47] you can read a lot about heaven over in
[49:49] the book of Revelation but what
[49:51] dimension is that you mean to tell me
[49:56] you don't think there's something higher
[49:58] than that remember a lot of the Book of
[50:05] Revelations and visions and done of
[50:07] what's taking place or what he is or
[50:09] what if it's what I don't understand you
[50:15] sound like you're trying to believe this
[50:17] God is real why not
[50:23] would be your reason they're not leaving
[50:25] is real is it you're afraid of it you're
[50:29] afraid of him becoming more real to you
[50:36] what you see Church we have the truth
[50:38] why can't we believe the truth we talk
[50:44] about a god that's infinite and the god
[50:47] that's all-knowing but just remember
[50:53] I'll read it to you if he's a being you
[50:56] can't make him on the present except for
[50:59] the fact that he's omniscient because if
[51:06] he's our being he's not everywhere I
[51:08] wasn't the one that made the statement
[51:11] terribly well ago the prophets when it
[51:13] said it he said if he's omniscient he's
[51:16] ever were and all of that he said why do
[51:19] you seek the Holy Ghost he said it would
[51:21] be in you church listeners we talk about
[51:28] God sent a prophet we all came through
[51:32] those days and times or spokes to hell
[51:36] but it was trying to get people to
[51:38] believe God said
[51:39] profit non-sena profit Godzilla profit
[51:41] glory well what about the message he
[51:44] brought I thought about him being a
[51:49] prophet and his purpose we coming was to
[51:52] bring God out in the open to you and I I
[52:00] thought as we were reading the other day
[52:02] that even Jesus the flesh was not trying
[52:05] to reveal himself we're trying to reveal
[52:10] the God that was inside of me what do we
[52:15] look at God as being real but we just
[52:23] look at him as some spirit sometimes we
[52:26] just don't know what formative we don't
[52:28] know what is it and we don't know what
[52:29] that in we've already established by the
[52:31] Bible that there's at least a third
[52:33] heaven and the heaven is a dwelling
[52:37] place and brother Branham says God is
[52:46] real and he's got a dwelling place he
[52:49] said is heaven
[52:58] get you comprehend them she just sees
[53:00] you she's gonna get you comprehend a
[53:02] little bit that before the world of
[53:05] anything that God was real and you lived
[53:14] in a place it was real evidently the
[53:18] Pala third heaven must have been real he
[53:22] sees all things he couldn't explains
[53:24] what he saw things that couldn't explain
[53:25] it was laying Dyer yeah but I don't
[53:31] understand you that what are you trying
[53:33] to do trying to get you to think about
[53:35] God being real I didn't intend to go
[53:41] this way within Asia John I'll get to it
[53:43] later don't worry about it we're gonna
[53:47] get down to work that your prophet saw
[53:52] Jesus but your prophet said Paul saw
[53:56] Jesus Abraham meant God many times with
[54:09] the life thing was he met Abraham and
[54:13] play
[54:13] I mean met God in flesh Abraham made him
[54:16] no charity which was God in human flesh
[54:24] and he dropped one on you I mentioned a
[54:27] little bit while ago to somebody hope
[54:29] they don't explain it to nobody too much
[54:31] what about brother branham seeing God in
[54:33] many ways but then finally seeing him
[54:35] because he started off saying he said
[54:37] I've seen him in visions because he said
[54:40] one day I'm going to see him in reality
[54:46] he saw me
[54:51] what about it what about this great one
[55:04] going to pull under one eye up we'll get
[55:06] started a little bit then we'll quit I
[55:09] would ask you to just if nothing else go
[55:14] home I'll go back and listen to the same
[55:16] message as I breathe to make sure that I
[55:19] saying my wordings right and I didn't
[55:23] know I had said that REM didn't believe
[55:26] in water baptism name of the Lord Jesus
[55:27] Christ I was so caught up in my thoughts
[55:30] until it was never even in my thought I
[55:32] didn't say it as far as me and
[55:33] understanding well I said you said Shawn
[55:35] Jonah well I guess the better listen to
[55:39] the tape I listened to the tape probably
[55:42] a lot of you didn't hear me saying it
[55:44] because you mind as you're supposed to
[55:47] be taking what I mean not what I say
[55:50] right it is okay let's go let's get a
[55:58] little start okay questions and answers
[56:01] on Genesis I ask you to listen to that
[56:03] message it's in 53 729 I ask you to
[56:09] listen to the message read the message
[56:11] Oh
[56:12] questions and answers on Genesis and
[56:15] you'll see all of the things of a
[56:19] prophet trying to explain in 53 1965 but
[56:24] in 53 explaining an eternal God like I
[56:31] said to you over and over it don't mean
[56:32] nothing to you none of the writers
[56:35] whatsoever Matthew Mark Luke and John
[56:37] were recording what Jesus said they talk
[56:39] of a mode of the Elijah to come they
[56:47] speak of the things you know that coming
[56:49] in in the Son of Man but they didn't
[56:53] understand it Paul in the greatest of
[56:56] all he didn't express it and brother
[57:00] Adam starts off in the
[57:02] like the third-best I remember I looked
[57:05] it up I know he started we got 47 if 49
[57:08] I think he started talking about short
[57:10] man that don't mean anything to you that
[57:19] means he was a prophet to me look let's
[57:25] take that scripture no man has seen the
[57:30] father at any time no man can see God in
[57:39] bodily form because God is not in bodily
[57:43] form is that any problem always just the
[57:50] spirit and hate inside by the way you're
[57:52] putting that in there
[57:53] what's the bodily form what's the fact
[57:57] of not being able to see the father what
[58:02] if it is that we haven't fully
[58:06] understood all of God what if there is a
[58:10] lot of things according to the Prophet
[58:13] we're to get a message of cheer down to
[58:15] the endless ages after this life is over
[58:17] are we going up to heaven and set and
[58:19] twiddle our thumbs
[58:21] now we're going to be hearing about God
[58:24] there's going to be some time we just
[58:26] get enough ear to be able to understand
[58:28] anything that is said dire no man has
[58:35] seen the father at any time now what
[58:41] about Moses song God is according to the
[58:49] Bible when he said Moses he said no you
[58:53] can't see my face
[59:00] are we going to heaven and have a place
[59:04] over here for the father and a place
[59:07] over here for the Sun and place over
[59:09] here is the Holy Ghost and we still well
[59:11] I know which ones we actually I didn't
[59:18] end all about the name all right
[59:22] I brought as much as I could when you
[59:27] get to heaven are you going to see a
[59:28] pillar of fire and a halo into this and
[59:30] then you don't see all different person
[59:32] are you going to see Jesus no we're just
[59:38] going to see a throne set nice but ain't
[59:40] nothing on it because no man can see the
[59:45] father
[59:48] well according to Jesus he said if
[59:50] you've seen me he said you seen the
[59:53] father all right now we got one to come
[59:56] to the throne and is that the book of
[59:59] Revelation that is according to verse
[1:00:02] chapter four in Revelation you sought
[1:00:05] find a throne and all about it ain't
[1:00:08] nobody on me go to chapter five you find
[1:00:12] a throne and one on the throne where'd
[1:00:16] he come from but run said he was back
[1:00:19] behind making intercession he says now
[1:00:24] as intercession and waning it he said he
[1:00:26] climbed up on the throne and sits down
[1:00:29] what does that meaning that's meaning in
[1:00:31] your mind in your mind you see it Hume
[1:00:37] do these things because we're not up
[1:00:40] there to see it that's look nobody seen
[1:00:46] God in bodily form human bodily form
[1:00:51] Melchizedek was your first but I can
[1:00:55] remember of a bodily form appearing to
[1:00:59] Abraham or any of them now that was a
[1:01:03] body created for the purpose of stepping
[1:01:07] into the Melchizedek could not die for
[1:01:11] your sin
[1:01:14] so it was a body he stepped in God
[1:01:16] stepped into and he stepped right back
[1:01:19] out of it but in Jesus he stepped into a
[1:01:23] body and a birth male Cheddar's it was a
[1:01:25] created full-grown man
[1:01:27] Jesus came as a birth a baby God in
[1:01:30] human flesh
[1:01:32] Jehovah were no teeth that's worth
[1:01:35] hurting and he growed up look God is not
[1:01:44] in bodily form God is a spirit now I
[1:01:47] know that's your own profit in the sign
[1:01:51] paragraph explain himself okay we got to
[1:01:55] explain over here in the mind you see
[1:01:56] guard it off and ain't nobody finally
[1:01:58] for they never gonna be no motley form
[1:01:59] of God God God is your spirit okay let's
[1:02:05] keep greed no man has seen the father
[1:02:06] but the only begotten of the father hath
[1:02:09] declared him 1 John the first John
[1:02:12] that's really John 1 whether it is in
[1:02:16] first John 2 yeah
[1:02:18] now but notice now there's nothing
[1:02:21] there's your space there's no light
[1:02:23] there's no dark there's no nothing
[1:02:26] it just seems nothing but in there is a
[1:02:29] great supernatural being Jehovah God now
[1:02:41] he's just routing from spirit to a great
[1:02:46] supernatural being yeah we take this up
[1:02:54] here that's the same thing we used to do
[1:02:56] acts 2:38 Matthew 28:19 we take what we
[1:03:00] wanted to that's the way the people is
[1:03:02] amazing I cooked I told you what the
[1:03:03] Prophet saying ever what about all he
[1:03:05] said what about but in there is a great
[1:03:10] supernatural being over God who covered
[1:03:13] all space in all places at all times
[1:03:15] he was the ever licensing from
[1:03:17] everlasting that's good is the beginning
[1:03:20] of the creation now how many of you
[1:03:23] remember what wrote around said
[1:03:26] he said in the beginning of the creation
[1:03:27] he said God was his first creation
[1:03:30] that's a quote I'll give it to you we
[1:03:35] got create yourself
[1:03:38] no he just stepped into another phone
[1:03:41] okay come on that's God can't you see
[1:03:44] nothing here nothing not a move or an
[1:03:47] item in the air
[1:03:48] nothing I knew I heard nothing yet God
[1:03:52] was there that was God now let's watch
[1:03:55] for a few minutes after a while no man
[1:03:57] has seen that now that's the father
[1:03:59] that's God the Father he's right back to
[1:04:02] where he's talking that you can't see
[1:04:07] God and no problem he has to bring
[1:04:13] something to earth or to our earthly
[1:04:16] understanding and when he does that one
[1:04:21] sitting on the throne you will never see
[1:04:24] that father because that father will be
[1:04:29] in human flesh called Jesus is that any
[1:04:33] problem is any trouble that you won't
[1:04:37] see you but he'll be there why because
[1:04:40] my Bible says prayer phrasing it will be
[1:04:46] glad to get it money that's one day the
[1:04:48] son ship's going to terminate that God
[1:04:51] may be all in all now come on that God
[1:04:58] may be all that's all of him but what
[1:05:00] about in all that's you and I as his
[1:05:03] children we could bring a lot more into
[1:05:05] this not just waves going with the
[1:05:09] redemptive part I'm trying to start from
[1:05:11] the beginning
[1:05:14] but think about it look what he says of
[1:05:20] the unveiling of God we'll get one or
[1:05:22] two and quit paragraph 82 the unveiling
[1:05:29] of God who is this great unseen person
[1:05:34] who is this that Abraham seen in visions
[1:05:38] right it's a lifestyle he was manifested
[1:05:41] in flesh
[1:05:42] now you talking about Jesus he talked
[1:05:45] about Melchizedek right before the Sun
[1:05:48] came not himself came to Abraham in the
[1:05:52] form of a man watching at the end time
[1:05:57] manifested he saw him in a little light
[1:06:00] one time he saw him in visions he heard
[1:06:03] his voice many revelations but just
[1:06:06] before the promised son came he saw him
[1:06:09] in the form of a man and talked to him
[1:06:12] and said he meeting great
[1:06:13] notice God Himself veiled in human flesh
[1:06:17] this is a part of his way this is the
[1:06:21] way that he manifests himself to us
[1:06:23] manifests the eternal world God Jehovah
[1:06:27] made flesh
[1:06:28] like in John 1 in the beginning was the
[1:06:30] word in the Word was with God and the in
[1:06:33] the beginning with Ella him and that all
[1:06:36] him was become the word and the word was
[1:06:39] hell ahem and the word was made out of
[1:06:41] him and the problem didn't it's the same
[1:06:45] thing just unfolding like the attribute
[1:06:50] see it is in God and attribute is your
[1:06:53] thought but in the beginning the eternal
[1:06:56] he wasn't even God he was the eternal
[1:06:58] he wasn't even God God is an object of
[1:07:00] worship or something see so he wasn't
[1:07:04] even that he was of him the eternal but
[1:07:08] in him was thoughts he wanted to become
[1:07:10] material and what did he do then he
[1:07:13] spoke a word and the word was
[1:07:14] materialized that's the whole picture
[1:07:17] from Genesis to Revelation it's nothing
[1:07:19] is nothing wrong in stela him
[1:07:21] materializing so he can be touched feel
[1:07:24] and in the millennium there adela him
[1:07:27] sitting on the throne that's right with
[1:07:29] all his subject around him that he
[1:07:32] predestinated before the foundation or
[1:07:35] what about it
[1:07:37] how real is your God
[1:07:46] we've been through this let's cover it
[1:07:48] or we won't have to worry about it we
[1:07:53] see mankind tried to once the Bible was
[1:07:57] written he's tried all the time to
[1:08:01] express that word that's why you have so
[1:08:04] many different translations and so many
[1:08:06] different interpretations and things to
[1:08:10] try to make it simple but to all have to
[1:08:14] go back to the beginning and start from
[1:08:19] the beginning so the best mankind can do
[1:08:24] was to call him el ahem
[1:08:28] because that word derived from
[1:08:33] understanding of the fact that he is
[1:08:37] self existing that God dwelt alone okay
[1:08:43] go ahead with this from number to the
[1:08:47] adoption 1960 like a little bit the
[1:08:51] other night or struck it in Genesis when
[1:08:53] God called his name Lord God it's in the
[1:08:56] word él ella ella hem which means a self
[1:08:59] existing one there was nothing else
[1:09:01] existing but him there was no iron lied
[1:09:04] there was no stars or in the world I
[1:09:06] don't know nothing else it was God and
[1:09:09] God alone self existing self existing
[1:09:22] the best word that could come up with
[1:09:25] would be to call himself existing what
[1:09:29] other word could mankind arrive to
[1:09:31] expression so they said self existing is
[1:09:41] LEM
[1:09:46] and if he self-existing existed alone
[1:09:50] and simple and that shouldn't need a big
[1:09:55] old hammer hua if you understand that if
[1:09:57] you get seven existing just long okay
[1:10:01] any problem with that in order to be
[1:10:04] sensible he dwelled alone will remember
[1:10:08] he dwells alone in our talks goes back
[1:10:17] see to just some spirit and all why
[1:10:22] can't you realize we will get back to
[1:10:28] this as we get on the further end but I
[1:10:31] really thoroughly enjoyed one time the
[1:10:33] passion play in Atlanta and they only
[1:10:37] use it one time a lot of you have been
[1:10:39] there been with us when we went and the
[1:10:43] one time you know in the Passion Play
[1:10:45] they would start at one year here the
[1:10:47] next time they didn't start at the same
[1:10:48] place they started another period of
[1:10:50] time one would start at the baby one
[1:10:53] would start there and this one they
[1:10:55] started before the world begun and when
[1:11:02] its scene opened and the stage opened
[1:11:04] the first time was a man there were no
[1:11:12] stars no world on this a man the scene
[1:11:18] change from him saying let there be
[1:11:20] let there be in the world started coming
[1:11:22] into being this one that was standing
[1:11:25] there was saying it I rejoiced because
[1:11:29] it witness report missus spirit I tried
[1:11:33] with this next scene you heard a baby
[1:11:39] crying the next scene he was about 30
[1:11:49] and he walks out and when he walks out
[1:11:53] they called it but they said they
[1:11:57] couldn't use it no more they were not
[1:11:59] allowed to use that because it was
[1:12:01] copyrighted they were never used to use
[1:12:06] that again
[1:12:07] because when this man stepped out at 30
[1:12:10] he was the same man playing the part of
[1:12:14] the God that created the world why not
[1:12:24] you mean Jesus don't look like God we
[1:12:29] spent our time talking about him being
[1:12:30] God but you mean Jesus don't look like
[1:12:32] God well I just said to everyone and
[1:12:35] we're what God looks like he's like
[1:12:36] Jesus shows it because he declared that
[1:12:39] he brings it out I said to rejoiced
[1:12:43] because I knew that's what happened
[1:12:47] the very man according to my Bible
[1:12:51] according to my Bible in John 1 Hebrews
[1:12:54] 1 Colossians 1 James 3 and 9 the lie
[1:13:00] many more scripture says Jesus Christ
[1:13:02] created all things and there was not
[1:13:06] anything made unless he made it read all
[1:13:10] those scriptures especially in James I
[1:13:13] think it's 3:00 at 9:00 well why
[1:13:16] wouldn't you believe I rejoice because
[1:13:20] here was the creator when he came in
[1:13:24] human flesh that's what he looked the
[1:13:29] man played in the park what do you think
[1:13:33] Jesus looks like he looks like God
[1:13:37] because He is God
[1:13:38] what do you think well I guess God is
[1:13:42] just a glog vocal whining Jesus applause
[1:13:48] you don't think do you
[1:13:54] if God is just in lavaridge Spirit and
[1:13:58] Jesus couldn't have been nothing else
[1:14:02] but that then he could turn to Philip
[1:14:06] and say you look which one word he says
[1:14:10] you've seen me you've seen my father
[1:14:15] Cobra one stanka local musician I meant
[1:14:22] to get a long ways and I thought over
[1:14:23] I've been on this and then we had
[1:14:27] everything ready to get don't worry
[1:14:32] about it we could only we instead start
[1:14:34] I just asked you a simple question
[1:14:41] how real is your God and if Jesus was
[1:14:47] right it you've seen me you've seen the
[1:14:48] father then who does a father look like
[1:14:50] I thought your son was supposed to look
[1:14:55] like a father right I mean that's always
[1:15:01] what it is we then it hunting Lynn
[1:15:04] yesterday and talking to the guy and
[1:15:06] he's met Wade and they were painting it
[1:15:09] dirty was Hector here he said something
[1:15:13] I said something talking to him he said
[1:15:16] he said tell your daddy
[1:15:19] we're rich without life and he said tell
[1:15:24] your daddy I said hey that's it mr.
[1:15:31] Edward I am the dead he said be sure
[1:15:37] like y'all yeah I thought Jesus was
[1:15:45] supposed to look like his father
[1:15:47] what would you ever expect the father to
[1:15:49] be or how to look what went down here's
[1:15:54] where we go see we've never none of us
[1:15:57] didn't see Jesus and Hoffman laid a
[1:16:02] picture in 1889 I think I try
[1:16:07] when he painted the rich young ruler
[1:16:09] Stan well I don't nobody know what Jesus
[1:16:14] looked like well you know he looked like
[1:16:16] somebody right why would your prophet
[1:16:25] say he said I've never been without
[1:16:29] since I've seen it a picture of Hoffman
[1:16:33] in my home now you're just 30 years 33
[1:16:37] so don't get confused he'll say 30 he'll
[1:16:40] say 33 don't get confused I got them all
[1:16:43] written down he said I've never been
[1:16:46] without a picture of Hoffman he's
[1:16:51] because that's the closest well then
[1:16:55] what does Jesus look like the closest
[1:16:57] you can get to Hoffman then what does
[1:16:59] God look like the closest you could get
[1:17:02] to Jesus right around him talk so much
[1:17:10] of it I'll give you the quote he said
[1:17:12] before men I leave to go on a trip we
[1:17:16] leave to go out something he said me and
[1:17:19] my wife and kids
[1:17:21] he said we go and stand before the
[1:17:26] picture of Hoffman and pray it he told
[1:17:32] us not to do those time you don't have
[1:17:34] to have a picture to remind you of this
[1:17:36] out of the other but that's his honesty
[1:17:38] of what he believed I know the story
[1:17:44] Hoffman there's a 34:33 there's no proof
[1:17:47] of this that or the other about it
[1:17:49] because you can argue about all you want
[1:17:51] to but just remember somebody painted a
[1:17:53] thirty and somebody planted a 33 then
[1:17:55] you argue over Hoffman didn't do this
[1:17:57] and Hoffman didn't do that what's your
[1:17:59] argument you got two pictures that's why
[1:18:02] they're back here behind you look at the
[1:18:05] young man and then you look at the older
[1:18:09] man and I'm in between them and that's
[1:18:12] what caused him to look like that I
[1:18:14] don't care who painted that one and who
[1:18:17] painted that one
[1:18:20] that's right it's just a fact of knowing
[1:18:24] my god is real
[1:18:26] go ahead brother holier that's 1962
[1:18:30] anybody have an aid the altars open I
[1:18:32] guess we do that trying to get you to
