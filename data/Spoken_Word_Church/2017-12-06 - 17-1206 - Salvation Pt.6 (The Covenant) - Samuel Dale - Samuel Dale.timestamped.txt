[2:59] been reading this in Genesis in Jonah
[3:05] but I will sacrifice unto thee with the
[3:07] voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that I
[3:10] have vowed salvation is of the Lord
[3:14] and the Lord spake and spake unto the
[3:17] fish and it vomited out Jonah upon the
[3:20] dry land alright let's go over code it's
[3:23] gonna take a little while to come back
[3:26] into this scripture for you to really
[3:29] see the connection but let's read it
[3:31] from Genesis 3 14 and verse 15 and the
[3:36] Lord God said unto the serpent because
[3:38] thou has done this dark cursed above all
[3:41] cattle and above every beast of the
[3:44] field and upon thy belly shalt thou go
[3:46] and dust shalt thou eat all the days
[3:48] with our life here's the main thing go
[3:51] see and I will put enmity between thee
[3:54] and the woman and between thy seed and
[3:57] her seed it shall bruise thy head and
[4:00] thou shalt bruise his heel okay you may
[4:03] be seated the Lord had his blessing to
[4:06] the reading of the word now we've been
[4:10] talking about in the Old Testament and
[4:15] talking about salvation
[4:18] alright deliverance the many different
[4:21] things and and the reason that I've
[4:23] chose to use it in the way that we're
[4:27] talking about it I want you to watch
[4:31] something - not very close we can talk
[4:36] about the Covenant that God made with
[4:39] Adam but now what can you say about the
[4:45] covenant with Noah it's going to be
[4:50] surprising in a minute when we come
[4:53] around to a point of trying to drive
[4:55] home something to you because to me it's
[4:57] very valuable to understand the Bible
[5:01] all right now remember this point that
[5:06] we're talking about salvation that it
[5:08] means deliverance you know alright it
[5:12] can have many many things that can be in
[5:16] relation to using the word of
[5:20] deliverance or salvation it doesn't
[5:25] always mean salvation for the Soul
[5:29] you can just mean a deliverance it can
[5:32] mean whatever is needed or a part or a
[5:35] thought for the time that is needed and
[5:39] it's called deliverance or called
[5:41] salvation
[5:43] you remember Moses stand still and see
[5:46] the salvation of the Lord in the Red Sea
[5:49] or the sea opened up you know and they
[5:52] went across and they're clothed back up
[5:53] on the people all right see it's not
[5:56] necessarily a thing of salvation of what
[6:00] we think about of the point of life and
[6:09] eternal life or something like that or
[6:12] whatever now but remember for a
[6:15] certainty they're thought as being all
[6:18] the way through that there was a
[6:21] salvation in the Old Testament right
[6:26] there was a deliverance of salvation in
[6:29] the Old Testament all right and to then
[6:33] it proved that to be true because there
[6:36] was a place for the the people when they
[6:38] died they could go to a place called
[6:41] Paradise and it would show that there
[6:43] was salvation deliverance but remember
[6:48] the point that we've tried to make over
[6:50] and over and I hope this will turn I to
[6:52] kind of drive that down a little to get
[6:55] our thoughts in line that you remember
[6:59] that there's no such thing in the Old
[7:02] Testament as a person receiving eternal
[7:04] life because Jesus Christ had not come
[7:13] and died all right he said well I've
[7:17] heard that and heard that heard that
[7:18] maybe one day it'll don't only that's
[7:20] true because you're still thinking that
[7:23] there is some kind of something that
[7:25] they had back there they could not have
[7:28] eternal life in their soul like that so
[7:33] they have to wait on you and I so
[7:35] Hebrews 11 tells us that the day without
[7:38] us cannot be made perfect all right
[7:41] not meaning they're not saved now not
[7:44] meaning there's not a place farm not
[7:46] meaning there's not a salvation no no
[7:51] way are we talking that but it was for
[7:55] their time in the doing because remember
[7:59] now what our thought will be taken
[8:01] around this point that the natural is a
[8:07] type of the spiritual no see then the
[8:12] Old Testament would be typing the New
[8:16] Testament but remember what you're doing
[8:19] when you're dealing with the top a top
[8:22] is not all the ways exactly to the
[8:26] specific point as your anta type will be
[8:32] right cuz it'll be a type of it it won't
[8:38] be totally in line our broad out exactly
[8:42] it'll type it you know you take a little
[8:45] log and uhyou out a canoe and then you
[8:50] take a big old ship well there's no
[8:55] comparison to what you've got right but
[9:00] it is the thought that it had its
[9:03] beginning or origin into that now
[9:07] remember this and watch our point keep
[9:09] this in mind there is no now watch my
[9:14] point now without watch this go hmmm no
[9:18] there is no form of salvation of eternal
[9:23] life in the Old Testament because Christ
[9:28] had not come yet to release the life
[9:30] that was within him right now but there
[9:35] is no salvation in the New Testament
[9:39] unless the Old Testaments right come on
[9:45] there's no salvation in the New
[9:47] Testament if the Old Testament is not
[9:50] right
[9:51] so we believe in know for sure T how
[9:54] perfect it is that's what I want you to
[9:57] watch tonight something I've studied all
[10:02] week or a few weeks about this message
[10:04] especially because knowing it was coming
[10:07] into view but I want you to think about
[10:10] something to not especially in the
[10:15] covenant with Noah where was there
[10:19] anything talking about salvation and
[10:22] Noah's covenant we're all natural come
[10:36] on do you understand what I'm saying
[10:41] all of that all of half of Adam's was
[10:45] natural all of noise was natural in hi
[10:49] for over hi of Abraham's covenant that
[10:54] we want to talk about unconditional and
[10:56] it's not of the other and think we
[10:58] really understand it's all about natural
[11:02] things but remember now the natural will
[11:10] type the spiritual the natural will type
[11:18] the spiritual our bring out into the
[11:21] open to show you what the spiritual will
[11:24] be so then you can see that truly there
[11:32] was a salvation back there he brought
[11:35] those people to a place and anchored
[11:38] them and gave them a position that they
[11:41] could have life but it would have to
[11:46] wait for a time because it would not be
[11:51] back there in the manifestation at that
[11:54] time so now it's going to require for
[11:59] you to think a little bit tonight
[12:03] and get into your mind what we're
[12:05] talking about and then you'll see the
[12:07] natural types of spiritual you see
[12:13] justification sanctification the baptism
[12:17] of the holy ghost spoke of back dark
[12:21] coming through the Word of God right now
[12:27] that's that's the point because that's
[12:29] what I want you to see you so what do we
[12:32] need to know we just need to know about
[12:33] justice a way back in Laura what happens
[12:36] to justification what happens is
[12:40] sanctification what happens with the
[12:43] baptism when the Holy Ghost rather than
[12:48] that was very amazed when we wrote out
[12:50] just a little simple point for us here
[12:53] of talking about the new birth into him
[12:59] you could just see that it just it's
[13:01] just you know he'd never thought of it
[13:07] see that the baptism of the holy ghost
[13:10] you can have it every day your life the
[13:13] Prophet said and die and go to hell then
[13:22] we know see that's what I said to us
[13:23] it's things we talk about all the time
[13:26] then we know that the anointing is on
[13:29] your spirit but that was the point I
[13:32] asked the brother or thought I related
[13:35] in relation to him that that that has
[13:42] taken place has to be in the Word of God
[13:48] Jesus planted the word and the word
[13:51] could be made alive
[13:52] darzee Newburg but see we all of our
[13:56] life had it the baptism right what is
[14:04] the new birth some baptism of the Holy
[14:06] Ghost we you know that's right that's
[14:11] right but then it can be wrong according
[14:14] to where the anointing that
[14:18] that's what I say you say do we need to
[14:22] know these things well we're still here
[14:28] for some reason now I'm just gonna be
[14:30] that way with you we're still here 50
[14:32] something years after the going of the
[14:34] Prophet so there must be some reason
[14:37] we'll all of these hoop laws and and
[14:39] things that they've come up with the new
[14:41] doctrines and ideas and all of these
[14:43] silk you know that was it when we heard
[14:50] that work we're him the great doctor and
[14:54] what Ham had relationship with with even
[14:58] had Cana was that the way it come out or
[15:00] something
[15:02] Noah's why uh yeah that ham had a
[15:07] relationship with his own mother in the
[15:09] brought forth Cana boy would just I mean
[15:12] it's just a for real just you know go
[15:18] ahead yeah give me a piece of ice and I
[15:22] can bring you a 302
[15:23] you know right not making no joke
[15:28] telling the truth all right now let's
[15:32] get to the thought so then if we can see
[15:35] justification sanctification the baptism
[15:39] of the holy ghost in the covenants that
[15:43] was made God remember there were three
[15:46] covenants made right remember that the
[15:49] prophet of God said it own the message
[15:52] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[15:53] and forever 1962
[15:56] it's recoving this one with Adam one
[16:03] wouldn't know well and one with Abraham
[16:07] all right now so if you're going to come
[16:11] to the new birth you're gonna have to
[16:12] come through justification
[16:14] sanctification and the baptism of the
[16:17] Holy Ghost through the Covenant of Adam
[16:22] the covenant of Noah and the covenant of
[16:26] abraham and it's so amazing that is
[16:29] right in the world
[16:30] if you just read and think about it but
[16:36] read it as I said very carefully
[16:39] remember there was two covenants made on
[16:43] condition that was with Adam and Noah
[16:52] would I ask you again
[16:54] would you mind in some way relating to
[16:58] me the covenant with Noah didn't get a
[17:06] little bit with Adam but what about Noah
[17:08] uh-huh
[17:10] he didn't think about it think about
[17:16] what I'm trying to get out we say we
[17:18] know all about this but we can't put it
[17:21] in the word well then I thought if we
[17:26] couldn't put it in word I didn't think
[17:27] we're supposed to have very much to do
[17:29] with it you know I mean all right now
[17:36] think about it Adam's covenant was made
[17:42] and what was the covenant now we've been
[17:47] through this we had to take a little bit
[17:49] with Adam to background to understand
[17:52] what was the covenant with Adam well
[17:58] what's the covenant with Adam you don't
[18:06] partake of the tree of knowledge of good
[18:11] and evil that's all you can read it's
[18:14] not a covenant like a covenant that
[18:17] something is written out that Adam
[18:20] signed and agreed with so we look at it
[18:28] as those type of things and and that's
[18:30] why we're not understanding the Bible
[18:35] Adams covenant was own condition you
[18:39] remember what we brought out his own
[18:41] condition because it was placed too
[18:44] than a free moral agency allowing a
[18:48] person to make a choice and when they
[18:51] made the choice the choice went wrong
[18:53] and that was the only conditions you
[18:57] find you don't find any conditions
[19:00] written to Adam
[19:01] show me the conditions show me something
[19:04] Adam wasn't supposed to do or was
[19:06] supposed what he was to do or what he
[19:08] wasn't supposed to do there's only one
[19:11] thought he wasn't supposed to take
[19:14] that's great
[19:15] now that was where I hope you caught the
[19:18] point what I'm talking about that even
[19:20] till today from that day to where we are
[19:23] today
[19:23] that point our covenant if you want to
[19:26] call it then he made with Adam is still
[19:30] here today
[19:30] because we're still eating of the tree
[19:33] of knowledge and we're still dying
[19:38] the reason we're dying is we're eating
[19:40] of that tree but brother Dale I've got
[19:43] eaten to that tree and we should go back
[19:47] and listen to the messages to save me
[19:50] the time to have to preach do you say
[19:57] but he made a covenant with Adam what
[20:00] was the Covenant just don't eat and do
[20:09] you realize when Adam had now we've been
[20:12] through this right according to
[20:15] blasphemous names your prophet explains
[20:18] that Adam God breathed in this to his
[20:21] nostrils eternal life well I don't know
[20:26] where I believe it or not you just took
[20:29] a bite out for the wrong tree do you
[20:33] understand what I'm trying to illustrate
[20:35] like you and that dog you just took a
[20:38] bite off the tree and you died because
[20:46] you're denying the Prophet and you died
[20:51] that's what we're still Dinah don't know
[20:53] it cuz we're still eating a lot of
[20:57] we don't know the true
[20:58] what it is to take one word contrary to
[21:06] God's Word is the tree of knowledge of
[21:09] good and evil but look what started with
[21:15] Adam now let's get to thought his soul
[21:20] is eternal his body was not it was a
[21:25] creation all right
[21:28] we know his spirit was an eternal okay
[21:31] then we know that what he done was he
[21:35] lost the right to the Tree of Life wage
[21:43] getting the new CEOs bringing out the
[21:44] folks you know so listen very carefully
[21:49] so when Adam / took of the tree of
[21:53] knowledge of good and evil he died and
[21:58] he didn't die physically
[22:00] he'll probably another several hundred
[22:02] years I don't know exactly what the
[22:04] number of years are related to that
[22:07] right and we know he didn't die in his
[22:14] soul because his soul was eternal okay
[22:20] but he lost the prophet said what the
[22:25] right to the Tree of Life the earth and
[22:33] all the physical things you look at Adam
[22:37] as he was there in the garden your
[22:40] prophet said and we know Adams body was
[22:43] in eternal because your prophet was
[22:45] saying what he said the tree of life was
[22:48] in the garden to remind Adam that his
[22:50] youth was being renewed you realize what
[22:53] would happen at Adams stayed in that
[22:55] condition they would have never been no
[22:59] old age that had never been no problems
[23:02] that had never been no troubles right if
[23:05] he stayed in that condition he had
[23:09] eternal life in his soul
[23:11] and his body was just everyday being
[23:16] renewed that's what your profits aDNA
[23:21] but when he lost that right to the tree
[23:26] the book went back his way to be getting
[23:29] to that book was not a king james
[23:34] version or Scofield or Thompson chain or
[23:42] it was the names of the redeemable are
[23:48] they regained let's put it that way
[23:49] coded by stands better all right now but
[23:54] listen to what I'm getting at so in Adam
[23:58] lost the claim Brett around said on the
[24:03] earth now are you listening do you know
[24:12] that when this earth was created your
[24:18] body was in this earth am i right I
[24:23] don't think we call for Mars or Venus
[24:25] you know you know I thought it I thought
[24:29] it was from year am i right now I'm just
[24:33] trying to break it simple so what
[24:36] happened when Adam ate of that tree of
[24:42] knowledge he walked away from the Tree
[24:45] of Life and went with the tree of
[24:49] knowledge
[24:49] he brought death upon all mankind are
[24:53] you with me he died himself physically
[24:59] physically separate over years later he
[25:02] died he died huh
[25:06] and everybody sent sins died the only
[25:11] one of that is Jesus Christ we're gonna
[25:14] wait a long time to get back to him
[25:15] bringing alright but now think about it
[25:19] Adam lost the right
[25:23] of the earth by losing the right of the
[25:27] earth and I just I've wrote this thing
[25:31] three times to try to explain it I'll
[25:35] just forget it and just talk to you Adam
[25:43] lost the right of this earth coming to a
[25:47] full redemption come on seals now it's
[25:54] so hard to stay away from that point
[25:56] because what did brethren talk about in
[25:58] the seals a redemption of all things
[26:02] your body was in the earth waiting to be
[26:11] brought forth but that didn't happen but
[26:15] did it stop the process your body
[26:18] finally came I don't believe you're
[26:23] living in a body today that you wouldn't
[26:26] lived in and did not benefit I kind of
[26:30] believe everything's in relation to that
[26:32] I think you know I don't think I'd have
[26:34] been eight foot tall and you know you
[26:37] know and everything else I I think it's
[26:40] all kind of like it is you know all
[26:43] right but listen to the point Adam don't
[26:51] eat of that tree then you'll remain in a
[26:56] beautiful perfect condition but he
[27:01] didn't so he broke the Covenant remember
[27:08] that covenant now I've emphasized that
[27:10] over and over and over that covenant
[27:12] with Adam is still right here today
[27:16] and we keep eatin of that tree of
[27:19] knowledge which is our own ideas and
[27:21] thoughts of God's Word contrary to his
[27:25] word being true we're still dying and
[27:28] we'll keep on dying until somebody comes
[27:32] to the basis that they can stand on the
[27:34] word by itself
[27:37] while we've been here 50 something years
[27:40] because we've took her own ideas and
[27:46] tried to make our own ways okay now so
[27:55] lock it out in and then hold it right
[27:57] here okay Adam
[28:01] you lost my body go to my body was in
[28:09] that earth okay now watch justification
[28:17] sanctification the baptism with all the
[28:19] ghosts as we go along okay follow her to
[28:22] the line okay maybe that's enough on
[28:27] Adam to hold a point you come to Noah
[28:32] Noah what is your part of Redemption
[28:38] what are you going to type and do what
[28:46] was the Covenant given to Noah
[28:56] what was the Covenant was a contract
[29:01] made a covenant
[29:11] I've got your scriptures laying out here
[29:13] so if you want them just raise your hand
[29:15] and we'll go but you ought to be able to
[29:17] at least go back and read the Bible you
[29:19] can find Noah in Genesis and read a
[29:20] little bit and you'll find out whether
[29:23] or not what I'm saying is true
[29:27] when you come to Noah
[29:31] what was the doozer don't news of Noah
[29:35] if you had to cover their own condition
[29:41] come on did you follow that minute ago
[29:46] what was the do's and don'ts - Adam no
[29:51] do's and don'ts
[29:53] it was just stay away from that tree so
[30:00] what was the do's and don'ts to know
[30:03] what you say brother Dale why do you do
[30:12] the way you do cuz you're just a smart
[30:15] aleck listen folks I may be a smart
[30:20] aleck but I ain't very smart the words
[30:23] are done quit a long time ago
[30:24] and forgot it but I can't what was the
[30:32] covenant with Noah
[30:40] he said no you build an ark there was
[30:50] his covenant you build an ark he said
[30:53] Noah remember it's got to be salvation
[30:54] now he's got to be salvation he's gotta
[30:57] have a deliverer it's form to it right
[30:59] and he said no and I'm quoting brother
[31:01] Branham if you want him he said Noah he
[31:05] said you get in that boat and you said I
[31:07] own that was his words you go get in
[31:15] that boat and you set him what was
[31:22] Noah's covenant what was he to do build
[31:24] an ark what was his don't do you got it
[31:37] it's do you know do's and don'ts you
[31:40] know what I mean a conditional covenant
[31:43] his do's and dont's his do was build an
[31:46] ark he's don't what was it what was he
[31:54] told not to do
[32:02] it was told don't you eat of that tree
[32:08] knowledge because this 2,000 years
[32:13] between Adam and Noah and man had died
[32:22] it's so wonderful my wife asked me the
[32:24] other day why is it that I'm not gonna
[32:27] preach on it I did before a little why
[32:30] is it that between Adam and Noah those
[32:34] people that's where Jesus had to go and
[32:36] preach to them to that group of people
[32:40] there were disobedient in the days of
[32:42] Noah before then why why did it
[32:48] specifically stayed there because there
[32:50] were no prophets there was no prophets
[32:55] he jumped from Adam that's why it's
[32:58] written so fast and it's blunt and iron
[33:00] dumped and forgot it
[33:01] there's no prophets until you come to
[33:07] Noah come on you got to start with Enoch
[33:11] we'll get that guys we got to stop that
[33:13] first because you know what he is but
[33:15] remember he's on the other side of the
[33:17] story
[33:18] there was no prophet Specter he said
[33:22] what does that mean that meant God had
[33:24] to be a judgment somewhere so when he
[33:26] went to hell he didn't go preach to all
[33:29] that were in prison he preached only to
[33:31] those from Adam to Noah to make a
[33:37] judgment to him that they would be
[33:40] condemned now you're back to the story
[33:45] Noah your do is to build the ark your
[33:51] don't is to either the tree of knowledge
[34:00] don't you visualize and see in a world
[34:06] that ISM now is it right the Bible said
[34:10] that it was the data no no it's nothing
[34:12] new Under the Sun what was he is and
[34:15] is that true and and in this world today
[34:18] just like was back then
[34:19] you know that they had a scientific
[34:22] society back tire right and wouldn't it
[34:28] be something you're up on the hillside
[34:30] showing along in the guy comes out he
[34:35] says uh he said how you got to do is
[34:38] just tell me what you want and he said
[34:40] I'll go get you all the material brain
[34:41] tell you and no it just keeps going
[34:48] along taking 120 years all in logs get
[34:56] everything right you're getting the
[34:58] point I hope you listening Noah says
[35:04] that's the tree because God says Noah
[35:08] don't listen to him what's gonna happen
[35:14] what they could build ain't gonna float
[35:21] what they could bill can't float of
[35:25] what's coming said you just build it the
[35:29] way I tell you to build verses do's and
[35:33] don'ts there's is covenant he said this
[35:39] he phone Salling he said when you get it
[35:46] through get all the animals like I told
[35:49] you case you just see the world and
[35:53] making light of him when they could
[35:55] build him anything they wanted to bill I
[35:57] mean that could have building my
[35:58] Titanic's Tim Evans sitting side by side
[36:03] cuz it were a society they were going as
[36:07] to interplanetary travel well I don't
[36:11] know where they're well okay that's one
[36:14] you can argue about but it wouldn't have
[36:17] bothered me I was in a Baptist Church
[36:19] and I remember that it wouldn't have
[36:21] bothered me when they first went to the
[36:23] moon if they'd have found spaceships up
[36:26] there it wouldn't have bothered me
[36:28] because
[36:29] you the Bible said as it was so is it
[36:31] now but you see don't you take none of
[36:40] what they've got you build that art the
[36:43] way I say build it you know what Noah
[36:49] done it was that a Deuce and dogs was
[36:54] that a covenant own condition what was
[36:56] the condition just don't eat of that
[37:01] tree do what I tell you what is
[37:11] justification
[37:17] you're supposed to be remembering that
[37:20] so Noah he builds an ark he gets
[37:27] everything ready he gets in the art and
[37:33] he sets down any weights and God comes
[37:38] forth and great flood comes and all of
[37:42] those things happen all right but when
[37:48] it was finished is really when God made
[37:53] the covenant because when the art and
[37:58] everything was done and it floated and
[38:01] they come back down to earth remember
[38:03] the first thing Noah done offered an
[38:06] offering come from Adam they come down
[38:11] offering offerings right know offered an
[38:16] offering God I'm looking to scripture
[38:18] and God smelled the Lord smelled a sweet
[38:21] savior Genesis 8 and 21 he smelled that
[38:29] sacrifice that was made and he says and
[38:36] I'm paraphrasing right around and he
[38:38] simply says you know I'm sorry
[38:43] that I've destroyed all the world
[38:50] because of mankind and their sin he's
[38:54] not had to destroy it now let's back up
[38:59] to Adam Adam because of what you've done
[39:08] you'll make your living by the sweat of
[39:10] your brow in cursing Eve with all she
[39:16] done and everything put her under the
[39:18] point of a woman never cursed her I'm
[39:22] quoting her to random he said he cursed
[39:27] the earth okay and remember salvation is
[39:35] deliverance okay with Noah can you see
[39:40] what happened God wash the earth he
[39:48] cleansed it of all of the garbage
[39:50] they ain't a thing left all of its down
[39:53] in the holes and underground all in
[39:56] spaceships them big old things they had
[39:58] no down in the earth washed over in the
[40:02] flood and covered oh so far I can't find
[40:05] him he cleanse the earth and he said no
[40:12] more no more will I destroy the earth
[40:18] with water I put a covenant between I
[40:25] listen the covenant was made
[40:27] you said covenant would that wouldn't
[40:29] Noah the Covenant was made with Noah in
[40:31] God yes but you know what the covenant
[40:33] was made from the earth I'm quoting
[40:35] bread around him between God and the
[40:38] earth and he said I won't destroy it no
[40:41] more like that so he said all right
[40:48] start over
[40:52] nor takes up and starts off with all of
[40:55] his doing well I'm because he's
[40:58] delivered the member of the ark was the
[41:03] salvation of Noah are you following me
[41:08] the art was the salvation of Noah the
[41:14] water cleanse the earth read your Bible
[41:21] he said no longer will I do it he said
[41:23] cause my covenant between me and the
[41:25] earth he said no I thought he's coming
[41:28] it was between guarding Adam
[41:29] it was his made both ways I mean Garden
[41:33] Noah it was made both ways it was made
[41:36] between garden Noah that he wouldn't do
[41:37] this that or the other because he
[41:39] delivered knowing by putting him in the
[41:41] ark and brought him out as his salvation
[41:44] right you realize he had done every one
[41:47] of those people back there that wave
[41:49] letter believed it so no the Ark wasn't
[41:52] big enough well we know it wasn't big
[41:54] enough God knew they wasn't gonna do it
[41:55] but they've gotten you one more is gonna
[41:57] do it he'd have made it a foot more
[41:58] Squier right is that simple enough he to
[42:06] put in a few more feet but he knew they
[42:10] would go do it that's his foreknowledge
[42:13] we said Noah come on the ark now your
[42:17] salvation has done this and you're
[42:21] believing me they'll follow me and
[42:26] you're believing me has now placed you
[42:31] as a position taking Adam's covenant
[42:38] you've taken now this covenant and
[42:42] you're walking with it Noah had a
[42:46] covenant he said Noah you and your
[42:55] descendants are gonna be my people
[43:06] don't you see then he justified the
[43:09] earth clean with your body started
[43:12] working on you at that time with Noah in
[43:14] the washing of the world don't eat come
[43:19] into something related to you and me
[43:27] what are you following me Adam loses the
[43:32] earth right are you with me Adam lost
[43:37] the earth Noah redeems Noah it's brought
[43:49] back into a form headed towards total
[43:53] salvation no back in the or dirt or it
[44:01] can be Saint justified cleansed washed
[44:05] off and be used of God he says why I
[44:15] said you can't find things by reading
[44:18] you find things by the Prophet and the
[44:21] way he reads it because there's nothing
[44:24] in relation of Noah's covenant that has
[44:29] anything to do with a form of eternal
[44:32] life I want you to read it to them it's
[44:38] all natural things but remember the
[44:45] natural types the spiritual so he said
[44:50] in motion in the days of Noah is that
[44:57] the way your prophet brought it in
[44:58] future home he justified the world
[45:04] he sanctifies it over with Jesus Christ
[45:08] he justified the world now to prove it
[45:16] I'm going for the home you get over to
[45:23] add a to Abraham
[45:27] now remember Adams covenant was on
[45:31] condition
[45:34] Noah's covenant was on condition
[45:40] Abraham's covenant was unconditional now
[45:45] what does that mean unconditional
[45:49] well they say no conditions you got a
[45:54] wonderful understand him a very little
[45:56] spiritual sense but it's alright he's
[46:02] that hard enough to slap you to make you
[46:04] listen Adam shows you the earth lost
[46:15] Noah shows you the redeeming are the
[46:19] saving are the deliverance of the earth
[46:28] now in the earth you've got the enemy to
[46:31] fight which is your next-door neighbor
[46:34] you've got the people around you you
[46:37] know other nations etc they all want it
[46:42] now what's it show me one thing in
[46:47] Abraham in the natural point of what you
[46:52] read show me one thing that covers any
[46:56] salvation any soul redeeming see they
[47:05] didn't have it back
[47:08] come on I mean I'm open I'm I'm not
[47:13] trying to be sarcastic I'm trying my
[47:15] best to preach my heart out pretty to
[47:18] get you to see brother Branham was a
[47:21] prophet and knew what he was talking
[47:24] about
[47:25] and how he could place it together and
[47:29] make it come out but he'd make it come
[47:32] out according to the Bible read it did
[47:36] it not come to no one he says Noah my
[47:40] covenants with you I brought you through
[47:42] the archive delivered you I've given you
[47:44] salvation to bring you out he said I've
[47:48] cleansed the world and I'm making a way
[47:52] to one day bring your body back out of
[47:58] that earth is not that supposed to be
[48:05] what we're doing now coming up to
[48:11] Abraham and his unconditional covenant
[48:16] we can go through the whole story of the
[48:20] the things that he was showing with the
[48:23] animals and how they were divided and
[48:25] how the Sun was going down and all of
[48:27] the things we'll remember that's only a
[48:29] natural story those things were
[48:32] literally happening to Abram and Abram
[48:34] at the time what was Abraham's
[48:41] unconditional covenant and word of stark
[48:52] you're gonna have to show it to them in
[48:54] Adam first bring it through Noah for me
[48:58] to be able to believe you that you
[48:59] understand that can come to Abraham it's
[49:03] gotta have a natural starting come on
[49:11] Adam you lost the world Noah is going to
[49:18] start the process of a redemptive plan
[49:21] for the world
[49:27] what was the first thing to read your
[49:29] Bible what was the first thing that was
[49:31] promised to Abraham nothing about
[49:34] salvation read it bring it to me just
[49:43] don't jump over to the 15th or 16th and
[49:45] start showing the the points of this you
[49:48] know represents and the birds and all of
[49:50] this that in the other what did he say
[49:59] to Abraham what was the first thing he
[50:02] said did Abraham he didn't say you're my
[50:07] chosen that was later he didn't say this
[50:10] he didn't say that that was later was
[50:13] the first thing he said to a brown or
[50:16] Abram what was the first thing he said
[50:19] I'll give you this land from here to
[50:24] here to here and everything no ain't
[50:31] getting the whole world come on and we
[50:38] ride around the whole world he gave him
[50:43] room here desire named it that's the
[50:49] first part of the Covenant Abraham I'll
[50:54] give you everywhere what I used to love
[50:57] o brother might when we first come in
[50:59] this message he said we didn't we didn't
[51:02] come through Pentecost like the rest of
[51:04] y'all a lot of you know brother Mike he
[51:07] he'd walk around he'd shake at room that
[51:10] old left hand and he'd set that foot
[51:12] down and he'd say said I'll give you
[51:15] every where you put this over your foot
[51:16] well I could just see Abraham walking
[51:22] because that's what happened
[51:24] he started off giving him what portion
[51:27] of the earth that he was going to have
[51:30] for his inheritance he never started
[51:34] talking to him buddy turn a lot
[51:38] number you're typing and I'm running out
[51:41] of time but listen what was the next
[51:48] Abraham Abraham I'm not only gonna give
[51:57] this to you I'm gonna give it to urine
[52:01] seed after you I'm all right
[52:07] first it gives him to land he appears to
[52:11] him as different names in relation he
[52:15] finally gives him and tells him said
[52:17] it's going to be this it's going to be
[52:19] that and said I'm not only going to just
[52:21] give it to you he said I'm gonna give it
[52:22] to your seat after you
[52:26] in other words Abraham look up to the
[52:29] heavens and see the star look he just
[52:32] say end of the season now what wrote
[52:33] around said he said when they say let's
[52:36] see if I can get that quote the sands to
[52:39] the Stars the resurrection it's
[52:42] something that relationship he because
[52:47] he gives him the land he's walking on
[52:52] you know what he was walking on your
[52:56] body no I'm an American born over here
[53:00] glory hallelujah you're smart but stupid
[53:04] spiritually speaking
[53:07] sorry but it's true
[53:10] little run said nothing necessarily the
[53:13] same gases you know you could be as
[53:18] always illustrate a line could grab you
[53:20] over in Africa and won't be down and eat
[53:22] you and they could grab him up real
[53:24] quick and put him on our plane flying to
[53:26] America he gets to America he's and
[53:29] there you come out where do you belong
[53:33] Africa America so the Prophet said not
[53:39] necessarily the same gases but the same
[53:44] elements out of this
[53:49] Abraham as he is walking maybe they'll
[53:53] encourage you to look some of those
[53:54] graphs up that shows you
[53:56] Abraham was walking on your body he said
[54:02] no Widow come on that's about four
[54:08] thousand years ago I don't think you
[54:13] ought to be concerned whether you would
[54:15] hear thy her just get the point the
[54:21] point was he walking on the sand he said
[54:23] that your seed shall be as the sand of
[54:27] the seashore he starts making a promise
[54:33] a promise of redemption of the natural
[54:39] people then in a little bit he says okay
[54:45] you're doing pretty good and he says now
[54:48] hey Abram he said we'll give you a
[54:52] little bit more the Covenant he's come
[54:55] on change your name from Abram Abraham
[55:04] I'm gonna make you the father of Nations
[55:06] because you got to be that you're gonna
[55:08] be their daddy with all this spiritual
[55:10] Kingdom I thought we believed we were
[55:13] the spiritual seed of Abraham by faith I
[55:15] mean we Baptist taught that we're gonna
[55:19] be in
[55:20] well you shouldn't be that way why not
[55:23] we did right around there not to explain
[55:29] Abraham was the father of the faith to
[55:33] me we knew that the Baptist Church so we
[55:37] read the Bible but he says Abraham you
[55:46] got the land you said you got the
[55:52] promise of your seed coming forth and
[55:56] said now just remember when that seed
[55:59] gets here
[56:01] he said you gonna have to take every one
[56:03] of them men
[56:04] you do have circumcised remember Adam
[56:13] Adam if you'd have stayed for that tree
[56:16] Noah just keep staying with that tree
[56:19] you're on the right channel
[56:21] Abraham Abram you're doing right you got
[56:26] the promise of the land you've got the
[56:29] promise of your seed after you now take
[56:34] your children and we'll make another
[56:37] covenant said circumcise them children
[56:42] to make you a different nation from any
[56:46] nation in the world because no nation as
[56:48] a circumcision as a type of shadow what
[56:53] is circumcision atop of the baptism with
[56:55] oligos right a chosen people remember
[56:58] they were chosen out of the land
[57:00] remember they come up out of the earth
[57:02] remember our bodies comes out of the
[57:03] earth remember all of the story that
[57:05] I've tried to tell you it says Abraham
[57:13] just walk around just walk around
[57:18] Abraham and have yourself a good time
[57:22] since because I'm gonna give you every
[57:25] word that had ever come it's under there
[57:27] is gonna be one of your seed they pick
[57:34] up circumcision
[57:42] man drew Noah was brought back to the
[57:46] right of looking at an inheritance of
[57:50] the earth did she follow that through
[57:55] Noah a right to mankind was given to
[57:59] look at to inherit an earth because it
[58:02] was washed and they clean Abraham I'll
[58:13] give you the Land of Israel
[58:17] oh I set NARR today cuz he I don't I
[58:21] don't read
[58:22] I read the funnies in the papers you
[58:25] know I don't read the headlines that
[58:27] much because there's more news in the
[58:30] funnies but you know what I turned over
[58:34] I look today a lot of you procure it
[58:36] with Trump says I'm gonna kill Jerusalem
[58:41] to the Jews for their capital let's see
[58:45] if he gets by with it I pray to God he
[58:49] to us I pray to God that he gives them
[58:53] that Jerusalem as their capital and he
[58:57] says we do we'll put our embassy right
[58:59] there you think what you want to about
[59:04] the man he may be the guy that gets all
[59:06] of this stuff started to because what do
[59:08] you think is gonna happen if he turns
[59:10] around and makes that Jerusalem the
[59:12] capital of Israel oh you gonna have
[59:15] mayhem on the other side you're gonna
[59:17] have death in every corner because
[59:23] Jerusalem was promised to the seed of
[59:31] Abraham so he starts with the land and
[59:36] Abraham and he goes to people to call of
[59:41] his seed he winds up being to the
[59:45] circumcised of people and bringing
[59:53] man back to his country in his land as
[1:00:02] the top the what started in Jesus Christ
[1:00:11] Mariah
[1:00:13] so then justification sanctification
[1:00:16] baptism when the Holy Ghost has topped
[1:00:18] in the Old Testament followed to the
[1:00:20] letter by the reading of the world if
[1:00:22] you followed what I done I went through
[1:00:25] Genesis following it to were and what
[1:00:32] did brother Branham say on who is this
[1:00:34] Mel charity
[1:00:36] he said ever seed of the faith and
[1:00:40] getting it right ever son of the faith
[1:00:44] will take the same journey and Abraham
[1:00:48] took you know what Abraham wind up
[1:00:53] meeting he wound up meeting Almighty God
[1:00:58] ever born-again believer will meet God
[1:01:05] and be changed one day because of a
[1:01:11] covenant that he made with them people
[1:01:16] he said he'd used to make it with
[1:01:18] Abraham no he said and I'll make it with
[1:01:20] his seed after him it's not a Jew that's
[1:01:23] what you outwardly it's a Jew that's
[1:01:26] what you Edward Lee a covenant the
[1:01:36] Covenant had him you lost it Noah is
[1:01:42] beginning to appear Abraham you're
[1:01:47] coming back the way it should have been
[1:01:52] but none of them had eternal life in
[1:01:55] their soul but they had to promise
[1:02:02] they had the Covenant now but if I get
[1:02:06] this wrong you correct me how did he say
[1:02:08] it he said David said returning to me
[1:02:11] the joy of thy salvation
[1:02:13] he said now David never lost his
[1:02:15] salvation he said he just lost the joint
[1:02:20] Abraham you're gonna get your covenant
[1:02:23] made because you never lost your
[1:02:26] covenant there's never been a Christian
[1:02:30] entire shatters it ever lost show me one
[1:02:36] show me one in Tights our shadows even
[1:02:41] that a true seed did not win the victory
[1:02:44] a true seed of Abraham will always come
[1:02:52] out on top
[1:02:53] what about it come on musicians what
[1:02:57] about it a covenant but hope you thought
[1:03:03] of my point
[1:03:04] not a thing about Adam - talking about
[1:03:08] right there of eternal life not a thing
[1:03:11] about Noah and bringing it you got to
[1:03:16] come to the land you got to get the land
[1:03:19] right and then the people comes out of
[1:03:22] the land and the last thing we stopped
[1:03:26] on or sanctification coming into the
[1:03:29] baptism of the Holy Ghost with the
[1:03:34] covenant of circumcision withheld and I
[1:03:43] will stop here would you remember I
[1:03:46] invite you to do one thing brother
[1:03:50] branham's said Israel made the biggest
[1:03:52] mistake of their life in Exodus 19 when
[1:03:58] they accepted law for grace I want you
[1:04:00] to read that I want you to read it and I
[1:04:03] want you to come and show me where
[1:04:07] that's at
[1:04:18] I want you to read it I want to read it
[1:04:21] to me that they accepted law instead of
[1:04:25] grace don't come with what they say it
[1:04:33] because when it was told it was not told
[1:04:37] the commandments were coming the way it
[1:04:43] was told the people said everything you
[1:04:48] say do everything you say will do it
[1:04:55] reads about everything you say we're
[1:04:59] gonna do it we're gonna do the tubes and
[1:05:02] we're gonna do the donors do you see why
[1:05:07] they thought they got a book of rules
[1:05:11] they thought they got another covenant
[1:05:14] with do's and don'ts and Abraham had
[1:05:18] done pipes that come on them Iraq what
[1:05:32] do you think about it Mustang just read
[1:05:35] it read Exodus 19 over and over and over
[1:05:38] and over and you will see they said
[1:05:44] Moses you go up and find out what God
[1:05:46] wants us to do and we'll do every bit of
[1:05:48] it
[1:05:49] well don't do the don'ts and we'll do
[1:05:52] the dues that he says for us to do and
