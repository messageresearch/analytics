[12:16] i don't know if it was requested for my
[12:18] wife to sing again or not
[12:28] and um
[12:29] we appreciate the lord it's a
[12:32] i was listening recently to a tape of a
[12:35] man that i have a lot of respect and
[12:37] admiration for for the dead days
[12:40] going on to be with the lord but
[12:43] i would he was
[12:44] he was preaching on halloween
[12:47] but he was talking about serving the
[12:49] lord or serving the devil
[12:51] and he said i've had more fun
[12:53] and i've been more places
[12:55] and i've seen more things and done more
[12:57] things serving the lord
[12:59] than i would have ever had the
[13:00] opportunity to do if i had served the
[13:02] devil all right and i wow i realize i'm
[13:06] in the same position i've i've met more
[13:09] people right i've been more places i've
[13:11] seen more of the world
[13:12] and enjoyed every minute of it
[13:15] than i ever would have had i've gone the
[13:17] other path right so that's right um
[13:20] seek you first the kingdom of god that's
[13:22] right all these other fightings
[13:25] amen come on sweetheart and just worship
[13:27] the lord
[13:38] so
[14:11] when the valley
[14:16] the
[14:20] mountains
[14:22] to see
[14:27] the body
[14:29] is
[14:57] resources
[15:02] we've given our
[15:08] own in
[15:10] jesus name
[15:14] we press on
[15:22] in jesus
[15:47] we
[15:49] find
[15:50] the strength
[15:52] to
[16:04] is
[16:16] is
[16:28] is
[16:37] is
[16:52] oh
[17:05] yes it
[17:16] is is
[17:36] to press on
[17:48] so
[18:06] oh
[18:17] my
[18:38] hey
[18:54] hearing that song
[18:55] and makes me think of the time you know
[18:58] the bible speaks of david's
[18:59] those mighty men
[19:02] and one of them is a man who
[19:05] took a sword
[19:07] and went to fight
[19:09] and you just fall and you fall and you
[19:11] fall and you fall and you know sometimes
[19:14] you can get so wrapped up in what you're
[19:16] doing
[19:17] that you forget about anything else
[19:18] that's going on around you
[19:21] and this was such an outstanding example
[19:23] to me because
[19:25] when he was done
[19:27] he was all alone
[19:31] who whoever been fighting with him
[19:34] he had either finished
[19:36] perished
[19:37] or just pulled back
[19:39] but all of his enemies were dead
[19:42] and
[19:42] the bible says they had to take that
[19:44] man's sword
[19:46] and pry
[19:49] and i say lord you know i think what
[19:52] that said to me was sometimes god wants
[19:54] someone who's
[19:55] willing
[19:56] someone who's available
[19:58] right my father-in-law brother hughes
[20:00] says sometimes availability is more
[20:03] important than ability right yeah god
[20:05] just needed one man
[20:07] and his resolve his determination just
[20:11] to stand there and hold that sword
[20:13] enabled god to work through him till
[20:16] every enemy was dead even though i i
[20:19] suppose it never occurred to him that
[20:20] he's fighting by himself right doesn't
[20:22] really matter right when god's fighting
[20:24] through you right right it doesn't
[20:26] matter how many people see it the way
[20:28] you see it or feel the way you feel or
[20:30] are there to encourage you god's there
[20:33] that's all that matters
[20:35] and i hope i hope that someday if
[20:38] if i lay down
[20:40] have to lay this body down they'll have
[20:42] to pry this out of my hands
[20:44] and say brother tim just would never let
[20:46] go
[20:57] amen when our captain shows up to call
[20:59] us
[21:00] amen god bless you let's stand this
[21:02] evening
[21:04] and um
[21:05] brother samuel sure it's good to have
[21:07] you here amen
[21:09] and i don't ever
[21:10] um
[21:12] it just feels more comfortable when the
[21:14] shepherd's here
[21:16] everybody can just
[21:18] relax
[21:19] so it feels better to me too that's
[21:21] right and let's read tonight in st john
[21:23] chapter 18
[21:25] and verse 33
[21:29] i'm going to
[21:30] attempt to
[21:32] uh speak on a subject this evening that
[21:34] i've never attempted before
[21:36] although um
[21:38] i might have touched on it
[21:41] and i
[21:43] sometimes you feel like you're going
[21:45] into a serving
[21:47] where you don't quite know how it's all
[21:48] going to turn out you know you've got
[21:50] the ingredients yeah but but you don't
[21:52] know if it's actually going to come out
[21:53] of the oven half break
[21:55] still need a little license put on it
[21:57] you know what i'm saying
[21:58] that's where i'm at tonight writers are
[22:00] you bear with me uh we're going to read
[22:02] from saint john chapter 18 beginning at
[22:04] verse 33
[22:09] all right then pilate entered into the
[22:13] judgment hall again
[22:15] and called jesus
[22:18] and said unto him
[22:20] art thou
[22:22] the king
[22:23] of the jews
[22:26] jesus answered him
[22:29] sayest thou this of thyself
[22:32] sayest thou this thing of thyself or did
[22:35] others tell it thee of me right
[22:40] pilate answered
[22:42] am i a jew
[22:44] thy no nation
[22:46] and the chief priests
[22:48] have delivered thee unto me
[22:52] what has thou done right
[22:56] there's a lot going on here in this
[22:58] exchange right yeah i i cannot go into
[23:01] all the details tonight
[23:04] but it's tremendous amen
[23:07] all of these every word that's coming
[23:09] out of pilate's mouth is very guarded
[23:11] right and every word that's coming out
[23:13] of jesus mouth is divine right
[23:17] verse 36 jesus answered my kingdom is
[23:20] not of this world
[23:22] if my kingdom were of this world
[23:25] then would my servants fight
[23:28] that i should not be delivered to the
[23:30] jews
[23:31] but now is my kingdom not from hence
[23:35] pilate therefore said unto him
[23:37] art thou a king then
[23:41] jesus answered thou sayest
[23:44] that i am a king
[23:46] in other words jesus said that's not my
[23:48] word that's your word thou sayest
[23:51] that i am a king
[23:53] to this end was i born and for this
[23:57] cause came i into the world
[24:00] that i should bear witness
[24:03] unto the truth
[24:06] everyone that is of the truth heareth my
[24:10] voice
[24:12] pilate saith unto him
[24:14] what
[24:15] is
[24:16] truth
[24:17] that's my title tonight what is truth
[24:21] because brother sister this the question
[24:23] that was on pilate's heart then is still
[24:26] on the hearts and minds of every single
[24:30] individual
[24:31] on the earth today
[24:33] what is truth
[24:35] and when he had said this he went out
[24:37] again unto the jews and saith unto them
[24:39] i find in him
[24:41] no fault right at all right yep amen
[24:44] amen let's approach
[24:46] the author of this word lord jesus
[24:51] i realize father god even with a limited
[24:54] understanding how incapable i am
[24:59] lord of
[25:00] imparting anything
[25:04] but father i
[25:05] also realize
[25:09] how capable you are
[25:12] of healing
[25:14] of saving
[25:16] of delivering
[25:18] of rapturing with god all things are
[25:21] possible amen
[25:22] so father i ask you lord as you are
[25:25] present with us here this evening
[25:27] lord to impart unto each of your
[25:29] children and to myself as well tonight
[25:31] that portion
[25:33] that we would have need of father that
[25:35] when we leave here this evening
[25:37] we may go forth edified uplifted
[25:40] strengthened encouraged and be better
[25:43] soldiers
[25:45] better servants lord and better
[25:47] witnesses unto thee
[25:49] and ambassadors of the kingdom of heaven
[25:52] we ask that you'll grant it lord in
[25:54] jesus christ's name we pray amen
[25:56] may god bless you you may be seated
[26:00] now
[26:01] i'm going to start tonight by making a
[26:04] statement
[26:05] and
[26:05] as you already know if you were here
[26:07] this morning
[26:09] i have no reservations about throwing my
[26:12] family under the bus
[26:17] so i'm gonna set this
[26:19] like brother brandon will do i'm gonna
[26:20] set this little bottle up here
[26:22] and i'm going to tell you something
[26:24] about my mom and dad
[26:26] that if i forget to
[26:28] come back at the end of the service and
[26:30] and wrap it up
[26:32] somebody's got to remind me okay and go
[26:34] away i'm charging you with that
[26:37] now here's what i'm going to tell you
[26:38] about my mom and dad
[26:40] uh
[26:42] they were introduced to the message
[26:46] and
[26:48] they were part of the
[26:50] uh they were tied in with the believers
[26:53] who in that time believed they were
[26:55] looking for the coming of the lord
[26:57] to take place
[26:59] in 1977
[27:02] and that was a very uh
[27:05] predominant
[27:06] right belief amongst message believers
[27:10] from the 60s and into the early mid 70s
[27:13] i mean i don't know maybe 6 out of 10
[27:15] believers we're looking for brother
[27:18] brown's prediction to be fulfilled right
[27:21] and so um you know some people just went
[27:24] hog wild i mean they went out and racked
[27:27] up debt credit cards homes boats houses
[27:30] land all these things
[27:31] and then when
[27:33] when january 1st 1978
[27:36] happened and they realized they had got
[27:38] something wrong a lot of them just fell
[27:39] off right yeah now i want to ask you a
[27:41] question were they true believers
[27:44] be hard for me to say they were because
[27:46] if something like that could shake them
[27:48] loose
[27:49] would make it hard for me to to discern
[27:52] that or judge that as being a true
[27:53] believer right
[27:54] because a true believer goes back and
[27:57] instead of examining the absolute
[28:00] they would examine themselves right to
[28:02] say did i see it right
[28:05] was my view correctly did i have the
[28:07] sites lined up correctly you know we
[28:09] were talking about that yesterday in the
[28:11] minister's meeting about how brother
[28:13] billy paul used that illustration of the
[28:15] bible and the message saying you've got
[28:16] to get the sights are lined up correctly
[28:19] every time right and you know i've shot
[28:21] guns enough to realize
[28:24] um
[28:26] sometimes the gun can be perfectly aimed
[28:30] right but you got to pull the trigger
[28:32] and it's your eye
[28:34] that really makes that determination as
[28:37] to whether or not you're on target yeah
[28:38] right and and can i say it like this
[28:41] when brother branham hands us the
[28:43] message and when brother branham hands
[28:45] us the bible it's a perfectly aimed gun
[28:47] amen
[28:50] we don't need to make any adjustments
[28:52] right for windage
[28:54] elevation
[28:56] temperature humidity barometric pressure
[28:59] we need to get our head
[29:01] down on the stock of that rifle right
[29:04] and when we get our eye in the correct
[29:06] position
[29:07] we'll see the target and we'll see the
[29:09] bible and the message say exactly the
[29:11] same thing then all we got to do is pull
[29:13] the trigger
[29:14] and we hit the target right right but
[29:16] many times we you know we got too much
[29:19] fat on our cheek
[29:20] or our eyes sagging or this or that i've
[29:23] shot i've shot i understand how this all
[29:24] works and we say well the stock needs to
[29:27] be adjusted i need to raise the comb i
[29:30] need to lower the tip i know there's
[29:32] nothing wrong with the gun all right the
[29:34] problem is your angle right the problem
[29:37] is
[29:38] just and you don't even have to look at
[29:40] this life just pull the trigger right
[29:43] it'll fire and it'll hit the devil and
[29:45] it'll do the job
[29:47] every time right
[29:49] that's the truth process
[29:51] faith is that simple amen faith says i
[29:53] believe what brother graham said boom
[29:56] there he goes right right
[29:58] i believe what the best but the bible
[29:59] says boom there he goes
[30:01] you don't have to look at the sites
[30:03] right
[30:04] right if you have confidence in the man
[30:06] who set up the rifle right now and you
[30:08] have confidence that nothing's changed
[30:10] and god doesn't change it
[30:12] just pull the trigger yeah it'll kill
[30:14] the devil
[30:16] it'll kill sickness it'll kill disease
[30:19] it'll kill cancer it'll bring your loved
[30:21] ones in and it'll do everything it said
[30:24] it would do amen just pull the trigger
[30:26] all right that will cost you a dime
[30:28] amen
[30:29] my parents were looking for the coming
[30:31] of the lord in 1977. now here's what i'm
[30:33] going to tell you and then i'm going to
[30:34] stop it
[30:37] they missed it
[30:40] but only by one week
[30:43] now
[30:44] they only missed it by a week
[30:46] all right well i got you thinking now
[30:49] all right so
[30:51] let's move on jesus comes one day in the
[30:54] town and and he finds a more a grieving
[30:56] family
[30:58] mary and martha
[31:00] their brother lazarus has died
[31:02] and now they weren't just
[31:05] hey they were platinum members right in
[31:08] jesus name right yeah right they weren't
[31:10] at the gold level or the silver level
[31:13] they were platinum
[31:14] five man they kept them in their home
[31:16] you know what i'm saying in these
[31:17] charismatic ministries nowadays you can
[31:19] get in at the gold silver platinum level
[31:21] depending how much money you send in
[31:23] right
[31:24] you know and the correspondence you get
[31:25] back is largely depending on how much
[31:27] you send in
[31:28] you know you need to plant a seed and
[31:30] you can plant a big seed or a little
[31:32] seed or five dollar cedar now jesus
[31:34] ministry wasn't like that but what i'm
[31:36] saying is martha and mary were his
[31:37] closest
[31:39] some of his closest friends and
[31:40] associates
[31:41] so in our minds we have expectations for
[31:44] what that should do for us in the event
[31:46] that we should ever need something from
[31:48] the ministry
[31:49] and so
[31:50] here jesus comes back and they're
[31:52] weeping and they're saying lord if you
[31:53] had only been here
[31:55] our brother would not have died
[31:57] which was true
[32:00] to a degree he was the resurrection uh
[32:02] he never attended a funeral that
[32:04] remained a funeral that always turned
[32:05] into a resurrection i mean they had a
[32:07] track record right to go off of and so
[32:09] you know and so jesus says
[32:12] i am the resurrection yeah yeah and the
[32:15] life is oh yeah yeah we we got that
[32:18] we know that
[32:19] in the future
[32:21] there's going to be this great
[32:22] resurrection and and all the dead in
[32:24] christ shall rise and even in fact
[32:26] and one day everybody's going to write
[32:28] so yeah you know
[32:30] jesus said i am
[32:32] the resurrection right
[32:34] where have you laid him right
[32:39] okay i'm going to i'm going to leave
[32:40] that there and i'm going to move to a
[32:42] time there was a story coming all the
[32:45] way across the atlantic ocean from the
[32:46] country of england that there was a
[32:48] welsh revival going on yeah so some guys
[32:51] you know had enough money gotta get
[32:52] their plane tickets and we're gonna go
[32:53] check out this welsh revival the prophet
[32:56] of god tells us the story i'm i'm
[32:58] using it to dramatize they fly over
[33:01] there they land and no doubt they're
[33:02] looking for a tent they're looking for
[33:05] multitudes of people they're looking for
[33:07] cars
[33:08] lying down the streets filling up the
[33:09] parking lot all the things that we
[33:11] associate with what a revival is right
[33:13] and they're not finding any of that
[33:15] and so finally they reach a police
[33:17] officer and he's got a little billy club
[33:19] twirling around singing and i like to
[33:21] say it like this he's singing i'm one of
[33:23] them right
[33:24] i'm one of them i'm one of them i'm so
[33:26] glad that i can say well then they say
[33:28] um sir
[33:29] we're looking for the wealth revival
[33:33] have you heard of it
[33:34] he just keeps singing i'm one of them
[33:37] do you know where it is i'm one of them
[33:40] and finally he he said look you all
[33:42] don't get it do you
[33:44] i am the western all right
[33:47] amen right i am the welsh reviver you
[33:49] found it right you're here i'm one of
[33:52] them right man that this welsh revival
[33:55] is in the hearts of a of a farmer a
[33:58] banker a fisherman
[34:00] a a a politician or you know somebody
[34:03] works down for in the government office
[34:05] in the in the bureau and the state
[34:06] agency the the revival is not
[34:10] an event so much
[34:12] it's a person right
[34:17] oh
[34:19] just like mary and martha
[34:21] the resurrection is not so much of an
[34:23] event
[34:24] as it is
[34:26] a person right
[34:28] here's my point sometimes we're looking
[34:30] for a thing
[34:33] or a place
[34:34] or an event
[34:36] when what we're actually looking for
[34:39] is a person right right exactly what
[34:41] we're actually needing is a person right
[34:43] well sometimes we're looking for a
[34:45] person right you've seen these little
[34:47] wall ads
[34:48] they say
[34:50] s
[34:52] w f
[34:54] i s o
[34:56] s
[34:57] w m
[34:58] anybody know what that
[35:00] means single white female
[35:03] in search of
[35:05] a single white male
[35:07] oh and they've got all kinds of acronyms
[35:09] they you know it might be a b it might
[35:12] be a w
[35:13] it might be a lgbt
[35:16] i mean you know what i'm saying they've
[35:17] got all these acronyms now but it's a
[35:20] person in search of a person right
[35:22] and sometimes they're not just single
[35:25] they're single again
[35:27] and the churches now you go out these
[35:29] big churches have had these signs i've
[35:31] seen them say divorce with god yeah
[35:34] divorce with god g grace o optimism the
[35:38] dignity
[35:39] divorce with grace optimism
[35:42] and dignity
[35:43] and i'm thinking there's only one thing
[35:44] wrong with that sign it doesn't need to
[35:46] say divorce with it needs to say
[35:48] divorced from right right because that
[35:51] church that denominational church that
[35:55] harlot daughter
[35:56] is divorced
[35:58] from god right right
[36:00] by their own choosing
[36:02] the laodicean church is divorced from
[36:05] god they close the door they put christ
[36:08] on the outside his own church and they
[36:10] are the ones you know what i'm saying
[36:11] i'm not throwing off on people who are
[36:13] divorced i understand sometimes people
[36:15] land in a divorced condition as totally
[36:18] apart from their own choices
[36:20] or decisions
[36:22] but you see what i'm saying
[36:24] we've got single
[36:26] sink couples single again
[36:29] all these different things now that that
[36:31] that we're trying to cater to right
[36:34] people are in search of a person right
[36:36] right who they're really searching for
[36:38] is jesus christ
[36:41] but they're thinking well i didn't find
[36:42] it in
[36:45] in a heterosexual so maybe i'll find it
[36:48] in a homosexual
[36:49] i didn't find it in a white man maybe
[36:51] i'll find it in a black man or a woman
[36:53] vice versa right now they're searching
[36:55] for a person but they don't realize what
[36:57] they're searching for is jesus
[37:01] now there's a sister as a good friend of
[37:03] ours she wrote a song
[37:05] i have found the more
[37:07] you've been searching for it yeah people
[37:10] so many times are searching for more
[37:11] right and they don't realize we found it
[37:15] by the grace of god we've found the very
[37:17] thing they're searching for right and
[37:18] sometimes we let the devil make us
[37:20] ashamed right or closed up about the
[37:23] greatest thing that god could ever
[37:25] impart to a man or a woman and we let
[37:27] the devil beat us over the head with it
[37:29] and act like we're second-class citizens
[37:31] because we're message believers
[37:33] we're the only sane people right living
[37:35] here on the earth now
[37:37] we're the only people with the right
[37:39] mind because we have the mind of christ
[37:41] amen it's the rest of them that are
[37:44] insane right or or are going insane
[37:46] because they're searching they're
[37:48] scrambling they're trying to find a drug
[37:51] a peel a drink a concoction a recipe
[37:55] something to satisfy a longing that god
[37:57] put there and only god can feel right
[38:00] right
[38:01] so pilate was saying this what is truth
[38:04] what is truth but truth is not a thing
[38:06] brother and sister right truth is a
[38:08] person and the person of truth was
[38:11] standing there in front of heaven
[38:14] if jesus could it could have replied and
[38:17] he said you're looking at him right
[38:19] you're talking to him right truth amen
[38:21] is you are standing in the presence of
[38:24] truth right amen
[38:26] and how you react
[38:28] how you judge how you determine we'll
[38:31] determine your future right amen we'll
[38:33] determine everything about your life
[38:35] from this point forward amen that's the
[38:38] truth brother sister
[38:39] now i put myself in pilot shoes he was a
[38:42] kid
[38:44] or pilot was maybe not a king but a
[38:46] governor i should say
[38:48] he was a governor there over a roman
[38:50] province
[38:51] and he was accountable to uh the um
[38:55] the the uh the the highest roman
[38:57] authority which would have been what do
[38:59] they call those guys the roman um
[39:02] season emperor yes the roman emperor
[39:04] would be at the top of the food chain
[39:07] pilate was somewhere down here like
[39:08] middle management right
[39:10] so if jesus would confess to being a
[39:14] king
[39:15] then pilate would have roman
[39:16] jurisdiction to put him to death by
[39:19] crucifixion for insurrection
[39:22] for basically trying to establish a
[39:24] kingdom within the roman kingdom that
[39:26] would break roman law and therefore
[39:28] pilate would have roman reasons now
[39:30] because he was a roman governor right
[39:33] but
[39:34] he couldn't even get that on jesus
[39:36] because it it remember it wasn't pilate
[39:38] that wanted to crucify him it was the
[39:39] jews
[39:40] he was the religious leaders it was the
[39:42] chief priest right now uh and i may be
[39:45] getting a little bit ahead of myself but
[39:47] let me let me back up and say this no
[39:49] doubt pilate was was really just weary
[39:52] with all of the unrest
[39:54] on the turmoil all the bickering all the
[39:56] fuss and all the complaining he sees all
[39:59] the good that jesus is doing multitudes
[40:02] are following they're being healed he's
[40:04] cleaning out funeral homes hospitals all
[40:06] these different things and pilots ain't
[40:08] wonderful
[40:09] wonderful i don't have a problem with
[40:10] that but at the same time the jews and
[40:13] this is a jewish land the religious
[40:16] leaders who are the controlling faction
[40:18] there for the jewish people they're all
[40:20] torture pieces about this because this
[40:22] is crushing their idols their little
[40:24] glass cases that they put their god in
[40:27] and the mosaic their interpretation of
[40:29] the mosaic law and the torah and all
[40:31] these things jesus is just smashing it
[40:33] to bits
[40:34] but he's not violating one single jot or
[40:38] tittle of that part right he's actually
[40:40] manifesting it right he's actually
[40:42] magnifying it but because it goes so
[40:45] contrary to man's interpretation right
[40:48] of that law it's really creating
[40:49] problems so pilate's got a mess on his
[40:52] hands
[40:53] and so
[40:54] he's thinking you know i'd like to see
[40:56] peace i'd like to see tranquility i'd
[40:58] like to move on to more important things
[41:00] in my career as a politician right uh
[41:03] then have to deal with this so he this
[41:05] is on his mind now as jesus stands
[41:07] before
[41:08] now brother sister this case
[41:11] will be will prove to be the most
[41:13] critical trial in all the pilot's life
[41:16] or career right
[41:17] this trial right
[41:19] this man what will you do
[41:22] with this man called jesus amen
[41:25] he's either in your heart or he's on
[41:28] your hands right right amen as the
[41:29] prophet of god has taught us right this
[41:31] is the most critical
[41:33] moment in pilate's life and pilate's
[41:36] entire legacy is hinged on his ruling
[41:40] right in this matter right
[41:42] the rest of pilate's life and all the
[41:44] previous life of pilate will all be
[41:47] judged by this moment in time right what
[41:50] happens right here is that i'm not
[41:52] exaggerating this that's the truth right
[41:55] and pilate tried to get out of it
[41:58] a good politician will throw the ball in
[42:01] somebody else's direction so you deal
[42:02] with it he tossed it to herod harry put
[42:05] it right back on it
[42:07] now brother sister you are in pilate's
[42:09] position
[42:10] right
[42:11] right the pastor can't make that
[42:13] decision for you right
[42:15] mama can't make that decision for you
[42:17] your wife can't make that decision for
[42:19] you he's on your hands right
[42:22] you are the pilot right
[42:24] and you are gone determined whether he
[42:26] becomes your king
[42:28] or a victim of your poor judgment right
[42:32] amen
[42:34] which will in turn make you a victim of
[42:36] his righteous judgment amen amen all
[42:39] right can you follow me all right
[42:41] all right
[42:42] now we can look back 2 000 years ago
[42:45] hindsight's 2020 we could see some
[42:46] problems with this whole thing of pilot
[42:49] being blocked
[42:50] number one you should never make a king
[42:52] a judge
[42:54] it's a problem it's a conflict right
[42:57] because a king is a political office
[43:00] he's either voted in or he inherits that
[43:02] throne right a judge should be an
[43:05] appointed office
[43:07] based on the merits
[43:09] based on the training the education the
[43:12] schooling and his proven record as being
[43:14] a just
[43:16] judge
[43:18] judges should never be elected they
[43:20] should be appointed
[43:22] based on
[43:23] good track record of being a fair and
[43:26] equitable judge of the law is that right
[43:29] a king is a politician he's got to play
[43:32] politics
[43:33] he's got to appease the majority of the
[43:36] people in order to keep his office so
[43:38] when you mix that interest with the
[43:40] interest of justice it's like oil and
[43:42] water it does not mix
[43:44] you cannot do both well you will fail at
[43:47] one or both of those so we we've got a
[43:49] problem already by making pilate a judge
[43:52] there's only one king whoever makes a
[43:54] good judge and that's the king of kings
[43:58] he's a wonderful king he's a wonderful
[44:00] judge he also happens to be a wonderful
[44:03] advocate amen oh he's the prince of
[44:05] peace he's the counselor the mighty god
[44:08] the rosa sharon the lily and the valley
[44:10] the bride and morning star he's good at
[44:12] everything he does amen because he's god
[44:14] amen
[44:17] solomon was a good king
[44:19] and a good judge
[44:20] only because god
[44:22] was expressing his kingly attributes
[44:25] right through solomon right
[44:28] solomon leaned
[44:30] on the king of kings
[44:32] solomon leaned on the judge
[44:35] and he had a pretty good record as long
[44:37] as he leaned on him right but you see as
[44:40] a rule making a man who's a king a judge
[44:43] is typically not going to have some
[44:45] disastrous results right
[44:48] this is why and i'm not a lawyer and i'm
[44:50] no expert on on our judicial system but
[44:54] the american uh
[44:56] our government is set up with a judicial
[44:58] and a legislative branch right
[45:01] one writes the laws that's the
[45:04] legislature
[45:05] one
[45:06] uh rules on those laws or executes
[45:08] themselves that's the judicial that's
[45:10] right you should never cross those two
[45:13] right right they call it legislating
[45:15] from the bench
[45:16] all right and and this is the whole
[45:18] problem with our supreme court now is
[45:20] because the the
[45:22] sitting president of the united states
[45:25] gets to appoint who those judges are and
[45:28] it gets reviewed and it gets voted on
[45:29] the problem with that is that president
[45:31] is usually either a democrat or a
[45:34] republican so he's got political
[45:36] interests
[45:37] and he has been propped up by people
[45:40] with an agenda and he's got to appease
[45:41] those people so he's going to select the
[45:44] judges that he appoints the supreme
[45:46] court based on the interest of that
[45:48] political party or the agenda that he is
[45:51] representing right amen
[45:53] now the only way it's ever going to work
[45:55] is we get it back on god's way
[45:57] the american way is a fairly good way
[46:00] relative to the rest of the world but
[46:02] it's also a roman system right
[46:04] and the roman system by prophecy has
[46:07] proven to be nothing more than power
[46:10] waiting to happen right amen dust
[46:12] waiting to happen amen because we know
[46:14] by daniel's prophecy the roman empire in
[46:17] its final state will be dust right is
[46:19] that right
[46:20] so america is ashes right right right
[46:23] yeah we already know that thank you
[46:25] right
[46:25] tim i'm an american you're stepping on
[46:27] my toes i'm an american too but i'm a
[46:29] christian first right
[46:31] i'm a christian then an american amen i
[46:33] want to be out of here when america
[46:35] reaches her final result right right all
[46:38] right here are you with me tonight
[46:40] i love america i believe in being
[46:42] patriotic but i am loyal first of all to
[46:45] this word
[46:46] because that is the essence of who i am
[46:49] right i must be loyal to who i am as a
[46:52] son or as a daughter of god amen
[46:55] to lay that loyalty on the shelf and put
[46:57] precedence of being an american citizen
[46:59] above that right is a fault on my part
[47:03] amen right
[47:05] all right
[47:07] pilate saw jesus
[47:11] as the source
[47:13] of all the problems
[47:16] i didn't have these problems
[47:19] 35 years ago
[47:21] these problems all started
[47:23] 20 something years ago you know when he
[47:25] showed up in the temple at 12.
[47:27] right yeah right there
[47:31] there was
[47:33] static
[47:35] static between this 12 year old boy and
[47:38] the religious leaders right and even
[47:40] between his mother and father
[47:42] uh you know i must be about my father's
[47:45] business a little bit of static there
[47:47] right i've got news for you you're going
[47:48] to hit some static right
[47:50] as a son and daughter of god you're
[47:52] going to hit static right right
[47:54] that's right just i i'm sorry to break
[47:56] the news to you
[47:58] this is not a picnic this is a war
[48:01] this is a battle wars are about
[48:04] conflict right wars are about
[48:07] confrontation right wars do at some
[48:09] point require some courage
[48:11] a word we don't hear much about nowadays
[48:14] everybody wants to be a politician
[48:16] nobody wants to be a fighter right
[48:18] nobody wants to be a warrior or take a
[48:19] stand for what's right everybody wants
[48:22] to appease both sides of the aisle both
[48:24] sides of the coin and brother and sister
[48:26] there comes a time when right is right
[48:28] wrong is wrong you got to take a stand
[48:30] for what's right let the chips lie where
[48:32] they fall amen and the right will
[48:34] prevail
[48:35] the right is going to come out on the
[48:37] top i've got news for you now but we
[48:39] must take a stand for what is right
[48:42] amen right my i told my wife this
[48:45] morning i said you know what i would
[48:46] rather be respected
[48:49] than light
[48:51] right
[48:52] absolutely
[48:54] there are people who i know don't like
[48:56] me yeah
[48:57] because i can't go along with them i'm
[49:00] talking about family members
[49:02] oh
[49:03] you
[49:04] won't you come to my second or third
[49:06] wedding
[49:07] no i'm not coming because that preacher
[49:09] is going to say is there anyone in here
[49:10] who can show just cause why these kids
[49:12] are not walking together and i don't
[49:14] think you want me to
[49:16] i don't think you want me standing up so
[49:18] in order to to keep you from being
[49:20] uncomfortable i'm just going to i i i'm
[49:23] just going to step back now i'm not
[49:25] saying you need to be that way i'm just
[49:26] saying how i am
[49:28] well i got some static over that
[49:30] and i said look i love you
[49:33] i love you but i cannot condone right
[49:37] your actions
[49:38] i love you but i don't love what you're
[49:40] doing right now right
[49:42] if you were opening up a liquor store
[49:44] and said timothy will you come to the
[49:45] grand opening i'm not coming right
[49:47] because for me to be there would in some
[49:50] way send out the message that i convey
[49:53] or that i condone the grand opening of
[49:55] this liquor store
[49:57] i love you but i'm not coming to the
[49:59] grand opening of your liquor store right
[50:01] because i don't condone the cell of
[50:04] alcohol and liquor and all those things
[50:06] you understand right right oh my what a
[50:09] mess we're in now i've got the
[50:10] now i've got the bootleggers mad at me
[50:13] i'm supposed to be preaching on hunting
[50:15] fish
[50:17] but it's the truth brother sister right
[50:20] it's the truth and that don't make us a
[50:21] judge right right but you know how i'm
[50:24] really going to get in the mess here i
[50:26] went to overseas one time and there was
[50:28] a brother there that had done some very
[50:30] very wretched things
[50:32] and he kind of smoothed it over
[50:35] with all the americanos
[50:37] all the brothers on the other side of
[50:39] the atlantic he had kind of smoothed it
[50:40] over but he didn't make full restitution
[50:44] and reconciliation with the folks he had
[50:46] violated
[50:48] so when we got over there he invites us
[50:50] into his home and says come over have
[50:52] supper with us which we did i didn't
[50:54] even know this brother i was just along
[50:55] for the ride you know young
[50:57] young brother tim first mission trip i'm
[50:59] naive and i'm ignorance is bliss and i'm
[51:02] loving it hey
[51:05] all
[51:06] you know what broke loose
[51:08] we went in that brother's home and had
[51:10] suffered with him yeah we'd been there
[51:12] for
[51:13] a week and a half and just just hung
[51:16] over us like a black cloud but brother
[51:18] when we went into his home
[51:20] and sat down at his table and partook of
[51:22] a meal with him
[51:24] we might as well have put our strength
[51:26] right
[51:27] our blessing we might as well have just
[51:29] condoned every action that i ever made
[51:31] in their culture right when you go into
[51:34] their home and you partake of a meal
[51:36] with them
[51:37] you are putting your blessing on their
[51:38] life and their actions and we didn't
[51:40] know what the man's actions were right
[51:42] because we'd been lied to sure but
[51:44] brother we sure found out real quick
[51:47] what did he give to you you got to be
[51:48] careful right paul said with fornicator
[51:52] adulterer don't even eat women
[51:54] that's right because it sends a message
[51:58] that's that's the truth now you can get
[52:00] real legalistic with that and probably
[52:01] go overboard but it does send a message
[52:04] you you put your hand to something you
[52:06] put your blessing on it
[52:08] you better be willing to live with your
[52:10] reputation right right that you're going
[52:11] to gain as a result of that right just
[52:13] be the same thing if you've got a
[52:14] michael jackson poster up right
[52:19] is he guilty i don't know
[52:20] yeah right
[52:22] where there's smoke there's fire they
[52:23] say i don't know if the man's guilty or
[52:25] not but i'm not putting his posters up
[52:27] on my wall
[52:28] because i don't condone the music that
[52:30] he's saying
[52:31] much less what is reportedly a problem
[52:34] or a weakness that the man had in his
[52:36] life
[52:37] i you know when michael jackson be there
[52:39] i don't know but i doubt it
[52:42] but either way i'm not putting his
[52:44] posters up on my wall right right
[52:45] because to me he's a pervert right to me
[52:48] he is a vessel that satan ministered
[52:51] through and i and i hear that when he
[52:53] died on facebook there were believers
[52:55] posting these
[52:58] remorseful things
[53:00] be careful brother sister that's right
[53:03] let god be his judge
[53:05] you the bible says by the fruits you
[53:07] shall know them right amen judge the
[53:09] fruits let god determine what the tree
[53:11] is right
[53:13] amen
[53:14] he didn't give me a whole lot of
[53:16] evidence to go on to judge him
[53:19] and brother brenham said elvis sold his
[53:21] soul for a fleet of cabinets and called
[53:23] him a modern day judas is scary
[53:25] now if the prophet said that about him
[53:26] i'm not apologizing for that right
[53:28] brother brandon said it i say with what
[53:30] brother brennan said amen
[53:32] michael jackson to me was a modern day
[53:34] uh an even worse
[53:37] form and version of elvis presley now
[53:39] i'll get off of that because i made i
[53:40] made the michael jackson's fans man
[53:43] i'll tell you when i was in elementary
[53:45] school they wanted us to sing we are the
[53:47] world
[53:48] we are the children yeah we are the ones
[53:51] to make a brighter day so let's start
[53:53] living yeah you know what i want to sing
[53:55] it right i had enough
[53:57] god in me through my godly parents to
[53:59] know there's something wrong with that
[54:01] man and something wrong with his music
[54:02] right yeah right and i could realize
[54:04] even at six years old i'm not the world
[54:07] yeah you say you're the world if you had
[54:08] to i'm not the world right now
[54:11] jesus said this ain't my kingdom
[54:14] this ain't my kingdom brother sister
[54:16] michael j elvis is not my king
[54:18] he might be the king of rock and roll
[54:20] i'm not rock and roll
[54:22] michael jackson might be the king of pop
[54:24] i'm not pop right right man i'm the word
[54:26] all right amen
[54:28] when you've seen the father when you've
[54:30] seen me you've seen the father i come
[54:32] from god and i return to god i identify
[54:35] with this word right amen amen my king
[54:37] is god right amen i don't know who your
[54:39] prophet is my prophet is william branham
[54:42] he's still my prophet amen you say
[54:44] brother he's dead in the grave he's
[54:45] still the prophet and the holy ghost is
[54:48] the prophet to the age
[54:50] i don't know who you're following but i
[54:51] know i'm following god through his
[54:53] vindicated servant messenger
[54:56] oh i've stopped on all kind of toast now
[54:57] man but i believe it's the truth right
[55:00] and if i didn't tell you what i believe
[55:01] i'd be hypocritical right that's right
[55:03] bro amen as far as i know they didn't
[55:05] invite a hypocrite here to preach
[55:07] inviting me here totally be myself for
[55:09] better for worse
[55:10] amen so pilate saw jesus as the source
[55:13] of all his problems
[55:15] well you could in one way of looking at
[55:17] it he was
[55:19] but in another way of looking at it
[55:21] jesus could have been the solution right
[55:24] that's right all depends how you deal
[55:25] with it right exactly
[55:27] and the same thing is happening again
[55:30] today
[55:32] sure jesus
[55:34] is on trial again
[55:37] today right right amen now i'm going to
[55:40] try to wrap up so listen to me
[55:43] he's not on trial
[55:46] as a galilean yeah wearing
[55:49] yeah
[55:51] middle eastern clothes
[55:53] with a beard and shoulder-length hair
[55:55] right
[55:56] no no that's right
[55:58] that's jesus of 2000 years ago right now
[56:00] he's the same yesterday
[56:02] that's right but the form right that he
[56:05] has revealed himself in this album right
[56:07] is very much
[56:09] on trial again right right
[56:12] all you say brother tim you're talking
[56:14] about the message i am talking about
[56:16] that's right but i'm not necessarily
[56:18] talking about the little little
[56:19] paperback books
[56:21] or big paperback books
[56:23] or cds and dvds and mp3s and
[56:27] no i'm not talking about
[56:28] information right the message
[56:32] is not just data
[56:34] right right
[56:35] it's not just letters on the page or
[56:37] audio
[56:38] on on a set on a real
[56:41] or however digital whatever it's not the
[56:43] message is more than that amen right i
[56:46] want to tell you the bible is more than
[56:48] this book
[56:49] the bible is a life
[56:51] all right the word of god is a life the
[56:53] message is a life amen and where the the
[56:56] form that god is revealing himself in
[56:58] now amen is living
[57:02] bride right amen wife right
[57:05] misses jesus christ amen the bride is
[57:08] the body of christ upon the earth now
[57:11] living walking talking breathing working
[57:15] coming to church paying their taxes
[57:17] paying their tithes driving around
[57:19] flying around the world doing missions
[57:21] work preaching all these different
[57:23] things that is the body of jesus christ
[57:26] here today upon the face of the earth
[57:29] now are you part of that body
[57:31] i mean by god's grace we are part of
[57:33] that body but now we are on trial today
[57:36] right right we are under the microscope
[57:38] right
[57:39] we are in the in the aquarium right and
[57:42] the world is looking in saying what kind
[57:43] of creature is that yeah
[57:46] what kind of life is that that's
[57:48] insanity why they're listening to tapes
[57:51] of a man that's 50 plus years ago and
[57:54] they haven't even upgraded them yeah
[57:57] hello
[57:59] we're also still using this old black
[58:01] book amen that has never been upgraded

[58:07] he's the same yesterday today and
[58:10] forever i am the lord thy god and i
[58:12] change not
[58:13] amen why doesn't he change because he
[58:15] doesn't need to
[58:17] why doesn't he improve because it's not
[58:19] possible
[58:20] why doesn't he update because it's
[58:22] unnecessary he is right right he just is
[58:26] right right he's not was or will be he
[58:29] is
[58:30] he is god he's the author of life right
[58:33] he's that he's not he's not just the
[58:35] source of our healing he is our human
[58:37] right
[58:38] he's not just the source of our
[58:40] salvation he is our salvation
[58:42] he's not just giving us rapturing faith

[58:46] our rapture
[58:48] he is our boaz he's our king he's our
[58:51] groom he's our judge he's our attorney
[58:54] he's all of these different things right
[58:56] amen
[58:57] oh hallelujah

[59:00] you're guilty and you walk into the
[59:02] courtroom you see that man there in the
[59:04] black room and fear grips you
[59:07] because you know you're guilty
[59:09] and you know your destiny rests in the
[59:12] hands
[59:13] of that man amen yeah but he's just a
[59:16] man

[59:23] likes to play golf or hunt or fish or
[59:26] any of these things
[59:28] right

[59:40] walking through the door of his soul and
[59:42] his wife you didn't take out the trash
[59:46] she's not scared of him at all
[59:49] but he might be a little fearful of her
[59:52] but it's their relationship to him right
[59:55] you can see the lion you can see the
[59:58] judge you can see the king sitting on
[1:00:00] the throne and don't scare you a bit
[1:00:02] because oh that's my groom

[1:04:49] right
[1:04:50] it's the revealed word
[1:04:52] it's the messenger oh yes brother
[1:04:54] brown's on trial yeah any of y'all got
[1:04:57] any of y'all got the internet yeah
[1:04:59] brother branham is on trial sure that's
[1:05:01] right
[1:05:02] they're trying
[1:05:03] a man that that died
[1:05:05] not not literally but in a sense died in
[1:05:08] 1965 right and he's on trial yeah his
[1:05:12] message is on trial
[1:05:14] his ministry is on trial and you know
[1:05:15] what you're next
[1:05:17] that's right right that's right you're
[1:05:19] next
[1:05:23] we're in the pre-trial hearing right now
[1:05:24] the depositions are being made right and
[1:05:27] the prosecuting attorney which believes
[1:05:29] this message is a fallacy
[1:05:31] and actually doesn't even believe the
[1:05:32] bible although they claim they do
[1:05:35] they're bringing in the evidence now to
[1:05:36] determine what is admissible and what's
[1:05:38] inadmissible right right
[1:05:40] and i got to tell you
[1:05:42] that they're not taking this to the
[1:05:45] state court no they're not taking this
[1:05:47] to a district court right they're not
[1:05:49] taking this to the supreme court
[1:05:51] because if the truth be told much of the
[1:05:54] logic that is going into their argument
[1:05:56] wouldn't even stand up right right in a
[1:05:58] county court right no all right that's
[1:06:00] right in a county court
[1:06:03] judge with half a brain would throw out
[1:06:06] their case
[1:06:08] based on their evidence
[1:06:10] okay so you don't have 17 death
[1:06:13] certificates
[1:06:14] for 17 men that fell off the louisville
[1:06:17] municipal bridge so what
[1:06:20] they were lucky to have birth
[1:06:22] certificates back then
[1:06:24] much less death certificates
[1:06:26] throw that out
[1:06:28] throw that out that's not even evidence
[1:06:31] that's not even good circumstantial
[1:06:33] evidence that's a bunch of hogwash that
[1:06:35] the devil has thrown up
[1:06:38] to try to make
[1:06:40] to manifest the make believer and the
[1:06:42] unbeliever right right and you will be
[1:06:44] successful all right oh i got news for
[1:06:46] you i can tell you how this case is
[1:06:48] going to turn out already
[1:06:49] they'll never change a bride member into
[1:06:52] a foolish virgin
[1:06:56] hallelujah
[1:06:57] i've got my mind made up
[1:07:00] and i won't turn back hallelujah
[1:07:03] they'll never win the case here because
[1:07:05] my womb is sealed right my mind is
[1:07:08] already made up right i don't care if
[1:07:10] they pull out photographs that's
[1:07:11] circumstantial right i can make a
[1:07:13] photograph right now with a a a photo
[1:07:16] editing software what do they call that
[1:07:19] photoshop
[1:07:21] i could photoshop william brown sitting
[1:07:23] at the bar drinking a liquor if i wanted
[1:07:25] to drink throw it out
[1:07:27] i don't care if you got a pair up a
[1:07:29] picture of him wearing a pair of shorts
[1:07:31] yeah cool
[1:07:32] yeah
[1:07:33] oh god made a mistake
[1:07:35] my goodness
[1:07:37] god's up in heaven scratching his head
[1:07:39] there i had my prophet there i put the
[1:07:41] pillar fire over his head there i've
[1:07:43] indicated his ministry had kings and
[1:07:45] yeah and all these things prayed for and
[1:07:46] vindicated vindicative indicated
[1:07:48] medicaid and now 50 something years
[1:07:50] later they come up a photograph with him
[1:07:52] over in safari
[1:07:54] amen if i'd have been in there i'd have
[1:07:55] been wearing the same thing the prophet
[1:07:56] was right amen
[1:07:59] it don't it does not invalidate the
[1:08:02] message in any way
[1:08:04] because i got news for you the message
[1:08:06] was not a kentuckian born with the
[1:08:08] seventh or eighth grade education the
[1:08:10] son of charles and alan branham the
[1:08:12] message was the word of god
[1:08:15] jesus christ revealing himself through a
[1:08:20] son of amen
[1:08:24] we're talking about two different things
[1:08:25] here right right we're talking about a
[1:08:28] messenger and we're talking about a
[1:08:29] message right and the message was a
[1:08:32] mortal man born in sin shaken iniquity
[1:08:35] come the world speaking lives right the
[1:08:37] message was christ amen amen sinless
[1:08:40] spotless virtuous
[1:08:44] faultless that's right amen
[1:08:47] amen
[1:08:48] before during and after amen
[1:08:54] and guess what
[1:08:56] we're that word too
[1:08:57] come on
[1:08:59] oh right brother
[1:09:00] you are flawless yes
[1:09:05] because my case got thrown out of court
[1:09:06] right now the judge was biased
[1:09:11] he was married to the defendant
[1:09:16] and the attorney was his son
[1:09:18] yeah
[1:09:20] and was
[1:09:22] her husband too
[1:09:25] because they're thinking through a
[1:09:26] trinitarian mindset here's god the judge
[1:09:29] jesus the son and the holy ghost in the
[1:09:31] bride three people they don't realize
[1:09:33] they're all the same right

[1:09:57] reveal himself to then come back in the
[1:09:59] form of the holy spirit and live in
[1:10:02] temples born in sin shape no iniquity
[1:10:05] scarred a man wrecked in sin but god
[1:10:09] hiding himself in simplicity and
[1:10:12] revealing himself in the sin
[1:10:14] and it blows the mind of the world
[1:10:17] and they're watching this trial saying
[1:10:18] i'm confused
[1:10:20] i'm confused this looks like a set up it
[1:10:22] is a setup amen
[1:10:24] it's a setup before the foundation of
[1:10:25] the world
[1:10:27] the judge is related to the son and
[1:10:29] they're both related to the defendant
[1:10:30] who happens to be the bride
[1:10:32] of both of them all right go figure it
[1:10:34] out amen
[1:10:37] you say brother tim you're going crazy
[1:10:38] yeah
[1:10:39] all right emma go ahead
[1:10:42] it's only crazy if you're not part of
[1:10:43] the bride right right right the bride
[1:10:45] loves it right amen she loves the setup
[1:10:48] right
[1:10:49] she keeps winking at the attorney you
[1:10:51] know
[1:10:52] he gets winking at the judge yeah
[1:10:55] anyway did you hear what that
[1:10:57] if you weren't that i think they called
[1:10:58] appointed
[1:11:00] the guy was making all the accusations i
[1:11:02] could be wrong about that i know he's a
[1:11:04] prosecuting attorney
[1:11:05] said you heard that prosecution attorney
[1:11:07] just said
[1:11:08] he just don't realize
[1:11:10] that's inadmissible evidence right
[1:11:13] do you hear what he just accused him of
[1:11:16] just shot that from the record yeah
[1:11:19] doesn't count
[1:11:21] never did it in the first place
[1:11:24] it don't matter how much that old devil
[1:11:26] stands over in the apps
[1:11:28] that's right the judge has already
[1:11:30] written his sentence all right
[1:11:31] all right pardon right right never did
[1:11:34] in the first place
[1:11:35] amen but satan can't see that
[1:11:38] he's not privy to that
[1:11:40] so he's got to play the parts right and
[1:11:43] the poor guy
[1:11:44] when it's all said and done it's going
[1:11:46] to go down as one of the biggest
[1:11:47] failures
[1:11:48] in all of his career amen right
[1:11:52] all right but now
[1:11:54] i told you and and i'm trying to come to
[1:11:56] a close here i don't have any diet
[1:11:58] packets tonight but yeah
[1:12:01] i do have to respect your time
[1:12:03] and i think we got a baby shower
[1:12:05] afterwards right the message is on trial
[1:12:07] again right
[1:12:08] but the arguments that are being made
[1:12:11] and the little
[1:12:13] things that are being thrown up
[1:12:16] like they're punching holes in the
[1:12:18] message
[1:12:19] it is absurd
[1:12:21] the things that they are throwing up to
[1:12:23] say this and somehow some way makes you
[1:12:26] know and they're saying um and i don't
[1:12:28] want to give this too much traction or
[1:12:29] give this too much attention but you
[1:12:31] know
[1:12:32] they're saying well
[1:12:35] branham tabernacle
[1:12:39] brother collins
[1:12:41] brother fill in the blank right this
[1:12:44] ministry the whole message ministry
[1:12:47] brother
[1:12:48] sister
[1:12:50] if i
[1:12:51] tomorrow
[1:12:53] go out and rob six banks
[1:12:58] turn over
[1:12:59] 20 liquor stores
[1:13:01] and i show up on the front page of the
[1:13:03] national enquirer
[1:13:06] with the most ill-famed people in the
[1:13:09] city as my companions
[1:13:12] has
[1:13:13] nothing to do
[1:13:15] with the messages
[1:13:18] we're not all
[1:13:20] it's not all one big pile of potatoes no
[1:13:22] that's right amen
[1:13:23] bread and tabernacle is a church
[1:13:27] it is sovereign
[1:13:28] it is independent
[1:13:30] is it a message believing church
[1:13:31] absolutely
[1:13:32] but brennan tabernacle is not the
[1:13:35] message right right amen for other
[1:13:37] colleagues with all and respect is not
[1:13:40] the message right he's not the
[1:13:44] spokesperson
[1:13:45] for the message that's right right the
[1:13:48] message needs no spokesperson right
[1:13:50] it speaks for itself right
[1:13:53] brother branham never needed a pr agent
[1:13:56] he never needed a
[1:13:58] marketing relations
[1:14:00] all these things now that these
[1:14:02] ministries
[1:14:03] right that's right he was god's prophet
[1:14:05] amen
[1:14:07] that in itself carries
[1:14:09] some incredible
[1:14:11] perks right
[1:14:12] that even when you do make a mistake
[1:14:16] god
[1:14:16] never changes his mind right
[1:14:19] about his decision to ordain you as his
[1:14:22] prophet right amen right right amen and
[1:14:24] when a prophet
[1:14:26] should say something that he knows could
[1:14:29] be misunderstood or could even be
[1:14:30] contrary to his own way of wanting to
[1:14:32] present it
[1:14:33] he corrects himself right that's right
[1:14:35] and if he doesn't god still vindicates
[1:14:38] it
[1:14:39] and the people who believe it still are
[1:14:41] entitled to the benefits of it right
[1:14:43] regardless right so really we're in a
[1:14:45] pretty good position
[1:14:47] as long as we don't take it upon
[1:14:49] ourselves to become the judge
[1:14:52] ourselves
[1:14:53] and start well maybe this does bear
[1:14:56] some examination here now let me see uh
[1:15:00] brother oh that
[1:15:02] it's circumstantial right
[1:15:04] all of this stuff right i'm disappointed
[1:15:06] because i thought these guys were more
[1:15:08] intelligent right than to throw some of
[1:15:10] this garbage right
[1:15:12] that's any kind of proof
[1:15:15] that the mess you say brother tim i'm
[1:15:16] going to tell them you said that i hope
[1:15:18] they're watching
[1:15:20] all right right now
[1:15:21] because they won't reply to my emails
[1:15:24] so maybe they'll reply to this message
[1:15:27] it's the truth that i'm standing on a
[1:15:31] message
[1:15:33] i'm standing
[1:15:34] where eve should have stood yes
[1:15:48] he didn't ask me to comprehend it and
[1:15:50] figure out all the intricacies and
[1:15:52] details of it he said believe it right
[1:15:55] and the rest will take care of itself
[1:15:56] right amen so i stand here before you
[1:15:58] this day by god's grace as a believer
[1:16:02] of this message amen and i say what is
[1:16:05] truth is a person right right amen the
[1:16:08] person of jesus christ
[1:16:10] has revealed himself this hour in what
[1:16:12] we call the message
[1:16:14] of the hound amen right he
[1:16:17] thought so much of his servant and
[1:16:19] prophet that he even had his photograph
[1:16:21] taken
[1:16:23] i've got news for you that wasn't a
[1:16:24] rocket trail oh right that's right that
[1:16:27] was a supernatural cloud
[1:16:30] and supernatural clouds supernatural
[1:16:32] anything are never to be
[1:16:36] understood scientifically no right
[1:16:39] i will take you back to the days of noah
[1:16:41] noah said it's going to rain
[1:16:43] science said it ain't going to rain
[1:16:46] we've got the instruments to probably
[1:16:47] ain't going to write who are you going
[1:16:48] to believe right right
[1:16:50] the supernatural vindicated prophet
[1:16:53] are the super smart scientists yeah
[1:16:56] i got news for you if you lean on this
[1:16:58] scientist
[1:16:59] they realize they were wrong
[1:17:01] only
[1:17:02] it was too late
[1:17:04] to get on that boat
[1:17:06] by the time the proof came
[1:17:10] to
[1:17:11] absolve any doubts
[1:17:13] faith is believing something that your
[1:17:16] senses won't declaration
[1:17:17] exactly
[1:17:18] it didn't take faith to feel a raindrop
[1:17:21] when the raindrops started falling the
[1:17:23] door to the ark was already closed and
[1:17:25] the believers of the prophet's message
[1:17:28] were safely sealed inside amen and the
[1:17:32] believers of the scientific world and
[1:17:35] i.e the doubters of the message were
[1:17:37] outside
[1:17:38] let me in
[1:17:40] i'm now a believer i want admission to
[1:17:43] the ark i will pay it for a ticket i'll
[1:17:45] buy your spot
[1:17:47] no you won't okay that's right i didn't
[1:17:49] buy my spot right amen silver and gold
