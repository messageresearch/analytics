Sunday after the evening service will be the shower uh downstairs for sister Rachel so remember that all right father we thank you Lord for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for all things and we pray that you would just help us to Lord in understanding of how to present what you've given unto us and Lord we pray that you would just teach us then to wait and to speak what you have said and that that only Lord we ask you to forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness bless those that are away from us traveling back home today and all some doing it some on vacations but we pray that you would just bless each and every every one remember Sister Regina there with the shingles Lord just touch her and and help her cuz we know that's a horrible thing and a lot of pain so just be with her and condem the pain Lord make it go away let your light shine as we read your word you come and speak through our hearts and our lives guide us now in Jesus name amen Romans I mean Matthew 19 3-9 and then we'll go to Romans 7 1-6 and the Pharisees came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave to his wife and they shall be twain shall twne they twine shall be one flesh wherefore there are no more twine but one flesh what therefore God ha joined together let not man put a under and they say unto him why did Moses then command to give a writing a divorce and to put her away he saith unto them Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another commit adultery who so Marth her which is put away way does commit adultery all right go to Romans 7 verse one know ye brethren for I speak to them that know the law how that the law which law ha dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the law watch the law as long as he liveth for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loose from the law of her husb husband now that this is written Paul see you got the law that had dominion over a man that's the natural all right then you got this is a law of the marriage and wife see all right everybody following me see verse Two for the one which ha a husband is bound by the law to her husband now that's that's fine with the law bound with it but it's really the law of bound or husband that's more stronger than the the natural law of the land you know all right so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loose from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she' be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulterous though she be married to another man wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law now he's coming right back over to the art part of the law right by the body of Christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that you should bring forth fruit unto God for when we were in the flesh the Motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit under death but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now we're going to be covering a large area this afternoon and if I get down so far and I see that it's going to take too much time we will just cut off and go uh and wait until finishing it wind state but now we're going to have three things in mind all right now that's the reason I ask you to read the marriage and divorce and to read The Invisible ible Union all right now especially in the invisible Union you will find three things that brother brandom is covering all right he is going to be covering the new birth how that you must be born again right he does a covers a lot in that all right then he will be covering and using the illustration there that you must be dead to be born again you must die and come forth you know all right then he goes into the illustration of like the grace of marriage and divorce right how that your old husband must be dead you know before you can be married to uh the second husband and it' be okay and be legal about it cuz he's speaking about the church or for the women see to do basically on the line but the men are covered in it but now all right then the L is what he calls and we'll read it here in just a moment he says that this Romans 7 is a greater portion of marriage and divorce all right a greater portion of marriage and divorce which I've told you this morning and I've always preached it this way since many many years ago and seeing it that you know most everybody can talk about the grace of marriage and divorce for the natural act and things and they think that that's all they need right well uh you know I don't I believe that as I said this morning you have Moses giving the natural then you had Paul giving a natural and spiritual application applying it typing it and then you had brother Brandon to come in with the point of the uh spiritual part picking it up and taking it back to a natural point to carry us into the millennial Reign and eternities and herea see in a glorified this glorified body not a new body not something else is this because we're going you know we have to see that that's capable of being redeemed all right now so then if we covering it this afternoon remember that thought and when we're reading keep your mind let it go with the thought I'll try my best to to emphasize uh the point going through of what's being said but uh you know I want you to think of it that way that you'll hear Brother random talking about that we've got to be dead to the world right all right and that's that's that's good because that's the new birth that's right all right we have to cover that away all right next he will be speaking of our old denominational husband right that even after we were born again we were still tied up in organized religion you know and maybe it still are today because if our old husband is still alive then uh you know uh it has to be dealt with right and then he's covering the the natural of marriage and divorce because he covers that that that husband you know the old husband has got to be dead before the woman can be married again right so keep these things in your mind and just kind of watch it as you go through and if you if you you miss it then you know just pick it up and and say well okay we're in one of these stages cuz each one will be related that's why I've tried to to figure out which way and for many many years I've U tried to preach on this and have many times but uh you know trying to find a a way to present it to a word that can be understood yes you say well we just we just accept the grace of Mar and divorce well what about the old husband the denomination that's right what do you mean I left that a long time ago brother R said not to divorce him or hang him up in a closet that's right right he got to be dead right yeah but Brother D I never was in a organization or a denomination he's born one that's right solves a problem right no matter where you ever went to a church or what you born denominationalism we were born to our adulterous parent Eve amen and her acts and the things of what took place all right so then the best thing to do is just to to listen and then say okay now this is what is want I'm wanting to get right here and let me understand all right cuz like we were talking about this morning a supernatural Revelation all revelation is Supernatural now I made a statement they said at the end which I didn't mean to make it that way but two sisters said I did so okay I said that Cain had a supernatural Revelation well I didn't mean it that way if I meant Cain had a revelation because he had a revelation like the denominate Nations has got a revelation they got a revelation of the Trinity yes right but it ain't no true Revelation it's not a supernatural revelation right I was trying to do and if my mind see when you're up here your mind's going to and your brain and your head and you're trying to get it all together and and trying to bring it down to where people can follow it so if I said that statement in there and I'm sure I did because they called it to my attention I meant to say that Cain got a revelation but not a revelation from God right see if he had got it from God it would have been a supernatural Revelation right all right because all Revelation then is Supernatural right the reveal word of God but what we think is a revelation see people say I like I said this more people say why it's been revealed to me there's a trinity well where did it come from it had to come from the devil that's right it's surely not a supernatural Revelation out of the word of God because there's no such thing in the word of God Amen see you say but brother Dale you you mean I didn't have I well why you upset you know watch the what you know the flutter of the you know of the being back when somebody says something that sometimes it proves that we we're wrong you know and we need help all right but see a supernatural Revelation the word of God being revealed unto us is a supernatural Revelation it brings a supernatural God we read this morning to Earth into the individual to be with us as a supernatural God in a supernatural people and you know that's what we are by the new birth we are the supernatural people of God all right now try to get that and then we'll go on but remember now I want to keep stating it see we're going to have to be dealing with three things so if I cross over somewhere in it he you know try to get it in the right place and talk to me later about it and so you say well brother D you said so and so well I was applying it to this you know and and this is what I talking about here number one see all you're thinking on number three and and see it it'll go backwards and forward so forgive me I I've been trying to find a way for I said for 40 40 years to express into human terminologies what a prophet was trying trying to do of of telling us about these things all right now this came to pass on this part of it because a question was asked that I said I would try to cover today that a question was asked that we didn't cover this past Wednesday and the question is how do you know that you know that your denominational husband is dead now how you know that your old denominational husband is dead okay now how do you know that you're free in the grace of marriage and divorce how do you know that you're born [Music] again see they all have to tie together to make a beautiful picture that's right one can't be going this way and another one that way and that's just you know it has to come together to make a beautiful picture amen because it's just in other words if if you got the new birth and you know that that old nature and old things is dead and gone all right and you're born again then you're capable of moving up to the next step that's right which would be into the basis of of a spiritual condition see to find out how you're old denominational husband see that's where people thinks they think the day they got born again that that covered everything but it doesn't that's right I was trying to find a quote last night I know brother R made it but it's you know how it is with the computer you got to get the exact wording but one time he made a statement like this he said we are free by the blood of Jesus Christ he said but we're Bound by our by our Creeds and ideas and doctrines or something my that right that's right brother you said oh no I'm free well why is the old husband showing up every once in a while right you know I mean if he was naturally married you know and you had an old husband and he started coming back every a while and the neighbors could see him you know they'd say well hey you know you got a problem problem because that was the guy that you divorced or something he keep showing up well if that's the way it is in the natural what about in the spiritual how do we know we're born again how do we know that her old denominational husband is dead how do we know the grace of marriage and divorce is applied to us now you see why I was putting the emphas this morning on his Supernatural Revelation yes right all right but the emphasis was upon hoping you was getting it one thing that you say well brother Brandon said it was a supernatural Revelation because of the opening of The Seven Seals All right but was that something contrary to the Bible no it had to be what the Bible was talking about it had to be in the word that's right you know when he T cut the top off the pyramid and looked down in there and he saw things that light had never shine don't but it had to be part of the word they said brother ROM you can do this or do that he sit there trying to trap me he said cuz you can't add to the Bible That's So then now the point that I was making this morning people as I said they'll hold up a spoken word hold up a marriage and divorce but boy bless God I believe the grace is right here in this book where the Prophet said it but now I don't believe it's other things he said well now where are you at right now we look at that as denominationalism and things out there right and I just finished the series preaching on the the doctrines and things among the people of this message that I didn't agree with but see I don't see how in the world you can take a two Soul Doctrine and come out with a an an understanding of one true and living God that's right how can you take a two Lord Doctrine and come out to be an understanding of one true and living God that's right how can you take the uh that Jesus wasn't God to the River Jordan and stuff like that how can you do that and come out with an understanding of one true and living God so then the the people are denying what brother Ram said and see their old husband is still alive amen CU her old husband was the doctrin just like the two Souls is a Mormon Doctrine I proved that 40 years ago there is a Doctrine come down from the Mormon Church down and filtered into the message not from Brother random no way right and see then you see all of these brothers coming out with their own Doctrine their own ways then it goes to prove that their old husband's not dead right but now that's no problem of mine you know what right you know what I'm concerned about is my old husband that's right right see you know cuz it'll it'll come down that you'll see our old husband is just her own ideas that's right I hope that gets to you it's just our own ideas amen see that becomes denominationalism just as M much as it would be if we had a great big steeple out front out here and had our nebor the call you know whatever but see now that's what I'm wanting you to see and what we want to get started on so it's so you'll see the point okay brother Anderson pull up to the number one on the quote now there we got a lot in here I think I have eight pages and some of this is all is a and when you see you don't see it on there but what I'm looking at says when I look and see it when that line is on the side that means it's a continuation of reading paragraph after paragraph after paragraph see all right so then you know we'll we'll cover so look what he said this is taken from paragraph 35 invisible Union right of Christ preaching 65 11:25 and basically almost every quote except three today will be out of that all right Paul is given an illustration in our scripture now he's read Romans 7 coming down in his thought all right about the law and Grace and illustrating it black marriage and divorce now watch it this passage is very seldom preached on because it more or less pertains to like marriage and divorce all right now but it also pertains to a greater portion of marriage and divorce a greater portion so then this that we're going to get on here is going to be a greater portion that's all right so if if marriage and divorce was a great portion what is what is invisible Union that's right right right and I like the title you know you ever thought about it the invisable union of the bride of Christ amen doesn't say the invisible Union of the bride with Christ that's right am it's the invisible Union of the bride of Christ right coming together here before we go there all right but look what he says but it also pertains to a greater portion of marriage and divorce of how that he's trying to set in order here that we as as a church can no be no can no more be married to the world and to Christ at the same time and and be legal and lawful about it then it can be for a woman to be living with a husband while she's got a living husband and I have my own thoughts of that remember he was out in Louisiana when he was doing this uh preaching it so he said I have my own thoughts of that and I believe that what the Bible says is true but now I believe also is to my belief that it unfolds one of the great mysteries of prophecies now look at that and I hope that the Lord will help us tonight as we deliver this to our waiting people across the country p r o p h e c y prophecy p r o p h e s y is prophesy okay prophesy is speaking it right right prophecy is a setting in order of scriptures right that's what I said 40 years ago I'm still even looking back at my notes time I still have them matter of fact and Richard then working on putting the entire message that we preached from here that's been brought from here since 882 onto the internet amen so then you'll see if you want to go back there and check to see if I'm right you'll find out I preached marriage and divorce probably about five times since then at least at many all right well look then it unfolds one of the great mysteries of Prophecy one of the great Mysteries of the word of God being unveiled setting in order the scriptures and bringing it to a place to have the word of God that was supposed to be right see that's not prophesy that's not de it's prophecy it's the setting and Order of scriptures bringing it to a position to see and understand what we're talking about but get to point now as we go along because we'll we'll keep referring back this is a greater portion of marriage and divorce right all right you say well boy bless God I thank God for the grace amen so do I but there was a lot more happened that day than what people was thinking about right amen the day the prophet gave the grace of marriage and divorce you know we know it was not him it was God speaking through him to the people no more than it was Moses it was God in it was Christ in Moses that was speaking to the people the grace of marriage and divorce it was Christ in Paul that was speaking in the grace of marriage and divorce and it was Christ and brother random to bring that to the church all right but just think about what he could stand there and see and see like I said most everybody they just want the part of where he said that you know I can read it to you he said I'm free well amen but now what about the invisible Union of your old husband well now leave that alone cuz there was a lot of people in this message and I can call names that when brother around passed away a lot of the people that you hear Brother randam calling their names wound up back in organized religion no literally went back to organize religion amen after all he said about those things that he calls them brothers right so listen Church which is which is the part that we need what just need the grace just tell us about the grace brother Dale I now I want to just ask you a question this is just simple old brother Dale but this is this is what's bothered me for 40 years so I want you to express it and I'm serious what happened in the marital situations what actually took place there when the prophet said I say go on as you are what literally took place right right what did God do you never thought of that I guess I'm the only one that's made that way like I've always said I will not put my mind to working on cars or anything because I will tied up into that and I would just set it to do that to do that to do that you know and everybody knows it works with me I I don't talk when I'm working because I'm thinking and hard for me to think and talk now that's not hard for a lot of people to do seemingly but it's hard for me to work and think and I'm up on a ladder and timbo's down on the ground and he's talking away to me and I measure a Bard is 36 and 3/4 most of you that records in there you don't have to worry about it don't with me I'm sorry I come down off the ladder I'm thinking about what he said I come down was that 33 and 3/4 3 back up the ladder I go and I take me a piece of board no I'm sorry that's just the way I am I'm sorry cuz I have a one track mind that's for wife she'll tell you in a hurry she's shaking her head on you turn around her look at her if you want to she's Shing her head on but I think like that but you know better than to tackle me on what I'm thinking on that point because on that point I got it right you know I'm in the in the right mood on that point see so then you know let's don't lock down now church on one thing and not move on into others and the people have done it literally on saying the grace of marriage and divorce and they never thought that he was talking anything about their old husband of organized religion all it was is just straight down the line the way people think that's right marriage and divorce Grace they don't see that he was talking about organized religion and how we were married to that what was the reason marriage and divorce had to be [Music] preached what do we read this morning what is in marriage and divorce there when it's coming down what because of misinterpreted theology because of our old husbands right right that are still alive our old denominational ideas amen oh no they won't put up a sign on a church in this message and say we denominated it but brother R said they'll organize it in the lady OA right do you know that they is just one step between organize and denominate that's just one step between the two between an organization or a denomination all right so then listen to what I'm saying if it takes me longer I don't mind waiting on Wednesday or waiting on y if you want to stay at 5:00 this afternoon whatever you want to do it doesn't really matter to me because I just try my best to present what I can to you get you to see and get you to think see most people never they don't even think that they have to have a spiritual application to their their marriage and divorce their old husband their old denominational husband's still alive that's right yep and all that takes is our ideas that's right and see if I stand right here now you just probably you won't like this statement which is all right but if me or any preacher stands and proves by the word of God that something that you used to believe is wrong and you stay with that wrong your old husband is still alive okay now that's how do you know that you know how do you know that you know your old denominational husband is dead right [Music] cuz if he's still alive he'll show his head right the old boy is going to come around every once in a while and he's going to show his so then I believe we need a spiritual application a greater portion than he gave in The Invisible Union of marriage and divorce I believe we need the greater portion right to be able to come to a position to where we can walk out of this Earth Amen in these bodies we're in amen right without taking to death that's right so easy to understand that if you die you die that's right yeah I mean my daddy died in 1945 he you can't write down on something that he killed somebody 2 days ago or a week ago or something you know it's just just foolishness to think but you know our old husband can be dead that we just hung him up in a closet you never heard people say this I know so and so but I've got my own idea right yes I got my own idea well let me translate that back about 6,000 years ago when there was a lady said that you don't don't uh I know I talk wrong Sor sorry you think Eve didn't think it was wrong to have a relationship with that Beast there's something wrong with your mentality if you think that she didn't her first thoughts was strictly against that now come on she was pure and holy and virtuous and righteous and everything see don't matter if you want to say it with eating an apple it still be that sure you know she thought about it but see then after a while that that new husband standing there begin to inject his idea into her that's right and as he did she wound up doing the natural act right I don't say she was a filthy garbage can no she become that so now we got to get back so let's let's go on see if we can so then remember now we're talking about a greater portion of marriage and divorce coming from the opening of the scriptures we're talking about the natural marriage and divorce the grace the new birth to bring us to Christ the the marriage and divorce situation to set us physically free and the the greater portion of marriage and divorce involved in the invisible Union of our old denominational husbands got to be dead that's right and in doing that then we're seeing that it's a a mystery of a setting in order of the Prophecies of the scripture the prophet said that we just read amen right do you think Moses law now as I said something this morning about the the thing uh Moses the the grace he gave when Paul came along why didn't Paul just repeat Moses see because Paul's message was a greater portion right right deeper depth higher level more word Moses was a natural Paul was a natural and spiritual application Amen to be married to Christ that's right all right what do you think in this end time it is to be married to Christ the word all right in our headship see to unite all right now in doing it it sets in order the scriptures see the prophecy of the the mystery sets in order the scriptures in other words it's lining up the scriptures but now you remember what I said I said Moses Grace that Paul couldn't just quote Moses our brother Brandon quoting Paul that's right it had to be something personal to each individual to bring the grace that's and and Moses Grace was not sufficient in the days of Paul right or Paul would have requoted Moses that's right neither would it be of Mo of Paul's Grace to be sufficient or p r would have quoted Paul that's right you understand each one of them kept unfolding into a deeper portion of the word are the setting and Order of the scriptures bringing it to a place to see now watch this part though Moses Grace was the word of God the alive word the supernatural Revelation that spoke that's right right the Christ speaking through Moses you agree all right well then see it couldn't be a different thing then right I tried to use the words if I don't use my words correctly forgive me I don't how the education Moses's Grace wouldn't have been sufficient for Paul it had to be more cuz there's more word unveiling but Moses's Grace was speaking of the grace that Paul brought that's right are you listening it was speaking of that that Paul brought into being all right so would Paul's message then of the grace speak of the end time when the prophet would bring the grace so it can't be something different right amen Paul's Grace wasn't something different from Moses right brother around his grace that we just talking using those terms wouldn't something different from Moses and Paul it was greater portion right deeper depth greater things had to come into being Paul wasn't concerned with a change of a body that's right it wasn't time that's right Moses wasn't concerned with a body change right we're concerned with a body change here in the end time see all right are you following me then yes see now let's start doing that then with that in the background to to read a little go ahead to number two brother this is paragraph 56 and 57 of the invisible union now watching the prophet Paul is saying that a woman cannot remarry until her first husband is dead she cannot remarry as long as her first husband is living all right she by no circumstances at all okay we've been through all of this right yes she must remain single as long as her her first husband is living all right we even went through you know that she could say well you know like this lady trying to collect insurance over here on the Bel and Bridge Road you know through that area back to there over the lake you know she wanted to collect insurance so she had somebody to bump her old man off and she collected Insurance didn't do her much good cuz they got her in jail now going to you trying to for murder cuz they found out cuz she happened to make some cell phone calls from over there and claim she wouldn't over there see they're getting smart now so you know but now listen by no circumstances at all she must remain single as long as her first husband is living right and if she should do such a sin she shall be called an adulterous now watch I'm speaking of the natural atype it with the spiritual if this woman would commit such a sin then she is marked an adulterous if she has two living husbands at the same time therefore she has forfeited by doing their her rights to God in heaven read what he saying by doing so she sure has she is an outcast from the economy of God according to the scripture that I've just read so is the church when she tries to mix Creed and denomination with the word of God she can't be married to a denomination and be the bride of Christ at the the same time she's got to be dead to one or the other the law says so here there's plenty of laws in God's word and that's his law Paul speaking the same thing she cannot be married to a church a worldly Creed and be the bride of Christ because she one is contrary to the other now remember right so now tying it together with the natural the spiritual the new birth and following that line all right watch the next one go ahead cuz we got a lot of reading to do all right progress 71 72 I have to keep up with these I get on the wrong parts of it paragraph 71 now she is a woman if she married to if she is married to Christ the word she cannot be married to a church denomination at the same time she's Bound for she's Bound by it she shall cannot live with both husbands at the same time they're contrary one to the other one is God sent the other is man-made so they're contrary said let every man's word be a lie mine be the truth God said that just as much contrary to one another as law was to Grace as Paul Paul's speaking of here one must be dead to have the other and if she tries to mix them she shall be called an adultery oh think of it New York Arizona Across the Nation think of it God said if she tried to be married to two at the same time she shall be called an adulterous what adulterous can enter Heaven would God marry an adulterous certainly not he asked us not to do it she shall be called an adulterous all right now we've got to get down to understand and follow the lineup right now so we see that she he must be dead I mean the husband he's got to be dead there's no grounds now the three things we're talking of in the New Birth we will be reading in a minute about the world and the things and how that we came married to the world our old husband the world all right see and to be born again you must die to yourself right he'll be born again all right then in the point that we're talking about the the grace of marriage and divorce and we see the natural marriage and divorce or what it is right that her husband must be dead right all right now remember folks when we're talking the women think we're only picking on them remember the bride of Christ is is man and woman okay so the man might Str around about I got my grace straightened [Music] out well what about your old husband the denomination still alive that's I left that a long time ago brother M had a good statement he said you get your coat and hat and you leave that's was a good way of saying you get your coat and hat and you leave and you go to another place you hang your coat and hat up right see not a not an old just to hang him up in the closet none of that can be done right got to be dated so is it now with the invisible Union before there can be an invisible Union there's got to be a death to her old husband right amen now try to keep them all together okay let's see where are we number let's go on to number four right so now watching now as I said keep all three things in mind cuz you're going to get mixed up in when he starts talking to see what he's talking about but he's going to be talking about the New Birth he's going to be talking about adoptions or whatever you want to call it but not using the word words you know the grow developed in the stature of perfect man and he's going to be talking about our natural life right that's why it's so hard to break this down to get you to see the thing that comes over here at the end of it all right look what he said paragraph 134 and 136 135 136 that's all together out of the reaches for for her she don't want that oh no sir no indeed what does she do then so she brings forth a power a painted face shorts wearing Jezebel Society illegitimate cats they call them I think it's see I think they call it cats look at that cat going there they say or something like that you know she was born or married connected with her first husband Adam you know first husband the first Adam now he talking naturally now right but remember naturally is naturally as far as going into the natural parts and it's natural into what we're doing in the new birth right because it's showing where we come from she was born or married connected with her first husband the first Adam by the adulterous wife of Eve Adam's first wife I like putting that in there but I didn't you know some people read that and say brother you add you better go look at the book he want said Adam's first wife you say adulterous she sure was but oh she claims that this Adam this first Adam is [Music] dead oh sure he died a long time ago I'm reborn again she said and I'm certainly married to the second Adam Christ the word now is there a denomination anywhere in the message outside the message anywhere okay that says they're not married to the second Adam which the second Adam is Christ right first Adam was made a living Soul the second Adam was a quickening spirit right is there any church that would say that they're not married to the word what's wrong some wrong somewhere cuz God's word surely is not mixed that up you know that much mixed up I'm sorry it's just not watch now he talking about he talking about I'm reborn again she says that doesn't the basis of the religious World claim to be born again that's right I mean isn't that the key point of all religions whether it be you walk down the aisle and you say a whole bunch of Creeds or you you do a certain things or or you you do certain things for three or four months you know all kind of churches has got things in it that they call a new birth that's right now how can all that be so mixed up I thought there was just one New Birth you know I didn't know that there was all kind of new births no I thought the new birth was the birth of the word now so follow me he's talking about her first Adam to be born again your first Adam has got to be dead that's right we'll get to it in a minute on a direct quote where brother says your first Adam the world that's right so to be born again your old nature that's right must die that's right right to be born again that's right you got to go through justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost to be born again so that means your old husband is dead right now if not you're not born again right all right now but just because you're born again does that do away with all of your thinking all of your organizational isms Etc no we didn't even know we needed to get rid of all of them we all thought Glory Hallelujah they somewhere they're pretty good and they fit somewhere in the crowd you know and oh no now we know that these people got their weird ideas and they got their weird ideas and we got weird ideas but we're all going to the same place that might be true we might all wind up in the same place it may be hot there little cold for some of you years today now get you the life where to clear up things in your mind watch now where he starts off paragraph 136 so he's talking about the new bird right come down what does he say notice what she loves watch her lover now these for a little bit will be tied up into churches situations but it'll be tied up with like the old nature and situation and dying to that and getting born again the word says but she said my church says this then who then who she in love with who is her husband her own fruits prove what she is exactly right shows what she is notice she was born first to Adam because that's her natural nature so now we're still on the new birth see and she never left that now I've done said two or three keys in what I've said that when you come over and we keep going and then I hope your mind will click back and he said that and he said that to be born again your old husband must be dead that's true right you're not born again if the old nature of the world is still alive that's right now how did that old nature die well I just quit I I just quit doing them things well why you still doing it right it's all his problem and see there's a key all the way through here yes because see to be born again God had to let that's right your old husband Adam die that's right that's right or your soul is not born again that's right now if I was you I'd write that down and notice how many times I'll make that statement that God let that die that's right amen I just keep that in my mind yes we'll come back to it amen see PR her fruit shows what she is exactly right shows what she is notice she was born first to Adam cuz that's her natural birth see and she never left that right that's a lover of the world right she claims she is born with this born the second time to Christ but her lover notices Adam right yet because she loves the world Amen now you know what the Bible said you love the world the things of the world the love of the fathers not any in other words Translating that if you love The the world and things of the world you're don't you're not born again that's right now that doesn't mean we can't go out here and do this that doesn't mean that see you get under that and people their minds they locked off right then about probably half of you did right about that time and what do you mean you know okay open up we'll talk about it a second get it cleared up it doesn't mean that we are not living in this world it doesn't mean that we don't work for a living it doesn't mean that we don't do the thing of life that is not worldism that's right that is what we've got to do to make a living and we got to have a home we got to have a car we got to have a job that's right okay right I know see I probably when I get into that maybe I shouldn't explain that brother told me years ago he said you explain things too much well I don't leave no loopholes so now all computers clicked off and come back on to where I'm at brains you know we're not talking about the world it's okay for us to go out here and go to a cafe and eat supper that's right but I do stay away from the ones if I can that's got all the beer sitting out and all of the things I said if I can because you can't all way if you're going to eat you're going to find garbage that's true all right but don't call that whism that's right because that you like a three-piece suit and I like a two-piece suit he's a centner he likes three piece I to none of that all right get it down see because she loves the world right now today is Sunday to express something how many people this afternoon in follows this message you know that it's getting to be a popular thing that they only having one Sunday service right in the people of this message well if I didn't have no more to preach what they do I probably wouldn't want but one one every 3 week honest right sarcasm okay but you know yourself you check around you'll find out a lot of the the churches are now having one possibly two Services a week some will have a Wednesday night Thursday night or whatever night you know they'll have one and then they'll have a Saturday night or they'll have a Wednesday night and a Sunday morning service and that's their business that ain't nothing to n me and you but it's just a point that's right when we are supposed to be getting the word filled into us daily and Desiring to eat daily and then we don't want to have church right how many churches in this message following it are out this afternoon playing sports you know gone out into ball games in the time now you're medling their lives now okay I like to medal but it's serious righten I don't go hunting on Sund I know the rules and the regulations of the Prophet but I've never broke them I made a promise of the Lord myself he said if you're out in the woods and not able to go to church he said go ahead and Hunt I don't do it I've took my gun and I'll take my gun if me and you down there hunting and you want to go ahead and Hunt I'll take my gun and go in my Bible and go sit down up against the tree I'll take my gun because I ain't going to kill nothing but I don't want nothing to kill me either okay I st the gun go set up against a tree I've done that you know and just wait on the rest of them you know uh one year we tagged out and parents and Nanny with the last two way and I had been tagged out on our deer about years ago and uh I would take those two and go with them andour a pistol to her be my protection and go put them on the deer stand and go set up against a tree somewhere and read my Bible why because I believe in doing what the prophet says he said did I say it right not on Sunday not on Sunday no no I never have honey on Sunday I don't believe I I've made that commitment now if we out there and we're hungry that's a different time okay we're hungry don't come up one of these days said Brother D Sunday we can't kill nothing today just get out of the way I'm going to give me something to eat but I told a man at work one time he said what are you going to do when they tighten down on you I said well I got a bucket and I got a gun and I got some sticks and what do you mean I said well first off I'll probably go milk the neighbor's C get me some milk take a gun and go kill me a an animal you know and I got something to make me a fire with all right get all that so get you the life to get back seriousness part but to understand what I'm saying it's not worly to be of life that we live that's right but it's worldly when we put in front of people that it's okay to go do things that's right that are not according to what ought to be done right right and I I've made the statements of brother Brown he said if you're out there go ahead but I just never done it cuz that's just me I want to be we we used to fish brother mol and brother Bill Cunningham and I used to fish years ago and we'd be out on Saturday night well 12:00 came we took our rods and reels and laid them in the boat told what bait we had to over if we going to get rid of it whatever we would be there 2:00 or 3: in the morning just sitting there talking never fishing another fish why because the prophets said don't do it so we just didn't do it now you say well you calling me world because I do that no the the word does Prophet does now what we argue about it is no problem I'm just saying you got to work for a living and you your job requires you to work Sunday you work on Sunday but if you can get you a job to keep you from working on Sunday don't work on Sunday that's that's you know that's as much as I can say to you cuz there's some jobs required that you work on Sunday right and you can't have it so we're we're not something to say bless God quit your job cuz you're working on Sunday no you don't have to make a living it's hard to find a job now but it's like brother Tom used to say I think I won't call the name where he was at church but brother used to say and this brother toen said if you're working on Sunday to bring more money into this church you come to church on Sunday sit on the Pew and I'll give you money right and it was a good point right brother Tom went in told him he wasn't working the morning on Sunday right and he was cutting down 11 11 and 1/2 hours a day which amounted to somewhere in the neighborhood of probably $300 or four that he would make in that one day you just understand see sometimes we got to make things and find out what life is okay now we're trying to get out of all of that now watch and another thing watch notice what kind of children she's buing now watch this situation and let's call it whism I see a lot of the people in this message that they us go to church when they want to well how can you blame your kids coming up under you I mean can you can you say anything about their life if if you doing it in front of them I no that hurts feelings but that's that's all right I love you so I hope you love me but now see that's that's what kind of children are is she bearing you you watch this church right over here and you'll see that they bu the same kind of children the way they dress and what they wear is handed down to their children right see then that can be worldism see the old husband can still well be alive it could be a sign that you're not even born again that's right see what kind of a children is she bearing that tells what their papa is whether it's the first Adam or second Adam if the church brings forth a child of the second Adam now the second Adam if a church bring forth a child of the second Adam which is Christ all right he acts the second Adam's way of acting like they did on the day of Pentecost right if you're true born again Christian you're going to follow the word right right yes sir that's the really true second Adam's children see right their nature is like his and hers yes sir her daughters no what he dring back to the other point what yes sir her daughter's painted face bed ha wearing men's clothes and trousers the Bible said for her not to do it she cuts her heart it's a shame to her we done been through the thing and he says then shut up cuz he was out there in Louisiana streetport Louisiana and he said you say shut up he said but in other words that's what the word says that's right they couldn't argue with him on that but they wanted him to hush all right okay let's go to the next [Music] one see you'll notice there's only sometimes just a paragraph or two in between the one to the next one this paragraph 151 through 150 three I guess or something now notice the Bible clly says here that her first husband must be dead not just put away he's like to be dead now trying to get back to all of the three things the situation of all of the three things that we were talking about the New Birth the marriage and divorce the invisible Union the qualifications is the same for all three right the old husband must be dead watch now now if I was you I'd look at that statement right there and I'd say well that man is meaning something because he darkened out that I had that underlined in then circular and brother uh Anderson him picked it up and I like that watch what he's talking about now do you think he's not talking about marriage and divorce or anything else he just don't what notice the Bible plainly says here that the first husband must be dead not just put away he's got to be dead I just got to preaching on marriage and divorce and you know you all know about that I'm not speaking now all together this congregation here but Across the Nation all right now you see what happened there I'd write that down and if I fail to bring it out somebody asked me a question what did you mean you see what happened there told it to be a key now you see what happened there in marriage and divorce something happened there and how did it happen when it the Seven Seals were open that brought out the real truth of it you remember this morning if the seals hadn't broke to the prophet he couldn't have preached marriage and divorce right all right so write that down and hold it so be married to the second Adam Christ the word you must separate yourself by Death from your first denominational husband now he's moved up into a stage right I a talking about your denominational husband he ain't just solely talking about the New Birth he's got on to the stage of your denominational husband MH cuz there isn't a one of them that can take all the word of God just show me where that one is at oh you say mine you say Lula okay the other fell says his too put them together and you find out you're both wrong soon as you denominate read Revelation 17 so you see you got to be dead from that thing now I'm not speaking to this local assembly I'm speaking all together Across the Nation you must be dead to your first husband right if you're United to Christ and still married to a denomination you're an adulterous you are Lady of sea now he's not talking about just a new birth right that's right I'm hoping you're going to follow this through the message then you can take the book and just sit down and read it and you might do it with all books if you try to do it sometime that's true is to see what the man's talking about so watch it a church across the nation we're following Jesus Christ the word to be in the bride now he's still up there in that organiz religion Point watch it to be in the bride you have to be remarried to the word of God which is Christ that's right Amen in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us amen as long as you hold to man's tradition of denominations right you are called in God's word and adulterous as long as you're a denominational Creed Seeker belong to a denominational church that denies the word you're an adulterous what the Bible says amen now he's up in the higher than just your new birth right that's right come on Jesus said you cannot serve two Gods at the same time you either serve God or Mamon mamam is the world right heard that preached a million times in the Baptist Church but they call Mamon money he that loves the world are the things of the world the love of God is not even in right the seed of God cannot be in him the same time the love of God in other words seed of God the love of God the love of the world is in there you can't be there at the same time same time the love of the world same time the seat of God can't be at the same time with the world in there that's right when the seat of God is operating through you that's the word of God the love of the world can't be in there at the same time now where is the short High and the shorts and the painted faces now where is it at you see see what he's getting yes see where it's coming to yes and I see I know for certain I ain't going to get nowhere wrong what I want it to but we'll try to get another one or two let's see if we can all right let's fall back we jumped up talking about in these quotes talking about denominationalism let's get back we just moved over to paragraph 212 let's get this and then we'll try to we'll quit on this CU we'll just cover the new birth all now I'm going to be covering now is everybody listening I'm only going to be covering in this quote about the New Birth okay I am not going to be talking about the grace of marriage and divorce I am not going to be talking about invisible Union I'm going to be talking about the new birth amen cuz that's what he's doing that's why brother Brown could talk about the new birth and be talking about organized religion he could be talking about this and be over here and is totally gone from people that don't have a revelation that's right because they wonder what in the world he's talking about cuz he just went to organize religion now he's going to flop back to the New Birth okay what paragraph 221 now was nature associated with death your first husband that who had rule over you was your Nature by natural birth now there is coming up the husband being the world the natural thing right the first Adam brother Mo used to preach his he preach a message he called him are you married to Adam or Christ right now had rule over you your Nature by natural birth natural you love the world because you are the world and part of the world that's right congregation says amen your desires was by nature to love the world which you're a part of you're a part of nature you believe that amen and that's your natural thing that's the reason you have to be born again you have to separate you have to die to that first husband amen you can't live with it that's right you just can't say well I'll divorce him and hang him up here till occasion no sir no writing a divorcement he dies the nature of the world has to die every spec of him has to die you have to be reunited again with another nature that's right all right so the nature of the world has to die right now how did the nature of the world you're trying to get born again how did the nature of the world die y right justification sanctification right right amen cleanses the soul to make it free you die to your own self that's right right so now we making a statement it's going to be later in here that we'll see it won't be today God let it die right that's right the only way you could ever be born again you explain to me how you got born again right you explain to me one day you was a sinner out in the world and and died in sin and the next day you would head to church amen you explain that something had to die that old adamic nature that's that's right had to die now I want to see how far I can go 152 okay we'll just finish up we'll finish one or two more then we'll quit now watching your name and your first nature was born and put in a Book of Life all your Deeds remember that for later on all your Deeds was wrote in it right cuz the book of life is not the loue book of life right okay not two books two sections of one book that's right all right so it was wrote in there so then in the second stage of it coming up to the spiritual our old denominational husband is still wrote in there as long as we got that idea he still wrote there that's right right you still alive that's right and then you can claim all you want to third stage that I believe the prophet's message right I was married before or whatever it is and I accepted it and now I'm free but you ever look around try to find out where that old man's at now I don't mean anything wrong with this I mean the truth I've tried to explain it I was in the world yes I'm sorry but I never did ask early Marin that was one thing for sure wouldn't do and I would in no way in the world have anything to do with married women I would not that was just part of me and I told you I confessed to my wife before we married she asked me one day something about I said look honey I wish every girl and have food was sit get to church today and let me preach to him the love of Jesus Christ to get him saved amen she said could you do that yeah I do it I said I want to ask you a question I said suppose they get born again and they're coming to church could you put your arms around him and call him sister she said yes see that means a lot about your old husband right I know people would differ with me and say well no I'd have these bad ideas I thought we're supposed to pray right amen about these bad ideas I'm a human moral I have bad ideas cuz there's no problem old say and goes with the bird that flies over your head it's when you allow it to nest in your heart you can't help but think wrong right but you can keep from thinking on the thinking of thinking wrong that's right or not you mean you couldn't stand before a a person that You' been immoral with them and you're a Christian and you wouldn't want them people saved I'm sorry that you know if that don't that offend you I'm sorry cuz it's just that's just me that's the way I am cuz see I want that old denominational husband to be so dead that I don't have him alive no more I want him dead God's the only one that can let him die that's right all right so then all of our things watch let's see where your name of your nature was born and put in the Book of Life all your Deeds was wrote in it too everything you done under that nature was put in a book called The Book of Life now remember the Book of Life is the natural life that we live upon the Earth and and everybody's written in there of the natural life that they live now as one quote the prophet gives you the word that is not even written nowh which means it didn't even account to be being want to be written but that's all right now but it's put in the book of life that's different from the Lamb's Book of Life it's a different section of the same book so we got to see it transferred well I come here with mine in that book of life well I come in here a dirty messed up garbage can what about you me too I want to see it transferred myself now you notice in Daniel when he comes to the Ancient of Days whose her was his white as wolf 10,000 time 10,000 came with him to to him the the the bride and then the books and then the books were open see books books not one books one is Book of Life books and another book was open which was The Book of Life see there is Saints already there in the church the bride already the bride another book was open which was the book of life now but now you but when you you were separated from that Union by spiritual death listen your natural Desir is to cut your heart your natural desires to wear shorts paint your face your natural desire to be intellectual smart men know something better than the other that's what he wanted that's the very things you wanted well you say you little 2x4 preacher there and tell me I got a PhD that just means you're further away from God every time you add one thing see see that's the right is true true all right let's just get to the next one I think we'll quit on that part all right pull me back down just a there you go that's what eve took she was pregnated with that kind of a pregnation right now Eve was pregnated with that kind of pregnation that's why you need a new birth right now watch that and that's the church today the church today is the same as eeve Bible school didn't ual and look everyone disagreeing with the other one a big mess just exactly what the Bible said Babylon now she was pregnated with that kind of pregnation now in the natural Eve was pregnated with the seed from the Beast right right okay but brother Brown said before that that natural act took place that Satan entered her thinking ability and when he entered that thinking ability and she started making choices and things she come out to be a denominational prostitute he said it wouldn't even done back up right I agree with you it would even back there around and said all denominations come out of Genesis now that's his wor all right so then hold on to what I'm thinking about and what I'm trying to get you to see and we'll try to continue Wednesday that the three things the new birth you got to see that you're dead right right and find out how you die that's right right and I gave you the key about three times all right how do you die see come up to the next of the natural state of marriage and divorce that old husband has got to be dead that's right now whether it be husband or wife in that natural right right death the only separation come on then the third is the greater portion of marriage and divorce the old denominational husband has got to be dead cuz if he ain't [Music] dead he's still there to be played around with those ideas in our minds has got to be dead now read invisible Union read it real careful and think of those three things in one message that your Prophet is covering three things yes and then you'll see what takes place you'll see what he said look what happened there on the marriage and divorce see only God can take care of anything all right let's Stand Together We Go end of the communion we won't have any we just have a we just sing brother sing I love you or something and we'll before we go into the communion if anybody hasn't read or anything that they want to you know get rid of anything and come and let's believe it and accept it before we have the communion and get everything in the correct order so let's just sing that if anybody has a need whatever then let's get it out of the way before we have the communion okay I love you I love you he first L me and just [Applause] Sal one more I love you I love because he first me and just my Sal on [Music] amen let's just read your scripture Paul in 1 Corinthians 11th chapter verse 23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had s saying this cup is the new Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do sh the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat t one for another If any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together into condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come the prophet said what they were doing they were just eating and just turning around and just taking the communion they called it that's why he said you know if you're hungry eat at home that's what they were doing there see it wasn't something they were just having a meal in other words and then they just they just flop over and take the communion and just it wasn't sacred or nothing he said don't do that eat it home come together take communion we said to T one for another so let's just pray one for another the Lord would bless and guide each and every one of us bless each and every one go we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen the Bible said he took bread and blessed it father we thank you for this bread that's been made for this purpose this afternoon and we come to this place now to to partake we know that this is not your body it's not a round wafer it's a bread that we break and we believe it is made special by special hands Lord and made of a special ingredients to where it doesn't have anything in it we thank you because it's speaking of your word that Lord was there your body because you were the word made flesh now we ask ask you to sanctify this bread into partakers Lord just help us to think about your word as we partake of this bread and think about you what you've done for us sanctify the bread and the partakers in Jesus name [Music] amen see we think a lot of times we say well and I am glad of it but we say we we've learned the truth we're not like the rest of them people that got that old wafer and you can order right out of books and places now a little thing that it's got a little round wafer looking thing on the top of it little covering on it and it's got wine in it and they're throw away cups you know it's not wine it's grape juice and you know probably some people would send you actually wine in it I'm sure you could order it if you wanted but see that's not exactly you know the way that it should be but we The Bread is made and made the day that you partake of it and destroyed the night before the night is over of what's left the wine the it's not just a grape juice cuz grape juice will s but you just partake of the wine it means his blood but in that season you if we think that we're doing it right thank God for doing it right but do we just glory and blood in that well we're not like the rest of them we do it this way well why or whatever you know what would be the the point I wouldn't I wouldn't take communion and I've told you that if I was a place you know that they had grape juice and soda cracker style I wouldn't do it I just wouldn't make no s no say I ain't going to do it you know no just pass it on and just leave it alone because there is a lot to do with it the blood the wine see symbol of the blood but it's not the blood that bread is not the body it's just symbol of it right see we take it for that father we thank you for this wine that's went through the process of aging and now gets better as we each day we see it Lord because it speaks of your blood that was shed for each and every one of us we love you and we thank you sanctify the wine and the partakers together in one in you in Jesus name amen come morning I rest me the evere car my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me sometimes I'm despise and reject and I question father then I take one more look at M calary and it gives me the strength to come morning I by the river our Green Tree I'll car my cross through the midnight come morning glor just think about what was taking place that night that he took the bread and he blessed it and gave it out that this is my body take eat took the wine handed it out and said this is my blood we know that was he was saying it was an example but an example's got a lot to do with it like we talking about this morning a type you know a type or something a little boat is a type of a big ocean liner boat you know but you know the little boat's able to travel and let do you know how close was he when he was to saying this is my blood this is my body but not saying it in literal other words not meaning it to be literally the body and literally the blood but to be an example and then when we get there first meal is going to be what going to be the communion marriage supper going to be the communion the prophet said we'll sit down and look across a table said
