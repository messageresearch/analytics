light your glory pour out your power and love as we say oh he's amen good to be in the house of the lord good to see everybody i thought sitting back there a while ago i thought that's pretty good singing for a fella that back a few years ago was underneath the water for they don't really know how long and then they had to get him out and they had to bring all the equipment out to try to help him and everything you know but he was standing in the water with his hands up and his brother had to finally get him back in the boat and everything else to get back over to him so i thought that's pretty good singing amen look at this thank the lord and just you like turn in your scriptures turn where we've been reading revelations 1 and we will read revelations 5 and trying to move on a little bit into the book of revelation remember the lord willing brother dale smith will be preaching for us wednesday so be much in prayer for him and the bible study will be uh this coming saturday at six o'clock what was what's the topic this time when we i forgot producing them introducing the message yeah kind of how to introduce the message okay all right i forgot what we had for a topic anyhow revelations 1 and revelations 5. our heavenly father we thank you for an opportunity this afternoon to come together thank you for your word lord thank you for you and the hour that we're living thank you for the opportunity that you've given unto us the time that you've allowed us lord to live upon the earth and for the time that you've given us to be able to store up the word to into our hearts that must be ready against that day we love you and we thank you we ask you now to you just come and speak to our hearts and as we speak to your people you come and speak to their hearts and then we don't have to worry about the manifestation because it will be there you said you sent your word and healed us and we thank you for that and just deliver us from destruction and lord we we thank you in all things and jesus is your name i know the other day when i didn't hear all the story but uh uh lisa and her brother was in a truck pulling some putting some stuff the other day and the trailer came unhooked you know and if they hadn't been where they were and all of this that and the other no telling how long it went that away you know it could have been very dangerous could have went out in front of somebody or whatever it could have been but we thank god for being there to do it now because he's he's ever present with us all right revelations 1 the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel to and to his servant john who by record of the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw thus it is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written they're in for the time is at hand now let's go over we were in chapter 4 this morning which in no way in the world did we cover anything but we were just covering the voice of the archangel you know and the the resurrection and things and then this afternoon we want to get on to chapter five and see some of the things that john saw all right and i saw in the right hand of him that said on the throne a book written within on the backside seal with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look their own now brother branham in the seal book especially covers it all of the prophets the different sages the different people down through time were all there but nobody was worthy he said that the uh michael that he was worthy but said he wasn't a man that was christ and so in that form you know he said gabriel was but he wasn't he wasn't a man so it had to be something connected to man see because it said in verse one and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book needed to look their own and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look their own and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the line of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and i be held in low in the midst of the throne and then the four beasts and then the midst of the elder stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that set upon the throne you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now we we tried to cover this morning that i said we just just barely hit a little bit of the fourth chapter and you know because i'm trying to move on and you know and just kind of give us a layout and of what we're looking at and what's taking place you know and is to take place and to see all of that you know in the scriptures but i was thinking this morning as i was reading it see i try to bring something i bring a lot of notes and in these notes if you would just take the note and read it and then read the next quote the next quote the next quote the next quote i try to line them up that brother branham makes every point that i'm saying everything that i'm point i'm trying to make he makes that statement and that's where i get it from you know but hopefully you will see how it all lines up together and just let it be we could just take it and bring it off of the message you know and then turn on the tape recorder and let him play let him speak each one of them because that's what's happening amen now did you understand what i'm talking about this morning now that the uh the voice of the archangel how that voice of the arctic angel is christ and michael the scripture calling him the archangel we know is christ now not jesus because that's the you're putting in the wrong place but the christ thing all right and the christ is the son of the living god okay jesus was the man on earth that that christ dwelt in and being that then he was in the office of the prophet as we were talking about so he was called the son of man all right now brother branham is not we'll get to it in a minute he's not the son of man he is a son of man brother branham you know he couldn't be our lord and savior he couldn't be that one now you know a lot of people believe that that he was just that's fine i you know yourself and i i hope that there's nobody in the world would ever think that brother brother dale didn't give all the honor and glory to to the prophet of god that it was bring the message caught or read it to you from him i don't claim it to be i could just go through and just preach a sermon like a lot of people do and i'm not against that i'm just my ministry but you know a lot of people just preach a message across you don't know whether or not they're right or what's going on because you have no way of checking it other than trying to remember on your own whether that be that away or not but you know i i pray that you would just you know take it home and study it all right see we talked about the son of man then being the ministry of the lord jesus christ and that in that ministry that he had the voice of the resurrection the and he had the the sign of jonah you know and that's the voice of the resurrection not that's necessarily jesus would be there three days and three nights he was but not like we want to counter times and get all confused and and then we spend all our time staying on that subject and instead of seeing what the real truth of it was he had the resurrection sign he could heal the sick he could raise the dead like brother dick was talking about after service then the disciples even their ministry they could heal the sick and things but there was things they couldn't do because they did not have that ministry to do that they were not the son of man and you see in the last days that you and i us ministers we have our ministry and the things and the gifts of god but we're not responsible for what the prophet was to bring the message unto us you know the word see we have ours we have our gifts we have you know i believe in healing and signs and wonders and all of that i believe that's in the bride of christ around the world i believe in that but there's not one of us persons see they can stand up and do like brother branham did see i'll guarantee you healing for your 24 worst cases because we wouldn't have the backup authority from almighty god but i believe around the world in the bride of jesus christ that the ministry of jesus christ is here amen i believe the son of man ministry the resurrection ministry is here and that was what i was trying to bring out that the son of man being the voice then that raised lazarus and would be the voice that would raise the dead and then the end time then amen all right so what are we trying to do get the word here it was brought by the prophet all right but he was not the son of man but he's part of the son of man because the bride of jesus christ will be the fullness of the godhead bodily your prophet said and also it will be the son of man all right because that's where the resurrection's coming from and you say well why is the resurrection taking place because we're not in our right place that's right it's sensible right that's where we need to each one find our place right but we need to get into adoption and and try to find our place and not somebody else's place you know get to the position we're supposed to be in and then god can take care of it and then all the way around the world it's going to be a resurrection it's not just going to be in lulu georgia and everybody's got to come to lula you know we've never talked nothing like that it's going to be around the world in the bride of jesus christ and see that that voice will be in her because she will be the under her messenger she will be the final voice to the final age in other words the voice of the resurrection is going to come from the bride now it's not going to be that we're going to all get together and go out and holler dead come up no no it's just going to be when we become the word the dead will come among us because we will then have the voice of the resurrection calling her out of the grave all right now you say well why haven't we why well brother branham's in the grave we got to call him out whatever you believe will happen when he gets here whatever you believe you still got to go with one thing right he's waiting on us you say well no no he just waiting on time well time has to do with us just put it that way on it but see that's that's where we're at all right because that son of man is the voice of the resurrection he proved it by raising the dead to doing the things now all right now so let's move on into it see she must become the son of man which is the word made flesh in this day right all right now brother adam is part of that right right do we know the word was in him because he brought the word that's sensible you know he brought the word unto us all right he done his part now he's resting waiting on you and i to become the word that he brought right that's that's that's no problem all right we'll see brother brown then and we want to get on this just keep putting this message with the morning's message brother branham was not the son of man see because he wasn't the lord jesus christ we don't believe in that now but we believe that he was the prophet that god used to bring us the message right amen we believed that but let's just get into it and just read a little bit now as i said then just read one two three four five and then and if you'll just read them in order sometimes you'll you'll see that uh you know it's just following right through what the prophet had to say all right so on the message anointed once the end times 65 25 the morning service paragraph 258 he says in the very day that the son of man is revealed revelations 10 1 through 7. let's see he puts it over to the earth we'll get over there one day and bring it out maybe on it but see read it when you get home the seventh angel's message that's it opening of the seals now what's the seventh angel's message opening of the seals it was not in the years of preparation and all that it was opening of the seals all right now watch what is it not the angel is the son of man but the messenger is revealing the son of man can you get it separated now he says that's where it seems to be so hard for you you see not the son of man himself but the seventh angel the seventh messenger is revealing to the public the son of man now watch because it's left to shuck now remember that in a minute because mary is the shook mary's pentecostal shuck that's not against her and we'll get to all of that in a minute because it's left to shuck he can't organize it it's the grain itself again right all right now and in the day that that day jackson james will withstand anointed ones make believers and unbelievers church former and the pentecostals stand up against the true grain but let them alone their folly be made manifest as theirs was you understand all right now what is it he's revealing the son of man he is not the son of man he's the seventh angel of course in the message now they got it all so revelated see the the son of the the seventh church age messenger was was back here and then he come on over here and he become god over here well that's like river jordan when they got jesus becoming god so that's all right that's their business all i'm doing is just trying to get what little group listening to me and get us prepared because i'm not preparing trying to prepare everybody around the world it's what's here all right now then look at the next one now let's get into this just a minute because he says there in the quote we just read he said it's the grain itself again all right now let's read that while we're right on that that's in uh john john 12. let's read what he's talking about the grain yeah huh verse 23 24 and jesus answered them saying the hour is come that the son of man should be glorified now it goes on down through a whole lot over here but i'm just wanting to pick out the part we're talking about now watch jesus 21st 24th verse verily verily i say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit all right now that was the only way as i said this morning that you could get into the kingdom of god or the throne of god or the domain of god was what jesus christ would have to die to release the life all right then it would come back on the day of pentecost to begin the the bride of jesus christ which would be the the grain of wheat that would be coming forth all right but we also know that in that that it did not fulfill it completely because that grain of wheat would have to go into the ground so that's what you see you see about four church ages and the full word of god mature word was going into the ground there and as it did then you see luther coming out with the two little shoots the sprouts and then you see wesley coming on up for the shuck and then you i mean the uh the tonsils and then you see the pentecostals coming up to be the show now it's not that those are not worth anything because this the natural story would tell you that when you look out there and you see an ear of corn start growing you know just you just see it just a little bit growing okay i got corn now let's go ahead and cut it down well brother dale no you'd kill it but i've heard people kill the gospel by saying luther wesley them didn't have anything there's only alpha and only omega see brother brown said it's all that's in between but you don't hear that when you're just saying nothing in between there's a quote of that see but the quotes will kill you remember all right but see now you see what the corn of wheat the grain of wheat the not corn it's the corn of wheat see it's not talking about raising corn even though corn is used it's talking about the corn of wheat in other words the the wheat itself growing all right so let's watch it now okay let's read the next quote 269 the anointed ones the end times 65 7 25 in the morning now i want you to know this is true you that listen to this tape you might have thought today that i was trying to say that about myself now he he's getting it playing then being that i was packing the message watching i have no more to do with it than nothing no more than just a voice in my voice even against my better judgment i wanted to be a trapper but it's the will of my father that i declare to do and determined to do i wasn't the one that appeared on the river jordan i was only standing there when he appeared i'm not the one that performed these things and foretells these things that happens as perfect as they are i'm only one that's near when he does it i was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what i knew it's what i just surrendered myself to myself to that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was a manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that god unfolded it's not a man it's god the angel was not the son of man he was a messenger from the son of man the son of man is christ he's the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man all right that should be enough to make everybody understand what we're talking about and put brother around him into his position and everything and to see that he's not the son of man but somebody's got to be the son of man in the end time well you're making yourself greater and brother branham no i'm just trying to come to the place to be what he just said he said i determined to do it because god wanted me to do it i'm kind of like gersom solomon i believe a rabbi richmond said one time i remember he said i can't have it god chose us but i didn't have anything to be chosen to come in this message but i'm glad he did you know i'm tickled to death about that part all right now he calls the son of man christ all right the one that you're feeding on which would be the work the reveal what is christ christ is just called the anointing by most people but christ to mean to me means the word and spirit together is one see the anointed word which is the revealed word the alive word all right now that's what i mean when i'm saying to christ you know coming all the way down not just to stop on anointed ones so look what he says on number two if you know it's page 15 it's right in the sun 65 418 the morning service now who is this son of man who is this son of man in the beginning was a word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us that's fine man can that be enough to know who the son of man is the word make flesh all right it goes down to the last parts of the different scriptures that are acquainted luke 17 30 malachi 4 that the word again is waved over the people that the dead traditions of man is dead and the son of god is alive again with the baptism of the holy spirit right among us and has given us life the son of god the baptism of the holy ghost is alive among us now let's just get the word and let it become disarmed simple language isn't it okay so what are we following look what he said on number three of your notes on the rapture 1965-1204 here at 117. that's all to be manifested in the grain of wheat at the end all right another come back if you take luke the 17th chapter and the 30th verse he said as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the coming son of man when the son of man begins to reveal himself what is reveal and this is what he said what is revealed make his revelation of what he is in this day make his revelation of what he is in this day revealed out to the people now this is not the days of luther this is not the days of western it's not the days of pentecost this is a very special day but makes his revelation make his revelation of what he is in this day revealed to the people the word that's made known for the day revealed to the people by the manifestation of the holy spirit making that jesus live among us all right making it live among us now watch the verb this point very carefully and you'll understand what i was talking about now watch the point we're going to get to and you'll understand what i was talking about how the bride must be the son of man now watch the illustration because that's what we're going to do we're going to follow the prophet through the message to see and we'll see that we are what the son of man what the grain of wheat that is promised to come for forth is the son of man the word there's john 12 23-24 because that was said it was fine to cover that as being the new birth coming through the ages but there's got to be a full grain of wheat come forth a mature grain you don't gather wheat or things as it's green or or whatever it is or corn or whatever you've got to let it go through the stages that it goes through and then it will be back to original grain see once that era corn or once that grain is formed and it's dried then it's capable of reproducing itself so you have you put one grain in the ground that comes up with a stalk you know and then the chutes and then the the the shucks and things and then you know the hush the shucks and all the come forth the husk on it and what it do then it walks out and then it's a grain of corn back again but you know what that grain corn has the ability to do reproduce itself to bring forth a head of wheat you know many many grains of wheat are a corn thing when they are corn and you look on there and each one of those kernels let it dry take each one of those kernels put it in the ground each one of those kernels will reproduce you don't just go out there and say well i'm going to plant me a garden in spring and you go out there and you plant one grain of corn here one here and one here and one here in the union and you know it comes up is one grain of corn comes up that wouldn't be too productive you know you'd be wasting time but see when it comes forth in a multiplied form is what you want all right so now what is it so the grain of wheat that is promised to come forth in the last days is the son of man and the grain of wheat is going to come forth end of bride that's why brother branham was not that grain of wheat by himself no more than john as we were covering this morning john could only type the rapture he was not the rapture and the only one going right he would only type in the ones that would go all right now he's got to come back to the same grain of wheat all right so let's look at number four anointing one's at the end time paragraph 165 just look you read all of it uh well let's go why does it why haven't there been an organization start up in these last 20 years of this great revival it's anointed prophets anointed teachers so forth but by but why ain't there there's nothing beyond the grain see it's back without an organization oh my a blind man could see that it can't cannot organize it's so firmly against us it's a grain of wheat itself the son of man will be made manifest the grain of wheat will come back to itself again the son of man in the last days well that's brother branham then that brother amen come on but he wasn't the son of man it's going to take the bride because it's not just one grain of wheat that jesus went into the ground and one grain of wheat's coming out in the end time he's got to come forth in a bride form all right the grain of wheat see all right now let me say something to you that you may not have considered so you cannot now quoting rhetoric you cannot denominate this message all right now you can organize it right now he said you could organize it into legacy in other words you can be just like the organizations all right but you can't denominate it now show me the denomination's been formed now i ain't saying the organization i ain't saying the clicks the the flings off the doctrinal ideas of the two soul the seven thunder virtues of perusias the river a doctrine i'm not saying that not talking about none whatsoever of that form i'm talking about the little bride around the world that is becoming the word of god as they hear the word all right now show me a show me a denomination that's formed out of it he brought around said 20 years there that was that was in his life see a minister always likes it about three years and then just in a few years and organized it and denominated now i agree that they're organizational what is an organization and i'm not against printing the books or anything like that thank god for all to do it but what is it doing let's get the the organization spirit said let's get together what luther had and we'll put it in books and then we can just we can have exactly what luther said well there's a lot of churches around the land today that are sitting there in the churches saying we don't want to listen to no preacher we want to get it straight from the prophet all right besides all the doctrines and things like that but that's none of my business that's nothing to me that's just saying it to show you that it's taking place to explain one thing what that the bride of jesus christ is having a revival because brother ryan said in this revival now he said the revival's over didn't he about 56 all right but here he says revival he said 20 years in this revival see the bride is having a revival ever since i come in this message i've been having a revival you know what a revival is that's not sinners getting saved a revival is to revive what's already saved we say we get a revival we get a bunch of lost people and all that you get a revival to get the the people in the church together and then sinners are going to hear about it they're going to come to see the fire see this message has been going quite a while 40 something years that i've been in it and i've been having a revival ever since brother dale i see you sometimes you're all right that ain't got nothing to do with it you've seen brother branham coming down through there but you know what he's having a revival but he said the revival to the world is over i ain't talking about a revival to the world i'm talking about a bride the bride's revival is what i talk about not the world no we're through with all of that see all right let's see what you're talking about all right now it will come back to itself again in other words this thing is going to have to come back until that little bride that will be taken up you know i use that now the little bride around the world i say it's a small group yes i'm talking about the bride now ain't talking about how he's following this message nothing like that i ain't cure ain't none what i'm talking about talking about the bribe bride's only the born again believers the rapture is only for the bride the royal seat of abraham i'm talking about that not everybody in the message that claims the message because that ain't none of my business now none of your business or none of us business who claims what probably said he didn't want me to be saved in the last moment to rapture the church so we're still believing in salvation and still believing in god working all right but in doing that now it's got to come back to the grain that went into the ground which was the lord jesus christ now get the point i know see the faith of the fathers was what was planted on the day of pentecost amen the faith of the founders is what was planted on the death pentecost not the full grain of the son of man because they didn't know what the seals were and things like that right that wasn't put into the ground it was put into the ground of the lord jesus yes for what he could bring forth but he only only could bring forth on the day of pentecost the faith of the fathers that's right all right now so in doing that see that is what's got to come forth first before you can talk about a grain of wheat you've got to be able to get back to what the pentecostals i'm talking about in the bible not a sister street right back to the book of acts and i contend for that i always get in trouble because i express it because i don't want to leave you dangling you bring them that was back there on the deaf pentecost up here today and they would probably tell you hey folks leave us alone and let us go back where we came from because we ain't never faced such a garbage can as this we only had two denominations pharisees and sadducees and herodians or whatever you want to call them i said my lord everything where we turn around there's one right i don't say that to try to prop up nothing i say it cause it's the truth you say i'm just doing that because make a justification well where are you at that's right that's the best way to say it and forgive me where are you at and where have you been you've been here with us all of this time and you know this church knows and those listening know that there's one thing brother dale's always done he's never been down and out about the word i've always been on fire about the word being revealed because that's my revival because i'm not looking for a revival to save the world that's right i'm looking to be revived myself to walk on the end of the word so i then you see what i'm talking about the faith of the fathers was that corn of wheat that went into the ground yes but when it comes back in the end time when that is standing here on the earth everybody in the world can have the faith of the fathers that's right and that still wouldn't be the corner wheat that fell in the ground because that would not be the full ministry of the lord jesus christ do you understand yes all right see it wouldn't be complete why because that wasn't him he then he's got to come forth the original grain of the lord jesus christ that went into the ground has got to come back these are a man has got to come back upon the earth again in that grain form all right i wrote it like this who was the original grain the lord jesus christ he was the original grain of wheat because he was the original word which was what the son of man the word might flesh all right look at number five you see how i get on this and i can stop and preach forever on just one thing brother i i remember when was in the baptists and things i know you're gonna thank dawn brother dale you never would that way but we used to we had sunday school class we'll see we would always uh take up the offering and he hauled around to try to kill a little time because we had an hour that we had to say something in how many of you ever come through there come on and so we'd goof off a little bit to kind of take up some time and then we finally get around to taking up the offer and we wanted the guy to be real slow taking up the offering because we you know we didn't have nothing to say yeah brother around come along he said i just don't have enough time to preach he said i could take any of these topics and preach for years on this one i'd hear him say that i said my lord i can probably take 30 minutes now to give out of what i've got you know but you know now i found out i can't give out i give out it just opens up the more keeps going but come on and watch what he says because i believe the bride of jesus christ now whether you believe it or anybody else here and believes that whatever i believe the bride of jesus christ will be the son of man the grain of wheat that went into the ground i believed it in 1969 when i preached it in about 7 69 74 a big brother came out started preaching about son of man and everybody went hallelujah well i did too because i was glad they finally caught on i don't claim seniority i just tell it like it is because that's where i started that because i believed it then how much more do you think i believe it now spiritual food and deer season 1965 7 18 in the evening paragraph 162. and he comes down to mystery of this those seals each one of those churches made an organization and and got into it and that's one of the secret things that's been wrong before god you see it dr lee see look it is that's the thing right there that's one of the secrets they organized in sea and was completely out of the will of god and that will be exposed in the last days and lead to people now be exposed that that's wrong and lead the people not to a creed or a denomination but back to the true word the true word will come to a certain group of people the son of man will reveal himself in the midst of them the same yesterday today and forever that's right now you say well that's just brother branham that wasn't what he said going down christ revealed his own word 65 8 22 the morning service then he was made actually human flesh and dwelt among us in the person of jesus christ himself born of the virgin mary he come in that form so he could die and went back into heaven now in this last days he has promised to manifest himself in the fullness again of his flesh in spirit and that's a good way of saying it but don't sound right does it again in his flesh in spirit see for it was in the days of sodom so for as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man now look at sodom how it's said and taken place jesus christ being manifested in bodily form of his church today okay see doing the same thing same work same things that he did all the time never changes the eternal one seen there's where that old thing comes in there i don't see nothing going on well get out of your backyard and look around the world just because it's not in your yard like i said we don't think about a trailer coming off of a trailer hitch and just hung on the chains and dragging it down the road and running off we don't think that's very much but you let it happen to you sometimes you'll change your mind maybe god needs to let some of those things happen to us where it'll change our minds what he has manifested himself in the human bodies our human bodies that he has called and done exactly the same thing he done in sundry time and in the times of his flesh upon the earth now let me stop right there brother branham had the sign of the son of man nobody else didn't have it but what did the rest of the people have just like their disciples had they had healings and signs and wonders now he wasn't it by himself was he the room never claimed to be the only guy on the pebble on the beach he said god is among us doing like he done in the book of acts and well yeah we see that brother branham now we you know that's we see that brother branham look what he goes on down to the next one mighty god unveiled 1964 uh 629 prior to page 21. he's talking about jesus as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man deity veiled again in human flesh oh yeah i can see it right around i see it brother adam i don't see it nobody else well what are you supposed to be you got the baptism of the holy ghost do you have the new birth hello i'm talking to the people that's got that idea you have the new birth come on within that new birth is deity amen it's what i told a man standing up at the tabernacle i mean i was at the schoolhouse where they were having a meeting there jeffersonville and he was talking about something and i said listen brother if you'll believe because i knew what he believed i said but if you believe i pointed over this brother i said if you'll believe that that brother right there with the new birth in his soul that that is deity speaking when he speaks then without the gifts and the signs and the wonders that went with the prophet now just that individual person being there i'll go with you on deity he said oh no brother i knew who his deity was and who his god was all right i didn't care to discuss anything else with it all right deity now remember didn't jesus say when the son of god is being revealed listen in luke the 17th and i believe in the 20th 21st or somewhere along there he said when the son of man is being revealed the son of man back in in the church again revealed in human beings amen human beings not son of god but the son of man again back in the church again in the last days we find that he promised that and got there in god's promises yeah we're back with a quote we was given this morning kind of on and talking on it what was it unveiling of god 1964 614 the morning service paragraph 68 and then after the holy spirit and he came versus the prophet and they crucified him his own crucified him he came as the son of man then after the holy spirit came he was then in the son of god not as a spirit he was the holy spirit son of god he lived through the church ages as son of god now in the millennium he'll be son of david sitting upon the throne of his father david he is the son of david now he's already to son of david there's nobody that knows it that's right you don't gain no attributes he's already got him he's waiting on somebody to display it right and remember between the son of god now he's explaining what i did this morning that it goes son of man son of god son of man son of david that's why he's got to return in the end time is that and now between the son of god in the lady of sin church age they put him out and in luke he said that he would be revealed against son of man the prophet fulfilling the rest of it and the scriptures tie perfectly together son of man son of god son of david what was it it's the same god all the time just changing his form in morphe he just changed it it's a great drama to him he's acting it out he's acting it out in other words coming back to be in what the original grain that went into the ground the original word that went into the ground all right so now watch what it comes to number nine and you know see not out with a shock 65 to 18 paragraph 97 he talked about one's a bride the other one's a church he said there's no comparison at all i like that from one woman and free woman is what he's explaining he's explaining the denominations persecute the genuine grain all right coming down to it but still they are not the seed that's promised to come listen neither was sarah neither was hagar neither sarah or or neither mary was deceived what's in there mary was not deceived can you quote that and people take that quote and they said see that marry mary wouldn't deceive she represents seducing street pentecost and so that means they have nothing my brother didn't say that right azusa street pentecost was the word the seed but not the seed back like it was supposed to be not the grain of wheat like it was supposed to be write that down listen mary was not the seed she was the carrier of the seed the city's talking about the grain of wheat right right but she had nurtured look what she done brought forth out of her wound just like the shuck brought forth from its wound to real seed but the shuck is not the seed now back in sarah what was it to be uh abraham and sarah which would be the the child coming from there would be the great one all right you followed me but the shuck is not the seed this looks like the shuck brought forth its wound from this wound the real seed see it brought forth there zeus street pentecost brought the birth of the word but that wasn't the final seed read masterpiece when you get a change or just listen to it and notice the times brought around what he's talking about that mary is not the seed and look what he's talking about she's not the original grain mary gave birth to a baby that was the original brain right but we're not to give birth to a baby we're to give birth to a full grown word right all right so follow it but the shuck is not the seed it's only it's closer to the seed it hugged up around the sea thank god for that shot to take care of us i can always say you know it's natural well thank god for the national rifle association i don't even belong to it but thank god for them because they trying to keep our freedom for a while right that's just in a natural i mean i don't belong to it they kept on sending me guns and i didn't know them and i told them i said i'm paid up for a long time and you're sending me done here to get me to pay you your records show that i'm paid up take my name off that was the reason way back up in the stalk the life is scattered all through the stalk now you with me the life is scattered when the two little shoots comes up that's green that's life when the stalk comes up that's green that's life when the tassel comes on the corn and when you've got all of the things the shuck and all it's green it's got life in it don't cut it down because you can't do it but after a while inside of that shuck the problem you heard him looking there with a microscope and you see a little bitty bud he said there's original seed because that's what you're annoying to be life is scattered all through the shook stalks and when it comes to the pollen it's gathered down closer and when it comes to the shuck it's right down there like the seed and forms it almost like the seed jesus told us what would be in the last days be so close we would see the very elective possible but when the seed comes forth from there and the shook the life leaves the shook and the shuck is a carrier and that's exactly what our denomination has been a carrier luther wesley pentecost and now it's time for the seed to come forth now it's time see he's not out with a shuck that was 97 this is uh paragraph 143. pentecost was as merry pentecostal feast look what mary did what did mary do wrong at a pentecostal feast one time she was faced with a bunch of dignities dignitaries excuse me priest when her son she couldn't find him anywhere and she went back three days journey she left him like a modern church today about three times five or 25 has a church left about 50 years ago we're 75 left him at the pentecostal feast ain't that pentecosting that to people with this message we've got the word we've got the word we've got the word we are the seed and then living like the devil well that don't match up if i don't live what i preach would you please come and tell me you said well brother let's see that that's human now let's don't get onto this those parts because you got them let's talk about where that i'm out drinking gambling i'm doing all kind of things garbage cans i mean let's don't just get on a little pity patty thing or we can pity pat ourselves to death well you look at me and say well i've seen you do this and look basically i've seen you do that what good is that but we don't get out in the world of sin but look what happened left him at the pentecostal feast murray went back up with joseph three days looking for it she's been looking for him could she'd been looking for him couldn't find it she found him what did she find she found him in the temple discussing the word of god to the priest and right in the front of those priests those dignified mary let the curtain drop she did every exactly the things she should not have done call her god the mother of god you know who that's how many a mother or have more wisdom than her son and she said your father and i have sought you with tears for days and nights your father and i claiming that the birth wasn't supernatural that joseph was the father of jesus she denied the supernatural birth pentecost took speaking in tongues they denied the birth of the word that's exactly what it did they'll take so much of it but they won't take the rest of it it died the birth of the word just like mary so that's why he's saying that mary is not the same she gave birth but jesus was the seed what mary gave birth to an azusa street gave birth to the end time message of the baptism of the holy ghost and brother branham says that's when the prophet came oh no no no i didn't come to well you don't know your message go to 464 the seal book i'm pretty sure that's right there's no messenger to the age because the holy ghost came himself in the fullness then after them the prophet comes and the holy ghost had to come onto zeus street to make ready for brother brandon to come all right but now watch just keep on going where are we down to 11. all right see not out with a shuck 65 429 b the paragraph 77 now mary was not the seed she was only to shut through the seed the two others was carriers of life only the natural seed mary was not deceit herself but like faith in god's word brought a more real image of the word because he was the word but like the shock of a wheat the corn of wheat the shuck holds the wheat inside of it and protects it until it's able to able or mature to go on on its own see then it was the seed itself that left her just like the seed was in her womb she wasn't the seed she didn't produce the seed god is the seed now you see what she's saying that's not saying a zeus street was false they gave birth to the word easy age gave birth to the word martin luther gave birth to the word let's see that's where people won't follow it all the way through right they cut the scorn down if you looked in wesley it wasn't worth anything cut it down oh but you can't do that brother dale well i'm glad you thought of that if you thought of that a long time ago you wouldn't have the doctrines you've got right you don't understand brother you don't understand brother dale why i say a lot of those things maybe it's somebody out there because see a long time ago these doctrines would float in the land that's a doctrine it was back in 1968 and great people of great men in this message says that azusa street was false and lutheran western then was false i wish to demand to his face it didn't do any good he come right here to this church that night and said the same thing again didn't change him one whatsoever you know why because he couldn't be corrected that's why it didn't change him but listen look at the unveiling of god 64 614 paragraph 318 now to the perfect after the shuck has been formed after the tassels been formed after the grain has come unto the cob then it has to come to perfection back to a regular grain again and remember the grain must be germatized see if it don't it won't live see none of that was outside of them messages will ever come to life it has to be germanized too remember the same life that was in the stalk is in the grain see it's just maturing itself back see he revealed himself what son of man the grain that went into the ground get the message the greek said to him we would see jesus he said except the corner wheat falls into the ground he turned him right to his death burial and resurrection was the only way they'd ever be ever seen harvest time 64 12 12 paragraph 353 now doesn't malachi 4 teach us that before the great and terrible day of the lord shall come that this will take place how many knows that and he will restore the heart of the children to the fathers is that right the faith of the original pentecostal fathers and in that day luke 17 20 i believe it is jesus said when the son of man is being revealed not man the son of man not an organization the son of man the living the word living itself among the people how much stronger could you state those things i said these in 69 it didn't do any good will it today the word itself may flesh in you you are a reflection this hour the message reflection of it see you live again live the life that was in jesus christ you're in the presence of the son then to what happens to it what happens to that church finally listen that shock pulls away from that wheat when it begins to be manifested what happened the life that was in the shook went on out in the wheat the life won't change the carriers change they denominate see the blade the tassel of the show but the wheat can't change it's got to be a ministry that's exactly on the word like he was on the word like the first church was on the word spirit-filled word fed not denominational word fed let me get my notes i'm wondering where in the world i'm at now let me make a statement or two back up through here see someone must make manifest the word or seed for this day that's right now someone must do that someone must make manifest so that's our job the prophet done his job he brought the message thank god what greater honor could be than to stand there one day and us introduce him introduce us to jesus christ what greater thoughts could they be to give a man that much honor so close to god until he said one day he said if you call me jesus you're closer if you call me an antichrist now that's what he said and that's how close it was god used a man to bring you and i a message but yet do we believe it right do we believe it look at number 14 you know spoken word original seed now for the birth of the word is christ not a not a denom not a polluted with denominations the early church no denominations right holy church okay just the word and spirit irrigated right brother the god laid the word down like that and the holy spirit irrigated and there she went she went forth she brought forth children certainly but this church can't do it they talk about the organization they can't do it she's too denominated see she can't do it she's got the world mixed up with her look what they did and what did they do look at the last one that's not the last of the quotes but look at the the next one bert payne's 1965 124 page 1 page 27 notice quickly now she is in that stage beyond the shadow of doubt we're in the ladies in church age now her messenger is promised in malachi the fourth chapter he's promised to do it and the message is to bring back the word bring the people back to the word birth to be she's to be delivered of a new birth from according to malachi 4. to be delivered of a new bird from according to malachi 4. now do you understand what i'm saying before we get on the rest of it see jesus christ the son of man was the original grain of wheat he came and talked to their disciples and told them and when the people came to say sirs we would see jesus brother and said they wanted to see god they wouldn't just come in to see jesus you know we want to see jesus they had heard that he was god and they wanted to see god all right he turned to him and he said unless the corn of wheat falls into the ground said it'll bite alone we said now if it does in other words you're going to kill me you're going to take my life you're going to be part of this program but it's going to be on the wrong side you're going to take my life and in doing that you're going to do the greatest honor could ever be because you're going to allow me to go into the ground and then i can come forth i might not be able to come forth as we say about it there were where peter said to to jesus said to peter who do men say i the son of man am he said dark to christ the son of the living god in other words a statement from me i say okay he didn't understand what jesus was talking about but jesus said upon this rock of who he was the christ the son of the living god i'll be on my church and the gates of hell will be against it but cannot prevail but one day i'll come back to it myself you see brother branham was not that one to come back i preached that to you where he was waiting there in the seals and then that great one came to open the seals because even the angel that brother random had there with him couldn't open the seals it didn't he was the one that called it the healing angel he's the one who called it a minor angel he was waiting on somebody that somebody was the lord jesus christ that came to brother branham to tell him those seals because it was nobody else knew about it because he was the son of man all right but now we've got to turn back to get back to where the faith of the fathers is before we can talk about son of man we must come forth as the son of god the faith of the fathers right uh the reasonable faith then we can talk about the son of man all right see but then the prophet people say well why is this oh well see the prophet had to bring the message and then go off the scene right because then he says it will be these seven thunders which were the seven what is it messenger of malachi 4 do two things 424 is that what it is church age book this message of malachi 4 would do two things one turn the hearts of the children back to faith the fathers to reveal the seven thunders which is revelation contained in the seven sealed it'll be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children back huh and see then he had to bring the message but then we've got the message to study until we become the message now learning the intellectually is not what we're talking about although that's a wonderful thing right don't you wish that you could remember everything the bible said right don't you wish you could remember everything the prophet said well you know you know the reason a lot of people don't remember they don't read it that may be dirty but but listen folks many many years ago 25 30 i tried to preach this about mary not being deceived that there was something to come and people back there oh yeah looking for something to come probably somebody you're trying to make himself something no i was telling what the prophet said well you know now the people are gradually catching on to that and i'm glad of it me i'm tickled to death that the people around the world are catching on to the message and finally getting into reading the message wouldn't like we was when we started i'd say something to the people and they'd say where broke around say that number one i said something they said well where'd he say it i said he said message so-and-so he said i just got through this in that tape and i didn't hear it i just went to the car and got the book turned to the page and said here and read it i don't know whether he slept through what is there or like some of you you know and missed it and then blame me for other things and say i said so and so but listen church this is no play purdy you've got to have the seed planted in the field before you can get the grain of corn and to do that there's a lot of stirring up in the ground there's a lot of plowing the the things you know it takes a while to prepare the soil well at least we ought to be into the time now that we can see the shock coming up and pulling loose right brother said when when the bride begins to say i and my father are one and those other things he said the shook will pull away all right but that don't mean it's fully mature does it right the seed's got to lay in the presence of the sun to ripen now here's the point do you understand that the bride must be or at least understand what i say that the bride must be the grain of corn that went into the ground reproduced again exactly like it was and this grain will be so mature like him until now it's not going to happen but you could take it and put it in the ground and it bring forth it's not going to happen because it's not going to take place this time this time it's going up in a rapture when it's fully matured it'll take a rapture the grain of wheat mary was not that she only carried the baby the baby was the grain of wheat we are not to give birth to a baby we're to give birth to a full grown man the son of man the word of god now you think the bride don't have nothing to do with it you know i said all of that he said brother dale you read revelations 5 1 2 7 you ain't said a word about it you just you just read that well i wrote it down like this i'm glad you thought that let's read let's read something your prophecy we've talked about the grain of wheat we've talked about the other things where does that lamb come from that takes the book on the lamb lord jesus christ amen but where does he come from i'm trying to preach over again what i just preached that the grain of wheat must come back again in multiple forms all right so now watch it where does that lamb come from the breach 1963 317 evening paragraph 16. all right john hadn't noticed the lamb before you know here i was reading revelations 1. he talks about this the different things in revelation 5 excuse me and he talks about different things you want to read it he talks about the book written within he talked about one sitting on the throne he talks about all kind of things but he hasn't seen the lamb until you get over the verse uh really to him to see the lamb was verse six the messenger picks up in in the other verses but watching what he's saying john hadn't noticed this lamb before you know here he he hadn't been mentioned before nowhere had it been mentioned john didn't see it all over the heavens as he's looking but here it come forward notice where it came forth where did it come from where did the lamb come from it came from the father strong where he had been seated since he had been slain and raised up now remember to start of the message you remember this morning what's the father's throne son of god baptism of the holy ghost son of god father strong the lamb comes from the father's from work from the church ages he'd been slain and raised up raised up sit on the right hand of god ever living to make intercessions amen raised there today as an intercessor with his own blood to make intercession upon the ignorance of the people now oh that's the one i'm dependent on he was covered with bleach and the bleach of the forgiveness of sin keep on reading 16 a mighty god unveiled 64 629 page 9. we find that after his death burial and resurrection he came on the day of pentecost the son of god god the spirit and the form holy spirit what was he doing he was changing himself making himself known to his people in a different form like the holy spirit which is god he came to deal through the seven church ages as son of god the holy spirit but in the millennium he comes as son of david to sit on the throne of david he was to take the throne of david he's on the father's strong now and then he said he that overcometh shall sit with me on my throne as i've overcome and sit with my father on here so in the millennium he be son of david what is it the same god all the time just changing his mask where did he come from what did that lamb look like according to what we read in the bible it had seven horns and seven eyes funny looking lamb funny looking lamb a lamb you ever seen a lamb with seven horns and seven eyes now i've seen them with a couple of eyes and a couple of horns but never seen that funny-looking lamb and remember now i don't remember where i've got it here or not but just remember send the seal book brother and said just don't he wouldn't know lambs because he took the book he's not a lay on there it's the only one that could open the book who is the only one that can open the book the son of man all right so now let's read revelation chapter 5 part 2 1961 618 paragraph 204 seven seals seven spirits seven angels seven horns and seven churches see seven seven sevens there's five sevens which seven is perfection five is grace god's grace to his seven church ages his seven messenger men men his spirit his seven spirits from god now we know they're not seven spirits of god what is it it's down through seven church ages right and the seven planned seals of redemption we're in right now the seven horns means seven ages because a horn means a kingdom you remember the crown that come upon the beast horn in daniel and so forth it means a kingdom are are seven ages and remember jesus said some fell asleep in the first watch one watch another watching the next watch the next what's next next and poem down to the seventh watch and in the seventh watch the bridegroom come then all of them awaken remember that so it's seven ages as this that was the seven horns and the seven churches are seven dispensations or the body of believers is just as perfect as it can be jeremiah my the book ages how it was redeemed no okay go to the bricks seven horns with the seven churches see the seven church ages because that was the lamb's protection what he protected his rights with on earth as a god sent group of people that's protected see the horn of the lamb seven eyes are the seven messengers of seven church ages seven eyes seven seers going down breach 1963 317 e page 102 that was 101. i read just above there and now he's coming down and he's talking about zerubbabel with those seven those are the eyes of the lord who run two and four through the whole earth the seven eyes e eyes mean seeing sin means prophets seers this lamb had seven horns and on each horn had an eye seven eyes what is it christ and his bride seven church ages out of there with seven prophets that went forth seven seers eyes so the last one must be a seer all right now where did the lamb come from the lamb come from the church ages well brother i tell you what now i just don't see how that could be well you're gonna argue with the prophet that's your business i call us a bunch of ignoramuses it don't take the devil to destroy this message all it takes is a bunch of preachers devil don't even have to do nothing he just says back in life cause he don't even have to move his hand i said one time listen to a guy for a long time that his claim and he was there with brother branham and brother brown called his name and everything hunted with him and saw all kind of things and he spent quite a time trying to prove that a mule could have a an offspring he had a book that showed it you know this mule had an offspring but you know what i was sitting there thinking i thought is he trying to build a message up or tear it down now which one is it i mean that's all i could think right why why didn't he say well now listen this your mu wasn't just a mule it was it looked like a mule but it had all the parts of a female in the right order and there was more mules you know most people don't know that jenny's my muse they call them but you see was he trying to turn the message down or was he trying to build it up well i showed the prophet was wrong project said a mule couldn't have one i showed right there i did was that what he was he trying to do he never went on and said those things it was showing that that wasn't a mule that that was a freak of nature that happened see the preachers of this message are the ones that destroys the bible it's not the laity amen i never had trouble with laity i have trouble with preachers well i'll tell you what i just can't see how that lamb was coming from the church ages but where'd it come from because see you're looking like that you're trying to find a lamb that walking out from somewhere and it's got to do this and you're not looking at the bible the bible was written 2 000 years ago you know give or take all right and it talked about a lamb that would come forth your prophet is explaining what those things are not telling you how did a lamb come from the church ages up through the eight and out and then at lamb walked out and went up took the book he's explaining what happens in the ages and what takes place whatever you think about azusa street or whatever you think about luther wesley them they gave birth to the word of their age and that was all they was responsible for as i said a moment ago read it 464 seal book you'll find brother brown talks about a prophet coming on azusa street it wasn't the one-eyed black man but he was the messenger to the age the prophet was the lord jesus christ who came back then the name began to be restored and then the things begin to open and your prophet is explaining now where this lamb comes from it's when the bride gives birth to that grain yeah but we're here and they just got me all confused no i got you where you was and no you're confused you were already confused or don't know exactly what i'm saying is the truth it's not just a lamb coming forth it's not a seven horns and seven eyes it's where that's coming from we must give birth to the word amen amen well brother brown's already took the book now where did he take the book see now what you're doing no he's already explained the book that's the way i see it he didn't have to take the book and do anything right he said well it did over here yeah and then one that i know that was took was sure what's bitter in the belly if you want to make out of him that's all i know about it but you see that corn of wheat that went into the ground would come back again in the end time it doesn't matter whether it's on the earth or not and then undo it it was god's way of bringing it right and he would bring her down through the ages and we give birth to the word azusa street pentecost gave birth to this end time word as a child your prophet picked it up and began right there and went right on to bring the word but he couldn't do nothing but a restoration of the faith of the fathers up until 63 and then the seals would come and break he said oh if that lamb could precede all the way from glory and come tonight revelations 5 he said is the most sublime or something most sublime scripture in the whole bible i don't know i might continue in revelation 5 just a minute but you know another message but because it shows us like i've told you if you want to see yourself read the book of revelations the book we were told not to read but the symbolics there had to be seven church ages and those church ages would produce the lamb and that lamb then could take the book but it's not taking a book see that's what we're looking at we're looking at some kind of a thing that's got somebody come up and take a book or glam take a book or just take a book or that look at the revelation of god's word amen look what he's revealing not what something i don't understand that symbol because it's 7179 that's church you mean them denominations had something to do with the none of them denominations in the bride you want me to quote brother random one that really knocked me for a loop many many years until the lord spoke to me about it i knew the order of events and how everything laid and how the bad this was way back what 200 years ago almost or something and coming down from john smith and all of that and alexander campbell it keeps coming on down it's got to come through the methodist because the baptist was between the the um lutherans and the the uh is way on back i've listened to a tape one day and i really had to run it back and listen look around said the baptist is just to become a denomination i'll be glad to find that for you he said they just become a denomination but we thought when wesley come forth they denominated and died and the biggest portion did but you see what caused denominations to be denominations is when they rejected this message when they turned down this message whether it be in the 40s or the 50s or whether it be when they turned this message down that's where they denominated and died right there right see he was allowed to go among them for a long time and preach among the people but then one day they put him out didn't you see what i'm talking about we're looking at a lamb taking a book we're looking at something like a throne brother bradley said you know what he said about it he said he climbed up on the throne and sat down right that's in the seal book he took the book out of the hand of the one sitting on the throne climbed up on the throne and sat down well that makes two people sitting on the throne that's not right what did he do the church ages gave birth to the word and the word goes right up and climbed up and set down on the throne and the father is strong because that's not his strong revelation 5 is not as strong you got to get over chapter 19 to find his throne that he climbed up on the throne and said i am i believe that soul's in prison he climbed up on the throne and said i am in other words he became the one on the throne we were the ones that dethroned him he was never off the throne we dethroned him by our doctrines when we made it to trinitarianisms and things and we dethroned him you ever heard the message raising jesus from history you were to get that sermon and listen to it raising jesus from history what's he saying see back down through there we took him off the throne and made him a trinity that's what they've done at nicaea 325 a.d they took him off the throne as almighty god and made him a denomination i mean made him a trinity it's our revelation brother gary's got to be restored not just some kind of a throne somewhere that's right not a lamb going forth and taking a book it's a revelation of what god has done among us to show who we are show what he thinks of his bride she's him made manifest brother callie preached many many years ago he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are the people in the sheep of his pastor he thinks i can't remember that good that's probably been 30 years ago it is he that has made us back on these things when you bring that that grain of wheat right back you're standing there in revelations 5 with a lamb with a book in his hand seeing jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever listen come on brother sorry to take a little bit longer this afternoon but just wanted to get the point across i hope you followed my line proving that he was a that the the grain of wheat is the bride and then proving the bride is the man with seven horns and seven eyes that's where he comes from he comes from the bride to do those things well i thought that was off up in heaven up there somewhere but yeah one of these days we'll find out that what i've told you years ago i quit trying to go to heaven that's been about 30 years ago and the lord spoke to me about it i said well i don't want to go to heaven i imagine that really put it in a lot of people's cranium couch to hear me say it but i've meant it and i still mean it because i believe god's got to come here before we can go there let's see we don't want to believe what the prophet had to say what do we got i tried 61 in the red book 61 anybody have an 8 cause i believe that same god is still here i believe he heals if he can deliver a message and keep it straight he can heal the body and righteousness i dare not trust that lamb is here she gave my birth to a baby mary done that we must give birth to a man allowed to take them in other what the prophet i'm concerned with what god gave that prophet the word that he could give it to me what do you think is is on that lamb it's got to be that grain of wheat that son of man is that lamb birth from the ages the bride has had something to do is lord did you make this manifesto why can't we believe it lord jesus we send this prayer claw for this one's being operated on we believe you that by your stripes everything will be all right because we thank you and jesus is your name amen you still defend that owner keep it longer foreign is is me a woman harass me hold on is come here
