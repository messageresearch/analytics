[4:10] to be the same. We love you and we thank
[4:12] you. Guide us now and keep us in Jesus'
[4:15] name. Amen.
[4:18] Revelation, it'll be kind of an odd way
[4:20] of tying together two things, but I'm
[4:23] pray forth.
[4:26] Revelations 10.
[4:28] And I saw another mighty angel come down
[4:31] from heaven, clothed with a cloud, and a
[4:33] rainbow was upon his head, and his face
[4:36] was as it were the sun, and his feet as
[4:39] pillars of fire. And he had in his hand
[4:42] a little book open. And he set his right
[4:45] foot upon the sea, and his left foot
[4:48] upon the earth,
[4:50] or on the earth, and cried with a loud
[4:53] voice as when a lion roarth. And when he
[4:56] had cried, "Seven thunders uttered their
[4:58] voices." And when the seven thunders had
[5:00] uttered their voices, I was about to
[5:03] write. And I heard a voice from heaven
[5:06] saying unto me, "Seal up those things
[5:08] which the seven thunders uttered, and
[5:11] write them not." And the angel which I
[5:14] saw stand upon the sea and upon the
[5:17] earth, lifted up his hand to heaven, and
[5:19] swear by him that liveth forever and
[5:21] ever, who created heaven and the things
[5:24] that therein are, and the earth, and the
[5:26] things that therein are, and the sea,
[5:29] and the things which are therein,
[5:32] that there should be time no longer, but
[5:34] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[5:36] angel, when he shall begin to sound, the
[5:39] mystery of God should be finished, as
[5:42] heath declared to his servants the
[5:45] prophets. Notice it says singular
[5:48] the mystery.
[5:49] Amen.
[5:50] All right.
[5:51] So, there's got to be something. This is
[5:53] the ending up of all things. This is the
[5:56] consummation. The book of Revelation is
[5:58] the ending up of all things. And we know
[6:01] that that there's a great mystery to be
[6:03] brought forth in the last days. And
[6:07] we've probed at it, looked at it in
[6:09] different ways. We come down through the
[6:11] Baptist. We were talking about it last
[6:12] night that we talked about the Gentiles
[6:15] being grafted in. We we had those
[6:17] things. We studied those things as we
[6:20] were coming up through. But there's a
[6:22] still a mystery left
[6:25] that would incor incorporate is I don't
[6:28] know how the best way to say it, but
[6:30] would involve the whole one mystery.
[6:33] That's right.
[6:33] To bring it forth. And that's why it
[6:35] says in the in the the mystery, the
[6:37] singular, there's got to be one mystery.
[6:40] All right. Just finishing all of it up.
[6:42] Okay. Now we go to Ephesians
[6:46] 3.
[6:50] For this cause I Paul the prisoner of
[6:52] Jesus Christ for you Gentiles. Now who's
[6:55] he talking to?
[6:57] You have heard of the dispensation of
[6:59] the grace of God which is given me to
[7:01] youward. In other words, who was it?
[7:03] This is Paul. You remember Paul said,
[7:06] you know, if you count it unworthily,
[7:07] lo, I turn to the Gentiles. And he he
[7:09] went forth with the gospel. How that by
[7:12] revelation he made known unto me the
[7:14] mystery
[7:16] as I wrote a for in few words. See the
[7:20] mystery.
[7:21] Amen.
[7:22] Whereby when you read you may understand
[7:27] my knowledge in the mystery of Christ
[7:30] which in other ages was not made known
[7:32] unto the sons of man. See, they didn't
[7:34] understand throughout the Old Testament,
[7:38] they was speaking of the Gentiles coming
[7:40] in, but they didn't understand how that
[7:43] it would be brought in.
[7:45] All right? And they they would the Jews
[7:47] Oh, they were they don't like that. But
[7:50] that's Paul is covering this to them.
[7:53] Which in other ages was not not made
[7:57] known unto the sons of men. And it is as
[8:00] it is now revealed unto his holy
[8:03] apostles and prophets by the spirit.
[8:06] Who's going to bring it forth? Now what
[8:08] is this mystery? That the Gentiles
[8:10] should be fellow heirs and of the same
[8:13] body and partakers of his promise in
[8:17] Christ by the gospel. You may be seated.
[8:20] The Lord add his blessing to the reading
[8:22] of the word. Now I want you to
[8:26] bear with me for a second as to uh you
[8:31] know try to get things in line. See Paul
[8:36] spoke of here and spoke in Romans and
[8:40] bringing out the coming in of the
[8:41] Gentiles. That was a mystery. It was a
[8:45] mystery in the Old Testament that the
[8:47] Gentiles would become into, you know,
[8:50] Gentiles as nations, people, us that
[8:52] were not Jews, you know, and all like
[8:55] that. And see, there was a mystery that
[8:58] we would come into and receive the
[9:01] kingdom the same as the Jews had the
[9:04] kingdom. Now, it was made in and all in
[9:07] the Bible was set forth to be brought to
[9:10] the Jews. They were even the adoption
[9:13] the scripture says pertained to Israel.
[9:15] All of the things the engraftings the
[9:18] different things that happened it all
[9:20] took place for Israel and they were the
[9:24] people of God the children of God. All
[9:28] right. But see, all the way down through
[9:29] there, you had different things that
[9:31] spoke of it in in, you know, one way or
[9:34] the other, types or shadows, speaking of
[9:37] a time coming that the Gentiles would
[9:40] come into the kingdom. All right? So,
[9:43] they refused him. You know, the Jews
[9:46] turned him down. And lo, he turned to
[9:49] the Gentiles through the Apostle Paul.
[9:51] And Paul's whole ministry turned to the
[9:54] to the Gentiles. And he, you know, he
[9:57] brought the gospel to them of the
[9:59] mystery that he said is even spoken of
[10:02] back in the gospels. Things that
[10:05] happened, uh, you know, the Gentiles
[10:07] coming in, you you find those things.
[10:10] David had 300 mighty men that control
[10:13] the hair's breath and they were all
[10:14] Gentiles.
[10:16] They were back there at the times. the
[10:18] the great warriors of faith, a lot of
[10:21] them in the Old Testament were actually
[10:23] Gentiles, you know, because they they
[10:26] they were the great warriors of faith.
[10:30] Okay?
[10:31] But it's not speaking, see, it was just
[10:33] speaking of something, a type or a
[10:35] shadow. As we were discussing last
[10:36] night, when you talk about types and
[10:39] shadows, remember that uh you're you're
[10:42] not talking of a thing into reality.
[10:45] you're speaking of something to come
[10:48] that is hidden and it's all you're doing
[10:51] is uh exposing it or bringing it out in
[10:55] the open as to uh a type of it.
[11:00] In other words, something would happen
[11:01] back David and his great warriors and
[11:03] the great thing would speak of the
[11:05] kingdom that would come in Jesus Christ.
[11:08] All right? See those things back in the
[11:10] gospel. All right? And in doing that,
[11:12] then it was spo speaking back there that
[11:15] the Gentiles would come in and they did,
[11:18] right?
[11:19] They come in and accepted Jesus Christ
[11:21] and he turned there, Paul did, to the
[11:23] Gentiles and bringing it. And you you
[11:25] get in the Gospels in the book of Acts
[11:27] and and it turns to where that the
[11:29] gospel goes to the Gentiles as well as
[11:32] to the Jews because it was made to be
[11:34] for everyone.
[11:36] Right?
[11:36] Amen.
[11:36] See, that's why it's called a gentile
[11:38] dispensation. Right?
[11:40] Gentile means nations. It just it
[11:42] doesn't have to have a name. Uh in a
[11:45] gentile dispensation, you can have uh
[11:47] Jews, Chinese, uh Koreans,
[11:51] anything, you know, Africans or any
[11:54] anything. You can have all of the people
[11:58] into that because it's a kingdom of the
[12:01] Gentiles,
[12:02] nations. All right? It's not no one
[12:05] certain people. It's not set aside to
[12:07] well it's this group of people it's that
[12:09] group of people. It's open to where that
[12:12] you can receive Jesus Christ as your
[12:14] savior if you accept it that way and
[12:17] bring it in. And that's what we want to
[12:19] talk about for a minute that there's a
[12:22] great mystery there
[12:25] more than see if Paul was speaking of a
[12:28] mystery but yet explaining it as to the
[12:31] coming in of the Gentiles. Why would he
[12:33] not be satisfied
[12:35] with that? And why would he speak of a
[12:37] mystery?
[12:39] See, he would speak of a mystery and
[12:42] speak of it as the Gentiles coming in.
[12:46] You follow me? He would speak of the
[12:48] Gentiles coming into the kingdom to be
[12:50] the children of God.
[12:52] Right?
[12:52] All right. And as he would speak of
[12:54] that, see, then he would put that to the
[12:57] basis to where that the the uh coming in
[13:01] of the gentile dispensation would would
[13:04] open up to where everybody could come
[13:07] in.
[13:08] And he would know that and see that was
[13:10] known back there.
[13:12] But where's the mystery?
[13:14] Because still Paul left the mystery,
[13:16] right?
[13:18] You said, "Well, where did he leave?" He
[13:20] left the mystery. Did it come all the
[13:21] way to Revelations
[13:24] 10?
[13:26] That's right.
[13:27] And it comes and brings it about a
[13:30] mystery.
[13:32] There's a mystery there that was sealed
[13:35] in the word of God
[13:37] that was waiting till this day.
[13:41] Amen.
[13:42] And we say, well, it was the engrafting
[13:44] of the Gentiles. You know, the coming
[13:46] in. All right. That's wonderful. That's
[13:49] part of the mystery. That that's truth.
[13:51] That's showing forth what it is. And
[13:54] it's types and shadows all the way
[13:55] through. And we can spend weeks and and
[13:58] months up on the coming in of the
[14:00] Gentile dispensation and all the types
[14:03] and shadows of it.
[14:04] But the main point I want you to see is
[14:07] that after all is said and done,
[14:10] after all that's been made known down
[14:13] through the Bible times, that there's
[14:16] still a mystery according to the book of
[14:18] Revelation. That's right.
[14:21] There's still a mystery.
[14:22] That's right.
[14:23] A mystery is something that is hidden
[14:26] and it has to be revealed.
[14:28] Amen.
[14:29] All right.
[14:30] Amen.
[14:30] Now, we can look back, as I said, we can
[14:32] say, well, the the coming in of the
[14:34] Gentiles.
[14:36] Well, that was the mystery. Yeah, that
[14:38] was what Paul spoke of.
[14:40] That was a mystery.
[14:41] Amen. and he was uh happy to be able to
[14:44] express those things and bring it out,
[14:47] you know, and deliver it to the people
[14:48] that that it was his gospel.
[14:51] That's right.
[14:53] That he was chosen for that.
[14:55] Amen.
[14:55] See, and and it's wonderful to to know
[14:58] the position Paul was put in because
[15:00] see, he was put into the position of
[15:03] understanding that mystery.
[15:05] Amen.
[15:05] And be able to express the mystery.
[15:08] All right. He could go back. the others
[15:10] couldn't do it. But once Paul got
[15:13] converted and turned to God with his
[15:16] whole heart, you think about all of that
[15:19] learning
[15:21] that he had within him.
[15:22] That's right.
[15:23] That that was what he was trained to be.
[15:26] Either a a high priest or a lawyer or
[15:29] something. He was a high ranking uh man
[15:32] trained in all of the things,
[15:35] you know. All right.
[15:36] But one day he said, "I just count all
[15:38] that dong.
[15:40] to win Christ.
[15:41] All right.
[15:42] See, he just counted it all canceled
[15:45] out. But yet still, he didn't quit.
[15:48] No,
[15:48] that's right.
[15:49] See, he didn't quit the thing because
[15:51] that was the kingdom.
[15:53] Amen.
[15:53] And he was trying to explain. Now
[15:56] listen, Paul was trying to explain
[16:00] to the not the natural Jew,
[16:04] right?
[16:06] Of the coming in of the Gentiles,
[16:08] right? Amen.
[16:10] I'm trying to make a mystery where
[16:11] you'll think about it of what it is and
[16:14] then we'll come to our day and our time.
[16:16] Okay.
[16:17] You know,
[16:18] see Paul,
[16:21] he could explain the Gentiles coming in
[16:23] after he explained it to them.
[16:26] Then they could go back and look and
[16:27] say, "Yeah, I see that. Yeah, I see
[16:29] this. Yeah, that's what happened here.
[16:31] Yeah, David had all these mighty men and
[16:33] this that and the other." And see,
[16:36] Abraham himself
[16:38] was a gentile.
[16:41] Oh, no. No. Abraham was a Jew. No, he
[16:42] wasn't.
[16:43] The word Jew never come into existence
[16:46] until you coming over to about uh second
[16:48] Jude somewhere in there. Uh I mean Jude.
[16:52] When you come into the book of Jude, you
[16:54] pick up the word Jew. Because Abraham
[16:58] was a gentile. He was just a nation. It
[17:00] was a people. There was no set people at
[17:04] that time chosen to be set aside. Okay,
[17:08] that's what it come to Abraham to
[17:10] explain that
[17:12] of the coming in of the Jews to the
[17:15] point of being the children of God.
[17:17] All right. But see, are you following me
[17:20] then? See, here's the Apostle Paul. Now,
[17:23] he's explaining to the Jews,
[17:25] right?
[17:26] Now, not the natural Jew.
[17:28] That's right.
[17:28] That's right.
[17:29] He's not explaining to the natural Jew.
[17:32] That's right.
[17:34] Amen.
[17:35] About the coming in of the Gentiles. He
[17:37] did. He didn't have to. They wouldn't
[17:39] They wouldn't even believe it anyway.
[17:40] That's right.
[17:41] You understand what I'm getting at? They
[17:43] just laugh at Paul when he'd say, "But
[17:45] didn't you know that the Bible spoke of
[17:47] the coming in of the Gentiles?" What do
[17:49] you mean? We don't have no Gentiles in
[17:51] our group. You know,
[17:54] but see, here comes a mystery coming
[17:56] into view to the Apostle Paul and him
[17:59] speaking to that the very people he was
[18:02] talking to
[18:05] was not the outcast
[18:07] Jew.
[18:08] That's right.
[18:08] Amen.
[18:09] Not the the people out out there. It was
[18:12] the people that he was walking among
[18:17] Peter and them.
[18:19] Yep. Amen.
[18:24] The natural Jew
[18:26] was not what Peter and was not what Paul
[18:29] was trying to convert.
[18:31] That's right.
[18:33] He was not trying to convert the natural
[18:35] Jew to a Gentile dispensation.
[18:38] No.
[18:39] He knew better than that.
[18:41] But he was trying to bring a mystery
[18:45] that showed the Gentiles coming in was
[18:48] the great mystery that the Bible had
[18:50] spoken of the great things that had been
[18:53] types and shadows all the way through.
[18:54] Yes.
[18:57] But he was trying to explain to the Jew,
[19:01] the spiritual Jew.
[19:04] Now put it that way. To the children of
[19:07] Is not the natural children of Israel,
[19:10] but to the bornag again Christians.
[19:13] Amen.
[19:16] Now, are you picking it up?
[19:17] Yes.
[19:20] He was talking to born again Christians.
[19:23] Amen.
[19:25] He was talking to the people of that
[19:28] day. That was the bride of Christ.
[19:30] Amen.
[19:32] They couldn't understand why Paul would
[19:34] come up and he said, "Look,
[19:37] he said,"All right, y'all got this.
[19:40] You're doing it." But said, "Lo, I turn
[19:42] to the Gentiles."
[19:45] They didn't understand why he was doing
[19:47] those things, right?
[19:50] Because they couldn't see that it turned
[19:52] that way. They didn't all flock up and
[19:54] say, "Hey, let's go with Paul. Let's go
[19:56] with him and and take it to the Jew uh
[19:58] to the Gentiles." you know, the the
[20:00] message of the Gentiles to the Jews.
[20:02] Let's take it and bring them all in.
[20:04] No,
[20:07] no. They actually said, "Paul,
[20:10] yeah,
[20:11] you can take Barnabas or one of one John
[20:14] Mark on one of them one time and and
[20:16] then finally he hadn't even turned away
[20:17] from them."
[20:20] See, everything Paul tried to do, if you
[20:22] understand what I'm getting at,
[20:24] everything he tried to do looked like it
[20:27] was a failure. That's right.
[20:30] Because he tried to bring to the Jews,
[20:34] the bornag again Christians,
[20:38] the born again Christian, not the
[20:39] natural Jew, not the natural, you know,
[20:42] Jew.
[20:44] He was trying to get the spiritual Jew
[20:47] to see what it is.
[20:48] Amen.
[20:52] Of the coming in of the dispensation
[20:56] of the Gentiles. Amen.
[21:01] Which would be nations.
[21:04] All right.
[21:05] You know, all right. Forgive me for
[21:08] coughing, but
[21:10] I have to
[21:12] get that.
[21:14] I hope when they go through and cut in
[21:16] their shoulder, they find out what's
[21:18] wrong with my coffin.
[21:20] I'm not worried about my shoulder. Okay.
[21:23] My coughing is what I'm getting
[21:25] concerned about, but I can't help that.
[21:28] All right. Are you picking up what I'm
[21:31] talking about?
[21:31] Yes.
[21:34] Why is it so a drastic thing that here's
[21:39] Paul pulling away
[21:43] from the Jew of the born again
[21:45] Christians?
[21:50] That was who he was constantly fighting
[21:52] and trying to explain.
[21:58] He was trying to explain to the born
[22:00] again Christian.
[22:04] He wasn't trying to explain to the
[22:06] natural Jew
[22:08] about a Gentiles coming in. They didn't
[22:10] listen to him anyway.
[22:13] It was the people he was preaching to.
[22:15] Right.
[22:16] It was the people that was supposed to
[22:18] have been accepting him.
[22:20] Yes.
[22:21] Right.
[22:23] But instead, they turn away from him.
[22:26] They walk away. And Paul said, "Okay,
[22:30] you count yourself unworthy of the
[22:32] gospel."
[22:33] Now, who's he talking to? Not Come on,
[22:35] get the story. He's not talking to the
[22:38] natural Jew, Kyus, and and all of those
[22:41] others. They had done turned it all
[22:43] down.
[22:46] So he turns to the Gentiles
[22:49] and he turns back looking to the Jews
[22:51] and he says, "You count yourself
[22:53] unworthy."
[22:57] What do you mean?
[22:59] You count yourself unworthy
[23:02] of the gospel. And they were the ones
[23:05] that was trying to preach the gospel.
[23:10] He said, "You count yourself unworthy."
[23:12] He said, "Lo, I turn to the Gentiles.
[23:15] I'll go to a people that will accept
[23:17] it."
[23:21] And that's what it done. And that was
[23:23] Paul's problems until the day that he
[23:26] died.
[23:26] Amen.
[23:27] He never could go back to those Jews and
[23:30] join back in with them and and be in
[23:33] constant fellowship and he every time he
[23:36] went around them he was in trouble
[23:38] with the natural spiritual the bornagain
[23:42] Christians.
[23:43] Are you listening?
[23:44] Yes.
[23:48] Come on. Get the background. Get the
[23:50] story into your mind.
[23:53] Paul was not trying to convert Caiaphas
[23:56] and and this one and that one, all of
[23:58] the natural Jews.
[24:03] He was not trying to do that.
[24:04] He was trying to get to those people
[24:06] that claimed they were a part of the
[24:09] body of Christ.
[24:13] And the more he preached, the harder it
[24:15] got.
[24:19] A mystery.
[24:22] is going on
[24:26] a great mystery
[24:28] that mankind could never follow. Sure,
[24:30] we followed it. That's what I'm saying.
[24:32] I'm not throwing no stone to the back.
[24:33] That's where I came from. That's what
[24:34] I'm saying it.
[24:37] We taught the engrafting of the
[24:39] Gentiles. We taught to bring it in. We
[24:42] taught the the uh uh
[24:46] you know what you call engrafting, where
[24:47] you put one of them and engraft into the
[24:49] other. And they they never could get it
[24:51] straight because I I tried to get them
[24:54] the people to see that back then the
[24:56] same as I do now. If you're going out to
[24:59] graft in to a a wild olive tree and a
[25:03] you know a a tame olive tree,
[25:07] you don't want the tame olive tree to be
[25:09] in the ground.
[25:12] You want the wild olive tree put into
[25:15] the ground
[25:18] where the tame can be engrafted in and
[25:21] it can come forth and produce
[25:24] because if you don't the roots are going
[25:26] to die
[25:28] and come on church, we're our roots are
[25:30] Jewish.
[25:33] That was the one thing Paul couldn't get
[25:34] them to understand.
[25:35] That's right.
[25:36] That's what I'm trying to get you to
[25:38] understand. Paul was trying to get them
[25:40] to see that their roots were Jewish.
[25:42] That's
[25:42] right.
[25:43] That that was what was spoke of all the
[25:45] way down through there and bringing it
[25:47] forth,
[25:48] but they couldn't see it.
[25:51] They couldn't follow it.
[25:54] They were looking at their own selves.
[25:57] And no matter if they were even born
[25:59] again Christians,
[26:01] I'm not saying that he's wouldn't get my
[26:04] point. He was trying to speak to those.
[26:07] And finally it just got to the point he
[26:10] just had to leave.
[26:13] And he says, "You count yourself
[26:14] unworthy of the gospel." He said, "I'm
[26:16] turning to the Gentiles."
[26:20] And you know what? He became
[26:22] the first church age messenger.
[26:27] You know, at Ephesus.
[26:28] Amen.
[26:29] You know what he became?
[26:32] From the great apostle Paul came the
[26:35] writing of the New Testament,
[26:39] right?
[26:41] You got Peter, one art, one little book
[26:44] about it. You got John one.
[26:48] You got one of the others and you you
[26:50] got a half a dozen of the rest of them.
[26:52] And here's the Apostle Paul
[26:55] bringing the entire gospel
[26:58] out into the open. Amen.
[27:03] He had a mystery.
[27:07] He knew why he was called and he knew
[27:10] why they couldn't understand him.
[27:15] But see, I don't think you're getting
[27:16] what I'm trying to to bring forth. I I'm
[27:20] talking about the Apostle Paul was
[27:22] actually trying to tell the Christians.
[27:25] That's true.
[27:26] He was preaching to Peter and James and
[27:28] John and all of the Christians.
[27:35] And here they turned so much against him
[27:37] until he has to just leave.
[27:42] And all he was doing was trying to
[27:43] preach one thing, the engrafting of the
[27:46] Gentiles.
[27:48] But he was trying to bring it the way
[27:50] that the scripture was bringing it.
[27:52] That it would be a mystery. That's
[27:54] right.
[27:56] That mankind would never be able to
[27:57] follow that mystery.
[27:59] Exactly.
[28:02] That's right.
[28:04] He said, "Oh yeah, we understand the
[28:06] engrafting of the Gentiles. We
[28:07] understand this. We understand that
[28:09] about do we?"
[28:10] Yes.
[28:16] Okay.
[28:17] Trying to get just a thought.
[28:25] Just
[28:26] think about what I'm trying to bring.
[28:30] I didn't mean to go this way, but that's
[28:31] all right. I didn't know I was going
[28:33] this way.
[28:36] You probably wonder which way I'm going.
[28:39] Okay.
[28:41] I'm trying to get you to see one thing.
[28:44] When you're dealing with a mystery,
[28:48] just remember you're dealing with a
[28:51] supernatural element
[28:54] that is sealed to mankind,
[28:58] right?
[29:04] That whole Bible
[29:06] is sealed to mankind
[29:12] and could not under be understood
[29:17] until the last days
[29:25] then according to Revelations 10
[29:30] there would be a mighty angel come
[29:32] forth. That's right.
[29:33] Now, Brother Brandham explains that. So,
[29:35] you do what you want to with it. He said
[29:37] that mighty angel was the same as
[29:39] Revelations one.
[29:41] That wouldn't brother Brandham.
[29:45] That's not that mighty angel.
[29:49] The mighty angel there he said was
[29:51] Revelations one.
[29:54] He said it's the same. Now, so you do,
[29:56] you know,
[29:58] I'm not trying to be derogatory to
[30:00] anybody, but I'm trying to put it in
[30:01] truthful line to where we can
[30:03] understand.
[30:06] That prophet when he brought his
[30:08] message, he was doing fine through up
[30:10] and down in the times. He understood the
[30:12] engrafting of the Gentile. He understood
[30:15] the teachings of adoption and the things
[30:17] that he was bringing forth.
[30:21] But then one day,
[30:25] It wound up being another book come into
[30:27] view or a book came into view.
[30:31] A book that would be a mystery,
[30:37] a mystery
[30:39] and it would be called the mystery
[30:43] cuz it would seal up the whole Bible
[30:46] in the mystery.
[30:51] You say, "Well, what are you talking
[30:52] about?" The mystery.
[30:56] How long have I been preaching on
[30:59] Hebrews
[31:01] 11:40?
[31:05] The day without us cannot be made
[31:07] perfect.
[31:08] Amen.
[31:10] Now, it's been about eight, seven, eight
[31:12] messages
[31:14] trying to get you to see a point.
[31:16] Yes.
[31:19] They, the apostle Paul
[31:23] was putting everybody
[31:26] in the now, may I say it in the right
[31:28] way,
[31:29] everybody that was in the religious
[31:31] realm
[31:33] would be related to
[31:37] Hebrews 11:40,
[31:39] right?
[31:43] There would be a great mystery
[31:46] that we'd be able to understand
[31:50] why the apostle Paul said they without
[31:53] us
[31:56] cannot be complete.
[32:00] Cuz see there was a mystery.
[32:02] Amen.
[32:06] What is the mystery?
[32:11] Who's God waiting on?
[32:17] Oh,
[32:19] we put a couple of messages and and
[32:22] emphasized it very heavily that your
[32:26] prophet said that God was waiting on me
[32:29] and you.
[32:35] Yeah, but I thought we was waiting on
[32:36] him. Well, see, that's where we think we
[32:38] we think we got it figured out. And
[32:40] that's a good truth. That's fine. You're
[32:42] waiting on him to tell you to do and
[32:44] all. That's right. But when it come to
[32:46] the prophet one day, what did he say?
[32:48] He said, "Don't cry no more."
[32:51] He said, "Speak and go forward."
[32:54] Stop your sniffling like a baby.
[32:58] Get up and say it and move forward.
[33:01] And preach the mystery.
[33:03] Amen.
[33:04] That you come to bring.
[33:08] was brother Brandham's ministry. When
[33:10] did it begin? Not in the 40s.
[33:13] That was return of the faith of the
[33:15] fathers.
[33:17] Right. That's right.
[33:20] Come on. He said not in the years of
[33:22] preparation. Come on. Do I need to go
[33:23] over it and over it? He said not in the
[33:25] years of preparation. That's right.
[33:27] But said when he begins to sound.
[33:28] Amen. Amen.
[33:32] See, then the prophet there in 63, right
[33:34] into that period of time, two and three,
[33:37] as he begins to go into it, what's he
[33:39] doing? He's preaching. What's he
[33:41] preaching? Revelations 10.
[33:46] That in the days of the voice of the
[33:48] seventh angel
[33:49] when he begins to sound that there'd be
[33:51] a mystery,
[33:57] that would be made known.
[33:58] Amen.
[34:01] a mystery
[34:03] that would be made known.
[34:06] And he says
[34:09] Revelations 10 is the same as
[34:12] Revelations 1:13. Right in there
[34:18] where it said you seen one standing in
[34:20] the midst of seven golden candles like
[34:22] unto the s son of man g about the palps
[34:25] with a golden golden girdle.
[34:28] Amen.
[34:28] And brother Brmond says that's the same
[34:30] as Revelations.
[34:31] Amen.
[34:33] 1 13 I believe 13, right? 12 or 13.
[34:42] What mystery was there in the scripture
[34:44] there?
[34:46] What mystery was laying in the
[34:47] scriptures that no light had ever shined
[34:50] on?
[34:52] Is that the way he describes it?
[34:55] He describes a dream or something of a
[34:57] man in a pyramid mountain and taking a
[35:00] bar and whipping off the top and looking
[35:02] down in. And
[35:03] he said there's things down in there
[35:05] that light had never shined on.
[35:10] Now he knows what he's come to do.
[35:12] Amen.
[35:14] As he says in in uh spoken words
[35:17] original seed,
[35:19] he gets over into his message and he's
[35:21] bringing it out and he says, "As of yet
[35:23] Malachi 4 is not fulfilled." You
[35:25] remember that?
[35:30] There he's standing bringing the message
[35:32] and he declares as of yet Malachi 4 is
[35:35] not fulfilled.
[35:38] So there was a great mystery.
[35:42] Amen.
[35:46] This message is a mystery.
[35:48] That's exactly right.
[35:49] Amen.
[35:50] You can't explain it to nobody. That's
[35:52] right.
[35:54] It can only be revealed. It can't be
[35:56] explained.
[36:00] There's no way to explain this message.
[36:03] You say, "Oh, it's the revelation of
[36:04] Jesus Christ." Oh, okay. Wonderful.
[36:08] But remember that was in the Bible.
[36:10] The Baptist could read that,
[36:13] but it didn't mean they could understand
[36:14] it.
[36:15] You and I could read it where we were
[36:17] at, but it didn't mean we could
[36:18] understand it.
[36:23] But in the days of the seventh angel, in
[36:26] his time of his ministry, there would be
[36:29] a great mystery.
[36:30] Amen.
[36:34] I hope you understand, especially to you
[36:37] that have been in the message for quite
[36:38] a while, of what I'm trying to explain.
[36:43] I know it's it's it's clicking. I know
[36:45] it's it's hitting and you you need to
[36:48] think about it.
[36:50] But see, there's a mystery
[36:55] that light had never shined on until
[36:57] this day.
[37:02] And the prophet's message began there in
[37:04] the in the 60s in the 62 63.
[37:08] He tells you rapture message and not in
[37:11] the years of preparation.
[37:13] That's right. We said when he began to
[37:15] sound,
[37:22] you say, "Oh, his message was back there
[37:23] in the for." No, that wasn't his
[37:25] message. That was the faith of the
[37:26] fathers.
[37:27] That's right.
[37:28] That was what the disciples had already
[37:30] preached.
[37:36] That's what he says.
[37:43] Have I become your enemy because I tell
[37:44] you the truth
[37:46] or at least try to tell you the truth?
[37:52] You see, until this end time, there was
[37:54] a great mystery sealed up in the Bible.
[37:57] But if you ask now, you ask the
[37:59] religious world what that mystery was,
[38:01] it was engrafting of the Gentiles.
[38:03] That's right.
[38:04] They could tell you that that it was the
[38:06] engrafting or the bringing in of the
[38:08] Gentiles into the kingdom.
[38:10] Yes.
[38:10] Right.
[38:14] But see, Paul was trying to explain
[38:16] that.
[38:19] About 80, 40, 50, right in there
[38:21] somewhere.
[38:25] He was trying to explain what was taking
[38:27] place.
[38:33] It says in type. It says your kingdom is
[38:35] going to be taken from you
[38:37] and given to the Gentiles. That's
[38:40] right.
[38:44] The Gentiles would accept the kingdom of
[38:46] God.
[38:47] Yes.
[38:47] Amen.
[38:52] And if it would, it would be a great
[38:53] mystery, a great time. What is the
[38:56] mystery?
[39:00] The mystery is who's God's waiting on?
[39:09] Come on. Who's God waiting on?
[39:12] The prophet said he's waiting on me and
[39:14] you.
[39:16] Is that a problem
[39:19] to know that he's waiting on us?
[39:24] Well, what are we supposed to do? Just
[39:26] what I've tried to preach for 10 or 15
[39:28] sermons. We're supposed to try to bring
[39:31] this message to the point that it will
[39:33] draw everything to the message.
[39:36] Exactly.
[39:45] See, they without us cannot be made
[39:46] perfect.
[39:47] Amen.
[39:48] You realize that Paul listen.
[39:53] So you can say, "Well, okay, it was a
[39:55] time that Paul went off and died, then
[39:57] he become one of us." That's fine, but
[39:59] that ain't the point.
[40:00] That's right.
[40:03] That ain't the point,
[40:04] right?
[40:06] The point is Paul said
[40:10] that there was going to be a group of
[40:13] people
[40:17] that would bring forth the gospel in the
[40:20] correct order. That's right.
[40:23] and fulfill the mystery
[40:26] of the entire Bible
[40:29] and bring a rapture. That's right.
[40:36] You say, "Did Paul say that?" Well, what
[40:39] do you think he's talking about?
[40:42] Cuz you're not listening.
[40:45] See, Paul was talking to born again
[40:48] Christians,
[40:51] trying to get born again Christians to
[40:53] see
[40:56] that all of those people, Hebrews 11,
[40:58] were great warriors of faith, great
[41:01] times and all, but none of them had come
[41:04] to the place
[41:06] that the world be waiting on them.
[41:14] But Paul stood there in a group
[41:19] and said they're waiting on us.
[41:26] God said they're waiting on us.
[41:29] See to do what?
[41:33] To complete
[41:35] or finish and bring the message to a
[41:38] position. Amen.
[41:40] That we could believe it.
[41:43] See, the world is waiting on you and me.
[41:51] No, it's waiting on this. Waiting on
[41:55] God's waiting on me and you to step out
[41:57] on what we got.
[42:02] What do you think he's waiting on?
[42:05] Well, he he he's waiting on it. No, he's
[42:07] waiting on that. He's waiting on this to
[42:09] do that and waiting on that. You can try
[42:11] to come up with all of your ideas. I'
[42:13] got to this has got to happen, that's
[42:14] got to happen. But why not just say what
[42:16] the prophet said?
[42:24] Why not say it that way and see what we
[42:26] can do with it? Let's take a few. Okay.
[42:32] Go ahead. Number one, brother. Pull it
[42:34] up.
[42:40] that we would see Jesus
[42:43] 1962 pull it on up to you can read
[42:46] what's in between the Trump and the
[42:47] different thing as the church like the
[42:50] pyramid comes into a point so as the
[42:53] church in the days of Luther days of
[42:55] Wesley days of Pentecostal he never
[42:58] rejected none of those
[42:59] that's right amen
[43:00] I wish that would finally get into the
[43:02] mind of the people,
[43:06] big great men. He was down at Lula, I
[43:09] mean Gills when we were eating together
[43:11] and he he said them Pentecostals, they
[43:13] didn't have nothing.
[43:16] I said, "Brother Br said they had the
[43:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost."
[43:20] He said, "Oh, they didn't have nothing."
[43:22] And see, you sat a lot of you sat right
[43:24] here that night and heard him say it
[43:26] again right here.
[43:29] Of
[43:31] course, it was the big name guy.
[43:38] I told him twice
[43:41] that he was wrong. Of course, you know
[43:43] what he thought of me. That's all right.
[43:44] I no problem. I ain't trying to be
[43:46] nothing. I was just trying to tell him
[43:47] what the prophet said cuz this is what I
[43:49] was telling him. And just before the
[43:51] headstone comes into it, that church
[43:54] now, not brother Brandham, get that.
[43:56] We're going to lay it flat like that.
[43:58] You say the world's waiting on brother
[44:00] Brandham. Show me that in the Bible.
[44:06] I'll show you where he's at in the body
[44:08] of Christ. And the body of Christ is
[44:10] what God is waiting on.
[44:12] So now, if you don't want to take it
[44:13] that way, then just misunderstand me
[44:16] about what I'm saying. He's in the body
[44:19] of Christ.
[44:22] Without him, we can't be made perfect
[44:24] because he's in the body of Christ.
[44:26] Right.
[44:28] But he's waiting on us to come now
[44:31] to the right place. Cuz listen to him
[44:33] now. Just before the headstone comes
[44:35] into it, that church has to be honed so
[44:39] perfect till the same ministry that he
[44:42] did here, his same spirit,
[44:47] so predominant, however you pronounce
[44:49] that word,
[44:50] will bring that same body right into it
[44:53] and resurrect the whole thing.
[44:59] What?
[45:02] Something's going to happen and
[45:03] resurrect the whole thing.
[45:09] What's it going to be? Go ahead to the
[45:10] next one.
[45:12] Standing in the gap.
[45:17] But the cap on the period is never put
[45:19] on. I've been to Cairo and everything.
[45:20] Okay. Because it was a cornerstone. It
[45:22] was a headstone in the church. It was
[45:24] the cornerstone.
[45:25] And because that's foundation, apostles,
[45:27] prophets, Jesus Christ being the chief
[45:29] cornerstone. Okay, come on. We got the
[45:31] scriptures, right? And the script in the
[45:34] church was the cornerstone and the full
[45:36] church it was the headstone.
[45:38] So it never did come. It was rejected
[45:40] Christ and it will come. Amen. And I
[45:43] believe that when it's coming that the
[45:45] church will shape into a place from
[45:48] justification under Luther,
[45:50] sanctification under Wesley, Pentecostal
[45:52] message will bring the church to such a
[45:55] minority and a ministry will be among
[45:58] those people till it'll be exactly the
[46:02] same ministry that Jesus Christ did.
[46:05] That'll bring Christ
[46:08] and catch the whole thing away.
[46:11] The same ministry. That's right.
[46:16] All right.
[46:19] The same ministry
[46:21] that Jesus Christ had has got to be
[46:22] here. But where in the church?
[46:24] Amen.
[46:28] Now, come on, church. I'm not trying to
[46:30] be derogatory to anybody. I never have
[46:33] been, and I've always been accused of
[46:34] it, but I never have. I've always told
[46:36] you what I believe.
[46:38] I've never been backed off from you or
[46:40] anything. I tell you what I believe.
[46:46] We've had a message to come to bring us
[46:51] the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[46:55] Yes, sir.
[46:55] But you and I have got to be the
[46:57] message.
[46:58] Amen.
[47:00] Amen.
[47:01] That's right.
[47:02] That's all I've ever preached.
[47:04] That's all I've ever believed. That's
[47:06] all I've ever taught. That you and I
[47:08] have got to be the message.
[47:09] That's right. Amen.
[47:13] All right. So then everything's
[47:15] dependent upon you and me.
[47:17] I hope that's following through.
[47:20] Everything's dependent upon the little
[47:22] bride of Christ to become the word.
[47:24] Yeah. But I just don't see Jesus. Open
[47:26] your eyes.
[47:27] Amen.
[47:29] Uh do this for me. Wade goes going up.
[47:32] Come back this way. You know, he use
[47:34] that point like that. Won't you use a
[47:36] point like this? Just stop breathing for
[47:37] a second.
[47:39] Just hold your breath.
[47:47] You hold it for a whole second, don't
[47:49] you? You can't even You think you held
[47:51] it for a minute there.
[47:54] They ain't a person in this building can
[47:56] hold your breath for one minute.
[47:59] I challenge you.
[48:03] You say, "Yes, I can." Let's see you try
[48:05] it.
[48:07] to you think in a half a half of a
[48:09] minute you done win a whole minute. It
[48:11] ain't. Get you watch and try to find
[48:12] out. I'm just not I'm silly. I know
[48:15] that. But I'm just trying to make a
[48:16] point.
[48:19] See, the world is waiting on you and I.
[48:25] It's waiting on the body of Christ.
[48:29] And brother Brandham is in the body of
[48:31] Christ.
[48:34] No problem.
[48:35] That's right. I've always taught it that
[48:37] way because I've always believed it that
[48:39] way.
[48:40] Brother Brandham is in the body of
[48:41] Christ.
[48:43] The body of Christ is not complete
[48:45] without him.
[48:49] So you think I'm derogatory, throwing
[48:51] off on you. No, I'm trying to tell the
[48:53] truth.
[48:55] Amen.
[48:56] But tell it to you as a mystery.
[48:58] Okay?
[48:59] Because that's the mystery. How are you
[49:02] going to get the people of this message
[49:03] to believe it? that the bride is what
[49:06] God is waiting on.
[49:08] Amen.
[49:08] Amen.
[49:09] That's what he says. Come on. Go ahead
[49:12] to the next one. Watch one.
[49:16] What of the night?
[49:20] No signal. Okay.
[49:24] I'll read till I get it up.
[49:28] But what's he doing? He's reflecting the
[49:31] same light of the sun that went down
[49:33] years ago and is rising again.
[49:36] Amen.
[49:37] What is that true church's ministry now?
[49:42] What is the true church's ministry?
[49:47] What is the true church's ministry?
[49:49] That's right.
[49:52] The ministry that the church will be the
[49:54] ma ministry of the sun because it is a
[49:57] reflection of the same sun power and the
[50:00] same sunlight
[50:02] that the world would know when the sun
[50:04] rises
[50:07] what it'll look like.
[50:10] What about it?
[50:14] The same ministry
[50:17] is what we're supposed to be concerned
[50:19] with.
[50:22] Yeah, but I just don't see it. Uh, you
[50:24] know, there's people out here, they do
[50:26] this, they do that. That's all right.
[50:31] I'm looking for one thing like we was
[50:33] did last night. Brother Ryan asked a
[50:34] question about it and said, "How does it
[50:37] turn out to be?" And the very first
[50:39] question was ways answered it. Somebody
[50:40] else's answer. There was like three
[50:42] answers come forth at one time. Said,
[50:44] "It's the word."
[50:48] What is the answer? Amen.
[50:50] The word.
[50:51] Amen.
[50:52] What is the word?
[50:54] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[50:55] and forever.
[50:57] That's the word.
[51:00] What is that? That's the mystery that's
[51:01] been hid.
[51:03] Amen.
[51:07] It's a hidden mystery
[51:09] that people can't see it as in the
[51:11] church.
[51:17] That's what your prophet said it would
[51:18] be,
[51:19] right?
[51:20] Okay, go ahead.
[51:24] What about it
[51:27] now? It's not the church. It's the Holy
[51:30] Spirit, the coming of the son of God
[51:33] that's reflecting in the church that's
[51:36] proving his power.
[51:38] He's doing exactly the same thing, the
[51:40] same ministry he did when he left the
[51:42] earth. He's here tonight doing the same
[51:46] thing reflecting his coming.
[51:49] He said, "Well, I was in brother Brown."
[51:51] Amen.
[51:52] I ain't got no problem.
[51:55] He said he was talking about himself.
[51:56] Amen. I ain't got no problem.
[52:00] He said he's here.
[52:02] Amen.
[52:02] He was there doing it.
[52:05] But did it stop when he left?
[52:11] I thought it was supposed to went into
[52:12] the body of Christ.
[52:15] Maybe Paul knew what he's talking about
[52:16] background.
[52:19] He's here tonight doing the same thing.
[52:22] Reflecting his coming, reflecting what?
[52:24] Not the palenness of the moon, but
[52:27] reflecting the same signs what comes to
[52:30] pass. Not the moon, the star, the moon,
[52:32] the star of the earth, but the coming of
[52:34] the sun. What is it? How about Go ahead
[52:37] to the next one. Let me get a few then
[52:39] real quick. The same ministry that the
[52:41] son went down in, the same light he went
[52:44] down in is coming again in the
[52:47] resurrection power. And the morning star
[52:50] is reflecting that light when we cry,
[52:53] "Watchmen, what of the night?" What
[52:55] about it?
[52:58] What about it?
[53:02] Could it be that we do like the people
[53:04] back there that I hope you understand
[53:06] what I'm saying? Those people back there
[53:09] were the born again Christians of the
[53:11] day.
[53:13] But they couldn't understand Paul.
[53:14] That's right.
[53:18] Why did he leave the Gentile I mean
[53:20] leave the Jews
[53:22] when he knew they were the people of
[53:24] God.
[53:27] But he's seen they turned it down. Amen.
[53:32] Right.
[53:32] That's right.
[53:35] Yep.
[53:35] They were claiming Jesus Christ to be
[53:37] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[53:39] And Paul was saying, "You're turning it
[53:41] down."
[53:41] That's right.
[53:43] He said, "You count yourself unworthy of
[53:45] the very gospel? Whose gospel? The
[53:48] gospel he'd been trying to preach."
[53:53] And he said, "I turned to the Gentiles.
[53:59] I'll just go with them.
[54:05] What about it?
[54:08] Have we taken it in the right way?
[54:12] The same ministry.
[54:16] The same ministry Christ had in his
[54:20] church to in is in his church tonight.
[54:24] Go ahead. That's number four. the
[54:26] unconditional
[54:28] uh covenant.
[54:30] The same way, the same ministry
[54:33] Christ had is in his church tonight.
[54:36] Same sign, same wonders, same spirit,
[54:39] same kind
[54:41] of works that Jesus did here on earth.
[54:45] The church has to do the same thing.
[54:56] Now, does somebody want to read that?
[54:57] You want to read that next verse or you
[54:59] want to leave it out?
[55:05] Cuz when I read it, you'll be wanting to
[55:06] leave it out.
[55:12] If it's not,
[55:16] if it's not here, he's saying the same
[55:19] signs, the same wonders, the same
[55:20] spirit, same kind of works that Jesus
[55:23] did here on earth, the church has to do
[55:26] the same thing.
[55:28] If it's not,
[55:31] it is not the seed of Abraham.
[55:38] It's not the church of Jesus Christ.
[55:41] Can't be.
[55:46] Let's read.
[55:53] Do you believe Jesus Christ is the same
[55:55] yesterday, today, and forever? Well, now
[55:57] in a way, brother Run said, "Now there's
[55:58] no such thing as saying in a way." Now,
[56:00] come on, get that off.
[56:06] Well, Brother Dale, you're against this.
[56:08] I've never been against nothing.
[56:13] I stand for where I stand and I've
[56:15] always stood on one thing and I've never
[56:18] changed my thoughts.
[56:21] Are you looking for brother Brandham to
[56:23] come back? Yes, sir.
[56:28] But I'm also looking for all the born
[56:30] again Christians to come.
[56:35] That's right.
[56:37] So I don't have no problem.
[56:39] Is brother Brandon coming first? That's
[56:41] fine with me. I don't I don't have no
[56:43] problem.
[56:46] But if the bride don't come forth,
[56:50] she's not the children of Abraham.
[56:52] That's right.
[56:53] That's just what we read.
[57:01] You see that a way you can say and stay
[57:03] like I have for 50 years and said, "I
[57:06] declare it."
[57:10] I'm a firm believer in a return
[57:12] ministry. Not the kind that other
[57:14] people's got.
[57:16] Amen.
[57:19] I'm a firm believer in the return
[57:21] ministry.
[57:23] I'm a firm believer in the Apostle Paul
[57:25] standing on this earth one day.
[57:31] I'm a firm believer in brother Random
[57:33] standing on this earth.
[57:36] Yeah.
[57:38] What takes place that's up to him and
[57:40] God.
[57:42] We shouldn't even have any discussion
[57:43] about it. That's that's where I've
[57:45] always stood.
[57:47] I was asked that question and I said
[57:49] made the statement then that I make now.
[57:53] If brother Brandham come right out here
[57:55] in front of this building and preach a
[57:57] service,
[58:00] most of you would not know what he's
[58:02] saying.
[58:06] Uhoh.
[58:08] See, there's where I go and you get your
[58:11] feelings hurt. Because you see, I just
[58:13] took it off of anything of thinking
[58:16] about brother Brandham. I just took it
[58:18] all and put it right in our own lap
[58:22] because that was the statement I made.
[58:24] If brother Brandham come right out here
[58:26] in front of this building, you wouldn't
[58:28] know what he's talking about. Why? Cuz
[58:30] you don't know what he's talking about.
[58:32] I hope a sister don't get mad at us. You
[58:35] know,
[58:36] we were discussing something last night
[58:41] in the Bible,
[58:44] and I wonder how many of you besides
[58:45] that person would even admit to it.
[58:49] Where did they get the gold? Where did
[58:51] they get the gold to make the golden
[58:53] calif?
[58:58] How many of you remember scripturally
[59:00] where they got it from?
[59:03] Right.
[59:04] Where did they get it? They got it from
[59:07] the men and the women that were the
[59:09] children of Israel that was wanting a
[59:11] gold calf,
[59:14] right?
[59:17] See, most people don't even know that.
[59:21] You mean is the children of Israel? The
[59:23] children of Israel wore earbobs,
[59:26] earrings, and bracelets and all kind of
[59:28] thing. And when it got time to be
[59:30] needed, Aaron said, "Get me all the gold
[59:33] you can get." And they just took all
[59:35] that out of their ears and all around
[59:37] her necks and everything and went and
[59:38] laid it down. And that's what we was all
[59:40] laughing last night. How many remember
[59:42] what the Bible said
[59:47] when Moses got back over there? He said,
[59:49] "Aaron, what took place?"
[59:53] Aaron said, "Now you know these people
[59:56] and you know how hard-hearted they are."
[59:59] He said, "You know their their ideas and
[1:00:01] their things." And said, "All I" He
[1:00:04] said, Mo Moses said, "Aaron, what'd you
[1:00:06] do?" He said, "All I done was just took
[1:00:09] them earrings and gathered them up in a
[1:00:12] pot
[1:00:14] and dumped them over in the fire and
[1:00:15] said, "Out jump the calf."
[1:00:22] what the Bible says.
[1:00:25] Out jump the Kath.
[1:00:30] You say, "Well,
[1:00:32] I didn't know they had earrings." And
[1:00:34] Well, you ought to read your Bible,
[1:00:36] right?
[1:00:37] Yeah, but I thought earrings was when
[1:00:39] you put them in your ear. Yeah, there's
[1:00:41] places to put them, but you don't need
[1:00:42] to do it. You know
[1:00:46] how many men have them in your nose?
[1:00:49] That's
[1:00:51] what you shaking your head for, brother
[1:00:52] Joe. He He did shake his head. Okay.
[1:00:57] Hooks in your nose. Boy, it ain't in
[1:01:00] mind.
[1:01:06] trying to make your life where you'll
[1:01:09] back off from being so set on me in such
[1:01:12] a hard way.
[1:01:14] Cuz listen church,
[1:01:17] if you understand what I'm getting at,
[1:01:20] the great Apostle Paul had to leave them
[1:01:23] born again Christian Jews,
[1:01:27] those that he was a part of to bring out
[1:01:30] and get a a dividing and started. He had
[1:01:34] to walk away from them and go to the
[1:01:36] Gentiles
[1:01:41] cuz he said, "You don't understand.
[1:01:46] You're still like Aaron that can take a
[1:01:49] bunch of gold and throw it in a pot and
[1:01:51] out jumps a calf."
[1:01:58] That was what Moses had to put up with.
[1:02:02] You know what I think about?
[1:02:06] And I'm still talking about me and you.
[1:02:09] Okay. I think about poor old brother
[1:02:12] Brandham and what he had to put up with
[1:02:17] trying to get the message to the people
[1:02:24] when all they could do was should a
[1:02:27] woman wear a garment pertaining to a
[1:02:29] man? Should a should this what should we
[1:02:32] do? You know
[1:02:40] why?
[1:02:43] Real quiet, isn't it? Cuz you know it's
[1:02:46] the truth
[1:02:48] that he couldn't get the people to see
[1:02:49] what he talking about.
[1:02:58] Okay.
[1:03:02] know that the same pillar of fire
[1:03:05] that led Israel,
[1:03:08] we know that the same ministry that
[1:03:10] accompanied Jesus Christ
[1:03:12] by that pillar of fire
[1:03:15] that had him anointed
[1:03:18] is accompanying the church
[1:03:21] today.
[1:03:22] That's right.
[1:03:23] Pull that up. That's number six.
[1:03:26] It's accompanying the church today.
[1:03:28] Amen.
[1:03:28] The same pillar of fire. Amen.
[1:03:32] But yet we don't see it. You know all we
[1:03:34] can see.
[1:03:36] There was a brother here years ago. He
[1:03:39] two or three different times he said
[1:03:41] there's a pillar of fire floating around
[1:03:42] the pull pit. I said don't get into
[1:03:45] that.
[1:03:46] Said don't get all tied up in it. Let it
[1:03:49] alone. He said but brother Dale said
[1:03:52] I've seen it two or three times. Said
[1:03:53] it's a halo a pillar of fire. Said it
[1:03:55] just floats around the pull pit.
[1:03:58] Well, nobody didn't want to talk about
[1:04:00] it.
[1:04:02] But you know what he said? He said, "I
[1:04:04] saw it again the other day, Brother
[1:04:06] Dale."
[1:04:09] And he said, "It left here at the pull
[1:04:11] pit and went down through the
[1:04:12] congregation."
[1:04:16] Two brothers jumped up.
[1:04:19] That's what it is. He's leaving the
[1:04:21] church. We better go with him.
[1:04:25] I said, "Go with him all you want to.
[1:04:27] I'm staying here.
[1:04:28] That's right.
[1:04:30] Because I'm declaring that he ain't
[1:04:32] leaving the building.
[1:04:33] I'm declaring one thing that I declared
[1:04:35] last night and I've always declared it.
[1:04:38] My goal, my whole life of everything
[1:04:41] that I've ever had
[1:04:44] is to get you to see Jesus Christ for
[1:04:46] your own personal experience.
[1:04:52] And I don't mean this wrong and
[1:04:54] derogatory, not brother Random's
[1:04:56] experience.
[1:04:58] That's right.
[1:04:59] Your own personal experience.
[1:05:03] Cuz if you'll see your own personal
[1:05:05] experience, you don't have to worry
[1:05:06] about his experience.
[1:05:07] You'll automatically know where it's at.
[1:05:12] Amen.
[1:05:14] I'm not trying to be derogatory against
[1:05:16] anybody believes in brother Brandham
[1:05:17] returning or anything. I've always told
[1:05:19] it like it is.
[1:05:21] I've never backed off from it.
[1:05:24] I've just always been plain.
[1:05:29] There's pictures downstairs that we've
[1:05:31] got of pictures of people that have
[1:05:33] passed away. Brother Brandon's pillar
[1:05:36] pictures in there. I want to see him as
[1:05:38] 18, 20 years old. I don't want to see
[1:05:40] him 50 years old.
[1:05:43] I don't want to see brother uh
[1:05:46] Tatum and Sister Tatum in their old age.
[1:05:50] I don't want to see Brother Molt and
[1:05:51] Sister Violet. I want to see them as I
[1:05:54] remembered them.
[1:05:57] Cuz then I'll know who they are.
[1:06:02] Amen.
[1:06:03] Then I'm looking for Jesus Christ.
[1:06:05] Amen.
[1:06:08] The same ministry,
[1:06:10] Amen.
[1:06:13] that the Lord Jesus Christ had is got to
[1:06:16] be here.
[1:06:17] I can still keep reading to you. How
[1:06:20] much do you want?
[1:06:22] The same ministry's got to be here.
[1:06:25] If it's not here, we're not the children
[1:06:27] of Abraham.
[1:06:30] If it's not here, where are we?
[1:06:32] That's right.
[1:06:35] You know, this is the one I like. Pull
[1:06:37] it on over to number nine.
[1:06:41] Number eight. Stop on that one.
[1:06:45] From Christ, the mystery of God reveal.
[1:06:48] Then the bride body must follow the
[1:06:50] head, for it is part of the of his
[1:06:52] resurrection
[1:06:54] and part of the mystery.
[1:07:00] It's impossible for it not to go.
[1:07:04] It's part of his three-fold mystery.
[1:07:07] Right.
[1:07:10] Revelations 10
[1:07:13] mystery.
[1:07:17] The bride is part of the mystery
[1:07:20] and must be revealed.
[1:07:24] Don't you fail. The body therefore
[1:07:26] cannot recognize any other headship but
[1:07:29] the word.
[1:07:35] Number nine.
[1:07:38] Put it up.
[1:07:41] See, if you were in the fornowledge of
[1:07:43] God, let me make sure.
[1:07:45] You were in the forn knowledge of God,
[1:07:47] then you're becoming a part of God. And
[1:07:49] the only way you can be a son of God or
[1:07:51] a daughter of God, you had to be a part
[1:07:53] of of God. And God isn't complete
[1:07:57] without you.
[1:08:00] Do you believe that? Amen.
[1:08:05] He's not complete without you.
[1:08:08] Well, I just don't believe it. Well,
[1:08:10] okay. See, then you're not part of him.
[1:08:12] I saw that.
[1:08:14] You're not the seed of Abraham. The seed
[1:08:17] of Abraham would say, "Amen."
[1:08:21] The prophet said he's he's not complete
[1:08:24] without you and me. Amen.
[1:08:29] That's right.
[1:08:34] Cuz we're part of him.
[1:08:39] Cuz once he gave you the new birth, that
[1:08:41] makes you and God one.
[1:08:45] Amen.
[1:08:47] I know. I believe it was brother
[1:08:49] Brandham and God one. Like a brother
[1:08:51] told me, he said,
[1:08:55] "This message of the third pull and the
[1:08:58] speaking of the word is only for brother
[1:09:00] Brandham and the Lord Jesus Christ."
[1:09:04] I wanted to get his
[1:09:07] Bible and tear out a few pages.
[1:09:12] Oh, that's sarcastic. No, it's truthful.
[1:09:16] man told me one time he said the gifts
[1:09:19] and the things according to what is
[1:09:21] Corinthians 13 he said that ought to be
[1:09:24] took out of the Bible. I said give it to
[1:09:27] me.
[1:09:31] He said I said give me your Bible.
[1:09:36] I said I'll take it out.
[1:09:39] Boy, he didn't let me have that Bible
[1:09:41] cuz I was going to rip it out.
[1:09:44] I ain't being sarcastic. If it if it
[1:09:46] ain't in there, if it ain't worth
[1:09:48] nothing, tear it out.
[1:09:52] No. If he's the same yesterday, today,
[1:09:55] and forever, there's a place for
[1:09:56] everything. Okay. Come on, musicians.
[1:09:58] Amen.
[1:09:59] Come on.
[1:10:02] Think on these things.
[1:10:06] The same ministry
[1:10:09] that the Lord Jesus Christ had.
[1:10:12] We know and believe it. Some of you sat
[1:10:15] and saw it. You saw the very signs and
[1:10:17] wonders to prove
[1:10:21] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:10:23] today, and forever.
[1:10:24] Yes.
[1:10:25] You saw the dead raised, the sick healed
[1:10:27] of great things.
[1:10:31] Did that die when the prophet went off
[1:10:33] the scene?
[1:10:43] But I believe he's waiting on me and
[1:10:45] you.
[1:10:45] Amen.
[1:10:48] I believe God is waiting on me and you.
[1:10:50] The prophet said, "Adoption time where
[1:10:53] God can pour into us his fullness and
[1:10:55] the baptism and fill every fiber of our
[1:10:57] being and take us in the rapture."
[1:11:02] Is that a hard thing to understand?
[1:11:05] No, it's understanding the truth.
[1:11:09] If I said something too offensive to you
[1:11:11] about what I've said about it, just
[1:11:13] remember I've said this all the whole
[1:11:15] time, so there couldn't be meaning it to
[1:11:16] you. You think I am, but it's not
[1:11:19] because I've taught this for 40 years.
[1:11:25] I hadn't changed in in what I've taught
[1:11:27] in 40 years. For how? Come and show me.
[1:11:33] No, I still believe he's the same
[1:11:35] yesterday, today, and forever. And I
[1:11:37] still believe he's right here tonight. I
[1:11:39] mean, today
[1:11:40] waiting on me and you to believe him.
[1:11:44] Because he's waiting on us. Go ahead,
[1:11:46] brother. What we got? Anybody have a
[1:11:47] need and then we'll go.
[1:11:49] Let's
[1:11:51] [Music]
[1:11:53] soul.
[1:11:57] What about him?
[1:12:00] Are you believing to be the shame
[1:12:03] of sin?
[1:12:09] The great immens
[1:12:11] [Music]
[1:12:16] give me a hand
[1:12:20] in Jesus name. We condemn this demon
[1:12:24] that's bothered our brother's stomach.
[1:12:26] In Jesus name we go.
[1:12:32] Go and say it and believe
[1:12:35] in Jesus.
[1:12:39] Father, we send these calls. Our brother
[1:12:42] has a name. You just be there in Jesus.
[1:12:47] Amen.
[1:12:49] Do you believe it?
[1:12:52] The son of the redeemer.
[1:12:59] Father, we send this prayer call sister
[1:13:03] for whatever the need she has. We
[1:13:06] believe you by your stripes, the
[1:13:09] person's healed or whatever it is.
[1:13:12] Whatever it takes place, it's all in you
[1:13:15] and we believe you. Thank you in Jesus
[1:13:18] name.
[1:13:19] Anybody else?
[1:13:21] Do you believe it?
[1:13:24] [Music]
[1:13:25] Ly God know somebody to believe him
[1:13:29] father.
[1:13:31] [Music]
[1:13:35] We know somebody to believe him.
[1:13:37] Hallelujah.
[1:13:42] Bless
[1:13:50] for he
[1:13:52] the greatness.
[1:13:59] [Music]
[1:14:02] Not looking for something to come.
[1:14:03] Looking at what's taking place.
[1:14:07] Oh, glory. See what we're doing. Glory
[1:14:11] hallelujah
[1:14:15] in Jesus name.
[1:14:17] [Applause]
[1:14:21] You take it away in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:14:24] [Music]
[1:14:26] Anybody else?
[1:14:28] [Music]
[1:14:31] We believe it.
[1:14:34] That's the
[1:14:36] the same Lord Jesus.
[1:14:42] When brother Renom made that statement,
[1:14:44] he said, "God is not complete without
[1:14:46] you."
[1:14:48] I said, "I want to keep that one."
[1:14:52] Not that all of them ain't real good.
[1:14:55] It's just some of them are a little more
[1:14:56] valuable, I guess you'd call it,
[1:15:00] because I believe it.
[1:15:04] But see church, we don't have to depend
[1:15:06] upon what somebody else says.
[1:15:10] We depend upon what God says.
[1:15:13] And God will use others to speak to us.
[1:15:15] He has. Thank God that he has given us a
[1:15:19] message.
[1:15:23] Thank God that we have it, that we can
[1:15:26] read and study and follow the message.
[1:15:34] Oh, how wonderful.
[1:15:38] All of the things. Father, we just ask
[1:15:41] you to go with us now as we go our
[1:15:42] separate ways and just give each one of
[1:15:45] us understanding of you. Lord, forgive
[1:15:47] our sins and just let your light shine.
[1:15:50] If we said anything that was contrary,
[1:15:52] we just ask you to forgive us and cover
[1:15:55] us. But to know for one thing for sure,
[1:15:57] Lord, and you know we've always believed
[1:15:59] you.
[1:16:01] We've always put it that we're waiting
[1:16:03] upon you. But your prophet said, "Now
[1:16:06] you're waiting on us. So help us.
[1:16:10] It's not for us to step out and to do
[1:16:12] great things. We don't have to. We just
[1:16:15] have to stand on what you believe and
[1:16:17] what you tell us and you'll make it
[1:16:20] manifest. We love you and we thank you
[1:16:23] in Jesus' name. Amen. You just missed
[1:16:26] remember the service.
[1:16:29] Glory,
[1:16:31] glory, hallelujah.
[1:16:37] Oh, blessed
[1:16:39] be his holy name.
[1:16:45] For he's
[1:16:48] the great emanipator.
