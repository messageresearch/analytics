[11:13] ourselves in all these things into your

[11:18] am Jeremiah 18 verse1 says the word
[11:22] which came to Jeremiah from the Lord
[11:25] saying arise and go down to The Potter's
[11:27] House and there I will cause thee to
[11:29] hear my words then I went down to The
[11:32] Potter's House and behold he wrought a
[11:34] work on the wheels and the vessel that
[11:37] he made of clay was marred in the hand
[11:38] of the Potter so he made it again
[11:41] another vessel as seemed good to the
[11:44] Potter to make it then the word of the
[11:47] Lord came to me saying oh House of
[11:49] Israel cannot can I not cannot I do with
[11:53] you as this Potter sayith the Lord
[11:55] behold as the clay is in The Potter's
[11:58] hand so are ye in my hand oh House of
[12:01] Israel at what instant I shall speak
[12:04] concerning a nation and concerning a
[12:06] kingdom to pluck up and to pull down and
[12:08] to destroy it if that Nation against
[12:11] whom I have pronounced turned from their
[12:13] evil I will repent of the evil which I
[12:17] thought to do unto them and at what
[12:20] instant I shall speak concerning a
[12:22] nation and concerning a kingdom to build
[12:25] and to plant it if it do evil in my
[12:28] sight that it obey not my voice then I
[12:30] will repent of the good wherewith I said
[12:33] I would benefit them now therefore go to
[12:36] speak to the men of Judah and to the
[12:39] inhabitants of Jerusalem saying thus
[12:41] sayith the Lord behold I frame evil
[12:43] against you and devise a device against
[12:46] you return ye now every everyone from
[12:49] his evil way and make your ways and your
[12:52] doings
[12:54] good in verse 12 says and they said
[12:57] there is no hope
[12:59] but we will walk after our own devices
[13:02] and we will everyone do the
[13:06] imagination of his evil heart amen God
[13:09] bless you may be seated
[13:11] tonight and
[13:13] uh just want to look at a a few things
[13:17] tonight
[13:19] and you know here in the in the
[13:22] scripture you know when when God tells
[13:25] Jeremiah to go to The Potter's House and
[13:27] he sees the work that was the Potter was
[13:30] working on the on the wheel was working
[13:32] on the clay and you know then he he
[13:36] turns to Jeremiah and he begins to speak
[13:39] and he was wanting them to to speak and
[13:41] he said go tell the you know the house
[13:43] of Israel that these are the things that
[13:46] I can do for you I can bless you or I
[13:49] can curse you but it's all about what
[13:52] you decide that was going to take place
[13:54] from this but you know he may he give
[13:57] them the opportunity give them the
[13:59] choice to make that they had the
[14:00] opportunity what was going to take place
[14:02] but God wanted them to know that he was
[14:04] there to bless them or to curse them
[14:07] because it laid before them whatever
[14:08] they decided that they were going to do
[14:10] that's what was going to take place but
[14:12] it's so amazing how he he sit there and
[14:15] he told him what was going to take place
[14:17] and you know you see so many times
[14:19] because in the book of Jeremiah we know
[14:21] that Jeremiah was the prophet that God
[14:23] came to and he began to talk to how the
[14:26] how the children of Israel had Israel
[14:28] had gotten away from God and you know he
[14:29] sent Jeremiah and Jeremiah keeps
[14:31] bringing coming back to the people to
[14:33] bring them back into the fellowship with
[14:35] God and bringing them back to the word
[14:37] and showing them where they're at and
[14:38] the condition that they're in and he
[14:40] keeps trying to bring them back to the
[14:41] same place and he keeps going back to
[14:43] them and keep bringing them back to this
[14:45] place and trying to show them that God
[14:48] had had something for them God wanted to
[14:51] bring them to a certain place but they
[14:53] did not want to and so many times is the
[14:56] grace of God that he kept going back
[14:58] back to him and and speaking to him
[15:00] because even here what is so amazing is
[15:03] as he brings this to the prophet and he
[15:06] tells him about all this but after he
[15:09] begins to tell them all these things and
[15:11] and you look through the book of
[15:12] Jeremiah how many times that God speaks
[15:14] to Jeremiah to go speak to the house of
[15:17] Israel and tell them the condition that
[15:18] they're in and what lays before them and
[15:21] then in the midst of all that in verse
[15:23] 12 they say there is no
[15:27] hope well it's the the grace of God that
[15:29] he kept coming back to you and pointing
[15:31] you back and telling you that you've
[15:33] left the you've left the word and I'm
[15:35] coming bringing you right back to the
[15:37] point and pointing you back to where you
[15:38] need to be and I'm it's well there
[15:41] there's no hope but we're just going to
[15:42] walk our own
[15:44] way why
[15:47] because many times when people get stuck
[15:49] in a situation they don't see the the
[15:53] full aspect they don't see the whole the
[15:55] whole picture they don't see the big
[15:57] picture of things and and you you begin
[15:59] to see how this thing lays
[16:02] out you know because here's Jeremiah and
[16:05] he and he sees this work that's being
[16:07] done on the wheel and as he begins to
[16:10] take this this uh whe this clay and he
[16:13] begins to work it and you know one of
[16:16] the things that people have a have an
[16:17] issue with and and you see that even in
[16:20] today's society the way things are
[16:22] people get to a place where you know
[16:25] they get stuck in in a situation they
[16:27] get stuck in a rut because it's like
[16:29] well it's always been this way it's
[16:31] always going to be this way and they
[16:32] don't see how things are ever going to
[16:35] change you know it's just like when when
[16:37] you look at the children of Israel when
[16:39] they were down in bondage and they spent
[16:41] 400 years in the land in bondage in
[16:44] Egypt and you see the condition they had
[16:46] a generation after generation living in
[16:49] bondage and all they had all they had
[16:52] ever seen because the because the ones
[16:55] that that had seen Joseph the ones that
[16:57] had seen the black blessings of God had
[16:59] seen the Miracles of God had seen all
[17:01] these things take place they were
[17:02] already gone but the only ones that ever
[17:05] saw that they that they talked about was
[17:08] what God done years ago but the only
[17:10] ones that they'd ever seen was the same
[17:12] people that lived the same life that
[17:14] they lived they still lived the same one
[17:16] why because they still lived under
[17:18] bondage they still still were beat and
[17:21] killed by the Egyptians they still had
[17:22] to go through the same ruts every single
[17:25] year and there was somebody that stood
[17:27] out there and told them that God was a
[17:29] good God God was a deliverer there was
[17:31] we are the children of Our Father
[17:33] Abraham and God made a promise to
[17:36] Abraham but there was a group of people
[17:38] that all they saw was the exact same
[17:40] thing every day was the same they fought
[17:43] the same battles they went through the
[17:45] same mud pits they went through all of
[17:47] the same thing they never saw anything
[17:49] different but there was somebody that
[17:51] kept telling them there is a a
[17:53] Deliverance to come there is there is a
[17:56] word that's been given to you but they
[17:57] did not see that and and that's the the
[18:01] reason why I want to talk about the word
[18:03] endure tonight because the problem was
[18:05] they didn't know how to hold on to what
[18:08] was given to them not to look at around
[18:10] what was around them but to hold on to
[18:12] the
[18:13] promise but you know what there was a
[18:15] group there was somebody that took took
[18:18] a hold of the word and did not look at
[18:19] what was around them because you know
[18:22] there was amram and Joseph B when they
[18:24] they was something about the word that
[18:27] laid upon their to pray for a
[18:30] deliverer why because when it came time
[18:33] for deliverance there was somebody that
[18:35] held on to the word and began to cry for
[18:38] that and then they began to pray that
[18:41] God would bring a
[18:43] deliver but then God used them to bring
[18:47] one and that and so you see how but
[18:50] people there's so many so many
[18:51] generations they were stuck in that same
[18:54] rut they didn't go beyond
[18:56] that why because they didn't see the
[18:59] long the long range Vision they didn't
[19:01] see the
[19:03] picture they just saw the mud
[19:06] pits they just saw the
[19:11] whips they just saw the death and the
[19:16] destruction but they didn't see the the
[19:22] promise and so here when we speak of
[19:24] Jeremiah speaking to the children of
[19:26] Israel see they had that same mentality
[19:29] all they see all they see is the same
[19:31] problems all they see is the same
[19:36] condition but what was but what was God
[19:38] showing
[19:41] Jeremiah Jeremiah was showing him this
[19:43] this clay I'm putting this Clay on the
[19:46] wheel and watch the work on the master
[19:49] look at the potter's wheel
[19:51] turning what was it it was the the clay
[19:54] lays there and it and it just goes
[19:57] around and around and around but what
[19:59] was it it's in the hand of the master
[20:01] it's in the hand of the
[20:03] Potter and so as it's going through this
[20:06] all it has to do is
[20:08] endure all it has to do is stay there on
[20:11] the wheel and as it turns and turns and
[20:13] turns well it doesn't see anything it
[20:16] nothing changes all it sees is the same
[20:19] mess but it doesn't see that it's in the
[20:22] hands of the Potter he doesn't say that
[20:24] it's in the hands of the Creator it
[20:27] doesn't see that it's exactly where God
[20:29] wants it to be it misses the place where
[20:32] it's
[20:34] at and what do we miss we've got just
[20:37] just to
[20:39] endure that's what we got to do is
[20:41] endure just like the the clay just stays
[20:45] there all the way through the scripture
[20:48] we find so many people they miss God but
[20:50] all God wants you to do is be right
[20:52] where he wants you to
[20:55] be
[20:56] see the word word endure means to
[20:59] continue in the same state it's saying
[21:02] it means to remain firm under suffering
[21:05] or Misfortune without
[21:08] yielding it means to undergo especially
[21:10] without giving
[21:12] in it means to regard with acceptance or
[21:17] tolerance see you stand just continue in
[21:20] the same state that you're
[21:22] in because if God's brought you to a
[21:26] place and you're praying so Lord I don't
[21:29] know why I'm I'm
[21:31] here well then if God brought you to a
[21:34] place then you know what God will lead
[21:36] you
[21:37] on well then you stay right where God
[21:40] laid you where God's placed
[21:43] you because you know as as the children
[21:46] of Israel he give them the cloud by day
[21:48] and the pillar of Fire by night he led
[21:50] them they had a sign to move that's
[21:54] right well you know what you have a sign
[21:56] to move also by the word
[21:58] the word will tell you what to
[22:01] do the word has G been given to
[22:04] us so stay in the place that he placed
[22:07] you remain
[22:11] firm well I I'm here but I don't know if
[22:13] I should
[22:16] go I well I I don't know be firm be be
[22:21] settled on what God's called you to to
[22:23] the place God's called you to be settled
[22:25] there so you're there
[22:29] and what do you so when God brings you
[22:31] to a place and you set someplace you're
[22:34] here he like well I don't know why
[22:36] things happen the way they do and you
[22:38] and you see the conditions that you're
[22:40] in but you know what just stay there be
[22:43] settled and
[22:44] endure to
[22:47] undergo the things that God wants you to
[22:49] go
[22:50] through so you're going through these
[22:53] things and it says to accept or to to
[22:59] tolerate so God's called you to this
[23:01] place so you stay here and you you go
[23:03] through the you endure these
[23:06] things now we don't always understand
[23:08] why things happen the way they do but we
[23:10] have a promise in the scripture that all
[23:13] things work together for the good to
[23:15] them that love the Lord who are the
[23:17] called according to his purpose so we
[23:20] know that there is a way that God brings
[23:22] us
[23:24] about that God wants us here that's
[23:27] right
[23:28] so when when you're when the clay is on
[23:30] the on the
[23:32] wheel that's the reason that the the
[23:34] scripture says you know the Potter can't
[23:36] say to the the clay can't say to the
[23:37] Potter why'd you make me this
[23:41] way because we because we're questioning
[23:44] God we don't even see the big
[23:47] picture we don't see what's taking
[23:50] place now he has so here's Jeremiah
[23:53] looking at the potter working upon the
[23:55] the the wheel the clay on the wheel and
[23:59] it says that as as the clay is laying in
[24:02] the hands of the Potter and it's
[24:05] turning and he does what he see what he
[24:07] thinks is good for the
[24:09] clay but in the midst of this the
[24:12] scripture tells us that the clay is
[24:15] marred in the hands of the
[24:17] Potter as it's sitting on this clay we
[24:20] see that it says then it's
[24:22] marred well when you go back and you
[24:24] begin to look at this there's two
[24:26] there's two different thoughts that come
[24:28] up from
[24:30] this number one we see that one time
[24:33] when you see that the when the Potter is
[24:35] working the
[24:37] clay there is something in the clay that
[24:40] shouldn't be
[24:42] there so there is a
[24:46] blemish or or something that that is
[24:49] uncooperative something that shouldn't
[24:51] be
[24:53] there and so he has to work it to get
[24:56] that out
[24:59] right and so there's something there
[25:02] that is that as as the clay is being
[25:04] worked there's something that lays there
[25:06] that only The Potter Knows is there and
[25:09] by the working of the Potter it comes to
[25:15] manifestation and when it becomes when
[25:17] it works out and it becomes to into the
[25:19] manifestation they realiz oh we got to
[25:21] get that
[25:23] out and
[25:25] sometimes which something that's that's
[25:27] always been there it's always laid
[25:29] there as brother bisc said you know we
[25:32] give that human grab
[25:36] bag there's a lot of things that we
[25:37] inherited that we don't
[25:40] like but you know what there's things in
[25:42] our lives that that you know we didn't
[25:44] we didn't have no control over it just
[25:46] ended
[25:48] up and you can't do nothing about it you
[25:52] can't you can't add one cubic to your
[25:54] stature you can't add any more hair well
[25:57] you you can you you go to Bosley spend a
[25:59] lot of money but you can't add any more
[26:01] hair to your
[26:04] head I mean there are artificial ways of
[26:06] doing
[26:07] things but you can't add any more hair
[26:11] you can't do these
[26:14] things now you can go to the store and
[26:16] you can buy some products and you can
[26:19] change your hair color
[26:22] back but you got to keep doing
[26:26] that there ain't there ain't no way that
[26:29] you're going to have some way that you
[26:31] that you can just wash it all out and it
[26:33] never comes
[26:37] back why because there's so many things
[26:39] why because that you inherited these
[26:42] things it's part of the human
[26:47] condition you know there's so many times
[26:49] in our lives you know because we we all
[26:51] have our different personalities and
[26:53] different things and you know there's
[26:55] things I I wish I could change it I
[26:56] can't change
[27:00] there's things and you know and you pray
[27:02] and pray and pray and you know what you
[27:05] wake up the next morning and you look at
[27:06] yourself in the
[27:08] mirror and you're still going back
[27:10] through the same
[27:12] thing how me you know because you know
[27:14] sometimes you get up and you say
[27:15] something and you're just like and it's
[27:18] like why did you say that why in the
[27:20] world did you say that and like and you
[27:25] and then you know what you you go a week
[27:27] a month whatever and you say it
[27:33] again and it's like well if you can't
[27:35] nothing good to say don't say nothing at
[27:36] all and you know
[27:39] what but I got an
[27:43] opinion it's like fire shut up in my
[27:47] bones I got to let it
[27:51] out and then sometimes when we let it
[27:53] out then it's like Lord forgive me
[27:57] that's right amen and we got to go pro
[27:59] go tell somebody I'm sorry if I offended
[28:00] you by what I
[28:06] said why because it's just human it's
[28:09] human nature it's who we
[28:11] are how many time how many times and
[28:13] some people are like man you know
[28:15] because they're just quick on the
[28:16] trigger there and other people they sit
[28:18] around like man I wish I was like that I
[28:21] wish I could just say things when I
[28:23] think
[28:25] them and it's like well some times you
[28:27] wish you were you you were wish you were
[28:30] you'd be glad you are like
[28:32] that cuz other people you know they just
[28:34] so quick to just fire it off and then
[28:38] and it's
[28:40] like but you know some people like boy
[28:43] I'd love to give a peace of my mind but
[28:45] you know what when when I'm in that
[28:46] situation I don't think about it it's
[28:48] when I'm away from it and I'm driving
[28:49] down the road it's like boy if I was
[28:51] back there I'd tell them this and
[28:54] that well sometimes you know thank the
[28:57] Lord that the Lord didn't you know your
[29:00] the the clutch was engaged and your mind
[29:03] wasn't
[29:06] running you didn't have you don't have
[29:08] to apologize about
[29:11] that but you know we all go through
[29:14] those things we all face those
[29:16] situations and we wonder why why because
[29:18] it's part of our human nature We
[29:20] inherited these
[29:22] things but what is it it's something
[29:24] that's
[29:25] there but as we go through things in
[29:27] life it begins to bring those things
[29:31] out and as those things become come in
[29:34] the Forefront you know then the Lord
[29:35] begins to deal with us about those
[29:40] things there's many people that that's
[29:42] had issues with
[29:46] anger and you know because it's taking
[29:49] years for them to get to the place that
[29:51] they get over
[29:53] that there's things that
[29:56] happen that you know we we just inherit
[29:58] it it's the way it's the way things
[30:00] are and the other the other set other
[30:04] school of thought that when you begin to
[30:06] look at this is things happen to you
[30:10] that you don't have any control over
[30:12] that you'll go
[30:15] through because the Potter does
[30:18] something to the clay and all of a
[30:20] sudden this
[30:23] happens and then all of a sudden well
[30:26] you know everything was going so
[30:28] good you know everything everything was
[30:31] smooth sailing I just everything looked
[30:33] so good I don't and all of a sudden you
[30:36] know I don't know what
[30:39] happened but you you look at you look at
[30:41] the life of Job here's job and and and
[30:45] God is speaking to the devil and tells
[30:47] him have you considered my servant job
[30:49] there's none like him and all of the
[30:56] earth well you know because you got a
[30:58] hedge around
[31:01] him let me mess with him for a while let
[31:04] my let me get my hands on him I want
[31:06] I'll show
[31:08] you but you know here here's
[31:12] job he wanted to be right before God he
[31:16] had he had the right attitude he had the
[31:18] right
[31:20] mentality he wanted to serve God with
[31:22] all his
[31:23] heart but you know what God allowed
[31:26] things to come in Jo life that he didn't
[31:27] have any control over but you know the
[31:30] scripture says that job never charged
[31:32] God foolishly for what he went
[31:35] through when he went through all with
[31:37] all the destruction and losing his
[31:39] family and everything everything is gone
[31:41] then then job's up there saying the Lord
[31:44] gives and the Lord takes away there was
[31:46] something that was added into the clay
[31:48] that he had no control over but when he
[31:51] went through
[31:52] that he didn't worry about it when
[31:56] everybody come to him and and said what
[31:57] have you done
[31:59] job we know that you're a secret
[32:02] sinner what have you
[32:05] done you know now we're now we're going
[32:07] to start combing through your life with
[32:09] a fine tooth comb find out what your
[32:11] problem
[32:14] is but you know he was right in his
[32:16] heart because he like well I don't know
[32:17] of anything and he began to speak to but
[32:20] the Lord went brought him through
[32:23] that to bring him to the place just like
[32:27] the Potter when he went through all of
[32:29] these things then he took the the clay
[32:32] and he was able to remod it into a
[32:37] vessel see has he as the the vessel is
[32:40] being the clay is being turned see
[32:43] there's something that takes place in
[32:45] the
[32:46] Potter in the clay that he begins to
[32:49] work
[32:50] it the clay doesn't have any control
[32:52] over it doesn't
[32:54] understand but the Potter does the the
[32:57] Potter knows what he's
[32:59] doing as as the clay is being turned the
[33:02] Potter begins to make manifest what's in
[33:05] his mind it becomes to be
[33:08] manifest see there's there's why because
[33:11] when people wonder why when when they go
[33:13] through experiences and different things
[33:15] that happen you know they they wonder
[33:17] why why why are all these things
[33:19] happening to
[33:20] me why because it's and when when you go
[33:23] through certain things it's hard to find
[33:25] the good in it right
[33:28] especially when the devil
[33:30] Center I got a package for
[33:38] you what here you
[33:41] go worry self-doubt all the other
[33:47] things here's a special
[33:49] book look at all the good things we got
[33:52] for
[33:54] you bud why because it's hard to walk by
[33:59] faith it's it's hard it's it's easy to
[34:01] walk by faith when everything's going
[34:05] good when you can't hardly take a step
[34:08] it's hard to walk by faith
[34:11] then feels like you're going one step
[34:13] forward and two steps
[34:15] back but those experiences and what
[34:18] makes you it's what brings you to the
[34:22] place see and when the when the Potter
[34:25] is working the clay see it takes while
[34:27] you have to
[34:29] endure you know because there is no
[34:32] Quick Fix In
[34:35] God there you won't find a getrich quick
[34:40] scheme brother John will be expounding
[34:43] on that more and more as as he's went
[34:45] and done a fine job up till now we've
[34:47] really been blessed by that but you know
[34:49] what it takes
[34:50] time it t it takes you have to go
[34:53] through this and it and it's
[34:55] hard yeah you know because it's easy to
[34:59] fall in a
[35:01] hole right but it takes a lot of work
[35:03] and sometimes it takes a little strategy
[35:06] to get out of
[35:09] it but many times people will fall in a
[35:11] hole and they'll sit there and it's like
[35:13] what I I don't I don't know what I'm
[35:14] going to
[35:17] do well when you hit rock bottom there's
[35:20] there's an old saying when you hit rock
[35:21] bottom there's only two ways to go
[35:22] straight up and
[35:25] sideways but you know what you start
[35:27] making a you start making a
[35:30] plan it's like there's a fell fell in
[35:33] and he could he figure out well you know
[35:34] what I can't go up but you know what he
[35:36] figured out he' go
[35:38] sideways he began to
[35:41] dig and the dirt that he was digging out
[35:45] was going underneath his
[35:47] feet and he kept
[35:50] digging and he kept putting more dirt
[35:52] under his feet and he kept digging and
[35:55] more dirt was under his feet well he
[35:57] wasn't going straight up but he was
[35:58] going
[36:01] out and it took him a it took him a
[36:03] while but you know what he figured out
[36:04] he could get
[36:06] out but he just didn't sit there and
[36:08] like what what am I going to
[36:12] do well you know I might as well just
[36:15] sit here and
[36:17] die or I'm just going to sit here and
[36:19] wait for somebody to come by and help me
[36:23] out and sometimes that's what God wants
[36:26] to see you know there's something that
[36:27] you can
[36:31] do so well because I
[36:36] have you know there there's so many
[36:38] things that that people go through in
[36:40] life
[36:41] and you know you you try to help
[36:45] people
[36:49] and you know you you you see there's so
[36:53] many things that that have happened to
[36:55] people and
[36:57] I was I was thinking the other day when
[36:59] I was looking at this and I had a friend
[37:02] of mine is he's a good
[37:04] friend
[37:06] and he used to go to
[37:11] church
[37:14] and you know you you want to help
[37:18] people but you know you've got to have
[37:20] an experience for
[37:23] yourself and the one thing you you've
[37:26] got you got to want to
[37:29] change you've got you've got to have the
[37:32] desire to go
[37:34] forward you it's got to be within
[37:40] you he was he was a a a a very very nice
[37:45] guy I I I loved him I love
[37:48] him but you know he went to church just
[37:52] a denominational Christian he just he's
[37:54] just a real good guy
[37:58] they had two children they lost they
[37:59] lost the youngest one the child was born
[38:03] with health
[38:05] defects unbeknownst to them it end up
[38:08] having problems and it was taken more
[38:11] rapidly than they expected it
[38:14] to he never
[38:17] come he never come to grips with
[38:21] that he knew in the back of his mind his
[38:24] son wouldn't grow up
[38:27] but when he went faster than he was able
[38:30] to prepare himself
[38:32] for when the child
[38:36] passed he was just stuck in a
[38:41] rut he couldn't he couldn't go beyond
[38:43] that that's where he was at in
[38:47] life now he liked to cut up and laugh
[38:50] and everything but there was a wound
[38:52] inside of
[38:53] him that he couldn't get past
[38:58] and I talked to him numerous times but
[39:00] you know that was one day I was I was
[39:02] talking to him and you know we we talk
[39:04] about different things
[39:07] but one day the Holy Spirit came
[39:10] down and I began to speak to
[39:14] him and I told
[39:17] him I said your problem is you're still
[39:19] mad at
[39:21] God you're still mad at God because he
[39:24] took your son
[39:29] but I said God's here to heal
[39:34] you see that's part of the human
[39:37] condition life and death we don't have
[39:39] any control over
[39:42] that but you know we go through these
[39:44] things and we don't understand God's
[39:47] plan but I told him I said listen you
[39:50] got to get
[39:53] ready I said you're still mad at God you
[39:56] can't move beyond that but God wants to
[39:58] heal you of that he wants to deliver you
[40:01] of that and I told him I said listen
[40:04] David said when when he had a child that
[40:06] was dying because of his own
[40:10] sin and he laid out there before
[40:14] God over that
[40:16] child and he laid out there all those
[40:19] days and he pleaded with God over that
[40:22] child and that child
[40:25] died
[40:27] but you know what David didn't lay out
[40:29] there on the ground any longer he didn't
[40:32] wallow in his in his tears any
[40:35] longer but when when he found out that
[40:38] the child was dead because he was there
[40:41] and he saw the servants talking and he
[40:43] said as the child passed and they they
[40:45] said yeah but then he said he got up and
[40:47] he washed himself and he anointed
[40:49] himself and he went and
[40:52] ate he went back to living Y and they
[40:56] said David why is it that now now you're
[40:58] out living life when you're not pleading
[41:01] for God he said why because while that
[41:03] child was alive he said I could plead
[41:05] for God and maybe he'd do something but
[41:08] he said now this child has passed on and
[41:10] he said I can't do anything about
[41:12] it he said the child has gone from me
[41:16] but David said the one thing that I can
[41:18] do is prepare myself to go where that
[41:20] child is and I told him said said you've
[41:24] got to do the same thing let me tell you
[41:27] something there's a day that you're
[41:28] going to have to give an account for God
[41:30] you can hold on to this thing and it's
[41:31] going to eat you up but there is a holy
[41:34] spirit here the spirit of the Lord is
[41:36] here to deliver you from that and bring
[41:38] you to a place that you can overcome
[41:40] that because you've got to get ready to
[41:42] go where that child is if you want to
[41:43] see your child
[41:47] [Applause]
[41:49] again that's what God wants us to do
[41:52] realize when we go through the hardest
[41:54] the hardest times in our lives and we
[41:56] Face these hard things there's a there's
[41:58] a plan that God has a plan for us there
[42:01] is a purpose behind
[42:03] that you know when when brother brandham
[42:05] was standing there and he and he was
[42:07] talking about losing hope and and
[42:09] sharing Rose and he was standing there
[42:10] and he said Lord you sheared me once he
[42:12] said Shear me
[42:14] again why because he didn't he didn't
[42:16] find the joy in all of that but he saw
[42:18] the goodness of God in that he saw the
[42:21] purpose in that there was something that
[42:23] was doing something for him there was
[42:26] that was to for him
[42:28] amen so you we go through these things
[42:31] we don't understand why these things
[42:33] happen but there's a plan and a purpose
[42:36] behind these
[42:40] things so we see all the the things that
[42:44] happen in
[42:46] life you know we we we want
[42:50] to go through certain things and we want
[42:53] to bypass certain things in life but you
[42:56] know there's no bypass in them you're
[42:58] going to have to go through these
[43:00] things you're going to have to go
[43:02] through the you're going to have to
[43:03] endure these
[43:05] things you know I I I was thinking of of
[43:08] brother baman when he was telling the
[43:09] story of the of the couples that he
[43:13] married you know he Mar he married this
[43:15] couple that you know they they had
[43:17] everything in the world that they could
[43:19] ever want both of their dads were
[43:22] multi-millionaires that had everything
[43:23] in the world anything everything was on
[43:25] a silver platter had everything you
[43:27] could think
[43:29] of but what was it they weren't
[43:32] happy they were out fussing and fighting
[43:34] and
[43:36] arguing and you know it's so amazing
[43:38] because even if brother brandham didn't
[43:40] you know he said well I walked up there
[43:41] and I I saw they were off there arguing
[43:44] they
[43:45] like and they told Brother oh yes we're
[43:47] we're very
[43:50] happy he's like well even if brother
[43:52] brandham didn't hear you fussing and
[43:53] arguing you know brother bram's a
[43:54] prophet you know he's got discernment so
[43:56] you know he he knew what y'all were
[43:59] doing before he got there it wasn't like
[44:00] like y'all even if he never heard
[44:02] nothing it wasn't like he didn't know
[44:03] what was going
[44:05] on but here they here they are going oh
[44:07] yes we're we're very happy no they're
[44:10] not got everything in and in in the
[44:12] world you can think of everything
[44:15] everything materially they were
[44:17] blessed but you know what they are both
[44:20] both of them jealous of each other got
[44:23] got their own little issues Petty things
[44:27] yeah and he said he went down there and
[44:30] had that little boy that didn't have two
[44:31] nickel to rub together had that little
[44:34] girl I think she was barefooted they
[44:35] come down there wanted to get married
[44:37] didn't have
[44:39] anything here they are and then and and
[44:42] nothing in this world but
[44:45] love and here they are they they get and
[44:48] they come down there brother Bri talks
[44:49] to them and said you know what are you
[44:50] going to do well I'm I'm going to do the
[44:51] very best that I can sir going to work
[44:53] and make her a living and it's like well
[44:55] you know if he loses his job and
[44:56] everything goes south what are you going
[44:58] to do young lady I'm going to stay right
[44:59] with him I'm not going back to
[45:01] Mama I'm going to endure
[45:05] this brother brand said he went down
[45:07] there by the river they living in a rail
[45:09] car ain't got
[45:12] nothing go down there but you know what
[45:14] she's sitting in his lap and they're
[45:16] they're in
[45:17] love they why because you know they
[45:20] they're working
[45:21] together you know he wants to do things
[45:23] for her and she's like well honey I
[45:24] don't need these things
[45:26] yeah but I want to do something for
[45:29] you why because they're on the same
[45:33] page realizing that they're trying to
[45:35] work together they're trying to make a
[45:37] life together they're trying to face the
[45:40] same
[45:41] things but you we see we see in today's
[45:44] world how everything is is you
[45:47] know you know everything is always
[45:50] backwards and upside down way people are
[45:52] now and you know it's like you know they
[45:55] come out there
[45:56] the these girls were talking and and it
[45:58] was on Tik Tok or something other and
[46:01] they were standing there like you know
[46:02] I'm looking for somebody that's 6 foot
[46:03] tall makes six figures and all this and
[46:06] it says well what do you bring to this
[46:08] uh relationship what do you I'm bringing
[46:16] me he's like so you're you're looking
[46:18] for a fine looking six six foot tall man
[46:21] to make six figures and you think he's
[46:23] going to take
[46:24] you
[46:28] he needs a woman like that like he needs
[46:30] another hole in his
[46:33] head well y'all can laugh not say Amen
[46:36] if you want to it's the
[46:39] truth but that's but that's the
[46:41] condition that the world's
[46:45] in what because there there's there's no
[46:47] working
[46:49] together when you know because you see
[46:52] people today they they get and you know
[46:54] it's like well I you know I won't I
[46:55] wanton the moon I want this I want that
[46:57] like listen you're going to get married
[47:00] and you ain't going to have
[47:04] nothing unless you win the lottery or
[47:06] something you know I mean because
[47:07] everybody thinks well you know what well
[47:09] mom and daddy lives a certain way and
[47:10] they have a certain well you know what
[47:12] your Mom and Daddy has has slaved and
[47:14] worked and labored for 40 years to get
[47:20] there but nobody sees where your Mom and
[47:23] Daddy had to do
[47:24] without yeah come on when they when they
[47:28] when they've had to go when they've had
[47:29] to swallow their pride sometimes to go
[47:31] through things to make
[47:34] it but you got kid but you got people
[47:37] today and they wonder why why why the
[47:39] the marriage rate is the way it is and
[47:41] the divorce TR is the way it is today
[47:43] why because there is there is no working
[47:46] together there is no getting on the same
[47:50] page well I tell you the first thing
[47:53] that a lot of problems is that they have
[47:55] today is number one is they're not
[48:00] Christians because you know what they
[48:01] want to run everything do everything
[48:03] without God we don't have to have God in
[48:04] none of it you wonder why it falls
[48:08] apart but they wonder why but it's the
[48:10] same thing that because they don't want
[48:11] to put any time into it they don't want
[48:13] to put any effort into
[48:16] it because you know they say well you
[48:18] know it's all about having
[48:20] 5050 no it's
[48:24] 100% because you know what if you don't
[48:26] give 100% And your spouse don't give
[48:29] 100% then you know what it ain't going
[48:31] to
[48:32] work it takes it take why because
[48:35] there's lots of times it
[48:37] takes a great big sea of
[48:40] forgetfulness it it takes a lot of
[48:45] forgiveness why because there comes a
[48:48] time you've got to put the things in the
[48:49] past in the past and not live back
[48:53] there amen but you know what the problem
[48:57] is is we let the devil run around with
[48:58] the great big mirror and hey look see
[49:00] behind you you see
[49:06] that we're not looking in the as brother
[49:08] Lise said we're looking in the mirror of
[49:10] the
[49:12] word if we look in the mirror at the
[49:15] word if we're looking in the word and we
[49:17] see ourselves in the
[49:19] word and then we begin to change
[49:22] that Lord let me change what what I see
[49:25] in the word that I become more like the
[49:31] word because you know there's you
[49:34] because some girl's going to marry some
[49:35] guy it's like well you know I'm going to
[49:36] change
[49:41] him good luck with
[49:45] that what do they say women want to
[49:49] marry some guy that she can change and
[49:50] some guy wants to marry a girl that
[49:52] hoping she never
[49:54] changes
[50:02] why because because they have but they
[50:04] have their own way about
[50:06] things and they and they fail to realize
[50:09] but you know what it takes it takes a
[50:13] work we'll be praying we'll be praying
[50:16] have a prayer line after after this
[50:17] service
[50:19] [Laughter]
[50:23] today there's a bomb in Gilead
[50:27] but it t but it takes work working
[50:31] together because people well you know
[50:33] you know because you know you you read
[50:35] all these fairy tales and and all of
[50:37] these love stories and everything like
[50:39] that here's the love story that you read
[50:42] get into the
[50:46] scripture and see you know what there's
[50:48] going to be hardships there's going to
[50:49] be things that the battles and the
[50:51] stresses and the struggles are going to
[50:53] be
[50:54] there
[50:55] and you can think well I think I think I
[50:57] can handle it I think I can handle it
[50:59] well sometimes you start getting into
[51:00] problems and things and struggles in
[51:02] your marriage and things happen in life
[51:04] in family life and you're like oh
[51:08] lord it's like I wasn't expecting
[51:13] this but that's what God wants you to
[51:16] do see you got to come through these
[51:19] things but you've got to
[51:22] endure but God wants you to realize that
[51:25] you are equipped to handle this God has
[51:28] brought you to the he wants you to
[51:30] understand these
[51:31] things that's right see we understand
[51:34] that when you have a a
[51:36] family you get married and you're going
[51:39] to have children and you know
[51:41] what husband
[51:44] wife sometimes everything you're
[51:46] different as as daylight and
[51:49] dark and you know because some oh
[51:51] everything's so wonderful everything's
[51:54] just one comes
[51:57] together and then it's it's to like two
[51:59] opposing
[52:01] magnets you
[52:05] just you can't get together on
[52:10] nothing but that's part of the that's
[52:12] part of the enduring that's part of the
[52:16] growing and
[52:20] then Richard Richard where's Richard at
[52:24] Richard always tells I'm I'm going to
[52:25] say this Richard always says when I get
[52:27] up here I always preach on
[52:29] him but I told him I said well if you
[52:31] was a preacher you get up here and
[52:32] preach on
[52:35] me but I get to tell the stories how I
[52:38] want to tell them there you
[52:43] go there's Richard's version and and
[52:46] there's the truth
[52:49] so cuz I don't remember a lot of things
[52:52] he says that
[52:54] happened but but my memory is a lot
[52:56] better than his you just you can test us
[52:58] on
[53:00] that but you know you go through things
[53:02] and I always tell Richard I was like
[53:05] just remember you're going to have to
[53:07] pay for your raisin you're going to pay
[53:09] for your
[53:11] raisin and he and he
[53:13] has God bless God blessed him with a
[53:19] son and uh I love Thomas to death but
[53:23] they Richard tells me things about
[53:25] Thomas and I was like sounds familiar

[54:29] and dad said I had one that looked like
[54:31] me and I had one that acted like
[54:34] me and I'll let y'all try to figure that
[54:37] that one
[54:41] out but you know you you see these
[54:44] things and all of a sudden it's

[56:15] you've got a struggle it's a it's a job
[56:19] you've got to you've got to put and work
[56:21] through that you've got to be the
[56:24] standard for the
[56:27] family what you know because brother R
[56:30] was talking about the in the age in
[56:32] which we live all the wealth and all of
[56:35] all the Wonder the fineries that we have
[56:37] in this
[56:38] world and you know now they they have
[56:40] this thing where you know they they want

[56:53] tablet and we won't
[56:57] you know we want YouTube and Elon Musk
[56:59] or whoever else out there you know you
[57:01] know they're going they're going to
[57:02] teach you going teach your
[57:06] kids and you wonder why kids end up with
[57:09] the thoughts and
[57:11] ideas why because the world is set
[57:16] up because it's all satan inspired and
[57:20] it starts as soon as they get a
[57:22] conscious
[57:23] thought it's through that that those
[57:26] seeds are being swn into your
[57:29] children and if you don't teach your
[57:32] children they're going to end up with a
[57:33] whole bunch of garbage sewed into
[57:36] them that's the reason why you see all
[57:39] these kids they they they've never
[57:40] darken the door of a
[57:44] church they they they don't they know
[57:46] more
[57:47] about Pokemon and all kinds other then

[59:38] condition that the world is in and you
[59:40] know that they they they want to have
[59:41] this little
[59:45] bit and he says and he was talking about
[59:48] the he said about the Ed he said but
[59:50] they expect this little time spent by
[59:53] the children in the educ ational plant
[59:55] to take the place of the hours of
[59:58] training supposed to be given in the
[1:00:02] home because there's there's no because
[1:00:05] there's no Mom there's no
[1:00:09] dad years ago I heard a guy and he was
[1:00:12] talking about H raising kids and he said
[1:00:15] he said the people that are raising kids
[1:00:16] nowadays is Axel Rose and
[1:00:22] mad and from y'all from from the 80s
[1:00:25] would know who that is right that's from
[1:00:28] our
[1:00:32] generation I guess I guess nowadays I I
[1:00:35] say it's Taylor Swift or whoever
[1:00:38] else but they think that's but but but
[1:00:40] you know what but brother R said it
[1:00:42] takes hours of training at
[1:00:47] home and you know what and and I'm I'm
[1:00:49] the first one to say you know I'm short
[1:00:51] on
[1:00:53] that
[1:00:55] I'm
[1:00:59] lacking because you know it's it's not
[1:01:01] it's not just talking about it it's
[1:01:03] actually taking the time when you're so
[1:01:05] busy and everything else and the world
[1:01:07] just spinning all around you it's like
[1:01:10] hey we got to put brakes on this we got
[1:01:12] to stop this we got to slow this down
[1:01:15] and we got to make time for
[1:01:18] it you got to take time to pray with
[1:01:21] your kids talk to them about
[1:01:23] things
[1:01:27] right you know the the times that we've
[1:01:29] we've done the uh the quizzes The
[1:01:31] Listening to brother benham's messages
[1:01:34] you know sometimes we've had problems
[1:01:36] trying to get through the trying to get
[1:01:37] through the
[1:01:38] sermon we began to listen to them the
[1:01:40] next thing you know there comes a
[1:01:42] discussion and we try to get through
[1:01:44] it's like well let let's let's try
[1:01:46] no then all of a sudden we you know
[1:01:48] because we're answering
[1:01:51] questions because one of the boys I have
[1:01:53] one question and what about about this
[1:01:54] and what about that and all a sudden
[1:01:56] it's like okay well you know we're not
[1:01:57] going to finish the tape today because
[1:01:58] you know what we're going to answer
[1:02:00] questions but it's good that they have
[1:02:03] questions that something that Peaks
[1:02:04] their
[1:02:06] interest it's nice when they come and
[1:02:08] ask you questions about
[1:02:11] things because you know it's like you
[1:02:14] know you want to teach them and you want
[1:02:16] to try to tell them what's right and try
[1:02:19] to help them amen I got I got two boys
[1:02:23] and I it's like you know the one thing I
[1:02:25] know real good is air
[1:02:27] conditioning and you know I Levi Levi
[1:02:30] can do
[1:02:31] it he does don't well now I think he's
[1:02:34] now he's getting paid now since he's got
[1:02:36] a job I think he's he's more into it now
[1:02:39] but but you know you try to teach them
[1:02:42] something and you know all of a sudden
[1:02:43] you just see their eyes glaze
[1:02:48] over it's like the lights are on but
[1:02:50] nobody's
[1:02:53] home
[1:02:56] but you know you're trying to you're
[1:02:58] trying to but you know what if they
[1:03:00] don't you all you gotta do is put it in
[1:03:01] front of
[1:03:03] them you can't you can't force it but
[1:03:05] you know if you just lay it before
[1:03:08] them and then you
[1:03:10] know and then if they if they decide
[1:03:13] they going to take it then they'll take
[1:03:14] it but you you just lay it before them
[1:03:18] and let them let
[1:03:20] them see if they're going if they want
[1:03:22] to do anything with it or not amen
[1:03:26] and it's like you know I I I like to you
[1:03:29] know in my job you know i' I've you know
[1:03:32] new people have come in you just put
[1:03:35] something in front of them and see if
[1:03:37] they can fix it or not or make it mess
[1:03:38] it up or figure out anything and I've
[1:03:42] had the boys do the same thing here and
[1:03:45] they just I mean they they they look at
[1:03:47] you know like like they old saying about
[1:03:49] a calf looking at a new gate they just
[1:03:51] stare at it like but you know what I
[1:03:53] mean at times they' done they've done
[1:03:55] real well I've been really proud of them
[1:03:57] really really impressed but you know it
[1:04:00] you just got to put it in front of
[1:04:03] them and you say sometimes you go
[1:04:05] through and you're talking to them and
[1:04:07] and you think they're just in church and
[1:04:09] you know they're they're dozing or
[1:04:10] whatever they're doing this or that but
[1:04:12] sometimes you know what they're
[1:04:15] listening you think they're
[1:04:19] not but occasionally you know I I've had
[1:04:21] the boys and all of a sudden they they
[1:04:22] come by and all of a sudden they begin
[1:04:24] to talk about
[1:04:25] things all a sudden they bring things
[1:04:27] back it's like wow you were
[1:04:32] listening you know I always told
[1:04:34] everybody ad Adams Adam was always my
[1:04:38] preacher Adam Adam's always been my
[1:04:40] preacher because you know there's been
[1:04:42] times over the years I'd preach
[1:04:43] something and Adam he next thing you
[1:04:45] know he's out he's out sharing it with
[1:04:50] everybody I preached a message one time
[1:04:52] about being clothed in his right and not
[1:04:54] being found
[1:04:57] naked Adam he started going around to
[1:04:59] everybody said do you know that we're
[1:05:00] all naked in the sight of
[1:05:06] God did you know that that if you're not
[1:05:09] clothed in his righteousness you're
[1:05:13] naked and it was like you know what
[1:05:16] that's an amazing way of bringing that
[1:05:18] out and people are like what kind of
[1:05:20] church you go
[1:05:23] to exactly but you know what it brings
[1:05:26] them to a realization that they're not
[1:05:28] where they need to
[1:05:29] be if you're not if you're not in him if
[1:05:32] you're not clothed in his righteousness
[1:05:34] then you are you will be found
[1:05:37] naked wretched miserable blind and naked
[1:05:41] and brother R said you don't know
[1:05:44] it what a condition to be
[1:05:48] in but you see the condition that the
[1:05:51] world is in see we go through all these
[1:05:53] things and we have to face all of these
[1:05:55] hard problems and and
[1:05:58] testing and we don't want to go through
[1:06:00] these things but God has a plan for
[1:06:03] us you
[1:06:05] know I was thinking of brother R when he
[1:06:07] was talking about you know six second
[1:06:09] Smith you know brother Bram want to be a
[1:06:12] boxer he's like you know I'm going to be
[1:06:14] a well 6 second Smith told brother
[1:06:17] brandom he said Bill if you going to be
[1:06:18] a you going to be a boxer you know you
[1:06:22] just need to get ready
[1:06:25] and he about knocked he about knocked
[1:06:26] brother brandom out of the ring and and
[1:06:27] he was like uh why you trying to do this
[1:06:30] you know you trying to kill me he's like
[1:06:33] no I'm getting you ready he said when a
[1:06:36] man gets fit it stops his heart you got
[1:06:38] to prepare you got the only way the only
[1:06:40] way that you're going to be able to
[1:06:41] handle this is go through this
[1:06:45] experience get back in the ring and get
[1:06:48] just about get knocked out of it and get
[1:06:49] back in the
[1:06:50] ring but what was that he fought 15
[1:06:53] fights yeah and never lost to one of
[1:06:56] them why he went through an
[1:07:00] experience now I'm sure I'm sure that he
[1:07:03] was out there
[1:07:04] like boy I like that one give me some
[1:07:11] more yeah I'll take another one of
[1:07:15] them but you know what he endured
[1:07:18] that because he could
[1:07:20] see and especially the first time he got
[1:07:23] in the ring and got hit really
[1:07:26] hard and it took his
[1:07:29] breath and then all of a sudden it's
[1:07:32] muscle
[1:07:33] memory it's your training takes
[1:07:37] over why because he'd been through that
[1:07:39] he endured that he knew what to he knew
[1:07:41] what to expect he knew how to handle it
[1:07:44] and all of a sudden when it went through
[1:07:45] that like you that I can that I can
[1:07:47] react I can
[1:07:49] recover because if not he'd have got hi
[1:07:51] and just laid there
[1:07:55] why because it it takes you have to go
[1:07:57] through
[1:07:58] things you know there was a there was a
[1:08:00] man that was a he was a Marine in in uh
[1:08:05] Vietnam and he was talking about the
[1:08:07] lieutenants that they had over there and
[1:08:09] the in the platoon and everything like
[1:08:11] that and they said you know some some
[1:08:13] lieutenants when they when they LED
[1:08:14] their their companies or their or or
[1:08:16] squads I believe it's companies that
[1:08:17] they have when they would let them
[1:08:19] through there and he's like you know
[1:08:20] they had they had some of them were hard
[1:08:22] and rigid and tough on
[1:08:25] them he said they go through a certain
[1:08:27] time change your socks they go through
[1:08:29] this you do this you go through that you
[1:08:31] go through and he said some of them they
[1:08:34] would not I like well listen if you want
[1:08:35] to change your socks go
[1:08:38] ahead what happens if you don't change
[1:08:41] your
[1:08:42] socks you end up what they call trench
[1:08:44] foot you get infection in your feat and
[1:08:48] next thing you know you can't
[1:08:50] walk and you know what if you got half
[1:08:52] your men and you're in the middle of the
[1:08:53] jungle somewhere and you got the enemy
[1:08:55] coming at you and half of them can't run
[1:08:57] or
[1:08:58] walk you're all sitting
[1:09:02] ducks but you know what he done that
[1:09:04] because he was like well you know what
[1:09:06] the they they just want to be their
[1:09:07] buddies they just want to take they just
[1:09:08] want to be their
[1:09:10] friends you know what if you're not hard
[1:09:13] because there was a reason why they were
[1:09:15] that
[1:09:16] way because not only did it did it
[1:09:20] affect those men it affected him
[1:09:25] can you imagine going out there and
[1:09:27] those men not being equipped to do the
[1:09:29] job that they were called to do and
[1:09:30] you're leading them and you're the
[1:09:32] reason why they're not equipped to do
[1:09:34] the job and they're out there and you're
[1:09:35] seeing those dead those men's bodies
[1:09:38] laying on the ground and you're the sole
[1:09:40] reason why they're
[1:09:45] there why because you want well you I
[1:09:47] just want to take it easy on
[1:09:50] them no that didn't that didn't help
[1:09:52] them at all that's right
[1:09:55] and it's the same way with while
[1:09:57] while when we have a
[1:10:01] Ministry well when when the when the
[1:10:03] ministers get up there and they begin to
[1:10:04] say things and and and get on our cases
[1:10:07] about
[1:10:11] things like are we going to hear this
[1:10:15] again well you know what if You' get
[1:10:17] past it if you do what you told you it
[1:10:19] would be a
[1:10:21] problem but you know it's if keeps
[1:10:24] coming up there's probably a reason
[1:10:27] why like brother talking about that man
[1:10:29] preaching to they said well brother
[1:10:31] we're enjoying these sermons where we
[1:10:32] keep hearing you preach on the same
[1:10:33] thing about repentance he said well when
[1:10:35] everybody repents I'll move on to
[1:10:36] something
[1:10:39] else but we're going through this why
[1:10:42] because you've got to endure these
[1:10:43] things what brother say that that the
[1:10:46] trial he said he said that's what God
[1:10:48] gives the
[1:10:49] church he said it's he said he gives you
[1:10:52] trial after trial test after test trial
[1:10:55] after trial he said until the Life of
[1:10:58] Christ is reflected in your life am he
[1:11:01] said until you become Peaceable peaceful
[1:11:04] sober Meek gentle humble ready
[1:11:07] submissive willing turn your head from
[1:11:10] the things of the world and looking
[1:11:12] straight to Calvary to the one who's
[1:11:14] doing the
[1:11:17] beating amen when you go through all
[1:11:19] these things when he brings you through
[1:11:22] all that
[1:11:24] we don't see we don't always see what
[1:11:26] God wants us to see but you know what
[1:11:28] he's there and he's
[1:11:31] working and he's molding it into His
[1:11:34] Image what he wants it to go
[1:11:38] through you see all the ones you know
[1:11:40] there's there's Paul what a great man
[1:11:44] here's Paul going you know all all the
[1:11:46] things Fise of the Pharisees all the you
[1:11:49] know all all the checks all the boxes of
[1:11:52] his pedigree right all the things that
[1:11:54] he had been through man look at
[1:11:56] me I counted all this
[1:11:58] dung right
[1:12:00] brother I've been through there had all
[1:12:03] of this training I knew the word back
[1:12:06] forwards
[1:12:08] everything but you said you know it
[1:12:09] didn't count me didn't do me one bit of
[1:12:11] good I don't count it as one
[1:12:14] thing but you know he brother BR said he
[1:12:17] had to go three and a half years on in
[1:12:19] the back side of the desert in Arabia
[1:12:21] there take three and a half
[1:12:24] years God took the word that he
[1:12:28] held and he began to open it up and it
[1:12:31] began to show him the scriptures and he
[1:12:34] began to see all these
[1:12:37] things all the all those years of him
[1:12:39] studying and all this and all of a
[1:12:41] sudden the Lord began to open up and
[1:12:43] began to see all these
[1:12:46] things what an amazing thing that then
[1:12:48] all of a sudden here's Paul and he said
[1:12:50] you know he said I'd be counted a curse
[1:12:52] for my breth and S if they could see
[1:12:56] this that you know this this is for this
[1:13:00] is what I want them to
[1:13:02] see that that we are the
[1:13:06] ones that God has blinded their
[1:13:09] eyes that we the Gentiles may
[1:13:15] see those those that are considered
[1:13:19] uncircumcised the circumcision and not
[1:13:22] realizing that we are the
[1:13:25] circumcised God blinded their eyes that
[1:13:27] we might be brought in that we can see
[1:13:30] these
[1:13:32] things I counted all as dung that I
[1:13:34] might win
[1:13:36] Christ that all the things that I
[1:13:39] suffered you think of of of Paul's all
[1:13:42] the things that he went through all the
[1:13:43] things that he suffered all the things
[1:13:44] he had to go
[1:13:46] through he said you know count it all
[1:13:48] joy when you go through all these things
[1:13:51] amen it's a it's a joy
[1:13:55] yes you
[1:13:57] endure but we live in you know we live
[1:13:59] in a in a world now that you know people
[1:14:02] people don't understand how to endure
[1:14:04] don't understand
[1:14:05] it you know the scripture talks about uh
[1:14:09] in in the last days in uh in Mark he
[1:14:14] talks about you know when when the word
[1:14:16] being
[1:14:17] sown and the and the word being sown
[1:14:20] Jesus telling about the the parable of
[1:14:23] the SE and he said this the word was
[1:14:25] being sown and he said it fell on Stony
[1:14:28] ground there and he said all of a sudden
[1:14:29] you know they rejoiced and and they were
[1:14:31] they were happy for a while they endured
[1:14:33] for a
[1:14:34] while here they are but he said he said
[1:14:36] then all of a sudden they they it's it's
[1:14:39] it's a it's a um what's the word it's a
[1:14:42] catchphrase today it's a buzz word they
[1:14:45] were
[1:14:48] offended they were
[1:14:51] offended and they dried up
[1:14:55] up why instead of
[1:14:58] enduring all of a sudden they they
[1:15:00] become
[1:15:02] offended and not realizing what God was
[1:15:06] doing and was was a was a scripture tell
[1:15:09] us that in and and U later on uh Jesus
[1:15:14] was speaking there and he was talking
[1:15:16] about how um you know false Christ would
[1:15:21] arise and he said he said because those
[1:15:23] are offended he said they'll turn
[1:15:25] against each other in the last
[1:15:29] days why because there's not there's not
[1:15:32] those that are going to
[1:15:34] endure why because they're going to be
[1:15:37] offended but he said but he said he that
[1:15:40] endureth shall be saved he that endures
[1:15:43] to the end shall be saved there's a
[1:15:46] group that's going to endure to the
[1:15:49] end see God has us on the Wheel amen and
[1:15:54] we're being in the hands of the
[1:15:58] Potter that he is molding us into His
[1:16:01] Image he's making us into His Image amen
[1:16:05] amen have the musicians come this
[1:16:08] evening but that's what God wants us to
[1:16:10] do he wants us to be in his
[1:16:13] hands we see the we see the let's all
[1:16:15] stand with the condition that the world
[1:16:17] is

[1:16:41] of the of the clay is able to mold
[1:16:45] it and just in
[1:16:49] endure the scripture says my son despise
[1:16:53] not the chastening of the Lord when you
[1:16:56] go through the and but you know if you
[1:16:58] endure that's what God wants you to do
