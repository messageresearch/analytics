[15:10] the Lord if you'd like to turn in your
[15:11] scriptures turn where back where we've
[15:13] been
[15:14] reading Romans 8
[15:18] 28-31 then we'll go to 2 Corinthians
[15:22] 11:3 and then 1 Corinthians
[15:26] 15:22 remember thaten remember the Lord
[15:29] willing next Sunday brother Claude
[15:32] wisinger will be here for the weekend
[15:34] and just pray for him that the Lord
[15:36] would would bless him and and be with
[15:39] him and uh remember uh the fellowship
[15:42] meeting will be the third Saturday at
[15:46] brother uh Tony is there at Six Flags so
[15:51] if anybody wants to go and everything
[15:53] you know remember that it be there um
[15:57] and also as far as right now because of
[15:59] his problems he had with not being able
[16:02] to come brother for you know his mother
[16:03] passed away but the Lord willing he will
[16:06] be with us the last Sunday of this month
[16:09] which I think is the
[16:11] 24th but he will be with us probably on
[16:14] the Wednesday just dropping in and we'll
[16:17] be hunting for a few days and and then
[16:20] you know be here for the weekend so
[16:22] remember that uh all
[16:26] right we've thank the Lord that brother
[16:29] Al passed his stress test
[16:35] amen he passed his stress test and so
[16:38] that was good and there's a sister I
[16:40] forgot to mention this morning there's a
[16:42] sister up at Brother Richard Wilson's
[16:45] that needs a special prayer uh a touch
[16:48] from the Lord and you remember brother
[16:50] Hall that used to be there brother
[16:52] Richards um he has had a lot of manyi
[16:56] strokes and he lost a a lot of his
[16:59] memory so just remember that uh to pray
[17:02] for him because most of you remember
[17:04] brother Hall and everything and the Lord
[17:06] willing next Sunday brother Terrence
[17:09] mentioned that brother Serano he's doing
[17:11] better but he still got a long road to
[17:14] go you know about his heart and heart
[17:16] attacks and things that he's had uh they
[17:18] can't give him one thing because of the
[17:20] other backward and forth uh they have no
[17:23] insurance so the next Sunday the Lord
[17:25] willing we will just pass a special
[17:27] plate you know for brother Serano to uh
[17:31] send to him you know to try to help him
[17:33] along a little and also remember that
[17:35] next Sunday all right any other
[17:37] announcements I generally
[17:39] Miss again we say thank you to everybody
[17:41] for the uh time that we had yesterday at
[17:44] the uh down at the uh railroad tracks
[17:49] and all the kids are playing and that's
[17:51] having a good time and and all like that
[17:53] we really appreciate you coming and
[17:55] being there is real good turnout and we
[17:58] had a good time we didn't
[18:00] uh we didn't get to announce either a uh
[18:05] what we were going to talk about on the
[18:07] next uh Bible study which would be
[18:12] December the first Saturday in December
[18:15] but uh it's been mentioned a couple of
[18:17] times that maybe to some of you that I
[18:19] need to go over a little bit uh like
[18:23] your seven Church ages but eight
[18:26] manifestations of God EX Etc and things
[18:29] like that so we don't have anything
[18:31] announced so we'll try to do that you
[18:34] know there on that one to see you know
[18:36] and that way you can fit it together how
[18:38] the messenger comes at the End of the
[18:40] Age and and what those things means and
[18:44] and it would help I believe to
[18:46] understand a lot of things because
[18:48] remember brother R said I'm not the
[18:49] messenger to lady oia that's right right
[18:52] he said don't do that said you make me a
[18:54] Lady of sin right see he's a messenger
[18:58] to the bride right so we got to know and
[19:00] understand how everything fits together
[19:02] or we'll have it running wrong on what
[19:04] we're trying to study but just remember
[19:06] that okay Romans 8 2 Corinthians 11 1
[19:11] Corinthians 15 Heavenly Father we thank
[19:13] you for your love and your grace unto
[19:15] each and every one of us we thank you
[19:17] for Calvary thank you for loving us
[19:20] because if you hadn't loved us where
[19:21] would we be even the best that we could
[19:24] do in all of life of everything would
[19:26] not be sufficient in any form to stand
[19:29] before a living God but yet you made a
[19:31] way and you asked us to come boldly so
[19:33] we come boldly before your throne and
[19:36] asking you to bless each and every one
[19:38] remember Brother Dean there Lord is
[19:39] speaking down to his brothers remember
[19:40] Wade there for brother Burley and just
[19:43] be with them probably all on the way
[19:45] home now take care of them give them a
[19:47] safe journey we just ask you to guide
[19:49] each one and keep us we love you and we
[19:53] thank you Father but more than anything
[19:55] in the world we want you to cleanse us
[19:57] and guide us forgive our sins because
[19:59] that's what we desire in Jesus name amen
[20:04] Romans
[20:09] 8 for we know that all things work
[20:12] together for good to them that love God
[20:13] to them who are the called according to
[20:15] his purpose for whom he did for know he
[20:18] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[20:21] the image of his son that he might be
[20:23] the firstborn among many
[20:25] Brethren more over whom he did
[20:27] predestinate them he also called and
[20:30] whom he called them he also Justified
[20:32] and whom he justified them he also
[20:34] glorified what shall we then say to
[20:37] these things if God be for us who can be
[20:40] against us amen so let's go
[20:43] to now to 2 Corinthians we've used this
[20:47] but just kind of putting together a few
[20:50] little things and bringing it over in
[20:52] the message if you have any questions we
[20:55] will have questions and answers um maybe
[20:58] next Sunday I'm not certain it's just
[21:01] how far we're going and what we're going
[21:03] to try to to get through and and do but
[21:06] write down your questions your thoughts
[21:08] your comments and we'll be glad to try
[21:10] to cover these things
[21:13] okay 2 Corinthians 11:3 but I fear lest
[21:18] by any means as the serpent begal Eve
[21:20] through his subtility so your mind
[21:22] should be corrupted from the
[21:24] Simplicity that is in Christ all right 1
[21:28] Corinthians
[21:30] 15
[21:34] 22 for as in Adam all
[21:38] die so as in Christ shall all be made
[21:42] alive amen you may be seated it I hope
[21:44] we're getting a good thought on the uh
[21:48] two
[21:49] trees and understanding the tree of life
[21:52] being Christ the tree of knowledge of
[21:55] Good and Evil being Satan and coming
[21:57] down to giving us an
[22:00] understanding of uh you know where we're
[22:04] at now what I've been trying to do in
[22:06] these past few
[22:08] Services uh the reason we kind of you
[22:11] know we came down through uh studying on
[22:16] uh predestination and how God
[22:18] predestines by for knowledge not by
[22:22] desire and coming down to uh getting to
[22:26] the garden and seeing what's taking
[22:28] place and I hope you're you're seeing
[22:30] these and I start picking up a little
[22:32] bit on brother brandom said that God had
[22:35] a predestinated
[22:37] plan and it was necessary that these
[22:42] things take place to fulfill his
[22:45] plan remember he predestinated by for
[22:49] knowledge so his plan would have to be
[22:51] covered in for knowledge so we came we
[22:55] went through the for knowledge and
[22:57] selling the things we went up into Glory
[22:59] spent a few Services preaching of what
[23:01] was in heaven and then Dro back down to
[23:04] earth now to pick up and look
[23:07] at the forn knowledge of God and looking
[23:11] at it and seeing uh you know what is
[23:15] taking place upon Earth and knowing that
[23:18] God would know all of those things there
[23:21] would be nothing pulled over on him but
[23:23] knowing that if he gave us a choice we
[23:27] would follow
[23:29] and see it would be be something for you
[23:32] and I to say boy if I'd have been back
[23:35] there you know have you ever noticed
[23:37] people to say that you remember they
[23:39] said it to
[23:40] Jesus something paraphrasing it you know
[23:44] if we'd have been back dire they
[23:45] wouldn't have killed in Prophecy he said
[23:47] you polish the tombs of the guys that
[23:48] done the
[23:50] killing
[23:52] right see but we think oh I wouldn't
[23:55] have done it now I have been worse it's
[23:59] just the best way to do it cuz Adam and
[24:01] Eve started off real good we started off
[24:05] junk but that's just you know the life
[24:08] all right but now remember our Point
[24:11] here is what we're trying to do look at
[24:15] what happened back
[24:17] there and for the past few Services if
[24:19] you'll watch this you'll see what I've
[24:22] been doing we look back there to see
[24:25] what took place in the garden
[24:29] but then coming over and seeing what's
[24:32] taking place to you and
[24:35] I now that's been my kind of theme for
[24:39] the past few Services is not to look
[24:42] back at them you remember the prophet
[24:44] said that's what man will do he looks
[24:46] back he looks forward forgetting what's
[24:48] taking place all right so we need to
[24:50] look to what's going on in our hearts
[24:52] and our lives from that and as we do
[24:55] then we can can pick up in you know and
[24:58] see what's going on you know maybe the
[25:01] Lord willing another message or so we
[25:03] kind of click in to you to understand
[25:05] that because I want to talk about uh the
[25:08] seat of the woman getting into that
[25:11] but now this past Wednesday
[25:15] night I went
[25:17] through and trying to get us to look at
[25:20] something that to me has been very
[25:24] interesting and I've heard it scrambled
[25:26] over and preached on and everything else
[25:30] but you know we just take a few quotes
[25:33] and we quote oursel to death instead of
[25:36] taking the entire message and you
[25:38] remember our Wednesday night now just
[25:40] back up just to
[25:41] H
[25:43] that we were covering how brother
[25:45] brandham said in the
[25:47] breach that Adam fell from eternal life
[25:50] to death there in the garden and brought
[25:54] all
[25:55] mankind unto death
[25:58] well L some five or six months before
[26:01] then he was talking about how that God
[26:05] breathed into the nostrils of Adam and
[26:07] gave him eternal life especially into
[26:10] Adam well now did Adam fall from eternal
[26:14] life as we are thinking in our mind as
[26:17] to just quote
[26:20] something because how can you fall from
[26:23] eternal
[26:24] life where would you fall to if you fell
[26:28] from eternal life you would go to
[26:32] death right is that sensible I don't
[26:35] think there a gray area that we could
[26:37] fall from eternal life flop in the
[26:39] middle wait around a little while at
[26:40] while get back over and go the other way
[26:43] I I don't think that way I believe if
[26:46] you fell from eternal
[26:48] life as we think it then you would
[26:53] die and you'd be lost and you go to hell
[26:57] cuz you'd fall to death all but you
[27:00] remember what I was trying to bring out
[27:02] now Adam never received eternal life in
[27:08] his
[27:09] body he was put out of the garden said
[27:12] lest they partake of the tree of
[27:16] life and live forever so he didn't die
[27:20] from he didn't fall to death like
[27:25] lost but he fell from the situ situation
[27:28] that he could never attain unto eternal
[27:30] life in body cuz that's what you and I
[27:33] are
[27:34] doing you and I because of the fall and
[27:38] because of the way things are going and
[27:40] Satan penetrating our mind you and I
[27:43] right now are falling from eternal
[27:46] life my brother
[27:49] Dale it's right there before us it's the
[27:52] message this message is eternal life
[27:54] Jesus said my words are life
[27:58] and see we're falling to death why we're
[28:02] dying that's what happened to Adam he
[28:05] died physically speaking but he never
[28:09] lost eternal life cuz God's not an
[28:12] ending Giver well I think I don't care
[28:14] what you think I'm sorry I done preach
[28:17] too long and I don't I this church never
[28:20] got to the size it is now me petting you
[28:22] and I don't intend to do it now I just
[28:25] intend to keep preaching if you don't
[28:27] believe what I believe that's up to you
[28:29] and I don't believe you can have eternal
[28:31] life and fall from it cuz that make God
[28:34] an ending Giver thatd make something but
[28:36] we can have eternal life in our soul and
[28:39] die and go by the grave and we're going
[28:42] to do that because I was trying to
[28:44] preach on death remember we're going to
[28:46] keep dying until
[28:48] somebody gets into the
[28:51] message andless the message get into
[28:53] them and walk on into the word of God
[28:57] we're going to keep dying because if you
[29:00] understand what I'm saying Adam never
[29:02] lost his eternal life he just never
[29:05] attained into eternal life In the Flesh
[29:08] that's to me is simple it's just like he
[29:10] would say on who is this meled we'll get
[29:12] back to it
[29:13] eventually he
[29:15] said we by P pass or
[29:20] theophany he's done covered in the
[29:21] message your soul is your theophany did
[29:24] we bypass our
[29:26] soul
[29:29] no we bypassed coming the way Jesus came
[29:33] all right was it a 285 Journey around
[29:36] Atlanta you know bypass around the city
[29:40] no we just never came that way is that
[29:44] simple I like things simple that I can
[29:47] understand with the ninth grade
[29:48] education I I have problems
[29:50] comprehending all of these great
[29:52] terminologies you know I like it
[29:55] simple so
[29:58] we didn't bypass at theop didn't come
[30:00] around it we just never came that
[30:03] way Adam never lost eternal life in his
[30:06] soul and become a lost being that way he
[30:10] lost eternal life In the
[30:13] Flesh and that throwed you and I to
[30:16] death amen and as I said and I'll say
[30:21] again as long as we keep pity pattering
[30:24] around playing little
[30:26] games
[30:27] you know we're going to still die and go
[30:30] by the
[30:32] grave I thank God he keep his promise
[30:35] you'll bring us
[30:36] out where do we get to that in the
[30:39] message if we get that far today all
[30:42] right but do you understand what I'm
[30:44] trying to get at yes the whole human
[30:47] race was thrown into
[30:49] sin
[30:50] by
[30:52] Adam as we
[30:54] read and saying that in Adam all
[30:58] die but you know what I love about the
[31:00] scriptures I I love it because God
[31:04] doesn't leave us
[31:06] dangling it's just like you know where
[31:08] we read there in second Corinthians
[31:10] About Eve that Satan through his
[31:13] subtility deceive us like he did Eve
[31:15] through the Simplicity that is in Christ
[31:17] Jesus it always goes to the good side
[31:21] all right in in 1 Corinthians 15:22 as
[31:24] in Adam all
[31:26] die
[31:27] but what is the rest so even so in
[31:31] Christ shall all be alive Made Alive
[31:34] it's always an
[31:36] upcoming you know a mother remember a
[31:38] brother very legalistic man and but he
[31:42] said you can preach people under the
[31:44] table you know beat on them real
[31:47] hard but he
[31:49] said always give them a little out at
[31:52] the end you know and I thought that's a
[31:55] good point all right
[31:57] now
[31:58] listen sickness sorrow heartaches
[32:01] troubles Etc came by the Fall that we
[32:05] were bringing out this morning as to
[32:07] seeing that you know Eve had an affair
[32:11] with the Beast we don't have to jump
[32:14] back over that too much uh it give us an
[32:17] opportunity to just run right through
[32:19] the scriptures you know and and bring it
[32:22] down because you don't want to leave
[32:23] company to where that they can't follow
[32:26] what you're doing
[32:27] and just hear you say some little
[32:29] something and don't explain it it's hard
[32:31] enough as it is to explain it to the
[32:34] best you can and then people
[32:36] misunderstand because of their teaching
[32:38] but I can't help
[32:40] that but I can help doing one thing I
[32:42] can look at the
[32:44] Bible and and I can let the Bible
[32:47] interpret itself unto me that I can see
[32:50] and understand the uh doings and that's
[32:54] what I'd like to do is we'll just start
[32:57] if we don't get through the message uh
[32:59] we'll get it
[33:00] Wednesday but we went through what
[33:05] happened in the garden we went through
[33:09] how even in me or other
[33:12] messages how that uh Adam wasn't cursed
[33:17] Eve wasn't cursed brother Rand said
[33:21] but the Beast the
[33:24] snake was you know the Beast was cursed
[33:27] made a snake the ground was
[33:29] cursed and all of the things and uh you
[33:33] know and even in
[33:36] uh Cain it says that the world was
[33:39] cursed on account of him in doing what
[33:41] he was doing and it brought him to a
[33:43] place of
[33:44] being in trouble with God all right and
[33:49] then it brought him to this situation
[33:51] that we want to take just a little bit
[33:53] today and think about just take the
[33:55] scripture we've been through it
[33:57] but I've got a little bit coming on down
[33:59] so uh listen very M very carefully so go
[34:03] ahead brother and let's pull up Genesis
[34:05] 4 we were in Genesis 3 let's pull up
[34:09] Genesis 4 and 1 and just think about
[34:12] what is
[34:14] said and I want you to listen very
[34:20] carefully uh Genesis
[34:24] 41 Adam knew his wife and she conceived
[34:27] and BARC and said I've gotten a man from
[34:30] the Lord now does that scripture bother
[34:39] you now what I mean by it
[34:43] is it looks
[34:46] like that it's saying
[34:50] that uh Cain was Adam's
[34:55] son
[35:01] right I mean you read
[35:03] it and Adam knew his wife and she
[35:06] conceived and bar
[35:09] came and said I've gotten a man from the
[35:15] Lord but when you come to a revelation
[35:17] of something then you
[35:19] see uh that even though we read
[35:25] words words are not not a revelation
[35:28] that's
[35:30] right a revelation comes because of
[35:32] words
[35:34] right but it's not
[35:36] always like brother R says the Bible
[35:39] says uh Judas went and hung himself and
[35:43] said you go do
[35:44] likewise he just gave you the
[35:47] scripture but he took one from here and
[35:49] one from
[35:50] here all right now I want you to and I'm
[35:54] not very good on English you know that
[35:57] anybody on the internet know that in a
[35:58] hurry uh I like what sister Julie said
[36:03] when they went up to Canada brother Boyd
[36:05] and him and they asked him where they
[36:07] were from and when they got through
[36:09] telling them where they were from they
[36:10] said we know you got to be an
[36:13] American because of the way you're
[36:16] talking you know I mean they' know we
[36:19] were
[36:20] Georgians by our words right but now
[36:24] think about
[36:25] it
[36:28] do you know that that's exactly
[36:31] right yes sir that scripture is
[36:33] identically perfectly
[36:38] right but it hid from the eyes of smart
[36:44] mankind the way God said it hid it from
[36:48] the eyes of the wise and prudent that's
[36:52] right but see it's according to how you
[36:54] read
[36:55] it
[36:58] right it's according to where you pause
[37:01] and what you
[37:02] emphasize
[37:06] right now think about
[37:09] it and Adam knew his wife he
[37:15] did Adam knew his wife he had a relation
[37:18] with his wife right
[37:22] right that's exactly
[37:25] right but then when you
[37:28] say then Cain is the son of Adam see now
[37:32] you're reading
[37:36] wrong so take this old ninth grade
[37:40] education and drop it for what you want
[37:43] to Adam knew his wife that's exactly
[37:48] right and she conceived and that's
[37:51] exactly
[37:55] right and barcan and that's exactly
[38:00] right and said I've gotten a man from
[38:02] the Lord and that's exactly
[38:05] right cuz all life comes from
[38:08] God so we read the scripture and we say
[38:10] it's right but now for me to read it and
[38:12] say but look there brother Dale and Adam
[38:14] knew his wife and she con and knew his
[38:17] wife and she conceived and by
[38:19] Cain the Bible says Cain's the son of
[38:25] Adam
[38:29] come
[38:32] on but we know about
[38:35] Revelation by the next verses and the
[38:38] different
[38:40] things and Cain was not the son of
[38:48] Adam so
[38:50] now we come back to simple
[38:53] logic so we read it this way and and
[38:56] Adam knew his wife and she
[39:00] conceived she did she brought
[39:06] Abel and
[39:10] barcan
[39:13] conjunction and
[39:16] barcan and she said I've gotten a man
[39:19] from the Lord cuz she never placed it
[39:21] brother R said saying that Adam was the
[39:24] father of King
[39:27] he said because all life comes from God
[39:31] right all right no matter how dirty the
[39:34] mom and daddy is or whatever it is no
[39:38] baby ever come from anybody but God he
[39:41] has to permit that person to be born all
[39:45] right now you can read the scriptures
[39:46] and it it should take away that little
[39:49] you know uh part in you that would say
[39:53] but but that surely doesn't look like
[39:57] that it's saying
[39:58] that Cain is the son of Adam but it's
[40:01] not it's according to where you're
[40:03] breaking your thought and what you're
[40:05] saying all right now because it goes to
[40:09] the next and she again bear his brother
[40:13] abble so there's two times
[40:16] of new you
[40:19] know and the one time of new is here and
[40:23] the other one is like chapter five
[40:26] where he
[40:28] knew Adam knew his wife Eve she bear a
[40:31] son called his name
[40:32] Seth see so there's only the one aair or
[40:37] one thing was between Adam and
[40:40] Eve but yet then there's one between Eve
[40:42] and the Beast and there you got your
[40:45] twins that we were talking about this
[40:47] morning all
[40:49] right and against you are his brother
[40:51] and Abel was a keeper of sheep the Cain
[40:53] was a tiller of the ground sister bar
[40:56] brought it to my
[40:57] attention that uh you know that Cain was
[41:02] a tiller of the
[41:03] ground but because of the Fall he became
[41:06] an Eater of
[41:08] meat that's it's a good
[41:11] thought he became Eater of meat CU he
[41:14] started
[41:15] hunting Cain was a great hunter see
[41:17] Nimrod and all of that coming forth so
[41:21] it started changing things because of
[41:22] the fall all right but now what
[41:28] what I want us to look at today is to
[41:30] look
[41:31] at uh we'll get to it later as the
[41:34] wicked
[41:36] one but I want us to look at the uh
[41:40] attributes as we spoke of you know how
[41:43] that sin is unbelief but then there's
[41:46] always attributes to be
[41:48] displayed the dranking gam and smoking
[41:51] Etc is an attribute a display of your
[41:54] unbelief so then there had to be
[41:56] something happened there was an unbelief
[41:59] right disbelief but then there was a
[42:02] display of
[42:04] that
[42:06] unbelief and we can see what happened in
[42:08] the human race and to look and see what
[42:11] the fall brought to
[42:13] pass you know upon the human race all
[42:18] right and just think about it a
[42:22] little and think about the things that
[42:24] took place
[42:29] all right verse three and then in the
[42:30] process of time it came to pass that
[42:32] Cain brought her the fruit of the ground
[42:35] and offering unto the Lord now we're
[42:36] reading a little bit that he was a very
[42:39] good religious man that he was a very a
[42:42] devout worker you
[42:44] know he worked himself to death building
[42:48] an altar raising the fruit or whatever
[42:51] you want to do or going out and
[42:52] Gathering or whatever can Abel's lay up
[42:54] under a tree with his hands back behind
[42:56] his head you know and he offers blood
[43:00] and oh my God what he what are you doing
[43:03] you're a
[43:06] murderer you
[43:08] know you you're You're a murderer you're
[43:12] mean
[43:13] God and to think that
[43:16] God made him quats of skin you
[43:21] know but Cain brought of the fruit of
[43:23] the ground an offering unto the Lord
[43:27] and Abel he also brought of the
[43:29] firstlings of his flock and of the fat
[43:32] thereof and the Lord had respect unto
[43:35] Abel and to his
[43:41] offering and brother brandham said I
[43:43] gave them to you we read them past
[43:45] Wednesday on paragraph
[43:48] 246 PR of transformation
[43:52] 1965 he said Cain
[43:54] knew the the perfect will of
[44:00] God but he refused to do
[44:03] it he said Can knew and it's that one
[44:06] and it's a power of transformation and
[44:09] it's that one and it's in the other one
[44:12] God's power to
[44:16] transform he said Can knew the perfect
[44:19] will of God but wouldn't do it he said
[44:22] Cain knew that God accepted Abel's
[44:25] message
[44:30] now bring that on down to this day we
[44:33] talk about a message coming in end
[44:37] time and we see a man get
[44:40] up and preach a
[44:43] message and we see
[44:46] him challenging the
[44:49] people to come
[44:52] up and to prove his message was right
[44:55] God comes down down heals the sick
[44:57] raises the
[44:59] dead discernment calling out
[45:04] Etc but he had 300 preachers
[45:08] remember that one time that he was
[45:11] talking to him about water
[45:13] baptism oh they all right there in front
[45:15] of him we want them tapes we want so
[45:17] many hundred of them he said not a one
[45:22] ever came back
[45:24] amen
[45:27] now we look back there and think about a
[45:29] horrible
[45:31] thing but I love the reason he used it
[45:33] in both of those quotes I'm and I'm sure
[45:36] he was referring to his
[45:38] message he said Cain knew the will of
[45:41] God he said can you that God accepted
[45:45] Abel's
[45:47] message well I never read in I were able
[45:50] had a
[45:54] message what was Able's message
[45:58] came we was born
[46:01] in Mama's blood from Daddy's
[46:05] blood there's blood in the
[46:09] garden
[46:11] right surely they discussed what they
[46:14] believe they were not just 10y old
[46:18] kids they were probably in their
[46:21] 20s and offering
[46:24] sacrifices
[46:30] what was Abel's
[46:31] message it was speaking of the blood of
[46:34] Jesus
[46:37] Christ Cain turned that
[46:41] down he had a great
[46:48] understanding he had a great
[46:52] intellectual uh
[46:54] understanding
[46:57] he could see in plain language that his
[47:01] sacrifice was
[47:02] rejected so that meant his message was
[47:06] rejected what was Cain's
[47:11] message that it was
[47:14] fruit right that they ate apples you
[47:19] know oranges pomegranates or
[47:23] something and God rejected Cain's
[47:26] message
[47:29] right but accepted
[47:32] Abels you youever read around and say
[47:34] that Abel had a
[47:38] revelation I agree with
[47:42] that but do we need to read these two
[47:45] quotes again for you to understand that
[47:47] Cain had a great
[47:54] knowledge can a had a great
[48:00] understanding of what Abel was talking
[48:05] about
[48:06] right because he knew the perfect will
[48:09] of God you said Brother D I i' sure let
[48:12] to love know the perfect will of God for
[48:13] my
[48:16] life you might be walking in
[48:20] it right in the middle of
[48:23] it but just think of about
[48:26] it he told him in that power of
[48:29] transformation what I said people in the
[48:31] message and say but brother Dale Cain
[48:34] couldn't be saved brother random said he
[48:35] could so that solves
[48:39] it in the message power of
[48:41] transformation paragraph 18 through 184
[48:44] brother ROM
[48:46] says God said do like your brother and
[48:49] I'll receive
[48:51] you let's see there's another one in
[48:54] here I'll get it to you in a
[48:57] minute he said God went
[49:01] after
[49:05] Cain but yet we get this great
[49:08] Revelation the serpent seed can't be
[49:15] saved you show me where and what's the
[49:20] difference in the body the body the body
[49:23] everybody got it the body of a born
[49:26] again believer and the body of a lost
[49:31] person what is the difference in it it's
[49:34] all body that's
[49:36] right and I wouldn't care if I run my
[49:40] DNA all the way back and found out I was
[49:43] a direct descendant from the
[49:48] Beast I shout Glory
[49:51] Hallelujah cuz my dependence is not in
[49:53] the flesh it's in the the god that's
[49:56] right the new birth yes sir Jesus never
[49:59] said to Nicodemus
[50:02] Nicodemus you got a possibility to be
[50:04] born again but these other people out
[50:05] here are serpent
[50:08] seed I got a quote where brother Brown
[50:10] said the serpent seed is so spread until
[50:13] there's only a small
[50:15] portion of the seed of the woman
[50:20] left he said it spread to the
[50:23] world right all
[50:26] right but think about it
[50:31] now what happened and
[50:34] why would verse
[50:37] six verse five and Cain is off Cain was
[50:41] very
[50:42] wro and his countenance fail and the
[50:45] Lord said unto Cain why art thou wroth
[50:47] and why is thy countenance
[50:51] Fallen
[50:53] now where did that come from
[50:58] now he's upset right countenance Fallen
[51:02] mad you know
[51:07] irritated and even his
[51:10] countenance you know what I mean you're
[51:13] supposed to
[51:15] be but then the other
[51:18] uh
[51:20] right even his countenance I'm preaching
[51:22] here a lot of time and I'm looking back
[51:23] at you and I wonder what in the world
[51:25] they
[51:26] thinking cuz it sure ain't showing up on
[51:28] the
[51:31] face I told him I said when you're
[51:33] scanning the things and and you don't
[51:35] know they're doing it they just scanned
[51:37] it while ago I was sitting back there
[51:38] watching you while you're
[51:42] singing be careful about you sleeping
[51:44] they can scan you and show everybody in
[51:46] the country what you're
[51:48] doing but I've caution them please don't
[51:50] zero in on somebody
[51:54] that's
[51:57] you try to find somebody's
[52:01] screening kind like Wade said you know
[52:03] what does these newcomers think when we
[52:06] don't even amen what the pastor's saying
[52:08] that's
[52:11] right and you ain't going to get no amen
[52:13] out no I ain't trying
[52:15] to CU if you're amening out of the fact
[52:17] of what was said about that you're a
[52:21] hypocrite is that plain
[52:24] enough I amen what I
[52:27] believe and I have amen a lot of things
[52:30] the preacher said and right in the
[52:31] middle of it he changed the thought and
[52:33] I got
[52:35] caught and had to say uhoh I don't agree
[52:38] with that life
[52:41] fart I amen what I believe so evidently
[52:45] most of you don't believe
[52:48] all why is your countenance
[52:51] falling
[52:54] okay
[52:56] why you Ro at
[52:57] me would you understand yes where did
[53:00] that come from that's all the question
[53:03] I'm
[53:05] asking where did all of that where did
[53:07] that come
[53:08] from it couldn't come from God that's
[53:13] right it doesn't talk about able being
[53:15] that
[53:22] way and we're going to read some things
[53:24] and just a second on the scripture so
[53:27] look what he said verse if thou doest
[53:29] well shalt thou not be done not be
[53:30] accepted and if thou doest not well sin
[53:33] lith at the door and unto thee shall be
[53:36] his desire sin and thou shalt rule over
[53:39] him you can rule over sin if you want to
[53:43] if you don't you can follow after it all
[53:46] right and the Lord said unto Cain where
[53:48] is Abel thy brother and he said I know
[53:50] not am My Brother's
[53:52] Keeper and he said what hast thou done
[53:55] the voice of thy brother's blood crith
[53:58] unto me from the ground what about a
[54:02] man am I My Brother's Keeper what why
[54:05] you getting on to me about
[54:08] it the man that killed
[54:10] him where would that come
[54:13] from the
[54:15] effects the
[54:17] attribute right
[54:20] right the attribute was Cain right amen
[54:25] Cain's attributes is showing what nature
[54:29] he is
[54:33] of brother R said what about a human
[54:35] being would stand in the presence of
[54:40] God and speak like
[54:46] that rebuking
[54:51] God devil ain't even that
[54:54] bad
[54:59] come
[55:00] on you just put a little bit of devil in
[55:02] a man and you got something worse than
[55:04] the
[55:08] devil
[55:10] right cu the devil don't have a physical
[55:13] Force to display his
[55:17] anger
[55:19] agree he can enter animals he can do
[55:21] things but he has no ability but the man
[55:25] has a physical
[55:27] force and he did he killed
[55:32] Abel now I was listening got one in the
[55:36] truck I listened to a lot about the
[55:37] church
[55:38] ages and brother BR said you might think
[55:41] that this is so so he said because I'm
[55:43] making it so
[55:45] hard he said but I want you to know that
[55:49] I'm not talking about just outlandishly
[55:51] mean not talking about this but just
[55:53] talk outlandishly wrong stuff that the
[55:56] churches are doing he said it's just
[55:58] that tiny little
[56:02] thing see remember they're going to
[56:04] church right over here this
[56:06] afternoon remember they're
[56:09] worshiping remember they're crying and
[56:11] praying to
[56:14] God right and you know God can come over
[56:17] there and bless people and heal
[56:20] people what come
[56:23] on so we think of Cain then after we do
[56:27] finally get to thought well Cain was
[56:28] just a mean old
[56:30] guy how mean was
[56:36] he number
[56:38] one it mentions him
[56:41] first making the
[56:44] offering he
[56:49] worshiped
[56:51] right come on he worshiped right
[56:55] he wanted to go to
[56:57] church go ahead with number two now
[56:59] let's get a few of
[57:01] these is said Abraham's Covenant
[57:03] confirmed
[57:04] 1961
[57:07] 318
[57:09] e51 so many today God you'll give your
[57:13] intellects to
[57:14] God what now so many today God you'll
[57:18] give your intellect see we'll give our
[57:20] intellects to God are you following
[57:23] him I'll build you a big house I'll make
[57:27] you an organization I'll do this I'll do
[57:30] that don't you realize that's the same
[57:33] thing Cain did amen it was
[57:38] rejected the only thing Cain's offering
[57:41] could in any way represent would be
[57:44] natural works of the
[57:48] flesh well brother you know works of the
[57:51] flesh is
[57:53] good if it's from a born again believer
[57:56] but if it's not what's it
[58:00] worth and we don't believe in
[58:02] works we believe in
[58:05] Fruit works of the flesh can get you in
[58:08] trouble fruits of the spirits what we
[58:11] need am I in the
[58:14] scripture don't you realize that's the
[58:16] same thing Cain did so bring it over
[58:18] here where we are today right here in
[58:20] Lula
[58:21] Georgia Cain built himself an altar
[58:25] made a sacrifice and said it here it is
[58:29] I worship you I believe
[58:33] you there's My
[58:37] Sacrifice there's my
[58:40] altar take it or leave
[58:46] it ain't that something you mean we
[58:49] could be doing that
[58:53] today
[58:55] that's the man
[58:58] today the religious
[59:02] man Esau the same
[59:06] way Esau was a great whole lot better
[59:08] guy than Jacob wasn't
[59:10] he working for his daddy and all kind of
[59:14] things and the church the same
[59:18] way I've done this I've done this I've
[59:21] done this it ain't what you done
[59:26] is what he's done give your heart give
[59:29] him your heart and follow him talking
[59:32] about Lula
[59:34] Georgia brother there what do you want
[59:37] I'm in church ever service I ain't like
[59:39] some of these others that lay
[59:42] out your cter it's
[59:47] Fallen you get
[59:51] it brother Dale I pay my tithe I go to
[59:54] church I believe the
[59:57] message what else do you
[1:00:03] want he says that's what Cain says said
[1:00:07] Cain was saying to God take it or leave
[1:00:09] it you know what God left it we'll give
[1:00:13] a few more quotes about
[1:00:14] that but I want you to just read the
[1:00:17] quotes of what he's talking about I told
[1:00:20] you I had one or two of these written in
[1:00:21] my Bible from years back because some
[1:00:24] people were arguing about Cain and the
[1:00:26] different things
[1:00:29] and but then I ran in and just ran in
[1:00:34] take it or leave it on the computer in
[1:00:36] the message you do that and you get
[1:00:39] home look what the next one
[1:00:41] says this is the mark of the beast and
[1:00:44] the Seal of God part two 1961
[1:00:48] 217
[1:00:52] E18 now we notice that Cain he he made
[1:00:54] an
[1:00:56] altar he put sacrifice on
[1:00:59] it he got down and confessed his faith
[1:01:03] in
[1:01:09] God what be doing away with some of that
[1:01:12] mean Old Devil you think Cain
[1:01:14] was and getting down to see and he was a
[1:01:16] human
[1:01:18] being one of these days I'm going to get
[1:01:20] around to preach on that brother Brown
[1:01:22] said every human being
[1:01:25] every human being is born with a desire
[1:01:29] to serve
[1:01:35] God oh but I didn't think everybody he
[1:01:38] said everybody was born with that faith
[1:01:41] in
[1:01:43] them no that's it
[1:01:47] well do what you want to he got down and
[1:01:51] confessed his faith in God and worshiped
[1:01:53] God
[1:01:56] in other words just like the religious
[1:01:58] man
[1:02:00] today 99 out of 100
[1:02:06] almost you to read
[1:02:08] that 99 out of a 100 almost they
[1:02:14] say 99 out of 100
[1:02:17] says here it is the best that I can
[1:02:22] do Cain said this I I I built an altar I
[1:02:26] belong here at the church made a
[1:02:28] sacrifice this is the best I can do take
[1:02:31] it or leave
[1:02:35] it there it is that's just the that's
[1:02:39] the attitude of people
[1:02:41] today he said
[1:02:44] 99 out of
[1:02:50] 100 I don't believe he meant
[1:02:53] that
[1:02:56] well talk to
[1:03:00] him if you seen him today he'd probably
[1:03:02] say
[1:03:05] 99.9
[1:03:07] right but look best I can do take it or
[1:03:11] leave it there it is that's just the
[1:03:12] attitude of people today I go to church
[1:03:15] I help them do everything we build a
[1:03:17] nice building we've done all this and
[1:03:19] we've done all that and everything I put
[1:03:22] into the Widow's fund
[1:03:24] and I do all this there it is the best
[1:03:27] that I can do take it or leave
[1:03:30] it but God will leave it he left it
[1:03:34] there for Cain he will leave it there
[1:03:37] for you there is a way that seeth right
[1:03:40] unto a
[1:03:44] man right but the end thereof is the way
[1:03:47] of death there's only one provided way
[1:03:50] for God
[1:03:51] that's down the bloodstream name to the
[1:03:54] Holy Spirit without that you're done
[1:03:58] you're
[1:03:59] finished you'll never go
[1:04:02] in look at the next one all the days of
[1:04:05] our life 1959 612
[1:04:10] e19 and he's so much like Cain Cain
[1:04:13] wanted to be
[1:04:15] religious he went and made his own
[1:04:17] religion and when he did he brought it
[1:04:19] before God with something like this
[1:04:21] here's the best I got this is all that I
[1:04:23] can do about it now take it to leave
[1:04:28] it that's about the way man does today I
[1:04:32] help build a church I sent my children
[1:04:33] to church I put my money in every year
[1:04:36] and that's the best I can do take it or
[1:04:38] leave it oh see he wants his own way
[1:04:43] that's the way Cain
[1:04:48] did but God still loved him right and
[1:04:51] went after him are you you're reading it
[1:04:55] what did God tell Cain you do well if
[1:04:58] you'll just worship like your brother
[1:05:02] Abel abble come God's way but Cain
[1:05:05] wanted his way and God says now Cain
[1:05:09] I've got nothing against
[1:05:11] you if you'll just come over and go the
[1:05:14] way that Abel goes you'll do
[1:05:21] well
[1:05:23] right now remember
[1:05:28] this as we get to the next scripture in
[1:05:30] a second remember what he's
[1:05:34] saying built the churches put in the
[1:05:37] money and the best made offerings made
[1:05:39] sacrifices they
[1:05:43] doing God even still loved
[1:05:46] him but he wants his own way that's
[1:05:52] right now and why would
[1:06:00] God if it wasn't something wrong why
[1:06:02] would God speak so much in the word
[1:06:04] about
[1:06:09] Cain and the way he spoke of it go ahead
[1:06:12] and pull up number five Jude 11 Brother
[1:06:15] Ray said I was giving Jude for John this
[1:06:17] morning John for Jude so you put it
[1:06:19] together and get it in the right
[1:06:22] place judeah
[1:06:24] 111 woe unto them for they have gone in
[1:06:28] the way of
[1:06:34] Cain and ran greedily after the heir of
[1:06:38] balum for reward we know that he got
[1:06:41] paid he got all these and perished in
[1:06:43] the gain say in a Kora you remember the
[1:06:45] gain say of aora we're all
[1:06:48] spiritual you take too much on yourself
[1:06:50] Moses we're spiritual also that's right
[1:06:55] Oh Brother D you're trying to tell us
[1:06:56] this that we all got to right believe
[1:06:58] what we want
[1:07:02] too what is the gain saying or have gone
[1:07:06] in the way of
[1:07:10] Cain what is the way of
[1:07:14] Cain you hear a lot preached about
[1:07:18] they'll bypass that and they grab into
[1:07:19] bam and all and G say in the cor you
[1:07:23] don't hear much mention about
[1:07:25] oain but we just read from the
[1:07:28] prophet three quotes about Kan in his
[1:07:33] ways so the way of Cain is what very
[1:07:40] religious very
[1:07:45] good feed the witow US is that kind of
[1:07:49] what we remember about the Pharisees and
[1:07:51] the
[1:07:52] thing
[1:07:56] who the scripture said is
[1:07:59] there when the babies was born and you
[1:08:02] dedicated him brother random listened to
[1:08:03] him the other day you kind old
[1:08:07] priest he was comparing the kind old
[1:08:09] priest to Jesus and Jesus running them
[1:08:12] out of the temple and the kind old
[1:08:14] priest and how nice he was the way of
[1:08:19] Cain the way of Cain is a very good
[1:08:24] Church
[1:08:29] person
[1:08:31] worshiping
[1:08:37] sacrificing see
[1:08:41] church if we're coming to church to just
[1:08:44] keep somebody from beating on
[1:08:47] us for not coming that's right we might
[1:08:51] as well quit that's right
[1:08:55] if all we want is worship
[1:08:58] and doing good we'll go right over
[1:09:03] here and we'll send missionaries to the
[1:09:07] world and we'll shout Glory
[1:09:11] Hallelujah and we'll have a big
[1:09:14] time that's the ways of Cain that's
[1:09:22] right more churches today than ever
[1:09:27] before and look at the people of this
[1:09:32] message building million multi-million
[1:09:35] dollar buildings saying the Lord's
[1:09:37] coming
[1:09:38] tomorrow nothing I ain't said a word
[1:09:41] about nobody got a brand new church it'd
[1:09:43] be nice if we had one and we could have
[1:09:46] one if we wanted it but we don't do
[1:09:48] it
[1:09:52] okay
[1:09:55] but could I take this the rest of the
[1:09:57] afternoon to talk about Cain and his
[1:10:05] ways but just
[1:10:07] remember every quote that we've
[1:10:10] given Cain wound up
[1:10:12] saying take it or leave
[1:10:16] it now God left
[1:10:22] it you mean you want to shout and
[1:10:24] worship and and run the aisles and and
[1:10:28] help the food the poor and and do
[1:10:30] everything Brother
[1:10:34] D I just know that's the way of Cain
[1:10:39] right unless you're really truly a born
[1:10:42] again
[1:10:43] Christian a born again
[1:10:48] Christian is a a display of your faith
[1:10:52] that's right in an outward show of
[1:10:55] Christianity of the inside
[1:10:58] right way of
[1:11:01] can you just think about some of those
[1:11:05] people and you know you've been around
[1:11:07] here long enough so don't play games
[1:11:09] with me I don't play with you okay you
[1:11:13] know that we're not against anything or
[1:11:15] anybody but you know yourself there's
[1:11:17] people right over there in that building
[1:11:19] as far as what we look at as the uh
[1:11:23] roots of the
[1:11:25] spirit will make us ashamed of
[1:11:34] oursel
[1:11:36] right don't you know good people out in
[1:11:39] organized religion that would just that
[1:11:41] give you anything in the world and do
[1:11:42] anything in the world for
[1:11:46] you but you see they think that's what's
[1:11:48] going to get them to
[1:11:50] Heaven Cain thought what he was offering
[1:11:52] was going to get him to heaven or
[1:11:53] getting back in the garden you
[1:12:01] know what about
[1:12:03] it why would God speak of the way of
[1:12:08] Cain and related in with the way of
[1:12:16] balam that cursed Israel and all those
[1:12:18] things for money and doing
[1:12:22] thing and put it right in with the gains
[1:12:26] sayings of
[1:12:29] Kora the Kora stood there and says Moses
[1:12:33] you take too much on
[1:12:35] yourself they spelled c r e
[1:12:40] here with it's k o r a h I think over in
[1:12:44] the Old
[1:12:49] Testament and he puts Cain right in
[1:12:51] there with him
[1:12:54] what about the next one then 1 John
[1:12:59] 3:12 why would God
[1:13:02] say not as
[1:13:04] Cain who was of that Wicked
[1:13:09] one well I mean he he was just he was
[1:13:11] just motivated by the
[1:13:13] devil and slew his
[1:13:20] brother pretty bad
[1:13:22] motivation
[1:13:26] and wherefore slew he him or in other
[1:13:28] words why did he kill
[1:13:33] Abel because his own Works were evil
[1:13:38] that's
[1:13:39] right and his brothers
[1:13:45] righteous that's why he's called a
[1:13:47] wicked
[1:13:52] one all
[1:13:55] right who is that Wicked one 1 John
[1:14:00] 2:13 I write unto your fathers because
[1:14:03] you have known him that is from the
[1:14:05] beginning I write unto young men because
[1:14:07] you have
[1:14:09] overcome the wicked
[1:14:11] one so it's easy to know who the wicked
[1:14:14] one is if somebody's overcome it you
[1:14:17] know in the Christian Walk The Wicked
[1:14:19] one is the devil
[1:14:21] right is any problem with around him
[1:14:23] when he'd say he said see th Cain was
[1:14:26] the son of the
[1:14:30] devil now we know he wasn't a son of the
[1:14:33] devil if he's anything he's a son of the
[1:14:36] Beast
[1:14:40] right what about Jesus in
[1:14:43] Matthew
[1:14:46] 13:38 the field is the
[1:14:48] world the good seed are the children of
[1:14:51] the Kingdom but the T
[1:14:54] are the children of the wicked
[1:15:03] one if that's saying anything at all
[1:15:06] it's saying they are children of the
[1:15:08] kingdom and they are children of the
[1:15:11] devil that's
[1:15:14] right Jude 1:14
[1:15:18] look and Ed Enoch also the seventh from
[1:15:22] Adam
[1:15:23] prophesied of these things saying behold
[1:15:27] the Lord cometh with 10 thousands of his
[1:15:29] Saints as I ended up this morning saying
[1:15:33] where can you
[1:15:34] find in any
[1:15:38] lineage of Adam or of
[1:15:41] Jesus Cain
[1:15:48] mentioned not in the
[1:15:52] lineage but because if he was in the
[1:15:54] lmage he'd have been the eighth from
[1:15:58] Adam if I can count it read your
[1:16:06] Bible
[1:16:11] no see you you would be messing up Enoch
[1:16:14] you put Cain in there Enoch would have
[1:16:16] been the eighth from
[1:16:22] Adam
[1:16:24] look at Genesis 5 and
[1:16:28] 1 through three this is the book of the
[1:16:30] generations of
[1:16:32] Adam in the day that God created man in
[1:16:34] the likeness of God made he him male and
[1:16:37] female created he them and blessed them
[1:16:38] and called their name Adam in the day
[1:16:40] that they were created and Adam lived
[1:16:43] 130 years and beg got a son in his own
[1:16:52] likeness after his
[1:16:55] image and did he call his name
[1:16:59] Cain or
[1:17:01] Seth the Abel has no
[1:17:05] lineage no children so you don't count
[1:17:07] him in a
[1:17:08] lineage right Cain had children you
[1:17:11] counted in a
[1:17:13] lineage but remember Cain was supposed
[1:17:15] to been the
[1:17:17] firstborn the first born was supposed to
[1:17:19] been the birthright so if there was
[1:17:22] either one to spiritual of Cain and Abel
[1:17:24] it was supposed to been
[1:17:28] Cain because he's the
[1:17:35] firstborn but Adam had a son
[1:17:38] finally in his own image and his own
[1:17:41] likeness called his name
[1:17:44] Seth remember what I saying the reason
[1:17:47] he doesn't mention Abel is Abel had no
[1:17:51] lineage this is the
[1:17:53] Generations
[1:17:56] right so the generation of Adam went
[1:17:59] from
[1:18:01] Adam who
[1:18:07] seith right amen Bible proves it's
[1:18:12] right look in Luke 3 and
[1:18:16] 37 remember this is going backward now
[1:18:20] so which was the son of
[1:18:24] M that's not Matthew lar that's a you I
[1:18:29] don't which was the son of Enoch which
[1:18:31] was the son of Jared which was the son
[1:18:33] of Mel which was the son of
[1:18:36] Kaa that's not
[1:18:38] Cain which was the son of Enos which was
[1:18:41] the son of Seth which was the son of
[1:18:43] Adam which was the son of
[1:18:46] God no
[1:18:48] mention and
[1:18:50] that is the lineage of Jesus
[1:18:59] right you said it didn't start over no
[1:19:01] huh come on started over there about
[1:19:03] David or
[1:19:06] somewhere and just remember to anybody
[1:19:09] that don't know it you can't run the
[1:19:11] lineage of Jesus and bring it down to Jo
[1:19:14] I mean to Mary it comes to Joseph
[1:19:17] because the men are the only listing of
[1:19:19] the
[1:19:20] lineages just in case somebody come
[1:19:22] along than you goofing up let you know
[1:19:25] we do know a little
[1:19:28] bit but just think about
[1:19:35] it if I get into the next I ain't going
[1:19:37] to get nowhere so we'll quit we take
[1:19:40] that up Wednesday night we're talking
[1:19:42] about the mark of the beast
[1:19:45] Wednesday but I just want you to
[1:19:48] think what we're trying to
[1:19:51] show using the the Bible to
[1:19:56] show what God had to say about
[1:20:01] Cain and
[1:20:05] remember when the children of Israel
[1:20:07] went into the promised land who did they
[1:20:12] meet the
[1:20:16] Canaanites
[1:20:20] right see God doesn't speak too good of
[1:20:24] Cain you know
[1:20:27] why because he turned God
[1:20:29] down God offered him
[1:20:33] salvation right but he wouldn't take
[1:20:38] it so
[1:20:41] thereby God could
[1:20:44] predetermine the line of
[1:20:46] Cain and the line of Cain would run
[1:20:51] into some pretty pretty bad
[1:20:54] lineages well it ain't much worse than
[1:20:58] going over on the other side though but
[1:21:01] still it does run it into some pretty
[1:21:03] bad
[1:21:06] lineages
[1:21:08] right would you say brother Dale could
[1:21:10] we be of Cain or could we be of when we
[1:21:13] we've got to be from Cain or we've got
[1:21:15] to be from Abel you know what I mean I
[1:21:17] mean uh Seth coming from
[1:21:21] Adam we got to be of one of the
[1:21:24] two if you want to run your
[1:21:27] DNA but once you reach the flood what
[1:21:30] would you
[1:21:31] do when you only have the sons of
[1:21:36] Noah you know ham sham and
[1:21:43] and what about when you get over to
[1:21:46] Jacob and Esau both Mom and Daddy holy
[1:21:50] parents but Jacob and Esau
[1:21:53] saw one seemingly of God the other
[1:21:55] seemingly of the
[1:22:02] devil but see Church my whole point of
[1:22:06] one thing this afternoon is what I said
[1:22:09] let's don't look back there and see what
[1:22:11] they done and spend so much time about
[1:22:14] what they done and proving what they
[1:22:16] done and running genealogies and
[1:22:20] Etc you might find out you're on the
[1:22:23] wrong side that's right well what if you
[1:22:28] do are you going to let that hinder
[1:22:35] you if it is then you're going to have
[1:22:38] to take a lot out of the
[1:22:43] Bible
[1:22:46] especially the Gentile
[1:22:51] bride
[1:22:57] right come
[1:23:00] on folks we ain't nothing but Gentiles
[1:23:02] they don't make no difference who mom
[1:23:04] and daddy is the Bible says that it'll
[1:23:06] come a time when they won't say the mom
[1:23:08] and daddy ate grapes and the children
[1:23:10] teeths on the edge or something like
[1:23:11] that paraphrasing it we have to stand
[1:23:18] alone you know a lot of people think if
[1:23:21] you was illegitimate
[1:23:23] that you cannot be saved that's been
[1:23:26] taught in this
[1:23:29] message
[1:23:31] well I don't care to say
[1:23:34] it everybody I'm looking at or everybody
[1:23:37] on the internet's hearing this is
[1:23:38] illegitimate and so am
[1:23:42] I brother brandham said I've got it
[1:23:44] laying for the next message he said we
[1:23:46] were all bastard
[1:23:48] born
[1:23:50] hybrid he said I don't care what what is
[1:23:52] Prophet priest or
[1:23:58] King but you
[1:24:00] see we're
[1:24:02] Gentiles no
[1:24:04] promise
[1:24:06] right but oh how wonderful it is to look
[1:24:09] down through there and see that Rahab
[1:24:12] the Harlot
[1:24:13] appear and see Ruth appear see those
[1:24:17] things start
[1:24:19] happening but then one day to realize
[1:24:23] did he come after a gentile
[1:24:29] bride I'll get back to it in a couple of
[1:24:31] messages later on or maybe next maybe
[1:24:36] Wednesday I want to talk about that seed
[1:24:39] of the
[1:24:46] woman might find out that's who we
[1:24:50] are no that was Jesus well I thought we
[1:24:53] was Miss
[1:24:54] Jesus I didn't know we was too bad
[1:25:00] off brother random calls the Jews the
[1:25:03] remnant of the woman's
[1:25:08] seed then who's the woman's
[1:25:11] seed give you that to thank
[1:25:15] on you see Church ain't but one thing is
[1:25:18] worth
[1:25:19] anything and that's Jesus Christ
[1:25:23] amen no matter what we think of how good
[1:25:26] we are my family came over on the M
[1:25:30] flow well Glory Hallelujah mine probably
[1:25:33] slipped over on a canoe
[1:25:35] somewhere well what am I concerned
[1:25:40] about you know Wars are started over
[1:25:44] people that are trying to Lord over
[1:25:47] other
[1:25:48] people or think they're better than
[1:25:50] other people that's
[1:25:54] right what about a religious society
[1:25:59] today and it be right in the middle of
[1:26:03] the way of Cain that's right
[1:26:08] am most religious people's ever
[1:26:13] been make you and I shamed of ourselves
[1:26:16] in life livings and doings and working
[1:26:18] for
[1:26:21] God
[1:26:24] the way of
[1:26:28] Kain going to
[1:26:31] church worshiping singing shouting
[1:26:43] Hallelujah but I've got some other
[1:26:45] quotes in there where the Prophet says
[1:26:47] take it or leave
[1:26:51] it
[1:26:52] take it or leave it Cain
[1:26:57] said now did Cain go before God and say
[1:27:00] now God dares my offering take it or
[1:27:01] leave it come on get sensible just for a
[1:27:04] second I'll quit is that what he said no
[1:27:06] he didn't say that did
[1:27:09] he when brother Brandon brought it down
[1:27:12] to human terminologies that's what he
[1:27:15] said do you think the denominational
[1:27:17] churches and you think the followers of
[1:27:19] this message do you think Lula is trying
[1:27:22] to be of the
[1:27:25] devil
[1:27:28] no people are wanting to
[1:27:32] worship we're born to worship we're born
[1:27:35] to sing we're born
[1:27:38] to worship
[1:27:41] God go to a country where there's never
[1:27:44] even heard of the name Jesus and they're
[1:27:46] out there worshiping
[1:27:51] God
[1:27:53] you know those people might be in better
[1:27:55] shape than we
[1:27:58] are just remember my
[1:28:01] point why did God put Cain right in
[1:28:06] with
[1:28:08] bam and
[1:28:11] Kora and why would God say he's of that
[1:28:14] Wicked
[1:28:17] one because his
[1:28:20] deeds was wrong
[1:28:24] so the best came
[1:28:26] done was worth
[1:28:31] nothing brother Dale see folks listen I
[1:28:35] have one
[1:28:37] desire that's not to build a church and
[1:28:40] build a great I have one desire to
[1:28:43] preach to your soul until that Soul
[1:28:46] makes a decision for almighty God
[1:28:51] am
[1:28:54] but not like brother dick talking about
[1:28:55] that lady or girl in the Presbyterian
[1:28:57] said well I never didn't know I was
[1:28:59] lost something to that
[1:29:02] degree been in church all my
[1:29:05] life never know that's lost of a pastor
[1:29:08] daughter of a pastor never know that's
[1:29:18] lost come on musicians what do you think
[1:29:21] of about
[1:29:22] it come on
[1:29:25] brother what do you think about
[1:29:29] it are we
[1:29:32] saying I believe the message CU remember
[1:29:36] the quote from the prophet
[1:29:38] was that Cain knew Abel's message was
[1:29:43] right because he saw God
[1:29:47] Vindicated now there's nobody in the
[1:29:50] world would have argued in the now they
[1:29:52] will now because of the garbage can but
[1:29:55] in the times when brother Brandon was
[1:29:56] standing here there was nobody would
[1:29:58] challenge his
[1:30:00] message
[1:30:03] right no
[1:30:05] way and he could say if
[1:30:08] I'm right let God
[1:30:11] come and he said now if you brothers are
[1:30:13] right said you get up here and do
[1:30:17] it right but you know what they wouldn't
[1:30:20] have nothing to do with that they
[1:30:21] wouldn't get up and go up there
[1:30:23] no but then they went
[1:30:26] out and they had to get oil on their
[1:30:30] hands and their foreheads they had to
[1:30:32] get some kind of a workup of a
[1:30:35] situation and who could deny a lot of
[1:30:38] them were wonderful
[1:30:40] people I have one man in mind that
[1:30:44] people would you call his name and
[1:30:45] people say oh no it's right but I know
[1:30:47] some record behind the man that he used
[1:30:49] to when he leave to go out on the field
[1:30:51] for an Evangelistic trip he gave his
[1:30:54] people that went with him so much money
[1:30:57] to spend on their own needs you
[1:31:00] know and that money run out he told him
[1:31:03] you go home do
[1:31:05] whatever I ain't giving you another dime
[1:31:08] of God's
[1:31:12] money there's been great
[1:31:15] wonderful
[1:31:18] moves in the religious Realm
[1:31:22] but could it be the way of
[1:31:31] Cain keep in mind the prophet said he
[1:31:35] did
[1:31:36] worship he did worship God he said I
[1:31:40] don't doubt you God I believe in
[1:31:44] you remember Eve was not saying I don't
[1:31:48] believe in
[1:31:50] God
[1:31:54] what about it what do we got
[1:31:57] brother let's Stand Together 29 in the
[1:32:00] red book anybody has a
[1:32:07] need
[1:32:09] all my
[1:32:13] freely I will ever all the brothers are
[1:32:18] getting ready for the
[1:32:20] communion
[1:32:22] dud he went to
[1:32:50] the
[1:33:17] heard our sister she's speaking for
[1:33:20] somebody else that's a wonderful
[1:33:22] thing and you heard her testimony I
[1:33:24] heard her thoughts of what she believes
[1:33:26] so we believe with her that all is going
[1:33:28] to be
[1:33:30] well and just reach down and touch our
[1:33:33] buddy Lord in Jesus
[1:33:36] name anybody else before we go into the
[1:33:45] communion
[1:33:50] holy
[1:34:01] we believe in that some good people
[1:34:03] there good
[1:34:05] kids but tell you Bill F father let all
[1:34:09] be well in Jesus
[1:34:12] name anybody
[1:34:15] else
[1:34:19] savior anybody else before we go into
[1:34:21] the
[1:34:22] communion oh to
[1:34:25] Jesus I
[1:34:29] Surrender give my St to thee fill me
[1:34:35] with
[1:34:37] the
[1:34:44] power I
[1:34:47] Surrender get everything right and ready
[1:34:49] for the communion
[1:34:55] all All to
[1:35:00] Jesus I
[1:35:03] Surrender
[1:35:06] oh amen we come to this time that
[1:35:08] musicians can go ahead be seated or go
[1:35:11] back to your church we come to this time
[1:35:15] of the communion and we want all things
[1:35:18] well don't we I don't want to be found
[1:35:21] falling after
[1:35:23] Cain I want something from a genuine
[1:35:26] experience in my heart to love God and
[1:35:28] let my Works Bea
[1:35:31] display not to something that I
[1:35:33] think would get me into
[1:35:36] heaven being Good's not going to get us
[1:35:38] into heaven right being good really gets
[1:35:41] in our
[1:35:43] way because the Lost are the ones who
[1:35:47] are more willing to receive Christ those
[1:35:50] that know they're wrong
[1:35:52] and people that's been raised all their
[1:35:54] life in church and doing good so let's
[1:35:57] just think about it all right let's go
[1:35:59] into our scripture and just read
[1:36:03] it 1 Corinthians 11:23 for I have
[1:36:06] received of the Lord that which also I
[1:36:08] delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus
[1:36:10] the same night in which he was betrayed
[1:36:13] took bread and when he had given thanks
[1:36:15] he break it and said take eat this is my
[1:36:17] body which is broken for you this do in
[1:36:19] remembrance of me after the same manner
[1:36:21] also he took the cup when he had s
[1:36:24] saying this cup is the New Testament in
[1:36:26] my blood this do ye as of as you drink
[1:36:28] it in remembrance of me for as often as
[1:36:31] you eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:36:33] you do you the Lord's death till he come
[1:36:36] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:36:39] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:36:40] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:36:43] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:36:45] examine himself so let him eat of that
[1:36:47] bread and drink of that cup for he that
[1:36:49] eateth and drinketh unworthily E eateth
[1:36:51] and drinketh Damnation to himself not
[1:36:53] Discerning the Lord's body for this
[1:36:56] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:36:58] and many sleep for if we would judge
[1:37:00] ourselves we should not be judged but
[1:37:03] when we are judged we are chasen to the
[1:37:05] Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:37:07] with the world wherefore my brethren
[1:37:09] when you come together to eat t one for
[1:37:11] another and if any man hunger let him
[1:37:13] eat at home that you come not together
[1:37:15] under condemnation the rest always set
[1:37:17] in order when I come so let's just have
[1:37:20] a few moment moment of Silent prayer and
[1:37:22] just praying one for another and that
[1:37:24] the Lord would bless and heal the sick
[1:37:26] among us and deliver and guide each
[1:37:45] one just have your way Lord in each one
[1:37:47] of our hearts and lives we commit it to
[1:37:50] you now in Jesus name
[1:37:55] the Bible said he took bread and blessed
[1:37:56] it father we thank you for this bread
[1:37:59] has been made for this purpose this
[1:38:01] afternoon and now as we come together to
[1:38:04] partake of it we pray that you would
[1:38:06] just first of all remove all our
[1:38:08] problems from us the sins of our life
[1:38:11] the the Disobedience the things Lord
[1:38:13] that would be a hindrance and make us to
[1:38:15] be what you want us to be we love you
[1:38:18] father and we thank you and we commit
[1:38:20] everything into your hands and we know
[1:38:22] this is not the body of our Lord and
[1:38:24] savior this is only an assemble but as
[1:38:27] we partake of the symbol we thank you
[1:38:28] for the truth of all things we love you
[1:38:30] and we just pray that you'd bless
[1:38:33] sanctify this bread and sanctify the
[1:38:36] partakers in Jesus name
[1:38:47] amen what a wonderful
[1:38:50] opportunity to know the
[1:38:53] truth there was a time we struggled even
[1:38:56] over the
[1:38:58] bread the things you know argued and
[1:39:02] fussed over what was right and what was
[1:39:05] wrong on this line or that line just
[1:39:07] even about the communion the things you
[1:39:10] know and
[1:39:11] uh so it's great to know the
[1:39:15] truth and to know that God is real and
[1:39:19] his word is real
[1:39:21] and then none of us are
[1:39:24] worthy to take the communion we're not
[1:39:28] the best Among Us is not
[1:39:30] worthy but he made us
[1:39:32] worthy he told us to come boldly Before
[1:39:35] the
[1:39:35] Throne all right now that doesn't mean
[1:39:38] well I bless God I'm walking up I'm a
[1:39:39] Child of
[1:39:40] God that's not boldly that's
[1:39:44] stupidity boldness in the scriptural
[1:39:46] terms of what it's speaking of there is
[1:39:49] to realize
[1:39:52] our daddy is inviting
[1:39:54] us L inviting us to
[1:40:00] come to a
[1:40:02] feast what happened in the garden I've
[1:40:05] tried my best to make it where we'd see
[1:40:07] it that God never just run off and quit
[1:40:10] when everything went
[1:40:12] wrong he was right there right he said
[1:40:16] I'll go with you we'll get to that where
[1:40:17] Adam and Eve leaving out of the
[1:40:19] garden he said said I'll go with
[1:40:24] you that's something in it father we
[1:40:27] thank you for this wine It's Made for
[1:40:28] This purpose and now we ask you to just
[1:40:30] sanctify the wine and the partakers that
[1:40:32] we may all be together as one in you and
[1:40:35] just have your way in our hearts and
[1:40:37] life we love you and we thank you in
[1:40:39] Jesus
[1:40:46] name come
[1:40:48] morning I walk
[1:40:51] by the
[1:40:54] river I'll rest need the
[1:40:59] Ever Green
[1:41:02] Tree I'll
[1:41:05] carry my cross through the
[1:41:10] midnight come
[1:41:13] morning there's
[1:41:15] glory for
[1:41:19] me sometimes I'm
[1:41:23] despise and
[1:41:26] reject and I question oh
[1:41:31] Father how
[1:41:34] long then I take
[1:41:37] one more
[1:41:39] look at Mount
[1:41:43] Calvary and it gives me the strength to
[1:41:49] go on
[1:41:51] come
[1:41:53] morning
[1:41:55] our by the
[1:41:58] river I'll rest NE the
[1:42:03] Ever Green
[1:42:06] Tree I'll
[1:42:09] carry my cross through the
[1:42:14] midnight come
[1:42:17] morning there's
[1:42:19] Glory for
[1:42:22] me what a time what about how close we
[1:42:26] are to the
[1:42:28] end as I said there the other day
[1:42:30] talking about it like brother Carol said
[1:42:33] that time he said I'm 80 I think he's 80
[1:42:35] or something like that he said the
[1:42:38] coming of the Lord or either death's
[1:42:40] going to get me and said both of them's
[1:42:42] pretty close something to that degree
[1:42:45] you know because that's
[1:42:47] true you know we're one breath away from
[1:42:52] death and yet we live like we got a an
[1:42:57] eternity to
[1:42:59] live you know no we don't have that to
[1:43:03] live we only have what God promised us
[1:43:05] told him the other day I said I'm
[1:43:08] already three years into bared
[1:43:10] time three years is already
[1:43:13] bared you
[1:43:16] know well that's
[1:43:19] wonderful I'm enjoying it
[1:43:22] myself what because it's it's
[1:43:25] wonderful to know and realize the truth
[1:43:27] of God and to be able to see
[1:43:31] it what a wonderful
[1:43:34] thing to know God is truth in
[1:43:37] life brother R said not even to know his
[1:43:42] word cuz see we can know his word and
[1:43:44] not know
[1:43:45] God right we can know about God right
[1:43:49] without an experience with God that's
[1:43:51] right that's what we were talking about
[1:43:53] last night at the Bible study it was
[1:43:55] brought up I said there's a vast
[1:43:56] difference between where brother B said
[1:43:58] you could have the baptism of the Holy
[1:43:59] Ghost without a
[1:44:05] sensation but he never said you could
[1:44:07] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:44:08] without an
[1:44:09] experience I've never read that one a
[1:44:12] sensation is a stimulation Upon Our
[1:44:15] human fleshly beings or parts an
[1:44:19] experience is something you live
[1:44:23] through so you can have a sensation and
[1:44:27] think you're saved right now here's the
[1:44:31] one thing brother brandham and that's
[1:44:32] what we ended with last
[1:44:34] night brother brandham said it used to
[1:44:37] be that Satan told you you was
[1:44:42] lost but he said now he tells you you're
[1:44:48] saved that's a deception
[1:44:52] right to tell us we're
[1:44:58] saved if he tells us if he tells you
[1:45:01] that you're so saved you don't need
[1:45:02] anything else then I'm going to tell you
[1:45:04] that's a lie of the
[1:45:07] devil because the prophet was seeking
[1:45:10] after God every moment of his life to
[1:45:12] the day that he died to know more about
[1:45:16] him let's all partake
[1:45:19] together
[1:45:28] you can be seated for a
[1:45:36] moment we go into John
[1:45:42] 13 and supper being ended the devil
[1:45:46] having now put into the heart of Judas
[1:45:48] his carrot Simon's son to betray
[1:45:52] him Jesus knowing that the father had
[1:45:54] given all things into his hands and he
