[2:40] how they're gonna how how that's gonna
[2:42] happen so tonight i wanna speak on about
[2:45] being hidden away in the time of trouble
[2:46] if we turn to psalms chapter 27
[2:49] and read a few scriptures tonight
[2:52] lord god we're so grateful to be able to
[2:53] gather together in your word lord and
[2:55] we're so grateful to have our comfort
[2:57] lord in the time of trouble when when we
[2:59] see people dying and we see afflictions
[3:01] all around and we see people it seems
[3:03] like people are going crazy in the world
[3:05] and making horrible decisions and doing
[3:07] strange things and madness people
[3:09] killing one another in the in the
[3:10] schools and all sorts of things it's
[3:12] trouble on every hand but yet you've
[3:14] given us a hiding place in the time of
[3:16] trouble you've given us a way of escape
[3:19] lord we're so grateful oh god for the
[3:21] comfort that you've given it to us
[3:23] a comfort that the world doesn't know
[3:25] anything about lord but you've given
[3:27] you've given us a comfort and a joy that
[3:29] when things go wrong all around
[3:32] something within the springs up that
[3:33] know who will guard it this is this life
[3:35] is not all there is but
[3:38] there's so much more than what even we
[3:40] can see with our own eyes
[3:42] lord tonight i pray lord that you'll
[3:44] just bless this service lord god and
[3:45] bless and edify the people lord that
[3:48] they might receive and be strengthened
[3:49] lord and encourage tonight lord god that
[3:51] they'll receive something that they'll
[3:53] be able to fight this battle a little
[3:54] bit a little bit more with lord we ask
[3:57] your blessing upon the reading of your
[3:58] word
[4:00] and psalms chapter 27 says
[4:02] a psalm of david the lord is my light
[4:05] and my salvation
[4:07] whom shall i fear
[4:10] the lord is the strength of my life of
[4:12] whom shall i be afraid
[4:15] when the wicked even my enemies and my
[4:18] foes
[4:19] came upon me to eat up my flesh they
[4:21] stumbled
[4:22] and failed
[4:24] you believe david was speaking from an
[4:25] experience that he had been through some
[4:27] stuff
[4:28] and he had seen god fight his battles
[4:30] for him and knew
[4:31] that there was a hiding place in time of
[4:33] trouble
[4:35] but he said though and host should
[4:36] encamp against me
[4:38] my heart shall not fear
[4:40] the war should rise against me
[4:43] and this will i be confident
[4:45] one thing have i desired of the lord
[4:47] that will i seek after
[4:49] that i may dwell in the house of the
[4:52] lord all the days of my life
[4:55] now that's that's something to desire in
[4:57] it amen if that's your one desire to
[4:59] dwell in his house not money riches fame
[5:01] popularity but to dwell in the house of
[5:03] the lord
[5:04] to behold the beauty of the lord and to
[5:06] inquire in his temple
[5:08] for in the time of trouble he shall hide
[5:11] me in his pavilion
[5:13] in the secret of his tabernacle shall he
[5:15] hide me
[5:16] he shall set me up upon a rock
[5:19] you may be seated
[5:21] the lord had his blessing
[5:25] so david's talking about in the time of
[5:27] a time of trouble in the time of trouble
[5:29] we've got a promise that when there's
[5:31] trouble on every hand that that god is
[5:33] there
[5:34] and and you know
[5:36] you can begin to think really when
[5:38] there's trouble
[5:39] that's almost to prove to a christian
[5:41] that god is there you can trust that
[5:43] when there's trouble on every hand god
[5:44] is going to be there
[5:46] i i i don't have the quote on a hand but
[5:49] it just come to come to come to my mind
[5:51] now while i'm speaking there's a place
[5:52] where brother adam says that you can
[5:53] look around at the the way that the
[5:56] world is getting and it's getting darker
[5:58] and darker and
[5:59] more more evil and and that's a proof
[6:02] that's a sign that on the other hand
[6:04] while the world's getting darker and
[6:05] darker
[6:06] there's something moving in the bride
[6:08] that's becoming greater and greater and
[6:10] greater why because when there's trouble
[6:12] then god will raise up a standard he'll
[6:14] raise up his word
[6:16] and and
[6:17] in psalm 46 it says god is our refuge
[6:20] and strength a very present help in time
[6:22] of trouble a very present help in
[6:25] trouble and we can have confidence in
[6:26] those words that when trouble comes that
[6:28] god
[6:29] god we've got we've got a high priest
[6:30] that can be touched by the feelings of
[6:32] our infirmities he knows the things that
[6:34] we're going through
[6:35] he was there at the grave of lazarus
[6:37] when lazarus was was was laid to rest
[6:41] in the grave and he knows
[6:43] the things that we're going through
[6:48] no matter what your struggle no matter
[6:49] what your
[6:50] your uh
[6:52] your your your lot in life the place you
[6:54] are in life god god whether you're a
[6:56] little child whether you're an adult a
[6:58] grown person what wherever you are god
[7:01] knows what you're going through and he's
[7:02] somebody that can be touched by the
[7:04] feelings of our infirmity and the bible
[7:06] says here in psalm chapter 27 in the
[7:09] secret of his tabernacle shall he hide
[7:11] me he shall set me up upon a rock now
[7:14] there's there's where you get into a
[7:16] hiding place where he says he'll hide me
[7:18] in this pavilion he'll set me up on a
[7:19] rock there's there's your hiding place
[7:22] where you've got a foundation where you
[7:24] can rest assured knowing something i i i
[7:28] know what
[7:29] sometimes when we come to church and and
[7:32] we go through life but when you come to
[7:33] the end of the life and you come to that
[7:35] place where you're going down in the
[7:36] grave and you need to know that that the
[7:39] sting of death has been taken away that
[7:42] that christ is covered over your sins
[7:44] that he's that you believe that the the
[7:46] the everything's been paid for
[7:49] you've got to be set up upon a rock
[7:52] in matthew chapter 7 it says there's
[7:54] therefore whosoever heareth these
[7:56] sayings of mine and doeth them i will
[7:58] liken him unto a wise man which built
[8:00] his house upon a rock and what kind of a
[8:02] rock are we talking about we're talking
[8:04] about a rock of revelation
[8:07] what's this got to do with a rapture
[8:08] brother bob a rapture is going to be a
[8:11] revelation so that's why brother brown
[8:13] talks about he sets the stage when he's
[8:15] preaching this sermon the rapture that
[8:17] you you he shall set me up upon a rock
[8:19] you've got to you've got to your whole
[8:21] christian journey starts with a
[8:23] revelation of jesus christ
[8:25] everything is built upon a revelation of
[8:27] who he is and that builds and builds and
[8:30] builds until it culminates until you
[8:32] begin to realize i am going in a rapture
[8:35] you know that you're gonna take a body
[8:37] change the whole thing is a revelation
[8:40] amen now in psalm chapter 42 it says he
[8:43] brought me up also out of a horrible pit
[8:46] out of the miry clay and set my feet
[8:48] upon a rock now you think about think
[8:50] about a man
[8:53] think about a man or a woman
[8:55] we i think we all got that testimony
[8:57] sitting here tonight that
[8:59] one day in life we were walking along
[9:00] and our feet would get stuck in the miry
[9:03] clay of sin and and life and and and and
[9:06] we needed somebody to pluck us out and
[9:08] set our feet up on a rock that was
[9:10] something where we could walk where we
[9:12] could walk straight well we knew what we
[9:14] were doing here what our purpose was
[9:16] that that we knew who our mama and daddy
[9:18] was who our father was and where we came
[9:20] from and
[9:22] and you see you you've got to be set
[9:24] upon a rock if you're in a mirey clay
[9:26] you don't know where you're going and
[9:28] what life is all about but to be set
[9:30] upon a rock now brother madam said as
[9:32] you grow older as you grow older then
[9:34] you begin from making your first couple
[9:36] steps and toddle and fall and get up and
[9:38] try it again then you after a while you
[9:40] get so you can walk a straight line so
[9:43] you're plucked up out of the mirey clay
[9:45] then you're put in a place where you can
[9:47] begin to walk and you get you begin to
[9:49] grow and you begin to mature and he said
[9:51] now that's what we've got to do as
[9:53] soldiers of the cross
[9:55] now is the time to walk a straight line
[9:58] right down that highway to glory and i
[10:01] believe that when you're set up on that
[10:02] rock set up on a foundation of the
[10:04] revelation of jesus christ your position
[10:07] to be able to walk and that walk that
[10:09] straight like straight as the gate
[10:11] narrows the way and you've got you're
[10:13] equipped for that journey you're
[10:15] equipped to walk that walk now now it's
[10:19] what he's trying to say is that now is a
[10:21] time to walk that straight now is the
[10:23] time that we should be able to walk as
[10:26] mature christians now is the time that
[10:28] we are set up we're positioned so that
[10:30] we should be able to walk that way he
[10:33] said i do believe that we are living in
[10:35] the closing scenes of the history of
[10:37] this world i truly believe that the
[10:39] coming of the lord is closer perhaps
[10:42] than we think the coming of the i i
[10:44] believe it's just we're right on the
[10:45] cusp of seeing god moving our lives in a
[10:48] way that maybe we had never seen before
[10:51] we're right at the cusp of god doing
[10:53] something right right there at the edge
[10:56] of
[10:56] stepping over into glory and right there
[10:59] where we'll one day we'll may be in the
[11:00] kitchen and we'll turn around and
[11:02] there'll be mama and daddy or whatever
[11:05] your loved one's standing there and you
[11:07] begin to realize that something has
[11:09] happened in your life you are going to
[11:11] be changed we're right at that cusp
[11:14] now he said there's two
[11:17] you realize what we've what we've been
[11:18] given in this tower we've been given a
[11:20] message something to believe and he said
[11:22] there's too much supernatural
[11:24] vindication of god's written word of
[11:26] this hour for something not to be
[11:28] approaching us now
[11:30] there's too much supernatural
[11:31] vindication he said it's too real it
[11:34] would be astounding to you just to let
[11:36] you know that what is really taking
[11:38] place
[11:40] think about all those places where he
[11:41] would preach those deep sermons and say
[11:43] if you really recognize what was taking
[11:45] place now i i i surely were coming to a
[11:49] place where we can recognize what the
[11:50] purpose of the message was for to
[11:52] recognize what it's doing in our lives
[11:55] surely we come to a place now where we
[11:57] can walk this straight narrow and he
[11:59] said what the he said the message of the
[12:01] hour is god's promise of this hour that
[12:04] he promised what he would do and you see
[12:07] he was told he was trying to explain to
[12:09] the people that you hear so much about
[12:10] the message of the hour what is the
[12:12] message of the hour the message of the
[12:14] hour the message of the hour and martin
[12:16] luther's day was a way to get out of the
[12:18] catholic dogmas and all the works the
[12:20] message of the hour and john wesley's
[12:22] day was a message that would bring a
[12:25] sanctified life and the message of the
[12:27] hour and the pentecostal age was a
[12:29] message it was a promise for their day a
[12:32] promise of the restoration of the gifts
[12:34] that god promised it and the message of
[12:36] the hour and hour there is a fulfillment
[12:39] of what god had promised
[12:41] god promised it and when god promises
[12:43] anything he's going to bring it to pass
[12:45] god promised the message he promised he
[12:48] promised a messenger in this day to send
[12:51] us a message to give us rapturing faith
[12:53] and when god promises something it will
[12:55] come to pass why because in hebrews
[12:57] chapter six paul said by two immutable
[13:00] things in which it was impossible for
[13:02] god to lie what two immutable things
[13:04] that god cannot lie and that god made a
[13:07] promise he made a promise to the seed of
[13:10] abraham he made a promise and when god
[13:12] says when god says anything it's going
[13:15] to happen
[13:16] and brother brahma said see where now
[13:18] we're changing we're changing
[13:19] dispensations
[13:21] in other words it's time
[13:23] it's time what is the dispensation a
[13:25] dispensation is a time block this now
[13:27] this time you do god is fulfilling his
[13:30] word in this way to martin luther and
[13:31] there's a dispensation moves on a little
[13:33] bit higher another dispensation is time
[13:36] it's time for this part of the word to
[13:38] be fulfilled and now we're in another
[13:40] dispensation is now it's time for the
[13:43] head to come it's time for the full word
[13:46] to be fulfilled for every promise of god
[13:48] that god for god promised in this age to
[13:51] be fulfilled to us
[13:53] and he said it may seem foreign to us
[13:55] but when we turn right back in the
[13:57] scriptures without even knowing where to
[13:59] look and the holy spirit brings out and
[14:01] just puts the whole word together makes
[14:04] the picture there to show us just the
[14:06] hour that we're living in what hour are
[14:08] we living in it's rapture time
[14:11] it's resurrection time it's time for the
[14:13] dead saints to come from the ground how
[14:15] do we know it's that time because the
[14:16] word has become resurrected in our lives
[14:19] we can see we can see the word being
[14:21] fulfilled in our midst we could you
[14:23] think about backing when brother branham
[14:25] in his day would i listen i got to
[14:27] listening to testimonies on youtube one
[14:29] day and
[14:30] this woman was telling about how she was
[14:32] she was she came into the into the
[14:34] meeting with brother branham and she
[14:35] looked down while she he was praying for
[14:37] her standing up there on the altar and
[14:40] and and she she looked down and she said
[14:42] i saw a wheel in the middle of the wheel
[14:44] there there standing and all those
[14:46] things that happened during his his his
[14:49] as he was bringing that message out we
[14:51] we
[14:52] so many supernatural vindications but
[14:55] now what he preached is becoming real to
[14:58] us it's becoming alive in us
[15:01] now he said he said we're at a corner
[15:03] it's easy when somebody turns a corner
[15:05] of a brick mason turns a corner starts
[15:07] everybody laying their bricks right down
[15:09] the same row like a certain denomination
[15:11] starts it starts rolling down the road
[15:13] right it's all right
[15:14] but when you get to them turns where you
[15:16] have to turn back the other way you
[15:18] realize what he's saying
[15:19] the denominations kind of get stuck on
[15:21] their little their little thing
[15:23] whatever it might be the way to baptize
[15:25] or whatever it is and they start they
[15:27] start laying down that wall but then
[15:29] somebody would come along like martin
[15:31] luther or john wesley it's time to go a
[15:32] little bit different way and then then
[15:35] here comes a prophet that says time to
[15:37] turn a corner turning the corner is when
[15:39] when you think you've got it all figured
[15:41] out and then somebody says well hold on
[15:44] there's more to the puzzle and you begin
[15:46] to turn a corner
[15:48] so many times don't we think we got it
[15:50] all figured out and then you hear a
[15:51] preacher get up behind the pulpit and
[15:53] share a little bit more maybe you didn't
[15:55] hear it a little bit but more
[15:57] you didn't hear before like that there's
[15:59] more to it and it keeps building up
[16:01] building up but we're turning the corner
[16:02] what kind of a corner are we turning
[16:04] we're turning the corner off
[16:06] because he's building he's building a
[16:08] body something where god can tabernacle
[16:10] himself in not just a straight wall but
[16:12] something where god can get in and live
[16:14] in and live through you
[16:16] turn into corners when you tie up all
[16:18] the loose ends all the things you used
[16:20] to hold to that used to be partial or
[16:23] incorrect or or just just going the
[16:25] wrong way or all the water baptism one
[16:27] god no eternal tale those were all all
[16:30] this
[16:31] you can go on a straight line but when
[16:33] you turn comes time to turn a corner
[16:36] each of those things begin to build on
[16:38] one another
[16:39] turning the corner to the headstone
[16:42] we're turning the corner to the seven
[16:43] seals we're turning the corner to christ
[16:45] the mystery of god revealed we're
[16:47] turning the corner to the masterpiece
[16:49] we're turning the corner to the token
[16:51] the true baptism of the holy ghost we're
[16:53] turning the corner to the true
[16:55] revelation of the grace of marriage and
[16:57] divorce
[17:01] brother abraham said in christ is
[17:03] identified the same in all generations
[17:04] he said usually people don't want to
[17:06] believe it because they're already set
[17:07] in their way
[17:08] you're turning a corner
[17:10] you're building a building and then get
[17:12] to the corner everybody's running this
[17:13] way they don't want to turn that corner
[17:16] but the building goes that way if the
[17:18] word says it goes that way
[17:20] see that's where we get those junctions
[17:22] of time that's where it's hard
[17:23] that's where that's where men had to
[17:25] sweat it out
[17:27] when you turn a corner then you get to
[17:28] that's why you had all these back in the
[17:30] back in the early days brother dale and
[17:32] different ones that there was a lot of
[17:34] fighting going on a lot of battling out
[17:36] because you got to sweat it out because
[17:37] you're turning the corner you're there's
[17:39] a change in dispensation you gotta you
[17:41] gotta you're you're struggling to find
[17:43] out what the truth is and that all these
[17:44] things have to be it's there's a lot of
[17:46] fighting out time
[17:48] and he said and who do you say this is
[17:50] he said we're building a building not a
[17:51] wall
[17:52] the builders want to take a line of
[17:54] blocks and just go straight down
[17:57] now any builder can build that but it
[17:58] takes a real master mechanic to turn a
[18:00] corner
[18:01] see when you got to cut the corner take
[18:03] that's the time it takes it shows
[18:05] whether you're you're really a stone
[18:06] mason or not when you can turn the
[18:08] corner with it and keep the continuity
[18:11] of the rest of the building but turn the
[18:13] corner now that's there's the key right
[18:15] there to keep the continuity where
[18:18] everything runs together and fits
[18:20] together but turn the corner
[18:22] to keep the continuity where you can
[18:23] preach daniel's 70 weeks and the
[18:25] masterpiece and the token and christ the
[18:27] mystery of god revealed and all the
[18:29] stature of perfect man and you have
[18:30] continuity through the whole thing and
[18:32] it all fits together the builders want
[18:34] to keep building on down but we're not
[18:36] building a builder but a building we're
[18:38] not building a wall but a building
[18:42] now what happens when you when you when
[18:44] you turn a corner
[18:45] you get all kinds of scoffers arise to
[18:47] say well no it can't be done this way
[18:49] it's not it's not going to happen it's
[18:51] coffers arise just like when when they
[18:53] were building that ezra nehemiah
[18:55] building that wall with with a a a
[18:57] a trowel in one hand and his sword in
[18:59] the other but why why they need that
[19:01] sword because there was a lot of
[19:02] scoffers there's a lot of people to say
[19:04] you shouldn't be building that wall and
[19:06] we're going to prevent you from building
[19:07] that wall and and scoffing there was
[19:09] scoffers and rose when brother brown
[19:11] began to preach those scoffers of rose
[19:13] and john wesley's day i was reading his
[19:15] dire i excerpt from his diary about how
[19:17] when he began to preach he couldn't
[19:18] preach in any church because his message
[19:21] was completely rejected they kicked him
[19:23] out until he had to preach at a field
[19:25] that was the only place he had to preach
[19:28] we believe that there will be a rapture
[19:31] scoffer is going to arise all christians
[19:33] believe that that's bible readers
[19:35] believe that they'll be a rapture
[19:38] now paul paul made a list of scoffers
[19:41] how many like paul's lists paul paul was
[19:43] very fond of list he made a list of
[19:45] things
[19:46] and it makes for very interesting
[19:48] reading in the bible when you go and
[19:49] read his list and now that he listed out
[19:51] all the scoffers
[19:53] in the last days perilous times shall
[19:55] come for men shall be lovers of their
[19:57] own selves covetous boasters proud
[19:59] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[20:01] uh oh disobedient to parents we
[20:06] unthankful
[20:08] unholy
[20:09] without natural affection
[20:12] truce breakers false accusers
[20:13] incontinent fierce despisers of those
[20:16] that are good traitors heavy heady
[20:18] high-minded lovers of pleasures more
[20:20] than lovers of god having a form of
[20:22] godliness but denying the power thereof
[20:24] from turn away scoffers in this end time
[20:27] when a rapture message is trying to be
[20:29] preached people that will arise and say
[20:31] well we got a form of godliness but we
[20:33] we don't want your power the power that
[20:35] we don't want the word that you're
[20:37] you're preaching that will be that will
[20:39] be able to deliver me you realize the
[20:41] word is the only thing that's going to
[20:42] keep the devil out
[20:45] you deny the power the devil's going to
[20:46] have free reign the devil is the devil
[20:49] can't come where the where the word is
[20:51] if you if you get the good man of the
[20:52] house in your soul the devil can't come
[20:54] and sit down
[20:55] the word is the thing that's going to
[20:56] keep him out
[20:58] but we're warned that this doctrine all
[21:00] the doctrines that i'm talking about the
[21:02] doctrines of christ the mystery of god
[21:04] revealed the token those things will be
[21:05] scoffed at
[21:07] and that's the thing
[21:08] that will bring you to a wrap to
[21:10] rapturing faith
[21:11] scoffed at
[21:13] and ii peter says knowing this first
[21:15] there shall come in the last days
[21:16] scoffers
[21:18] walking after their own lust and saying
[21:20] where is the promise of his coming it
[21:22] seems like everybody's been talking
[21:23] about the rapture for a long time it
[21:25] seems like things just keep on going and
[21:27] nothing really nothing is happening
[21:29] people are getting sick people are being
[21:30] buried it just keeps on going and that's
[21:33] exactly what the bible says that they
[21:34] would say
[21:35] saying where is the promise of his
[21:37] coming for since the fathers fell asleep
[21:39] all things continue as they were from
[21:41] the beginning of creation things just
[21:43] keep rolling on the sun sets every day
[21:46] the sun rises the next morning it seems
[21:48] like everything just continues on from
[21:50] creation and nothing's happening because
[21:52] they don't see it
[21:53] i wonder maybe tonight are your eyes
[21:55] open to what's happening do you see the
[21:58] coming of the lord that's happening
[22:00] right now do you see the rap do you
[22:01] realize you could be missing the rapture
[22:04] right now because the rapture the
[22:06] rapture is something that's taking place
[22:08] in you right now
[22:10] it's some it's not going to be like uh
[22:13] somebody that don't know nothing about
[22:14] the message and all of a sudden they
[22:16] hear it and the next day boom they're in
[22:17] the rapture no it's a process that
[22:19] begins something has to be built up
[22:22] within you
[22:23] something that's moving in you right now
[22:26] for this they willingly are ignorant of
[22:29] that by the word of god the heavens were
[22:31] of old and the earth standing out of the
[22:33] water and in the water whereby the world
[22:36] that then was being overflowed with the
[22:37] water perished they're willingly
[22:40] ignorant of the word the thing that will
[22:42] save them
[22:43] like caiaphas scoffing at jesus he
[22:45] didn't know that that the very god that
[22:47] they were singing about
[22:49] my god why is thou forsaking me at the
[22:51] second to psalm 22 he was in there the
[22:53] very god that they were singing about
[22:54] was out there on the cross being
[22:56] crucified right but yet he had an
[22:59] anointing he had all the all the
[23:01] trappings of religion
[23:03] the protestant and catholic church has
[23:05] predicted brother brown said in the last
[23:06] days to be blind the same thing to the
[23:09] scriptures with christ on the outside
[23:11] trying to get in
[23:14] but he said when you see these things
[23:15] begin to happen
[23:17] raise your head up raise up your head
[23:19] get ready
[23:21] something could happen at any time
[23:24] christ come for his church
[23:26] something could come at any time
[23:29] i i want to constantly be looking and
[23:31] expecting how how do you how do you stay
[23:33] prepared by constantly looking in the
[23:35] word and checking checking up with
[23:37] yourself making sure making sure that
[23:40] everything that you're dressed right
[23:41] right making sure that you've got what
[23:43] it takes
[23:46] now see when you when you come to a
[23:48] corner turn the scoffer is going to
[23:50] arise and that gets everybody upset
[23:53] people get upset and that's what the
[23:54] devil likes to do he likes to get people
[23:56] upset
[23:58] he likes to impersonate things and that
[24:02] how does it make people upset it if
[24:03] people begin to look at look at one
[24:05] another and how can how can this message
[24:07] be right with all these people living
[24:09] wrong and people people that i've seen
[24:11] in church for years doing the wrong
[24:13] thing and you begin to look around at
[24:14] other people in the church maybe that
[24:16] that maybe they're not genuine
[24:18] who knows but you know there is a there
[24:20] is a genuine christian
[24:22] there's a genuine christian
[24:24] there's a genuine minister
[24:26] there is a genuine
[24:27] there's a genuine truth of the bible
[24:30] there's a real now the devil wants to
[24:32] impersonate it and get you to looking at
[24:34] the faults and get you all stirred up
[24:35] with the what's faking everything why
[24:37] because we're turning a corner and
[24:39] there's going to be scoffers to rise
[24:41] there's going to be things happen the
[24:43] devil wants to get you all upset and get
[24:45] you looking at the wrong thing there's a
[24:47] genuine truth
[24:49] and there's a genuine rapture
[24:51] there is going to be a rapture
[24:53] but you've got to believe now brother
[24:55] baby said i was reading a paper about
[24:56] two weeks ago in tucson there were some
[24:58] englishmen from england had made a
[25:00] statement that the crucifixion of our
[25:02] lord jesus christ was only fate between
[25:04] pilate and jesus just to make himself
[25:06] something
[25:07] and and and there's no way that we could
[25:09] disprove that to them because all the
[25:11] things of god is to be received by faith
[25:14] you know so many times that's what the
[25:16] believe the sign crowd and all that
[25:17] they're trying to they're trying to
[25:18] prove out things how many people died on
[25:20] the bridge and
[25:21] how they're trying to prove things out
[25:23] by intellectual conception but it's got
[25:25] to all be by faith
[25:27] what's that got to do with the rapture
[25:29] brother bob
[25:30] the rapture is by faith
[25:32] faith is a revelation amen when god
[25:34] gives you a revelation that is faith
[25:38] and he's building you up that's what the
[25:40] word is for the word
[25:42] received in a heart that will open the
[25:44] door to it
[25:46] becomes faith as you receive it it gives
[25:48] you equips you with something and god
[25:50] quickens that and gives you the true
[25:52] interpretation of it
[25:54] putting all the pieces together and then
[25:56] it builds up and builds up within you
[25:59] god is building up something he's making
[26:01] a building
[26:02] brother says we're moving on beyond
[26:04] pentecost the message that went forth in
[26:06] the englishman try to hold that same
[26:08] message for today that won't work today
[26:10] it won't work because of god's building
[26:12] up a building
[26:13] he's building up something
[26:15] and today we our last great reformation
[26:17] was pentecost and today we're moving
[26:19] from that
[26:21] that's that's a a statement that has
[26:24] caused a lot of distress and upset and
[26:26] the message that we're moving beyond
[26:28] pentecost not we're not moving beyond
[26:30] the pentecostal experience
[26:33] back there after right right after jesus
[26:35] down in the upper room we're not moving
[26:37] beyond that we need to be born again but
[26:39] we've got to move beyond that
[26:40] pentecostal denominational idea we're
[26:43] moving beyond that today we're moving
[26:45] from that and the pentecostal message
[26:47] won't mix with this because it's another
[26:49] day it's all the word of god but it's
[26:52] building it's forming a bride for the
[26:54] rapture
[26:56] he said and what was the holy ghost
[26:57] given for now in this age that we're
[27:00] living
[27:00] this age it's beyond pentecost
[27:04] pentecost has settled itself into
[27:06] organizations and started faking a whole
[27:08] lot about organizations started
[27:10] impersonating a whole lot about
[27:11] organizations
[27:13] we are this and we are that a lot of
[27:15] faking going on he said that's just
[27:17] nature you just can't help but it's
[27:19] nature they'll do that it's the plan for
[27:21] them to do that but the church has moved
[27:24] on
[27:25] it's gone into greater more powerful now
[27:28] you think about that it's going into
[27:30] greater
[27:31] more powerful
[27:32] where maybe before there was a lot of
[27:34] jumping around like like i love that
[27:36] illustration that brother brother wade
[27:38] gave of the the bones coming together
[27:40] where
[27:41] when you first start out there's a lot
[27:43] of noise going on but you keep moving on
[27:45] the signals in the flesh coming in
[27:47] coming on towards speaking and and it
[27:49] gets quieter and quieter because some
[27:52] but but they're
[27:54] even though maybe it looks like it's
[27:56] quieter it's getting more powerful more
[27:58] powerful listen you don't have to jump
[28:00] around and shout at the devil to make it
[28:02] move but all you got to do is speak the
[28:04] word give it the word the word is what
[28:06] will make the devil move the word is may
[28:08] what will make your life conform you
[28:10] don't have to jump around and shout and
[28:12] make a lot of noise but the word
[28:15] sometimes in the quiet the quietness is
[28:17] the where the most power is
[28:19] but the church has moved on it's gone
[28:21] into greater more powerful it's the
[28:23] restoration of gifts and many
[28:24] pentecostal people does not believe in
[28:26] divine healing ministry of angels and
[28:29] powers of god
[28:31] because they didn't move on
[28:33] now now what what did brother branham
[28:35] say in
[28:40] the invisible union of the bride of
[28:42] christ he said god let it die
[28:44] because when they didn't move on then
[28:46] god let it die
[28:48] he let it die how how do you want to see
[28:50] the the old you die keep moving on
[28:54] move on and you'll see it die god will
[28:56] let it die you keep moving on he said
[28:58] many pentecostals call these visions
[29:00] that i see the devil
[29:02] think about that the pentecostals that
[29:04] that at one time in their dispensation
[29:06] their little slot of time
[29:08] had the truth but they didn't keep
[29:10] moving on and they called it called the
[29:12] called the word of god the devil many
[29:14] organizations won't even have nothing to
[29:16] do with it in pentecost see we move
[29:18] beyond that
[29:19] just as methodists called pentecostal
[29:21] crazy for speaking in tongues
[29:23] but it's all a coming forth of the holy
[29:25] spirit till the great church is being
[29:28] filled up and chugged full
[29:30] of the great powers of almighty god
[29:33] until it's got to a place until the very
[29:35] works
[29:36] that jesus done has manifested itself
[29:39] right in the church now we're close
[29:42] friends now what does that mean that
[29:44] means that life that that life there
[29:46] you'd see a little spark and and eat as
[29:48] it moved up the stalk moved up that
[29:51] wheat plant a little spark and then it
[29:53] would look like it was dying out as they
[29:54] denominated spark up spark up until
[29:57] finally it got to the wheat germ and
[30:00] when it gets to the wheat germ
[30:02] there ain't no dying out then you die
[30:04] out to yourself as it ripens and you see
[30:06] that life begin to mature in the wheat
[30:08] plant and begins to bow over and humble
[30:10] itself and then you can take that wheat
[30:12] germ and throw it up in the gardener
[30:14] and it ain't gonna rot you can throw it
[30:16] over you can't do that with the with the
[30:18] leaf you can't do that with the root or
[30:21] with all the different other parts of
[30:22] the of the plant you throw it on the
[30:24] ground and it's going to rot it's going
[30:26] to it's going to fade away and nothing
[30:27] but that that's that seed
[30:30] the wheat germ you can throw it over
[30:32] there on uh set it over on on the chair
[30:34] and in the yard wherever in in the
[30:36] garner it's going to keep it's going to
[30:39] keep and that's why it will never
[30:40] denominate because it's back to the
[30:43] original grain you've got the original
[30:45] life there you got something that's
[30:47] eternal there you got the original thing
[30:49] back so now now you see that's what
[30:52] brother ram is talking about that's
[30:53] what's going to bring a rapture when
[30:55] you're back to the original
[30:57] i love how he said filled up and chugged
[30:59] full
[31:00] filled up and choked full of the power
[31:02] of god that's what's in that little
[31:04] wheat that little grain of wheat filled
[31:06] up and choked full
[31:08] now brother ryan said he said just like
[31:10] life going through a stalk of weak it
[31:12] louisa leaves the wheat the whole but
[31:14] the wheat forms itself like the grain of
[31:16] wheat that fell in the ground
[31:19] like the original one and once the
[31:21] original the original is the son of man
[31:24] that walked around doing and performing
[31:26] the will of god he knew who he was
[31:29] he knew what his purpose was
[31:31] he knew what he was supposed to do
[31:34] so when it comes all the way through
[31:36] that through that plant until it comes
[31:38] back to the original back again to what
[31:41] the son of man
[31:43] now see god he said in every a in every
[31:45] age god a lot of believers god allotted
[31:48] his word out to each age and each one of
[31:49] those age has to manifest that and he
[31:52] also ordained men for that age to
[31:54] fulfill that word that means in john
[31:56] wesley's day there were people that were
[31:57] he knew before the foundation of the
[31:59] world they were going to believe john
[32:00] wesley's message
[32:02] when pentecost came he knew that they
[32:04] were going to believe in the restoration
[32:05] of the gifts and you think about that
[32:07] now that god before the foundation of
[32:09] the world knew that you would be sitting
[32:11] in this church he knew that when you
[32:14] picked up a message book that you'd be
[32:16] like this this is the truth
[32:18] he knew that you would do that
[32:20] and he had a preacher there for you he
[32:22] had a messenger there for you to preach
[32:24] the gospel so that you would hear it
[32:26] because he knew you would want it he
[32:28] knew you would believe it
[32:30] every time
[32:31] listen to this every time he lauded his
[32:34] word he lotted a man for it
[32:37] when he lot in moses time he lauded
[32:39] moses to it
[32:40] when he lauded the time for the son of
[32:42] god to be born he allotted him to it
[32:45] every age he's allotted his man four
[32:47] ordained as the bible says
[32:50] god is infinite almighty all-powerful
[32:52] omnipresent omniscient why he knowed all
[32:55] things from the beginning so he knowed
[32:58] he knowed
[33:00] there's nothing out of cater
[33:01] it's just us that thinks it is
[33:04] it's everything you run
[33:06] now if we can have trust that he knows
[33:09] we can have trust we can trust that time
[33:12] is marching on according to his to his
[33:14] great plan
[33:17] he's waiting for the he's waiting for
[33:19] all that are going to receive to be born
[33:21] to come to a place where they can hear
[33:23] he's waiting for for people to get
[33:25] together and have families he's waiting
[33:27] for us to come to a place where where
[33:30] we'll we'll get desperate for the word
[33:32] and we'll start digging in he's waiting
[33:34] for us he's waiting on us he's waiting
[33:37] on us to pack the word in and and
[33:40] and and get to a place where where we're
[33:42] more concerned with the word
[33:44] than we are with money and popularity
[33:47] and work and and and what our boss says
[33:50] and and when we get home we don't sit
[33:52] down and turn on netflix and see what
[33:54] the movie of the week is but we open up
[33:56] our bible and start packing that in he's
[33:59] waiting on that he's waiting on us for
[34:02] the rapture the rapture is in our hands
[34:05] because we've got all the tools we've
[34:07] got everything we need to take a body
[34:08] change we've got a message and there's
[34:10] not going to be another messenger we're
[34:12] at the end of the wheat plant it's time
[34:15] to to to
[34:16] to get an understanding
[34:18] which is why he said look back in his
[34:20] word and see what he's doing
[34:22] look back in his word and see what he's
[34:24] doing then
[34:25] we'll have an understanding
[34:28] that's what the scoffer the scoffers are
[34:30] looking at
[34:31] intellect they're trying to understand
[34:33] through intellect
[34:34] but it's not by intellect it's by
[34:36] revelation
[34:37] by revelation to know that those men
[34:40] those men that
[34:42] back in the early church they they died
[34:44] for something his disciples that they
[34:46] died and martyred them for something
[34:48] they believed in something it wasn't
[34:49] just an intellectual intellectual
[34:51] conception that made peter want to be uh
[34:53] crucified upside down
[34:55] it wasn't just the intellectual
[34:57] conception that andrew made andrea to be
[34:59] crucified on that that x the andrews
[35:01] cross it it wasn't just the intellectual
[35:04] conception that paul paul was willing to
[35:07] have his head severed from his body
[35:09] that's not just an intellectual
[35:10] conception but they believed
[35:12] it wasn't just something that they had
[35:14] in their head
[35:17] that's why we don't we don't believe
[35:18] moses just passed over a sea of reeds
[35:20] and all these things that the scoffers
[35:22] throw out because
[35:24] it's a revelation to know that god's
[35:26] word is true and that these men were
[35:28] fighting and living and dying for
[35:30] something that was real
[35:32] something that they really believed in
[35:35] now see that's what brother branham was
[35:37] getting at when he said the spiritual
[35:39] application the people don't get it well
[35:42] they can listen to the to the message
[35:43] maybe sit in a message church for just a
[35:45] little bit and and it just goes over
[35:47] their head because they're they're
[35:48] listening from an intellectual
[35:50] standpoint instead of waiting for god to
[35:53] bring a spiritual revelation
[35:56] he gave the example of how that that
[35:57] this man this astronaut got in a rocket
[35:59] ship and he flew up he flew up to the to
[36:02] the um
[36:04] i'm trying to remember who it was
[36:06] so i could think what he did
[36:08] he went to outer space and and he said
[36:11] uh
[36:12] he said they thought god he he said
[36:15] here i got the quote here he said i i
[36:16] see no god
[36:18] up here
[36:19] you're a gregarian
[36:21] that that russian astronaut one of the
[36:23] first people that went to space
[36:25] he flew up into space and he said i see
[36:27] no god up there up here and so brother
[36:29] brown said that turned all it shook all
[36:31] these ministers up they because they
[36:33] thought they their intellectual
[36:34] conception was that god was sitting up
[36:36] there but what would he be doing sitting
[36:38] up there and like on the moon with a
[36:40] chair or something or floating around in
[36:42] space but their intellectual conception
[36:44] was that if this scientific astronaut
[36:46] with a lot of education went up in space
[36:49] and said that there's no god up there
[36:50] then oh my
[36:52] out of wonder if there really is a god
[36:54] because they didn't know
[36:56] that god is right here god is nighty
[36:59] even in thy mouth god is living in his
[37:01] people
[37:02] god's not way out there on the other
[37:03] side of the universe he's he's right
[37:05] here with us
[37:06] that's the whole point of in the time of
[37:08] trouble you can trust that god is with
[37:11] you that god is near you he's not going
[37:14] to leave you he's not going to forsake
[37:15] you that's actually a promise in the
[37:17] bible and they didn't they were trying
[37:20] to understand god with their
[37:21] intellectual conception and they failed
[37:23] to see it
[37:25] he said our civilization
[37:27] that's the difference between the head
[37:28] and the heart the head tries to reason
[37:31] it all out and you see you see why he's
[37:33] laying it out you're not going to go in
[37:34] the rapture with an intellectual
[37:36] understanding but it's going to be an
[37:38] understanding from your heart
[37:41] not because you've been schooled you've
[37:42] been to message school but because
[37:45] you've got a relationship with god that
[37:47] you know god for yourself you have a
[37:49] personal relationship with him now he
[37:52] said our civilization that's coming on
[37:53] will have nothing to do with this
[37:55] civilization at all what's the
[37:56] difference this civilization is an
[37:59] intellectual civilization a civilization
[38:02] where you got to go to school to get a
[38:03] job
[38:04] a civilization where your mind is all
[38:07] about your mind you it's all about the
[38:10] things that you know and and those sort
[38:12] of the things that you know by
[38:13] intellectual conception but there's
[38:15] another civilization that's coming that
[38:17] will be from the heart that will be a
[38:20] civilization a supernatural civilization
[38:22] where you don't get sick
[38:24] you don't have to you don't have to
[38:26] labor in the way that we do now it'll be
[38:28] such a higher order of civilization he
[38:31] said there'll be a different
[38:32] civilization into this civilization and
[38:34] this scientific world we got more
[38:36] science scientific we get further we go
[38:38] into death things traps to kill and
[38:40] everything and that new civilization
[38:42] there'll be no death no sickness sorrow
[38:45] or no pain there won't be none in there
[38:48] so this civilization will have to be
[38:50] destroyed
[38:51] because it's of the devil you see why
[38:53] the bible says if you love this world of
[38:55] the things of the world the love of god
[38:57] is not even in you if you look around at
[38:59] this civilization and think this is
[39:01] wonderful this is glorious
[39:03] i heard i heard a minister preaching a
[39:05] while a while back about how that that
[39:08] the things are that you see around you
[39:10] for some will be the closest that they
[39:12] ever get to heaven and for others it
[39:14] will be the closest that they ever get
[39:16] to hell
[39:17] because this is your deciding ground and
[39:19] the great things that you see in this
[39:21] civilization for some will be the great
[39:24] the closest they can get to heaven you
[39:26] go to disney world and see all the palm
[39:28] trees for some that might be the closest
[39:30] they can ever get to what heaven will be
[39:32] like
[39:33] but other others on the other side that
[39:36] all the heartache and despair and seeing
[39:38] your loved ones go into the ground and
[39:40] that will be the closest you'll ever get
[39:43] to hell all the despair and and having
[39:45] to fight for your for for to pay your
[39:48] bills and all that
[39:50] this is the deciding ground
[39:52] we're talking about civilization so
[39:54] we're going to a higher civilization
[39:56] that's not based upon what all your
[39:58] intellectual but based upon a revelation
[40:00] of a living god a revelation to you
[40:04] satan's revelation was in genesis
[40:06] chapter 4 civilizations people started
[40:08] building towns and cities and so forth
[40:10] and instruments of music and becoming
[40:12] science
[40:13] but god's civilization was when seth's
[40:15] people come on they began to come on and
[40:17] call on the name of the lord they wanted
[40:19] to be able to worship god in the right
[40:21] way and sacrifice in the right way and
[40:23] and come to him in the right way so that
[40:25] they could return back to him but
[40:27] satan's civilization will always take
[40:29] you further away from god
[40:30] and all civilization will has got to be
[40:33] judged by something
[40:34] it's got to be judged by some now why
[40:37] when you go read in revelation and it
[40:39] starts talking about the son of man the
[40:40] son of man is the judge
[40:42] why is that
[40:43] because the son of man is the word
[40:45] and all civilization has got to be
[40:47] judged by the word
[40:49] the word is the judge
[40:51] he said all civilization will have to be
[40:53] judged by something we find out in this
[40:54] day when this great scoffing and making
[40:56] fun of the bible and trying to push it
[40:58] out god has got to judge the church
[41:02] by something
[41:03] and the church that's why when you come
[41:05] to church you're seated at the judgment
[41:07] seat of christ because you're being
[41:08] judged you're sitting here and you're
[41:10] suffering judgment now as the word is
[41:12] going over the pulpit whenever we come
[41:13] to church we're being judged am i a
[41:16] christian am i living right do i have
[41:18] the right to take communion it's my life
[41:19] worthy of the gospel and the word's
[41:21] going forth and it's lining you up to
[41:23] see whether or not whether or not you're
[41:26] right
[41:27] because the word
[41:28] is the judge and many times we try to
[41:31] judge one another and we'll point
[41:32] fingers and things with our own
[41:33] intellectual understanding but the word
[41:36] is the thing that judges us
[41:38] he said they can't go down this street
[41:40] and arrest me and say i'm making 30
[41:41] miles an hour and i'm 30 miles on unless
[41:43] there's something there to tell me that
[41:45] i'm i'm only allowed to go 20 miles it
[41:49] has to be there and that's the word
[41:51] god is going to judge the church
[41:54] that's why he said
[41:56] if he judged by the baptist then the
[41:58] methodist would go to hell if he judged
[42:00] by the see how he i don't know how he
[42:02] put that because so many times we want
[42:04] to point the finger and send everybody
[42:05] else to hell but he's judging by the
[42:08] word it's not our own ideas he's judging
[42:10] us by the word
[42:12] if he's going to judge us by the
[42:13] methodist the baptist is lost he judge
[42:15] it by the oneness the two twoness is
[42:17] lost what's he going to judge it by he
[42:19] said he would judge it by christ
[42:21] and christ is the word so it's the word
[42:24] of god that god will judge and the word
[42:27] without we any creeds or dogmas or ideas
[42:30] that's that's the word that's going to
[42:32] judge not not
[42:34] you know
[42:35] martin luther sitting there and
[42:38] preaching preaching the little bit of
[42:39] revelation he had but then tossing out
[42:41] the book of esther in the river
[42:43] and saying well that's not that's not
[42:45] the word of god that that you see
[42:48] the word of god is what he's going to
[42:50] judge by
[42:51] now that martin luther threw the book of
[42:53] esther in the river but he in that day
[42:55] he
[42:56] you see what i'm you see the point i'm
[42:58] getting at it's the word not our little
[42:59] ideas that are mixed in but the word
[43:04] so brother now listen i'm walking you
[43:06] through this this this little study on
[43:08] on the rapture
[43:10] the rapture and he said now during the
[43:11] talking about getting out our little
[43:13] ideas because the word is what's going
[43:14] to judge us and he said during the feast
[43:16] of unleavened bread when they'll kill
[43:18] that sacrificial lamb there was to be no
[43:20] leaven among them through the entire
[43:22] seven days why because because because
[43:24] once the lamb was killed
[43:26] then you got to get all your living out
[43:28] right you got to get it all out
[43:30] so then you come to a place where
[43:32] there's no unbelief
[43:34] everything had to be unleavened that
[43:36] represented the seven church ages that
[43:37] we get in the book here and there's no
[43:40] leaven
[43:41] so down through the seven church ages
[43:42] god is working out all our unbelief by
[43:44] the word amen because the word is what's
[43:46] going to judge us we can't we don't we
[43:48] don't want to hold over if there's a new
[43:50] there's always a new message coming
[43:52] forth down through the seven church ages
[43:54] there's always a new message so you
[43:56] don't hold over from the previous
[43:58] there's a new message coming forth and a
[44:00] new thing
[44:01] a revival goes forth and the first thing
[44:03] you know
[44:04] within about three years they start an
[44:06] organization over
[44:08] he said this has been sweeping for 20
[44:10] years now and there's no organization
[44:12] and there never will be
[44:14] this is the yen
[44:16] the wheat has come back to the wheat
[44:18] again
[44:19] the wheat has come back to its grain
[44:21] the shook has pulled away from it
[44:25] and the wheat must lay in the presence
[44:26] of the sun
[44:28] to be ripened
[44:29] and all the while the church world is
[44:30] scoffing and scoffing and saying you
[44:32] don't know what you're talking about
[44:34] it's not true despite the fact of all
[44:36] the things that that god has has used to
[44:39] vindicate the pillar of fire being
[44:41] visible in pictures and photographs and
[44:43] and pillar fire being visible in
[44:45] meetings and campaigns and all all the
[44:47] things but to the church world scoffs
[44:50] but to the church the bride
[44:52] the rapture is a revelation to her
[44:55] it's revealed to her
[44:57] that the revelation the true bride of
[44:59] christ will be waiting for that
[45:01] revelation
[45:02] of the rapture the rapture is a
[45:04] revelation
[45:07] i'm just i'm just going to slow down and
[45:09] take my time so
[45:11] amen
[45:12] i know sometimes it gets a it'll be a
[45:14] little bit of
[45:16] hard hard to with with it with some
[45:18] meeting meeting us
[45:20] but we'll we'll just we'll just be slow
[45:22] and yeah and take our time tonight
[45:25] now now so the rapture is a revelation
[45:28] now what's the revelation though now in
[45:30] hebrews 11 paul said now faith is the
[45:33] substance
[45:34] of things hoped for the evidence of
[45:36] things not seen so now i'm hoping for a
[45:38] rapture you get to where you're hoping
[45:40] for a rapture but when now when a
[45:41] revelation comes
[45:43] you know that it's it's gonna happen you
[45:45] know that you're you know you're not
[45:47] going in the grave you know that you're
[45:49] going in the rapture not now i'm not
[45:51] talking about you know that you're born
[45:52] again i'm not talking about that you've
[45:54] got confidence in the message i'm
[45:56] talking about that you know that you're
[45:58] going in the rapture
[45:59] that's why it says faith is the
[46:01] substance of things hoped for maybe one
[46:03] time you hoped that you were born again
[46:05] but then faith came and it was the
[46:07] substance of that
[46:09] and what is the substance it's something
[46:10] that's real
[46:12] it's real that even though even though
[46:13] maybe you can't see it yet if you if
[46:16] you're hoping for your healing and then
[46:18] you've got the substance of it even
[46:20] though maybe it's not manifest in your
[46:22] body you've got it because it's the
[46:24] substance so you're not you're not
[46:26] looking for it anymore you got it and
[46:29] now you're just now you just got to go
[46:30] through the motions of walking into it
[46:32] because faith is the substance of things
[46:35] hoped for the evidence of things not
[46:38] seen
[46:38] so christians not looking at things that
[46:40] we can see because if you were you'd
[46:42] look around and you say well
[46:44] like like all the scoffers the scoffers
[46:46] where's the evidence of his coming
[46:48] where's the evidence that it's real but
[46:51] faith is the substance
[46:53] you know that it's true because it's
[46:54] been revealed to you
[46:56] now maybe you know maybe you like like
[46:58] sister shepard kind of wondering if she
[47:00] was really born again but as the world
[47:02] begins to build up and build up build up
[47:04] you come to a place where well
[47:06] something's taken place in my life it
[47:08] comes to a place where all the doubt is
[47:10] moved away and and that's the same thing
[47:12] with the rapture there comes a place as
[47:14] it's built up within you there's going
[47:17] to come to a place
[47:19] somebody told me years ago
[47:21] uh just kind of sharing i i i think it
[47:24] was brother dale
[47:25] that when the seals are opened up to you
[47:27] fully and they're full manifestation
[47:29] when the seals are fully opened up to
[47:31] you you're going in rapture because it's
[47:33] a revelation right now it's it's a it's
[47:36] a revelation you have the substance of
[47:38] that of that thing that you hoped for
[47:40] now you got it and you're not going to
[47:42] die when you got the substance
[47:44] when you got the substance of that thing
[47:46] and he said you cannot have a revelation
[47:48] without it being faith
[47:50] faith is a revelation because it's
[47:51] something revealed to you faith is a
[47:53] revelation
[47:54] amen
[47:56] faith is something that has been
[47:57] revealed to you like it was to abraham
[47:59] that could call anything contrary to
[48:01] what had been revealed to him as though
[48:03] it wasn't so
[48:05] that's what faith is is the revelation
[48:07] of god
[48:08] the church is built upon a revelation
[48:11] the whole entire body
[48:14] now a revelation is not something a
[48:16] minister gives to you
[48:18] that's why jesus told peter fl blessed
[48:20] art thou simon barjona for flesh and
[48:22] blood hath not revealed it unto thee
[48:25] flesh and blood didn't give it to you
[48:27] that's why ministers can't tell somebody
[48:29] i think you're born again
[48:30] because it's got to be something god
[48:32] shows to you i i don't want to tell
[48:35] somebody they're born again or they're
[48:36] not born again
[48:37] let god reveal it to you let god convict
[48:40] you if you're not born again let god
[48:42] reveal it to you if you are born again
[48:44] because it's going to be a revelation
[48:45] all the way i can't tell you you're
[48:46] going to take a rapture but if god tells
[48:49] you that then it's revealed then you've
[48:50] got the substance of it right so then
[48:53] you look now all the secret of all these
[48:55] things is in that final book in the
[48:58] bible the book of revelation the
[49:01] revelation now that book
[49:03] has been sealed for all these years
[49:06] people could look at it and probe and
[49:07] they didn't know what it meant because
[49:09] it's sealed is sealed up just for a
[49:11] special group of people
[49:13] as seal brother brown said the book of
[49:15] revelations is the last book of the
[49:16] bible it's sealed to unbelievers
[49:20] that's why you don't hear you don't hear
[49:21] anybody hardly preaching about it
[49:23] outside of the message because they
[49:24] can't they they can't understand it they
[49:26] read the seven churches they read about
[49:28] the seven seals and and the seven
[49:29] thunders and the seven vials and the
[49:31] seven plagues and it's all a mystery and
[49:33] go on all through the bible the things
[49:35] past the first first first five chapters
[49:38] and my you get into some things that
[49:42] is sealed it's sealed to unbelievers
[49:44] we realized then that it was all
[49:46] together given for believers what was it
[49:48] given to you for
[49:50] for faith
[49:51] to given to given to you for so that you
[49:53] can have faith
[49:55] and and and he said now that book was
[49:57] written but then remember it was sealed
[49:59] with seven seals and these seven seals
[50:01] was not to be opened until the sounding
[50:03] of the last earthly angel on earth
[50:06] revelation 10 7 and in the days of the
[50:09] sounding of the last angel's message
[50:11] seventh angel the mystery of god should
[50:14] be finished in that age
[50:16] and that's the age we're living in
[50:18] so now what's going to give you
[50:19] rapturing faith
[50:21] rapturing faith lies in the message the
[50:24] rapture of faith because rapturing
[50:25] because the message is is giving you the
[50:28] correct interpretation of that book of
[50:30] revelation and in that book of
[50:32] revelation is the mystery of the seven
[50:34] seals
[50:35] and the mystery of the seven seals is
[50:37] the seven thunders because the seven
[50:39] thunders all those mysteries that are
[50:40] contained in the seven seals
[50:44] are y'all still with me
[50:45] [Laughter]
[50:47] i know there's a lot of information
[50:49] y'all hang on just a little bit
[50:55] yeah that's right
[50:56] yeah no just
[50:58] chew the cud
[51:00] sometimes you gotta regurgitate a little
[51:02] bit now on us some more
[51:04] so i'll go slow
[51:06] he said we all know we're living in the
[51:08] layout of sea age
[51:10] there will never be another age to it
[51:12] so we're living in the laodicea age
[51:15] and these seven seals this hail that
[51:17] book is a mystery to people
[51:19] should be open at that day
[51:21] and he said this rapture that we're
[51:23] talking about is only for the bride amen
[51:26] yes sir the seven seals reveals
[51:28] to you it gives you rapture and faith
[51:31] now now this is how brother brown said
[51:33] how the rapture this this is my my notes
[51:35] how the rapture is going to happen he
[51:37] outlines in the middle of this in the
[51:39] middle of this of this sermon how it
[51:41] will happen
[51:42] and and how it will happen
[51:44] you think i'm about to say you'll be
[51:45] walking down the street one day and blah
[51:47] blah blah no no now listen okay he goes
[51:49] back
[51:50] back he said years before you were born
[51:53] you were in a fought your father as a
[51:55] gene
[51:56] through a bedding ground through holy
[51:58] wedlock he becomes in the image of me i
[52:00] know him i can fellowship with him and
[52:01] he come just at the right time when it's
[52:03] the right time
[52:05] now so were you in if you've got eternal
[52:07] life you were in god before there ever
[52:09] was a world
[52:11] you are a part a son of god an attribute
[52:14] of god he knowed the very age you were
[52:16] coming he predestinated you to that age
[52:18] to take that place and no one else can
[52:20] take it care how many impersonations
[52:23] he's and think so he see he's going all
[52:25] the way back to the back before where
[52:27] you were just a thought and he starts
[52:29] bringing it down
[52:30] here it comes here it comes one day one
[52:33] day uh everything was situated right on
[52:35] earth your mom and dad was here and then
[52:37] and and he's bringing it on down you you
[52:39] were born and it comes you you heard the
[52:41] gospel he said he predestinated you to
[52:44] that age you've got to be there because
[52:45] he knew you would be there now you are
[52:48] made manifest now you can fellowship
[52:50] with him and that's what he wants now in
[52:52] the beginning way back way years before
[52:55] there was a time began you if you are a
[52:57] born-again christian tonight you were in
[52:59] god then your father that's why when you
[53:02] come into this life here and profess
[53:03] christianity
[53:05] everything going wrong
[53:07] you've wondered why this is and all this
[53:10] you wandered at it
[53:11] but one day
[53:14] something struck you amen
[53:16] what was it
[53:18] the life that was down in there from the
[53:20] beginning
[53:21] from the beginning the one life the life
[53:23] that god knew the potential that you
[53:26] were born sin and shape of that iniquity
[53:28] but god knew one day
[53:30] one and when you heard the word
[53:32] something sprang forth and he said it
[53:34] was a voice
[53:36] that you realized
[53:38] that that's the thing that fear
[53:41] the voice
[53:42] that's that's the same thing that
[53:44] happens with a with a baby with the mama
[53:46] and daddy get together and and want the
[53:48] cells come together
[53:50] and then one cell adds to the other
[53:52] one on top of the other something begins
[53:54] to form and before long you've got a
[53:56] crying baby and then it keeps continuing
[53:59] it keeps building and building and
[54:00] building until before long you've got an
[54:02] adult man
[54:04] standing there and that's the same
[54:06] that's how the rapture is going to
[54:07] happen
[54:08] that's how it's going to happen he said
[54:10] that's the way every born-again
[54:12] christian when you come i don't care how
[54:15] many denominations you join how many
[54:17] names you put your name on the books and
[54:18] things when that real
[54:20] word of god is vindicated and made true
[54:23] before you like that you realize you're
[54:24] an eagle right there because all this
[54:27] clucking of the hen you join this and
[54:29] join this and go this way and that way
[54:31] it's nonsense
[54:32] it's a genuine
[54:34] adding word
[54:36] to word amen
[54:38] now see then he goes back to a little
[54:40] baby he said when a germ comes into the
[54:42] womb of the female it don't take on it
[54:44] it don't take on cells from a dog or a
[54:46] cat or something it's taken on what its
[54:49] parents are what what it is a human
[54:52] it's taking on human human human say and
[54:55] he's talking about how that when you eat
[54:57] the word you are becoming the word as
[55:00] you eat the word and what you're taking
[55:02] on is what you're feeding on
[55:05] what you're taking on you're actually
[55:07] becoming the word until you become the
[55:10] stature of a perfect man built up in his
[55:13] image he said it was all human germ and
[55:15] the body of jesus christ the bride will
[55:18] be part of his body he was the word and
[55:21] the bride will have to be the word word
[55:23] added to word add to word it's got to be
[55:26] word on top of word
[55:28] germ on top of journal life on top of
[55:30] life to bring out the full stature of
[55:33] the bride of the lord jesus christ
[55:36] it's the word that's doing it it's the
[55:38] word that is changing you it's the word
[55:41] that cast out the devil so you could be
[55:44] missing the rapture even as we speak if
[55:46] the if you're missing the word you
[55:49] people get so worried about missing the
[55:51] rapture as though it's just this one
[55:52] event that just kind of drops down but
[55:54] you could be missing it right now
[55:57] and not realize
[56:00] he said it's god's life it's god's life
[56:03] quickening the word
[56:05] so how do we get into this body by one
[56:07] spirit we're all baptized into the body
[56:10] it's the life
[56:11] the life in that body the spirit that's
[56:14] bringing us all into rapture
[56:17] he said you can never beat nature nature
[56:19] always testifies god runs in continuity
[56:21] with nature it has to look at the trees
[56:23] how they put forth their leaves
[56:24] everything that they do
[56:25] now we find out the leaves drop off the
[56:27] tree go back what the life goes down to
[56:29] the root of the tree is that the end of
[56:31] it
[56:32] comes back next spring with new life
[56:35] now see what now he's talking about the
[56:36] resurrection he's talking about you know
[56:38] you you if you've got eternal life and
[56:41] you go down into the grave you're coming
[56:43] back because you can't keep the holy
[56:45] ghost down
[56:46] you can't keep that life down it's got
[56:48] resurrection power in it so you put you
[56:51] put somebody down in the grave and
[56:52] they're coming back up and you put life
[56:54] and and those that shall remain you put
[56:57] if they've got eternal life you can't
[56:59] keep them down either they're going to
[57:00] be changed
[57:02] and the life that's in them will not
[57:03] prevent those that are asleep
[57:05] because it will be it will match the
[57:07] life of the son of man
[57:09] the word for this day is what's changing
[57:11] us
[57:12] he said the message goes through is
[57:14] heading on up into the wheat that's the
[57:16] reason the wheat come up and brings the
[57:19] whole thing
[57:20] in the rapture up here at the top
[57:23] so how's the rapture going to happen it
[57:25] grows and grows and grows just like just
[57:28] like from from a thought from a thought
[57:30] way back when where you couldn't even
[57:32] see nothing it matured until now there
[57:35] it is in front of you word upon word
[57:38] upon word building up bringing the whole
[57:40] thing in the rapture
[57:43] up here at the top
[57:45] now
[57:47] he said enoch was the seventh from adam
[57:49] and took a rapture
[57:50] the seven church ages in revelation 3
[57:52] and then a door open in heaven the
[57:54] church said and then the seventh angels
[57:56] message while he was making his
[57:57] proclaiming his ministry then when he
[57:59] began to sound forth his ministry see
[58:01] he's talking about
[58:03] he's talking about the the message that
[58:05] he proclaimed is what's going to take us
[58:07] in the rapture
[58:08] jesus when he started out started
[58:10] healing the sick and afflicted oh that's
[58:11] great rabbi he's a prophet everybody
[58:13] wanted him in his church but when he sat
[58:15] down one day and said i and my father
[58:17] are one
[58:18] that was different amen the word come to
[58:21] a place turning a corner coming to a
[58:22] place where where now he started to
[58:25] preach his message
[58:26] that was different he didn't explain it
[58:29] and he didn't have to explain nothing
[58:31] those disciples might not have been able
[58:33] to explain it but they believed it
[58:35] whether they could explain it or not
[58:37] they sat right still
[58:38] and believed it
[58:42] he said when the seventh angel begins to
[58:43] sound the mysteries of god was to be
[58:45] made known right there
[58:47] the mysteries of god what because what's
[58:49] this what's it culminating in it's
[58:50] culminating in the son of man the
[58:52] revelation of the son of man god
[58:54] revealed in flesh again walking in the
[58:56] flesh of his bride
[58:58] and he said now that's the age that
[59:00] we're living in right now
[59:01] the seventh church age it's all to be
[59:04] manifested in the grain of wheat at the
[59:06] end coming back when the son of man
[59:09] begins to reveal himself
[59:11] now he said what is reveal
[59:14] make his revelation of what he is in
[59:16] this day reveal out to the people the
[59:18] word that's made known for the day
[59:21] to reveal out for to the people the word
[59:23] that's made known for the day
[59:25] reveal to the people
[59:27] by the manifestation of holy spirit
[59:29] making that jesus
[59:31] live
[59:32] among us
[59:34] that same jesus
[59:35] that was planted in the ground
[59:37] is now back living in us again
[59:41] here we see it the son of man coming
[59:43] among his people and doing just exactly
[59:46] confirming his message as he said he
[59:48] would do
[59:49] here we find it in this last age now
[59:52] so then he gets to the point of the
[59:54] rapture amen in second or first
[59:56] thessalonians chapter four
[59:59] for this we say unto you by the word of
[1:00:01] the lord that we which are alive and
[1:00:03] remain
[1:00:04] unto the coming of the lord shall not
[1:00:05] prevent them which are asleep
[1:00:08] for the lord himself
[1:00:10] shall descend from heaven
[1:00:12] he's coming down he's coming down to get
[1:00:15] us
[1:00:16] with a shout
[1:00:17] out with the voice of the archangel
[1:00:20] and with the trump of god and the dead
[1:00:22] in christ shall rise first man
[1:00:25] i want people to see this so bad
[1:00:28] amen what this is talking about amen
[1:00:31] then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:00:33] be called up together and and that word
[1:00:36] called up that means
[1:00:37] escape in other words god's gonna snatch
[1:00:40] us out of the trouble called up
[1:00:43] he takes us out we're in trouble and he
[1:00:45] just comes and gets us out of here
[1:00:48] called up together with them in the
[1:00:49] clouds to meet the lord in the air and
[1:00:51] so shall we ever be with the lord
[1:00:53] wherefore comfort one another with these
[1:00:55] words that's a comfort now
[1:00:57] it's a comfort to us that that there's
[1:00:59] an escape out of here and whether you
[1:01:01] die or whether you stay there's a way
[1:01:03] out
[1:01:05] and he said
[1:01:06] three things happened
[1:01:08] the word sarah says here in second
[1:01:10] thessalonians he said second
[1:01:11] thessalonians but first thessalonians
[1:01:13] that there is three things
[1:01:15] a shout now what's the message what's
[1:01:17] the now now if you
[1:01:19] there's patterns all the way through the
[1:01:20] scripture patterns now if you can follow
[1:01:22] the pattern then you'll see you'll see
[1:01:24] something
[1:01:25] i'm not going to take too much longer so
[1:01:27] don't get nervous that i'm going to be
[1:01:28] keep it till till nine o'clock or
[1:01:30] anything just hang on with me just a
[1:01:31] little bit longer but a shout is the
[1:01:34] message going first forth first
[1:01:36] the living bread of life bringing forth
[1:01:39] the bride a shout goes forth first and
[1:01:42] then something else has to happen amen
[1:01:44] something else has to happen
[1:01:46] now he told my god uses that spirit of
[1:01:48] elijah five times and laying out the
[1:01:51] foundation of the prophet had to come
[1:01:53] and and when the ecclesiastical group
[1:01:55] would get everything all mixed up he
[1:01:56] would send a prophet raise him up from
[1:01:58] nowhere he belonged to none of their
[1:02:00] situations and speak his word a prophet
[1:02:03] that would speak his word that's the
[1:02:04] shout out a message the shout he said
[1:02:08] nobody set before prophet because he was
[1:02:10] absolutely the word of god he was that
[1:02:12] word in his day you seen god reflect now
[1:02:15] god has promised to send us that again
[1:02:17] in the last days to bring the bride out
[1:02:20] of that ecclesiastical mess and the only
[1:02:22] way it can be done
[1:02:24] and when the shout went forth it
[1:02:26] announced it because the bible says at
[1:02:28] midnight there was a cry made
[1:02:31] and what was that cry
[1:02:33] go go out to meet the bride group
[1:02:35] because it's time for a marriage
[1:02:37] that the invisible union of the bride of
[1:02:39] christ is time for a marriage so make
[1:02:41] sure that your lamps are trimmed what's
[1:02:43] the lamp what's lamp trimming time lamp
[1:02:44] trimming is to make sure that your light
[1:02:46] is glowing as bright as possible make
[1:02:49] sure that you actually got oil in your
[1:02:51] lamp because the lamp trimmers that that
[1:02:53] worked on boats on ships they would go
[1:02:55] and they would fill up the lamps with
[1:02:57] oil
[1:02:57] and make sure there was oil in there and
[1:02:59] then they would trim off the burnt end
[1:03:01] of the of the of the of the wick
[1:03:03] so that you wouldn't get all this smoke
[1:03:05] and everything they would make sure that
[1:03:06] it was burning real bright
[1:03:08] so when you when you hear the shout go
[1:03:11] forth you want to make sure that you're
[1:03:13] listening to that word to that message
[1:03:15] you get into christ there's not a word
[1:03:17] written he said if you're in christ
[1:03:19] there's not a word written in here but
[1:03:20] what you believe it
[1:03:22] because you're trimming your lamps you
[1:03:24] want to make sure that you're right
[1:03:29] it's the whole point that he's trying to
[1:03:30] make is
[1:03:32] the main heart of it
[1:03:33] is the message
[1:03:35] there's what it is what comes from it
[1:03:37] here he said when i went forth into the
[1:03:39] meetings with you praying for the sick
[1:03:40] it was fine
[1:03:41] now this is his words but when i come
[1:03:44] with a message
[1:03:45] the message
[1:03:47] he's trying to get the favor of the
[1:03:49] people so they'll sit and listen to him
[1:03:50] he's trying to get the favor through all
[1:03:52] the the prayer lines and all of the
[1:03:54] discernment and all that trying to get
[1:03:56] people to just sit and listen to him to
[1:03:59] listen to what he has to say
[1:04:01] now you if you really learn how to study
[1:04:03] the message i believe we study the
[1:04:05] message in this church to really sit and
[1:04:07] listen is not having it playing in the
[1:04:09] background while you're doing something
[1:04:11] else but to actually just sit there and
[1:04:14] listen to what he's saying when he says
[1:04:16] when he says in the seventh seal now
[1:04:18] last night something opened up and
[1:04:20] something opened up today go back and
[1:04:22] listen to what he said in the sixth seal
[1:04:24] he said something opened up last night
[1:04:26] go back and listen take notes and
[1:04:29] highlight things if he said something
[1:04:31] opened up today think about what that is
[1:04:33] that opened up today and think and
[1:04:35] meditate on it amen
[1:04:37] he's trying to get the favor of the
[1:04:39] people so they'll sit and listen to him
[1:04:40] why because the word preached
[1:04:43] is what's changing our bodies
[1:04:45] the word is what's closing the gaps in
[1:04:48] our understanding the word is what's
[1:04:50] coming together to give us power the
[1:04:53] word is producing a bride that won't be
[1:04:55] one word off
[1:04:58] some of the grain wheat fell on ground
[1:04:59] the birds picked it up and others fell
[1:05:01] among thorns the bible says and some was
[1:05:03] went on prepare ground pre-prepared
[1:05:05] ground and brought forth i'm going to
[1:05:08] say it like this brought forth
[1:05:10] the voice
[1:05:11] brought forth now now see listen you
[1:05:14] it's almost like
[1:05:15] it's almost like you got you've got two
[1:05:17] messages
[1:05:18] when the angel came to gabriel and said
[1:05:20] you're going to have a child you're
[1:05:22] going to have a child then brother brown
[1:05:24] preached that message why it had to be
[1:05:26] shepherds
[1:05:27] then there had to be shepherds there
[1:05:29] to announce the birth there had to be
[1:05:31] shepherds there to come and see that he
[1:05:34] was born and now see it's almost like
[1:05:36] two messages there was a message that
[1:05:38] went out he's coming
[1:05:39] and then a message
[1:05:41] that somebody caught the revelation of
[1:05:43] it to proclaim that he's here
[1:05:47] and that's the voice
[1:05:49] that he's here
[1:05:50] whose voice is it the son of man
[1:05:53] and the voice of the son of man
[1:05:54] proclaims that he's here
[1:05:57] so when you catch the shout there's got
[1:05:59] to be a shout but when you catch what
[1:06:01] that shout is it becomes real to you
[1:06:04] it's manifested in your life then the
[1:06:07] preachers can preach a different way
[1:06:09] because now they're preaching that it's
[1:06:11] not something that we're looking for
[1:06:13] it's not something way off but he's here
[1:06:16] and they're preaching so just like john
[1:06:18] when in in the book of revelation when
[1:06:20] he took the book and the bible says in
[1:06:23] that chapter
[1:06:24] that it must be prophesied again it's
[1:06:26] got to be spoken again what now now what
[1:06:29] are you speaking again you're speaking
[1:06:31] the same thing
[1:06:32] but now it's a present tense reality
[1:06:35] that that thing that was introduced is
[1:06:37] now here
[1:06:39] the voice now it's the first thing is
[1:06:40] the sounding shout a messenger getting
[1:06:42] the people ready the second is a voice
[1:06:45] of the resurrection that resurrection
[1:06:47] voice the same voice that a loud voice
[1:06:50] in saint john
[1:06:51] that lazarus from the great the voice of
[1:06:54] the son of man the son of man is the
[1:06:55] resurrection sign the one because he's
[1:06:58] the fullness of the word he's able to
[1:07:01] get the bodies from the ground to rise
[1:07:04] the dead from the ground the
[1:07:05] resurrection of the dead a resurrection
[1:07:08] of the sleeping bride and brother brown
[1:07:09] said we're right there ready now
[1:07:12] the only thing the church coming out has
[1:07:15] got to lay before the sun to ripen what
[1:07:18] happens when you're ripening of that
[1:07:20] life is coming forth the life is being
[1:07:22] expressed until until it's not just
[1:07:25] something that you've heard about
[1:07:27] but it's something it's a real
[1:07:29] revelation the life of the son of man
[1:07:32] expressed in you
[1:07:33] he said i've always preached that he was
[1:07:36] deity not just a man he was god
[1:07:38] manifested in the flesh
[1:07:40] god the attribute of god of love the
[1:07:42] greatness see what he's talking about
[1:07:44] the son of man
[1:07:45] displayed here on earth of god jesus was
[1:07:48] god's love which built a body that
[1:07:50] jehovah himself lived in he was the
[1:07:53] fullness of the godhead bodily what god
[1:07:56] was he manifested through that body
[1:07:58] that body had to die so he could wash
[1:08:00] the bride with his blood not only is the
[1:08:02] bride washed forgiven now see that body
[1:08:05] died so he could wash
[1:08:08] this body so that he could watch the
[1:08:10] bride with his blood
[1:08:12] you see what he's talking about the
[1:08:14] voice but he begins to start talking
[1:08:16] about the bride he begins to talk about
[1:08:18] he said now the bride is
[1:08:20] washed forgiven she's not only washed
[1:08:22] forgiven but she is justified
[1:08:25] how she justified because the word has
[1:08:28] washed her and cleansed her and made her
[1:08:30] to a place where now she's matching what
[1:08:32] god wanted her to be she's born of his
[1:08:35] bone and flesh of his flesh life of his
[1:08:38] life
[1:08:39] the same thing you see what now you can
[1:08:42] proclaim the voice is proclaiming that
[1:08:44] that thing that life that was prophesied
[1:08:48] of now is here
[1:08:49] now it's here it's not something that
[1:08:51] we're hoping for but now we've got the
[1:08:53] substance of that thing maybe even
[1:08:55] though you can't see a lot of shouting
[1:08:57] and jumping around but yet in the
[1:08:59] quietness and stillness of a perfect
[1:09:01] revelation
[1:09:03] that life is here
[1:09:05] the son of man is here
[1:09:08] he said the blood of jesus christ
[1:09:10] cleanses us so from sin until it's put
[1:09:13] in the book of god's forgiveness he's
[1:09:15] the only one can do it amen we can't
[1:09:18] we can forgive but not forget right
[1:09:20] i could forgive you but i always
[1:09:22] remember you done these evil things
[1:09:25] then you're not just you're forgiven
[1:09:27] but in the sight of god the bride is
[1:09:29] justified
[1:09:31] she never done it in the first place
[1:09:35] standing there married
[1:09:37] to the virtuous son of god she's married
[1:09:40] to him now
[1:09:42] never sinned in the first place
[1:09:44] when she heard the truth and come forth
[1:09:46] the blood cleansed her and she stands
[1:09:48] there virtuous see she no sin on her
[1:09:52] at all
[1:09:54] therefore the message calls the bride
[1:09:56] together see the shout
[1:09:58] and what what is the voice brother ryan
[1:10:00] said in in the patmos vision way back in
[1:10:02] 1960 he said what is his voice it's the
[1:10:05] judgment the voice of the ministers
[1:10:08] through the holy spirit that's crying
[1:10:09] out to the people in every age standing
[1:10:11] there the voice of many waters cried out
[1:10:14] thickness and multitudes the voice of
[1:10:16] those seven stars in his hand to every
[1:10:18] church age preaching the baptism in the
[1:10:20] holy ghost the baptism in jesus name
[1:10:23] speaking in tongues the power of god the
[1:10:25] resurrection of christ the second coming
[1:10:27] divine judgment
[1:10:29] the voice of many waters came forth from
[1:10:31] this one that looked like the son of man
[1:10:34] many waters
[1:10:36] his voice
[1:10:37] he said in the voice of the sign there
[1:10:39] has to be human flesh on earth to speak
[1:10:41] his voice
[1:10:42] i am the vine you are the branches
[1:10:44] there's no way of getting around it
[1:10:45] friends that's just scripture it's the
[1:10:47] truth
[1:10:49] the spoken word the spoken word is the
[1:10:52] original seed and the word has got to be
[1:10:55] spoken
[1:10:56] the word has got to be spoken out now
[1:10:58] you see you see if you can look at this
[1:11:00] pattern
[1:11:01] there's the trumpet
[1:11:03] there's got to be something between that
[1:11:04] shout out between the shout and the
[1:11:07] trumpet which is the voice and brother i
[1:11:09] said the trumpet with the sound of a
[1:11:10] trumpet and when it does it caused
[1:11:12] always a trumpet called israel to the
[1:11:14] feast of the trumpets calling israel to
[1:11:17] the feast of the trumpets so between the
[1:11:20] shout between this message going out and
[1:11:23] between the israel coming back and
[1:11:25] beginning to get a revelation of who
[1:11:27] they are and what christ did for them
[1:11:29] between that span
[1:11:32] there's going to be a bride that
[1:11:33] realizes who she is
[1:11:35] there's going to be a bride to come to
[1:11:37] the fullness of the revelation
[1:11:41] i'm trying to find a place to close here
[1:11:44] he said we've had three witnesses
[1:11:46] three is a witness
[1:11:49] the bible says in matthew 18 16 if he
[1:11:51] will if he will not hear thee and take
[1:11:53] with thee one or two more that in the
[1:11:54] mouth of two or three witnesses every
[1:11:56] word may be established
[1:11:58] and there was three raptures in the old
[1:11:59] testament as a witness that the rapture
[1:12:02] is coming because god promised it
[1:12:04] enoch was one elijah was the other one
[1:12:07] how did enoch take a rapture brother
[1:12:09] brown preached about how the enoch he
[1:12:11] said i did everything that you told me
[1:12:13] to do now you can apply that to your own
[1:12:15] life i was born again
[1:12:17] because you told me i needed to do it i
[1:12:19] climbed up the statue of a perfect man
[1:12:22] because you said these virtues are
[1:12:23] required i come to the capstone because
[1:12:25] it was promised for this age you've come
[1:12:28] because and you've done just like enoch
[1:12:30] did i've done everything that you told
[1:12:32] me to do elijah was the other one jesus
[1:12:34] was the other one he said the word of
[1:12:37] the lord came to enoch
[1:12:39] the word of the lord that's how you go
[1:12:41] in the rapture the word of the lord came
[1:12:43] to elijah his prophet
[1:12:45] and the word of the lord was jesus
[1:12:49] now there's three raptures in the new
[1:12:51] testament the old testament saints the
[1:12:53] bride and the two witnesses
[1:12:55] and and jesus when when he was there on
[1:12:57] the cross i'm going to kind of hurry
[1:12:58] through this part he said when he cried
[1:13:00] again with a loud voice there's that
[1:13:02] voice again as he cried on the cross and
[1:13:04] the old testament saints rose up from
[1:13:06] the grave and they walked around in
[1:13:07] jerusalem and and people began to
[1:13:09] recognize him he said because of that
[1:13:11] voice there on the cross as he died he
[1:13:13] cried with a loud voice his loud voice
[1:13:16] awakened the old testament saints just
[1:13:18] exactly like the loud voice awakened
[1:13:20] lies were see the loud voice awakened
[1:13:23] they had offered the sacrifice to lamb
[1:13:26] and when he died and yielded up the
[1:13:27] ghost he screamed with a loud voice and
[1:13:29] the old testament saints awoke
[1:13:32] watch the shout and the voice over here
[1:13:34] the same thing
[1:13:36] that is coming
[1:13:37] there's a voice
[1:13:39] that will wake the sleeping saints
[1:13:42] what is that voice the life of christ
[1:13:45] revealed in his people being preached
[1:13:47] the way he wanted it to be preached
[1:13:50] being lived lived voices lived out and
[1:13:53] you and i and it's got to draw the
[1:13:55] sleeping dead from the ground
[1:13:59] and in first thessalonians for this we
[1:14:01] say unto you the scripture that we're
[1:14:02] preaching on that we which are alive and
[1:14:04] remain under the coming of the lord
[1:14:06] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[1:14:08] for the lord himself shall descend from
[1:14:11] heaven with a shall that's the second
[1:14:12] rapture and in revelation 11 and they
[1:14:15] heard a great voice from heaven the two
[1:14:16] witnesses they heard a great voice from
[1:14:18] heaven saying unto them come up heather
[1:14:20] and they ascended up to heaven in a
[1:14:22] cloud and their enemies beheld him what
[1:14:24] is it in all these cases it's the word
[1:14:27] of god the word of god received by these
[1:14:30] people and received to a place where
[1:14:32] they were called up
[1:14:34] he said the third one is the two
[1:14:35] witnesses of revelation 11.
[1:14:40] in first thessalonians then we which are
[1:14:41] alive and remain shall be called up
[1:14:44] and that word in the greek means to take
[1:14:46] by force to pl pull to seize claim for
[1:14:50] oneself equally snatch out or away you
[1:14:54] think about god wanting to just claim us
[1:14:56] all at once
[1:14:58] to snatch us away
[1:15:00] and he said now now the musicians can go
[1:15:01] ahead and come we'll close on this he
[1:15:03] said now we're ready
[1:15:05] now we're ready
[1:15:06] we're ready waiting for the raptures
[1:15:09] the rapture of the saints
[1:15:11] it's been spoken
[1:15:13] and so shall it be
[1:15:15] when god says anything
[1:15:17] all heaven and earth will pass away
[1:15:20] but that word will never fail you think
[1:15:23] about way back then he said now we're
[1:15:25] ready
[1:15:26] and and now i believe we can read that
[1:15:28] we can read with that with the correct
[1:15:30] interpretation of the message the
[1:15:32] correct understanding of what we're
[1:15:34] doing here and read that and i believe
[1:15:36] we can truly say now we're ready
[1:15:39] do you believe that with me tonight
[1:15:41] let's let's stand to our feet and just
