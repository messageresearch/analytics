look forward to this this service ever every month just seeing all the young people get their singing it and do it I appreciate it brother dick is so good to see you a sister Gail god bless you like the young people were singing about I pledge allegiance to the land but with all my heart with all that hymn that with all I am and that's how we should be doing it right not halfway I think so many today that we pledge you know we kind of give give things a little bit halfway kind of withhold a little bit but we should be given everything that we have to this gospel so this more this afternoon I want to talk about a little topic called just the gospel call which is on my something been on my heart this week and and we'll start off by reading Joshua chapter 23 and then we'll go to Joshua chapter 24 just the first eight verses from Joshua chapter 23 and then Joshua chapter 24 but before we do that let's just go to the Lord in prayer Lord God I'm so grateful Lord to be able to come together and look into your word once again look into the mirror of your word and find out what our we're living in and where we stand Lord Jesus and Lord God Lord it's such a privilege to be able to find out whether there be any fault in us or not or whether we're holding upright with the word Lord Jesus Lord God I pray Lord that you'll help us Lord Jesus and you're just quick in the word to us Lord God to be able to realize where we stand this evening Lord Jesus and I pray oh god it's your spirit Lord we'll move up over this congregation Lord Jesus as we invite you Lord to come in and dwell with us and worship with us Lord Jesus and make this not just a gathering together Lord but a real worship service Lord Jesus because that's what I believe that the bride and this day has Lord Jesus she's got a real move of the Holy Spirit move in our Lord Jesus moving in the Church of the Living God to make us something that maybe the world the world doesn't know anything about Lord Lord we ask Lord Jesus that you'll just take the preeminence of this service Lord God and open up the word though our hearts speak to us Lord Jesus in a way maybe that just idiot man couldn't Lord God but we know Lord Jesus said the father draws Lord Jesus and I know Lord God that you'll draw during this service Lord Jesus that's what I'm expecting Lord I come expecting that this won't be just any old any regular church service Lord but they didn't you'll make it something special we ask it and believe in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen Joshua chapter 23 verses 1 to 8 Joshua said and it came to Kent came to pass a long time after that the Lord had given a rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about that joshua waxed old and stricken in age and joshua called for all israel and for their elders and for their heads and for the judges and for their officers and said unto them i am old and stricken in age in other words he's calling all the young folks to gather around to hear a little bit of wisdom from an old person that had been through some men through some trials if you remember when he went when they got called out of out of egypt Joshua and Caleb were the only ones to live to see this this this part of the journey so Joshua's he's old and he's been through some stuff and he wants to impart a little bit of wisdom to the young folks and you have seen all that the Lord your God has done into all these nations because of you for the Lord your God is he that has fought for you see there's another thing people think that we're just fighting where it is fighting out these battles ourselves maybe the young people the old ones everybody thinks that you got a struggle in your life that you're gonna be the one to deliver yourself but Joshua said no it wasn't it wasn't us it wasn't by our by our own doings it was by the Lord that fought for us and he said behold I have divided unto you by a lot these nations that remain to be an inheritance for your tribes from Jordan with all the nations that I have cut off even unto the Great Sea westward in other words he had placed him into their inheritance exactly according to the way that God had thought of it before and in his mind in his prime they haven't been put into the promised land exactly the way that God had Ford ordained even to the way that when they were born their mama cried out a word of prophecy exhorting how that they would be placed exactly where they would go and he's telling them something he's like Luke you look you're now in the promised land and the Lord your God he shall expel them from before you and drive them out of your sight and ye shall possess their land as the Lord your God hath promised unto you be therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses that you turned out a side there from there from to the right hand or to the left be very courageous to keep every commandment everything that the Lord God has told you to do don't turn to the right hander to the left that you come not among these nations these that remain among you neither make a mention they make mention of the name of their gods no calls to swear by them neither serve them know about yourselves unto them but cleave unto the Lord your God as you have done unto this day now cleave don't mean just to just to you know go to church and just kind of get around it a little bit but cleave me it's like to be vulcanized to it clean means to like that remember that one of David's mighty man that grabbed up the sword and he went to fight and until the sword his hand clove to the sword he couldn't let go of the sword because he had fought so valiantly and that's what that's what I believe that he met with cleave he means grab ahold of God with all the sinew and don't let go now let's go over to Joshua chapter 24 verse 14 to 15 he says he continues on after you've been exhorting I mean he says now therefore fear the Lord and serve Him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your father's served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and serve you the Lord and if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom he will serve whether the gods which your father's served that whether on the other side of the flood or the gods that they amber ice and whose land you to hell but that's from me and my house we will serve the Lord you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the working in the word when I when I started preaching I one of the these older ministers that pastored another church he told me you know that's where that's where Minister starts is as for me and my house we will serve the Lord when you when you make a make a make a choice when you make a choosing that your house is going to be the ones that that is set apart that is that you have made it a choice in your mind that your house is going to be one that serves the Lord that all the people that live in your house are going to abide by a set of rules that come straight from the Word of God then that's where that's where a Christian life really starts hey you know I maybe I just want to preach on start preaching from this verse you choose you this day whom you will serve because you know every believers got to come to a place every person brother Branham taught us comes to a place where you have a choice sit before you can choose either right or you can choose role you can choose like the amorite religion it's a Moabite religion you can choose like the bedlamite religion that had been presented in front of them or you can choose the way of the Lord you have a right that you have a you you have a these two choices set in front of you and you have to make a choice and nobody can put that force you to make that choice it's all up to you your mama and your daddy can't make you can't force you to make the choice your pastor can't force you to make the choice it's a choice that you are though you are the only one that can make and you know I believe that everybody everybody that comes to church they want to make a choice they might want to make let's put it like this they want to make a stand they want to stand for one thing under another they want to they want to stand for what's true what's right and I believe that Joshua was well-acquainted with taking a stand and that's why he began to exhort all the all the young people that were gathered around him about making a stand because you see he had lived through some things where he had seen people make a stand and he had seen people not make a stand and so he had come through a place where he knew he knew the consequences of not making a stand if you remember when Moses went down into into Egypt he'd make he made us stand by himself and he made a stand not just upon some intellectual intellectual conception of God calling him but he made us stand because he hadn't met God and a burning bush and he knew who it was that came and talked to him and he went down failure and he said like like our pastor is always told of some failure I said who's coming to deliver Israel who's coming to deliver these Israelites and and and and Moses answered back I am because he had a personal revelation that God had given to him and he took a stand and I believe Joshua remembered as he was speaking to all these young people he remembered all these times that somebody had taken a stand as Joshua went out of the children went out with all of the children of Israel has he journeyed with Moses he remembered how all the people began to complain about bread they began to complain about bread coming down from God out of heaven you know what Jesus was on earth he said I am that bread that comes down from God out of heaven and the people began to complain about it because he didn't come in the way that they wanted it to and you see people even today in the message around on Facebook and wherever complaining about the revelation of this hour they don't want revelation anymore they don't work the Word of God in this hour they'd rather have somebody telling them all about how to live and how to be a good little person and how to be a good moral person but I believe that what you need in this hour is the revelation of the hour the revelation of God that he has given us you know you can get you can get in your head where you start complaining about coming to church you can start complaining about well I don't want to it seems so bored and everything it seems it seems like it's just the same thing rehash it over and over I've heard that sermon preached before but you know that's the same thing that the children of Israel did they began to complain about that bread that God has sent them down from heaven to feed them on the journey and that was exactly what they had need of I believe it's time to take a stand in this hour take a stand for revelation take a stand for the word of God that God has given it to us because this is the only thing that's going to take this out of here that's the only thing to combat the devil in this hour it's the only thing that can give you delivering power in your life delivering power over the things of this world it's the only thing that can give you overcoming power and that's what I take a stand for you know Joshua when he came to Kadesh Barnea and he saw he saw all the other Israelites began to not take a stand they failed to take a stand there when when God was able to deliver them from the Giants and and they came to that place y'all scuse me they came to that place there at credence barn the other great the great juncture time the great standoff where only two brother I'm talking about one in a million he began to explain how very very few would go all the way to a real true birth very very feud and compared it to Enoch and Noah and he compared it to Joshua Caleb they're two out of out of millions that came out of Egypt just two two were the only ones that stood there that took a stand there were only two that we're willing to take a stand in that hour you look around and you begin to wonder maybe could it be like that in this day maybe could it be like that were so many people come to church but so many so few people are willing to take a stand for the gospel willing to take a stand and say I believe that God is able to deliver everything every promise of God he's able to able to manifest every single Word of God that he's put made ready for this day now you see you see how dangerous it is do not take a stand do not stick us to take a stand for truth because every one of them died in the wilderness that we're unwilling to take a stand and so when Joshua will begin to talk to all these all these young people those were the offspring of the ones that had died in the wilderness because they were not willing to take a stand at Kadesh Barnea and then just as they were about to cross over so many didn't take a stand against the doctrine of Balaam which was we're all the same we're all the same there's no difference and you could see that even in the message play out today everybody people begin to be deceived and think that everybody's preaching the same thing when everybody is not preaching the same thing we are not all the same God God is God as a separator he is a segregationist because he takes he takes the righteous and moves them just like he took the children of Israel and move them down into Goshen he separated them through the from the evil he separated himself from the things of the world he separated him away and died the doctrine of balaam was that we're all the same let's just blend it all together you can marry a Moabite you could marry an unbeliever and they just tried that he tried to blend it all together until the children of Israel got sidetracked from that and instead of taking a stand for the word of God they failed to the deception of Satan's lie so you see how important it is to take a stand it's important to choose God's Word choose you this day whom you will serve God places it before us he gives us a choice whether we would choose him whether we choose his word or whether we'll just choose our own ideas whether we'll listen to the preaching of the gospel or where we'll just go home and try to figure it out on our own listen see Joshua was speaking to he was speaking we'll say he's speaking to a young generation hey you know III agree with the saying you know that the young people are the that they're gonna be if the old people it's all the older ones if they if they go by the grave and think if they don't continue on that the younger the all these young people are gonna be the next generation all these young people are gonna carry this gospel on but you know that the problem almost I have was saying look it's looking to the future and I want to look to today because I believe that the young people that are sitting here in this congregation or the generation that is going to see the dead and the dead in Christ rise from the ground I believe it you know if we keep putting it off putting it our believes that you are the generation I'm speaking to the young people the old people I believe that you are the generation that will not forgive it that will not prevent the dead in Christ from rising to the ground you are the ones because I believe that you are predestinated to stand and that's what I wouldn't identify you tonight I want to declare to you that you are predestinated to stand in this hour and the way that you're going to stand is because you were going to receive the word you're going to I've received the word for this hour you are receiving it that's why you're here because something is it there's a desire and you to hear and receive the word there's a desire in you to serve the word there's a desire you just stand for the word and that's what's going to cause the word to be made manifest in this a listen this is the our work this Laodicean our where you know every nobody wants to stand for anything everybody everybody just wants to believe whatever they want to believe and you know I believe you know young people old people everybody can get kind of caught up in that mentality that that whatever I think is what goes hey you know you can you so people began to start thinking I you know this is what I stand for and it creates arguments in the home and everything with where the parents may be beginning to try to lay down the law and lay down standards and everything and the young people not being born again yet yet kind of struggling in their own ideas struggling in their own mind saying well this this is what I stand for I stand for being able to do you notice his sleep late I was thinking about how brother branham he began he was talking about how he was struggling with Billy Paul when he was a young man he was saying Billy Paul why can't why can't you get up earlier before noon why can't you get up early before noon I you know brother Lewis was kind of preaching on that this morning he was touching on that how about if you consider it in you consider an ant how are the ant constantly Labor's all the insects think that you can go outside and see that the honeybee that's constantly laboring if you didn't labor it won't have food in the winter if Anne doesn't labor it won't have food and if you don't if you don't leave or you won't be able to provide for your family and you begin to think well what I stand for is just being able to do whatever I want how I stand for just being able to sleep till noon I stand for being up but you know what that's that's actually contrary to the Word of God you know you see you see what a danger it is to be able to hold up as the measuring stick for your prosperity for your success the measuring stick of your own life your own life is not the measuring stick like it's aruba but that built that temple the rouble built the temple with a measuring stick of god's word he held up the measuring stick and measured that said if it's not according to God's Word then we got to stop it we got to tear it down we got to rebuild it again and so when you you come to church to hold your life up against the measuring stick the mirror of God's Word and over time you begin to you begin to come more and more like the word that you're looking at in the Bible because you're becoming more and more like what you're being measured against but it's not yourself that you're being measured against you say well you know what I don't really see anything wrong with the way that that that that people say that we should be dressing I don't really see anything wrong with dressing in this particular way but God's Word says something different God's Word tells you how to dress how to line up with the measuring stick God's Word tells you how how that you know that you should not be corrupting your body you should not be smoking and chewing tobacco and all those different things kind of things why because it destroys your body it's destroying you and so listen I'm talking about taking a stand this morning you say why are you brother Bob why are you kind of hitting on o all those things is that really from the Word of God smoking and drinking and and the way to dress and all those things if I could turn over to 2nd Timothy chapter 3 first one to 6 where Paul's instructed Timothy like Josh was instructing all the young people he said this know also other than the last days perilous times shall come I believe that we're in the last days don't you for men shall be lovers of their own selves lovers of their own selves in other words just saying well whatever I want to do is the right way to do I don't really care about what the word says I don't really care about what the Bible says I don't really care about what the preacher says you know what all I care is about what makes me happy because if it makes me feel good if it makes me happy then that should be something that's all right and that's what they're measuring stick is and I hope that's not your measuring stick this evening covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to Paris did you know even that being disobedient to parents is in the Bible disobedient to parents when you've got real godly a gril godly mother and father that's trying to raise you up and in your mind you think that you know better I listen I listen I'm gonna listen just speak frankly I wonder sometimes if the young people really know how much they owe the older ones love them how I've seen people around this church the older was weeping and sobbing because they're concerned about their young people they won't they young people to be saved I wonder if the young people really realize what a burden that is on the people's heart for you to be saved I wonder if you realize with what agony of what grieving the people are calling out to God in the middle of the night on the night bed crying at night for you to be saved I want to just call your attention to that see one day one day I believe the young people many young people will turn around and like I did I've no idea to turn around the baby I wish I hadn't acted like that when I was young I wish I hadn't acted all silly and everything like that disrespectful unthankful and holy Paul says without natural affection trucebreakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away denying the power thereof what kind of power is there in the gospel that's the kind of power that can take you from loving yourself and loving your brother and sister that's the kind of power that can take you from being subservient says the things of the world they're giving you power over the world there's a kind of power that can give you power over that devil that you struggled with all your life and you could turn around and see it washed away in the sea of forgetfulness washed away in that red sea just like all the Egyptians that were destroyed as the Israelites crossed over that's the kind of power I'm talking about for this sort of thing which creep in their houses and leave captives silly women laden with sins led away with divers lusts ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth first I'm talking about a power that could make you not be ashamed of the way that your mama has a bun I commit a kind of power that could make you not be ashamed of your mama wearing a long dress gonna make you not be ashamed of the way that Christians around you talking acting things I'm talking about a power where you know that God is real and God is alive today because he's living in his church he's living in his people and he can live in you too listen we we try to we get to a place where we think well I like this particular kind of music and therefore it must be right but God can change your desire for music a desire cut from a kind of music that glorifies the flesh that glorifies the person that glorifies the creation and turns your desire to a kind of music that glorifies the creator yes he can heaven and earth will pass away but you you know the music the music CDs and all the iPods and all that would return to dust all this beauty of movie stars and everything will they don't doubt is beginning to sag and droop but satisfying the flesh will lead you down a road that you don't want to go when you become a prisoner to the devil but the power of the gospel can take you to a life eternal that never passes away that never dies it never goes away if by faith Moses brother Branham said but you got to choose you've got to choose and don't look at what you see choose what you see by faith that's the only thing that will count is what you choose my faith a lot as he had to make a choice Abraham give a lot his choice and God gives you your choice choose you this day whom serve in the Garden of Eden there was a tree of knowledge in the tree of life man was given the privilege to choose either one he desired and so is it today you're given your privilege as free moral agents to choose whatever you want to choose now I say tonight choose the based upon God's Word how will you know the right way to choose if you don't know God's Word if God's Word says don't do it then don't do it if God says do it didn't do it if God's will listen if God's Word says to come to church that you should be at church every see every single time the doors open and that's something we struggle with we say well what will my family think my family might be offended if I don't come to church listen the three Hebrew children did not care about anybody else being offended when they said we will not bow down to the image that you have erected up to the prophet of our day because remember that brother brother said that image that was erected that was not the image of Daniel the image to the prophet of their day they would not bow down to it and when they said maybe when they're saying in this they bow down to the image that has been erected to the prophet of our day do you care what other people think do you care what your family thinks when you say I will not back because listen whenever you make a stand it always causes conflicts conflict whenever you make a stand when a father makes us stand in his home it'll cause conflict a lot of times it causes conflict and until you know people begin to wonder well why why is it suddenly when a man gets saved when a woman can say why is it suddenly wrong for you to do this why is it suddenly wrong for there to be mixed bathing why is it suddenly wrong for you to dress in this particular way why is it certainly wrong for this and that and the other and it causes conflict because Jesus said in Matthew chapter 10 I think not that I am come to send peace on earth I came not to send peace but a sword I think sometimes we forget that but for I've come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother as a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law the other man's foes shall be they of his own household but I don't want that I want there to be peace and everything and what that means is that you're not willing to take a stand you're not willing to take a stand for the gospel now you know sometimes we think well what what the young people can't make a stand if their parents haven't been living right I remember the story in the Bible of Josiah who was crowned when he I believe he was about eight years old and his father had been living wrong his father had been living evil but when he was crowned they put that crown upon little Josiah's head he began to say he put he began to possess that it's harder desire to live true to God and begin to tear down all the altars that they had erected to bail he began to tear down everything that they had erected and I believe a young person in this day in this hour when they hear the truth coming across the pulpit they can go home and they could take their Danny's pornographic magazines throw them out of the house they could take the all the filth that their mama's been living all that all that makeup and everything that's thrown out of the house when you hear the gospel for yourself you can live it whether or not whether or not it may be anybody else has even been living around you because it's a personal experience you've got to choose for yourself you've got to be the one choosing you've got to choose right in Rome now I'm a flip-flop I'm a bear so hang on cuz it's not really you that doesn't use it you do the accepted right listen I was talking to talking to my kids after they get back from camps and things and I'm not bashing this so this is a problem all across life not just two camps but you see all these little girls they won't they won't they won't to be the one to choose a boy and then go taking this cell phone they go run it all over the place take my number call me get my Instagram or whatever and you see that's backwards that's that listen if nobody else has never told you that before I'm telling you I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna preach it because listen listen demand is the one that chooses the man and the gospel is the one that chooses ya even in the gospel the people are always running people just like Adam in the garden he was the one running and the man Christ Jesus was the one that chose Christ Jesus is the one that came running after him he was choosing him he wanted him he was looking at his character he was looking I won't you look that's the way a man that's the way any man wants to choose a bride that's the way any man a real man wants to choose a wife he's looking for character he's looking for his ain't not looking for just some kind of some kind of shapely something that can walk in a particular way to satisfy the lust of the flesh he's not looking for somebody to just take us on her on her high-heeled shoes going this way and that but he's looking for character and that's the same thing that God is looking for and you he's looking for character why do you think that I has you eros chose ester when she presented herself without any costly apparel without all pearls and all kind of dolled up with makeup and everything but he said I see and you something priceless I see a real character at you and that's why she was chosen to be his queen God is the one that does the choosing God is the one that does the choosing you see he's the one that's knocking at the door of your heart and listen you either you either accept or reject you are the one that says yes I'll open it up or I will shut the door you that accepts the one that is choosing the one that is choosing you and we'll get to how he chooses in a minute because you're chosen in him you've been chosen in him before the foundation of the world but I just want to talk about another example in the Bible remember when when when Isaac began Isaac the man and he began to won't I need a wife and so this story is very very different than the way that it normally works he says somebody else son look like somebody else to go find him or wife he said Eliezer the the messenger look just like the Prophet in this thing you didn't hear it straight from Jesus's Christ Jesus Christ lips you heard it from a prophet messengers lips just like Rebecca heard it from eleazar's lips but you can see how even in this situation as Eliezer went up to well how am I gonna find a wife for my for my master how am I gonna fight you can see the Spirit of the Living God moving upon the scene and that's it this is what I want to get to tonight it's God's Spirit drawing you listen a man can get up behind a pulpit and preach a good sermon but unless God comes and draws and yet speaks to your heart you'll just sit there like a rock along you'll just sit there like a toady frog you won't make more one move but when God begins to speak to your heart something's got to happen and you can see let's go to Genesis chapter 24 as Eliezer will begin to begin to cry out to God he said behold I stand here by the will of water in that interesting that Jesus so so many women in the Bible met the Savior in a well of water i standing here by the whale of water and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water and let it come to pass that the damsel to whom I shall say let down that pitcher I praise thee that I may drink and she shall say drink and I will give that camels drink also let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac and thereby shall I know that thou has showed kindness unto my master and it came to pass before he had done speaking before he had done speaking the Holy Spirit was already working on the scene the Holy Spirit was already moving on her moving on this predestinated it Brian of Isaac to come and fulfill prophecy you say brother Bob what's that got to do with your sermon I believe that the Holy Spirit is moving in this congregation right now moving to fulfill prophecy you are you are fulfilling a vision you are in a vision right now you are fulfilling the Word of God right now because I believe that God that same spirit that moved on Rebekah I believe that that same spirit is right now in this building speaking to your heart moving upon your subconscious moving upon your secret desires causing you to realize speaking back that that is the truth that's nothing but the truth behold Rebekah came out who was born to Bethel well son of Milcah the wife of Nahor Abraham's brother with her picture upon her shoulder and the damsel was very fair to look upon a virgin neither had any man known her and she went down to the well and filled her pitcher and came up and the servant ran to meet her and said let me I pray thee drink a little water of that picture but she said drink my lord and she hasted and let down her pitcher upon her hand and gave him drink and when she had doesn't giving him drink I wonder if he was sitting there thinking well what's gonna happen next with the rest of my petition be fulfilled even in my sight well the rest of it be be made manifest as she then she said I will draw water for thy camels also until they have done drinking and I know it's been Illustrated many times how much the camel drinks do you see how how amazing this was for her to say I will water your camels also because a camel you don't just give it a glass of water you just don't just even pull up one bucketful well this is a very thirsty camel make drink up to 32 gallons of water in 13 minutes another and think about that long line of camels in other words this was something miraculous still was taking place this was something amazing that was taking place he didn't just ask for some little piddly thing like like listen a lot of the young people today they want to put all their marriage on some of the penalty things that they know I had this little piddly dream I had this little something and you don't base anything upon the Word of God you don't you don't go back to the word to see whether or not you should be getting married or not but I said I've had that thrown up in my face I know a lot of you my testimony how I did have a dream before I saw my wife I saw my wife in a dream but I'm not saying that to make anything of myself I'm saying it to lay that beggar but to put the record straight because I did not go to my wife and say listen I had a dream now you got to marry me let's enough dangle that dream all in her face like that listen I had a dream see how spiritual I am look at this I believe that God can direct your path but he don't direct your path so that you can go manipulate somebody like that he don't go do that so that you can just dangle it in front of about somebody so you could say show how spiritual is how great you are listen there is a real true call of God in people's life there is reals a real move of the Holy Spirit in God's life and if God really does show you by revelation who you should marry then you hang on to that and hold it down in your heart and do like Eleazar and said if it is true that God will bring it to pass and if it is not true then maybe God maybe God didn't show me that think of it that way but listen I've seen so many so many situations I would listen I was talking to a pastor of another church I would just put this out there and he said he said I've had so many men come up to my daughters and say God showed me in a dream that I should be marrying Yuni and he asked one of them how many other girls did you tell that to and he said seven seven that you told that God had spoke to you and told you to marry marry my daughter listen oh I we made you a bunch of foolishness there's so much foolishness going on I would encourage you to be wise in the gospel be wise as a serpent and harmless as a dove but gird up your loins to know whether what's truth and what's a lie listen I just got coming to where listen if nobody else was saying I'm fixin to just lay it out there I believe that you need to sit down with your kids and lay it out there so that they know what's truth and what's right lay it out there so they're not let astray by all kinds of gobbledygook could all kind of nonsense all kind of Filth and perversion to people some some young man that's not even filled with the Holy Ghost all these goddamn is there is some lustful spirit comes sniffing around your girls and everything and wounded wanting to come up and egg listen it's time it's time to be real I mean it's time to be real it's time to stand for something it's time to stand for truth it's time to stand for something that's real in this hour look see see how it's saying it earlier only you cut to it's time for you to take a stand it's time and you can't make the right stand without God moving on you moving on you two to do that I think so many times you know it frustrates those parents and everything will well we started fussing and everything about why you listen to that music why are you doing such a thing why do you not understand why you should not dress this particular way you don't understand all these things but you cannot understand unless it's revealed because it's sovereignly revealed you cannot understand unless the Spirit of God comes and speaks to you and that's why in John chapter 6 245 it says no man could come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day it is written in the prophets and they shall be all taught of God of God every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the Father cometh unto me every man that has heard and learned of the Father cometh unto me and you know I think sometimes we get a sinner in our head when we when we read this scripture that no man could come to me except the father that's it which has sent me draw him though no man can come we look at that as a negative thing no man well I may as well not even try no man can come but do you all I want to flip that around and look at it real positive this evening because that means that no man can come unless the father draws him then that means that when the preacher gets I'm about behind the pulpit and something goes the word in your heart when you hear going in the mall berry bush that's not because of the preacher that's going you but that's because of a living God that speaking to your heart I want to identify that for you tonight that when the preaching goes forth and something in your heart says that's the truth the truth open up the door of your heart that's the living God moving upon the moving upon your heart I wonder all of you older ones that have been born again if you could look back this morning and remember when God first began to draw at your heart I remember when he first began to draw at mine hey listen how I grew up in a message home I grew up on Cigna I said it a message home I we had tapes playing all the time I remember I remember when my dad will go out and get the tape boxes that were shipped every once a month or however often there were and with joy and he would open up the tape and put the tape in and and open up the books and sit there reading for hours but do you think I did do you think I wanted to do that no because the father had not drawn me yet and I would sit there at when we went over long car rides and my parents would constantly be playing the tapes we would have devotionals every night in my home my parents was sit around and talk to us and read stories from the Bible and explain to us every single night and that's one thing where I would like to growing up as I've called it finally kind of falling short to be honest but my dad did it every single night when we were on vacation when we were at my grandma's house every single night he was constantly having devotionals but do you think I ran headlong after the gospel not until the father drawled me but one day I was walking with my dad as we went after after church we were walking down this disa through the wheat fields as they were growing I believe it was a wheat I was some kind of crop and even getting to talk about the future home of the heavenly bride and the heavenly bridegroom in the earthly bride and began to talk about that and and and it wasn't just the words that he said but something began to speak down on the inside of my heart and when I got home I could not put down the tapes I could not put it down I ran headlong to the message I was talking to another brother years ago he was testifying of how when he heard that call he said I read the entire Bible in a weekend the entire Bible in a weekend listen that's that's that's running like a large after a half serious the entire Bible from cover to cover why because something that got ahold of him and it wasn't just to preach it from behind the pulpit but it was a living God and that's what I want to get to you tonight is that there is a living God movie there are angels and kept around the palace that you can't see there's a living God speaking to your heart right now and he's calling from an unseen realm he's calling you to look look past the things that you see look past the things that your two eyes could behold and look past look to see what God has waiting for you he's calling he's drawing you see because that's how that's how he's done everywhere remember Paul in the Bible Paul ran he thought that he thought he was doing the right thing by running after Steven and killing him by persecuting Christians by running a throw up but then one day and listen to how it has worded in Acts chapter 2 verse 36 2/3 I'm sorry I snapped ur 9 and he said in Acts chapter 9 verse 4 and he said he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto Him Saul Saul why persecutest thou me and he said 'who out the art that Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecute us it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks it's the heart for thee to kiss kick against the pricks who are you who is pricking him who was prick and Paul was it wasn't it Steven so much when he saw him dying there no it was it was a spirit of a living God speaking to his heart cricketing but listen what they said on the day of Pentecost in Acts chapter 2 verse 36 and 37 therefore I Peter said therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom ye have crucified both Lord and Christ now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and brethren what shall we do and wrought while all around about him all the Pharisees and Sadducees were standing there or I don't see nothing special about this but they were pricked in their heart why because the father had spoken to them it was God on the inside calling to them God revealed that there's something real about this when they begin to realize that these are these men are drunken with wine there's some kind of supernatural stimulation there's something supernatural going on and God spoke down on the inside of their heart this is true this is real where is he calling from he called he called Saul by name Saul Saul why persecutest thou me saw saw do you know what he's calling you by name tonight he's calling you by name because when you when you hear that gospel call and buy the gospel call I'm not just talking about a preacher from behind the pulpit but I'm talking about the Spirit of God calling your name he's calling from eternity because he knew why he knew you before the foundation of the world he knew you he saw you he knew that you would be sitting in this service tonight he knew whether you would be asleep or whether you would be awake he knew whether your ears will be open he knew whether you would be receptive he knew whether you would want it or not and so it was predestinated into him before the foundation of the world and that's how you were chosen in him you were chosen in him he chose Christ Jesus and because you were in him before the foundation of the world he also chose you you were chosen in him well how were you chosen in him because in John chapter 12 32 is has an eye if I be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me o men what kind of meal in Genesis chapter 1 26 27 that said God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and you were there back then you were there as an attribute back then and he new you you were predestinated into him before the foundation of the world so that when he died on the cross he could look forward in time and know that one day you would receive it like he prayed for you in John chapter 17 like who in John chapter 12 it says if I be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me and now he's drawing you you that were predestinated to hear this gospel before the foundation of the world he's drawing you to himself he's drawing you back to the eternal and how is he drawing because when you hear the preaching of the gospel then and the preaching of the gospel is true when truth is preached because the Spirit of God can hover over that word hover over you and say and point back to that and say that's the truth brother Branham it will be his head the response would be just as simple as just raising your hand will you raise your hand all the people in the congregation that he brother Branham would be talking to stand up from your seat raise your hand all of those things because listen see how you cannot raise your hand without something spiritual taking place why because Ezekiel chapter Ezekiel chapter I believe it's 30 36 says that you've got a stony heart he's got to soften up your heart so that he can he's got to soften up your heart by the revealing of the word without a soft heart you just sit there all stony-faced like like like a little toady froggy gonna leave you just sit there staring at the preacher but when God begins to move upon you like he moved upon the water in Genesis when he moved upon the water and calls that see that predestinated see that had been laying there brother I said from another civilization an eternal civilization when that Spirit of God began to move upon that seed the seed came up and that's what he's doing now he's moving upon that a predestinate his seed in your life and he's gonna cause it to come up he's calling it he come up from the mud and the muck and the mire until there's a birth that takes place because what Ephesians chapter 1 verse 4 says according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good place his will he's chosen us in him my that should make every believer so happy today that should make every believer so happy to realize that God has spoken to you on a one-to-one basis he came down he saw so much of you hey valued you so much that he sent his spirit into the church so that he could speak to you so that he could commend you you know they were talking about that young man that just killed himself up there I III I wonder you you you want to just get across to all the young people all the people in the world if you could realize with what value you have the value your soul is worth ten billion trillion world's your soul is worth that much to God and God is worth so much that he came down and died for you and died for you so that he could send his spirit back on the day of Pentecost and speak to you in communion with you on a one-to-one basis that's how much God cares for you but you see with the devil the devil tries to get in there and tell people that they're worthless and they don't have any value and and all that kind of things someone all kind of discord like that all brothers and sisters constantly tell they tell your children constantly tell you young people how much you love them be salty to be so salty to them that will make them thirsty be salty to one another that will though don't let the salt lose its savor be so salty and sweet and wonderful and kind to one another that'll make everybody just long to be a Christian everybody long to have what you got that's that's my prayer for myself you know I know many times I've fallen I've failed I failed of that I've failed as a father so many times but listen the mistakes that we made many times we make mistakes raising our children many times we make mistakes but there is a God that can come upon the scene just like Josiah that was raised wrong and he can patch everything up and make all things new he can he can straighten everything up maybe sometimes it's good for the for the young people to see mistakes in our lives to realize that there's no good at us just because people people think with a you're a minister you must be all perfect and everything listen ministers have more problems than anybody else because the devil won't save more problems but the devil's got all of his guns trained on you to constantly hinder you you can't study or things I'm talking about it but Meyer you hear about all these pastures are all around that the devil will try to attack their kids and get them running off to get married and all these kind of things listen we should be praying one for another praying one for another diligently I don't know why I got off on that but anyway listen let's just it's been 45 minutes so I'm trying to come to a close here you think about all the ones in the scripture that that didn't know hardly anything about the gospel and maybe their hearts were cold but then God came on the scene to begin speaking down on the inside of there speaking to them revealing himself to them calling them just like little merry little 16 year old Mary one day she was walking just to do about her own business and an angel came to deliver her a message that and he began to expound to her about how Isaiah Isaiah had prophesied that the Virgin shall conceive and she said well how is this going to be and he said well well the Holy Ghost is gonna come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God see she heard a message she heard the message from the angel but you see it takes the Spirit of God to come and speak to you it takes the Spirit of God to come and quicken it without the spirit I was talking about in Sunday school this morning without the Holy Ghost where this is just a gathering without the Holy Ghost and many times you can you can begin to just look at the natural and you begin to lose sight that there is a Holy Ghost moving in the church maybe maybe sometimes many ministers as they stand from behind the pulpit you begin to look out to people as Louise was was expanding this morning and see people seem like they're not desperate anymore their eyes are have clothes that can barely stay awake and it seems like they don't even really want it anymore is there a hunger for the gospel anymore and you begin to end the natural and the natural you begin to think well maybe nothing's going on but realize that that God that Hebrews 13:8 says that he's the same yesterday today and forever and that God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob is still moving in his people he's still working he's still doing things he's still calling his people they see you see it's not the preacher going you though it's not the preacher it's the Holy Ghost that's doing the drawing remember in 1st Samuel chapter 2 it says talking about how that that little Samuel lay in there at night when the Spirit of God came and began to minister to him and it says an air the lamp of God went out in the temple of the Lord where the Ark of God was the same it was laid down to sleep that the Lord called Samuel and he answered here am I and you see what Samuel thought it was he thought he thought it was the priest he thought it was the priests dog and that's what I want to call to your attention identify when you when you get a little idea something begins to stir down on the inside of your heart that's that's God speaking to you and the only thing for you to do is just quickly run and respond and he ran into Eli instead hear him I for that cost me and he said I called not lie down again and he went and lay down and the Lord called in again Samuel as Samuel arose and went to Eli and said here am I for thou call us me and he answered I call not my son lie down again now Samuel did not yet know the Lord just like so many of us the first time we heard God so maybe we need a little bit of extra destruction and maybe that's why I'm preaching this tonight to identify the Holy Ghost calling you when the Holy Ghost is speaking to you that's the Holy Ghost revealing to you trying to come in and knock it on the door of your heart neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed unto you and the Lord called Samuel again the third time and he arose and went to Eli and said here am I for thou just call me and and Eli perceived that the Lord had called the child because you see it's the Lord calling you may the conference with God in 1960 brother have said talk it over with him tonight friend just a few words will mean so much let's bow our heads just a moment now I'd like for each one of you to think in your heart am i worth anything sure you are God loves you look what he came for you oh how do I know he will receive you the very thought of you recognizing that you're wrong is the fact that Christ is dealing with you he said no man could have come to me except my father draws him first that shows that God's right near you drawing you he wants to hold a little conference with you there in your seat or standing around in the aisle in the wall or outside leaning against the building or out in your cars the Holy Spirit oh I know as sin was simple I've heard that before you but it's the truth he wants to hold a little conference with you now and just talk it over with you I wonder if you've ever ever had a little conference with God before I think that's one thing that may be so like it in so many of our lives I'll tell you that's one thing that's been lacking in my life because you get so concerned with all the things around you get so concerned with your job or how long it takes to get to work and everything that you forget to commune with God and forget that he's drawing you but listen you know you know that's why people people get in their hand well this church brother Dale and brother waiting there by their there it gets altar calls there gets people coming up and giving their life to the Lord no nobody's not against giving their life to the Lord nobody's against the altars against altar calls if it's the man drawing you if it's the man saying come up trying to pluck away at your emotions and things which well what what don't you think you saw your brother or your sister come up the other day or whatever it might be well don't you think you ought to come up now too and you see what it ends up doing is it doesn't do anything people get this misconceived notion of what what it really is to come to the Lord they think they begin to think like Samuel did that it was the priests draw on them instead of waiting on waiting on God to do the drawing but you see we believe in altars we believe we believe like Abel back in the with brother I'm explaining here he put himself on that altar with his sacrifice and identified himself with that lamb that he offered up he put himself on that altar and he died himself and I believe it or died out whether it's in your car whether it's in the yeah on the bus to work whether it's whether is in your pew at church I believe in a diet out but it's got to be God that does the drawing you remember how brother Brandon begins to he kind of got on one of his Deacons when when he went up there brother Billy Paul after Billy Paul had gone through all that trial or gambling and all that all the different things that he got up got involved with and he can win up and kind of tapped him on the shoulder don't you think it's time don't you think you need to be up there at the altar when that when the Spirit of the Lord was moving and brother Branham came by later and he said you can't do that you can't just you can't you can't force anybody in any way because then it's the priest then it's the person then it's the man it can't be the man it's got to be God doing the drawing because then when it's God doing the drawing it's something real it's something real like we were talking this morning about it and in Sunday school what yes any school what is the Holy Ghost the real baptism of the Holy Ghost is a personal revelation of Jesus Christ personal to you and that is the calling of God that is the drawing of God God revealing himself to you he reveals himself to you that he has justified you he reveals that you need something's wrong in your life he reveals that you need to be sanctified and he reveals to you that you can be sanctified and you began to feast on the word and you begin to eat the word and he begins to reveal it to you and till it pushes out and pushes out but it's not the man behind the pulpit and it's not your mama and daddy it's God doing the drawing it's God doing the revealing and then it becomes something real you see then it becomes something somebody nobody can take away from you because it's God on the inside doing the work you see psalm 42 7 says deep brother brahma used to always reach on this so many times deep calling earth under deep with the noise of thought water spouse all of our waves and thy billows are going over me you ever you ever experienced that when you just get in the presence of the lord so much until he's just wafting over you and he's speaking to you and communing with you and you know what it means to have a deep calling to your deep a deep the soul of god in communion with your soul something something draw and you something speaking to you something and you know what that does it puts you it puts you into a state of desperation cuz listen I'll be closing on this in a minute let me just bear with me just a moment cuz I got to get this out y'all when God begins to speak to you when God began to speak to me as I was walking with my dad they put me into a state of desperation that there's something out there that I don't have that I need there's an made me thirsty it made me realize what that thirst was awful all of a sudden and the only way to quench that thirst was to get into the word to get into fellowship with God to pray and seek Him to long for him to get into communion with him it made me desperate and listen you're gonna see you can preach a sermon about you need to be desperate you need to be desperate and you do need to be desperate but it's only God that can make you desperate but when God begins to draw a tomb against the pool at you it's time to let go and get it get real it's time to give give over to that desperation because brother Branham taught us that when when you begin to get desperate that's when things happen something begins to take place when you when you begin to get desperate you know I'm not your brother Bob was talking about getting the new birth no I'm talking about this whole journey when you begin to see the Statue of a perfect man and you realize that there's something like it in your life something more beyond is something greater than just a new birth then I believe it should create a desperation and you if that's really God calling you and that's really God drawing you and not just somebody drawing it out on the whiteboard not just somebody explaining it to you so you say well good I've got that now from an intellectual standpoint I've got a good laid out for me but when God does the draw and when God begins to reveal himself for you it puts you into desperation why because you're desperate for the word brother Burroughs said in desperation she said you can't be desperate til God speaks to you Oh Church rise and shake yourself pits your conscience wake yourself up in this hour we must be desperate or perish there is coming forth something from the Lord I know it as thus saith the Lord there is coming forth something and we better get desperate that's between life and death it'll pass through us and we won't see it you know I believe maybe sometimes it kind of hinders people when when ministers get to preaching about desperation it kind of oh well don't you think I'm desperate enough for whatever don't you think maybe you don't see the way that I pray and agonize that many times we don't but I believe many times preachers are like Joshua and Caleb when they begin to stand up there as they saw the people unwilling to make a stand and what do they do they begin to wring their clothes and I believe that's what the Ministry of the gospel around the message is doing in this hour is that written in their clothes and desperation it's time to get desperate it's time to pay take a body change do you think you'll take a body change without getting desperate do you think you'll take your body change with just going along haphazardly like brother Lewis was preaching this morning yeah listen listen that was a masterpiece this morning that he preached because he was talking about the lackadaisical layout of seeing spirit that grabs a hold of so many and you just go floating away down the river floating away without getting desperate but I believe that gospel was sin in this day to make you desperate to realize that something's gotta take place you gotta be like that little chicken hatching out at the edge like a little ego I had will say eagle brother Bret told the story about the little chick hatching the other egg but I'm gonna say Eagle Eagle hatching out of the egg then it's it's desperate to break through it's desperate to get through that thing and he said that little that little Eagle and a little chicken whatever it is it's labeled and it's pushing trying to get through and you know what you can't help it you can't help it because it'll kill it what is it what does he mean by you can't help it you can't do it for it you can't do it for your kids you can lay it in front of them you can lay the gospel in front of them just like the ministering of the Gospels laying it in front of the people but I can't make anybody live the gospel like you've heard the story that's saying about you can put lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink you can lay the gospel in front of somebody but it's only God that can draw them to it it's only god that can draw them to make it to drink and listen your God is drawing you through a process and you're laboring to bring forth life laboring like remember the story of Hana shall she began to cry she didn't have a son she wanted to see that promised son come forth he wanted to see a child come forth and she began to call out for God when they went when her husband went down to do his beauty as a priest she went into the temple and lay there before the altar and she forget to call out to God why because there was something that she knew she didn't have and she needed and I believe that's how every every young person every old person in this in the entire world and that in this church today should be you should realize if there's something that you don't have call out to God until God comes upon the scene and delivers that son into you everybody all right brother ever said in birth pains he said Lily he said considering how it grows toils has to bring herself up this little pond Lily where it where it come through dirt look mud muddy waters dirty waters it pressed its way through all of that this little germ of life working itself from the bottom of the pond where the frogs and things are at and then brings yourself up through all of that but when it gets in the presence of the Sun it's born the little seed bursts open into life it cannot do that until it goes through all that process it's got to come through there that's what makes it is because the discern itself is what's drawing the Sun itself it's what's drawing the life in that seed and when it gets fully above all the dirty waters and muck and so forth then it's so happy it just gives its life out freely and it's a beautiful life when it gets to the presence in the presence of that which is drawing it up I think that's a beautiful type of Christian life with something that's drawing you out of the world until one day you're born right into its presence by the Holy Spirit how beautiful if you try to help it you kill it like a little chicken when it's being born you know if you'd ever noticed one of the little fellers ride on top of his little beak already bird that's born from an egg it's got its maturing this Oh egg shell the old inner parts of the eggs has to rot away and it has to take this little beak and scrape back and forth until it breaks to shell out we call it peeping its way out down in Kentucky where I come from peeping his way out they have never found a better way see you try to help him you'll kill him pick the shell off of him he'll die see he's got to labor strain break forth you see that's what's happening in the church now is that the church is laboring breaking forth laboring to bring forth the promised son and many many in this church are at different stages of labor some are laboring to just push through that through that little that first was a layer of dirt into the Sun and some are laboring to push forth and bring forth that adopted son that adopted child that birth of the Son of Man different ones at different stages of labor but we're all laboring but I want to encourage you tonight I see that's what makes it so difficult to preach I can't make anybody desperate but yet I'm gonna be I'm gonna preach desperation you must be desperate you must be desperate in this hour now is the hour of desperation I see I'm so tired of hearing excuses well we can't get desperate into your persecution combs I believe that if you get along with God a little bit if you'll get into the world and begin to just look into the mirror of God's Word long enough it'll create a desperate longing in you to see God's Word fulfilled in you I believe that I believe that that's what that's what the message of the hour calls for desperate if and if not why did brother Branham preach desperation why did he preach birth pains I believe that it calls for something else other than just kind of coming along coasting alone coming to church just kind of being lackadaisical and that's why that's why in the book of Revelation it says he'll spew out of his mouth if you're neither hot nor cold just kind of lukewarm just lukewarm enough to just well I kinda I'm here I'm kind of doing it I know about the message so I must believe it but get into the message until it becomes a living reality to you listen I'm telling about my personal I told you about how when I when the Lord began to first call me when the Lord gave me the Holy Ghost when the Lord hath filled me with the power I remember the first thing that I thought well when I got I was reminded of how brother Graham said very very few will go all the way to receiving the new birth very very few and you think well that that means very few will go all the way to receiving it in that moment listen friends I hate to sound negative but I believe I believe that things are proving out that very very few have gone on to receive a real born-again experience not just talking about adoption but just the baby form born again experience and so I want to encourage you I want to lay it out before you it's time to get desperate let's so let's be on fire for revelation let's be on fire to see the promised son be born in us maybe the musician can go and come and I'm gonna try to wine it up right there because look we talked about making a stand making a stand you need to do this listen to this kind of music don't listen to that kind of music do they dress this kind of way take a stand for the gospel this is the way that you should be doing but you can't do that until God calls you otherwise it's just delaying what obeying a set of rules obeying a set of rules that your mom and daddy have set for you obeying a set of rules that your your pastor or whoever has set for you but when God comes down and begins to speak to your heart then it becomes a living reality it becomes something that God moving on the inside and he gives you he gives you something to stand with but until you get that Ephesians 4:13 says wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that you may believe all day and having done all to stand see you do everything that you can to stand you do everything that you can do to stand you do all that you can understand and then God will take care of the rest amen you believe that tonight let's stand on our feet and just and I just worship them for a little bit go ahead brother there's two for two minutes part of the windows of heaven are open name and they are the blessings are falling
