TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] we'll be the leading one at that mean [Music] and be back in his house of worship and thank brother Joe will sing in his presence I believe this for the loss but since certain days time maybe we still have a hard to call it but you can just feel the presence of the Lord moving among his place we don't read this morning from Psalm 107 verse 1 through 20 let's pray Heavenly Father again we're grateful that we were able to come together to worship Father we thank you while we have this opportunity Lord let us receive all the blessings that we can from your holy word for the words that

thirsty their souls fainted in them and he led them forth about the right way that they may go to a city of habitation for he satisfy the longing soul and filthy hunger so with goodness because they rebelled against the words of God they to manage this council to the Most High then they cried unto the Lord in that trouble and he saved them out of their distress oh that man would praise the Lord for His goodness and for his wonderful works to the children I mean fools because of that transgression and because of their iniquities are afflicted then they cry unto the Lord in that trouble and he saved them out of that distress he sent His Word and healed them and delivered them from that distress god bless you [Music] oh I want to see [Music] openly as Allah I want to see you amen I want to

boards class and sister Monica's class will be practicing at 12:30 and it's supposed to watch singing this at 12:45 supposed to be singing this afternoon not the children okay so that's that's part of it okay all right father we thank you for your grace in your love we thank you for the day in the time that we have for the opportunity to come together to set aside a little time during a week and and and sit down and rejoice and just wait on you to manifest yourself and let your loving grace be with us Lord just remember all the sick among us you promised it you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we believe you so remember all of these that are not here a brother did sister Kathy and the different ones that are sick just let your grace and love be with all of us we love you and we thank you now as we read your words you come and speak to our hearts and let your light shine to each one in Jesus name Amen we've been reading this scripture for quite a while but we still will keep on reading and I guess for a while too so we're going to first Peter 1:22 and 23 seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again now how not of corruptible seed that we're not caring about the seeds and the things because everything is corruptible but other in what is the incorruptible seed of God but by the end corrupt by the Word of God which liveth and about us forever so let's go over now to 2nd Peter 1 or we've been reading from we'll read about 7 vs. silent Peter servant an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ who's Peter riding to not to the world he's writing to the church those that are in Christ ok grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and Jesus our Lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue so there's a position you're called to a position the position is glory and virtue all right whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and the knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now what have we been doing for all of these time is studying on the stature of a perfect man all right so Peter is here writing to you and I to tell us how to come where he was he had reached that position of faith he had reached that new birth and they had been tutored for three and a half years by the Lord Jesus and then when the Holy Ghost fell on them it placed them at the point where we know on the pyramid is called a Holy Spirit you know just above the brotherly kindness and coming in there too bring to that position but that was lost down through the ages by the cankerworm pommel worm locust caterpillar eating away they ate away these things and had to be restored all right now as I said about Peter he's speaking to those of the same faith so everybody has the new birth you're born again at faith faith is a revelation from God and what is the new word Christ the mystery of God revealed it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you not to everybody personally to you bringing Christ into you so Peter had that and he's addressing it to people that had received it as a new birth on the day of Pentecost but as I've always tried to explain it to you you go to the day of Pentecost and you got a split condition you got a hundred and twenty that was Peter and James and all of them and they had been tutored three and a half years and then when the Holy Ghost fell it positioned them to what we call the faith of the fathers are the the the point you know they're the opening of the word all right but then there was 3,000 see in just a little short period of time that they received the Holy Spirit but it didn't put them it made them babies desire in the sense fear of milk of the word that they may grow thereby it didn't put them where the Apostles were all right so the Apostles start writing the word you know they're writing the word and Peter's writing to tell us how to come to where he was because brother branham what was he trying to do trying to tell us how to come to where he was what is the purpose of anybody's preaching her thoughts they I'm trying to bring us out to you I'm wanting you to understand where I'm talking about what I'm doing and I want you to come to this place to heard it I've come to that place and telling you about it now what our problems has been a lot of times is people talking about something they didn't possess they had a confession but they didn't have a possession and that's been the problem through the ages at times but you know now we should be at the end time because we've received the message we've got the entire Bible unveiled before us because of the prophets message bringing it to us and in allowing us to follow it and understand and that's why that to me it's so marvelous to think about the Prophet and the things he was doing and I've tried to make a little illustration for the past two or three services that you know in the Bible we read something and we use words because that's not the way we can express what we do it it's through words all right and we say words what I like but a word here if you said and we heard brother Branham you know he'd say oh we're going on we used to his little boys we used to go down here and go singing no he was saying it right because that's northern word let's see we're southern and seen and didn't you know it took me I had to go to the Webster one day I kept hearing that and I thought I'm gonna see what that is that's the same word I know see we call it signing but it's the same word it's just from north and south you know and you know but that way I'm trying to tell you that a prophet comes and he gives you the understanding of the word even though the words are not spelled that away right and that's what we've driven pretty hard in the message of like virtue the faith then go to virtue will enter natural terminologies we would go to virgin birth maybe that way our a person being a virgin we wouldn't connect it but a random when he brought it he said now it's not like that word here in other word in this statue of perfect man it's more or less to the point of a virtuous life and power and strength and thing all right then we come on over to very faith virtue or knowledge temperance see temperance to us means don't drink alcohol all right let's see he said that's not according to this is here this is not that he said this is the controlling of that temper in things all right of course we didn't like that because we didn't think we still had any temper you know we thought we we taught that it all went out when we got saved and then you cross from just a little bit and start getting the red face and start puffing up you know and when you do then you find out that maybe somewhere there's a little bit of need of patience you know into our lives but the point of what I'm getting at is when we get into this when we're gonna talk about godliness and why would brother around him say you know a man like that he said I looked for the word godliness and in many dictionaries well the way it sounds like that he couldn't find a definition of godliness what now that's not what he's saying because he's saying I couldn't find what I wanted he wanted to find a definition of godliness that would be according to him and these scriptures and what to expect to see because you pick up any dictionary check it any dictionary you look up godliness it'll give you the definition of godliness but it doesn't refer to what he's saying of godliness I've checked you know a little bit of it it simply means to be to be like God is to be possibly religious to be a good Christian to do different things like that but when he comes to godliness he said godliness is to be like God will you say well that's supposed to be the possum to do this that no no it's not anyway it's to be like God because that's the definition we're beginning to but I want you to see that see a prophet gives you the definition of a word it gives you an understanding of a word that Scofield's and Webster's and Strong's and all won't give to you so we depend upon what he's saying you know all right see then to talk about godliness today now we're going to talk about to be like God then you'll say is we'll get to and reading a little bit you'll say well we do that well we'll get to the point in a minute to see what it is because see I'm a firm believer tried to express to you 40-something years or more preaching on this that we have to have these virtues that is spoken of in Peter it's not just a message of a good thought or something he's trying as I said a moment ago Peter's trying to tell you to get where he was at which he was up you know up here where it says Holy Spirit when he received the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost it was right here we received the Holy Spirit of the new birth down here as a baby come on coinsurance not I don't mean this sarcastic but it's the truth well it gets me as the people of this message can't understand we taught that in the Baptist Church we talking about this church that when you're saved you was only saved as a baby in Christ we taught that in a Baptist Church what's wrong with our understanding was we said well we don't the brother Dale he's he's this out of the other no I'm just trying to get you to see something straight a lot of these things were taught but it was not able to put it together the way the Prophet wrote then he brought it and he said now these things here are required of you when I remember Richard when he first time he said it today he's read it and everything he said I didn't know that these things were required what see we find what we were Christian we were born again we're automatically on our way to heaven we got every time we packed up and ready to go and then Peter says but you still got a little problem with your temperance you got a little problem with your patience and the whole of the hat you know and we say no no we don't have no problem we were we were we we got everything that's good badness we got everything when we leave and I know I said it to them back then as well as I say it now I said why does the Bible say being born again you know why does it say that's what I asked a pastor that was there when I left I said why does the Bible say that he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved I said how come y'all told us all we had to do is believe they said well I don't know I said you know yourself that that's the way you teach it you teach it all we got to do is believe and the devil bleed and trembles about it and he said well I guess you're right I said well that's true you didn't tell us the whole truth the word is believeth continually going on being born again continually going on it's not just walk up the altar accept Jesus Christ hey glory hallelujah we're on the way to heaven well that's kind of our thoughts but that's not gonna work out that away all right now but you you get what I'm saying then that these things are required of us to be back to the faith of the father's the faith of the father's is a revelation of the father's see then that has to be in the Bride of Christ and we read it to you there Wednesday from the Chrysler mystery of God I mean from statute of perfectman paragraph like 354 words brother Branham is talking about the church and he said the church that has these virtues in other words he said that's the church that's going in going to rapture huh and he said on the end of visual that has these virtues is the person that's going in the rapture so what's the requirement of a rapture we spoke of a rapture for 50 years right since we've been in the message we talked to the rapture but what is the rapture rapture is a revelation is that the way the Prophet said if you don't raptures a revelation well I I'm expecting a revelation more than I am some kind of a move or some point I'm looking for the opening of the word all right so then he says without these virtues you're not gonna have a rapture then he goes on in the same message another paragraph or so and he says you're not going to have the resurrection without these virtues but brother Daly can this resurrection didn't come rapture is gonna come you're not listening to what he's saying if somebody don't get these virtues I didn't say it he's the one that said it and the Bible said it they without us cannot be made perfect and we're gonna get to that in a minute in the godliness to try to tie that together the that they without us the whole thing is waiting on somebody to come to the place to walk where the apostles were walking as a possession and not a confession right the difference in the confession and the possession you can walk on a possession confession you can't walk on it it will hold you you'll sink but you won't sink if we walk in my faith all right that's that right see they know what did he say he said that that church would have to come now I'm on three sixty four seven statue a perfect man the church has got to come he said to these virtues and he called it perfection right that's what he called it he said perfection the church he's got to come to perfection then he said then it'll bring the resurrection and he said and they are waiting on us what to come to perfection well we can't be perfect so they'll never be a change he'll never be a rapture we'll just keep on going but somebody's going to come to it because God said it all right he promised it it'll be there we may not be part of it but we got an opportunity to be part of it we see he says that the church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection to perfection that's literally his word to use the word perfection twice in that paragraph showing that we've got to come to a place where the disciples were because they're waiting on us well I wish you would get this one natural little point if things are waiting on us then we're gonna have to match what they had they're not waiting on it doesn't say that the church is just waiting you know the Paul and Peter and all them was waiting on somebody to get born-again it don't say that it's a position it's a place that they were at you're not gonna pull Paul out of the ground with a Baptist doctrine I don't care it may be a true doctrine it may have brought eternal life to the people back there but it will not do it today right see it won't do it now it's a position this endtime is going to have to reach to draw the dead from the grave see then what God wants to do after the resurrection we're going to be here thirty forty days we can have a great glorious time shouting and and everything you'd be preaching all across the land and running back and forth doing everything brother Branham spoke of but there's got to be a resurrection first because remember according to the Bible it says the dead in Christ shall rise first and we wish to know Ivan Tremaine it's alright those are the windows go not to raise so I'm looking for as I've always told you I'm not looking for a rapture I'm looking for a resurrection all right because that way we're resurrected out of our denominationalism awake thou that sleepless the scripture says this prophet said that was the bride that was the sleep in organized religion brother Dale I wouldn't sleep okay you are you won't do about it I just said what he said I admit where I come from I admit we was coming down through there sleeping in slumber and then thought was right don't you but come to find out the Prophet said no you're not that's where you told the Pentecost he said you say you got your here you've got lighter rain lighter rain you got all these movement he said you ain't even had to form a rain yet how do you think those people felt when he said it like that alright but now listen and we'll get to godliness in a second to pick up that it means to be like God all right now Hebrews 11:40 says they without us should not be made perfect alright now when Paul wrote that he was not in the grave but he was writing it as an us which would apply to everything in everybody you know what the next day maybe he was in the grave you know what he was doing waiting on us he wouldn't waiting on him we're not waiting on Paul that's where everybody puts we're waiting on this now no no we're not waiting on those things they're waiting on us to simply believe the prophets message and walk out on it the whole world is waiting on us what are we here for we're here to prove to Satan the Prophet said that we wouldn't fall like Eve fell we're here to prove those things all right bring it on devil I mean make us go what did the Prophet say he said the bride always done better on the persecution now I ain't won't no persecution I ain't won't no slim bellies because you know that I could they took a food away from me I'm not talking like that I'm not crazy little dumb but not crazy I'm talking about that somebody has got to become the word to draw the rest what's going to draw them out we're not going to walk down to the cemetery it's a Cologne no that's why I've got the pictures downstairs of the people that have passed on get to see your sister back there with we say welcome to UK we've got a teachers there of the people that have died I won't know what you look like you know why because I won't know what you look like when you're raised when they walk among us I don't problem I go to hey we got your picture you know because I believe the resurrection is going to come and one day they're gonna walk among us but it's not going to be on impt and cemeteries it's not going to be running down to the cemetery to pray and in the race no it's the faith you're walking in when that faith drops in the heart of the people you're gonna see the dead race that's as simple as I can make it when the faith drops in the heart all right then somebody's gonna have to not go out and call the dead but somebody's gonna have to call all of us dead heads out of our sleep and wake us up into Jesus Christ and then he'll take care of the rest of it where's the glory going to him no resurrection they no resurrection without Jesus Christ all right but I do love one thing the Prophet said you know I don't mean I don't love the rest of it but that's the point he said the resurrection was inside of you your resurrection is in you it's in your spirit and as I said the other day that's not in your memory reason conscience affection spirit it's in the Holy Spirit because like that word is if brother dick Addison was here he'd need amen this point because he you take the word spirit and the word soul and you run it through the Bible and you'll find out it's a totally interchangeable word it glows so legs together till when you've got to find out what they're talking about to see what it means in that's that part you say well that's just my spirit Jesus's spirit him in the garden now if his spirit left him in the garden as a prophet said it did and we play that as his spirit before then he died because you can't live without your spirit what left him in the garden the power the anointing the things that was there with him that would not let him die he had that had to be removed from the human element so he could finally die for our sins all right now so then this is to the point of what we see the wordings but do we understand the terminologies or thoughts that goes with the things like I said there the Prophet would say now this year word virtue said it doesn't mean just being a virgin well he wouldn't against being a virgin no he believed in that but that was not the definition to be used in understanding Peters wording when he used the word virtue and probably he didn't use the word virtue we just used the Greek or Hebrew or whatever that word was see if we could go back and read those things we may be catching better onto what those word actually say you know but we take Webster's definition cuz we're you know yet we're English and you take that word virtue over to Germany there's no telling what you might find the word for you get me let's see Peter he brought it and then when they put the King James into it they used the word virtue what's the thing we had the definition it means virgin that was not Peter saying Peter was looking at a virtuous life with power in Christ see that way you can get the meaning of the word and it unfolds the rest of the story to where you can follow it and see that way then it doesn't matter about the educational side of you the most illiterate person can understand God because God can speak to them they don't have to speak inaudible voices talking inner word or whatever you know they can do all of those things because that's the way it is that he can talk to anybody and do but now that are you following me then we'll get to the word godliness because we kind of take one thing in another thing another me this is the one that is the I don't know what you could use that a big fancy thing they say this is the catchphrase or whatever you're saying you know in other words this is something to anchor and it settles it I've waited a long time to get to this part right here to where I can say what I want to say about this and I believe it will help us to understand all of the background of the virtues and the things that's required and what it is because we look at it as being something that cannot be attained and not come on if you're a human when you first read about the word virtue that the way the Prophet used it our definitions was different from what his thinking was especially now as we getting out to godliness and he looked up in the dictionaries now he got four dictionaries he said four or five he said and he looked up the word godliness well he didn't get the understanding from all of those dictionaries that he knew Peter was saying so you can say well godliness means pie or you know the different things I'm getting it's in here somewhere but it means all of those things the word see godliness but then he said it means to be like God all right now he entered it in so marvelous a way of understanding until it's amazing to the human mind to think that you have to realize it had to be God irregardless of you using godliness do you realize that it has to be God to reveal to us even what that means what does it mean to be be like God what does that mean well it's supposed to be like God we're just supposed to be like no no the Toki's of the day we don't want to be like God that's the Antichrist he likes to be like God no huh now we don't want to be like God the children of God is not like God the children of God is God made manifest in another form called a church right or whatever the words are we were discussing something there last night and it came to me on the penet night after because we were discussing like where it says you know that this group of people receives eternal life that's a bride well this group has to go somewhere else to get eternal life you know well that I brought I thought laying there thinking about it and then you know kind of halfway asleep and I thought about it you know to me now we know adoption and we know how it works and all that and it goes into the spiritual but still in the physical you're thinking about it and what I've thought about saying see that we wonder well how come it cause this group abroad and this group over here a foolish virgin remember according to your prophet it's the same material of the dress right the bride ain't no piece of material different from the foolish virgin it's the same piece of material it's the same religious realm but made possible by the blood of Jesus Christ alright now see then that means this group in this group the materials are same it's just and we were talking about how that it means that one can have a confession and the other one has a possession well I thought about it this way maybe a hippie see adoption all right you adopt somebody else's child now we you know we go into adoption we dropped his own children etcetera that's not what I'm trying to express and I'm trying to get you to look at something see we we our children are our children by blood right there are our blood children but an adopted child is not your blood children but they're just as much your children after they're adopted as it is for your blood children there's the difference between the bride are the you know the church and the foolish virgin it's the same material it's just what's chosen this is his people his offspring these are adopted in to him being an offering and we'll get to it on adoption see we Gentiles had to be adopted in we had no right of adoption the right of adoption was to the Israelites then the Bible says that we had no we'll get to that later as was covering the message but you think about it see that way you can see this is blood relation this is everything this is looking just exactly like it look it is not to blood relation God's children our God made manifest now why wouldn't we believe it that well yeah but brother Dale I thought the Bible says I thought Paul said it's not our that liveth but Christ that liveth in me and the life that I now live by the faith he wouldn't count nothing he had he was going on to what God was calling him all right see God's children is God made manifest it's in another form right so then take that as to the thought that when you're saying godliness is not to try to be like God because the Antichrist wants to be like God everything is to be like God the religious world is because they come on we come from all over we we we taught the bloodline of the new birth but in actuality we couldn't separate all of this other so we just lumped it all into one and we just had everybody that could ever get eternal life they were the children of God no that's not according to the scripture only the born-again believer that gets born again here is the child of God foolish virgin has to go somewhere and get eternal life and by doing that see they're not the children of God in the bloodline they're the children of God as he's imparted unto them the way all right follow that thought and then you'll think about godliness that it means to be like God but not to be like God like somebody wants to be like God it's to be God now it'll clear up then why he's bringing all of these things but now I want to quote these couple here see this church marker 367 a statue of a perfect man they can pull it up they went to number two this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection well uh we can't come to perfection brother Dale not there is our argument an old Baptist argument we argued over Matthew 5:48 be therefore perfect and we had ever form of a way to try to explain that instead of just saying what it said that God says we're perfect as far as God is concerned with perfect as far as everybody else is concerned we'll never be perfect you will never be perfect I'll never be perfect in the people's eyes and mind but in God solves all things so then the church and it says and they're under sold under the altar waiting for the church to come to prove to its perfection that when Christ come waiting somebody's waiting on you or not me no I'm not the window flames or flicks blanket for everybody right now if it's in the grave is waiting on the end town bride no we're just waiting the time runs out and then okay it's all right without any according to the scripture if the Bible's right I say that for your concern not mine then if the prophets right of expressing how to come to perfection what is it going to require he's going to have to give us the definition of perfection that will fit to what we can follow and then he's going to how to give us a way are Short's the way to come to that perfection well we just get born again I don't understand brother Dale he just always want us to what do you want us to do we come to church we pay our tithes we we do this we love the Lord another all I want you to do is just die what a man that's read over he was here when Jim Jones happened you know and he had them people they died you know this guy as Fred said Freddie Sam ever tried to get you died he's that ever service that he tried to kill me as long as he's known me and ever service preaching to me he want me to die out to myself and we come into Christ all right see we can't come no other way that into Christ to think about perfection because perfection in the human race cannot be accomplished you think you get something out of the way don't worry about it they're gonna be something flop you down and just two minutes from time you think you've got that straightened out there's going to be another one there's no perfection in the human race the perfection is Jesus in Jesus Christ art if we have then a perpetuation if we have an offer and if we have a sacrifice is not it's though that in the Old Testament when they offered that sacrifice that at least maybe for that year you know it made Buuren had to offer it again or another year but do you realize when that sacrifice was offered God's coming into destroyed about the time the blood comes up he backs off he can't come over it because he's the one that said it he's the one that made the way and you're just doing what he says so what makes us perfect oh we're good I remember one of the Baptist Church talking about David I mean that's the dirtiest guy you've ever seen Judas Iscariot ain't no hype of a mean guy when you compare it to David the Bible says David was a man after God's own heart well it's got an adulteress no no see no no no that's not what it is David had a heart to cry out for forgiveness he had an honest and a contrite heart he had a willing heart to repent Scofield even declares it better rent him to closure on the way home from the bed with Bathsheba he cries out Lord return unto me the joy of thy salvation see but he couldn't do it it was under the blood of bulls and goats it couldn't take away those things enough to clear him but it would take and make him be that and the Bible says that you're a sacrifice and offerings he said they've become a stink in my nostrils that's God's definition to word in our offerings that he said for us to offer to make ourselves free for that year he says become a stink in my nostril but he said a man that's got an honest in the Contra heart till repentant heart in God means more than all the sacrifices because see a repentant heart leads you back to here alone how he asked maybe he has to he has to make away if he required us to do something he has to make away and he did through his own atonement through the blood all right see then it comes to that place run around gets over on walk ride excuse me why I'm against organized religion and he says don't just stand still you haven't got patience virtue all of these things and temperance and things and godliness and brotherly kindness all these things that's required of you the names of things that's required all of the virtues he said don't just stand still in other words we ought to be seeking he see Luther Wesley him in the coming down they didn't understand this so they were only trying to go to church and be good and give their lives and suffer for those things but we've got to be concerned with trying to come to perfection okay now let's go to number five when we read statue of a perfect man let's go to godliness and to see what the prophet has to say about godliness but then ye says it that away that's the point you can say well he said this out of the other sometimes you're writing sometimes you're wrong get the court already comes to these it's fearfully had godliness godliness be added what does godliness mean I looked in four or five dictionaries and couldn't even find what it meant nowadays the dictionary laying right in there are checked a while ago whose will brother Herman garland used to say he'd say the Bible says so and so I just read it while ago I know it's dark so I know in Webster there's a dictionary laying right in there that gives you the definition of godliness but it means Pais it means of that you know kind of like into a realm of holiness and thing but listen to what your prophet says about godliness what was he looking for a definition that fit what he was preaching not a definition to give him understanding of wordings or whatever he was looking to see what somebody brought it and he finally found it he said I looked in four or five dictionaries and couldn't even find what it meant finally I was down at brother Jeffrey's darting we found it in a dictionary godliness means to be like God oh my my you got faith virtue knowledge temperance patience and then see faith first or knowledge temperance patient then which means at that time or shortly thereafter it comes to a point of recognition of a starting because that's one of the word then is you see all right then after all of this then be like God then we're reading you realize God doesn't require you to be perfect until you reach godliness we're gonna read it let's see if you believe it that's why that you've got temperance and things like that that shows if you do have problems but like we were discussing yesterday the brother brought it out about the brother and we won't use his name on therefore the point but he talked her brother on him and he said there's no conscious of seeing or something no no condemnation he had reached a place that he could say there's no condemnation he had wetzel he had reached had achieved all right think about this then God then this means to be like God oh my you got faith virtue or knowledge temperance place then be like God he said we this listen you say I can't do that brother branham and I agree with you he was agreeing with cuz we can't do it we can't be perfect because will condemn our own selves there's nothing else but if he says I'm perfect why can't I say what he says come on I can't do that brother branham oh yes you can let me just read you now where did he go now listen look at what I'm talking about it's reading I told you that I've waited for months to preach this message all right he's talking about godliness right and the definition of godliness what's the first scripture he goes to when you would I would say back to him but brought around him I can't do it he said oh yes you can I'm gonna show you in the scripture where description he went to he didn't go to all of the paths and the deities and the things that you could read about God and how great he was and how he could be he didn't go to that look where he went to the very scripture we always argued and said we couldn't figure it out how can we be perfect oh that means this and it means that yeah this means is this means that that's mean and see I remember in the Baptist Church reading it and putting the dictionary and reading the dictionary and come to find out that perfect means complete hmm perfect we'll give it means full age perfection alright we see we're looking for perfect to be how great we are and how we didn't see in all week long I haven't done a thing all week long I haven't I like what would Jack Cole said that time when that lady come to him and said sir said I want you to pray for me I said I just can't control my tongue no Jack Cole was pretty stiff like me you know when there's talking a lot of time and he said back to her he said lady he said this pulpit only 14 or 15 feet long said ain't enough room for your tongue he was blood she wanted to do something bad we want to find out what it means to be perfect well we didn't do this we've done all of our penances we've done all of our praying we read all the books this week we've done everything correctly that we're supposed to do as Christians we've been wonderful and sweet and ever I think other thing to do with perfection that's if anything that's an outworking of perfection but it has nothing to do with perfection that don't make you perfect because you don't do wrong if it did what do you need a perpetuation why do you need something to take your place are you going to deny the scripture that we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous why do we have an advocate because we're going to do wrong but us Christians don't do wrong that's where you lied that's as much as saying it you could say well line is a bad thing well you just lied Brazil I don't never do wrong I had a wrong thought all week long you hadn't you've been asleep all week and then there's dreams in that Wright brothers asking these if you dream I said crazy and then I have him weird ins I don't get them good ones that y'all talk about I get them weird ones it's just all messed up and when I get through I wonder is that me you don't ever do that and you have your dreams and then you say the Lord is that ripping me cuz the dream show how bad I was you know I would tell you when I've had for 40 years a dream and it keeps coming back and every once in a while I get away from another waiter well I could tell you that and you just die life and what it does it and then here comes runaround said if you have the same dream two or three times it means something well why does all that 40 years being Lord am I that dirty I sure I'm glad there's a pot of beans that you can eat and mess up and can have a bad dream come on listen get you life and then now we'll go okay he says but I can't do that I can't be perfect I can't be excuse me I can't be like God then he goes to perfection and he says oh yes you can let me just read you a few scriptures here just a minute Matthew 5:48 will take this one and see what it sounds like Matthew 5:48 and see if you're supposed to be like God rah we're gonna take Matthew 5:48 to see if he's supposed to be like God we'll see why that he couldn't use the word you know godliness from other definitions they would not match this part because he would expecting the word godliness would go to piety deities in and all kind of things in that word of meaning and it would never match out how to that we can conquer this being that we are and come out of it as to be in what God wants us to be there's no way we can be perfect but I don't think we need to just keep volunteer and you know what I mean by that I don't think we need to justify all I can't help it Lord I know I said a dirty word while ago but I can't help it yeah you can you can zip your mouth up that's what I like about that one the other day was written where brother Owen said and over to faith virtue knowledge temperance and he said how to control that tongue he said that tattling tongue that was having to do with you I got a good one now that because it's my tongue all right listen he said let's go to Matthew 5:48 and see if you're supposed to be like God he's going to give you a definition of godliness right I mean right now you're going to give the definition of godliness so let's see if we can be like God what does God require for you and I to be to be like God what is his requirement so here you go you know the Bible says your gods jesus said so why all the virtue all the things that's in God is in you Matthew 5:48 how are we gonna be perfect by these things coming within us that we didn't get when we were born again right or else why would you need them okay now watch what he goes to Jesus speaking in the Beatitudes be therefore perfect what's that perfect even as your father now he's going to this Christian in evidence perfect now look I read that you've got way up here now before you're asked to do that listen you got up to godliness because that's what he's talking about before God asked you to be perfect you come all the way to godliness then he starts talking about perfection that's to be like God that's not your past and your deities and the thing see that you're trying to make yourself to be some kind of goody-goody no come on you got it well be there for perfect what's that perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect you got way up here now before you're asked to do that all these things has to be added first then when you get up here he's ask you now to be perfect godliness sons and daughters of God you see why I waited so long to try to get to this message because it shows what that we've got problems we get born again we have troubles and heartaches and problems then we got virtue to come in and that means that we we're it turned out to be a virgin life you know virtuous life then we come to knowledge not head knowledge Holy Ghost knowledge of God's Word then we come to temperance and then we come to patience and after we come all of that way then evidently we mixed it all the way down through there because we tried to figure out what Matthew 5:48 men now according to your prophet he puts Matthew 5:48 at godliness on the pyramid reading it but he puts it down with a perfect understanding that where we have the understanding instead of trying to figure out you come all the way then God expects you to be perfect well what about it you got way up here now before you're asked to do that before you're asked to be like God he's explaining Matthew 5:48 be therefore perfect he's explaining it now how do we come to perfection come on you want to quit and go home we listen to wait this evening or you want to continue a minute what's the next scripture brother Branham went to he went to Matthew 5:48 be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect and brother instead it's required of you and I to come today but he says now God didn't require this until it comes up here to godliness he didn't require those things to be the cause he understood he winked at her ignorances of not knowing and understanding and he would allow us in the body of Christ knowing that when when we come into the body of Christ we would still be babies babies blabber and run and do things wrong and he knew we would need virtue to cover up into those things but he knew the virtue that we would have to get a Bible definition of virtue and not a definition of it being just because you're a virgin but because that you've come to a virtuous life in Christ he doesn't say you're perfect guy did you come to knowledge and you come to tempered you come to patience and he knows that we're still gonna have a problem you said well I don't want no problem my temper is gone well I'm just don't let me rub the skin too much I might find out in a flare up just a little bit mine does you gonna say yours don't know I don't have no problems you lied who fits this 24 feet it still ain't long enough what's the difference in line cheating and stealing all the rest okay hey come on I'm trying to get a point across what's the next scripture if God is going to require us to be perfect and the Prophet says you say we can't intercept oh yes you can see we were approaching it wrong to try to find a some form of godliness something that we could say we had done or didn't do oh I believe the word well that's what I'm reading from right so what's the next scripture that he uses bring that back up brother call we want to come down so bring that up I want to just make sure to get this point and we'll quit on the rest of these other because listen right you don't back down where we get to Matthew 5:48 to get it in line to understand he's looked up in the dictionary trying to find godliness he can't find it he finally finds one definition says to be like God amen now we've got the Bible definition of the godliness that's in the statute of a perfect man we're not dealing with trying to be some deity or some pious or some super religious something we've come to something that can be attained what perfection but we can't be perfect that's what I mean there's no way we can be perfect that's why the word perfect we kept looking it up trying to find something worded it mean the word perfect means to complete complete let's see if I've got that now didn't read it off and yeah Matthew 5:48 this is the definition of the word dark we're talking of be therefore perfect it means to well they've got it okay what's the definition from the word perfect it means a full age three days it don't have anything to do with how goody-goody we are there's no definition of how good we are oh we've become good so we're perfect we don't do that no more we're perfect that ain't wanted it listen a full age something that's brought to its end cross it into the law of the right wanting nothing necessary to completeness wanting nothing that would be necessary to completeness all right perfect that which is perfect consummate human integrity and virtue of man full grown adult of full age or mature there's anything in there about how we need to quit this need to quit that and he'd do that then we could be perfect there's no wording of those things that's why he didn't want the definition of pious and good innocent and great things of being gone he wanted to what he got he wanted a definition of to be like God how can any human being ever be like God he can do it when he becomes a full-grown he's gonna be a baby and blabber until he comes to full grown he's gonna grow up into him the head of all things I'm i quoting scripture so what's the definition of perfect to come to completeness all right I thought we believed we were in the life stage I thought we believed that there were seven seals to the Bible and the seven would be the number of what what is the number seven completion they know eight completion right all right eight is eternity going on place where we're at so where are we at we're in the life stage showing that that well the ages all of the things is comparison and bringing out to understanding to come to completeness God keeps pouring in his life until he becomes complete in you and me what do you stop well we'll break down when we get to this completeness are we gonna stop sinning no that's where you missed the whole thing you're trying to get a sinless perfection I want a forgiveness I don't justify well I can't help it you know I can't help but drink a little bit now you know or Lila now now y'all for that that order ended with a new birth that order begin ended when you started serving Christ right but when you start saying well well alright now we've got to come to a place of completeness that there's nothing else that can be done alright see when you come to godliness now look what's gonna come next brotherly kindness we got a long ways to go get that okay you see I've waited for months to preach this but now watch brother branham you've described to us the fact that there is a possibility of a church realizing they're perfect to match up Matthew 5:48 now we've got the definition because you gave the definitions to it of understanding that that does not mean a great religious Society a great thing of no sin why because the Prophet said as long as you're in this flesh now he didn't say you had to he didn't say it was okay he said long as you in this flesh you gonna be a sticker don't worry about it don't worry about it it's gonna be there if we worried as much about it try to keep that away as we do okay all right let's see something brought to an end that's worth a great message I'm hoping way to hurry up because see the 7th seals the end of all things that's what's your profits I didn't like that statement he said the 7th seal is the end of all time he says the end of the millennium is in to this the end of time either he said time even runs out on the seventh seal we're coming back to a simple little thoughts of our mind and doing that live in every day and find it out we're right in the midst of the seals seeing seeing it in the simplicity what it's supposed to really okay now brother branham what are we gonna do now so when I remember the paragraph number 302 where's that we jumped a thrill for real to going up or down there which way y'all go going to 304 now this is a continuation of where we were okay when he was describing the Matthew 5:48 and the perfection and how that is the way it's supposed to be all right now watch what he said so now he's going to tell you how to become perfect let's see if you'll accept this one okay let's turn to Ephesians 4 okay and find out over here what in the book of Ephesians it says about this thing let's find out what it says about this thing of to be like God and perfection and completeness let's see what it says about it about how that we should how we should do Ephesians 4 chapter see now get what I'm saying before we read all of this it looks like that that you asked brother branham's okay now brother branham we've got this laid out about the 5:48 and the perfect number now how do we do it and then he start writing down don't do this don't do that quit doing this do that do all these things he doesn't do that he goes immediately to Ephesians forward how are you gonna be perfect I didn't write the book it says by the fivefold ministry right we don't want this one okay how should we Ephesians 4 chapter and begin with the 12 verse he's in for 12 and again with the twelfth verse alright and he gave some apostles and some prophets remember last night don't try to take the other man's office National Adoption right and some evangelists and some pastors and some teachers for the perfecting of God does it read that like that congregation says no now he said the perfection of what Saints listen Saints who are the Saints now you can go through all that definition we know who the Saints are they're in Christ okay great but give what a saying who are the Saints the sanctified ones listen the ones that started from down here the ones that started from down here at faith the ones that started with a new birth and all of that will be for the perfecting or the work of the ministry the ministry Jesus Christ for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come into the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God into the perfect man unto the assurance oh my to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ now you know yourself what I've always talked to you you show me any other thing any other scripture that shows you anything other than the fivefold ministry for the perfecting the Saints I want to see it I want to see a quote from the Prophet I mean I want to see a quote I want to see a scripture or a quote that perfection will come any other way than the fivefold ministry well you know if that's true if that's true I believe it is that's leaving back that away but if that's true then if we don't accept the fivefold ministry there's no hoax or perfection now we read when we started off that they were was going to be no rapture without these virtues we we're quoting it at least and there's gonna be no resurrection without these virtues all right now he's putting it too far for ministry but I just can't believe it I agree with you now I don't know how arguing with nobody this goes out on internet but I got no argue with nobody I wouldn't listen to the biggest portion of the ministers of this message myself I don't have time to fool around I don't mean that derogatory or nice theory and I just mean the truth I ain't going to sit and listen to somebody that taste has to tell me what you need to be perfect is you need to quit this now if we could just get our women straightened up if we could get all them women it's always the preacher is always picking on the women it's never the preacher picking on the men the man's got the money it's always picking on the women well I kept quoting that until finally you know there is a direct quote on is your life or the gospel there is a direct quote another drug around there is your wife worthy of the gospel now read the message you'll find it I don't think he's picking on women to you I think he was talking about the bride but listen even if he was talking about it why should we not be willing to take the correction that goes with it as I said the other night about the virtues in sight if we say we need them if we say we don't have them and we need them were to be on her knees crying out to God and all I'm doing is trying to tell you what he's saying that the Bible says what is for the perfecting of the Saints the fivefold ministry why because they're supposed to brain and brother branham I gave you a quote out of statue of a perfect man he said to file full ministry to bring these things into being how is the virtuous gonna come into be there's one thing for sure you order no they brother Dale hollers and screams enough to your to have patience by now so I've done that much now waiting all the old brothers you take on wounds and are because I've at least got the people to patience why cuz I screamed and hollered for 40-something years trying to get people to this place alright you pick up and take it on cause it's a 5-4 minutes right in one fold well I'm rather short so well no brother so annoying outside the five fold ministry I don't care what his name is I don't care who he is or what he's saying he ain't outside the five fold ministry brother branham was outside the five fold ministry cuz he was a messenger to the aged but the others is in the five fold ministry so anybody that the Brother sewing souls in the five fold ministry he's only in the five full minutes just like everybody else in the five full minutes which means there's apostles prophets evangelists pastors which means we gotta have all five of them not one well all we needed Lulu is a teacher uh uh you see who I bring in I try to bring in people that are evangelists or more up being than beating than I am and more you know to preach to you the things you can comprehend and and follow along the line because that's for the perfecting I'm buddy holler and scream at you for weeks and months and some brother come walking in don't know a thing in the world and then he starts preaching and all at once everybody says glory hallelujah I see that now well okay we got it it's a five full minute you know what I gotta have a fivefold ministry I've got to have a pasture well I thought you was the pastor the pastor's gotta have a pastor who you gonna pay you tithe to you got to pay you power tithe to the pastor know who you're gonna pay it to it you can't send Ertz jefferson bill I'm sorry I'll put it bluntly playing because that's where I am some people ain't gonna like that but you can't send your time to Jeffersonville oh you can do better now since Joseph has announced that he's a pastor of that you can send it that's fine but you know what I'm talking about for 40 years he ain't declared that and people just flooded the money desire but you got to give you Todd to where your pastors what are you listening are you listening this simple little thought go ahead to number seven continuation of the reading from where we're at from the statue of a perfect man perfect godliness you have to add to your faith godliness see you start off down here with virtue then you go to knowledge then you go to templates then you go to places then now now your own godliness godliness oh my our times are not two but you know what godliness means we sing the song could be like Jesus godliness how do we achieve to godliness now is it true musicians come on is it true that in the Old Testament they had a high priest trying to give an illustration now so following it is it true under the Old Testament they had a high priest it was not the second-in-command that made the sacrifices right he wasn't a god that was in training to be the high priest to come up after this high priest died or you get what I mean you can't put it on something else the high priest was the only one that could take the sacrifice he's the only one that could go behind and come out alive maybe not carrying nothing but come out alive meant that the people had been accepted right you remember what the story they had a rope tied to him and had to bail tonight if they stopped they took the rope started pulling because nobody couldn't go back there they had to drag him out if he was dead meant to something wrong then it had to get everything right hey come on if I had high priests I'd have said to Moses and Moses no boy no check me one more time to make sure that I'm right what God told you to dress me is everything in place he's my hair comb right he's my everything my ride and he says far as I know I said okay I'll go go don't want no problem because it was the only one can go behind the veil then we're not trying to go behind the veil of five full ministry that's where they messed it up see they think that brother Branham brought a message now that gotta go get a message we don't have to go get a message this message was brought by the Prophet now I've preached that to you so you don't have no right to frown upon me about it you know that that's true we don't have a message well brother Branham come to introduce hey I've been through all of that I've listened to that in the 70s when a man sit in my house and said something I said yeah I know what y'all teach you teach it brother Branham just swept off the foundation but now you got to build a building but I said do you ain't got no quote from brother Branham and you ain't got no Bob Walker he didn't like it but that's all right I'm sorry he asked me and I told him if you don't want to know nothing from this old war don't ask him right I'm the baddest Terrence on that you asked if you want to know something terrorists just ask him if you don't want to know what he got to say you better not asking because he's more blunt than I am he's preached he told Sunday school one time five minutes and quit he ain't done it since then I told you I said you don't want me over here I don't mean anything wrong about it he just straight honest you know but that's the guys we need behind us thank God for that but do you understand what I'm driving at what is it to be godliness it's to be like God and God is perfect then if he requires us to be perfect he makes away and it's still his blood to make you and I had to come to the place to be in perfect being complete being to a finish of all things bring Mr godliness the brother Brown said you've come all this way and said now they requires that you be perfect well that order show us then that somewhere down through there he had to bypass a lot of things if he's anybody ever reached that garden in this he had to bypass a lot of things you say well brother Dale where are you at what is it I've only told you one time that God spoke to me he said to me one day he said if you'll have patience with the people said it'll prove you got patience you know heart ain't proved it got patience yet cuz I don't I get all upset I still got that down in that virtue and that temperance and things I get upset because we don't follow the word but to work what I get upset at coz we won't listen to the true word we want some other big thing to tantalize our ears and think instead of reading how do we come perfect the fivefold ministry your prophet just said that and without the fivefold ministry there's no way to be perfect they didn't maybe water settled I am but it's like I've said and I'll say it again I'm not gonna listen to a lot of em preachers I try to claim to be preachers they don't come in here to preach ain't gonna let them come in here to preach to you some garbage can that they've got the great glory bypasses sometimes now get caught I have to come back and straighten it out you know but I'll do as quick as I can cuz I ain't gonna leave things dangling you know I'm gonna do the best I can to try to bring us all to perfection and perfection is completeness I want to finish what the prophets started let's tan or we got brother yo let's sing this little course pass me anybody ever need opacity not Odin to say here

studies and contemplating on this Lord to try to get us to see there is a possibility of coming to perfection there's a possibility of a human being that can be perfect see we reject that because we think we can't do it we know we can't do it but we know you can do it you already took care of it as that animal it was back there took care of everything for another year you didn't condemn them
