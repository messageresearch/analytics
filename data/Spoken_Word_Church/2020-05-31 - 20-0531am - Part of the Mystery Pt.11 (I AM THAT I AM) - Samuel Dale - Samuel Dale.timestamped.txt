[4:50] we love you and we thank you have your
[4:52] way in Jesus name amen if you'd like to
[4:55] turn in Exodus 3
[5:02] we'll try to pick up our thought and
[5:04] continue on from where we've been
[5:07] speaking about this Exodus
[5:10] 3 now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his
[5:14] father-in-law the priest of Midian and
[5:16] he led the flock to the backside of the
[5:18] desert and came to the Mountain of God
[5:21] even to Horeb and the angel of the Lord
[5:23] appeared unto him in a flame of fire out
[5:26] of the midst of a bush and he looked and
[5:29] behold the bush burned with fire and the
[5:33] Bush was not consumed and Moses said I
[5:36] will now turn aside and see this great
[5:39] sight why the bush is not burnt and when
[5:42] the Lord saw that he turned aside to see
[5:45] now I like that when the Lord saw now he
[5:48] knew he was going to turn and everything
[5:50] else but still Moses was was part of it
[5:53] wanted to to look and see God called
[5:56] unto him out of the midst of the Bush
[5:58] and said Moses Moses mooses and he said
[6:00] here am I and he said draw not nigh
[6:04] hither put off thy shoes from off thy
[6:07] feet and for the for the place whereon
[6:09] thou standest is Holy Ground moreover he
[6:13] said now this God speaking once now I am
[6:16] the god of thy father the god of Abraham
[6:20] the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob
[6:22] remember I told you last week the way to
[6:24] read that is really to say I am the god
[6:27] of thy father I am the god of Abraham I
[6:30] am the god of Isaac I am the god of
[6:33] Jacob because he's in it's Illustrated
[6:36] there to the point and Moses hid his
[6:38] face for he was afraid to look upon God
[6:41] and the Lord said I have surely seen the
[6:43] Affliction of my people which are in
[6:45] Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason
[6:47] of their task Masters for I know their
[6:50] sorrows and I am come down to deliver
[6:53] them out of the hand of the Egyptian and
[6:55] to bring them out of that land with a
[6:58] good unto a good land a large unto a
[7:02] land flowing with milk and honey unto
[7:04] the place of the Canaanites and the
[7:06] Hittites and the amorites and the pites
[7:08] and the hivites and the
[7:10] jebusites now therefore Behold The Cry
[7:14] of the children of Israel is come unto
[7:17] me and I have also seen the oppression
[7:20] wherewith the Egyptians oppressed them
[7:24] come now therefore and I will send thee
[7:28] un Pharaoh that thou th must bring forth
[7:30] my people the children of Israel out of
[7:33] Egypt and Moses said unto God who am I
[7:37] that I should go unto pharaoh and that I
[7:39] should bring forth the children of
[7:41] Israel out of Egypt and he said
[7:43] certainly I will be with thee and this
[7:45] shall be a token unto thee that I have
[7:48] sent thee when thou Hast brought forth
[7:51] the people out of Egypt ye shall serve
[7:53] God upon this mountain and Moses said
[7:56] unto God behold when I come unto the
[7:59] children of Israel and say unto
[8:02] them the god of your fathers has sent me
[8:05] unto you and they shall say to me what
[8:10] is his name what shall I say unto
[8:15] them and God said unto Moses I am that I
[8:20] am and he said thus shalt thou say unto
[8:23] the children of Israel I am hath sent me
[8:26] unto you you may be seated the Lord had
[8:29] his blessing to the reading of the word
[8:32] now we were trying last week to uh you
[8:35] know get a uh kind of a
[8:40] layout and uh an understanding of what
[8:45] is taking place cuz that's what I like
[8:47] to to do that's the reason I like that
[8:49] you know like I said there when you're
[8:51] reading it more I am the god of Abraham
[8:54] well it's not put in there because it's
[8:56] doing but then you can say I am the god
[8:59] of Isaac
[9:00] I am the god all right now when we get
[9:02] down to the bottom in a minute you'll
[9:04] see the emphasis of that and why we we
[9:07] keep talking about it all right so we've
[9:10] been going through kind of the Old
[9:11] Testament looking at the things there
[9:14] and saw that uh it says in Genesis God
[9:18] created and it's 30s something times
[9:21] there in the Book of Genesis 1 God
[9:23] created all right that's not in total
[9:26] capitalization and things because
[9:28] remember our story when God is here on
[9:32] Earth when God is speaking to mankind
[9:34] from
[9:36] Heaven it'll say the Lord Capital great
[9:39] big letters and things like that because
[9:41] it's emphasizing where it's from he
[9:44] spoke to even to Cain the Lord the
[9:48] capital letters and things you know and
[9:51] then when it would come on down see then
[9:52] it from Genesis one it would be
[9:55] God and then when you get to Genesis 2
[9:57] you'll pick it up and three and start
[9:59] from their own it'll be Lord God capital
[10:03] letters and things like that begins to
[10:05] appear which is to emphasize the
[10:08] importance of what you're talking about
[10:10] all right A noun is supposed to be
[10:12] started off with a with a capital letter
[10:15] because it's the name of a person place
[10:16] or thing see it can be brought all the
[10:19] way through because you're using the the
[10:21] letters like that not trying to be in
[10:23] English major but just to to make sure
[10:25] that you follow what I'm talking about
[10:28] all right that see we we can follow that
[10:31] Lord God all right when you come to this
[10:33] part now that he gets to Exodus and it
[10:37] picks up and Moses has his personal
[10:40] experience at the burning
[10:42] bush okay so then when he does God
[10:46] speaks to Moses and said I am the god of
[10:50] Abraham he reminds him you know I'm the
[10:53] god of a Abraham I'm the god of Isaac
[10:56] I'm the god of Jacob he reminds him of
[10:59] who who he is and Moses says plainly
[11:02] like I tried to emphasize to you a
[11:04] little bit about it that Moses said
[11:06] that's good I I I know about the God of
[11:08] Abraham I know about Abraham I know the
[11:11] records I know the things you know
[11:13] mental records if nothing else that I
[11:15] know about the God of Isaac I know what
[11:18] happened there the god of Jacob the the
[11:20] things I know what took place in those
[11:23] situations but now when I get down
[11:26] there they are going to ask me if I come
[11:30] in and say now I've come down here to
[11:33] lead you out
[11:34] of of bondage and they're going to
[11:38] say what's his
[11:41] name you know all right and then when he
[11:45] says now when they say what's his
[11:50] name Moses was saying was
[11:53] pling I don't know about
[11:56] this situation I don't understand it
[11:59] because I understand Abraham Isaac and
[12:02] Jacob I understand but now in all of
[12:05] that there was never a name picked
[12:08] up even when you go into Genesis you go
[12:11] to Elohim you go in Genesis 2 34 you
[12:16] going into Elohim Elohim means
[12:18] self-existing one but it is not a name
[12:21] it's a title of a name then you pick up
[12:24] Lord God and when you pick up Lord God
[12:27] what are you picking up Jehovah Elohim
[12:30] which Jehovah means like a father with
[12:32] his family but no
[12:34] name all right Moses is simply saying to
[12:37] God I understand all of the
[12:39] situation there but said I want to know
[12:42] what your name is said at least if
[12:45] you're going to send me you could tell
[12:47] me who's doing the
[12:49] sending well he said okay I'll just tell
[12:51] you I am that I am right all right and
[12:56] that's bold italicized letters of if
[12:59] you're looking in your Bible see it's
[13:01] bringing it down to understanding this
[13:04] is one specific situation am as I said
[13:07] when you come over to Lord God of of
[13:11] Exodus I mean of Genesis 2 then it
[13:16] emphasizes the emphasis is placed upon
[13:19] capitalization because that way you
[13:21] would understand that you're dealing
[13:23] with with God Almighty himself but
[13:26] remember whether it be Yahweh
[13:30] Elohim you know Jehovah Jehovah Gyra
[13:33] Jehovah tishu all of those things all of
[13:36] that is references as titles to a name
[13:39] because it's not a name remember they
[13:42] couldn't pronounce it that's right now
[13:44] they could pronounce or make a stab let
[13:46] me make that correctly in this way that
[13:49] I've tried to explain it you could make
[13:51] a stab at
[13:52] jvh you make a stab at it but remember
[13:56] the point there is no vowels except the
[13:59] you part that's used in there so there
[14:02] was no way they could
[14:06] interpret now they could take a stab you
[14:09] know they can make a stab well well it's
[14:10] jvh hu that's that's JV that's his name
[14:15] well we're right back where we was when
[14:17] we were in the denominations and things
[14:19] and you'd say what is the name of God
[14:21] well what do you mean what is the name
[14:22] of God his name is
[14:25] God we know his name is God well God is
[14:29] an object of worship
[14:32] right right and see that's not a name so
[14:36] you still don't have it and brother rown
[14:37] says even when it comes to the burning
[14:39] bush I'll get to this in a minute even
[14:42] up to the burning bush he still has no
[14:45] name now not that he didn't have a name
[14:49] not that his name wasn't present but he
[14:52] name could not be interpreted let's put
[14:55] it that
[14:56] way Jehovah could you know you know you
[14:59] could say well what that's this JV
[15:01] that's
[15:02] Jehovah but it couldn't be
[15:05] interpreted Elohim couldn't be
[15:07] interpreted to mankind right so when you
[15:10] get up here to even to the burning bush
[15:12] then you're still that and he says I am
[15:15] that I
[15:17] am now remember how we emphasized that
[15:19] the other day and I want you the point
[15:21] to remain in your mind because you go
[15:23] back up to verse uh six when he said
[15:26] moreover I am the god of Abraham God
[15:30] speaking personally to Moses I am the
[15:34] god of Abraham the god of Isaac the god
[15:36] of Jacob when he gets down here Moses
[15:38] says tell me your name right if I'm
[15:43] going down I want to know what name I'm
[15:45] going in I I want to tell them when they
[15:48] say something I want to tell them
[15:50] something that they'll realize that
[15:52] there's there's something involved here
[15:55] that we need to think
[15:56] about so he says Moses tell them I am
[16:01] listen see he's saying I am the god of
[16:05] Abraham Isaac and Jacob right so he
[16:07] saying to Moses Moses tell them I am
[16:15] that I
[16:16] am who the one Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[16:21] that's right right I am that I am see
[16:26] because now you're getting closer to a
[16:28] name
[16:29] am you're developing more of an
[16:32] understanding to interpret as reading I
[16:35] saying instead of saying pronounce a
[16:36] name you can pronounce because brother R
[16:39] said there's plenty of jesuses in the
[16:40] world in the days of Jesus there was
[16:42] plenty of
[16:44] jesuses all right but there was only one
[16:47] Lord Jesus
[16:48] Christ there was only one that the Bible
[16:51] said you'll call his name
[16:53] Emmanuel but they didn't do it they
[16:55] called him Jesus cuz he said now you'll
[16:58] call him Jesus because he'll save his
[17:00] people specifically stating who he is
[17:02] what he's doing now that's the emphasis
[17:05] I'm trying to get you to think about is
[17:09] how that as it develops further and
[17:11] further throughout you're getting to a
[17:14] closer understanding of how to interpret
[17:17] the name amen all right because you're
[17:22] not just dealing with letters on a page
[17:26] no do you understand what I'm saying he
[17:28] saying I am
[17:31] that I'm the one that spoke to Moses I
[17:35] mean to to Abraham to Isaac to Jacob now
[17:37] I'm speaking to you said you just go
[17:40] tell them I
[17:42] am but said remember to tell them I am
[17:46] that I am right that's right because
[17:50] remember the children of Israel were
[17:52] supposed to be the people of God and
[17:56] should have understood who Abraham was
[17:59] was should have understood who Isaac was
[18:02] Jacob was and should have understood
[18:05] what took place and how God revealed
[18:08] himself to mankind over the the time and
[18:13] bringing it out that it would come from
[18:15] trying to bring it out as Elohim
[18:18] self-existing
[18:20] now that's self-existing for eternity
[18:23] now we'll get to to the uh when you take
[18:26] Elohim see you get self-existent when
[18:28] you get to I am I am means everpresent
[18:32] for
[18:33] eternity am same as Elohim Elohim was
[18:38] ever presentent for eternity now you're
[18:41] coming down here that you're getting to
[18:43] I am that I am I'm that name that's
[18:46] always been right and the Bible he says
[18:49] there he said this is my name forever
[18:53] amen right it'll be a Perpetual name
[18:57] forever
[19:01] well there's not but one name remember
[19:03] our last week we'll try to pick it up
[19:05] from that thought you remember what
[19:07] we're talking about there's only one
[19:09] name that can fit into this situation
[19:16] amen and there's where we've missed it
[19:19] out what did Brother Rand say about
[19:21] Eve's first
[19:26] mistake he said she didn't believe
[19:29] Hebrews
[19:31] 138 now that's his words Eve didn't
[19:34] believe Hebrews
[19:38] 138 what is Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ
[19:42] the same yesterday today and
[19:44] forever now do we believe it as just
[19:47] trying to pronounce a name or trying to
[19:50] find a new name or trying to find a
[19:52] coded something or how you would say it
[19:55] in the Bible to try to pick up something
[19:58] to get something to make us real into
[20:00] our our understanding or are we trying
[20:03] to see who he really
[20:05] is see Jesus Christ is the same
[20:08] yesterday today and forever that's no
[20:11] con coincidence that it happens up over
[20:13] here in Hebrews 138 and to bring that
[20:16] out to because that's the only name that
[20:19] God ever
[20:20] had all right now we're up to the point
[20:23] of where we're at right the prophet said
[20:25] what he said the only name God ever had
[20:27] is Jesus amen yes
[20:31] amen see then that would make him
[20:33] Hebrews 13:8 he's the same yesterday
[20:36] today and forever remember what we
[20:38] talked about Hebrews
[20:39] 13:7 to consider a man's conversation
[20:43] consider what a preacher preaches about
[20:46] does he preach Jesus Christ the same
[20:47] yesterday today and forever or does he
[20:49] preach Jesus in a
[20:51] way oh in a way he's the same now the
[20:55] prophet said he's he's he's in every way
[20:58] the same
[20:59] name all right so now you've got your
[21:02] Hebrews 13:8 to understand that where
[21:04] you can come to the name and look back
[21:09] here look back here in the Old Testament
[21:13] and follow the opening of the
[21:16] word from
[21:18] God Elohim Jehovah yahweh's all of those
[21:23] titles and things the Jehovah gyus and
[21:26] all pointing to the name of the Lord
[21:28] Jesus Christ why because Jehovah the old
[21:31] is Jesus of the new
[21:34] right Jehovah the old is Jesus of the
[21:37] new all right now when you come to the
[21:39] New Testament part then you could
[21:41] pronounce his
[21:45] name but that's where I love it so much
[21:47] of where that they the way that they put
[21:49] it in
[21:51] there you know because it's in Isaiah
[21:54] that says you you'll call his name
[21:56] Emmanuel
[22:00] well why didn't the angel speak to Mary
[22:03] and say you'll call his name
[22:06] Emmanuel why didn't she call him
[22:12] Emmanuel
[22:15] right she did he did because Emmanuel is
[22:19] who you're talking about Jesus Christ
[22:23] sir why because Emmanuel it said because
[22:26] he'll save his people right have you
[22:30] ever notice one little Point go back in
[22:32] your uh Old Testament and you'll notice
[22:34] something there a little different to to
[22:37] what to doing the word uh
[22:42] Emmanuel is spelled two different ways
[22:44] in the
[22:48] Bible the Old Testament it's spelled
[22:50] with an
[22:53] i the New Testament is spelled with a
[22:55] knee I don't understand how come I'm not
[22:57] doing I'm just ask is telling you don't
[22:59] go and read run in your thing and you'll
[23:01] say well I'm going to run this in and
[23:03] and I'm going to find you know where it
[23:07] says back in the Old Testament about
[23:09] this
[23:09] Emmanuel and you'll find it you won't
[23:11] find Emmanuel with an e in the Old
[23:16] Testament I'm just giving you something
[23:18] where that you can go back in it and you
[23:20] won't get lost like I have you know you
[23:22] you have to sit down and think wait a
[23:24] minute how come this is cuz in Isaiah it
[23:27] says I
[23:29] onto
[23:31] Emmanuel and over in Matthew it says e
[23:37] Emmanuel there's something to wake you
[23:38] up and make you think read your Bible
[23:40] read it for yourself and try to get an
[23:43] understanding out of it read it just
[23:45] like I said read this where it says I am
[23:48] that I am he had just told him that he
[23:51] was the I am of Abraham Isaac Jacob
[23:53] Joseph and all like that
[23:58] and Moses ain't ready to
[24:00] go right but he says now give me his
[24:05] name then The Voice rings back to him to
[24:08] say I am that I am
[24:12] amen Moses said
[24:15] okay I'm ready to
[24:18] go why because he's getting an
[24:20] understanding amen he's getting
[24:23] something
[24:24] personal a revelation of God to himself
[24:28] more of understanding that's why it's
[24:30] not to try to pronounce names and that
[24:32] it's to try to get an understanding of
[24:34] what the revelation of that name means
[24:36] to
[24:38] you and bringing you to that situation
[24:41] all right so
[24:43] remember the I am at the burning
[24:47] bush the Jehovah the
[24:51] old became Jesus Christ
[24:56] am in the book of Acts
[25:01] right the angel of the Covenant was the
[25:04] Lord Jesus
[25:06] Christ who appeared to Moses from the
[25:08] burning bush the Bible says the angel of
[25:11] the Lord and he said I'll send my angel
[25:14] before thee I'll do that it's always
[25:16] talking about this Angel who is that
[25:19] angel he's the angel of the
[25:22] Covenant he's the one that appears then
[25:25] to and they talk about him in Acts s
[25:32] they pick it up and and start talking
[25:33] about this and who it who it really is
[25:36] because his name as I said they had many
[25:41] jesuses they had many jesuses back in
[25:43] the days of the Lord Jesus Christ but
[25:45] there was only one Lord Jesus Christ
[25:48] there was only one that would fit
[25:50] Emmanuel whether you want to spell it
[25:52] with an ey or an e it don't make no
[25:54] difference it's just a point of
[25:56] illustrating and see then you coming
[25:59] down to understand the point that you're
[26:01] trying to find that
[26:06] name then isn't it odd that when Jesus
[26:08] came what did he
[26:12] say I am come in my father's
[26:18] name who was he he was the I am he was
[26:22] Jehovah the Old Testament appearing as
[26:25] the Lord Jesus Christ in the New
[26:26] Testament of the
[26:30] meaning ever present for eternity and
[26:33] never will change that
[26:36] name why because that name is is a
[26:40] Perpetual name that's what your
[26:41] scripture
[26:44] says all right not I
[26:48] was but I
[26:52] am all
[26:54] right so then jvh
[27:04] interpreted now did you get the
[27:06] background or I need to r that again jvh
[27:10] interpreted is the name
[27:14] Jesus not jvh you
[27:20] pronounced remember where brother Bram
[27:22] was at about it when he was sitting
[27:24] there and he said the voice spoke
[27:27] Jehovah over the old is the Jesus of the
[27:30] new remember that's where the squirrels
[27:33] came into
[27:35] existence right keep reading and
[27:38] listening to the prophet that's when the
[27:40] squirrel started appearing the different
[27:41] things happening why because he was
[27:43] Jehovah the old see then now listen to
[27:47] what I'm getting at see then Jehovah the
[27:52] old would have his name could not
[27:56] be pronounced are as I said now not to
[28:00] just try to pronounce it but it could
[28:01] not be
[28:05] interpreted but when it came into the
[28:07] New Testament you could find the
[28:09] interpretation of
[28:12] it because his name is to be called
[28:19] Jesus now remember what we went through
[28:22] there in Matthew in chapter one or two
[28:24] every what it is where they'll call his
[28:26] name Jesus remember they italicized that
[28:28] they they bold lettered that to make it
[28:31] where you would see who it's talking
[28:33] about
[28:35] right see coming from just the name
[28:38] Jesus that would be
[28:42] anybody right J uh jvh I mean yeah
[28:47] Jesus there would be just anybody what's
[28:49] the number somebody pronounce that
[28:51] Spanish name the other day Yus Jesus
[28:54] whatever what it is when you call him
[28:55] Jesus see cuz you got you got the name
[29:00] Jesus but you're not getting to the
[29:04] person that the name is
[29:09] implying it comes to the New Testament
[29:12] and picks it up in bold letter Jesus
[29:14] call he will be the savior of his of the
[29:17] people it tells what that name is it
[29:21] tells you who you're looking for the
[29:23] Lord Jesus Christ amen Jesus Christ the
[29:26] same yesterday today and forever that's
[29:30] right
[29:31] amen his name is Jesus
[29:34] right
[29:36] okay may not click and wake up in you as
[29:39] much but it's your house to me because
[29:43] brother R said on adoption 19 paragraph
[29:46] 184 adoption 1960 The Only Name that God
[29:49] ever
[29:51] had amen right is
[29:55] Jesus right
[29:59] it took all of those years for that name
[30:01] to come into
[30:03] being not to just get to letters j s u
[30:06] not that you get it up every how You' do
[30:08] it in Spanish or Jesus or whatever you'd
[30:11] making but getting to understand the
[30:14] name
[30:18] Jesus I keep saying it that way because
[30:20] the Bible would say he'd be the one that
[30:22] would save his people and things like
[30:23] that cuz it's emphasizing a specific
[30:26] person and when that's specific person
[30:28] is emphasized in the New Testament then
[30:31] when the angel came to to
[30:36] marry to call his name
[30:43] Jesus the interpreters are the writers
[30:46] and things that brought it into our
[30:48] English language to understand they
[30:50] italicized those letters j s u s but not
[30:53] all the way through cuz there in one
[30:56] chapter you have j s us italicize right
[31:00] other words bold letters in a minute
[31:02] you'll have it just regular
[31:05] letters because it's according to what
[31:07] it's dealing
[31:08] with remember the key of what I said to
[31:11] start with on like Lord Jesus I mean
[31:13] Lord
[31:15] God you notice it read it when God is
[31:19] speaking when God was speaking to
[31:24] Cain look at the big bow letters that
[31:27] they've got there
[31:28] the Lord spoke to
[31:32] Cain the Lord spoke to Abel the Lord
[31:35] spoke to Abraham the Lord look at
[31:38] it but then after a while you'll find it
[31:41] in lower case or what you want to call
[31:43] it and it'll be l r d but it' be small
[31:49] letter see that's why the Bible says it
[31:52] the Lord capital l r d said unto my Lord
[31:57] Lor L O R
[32:01] D the Lord said unto my Lord that's not
[32:04] two
[32:05] people to me it's showing something when
[32:08] you're speaking when God is speaking
[32:10] from Heaven it they pick it up and they
[32:13] bring it into Bolder letters or more
[32:16] talisis letters orever what you want to
[32:18] call it in your English doings I'm not
[32:20] the major I'm just a
[32:22] preacher trying to get you to see a
[32:25] point those writers when they picked it
[32:28] up they knew what that meant they knew
[32:31] there was more from Genesis 1 where it
[32:34] would just be
[32:35] God than it was over in Genesis 2 to say
[32:38] Lord God they knew something had
[32:41] happened so you got Elohim then you got
[32:45] Jehovah Elohim do you understand you
[32:47] keep building it up it keeps
[32:49] understanding of the revelation of the
[32:51] name and when you come to the Lord Jesus
[32:53] Christ you've got the name of almighty
[32:56] God he said I come in my father's name
[32:57] name amen glory
[33:02] amen to what would be the father's
[33:08] name Jesus is his
[33:12] name I'm just trying to get you to read
[33:15] your Bible and look for
[33:17] yourself and see the emphasis of how
[33:20] this italicized enough to where you can
[33:22] say hey they made that bold enough for
[33:25] me to understand something is being
[33:27] under brought out in me remember it's
[33:30] not pronouncing it it's in an
[33:32] interpretation or an understanding or a
[33:35] revelation that's going with what that
[33:37] is or who that
[33:42] is is Jehovah the old is Jesus of the
[33:46] new the one true and living God
[33:49] am not no Trinity not no idea that's
[33:52] that Trinity is not even in your
[33:55] Bible well we've been talking that's
[33:58] right we've been
[33:59] taught like Wade was saying the other
[34:01] day about
[34:02] it the devil he knows for sure there's
[34:06] just one
[34:07] God he the Bible said and he
[34:13] feared he trembled he was
[34:16] afraid but then he turned around and
[34:18] taught me and you a trinity and laughed
[34:21] at us and we come out of it swearing by
[34:24] the TR great Trinity of the Bible
[34:28] when there's no such thing he's a triun
[34:32] being Father Son and Holy Ghost is not
[34:34] three
[34:37] people it's one person has a
[34:40] triun understanding from that and his
[34:43] name is Jesus amen now come on did Jesus
[34:46] was he wrong when he said I come in my
[34:48] father's name well that just meant the
[34:50] father sent him
[34:53] down well explain to me how that if you
[34:57] remember when he was talking to Moses he
[34:59] says Moses you he said come Moses he
[35:03] said I've heard of the crying of my
[35:05] people and come I'm going to send
[35:10] you well now how did he send
[35:16] Moses come on what's your prophet's
[35:19] interpretation of said where it says as
[35:22] my father had sent so send I you that's
[35:25] right what's that understanding so send
[35:27] I you
[35:29] what's his understanding of that he said
[35:32] the one that came down came down and
[35:35] went in
[35:38] him it went in him that's how you're
[35:42] sent that's how I born again believer is
[35:44] sent that's what it does it's God living
[35:47] in you Christ in you the hope of glory
[35:49] amen are you
[35:52] listening The Only Name then God ever
[35:55] had would be Jesus to fit the I am to
[36:00] where he could say I come in my father's
[36:02] name John
[36:06] 5:43 and how then he would be Hebrews
[36:14] 138
[36:16] right the same yesterday today and
[36:24] forever when something is placed you
[36:28] know we're
[36:29] we're in English you start off every
[36:31] sentence with a capital letter not a
[36:33] capital word right not a capital
[36:37] word and I'm looking at one here where
[36:39] it says a n d see it's the capital A N D
[36:43] when you English part your when you
[36:45] start off a sentence you start it with a
[36:48] capital but then when you bringing it
[36:51] into the larger case letters you're more
[36:54] or less referring to that person
[36:58] that is being made
[37:02] known his name is Jesus that's too
[37:05] simple isn't it amen but see that affit
[37:09] every scripture there is in the Bible
[37:10] from the old all the way through into
[37:12] the new
[37:16] am now we can pronounce
[37:19] jvh his name is
[37:23] Jesus because he'll save his people
[37:27] right
[37:28] amen he is the Emmanuel of the Old
[37:32] Testament spelled with an i an e in the
[37:35] New Testament why I don't know don't
[37:37] worry I'm just illustrating
[37:39] it showing you that this appears here
[37:42] this appears here then it will help us
[37:45] to
[37:46] understand his
[37:52] name his
[37:54] name is Jesus
[38:02] now when something is placed within bold
[38:04] letters you're speaking of the
[38:09] person you're speaking of the
[38:12] person when it's placed in bold letters
[38:14] you're speaking to the
[38:16] person you're emphasizing or making sure
[38:20] that you're understood to to say this is
[38:24] who I'm talking
[38:25] about all right then you can drop back
[38:28] down like I said you can say the Lord
[38:30] said unto my Lord CU remember it was
[38:32] written in English times to where a lord
[38:35] could be the ruler of a place or this
[38:37] that or the other and God could say the
[38:39] Lord said unto my Lord this is easy
[38:41] because he could be using
[38:48] you he can use you to bring forth but it
[38:52] don't make you him right that's right
[38:55] now are you following me yeah amen I'm
[38:58] trying to preach today I believe I came
[39:01] in his
[39:02] name I'm trying to emphasize that
[39:05] point but I'm not the god of the
[39:10] letter so then if you put my name there
[39:13] in bold letter you've messed
[39:17] up that's why it say sometime even like
[39:20] in in uh there in in Exodus that the
[39:25] angel of the Lord will go it's not
[39:27] always in capital letters probably there
[39:31] not any time used in capital letters
[39:33] because you're referring to the angel of
[39:35] the Lord even though that angel of the
[39:37] Lord is the Lord Jesus Christ what he's
[39:40] doing are you
[39:41] listening what's taking place are going
[39:44] on when God is speaking to mankind it's
[39:48] in bold letters that's right l r d will
[39:52] be a capital g o d will be Capital cuz
[39:57] he's speaking to mankind but when he's
[39:59] using others to
[40:05] speak that you're talking to your
[40:07] children you can be to them a lord to
[40:10] them because you can help them
[40:13] understand they don't say Lord you
[40:17] know but you understand what I'm getting
[40:22] at I believe God came down in the last
[40:25] days used the prophet to bring a message
[40:30] amen but the messenger wasn't God that's
[40:33] right you know what I'm getting at the
[40:35] man himself that's right no he wasn't
[40:39] God all right but he was used
[40:44] yes he was used where brother Brown said
[40:47] it was so close he said the only
[40:49] technical difference was the physical
[40:52] body between him and you
[40:57] come on between you as a child of God
[41:01] and him as God himself the difference is
[41:05] the humanity of where we came and the
[41:07] way we came in and what took
[41:14] place so it would pay for us to take
[41:18] attention sometimes to little bitty
[41:21] ideas that might be able to come out to
[41:23] be something to understanding
[41:27] like I said there where in in Psalms it
[41:29] said the Lord said unto my Lord check
[41:31] that out it's l r d capital
[41:34] letters bold but then they say LD
[41:38] smaller case why
[41:41] because I can say to Donnie my Lord if
[41:44] we're speaking in King's English my
[41:48] Lord but I'm not calling him God that's
[41:53] right he's lower case right he's in
[41:57] God's stad for the time or being used
[41:59] fine amen but he's not in the
[42:05] uppercase all
[42:09] right isn't there something four
[42:12] Services ago I started out to bring out
[42:14] a little bitty point to try to get you
[42:16] to see who you
[42:21] are now did the prophet make this
[42:23] statement he said when the bride
[42:24] realizes who she is right
[42:27] and what she's here for
[42:31] am he said she'll be an invincible
[42:35] Army Satan will be powerless before her
[42:38] when she realizes who she is and what
[42:41] she's doing well what have I been
[42:43] preaching for not five or six months now
[42:45] that's right about the Bride of Jesus
[42:51] Christ
[42:52] right the Bride of Jesus Christ
[42:58] to bring her to a place of
[43:02] understanding like brother brand and I
[43:04] was just pulling up if you wanted I got
[43:05] it right in here where brother BR said
[43:07] you know the godhead is not complete
[43:09] without you that's right amen do you
[43:12] need
[43:13] that you need that quote from the
[43:15] prophet the godhead is not complete
[43:18] without
[43:19] you why because if you're part of God
[43:22] and if you have the new birth that new
[43:24] birth is part of God Amen that's right
[43:27] the new birth is part of God it's part
[43:29] of God living in US you realize what he
[43:31] done he
[43:35] imparted now he's not going to brother
[43:37] Mo said you ain't going to cut him up
[43:38] like an apple passie out to Pieces run
[43:40] out of apple don't never think about God
[43:42] like that what I like to think about him
[43:44] is if you could cut him up in pieces and
[43:45] passie him out as quick as you P him out
[43:47] you'd have another Apple you just you
[43:49] just run out yourself trying to cut it
[43:51] you can't do it cuz the more he the more
[43:54] he reveals himself the more he coming
[43:57] into perfect view of what he wants sir
[44:01] us to be to realize
[44:04] ourselves and to see what we're doing
[44:07] amen well let's just take a few little
[44:09] scriptures and then we'll try to end
[44:11] this series on so let's turn over
[44:15] to we go ahead we'll just use it off the
[44:19] screen go ahead to number nine brothers
[44:22] I bypassed a long way so you didn't have
[44:24] to use all that now we'll use 9 10 and
[44:26] 11 that you can read which will turn out
[44:28] to be uh 1 Timothy
[44:32] 6:13 all
[44:38] right now look I give thee charge in the
[44:41] sight of God who quickened all things
[44:45] and before Christ Jesus that's not two
[44:47] people see amen just showing you what's
[44:50] taking place who before Pilate witnessed
[44:52] a good
[44:54] confession that thou keep this
[44:56] commandment without
[44:57] spot unrebuked until the appearing of
[45:01] our Lord Jesus Christ now watch which in
[45:04] his times he shall s
[45:09] now somewhere through the travel of
[45:14] time somewhere through the emphasis of
[45:16] the travel of
[45:18] time this is going to take
[45:21] place which in his times
[45:27] he shall show who is the blessed and
[45:29] only
[45:30] potentate right now who is that the Lord
[45:33] Jesus Christ right now watch look at
[45:36] that potentate and who he is the king of
[45:41] kings and Lord of
[45:45] lords now if you're looking in your
[45:47] Bible or if you're looking on the screen
[45:48] look bring it back down because we want
[45:50] to keep it on this for a
[45:52] second
[45:54] notice okay
[45:57] little
[45:58] K notice L and little
[46:07] L right who in his time will show he's
[46:11] going to be the king of
[46:14] kings and Lord of lords now we know for
[46:18] certain he's the king that's
[46:22] right right amen we don't have no
[46:25] problem with that he's the king
[46:28] now who's the little
[46:31] case we know that he's the Lord but now
[46:35] who's the little
[46:38] Lords
[46:40] Lord see we don't have time to really
[46:42] get into the message I started this
[46:45] years ago and went for about 60 services
[46:48] on uh making five out of it I'm doing
[46:51] pretty good but if you ever studied
[46:54] Revelations 5
[46:57] where there's a group of people there in
[46:59] Revelations 5 that are Kings and
[47:03] Priests do we need to read that from the
[47:05] Bible the Book of Revelation talks about
[47:08] a group of people that are Kings and
[47:10] Priests amen that's right that's the
[47:13] bride of

[53:59] on and to her was granted that she
[54:03] should be arrayed in fine lining
[54:05] cleaning white for the fine lining is
[54:08] the righteousness of the Saints watch it
[54:10] in a minute later on now and he saith
[54:13] unto me right blessed are they which are
[54:15] called unto the marriage supper of the
[54:17] lamb and he sath unto me these are the
[54:20] true sayings of God and I fell at his
[54:24] feet to worship and he said unto me see
[54:26] thou do it not I am thy fellow servant
[54:29] and of thy Brethren that have the
[54:31] testimony of Jesus worship God for the
[54:33] testimony of Jesus is the spirit of
[54:35] Prophecy now watch and I saw heaven
[54:39] opened Revelation 19 brother brandham
[54:42] said is the Bride of Jesus Christ riding
[54:45] back into the millennial reign as the
[54:47] anointing to the temple now that is
[54:49] Daniel 70 weeks in the message the bride
[54:53] is returning back
[54:57] she is the anointing to the temple amen
[55:00] look and I saw heaven open and behold a
[55:02] white horse and he that set upon him was
[55:05] called faithful and true and in
[55:06] righteousness he does judge and make war
[55:08] his eyes were as a flame of fire and on
[55:10] his head were many
[55:13] crayons and he had a name
[55:21] written
[55:24] now this is revelation not
[55:28] now that no man knew but he
[55:36] himself
[55:39] okay and he was clothed with a vesture
[55:43] dipped in Blood and his
[55:48] name is
[55:49] called the word of
[55:53] God in the beginning was the word the
[55:55] word was with God and the Word was
[56:00] God
[56:02] right and the armies which were in
[56:05] heaven followed after followed him upon
[56:07] white horses clothed in fine linen white
[56:10] and clean white and clean linen back up
[56:12] our a minute ago so this is who the
[56:14] Bride riding back into the Millennium
[56:16] now listen and out of his mouth goeth a
[56:19] sharp sword that with it he should Smite
[56:21] the Nations and he shall rule them with
[56:23] a rod of iron and he threat the wine
[56:26] press with the fierceness of the wrath
[56:27] of almighty God and he hath on his
[56:31] vesture and on his thigh a name
[56:38] written now look in your Bible to make
[56:41] sure that that's right on this
[56:46] screen Big
[56:48] K Big
[56:51] K right King of Kings
[56:57] amen Lord capital l d stays capital l
[57:07] d you remember what we was covering King
[57:10] of Kings Big K little K Lord L O R D
[57:15] Lord Big L little L that's the bride
[57:19] that's what we you I hope you agreed
[57:21] with that point up to there look at the
[57:22] supernatural Revelation now that you're
[57:24] looking at as she's riding into the
[57:27] Millennium she has whatever name he
[57:30] has
[57:33] right cuz she's his wife
[57:39] right his name is Jesus so our name is
[57:43] Jesus right now if he comes up with a
[57:46] new name everybody in the message holler
[57:48] we're going to get a new name well
[57:49] that's all right I ain't never argue
[57:50] with nobody because I ain't worried
[57:52] about it I ain't exhausted the name of
[57:54] Jesus yet when that's true I'll be ready
[57:56] to go on because the next name can't be
[57:58] nothing in Redemption cuz Jesus is the
[58:00] name of Redeemer that's right amen and
[58:03] get that point Jesus is the name of
[58:05] Redeemer so whatever his name is is a
[58:07] redeemer if you got a new name coming
[58:09] that's fine that's all right but
[58:11] remember whatever it is at this time is
[58:14] riding into the Millennium she has done
[58:17] went to the marriage supper she done
[58:19] spent that time and she's riding back
[58:21] into the Millennium to be anointing to
[58:24] the temple riding with him and he
[58:26] recognizes her not as just to be a uh
[58:30] something he
[58:32] chose the other is the choosing we're
[58:35] chosen in him amen we're his children
[58:37] amen Big K little K we're his children
[58:40] we're his offspring now he brings it all
[58:42] to one
[58:45] emphasis bold letter look in your Bible
[58:47] bold letter king of kings and Lord of
[58:50] lords cuz he and the bride have both
[58:53] become one she's his wife amen the wife
[58:56] has the name of the
[58:58] husband so whatever his name is that's
[59:01] what my name
[59:02] is and until it runs out it stays Jesus
[59:06] and I ain't going to argue with you you
[59:08] start telling me well a brother down
[59:10] here has had the new name I want to hear
[59:12] it and I want to see it in the word you
[59:14] want to see it in signs and wonders you
[59:16] want to see if this brother over here
[59:18] they done it right after brother Brandon
[59:19] P off the
[59:22] scene come on I know a little bit
[59:25] brother r passed off the scene there was
[59:27] a group of people that were welln named
[59:29] went over to another man's meetings to
[59:32] see what kind of signs and wonders he
[59:34] was having why did I care what he was
[59:37] having I wasn't there to do it but I'm
[59:40] just saying it that way why do I care I
[59:42] don't care about signs and wonders I've
[59:44] preached that all of my life in this
[59:46] message the Bible says the prophet show
[59:49] you a sign and and it come to pass you
[59:51] better believe it right but now read the
[59:53] other one where he said if a prophet
[59:55] shows you a sign and it comes to pight
[59:56] but he takes you to another God said
[59:59] don't believe him said cuz I sent him
[1:00:02] among you to try you I'm going to try my
[1:00:04] wife brother R said the bride would be
[1:00:07] tried to prove that she would not fall
[1:00:09] like Eve fell in the
[1:00:11] garden where did she fall Hebrews
[1:00:14] 138 that's what he
[1:00:17] said she failed on Hebrews 138 to keep
[1:00:20] him the
[1:00:22] same when we get it to the basis that
[1:00:24] he's the same all the way
[1:00:26] amen you're not afraid of none of this
[1:00:29] stuff going on here no I say it's going
[1:00:31] to get
[1:00:33] worse the prophet said it so what are we
[1:00:35] worried about it but we ought to be like
[1:00:37] I told my wife yesterday or Wade was
[1:00:39] talking yesterday we ought to be the
[1:00:41] happiest people in the world that's
[1:00:44] right it shouldn't have to be that we
[1:00:47] have to tell people and you know I'm
[1:00:49] going to say this and leave
[1:00:51] it I am not going to call any of you
[1:00:56] and invite you to church I told you that
[1:00:58] to start with when this started with

[1:01:11] going to have a
[1:01:13] church on a volunteer
[1:01:16] basis you remember
[1:01:20] that cuz it's like some of them said you
[1:01:22] know will they were to do this with with
[1:01:24] the governor of Georgia they do this
[1:01:26] with the president because of what he's
[1:01:28] doing he's doing his job that's right
[1:01:30] you realize you could tell me the same
[1:01:32] thing if I called you and invited you to
[1:01:34] come to church I will not call you if I
[1:01:37] know you're sick I'll call
[1:01:41] you if I know you're sick I'll call you
[1:01:43] but I'm not going to call you and invite
[1:01:44] you to
[1:01:46] church you're going to come on your own
[1:01:48] accord or not come cuz this is not a
[1:01:51] basis of trying to build some kind of
[1:01:53] something this is a basis of free moral
[1:01:55] agents yes sir amen you say are you
[1:01:58] talking about some of these I'm talking
[1:02:00] about the truth I'm telling it like it

[1:02:06] called you up if I called up brother
[1:02:07] Mark and said brother Mark we missed you
[1:02:09] at church you ought to come then he
[1:02:11] could sue
[1:02:13] me for getting him involved in some kind
[1:02:16] of a deal that the people could be sick
[1:02:18] all around him then he could sue me for
[1:02:21] calling
[1:02:23] him I ain't going to do it
[1:02:27] but we're going to see who's who right
[1:02:32] right cuz we never missed the service
[1:02:35] yet amen right right amen than you Lord
[1:02:40] daughter asked me said Daddy what are we
[1:02:41] going to do I said we're going to church
[1:02:43] amen she looked over at her husband and
[1:02:45] said that settled
[1:02:48] that now that's the truth that's what
[1:02:50] happened I solved that problem we ain't
[1:02:53] missed a service so far amen
[1:02:57] you think this is the the persecution no
[1:02:59] this is the volunteer basis that you're
[1:03:01] giving up your rights every
[1:03:06] day oh they're getting you so
[1:03:08] involved come on they done got you with

[1:03:31] ain't for need nobody I'm making myself
[1:03:37] plain but if you don't like Trump you
[1:03:39] ought to send the money
[1:03:45] back I ain't going to do it but then
[1:03:47] keep the
[1:03:49] money come on I've got some quotes from
[1:03:52] The Prophet where he said keep your home
[1:03:55] and take the of the earth be become a
[1:03:57] Catholic that's the way the wording to
[1:03:59] you all right I'm not trying to be
[1:04:02] anything I'm just trying to be
[1:04:05] honest we didn't get into this by being
[1:04:07] anything nobody's begged anybody to come
[1:04:09] to church to get you to come here you're
[1:04:11] welcome to come here amen glad to have
[1:04:18] you but I'm just pling I'm
[1:04:22] sorry you w not be supplying okay
[1:04:26] maybe that's
[1:04:28] true cuz you see when you start dealing
[1:04:31] with money you going to get in people's
[1:04:33] pocket and you're going to get them in
[1:04:35] your
[1:04:40] hand then let's see how many sends back
[1:04:44] there how is it my neighbor says it he
[1:04:48] he
[1:04:49] says
[1:04:51] stimulus stimulous
[1:04:53] money ain't nobody going to send it back
[1:04:57] I ain't either why cuz I'm going to
[1:04:59] enjoy
[1:05:00] it if he's dumb enough to give it to me
[1:05:02] I'm going to spend
[1:05:04] it that's what he wants me to do anyway
[1:05:07] that's right he wants the economy to
[1:05:09] move
[1:05:11] right hey we get it to
[1:05:14] moving yeah but that's what now remember
[1:05:17] I didn't say
[1:05:19] this I didn't say this but he did Trump
[1:05:22] said it he said make sure you pay your
[1:05:24] tithe
[1:05:29] but I'll tell you one thing you better
[1:05:31] be careful from now on now I'm dead
[1:05:34] serious
[1:05:36] now get you to life get you to
[1:05:38] understand but I'm dead
[1:05:40] serious the Bible said and the prophet
[1:05:43] said he'll come in by flattery right
[1:05:45] don't get caught by all these things
[1:05:47] that's taking place that's
[1:05:50] right it'll come in by
[1:05:53] flattery you're going to invite him in
[1:05:56] amen that's what I said I said this
[1:05:59] ain't the the the persecution no no they
[1:06:03] ain't against it look at what he
[1:06:05] said look at what the man got up and
[1:06:07] said he said if you're going to open the
[1:06:09] bars and the nightclubs he said I'm
[1:06:11] opening the churches and if there any
[1:06:13] trouble he said come to me now but he
[1:06:15] must have some
[1:06:17] Authority cuz he said if you got any
[1:06:20] trouble you come to
[1:06:21] me well I agree with him if you're going
[1:06:24] to open up the bars and the thing
[1:06:28] well brother D we can't go to
[1:06:29] church I'm just
[1:06:32] talking I got a little it's
[1:06:36] 11:30 but you can put on a mask and go
[1:06:39] to Walmart yeah right that's
[1:06:43] right but I ain't going to
[1:06:46] church you put on a mask and go to
[1:06:49] Walmart don't you put on the mask and go
[1:06:51] to church that's right you know in some
[1:06:53] states it's it's against the law to go
[1:06:55] to out without a mask well I agree with
[1:06:57] it we're trying to do everything we can
[1:06:59] do to try to be you know honor to what's
[1:07:02] going on but then one day when it comes
[1:07:04] down to it what's it going to be next
[1:07:07] you realize they were so close there a
[1:07:08] few months ago that if they' have said
[1:07:12] no
[1:07:15] churches you realize that's all he had
[1:07:18] to
[1:07:19] say no
[1:07:22] churches what if he does it again what
[1:07:25] we going to do
[1:07:29] what if they demand we close the doors
[1:07:31] and they make them a storehouse for what
[1:07:33] they
[1:07:35] want we'll face that day when we get
[1:07:38] there until we do we will spend his
[1:07:41] money and enjoy what we're doing and
[1:07:44] have a good time in Jesus
[1:07:47] Christ and serve the Lord because we
[1:07:49] know the end of the story if you're
[1:07:51] listening to what I said
[1:07:54] right we start started out with this
[1:07:56] series in the Old Testament brought it
[1:07:58] all the way through coming through in
[1:07:59] the New Testament wind up and not at the
[1:08:01] end because the end of it but the end is
[1:08:03] the end of the the basics of the Bride
[1:08:05] because she just from there on out she's
[1:08:08] it goes into the Israel
[1:08:11] amen but then we ride back in the
[1:08:13] Millennium
[1:08:15] Amen on them white horses with him
[1:08:19] dressed in fine linen just like he's
[1:08:21] dressed and whatever his name is will be
[1:08:24] our name
[1:08:26] amen you say well what is it I don't
[1:08:29] know there's no need to worry about
[1:08:30] wanting to know it brother R said it may
[1:08:32] be made known when you get there now
[1:08:34] that's the only words I've got I'm not
[1:08:37] interpreting
[1:08:39] nothing I'm just saying that's what he
[1:08:42] said cuz ain't no need to worri about
[1:08:47] it right just be happy and thank God for
[1:08:51] him revealing the truth to us you
[1:08:53] realize what it would be if he hadn't
[1:08:55] Reve reveal this message to us you
[1:08:57] realize where we would be we would be
[1:08:59] just like they are right now around the
[1:09:01] world they're arguing and they'll
[1:09:03] they'll just dump their whole religious
[1:09:04] freedom and everything right into the
[1:09:06] hands of somebody down the road from
[1:09:10] now but what are you going to
