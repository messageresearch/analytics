[4:26] [Applause]
[4:38] but what is that tractor on the mountain
[4:40] brother I said he said one of the
[4:43] threats in one day in history where
[4:45] nation had forgotten God for the people
[4:47] have become formal and different when
[4:50] the priesthood all went with modern
[4:52] trend the prophets prophesy according to
[4:55] the will of the priests and in that day
[4:58] as you they had one man that what they
[5:00] thought was that fanatic you talk about
[5:03] women weren't paint and everything he
[5:05] was carving wall what sort of a God and
[5:09] this old fella had come down and said to
[5:11] the king not even do whose won't a call
[5:15] I'm Taylor call for what become again
[5:19] and we find out then that he had hidden
[5:21] himself and ran away from it he hid out
[5:24] and their wilderness somewhere they come
[5:27] company had thought that maybe that he
[5:29] is start to death her prayers but he had
[5:32] been fed pretty without on water too and
[5:35] there he was calm down and said do you
[5:37] see that I had God sent the Lord now if
[5:41] you're not convinced yet let's go up to
[5:45] the top of the mountain and prove was
[5:47] God or he had another vision from the
[5:49] Lord
[5:50] he said choose you and alter and make it
[5:53] and choose and not sustain them on
[5:56] making an altar of the Lord and also I
[5:59] will put off on mine and we'll both make
[6:02] this sacrifice and that the god this God
[6:06] answered he would have by no means Dom
[6:10] dead if the Lord head and told him he
[6:13] said no later are done this at all this
[6:18] that you command or what's the
[6:20] attraction it's got four hundred priests
[6:22] standing on the hill and the king up
[6:25] there and his chariot with it all of his
[6:27] armor and Garston around and there's ol
[6:30] rusty face looking man ball headed and
[6:34] the hairs hanging down
[6:36] space beasts of ships came wrapped
[6:39] around them tears all over his body
[6:41] standing up there with a stick in his
[6:43] hand and a crucible on the other hand
[6:46] that just said three years and I had
[6:48] before they not even do with Paul
[6:51] Tillich all from it but taken that place
[6:54] of God with such things as halos and
[6:57] shadows and all they talked about
[6:59] and here the old fanatics been out there
[7:02] on the hill bringing all these people up
[7:05] there what was abstraction it was God
[7:08] fixing to vindicate his prophet to be
[7:10] right it was God fulfilling prophecy God
[7:14] also making history fulfilling his word
[7:27] Jesus and the authority of the world the
[7:30] light of the great prophet of old
[7:32] Jehovah's great witness when he had went
[7:35] to mark Carmel call up Israel before
[7:37] Bailey to see which was God he said a
[7:41] Bailey because certain if God be God
[7:45] certain when God not in him with this
[7:49] inspiration give him as vision told him
[7:52] to do things and he went out there and
[7:54] call all the prophets of faith let them
[7:57] make a sacrifice they scream and cut
[7:59] themselves no God Elisha kill the bullet
[8:03] laid it upon the rock the altar said
[8:06] Lord let it be known that our God and I
[8:09] am your servant and said I did all of
[8:12] this that you command shown that an
[8:14] order showed him what to do and he will
[8:18] feel the vision and notice olam bara God
[8:22] fell out of the heavens and consumed the
[8:25] sacrifice he had a ring for three years
[8:28] and six months
[8:32] Gus preparation and so God prepares and
[8:36] sent voices a warning and he's always
[8:39] made a preparation just before we sent
[8:42] eliza up on the Mount Carmel there to
[8:44] prove that he was God and the nation
[8:47] have gone wrong well he satellites out
[8:49] together one and to make preparation of
[8:51] these things and he always does that but
[8:54] provides the way every time for the
[8:56] people and a that people rejected his
[8:59] mercy there's only one thing left to do
[9:02] and that is for his judgment
[9:08] Josefa meeting his burden even Elijah
[9:12] after being the school of the prophets
[9:14] why when he went up there they went it
[9:16] they wanted him to leave he said it's
[9:19] just too straight here you see they had
[9:22] one of these religious leaders of his
[9:23] day and I just separated himself to
[9:26] Mount Carmel what John the Baptist
[9:30] separated himself there
[9:32] I went to the school to learn their
[9:34] theology by Gaza and to the wilderness
[9:36] to preparing for work what does the here
[9:41] and the showed none came and showdown
[9:44] has come again and Elijah up on Mount
[9:47] Carmel when they thought that it all
[9:50] that is the miracles were past there
[9:53] could not be nothing else like miracles
[9:55] there well it was one man who believed
[9:57] it and he said bring up all your profits
[10:00] bring them up here on the mountain and
[10:02] that school see was God loved the
[10:06] scriptures a true sign now upon Mount
[10:13] Carmel the day when he called a showdown
[10:15] and he called a band that thousands of
[10:17] priests they belonged to the temple
[10:20] other denominations he called them up on
[10:22] Mount Carmel State come up here and meet
[10:24] me up here I'll stand the whole bunch

[10:31] he wasn't afraid to say offer up a
[10:34] bullet I'm common being bigger that the
[10:37] God that else was by far be God so all
[10:40] day until from morning till after dinner
[10:43] they jumped up on the altar they Lance
[10:45] themselves they scream they holler today
[10:49] Elijah what that component said I'll do
[10:52] a little louder maybe he's gone on
[10:53] fishing trip or something
[10:55] he's at a pursuit of something for he
[10:58] had thus said the Lord he was satisfied
[11:01] he had the Word of God and their brother
[11:04] and brother a sister what more does any
[11:07] man meet than a promise of God God said
[11:10] he would do as Abraham he kind of God
[11:13] able to perform or his book about he
[11:16] knew that God could do it because God
[11:19] said so confirmation on Commission on
