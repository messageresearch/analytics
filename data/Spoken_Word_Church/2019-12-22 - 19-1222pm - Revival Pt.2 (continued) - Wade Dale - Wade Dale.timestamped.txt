[32:09] heard him a couple of times in Wichita
[32:11] Kansas has a real good understanding of
[32:14] the message it's real good brother so
[32:16] god bless you let's turn to the Book of
[32:18] Psalms and we'll continue our thought
[32:20] won't be very long today we're just
[32:22] going to kind of go through and then
[32:24] bring a few things that we did in this
[32:28] morning hope you enjoyed that this
[32:30] morning we we must understand we're
[32:33] gonna have a revival we better we better
[32:34] understand how to have one amen because
[32:37] the world does not know anything about
[32:39] this revival this revival will be to
[32:41] them it'll be silent but I thought the
[32:44] Bible says their silence in heaven for
[32:46] the space of a half an hour you know why
[32:49] because the world don't know what's
[32:50] going on but you and I know what's going
[32:53] on hey ma'am
[32:55] Psalms 85 verse 1 let's go to the Lord
[32:58] in prayer the only father thank you Lord
[33:00] for the day for all these wonderful
[33:03] singers Lord that you've sent our way
[33:04] father we pray that you'd bless them I
[33:06] know some are going back to another
[33:07] country but Lord it won't be long before
[33:10] we'll be able to convert
[33:12] together we won't need an interpreter
[33:15] when we get in our glorified condition
[33:17] we'll all hear as worse as we're known
[33:19] we won't need that we'll all be able to
[33:22] fellowship and Lord touch each one
[33:26] that's traveling bless the ones that are
[33:29] not here bless the ones that are sick
[33:31] all the requests that you've heard we
[33:34] would Joby's family Lord in the passing
[33:36] of him yesterday Lord he's been a long
[33:38] time in the community a good friend
[33:40] we pray this you just bless each one now
[33:42] take care of us lead us and guide us by
[33:44] your Holy Spirit you have preeminence in
[33:46] this service in Jesus name we pray amen
[33:49] like I said again god bless you brother
[33:51] Isaac and your wife thank you for coming
[33:54] if we keep you we would but you got to
[33:57] go back before you there you go you have
[34:01] to wait a man lease has to tell him what
[34:03] I said so I still can't get this wrap
[34:06] this around my brain I go to the
[34:07] Philippines and we sing songs for two
[34:09] hours in English and I have to have an
[34:12] interpreter when I preach I told him I
[34:18] said if I just sing my sermon do you
[34:19] need an interpreter that'd be horrible
[34:21] Healing the songs eighty-five I don't
[34:25] need any amens to that okay that was
[34:28] just a thought okay that was just a
[34:30] thought all right let's get started but
[34:33] no listen we are weird we're the only
[34:35] people like I said that know where we
[34:37] are coming where we came from what we're
[34:38] doing here where we're going all right
[34:40] and then we see that many things are
[34:42] happening in the message but there is
[34:44] going to be a promised revival but it
[34:48] will be an individual revival it will
[34:50] not be worldwide it may not even be
[34:53] community-wide but it's going to be in
[34:56] your world your own world you're gonna
[34:59] have to have a revival like no one else
[35:01] has had before because you got to have a
[35:03] revival that's gonna take you into a
[35:05] body change all the rest of them was not
[35:08] required that all right Psalm 30:5 one -
[35:13] the chief musician the Psalms for the
[35:14] son of Korah Lord now it's been
[35:17] favorable into thy land now it's brought
[35:20] back the captivity of Jacob
[35:21] now it's forgiven the iniquity of thy
[35:24] people thou has covered
[35:26] there since Eli now has taken away all
[35:29] thy wrath thou has turned thyself from
[35:31] the fierceness of that anger turn us O
[35:33] God of our salvation and caused on anger
[35:36] toward us to cease
[35:37] now remember this is David in the Jewish
[35:40] community they they didn't fall away
[35:42] from being Jews they fell away from what
[35:46] the commandments of God all right they'd
[35:48] fill it they've fallen away from the
[35:50] commands of God because the revival is
[35:52] not to change them into a different
[35:54] person
[35:55] they were always Israel but God is
[35:57] trying to what do away with their sin
[36:00] get them to realize that he's done away
[36:02] with their sin and then watch what he
[36:05] says turn us O God of our salvation and
[36:07] caused on anger toward us decease wilt
[36:09] thou be angry with us forever
[36:10] we'll talk draw out that anger to all
[36:13] generations wilt thou not revive us
[36:16] again that thy people may rejoice in
[36:19] thee because without a revival there are
[36:22] no rejoicing what are you gonna rejoice
[36:23] over yes I'm a Christian well that's not
[36:26] going to get you in a body take a body
[36:28] change that's gonna get you in heaven no
[36:30] problem but that's not our requirement
[36:32] our requirement is is to go on further
[36:35] amen
[36:37] show us thy mercy O Lord and grant us
[36:39] thy salvation all right let's read 2nd
[36:41] chronicles 7 verse 14 through 16 if my
[36:46] people if my people who are called by my
[36:54] name were the only people that know the
[36:56] right name and how to call on him and
[37:00] know who he is and know where he is I
[37:05] want us to hone in on this I want us to
[37:08] know that this is talking about me and
[37:10] you sitting in this building today if my
[37:14] people which are called by my name shall
[37:16] humble themselves and pray and seek my
[37:17] face see what causes a revival humble
[37:21] thyself pray seek my face turn from
[37:23] their wicked ways then will I hear from
[37:26] heaven and will forgive their sin that
[37:28] will heal their land now mine eyes shall
[37:30] be opened in my ears the tenants of the
[37:32] prayer that is made in this place for
[37:34] now have I chosen and sanctified this
[37:37] house like I said before this house
[37:39] not this building this house that my
[37:43] name may be there forever and my eyes
[37:46] and my heart shall be there perpetually
[37:49] you may be seated in the Lord that is
[37:51] blessing to the reading of the word now
[37:53] this morning what we're talking about
[37:54] just for a minute of background we were
[37:56] talking about pull the screen up on the
[37:58] Hebrew lexicon mm-hmm a revival is not
[38:01] talking about resurrection a revival is
[38:04] talking about what you already have that
[38:07] God will quicken what you already have
[38:10] because he cannot quicken non seed or
[38:14] non word there's nothing to quicken
[38:16] that's a direct quote from brother
[38:18] Branham in the church age book but look
[38:20] this is to live have life remain alive
[38:24] it does not saying get life you already
[38:28] have life but you're doing something to
[38:30] that life that you already have as I
[38:32] said this morning I hope and pray you
[38:34] realize maybe you don't have life and
[38:36] you can get life amen but that would be
[38:38] a resurrection not a revival a
[38:40] resurrection is you got to die and
[38:43] Christ come and live in you and
[38:44] resurrect you in heavenly places so that
[38:48] you can walk in the light of the Lord
[38:50] but then as we walk on even Jesus Christ
[38:53] we were talking this morning
[38:54] mmm downstairs even Jesus Christ had to
[38:57] grow in grace and knowledge you and I
[38:59] have to grow sure that baby Jesus was
[39:04] wonderful and in that manger in that
[39:06] feed trough but he did us no good
[39:09] staying in the feed trough he had to
[39:12] grow in grace and knowledge his body had
[39:14] to grow up he had to grow to where he
[39:16] knew who he was I don't think it five
[39:18] years old he knew who he was
[39:20] he didn't have to it wasn't his time you
[39:23] remember the Bible and all through the
[39:25] Bible it says his time had not come yet
[39:27] his time had not come yet he had a time
[39:29] you and I have a time there's a time for
[39:33] everything not not for all things but to
[39:35] all things remember sustain life live
[39:38] prosperously live forever be quickened
[39:41] be alive be restored to life and health
[39:44] to continue in life and remain alive so
[39:47] reviving as the song says revive us
[39:49] again fill each heart with I love now
[39:53] that
[39:53] mean that you need a new birth it means
[39:54] that you need a refilling a man there's
[39:57] many refilling 's we this is all
[40:00] refilling x' we need many refilling I
[40:03] Bob and I were talking a few minutes ago
[40:05] you know you're talking about the
[40:08] mechanics and dynamics everybody's
[40:10] thinking we need them we need to
[40:12] dynamics where's they're not dynamics we
[40:14] need to dynamics you know you can have
[40:16] mechanics and dynamics you can have
[40:21] mechanics and dynamics but where's an
[40:25] area let me have your car keys I'm gonna
[40:28] give it to your daughter your car keys
[40:33] weird you know
[40:34] oh it's Louise's car okay it's Louise
[40:37] yeah look yeah where's your daughter
[40:44] where's your daughter at well that was a
[40:48] horrible example get it okay let's
[40:53] rewind cut that tape off let's start all
[40:55] over again you see what I'm saying
[40:57] there's a car sitting in the driveway
[40:59] out there full of gas which is what but
[41:02] all right the dynamics is to spark but
[41:06] give the keys to a baby disaster
[41:10] disaster that's what God's waiting on
[41:14] he's waiting on us to be mature enough
[41:17] to be able to work with the power that
[41:21] he's giving us everybody got that same
[41:24] am a man so everybody can be shouting
[41:29] mechanics dynamics mechanics dynamics
[41:30] but we got to put a mat or person behind
[41:33] the wheel hey man that's why God's not
[41:36] gonna get listen if brother Brown said
[41:38] you've got enough power inside of you if
[41:40] you've got the new birth to create a
[41:41] world and go live on it Amen cause I see
[41:48] that's the same eternal life that said
[41:50] let there be brotherly the same eternal
[41:52] life you got today is the same eternal
[41:54] life that stood in nothing and said let
[41:56] there be this and let there be that and
[41:57] let there be listener to be left but you
[42:00] are what your withholding from that
[42:03] because you might make a mistake as a
[42:05] human
[42:06] I didn't make a mistake but you might
[42:08] make a mistake with that power that you
[42:10] got inside of you that's my brother
[42:12] Brian said there's a bar what's the bar
[42:13] the bar is maturity but now will we come
[42:17] to full maturity Jesus walked out of the
[42:20] tomb and he said all power and heaven
[42:22] earth been given unto me why he had to
[42:24] go to a process he had to grow up just
[42:26] like we did he was Almighty God but he
[42:29] had to grow in that human body so what
[42:32] is this revival this revival I believe
[42:34] is going to tell us it's an individual
[42:36] revival so what it's going to do is it's
[42:39] going to help us all grow up car sitting
[42:42] there the message of the hour is the car
[42:46] hello the message of the hour is the car
[42:50] got plenty of power got plenty of gas
[42:54] and can't spark if you got the right
[42:57] person to stick the key in and turn the
[42:59] key you don't want to do that you know
[43:02] what disaster would be because you know
[43:04] what you can let a kid they think stick
[43:06] keys in the ignition and they can turn
[43:09] it but Lord don't let him drive neither
[43:14] I'm putting on my car one day at my
[43:17] house and I said we're going to nanny's
[43:18] I said okay just ease it out ease it out
[43:22] ease it out of my driveway go toward
[43:24] nanny's house go this way she goes okay
[43:26] reverse we go that way almost to the
[43:30] railroad tracks
[43:31] I said stop she hits the accelerator
[43:36] Nayla I'm sorry but that's what happened
[43:40] in it you can't see her face get red so
[43:42] she's okay but you see what a disaster
[43:47] that wasn't our look she was an adult
[43:48] almost but she wasn't trained had the
[43:53] complete power to drive that car maybe
[43:56] in the right direction but she didn't
[43:58] have the training folks this 50
[44:00] something years this has been training
[44:03] we've had the Holy Ghost we've had the
[44:06] Holy Ghost since 1906 Azusa Street we've
[44:09] had the Holy Ghost come and we've had it
[44:12] tell us and then a prophet comes and he
[44:15] takes and just opens the book for us
[44:18] and gives us this message but what have
[44:21] we done fifty years we've been going
[44:28] fifty years we've been sucking our thumb
[44:30] going lord help me
[44:34] pastor save my children yeah we can't be
[44:40] Catholic God wants us to be men and
[44:43] women adults even you young kids with
[44:47] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[44:49] right teaching you can become adults in
[44:51] God what is this revival for brother
[44:56] Brown said revival comes from you we're
[45:00] gonna read it in a minute and it comes
[45:02] from when you're fed up with you now you
[45:08] can't find that in a quote but that's
[45:10] what brother Brown says well look when
[45:11] the children of Israel were fed up for
[45:13] where they were they were fed up
[45:15] oh yeah they've been there for a few
[45:18] years and they was okay until about year
[45:21] 350 something Moses you know then Moses
[45:24] comes on the scene then he had to wait
[45:26] another 40 years Moses had to go back to
[45:28] the desert amen so let's take this for a
[45:32] Bible and like I said before brother
[45:35] Brown said revival comes with prayer
[45:37] sometimes also with fasting and what
[45:39] happens is we catch the center which is
[45:41] okay they come under conviction and we
[45:44] catch the center and the center comes in
[45:46] and then there's sometimes a healing
[45:48] campaign going on but remember a revival
[45:51] though is revived what you already have
[45:53] so that God so that God can see that you
[45:57] can handle the word that you can drive
[46:00] the car though the mechanics be there
[46:02] and the dynamics and the ability to turn
[46:04] the key it takes me and you but what
[46:08] does it take it takes reading praying
[46:13] studying coming to church and doing the
[46:15] things you got to do Bible cleans first
[46:18] folks we got to do Bible stuff first
[46:21] if we do Bible stuff first brother
[46:26] Branham did not come to change the Bible
[46:28] he did not come to make the Bible
[46:31] less effective i believe he came to make
[46:35] it more effective he came to open what
[46:38] not just a book cuz what's a book about
[46:40] you your the book he was opening open
[46:45] the eyes of my heart Lord what to read
[46:46] to see he didn't write a new Bible but
[46:52] brother Brown said the Bible became a
[46:54] brand new book why he was reading with a
[46:56] mature set of eyes I like that with a
[47:03] mature set of eyes now let's go to Hosea
[47:06] 6 verse 1 let's read a little bit more
[47:08] from this morning we'll skip some of the
[47:11] quotes I want to get to to this part
[47:14] about revivals s61 come let us return it
[47:18] to the Lord for he has torn and he will
[47:20] heal us he has smitten and he will bind
[47:23] us that listen God will do nothing to a
[47:27] child that doesn't help them he cannot
[47:31] do anything to hurt you you may hurt
[47:35] yourself he may make you realize that
[47:38] you are hurt but God listen God can't
[47:41] hurt you you understand what I mean
[47:43] Satan hurts you but God don't hurt his
[47:46] own children while you walked up he says
[47:48] what a father would give there the kid
[47:52] would cry for a piece of bread and you
[47:54] give him a stone cry for a fish and you
[47:57] give him a scorpion that's not God
[47:59] that's the devil come and let us return
[48:07] them to the Lord for his torn and he
[48:08] will heal us listen I love his
[48:11] omnipotence because he knows what we
[48:13] need but there's one thing for sure we
[48:16] have a free moral agency somebody asked
[48:20] the other day brother Russ called me he
[48:23] said brother wait I can't get this out
[48:24] of my head he said brother branham and
[48:26] your dad's been talking about God
[48:28] waiting on you and I remember he says
[48:32] that an adoption series God's waiting on
[48:34] you and I adoption time where he can
[48:36] fill us with his phone God's waiting on
[48:37] us you know why is waiting us waiting on
[48:41] us cuz you can't go over our free moral
[48:44] agency
[48:45] there's your answer to the question
[48:47] because you think oh listen see this
[48:49] would be us Jeannie this would be us
[48:51] we're God you're gonna do what I said
[48:53] anyway I'm gonna make you do it God
[48:56] can't do that he can't make you do
[48:58] something and be a just God he can't do
[49:02] that that's always waitin on you and I -
[49:05] what he can't override our free moral
[49:07] agency brother Brown man I love what he
[49:10] says about the Holy Ghost he's a timid
[49:12] person he's a gentleman he'll knock on
[49:16] your door but he'll not knock your door
[49:17] down do you know why because that would
[49:22] be making you do something right but see
[49:25] when we do it out of love for God that's
[49:30] much greater than him making us do
[49:32] something amen
[49:34] so he can't override our free moral
[49:35] agency so God is waiting on menu now he
[49:38] knows the day you're gonna come to
[49:40] adoption he knows the day we're gonna
[49:42] get out of here new he knows all that
[49:44] but he's not gonna tell you he's gonna
[49:47] wait and let you call on him that's what
[49:52] the children of Israel did finally one
[49:54] day 400 years or 300 something years
[49:56] after they were in bondage they said
[49:58] finally said God send us a deliverer
[50:01] send us somebody to get us out of this
[50:05] in other words you could go back in the
[50:07] scrolls and say God you promised you
[50:11] promised our Father Abram that we'd be
[50:14] down here for hundred years and it's
[50:16] coming up remember Jeremiah Jeremiah's
[50:18] the same way Jeremiah comes and
[50:19] prophesized God through Jeremiah says
[50:21] you going to be in captivity for 70
[50:23] years but I'm gonna bring you out with a
[50:27] mighty hand and then here's Jeremiah
[50:29] coming up and we see that he wrote that
[50:31] prophecy and then here Daniel was in
[50:33] that prophecy sixty-eight years the
[50:36] Prophet said he had already been in
[50:37] bondage in Israel and he wanted to know
[50:41] what was gonna happen when he got out
[50:44] but we'll talk about that in a minute he
[50:48] will heal us he has smitten and he will
[50:49] bind us up after two days after what's
[50:53] the day - God 2,000 years after 2,000
[50:55] years he will revive us he said
[50:58] the way he didn't know he's revived
[51:00] people all alone but the revival that
[51:03] you and I have gonna get going to come
[51:05] to this difference it's a word revival
[51:07] I'm talking a complete word revival
[51:11] Luther listen Luther had a word revival
[51:14] but it was just on one scripture they
[51:17] just shall live by faith all the other
[51:20] things he could smoke a pop drink a beer
[51:23] you can't do that why because we
[51:26] progressed on that further in the word
[51:28] amen but Luther could do that because he
[51:31] lived by one word one sentence the just
[51:33] shall live by faith then Wesley comes in
[51:36] and says okay
[51:37] we'll take that and we're gonna add two
[51:39] now you can't go to the pub and drink
[51:40] and smoke you got to sanctify yourself
[51:45] do the Methodist and then we see he came
[51:48] on up into the Pentecostal but after two
[51:52] days will he revive us in the third day
[51:55] he will raise us up now obviously that's
[51:58] our day we're in that day right there if
[52:02] you want to know this day this scripture
[52:04] is fulfilled right there it is and we
[52:07] shall live in his side everybody fine
[52:11] with that same n so now I'm gonna read
[52:13] this quote now we didn't have it up on
[52:14] the screen excuse me don't either the
[52:16] rising of the Sun I love this quote
[52:18] because you see what brother Branham
[52:20] says you got it on there yeah okay thank
[52:24] you there was the first sheaf come up
[52:28] from all the prophets which was the son
[52:30] of God the king of prophets there's been
[52:32] churches churches Brides Brides Brides
[52:39] churches Brides Brides
[52:42] but there has got to come one
[52:45] hallelujah one there has to come a real
[52:48] bride not that all those other Brides
[52:50] were false but those other Brides didn't
[52:52] have enough word to carry them to a
[52:54] change of the body we have that now
[53:00] there must come one that's not only got
[53:04] the mechanics but the dynamics of it
[53:07] makes that church live moving the power
[53:10] of his resurrection
[53:11] until we come to that until we find that
[53:14] place what good does it do to polish the
[53:17] hubs and like I said this morning most
[53:20] people don't know what simonize is but
[53:22] all of us older people I had them raise
[53:24] their hand this morning who all know
[53:25] what sign cuz it was actually was the
[53:26] name of a wax
[53:28] simonize and you'd have to wax your
[53:31] whole car and you'd have to wait till it
[53:32] gets all dusty and and and then you
[53:34] would rub it off and you'd look at it
[53:36] and you go oh man I miss the spa you can
[53:38] tell it but that's what he's talking
[53:39] about what have we done we've we've
[53:42] window dressed this message dress hair
[53:47] clothes do this don't do that
[53:50] we've window dressed it when we've
[53:54] missed the power behind it but now sure
[53:58] we've had healings a lot of you were
[54:00] born again during brother branham's time
[54:03] and then on further into this time so
[54:06] don't tell me God's not working God's
[54:08] working okay but he's wanting us to
[54:11] leave this place because we're not into
[54:13] two days we're in the third day what
[54:17] does it good to give her a facelift or a
[54:19] simonize job when there's no dynamics in
[54:22] it no matter how much the mechanics
[54:24] proved to be right there has got to be
[54:26] dynamics to make it work so now when we
[54:29] realize where we're at and realize that
[54:33] dynamics is here along with the
[54:36] mechanics it's like I said this morning
[54:39] some preacher was telling me said well
[54:41] these people they think they've got the
[54:42] third pull and they think they've got
[54:44] the revelation of the seven seals he
[54:47] said they just he said they're
[54:48] adulterers and they live like dogs and
[54:50] then they a lot of them do but I said
[54:52] there's a truth not everybody's gonna
[54:56] have the truth how many people had the
[55:00] truth in Jesus's day one person him and
[55:07] they called him a devil amen one person
[55:12] Jesus had it right now a few years later
[55:16] and on the day of Pentecost there's 120
[55:18] had it right amen
[55:23] listen to this let's go to the next one
[55:26] go to this evil age it is now watch it
[55:31] is that both engaged brides look both
[55:36] engaged brides believe Satan's knowledge
[55:39] against God's Word the Bride of Adam
[55:43] believes Satan's knowledge against God's
[55:45] Word and the Bride of Christ listen
[55:50] folks don't do 2000 years it doesn't
[55:52] matter you can call them whatever you
[55:54] want to but that there were message
[55:56] believers for their time they had the
[55:58] baptism of the Holy Ghost even during
[56:00] that 15 5 years of dark ages when they
[56:02] did nothing but confessed I'm a
[56:04] Christian and they got their heads
[56:06] chopped off that was God they're going
[56:09] to be there we're going to be able to
[56:11] converse with them because they are
[56:12] believer they're on their message
[56:14] believers so we're not belittling
[56:17] anybody but look they're gone there's no
[56:21] way they can help us physically to get
[56:24] out of here only live people and I hope
[56:32] you understand that it's a live message
[56:35] it's a live ministry the Bride of Christ
[56:37] has believed Satan's knowledge could
[56:40] creep sure he did Luther you Jesus
[56:44] Christ never preached the father son
[56:45] Holy Ghost baptism jesus never stood and
[56:47] said there's an eternal hell he never
[56:50] stood and said I and my father of three
[56:54] did he but now the bride down through
[56:59] the ages
[57:00] did because of their own theology God
[57:03] winked at their ignorance because the
[57:05] book was closed and they couldn't see
[57:08] all the truth now you and I can't do
[57:11] that the Bride of Christ has believed
[57:17] Satan's knowledge in this in
[57:18] intellectual evil age against God's Word
[57:21] and notice even the natural that
[57:24] believed that and plunged the whole
[57:26] human race to death the natural bride
[57:28] Adam the natural man of the earth his
[57:31] bride before he got to her to be wife
[57:32] plunged a whole human race into death
[57:35] whether
[57:36] scientific or not but we're talking
[57:38] about this morning
[57:39] people trying to scientifically prove
[57:41] the clouds wrong and all this stuff
[57:42] don't pay attention to that it's
[57:44] worthless worthless it really does not
[57:50] even have a it's not a Salvation issue
[57:53] anyway I william branham open this Bible
[57:58] to me through him like brother Mike was
[58:01] talking about he was that pipe that God
[58:04] pushed the water through and you know
[58:06] where that water went to me you gotta
[58:11] say it went to you but he went to me so
[58:14] I don't care if the pipe was rusty
[58:16] I told deal in that peripheral stuff he
[58:23] didn't do is really any good like I said
[58:25] this morning they got a cloud they got
[58:27] fire they got water out of a rock they
[58:31] got man out of heaven every day three
[58:34] times a day
[58:34] and it had everything they needed they
[58:36] don't have to go to the grocery store
[58:37] with the list
[58:38] I gotta get greens today and I gotta get
[58:40] fish tomorrow and I gotta get no they
[58:43] got man and a God give them free food
[58:45] and they complained they loathed it
[58:51] remember they love it walk out and go I
[58:53] don't want this no more well they asked
[58:56] for something they got it but God God
[58:58] give them something beside quail but you
[59:01] know what you don't do that to God you
[59:04] don't take all that that God gives you
[59:05] an in you want more like that they were
[59:08] murmuring and complaining don't you ever
[59:10] complain to God you ask God there's an
[59:13] approach to God you ask him about things
[59:18] who are we to who are we to question our
[59:22] Creator know all things work too good to
[59:28] them that love the Lord maybe you're not
[59:30] in that group God don't have to take
[59:36] care of the devil's kids he takes care
[59:39] of his own kids
[59:40] whether you're in Holy Eden I'm not
[59:43] gonna charge you for that one whether
[59:44] its scientific or not we die just the
[59:46] same because God said we would whether
[59:49] you're in Holy Eden our Holy Church our
[59:51] holy denomination or whatever it might
[59:54] be
[59:54] you'll die the day you disbelieve one
[59:57] word of God's Word to be the truth when
[1:00:00] it's vindicated and proved to you that's
[1:00:03] the day you separate yourself from God
[1:00:06] not just the whole sentence one word
[1:00:11] whosoever shall add one word or take one
[1:00:13] away that's the day you die now let's
[1:00:18] skip on and see that no that's degree
[1:00:19] number two because I want to get to
[1:00:22] something right here when you see these
[1:00:28] crowds gathering that doesn't mean
[1:00:29] revival so I'm gonna set this up for
[1:00:32] those of you that weren't here this
[1:00:33] morning will tell you what a revival in
[1:00:35] the world the world is looking and I've
[1:00:38] got a I've got a little commentary down
[1:00:41] here at the end I may read it where this
[1:00:44] guy and he's a nominal guy they're
[1:00:46] looking for a revival a sweeping revival
[1:00:50] that God is gonna come in and just take
[1:00:52] care of all this that we got wrong ain't
[1:00:54] gonna take us away from here that's not
[1:00:57] what this is the brides revival is a
[1:01:00] silent revival the bride's revival is a
[1:01:03] revival of person person but listen you
[1:01:10] got to be right that's why he's not
[1:01:11] added denomination right now is because
[1:01:13] they're they have folks word when you
[1:01:17] see these crowds gathering that doesn't
[1:01:19] mean revival that's just the gathering
[1:01:21] but it revival is when people get really
[1:01:23] right with God and pray through and
[1:01:26] starts a revival throughout the city and
[1:01:28] everything they put away sin put away
[1:01:30] their iniquity turn to God turnaround
[1:01:32] start back again in other words down the
[1:01:34] road now let's read number three brother
[1:01:37] I feel real good about it anyway what's
[1:01:39] this church needs today is a good
[1:01:40] revival not in your doctrine not a new
[1:01:44] order just they're stirring up of what
[1:01:47] you already know about listen
[1:01:49] what we know right now can change the
[1:01:52] world but you better get to change first
[1:01:59] cuz it's not going to the world number
[1:02:01] four now Minister cannot bring a revival
[1:02:06] there's no preacher can bring a revival
[1:02:09] he doesn't pack it or carry it with him
[1:02:12] and the only thing you can do is just be
[1:02:15] loyal to God and His Word and the
[1:02:17] revival has to come by the people in
[1:02:20] your home in your life now revival isn't
[1:02:24] adding new members to the church its
[1:02:26] reviving that was what's already we've
[1:02:28] already got to revive means to bring
[1:02:30] back all right let's go to number five
[1:02:32] believe us now this 1951 what we needed
[1:02:35] is an old-fashioned god-sent revival
[1:02:37] clean up the home clean up the heart get
[1:02:40] things ready start a revival in your
[1:02:42] home and it'll begin at church oh boy
[1:02:46] preacher don't bring it into the
[1:02:48] briefcase I wish we could God sends it
[1:02:52] from heaven to the individual walk there
[1:02:58] buddy got that say man let's go to
[1:03:01] number six mothers of old they love to
[1:03:09] raise their kids but all this modern
[1:03:11] America day what we're living in now I
[1:03:12] tell you our nation is simply polluted
[1:03:14] there's not a hope left of this nation
[1:03:16] as I see you know wheat like I said
[1:03:19] before we we hunt with some nominal
[1:03:22] Christian guys I guess you may call them
[1:03:23] that but every time we every time they
[1:03:27] pray they pray for this country
[1:03:29] they pray for the Democrats and they
[1:03:31] pray for the previous no they don't pray
[1:03:32] for the Democrats pray for the
[1:03:33] Republicans they're all Republican and
[1:03:35] they pray that God will help this and
[1:03:37] that's okay I mean I'm not gonna stop
[1:03:40] them in the middle of the prayer and say
[1:03:41] no I bless God brother Brown said you
[1:03:43] can't do that but in my heart I'm like
[1:03:46] it's a wasted prayer he is God's not
[1:03:51] gonna bring this nation back he's
[1:03:53] already condemned it we can pray for
[1:03:56] individual people but not the nation
[1:04:01] there's not a hope left for this nation
[1:04:04] that's 1956 remember he said this year
[1:04:06] would be the year whether they brought
[1:04:08] it in or turned it down well anyway they
[1:04:10] turned their revival down 1956 Lord
[1:04:14] that's been a long time ago only an
[1:04:17] old-fashioned revival and according to
[1:04:19] the scripture it'll never be nationwide
[1:04:21] so then we're just left it'll be a
[1:04:23] revival among the people now look , the
[1:04:27] eat elect of God not everybody that sits
[1:04:30] in the church pew right but it won't be
[1:04:33] a real sweeping revival take the whole
[1:04:35] nation in never was never will be
[1:04:39] alright everybody got that say ma'am all
[1:04:42] right let's go to Genesis 15 just for a
[1:04:45] second we're gonna look now what
[1:04:46] happened was let's read this one yeah no
[1:04:48] go back to that one I missed that one
[1:04:49] I'm sorry I'm sorry
[1:04:51] go back to 7 there more oh there it is I
[1:04:54] got another page let's go down to the
[1:04:58] bottom the bride hasn't had a revival
[1:04:59] yet everybody got that bride hasn't had
[1:05:03] a revival yet all right
[1:05:05] there's been no revival there no
[1:05:09] manifestation of God to stir the bride
[1:05:11] yet yet we've seen signs and wonders in
[1:05:14] this church we've seen the dead raise
[1:05:16] the sick heal cancer go away we've seen
[1:05:19] guns brought back if brother Colley was
[1:05:21] here we've seen purses wherever Amy's
[1:05:25] not here but anyway we've seen God do
[1:05:27] things in this just in this little
[1:05:29] assembly rain be called for rain stop we
[1:05:33] thought we've had all that storm be
[1:05:35] talking away we've seen that but we've
[1:05:39] not been woke up according to the
[1:05:40] brother branham you know why tell us a
[1:05:46] word revival right brother that was
[1:05:49] preaching on anointing once I know
[1:05:51] anyone's can do every bit of that do you
[1:05:54] know for a fact Judas Iscariot cast out
[1:06:01] Devils
[1:06:04] through the name of Jesus did many
[1:06:08] mighty wonders in the name of Jesus
[1:06:13] Judas Iscariot the one that betrayed
[1:06:17] Jesus had signs and wonders so so good
[1:06:22] till they didn't know it actually
[1:06:25] deceived the other eleven because even
[1:06:28] at the night I've been reading I'm in
[1:06:30] the book of John when they're in the
[1:06:32] upper room jesus said John John the one
[1:06:35] laying on his bosom said Lord who is it
[1:06:37] he said the one I sought the cup with
[1:06:39] well he reaches the Bible says in socks
[1:06:41] it and Judas his cup and says go do what
[1:06:46] you need to do we'll leave on the Bible
[1:06:48] in the commentary John it shows the
[1:06:49] Comte says it says you know the words we
[1:06:52] thought he was just gonna go pay for the
[1:06:54] food we read he and I'm so deceived they
[1:06:58] didn't know what he was fixing to go do
[1:07:00] what about today we're looking for it it
[1:07:08] will take those seven unknown thunders
[1:07:10] back there to wake her up again I
[1:07:12] believe we've heard them you might
[1:07:16] listen I have you may not have that's
[1:07:19] for you to decide cuz this the total
[1:07:22] plan of redemption reveal to you and
[1:07:24] that's what the thunders are it's not
[1:07:25] seven minutes not polygamy it's not
[1:07:27] getting seven wives why do they do that
[1:07:31] it will take those seven unknown
[1:07:33] thunders back there to what wake her up
[1:07:36] okay he will send it he promised it now
[1:07:41] if you believe William Brown to be a
[1:07:43] prophet which I do wholly I believe what
[1:07:46] he said if he prophesized if he tells us
[1:07:49] something just like the other day I was
[1:07:51] telling somebody you know when brother
[1:07:52] Brown stood up like 1960 I think it
[1:07:54] would he stood up and he said those
[1:07:56] denominational churches have become
[1:07:58] lodges now folks we went to one not too
[1:08:04] long ago and it's just like going to
[1:08:07] like our art Fela or whatever you want
[1:08:08] else club you know why cause brother
[1:08:12] Brown spoke it that's just what I
[1:08:14] believe he spoke they were lying
[1:08:16] is back in the sixties they can't get
[1:08:18] away from that why would you think of
[1:08:20] profit 1956 will say if they don't
[1:08:23] receive God this year he said she's gone
[1:08:27] now what was that that was the Word of
[1:08:29] God through a prophet their largest so
[1:08:33] their lodges they're not coming back the
[1:08:36] people are good but the lodges it's full
[1:08:41] of dead men's bone but the bride hasn't
[1:08:45] had a revival yet excuse me look at
[1:08:49] number 89 and then we'll go forward he's
[1:08:53] come back to Full Gospel people would
[1:08:54] come one heart and one Accord there'd be
[1:08:56] a revival that would shake the whole
[1:08:58] world every spiritual gift will be in
[1:08:59] the church within an hour's time after
[1:09:01] it took place signing signs and wonders
[1:09:04] that was done by the apostles will be a
[1:09:05] minor thing now this is 1948 and brother
[1:09:10] Branham steps up in about 10 years from
[1:09:12] that and he says there's been more
[1:09:14] people healed in my ministry than in my
[1:09:16] ministry and one night then Jesus had
[1:09:18] his hold three and a half years that's
[1:09:21] what he was feeling he say he felt
[1:09:22] listen being a prophet he felt a lot of
[1:09:25] things coming amen
[1:09:27] I believe he did he's a prophet he was
[1:09:29] prophetic he could see he was an eagle
[1:09:33] that was shaped the whole world without
[1:09:35] hit that was his revival the healing
[1:09:38] revival there brother brown started
[1:09:40] shook the world signs and wonders that
[1:09:46] was done by the Apostles will be a minor
[1:09:47] thing to what we'd do if we could just
[1:09:49] get the church together it's got to
[1:09:51] happen it will happen it may be after I
[1:09:54] passed off the scene but I want to put
[1:09:56] my word in this that you might know that
[1:09:58] my voice is this old Christian people
[1:10:01] bind yourself together with one heart
[1:10:03] and one Accord for God cannot no more
[1:10:07] send the gifts to the church until the
[1:10:09] church while the church is separated
[1:10:11] look at the people in the message and
[1:10:15] I'm just gonna name them one groups in
[1:10:17] Jeffersonville they don't have another
[1:10:18] doing nobody else if you don't just go
[1:10:19] to that place
[1:10:20] or if you just listen to tapes I'm just
[1:10:22] going to name them all then you got
[1:10:23] another place over here that says if you
[1:10:25] don't believe that you got two souls
[1:10:27] you're out then you got another one over
[1:10:28] here that says believe if you don't have
[1:10:30] the
[1:10:30] you say one of me how in the world it's
[1:10:32] got that confused this message is
[1:10:36] perfect man has got in it and messed it
[1:10:40] up
[1:10:41] but until we get everything back
[1:10:43] together God's not gonna send a revival
[1:10:45] he can't I got a quote I'm saving but
[1:10:51] brother man says God can't go to a
[1:10:54] denomination and make a revival because
[1:10:56] they don't have the word because we're
[1:10:59] looking now for a word revival we're not
[1:11:01] looking for great signs and wonders
[1:11:02] we're looking for a word revival a
[1:11:05] revival of the word when Jesus stood and
[1:11:08] said I and my father are one you're
[1:11:10] gonna have to hear me you know that was
[1:11:12] pretty good that Jesus said you're gonna
[1:11:14] have to hear me to have eternal life
[1:11:15] Paul said the same thing
[1:11:20] brother Brown said the same thing you'll
[1:11:24] be judged by my gospel but watch for God
[1:11:29] cannot no more send the gifts to the
[1:11:31] church while the church is separated
[1:11:33] we got divisions factions these places
[1:11:37] in this country that there's a church
[1:11:39] right here and 200 feet down the road
[1:11:41] there's another message Church and they
[1:11:42] don't speak to each other I know that
[1:11:45] for a fact
[1:11:46] okay cuz this church preaches something
[1:11:49] about marriage and divorce that that
[1:11:51] people don't like how are we gonna get
[1:11:56] it together we got to do it individually
[1:11:58] first we got to get it right but our
[1:12:03] problem is as we look at all these
[1:12:04] peripheral things clouds doesn't matter
[1:12:11] to me they're really done we solely must
[1:12:16] put our faith on the Word of God and the
[1:12:21] prophet of God give us divine revelation
[1:12:24] of that word and man I'm telling you if
[1:12:28] he didn't have a vindication there's no
[1:12:32] man was more vindicated than him except
[1:12:34] Jesus Christ
[1:12:35] no man because we're gonna read it in a
[1:12:38] minute
[1:12:38] no man then he can sent look for God can
[1:12:43] no more
[1:12:44] the gifts to the church until the
[1:12:45] churches while the church is separated
[1:12:48] then he can send the Holy Ghost then he
[1:12:51] can let me get that right for God cannot
[1:12:53] no more send two gifts to the church
[1:12:55] while the church is separated then he
[1:12:57] can send the Holy Ghost unless you're in
[1:12:58] one Accord that's right for it came by
[1:13:02] the Holy Ghost believe it verse number
[1:13:06] nine faith want delivered the Saints
[1:13:09] 1953 that's the reason we can't have a
[1:13:11] revival you've got to get back to God's
[1:13:14] faith again in the Bible where men and
[1:13:16] women become born-again and regenerated
[1:13:19] by the Holy Ghost then that man can't
[1:13:22] help from being a Christian he's a
[1:13:24] Christian by birth that's right now
[1:13:25] that's not natural birth that's the new
[1:13:27] birth you don't have to pledge him give
[1:13:30] him a card in other words beg him to
[1:13:32] come to church go visit him ever ever a
[1:13:35] Sunday or two if they don't show up just
[1:13:40] shows one thing not born again if he's
[1:13:44] born again brother you almost have to
[1:13:46] bar the door to keep him out
[1:13:50] amen you've got the cart before the
[1:13:52] horse brother that's what's the matter
[1:13:54] you've got to get Christ first instead
[1:13:57] of the church you got to put Christ
[1:13:59] first that's what we need today that's
[1:14:02] what America needs today that's what the
[1:14:04] whole nation the whole world needs today
[1:14:06] is an old-fashioned revival stirring God
[1:14:09] sent revival everybody okay with that
[1:14:12] that's your prophet telling you what his
[1:14:15] that's his example and I'm gonna skip
[1:14:18] through this so we don't have one I'll
[1:14:19] read it next Sunday because there was a
[1:14:22] revival during Daniels time there was a
[1:14:25] revival during Nehemiah's time there
[1:14:27] were certain revivals that came up there
[1:14:29] was a revival listen there was a revival
[1:14:32] when John the Baptist came on the scene
[1:14:34] it was reviving them from the old to the
[1:14:37] new ma'am
[1:14:39] all right now Jesus really wasn't a
[1:14:41] revival it was a resurrection he was
[1:14:44] trying to get people born again he was
[1:14:46] trying to give them the doctrine to be
[1:14:48] born again so that they could have a
[1:14:50] revival and then they had a revival in
[1:14:54] the upper room on the day of Pentecost
[1:14:58] they had a resurrection but what did you
[1:15:00] do it revived what they heard from Jesus
[1:15:02] it quickened what they had heard from
[1:15:04] God and like a brother said the other
[1:15:07] day now we got people in the message see
[1:15:10] what I mean you got people in the
[1:15:11] message that believe that the Apostles
[1:15:13] had the Holy Ghost before Jesus died
[1:15:17] find me a quote on that one it's not in
[1:15:22] the Bible because my Bible says in the
[1:15:24] book of John about birth about chapter 7
[1:15:26] it says they didn't understand what
[1:15:29] Jesus said why because the Holy Ghost
[1:15:31] had not been given yet because Jesus had
[1:15:33] not been glorified how can you get the
[1:15:36] Holy Ghost when the man standing there
[1:15:37] had it in him and he said go to they go
[1:15:43] to the upper room and you will receive
[1:15:44] power being dude with power from on high
[1:15:50] Pope's I'm telling you if they had the
[1:15:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost and let that
[1:15:54] happen
[1:15:55] that happened to Jesus they prayed to
[1:15:58] let that happen
[1:15:59] no no they did call fire down out of
[1:16:03] heaven but see they couldn't do that
[1:16:05] even Jesus himself being the Holy Ghost
[1:16:08] submitted himself so much to the cross
[1:16:11] till he didn't use any of his power
[1:16:14] none at all you know what he saved it
[1:16:16] from me in you he saved it for us for us
[1:16:21] to use I don't want to go through this
[1:16:24] real quick and then we'll stop and then
[1:16:26] we'll back up a little bit but I want
[1:16:28] you to see that a revival listen hmm a
[1:16:30] revival begins when people start calling
[1:16:33] out for it and they're tired of the
[1:16:37] shape they're in they're tired of the
[1:16:39] things that's going on around them
[1:16:40] Israel got tired of all that the people
[1:16:45] got tired of all these things that
[1:16:47] people were crying out for a deliverer
[1:16:49] they weren't crying out though at first
[1:16:53] when there were no taskmaster when they
[1:16:56] could just eat of the ground and kill
[1:16:58] them a calf and you know but when when
[1:17:01] what when Egypt or the world started
[1:17:04] tightening up they said we need to get
[1:17:07] out of here
[1:17:08] Abram said we got a promised land we
[1:17:11] gonna go to you and I have a promised
[1:17:13] land we got to go to hey man all right
[1:17:17] let's look there was there was five I
[1:17:18] want you to see this every
[1:17:20] characteristic of a revival starts the
[1:17:23] same all right let's go to the there was
[1:17:28] five awakenings starting in 1730 you got
[1:17:32] to go off to all the way over to where
[1:17:33] it says great first first Great
[1:17:35] Awakening brother Anderson Bob oh Lord
[1:17:41] okay here we go
[1:17:43] Bob's my buddy first Great Awakening was
[1:17:48] in the nineteen 1730 now look when you
[1:17:50] see these days this is not from brother
[1:17:52] branham this is the commentary that I
[1:17:53] got got off of the Internet I read
[1:17:55] several of them and this was pretty
[1:17:57] close to what I needed first Great
[1:18:00] Awakening was 1732 the 1740s where
[1:18:04] England and then the colonies most
[1:18:06] notable Massachusetts what churches are
[1:18:09] lacks in their requirements for church
[1:18:11] participation and membership you see
[1:18:15] that word lacks that's what we become
[1:18:19] like some days alone churches are
[1:18:23] relaxed in their requirements for church
[1:18:25] participation and membership it is
[1:18:28] called the halfway covenant and it
[1:18:31] allowed children of non believing
[1:18:33] parents to still be baptized in good
[1:18:36] faith that they'd be reared with the
[1:18:38] morals of the church huh
[1:18:43] God makes a halfway covenant you know
[1:18:48] who made that covenant don't you it
[1:18:49] wasn't God and it allowed children of
[1:18:53] non-believers to be baptized in good
[1:18:55] faith that they'd be reared with the
[1:18:56] morals of the church and that did not
[1:18:59] happen
[1:18:59] remember that church membership is
[1:19:02] voluntary which creates a challenge for
[1:19:04] what is truth and the function of infant
[1:19:06] baptism as an usher into wider community
[1:19:09] citizens you see what they took they
[1:19:11] took from the Catholic Church and they
[1:19:13] still went to sprinkling the babies
[1:19:14] water baptism infant baptism we know
[1:19:17] that's not right who did it all right
[1:19:20] Jonathan Edwards is well known for his
[1:19:22] in the hand of an angry god and so many
[1:19:24] other well-crafted expiratory sermons
[1:19:27] that emphasize the rational appeal for
[1:19:28] faith now this is their coming out into
[1:19:32] a revival look who now that they spelled
[1:19:35] his name wrong it's not John Weasley
[1:19:39] they may have they may have pronounced T
[1:19:41] John Weasley but it's done Wesley now we
[1:19:44] note through the property gardener John
[1:19:45] Wesley was he was the church age
[1:19:47] messenger for that time all right
[1:19:50] he was greatly influenced by John Locke
[1:19:52] John Wesley thank you Charles wouldn't
[1:19:55] get it Bob I don't know if there's a
[1:19:58] copyright on that or not you better be
[1:20:00] careful
[1:20:00] John Wesley Charles Wesley and George
[1:20:04] Whitfield we've heard all these names in
[1:20:05] the message are several other
[1:20:07] instrumental leaders John Wesley begins
[1:20:09] the Methodist movement his brother
[1:20:11] Charles give its music writing 6,000
[1:20:14] hemes Whitfield begins an orphanage in
[1:20:16] Savannah you know that you know actually
[1:20:18] John Wesley come across from England and
[1:20:23] resided in Savannah for a long time
[1:20:25] trying to convert the Indians remember
[1:20:29] and then as brother Dale tells us he's
[1:20:31] going back to England and he meets the
[1:20:34] Moravian people that are that have
[1:20:35] sanctification down bear and he does but
[1:20:37] what happens is God has the mold with
[1:20:40] Martin with John Wesley he can't mold
[1:20:42] with the Moravians because he didn't
[1:20:43] it's not going with a group he's got to
[1:20:45] have one messenger for a church age all
[1:20:47] right so he's that's why brother Brown
[1:20:49] chose John Wesley begins the Methodist
[1:20:53] moving Whitfield begins an orphanage in
[1:20:54] Savannah and it is still there and
[1:20:56] preached to nearly a million people
[1:20:58] throughout the colonies how to the local
[1:21:01] teaching of Edwards and the traveling
[1:21:02] ministry of Whitfield starting in
[1:21:04] Georgia worked up to Massachusetts the
[1:21:06] colonial people are convinced that
[1:21:07] there's convicted of their sins and
[1:21:09] renewed of their need for Jesus and then
[1:21:11] what happens from 1740 to 1820 go to the
[1:21:15] next one from 1740 to 1820 it goes back
[1:21:19] down again they get last they get look
[1:21:22] the moral fabric of society this is 1822
[1:21:25] 1850 the moral fabric of society is
[1:21:28] tattered torn by sin and misplaced
[1:21:30] affections that's a real nice way to put
[1:21:33] that misplaced affections
[1:21:37] they were sinners the desire to usher in
[1:21:41] the second coming of Jesus by saving
[1:21:42] Society provides the strongest impetus
[1:21:45] to make certain my kingdom come Thy will
[1:21:47] be done on earth as it is in heaven
[1:21:49] who started it well here's the guy
[1:21:51] brother Branham talks about Charles
[1:21:52] Finney Charles many offers a fiery
[1:21:55] message of repentance in the big tents
[1:21:57] constructed for meetings left in weeks
[1:21:58] and weeks he Institute's the crying
[1:22:00] bench where invites those renewing
[1:22:03] renewing our professing faith to proceed
[1:22:06] down front and make a public commitment
[1:22:08] to Jesus The Awakening theology is clear
[1:22:11] infinities Escoffier 1 and anyone can
[1:22:14] heed the call Feeny helps to establish
[1:22:16] the Oberlin College as well how whereas
[1:22:19] the first Great Awakening works itself
[1:22:20] through the church the second will
[1:22:23] appeal to anyone and everyone
[1:22:25] you see when that first awakening came
[1:22:27] they were still is a big influence the
[1:22:28] Catholic Church everybody had to go
[1:22:29] still do infant baptism come from
[1:22:32] Catholic but you see how this is coming
[1:22:34] out whereas the first Great Awakening
[1:22:35] itself worked through the church the
[1:22:37] second work to anyone and everyone
[1:22:39] that's what I'm telling you now God is
[1:22:41] now working through us individuals a man
[1:22:45] he's not called a Beth of this church in
[1:22:48] the end time he's not called a random
[1:22:52] Church you understand what I'm saying
[1:22:54] he's called the Church of the Living God
[1:22:56] his children in the end time it brings
[1:23:00] about the temperance movement now that
[1:23:01] temperance is not that temperance that
[1:23:03] temperance is the alcohol movement they
[1:23:05] try to do away with alcohol the
[1:23:08] anti-slavery movement as well as the
[1:23:09] Underground Railroad women's rights the
[1:23:11] Salvation Army you see what a revival
[1:23:13] does it brings thoughts to people all
[1:23:16] right watch the YMCA and sees mighty
[1:23:19] growth in the Baptist and Methodist
[1:23:21] denominations all right let's go to the
[1:23:23] third one which is 1875 to 1885 where
[1:23:26] did it start in Chicago you know where
[1:23:28] this is going Dwight Moody I want you to
[1:23:31] see how many people Dwight Moody
[1:23:32] preached to the civil war ends in 1865
[1:23:36] and with the Great Chicago Fire of 1871
[1:23:38] the vulnerability of humanity is clear
[1:23:41] this backdrop provides the opportunity
[1:23:43] for me to see their need for Christ in
[1:23:45] other words what happened Chicago was
[1:23:48] wiped out
[1:23:49] they needed somebody to come in they
[1:23:51] needed God to come in and help them up
[1:23:53] watch DL moody begins a Bible study for
[1:23:56] street children in the 1850s it grows to
[1:24:00] a substantial number whereby even
[1:24:02] president-elect Abraham Lincoln attends
[1:24:05] to see it for himself now this is one
[1:24:06] guy Dwight Moody
[1:24:07] moody goes on to establish the moody
[1:24:10] church and Bible Institute and is still
[1:24:12] there and continues to preach all around
[1:24:14] the country to more than 100 million
[1:24:18] people IRA Sankey a notable hem writer
[1:24:22] works closely with moody how moody is
[1:24:24] uneducated and breaks out of the normal
[1:24:27] conventions of the church the appeal is
[1:24:30] simple Jesus wants you the way you are
[1:24:31] and come to him now because he's coming
[1:24:34] back soon all right now look at the next
[1:24:37] one we are all familiar with this one
[1:24:38] the Azusa Street revival 1906 to 1915 in
[1:24:43] Los Angeles in the church at 3:12 Azusa
[1:24:46] Street you know what it somebody was it
[1:24:48] worked for me a long time ago of
[1:24:49] McDonald's was from Azusa California
[1:24:51] you know what Azusa means there's
[1:24:54] everything in that City from A to Z in
[1:24:56] the USA a Z USA there was everything she
[1:25:02] said in that city what happened on the
[1:25:04] zoo's our streets parks what we know
[1:25:06] today as the Pentecostal movement it is
[1:25:08] built on the holiness movement which
[1:25:10] focuses on sanctification being
[1:25:13] noticeably separated from the habits of
[1:25:15] the world and as they is a repercussion
[1:25:19] of the Second Great Awakening on April
[1:25:22] the 9th 1906 the Spirit of God falls
[1:25:26] down and several people begin speaking
[1:25:27] in tongues they call it the second
[1:25:29] blessing or sometimes the third work of
[1:25:31] grace the first being salvation the
[1:25:33] second being sanctification who started
[1:25:35] it you have to have somebody to come the
[1:25:37] forefront William Seymour
[1:25:39] daddy Seymour is front and center from
[1:25:41] the disciples of the Charles Fox poem of
[1:25:44] Topeka Kansas and the influence of the
[1:25:46] evening light Saints our Church of God
[1:25:48] and address in Indiana
[1:25:49] Seymour sometimes prays for seven hours
[1:25:52] a day that's how you get a revival
[1:25:57] started for months on end not just come
[1:26:00] in and say one day I prayed for seven
[1:26:02] hours yesterday
[1:26:03] no months on end with an expectation
[1:26:06] that God would act in his timing how the
[1:26:12] revival helps integrate the church into
[1:26:15] a more harmonious unified community
[1:26:17] bringing together rich and poor black
[1:26:19] and white male and female humanism is
[1:26:22] beginning to take root with all of it
[1:26:24] with all that Superman thoughts of the
[1:26:28] future glories of society the Azusa
[1:26:30] revival and subsequent Ewell subsequent
[1:26:33] Pentecostal movement brought back into
[1:26:35] focus the gifts of the holy spirit and
[1:26:37] the unique place of the church is God's
[1:26:39] institution in the world to do his
[1:26:41] bidding and there's a quote where
[1:26:43] brother Brown says he's talking about in
[1:26:44] turn-of-the-century
[1:26:45] why why did God bring and this is the
[1:26:48] last one the 20th century revival when
[1:26:50] they don't have brother Branham in there
[1:26:51] but there's no doubt he was but what I'm
[1:26:55] telling you is there there was I said
[1:26:56] this before and I'm going to say it one
[1:26:58] more time when when man come to a place
[1:27:00] in the at the end of the coming into the
[1:27:03] 1900s cancer and all these horrible
[1:27:06] diseases were coming about and man had
[1:27:10] no cure
[1:27:11] science had not caught up with the
[1:27:12] disease the disease had had went past
[1:27:15] the science man all they could do for
[1:27:19] you and you kind of crazy but they would
[1:27:22] bleed you that bleeds you to try to get
[1:27:27] the bad blood out of you probably killed
[1:27:29] a lot of people but you see it was the
[1:27:32] ignorance of the people what happened
[1:27:34] was brother Graham said Christians
[1:27:36] started to call out to God I love that
[1:27:40] Christians started to cry out to God and
[1:27:42] say God man can't do this science cannot
[1:27:48] heal me God you're the one that's gonna
[1:27:50] have to do it see that's our problem we
[1:27:54] get a little sick go CVS go to the
[1:27:59] doctor go to walk quick care yeah go
[1:28:04] there a couple of times
[1:28:05] it ain't quick and you might get cared
[1:28:08] for but you know that but that's why God
[1:28:10] God you know God's waiting God knew that
[1:28:13] was gonna happen for the
[1:28:14] nice world he knew man was gonna get
[1:28:16] sick he knew but he let man start crying
[1:28:21] out to God instead of God just coming
[1:28:24] down so oh you're sick I'm gonna heal
[1:28:25] you I wish sometimes I do but at the
[1:28:29] turn of the century science did not
[1:28:32] catch up with the disease so God sent a
[1:28:34] healing campaign and I love what brother
[1:28:37] Brahm the angel told brother Brown said
[1:28:39] everything will be subject to you and
[1:28:41] then he says even why do you break out
[1:28:43] cancer because that was the dreaded
[1:28:46] disease you heard the word cancer you
[1:28:49] died but the angel said not even cancer
[1:28:53] will stand in your way
[1:28:55] bringing a healing campaign now what's
[1:28:57] happened now though and I thank God for
[1:28:59] medicine but what's happened now is
[1:29:00] medicine has kind of caught up with
[1:29:03] disease I mean if you get cancer now
[1:29:05] they pretty much cure you by God's grace
[1:29:08] you understand what I'm saying but it
[1:29:13] here's my point it's because man started
[1:29:16] crying out to God for something that
[1:29:18] they didn't have that's what you're not
[1:29:21] gonna have to do we're gonna have to cry
[1:29:23] out to God for something we don't have
[1:29:24] we do not have a glorified body yet we
[1:29:30] don't have that yet oh yeah potentially
[1:29:32] the inside man's eternal I want this guy
[1:29:35] eternal I don't know about y'all but
[1:29:39] I'll be 60 in a couple weeks
[1:29:41] hmm 20th century revival 1910 to the 70s
[1:29:47] American cities most notable in New York
[1:29:49] and Los Angeles my brother Brandon go to
[1:29:51] Los Angeles a lot West Coast the
[1:29:57] Industrial Age is in full force and
[1:29:58] Darwinism is reshaping our sense of the
[1:30:01] value of history in other words Darwin
[1:30:03] isn't come starts coming in there in the
[1:30:05] early 1900s so God sends a revival to
[1:30:09] repress all that so there's not true
[1:30:12] Darwinism it's not true that's the devil
[1:30:14] talking so Darwinism comes out and then
[1:30:18] God sends a messenger Billy Sunday
[1:30:21] much like the revivals before it this
[1:30:23] period is noted for its large gatherings
[1:30:25] and the accusation of sin and proxy
[1:30:28] many of people to the gates of hell as a
[1:30:30] result of their wayward lives who began
[1:30:33] it
[1:30:33] well Billy Sunday did it first Bobby
[1:30:35] brother branham stepped into the healing
[1:30:36] part and all right roll it up please who
[1:30:39] Billy Sunday everybody know Billy Sunday
[1:30:40] we've heard of it his name
[1:30:42] Billy sign me a professional baseball
[1:30:44] player did you know that he was supposed
[1:30:45] to sign with like the New York Giants
[1:30:46] and he was supposed to get like a
[1:30:48] contract that was unbelievable at that
[1:30:51] time but he turned it down to preach the
[1:30:52] gospel because God told him his field
[1:30:55] was not the ball field if you'll read
[1:30:58] about Billy Sunday a professional
[1:31:00] baseball player turned preacher is
[1:31:02] direct and powerful with the gospel
[1:31:03] message beginning in 1907 he carries the
[1:31:05] message to 1.5 million people around the
[1:31:08] country in month-long meetings is he his
[1:31:11] preaches he preaches up until his death
[1:31:15] in 1935 then remember he died and then
[1:31:19] brother branham gets his commission
[1:31:20] Billy Graham enters the scene with vigor
[1:31:23] in 1949 with his Los Angeles Crusades
[1:31:25] about the same time you know brother
[1:31:26] Martin starts in 48 that catches the
[1:31:29] attention of the press he goes on to
[1:31:31] hold more than 400 Crusades in 185
[1:31:33] countries attracting arena sized crowds
[1:31:36] and broadcasting many Crusades on
[1:31:38] television then while add what we know
[1:31:40] is his brother branham came up during
[1:31:42] that time and had a healing campaign
[1:31:44] like no other but what happened there's
[1:31:46] a lot of people fall fell into that and
[1:31:48] try to copycat it but remember whatever
[1:31:51] even in God's journals they'll tell you
[1:31:53] that brother Branham was the founder of
[1:31:56] the healing campaign they don't doubt
[1:31:58] that now they said later on he went off
[1:32:00] and you know got off the word we know
[1:32:02] let's just allow the devil but say
[1:32:05] everybody puts him I guess except this
[1:32:08] guy but Sunday and grammar' two of many
[1:32:10] who see the fraying of culture both
[1:32:12] before the wars and certainly after
[1:32:14] World War two but I want to tell you
[1:32:16] something as powerful as they were they
[1:32:17] never changed anything the world kept
[1:32:21] getting worse same way now brother Brown
[1:32:23] didn't change anything he changed
[1:32:24] individual people he didn't come to
[1:32:27] change a nation he didn't come to shape
[1:32:30] a denomination he didn't come to shape
[1:32:32] something so that we can all get in this
[1:32:34] big circle he come to shape individuals
[1:32:38] for the glory of God not not not group
[1:32:42] individuals they represented the
[1:32:45] preaching arm of revival Francis Buckman
[1:32:48] who began the Oxford group and
[1:32:49] Alcoholics Anonymous Robert Pierce that
[1:32:51] founds World Vision and Samaritan's
[1:32:52] Purse
[1:32:53] which now Samaritans purchased purse is
[1:32:55] taken over by the Graham Foundation
[1:32:56] represent the social armored revival
[1:32:59] Graham's work is careful to work with
[1:33:00] local churches the outgrowth of the
[1:33:02] movement is not isolated but designate
[1:33:04] it to be stimulus a stimulus for strong
[1:33:07] church participation in the discipleship
[1:33:09] but then you got brother Branham and
[1:33:11] I'll bring a quote a couple of Sundays
[1:33:13] from now where brother Brown says he
[1:33:16] interviewed Billy Graham said he don't
[1:33:17] have thirty thousand converse and go
[1:33:19] back to find thirty five now that's
[1:33:21] depressing you know why cuz he wasn't
[1:33:24] getting them to Christ he was getting
[1:33:28] them to a feeling or any emotion brother
[1:33:32] Branham wasn't doing that he was getting
[1:33:33] the people to Christ there's a wealth of
[1:33:37] information out there but each of these
[1:33:38] five great revivals watch this more than
[1:33:40] could be addressed in this blog post
[1:33:41] God's work is not isolated but sometimes
[1:33:44] we see it concentrated around specific
[1:33:46] places and people like in the case of us
[1:33:50] could God be working toward a revival
[1:33:52] now no except for us know may our hearts
[1:33:57] and minds be open may our posture be
[1:33:59] prayer may our hope being the Living God
[1:34:01] who will seek and save those who are
[1:34:02] lost
[1:34:03] may we be his instruments now that's the
[1:34:06] guy a nominal guy they had a real good
[1:34:09] commentary about the revival but he
[1:34:15] never mentioned the message of the alum
[1:34:18] he never mentions William Branham we
[1:34:22] know something he don't know we know
[1:34:25] that God sent a prophet he sent a
[1:34:28] prophet that began as a worldwide
[1:34:30] revival of a healing campaign what about
[1:34:33] brother Brown said he said I went to one
[1:34:35] place what was it he prayed for people
[1:34:37] and he'd get tired and laid down on a
[1:34:39] cot on the pulpit and then get back up
[1:34:42] and pray for 20,000 people go back and
[1:34:45] lay back down a cot not to eat for three
[1:34:47] days he gave his life for that but you
[1:34:50] know what that kept dwindling away
[1:34:51] though that went from thirty thousand to
[1:34:54] three thousand from
[1:34:55] thousand to 300 from 300 to thirty why
[1:34:58] because he brought the word he brought
[1:35:01] the word pure and unadulterated sure he
[1:35:04] threw the net out there when the
[1:35:05] musicians come he threw the net out
[1:35:08] there when when he was preaching to
[1:35:10] Baptists and Methodists and Pentecostals
[1:35:12] but buddy I'm telling you in 1962 when
[1:35:18] he preached his spoken words original
[1:35:19] seed he said thousands of my friends
[1:35:21] will leave me why because he brought it
[1:35:24] down to one seed and that was what the
[1:35:29] original was not some hybrid he called
[1:35:32] him hybrid he preached hybrid religion
[1:35:34] listen there's nothing wrong with
[1:35:36] denominational people they're good
[1:35:38] people there's some good they some
[1:35:39] people outshine us in the denominational
[1:35:41] world but they can't have a word revival
[1:35:44] you and I are the only people that can
[1:35:47] have a word revival because we have the
[1:35:50] word pure and unadulterated estándar our
[1:35:55] feet listen folks we can't lose there's
[1:36:04] gonna revival be started by somebody
[1:36:08] individuals it's why can't it be us you
[1:36:10] like I said you'd say well I don't see
[1:36:13] anything see believe believe it in you
[1:36:19] will see pray for a revival here we come
[1:36:24] up to a new year we make all these new
[1:36:26] year's resolution we eat ourselves to
[1:36:28] gain 20 pounds and then we we make a
[1:36:31] resolution in January to lose that same
[1:36:32] 20 pounds if we just not gained it in
[1:36:36] the first place we wouldn't had to make
[1:36:37] that resolution in that right skinny gal
[1:36:42] that stands back then 20 years old yeah
[1:36:44] you can maybe not getting 20 pounds but
[1:36:47] some of us some of us look at food gain
[1:36:49] treatments as we get older but to
[1:36:54] revival will start when you get serious
[1:36:57] we're going to open the weave I believe
[1:36:59] we're gonna weave open the door to tell
[1:37:02] you how we'll have a few more sermons on
[1:37:05] it but if you'll notice every every
[1:37:09] every revival started when people got
[1:37:12] tired of the status quo they got tired
[1:37:15] of what they were living under during
[1:37:17] the time that they were there Israel
[1:37:21] John the Baptist came because there was
[1:37:24] a call out of the Old Testament to come
[1:37:28] into the new there was a call for a
[1:37:35] group of people to come out of a
[1:37:36] Catholic Church till they were tired of
[1:37:38] dealing with what the Hail Marys in the
[1:37:40] oh god said Martin Luther didn't get him
[1:37:45] all the way out but he sent Martin
[1:37:47] Luther to have a revival but you and I
[1:37:50] our revival he's gonna happen inside of
[1:37:54] you but I hope and pray there's like a
[1:38:00] pressure cooker you know you got them
