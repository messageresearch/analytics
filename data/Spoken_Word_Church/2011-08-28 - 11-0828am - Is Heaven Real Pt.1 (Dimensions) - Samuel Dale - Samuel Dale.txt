shake hands with one another cuzz that's who you're looking at you're looking at God living in the earth so you can see him good to see everybody in the house of the Lord you like turn in scriptures we have three readings turn with us we be going from 1 Peter 3 Revelation 6 in 1 Timothy 6 now remember the Lord willing the Bible study will be coming this coming Saturday I've had it messed up all this whole week I've been trying my best to get to Bible study even yesterday I said we got to get ready to go you and it's just I've been off a whole week somewhere I don't know where I gained one or lost one I haven't figured it out you but anyhow so just uh remember that Bible study we're on just what you call general questions and so come and be with us and have a good time in the Lord now remember that brother Fred Hooper he's a wonderful brother used to be with us for many many years here and he passed away this past week and they will be having viewing tomorrow night there in it's somewhere around kenstone but you you'll find words that and uh then the funeral will be on Tuesday at 11: they've asked me to speak a little bit because you know being such great friends with him over the years and he was a wonderful brother good little brother and I wait and I got to go down and be with him about a month month ago and pray for him and and all passed on so just remember the family pray for them that the Lord would would be with each one you've got the scriptures up there but we'll read them off and everything so uh you let's see I reckon that all announcements I'm supposed to make uh the Lord willing uh my wife and I will be gone the weekend of the 10th up to brother Richards for the weekend to ministering to him and I think Wade and Jun will be gone then the next weekend which is the fellowship meet weekend but uh you know we'll see how it works all right so uh First Timothy I be 1 Peter 3 Revelation 6 1 Timothy 6 Heavenly Father we thank you for your love and your grace we thank you for this day that we live thank you for Calvary thank you for everything we pray that you would just bless us now with your presence as we try to talk about you that you would come on the scene and speak through our hearts and our Liv lives that Lord you would reveal yourself unto us and Lord the main thing that we're trying to do right now is to find out reality of all things that we see that all things are becoming more real unto us and as they become more real unto us it means it's drawing us to a place to where that we can step over into the reality of what we need to have just guide us forgive our sins lead us bless the Hooper family there in the loss of bread and Lord just have your way with each one use us to speak what you'd have to be said in Jesus name amen amen okay first first Peter I could turn and read it off of that but I'd rather use my scriptures amen you 1 Peter 3 18-2 for Christ also who hath once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit that's right by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison number two go over to Revelations 6:9 and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long how long holy and true does thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their Brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled all right now go back to First Timothy 6 talking about the period of the Lord Jesus Christ which in his times he shall show who is the blessed and only potentate the king of kings and Lord of Lord who only hath immortality dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto whom no man has seen nor can see y to whom be honor and power Everlasting amen you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've got a lot of lot of the same yeah these two are the same no problem you will see the drawings are different and we will be using them toh go through it but what I want you to see today is we're going to talk about I'm trying my best to get you and me me especially thank you brother to see the real reality of things instead of just you know looking around and seeing what we see here and and all like that and thinking that uh these things are real well they are but just remember like the the earthquake the other day you know that they fell all across the whole uh I guess you call it the Eastern side of the United States right you know you can think well now if you'd have been standing down on Stone Mountain you know you know that rock would have been moving because it's so uh you know so much and they claimed it actually right around the cores and the thought the parts of an earthquake that is just like jelly and you know the the sand that everything just becomes Sandy just this there nothing holding but see we think this is real we think we beat on a a something made from wood and we think it's real and we think that uh the great things that have been made the great skyscrapers and things that have been made out of you know huge metal but we see that two planes fly in and there burns down a building and things cuz there's nothing here that's permanent it's just a temporary thing but yet all of the the Realms of God are more real than the realm that we live in right that's what I'm want you to see I'm wanting you to to try to to understand a little more about uh re ity you know as I've always tried to talk to you about you know saying that uh we say God is Elohim self-existing well I guess one day there was just nothing whatsoever and just a you know there and just and he was just floating around like a glob and and just you know some kind of a something that we can't fathom with our own understanding well I don't see why we can't not you know I don't see why we can't understand now when the prophet of God has brought us the message to show us the scriptures that were already there in the scriptures and and you know the things and just doing that but I'm I'm warning it on your mind about how real everything is and that's what I want you to do today with me stick with me as we try to go up through the dimensions and remember that each Dimension you travel into is greater than the dimension that you're living in right see if if you don't get nothing else out of the message today that's what I want you to see that see as we move in and talk about the fourth dimension well you've heard the prophet say it but see we we just it just blows our mind and we don't even try to think about it we say I don't want to get in them deep things I'll get all messed up don't worry about getting in the Deep things getting messed up you already messed up that's right we born messed up it's just plain language that's you know no need of playing with anything just be straight and honest about it and you know and we we look into things and we talk about uh seeing God and I've asked you many times the question is your God real or is it just some thought is it just some concept or some idea that you have something in your mind that you've you've made up and and and well brother Dale I just can't see he's real I've even been accused of making him too real now if if that's all I got to face god with when this thing is over with then I'll be glad to go to hell for 10 billion years on that one thing to try to get people to see that God is real CU what are you going to think about him is he you know you mean he brought you and I into being but he's not greater than we are right see then that way you make the creation which is US greater than the Creator see and and don't do that get it all into to something that you can look at now we're going to talk about the dimensions we've been through this many times in the years past and and the brothers here has covered it real good and but I read you three different three scriptures covering uh three different dimensions all right and the one is Jesus going to hell to to the spirits in prison all right the next is is to going up to see the souls under the altar which is the fifth seal Jew and and all of that and then we went into Timothy to show that there is a position or place that Jesus is in that no man have approached unto that position yet all right and and doing that then that's three different dimensional things okay and and I there's a quote on the back of your your notes on one of them and I don't know where Richard can grab that one I just gave them to them while ago but it's on the back of one of your notes it was an addition so I thank God for brother Joe and brother Richard we we've been working three days on trying to get some things together to be able to do it but there's a message on the the breach which would come on down to the LIC and if he doesn't have to put it on there but if he does yeah all right he talking about see and here is here he is as a mediator on the altar just a little longer until there's more has to suffer like you but now he comes from here at this life seal he's no more mediator he's King now and what does he do and if he's King he has to have subjects and his subjects is them that he has redeemed and they cannot come before him until he takes the rights of Redemption then he walks forth see so then there is a place there that that we've talked about that no man can approach to immortality because immortality is signifying eternal life in a mortal being right it is not talking about just spiritual matters it's not talking about theophanies or or anything it's talking about uh an immortality of a of a doing and and that's where we want to cover it to try to see but the word dimension it says Webster says it's a magnitude measured in a particular direction or along a diameter or principal axis another words it's a measurement of width length height right see it simply means a measuring of a particular thing or the scope of it that's really what a dimension is talking about Cor in other words it's a it's not to say call it a cubicle but that's the best way of thinking because it's length width height breadth Etc you know and and we deal with those things so that is a dimension but what I want you to see is when we get through that these Dimensions so overlay each other until they're right here right because you remember the Lord Jes Jesus standing there one day and he said the son of man which is in heaven right well you know he evidently knew what he was talking about but he had the ability to be able to be in both places right right and understand and and I think that it will help us as we go along because what I'm get it again now as we go up through the mentions remember the next Dimension above what we're talking about is greater than than this Dimension you said no no it's not cuz we're here where we're we we going do no but it's greater because it has the controlling effect upon this Dimension the fourth dimmension is controlling factor of this Dimension right all right and see then you move up to the fith to the center dead we see then that would you know the the the people and then when you would go from dark to the sixth Dimension be the Christian dead well wouldn't you want make sure that they're more greater than we are right I mean what would be the reason why we wouldn't want to to come to a reality cuz remember you can think what you want to I have the drawing already made Joe's worked on it that you're going to see something one of these days that that the Lord willing from just a drawing that you're going to see how everything can come right back down here and and and and all but now I want you to get this point this is the key to to understand what I'm saying a a dimension it is a geographical a place whatever you know that you want to talk about whatever you want to make it you make it what you want to make your your point of seeing what a dimension is but a dimension always will have a limitation it's limited to that Dimension we can't go to the next one right right it's something that we can't do now God could take a profit sure and go through right but Dimensions is the things that you cannot you they can never be done away with no Dimension will ever be done away with now I'm saying this ahead of time so that you'll you'll listen to the message as that go along but see a dimension will always signify a holding area a position a place or a time whatever you want to call it that's why there's only seven dimensions right all right I'm going putting it in here to start with where that anybody hears it then I come back and say things then they can't come along and say well I didn't under now see we'll get to it this evening the Bible speaks of the heavens of the heavens I believe Heaven is more real than we consider it to be and listen Heaven that I'm talking about not the atmospheres cuz they can be called out we will cover these things the you look at your drawing you see on the side that that it says Heaven because heaven can signify atmospheric up from ground up to so far and then you got stratop feres and all kind of spheres that goes out to where that it gets to where you can't breathe and and all kind of things and the layers going up but then you got heaven and Heavenly and then you got the heaven heaven of Heavens all right Heaven that I'm talking about now not to the dimensional situation down here not as we travel Heaven never had a beginning right sure it will never have an ending right Heaven is eternal it is not a dimension right you cannot make Heaven that I'm speaking of a dimension that's right amen because when you try to say it's a dimension you're squaring it off all right everybody understand you might not understand what I'm talking about but do you understand my word yes all right then we will get back to that in maybe 10 messages down the road I'm not worried about it because I want you to see what we're talking about but as I said we read here in the scripture of three different dimensions three different positions right see hell is you know Jesus going sold under the altar under the Sixth Seal and then on up into the seventh Dimension where that Jesus is and uh so watch these as we go along and and then it will help to to understand what I'm trying to say about it being real so remember a dimension is like a thing that can be here and it's around us but we can't see it right something has to happen to our natural eyes to be able to do I I can't stand here and watch people go through this building right right but but if we had a television and set it right there it would show you that that's what's taking place right all right now you remember as a dimension to try to show you to help you you remember that when Lazarus died he went to what would be called the bosom of Abraham which is a place provided by the faith of Abraham not a big old belly that he's got and he wanted somebody to go back and help his brothers right in things but the Bible says there's a great Guth fixed even though that you could stand the one describing could stand and describe what they were seeing they could not cross that Chasm so keep that in mind now we're put scriptures in to where that you don't run off and say well that's just your idea or opinion see it is what the Bible is saying all right so then study that with me now as dimensions and remember in Bible terminologies it means a place or position that is different from the other positions or you would not have seven dimensions all right now see we don't have to take just the words of science but science can prove some of the dimensions I remember reading many many years ago and and I don't understand all of this about the radio waves and the things and all but I remember many many years ago that they said that that they believe they would come a day that they would be able to tap into hell and listen to the people well how close is it getting that's right when that what is her name that got killed over there the lady in the and you know the big princess or something Diana when you know now I know it was on the phone but don't get it don't get it all messed up you know they went back and pulled all of that and they could hear her voice they could still hear her voice see those dimensions are there we just don't know how to tap in and science has been able to tap in to a certain degree and can show these things all right so where do we live at now I'm trying to get a point to watch just some scriptures coming down to where that you'll see the and see it's it's backed up like I said John 3:13 where the son of man which is in heaven nourished it on Earth see it was possible for him being who he was to be in both dimensions at the same time right but now by way of the Prophet messenger and what we can read from science because we believe what they they say we can go through these things to to break down some of the things that we we talk about and and and you know to to be in a understand reality now I gave you a quote from Brother brandom Where that he said on paragraph 110 Souls that are in prison 63 that he believed he had been in both places now here's where we got to cover something because you're going to I don't want to leave leave any loophole see people's computer mind clicks real you mean brother Brown went to hell you say brother Brown he said he did that's up to you right now whether he went there as a person I do not think so that's my personal opinion but he went there as a Visionary you know some way that God could use him because he was a prophet he said I've been in both places right he said I've seen the redeemed the Blessed I've seen the Lost yep in where they were at yep now what about a prophet of God that could travel in those things and be able to see these things and be in totally two different dimensions through the ability of being a prophet of God like I said now I don't believe he went to hell as a thing but he did tell us that it's not burning sir he said that'd be a pleasure so it's not what we think about see we want to put things and just we just lock our mind I don't care what you say cuz you know brother Brown never went to hell but I didn't say he did CU we'll get to it in a little while when he talks about the sixth dimension in heaven and things and he said I didn't say I went right so then that's the way you're going to have to cover it to to do to be able to to handle but now let's just look at these Dimensions brother Joe and them done a wonderful job pulling off let's use the first one on this one and then we'll read it and you keep these now because we're going to be referring back to these all right maybe not necessarily the quotes we have but these that we printed off we're going to be referring back and you'd be surprised how long it took to get that down into to what I wanted because this is the way it was and I I'm not throwing off on nobody it was upside down to compared the way I wanted it because what it done it took one dimension and went down to seven see I told her Jo and them first up front I said I don't want it I said because there is no such thing other only thing you could go is down and I know you're going down if you're not saved I know that I know the quotes in the Bible but yet we've got to talk about a Christian so we don't want one going down I don't think the seven dimensions going down but we turned it over to be able to bring it to place that we could see that you know right here we can understand and let your Prophet answer these things now watch him it's off of the message uh present stage of my Ministry 1962 uh 9008 that's number uh would be number two on your notes now when we come along we remember that we live here in three dimensions I don't know whether I can name them or not one of them is light the other is matter Tommy you remember what the third is someone says something the editor huh Adam somebody must have said Adam Adam someone else says time time right now light matter and time we use I like Life Light matter because that's just held over from the old school days and and the things it's the same thing all right and our five senses contact them Dimensions because that's actually we live in the third dimension which would mean that you could break it down to a one dimension is life one dimension is time and one dimension is matter you can break it on down we don't care to do that we're care to just go along to show you where we're living all right if you see the drawing it's got the caste feel smelling here on it that I like that and because that's where you know that's where we're dwelling at is where we're at here we're controlled by those things but now I going keep saying this see we think those things are more real well then what keeps you alive when you go to sleep right amen what what happens in a dream right what happens in a vision uh you know what happens in those things the Y and and I tried to cover there the other day where the Prophet was talking about how that that our and we'll get back to it a little bit in the fourth dimension that our dreams a lot of times being nightmares because that we're we're Hy we're between the conscious and the subconscious and see we can't connect with brother brandom see his conscious and subconscious the doctors even said said we don't understand said you could dream a dream while you're standing Wide Awake said because your subconscious your conscience is together well see us human Mortals are not made that way that God made that as a gift you know and and and I like that but all right do you understand what I'm talking about we live in what is called the third dimension which is light light time you know matter uh we'll give you a quot to brother ROM in a minute where he even covers thoughts and and different things but here we're living in this we think this is so real and thank God for it cuz this is where we began our Earthly journey and that's why it'll never be annihilated I told you when when I'm finished with this if I do it you tell me I did there'll be none of these Dimensions will be annihilated none of these Dimensions will be annihilated but they will be incorporated into eternal life that's right you know all right see because that's what I think about eternal life that's what I think about God and how real he is he's just not some thought I mean to me he's a person amen he's not just well Jesus is one person God's no we can't go that way we supposed to be away from that trinitarian concept that's right and surely we can understand but all right let's go with that now and get these out of the way then we'll get back and read a little bit so then we go up from the third dimension we know that we go to the fourth dimension which you can see on the the drawing the fourth dimension is covered like the and it's perfectly put in there I really enjoyed the every who put these together and Aller what they done I just needed to rearrange it for my thoughts but see it's a good point put the tree of knowledge see the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil was a good point because that will cover the fourth dimension yep right because it is knowledge it is that and science has been able to break into those things that's right brother R said they broke into God's laboratory that's why they can do the things that that they're doing I never could understand how that brother Mo used to try to explain how that that they had a that you could take a it was cat was called now it went on into something else in the radio but you didn't even need a battery you didn't need anything it was a crystal and it was brought together and you had to line everything just perfectly up but you you didn't need a speaker you had a radio he said I don't believe that well see that's what the man told Brother mo one time he talking about them going in the outer space he he dips enough he don't believe that they a go out of space they just went out there in the desert somewhere well they did fly out in the Des but you know he just didn't believe it people ain't going to believe it and I'm not concerned about trying to get you to believe something my point is not to get you to believe how mechanically minded I am to be able to put all of this together because I told you if the devil hadn't made me sick I wouldn't have all the thoughts so you can blame the headaches and the and the temperatures for if you want to and say well that was his imagination well that's all right let's see if it fits the Bible if it don't then it's my imagination but we've got the fourth dimension which will be covering in the trip of knowledge The Fifth Dimension is a place for the unbelievers The Sinner dead y who died without Christ then you got under the altar which is the souls under the altar covering it with brother brandham you know and where he went to and that's the Christians who have passed on and then we have the place of called God alone all right and see we'll get back into it that there's an altar because that's where we are we're if you pass on you're under the altar right you know the different things were there but you can't go up into that seventh Dimension at this period of time that's right because it's still limited because we haven't reached immortality all right he can condescend to where we are and everything but we can't go into immortality because that's what he went into right amen all right we we've got the scriptures we're going through it now let's read what your Prophet had to say CU we were reading paragraph 21 a present stage of my Ministry now let's start with paragraph 22 23 24 now but we have contact through science the fourth dimension as it was because coming through this building now comes pictures voices of radio pictures on television that our senses does not contact that but yet they have a a tube or a crystal that picks up these ether ws and manif them so you see right in this building now is live actions of people in the a live voices they're here we know it they're absolutely the truth and the only thing you do they they catch it on I don't understand the mechanics of of those things that science has invented but we know that it proves to us there is a fourth dimension all right now we will get to it as we go along into the message brother brandham says cancer is a fourth-dimensional disease right amen all right and see then you will understand the things that has happened in life and we'll get down to it eventually to where that brother BR said like demons travel demons travel in that fourth dimension and in in backwards and forth all right now go on paragraph 23 Now The Fifth Dimension is where the sinner the unbeliever dies and goes to The Fifth Dimension is kind of well the horrible Dimension what do we get down to reading what those things are like a nightmare now this man and when a Christian dies he goes into the sixth Dimension and God is in the seventh Dimension now then you see the Christian when he dies he goes under the altar of God watch it right into the presence of God Under The Altar and he's at rest well brother daily we go right into the presence of God Amen but yet there's a dimension where God is at right that is not reached by mortality right all right now we made the other one to give you more of an idea okay this is the same thing but it's more of an idea now when you look at it you're going to think that brother Dale is goofed up what he's drawing and all cuz remember Joe and them done this and don't blame them they draw what I told them I wanted but see you got written on it this all of your things over here then you have heaven heaven is an atmosphere that's why it speaks of heavens of Heavens that's why it speaks that heaven and earth can pass away right right I mean the Bible's right because there are Heavens right there Heavenly atmospheres there spars that you grow up into right see and each one of them now you look how this dra out see first is life you know T like time light and matter next is the tree of knowledge which is the fourth dimension and then you put in there and you see all of these horrible things Fifth Dimension is the siner dead h look it's just in a space right okay these were brought in w war it's just in a space it's not a you know you don't hear Brother random talking about when he went down to Hell and did he seen green grce and times no that's right but when he went to the sixth Dimension if you look up in the sixth Dimension you'll see it begins to be green look at your drawing it begins to be green you can see it probably here here and look at the trees and the things cuz in the sixth Dimension when brother R went there he said people come running over the hills and right people were running he said over the heels and over the thing comeing right man they real amen that's right so that's what I'm trying to get you to see who wouldn't brother R didn't want to come back right that's right right amen he wanted to stay where he's at wow it was a whole lot more real and better yeah then look up to the seventh see and you'll see that it still covers trees and things and all up into where God would be in the seventh Dimension we have an altar there because we are under the the sixth Dimension you're under the altar of God all right and Jesus is laying on that altar right okay now we have some more draw drawings to bring later to pick up what we're talking about but see then everything just ties into that green and just greater and greater and greater until you get into what we'll get this afternoon the heaven of Heavens there's about six or eight scriptures that will cover the heavens of Heavens all right now so let's get on with something we went through the dimension he called them light life and matter all right let's go down to number four I think is where we'll pick up to right right let's study a little bit about these and I'm not going to spend much time in it I'm just going to cover a few things to make sure you understand the reality of what I'm trying to bring and then connect to it in a way to where you can see that these things are real CU in no way did I bring if if you've seen what's lay in my office you know the uh Paper Company loved me and the computers you know the ink and thing but uh you know I'm just handpicking certain things now one in he a minute I'll show you that I had to handpick for a long time because I didn't want to bring out what brother around said I'll cover it just a minute look what he says enticing Spirits paragraph 38 19 and 55724 he's talking about healings and applying the things and coming down and the gross and the cataracts and the spread of diseases and tubercular and things you know and demons that's in a physical form now this morning we're going to talk about talk about demons in spiritual form in the soul they're in the soul the same as they are in the body and we're bound to admit that we see them in PE people's body such as Cancers and and different diseases that's in the human body just recently even cancer has been declared to be a fourth-dimensional disease now watch it that it's in another dimension y sure it's demonology every disease is a fourth-dimension disease the beginning of it yet yep see because see your minds collect on cancer as a growth right unlock it cancer doesn't start as a growth right we know the prophet's message right even cancer is a backsliding cell right right it is not a growth it doesn't appear as a growth if it does if something was wrong you might have been born with it that way but it still still in its natural beginning it was not that right the and there's a lot of growth in the human body a lot of things they can take out and they they're wrong growth and and would be things that would be horrible and can kill us but they're not like cancer cancer is that cell that has backsliding in itself and the bases that it can can come forth and and uh you know and be a thing and it it's a life now how much do I need to cover that you should know that anybody internet listening to listen to brother R anytime at all you'll hear him talk about the life of the cancer he said now the life of the cancer is gone out he said but the growth is still there he said your body has to counteract that growth or either you have to go have it cut out see and and doing and and you know and that's why that he says you can do those things and be away and but if you let that come back yeah right he said you can be healed of a thing today and and die tomorrow of it why because you let the life come back see you you let it come back into taking its place the unclean Spirit goeth out a man walketh in dry places find his rest you know and don't find a rest sick of n he comes back and finds a house SW and garnish you know the scripture right all right so it's a a Domin disease he said all diseases every disease is a fourth dimensional disease y all right that's why that there's no way to do nothing other than treat your symptoms in your body right actually all mankind can do is try to Aid your immune system right and that's what AIDS is AIDS is not a growth development that does something to do that it simply attacks your immune system and you die from other things you don't die of AIDS you die from the effects of what it's drained the body of the immune system and brother R said God put it into us in the garden the an immune system into the human body and that Satan is attacking that cuz he knows if he can attack these bodies see that's why it's just good to be strong and and and do the best you can you know and exercise and and and and and everything you know eat right and do right I mean you got high blood pressure go eat you all the pork you don't to well you're just you're bringing it on yourself then you doctor no it ain't doctor it's you see I know better than E I got high blood pressure I know better better than the the eat a garbage can full of pork but I love it it's one of my most favorite Meats I guess is is pork but I don't eat a lot of it why because I know see we're not like we used to be in the old days when you when you had the large bucket full of grease and it was going out in the field and and you go out there and burn it out you know worked it off and swe it's not done it's just building it's just building up into it it's killing us but you understand what the prophet is talking about Dimensions see in that fourth dimension those diseases are there now I hunted until I found this quote before I would would bring it out because I know that it can hinder people's Faith now there has never been an operation that could take away cancer amen when you go down and they tell you you're cancer free that means it's you're down to the basis this is 80 something th000 count right I believe it's the right number now if I miss that just you put a number there whatever if it's two or four I believe it's 80,000 count and the machine will not record below that so when they tell you you're cancer free cuz nobody in the world is cancer free everybody has cancer now you want the Bible though my skin worms de destroy my body and in my flesh shall I see God all right it's because of the immune system that can fight off those things and keep it under control but it means that there's if they say you're cancer free that means you're 80 ,000 every what is the thing that they're using there to count that that's in your body up to that point but they can't record any lower so they count you cancer free and I didn't want to read the things brother rman said cuz it was a good meing but I found this one so let's look at it number five which is God provided a lamb 1956 614 he's talking about Abraham the coming down said oh my young brother sitting there in the wheelchair if you could only see that promise tonight sunny boy calvar is before you if you can just move the Shadows from your mind look there are something would anchor down in here there would be nothing in the world ever moving you'd be pushing that wheelchair out of the building and around the cable Tabernacle and the place where you come from and you that's dying with heart trouble worst killer there is cancer doctors can hardly do a thing about it I heard on the radio the other day that it couldn't be proved that one time an operation for cancer was ever successful they called it a fourth dimensional Dimension disease but God's got to cure now that's what I want you to read so I didn't want to read all them other see God's Got The Cure medicine is remedies God is cure I am the Lord that Health all of thy diseases all right see because how can you take out a demon a knife won't take a demon out of the body right it will take the growth that's right he said well if it's contained they say that your eyes the best place to have cancer because in the eyeball that they can literally take it out and it's contained within that and it you know it does but see you know what I'm talking about you got your limp nodes you got all these things that's why that they run all of their test and they do everything to try to check and see if it's anywhere else in the body but see I I thought I said I don't want people to think that I'm in unbelief I wanted your Prophet to say it but I didn't want to bring all of the quotes where he was saying that it's been proven that you cannot operate take out cancer right you can't take a disease out of the human body if it is a fourth-dimensional product disease God God has to drive it out right he's the only healer amen I don't care what you say that I went through this I went through that and it took care of that remember you're down to the 80,000 count you're down to the basis to where that all must happen is something to your immune system click and when it does it would start right back thank God for what we call immune system right amen I me thank God for healing he can take it away and totally cure the body but he's still going to there's still going to be those cells in there that's going to kill us there's still going to be those worms that's going to eat us up that's what you tell people you know and they just just cringe at you you know you say you ain't nothing but a bunch of worms that's right I saw a video one time of where they proven it you look under the layer of your skin with a high powered microscope and you look down and it ain't nothing but simply hollered out little things this G's already scratch and go it's just simple hollered out little holes under there microscopic small and there's a little worms just crawling all around sister gwy she wakes up in the night and go in worms again but they got to take care of right that's right that's why we got to depend on him all right I'm trying to put in a little bit with each one to where that'll be more interesting to just talk about a dimension that we can can cover all right now a fourth dimension is like the prophet was covering on number six of your notes where it's uh show us the father 1963 606 and he's telling you about the River of No Return where he said he caught a world record trout you know a lot of people didn't know that he caught a world record trout on that River and he was telling people to you know that where he's at and and everything the guide and the thing but he saw was it Merlin Monroe that was in a movie I believe it was Merlin Monroe in a movie and he saw her in the movie because he he wanted to see it because of the river he had been up and down that River and he saw her he said she was it never move see a fourth-dimensional thing a picture that was made and brought into a fourth dimensional scene right and he said in that Dimension he said we'll have to answer at the day of judgment are you reading I have to answer at the day of judgment do you say but I got by with it nobody didn't see me undress and nobody didn't see me make lud things yeah just remember in another dimension pictures are captured but nobody didn't take a picture of me it didn't it don't have to be because that's a fourth-dimensional place amen and brother Bram even said the color of your hire yep the color of your clothes and the things would be captured I've watched Joe with this thing my brother-in-law told me years ago because he was a photographer and this is talking about 40 years ago he said I said something about something had happened he said Sam I can take you put you in a motel with a woman and he said there ain't no way you can prove you wouldn't there he said I can overlay the camera and do things with it he said and put you in that room because it can be done you already to see Joe and I told him I said boy that'd be something if I had that computer I could do it he just take reach a corner like this and just peel off and just peel off you see like at you peel off overlays it was it Bruce Lee that they finished the movie with a stand in and then they made it uh animated form of it and tied it all together and they say you can't tell where that the original movie stopped and the guy got killed here in the movie being made and see the because they can do it you just think what science how advanced it can be and it's a fourth dimension right that's what I'm getting us at it's a fourth dimension that's right amen that they can do all of these things with trick photographies through everything and show you all of that doing overlays this trick photography and see every move we make go down to the next one go that's what he's covering so Paradox 1965 117 number seven on you not as I said in my last message you standing over there against that wall when I was here a few weeks ago every time you move your finger that goes around and around the world never will stop every move you make you'll see it at judgment television proves that it's here the fourth dimension cuz television doesn't manufacture that picture it only channels that wave into a tube and you see a picture color everything every moving object that's happening in the world is going right around through here now making a record someday your record is going to be closed and you're going to answer to that record that's right that's right so you kids think you're getting by with things right you think you sniffing a little dope you think you do a little drinking you think you do a little U maybe um unclosed a little bit in the wrong place or do this that just remember those are being seen sisters too you sneak around put a little bit of makeup on do a little bit of paint in your face up you know do a little thing just remember I brother They Don't Preach a lot about this right but every once in a while I lay down some things and when I do you better think that's right you said but nobody didn't see me right right you mean God can't see you that he knows before we ever even think about doing it amen that's right but see it's on record that's what I'm getting at Fourth Dimension is a whole lot more real than the Life Light and time or matter and time or whatever the fourth dimension is real why because there's pictures being taken of everything right you see or would there be any problems then to if you could some way tie those Dimensions together why couldn't you hear somebody in another dimension crying out dreams go into a fourth dimension nightmares and things fourth dimension and that's why they're so horrible cuz that's the way brother R described hell right he said hell was not a burning place he said it's a constant falling why because there's no bottom to it there's there's no scripture for an eternal hell see there's no bottom that's right no scripture for it so then it's just a constant falling that's going on down right see I gave you the next one on number eight of your notes I hope I can get through because I got a little bit I want to cover if I can but he calls them there the three dimensions and he calls it light air and thought now this is really after the other one where he was doing the time on but he called him you know light I'm giving that to just show you the case somebody comes along and said well I found this and works this way but see it's still what's the difference it's all the three dimensions whether you want to call it thought whether you want to call it that he covers it the same as being the radio W right right and he tells you where this the center goes to yep in that quote down there on the next about three three lines from the bottom then I think the Fifth Dimension is where the sinner dies where he goes now I think that when The Sinner dies he goes to this fourth dimension now listen I wonder if he made a mistake the first thing he cannot go into the presence of God because he is a sinner and his time is up on Earth I wonder did he make a mistake on that one because if you look in the way I draw it on this one or had Jo them to draw can you click this one back up rich it takes a second I know to do it but you notice I have archways I don't have straight lines cuz I didn't want straight lines you see the ARs ways right see that fourth dimension goes right up into the fifth it's only God can cut those things off right sure so you can go from one then a a maybe brother Brandon wasn't wrong when he was talking about The Fifth Dimension there and then he called it the fourth dimension right CU remember what we do in the fourth dimension is going into the fifth that we don't get it clear right right cuz that'd be where we go to maybe he doesn't make as many mistakes as we think he makes maybe he's more than what we think about it all right let's see getting off on my notes all right but you go right on down that's the countdown you just keep right on down if I were you I would there's two messages I would listen to one of them is called the countdown and the other one is present stage of my Ministry if I was wanting two tapes to read the books to to read or two tapes to listen to is to get the countdown and president stage of my Ministry and and watch him in what he's describing but he says if I would type it for you now remember he's still talking about this fourth dimensional things now it's like trying to go to sleep he talking about a fourth dimension you can't be asleep and you're in a nightmare you hideous things you're screaming you you're just all that's the state of the wicked dead and he cannot go into the presence of God because he is a sinner that's right he cannot return back to the Earth because his times up and he and he's caught between the two things in The Fifth Dimension he's got a soul he he cannot go into the presence of God because it's not covered by the blood he's a sinner and he cannot wake himself up because his times up on Earth so there he is in a tormented nightmare y think of that now because before you enter in a nightmare screen many of us have had nightmares it's just because we're told because the two consciences are passing sub and first conscience and it catches between and that's the Nightmare and when you a sinner dies he's caught between caught with his soul between Earth and Hell in a nightmare there he stands now I didn't bring these because I told you I didn't want to bring a lot of thing but what about the the man out there is it um who is this Mel chz where anyhow brother Brandon would tells about the man with the Overcoat on that they saw the car run into him and went up in the air and flipped over you've heard the story amen right he said he between the two worlds well you know what that was that was between this world and that world that's right sure cuz they a seen the car lunge it was told years ago up here in Gainesville that there would be a a woman with a wedding dress be coming down the street they're coming where you go through Gainesville and you go around and j& J's over here and there's the cemetery and they would pick her up in town and she'd ride down and then they would she would have them to stop and they'd get out at the cemetery yeah you can say well I don't believe in all of that I do real I do I don't go around looking for it and every puff of cloud that goes by ain't a spook right all right you see something in it flashes it's a flash you know I mean what is it out in the desert out there they call it fox fire you know did you see this thing boy it's just dancing all over the place and all that it's fox fire they call it it ain't nothing real but you see what I'm trying to get you to see these things are real okay are you following me that's my point that's right get you to see the realness of what's going on but he goes on in that same message now to describe number 10 on your notes now the sixth Dimension is in Christ the Saints dead Saints are resting Saints now notice I like what he said the sixth Dimension is in Christ yeah okay now you know how that we've been doing chosen in Christ and how we've been bringing it down dead Saints are resting Saints who is completely work finished on Earth and has entered into rest with Christ under the altar beautifully you could parallel it like a wonderful dream that you didn't want to wake up it ain't a dream it's natural it's real but I'm just making a parable to you and of course the seventh Dimension is God alone right now you'll see the next one if you want to read it while it's up there number 11 on your notes is actually a repeat of number three you'll see written on the side of your thing so you read these they repeat cuz I wanted you to read them so you read them I don't have the time to but it goes back to number three to where they we're going to but look at number 12 which is 62908 present stage of my Ministry paragraph 25 to break it down when a man has a nightmare he's not altogether asleep neither is he's awake he's between sleep and awake and that's what makes him have a horrible shaking and screaming because he's not asleep he's not awake and to take that shows me where a man goes when he dies unconverted he's lived his time up he's dead on Earth and he cannot go into the in the presence of God because he's not fit to go there without the blood amen and he goes on down if you notice in the last part of it is underlined he said I believe I was caught in that sixth Dimension right so we're going to have to cover that a little bit when we get to it he said he was caught into the sixth dimension huh that's the sold under the altar right okay try to get in a hurry drop off the next two cuz they're repeats go to 15 the fifth seal 63 322 and I said well I don't understand this and this is brother brandham when he said he was in this went to sixth Dimension that's when I watching that voice talking to me I never could see the voice that was just above me talking to me I said well if I have if I have passed on I want to see Jesus I said I want I I he was so he was all my life I want to see him so he said you can't see him now he's still higher and this is Brother Rand beyond the curtain of time right see it was below the altar yet see the sixth place where man goes see not the seventh where God is seventh Dimension he said the sixth okay he goes on down and gives you another beyond the curtain of time 1961 303 paragraph 49 he talks about how the multitude comeing you know the different things were happening they saw the lady there that was 90 years old and all crying and said I asked oh where is Jesus I want to see him the people replied now the other was the angel replying now I'd like to spend the rest of the day talking right there the people they were already near theophany right they were in their word form Souls under the altar they knew too see the people replied he's just a little higher someday he will come to you you will sent as a leader and when God comes he he'll judge you according to your teaching I asked does Paul and Peter have to stand the Judgment also they answered the answer was yes you remember he screamed out right I preached exactly all right now I hope you see what I'm trying to say to you of each Dimension being real and you know I had no intentions of telling you in the beginning but I felt led that I had to to tell you that the eighth there is not eighth Dimension right the seventh Dimension is where God is at this time and that would be the souls under the altar is right down under there and he's there and you know waiting a time he's not a dead body laying out on the throne you know there's not so no such thing he's got a lot of work he's doing right he's doing the Plan of Redemption right now if you'll study the church ages and the things brother random covers you'll get a a whole lot better understanding because if you'll go in there and read of those things of the throne read the message the throne there is a message titled at the throne read that one especially where he covers the Altar and a Brazen Altar and he said when he gets into the souls under the altar under the fifth seal he covers it on the seal book that he said now these were Souls under the altar he said they was under this altar he said but mine was not under that altar they was under this see showing the difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament are the F seal Jew and the bride of Christ but there is an altar in heaven and one laying on the throne right now for you and I amen right it's real yes he's making intercession there's a throne read Revelations 4 Revelations 5 we've been through there Revelations 5 what four you don't see one necessarily on the throne Revelations 5 you see one sitting on the throne but then you got to see according to uh it's coming to me uh but said he climbs up the throne souls in prison page 26 I'm pretty sure he said he climbs upon the throne and sits down he said he becomes the one on the throne all of that's got to take place right cuz you remember when we were starting that we we can't go into his presence because he's still in Redemption that's correct we can't go into immortality because that would be mortal and immortality won't connect you can't do it you got to wait till a change comes to step into that presence right so then sold under the altar crying how long but there is a seventh Dimension to where that we would call it Heaven wonderful oh the Heavenly place is wonderful but it is a dimension it's a place for God to abide in at this time and the things are taking place I said if you would read those things read Revelations 4 and5 and all and look at the things that are that John saw in heaven cuz that's where he was taken up to see to that place where up into the to the seventh dimensional form you say well could he go up that way by Vision that'll be very important in a couple of messages down the road when we cover that brother brandham said I went to the first Heaven he said but Paul went to the Third Heaven Keep It In Mind no man has approached immortality but a prophet can go there by as I said a moment ago just listening he when he said I've been in both places he said I've been in the place of the lost and I've been in the place of the Blessed by being a prophet he could go there not as an intruder or a person that would be burning in a Hell right see but being a prophet God could transmit him to there amen he could do those things amen but you see then the life would be would be the not a dimension the heavens of Heavens you'll see this afternoon is not a dimension there is no ending to it there is no beginning to heaven right and I see it as a beautiful place that's right trees don't need no highways don't need them things you said but Brother D I just can't see how real heaven is I just can't fathom a heaven above something that you're saying above the seventh Dimension well I'll give you a scripture if you we'll cover it this afternoon you know we say that before the flood that there was no water in the atmosphere right you know that's true right but it didn't say there was no water in heaven because the Bible said he would divide the waters that were under heaven and above heaven so there was water in heaven but scientific man can't go no further than the seven dimensions he was talking science can't go no further than a dimensional no situation so we can't see even though the Bible said there was water up there s says there was no water up there and let me quote brother brand a scientific world back there and probably interplanetary travel was back before the flood it would not have bothered me none whatsoever had they landed on the moon or if they landed on Mars today and find a cubicle City sitting up there that wouldn't bother me none whatsoever i' shot Glory cuz the Bible says as it was in the days of you nothing new Ecclesiastes says under the sun right the things that have things that are have been so they had interplanetary travel that's right okay that's why I don't understand people you know that you never see U I'm saying something for a second then I'll get on the point you never see uh when they try to prove that there was some kind of a something going on is always drawings in the cave there's always been people that didn't know what was going on but if you'd never seen an aircraft and you was out in the middle of some jungle or something here comes an aircraft down and it lands and a guy gets out with a flamethrower and starts shooting it all around and all these things are happen you'd buy down and call him God wouldn't you then you go make a picture of him see they were scientific Before the Flood interplanetary travel would have truly been back there but now I want to say this a word to you and then you got the quotes to read it from brother around talking about eternal life I was in my father and my grandfather great-grandfather we don't have to put these up until we click over to the light for Richard but everybody can read it when I in my father in thanks go over to number 20 Richard guess heant no he had clicked there yet go to number 20 cuz this is what I tried to explain Wednesday tried to explain something to you Wednesday so I believe eternal life is real right now you can believe what you want to but you're Prophet when it said it in token 1964 to 8 paragraph 192 if God would have spoke to me back before the foundation of the world when I was a thought in his mind so were you if he just said what age would you want to live in I'd have said this right now it's the most glorious time there is he explains the next one that the only way you'll ever know anything is to understand the Spears of the spirituality of the inward man look at the last one number 23 Satan's Eden 1965 829 so God knew that we would be here but then he put us in flesh so we would be contacted in order to be contacted he became one of us when he became Jesus Christ as Son of God himself the fullness of the manifestation of God therefore that was God's purpose to display his attributes in Fellowship when I was in my father I knew nothing about it but when I became his son and was born to him I was an attribute a part of my father and you're a part of your father and as children of God we are children we are a part of God's attribute that was in him made flesh like he was made flesh so we can have Fellowship one with the other as a family of God upon the Earth and that was God's purpose at the beginning yes sir that's what God wanted at the beginning he had everything under control he turned man over to it in the Garden of Eden on freem moral agency said son is yours I was looking you can go through the next one back behind it on Satan's Eden or brother man Zach he says they actually uh you know know nothing about it but he said your father long for you to come right now he's talking about natural now he's only typing that's what I was trying to get across Wednesday right you see putting it in because I'm talking about heaven not a dimension to blank it off not a dimmension hey Heaven all right and up in heaven see there's no way brother collie that you could want to fellowship with your natural children that's only a story true amen come on all we want to do was what is it procreate all right we had no thoughts as I was trying to illustrate Wednesday with brother dick and sister Gail that if you had three and knew that was going to be then you could long on those three but we can't humanly do that right we only come by procreation we only come from desires you want to call that desires well I had desires from to be a daddy well that's all right but you didn't know about being a father you didn't know where's going to be a you didn't know where it was going to be a boy or a girl or what it was going to be right but it's not so with God that's right not so God knew exactly how many children he was going to have and what they were going to be y amen why can't we look back and see that he asked us where would you like to be why can't you see that God looking down through time remember this started on the day of Pentecost now we're not talking about the Old Testament we're not talking about all those other we're talking about the kingdom of God righten and he looks down and he sees oh Paul he says Paul where would you like to be well you know my ways yep and you'll fit down on the body you you said no no no you're making eternal life too much of a reality oh what would you like to be well if you don't want to I'll just place you in place so Paul your nature and your ways will fit right here you said now you're making eternal life in nature and ways why can't I make it his nature in his ways I thought we believed an attribute was of nature I thought we proved the point he said Luther I need a man to stand out and protest the world he said I'll take that place CU remember the seed comes predestinated eternally not the human body right so he said all right your name on Earth will be Luther but it's not that we'll cover that he said will you when we get through with the journey but your name will be Martin Luther you will protest who done the protested Christ who was that Christ who was that in Paul Christ Iranians Martin Columbo Luther wesle Elijah I thought we dwelt in the last days that Elijah would have the the nature and ways of the great Elijah that was back there but see that was part to do with William brandham on Earth but can't you just see he says I'll send you to Earth Earth there's going to be a fall C remember the prior message to this the morning star sang together sons of God shouted for Joy why when they seen the Plan of Redemption come into view you mean that that we just see it as a shouting down here where's your matching pieces that's 20 years what 10 years ago matching pieces see when Martin Luther match what was in heaven they wouldn't but one thing that man could do protest that Catholic church and do what he's supposed to do cuz that was the Christ each one of those Believers down through time now where are you at that's right why are you the last brother ROM said I want to be here because of the great glorious things that's taking place but why do you want to be here I want to be here to glorify my father amen am that's right I want my father to get Glory that's the glory the honor and all CU it ain't been a man it's been Christ so I didn't finish up what I'm talking about I just walked down and tried to illustrate a little bit with you cuz you remember now may I say it again my children was in me right yes but I couldn't fellowship with them yes and I didn't know they were in there as two boys boys and a girl right my wife Mis cared 2 three times what are you going to deal with I didn't know that and I didn't have no desire for them to it wasn't a desire in my body to fellowship with my children at that time was it in you no you were just getting mad having a good time and enjoyed everything letting the harmones run but say it's not so with God right he knew exactly every age he know exactly what you and I would look like he knew exactly our nature and our ways he knows exactly how to deal with us right he knows exactly how to deal with us our natur and our ways but you know sometimes they got to change that's right you know there was a day when a man sitting right back there I know him a couple of weeks he was tough as Sho I walked up to him and I rubed him oh he I twist him around do it I said you need a cup of coffee and it's going to be extra sugar this man sitting right here told me he said you better leave him alone he said he's mean he said he'll hurt you but you see I wouldn't have done this to brother dick that day but I can now see changes things takes place that's right you don't fool me on nature and ways I look down at every one of you and find a nature that I like thank you Lord find a lot of things I don't like but I find something I like right and I deal with you according to that nature that's right never been wrong yet CU I look down inside of you I don't look at your outside if I looked the outside I'd killed every one of us by the word right but I don't do it let's stand together I'm sorry a little bit late I want to get that last part just a little bit I believe in God being real I believe that he had a desires and those desires inside of him was me inside of him was a desire to come forth to be and that was me right and we're not the same and we're not the same in eternity we're a body of Christ you remember the other week I tried to express those we're a body of Christ then let me act like the that I am well you're thinking of eternal life it's just everybody being the same no right God knew what it would take to be in this hour yep that's and he put you here to face this situation in this hour why can't we realize that right Paul can't come and take your place am I quoting brother Brown can't do it no no way for it to be done what we got brother 204 204 anybody have a need there is com day when no shall come for in the No More Tears to me high all forever I'm you believe those me real more real than this oh I want
