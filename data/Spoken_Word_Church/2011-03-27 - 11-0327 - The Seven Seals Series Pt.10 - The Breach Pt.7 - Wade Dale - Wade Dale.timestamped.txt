[0:00] huh
[0:09] let's turn to the Book of Job chapter 19
[0:11] and we're going to read something here
[0:14] we quoted a lot
[0:17] but we're going to read
[0:22] statement that job made
[0:25] about
[0:27] his flesh
[0:29] um
[0:31] like you're left-handed you always put
[0:34] that on your left side I have to why
[0:36] don't left either
[0:43] way
[0:48] I think that kind of people we have in
[0:50] this room
[0:55] listen for all of you on the internet
[0:57] you all have a right to be wrong
[1:01] right amen
[1:05] use the right side of our brain
[1:08] yeah
[1:19] the other left
[1:22] all right chapter 19.
[1:26] because in Revelations chapter five
[1:32] as we've said before we're going to read
[1:33] today
[1:34] this has to do with your flesh
[1:39] now job we know was not a born-again
[1:41] Christian but he can be a type of a
[1:43] born-again believer
[1:45] he was not a
[1:48] um when job was here standing in the Old
[1:50] Testament he was not
[1:53] fried but he can be as John and be as
[1:56] others type the bride
[2:00] in verse 23.
[2:05] oh that my words were now written or
[2:07] that they were printed in a book
[2:10] that they were Graven with an iron pin
[2:12] and lead in the rock forever
[2:16] where I know
[2:18] that my redeemer liveth
[2:21] personal
[2:24] and thank my wife for this talk this
[2:27] morning because she sparked a little
[2:29] something I want to get started with but
[2:31] we were talking about this coming up the
[2:33] road I know that my redeemer limits now
[2:36] I don't know that your redeemer lives
[2:38] right see how personal this is right
[2:41] this was personal to Joe all right so
[2:44] this Revelations 5 has got to be
[2:46] personal to you let's just be honest
[2:48] with ourselves we can set in a
[2:49] Congregation of 100 people today and the
[2:52] guy sitting beside of you or the gal
[2:54] sitting beside of you
[2:57] that's right
[2:59] and you'd never know it because this is
[3:01] the end time
[3:03] okay don't look over each other and make
[3:05] judgment okay because buy you fruits
[3:07] you'll be known and somewhere you're
[3:08] gonna I sit there by myself so I'm fine
[3:14] I just have to judge me that's right
[3:16] okay this is what job's saying but look
[3:21] for I know that my redeemer liveth and
[3:23] that he shall stand
[3:25] at the latter day upon the earth now not
[3:28] job
[3:29] the Redeemer
[3:31] okay Joe's dead
[3:34] okay
[3:35] at the latter day upon the Earth
[3:38] so what's he standing in Brian form
[3:42] all right
[3:43] so let's click our brain over to that
[3:45] Brian foreign and though after my skin
[3:48] worms destroyed this body
[3:50] people that have gone on and died
[3:52] yet in my flesh shall I see God
[3:56] there's your resurrection and change
[3:58] that job is looking for knowing that he
[4:01] could see the grass
[4:03] uh die and see the flowers die but look
[4:06] out here now the same place we saw snow
[4:08] two months ago there's a green stem
[4:11] going up with a big pretty flower on top
[4:14] of it where'd it come from
[4:15] okay from the Earth but it died and come
[4:18] back to life see every day it shows a
[4:20] resurrection every year shows the
[4:22] resurrection in the Earth
[4:23] potentially but job then said now I see
[4:27] man die and I see him no more
[4:30] he had a question is Mom where's he at
[4:32] brother right where's he going I haven't
[4:33] seen anything but when he said right
[4:35] here oh that my words were now written
[4:37] though they were printed in a book
[4:39] and though after my skin worms destroyed
[4:42] this body yet in my flesh shall I see
[4:45] God
[4:47] yeah we got to have that same testimony
[4:50] and we don't you know that those that
[4:53] are already going on the skin worms has
[4:54] already destroyed their body
[4:57] but that didn't bother Joe he said yeah
[5:00] in my flesh
[5:03] and I'll see him for myself now look
[5:05] whom I shall see for myself not we they
[5:09] are us right
[5:12] when I shall see for my whom I shall see
[5:15] for myself and mine eyes Shall Behold
[5:19] and not another
[5:23] all right
[5:24] that to me is the opening of the seal
[5:29] just in a nutshell
[5:32] why
[5:35] the seventh seal is not going to be open
[5:36] to everybody it's going to be an
[5:38] individual affair with God if you have a
[5:41] body change right sure okay
[5:44] it's not because your wife's sister
[5:46] brother daddy mama papa believe this
[5:48] message
[5:50] you gotta have an experience with God
[5:52] you got to have a positive experience
[5:55] with God just like Joe was showing right
[5:56] here when I shall see for myself and
[5:59] mine eyes see this is where mine eyes
[6:02] where's the eyes eyes of understanding
[6:05] see the Bible says my eyes of
[6:07] understanding be open right
[6:09] right all right
[6:10] and not another
[6:13] it's not going to be a collector we're
[6:15] not going as a as a denomination
[6:17] Collective group that's right sure we
[6:19] are in this group of the Bride but it's
[6:21] made up of many members right
[6:23] individuals that's right make up this
[6:26] body
[6:28] though my Reigns be consumed Within Me
[6:31] In other words though this guy right
[6:33] here
[6:35] is going to be sticky to the change this
[6:39] guy right here was uh is still a
[6:41] huckleberry until the chains come
[6:43] but the inside Guy the one he's talking
[6:45] about right here though that my skin
[6:47] worms destroyed this body we know we're
[6:49] not getting another one he said yet in
[6:51] my flesh so what was he standing in he
[6:53] said though the skin worms destroyed my
[6:54] flesh in my flesh I'm gonna see God he
[6:56] had a revelation
[6:58] that he was going to take a change not a
[7:00] replacement right right okay so to me
[7:03] this is very important in this scripture
[7:05] right here people you know they they
[7:06] called it all the time but to me this
[7:08] shows Revelations 5 and 6. and eight
[7:12] the opening of the seals right here this
[7:14] is an individual affair with God you've
[7:17] got to believe that your flesh can be
[7:19] changed before it can be changed that's
[7:20] right now job had a partial
[7:23] understanding because job died but see
[7:26] it says here at the latter day
[7:30] will stand upon the earth now look
[7:33] catch this for I know that my redeemer
[7:36] liveth
[7:37] or are we talking about a kinsman
[7:39] redeemer in Revelations 5. he takes the
[7:42] book
[7:43] comes out of the church ages takes a
[7:45] book sets down on the throne all right
[7:47] becomes one on the throne we'll read
[7:49] that in a little while if we have time
[7:50] I'm taking up too much time now but this
[7:52] is very important
[7:54] for I know that my redeemer liveth and
[7:56] that he shall stand at the latter day
[7:59] upon the Earth Jesus Christ the Redeemer
[8:01] himself his body will not stand on this
[8:04] Earth until after we change so what is
[8:07] this talking about
[8:09] that's right this is to me this is bride
[8:13] form
[8:14] he's in brine form right here because
[8:16] the only way Jesus Christ is going to
[8:18] ever stand on the earth at the latter
[8:19] day
[8:21] is in a group of people right and
[8:23] they've got to get a revelation that
[8:25] that's God in human flesh standing on
[8:27] the earth so Joe said it
[8:31] um
[8:32] thousand three thousand four thousand
[8:36] four thousand years ago
[8:39] more than that
[8:41] because this is 1500 BC going back the
[8:44] other direction you gotta go 1500 to get
[8:45] to zero and then go two thousand years
[8:47] for 3 500 years
[8:49] 3 500 years ago God came down and
[8:51] revealed to job in partial understanding
[8:53] not perfect
[8:55] he got partial understanding because he
[8:56] didn't take a chance but job said I know
[8:59] that my redeemer liveth and though the
[9:01] skin worms destroy this body he knew
[9:02] there was sin because what did he do he
[9:04] saw what happened when Satan
[9:07] got a hold of his kids and got a hold of
[9:09] his farm and that all went away and see
[9:12] job spent a lot of his time worrying
[9:14] that his children had what committed a
[9:17] sin right so he made sacrifices for him
[9:20] okay then they got to accusing job of
[9:24] doing something wrong
[9:27] well Joe knew there was something wrong
[9:28] it was his flesh that's why he said
[9:31] right here when he got that when that
[9:32] thing clicked and he said hey I know I
[9:34] can't do anything about it
[9:37] but this man this redeemer is going to
[9:39] take this body
[9:41] he's going to come in a body of Flesh
[9:43] die give his life change his body come
[9:47] back in a group of people and that's
[9:49] when death is going to be destroyed all
[9:51] right so in my flesh
[9:54] let's keep that in mind from now until
[9:57] we finish this thing up ever how many
[9:59] months or years it takes
[10:03] that's going to be my thing in My Flesh
[10:06] I shall figure
[10:09] in my flesh
[10:13] because he remember brother Brown he
[10:15] makes these little statements and
[10:16] everybody's like well that's just
[10:18] statements he makes he's a good
[10:19] Storyteller that's true but it was God
[10:20] telling us a story right he said this is
[10:23] my eye
[10:25] he said once it was God he said but God
[10:28] gave me this I announce mine and God's
[10:30] not going to take it back
[10:32] there's not an Indian giver he gives you
[10:35] the new birth and now whose New Birth is
[10:36] sure we know it's his we don't deny but
[10:38] who's is it in my flesh
[10:42] so let's remember that in Revelation 5
[10:45] because
[10:46] all the things I've been telling you
[10:48] John was a born-again Christian for 60
[10:51] years before he made it to Patmos
[10:56] excuse me and he's here crying because
[10:58] he needed a redeemer
[11:02] he was redeemed 60 years ago
[11:06] okay
[11:08] let's get one thing out of our head when
[11:10] we start reading this because a lot of
[11:11] people here in the in the breach
[11:14] they see that you know brother Brown
[11:16] says well the lamb comes from around the
[11:18] around the throne come out of the church
[11:20] ages
[11:21] takes the book sits down the throne
[11:23] redemption's over because remember it
[11:25] gets Smokey and all those things
[11:27] excuse me that means judgment
[11:30] so everybody is into the point of some
[11:33] of them say well redemption's over
[11:36] nobody else can be saved
[11:38] all our brother Brown's got to come back
[11:40] and tell you this your redemption's over
[11:42] let's just pull them both together
[11:45] yup Redemption is over
[11:48] and through brother Reynolds message
[11:50] Redemption though
[11:52] we're not a return minister
[11:54] okay so maybe looking at me kind of
[11:56] strange
[11:57] because when you become born again
[12:00] God can give you no more eternal life
[12:03] than he gave you the day you got it
[12:05] that's right that's right
[12:06] so your Redemption is over right for
[12:09] yourself that's right
[12:12] John's Redemption was over 60 years ago
[12:16] for his soul and potentially for his
[12:18] body because guess what though he's dead
[12:21] though my skin worms destroy my body in
[12:24] my flesh
[12:25] John's going to raise right up from what
[12:28] took him from what gave him the new
[12:29] birth that's what's going to Quicken
[12:31] Romans 8 Romans 8 says what let's read
[12:34] it
[12:35] Romans 8.
[12:40] no I didn't drink him
[12:49] eight
[12:54] where's eleven but the spirit of him
[12:56] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[12:59] in you
[13:03] I believe Paul
[13:06] was reading job sometime before he wrote
[13:08] this because it's the same thing it's
[13:11] the same identical thing John remember
[13:13] Paul got Mo you said well it was the
[13:16] Holy Ghost people but John had Paul you
[13:20] got now confused call him
[13:24] Paul had to read the Old Testament to
[13:28] get the New Testament he didn't take
[13:31] something out of the air remember you
[13:33] can't add a word to God's word and you
[13:35] can't take a word away
[13:36] so Paul took the Old Testament and
[13:38] expounded on it
[13:40] I believe he read job where it says in
[13:43] my flesh I shall see God I know my
[13:46] redeemer liveth now let's listen to what
[13:48] Paul said in the New Testament version
[13:51] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[13:54] Jesus from the dead dwell in you
[13:58] right he that raised up Christ from the
[14:01] dead shall also Quicken your soul
[14:04] I'm going to say that it says your
[14:07] mortal
[14:08] body
[14:10] mortal you're not Immortal yet
[14:14] but it's going to Quicken your mortal
[14:16] body
[14:17] by his spirit
[14:19] that do other than you
[14:22] Quicken your mortal body job said in my
[14:25] flesh now how can a dead man raise up
[14:28] and say in my flesh I shall see God
[14:30] something had to Quicken that body
[14:32] all right so in the book in This Book of
[14:34] Revelations chapter 5 God is showing you
[14:38] that somewhere he's going to make the
[14:40] ones that are dead
[14:42] because remember the Bible says he
[14:44] searched in heaven searched in Earth and
[14:46] under the Earth
[14:48] they look everywhere
[14:50] Revelations 5.
[14:56] the Bible just ties together more and
[14:58] more every day
[15:01] then verse 3 and no man in heaven
[15:05] Saints is going on nor in the Earth
[15:08] right now neither under the Earth dead
[15:14] was able to open the book neither to
[15:15] look their own but there was one that
[15:17] had been
[15:19] I just caught this
[15:21] there's only been one person that
[15:23] fulfilled verse three
[15:26] Jesus Christ had been in heaven I come
[15:29] from God I go to God right he was in the
[15:32] Earth
[15:33] that's right he got buried under the
[15:35] Earth
[15:37] and he's the only one that's able
[15:38] because what he do he came out of that
[15:40] grave Immortal now there's been a lot of
[15:42] people raised from the dead Lazarus was
[15:45] raised from the dead but he died more
[15:46] than he raised mortal right right Jesus
[15:49] Christ died mortal raised immortal
[15:53] life and immortality has been brought to
[15:56] life through the gospel right the only
[15:58] one the Old King quote the only one that
[16:01] has reached immortality which means one
[16:03] day he was Mortal the next day then more
[16:05] Immortal not Immortal Immortal okay
[16:08] everybody understand that you didn't
[16:10] have to die again he didn't have to die
[16:11] again
[16:12] he had eternal life but what changed his
[16:15] body
[16:17] what he had inside of it
[16:20] what he had inside of him he believed
[16:22] remember brother Ryan said he believed
[16:23] in one scripture I will not leave my
[16:25] soul in hell
[16:27] neither will I let my Holy One see
[16:29] corruption
[16:30] corruption says that 72 hours right
[16:33] so
[16:35] his body didn't see corruption he knew
[16:37] he would raise before that body began to
[16:39] rot
[16:41] he raised on one scripture how about me
[16:43] and you
[16:44] how about me and you believe in
[16:46] Revelations 8 11. if that spirit that
[16:50] dwells in you dwells in Jesus Christ it
[16:52] quit it raised him from the dead it'll
[16:54] Quicken your Immortal body
[16:56] so potentially if you're born again
[16:58] today potentially it doesn't matter what
[16:59] age you were in potentially
[17:02] you're already raised sitting in
[17:04] Heavenly places your Redemption is over
[17:07] but remember a pardon is not a pardon
[17:09] unless it's accepted
[17:11] you accepted the pardon that Jesus
[17:13] Christ saved your soul that's good but
[17:16] only in the end time could God ever come
[17:18] down and break open the seal and showed
[17:21] you that this body can be redeemed
[17:24] and is already redeemed you're already
[17:28] if you're in the process if you're a
[17:30] Christian and you're in a process your
[17:32] body is becoming subject to your soul
[17:36] look at what you don't do anymore
[17:38] like I said before this hand that used
[17:41] to that used to to carry a beer can
[17:43] around it's the same hand
[17:46] but God changed the desire inside of me
[17:48] so the desire inside of me says this
[17:50] hand's not going to do that anymore
[17:51] that's right the desire that I had to
[17:54] say those words that I said well I got
[17:56] the same mouth
[17:58] gets me in trouble still but but not
[18:01] like it used to
[18:03] okay it don't say the words there's
[18:06] something inside it's working its way
[18:08] out okay by your fruits you'll know the
[18:11] people
[18:15] all right so revelation's five let's
[18:17] let's read a little bit
[18:20] we got about 20 minutes let's start
[18:24] where we left off on page 76
[18:28] I'm all right though
[18:31] this is our theme from now on
[18:40] a big old eye foreign
[18:55] and if you die and go by the grave so
[18:57] what
[18:58] that still applies because in your flesh
[19:01] you're going to see God if you're born
[19:02] again today absolutely
[19:06] your throne room is Smoky
[19:09] it is Judgment because who is the
[19:11] Judgment upon yourself
[19:12] so redemption's over for you
[19:15] everybody understand that yes but
[19:18] there's still a process we've accepted
[19:20] the pardon for our soul but we've not
[19:22] accepted the pardon for this outside God
[19:24] that's right because we got to believe
[19:27] that it was signed sealed and delivered
[19:30] by President Abraham Lincoln according
[19:32] to what you know brother Brown gave the
[19:34] story if that man see listen it's that
[19:36] man had accepted that pardon from
[19:39] Abraham Lincoln his body
[19:42] his spirit and his soul
[19:46] would have been redeemed right
[19:48] natural
[19:50] because he wouldn't have been killed
[19:53] see you know you said well that that's
[19:56] good because not important you know for
[19:58] your soul but think about it that man
[19:59] died in his flesh because he did not
[20:01] believe the pardon
[20:03] but if he would have believed a pardon
[20:05] he would have been redeemed
[20:08] because remember when you pardon
[20:10] somebody
[20:12] you restore them back to here you can't
[20:14] take that against him anymore a
[20:16] presidential pardon wants it sealed on a
[20:19] book their record is exonerated to go
[20:22] back to when they were born
[20:25] now how much more if a man can do that
[20:27] on the Earth a human mortal Man by the
[20:30] laws of the land he can do that what a
[20:33] mighty God can do that
[20:35] that's our problem people we just can't
[20:37] believe that God can do that now that's
[20:39] just the bare bone fact myself all the
[20:42] way back
[20:43] we can't believe this guy right here
[20:46] is God made manifest
[20:48] and he's already quick in this thing
[20:49] because we get older we do things wrong
[20:53] if we're pardon can we accept the pardon
[20:58] everything has been taken care of
[21:01] but we still got to go through the
[21:03] Journey of life
[21:04] they all got and listen if you come down
[21:07] to the end of the road and you and you
[21:09] you say well I don't think I got it well
[21:12] you fruits will show somewhere down the
[21:14] line
[21:14] see because job was definite he said at
[21:17] the last day this is all going to come
[21:19] together and happen
[21:21] in Revelation 5 that's what's happening
[21:22] everything's coming together
[21:25] the lamb is going to take the book God's
[21:28] going to sit on his throne or Jesus
[21:29] Christ is going to sit on his throne
[21:31] excuse me remember in Revelation 3 14 he
[21:34] keeps telling what the promises are our
[21:36] promise is that we get to sit with Jesus
[21:38] Christ who is immortal
[21:41] he's sitting on the throne in human
[21:42] flesh right now
[21:44] human flesh right
[21:46] that bodies guys not some
[21:47] extraterrestrial body and all that come
[21:49] out of this Earth it was the same body
[21:50] you went down in same body you ate and
[21:52] then preached in done all those things
[21:54] that same body resurrected in his
[21:56] standing right now interceding for us
[21:59] it's sitting on the throne he's sitting
[22:00] on a throne somewhere
[22:02] sure we know he's sitting on the throne
[22:03] of our heart but he literally is
[22:04] somewhere right the person of Jesus
[22:07] Christ if you can touch
[22:10] right
[22:11] brother Brown said he is a being
[22:13] he has a place to dwell he has a throne
[22:16] to sit on because Jesus would never said
[22:19] right here
[22:21] to him and overcome will I grant to sit
[22:23] with me in my Throne who's talking about
[22:25] Jesus Christ remember seeing red letters
[22:27] so Jesus is speaking that tonight
[22:29] 3 21. even as I also overcame and I'm
[22:32] sat down with my father in history so
[22:35] down through the church ages he was
[22:37] sitting on the father's Throne which is
[22:38] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Son of
[22:40] God Revelation that your soul can be
[22:42] redeemed
[22:43] but they've always been a separation
[22:45] between your soul and your body down to
[22:47] the church ages well this guy this is my
[22:49] soul this can be redeemed it's okay but
[22:51] this guy can't do anything there's
[22:53] nothing you do about this it's got to
[22:54] die
[22:55] then when this guy goes down with it and
[22:57] he goes to heaven
[22:59] this guy somehow is going to appear with
[23:01] a new body
[23:02] a flesh and there's nothing going to
[23:04] happen to this guy
[23:06] he has to lie the devil right
[23:08] because that's his job
[23:11] divide and conquer all right
[23:15] but see he tells you said hey you were
[23:17] born from your mama and you did all
[23:19] these things in your past life and you
[23:21] can't be this and you can't be that
[23:23] that's right
[23:24] sure there's things that you know that
[23:26] that if I go and commit adultery today I
[23:28] know I can't preach or I can't be a
[23:30] deacon you know that's things that we
[23:31] can't do as far but that doesn't mean
[23:33] that I can't have this this guy I can't
[23:35] walk around for eternity in this man
[23:36] that's right
[23:38] but it was mine it was my mind
[23:41] it was what I let myself do as a person
[23:44] okay I overrode
[23:47] because see God remember brother Brown
[23:49] said it's very interesting but we'll
[23:51] redo next week let's just talk about
[23:53] this for a minute
[23:55] brother Brown said the Holy Ghost is
[23:56] timid
[23:58] he'll go out on the limb you start doing
[24:00] stuff with things wrong he'll go out on
[24:02] a limb and then you have to ask him to
[24:03] come back well that doesn't mean that he
[24:05] takes eternal life out of your soul that
[24:07] just means that you have overcome you
[24:08] have you have
[24:10] took that timid Holy Spirit and you've
[24:12] pushed it down all right because it says
[24:14] grieve what's grieve do
[24:17] suppress if you're in grief what are you
[24:19] doing you're down you're you're you're
[24:21] you're way down and you think things are
[24:23] wrong you know all you just is greed not
[24:25] the holy spirit of God so brother Ron
[24:26] said it says they said greed not that
[24:28] means you can grieve it
[24:29] all right and that will mean that you'll
[24:31] have to die natural death
[24:35] I want us to be real about this you'll
[24:37] have to die natural death because of
[24:39] what you think of what the word says
[24:40] right right what you can accept
[24:44] all right I've made examples many times
[24:46] before but you got to look at it on the
[24:48] positive side
[24:50] your mother Sister Hazel
[24:53] um
[24:55] Margaret the ones that have gone on
[24:57] before God saw that that was the
[24:59] Pinnacle of their understanding
[25:02] which is a great thing right
[25:04] hey
[25:05] we think it's bad
[25:08] they don't hate their job anymore that's
[25:11] right they don't pay taxes anymore
[25:14] they're in a glorified condition not
[25:17] what not a you know body of flesh but
[25:19] they're in their theophany
[25:21] Eternal as they ever will be
[25:24] but they're not in their total right to
[25:26] be conditioned right because we got to
[25:28] get back in this guy because job said
[25:30] job didn't say in my extraterrestrial
[25:32] body
[25:33] Joe didn't say in my soul he said in my
[25:36] flesh
[25:38] My Flesh personal guy right I shall see
[25:43] God Sister Hazel came to a point where
[25:45] that's all the gods she could see and
[25:46] and God said okay I'm finished
[25:50] everybody
[25:51] brother random anybody that's gone on
[25:54] God has been if you're a Christian God's
[25:56] finished with him he saw before the
[25:58] foundation of the world they would come
[26:00] to a certain point and that's as far as
[26:02] they go remember the man that asked for
[26:04] 15 years we think man that's a great
[26:06] thing he should have went on right then
[26:09] got that next 15 years he got worse
[26:14] but God knew he would but see he asked
[26:16] for it and God gave it to him right okay
[26:19] so exactly Solomon he messed up in his
[26:23] into his you know life
[26:26] maybe it's not good I mean some of you
[26:28] get rocking towards 70 years old
[26:32] at 50 sometimes I feel a little rough
[26:34] yeah so you know
[26:38] it's not a bad thing if we pass on
[26:41] but there is going to be a group of
[26:44] people that's going to stand on the
[26:45] earth and it ain't going to be all kids
[26:49] I thought a long time ago
[26:51] that
[26:53] I mean back when I was 14 you know I
[26:55] knew about the body change and I knew
[26:57] you know we were going to church here
[26:58] and I knew I was listening I was reading
[26:59] I knew the problem was talking about
[27:00] getting a body change and then we were
[27:02] going to be maybe uh physically bereft
[27:05] and we were going to maybe be at the
[27:07] mercy of the elements so I thought man
[27:09] it's going to take some superhuman
[27:11] you know big Arnold Schwarzenegger
[27:13] looking thing to to make it and and then
[27:16] the thought came back to me well Samson
[27:18] was not an Arnold Schwarzenegger looking
[27:21] kid right he was a little ready
[27:24] little boy with seven little curls
[27:26] running down his head now we put them
[27:28] over in the funny farm now
[27:30] but God said that's my man
[27:33] why did the Philistines Chase spend
[27:36] their whole entire time trying to find
[27:38] out where he got his strength from if he
[27:40] was 6'8 and this big
[27:42] you know how to test this big and arms
[27:44] this big
[27:45] when he picked up a gate you just say
[27:47] man this guy's strong but when you got a
[27:49] little guy looking like Don Knotts or
[27:51] Barney Fife and he'd walk around like
[27:52] this with a seven long girl and he gets
[27:55] mad and he picks up a City Gate that
[27:57] weighs two and a half tons each
[28:00] that's five tons and he picks the things
[28:03] up and he walks up and sets them down on
[28:04] the hill they wanted to know where he
[28:06] got his strength from
[28:08] that was amazing to them why do you
[28:10] think they kept trying
[28:12] like I said if this guy walks out and
[28:14] he's you know looks like Mr Universe
[28:15] they think well he's just being strong
[28:17] but when a little ready guy goes out
[28:19] there look at David
[28:22] the Bible said he was pretty he was a
[28:24] nice looking guy but he's ready a little
[28:26] bit small stooped over kind of guy
[28:28] well maybe that's one is going to take
[28:30] the change of the body you know the guy
[28:33] that just continually walks with gun
[28:36] don't have to be you know the
[28:38] uh you don't have to look like the
[28:40] athlete that I thought everybody would
[28:42] have to look like and everybody have to
[28:44] be young to take a body change if you're
[28:45] young you don't need a body change
[28:47] foreign
[29:15] whatever it didn't matter job said I
[29:18] know
[29:19] that my redeemer lives and in my flesh I
[29:22] shall see God and I'll see him for
[29:25] myself in other words I'll have a
[29:27] revelation of who he is doesn't matter
[29:29] if anybody else does
[29:31] and that's what we've got to look at in
[29:33] it in that job 19 in my flesh I shall
[29:36] see God and not I might
[29:39] if you're born again so if anybody's
[29:41] asked you if anybody says what do you
[29:43] believe about Redemption I'll I'll tell
[29:45] them I'll say look my Redemption is over
[29:49] I can't speak for you
[29:51] I can't speak for all the bride
[29:53] but my Redemption is over I can't be no
[29:56] more redeemed than I am now I've just
[29:57] got to work this guy in a process right
[29:59] to get to it
[30:02] because this man right here if you've
[30:03] got the Holy Ghost today in your soul
[30:05] this man right here will see God in this
[30:07] flesh right there right that's right
[30:10] so
[30:11] we go back to the garden
[30:13] there's your Redemption
[30:16] Body Spirit and soul that's right even
[30:19] the ones that are going on Sister Hazel
[30:21] one day she'll just come right up them
[30:22] grapes are not going to have to open up
[30:25] because remember it's a secret going
[30:27] away
[30:28] I always thought you know when you're a
[30:29] kid you think boy you say welcome to
[30:31] Resurrection takes place you you see all
[30:32] these Graves popped open you know no no
[30:34] he said it would be a secret right
[30:37] so you can go out there sister Hazel's
[30:39] Graven it'd be just pretty with flowers
[30:40] all over it and the rocks will be over
[30:42] the top of it but that person inside
[30:44] there won't be there right she'll come
[30:46] right up connect with that body God will
[30:49] change her and she'll walk among us at
[30:51] 20 years old once you see in those
[30:52] pictures out there right okay no shame
[30:55] to that huh
[30:57] coach they get their body changed before
[30:59] we do
[31:01] anyway yeah but it's got to come from
[31:03] somebody
[31:04] that believes in here because we got to
[31:07] believe for them Paul says they
[31:10] without us cannot be made perfect okay
[31:13] well
[31:16] we didn't get any reading done today
[31:21] let's read one
[31:23] let's just read one before we go page
[31:25] 92. sit back down I didn't dismissed
[31:32] actually it's page 91 paragraph two 38.
[31:39] we're going to read this one paragraph
[31:42] paragraph 238
[31:49] notice he was not an animal he took the
[31:51] book out of the right hand of him to
[31:52] stand on the throne who was it the owner
[31:54] the original owner
[31:56] that had the book of redemption in his
[31:58] right hand and no angel no Angelic being
[32:00] knew nothing else
[32:02] could take the place and this bloody
[32:04] lamb walked out and took the book out of
[32:06] his hand what was it brother this is the
[32:09] most Sublime thing in the scripture
[32:12] an act that not an angel not nothing can
[32:15] do it and the lamb comes and takes you
[32:16] from the right hand of him
[32:18] they sat on the throne
[32:20] one more one more thing just turn over
[32:23] to 92
[32:25] and we'll read backwards
[32:27] next time paragraph 244.
[32:31] now he was the title deed to Redemption
[32:34] he has it in his hand he's almost a lamb
[32:36] mediation is done now
[32:39] he has it in his hand remember it's been
[32:42] in the hand of God all the time
[32:44] but now it's in the hand of the Lamb who
[32:47] is the Lamb so now all right God of
[32:49] human flesh
[32:50] now watch the title deed of redemption
[32:52] of all creation
[32:54] all creation is in his hand
[32:58] and he comes to claim it back to for the
[33:02] human race human flesh when you say
[33:06] human it's flesh
[33:08] you can't be a human without having to
[33:09] flash that's right okay
[33:11] not claim it back to Angels
[33:15] claimed it back to the human
[33:19] now John was a human being standing on
[33:22] patland screaming how old in the world
[33:24] are we going to get this done he was
[33:26] born again in his soul not in his flesh
[33:28] right right
[33:31] which it was given for close let's go
[33:33] back claimed it back to the human which
[33:36] it was given for to make Sons and
[33:38] Daughters of God again bring them back
[33:41] to the Garden of Eden everything they
[33:43] lost
[33:44] the whole creation the trees the animals
[33:48] like everything else
