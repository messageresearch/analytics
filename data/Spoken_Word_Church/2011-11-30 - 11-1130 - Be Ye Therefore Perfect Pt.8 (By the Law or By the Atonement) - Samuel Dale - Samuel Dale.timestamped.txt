[5:36] and we thank you have your way now as we
[5:38] read the words you come in under the
[5:40] word by your presence in Jesus
[5:43] amen okay Matthew 537 we've been reading
[5:50] through 48 but let your communication
[5:54] baaaaa for whatsoever is more than these
[5:58] cometh of evil you heard that has been
[6:02] said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a
[6:03] tooth but I say unto you that ye resist
[6:06] not evil but whosoever shall smite thee
[6:11] on thy right cheek turn to him the other
[6:13] also and if any man shall shew thee at
[6:16] the law and take away thy coat let him
[6:19] have that cloak also whosoever shall
[6:22] compel thee to go my uncle with him
[6:24] Twain give to him that asketh thee and
[6:28] from him that would bar of the turn not
[6:31] thou away you have heard that it hath
[6:34] been said thou shalt love thy neighbor
[6:36] and hate thine enemy but I say unto you
[6:41] love your enemies bless them that curse
[6:43] you do good to them that hate you and
[6:45] pray for them which despitefully use you
[6:47] and persecute you that you may be the
[6:51] children of your father now remember how
[6:53] we brought it up you got the Beatitudes
[6:55] before this you know of what it is
[6:58] blessed is this blessing is this now
[7:00] he's laying down a pain to shorts it's
[7:03] going to move from that down from under
[7:07] those things he says we're blessed but
[7:09] then when it changes over he begins to
[7:12] talk about you know more like your life
[7:15] you know and in forgiving and going to
[7:18] my land you know and all like that wine
[7:22] first 45 seconds you may be the children
[7:24] of your father which is in heaven for he
[7:26] maketh the Sun to rise on the evil and
[7:29] on the good and Sun shineth running on
[7:31] the just and on the unjust for if you
[7:33] love them which love you what reward
[7:35] have you do not even the publicans
[7:36] society and if you salute your brethren
[7:39] only what do you more than others do not
[7:43] even the
[7:43] public and so after all of that saying
[7:46] putting it down i get these says be
[7:48] therefore perfect even as your father in
[7:51] heaven is perfect now he's telling us
[7:55] what it takes to be perfect and then God
[7:59] requires it takes the one to be able to
[8:03] forgive to do this etc etc right alright
[8:06] Hebrews 6 therefore leaving the
[8:07] principles of the doctrine of Christ let
[8:10] us go on to perfection not letting again
[8:12] the foundation of repentance from dead
[8:13] works and a fake toward God of the
[8:16] doctrine of baptisms and I'm laying on
[8:18] of hands and the resurrection of the
[8:20] Dead and of eternal judgment and this
[8:23] when we do if God premia teman they be
[8:25] seated the Lord is blessing to the
[8:28] reading of the word now we have been
[8:34] studying for quite a while be there for
[8:38] perfect and this makes about the eighth
[8:42] message if we've taken on this and I'm
[8:45] trying to get something to all of us and
[8:48] I know I'm mighty slowly and on like
[8:50] that but I I still you know when I was
[8:54] in school it took me a long time to
[8:56] learn my ABC's you know the kids now
[9:00] they know when they're 23 years old but
[9:02] we didn't have that then we were we was
[9:05] following them you around in the field
[9:07] we didn't know what the holiday bc's
[9:10] that anyway probably had a lot of other
[9:12] words we didn't know what they meant for
[9:14] the muse but still you know and we
[9:17] didn't learn to put them all together
[9:19] and with this kind of slope and that's
[9:21] the way I am in the gospel is this kind
[9:24] of slow brother mote used to talk about
[9:25] he's like a caddy and a grinding stone
[9:28] when you say they know where the world
[9:30] of the cat could take his tongue neither
[9:32] grindstone what it is because if he
[9:36] picked it off one brain fell off this
[9:38] tongue doctora coming back a few weeks
[9:41] later gets another grand after a while
[9:43] the holes don't come to it this takes a
[9:45] little while and you bear with me to try
[9:48] to get to you what I want to to say
[9:51] but now remember what we were doing and
[9:54] talking about that what is the
[9:56] difference between between the word
[9:59] perfect and the word perfection all
[10:05] right and in doing that I've tried to
[10:09] get you to see things and then we come
[10:11] along and then we reach pictures and
[10:13] things it looks like it's contrary in
[10:16] and we'll try to express that to you
[10:18] because I don't want you left dangling
[10:20] you know into a point but we went
[10:23] through for let the times of showing how
[10:26] that in the old testament did it says
[10:31] that no one was perfect the end about
[10:36] three times are in the book of Job it's
[10:38] a job was perfect well now are you argue
[10:42] with God about it are we going to take
[10:45] our carnality and peanut brains and I
[10:47] like to study because it pretty well
[10:49] sums it up and we're going to argue with
[10:51] God and say well now they wouldn't
[10:54] perfect well that's jobs comforters to
[10:58] see that was the guys that was giving
[11:00] him all the trouble they couldn't see it
[11:02] either and they were arguing about it
[11:04] but God said it he laid away Emma joke
[11:11] said I've made the atonement I've done
[11:14] what God told me to do he made the
[11:16] atonement even for his children dungeon
[11:20] okay God gave them to it alright so then
[11:23] it's not a point of wondering what it is
[11:25] but to compare that with the word
[11:28] perfect coming over yes we look at them
[11:32] and say they were not warned again we
[11:37] see the atonement is what made them
[11:39] perfect mmm may I know the question I'll
[11:41] ask you in a few minutes when we get
[11:43] down to something on on this but I want
[11:46] to make sure you follow me because the
[11:51] word perfect in the Old Testament we
[11:53] showed it in our saving these basically
[11:56] same meaning as the new testament work
[11:59] for perfect it's not a lot of difference
[12:02] in it it means like complete you know
[12:06] brought to an end by Matthew 548 it
[12:10] means to finish wanting nothing
[12:14] necessary to the completeness that which
[12:17] is perfect in other words full grown
[12:20] adult full age mature and I told you the
[12:25] reason that he is is because if you're
[12:27] going to use the word perfect if you
[12:31] could add anything to perfect then it
[12:36] was not perfect right I perfect means
[12:38] nothing can be added now perfect can be
[12:43] added to perfect right like I
[12:47] illustrated the statue of perfect man
[12:48] you have faith virtue knowledge
[12:50] temperance patience and but those are
[12:55] the same source you know what caused you
[13:01] to talk about the new earth the new
[13:04] birth makes you perfect in your soul and
[13:09] how human things out here in our bodies
[13:11] oh yeah but that has nothing to do with
[13:15] God because surely if he could say that
[13:18] job and Noah was perfect until Abraham
[13:22] to come and walk with human be perfect
[13:26] if you can do that under the blood of
[13:28] bulls and goats what about other the
[13:32] blood of Jesus Christ all right you know
[13:35] we know that the new birth is what you
[13:37] need to make you perfect right good it
[13:43] wouldn't matter what we tried to do we
[13:46] can't be perfect in our sales there's no
[13:50] leg to that we could be good enough
[13:52] probably said I hate in the Hebrews here
[13:55] hate to think that I was born five
[13:57] minutes ago and would I have to go to
[13:59] heaven upon some Mary or some
[14:01] form because I born in sin set into the
[14:05] nicholas batsman you know what for them
[14:07] a ladder all right now the child
[14:10] couldn't be guilty of doing anything
[14:12] that was five minutes old but his weight
[14:16] was born so if this morn long all right
[14:21] but if the blood of bulls and goats
[14:23] could make a man making the atonement
[14:27] and stand under the Toulmin and God
[14:31] would cover them and look at them and
[14:35] say I don't see talking about info so
[14:38] don't see their problems by let's say
[14:43] you don't look here look who I surely he
[14:45] said I don't see them why because you
[14:48] looking at the atonement they made all
[14:52] right so you never get down to the point
[14:54] of looking at the atonement in the
[14:56] correct order and bringing it out who
[15:00] will see what really perfect is perfect
[15:05] is so beautiful word you can add
[15:09] anything to it right it would mean it's
[15:11] not perfect I need to then perfect is
[15:17] more or less what God has done for us
[15:22] what he done for for Noah what he done
[15:25] for Joe what he done for the people of
[15:27] the Old Testament he covered their sins
[15:30] by the atonement did he required for
[15:34] them to make my crew that's right have
[15:37] any government all right he couldn't see
[15:40] their sin and it might not mean anything
[15:44] to you but not in the scripture where it
[15:48] refers to it and Joshua said said you
[15:53] put up with a map TM x new way to get
[16:00] the entire
[16:02] they were still headed to the promised
[16:04] land haven but when they got the case
[16:08] Barney on and they doubted God's Word
[16:12] through that profit then they were told
[16:15] they could not go in there man that's
[16:17] right is it all let's doubted it always
[16:21] been this way you're gonna die in the
[16:22] wilderness and said I'll raise up your
[16:26] children and take them Ian he did so he
[16:30] put up with all kind of things but he
[16:32] couldn't put up with the one thing that
[16:34] they finally done which was disbelief
[16:36] right nice to be able to keep his work
[16:39] all right now so then looking at the
[16:43] word perfect we we got to a little bit
[16:50] on the scripture but I want to pick up a
[16:53] few and just let you look at and just
[16:59] see what it means to be perfect and then
[17:04] we're going into to the perfection part
[17:07] all right so then looking at the
[17:12] scriptures let's just pick up a few
[17:15] let's go to Hebrews five and nine now
[17:21] let what you don't mcrainey when they
[17:23] when he get it no one cuz I gotta be
[17:26] honest to look in your Bible clip
[17:30] speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ
[17:34] Hebrews father none and being a perfect
[17:40] he became the author of eternal
[17:43] salvation of Homeland oh man being my
[17:46] perfect right now what does that mean
[17:52] about him when he was the perfect God
[18:00] he what did it what did it mean about
[18:03] him to say that being my perfect alright
[18:10] so there the definition of it is 154 ta
[18:17] is what won't I am going to get through
[18:19] this will just read down to it not a
[18:21] brother know Anderson a new give up the
[18:24] definition Hebrews 11 before he says God
[18:30] haven't provided some better thing for
[18:32] us that they without us should not be
[18:37] made perfect he says we're perfect in
[18:42] the new birth but then without us cannot
[18:48] be made perfect James do it with you
[18:55] think see us that how faith wrought with
[19:00] works and my works was faith made
[19:04] perfect 1st John 417 said hearing as our
[19:13] love made perfect we may have boldness
[19:17] of the day of judgment that's right
[19:19] because as he is are we in this world
[19:23] given as I love my perfect 1st John for
[19:28] 18 there is no fear in love but perfect
[19:30] love casts out fear because fear hath
[19:35] torment he that feareth is not my
[19:38] perfect in love so now that work perfect
[19:42] then I've tried to get this to you and
[19:45] you forgive me my dears to me that's
[19:47] having to be say ever done but no the
[19:52] word perfect then
[19:56] if I taught you and shown you that
[19:59] Martin Luther I believe had any work for
[20:03] the agency's living heaven John Wesley
[20:07] had a new earth the people back their
[20:09] head and you were for the age they were
[20:11] living but now it was not the growth
[20:14] development that's right as it would be
[20:19] compared to this age true because they
[20:23] were not responsible we get that new
[20:26] birth may imperfect emma is it made a
[20:33] perfect helping you anything else good
[20:38] see then your growth development would
[20:40] not be something extra added it would
[20:44] just me more of the same God our word
[20:48] revealed he said the word perfect starts
[20:53] off as a understanding I'll just is your
[20:59] sins are dropped off according to the
[21:04] Bible they're never to be remembered
[21:05] again right who would that be perfect
[21:09] and then see then we take the word
[21:15] perfect and we we take it at a low form
[21:18] and we begin to see how much Gregory
[21:20] gets the higher and higher it goes with
[21:24] its basic meaning all the way through is
[21:27] the son all right all of those is taken
[21:34] from 5048 now if you wound down to it
[21:39] you look what the word perfect there has
[21:42] meaning to perfect make perfect perfect
[21:47] finish full field be perfect consecrate
[21:53] to make perfect complete to carry
[21:58] through completely to accomplish finish
[22:03] bring to an end to complete perfect in
[22:07] other words and what is it won't in
[22:10] order to render a painful to be found
[22:15] perfect to bring to the end are the gold
[22:20] in other words the purpose to a
[22:23] conference in other words bring to a
[22:25] close of fulfillment by event the
[22:28] prophecies of the scriptures so then
[22:35] Jesus was made perfect he was made
[22:41] perfect by what suffering is that
[22:46] stretcher that's right and become the
[22:50] author she became to a full eight he was
[22:55] born too baby he couldn't die for our
[22:59] sins when he was baby you couldn't die
[23:01] for our sins when he was twelve years
[23:03] over the hour 14 or whatever with it we
[23:06] argued with the priest in the temple he
[23:11] entered his ministry in about 30 years
[23:13] of age and begin to go forth preaching
[23:17] and the Bible says being made perfect in
[23:22] other words he come to the fullest of
[23:25] the completion he came to the end of his
[23:30] Rodney the end of all things reached him
[23:35] it made him to be the one that would be
[23:38] perfect right when he didn't have to
[23:42] have anything to make it perfect are you
[23:45] listening that's what I try to stir you
[23:48] up with Holloway maybe it's perfectly
[23:51] well none of us perfect anyone whom
[23:54] Allah says you are we gave the quote for
[23:58] it run around and said if you're not
[24:00] perfect you're not going to heaven he
[24:05] said if you're not perfect you're lost
[24:09] because there is no wat blackbird
[24:11] there's no drunks over man there's no
[24:14] center site you're either a Christian or
[24:18] you're not a Christian you're either
[24:20] born again are not born again the
[24:24] foolish virgins is not born again they
[24:28] don't have eternal life so they're not
[24:31] perfect they're waiting for a time to be
[24:35] able to receive eternal life right and
[24:38] you know when they receive it then
[24:40] they'll be perfect but the born-again
[24:44] experience match the soul of the
[24:47] individual perfect and places with
[24:50] inside of us the one that can lead us
[24:53] into what we have the other the statue
[24:58] of a perfect man group development all
[25:01] right whatever it takes the end do we
[25:06] ask the question and that's why we read
[25:09] our in Matthew 5 48 oh that's the word
[25:13] perfect then we read over in Hebrew six
[25:15] now for leaving the principles of the
[25:17] doctrine of Christ let us go on to
[25:20] perfection we found out the word for
[25:24] faction it has a a great meaning to it
[25:32] you'd say well its growth development
[25:34] all right that's true well pull up that
[25:40] number of the jaw bone Hebrew six well
[25:44] the head he route 61 where we give the
[25:49] definition underneath so therefore
[25:53] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[25:55] oh crap let us go on unto perfection do
[26:00] not look at the meaning of the word
[26:01] perfection is a it's finisher
[26:08] a perfect her it's not referring to you
[26:15] and I because it's not referring to you
[26:18] and I of anything that made is perfect
[26:21] right God is the only one that can make
[26:25] this birthday he gave us a new earth
[26:28] amen so he gave us the perfecter it's
[26:34] the only way you drop the statue of a
[26:35] perfect man to be born again first and
[26:40] then through the opening the word we can
[26:43] attain unto these things listen
[26:46] perfecter now what one who have in his
[26:50] own person raised fate to its perfection
[26:54] so that would leave us out totally go we
[26:58] can't within our own person achieve any
[27:01] funny so now this is get the point what
[27:05] we were trying to get that Sunday move
[27:06] on and so set before us the highest
[27:11] example of faith there's only one
[27:17] perfect there's only one perfect and
[27:22] that we read to Sunday there were the
[27:26] probably said our perfection comes to
[27:28] Jesus Christ now like what brought him
[27:34] open always said and he said in Jesus
[27:36] Christ is the work I like that huh now
[27:44] let's read another scripture and will I
[27:47] want to ask you a question me Hebrews 7
[27:51] 11
[28:01] they're for perfection we're buying a
[28:04] little bit of cold priesthood for under
[28:07] it that people receive the law what
[28:11] further need was dire that another
[28:13] priest should rise after the order of
[28:15] Melchizedek and not be calm after the
[28:17] order of Darren now is there for
[28:23] perfection we're by the Levitical
[28:26] priesthood now read what's in Princeton
[28:31] to see Colette senior picture for under
[28:34] it men worked under the Levitical
[28:36] priesthood the people received the law
[28:42] all right now that work for faction is a
[28:46] basic same meaning of perfection of of
[28:50] Hebrew 61 but I could give these to this
[28:54] lets you look at it it's numbers 5050
[28:57] which means performance it means
[29:01] perfection a complete team
[29:09] a perfecting ing something going home it
[29:20] means fulfillment accomplishment the
[29:25] event which verifies the promise now
[29:32] Paul says Hebrews 6 wonder therefore
[29:37] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[29:39] of Christ let us alone to perfection
[29:48] what is he talking about is he talking
[29:54] about destroying the principles are
[29:57] keeping the principles as a foundation
[30:03] that's what I was trying to express our
[30:06] son deceive it sunday afternoon that
[30:14] perfection is dealing with the one
[30:18] inside of us to bring us to a place
[30:23] where as the new birth brothers to
[30:29] position us he turned wife mrs. growth
[30:33] development adoption a statue a perfect
[30:37] man you know had your faith virtue
[30:39] knowledge improv group development all
[30:42] right and then doing that we look back
[30:47] at the old testament we see that surely
[30:54] the only way they could be perfect with
[30:57] one thing
[31:00] now here's the question no listen
[31:10] where the old fashioned of people make
[31:13] perfect by the law are keeping it alone
[31:27] I'm pose for you to think where they
[31:32] make perfect by the law are keeping you
[31:34] the loan hardware they made perfect by
[31:41] the atonement mmm see which way
[31:52] if they could have been made perfect by
[31:54] keeping the Levitical law it would have
[31:58] not been necessary Paul says for another
[32:04] priesthood and develop right right and
[32:08] then if they could have been perfect my
[32:11] keeping the law you see that's what
[32:17] everybody thinks everybody thinks by
[32:22] keeping the lowest it makes you perfect
[32:24] Oh said what I felt was laughs all right
[32:32] they keep it alone the letter keeping it
[32:38] he said I found to be death
[32:46] right
[32:50] so were they I'm trying to express
[32:52] something new you'll see what Hall says
[32:54] leaving the principles of the doctors
[32:57] who cracks in the world so then if it
[33:02] was possible that they could be made
[33:04] perfect Paul says here in Hebrews 7 11
[33:09] that it would not be necessary that
[33:14] another priesthood come the priesthood
[33:20] of Aaron was fine for the time but it
[33:28] couldn't bring people to a place that
[33:34] they could she want God wanted
[33:45] the law Colin said is spiritual we said
[33:53] I'm carnal now what you say the law is
[33:59] the word of God you agree it is the word
[34:05] of God the 10 commandments that was the
[34:08] word of god it was God run around sit in
[34:12] letter form ma'am but to keep that long
[34:21] getting even atone
[34:30] good we did why would they go offer the
[34:32] offer you re listen if keeping of the
[34:39] law would make an atonement for you why
[34:45] would you making a tone right you see
[34:50] those Pharisees were so perfect in their
[34:55] life The Dispatch to the high priest if
[35:02] you found one mark or see them against
[35:03] that high priests they take them out
[35:05] killing his rent give your mommy a daddy
[35:10] grand blood red bug grow only all in the
[35:13] lineage everything that'll be perfect
[35:14] their land be exactly right because
[35:20] that's what they thought of the law will
[35:26] see that long as they keeping of the law
[35:28] could not make them perfect right had to
[35:35] keep another Lauren listening and to
[35:37] keep it up if the keeping of the law
[35:39] made a perfect there was no need to
[35:41] making her sacrifice see under the law
[35:48] they had to make a sacrifice Wright and
[35:52] they wouldn't dare have not made that
[35:57] receive a thought by keeping the law now
[36:04] I remind you of a rich young ruler they
[36:07] came to the Lord Jesus mission he had
[36:11] heard of him probably and saw on his
[36:14] life those things different and all many
[36:16] healings whatever he'd seen a little
[36:18] different in it and he came to Jesus one
[36:22] day and he said good master what can I
[36:27] do have eternal life
[36:33] you remember what Jesus was talking
[36:36] about doing the enema well keeping the
[36:40] commandments he said
[36:48] and the rich young ruler said I think
[36:53] it's john 5 he said I've kept this from
[36:57] my youth and the scripture says it Jesus
[37:05] left it you know why because he knew
[37:08] your fried right he knew what he was
[37:12] telling he was correct did he had kept
[37:16] the commandments Jesus didn't say that's
[37:20] gonna give you eternal life she keep
[37:28] another Commandments cannot bring life
[37:30] right keeping the other Commandments is
[37:37] what we read in the scripture about
[37:38] faith is made perfect by works which
[37:44] reason to giving those scriptures
[37:49] remember James and Paul looking like
[37:54] they were contrary but they were not one
[37:57] saying it looked like you say but work
[37:59] so it look like with my faith we come
[38:02] find out you're both in the same time
[38:04] right around city faith then give our
[38:14] works if I'll I don't match the Word of
[38:17] God there's no need to talking about
[38:20] that's right alright so now I'm not
[38:23] trying to destroy the law but I realize
[38:28] I know what the scripture says about it
[38:30] jesus said he come to magnify the Lord
[38:36] so you can't do away with something that
[38:38] is magnified you have to fight you
[38:43] magnified you bringing it all over in
[38:45] have a clear you your you do it now
[38:49] watch what I'm saying the law is perfect
[38:53] mmm you agree I meant the law was
[38:58] perfect because it was word of God right
[39:03] but the person putting their own
[39:06] interpretation upon it see and that's
[39:10] what the frack season almost say he sees
[39:13] no empowered they taught her perfection
[39:18] of keeping the law repose writings about
[39:28] it he said I found it out that it was
[39:32] death he said I'm a Pharisee of the
[39:37] ferric season he breathing he proved it
[39:38] under the law we set by English but he
[39:44] said I found that to be dead what the
[39:47] law no right his interpretation amen
[39:53] he's understanding a water all really
[39:58] loves you know the actual bill all would
[40:02] actually the bound said added because of
[40:04] transgressions that's right you know
[40:10] what the law actually done bein to begin
[40:14] to make a record under the law was a
[40:18] record keep eyes on the record keeper
[40:23] well they told you don't do this don't
[40:25] do that don't do this don't do that now
[40:30] it was perfect understand me with the
[40:34] person who done everything that it said
[40:36] or didn't do what it said don't feel
[40:39] another word you know it might be
[40:42] perfect
[40:47] let me do a person that we grieve the
[40:51] Hat round but it didn't make him perfect
[40:58] that's when it was not a fancy or a sack
[41:03] you see you know I'm talking about to
[41:04] the high elders the rulers etc they
[41:10] could make a statement like David there
[41:16] was an adulterer murderer Rena
[41:24] we said blessed the man whom God will
[41:26] not impute sin does that mean God like
[41:36] the way they picked hon they come on God
[41:41] is gone he can't like seeing he said
[41:46] David's a man after my own heart he said
[41:53] the example of my eye what I've always
[42:01] tried to get you to see one time David
[42:03] had something that most people didn't
[42:05] hire get an honest and a contra hour
[42:11] when he was condemned her sin irritated
[42:22] was it then he was a special some kind
[42:24] of a person there was he special in the
[42:29] basis that he repent now you see the
[42:37] establishment of them making that under
[42:42] the Old Testament it was not the keeping
[42:45] of the law that made the person perfect
[42:54] it was the atonement that God in the law
[43:01] it was a requirement for to be done so
[43:10] then if perfection were by the Levitical
[43:14] priesthood of this underneath the people
[43:20] receive the law what further need was
[43:22] there that another pre should rise after
[43:25] the order of Melchizedek not just lonely
[43:29] be called them bricks of Aaron he said
[43:37] what are you getting that we listened to
[43:42] you so far so what we get when you get
[43:43] it do you think that even by living the
[43:53] letter of the word to the letter will
[43:56] save you did you understand what I just
[44:02] like them living the word to the letter
[44:04] by the letter right in other words doing
[44:06] everything it said and only you think
[44:09] it's a he wouldn't save them it was
[44:17] necessary that another priesthood
[44:19] arrived the Jesus would be after the
[44:23] order of Melchizedek and a priesthood
[44:27] means that there's a different form of
[44:30] atonement to be made good on in a
[44:38] Levitical priesthood he told you what
[44:41] you offer a lamb Graham birds this snap
[44:43] the other he had it all the way now oh
[44:46] really in the Bible is on the Tim Tim
[44:49] parts to be called the law see we call
[44:51] the whole Old Testament law now on this
[44:54] Ten Commandments that's the wall the
[44:57] rest of it was writings about the law
[44:59] right the only existence of the law is
[45:03] the Ten Commandments man the others were
[45:07] ordinances and things that were handed
[45:09] down to the people for them to do under
[45:14] the existence of that and the law was
[45:20] headed because of transgression run
[45:24] around and said they did not get what
[45:26] they thought they got he said they
[45:29] thought they got a book of rules he said
[45:35] that they got God in letter form
[45:39] the runaround would even take the 10
[45:42] commandments and lay it in the seals and
[45:47] say they were the same is any possible
[45:54] way that anything that we could think of
[45:57] that would make us to where the god
[45:58] would save us or not prada God said if
[46:05] you think you've done anything that's
[46:07] right or haven't done anything that
[46:10] would make god save you he said Jesus
[46:13] Christ died in vain well you mean you
[46:19] don't want to be good for the deal now
[46:22] I'm honestly say if we can say we're
[46:26] gonna be good who live in person being
[46:31] good you know and doing what was right I
[46:37] listen brother David Gatlin haven't made
[46:39] a good point about being drugged you
[46:42] know drug your drugs are in hell but he
[46:45] said actually they got through draggin
[46:46] us all over him and beat the daylights
[46:48] out of they make good people out of its
[46:50] another words perforation when you said
[46:52] I stood with you won't save you right if
[47:00] you think there was anything you've done
[47:02] or didn't do is what saved you then
[47:08] Jesus Christ down in mind amen I didn't
[47:17] do I Gresham
[47:21] not still at your site and I never try
[47:24] that might be good I tried smoking I
[47:30] didn't care nothing about it and I mean
[47:33] I never did gosh how they want to keep
[47:44] my teeth where they're at no that's just
[47:48] true you know I freaking God that's why
[47:58] I can relate to what policy after all
[48:03] appalled fea that under the law would
[48:05] blindness and all the things he with her
[48:06] he said I'm the chiefest of sinners
[48:11] remember that you know I image the
[48:13] Chiefs the center because he was the
[48:15] closest to the truth i right that's
[48:19] right it's commendable that you've never
[48:24] drank you've never done this real ever
[48:26] done that that's collectible but did
[48:30] your profits it like this he said now
[48:32] sisters don't type because it you've got
[48:35] a long dress and along her but it means
[48:40] you're going to have it that's right
[48:42] yeah d
[48:49] alright so there was no way under the
[48:54] Old Testament are the only way on the
[48:59] old testament of being perfect was to
[49:01] make the atonement right and the law
[49:09] told you what a Coleman tomato I mean
[49:11] you know under the writings and funny
[49:12] they were told what to do you know he
[49:15] got on her dad right said to be more
[49:18] perfect for making that that's what I've
[49:20] been trying to get but was it the law
[49:23] that saved them earthy aroma that same
[49:26] that right that's the time of the
[49:28] message is it the law order is it to do
[49:31] the atonement p.c brother Dale you dont
[49:40] preach like everybody help I agree we
[49:44] but is it the truth what's that got to
[49:49] do it and they love reach life is it the
[49:51] truth of what I'm saying mmm the law
[49:54] can't say you they couldn't say them no
[49:58] that's right and they keep it to the
[50:00] wall can't save you now all right well
[50:03] do you mean it's better for us to go out
[50:05] live like the devil I didn't say that
[50:07] why would you think right when I just
[50:12] got to say that even in the world I
[50:13] didn't drink never did have no trouble
[50:18] with drinking sit down beside of
[50:22] somebody after i got saved and they
[50:26] start drinking the beer that you're
[50:27] hunting club within i just set their
[50:31] dime I can close my mouth and start
[50:33] wandering you wouldn't do that when i
[50:36] saw this when i saw seven cuz i thought
[50:41] it was garbage games he goes the devil
[50:45] at night to me man he already had me
[50:47] right when i listen
[50:51] so Paul says the end the code of the New
[50:54] Testament now you listening to the
[50:59] pointer under the Old Testament they
[51:01] made the atonement drive event and
[51:03] that's what covered them in mail perfect
[51:06] all right little Levitical priesthood
[51:09] ended run around set of Calvary all
[51:12] right you know that Jesus even came
[51:15] under the law the Bible says to redeem
[51:17] them that one of the law when he would
[51:20] heal somebody he'd say go offer the
[51:23] sacrifice of motion but he was still he
[51:26] went under the law he came to fulfill
[51:30] the law to the letter because it no man
[51:35] could keep it see then they would have
[51:41] to be another priesthood which will
[51:46] leave the priesthood of Melchizedek
[51:49] which is Jesus Christ well Reverend said
[51:51] we see no more of milk Chesney he said
[51:54] because he became Jesus cried all right
[51:56] all right so then if there was a new
[51:59] testament they would have to be a new
[52:01] covenant and being a new covenant they
[52:04] would have to be a new atonement see the
[52:12] ax told me of the atonement of the New
[52:14] Testament is the body of Jesus Christ
[52:18] you agree he became a sacrifice for you
[52:23] and I in his flesh Paul said he took
[52:29] upon him the sins of man and paid the
[52:33] price and being made perfect that's why
[52:38] I love it those animals are best they
[52:40] could do you know that they would even
[52:41] the fact that the red heifer can have
[52:44] three as many as three what hires in it
[52:47] and still be counted perfect they can
[52:52] have as many as three wires in it and
[52:54] still be counted perfect that's the
[52:55] Levitical law you seeing Jesus Christ
[52:59] there was no three tires
[53:02] he's the perfect two dominant not only
[53:06] then I have an eternal atonement when
[53:11] who died rose and went to Gloria needs
[53:13] my atonement that's why the Bible says
[53:15] that he is our advocate Jesus Christ the
[53:19] righteous he became as we've read these
[53:25] definitions he became a cola fulfillment
[53:29] now all the things he became the end who
[53:33] remember the Bible said Christ at the
[53:35] end of the law for righteousness and
[53:41] love people don't like the last night
[53:42] that either everybody said all the law
[53:44] ended back there if you're not born to
[53:48] be and you're still under the wall
[53:51] that's right let's crash to the end of
[53:53] the law for righteousness for them that
[53:56] are saved right man the world so under
[54:00] the law and will be condemned by the
[54:02] light right I bet you thought of that
[54:05] man only violent you were remember the
[54:09] way that I preached hit the way out
[54:10] later than you believe what you'll do
[54:12] but I leave under the Old Testament it
[54:15] wasn't everybody that was covered by the
[54:17] blood they was covered by the fact of
[54:19] keeping them from being destroyed
[54:20] because that was the atonement that was
[54:23] made uri we just become somebody drove
[54:26] away much slammed it down and said
[54:28] effort for me i'm going back nude again
[54:29] he wasn't forgiven it was only those of
[54:34] an honest in the contrite heart right
[54:37] now that was that way under the Old
[54:39] Testament what about the New Testament
[54:40] yeah man well they don't make no
[54:43] difference what I did I'm a Christian
[54:46] that's the madness doctrine once saved
[54:49] always sunny you know which I don't
[54:55] believe what's truly born again always
[55:01] going to be in heaven but not just
[55:05] because you say you're saying
[55:11] but the low having a shadow of good
[55:16] things the scripture says to come can
[55:19] never make the comer perfect because it
[55:23] is nothing to be able to get into this
[55:25] rock that night right a man right the
[55:30] blood of bulls and goats and animal life
[55:31] in the number so we can come back none
[55:34] of the New Testament now we have not
[55:36] only the high priest of our confession
[55:41] we have not only the one who can pay the
[55:45] price we have the one who can come and
[55:49] live in us right all right now becoming
[55:57] Leah Venice then we can think about
[56:01] going on to perfection and pulse it but
[56:06] now let's get over to where we are you
[56:08] notice that in turn anybody yet so we
[56:10] forget that it is free so when you come
[56:17] into the New Testament by the new birth
[56:22] is the only way you're in a New
[56:23] Testament that's when you do it by turn
[56:26] the first book of the New Testament
[56:27] they'll automatically turn to Matthew
[56:29] that's not the first book of the New
[56:31] Testament the book of Acts is the first
[56:33] book of the New Testament Jesus was
[56:35] still under the law here in Matthew Mark
[56:37] Luke and John Durrani but they listen
[56:43] all set there for leaving the principles
[56:46] of the doctrine of crime let us go on to
[56:50] perfection not laying again the
[56:53] foundation of networks he come and I ask
[56:57] you to read Hebrews look around where he
[57:00] preached Hebrews 6 selling not do that
[57:02] in the Hebrew book you'll hear bread
[57:06] around explaining that even the one God
[57:09] the water baptism
[57:11] no eternal hell and all that is carnal
[57:13] reform now how can any corner reforming
[57:22] is the word of God what is he talking
[57:24] about he's talking about to me now the
[57:29] same thing at the Old Testament know the
[57:32] law was spiritual it was the Word of God
[57:36] but by their interpretation and they're
[57:41] keeping of the law they thought it made
[57:43] him righteous put it in the atonement
[57:52] their only cover them you couldn't take
[57:55] it away so Paul what are you saying
[57:58] right around them what do you say should
[58:01] we get rid of the understanding of one
[58:03] God can we get rid of the understanding
[58:06] of no eternal hell and Tirpitz II know
[58:10] right all sit there for leaving the
[58:13] principles the beginning in other words
[58:20] don't stay on that's where the trouble
[58:24] in the Old Testament they went year by
[58:26] year by year by year by year by year for
[58:32] thousands of years doing the same thing
[58:39] you agree
[58:42] but when a tire changed in any form
[58:44] whatsoever that's why the when they come
[58:49] to Jesus I said we are Moses disciples
[58:53] yep he said young but Moses spoke a
[58:59] minute yeah right you know what did only
[59:03] Kelly would come in right they killed
[59:07] him because he was what Moses said now
[59:17] do you think that because that you
[59:21] didn't do anything no you didn't go out
[59:27] and commit see him that was the reason
[59:32] God saved you right cuz he had to save
[59:39] them because you take the difference
[59:45] between the old testament in the new and
[59:48] if you don't have the multiplication are
[59:50] magnifying of it you know none of the
[59:52] old testament to look at a woman unless
[59:54] factory wouldn't that come on wouldn't
[1:00:00] then but to commit adultery could be
[1:00:06] dead right d so they were doing better
[1:00:12] than we are cuz under the new testament
[1:00:15] is amplified look on a woman to lust
[1:00:18] after in the art you committed adultery
[1:00:19] already with her but what's Paul staying
[1:00:25] back for leaving the principles that's
[1:00:28] what I'm trying to get it to you with a
[1:00:29] point then wrong that's the question was
[1:00:32] it the atonement that made imperfect or
[1:00:35] was it the keeping of the law that made
[1:00:37] a perfect I tried
[1:00:41] is Paul saying go on to perfection in
[1:00:45] other words we find that bread rancid
[1:00:47] don't do this I'll take care of that
[1:00:50] didn't do that door let me sit do this
[1:00:54] okay I'll go do that I listening so much
[1:01:00] legalism until that's right nerd I'm
[1:01:03] industry that's why this church started
[1:01:07] I've heard people preach you to hell
[1:01:09] because you toward out advice defense
[1:01:13] Nikita quote smart would you don't want
[1:01:18] which kids we didn't Arthur have a pass
[1:01:20] defense you know what cuz if cow got out
[1:01:23] you don't put the counter usual
[1:01:25] offensive DN usually whooping rounded
[1:01:34] have to tell me I'm tired out
[1:01:36] apostrophes yeah yeah you didn't have to
[1:01:42] tell me dr. Grady come on dude
[1:01:50] what I'm trying to get me you to look at
[1:01:53] I'll said leaving the principles right
[1:01:57] let us go on to perfection because
[1:02:05] whether or not we keeping the message is
[1:02:07] not what sir the price paid for seeing
[1:02:11] he made the atonement he paid the price
[1:02:18] agree well you just might be destroyed
[1:02:24] like the devil if you live like today
[1:02:26] where you are the devil any problem come
[1:02:33] on you live life in there where you are
[1:02:36] the devil let's just meet up no problem
[1:02:39] with anybody usually no couldn't even
[1:02:44] leave soon well then you're not born
[1:02:47] again I said that simple enough you're
[1:02:54] just not going to get ready to don't
[1:02:55] continue you said your conscience see
[1:03:03] Paul is not saying throw away these
[1:03:05] things but he's saying these things were
[1:03:13] what the Old Testament people done to
[1:03:15] faint make them righteous that's what
[1:03:21] you see in the message today that's
[1:03:24] right you see the preachers preaching
[1:03:27] leave a list big bangs don't cut your
[1:03:31] heart don't you fight if you got to tell
[1:03:33] somebody that's been in this message one
[1:03:35] year one year I'll give that much
[1:03:37] scratch yeah I didn't say good morning I
[1:03:42] said you've been in this message one
[1:03:44] year and you listen to tapes you know
[1:03:48] better than to cut your heart paint your
[1:03:50] face that's right yeah right
[1:03:55] right come on you know you're all did it
[1:04:05] Moran said holy you don't have to have a
[1:04:07] Holy Ghost be condemned over lifetime
[1:04:12] you mean you said I need to hold it goes
[1:04:14] keep me from committing adultery with
[1:04:16] you something wrong with you conscious
[1:04:22] of a moral obligation or to keep you
[1:04:24] from doing that you know hip and soul
[1:04:31] but you see ya way I look at it I see
[1:04:35] the people of the message trying to
[1:04:37] reach perfection because I hear them
[1:04:41] today is preaching the same thing they
[1:04:44] freeze 40 years ago that's right and i
[1:04:50] know i conned that phrase out of it one
[1:04:52] time if you get in every round woman is
[1:04:54] your lab work in the gospel whether he
[1:04:55] slipped or what he said he had to make a
[1:04:58] study when he said it is your wife worth
[1:04:59] your the gospel i heard people preach if
[1:05:08] we got the women on it with lead for the
[1:05:10] retro then I've heard that she shall be
[1:05:16] saved in childbearing belongs you
[1:05:20] sisters bad kid you're saved you said
[1:05:24] you've heard that out of people that
[1:05:25] makes it yes and you have to maybe you
[1:05:27] slept them like these late ma'am don't
[1:05:29] remember it listen to my speech to you
[1:05:33] somewhere you see what's being said
[1:05:37] probably you coming after me they threw
[1:05:39] the service and they'd ask me questions
[1:05:41] about are you afraid to ask somebody a
[1:05:45] question right
[1:05:48] you killing ask me I'll tell you exactly
[1:05:51] what I'm done bad but it's like I've
[1:05:53] always say it if I'm talking about you
[1:05:55] and you come and ask me am I talking
[1:05:57] that you gonna tell you I'm talking
[1:05:58] about you okay see that way most people
[1:06:03] won't come and ask you because they're
[1:06:04] afraid you'll tell you that you're
[1:06:06] talking about them move why not nobody
[1:06:09] want to be right too when I see it two
[1:06:12] factions I see two ways that Satan
[1:06:15] perverts and cool and I look at it is
[1:06:18] the Old Testament people of what they
[1:06:20] were doing right they thought that they
[1:06:23] buy not breaking the law made in saved
[1:06:31] so that's what I see most people think
[1:06:33] today then if they're not breaking them
[1:06:38] all the word the thanks Brett around see
[1:06:40] it you know all of that that that might
[1:06:44] some sunny where did Jesus Christ what
[1:06:49] did you see I far you know I thought we
[1:06:56] were posed to believe that works his
[1:06:58] faith expressed you know I thought we
[1:07:02] broke to believe just to Gail that the
[1:07:05] Christian life was to be an automatic
[1:07:07] process from inside of us Evan that's
[1:07:12] what i was talking about on the Hebrews
[1:07:13] 6 where it refers to the perfection that
[1:07:18] that's the same word of referring to
[1:07:20] Jesus about his perfection and being
[1:07:24] made perfect he came to the position
[1:07:26] that he could enter into us and live his
[1:07:30] life through us and bring to us the
[1:07:33] things of his nature
[1:07:39] I thought that's what we were I thought
[1:07:44] Christianity was crash living in on site
[1:07:50] but I said two groups one group thanks I
[1:07:54] do the best that I can do i do the best
[1:07:58] i can be real they'll try everything you
[1:08:02] all again I just hope out either then
[1:08:10] the other side says well the Bible says
[1:08:18] of David blessed is the man to whom God
[1:08:21] won't have you seen God loves me so much
[1:08:23] he won't impute ropes into me trying to
[1:08:25] sleep like the devil and this my
[1:08:27] lid yeah now I don't believe neither one
[1:08:33] will try know everybody say it today in
[1:08:41] all of the ways of doing you hear them
[1:08:43] and they keep saying we're looking to
[1:08:45] people that message you're just falling
[1:08:47] away the people the message is not
[1:08:50] falling away the mixed multitude the
[1:08:55] mixed multitude is what's falling away
[1:08:58] man that's right i'm in a revival I've
[1:09:01] been in a revival ever since I've been
[1:09:03] in this message 4700 there's never been
[1:09:09] a dull day and me and the word all right
[1:09:12] all right
[1:09:15] rejoice daily and what it reveals to me
[1:09:21] I'm having a good time in the word right
[1:09:28] would you see the mixed multitude is
[1:09:32] what got Israel in trouble study your
[1:09:33] Bible in concordance mixed multitude and
[1:09:37] legal background you see what domina
[1:09:38] right there was a mixed multitude it got
[1:09:40] Israel in trouble this is the mixed
[1:09:46] multitude around the bride of Jesus
[1:09:47] Christ it keeps everything on last night
[1:09:49] yep but those that are born again are
[1:09:54] going right down the line they're
[1:09:55] hindered yes yes hindered right because
[1:10:01] if they don't hold they don't have
[1:10:03] somebody to teach you what perfection
[1:10:06] really is but so they think that is
[1:10:13] keeping the message well now remember
[1:10:18] the old testament if that would write
[1:10:20] that under the ernet priesthood of
[1:10:23] keeping the law Paul said there was no
[1:10:26] need for another priesthood to come
[1:10:29] right because you would have been
[1:10:33] perfect with what you know that folks is
[1:10:37] not another priesthood to come in this
[1:10:39] nice day yo man come on don't ever get
[1:10:42] mental thoughts in my mind there's not
[1:10:45] another priesthood to come because we're
[1:10:48] the priesthood always coming a message
[1:10:50] and the Lord Jesus came with a message
[1:10:52] right he was the living example amen
[1:10:58] brother and said perfect face that he
[1:11:01] live in a world of perfect thing all by
[1:11:04] himself he said he's at all and we could
[1:11:08] just live in that world of perfect thing
[1:11:16] do you think it makes you a Christian to
[1:11:19] not do wrong is that what you think you
[1:11:26] do I'll get saved get born again and
[1:11:33] they let the one this inside of you live
[1:11:38] and you never rot life Jesus not had any
[1:11:45] trouble with drinking again let's move
[1:11:47] to run around women it's their room I
[1:11:48] don't trouble the only dude well after
[1:11:53] you put him in us i thought that the
[1:11:55] prophet said that you could take a pig
[1:11:58] and he said its nature is to rutland
[1:12:01] welcome of it no wonder he said what you
[1:12:04] put the nature of a lamb inside that did
[1:12:07] he said that people go on the side of
[1:12:10] the hill t green rice now he says
[1:12:13] explaining the new earth right then if
[1:12:19] Christ is in you and me working any
[1:12:25] problem with the living well then you
[1:12:28] don't ever have to metro i doing wrong
[1:12:30] every day you win quote your prophet he
[1:12:35] said he did he said he seemed they were
[1:12:38] doing though would you see every day
[1:12:42] I've gotten a part of me that says Lord
[1:12:46] forgive
[1:12:49] now laid out at night and I'm not a
[1:12:51] prayer warrior I'm sorry never been that
[1:12:54] way but sometimes going to answer is my
[1:12:58] priority on that all right but I'm just
[1:13:01] not what's called a prayer warrior I lay
[1:13:04] down at night I said lord I love you so
[1:13:10] thank you for saving more than 0 been
[1:13:14] wrong today to give me you just make me
[1:13:20] what you want cuz I'm gonna be riding
[1:13:24] horse I want you to live that's it
[1:13:29] that's it did you see sometimes you hear
[1:13:33] it for her we got the word Sunday that
[1:13:36] Alan Richard was sitting in a traffic
[1:13:38] jam before you got the word out either
[1:13:42] 18 minutes later the traffic jam was
[1:13:44] coming at 1am I just asked a simple
[1:13:47] little prayer Lord clear that one guy
[1:13:52] with a yellow you know sometimes hears
[1:13:57] our prayers when I found out a long time
[1:14:01] ago is not only loud hard streaming
[1:14:03] prayers he's got here but I thought we
[1:14:08] believe about Elijah they wouldn't a
[1:14:09] whirlwind and the hunger for my
[1:14:11] lightning tonight and I thought it was a
[1:14:13] still small voice out of him that
[1:14:20] but you see they could not condemn the
[1:14:25] Lord Jesus in his life but they condemn
[1:14:32] him about what he called his teaching
[1:14:39] and him saying that he was God therefore
[1:14:51] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[1:14:53] of Christ let us go into perfection
[1:15:00] first get the Perfector inside of us and
[1:15:04] then let him live outwardly and us just
[1:15:08] keep praying the word that's what I told
[1:15:11] you that I would bring you a little bit
[1:15:13] about the Statue a perfect man but I
[1:15:14] don't see any need of what I'm doing
[1:15:16] because i preciate so long to you you
[1:15:20] can't wind up and say I need knowledge
[1:15:22] and you study the message you don't get
[1:15:24] it I need difference no I need patient
[1:15:29] through a bottle Central Asia working
[1:15:31] patient to line it up we just take a
[1:15:32] well with each other come on I won't
[1:15:37] bring perfection right but that's what
[1:15:41] they thought right that's what mankind
[1:15:44] is always thought that they had to be
[1:15:47] some way that we could be good enough
[1:15:50] are not be guilty and then God would
[1:15:55] save us I told you from said anyone do
[1:15:59] matching age is before I could never say
[1:16:02] I knew what would bring the virtuous and
[1:16:06] they still you know I couldn't to try to
[1:16:08] find out what it was the Lord spoke to
[1:16:10] them and said it only can come by the
[1:16:13] revealing about a word that's what I'm
[1:16:17] trying to do tonight that's why I do
[1:16:20] ever service and try to bring something
[1:16:22] this is not a six and seven sermon it
[1:16:26] may sound like I preached it 40 years
[1:16:28] ago 20 years ago
[1:16:30] but you check it out you find out where
[1:16:33] climate is a little higher each time I
[1:16:34] had a chat with some of these just going
[1:16:37] back and listening with a marquee my
[1:16:41] mother said it covered might get him in
[1:16:42] trouble but I don't mean wrong with
[1:16:45] brother Mark II love this message I
[1:16:47] preached on a sick seal he said he
[1:16:50] didn't know any time he listened to it
[1:16:51] so he went down he had that banquet in
[1:16:53] Word form in the apologize to mr. don't
[1:16:57] apologize I wish it all in work for but
[1:17:00] I said don't tell everybody Vatican
[1:17:01] everybody going to copy you know so it's
[1:17:04] going college teen yeah you make a copy
[1:17:06] farm for them to be able to do it we'll
[1:17:09] see he could do there's a bit around
[1:17:12] here all these years the key that we
[1:17:14] just keep climbing a little higher and
[1:17:16] louder all right it hasn't been this to
[1:17:20] six and seven tournaments what I mean by
[1:17:22] six and seven is go to church in the
[1:17:24] next week you heard the sign honey we
[1:17:26] need to be perfect but take none of us
[1:17:28] perfect so I guess we just need to not
[1:17:30] go perfect they've none of us we take
[1:17:31] none no none do it no not one I thought
[1:17:39] we believe the Bible in the Prophet said
[1:17:41] that God was coming after a bride that
[1:17:44] was without spot wrinkle or blemish now
[1:17:52] is keeping the law gonna do that or is
[1:17:58] it the revealing of God's Word effect
[1:18:01] cause remember with the new priesthood
[1:18:05] comes a new atoma you remember the
[1:18:10] background for this when I was streaking
[1:18:13] about how did Moses run before God and
[1:18:20] sit prefetcher I may make it at home
[1:18:25] yep now what animal did he carry up he
[1:18:29] did incur in the well read your mama
[1:18:31] that's right next to this 32 the
[1:18:35] internal animal he cared the word
[1:18:38] college cuz he reminded god what he said
[1:18:45] he reminded god of what he had said his
[1:18:51] word is the atonement today that's right
[1:18:56] the atonement was made for all of our
[1:18:59] sins right but then the Prophet had
[1:19:06] become to give us the grace of marriage
[1:19:08] in the board at the words of a man an
[1:19:16] atonement is made for you and I it's not
[1:19:23] keeping the law that saves you the
[1:19:27] atonement but then if we don't live the
[1:19:32] law as close as we can then we just
[1:19:37] proved me wrong you see somebody here
[1:19:42] cutting the harm paint in their face a
[1:19:46] little makeup complaining LOL alright
[1:19:50] you cool you see somebody doing that
[1:19:53] just look at him and go I'm done with
[1:19:54] your long supporting brother Dale and I
[1:19:58] still get you in trouble in May in
[1:19:59] trouble but that's on I don't
[1:20:04] believe in living you stink on life I
[1:20:09] believe in the living the best we can
[1:20:13] but everyday plead the atonement off if
[1:20:22] they asked him said those Christians
[1:20:24] have sins he said they're only one only
[1:20:27] ones who have seen is Christian you said
[1:20:33] well he did say that about boiling it he
[1:20:35] said Christians and then they asked him
[1:20:38] that he sinned and he said everybody so
[1:20:42] now that must be Christians on the
[1:20:45] increases but you see is true the
[1:20:52] preaching of the gospel that the growth
[1:20:54] development can come into the bride of
[1:20:56] Jesus Trey wise people fraid of Daniel
[1:21:01] seventy weeks seals predestination
[1:21:03] marriage and divorce one God minds are
[1:21:08] so much confusion about
[1:21:18] could we we're trying to perfect
[1:21:20] ourselves
[1:21:27] if we think keeping along with what we
[1:21:29] save us then we're no different in Old
[1:21:33] Testament people but if we think we can
[1:21:38] live like the devil and get by with it
[1:21:41] relies is that plain enough didn't you
[1:21:49] know what brother they'll believe I
[1:21:52] believe in living right but I believe in
[1:21:56] being born again and let him crash live
[1:21:58] on you because none of us can keep the
[1:22:01] word that was their problem in the Old
[1:22:05] Testament they couldn't keep the law it
[1:22:08] was a record keeper of them that's why
[1:22:13] when we get there when these days we've
[1:22:15] ever remember the other day when there's
[1:22:17] expressing that dark two judgments one
[1:22:20] is the judgments of the deep done in
[1:22:22] your body where they're good or bad and
[1:22:23] that's the bride of Jesus Christ the
[1:22:25] other one is a white throne judgment
[1:22:26] that the bride does not sit before but
[1:22:29] she sets own and watch from judgment to
[1:22:31] judge those standing before but there is
[1:22:33] a judgment that it needs done in the
[1:22:35] body whether good or bad when we
[1:22:40] deciding eternal life it could be ruined
[1:22:45] Wars
[1:22:50] to see even like my brother said when I
[1:22:52] we're about rewards longer I get tired
[1:22:54] Wilma that's a good point oh that's a
[1:22:59] good point but why would we want to live
[1:23:02] anything other then let it crash within
[1:23:05] us right why would we want to depend on
[1:23:09] Leo to find other than Christ in you
[1:23:11] know little glowy why would we more to
[1:23:18] do anything other than let them crush
[1:23:21] this come and lil out of us and that's
[1:23:25] what it says perfection did letting that
[1:23:27] one come in of us who had already
[1:23:29] reached that place maybe have come and
[1:23:32] live in unless to take no start what
[1:23:35] about make on these honey listening to
