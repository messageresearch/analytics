[1:49] little time
[1:50] to kind of cover the offices and things

[1:58] it
[1:59] yeah if you want to come you can still
[2:00] come we would like for you to do that
[2:03] all right brother boyd's and sister
[2:05] monica's class
[2:07] will be practicing today at 12 45
[2:10] so remember that any other announcements
[2:13] i always miss a miss one or two or
[2:17] something you know but anyhow
[2:19] all right let's go to our scripture
[2:21] matthew
[2:22] 24. if you notice we're not going to
[2:25] first peter
[2:26] okay now i want to say this
[2:32] just to where everybody's here and
[2:34] thinking i
[2:36] told you i was going to stop the series
[2:40] on at the revelation of jesus christ
[2:43] i didn't say i ended it i didn't say it
[2:46] was done
[2:47] i just brought it to a halt because
[2:49] really
[2:50] technically i had caught up with wade
[2:53] and that there was no need of both of us
[2:55] in the same
[2:56] pattern moving into revelations
[3:00] four five six and all like that so
[3:03] i chose to back out for a little while
[3:07] and uh let him continue on in that
[3:10] to where that he can bring out the
[3:12] things that he sees about the seals etc
[3:15] and things like
[3:16] yeah but don't ever think that we
[3:18] stopped
[3:19] so you keep thinking on one thing
[3:22] now this may strike you and i'll just
[3:25] read the scripture
[3:27] because i thought about doing this today
[3:30] and then
[3:30] when i come back into it after wade
[3:33] moves on a while
[3:34] upward then you'll see we'll drop right
[3:37] back in where we're at
[3:38] after revelation of jesus christ and go
[3:42] right back up to try to catch up with
[3:43] him again
[3:44] because that'll that's the way that it's
[3:47] laying out in
[3:48] what that the way i chose to minister
[3:52] there's a very odd scripture
[3:55] in your bible first corinthians 15 28
[4:02] and when all things shall be subdued
[4:05] unto him
[4:07] there then shall the son also himself
[4:11] be subject unto him that put all things
[4:15] under him that god may be all
[4:19] in all you'll see us pick up right there
[4:23] and carry on a thought as we're going
[4:25] upward
[4:26] but we're into matthew 24
[4:29] and then we'll go to leviticus 25
[4:33] okay may the lord have his blessing
[4:35] father we thank you for everything
[4:38] let your love be with us today and let
[4:40] your light shine in our hearts
[4:42] that we may see you and god each and
[4:44] every one of us
[4:45] we love you and we thank you you
[4:47] promised in your word that you come and
[4:48] heal us and deliver
[4:50] and we believe you have and we ask you
[4:52] to just
[4:53] make it manifest throughout all of the
[4:55] people that
[4:57] lord we can our healings can come our
[5:00] things
[5:01] to where that we know satan's fighting
[5:03] on every hand
[5:04] but yet you promise to raise up a
[5:06] standard we love you
[5:07] and we thank you in jesus name amen
[5:12] 24 32. now learn a parable
[5:17] now if you notice we're right back into
[5:20] the point but listen
[5:22] now learn the parable of the fig tree
[5:24] when his branch is yet tender and
[5:26] putteth forth leaves
[5:28] you know that summer is nigh so likewise
[5:31] ye
[5:32] when ye shall see all these things
[5:36] know that it is near even at the doors
[5:41] verily i say unto you this generation
[5:43] shall not pass
[5:45] till all these things be fulfilled now
[5:48] what things
[5:49] heavens and earth shall pass away
[5:52] but my word shall not pass away but of
[5:55] that day
[5:56] an hour knoweth no man no not
[5:59] the angels of heaven but my father only
[6:04] but as the days of noah were so shall
[6:07] also the coming of the son of man
[6:10] be for as in the days that were
[6:13] before the flood they were eating and
[6:15] drinking marrying and giving in marriage
[6:17] until today
[6:18] that noah entered into the ark and you
[6:22] not
[6:22] until the flood came and it
[6:25] took them all away so shall also the
[6:28] coming of the son of man be
[6:30] then shall be two in the field one
[6:34] should be taken
[6:35] the other left two women grinding one
[6:37] taken one left watch therefore okay
[6:40] now let's go over to leviticus because
[6:42] this is
[6:43] where we'll pick up our thought
[6:47] leviticus 25
[6:51] and the lord spake unto moses in mount
[6:53] sinai i say
[6:54] speak unto the children of israel and
[6:56] say unto them when you come into the
[6:58] land which i give you
[7:00] you shall then shall the land keep a
[7:03] sabbath
[7:04] unto the lord now watch what's land
[7:06] people
[7:07] land people okay six years shall not
[7:10] sold
[7:11] i feel in six years shall i prune thy
[7:14] vineyard
[7:15] and gather in the fruit thereof but in
[7:17] the seventh year
[7:18] shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land
[7:22] a sabbath for the lord thou shalt
[7:25] neither sow
[7:26] thy field nor prune thy vineyard that
[7:29] which
[7:30] groweth of its own accord of thine
[7:33] harvest
[7:34] thou shalt not reap it is neither gather
[7:37] the grapes without vine undressed
[7:40] for it is a year of rest unto the land
[7:44] and the sabbath of the land shall be
[7:46] meat for you
[7:47] for thee and for thy servant and for thy
[7:51] maid
[7:51] and for thy hired servant and thy
[7:54] stranger
[7:55] that shall join us with in other words
[7:56] everybody's going to participate
[7:58] okay whatever it be within your
[8:00] household
[8:01] all right and for that cattle and for
[8:03] thy beasts that are in the land
[8:05] shall all the increase thereof be meat
[8:08] see you can't go
[8:09] out put your sickle in and harvest to
[8:12] sell or to do but they can just go out
[8:15] and eat what's left
[8:17] you know all right now watch thy shalt
[8:21] number seven
[8:21] sabbaths of years unto thee seven times
[8:24] seven years
[8:26] and the space of the seven sabbaths of
[8:28] years shall be unto thee forty and nine
[8:30] years
[8:31] then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the
[8:33] jubilee
[8:34] to sound on the tenth day of the seventh
[8:37] month
[8:37] now you've stopped your rest of the land
[8:41] now where you're at people
[8:45] and shalt thou cause the trumpet of the
[8:46] jubilee to sound on the tenth day
[8:48] of the seventh month in the day of the
[8:50] atonement so you make the trumpet sound
[8:52] throughout
[8:53] all your land and you shall hallow the
[8:55] 50th year and proclaim liberty
[8:57] throughout all the land
[8:59] unto all the inhabitants thereof it
[9:01] shall be a jubilee
[9:03] unto you and you shall return every man
[9:06] unto his possession
[9:08] and ye shall return every man unto his
[9:10] family now it'll finish on down through
[9:12] the other but
[9:13] you may be seated the lord had his
[9:14] blessing to the reading of the word now
[9:17] you may
[9:18] uh in your studies or thoughts run
[9:21] across the idea
[9:22] because the word there is spell jubal
[9:27] we put it jubilee and
[9:30] it can be either one because it's the
[9:31] same meaning
[9:33] just word that you'll think on these
[9:35] things all right
[9:37] now to me
[9:40] i look at a lot of things on a large
[9:44] scale i guess you'd call it
[9:46] to worry that i try to look at the
[9:50] natural
[9:51] and see what's going on and i try to
[9:54] find the spiritual in that
[9:55] because then by watching the bible the
[9:58] prophet's message
[10:00] the things you can tell the day and hour
[10:02] that you're living
[10:04] you know right where you're at the and
[10:06] you don't have to
[10:08] to be concerned with wondering you know
[10:12] you can read the newspaper
[10:14] as we say you know and it literally is
[10:16] the bible
[10:17] because it's telling you what's taking
[10:20] place
[10:21] all right now what is the bible that
[10:24] we've always talked about
[10:26] how is it that i try to express the
[10:28] bible
[10:29] the bible is a firsthand information
[10:33] it is a present tense it deals with the
[10:37] past
[10:39] but yet in future but yet it's present
[10:42] tense
[10:43] right now so that way the prophet said
[10:46] we look back
[10:47] we look forward fail to see where we're
[10:51] at
[10:52] all right now to then recognizing your
[10:55] day
[10:56] in its message see this message that we
[10:59] read
[11:00] in other words to me i can read a
[11:02] message and
[11:03] and turn over in the newspaper now and
[11:06] read what he's talking about
[11:08] right turn your radio on and you'll hear
[11:11] the very thing that you just heard him
[11:13] expressing
[11:14] on a tape or reading in a book you know
[11:17] and it'll be just right there in front
[11:19] of your eyes to where you can see it
[11:22] it's wonderful because it's present
[11:25] tense
[11:27] is no past in god there is no future
[11:31] the future is not here if you get to
[11:34] tomorrow
[11:35] then tomorrow becomes today so there's
[11:39] no
[11:40] future there's no price we take it as we
[11:42] can
[11:43] follow it throughout our our journey
[11:46] in time and read in the newspaper all
[11:49] right
[11:49] like you remember not too long ago that
[11:53] there was some airplanes flew into some
[11:55] towers and they fell
[11:58] and the bible says that when the towers
[12:01] fall
[12:03] isaiah 30. when the towers fall
[12:07] the sun will be is you know the the moon
[12:10] will be as bright as the sun
[12:12] and the sun will be seven fold which
[12:14] means it's the word
[12:16] coming forth in the day and hour that
[12:19] we're living
[12:20] because it's open that up see that where
[12:22] it'll be
[12:23] showing god in what he's doing and they
[12:26] just flew into those towers and you say
[12:28] well that's that's that's not
[12:30] necessarily what that is well
[12:33] what do you want to make it i mean you
[12:36] think it was an accident that they flew
[12:38] into the towers
[12:39] no it was a pre-planned masterpiece
[12:43] that they were capable of bringing those
[12:45] things to pipes
[12:47] but to me i look at it like well hey
[12:49] that's showing the day that we're living
[12:51] because it says when that happens
[12:55] that the the light of the sun you know
[12:58] the light of this
[12:59] the moon will be as bright as the sun
[13:01] well that's church that's
[13:03] looking at where we're at and what we're
[13:05] doing all right and see looking at those
[13:07] things
[13:08] then you can go over and see we had
[13:09] another little incident happen
[13:12] that back in the times of
[13:15] the watergate you remember that
[13:18] all right and watergate you go back in
[13:21] nehemiah
[13:22] and you think and read about i believe
[13:24] it's nehemiah 8
[13:27] that they stood before the watergate and
[13:31] read the word
[13:33] they stood for i forgot how many was 11
[13:35] hours or something
[13:36] a mass great amount of hours that the
[13:39] children of israel
[13:40] stood before the watergate
[13:43] all right and heard the word red well in
[13:46] it odd that this message
[13:48] came at the time of the watergate
[13:51] situation that took place
[13:54] see we should look at things i'm trying
[13:56] to get you to think
[13:58] about looking at things happen that
[14:01] shows it personal
[14:03] to us all right happening in our day
[14:09] that we can read about and know about
[14:11] and understand
[14:13] and see those things coming into being
[14:16] all right so dates and times and seasons
[14:20] you know the bible says stay away from
[14:23] him because he's
[14:24] scared of him but the same god that told
[14:27] us to do that is the god that put it in
[14:29] the word about it
[14:30] so he's not telling us to leave it alone
[14:32] like that
[14:34] it's not it's where to put and and
[14:36] brother dale has been accused of a lot
[14:38] of things
[14:39] but i have never tried to make any
[14:41] prediction
[14:42] of a date of any kind all right
[14:46] now if i can read what brother branham
[14:48] said
[14:51] now who's making the prediction
[14:56] well you're just reading what you want
[14:57] to read well i'll be glad to let you
[14:59] read to me
[15:00] you know whatever you think about of
[15:02] things but see there's things in the
[15:04] bible that
[15:06] that we look at and as we look at it if
[15:10] we take it
[15:11] we could see the very time we're living
[15:14] all right you remember now in matthew
[15:18] about the 20th verse 20th chapter
[15:22] in matthew that an instant took place
[15:28] it speaks of 11th hour worker
[15:32] right all right then it drops down
[15:36] telling about that
[15:37] thou worker that the 11th hour worker
[15:39] gets the same pay
[15:42] all right now so we are the people
[15:45] ending up all things so shouldn't it be
[15:48] said that we're the leaveth our people
[15:51] all right if you don't believe that if
[15:52] they'll pull up number two we'll read it
[15:55] you know we'll pull that up on the
[15:59] screen we'll read number two and see
[16:00] what brother random says
[16:02] about the 11th hour all right
[16:06] taken from that's matthew 20
[16:11] we're quoting from the seal of god in
[16:14] 1954.
[16:16] he's talking about 11th our people could
[16:18] come in the last calling of the gentiles
[16:22] mother worked our dad and them worked
[16:24] their grandmother worked back there
[16:27] this is our age the 11th
[16:30] hour that the world war
[16:33] stopped on the 11th month
[16:38] the 11th day of the month the 11th hour
[16:41] in the day the 11th minute
[16:44] in the hour that the 11th hour
[16:47] people might come in
[16:51] said what received the same baptism in
[16:55] the holy ghost they did back at the
[16:56] beginning
[16:57] all right world war one ended
[17:00] 11th hour 11th minute nobody knows
[17:04] who stopped what nobody knows what
[17:06] caused it
[17:07] to take place but we were the love with
[17:11] our people that was there
[17:13] so it had a vast meaning to us
[17:16] right you'll hear brother branham say a
[17:19] lot of things like moon turn into blood
[17:21] etc
[17:22] and he'll say i can show you maybe he
[17:25] doesn't do it but he said i can show you
[17:27] where that
[17:27] had a drastic meaning or took place
[17:32] right amen because he would would tell
[17:35] you
[17:36] what the bible is talking about we can
[17:40] take his word for it
[17:42] all right so then we're the leaveth our
[17:44] people we're the people to end up all
[17:46] things
[17:47] and it ended right turn 11 11 11 11
[17:51] everything you know and i'm so
[17:54] um mindful of dates and times and
[17:58] seasons i guess
[18:00] till when i turn over in the night my
[18:02] clock's right there
[18:03] at me and if i'm over this way i turn
[18:05] over that away and i look at it and it
[18:07] says 11
[18:08] 11. i say hey that's me
[18:12] you know i think about it don't you
[18:15] i think about like the tower's falling i
[18:18] think that means our day
[18:20] i think that the word came before the
[18:22] watergate situation
[18:24] came into being all right
[18:28] i think those things have something to
[18:30] do with us
[18:31] in each day that we live
[18:34] all right present tense something
[18:37] to be with each one of us
[18:40] all right so now are you following me
[18:44] see maybe we need sometimes to look at
[18:47] dates and times
[18:50] and think about it maybe we can see the
[18:53] day that we're living
[18:55] if we'll do that all right see those
[18:58] things has a bearing
[19:00] upon our lives
[19:04] okay we're all associated with this way
[19:06] or that way
[19:07] one or the other all right now are you
[19:10] you're following what i'm getting
[19:12] so a lot of you know where i'm headed
[19:14] anyway so that's all right but we'll
[19:16] we'll get there in a minute now
[19:21] we read the scripture there in matthew
[19:24] and jesus said this generation
[19:27] shall not pass away till all of these
[19:30] things be fulfilled
[19:32] all right now mankind has taught that
[19:36] as being different things
[19:40] uh a lot of the people took it as
[19:44] uh brother brown says it that they
[19:47] misunderstood and they took it as to be
[19:49] saying
[19:50] you know this generation shall not pass
[19:51] away because a generation is 40 years
[19:54] and that they were saying that when
[19:56] titus came into jerusalem
[19:58] in a.d 70 that that was the 40-year
[20:01] generation
[20:02] and that fulfilled that scripture
[20:03] brother brown says no
[20:07] he says no it doesn't all right now
[20:09] watch what we're getting to
[20:11] let's see if we can pick that one up go
[20:13] on with number number five
[20:15] go number four excuse me
[20:19] i'm laying this the thought down to you
[20:21] and then we'll get to our mind thought
[20:23] okay sir as we would see jesus watch
[20:26] what he says
[20:29] jesus said to him there in matthew when
[20:31] you see the fig tree and all the other
[20:33] trees
[20:35] putting forth buds the time is nigh even
[20:38] at the door
[20:39] see israel put forth their trees but
[20:42] what's the other one
[20:43] brought around and explained it that it
[20:45] was the denominations
[20:47] putting forth their bud right
[20:51] israel is the fig tree the denominations
[20:55] is the one putting forth theirs so we
[20:57] see you know let's see it maybe in this
[20:59] one yes and this one
[21:01] when you see the fig tree and all the
[21:02] other trees putting forth butts
[21:04] know the time is now even at the door
[21:07] this generation shall not pass until all
[21:09] be fulfilled
[21:10] just think of it not only was the jews
[21:12] the fig tree to put forth its buds
[21:15] but the other trees now watch him and
[21:18] every church
[21:18] has had a revival and have been for the
[21:22] last few years
[21:23] the pentecostals you've had a revival
[21:26] the baptist has had a revival
[21:28] the presbyterians had got a revival and
[21:31] the jews are returning to palestine
[21:34] this generation shall not pie shall not
[21:36] cease
[21:37] until all be fulfilled a generation in
[21:39] the bible is 40 years
[21:41] enter 12 years and it's already pisces
[21:43] he's talking about
[21:44] may the 6th we'll come back to that in a
[21:46] minute all right
[21:48] but now think about it see this
[21:51] generation shall not pass away
[21:55] i've said a lot here lately about things
[21:58] and a lot of you would say well where'd
[21:59] he get it will i i just invite you to go
[22:01] find out
[22:04] see when we're in the baptist church
[22:08] and the baptist people taught
[22:13] that the year was to end or some great
[22:15] catastrophe
[22:16] was to take place by the year
[22:21] 1988.
[22:26] because they believe that
[22:30] okay and the reason they believe that
[22:33] israel was established as a nation
[22:37] and they believed it see they picked up
[22:38] a little from thinking it was back there
[22:40] with titus
[22:42] 40 years they picked it up and brought
[22:45] it a little higher to understanding
[22:47] that 1948 the reason they used 48
[22:51] there is a technical argument over the
[22:54] basis
[22:54] of whether israel was established in
[22:58] 46 or 48. some of them say the paperwork
[23:02] was put in
[23:03] all right but the establishment was not
[23:06] to two years later
[23:07] i have no problems with that i listen to
[23:10] the prophet
[23:11] i let him tell me what took place and
[23:14] then i don't have to worry about it
[23:16] all right so now
[23:20] you see that it's very important to
[23:22] follow a
[23:23] a point okay
[23:26] it shall not pass away
[23:31] how the infidel without the
[23:34] interpretation likes to lay on to that
[23:37] see he said this generation not the
[23:40] generation
[23:41] he was talking to the generation that
[23:44] seen the fig tree
[23:45] putting forth his bud see they take that
[23:48] the generation he was talking to
[23:50] would not pisce and that would be titus
[23:52] in a.d 70.
[23:53] all right but he wouldn't talk about
[23:55] that he's talking about when
[23:56] when the people see israel established
[23:58] as a nation
[24:00] all right now when was israel
[24:02] established as a nation
[24:05] he said well what's that got to do with
[24:07] us it's got enough to do with us
[24:11] until brother branham explains it
[24:15] that israel become a nation in on may
[24:18] the 6th
[24:20] in 46
[24:24] and the angel met him on may the 7th
[24:30] to take the message to the world
[24:34] now that's how much he thought about it
[24:36] that's how much he could explain
[24:37] so we're not arguing whether it's this
[24:40] or 48 or whatever
[24:42] we just i've just made the statements
[24:44] but i want you to
[24:45] see this see we're at the end
[24:49] okay the very night
[24:53] taken from number six if you want to
[24:55] read it questions and answers on genesis
[24:58] the very night the very day
[25:02] that the angel of the lord met me 1946
[25:06] on may the 7th at green's mill indiana
[25:10] that same day the treaty which was
[25:11] really may the 6th
[25:14] for israel may the 7th it comes over
[25:17] we'll get to that in a minute and when
[25:19] it did it was
[25:20] established israel as a nation and god
[25:23] goes to the world with a message to the
[25:25] prophet
[25:26] he said well times do mean a little bit
[25:28] don't they
[25:30] if we understand what they are
[25:33] but if we just try to make them our own
[25:35] thoughts we wind up in different things
[25:37] go ahead with number seven
[25:39] the greatest gift in the bible
[25:43] returning to the homeland and said he
[25:44] could die in the homeland be buried
[25:46] you know in other words they said that's
[25:49] what he was saying they said no
[25:50] we come to see the messiah don't
[25:54] run over that too lightly
[26:01] they come to see the messiah
[26:06] watch that when we get down if we fly
[26:08] out time to the end of the message part
[26:12] don't run over that lightly they come to
[26:15] see the messiah
[26:17] that's what they were coming for
[26:20] they were coming back to the homeland to
[26:22] see the messiah because that's what they
[26:24] believed
[26:25] all right and he said don't run over
[26:26] that lightly because one because it'll
[26:28] have a meaning
[26:30] remember the jewish people were declared
[26:31] a nation in 1946
[26:34] on april and he says may the 6th
[26:37] of 1946 and the angel of the lord
[26:39] appeared to me on
[26:41] why he keeps saying april i don't know
[26:42] but said on may the 7th
[26:44] 1946 now the oldest flag is flying and
[26:47] things like that
[26:48] through israel all right now is that
[26:51] enough
[26:52] they've got it on the internet where
[26:54] they can uh well let's
[26:56] let's go on fix and say they had enough
[27:00] on there
[27:01] that we should have enough go to number
[27:02] nine let's pick that thought up
[27:06] it's from the lady of sin church age he
[27:09] said the lady you'll see in church age
[27:10] started in 1906.
[27:13] i predict now remember predict
[27:15] especially you listen at the tape
[27:17] i don't say it will be but predict that
[27:21] it will end by 77
[27:23] that the church will go completely into
[27:26] apostasy
[27:27] and be ousted out of the mouth of god
[27:30] and the second coming
[27:31] or the rapture of the church might come
[27:33] anytime
[27:35] you say well and i've heard hours
[27:39] in the old days in the late 60s that a
[27:42] prediction was a thus
[27:43] saith the lord well now he says the lord
[27:46] didn't tell him
[27:47] we're going to read that in a minute
[27:51] he predicted things would happen
[27:54] there is no statement i invite you to
[27:57] bring it to me
[27:58] there is no statement of 77 that i can
[28:01] find
[28:02] that has any relation without saying a
[28:04] prediction
[28:07] you know or not the lord that i predict
[28:12] see people preaching this thus saith the
[28:14] lord no brother brown said
[28:17] it's a prediction we'll get back to that
[28:18] in a minute but this is the point i want
[28:20] you to look at
[28:23] now i could miss that a year and he just
[28:26] said 77.
[28:29] i could miss that a year i could miss it
[28:33] 20 years
[28:35] i could miss it a hundred years
[28:38] why because he's predicting
[28:43] now i'm serious as can be about it i
[28:45] believed he believed the lord was coming
[28:47] by 77.
[28:48] i do yes come we did
[28:51] you did
[28:55] all right but look
[28:59] now i could miss that a year could miss
[29:00] that 20 years i could miss it 100 years
[29:02] i don't know where but i just predict
[29:04] that according to a vision he showed me
[29:07] and taking the time the way that it's
[29:09] progressing
[29:10] i say it'll be something sometime
[29:12] between 33 and 77.
[29:15] at least this great nation is going to
[29:17] strike a war that's going to blow it to
[29:19] bits and things
[29:20] i believe he was looking for that
[29:23] i do i believe he was looking for it to
[29:26] be over with
[29:27] by 77 yeah
[29:30] because we were and i said
[29:34] the baptist said it'd be over with by
[29:38] 88.
[29:41] a great thing would happen a great thing
[29:45] did happen because in 46 when israel was
[29:49] established as a nation
[29:50] that day they were established as a
[29:52] nation the next
[29:54] day the prophet struck the gentile
[29:56] dispensation
[29:57] to bring the word right
[30:00] great thing did happen so it had a
[30:03] meaning to it
[30:05] i won't go on into some of what
[30:08] about this that i could cover but
[30:10] there's one thing about it
[30:12] we better click pay close attention
[30:14] because whether you like it or not we're
[30:16] running out of time
[30:19] an endeavor priest nowhere
[30:23] any date or any thought or any time
[30:26] that the lord was coming if you can find
[30:28] it bring it to me
[30:31] but i have read what your prophet said
[30:37] see he believed in those things
[30:39] something great did happen
[30:41] in 46 right
[30:45] right just as something great did happen
[30:49] in 1911. the 11th hour level
[30:53] something happened that was in writing
[30:56] it we could read it in our
[30:58] or you know we could turn over in the
[30:59] newspaper and see
[31:01] the war ended 11 11 11.
[31:08] see we didn't pay attention to it that
[31:10] god was giving us some dates and times
[31:15] then when it strikes 46
[31:20] he's given us more dates and times
[31:23] he's given us a time that israel was
[31:26] established as a nation
[31:32] he's given us a time when the message
[31:34] struck the world
[31:37] so we can take dates and times and
[31:39] seasons
[31:40] you know if we'll let him say it
[31:45] not us now see because we put our own
[31:47] interpretation in there
[31:49] and you know what i'm saying you that
[31:52] was in the message back there you know
[31:54] what
[31:54] in the in the late of the 60s
[31:57] and the early 70s and all of these
[32:00] things
[32:01] you know what was taught
[32:06] i asked a man one time i said what if it
[32:08] pisces 77
[32:10] he said i'll get out of the message and
[32:13] he turned his thought went back and that
[32:15] was all right cause his point
[32:16] he said no i'd say we misunderstood
[32:18] brother branham
[32:22] brother branham never said what he said
[32:25] about 77
[32:26] everybody says that he says the lord's
[32:28] coming all this out and the other
[32:30] end of the world he said them things
[32:33] but all of them was a prediction
[32:39] and they see it leaves it then to where
[32:42] that we take what he says
[32:44] and then after a while maybe it'll
[32:46] unfold
[32:48] a closer point
[32:52] that he goes into the bible then and
[32:55] says things
[32:57] all right now if i can say them things
[32:59] i'm not making a prediction
[33:01] if i can say what he said is that making
[33:03] a prediction no
[33:04] that's making his prediction because
[33:07] that's what he said he said it was a
[33:09] prediction
[33:10] all right all of those things happen so
[33:13] he said i could miss it
[33:16] because he's predicting
[33:19] so when somebody comes along and says
[33:21] brought around and said the lord's
[33:22] coming in 77 you say no
[33:25] he didn't say that well i got this quote
[33:28] we'll read all the quotes
[33:32] now here he says he could miss it a year
[33:34] 20 years
[33:35] or 100 years that's right
[33:39] because it's a prediction
[33:42] now if he had thus saith the lord he
[33:44] would have told us
[33:46] right and you know what it would have
[33:47] been
[33:49] but he didn't he gave a prediction for
[33:52] the things
[33:53] all right let's go on just get read
[33:55] these predictions get it out of the way
[34:00] bird the one we just in the lady ocean i
[34:03] could miss it a year i could miss it 20
[34:05] years
[34:06] i could miss it 100 years i don't know
[34:10] but i just predict that according to a
[34:13] vision he showed me
[34:15] at least this great nation is going to
[34:18] strike
[34:19] a war that's going to blow it to bits
[34:22] all right i believe he believed that
[34:26] and i keep saying it you know why i
[34:29] believe he believed that
[34:31] because we believed that
[34:36] now you tell me so brother dale i didn't
[34:37] believe it'd be 77
[34:41] i'm going to say i don't agree with you
[34:43] because i believe you did
[34:46] now even though and i'll prove it in a
[34:48] minute even though i stood in 74
[34:52] and preached that we could pass the year
[34:55] 2026
[34:57] and not break the bible and our brother
[34:59] branham's message
[35:00] i still didn't think it's going to go
[35:02] that long
[35:04] i didn't want it to go that long and i
[35:06] didn't think it was going but i just
[35:08] read what the prophet said
[35:12] right because i took what he said if we
[35:16] can read what he said
[35:18] then we're a whole lot closer than all
[35:20] of our predictions
[35:22] but you know what i'm talking about you
[35:25] know how it was in the 70s
[35:28] you know how i told a dream
[35:32] anna was born what 74 where she
[35:35] three 73. i told a dream
[35:39] in about 70 or 71
[35:42] that i dreamed that had a little girl
[35:45] just about this tall
[35:48] and that brother moat had a little boy
[35:51] about that size
[35:54] you know i told the dream you know what
[35:56] everybody life you're going to miss the
[35:57] rapture
[35:58] because it's coming 73
[36:02] i said where you get that from because
[36:04] brother branham said 77 we're under it
[36:07] and we've got to have three and a half
[36:08] years tribulation before we get to 77.
[36:10] so i guess you're gonna miss it well you
[36:12] know why
[36:14] we're still here and you know what
[36:16] there's a little girl sitting over there
[36:18] it's got a little girl a little bit
[36:19] taller than what she was when i've seen
[36:20] it
[36:21] and brother mo little boys forest moat
[36:26] up in lebanon tennessee if you want to
[36:27] go see him the dream came to piss
[36:31] everybody was laughing at me saying well
[36:34] you ain't you're gonna miss it
[36:37] i said okay it's all right with me
[36:41] you know i didn't believe it but it's
[36:43] all right but you say well
[36:46] yeah in 1974 i just read what brother
[36:49] branham said
[36:52] and people didn't like it because they
[36:55] had all of the thus saith the lords
[36:57] whichever one of them was predictions
[37:00] because i want you to show me
[37:01] one time brother random even just made
[37:03] the statement of 77
[37:05] without calling it a prediction
[37:09] or that the lord didn't tell him
[37:14] but see we take it we got it all figured
[37:16] out somebody come along make statements
[37:17] and roll it off and
[37:18] let you read it are we going to believe
[37:21] it
[37:23] okay go ahead number 10.
[37:29] this is called conference
[37:32] then i turned and looked and i seen the
[37:34] united states with a smaller in
[37:35] something that
[37:36] burned it up and down beneath there i
[37:38] said
[37:40] not in the trance but i predict
[37:43] remember this i guess this is tapes
[37:47] too i predict that these things will
[37:49] take place between now
[37:50] and 1977 which gives us 17 years
[37:54] left if my prediction strike a
[37:56] prediction
[37:58] a prediction all right
[38:02] go ahead at number 11.
[38:09] this is from this 70 weeks of daniel
[38:12] and in 1933 we were worshipping over
[38:16] there in the masonic temple
[38:18] where the church of christ stands today
[38:20] all right and i'll pull it on up he was
[38:22] over there
[38:22] striking it and what it was taking place
[38:24] and wrote it down told it
[38:26] because that was the dream or i mean the
[38:27] vision of the seven things that would
[38:29] take place
[38:31] all right that was 1933 and i predict
[38:35] that there would be some great tragedy
[38:37] happen to this united states
[38:39] before or by the year of 1977 how many
[38:43] remembers me saying that
[38:45] a prediction i'm reading these because i
[38:48] don't want you to come along
[38:50] i found another one go find it and bring
[38:52] it to me because this is all that i can
[38:54] find on the computer
[38:55] of 77.
[38:59] because watch this one go ahead and
[39:02] number 12.
[39:04] condemnation by representation really
[39:07] don't know
[39:09] he's talking about the vision
[39:13] right automobiles will continue to get
[39:15] like egg shape
[39:17] finally they'll build one that won't
[39:18] need a steering wheel
[39:20] they got it now it will be controlled by
[39:23] some other power
[39:24] when they first started out on the
[39:26] automobile they were
[39:27] trying to control it by one now they've
[39:29] got it so perfected
[39:31] until you just get in the car and you
[39:32] don't have to do nothing
[39:35] and they had to put the wire in the
[39:37] ground on the first ones
[39:40] they started coming across the country
[39:42] doing that right
[39:44] they start doing they don't have to put
[39:45] nothing now it's all guided by satellite
[39:48] you get in your car and go to california
[39:51] that's right
[39:53] it's here we're reading in the newspaper
[39:57] what's your prophet saying right
[40:00] now look then i've seen the united
[40:02] states there's one smolder and burned
[40:03] over
[40:04] it will be near the end then i got in
[40:06] for instance
[40:07] i predict that this will take place
[40:10] now remember the lord
[40:14] that's what the lord showed what did the
[40:16] lord show seven
[40:17] things that's what the lord showed but i
[40:20] predict this will take place before
[40:24] 1977. upon this prediction i base
[40:28] because of the own rushing
[40:30] slaughter that's coming now in the face
[40:32] of how things is moving
[40:34] where would he be today to look at it
[40:36] and see those things taking place okay
[40:38] so what did he say now the lord the lord
[40:41] showed him the vision
[40:43] but he predicted okay go ahead to the
[40:46] next
[40:48] ephesians parallels or ephesian churches
[40:53] he's talking about the ages and how they
[40:54] come down and uh
[40:56] the last lasted till 1750 the lutheran
[40:59] age then from 1750 the next day it's
[41:01] coming down 1906 ladies and church age
[41:04] and i don't know when it'll end but i
[41:06] predict
[41:07] it'll be done by 1977.
[41:11] i predict not the lord told me
[41:16] [Music]
[41:18] but i predict according to a vision they
[41:21] will show to the years and the things
[41:22] he predicted he believed it he believes
[41:25] it was going to be
[41:27] but he's enough to say the lord didn't
[41:30] tell me now watch this one go ahead to
[41:35] 14
[41:38] which is the lady you see in church age
[41:41] all right
[41:42] as a servant of god who has had
[41:45] multitudes of visions of which none has
[41:47] ever failed
[41:48] let me predict i did not say
[41:51] prophesy
[41:55] but predict
[42:00] right because of the
[42:03] the things that he's seen and now even
[42:06] the lord spoke to him and showed all of
[42:08] those things right they were all to be
[42:09] there come on
[42:11] come on down go to 15.
[42:14] because this is the good one
[42:17] let us see in church age
[42:21] based on these seven visions along with
[42:23] the rapid of change and all
[42:24] i predict i do not prophesy that these
[42:27] visions will have all come to pass by
[42:29] 1977
[42:31] and though many may feel that this is an
[42:34] irresponsible statement in view of the
[42:37] fact that jesus
[42:38] said no man knoweth the day nor the hour
[42:43] i still maintain this prediction after
[42:45] 30 years because
[42:47] jesus did not say no man could know the
[42:51] year
[42:52] month or week in which his coming
[42:55] was to be completed
[43:02] now what's he saying
[43:07] he's saying you could know within a
[43:08] month a week
[43:12] or a year and you wouldn't be knowing
[43:15] today
[43:17] see jesus said no man knows the day so
[43:20] he's saying it
[43:22] you could know it like that all right
[43:26] he didn't seem to have any trouble i
[43:27] repeat sincerely and believe and
[43:29] maintain as a private
[43:31] uh student of the word along with divine
[43:32] inspiration that 1977
[43:35] ought to terminate the world systems and
[43:37] usher in the millennium
[43:40] all right
[43:45] let's see if this one yeah go ahead to
[43:47] the next one see
[43:48] don't read just read 16. yeah okay
[43:51] number 16.
[43:52] don't miss a witches from daniel 7 which
[43:55] is from
[43:56] the 70th week of daniel don't
[43:58] misunderstand now and say brother
[44:00] branham said jesus will come
[44:02] in 1977. i never said no such a thing
[44:06] jesus may come today but i have
[44:09] predicted that between 33 and 77
[44:12] something would take place that these
[44:14] things that i seen come to pass
[44:16] in a vision would take place and five of
[44:19] them has already
[44:20] took place now
[44:26] there's a point of interest to you
[44:34] why would he take 33 to 77
[44:41] why would he use 1977
[44:48] right why do you use it what was the
[44:51] purpose of using
[44:52] 77 something must have taken place
[44:58] in 1977.
[45:04] why would he emphasize 77 why did he end
[45:06] up 64
[45:08] or 63 or the opening of the seals in 65
[45:11] you know or something like that three
[45:13] four five
[45:18] did he use 77
[45:23] he says he didn't know
[45:27] listen what about it
[45:33] what is
[45:37] the great meaning of 77.
[45:44] you know that in the the uh
[45:48] it's not the great planet earth i've got
[45:50] the book laying at home
[45:52] but it was written about the pyramids
[45:54] you know in the pyramids
[45:56] they have the wars to the dates in
[45:59] inches and things
[46:02] one two dates inches and things in the
[46:04] pyramid
[46:06] and the pyramid was built on a uh
[46:09] power squire you know form
[46:13] then it goes we do two one off but it's
[46:15] three point one four
[46:17] it's built up on that
[46:20] and there is in that chamber when you
[46:23] enter the king's chamber
[46:25] there is a wood i mean a a hewn-out bed
[46:29] in the rocks
[46:31] and they asked the man i've got the book
[46:33] at home so it's all don't matter
[46:36] they said what would be the last date
[46:38] you would find in the pyramid
[46:43] he said when it strikes a wall said it
[46:45] says in 1977.
[46:48] some of you studied those things some of
[46:50] you've read some of the
[46:51] pyramidologies and i'm not a pure
[46:53] mediology type of guy
[46:55] no but there were some odd things that
[46:57] was in there
[46:58] how they would how the wars and the
[47:00] things right to the
[47:03] my new inch which is in metrics instead
[47:06] of inches
[47:08] all right see what's 77
[47:16] what's this one's it picked is it a
[47:19] random pick
[47:29] is uh 46
[47:32] a random pick
[47:37] that israel becomes a nation on may the
[47:40] 6th and
[47:41] the word strikes the prophet in the cave
[47:45] and he takes a message to the world on
[47:47] may the 7th
[47:48] is that an accident or a pick of time
[47:56] is the 11th hour worker
[47:59] which represents the 11th hour people
[48:03] is that an accident that it's the 11th
[48:06] hour
[48:07] or is it bible fulfilled
[48:13] i'm just asking you a simple question i
[48:16] love questions
[48:20] you have an answer to the question i'd
[48:22] love to hear it
[48:28] but why would he pick 77
[48:34] okay go ahead and number
[48:38] 17 which is off of the 70th week of
[48:42] daniel
[48:46] he comes along he's talking about the
[48:47] vision five out of three or you know
[48:50] five out of seven
[48:51] has happened and comes around and shows
[48:54] and then i predicted
[48:55] i never said the lord told me that but
[48:58] standing that morning in the church i
[49:01] said the way now listen to what he said
[49:04] i got back on one end of the wall
[49:06] and ran to the other end of the wall and
[49:08] i said
[49:10] by the way progress is going on
[49:13] i'll predict that the time i don't know
[49:16] why
[49:16] i'm saying it
[49:20] but i predict that that'll happen
[49:24] between right now 1933 and 1977
[49:29] and not knowing it
[49:35] now he said he didn't know why he said
[49:37] it now he said in not knowing it
[49:41] he goes to the scriptures
[49:48] come on
[49:51] i never knowed it until yesterday
[49:55] that 1977 is
[49:58] the jubilee
[50:07] and exactly the same amount of time run
[50:09] out did he give with israel and
[50:12] everything at the end which is the same
[50:13] time we get
[50:17] and he says up here what i don't know
[50:20] why
[50:21] i'm saying it and he said
[50:25] i know and not knowing it
[50:29] god shows knows my heart
[50:35] he said 1977 was the jubilee
[50:40] okay i can stop right there without
[50:43] continuing
[50:44] any progress on anything and declare
[50:47] brother random was god's prophet
[50:49] and knew exactly what he's talking about
[50:57] see we're looking at 77 as a date we
[50:59] looked at 46 as a date
[51:02] we looked at uh uh 11th hour
[51:06] as a date
[51:10] we look at things as dates and times and
[51:12] the bible says i'm scared of your
[51:13] experiences that way
[51:15] you don't look at dates and times you
[51:17] look at what happens on the date
[51:21] when the day of pentecost was fully come
[51:25] you know what that meant they wasn't
[51:28] there
[51:29] in december or january or whatever i
[51:32] don't know what the date is there
[51:33] i'm when the day of pentecost was fully
[51:37] come
[51:39] when the holy ghost fell
[51:42] had to be the exact date the exact time
[51:48] right
[51:53] but what about trying to tell people
[51:55] this in 74
[51:57] when everybody was already saying had to
[51:59] be overwhelmed by 77
[52:01] they didn't even know what 77 was
[52:04] well it's just a year no your prophet
[52:07] said
[52:08] it's a jubilee a jubilee means a release
[52:16] that's when this message became more
[52:18] important to me than ever
[52:21] when it struck that 77 because dates and
[52:23] times and seasons was gone
[52:26] everybody had their predictions come on
[52:28] folks you out there on the internet you
[52:30] can smile and grin
[52:31] back off the corner but you know you
[52:33] faced it coming down through there
[52:35] and you taught all kind of dates and
[52:36] times and seasons for the rapture
[52:40] like i've told you many times one one
[52:42] man called me he said
[52:43] 1973 he said what do you think about
[52:45] this rapture of the church coming on
[52:47] good friday
[52:48] you know or the connection to the
[52:49] resurrection maybe he said resurrection
[52:52] i said okay praise the lord
[52:55] he said you don't sound like you believe
[52:59] it
[53:01] well i'm just saying praise the lord you
[53:04] know i
[53:05] i hope it happens he said well they do
[53:08] have it figured out
[53:10] then it can come one year later
[53:14] you know how nasty i am because you
[53:17] ought to know what i said back to it
[53:18] i said now it sounds like you don't
[53:20] believe it
[53:23] he was trying to explain 73 and in his
[53:26] own words he explained it could be a
[53:28] year later because
[53:29] like in the city you know you could have
[53:31] and you were locked in a city
[53:32] you had one year of time to get out they
[53:34] were coming with all that
[53:37] and you know what happened in the 70s
[53:40] people
[53:40] sold everything in the book borrowed
[53:42] every dime of money they could borrow it
[53:45] done every dirty trick in the book
[53:48] christians
[53:50] man told his church that this bar
[53:53] anything you want to borrow
[53:55] you don't have to pay it back anyway
[53:57] that ain't a christian
[54:02] christian pays your debts if you don't
[54:05] pay him you ain't a christian
[54:10] okay now listen
[54:16] not knowing god knows my heart
[54:19] i never noted until yesterday that 1977
[54:25] is the jubilee
[54:29] why don't we think of 77 as a jubilee
[54:32] a release
[54:37] what are you trying to say brother dale
[54:39] 1977
[54:41] has more importance to it than
[54:44] 46 and 48 or 11 for the
[54:47] the war being over or any of those
[54:50] things
[54:51] had more to do with it than all of that
[54:55] it was a vast turn of the biggest
[54:56] portion of people in this mansion
[55:00] they literally sent their books back
[55:02] they sent back they just
[55:04] dropped out of the message why because
[55:07] they said brother branham said rapture's
[55:08] coming 77
[55:11] got to be over with a little girl
[55:15] they told me he said you're gonna miss
[55:18] it because if you got a little girl
[55:20] then you're going to be pissed 77
[55:22] because she's born 73
[55:27] well we're still here
[55:33] you know people went haywire when
[55:35] everything went
[55:36] wrong i'm going to say this part real
[55:39] quick
[55:41] they questioned brother branham
[55:47] whether it was right or not in 77. okay
[55:53] in 86
[55:57] when it didn't happen they questioned
[56:00] the bible
[56:04] because they were going with the
[56:06] generation
[56:09] the year 2000 they questioned science
[56:13] and
[56:14] technologies
[56:17] because you know yourself
[56:20] we had a watch night service and people
[56:23] come and they said what should we do
[56:25] i said okay if you're scared make sure
[56:28] your gas tank's full where you can get
[56:30] home
[56:31] and i said bring you a fly slide because
[56:34] the power was supposed to go off
[56:37] when it struck 2 000.
[56:42] i'm serious
[56:46] i didn't bring flights and i've had one
[56:48] out in the vehicle
[56:50] that's serious i said bring you a flight
[56:53] slot
[56:53] make sure your gas tank's full or you
[56:56] can get back home
[56:58] because you think it's all going to be
[56:59] over do you understand what i'm saying
[57:02] they questioned the prophet 77
[57:05] they questioned the bible when it got to
[57:09] 46 or either 48
[57:10] and it didn't come to piss now mankind
[57:13] is questioning everything
[57:14] they have nothing like brother russ and
[57:16] i were talking about people have just
[57:18] gone to the bases now what
[57:20] there's no advancement there's no trying
[57:23] to move on there's nothing in the world
[57:25] while it's trying to do it it's just all
[57:27] folding inward
[57:29] like he was saying i never thought of
[57:31] like that america found out they could
[57:34] print money they printed money
[57:37] china found out they wasn't doing it
[57:39] they found out they can print money we
[57:41] print money
[57:42] all the countries started printing money
[57:44] why because they figured they ain't got
[57:46] to pay it
[57:51] you understand what i'm getting
[57:54] could we be questioning all the things
[57:58] that would be any hope for us
[58:03] over a date
[58:07] when i say and always have
[58:10] taught it in 74 still teach it today but
[58:12] around him know exactly what he's
[58:14] talking about
[58:15] to the very day he knew what he's
[58:18] talking about
[58:21] he said well nobody knows today and i i
[58:22] ain't talking about 24 hours a day i'm
[58:24] talking about a time
[58:25] element now let's see if we can prove
[58:28] that
[58:30] that he knew a time element
[58:35] well now you already understand what i'm
[58:37] saying what is the 77
[58:39] it's a jubilee
[58:42] that's what he's saying he didn't say it
[58:45] was this or that or the other order
[58:47] he said it was a jubilee what's a
[58:49] jubilee
[58:51] it's a release
[58:56] the people had an opportunity in 1977 to
[58:58] be released
[59:00] but instead they run back and said
[59:02] brother branham missed it
[59:04] he's it they got bored in the ear they
[59:06] didn't have to go to the baptists in
[59:07] methodist
[59:08] get bored in the ear they went back to
[59:10] their own terminologies
[59:12] and got bored in the air where are they
[59:13] today it took 40 years
[59:16] but then they started blowing away like
[59:18] they're doing now
[59:20] the preachers preach 40 years now
[59:22] they're trying their best to prove
[59:24] brother branham was wrong
[59:29] i don't challenge nobody but i'll tell
[59:31] you that that's this is internet
[59:33] if you think i'm wrong on what i'm
[59:35] fixing to say come let's talk about it
[59:38] i'll meet you come let's talk about it
[59:43] because i'm going to just tell you what
[59:44] brother branham said about 77
[59:47] and then you can do what you want to
[59:49] because this is what i've done in 74.
[59:51] and i never predicted no dates or times
[59:54] or seasons
[59:55] i just simply took calculations of what
[59:58] he said
[59:59] okay let's start okay number 18.
[1:00:04] now remember we're looking for a jubilee
[1:00:07] we're looking to find out what a jubilee
[1:00:12] is
[1:00:14] you're going to find out the bible's got
[1:00:15] a lot to say about it amen
[1:00:17] all right from the 70th week of daniel
[1:00:20] paragraph 195
[1:00:21] he's coming down and showing that usher
[1:00:24] says the same amount of time
[1:00:26] you know it goes into galatians and the
[1:00:28] salvational part
[1:00:30] and he closes to the chronology of the
[1:00:32] hebrews
[1:00:33] the power of god was with the jews
[1:00:35] exactly
[1:00:37] 1954 years
[1:00:40] god dealt with the jews 1954 years
[1:00:44] according to the chronology of the jews
[1:00:47] and according to galatians 3 16
[1:00:50] and 17 which you read that and you can't
[1:00:52] figure out how he's doing he's talking
[1:00:54] about salvation to the gentiles
[1:01:00] that's galatians read it god dealt with
[1:01:03] the jews 1954 years
[1:01:06] okay now counting the time we find that
[1:01:09] we have exactly listen
[1:01:11] 17 years left and we will have the same
[1:01:14] span of time
[1:01:15] given to us as god dealing with us
[1:01:18] and the power of the holy spirit since
[1:01:20] 1933
[1:01:22] until 1977.
[1:01:26] 1833 until 1977.
[1:01:29] the same span of time 1954 years
[1:01:33] you're gonna say in a minute you crossed
[1:01:35] yourself no i didn't i just read what he
[1:01:38] said
[1:01:38] you're crossing what he's saying listen
[1:01:45] god deals at the same time he did with
[1:01:47] the jews
[1:01:48] now mark down in your book a little
[1:01:51] scripture
[1:01:52] here i want to give you
[1:01:55] leviticus 25
[1:01:59] begin with the eighth verse
[1:02:07] god calls the jubilee every 49th
[1:02:11] year
[1:02:15] the 50th year was the jubilee
[1:02:19] we know that we understand that
[1:02:22] from the first jubilee of leviticus 25
[1:02:26] 8 in 1977
[1:02:32] will be the 70th jubilee
[1:02:40] now do you believe he's right making
[1:02:43] exactly 3 430 years
[1:02:49] jubilee means to going up the release
[1:02:56] making exactly 3 430 years
[1:03:01] give me a mathematical mathematical
[1:03:03] calculation
[1:03:04] of a 50 being a jubilee and bring it out
[1:03:07] to 3430.
[1:03:13] come on some of your mathematicians give
[1:03:15] them a mathematical calculation
[1:03:18] of using 50.
[1:03:23] well you know what you're going to wind
[1:03:24] up with you're going to wind up short
[1:03:29] because if you say 50 times 50 times 70
[1:03:33] that's 3 500.
[1:03:36] you're missing it
[1:03:40] what does this all mean to me i just
[1:03:42] need salvation
[1:03:44] there is no salvation outside the word
[1:03:46] of god
[1:03:48] you are the one that's been arguing with
[1:03:49] the prophet not me
[1:03:51] you are the one that's been doubting the
[1:03:53] word of the prophet
[1:03:55] and i ain't smiling i'm saying you've
[1:03:57] been doubting because you've been trying
[1:03:59] to figure it out
[1:03:59] and you can't get it figured out and it
[1:04:01] never will be figured out by the human
[1:04:03] mind
[1:04:09] let's re-read
[1:04:12] leviticus 25 begin with the eighth verse
[1:04:18] i don't mind making this statement if
[1:04:21] brother random would have said leviticus
[1:04:22] 25
[1:04:23] 10 the rapture would have come in 77
[1:04:28] or he would have been a false prophet
[1:04:33] he didn't go to 10 he went to 25
[1:04:36] 8.
[1:04:39] we're going to read 25 8 but we got to
[1:04:41] get this right okay
[1:04:43] beginning with the eighth verse god
[1:04:44] calls it jubilee every 49th year
[1:04:46] the 50th year was the jubilee okay we
[1:04:49] know that
[1:04:50] there's a 49. we're going to have to go
[1:04:52] through this in a minute
[1:04:53] there's a jubilee every seven years in
[1:04:56] the bible
[1:04:58] every seven years as a jubilee
[1:05:02] all right i'm giving you the words of
[1:05:04] the prophet and the bible
[1:05:07] all right see that's where we miss it at
[1:05:10] we think we've got it all figured out it
[1:05:12] won't work because look
[1:05:14] from the first jubilee
[1:05:18] from the first jubilee of leviticus 25
[1:05:21] 8.
[1:05:26] in 1977 will be the 70th jubilee making
[1:05:29] exactly 3 430 years
[1:05:32] the jubilee means to going up the
[1:05:34] release
[1:05:39] as i said you can't use a 50 because
[1:05:42] he's dealing with a 49.
[1:05:47] he just said as a jubilee ever
[1:05:52] calls the jubilee every 49th year amen
[1:05:55] brother random was not the messenger of
[1:05:58] lady osea
[1:05:59] you're going to argue that anyway so you
[1:06:01] might as well go ahead
[1:06:03] he was the messenger to stand between
[1:06:05] lady osea and eternity
[1:06:07] because the messenger always comes to
[1:06:08] the end of the age
[1:06:11] that's exactly right you know i've
[1:06:13] taught that for 40 years
[1:06:16] all right how did he get 34-30
[1:06:27] how did he know the 77 was a jubilee
[1:06:33] we thought it was a year or a date he
[1:06:36] said it was a jubilee
[1:06:40] now mathematically do me something
[1:06:45] 49th year
[1:06:49] the 50th was the jubilee we know that
[1:06:51] but wade proved out here a while back
[1:06:54] that israel never
[1:06:58] did celebrate the 50.
[1:07:06] they have never celebrated the 50th why
[1:07:09] they don't know they know one thing he's
[1:07:12] supposed to let everything go free and
[1:07:13] they ain't going to do that
[1:07:15] they're jews okay now
[1:07:20] we think a jubilee is a 50.
[1:07:23] we'll do 49 times 50.
[1:07:31] no right
[1:07:35] so you go until you're 50.
[1:07:39] but watch him
[1:07:43] that's 2 450 years mathematically you're
[1:07:46] off
[1:07:47] 50 ton 49 you're off
[1:07:51] you got to have another number then all
[1:07:54] right
[1:07:54] so raise it up take your thing off and
[1:07:57] we'll
[1:07:58] we'll keep that to where we can use it
[1:08:00] okay
[1:08:02] come on up did you get that
[1:08:06] god has dealt it with us exactly the
[1:08:08] same amount of time that he dealt with
[1:08:09] israel
[1:08:10] from the time he gave give abraham the
[1:08:13] promise
[1:08:13] until the rejecting of the messiah in
[1:08:16] a.d 33
[1:08:17] with 1954 years and then we have 17
[1:08:20] years left
[1:08:20] we've had 1930-something years we've got
[1:08:23] 17 years left until
[1:08:25] 77 will be the 70th
[1:08:29] jubilee since the beginning of jubilees
[1:08:38] read it now multiply 70 times 49.
[1:08:44] get it back up here and multiply form
[1:08:46] okay 70 times 49
[1:08:48] equals 3 430 years
[1:08:53] brother branham know the exact years in
[1:08:55] the time
[1:09:00] 1977 is the 70th jubilee since the
[1:09:02] beginning of jubilees
[1:09:04] from according to leviticus 25 8
[1:09:08] making exactly 3 430 years
[1:09:14] but the random was right it was just us
[1:09:16] trying to figure it out
[1:09:21] see we tried to mathematically and you
[1:09:23] can't do it mathematically
[1:09:28] he done it mathematically because we
[1:09:30] don't know what to multiply
[1:09:32] we get in a jubilee and we want to use
[1:09:34] 50. but there was a jubilee
[1:09:36] every 49th a messenger
[1:09:39] come in that 49th
[1:09:42] now if i don't get time to bring it
[1:09:45] listen
[1:09:47] 49 represents the seven church ages
[1:09:50] that's right amen
[1:09:54] seven sevens is 49. you got seven church
[1:09:57] ages
[1:10:01] right each church age gets a release
[1:10:11] i hadn't left what it's telling you
[1:10:14] i'm just trying to stare away from where
[1:10:15] wade's at to where i can move over a
[1:10:17] little bit over here
[1:10:19] well that's an odd way of saying it but
[1:10:21] that's what i'm doing
[1:10:26] 49 is the seven church ages you need
[1:10:29] that from the prophet
[1:10:32] there was a jubilee in the bible
[1:10:35] every seven years
[1:10:42] no no no they just jubilee on the 50.
[1:10:45] see you're not in the line i ain't got
[1:10:49] time
[1:10:50] so i'm gonna push christ okay
[1:10:53] finish it this afternoon
[1:10:57] so what do we got
[1:11:00] according to leviticus 25 8
[1:11:05] and the sabbath of the land shall be
[1:11:06] made
[1:11:08] unto you coming down from verse six
[1:11:12] and the cattle and the thing thou shalt
[1:11:14] number seven
[1:11:15] sabbaths of years unto thee
[1:11:18] all right
[1:11:21] and what will it be seven
[1:11:25] times seven years and the space of the
[1:11:27] seven
[1:11:28] sabbaths of years shall be unto thee
[1:11:30] forty and nine
[1:11:32] years
[1:11:36] there was never a change of the body in
[1:11:39] the church ages
[1:11:44] are we right no change of the body in
[1:11:46] the seven church ages
[1:11:48] you got to get outside the ages to have
[1:11:50] you change of the body
[1:11:53] you see you're dealing with 49. 49 times
[1:11:56] 70 is 3 430 exactly what he's saying
[1:12:03] well brother what i can't understand is
[1:12:05] called i know what brother branham said
[1:12:06] over there
[1:12:07] said it said in the 70s jubilee since it
[1:12:09] began it said what will it be said be
[1:12:11] going up for the gentile bride
[1:12:12] and the return of christ to the jews
[1:12:14] when they go out of bondage and we don't
[1:12:16] pass that a long ways
[1:12:17] so you missed it did it
[1:12:21] you're looking at the wrong thing i'm
[1:12:24] looking at where we started at and what
[1:12:25] he said
[1:12:30] that it's a jubilee
[1:12:35] a release
[1:12:38] a release a jubilee
[1:12:43] this message is what to bring us
[1:12:46] the ability to go free you agree with
[1:12:48] that
[1:12:50] there comes a seventh church aged
[1:12:52] messenger
[1:12:53] which was the holy ghost himself your
[1:12:55] prophet said it
[1:12:56] no messenger of the age because the holy
[1:12:58] ghost came himself said by the end of
[1:13:00] the age
[1:13:00] the messenger come brother brown steps
[1:13:02] over to end of the age
[1:13:04] starts his message and he comes forth
[1:13:07] proclaiming liberty
[1:13:10] when he come over to this he's seen what
[1:13:12] that was he was a jubilee
[1:13:16] do you realize what he's saying
[1:13:21] yeah but but he said it's a it's a
[1:13:23] return of christ to the jews when they
[1:13:24] go out of bondage
[1:13:27] this message is the release it's going
[1:13:30] to take us in the rapture
[1:13:32] will you agree the jews
[1:13:36] it doesn't mean a date so you're
[1:13:38] thinking that it said 1977
[1:13:40] would have been the jews being released
[1:13:42] that's gone in the rapture
[1:13:44] that wasn't what he taught he taught 77
[1:13:47] was a jubilee
[1:13:54] see we can go i know ain't got time to
[1:13:58] finish but listen
[1:14:02] if it's 3 430 years
[1:14:06] and he's got that right and if we
[1:14:08] believe it
[1:14:09] in 1977 it's the 70th jubilee
[1:14:13] then you realize
[1:14:20] you can add either one you want to
[1:14:24] but add 49 more years
[1:14:29] to 1954.
[1:14:32] excuse me 1977.
[1:14:35] can you add that up
[1:14:39] can you put that up take 1977
[1:14:43] and had 49 more years
[1:14:48] because that'd be another jubilee
[1:14:53] i don't think you got me so just hold on
[1:14:55] where you're at
[1:14:57] that comes out to 1926.
[1:15:01] i mean 20 20 26.
[1:15:07] this is what i taught then and what i
[1:15:08] still teach today
[1:15:10] according to the prophet's message he
[1:15:12] never taught anything on dates and times
[1:15:14] we misunderstood him we didn't see what
[1:15:17] he was talking about
[1:15:18] it was a jubilee he was talking about
[1:15:20] not a year or time
[1:15:22] and we tried to figure it out we'd be
[1:15:23] here we'd be there
[1:15:25] i proved then by the prophet that we
[1:15:27] could go to the year 2026
[1:15:31] by adding 49 years to 3430.
[1:15:34] if you want to add 50 you're going to go
[1:15:35] one more year
[1:15:37] either way you want to add it
[1:15:42] and this is what i say it i said we can
[1:15:44] pass the year 2026
[1:15:47] and not break the prophet's message we
[1:15:49] still have the tapes of that
[1:15:53] where i taught him see i never taught
[1:15:56] anything about dates and times
[1:15:57] i read what he said 1977 be the 70s
[1:16:01] jubilee since the beginning of the
[1:16:02] jubilees
[1:16:03] from according to leviticus 25 8 making
[1:16:06] exactly 3 430 years
[1:16:11] something happened in 1977 we entered a
[1:16:14] jubilee
[1:16:16] i like to say we entered eternity
[1:16:20] that's a little hard for people to
[1:16:21] comprehend when you're getting older
[1:16:27] but if you'll take it that we entered
[1:16:30] the present
[1:16:31] tense form of the gospel
[1:16:36] you'll take it that we entered into
[1:16:39] present tense i
[1:16:40] am means ever present for eternity
[1:16:48] that's why i've been happy since then
[1:16:50] that's why i've told you
[1:16:52] everybody says revival's over
[1:16:56] it was a revival in 1977 when god showed
[1:17:00] me that
[1:17:02] and i came here and preached it and i
[1:17:04] said we'd go to the year 2026
[1:17:07] and not break the bible or the prophet's
[1:17:10] message
[1:17:10] come and show me but you ain't gonna
[1:17:14] come and show me
[1:17:14] but you ain't gonna believe it because
[1:17:16] you're gonna think it's some kind of
[1:17:17] mathematic
[1:17:18] it can't be a mathematical
[1:17:25] i'll even give you one that'll flop you
[1:17:28] good
[1:17:29] brother branham says in 1933 to 1977
[1:17:34] i mean 1954
[1:17:39] 33 33-54 i'm trying to get my memory
[1:17:43] back into place
[1:17:46] you're going to wind up with a 44
[1:17:49] instead of a 54.
[1:17:52] if you add 40 years to 33 what do you
[1:17:56] got
[1:18:01] you can't mathematically count it
[1:18:04] brother branham missed it
[1:18:06] on a 10-year period but he didn't miss
[1:18:10] it
[1:18:12] come on folks he didn't miss
[1:18:15] it he was the prophet
[1:18:19] from time elements most of you don't
[1:18:22] even keep up with these things
[1:18:27] do you know that since 33
[1:18:33] your calendar has been changed three
[1:18:38] times
[1:18:41] 33. it's been changed three times
[1:18:44] gregory and pope
[1:18:45] what's the other one alexander is that
[1:18:47] right
[1:18:48] julian julian it's been changed three
[1:18:51] times
[1:18:52] in the change of a calendar you can miss
[1:18:55] 10 years without a problem
[1:19:01] you say what are you saying he was right
[1:19:06] but you say mathematically he was wrong
[1:19:09] he wasn't
[1:19:12] that calendar has been changed three
[1:19:13] times one time they put
[1:19:16] 13 months in a year
[1:19:19] one time they only had 200 something
[1:19:21] days in a year
[1:19:23] because you know when you change your
[1:19:25] calendars you change by the stars and
[1:19:27] everything goes with it
[1:19:31] it very easily can eat up 10 years so he
[1:19:34] went wrong
[1:19:36] if you go across your mathematics and
[1:19:38] run it through what he's saying you'll
[1:19:39] find that there's a 10 years discrepancy
[1:19:43] but they're not
[1:19:46] because that calendar can be eat up that
[1:19:49] much in a hurry
[1:19:52] what are you trying to say let me run
[1:19:54] feist there's a jubilee in the bible
[1:19:56] ever
[1:19:57] seven years go to to deuteronomy
[1:20:00] and remember this
[1:20:04] branham uses the terminology but human
[1:20:06] man uses the terminology
[1:20:08] deuteronomy and the point of exodus
[1:20:14] is not talking about slavery
[1:20:20] so you got that all figured out of a
[1:20:22] slave a slave a slave
[1:20:25] how can a slave go in free at the end of
[1:20:27] six years
[1:20:30] he's a slave you better remember
[1:20:34] that abraham had a slave
[1:20:38] hagar
[1:20:41] israel had slaves of their own it's not
[1:20:44] talking about slavery
[1:20:47] it's talking about when a hebrew buys a
[1:20:49] hebrew my old brother call him money
[1:20:52] i go into bondage to him
[1:20:56] to pay my debt he can only keep me six
[1:20:59] years i don't care how much i owe him
[1:21:01] because that's the law
[1:21:05] and when he sends me out after six years
[1:21:07] i'll read you the bible i got it land
[1:21:09] right there
[1:21:11] he can't let me go home with nothing
[1:21:14] he has to provide for me to be able to
[1:21:18] live until i can
[1:21:19] get back on my feet i'm reading the
[1:21:21] bible do you want it
[1:21:23] read exodus read hebrews i mean uh
[1:21:26] deuteronomy
[1:21:30] see there's things in there you say what
[1:21:31] about that 49 in the church ages
[1:21:33] there ain't no change in the body in the
[1:21:35] ages you got to get out of the ages
[1:21:37] you got to be birthed out of the age to
[1:21:39] be into the point of the bride
[1:21:41] every bride was birthed out of the age
[1:21:43] luther wesley pentecost any of them were
[1:21:45] not in the age
[1:21:46] age-wise humanly yes it's out there
[1:21:49] we're in seven
[1:21:50] we're in the seventh church age yes
[1:21:53] the seven goes all the way to the
[1:21:54] millennium yes
[1:21:57] but we got to be burped out of the age
[1:22:05] if i went into debt with to brother
[1:22:06] colley he could only keep me six years
[1:22:11] in the seventh year he had to let me go
[1:22:17] and he had to provide me with things
[1:22:21] to go i'm reading the bible that's why i
[1:22:24] say have you read the bible
[1:22:27] if you ain't read the bible you don't
[1:22:28] know what i'm talking about
[1:22:30] if you ain't read it and understood it
[1:22:32] from that you don't know what i'm
[1:22:34] talking about
[1:22:38] but you know there's some more things
[1:22:40] the reason is covered in the church ages
[1:22:45] do you know that if i go into bondage to
[1:22:48] brother colley
[1:22:50] he can only keep me six years and prove
[1:22:53] that he's gonna let me go on the seven
[1:22:55] then it goes seven seven is 49 and
[1:22:57] there's a double you got a back to back
[1:22:59] time of releasing
[1:23:00] or you've got the prophet coming in the
[1:23:02] seventh church age to declare the holy
[1:23:04] ghost liberty
[1:23:06] of eternity to you and me and we can go
[1:23:08] into rapture
[1:23:09] but you realize i can read you right out
[1:23:11] of the bible
[1:23:14] if i go into bondage to brother collie
[1:23:16] and i take a wife
[1:23:18] at the end of six years she goes free
[1:23:21] but if i go into bondage to him and he
[1:23:23] gives me a wife
[1:23:25] at the end of the six years my wife
[1:23:27] don't go free
[1:23:29] that's bible some of you shaking your
[1:23:31] head so you'll know it's true
[1:23:32] that's bible all right see they've got
[1:23:36] to stay in bondage to him
[1:23:37] why because the church ages got a
[1:23:39] limitation to it
[1:23:41] there's no change in the body and the
[1:23:42] church ages 7-7 is 49 you don't get none
[1:23:46] you got to go to a 50. but you can have
[1:23:48] a jubilee
[1:23:49] a release every seven years which is the
[1:23:51] holy ghost
[1:23:52] inside of you releasing you
[1:23:57] but if i go into bondage he gives me a
[1:23:59] wife according to the bible the wife
[1:24:01] stays
[1:24:02] i can go to free but when you get to
[1:24:04] leviticus here's what i said while ago
[1:24:06] now listen what did i say a while ago
[1:24:08] that if brother branham would have said
[1:24:11] according to leviticus 25 10 25
[1:24:15] 10 says when you hear that gospel
[1:24:20] everything goes free
[1:24:26] everything goes free read your bible
[1:24:31] well i don't know what brother they'll
[1:24:32] tell them to read the bible and come
[1:24:34] show me if i'm wrong
[1:24:38] they say you're not going to read the
[1:24:40] bible so you're just going to go on your
[1:24:41] own way well i just don't believe it
[1:24:43] okay you're bound to the grave
[1:24:46] and i didn't say lost i said bound to
[1:24:49] the grave
[1:24:51] because only this message can set us
[1:24:56] free
[1:24:59] right come on musicians
[1:25:04] well just wait a minute it's 12 o'clock
[1:25:06] let's stand
[1:25:08] it's this thing i love him if anybody
[1:25:09] has a need the altar is open
[1:25:12] i hope you'll go home and think on these
[1:25:13] i cut a lot of it out
[1:25:16] 1977 was exactly what the prophet said
[1:25:20] just like 1946 was exactly what he said
[1:25:23] this exactly like 19 and 11 was what he
[1:25:26] said it was
[1:25:32] but have we accepted the release
[1:25:37] you got a question on it write it down
[1:25:42] i believe church that in 1977
[1:25:45] you entered a situational i don't know
[1:25:49] how to say it a phase or a state
[1:25:51] or a point that there was a possibility
[1:25:54] of us being set free
[1:25:58] free enough to take a change
[1:26:04] but if we still stay with that then
[1:26:06] we're bored in the early
[1:26:12] that's why everybody thought it was
[1:26:13] slavery because it's not read your bible
[1:26:15] if a hebrew buys a hebrew
[1:26:23] and that hebrew came when that six years
[1:26:26] is done he can't send that guy home
[1:26:28] i'll read you the bible he says you
[1:26:30] can't send that guy home
[1:26:32] why because there is no poor in israel
[1:26:38] he can't send him home empty
[1:26:41] he's got to provide him something that's
[1:26:43] salvation
[1:26:48] and it also says what way to get into 20
[1:26:50] days
[1:26:52] that they never experience those things
[1:26:55] because if you
[1:26:56] enter that seven and don't go on
[1:27:00] you got a problem
[1:27:04] at the people of the message what
[1:27:05] they've entered a time that i declare
[1:27:08] was the greatest release and the bible
[1:27:09] ever known of
[1:27:12] what that there could be a jubilee that
[1:27:15] would sound
[1:27:17] that we could go free of free enough to
[1:27:19] take a change of the body
[1:27:21] there's never been nobody taught nothing
[1:27:23] like that it's this message that covers
[1:27:25] those things
[1:27:28] the opening of the word uh
[1:27:32] love him i
[1:27:36] i love him because he
[1:27:43] first loved
[1:27:49] [Music]
[1:27:56] let's see
[1:28:07] [Music]
[1:28:21] anybody else
[1:28:31] 77 really meant something
[1:28:35] but it wasn't what everybody was looking
[1:28:40] at
[1:28:44] it was the time when this message struck
[1:28:47] the world
[1:28:48] and the greatest thing that could ever
[1:28:49] be was the opening of the word
[1:28:53] he said no i struck it back there come
[1:28:55] on
[1:29:00] it became a jubilee if we had accepted
[1:29:02] it but instead of that it became a
[1:29:04] condemnation
[1:29:07] to turn down this message now you want
[1:29:10] some quotes i mean some thoughts
[1:29:12] did brother branham say 77 would
[1:29:14] terminate the world system
[1:29:15] usher in the millennium et cetera
[1:29:19] you realize when the denominations
[1:29:21] turned this message down
[1:29:23] was 77
[1:29:28] i can show you where brother random says
[1:29:30] the baptist that's in the 50s he said
[1:29:32] just become a denomination
[1:29:34] there was a denomination 200 years for
[1:29:36] them
[1:29:38] but no they hadn't turned down this
[1:29:41] message
[1:29:42] see what caused denominationalism to go
[1:29:44] wrong
[1:29:45] that's why it stated if brother brennan
[1:29:47] made the statement
[1:29:49] i love his statements and what he says
[1:29:52] he may not mean that to you but he said
[1:29:55] the seed shall not be air
[1:29:58] with the shuck
[1:30:04] seed
[1:30:07] now that's exactly backwards it looks
[1:30:10] like he said the shuck won't be iron
[1:30:12] with a seat
[1:30:13] no the seed won't be aired with a shove
[1:30:16] you know where the shuck went 77 they
[1:30:19] headed to the tribulation
[1:30:22] right
[1:30:26] see the the bride's not going to be heir
[1:30:29] with the shook because she's not going
[1:30:30] to the tribulation
[1:30:33] right see your prophet's right we just
[1:30:37] don't listen
[1:30:38] the bible's right we just don't listen
[1:30:40] father just we ask you to dismiss now
[1:30:43] your love be with us and wait this
[1:30:45] afternoon to minister your word
[1:30:46] we love you we thank you we pray that
[1:30:49] what we said has been worthy
[1:30:50] and sorry when it's not so you just help
[1:30:53] us
[1:30:54] we love you and we thank you in jesus
[1:30:57] name
