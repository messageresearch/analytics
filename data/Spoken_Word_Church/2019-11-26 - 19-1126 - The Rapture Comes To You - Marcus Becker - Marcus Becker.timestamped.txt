[3:07] I want to see
[3:14] [Music]
[3:15] now by the music maybe softly is playing
[3:18] let's just bow our heads if you wouldn't
[3:20] mind and if somebody wants that the Lord
[3:23] speaks to him or her person you just
[3:25] raise your hands to God Heavenly Father
[3:27] we so much love these songs father we
[3:31] are already inspired father to pronounce
[3:33] your name and your grace and how great
[3:36] you are and how wonderful you are father
[3:38] may you just speak to our hearts this
[3:41] evening Lord as you lay down my heart to
[3:44] have a real Thanksgiving father Lord may
[3:47] you bless each and every one that is
[3:49] here may you bless your people Israel
[3:52] father and natural Israel the
[3:53] spiritually Israel your bride father
[3:56] Lord we lay ourselves into your presence
[3:59] and say lord help us to go forward to go
[4:03] on father and so we lay everything into
[4:05] your hands ask it in Jesus name Amen god
[4:10] bless you and while we're standing let's
[4:12] open the word of the Lord and you have
[4:15] already heard in the prayer I have quite
[4:17] an accent and you just take what I want
[4:19] to say instead of what I'm saying but
[4:23] let's take let's open in the first book
[4:25] of Kings chapter 19 verse 1 and behold
[4:34] and a hap told Jesse Bell all that
[4:36] Elijah had done and without how he had
[4:40] slain all the prophets with the sword
[4:43] then Jesse belt sent a messenger unto
[4:46] Elijah saying so let the God do for me
[4:49] and more also if I make not thy life as
[4:53] the life of one of them by the morrow
[4:55] about this time when he saw that he
[4:58] aroused and went for his life and came
[5:01] to birth Sheba which belongs to Judah
[5:03] and left his servant there but he
[5:06] himself went a day's journey into the
[5:07] wilderness and came and sat down under a
[5:10] juniper tree and requested for himself
[5:13] that he might die and said it is enough
[5:15] now O Lord take away my life for I am
[5:18] NOT better than my father's and as he
[5:21] lay and slept under a juniper tree
[5:23] behold then an angel touched him and
[5:26] said and said unto
[5:27] arise and eat and he looked and behold
[5:31] there was a cake Baken on the coals in a
[5:34] crucial of water at his head and he did
[5:36] eat and drink and laid him down again
[5:39] and the angel of the Lord came again the
[5:41] second time and touched him and said
[5:43] arise and eat because the journey is too
[5:46] great for thee may the Lord at his
[5:49] blessing to the reading office work we
[5:50] may be seated
[5:53] it's fine for me to put up this jacket
[5:55] thank you very much because I know
[5:57] already have to go to work and therefore
[6:03] now greet you all in the name of the
[6:05] Lord Jesus Christ and it's my great
[6:08] honor after five years to be here back
[6:10] again but the date was aways and you
[6:12] always had some kind like a place in my
[6:15] heart and this church and the Wednesday
[6:19] when I was here and remember was
[6:20] preaching about God remembers and
[6:24] exactly so and so I bring you greetings
[6:26] from my pastor about the road walled and
[6:28] I was here for some meetings over there
[6:30] in Ohio and just connected this time a
[6:33] little bit together and thank you for
[6:36] giving me the time I know it means a lot
[6:38] to do to just invite somebody to show
[6:43] the confidence I truly appreciate this
[6:45] and blessed be the name of the Lord I
[6:49] think brother Lewis and his family for
[6:51] all his friendship and I contacted him
[6:54] that I would be around in the area and
[6:55] it seems that brother Lewis is very
[6:57] proud of his pastor and about this
[6:59] congregation that's what he said yes and
[7:03] that makes it easy because it seems that
[7:06] that and I I'm sure that we have exactly
[7:09] the same vision and in many many things
[7:11] and so I will I will enter directly into
[7:14] the service if you wouldn't mind and we
[7:16] wish you from our hearts God's blessing
[7:18] I hope I don't have to present myself in
[7:22] a certain way we have no message of our
[7:26] own
[7:27] and I hope I'm not hurting your feelings
[7:30] by feeling the message of the hour does
[7:32] not come from America it comes from the
[7:34] presence of all my dear
[7:35] and then exactly so on but but this
[7:40] evening I had that subject on my heart
[7:43] and I'm stopping there where I'm
[7:45] continuing there where I stopped in over
[7:47] there in Ohio I would like to talk this
[7:51] evening about our Father I mean and
[7:56] about a true Thanksgiving I want you to
[8:00] warm our hearts again when we go into
[8:02] the Thanksgiving Day Thanksgiving was in
[8:06] vests invented I think by Lincoln is
[8:08] that correct by Abraham Lincoln
[8:09] Washington or Lincoln one of both and he
[8:13] invented that day of he said as a
[8:16] commemoration of the Living God who gave
[8:19] us that country but it became a barbecue
[8:24] day it became a hunting day it became a
[8:29] dis linen day but this evening we want
[8:33] to think about our Father there's
[8:35] something we have in common with our
[8:37] Father even we might see things a little
[8:40] bit different but we have a wonderful
[8:42] father
[8:42] therefore the depth of we have the same
[8:45] chemistry because we have the same
[8:46] father so please keep in mind that I
[8:49] have one service I'm not I'm not making
[8:52] a teaching but I always like to
[8:54] certainly certainly show a little bit of
[8:55] a picture so keep always one thing in
[8:58] mind if a minister has one service in 90
[9:02] minutes or a little bit less I don't
[9:04] want to take too much out on a Wednesday
[9:05] he cannot bring all the aspects he
[9:07] cannot bring all the balance in all
[9:09] things so bear with me I don't have a
[9:12] special doctrine my father is my
[9:13] doctrine okay you say brother Marcus
[9:16] what kind of doctrine do you have nearer
[9:18] my God to thee that's our doctrine now
[9:21] and say even so let us directly go into
[9:24] into that subject I would like to add
[9:27] call a name that that sermon i don't say
[9:31] i'm preaching messages i'm preaching
[9:33] sermons because the message is preached
[9:35] but that's just a question of the busy
[9:38] expression the rapture comes to you it's
[9:43] not that you are doing something to come
[9:45] into the rapture but the Red River comes
[9:47] to you
[9:48] amen the rapture now now in the time of
[9:51] Jesus the resurrection was an event and
[9:55] was a person jesus said I am the
[9:58] resurrection it's not only when it is a
[10:00] person and we see today the rapture is
[10:03] not only an event it's a person he is
[10:06] the rapture and we as brother Bheema
[10:09] said she becomes him the bride is the
[10:11] rapture in in herself exactly so so in
[10:17] that in that in it at the same time it
[10:20] is an event certainly now that that
[10:23] sermon about what happened here but the
[10:25] Branham preached at different times and
[10:28] he called it what does thou here Elijah
[10:31] and what does thou here Elijah and it it
[10:37] is the story about a man who after his
[10:43] great and tremendous victory over 400
[10:47] preachers and tied as to what happened
[10:50] in brother branham's meaning at the
[10:51] beginning of his ministry 400 preachers
[10:54] in Chicago who see exactly the parallel
[10:57] the time of the evening comes and he's
[10:59] slaughtering all these kind of people
[11:02] and the next day and I say in my own
[11:05] word he got an email of Jezebel and said
[11:08] look the next morning we will do the
[11:10] same what you did to my priest and
[11:12] something happened to that man it was
[11:16] the same God it was the same doctrine it
[11:20] was the same church it was the same
[11:24] Israel but brother Branham said the
[11:27] anointing left the man
[11:30] and that can happen to all of us we have
[11:34] our strong days and we have our weak
[11:36] days we have them and we see that when
[11:41] he went into the wilderness he took his
[11:44] servant with him and after a certain
[11:48] time he left his servant and went alone
[11:50] and brother Brahim said people who come
[11:53] into this condition they want to stay
[11:55] alone that is the moment when they are
[11:59] leaving church they shouldn't do this
[12:01] but it's a human reaction on a situation
[12:05] that I cannot handle brother Ben didn't
[12:09] dramatize that dramatic alized that
[12:12] situation he said his nerves were at the
[12:15] end not more all was well with his soul
[12:20] all was well with God all was well with
[12:23] the message of the hour but his nerves
[12:26] came to an end
[12:27] brother branham explains in the sixties
[12:30] what we would call today a break out
[12:34] brain brain a burn out sister sin that
[12:37] he showed it was too much pressure and
[12:40] ember of the brain says this I never
[12:43] spoke to so much tired people than today
[12:47] and it ties it to a burnout of the
[12:50] people in the 60s now what would he tell
[12:52] today I mean now look
[12:56] sometime and I'm very happy about this
[12:58] good atmosphere but sometime you preach
[13:00] on a Wednesday service and after 15
[13:03] minutes people begin to sleep it was not
[13:06] the bad preach because I didn't hear
[13:08] anything to preach about but they sleep
[13:10] already because it's it's a it's it's
[13:13] hardness of the people but if they would
[13:16] watch Super Bowl they wouldn't sleep you
[13:20] see you have to understand whenever you
[13:22] come into a church there is a fight
[13:25] going on and you sit down and Satan
[13:28] comes and and therefore we should be
[13:34] awake we should be there
[13:37] and you say Amen but it's it's it's a
[13:40] sign of that time and what happened is
[13:43] he wanted to be alone and he came to the
[13:47] point that he wanted you just to die and
[13:51] that was the moment when God had to
[13:55] react brother Bram said if you are on
[13:59] your post of duty God is determined or
[14:04] he is obligated to help us exactly so so
[14:09] God did not send a social worker God
[14:13] didn't send an evangelist to say come on
[14:16] you have the message of here come come
[14:17] come come no no that was not helpful I
[14:20] told it again before there was a great
[14:26] pianist by the name of Arthur Rubinstein
[14:29] and after Rubinstein was asked the
[14:32] question is it difficult to play piano
[14:35] he says playing piano is very simple you
[14:38] just have to put down the right keys at
[14:41] the right time so simple it's so simple
[14:46] it's now you know just the right key
[14:47] cetera so it's already there while you
[14:49] studied you just have to make the right
[14:51] thing so so to have a spiritual
[14:54] leadership to help a person in a
[14:56] depressed way it's very simple you just
[15:00] have to be the right person at the right
[15:02] time in the right place at the right
[15:05] spirit saying the right thing and he
[15:07] must be in the right spirit to receive
[15:10] you in the right way so it's very simple
[15:13] sometime if we go to difficult stages in
[15:17] our life no word is the best word that
[15:21] is not a time when I need biblical
[15:23] verses or slogans even not a quotation
[15:27] that's fine but it must be the right
[15:29] word at the right time if not it even
[15:32] hurts even more my feeling so God knew
[15:35] this God's came down and send an angel
[15:38] God is help willingly to help his
[15:41] children now
[15:44] this is the this is the thought of this
[15:46] whole evening in you wills we will see
[15:48] it in the message
[15:49] when you did your best when do you did
[15:55] your best and you come to the end
[15:57] brother Branham says God will send the
[15:59] same angel to you we would see this even
[16:04] in God is not sitting in heaven and said
[16:06] I will see who will make it was the
[16:07] rapture no God will find his children
[16:11] and you you do you do your part and he
[16:14] will do his spots you do your part you
[16:17] don't put your hands in the pockets
[16:19] Eddie no you do your part but be sure
[16:22] you will not make it without God no
[16:25] matter how long hair we have no matter
[16:27] what we do no matter how if God doesn't
[16:31] come down to help us we will not make it
[16:33] can you say Amen that brother mem said
[16:37] if you did your best and you're finished
[16:40] God will send the same angel hallelujah
[16:44] so that angel he had something to eat
[16:48] now first he laid him down sleeping
[16:52] coming down his nerves but the brem said
[16:55] I'm right now myself under the juniper
[16:58] tree he said that that that prophet
[17:01] needed some rest and some care and
[17:07] brother brems that God sent I say in my
[17:09] own words
[17:10] send the angels was the nicest hand just
[17:13] to care about him it's just - here's my
[17:17] prophet knees worn-out he's broken just
[17:20] lift him up again that's our Father he's
[17:24] taking care of us now why he was laying
[17:28] there and he woke the angel woke him up
[17:30] and there was he gave him something to
[17:33] eat some cookies and brother Brahim said
[17:37] he said I want to know which vitamins
[17:40] were in those cookies because with the
[17:43] power of those cookies he went 40 days
[17:46] and 40 nights can you say Amen
[17:50] let's be the name of the Lord remember
[17:53] this the message that we believe is not
[17:55] a doctrine it's not a book of behavior
[17:59] the message is our Father speaking to us
[18:03] he just used a vessel but the origin
[18:07] comes from our Father now if a man loves
[18:10] a woman and he writes her as some love
[18:12] letters now that woman will not embrace
[18:15] the postman she will embrace the one who
[18:17] let who wrote the letter
[18:19] can you say Amen therefore we are not
[18:22] Branagh mites
[18:23] we are not premised we did not we do not
[18:27] marry Eliezer Amen but it was only
[18:31] Eliezer bringing us to a to Isaac which
[18:34] is Christ the word but the bride marries
[18:37] Isaac and unfortunately good people
[18:41] trying to marry Eliezer brother Brennan
[18:43] but that's not so we marry the word can
[18:47] you say Amen
[18:48] so there was something special in those
[18:51] cookies and I always say this in my word
[18:55] the message that we believe is red bull
[19:00] it's red bull now I was I was a small
[19:04] boy when I was I was in school and I
[19:08] remember that that I had a little bit
[19:10] complexes because I was just a smaller
[19:12] than a very thin boy so I had two
[19:15] favorites in my life that was are not
[19:18] Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone so
[19:22] and and I made some kind like a
[19:24] bodybuilding at that time and I want to
[19:26] tell you brothers not to be funny but is
[19:30] a true sphere I want to speak to the
[19:31] young brothers everything that you see
[19:33] here was here but this was just a trim
[19:37] just a changing of this will say so
[19:41] so you can you can work out whatever you
[19:45] want but one day it will be here so
[19:47] don't invest too much time in body but
[19:49] you can do this nothing against but soul
[19:52] building is much more important don't
[19:54] forget the so big exactly so and I
[19:57] remember that I was seeing a film of
[20:00] Arnaud Schwarz I think it was Conan and
[20:02] he was just using his breast muscle like
[20:04] this and that was a young boy and made
[20:08] bodybuilding and I went before the
[20:09] mirror but but nothing was moving so I
[20:12] had to I had to add add to it had to
[20:15] work out again so but what I found out
[20:18] is if you want to have muscles you
[20:21] cannot eat McDonald's and if you want to
[20:25] have spiritual muscles you cannot eat
[20:27] Facebook and you cannot eat whatsapp the
[20:30] whole day that's fine Ivan what's a part
[20:32] you need a spiritual food in due seasons
[20:35] it's the right message can you say Amen
[20:40] so therefore it's so so so wonderful now
[20:43] that scenery that we have seen here now
[20:46] tie to our time when the angel of
[20:50] revelation 10 comes down and what does
[20:53] he have any sense something to eat keep
[20:55] the book and you will have strength to
[20:58] make the journey therefore we have so
[21:01] much weak people in this message because
[21:04] they just join to say I'm in the Messi
[21:07] that's not enough you have to eat the
[21:09] book you have to feed yourself figure
[21:12] soul heart because face has hair on its
[21:16] chest that's what the Prophet said can
[21:19] you say Amen so that's that so important
[21:22] God did not leave his prophet alone God
[21:29] wasn't just there and say ok that's your
[21:31] problem
[21:32] God said in heaven now you stood from me
[21:36] now I still for you brother sister it
[21:39] matters to serve the Lord
[21:40] it matters to come to church it made us
[21:44] to pay try thinks it matters to pray
[21:46] because God remembers those things
[21:50] they say Amen every person who doesn't
[21:52] pay that tithing shows he has no
[21:54] revelation about God it's not it's not
[21:56] it's not a law food is not a legalistic
[21:59] thing it's a question of understanding
[22:00] who my father is
[22:01] and how my father will bless me for
[22:03] every penny can you say Amen
[22:06] so our life will be part of our life
[22:09] will express our revelation now the
[22:13] message comes to you because one thing
[22:17] is clear brother Branham did not only
[22:22] reveal people's life your name is Eva
[22:26] and I'll see you in a car accident that
[22:28] was the first and the second poll but
[22:32] brother Branham revealed the heart of
[22:34] God and I want you to put on a spiritual
[22:39] jacket because it seems to be like a
[22:42] little funny story but it's the stairs
[22:44] the truths behind brother Branham was
[22:47] around mighty man mighty man from the
[22:53] Bible College and they made a little bit
[22:56] fun of him and saying brother Brahim you
[22:58] don't know your Bible because these
[23:00] people God Lindsay and so they could
[23:04] speak Hebrew Greek whatever men so that
[23:07] let me know brother pray me you don't
[23:09] know your Bible like you should a number
[23:12] of the men said this I may not know the
[23:14] Bible like I should but I know the
[23:15] author of the Bible and we say like
[23:18] that's a funny slogan because we think
[23:19] about Pentecostal things and and and and
[23:22] here's the healing and here's the
[23:23] healing here see but what does he say he
[23:26] said I know the nature of the one who
[23:29] wrote the book and you will first
[23:32] understand the buyer if you know the
[23:34] nature of the one who wrote it
[23:35] do you understand it and then we will
[23:38] see the nature of this message because
[23:41] if we have the message without the
[23:44] nature of God we become dogmatic we
[23:48] become hearts we become arrogant we
[23:51] become Pharisees I mean all we become
[23:55] worldly all things everything will be
[23:57] hard but if you understand how our
[23:59] Father things then we think I want to be
[24:02] like you
[24:03] can you say Amen this message reveals
[24:06] how our what Martin Luther could
[24:09] have preached I mean even Paul could not
[24:12] afraid it's a mystery
[24:13] amen which was held junior section said
[24:17] never was light upon that white rock
[24:19] never ever since that since the
[24:21] foundation of the world evening Paul
[24:23] never revealed it that is that is
[24:26] because it's our time some of the things
[24:28] is revealed in our time because it was
[24:30] never able before how many therefore I
[24:33] told the weekend you see the book of
[24:35] Esther Esther never was mentioned in the
[24:38] Bible in New Testament Paul never
[24:41] mentioned it
[24:42] Martin Luther said the book of Esther
[24:45] should be thrown into the river that's
[24:47] what he said because as the book of
[24:49] Esther first is a feminist book second
[24:52] instead it's a Jewish book to Jewish
[24:54] third God is not even mentioned in the
[24:57] whole book they're formed of devil he
[25:00] said now this book of Esther should be
[25:01] thrown into the river now brother
[25:03] Brennan picks it up and preaches and
[25:05] shows we added Esther I mean because he
[25:09] speaks about the marriage of the lamb
[25:11] and speaks about s that's our time of
[25:13] marriage that we live can you say Amen
[25:15] because this is a special time who is
[25:18] Esther we are Esther can you say Amen
[25:21] now our Father has a nature and I want
[25:26] to say this it is right to brag upon our
[25:32] Father and we want to do it this evening
[25:36] and I'm not the only one I'm just a
[25:39] preacher but we can just say now our
[25:42] brother Marcus that is nothing than the
[25:44] truth
[25:44] because our father is such a wonderful
[25:48] person
[25:50] haria
[25:52] they say men so so before I show you and
[25:58] I I make it really convincing that don't
[26:01] be don't be don't be don't don't don't
[26:02] don't be afraid but I want to show you
[26:05] why God had to come down into this
[26:07] generation hallelujah keep these things
[26:11] in mind we're still waiting for him to
[26:13] come keep a balance Christ has come but
[26:16] we are still waiting for him to meet him
[26:18] in the air
[26:19] okay keep a balance in all things okay
[26:22] for me it is not meeting in the air let
[26:25] me say traveling beside the moon is for
[26:28] me it's a changing of dimension but that
[26:31] is Marcus if somebody somebody told me
[26:32] brother Marcus I see different and I
[26:34] said okay let's both go into the rapture
[26:36] and we will see how it was okay but but
[26:40] I always keep a balance in those things
[26:42] so let me just show you some of the
[26:44] pictures to understand what happened to
[26:48] the message of the hour and why a
[26:51] message believer cannot go back into a
[26:55] denomination there's no way if he says
[26:59] okay there is Jesus - then I want to say
[27:01] brother you never understood anything
[27:02] from the beginning or sister and we will
[27:06] see - he cannot go back into a former
[27:10] age is not possible because there's
[27:12] nothing to find there it's just a mirage
[27:15] it's just a nostalgic way of thinking
[27:19] about things that are not real anymore
[27:21] can you say Amen hallelujah and maybe if
[27:25] the brothers would help me to - just -
[27:27] just - just now that is that is the
[27:30] thing that is the pyramid that brother
[27:33] Branham was was was was showing in the
[27:37] message the stature of a perfect man and
[27:40] the only thing that I was doing is is is
[27:43] showing the anointings and the
[27:45] messengers not more exactly so just put
[27:48] it in right now now now we have to
[27:51] understand one thing that the birth of
[27:56] the church was a Pentecost as what the
[27:58] Prophet says
[27:59] now between the birth of the church in
[28:02] the first churches were twenty years and
[28:04] brother brems says in the resume of the
[28:06] church he said the church was already a
[28:08] fallen woman I'm exactly so and there is
[28:11] a beginning in the church you see
[28:13] brother Marcus how how do you know this
[28:15] now I show you by the Bible that no
[28:19] apostle understood who the first
[28:22] messenger was now as Paul was not in the
[28:27] upper room brother Branham was not in
[28:29] Azusa Street both came later brother
[28:33] Brahim did not come to bring a
[28:35] Pentecostal revive because the
[28:36] Pentecostal was already on without a
[28:40] prophet being there both had to fall in
[28:44] order to show there must be something
[28:46] deeper and higher and bigger than he
[28:48] thinks so my question is why should I
[28:51] turn back to something that fell in the
[28:52] beginning now I always say this the
[28:56] timing that we live there was never a
[28:58] day than this day before I mean right
[29:03] but the beginning of the church was at
[29:06] Pentecost so blessed be the name of the
[29:08] Lord and Paul came to lay a foundation
[29:12] he said I was born I was sent to be a
[29:16] wise masterbuilder to lay a foundation
[29:18] but you cannot live in a house which
[29:21] just has a foundation you need the walls
[29:24] and at the end you have to put on a roof
[29:27] on that house and then it becomes a
[29:30] house so so even that they're dead
[29:34] that's Logan let's go back to Pentecost
[29:37] it's nothing wrong with the slogan as
[29:41] long as we understand that we have young
[29:43] people in this message in there need a
[29:45] new verse there neither Holy Ghost
[29:48] because we have some of the youngsters
[29:50] they are just religious in the message
[29:53] therefore they try to be as worldly as
[29:56] the aunts to come to church because they
[29:57] were never called they need a beginning
[30:00] they need a foundation
[30:02] brother ever 16 years old daughter I
[30:04] don't want to see him religious in the
[30:06] message I want her to catch the vision
[30:09] that she can say that god of my father
[30:11] is my god the joy of my father is my joy
[30:15] can you say Amen
[30:17] so back to Pentecost yes but not back to
[30:22] a former age but not back 200 or 2000
[30:27] years ago not at all because God never
[30:30] goes back God goes forward and the
[30:33] Prophet said you cannot live a life
[30:35] looking into the real mirror mirror you
[30:37] have to go forward so the slogan back to
[30:40] penny because it is in order as as long
[30:43] as it is placed correctly if it's not
[30:46] placed correctly you go back into a
[30:48] mirage and we're not doing this can you
[30:51] say Amen because this is a tremendous as
[30:54] the time of a capping of the pyramid
[30:57] this is now we had seven messengers our
[31:01] two messengers were special because only
[31:03] miss only one messenger was able to
[31:05] write the Bible that was Paul all the
[31:08] other ones were just reformist and the
[31:11] seventh one was able to reveal the seven
[31:13] thunders and here we're special only the
[31:16] seventh one had the third Pole only the
[31:19] seventh one had the ability to create
[31:22] all the rest brother brother said to me
[31:24] brother knows but there were signs and
[31:26] wonders signs and wonders were already
[31:28] in the Old Testaments and where do you
[31:31] want to go back to Judaism or what I
[31:33] mean we have something that they never
[31:35] had before
[31:36] this is Sir Paul time this was the birth
[31:39] of the church but now we live in the
[31:41] adoption now we're living the invisible
[31:44] unity of Christ and his bride it's a
[31:47] special time and we are not despised in
[31:50] the beginning not at all it's tremendous
[31:52] but we have more than they ever had none
[31:56] of the apostle in the first church age
[31:58] said look Peter never said look stop
[32:00] gentlemen stop with our counsel we have
[32:05] a messenger here Paul is the first
[32:07] message of God blindly had at the eyes
[32:09] because when Paul would have been in the
[32:11] first church age they would have very
[32:12] wretched they would
[32:14] they would have already gone into the
[32:15] rapture they would have never been
[32:17] seduced okay say but God allowed because
[32:21] in Georgia 2019 are still predestinated
[32:25] see they have to come and God kept the
[32:28] door open he said look can you say Amen
[32:31] therefore I said what I said this
[32:33] morning or this weekend we don't have a
[32:36] pope in this message if somebody feels
[32:39] to be a Pope we should change the church
[32:41] go to the Catholic Church
[32:42] the actual pope is relatively old maybe
[32:46] you can get its job later but I don't
[32:48] know if you make it and what we don't
[32:50] have is a Sanhedrin Council in the
[32:53] message if it's not in the message at
[32:56] all if people think they can they will
[32:58] Debbie said let's go back to the UPC
[33:01] they have it or please go back to
[33:03] Judaism we have neither Apple nor we
[33:05] have a have a council every Church its
[33:08] sovereign before God
[33:09] they say Amen let's be the name of the
[33:12] Lord therefore in in the plan of God
[33:15] never nobody preached you in and nobody
[33:19] will preach you out if this church is
[33:22] God's will nobody will preach the church
[33:24] all of the message we said my brother
[33:26] maybe you see it different but God
[33:27] placed us here and you discuss with my
[33:30] father about it can you say Amen so
[33:33] there's no Pope in the message in
[33:34] there's no Sanhedrin Council who thinks
[33:36] now to me this is messaging this is not
[33:38] brother go home you say Amen
[33:41] look this is just a special time in that
[33:44] we live you make the next one please
[33:46] I mean because the rapture comes to you
[33:49] I mean now that's what that's what the
[33:51] Prophet said in in in in revelation
[33:55] chapter one I have to read it myself
[33:56] therefore I was printing out these
[33:58] things just give me a second
[34:01] now he said now if you notice revelation
[34:05] 4:1 we find Jesus standing in the seven
[34:07] church ages the seven golden
[34:08] candlesticks when he turned and saw one
[34:10] like the Son of man standing closed how
[34:13] it was it was the bride standing in the
[34:15] candlestick brought out so if the bride
[34:18] is there and the marriage is there now
[34:20] somebody is missing it's the bridegroom
[34:22] it's a word the entire Holy Ghost must
[34:25] visit the church it's the time that
[34:27] we live in can you say Amen next one
[34:29] please
[34:30] and it's a special time that we live I
[34:32] mean now look at this when God sent the
[34:38] message and the messenger God send them
[34:44] to heal the people God said do not fear
[34:48] I'm sent from the presence of God to
[34:51] tell you that you procured a particular
[34:53] person you're peculiar life has been to
[34:55] indicate yet you are taking a gift of
[34:57] divine healing to the people of the
[34:59] world now make a stop here
[35:01] and think twice God loves human beings
[35:09] that's the nature of our Father and if
[35:13] you have that nature if you are you love
[35:16] people even those who disagree with you
[35:22] because when those people came into the
[35:25] prayer line brother Brendan asked now
[35:27] are you a Christian do you pay your
[35:30] tithe things do this it was just
[35:32] somebody in need and God wants to help
[35:34] somebody who is in need if he's a Muslim
[35:36] is a Muslim let him be what God made him
[35:38] to be but we have a message to go on
[35:40] there's a mess there's a thought that
[35:42] brother Brian said he said life is
[35:45] precious in the eyes of God and you see
[35:49] an unbeliever and we sometimes we think
[35:52] we can step over him but don't step over
[35:54] him don't step over him because for this
[35:57] man is maybe for one little girl her
[36:00] daddy and sure for one mama it's her son
[36:04] and for us that person has no value for
[36:07] about for daddy mama he it is her boy or
[36:10] maybe he says this is madness my papa
[36:13] he's in alcohol problems life is
[36:16] precious in the eyes of God brother we
[36:19] start sometime I hear slogans even in
[36:22] the message you can see it's a spirit
[36:24] it's an anointing first we speak let me
[36:27] say disrespectful about unbelievers fine
[36:30] okay then we speak disrespectfully about
[36:32] denominations let them give their place
[36:34] then we speak disrespectfully about all
[36:36] those and the message
[36:38] exactly like us then movie at the end
[36:40] we're in a one-man denomination the only
[36:42] one that we respect brother
[36:44] everyone needs a certain form of a
[36:46] respect a dignity rather we don't have
[36:49] television at home but but but there is
[36:53] a certain program I'm not I'm as I'm
[36:55] working I'm still aware of these things
[36:56] there's a program in Germany which says
[36:59] it's some like America's Idol something
[37:01] like this
[37:02] Germany searches the superstar and the
[37:05] the idea of the program is is as follows
[37:08] it is the young people that present
[37:10] themselves and they sing and the the
[37:13] tribunal D those who are judging it they
[37:16] are making fun about these people they
[37:18] have humiliated them rights right before
[37:20] the others that's that's the spirit of
[37:22] it make fun of it
[37:24] now as wrong as the Protestant churches
[37:28] and as far away as it is from God but he
[37:30] was an intelligent man he was writing an
[37:32] open letter to that television station
[37:35] he said we see how these people are
[37:38] humilated online before millions of
[37:41] people he said did you forget that every
[37:44] human being is made in the image of God
[37:46] and there is a dignity that goes along
[37:51] with a person no matter how wrong he is
[37:55] now manages that dignity this goes along
[37:57] with a person can you say Amen I know
[38:01] that I'm now sending is saying now a
[38:03] good sentence and that you say your
[38:04] heart brother Marcus you are our
[38:06] sweetheart but I said at a at a
[38:08] ministers meeting and that was a young
[38:10] brother he was speaking a little bit
[38:11] about retirement and he's as a brother
[38:13] God honors gray hair God honors gray
[38:19] hair that means because it's a lot of
[38:21] life wisdom behind gray hair and God
[38:25] will only bless a young man if he knows
[38:27] how to honor all the people because they
[38:30] proved already in their life that
[38:32] they're standing I mean I know you
[38:35] always say brother Marc you're a
[38:36] sweetheart for us no I know but that
[38:39] that that is exactly so but but what
[38:42] happens when the Prophet came on the
[38:45] scene make the next one please
[38:46] when the Prophet came on the scene that
[38:50] is the life of brother Brennan
[38:52] now I want you to put again the
[38:54] spiritual jacket when you came on earth
[38:59] God never asked you do you want to be
[39:03] American do you want to be white do you
[39:07] want to be black sometimes we have
[39:10] families I personally come from a
[39:13] divorced family something we have
[39:15] families with very difficult backgrounds
[39:18] um and it was not your fault to be born
[39:21] in this situation I mean if your father
[39:23] was an alcoholic you had a heart young
[39:25] at heart use I mean and God placed you
[39:31] there and God knew what he did but we
[39:36] did not choose neither our births but
[39:40] God not knew one thing here is the
[39:43] family of God before I make just a
[39:45] picture before the foundation of the
[39:46] world a man we were we were we are not
[39:50] arrogant because brother brems said if
[39:52] you want to continue with God never have
[39:54] an arrogant spirit in your heart but we
[39:56] are proud of our Father we are proud of
[39:59] who we are Paul said I'm not boasting
[40:03] about the human the GD the outward man
[40:06] but I'm boasting about the man that I
[40:08] saw 40 years ago ago for me that was his
[40:11] own theophany but that's Marcus okay but
[40:14] here's the family of God and God just
[40:16] made a picture and then he took our
[40:20] lives and he was just bring it in seven
[40:24] Church ages some in America some in
[40:26] Australia some there some in Luther's
[40:28] ate some in in Paul say something
[40:30] brother branham saying God knows one
[40:32] thing at the end of all time the whole
[40:35] family of God will began together
[40:38] well the man said God will not lose one
[40:42] of his attributes and he says God is not
[40:45] complete without you can you say Amen
[40:48] and God knows one thing my sheep hear my
[40:50] voice he speaks up among the messenger
[40:53] through the messenger but God some time
[40:57] placed us in difficult situation and he
[41:00] knows it and he places us in bodies that
[41:04] we don't like now you have in America it
[41:08] slogan that we have in Germany the same
[41:10] way a person is standing in his own way
[41:13] and that is most of our problem is not
[41:17] brother stones or sisters also as our
[41:20] speech the weaken is the self in us
[41:22] except brother Graham said that was the
[41:25] curtain behind the between the sanctuary
[41:28] and the holy so it's a South will
[41:30] exactly so the self so God place us with
[41:34] a certain temperament now put on the
[41:36] spiritual jacket we were Pentecostals
[41:38] when we came to the message and we
[41:41] thought when the Holy Ghost comes
[41:43] everything is soft and we did not
[41:45] understand the Baptist of the Holy Ghost
[41:47] is the beginning of all things not the
[41:50] end it's the beginning it's the
[41:52] beginning of my gross amen
[41:55] I mean we thought the Holy Ghost comes
[41:58] and we are completely new creations yes
[41:59] potentially but then now God has to do
[42:02] the word and it takes some time a
[42:03] lifetime till we are molded into that
[42:05] image
[42:06] so here's brother Branham and you have
[42:10] to you have to message on the wings of a
[42:15] snow white dove brother brems said I
[42:17] always was a neurotic but imagine what
[42:22] he says I was a neurotic before my new
[42:24] Birds with the Holy Ghost and after I
[42:27] was old as state to be a neurotic and
[42:30] then he says this I am a melancholic
[42:34] that's what the Prophet said many times
[42:36] I mean that's what the Bible speaks
[42:38] about Elijah was a man of likewise
[42:40] passion brother brems said he was a
[42:42] melancholic type of a person I mean and
[42:45] you still have it even with the Holy
[42:47] Ghost
[42:48] and it's not a problem in this but it it
[42:51] shows some actions that we have I'm how
[42:55] we stay in our own way and brother
[42:56] Graham said this he said you have to
[43:01] know your weaknesses and then you
[43:03] protect your weaknesses by prayer
[43:07] exactly so but we have that nature that
[43:10] we didn't didn't want to have but God
[43:13] places in body so to make it all hell is
[43:18] against you o natural outside is against
[43:24] you and even your own self is against
[43:27] you and the only one who is a true
[43:29] believer is he eaten eternal part that
[43:32] God placed in your soul can you say amen
[43:35] amen
[43:37] therefore look brother man full of the
[43:40] Holy Ghost the seals are open and I'm
[43:43] not going to a step because for
[43:44] Wednesday evening but about let me give
[43:46] you an example
[43:47] no I will not give you because because
[43:49] that I'm taking away by the time but now
[43:51] this is re I become I have a subject to
[43:56] to to really focus in but look look look
[43:59] brother Brian in 1963 me standing in the
[44:02] gap I mean the seals are open did
[44:04] brother man to have the Holy Ghost
[44:05] certainly at the Holy Ghost but he
[44:07] wanted to give up and he said it was
[44:09] because of the people then let me know I
[44:11] was not able enough exactly so and so he
[44:15] stopped the car and God said look to the
[44:17] west he said that's your life exactly so
[44:21] that is your life seven seven seven
[44:24] peaks three poles now I asked you the
[44:28] question when did those mountain came
[44:31] came up do you think that was 96 is free
[44:35] that God said he came up when God
[44:37] created the earth
[44:38] he knew my seventh angels a melancholic
[44:42] type of a person and God says to brother
[44:44] Benny if you ever have a doubt in your
[44:46] mind come back to this
[44:49] can you say Amen so so so when when my
[44:53] god speaks to brother branham you have
[44:56] to have to understand one thing
[44:57] you you came out wrong on this earth
[45:01] though in America you are on the lucky
[45:04] side of life and we in Germany on the
[45:08] lucky side of life you say brother
[45:10] Marcus mr. Trump is right I mean all
[45:13] these Mexicans and all these from
[45:14] Honduras let's make a wall that's right
[45:16] and we say the same thing you know let
[45:18] them drown in the military military and
[45:22] see you see let them stay in Turkey but
[45:25] if God would have placed you in Mexico
[45:27] you would think different you would have
[45:31] a baby of nothing to feed amen we have a
[45:34] brother living in Venezuela and the
[45:36] other day yes there's a brother there's
[45:40] a president by the name of Maduro say so
[45:43] so so so so let me say in my own words
[45:46] idiotic that the people of now anything
[45:49] anything to eat now what do you do then
[45:51] you have to say only believe the same
[45:52] way God places here on the lucky side of
[45:55] life thank you Father thank you Jesus I
[45:58] mean blessed be but God could have
[46:00] placed us God a good God could have
[46:02] placed your soul in a boat in a body
[46:05] which is handicapped and still it's the
[46:09] same God that's the be the name God can
[46:12] place you in a rich family God can place
[46:14] you in a poor family and and you say
[46:19] brother Marcus we had a denominational
[46:22] idea of now when we come to the law we
[46:24] presents everybody you know I brought
[46:27] five to the role and here's all my
[46:28] children and look at what a something
[46:32] you have nobody to present we have
[46:36] brothers in the church where the whole
[46:37] family doesn't come to church anymore
[46:39] I tell the brother I said look brother
[46:41] you will not help those families if you
[46:43] stay alone if you stay man and now at
[46:46] home he said you serve the Lord you
[46:48] would see what God will do
[46:49] I said at least at the white throne
[46:52] judgment you will see them again becomes
[46:58] a sister and in in the denominational
[47:00] world they thought I mean a system us to
[47:02] evangelize and that sister she lost her
[47:05] husband and the other sister asked her
[47:07] look what will you present to Jesus when
[47:09] he comes you did not Nathalie you just
[47:12] raised up the family you did not
[47:14] eventually us here and there knew what
[47:15] that sister said she I will show him my
[47:18] hands how I worked for the family that
[47:21] was that was the thing to honor God
[47:23] something you have to say I don't have
[47:25] no trophy but I am the Prophet Rafi I
[47:28] made it I came through against all odds
[47:31] I never gave up
[47:33] I am the trophy of God can you say Amen
[47:37] let's be the name of the Lord so
[47:39] therefore you have to understand one
[47:41] thing and and and it's it I think the
[47:44] thought is clear from the Bible if you
[47:47] will have a theophany you have it
[47:50] already because the Bible says if our
[47:54] when our earthly tents will be dissolved
[47:57] we have a body which is not made by hand
[48:01] but which is eternal that means that
[48:04] body is eternal and brother MAME said
[48:05] there's always the orphan so God we're
[48:10] not before you die ten minutes before
[48:12] you die think will you get at your
[48:17] phanie digi paste I think what you
[48:22] always nice to Marcus Becker
[48:25] see that was our understanding but but
[48:28] God gave you the victory already before
[48:31] you were born it was already there
[48:33] therefore brother Branham said any bring
[48:35] any any opens that mystery he shows the
[48:39] life of death of that woman at the well
[48:41] how she was frauded or discouraged by by
[48:46] her first husband and she throws away
[48:48] her life and she got from one husband to
[48:50] the next and the Bible said he had to
[48:52] pass by Samaria and brother Brent said
[48:55] because she had a representation of the
[48:58] thoughts of God no matter what it is to
[49:01] my understand it says he often but
[49:03] that's Marcus I might be wrong in this
[49:05] but one thing is sure if she had
[49:07] representation from the thoughts of God
[49:09] that means she did not get a
[49:11] representation because Jesus came by but
[49:14] Jesus came by because she had already a
[49:17] representation brother sister I tell you
[49:22] those who were in the world God took
[49:24] care of already of you when you never
[49:26] thought about him you were already in
[49:29] his mind God you had already an angel
[49:31] protecting you because he elects his
[49:33] angels and you were in the world you are
[49:35] the discotheque you are saying God says
[49:37] I have to pay attention my child makes
[49:39] too much to try to soothe you understand
[49:42] and then we're gonna say how our father
[49:44] cared for us and the same father who
[49:48] cared will bring you home Ramiro and it
[49:52] will be him bringing me home swing low
[49:57] Sweet Chariot coming for to carry me Oh
[50:07] can you say Amen so that's your life God
[50:14] didn't give us a nice life for none of
[50:17] us you say or if I would be in that
[50:18] family every child of God has their
[50:22] challenges some here and some there
[50:24] everybody has because character is
[50:27] molded by by this circumstance but I
[50:29] want to say one thing if you are on the
[50:31] mountaintop
[50:32] don't be arrogance oh if I see that
[50:36] family and the children
[50:38] I don't understand and courses you don't
[50:42] understand I will show you if it's not
[50:44] my hand you're sure and go go go do
[50:46] anything the same thing so if we're on
[50:48] the mountaintop don't become arrogant
[50:50] but if you are in the valley don't give
[50:52] up don't give up because if you're in
[50:55] the valley the next mountain will come
[50:58] because there's a power that brings me
[51:00] home can you say Amen and next one
[51:04] please I'm gone I'm just going through I
[51:06] mean now here what here's what happened
[51:09] now when the Prophet came as I told you
[51:11] I have to read like this sorry for this
[51:15] because when the Prophet came his whole
[51:19] ministry was the healing part right but
[51:22] others could now let me say others could
[51:26] we reproduce what the Prophet did even
[51:30] more healings you see these ministries
[51:34] like like Swami Osbourne he was sitting
[51:37] in brother brems meeting he said what he
[51:40] does I can do the same is they all come
[51:44] out of the minister brother branham and
[51:45] it had tremendous healings but one thing
[51:47] is sure they had no message no message
[51:51] because a father is the head of his home
[51:55] pastors the head of the local church
[51:57] Christ is the head of the men of the age
[52:00] the messengers the head of the age
[52:02] Christ is the head of all seven
[52:04] messengers so the bride is the final
[52:07] voice in the final age under her
[52:10] messenger okay say Amen so loud is here
[52:14] at many tremendous men one of them is
[52:17] Jimmy Swaggart single again sisters but
[52:21] only one had a voice
[52:23] only one had a voice can you say Amen so
[52:27] brother why should I read books of all
[52:30] kind of theologians knowing that they
[52:32] don't have a clue about the truth the
[52:34] word comes to the Prophet can say Amen
[52:37] if you have too much time read all kinds
[52:39] of books but we are pressed in some way
[52:41] we don't have time to to lose we get in
[52:43] the message directly him say Amen so but
[52:46] there is there is a changing and the
[52:49] Prophet explains it because coming to
[52:53] church or coming to these great meetings
[52:56] became an entertainment for the people
[53:00] brother and that is what we see even
[53:02] when we see many of these I'm a camp
[53:06] speaker that's how I'm invited people
[53:08] say brother Marcus the young people's
[53:10] pizza is a use Minister that's fine
[53:12] nothing if it's for that so we go to use
[53:14] camps but sometimes we've seen it became
[53:16] an entertainment for them exactly
[53:19] there's no changing there's no sincerity
[53:21] in that whole thing you see sometime you
[53:23] can even a local church you see I was
[53:26] new in our local church in here comes
[53:27] some youngsters they came in like this
[53:29] in the church I wonder myself who the
[53:32] parents were but Zulu soon I found out
[53:34] who the parents were because they came
[53:36] that is no sanctuary you wonder you're
[53:40] so hey do you speak to your father do
[53:42] you know is here we believe in a church
[53:44] like this the same pillar of fire that
[53:46] was with brother man must be here must
[53:49] be here if not we are just making nice
[53:52] speeches we believe wherever the message
[53:54] of God is preached God is there power of
[53:57] transformation so God says we have now
[54:00] to change the program he said this and
[54:02] and this is called the détente vision
[54:07] okay
[54:08] first full second potent vision I seen
[54:11] them bring a lady on a stretcher and
[54:13] there was a lady there taking her name
[54:15] sings on a paper and there was someone
[54:17] got her pushed her through the next man
[54:20] comes through with his crutches I see
[54:22] them go through that little building and
[54:23] on the outside the lady came out
[54:25] screaming to the top of her voice
[54:27] pushing the stretcher and then there was
[54:29] another lady on the other side looked
[54:30] like kind of a dark head woman and she
[54:32] said what happened she said I just don't
[54:34] know we could continue
[54:36] now now make a stop here the 10th vision
[54:41] this is now Marcus okay the best of my
[54:45] understanding the 10th vision is that
[54:49] brother REM sees that the pillar of fire
[54:51] went from him over little tent or he
[54:55] calls it a wooden building now if you
[54:58] take that vision literally and it must
[55:02] be a tent like they try to do I think in
[55:05] Nicaragua then the question is we poor
[55:08] Germans we will never come to that tent
[55:11] now if the change is in Germany you poor
[55:13] Americans we have to pay a lot of
[55:15] dollars to come to that tent so
[55:17] according to my understanding it has a
[55:19] symbolic meaning and who was the first
[55:22] one who had a tent vision that was Moses
[55:24] going up seeing the scene dddd
[55:30] tabernacle of God and God had told him
[55:32] when you come back to us you build it
[55:34] exactly like you saw in heaven and
[55:36] brother brems said there's a type on a
[55:38] man body soul spirit outer core in a
[55:42] cardboard of horus so for me to change
[55:45] who is the tent where the tent I mean
[55:49] because if our earthly tabernacle our
[55:54] tent will be dissolved we live in a tent
[55:58] let's mark maybe it has other
[56:00] explanations to look down on us don't
[56:03] forget one thing brother system I am a
[56:07] very simple very much you love me but
[56:12] you have to understand I live in a
[56:13] German tent for 70 80 years but if this
[56:17] change will be resolved you would see
[56:18] who Marcos was really can't say Amen so
[56:23] he can have different different
[56:26] explanations about this but for me it's
[56:28] not literate symbolic like brother Brent
[56:31] said the bride is the heavenly New
[56:34] Jerusalem is the New Jerusalem that's
[56:37] the P the name of the Lord so what
[56:39] happens is this people went into this
[56:43] change as a symbol and they came out
[56:47] heel
[56:48] without knowing how it happened that was
[56:53] the vision of brother Brennan I mean I
[56:57] went there and the woman said what's
[56:59] happened she said I just don't know I
[57:00] couldn't tell what happened she said
[57:02] I've been paralyzed I feel I never was
[57:04] sick and so and so on I don't know what
[57:07] happened now you understand that people
[57:11] got healed without knowing how they got
[57:15] healed that means it is not the old
[57:19] system of let's make the prayer line and
[57:21] let's put hands because these people
[57:23] would have known brother so-and-so came
[57:25] and when he laid his hand I was healed
[57:27] they said I just came to church or
[57:30] whatever and I would see I don't know
[57:33] how do you understand that God is not
[57:36] working in a supernatural way without
[57:39] making some kind like a platform
[57:41] demonstration brother if you want to
[57:44] have something from God you don't have
[57:45] to travel to any convention to any
[57:47] discipline you come just and stay on
[57:49] your post of duty and your father's
[57:52] rewards you they say men that's to be I
[57:57] am a churchgoer absolute churchgoer but
[58:01] when church I'm always going but I have
[58:04] to realize that all the manifestation of
[58:07] the third put were outside of a church
[58:09] God shows I'm not only in the church
[58:12] here I go with the wait where you are if
[58:14] you go hunting and your attitude is
[58:16] right I can heal you there
[58:19] you say Amen let's be the name whatever
[58:22] but there might be other identification
[58:24] let's a bit but it went away from the
[58:29] principle of the man of the hour to
[58:33] understand the god of the hour is there
[58:36] they say Amen I mean next one please
[58:40] I mean therefore I mean when that
[58:45] picture was taken the Bible says but
[58:49] unto you that fear my name shall the Sun
[58:51] of righteousness now you have to
[58:54] understand one thing there brother
[58:56] Branham was a star
[58:58] and a star shines in the night that is
[59:02] loud this year and we are still living
[59:05] in loud this year because mr. Trump is
[59:07] not the owner it is not in the
[59:10] millennium he's not be were still living
[59:12] in loud this year but the bride at the
[59:14] same time came over into bride age Haman
[59:18] and brother Branham preaches the message
[59:21] Shalom 1964 good morning church why does
[59:26] he say good morning the night is over
[59:27] and the Prophet said this he said when
[59:31] when when when the Sun goes up the Sun
[59:34] is the king of all lights say Amen we
[59:38] still live in laude 2nd condition but
[59:41] the bride's went over this the bride is
[59:44] in bride age can you say Amen
[59:46] therefore the bride is not miserable
[59:49] it's somebody miserable here but then
[59:52] you should better come into bride age
[59:53] it's somebody a son somebody blind that
[59:57] would be said it's somebody you're naked
[59:59] when the word came down no sir it's a
[1:00:02] special time can you say Amen
[1:00:04] but what goes along when we speak about
[1:00:07] the opening of the words he said miss
[1:00:09] healing under his wings there's a
[1:00:11] healing that God does that was never
[1:00:15] done before the other pulls but it's
[1:00:18] different than we thought we always had
[1:00:20] Pentecostal ideas somebody has to come
[1:00:22] somebody has to lay hands and God said
[1:00:24] look my presence will do many things
[1:00:26] because when the Sun comes up it pulls
[1:00:28] out all the water what you say ok say
[1:00:31] Amen
[1:00:32] so do you today you don't look for the
[1:00:35] man of the hour
[1:00:36] who should we invite to revive the
[1:00:39] church invite the word who should I
[1:00:42] invite to them get here invite the words
[1:00:44] and the healing is going there can you
[1:00:46] say Amen blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:00:49] there's a changing make the next one
[1:00:51] please
[1:00:53] ok right
[1:00:54] I mean finishing that little part about
[1:00:57] this now this is just the same picture
[1:00:59] that we show before but now just let me
[1:01:03] say when those when those seven angels
[1:01:06] came in the form of a pyramid
[1:01:10] in Division the brother brands had in
[1:01:13] sources of time in that vision he said I
[1:01:16] was caught into that constellation I
[1:01:20] mean and he was a movement I mean I mean
[1:01:26] now first brother branham rides it as a
[1:01:29] little gap I mean but there is an
[1:01:33] invisible Union today going on which
[1:01:38] means a heavily bright group and the
[1:01:39] earthly bright because this headstone he
[1:01:42] said is magnetized
[1:01:47] therefore the head was in that it's
[1:01:52] Christ the entire Holy Ghost that's the
[1:01:56] thing that the church was waiting for
[1:01:58] 2,000 years ago that is you in New York
[1:02:02] you in Florida this day this scripture
[1:02:06] is fulfilled what revelation one to
[1:02:08] seven set the prophet what Christ came
[1:02:10] down they say amen amen
[1:02:14] with what healing under his wings so
[1:02:18] somebody came down well REM says Christ
[1:02:20] I mean and somebody's taken up I mean so
[1:02:27] if if if the church is standing here
[1:02:30] somewhere and that cloud comes and takes
[1:02:36] the church in its constellation you
[1:02:39] don't see them anymore
[1:02:40] and you remember that brother brand said
[1:02:42] in the fourth chapter of Revelation the
[1:02:45] church is not be seen anymore
[1:02:47] they say Amen so we think the church is
[1:02:49] raptured taking away yes but there is a
[1:02:53] spiritual application to I just have to
[1:02:57] find just give me a second
[1:02:59] brother update brother wait do you know
[1:03:02] do you know a mrs. Christian parent girl
[1:03:08] well do you know mrs. Christian pairing
[1:03:10] God brother Joe Canada do you do you
[1:03:15] know mrs. Christian parent girl so the
[1:03:19] FBI is here give that woman out pairing
[1:03:23] uh Christine
[1:03:24] Harrigan if not we take you to the
[1:03:26] sheriff will arrest you
[1:03:27] you say honestly brother friends is
[1:03:30] there's no Christine but do you know it
[1:03:32] Christine
[1:03:33] Oh Diego by marriage she changed her her
[1:03:42] identification Christine Paran God
[1:03:46] doesn't exist anymore but the person is
[1:03:48] still there she's there and not there
[1:03:52] you see she's there and not there when I
[1:03:57] was a young boy I made all the nonsense
[1:03:59] that you can do in the world I was in
[1:04:00] the French Foreign Legion I mean those
[1:04:02] still soldiers you know how the French
[1:04:05] Foreign Legion works you go in as a
[1:04:07] criminal I wasn't a criminal but I went
[1:04:09] in I was a sinner but not a criminal but
[1:04:11] I went in and when you come to the
[1:04:15] French Foreign Legion you just get a
[1:04:17] number and when you come out of five
[1:04:19] years you get a complete new passport I
[1:04:23] mean you were never born I was born in
[1:04:26] Germany your old passport does not exist
[1:04:28] but you are born you get a passport this
[1:04:30] is Mark not Marcus Becker but Marcus
[1:04:33] Marcus
[1:04:35] so Levon born in Paris you get a
[1:04:39] complete new identity so I'm there the
[1:04:42] police comes is here Marcus Becker
[1:04:45] listen is no Marcus Pakistani but I
[1:04:49] changed my identity the church cannot be
[1:04:52] seen anymore why how do you make it but
[1:04:56] changing your name how do you change the
[1:04:59] name by marriage
[1:05:00] the invisible union of priceless work
[1:05:04] amen yes
[1:05:07] therefore brother Graham said one thing
[1:05:09] is sure and that's the thing therefore
[1:05:11] he came down to reveal our true identity
[1:05:15] therefore we're not Baptist anymore
[1:05:16] therefore we're not saying I'm I am in
[1:05:19] the message that's fine but that's not
[1:05:21] our identity no but we're in Christ look
[1:05:25] here is that that Rahab and when
[1:05:29] those two brother Brahim said they were
[1:05:31] tube che boys when they're coming in
[1:05:35] she made a covenant first brother and
[1:05:41] said she protected the message and the
[1:05:45] message later saved the household of her
[1:05:48] afraid 40 is there alien spies it was
[1:05:52] what afar Israel army it was not
[1:05:54] difficult to find out who the house of
[1:05:56] rape because it was at the outside wall
[1:06:00] and when all the walls crumbled one
[1:06:03] house was still standing and said that's
[1:06:05] rehab that was not difficult to find but
[1:06:10] there is a mystery behind that story
[1:06:12] says brother Branham because Ray had
[1:06:14] married Solomon the great American
[1:06:18] general Israeli general and both went to
[1:06:22] Bethlehem to to build objets city
[1:06:24] Bethlehem now from the moment on that
[1:06:27] salman married Rahab she was not Rahab
[1:06:31] anymore she was miss salmon and when she
[1:06:37] entered tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu Bethlem and
[1:06:41] somebody would have asked where is the
[1:06:43] horror 1/2 who standing right before
[1:06:46] them and not she's changed her identity
[1:06:49] I'm not oh I'm I'm miss Simon do you
[1:06:54] understand the church is not be seen
[1:06:56] anymore
[1:06:57] it has a double meaning blessed be the
[1:07:00] name of the Lord therefore he came down
[1:07:02] therefore he's our identity therefore we
[1:07:06] have two names
[1:07:07] I mean therefore we are Esther therefore
[1:07:11] Esther had two names one was the Israeli
[1:07:13] name that
[1:07:14] ester star and one was her original name
[1:07:17] that means Hadassah which means bride or
[1:07:22] merchant therefore we have we have an
[1:07:26] let me say we have a human life I I ask
[1:07:30] you who are you he said I'm Fritz Miller
[1:07:33] born in Connecticut and then he said but
[1:07:37] I'm more than this I was there when joke
[1:07:41] comin when they all shouted for joy I
[1:07:46] was already in the mind of wrong
[1:07:48] you understand that our begin was not in
[1:07:51] America it was long before the
[1:07:53] foundation of the world and all those
[1:07:55] who were him they will come back we are
[1:07:57] just in a little Passat we're just
[1:07:59] building for some years and God came
[1:08:02] down and opened and revealed our
[1:08:04] identity who we are for us the rapture
[1:08:08] is the most normal thing like going to
[1:08:12] church because you are the rapture is
[1:08:14] not the rapture hey my father paid for
[1:08:19] me at the cross at Calvary and my father
[1:08:22] takes me home and he came to unite
[1:08:25] himself with me in spirit form in Word
[1:08:28] form and I go forward can you say Amen
[1:08:31] there is a day like there's never been a
[1:08:34] day like this day before now let me just
[1:08:37] read and we're stopping this first okay
[1:08:40] sorry for this but I need this it I need
[1:08:43] can you say Amen so far now I showed you
[1:08:48] why God has to come down because we can
[1:08:54] do our efforts as good as we can but we
[1:08:59] come to our end and whenever children of
[1:09:04] God came to the end God came down
[1:09:07] personally that's his nature that's the
[1:09:12] way how we understand the Bible the
[1:09:14] Bible became through the opening of the
[1:09:15] cell a new book now we understand how
[1:09:19] our Father is who he is and how he
[1:09:23] thinks now God
[1:09:26] came down to become men God never sits
[1:09:33] on his throne and said okay you do know
[1:09:36] your business we will see who makes the
[1:09:37] rapture God comes down I love that
[1:09:41] little illustration a little boy goes
[1:09:45] into a shop and he wants to buy some
[1:09:47] dogs and the owner comes down the
[1:09:52] staircase he said and the boy said I
[1:09:54] want to have this dog and the owner says
[1:09:56] why do you want to have this dog I mean
[1:09:58] he's handicapped he cannot walk he
[1:10:00] doesn't have a value why don't you take
[1:10:02] a real good one and the boy is rolling
[1:10:05] up his his his trousers and from his
[1:10:10] knee on he has an artificial leg and the
[1:10:13] boy said I want to have this dog because
[1:10:15] when we go out he understands me and I
[1:10:17] understand him and brother BAM said this
[1:10:21] God became man to understand man and
[1:10:25] then brother brems says and that is our
[1:10:27] Father God became teenager to understand
[1:10:31] the teenager and then he even says this
[1:10:34] God became man as man you understand the
[1:10:38] mixed audience okay
[1:10:39] God became man to understand man because
[1:10:42] when David felt was that woman God must
[1:10:45] have said David I mean how can you
[1:10:48] fought with that don't you know what I
[1:10:50] gave to you but when God became man he
[1:10:54] knew what hormones are there for a woman
[1:11:00] comes to brother Brahim said and she's
[1:11:03] so torn up my brother and said
[1:11:04] everything is with you wrong and
[1:11:05] everything is right you are just in your
[1:11:07] menopause not more we still live in that
[1:11:10] body and God understands that God became
[1:11:13] teenager to understand the teenagers God
[1:11:16] came personally down every evening in
[1:11:21] the Garden of Eden that's our father
[1:11:24] brother our father had a lot of things
[1:11:27] to do a lot of because I mean all these
[1:11:31] theophany policy all these seraphim's
[1:11:34] all these Shara beams to take care of
[1:11:38] it's quite something
[1:11:39] and then to put in action all these all
[1:11:42] these universe every star I mean that's
[1:11:46] something to do but every evening God
[1:11:49] came down because his children weren't
[1:11:51] Eden and brother if we understand how
[1:11:54] God was we take care of our children
[1:11:57] you can have your hobby you can have
[1:11:59] your fishing whatever but never put
[1:12:01] family second first God and then you
[1:12:04] choose the family can't say Amen
[1:12:07] don't put him just before the screen and
[1:12:10] said okay let him entertain themselves
[1:12:11] they don't need a screen any deli and
[1:12:14] then in mama to take care of them to
[1:12:17] pray with them God was an example for us
[1:12:20] God came down every evening God came
[1:12:24] down personally to destroy the Tower of
[1:12:26] Babel God came down personally to shut
[1:12:32] the door in Noah's Ark so I came down in
[1:12:37] a shut the door God came down personally
[1:12:41] to protect the wife of Abraham when
[1:12:46] Abraham was lying to to the Pharaoh and
[1:12:49] brother and said he put already on his
[1:12:51] pajama he would think about this nice
[1:12:52] little girl and God said look I have to
[1:12:55] protect and he comes down a speaks to me
[1:12:59] said look my friend you're a good as a
[1:13:01] dead man I mean you can imagine his
[1:13:03] feelings change a little bit he he he
[1:13:05] can't a little bit down from his
[1:13:07] feelings that Pharaoh brother BAM said
[1:13:10] this God had to protect her because she
[1:13:13] was the wife of a prophet that's to be
[1:13:16] the name of the Lord God came personally
[1:13:18] down to visit Abraham and gave him his
[1:13:22] personal promise I mean God came down
[1:13:27] personally to wrestle with Jacob and
[1:13:30] gave him his new identity I mean you're
[1:13:33] not Jacob you're living in America born
[1:13:35] in Connecticut you're this honest I know

[1:13:52] briskly down to meet Moses and gave him
[1:13:55] his commission he says I came down and I
[1:13:58] sent you brother BAM said this whenever
[1:14:03] it's important for God he comes
[1:14:05] personally that's our Father
[1:14:08] that's all he doesn't send someone there
[1:14:11] for brother Branham says this and he
[1:14:13] speaks about God you have to understand
[1:14:15] this he said he was the fire brigade of

[1:14:19] a some kind like a fire and the fire

[1:14:28] on and then they're hurting ding ding
[1:14:29] ding ding ding ding and here comes the
[1:14:31] fire brigade for Louisville and the
[1:14:33] captain was standing on the ladder and
[1:14:35] the ladder goes into the fire and the
[1:14:36] man said man behind me come behind me
[1:14:39] and brother brems in five minutes
[1:14:41] everything was finished because he was
[1:14:43] somebody taking initiative God's came
[1:14:47] personally down to open the Red Sea look
[1:14:52] Israel did their part but when they were
[1:14:57] standing at the Red Sea they knew one
[1:15:00] thing we can dance we can shout we can
[1:15:05] praise we can exorcise us into some
[1:15:10] emotionalism but at the end of the day
[1:15:13] when God doesn't come down and makes the
[1:15:16] miracle we're standing here and God says
[1:15:19] why are you crying
[1:15:21] big man and brother mem said the angels
[1:15:24] were just around Moses just waiting for
[1:15:26] him to speak
[1:15:27] that's our Father Casey amen
[1:15:30] God came personally down to meet Joshua
[1:15:34] God came personally down to Gideon and
[1:15:38] gave him his commission I mean gives you
[1:15:42] under Howard I mean he was as a coward
[1:15:45] and God says Gideon mighty man who makes
[1:15:50] the rapture if you would see
[1:15:56] God says mighty man who makes the
[1:15:59] rapture God says look I mean rising of
[1:16:05] the Sun quickening power brought me
[1:16:11] behind the curtain of time and I saw all
[1:16:13] of you there and he says all of them

[1:16:16] there God sees the bride in the rapture
[1:16:19] already God says I've called you bro but
[1:16:24] you know if I if you would know how I
[1:16:26] feel God's I'm not used to how you feel
[1:16:27] I see you're ready because you have a
[1:16:30] representation will I make it God says
[1:16:35] hey I know you make it because you're my
[1:16:37] child hey man do you understand that we
[1:16:42] rest on God raptures that we have to
[1:16:44] work as into something into no no no my
[1:16:47] father will pick me up my father will
[1:16:49] not forget me here can you say Amen God
[1:16:52] came personally down to wake up Samuel
[1:16:56] God came personally to David to direct a
[1:17:01] stone I mean and I make it just as a
[1:17:04] little now he was David with his effort
[1:17:08] do whatever you can to serve the Lord do
[1:17:10] your part
[1:17:11] but no it will not be enough I mean no
[1:17:16] that is not enough and then here comes a
[1:17:18] stone he comes David yeah and brother
[1:17:22] brems said this when the stone left the
[1:17:23] hand of David God took that stone in his
[1:17:27] hands and on that stone was an address
[1:17:31] front of David of Goliath so Goliath
[1:17:35] could have made this or this or that
[1:17:37] stone would have said look I have a
[1:17:39] destiny friends wherever you hide I find
[1:17:42] you
[1:17:43] they say men if you do your part brother
[1:17:48] brain said God will send the same angel
[1:17:50] suit that he sent to Elijah
[1:17:52] that's our Father he's not sitting just
[1:17:55] and said we will see who will make it
[1:17:59] that's not our Father you do your part
[1:18:03] your father okay I help you can you say
[1:18:05] Amen
[1:18:06] what a wonderful father we have God came
[1:18:09] down personally to his rearing prophet
[1:18:12] Elijah God came personally that down to
[1:18:16] identify job job dead dead dead poor man
[1:18:22] and here come here come the fourth man
[1:18:24] after three friends I mean the first one
[1:18:28] was a Lutheran the second one was a
[1:18:29] Methodist the third one was a
[1:18:31] Pentecostal make sure what you did is a
[1:18:33] prayer line man and some gifts man
[1:18:37] that's fine we love these things but
[1:18:39] they are not the answer to our question
[1:18:41] job you need it you know it has to
[1:18:43] shiver that we have these things enough
[1:18:44] that's fine but that's not our answer
[1:18:46] right I'm a we need more we need
[1:18:48] identity from God and here comes early
[1:18:51] who and he speaks about job look you
[1:18:53] have only 78 years to live and when you
[1:18:56] die there is already a body waiting
[1:18:58] because you will get your used again and
[1:19:00] job stands up and says I know that my
[1:19:02] Redeemer liveth and right from the
[1:19:05] whirlwind says job stop being a
[1:19:10] Pentecostal baby because I want to speak
[1:19:13] supernatural to you stop being
[1:19:16] kindergarten stand before me like a man
[1:19:19] because God will not marry a child God
[1:19:23] will not marry a baby
[1:19:25] God will marry a woman exactly so Christ
[1:19:28] will marry a true bride and God says man
[1:19:31] stand up here's joke and he asked him
[1:19:34] just a question job I want to ask you
[1:19:36] ask you one thing where were you and job
[1:19:40] must have said Oh God I was just
[1:19:44] thinking about that little life in here
[1:19:47] in Georgia and I was seeing a little
[1:19:48] problems in this and Jason and problems
[1:19:51] with my I kind of paid the bill that
[1:19:52] kind of this and God said to him my job
[1:19:55] where were you and job must have
[1:19:57] but I was in you can you say Amen do you
[1:20:02] know one thing if we speak about
[1:20:03] spiritual amnesia you can only have
[1:20:06] amnesia when you had knowledge before if
[1:20:10] not you have nada Misha you have had the
[1:20:13] knowledge who you were before but
[1:20:15] amnesia put it out and here comes God
[1:20:18] though I said I would take that amnesia
[1:20:19] from you I mean therefore we believe the
[1:20:24] third Pole because in the mind of God we
[1:20:27] were with him when he was creating we
[1:20:30] saw him doing the things therefore it's
[1:20:31] not a problem for us created creating
[1:20:33] squirrels for God is nothing you see man
[1:20:36] do you know one thing how it's so
[1:20:39] important to understand the voice in the
[1:20:40] voice they find out that the last sense
[1:20:43] that we have is the hearing when when a
[1:20:46] person dies and when a person's in coma
[1:20:50] and the person likes a special singer
[1:20:52] and you put the music of that singer on
[1:20:54] that person because sometimes comes back
[1:20:56] to life because that voice Michael
[1:21:00] Jackson would have pulled him up so so I
[1:21:04] told the church one thing is sure if I
[1:21:07] will fall into a coma you know what you
[1:21:09] put on my ears okay and if I hear good
[1:21:13] evening friends
[1:21:14] [Applause]
[1:21:16] now this room essage remembers us about
[1:21:20] things that we knew before but we
[1:21:22] wouldn't we forgot them because we're
[1:21:24] still in that body therefore when we
[1:21:26] preach we don't preach here we preach
[1:21:28] here can you say Amen
[1:21:31] blessed be and the more God is involved
[1:21:34] and folding himself the more we remember
[1:21:36] our self therefore for us the rapture is
[1:21:38] just I mean I wasn't him
[1:21:40] that is a logical thing that I would go
[1:21:42] interruption not in that thing of okay
[1:21:45] let's drink and that smoke that is not a
[1:21:47] son of God but if you do your best from
[1:21:50] that point and God takes you up can you
[1:21:52] say Amen God comes personally in the
[1:21:55] fiery furnace of Babylon God comes
[1:21:58] firstly to me to have to marry for her
[1:22:00] pregnant God comes down in the form of
[1:22:03] men and in Christ Jesus God comes
[1:22:06] personally to Paul on the way to
[1:22:08] Damascus God comes personally to open
[1:22:12] the prison of Paul and Barnabas God
[1:22:15] comes first into brother Brian give him
[1:22:16] his commission God comes personally to
[1:22:19] the Ohio River God comes personally to
[1:22:23] Houston Texas
[1:22:24] to make a picture and we say oh that's
[1:22:27] brother branham was the pillar of fire
[1:22:29] brother brems said God wanted to make a
[1:22:32] picture of himself and he allowed that I
[1:22:35] was on the picture too so for us it's
[1:22:40] more difficult to be an unbeliever than
[1:22:42] to be a believer I mean for us not to
[1:22:45] believe that because we have even the
[1:22:48] photos can you say Amen God came
[1:22:51] personally on Sunset Mountain that the
[1:22:54] bridegroom will meet his bride Christ
[1:22:57] the word God comes down to take his
[1:22:59] bride I mean and God comes personally to
[1:23:02] Israel to reveal himself I mean can you
[1:23:06] say Amen now brother Brian makes the
[1:23:08] scenery and he says it like this
[1:23:12] whenever deal it deals with God's
[1:23:16] children
[1:23:17] God is not sending someone it's too
[1:23:20] important from it's his children
[1:23:22] I mean therefore he did not send body
[1:23:25] else at the cross and say okay you die
[1:23:26] for because it was his children
[1:23:28] I die for my children and the Prophet
[1:23:32] said this now when when when when and I
[1:23:35] could read it but but just let me say it
[1:23:36] in my word he said when the three
[1:23:39] youngsters were in that fiery furnace
[1:23:41] and baby lon
[1:23:42] he's in Babylon he said the angels came
[1:23:44] and said let me go down and one of the
[1:23:47] angel I will wash everything away and
[1:23:49] then God says no one word you was you
[1:23:51] was a mighty angel that's just wonderful
[1:23:54] but he said I saw this youngster
[1:23:57] spraying last night and I heard the cry
[1:24:02] and then both of em said this what God
[1:24:06] says he said this is a man-sized job and
[1:24:11] then God says I have to go down myself
[1:24:17] who was the first one was it Dan no that
[1:24:20] was Christ can you see him whenever it's
[1:24:24] important for God he comes personally so
[1:24:28] I showed you through all the scripture
[1:24:30] what happens in our day God is not just
[1:24:33] sitting here said okay mmm here in
[1:24:35] Georgia we would see who it makes it God
[1:24:37] knows already say okay I'll help you
[1:24:40] okay you do your Papa to help you
[1:24:42] there's a certain moment where I take
[1:24:43] you just under my arms okay I send you a
[1:24:45] fair chariot of fire okay um do we
[1:24:49] believe that I mean just just mix it
[1:24:51] Nate I come to the end I mean therefore
[1:24:53] I told you next one
[1:24:56] that's one last one yeah therefore I
[1:24:59] told you I hope that everything that I
[1:25:01] said look you understand that it was a
[1:25:03] little bit pressed if all the balance
[1:25:06] was a little bit out you understand it
[1:25:07] was I was speaking about a subject okay
[1:25:12] but let's be a Thanksgiving to remember
[1:25:17] our Father you say hey if I had ten
[1:25:20] thousand lives I would serve the Lord
[1:25:22] brother Marcus what is your doctrine as
[1:25:25] for me and by heart
[1:25:27] we serve the rose it's a love affair
[1:25:31] now this is this is a picture very very
[1:25:35] touchy this man is not the grandfather
[1:25:40] this man is the father of that girl
[1:25:42] it's an unbeliever but the man has
[1:25:46] cancer that means he has not long to
[1:25:50] live and he knows one thing nobody in
[1:25:55] the life of my daughter will replace
[1:25:57] daddy do you know as a mother as a
[1:26:00] father nobody takes your place do you
[1:26:03] know that God placed our children
[1:26:05] willfully in our family if you are
[1:26:09] failing just nobody would take take your
[1:26:11] place I mean so we should be prayed up
[1:26:14] Lord let me be the best father best mama
[1:26:16] in the world absolutely so I mean this
[1:26:19] man understood a lesson that we have to
[1:26:21] understand some time this was her father
[1:26:24] having cancer having very short to live
[1:26:26] and he knows one thing I will never be
[1:26:28] able to bring my daughter to the altar
[1:26:30] when she buries so what they were doing
[1:26:33] as she is maybe 12 years old she had no
[1:26:36] husband that's for sure but they were
[1:26:38] doing as if there is a marriage and he
[1:26:41] was just taking that girl to the altar
[1:26:44] and when she will marry one day they
[1:26:47] will continue that ceremony
[1:26:48] from that moment on and she will be able
[1:26:52] to say my own father brought me to the
[1:26:56] altar if a natural father can be like
[1:27:04] this what about our Father
[1:27:06] what about our if we would know how he
[1:27:09] thinks about us and how he cares brother
[1:27:12] Brahim says it like this
[1:27:13] he said when when his great meetings 1st
[1:27:15] 2nd poof and they were over the young
[1:27:17] that these these disciples were just on
[1:27:20] a boat testimony on the sea they were
[1:27:23] just they became dark and brother brems
[1:27:25] and the bible says jesus went up on a
[1:27:27] mountain and brother bam said he was
[1:27:31] observing them all the time and when the
[1:27:34] night was there in the midst of laude
[1:27:37] seer he came down personally
[1:27:40] what a time that we live our time exact
[1:27:44] he came down personally a man who who
[1:27:49] wants to go back to a former age it's no
[1:27:52] way no way no there has never been a day
[1:27:55] like this day before God always comes in
[1:27:59] our direction therefore brother bream
[1:28:02] said when Abram came from the slaughter
[1:28:05] Melchizedek came to him one came from
[1:28:08] there
[1:28:09] McKenzie came from the coming when
[1:28:12] Rebecca was on the camels coming to
[1:28:14] Isaac Isaac came halfway to Rebekah to
[1:28:18] meet her in the evening time when the
[1:28:21] prodigal son came back to the Father the
[1:28:24] Bible says the father was running to him
[1:28:27] he was not saying mom that's not our

[1:30:22] understand what I want to say and we
[1:30:24] have a father who wants to let us know
[1:30:26] hey my time is your time I mean you want
[1:30:29] to pray I'm there how much time that God
[1:30:33] was the pillar of fire we'll be in our
[1:30:35] sleeping place and we said and we asked
[1:30:38] where is God and nothing happens nothing
[1:30:40] happens brother there is right now the
[1:30:42] greatest revival ever going on because
[1:30:48] the Prophet said the revival is over the
[1:30:51] Pentecostal revivals over they live on
[1:30:53] the ashes of that even the message that
[1:30:55] if on the ashes of it but the bride
[1:30:57] didn't have a revival yet it's a
[1:31:00] complete different form of a revival
[1:31:03] it's different what a time if you miss
[1:31:06] this that still small voice you miss the
[1:31:09] message you just have God send a prophet
[1:31:12] that's not enough
[1:31:14] recognizing the day and smash is more
[1:31:16] than to understand God sent the Prophet
[1:31:17] many people saw God send the prophet but
[1:31:19] he is here therefore God's wish to
[1:31:21] brother Graham in the in that vision he
[1:31:24] said why don't you walk with me and said
[1:31:27] that would be the greatest privilege God
[1:31:28] asked you why do you walk Oh
[1:31:31] for me is enough go to church and then
[1:31:32] you lived my life you know you know you
[1:31:34] know I'm a hockey fan that's all fine
[1:31:35] but God ask you why don't you walk with
[1:31:37] me you say man how how how the bride the
[1:31:45] rapture is already going on not the body
[1:31:48] change sure no but we do you feel how we
[1:31:51] how we how we get away from the things
[1:31:54] of the world do we feel it we are
[1:31:56] already in college raptured condition
[1:31:59] that's how about the brand called but
[1:32:00] is already something that God that that
[1:32:02] we're leaving the things more slowly by
[1:32:05] slowly I mean and that we are
[1:32:08] transformed already in that we are
[1:32:09] thinking more about heavenly things than
[1:32:11] about earthly things he meant it's
[1:32:13] already going on that thing that'll be
[1:32:16] the name of the Lord
[1:32:17] hardly if the musicians would come
[1:32:20] hallelujah I mean do you have the song I
[1:32:25] have a father I have a father do you
[1:32:31] know her yeah III have he knows money
[1:32:46] but if you can you can you play it now
[1:32:51] if you don't have it and let us sing
[1:32:53] let's do it like this do you play softly
[1:32:56] the song that you were playing as the
[1:32:58] last song when I when I came up yeah
[1:33:03] open the eyes of Marr just softly in our
[1:33:04] because I have two little testimonies to
[1:33:06] give and then and then a very small but
[1:33:10] very sure don't don't fear can you say
[1:33:19] Amen so far do you really see Stacey
[1:33:21] that let have that just have a have a
[1:33:24] little time to think about our Father
[1:33:27] you see that these little stories there
[1:33:30] brother Brandon tells there were not to
[1:33:33] be just a little bit emotional but the
[1:33:36] whole message even this little stories
[1:33:38] they they should show the heart of God
[1:33:41] God says hey children that's the way I
[1:33:44] am
[1:33:44] do you understand
[1:33:46] Martin Luther they were always they
[1:33:51] brought a picture of God always fighting
[1:33:54] after fight was this enough to fight
[1:33:55] with that and you know but God says hey
[1:33:57] I'm a father
[1:33:58] I understand and here's that older man
[1:34:01] and brother man said in the message God
[1:34:03] gifts find always their places and the
[1:34:06] father had that dog and it seems that
[1:34:09] the little girl died already but he
[1:34:11] promised her that dog for Christmas you
[1:34:14] see and he just went into the into the
[1:34:16] dark and the policeman said you are
[1:34:18] going to die if you continue that way
[1:34:21] and the father said about a promise to
[1:34:23] my girl to give her that dog no matter
[1:34:29] the price that it will cost for God no
[1:34:32] matter the price God remembers he's a
[1:34:35] father
[1:34:37] don't forget your children who are not
[1:34:39] serving the Lord right now you say
[1:34:40] brother Marcos these children they bring
[1:34:43] reproach on the family look my life
[1:34:45] brought a lot of reproach on God's
[1:34:47] family but my father was never ashamed
[1:34:49] of me because he paid the price on
[1:34:52] Calvary right before I was born
[1:34:54] my father always said to all the Angels
[1:34:56] look this is Marcos he brings a lot of
[1:34:58] reproach but once I call him you will
[1:35:00] see what it will be I mean and there is
[1:35:05] a true story that's really end to
[1:35:09] understand what human love can do and
[1:35:11] now you bring it multiplied with a
[1:35:14] thousand there was an earthquake in
[1:35:18] Armenia at the beginning of this century
[1:35:21] wisdom a true story a true witness
[1:35:25] Anna Anna Anna school collapsed and the
[1:35:30] Red Cross they stopped to search because
[1:35:33] there was no hope to find the children
[1:35:36] but one father was starting to shovel
[1:35:40] with this with his hands for 16 or 18
[1:35:45] hours and some helped him because they
[1:35:48] thought this father has become crazy and
[1:35:51] after 16 and 17 hours they came into a
[1:35:55] place of protection right under the
[1:35:57] building where these youngsters were
[1:35:59] still in and the testimony of those who
[1:36:04] survived was that the boy of that father
[1:36:08] who was beginning to shovel had he had a
[1:36:12] testimony he said my father will not let
[1:36:16] me hear me he said whatever that will
[1:36:19] cost him my father takes me out and I
[1:36:22] tell you there was a supernatural
[1:36:24] connection between these between the
[1:36:26] confession of that boy and the father
[1:36:29] and without knowing what he does he was
[1:36:32] just starting
[1:36:35] that's our Father and brother I tell you
[1:36:38] one thing sister this world becomes
[1:36:40] crazy but our father says I will not let
[1:36:44] you here our Father comes down because
[1:36:49] in all history when it became difficult
[1:36:52] for sure he said I come down personally
[1:36:55] so the rapture is not that God says okay
[1:36:58] we will we will we would see our father
[1:37:01] said look you do your part but when your
[1:37:05] wisdom is said when you are at the end
[1:37:07] of everything know one thing I pick you
[1:37:10] up there I have a father you have a

[1:42:39] about our Father because he is our
[1:42:45] Father
[1:42:51] not to this to be the father of a human
[1:42:53] flesh no he's a father of a kingdom of
[1:42:57] kings and priests diseases like I've
[1:43:02] always said about David you think about
[1:43:04] David could go out there and just kill a
[1:43:07] giant and burner and the line what if
[1:43:11] he'd had the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:43:13] he took the line the bar and the giant
[1:43:17] and put them all together tied one hand
[1:43:19] behind him and said come on we're gonna
[1:43:22] solve this right now why because it
[1:43:25] would've been so great and that's what
[1:43:27] the kingdom of God is a born-again
[1:43:28] believer we truly have a great father
[1:43:32] man amen tell her brother how much you
[1:43:34] appreciate him appreciate him coming by
[1:43:36] visiting with us and having a good time
[1:43:38] with us and if you have anything you'd
[1:43:40] like to give to him we take care of the
[1:43:42] offers and all but if you have anything
[1:43:43] you'd like to give to employed for
[1:43:45] really did give it to Nolan and all I
[1:43:47] said he wouldn't ask for nothing because
[1:43:49] he tried her best to give me the money
[1:43:50] back because he says he worked for a
[1:43:52] living I like that you know what I like
[1:43:56] that I never did get to know my father
[1:44:00] he died when I was about four years over
[1:44:02] but I don't know whether he was lazy or
[1:44:06] not but I just don't think being a
[1:44:11] Christian makes it right for us to be
[1:44:13] lazy I think it puts us to where we
[1:44:16] ought to be on fire for him and going
[1:44:19] for him all the time having a good time
[1:44:23] in the Lord amen
[1:44:24] I thought all mines clear just remember
