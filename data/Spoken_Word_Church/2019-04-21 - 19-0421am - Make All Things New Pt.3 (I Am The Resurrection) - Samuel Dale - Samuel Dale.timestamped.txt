[7:49] it's but anyhow just remember this
[7:52] revelation 21 and we'll go to John 11
[7:55] and get right into our thought Oh

[9:13] that will be taken care of you know all
[9:15] of you gone to remember that remember
[9:17] brother al he's having a lot of problems
[9:20] so brethren Lord would bless with him
[9:23] okay all right revelations that we're
[9:26] still on the point it's going to be hard
[9:29] to try to connect it to the resurrection
[9:31] but we're on the point of all things new
[9:35] and maybe we can get it together into a
[9:39] point at the end of the message but he
[9:43] says in Revelation 21:1
[9:45] and I saw a new heaven and a new earth
[9:47] for the first heaven and the first Earth
[9:50] were passed away there was no more seat
[9:52] and I John saw the holy city New
[9:54] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[9:57] heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[9:59] her husband and I heard a great voice
[10:02] out of heaven saying behold the
[10:05] tabernacle of God is with men and he
[10:07] will dwell with them and they shall be
[10:09] his people and God himself shall be with
[10:12] them and be their God God shall wipe
[10:14] away all tears from their eyes there
[10:17] shall be no more death neither sorrow
[10:19] nor crying neither shall there be any
[10:22] more pain for the former things are
[10:25] passed away and he said and he that set
[10:28] up on the throne said behold behold I
[10:32] make all things new and he said write
[10:35] for these words are true and faithful
[10:38] he said unto me it is done I'm Alpha and
[10:42] Omega the beginning and the end I will
[10:44] give unto him that is athirst of the
[10:46] fountain of the water of life freely
[10:49] he that overcometh shall inherit all
[10:51] things and I will be his son and he
[10:54] shall be I will be his God and he shall
[10:56] be my son you may be seated the Lord at
[10:59] his blessing to the reading of the word
[11:01] I said it's going to be a when odd
[11:04] connection to try to bring because
[11:08] remember we've been talking about I'll
[11:12] make all things new all right now we're
[11:17] going to see if we can tie that in with
[11:19] a point of this time of the year of the
[11:23] resurrection because today we honor the
[11:27] resurrection of our Lord and Savior
[11:29] Jesus Christ and believing that he will
[11:33] make all things possible unto us and you
[11:37] know we'll we'll be at that point but I
[11:40] want you to think now for a little bit
[11:43] with me of here where we're in John to
[11:49] read this and then just think about it
[11:55] see if you see if you can pull it
[11:58] together with with the right point you
[12:01] know okay let's go to John 11 verse 20
[12:12] then Martha as soon as she heard that
[12:15] Jesus was coming when it met him but
[12:18] Mary said still in the house then said
[12:22] Martha unto Jesus if thou had us been
[12:25] here my brother had not died now listen
[12:31] to this statement but I know that even
[12:36] now whatsoever that's wilt ask of God
[12:39] God will give it thee now don't forget
[12:44] that don't forget that thought because
[12:47] it'll be the main point of our message
[12:48] when we get to it because look what
[12:53] Jesus turning spoke to her jesus saith
[12:55] unto her thy brother shall live again
[13:00] now they believed in a resurrection you
[13:03] had your Pharisees and Sadducees
[13:05] and you'll even hear brother Branham
[13:07] mention that you know like the Sadducees
[13:10] one of them believed in the resurrection
[13:11] another one didn't maybe you've heard
[13:13] that down through time of what's been
[13:16] doing but just remember it's it's not
[13:19] saying it the way we think it's saying
[13:21] it because you know the Sadducees they
[13:25] believed in the resurrection but not in
[13:29] the resurrection like the Pharisees
[13:31] bleed see one was looking more ice to a
[13:35] resurrection the other was just looking
[13:38] well it'll be over with gone will do and
[13:40] whatever or one of these days were going
[13:43] because don't think that the Sadducees
[13:44] thought death ended every time why would
[13:48] you want to be in any form of
[13:49] Christianity or serve God if you didn't
[13:51] have a place to go to when you die are
[13:55] you listening don't know don't think
[13:57] that they were sad because they didn't
[13:58] have no resurrection they believed the
[14:02] old man kind of always believed joke you
[14:04] know he said I know that my redeemer see
[14:09] everybody has believed in a resurrection
[14:11] but it's according to how you believe it
[14:15] well now that's the thought today how do
[14:19] you believe the resurrection
[14:24] you know how do how are you connected to
[14:27] it so think about it now jesus saith
[14:30] unto her thy brother shall live again
[14:35] see know what she believed in the
[14:37] resurrection because she said Martha
[14:39] saith unto him I know that he shall rise
[14:42] again in the resurrection at the last
[14:46] day as she believed in a resurrection
[14:50] right
[14:53] she believed they would be a
[14:55] resurrection because basically man
[14:58] believed that all right but what's the
[15:01] answer and jesus saith unto her I am the
[15:06] resurrection and the life he that
[15:09] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[15:13] shall he live and whosoever liveth and
[15:15] believeth in me shall never die
[15:18] believe us now this and watch she saith
[15:22] unto Him because now she had already now
[15:26] listened with me she had already
[15:28] declared when Jesus was there and met
[15:33] her she said if you had have been here
[15:39] my brother wouldn't have died she
[15:42] believed that there was enough
[15:44] connection to that right now watch her
[15:48] next statement she said but now I know
[15:53] that even now whatever you ask God
[16:03] whatever you ask God he'll give you
[16:07] because you've seen that over and over
[16:10] and over right so now look at the point
[16:14] you follow me she declares if you'd have
[16:18] been here my brother wouldn't have died
[16:20] she had enough confidence in her
[16:23] thoughts and things of life that she
[16:27] believed that Jesus was something great
[16:30] but did she have it in the correct order
[16:37] no because she says now if you'd have
[16:43] been here he wouldn't have died that's a
[16:46] good statement all right now he's dead
[16:51] well what's he gonna do she said but now
[16:56] I believe - then whatever you ask him
[17:02] whatever you ask God he'll do did she
[17:14] have her thoughts in the right channel
[17:16] do we have our thoughts in the right
[17:18] channel I think with me I said it'll
[17:28] it'll tie together the Lord willing I
[17:30] know that he shall rise again
[17:34] see I thought over her all of her
[17:37] statements were in good State good
[17:39] points she believed in a resurrection at
[17:42] the last days and she believed in okay
[17:46] if you don't raise him then he'll raise
[17:52] in the last day because she believed in
[17:55] the resurrection that's what I'm saying
[17:56] don't think the Sadducees because you'd
[17:59] think that they were sad because they
[18:01] didn't believe it was the way the
[18:03] resurrection was taught among the
[18:05] Pharisees and Sadducees that made the
[18:07] difference between what they were
[18:09] thinking because that's what I'm trying
[18:14] to get you to see marry her Martha she
[18:18] says yes Lord yeah I believe in the
[18:25] resurrection and I believe Lazarus will
[18:28] come up in the resurrection now jesus
[18:35] said unto her I am
[18:41] the resurrection and the life
[18:51] now do you believe in a resurrection
[18:58] do you believe yes we believe there'll
[19:00] be a resurrection yes there's going to
[19:03] be a resurrection but we would we
[19:09] believe him if he was standing here
[19:11] today to say I am the resurrection or
[19:18] would we be believing in a resurrection
[19:25] now get this statement believing in a
[19:29] resurrection is not the all of
[19:32] Christianity
[19:43] now before this incident happened there
[19:47] had been many people raised from the
[19:50] dead right
[19:57] Alijah raised from the dead what about
[20:03] Jesus and the little girl that was and
[20:07] he told him he said she's asleep in hell
[20:09] life because she is dead are you
[20:15] following me is it just to believe that
[20:25] a resurrection is possible or do we
[20:33] really know for sure 'ti who this is is
[20:36] talking because now remember reading
[20:42] scripture
[20:46] she said lord if you'd have been here
[20:54] Lazarus wouldn't have died she kind of
[20:57] had that confidence that faith built
[21:00] that he could contact someone else right
[21:10] she said yeah and said I know what have
[21:15] confidence in the fact of the way it's
[21:17] been around here and what's happened in
[21:19] the deads been raised six been healed
[21:22] the things that has happened in your
[21:24] ministry that even now if you're asking
[21:32] God will come on the same
[21:48] Jesus said to her I am the resurrection
[21:55] what was he saying she was given the
[22:00] point that whatever God would deal with
[22:03] or tell him he'd go do if God told him
[22:06] to go raise Lazarus he'd go raise
[22:07] Lazarus
[22:09] right he said Martha I am the
[22:19] resurrection see they heard him say
[22:27] before Abraham was I am
[22:35] they heard him say I am the bread in the
[22:42] wilderness right but when he says at
[22:52] this time look what he said he said I am
[22:55] the resurrection I am what you have need
[23:01] of you got a brother that's dead you've
[23:08] made some good statements about me but
[23:11] do you realize Who I am you realize that
[23:19] what he wasn't doing at this situation
[23:22] was relating to Martha who he was
[23:33] that he was the God of the Old Testament
[23:41] he was the one that was at the burning
[23:44] bush
[23:51] that Moses said what by what name he
[23:53] said I am that I am we want to make the
[23:59] talk a lot of times about I am as me and
[24:02] I am and all of that but do you realize
[24:12] Martha wasn't talking about that she
[24:21] believed God could do these things
[24:25] because remember that's what she said
[24:30] even now whatever you ask god what a
[24:41] bold statement is going back into the
[24:43] face of a person that is looking for
[24:46] something - oh god some were to try to
[24:49] raise the dead and Jesus could have
[24:54] declares it has not the dead been raised
[24:56] as think the heel has not these things
[24:58] taking place and see what it said yes
[25:06] but what a surprise was when he said I
[25:09] am the resurrection he was declaring
[25:16] himself to be the same god of the
[25:19] burning bush you'll find it in acts 7 I
[25:25] think it is where it says this is that
[25:27] one that was in the bush in the
[25:29] wilderness who who is that one read up
[25:33] and down what you're reading there in
[25:34] the book of life you'll find this the
[25:36] Lord Jesus Christ the Lord Jesus Christ
[25:40] was in that burning bush not as a human
[25:43] element not as a man or 16 element body
[25:46] etc he was there as to be who he was and
[25:57] in Clark
[25:58] I am the resurrection he was declaring
[26:05] himself to her as to be God she was
[26:10] looking for a God her statement showed
[26:14] that we believe even now whatever you
[26:18] ask God whatever you ask God you go talk
[26:27] to God and come back and we believe
[26:29] Lazarus erasing the dead he said I am
[26:39] the resurrection he said I'm the God of
[26:44] Abraham Isaac and Jacob I'm the one that
[26:48] was at the burning bush
[26:50] I sent humans last madnes come on but
[26:58] the very God that was inside of that
[27:00] human man standing that we call Jesus
[27:02] was in the burning bush as the Almighty
[27:08] God do we believe him like that is
[27:21] resurrection to you and I looking for
[27:25] something to come a day to time a season
[27:30] a point
[27:42] what would Jesus say if he's standing
[27:44] here today
[27:53] do you understand what I'm getting at it
[27:59] looks like Martha made some great
[28:01] statements and they were great
[28:08] she was declaring that he could do those
[28:11] things that God working through him
[28:14] could manifest all these things but he
[28:21] simply says to Martha nieces what are
[28:27] you looking for a God somewheres else
[28:30] you want me to go talk to God for you so
[28:37] that's what you're declaring me to do
[28:43] but he said I am the resurrection
[28:54] is there anything that could have a
[28:56] stood in the way to keeping Lazarus from
[28:59] raising from the dead it would look good
[29:05] enough in Martha's confession her
[29:11] confession was we've seen this we know
[29:14] it can be done we've seen what you've
[29:15] done in your ministries enough now just
[29:18] ask God the Lazarus will rise he said I
[29:28] don't know how to ask God said I am God
[29:34] you just don't recognize that you're
[29:38] looking at something else he said but
[29:42] for one time look straight at me
[29:47] he said I am the resurrection
[29:58] see he was showing who he was to Martha
[30:10] and she still couldn't follow it right
[30:15] as this message brought to us a head
[30:20] knowledge I remember in the Baptist
[30:28] Church I used to read the Bible and and
[30:30] think about why would those fire scenes
[30:32] kill the Lord Jesus for all he done
[30:34] being good you'll remember reading like
[30:37] that I read the Bible that's not a
[30:44] trying to find us talking to somebody
[30:47] the other day about this so you try to
[30:50] find something you're looking over what
[30:56] you're reading read the Bible read the
[31:05] prophets message anyway instead of
[31:07] trying to find some key some point some
[31:12] great revelation I remember when they
[31:18] love you remember when they they finally
[31:21] it they found 24 believe it was on the
[31:23] tape sit in the back somewhere around
[31:26] the seventies I guess
[31:30] well everybody just flooded them to get
[31:33] those 24 tapes because they thought
[31:39] that's gonna get some secret though
[31:42] these things has been hid all these year
[31:44] and we will get some secret now what to
[31:46] do
[31:55] everybody's always looking for some kind
[31:57] of a something to happen looking for a
[32:00] resurrection when we're gonna stop
[32:07] looking for the resurrection and start
[32:09] looking after resurrect he said I am the
[32:12] resurrection that right there was a
[32:20] statement that connected the entire
[32:22] Bible together to who this man really is
[32:34] he said before Abraham was I am
[32:40] well they realized you know that he was
[32:43] saying something so they said well
[32:46] you're a man not over 50 and you claim
[32:52] you seen Abraham I'm just trying to get
[32:57] you think about something about the
[32:59] resurrection
[33:08] thinking about the resurrection instead
[33:11] of thinking about what it is or trying
[33:14] to find it as I said read the Bible
[33:20] don't read it as trying to find some
[33:23] secret coded word I never seen that
[33:28] before
[33:29] I remember back in the seventies part of
[33:36] you remember not old enough to remember
[33:38] a lot of these doctrines that went forth
[33:40] in the message but you know there was a
[33:43] lot of things statements made and like
[33:47] that to try to to show you that they
[33:49] were looking for some secret coded keys
[33:52] you know something we hadn't found
[33:57] before work what if he found secret
[34:04] coded keys
[34:06] you know they claim the Bible can be
[34:08] broke down into two different many
[34:10] different sects and different cults
[34:12] you've read about him what did that
[34:16] bring Christ
[34:21] see that's what Martha was doing she was
[34:23] looking for something she was saying if
[34:27] you hadn't been here this wouldn't
[34:30] happen but said now it's happened we
[34:40] said now I know and believe that you
[34:42] have look enough connection to God that
[34:47] if you'll ask him what didn't she say we
[34:52] know who you are speak the word she
[34:58] didn't have that much she had a great
[35:01] understanding was she now that much she
[35:05] was still looking for somebody to try to
[35:08] help her do something
[35:16] Jesus said I am the resurrection
[35:26] I'm the god of the word now if you don't
[35:32] get nothing out of the message today get
[35:34] this much
[35:36] Jesus didn't say I hope I am maybe I am
[35:39] or maybe a wheel or maybe this will take
[35:41] place whatever he said I am the
[35:44] resurrection he was very positive about
[35:47] what he said you know he knew back three
[35:52] or four days before then remember
[35:55] whether the disciples in the running up
[35:58] to that period of time and they called
[35:59] for him and trying to get him to come
[36:01] and everything and he finally turned
[36:02] around and told him he said look boys
[36:04] let's go
[36:10] he said I want you to know because they
[36:13] kept saying well and he said you know
[36:15] Lazarus sleep well if he's sleeping he's
[36:17] doing pretty good oh that's the best
[36:21] flower him you know let him sleep awhile
[36:24] he said look I'm trying to tell you
[36:28] Lazarus is dead I'm going to raise him
[36:37] now if there's Bibles riding your
[36:40] prophet says he never done nothing till
[36:42] he's seen it so he's already seen
[36:45] Lazarus raised so he didn't have no
[36:48] problem he wouldn't go at hoping or
[36:53] guessing her thinking it and he wasn't
[36:55] putting it back on Martha's confession
[36:58] he had his own when are you getting that
[37:06] I'm getting it a positive attitude when
[37:10] are we gonna start doing that so we're
[37:15] looking for gimmicks and looking for
[37:17] thoughts I don't look for those things I
[37:24] don't look for a secret coated thing I
[37:26] read the Bible to see what it says
[37:36] because it's
[37:37] that's what it means and it means what
[37:40] it says
[37:41] so why am I looking for secret coded
[37:42] outfits somewhere certain words some
[37:45] thoughts will not take what it says yeah
[37:59] but I just can't understand I come down
[38:01] through there - I can remember when I
[38:06] was in the Baptist Church and studying
[38:08] trying to study the Word of God because
[38:11] see I had that kind of an idea and you
[38:17] know what I started doing I started then
[38:21] reading the Bible on the basis of
[38:25] reading it to see what it said not what
[38:30] somebody taught me that it said I like
[38:38] to get the definitions of words if you
[38:42] take my Bible and read it you'll find a
[38:44] lot of definitional words in there you
[38:46] know places were that I couldn't figure
[38:48] out that definition of what that was
[38:50] meaning so I went in the Webster's and
[38:52] got it and wrote down the definition did
[38:57] you know what I wound up doing reading
[39:00] what it said when brother Dale I've read
[39:05] brother runs matching but I just can't
[39:07] see that can't see what
[39:16] the Bible has never declared but one
[39:19] true and living God and never declared a
[39:24] Trinity or anything like that right it
[39:30] was God speaking to us well why don't we
[39:33] read it that way the Prophet never came
[39:38] to change the book to change a word
[39:41] everything right well we just didn't
[39:51] know this we didn't know that come on
[39:53] it's about time we get off with some of
[39:55] our play pretty parties and get down to
[39:58] listening to the truth God said unless
[40:07] you believe that I am he know that what
[40:11] Jesus said that Oh see but if you get it
[40:19] correctly you'll say that he said unless
[40:21] you believe that I'll a who Jesus so
[40:23] Jesus was God no he was a second Berta
[40:31] he was ever see what I mean
[40:34] we've spent all of our lives trying to
[40:36] figure out what the Bible said when all
[40:39] we had to do was read it where did your
[40:45] prophet change the wording of the Bible
[40:52] he says that the ends and the box is in
[40:55] the right place we don't have a Bible
[41:04] according to William Branham
[41:11] we have the Word of God the Prophet come
[41:20] to tell us to believe what it said read
[41:31] simple what we just read Martha Mary
[41:38] they said word to Jesus trying to tell
[41:43] him hey Lazarus is dead
[41:51] and he just goes the other way he waits
[41:56] longer and longer remember the story of
[41:59] prophet told it finally he comes back
[42:03] and when they see him what is it no
[42:08] don't we know Jesus we know that Lazarus
[42:12] is dead I said we were hoping that if
[42:19] you be here he wouldn't have died I said
[42:25] now I've got enough confidence in you
[42:27] cause I've seen it happen before
[42:28] that you'd ask God and God would do it
[42:30] see they never looked at him as being
[42:32] God they looked at him as a possibility
[42:34] of contacting God that's what I'm
[42:37] getting at are you following me
[42:40] and what I'm trying to get you to see
[42:44] instead of seeing who he was and
[42:47] determining when he said I am the
[42:50] resurrection well maybe he's
[42:54] resurrection I don't know maybe we can
[42:56] do this maybe we do that maybe we can
[42:57] find this you have we've seen these
[42:59] things honesty you see what I'm talking
[43:00] about
[43:03] he spoke very positive and he said I am
[43:07] the resurrection in other words he
[43:09] declared I'm the same God that spoke to
[43:11] Moses from the burning bush I was in the
[43:15] burning bush read the book of Acts the
[43:19] seventh chapter and you'll find it it
[43:20] talking of the Lord Jesus Christ being
[43:22] there
[43:24] who do you think that was now not the
[43:27] human flesh the god that was dwelling in
[43:32] the flesh was Almighty God and he was
[43:40] trying to tell Mary said Mary and Martha
[43:42] said Martha few just look you had your
[43:46] confidence built in me on the basis that
[43:48] things could happen with me being around
[43:50] I said I want you to know I'm trying to
[43:55] get you to see who I am
[43:58] there wasn't no problem with the
[44:00] resurrection that's what I'm trying to
[44:06] get you to see they had already had the
[44:09] dead raised right the dead had done been
[44:17] raised but to find out the hughster of
[44:25] man there was so positive in his
[44:28] statement at least said I am the
[44:30] resurrection and we got it to that point
[44:39] yet they listen if you're following the
[44:52] point of what I'm getting at then follow
[44:56] to another step the date had been raised
[45:00] the Sikh had been healed before the Lord
[45:04] Jesus made that statement am i right
[45:09] okay
[45:16] but you know what your prophet said one
[45:19] day he said all of those things was
[45:24] great but he said on that day of the
[45:29] resurrection he proved who he was now
[45:33] Mariah the Lord Jesus when he raised
[45:38] proved who he was he proved to them that
[45:43] he was the God of Abraham Isaac and
[45:46] Jacob we did accepted he proved to them
[45:50] that he was the God and the burning bush
[45:56] because nobody can raise the dead except
[45:58] God he proved who he was by his own
[46:03] resurrection
[46:08] right he proved who he was by his own
[46:12] resurrection by raising that body did he
[46:17] tell them destroy this body in three
[46:22] days I'll raise it up did it happen
[46:38] are you following me
[46:42] they had their hopes in that this man
[46:46] had some connection with God but they
[46:51] didn't have their hopes in the fact that
[46:52] he was God he was a connecting link to a
[47:00] God that could help them what about you
[47:03] is that all you've got
[47:08] see Jesus had a positive attitude he
[47:12] said I am the resurrection when are we
[47:16] going to become positive in our thinking
[47:26] he said I am the resurrection and one
[47:34] day you say the Dead was raised to sick
[47:37] with heal Lazarus was raised up
[47:39] everything they didn't catch it right
[47:49] they didn't catch on to it and he winds
[47:54] up having to tell him when he raised the
[48:05] scripture says about him you know that
[48:10] he opened their understanding of the
[48:12] scriptures about himself that was before
[48:16] Pentecost now that was before the holy
[48:18] ghost guy there's two times our that it
[48:21] says he opened their understanding of
[48:22] the scripture of who he was but where
[48:28] were they had on the day of Pentecost
[48:35] running like everything scared to death
[48:40] because they didn't see him to be who he
[48:42] was
[48:49] Peter had this great confession yes dark
[48:52] the Christ the Son of the Living God
[48:54] read on through with Martha Martha
[48:56] declares him to be the Christ the Son of
[48:59] God Peter had all of that but yet when
[49:08] the scripture began to be fulfilled that
[49:10] he was going through all those things
[49:11] worst Peter running right follow me and
[49:22] what I'm saying the dead raised the sick
[49:25] heal all that's great but now you can
[49:33] believe this or doing she won't do it I
[49:35] don't care that never attracted my
[49:39] attention when I began to study this
[49:43] message brother mote said we've seen the
[49:47] sick healed we've seen the dead raised
[49:49] we've seen all of these things named
[49:52] people that was there that we would have
[49:54] personal understanding of who they were
[49:56] remembered the tatom's in a different
[49:58] one and I told him I said brother mode I
[50:03] wasn't there you saw those things but I
[50:09] wasn't dark I'm believing you but I'm
[50:12] telling you you tell me what this man
[50:17] taught and I'll know whether he was a
[50:21] prophet or not and he's where do you
[50:24] want to believe it that way that's up to
[50:26] you that's what took place
[50:29] thank God I run into a man that wasn't
[50:33] just boy blessed God you got to believe
[50:34] this got to believe that you know I
[50:37] walked into a man that would tell me the
[50:39] Bible said it and read it to me I loved
[50:41] that
[50:42] brother mote was the type of person he
[50:44] always did it we rode the country with
[50:47] books and everything and I did because I
[50:49] had this memory so much of the colors of
[50:52] the book still brother mote would call
[50:54] out future home and I'd get him a blue
[50:55] book hand it to him or a green one for
[50:57] this one we traveled
[51:02] if he ever said brother branham believed
[51:05] in one God he read it now you that was
[51:08] there with him you know that's true if
[51:11] he said brother Branham believed that he
[51:12] read it that's where I learned that from
[51:15] it's hard to argue with somebody when
[51:18] they're telling you exactly what the man
[51:21] says
[51:25] that's why I'm not scared on the
[51:26] Internet
[51:28] ain't you scared somebody's gonna call
[51:30] you contacting you challenge you and
[51:32] once they come home you're not gonna be
[51:36] challenging me you gonna be challenging
[51:38] where the Prophet said it or not and if
[51:40] I read what he said what am I worried
[51:42] about don't bother me at all Church
[51:51] following me and what I'm saying the
[51:55] dead had been raised the sick had been
[51:57] healed Martha and then Mary later into a
[52:01] - was saying the same thing north across
[52:03] the Son of God
[52:05] they had a great confidence built into
[52:08] this man that they called Jesus but he
[52:14] was trying to get him to see who he was
[52:16] that he was Almighty God not a son of
[52:25] God not a second person other he was
[52:27] trying to get him to see that then they
[52:34] looked at this man one day and they saw
[52:37] him beat to smithereens to look like a
[52:41] Bible you and declare it how they've
[52:42] beaten so much it looked like a piece of
[52:44] hamburger meat bread around describes it
[52:45] just cut to pieces
[52:54] you realize Martha and Mary and M was
[52:56] sitting there saying we've seen him do
[52:58] this we've seen him do that we've seen
[53:00] this editor Lee says why can't he walk
[53:02] away why is all this happening to him
[53:09] why couldn't he just get up and walk out
[53:12] said we've seen him do that the Bible
[53:14] tells it one time they were taking him
[53:16] out to stone him he just turns around
[53:18] walks out they wouldn't have the skirt
[53:24] on he just did some way he disappeared
[53:26] you know to their understanding they
[53:30] just walked out
[53:35] are you following what I'm trying to get
[53:38] you to see even after he had told them
[53:45] what would happen described in almost
[53:49] minut detail of relating them back to
[53:53] scriptures even with with you know
[53:55] telling them to go back and this does
[53:58] not this speak of that does not this
[53:59] speak of that and knowing that he had to
[54:06] die and not a one of them understood it
[54:10] right not a one of them coming okay Lord
[54:14] we know you got to die so we'll go with
[54:16] you no they didn't even want to go with
[54:19] him they didn't want to be around him
[54:22] they run I have to see it all of these
[54:25] things do you think they believed he'd
[54:29] raised oh it was a rumor and quote to
[54:34] come on right
[54:38] it was so much on the first day when him
[54:42] disappear till it was called a rumor a
[54:47] rumor went around that he had raised
[54:56] well
[54:58] what happened to the great understanding
[55:01] of Martha and Mary to be we know you can
[55:05] do this we know God is with you what
[55:11] didn't they remember what he was just
[55:12] saying he said destroy this body and
[55:16] I'll raise it up I am the resurrection
[55:25] didn't somebody come up with that idea
[55:31] no they were all running backwards
[55:33] before trying to find somebody with some
[55:36] kind of an answer then he walks among
[55:41] them don't tell me when Jesus walked
[55:47] among them that they all jumped up now
[55:49] glory hallelujah he's right he's here
[55:51] now now they're scared to death cause
[55:52] they didn't know what is going on they
[55:57] were in Orkut early and shocked to see
[56:03] him standing there oh we make light of
[56:08] Thomas right we make light oh yeah they
[56:15] did that Thomas was the one that didn't
[56:16] believe where as in the rest of them
[56:18] that believed it
[56:20] Thomas believed it more than they did
[56:22] I've always defended him because you
[56:26] know what all it took just put his hand
[56:28] as quick as he put his hand he was the
[56:31] first one to declare who was standing
[56:33] there right yeah we sold that he didn't
[56:41] believe Peter then was shaken to death
[56:44] as scared to death it's all secured when
[56:47] he walked among them he said peace be
[56:51] still
[56:57] after a little while it took a settling
[56:59] down part you know what I'm talking
[57:02] about it took him a little while and all
[57:03] at once they begin to settle in and they
[57:06] begin to realize who he was but they
[57:08] still couldn't figure it out because you
[57:11] find him in acts one when the Lord Jesus
[57:14] was fixed into a sin that he'd been with
[57:17] him for thirty forty days or something
[57:19] so many days that he'd been with him
[57:21] after his resurrection and he who begins
[57:24] to descend during the book of Acts one I
[57:26] think he did
[57:27] and they said will you restore the
[57:28] kingdom to Israel at this time but Iran
[57:33] said they were still thinking about
[57:34] Jesus having some kind of a natural
[57:36] Kingdom now if you followed me through
[57:43] the thought could we have this great
[57:48] understanding of believing the Bible
[57:51] believing the message believing the
[57:53] things and it not produced the god of
[58:00] the word are we afraid here in the last
[58:09] days that things are falling apart
[58:20] what about it see then he proved when he
[58:27] raised he proved who he was
[58:34] when he raised he proved that he was the
[58:39] IM of the Old Testament Ezekiel or extra
[58:43] disk Guzman 3 he proved a tax seven and
[58:49] 3738 that he was at the burning bush he
[58:56] proved when he said I am that Bread of
[58:58] Life he said before Abraham was I am
[59:03] now listen is it true that the Bible
[59:06] said that he opened their understanding
[59:09] of the scriptures well see these are the
[59:16] things that begin to be opening true he
[59:22] proved that he was the I am of the Old
[59:24] Testament and that the I am of the Old
[59:27] Testament was the Lord Jesus Christ our
[59:29] Jehovah than you his resurrection proved
[59:34] it a lot of things could be based upon
[59:38] wondering and all and that's what I'm
[59:40] trying to tell you they already had had
[59:42] the dead raised to sit healed in the
[59:44] time before the resurrection of the Lord
[59:46] Jesus
[59:50] but that resurrection proved proved who
[59:53] he was
[59:56] it proved then when he got to the place
[59:59] that he raised that his positive
[1:00:04] statement was true he said I am the
[1:00:09] resurrection that was proved to be true
[1:00:16] when he raised his own bodies
[1:00:28] proved there was something alive instead
[1:00:31] of a dead words or letters on the page I
[1:00:35] believe this or I believe that the Bible
[1:00:37] says that the Prophet said it all that's
[1:00:40] well and good but what about your
[1:00:42] revelation
[1:00:52] what about it what about your profit
[1:00:58] making this statement to us message
[1:01:03] called faith 1961 your resurrection lays
[1:01:08] inside of you in your spirit okay
[1:01:14] immediately now that here we go boy
[1:01:17] we're revelaed heed hope brother Dale
[1:01:20] he said darts in our spirit it's in our
[1:01:22] spirit and the resurrection of that
[1:01:25] experience it ain't nice in his flesh it
[1:01:29] ain't in them five senses called our
[1:01:32] spirit but the Prophet said it was he
[1:01:39] said that spirit that he's talking about
[1:01:42] was the Spirit of God our five senses
[1:01:45] spirit is not the spirit of God that's
[1:01:49] why it's got to be redeemed just what
[1:01:51] I'm saying
[1:01:52] see we're not Martha and Mary name we've
[1:01:54] quickly jumped to a conclusion or a
[1:01:57] thought
[1:01:57] instead of taking what the Prophet is
[1:02:00] saying to us and listening to what he's
[1:02:02] saying we're taking it as to whether or
[1:02:06] not it's the spirit or the soul or
[1:02:08] whether it's this or whether it's that
[1:02:10] well he said it was the spirit so I can
[1:02:14] see that brother now I can see that I
[1:02:16] can see that within my memories I can't
[1:02:22] that's what a brother done here one time
[1:02:24] in the ministers meeting was a heaven
[1:02:26] I won't call his name but somebody made
[1:02:28] a statement he got it he said I can see
[1:02:30] that I've got up I said I saw it ain't
[1:02:36] cold it's wrong of course I wouldn't
[1:02:41] like but if it was wrong when I say it
[1:02:47] was wrong we see to him I can see that I
[1:02:51] said I can't ain't caught it's wrong
[1:02:56] it's time for us to settle down on the
[1:02:59] basis of what do we believe
[1:03:01] all right yeah and like I said while ago
[1:03:08] instead of finding some key will not
[1:03:12] read what he says okay go ahead let's
[1:03:16] read it give me just a minute go ahead
[1:03:19] brothers pull up number five and let's
[1:03:23] read it okay this is the message called
[1:03:32] faith paragraph one when you got to use
[1:03:35] faith in God to make it work these so
[1:03:40] you've got your own resurrection inside
[1:03:44] of you now listen your resurrection lays
[1:03:49] inside of you in your spirit whatever to
[1:03:54] you it's in the spirit why cut it off
[1:03:58] that's what you do you won't read the
[1:04:01] rest of the message you won't listen to
[1:04:06] him explain what he's talking about it's
[1:04:12] just in my spirit if I get my spirit
[1:04:13] straightened out we'd be all right I
[1:04:15] agree we if we could get our spirit
[1:04:17] straightened out
[1:04:17] but ain't no boat one way to get that
[1:04:19] spirit straight now let's kill it
[1:04:24] annihilate that spirit control of us and
[1:04:32] let this simple word be the answer those
[1:04:35] look the resurrected lays inside of you
[1:04:37] in your spirit now you know when Jesus
[1:04:40] died on the cross his soul descended
[1:04:43] into hell and preached to the souls that
[1:04:45] were in prison
[1:04:46] well no no no no spirit lamp because the
[1:04:48] Bible says his spirit when the Bible
[1:04:50] says that the Bible says it was his
[1:04:56] spirit did when the Prophet said it was
[1:04:59] a soul at one
[1:05:05] when Jesus died on the cross his soul
[1:05:07] descended into hell and preached to the
[1:05:09] souls that were in prison that repented
[1:05:12] not in the long suffering the days of
[1:05:13] Noah his body went into the grave but
[1:05:17] before he died he committed his spirit
[1:05:19] into the hands of God
[1:05:22] into the hands into thy hands commit
[1:05:26] come in my spirit so you see his spirit
[1:05:30] went to God his soul went to hell and
[1:05:33] his body went to the grave
[1:05:34] now that spirit that was in him not mine
[1:05:42] and yours that spirit that was in him
[1:05:46] was the Spirit of God our spirit is not
[1:05:55] the spirit of God
[1:05:58] it's the spirit of our reason and memory
[1:06:01] conscience affections etc come on and
[1:06:04] that spirit and Sundra times and divers
[1:06:07] manners anointed the prophets to bring
[1:06:09] the message to the people and the last
[1:06:11] days through Christ now in these days
[1:06:13] here through the gospel people reading
[1:06:18] on down onto those things he says you
[1:06:24] have the power in you now to create a
[1:06:31] world is it laying in your spirit no
[1:06:38] can't be in your spirit because that's
[1:06:41] memory reason conscious that's contrary
[1:06:52] I listen why are you looking for a
[1:06:56] resurrection when you already have the
[1:06:59] resurrection in you so you're gonna be
[1:07:02] tied up and that's what I'm true with
[1:07:04] that I still forget it I ain't reading
[1:07:06] the rest of it because you see that's
[1:07:09] where the argument among the ministers
[1:07:11] of this message spirit sölden go back
[1:07:14] and reading the 61 I've taught it to you
[1:07:18] up until not about 1964 63 brother
[1:07:22] branham basically taught body soul
[1:07:27] spirit after the opening of the seals
[1:07:34] and thing he taught body spirit soul
[1:07:41] well which one's right he was right in
[1:07:43] both places because in the early
[1:07:46] ministry he was describing the five
[1:07:49] senses of the second realm of mankind
[1:07:52] whether he called his spirit or soul
[1:07:54] that doesn't make no difference to me he
[1:07:57] was right the opening of the word
[1:08:00] brought the truth into being to him so
[1:08:10] then here's my point I thought we said
[1:08:13] we believed the scripture I thought we
[1:08:17] believe that we were resurrected is this
[1:08:20] Bible now or now resurrect hidden doing
[1:08:22] what sitting in heavenly places in
[1:08:25] Christ Jesus I thought that's what the
[1:08:28] Bible explains the new birth is being
[1:08:31] but the new birth is the Spirit of
[1:08:34] Christ coming in us to give a birth to
[1:08:37] you and me to give us eternal life and
[1:08:39] to put an inside teacher into us that
[1:08:46] would not be an outside person so your
[1:08:50] resurrection lays inside of you well if
[1:08:56] I could just just see the Reverend your
[1:08:59] resurrection lays inside of you in that
[1:09:04] new birth that you have
[1:09:11] are we listening are we still like
[1:09:15] Martha and Mary are we still trying to
[1:09:17] figure out some key to connect it to are
[1:09:19] we simply going to believe what the
[1:09:20] Prophet says just leave the word believe
[1:09:25] the Bible the resurrect is sitting in
[1:09:29] heavenly places in Christ Jesus amend
[1:09:31] them you want your resurrection see then
[1:09:38] is inside of you it's in your being it's
[1:09:42] what you are when you're born again
[1:09:44] that puts Christ in you the hope of
[1:09:47] glory well I don't understand it cuz
[1:09:54] it's it's fear now I got to say I don't
[1:09:56] care what you I've got spirit okay go
[1:09:58] right ahead I ain't arguing with nobody
[1:10:00] I've taught this for an almost 50 years
[1:10:02] saying argue will you not know that I'm
[1:10:08] gonna tell you how stupid we all are I
[1:10:11] said about the best basis of it instead
[1:10:15] of just believing what God said through
[1:10:17] a prophet we try to figure out what the
[1:10:19] Prophet saying it's not that the same
[1:10:26] thing we've done with the Bible that we
[1:10:31] tried to figure out what it was saying
[1:10:32] instead of reading what it would say it
[1:10:35] where is there anything more plainer
[1:10:38] than what did it John 3:16 for God so
[1:10:42] loved the world that He gave His only
[1:10:43] begotten Son
[1:10:44] well I wasn't God we got over here in
[1:10:46] the Sun over here that's what I'm
[1:10:47] talking to you about see that was Mary
[1:10:50] and Martha's problem they were trying to
[1:10:54] talk to this man that they thought had a
[1:10:57] connection to God instead of seeing that
[1:10:59] man was God now that's the best way I
[1:11:03] can describe it is that what we're
[1:11:06] trying to do
[1:11:12] they just simply believe when Jesus said
[1:11:19] unless you believe that I am here you'll
[1:11:20] die in your sins does that need
[1:11:26] interpreting does it need interpreting
[1:11:34] that your resurrection lays inside of
[1:11:37] you does it need to be interpreted that
[1:11:43] we are the children of God we are his
[1:11:45] offspring does it need to be interpreted
[1:11:48] you must be born again
[1:11:53] what are you talking about brother than
[1:11:56] what are you trying to get Jesus had a
[1:11:57] positive attitude when he said I am the
[1:12:00] resurrection he was saying Martha don't
[1:12:03] you realize you heard the story about
[1:12:05] the burning bush you heard that I am
[1:12:08] that I am he said I am that resurrection
[1:12:19] but you know not another thing was said
[1:12:22] of Martha and Mary about that read your
[1:12:24] Bible
[1:12:24] jesus said just show me where you put
[1:12:26] him right they didn't say come on now
[1:12:33] then come on now we believe who you are
[1:12:35] go raise him didn't do it he said just
[1:12:41] show me were you lady I like the
[1:12:49] statement that was made by someone one
[1:12:51] time about it when he come to Lazarus he
[1:12:53] said Lazarus come for sit what if he
[1:12:56] said all of them come for what if he'd
[1:12:59] call for ever born again I mean every
[1:13:01] person that would ever to be a Christian
[1:13:03] I mean for what if he's got ever come
[1:13:05] forward he specified who he's won't
[1:13:07] leaves won't Lazarus because he wanted
[1:13:11] them to see that he could do it not brag
[1:13:15] about it and show how good he was but to
[1:13:17] show them who he was they had their
[1:13:20] confidence in a great thing it was
[1:13:22] wonderful of their confidence that they
[1:13:24] had in him
[1:13:25] if you just have been here he's been
[1:13:30] alright anyway even now even now
[1:13:33] whatever you ask God whatever you asked
[1:13:37] is not a person they never said whatever
[1:13:44] you say will be it right if you just say
[1:13:53] it that'll take care of it no come on
[1:13:59] musician Easter message what is your
[1:14:05] Easter message you hear the great
[1:14:08] stories are going through and that's
[1:14:10] wonderful I love them too of all the
[1:14:12] things in the different things telling
[1:14:14] you know when there's that in the other
[1:14:21] but there stood a man that declared
[1:14:26] himself to be Almighty God as the Easter
[1:14:31] opened that understanding to you
[1:14:34] as your new birth has your understanding
[1:14:37] as you're studying this message has it
[1:14:40] brought Jesus Christ to you as a person
[1:14:47] not as a thought or a concept or an idea
[1:14:50] not in a memory reason conscience water
[1:14:53] but in your very being of who you are
[1:14:55] can you say inside of me lives I'm not
[1:15:01] looking for a resurrection I've been
[1:15:05] looking at the resurrection over fifty
[1:15:06] years when I saw it I'm not looking for
[1:15:13] a rapture you're not know cuz
[1:15:17] resurrection comes for rapture simple
[1:15:23] but that you simply believe in the Word
[1:15:25] of God I just simply believe the Word of
[1:15:30] God the Bible said the dead in Christ
[1:15:32] shall rise first and we which are alive
[1:15:34] and remain meet you
[1:15:38] a brother years ago gave me a great big
[1:15:47] book wanted me to write down these
[1:15:49] thoughts and concepts on and the point
[1:15:55] was this now he wanted to know should we
[1:15:59] have communion and then foot washing or
[1:16:06] should we have foot washing first and
[1:16:08] then have communion why does it make any
[1:16:16] difference is there some great
[1:16:20] revelation involved here
[1:16:22] I said now according to what we
[1:16:30] understand we can read the Bible of the
[1:16:35] foot washing you know in the thing and
[1:16:41] the breaking of the bread and the way it
[1:16:44] sounds the way we've always taught it is
[1:16:47] that you had to communion the bread
[1:16:49] first and then you had the foot worship
[1:16:51] I said what is a great thing well I read
[1:16:55] this brother sword so I read this this
[1:16:58] this book about this man and he said we
[1:17:01] had it backwards said we spoke to how
[1:17:04] the foot washing first and then out of
[1:17:06] the communion I said well where's that
[1:17:12] going changes you know in other words
[1:17:15] what's that gonna make any difference
[1:17:18] let's see to him I was degrading his
[1:17:24] spiritual understanding till he wouldn't
[1:17:27] speak to me for about five years I ain't
[1:17:30] joking the next time I contacted I'm
[1:17:33] called him and his wife was on the phone
[1:17:35] and I said I'd like to speak to brother
[1:17:38] so-and-so and she turns around and says
[1:17:42] it loud enough that I could hear
[1:17:43] everything she said and hear everything
[1:17:45] he said and she said brother so and
[1:17:48] brother dad's wanting you bro he
[1:17:51] said brother who when he come to the
[1:17:56] phone
[1:17:56] I said yeah brother Dale about five
[1:17:59] years ago was the last contact we had
[1:18:01] but I haven't changed my name the heel
[1:18:07] he was so upset at me because I didn't
[1:18:11] agree with a foot washing of the
[1:18:12] community I hope you listen to the
[1:18:20] message today or in your thoughts Martha
[1:18:24] and Mary had these things all figured
[1:18:25] out
[1:18:27] Jesus didn't fuss with him and argue
[1:18:29] with him he just let him go through all
[1:18:31] of their whole line and he didn't raise
[1:18:34] Lazarus on the knee of what they said he
[1:18:37] just turned back around and he said
[1:18:38] listen I'm the god of the word in four
[1:18:45] days ago he showed me the resurrection
[1:18:49] of Lazarus said now show me where he's
[1:18:52] at simple is this message becomes simple
[1:19:01] to you or a great theological point I
[1:19:07] know I know how you think my brother
[1:19:11] Dale waged on the seals we don't need to
[1:19:13] understand these sealed we need to
[1:19:14] understand these simple thing simple
[1:19:17] time your prophet told him that ought to
[1:19:21] be simple enough
[1:19:26] he thought it ought to be simple enough
[1:19:31] what about at church Jesus had a
[1:19:36] positive statement about it when he said
[1:19:39] I am the resurrection can you make a
[1:19:47] positive statement and say by the new
[1:19:50] birth now listen I have the resurrection
[1:19:55] inside of me then you state that this
[1:20:02] stated
[1:20:03] by the new birth I have the resurrection
[1:20:07] inside of me I sniffle enough Mustang oh
[1:20:15] we got really how is empty about having
[1:20:23] a your stone is rolled away
[1:20:31] Pastis type
[1:20:39] which is concur
[1:20:41] in me
[1:20:47] there's a lot
[1:20:49] [Music]
[1:20:52] think about him
[1:20:54] [Music]
[1:21:43] no problem your healing side
[1:21:48] and if you resurrections inside of here
[1:21:53] your healing is out of you
[1:21:55] let's go fake it
[1:21:59] [Music]
[1:22:02] quit trying to read something to figure
[1:22:05] it out reading what it said and money
[1:22:14] ups it have a name Christ
[1:22:16] [Music]
[1:22:21] I doubt the promise was to bring a pride
[1:22:38] of people to a place that they could
[1:22:40] speak the word if that's not what you
[1:22:44] studied the message and found I would
[1:22:46] ask you to study it some more to try to
[1:22:52] get us to the basis of believing who we
[1:22:54] are what we're here for and to speak
[1:23:02] let him make it manifest let's go say it
[1:23:11] see when you're hurt and say bye stripes
[1:23:14] I'm healed
[1:23:21] you ever been hurting so bad do you just
[1:23:23] didn't even feel like you could say that
[1:23:25] but what does that got to do with it
[1:23:32] just coming to a realization to realize
[1:23:35] that you and I are the bride of Jesus
[1:23:37] Christ and he's waiting on us to speak
[1:23:45] the word and I see them now I have to
[1:23:57] we stand in a church one dominus young
[1:23:59] convert person minister got up boy he
[1:24:03] was in ninth and making light of him
[1:24:06] telling you what happened he said I take
[1:24:08] every spirit in this building under my
[1:24:10] control I said God don't turn them
[1:24:12] devils loose because he ain't got
[1:24:15] nothing under his control he said we'll
[1:24:19] give you the right say that because you
[1:24:23] have problems you know nothing under
[1:24:26] control it was out of control the your
[1:24:33] you're looking at a man is very funny as
[1:24:36] a brother used to come to church here
[1:24:38] and I'd ask God not to do nothing while
[1:24:41] he was here you're stupid I'll agree
[1:24:45] with you but I knew one thing for
[1:24:50] certain he'd take away and he'd go and
[1:24:52] he'd run it it would be going wrong I
[1:24:56] said Lord just don't do nothing while
[1:24:58] he's here
[1:25:02] you know what one day I told it I said
[1:25:07] brother have you ever noticed when you
[1:25:08] come to Loula God don't do nothing
[1:25:11] that's because I've asked him because
[1:25:14] you ain't ride more he didn't like that
[1:25:16] that was true
[1:25:22] so I want God to do it I'm not trying to
[1:25:26] build you up to get you to pump up to
[1:25:28] speak something call for something I'm
[1:25:30] trying to get you to just simply believe
[1:25:32] the word and let that just drop down in
[1:25:34] your heart and then you just speak back
[1:25:36] from your heart say thank you
[1:25:43] there's the resurrection the
[1:25:48] resurrection is to see a person not a
[1:25:51] doctrine or an idea it's the person of
[1:25:54] Jesus Christ living in me and you
[1:26:02] Lord Jesus as we go into natural media
[1:26:05] we ask you to just help us help us to
[1:26:09] see Lord that you truly have made and we
[1:26:12] didn't get to the thought you have made
[1:26:14] all things new a new creation a new
[1:26:19] people that could believe your word and
[1:26:25] we thank you got us in Jesus now you
