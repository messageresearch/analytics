days we'll talk about it for a million years and then we'll have another million to talk about if you would have your seats and musicians go ahead and sit down we've got a special testimony this afternoon from sister esther blatt esther black come and give us your testimony so um basically i got saved and here's how it happened um for a while of course i've wanted the new birth and uh recently it was just kind of like i'd get close to god then i'd kind of go back out then i'd get close to god it was just a constant tug of war and um i was tired of it you know i had had enough of it and so um i just really wanted the new birth you know and everyone would tell me you know you just have faith to believe and i was like yeah i grew up in the message i know these things i know the steps and stuff but i was like i don't know how to believe i don't know how to get the faith i need so um i was basically trying to do it on my own which was the problem you don't want to do that um so yeah it was just a constant tug of war between uh god and the devil you know and um so i just didn't really know how to be sincere in my heart so i started praying and asking god like please reveal to me like please show me how to get the faith i need just give me the faith i need so um i had started really praying about it maybe a week about a week before brother brother trevor came to preach and so god gave me an answer through his testimony and his testimony was that you know that brother face timed him and he said you know just confess just confess and so i was like okay you know you know i hear you talking to me god so um me and zach were riding in the car later and we were just talking about the services and um we were just talking about that and i i was telling zach you know like you know i was really struggling i don't really know how to have faith to get the new birth and zach was like well just do a i told uh him about how brother trevor had said just confess and he was like well then confess and the thing is i had said the words you know i decided to discuss my savior but you know i had said those words but nothing really seemed to happen and of course i had experiences at camps and stuff where the holy spirit would fall on me but i was never like satisfied after you know and um so he was like just confess it right now and it was kind of like how brother brandon would go in the woods and he would be like two plus two is four two plus two weeks four and it would just get stronger and stronger and so um he just said just keep confessing it and so i said okay i accepted this question my favorite he said say it again and at that point the presence of god with it was there and he was like say it again and i said i said jesus christ my savior and then he said say it again say it like you mean it you know and i was like i said jesus christ my savior and he said claim your heritage and say it again and at this point i knew that it wasn't it was god speaking through zach and not that creepy and it was like a spiritual connection and right there in the passenger seat of zach's car accepted jesus christ my savior and um so we got home and he told me just keep packing the word in just keep packing it in and that's what i did so i opened the bible app on my phone and there happened to be psalms 116 open and i knew for a fact that i had it after reading it and let me just read all this scripture it's not long this is my new birth scripture but it says i love the lord because he because he hath heard my my voice and my supplications because he hath inclined his ear unto me therefore will i call upon him as long as i live the sorrows of death compass me and the pains of hell get hold upon me i found trouble and sorrow then called that upon the name of the lord o lord i beseech thee deliver my soul gracious is the lord and righteous yea our god is merciful the lord preserveth the simple i was brought low and he helped me return unto thy rest o my soul for the lord hath dealt bound to flee with thee that's right for thou hast delivered my soul from death my eyes from tears and my feet from falling i will walk before the lord in the land of the living i believe therefore have i spoken i was greatly afflicted i said in my haste all men are liars what shall i render unto the lord for all his benefits towards me i will take the cup of salvation and call upon the name of the lord i will pay my vows unto the lord now in the presence of all his people precious in the sight of the lord is the death of his saints o true o lord truly i am thy servant i am thy servant and the son of thine handmaid thou has to loose my bonds i will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving and will call upon the name of the lord i will pay my vows into the lord now in the presence of all his people in the courts of the lord's house in the midst of the o jerusalem praise you the lord and so yeah that's the scripture i read after and um it was the most amazing thing ever knowing that my chains were finally gone and i had been set free and um i just thought that this part was interesting but zach ended up going downstairs to hold my dog daisy and i was upstairs reading my bottle and i just heard daisy barking downstairs like really loudly and she usually doesn't act like that daisy's like a good dog and so zack comes upstairs he's like oh my gosh you won't believe what just happened so he said that he was downstairs holding daisy and she just starts barking at the couch like crazy just out of the couch and a hairstyle stand up on her back and she's just barking going crazy and um he said that he sets her down and she's just kind of circling the couch like barking just looking at the couch so he says he gets close to that spot and the presence of god is just so strong there so i don't know if my dog saw like an angel appeal if i don't know what she saw but the spirit of god was in that room but um uh since then i've been pressing onto the christian and seeking more and more revelation and i was also gifted by god by something not many people have the opportunity to be to be gifted with and that's parents that pray for me and uh press through and pray for my salvation because i probably won't be standing here giving this testimony if it wasn't for them they're probably pretty relieved right now but yeah anyways thank you that's my testimony that dog saw a ghost the holy ghost man you you need that yeah you get all excited and you lose your face mask you're welcome all right now who's next who's next hey man who's next the door's open amen goodness what a testimony now i'll tell you something else that was um sunday afternoon when he was going home right yeah so brother trevor comes to the house sunday night and i think he before even he talked to bob on monday morning and he kind of was um he wasn't yeah he kind of was it was a little dejected that that there wasn't as much participation the second service and um i i told him i said well look we're just a cautious bunch of people you know we're taught to be cautious that's the only thing i could say because some of y'all sit there like your stone face and you know he said i didn't know what anybody was getting or doing or anything he said i just felt like it was you you no you didn't say useless but you know i just didn't feel like anything came about and of course i didn't know about it that esther had that that had happened to sister esther on the way back home from his testimony that he had testified and and i'm kind of like bob when he was when he was at my house i'm like man look there's a purpose for everything you're not gonna get i know for a fact that today with 90 people in the building downstairs and upstairs maybe 30 of you are going to get something you got to decide which dirty you are because the rest are going to you know they're going to work on their tractor or they're going to you know be cutting grass or something in their mind and waiting for tomorrow to get here and i'm talking about holy ghost filled people too i'm not talking about just people that just don't care okay because that's the diversity of our mind that things happen not saying good or bad but i'm just saying that i told brother trevor and i i'll you know i've been trying to talk to the ministers when i was a young guy well i wasn't young when i started ministering but i was young in the lord if you if you base everything on the response of a congregation you're going to be sorely disappointed right but brother dale said told me a long time ago he said and he's told you he preaches to your soul so your soul whether you're sitting there asleep or not maybe getting something subliminally like we were talking about through that fourth dimension but but i don't i told him i said bro trevor if you keep basing your um your success on feelings and emotions and then i took him back to where luis um you know he's got the uh ten thousand worlds brother brown said one soul one saul and brother trevor brought up the um instance where brother rhino said he went to do a meeting and he said he said i got the lamb that i was looking for last night but he didn't discontinue the service i'm sure those other people got healed and other people got saved but the one you come for may just be one so brother trevor and i uh brother bob and i talked monday and and he made a good point he said brother trevor he said once you preach a word he said the bible said it will not return void it will accomplish whether you think see where our expectation has got a slide rule you know we we think wow boy since the i've been in congregations to where the people were shouting speaking in tongues running the aisles and did not know what the preacher was talking about amen amen so what i mean what'd you get the man was bringing the word of god and you were you know blowing it out not you not our congregation that's for sure a lot of congregations blowing it out the whistle and not listening to what's being said but see brother trevor could have come down here the whole weekend we enjoyed both services both services were good and enjoyed his fellowship for a couple of days and he got to fellowship with brother bob bro luis and brother joe and and their families because they've got big message families and they can congregate together and bring a crowd with them when they come but he just came for one person now whether you got something out of it's your deal but he came the word the word in flesh came to get esther black not discluding anybody but she received what it what came and and you know what 10 000 worlds you can't buy what she got just by a testimony sunday you can't buy it with money no money in the world can ever buy that so you know what if you think ministers or even some of you that speak to people if you tell them the word it will never return void it will accomplish what it set out to accomplish it may it's not going to accomplish empty in hospitals it's not going to accomplish saving everybody in the building that would be wonderful but it gets what one here one here that's what we're in now we're in the gleaning part we're in the we're in the cutting of the corners or getting the corners like ruth she's getting they're leaving little handful of god's leaving little hands full of purpose for one lady ruth to get enough barley to sustain her in her life so that's what we're getting now and i i just want us to realize that that it's not uh it's not always the this was successful and this was not preach the gospel if you preach the gospel higher low slow or fast if it saves one soul it's worth everything that any any effort that we do studying and preaching and and laboring and what brother dale's been doing lord for 50 years now almost or longer is getting the people ready for for a body change but it also catches the fish too and and as brother branham you saw on the this morning he was talking about you know throwing the net out he catches the fish along with the frogs and the snakes and everything else but everybody goes where they're supposed to go though the fish you know are there to be eat so thank god for sister esther for you for your testimony and um remember wednesday night brother aaron will be speaking also next sunday i'll be in arizona leaving friday until tuesday we're coming back so we're going to spend some time with brother chris and sister joanna and so bob will be taking second service brother they'll be taking first service next sunday and god bless our brother and sister and their family from chile that was a wonderful wonderful um they just have a musical a whole musical church and and uh you know where's louise louise in there tickets are 750 dollars to go to santiago it's 100 yeah i just looked at that okay you want to go okay again we could drive down there if we could get across that sue i mean not suez canal but the canal we could get across that canal we could go but we can't do that it'd be a long drive their country is 3 000 miles long and 200 miles wide it's desert in the top and they got glaciers in the bottom so they have a very diverse country but you know what we all come from one family the family of god and he knew they'd be chileans he knew they'd be americans he knew they'd be all different kinds and so that's why he loves diversity if you will let's turn our bibles to hebrews 9 11 and let's continue on and for the sake of of our brother and sister being here we're going to kind of back up just a little bit and slow down maybe a little bit i doubt it but we've been talking on speaking on eternal redemption and i hope you're getting something from this because that this thing goes on you're going to be talking about this and you say well boy it's just you know when we carry on a conversation here when we carry on a a church service or a conversation with people you know it goes so far and then it just kind of dwindles off because you just you you get you got something to talk about and then all of a sudden you've already talked about all that so it it dwindles down to where just uh and uh and uh well how about the weather you know you change the subject but not with this eternal redemption because eternal redemption is going to continue to go on it's not going to wane don't tell me anywhere in god's word that you're going to start right here and then you're going down no you're going to start here and you're just going to see more as you go and man it's going to expand by revelation even when we get across on the other side it's going to expand by revelation of all these great things that god has for us so let's bow our heads we've had a wonderful time today and uh we want to try to try to get on with this and get to get to something maybe because i like this word there's a word in the bible that i love more than well about more than any word in the bible it's called immortality immortality because see that sums up everything immortality you can put everything in there from from what we're talking about from eternal redemption all the way to the future home immortality paul says what abolish death and brought life and immortality to light to the gospel down here we know we're going to be eternal up there immortal but we're going to become immortal down here the bible tells us amen that would be that seventh dimension and we may not get to it today but we'll try our best so let's bow our heads lord thank you number one lord for being here with us and also thank you for bringing our sister lord into the family of god by the new birth lord what a it's an oddity now in the end time for a young person to say they get the new birth because satan has given everything in the world in their way to try to keep them from you but father thank god the foolishness of preaching that a fivefold ministry can open up a heart and lord pour your love down in the heart of an individual not even realizing what you're doing as a as a minister or someone testifying but lord when you go to working on their heart lord that's something we cannot do we can only produce the word to in front of them and lord that's what we're doing today let help us to present the word in front of the people so that they can receive lord but father let us not be judged by it let us let us take this lord and let it be something that we hold true in our heart and it will become part of us lord we pray that you'd just be with our brother and sister and family from chile lord we pray that you'd be with them as they journey back lord to their home knowing that it's a temporary home ours is a temporary home here but lord we'll all be together around the throne with you father not too many days from now forgive us of our sins bless this day take care of us lord be with us ones that are sick the ones that were that brother joe there is creating the list for to pray for lord we just pray that the list will get shorter and not longer father we know that you're a healing god and on time god and you sure are a salvation god lord thank you for these things in jesus name amen hebrews 9 verse 11 but christ being come a high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered into in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us you may be seated in the lord as blessing to the reading of the word obtained eternal redemption for us and as we were talking the other wednesday night listen for god to have a plan and for there be to be redemption number one someone had to fall but it had to be a group of people it had to be someone it had to be people not animals and plants and all these different things we know they fell because of what a human did they did not fall of their own self amen it was human being someone with a soul that's why brother louise there with the the quote of brother branham saying and he could only a prophet could look down and say your soul's worth ten thousand worlds how could you put a price on that you can't put a price on it one soul coming to god is worth more than 10 000 and look at the economy look at look at this world what we have in in in resources and all that 10 000 of those one soul is worth 10 000 worlds but to obtain eternal redemption for us that's what made that property become so valuable because god came down in human flesh and died didn't have to wanted to made himself not part of the plan but the plan he was the plan of redemption there's no other way to get redeemed the bible tells us there's no other way to receive jesus the other other way to receive this immortality except through the gospel and who is the gospel jesus christ he's the one that preached the gospel for three and a half years and that's what we got to work on we got three and a half listen we've had 60 years of listening to the prophet and he preached 30 years before that so we've had about 80 years of this great message being on the earth and what has it done what has he done we're still here like i said before he blasted those denominations he he tore him apart and not one church shut down not one organization said not we're going to quit our headquarters and we're going with this man no they just they've got more converts now to the to that false religion than they did when brother branham was here so you say well that didn't do any good he wasn't to them he was saying come out of her my people he was the one he wasn't in the denomination he was standing outside saying come out of her my people now as he was preaching he said the you know the the baptists were okay and the pentecostals were okay and and they were okay for their time billy graham i believe had the new birth for his time he had a place in the bible and that's what he came to and that's all he could come to amen nobody all right with that i mean he was directly um identified in the scripture by the prophet telling us who he was you say well he never accepted the message neither really did f f bosworth he was still a trinitarian all right so he didn't really come to the uh and it's not a concept this message is not a concept this message is reality this is exactly what jesus spoke when jesus was on earth this is exactly what he spoke he was not a denomination he didn't have a denominational idea he didn't have anything to do with what man has done to this eternal plan of redemption so if it's an eternal plan of redemption guess what never changes always the same never changes will not change and that's what we can depend on and as brother dale was speaking this morning you heard me amen more because look we don't have to go through judgment i've told you all that the great one of the greatest revelations that i got of this message is i don't have to stand a judgment i don't have to go through the tribulation period sure we're going to be whatever you want to call it physically bereft or have to i don't think we have to run for our life but i think maybe we're going to have to be like jesus christ was he you know just walk through a crowd and changed their vision and walked right on by amen now if y'all start going to sleep already i'm coming back here i'm going to stand among you well get me one of them big old whip thing listen this is huh what do you say yeah holy water yeah i listen brother i drowned some people because look hey when they like this you pour water in it would have to pray for them to raise them from the dead but you know what the problem is this has become common to us i'm looking at every one of you it's just become common i've already know this i've heard this for 50 years i've heard this for 20 years this thing you know this is just something we hear all the time and find something to rejoice about i rejoice that i don't have to go through the tribulation but you know what it's not just automatic i got to learn what's in this bible i got to let the holy ghost tell me why i'm not going to go through tribulation and tell me why i'm not going to go through the judgment cause i'm being judged right now and if you're being judged right now where do you stand number one phoenix arizona brother branham let's read the red says redemption is one of the oldest things in the bible did you know redemption was even before the plan of redemption was laid out before the world was ever formed think of that god foreseeing as brother dale's talking about this morning we've we're not beating this to death but i listen i want you to see that by foreknowledge this plan of god and we ever get to it listen this all originated from that seventh dimension that no one can go into but god himself but god allowed a prophet sure he allowed a prophet to go in the sixth dimension amen to see the the dead saints and he said where's jesus he's a little higher but now remember though when brother brown said let's go back into the back part of god's mind in christ the mystery of god reveal he took him into that seventh dimension that is god alone that's where his mind is that's where you can't and you can't make god just being a brain right right this is the mind of god if you're part of the word of god today if you're a born-again believer this is the peace or part of my of the mind of god that was before the foundation of the world thinking about this as it's being revealed so even look god foreseeing and making a way of redemption before he even made the world where god plainly says that christ was predestinated for ordained it was the lamb of god see he was the kingpin he was the one that he had to come and do that because nobody else could do it so he was predestinated eternally he knew he was going to have to die the plan just didn't develop when he got here like i told you many times before the the greatest quote that's an eye-opener in this message is that jesus did not come here to bring you an inheritance in other words he didn't develop an inheritance while he was here no your inheritance was before the foundation of the world and therefore christ had to come here in human flesh to fulfill what he already saw he'll be all right with that he fulfilled what he already saw in the back part of god's mind that mind you know you can't there's no way even though well you're too young well you're to roll somebody's mind bob he's fixing to be 46 years old 40 47 48 90. 46 but still i need somebody in my in my grade level sorry you either buddy but you know we can we can the people that danny's closer than joyce she's way older than all of us but the way we grew up in our culture we understand things that went on you do the same thing like that brother dale tells about having to plow with the mew well how many of us have plowed with a mule one person so that's a generation but now we look at that and we say well that was a generation past but you know it had to be like that's why the analogy i'm using the eternal plan of redemption is god had already thought of this saw it develop because of foreknowledge and then he predetermined as trevor was talking about sunday there's a predetermining of each church age now remember those church ages there was a a city built that had the character of the church age but none of those people were the believers of that age does everybody understand what i'm saying in other words laodicea was a city back in whatever it was a.d something okay but none of us were there but the characteristics of that age of of our age was parallel to that city's characteristic so you know what god's doing he's saying look i had this i saw what they were going to do and i knew they were going to be this way and that's the layout to see an age and this over here is going to be the ephesian age and you know what that was the age that we didn't have a tractor that we were going to plow with we plowed with a mule now we got these great big things that could just hey they've got things that just take this building in about 15 minutes and flatten it to the ground you couldn't do that 100 years ago never what are you saying brother by the advancement of man you see the advancement of god as we were looking at the countdown we see a couple of quotes here on the fourth dimension we were talking about that on the countdown brother branham brings it and we'll read it again if we get a little further he comes to a place and he says we've had an astronaut now we got an astronaut now that has went out to outer space and has come back and told us you know what he was telling us he the prophet of god was able to go into that sixth dimension see what was in there and be able to come back here and say hey there's more out there's more out there and he came to say look there's more in here way more in here than we haven't even touched now brother dale read ephesians 1 so we're not going to read it again because he says according he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world not chosen by him but for him and in him before the foundation of the world all right now look at verse 11 and whom also we obtain an inheritance because see you have to you have to take hold of that inheritance yourself now see sister astra was taught that if you don't if you're not born again hey sister i mean if you're not born again you're lost that's it period you're lost right there's no in-between you're either born again or you're in the process but still being in the process you're not part of the family of god unless you have the baptism of the holy ghost in your soul all right so sister esther had to obtain her inheritance now remember in the mind of god she already had the inheritance in the mind of god like i said before if you read if you read quotes and you can't keep those two separate you get confused that's right because he always was you always were an eagle you always were this that's in the mind of god listen i've read you so how many quotes have i read you you were born a cuckold cuckleber and i don't know if you have those in chile or not do you have a cuckoo bird in chile a sticker how would you say it louise something that sticks you or something a thorn or something like that you were born a thorn you were born that way you were born contrary to god so you had to look and also we have obtained an inheritance what being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will and what is his will his will is his word all right so he did that by foreign knowledge we're just going to skip to a lot of this but let's go to number three and we'll read what the prophet said about being a kuckleberg so but realize if you read the quotes you read all the quotes from brother brown so you always were a wheat you all you came here already eternal you know all these things you have to listen to what he's saying right and the mind of god is already set right down here we are on free moral agency this is free moral agency for everybody so you have to obtain that inheritance but he saw that you would obtain it he saw that last sunday that sister esther had had enough and and look at brother zai you know all the different ones that you have those up and down i mean you know still as a christian we have up and downs but there's not so far up or they're not so far down we have little wiggles in christianity right amen we still have our problems but now when you do when you're up here and you say oh i got it i got it and then the next day you're cursing like a sailor you ain't got it now when you ma when one may run through your mind cause you can't help it that's god's playground and that is the devil's playground but you might have those days where you might want to say it but there's something inside of you that says nope you don't say that i don't do that anymore we've all experienced that amen we've all experienced we all still have the same memories and conscious effects and imagination and we still we still have that same recorder that's been playing since we were a young child right that we wish we would forget what we did but you know what god left that there for a purpose he left that there so that you can every day say father forgive me now listen don't ask for forgiveness for what you did 20 years ago if you've already asked forgiveness you're just wasting your time in god's too because he's going to say what you're talking about because if it's been put in the sea of god's forgetfulness brother brown said if it's been placed under the blood no one can bring it out not even god right thank god god can't bring it back up but now we had to come to a condition as sister esther says she's been up she'd been down she's been this she's been that zach was the same way i was the same way i just used that because he's right here in the front like brother trevor said i'm gonna talk about you because you're sitting on the front row all right but you did the same thing that's your testimony though what if you just what if we did just come into this world i may not get to nothing but we're going to talk about this for a minute we may we come into this world to have a testimony because the plan of redemption hinges on me because if i don't accept it i'm not in the plan amen but if i accept it and become part of the plan then now see that's the mind of god that knew i don't listen i didn't know that one day zach would walk in the in the brothers act would walk in the door walk in the room and have a powerful testimony and then you know brother trevor if he sees this i he didn't tell me not to say nothing about it but he said he was just having a struggle sunday afternoon i said join the crowd all right join the crowd but when he went home he just felt real dejected went home talked to bob but the next monday same same conversation i said don't worry don't let that bother you if you listen if you walk out that door and i'm telling you this is this is something that you should do even in your personal life before you walk out that door before i come out that door i go right over there you know what the first person i see because there's a big old full mirror right here behind this door i look at that mirror and i say god though i be a castaway though i don't feel like preaching though you throw me in hell you give somebody something today now i don't go now lord give all 100 people give give them all a blessing now that'd be happy and that'd be real nice sometimes it might happen i hadn't seen it yet but i said lord though i don't feel like doing this that has nothing to do with it i've studied all week i've run things through my mind and i'm not and listen you don't run things through your mind we're just not going to get in our sermon i don't run things through my mind and say well now now sister christine i know she's got this problem i can see it in the face and i can see it in the way she acts so i'm going to try to preach something that'll just help you can't do that that's right listen as i said before i told some of the young ministers you can't make something happen when you you that's the worst part when you say you or i i'm gonna make something happen this service boy i guarantee you they ain't nobody going to sleep today i'm going to have a message that's going to fire him up i don't know how you translated that it's going to fire him up and then it's just like you ever went down the road and had two flat tires right but you know what you don't let that bother you though because i've prepared all week something doesn't matter if it's just a few words how many times have i told you you're not going to get this whole hour sermon or hour and a half sermon or whatever it is you're going to get 15 minutes of something compressed that you're going to get and say well that helped me how many times ministers we know that you walk outside and people walk by you never say a word nobody says good sermon harley anymore so if it's not it's not that's okay just tell me it's not say i that wasn't good but water but you know one or two persons they'll they'll grab you they'll grab you and they'll say boy see if you had trevor here that day or the day after what you'd say hey brother boy that was for me and me only well you know what that would just change his whole attitude everybody got that same way i told you when we have visitors here that are not message believers how important is it that i keep telling you over and over again i don't care if you've ever said amen or raise your hand in your life that's your business between you and god but please while somebody when somebody's here are visiting and they're not part of they're not message believers and i know these people are message believers but we get people coming here and brother dale kind of got you know he'll move over and start you know talk about water baptism or one of us you know we'll weave it in there somewhere about water baptism and about um trinity the trinitarian doctrine and we just sit there asleep because you know what that person's doing that person is going that man's on an island by himself he must be the only person that believes it because all these other people are not saying anything i'm excited that god sent a prophet i'm excited that all the that all the world is contrary to what i believe what martin luther said he said he said i he said i want the world to know right yeah all the world don't like you martin i want the world to know that i don't like what the world's doing either that's right but does that affect are we so much cuckobers that we just sit there and don't don't have any reaction listen folks we're human being remember what brother brown said that time he saw brother ram i don't want anybody brag on me he said that guy was lying right and he didn't have no have to have no prophetic discernment to realize that we're human beings all of us are human beings right and you know yeah i'd rather donny to come back to me and say hey you need to preach that over again you didn't do a good job that time then for you to say good sermon and then go home and go i don't know what in the world he was saying today what's that got to do with eternal front of redemption i don't know but we'll get back to it in just a second let's look at number three questions and answers but look how can i take a cocker bar and make a grain of wheat out of it it's impossible for me to do it just what i said before quit trying to make things happen if you're if you're studying for something we're getting back into our sunday school class study for something for the kids and don't say when i think you know this is going to be for jonas this day no you've left the whole class out or this is just for brother donny today or no you know what if you got the holy ghost and they got the holy ghost or even if they don't have the holy ghost in the congregation if they have a need and they need something then guess guess what god's going to do he's going to move you over right because we're only going to preach what you take amen that's why we like teaching and we don't have you know i didn't say i don't say we don't like the other things but we we like good teaching because what does teaching do teaching positionally places you in the body as brother dale's talking about going up to adopt to adoption to be placed when you see the the right of adoption watch what happens in galatians it says that you're under tutors and governors now how many of us have been school how many of us have been in school you know what school s-c-h-o-o-l school and we really enjoyed every day of it right especially some of us that was a little mischievous like sister kathy just kidding just kidding i'm sure she wouldn't but that's what god's saying i'm to take you to school and i'm going to give you school teachers school moms i'm going to give you principals now how many of us really liked going in the principal's office i didn't want to know that guy so it's the same way with god for us to go up this statue of a perfect man and get into this adoption that we're talking about which is part of the eternal plan of redemption amen it's part of the eternal plan of redemption because the eternal plan of redemption plan of redemption some group or even just one person has got to come to an adoption to wit the redemption of the body even if it's just one person but you know what if it's not me i don't want to stand in the way i want to rally behind whoever that is but you know what the first thing people do as human beings how many of you played king on the hill do they do that in chile they play king of the hill clint king of the hill i don't somebody's on the very top of the mountain and everybody wants that guy's job so they crawl up there and they throw him down and you get up there and you got to knock the next guy down that's the way it is a lot of times in in the message of the hour you know they all want to be number one i really don't care i think we're in the right message i don't think i know i know we're in the right message i know we're in the right place to hear what we need to hear i don't care who's on the hill if god put somebody on the hill you're not gonna knock him off anyway hey man if god places somebody you're not gonna knock them off same way with adoption i'm praying that somebody comes to that place are you well we don't have to worry about these viruses and have to wear a mask and after all this stuff there's going to come a place to where brother branham said we will speak and it'll be like popcorn popping pop pop pop in other words things are gonna happen but it's not gonna happen if we don't have the new birth number one and it's not gonna happen if we don't if we say well i always was this great thing see you've put yourself on top of the hill let god put you up there god's got you in his mind already up there you just don't know it that's why you and i that's why we preach the gospel we say boy we got we got old brother zach today you'll see his eyes he's and no so-and-so over here on this side of the church he's sound sleep well it might be the totally opposite because you know what you're not doing the work god's doing the work so you let god do the work right but how can i change take a huckleberry and make a grain of wheat you can't do that brother bob how many times have you tried to get your two oldest to be oh bro to be wheat i'm gonna y'all both got up here you you've been up i'm picking on you but you know what i'm proud of you that we can say you have become a wheat yes your mom and daddy tried to beat the kuckleberg out of you didn't he and mama maybe but really didn't i mean mama tried to save me for 30 years didn't happen because you can't do it you can pray but you know one day in 1998 it became possible by the transforming power of god to change me from my old kookaburra to the new creature in christ so see the mind of god that i always was weak manifested itself on earth just like the mind of god said i've got to go die and become the lamb's flame before the foundation of the world so i can cover everything and everybody but one day 2 000 years ago next week on sunday what we consider easter he produced what he saw before the foundation of the world and he had to wait for how old are you 18 never mind he had to wait some age of accountability maybe nine years on but you know what to god it was just like this he knew that but we're down here though mom and daddy's struggling mama's praying daddy's praying aunt and uncle's praying everybody's praying and god's going i know but you know sometimes he'll drop a seed in every once in a while he'll drop a word in there and it'll settle in you your you your parents heart that my kids are okay i mean they're not okay like they are but they're coming right amen but you need to realize that though that god will speak to you i told you this year please this year whatever you got inside of you and i mean that truthfully whatever you got inside of you you need to let it out good or bad see you let the bat out and let the good in that same way when you and i this year let that thing that's inside of you speak to you because it is the you are a part of the eternal plan of redemption sure you've still got a cuckold bear on the outside sure we get tired and we get frustrated but like i said before our ups and downs are not like the world's ups and downs folks like brother dale said this morning you better be know you've settled in god once you know you're settled in god death's not even gonna harm you oh yeah we have that little fog or cloud that we think well i don't want to leave my loved ones or uh you know i don't know what they're gonna do when i'm gone not up to you it's not up to you to pick your day god does but you know what you can keep pressing and keep pressing and keep pressing doesn't matter how old you get or how bad you feel you keep pressing and you're saying i'm going to be that one i'm going to be that one that's going to stand abraham said hey here i am lord i can't do it myself i've done walked with you for 20 something years i hadn't produced a child got worse as it is but now i've met you see esther met melchizedek last sunday and not that's not that flesh melchizedek you understand what i mean we we've been taught right it's not that melchizedek that milk has it couldn't save you but the theophany that was in that milk has it that met abraham it's the same melchizedek that came down in your house that your dog got scared of let nature proclaim let nature proclaim that god can come down into this dimension any time he wants to and he'll change you from a cuckover to a wheat and he's the only one who can do it what john say john said if this don't happen the rocks are going to cry out if you keep silent blew the church the rocks are going to cry out because there's been a life of wheat put in that kookaburra and the life of the kuckelber has been taken out thank god and he's the only one that can do it because you know what when god makes you a wheat satan cannot ever make you a huckleberry again he can never make you a huckleberry again he can pound on you he can beat on you he can beat on that shell that you got on the outside but he'll never ever for an eternity touch your soul he takes his greasy hands off of you can't make you go in the fifth dimension that's what gets me about people you see what you got inside of you by the new birth you got a free ticket to glory but if you do have to pass away and you're laying on your deathbed everybody worries about that death angel i don't worry about it what's coming to get me is not a black guy in a robe that they proclaim that he's got a skeleton and he says i'm coming to get you no no no no that's not what's gonna happen god's gonna send the angels and he they're going to walk in and they're going to say no death angel you need to turn around and go back to where you're going they know death in this guy you may take that to the grave but we're going to a place that you know what when they step into that faster dimension satan don't even know he doesn't know anything about that he ain't got his greasy hands in that now listen i don't i don't see how but he can go in the seventh dimension where god is and talk to him remember that we know that he's the accuser of the brethren so he goes up and talks to god but that sixth dimension brother bob he can never i don't think he even knows where it's at i don't think he's privileged to even see in that dimension i'm sure one day in 1960 he was standing there in the fourth dimension scratching his head going why is this man laying on the bed and i can't see a soul nowhere hello there's a man laying here i see the huckleberry but where's his soul well god just slipped him over into another dimension and let him see the saints didn't have to worry about the devil the devil wasn't sniffing at his heels but he knew if he went back and got in that body the devil would be sniffing at his heels again but not when he was in the sixth dimension so in the sixth dimension is where we go if we have to pass away so let's skip to that real quick right there because we talked about paradise and i want to cover this you all know we went through the first the four dimensions the fourth dimension being radio waves and all these different things and then we talked about the fifth dimension which is the sin or dead which they're not burning in hell they're they're not they have not been judged yet they have just been caught in a place that they can't go to heaven or go to the sixth dimension and they can't come back here to the earth they have to go to a place of holding that's like a nightmare that you can't wake up from in the fifth th that's the fifth dimension everybody got that saved man kind of strange there was a there was a group called the fifth dimension remember brother claude preaching on that and they saw they they sang the age of aquarius which is the water boy or the man the son of man kind of interesting you know what the devil though the devil feels all these religious things and he perverts them and make them out in the world like trevor was talking about sunday about all these superheroes where they get all that from where they get superman and that's totally it ain't gonna happen right but the devil wants you to think it can happen on the earth that there's some little there's some you can get bit by um sorry electronic get bit by um a spider that's been in come on people you see how all this superman you know he comes from kryptonite and he does it i mean he comes from krypton and kryptonite's the one that bothers him see what the devil's doing he's diverting everybody's attention to that and it's not even real right right not even real but it seems real to the people that are like oh man he he died yesterday and come back to life or he conquered the world or he he moved the mountain well i thought that was left for us to do i thought that was a christian could say by the bible that if you have the grain of a mustard seed that you can have enough faith to move a mountain one grain of mustard seed you don't have to have your planet explode or or a or a spider about you that's been i can't remember where oh radiation a radioactive spider has bit you and now you can shoot things from you know whatever you see how satan knows wanting to change i was thinking about that when he was saying satan's wanting to change all that unreal to real unreal to the real and then seeing and they become a god in the movie industry because they can kill a guy and bring him back to life and they can have him disappear and reappear and they can have him walk through walls you see what he's doing but he's doing it though because there's a fourth dimension that he can work through right he's a fourth dimension that he can work through then we talk about the fifth dimension which was hell but not burning then we got to the sixth dimension so let's if y'all skip to that one we'll go to that one and then we'll not be real long today i want to read a real long quote here in a minute but everybody all right the sixth dimension on the countdown brother brown says now the sixth dimension is christ the saints dead saints or resting saints who is completely work finished on earth you see i don't want to be here for god if god's finished with any of us we want to go you pray for 15 more years you'll be like who was it you died he just made him he just made a mess of the last 15 years that god gave me but he wasn't ready to die is what his problem was he wanted to stay alive what oh work finished on earth and has entered into rest with christ under the altar beautifully you could parallel it like a wonderful dream now you paralleled the other one like a like another like a dream you didn't want to go to the fifth dimension to a dreamlike place the sixth dimension but he said look it's a wonderful dream that you don't want to wake up from it ain't a dream it's natural it's real but i'm just making a parable for you of course the seventh dimension is god alone now i want to clear up something real quick we talk about paradise and we talk about the dead saints raising and i want to tell you just like brother branham tells us somebody asked him where enoch was he said i'm going to tell you i don't know that's what he said i don't know and if he didn't know i sure ain't going to know but if he would if he was supposed to know and tell us and it become a part of the message of the hour god would have sent it i'm going to tell you folks brother adam's message did not leave stuff out we'll see a lot of people say well there was a lot left out and we got to fill it in hogwash baloney baloney because rapturing faith lies in the books and tape so what we got to do is is we got to get it out of there and present it to the people the way that it's supposed to be presented by the fifo ministry to perfect the saints just as the bible tells us but look whatever i'm going to read this scripture because some people say well some when the dead saints resurrected they come in their glorified bodies and listen we got some scriptures we got to deal with hebrews 11 40 says they without us cannot be made perfect now what is perfection to a to a believer it's not just your soul right am i okay it's not just your soul perfection in the believer is immortality which means you were mortal and now you are immortal everybody got that and i'm going to read you a scripture here in a few minutes where the bible says that that that he's the only one that's reached immortality so there's two scriptures that tells me one thing for sure the only person from adam to the to this day that's walking around in a glorified immortal body is jesus christ now there's others put in slots you've got um moses and elijah and you got enoch and those different ones is everybody okay with that but as we read this the people that came up from paradise they can't be in immortal bodies or you're breaking two scriptures why could brother branham not go to the seventh dimension because he had not become immortal yet the seventh dimension there's a man in that dimension that has come to this dimension died rose again ascended sent back to holy ghost amen but he is in another place because brother branham will read it when he went across the curtain of time he said where's jesus he said he's higher right you can't see him but when you get ready to come back to earth you're going to get he's going to judge you we'll read it you'll be gathered with your people remember paul wasn't in paul's in the sixth dimension no doubt but he wasn't in the dimension brother branham was in or he'd have seen him everybody got that we'll read it in a minute because why would brother brown say did paul make it well now if you're in a sixth dimension that's got millions of of people in it and and paul kind of got lost in the crowd somewhere over there no he's in a separate place because he said you'll be gathered with your people okay paul was gathered with his people irenaeus was gathered what not irene and it is irenaeus himself but it's irenius it's believers it's the ones that died under irena's message that's why you don't negate any church age messenger because they were all important they all brought one message from god and they were put in that slot when they died because listen i'm going to say this the dimension that those people are in now in the sixth dimension with brother branham sitting in there now they're a special group of people they got the last message of the hour they got they are it says bible says the last to be first and the first to be last so they are going to come up first and we which are alive and remain the bible says will never be alive and remain without what that prophet said that sitting in that sixth dimension right we're not going to get another messenger we're not going to get another great preacher to rise up somebody get up on the mountain again this is it we're all equal in the body of christ we have a five-fold ministry that has a special gift but there's no one special person anymore that we got to look to for our absolute amen so the sixth dimension then is a special place for the believers that died in christ because remember also we looked at paradise last time and let's read this real quick in luke 23 verse 42 then we're going about an hour so we're good and he sent us and he said unto jesus well right under paradise we kind of skipped through a lot of this remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom and jesus said unto him verily i say unto thee today shalt thou be with me he didn't say in my kingdom because remember he had some parts to play and things to do to establish his kingdom because his kingdom is the baptism of the holy ghost amen the new birth is the kingdom of god right that was the promise that's day without us cannot be made perfect hebrews 11 about 30 something says they all had a good report but not receiving the promise amen that's why everybody in everybody in the old testament no one got the new birth i proved that we talked about it we were reading paradise brother brown said they had to go in a certain place they couldn't go in the sixth dimension now where they went they went somewhere a place of holding bosom of abraham paradise but now paradise is emptied up and they're waiting somewhere to have their body glorified or changed everybody okay with that they don't i don't believe they're walking around in their glorified body right now right if not then the two scriptures you've got to pass those two scriptures we're fixing to read that there's only one man received immortality and that's the king potentate king of kings and lord of lords all right so you say where are they it's not going to bother me to find out they were but i just don't see how that they can be made perfect that's why i said i can't see how the woman at the well got the new birth before jesus died i don't see how the woman at the well got the baptism of the holy ghost in her soul and made her eternal before i did or before the before the 120 in the upper room did that's right not me the 120 up room i can't see that you understand i mean jesus even went to the disciples said receive ye the holy ghost now remember the bible even tells us that was a promise they didn't receive it right then that was a promise that on the day of pentecost they would receive it all right so paradise he said today thou shalt be with me in paradise now let's read one or two quotes of this if you don't mind number 12 just keep going thank you brothers now this witch of endor this is demonology in 1953 she called up the spirit of samuel and saul talked to samuel now you might wonder how that could be done it cannot be done today everybody see that brother branham says it cannot be done today no sir because the blood of bulls and goats was only a waiting for the time of fulfillment when a man died in those days preachers backed me up if you think is right when a man died he died under the atonement of an animal and his soul went into paradise and there he stayed until that the day of redemption and his soul was in there it's theophany because your soul is your theophany right right now watch demonology again number 13. i can see jesus go up there paradise there's old abraham isaac and jacob and them and there samuel and all the rest of them i can hear him knocking the door oh i love this it gets me right feel kind of religious now i can see look over there and hear who is that who is there this is abraham talking who is it i'm the seed of abraham amen i can see abraham come to the door to open the door he said i'm the seed of abraham look each one saw jesus christ in theophany form but they saw him in the revelation that they saw him in the old testament because look daniel said look here there's the stone now look we read it as the stone being hewed out of a mountain not made with hands and destroying the kingdom who was that that was jesus christ destroying what destroying the kingdom here now look and abraham there's one place where abraham says oh look sarah there's the man that that we fed the calf to so in his theophany he looked just like melchizedek i can hear the people say there he is i've seen him like dust under his feet clouds moving now this is ezekiel when the rams clapped their hands the leaves and all shouted oh i can see the different ones there in paradise waiting for him i can hear him say see i can hear job say without that i can hear job say there's my redeemer there's the one that's talked to me there's the one that spoke to me when i was down and out and all those different things there's the guy he's a never changing god but look they didn't ever see him as a person they saw him in the revelation for the time they had ezekiel the wheel in the middle of the wheel daniel saw him as the ancient of days but when he went down to paradise to pick him up they had a clarity they had clarity about who he was because you know what they knew they were already passed on they knew they were in a place of holding waiting a time that he was going to come and then there he opens the door well it might not have been a real door but it was a dimensional thing jesus stepped in that dimension and said here i am he had already been to the souls that preached in hell so he'd already been down there preaching to them i'm the one that that noah preached about for 120 years that you turned me down but he didn't stay there he grabbed the keys from satan and went up to the next dimension went to paradise open up the doors i can hear him say come on it's breaking daylight over in jerusalem you got to get out of here we're going up because you trusted in the blood of bulls and ghosts waiting for the time that my blood say but my blood's been shed up yonder on calvary i am the incarnate son of god all sin debt is paid we're on the road out hallelujah glory to god and you see abraham grabs sarah by the arm and here they come now look not old no more that was abraham and sarah yeah not old no more we were talking about that before we read where samuel was brought up out of paradise by the witch of endor and what happened he was still in his prophet robe and he still looked like samuel did because he'd only been dead two years brother brown says he'd been dead two years and he still looked the same so what paradise is different from the sixth dimension to me paradise you stu you were stuck in what you were in everybody understand that i don't believe the people in the fifth dimension are in young bodies see what i mean they're in the body they send in they're in there in the theophany that and whatever place it was that's where they're at and the condition they're in that's what they are because they got to come back here too and pick up their body that they send them and stand before the white throne judgment because they sure they send in their soul but they sin in that body that body's got to be destroyed the same way as the soul everybody got that saying ma'am that was too fast i'm sorry let's read number 14. so we got to get done with this here he comes climbing up brother she's coming daylight i can see the big morning star looking around the grave already it's coming on the third day hallelujah the first wait he's got somebody else over in paradise he don't forget nobody pass me not old gentle savior hear my humble cry over here in paradise lay some souls abraham isaac jacob sarah and those who've been faithful believing the promise of the prophet see he's going through hebrews 11. all the great men of faith but remember they had faith in what that he was coming now look we're on this side not having faith he's come coming he's here amen who've been faithful believing the promise of what the prophets and they're laying there waiting with only the blood of bulls and goats a shadow a type of his own blood i can see him go up paradise knock on the door abraham opens the door who are you i'm the seed of abraham i can hear daniel what the stone i've seen hewed out of the mountain without hands i can hear ezekiel so i'm coming with such speed to look like powerful with dust under his feet oh my i can hear the prophets say i wrestled with him all night that's jacob right wrestled with him all night down at the river before i crossed and this is the part i want you to see john the different ones recognize him so john recognized him he said behold the lamb of god that took away the sin of the world he said i see the results of that right i remember he got his head cut off before jesus died so he was over in paradise waiting the time just about 15 minutes before time with graves going to open up my righteous blood has been shed for you you were waiting on me under the blood of goats and bulls which could not take you into the presence of the father but i've shed my blood to take it away now we're on our road home questions and answers number 15. look jesus told his disciples taking their communion he said i'll eat no more the fruit of the vine until i eat it and drink it with you and you and my father's kingdom is that right so we when the dead dies a justified person standing in the presence of god goes into the presence as an immortal being now look immortal be not an immortal totally immortal immortal means that you were once mortal and now you're immortal because remember whatever souls in the fifth dimension whatever soul's in the sixth dimension they don't have their body they were born in hello the body's in the grave you don't take the body with you the body stays in the grave it's just the soul the soul is immortal you get born again your soul becomes immortal takes you into what heavenly places standing in the presence of god goes into his presence as an immortal immoral immoral excuse me immortal being and lives in the blessed realms of peace what until the day that he returns back now there was a time that the people didn't go into the presence of god when they died why blood of bulls and ghosts they weren't born again the justified that was in the old testament they went into a place called paradise and they're the souls of the just waited in paradise the paradise was a place where god kept the souls in like a dreamland until the blood of jesus christ was shed for the blood of bulls and goats would not take away sin it only covered up sin but jesus blood takes away sin you notice that his when he died at calvary and on his return he brought out from the grave those dead saints that had died under the atonement of blood of bulls goats and heifers let's read this rapture nut number 16. the old testament saints has gone into his presence presence paradise done away he's taken the order of the rapture paradise done away and the old testament saints ascended up at his loud voice when he screamed and gave up the ghost because why the sacrifice the propitiation of their sins that they had waited on believed that perfect lamb was coming they had offered the sacrifice the lamb and when he died and yielded up the ghost he screamed with a loud voice and the old testament saints awoke watched the shout the voice the same thing it is coming yielded up the ghost and when he did the sacrifice was perfect paradise was emptied out in the old testament saints came to the earth walked around on earth and entered into him at his rapture now i believe that because that's what the prophet said but they weren't in a human body no no one in the human body they weren't a theophany body the same one that they were in there they weren't theophany body everybody got that all right david said over there lift up the everlasting gates be lifted up he led captivity captive gave gifts to men and the old testament saints went in with him now where'd they go as my point was the other day where did they go because they didn't go to the future home homes not for them that's for us so they're in a place of waiting in a city because it's got gates but when brother rome went in the sixth dimension he didn't see that right he saw the saints that were like he said there was just plains and valleys and hills pla plains you know what i mean not airplanes lord don't get that started everybody everybody goes i'm glad he explained that no airplanes okay in the sixth dimension you will not need an airplane coming back here you will not need an airplane i don't know how that got started well i do the devil got that started but anyway there's in other words it was a it was not even a city he never recorded there was a city he just said people came running over the hills and and and hugged him and said god bless you my brother god bless you my brother so they're in a place of waiting they're in a holding place just like the new the old testament saints they're in a place to wait lift up the everlasting gates and be lifted up he led captivity captive give gifts unto men the old testament saints went in with him they said who is this king of righteousness the lord of glory mighty and host mighty host here they come in marching jesus led captivity captive now remember it that had to be set just for the old testament saints because that six dimension people are not in that group we're talking about paradise the only the first person that went into the sixth dimension after jesus came back on the day of pentecost was was stephen brother brown said he was the first martyr right he was the first one that went into that sixth dimension he wasn't lonely after that either they just kept killing every one of them amen but remember john wasn't in that group john the baptist was not now we know john the revelator was but john the baptist was not in that group he's in this group of the old testament saints everybody got that the lord mighty in battle the gates flew open and jesus conquered led captivity captive then they had believed on him and the word had come to them there the old testament saints laying there waiting he led captive captive captivity captain ascended on high took the old testament saints and went in there is one rapture already passed he was proven there's a rapture you know in the old testament and because that was an old testament rapture that wasn't a new testament rapture that was an old testament rapture got that the new testament rapture is happening in just hopefully in days weeks or months some of y'all's already happened the dead in christ shall rise first number 17. and now in this vision i believe i was caught up to that sixth dimension we're going to cover that just for a minute looking back down here and could see back see the sight isn't exactly with the eyes that's earthly but sight is a greater thing than the sight that they have there see they didn't lose their five senses they just had a greater sense the sight that they have there their contact is far beyond any contact that our natural senses would contact because remember and you may not like this but i'm going to tell you something brother branham was the prophet of the age but when he went across the curtain of time they were telling him where he was at what he was doing he was a leader and when he's why he's got to go back so they and even sharon rose was there as a young lady i gotta wait here on billy you go see mama and even his first wife that had died didn't even recognize him as her husband nope i'll read it to you this is kind of long i'm going to read it though and we'll be done here in just a second then y'all go find something that makes you happy and you stay awake for that having conferences chocolate ohio and something happened i felt myself leaving this body now i never had a vision like that i looking back seeing myself lying there leaning up against the headboard of the bed with my hands up he was back there doing this wasn't like no he was thinking remember he was saying lord and then he i'll cut a part of that out because he thought media was talking to him he said honey you're talking to me and he said she said uh she was sound asleep you know so leave me alone but it wasn't for her it was for him and i looked at myself and i thought i'm dying and i started moving out the first thing you know i come into a little place that kind of said something like that and as soon as i got there here come thousands of people and everybody looked young now i'm in a mixed multitude i'm your brother and you watch i say this in the name of the lord you'll each meet me there if you'll be right one of these people say brother branham you know what he's just he's the biggest liar that ever lived or he's the greatest man that ever lived beside jesus christ you got to make that choice because the people that turn this message down they have to turn this down every time brother brown says i've got the bible laying before me and i'll meet it at judgment now if he's as wrong as they say he's wrong that boy is going to split hell wide open and he will not i'll promise you that he won't be the one that does it because he was telling the god's honest truth amen you say whatever you want to about dates and times whatever he gave he gave us the pure message for this hour now but these young girls coming to me throwing their arms around me and hollering my precious brother now look when i was a sinner i never run around i was an artery to run around with women i don't care how saintly a man tries to live and how godly he lives if a woman puts his arm around a man it's a human sensation now you just might as well i don't care you can call yourself sanctified and i believe in sanctification too but you're still a human and exactly right and there's a sensation look he says i don't say you'd do wrong certainly not the power of god keeps you and you go on but even in that place that human cessation wasn't there and here comes people just throwing their arms around saying my precious brother and all the women had long hair white garments barefooted they were young look at me about 18 20 years old they grabbed me and thrown arms around me said oh our precious brother and just hug me like that and walk away and somebody else i seen my first wife which is what hope right i see my first wife come up now she died when she was about 22. she hadn't changed he recognized her because she died at that age that they were in that dimension because remember he couldn't recognize sharon rose because he said in other words who are you said daddy daddy he she was a six month old baby when he saw her last thank god that he showed us all this and my first wife came up now she died when she was about 20 22. she hadn't changed she came running i said surely she'll call me husband and she walked up she began smiling throw her arms around me she said my darling brother then she hugged some woman that had just hugged me some girl so something in there is is is lacking that that they don't have their full consciousness because remember he has another dream that sharon wrote i mean that hope grabs this arm and media grabs this arm and they know that they were married to him and they walk up into paradise or in we can call paradise listen we can call paradise what we're going to but i'm not i'm not now i've left the paradise though that god set for the people in the old testament i've left that but we are going to the paradises of god amen because paradise means a wonderful place all right so look and here come people just throwing their arms around me saying my precious brother and all the women had long hair now look at um e68 and here come men looks like they somebody somebody um i quoted this and and i knew i'd read it i think it was brother timbo he's not here but he said where'd brother brown say that we'd have shaggy long hair well read it for yourself and here come men look like they were in kind of shaggy hair down on their shoulder that's when cuckoo burn wheat becomes weak you cuck a burn now don't walk in here with no shaggy long hair down to your shoulder unless you got a nazarite vow which means well you know what it all means if you can do that god bless you have it to your down to your waist i don't care but you can't do it not not if you've been married you can't do it hello somebody shag your hair down on their shoulders because look it's all been done away with there all the sexual stuff and all that's what brother i'm saying he said then women just hugging him and they must have felt like women but there was no sensation there because you know what you don't lose your body you have your uh your theophany is what you are all right here come men look like where were kind of shaggy hair down on their shoulder and they were the nicest looking people i ever seen eyes were starry pearly white teeth thank god no dentist in glory right sister after right everybody's had teeth work done they were throwing their arms around me saying oh our precious brother and one of them hollered at the other one said think he's arrived he's arrived at last they were looking for him to come right they were looking for it they had to be some kind of connection there some kind of pull from this dimension to that dimension for them to know he's arrived at last and i thought have i died and this is i've come into glory is this it i thought it couldn't be because remember his revelation before that was is that he would be on a cloud brother neville would be on the cloud and they would just pass each other and he said their hand wouldn't be able to shake hands remember the old thing where we all want to play harps and sit on the cloud and play hard i'm in trouble our brother back there he might be able to play one but i i'm you know i want to be able to throw my arms around somebody because that's what it that we're humans they were throwing their arms around me saying oh our precious brother and one of them hollered and think he's arrived he's arrived at last and i thought if i and i looked and that voice that it spoke to me down in my room i heard it again i looked back and i see myself laying there on the bed i never had anything like that to happen it's done something to me i can never be the same no more i looked i thought what is this i thought well all them people looking young and i looked down and i was young if you're born again today and now the older people need to start running the aisles well walk in the aisles maybe but if you're born again today and i'm not being silly your soul is a 20 year old soul you when you got you got changed you got a new birth when he birthed you he birthed you back to a young man and woman it's just the cuckoo birds got to get changed what is this i thought well all then people look young i looked down i was young i had turned back to a young man again i said well this is strange and i looked i can't explain it there's no words that i can think of if i'd say superb or sublime or perfect that wouldn't touch it there was no tomorrow there was no yesterday there they were in eternity and they never got tired they never had to eat yet they had senses i could feel them they could speak they were looking at me they had senses i said i don't understand this that voice says this is perfect love isn't that what you spoke the holy ghost holy spirit was i said yes and this is perfect love so everybody in that dimension had perfect love which was the baptism of the holy ghost the new birth and just then a beautiful young woman ran up and said oh my darling brother she said we're so happy to see you welcome and she walked away i said praise the lord sister i looked around then i thought what is this now he didn't know who she was who was this i thought what is this what's going on what happened the voice said in the bible where it said that jacob was gathered with his people and the other one this is like and unto that where you'll gather with your where you will gather with your people i said all them branhams i never believed there was that many he said they're not brandons they're your converts they're your converts said that woman that you're admiring you know how old she was when you let her to christ i said i have no idea he said past 90. said see she's young forever and she looked up at me and said brother branham jesus will come someday and then we'll go back to earth said then we'll receive our glorified body then we'll live together forever she had pretty good revelation a little bit better than the prophet had at that moment in time boy it didn't go over good well i'm just reading what he said right oh let me see jesus oh you was a leader you led us oh let me see jesus if i passed over i want to see him and that voice said you can't see him now he will come and be first you know why i couldn't see him number one he was looking at his body right there that sixth dimension is the body of the believers the body of jesus christ you're the body of jesus christ not your human body your glorified body and that voice said you can't see him now said he will come but first he will come to you and said judge you by the gospel you preached and then i i took the part out save time he said well did paul make it the angel said paul made it he said well glory to god i'll make it too cause i preach just what paul preached all right amen let's read this one right here real quick number 19. i know a little bit long but you know if you're going to sleep i'm going to preach a little longer it won't belong to you because you'll be gone for 20-30 minutes the achievement's been proved by science you know there's a brother who's that brother telling me the other day his brother watches us online luis told me and his uh remember i won one service i told y'all to wake up that's his ringtone that when somebody calls him on his phone he chases he puts it right louie yeah he put that on his realm yeah wake up it's only been 15 minutes that's his ringtone when somebody calls him wake up i'm famous i know some of you want me to be an emoji but i wouldn't want to see it the achievement's been proved by science they showed it out yonder at the world's fair now watch he's preaching the countdown we got it amen is being proved everywhere astronaut age we're living in it was made of things which do not appear so about the creation of the world see it was made of something out of heaven it's god himself here in that sixth dimension it's the power of god we've been in such a place to we have been lifted up into that dimension beyond this thing of going to the grave and weeping he's talking about himself but he's talking about an astronaut has been taken to a place a dimension he's the one that went in the sixth dimension we'll see them there now look they slitched up on me here oh right there thank you this thing i'm putting the crepe on the doorknob and saying goodbye forever hallelujah we done got in the astronaut and sailed off out yonder and seen where it's at and look and return back glory we're going to the home beyond the sky yonder beyond the reasoning of man how the old will be transformed into the moment of twinkling of an eye we shall see them there old men and women young again how do you know the bible teaches it and god shot an astronaut up in there we know what it's all about and come back there's no worry about dying remember he said afterwards he said i'm not gonna worry about dying no more dying's nothing sure it's living yes sir it's just getting your feet off the ground so we can go how wonderful so that we can go i want to read two scriptures to you real quick and we'll be done because we'll get into the seventh dimension later on because remember the seventh dimension is what god alone all right first timothy 6 verse 15 says which in his time he shall show who is the blessed and only potentate the king of kings and lord of lords now look it's capital k lower case k capital l lower case he's talking about us transfer transforming from mortal to immortality look verse 16 who only hath immortality now what does immortality mean that means you were once mortal see the angels can't say that satan can't say that satan cannot be immortal he was never immortal to begin with angels were never mortals to begin with but you and i were mortals everybody that's gonna die that's lived on this earth look is either in the fifth dimension or sixth dimension are still alive in the first three amen there's nothing else there's no peripheral there's no other universe that we've got people on i don't believe that who only hath immortality dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto so the seventh dimension is only jesus christ because he was once a mortal and now he's become immortal everybody got that whom no man hath seen nor can see you know why brother brown couldn't see him because of that scripture right there he was barred from seeing him by that scripture right there to whom be honor and power everlasting amen let's read second timothy 1 verse 9 who has saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his what own purpose and grace sounds like ephesians 1 which was given us what in christ jesus before the world began but is now made manifest by the appearing of our savior jesus christ who has abolished death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel a way that you and i can become immortal is only through the gospel the preaching of the gospel by the five-fold ministry that's the only way you don't become immortal you can't press play and become immortal part of it but not all of it let's stand our feet musicians come we're gonna sing one song who's michael you coming okay we'll sing one song it's four o'clock god bless you we love you pray for us this next week next weekend we're gonna be at brother chris's for about five days so we'll be having a little time of fellowship out there but just pray for us with our plane flight and all that stuff keep us safe by the grace of god amen you love the lord listen you're part of the plan listen you're part of the plan whether you want to be or not because there's a place for the fifth dimension people amen you just got to what you've got to obtain an inheritance you've got to do like sister esther said you've got to just say i'm tired i'm sick and tired of being sick and tired now listen we all have troubles and heartaches we know that like i said before but listen they should not be like what we had out in the world then you don't have nobody to talk to you talking to the same dude that made you that way i'm talking about the devil but our ups and downs can't be like they were before look at that chaos that's going on out there in the world read some of the stuff that's going on out there in the world and they say they're normal listen we got a transgender by the stupid people that we somebody elected have got a transgender woman man as our health director she was an ugly man she's the worst ugly woman but i'm just saying listen god's gonna have to raise sodom and gomorrah and totally apologize if he don't destroy this nation and what that person's trying to do is instigate that we give our kids have you read about this a puberty pill to keep them from going through puberty so they can decide what sex they are uh-huh y'all look at each other if you want to but that's exactly you read your you read the write paper don't read the stupid stuff you're reading amen go read what australia is saying about the united states the biggest idiot of a president that's ever been in the face of the earth can't even hold a press conference and here we are great america i think we're so great the only great thing people is god but see you see what they're going to do though if they start requiring that you do that to your children you better never do that they're requiring they're they don't not yet but they're talking about it doing some kind of hormone replacement and waiting for your kids to come of an age where they can decide whether they want to be a man or a woman that's insanity if brother branham said we were that far from insanity we have went all the way over on the other side and made a circle all the way back but that's what we're looking at so they're calling us abnormal because we're christians and we're we have calm in the storm and we we don't talk about all that stuff and and you know we do have problems we do have we do have everybody's got issues we're human but your issues should not dictate your christianity your christianity should dictate your issues you want me to say that one more time like something like listen i and i i agree 100 we should be careful but listen there's some people that ain't gonna darken these doors again just because of this virus they're gonna they're gonna say it's an excuse from now till the day that jesus comes sorry but that's just the way it is but you know what it's separating time it's to find out whether you'll make gonna make it or not gonna make it we're gonna make it amen we're going to make it somebody's going to make it i'm just dumb enough to attach myself to it amen i just think that we've come to a time that right now is a decision time you're going to have to decide this year who you gonna serve because it's gonna get worse not better we see all these policies and stuff coming up we may not even be able to meet in six months who knows that right we don't know they're taking away our guns i really don't care you know what because i believe in jesus christ not an assault rifle okay but i still like my hunting guns where i go hunting when i want to that's my that's a that's a right that's not a privilege i have a right to do that amen get off of that sing a song just start singing a song while i'm doing that touching jesus is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] and [Music] if you need a touch from the lord because touching jesus yes lord just think about where you came from and what you are now [Music] cause touching jesus is all that really matters then your life will never be the same and touches our sisters lord that it will do exactly what it said it would do lord that by your stripes were already healed and evil spirits that will go away from where they are lord we thank you lord we can do this in jesus name we pray amen thank you thank you sing it one more time that really matters and your life will never be the same there is only one way to touch him and you know you think about all those people in the old testament see we can look back and we can see that the savior died we know that jesus christ came and we but still we have to believe it by faith because we didn't see it physically with our physical eyes but they had to believe it a virgin shall conceive back in before before you know be in the bc they had to believe all that and they died having a good report the bible says what believing that there was one coming ezekiel said i know that that will is coming i know daniel said i know that ancient of days is coming even david in the psalms i'm sure he in his revelation saw jesus christ but when they saw that person they identified exactly who he was when you and i receive the new birth you ought to be able to identify that person that comes to you because he's not going to just come to you he's going to live in you and that's like the song says your life will never be the same but there's only one way to touch him and that's believe when you call on his name let's let's uh as we dismissed our brother and sister god bless them thank you for coming thank you for sharing your time with us thank you for coming by our way maybe we'll try to get your way sometime amen and get to visit with them if not then you know what we'll have a thousand years in the millennium we'll get to we can visit for a thousand years so that's gonna be hard for aaron to do that a thousand years but maybe when we get into eternity but remember him he'll be speaking wednesday night and then we'll be off on the journey wherever they're getting ready to go you're going back home now or no we will continue to go into tennessee jeffersonville salt lake city utah we gotta really pray for this man maybe you can teach those people out there something amen but let's pray for them they're going to travel around the united states and see this great country and and listen it is a great country as far as the country but politics is just dead rotten and we've let it somehow worm its way into our lives where i thought we'd come over here to get away from that so uh our founding fathers george washington and all them would turn over in their grave if they saw what was going on now but you know you what you pray for your pastor that's the most important person you need to pray for pray for your pastor and the spiritual leaders in the church because them you ought to be able to depend on everything else you can't depend on that's right you can depend on nothing else amen so let's bow our heads remember brother aaron like i said brother dale brother bob next weekend the heavenly father we praise your great name lord we thank you that you've given this time that we are be are being able to stand in front of the bride of jesus christ the most important people on the face of the earth today at this moment lord and i pray that you just bless each one lord that goes from this building lord is the wheel's turn lord may you be with him also be with our brother and sister and their wonderful family as they travel around the united states lord give them shelter give them peace lord and may everything work out well and then return back home we'll be saved father we ask you blessings and ones that are sick ones that are not with us lord we pray that we'll all get a rejuvenation from the holy ghost lord this tonight and tomorrow morning as we go back out in the world and and not in the world but we go out there and we have to rub shoulders with the devil but lord you told us that we had a hiding place we had a pavilion as sister esther read that scripture the lord we have a place to run into to hide and that's in you father thank you for all these things you've given us thank you for the word you give us the shield and the sword and all the different armor pieces that we can fight lord with you give us something to fight with and that's the word of god father just be with a pastor keep him strong bless each one this whole week be with the ones surely lord that are sick they haven't been here in a while we pray that you just rejuvenate them and bring them back together in you the father we ask these things in the name of jesus christ and the bride of jesus christ says amen god bless you you're dismissed
