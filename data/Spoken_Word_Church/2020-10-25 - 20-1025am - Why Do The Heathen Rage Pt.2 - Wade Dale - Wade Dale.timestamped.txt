[1:06] the other day and
[1:10] it's just the separation time and
[1:13] but we know that
[1:16] we had a prophet go back into the cur
[1:18] across the curtain of time and he just
[1:19] kind of wiped out all fear
[1:23] all fear of death of what's going of
[1:26] what's going to happen with that little
[1:28] sting
[1:30] if so that happens

[1:48] help of anyone
[1:50] and we appreciate the lord for letting
[1:52] us have another week another time
[1:54] another time to come to service
[1:56] i i say smiling faces but
[1:59] some of you i can't see
[2:01] so make your eyes smile
[2:03] that's the way to do it that
[2:07] zoe black back then her whole face
[2:08] smiles so you can see when she's smiling
[2:11] their eyes are all smiling god bless you
[2:12] good to be in the house of the lord
[2:14] we're going to one more
[2:16] we're going to do one more part on the
[2:18] why do the healing rage
[2:20] let's turn to the book of psalms this
[2:22] will be part two and then we'll get back
[2:23] on to the
[2:25] two spirits you know i was thinking
[2:26] yesterday
[2:29] we are talking about two spirits because
[2:32] there's one influencing you or the other
[2:34] one of the two and then sometimes both
[2:35] of them are
[2:36] amen because we're still humans
[2:39] but we as being human beings though
[2:43] and and we're not and i like what
[2:45] brother branham said he said you know he
[2:47] said god is a segregationalist
[2:50] we don't segregate by color or any but
[2:52] we segregate by family by christianity
[2:56] by by as the song said sons and the
[2:59] daughters of god not everybody is the
[3:01] son and daughter of god
[3:03] not by not by genetic birth by the new
[3:06] birth
[3:08] everybody son and daughter of god by
[3:09] birth
[3:10] but not by the new birth that puts you
[3:13] in another category and god puts you in
[3:15] that category
[3:16] so under that we see that the world is
[3:20] going to rage but this part
[3:23] too will look coming over into
[3:26] death but we look over here and we see
[3:28] that that still there is that second
[3:30] power that's working today in here
[3:33] to try to get you to disbelieve the word
[3:35] of god
[3:36] all right and but what he's doing though
[3:38] is what i was thinking he's getting you
[3:41] to disbelieve the word of god
[3:43] by believing part of the word of god
[3:48] he
[3:49] satan has never said
[3:51] this bible is wrong
[3:54] no
[3:56] but what he done was come down like we
[3:58] were talking about nicea he came down
[4:00] into those men
[4:02] and diluted and polluted and added to
[4:06] the written word
[4:08] with no holy spirit revelation
[4:11] which was satan's revelation of the
[4:13] trinity and all the different things all
[4:14] the different false doctrines and then
[4:16] that
[4:17] man satan has now moved over into the
[4:19] message of the hour and he's teaching
[4:20] false doctrine again so
[4:23] uh we're still dealing with him but i
[4:25] still want to cover this again i uh
[4:28] brother uh what brother call you read
[4:30] we're gonna read another one in psalms
[4:31] three
[4:32] uh but the book of psalms is is really
[4:35] important to me
[4:36] to see your life because
[4:39] david as we were talking talk about last
[4:41] sunday and what we're going to talk
[4:42] about again
[4:44] david was anointed to be king
[4:47] he knew it
[4:48] he had a revelation
[4:50] he knew he was the only one there's not
[4:52] ever been two kings of israel there's
[4:53] only been one
[4:55] all right so he knew he was going to be
[4:56] king
[4:57] and then he comes up and he and he has
[5:00] all these troubles and trials and
[5:02] and you know he's a great conqueror he
[5:04] kills de la goliath but he has problems
[5:07] with saul and we'll get into that in a
[5:08] minute one minute battles but he was
[5:10] drove out of his kingdom as a rejected
[5:12] king
[5:13] and uh this is where we look and see
[5:15] that
[5:16] that you and i
[5:18] today if you get nothing else get this
[5:21] you and i are anointed to be king
[5:24] and princes
[5:25] of this earth
[5:28] revelation 5 tells us the whole bible
[5:31] tells us that we're coming back to an
[5:32] eating condition and we're to rule and
[5:34] reign on this earth all
[5:36] right but this is temporary then you're
[5:39] going to let we're going to let the
[5:40] heathen rage we're going to let the
[5:41] heathen do what they want to do
[5:44] but when we come back back to the bottom
[5:46] line this is our earth
[5:49] this is ours we came from this earth
[5:52] we came from the spoken word of god back
[5:54] in genesis 1 and as adam ruled and
[5:58] reigned the earth with eve
[6:00] the bride of jesus christ
[6:02] with jesus christ is going to rule and
[6:04] reign for an eternity so god bless you
[6:06] let's bow our heads just for a moment
[6:08] remember all the ones that are sick
[6:10] many different ones there's other
[6:12] churches now that are that are dealing
[6:13] with the virus so um
[6:16] we pray that they will
[6:18] they will overcome the heavenly father
[6:20] we thank you for the day that you give
[6:21] us the hour that we're living in
[6:23] and for a good church to go to and the
[6:25] good family lord church family to be a
[6:27] part of
[6:28] we pray lord now that you would sanctify
[6:30] us for this journey be with us lord in
[6:32] the futh
[6:34] anoint to hear his lord but anoint the
[6:35] speaker father so that you can do the
[6:37] speaking to the people
[6:39] and lord they'll get something from you
[6:40] today and it'll not just be a meeting of
[6:42] minds and different things but lord we
[6:44] will hear straight from you
[6:46] father we pray that you just heal the
[6:48] sick be with the ones that are not here
[6:50] lord anoint the ones for our journey
[6:52] that we're in
[6:53] be with the little bride around the
[6:55] world the different ones in the foreign
[6:56] fields we've all kind of all been cut
[6:58] off where we can't see each other much
[7:00] but we can talk
[7:01] and lord we know there's one thing for
[7:03] sure we miss each other lord
[7:05] we miss even the fellowship here lord as
[7:07] being downstairs and being distancing in
[7:10] the in the pews today lord we know we've
[7:13] we're scattered in the way that the
[7:15] world sees it but lord we should be
[7:17] united more under you father
[7:19] united under the word of god what the
[7:21] word says not what man says so lord just
[7:24] be with us today in the furthem of this
[7:26] service in jesus name we pray
[7:28] amen
[7:29] psalms 2 verse 1 says why
[7:32] do the heathen rage and the people
[7:34] imagine
[7:36] a vain thing
[7:38] because what is all this world
[7:40] it's all vanity
[7:42] nothing you can depend on wealth
[7:44] economy economics
[7:47] presidents
[7:48] politics
[7:50] the only one thing you depend on that's
[7:52] the word of god
[7:53] amen and that's what david did because
[7:55] his absolute came back to i'm going to
[7:58] be a king
[7:59] so whatever happens
[8:01] but he was still human
[8:03] and i was reading the other night where
[8:05] he would lay across his bed and he says
[8:07] my bed is wet with my tears
[8:10] crying out to god
[8:13] for his people and for deliverance and
[8:15] for the things that he needed as a human
[8:16] and that's the same way with we are now
[8:19] doing the same thing the kings of the
[8:21] earth set themselves and the rulers take
[8:22] counsel together against the lord and
[8:25] against his anointed saying
[8:27] let us break their bands asunder and
[8:29] cast away their cords from us
[8:31] but i like this part he that sitteth in
[8:33] the heavens shall laugh
[8:36] the lord shall have them
[8:39] in derision there's your promise you may
[8:41] be seated in the lord as blessing
[8:43] to the reading of the word let's read
[8:45] psalms 18 1 as we
[8:48] enter into this for
[8:50] for david's life and
[8:52] we can put many other people's lives in
[8:54] here and we can we see that
[8:58] jesus comes up to the pharisees and and
[9:00] when he was here
[9:02] he comes up to the religious leaders of
[9:04] the day and he said
[9:05] well what's the difference in you
[9:07] persecuting me and persecuting my people
[9:09] you persecuted my prophets back in the
[9:11] old testament
[9:12] because jesus christ christ was in those
[9:15] prophets
[9:17] so jesus knew what he that what the
[9:19] religious people of the world had done
[9:21] to them
[9:23] back in the old testament
[9:25] or back in the prophetic time of isaiah
[9:27] look at isaiah isaiah was a wonderful
[9:29] prophet he was a young man
[9:31] but they cut him asunder they cut him in
[9:33] pieces because he was a prophet many
[9:35] different people
[9:37] during the time and and jesus was not
[9:40] wondering he said well don't worry
[9:42] if they hate you
[9:44] they hated me in those prophets and now
[9:46] they've hated me more because i'm
[9:49] standing here i was reading yesterday in
[9:50] luke
[9:51] where they hated him because he called
[9:53] himself the son of god
[9:57] because
[9:58] because the religious world knew
[10:00] that he was saying
[10:02] i'm not a second person
[10:05] i'm god almighty in human flesh
[10:08] and that's what they hated him for and
[10:11] that's what they're going to hate you
[10:12] for
[10:13] amen
[10:15] so when we look at this and we see why
[10:18] do the heathen rage
[10:20] i hope you got something last week that
[10:22] that that we're talking about yeah i'm
[10:24] talking about the guy that
[10:26] that you know
[10:27] as an example you walk through walmart
[10:28] or you come outside of walmart and you
[10:30] you know you're in this big cloud of of
[10:33] marlboro smoke and
[10:34] and the guy's just puffing away you know
[10:36] and he's feeling fine and he's going to
[10:38] go get his beer and he's going to go
[10:40] home and he's feeling fine but yet some
[10:42] of the bride of jesus christ are
[10:45] struggling
[10:46] with disease and struggling with this
[10:48] virus and struggling with the different
[10:50] things and sometimes it makes you wonder
[10:52] kind of like david because that was the
[10:54] question why do in other words lord why
[10:57] are these people so successful
[10:59] right
[11:01] why does it seem like the guy that
[11:03] smokes a cigarette you know
[11:05] has copd and i'm just making it all
[11:07] worse he's got you know he's he's 200
[11:10] pounds overweight yet he never gets to
[11:12] virus
[11:14] you wonder that i mean you but but as
[11:16] christians you have to know one thing's
[11:18] for sure
[11:19] the footsteps of the righteous the order
[11:21] of the lord and i'll read you a quote in
[11:22] just a few minutes where brother brown
[11:24] says these light effect afflictions that
[11:26] are put on us
[11:28] are for our good amen
[11:31] if you believe but now see you can get
[11:33] on the other side and be the old woe was
[11:35] me while he was you were why is god
[11:37] doing this to me
[11:40] right
[11:41] because that's kind of what david was
[11:43] lord why do the heathen rage in other
[11:44] words why are they overtaking my kingdom
[11:47] why is my own son taking over my kingdom
[11:50] why is he why am i having to go set up
[11:53] on the top of a mountain somewhere and
[11:56] and look down on jerusalem
[11:58] and there's my kingdom
[12:00] and that the way me and you look
[12:03] you know brother brown and walked
[12:04] through the woods one day and found a
[12:05] cigarette pack and they picked it up and
[12:08] and the power of god gave him a sermon
[12:10] from it but i'm sure what brother
[12:12] branham was doing just like we do and i
[12:14] can't stand for anybody to throw
[12:16] anything out of a window and there's
[12:18] trash all over this is just me human i'm
[12:20] just talking right now all right it just
[12:22] throw something out the window and you
[12:23] see all this stuff on the side of the
[12:25] road
[12:26] right
[12:27] you know why because it's my property
[12:31] and thank god he's going to burn it off
[12:35] where that'll all burn
[12:37] and it will be ashes the prophet of god
[12:39] said
[12:41] in malachi 4 under the souls of our feet
[12:44] when we walk out into the millennium
[12:49] there won't be a cheeseburger wrapper
[12:51] and lottery tickets we're gonna have to
[12:52] step over
[12:55] i'm telling you i used to cut grass
[12:57] there at the city and
[12:58] a couple years ago and
[13:00] used to it was you know cigarette packs
[13:02] and beer cans now it's um
[13:05] now it's uh what's that's that red bull
[13:07] and lottery tickets
[13:09] or whatever monster
[13:11] it's all them energy drinks that people
[13:13] got enough energy to throw it out the
[13:14] window
[13:18] and the lottery ticket you know that
[13:20] people now are going back and picking
[13:21] them up again
[13:22] trying to look and see if somebody
[13:24] missed something you see how the world's
[13:25] gone insane you know
[13:26] and it's just that way but but we've
[13:28] polluted the world like brother brown
[13:30] said we have whatever advancement we've
[13:32] ever made cars planes trains whatever it
[13:35] is we've always
[13:38] went toward the messing up part
[13:41] but
[13:42] you and i
[13:44] must look at this
[13:47] this is my property
[13:51] and while i'm here i'm going to do the
[13:52] best i can this is i'm just giving you a
[13:54] little admonition try to make something
[13:56] better than when you left you know i you
[13:58] know me or i've told you before if i go
[14:00] through walmart and i see something
[14:02] laying on the floor i don't just kick it
[14:03] under the thing i'll pick it up and set
[14:04] it up on the shelf that's just me
[14:08] i go through the post office and
[14:09] somebody throw the letter down or they
[14:11] something i pick it up because i want to
[14:12] make something better that's just
[14:15] humanity but why not in the gospel
[14:17] should we be the same way
[14:19] that we should be crying out as we were
[14:21] reading in
[14:22] in romans
[14:23] where the whole world is waiting on the
[14:25] manifestation of the sons of god well
[14:27] listen the world's got to get bad
[14:31] before we can start manifesting
[14:33] ourselves the world's got to get bad
[14:37] why would you need to be have a
[14:39] manifestation of the sons of god when
[14:40] you got gas in your tank you got a 50
[14:42] 000 automobile
[14:46] you got a good job making a lot of money
[14:48] and why do you need manifestation of the
[14:49] sons of god
[14:51] that's just natural living like they're
[14:52] doing out there yes
[14:55] but when you need god is when somebody
[14:57] like david says lord
[14:59] why is this happening to me
[15:03] but anytime that does happen to david
[15:06] watch this right here
[15:08] psalms 18 1. now look at the caption
[15:11] there it says to the chief musician the
[15:12] psalm of david the servant of the lord
[15:14] look who spake unto the lord the words
[15:16] of this song in the day that the lord
[15:18] delivered him
[15:20] from the hand of all his enemy he said
[15:21] it was a time
[15:23] that david
[15:24] had took over all of his enemies
[15:27] there was a time when
[15:29] he was delivered from the hand of saul
[15:31] he said i will love thee o lord my
[15:33] strength
[15:34] the lord is my rock and my fortress and
[15:36] my deliverer my god my strength in whom
[15:39] i will trust my buckler in the horn of
[15:41] my salvation and my high tower
[15:44] i will call upon the lord who is worthy
[15:46] to be praised so shall i be saved from
[15:50] mine enemies
[15:52] listen do not worry
[15:55] do not fear
[15:59] the sorrows of death compassed me and
[16:00] the floods of ungodly men
[16:03] made me afraid
[16:06] whatever's happening out there that's
[16:08] ungodly
[16:10] whatever's happening up there out there
[16:11] in the world that's an ungodly world out
[16:14] there even though
[16:16] they may say they're christians and they
[16:18] may say that they believe in god but the
[16:20] devil does the same thing all right so
[16:23] be careful when you say this person
[16:27] he knows of god
[16:29] but we know god amen
[16:31] there's a lot of people knows of jesus
[16:33] christ but there's not many people that
[16:35] have an intimate relationship with him
[16:37] like we do
[16:38] amen and that he has one back to us this
[16:41] is not just a one-way street
[16:43] amen because that's what david said lord
[16:46] here i am but so i shall be saved from
[16:48] mine enemies
[16:50] though i become passed about
[16:53] he said one time the sorrows of hell
[16:55] compass me about verse five the snares
[16:57] of death prevented me
[16:59] in my distress i called upon the lord
[17:02] isn't it really easy
[17:04] to get complacent and have all those
[17:07] things in life yeah and you just say
[17:09] them little short prayers
[17:13] i'm going to talk to you today and
[17:15] you're saying them little short prayers
[17:18] lord bless us all you know that's good
[17:20] i've got everything going in the right
[17:21] direction just bless me see you bye
[17:25] but when you cry out to the lord when
[17:28] you have adversity when you have a lot
[17:30] of things going on in your life
[17:33] it makes for them long prayers
[17:36] it makes for them prayers that are what
[17:38] that have a little more i say more
[17:41] meaning to them than they did before
[17:44] because david he right there at the
[17:46] first he was anointed to be king you
[17:47] know what he'd done he went right back
[17:48] out and started herding sheep right
[17:50] yeah but there was a seed planted i
[17:53] talked about that seed the other day
[17:55] it's not a seed of anything but a seed
[17:57] of the word of god he got a word from
[17:59] samuel now remember he didn't have a
[18:02] bible to read per se
[18:05] he had the torah he knew what moses said
[18:08] but here david i don't think he walked
[18:10] out there and said
[18:11] all right i'm going to be this great
[18:12] king and i'm going to write this book of
[18:14] psalms and i'm going to have a son named
[18:15] son god don't tell you everything when
[18:17] you start your journey
[18:19] you know what he does he wants to see if
[18:21] you believe what he's already said
[18:24] there's the whole thing he wants to make
[18:26] sure you believe and it's ingrained in
[18:29] your heart
[18:30] not this heart in your in your in your
[18:33] inner being he wants to make sure
[18:36] that you understood what he said the
[18:37] first time
[18:39] all right
[18:40] then that's what he did with david david
[18:42] understood not that his brothers not
[18:45] even that saul now remember saul was
[18:47] chosen by israel to be king
[18:50] amen
[18:52] but god chose what man chose saul
[18:56] right
[18:57] god chose david
[18:59] don't know who you're going to take
[19:02] whose side are you going to take on that
[19:03] one amen
[19:06] god chose david drew samuel an anointed
[19:10] prophet for that day
[19:13] so why can't you be the same thing
[19:15] why can't you be the anointed kings and
[19:18] priest
[19:20] that believes what god said to you
[19:22] through a prophet that gave you an
[19:25] anointing
[19:27] to leave this world with
[19:30] to do something nobody's ever done
[19:31] before and it's take a body change
[19:34] but we've got to get past the white of
[19:35] the heathen rays we got to get past the
[19:37] wilds he will say why is this happening
[19:39] to me
[19:40] why is god doing this to me well i'll
[19:42] read you a few things here in just a
[19:43] little while because david
[19:45] even in verse six look in my distress
[19:49] i called upon the lord and cried unto my
[19:51] god he heard my voice
[19:53] out of his temple and my cry came before
[19:56] him even
[19:57] into my ears
[19:59] then the earth shook and trembled
[20:02] the foundations also of the hills moved
[20:04] and were shaken because he was roth
[20:07] there went up a smoke out of his
[20:09] nostrils and fire out of his mouth
[20:11] devoured
[20:12] coals were kindled by it
[20:14] he bowed the heavens also and came down
[20:17] in darkness was under under his feet
[20:20] just because
[20:23] david a child of god cried out to god
[20:26] he moved heaven and earth
[20:28] to come down there and talk to him
[20:30] now you got to believe the sign thing
[20:32] that god moved heaven and earth
[20:35] to talk to you
[20:36] amen
[20:38] psalms 37 verse 23
[20:41] says the steps of a good man are ordered
[20:43] of the lord
[20:44] and he delighteth in his way
[20:47] though he fall
[20:51] that just alleviates all the fall
[20:54] every time you fall get back up
[20:56] though
[20:58] he fall
[20:59] he shall not be utterly cast down for
[21:01] the lord upholdeth
[21:03] him
[21:04] with his hand
[21:06] i have been young and now am old yet
[21:10] have i not seen the righteous forsaken
[21:12] nor seed
[21:14] begging
[21:15] for bread we've been through some narrow
[21:17] places before we know all of us have
[21:21] but god's never been
[21:23] so far away that you can't contact him
[21:27] he is right there even david when david
[21:30] said lord why does the heathen rage who
[21:32] was he talking to
[21:37] who was he talking to
[21:39] god because god was in the room with him
[21:42] who do you think he's thought he's not
[21:43] talking to the heathen
[21:45] he's not talking to the devil he's
[21:46] asking god a question and where was god
[21:47] he was standing right there
[21:50] same way with you and i it's okay to
[21:52] question the things that go on it's okay
[21:53] to question certain things that are
[21:55] happening in your life but remember who
[21:58] are you talking to when you question
[21:59] them
[22:00] you're talking to the almighty
[22:03] you're talking to your daddy
[22:05] he's standing right there listening to
[22:07] what you got to say
[22:09] even though we may be in the wild he
[22:11] wows he woo
[22:13] he's still going to go hey
[22:15] i'm right here
[22:17] i mean who do you talk to when you pray
[22:20] who do you talk to when you pray are you
[22:22] just praying out in the air
[22:25] is it just something that a ritual that
[22:27] you do that you say well i'm gonna just
[22:29] say something maybe
[22:31] maybe somebody will hear what i said no
[22:35] right there david he's telling us the
[22:37] one before that he said i cried out to
[22:39] the lord and he heard my prayer
[22:43] you say oh god hadn't heard my prayer in
[22:44] years
[22:46] oh please
[22:48] oh please
[22:50] you're alive you're sitting here
[22:53] you're listening to the word of god
[22:56] you're doing something that most people
[23:00] would give
[23:01] uh
[23:03] brother bob and i were talking
[23:05] the other day
[23:07] you know this is something that we have
[23:10] that you know bill gates and all the
[23:12] real rich men of the world
[23:15] you think boy they're great they're
[23:16] powerful and they are they got billions
[23:18] of dollars
[23:21] but would you trade
[23:23] places
[23:24] with him
[23:27] oh but i could take this bit see that's
[23:29] the devil
[23:32] i could take this billions of dollars
[23:33] and i could build churches and i could
[23:34] take the message all around the world no
[23:36] your money would catch up with you
[23:41] whatever bill gates has got and i'm just
[23:43] saying here
[23:44] all any rich people in the world
[23:47] they have zero to what you have
[23:51] because they're going they know
[23:53] they know they're coming to an end of
[23:55] life
[23:57] and they don't have a clue if they're
[23:58] not born again they don't have a clue
[24:00] what's going to happen
[24:01] and he can't take that money with him
[24:05] but what you've got
[24:09] he can have
[24:12] if he wants it
[24:15] but he you got something that he can't
[24:17] touch
[24:25] and i know i'm just trying to get
[24:27] everybody's head here that's kind of
[24:28] hard
[24:29] strange there's a lot of room for some
[24:31] of us to get in their head
[24:36] but we look and we see though we give
[24:38] honor and we know we give honor to the
[24:40] you know we honor the president of the
[24:41] united states we honor all these
[24:42] different men
[24:44] all right because of the position that
[24:46] they hold even when you're working in a
[24:48] job the bible tells you if you're a
[24:50] servant that you do what your master
[24:52] tells you to do even the bible tells us
[24:55] that we're supposed to be that right
[24:57] right okay so that's just human that's
[25:00] just us being that makes us different
[25:02] from everybody else
[25:04] you know somebody said the other day
[25:05] said now the way people are working
[25:07] that to get employee of the month you
[25:09] just have to show up for two days in a
[25:11] row
[25:13] in a row
[25:15] two days not two months or two weeks two
[25:17] days
[25:18] so that's how the job markets got i want
[25:20] you to be a better person than anybody
[25:22] that ever has worked for whoever or
[25:24] whatever you understand what i'm saying
[25:25] because look that's the riches that i'm
[25:27] talking about
[25:29] that was the riches that god saw david
[25:32] was had an honest and a contrite heart
[25:36] david was trying his best without the
[25:39] baptism of the holy ghost in his soul
[25:44] he had an anointing
[25:46] he was anointed with the same thing that
[25:48] you're living with every day
[25:52] inside of you
[25:56] and david still
[25:58] he questions god
[26:01] but that's okay god didn't look at that
[26:03] god looked at why he was doing what he
[26:05] did david wanted to be right
[26:08] that's right do you want to be right i
[26:11] want to be
[26:12] a right person
[26:14] just even in my humanity i want to be
[26:16] and we fail every day but we surely for
[26:19] sure we want to be what god wants us to
[26:22] be
[26:23] not what man but what god wants us to be
[26:25] let's look at psalms 27 verse 1.
[26:28] excuse me
[26:30] we're going to read some scripture today
[26:31] just like we did last week that's all
[26:33] right with you
[26:34] i like reading scripture yes psalms 27
[26:37] verse 1 a psalm of david the lord is my
[26:39] light and my salvation whom shall i fear
[26:43] the lord is the strength of my life of
[26:45] whom shall i be afraid now now here's
[26:48] david in psalms 27 and i know they're
[26:50] not written all in chronological order
[26:51] but in psalms 2 he says lord why does
[26:54] that heathen rage
[26:58] but now this is something you and i stay
[27:00] awake would you please
[27:03] good grief
[27:05] stay awake
[27:07] this is worth more than any back of your
[27:08] eyelids we ever show you
[27:11] okay
[27:14] of whom shall i be afraid now david has
[27:16] worked through
[27:18] something
[27:20] same way with you and i in our journey
[27:22] we work sometimes we we get down in the
[27:25] pits and we say why does the heathen
[27:26] rage and why is everything happening to
[27:28] me well do what but we've got to come to
[27:30] a day
[27:31] of psalms 27 whom shall i fear amen
[27:36] the lord is the strength of my life
[27:38] of whom shall i be afraid
[27:41] when the wicked even my enemies and my
[27:43] foes came upon me to eat up my flesh
[27:47] they stumbled
[27:49] and fell
[27:50] wow what about that
[27:52] though in holy and camp against me
[27:54] my heart shall not fear now that doesn't
[27:56] mean you're not going to have a little
[27:58] maybe they call butterflies
[28:00] human butterflies you understand
[28:02] everybody's had them before because of
[28:04] of the uncertain because of the unseen
[28:07] but you must do like david said he put
[28:09] his heart
[28:11] the inward part of him he put at rest
[28:15] the war should rise against me
[28:19] what about somebody like david
[28:21] he was a man of war
[28:23] he physically went out and fought people
[28:25] and could have died i was thinking this
[28:27] morning
[28:28] i i couldn't have been a general in the
[28:30] confederate army or any army
[28:33] because you know there's there's a
[28:35] certain amount of death you're you're
[28:36] you're sending people out to battle
[28:39] and you know some of them's not coming
[28:41] back
[28:43] right so it's a certain there's a
[28:45] certain fear there even with you as
[28:47] being
[28:48] talking about david here there's a
[28:50] certain
[28:51] fear
[28:52] because of war is so uncertain but what
[28:54] did he do in this will i be confident
[28:58] the war should rise against me in this
[29:00] will i be confident
[29:02] one thing
[29:04] amen
[29:06] one thing that i have did one thing have
[29:09] i desired of the lord that i will seek
[29:12] after what that i may dwell in the house
[29:15] now remember last sunday we were talking
[29:16] about house that house is not a house
[29:20] it's a domain it's a dominion
[29:24] in my father's house are many mansions
[29:26] and back in the old times and even now
[29:29] still in in england and different places
[29:32] they have a a house which would be the
[29:34] house of commons they have a house of of
[29:36] roberts they have a house of dale they
[29:38] have it's your domain it's what you it's
[29:41] what you're over to protect so that's
[29:43] what he said i will dwell in the house
[29:45] of the lord all the days of my life
[29:48] because remember david didn't physically
[29:50] stay in the house of the lord all the
[29:52] days of his life
[29:53] he didn't go running get in the temple
[29:55] and sit down that's not what he's
[29:56] talking about what i'll dwell in the
[29:58] blessings
[30:00] i'll dwell in the blessings of the lord
[30:03] all the days of my life
[30:05] to behold the beauty of the lord and to
[30:08] inquire in his temple
[30:10] for in the time of trouble like i said
[30:12] before brother branham preached the
[30:13] rapture message and he used this right
[30:15] here for the time of trouble he shall
[30:17] hide me in what his pavilion not
[30:20] yours he'll hide me in his pavilion and
[30:24] the secret of his tabernacle what
[30:26] revelation
[30:30] see this is a secret bride
[30:32] this is a secret revelation just like
[30:34] the song was talking about the seek the
[30:36] revelation but now we know the
[30:38] revelation has been opened
[30:40] we're living under an open book now amen
[30:42] and now shall my head be lifted up above
[30:44] mine enemies around about me therefore
[30:47] will i offer in his tabernacle
[30:49] sacrifices of joy i will sing
[30:52] hard to get some of y'all to do that
[30:54] i will sing praises unto the lord
[30:58] hear o lord when i cry with my voice
[31:01] you know i go back to different places
[31:03] and you see david remember what david
[31:06] was david was a he he wrote songs
[31:10] and when saul would have a bad spirit
[31:15] saul
[31:21] saul in 2020
[31:24] would have a bad spirit
[31:27] right
[31:29] right he called david
[31:31] and that anointing walked right in there
[31:33] with david
[31:35] and he would play and what the bible say
[31:38] the evil spirits would go away from saul
[31:40] right make your day better if you sing a
[31:42] few songs
[31:47] just saying
[31:50] i want to make this thing better
[31:52] not worse
[31:54] for in the time of trouble he shall hide
[31:55] me in his pavilion verse six and now my
[31:57] head will be lifted though now shall my
[32:00] head be lifted above my enemies around
[32:01] about me therefore will i offer in his
[32:04] tabernacle sacrifice of joy
[32:06] i will sing yeah i will sing praises
[32:08] unto the lord hear o lord when i cry
[32:10] with my voice
[32:12] he doesn't mind if you cry
[32:15] that's right
[32:16] he wants you to ask yes
[32:19] he wants you to ask
[32:23] have mercy all upon
[32:25] also upon me and answer me when thou
[32:28] said it seek ye my face my heart said
[32:30] unto thee thy face lord will i seek
[32:32] hide not thy face far from me and put
[32:34] not thy servant away in anger thou hast
[32:37] been my help leave me not neither
[32:39] forsake me o god of my salvation
[32:41] when my father and my mother forsake me
[32:43] then the lord will take me up teach me
[32:45] thy way o lord that's what we're doing
[32:46] today
[32:47] teach me thy way o lord and lead me in
[32:49] the plain path because of mine enemies
[32:52] david
[32:55] david is honoring his enemies
[32:59] for driving him to god
[33:02] because of mine enemies listen your
[33:05] enemies what's satan satan is your worst
[33:07] enemy but what is he doing
[33:11] the things god lets him do
[33:16] is driving a son and daughter of god to
[33:18] god
[33:20] that's right so your enemies
[33:24] are the best friends you'll ever have
[33:30] that's tough but you look through all
[33:32] the psalms because of mine enemies lord
[33:34] i will
[33:36] because because i have enemies
[33:40] it makes my friends
[33:42] much better
[33:44] teach me thy way o lord and lead me in
[33:46] plain path because of mine enemies
[33:49] deliver me not over into the will of
[33:51] mine enemies for false witnesses or
[33:53] risen up against me
[33:55] and such as breathe out cruelty i had
[33:57] fainted unless i had believed to see the
[33:59] goodness of the lord you see there
[34:02] i had fainted unless i had believed to
[34:04] see the goodness of the lord into what
[34:07] land of the living in other words what
[34:08] he's doing all of his day
[34:10] wait on the lord that's our problem wait
[34:13] on the lord
[34:14] be of good courage and he shall
[34:16] strengthen thine heart wait i say
[34:19] on the lord all right let's go to isaiah
[34:22] 59 18.
[34:24] according to their deeds according he
[34:26] will repay fury
[34:29] to his adversaries recompense to his
[34:32] enemies to the islands he will repay
[34:34] recompense so shall they fear the name
[34:36] of the lord now where is the name of the
[34:38] lord
[34:41] it's in you and me
[34:45] that's what the world is missing
[34:48] the world is missing
[34:50] the name
[34:51] being associated with the name now oh
[34:54] lord they use that name many times but
[34:56] it's not a good way but you and i are
[34:58] totally eternally connected
[35:01] to that name
[35:04] so shall they fear the name of the lord
[35:05] from the west and his glory from the
[35:07] rising of the sun when the enemy shall
[35:09] come in like a flood we know they're
[35:10] going to
[35:12] the spirit of the lord shall lift up a
[35:13] standard against him
[35:15] and the redeemer shall come to where
[35:17] zion
[35:19] and to them that turn from transgression
[35:21] in jacob
[35:22] saith the lord as for me this is my
[35:24] covenant with them saith the lord my
[35:27] spirit that is upon thee
[35:29] and my words which i have put in thy
[35:31] mouth shall not depart of thy mouth nor
[35:34] out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of
[35:36] the mouth of thy seed seed saith the
[35:38] lord from henceforth and forever
[35:41] in other words it will never diminish
[35:45] even though we have been through
[35:47] denominations and we've been out in the
[35:49] world come through denominations and all
[35:50] the different places you just kept going
[35:53] right yeah and then god brings you right
[35:55] here
[35:57] to the message of the hour amen
[35:59] so it will not depart
[36:01] i like what brother brown said he said
[36:03] you know some old grandma
[36:05] great grandma got on her knees one day
[36:09] and said lord i want you to bless not
[36:11] only my seed
[36:13] i want you to bless my seed seed because
[36:15] you promised
[36:17] that you would continue on and then here
[36:20] you come
[36:21] right out of all that right out of all
[36:23] that chaos
[36:24] let's go to micah 7 7. therefore
[36:26] while i look unto the lord i will wait
[36:28] for the god of my salvation my god will
[36:31] hear me
[36:32] rejoice not against me o my enemies
[36:35] when i fall
[36:36] i shall arise
[36:38] and when i sit in darkness
[36:40] the lord shall be a light unto me
[36:44] now do we really believe that
[36:46] amen because we go
[36:48] we go
[36:49] no lord it's so dark in here i know
[36:51] you're not here
[36:53] it's so dark in here i can't see
[36:54] anything
[36:56] i think when i sit in darkness the lord
[36:58] shall be a light yes
[37:01] unto me i will bear the indignation of
[37:03] the lord because i have sinned against
[37:05] him
[37:06] until he plead my cause and execute
[37:09] judgment for me
[37:10] he will bring me forth to the light and
[37:13] i shall behold his righteousness how
[37:15] many of you have went through a journey
[37:16] and went through a battle and and said
[37:18] why does the heathen rage yet when you
[37:20] get to the other end of it as brother
[37:21] bob was talking about the other night
[37:23] you get to the end of
[37:25] of
[37:27] the enemy
[37:29] of what you're dealing with right then
[37:30] or a problem
[37:32] what do you do you look back and you go
[37:34] man thank you lord
[37:36] thank you lord because i was heading in
[37:38] the wrong direction or i would i had
[37:40] this wrong thought or this way i wanted
[37:42] to go this way and lord you put a little
[37:44] adversity in my way to train to change
[37:47] the course and lord that course was
[37:49] exactly what you wanted me to do
[37:53] that's why the footsteps of the
[37:54] righteous are ordered of the lord
[37:57] ordered he has ordered a legion of
[38:00] angels
[38:10] we can't lose folks
[38:13] we cannot lose
[38:16] then she that is my enemy shall see it
[38:19] and shame shall cover her
[38:22] which said unto me
[38:24] where is the lord
[38:26] thy god my eyes shall behold her now
[38:29] shall she be trodden down as the mire of
[38:30] the streets i remember remember brother
[38:32] uh gershon solomon was telling us
[38:34] um that when he was in the six day war
[38:38] that remember he was out there in the
[38:39] desert and he got um i think a tank ran
[38:43] over him or he was down low and the tank
[38:45] had run over the top of it and didn't
[38:46] run over him but he was out there and
[38:48] then here comes the whoever it is
[38:49] palestinians and they're
[38:51] running out there remember him telling
[38:52] the story if you haven't heard it you
[38:54] need to listen to it it's on youtube i
[38:55] think but he's he's he's a soldier and
[38:58] he's surrounded by these palestinians
[39:00] and he doesn't know if he's going to get
[39:02] captured or if they're just going to
[39:03] pow-pow and take care of him and he said
[39:06] all of a sudden they kind of look up
[39:08] and he said they drop their weapons and
[39:10] turn and run
[39:15] and the end of the story was that either
[39:17] he interviewed somebody that was in that
[39:19] platoon or he inter they something got
[39:21] the the
[39:23] um story got told that
[39:27] there was
[39:28] angels or people
[39:30] just rose up behind gershon solomon well
[39:33] now i'm telling you buddy the footsteps
[39:34] of the righteous
[39:36] you don't know that because you didn't
[39:38] see it now he didn't see it he was
[39:40] looking this way looking down a gun
[39:41] barrel
[39:43] i don't think he was
[39:45] thinking about a host of angels standing
[39:47] here but he said to look on those
[39:48] people's face and they said oh they were
[39:50] everywhere
[39:53] how many times that ever happened in
[39:54] your life where you look at something
[39:56] and you go
[39:58] how did that change
[40:01] well you weren't in another dimension
[40:02] where god was and he had those legions
[40:04] of angels watching after you
[40:07] amen
[40:09] because the footsteps of the righteous
[40:11] you know what that was a testimony
[40:14] if gershon's life would have ended right
[40:16] there that wouldn't have been a
[40:17] testimony
[40:18] but god wasn't finished with him he's
[40:20] still over there doing his work now in
[40:22] israel doing the things he needs to do
[40:24] because of what because of a little
[40:26] thing that he went through now that's
[40:27] not something you and i never been
[40:29] through that before
[40:30] i mean being a soldier in war knowing
[40:33] that you could die at any minute and
[40:36] that the host of your enemy was around
[40:38] you and their guns were pointed in your
[40:40] face
[40:43] oh we never been through that before
[40:46] but we've been through those little
[40:47] trials that you see that things have
[40:49] been changed and we don't know that well
[40:51] you don't know what's going on back here
[40:53] you don't know what's going on in
[40:54] another dimension
[40:56] let's listen to brother branham we read
[40:58] this last sunday we'll read it again
[41:00] number one smyrna church age
[41:03] unless we suffer with him we cannot
[41:05] reign with him
[41:06] you have to suffer
[41:08] to reign
[41:09] now i want you to keep that in your mind
[41:11] that listen god is not some mad person
[41:14] who is mad at you and
[41:16] he's he's got it out for you
[41:19] no but he knows you're a human being
[41:23] and being a human being we lean toward
[41:26] the carnal mind first
[41:32] and he knows that
[41:35] but he's that spiritual rudder inside of
[41:37] you needs a little every once in a while
[41:40] amen
[41:41] you want the wind to blow in another
[41:43] direction every once in a while so you
[41:44] have to suffer
[41:46] to reign the reason for this is that
[41:48] character simply is never made without
[41:51] suffering
[41:53] think of the character building you've
[41:54] had in your life so far
[41:56] character is a victory
[41:58] not a gift so god's not going to gift
[42:01] you character
[42:03] he's going to gift you love joy peace
[42:05] longsuffering and all those different
[42:06] things because that's what the bible
[42:07] says but the bible says you're not going
[42:09] to get character
[42:12] it's not a gift
[42:14] character characters of victory now look
[42:17] look characters of victory
[42:23] doesn't say anything about a battle
[42:26] you didn't lose
[42:29] if you are victorious you won
[42:34] you got to look at these things what's
[42:35] what this what god's saying to us
[42:39] character is a victory not a gift
[42:41] a man without character can't reign
[42:46] think about god almighty that can just
[42:48] destroy this world by snapping his
[42:49] finger
[42:51] he can't do it because he's got
[42:52] character
[42:55] he can't do it because of what he said
[42:57] amen you say god can do anything nope
[43:00] brother said god can't do anything he
[43:02] can't do what his word didn't say
[43:04] he's got to do what his word said
[43:07] all right
[43:08] he can't change his word to so he can't
[43:10] change his mind
[43:11] he can't change what's going on a man
[43:13] without character can't reign because
[43:15] power
[43:16] apart from character
[43:18] is satanic see thou what did god do he
[43:21] gave
[43:22] permitted power
[43:24] to lucifer
[43:28] told him you're the anointed cherub
[43:30] you're the one the cherub that covers
[43:32] you walk up and down the earth you do
[43:33] this you're my anointed you're my
[43:35] remember we talk you're my right hand
[43:37] guy
[43:39] he was given power though
[43:41] he didn't have the power he was given
[43:44] power
[43:45] [Music]
[43:47] and he has no character
[43:50] satan has no guard-like character
[43:54] so that's why a man without character
[43:56] can't reign because power apart from
[43:58] character
[43:59] is satanic
[44:01] but power with character is fit to rule
[44:04] and since he wants us to share
[44:06] even his throne on the same basis that
[44:09] he overcome
[44:11] and sat down in his father's throne now
[44:13] remember this is the overcomer in this
[44:15] age
[44:16] revelations 3 so this is our what we get
[44:19] our overcoming
[44:21] excuse me is to sit with him
[44:24] sit down in his father's throne then we
[44:26] have to overcome to sit with him and the
[44:28] little temporary sufferings we go
[44:30] through now is not worthy to be compared
[44:32] to the tremendous glory that will be
[44:35] what revealed in us
[44:38] when he comes how is he going to reveal
[44:40] himself through your life
[44:43] no other way except through your life
[44:46] he can't do it through words man has to
[44:48] take words and they've she's turned
[44:50] they've the world's turned it in all
[44:51] different ways
[44:54] so it's me and you in flesh it's the god
[44:56] in flesh that's going to destroy the
[44:58] effects of the devil oh what treasures
[45:01] are laid up for those who are willing to
[45:02] enter into his kingdom through
[45:04] a little bit of tribulation
[45:07] oh that says much
[45:10] much tribulation think you're not
[45:12] strained concerning the fiery trials
[45:13] that are to try you that is what peter
[45:15] said is it strange that god wants us to
[45:17] develop a christ-like character that
[45:19] comes through suffering no sir
[45:21] and we all have trials we are all tried
[45:24] and chastened as sons
[45:25] not one
[45:27] but goes through that
[45:29] nobody is immune
[45:32] nobody is immune
[45:34] the church that is not suffering and is
[45:36] not being tried
[45:39] hasn't got it
[45:42] it isn't of god
[45:44] hebrews 12 6 is for whom the lord loveth
[45:46] he chasteneth us and scourges every son
[45:48] whom he receiveth
[45:49] but if ye be without chastisement
[45:52] whereof all are partakers then are ye
[45:55] bastards and not sons
[45:56] now this special condition in smyrna
[45:58] must be applied to every age there is no
[46:01] age free from it
[46:04] all right
[46:05] every church age went through some sort
[46:07] of persecution some sort of trial some
[46:10] sort of trouble
[46:12] there's no true believer free from it
[46:15] this is of god
[46:16] this is the will of god and it's not the
[46:19] will of god because he's just like i
[46:21] said he's a he's a sadist and he wants
[46:23] to just put everything he can on you no
[46:25] he knows what you need
[46:28] he knows the way we lean
[46:31] sorry but we do we lean toward the
[46:34] carnal mind first
[46:36] sorry we're just humans we were born
[46:38] that way
[46:41] but we've got to break out of that and
[46:43] then trust what god said
[46:45] which is not the carnal mind because the
[46:46] carnal mind is enmity with that or
[46:48] division it's it's it's against it
[46:51] this is the will of god it is needful
[46:55] we need the lord to teach us the truth
[46:57] that we are to suffer and be christ-like
[47:00] in doing it
[47:01] love suffereth long in his kind matthew
[47:03] 5 verse 11 12 blessed are you when man
[47:05] shall revile you
[47:07] oh i hate it when somebody says
[47:09] something bad about me
[47:12] he said blessed are ye
[47:15] when men shall revile you and persecute
[47:17] you and shall say all manner of evil
[47:18] against you falsely
[47:21] now there's your key if it's true he's
[47:23] telling the truth
[47:25] but if it's falsely
[47:27] then it's on him
[47:29] rejoice and be exceeding glad for great
[47:30] is your reward in heaven for so
[47:32] persecuted they the what the prophets
[47:35] which were before you
[47:37] now here's a quote we were talking about
[47:38] last sunday the cloudy skies and storms
[47:40] of life are no signs of god disapproval
[47:42] so don't sit down one day and say all
[47:44] this is happening on me i must not be a
[47:46] child of god
[47:48] don't ever say that
[47:50] amen
[47:52] neither are bright skies and still
[47:54] waters everything's going well paychecks
[47:57] coming in the door bills are getting
[47:59] paid we got good car we got oh we can go
[48:02] to walmart and buy a hundred dollars
[48:03] worth of groceries
[48:05] just groceries
[48:07] how many of you can get out of walmart
[48:08] without spending a hundred dollars
[48:14] y'all lying
[48:18] yeah you i'm not talking about you i'm
[48:20] not about christine never raised her
[48:21] hand
[48:24] i mean really
[48:26] but you see what i'm saying about that's
[48:28] no persecution
[48:30] it's cause you can't buy by 50 worth of
[48:32] groceries
[48:33] but look
[48:34] so neither the bright skies and still
[48:36] water sign of his love and approval
[48:38] his approval of any of us is only in the
[48:41] beloved now what is the beloved this is
[48:43] word his love is elective which he had
[48:46] for us before the foundation of the
[48:47] world does he love us oh yes
[48:50] but how shall we know now how are you
[48:52] going to know that god loves you
[48:54] we shall know because he said so and
[48:56] where did he say so at he said so in the
[48:58] word
[48:59] amen
[49:00] and he manifested that he did love us
[49:03] for he brought us to himself see that's
[49:05] the love of god is to give you an
[49:06] opportunity to be part of him
[49:09] oh that's a great opportunity folks
[49:11] goodness
[49:12] and manifest that he did love us for he
[49:15] brought us to himself
[49:18] and gave us of his spirit placing us
[49:21] as sons
[49:24] not just bringing us in the foal but
[49:26] placing us
[49:28] you know in other words having some
[49:29] confidence in you
[49:32] to do what to do what the word said and
[49:35] how shall i prove my love to him by
[49:37] believing what he said
[49:40] not by
[49:43] signs
[49:45] by believing what he said and by
[49:47] conducting myself with what
[49:50] hatred i'm again oh i'm having these
[49:52] trials and
[49:53] god's so far away nope
[49:56] remember folks if you are going through
[49:58] a trial
[49:59] god is right there
[50:02] and he
[50:03] is the one orchestrating the thing
[50:05] because when you get through that trial
[50:06] he's going to cut that thing off he's
[50:08] not going to let satan just buff at you
[50:10] the whole time of your life on that one
[50:11] thing you've got something you got to
[50:13] get rid of lay it down
[50:16] lay it down and go on i'll promise you
[50:17] there's something else going to pop up
[50:20] so get rid of that one right then
[50:23] by conducting myself with joy
[50:27] amidst the trials that he in his what
[50:30] wisdom allows to come to pass
[50:34] thank you god you sent a prophet that
[50:36] could tell us exactly what you are
[50:39] thinking
[50:40] amen
[50:43] is that true yeah i mean you believe
[50:45] that
[50:46] all right let's go to romans 8 15 then
[50:49] for you have not received the spirit of
[50:50] bondage again to fear but you have
[50:51] received the spirit of adoption where
[50:53] you cry
[50:54] daddy daddy this is your entering your
[50:56] birth the spirit of self bearing witness
[50:58] with our spirit that we what are the
[50:59] children of god
[51:01] and if children then heirs heirs of god
[51:03] and joint heirs with christ if so be
[51:05] that we what suffer with him
[51:07] they might that we might be also
[51:09] glorified together for i reckon
[51:12] amen
[51:13] that the sufferings of this present time
[51:17] whatever you're going through
[51:19] are not worthy to be compared with the
[51:22] glory which shall be revealed
[51:25] in us
[51:26] for the earnest expectation of the
[51:28] creature what waiteth for the
[51:29] manifestation of the sons of god like i
[51:30] said before how are you going to become
[51:32] a manifested son of god without going
[51:34] through this
[51:35] building trial
[51:36] are these character building things then
[51:39] what to be a manifested son of god is
[51:41] when you don't have no food
[51:45] and you say god
[51:49] i need a pantry full of food
[51:53] i don't have gas in my tank
[51:56] i got to go pray for somebody i got
[51:58] something to do lord
[52:00] there's your manifestation you can and
[52:02] like i said you go and spend a hundred
[52:03] dollars every day at walmart just on
[52:05] groceries that ain't
[52:07] that's just manifesting you got a good
[52:09] job
[52:12] you see what i mean
[52:17] let's go to james five verse seven read
[52:19] some scripture here and then we'll read
[52:21] a few quotes that okay
[52:23] be patient therefore brethren okay right
[52:25] there it is
[52:27] be patient therefore brethren unto the
[52:29] coming of the lord behold the husband
[52:31] will wait us for the precious fruit of
[52:33] the earth now you know what
[52:35] god planted
[52:37] the seed
[52:38] it just didn't automatically become a
[52:40] tree and start burning fruit
[52:43] process you got to go through that's
[52:46] right
[52:47] i've waited for about 11 years
[52:50] on my apple tree
[52:52] one of them to make bigger apples
[52:55] this year
[52:57] they made big apples
[52:59] 11 years though i planted that thing 11
[53:02] years ago
[53:04] and i'm waiting i've been waiting i've
[53:05] been waiting i've been waiting and
[53:06] finally brother gabe i got some momma
[53:08] tell you we got some bigger apples but
[53:09] that big good old canning apple
[53:12] but i had to wait on it though i
[53:13] couldn't just go down there and say all
[53:14] right three years later you're nothing
[53:16] and you go in there and mow it down with
[53:17] a lawnmower
[53:19] no you had to have patience because you
[53:21] knew what you planted
[53:24] think of that god knows what he planted
[53:28] yes amen
[53:29] behold the husband waited for the
[53:31] precious fruit of the earth and has long
[53:34] patience for it
[53:35] until received the early and latter rain
[53:38] be ye also patient
[53:41] establish your hearts for the coming of
[53:42] the lord draweth nigh grudge not one
[53:44] against another brethren
[53:46] lest you be condemned behold the judge
[53:48] standeth before the door look take my
[53:50] brethren the prophets who have spoken in
[53:52] the name of the lord for an example of
[53:54] suffering affliction and of patience
[53:56] that's like i said before james is
[53:58] talking about the well you've never been
[54:00] persecuted like they've been like they
[54:01] were persecuted you've never been
[54:03] persecuted like the prophets of the old
[54:05] you've never been persecuted like jesus
[54:06] was persecuted you've never been
[54:08] persecuted like peter james and john and
[54:10] all the different ones that gave their
[54:12] life that died by stoning that died by
[54:14] beheading that died by crucifixion
[54:18] amen all right that's first peter 2 19.
[54:22] for this is stateworthy if a man for
[54:24] conscious toward god endure grief
[54:27] suffering wrongfully for what glory is
[54:29] it if when you be buffeted for your
[54:31] faults
[54:32] you shall take it patiently but if when
[54:35] you do well and suffer for it you take
[54:37] it patiently
[54:38] this is acceptable with god now who i
[54:40] mean wants to be acceptable with god
[54:42] we're right there's what it is
[54:44] for even here unto where were you called
[54:48] because christ also suffered for us
[54:51] leaving us an example that ye should
[54:53] follow his steps who did no sin neither
[54:56] was guile found in his mouth who when he
[54:58] was reviled reviled not again that's a
[55:03] problem for a lot of us
[55:05] when he suffered he threatened not
[55:08] i'll get you when i get done with this i
[55:11] know god's going to get me through this
[55:12] and when i do buddy you're in trouble
[55:14] no see that's a horrible attitude you'll
[55:17] never get through that
[55:18] see that's power
[55:20] without character
[55:23] but committed himself to him that judges
[55:27] righteously let's look at the layout of
[55:28] seeing church age
[55:31] brother brown says to him though he's
[55:33] reading revelation 3 to him that
[55:34] overcometh will i grant to sit with me
[55:36] in my throne even as i overcome and i'm
[55:38] sitting down with my father in his
[55:39] throne now what are we to overcome
[55:41] that is the normal question to ask
[55:44] because that's what we're looking for
[55:44] well we got corona we got this we got
[55:46] there we go what do we what do we look
[55:48] it's not what you overcome
[55:52] it's how you overcome it
[55:55] now that's so profound
[55:58] that god had to send us a prophet to say
[56:00] that
[56:00] that didn't come through
[56:04] confucius or buddha or that came from a
[56:06] prophet in the end time
[56:08] to tell us that and then when you read
[56:10] these things sometimes
[56:12] you know i think when brother branham
[56:13] was preaching all the theologians that's
[56:15] why he had a lot of problem with
[56:16] theologians because the theologians
[56:18] would be going
[56:20] he's just contrary to everything that
[56:22] we're we've been taught or are thinking
[56:25] but it's exactly what god wants us to
[56:27] hear
[56:28] right here because look
[56:30] what are we to overcome it is not the
[56:32] actual thought of this verse for it is
[56:34] not so much what we are to overcome
[56:38] because we do like i said we have a
[56:40] laundry list well i overcome that i
[56:42] overcome this i can't overcome this i
[56:43] got this i got it
[56:45] it's not what you overcome
[56:48] it's how you did it
[56:51] but how we are to overcome now this is
[56:54] logical
[56:55] let's see they're all sitting there
[56:57] going this is illogical
[56:59] all the theologians all the carnal mind
[57:03] but this is the mind of god do you not
[57:05] know that
[57:06] that this is the mind of god talking to
[57:08] us through a
[57:10] prophet that's why they call it the
[57:12] voice of god recordings
[57:14] that's why they call it
[57:16] the voice of god sure it was the voice
[57:18] of william branham but it was god
[57:20] speaking through that voice
[57:23] now this is logical for does it matter
[57:25] much
[57:26] what we are to overcome
[57:28] as long as we know how
[57:30] we can overcome
[57:32] a quick look of these scriptures which
[57:34] involve the lord jesus overcoming will
[57:36] bring out the truth of this proposition
[57:39] in matthew 4 wherein jesus is tempted of
[57:41] the devil he overcame the personal
[57:42] temptation of satan
[57:44] by the word and by the word only in
[57:46] other words he didn't bring some kind of
[57:47] great
[57:48] uh he didn't just say all right devil
[57:51] you can't speak
[57:52] or he could have
[57:55] he had power over the devil we know that
[57:57] but how did he defeat him he defeated
[57:59] him by the word that way me and you can
[58:01] do the same thing
[58:03] amen me and you can quote the word back
[58:05] to the devil and by the word only and
[58:08] each of the three major trials that
[58:09] correspond exactly to the temptation of
[58:11] the garden of eden the lust of the flesh
[58:13] the lust of the eyes and the pride of
[58:14] life jesus overcame by the word
[58:17] eve fell to the personal temptation of
[58:20] satan by failing
[58:22] to use the word
[58:25] adam fell in direct disobedience to the
[58:27] word he knew what it was and he walked
[58:29] out anyway
[58:30] but jesus overcame by the word
[58:33] and right now let me say that this is
[58:35] the only way to be an overcomer
[58:39] what overcome by the word
[58:41] amen
[58:43] also it is the only way that you can
[58:45] know if you are overcoming because that
[58:48] word can't fail now notice again how
[58:50] jesus overcame the world systems of
[58:52] religion
[58:53] when he was repeatedly badgered by the
[58:55] theologians of his day he constantly
[58:57] applied what the word he was always
[59:00] quoting the old testament to him
[59:02] yeah it is written it is written it is
[59:05] written right
[59:07] problem is is they're going yeah we know
[59:09] but that's not what we're interpreting
[59:11] it as
[59:12] same way the people what about today
[59:14] same spirit was there then as here now
[59:17] he spake only what the father gave him
[59:18] to speak there was not a time when the
[59:20] world was not utterly
[59:22] confused
[59:24] by his wisdom
[59:26] for it was the what wisdom
[59:28] of god
[59:30] all right let's right here
[59:33] speak to the rock 1953.
[59:36] there's no such thing as death
[59:39] to a christian
[59:41] that's why this we we come here to this
[59:44] and this is going to be close to the end
[59:45] we that's what i didn't get to last
[59:47] sunday
[59:48] we come to this part that we say oh all
[59:50] right well every we every trial we can
[59:52] handle every trial but boy there's death
[59:58] right there's no such thing as death to
[1:00:01] a christian
[1:00:03] there's not one
[1:00:05] scripture in the bible now what do you
[1:00:07] say take it back to the word
[1:00:09] there is not one scripture in the bible
[1:00:11] that tells you a christian dies
[1:00:16] who we're going to depend on
[1:00:18] the world
[1:00:19] or the word
[1:00:21] very much contrary
[1:00:24] we're all
[1:00:27] amen alive
[1:00:28] said he that believeth on me has
[1:00:30] everlasting life is that right how can
[1:00:32] it have an end if it's got everlasting
[1:00:35] see he that hears my word and believeth
[1:00:37] on me on him that sent me has
[1:00:39] everlasting life and shall not come into
[1:00:42] condemnation but look but has passed
[1:00:45] from death to life that's true so we
[1:00:48] can't die
[1:00:49] we cannot or can't cease to exist
[1:00:53] amen
[1:00:54] once you're born again of the spirit of
[1:00:55] god you can never
[1:00:57] ever cease to exist
[1:01:01] oh you can be separated in this
[1:01:02] dimension but you're just coming right
[1:01:04] back in here
[1:01:07] in a glorified condition
[1:01:10] will always be there was a time when you
[1:01:14] wasn't nothing or anything
[1:01:17] now watch
[1:01:19] here's another one that you can't get a
[1:01:20] scholar to say this
[1:01:22] but there was there never will be a time
[1:01:25] but what you'll be something in
[1:01:27] somewhere
[1:01:29] let me read that again there was a time
[1:01:31] when you wasn't nothing in other words
[1:01:32] you were in the mind of god you weren't
[1:01:34] just a thought in your parents mind
[1:01:36] didn't know you were coming didn't know
[1:01:37] your name didn't know if you were going
[1:01:38] to be male or female i understand what
[1:01:40] i'm saying
[1:01:42] because you came by natural birth
[1:01:44] but now that you're born again
[1:01:48] there will never be a time but what
[1:01:51] you'll be something and somewhere
[1:01:55] you've passed from death into life
[1:01:57] you're going to be somewhere from this
[1:02:00] all through ceaseless ages
[1:02:02] all eternity you'll be somewhere boy i
[1:02:06] like that
[1:02:08] that means you're not lost everybody
[1:02:10] else just lost means what they don't
[1:02:12] know where they're going
[1:02:13] and they surely don't know where they're
[1:02:15] going to end up
[1:02:16] right
[1:02:17] but boy we do don't we
[1:02:20] so now i just think
[1:02:23] about that sometimes when trials gets
[1:02:25] hard
[1:02:28] this is a prophet talking
[1:02:30] i hit snags
[1:02:32] in my life oh no brother branham you no
[1:02:37] i hit snags in my life like everybody
[1:02:41] some hard trials we have to pull hard
[1:02:45] to get through it
[1:02:48] you know sometimes we forget
[1:02:51] that brother brown tried to take his
[1:02:52] life a couple of times
[1:02:56] without the grace of god could have been
[1:02:57] a murderer
[1:02:59] he was going to shoot that boy he said i
[1:03:01] was going to shoot the boy
[1:03:03] he didn't say i was going to try to he
[1:03:05] said i was going to shoot the boy he was
[1:03:06] going to actually do something to that
[1:03:08] guy that poisoned his dog
[1:03:10] you see what i'm talking about
[1:03:12] he was human thank god he was human
[1:03:14] right
[1:03:16] but when i'm up against it i just think
[1:03:19] of this
[1:03:22] well
[1:03:24] what difference does it make
[1:03:28] that didn't get to you you're looking
[1:03:30] for something so profound and brother
[1:03:32] brown says
[1:03:34] when i'm up against something i just
[1:03:35] think well
[1:03:36] what difference does it make
[1:03:39] the bible said and he took it right back
[1:03:41] to the word all things work together for
[1:03:43] good to them that love him is that right
[1:03:46] so maybe it's for my good
[1:03:49] so i just go right ahead and take it
[1:03:51] anyhow
[1:03:53] oh boy we don't want that
[1:03:56] we don't want to take that
[1:03:59] this is what brother man's telling us
[1:04:01] and if i if it there's nothing can
[1:04:04] bother you
[1:04:06] even death itself
[1:04:09] can't bother you
[1:04:11] when death comes though out of the old
[1:04:13] prophet when they was building a
[1:04:14] scaffold out there to cut his head off
[1:04:17] why he said death
[1:04:19] where's thy sting
[1:04:21] grave
[1:04:22] where's my victory
[1:04:24] no sting to death no why where where
[1:04:26] where's your victory grave grave said
[1:04:29] i'll have you after a while i'll get you
[1:04:31] paul said
[1:04:33] what can you do to me
[1:04:35] that's it
[1:04:36] oh wait what are you gonna do to me
[1:04:39] well i'm already i'm already a child of
[1:04:41] god what are you going to do to me
[1:04:43] second corinthians 4 verse 15.
[1:04:50] for all things
[1:04:52] are for your sake
[1:04:54] that the abundant grace might through
[1:04:57] the thanksgiving of many
[1:04:59] redound to the glory of god in other
[1:05:00] words we've got to all go through it for
[1:05:02] which cause we faint not
[1:05:05] but though our outward man perish
[1:05:09] yet the inward man is renewed day by day
[1:05:12] that's why folks we need these
[1:05:14] persecution we need something to remind
[1:05:16] us to pray a little harder to study a
[1:05:20] little harder to not say why me lord
[1:05:26] and we don't want to be where we say
[1:05:28] pour it on me lord
[1:05:31] right because we're human
[1:05:33] but we want that balance
[1:05:35] and the only one person knows that
[1:05:36] balance me and you do not know that
[1:05:38] balance
[1:05:40] god's the only one that knows that
[1:05:41] balance and he's got his foot on that
[1:05:42] rudder
[1:05:43] and he knows what we need and he knows
[1:05:45] when to let off
[1:05:47] for our light affliction this is second
[1:05:49] corinthians for a light affliction which
[1:05:51] is but for a moment
[1:05:54] worketh for us a far more exceeding
[1:05:58] and eternal
[1:06:00] weight of glory
[1:06:03] you want the weight of the world or you
[1:06:04] want the weight of glory
[1:06:06] we got enough of the weight of the world
[1:06:08] right
[1:06:10] for our light affliction which is but
[1:06:11] for a moment worketh for us a far more
[1:06:13] exceeding and eternal weight of glory
[1:06:15] while we look not at the things which
[1:06:17] are seen
[1:06:19] but the things which are not seen for
[1:06:21] the things which are seen or what
[1:06:22] temporal
[1:06:24] but the things which are not seen
[1:06:26] are eternal let's listen to this last
[1:06:28] quote when the musicians come
[1:06:33] i just want i just wanted to put these
[1:06:34] two sermons in here because i sat down
[1:06:36] one day and i just kind of put myself in
[1:06:39] david's place
[1:06:43] i'm an anointed king now he didn't get
[1:06:45] all puffed up about that
[1:06:47] right
[1:06:48] that's right i mean
[1:06:51] you know most people go well you're
[1:06:53] going to be the
[1:06:54] why
[1:06:55] not you brother donny but most people
[1:06:57] without the right character that'll make
[1:06:59] their head get about that big
[1:07:02] and even though he was a young boy he
[1:07:03] had to grow up to be a man he had to go
[1:07:06] through that character building most
[1:07:08] people would have run and jumped up on
[1:07:09] the throne and sat there and had saul
[1:07:12] killed and everybody else killed because
[1:07:13] bless god i'm king god told me i was
[1:07:15] king and i'm the king now listen you
[1:07:17] can't rule and reign like that
[1:07:19] but you know but listen folks the inward
[1:07:21] man does yes that's right the inward man
[1:07:24] but by character you hold that power
[1:07:27] i've always said many times before we
[1:07:30] come up to this place of speaking terms
[1:07:32] with god if you don't have the right
[1:07:34] kind of character
[1:07:38] if you don't like that guy if your
[1:07:39] neighbor's been giving you trouble or
[1:07:41] your boss has been giving you trouble or
[1:07:43] that person cuts you off on the side on
[1:07:45] the road and about runs you off the road
[1:07:47] you know what what you speak
[1:07:51] is what god's going to have to honor
[1:07:55] elisha and the she-bears
[1:07:58] the different things
[1:07:59] that's why power without character
[1:08:01] satanic but when you come to the power
[1:08:04] where you can hold that power back
[1:08:09] and not and not and not
[1:08:13] not let it be rage
[1:08:16] because that's what we get
[1:08:17] we get mad
[1:08:21] but see if you're on speaking conditions
[1:08:22] all you gotta do is say something wrong
[1:08:24] and you've done something wrong to
[1:08:26] somebody
[1:08:28] jesus christ could have stopped the
[1:08:30] crucifixion any time he wanted to
[1:08:35] he even told him he said i can bring a
[1:08:37] legion of angels
[1:08:39] and just wipe this you talking about
[1:08:41] romans and you talking about your army
[1:08:46] but what did he do he said
[1:08:50] i'm done
[1:08:52] i'm here to do a job
[1:08:55] and i'm not going to revile back
[1:08:57] i'm not going to say a word
[1:09:00] i know i can stop it
[1:09:02] but i'm not going to stop it because i
[1:09:04] got some i got some kids inside of me
[1:09:08] that needs to be birthed
[1:09:10] so what about me and you what about us
[1:09:12] having long suffering even with our own
[1:09:14] natural children and all the different
[1:09:15] people but i look right here
[1:09:18] but that's why i kind of came up with
[1:09:19] this and i hope it helps you some i hope
[1:09:21] it helps you in your daily life
[1:09:23] because we live our daily life a lot
[1:09:24] more than we live here
[1:09:26] amen
[1:09:28] now here's brother brown praying now
[1:09:30] lord heal the sick as they come up to be
[1:09:32] prayed for this morning give to them
[1:09:34] that joy that they long to be well
[1:09:38] let them know that this little light
[1:09:41] affliction
[1:09:42] was put upon them
[1:09:44] is just a little testing time
[1:09:49] god knows all about it
[1:09:52] he did it to see what you'd do about it
[1:09:58] he did it to see what you do we'd do
[1:10:01] about it how god
[1:10:03] may they step right out there and claim
[1:10:07] that finished work
[1:10:09] may they not provoke you
[1:10:11] by be running here and there and in and
[1:10:13] out well i don't know this that you know
[1:10:16] i don't know i don't know no you better
[1:10:17] start knowing something
[1:10:18] lord may they take a straight stand
[1:10:22] and say lord you was the one who saved
[1:10:24] me
[1:10:25] you was the one who did these things for
[1:10:28] me i believe you and i'm trusting in you
[1:10:31] today and i pray that you'll grant this
[1:10:33] to the people in christ's name
[1:10:36] amen he prayed this prayer right before
[1:10:39] he had a prayer line
[1:10:40] he was getting the people ready
[1:10:43] look he did it to see what we'd do about
[1:10:46] it
[1:10:49] may they step right out there and claim
[1:10:51] that finished work these light
[1:10:53] afflictions is just a little
[1:10:55] testing time god knows all about it
[1:11:02] sometimes we think we know more than god
[1:11:04] does
[1:11:06] sometimes we want to say well i don't
[1:11:09] know why this is i i know why this is
[1:11:11] happening i don't know what is that i
[1:11:13] don't know what this is i don't know
[1:11:14] what that is i don't know about this
[1:11:16] coronavirus i don't know about this i
[1:11:17] don't know about that
[1:11:19] it's a light affliction
[1:11:22] compared to what a lot of people are
[1:11:23] going through
[1:11:25] there's people in foreign countries now
[1:11:26] that that are beginning to starve
[1:11:28] because they're not getting any food
[1:11:31] from us or not us church but us the
[1:11:34] united states
[1:11:35] i was reading the other day let's stand
[1:11:37] our feet
[1:11:39] musicians come i was reading the other
[1:11:40] day
[1:11:41] one country
[1:11:44] their food's been cut off not their food
[1:11:46] all their food but the food for their
[1:11:49] children's school
[1:11:51] has been cut off and that's the only
[1:11:54] meal those children
[1:11:56] got in a day
[1:12:00] one meal that's all they got folks here
[1:12:02] we are we got candy in our pocket
[1:12:04] we got food in the car we got a pantry
[1:12:06] full we eat three meals a day
[1:12:09] and you've got countries that because of
[1:12:11] this coronavirus is not that's just not
[1:12:13] you know they're not they're not affect
[1:12:16] sorry they're not infected with it
[1:12:19] they are affected by it
[1:12:21] because we can't get stuff over there
[1:12:23] because of all the restrictions and all
[1:12:25] that there's children that are starving
[1:12:27] because they were dependent on that one
[1:12:29] meal at school that they ate and that's
[1:12:31] all they got the whole time
[1:12:34] so don't worry i mean we go through
[1:12:36] these light afflictions and when there's
[1:12:37] things that you know we're looking at a
[1:12:39] tough road ahead but you know what
[1:12:41] the tough get tougher
[1:12:44] amen we keep going
[1:12:46] you got to know that god knows what to
[1:12:50] do and he knows what you need
[1:12:54] we don't
[1:12:56] but god does
[1:12:57] he knows what we need for the hour and
[1:12:59] the light of fiction afflictions and
[1:13:01] trials that we're going through
[1:13:04] is to give god honor and glory
[1:13:07] i mean who are you going to give the
[1:13:08] devil
[1:13:09] honor
[1:13:10] oh my no
[1:13:12] no
[1:13:15] because
[1:13:16] look the devil would have killed job
[1:13:19] right at first if god would let him
[1:13:23] oh you got a hedge built around him
[1:13:26] right he's okay i'm gonna take that
[1:13:28] hedge off
[1:13:29] and let you get to his family and let
[1:13:30] you get to
[1:13:33] but what about him no god said no
[1:13:35] don't touch his life
[1:13:37] why he still had that hedge around his
[1:13:40] life
[1:13:42] he may have removed it from all of his
[1:13:43] personal things and god may do that to
[1:13:46] us
[1:13:47] but until god's done with us
[1:13:49] that hedge is right there around your
[1:13:51] soul that inward being that life in you
[1:13:54] is not a normal human life anymore
[1:13:57] i want you all to realize that now it
[1:13:58] doesn't make you so special like i said
[1:14:00] to make your head blow up but you are
[1:14:02] special to god
[1:14:04] you have a part to play a peace to play
[1:14:07] and you're part of the body of god
[1:14:10] and we can't lose
[1:14:12] we can't there's no way like like
[1:14:15] brother brown said
[1:14:18] there was a time you were nothing
[1:14:22] didn't know where he was going
[1:14:25] didn't know what she's going to do with
[1:14:26] your life
[1:14:28] but now that you're born again
[1:14:31] you'll never not be somewhere
[1:14:34] or have somewhere to go
[1:14:37] never
[1:14:38] so thank god for that
[1:14:40] even though the trials but remember
[1:14:42] don't we go back to that where he says
[1:14:45] what we overcome
[1:14:47] no it's how we overcome it
[1:14:50] so we overcome it by the word of god
[1:14:52] what he said about us and believe what
[1:14:54] he said doesn't matter
[1:14:56] come what may folks the bride of jesus
[1:14:59] christ will make it through
[1:15:02] we will make it through because he
[1:15:05] promised us by this word that someone
[1:15:07] will stand in the end time and say death

[1:15:37] can't touch their soul
[1:15:39] you leave them alone you can do all
[1:15:41] these other things
[1:15:42] but
[1:15:43] you know what one day he's going to do
[1:15:44] he's going to close that back around
[1:15:46] and he's going to say they proved
[1:15:48] himself
[1:15:50] satan they've proved their self
[1:15:52] and you have no part with them let's

[1:17:50] taken us out of this
[1:17:52] and thank god
[1:17:54] thank god
[1:17:55] he has taken us out of this
[1:17:58] and set us up in a place where satan
[1:18:00] can't touch us

[1:18:04] do anything to a child of god without
[1:18:06] god allowing
[1:18:08] something
[1:18:09] for your good
[1:18:12] jesus said why in the world would a
[1:18:14] father
[1:18:15] if a child ask for a
[1:18:17] a fish would give him a serpent
[1:18:20] or ask for a bread my kids are hungry
[1:18:23] and give him a rock
[1:18:24] no he's going to give you the best bread
[1:18:27] he's given us the best bread right here
[1:18:29] he's give us the word of god
[1:18:33] and we must believe we got to start
[1:18:35] we're believers
[1:18:36] [Music]
[1:18:38] don't we do what believers do we believe
[1:18:40] that's what believers do believers
[1:18:42] believe unbelievers do what
[1:18:45] unbelief
[1:18:47] it's kind of simple sister
[1:18:53] it's alicia quick so can i give a quick
[1:18:55] testimonial
[1:18:56] um
[1:18:57] sure
[1:18:58] yeah come on y'all be seated
[1:19:04] you take that off there you go
[1:19:05] so you hear what you're saying
[1:19:13] hey guys it's been like a really hard
[1:19:14] journey for me and my family
[1:19:17] my mom's been like really sick on and
[1:19:18] off of copd and heart failure
[1:19:21] i feel like it's for like the past two
[1:19:22] years she's been sick like all of her
[1:19:24] life since we were young i should be in
[1:19:26] and out of the hospital
[1:19:27] but the lord blessed us with like um i
[1:19:30] guess like the past two years we've seen
[1:19:31] her have some really good days or some
[1:19:33] really good months seeing her looking
[1:19:34] really beautiful really strong really
[1:19:37] happy
[1:19:38] but then like this tragic thing kind of
[1:19:40] happened to her she fell down at home
[1:19:42] and she hit her head and her nurse
[1:19:44] wanted her
[1:19:45] to go to the hospital so she went ahead
[1:19:47] into the hospital
[1:19:50] um as days went to a week we thought she
[1:19:52] was going to get out like everything's
[1:19:53] going to be fine again we've seen her
[1:19:55] raise up many times
[1:19:57] but she's almost like she was in a
[1:19:58] coma-like state my mom was risen back up
[1:20:00] by the grace of the lord through prayer
[1:20:03] i've seen god raise her up so many times
[1:20:06] but this time was a little bit different
[1:20:10] i guess like with all of the um covet
[1:20:11] virus and everything we couldn't go
[1:20:13] visit her
[1:20:14] at all she ended up being moved from the
[1:20:16] regular hospital one day i talked to her
[1:20:18] on thursday night i can't see the dates
[1:20:20] right now i can't keep up with dates but
[1:20:21] i was like my mom was talking really
[1:20:23] well like mom about to go home she's
[1:20:24] like yeah i'm about to go back home
[1:20:26] so we're just all happy and everything
[1:20:28] should be getting out but
[1:20:29] the unexpected it took like a big turn
[1:20:31] instead of her going home
[1:20:34] it's like a few days later she was sent
[1:20:35] or the next day she was actually put
[1:20:37] into intensive care
[1:20:39] we still couldn't go see her because of
[1:20:42] the rules
[1:20:43] and it was like very very hard we
[1:20:45] couldn't go visit her first of all do i
[1:20:47] still trust you lord you know i trusted
[1:20:49] him through everything i can't say
[1:20:51] that a day without joy when i finally
[1:20:52] was able to see her but she wants to
[1:20:54] intensive care
[1:20:55] and then like days when i put like a
[1:20:56] tube thing in her neck
[1:20:59] like a catheter thing they put it
[1:21:00] through
[1:21:01] to her um
[1:21:03] so like check on her lungs and her heart
[1:21:05] like seal it where the fluids were
[1:21:06] collecting and her making what she
[1:21:07] couldn't breathe properly and when they
[1:21:09] did that i guess a couple days past she
[1:21:11] was still insisting here they're trying
[1:21:12] to help herself it was the most
[1:21:13] strongest oxygen they could possibly put
[1:21:15] on your nose like for the put that
[1:21:16] pressure through
[1:21:18] that still wasn't helping her lungs
[1:21:19] still kept collecting up the fluids and
[1:21:22] realized they couldn't help her anymore
[1:21:24] there was no more help from my mother
[1:21:26] from the medical field i mean it's just
[1:21:28] it was heartbreaking but i'm telling you
[1:21:30] i still was holding on to god that god
[1:21:31] you were real
[1:21:32] lord jesus i know what happened in
[1:21:33] brother branagh's prayer lines you know
[1:21:35] i've heard it all i believe it god if
[1:21:37] you want to raise her up you can raise
[1:21:38] her up
[1:21:41] but i guess like after all that happened
[1:21:44] we were contacting my mom's conscience
[1:21:46] about hospice we start pressuring her
[1:21:48] to go to hospitals they can't help her
[1:21:50] anymore
[1:21:51] and then also there's a double pressure
[1:21:54] if she didn't go to hospice we couldn't
[1:21:55] see her
[1:21:57] and we still didn't all get to see her
[1:21:59] only two people at a time were allowed
[1:22:01] to see my precious mother
[1:22:03] i'm telling y'all if that is something
[1:22:05] hard that is something hard
[1:22:08] the first time i had to hear was my
[1:22:09] husband i just had to i got a chance to
[1:22:11] pray with her
[1:22:13] to really this is my testimony i really
[1:22:15] had a chance to pray with her to read
[1:22:16] the bible it's hard to bring my bible
[1:22:18] like i actually gave her to my bible i
[1:22:20] gave her my bible temporarily
[1:22:22] i was like mommy gonna borrow this until
[1:22:24] you are healed in jesus name and you can
[1:22:25] come on back home because i was praying
[1:22:27] for a complete healing some moment she
[1:22:29] had many hardships i mean she really
[1:22:31] tried her best to raise that's what
[1:22:32] little she had she said my mother would
[1:22:33] sacrifice everything
[1:22:35] for us my dad was not really around as
[1:22:37] we became teenagers at all they were
[1:22:39] never married
[1:22:40] he was not really a moral support
[1:22:42] spiritual supporter anyway to my mother
[1:22:44] she went through a lot she went through
[1:22:45] a lot for us
[1:22:47] that really ain't gonna work for her as
[1:22:48] my mom she was a good mom to the best
[1:22:49] that she knew how to be
[1:22:51] that one change it you know the lord
[1:22:53] knows
[1:22:55] but as time went on
[1:22:57] she went she oh god y'all just don't
[1:22:58] even know
[1:23:00] mama was like you and chanda my mom
[1:23:02] calls me tc i go by tc to my whole
[1:23:04] family to my old church i used to go to
[1:23:06] but as i became a little bit older my
[1:23:08] kids got older i started going by elisha
[1:23:10] my middle name but actually my whole
[1:23:11] family
[1:23:12] calls me tc that's my nickname so i'm
[1:23:14] used to that but i just didn't come here
[1:23:16] with that i just
[1:23:18] kind of felt i don't know just knew
[1:23:21] and um
[1:23:22] she was like he's saying jenny y'all
[1:23:23] have to sign this hospice paper for me
[1:23:25] to go in
[1:23:26] we couldn't do it i could not do my
[1:23:28] sister my hand would not allow me to do
[1:23:30] it most of her hand actually cannot
[1:23:32] force her to sign these papers or they
[1:23:33] go to hospice
[1:23:35] so we both couldn't do it so i called
[1:23:36] leaving my mom she can't decide and me
[1:23:38] and my sister we cannot do it we will
[1:23:40] not sign the sausage paper
[1:23:42] after that my mom with a little bit
[1:23:44] stretchy has she signed the hospice
[1:23:46] paper herself so she can go ahead and
[1:23:49] say mama doesn't matter the hospice the
[1:23:50] hospital intensive care god can heal you
[1:23:52] mama
[1:23:53] in jesus name i still trusted him i mean
[1:23:56] he saved me a wretch like me there was
[1:23:57] nothing good in me i satisfied the truth
[1:24:00] nothing was good in me this is his grace
[1:24:03] i wanted to go through the complications
[1:24:04] of it it's only his grace and mercy he
[1:24:06] showed me his love and by his mercy and
[1:24:09] his tender mercy and grace i was able to
[1:24:11] hear
[1:24:12] able to hear what he was saying unto me
[1:24:15] to be able to be saved i knew it was the
[1:24:17] truth because it was the truth the truth
[1:24:18] the truth the full truth nothing was
[1:24:20] hidden how a woman should be to take off
[1:24:22] the makeup to wear a dress it wasn't a
[1:24:24] halfway truth i went to a halfway kind
[1:24:25] of church before me and him and i was
[1:24:27] like wow they could not move me nobody
[1:24:29] could change me if i want to dress how i
[1:24:30] want to dress i have to do it
[1:24:32] even even i loved him he could not
[1:24:34] change me i loved him full of love but
[1:24:36] it's like i got to do what i got to do
[1:24:42] but when i heard that real truth from
[1:24:43] the message about how ladyship is like
[1:24:45] man it's only the full truth it doesn't
[1:24:46] seem like there's a part way
[1:24:48] it's the whole the whole truth so i
[1:24:50] trusted with mama
[1:24:52] until the end by his grace and when i
[1:24:54] went to the hospital we finally got
[1:24:55] there i just i didn't realize that i was
[1:24:57] like well i was a hospice nurse i was
[1:24:59] like i still trust god from home
[1:25:01] i trust god you can raise her up i was
[1:25:03] so positive like so refreshing not
[1:25:05] anything good in me but then when i look
[1:25:07] back at it i wish i would have
[1:25:08] recognized the signs
[1:25:09] from my own heart to recognize the signs
[1:25:11] that god might take my mind home the man
[1:25:13] was trying to tell me it's a contract
[1:25:15] i was like i'm not hearing that i trust
[1:25:17] god god can raise my mother back up that
[1:25:20] was me i'm not gonna lie to y'all i was
[1:25:23] just like that god save me he can raise
[1:25:25] my mom up and give her a chance to have
[1:25:26] a happy life
[1:25:28] i want to see my mama home
[1:25:30] i want to say i have a husband that
[1:25:31] loved her i want his hair to serve the
[1:25:33] lord
[1:25:34] he's like well there's a beautiful woman
[1:25:36] she's a gorgeous woman
[1:25:38] gorgeous but she went through so many
[1:25:40] trials
[1:25:42] but i know god is controlling it but yet
[1:25:43] even in though it's like this
[1:25:45] i said look brother i know
[1:25:48] if god's ill is in control if he won't
[1:25:50] take her home he can take her home i'm
[1:25:51] still holding on i'm not gonna bury my
[1:25:53] mom they're gonna bury my mother i was
[1:25:55] like even when they show me paper signs
[1:25:57] i will show the doctor like is she on
[1:25:58] this side on the lasting my sister were
[1:26:00] there we were there to gather my brother
[1:26:02] together in the hospice alone
[1:26:05] on the last day of my mother's life it
[1:26:06] was so hard i only showed the doctor say
[1:26:09] i will not speak these words what level
[1:26:11] is she on hours to days or minutes
[1:26:13] where's my mom at
[1:26:15] at the last moment it's like where is
[1:26:16] she at
[1:26:18] they told me they were like she was like
[1:26:19] well maybe hours to days or not minutes
[1:26:22] so me and my sister went back to the
[1:26:23] room
[1:26:25] y'all i wanted to tell the full truth
[1:26:27] that all of y'all today are my
[1:26:28] eyewitness of this me and my sister
[1:26:30] where i'm witnesses to my mom's death to
[1:26:32] her passing on we're right there is
[1:26:34] nothing you want to behold there's
[1:26:36] nothing you want to be there for it's
[1:26:37] not that i want my children to be there
[1:26:38] i like lord take me quickly if you are
[1:26:39] taking me
[1:26:41] because we were in there
[1:26:42] we came in from the doctor they pulled
[1:26:44] us out of the room
[1:26:46] and my mom was by herself for a few
[1:26:47] minutes a few few precious minutes and i
[1:26:50] showed the doctor i said hours to minute
[1:26:51] hours to days
[1:26:53] i mean she was like well in the hours it
[1:26:54] could be hours today it's kind of in
[1:26:55] there me and channel back to the room we
[1:26:57] started talking about old brother who
[1:26:58] just passed two years ago
[1:27:00] many of you guys know if he was 35 years
[1:27:02] old his name was david extremely
[1:27:04] handsome
[1:27:05] tall like everything probably a girl
[1:27:07] with one very handsome
[1:27:10] but the lord chose to take him
[1:27:13] the lord chose to take him back in 2018.
[1:27:16] it was very difficult for my mom
[1:27:19] so me and chandler were actually in
[1:27:20] front of my mom was laying down
[1:27:23] me and chanda we're just talking about
[1:27:24] dave was like man what a shame
[1:27:27] man david is calling we wanted him to
[1:27:28] have everything he was like hourglass
[1:27:30] but i'm seeing her think mom has hours
[1:27:32] today
[1:27:33] but these are the last words we're
[1:27:34] saying so i'm just telling this truth
[1:27:35] i'm not gonna lie but just like that so
[1:27:37] i'm so sad i'm still saying so maybe you
[1:27:39] have not gotten over it because you
[1:27:40] weren't here for the funeral you know
[1:27:41] you didn't get to go to the funeral
[1:27:43] cause we're in the philippines at the
[1:27:44] time like maybe just not over it because
[1:27:46] i was like
[1:27:47] my sister's like yelling me don't you
[1:27:48] see the reality mama good time i'm good
[1:27:49] at the and i trust in the lord
[1:27:51] god's gonna raise my back up trust in
[1:27:52] him but he choose to take her home at
[1:27:54] peace but on the last day me and john
[1:27:56] were there i want this the most
[1:27:57] important part the most important part
[1:27:59] when we came to see her like two days
[1:28:01] before she died my mother said like god
[1:28:04] is the healer she is trusting god her
[1:28:06] life is in what god that's believe me i
[1:28:08] will tell you i'm just i drove my mama
[1:28:10] crazy about the lord
[1:28:11] i was like mama you gotta make it right
[1:28:12] have you made it right have you made it
[1:28:14] she's like baby baby you know this is a
[1:28:16] mama would you like man you keep asking
[1:28:18] me this stuff that's like mama have you
[1:28:19] made it right she said she has made it
[1:28:21] right so i know she's on the other side
[1:28:24] she's just waiting for us she's waiting
[1:28:26] for my sister to get right so i ask you
[1:28:28] guys to besiege you pray for chanda that
[1:28:30] is my younger sister
[1:28:32] chandan and her husband daniel that the
[1:28:33] holy ghost will just rapture them up the
[1:28:35] lord will speak through you and bring
[1:28:37] that word across it doesn't be anything
[1:28:39] but me if i'm praying in jesus name to
[1:28:41] get a hold of her she made a promise
[1:28:42] she's going to get saved my brother died
[1:28:44] at his funeral but she hasn't really
[1:28:46] walked but god said she's too busy
[1:28:48] her life is too difficult
[1:28:50] to try to give everything to god so as
[1:28:51] for that prayer but as we're they're
[1:28:53] talking about david my mom started
[1:28:55] coughing i went through every detail
[1:28:57] me and chanda ran to mama like mama mama
[1:29:01] and some different things happened i was
[1:29:02] like is this okay we started blessing
[1:29:04] for the nurse
[1:29:06] we looked outside like oh yo you nervous
[1:29:08] come and help us they never came it took
[1:29:10] them a long time then they finally came
[1:29:13] mama was gone she breathed her last
[1:29:15] breath and she was gone and my testimony
[1:29:17] on death because i'm not going through
[1:29:19] the graphic details it's so humbling
[1:29:23] do not think you are somebody that is my
[1:29:25] testimony
[1:29:27] do not think you got some money do not
[1:29:28] think i have a good job do not think you
