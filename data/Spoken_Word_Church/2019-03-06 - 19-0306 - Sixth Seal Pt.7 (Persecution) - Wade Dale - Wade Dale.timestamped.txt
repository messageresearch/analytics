[4:53] kind of file it in the back of your mind
[4:55] do you know what this seal is this is
[4:58] these change seal
[5:02] now we took a change in the fourth seal
[5:04] and went in the rapture we know that but
[5:07] underneath that is that thunder that
[5:09] we're looking for because in the sixth
[5:11] seal remember you laugh it back under
[5:13] we got the sixth seal has to break to us
[5:16] and that sixth seal that breaks to us is
[5:18] our body change so this is the that to

[5:25] it's changed things it changed nature
[5:27] it's change 144,000 it changed a lot of
[5:29] things we're going to talk about a
[5:31] little bit tonight but it's going to
[5:32] change us but before it changes us we're
[5:36] gonna have to go through a little bit of
[5:37] persecution alright so the Bible tells
[5:40] us that all that live godly in christ
[5:44] shall suffer persecution alright so but
[5:48] we're gonna add a little bit to that not
[5:52] dad to the word but we're gonna kind of
[5:53] expound on that a little bit so let's
[5:55] read revelation 6 verse 12 let's go to
[5:59] the Lord in prayer
[6:00] generally father we thank you tonight
[6:01] for giving us an opportunity to come in
[6:03] the middle of the week and to Talk About
[6:05] You Father we know that Satan hates us
[6:09] the demons hate us but you love us and
[6:12] graters either send us and eat us in the
[6:14] world there's not a thing can stand

[6:20] you're our husband you're our lover
[6:25] lords you did all the things for this
[6:27] bride you protected us Lord now I pray
[6:30] that you would just let this word soak
[6:34] down inside of a Florida and let it be
[6:35] lived the prophet of God told us that's
[6:39] the thunder of God would be thousands of
[6:41] lived voices that's the best thunder you
[6:44] can have is to is to not just be able to
[6:47] speak the word but to live it and Lord
[6:50] we pray that you just help us to do that
[6:52] Lord even though if we have to go
[6:54] through persecution so be it for us to
[6:57] get out of here because this world at
[6:59] this point is not our home father just

[8:20] lift the people up also father just be
[8:23] with us now and the further man this
[8:25] service blesses in Jesus name Amen
[8:27] and I beheld when he opened the sixth
[8:30] seal and lo there was a great earthquake
[8:31] and the Sun became black as sackcloth of
[8:33] hair and the moon became his blood and
[8:35] the stars of heaven fell upon the earth
[8:37] unto the earth even as a fig tree
[8:38] casteth her untimely figs when she is
[8:40] shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven
[8:43] departed as a scroll when it rolled
[8:45] together and every mountain and Island
[8:46] were moved out of their places and the
[8:48] kings of the earth and the great men and
[8:50] the rich men the chief captains and the
[8:51] mighty men and every bondman and every
[8:53] free man hid himself in the dens and in
[8:54] the rocks of the mountains and said to
[8:57] the mountains and rocks fall on us and
[8:58] hide us from the face of him that
[8:59] sitteth on the throne and from the wrath
[9:01] of the lamb for the great day of his
[9:03] wrath is come and who shall be able to
[9:05] stand you may be exceeding the Lord as a
[9:07] blessing to the reading the word don t
[9:09] reach over in Kurt that cut the fan on
[9:12] please this kind of stuff you up here a
[9:14] little bit hot but thank the Lord for
[9:17] the reading of the word and we've come
[9:19] into this sixth seal now we know this a
[9:21] tribulation seals of tribulation period
[9:23] but I was thinking today there in
[9:27] revelation 6 or in Revelations 4
[9:29] when the bride goes up in the rapture
[9:32] when it says after just okay let Aaron
[9:37] Hale let Aaron handle it he might let
[9:40] the maintenance director take over put
[9:42] your safety glasses on hardhat safe
[9:46] goodbye sir
[9:47] okay tilt oh hey tilt um cheese anyway
[9:52] but I was thinking about this and when
[9:55] revelations for one says after these
[9:57] things we go up so after the church ages
[10:01] we go up in Revelations for one we're
[10:03] not seeing revelations 19 now that is
[10:06] that is true has to be because we're not
[10:09] here on this physical earth during that
[10:11] time of 5:3 whatever the whatever the
[10:14] six seven eight nine it's like a brother
[10:16] Center sent a message online and God
[10:20] bless you brother field if you're
[10:21] watching in tonight I made a statement
[10:24] that the that the woes was the second
[10:27] world war but in the chronological order
[10:31] the scripture it looks like it doesn't
[10:32] happen happen yet but you have to
[10:33] remember when you talk about scripture
[10:36] and prophecy it's broad and it is
[10:40] spiritual but it also that whoa brother
[10:42] Brown said the three woes of the three
[10:44] world wars so you can't get away from
[10:46] that first well what's the first world
[10:48] war ii whoa what's the second world war
[10:50] and the third woe is going to be the one
[10:52] coming which would be the third world
[10:54] war war the war that will end all wars
[10:56] that we know of on the face of the earth
[10:58] but you have to look and see that though
[11:01] in chronological order sometimes it
[11:03] doesn't look right but it took a prophet
[11:05] to pull those pieces out and put them
[11:08] together so that we can understand what
[11:09] the Bible says because we wouldn't even
[11:11] know what a war was if it wasn't been
[11:12] for the Prophet and man I mean people
[11:14] have presumed and all these different
[11:16] things but we're brother Graham said the
[11:17] three woes with the three wars to me it
[11:20] just made it plain it just made it plain
[11:22] what the what the walls were and how
[11:25] that they held that first woe because
[11:26] that was a war to end all wars World War
[11:28] one like brother Dale was talking about
[11:30] it they nobody knows why it ended on
[11:34] November the 11th at the 11th nobody
[11:36] knows that will be angel did brother
[11:40] Branham knew what was going on he knew
[11:42] that
[11:42] we'll stop that war because they were
[11:45] getting ready to come out with a mustard
[11:46] gas if you'll read all that World War
[11:48] one was a horrible war because there was
[11:50] no and I know all war is horrible but
[11:53] World War two they kind of had a little
[11:55] bit of contract between we're not going
[11:57] to use this great big thing or than this
[11:58] but World War one there was no contract
[12:00] they was just getting ready to unleash
[12:02] everything on the people because there
[12:04] was no United Nations there was no
[12:06] control of any other country so it was
[12:09] going to be probably the war that would
[12:11] break out now they didn't have nuclear
[12:12] at the time but they could have
[12:13] destroyed a lot of places but what I'm
[12:15] saying is all this though revelation 6
[12:18] when that sixth seal opens we know we're
[12:21] not here but that six seal opens because
[12:24] of you and me you said no it's the two
[12:27] prophets I know that but the two
[12:30] prophets are mute until we leave this
[12:32] place the two prophets are not even
[12:35] anointed at this moment to do anything
[12:37] until the blindness is lifted off of the
[12:41] of the Jew and it's always going to be
[12:43] there until we leave so this is all
[12:47] going to happen because of me and you
[12:49] because of the bride of Jesus Christ
[12:51] that's how important it is for us to get
[12:54] these things get them right and get out
[12:56] of here get out of the way and let God
[12:58] do what he's going to do alright but
[13:01] this is going to take though a little
[13:02] bit of persecution it's going to take
[13:05] you know think back even we were talking
[13:07] about the fourth seal it's obvious and
[13:10] if you're not if you haven't had a
[13:12] nature change you're not born again you
[13:17] must know that your old nature is not
[13:20] just hid it's dead you don't have that
[13:23] nature anymore if you still have that
[13:25] same nature now sure listen folks don't
[13:29] kid yourself
[13:30] my brother Dale said once he got born
[13:31] again he never drank a beer in his life
[13:33] hated beer but see somebody drinking a
[13:37] beer now you know you look over and you
[13:39] go you know I mean it wise it's in your
[13:43] brain though it's not in your heart
[13:45] there's no way you'd walk over there and
[13:47] do it now the one that was there that
[13:49] made you do it to start with he's dead
[13:54] but he
[13:55] can still play in that in that memories
[13:57] and conscience affection imagination he
[13:59] can play in that realm but what happens
[14:02] remember he played in that room when we
[14:04] were growing up and going through the
[14:06] things but what happened was when we
[14:08] brought Lewis let's have a party tonight
[14:10] brother Louisa died I got the drink so
[14:12] you know that's what it was you just
[14:14] went and did it why because there was
[14:16] the nature and there to do it but see
[14:18] that nature is gone now there's no way
[14:20] you would do that there's no way you
[14:22] would pick that up anymore the things I
[14:24] used to do I do them no more now it
[14:27] doesn't mean that you're not bothered
[14:28] with them but in this sixth seal purging
[14:31] you and I are gonna have to come to a
[14:32] sixth seal purging of that metal man to
[14:35] know that that middle man that memories
[14:37] and conservation imagination is just
[14:39] what it is memory reasoning conscious
[14:43] effects and imagination contrary to
[14:46] God's still contrary to God but what's
[14:50] inside of the inside of that person
[14:53] there's the real you the nature that
[14:55] it's not even you anymore it's God but
[15:00] let God work out to destroy those little
[15:03] ice you might say I've been reading back
[15:06] through numbers and Deuteronomy and all
[15:07] that man you get into that land and
[15:09] there's the hip dice and a high bias and
[15:11] the Jabba sites and all these other ice
[15:12] that Joshua had to deal with it wasn't
[15:15] just Joshua walked in and said Paul dead
[15:19] no he had to fight but you know what
[15:26] Rahab made an outstanding statement she
[15:29] must have heard among the community that
[15:32] the community said we were whipped when
[15:34] y'all cross the Jordan in other words we
[15:36] might have had some spies looking around
[15:38] we had the satellite up and the image
[15:41] showed us the sea just opened up and
[15:43] y'all walked right across didn't even
[15:45] get your feet muddy hey she said we were
[15:48] whipped when y'all did that but now did
[15:50] Josh win them know it no they didn't
[15:52] know it they had to still walk around
[15:53] Jericho in other words one of my saying
[15:55] you still gotta live your life you still
[15:57] gotta listen to the preacher you still
[15:58] gotta
[15:59] around your Jericho and then not take a
[16:03] bomb and blow it or blow it away speak
[16:07] to it that's what we got to come now
[16:09] into speaking condition in this sixth
[16:11] seal because if you're going to have
[16:13] persecution I say if you're asking if
[16:16] not me the persecution and I'll read you
[16:19] some quotes and I I don't know brother
[16:22] Jose here or not but I thank God he sent
[16:24] me a bunch of clothes and I had forgot
[16:26] that he sent them to me about
[16:27] persecution what brother Brown said
[16:29] we're gonna read them they're in the
[16:30] very back side of your of your paper
[16:32] that I gave you and it'll be some quotes
[16:34] that that brother Brown said thus that
[16:36] the Lord
[16:38] you're gonna there's something there's
[16:40] gonna be a boycott there's going to be
[16:41] it's going to be a troubling time but
[16:45] but everybody's on own to this third
[16:49] pull business which is okay but
[16:53] everybody's got the third pull being you
[16:55] know brother I'm coming back in tents
[16:56] and blah blah all that stuff brother
[16:59] Brown said the third pulls opening of
[17:00] the word the third pull is now laying
[17:03] dormant the Prophet said we're going to
[17:05] read it it's right there in front of you
[17:06] it's laying dormant we don't need it
[17:10] right now
[17:10] in that aspect we need the opening of
[17:13] the word but we don't need a pork chop
[17:16] on our plate we don't need God to fill
[17:17] the gas up now they do in other
[17:19] countries like we were talking before in
[17:21] other countries
[17:23] and let me just be real some of you to
[17:28] spend other countries they have more
[17:30] faith than we do they just have a faith
[17:34] that like brother Reed told brother Dale
[17:36] said brother Dale we don't have a CBS on
[17:38] every corner if our kids have a
[17:40] toothache we may have a little remedy
[17:42] that we give them an herb or something
[17:44] but we don't have a CBS to run and get
[17:46] the Ambus all or whatever it is that we
[17:48] just readily probably still have in our
[17:50] cabinet right now they don't have that
[17:53] so they have to have a certain degree of
[17:55] faith the brothers in the word brother
[17:58] Lewis work they had to have a certain
[17:59] amount of faith just to buy oil they
[18:04] couldn't buy oil to go in the so God
[18:08] supply them the only God supply them the
[18:10] oil okay he'll supply your needs now he
[18:13] didn't
[18:13] apply the oil in a brand new car he put
[18:16] the oil in the old car but the old truck
[18:18] got you there then it I mean it did what
[18:20] it was supposed to do you see what I'm
[18:22] saying with us you and I it's not gonna
[18:24] be I don't believe it's gonna be
[18:27] everything we thought it is but it's
[18:29] going to be some things that we need to
[18:30] be prepared for just in case we don't
[18:35] need to be I mean you know you can be a
[18:37] prepper if you want to and we put up
[18:38] stuff and you put up a little bit if you
[18:40] want to and and that's okay
[18:42] but there's gonna look at all now now
[18:44] when we did that back in the 70s look
[18:47] what happened there was no line of
[18:49] communication like cell phones listen I
[18:52] know why the cell phone come into be you
[18:57] can't hide nothing and everybody has a
[19:01] cell phone everybody how many times have
[19:05] you lost your cell phone you get a sick
[19:07] or feeling that if somebody would have
[19:08] stole your car out in the parking lot
[19:12] right a man you go and you go to digging
[19:16] and you don't care what else happens you
[19:18] got to find that phone well you know
[19:20] what that someone is right it's a GPS it
[19:23] has a receiver my scanner that I use for
[19:27] my postal service job it tells me
[19:31] exactly if I put the package on the
[19:32] porch or if I deliver it into their box
[19:34] it's within three or four feet accuracy
[19:38] and they can tell me how many times I
[19:40] backed up and if I sit still for ten
[19:42] minutes it sends an alarm a lot alarm to
[19:46] the post office that I haven't moved in
[19:48] ten minutes so if I stop and talk to
[19:50] some of my beekeeping friends I'm
[19:51] overdoing the scanner like this
[19:56] I'm taking my lunch break they just
[20:02] happened to be on my route sorry but
[20:06] anyway but that's the truth but you see
[20:07] but what I'm saying is now all the
[20:09] things that we thought we could do and
[20:11] do the you know do the sniper thing
[20:13] where the ghillie suit and you know we
[20:15] hide so nobody find us if you've got any
[20:18] kind of electronics on you hold you
[20:22] watch it oh the government just knew
[20:26] that he raised his hand it's in our
[20:29] watches now iPhone iPhone yeah I phone
[20:40] you said well I sell them we'll get rid
[20:42] of mine now they'll know what I'm saying
[20:45] is they're gonna know where you are they
[20:47] already know where we are they already
[20:49] know what we're what we stand for it's
[20:52] just one day they're gonna come in and
[20:53] say you can't do that anymore you just
[20:56] can't do that anymore unless you sign
[20:58] this paper right here now read where
[21:00] brother Brown said that some people will
[21:02] sign the paper and go right in why
[21:04] because they think you know what they
[21:06] think what will to keep my doors open
[21:08] and to keep my congregation coming in
[21:11] and to keep getting my tithe no to keep
[21:14] getting my to keep everything going I'm
[21:17] gonna sign this paper won't hurt
[21:19] anything that's what brother Brown said
[21:20] they'll do thinking that they can serve
[21:23] God underneath that but they're not
[21:25] gonna be able to do that and a real true
[21:27] son and daughter of God won't do it
[21:29] anyway we cannot yield to that that's
[21:32] where the persecution is going to be but
[21:34] don't worry about it
[21:35] they know everything about us man just
[21:40] look everybody knows everything about
[21:43] everything all the time so who we got
[21:46] depend on now we need to depend on God
[21:49] alone because Louise was talking about
[21:53] it Wednesday night you know Ellie I mean
[21:56] yeah Ellie's are and in Elijah Elijah is
[22:04] like open my servants eyes but what did
[22:07] he last you do
[22:08] Elijah walked into the camp of the
[22:13] people that were trying to find him and
[22:16] said who you looking for
[22:17] right who you looking for what we're
[22:20] looking for mark action Ralph and it's
[22:21] him standing there we're looking for
[22:23] Elijah God had changed their eyesight
[22:28] and that's what he's going to do but
[22:31] you're not gonna have to depend on God
[22:32] to do that because Elijah didn't depend
[22:33] on himself he just walked right in and
[22:36] dependent on God to change their
[22:38] eyesight because remember he changed it
[22:40] so much that Elijah I think he went got
[22:42] all the all the good guys and brought
[22:44] them into the camp wreath or took the
[22:46] bad guys into the good camp and God
[22:47] opened their eyes and they just laid
[22:49] there they just laid their weapons down
[22:51] what they walked right into I mean my
[22:53] heavens you're walking into a camp of
[22:55] your enemy same way with you and I
[22:59] saying wave Jesus and Paul and and all
[23:01] those that Jesus you know they were
[23:04] getting ready to stone him and throw him
[23:05] off a cliff and the Bible says he was he
[23:07] disappeared now he didn't disappear he
[23:11] was still there
[23:12] God just changed their eyesight so that
[23:15] he could walk right down through the
[23:16] through the crowd and they go oh that's
[23:18] Joel that's Joe that's John yeah just
[23:20] let him go see same way with you and I
[23:22] but you and I are dependency then it's
[23:24] got to be on guard to do that not
[23:27] brother down not me not william branham
[23:31] he's not here we got a pending on guard
[23:35] God's the one that's gonna take us out
[23:37] of this do not put your dependency on a
[23:39] man except that was not there because if
[23:43] you put your dependency on that man
[23:44] you'll never fail amen
[23:48] so the sixth seal then let's look at
[23:51] verse number one is a tribulation seal
[23:53] with no Tribulation Period and God is
[23:57] going to deal with Israel as a nation
[23:59] you and I are already gone now what I
[24:02] want you to see is the rest that we what
[24:04] we talked about tonight has happened or
[24:07] will be happening because you and I came
[24:10] to a place to take a body change a
[24:13] resurrection and a rapture so we're
[24:16] completely out of the way when this
[24:17] happens but that sixth seal has to come
[24:20] real to you too
[24:21] Cheng's you that's the change seal I
[24:25] want you to get that in your mind that
[24:26] six seals somewhere inside that seal
[24:29] something where that thunder is going to
[24:31] ring out that I have been changed my
[24:34] total nature has been changed to where
[24:38] payment listen when we walk into this
[24:41] world I was telling you this Sunday we
[24:42] walk into this world this is a world of
[24:45] death doesn't matter if you're a
[24:48] Christian now just lay it on the table
[24:50] this is a world of death amen you were
[24:58] born to die in your flesh you were born
[25:03] to die now what's gonna happen though
[25:06] we're same dimension but now watch when
[25:08] Jesus stepped out of the tomb he had a
[25:10] change buddy it was glorified now the
[25:15] world went right on like they like they
[25:17] were actually you know what they did
[25:20] they said no Jesus they took his body
[25:22] out and they throwed it out in the
[25:23] desert or they buried it or eat it see
[25:26] all the story same thing is gonna happen
[25:27] to us but when Jesus walked out what I'm
[25:30] saying is when Jesus walked out it
[25:32] wasn't that the whole world just
[25:33] collapsed it kept right on going same
[25:38] way with you and I when we take a body
[25:39] change it the world's going to keep on
[25:42] going actually several years later but
[25:45] these things are going to happen to
[25:47] cause the Tribulation Period right after
[25:52] we leave or even right at the point in
[25:54] time we all know one thing's for sure
[25:57] there were several earthquakes at the
[25:58] resurrection we know one thing's for
[26:01] sure that California is gonna have to
[26:02] sink to cause this thing to to get into
[26:05] turmoil and you can we can sit here and
[26:08] draw charts and read quotes and you I'm
[26:11] just telling you you better be ready if
[26:13] California sinks while we're here to me
[26:16] it's done and over with there's no
[26:18] running back to mom and daddy and
[26:19] there's no running - brother day on this
[26:21] road no running to God it's over the
[26:26] Gentile doors somewhere in there is
[26:28] gonna be shut cuz that's what's going to
[26:29] call you and I are it's kind of a
[26:32] paradox is thinking the other day you
[26:34] and I are whole
[26:35] holding off the wrath of God but because
[26:38] we're he leave it brings the wrath of
[26:41] God and there's a pre-tribulation
[26:43] happening now all the way around
[26:45] everywhere because what Satan still what
[26:48] he still sees you in your flesh body see
[26:51] this is what Satan's got he's got that
[26:53] one last mark which is this guy even
[26:58] with Jesus he'd say if you be if you be
[27:01] the Son of God do this if you be this
[27:03] even Satan said it Almighty God he was
[27:05] so veiled in human flesh until Satan
[27:08] didn't believe who he was he knew there
[27:10] was a power inside that man absolutely
[27:12] but if you be if you be if what he was
[27:16] he was telling him what the word said
[27:18] but what did Jesus do he didn't perform
[27:20] some great miracle he said it is written
[27:23] it is written it is written and that's
[27:27] what you and I are gonna come to Satan
[27:30] it's already written and our wing gotta
[27:33] write it it's already written all right
[27:36] and that's what's so great is what we're
[27:40] looking for to get us out of here is
[27:42] already here it's already in the Word of
[27:45] God it's already in the prophets message
[27:46] it's already here it's already inside of
[27:48] you
[27:49] amen because literally the world changed
[27:53] Helen today of Pentecost you had Jesus
[27:59] standing on earth for 30-something years
[28:01] he was the only one that was eternal in
[28:05] his soul on the whole face of the earth
[28:08] and then all of a sudden when he comes
[28:10] back on the day of Pentecost in the form
[28:12] of the Holy Ghost there's a hundred and
[28:14] twenty eternal people walking on the
[28:17] face of the earth and then 3,000 the
[28:19] next day or at the same time the 3,000
[28:23] became eternal people walking on the
[28:25] face of the earth what it's what a
[28:26] change but you know what it didn't
[28:29] bother a lot of people 90% of the world
[28:32] just kept right on going didn't bother
[28:35] him one bit oh yeah they made their
[28:37] little accusations and all this they're
[28:39] drunk their Pentecost they're drunk
[28:43] the Jesus camp we can't find his body
[28:46] all they eat it he said eat my flesh and
[28:48] dream
[28:49] blood he said they saw what he just eat
[28:51] they eat the body so you see that same
[28:54] thing going to do with us they gonna
[28:55] make excuses about things so let's just
[28:58] continue on here number two when we know
[29:01] that this six seal is the judgment seal
[29:03] and we were talking last Sunday you your
[29:06] judgment
[29:07] praise the Lord is over as far as you
[29:11] going you will take a body change
[29:14] somewhere if you're born again your body
[29:16] is going to have to go through a change
[29:19] whether it be you to lay it down into
[29:22] the earth and we bury it into the earth
[29:24] but the Bible says we bury it in
[29:26] corruption but we raised it in in
[29:29] corruption it will not be corrupt twice
[29:33] amen
[29:35] it will not be corrupt twice you might
[29:37] have to deal with it like you're dealing
[29:39] with it now but you will never have to
[29:41] deal with it again now some of us feel
[29:46] like we get old twice but you know what
[29:50] that's just not so
[29:52] you will not get old twice you're I hope
[29:58] we see that and I'm I'm not I don't make
[30:00] light of people but but we're we're
[30:03] closer to our eternal 20-year old person
[30:08] even us younger ones if you get born
[30:10] again you're right there at that door
[30:12] that you're never gonna have to get old
[30:17] children don't worry do not worry you
[30:22] think oh I'm gonna miss so much if I
[30:24] don't get married have kids have a car

[32:07] but since you don't but since you don't
[32:12] my way or the highway
[32:16] well the debt won't mind he said his
[32:19] kids in you too two numbers 18 and 30
[32:23] when you get 18 you got 38 days to leave
[32:25] I don't mind them staying my house they
[32:30] know but you know I said but that's the
[32:31] same way that we are we what we say well
[32:34] our kids it's all doom and gloom that's
[32:36] not doom and gloom if you look at the
[32:37] right way there's a lot of horrible
[32:41] things kids that you are being held away
[32:43] from that we keep you sheltered that
[32:47] you're gonna realize maybe one day if
[32:49] time does continue on you're gonna go
[32:51] whoa I don't know if I want to do this
[32:53] or not
[32:54] so you know so you understand what I'm
[32:57] saying teacher kids teach your kids that
[33:01] even though we may be heading toward a
[33:03] persecution that God is going to take
[33:05] care of us God's not going to leave us
[33:08] alone they're gonna leave a bunch of
[33:10] kids running around and we going in a
[33:12] rapture I just don't believe God's gonna
[33:14] do that I believe God's gonna take our
[33:16] kids and if they come to the age of
[33:19] accountability then now that's a
[33:20] different story they're gonna have to
[33:21] have it for their self but then you as
[33:23] you teach them and mold them all the way
[33:24] up teach them to be born again teach
[33:27] them the things to do and and just like
[33:30] the Bible says when they're older I had
[33:35] to wait till I was older because I had a
[33:36] hard head but when they're older they'll
[33:39] come back just live the life performance
[33:42] all you can do I mean but same way with
[33:45] this and we start talking about
[33:46] persecution and tribulation children
[33:48] don't be scared God is gonna take care
[33:50] of you I promise you it's thus saith the
[33:53] Lord
[33:53] it's thus that the eternal God that
[33:57] created everything you're standing on he
[34:00] will take care of you he promised it if
[34:08] he promised it you're right if you
[34:10] promised him if he promised it he'll do
[34:12] it so he'll take care of you do not
[34:14] worry do not worry worry brings fear
[34:17] fear brings torment do not do that but
[34:22] as we do speak on these things please
[34:23] remember teach your kids look God's
[34:27] gonna take care of us we're a family got
[34:30] listen God didn't God didn't give you a
[34:32] family not to take care of he gave you
[34:35] that family to nurture and take care of
[34:37] take care of that family and teach them
[34:40] the ways of the Lord teach them that
[34:41] God's gonna protect us teach them that
[34:44] God's already here to provide our needs
[34:47] not that he's coming and not that we're
[34:49] trying to we're trying to work something
[34:51] up no we he's in their everyday life he
[34:53] goes to school with him he goes in the
[34:56] you know he goes to he goes through
[34:58] puberty with him God went through
[35:00] puberty you know that don't you yeah
[35:02] Jesus went through puberty cuz he was a
[35:04] boy and he became a man all right there
[35:06] buddy okay with that he was a human
[35:08] so he understands that okay so now let's
[35:12] read if everybody's okay the sixth seal
[35:15] is the judgment seal of the word so
[35:18] whatever that seal opens is going to be
[35:21] judgment but God's already judged you
[35:25] now let's be careful with that let's
[35:27] don't go all the way over to the other
[35:29] side and say well I'm I'm I don't have
[35:32] to do anything no there's still things
[35:34] you gotta do read your Bible pray come
[35:38] to church do the things that you're
[35:39] supposed to do because remember you put
[35:41] God first then the Bible say seek ye
[35:45] first the kingdom of God
[35:47] and then all these other things to be
[35:49] added to you all right so if you're
[35:52] having problems in your life you know
[35:54] what when I start having problems in my
[35:56] life I come to church cuz I want to get
[35:59] rid of them problems I didn't want them
[36:01] no more hey man I don't like trouble I
[36:03] don't like persecution but that's okay
[36:07] you got to look at the promise people
[36:10] God has got to do what he's already said
[36:13] he's gonna do hey man so let's look
[36:15] let's read Isaiah we read this last
[36:18] Sunday but Isaiah even tells us about
[36:20] the tribulation but now listen let me
[36:23] say one more time teach your kids get
[36:25] born again they'll get a body change and
[36:28] they'll leave this place you don't have
[36:29] to worry about none of this sure we all
[36:33] we all think we all say we the only
[36:36] people's got problem right your problems
[36:42] are the bad as mine who's judging how
[36:51] you for the day of the Lord is at hand
[36:53] they shall come as of destruction from
[36:54] the almighty therefore show all hands be
[36:57] fainting every man's heart shall melt
[36:58] you know why God put this in the word to
[37:01] judge the people it's gonna stay here
[37:03] not you it's not you that's not you
[37:07] that's for the people that turned the
[37:09] grace of God down and they're still here
[37:11] then God has to tell them what's going
[37:14] to happen he's a just God so he even has
[37:16] to tell the devil
[37:18] he tells the devil what he's gonna do he
[37:22] doesn't hope this in' therefore shall
[37:25] all hens be fainting every man's heart
[37:26] shall melt and they shall be afraid
[37:29] pains and song shall take hold to them
[37:31] they shall be in pain as a woman that
[37:33] travaileth they shall be amazed one at
[37:35] another their faces shall be as flames
[37:37] behold the day of the Lord cometh cruel
[37:39] both with wrath and fierce anger to lay
[37:41] the land desolate and he shall destroy
[37:43] the sinners thereof out of it because
[37:45] remember the sixth seal purging will
[37:47] read it to me it's a three-fold manner
[37:49] but the earth has to be purged also it's
[37:52] the third one the earth this literal
[37:54] earth has to go through a purging all
[37:57] right for the stars of heaven and
[37:59] constellation there shall not give their
[38:01] light the Sun shall be darkened and is
[38:03] going forth in the moon shall not cause
[38:05] their light to shine and I will punish
[38:07] the world for their evil this is gonna
[38:09] be a worldwide punishment it's not just
[38:11] going to happen to the United States
[38:12] that this time it's gonna be worldwide
[38:13] all right and I will punish the world
[38:15] for their evil in the wicked for their
[38:17] iniquity and i will cause the arrogancy
[38:19] of the proud to cease and will lay low
[38:21] the haughtiness of the terrible the man
[38:24] the brother Brom tells us in the sixth
[38:28] seal he says see they're just exactly
[38:29] eyes they saw the same thing that Jesus
[38:32] spoke up that the Seventh Seal revealed
[38:34] who was the Seventh Seal Jesus Jesus is
[38:36] the Seventh Seal thereby okay with that
[38:38] Jesus says the seventh seal because six
[38:42] seals finishes everything that's why the
[38:43] seventh seal silent there's nothing
[38:45] going on there's it's all done brother
[38:47] Branham talks about we'll talk about it
[38:49] later it's the end it's the end of the
[38:51] struggling world the end of all things
[38:52] it's the end when the seventh seal came
[38:55] to you and gave you the new birth that
[38:57] was an end of your own nature that was
[39:00] the end of the old you you became a new
[39:03] creation or a new creature in Christ
[39:05] amen that's the Tribulation Period this
[39:11] sixth seal yes he was a prophet and the
[39:14] Word of God was made known to him he's
[39:16] talking about Isaiah alright let's go to
[39:18] the remnant just for a second then we'll
[39:20] get into these into this a few comments
[39:22] here let's go to number four excuse me
[39:26] what is a remnant the piece that's cut
[39:28] left some kind of good same kind of
[39:31] goods your
[39:32] ten what he's saying if you lay out up
[39:33] if you lay out a piece of goods you
[39:35] bought your material all right and if
[39:39] you're gonna cut out this piece of paper
[39:41] that's gonna be the one you you're gonna
[39:44] you're keying on this go this is going
[39:46] to make your shirt or whatever it's
[39:47] going to make but that doesn't exclude
[39:49] the remnant it's the same material as
[39:53] this it's just used different right it's
[39:58] just used different this is the bride of
[40:00] Jesus Christ he has cut us out of the
[40:05] cloth the remnant the foolish virgin
[40:10] they're virgins so they're not drunkards
[40:16] and whoremongers no they're trying to
[40:18] live a good life they're trying to live
[40:19] a Christian life they're trying to do
[40:21] the best they can
[40:22] it's just it like what brother Branham
[40:24] says the gospel never was preached
[40:26] totally tool or something happened that
[40:29] they couldn't get born again okay but
[40:31] it's the same material we're not going
[40:34] to walk into listen if you've got an
[40:35] idea and and let me put this in them you
[40:42] know we are the bride of Jesus Christ
[40:45] were the most special people on the face
[40:47] of the earth beside Jesus himself he
[40:49] said that he said that and we're in the
[40:52] seventh church age and were the most
[40:53] important people on the face of the
[40:54] earth to God right now right but we are
[40:57] no better than that man walking out on
[40:59] the street even brother Ram told us he's
[41:02] no different than us in a drunk you've
[41:04] got the new birth he don't that's the
[41:05] only thing he made a choice you made a
[41:07] choice okay so we're not gonna go to the
[41:10] foolish virgins and say oh you were just
[41:12] you were just the material no you won't
[41:16] be there if that's your attitude right
[41:19] but because this remnant is that remnant
[41:22] is the same cloth but what about if this
[41:25] can tell this about what they missed
[41:30] about the material because you listen
[41:33] you and I are gonna be the word made
[41:34] flesh you and I are already the word
[41:35] made flesh but when we get the glorified
[41:37] body and we get over on in the Millenium
[41:39] and all these other things we're not
[41:40] gonna just sit around and talk about
[41:42] right gene you know heard of things
[41:46] do you mind talk about no we're gonna
[41:48] have a godly mind but we're not going to
[41:51] be zombies where I'm gonna just be
[41:53] sitting there no we're gonna be what our
[41:55] mind is going to be so expanded that we
[41:58] don't need a Bible we are the Bible we
[42:01] can tell people about Abraham you know
[42:03] what if we can't remember about Abraham
[42:05] luisa go Abraham there is I'll tell you
[42:09] what happened when I was here I wonder
[42:13] what a logic allowed you glad to commit
[42:15] there's a lot you travel like a pilot
[42:17] right so if you need to talk to somebody
[42:21] no distance what wonderful is that how
[42:27] wonderful is that that we're so limited
[42:29] now it's why I'm telling you is why I'm
[42:31] trying to wind us into that six seal the
[42:33] sixth seal is just when we walk on this
[42:35] earth with a glorified body Nature has
[42:39] to fall this nature Kate standing it
[42:43] brother branham preached birth pains and
[42:44] we'll get into that when I come back but
[42:46] this world is in birth pains
[42:49] you've already been birthed you've
[42:53] already had your birth pains you've
[42:55] already been birthed by the by the Word
[42:57] of God it's this earth that when this
[43:01] thing gets birth
[43:03] this thing's gonna get birth because
[43:06] what happened is is Adam fell in this
[43:08] and that fell the ball call her right
[43:14] it's God business where he lays the
[43:16] pattern he cuts her right out now you
[43:17] know why he does that you got to go back
[43:19] to predestination in foreknowledge you
[43:21] got to go to foreknowledge that this
[43:22] part of the that this part of the
[43:24] material went all the way
[43:27] so let's don't forget and it's not
[43:29] predestination like God said all right
[43:31] that's the way it is remember that I
[43:33] said that's what the man said that would
[43:35] be you'd be in a tube and God just pull
[43:36] you through tube no he saw your choice
[43:39] therefore he could put the pattern right
[43:41] where he needed to put it say rhe
[43:43] destination by foreknowledge you can
[43:45] never go wrong you just keep it as
[43:46] predestinate it's my brother Brian would
[43:48] always say he said it's not a good word
[43:49] to use in the crowd why he'd have time
[43:51] to explain that is by foreknowledge but
[43:54] thank God he did pick some sermons that
[43:56] he explained this but
[43:58] really didn't have to Ephesians says
[44:01] foreknowledge of God those who afford
[44:05] new he did predestinate the Bible has
[44:09] always said that it just took a property
[44:10] to bring putting pieces for put it
[44:12] together for us take the pieces and put
[44:14] it together so the rest of this is
[44:18] Calico is just as good as calicoes
[44:20] address but it's God's election God
[44:22] elects his church God predestination
[44:24] Church God for ordained that
[44:28] foreknowledge ordain his church and he
[44:32] takes that church out so what's he doing
[44:34] he's cutting it out he's gonna take the
[44:35] church or the bride he means that the
[44:38] bride and the remnants left to go
[44:41] through the tribulation why they weren't
[44:42] part of the original bride the bride
[44:47] shirt or the bride whatever you want to
[44:49] call it let's say the bride dress but
[44:53] the remnants going to go through the
[44:54] tribulation period to be purged their
[44:58] persecution is going to continue on ours
[45:01] will stop I promise you the Bible it'll
[45:05] stop
[45:06] but there's will continue on into the
[45:09] tribulation period and then when they
[45:10] pass away there's going to stay dead a
[45:12] thousand years so they're purging is
[45:14] going to continue while we're in the
[45:16] Millennium and we're walking on the
[45:18] earth and we're having a good time with
[45:20] 144,000 and the fifth seal Jew and what
[45:23] more they're still going to be dead
[45:24] they're going to be in a dimension
[45:26] somewhere and they're gonna have to wait
[45:27] until the second resurrection they'll
[45:31] come up that white throne I read it to
[45:33] you last Sunday where they will be
[45:34] judged for what their works I don't want
[45:37] to be judged I don't ever want to stand
[45:39] before God with any work that I did yes
[45:42] or no you've got to go start you been in
[45:44] church ever since she's a kid they don't
[45:46] mean one thing to God I don't mean
[45:49] nothing going so I'll take what his work
[45:53] said I'll hide myself behind his word
[45:56] and then if if brother Branham said he
[45:59] said if God had to judge Jesus then he's
[46:02] got to judge me and if there's no
[46:04] judgment in Jesus he took all the
[46:06] judgment then there's none even me
[46:07] so that's read through read is why
[46:11] that's what I'll take I'll take it every
[46:13] time and that's where many Bible
[46:15] scholars get mixed up thinking the bride
[46:16] goes through the tribulation because
[46:18] remember you just keep going through you
[46:20] can see that this this brother here had
[46:23] two bride in heaven the dragon spurt and
[46:26] water to make war with the bride and
[46:28] 144,000 which is the bride stand on
[46:30] mountain now this is another brother
[46:31] talking not brother branham no no no you
[46:34] got it all mixed up the bride was in
[46:35] heaven so see he took us out of the way
[46:37] God takes us out of the way and there's
[46:40] no tribulation for us but the remnant
[46:42] has to go not her not the pattern the
[46:45] remnant was there the persecution the
[46:48] Roman Empire like they said the other
[46:52] day don't worry about don't worry about
[46:55] communism and all the mother is except
[46:57] Romanism Catholicism will consolidate it
[47:00] though you're not there power together
[47:02] with the great church and they're doing
[47:06] it now you see them getting closer and
[47:08] closer and closer and closer
[47:10] alright let's read number five now we
[47:16] find out in this sixth seal now being
[47:18] open it was for a three-fold purpose now
[47:21] here was the purposes the first thing
[47:23] was that the sleeping virgin had to go
[47:25] through the tribulation period for
[47:27] purification we went through that amen
[47:30] they're better out with that the foolish
[47:32] virgin has to go through the tribulation
[47:34] for a purging or a purification she had
[47:40] to be purged of her sins of unbelief and
[47:42] rejecting the message this she was done
[47:46] in the tribulation period we see they
[47:48] wind up over here in Revelation 7
[47:50] between 6 and 7 chapter that she had
[47:52] been purged and she had been given her
[47:54] robes all right now she's not the bride
[47:56] but it's the church the pure people that
[47:59] that didn't have the opportunity maybe
[48:00] to receive the message or in some way
[48:03] that they were blinded by these false
[48:05] prophets we see that happening now and
[48:07] they didn't get their get a chance and
[48:10] yet they're really since they're in
[48:11] heart because remember God knows your
[48:13] heart it's like I said about 144,000
[48:16] it's not gonna be just 144,000 of
[48:17] anybody they just taking choose no it's
[48:20] gonna be the ones that God knows their
[48:21] heart
[48:21] all right
[48:24] yet their sincere heart and God knows
[48:26] their heart and here they're purged
[48:28] during this time so that's the first
[48:29] purging of the of the food's version
[48:31] another purging is what Israel has got
[48:35] to be gathered together that's the
[48:37] second fold God purges Israel in the
[48:39] Tribulation Period out of the millions
[48:42] that are getting there or will gather
[48:43] there there'll be a select 144,000 and
[48:47] they will be purged don't remember they
[48:48] got a dial they'll be persecuted they're
[48:50] going to be persecuted by their own
[48:52] people now there is a whole earth to be
[48:55] purged this is number three there will
[48:57] be such a thing that the moon stars that
[48:59] all nature will be purged you see what
[49:02] it is the earth is renewing herself
[49:03] being purged getting ready for the
[49:07] millennium because remember there were
[49:09] millennium was coming and see
[49:10] everything's got this fields gotta be
[49:12] purged during the sixth seal because
[49:13] remember even your denominational
[49:15] teaching they teach that the Bible says
[49:18] having an earth will pass away so we're
[49:21] just always go to heavens wherever kind
[49:22] of place that is and the Earth's can be
[49:25] destroyed listen to them but they're
[49:28] reading the Bible but thank God it took
[49:30] a prophet to just go right back into
[49:32] dictionary heaven and earth will pass
[49:36] away and pass away he's got that big a
[49:38] you know what ever ever ever ever word
[49:40] and it means just to be changed so
[49:43] heaven and earth will be changed Earth's
[49:46] not gonna be your earth snuggle be
[49:48] destroyed see that's when they go back
[49:49] to the old the old and most people in
[49:52] the message that this body can't be
[49:54] redeemed so God's just gonna get rid of
[49:55] it and bring us a new one up that's
[49:58] really too easy there wouldn't be any
[50:02] persecution in that there wouldn't be
[50:03] any purging in that no God's gonna take
[50:06] that filthy thing you've been walking in
[50:07] all your life and he's gonna change it
[50:09] just like his body was changed when he
[50:12] walked on the earth
[50:13] it wasn't filthy but yet it was in sin
[50:17] in sin in the world of sin Jesus's body
[50:20] wasn't sinful right but still he had to
[50:25] eat he had to do all the things that
[50:26] were human being he had thoughts comes
[50:30] remember his body was made eternal
[50:31] that's where you get your inheritance of
[50:33] an eternal body it's because Jesus's
[50:35] body had to be made eternal
[50:36] remember the ridge of the quote brother
[50:38] Ram said the inheritance he inherited he
[50:41] inherited when he walked out of that
[50:42] tomb he inherited eternal life in his
[50:45] body same way with me and you when we
[50:47] take a body change you will inherit
[50:49] eternal life in your body it's already
[50:55] been done the firstfruits is already up
[51:02] so now the field can do just like the
[51:05] first fruit that's what that first fruit
[51:07] was remember the first fruit was as you
[51:10] went looked at the in the field and the
[51:12] one that was the month that matured
[51:13] first had his head stuck up a little bit
[51:16] higher maybe the apples were bigger or
[51:18] what more you want to say the priest
[51:20] would go out and what he would do he
[51:21] would cut that out bring it back and
[51:24] wave it over the field not just that
[51:27] this is the only thing it's an example
[51:32] that the rest of the field is going to
[51:34] come to maturity and they're going to
[51:36] harvest it just like they did that wave
[51:39] when Christ was on Calvary he was the
[51:43] priest he was the first fruit he was the
[51:46] first one up out of the ground that took
[51:49] a glorified body I don't care what
[51:50] anybody else says he's the only one
[51:52] that's reach to immortality the Bible
[51:54] says and immortality means you were once
[51:56] immortal and now you're immortal
[51:58] there's only one person done that you
[52:00] say what about inna I'm not worried
[52:01] about that Jesus is one I'm worried
[52:03] about if he can do it I can do it
[52:06] because he said he was gonna do it
[52:08] through me and you so this being the
[52:13] change seal let's look at this just for
[52:14] a minute I wrote these notes and then
[52:15] we'll get back to her to our quotes if
[52:19] this is the steel that changes
[52:20] everything remember the flood changed
[52:23] the world 4000 years ago didn't destroy
[52:29] it but what happened as soon as Noah
[52:32] come out of the ark started standing
[52:35] again right so I just started to cycle
[52:39] all over again Jesus come on earth he
[52:42] came through it wound that nothing never
[52:44] happened like that before
[52:46] never know a man know never know a man
[52:49] that's that
[52:50] before well when he stepped on the world
[52:53] into the world look what happened there
[52:56] was a change that begun he said I am the
[53:02] way the truth and the life
[53:04] I'm the door come by me I'm the one I'm
[53:07] the one not me but Christ to say he kept
[53:11] trying to tell him who he was
[53:14] I'm the light of the world I've come to
[53:18] give this place a change but what did
[53:21] they do in that Joseph boy don't even
[53:26] make benches and baseball bats and some
[53:30] kind of carpenter what is he he's but it
[53:33] hit me works with his old daddy's
[53:34] daddy's old you know they you see what I
[53:37] mean because it was it was common to
[53:39] them like a lot of people's gonna say
[53:40] he's coming to us well how in the world
[53:42] can you don't worry about how in the
[53:44] world can you your change is gonna come
[53:48] from right here inside so Jesus changed
[53:53] the world total disruption of nature
[53:56] because nature says every seed has to
[53:58] bring forth of its kind and it takes a
[54:00] male and a female see where I'm going
[54:03] with this
[54:03] take some male and a female Christ comes
[54:07] and it doesn't take a male and a female
[54:11] like we say male and female that changed
[54:14] the world saying that you can be born
[54:20] the right way not to mom and daddy but
[54:25] that you can be born again and you can
[54:28] come the same way he came so he changed
[54:33] the world on the day of Pentecost Wow
[54:38] that came from having the sound of a
[54:41] rushing it wasn't just a ain't the way
[54:47] God broke into this dimension I believe
[54:50] it world that whole building now you
[54:52] know if it don't matter if they could
[54:54] hear it outside they knew what was going
[54:55] on inside it changed the world because
[54:58] now there was a hundred and twenty
[54:59] people that were born in sin that were
[55:02] born by momma and daddy
[55:04] we're now standing in an upper room
[55:05] shouting and praising God and starting a
[55:08] new world order we always talk about all
[55:13] over the world they got this new bush
[55:15] he's got this new world know that that
[55:17] Pentecost started a new world order all
[55:21] it didn't change the world back up and
[55:23] it didn't just do away with the devil
[55:24] but it started a process there was a
[55:28] nature change a hundred and twenty
[55:30] natures were killed and the nature of
[55:35] God was put in that it never happened
[55:39] never happened didn't happen Jesus was
[55:44] he wasn't born like they were this is
[55:46] people that were born from sex of mom
[55:49] and dad either wrong or you know you
[55:51] won't something not the right way it was
[55:54] the right way to come that way now but
[55:56] it wasn't guards provided first way it
[55:59] was supposed to be spoken word so that's
[56:01] exactly what happened on the day of
[56:02] Pentecost they came with them from
[56:03] rushing mighty wind and God birthed 120
[56:06] children into the body of Christ never
[56:09] touched them with male instrumentality
[56:13] understand what I'm saying he touched
[56:14] him with the Word of God and that
[56:16] started a new world order that started
[56:19] what 2,000 years of a difference 2,000
[56:24] years of a church of church ages of
[56:27] seven church ages it brought you and I
[56:30] to a place because that had to change
[56:33] the world so that the son of man listen
[56:36] to what I'm saying so the son of man
[56:37] could come back in the end time ain't
[56:40] not just changed the soul but change
[56:43] your body had to happen that way
[56:47] and there's a new world order that begun
[56:50] when the Prophet came on the scene and
[56:53] it thundered and the thunder was not
[56:56] that William Branham was God he was the
[57:00] Prophet but he said I'm bringing Christ
[57:03] to you and Christ will change your body
[57:10] a new world order forget about that
[57:13] world out there it's alright and then
[57:23] there's two hundred thousand thousand
[57:25] demons they reside pretty close to me I
[57:29] don't know about you but they're put
[57:33] there to change you because you're not
[57:38] gonna change yourself everybody do this
[57:42] they're not you're not going to change
[57:45] by yourself that's why God has a
[57:47] provided way to do this he gave us the
[57:52] total he gave us the whole prescription
[57:54] and then he released two hundred
[57:56] thousand thousand demons on Israel to
[57:59] drive them back to the homeland now he
[58:03] took them same two hundred thousand
[58:04] thousand demons and he put him on the
[58:06] bride he let him go on us to do what
[58:11] brother Brown said drive us back to the
[58:12] word our homeland will see my homeland
[58:15] is not just the Word of God my homeland
[58:17] is that the Word of God is going to
[58:19] change this thing right here because
[58:22] that's what the word said it would do we
[58:24] which are alive and remain to the coming
[58:26] of Lord shall not prevent those which
[58:28] are asleep where we shall all be changed
[58:33] but you change started today God killed
[58:36] that old nature he started a new world
[58:38] order because I'm gonna tell you
[58:40] something if will realize that we'll
[58:45] realize that we're way further than we
[58:47] think we are when we notice that that
[58:50] new world order listen did it not change
[58:53] your world when you got born again
[58:55] please people good grief you go like I
[58:58] said before Louise don't mind me you go
[59:00] to me in him the same way I didn't have
[59:01] a problem going to the beer store grab
[59:04] into Miller Lite Bud Light and putting
[59:08] it on the on my cart I had no
[59:10] reservation why because my old nature
[59:13] was taking over right
[59:15] my old nature was prevalent it was right
[59:18] there and it didn't bother me one bit to
[59:19] roll up there you know put it in take my
[59:21] good hard-earned cash out and
[59:23] and pay for that thing you know cuz I'd
[59:26] going home and I really didn't ever do
[59:29] that Jim can tell you I never did stuff
[59:30] she's going what do you do why I mean I
[59:32] did a lot of other things you didn't in
[59:34] the same way there was no reservation
[59:35] why because that old nature just
[59:37] continued it just kept pushing you but
[59:40] now with a new nature it changed my
[59:42] whole world I don't have the things in
[59:45] my house I used to have do you and you
[59:50] know whatever list it wherever you want
[59:51] to list it I don't have them girlie
[59:55] magazines I don't have to this I don't
[59:57] have that you point every you got on
[59:58] there you make a list why cuz I had a
[1:00:00] nature change it disrupted in my world
[1:00:04] thank God
[1:00:07] only God can change your nature to the
[1:00:10] right way that's why if we can save our
[1:00:13] kids we would but you can't because the
[1:00:17] one nature can't change another nature
[1:00:19] God's got to change your nature
[1:00:22] so those 200,000 out thousand demons
[1:00:25] were released on us to drive us to our
[1:00:31] homeland and my homeland like I said
[1:00:34] it's not just I'm not satisfied listen
[1:00:36] the words been here forever and ever and
[1:00:38] is forever gonna be here but there's
[1:00:40] never been a group of people take a body
[1:00:44] change this not died first a group I
[1:00:49] said if you want to waste everybody's
[1:00:50] going what about Enoch can I be blunt I
[1:00:54] don't care cuz I can't explain it if
[1:00:58] brother Brennan would have explained it
[1:00:59] if the Bible would have explained it
[1:01:01] no Enoch took the translation so Enoch
[1:01:04] is somewhere else but he's not bride I'm
[1:01:08] worried about bride whatever changed his
[1:01:11] nature or whatever that's fine with me
[1:01:13] that has nothing to do with us it's an
[1:01:17] example sure but don't try to figure it
[1:01:21] out you know what brother Brad never
[1:01:24] really answered it he said I don't know
[1:01:27] you know why because it didn't matter
[1:01:30] you and I are going to be the only
[1:01:34] people ever
[1:01:38] Adam to be born by momma and daddy
[1:01:41] raised up by the devil that Dad will be
[1:01:48] pour out of your house God walked in
[1:01:52] your house and now he's gonna walk in
[1:01:55] this that's never happened before
[1:01:59] even with Jesus cuz he was not born of
[1:02:02] sex you and I this is the nastiest of
[1:02:06] nasty this is nasty
[1:02:10] but God's gonna take out of that nasty
[1:02:12] same way with this world look at this
[1:02:14] world man look at all the things that
[1:02:16] could you imagine we look at things and
[1:02:18] we look at things on the surface but can
[1:02:21] you imagine all you think well the
[1:02:22] earthquake is going to be bad in
[1:02:23] California but I read them an article
[1:02:26] somebody wrote about what if that
[1:02:29] happened in California what would happen
[1:02:31] afterwards you talk about you know 30
[1:02:36] million people dying instantly because
[1:02:37] they're drowned no that ain't gonna
[1:02:39] there's gonna be another 20 million I
[1:02:41] think or 10 or 20 million people that's
[1:02:44] gonna die of horrible diseases because
[1:02:48] all your gaps lines are gonna break all
[1:02:50] your sewer lines are gonna break there's
[1:02:52] gonna be no water you understand so the
[1:02:54] peripheral is what's gonna kill more
[1:02:56] than than that but see that nasty I
[1:02:58] don't that's nasty
[1:03:01] but that's what I was I was that nasty
[1:03:04] but God took me out of it God reached
[1:03:07] down and plucked me out of this world oh
[1:03:09] yeah we live in this world but God
[1:03:11] plucked me out of this world he plucked
[1:03:13] you out of this world give me my hand
[1:03:16] clapping pray thank God
[1:03:20] and now listen nature now will literally
[1:03:24] explode when our body changes literally
[1:03:27] this earth cannot handle God walking Oh
[1:03:31] two feet in a bribe that was so nasty
[1:03:35] Satan hates that worse than anything for
[1:03:39] this whole world it's gonna explode
[1:03:42] because of you cause God exploded this
[1:03:45] world first hey man so persecution
[1:03:50] that's okay I may not like it when he
[1:03:56] comes but bring it on because the
[1:04:03] products always come better under
[1:04:04] persecution let's reach second Timothy 3
[1:04:06] verse 10 but thou has fully known my
[1:04:13] doctrine manner of life this is Paul
[1:04:15] purpose faith long-suffering charity
[1:04:18] patience persecutions afflictions what
[1:04:23] about a man that walks up and preaches
[1:04:24] to a group of people four or five times
[1:04:27] and they hate him so much they put him
[1:04:29] on the spot and they beat him 39 stripes
[1:04:31] save one because they say 48 lashes is
[1:04:35] want to kill you he carried those with
[1:04:37] him and he continued to preach he didn't
[1:04:40] just says Jeannie he didn't say I think
[1:04:42] I'm gonna get to get me a ticket and go
[1:04:43] to another for oh no he stayed
[1:04:45] right there why he had a purpose
[1:04:49] persecution affliction which came upon
[1:04:51] me unto me at Antioch at Iconium at
[1:04:54] Lystra what persecutions I endured but
[1:04:57] out of them all the Lord delivered me
[1:04:59] yea and all that will live godly in
[1:05:02] Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution
[1:05:06] Matthew 13 verse 20 but he that received
[1:05:09] the seed into stony places the same is
[1:05:12] he that heareth the word now remember
[1:05:13] this is the story parable or the seed
[1:05:17] and watch what happens if you're not
[1:05:19] rooted and grounded but he that received
[1:05:21] the seed in the stormy places the same
[1:05:23] is he that heareth the word and anon
[1:05:26] with joy receiveth how many times have
[1:05:27] you done that brother Dale has always
[1:05:28] told us you know you you see people come
[1:05:30] in this that you know right on the front
[1:05:32] row and they're all you
[1:05:33] can't contain them and six months later
[1:05:35] they're gone I always think of this
[1:05:39] scripture right here with joy they heard
[1:05:42] it but he that received the seed and cuz
[1:05:45] it was seed they received a message it
[1:05:49] just didn't go deep enough because watch
[1:05:51] in dystonia places the same is he that
[1:05:54] heareth the word and anon with joy and
[1:05:56] other words brought brought it on heaped
[1:05:58] it on with joy received it yet hath he
[1:06:01] not root in himself but he endure it for
[1:06:05] awhile for when tribulation or
[1:06:08] persecution arises because of the word
[1:06:12] not because somebody don't like what you
[1:06:14] drive or don't like what you eat it's
[1:06:17] the word because of the word by and by
[1:06:21] he is offended in other words they leave
[1:06:23] Wow
[1:06:25] Deuteronomy 431 says when thou art in
[1:06:28] tribulation and all these things are
[1:06:31] come upon thee even in the latter days
[1:06:33] now this is this is God talking to
[1:06:35] Israel but he also jumped up he said
[1:06:38] even in the latter days if thou turn to
[1:06:42] the Lord thy God he shall be Oh beating
[1:06:44] into his voice but the Lord God God is a
[1:06:46] merciful God he will not forsake thee
[1:06:49] neither destroy thee nor forget the
[1:06:52] Covenant of thy father's which he sware
[1:06:54] unto them he's not gonna forget Israel I
[1:06:57] told you he's not how can God told us
[1:07:01] that how can a woman that's had a baby
[1:07:02] forget the baby so how can I forget
[1:07:05] Israel God said he's not gonna forget it
[1:07:07] as I'm sure he's gonna let him go
[1:07:08] through some persecution because of what
[1:07:09] they did he's going to let us go through
[1:07:11] persecution for the things we do but he
[1:07:16] will not forsake you or destroy you
[1:07:21] Matthew 24 verse 22 for then shall be
[1:07:26] Great Tribulation such as we're not
[1:07:28] since the beginning of the world to this
[1:07:29] time no nor even shall be and except
[1:07:33] those days should be shortened there
[1:07:34] should be no flesh saved but for the
[1:07:38] elects sake those days shall be
[1:07:41] shortened then if any man shall say unto
[1:07:44] you lo here is Christ or there believe
[1:07:45] it not
[1:07:47] I preached on this a long time ago cuz
[1:07:49] that's what God's that what that's what
[1:07:51] the devil's gonna do he's gonna say hey
[1:07:52] I can do this I can do the signs and
[1:07:55] wonders right follow me no you know why
[1:08:03] he you know why you won't get caught up
[1:08:05] in that
[1:08:06] cuz Christ is in you and once you
[1:08:11] realize he's in you all that other goes
[1:08:14] away but if you don't realize he's in
[1:08:17] you you will get caught up with that
[1:08:19] don't don't think maybe I won't know
[1:08:22] brother branham said he said mark of the
[1:08:24] beast or the mark of God one of the two
[1:08:27] there's not an in-between if you're not
[1:08:28] born again you will take the mark of the
[1:08:31] beast that's why the foolish virgin has
[1:08:33] to go through persecution because they
[1:08:35] accept that what's that
[1:08:39] excuse me except those days should be
[1:08:41] shortened there should be no flesh stay
[1:08:43] but for the elects sake those days shall
[1:08:45] be shortened thank God then if any man
[1:08:48] shall say unto you lo here is Christ or
[1:08:49] there believe it not for their share
[1:08:52] arise false Christ's and false prophets
[1:08:53] and shall show great signs and wonders
[1:08:58] hmm and so much that if it were possible
[1:09:03] they shall deceive the very elect
[1:09:05] brother Brent said but the Elector
[1:09:12] wherefore if they shall say unto you
[1:09:14] behold his in the desert go not forth
[1:09:18] why do I not why do I need to go in the
[1:09:19] desert he's right here
[1:09:22] oh he's out there at that other place no
[1:09:28] he's right here if you know he's right

[1:09:31] other place amen behold he's in the
[1:09:34] desert go not for behold he's in the
[1:09:36] secret chamber believe it not for his

[1:09:54] and down here and over here and over
[1:09:55] this way
[1:09:55] the same way with the Son of Man but you
[1:09:57] and I don't know cuz you and I will be
[1:10:00] that
[1:10:03] I have no problem knowing where the son
[1:10:06] of man is he's the word made flesh in

[1:10:20] gathered together amen
[1:10:22] so where the carcass is where the word
[1:10:25] is there will the eagle's be gathered
[1:10:28] together so don't worry about anything
[1:10:30] little bride God's gonna take care of it
[1:10:32] all number six and I'm sorry really to
[1:10:35] have held you like this or mine but to
[1:10:39] just get a tape of this now the Lord
[1:10:40] willing this is what I'm speaking out of
[1:10:42] Phoenix Sunday afternoon then Monday I'm
[1:10:44] going a little short meat and so forth
[1:10:45] purposed in my heart this year for a
[1:10:47] little willing I'd cut and tore from
[1:10:48] side to side
[1:10:49] he has problems too and we all know
[1:10:51] that's the identification we know what
[1:10:54] the third pull is now this is Shalom
[1:10:58] 1964 and what's what he said everybody's
[1:11:02] want to know what the third pull is we
[1:11:03] know what the third pull is we know what
[1:11:05] it is is he opening the word it's not a
[1:11:07] great day Saturday she opening a word
[1:11:10] here's what he just said is he opening
[1:11:14] the word why and I think now this is
[1:11:18] your prophet saying this not me
[1:11:20] now you got you'll have the tape so
[1:11:23] everybody listening to tape they'll hear
[1:11:24] this and I think that it'll just lay
[1:11:27] dormant for a little while what the
[1:11:29] third Pole until the great hour of
[1:11:32] persecution comes on that's when it be
[1:11:36] it'll speak it'll be manifested just
[1:11:41] like the five straight signs without
[1:11:42] failure perfectly that's what you
[1:11:46] promised it it's laying dormant now
[1:11:50] that's what he just said read it again
[1:11:52] and I think it'll just lay dormant for a
[1:11:55] little while until the great hour of
[1:11:58] persecution comes on we have not had
[1:11:59] that great hour persecution yet but when
[1:12:02] we do what happened under the third pole
[1:12:04] of his ministry there were things spoken
[1:12:06] into existence there was a nature of two
[1:12:10] boys changed a man there was a nature
[1:12:15] boys changed under that third poll a man
[1:12:18] stood and changed nature on the mountain
[1:12:23] big storm coming in feats of snuff feet
[1:12:25] of snow coming in all these different
[1:12:27] things speaks it away
[1:12:30] that's an interruption of nature yeah
[1:12:33] hey man then you got squirrels that come
[1:12:36] from nowhere and there were the
[1:12:38] squirrels he's saying it's laying
[1:12:41] dormant you know why cuz it wasn't for
[1:12:43] them it's for you and me it's for me and
[1:12:49] you that third Pole ministry is not for
[1:12:51] brother branham it was for me and you he
[1:12:53] used it showed us it could be done but
[1:12:56] I'm reading read that one more time I
[1:12:57] think it'll just lay dormant for a
[1:12:59] little while until the great our
[1:13:01] persecution comes on now has the great
[1:13:03] our persecution come no why do you need
[1:13:06] to speak your cabinet full of food when
[1:13:13] Boyd needs to probably take a lot of his
[1:13:15] out no no not sit there and eat it all
[1:13:21] give it away but not really listen to be
[1:13:25] silly go open your cabinet you don't
[1:13:31] need it you don't need food like Rodell
[1:13:35] always said why wouldn't pray for rain
[1:13:36] and we've got ten inches of rain and
[1:13:39] we've got Friday and Saturday is fixing
[1:13:41] the sprain again why don't we pray for
[1:13:43] right we don't need to pray for rain we
[1:13:47] don't need to pray for food we need we
[1:13:49] need to pray to God to get us in
[1:13:50] position get us in position that when
[1:13:53] that hour does come that we can speed
[1:13:56] not call brother down say brother now I
[1:13:58] need some pork chops he know he may not
[1:14:01] know you need a pork job but God knows
[1:14:04] you need a pork chop so there they come
[1:14:07] there's whatever you need now it's not
[1:14:09] going to be a hole he's not gonna fill
[1:14:11] your freezer he's gonna he's gonna give
[1:14:13] you what you need not your wants he's
[1:14:16] gonna give you your needs but I believe
[1:14:18] we're coming to that our that's what
[1:14:19] we're I'm looking forward to I'm looking
[1:14:20] to that place to where that God can
[1:14:23] speak through you and things will happen
[1:14:27] we've all
[1:14:28] seen parts of that we've already seen
[1:14:31] things materialized because of of the
[1:14:35] speech of the word man let's go to
[1:14:40] number seven real quick the ninety ones
[1:14:42] at the end time noticed the very day
[1:14:45] when this messenger now look not when he
[1:14:48] starts on but when he begins to declare
[1:14:51] his message now once brother I'm talking
[1:14:52] about yeah I have many many clothes that
[1:14:56] brother Brown says not in the years of
[1:14:57] preparation not in the healing campaigns
[1:14:59] in other words not from the 47 to 63 was
[1:15:02] building up we don't listen what you
[1:15:04] know as well as I do in this church
[1:15:06] there's a lot of people that say well
[1:15:07] brother man was wrong so we don't listen
[1:15:09] for 63 if you don't you won't have a
[1:15:11] clue what he's saying unless you read 47
[1:15:15] to 63 you you're lost if you think that
[1:15:20] you know why you've lost the word he
[1:15:24] preached the word from 47 till the day
[1:15:27] passed he preached the Word of God I
[1:15:30] depend on that but not when he starts on
[1:15:34] but when he begins to declare remember
[1:15:36] his message the declaration of his
[1:15:38] message was in these seals that's what
[1:15:41] he was commissioned to bring was the
[1:15:44] opening of the seals see first pull
[1:15:49] healing second pull prophesy he didn't
[1:15:54] just take him by the hand any more he
[1:15:56] told him the secrets in their heart he
[1:15:59] didn't tell him God told him but he
[1:16:02] yielded itself so much to God that it
[1:16:06] that the gift worked the way it was
[1:16:08] supposed to all right but now third Pole
[1:16:10] the opening of the word the mysteries
[1:16:13] revealed no more there is no more higher
[1:16:18] order to reveal the word than prophets
[1:16:20] but the only way the Prophet can be
[1:16:23] vindicated is by the word and remember
[1:16:27] the third pole was the opening of them
[1:16:29] seven seals to reveal the hidden truth
[1:16:33] that's been sealed in the world in the
[1:16:36] word do you see it the congregation says
[1:16:37] they're men I'm reading what he said
[1:16:42] the third pool is the opening of the
[1:16:43] seals yeah so are the seals open seals
[1:16:49] were open and they may not be to you and
[1:16:51] you can sit there ignorantly and say
[1:16:53] that they're not open but they're not
[1:16:54] open to you because they're open to me
[1:16:56] this is an open we preach out of an open
[1:16:58] book amen so the third pole is skin' in
[1:17:03] that opening of the seven seals the
[1:17:06] voice of God the Thunder the opening of
[1:17:09] the word has never been seen before when
[1:17:11] brother Brown whipped that when he
[1:17:13] whipped that top off of that pyramid he
[1:17:16] said light had never it wasn't that the
[1:17:18] word wasn't there the words always been
[1:17:22] in the Bible but nobody had looked there
[1:17:25] was not light had shone on that what was
[1:17:27] in that pyramid but when he whipped that
[1:17:30] top off I believe that's when the seals
[1:17:32] were open because there was a lid on it
[1:17:34] and he popped that lid off and he told
[1:17:37] us what God had said in the love letter
[1:17:41] that God had already wrote it's already
[1:17:43] been there it was just a love letter
[1:17:45] there between the lines that me and you
[1:17:47] guys amen so there it is the third pole
[1:17:51] was the opening of those seven seals so
[1:17:54] what's gonna take what's gonna change
[1:17:56] our body the third pole the opening of
[1:17:58] the seal that's what's gonna change our
[1:17:59] body if not then there's brother Dale's
[1:18:02] always said and I agree 100%
[1:18:04] then there's somewhere that somebody
[1:18:06] you're gonna have to die cuz you can't
[1:18:08] take all the word sorry or either that
[1:18:13] or god forbid you're not born again but
[1:18:16] one of the two you're not gonna take a
[1:18:17] body change and be a baby standing on
[1:18:20] earth now you may have to die the death
[1:18:22] and go by the grave and you may have to
[1:18:24] come up so what let's go back to that
[1:18:28] point I ain't got to worry about taxes
[1:18:30] anger worry about phone bill car payment
[1:18:32] well I'll have a car payment anyway
[1:18:34] house payment all the other stuff but
[1:18:37] the third pole was the opening of the
[1:18:38] seven seals to reveal the hidden truth
[1:18:40] that's been sealed in the word that's
[1:18:43] pretty plain
[1:18:45] so now let's read this real quick I want
[1:18:47] to read a few of these and we'll be done
[1:18:50] number one that's in the back of you
[1:18:52] it's one of these that brother Joe so
[1:18:55] graciously
[1:18:56] all these together and these are just
[1:18:57] four of them he gave me a whole bunch
[1:18:59] but I just picked out these now look
[1:19:01] notice from the kings of the earth have
[1:19:02] committed fornication and the habitants
[1:19:04] of the earth have been made drunk with
[1:19:05] the wine of her fornication her wine is
[1:19:08] what she was giving out her stimulation
[1:19:10] we are the church we're the one that's
[1:19:12] got it see now just draw that in your
[1:19:14] mind now alright see carried like the
[1:19:16] angel told John I'll show you this
[1:19:18] judgment that's coming to this great
[1:19:19] church now watch so he carried me away
[1:19:21] in the spirit in the wilderness and I
[1:19:22] saw a woman sitting on a scarlet colored
[1:19:24] colored beast scarlet in the Bible
[1:19:27] represents royal the color scarlet means
[1:19:29] red the Beast represents power did you
[1:19:31] notice the beasts come up out of the sea
[1:19:33] that was in Revelations 13 now that goes
[1:19:35] back to United States right revelations
[1:19:39] 13 is America because with 13 stripes 13
[1:19:42] colonies and when you see the beasts
[1:19:44] come up out at sea it meant that this
[1:19:46] power was raising up among the people
[1:19:48] but in Revelations 13 when this lamb
[1:19:50] come up he come up out of the earth
[1:19:52] no people United States but then after
[1:19:56] he had two little horns silver civil and
[1:19:58] ecclesiastical power and then he
[1:20:01] received power and spoke like the dragon
[1:20:03] did before him so you just got to mark
[1:20:05] it down we are coming into a religious
[1:20:08] now listen folks we ain't gotta wait the
[1:20:12] religious persecution is happening right

[1:20:32] words you know I read you one in just a
[1:20:37] minute I hope I still got it I it's back

[1:21:33] it's happened in now because look at
[1:21:34] them they cut you off because of the
[1:21:36] things you preach are the things you
[1:21:38] don't preach
[1:21:39] there's always religion being religious
[1:21:41] persecution with the same thing we are
[1:21:44] coming into a religious persecution with
[1:21:45] the same thing that they did in pagan
[1:21:47] Rome many years ago for it's dusts at
[1:21:49] the Lord now what is it sitting upon a
[1:21:52] beast a power number two spoken words
[1:21:55] original seed now what they're trying to
[1:21:57] do they're trying to manufacture a
[1:21:58] ladder rain nonsense why the latter rain
[1:22:02] will sweep the world brother been a
[1:22:04] former rain sowing words brother branham
[1:22:06] sowed the former rain now we'll see that
[1:22:09] the latter what the latter rain produces
[1:22:11] I'm looking at it I'm looking at that
[1:22:15] being made real right now
[1:22:18] that's right now you'll see what the
[1:22:21] latter rain produces you'll find out
[1:22:23] there'll be an affliction the
[1:22:25] Pentecostals and all the groups will
[1:22:28] come together and they'll shut the doors
[1:22:30] on them guys that won't listen to it
[1:22:32] they won't even be allowed to open your
[1:22:35] mouth you won't even be allowed only
[1:22:37] mother right that's when he'll come who
[1:22:41] he Christ that's when he cries that's
[1:22:43] when that third Pole you see that third
[1:22:44] Pole lays dormant but now it's coming
[1:22:46] into being that's how he'll show that's
[1:22:49] when you'll see a rain
[1:22:51] oh my lay still be quiet
[1:22:54] uh-huh let it go just become as you can
[1:22:57] be because you can't manufactory
[1:23:01] number three spoken words regional city
[1:23:03] paragraph four forty three remember
[1:23:07] there'll be such a denominational
[1:23:09] gathering pretty soon it'll be terrific
[1:23:11] and they will bring themselves together
[1:23:13] into this Federation of churches and
[1:23:15] when this kind of church will be then
[1:23:17] this kind of church will be put out of
[1:23:19] operation as far as they know
[1:23:23] Thank You brother branham I appreciate
[1:23:24] you putting that in there as far as they
[1:23:26] know it's at that time that Jesus will
[1:23:32] appear and he will show which his bride
[1:23:36] this is it right here and he will show
[1:23:38] which his bride and which is not
[1:23:41] remember brother Brown said there was
[1:23:43] all kind of showdowns but there's one
[1:23:46] coming here a Mount Transfiguration
[1:23:48] showdown because you're gonna come to
[1:23:50] that Mount Transfiguration and you're
[1:23:52] either going to be transfigured or
[1:23:54] you're lost all right and he will show
[1:23:59] which is bright and which is not and
[1:24:00] remember Christian friends I'm a man I
[1:24:02] can make mistakes but God being God
[1:24:04] cannot make a mistake all the words has
[1:24:08] been written must be fulfilled jesus
[1:24:10] said so so we got things here in the
[1:24:12] scripture that must be fulfilled and
[1:24:14] that's one of these things this boycott
[1:24:15] to come but before this boycott can come
[1:24:19] of the marking of the beast there has to
[1:24:21] be a seed sowed
[1:24:25] that's right now packing it in sowing
[1:24:30] the seed for God to take a church out of
[1:24:33] it you understand now congregation says
[1:24:35] amen a seed has to be sowed a
[1:24:38] denominational seed and they're to make
[1:24:40] a form or an image to the beast of
[1:24:42] Church of Rome there has to be a true
[1:24:44] bride and we understand that the
[1:24:46] so-called bride is rejected everybody
[1:24:49] all right with that say Amen all right
[1:24:51] now number four last thing started
[1:24:52] easing church age musicians you can get
[1:24:55] ready to come home you know we're living
[1:24:57] in the end time it's in this age that
[1:25:00] the churches are going to come together
[1:25:02] and as there are even now controlling
[1:25:04] world politics they will soon control
[1:25:07] the finances of the world we see that
[1:25:09] happening now all right and then if you
[1:25:12] don't belong to the world organization
[1:25:14] of churches you won't be able to buy
[1:25:15] ourselves you will lose all these who
[1:25:19] stay true to God and keep their garments
[1:25:21] clean from the defilement of this world
[1:25:23] system of church orders will be
[1:25:25] physically bereft
[1:25:26] now that word breath means is you're
[1:25:28] gonna do without something that you
[1:25:29] previously had all right there will be
[1:25:32] presented to them a great temptation to
[1:25:36] give in
[1:25:37] preachers will give in it's got to be
[1:25:40] false it's got to be the fault Shepard
[1:25:43] just got true bride can't do that
[1:25:45] preachers will give in with the excuse
[1:25:48] that they will serve God within the
[1:25:50] framework of the Antichrist system
[1:25:53] please they will give in to the
[1:25:55] flatteries and blandishments of the
[1:25:57] hierarchy and the people will follow
[1:26:00] these false shepherds right into the
[1:26:03] slaughter but in the judgment they will
[1:26:06] all be found naked they will not be
[1:26:08] given those white robes neither will
[1:26:10] they walk with him you can't walk in the
[1:26:12] spotted garments of the world holding
[1:26:15] hands with the devil here and then
[1:26:17] expect to be with God it's time to wake
[1:26:20] up
[1:26:21] spoke a word church and hear the voice
[1:26:23] of God crying come out of her my people
[1:26:26] that she be not partakers of her sins
[1:26:29] that you received in her plagues amen
[1:26:31] God is speaking shun the religions of
[1:26:34] the world like you shun the plague
[1:26:36] leave off walking with the world and
[1:26:38] make your garments white by repentance
[1:26:40] than the blood of the Lamb but do it now
[1:26:43] for tomorrow may be too late let's stand
[1:26:46] to our feet all that live godly in
[1:26:56] christ shall suffer persecution
