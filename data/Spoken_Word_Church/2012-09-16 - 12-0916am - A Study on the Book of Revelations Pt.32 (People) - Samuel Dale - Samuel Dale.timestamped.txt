[6:51] 1 now the Lord willing and said the Lord
[6:54] willing next Sunday we're going to
[6:57] be we're going to take the uh way that
[7:01] kind of like we've done the Daniel 70
[7:02] weeks uh up at the uh ministers meeting
[7:07] and it is on the internet if you want to
[7:10] download it you can see the the
[7:12] presentation that we made there and has
[7:15] been requested we do it here so we're
[7:17] going to try to to do that so the Lord
[7:19] willing next Sunday uh I'll take the
[7:21] morning service and kind of present the
[7:23] part and then Wade can take the evening
[7:25] service to to be able to present his
[7:28] part that way we can approach it a
[7:30] little different by having a different
[7:32] amount of time we were kind of limited
[7:35] there but it worked out real good I
[7:36] thought and so just remember that amen
[7:40] Revelations
[7:43] 1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which
[7:46] God gave unto him to show unto his
[7:47] servants things which must shortly come
[7:50] to pass and he said and signified it by
[7:52] his Angel and to his servant John who by
[7:55] a record of the word of God and the
[7:57] testim of the testimony of Jesus Christ
[7:59] Christ and of all things that he saw
[8:02] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[8:04] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[8:06] those things which are written therein
[8:08] amen for the time is at hand what is it
[8:12] time to understand is at hand let's go
[8:15] over to chapter
[8:19] 6 all right we read 1 through one and
[8:23] two from the last Parts we've been on
[8:25] and now let's go to verse three and when
[8:28] he had opened the second seal I heard
[8:31] the second beast say come and see and
[8:34] there went out another power that was
[8:36] red and power went out another horse
[8:39] that was red and power was given unto
[8:41] him that set there on to take peace from
[8:43] the earth and that they should kill one
[8:45] another and there was given unto him a
[8:48] great sword you may be seated the Lord
[8:51] at his Blessing to the reading of the
[8:56] word now we've been doing this in the
[8:58] series and we came up through uh chapter
[9:02] 5 and saw that it was actually the
[9:05] opening of the seals and things but that
[9:08] is to showing that what would go to
[9:11] Israel because we believe that you know
[9:15] the seals is to Israel amen the
[9:17] Revelation is to the bride right you say
[9:20] yeah but brother Dale we we get the
[9:21] seals well you better be careful talking
[9:25] about getting the seals because the
[9:27] first seal is the man of sin sitting in
[9:29] the temple of God showing himself to be
[9:31] as God right so I wouldn't want to be
[9:33] there when it happens because that's
[9:35] when he's incarnate will get back in the
[9:37] minute in the form of the Beast amen
[9:39] well see then that would put you in bad
[9:41] shape right I certainly wouldn't want to
[9:43] be there with the uh killings of
[9:46] Armageddon the different things and I
[9:49] certainly wouldn't want to be there on
[9:50] the six seal and then we totally be left
[9:53] out in the fifth that that be in the
[9:55] souls Under The Altar and I certainly
[9:58] don't want to be uh left out of this do
[10:00] you amen so then I know that's a a way
[10:04] of people thinking because it's always
[10:05] just been that way uh that people just
[10:08] say uh the seals we understand the seals
[10:12] uh that's the white horse rider well now
[10:16] uh that would be revealing Satan yeah
[10:20] and the Bible is not revealing
[10:23] Satan it is revealing Jesus
[10:26] Christ we just read here in Genesis I
[10:29] mean in Revelations one one it's the
[10:32] revelation of Jesus Christ right we've
[10:35] been over this over this and over with
[10:36] it for you for 40 years trying to get
[10:39] you to
[10:41] understand because see there's no such
[10:43] thing as a revelation of the
[10:46] devil that's right there's a revelation
[10:49] of Jesus Christ he would have to be
[10:51] something to be revealed right right
[10:54] right and he's not anything he he's a
[10:57] demon power he's a he's a Spirit he's
[11:00] all the things but see the Bible is
[11:02] revealing Jesus Christ and I know people
[11:04] will get that and they say boy you
[11:06] really are messed up because we see
[11:09] that's what it we believe we
[11:12] who what gives you any right to believe
[11:14] anything other than what God
[11:16] says that's right you say well who gives
[11:19] you the right I don't have none I just
[11:21] forfeited mine and have tried my best to
[11:23] be able to yield to him to make him
[11:25] speak through me through all of these
[11:27] years and I haven't changed in 40 years
[11:30] so I don't think you'll need to worry
[11:31] about changing anymore you know we just
[11:33] forget it done too old to change you
[11:36] know I'm not trying to run for president
[11:38] so I don't have to worry about a
[11:42] change that's what got him in our
[11:44] lifesty I don't know what's going to get
[11:47] who in this time but we ain't worried
[11:49] about it because it's like I told him
[11:51] one time in fellowship meeting I said
[11:54] you want me to tell you who's going to
[11:55] be president and they said they were
[11:57] just looking you know I said we you want
[11:58] me to even give you thus sayith the Lord
[12:00] everybody just drawing back I said the
[12:02] Bible said I take out Kings and not put
[12:04] in Kings the one that we need in the
[12:07] White House is going to get in the white
[12:08] house that's right they ain't worried
[12:10] about it and if I knew who was the one
[12:12] would be able to take us down to bring a
[12:15] bride to a point to where that she would
[12:17] be concerned and I was a casting vote of
[12:20] the finality I'd go cast it in a hurry
[12:22] you know to to get this thing underway
[12:25] amen because you know we we co along
[12:29] here long enough we fought it around
[12:31] horb and all this you know 40 years they
[12:34] did and just kept going around and
[12:36] around finally one day they said let's
[12:39] go
[12:40] across we need to get out of here all
[12:42] right but see it's not the revealing of
[12:45] the Antichrist
[12:48] right it's the revealing of Jesus
[12:52] Christ Through the Bible and then that
[12:55] will make
[12:56] known who the Antichrist who the the
[12:59] devil is that's right oh we know who the
[13:01] devil is he's the god with the
[13:04] horns that's pretty
[13:06] good no yeah he's the guy that used to
[13:10] sit in all of our souls and if you're
[13:12] not born again today he's still sitting
[13:14] there that's right and even after the
[13:17] Born Again experience he's the guy that
[13:19] can still work on the body and
[13:22] spirit that's right I've never seen the
[13:25] devil look in the mirror in the morning
[13:30] that's right and say good morning
[13:32] devil oh no I'm a
[13:36] Christian that's right that's where the
[13:38] deceiving part is at of what he has done
[13:42] and how he's been able to do it right
[13:44] until we get to the point that you know
[13:47] that we we look at him as like something
[13:49] the Bible says he's like a man laying in
[13:51] a ditch
[13:52] right what are you going to do with a
[13:54] drunk laying in the ditch you afraid of
[13:57] him who the devil you have to be careful
[14:00] you know he's powerful he can only do
[14:02] what God lets him do right so then I'm
[14:05] not afraid of
[14:07] him like what brother Al he's not here
[14:10] when he said the other day he said he in
[14:12] there doing something praying or
[14:13] something said the devil C he said Bo
[14:15] devil said sister an's in the other room
[14:20] what loud enough she heard him then boo
[14:23] devil well that's what we ought to do
[14:25] keeping and drive him off right and all
[14:29] you got to do is Boo devil well the best
[14:30] way to boo devil is not to say boo but
[14:33] say Jesus Jesus Jesus that's the boo
[14:37] that I use I don't go around Boo and
[14:39] holler at I just say
[14:41] Jesus take care of this thing Lord come
[14:45] on the scene and take care of everything
[14:47] cuz I can't do it all right let's get
[14:49] down into what we're talking about
[14:52] now see then we saw from the messages we
[14:56] preached on the first SE the first part
[14:59] of there the white horse rider that we
[15:02] saw that that was the
[15:06] Antichrist
[15:07] right and we saw that John talked
[15:11] about in his little John's when after he
[15:13] come back from P patas you know that he
[15:16] talked about an
[15:18] antichrist but see Paul and them they
[15:22] they never said the word Antichrist Paul
[15:24] called it Grievous wolves stuff like
[15:27] that you know all right he would call it
[15:29] many different things and even look
[15:31] forward to seeing the point that when it
[15:34] would come to that there'd be a man of
[15:36] sin to sit in the temple of God shown
[15:38] himself to be as God am sure but yet he
[15:42] still didn't see what John saw right
[15:45] amen because even John was not able to
[15:48] express that when he came back from
[15:50] patmas himself because when the seals
[15:53] were broke they were broken under John
[15:55] and he saw a white horse and a rider
[15:59] their own and he saw that he had a bow
[16:03] and no arrows and and he saw that a
[16:06] crown was given unto him all right now
[16:10] then he goes on to the next that we just
[16:12] read and he saw a red horse and he saw
[16:15] one that begin to kill and do different
[16:18] things and take peace from the earth
[16:22] well John in
[16:24] still now I quoted these over and over
[16:27] to you so I thought well I better get
[16:28] them and read them cuz somebody out
[16:29] there may you may you believe it maybe
[16:32] but somebody else may not well I don't
[16:34] really know brother around the city so I
[16:36] pulled up a couple of things about John
[16:40] admiring this so go ahead brother
[16:43] Anderson and and pull it up and let's
[16:45] read
[16:47] it and look what your Prophet had to say
[16:49] about it see we think that the devil is
[16:52] so thing and like I said some great big
[16:54] monster walking across the Earth like a
[16:56] king kong you know my D know he's going
[16:59] to bow down to
[17:03] me no no it's got to be a religious
[17:07] Society Amen to get you to bow down even
[17:12] uh Hitler was not trying to get him to
[17:15] bow down and and make him
[17:18] God he was just wanting to Ru rule
[17:22] everybody he wouldn't saying you got to
[17:24] bow down and kiss my toe and you got to
[17:26] do this or whatever no
[17:29] he wasn't a religious he was political
[17:33] and he was governmental but not
[17:35] religious
[17:37] right now if you don't get nothing out
[17:39] of the message today get one
[17:42] thing how easily it is to be deceived
[17:47] amen that's right yes sir
[17:51] mhm how easy it is to be
[17:56] deceived we've been told all of our
[18:00] life but this is your right
[18:06] hand
[18:07] well by whose
[18:11] standards a horse is measured not by
[18:14] inches or feet a horse is measured by
[18:17] hands right
[18:20] well some of you have very small hands
[18:24] and you measure a horse by that and then
[18:26] you compare it to brother Arline they
[18:29] used to have them some finger so long
[18:31] until you know i' hated for him to slap
[18:33] me on the face because they would come
[18:35] all the way around the back of my head
[18:37] and hit the other
[18:39] side well now whose hands according to
[18:43] brother Arline then you measure the
[18:45] horse it just be a Shipman
[18:49] Pony but according to some of our hands
[18:52] it might be a great big old tall horse
[18:55] you said well that's no just getting the
[18:58] point of the cross how easily it is to
[19:01] be deceived
[19:04] right that's right and think we're
[19:08] right now we are not
[19:13] against any church of any form
[19:17] right now Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[19:21] Pentecostals Catholics or
[19:25] anything we're not against that we're
[19:27] against the
[19:29] system that caused that to come into
[19:31] being that's right to where churches
[19:34] separate from one another because of
[19:38] doctrines but not because it we're
[19:41] against the
[19:42] people see we we came from
[19:45] there all right and and you know me I
[19:48] don't preach out dire right I preach the
[19:52] deception is in here right where you and
[19:54] I are at cuz what's out there is no
[19:57] concern
[19:59] right see we have wonderful friends and
[20:02] people that are you know out there yeah
[20:07] like I told you the boy called me the
[20:08] other day and left a message and I used
[20:11] to I worked with him for many many years
[20:13] at dville and he said he was going to be
[20:15] baptized and wanted me to come and he
[20:18] then he called me back and told me he
[20:20] left the message we're still talking on
[20:21] the answer machine but anyhow he said he
[20:24] couldn't get it done there was something
[20:25] came up a death in the church but he
[20:28] wanted me to know that he was going to
[20:29] get
[20:30] baptized he also said he was sorry about
[20:33] the way he had talked about me and
[20:36] things as we work together at G
[20:39] Motors I thought that's a great thing
[20:42] am this world is full of good
[20:46] people but when you're deceived you're
[20:49] deceived now that's the
[20:52] Simplicity that I'm trying to get it to
[20:55] each and every one of
[20:57] us
[20:59] we studied the Bible for many years
[21:02] didn't we before we heard of this
[21:03] message yes and we're deceived by
[21:06] understanding or thinking that the Bible
[21:09] was teaching that there was three gods
[21:12] or God in three persons Blessed
[21:15] Trinity and wish wor by those things as
[21:18] being what the Bible had to say
[21:22] right but then we found out that wasn't
[21:24] what it was saying that's
[21:27] right see you know what we were we were
[21:32] deceived Now Eve in the
[21:36] garden in the Garden of
[21:38] Eden Eve was deceived the Bible say
[21:41] right amen she thought she was right
[21:44] right
[21:45] definitely Adam was not deceived the
[21:48] Bible said he he knew what was going on
[21:51] right amen but she was deceived by Satan
[21:55] through the Beast to talk to her
[21:58] right and
[22:00] things and it got into her
[22:03] mentality and it deceived
[22:06] her I've always told you what I believe
[22:09] about
[22:10] that I believe that she actually was
[22:12] thinking that she was bringing forth the
[22:14] promise of
[22:15] God cuz later she said I've gotten a man
[22:18] from the
[22:20] Lord but how deceiving can you be Amen
[22:24] to cause a whole world to come into a
[22:26] chaos what you believe right amen my
[22:31] brother bless God Brother D I'm not
[22:34] deceived well it's kind of like what
[22:38] they say and it's not a joke but they
[22:39] say if you go down to an insane in
[22:42] institution and they'll ask you some
[22:44] questions and they say are you
[22:46] crazy and you say no they said put him
[22:49] over here in s we'll talk to him later
[22:53] if he say well you crazy and they said
[22:54] we are I probably am a little bit they
[22:56] said well put them over there we can
[22:57] help that person go I mean you
[23:00] know we ought to realize that we've all
[23:03] been
[23:05] deceived all right now then you come
[23:09] into this message and look at the
[23:11] doctrines that are flinging oh Lord
[23:13] that's
[23:16] right and did some of you believe those
[23:19] doctrines and where you came from and
[23:21] the things you were in
[23:24] right so what about it how easy it is to
[23:28] be
[23:30] deceived now John sees this situation on
[23:35] patmas he sees a church system so go
[23:38] ahead brother and pull it back up I get
[23:40] to read on
[23:42] it but look what he
[23:44] sees this taken spoken words original SE
[23:48] paragraph
[23:49] 20 The Prostitute of Revelation
[23:53] 17 was a church
[23:56] yep and you know that the Catholic
[23:59] Church admits these things are their
[24:04] Church the mystery the the the the the
[24:07] Babylon coming over and the the
[24:09] things and they admit
[24:12] it you see we Protestants oh no I can't
[24:16] be deceived no we already
[24:19] are
[24:21] right but look what he says the
[24:24] prostitute of Revelation 17 was a church
[24:27] John had ad ired her because of her of
[24:29] her beauty what she was she was a
[24:32] beautiful thing but yet in her was found
[24:35] the blood of every sa of Jesus Christ
[24:38] had been murdered in her
[24:40] yeah what about a deception
[24:43] amen what about a
[24:48] deception that you could think he was
[24:50] right and you kill people
[24:54] y you
[24:56] know you know know that
[24:59] scripture it's scriptural amen let's
[25:03] read
[25:04] it M
[25:07] 21 now now didn't Jesus say there come a
[25:11] time they would kill you thinking they
[25:14] were doing God a service that's right
[25:18] that it's Bible do you need it it's in
[25:20] the scripture it's in the gospels right
[25:23] that Jesus said they'll kill you
[25:24] thinking they're doing God a service
[25:26] right mhm now how far could you be
[25:28] mentality in your mind right so low that
[25:32] you could kill somebody
[25:34] Y and say well I was doing it for your
[25:43] benefit come on
[25:46] Church yep but
[25:51] yet congregation says amen amen maybe a
[25:55] lot of you
[25:56] didn't they did right and they're
[26:00] sincere about
[26:02] that they're not
[26:06] Hypocrites that's right I they believe
[26:10] that right they're taught that
[26:16] m i mean Jesus said they'll kill
[26:23] you and we'll read it in a minute where
[26:25] the Catholic Church under St hippo I
[26:28] believe was his name started to killing
[26:30] and killed 68 million Protestants
[26:35] right you know what they was
[26:39] using the
[26:44] scripture do it say it's better to make
[26:46] people serve God by force than not than
[26:50] to not serve him at
[26:54] all that was what they used right
[26:58] and they backed it up with
[27:00] scriptures of course they were Twisted
[27:04] right but what do we
[27:10] think I don't think there's anybody in
[27:12] the world wants to kill me but there's
[27:13] probably a lot of people that say well
[27:15] you know he is messed up a lot of things
[27:18] so we're better off without him you know
[27:20] yeah but that's all
[27:22] right but look at the
[27:25] prophet he said and their sin he about
[27:28] it amen he said they're not
[27:31] Hypocrites a hypocrite is somebody's not
[27:34] sincere
[27:36] right no Hypocrites what does is what
[27:38] well that's what's you're saying come
[27:43] on what about killing people believing
[27:46] we're right
[27:47] right
[27:50] MH yep wasn't it the Methodist that put
[27:53] John Smith or who who was him back there
[27:55] they put a man to death it was it Luther
[27:58] one of them put in death because of
[28:01] believe in the
[28:04] word
[28:05] no now those are good people I just
[28:10] explained that that's right
[28:14] amen it's bad to say but you know hell
[28:17] is going to be full of good
[28:21] people
[28:24] amen how would you do if you were back
[28:26] in the Dark Ages
[28:28] they would take a cross and then tie you
[28:30] to a you know a cross and or whatever
[28:34] pile sticks around you and get ready to
[28:36] burn
[28:38] you and hold a cross up in front of
[28:41] you you realize a situation I'm talking
[28:44] about yes that here's the group of
[28:47] people that's putting these people to
[28:49] death that they're over here
[28:51] praying let's all pray that this man
[28:54] will get converted before we burn him
[28:59] yeah yeah come on you're talking about
[29:02] religious people right right amen and
[29:07] they're
[29:09] praying that's
[29:12] right not Hypocrites they're
[29:16] praying and they're thinking if we can
[29:18] get that man converted from believing
[29:21] yeah in what what was the argument what
[29:24] was the things back
[29:26] there
[29:28] you don't ever think about
[29:31] it get Fox's book of Martyrs and read it
[29:35] that's
[29:36] right and here's a priest standing with
[29:39] a
[29:40] cross and you're tied to a tree and if
[29:42] it's to burn it deny that God you
[29:45] believe in you look back up and say what
[29:46] do you
[29:47] mean so sir would you explain to me what
[29:50] you
[29:51] mean you deny that God you believe in
[29:54] and you say well don't you believe Jesus
[29:56] Christ died for our sins
[29:58] MH
[30:00] yes I believe it I believe he died for
[30:04] our
[30:04] sins what are you killing me
[30:10] for because you don't believe the Virgin
[30:12] Mary died for your sins yeah amen right
[30:17] come
[30:20] on but get the picture draw it out in
[30:23] your mind y That's right two people
[30:26] looking at each other and both of them
[30:28] claiming to be Christians right right
[30:32] and one of them would be like
[30:34] polycarp it was told to him that when
[30:37] they come to kill him he
[30:40] requested
[30:42] time cooked them a
[30:44] meal let him sit down and eat and pray
[30:48] for 2
[30:50] hours right for the people that had come
[30:54] to take him
[30:56] in
[31:00] well you know what when they sit down to
[31:03] eat he give them a
[31:06] meal
[31:09] right well can't you just see the old
[31:12] priest that walks in or whatever he
[31:14] is Will okay we'll eat you meal PRI says
[31:17] hold a minute God sa a
[31:22] blessing and he prays over the
[31:26] food and sanctifies it in the name of
[31:29] Jesus
[31:32] Christ like come on
[31:35] Church wasn't that what happened
[31:40] yes but see they had come up with the
[31:44] idea that it was better to make you
[31:46] serve God
[31:51] yes and to kill you if you wouldn't do
[31:56] it
[31:58] and even using the scriptures right to
[32:01] back up what they were
[32:03] doing look at the
[32:06] next reing the first seal paragra
[32:16] 328 but now he said he wanted
[32:20] it see they wanted it
[32:25] listen so it give them a strong delusion
[32:28] is that the
[32:31] Bible he knew they wanted it and Paul
[32:35] said they would give him a strong
[32:37] delusion God would to believe a lie and
[32:40] be damned by the lie that you believe
[32:43] righten cuz he knew they wanted
[32:46] it that's
[32:52] right remember the prostitute of
[32:55] Revelation 17
[32:58] she is a mystery
[33:03] yep a mystery is something that you do
[33:06] not
[33:07] understand you understand it's no longer
[33:10] mystery is that
[33:11] sensible
[33:13] right something you don't understand is
[33:16] a mystery yes
[33:22] right so now Revelation 17 is a mystery
[33:26] right it's even call M babblin in your
[33:32] Bible mother of
[33:34] harlots
[33:38] y see then when you look at it you can't
[33:41] see what it
[33:42] is if you do it's not a mystery right
[33:47] right right come
[33:51] on and John admired
[33:54] her just like this man
[33:57] look to wait till we get here and watch
[33:59] him watching this White
[34:02] Horse but you notice he was what
[34:05] happened was this that he admired her
[34:07] with her great
[34:11] admiration married her with great Mar
[34:14] admired her with great
[34:16] admiration but the mystery was that she
[34:18] drank the blood of the martyrs that's
[34:22] right a beautiful
[34:25] church that
[34:27] there decked in purple and gold and she
[34:30] had a cup in her hand all the filter
[34:32] this of her
[34:34] fornication now John admired
[34:41] this you know the thing that I'm talking
[34:44] about is so much a
[34:47] mystery until everybody in the world yep
[34:52] come
[34:53] on but the Lord Jesus Christ
[34:58] was deceived by that mystery
[35:03] amen even the one you claim to be your
[35:07] Prophet
[35:10] amen we'll read it in a minute what did
[35:12] he say he said I'd have made a horrible
[35:15] mistake if the Holy Spirit hadn't
[35:17] corrected
[35:19] me see he used to teach that the white
[35:22] horse rider was the Holy
[35:25] Ghost
[35:34] what he found out it was the
[35:36] Antichrist
[35:38] amen he said later said I've been around
[35:40] this all the time and didn't know
[35:42] exactly what it
[35:45] was I know people out there you ain't
[35:47] going to like that that's all right you
[35:49] you deal with studying the prophet's
[35:54] message what about the greatest Prophet
[35:57] that has ever been on the earth outside
[35:59] the Lord Jesus Christ was
[36:02] deceived by the church system now come
[36:05] on folks let be sensible right he knew
[36:08] they was wrong in this and wrong in that
[36:10] and wrong in this one and wrong in that
[36:12] one right don't be foolish in you're
[36:17] thinking he knew that the Baptist had
[36:20] wrong the Methodist had wrong they they
[36:22] taught a trinity they they baptized
[36:24] father son Holy Ghost right
[36:29] right they believe hell was
[36:32] eternal and the serpent seed was eaten
[36:38] apple he knew all that was
[36:44] wrong right but
[36:49] yet that Antichrist was
[36:52] so close to Jesus
[36:55] Christ
[36:57] yep until the world was deceived
[37:03] amen and so was a prophet until
[37:06] 1963 when that first seal broke to
[37:12] him and you and I are still deceived by
[37:15] it I don't care how much you can quote
[37:17] amen until that seal is revealed to you
[37:21] and I amen that's why I drive it so hard
[37:27] to say we get the revelation of the seal
[37:30] that's right we don't get the literal
[37:33] happening under those things that's
[37:35] right amen we look back and see that
[37:38] that I doing the other day going all the
[37:40] way back to Genesis right
[37:44] amen going back to the garden and Eve
[37:47] being deceived who was doing that Satan
[37:50] amen you agree
[37:54] sir watch when he getting down in a
[37:56] little
[37:57] bit he instilled into a man named
[38:02] Cain he got eased mind and took her into
[38:06] adultery right he got into a man named
[38:12] Cain and don't you think they talked
[38:14] about what they were doing

[38:22] y able was just laying where taking care
[38:25] of the Sheep was out there working like
[38:28] crazy any of you ever put out a
[38:32] garden that's what he was
[38:34] doing he was digging out all of the rock
[38:37] getting out everything right and making
[38:39] a beautiful place for a garden and
[38:41] raising those things that he brought for
[38:43] his own
[38:45] offering and he was making fun of
[38:48] Abel and he said AB what you going to do
[38:51] tomorrow we got to give a sacrifice you
[38:55] know and said I'll have
[38:59] mine Cain worked yourself to death
[39:01] sweated like
[39:07] everything they come a day for the
[39:10] sacrifice Cain laid all of his out able
[39:13] went over in the flock and got a
[39:16] lamb come
[39:19] back might not at that time had a
[39:23] knife know that was probably later on
[39:25] when the steel to be able to be molded
[39:28] and made into
[39:31] metal he took a rock the prophet said
[39:35] and cut that animal
[39:39] stro can't you just see

[40:13] to a Doctrine to a rule of
[40:20] life he turned around and
[40:23] killed a y yes and when we get over in

[40:37] right that's what I'm trying to tie
[40:40] together for you to get you to see it
[40:42] those seals go all the way back to
[40:43] Genesis and comes down through and we
[40:46] see it by
[40:49] Revelation and then when it goes to
[40:54] Israel the man of sin was in the temple
[40:56] of God showing himself to be as God
[41:00] Satan

[44:11] messed
[44:13] up why didn't they dig up the bones of
[44:17] those priests and throw them in the
[44:19] river to show a repentance cuz they did

[44:25] times
[44:27] Jonah arc when they finally found out

[44:33] the bones and which meant symbolically
[44:36] that those people were lost right right

[44:57] killing again right
[44:59] brother amen you know that they got to

[45:14] hun I believe it's his name was
[45:17] hun but he killed over a th000 people in

[45:30] ain't
[45:33] it well come on have you been to a
[45:35] funeral lately everybody's going to
[45:39] heaven like brother Steven Wilson says
[45:41] they going to do away with hell cuz
[45:42] ain't nobody going
[45:45] there I'm not against
[45:49] that I'm not saying it wrong I'm just
[45:52] saying it
[45:54] right
[45:57] if that person is born again they're
[46:00] going to heaven if they're not I don't
[46:03] care what good works how many times you
[46:05] paid the parking lot or painted the
[46:08] church right or how much money you put
[46:10] in the offering plate
[46:15] that's I heard one time about years ago
[46:17] and the said man that got pretty bad I
[46:20] saw him put $2 an offering plate one
[46:23] time more that put him in heaven
[46:26] what's the difference in that in paying
[46:27] the
[46:29] Purgatory come on you know it's right to
[46:32] pay them out of
[46:34] purgatory right this L Pope was so good
[46:37] he made a Whistle
[46:39] Stop L Pope was so great a guy he made a
[46:42] whistle sto in hell yeah go they believe
[46:45] everybody going to
[46:47] hell Purgatory what you want to call D
[46:50] made a Whistle Stop he just slowed down
[46:53] and rode through and they done prayed
[46:55] him out
[46:58] out
[47:01] yeah I kind of like what the person said
[47:05] one time and it's giv money to pay them
[47:07] to the priest to pay them pray them out
[47:09] of hell you know
[47:11] Purgatory they said we got him all out
[47:13] but one
[47:19] foot people tell F said he was a pretty
[47:22] good athlete he can walk without it
[47:25] leave his foot we done pay all we pay
[47:29] you say those things are
[47:31] silly believe right we say that's
[47:36] silly but what little concept do you
[47:39] have that's right Amen Brother D I
[47:43] believe brother R was a
[47:44] prophet that gives you PL excuse me that
[47:49] gives you front row in hell
[47:53] right you don't like that or know
[47:57] right that reserves your front row seat
[48:00] called first El Li Li first so you get a
[48:03] front row seat in hell for believ in the
[48:06] prophet Welly there's a lot of Internet
[48:08] went out that that's all
[48:11] right I didn't ask you to listen I'm
[48:14] just trying to preach the
[48:16] truth but you see if you're born
[48:19] again that's it that took me out of hell
[48:21] and give me a front row seat in heaven
[48:24] right amen if you're born again
[48:26] that way then I can believe a prophet
[48:28] cuz my Bible says no man can call Jesus
[48:31] the Christ right other than by the holy
[48:34] ghost that was in
[48:37] him not because he believed a prophet
[48:39] that's right right if you got the Holy
[48:41] Ghost you will believe the prophet
[48:43] there's no problems with
[48:46] it if we don't then we'll argue over
[48:48] ideas and thoughts amen okay doing
[48:52] pretty
[48:54] good
[48:56] now let's just make sure that we
[48:58] understand
[48:59] something follow a little point but I
[49:02] know this is
[49:04] reviewing but you know sometimes
[49:07] reviewing
[49:08] helps sir some of these quotes we've
[49:12] already given but sometimes it's good to
[49:14] give them amen that's good and to just
[49:18] see what the real truth of it is that's
[49:21] right to find that where or not whether
[49:24] or not we are received
[49:27] amen this is like I've tried to explain
[49:29] to
[49:31] you people say well understand one God
[49:34] water baptism no eternal hell serpent
[49:36] seeds seals Thunders plags this I don't
[49:41] understand Daniel 7
[49:42] weeks that's
[49:44] right well now I've always made it plain
[49:48] to you mhm I believe one God has got to
[49:51] be revealed to you just exactly like
[49:54] Daniel said weeks has to be revealed
[49:57] that's
[49:57] right that's right serpent seed has to
[50:01] be revealed to you just exactly like one
[50:04] God has to be
[50:06] revealed how many of you remember when
[50:09] you first started reading even the
[50:11] prophet's message about one
[50:15] God and that Old Devil
[50:18] says Welly he believes in God in three
[50:20] person listen at it he said let's stand
[50:22] address the third person of the trinity
[50:26] well he BL a three God
[50:31] seei how many of you argued about the
[50:34] revelation of one God when you first
[50:37] heard it
[50:43] right come
[50:44] on let's go a little
[50:47] deeper how many of you went to the water
[50:49] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[50:51] when you first heard about the one
[50:54] God see that's where people don't like
[50:57] me you don't like me cuz I've heard
[51:00] people right here say boy when I first
[51:01] seen it I've done it and I remember it
[51:04] took me about 6 months to get you
[51:08] baptized and it certainly wasn't dry
[51:10] weather no Creek to baptize
[51:14] in
[51:15] right is because you didn't want it done
[51:18] because you didn't believe
[51:21] it when I first seen it man when I first
[51:24] seen I done it
[51:26] 5 years or
[51:27] something I got an office come sit down
[51:30] in
[51:31] it and I'll explain all them messages I
[51:35] preached and you frowned and Grom and
[51:38] went all and told everybody else how
[51:40] wrong I
[51:42] was Brother D missed it right
[51:49] here see I'm just
[51:53] honest I saw the one God because that's
[51:55] a bad this Doctrine brother Mo blowed me
[51:58] away on that one where he said it's a
[52:00] person it's a personality personality is
[52:02] an individual individ person your
[52:04] Trinity like anybody else I said don't
[52:06] believe that no more that didn't mean I
[52:07] understood everything I just knew that
[52:10] the man had took the scriptures and
[52:12] demoted me totally out of the
[52:14] way but it took me about 6 months to get
[52:21] baptized Oh you mean you're honest
[52:24] enough to admit it yeah sure it
[52:26] is how long it take
[52:33] you you know that I had to preach a good
[52:35] bit here one time on one little fact
[52:38] that a lot of people in this church
[52:39] would baptize in the name of Jesus
[52:41] Christ but it was baptized under
[52:43] regeneration that's under a
[52:46] denominational Doctrine and then some
[52:49] finally come and said I believe I need
[52:50] to get baptized again I said thank you
[52:54] toall
[52:57] because if you were baptized believing
[52:59] it was under regeneration
[53:02] right how deceiving are you that's right
[53:05] I'm not carnal I'm not funny but if all
[53:09] it takes is for you to baptize anybody
[53:11] I'll meet you on Lake laner this
[53:12] afternoon we won't have an evening
[53:14] service but everybody that come by that
[53:16] Lake will go in that water one way or
[53:17] the other you know that ain't going to
[53:20] save
[53:22] them no that's right if that's all it
[53:26] takes
[53:28] right see church trying to get us to see
[53:32] how easy it is to be deceived
[53:38] amen mama told me
[53:43] this mama told me this well
[53:49] Glory but was mama
[53:52] right right see we're in the with a
[53:55] computer now you can't argue mama said
[53:57] it
[54:00] right right you just run it in the
[54:02] computer and you can find out if mama
[54:04] said it or if it was Mama's idea about
[54:06] what brother R
[54:07] said right
[54:10] right you see how easy it is to be
[54:13] deceived right amen yes that's
[54:17] right you believe a lie the Bible
[54:21] says and be down by it in vain the
[54:25] scripture says you worship me teaching
[54:27] for Doctrine the Commandments of
[54:34] men
[54:39] right you remember the story that
[54:42] brother Brandon was telling about the
[54:43] Jew that he was talking to
[54:45] and the old Jew couldn't get nothing
[54:48] over on brother brand because he trapped
[54:49] him with the scripture showing and
[54:50] asking him the question of who do you
[54:52] believe the Messiah will be and he said
[54:54] it' be God mhm so the man finally went
[54:56] up said that man Jesus said he was a
[55:02] thief but see what would most of us have
[55:05] ever come up with somebody told you
[55:08] Jesus was a thief what would you say
[55:10] well where was he a
[55:12] Fai no preach said he went through the
[55:14] corn field
[55:17] yeah and took
[55:20] corn little around said hold it sir
[55:24] you're own scripture says that it's
[55:27] lawful for you to go through a man's
[55:29] corn field and eat your field it said
[55:32] you can't put none in the stack and take
[55:34] it with you that's
[55:36] Bible that's how the poor folks was
[55:39] taken care of back then right you
[55:43] know
[55:45] right but how easy it is to be
[55:52] deceived what do we think about it pull
[55:54] up number one brother let's get started
[55:56] on we'll go a little while
[55:58] anyway taking for the first seal
[56:00] paragraph 266 you've heard this one
[56:03] before but that's what mankind thought
[56:06] but around thought
[56:08] it he thought that the white horse rider
[56:10] was the Holy Spirit that went forth in
[56:13] the early
[56:15] ages with his little arrow you know
[56:18] little bow and a little arrow shooting
[56:20] like cupid
[56:22] remember had a bow in his hand
[56:25] which meant like cupid he shot the
[56:27] arrows of love into the hearts of the
[56:29] people the love of God and he
[56:33] conquered that's what mankind used to
[56:35] believe that's what he believed the one
[56:37] horse rider
[56:39] was cuz he had a
[56:44] bow now that sounds very
[56:48] good you know why cuz that's the way he
[56:50] used to believe a little different form
[56:53] Maybe
[56:55] mhm right yep come on no sir that it
[57:00] wasn't what does mean righteous we
[57:03] realize that that b means righteous the
[57:06] teachers taught
[57:07] it what they teach that it was the Holy
[57:10] Spirit conquering in the first age but
[57:13] my revelation of it by the holy spirit
[57:16] is not that
[57:18] way now a revelation is going to
[57:21] straighten out a false Doctrine yes
[57:25] right that's the only way of false
[57:29] Doctrine can be straightened out yes is
[57:31] by
[57:34] Revelation right that's right now he's
[57:37] talking about the world religious
[57:42] system well trained
[57:45] people this church that John
[57:50] admired and little old Prophet with a
[57:53] seventh grade education
[57:58] and my Revelation not right
[58:02] there other words God has revealed
[58:04] something to
[58:06] me I'm going to tell you what he's
[58:08] revealed to
[58:10] me but my revelation of it is by the
[58:13] holy spirit is not that way my
[58:14] Revelation by the holy spirit is Christ
[58:17] and the Holy Spirit is the selfs same
[58:21] person see only in a different form
[58:25] so here stands Christ the lamb we know
[58:28] and he was the lamb we know he was the
[58:30] lamb he's standing here with the books
[58:32] in his hand and there goes the white
[58:36] horse rider see so it wasn't the Holy
[58:40] Spirit right
[58:43] amen now to a trinitarian what does it
[58:45] matter how many persons or personalities
[58:48] have you got y
[58:52] right they have riding all over the
[58:54] place FL don't matter to
[58:58] them but Dar stands a prophet with a
[59:01] revelation that the Holy Ghost In Christ
[59:04] is the selfs same
[59:10] person and out
[59:13] goes a white horse
[59:16] rider and I ask you to read the seal
[59:19] book there the first seal and see how
[59:20] many times he called him a he or a him
[59:23] or a guy or a person riding off
[59:32] y I ain't asking for no raise of hands
[59:34] for how many ready CU there probably be
[59:37] very
[59:39] few but you know all about it
[59:42] yes I know I'm hateful right if we was
[59:46] in school and I gave you that to read
[59:49] and you didn't read it you got a goose
[59:52] EG that's right that's right all right
[59:58] that's that's what I told you about then
[1:00:01] when we was going to that ministers
[1:00:04] meeting I said there'll probably be 30
[1:00:07] people there and at least 10 out of them
[1:00:08] has never even read a book and you know
[1:00:11] that some of them admitted they had
[1:00:15] never seen a drawing that brother
[1:00:17] Brandon made on the 70
[1:00:20] weeks never seen
[1:00:23] one yet
[1:00:25] waai now was
[1:00:27] wrong
[1:00:29] yeah we
[1:00:33] wrong because it's what I
[1:00:37] believe well you remember what happened
[1:00:39] in the
[1:00:41] garden you remember the prophet making a
[1:00:43] statement one
[1:00:45] day that Cain said to God y That's not
[1:00:50] in the Bible but this is the prophet
[1:00:52] translating what was happening
[1:00:55] Cain said to God he said I've done all
[1:00:58] I'm going to
[1:00:59] do take it or leave
[1:01:03] it he said and God left it right how
[1:01:08] horrible could a person be right to tell
[1:01:12] God that had told you what to do they
[1:01:14] said if you'll do like your brother
[1:01:16] you'll be accepted yep right that have
[1:01:19] not seen life at the door he had an
[1:01:22] opportunity right there amen
[1:01:25] amen amen but instead he said God you
[1:01:28] take it or leave it I'm not doing
[1:01:30] anything
[1:01:33] else now how many of you have said or
[1:01:37] heard people
[1:01:39] say the Baptist is good enough for
[1:01:44] Mama or
[1:01:46] Daddy it's good enough for me y That's
[1:01:50] My Mama died a Baptist I'm going to be a
[1:01:53] Baptist
[1:01:56] you ever heard that sure come
[1:02:01] on what's the difference right in the
[1:02:04] deception
[1:02:06] amen but listen church I know when I
[1:02:10] preach the way I preach it and I want
[1:02:13] you to
[1:02:15] listen but why can't you thank God for
[1:02:17] what he's reveal to
[1:02:19] you right for one time just sit down and
[1:02:22] think God look what you've done for me
[1:02:26] do that for somebody else instead of
[1:02:29] thinking brother Dale is such a hateful
[1:02:31] person to preach
[1:02:34] against
[1:02:35] churches and
[1:02:38] people don't you love him for what he
[1:02:40] showed you that's right I didn't choose
[1:02:45] this I didn't choose to be what I
[1:02:53] am I don't like to be hard and
[1:03:01] preach I love
[1:03:03] people I want to help
[1:03:06] them but I can't help what he reveals to
[1:03:09] me that's
[1:03:11] right am I to apologize for what God
[1:03:14] reveals no
[1:03:17] sir see because you don't hear me say
[1:03:21] things like other people
[1:03:23] say
[1:03:25] and I'm not against it that's between
[1:03:28] that person and
[1:03:30] God if my mother and my daddy was a born
[1:03:33] again Christian for the time they live
[1:03:36] they'll be there in the bride amen but
[1:03:40] if they
[1:03:41] wasn't they won't be there that's
[1:03:46] right I've always been honest with
[1:03:49] you if they weren't born again they
[1:03:51] won't be
[1:03:53] there maybe God will give him eternal
[1:03:55] life for bringing me
[1:03:58] that's just a great thing to be the
[1:04:01] bride of Christ
[1:04:03] amen amen sure in my heart I hurt to try
[1:04:07] to help people and talk to them and see
[1:04:09] them just turn it down you know that's
[1:04:11] right I want to see people believe in it
[1:04:13] amen that's
[1:04:17] right look what the next one look what
[1:04:20] he says on the next one paragraph 190
[1:04:22] the second seal
[1:04:27] now first he become an
[1:04:30] antichrist now he couldn't be Antichrist
[1:04:34] only in spirit that's where F started
[1:04:37] out remember the other day we're
[1:04:41] talking when he first started out it was
[1:04:43] just a
[1:04:44] spirit didn't he become an antichrist
[1:04:46] look and that Spirit took a man that
[1:04:49] taught the same things that that
[1:04:52] Antichrist Spirit was was
[1:04:55] doing
[1:04:57] listen then he became a false prophet to
[1:05:01] the Antichrist
[1:05:03] Spirit now look at the next one I didn't
[1:05:06] say
[1:05:07] it what about a man in an
[1:05:15] organization shot yourself he said I
[1:05:19] don't know what you think about it but
[1:05:20] all
[1:05:23] right
[1:05:25] see what's he
[1:05:28] saying an antichrist Spirit working upon
[1:05:31] you right but if you become one with
[1:05:34] that
[1:05:35] Spirit you'll stay in an organized
[1:05:38] religion amen that's right or you'll
[1:05:40] come in this
[1:05:41] message and cause Havoc or how however
[1:05:44] you say it
[1:05:46] chaos to teach your
[1:05:49] Doctrine
[1:05:51] yep right right
[1:05:57] see an antichrist Spirit you can't Crown
[1:05:59] a spirit right
[1:06:01] right it's just the spirit it was first
[1:06:04] the spirit to
[1:06:11] came but then it become a Doctrine
[1:06:15] right a prophet to a system came become
[1:06:19] a
[1:06:20] prophet to his false Doctrine sure
[1:06:25] then Cain become incarnate with it Y and
[1:06:29] says take it or leave
[1:06:33] it I'm a
[1:06:35] pope you remember how we brought that
[1:06:39] out but you know what he became he
[1:06:41] became a beast yep and Rose up and
[1:06:44] killed his own blood brother
[1:06:47] yep and then when God come checking on
[1:06:50] Abel he said am I My Brother's Keeper

[1:07:08] and everything he said you can't send me
[1:07:10] out there they'll kill
[1:07:12] me remember the Bible y but the Bible
[1:07:15] said God put a mark on

[1:13:01] that ate it down so then God has to come
[1:13:04] back with justification sanctification
[1:13:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost Incarnate Word
[1:13:10] amen right but see it's correct way of
[1:13:14] doing things is father son holy cost
[1:13:18] amen right God is
[1:13:21] fre this is four about the
[1:13:24] Antichrist he's in four here first
[1:13:27] Antichrist why that's the first SE
[1:13:31] second false prophet red third VI of
[1:13:35] heavens and earth and Purgatory
[1:13:38] black fourth the Beast Pale Horse Satan
[1:13:43] being kicked out of heaven you got to be
[1:13:45] kicked out of heaven before he can
[1:13:46] become the Beast amen right I love that
[1:13:49] yep he's up right right now the Bible
[1:13:51] says accusing the brethren
[1:13:54] but he's going to be kicked
[1:13:56] out see we're going to have a spiritual
[1:13:59] Army again amen not a physical arm again
[1:14:02] we're going to have a spiritual one in
[1:14:03] our lives and we're not getting out of
[1:14:05] here these seals didn't apply to us in
[1:14:08] every
[1:14:10] form but they don't they've done been
[1:14:13] open for us right Jesus preached six
[1:14:16] seals in Matthew 24 that's right amen
[1:14:20] and was the saath himself amen
[1:14:27] MH so then what is it the four stages
[1:14:31] what
[1:14:33] Antichrist false
[1:14:36] prophet vior of Heaven and Earth which
[1:14:39] makes him
[1:14:41] what a pope
[1:14:45] right a
[1:14:47] pope see the Antichrist didn't kill
[1:14:51] nobody Spirits don't kill people
[1:14:54] right false prophet that moved on the
[1:14:57] scene with it number
[1:14:59] two he just started that
[1:15:07] Doctrine first I seeing
[1:15:10] counil was not over one God or
[1:15:13] three it was over whether Jesus was God
[1:15:16] or a light
[1:15:18] substance and reenan Creed that come
[1:15:21] from it that stat said in her own Creed
[1:15:24] Jesus is the substance of
[1:15:27] God but the idea of the doctrine had
[1:15:30] done been planted into the man people's
[1:15:32] mind and brother said to bride or not
[1:15:35] have went to n right you can say well
[1:15:38] they left out Bo they didn't get to see
[1:15:40] yes they brought brother said they
[1:15:42] brought back with them you don't read
[1:15:45] enough to read them things bless God I
[1:15:48] believe it I believe the true bride
[1:15:49] couldn't go to nille then you're making
[1:15:52] your prophet lie cuz he said they
[1:15:55] did go
[1:15:59] on forget
[1:16:02] it you believe the doctrine y you go
[1:16:05] where the doctrine come from
[1:16:09] yep because the first was an antichrist
[1:16:12] second was a prophet false prophet to a
[1:16:16] false
[1:16:18] word by 606 the pope had done come into
[1:16:22] to you
[1:16:25] 3:25 ad they was beginning to move into
[1:16:29] that realm y by 606 they had done change
[1:16:34] to water baptism they had done set the
[1:16:36] pope into view and he started killing
[1:16:39] the
[1:16:44] people because he's become an incarnate
[1:16:47] false
[1:16:50] prophet and remember when what we read
[1:16:53] one ago your Prophet said they were not
[1:16:57] Hypocrites they believe what they were
[1:16:59] doing was what God told them to do right
[1:17:03] that's right the Bible says that it'll
[1:17:06] come to a time that what is it father
[1:17:09] will be against son son against father
[1:17:13] mother against this mother-in-law
[1:17:16] against
[1:17:17] that all kind of
[1:17:22] things
[1:17:25] why because people believe they're right
[1:17:31] right what stage are you and I in I'll
[1:17:33] quit right what stage are we
[1:17:40] in not to change the title brother Joe
[1:17:43] race out that second seal and this
[1:17:49] put
[1:17:51] people this what people on there cuz
[1:17:54] that's what we are how easy is it to be
[1:17:57] deceived
[1:18:00] amen oh but I can't be
[1:18:04] deceived what people quote that from
[1:18:06] Brother they don't never go over there
[1:18:07] and find the one where he said frankly
[1:18:10] it get them messed up that's right and
[1:18:13] if he didn't cut the work short I'm
[1:18:15] quoting him he said there'd be no flesh
[1:18:20] saved oh but that means on over
[1:18:25] there I don't believe
[1:18:28] it I know the bride cannot be deceived
[1:18:30] and take them to hell that's right
[1:18:33] that's right but what do you think has
[1:18:35] taken all the people to the Grave
[1:18:40] right when Martin Luther the great man
[1:18:43] the preacher just shall live by faith in
[1:18:45] God ring down through Glory with
[1:18:48] that yet he turned around and said the
[1:18:51] Jews ought to be killed that they were
[1:18:54] Antichrist
[1:18:58] right why because he was not a
[1:19:01] prophet he was under the
[1:19:06] man and he couldn't come forth with the
[1:19:08] last day message
[1:19:12] right you see
[1:19:14] Church how easy is it for us to be
[1:19:18] deceived amen
[1:19:21] right like I told you I went to preach
[1:19:24] for a brother one time and I thought he
[1:19:27] believed the message I preached simple
[1:19:29] little message i k p Bap and the Holy
[1:19:31] Ghost and I encourage people with a
[1:19:33] simple statement I've always made to you
[1:19:35] how many you ever heard this
[1:19:38] statement I'd rather go through life
[1:19:40] seeking God for the baptism of the Holy
[1:19:42] Ghost and come to the end of the road
[1:19:44] and find out I've got it than to go
[1:19:46] through life thinking I got it wind up
[1:19:48] in the road and find out I don't have it
[1:19:50] how many times ever made that statement
[1:19:52] probably about
[1:19:54] 8,432 you know or
[1:19:57] 31 but I preached a simple little
[1:20:00] message a brother got mad at
[1:20:03] me another brother told me that that
[1:20:06] brother's mad at you I went to his
[1:20:08] house when I found out he was mad at me
[1:20:11] I said what are you mad
[1:20:14] about you come here and preached in my
[1:20:18] church that I had my people build on the
[1:20:21] word and said you got him to seeking
[1:20:25] God I said brother I apologize for
[1:20:29] preaching in your church something you
[1:20:30] didn't believe I thought you were a
[1:20:32] Pentecostal that believed in
[1:20:34] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:20:35] of the Holy Ghost I apologize for
[1:20:38] preaching something you don't believe
[1:20:40] but I will never apologize for getting
[1:20:43] people to seek
[1:20:44] God I will never do that amen I want you
[1:20:48] to se God until you know that's right
[1:20:52] that you you know come on that you know
[1:20:55] what's right
[1:20:57] right that you know God
[1:20:59] lives
[1:21:01] right you know that there is a God
[1:21:04] that's real yes not a
[1:21:08] mythology not a thought in your
[1:21:16] mind but to know that he's real
[1:21:20] am and you know what he's so real he'll
[1:21:23] talk to you he'll just fellowship with
[1:21:25] you if you'll let him
[1:21:28] amen you'll come right down and talk to
[1:21:30] you right in the middle of the
[1:21:37] night what's the matter you don't
[1:21:38] believe in the kind of God no God only
[1:21:41] speaks to the
[1:21:43] prophet
[1:21:46] well it's like some of them said one
[1:21:48] time that I was a
[1:21:50] prophet and I withstood it from the pull
[1:21:53] pit and said I am not a prophet in the
[1:21:55] fivefold ministry they would say when I
[1:21:58] was going up said I was a prophet in the
[1:22:00] fivefold ministry I said no that's
[1:22:02] wrong I am not a prophet in the fful
[1:22:05] ministry I said well the word comes to
[1:22:07] you my Prophet said the word comes to
[1:22:10] the spirit fi so then if you'll take it
[1:22:12] that we're all prophets in the body of
[1:22:14] Christ I'll go along with you if you're
[1:22:18] saying we're all prophets in the body
[1:22:21] because this is a prophetic age that
[1:22:23] we're living in then I'll go along with
[1:22:25] you
[1:22:26] 100% I don't have the ministry of a
[1:22:29] prophet if you going to make me anything
[1:22:31] make me a teacher leave it
[1:22:34] alone why because
[1:22:37] God is here to deal in your heart and
[1:22:40] your
[1:22:42] life I loved it years ago when I read
[1:22:44] where the Propet said when the prophets
[1:22:48] come and it took a long time to study
[1:22:51] that now but you see on the day of
[1:22:53] Pentecost on the zeusa street the Holy
[1:22:55] Ghost came back brother R said in a
[1:22:58] great prophet to every Born Again
[1:23:01] believer on ausus Street had the baptism
[1:23:04] of the Holy Ghost the great prophet the
[1:23:07] Holy
[1:23:09] Spirit ever born again believer today
[1:23:12] has within you the prophet of
[1:23:15] God am but this is the prophetic Agee
[1:23:21] amen but that way we just don't build up
[1:23:25] nobody you said well why don't you tell
[1:23:27] the truth I'm trying my best to tell the
[1:23:31] truth I'm just part of the body of
[1:23:33] Christ you get to looking at me as a
[1:23:36] prophet you'll try to get me to discern
[1:23:37] out things in your life and tell you
[1:23:39] different things that won't work cuz I
[1:23:41] don't have a gift
[1:23:44] sure God has spoke to
[1:23:46] me well I a witness she told me last
[1:23:50] night B my head
[1:23:55] Sara she punched me what's the
[1:23:59] matter I tried to tell her but I
[1:24:02] couldn't I saw something sure that's
[1:24:06] fine but you can do the same
[1:24:09] pain if you just yield yourself to God
[1:24:13] and believe him he wants to deal with
[1:24:16] you the same as he does everybody
[1:24:19] else I don't make nothing out of any of
[1:24:22] us he makes a great God Among Us
[1:24:25] Amen to reveal
[1:24:28] itself the hour that we
[1:24:31] living understand how easy is it to be
[1:24:37] deceived all we got to do is believe
[1:24:39] Satan's life brother said believe
[1:24:42] Satan's life is what serve
[1:24:45] Satan what he
[1:24:48] said go ahead brother 139 spir book
[1:24:52] anybody have a
[1:24:53] need open I'm
