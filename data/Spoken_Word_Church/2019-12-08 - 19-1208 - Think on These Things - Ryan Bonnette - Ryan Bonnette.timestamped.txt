[0:59] then we'll look there if anybody had to
[1:01] give in the box
[1:03] ladies taking care of it so you can give
[1:05] it to it okay all right going good today
[1:10] we're going to talk about think on these
[1:12] things I want to talk a lot about
[1:13] meditation for the way it's been on the
[1:15] book of Philippians so I think this will
[1:17] fit in nice because I'm gonna focus on
[1:19] one scripture and that's Philippians 4:8
[1:21] there's a scripture about meditation and
[1:24] I think it's a key that we overlook a
[1:26] lot as Christian meditation is a very
[1:28] powerful tool and I've never thought it
[1:31] was just for the ministers I know the
[1:32] ministers meditate a lot on their
[1:33] sermons but I think it's for late even
[1:36] for the sister everybody ought to think
[1:38] about things you've heard preached the
[1:40] the sermons you Mista to go around them
[1:42] the scripture you read and even things
[1:46] that happen in your life we'll get into
[1:47] natural and spiritual journey of things
[1:50] that you should meditate on okay
[1:52] but it's been a very powerful tool in my
[1:55] life thing that's helped me a lot
[1:58] recently we've heard preached brother
[2:01] Aaron he preached a little bit a while
[2:03] back I don't remember the title of the
[2:05] sermon but in his sermon he was
[2:06] preaching about talking about just
[2:09] natural testimonies in his life saying
[2:11] so he's still not rehearsing right
[2:12] rehearsing the things we're saying the
[2:14] things we've heard because you can so
[2:16] easily put things
[2:17] sweep things under the rug kind of
[2:19] forget
[2:20] things that the lowest done they talked
[2:21] about his grandfather I think was in
[2:23] World War two and a company of something
[2:26] like 50 to I think only two of them
[2:28] survived or something like that you said
[2:29] he testified about that there was this
[2:32] force field or something that was the
[2:34] victim they were being fired at by the
[2:35] enemy and they could hear these bullets
[2:38] ricocheting off of something that they
[2:40] couldn't even see so the Lord was
[2:42] protecting him to get brother Aaron
[2:45] brother Richard here and so forth Stevie
[2:47] I was away and all those things and
[2:48] those things we should never forget
[2:50] never overlooked because even in our
[2:52] natural journey of life God is working
[2:54] got it moving and all of that so to
[2:56] meditate on that yeah he also talked
[2:59] about his mom it was sick really bad now
[3:01] recently his dad brother Bill Roberts it
[3:03] was sick and he's all looking a lot
[3:05] better now over here and God was with us
[3:08] and so many things we overlooked you
[3:09] mean even brother Bob preached about I
[3:13] think this was two or three sermons ago
[3:15] for tried testing the proven and in that
[3:18] he mentioned the testimony I don't know
[3:20] each other I may get mixed up but he he
[3:23] lost his job I think he got laid off
[3:24] when Zach and Esther perform Maria after
[3:28] Esther born so they have two small
[3:30] children I'm guessing one handgun right
[3:33] and lost his job all right
[3:35] now he's going to the doctor I had place
[3:38] to be when you don't have a lot of money
[3:39] you know and then on a windy day and his
[3:42] paycheck blows out of the car and it's
[3:44] gone he says lord I need that that's my
[3:46] last check what that sound like to me
[3:49] I'm thinking first King 17 the widow
[3:51] woman right and she's down to her last
[3:53] handful of mill and looking a little
[3:55] bitter all done crews and well I just
[3:57] said make me a cake first and she said
[3:59] well I've got enough to make one for me
[4:00] my son we're gonna eat it and die but
[4:02] the Bob's down this last little resource
[4:04] last paycheck and it blows away I said
[4:05] lord I need that and on this windy day
[4:07] something I think put its finger on that
[4:10] paycheck and held him down said three
[4:11] stops glass champion and he's alright
[4:16] today okay but that was a trial and
[4:18] that's just a simple thing that he went
[4:20] through edifying help him yeah but God
[4:21] was doing that and if you don't see God
[4:24] in the trials even the wind blowing with
[4:26] you and I think a part of that
[4:28] and waves are a type of tribulations
[4:32] trials things we go through that's not
[4:33] always when when you're going through a
[4:35] trial but a lot of times there will be
[4:37] right the point is those things type
[4:39] something going on spiritually it was a
[4:41] great thing he should I know he won't
[4:42] forget that but that impresses on my
[4:45] mind these little things that I hear of
[4:47] your natural journey of trials you go
[4:48] through yeah and we've been through hell
[4:50] yeah man and also we think of mark for
[4:54] whether the Jesus was asleep on the back
[4:56] of the ship and the winds and waves were
[4:58] being accosted him around and yet they
[5:01] went to wake from semester with parish
[5:02] you know there's always those type of
[5:04] things to try to test us well the words
[5:06] say the Rotter says we were trying to
[5:08] have been take on the work you can
[5:10] expect a trial the comments all right
[5:12] yes but they'll at the end of every
[5:15] sermon he reminds us he almost every
[5:17] sermon he says at the end of it think on
[5:19] these things but things he's just been
[5:21] preaching about which is always open
[5:23] pretending to Redemption always
[5:24] something pertaining to our journey
[5:26] something to do with the things that
[5:29] Paul mentions in that verse that we'll
[5:31] get to hearing many many years and then
[5:34] the weeks that's the question he's
[5:35] always asking us to reflect on herself
[5:37] but it always seemed like every sermons
[5:39] about something about self-reflection
[5:41] meditation that were part of meditation
[5:43] you think on your way think about the
[5:46] journey of comfort because he was
[5:47] talking about thinking on what kind of
[5:52] fruit are you Barry
[5:55] I'm thinking on what kind of fruits
[5:57] you're bearing you know and so all these
[6:01] things we've heard recently are pertains
[6:02] to that all right and I would say this
[6:06] too don't overlook any one part of your
[6:08] journey has been insignificant or like
[6:10] God's not in it because he's in the
[6:11] least little details naturally and
[6:13] spiritually there's a lot of things God
[6:15] does to lead us that we overlook and
[6:17] think it's just haphazard or arbitrary
[6:19] just something just happens at random
[6:20] well it's not you're not a god you're
[6:23] being led of God you know that now we've
[6:28] known this to the I started saying well
[6:30] about ministers getting all their
[6:31] sermons through meditation by the way we
[6:33] often hear you make the comment I was
[6:35] talking to the Lord the other day that's
[6:36] meditation on lawnmower and the male car
[6:39] wherever for me it's in the chicken
[6:40] truck brother Dale was that General
[6:42] Motors doing a job it took three people
[6:44] to fill in forms he'd be sitting there
[6:46] writing notes for the sales you know
[6:48] things like that whatever you do you can
[6:50] find somewhere to fit this meditation
[6:52] into your daily devotional whether it be
[6:53] a long commute to work or whether it be
[6:56] doing dishes laundry tours around the
[6:57] house
[6:58] there's always room to put that in there
[7:00] somewhere just think about God while
[7:02] you're doing these mindless jobs we do
[7:04] sometimes they don't require a lot of
[7:07] mental activity so man Dennis exactly
[7:10] just to see the importance of meditation
[7:11] in order to see Jesus Christ working in
[7:13] your own life these are just a few of
[7:19] the things two things that I think of to
[7:21] meditate on there are many other things
[7:22] anything pertaining to the work and it
[7:24] is relevant anything pertaining to your
[7:26] journey I put I named a natural
[7:28] journeying spiritual journey anything
[7:30] pertaining to you know just life in
[7:32] general just a lot of things that we can
[7:34] meditate on see God in heaven and so on
[7:37] your natural journey trials and flip
[7:39] seems even infirmities these things
[7:41] aren't random you know the first example
[7:44] those book in the Bible we know is Joe
[7:45] and even in that early example the devil
[7:51] had to go get permission from God you
[7:52] can tell them you know take that hedge
[7:54] down so I can get a hold of Joe because
[7:57] God did a hedge around all of us and God
[7:59] you know
[7:59] can't touch us with in harmony or with
[8:01] anything until God so to motors that
[8:03] part out is going okay but don't touch
[8:05] his life so God is in control of all of
[8:07] it is your reasons and then how God
[8:11] brought you to where you are in natural
[8:12] life relationships the churches etc how
[8:15] did you get to this church how did you
[8:17] get to where you are spiritually and
[8:19] work all right now these natural trials
[8:26] of life you know our prime minister
[8:27] later about mine and Gaby's trial with I
[8:29] was the worst trial yet that I guess
[8:32] I've ever faced of our children almost
[8:33] dying it gives you confidence to know
[8:36] that God is with you one thing about him
[8:38] you come out the other side of that you
[8:39] think my lord you were there the whole
[8:41] time and next time you go there draw
[8:43] your life number two your spiritual
[8:51] journey how God has led you from the
[8:54] first time you heard the truth and it's
[8:56] absolute simplest form for me around
[9:00] 2011 when I was starting in the earliest
[9:02] earlier times of this meditation I
[9:04] learned he driving a truck thinking a
[9:06] lot about my journey and I started
[9:08] wondering about this aspect of my life
[9:10] this daily Bible reading a prayer where
[9:12] did I get that from because since I was
[9:14] fifteen I was reading the bow and
[9:15] praying every day in the Baptist Church
[9:16] and I still do that now in the message
[9:18] well it became a great blessing to me
[9:22] and I started wondering where if I
[9:23] picked that up there and looked down to
[9:25] the scope of my life and I remembered at
[9:26] four years old my grandma taught me to
[9:28] read the bow and pray okay well you
[9:30] can't say that that's not God working
[9:32] through a simple grandma to simply teach
[9:34] a little angry novella pray then 10 or
[9:37] 11 years later I've come back to that
[9:39] when I was older well who taught her to
[9:41] read about and pray her mom and so when
[9:44] I realized that best her mom is my
[9:46] great-grandma's EULA and Gabby's
[9:48] Kentucky granny
[9:50] so we named our third child EULA that
[9:52] was the time that that realization
[9:54] struck me in our and my journey was that
[9:57] even the simplest little thing of this
[9:59] simple little truth that I could have
[10:00] overlooked and thought it was random
[10:02] that just my grandma taught me to read
[10:04] the bone frame no that's a big thing
[10:05] there's God yeah how he continues to
[10:09] move you to progress forward even now to
[10:15] the fivefold ministry so forth now the
[10:18] scripture I'm gonna talk about slipping
[10:19] for it I'm going to name a few things
[10:20] about it maybe I won't agree with I
[10:23] might be wrong about it correct me if
[10:24] I'm wrong I don't know but few things I
[10:28] got to lay down as a background these
[10:29] are three verses just four examples
[10:31] three verses that have nothing in common
[10:34] they list items there are a list of
[10:37] things as a at a higher level I get sort
[10:41] of it up just briefly looking at it you
[10:43] might think that those are just several
[10:45] things to sort of stress the point maybe
[10:48] like they're not really necessary like
[10:50] it's several words just to say the same
[10:51] thing but it's not I believe every word
[10:53] of God is for purpose it's all in there
[10:57] for a reason and even the order the
[11:00] number of the words is significant so
[11:03] like for example every good gift and
[11:04] every perfect gift is from above and
[11:07] cometh down from the Father of lights
[11:08] which there was no variableness neither
[11:10] shadow of turning if you look up good
[11:12] and perfect it's not just saying the
[11:14] same thing good means usable and
[11:16] agreeable right God starts something
[11:19] good alright now he's gonna bring it to
[11:21] perfection it's what God does everything
[11:23] that starts it and then he finishes they
[11:25] say the perfect
[11:27] is maturing fullness completion then in
[11:30] Genesis he said when he created to bow
[11:34] says that the Lord looked and saw that
[11:35] everything was good
[11:36] I didn't say perfect if there's nothing
[11:38] wrong with it no flaws but it still had
[11:40] to go through a process there had to be
[11:42] a fall and redemption of man forgot be
[11:44] manifested in the garden and then back
[11:46] in and we get to the future home and to
[11:48] be perfect but everything God does is
[11:50] good at the start of it your new birth
[11:52] the start of your journey is good but
[11:54] you continue on to perfection so that's
[11:57] not random it's not haphazard those both
[12:00] those words are there for reasons and
[12:02] the scripture about Galatians about the
[12:04] through the spirit Galatians 5:4 the
[12:06] Spirit is love joy peace mystery
[12:09] long-suffering gentleness goodness
[12:11] finish three faith maintenance meekness
[12:14] temperance there's three against such
[12:17] there is no law and they that are
[12:18] Christ's have crucified the flesh with
[12:19] the affections and lusts there are three
[12:22] groups of three I don't know if the
[12:23] number nine is significant but I know
[12:25] three groups of three there are three
[12:27] that Scofield says these are more like
[12:29] your when they say pertaining to your
[12:34] basically your reflection toward an
[12:37] inward part
[12:43] your character as an inward state is
[12:46] loved or peace then he says the other
[12:49] part the second part long-suffering
[12:51] gentleness goodness is your character's
[12:53] expression for other people and then
[12:56] these are faith maintenance temperature
[12:58] characteristic expression for God but
[13:01] they're all there for reason and I don't
[13:03] know about as far as the order of them
[13:05] but I know these are in order this is
[13:07] good first and then perfect now we know
[13:10] second T no one is definitely there are
[13:12] eight clinics listed the number of those
[13:14] is significant eight for the bobster
[13:17] mentioned Winston I vote eight I think
[13:19] is a symbol of eternity continuation
[13:21] because they're seven days a week to go
[13:23] back they face back to the first day
[13:25] again without a starting point inflation
[13:27] eternity so what this is bringing to is
[13:30] something you've time in and the number
[13:32] of the missing in the order of Mister is
[13:35] significant because they all correspond
[13:38] to the churches so even though we Rome
[13:41] is significant these are not have
[13:42] mattered random things that's correct
[13:46] so with that in mind Philippians 4:8
[13:48] finally brethren whatsoever things are
[13:51] true whatsoever things are honest
[13:53] whatsoever things are just whatsoever
[13:54] things are pure whatsoever things are
[13:57] lovely but certain things are of good
[13:59] report if there be any virtue and if
[14:01] there be any praise think on these
[14:03] things
[14:10] and then the next first I say this this
[14:13] is what I'm saying I said this is
[14:15] talking about the new birth your journey
[14:16] from start to finish I'll break it down
[14:18] here in just a minute but just to
[14:21] underline that emphasize that the next
[14:23] verse Paul is saying those things which
[14:25] you have both learned and received and
[14:27] heard and seen in me a man that's born
[14:29] again those things do and the God of
[14:32] peace shall be with you if you follow me
[14:35] as I follow Christ okay so now all I did
[14:39] here put a number to each one that
[14:41] they're still in the order that they're
[14:43] on that verse my finally brethren what
[14:46] sort of things are there faith things
[14:47] that all go a is and represents eternity
[14:53] in mathematics it's it's the symbol of
[14:55] infinity a number that has no end and
[15:00] the literal number eight there's no
[15:02] starting point and ending point if you
[15:04] draw a nice name eight you can't tell
[15:06] where it starts and where it ends there
[15:09] are eight things the first one is truth
[15:10] well what's the first thing you have to
[15:12] come to in your journey I might really
[15:14] come to God you have to answer it well
[15:17] the four-year-old boy and the grandma
[15:18] say I've read about Craig she showed me
[15:20] that she actually got down with us as a
[15:22] 55 year old woman there about for Chris
[15:25] to me was really old and got down on her
[15:27] knees and pray and then the next thing
[15:32] if you are really sincere in that and
[15:35] you receive the truth and really believe
[15:36] it it will come you lead you to honesty
[15:40] so you're honest with God honest with
[15:42] yourself you begin to see because of
[15:43] that truth that you received when you
[15:45] first heard the message or when you
[15:46] first think I heard Jesus Christ died
[15:48] for your sins
[15:49] I'm before you came to justification you
[15:51] heard that Jesus died for your sin and
[15:54] your Center need salvation when that
[15:56] first really begins to strike in your
[15:58] heart it cause you to be honest dawn
[16:01] honest with yourself you begin to
[16:03] realize you're a sinner and you need
[16:04] salvation that goes beyond just pray on
[16:06] the sinner's prayer because in the
[16:09] Baptist Church many of my friends they
[16:10] were taught this eternal security you
[16:13] know they don't say he comes
[16:15] Karianna banister but what we're taught
[16:16] is all you have to do is pray this
[16:17] prayer no matter what to do the rest of
[16:19] your life you can't help me you just
[16:21] played the plug whatever you do you'll
[16:22] go to heaven when you die like some kind
[16:24] of mysterious potion you just pray that
[16:26] prayer you're good to rest your life I
[16:27] know a lot of people that believe that
[16:29] and then don't serve God but then
[16:31] looking back to prayer that phrase fifty
[16:32] years ago that they gave when there was
[16:35] a kid today so but if and then in the
[16:38] message there are people who believe
[16:39] that you come with a seed in you and I
[16:42] have to do is come a message if you came
[16:44] to the message you must be born again
[16:46] you must be right you must have that
[16:48] scene in you must be okay and a lot of
[16:50] churches that believe that you see
[16:52] people that read the Bible and pray that
[16:53] or see God they may come to church you
[16:55] know maybe not but that's not honesty
[16:58] when it come from real honesty you will
[17:00] come to justify but I did you will come
[17:02] to sanctification which is also where a
[17:04] lot of people stopped before I'm talking
[17:06] about number four here purity
[17:07] sanctification you will come to the
[17:10] number five which is the lovely the
[17:12] baptismal to spare the love of God shed
[17:13] abroad in your heart okay and that makes
[17:17] your life of good report before God
[17:19] because he's pleased with you if he is
[17:22] pleased with you in those other stages
[17:24] immunity he's accepted your sacrifice he
[17:26] will come and give you the Holy Ghost
[17:27] here accepting your sacrifice good life
[17:30] because it gave rapport you say that's
[17:32] my boy that's my girl
[17:33] and then you come to these virtues what
[17:36] you don't know is the stuff your perfect
[17:38] man I sent for many comic books to gain
[17:43] those godly virtues that's and then the
[17:45] capstone which is praise I think on
[17:49] these things it says if there be any
[17:51] virtue and if there be any praise think
[17:52] on these things so Paul is telling us to
[17:55] go through your whole journey think
[17:57] about where you've been spiritually
[17:58] unnaturally but especially on the
[18:00] spiritual side think about how God has
[18:02] led you and do this over
[18:04] and each time you come into more truths
[18:06] you come into being more honest you say
[18:08] you know Lord I really I'm still not
[18:10] where I need to be I want to hear more
[18:11] truth from both money today I want to
[18:13] hear something that maybe I didn't agree
[18:15] with that I'm wrong did I need
[18:18] correction in my mind and what I'm gonna
[18:20] leave in yeah and then that's when
[18:22] leaving to be honest again they're
[18:23] honest to come into justification a
[18:24] higher state of justification was a
[18:26] nation back from the Holy Ghost correct
[18:28] if anyone came to these virtues this is
[18:30] an unending journey as well your
[18:31] breathing you keep going through this
[18:33] that's right it never stops and then
[18:37] this is just to show you about the eight
[18:38] brother Brennan says next position seven
[18:40] Church age seven is completion eight is
[18:42] the first day again Jesus resurrection
[18:44] was the first fail with giving us
[18:46] eternal life in eternal Sabbath Sabbath
[18:51] high stature perfect man I'll just keep
[18:57] on that progressing seven a body has
[18:59] stopped preparing God dwells in the
[19:00] stature of a man reflecting himself into
[19:03] that in perfect worship that's what I
[19:05] was saying on that number that last one
[19:08] really stuff praise what more praise
[19:14] could there be godly worship in spirit
[19:16] and in truth there came any greater
[19:18] praise than pretty nominee well a many
[19:21] member body called a bride of Christ
[19:23] perfect worship God must being his
[19:25] tablet on manifest
[19:26] [Music]
[19:34] all right
[19:41] all right so these are just a few
[19:43] examples mostly in the Old Testament the
[19:46] word observed means to keep to guard
[19:48] observe give heed to watch for wait for
[19:50] it to watch and observe and so forth I'm
[19:53] just basically pertaining don't just let
[19:55] it go in one ear and out the other kind
[19:56] of chew on it that's move all the word
[19:59] God observe the sayings
[20:01] this is the y'all know the example in
[20:03] Genesis 37 Jacob and then you know the
[20:07] Joseph in his brother's dos was telling
[20:09] the dream and Jacob says shall I and my
[20:13] mother and my brethren indeed come to
[20:14] bow down ourselves to thee and to the
[20:16] earth and his brethren him be him but
[20:18] his father observed the same Luke - this
[20:22] is about Mary shepherds so much mother
[20:26] let us even now go to Bethlehem and see
[20:28] this thing was just going to pass which
[20:30] the LORD hath made known unto us and
[20:31] they came with haste and found Mary and
[20:33] Joseph and babe lying in a manger
[20:35] when they had seen it they made known
[20:36] abroad the saying which was told them
[20:38] concerning this child they have heard
[20:40] him under those things were told them by
[20:42] the shepherds but Mary kept these things
[20:44] and pondered them in her heart I'm Mary
[20:46] doing that a lot again
[20:49] where he's disputing the word with the
[20:50] straw the Pharisees how is it that you
[20:53] saw me wish you not that I must be my
[20:55] father's business and skip on that and
[20:57] said his mother kept these things in her
[20:59] heart right Mary's belief but a bantam
[21:02] said I think the reason we don't see no
[21:04] more of it than we do we've got our
[21:06] minds on too many other things I think
[21:08] the Angels would still appear to us if
[21:10] we only kept their minds upon them but
[21:13] we're thinking about something else
[21:14] that's true behold there was a man in
[21:18] Jerusalem others asleep - whose name was
[21:21] Simeon and he the same man was Justin
[21:24] devout waiting for the consolation of
[21:26] Israel Holy Ghost opponent okay he'll
[21:29] dammit
[21:29] should not see death we're seeing Lord's
[21:32] Christ somebody who had his mind on the
[21:35] Lord he was staying continually before
[21:36] the Lord same thing with Anna the
[21:38] prophetess daughter fangled of of the
[21:40] tribal base where she was of a great age
[21:42] at panel skip on now but she departed
[21:45] not from the temple but served God with
[21:47] fastings and prayers night and day look
[21:51] 11 are saying to you asking to show be
[21:53] given you seek and you shall find
[21:54] nothing shall be opening you for every
[21:57] one that asketh receiveth it seeketh
[21:58] findeth and to him that knocketh it
[22:01] shall be opened to state continually
[22:03] before the Lord meditation prayer
[22:04] fasting favor and so forth the greatest
[22:08] battle ever fought this is gonna be a
[22:09] long quote about three the greatest
[22:14] battle for when God came and man did a
[22:16] man in his hand sorry when God can get a
[22:19] man in his hand until they can get
[22:20] senses conscience everything cleaned out
[22:23] until it stands with God behind it and
[22:25] the spirit there's not a devil in the
[22:26] world can poke it down in there that's
[22:28] right he come around say you don't feel
[22:30] any better your conscience has even gone
[22:33] to that the flu is so clear it shall
[22:35] hallelujah that outlet blows a whistle
[22:37] glory to God it shines out certainly
[22:40] this is clean and clear for the word of
[22:42] God looks from the power of God that's
[22:44] the main thing yes
[22:46] there's your battle ground your battle
[22:47] ground is here at the beginning back
[22:49] soul back in your mind that opens the
[22:52] mind is the gate to the soul the gates
[22:54] of the Spirit rather your mind opens up
[22:56] and accepts the spirit or the spirit or
[22:58] rejection spirit you can have little
[23:01] consciousness and little feelings and
[23:02] those sensations all these things that
[23:04] has nothing to do with it that's just
[23:06] little sensational thing but when it
[23:08] comes to the reality your mind opens it
[23:10] up your mind either accept it or reject
[23:11] it that's it Frank God but none of them
[23:14] miss it see it's your mind that opens up
[23:18] the door or closes the door and listens
[23:19] to your countries listen to your memory
[23:21] your affection but when your mind closes
[23:24] itself to these things and let God the
[23:25] spirit of his work come in and blows the
[23:28] rest of the stuff out and every doubt is
[23:29] going every fear is gone every sensation
[23:30] that thought has gone every
[23:32] there's nothing standing there but the
[23:35] Word of God and say you cannot go
[23:36] against down song my team let the words
[23:42] of my mouth and the meditation of my
[23:44] heart be acceptable my sight O Lord my
[23:46] strength my Redeemer
[23:47] so I'm 100 for a meditation of him
[23:50] she'll be sweet I will be glad in the
[23:53] Lord
[23:53] some 119 verse 97 oh how we love them
[23:58] how I love that law it is my meditation
[23:59] all today and verse 99 I have more
[24:02] understanding than all my teachers for
[24:04] by testimonies all my meditation here
[24:08] you can brother banner says and also
[24:10] that you might tell the people will be
[24:12] instructed to know how to tell them to
[24:13] receive their healing and how to wait
[24:15] and walk to the Lord as you meditate
[24:16] upon that it takes meditation on the
[24:19] Lord arranging into your presence that's
[24:21] right always while we think on these
[24:23] things Christ appears blind Bartimaeus
[24:26] us think about God bus if there be any
[24:29] praise the pre-emerge you think on these
[24:30] things our mind strolls off the first
[24:33] thing you know we've strayed out there
[24:35] somewhere we're thinking about something
[24:36] else
[24:37] let's keep Jesus on my heart on my mind
[24:39] all the day day and night that's the way
[24:42] that's not all folks that trial without
[24:49] several years ago 2014 we didn't realize
[24:54] while that was going on all the things
[24:56] God was doing there and during the time
[24:58] that I was preparing after she had
[25:00] already started coming back and started
[25:02] reviving sort of getting better I was
[25:04] preparing to give a testimony it started
[25:06] out so simple I was just going to say
[25:08] thank the Lord for healing our baby she
[25:09] nearly died but she's better thank you
[25:11] for a couple minutes testimony and as I
[25:14] kept practicing and practicing and
[25:15] thinking on it I begin to see
[25:17] more and more I'm done with work and
[25:19] that's where I testified if you hear the
[25:20] tape about the three messengers or
[25:22] witnesses Friday a scripture came to my
[25:25] mind thought that was totally random
[25:26] just me
[25:27] they arrest for me Saturday by the late
[25:29] spoke to me at the bow of study and said
[25:31] don't fear don't worry and then Sunday
[25:33] morning two o'clock in the morning I
[25:35] didn't go looking for that verse that
[25:37] was in my daily program my daily it was
[25:39] on the menu that baby for me to read
[25:41] first John for if it has torment and I
[25:44] stopped looked over gabbing applying to
[25:46] her and I explained to her the three
[25:47] witnesses now that I was realizing and
[25:49] from that time on I began to see God in
[25:51] the whole trial I'm sure the fans you
[25:53] what tell me that she was gonna get
[25:55] better he's tell me I'm fair that's all
[25:57] he was saying yeah that's right but
[25:59] because I was meditating on that later
[26:00] on I saw everything so when you have
[26:02] trials and everything you often a lot
[26:04] think on these things
