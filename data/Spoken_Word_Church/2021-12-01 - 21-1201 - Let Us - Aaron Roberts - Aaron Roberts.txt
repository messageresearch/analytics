watching later lord i just pray that you'll be with them bless them in a special way tonight and father we just commit all things to you in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen hebrews chapter 8 and verse 1. it says now the things which we have spoken this is the sum we have such a high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in heaven a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the lord pitched and not man for every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices wherefore it is of necessity that this man have some what also to offer for if he were on earth he should not be a priest seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law who therefore unto the example and shadow of heavenly things as moses was admonished of god when he was about to make the tabernacle for see saith he that thou make all things according to the pattern shown to thee in the mount but now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry but how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant which was established upon better promises for if that first covenant had been faultless then should no place have been sought for the second for finding fault with them he saith behold the day come the days come saith the lord when i will make a new covenant with the house of israel with the house of judah not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers and the day when i took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of egypt because they continued not in my covenant and i regarded them not saith the lord for this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord i will put my laws in their mind and write them in their hearts and i will be to them a god and they shall be to me a people amen and then we're going to just flip over and read hebrews chapter 4 and just a few scriptures here beginning of verse 11 and it says let us labor therefore to enter into the rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and as a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart neither is there any creature that is not made manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession for we have not we have not and high priest which cannot be touched with a feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin let us let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in the time of need amen god bless you may be seated is that better is that better we're good okay so uh i'm entitled this let us and the subtitle was a royal priesthood but uh you know paul says there's many scriptures in in in the scripture that paul writes and and he says let us let us and that's what what caught my attention was he was speaking about a royal priesthood but he begins to speak about christ coming and how christ was a high priest and how he said you know when moses had everything in the in the wilderness and the tabernacle set up and had the priesthood and how the priesthood started and all those things but christ was a greater high priest than than what aaron was and all the things that they had done and all the things that had had went through being as a high priest and we know that you know that was a uh just for a time that they would be a high priest or a priesthood but there was an eternal priesthood and and the scripture tell paul tells us that he said and ye are in holy priesthood amen and he said and he says that that we are a royal priesthood and so the the scripture tells us who we are and they're in uh first peter chapter 2 and verse 5 and it says ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold i lay in zion a chief cornerstone elect precious that he that believeth on him shall not be confound unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient whereunto also they were appointed he said but you're a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light and so i was just looking at this and and and you know we see how the things that were in the in the old testament and the uh the aaronic priesthood and and all the things but you know god had an order and it had said everything in order and god had had brought the things and he called moses up into the mountain and he showed a vision and told him said set everything in order and there was an order to that but yet that was that was something that was going to pass away there was only a limited time in which this would take place but you know he said it but he had one which is speaking of christ coming and christ was a greater high priest than what aaron had but it was a divine order but there was a divine order with what christ and he was a greater high priest that came and it had a and he said it had a better covenant with better promises and so you know we look at the at the old testament at what god had done for them in the old testament and even and we began to look at what god had given them and commanded them and shown them and you know god was not well god was always faithful in the whole journey of the children of israel and everything that they went through and everything that moses had went through all the problems and all the trials and everything he was he was he was perfect and he was faithful in what he had called them to but but the children of israel they were the ones that didn't follow what god wanted them to do but you know it was it was them continuing to have not have faith in what he had called them to believe and he began to show them you know there and you know when abraham had had went into the into egypt there and you know and they had went in and you know he said that you're that your descendants would would sojourn in a strange land there and you know uh joseph had went in and you know and all the things that had taken place but you know he said listen you're only going to be here for a short time but it's it's a time that you're going to have to come out because god god won't bless them outside of the place that god had called them to he couldn't bless them in egypt now they were blessed for a while there but they couldn't stay there because that was not what god had called them to and you know many times in our lives god has called us and we've been blessed by things but you know what god has called us to a greater a greater place a greater higher plane than what we are today but god is wanting us to move on and you know you cannot be blessed where you are today because you can you're going to be either worse or better than off of where you are today we leave this service tonight we'll only be better or we'll be worse but we but we've been called to a place to be higher and and to draw closer to god and receive the benefits in which he's given us because you know he is our high priest and you know in the old testament as it said the old testament you know they were they were there to intercede for the people right and so you know and and one of the things that that that struck me is you know when when we began to speak of the of the royal the priesthood and how you know god god called aaron and his sons and and told them these are these are going to be my people they're going to be sanctified unto me and they're going to do my work and that you would the children of israel would bring their gifts to them but you know and all the things that you see that that they begin to do the things that they set up and you know and you see in the in the tabernacle as as they begin to be set up and everything and then later on as as they begin in their journey and as as they came into the land of promise we know that when they when they came in that god told aaron and and moses to to gather up the manna and put it in the in the r and the in the holy of holies there would put up the owners and that those men that served in the office of the of the priesthood then when they were called to come into that place they were brought into the into the presence of god and was given the manna that had been saved and so they've been tasted of that heavenly man of the heavenly gift and here they are begin to to feed on that and so you know when when they begin to serve outside of outside to serve the people and they begin to serve these things and follow the ordinances of god you know they had an experience to tell people about because they had actually stood in the presence of god and not only did they just think and hear about the manna that failed and the miracles that took place but they actually got to eat that manna they had actually tasted of that manna and then when they began to stand up there and you know no doubt when they stood out there and they were offering the sacrifices and doing doing the work of god yeah there was something that held them because those men as they stood there they were sending one because they had been in the presence of god they had and it wasn't it wasn't just that we were just following the word we were just following a plan we're just following what what the letter of the word but that was an experience that had taken place in them that when they began to walk out there no doubt some of them could see that you know they they did not just do this as a job but they also saw this as a sacrifice this was worship unto jehovah this was what they done for god and so it meant something more than just you know just doing a duty or or something like that but it was something that they realized this was my uh part that i give to god this is this is my sacrifice given to god so i'm doing my part and you know not only is it just you know we're just going through a ritual but no but they see that this this is honoring god amen and so is today you know many times we we felt that when we come to church or do different things you know sometimes we we fail to see the significance of it and we fail to see that you know we're worshiping god and the things that we do every in our lives is is to be an as as romans 12 tells us that you know our lives are supposed to be a living sacrifice acceptable unto god which is our reasonable service so these things that we do we can do just you know we can just get wrapped up sometimes in just living life and not realizing you know we are a royal priesthood a chosen generation to show forth the praises of god so we can we can sometimes just get lost in those things and not realize who we are the things that you are you and i are called to do so those those priests as they begin to do these things you know and you know then it's just as time went on you know it began to they the people began to lose the uh sincerity of it the sacredness of it was gone right even even when we began to read in the scripture even the priest began to walk away from that and it did it didn't have the sacredness it didn't it didn't have there was no sincerity in it anymore it became to be more of a ritual we're just going through the motions but you know all those things god god wrote all those things to pass but that was just that was a a covenant that was to pass away but there was one that came that was to be a greater a greater high priest that brought a greater covenant and so as we see he came and then you know he said he said because paul's speaking here and he's you know he's speaking to the to the hebrews and you know they the the jews had a you know they had an understanding of the old testament and all the types and everything so you know he goes back to the old testament he brings these things out and he's speaking of the law because you know here's these the things that they see in the word and he's like well you know if if that covenant had been had been what god ultimately desired he said we'd have stayed with it but he said he said you know all these things came that would be a to pass away but it was a type of one that was coming christ that had a greater covenant to the people and now we've been able to enter in that we have greater promises than those in the old testament had that he did he began because you know as as they took their sacrifices and offered them you know as the scripture tells us you know that that's not what god ultimately desired i mean because you know they because the scripture tells us you know that's what god required of the people but that's not what he ultimately desired because in in hebrews when he's speaking paul's speaking in hebrews again in chapter 10 he says wherefore when he cometh into the world he says sacrifice and offerings thou would has not but a body thou hast prepared me he said in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will o god above when he said sacrifice and offerings and burnt offerings and offerings for sin thou would has not neither has pleasure therein which are offered by the law then said he lo i come to do thy will oh god he taketh away the first that he may establish the second by by the which we are sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all i the brothers want to find it it's at the end it's all the way to the end brother of the notes if they want to bring that up and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering often times the same sacrifices which can never take away sins but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for friend for sins forever sat down on the right hand of god from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool whereof the holy ghost also is a witness to us after for after that he said before this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days saith the lord i will put my laws in their hearts and in their minds will i write them and their sins and iniquities i will remember no more now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiness the holiest of the blood of jesus by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil which is to say his flesh and having an high priest over the house of god let us draw near with a true heart and full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of faith of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised so when we begin to speak of him being the faithful and bringing in a better um covenant see when when the old one passed away then he wanted to bring in a new covenant and he and he come in and he said he was not he was even though he all were required those that was not what he all ultimately wanted but there was one that would come that would fulfill the law that would fulfill the the fullness of the word because as as all of the sacrifices that were offered even even when when you go back and you look about all of the uh sacrifices that solomon offered when when they built the temple and and all the things you think about all of the the thousands of animals that were sacrificing you know and none of that done even though god accepted that worship that was not what god ultimately wanted and and that and then all of all of the animals that were sacrificed never took away that desire it never took away their sin it never fulfilled the law and it never fulfilled the requirement that god had and so and all those things that you know yeah they done what god wanted them to and then it covered them but it wasn't what but god had had a sacrifice that would come that would ultimately fulfill the law and it came and he and so he came as a sacrifice but he was also the high priest that had to come because he had to fulfill the covenant and by him coming and being the sacrifice because he became become the one that would fulfill the law then he become the mediator of that covenant when he become the mediator then he became they took on the role of being the high priest because he become the harvard one because he could intercede in that because he become the mediator of that new covenant that he was the high priest in which that could fulfill the law then then when you and i were able then he could be in our high priest then we had a way to have access into that way into that place because he stepped because he became our high priest and became our intercessor then through him made a way for us to come in then when then when paul tells them he said then come boldly before the throne of grace why because it's been a way that's been made for you the way has the access has been made then you and i we can come boldly that we can we can take and step into that place and we can hold fast to our profession why because he's made the way because the way you know his brother madam said so many times you know he said if he was standing here tonight standing here he said he couldn't heal you he couldn't save you he couldn't do anything for you why because it's already done so when he's already made the way in then who has to have the access then who has to come in then he said it's you and i have to make our way in because the way has been made for us that we have we've had access into his presence so the invitation is ours and so you you see in the in the old testament with the with the priesthood and the way that you know there was a intercession that was made and they had uh covenants that were made that and i was thinking of uh when the in the old testament when god gave the the law you know he he told them that there was a uh there had to be uh he set up cities of refuge and you know when he made those cities of refuge then he had access to those things he said if a man killed somebody unaware he said he said there was a place that they could run to that was to get away from the avenger of blood he said the access was made for them he said that they could run in and plead their case and he said and they were covered and there was a place for them to come into and so the scripture tells us that when they played their case before the uh before the uh the rulers as they made their case and then they they called and said well you have you you've been covered you have access into the city and that you're covered and the avenger of blood can't come and get you as long as you stay fortified here there there's a place for you to stand and come in and you let off the pressure then you then you're saving their safety here but the scripture tells it you know the scripture tells us that they didn't have to stay there forever many you know because there's a time that the scripture tells us that as long as that high priest that was in the it was in the office at that time he said as long as that high priest was there he said that person had to stay in the city and they were covered he said but until the death of the high priest he said then the man was free to go so then what was it he was the high priest that was doing intercessing for him he was his intercessor so as long as the high priest was there he had intercession but when the intercession finished then he could go free and so you know we see we talk about we've we've entered into this this uh place of refuge that paul talks about you know that we have entered in that god made a way that we can come in and we have access into this but you know there's a thing is when there is a time coming and we realize that today that god is still on the throne he is still our intercessor to the world but you know there's a day coming that you know what his intercessor or your work will be done brother bram said the mediatorial work will be finished and when that time is finished then you know what there isn't there is no more mercy there isn't there is no more covering for the world he said but as long as he's still laying there he said yes there is still blood there still is covering for the people are still covering for your sin there's still forgiveness but there's coming a day when that's not going to take place anymore but you know what it's telling us that when that's what that's what it's waiting that there's a time that the bride will be here but when that finishes then you know what we're going home because you know what that's going to be our ultimate freedom one because there's not going to be any more work that he's going to be doing and so he's you know not only is he waiting on us but he's still doing that work because there's still people that have to come in people have to come to that place but when that finishes then you know what then we're going to rapture just as just as that man who said in that city of refuge and he had refuge the whole time and he was safe and secure in that but you know what when the high priest finished his intercessory work that he was able he was free to go there was nothing remembered more no more in his past that what had taken place in the past had been forgotten none of the things that were remembered anymore and he walked out a free man and you know he could walk he could walk in the midst of all of the of the avengers that came and stood there and he said none of y'all can touch me why because i'm free it's and it's the same way with us because you know we know we know that satan is the accuser of of the brethren and we know we know he comes to attack us and he's he goes through like a as a roaring lion and you know they come and you know come and try to attack us but you know what there's coming you know because if we've entered into this into this realm of safety into this place of refuge that we can do we can be free then you know what there no there's nothing that's going to attack us they can't get to us unless god allows it but there's coming a day you know what then all the former things will be passed away you know we're coming to a day that we'll not have to see all these things anymore as moses told the children of israel he said this enemy that you see today he said you'll see no more and see all of the enemies that we see today all the things that we have to face in this life all the problems that we see in this world that are that are coming against us and all the battles that we have to face you know what we're not going to see them anymore there's coming a time why because we are going to be free we're going to be free from all these things what a wonderful thing that we have that we have that we have a high priest to intercede for our on our behalf he said we have we have a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities we we have one that can that can reach to us that we can reach out to that he understands what it's like to be a human amen he understands all the the strengths and the problems and the failures that we go through why because he went through him also he came he came in flesh and and and lived and battled all this all the things that we battle as a human all the things that we've been through in our lives all the things that we've had to fight all the failures all the confusion but he's got the answer for it he's he's carried all the way through he knows he's made a way why because he's our intercessor and see he's he's and he's everything to us he's everything this is this is from the message jehovah of miracles it's 1959. and i i love this and brother brahms praying he says oh father god send forth your blessings upon your people anoint the people send the holy ghost in great power and great measure of grace and love granted lord hear our prayers we praise you we love you we raise our hands to you we lift our hearts to you you are our life our soul our being our food our water your our life our sight all that we are we live and breathe by you lord oh take us lord mold us fascists take us away from the world oh god put your spirit in us you said you are a peculiar people a holy a royal priesthood a spiritual priesthood offering spiritual gifts the fruit of our lips giving praise to god that's what we're doing right now lord giving praise to our god making a sacrifice throwing up our lips our praise and saying we love you lord we don't care what anyone says we love you you're our god your savior our healer you're our king you're our salvation you're our life you're all that we are lord you're all that to us and we thank you for it i don't know about y'all but that that stirs me up because you know he's he's everything to you he's he's he's everything why because he's he's made everything for you and i just love that when when brother brown was praying he said lord you know because we we have been made to be a spiritual a royal priesthood that's peculiar people that you've made us and he said you may you've given us everything he said everything that we have of need of every every aspect of our lives it's you lord there's there's no aspect that you don't have a part of and he said lord take us and mold us and and make us into what we ought to be to give it and and and to understand that we that we understand that he is he is our high priest but he's called us to be a priesthood also he's called us into a priesthood a royal priesthood and you know the and when you begin to look at these things is you know when when you see the the what god has has done you know what god has done for us amen you know that is what we are to proclaim to the world you know it it i hope i hope i can get this out but you know i you you see what god has given you and you there's a way that god i was i was listening to brother branham the other day and he was talking about he was talking about a housewife or whatever you know he said you know she she's so backwards sometimes she wouldn't she wouldn't answer the door somebody come to the door like so backwards he said but let him get full of the holy ghost he said you know what you can't keep it bottled up why because i got to share it with somebody you know because there's something on the inside that you've got to share there's there's something that's on the inside that's got to come out and so you know if god if god is our high priest and he's and he's brought us to this place and he's brought us into this spiritual this spiritual priesthood then you know what he's made us just like we are we're just like him that we are that we are a priesthood and in the scriptures paul was talking about that he came and you know every priest every priest offers sacrifices amen and and is in his intercessor and so when he's speaking here of him being being the high priest and us entering into this priesthood then god god has called us to a job also god has called us to a place also for us to do something you know not because you know the priesthood the priesthood was a servant to the people you know the priest is not just something that you're that you're in some kind of clique or you're in some kind of uh secret society or you're in some some kind of club or you know you've got you've got this special right or or something like that that has nothing to do with that but god has called us to to be to show forth the praises of god for us to do these things and so when we saw what what jesus come to do jesus became became he as the scripture tells us that that he that he had you know had no form he had no comeliness you know he had no reputation of his own but he come to do exactly what the father had him to do he was it was nothing of himself but he come he said he said whatever you know the son can do nothing of himself except what he saith the father do that do with the son likewise so you know he just come to do the father's will he said not not my will lord but thine be done and so when he began to do these things that what is it that you and i are to be doing is the exact same thing to to be i believe it was brother wade was talking about you know you know we sing the song and we sing the song about uh wanting to be like jesus to be like jesus but you know do we actually take and sit down and take the full account of what that actually entails what does that mean to us to be like jesus because many times you know we it's it's easy to to to do our own try to do our own thing or or you know because you know we're just we're just humans and we we get it wrapped up in and you know just human ideas and human thoughts and we think we can do it and you know the the devil likes to talk to you and put it in your mind and you know we've we we get wrapped up in those things and it's like you know it's it's not that that we try to do anything but it's to do what god wants us to do it's to be led of the spirit to do what god wants us to do but you know and and to understand that to be it to be an intercessor to be a high priest and that's one of the things i want to look at because you know when you see what what has god called you to do what what has god called you to do because you know the world is not going to see jesus christ except in you and i because you know the world is the world is looking for something that's real the world is looking for an answer that's that's that is it goes contrary to what the world talks about today why because the world is so full of people trying to find something that's real people will go out in there all the time digging and searching and trying to find truth and they can't find it you know there's so many people you know they they've spent all of their time and then and uh i was i was reading a thing the other day and they were talking about a man that you know he kept he had money and had fame and and he had all these things but you know he wanted to do he wanted to find something that he could do that would honor god you know to help people and uh and so you know without getting into a whole lot but it was just it was just amazing how you know he had a desire to do something that was that was beyond just just doing because you know he and the man was uh danny thomas you know and you know he had a great desire to help people you know what can i do he's like i've got money i got popularity i've got all these things but he said what but that's not that didn't fulfill me and you know he kept he kept he prayed and he's like you know what can i do that can help somebody and you know and all and all these things it was just it kind of struck me you know because you know people people have found they have found fame and fortune and all these things and but you know what that's emptiness there's nothing there but you know when he when he decided you know he said you know he's you know he was praying and you know something and began to deal with him about starting satan jude's hospital you know but you know you know he began to do something why because it was something and i thank god because you know you know god's works in hospitals and and doctors and thank god for them and all that but you know it's something that you know because god you know i believe god laid something on that man's heart for him to do that but it wasn't it was not just all fame and fortune and all these things and you know people chasing a pot of gold and all these things that's not going to be any fulfillment because you know the man that came to brother branham and you know he said i kept trying to find god and he said well you know if i when i got my ba degree he said i thought i'd have it and he said then i went went to got another degree and he said i got degrees and plastered the wall he said but i'm not even closer to god he said i went to this denomination they told me try this do this do this do this he said he's i haven't found any i've ever gone in any of it he said i've not been satisfied in any of it and he said what is it he said when you come and re it's it's finding god not just a bunch of rules and regulations not just not just imagination but when you find him find god that's right see then the brother began to point him back to the word and see this is where you look why because organizations it's like well you know you you can't know god until you got a t go to college no you need to get down on your knees you need to get an altar and pray through until you find him why because he's not found in a book well because there's many people that have that are intellectually i mean intellectually smart but i mean but devoid of the spirit one because they've they've read they've read the books they know the bible backwards and forth and even people that's read this message they've read every single book they can quote it tell you backwards and forwards and argue about it and not have not have one no one iota of the spirit of god dwelling in them why because that it's not by learning but it's by yielding yourself to the spirit and praying through and letting god lead you it's because he's going to lead you through it's not you trying to find it you know everybody's trying to find rapturing faith well for our afternoon faith lays in the books and the tapes but it's not trying to find a certain message that brother branham preached but it's finding him in the message just like brother branham said he said if you hadn't found christ in every verse then go back and read it again because you've missed it and that's what it is it's it's him in the scripture because he said hello i come in the volume of it so it's not him trying to find one little we got to find one little word we got to find one little phrase one little scripture no it's finally taking all of it it's all that's there all of it in the scripture and then you can find it because you know there's many people that you know they they like their certain quotes and but where is it when you when you take that when you only take certain parts of the word and you read certain quotes but you don't but you look at other parts of the message and it's like when brother branham preached it was it was it just brother random preaching does to be preaching or was there a word there that had to be preached for the people to understand so when people when people don't take the word and actually get into it and say well lord i don't understand this well we're not going to touch that well see that's the problem is is when you get to the places where where the devil can put up scarecrows and you're not going to get into that part of the world then how are you going to find god how are you going to find the fullness of the word when you don't even get into the fullness of the word amen anyway you know many people you know as as many times as by the way different ones brother dale's talked about you know people don't people don't even own you know the 70 weeks of daniel book never read the book how you know how in the world people people have never read the seal book they've never read the church age book and so if you've never read those things how are you going to how is the holy spirit going to lead you into truth to understand these things and people people will not stand up and just stand up and just raise our hands and say listen i don't understand yeah you know people people want to hide behind something and not realize just be real just be honest people people just don't want to be honest with god and stand before god and say listen i'm not where i ought to be you know people people just get up and say listen you know because do you really have the holy ghost do you know who jesus do you really have the indwelling or do you just live under an anointing and just stand up and say lord i don't know why because now's the time now is not the time to be relaxed or wishy-washy or think you got it when you don't but now's the time to be honest and forthright with god and stand up and say lord i don't know if i've got it or not amen we need we need to come to a place where people have droven down a stake when they when they lay down that mark and know that they know that they know that these things are true to know who they are why because this is a late hour we don't know but you know let me tell you what it's not going to be forever and it's going to be very soon but you know you better have you better have your uh papers in order you better have your seal you better be set to go because when it when it comes then you can say well i thought i had it as the scripture tells us they say lord then we preach and we prophesy lord he didn't do mighty wonderful works in your name that's all those things didn't matter didn't amount to anything why because if you hadn't received him that's what that's what really counts have you received the holy ghost since you believed have you received him do you know who what the holy ghost is do we that we need to know these things and it is in its big and it's uh it's beco on us it it behooves us it is it is our commission our uh commandment to make sure that people know these things to stand up and to be the ones that call it and say listen these are the things that you know that you should know to understand these are the things that you need to make sure that you have the holy ghost not just not just some man-made idea or what you think or some sensation but to actually know who jesus christ is when people when people don't even believe that you have to have justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost to be born again well people don't even understand what what brother branham said about the new birth there's a lot of people that have sympathized with it and a lot of people mentally agree with it but the thing is is they've not actually come to a place where they've actually been settled in the word that they've actually had a born-again experience and when and so now it's a time that people need to know these things and it's you and it's you and i our job to make sure that people know that you know you know only god can do the work but you know it's as you and i we have to be as if god has called us to be the priesthood to be the ones that we've got to do the ones that are that are interceding for people to make sure that they know god has called us to that to hold to hold the standard to hold the truth to let people know see god has called us to be an enter to be a priesthood to be and to be intercessors not only to offer the sacrifices to god but to be an intercessor and you know i i think of so many that you know that that when you have to you know share with people you know you have to live the life you know everything to everything that we do everything that we say ought to be ought to be living the life before people you know to to you know to because you never know what what your what words you're going to what position that you're going to be in to be the one to reach somebody that's right you know many times people people they they they look at things as being so insignificant but you know many times people don't realize the the uh it takes it it only takes you know the one significant moment in people's lives that many times people look as as uninsignificant but that is that that meant something to somebody yeah i i was thinking about dwight moody there and that lady you know god laid it upon her heart to rent out that livery stable or whatever and you know she got it all set and had an evangelist come and she was going to have a meeting and nobody shows up but you know some some dirty stringy head little boy comes into that meeting and in that in that meeting that man preaching the word to him catches it and god calls him and and he receives christ that night and becomes saved now everybody else like why did she waste her time there's an insignificant about you know what really took place there but brother ram said see nobody sees on the other side what was taking place there that that that that woman following the leading of the holy ghost to do that led dwight moody to christ and then he was able to lead a million souls to the lord and you know what she is she is honored and she is credited with that because she done that but it looks so insignificant to people but they didn't realize that that in this in that moment that was god reaching the world absolutely and many people you know they you know what what is it you know we see things in our lives and and we think well that you know it's it's insignificant or in it you know it doesn't really amount to anything and many times we look at things in our lives and we're trying to uh find significance or things you know what are we actually doing are we actually trying to reach out and touch somebody are we actually doing what god wants us to do you know i was i was i was thinking about brother uh andrew glover when he was here and you know he was talking about being in india that time and you know he's he said there and you know he was there they're preaching and and the spirit of the lord's moving and then he had the the ministers were on the platform that time and you know he just turned to him and said preach the gospel just preach he said no matter if you're just in your house or you know if it looks insignificant he said just preach the gospel you know do it he said it because it's for god and you know he just kept exhorting the preachers and he said when the meeting was over he said this brother came up to him and you know he come up and hugged him and he said he said you know he said i didn't understand their language and they didn't understand mine but they had to have interpreters but that man come up to brother andrew and told him he said he said i was about ready to give up he said i was about ready to give up he said you know we i've been pastoring a little little work and you know i guess nothing was going on and i guess he was meeting in his house or whatever and all these things and it was just so insignificant that he thought he didn't mean anything but you know what it meant something to god whatever he was doing there was some kind of work that was taking place that he couldn't see but it was something that that when he was so discouraged that brother andrew was able to give him the word of encouragement keep going brother keep going keep going because god has a work for you to do whatever it is when because you know so we we don't always see what god has in store but we know that god has called us to these things whatever it is god has called us to do it you know brother branham said one time he said you know god has called us to do these things and he said all he wants us to do is make an effort to make an effort you know many people they want to sit back and and you know they want to wonder if you know should i do this or should i do that he said well check it by the word you know people you know they you know they're so afraid of doing things that you know and it's so but check it by the word if god's called you to do something you know you're never going to be happy until you do it you know what you're never going to be in the place that you never be fulfilled you never be in the right place until god till you do what god has for you to do he's called you to do something then you do it how many people you know they struggle and wonder well what should i or should i not or these things and you know they allow the devil to beat on them you know and you know you think about well you know there was peter that day standing in the boat and you know everybody else was afraid of what was going to take place in the storm and all these things but you know what jesus came walking on the sea became walking in the storm that day and there he was standing and you know when all of them were they were the scriptures said they were afraid and they thought it was a ghost and all that but you know what peter said lord if that be you then bid me to come and he said come now what kind of person in their right mind is going to step out a perfectly good boat in the middle of a storm it ain't this fella i was born at night but it wasn't last night but you know i you know but you know what there was something inside of peter that rose up that you know that that activated his faith that he said the lord he said if that means if that be you bid me to come and he said come well you know here's here's this man perfectly you think he was perfectly normal i don't know how normal he was but you know he just stepped over that edge one because he had confidence in who that was and now he knew and he had confidence in who that was that he stepped right out of that boat and began to walk on the water but you know what as long as he had his eyes on jesus you know what he could walk on the water because that's exactly what god called him to do jesus told him come that he could that he could do the impossible but god called him to do that that he could walk out there and do that he could walk in the water but until he got his eyes off of god off of jesus then he began to sink and you know jesus jesus said well peter why did you doubt you were doing good you wanted to do this and you know what i led you i called you and you know what you're walking but what did you doubt and if god has called you to do something then you know we need we need to narrow i mean we need to nail it down you know if god you know because people well i don't know if i should do this or that or but you know what if check it by the word that's right and then brother i said check it by the word and if it's worth the word then do it to go with it say lord i'm i'm going to do this by by your faith you know peter's standing there in the boat and and jesus begins to speak to him that day and he's like what have you called anything no no we fished all night got nothing he's like well just cast your net on the other side and peter's there and said lord i was born on the sea i grew up out here that's all i've ever done my entire life is fish and i know that there's no fish in here we've been doing it all night i've been doing it all my life i know but he said that thy word lord i'm gonna throw the net in and you know what they almost they almost lost the nets because they were trying to pull in all the fish and many times we get the same thing well lord i know this ain't going to change lord we've been around this mountain over and over lord we've done these things and you know what ain't nothing changed but you know what you keep doing it amen because you know what at thy word lord i'm going to do it when everything goes wrong he said do it anyhow just keep doing it just follow the word just do what god tells you to do so many times because when when god has called you to do something then do it and don't and don't get wrapped up on the things that you see in the things that you don't see if god has called us to to be a priesthood a royal priest a peculiar people then if we're called to do these things then you know what we do things that people don't understand but you know what if god has called us to do these things to be a royal priesthood then you know what we stand up and we claim our families we claim our loved ones and it doesn't matter how things fall apart you know what but at thy word lord i'm going to continue to do it when everything falls apart but thy word lord i'm still going to do it why because i'm not going to look at the things that i see but i'm going to look at the word because this is where i'm going to stand god has called us to do something so that's what god wants us to do you know many times people trying to you know i was i was listening to this this man he's a i forgot what his name is but he's a international soccer star he's made all this money and everything but you know his dad put something in him about playing soccer and you know that's all he wanted to do you know he said dad listen one of these days he said he said we're going to have all this money we'll have all these things all these great things in this world but you know his dad told him he said he said we'll not have them but he said i want you to go after your dreams i'm gonna instill in it to you to go after your dreams i want you to fulfill your dreams and you know that's that's what he does and he said today he said all the things that my dad and i talked about those days when we were we were poor we were in poverty and all the things that we had to face and all the things we all the struggles we went through he said i've got everything that i wanted he said but i don't have my dad he said why because he said i didn't understand what dad was trying to tell me but dad kept telling me he said listen go after your dreams but he said you won't have we won't share them he said i don't understand but he said no i see that dad was trying to tell me he said go after him because you know i may not be here and you know we see things and and what struck me about that is you know as parents our our obligation is not just to feed and clothe them and educate them but we ought to get them so full of the holy ghost it's our job to to apply the token it's our it's our job to fill them full of the word her job is instilling them the values and the word of god so that god can do a work in their lives well it's our job to show them what a what a true overcoming life is all right that's our job well you know people people want to you know you you can try to educate them and and have them in all kinds of sports and activities and all kind of things like that no well and there's nothing wrong with any of those things but if we're not instilled in them the love of god if we're not instilled in the word of god then all of the rest of it is moot then you know there's nothing to any of that then when you share with them and under to be the ones that stand there and hold a standard before our children that they know what right and wrong is the scripture tells us he said to train up a child in the way it should go he said and when they're old he said they won't depart from it well then you know what then we can stand firm on that why because god give us our children and you know what and it and so they're the heritage of god and you know what the devil can't put his hands on them why because that's our job to stand there and do that you know and there's so many times i was thinking about today that you know there's people you know just like my grandmother and different ones you know they didn't they never got to see you know i mean you think about all the times you know i i was out in the world and doing all kinds of stuff but i knew there was one thing grandma was praying for me and she was only a phone call away but you know what she never got to see any of those things you know she prayed for her children she prayed for her grandchildren but you know what she never got to see any of those things but you know what god never forgot any of her prayers you know god never forgot any of the faith that she had that she claimed us that she believed that stood that stood for us when we were out in the world we had nobody but somebody was standing for us they interceded for us and brothers and sisters it's our job to intercede for them to stand up and claim claim what god has given us our god-given rights as a royal seat of abraham when when lot was taken by the by the kings and they were hauled off you know abraham didn't stand there and say oh what we going to do well lord what we going to do there are 6 kings down there and there's only 318 of us well he didn't get he didn't get worried he didn't get concerned about it why because he knew who he was he had he had confidence in who god was and who he was and his relationship with god and he said you know what he said that's my brother and he said you know what i'm going after him i'm not i'm not backing up i'm not going to be concerned am i going to be worried why because god's in control and his brothers and sisters it knows those that have fallen and whatever it is it says the scripture tells us it's our job to restore them not to browbeat them and you know and and rebuke them and everything like that but it's to go after them we do that in a in a spirit of love in the spirit of christ those that have walked away those that have backslid whatever you know what we still claim them as long as they've got breath in their body then god can do something for them i'm not give up on anybody why because that's what god has called god has given us that that is our heritage that is our blessing was what god has given us god has called us to this so brothers sisters god has blessed us with these blessings with these gifts and it's you and i our job is to is to use them whatever whatever god has called you to be then then be the best that you can be we all we you know y'all we all can't preach and and uh you know not everybody can sing but you know everybody can pray but god has called each one of us to to a job to know what to do our part to know wherever wherever we go whatever we do god you know people will see jesus christ in you that we are the ones that are going because we're god's hands we're god's eyes we're the only ones we're the living epistles the script brother rem said that don't let the bride be in the blood see we're the ones that are able to reach out and touch people and help people just just think about being able to be the one you know all the all the things because there there's a day and you know you give a cup of water when he said when he said you when you've done it under the least of these he said i was hungry i was thirsty i was naked i was in prison and they said lord when do we help you when do when do we do all these things he said he said when you've done it under the least of these my children he said you've done it unto me just just think about the ones that of all the people in this world people changing people's tires people give you know people give gifts money monetary things they've done all kinds of things for people when when when there was nobody else whatever whatever the issue was is people has come along and helped them out give them whatever they had need of and it's like when they when they done all these different things that people talk about and then all of a sudden you know there's coming a day that god's going to remember those things that you and i are the ones that are able to bless people somebody somebody's able to do something to bless you when when god was speaking to abraham he said in you all the nations of the world be blessed that's that's an amazing thing to stand there and say in the in and and me all the nations of the world are blessed you know when you think about what you are and who you are you know malachi 4 tells us that that he would send elijah before the great and dreadful day of the lord and he said he'd turn the hearts of the children and followers to the children but yo he said lest i come and smite the earth with a curse so the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to the fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse you know it's it's an amazing thing sometimes could you imagine getting up in the morning and people say who are you and and what are you doing oh i'm here to keep the earth from being cursed because he said if it didn't come the earth would be cursed so that's what i'm doing and sometimes we go well that's that's kind of carnal but you know that's that's what god has done because through him blessing us the earth is blessed the all the nations of the earth are blessed because you and i have fulfilled the word god has fulfilled his word in us that you and i have come to that place so when we stand up and say well i i don't i don't know what to do i'm insignificant no you're more significant than you think you are god has called us to this place recognize who you are and what you do what you can do when the bride recognizes who she is and she can do the greater works you can do these things god called you to it said then we'll be an invincible army then the rapture will go amen amen god bless you now let's all stand we'll have the musicians to come but i'm looking forward to that great day of getting out of here lord let us just continue to be mindful of who we are and what we what we're doing and let us be faithful in everything that we do amen i want the world to know there's a savior the world i want the world to know that the word is right the bible is right because you know when people can argue over the scripture but when they see it living you can't argue with that you know they want to argue with with jesus and and the different ones about lazarus but you know lazarus died and you know everyone up knew it there wasn't nobody that didn't know lazarus was dead but you know what they wanted to kill jesus when they because they couldn't argue with the fact that jesus raised from the jesus raised him from the dead they couldn't argue with that well they wanted to kill jesus when he saw that but you know they couldn't argue with the fact of what had taken place and many believed on him because of that so that's our job to be the living word made manifest amen god bless you blessed amen 176. blessed jesus [Music] oh what
