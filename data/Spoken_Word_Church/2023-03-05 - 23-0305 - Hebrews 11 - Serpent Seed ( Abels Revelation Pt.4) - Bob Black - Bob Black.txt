TRANSCRIPT
========================================
God bless you Saints good to be in the house of the Lord let's just jump right in and we'll look at a couple of slides and then we'll we'll read our scripture what we've been talking about is is in uh Hebrews 11 of what what faith is and how that's the only way that you can please God and how Abel had a revelation and we just and and all the others Enoch and and all the other on that are mentioned in the Hall of faith in Hebrews 11 but brother R said in the power of God he said Abel by Revelation he saw that it wasn't fruits that brought us out of the Garden of Eden as some people still think it was but it wasn't fruits it wasn't fruit like Kain thought it was the blood of his mother who had made him mortal over his father now look how he's he's kind of uh uh yeah exactly he's correcting it was the blood of his father who made Immortal so he came came and offered the blood of a lamb by divine revelation no one did tell him anything about it but he by faith he seen the Son of God coming and offered a lamb and a figurative type and seeing that Jesus was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world and God testified that's the truth God will always Testify the truth now um this is Sunday school class you know it gives us an opportunity kind of kind of move back a little bit and just kind of cover some things um you know like serpent seed that the serpent seed doctor what what was Abel's Revelation why did he bring a lamb and so as we dive into this um I I I think Sunday school kind of gives us an opportunity to kind of kind of dive into this a little bit more and some of these slides um uh a few of them you know this is a a sensitive topic you want to deal with it with discretion and so forth but some of these are a little bit heavy-handed so I would give you a warning before I move to the next one this is about as heavy-handed as I'll get see brother R said in Fellowship he says there's an ele of Life In The Blood life is in the blood cell life comes from the male sex and that's where brother Brown that last quote that he corrected what he was saying from the male life comes from the male not from the woman the woman can produce life cuz she's the egg but she produces the egg but the male produces the germ The Germ of Life comes from the male because it's in the blood cell and in that blood cell lays life so now now that's what we're talking about this morning life you want to get life you got to you got to be with the male and in the blood cell in the state in the place of Jesus was not the sexual Affair of a man but the creative power of God so now he's talking about why you ever think U and maybe just say that the the reason there's a reason why Jesus had to come from a virgin birth it would had to be born from a virgin birth to be the antidote before they fall what happened in the Garden of Eden was not was not by the sexual Affair of a man but the creative power of God it created a blood cell in the womb of Mary with that egg that brought forth the Son of God which was the tabernacle that God lived in himself and so that's that's the stage for what we're studying on in verse four so let's just pray before we get into our little study and ask the Lord to bless it this morning Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather together around your word this morning and we just ask your blessings Lord as we study these things out you Quicken them to us Lord that it won't just be won't just be like the just the word uh that's not been quickened but we need we need you to come and Quicken the word to us to make it aive because without you it won't be aive but Lord if you come and give life to it then it'll spring forth into a living reality to us Lord that will live in US Lord we ask Lord that you'll just Quicken the word to us today Lord to be with brother Wade as he's prepared and studying Lord and that you'll set our mind in order Lord so that we can be prepared to receive Lord Jesus Grant it Lord we ask it in your name amen so in verse four it says by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain and you see how faith faith faith is the only way you can please God and by faith faith Abel had a revelation that went beyond just the teaching the education and the theology that maybe his mother and father had given him and of course they both came with a desire to to present their sacrifice the the way that they thought the approach should be but Abel had a revelation that's how he obtained he had obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it being dead yet speaketh by by it he being dead yet yet speaketh so God came on the scene and proved that Abel's Revelation was correct by accepting his sacrifice now if we look in some of these quotes brother R said in questions and answers law having a shadow he said just to just to paint that picture of what happened he said there stood Adam and Eve Eve a beautiful woman I can see there Adam with them dark Shaggy locks hanging around his head those bright flashy eyes look over to his little sweetheart Eve and such a perfect built woman and her hair looked up and her eyes as blue as the sky Adam loved her oh how he loved her but when sin entered in their little home was broke up because of an old lustful Beast the devil had got into an animal called The Serpent not a reptile remember the Bible doesn't say that the devil was a snake that's right he wasn't a snake in the beginning the snake wasn't like he is now in the beginning the curse put him where he's at the Bible said he was not a reptile he was a beast and the most subtle of all the beasts of the field he looked more like a man than anything you've ever had walked upright there's where the devil got in him and come to Eve this beautiful maid woman and she did what was was wrong now you look at what s subtle means that that's kind of a weird we we don't have when we read a book today we don't have any any it's very seldom where You' see a word spelled like that s u b t i l sub brother R said in the what that means is he said the serpent is that missing person between the chimpanzee and the man and he said he went and got dictionaries today from everywhere to look up this word what the word subtle meant it means to be smart to be crafty and so you look online and see what what that word subtil means it means it's it's really just an archaic spelling of subtle and it's no longer used in any variety of English though it's a modern word in French and German but what it means is mean to be real clever cleverly using indirect methods to achieve something somebody that's sneaky now you think about the beast in the garden being being sneaky enough to just kind of twist the words a little bit and you see you bring it over in the present day that's what the devil will do today is just twist it just enough to where you think well the the promise isn't for me I can't get my healing Twisted enough to where you don't understand how to be born again well as long as you as long as you just feel something you got it just twist it enough and then that keeps the promise from being fulfilled just just change it just enough so there uh now so so brother around he's explaining what what that Beast the serpent is the missing person between the chimpanzee and the man so let's let's just look at that for a second now what that means is uh you know Darwin started when he he wrote that his book the origin of the species after he went to the Galapagos Islands he he went out there and he saw um you can see on the cover of the book is all of these these finches that he saw on on the on the Galapagos Islands and you can see each of these finches um Darwin Darwin believed that they came from a a fch and uh they were a com had a common ancestor in South America that they all came from this descended from this one fch but they they they slowly began to develop these different characteristics ICS one fch on one Island had to had to uh get little bugs and stuff so it would it learned how to use little a little stick to get bugs and another would eat a certain kind of fruit where it needed a long beak so they started they started developing these little small characteristics you can see the pictures where some of them have big beaks and some have small beaks some have long beaks some have short be beaks so they all developed these little characteristics so Darwin got into his idea he could see where where you know things began it looked like things were evolved from a common ancestor coming from a common ancestor so he began to think you know I can I can see something happening but there's got to be so surely that happened with with uh we where we came from so he's looking for this transition what you can look at monkeys and see see things moving along surely there had to be where where is the link between a gorilla or whatever it would be a a chimpanzee or something and human there's got to be some a transition so that's the The Missing Link what's that transition Dar Darwin was looking for a transition and scientists have been looking for that transition because it you know you if if if if that kind of evolution were true and I want to pause just for a second now we believe we do believe that God went through a stage of Creative Evolution where he started from something simple and began to work up and something until he finally he achieved his Grand purpose to manifest himself in Adam and Eve in Harmony in the garden so we do believe in evolution in that sense where God is behind it God is the one that's orchestrating it but not just some halfhazard thing where like you look on the wall and you can see a clock there or you look in your in your on the desk and you see a book there and you just think well uh you think nobody made that book nobody made that clock now you look at a clock on the wall and you know that somebody made the gears you know that there had to be a grand designer behind it somebody to be able to have to have the knowledge to be able to put that together and make the make the all the things that go into it but see God is the one that's been behind it all the time so so see see brother Brandon by Revelation is is revealing to us who what where where the where the transition was between between like a monkey or whatever or whatever the lower form was to to get up to where the to the man and so in the serpent seat he said you can cross animals they keep getting higher blood higher blood higher form of life higher form till it climbs up into the man realm but the last connection here between here was cut off how many knows that science can't find The Missing Link all you know that why here he is here he is the serpent the missing link that transition now he said it now let's watch this just a minute he's smart smart and crafty smart and sneaky smart crafty enough to be able to have a conversation with somebody and twist things around to get to accomplish a goal accomplish a person that's the kind of person that this Beast was yet he's called The Serpent but remember he was the smartest thing there was and the more like the human human being than anything else there was on the field amen closest to a human being he was not a reptile the curse made him a reptile the Bible said he was the most beautiful of all and even the curse didn't take all of his Beauty away yet the Glorious colors of the snake is beautiful and his grace and his shrewdness even the curse didn't move it off but you remember God told him that his legs would come off and he'd go on his belly and you can't find one bone and a snake that looks like a human being and that's the reason science is lost but there he is so God took that transition and hid it so that science can't find it but you can see where it is by Revelation and even even you know you just look you just look everywhere in the world and the snake is a symbol of that that deception that happened in the garden it's a a symbol of of well I'm trying to be speak with discretion but y'all know what I'm talking about y'all it's a symbol it's a it represents what what happen happened the and the spoken word is the Original Seed he said now look Eve what did she do she received the wrong seed how did she do it now now here's something to meditate on how did she do it believing Satan's lie now as we as we Trace these things out we'll find out that brother bram's talking about two things at the same time cuz you got two wombs or a woman has two wombs a woman's got two wombs a womb in her mind where she first got to think about it think about it and receive it and then then the womb in her belly so first she received it at the wrong seed in her mind she started believing it wrong she believed that she accepted Satan's lie how many says that's right and the congregation said amen well sure it's right sure she received Satan's lifee what' she bring forth by doing it Satan said you know this is glorious this is a wonderful thing do you know you were made for that why you were actually made for this purpose oh was I oh it's Pleasant to the eye it's good you should you should try it but the Lord God said not that not yet wait a minute see where where last time we were talking about how that God wants you to just wait and that's our problem so many times we just want to hurry and force it to happen that's the Pentecostal problem is to force it and manufacture before you got Deliverance to try to force it and act like it just hold just wait just wait on it wait a minute but you know oh if we do we oh you surely won't die that slick tongue devil he ain't got Hooves and Fork tail no no they like to try to make you believe he's a Slicker behind the pulpit or some little Ricky with his hair combed down like a duck sitting on his back out there to harm some mother's daughter that's the guy come around with a little cute like little oh I'll let that go oh you can preach on that couldn't you you that's a father's responsibility is watch out for his keep watch over his family so that you know some of these little Slickers come around that uh maybe a little girl would be susceptible to the father's got to put that protective around anyway I'm I'm not here to preach we're just teaching now the womb Eve receives the wrong seed word she received the wrong words so it all always starts out in the womb of your mind that's where it starts out first now listen real close now we're going to drive this right down if the Lord willing she received the wrong word what did it do it was Satan's lie said she would be wise and the God of this evil age brother R said oh you see we bring it over to the present day because a lot of times you read these you start studying these things how is it going to help me right now to know this historical uh thing or whatever if if we can begin to discern the to recognize the devil in his tactic to see when the devil's doing something then you'll you'll have overcoming power then to see when the devil begins to move maybe in a congregation or your family or when somebody says something that that's not right and you cast that down and say no I'm sorry that's contrary to God's word and recognize when when the devil's moving and the God of this evil age he said eve never just simply walked out willfully say I don't believe in God she she never just went well today I'm not going to believe I don't believe in God no more see it's more it comes in more subtle than that more simple it was an error she believed it was an error Satan never come out and said oh well that's not even the word of God he admitted it was the word of God but he put his own interpretation to it which God plainly told them not to do it what does this do it makes a strong delusion for the Bible for the people to believe a lie and be damned by it in second Thessalonians 2:11 and brother Bram said in the spoken word of his Original Seed he said that's there's the three now this is a fantastic quote there's the three Adam Christ God the reason that Adam's bride never did beite the life child is because she disbelieved God's word if that's right say amen and everybody says amen the reason that Jehovah's wife was put away or his bride was because she rejected God's word the prophet and the reason that Christ bride he's now he's talking about the Pentecostals they they they hung on for a while but then they they just couldn't go on with the word the reason that Christ bride is put away in divorcement is because that she has rejected the word of God like Eve did like the rest of them all all polluted their husband couldn't get to them now see that there goes back to that second that second slide that I showed you got to be with the man you got to receive from the man cuz that's where the life come comes from they was already pregnated before their husband got to them oh God if that ain't a pitiful sight think of a young man coming to a woman and find her with seed of some other man in her what a thing that's what God has done that's what Adam done that's what Christ has done now now this next slide I want to look we're what we're talking about receiving a lie so you know brother Ram said that that the serpent seed came over the ark let's see what let's examine that quote a little bit he said now Noah and his sons which come out ham sham and japeth come out in the righteous line how did the seed ever get over how did it get over on the ark the seed come over in the ark just like it did in the beginning through the woman their wives they Carri the seed of Satan through the ark just as Eve packed the seed of Satan to give birth to Cain through the woman now this is why it's so important to examine the context of what brother man was saying look at what he's saying before and after look what he says right after he starts talking about preaching he starts talking about telling somebody something that's wrong you put them women in your platforms for preachers the Bible condemning it Paul said If any man thinks himself to be a prophet or even spiritual let him acknowledge that what I write is the Commandments of the Lord but if he be ignorant just let him be ignorant and the serpent seat again he said and I'm just reading reading some reading what brother Brown said he said notice this now and out of there then come ham ham with his wife and he had a curse put on him from ham come Nimrod who built Babylon out of Babylon come the Catholic Church the beginning of it come on down through Ahab Ahab into Judas and in this last day here is the spirit of the Antichrist and the spirit of the Christ what's the spirit of the Antichrist saying the days of Miracles is passed taking something that's true and twisting around so you think well God is not able to heal me any God's not going to heal me anymore he don't want to he the promise itting for me see I just take it and twist it the spirit of Christ saying he's the same yesterday today and forever and the spirit of antichrist said it don't make any difference you see why preachers just hammer on it so many so much that it does make a difference what you believe it matters what you believe it don't as Spirit of antichrist saying it don't make any difference if you're baptized in the father son Holy Ghost poured sprinkled or whatever it is it means the same thing the Bible said that God's infallible and he can't change who you going to serve it's up to you I see all these things what we're talking about is receiving something in the womb of your in in your womb and the spoken word of is original C brother said he said let's go back now and pick up again and come down for something you remember what last Sunday service was the gate to the soul now there is a womb of the physical there's a womb for the spirit did you believe that there is a spiritual womb and a physical womb and the mind is the womb to the spirit now see if you really meditate on this and God reveals it to you then you'll see how to be born again you'll see how to receive any promise of God cuz your the womb is the incubation place you let it you let God's word begin to incubate in your mind and you say I believe it and you hang on to it sooner or later you're going to have a baby born sooner or later there's going going to be a baby crying you're going to be able to come forth but why cuz you you accepted what God's word says and you stayed with it until now see there's a process you got to go through when you're when you're receiving the word of God God will take you through justification sanctification the little twitching muscles muscles twitching baby's not born again but then life comes forth and there you got a little baby and you pop it on the bottom or whatever and it takes that breath and now now you got life and that's how baby's born there's a womb a womb where that baby's being formed that that's what in second Timothy Paul telling Timothy he said consider what I say and the Lord give thee understanding in all things consider what I'm telling you if if we could do that this morning consider the things that it's not just something boring that's going over the pulpit but it's the it's the words of eternal life that if you consider the word of God then something is going to happen in Mark 4:20 he said and J Jesus these These are they which given the parable of the sewer these are they which are sown on good ground good ground somebody that will take God's word and hold it in the womb of their mind hold on to it until it comes forth and you can see it coming up out of the ground not just when it sprouts beneath the ground hang on let it incubate let it let it begin to grow until it comes forth and and and don't put a rock on it and don't let it get choked out by the weeds but hang on to it incubate it in that good ground and then these are they which are sown on good ground such as hear the word and receive it and bring forth fruit some 30-fold some 60 and some 100-fold and Luke chapter 8 now the parable is this the seed is the word of God you receive that seed hang on to it believe it and something's going to happen because it's a womb now brother BR said in the spoken word of the Original Seed he said when the Bride of Jesus Christ let L man-made Creeds and dogmas take the place of the word of God she's committing adultery did not Jesus say whosoever lookth Upon A woman has committed adultery with her already in his heart now now think about this when Jesus said you look on a woman you look on a woman with lust you're committing adultery in your heart why cuz that's the womb you're thinking about it you're thinking about it and something begins to move lookth upon a woman to lust after her heart hath committed adultery with her already he said why she let it come into his mind oh you see that's that's what's taking place when a woman goes out on the street or at the beach or wherever and she's unclothing herself she's trying to get she's trying to change that man's mind that looks at her because that's where it starts in your mind and a man looks on that woman and if he's not a holy ghost filled believer that that knows not to do that then his mind is going to start thinking about that cuz that's where it starts that's where every everything starts in your mind in your mind is where the battle reaches she let it come into his mind and that's that's why it's wrong sisters to dress wrong and to to dress like that cuz you're trying to influence maybe this will go out on the Airways it's it's try you're trying to change what that man is thinking about that's the womb that starts the things moving now see it all goes back we haven't forgotten our our topic that we're talking about why did Abel offer blood because blood it's the life it's the thing that you receive it all goes back to to to to these things the womb is the W the mind is the womb for the spirit to take in or let out and that's how they commit adultery is taken let some Satan devil Spirit put in them something against the word of God then she's committed adultery and brother Ram said in the mark of the beast he said your heart is a womb you know what I'm speaking of women and men your heart is a womb and the womb holds the seed and the seed is the gospel now the seed alone in his heart now now look this this is I know this slide is a little heavy-handed as we as we y'all can grin and everything I see the grins we got two more minutes but listen this is what brother R saying you might have the egg there you might have the teaching where gel taught Paul for year and Jesus taught the disciples for three and 1/2 years the word is there laying but it's got to be it's got to be quickened no matter how many GES you set under no matter how great your pasture is how much you've read the Bible it'll never take life until the germ of life has come to it a woman's seed is a wonderful thing it's the building of a body but it has no life it can't it's impossible it has no life to begin with so now no matter how much you know the Bible and how well it is in your heart you're still a sinner yeah what what are we talking about we're talking about what happened in the garden and what Abel's Revelation was and the mark of the beast and well maybe we'll stop on this slide he said what happens the heart is a womb and Faith cometh by an open ear that's not been sealed by theology Faith cometh by hearing that's what we're talking about in Hebrews 11 Faith to hear the word comes into the mind so if you want Faith this morning as brother Way's preparing to bring the messages this morning and this afternoon faith comes by hearing when you hear the word open up yourself to receive the word and you'll receive fa he said look he's he's giv us the recipe he's saying you make up your mind about it is that right could that be right well the Bible said so I believe it down into the heart it goes then it's a womb when you receive God's word we'll stop right there God bless you amen [Applause] thank you
