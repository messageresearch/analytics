[2:32] they hears ears or Jesus and that you'll
[2:34] just make this service tonight not just
[2:36] another gathering Lord but something
[2:38] special or that when we leave this place
[2:40] Lord that the the words that we've heard
[2:43] will echo in our hearts and it calls us
[2:45] Lord Jesus too long for the closer walk
[2:47] with you we pray we ask these things in
[2:50] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[2:55] Hebrews chapter 7 verse 1 verse 1 to the
[3:00] three didn't bring any glasses with me
[3:06] and it says for this Melchizedek king of
[3:11] Salem priest of the Most High God who
[3:13] met Abraham returning from the slaughter
[3:16] of the Kings and blessed him to whom
[3:18] also Abraham gave a 10
[3:19] part of all first being by
[3:21] interpretation king of righteousness and
[3:23] after that also king of Salem which is
[3:27] king of peace without father without
[3:30] mother without descent having neither
[3:32] beginning of days nor end of life but
[3:34] made unlike under the Son of God and by
[3:37] the priest continually and then first
[3:41] Timothy chapter six and instead of
[3:44] reading from revelation I'm gonna read
[3:46] from here because Paul's saying some
[3:48] things that that are are really good for
[3:53] this little message I believe so it's
[3:55] verse 13 he says I give thee charge he's
[3:58] talking to he's building up Timothy a
[4:00] little bit he's telling me how he should
[4:02] do and everything he says I give thee
[4:04] charge in the sight of God who
[4:06] quickeneth all things and before Christ
[4:08] Jesus who before Pontius Pilate
[4:10] witnessed a good confession that thou
[4:13] keep this commandment without spot
[4:15] unruhe buell until the appearing of our
[4:18] Lord Jesus Christ which in his times he
[4:22] shall show and I got that highlighted
[4:24] for a reason which in his times he shall
[4:27] show who is the blessed and holy
[4:28] potentate the king of kings and Lord of
[4:32] lords who only hath immortality dwelling
[4:34] in the light which no man can approach
[4:36] unto whom no man hath seen nor can see
[4:39] to whom the honor and power everlasting
[4:42] amen you may be seated the Lord is a
[4:45] blessing to the reading the word so as
[4:47] you might have noticed I'm gonna read
[4:49] some things about who is no kissing it
[4:51] but I want to title this with this
[4:53] message tonight now who is no kissing it
[4:55] but who is this King of Kings because I
[4:58] believe that that one of the things
[5:00] brother Branham showed us through this
[5:01] message is that as as God unfolds
[5:05] himself he reveals you are revealed
[5:08] along with Jesus Christ and there's some
[5:11] things that that happen through his
[5:12] unfolding I want you to pay attention
[5:14] now that to the things that that we just
[5:17] read there's there's three titles that
[5:19] were applied to this man who this man
[5:21] Melchizedek king of kings king of Salem
[5:26] which is P I'm sorry I missed that back
[5:29] the king of righteousness king of
[5:32] righteousness
[5:33] king of Salem and King of Kings see if
[5:36] you've got these three titles that are
[5:38] applied to this man to help us to
[5:40] understand who exactly this is that that
[5:42] that Abraham met with and that he slowed
[5:45] later on and then it's kind of talked
[5:47] about all down through scripture in a
[5:49] very mysterious way you know you know
[5:52] like a lot of the denominations they
[5:54] kind of probe and prod at who at this
[5:56] who would be this man what is the nature
[5:58] of this man milk is a dick and
[6:00] everything and you know that's something
[6:02] that really never really we never really
[6:06] could understand who Melchizedek was
[6:08] until brother branham the message came
[6:10] and this message was brought to allow us
[6:12] to peer into say the back part of God's
[6:15] mind and see what his great hidden
[6:17] mystery was and to see how it would
[6:19] unfold us so look at this look at this
[6:22] the king of righteousness it begins God
[6:24] begin is unfolding himself king of
[6:26] righteousness king of peace down to king
[6:30] of kings where he comes in authority he
[6:31] comes in manifest to himself in flesh
[6:33] and he has dominion because that's what
[6:36] the King does the King has Dominion he
[6:38] has authority he's not like a king today
[6:42] if he was a ruler of a house a ruler of
[6:44] a city or whatever it might be ruler of
[6:46] a kingdom if somebody were in that
[6:48] Kingdom that he wouldn't that he didn't
[6:50] want to be in that Kingdom he would come
[6:52] along and kick him out he wouldn't allow
[6:54] him to come in so you see that as God
[6:56] the condescends that he's descending
[6:58] what he's doing is he's conquering he's
[7:01] taking over he's booting the devil out
[7:04] of his kingdom that's what his purpose
[7:06] is that's what his plan is to is to
[7:08] overcome and so if you're a king if God
[7:11] makes you a king then he's made you an
[7:13] overcomer as well you see and so when
[7:16] when the word begins to unfold and
[7:19] reveal your place in your part in this
[7:21] mystery that you begin to see that you
[7:23] are an overcomer - and see it says in
[7:28] first Timothy it says which in his times
[7:30] he shall show which in his time as he
[7:33] shall show you know Abraham sitting
[7:36] there talking to Melchizedek as he he
[7:38] came after the defeat of the kings and
[7:41] he's sitting there across the table from
[7:42] him having communion and and you know
[7:45] God had given
[7:46] all of these promises about how all the
[7:48] land would be his and a lot of the
[7:50] things that that God promised Abraham my
[7:53] Abraham never really saw a Abraham
[7:57] didn't really see that all that he could
[7:59] walk through the land and look at it and
[8:00] he's God told him look to the left and
[8:02] the right and all this is yours but yet
[8:04] he had all of these battles and things
[8:06] and he would he would have fight for the
[8:07] whales and fight for the here everywhere
[8:09] he went he was constantly fighting but
[8:12] yet it was his children that he raised
[8:14] up on the admonition of the Lord that
[8:16] actually saw the land become his and
[8:19] then later on as the children of Israel
[8:21] crossed over
[8:22] Kadish Barnea and crossed into the
[8:24] promised land then the land was was
[8:27] finally theirs and they began to spread
[8:29] out but but they didn't Abraham didn't
[8:31] really see those things the things that
[8:34] God had promised him and you know you
[8:37] know the same thing could be said of the
[8:39] disciples where Jesus Jesus promised
[8:42] them he promised them speaking
[8:44] conditions he promised them to say to
[8:45] this mountain be moved but they never
[8:48] really came to that did they he promised
[8:50] it brung Paul promised the Thessalonians
[8:52] he promised them a rock she promised the
[8:54] Corinthians a body change he promised
[8:56] him things that they never never really
[8:58] saw but in the it went which in his
[9:01] times he shall show in the time that he
[9:04] is ready to reveal it to make it
[9:06] manifest that he'll unfold it and make
[9:09] it known and now is the time now is the
[9:12] time when we can look back to that king
[9:13] of righteousness we can look back and
[9:16] see what was written what was promised
[9:18] and we can lay claim to the things that
[9:21] are going to be made manifest in our
[9:22] libel Eve that people that are sitting
[9:24] here right now some of the people are
[9:25] going to be are going to be present when
[9:27] those promises were will be made
[9:29] manifest will be will be visible the
[9:32] body change the speaking conditions
[9:34] whatever you say say to this mountain
[9:36] whatever you ask when you pray whatever
[9:39] you speak speak it but to know but to be
[9:42] able to have access to those things you
[9:44] got to know where you came from and
[9:46] that's what the didn't that doesn't the
[9:48] scripture say that the Holy Ghost when
[9:50] he came he'll show you you know bring
[9:52] things to your remembrance and he'll
[9:54] show you things to come and so that's
[9:56] what the the Holy Spirit is showing us
[9:58] is take letting us
[10:00] Bax look back to the promises of God let
[10:03] us look back to the things that were
[10:04] written let us look into the mysterious
[10:07] things that were hidden through the
[10:08] generations and unfold the scroll and
[10:11] look in and say well it was written it
[10:13] was written of me in this day and you
[10:15] can look and see your life becoming a
[10:18] living reality of what was promised you
[10:20] can see the word being fulfilled in your
[10:23] life and in the lives of others you can
[10:25] see God unfolding his word to the church
[10:28] and that's what the king of
[10:30] righteousness is the king of
[10:32] righteousness what is righteousness neat
[10:34] mean rightness the king of righteousness
[10:37] was is rightness the pattern that
[10:40] everything has to adhere to everything
[10:43] has to match up with that pattern
[10:45] brother Brahim talked about how God that
[10:47] before the eternal was Ella helm was
[10:50] self-existing along with his attributes
[10:53] all of his attributes existed within him
[10:56] and he was the self existing God and a
[10:58] long waiting for those attributes to be
[11:01] made manifest the king of righteousness
[11:04] God along with his attributes you think
[11:08] about what what what what was in those
[11:10] attributes we know what an attribute is
[11:13] like a gene an attribute is like your
[11:15] DNA that says an attribute would be like
[11:18] your hair color or the way that you act
[11:19] the way that you know I can look at my
[11:21] children and see that they carry on
[11:23] might some of my genes and some of my
[11:25] wife's change some of the some of the
[11:26] things that that that the way my family
[11:29] acted they some of them have and there's
[11:31] some of the things that the way of my
[11:32] wife's family have and some of them are
[11:34] a little concoction and everything but
[11:36] we're talking about the genes of God and
[11:39] the genes of God are supposed to
[11:40] overtake the genes of man they supposed
[11:43] to is supposed to it's supposed to what
[11:46] I was talking about a king will boot out
[11:49] all the things that are not supposed to
[11:50] be there and if you've got a temper if
[11:52] you roll back when somebody says
[11:54] something to you if you can't stand
[11:56] ridicule then that that DNA it's got to
[11:59] overtake that somehow that king of
[12:03] righteousness DNA the king of
[12:05] righteousness where those genes in him
[12:07] he and all of these
[12:08] all of these attributes you know you
[12:12] know you know you wonder why I went
[12:13] there when he was offered taking
[12:15] communion with Melchizedek and it says
[12:17] there he paid tithes to Melchizedek and
[12:20] Levi who was not even born yet a long
[12:24] way from being born Isaac and Jacob were
[12:26] not even born yet but it was counted to
[12:28] Levi it was counted to Levi because Levi
[12:32] was in Abraham's genes Levi was in
[12:36] Abraham's genes what about you if you
[12:40] are in God's genes a gene waiting to be
[12:43] expressed part of that word waiting to
[12:45] come forth i'ma let me go ahead and jump
[12:51] ahead if if if you are part of God the
[12:55] things that happen to God the things
[12:56] that being a brother and preached about
[12:58] how you are identified with Christ
[13:00] you're identified with him when he
[13:01] walked on the shores of Galilee you were
[13:03] there with him when he died on the cross
[13:05] when he went to hell you were there with
[13:07] him because you're identified with him
[13:09] you were in him that attribute waiting
[13:12] to be expressed was inside of him so if
[13:15] you know where you come from if you know
[13:17] where you if you know your origin then
[13:21] you know what you've got when it gives
[13:26] you power to know what you've got to do
[13:28] in this age it gives you power to know
[13:31] that you are a living manifestation of
[13:33] God's Word if you take one of those
[13:35] little attributes of God and express it
[13:37] that's the father being expressed if you
[13:40] take if you take those attributes and
[13:42] show it out and express it the word is
[13:45] the as the father expressed and if you
[13:48] are the word living and walking and
[13:50] moving around on two feet then you are
[13:51] the father Express you think about what
[13:56] is king of righteousness king of
[14:00] righteousness is rightness the
[14:02] attributes the thoughts waiting to be
[14:05] expressed the attributes of Redeemer
[14:07] Savior counsellor Prince of Peace
[14:10] everlasting father mighty God all of
[14:13] those things in God waiting to be
[14:15] expressed waiting to
[14:16] the moment where he could be a redeemer
[14:18] sitting back waiting watching Adam try
[14:21] to be a redeemer and fail and then say
[14:23] well I it's part of me to be a redeemer
[14:25] and coming down and playing the part of
[14:27] that Redeemer killing the lamb and
[14:29] covering over Adam and Eve with that
[14:31] blood doing all of these things being a
[14:33] savior a counselor or the Prince of
[14:35] Peace
[14:36] that Prince of Salem the king of Salem
[14:39] the everlasting father but what else was
[14:42] in him waiting to be expressed we're all
[14:44] those of these attributes of a ministers
[14:47] ministers inside of him waiting to be
[14:49] expressed deacons sown leaders prayer
[14:53] warriors somebody that would get down on
[14:55] their knees and call upon God and still
[14:57] something happens homemakers a little
[14:59] people like brother around talk about
[15:01] carrying a lunch box
[15:02] we're the people that work we'll look at
[15:04] them and say that's a real Christian
[15:06] that's somebody that's manifesting the
[15:08] father they might not know who that male
[15:10] kids are their kids but that you
[15:12] nevertheless is being made manifest
[15:14] because they are the manifestation of
[15:17] the Living Word of God walking on two
[15:19] feet with not using their eyes using
[15:22] their hands speaking through their lips
[15:24] using their tongue God walking on two
[15:27] feet again
[15:29] you say well who is this milk is that I
[15:32] got home by the end of this sermon
[15:34] you'll know who is this milk isn't it
[15:36] gets got Christ in you the hope of glory
[15:38] revealed to get in flesh song leaders
[15:45] who worshipers the church filled again
[15:47] with the Holy Ghost power those are the
[15:50] attributes of God in the king of
[15:52] righteousness waiting to be fulfilled
[15:54] and when you see those attributes
[15:56] manifested then you're seeing the king
[15:59] of righteousness you're seeing God made
[16:02] manifest
[16:05] where did Abraham meet Melchizedek
[16:07] brother Branham talks about how Abraham
[16:10] was poor but yet he was spiritually rich
[16:12] he didn't have nothing of this world
[16:13] living in a tense being a nomad going
[16:16] from one to place partner from place to
[16:18] place and you know I often joke about
[16:20] how he goes message believers are kind
[16:23] of like nomads we're all constantly
[16:25] traveling going after that word
[16:27] people want brother branham priest you
[16:28] know people constantly on the road
[16:29] trying to get that word we're still
[16:32] nomads we're trying to try to feed our
[16:35] soul and he was looking why was he in no
[16:38] matter cuz he's looking for that New
[16:40] Jerusalem he's looking for the place
[16:42] where the king of Salem would reign do
[16:44] you think about the king of Salem Raylan
[16:47] reigning over that New Jerusalem the New
[16:49] Jerusalem typifies the bride a bride
[16:51] adorned with adorned for her husband
[16:55] coming down from God out of heaven that
[16:57] New Jerusalem is a city where it's made
[16:59] up of all of these people all of these
[17:02] people living there under the headship
[17:04] of their king sitting there and that's
[17:07] the that's the place that where Abraham
[17:09] was looking for and he he wandered from
[17:14] place to place and finally he met
[17:16] Melchizedek after the slaughter of the
[17:18] kings and you know brother Brown talked
[17:19] about how that that that Abraham went
[17:22] after a lot like a good backslidden a
[17:24] backslidden Christian he went out
[17:25] chasing after him and he and he fought
[17:28] that battle and he and he slaughtered
[17:30] the kings he slaughtered the kings and
[17:33] then brought a lot back to the place
[17:35] that he had left from and he restored to
[17:38] him all the things that he had lost and
[17:40] then he met Melchizedek because you
[17:43] can't milk it you can't meet Melchizedek
[17:46] until you've gone through a battle but
[17:49] you see his gods couldn't God a
[17:51] condescending he's coming down the king
[17:53] of king of righteousness king of Salem
[17:56] King Jesus all the way down and then he
[17:58] begins to go back up and the whole thing
[18:00] is a battle but Jesus on the cross was a
[18:03] battle the Abraham on the way to meet
[18:06] Melchizedek is a battle and you and I
[18:09] are in a battle we're fighting our way
[18:11] back in the fellowship with him you
[18:13] can't meet Melchizedek without a battle
[18:15] I think sometimes we want to have we
[18:17] want it we want things to go we want
[18:20] everything to go just perfectly smooth
[18:22] without any car accidents without any
[18:24] any problems in our life without any any
[18:27] things going going wrong but you know
[18:28] brother branham said the Bible teaches
[18:31] that suffering is what brings character
[18:34] you've got to have suffering suffering
[18:37] suffering in your life mold you into
[18:38] into a character where because you're
[18:41] pressurized on the inside you've got
[18:43] that power of the Holy Ghost on the
[18:44] inside pressing out you it mold you into
[18:47] the into somebody that trusts God and
[18:51] that leads upon here I'm not on your own
[18:52] understanding but you're leaning upon
[18:54] upon who Jesus is the king of
[18:57] righteousness and then he blessed them
[19:00] Abraham when he met mo kids that keep a
[19:02] Melchizedek blessed him that had been
[19:04] delivered of his enemies think about
[19:10] think about what that king of
[19:12] righteousness means in in that king of
[19:16] righteousness are all of your rights and
[19:19] privileges all of the rights and
[19:22] privileges of a believer and it's where
[19:27] you get your confidence from cuz you
[19:30] look back in God's Word and you say it
[19:32] says this it says this that somebody's
[19:36] got to fulfill it it might as well be me
[19:39] you know I believe it's about time we
[19:42] search out what our rights are you know
[19:46] Abraham when he was wandering around he
[19:48] was looking to see what his rights were
[19:49] as he went from place to place
[19:51] throughout the land this is mine and
[19:53] this is mine I own this I own this and
[19:57] one day the children of Israel they they
[20:00] came to Kadesh Barnea
[20:01] and they said spies into the land to
[20:03] search out what their rights were they
[20:05] went over in the case Barney and I set
[20:07] out searching out what their rights were
[20:09] to find out what the word said was
[20:11] theirs I'm talking about speaking
[20:14] conditions I'm talking about a rapture a
[20:17] body change I'm talking about things
[20:19] that were never seen by any of the early
[20:21] church they were never manifested to
[20:23] them but now it's time for that to be
[20:25] manifested and how is it going to be
[20:28] manifested at us unless we search it out
[20:29] and find out whether it belongs to us
[20:31] the only way we can find out whether
[20:34] it's ours or not is to get in dig into
[20:36] the message and dig into the tapes get
[20:38] to church and be a church when you're
[20:40] supposed to be and find out whether it
[20:42] belongs you you search out your rights
[20:44] and privileges
[20:45] you know when when the children of
[20:48] visual then when they finally got to the
[20:50] promised land in the book of Joshua
[20:52] talks about how they sent there was
[20:54] seven seven tribes that had not been
[20:56] given their inherit us yet and they
[20:58] wanted to know what's my inheritance
[21:00] they had come over worse what's my
[21:02] inheritance and so Joshua said go out
[21:04] through all the land go out and and and
[21:08] document where you all how everything at
[21:13] the rivers and the mountains and the
[21:14] streams and all the things the green
[21:16] grass documented in a wood in a seven
[21:19] part book and then bring it back to me
[21:21] and so they searched out the land and
[21:24] they went to find out what was their
[21:25] inheritance and they wrote it in a seven
[21:28] part book and now I believe it's the
[21:30] time when we can look into the seven
[21:32] part book and we can find out what's
[21:34] ours or not we can find out what our
[21:35] inheritance is it's time to look into
[21:38] the open book because it's open we're
[21:40] looking and we're not looking into just
[21:42] any normal book we're looking into the
[21:44] book of the king of righteousness we're
[21:46] looking into the book of the one that
[21:48] where your name was written before the
[21:50] foundation of the world how are you
[21:52] gonna know if your name's written there
[21:54] or not unless you go look in the book
[21:56] and find it you know they sing that song
[21:59] I wonder if John saw me I wonder if he
[22:02] saw me I think it's time but we don't
[22:03] wonder anymore I think it's time when we
[22:06] get into the book and find out for
[22:07] certain if he saw me over there why
[22:12] because it's time for us to get the mind
[22:14] of Christ and first Corinthians it says
[22:16] for who have known the mind of the Lord
[22:18] that he may instruct him but we have the
[22:20] mind of Christ
[22:21] the mighty were lost how astounding that
[22:24] is to be able to look into the mind of
[22:26] Christ not just the front part the but
[22:29] the back part the back part the thing
[22:31] that he wanted to unveil from before the
[22:34] foundation of the world the thing which
[22:36] is you and I God Christ in you the hope
[22:39] of glory and and you're sitting here now
[22:42] and being able to feast on the word and
[22:45] have the mind look into his mind and and
[22:47] fellowship with him and and oneness and
[22:49] unity let me calm down for a second
[22:55] recent quotes let's look at number one
[22:59] who is this milk is it a brother rap
[23:04] said now the true revelation of
[23:05] Melchizedek comes into view what he was
[23:12] God the word before he became flesh God
[23:16] the word cuz he had to be no one else
[23:18] could be immortal like him
[23:19] see I had father and mother you did to
[23:22] Jesus had father and mother but this man
[23:24] had no father no mother Jesus had a time
[23:27] he started this man didn't do you see
[23:29] what he said and there's a man there's a
[23:31] that man on the inside of Jesus that
[23:34] eternal theophany that never had a
[23:37] beginning one that was one day when when
[23:39] when that little that little germ cell
[23:41] began to develop on the inside of Mary
[23:43] and that had a beginning and then one
[23:46] day when he rose from the grave that
[23:48] body was glorified and it was called up
[23:50] to the Father and and then it had no
[23:53] beginning arena
[23:55] see I had father and mother you did -
[23:58] Jesus had father and mother but this man
[24:00] had no father had no mother Jesus had a
[24:02] time he started this man didn't Jesus
[24:05] gave his life this man couldn't because
[24:07] he was life and it's the self-same man
[24:10] all the time now there's a little
[24:12] mystery right there it's the self-same
[24:14] man all the time
[24:15] it was the self-same man before the
[24:17] foundation of the world
[24:18] it was the self-same man when he talked
[24:20] to milk wood when he talked to Abraham
[24:22] it was that self same man when he walked
[24:25] before Moses and he turned so he
[24:26] couldn't see his front face he could so
[24:28] only see his backside it was a self same
[24:30] man again when he walked on the shores
[24:32] of Galilee and now it's the self same
[24:35] man again veiled in his bride as
[24:37] yourself same man in the same man all
[24:40] the time it's the self same man all the
[24:45] time I hope God reveals it to you I
[24:46] believe I believe he's revealing it to
[24:48] us
[24:49] I believe we're getting something the
[24:51] self same person all the time notice his
[24:53] title king of righteousness
[24:55] now Hebrews 7 - king of right
[24:58] and king of peace he has two kings
[25:01] now watch Hebrews 72 king of
[25:03] righteousness also the king of peace he
[25:05] has two Kings there now since he has
[25:08] come in the flesh and received his body
[25:09] up and in Revelation 21 16 he is called
[25:12] the King of Kings he is all three of
[25:15] them together why is he called the King
[25:16] of Kings after he's received his body
[25:18] hook because now he could put his life
[25:20] he could L on the day of Pentecost he
[25:21] put his life inside of the believers and
[25:23] then they started that overcoming
[25:26] process they became overcomers he had
[25:29] already overcome what like we were just
[25:30] listening on that tape that was playing
[25:32] it before I come out he's already over
[25:34] cooking for us but you've got an
[25:37] overcoming work to do to because you got
[25:38] to believe him you've got to believe
[25:41] that he died and paid for your sins you
[25:43] got it you gotta believe that he paid
[25:45] the price you gotta trust in His
[25:47] redemptive work you gonna trust that he
[25:49] paid the whole price and you know that
[25:51] so it seems like it's so difficult for
[25:53] us we look around and we've got
[25:56] afflictions in our body we've got all
[25:57] these things happening we got turmoil
[26:00] that look around today and there's so
[26:02] many today have have problems in their
[26:04] minds and depression and all these
[26:06] things but I believe we need to look to
[26:08] you know you start getting in your mind
[26:10] that that you've had something so long
[26:12] that God's no longer able to deliver you
[26:14] that the devil has a right to stay there
[26:16] but the devil don't have a right because
[26:18] you could look back into that book of
[26:20] the king of righteousness does he have a
[26:22] right to stay there if you'll just
[26:24] believe he can get kicked out remember
[26:26] brother around hey the Bible talks about
[26:29] how after 38 years that little man at
[26:31] the Pool of Bethesda he was he was
[26:32] sitting there for 38 years and maybe he
[26:34] had got to the point where he thought
[26:35] I'm just supposed to stay like this but
[26:38] then Along Came Jesus
[26:39] Along Came that Melchizedek I remember
[26:42] the little woman that touched Jesus His
[26:43] garment she had been like that for 12
[26:45] years and maybe she thought well it's
[26:47] too late it's too late for me in my body
[26:49] I've had this for so long I'm just gonna
[26:51] have to live with it but then Along Came
[26:53] Jesus and she reached out and touched
[26:55] His garment and you could touch Jesus's
[26:57] garment right here just
[26:58] hearing the word just by sitting there
[27:00] in your seat just like that castle
[27:02] Cornelius said when the word was spoken
[27:04] they're feeling their heart and they
[27:06] believed it then they were baptized with
[27:07] the Holy Ghost you don't have to you
[27:10] don't have to do all these things all
[27:11] you have to do is just sit there in your
[27:12] seat and hear the word and believe it
[27:14] and you can be delivered and healed and
[27:16] feel the Holy Ghost it's not by works
[27:20] but it's by grace the grace of the Lord
[27:23] Jesus Christ that he saved us all where
[27:28] was I now since he has come in the flesh
[27:30] I say he is all three of them together
[27:34] seeking God king theophany King Jesus he
[27:40] is the king of kings it's all met just
[27:43] like soul body and spirit all comes to
[27:45] make one I see see how he put that in
[27:48] soul body spirit cuz look he's coming
[27:50] down and then he's going back up in you
[27:53] after he gives you the baptism of the
[27:54] Holy Ghost after he fills you with his
[27:56] life then you begin the overcoming
[27:58] process and you think it'll be easy and
[28:00] everything but God's working his way out
[28:02] as you let him as you open up the door
[28:04] as you open up the door to the world and
[28:06] you allow him to have complete
[28:08] preeminence at you and as you allow him
[28:10] to have kingship and authority and
[28:12] dominion over you because what does he
[28:14] do what he's taking over he's taking
[28:16] over your life he took over your soul
[28:18] now let him take over your spirit and
[28:20] then after he's took over your spirit
[28:22] let him take over your body they'll
[28:23] change it he'll make you just like his
[28:25] glorified body when he rose from the
[28:27] grave he's changing us why cuz it's time
[28:30] it's time that's all these thousands of
[28:35] years it's time for a rapture it's time
[28:38] for speaking conditions it's time for
[28:41] the for the sons of God to be made
[28:42] manifest also here's the father which
[28:48] was the first son and holy ghost the
[28:51] spirit king of righteousness the Spirit
[28:53] attribute theophany king of peace
[28:55] theophany and in flesh he was king of
[28:57] kings same person he said why is it
[29:01] important for me to know all these
[29:02] things why is it important for me to
[29:04] have this kind of confidence to know who
[29:06] them who is this Melchizedek and all
[29:08] that seems like just kind of a lot of
[29:09] teaching and everything
[29:10] let's see if you remember that story
[29:11] brother branham told about that slave
[29:13] that when he came over he said after the
[29:15] boat before the bowler war and the Dutch
[29:17] were still bringing over slaves into
[29:19] America and the slave he walked with his
[29:23] head held high not like the other slaves
[29:25] but he was walking around carried
[29:27] himself he when they asked you to do
[29:28] something eating him and Hall he went
[29:30] and did it and he didn't act like a
[29:33] sluggard or a lazy a lazy bum or
[29:35] anything didn't happen like you say this
[29:38] old lay out of spirit they ought to see
[29:39] a spirit on him but he walked with his
[29:41] head held high and they began to ask why
[29:43] did why does he walk like that you know
[29:46] the reason he walked like that is
[29:47] because he knew where he came from he
[29:50] could look back into the book and know
[29:51] that his father was a king one day he
[29:53] was going to be a king - and you can
[29:56] look into the book you can look back
[29:57] into the book and a king of
[29:59] righteousness and know that you are part
[30:01] of that king and would call you part of
[30:03] that king you or a king - because he's
[30:06] King the king of kings I think that's
[30:11] one of the most fantastic things that
[30:13] he's not just a king by himself and not
[30:15] but but in a part of him part of that
[30:18] that great glorious mystical body is
[30:21] part of that the attributes that were in
[30:23] him that were released on the cross when
[30:25] he was when he was pierced to decide and
[30:27] his spirit left and water and blood his
[30:29] spirit out from his side came Kings is
[30:32] what came out and came you and me and
[30:34] spirit was released and it was able to
[30:37] come back into the end of the people on
[30:38] the day of Pentecost the king of kings
[30:41] King of Kings oh my I believe if we get
[30:46] a revelation of that that you are a king
[30:48] that you don't have to put up with the
[30:50] devil you don't have to put up with him
[30:52] causing you all kind of problems in your
[30:54] life and everything I'm not preaching
[30:56] all the sinless perfection like that
[30:58] there's got to be suffering there's got
[31:00] to be persecution there's got to be
[31:01] thinking you know if you think that
[31:03] there being a message of believer will
[31:05] make it all easy and everything listen
[31:07] with being a message believer will make
[31:09] people look down on you being a minister
[31:12] will make people think you're crazy like
[31:13] Paul said the foolishness - the
[31:15] foolishness of the preaching the gospel
[31:16] the preacher things like this talking
[31:19] about the king of righteousness and it
[31:20] was this book it is
[31:21] you crazy but yet it's through the
[31:24] foolish use of the gospel that that's
[31:26] giving us authority and power and
[31:28] dominion over the things of this world
[31:34] listen you don't have to we were used to
[31:38] people would preach about cigarette
[31:39] smoking and all that kind of stuff cuz
[31:41] you don't have to put up with that
[31:42] that's something that gives you
[31:44] authority over there and how do you get
[31:46] Authority you resist the devil and he
[31:47] will flee from you resist the devil
[31:50] resist the devil and all that alcoholism
[31:53] and cigarette smoking and lust of the
[31:54] flesh and all that stuff will leave and
[31:58] that what's revealed in the seals
[32:00] yeah he's left that he couldn't take it
[32:03] anymore then he had to leave he had to
[32:05] get on his horse and get out of there
[32:07] because the word is present and where
[32:09] the word where that king of Salem is
[32:11] he's got to hit the road
[32:17] let's read number three the Easter seal
[32:24] brother Gramps had noticed God's life
[32:26] which is in the Greek called Zoe moving
[32:28] through them and in them quicken their
[32:30] minds to his word now let me say it real
[32:32] quietly now the Spirit of God that moves
[32:34] among the people quick as the mind of
[32:36] the person to the promise of God see it
[32:38] does it look and I'm trying to show you
[32:40] that and let you realize that I'm
[32:41] speaking now of the church and also
[32:43] quicken the life in him although they
[32:45] only was his attributes to begin with
[32:48] they only was his attributes to begin
[32:50] with but if God said in this day back in
[32:54] the beginning John Doe will be my
[32:56] servant millions of years ago now
[33:01] now what happens back there before the
[33:03] foundation of the world
[33:04] if God's thinking in his mind he knew
[33:06] John Doe would be a Christian back there
[33:09] think about let's make it personal he's
[33:11] thinking he thought of you right now
[33:13] right now this morning I believe if one
[33:16] day you will accept Jesus Christ as your
[33:17] personal Savior and be filled with all
[33:19] he goes he thought of you you were in
[33:21] him not not just thinking but part of
[33:24] him you were an attribute waiting to be
[33:27] expressed
[33:27] alright let's keep going now John Doe
[33:30] was born in sin shaped in iniquity come
[33:32] to the world speaking lot say he's not
[33:34] come to the world when the Holy Ghost
[33:35] already any even though he was attribute
[33:40] in him before the foundation of the
[33:41] world he still he came to he bypass this
[33:44] thing off and he didn't come to the
[33:46] earth with a theophany is had he hit
[33:49] that briefly
[33:49] now John Doe is born and seen and shaped
[33:52] in iniquity come to the world speaking
[33:53] lives because he's immortal but maybe he
[33:55] gets a little religious feeling he'll go
[33:58] join a church maybe he'll join
[33:59] Pentecostal church don't know he might
[34:01] join anything but let him get under the
[34:03] atmosphere of God once whoa what what
[34:06] I'm saying let him get under a good
[34:07] feeling what's the atmosphere of God
[34:10] it's your attitude toward the word the
[34:13] word not just a good feeling or
[34:15] something not just a good church service
[34:17] where everybody's singing songs that you
[34:18] like and everything somebody told me a
[34:21] few months ago they chose the church
[34:23] they went to because they sang the
[34:25] church the song that they liked that
[34:27] people don't go to churches or leave
[34:29] churches because of the word it's always
[34:31] something silly it's because somebody
[34:32] hurt their feelings because they didn't
[34:34] sing a song they didn't like the same
[34:35] song leaders all this kind of stuff what
[34:37] about the word let him get into the
[34:41] atmosphere of God once see John Doe is
[34:43] bound to recognize who his father is
[34:45] just as that eagle recognized who the
[34:48] mother was has got to realize that see
[34:50] only that John Doe is God's attribute
[34:54] they become a word spoken and then the
[34:58] Holy Spirit seeks that word out here it
[35:01] is he calls him gives him everlasting
[35:04] life and brings him into the presence of
[35:07] God God's word and how you think about
[35:10] this now how does God call you
[35:12] how does he call you if there's a little
[35:15] piece of word up there and in the mind
[35:17] of God waiting to be manifested when you
[35:20] hear that word spoken from behind the
[35:22] pulpit for people from off the tape
[35:24] that's God calling you and it falls into
[35:27] your heart and you believe and say
[35:28] that's got to be the truth and then what
[35:31] was that word receive connects back to
[35:34] the Father and now that God has called
[35:37] you back to himself that's what God is
[35:39] doing now he's and you receiving the
[35:41] word he's drawing you back up to himself
[35:44] he
[35:45] colony we jawed you by the spoken word
[35:48] because the spoken word is the original
[35:50] seed that's the original way that's the
[35:52] original way that the world was born was
[35:54] by the Word of God and that's the way
[35:57] that the Word of Life was falling down
[35:58] on the wood the out of the manger on the
[36:00] inside of your heart that word came to
[36:02] life because you heard it and believed
[36:04] it and then you say well I've got a
[36:06] right to go to any other Church because
[36:08] the songs they sing or anything like
[36:09] that you have no right to leave a church
[36:11] you have no right to go anywhere except
[36:13] where the word is preached where the
[36:14] true unadulterated word is preached they
[36:17] come right from the throne of God and
[36:21] when the Spirit of God comes upon you
[36:24] and you truly are one of God's
[36:25] attributes that he's spoken of now if
[36:27] you're not you'll wonder flush straight
[36:30] and running here and there and
[36:32] everything else and never come to the
[36:34] knowledge of the truth if you are one of
[36:36] those that all things pass away right
[36:38] quick see and you become new and the
[36:40] plan of salvation is finished you're
[36:42] ready to obey every word that God ever
[36:45] spoke of you see for you to do they
[36:48] you're ready to obey every word that God
[36:51] ever spoke of you to do they never spoke
[36:55] of you cuz you've got something to do in
[36:57] it Jesus had something to do all of
[37:01] these had something to do and you've got
[37:04] something to do you've got something to
[37:07] do and that's not it's not to produce it
[37:09] you don't have to produce it all you got
[37:12] to do is believe it and he'll do the
[37:14] producing I think that's one thing so
[37:16] many people think today they've got to
[37:17] produce it they say well why I don't see
[37:19] nothing happening and they look around
[37:20] and don't see it looks like nothing's
[37:22] really happening but it ain't up to you
[37:24] to produce it it ain't up to you to
[37:26] manufacture something all it's up to you
[37:29] to do is believe it you just receive
[37:30] that word and something will happen I
[37:32] guarantee you something will happen
[37:34] because you can't help it when the word
[37:36] is preached when the word is spoken when
[37:38] the word is received the word will come
[37:40] up that's that's the law of God when the
[37:42] seed is planted in good ground it's
[37:44] gonna come up it'll come up before long
[37:46] and you might not see nothing down under
[37:48] the ground underneath the dirt that's
[37:50] see you down there something's happening
[37:51] though you just give it enough time and
[37:53] you'll see it come up
[37:55] you'll see it made manifest people I
[38:01] don't see nothing happening you know
[38:03] that's the scary thing if you don't see
[38:04] nothing happening that means that your
[38:06] eyes are not looking inward because
[38:08] we're not looking in what I can see I
[38:10] look back like the little woman that
[38:12] testified I sure ain't where I used to
[38:14] be I believe up when I when I look at
[38:16] myself and see I ain't where I used to
[38:18] be no more to see all the old things
[38:20] that I used to do all that I used to
[38:22] have a horrible temper up for years I
[38:24] carry this scar on my hand where I slung
[38:27] a fist and my brother and broke it on
[38:28] the wall I had this terrible temper but
[38:31] you know what I ain't like that no more
[38:33] cuz God will get a hold of you and he'll
[38:36] change you and you look back hanging
[38:37] like that anymore when you look when you
[38:40] look around and say I don't see nothing
[38:42] that happened how can you say that how
[38:43] could you say I don't see nothing
[38:45] happening when you look inward and see
[38:47] that God has changing you from the
[38:49] inside out how is he changing you he's
[38:52] taking dominion over you he's coming in
[38:54] and he's booting out the devil and he's
[38:56] leaving he's leaving himself well that
[39:01] wasn't my nurse your your ready to obey
[39:06] every word that God ever spoke of you
[39:08] see for you to do you're submissive to
[39:10] his word the contract exactly the
[39:13] abstract to the contract the title deed
[39:16] belongs to you the debts are all paid
[39:18] it's all struck off and as it was at the
[39:21] day of Pentecost I didn't get through
[39:28] all this and and uh we're talking about
[39:32] that so we remember the king of
[39:35] righteousness the king of Salem which is
[39:38] the king of peace the king of Salem was
[39:41] the Jerusalem was called was was he
[39:43] short that down to Salem Jerusalem New
[39:45] Jerusalem is that Salem and the king of
[39:47] Salem is the king over that New
[39:49] Jerusalem so let's talk about that king
[39:51] of Salem because this king of Salem is
[39:54] that King theophany that came out of God
[39:57] I remember years ago I be I'd be laying
[39:59] on my bed and just devouring the word
[40:01] you
[40:02] you read the old things that the old
[40:05] sermons brother Brown preached about how
[40:06] that God was that fountain of life and
[40:09] how out from him came all all these
[40:12] attributes were in him and then out from
[40:13] him came that low loss that light the
[40:16] logos to the Kings theophany the king
[40:18] the king of Salem came out in the king
[40:22] of peace and and it was that word that
[40:26] came out that was as the way he said it
[40:30] the attribute of the fullness of God the
[40:33] attribute of the fullness of God the
[40:35] attribute of when it was a Nelly I'm
[40:39] waiting to be expressed you could not
[40:41] see you could not understand it but then
[40:43] that word stepped out and you could see
[40:45] exactly who he is if you could look on
[40:48] it with spiritual eyes and then it was
[40:50] that words theophany because brother
[40:51] Graham said God is not like just some
[40:53] kind of wafting spirit or something
[40:55] something without any kind of form or
[40:57] anything but that's the often you had a
[40:59] body and it had two hands and two feet
[41:00] and eyes much higher eyes and IR eyes
[41:03] much higher thinking than our thinking
[41:05] but it was a body a person somebody that
[41:08] you can actually fellowship with
[41:09] somebody the Abraham connect communing
[41:12] with somebody that Abraham could that
[41:14] Melchizedek Nash theophany could share
[41:17] part of himself within that communion
[41:19] that bread and that wine and and share
[41:22] some things about himself with and
[41:24] that's the Alpha knee that's the Alpha
[41:26] he began to keep coming down until they
[41:28] showed himself to Moses and showed
[41:30] himself showed himself to different ones
[41:32] but you finally it was veiled in the
[41:35] flesh of Jesus King Jesus let's read
[41:39] about that King theophany a little bit I
[41:42] can read here let's look at number five
[41:49] he said you shall see me that better
[41:52] all right you shall see me now if Christ
[41:54] and risen from the dead and we are given
[41:56] the invitation of the scripture that he
[41:57] promised that we could see him and that
[42:00] he would be the same yesterday today and
[42:01] forever and would you desire to see him
[42:03] would you if you'd raised your hands
[42:05] with every Christian believe that I
[42:07] would it with my hands up I would love
[42:08] to see him well now how can we see him
[42:11] the way we can see him is by his works
[42:14] now he hasn't coming a corporal body yet
[42:16] among us he's here in a spiritual body
[42:18] you believe that a spiritual body called
[42:20] the holy spirit he's in the form of the
[42:22] Holy Spirit at the beginning God was a
[42:24] spirit and all the fountain of goodness
[42:26] and mercy and all the good things of
[42:28] love God was the center of that fountain
[42:30] and then the logos that went out of God
[42:32] at the beginning become what would we
[42:34] would call a theophany or a supernatural
[42:36] body God is just not like the air but
[42:39] he's in a body
[42:41] Moses seen him pastors said it looked
[42:43] like the back part of a man and so forth
[42:45] and then that same theophan he was made
[42:47] flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld
[42:49] in the only begotten of the Father
[42:51] Christ now what kind of point are you
[42:53] trying to make brother ba a king of
[42:55] righteousness you were part of that king
[42:57] of righteousness because you were one of
[42:59] his attributes that was waiting to be
[43:01] expressed and when you heard the word
[43:03] preached for your day you received it
[43:05] and you were connected back to that that
[43:07] king of righteousness what about this
[43:09] king of Salem that this king of Salem
[43:12] was a body with hands and feet and you
[43:14] are part of that body when Jesus was
[43:16] when that's he often he was on the cross
[43:18] and that that earthly body that flesh
[43:20] was pierced it allowed that theophany
[43:23] body to come out so that it could come
[43:25] back in the people on the day of
[43:27] Pentecost you are part of that body you
[43:29] are let me tell you how much a part of
[43:32] that body you are you are so much a part
[43:35] of that body when brother Brown said it
[43:37] when Jesus stood on the shores of
[43:39] Galilee when he walked you were in that
[43:41] body you were identified in that body
[43:43] you were there well I was talking about
[43:46] earlier when he when he went down to
[43:48] hell you went to hell with him because
[43:50] the same life that you now having down
[43:53] in your soul that life was there in him
[43:56] that was the same life not a different
[43:59] life you are there as pre-existence of
[44:01] souls but you were there because that
[44:03] same life is now inside of you that same
[44:06] life now let's get it let's get real
[44:09] let's get real particularly here now
[44:11] when you were a kid and you went stole
[44:13] something out of the cookie jar and you
[44:14] put your hand in there and mama got you
[44:17] got in trouble with mama you pulled your
[44:19] hand out of the cookie jar and you say
[44:21] she'd say who stole cookies out of the
[44:23] cookie jar well my hand is
[44:25] no it was you did it your hand didn't do
[44:29] it you did it and so remember when we
[44:33] take communion wasn't it wasn't it Paul
[44:35] that said dessert do you not discern the
[44:37] body dessert do you not know what the
[44:39] body is when one of one thing afflicts
[44:42] one member of the body it afflicts the
[44:44] whole member of the body if one part of
[44:47] the body is spiritually sick it hinders
[44:49] the whole body if somebody's doing
[44:51] something out of place it hinders the
[44:52] whole body but what about when something
[44:54] good happens to the body because I
[44:56] believe when when brother Adam spoke
[44:58] those squirrels into existence he's part
[45:00] of the body so that happened to you and
[45:02] I when brother ran him on the shores of
[45:05] Galilee when he broke the bread and
[45:06] fishes everything that happened to you
[45:08] and I because we're part of that same
[45:09] body don't be looking at me like this is
[45:16] the foolishness of the gospel now when
[45:18] one thing happens to one part of the
[45:20] body it happens to the other and so we
[45:22] can go when when brother Dale called
[45:24] Randall back from the grave that
[45:26] happened to the body because he's part
[45:28] of the body when it happens to one point
[45:31] that's and so that that thereby there's
[45:34] no glorying at us when we lay hands on
[45:36] the sick and they recover and say well
[45:38] look at me look at the great faith I had
[45:40] because that's one great big glorious
[45:42] body
[45:43] God has manifested himself in the body
[45:45] of the church in the body of the
[45:46] believers and when God does something
[45:48] through one believer he's doing it
[45:50] through the body not not so that we
[45:53] could glory or anything
[45:55] listen if if any of these ministers come
[45:58] up here and preach a scathing sermon
[46:00] that'll get us to repent I don't say
[46:01] well goodness goodness me what if I
[46:04] could preach like that because it's the
[46:06] body it's the body there's no glory over
[46:09] here and there's no it's one great big
[46:11] body don't you see that's what this is
[46:14] where he started with his feet in the
[46:16] feet and he's building us up to the head
[46:18] there's one big body and he's
[46:20] manifesting himself and us as you
[46:23] receive the word one body what's he
[46:27] doing this this king of Salem the king
[46:30] of peace he's the king of peace but he's
[46:34] not the king of peace to the devil he's
[46:35] gay
[46:36] let me say this right not peace to the
[46:39] devil not peaceful
[46:41] to the devil to bring peace he's
[46:44] bringing Dominion and power and an
[46:47] authority into the devil's domain
[46:49] because this is the devil's domain and
[46:51] he's the Prince and power of the air
[46:53] he's you know he offered all these
[46:55] things to Jesus when he tempted him or
[46:57] if you bow down and worship Me I'll give
[46:59] you all these things I'll give you this
[47:01] all this domain but God is he's coming
[47:04] down to the Prince of Peace to kick out
[47:06] the devil you know you think well I can
[47:08] have peace in this life if I just ignore
[47:11] that thirst that God has given me I can
[47:14] have I can have peace if I just if I
[47:16] just obey the lust of the flesh and the
[47:18] pride of life and go out and fulfill
[47:20] fulfilled my carnal desires and all
[47:23] these kind of things you know there's no
[47:25] peace and just kind of sitting there in
[47:27] a daze in a fog staring at video games
[47:29] all day
[47:30] there's no peace going out to the bars
[47:32] and the clubs and all that stuff the
[47:34] only real peace comes through a
[47:36] relationship with the king of peace
[47:37] through Jesus Christ because he said
[47:40] I'll give you my peace he had peace when
[47:43] he stood there on that fishing boat and
[47:44] the storm came up when he was down and
[47:46] the bowels of the boat the other
[47:48] disciples didn't have peace but they
[47:50] were wondering how can you sleep through
[47:51] all this but he came up he came up from
[47:54] the boat and he said peace be still
[47:55] but he made that promise to us that I'll
[47:58] give you of my peace what's he giving us
[48:01] he's given us to eat of it to partake of
[48:03] that theophany that's the often in life
[48:05] that's down on the inside of a real
[48:08] believer which is what the attribute of
[48:13] the fullness of God that theophany isn't
[48:16] that's the offer T is they're all and
[48:18] all the attribute every with everything
[48:19] that God is and when he comes and puts
[48:22] that inside of you then he makes you a
[48:24] king I'm gonna jump on here cuz I don't
[48:26] want no it's Wednesday night I thought
[48:31] I'd be done in 30 minutes
[48:40] let's remember eight who was this milk
[48:49] kids day and Hebrews chapter six brother
[48:51] I'm said well this is Melchizedek king
[48:53] of Salem which is Jerusalem Prince of
[48:56] the Most High certainly who met Abraham
[48:58] returning from the slaughter of the
[48:59] Kings and blessed him too also Abraham
[49:01] gave a tenth part of all first being by
[49:03] interpretation king of righteousness
[49:04] that great love that great spirit in the
[49:07] beginning king of righteousness
[49:09] after that king of Salem which is the
[49:12] king of peace without father without
[49:13] mother without descent having neither
[49:15] beginning of days or ending life who was
[49:17] it
[49:17] he never was born he never will die who
[49:21] is that it was God sure it was in the
[49:23] foreshadow of the Lord Jesus certainly
[49:24] was but he had to come through a woman
[49:27] in the order you come through a woman
[49:29] and he had to come the way you come in
[49:31] order to bring you back to him he had to
[49:33] go see his condescending he come come
[49:36] down from the attribute to word
[49:38] theophany to flesh and he's taking you
[49:41] back he's taking you back now you come
[49:45] in flesh he took he's taking you back to
[49:47] restore you back from where you came
[49:49] from and you say why do I need to know
[49:51] where I came from you need to know where
[49:53] you came from so you can know what to
[49:55] manifest you can hear something you can
[49:57] know what to pray for what to ask for
[49:59] what to what you should be doing in this
[50:01] life that great Melchizedek the
[50:06] manifested word and peace his peace when
[50:08] he gives it to you it brings you joy it
[50:11] brings you happiness it brings you said
[50:13] why why does it bring you joy because
[50:15] you see the whole stuff that all life
[50:17] being chopped away you know you think
[50:22] about the Christian journey when you
[50:24] start you know you start coming to
[50:25] church and and and and it feels like the
[50:28] word and can be biting as it's chopping
[50:31] off things from your life that shouldn't
[50:33] be there and it's hurtful and things and
[50:35] things are saying it might might make a
[50:38] little tender hothouse Christian a
[50:40] little bit hurt a little bit but then
[50:43] one day brother Graham said this is a
[50:45] quote now he said one day
[50:48] you'll feel like the preacher ain't
[50:49] preaching at you anymore Wow cuz that's
[50:55] the actual quote I'll find it if anybody
[50:58] is there one day you'll feel like the
[51:01] preacher and preaching at you anymore
[51:02] why the preacher I'm preaching at you
[51:04] it's the word coming across the pulpit
[51:06] then that's cutting away at you and
[51:09] there's some things in your life that
[51:11] ain't right things that because he's
[51:12] molding you into the image into that
[51:14] perfect masterpiece and and the closer
[51:17] is what it does it brings peace to you
[51:20] because I ain't like that anymore I you
[51:23] see your life being changed you see your
[51:25] life being molded you see sin leaving
[51:31] let me let me jump ahead in my nose to
[51:34] the King of Kings I really don't want to
[51:38] keep everybody late 1st Timothy 6
[51:41] I'm trying y'all 1st Timothy chapter 6
[51:45] 13 to 16 this is the one that I read
[51:49] when I started I give the chart Paul to
[51:50] Timothy I give thee charge on the side
[51:52] of God who quickeneth all things and
[51:54] before Christ Jesus who before Pontius
[51:56] Pilate witnessed a good confession that
[51:59] thou keep this commandment without spot
[52:01] run rebuke Abul until the appearing of
[52:03] our Lord Jesus Christ which in his times
[52:06] he shall show he was going to show and
[52:10] it's manifesting time it's time to show
[52:15] all these things dwelling in the light
[52:17] which no man can approach unto whom no
[52:20] man hath seen nor can see to whom the
[52:25] honor and power everlasting amen
[52:32] so he's made us so we talked about king
[52:35] of righteousness king of salem king of
[52:38] kings because when he puts himself
[52:41] inside of you he gives you authority
[52:45] over the devil what what scripture what
[52:47] scriptures is that fulfilling it's
[52:49] fulfilling that scripture where
[52:51] Melchizedek promised Abraham your seed
[52:54] will possess the in the gates of the
[52:57] enemy your seed will possess the gates
[53:00] of the enemy all these other
[53:02] scriptures that that speak of how that
[53:05] the devil would be under your feet and
[53:07] all these things you don't listen you
[53:08] don't have to put up with the devil in
[53:10] your life I think I think now is the
[53:13] time where the devil is it like brother
[53:15] Wade was preaching on all those
[53:16] thousands and thousands of demons that
[53:18] went after the Jews now they're released
[53:20] on the bride if now they're after us how
[53:23] much more should we be in the word how
[53:25] much more authority and Dominion should
[53:27] we have if God has given it to us if
[53:30] it's an attribute that was written in
[53:32] him before the foundation of the world
[53:34] now it's time for that attribute to be
[53:35] made manifest it's time for us to resist
[53:40] the devil and not not giving him because
[53:42] look it's story time
[53:46] I'm gonna get into a story cuz listen
[53:49] there's a lot of kings in the Bible that
[53:51] could look back into the scripture and
[53:54] see what God said about them like Josiah
[53:56] Josiah was written there in first Kings
[53:59] it said just some a profit out of
[54:01] nowhere come up out of the wilderness
[54:02] ran to the altar and said there's gonna
[54:04] be a man a little boy raised up named
[54:06] Josiah that's gonna tear down these
[54:09] offers and burn the people that burnt
[54:11] that burnt incense upon this altar and
[54:13] Josiah later on in second Kings the
[54:16] little boy eight years old were raised
[54:18] up and they put a crown on his head and
[54:21] and I believe now this is just me maybe
[54:23] but he could look back in first Kings
[54:26] look back and see what that prophet had
[54:29] said about him he could look back and
[54:31] see well I'm I'm going it's written to
[54:33] me to go tear down these altars it's
[54:36] written to me to go destroy and to
[54:38] utterly purge all the land and you know
[54:41] he was just a little boy he was just a
[54:43] little eight-year-old boy but you think
[54:44] about you think well you got to be an
[54:45] adult or something you got to be old to
[54:48] be a good Christian no listen listen
[54:50] there's plenty of people Daniel the
[54:51] young people that went down into the
[54:53] Babylon Daniel and all the three Hebrew
[54:55] children they were just young mean a day
[54:58] you would lay before the Lord three
[54:59] times a day and he said when they wanted
[55:01] him to eat all the things that were
[55:04] prohibited it for him for them to eat he
[55:07] said we're not gonna eat that
[55:08] but we're gonna trust in the Lord and
[55:10] you think about Daniel and all the ones
[55:12] that they
[55:13] testament all the ones in the news there
[55:14] were young man you don't have to be old
[55:16] you don't have to be ancient to believe
[55:19] the gospel but the one I want to talk
[55:22] about is David because David was the one
[55:25] that was taken out of the sheep coat and
[55:26] they and they and Samuel the Prophet
[55:28] came and and went through all of his
[55:31] brothers and finally got down to the one
[55:32] where I don't have anymore bring
[55:34] somebody do you have anybody else it
[55:38] looked like even his dad was like now
[55:40] surely not David
[55:42] but they went out and brought David in
[55:44] and they they Samuel anointed him with
[55:46] oil but he didn't quite enter the
[55:50] kingdom yet there was a little bit of
[55:52] time and you because you see David was
[55:58] anointed three times before he took the
[56:01] kingdom one two three three times before
[56:07] he took the kingdom but look look how
[56:10] his attitude changed see we brought
[56:13] around told us how he he went through
[56:15] some things before that anointing oil
[56:16] was a report on his head first team that
[56:19] that bear came to attack the sheep and
[56:20] and he gave that testimony later on God
[56:23] was able to deliver me of that from that
[56:25] bear from that line he was able to do
[56:27] those things for me like God was taking
[56:29] him through justification and
[56:30] sanctification God was able to do that
[56:33] for me but then without anointing oil
[56:34] was poured on his head he knew he was
[56:36] gonna come to his kingship because it
[56:38] had have been spoken for him he was
[56:41] gonna be it was written of him to
[56:43] fulfill the kingship he was going to be
[56:46] a king and so with anything stood in his
[56:49] way he approached it with authority with
[56:53] Dominion just the way a real believer
[56:57] has to today
[56:58] how do you how do you approach when the
[57:01] devil comes at you when the devil comes
[57:03] at you with lies and things I remember
[57:06] when I when their Lord but first began
[57:07] dealing with me and maybe the devil
[57:11] began to deal with me differently than a
[57:13] lot of other people if you might call it
[57:15] schizophrenia or something but I began
[57:16] to hear voices and I would hear a voice
[57:18] that would tell me all day long it would
[57:20] speak to me and say you ain't you can't
[57:22] be a real Christian you can't you can't
[57:24] fulfill this word this is
[57:26] for you you've already passed your that
[57:28] the day in the hour that you could be a
[57:30] Christian you've already blaspheme and
[57:32] it will constantly rail at me it
[57:33] costantly but yeah I ran in the Bible
[57:36] reading the message where brother Brown
[57:38] said you fight back at the gate of the
[57:40] devil with the word you fight back just
[57:42] the same way that Jesus fought back
[57:44] against the devil so I began to quote to
[57:47] him I began to speak to him but you're a
[57:49] liar that God is still able and I
[57:53] remember I read that scripture where it
[57:55] said Jesus told the disciples he said it
[57:57] God is able of these stones to raise up
[58:00] children unto me and I would quote that
[58:02] back to the devil I said if that
[58:03] scripture was true back there and it's
[58:05] got to be true now if God is able of
[58:07] these stones to raise up children unto
[58:09] Abraham so you speak you speak back to
[58:13] the devil and here you resist him and
[58:15] he'll leave you he'll leave you alone
[58:16] eventually and so that's what David did
[58:19] when when he was confronted with Goliath
[58:21] he spoke to the sick of life goliath was
[58:24] own dalish territory david was the king
[58:27] over all Israel and Goliath came in
[58:29] there to mess with his authority with
[58:31] his Dominion and some when he came when
[58:33] he sold when he saw glass
[58:35] railing at all the people all the
[58:37] Israelites he said why why has nobody
[58:39] else going up against this giant and you
[58:42] know maybe sometimes sometimes when
[58:44] you're sitting in message churches and
[58:46] looking around you wonder why why is
[58:47] nobody else going up why is nobody else
[58:51] trying to tack on the devil has nobody
[58:57] else going up let me let me read if I
[59:00] can find it what he said and David said
[59:08] unto Saul thy serpent kept us at Lissa's
[59:11] 1st Samuel 17 and 34 to 37
[59:13] David said unto Saul thy servant kept
[59:15] his father's sheep and there came a lion
[59:17] and a bear and took a lamb out of the
[59:19] flock and went out and I went out after
[59:21] him and smote him and delivered it out
[59:22] of his mouth and when he rose against me
[59:25] I called him by his beard and smote him
[59:26] as fluid that service slew both the lion
[59:29] and the bear and this uncircumcised
[59:30] Philistine shall be as one of them
[59:32] seeing he has to fire the armies of the
[59:35] Living God my and we could
[59:36] God's Word like that if we could take
[59:39] God's Word we have sickness in our
[59:41] members when we have things in our a
[59:42] like I said whatever take God's Word
[59:45] when you're looking at a body change
[59:48] David said moreover the Lord that
[59:51] delivered me out on the paw of the lion
[59:52] and out of the paw of the bear he will
[59:55] deliver me out of the hand of this
[59:56] Philistine and Saul said unto David go
[1:00:00] and the Lord be with thee that same god
[1:00:03] that was able to deliver me out of the
[1:00:04] paw of the lion
[1:00:05] out of the hands of the line sometimes I
[1:00:08] think we forget what God has done for us
[1:00:10] I was talking to a Christian recently
[1:00:13] that he was he was thinking I just can't
[1:00:14] remember the last time that God did
[1:00:17] anything for me personally I've seen God
[1:00:18] do life and so you know what I did I
[1:00:20] began to quote back to him the things
[1:00:22] that I had seen God do it is like
[1:00:25] sometimes we need one another to remind
[1:00:28] us of the things that that have happened
[1:00:29] because the same God that brought you
[1:00:32] out of those things before the same God
[1:00:34] is able to deliver you from this Goliath
[1:00:35] whatever that Goliath might be God is
[1:00:38] able to deliver he listen he's able to
[1:00:40] restore your children he's able to bring
[1:00:42] them back
[1:00:43] you just got to speak it speaking like
[1:00:46] David did it's got a spoken word as the
[1:00:48] original seed somebody's got to speak it
[1:00:51] and might as well be you let's keep
[1:00:54] reading the first signal 1744 and the
[1:00:57] Philistines said to David come to me
[1:00:59] well it's another devil will do this is
[1:01:01] the devil speaking to David it just like
[1:01:04] the devil spoke to me come to me and I
[1:01:07] will give that flesh under the fowls of
[1:01:09] the air and to the beasts of the field
[1:01:12] listen David answer back with a backbone
[1:01:15] not a little old wishy-washy where I may
[1:01:18] be and maybe I'll go to church this
[1:01:20] Sunday maybe I'll try to do the things
[1:01:22] that are required of me as a Christian
[1:01:24] maybe I'll maybe I'll do it but he asked
[1:01:26] her back with boldness because he was a
[1:01:28] king and you are a king you are one of
[1:01:31] the one of the Kings Kings a child of
[1:01:35] the king
[1:01:35] thou comes to me with a sword and with a
[1:01:38] spear and with a shield but I come to
[1:01:39] thee in the name of the Lord of hosts
[1:01:41] the God of the armies of Israel whom
[1:01:43] thou has defied this day will the Lord
[1:01:46] deliver the end of mine hand and I will
[1:01:48] smite the end
[1:01:49] not hand head from the and I will give
[1:01:51] the caucuses of the host of the
[1:01:53] Philistines this day under the fowls of
[1:01:55] the air and to the wild beasts of the
[1:01:57] earth that all the Earth may know that
[1:01:58] there is a God in Israel and all this
[1:02:01] assembly shall know that the Lord save
[1:02:03] us not with sword and spear for the
[1:02:05] battle is the Lord's and He will give
[1:02:06] you into our hands and we read about how
[1:02:11] David ran to meet him but look this is
[1:02:13] how David conducted himself through all
[1:02:16] those anointings and through each
[1:02:19] anointing more and more of his den amis
[1:02:22] died away at the second anointing assal
[1:02:25] had just died away not at the hand of
[1:02:27] David but it was God that cleared the
[1:02:29] way for him to become king at the phial
[1:02:32] anointing when he became king ish
[1:02:33] persist had just passed away and not at
[1:02:36] the hand of David it was a devar that
[1:02:38] did it it's not you it has to produce it
[1:02:40] God will do the producing at the end of
[1:02:43] the end the end of it then all the
[1:02:45] children of Israel came and crown
[1:02:47] crowned David and what was their
[1:02:49] testimony their testimony was said they
[1:02:53] said you we are bone of that bone and
[1:02:56] flesh of thy flesh where thy bone and
[1:03:00] not flesh and that sounds a lot like
[1:03:03] Adam's testimony of Eve she is bone of
[1:03:06] my bone and flesh of my flesh see you
[1:03:10] got that you got to come to authority
[1:03:12] and Dominion but to get there it's gonna
[1:03:14] take a lot of persecution it takes a lot
[1:03:16] of trials it takes where people look
[1:03:19] like people at church talking about you
[1:03:21] it takes all kinds of sorrow and a long
[1:03:23] nights of agonizing prayer and reading
[1:03:26] and studying and getting in the word and
[1:03:28] then finally you'll come forth
[1:03:30] victorious through those three
[1:03:32] anointings the musicians can come
[1:03:37] because what is it God is making himself
[1:03:41] manifest in the bride God is manifesting
[1:03:44] himself who is this Melchizedek who is
[1:03:47] Melchizedek is the self same person all
[1:03:49] down to history he's the self same one
[1:03:52] he was the one that was the word before
[1:03:54] the foundation of the world the Son of
[1:03:55] God that spoke the world into existence
[1:03:58] he was the one that came and walked with
[1:04:00] Adam and even
[1:04:01] garden he was the one that killed that
[1:04:03] lamb and put the put the lamb skills
[1:04:06] over him he was the one that veiled him
[1:04:08] said they bailed himself under the
[1:04:10] badger skins of the wilderness and the
[1:04:12] one that veiled himself Tavern at
[1:04:13] Tabernacle in Jesus Christ and now
[1:04:16] Melchizedek availing himself and you the
[1:04:19] king of righteousness the king of Salem
[1:04:21] and King Jesus the King of Kings do
[1:04:59] gospel ship receive

[1:09:51] be brought from the Bible talk with the

[1:10:02] children
[1:10:02] the Bible declares is all we got to do
[1:10:06] is believe it so then what's making us
[1:10:09] say nothing's taking place is that devil

[1:14:05] moment God started changing things why
