[31:15] image
[31:16] and in your likeness we were made
[31:19] thank you Father for that thank you that
[31:22] we were born again
[31:25] that we have a new life
[31:28] and this life that we live now craves

[31:33] church and it it has a desire to be to
[31:36] have fellowship and friendship and and
[31:39] just come around Lord and in a sanctuary
[31:42] or even when you're standing around

[32:06] Jesus name
[32:07] amen
[32:09] all right we've been on the son of man
[32:10] and we're going to continue on heading
[32:12] up to the son of man but we're on the
[32:14] Statue of a perfect man and we'll bring
[32:15] out a few things today a little bit uh
[32:18] in addition to so let's read John 1 1
[32:21] says in the beginning was the word the
[32:24] word was with God and the Word was God
[32:27] and that word was made flesh and dwelt
[32:31] among us and we beheld his glory in
[32:33] other words it wasn't hidden we beheld
[32:34] his glory
[32:35] the glory of the only begotten father of
[32:38] the father full of grace and truth all
[32:41] right II Peter 1 verse 5 and besides
[32:43] this giving all diligence add to your
[32:46] faith virtue divert your knowledge and
[32:47] all his Temperance Temperance patience
[32:49] patience godliness and the godliness
[32:51] brotherly kindness and the brotherly
[32:53] kindness charity you may be seated in
[32:56] the Lord has blessing
[32:57] to the reading of the word
[33:00] First Timothy 3 16 says without
[33:02] controversy in other words without
[33:04] argument without us having to go into
[33:06] acts 13 or 14 000 different people
[33:09] denominations all right there's twelve
[33:12] or thirteen thousand brother Brown said
[33:14] there was 900 back in the 60s well
[33:15] there's 13 000 now if you look it up and
[33:18] I know it's true because it's on I got
[33:19] it off the internet
[33:21] yeah
[33:21] praise the Lord anyway and without
[33:24] controversy great is the mystery of
[33:26] godliness so there is a mystery and it
[33:30] is great
[33:31] and it's of godliness and as we've been
[33:33] talking where is that godliness now
[33:37] Colossians 1 verse 21 says in you that
[33:40] were sometimes alienated the enemies in
[33:42] your mind by Wicked Works hello we were
[33:44] all there
[33:45] yet now hath he reconciled in the body
[33:48] of his flesh through death to present
[33:51] you holy and unblameable in other words
[33:53] we have a new father
[33:55] all right we were birthed by our first
[33:57] father and and that we were birthed into
[34:00] death
[34:01] come on
[34:02] but now by the new birth we've been
[34:05] birthed again that's why Jesus said you
[34:07] must be born again birth into Life by
[34:10] our new father or by Our Father the
[34:14] original one all right
[34:16] so now in Colossians it says in the body
[34:18] of his flesh true death to present you
[34:22] he's going to present you holy and
[34:25] unblameable and unreprovable in his
[34:28] sight all right thereby with me that if
[34:32] you continue in the faith grounded and
[34:35] settled be not moved away from the hope
[34:37] of the Gospel
[34:38] which you have heard all of you in this
[34:42] building have heard the truth amen you
[34:45] have heard what the world is looking for
[34:47] they're looking for a trumpet they're
[34:49] looking for it
[34:51] to bring God on the same
[34:53] no it's a message and that message has
[34:56] already sounded the trumpet is sounded
[34:58] and you're a recipient of hearing that
[35:00] message and you're also a recipient of
[35:02] sounding that message amen
[35:05] final voice
[35:06] final trumpet to the final age
[35:09] if you continue in the faith grounded
[35:11] and settled and bema moved and be not
[35:13] moved away from the hope of the Gospel
[35:15] which you have heard and which was
[35:17] preached to Every Creature yeah it's hot
[35:19] in here which is under Heaven whereby
[35:21] Paul and made a minister come out now in
[35:24] the janitor
[35:26] well Aaron's not here so
[35:30] that was easy
[35:35] who now Rejoice all right now time back
[35:37] in
[35:38] who now rejoice in my sufferings for you
[35:40] this is Paul talking he's a minister
[35:43] he's ministering this gospel to his
[35:45] people well the word is eternal so he's
[35:48] ministering to us right now who now
[35:51] rejoice in my suffering for you and fill
[35:53] up that which is behind of the
[35:55] afflictions of Christ in my flesh for
[35:57] his body's sake which is what the church
[36:00] he was building the body of the Church
[36:03] of the first church age he was built
[36:05] starting to build this body that God was
[36:08] going to inhabit all right where have I
[36:10] am made a minister according to the
[36:12] dispensation of God which is given to me
[36:14] for you to fulfill the word of God now
[36:17] watch even the mystery now here we go
[36:20] there was a mystery of godliness right
[36:23] listen it's a total mystery to the world
[36:25] how you can live Godly but you can
[36:28] right all right even the mystery which
[36:30] hath been hid from ages and generations
[36:32] so in other words it's been hit
[36:34] but now is made manifest to his
[36:38] preachers
[36:41] that's not what that says that says to
[36:44] all of us to his Saints that's me and
[36:48] you
[36:49] to whom God would make known what is the
[36:51] riches of the glory of this mystery
[36:53] among the Gentiles which is Christ in
[36:55] you so what is the mystery of godliness
[36:58] what is this great controversy that the
[37:00] world has come upon now that they don't
[37:02] even know what gender they are
[37:05] now you got you know you got the
[37:07] Methodist they split on on the gays and
[37:09] all that stuff now you got the southern
[37:11] baptist the good old southern baptist
[37:13] they're splitting from a group because
[37:14] they're Latin women come in and preach
[37:16] well praise God for the Baptists that
[37:18] are standing strong
[37:21] but listen we don't have to fight that
[37:23] fight
[37:24] oh we have fights to fight in the
[37:26] message don't get me wrong but we don't
[37:28] have those major doctrines to tear our
[37:31] church apart I mean Heavenly days if you
[37:33] if you think anyway all right to whom
[37:36] God would make known what is the riches
[37:38] of the glory of this mystery
[37:40] which is Christ in you the hope of glory
[37:43] whom we preach warning every man and
[37:46] teaching every man in all wisdom that we
[37:49] may present every man perfect
[37:52] are complete in Christ
[37:55] where unto also labor striving according
[37:57] to his work which worketh in me mightily
[38:00] praise God for a man named Paul amen but
[38:03] praise God for a man named William Brown
[38:06] amen
[38:07] that brought us the truth
[38:09] all right so now that we can come to
[38:11] Godliness now that we know what
[38:13] godliness is we know as I've been
[38:15] telling you many many times before if
[38:17] you look at the world and and you say
[38:19] well that's an ungodly generation you
[38:21] know what's the most ungodly thing is
[38:24] false Doctrine
[38:26] false Doctrine is the most ungodly thing
[38:28] in the world he hates that
[38:30] he hates that diesel in the Nicolaitans
[38:32] he hates those things that we're
[38:34] supposed to be the great Church of Jesus
[38:37] Christ yet we're worshiping the devil
[38:39] now I'm not talking about us I'm talking
[38:41] about the world the denomination of the
[38:42] world because listen sin is not all the
[38:45] smoking drinking cussing running around
[38:46] all that stuff brother I'm already made
[38:48] that real clear
[38:49] he said the greatest sin was unbelief
[38:52] all right so now that we've been brought
[38:55] the truth and we start believing the
[38:58] truth
[38:59] we can come to Godliness
[39:01] all right which is reverence or respect
[39:04] our piety towards God
[39:07] statue of perfect man brother Brown I
[39:10] took this quote and condensed it down he
[39:12] was talking about godliness and brother
[39:14] Brown said you say I can't do that
[39:16] brother Branham oh yes you can
[39:19] all right now listen what did the
[39:21] prophet come to do he comes to tell us
[39:23] the mind of God he come to tell us what
[39:25] God wants us to know without any filter
[39:28] without any denominational idea he
[39:30] wanted us to know the truth so brother
[39:32] random is preaching the truth in the
[39:34] Statue of perfect man that's all brother
[39:36] round we can't do it I'm sure he's
[39:37] Discerning all over the building and
[39:39] they're like oh we can't do that we
[39:40] can't do this we can't do that and he
[39:42] said oh yes you can
[39:44] then he proceeds to tell us how
[39:48] and here's a hang up
[39:50] deity
[39:51] that word deity we just we just pull
[39:54] away from
[39:56] I'm not deity well
[39:58] the prophet of God said if you have the
[40:00] new birth you are deity
[40:02] okay so deity is Supernatural now you
[40:06] didn't you wasn't born a deity
[40:09] all right you weren't born a deity
[40:11] but you were born in sin but you became
[40:14] into this family of God
[40:17] by the new birth which makes you deity
[40:22] the divine nature of deities is believed
[40:24] to be immortal goodness and powerfulness
[40:27] any supernatural being
[40:30] listen to what brother Brown said he
[40:32] swore by himself
[40:33] let's save reading let's read the red
[40:35] and at the same life that was in this
[40:37] corn down here at the first stalk has
[40:40] ended up here in the ear in the grain
[40:42] just the same it just went on and on and
[40:44] on the same God was in the pillar of
[40:47] fire was in Christ Jesus the same one in
[40:50] Christ Jesus
[40:53] in you
[40:55] do we believe brother Brown was a
[40:57] prophet I just want to make sure we in
[40:59] the right I'm in the right congregation
[41:02] that's right God and you the hope of
[41:05] glory
[41:06] is that right the baptism of the Holy
[41:08] Spirit dwelling in the person now you
[41:10] become what sons of God he's just a
[41:13] portion of God and what is God God is
[41:16] deity all right now brother Brown in
[41:19] faith the substance 1951 he said deity
[41:21] it fell on the day of Pentecost it's
[41:24] still falling
[41:26] all right so if you say well that was
[41:28] for them well now it's for us
[41:30] if you receive the new birth you
[41:32] received deity you received not a second
[41:34] person of a trinity you receive the
[41:37] person of Jesus Christ
[41:39] in spirit form called the Holy Ghost all
[41:42] right the brother Ryan was talking about
[41:44] now he's moving up to at the spoken
[41:47] words original seat I want to hear what
[41:48] I you know I want to hear what what my
[41:52] father said about me
[41:54] all right I want to hear I don't want to
[41:55] I don't want to have to go to Instagram
[41:57] Facebook or anything and hear what
[41:59] somebody else said about me
[42:00] my father knows me better than anybody
[42:03] all right so this is where brother
[42:05] Branham says the Holy Spirit told him to
[42:09] pick up this pen and write and as sister
[42:12] clean and I were talking the other day
[42:13] he was so inspired he had to go back and
[42:16] read it again because he didn't even
[42:17] know what he read what he wrote that's
[42:19] how inspired that's how much the Holy
[42:21] Ghost took over and wrote this whole
[42:23] summation to me this is the summation of
[42:27] the Bride of Jesus Christ in the end
[42:29] time
[42:29] now here is what I'm trying to say to
[42:31] you the law of reproduction bringing
[42:34] forth of its kind Genesis 1 11. these
[42:37] last days true church Bride Comes To The
[42:39] Headstone so it's got to come to The
[42:41] Headstone all right we are headstone
[42:44] people
[42:45] all right we will be the Super Church
[42:48] you said boy we don't look like it now
[42:49] you're just not looking through the
[42:51] right set of eyes
[42:52] we are a super church because we are
[42:54] going in the Rapture if we're born again
[42:57] all that other group out there is not
[43:00] going in the rapture
[43:02] and they're going to have to stay in
[43:03] judgment
[43:05] you and I are not
[43:08] a super race
[43:10] as the nearest The Headstone all right
[43:12] now that's us going up the statue of
[43:14] perfect man
[43:15] even look they will be much like
[43:20] it's like him now what is the divine
[43:23] nature of God that's what we're looking
[43:24] at now this whole statue of perfect man
[43:26] this is the divine nature of God but
[43:28] it's now not to the divine nature of God
[43:30] that we can't get to it's the divine
[43:32] nature of God that we're required to
[43:34] have
[43:36] all right remember I read you long long
[43:38] time ago in Sherman like 20 something
[43:40] out of 130 we're on Earth 113.
[43:43] he said it's required
[43:46] these virtues are required
[43:49] they're required to what they're not
[43:51] required to be a a Christian you can get
[43:53] born again and stay a baby
[43:55] but who would want to who would want to
[43:58] somebody who's been in this message for
[43:59] 30 years and still be a baby
[44:05] I wouldn't
[44:07] I wouldn't want it I mean as much as
[44:09] trouble as Josh did give us uh he's not
[44:13] here right now
[44:14] I wouldn't want him to stay a baby
[44:16] I wanted to grow up and be his own self
[44:18] you know what he's the father now
[44:20] I want him to be that that's a desire
[44:22] it's for him to be a father and have his
[44:24] own
[44:25] have his own family and not be living
[44:28] with us praise the Lord so anyway
[44:30] y'all remember that young kids young
[44:33] adults
[44:34] it says leave and cleave
[44:37] they will be one
[44:38] they will be in this very image how are
[44:40] we going to be in the image of God if we
[44:42] don't look
[44:45] all right in the in the order to being
[44:49] united with him they will be one they
[44:52] will be the very manifestation of the
[44:54] word of the Living God now look this is
[44:56] the holy ghost telling the prophet to
[44:58] write to me and you so this is the Holy
[45:01] Ghost talking to me and you today this
[45:04] is your love letter from your father
[45:06] because the father and the Holy Ghost is
[45:08] the same person all right everybody with
[45:10] me then from a little group of the true
[45:13] seed of the word God will present Christ
[45:15] a beloved bride a virgin a version of
[45:18] his word and through them and by them
[45:20] now wait through them and by them
[45:25] all right so it's got to come through us
[45:27] the great mystery of godliness that
[45:29] comes to a group of people
[45:30] that were born in sin that didn't have a
[45:32] chance
[45:34] we'll be fulfilled all that has been
[45:36] promised promised for his word
[45:38] a virgin who
[45:39] man-made Creed or dog
[45:42] God had to send us a prophet he sent us
[45:45] a prophet not to change the Bible to
[45:47] make sure that we understood the Bible
[45:49] was written one way
[45:52] not 900 some different ways one way
[45:56] and we got away from that and I'll read
[45:58] it to you in just a few minutes
[45:59] when we start talking about Doctrine
[46:01] because listen everybody's got to have a
[46:03] Doctrine every Church brother Brian said
[46:05] you're not a church without a Doctrine
[46:06] all right so we gotta have a Doctrine
[46:08] The Word of Promise in himself like it
[46:11] wasn't Mary God himself
[46:14] made manifest he will act himself by his
[46:17] own Word of Promise so to fulfill all
[46:20] that's been written of him as he did
[46:22] when he came from the Virgin womb in
[46:24] other words Jesus fulfilled she's going
[46:26] to make so many hundred scriptures while
[46:27] he was here well that's what me and you
[46:29] were to do we're to fulfill how many
[46:31] scriptures we fulfilled my you can't
[46:33] even count how many that the Bride of
[46:35] Jesus Christ is already fulfilled and
[46:37] God and going to fulfill all right
[46:39] praise the Lord that's what makes us the
[46:41] word
[46:42] that's what makes us the word made flesh
[46:44] all right type of the spirit womb now so
[46:47] will the Virgin now accepting his word
[46:49] be unto me
[46:50] as thou has said though it was said by
[46:53] an Angel while yet was written word
[46:55] Isaiah 9 6. in other words Isaiah 9 6
[46:59] was written back in the Old Testament
[47:00] but an angel came to Mary and said
[47:03] you're going to have this child a virgin
[47:05] and then she said be it unto me
[47:07] according to that word all right they
[47:10] will love him love his and will have his
[47:12] potentials now we start talking about
[47:14] this word love and we're going to talk
[47:16] about brotherly kindness or Brotherly
[47:17] Love in just a few minutes that love is
[47:20] different that love is not lovey-dovey
[47:22] lovey dovey amen
[47:25] it's not
[47:26] filio love
[47:28] when you get to Agape Love and I'll read
[47:30] it to you this afternoon brother Ram
[47:32] talks about when you get to agape love
[47:35] everybody says well God is love God is
[47:37] love Yeah God's love but God is still a
[47:40] judge
[47:41] him he can't go past his word you have
[47:43] to stay in the confines of his word you
[47:45] get outside the word of God guess what
[47:47] you get you get judgment yes right and
[47:50] it ain't nice and it ain't pretty
[47:52] because you know what God Said in his
[47:54] Bible I hate
[47:57] oh you're quiet
[48:00] Revelations
[48:02] he said the Deeds of the nickelodeans
[48:04] which I hate
[48:07] huh God said oh wait a minute God's a
[48:11] jealous God
[48:12] wow this lovey-dovey person
[48:15] just love everybody Come As You Are
[48:20] I drove by Church coming up here and I'm
[48:22] not judging them I'm letting them judge
[48:23] yourself but the kids was running around
[48:25] it looked like it was school time I mean
[48:26] the Hell in the shorts out on their hats
[48:28] had on t-shirts I mean you know they
[48:30] were and they were going to church
[48:35] that's not godliness
[48:38] you and I are godliness all right
[48:41] they will love him love his and will
[48:43] have his potentials for he is their head
[48:45] and they are his subjects subject to his
[48:48] head the headship of Christ was his
[48:52] notice what Harmony Jesus never did
[48:55] anything until scene of the father or
[48:58] the father showed him first Harmony
[49:00] between God and Christ see
[49:04] now if you stop right there he said well
[49:05] okay
[49:07] brother Brown said Soul the bride
[49:10] what
[49:11] so will the bride have harmony with the
[49:14] father
[49:15] and Christ same person and he shows her
[49:19] his word of life he shows her and she
[49:22] receives it now remember this is the
[49:23] holy spirit writing
[49:25] to me and you
[49:26] nothing can harm her not even death for
[49:29] if the seed be planted the water will
[49:31] raise it up again amen then I got a
[49:33] great big Hallelujah he wrote that
[49:34] himself here is the secret the word is
[49:38] in the bride and the mind of Christ to
[49:40] know what he wants done with the word
[49:43] so when we come to Faith virtue
[49:45] knowledge Temperance patience that
[49:47] knowledge is what knowing what to do
[49:49] with the word of God not knowing how to
[49:52] show how smart we are
[49:56] somebody say Amen
[49:58] it don't puff you up
[50:00] that knowledge does not puff you up
[50:03] that knowledge will humble you that God
[50:05] was would come to a simple group of
[50:07] people
[50:08] and open the word of God to us
[50:11] and it'd be in our time and in our
[50:13] season see where brother Brandon was
[50:15] there there was a time and a season for
[50:17] them in that Pentecostal age but
[50:19] remember in spoken I mean in The Sixth
[50:22] Seal on questions and answers he said
[50:23] you're not getting this
[50:25] it's not for you
[50:27] in other words it was for us
[50:30] they heard the sound
[50:33] but they didn't understand
[50:36] the Bible says if the trumpet makes a
[50:38] what uncertain sound
[50:41] because remember that's the only way
[50:43] they can communicate back in the Old
[50:44] Testament
[50:46] if you had an army way over here and you
[50:48] were part of the West Wing of the army
[50:50] that wasn't any cell phones and it
[50:53] wasn't even the time to do smoke signals
[50:56] you blew a trumpet and whatever the
[50:58] sound of that trumpet was Retreat charge
[51:00] whatever more you listen to that sound
[51:03] of that trumpet and if the trumpeter
[51:06] gave a wrong sound guess what if it said
[51:08] retreat
[51:10] and the sound was you go forward
[51:13] you'd be in bad shape well that's what's
[51:14] happened to the word of God the word of
[51:17] God came through the trumpet called the
[51:19] Lord Jesus Christ amen the trumpet
[51:22] and then man has what changed the notes
[51:26] come on man has changed the nose God
[51:28] didn't change the notes man changed the
[51:30] notes so it made an uncertain sound
[51:32] during the church ages but now in the
[51:34] end time right here he's telling us he's
[51:36] bringing it back Center
[51:38] he's bringing it back so that we can
[51:39] understand it he's bringing it back so
[51:41] that we can not be different
[51:45] but be different
[51:48] the word is in the bride and the mind of
[51:51] Christ who know what he wants done with
[51:52] the word and she does it in his name
[51:57] she has thus saith the Lord then it's
[52:00] germatized so the Holy Spirit Waters it
[52:02] until it's grown and serves its purpose
[52:04] they do only his will amen I'll believe
[52:07] that
[52:08] no one can persuade them different
[52:11] now we've been talking about godliness
[52:13] and we've been talking about patients
[52:15] and all the different things it's going
[52:16] to take every bit of that though for us
[52:19] to as we were talking about the other
[52:20] day about the the sore of the seed
[52:22] falling into different ground well
[52:25] that's your ground today today you
[52:28] either brought Stony thorny ground you
[52:30] either got a in a fight with your
[52:32] girlfriend
[52:34] wife husband
[52:37] who else monument and you brought some
[52:40] Stony ground
[52:41] in here
[52:43] you brought some rocks hard rocks in
[52:47] this building but some of you brought
[52:49] good ground
[52:50] some of you brought good ground and that
[52:52] seed's gonna fall in that good ground
[52:53] and it's going to sprout up and it's
[52:55] going to give you Revelation and it's
[52:57] going to help you through amen so let's
[52:59] get rid of the Stony places let's get
[53:00] rid of the thorny places all right
[53:02] that and it's you that it's you that
[53:05] brings the dirt in here
[53:08] hello somebody it's you that brings it
[53:10] in here all right
[53:12] they have thus said the Lord or they
[53:13] will keep still then they will do the
[53:16] works of God for it is himself and them
[53:19] continuing his word to fulfill as he did
[53:22] completely in his day
[53:25] in other words it's going to be in this
[53:26] day all things when he was here he did
[53:29] not complete all
[53:30] though when he was here
[53:33] fruit was not time yet
[53:35] why the bride wasn't on Earth
[53:37] his natural body was on Earth but his
[53:39] spiritual body was not here
[53:42] his spiritual body only started on the
[53:44] day of Pentecost 11 days after he
[53:46] ascended
[53:49] everybody with me so that's why the Holy
[53:52] Ghost said to me and you that's not a
[53:55] third person second person that's not
[53:57] even me I'm reading exactly what the
[54:00] Holy Ghost told
[54:01] the prophet of God to write to tell you
[54:03] all right
[54:05] to the doctrine which is according to
[54:07] Godliness so there is a doctrine that we
[54:09] must be under
[54:11] to take us to Godliness and to brotherly
[54:14] kindness because that's the two tough
[54:15] ones because they're right up here at
[54:16] the very top all right I got this off
[54:20] the internet so again Jeremiah must be
[54:22] true all right what is a Doctrine in
[54:25] simple terms
[54:28] Britannica dictionary
[54:30] definition of Doctrine a set of ideas or
[54:33] beliefs that are taught
[54:35] or they are believed to be true all
[54:39] right so now look
[54:41] we all have a Doctrine did you know that
[54:43] Jesus had a Doctrine
[54:45] what was Jesus's first Doctrine go look
[54:47] there
[54:48] what was Jesus's first Doctrine brother
[54:50] Ryan said it many many times
[54:52] Jesus's first Doctrine out of his mouth
[54:54] was you must be born again not you need
[54:58] to be or you might can you must be born
[55:01] again
[55:02] so brother Ram in 1961 says now God
[55:04] bless his word and I want to take the
[55:07] subject this morning of Jesus's first
[55:08] Doctrine and the first doctrine of Jesus
[55:11] was you must be born again
[55:13] that was his first Doctrine now in a way
[55:16] of Sunday school so that I won't preach
[55:18] and horse myself up for tonight I
[55:20] thought in my heart that this is
[55:21] something that seems puzzling watch this
[55:23] puzzling
[55:25] the new birth
[55:27] and how to get it
[55:30] brother mom said it was most ill top
[55:32] subject and I believe it still is the
[55:34] most ill-taught subject
[55:36] it's not that you come in and sit down
[55:37] in a message Church
[55:42] you got to know Jesus Christ when you
[55:45] know Jesus Christ he'll bring you into
[55:46] the church you won't have to be begged
[55:49] poor prodded or or
[55:52] Hawk Titan drug in here
[55:54] right
[55:55] you'll come to your own free will
[55:56] because you know what you come to talk
[55:57] to your father your real father
[56:02] he said I thought it would be good this
[56:04] morning if we just search this subject
[56:06] clear it out and that's the first
[56:08] beginning you must be born again it's a
[56:09] very deep one
[56:11] and we find out that there are so many
[56:13] different meanings that people put to it
[56:16] nearly all churches say You must be born
[56:18] again all right all churches say You
[56:20] must be born again all right now but not
[56:23] any church outside the message of the
[56:25] hour that I know of teaches that once
[56:28] you get born again that gets you started
[56:31] not finishes you
[56:34] it's not once saved always saved it's
[56:37] once Born Again always born again
[56:41] you can't get unborn again
[56:43] all right like I said before last Sunday
[56:45] remember you can be saved and not born
[56:47] again
[56:49] but you can't be born again and not get
[56:51] saved
[56:51] you got to come through that
[56:53] but you can stop yourself at saved
[56:55] believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and
[56:57] thou shalt be saved that's not the new
[56:59] birth
[57:01] don't get quiet on me that's not the new
[57:03] birth that yes you started in
[57:05] justification
[57:07] saved Sanctified and filled with the
[57:10] Holy Ghost is what this church doctrine
[57:11] believes in
[57:15] we find there's so many different
[57:16] meanings that people put to nearly all
[57:18] churches say You must be born again but
[57:20] each one has their different
[57:21] interpretations to that what it means to
[57:24] be born again I might go to the
[57:26] Methodist
[57:27] church this morning they say we believe
[57:29] this you must be born again how do you
[57:31] interpret it
[57:32] I go to the Baptist Church you believe
[57:33] you must be born again how do you
[57:35] interpret it and I will go to each
[57:37] church and we'd find if we went to all
[57:40] 900 different denominational churches
[57:42] there'd be 900 different interpretations
[57:47] so seeing that there are so many
[57:49] different interpretations and yet a
[57:51] Bible Doctrine
[57:54] there must be and is a truth somewhere
[57:58] same way with us our Doctrine in this
[58:01] church is you must be born again you
[58:02] must be justified Sanctified and filled
[58:05] with the Holy Ghost to receive the new
[58:08] birth because you can have the Holy
[58:10] Ghost on your flesh and in your spirit
[58:12] realm and die and go to hell you can be
[58:15] just as black inside as the Asus page
[58:18] amen
[58:20] that's what anointed ones is you better
[58:22] know that you know that you know that
[58:24] when that unclean Spirit goes out he
[58:25] stays out
[58:27] you seal that thing up so nothing can
[58:29] get in and nothing can get out
[58:33] not just believe the message or
[58:36] believe God sent a prophet or free
[58:38] brother Dale or Breathe by the way and
[58:40] we believe
[58:42] what do you believe
[58:45] I tell you what you're going to prove
[58:46] what you believe
[58:48] regardless it's like I said many many
[58:50] times before you whatever's inside of
[58:53] you is going to come out
[58:54] you can suppress it years and years and
[58:57] years but all of a sudden it's going to
[58:59] pop its ugly head up or it's going to
[59:00] pop its real good head up one of the two
[59:02] so restoration of the Bride tree brother
[59:04] Ryan was talking about the Palm worm
[59:06] canker worm and all the different worms
[59:08] that was eating this tree down but I
[59:10] watched what they said this little fella
[59:12] started to destroy destroyed what canker
[59:14] worm got to bark Watch what it did began
[59:17] to destroy the bark what did it do it
[59:19] made a natural church for a spiritual
[59:21] church
[59:22] and that's what we have out here we have
[59:24] a natural Church they go to church they
[59:26] do good they give the missions they pay
[59:28] their tithe most of the time they do
[59:30] good work
[59:31] but that's not what all God wants he
[59:34] wants a holy life and something to go
[59:37] with that all right he wants us to be in
[59:40] his very nature
[59:41] it made a natural church for a spiritual
[59:44] church yes sir it took away the true
[59:48] wake up
[59:52] he took away the true and give it a
[59:54] false who's he
[59:56] God didn't
[59:57] Satan did
[59:59] the fruit the Pomer wore meat the leaf
[1:00:01] the locus eat now the bark the covering
[1:00:03] the religion the doctrine the doctrine
[1:00:06] the canker worm God where did that first
[1:00:08] Doctrine come from outside of the Bible
[1:00:10] now Jesus's first Doctrine was you must
[1:00:12] be born again that's in the Bible all
[1:00:15] right but outside the Bible who started
[1:00:18] their own Doctrine was the same guy that
[1:00:20] stood in the Garden of Eden and put that
[1:00:22] word not in there
[1:00:23] God said You shall surely die he said
[1:00:26] You shall not surely die
[1:00:29] you historians you know where it came
[1:00:31] from from Rome exactly where it started
[1:00:33] there they started accepting dogmas why
[1:00:37] did you put that in there by the way our
[1:00:39] Doctrine has got to be that we go up
[1:00:42] that statue of perfect man that we come
[1:00:45] to the love of God and that the Holy
[1:00:47] Spirit seals us as a unit
[1:00:49] not just come in and sit down and and
[1:00:52] and you know suck on our thumbs and and
[1:00:55] eat our uh eat our uh green Pete mashed
[1:00:59] up green peas and wow no I like meat
[1:01:03] I got me a pork steak I'm gonna eat just
[1:01:05] here in a few minutes you know why my
[1:01:07] teeth will allow me to do that
[1:01:10] even the ones that are false right now
[1:01:12] so
[1:01:13] but you know why we're meat eaters
[1:01:17] and even in the spiritual realm we're
[1:01:19] meat eaters we're eagles eagles eat meat
[1:01:21] Eagles does not drink milk
[1:01:24] eagles eat meat
[1:01:25] the baby eagle does not start drinking
[1:01:27] milk it's only one of the four beasts it
[1:01:29] doesn't all them four beasts three of
[1:01:31] them start with drinking milk the eagle
[1:01:33] starts with what Mama chewing up the big
[1:01:36] pieces and putting them
[1:01:38] in the beak in the mouth of the baby
[1:01:41] eagles then guess what that baby eagle
[1:01:43] you don't see a 40 pound baby eagle in a
[1:01:46] nest I promise you that Mom doesn't
[1:01:48] kicked him out
[1:01:49] so that's what mommy Eagles done or
[1:01:51] daddy Eagle he done kicked us out and
[1:01:53] we're gonna have to fly on our own all
[1:01:56] right so we got to have a Doctrine
[1:01:59] though and our Doctrine is we must be
[1:02:02] mature Christians somebody
[1:02:04] in this world is going to be a mature
[1:02:07] Church a mature Christian that knows
[1:02:10] what God wants done that goes and reads
[1:02:12] that and says father that ain't nothing
[1:02:14] but the truth
[1:02:16] you you told us you picked your you
[1:02:19] picked the pen up and buy an anointing
[1:02:21] you wrote something on a piece of paper
[1:02:24] with a hand of a prophet and he read it
[1:02:27] to us
[1:02:28] and now what our responsibility is to
[1:02:31] live it
[1:02:34] pum Warren Caterpillar
[1:02:36] if it so happens that you your church
[1:02:38] doesn't believe or you don't believe
[1:02:40] just the things we speak of in our
[1:02:42] church doctrine we trusted it will be no
[1:02:45] means bringing the fence
[1:02:47] because the very first step to a
[1:02:49] successful Christianity and to show that
[1:02:52] man has received the Holy Spirit is
[1:02:54] humility
[1:02:55] real god-given humility
[1:02:58] that it must be given humbly
[1:03:02] but yet a church without a Doctrine
[1:03:04] uh but yet we're not supposed to be
[1:03:07] jellyfish we're not supposed to just
[1:03:09] roll over and play dead
[1:03:10] we're supposed to what what Paul tell us
[1:03:12] we're supposed to give a reason of the
[1:03:14] hope that lies within us not that
[1:03:16] brother Branham said I want you to be
[1:03:18] able to say I say
[1:03:20] I don't cut my hair because the Bible
[1:03:22] says not because the prophet told me I
[1:03:24] don't drink because
[1:03:27] the prophet said it
[1:03:30] he didn't come to bring us that he come
[1:03:32] to sharpen our pencil
[1:03:36] he didn't change the way to be born
[1:03:37] again he was exactly the same way Paul
[1:03:40] and Peter and James and John all
[1:03:42] preached it in the first church age they
[1:03:44] preach you must be born again
[1:03:47] so but a church without a Doctrine is
[1:03:49] like a jellyfish it has no backbone so
[1:03:52] our church with the backbone believes
[1:03:54] that you got to be a mature Christian
[1:03:56] for God to be able to use you a hundred
[1:03:58] percent you can bring forth you can
[1:04:01] bring forth 30 if you want to
[1:04:03] you can bring forth 60 if you want to or
[1:04:06] you can bring forth a hundred if you
[1:04:07] want to all right
[1:04:10] so we've got to have backbone in it and
[1:04:13] not also backbone but teeth
[1:04:16] because the Church of God must eat the
[1:04:19] bread of life
[1:04:21] Romans 1 16 for I am not ashamed of the
[1:04:23] gospel of Christ for it is the power of
[1:04:26] God and the Salvation to everyone
[1:04:28] that believeth
[1:04:32] how many times you talk to people about
[1:04:33] the Lord during the week
[1:04:36] how many times do people wonder by your
[1:04:39] actions if you know who the Lord is
[1:04:40] during the week
[1:04:44] hmm
[1:04:45] you'd be silent all you want to that's
[1:04:47] okay think about that though
[1:04:50] Genesis 1 26 is
[1:04:52] God said let us make man our own image
[1:04:54] so
[1:04:55] he's developing something made in His
[1:04:58] image
[1:04:58] and in his likeness
[1:05:00] now we're made in the image of Samuel
[1:05:03] and Peggy Dale me Terrence Anna all
[1:05:06] right all right we have their DNA we
[1:05:08] have their genetics right so we're made
[1:05:11] in there in their image and our likeness
[1:05:13] and we we walk like them
[1:05:15] we talk like them
[1:05:19] but that's our natural birth
[1:05:23] our spiritual birth we're not supposed
[1:05:25] to walk by natural anymore we're
[1:05:26] supposed to walk by the spirit
[1:05:28] which is a different walk
[1:05:30] we're supposed to walk like this image
[1:05:32] tells us to walk that's why this Genesis
[1:05:34] 1 26 is so important because that's your
[1:05:37] new birth
[1:05:38] so what comes to your new birth the
[1:05:40] image of God the image that God saw of
[1:05:42] you before the foundation of the world
[1:05:43] which he loved so much
[1:05:46] he brought this one together with this
[1:05:47] one and this one with this one this one
[1:05:49] listen to get you here
[1:05:50] and now what the prophet of God said
[1:05:52] to get your DNA here your genetics here
[1:05:55] so that he can work on you in his
[1:05:59] likeness
[1:06:00] by the new birth
[1:06:03] so God created man his own image this is
[1:06:05] where it was supposed to be this is
[1:06:07] where it was supposed to come we were
[1:06:08] supposed to come this way not by sex but
[1:06:10] by Spoken Word we were not to come by uh
[1:06:14] sorrow and heartaches and trials and and
[1:06:17] and hurts and tribulations and all that
[1:06:19] stuff we weren't we weren't originally
[1:06:21] made for that
[1:06:24] hey
[1:06:26] but to fulfill the plan of God he let it
[1:06:28] happen
[1:06:29] and that tore us away from God that took
[1:06:31] us away from this image and put us in a
[1:06:33] human image but God said hey don't worry
[1:06:36] I haven't left you
[1:06:38] I'm gonna come back in the image of my
[1:06:41] father Hallelujah I'm gonna come in the
[1:06:44] image of my father because I got all
[1:06:46] these kids inside of me that sexually
[1:06:49] I'm not going to get out because that's
[1:06:51] what's killing you already no I'm gonna
[1:06:53] come as the woman's seed
[1:06:56] come on I'm going to come as a woman
[1:06:58] seed by my father
[1:07:01] and I'm gonna make you a way to get back
[1:07:03] to this
[1:07:04] buy the new birth
[1:07:07] male and female created he them
[1:07:10] and what happened
[1:07:11] it's a new birth
[1:07:13] that's what happened
[1:07:14] that image that God saw before the
[1:07:17] foundation world that Eternal image of
[1:07:19] you came to you
[1:07:21] and as we were talking it vulcanized
[1:07:25] with you
[1:07:27] and you can't tear it apart
[1:07:30] but now can it can rubber vulcanize with
[1:07:32] rocks nope
[1:07:34] rubber has to vulcanized with rubber you
[1:07:37] have to have a desire in your heart that
[1:07:38] God changed your heart
[1:07:41] remember we were born with a Stony heart
[1:07:43] according to Ezekiel and he had to give
[1:07:45] us a new heart which is not the new
[1:07:47] birth he gave us a new heart which was
[1:07:49] pliable so that God can as the master
[1:07:52] Potter he can throw us on the wheel and
[1:07:54] make another image
[1:07:56] but you can't take a rock I've watched
[1:07:59] them do Pottery all my life I live
[1:08:01] around pottery
[1:08:03] they never have took a rock and put it
[1:08:05] on that wheel turned it on and here they
[1:08:07] go
[1:08:09] now it's still a rock
[1:08:11] but you take that you take that pliable
[1:08:13] clay
[1:08:16] throw it on that wheel and the first
[1:08:17] thing you do you get a little water and
[1:08:19] you start like this and you think man
[1:08:21] there's no way that's going to be a five
[1:08:24] gallon jar
[1:08:26] because there's only a clump about like
[1:08:28] this there's no way you're gonna act
[1:08:31] like God
[1:08:33] but the Potter has a different story The
[1:08:36] Potter has in an image in his mind well
[1:08:39] praise the Lord stick your hand in Lord
[1:08:42] so that's the first thing they do they
[1:08:44] stick their hand in
[1:08:45] they go down so far but now Sister
[1:08:47] Regina they don't go so far to where
[1:08:49] they don't mess the bass up
[1:08:53] somebody get this they don't mess the
[1:08:56] base up base stays the same
[1:08:58] then he comes like this and he brings
[1:09:01] that and if it comes in and out he just
[1:09:03] moves it with his hand
[1:09:05] get some more water
[1:09:06] and they wash by the water of the word
[1:09:07] he gets the most water amen and he puts
[1:09:11] that thing and he makes it pliable
[1:09:14] and man it is amazing what they can make
[1:09:16] it is amazing what you can get from a
[1:09:19] clump of clay well listen if man can do
[1:09:22] that what about God what about a Godly
[1:09:25] image that we're supposed to be in give
[1:09:27] him
[1:09:28] okay
[1:09:30] give him your clay and let him mold you
[1:09:33] into a Godly image man that'd make those
[1:09:36] strawberry jars and then make it and
[1:09:38] make the lip and then even make the lip
[1:09:40] part that would go out to where the
[1:09:42] water would flow right through that one
[1:09:43] part all while that thing's spinning and
[1:09:46] guess who's spinning the wheel they are
[1:09:49] full control
[1:09:52] you thank you and you know what if you
[1:09:54] spin that thing too fast
[1:09:56] if it starts wobbling now well I have
[1:09:58] watched some Potters if and they're all
[1:10:00] kin to Terence and they um
[1:10:03] they they start and start over here and
[1:10:06] they put too much pressure and they get
[1:10:07] when he gets to wobbling it falls off
[1:10:09] that's his kinfo
[1:10:13] guess what they have to do though
[1:10:15] They Don't Throw the Clay Away thank God
[1:10:18] for that song They Don't Throw the Clay
[1:10:20] Away he just goes right back and says
[1:10:22] hey you you missed that first trial up
[1:10:24] buddy we're gonna try you again we're
[1:10:25] gonna put you on the wheel we didn't
[1:10:27] give you enough water in other words you
[1:10:29] you might have got under the pressure
[1:10:30] too much and you got a little wobbly
[1:10:34] well praise God
[1:10:36] so that Godly image only comes from God
[1:10:38] but he comes through you you've got to
[1:10:40] be the one that lives it
[1:10:42] you've got to be the one that shows this
[1:10:44] godliness so is it attainable yes it's
[1:10:47] attainable
[1:10:48] the Bible talks about Godless the word
[1:10:51] Theos
[1:10:52] which is a deity so here we go back to
[1:10:54] the deity part
[1:10:56] whatever can in respect be likened unto
[1:10:59] God or resemble him
[1:11:01] in any way
[1:11:03] God's representative or vice region
[1:11:06] magistrates and judges
[1:11:07] second Timothy 3 verse 11 says
[1:11:09] persecution afflictions which came unto
[1:11:12] me in Antioch and Iconium and a live
[1:11:13] stream what persecutions I endured so
[1:11:16] guess what you got to endure some
[1:11:18] persecution
[1:11:22] but I didn't finish my story
[1:11:24] you know what happens when you get
[1:11:25] finished with the pot they're not
[1:11:27] finished with it you can't put anything
[1:11:29] in it at the moment
[1:11:31] come on somebody
[1:11:33] fill it up with water and it and it be
[1:11:35] just sitting on the wheel it's gonna go
[1:11:41] why because they hadn't been put in Fire
[1:11:43] yet
[1:11:45] it hadn't been putting fire yet and we
[1:11:47] used to unload them things
[1:11:49] you'd have to put on big old gloves your
[1:11:52] tennis shoes would stick to the floor
[1:11:53] that's how hot that thing got but you
[1:11:55] know what you put those pots in and you
[1:11:57] just really I mean boy Joe Craven would
[1:12:00] Bust Your Hide if you broke one of them
[1:12:01] things because that was a dollar and
[1:12:03] fifty cents out of his pocket probably
[1:12:05] out of yours too
[1:12:06] but we set them things in there one at a
[1:12:08] time and you'd stack them up one upside
[1:12:10] down one or the other in this kill and
[1:12:13] you walked in the ovens on both sides
[1:12:14] right here you fill that thing up and
[1:12:16] then you walk your way out to the end
[1:12:17] and you seal it up I'll seal it up
[1:12:20] then you turn the heat on well when uh
[1:12:23] he got when he got finished
[1:12:25] you didn't have to go in there be so
[1:12:26] gentle you had to be a little bit but
[1:12:27] not so gentle you could grab two of it
[1:12:29] four at a time
[1:12:31] because why then they had hardened into
[1:12:33] a good Christian
[1:12:35] that
[1:12:37] liability had become what the Potter
[1:12:40] wanted it to be not just something
[1:12:42] that's wishy-washy all the way back and
[1:12:44] forth and back and forth no something
[1:12:46] that can be used
[1:12:49] Joe Craven made Millions selling them
[1:12:51] things
[1:12:54] as Bob sits Wednesday ten thousand
[1:12:57] whirls that's what your Soul's worth not
[1:12:59] just one
[1:13:00] one would be good enough ten thousand
[1:13:03] Worlds the prophet of God tells us
[1:13:06] persecution convictions
[1:13:08] ovens
[1:13:10] trials tribulations
[1:13:12] but out of them all
[1:13:15] the Lord delivered me yea and all that
[1:13:18] will live Godly in Christ Jesus shall
[1:13:21] suffer
[1:13:22] persecution
[1:13:23] but evil men and seducers shall wax
[1:13:26] worse and worse deceiving and being
[1:13:28] deceived we know that's the end time all
[1:13:30] right so we can live godliness we can be
[1:13:33] Godly
[1:13:34] as I said before you think I'm nothing
[1:13:37] your sisters you're the greatest
[1:13:39] testimony I mean when I walk into
[1:13:41] Walmart with my tennis shoes and my blue
[1:13:43] jeans and and they don't have holes in
[1:13:45] them where's Dana they don't have holes
[1:13:47] in them
[1:13:49] we used to send them well Mama used to
[1:13:51] throw them away if we were called the
[1:13:52] brother Kylie
[1:13:53] because it right we caught with holes in
[1:13:56] our britches uh we got holes in our
[1:13:58] britches all right
[1:13:59] hey
[1:14:03] now they bombed for a hundred dollars a
[1:14:05] piece with holes in them I should have
[1:14:07] kept all mine and sold them
[1:14:13] this world is not my home
[1:14:17] look at the craziness though how they're
[1:14:20] dressing
[1:14:23] but see we've we've come out of that
[1:14:27] we don't have to go to salon
[1:14:30] and get our hair done
[1:14:32] and our nails done well some of y'all do
[1:14:35] nails done
[1:14:37] we don't have to go and you know open up
[1:14:40] the cabinet and then you got like five
[1:14:42] thousand dollars worth of Mac Factor all
[1:14:44] different shades and sizes and in that
[1:14:47] Max Factor Max Factor yeah open up thank
[1:14:50] you open up what did I say
[1:14:53] oh sorry anyway
[1:14:57] I have my coach with me today
[1:15:00] but
[1:15:01] you don't have that
[1:15:03] praise God
[1:15:05] I always I always said I said you look
[1:15:07] at the world and there's some beautiful
[1:15:08] girls in the world but they're all made
[1:15:09] up
[1:15:11] I'd hate to see Dolly Parton at seven
[1:15:12] o'clock in the morning
[1:15:17] he'd be like that song we played the
[1:15:19] other day about side by side there was
[1:15:21] more the woman on the chair than it was
[1:15:23] in the bed because she took her eye out
[1:15:24] she took her hair date out shook her leg
[1:15:26] off took her wig off and her teeth out
[1:15:28] yeah
[1:15:30] well that's what the world looks like to
[1:15:32] us though they want to be so beautified
[1:15:34] and so put together talk to me it's ugly
[1:15:37] and you know who you know it's worth
[1:15:40] maybe I'll wake up some of y'all are
[1:15:42] still asleep
[1:15:44] but that's what the world looks at and
[1:15:45] says well that's beautiful
[1:15:47] I don't it's ugly
[1:15:50] because it's like Daddy always said you
[1:15:52] can paint a barn
[1:15:54] you can paint an old barn with fresh red
[1:15:56] paint but the old barn is still
[1:15:58] underneath that now that's filming your
[1:16:01] pastor now
[1:16:02] he said that for years
[1:16:05] but praise God listen we've been come
[1:16:07] we've lifted out of that amen we don't
[1:16:10] have to do that we don't have to go by
[1:16:12] the fashion of the world
[1:16:16] I'll give myself a hand clap
[1:16:20] if you love the world and the things of
[1:16:22] this world the love of God is not in you
[1:16:24] I didn't say that the father said that
[1:16:31] we have to be in the world
[1:16:33] we have to rub shoulders with the world
[1:16:35] but remember I read you that scripture
[1:16:37] the other day in Saint John 17 Jesus did
[1:16:40] not say I'm going to take you out of
[1:16:42] this world and put you in a bubble
[1:16:44] he said father
[1:16:47] they're in this world
[1:16:49] so I'm going to pray for him
[1:16:51] not that you take them out of the world
[1:16:53] but that you protect them from the world
[1:16:56] that's what our protection is
[1:16:58] from the word of God
[1:17:01] I mean you ever thought about that I
[1:17:03] mean thank God that that our sisters
[1:17:04] don't have to buy 500 of worth of Mary
[1:17:07] Kay and Lord you know I work for the
[1:17:09] Post Office and it that thing comes in
[1:17:11] on a monthly plan I think you know it's
[1:17:13] Mary Kay comes in and she's got like 50
[1:17:16] packages and I'm like man how much is in
[1:17:19] packages they could be 50 25 150 brother
[1:17:22] John praise God sister Alicia is not on
[1:17:25] that list
[1:17:26] hey man see because that's not on
[1:17:34] Mary Kate
[1:17:36] if you buy me a k that's your business
[1:17:40] but my wife don't need it she's
[1:17:42] beautiful from the inside out and that's
[1:17:44] all I worry about
[1:17:49] it I was looking at her the other day
[1:17:50] she's so pretty
[1:17:53] you know brother Brown told us
[1:17:54] he said we'd all get old
[1:17:57] he said you'd remember when your
[1:17:59] shoulders was all
[1:18:00] squared you know
[1:18:02] and uh
[1:18:04] your wife was all
[1:18:06] beautiful
[1:18:07] fresh
[1:18:10] he said but when you get older
[1:18:12] you still need to see that
[1:18:15] the beauty that comes from within first
[1:18:19] amen
[1:18:20] praise God
[1:18:23] that's why we were talking the other day
[1:18:25] about love
[1:18:27] there's a lot of people in this world do
[1:18:29] not know they say I love this well I do
[1:18:31] I use this I said I love to hunt
[1:18:32] Jeremiah I love to hunt well now
[1:18:37] love is compared to what
[1:18:40] okay
[1:18:42] compared to the love of God if I hunt if
[1:18:44] I well church is going on I feel a
[1:18:47] little different
[1:18:49] so let's continue on but praise God that
[1:18:50] we don't
[1:18:51] we don't act like the world
[1:18:53] we don't even think like the world
[1:18:56] right Regina thank you Jesus
[1:18:59] I mean if I had to act that way to make
[1:19:01] it I'm sorry
[1:19:03] just wouldn't make it
[1:19:07] let's talk about brotherly kindness well
[1:19:09] well see then we're on the path to
[1:19:10] Godliness all of us your sisters your
[1:19:12] brothers even the brothers you know you
[1:19:14] don't have to worry about it you don't
[1:19:15] have to worry about your liquor bill or
[1:19:17] your tax bill they're going to eat at a
[1:19:19] restaurant man it costs still
[1:19:21] start bro John it costs 20 or 30 dollars
[1:19:24] a piece almost now to eat a meal
[1:19:27] and found it in your budget you're in
[1:19:28] trouble
[1:19:29] but what about them people sit and drink
[1:19:31] three four five drinks before the meal
[1:19:35] thank God that's not on my plan
[1:19:39] you know why it goes number one is
[1:19:41] stupid
[1:19:42] number two it's not my desire I don't
[1:19:44] care if they go up to fifty dollars a
[1:19:45] drink what does it matter to me
[1:19:47] I don't care if they go up to fifty
[1:19:49] dollars for a case of beer who cares
[1:19:52] see what you've taken yourself you say
[1:19:54] well that's kind of little
[1:19:56] little as much
[1:19:58] when God is in it
[1:20:00] labor not for wealth of Fame there's a
[1:20:03] crown and you can win it
[1:20:05] will go in Jesus name Broadway kindness
[1:20:08] let's talk about this just for a second
[1:20:09] and we'll then we'll close for the
[1:20:11] afternoon everybody all right
[1:20:14] y'all get you nap in between services
[1:20:16] are y'all gonna be in trouble this
[1:20:18] afternoon
[1:20:19] second Peter 1-5 besides this in other
[1:20:21] words besides the new birth besides
[1:20:24] being born again besides the beginning
[1:20:26] to act like God
[1:20:28] giving all diligence add to your faith
[1:20:31] first Universe your knowledge and
[1:20:32] knowledge Temperance Temperance patience
[1:20:34] patience godliness and the godliness
[1:20:36] we've come now to brotherly kindness and
[1:20:38] I'm going to tell you something this is
[1:20:40] going to get tough
[1:20:42] all these other things are inward
[1:20:46] okay
[1:20:48] all the faith is mine
[1:20:51] virtue is mine but you give it out but
[1:20:54] it's mine
[1:20:55] knowledge
[1:20:56] Temperance patience
[1:20:59] godliness is what's inside
[1:21:01] but now brotherly kindness is something
[1:21:03] you got to give to somebody else
[1:21:06] brother kindness is something you got to
[1:21:07] give to somebody else
[1:21:08] because you gotta love your neighbor
[1:21:12] the same as you do yourself
[1:21:16] well get quiet because it's going to be
[1:21:18] in just here in just a few minutes
[1:21:20] you know Jesus said one time he said
[1:21:22] while you're praying
[1:21:25] while you stand praying
[1:21:27] forgive
[1:21:30] he said because if you don't
[1:21:32] you won't be forgiven of what you're
[1:21:34] praying for
[1:21:36] wow hmm
[1:21:39] Philadelphia brotherly kindness that's
[1:21:41] the word for Brotherly Love brotherly
[1:21:43] kindness It's Love of brothers or
[1:21:44] sisters Brotherly Love in the New
[1:21:46] Testament it's a love which Christians
[1:21:48] cherish for each other
[1:21:49] as Brethren and we know that's not the
[1:21:52] same love for a wife
[1:21:54] that's feel your love agape love is
[1:21:57] brotherly love everybody with me it's
[1:21:58] supposed to be anyway sometimes we get
[1:22:00] it all convoluted and it all comes down
[1:22:02] to something else
[1:22:04] all right so Philadelphia love his
[1:22:06] Brethren loving brothers and sisters
[1:22:08] look in a broader sense love me one like
[1:22:10] a brother love me one as brother Donnie
[1:22:12] always said my family
[1:22:15] this is your family
[1:22:17] and and praise God if your family is
[1:22:19] physically sitting here
[1:22:21] but if your family's not physically
[1:22:23] sitting here this is your family I'm
[1:22:25] talking about blood all right this is
[1:22:27] your family
[1:22:28] this is the one you're gonna spend
[1:22:30] eternity with not that one
[1:22:33] all right
[1:22:34] now look God is love but love typically
[1:22:38] produces obedience now watch
[1:22:41] I thought I'd throw this in here this is
[1:22:42] kind of a few quotes from from a few
[1:22:45] places but God is love now God is love
[1:22:47] agape love right God is not feeling your
[1:22:49] love God can't feel your love
[1:22:54] God can't lust
[1:22:56] God can't have filial love God is agape
[1:22:58] love and that's it
[1:23:00] God is love but love typically produces
[1:23:03] obedience now look and for all who
[1:23:05] refuse to repent and believe in Christ
[1:23:07] they receive Justice
[1:23:09] which is true
[1:23:11] for those who do trust in Christ they
[1:23:14] receive what they don't deserve called
[1:23:17] Grace
[1:23:18] and have withheld what they really did
[1:23:21] deserve Mercy which side are you on do
[1:23:25] you have eternal life or do you still
[1:23:26] have the wrath of God abiding on you
[1:23:30] you know if you're born again today the
[1:23:31] wrath of God will never touch you
[1:23:34] if you're not born again today you are
[1:23:36] under the wrath of God all right
[1:23:39] I'm just telling you what the Bible says
[1:23:42] Matthew 24 12 says and because iniquity
[1:23:45] shall abound what is Iniquity no one to
[1:23:47] do better and you don't
[1:23:49] or knowing to do something then you
[1:23:50] don't do it and because iniquity shall
[1:23:53] abound the love of many shall wax cold
[1:23:56] have you not seen that in this end time
[1:23:59] it's all selfies
[1:24:01] and we'll get to that in just a second
[1:24:03] maybe real quick First Peter 1 22 says
[1:24:05] seeing you have purified your souls
[1:24:07] Sauls
[1:24:09] and obeying the truth through the spirit
[1:24:10] unto unfeign or love that you can't
[1:24:13] contain
[1:24:15] unfeigned love of the brethren
[1:24:18] see that you love one another with a
[1:24:20] pure heart fervently
[1:24:23] being born again
[1:24:26] not of corruptible seed or Incorruptible
[1:24:28] by the word of God which liveth in the
[1:24:29] Bible forever
[1:24:31] that word fervently sincere
[1:24:33] undistinguished
[1:24:35] brother I'm saying You must be born
[1:24:36] again
[1:24:38] said anything had a beginning had an end
[1:24:39] so see every love had a beginning except
[1:24:42] agape love
[1:24:44] anybody with me
[1:24:46] because it listen if God Loved You at
[1:24:48] the beginning he can't unlove you
[1:24:50] anywhere else
[1:24:52] because he can't change his mind
[1:24:54] all right so we've got to get up into
[1:24:56] agape love
[1:24:58] he led us and allowed us through Adam
[1:25:00] and Eve and what they did he allowed
[1:25:02] filial love and for us to have love for
[1:25:05] our wife love for our but still even
[1:25:07] feel your love has
[1:25:10] it has like levels
[1:25:13] you can't let I can't I don't love
[1:25:14] Deanna back there she's my granddaughter
[1:25:17] I'm sorry I'd shoot every one of you for
[1:25:20] but I love my wife different
[1:25:23] than I love my granddaughter but it's
[1:25:25] still feel your love
[1:25:26] then we know what it goes down to it
[1:25:28] goes down to all them other things do
[1:25:30] you ever think of that God the Great
[1:25:31] Master rainbow in the sky with seven
[1:25:33] spirits of God read perfect love after
[1:25:36] that comes filio love from agape love to
[1:25:38] feel your love that's the love that you
[1:25:40] have for your wife if some man would
[1:25:42] insult her you'd shoot his brains out
[1:25:44] see I wasn't very harsh brother Brown
[1:25:46] would shoot brains out see because it
[1:25:48] creates a jealousy
[1:25:51] but that filial that's filial love
[1:25:54] secondary love then comes lust for
[1:25:57] another man's wife then comes filth and
[1:25:59] we see that in the end time see it just
[1:26:01] becomes perverted but all of this kind
[1:26:03] of love had a beginning but when that
[1:26:06] real genuine love of God that I've been
[1:26:08] talking about comes into the human being
[1:26:10] by the new birth
[1:26:12] being born again it had no beginning and
[1:26:15] it will have no end yes
[1:26:17] you are then a Son of God a daughter of
[1:26:20] God in your affections or on things
[1:26:22] above feel your love would make you
[1:26:24] shoot a man for insulting your wife
[1:26:26] agape love would make you pray for his
[1:26:29] lost soul
[1:26:30] that's the difference
[1:26:32] like bro Dale somebody asked him one
[1:26:34] time a long time ago said would you
[1:26:35] shoot somebody if he's intruding in your
[1:26:37] house would you shoot somebody he said
[1:26:38] yes I would he said but I pray for him
[1:26:41] till the paramedics got there
[1:26:43] right
[1:26:46] shoot first pray later foreign
[1:26:49] I've never done that and everyone in his
[1:26:51] house without announcing who I was was
[1:26:53] going on to
[1:26:57] baptism of the Holy Ghost 1958 let me
[1:26:59] read this and then we'll close musicians
[1:27:00] get ready to come and then the first
[1:27:02] great spirit of God which is love God's
[1:27:04] like a great rainbow we couldn't imagine
[1:27:06] what he looks like look at the
[1:27:07] perversion in the world what they've
[1:27:09] turned the rainbow into
[1:27:11] those are seven colors of God those are
[1:27:13] the seven uh spirits of God those are
[1:27:15] the seven things that God give us as a
[1:27:17] covenant and the world is making it some
[1:27:19] garbage
[1:27:20] LGBT and all that other stuff they're
[1:27:22] doing they've used a rainbow
[1:27:25] well I think we ought to take it back
[1:27:28] then again the first great spirit of God
[1:27:29] is love God's like the rainbow we
[1:27:32] couldn't imagine what he looks like but
[1:27:34] just say he looked like the rainbow in
[1:27:35] spirit the perfect Spirit of love red
[1:27:37] blue the perfect Spirit of Fellowship
[1:27:39] just all perfect spirits and then you
[1:27:42] begin to condescend coming down and they
[1:27:44] come all the way down from filio love or
[1:27:46] agape love to feel your love and on down
[1:27:48] to lust and on down to the lowest and
[1:27:51] then God himself became a man Jesus and
[1:27:53] came down that same way to the lowest
[1:27:56] pits of Hell picked out those who he
[1:27:58] knew before the foundation of the world
[1:28:00] the Genesis 1 26 crowd the born-again
[1:28:03] crowd all right whose names were written
[1:28:05] on the book and redeemed them back to
[1:28:07] itself there you are the story of
[1:28:09] redemption cannot be fully known until
[1:28:12] we see him and stand in his likeness
[1:28:14] listen
[1:28:16] the full Plan of Redemption will not be
[1:28:18] understood until we get that Capstone
[1:28:20] when we get to The Headstone that's when
[1:28:23] it will happen
[1:28:25] and we'll go through this just a second
[1:28:26] we'll
[1:28:29] I don't need that
[1:28:34] let me read this down here real quick
[1:28:35] and then musicians come on everybody
[1:28:37] let's stand
[1:28:40] that's how much I had to miss
[1:28:43] don't look up it'll make you sick
[1:28:49] we're going to talk about that this
[1:28:50] afternoon we're going to get to this I
[1:28:52] said we get to it today but we're going
[1:28:53] to get to selfish
[1:28:55] because you can't have brotherly love
[1:28:56] and be selfish
[1:28:58] selfish means to be selfish is to be
[1:29:00] concerned excessively and exclusively
[1:29:03] with yourself
[1:29:05] selfishness is one of the biggest
[1:29:07] obstacles to having the kind of close
[1:29:09] relationship with God and inspiring
[1:29:11] relationships with other people that
[1:29:13] many of us desire
[1:29:15] let me read you what the prophet of God
[1:29:17] said about this
[1:29:21] 19th this is 1950.
[1:29:25] not 2023
[1:29:28] brother Brown said the people has got
[1:29:30] too selfish got to a place where they
[1:29:32] think they live in a little world by
[1:29:33] their self you know that's the truth
[1:29:36] all right listen to this
[1:29:40] this is where I wanted to get to but
[1:29:41] I'll read it this afternoon but now this
[1:29:43] is your prophet 1954. he says I
[1:29:46] recognize the other day a selfish Spirit
[1:29:48] coming upon me

[1:29:53] a prophet
[1:29:55] he got a selfish Spirit I'm just reading
[1:29:57] what he said
