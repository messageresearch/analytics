TRANSCRIPT
========================================
problems with uh we're gonna finish up right here with uh 19 seconds huh maybe it will in a second now it's moving all right Hebrews 11. sometimes when you turn it on it takes about 10 seconds for the relay now we're going to talk about we're going to finish with faith today next Sunday we're going to talk about virtue so what I want you to do is is go on your computers and if you don't have a computer look in the back of your Bible if you have a Scofield bible but look up the word Virtue get the definition of the word Virtue and I want all of you to look up the word Virtue look in Webster dictionary look in Bible dictionary and let's see what we can get as far as a definition of virtue all right um and then what we're going to do is we're going to pick examples of virtue in the Bible first because the Bible is our example that's our first example that's the only example we should look at we shouldn't look at um you know Dave Ramsey first or James Dobson first or Kenneth Copeland first I'm naming names because you know you just don't want to do that first you want to go to the Bible First now these people reflect the Bible exactly then that's fine but if they don't let's take the Bible first and then let's see what virtue is because remember many people can have virtue you know there's people you just you don't like to be around and there's people you do like to be around Christian or non-Christian right okay the ones you like to be around is not just because they agree with everything you say it shouldn't be that's right it should be that you receive virtue or strength from what they say or what they do right that's why I always said and people think you know you well you're putting brother down on a pedestal but I wanted to have I wanted to act like him being have the same God he had with the same gods and me is in him it'll make us act the same we're not going to be exactly the same human wise but we're also we're definitely going to be the same as far as our Christian experience and our um the way God deals with us all right so that's virtue that's what you virtue is strength somebody you like to be around it's not that they like to hunt and you like to hunt that is just an added bonus but we're going to get into the real look of virtue what virtue is brother Ram said virtue is strength and you've got to have it in order to get it Jesus had it therefore the woman at the well Drew from me the woman with the bloody shoe Drew from it uh the man at the gate beautiful Drew from Peter that's where virtue came that's one of the to me that's one of the most important scriptures as far as virtue Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None I can't buy you a doctor's visit I can't pay for your hospital stay but such as I have so he had a virtue he had to or he wouldn't have been able to pin it in second Peter right he had to have it before he could get it right so that's where we want to look and see that but today I want to read a few things you know we went by faith these people but watch verse eight of Hebrews 11 because that is the father of our faith which was Abraham all right Abraham looking looking in Abraham's Journey you say well my and he wouldn't be my choice well thank God you're not God because when Peter or Paul wrote about him the Bible the Bible says in in there in Romans that he was strong in faith why because Abraham just got up lived an everyday life but he always had a testimony that he was going to have that child that was his testimony that's the same way with you and I he said by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receiving for an inheritance I underlined that next word obey he obeyed what God Said that is our problem we do not obey what God said everything okay that's why the statue of perfect man helps you invert you to obey God knowledge helps you to obey God Temperance helps you to obey God and then you get all the way up there to love him we're going to talk about something a long time from now probably is that you're going to be God May manifest in another form all right that's what I was telling about in Kansas this past weekend there's a um and I don't know if y'all knew that but when I was I was out there in January it was just dry and they had been going through a grout trees were dying their homes were so dry until they was having to wash down their foundations to keep the ground from cracking so far away from their house I mean they were like in a parts Wasteland and I was driving to church and I saw all that and when I come to church there that Sunday and just real heavy on my heart and I told him I said I know you're having a drought I said let's pray so we pray and I just prayed a simple prayer that the Lord would give him one of the wettest brains that they've had in recent history and to get them out of the drought well make a long story short they had the wettest spring it started by two weeks after I left they had 17 inches of snow and before that got off the ground they had about 12 more inches of snow then they had another one more snow than it had since the 60s well now you know as well as I do snow does more for a drought than anything because it really gets down in the soil loosens up the soil so when it does rain it will you know help the crops and Help The Help the soil so then come springtime brother Jim pinston kept sending me text messages he said you can stop praying now he said wearing a deluge our rivers are overflowing our our I can't remember the lake it starts with the sea it was like 18 feet below full pool now it's that full pool so they've had enough rain to fill up 18 feet of water in this in this Reservoir so then he keeps sending it again I sent him a text back and I said look I said the Bible says I hear a sound of abundance of rain well about a week later he sent me another message he'd ring like four inches that week and he said we have now the abundance of rain so you can stop praying well when I got out there I told him I said I never prayed for one prayer I didn't keep praying I prayed one prayer and it just I just you know settled in my heart one of the sisters called Jim said I knew him brother Wade prayed that she was an old she was an old lady and or not an old lady but she's an older lady I'm not coach she doesn't see this bless her heart but his brother uh Chad's mother-in-law she said I'm you when he prayed that prayer that you that you had better take the saddle off your horse and put it under your wagon well that's an old saying for out there if it's starting to rain you don't want your saddle get wet so you can take it off and put it under the wagon so she said I knew we were in for you know all that so anyway they they're they're getting on me about it when I go out there you know and I said hey I said one prayer I said are you doing it but anyway make a long story short God and they said well we were praying also I said well it doesn't make me special it's just that it came on my heart it was just a burden like a heavy something was sitting on top of my shoulders you know for all the people in the and the plants and animals and and they were having trouble with their houses cracking and all that stuff and um we uh got to a place in the sermon and I said you know I said God wants us to be God God can send rain anytime he wants to right he's God he can do whatever he wants to but remember like Ronald's talking he predestinates by your desire he looks at your desire well the desire I had matched the desire they had right so God is not the one that called for rain hold on man God's not the one that just well I'm going to send the brain because they need it another had to be a connection God wanted us to be God ain't that what you know what Adam was Adam didn't have to ask God is it too cold is it too hot is it no brother Brown said Adam just said peace be still win pretty move over here and that's why because he wanted you to be gone and that's what God wants he wants us to be God is that too much he wants us to be gone because we are God made manifest in another form right that's right right when we get over there I believe when we get in that in that future home and we get living in that City the people outside that city is going to know one thing for sure God's living that City not just one Jesus but millions of little jesuses living in that City and they're going to know because see they don't have the understanding we do they need to receive a new birth they're not the family of God they have an impartation of eternal life which is true but they are not the children of God so they don't understand their daddy because he's not their dad but see he's our dad and we get to understand because we are Gods Bible equal says you're goddess this is what I say about Abraham watch what he's looking for it says obey and he went out not knowing whether he went now remember he was led by the Holy Ghost but he was not that he had no indwelling of the Holy Ghost to make him a born-again believer so he had to go by the things that he felt and saw and didn't see if he looked at circumstances guess what he would have failed but he did not look at circumstances we have got to stop looking at circumstances but he didn't know where he was going don't you watch reading on down here a little bit closer by faith he sojourned in the land of promise he was in the land that he was going to inherit he just didn't know it now that's the difference in me and you he received the promise as a natural promise of an actual son but in tight it was a promise of what Abraham you're going to inherit everywhere you go wherever the soul of your feet this is all going to be your inheritance um the Bible said he was looking for a city whose building makers God and he was walking on it the whole time he just did he didn't have a revelation because he didn't have the new birth he didn't have the Holy Ghost in his soul to lead him and guide him into all truth that's why when he would do what God says and then he would come over here and give his wife away or try to give her away twice and then he would take Hagar at the suggestion of his wife at the suggestion of his wife and have a child which was not a promised child God didn't tell him anything about that not one thing he'd tell him that he was going to give him anything with Hagar okay so he had a promise but he didn't know how to achieve it did I say that he he was walking in the land he didn't have a revelation because he didn't have that faith that you and I have which is the new birth because God promised once you give the new birth and he'd lead you and guide you into what all true all right so these people in the Old Testament they walked in faith believing that's why the Bible says and that's why brother brother Brown said he said every Prophet look to this day why because we have the new birth as an indwelling not just a not just anointing it comes on us and leaves us no wear what they were looking for that's why every Prophet spoke of this age every Prophet spoke of a bride every Prophet spoke of God being dwelling in a people not with the people all right so now watch this by faith he's so journey in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which had Foundation now watch our foundation Faith right whose building maker has got through faith now see not by faith but through faith Sarah also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed see that's when their bodies will change excuse man was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised she believed all right therefore sprained there even a one and him as good as dead how about Abraham so many as the stars of the sky multitude and as a sandwich is by the seashore innumerable here's Abraham 99 years old one day absolutely no way to fulfill that promise if you don't have kids you can't have a multiple children but out of one child Isaac the promised son out of that one child came as many as the stars of the sky and multitude and the sandwiches by the seashore innumerable listen to this in verse 13 what we're getting to these all died in faith not having received the promises now Scofield does a pretty good job here if you if you look in your footnote it says Genesis 3 15. I'll put MIT between in other words the speaking of the coming of Jesus Christ and him dying what to release the Holy Ghost but having seen them afar off hmm he saw them by faith you can see something but if it's not for you listen to this if it's not for you you'll miss it Abraham for an example he was looking for a city the city was right there he just it just wasn't revealed to him that he was walking on it but as the people came down through time and when Jesus came on Earth he said having a miracle passed away but my word will never pass away so in other words all the cities and all the things and they walked took to Jesus one day and said he said well what's going to happen he said well this Temple will be destroyed won't be one stone left upon another one this is some great Taj Mahal looking thing you know big huge Temple and they said won't be one stone and I said no but see he wasn't talking about a heavenly in other words he was saying all these kingdoms are going to be done away with and same with this all these kingdoms are going to be done away with these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them look at that persuaded of them I believe Abraham once he did get a revelation for his time because it had to be revealed to him one day that that baby is now not coming it's now all right especially when you wake up one morning and your wife was 98 the day before and she's 20 the next day Hallelujah what a what up for all times wow but you know what it still took both of them to produce that child didn't change Abraham and not Sarah the bride's got to be changed Christ took a body change and Calvary I mean at the resurrection right so he's waiting on his wife he's waiting on his wife to take a body change so that we'll have a body like into his glorious body his body's 20 years old his body's not old his body's not 30 or 50 or what it was on the earth that's why Mary Magdalene a great Revelation she thought he was a gardener what some young kid but when he spoke you knew that voice and she said my Lord so she knew who he was then but when she turned and looked at him she'd never seen him at 20 years old so he was a little young guy and she's like well who's this young kid right here but see she had a revelation I believe when he spoke she said something happened see she responded to the word the word which is the word she responded to the word and she saw that he's been changed so that's what we're right now we're God's waiting on now for his bride to be changed so we can get out of here all right so these all died in faith now not with faith they shouldn't have but they died in faith into faith for their time they died not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded because remember who was that that said somebody said Abraham looked for a city whose building maker was God but he longed for that City but he never saw it physically but you and I are walking in it right now all right and embrace them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the Earth listen to this for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek the country and truly hmm look at this and truly if they had been mindful of that country what not not not the land of Canaan or the land that country that promise from which they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned Jesus said I come from God I go back to God you and I can say the same thing through faith through revelation we come from God and we're going right back to God all right so that's our City all right we're gonna live in a physical City but we have now possessed the enemy right now it's because we're living in a human body that the enemy that the enemy has a hold on this day but the city's down inside and there's no way the Satan can take it from you if you're born again whose building maker is God okay talking about the new birth they might have opportunity to have returned but now they desire a better country that is and heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he has prepared for them a city Jesus said in John 14 he said I go away and what I prepare a place a city we know that's the future of home but we also know that he went to prepare a place to come back into me and you that's what he was preparing he was preparing those disciples he compared the 120 in the upper room and then when he did he brought the city right down on top of it John saw the city coming from Heaven to Earth throw a piece of that city that you were you already have now if you're born again because it came from above Jesus said you have to be born from above not down here from above all right so the city is already descended on you if you're born again all right or have faith that's that Faith right there is not just believing that tomorrow that the sun's going to come up that Faith there is believing that you are an absolute baptized with the holy ghost son and daughter of God Born Into The Kingdom can't get out of it found it already and accepted and just walk into it now that substance Faith you may fail every day you may fail every 15 minutes but there's something inside of you that holds men uh uh Dad we're talking about something the other day Friday going down to the Hunt Club and and it's true you see all these people now they don't have substance Faith so they're falling out they have faith in the message I mean this is what I understand and see that and it happens here I'm sorry but you see people come in they're they're not here and then they just come in and they sit down and they sit down under Heavenly atmosphere all right just sit down under Heavenly atmosphere and by knowledge by human knowledge if somebody brings the word to you by human knowledge you ought to be able to see certain scene not by the new birth by human knowledge I knew what happened you want to know why because it happened to me when I was 14 years old coming to this church I could explain serpent season if you'll ask brother Tatum he said I could explain one God like most preachers but I did not have any birth no what did I do I came under the umbrella of the message maybe a confession but no possession so I didn't run the race all the way out I run to a certain spot and stop and went out in the world why there was no possession there there was no City there I went out in the world because I was born in sand shape and iniquity you'd come sit in this church and from what brother they'll preaches and it's simple as he breaks it down you cannot have a new birth one day and understand what he's talking about today I see some doing this but that's exactly the truth we've got to have a new birth Holy Ghost experience it don't have to be shouting it don't have to be running around and screaming you understand but it's got to be an experience because what's going to happen is it's one day you don't start falling you can't finish the race Paul finished his race he testified he said I've run my race I fought the good fight but what happens now even with preachers you see preachers in a message now just not even just not even just going into false Doctrine we're not even talking about those they hang around just to mess things up that's the make believer in the mixed multitude but you see him just doing this going from the message sitting in a Baptist Church now how are you going to do that what happened is they had they had a anointing of this message Joel said I'll pour out my spirit on just a message Believers oh no that's not what he said he said I'll pour out my spirit on All Flesh now that's not the new birth it is if you take it on in that's right but if you just let it anoint your spirit you can sit in a message church and die and go to hell just as quick as Adolf Hitler amen if you don't let it become a total part of your life you say well I fail every day well so do we but what do you do you still come to church you still read your Bible you still have a desire to want to know more about God that's why I do you know everybody thinks claude's rough and Daddy's rough I wish to God if we could preach all these 80 or 90 people to go to church here I wish I could preach them all into hell so we can get you out but if you believe you're already in heaven but your Soul's in hell you're deceived and this message is the greatest deception without the holy ghost that ever has come on the face of the Earth everybody understand what I just said yes this message is pure and holy but what land has done to it is they've made it some great because listen let me prove that Paul says you can know all Mysteries one God water baptism no eternal hell said you can know all Mysteries and have not charity you know what is that you can know all Mysteries but not have the Holy Ghost because that anointing is so strong in this day and hour yes the prophet brought the message he brought the open book and uh people just come in and sit down and just well I'm in the message I must have the Holy Ghost no that don't mean a thing the devil got here before you did and he ain't born again but he's in the message what do you think you think he's out there he's already got them they're already his they're his children would you believe it or not brother Brown said you take a father son Holy Ghost baptism he said that come from the pits of hell and once the words been made known you can't go back to that I don't see how in the world you could leave this message and go back to uh you know if you leave this message just going out the world of sin don't go to a Baptist Church that's right that's worse really at least we go out in the world of sin you know you lost and God might have some Grace to get you back but if you go sit at the Baptist Church say well I'm okay I'm going to church everything's fine then you're deceived and like brothers always said if you're deceived you don't know it you have to have somebody bring it to light that's why I said I wish we could preach everybody lost and then everybody would go I'm lost now let's start into justification now let's start in the sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost so just listen to what brother they was talking about because you know what we're going to prove our predestination somewhere down the line somewhere down the line you're going to fall off no more down the line you're going to say wow I really don't have to go to church my family is more important my my desk and my that come on people we let a lot of things get in the way but this should be our focal point yeah of what we're doing in life is to be strong as a Christian be showing virtue showing knowledge showing Temple showing faith not just have it because if you haven't you'll show it Peter Peter's just I mean Peter didn't walk by and go bless God I've got what that man needs but you didn't do that he walked by just like I did out there driving the church he had compassion on what was going on he looked at that man they might have been a hundred blind death mute laying at that gate called beautiful but one man's made a connection to what Peter had and he said sir have mercy on me and that was the connection there was a connection there and Peter said so we're going to have my name such as I have rise up on your feet and lock and he did that proved he had virtue all right so we're going to prove whether we have the new birth or not it's somewhere along the line something's going to happen in your life and you're going to either make a right hand turn are you going to go straight ahead and not worry about the right hand turn right verse 17 we're still not going to get through this by faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac and he that had received the promise offered up his only begotten son of whom it was said that in Isaac shall I see be called in other words he was fixing to kill the very promise that God gave him give you Isaac to have all these children and now I want you to kill him let's let's skip over verse 38. read real quick you can read all these other things look at verse 25 Moses choosing made a choice it's your choice people God predestinates by your choice and nothing else what you choose of whom the world was not worthy in other words all these people they wandered in deserts in mountains and dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report this is what this is a good report in Hebrews 11. through faith receive not the promise not promises promise what's the promise New Birth I'll come back and restore this thing all right God having provided some better thing for us what the new birth that they that didn't have it without us should not be made perfect haul it back and saw all them and said hey man they didn't have the new birth but look how great they were look they weren't the world wasn't even worthy for them to be walking on it but they didn't receive a promise you have the promise now so we'll start on virtue because that is the promise of God then he'll give us virtue if we will ask for it all right let's go I got a battery oh yeah foreign everybody because I was that I was you know slipping right and that's why I want to do it backwards right I'm not going to let there oh you know perfect thank you
