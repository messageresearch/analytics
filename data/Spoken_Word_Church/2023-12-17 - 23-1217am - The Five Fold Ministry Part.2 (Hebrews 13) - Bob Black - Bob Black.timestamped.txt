[0:00] BL you I sure appreciate the ones that
[0:02] are in the back today it might just be I
[0:05] just I just poked my head in there a
[0:06] minute ago and it was just Abby so I
[0:08] don't know if that's still the same but
[0:11] we sure appreciate
[0:12] you holding down the
[0:15] four and uh so let's just bow our heads
[0:19] in prayer Lord we're so grateful to be
[0:20] able to gather around your word today
[0:22] Lord and we know that your will is found
[0:24] in your word your word is your will and
[0:26] Lord we just ask your will for us today
[0:29] Lord God I know that every everyone
[0:30] sitting here today that gathered
[0:32] together Lord our desire is to be
[0:34] walking in the perfect will of God we
[0:36] just ask Lord that your blessing upon
[0:38] the people today Lord give us what we
[0:40] have need of we pray in your
[0:42] name so we've been kind of meditating on
[0:45] uh remember them which have the rule
[0:47] over you who have spoken unto you the
[0:49] word of God whose Faith follow
[0:51] considering the end of their
[0:52] conversation and kind of went through
[0:55] some quotes where brother randam was
[0:57] explaining how it's not the rule of man
[0:59] but it's is the rule it's the actual the
[1:01] word that's that uh is is being
[1:04] preached that is is what's ruling us and
[1:08] I I just wanted to kind of really
[1:11] meditate on the what's being preached as
[1:14] as truth and kind of compare that with a
[1:16] little scripture there in second Timothy
[1:19] where Paul is explaining to Timothy he's
[1:22] um 2 Timothy 3 is is a uh first and
[1:26] second Timothy both have some some
[1:28] really good advice for preachers and uh
[1:30] in 2 Timothy 3 he's telling Timothy this
[1:33] know also that in the last days perilous
[1:35] time shall come for men shall be lovers
[1:37] of their own selves Covetous boasters
[1:40] proud blasphemer disobedient to parents
[1:43] unth thankful Unholy without natural
[1:45] affection truce Breakers false accusers
[1:47] incontinence Fierce despisers of those
[1:49] that are good traitors heady high-m
[1:51] minded lovers of Pleasures more than
[1:52] lovers of God having a form of godliness
[1:55] but denying the power thereof from such
[1:58] turn away now then he says this this
[2:00] quote this scripture this very
[2:01] interesting to me he says for of this
[2:04] sort are they which creep into houses
[2:06] and Lead captive silly women Laden with
[2:08] the sins LED away with diverse lust now
[2:10] look look listen to this ever learning
[2:14] now we got a picture of of of a man
[2:16] sitting there amongst a bunch bunch of
[2:18] books he just got a stack of books and
[2:20] he's just learning and learning and
[2:21] learning reading and reading and reading
[2:23] now think about what a jposition that is
[2:25] that you could be ever learning and
[2:27] never able to come to the knowled
[2:29] knowled of the truth now maybe uh
[2:33] Wednesday night I kind of touched on
[2:34] this a little bit maybe poorly explained
[2:36] what my point was but my point is that
[2:38] there's a lot of things that you can
[2:39] learn there's a there's a lot of things
[2:41] you can go back in the Old Testament
[2:42] learn about all the different parts of a
[2:44] Candlestick and learn about all sorts of
[2:46] thing and uh that was maybe my testimony
[2:49] too when I when I first become a
[2:50] Christian you go into the bookstore and
[2:51] you get all these books and you you
[2:53] check them out and you you know you'd
[2:55] read and you read and you read and but
[2:57] one day you get into the message you you
[2:59] get under the message of your day and
[3:02] that's when truth really begins to open
[3:05] up and you get in this this channel
[3:07] something begins to open up and where
[3:09] you actually see Christ you see the
[3:12] Revelation for your day am now see what
[3:15] a what a strange thing that is that
[3:16] there's there's people all around the
[3:18] Christian world that are learning and
[3:20] learning and learning and heaping up to
[3:22] themselves all this information but
[3:25] that's not what Christianity is about
[3:27] just learning things just heaping up
[3:29] knowledge and facts facts facts upon
[3:31] facts but what we come we come to church
[3:35] to have an experience with Christ
[3:37] because Christ is truth and despite all
[3:40] the things that we can maybe learn and
[3:41] learn it the the objective is to know
[3:44] truth now that truth is what's got to be
[3:46] conveyed from behind the pulpit truth is
[3:49] is what will have a rule over you if
[3:51] truth will grab a hold of your life and
[3:54] and I there's this there's this uh
[3:56] saying that has been repeated down from
[3:59] the theologians and ministers down
[4:01] Through the Ages that truth truth
[4:03] without love you got to mix it with love
[4:05] truth without love can be brutal man
[4:08] love without truth it can be hypocrisy
[4:12] love without truth you you just end up
[4:14] loving everything truth without love can
[4:16] be real hard so you got to mix those
[4:18] things together then you got something
[4:21] that you can hang on so think about this
[4:24] ever learning and never able to come to
[4:26] the knowledge of the truth and and God
[4:27] keeps his word brother Ram said from
[4:29] such turn away for this is the sort that
[4:32] goes from house to house with their
[4:34] little books and campaigns and so forth
[4:37] and leads silly women Laden with sin LED
[4:40] away with divers lust ever learning and
[4:42] never able to come to the truth what
[4:44] kind are they Janice and jambers have
[4:47] all kinds of Fantastics and everything
[4:49] as Janice and jambus withstood Moses so
[4:51] will these resist the truth men of
[4:53] reprobate mind concerning the word
[4:56] trying to take the word of God and
[4:58] pervert it into something else
[5:00] into a fantastic or religious
[5:02] organization or build them up a great
[5:04] name or make themselves some great name
[5:07] from such turn away stay with the word
[5:11] and you'll find if you really if you
[5:12] really pay attention to the things that
[5:14] brother random is bringing out there's
[5:16] down Through the Ages there was you know
[5:17] those that you you could hear John
[5:19] Wesley's message and and and as in the
[5:22] season and the time that it was
[5:24] delivered that was how you'd come to
[5:26] Christ but now in this day you got to
[5:29] come to the message there was a time
[5:31] when the when the seals were opened up
[5:33] and the Word was made plain that's it it
[5:37] all that denominational time ended and
[5:39] it now you come if you want to hear it
[5:41] you got to come to where the word is
[5:44] right you won't uh a real Born Again
[5:46] experience you got to come to the where
[5:47] the word is and the word can only be
[5:50] found in the season in the age that is
[5:52] delivered under a prophet's message now
[5:55] there's the essence of the of the thing
[5:57] and the message pardon he said I having
[5:59] a form of godliness they go to church
[6:01] they join Church they try to make a long
[6:03] showing that they are going to church
[6:05] and things and go out and live different
[6:07] there's no file fire in their soul
[6:10] there's nothing they're not interested
[6:12] in anybody else talking about somebody
[6:14] that's just ever learning but not coming
[6:16] to the knowledge of the truth everybody
[6:18] else can die and go if they want to now
[6:20] think about what he's saying he's saying
[6:21] real Christianity is not just to know a
[6:24] lot of things but to actually be
[6:26] concerned about your brother and sister
[6:28] actually be concerned about seeing Souls
[6:30] saved actually be concerned about
[6:32] whether somebody's well somebody's right
[6:34] somebody's going to go to hell or not we
[6:37] feel that we're saved let the rest of
[6:39] them go that isn't real Christianity so
[6:42] what's real Christianity truth the
[6:44] knowledge of the truth now Martin Luther
[6:47] said Peace if possible but Truth at any
[6:49] rate Dwight Moody said God never made a
[6:52] promise that was too good to be true
[6:54] when God said it ain't too good to be
[6:56] true it's true and Thomas Fuller said if
[6:58] I speak what is is false I must answer
[7:00] for it if
[7:01] truth think what a awesome quote if I
[7:05] speak what is false I got to answer for
[7:07] it but if truth it will answer for
[7:12] me truth is what it's all about
[7:15] truth now come on y'all I W been
[7:18] speaking 10 minutes y'all y'all can open
[7:20] up your
[7:21] eyes goodness
[7:26] gracious come on y'all we we need to
[7:28] stand up for a
[7:31] minute y'all can do it now we're not
[7:33] even into the service yet it's only 10
[7:36] minutes I hadn't even speaking 10
[7:37] minutes trying to do and trying to do
[7:40] God a service that uh without being as
[7:42] the will of God what I was preaching on
[7:44] Wednesday night brother Ram said this
[7:46] was Moses speaking to Israel after he
[7:48] had been Vindicated by God by a pillar
[7:50] of fire and knowed he was proven to be
[7:52] God's servant to lead them out and
[7:54] before they went into the land before
[7:56] they entered Moses said now the words
[7:58] that I have spoken to you I call Heaven
[8:00] and Earth to witness against you if you
[8:02] add one thing to it or take one word
[8:04] from it you'll not stay in the land
[8:07] where the Lord God gives you now now
[8:10] this is where brother brand is
[8:11] explaining that scripture that I asked
[8:13] everybody to read on Wednesday night
[8:15] Deuteronomy 4 and uh somebody asked me
[8:18] about this he preached this sermon twice
[8:21] the last time he preached it he just
[8:22] told the congregation to read that when
[8:24] they go home but in Jeffersonville when
[8:26] he preached it in this sermon he he he
[8:29] reads it in front of everybody and then
[8:31] he explains it what he's saying is you
[8:34] better stay with my word cuz you ain't
[8:36] going to stay in this land I'm talking
[8:39] about that Capstone you ain't going to
[8:41] get get in this land if you don't stay
[8:43] with what I'm saying you won't the you
[8:45] want the promises of God you must stay
[8:47] within the season and the time and the
[8:49] the one that God has chosen you better
[8:51] line up right with his word or you ain't
[8:53] going to the promised land amen he said
[8:55] so say I in the name of Jesus Christ
[8:58] don't you add one thing
[8:59] don't take put your own ideas in it you
[9:02] just say what is said on those tapes you
[9:04] just do exactly what the Lord God has
[9:06] commanded to do don't add to it now I'm
[9:09] still talking about preaching I'm still
[9:11] talking
[9:12] about that what's ruling over us is the
[9:15] word of God so you got to we can't add
[9:18] our own ideas our own thoughts and and
[9:21] and just to kind of nail that home I
[9:23] there's a there's a really interesting
[9:24] story that I I just happened to be
[9:27] reading the other day speaking of Truth
[9:30] speaking of conveying truth about
[9:33] brother Neville and it's then that
[9:35] sermon trying to do God a service
[9:37] without being the will without being his
[9:38] will he said many times a man God can
[9:41] deal with them give them a gift and the
[9:44] people will squeeze in on those people
[9:46] so he's tell he's going to start talking
[9:47] about brother Neville who had a gift in
[9:49] his life if they're not perfectly called
[9:51] and sin of God he'll cause that man or
[9:53] woman to say something that isn't his
[9:55] will why because the people constrains
[9:57] them to do it now that's where you can
[10:00] see something gets moving in the people
[10:02] and they start pull pulling the or
[10:04] pressuring the preacher to do say
[10:06] something that he shouldn't be saying
[10:08] like and this is what they did to
[10:09] brother Neville see the TRU truth is
[10:11] what I'm talking about this morning how
[10:13] he said how I had to catch our own
[10:15] little pasture here on it out here in
[10:18] the woods one morning about 3:00 in the
[10:20] morning said go tell brother Neville I
[10:23] come to you didn't I brother Neville he
[10:26] said everybody brother Neville prophesy
[10:28] over me this is what the people were
[10:30] constraining him in other words they
[10:32] were trying to get him off of just just
[10:33] instead of just saying the truth what
[10:35] God if God revealed something to him
[10:37] he'd say that but they' be to push and
[10:39] say just just tell just tell me this or
[10:42] that he don't quite explain that that's
[10:45] what brother Dev Neville did but I think
[10:46] we can kind of read between the lines
[10:48] brother Neville got in trouble with the
[10:50] prophet now that's where we need a
[10:52] prophet comes in handy because a prophet
[10:54] is going to be about truth a prophet
[10:56] could tell you well when you told this
[10:59] story or this dream you left out this
[11:01] part of it and a prophet that's where
[11:04] you know some sometimes you'll say what
[11:06] boy wouldn't it be nice if we had a
[11:07] prophet to tell us all the different
[11:09] things in the church you know what I
[11:10] think would be good to have a prophet to
[11:12] tell me my problems that's what I would
[11:15] want to Prophet I'd want to sit down
[11:16] with a prophet and say if there like
[11:18] David did F if there's is there anything
[11:20] wrong with my motives and objectives
[11:22] because a prophet is about truth a
[11:24] prophet I I I I knew this uh this
[11:27] brother when we were in South Carolina
[11:29] that had had seven interviews with
[11:31] brother brandham and he said that this
[11:33] is what a prophet can do he he go in
[11:35] there and a prophet would tell him let
[11:37] your wife handle the finances this is
[11:39] why you got this kind of problem and oh
[11:41] lay out all those kind of things in his
[11:43] life and just lay everything bear but
[11:46] look what uh I'm getting off my my topic
[11:48] look look what the problem is with
[11:50] brother Neville he said everybody
[11:52] brother Neville prophec over me tell
[11:54] tell me this or that see you would have
[11:56] him saying things then that wouldn't
[11:59] come to pass it's all about truth right
[12:02] truth now see you you start looking at
[12:05] uh that uh nickan spirit moving up into
[12:17] bmismart is run or whatever and that
[12:19] could be that could be that something
[12:21] that ain't ain't right and that's why a
[12:24] minister behind the pulpit their
[12:25] objective what they're selling they
[12:27] merchandise is truth truth mixed with
[12:31] love right and brother Ram said in the
[12:33] Ephesian Church age I believe in
[12:35] leadership but it is not the leadership
[12:37] of men I believe in I believe in the
[12:38] leadership of the Holy Ghost coming
[12:40] through the word I believe also that God
[12:42] has set men in the church men who are
[12:44] gifted by the spirit and they will keep
[12:46] the church in order I believe that I
[12:48] believe also that the church is ruled
[12:50] over by men that God sins to take charge
[12:54] but that rule is by the word so that it
[12:56] is not men really ruling but the spirit
[12:59] of God for the word and spirit are one
[13:03] and there they are in Ephesians 4:11
[13:05] some Apostles some prophets some
[13:07] evangelists and some pastors and
[13:09] teachers and you could lump these all
[13:12] under the category of Shepherds and what
[13:15] a Shepherd is is they're really the
[13:17] lowest thing on the ladder a Shepherd is
[13:20] uh and we were talking last time this is
[13:22] this will be a good Christmas message a
[13:24] good little holiday message because why
[13:26] it had to be Shepherds Shepherds were
[13:27] the first ones to to be to be pointed to
[13:31] where Jesus was laying in the manger cuz
[13:33] why you going to have to come to a
[13:35] Shepherd you're going to have to hear it
[13:36] from a Shepherd to know where the word
[13:37] is and shepherds are really lowly people
[13:40] it's a just in the natural a a natural
[13:44] Shepherd is a semiskilled profession at
[13:46] best they didn't have nobody training
[13:48] some any training training given to them
[13:50] they just somebody just told them go
[13:51] watch the Sheep now in in the uh in the
[13:56] spiritual they better be a little bit
[13:58] skilled
[14:00] you you can't just come up and well I I
[14:02] don't know nothing about nothing you
[14:04] need to be a little bit skilled you need
[14:05] to be able to have well we'll look at
[14:07] that in a second and and you can they're
[14:10] so lowly that you can actually in some
[14:12] places like New Zealand or where they
[14:13] you can replace a shepherd with just a
[14:14] little dog have a dog running around
[14:16] watching the sheep and that's how low a
[14:19] Shepherd is and that's why Luke in Luke
[14:21] chapter 22 Jesus said let him who is
[14:23] greatest among you become as the
[14:25] youngest and the leader as the serpent
[14:29] servant leader as the servant in second
[14:32] Timothy 2 second see Paul there's a lot
[14:35] of good stuff for preachers and what
[14:37] Paul told Timothy in second Timothy 2
[14:40] Paul uses and you can go read that I'm
[14:41] not going to Bel this point but he uses
[14:43] seven different ways to describe a
[14:46] minister with describing sacrifice and
[14:49] labor and service and hardship now he
[14:50] calls a minister a teacher he calls him
[14:53] a soldier an athlete a farmer a Workman
[14:58] a vessel and a
[15:01] slave and all of those things are
[15:05] metaphors for somebody that's working
[15:07] hard that's sacrificing themselves for
[15:11] somebody else that's in service that's
[15:14] in a in a duty that is not easy and
[15:17] that's why nobody that is dominated by
[15:19] their own self is fit for this task
[15:23] that's why Matthew 2025 Jesus said Jesus
[15:25] called unto them and said ye know that
[15:27] the princes of the Gentiles exercise
[15:29] dominion over them and that are they
[15:31] that are great Authority upon them and
[15:34] they that are great exercise Authority
[15:36] upon them why CU that's how the
[15:40] Gentiles ruling with a an idea that they
[15:44] they should be uh lifted up above
[15:46] everybody else in 2 Timothy 2 Paul's
[15:49] description does not make Ministry
[15:51] glamorous so that means leadership in
[15:52] the church is not a Manel of status to
[15:55] be confirmed on the church's aristocracy
[15:58] in other words who whoever's the big
[16:00] shot gets to be a minister it's not
[16:02] given by seniority in other words
[16:04] whoever's oldest gets to be a minister
[16:06] it's not purchased with money whoever's
[16:08] got the most money gets to be a minister
[16:10] it's not inherited through Family Ties
[16:13] that that would be great if I could just
[16:14] make my son a minister or something like
[16:16] that that that would be wonderful but
[16:18] that's not how you're called to be a
[16:19] minister it's not awarded to people who
[16:21] are successful in business or Finance
[16:23] who's got the most contribution to the
[16:25] church who have pays the most ties gets
[16:27] to be a minister that's not how it works
[16:30] and it's not dled out on the basis of
[16:31] intelligence or education or human
[16:33] Talent cuz if that were true then none
[16:35] of the Apostles would have been called
[16:37] there men who couldn't even read or
[16:38] write their own name or or all those
[16:40] things but God called them regardless
[16:43] the requirement to be a minister is
[16:46] faultless character and that's what Paul
[16:48] lays out in 1 Timothy 3 or or two two or
[16:52] three one of them spiritual maturity a
[16:55] willingness to serve humbly and a skill
[16:58] in teaching in other words if you can't
[17:00] convey a thought if you can't convey a
[17:02] thought in a way that people can
[17:04] understand it then and and we'll get to
[17:06] that in a moment how do you know if
[17:08] you're called to preach brother Bram
[17:10] said if you can do it that's a pretty
[17:12] good evidence that you're called if you
[17:14] can do it so what do Shepherds do they
[17:17] feed lead nurture care Comfort protect
[17:22] and
[17:23] correct now now you think about the role
[17:25] of a Shepherd a sheep without a shepher
[17:29] they they're just not going to be able
[17:30] to offend for themselves where are they
[17:32] going to find where to eat how are you
[17:33] going to find where to eat how are you
[17:35] going to find here comes a wolf the
[17:37] Sheep without a Shepherd what are they
[17:39] going to do a wolf comes in so now
[17:43] there's the principle that churches can
[17:46] survive almost every kind of
[17:49] problem except the failure of the
[17:53] Shepherds that's why you should pray for
[17:55] your ministers righten cuz you can find
[17:58] you can survive just about any kind of
[17:59] problem except the failure of the
[18:02] Shepherds if the Shepherds aren't doing
[18:04] their job then you're not going to be
[18:06] able to eat well if the Shepherds aren't
[18:08] doing their job then you're not going to
[18:09] be protected you're not going to be
[18:11] corrected you're not going to be able to
[18:13] move on because you need the Sheep the
[18:16] Shepherds and so we've been talking
[18:18] about all the different kinds of
[18:20] shepherds and he gave some Apostles you
[18:22] know different phases of your life
[18:24] different seasons of your life a
[18:25] different kind of ministry will will
[18:27] Minister more maybe more effective to
[18:29] you in that particular moment of your
[18:30] life or maybe you're down in the valley
[18:33] and you need some encouragement you know
[18:34] you need you need to be encouraged so
[18:36] here comes an evangelist he'll he'll
[18:38] preach a sermon that just picks you up
[18:39] and preaches a sermon about how God
[18:41] cares about you and boy that's the thing
[18:43] you needed right in that moment of your
[18:44] life or maybe maybe you're in a foreign
[18:47] country and you never heard about the
[18:48] message before and here comes an apostle
[18:50] that can make the just break something
[18:52] complicated down into just like a plant
[18:54] growing in the field and and preach
[18:56] something like that where it it just
[18:58] catch catches your attention and sets
[19:00] things in order or maybe there's a great
[19:02] big problem in your life that that just
[19:04] really needs uh some discernment and a
[19:07] prophet can minister in that need and
[19:10] some pastors and teachers so we're on
[19:13] pastors and pastors brother R said you
[19:15] see in the church there is the pastor
[19:17] and that Pastor is a special person
[19:19] built to where he can put up with the
[19:21] fusses of the people he's a burden
[19:24] Bearer he's the ox of the team he's a
[19:26] man that can sit down when the
[19:28] somebody's got something against
[19:29] somebody else and sit down with them two
[19:31] families and take neither side and
[19:33] reason it out and bring it right back
[19:35] into sweetness see he's a pastor he
[19:38] knows how to take care of
[19:41] things now we we were last time we were
[19:44] talking to isn't it interesting how each
[19:45] of these can uh uh an evangelist if if
[19:49] there was nobody else and we've seen
[19:51] that in a lot of churches they could
[19:52] slip over into the role of a pastor and
[19:54] do the job a teacher maybe could just
[19:56] slip over they're not really a teach a
[19:59] pastor but they could do that job and
[20:00] the same a pastor can teach a pastor if
[20:03] if there's nobody a pastor has that
[20:05] ability to teach but each of these has a
[20:09] that quality that is their default their
[20:11] makeup that God has moved them in where
[20:13] a pastor can put up with the fusses of
[20:15] the people and draw people together
[20:17] where he may not be able to lay out the
[20:19] word in the same way that a teacher can
[20:21] and a teacher wouldn't be able to
[20:23] necessarily deal with the people the
[20:24] same way that a pastor can so they've
[20:26] got these qualities that are in heing in
[20:29] them a pastor comes from the letin for
[20:32] Shepherd pastors guide care for and
[20:34] protect the congregation similar to how
[20:36] a Shepherd tends to sheep Pastor pastors
[20:38] teach pastors can teach pastors counsel
[20:42] they visit the sick and they are the
[20:44] head of the church and that's why
[20:45] brother B said always honor your pastor
[20:48] he's worthy of every bit of Honor you
[20:50] could give him the Bible said that yes
[20:54] sir and don't muzzle the ox that Treads
[20:57] out the corn
[20:59] that's that's don't muzzle the ox means
[21:01] that there's an ox plowing in the field
[21:02] and you don't muzzle put a muzzle over
[21:04] him so he can't reap the benefits of his
[21:06] labor you you there there's even last
[21:10] week I I mentioned last Sunday about how
[21:12] there's this controversy about paying
[21:14] ministers that ministers are just not
[21:16] supposed to get any reward for it and
[21:18] even last week I saw another argument on
[21:20] my Facebook where it broke out and
[21:22] everybody's arguing about how you're
[21:23] just you're not supposed to give any
[21:25] kind of reward to ministers which is
[21:28] contrary to the scripture and I could
[21:30] lay that out there's three or four
[21:31] scriptures where Paul says the Min
[21:34] ministers are worthy of their reward
[21:36] with all that labor and all that
[21:38] sacrifice and all that those
[21:41] things don't muzzle the ox that Treads
[21:43] out the corn right amen what a strange
[21:46] idea that what it is is is hate for
[21:49] ministers that like like that story our
[21:51] brother B getting arrest getting not
[21:53] arrested got pulled over by because the
[21:55] cop he didn't realize how fast he was
[21:57] going and that that cop that pulled him
[21:59] over just as soon as he saw on his on
[22:01] his driver's license that he was a
[22:02] minister you could tell just the hate
[22:03] wed up isn't that it's just strange how
[22:06] people are just n it's the devil it's
[22:08] the devil and people reacting they don't
[22:10] want to hear the truth they don't want
[22:12] somebody that stands for the truth in
[22:14] the message of Moses he said tonight so
[22:16] many people can believe God and this is
[22:19] about having confidence in the ministry
[22:21] he said sure you believe Christ you
[22:23] believe the Holy Ghost and so forth but
[22:25] when a man comes to you and tells
[22:26] something that's hard to believe I don't
[22:28] know whether I can believe you or not
[22:29] friend that's where it's at see there
[22:31] that's the reason God can't that's the
[22:33] reason your pastor sometimes when your
[22:35] pastor comes to you the reason he can't
[22:37] help you you've got to have faith in
[22:39] your pastor you got to believe that he's
[22:42] a man of God sin of God to do these
[22:45] things for him now that works both ways
[22:48] we've got to live a minister has got to
[22:50] live with a faulty character live with a
[22:53] uh preaching the truth not swayed by the
[22:56] congregation and then when when a man is
[22:58] doing that you've got to have confidence
[23:00] in him that he's bringing you the truth
[23:02] confidence to know that he's yielded
[23:04] himself and he's prayed up and studied
[23:06] up and he's not just speaking of himself
[23:08] but he's speaking something to help you
[23:10] then if you have confidence in a man
[23:11] like that you can have confidence in
[23:14] what God is saying then something you
[23:16] watch and something will happen am in
[23:19] Revelation book of symbols brother R
[23:21] said if a boy was at the door and
[23:24] knocked at the door latch tell the
[23:26] ushers I have a telegram here here for
[23:28] Mrs so and so and Mrs Mr so and so he
[23:30] would be a messenger Earthly Angel your
[23:33] pastor when he stands here on the
[23:35] platform ministering the word of God he
[23:37] is God's angel to the church Messenger
[23:40] to the church therefore a pastor should
[23:43] never leave that word but stay straight
[23:45] with the word because he's feeding the
[23:47] shepherd's place because the word pastor
[23:49] means Shepherd look it up and find out
[23:52] if that ain't right a pastor is a
[23:54] shepherd and the Holy Ghost has made him
[23:57] overseer over a certain flock to feed
[23:59] them what with the word of God now this
[24:03] all ties back to what Paul St saying
[24:06] remember them that have the rule over
[24:08] you they're not ruling over you with
[24:10] with uh an anvil beating you over the
[24:12] head but they're ruling Over You by
[24:13] giving you the word of God feeding you
[24:15] like a shepherd with sheep to tell you
[24:17] go over here there's a little nice
[24:19] little patch of grass watch out for that
[24:21] wolf over there watch out for that false
[24:23] Doctrine and they're leading you with
[24:24] the word where the word has such control
[24:26] over you when you begin to wool and you
[24:28] ain't even trying you're not struggling
[24:30] all you're doing is just eating you're
[24:31] just coming to church and the word grabs
[24:34] a hold of your life and begins to change
[24:35] you now there's a real Shepherd yes sir
[24:40] Jeremiah 3 says I will give you pasture
[24:42] Shepherds Shepherds is the translation
[24:44] of that word according to mine heart
[24:46] which shall feed you with knowledge and
[24:49] understanding they're feeding you with
[24:50] something that will give you give you uh
[24:52] a way to fight back against the devil
[24:55] right in 1 Peter 5:3 feed the flock of
[24:57] God which is among you taking the
[25:00] oversight thereof not by constraint but
[25:02] willingly not for filthy lucer but of
[25:05] ready mind and you got to you got to
[25:08] have a Shepherd because in Matthew 9
[25:11] when Jesus saw all the multitudes
[25:13] running around they didn't he said uh he
[25:15] he said there there there he said he saw
[25:17] the multitudes he was moved with
[25:19] compassion on them because they fainted
[25:21] and were scattered abroad as sheep
[25:23] having no Shepherd without a leader who
[25:26] what are they going to do if some some
[25:28] false Doctrine comes in what Jesus was
[25:30] concerned about him because they didn't
[25:32] have somebody to keep them in unity to
[25:35] keep them headed in the right direction
[25:37] to keep them going to protect and
[25:39] correct and guide and feed and care for
[25:41] them now look what happens without a
[25:43] Shepherd without a Shepherd the Sheep
[25:46] don't have their basic needs without a
[25:48] Shepherd they don't have there's nobody
[25:50] to care for the weak somebody gets out
[25:52] of line there's nobody to go visit them
[25:53] at their home or in the hospital
[25:56] somebody they don't have a Shepherd
[25:57] there's everybody gets all fearful and
[25:59] have have a bunch of anxiety just the
[26:01] presence of a Shepherd can calm the
[26:03] flock down just because he's there they
[26:06] got somebody there without a Shepherd
[26:08] they just get all spiritually stagnated
[26:11] sheep would be confined to overgrazed
[26:13] areas or poor terrain they're not
[26:15] they're not positioned in the right way
[26:17] they don't have any direction somebody
[26:18] to keep them going in the right
[26:19] direction they're vulnerable to
[26:21] predators and here's the big one without
[26:24] a without a Shepherd the Sheep begin to
[26:27] scatter
[26:28] now in the natural sheep go sheep will
[26:31] start going every which way but in the
[26:33] spiritual what happens without a
[26:34] Shepherd as you begin to scatter in your
[26:36] mind with divisiveness and disunity
[26:39] because you everybody begins to start
[26:41] thinking about different way I I think
[26:43] it should go this way I think it should
[26:44] go that way and you start you begin to
[26:47] get disunity you begin to get divided
[26:50] and that's what happens without a
[26:51] Shepherd right Shepherds bring unity in
[26:55] Acts chapter 20 Paul said take heed
[27:00] therefore unto yourselves and to all the
[27:01] flock over which the Holy Ghost hath
[27:03] made you overseers de feed the Church of
[27:06] God which he hath purchased with his own
[27:07] blood for I know this I think this was
[27:10] Paul actually I'm not sure anyway it's
[27:13] right here in Acts 20 for I know this
[27:16] that after my no this is Jesus speaking
[27:18] for I know this that after my departing
[27:20] shall Grievous clo wolves enter in among
[27:22] you not sparing the flock also of your
[27:25] own selves shall men arise speaking
[27:27] perverse things to draw away disciples
[27:29] after them now I'm I'm talking about
[27:31] Unity here in John chapter 10 he said I
[27:34] am the Good Shepherd and and and just
[27:37] skipping down he said another sheep I
[27:39] have which are not of this fold them
[27:41] also I must bring and they shall hear my
[27:44] voice and there shall be one fold and
[27:47] one Shepherd and I'm a few seconds over
[27:50] time so we're going to stop there
[27:52] Shepherds bring Unity amen God bless you
[27:56] Saints
[27:58] [Applause]
