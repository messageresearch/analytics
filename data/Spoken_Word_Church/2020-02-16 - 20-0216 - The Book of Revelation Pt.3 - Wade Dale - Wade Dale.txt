TRANSCRIPT
========================================
well you can't that's all play by the time o'clock excited five minutes but it'll revert all the way back to the so I got a stop at 10 10 10 10 next we got a good crowd I told you it's gonna be be kind of scrunched and that's okay Danny I wish you save that seat so much yeah I need to that's not okay anyway we'll find Z bars all right we're in the random Book of Revelations we went through the first chapter and what we're going to do is I want you to read the trkage book each individual one I mean at the individual sermons not to Facebook the surveys series alright and then what we're going to do is I'm not going to spend a lot of time with each one as far as the characteristics we're going to look at what the scripture says but then we're going to back up and go through like brother Branham did I mean really we just need to highlight brother I'm covered every Church age thoroughly how he came up with the dates how he came up with the ministers of that time and and we will spend time doing that I want to get on over into the book of Revelation because the church ages even y'all that came out of that Sunday School class y'all just came don't you don't go to church agents in there weren't you yeah so be fresh in your mind and I love the research AIDS book and I know y'all have to read it too but make sure you listen to the read the individual sermons okay so let's start with verse 18 I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore amen and have the keys of hell and death Rock these things down this scene so what was John commissioned to do John was commissioned to write what he see when he was seeing okay there's only one time he can try what do you see it and that's special for me and you in the end time okay dub I got help we'll get that Revelations 10 write the things which thou has seen and the things which are and the things which shall be Hereafter the mystery of the Seven Stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the Seven golden candlesticks these seven stars are the angels our messengers so there are seven different specific hey baby like a little ninja seven different distinct and individual messengers to each age we didn't know them until a prophet of God came in the end time and trouble to teach one I was named because like I said before I don't think Paul I knew you know Paul probably knew he was the beginning of something but that he was the ephesian church age messenger I doubt he knew that Iranians none of these new because remember even Luke and Wesley they passed away before it was denominated but they knew that there was a great where I going home but now we still got Lutheranism and this morning I was privileged that he could have Methodist Church and the Brotherhood so on John Wesley and the founder of their of their faith and each one has a different time but I'm telling you even as we're talking upstairs and we'll talk about this afternoon finish up on revival Paul didn't begin to revive in Ephesians urging the people be one man has never started now there's a man that has spearheaded but not started remember in a revival it started Luther's revival began when the people got enough of the Catholic Church and then God anointed Martin Luther to preach a message and then the people come out right same thing will mean you same thing with what's got to happen today you and I have to all mortal revival and not one man's gonna spearheaded right no no that's over that's over brother round spearheading the healing revival right but it was because I told you before he proved that God set a healing ministry during the early part of the 1900s because the medicine wasn't keeping up with the sickness nobody got that mm-hmm yes so the call for the people was God we don't have everything we don't have a hospital so on every corner that treats every little illness back in the nightmare hundreds in the early 1800 so the people cried out for a heating minister the people cried out for God to heal them right so God send somebody to spearhead that and we know that brother um did that but then he also brought his message that's for the people that's where people don't give him credit with continuing on with a revival that were under which is the word provider right right but the healing revival started because people were sick and they couldn't get relief from the doctor so they started crying out for - listen that's my brother I said the bride does better under persecution we're not persecuted today now this is not you might have little problems dynein persecution persecution is like this when you claim during Columbus Age when when they put you in prison it wasn't to judge you it was to kill you there was no judgment the judgment was you went into the lion's den or you went into the arena and you died you know because you were Christian so that was and we'll go through that with the characteristics of each church aid so he gives us seven different men mm-hmm and he gives us seven count sticks because look and don't get me wrong you're the same bedding separate he has the stars in his hand and then he's got this but now it's not the Holy Ghost in that one person makes the Holy Ghost into people crying out for someone ending God anoints a spearhead or annoyance the seven men to bring the message well who carries on the message listen brother I've been dead for 60 years 55 years see 12 years some like that 1965 minutes even day a long time 55 years but his message is stronger now than it was then there was no message churches everywhere when he was here right what they are now so who's caring they don't the people the voice because remember the Bible says revelations 10 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel but you've got to declare that in the days of the voice of the first messenger but now you got to remember revelation 10 seven different because it says the mystery one ministry we're going to be finished Paul didn't finish a mystery Irina's didn't finish a mystery they finished a mystery for their age but not a final mission on a final mystery there were many mysteries and remember down in this middle church age we'll read it you got a name but you're dead and all these different things but you know what God just kept on moving what through the people Columba died before his church age even started so it had to be the people that took the message and went into that church age with that message so it's always going to be the people it wasn't one man message at one time it's not anymore it's a mini membered body of Jesus Christ all one-man ministries are gone serve their purpose but it's the voice that carried on behind it the same way with paul iranians martin because they came to remember that messenger comes as the nba's paul come with the ate into the age of pentecost to bring the message to ephesus brought a great and powerful message well I think he died 166 1866 somewhere in there 69-66 Paul's dead in the for 8170 way before so who carries on his vessel the people until they don't yes well until until the fall in a white stars until the following the light starts blaster anthias saying the Jesus one guard you know the end of God or a single person and I rainiest here's is they're in the same house together and Iranians runs out the door and soo ain't gonna be in there with that guy so it's got me you know drop the house down on top of it because of its message will say that message came to Iranian support pure unadulterated word came them to Iranian for his age but it was for his age you and I yes for our age but here's where we're supposed to be we're supposed to be up here not entertaining and we're supposed to be up here coming out of Turkey but let's read them two characteristic you got sick excuse me about seven angel for seven messengers and seven Church ages and it's the oil in every Church age the Holy Spirit in every Church age leading the people through the messenger thank God excuse me God set on the earth to bring the message to everybody got them so you are a recipient of the seventh angels message all right but we have a second part of that seventh angels message according to the church age book you and I have a second part of that that we're supposed to fulfil the seven thunders we're supposed to be the voice of God in the age we're supposed to carry this thing on to the coming of the Lord not another church age not another messenger were to carry this thing home sweeping on brother Graham said to the coming of the Lord revelations 1080s eleven messenger left you know there's no messenger I've got that that's running the book and John is the type of look John is a type of every person how great is that he's a type of every if there's a million in each one of these just stay for a number then John time to all seven million bride wow what a great thing I slaying Commission John to write when he saw the things which are and the things which shall be Hereafter now see that's a great thing right there we got to realize in our mind the Bible the way you're looking at the Bible was not written until right in here 1500 was when the Bible was compiled and you're able to read it read 1 John 1 read what this was not less and it was scattered all through hearing different things but as it was put into a library by 10 Dale and some of the different ones in the 1500 then they started reading the Bible my point is you and I have come to a place we've got the full Bible we've got the full prophets message that reveals the Bible right excuse me and it tells us every characteristic every Church agents have lasted and every Church and messenger that's what God wanted to reveal but he had her a villain in the last decade so this is when we needed yes think about that mark mark listen Martin Luther's not responsible for John Wesley the doctor he died he can't do anything about that he was responsible for back here he was trying to see look peer word peer word getting a little worse get a little worse Brown said Dark Ages just saying you're a Christian put you to death right then Martin Luther comes out the people's crying out for a deliverer because they've been to only dark ages dark ages for a thousand years here come from Martin Luther program so it was a little bit of like you weren't responsible listen he went responsible for taking us back to Paul because he did he's still baptized named father-son home go he's still baptized night falls on home go early church still baptized name falls on going on that's not what Paul breaks but they weren't required to take us back to here Malachi 4 was required to take us back to the faith of the Father that's why it fell on brother branham to preach the lay the doctrine of trinitarianism eternal hell all the different things that had come into view that these people were not responsible to take us back here but now this man right here according to my account for he's to turn the heart of the father's to the children and the children babies back to the Pentecostal father's what word about giving them Lord Jesus Christ no Trinitarian doctrine they didn't have those things back here okay sure they were little sayings that went out but until they come up in 300 and 600 AD and I see you you didn't have any of that we'll see Luther then was required to bring a church out under the just shall live by faith no no means no he'll marries don't say this all that no works all right but by faith the just shall live by faith that's all he was required not to carry us back to him John Wesley because I'm saying telling you this when we read this we'll see how God said these church faith to that John Wesley sure he'd built on Luther but he didn't preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost like the Pentecostal did don't actually call me winners don't green tea don't drink this don't do this don't do that right and he wasn't required to take us back to here right right but this man in this church ain't here he's required according to Malachi 4:2 carry us all the way back to start down here and work our way up not to but look not to fall as they did before but to go from here watch go from here the cornerstone to the ystem that's the whole key right we're headstone people but we had to be brought back to here this is not the foundation part of the wall this is not the foundation part of the building but when he's required this this spirit is required to take us back to the foundation now we start building the buildings rid of all had to clean off the building the tenant and start on the foundation that was built and built this all the way up so that's our requirement why did or not we're not another J we can't go in another Martin Luther we can't going under John Wesley we can't go in under evening campaign that just gives you healed I just makes me feel good but that's only temporary when he takes us back to the faith of the fathers but he's took us back to word we're talking about power these people had power in the Word of God why because they didn't have all the screw holes that you and I have to deal with all right so let's start reading a little bit and read the characteristics of these church age like I said but I'm gonna stop just a minute come in but I'll review the church ages later on when we come back all right oh and next time your brother Joe will be doing the same school he'll be another Dutch Scott then on March the 20th I think we're late we're going I don't think I know we're going to Oklahoma for a few days doesn't see brother Claus until the unto the Angel of the Church of the Epis Ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks Oh who's they God right listen guts in every Church a memories in the mix with his outstretched hands and it's just as powerful this way as it is this way God doesn't diminish power as he has his hands going out no no he grows more and more because remember our church will be the most powerful Church because we're we're heading toward a body change not just a resurrection who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks I know that works and remember this is First Church age a pure Church a one that giant dummy one that Paul said up John is writing about and then remember John when he gets finished on Patmos he goes back to a decision and he passed through the church until he dies but what does he do he carries on what Paul started he didn't bring a new message that's a problem with today everybody's want to bring a new message but they think this guy's not the one to do it they're trying to bring their own new message of something different no what no listen seven starts seven messengers they had to be seven people put on this earth with a characteristic to lead the church age I don't care who you are these people that deny they just brother Brown even they think the other person are they're looking for somebody else both Wayne got time to start looking for somebody yeah we got to start believing that it's already here look I got firewood they met to this this morning Yeah right they with us you know you got scared run out the door I know that works and thy labour he's telling hey I know what you do I know what's going on and that patience and how thou canst not bear them what you're able like serenity it's an Iranian of course Iran stood at the end of the Iranians does come at the end of the of the exodus church age and brings a message but why is he bringing from he brings it from Paul brings him back worried that later on the ballot right now can thou canst not bear them which are evil and thou has tried them which say they are possible dead or not like the different ones reading the Bible reading the book of Acts who was that there was Simon the Tanner and all these different ones that followed you know followed the message of the day who was the one the sorcerer he wanted to buy him he wanted to you know he see people getting the Holy Ghost and he says let me buy some of that Paul said Peter once says Simon I know what's in your heart come to one time simon says in the bible he says give can you give me the Holy Ghost so that I can lay my hands on other people they gave me but they knew God knew his heart that he was going to get the glory not God so God so Peter said now you're not ready for this in other words and if you'll notice once that happened you never hear that again it's just like period and then God starts with something else do you have always time on people that are wasting time now has tried then we'll say the apostle there or not and has found them liars and has borne all right we know what that is persevered and has patience and for my name's sake no look my name the name wasn't long in the first church age the name got lost on up here you'll see in a little while till they baptized right when brother Branham stands up and he says bring me in hit all of history before Nicaea which is three real three hundred somewhere in there 300 AD 325 thank you ad when they had the nice thing company said show me anywhere in history where anybody was baptizing anything other than the name of the Lord Jesus Christ or Jesus Christ that's what he's saying you have kept my name the name was kept in the first couple of church ages and for my name's sake hast laboured and has fainted nevertheless now look he's talk he listen he is not talking to the world he's talking to the people in the church right that's why I'm telling you when we look at the plan we call a revival that's what let's tell them this morning we are looking for some great something to happen when it's kind of happening you further it's gotta happen in the individual first yes because this is God saying to me and you nevertheless I have somewhat against thing now he didn't say that you've lost your first love right you can't lose your salvation you can't let it once you're born again you have the love of God in your soul can't lose it but you left it you've one of the words you've moved away from it what was because what remember what does the room I will do it revives what's inside of you already not something external it revive what's inside God's calling them back to not to repent one of their sentence repent because you are no better same way with all of us that's what we're talking about this afternoon listen you'll know if there's a revival starting life because like that black realized I'm sorry brother thank you realize that there was something off we was in a position that he knew that God was dealing with his heart right now you may call it salvation whatever you want to call it doesn't matter he realized something when right and when you realize that something's not right and you know as well as I do I don't go for laundry list but I'm telling you if you should still don't pay your tithe not in a revival you're not even boarding it yeah it's basic but if you've left you first love cold to miss morning won't name a little method this they looked at me a little strength I said look you should be reading your Bible like I said if you read it blue devil if you read your Bible thirty minutes today read in an hour giving out 30 more minutes of your time we're not asking for something I'm not asking for you to go outside and and you know it's like I always say everybody puts the Ten Commandments out in the art the devil laughs at that the devil literally laughs it putting ten commandments out in your garden you can put them in stone I saw one time when they had one it was in really and marble how to be light shining moment but if that's not in here say don't care you can put you can put it in front of them the white house if you want to say I'm just gonna go high but it's gotta be in here somewhere with a revival you'd not post a big banner out somewhere right there will laugh at that then but when you start doing things that you don't normally do there are four god that's a revival that satan can't stand he can understand that that's the party kingston that has born in patience and for my name's sake hast laboured and hast not fainted nevertheless I have somewhat now he's got somewhat jars not gonna watch this church age off he's still feeling the people with the Holy Ghost listen listen to this when they accepted the Father Son Holy Ghost baptism he's still filled with the hose all right don't tell me John well actually what fool the holy God Martin Luther when full of the Holy Mother Brown fan these are seven stars in God's hands but he winked at the ignorance of man that had started these doctrines in God it was so prevalent he says okay I got somewhat against you I'm gonna allow that until because my Bible says Satan saying this is what my Bible says the one that wrote the Bible's right here and he said that there would be a ministry coming the endtime that would take us back to him so they weren't required we are required they weren't required click on somewhat see what well there's no it's not underlined anything mm-hmm anything that you see this see it's the towel size there is no that's exactly what it says in the original okay everybody got there there is no strong concordance of a different definition of someone because some what means what part I have somewhat against you there's something I have against you not everything like thing he's not gonna erase the church age but now he does tell them own down here another church and he said if you don't repent I may pull your candlestick out that's lunch remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the what the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and rule their news and will remove thy candlestick out of its place except thou repent well they must have repented cup the candlestick stayed there right but this thou hast that thou hatest see that's the part of some what he didn't like this part but this party really likes you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans and so do i they were getting organized in here and the power was on the pit of the preacher nothing people right and the people remember it started as a deed a little a little oh say well what about this what Jesus couldn't be really God and man at the same time he's got to be that that God standing up hearing he creates this other body in he makes this son and then that son then there's a Holy Ghost over here with a little dove you know fluttering around like brother so that's just a saying deed it becomes a doctrine later yes in James it says when lust is conceived it bringeth forth sin when sin is finished it bring it forth death all right so we'll go right here and then we'll stop for this Tim 12 we're going up there but this thou hath thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans which i also hate he too has an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God you see that that's a promise all the way to the future home because the tree life's not in the Millennium the tree lost in the future home read your Bible all right we know we're part of the tree a lot but tree alive Jesus Christ is going to be standing right there eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God let's go [Music]
