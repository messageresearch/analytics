[0:00] let's read here in Romans chapter six
[0:02] what shall we say then shall we continue
[0:04] in sin that grace may abound policy god
[0:08] forbid how shall we that are dead to sin
[0:12] live any longer therein no you not did
[0:15] so many of us as were baptized into
[0:17] Jesus Christ were baptized into his
[0:19] death that's why it's the death burial
[0:22] resurrection so I told them in the
[0:24] building we were going to a killing
[0:26] that's what it is we're going to we're
[0:27] going to go to killing we're gonna kill
[0:28] an old person because right here what
[0:31] they said therefore we are buried with
[0:33] him by baptism into death then like as
[0:36] Christ was raised up from the dead by
[0:38] the glory of the Father even so we also
[0:40] should walk in newness of life for if we
[0:44] have been planted together in the
[0:46] likeness of his death that's what we're
[0:47] gonna do wanna plant but we're not going
[0:50] to leave them down there bring them out
[0:51] for if we have been planted together in
[0:54] the likeness of his death we shall be
[0:56] also in the likeness of his resurrection
[0:59] knowing this that our old man is
[1:02] crucified with him that the body of sin
[1:04] might be destroyed that henceforth we
[1:07] should not serve sin for he that is dead
[1:09] is freed from sin now if we be dead with
[1:13] Christ we believe that we shall also
[1:15] live with him knowing that Christ being
[1:18] raised from the dead dies no more death
[1:20] have no more dominion over him brenn
[1:23] that he died he died unto sin once but
[1:26] then that he liveth he liveth unto God
[1:29] likewise
[1:30] so Paul give that summation of Christ
[1:33] likewise reckon ye also yourself to be
[1:36] dead indeed unto sin but alive it to God
[1:39] through Jesus Christ our Lord
[1:43] that's what we're gonna do with a go
[1:45] death burial and resurrection then we're
[1:50] gonna walk in newness of life all right
[1:53] I agree man we're all witnesses today so
[1:58] let's go to the promised land
[2:41] just told us he said going to the whole
[2:43] of the world preach the gospel baptizing
[2:47] in the name of the Father and of the Son
[2:48] and of the Holy Ghost
[2:49] so our sister has come in repentance to
[2:53] be baptized according to Christian
[2:56] baptism so today we baptize our sister
[2:59] Warren Snipes in the name of the Lord
[3:03] Jesus Christ
[3:39] I know our sister so today to fulfill
[3:50] the Great Commission that Jesus told us
[3:52] to go in all the world preach the gospel
[3:55] baptizing in the name of the Father and
[3:57] of the Son and of the Holy Ghost we
[3:59] baptize our sister extra-small wood in
[4:02] the name of the lord jesus christ
