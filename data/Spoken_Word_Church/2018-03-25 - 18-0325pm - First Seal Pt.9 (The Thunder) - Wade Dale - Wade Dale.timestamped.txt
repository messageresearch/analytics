[17:43] amen show me the odds of our
[17:46] understanding being lightened today and
[17:49] good to be in the house of Lord good to
[17:51] be back in the saddle I guess you might
[17:55] say it's good to have brothers come in
[17:58] that's fivefold ministry Park but it's
[18:01] good to sit down and just have a little
[18:05] fellowship with their home folks here so
[18:08] good to be here
[18:10] good to have our friend with us there
[18:12] from from Alabama and bless her heart
[18:16] she's got to go back to Alabama anyway
[18:19] people get converted and they come to
[18:21] Georgia so that's okay yes there's a
[18:23] there's no you tell brother Jonathan I
[18:27] said that but good to have them with us
[18:30] today
[18:31] you got your Bibles let's start back
[18:33] with revelation 6 verse 1 and brother
[18:38] Danny's not here to bring my board out
[18:42] so I'll get it in a minute so remember
[18:45] all the announcements brother Chris will
[18:46] be here this week this Wednesday night
[18:49] looking forward to next Sunday as Easter
[18:51] so make sure you bring your Easter crowd
[18:53] with you because a lot of our crowds
[18:54] gonna be gone ok anyway just remember
[19:02] saying remember the ones that are
[19:03] traveling really they're going to the
[19:04] youth camp which is fine it's ok no
[19:06] problem that but they go into the youth
[19:08] camp in Louisiana so it's the long
[19:11] journey been there before I've been
[19:12] there done
[19:13] got the t-shirt so don't didn't go back
[19:17] either but it's good to get the kids out
[19:21] let them let them have a little fun we
[19:22] were all kids at one time I wish we'd
[19:24] have had them a little bit more when I
[19:25] was growing up but remember Easter
[19:28] Sunday though next Sunday we'll we'll be
[19:29] right here fighting the good fight of
[19:32] faith remember also please remember
[19:33] Jim's dad he has pancreatic and if you
[19:37] don't know what that is your pant he has
[19:39] been sick for a week the man is 83 years
[19:41] old he's been sick for a week and he's
[19:45] not sick he's good shape for 83 years
[19:47] old but your pancreas produces the
[19:50] enzymes to break down your food well
[19:51] he's been throwing up and diarrhea for a
[19:53] week and that's not good for a young
[19:56] strong man much less an older gentleman
[19:58] so keep him in your prayers he's back in
[19:59] the hospital but you know what the Lord
[20:01] knows all things and he'll work it to
[20:03] his good always they mint so remember
[20:06] all these other member Jim - she's
[20:08] watching in she stayed up till 5 o'clock
[20:10] this morning with the bronchitis and
[20:12] she's she's just completely exhausted so
[20:14] just remember her just keep us on your
[20:16] prayers devil would love to just kill us
[20:20] all he would love it that's why the
[20:23] angel of the lords and Captain bound us
[20:25] like brother Ernie was saying there's
[20:27] angels here right here with you when you
[20:31] get up in the morning while you're
[20:32] sleeping there's an angel watching over
[20:34] you you you're the heirs of
[20:37] righteousness right then there's an
[20:39] angel giving charge to watch over you
[20:41] amen and we know what we know the end of
[20:46] the story Wars already won we've got a
[20:50] few battles we got to have before we get
[20:52] out of here so that's what we're trying
[20:53] to do we're trying to get out of here so
[20:55] revelation 6 verse 1 and let's go to the
[20:58] Lord in prayer before we go to Heavenly
[21:00] Father we pray Lord today that you will
[21:02] truly as we always say and not not just
[21:05] as we say it for a repetition you'd be
[21:07] the active participant in this service
[21:09] you'd be the one that does the speaking
[21:11] you'd be the one that does the hearing
[21:12] you're the only one that can give
[21:14] revelation and that's what we feed on
[21:17] father just like we feed on natural food
[21:19] we as the bride of Jesus Christ in this
[21:21] endtime we love eagle food we love
[21:24] Revelation father so give
[21:25] today Lord and bountiful amounts to each
[21:29] and every one we bind all the sickness
[21:33] by your word that's come among this
[21:36] people that you'll move it out father
[21:39] take care of each one of us Lord may we
[21:44] see something from you today and know
[21:48] that you're still king of kings and Lord
[21:50] of lords and that you have decided by
[21:55] your own plan to come down here and
[21:57] dwell not just with us but in us and
[21:59] you've told us in your word that
[22:02] whatever we ask in your name that'll be
[22:05] given to us so in the name of Jesus
[22:06] Christ I prayed that you would just bind
[22:08] all the sickness in this service and
[22:10] even the ones that are at home because
[22:13] distance means nothing to you father
[22:15] bless the little bride around the world
[22:17] Lord give the wonderful wonderful ones
[22:22] that overseas and the ones that are
[22:24] doing work Lord just give a fruit for
[22:26] the labor father just bless each one
[22:28] take care of us now as we read your word
[22:31] sanctifies for this journey father in
[22:33] Jesus name we pray amen
[22:36] revelation 6 verse 1 and I saw when the
[22:39] lamb opened one of the seals and I heard
[22:41] as it were the noise of thunder one of
[22:44] the four beasts saying come and see
[22:47] and I saw him behold a white horse and
[22:49] he that sat on him out of bow and a
[22:51] crown was given unto him and he went
[22:52] forth conquering and to conquer he may
[22:55] be seated in the Lord at his blessing to
[22:56] the reading of the word shake somebody's
[23:00] hands thank god bless you while I'm
[23:01] doing this man it's cold in there they
[23:09] ain't nothing like a cold preacher
[23:10] that's bad that room and there's cold
[23:12] somebody who put that in there get
[23:15] cramps do you put that in there okay
[23:18] whoever no sir I like him no sir whoever
[23:21] did needs to figure out how the heat
[23:23] works cold and later that's why I have
[23:27] water and it's warm up here dry cold
[23:30] preachers are not good
[23:35] I'll tell y'all shaking hands say god
[23:37] bless you okay do it again god bless
[23:39] double blessing anyway that what we're
[23:46] talking today we're if you pull that
[23:48] back out one more time we're gonna look
[23:50] today I'm going to go background a
[23:52] little bit forgive me I got a little
[23:54] build a call for myself but we're going
[23:56] to background and we're going to talk
[23:57] just a few moments about the Thunder but
[24:00] we got to do a little background first
[24:02] now you see what's on the board on the
[24:04] board is the seven church ages one -
[24:06] this is for this is for Nikki only one
[24:09] two three four five
[24:12] hello one two three four five six seven
[24:15] seven Church ages alright but we're
[24:17] talking about the seals and the seals we
[24:20] put them you can't work them one per
[24:22] each Church age because remember in the
[24:25] fourth seal the rapture takes place
[24:29] hey man I'm telling you what the Prophet
[24:31] said we got there yet but the rapture
[24:34] takes place on the fourth seal will the
[24:35] force that we know the rapture didn't
[24:37] take place in the fourth church age the
[24:40] rapture took plate takes place in this
[24:41] age amantha 7 at the end of the SEM of
[24:44] church aid you and I are to receive a
[24:46] message amen and we've received that
[24:51] message and we're getting ready to go in
[24:52] the rapture which the rapture does take
[24:54] place on the fourth seal which shows
[24:56] that then we can look and see that the
[24:58] lion ox man and eagle which are
[25:01] characteristics of the Holy Ghost amen
[25:06] the prophet of God said the lion age was
[25:09] basically the first three ages the OPP's
[25:12] age was that fourth age why because
[25:14] remember to just say you were a
[25:16] Christian that killed you ox is a beast
[25:19] of burden ox is a labor they labored in
[25:22] that church agent and all they didn't
[25:24] have the power of the gifts and the
[25:25] power sure they had things working in
[25:27] their life amen but they were
[25:29] slaughtered by the millions for just
[25:30] what they believed and then look at me
[25:33] and you we got it so easy but they could
[25:36] just if they were meeting in a room and
[25:37] they were caught they were all killed
[25:38] they didn't have to they didn't go
[25:40] through a judge jury and whatever they
[25:43] were just taking straight to Rome thrown
[25:45] in with the lines and you were done so
[25:48] that aunts age was a labor then the man
[25:51] age come up into what Lutheran Wesley
[25:53] which we brought printing presses and
[25:56] all the things the intelligence of man
[25:59] come in those two ages to bring us what
[26:01] the written Bible and all those things
[26:03] together but also we got to remember in
[26:05] this eighth in this these two ages the
[26:08] denominations rose up man's idea apart
[26:13] from God come up in those two ages amen
[26:18] there wasn't a denomination in any of
[26:20] these ages over here
[26:21] sure Catholicism rose up and came
[26:24] through but there was not a litter to
[26:28] have the Lutheran doctrine there wasn't
[26:30] a Wesley to have the west wing or the
[26:31] Methodists or Pentecost they had to come
[26:34] in to these church ages and these church
[26:36] ages are important because it lines
[26:38] everything up and we'll look at the end
[26:39] of the service and then this last stage
[26:43] was is the Eagle age or the Eagle
[26:45] anointing and just like we were saying
[26:47] last Sunday watch a line that's very
[26:49] strong now this is just for Nicky
[26:51] because everybody's here listening the
[26:55] lion is very strong but when he becomes
[26:59] that when he comes into this world as a
[27:00] baby the line has to drink milk and man
[27:04] the Ox when it comes into the world it
[27:07] drinks milk yet it yet man nothing to
[27:09] pull a house down if it really needed to
[27:11] it would have some strength to it and it
[27:13] had a labor to it it was a laborious
[27:15] animal and then man guess what when
[27:17] man's born I'm talking to you when man
[27:19] is born when man is born guess what we
[27:23] can eat meat but not when we're baby hey
[27:26] man we have to start out drinking milk
[27:28] but now in the Eagle Age the Eagle never
[27:32] drinks milk hello even as a baby momma
[27:37] Eagle choose the big chunks of food up
[27:40] kills the animal that's what preachers
[27:43] do kills the animal breaks down the food
[27:46] puts it in the little eagle's mouth and
[27:48] then when the Eagle matures guess what
[27:50] he can do the same thing he can chew up
[27:53] the pieces and then take it in and
[27:55] swallow it and then give it to the other
[27:57] little baby Eagles hey man so we as this
[28:00] churches grow
[28:02] and grace and knowledge and I was
[28:04] telling somebody the other day you know
[28:06] thank God for teaching because you can
[28:10] take what brother Dale said this morning
[28:12] and you to someone that is a novice
[28:14] that's very very very very very
[28:16] confusing thank God for teaching I don't
[28:20] know how in the world you can get it
[28:21] without listening you can't get you know
[28:24] brother Branham that's fine to listen to
[28:27] tapes but say somebody got to teach you
[28:30] there's somebody got to eat the strong
[28:34] meat break it down and like I said
[28:37] before I wish we could shove it down
[28:38] people through but you can it may choke
[28:42] them but that Eagle never had milk so
[28:44] he's we're in the age of strong meat
[28:46] we're in the age of where we can fly and
[28:48] see as far east west north and south
[28:51] amen
[28:52] the man can only go so high but his
[28:54] intelligence takes him higher but it
[28:56] will not take him higher than an eagle
[28:57] because if a man goes any higher he's
[29:00] got to get in the machine come on people
[29:02] he's got to get sure the intelligence
[29:05] puts us in a in an airplane and shoots
[29:07] us up 32,000 feet but an eagle doesn't
[29:10] need a machine he can get up there
[29:12] pretty high without a machine in his
[29:14] natural natural in our understanding the
[29:19] eagle can fly higher than anything a man
[29:22] not what man has produced but what God
[29:25] has given the anointing of an eagle to
[29:29] you and I so that's what you and I must
[29:31] look at in these seals we see the first
[29:34] seal we show that this is for sister
[29:37] Nicci for the first three ages the
[29:40] second seal would be for lap overs of
[29:43] the third fourth fifth days and then the
[29:45] third seal would be lap over in the
[29:48] fifth and sixth and then the sixth and
[29:50] seventh everybody got that same an
[29:51] alright first seal which is the wild
[29:54] horse rider red horse rider black horse
[29:56] rider and pale horse rider and then and
[29:59] we're getting ready and I want you to
[30:01] watch this today we're getting ready to
[30:02] move in next Sunday into the second seal
[30:06] which which it evolves from a white
[30:08] horse remember Satan rides a white horse
[30:12] because he's deceptive
[30:14] he's riding something so close and we're
[30:17] gonna see it in Revelations and I
[30:19] remember the bible's time I tell the day
[30:21] I've never really seen that before how
[30:23] many times you read the scripture and
[30:24] think man that wasn't there when I read
[30:26] it last time okay same thing with the
[30:28] message you reading imagine you go I
[30:30] brother Brown didn't say that yeah he
[30:31] did read it again so you say what he did
[30:33] but what we're doing we're seeing with
[30:35] what with more understanding alright so
[30:38] we see the understanding of these first
[30:40] three ages was the Ephesian age and
[30:42] we'll see something real real striking
[30:45] because the ephesian church and the
[30:47] Laodicean church are that Alpha and
[30:50] Omega bride name am the Alpha and Omega
[30:53] bride so so there has to be a mirror
[30:55] image or the two bookends has to come
[30:57] together and then we have to get back to
[31:00] the faith of the fathers which was in
[31:02] these ages here there was no
[31:04] denomination here they all started over
[31:06] here all right and remember like we read
[31:09] last Sunday about whether the Father Son
[31:13] Holy Ghost doctrine came from it came
[31:15] from the pits of hell so I wasn't a god
[31:17] thing alright and I was telling bro
[31:20] Louise we'll we'll look at it truly will
[31:22] read what brother Branham said he said
[31:24] the Holy Ghost has been bound for 2,000
[31:27] years not by the Christian but by
[31:32] Creed's and denominations but it's to be
[31:35] loosed in the end time we'll read that a
[31:37] man so the Holy Ghost can be bound it
[31:41] can be grieved it can be bound and it
[31:45] can be grieved that meant you and I are
[31:47] still free moral agents though we are
[31:49] Christians we're still free moral agents
[31:50] hey man
[31:51] so now let's look and see you we talked
[31:55] about when you talk about the seal and
[31:56] I'll tell us at the end when we talk
[31:58] about the Thunder but remember go to the
[32:00] next slide we got to remember the sales
[32:04] is Redemption Redemption Redemption
[32:06] Redemption hey man only the redeemed can
[32:11] even understand what we're talking about
[32:13] amen hey man that's all that's going to
[32:16] be there look this is the redeemed of
[32:19] the earth and then that was 120 in the
[32:23] upper room they were redeemable
[32:27] therefore they were redeemed a man you
[32:32] and I I was telling you the other day
[32:35] you know hey I want to say this just to
[32:40] clear something up you know we talked
[32:43] about we always was eternal and that's
[32:47] true but we come to it we have to come
[32:50] to understanding first that you're lost
[32:53] because you can't be redeemed
[32:56] unless you're lost there's nobody going
[32:59] to be sitting at the wedding supper
[33:01] I never was come on people believe I
[33:06] told brother Louis you ever thought
[33:07] about this you know brother Brennan said
[33:09] bride can't persecute bride right Holy
[33:13] Ghost cannot condemn or persecute the
[33:19] Holy Ghost what Paul do if Paul was
[33:25] always was eternal think about it if
[33:32] Paul was this always was eternal person
[33:34] I thought he said he caused those people
[33:39] to blasting which were the eternal which
[33:43] were the Christians of the day why did
[33:46] Paul we'll talk about lightning the
[33:48] turnitin minute why did Paul just not
[33:50] come down as the light and smack Paul
[33:53] and say Paul you always was eternal no
[33:55] he said Paul you're gonna be blind for
[33:58] three days because you don't know what
[34:00] you've been doing maybe you're starting
[34:03] to understand but he took the Holy Ghost
[34:06] filled preacher named Anna nice to meet
[34:11] with Paul and lay his hands only to
[34:14] receive the Holy Ghost
[34:16] you and I need Redemption you and I need
[34:20] the Holy Ghost to quicken the word look
[34:22] at Paul Paul knew the word why did he
[34:27] have to take the Old Testament go back
[34:29] into the desert after he saves the Holy
[34:31] Ghost if he always was now look in the
[34:34] mind of God
[34:37] I never was lost but just like I'm
[34:43] telling you like what brother Dale's
[34:45] telling you there's layers to this
[34:48] there's layers to this message let me
[34:53] give you a thought of a beekeeper I used
[34:59] to not be now we got people that we that
[35:03] when we go to our beekeeper meetings
[35:05] they only want to have to be half that's
[35:08] all they want
[35:10] okay I'm making a point here gobble
[35:14] beekeeping listen they only want to be
[35:16] how last one little old lady one day I
[35:18] said how's your hives she said they're
[35:20] fine I said have you been inside the box
[35:21] - look she says no I just sit down in
[35:23] front of me watch the bees go in and out
[35:25] and in and out and in and out and
[35:26] they're fine
[35:27] no they're not she's a bee have her
[35:31] she's not a beekeeper but that's all
[35:39] she's satisfied with it you can call her
[35:40] a beekeeper she's satisfied with two
[35:43] little white hives sitting in her
[35:44] backyard in the backyard
[35:46] okay that's somebody like me I have 35
[35:49] to 50 hives
[35:50] getting ready to have about 75 because
[35:52] you know what now I understand I hope
[35:55] y'all understand what I'm saying now I
[35:57] understand more about beekeeping so it's
[35:59] the same two hives bees do two things
[36:03] they pollinate and they reproduce that's
[36:06] it that's the basics of Christianity
[36:11] okay that's the basics of Christianity
[36:15] but I want more
[36:17] so I've got 50 hives now because I've
[36:21] took the two I had and I've what red I
[36:25] go to be meetings on Sunday and
[36:27] Wednesday
[36:29] [Applause]
[36:33] and I want to know more about this
[36:35] beekeeping thing but you know what my
[36:38] fifty hives has nothing compared to this
[36:42] guy Norg and it's got 15,000 beehive
[36:46] same two boxes same principle reproduce
[36:52] and make honey that's all they do
[36:54] he's just got in a bigger scale same way
[36:57] with the same way with you and I we
[36:59] start here with two boxes we're born
[37:03] again we're Christians but you can say
[37:06] that's enough hey man you can say that's
[37:10] enough for me I just like to watch them
[37:12] going in and out I just like to come and
[37:15] sit down and listen to a good sermon but
[37:19] there's others that want more they want
[37:21] more boxes of the same thing of the same
[37:26] thing same principle you don't lose your
[37:29] principle but pulse is leaving the
[37:32] principle of the doctrine of Christ let
[37:34] us go on to perfection
[37:36] amen so the breaking of these seals is
[37:39] my 15,000 hives compared to the two
[37:44] hives when I was a born again child a
[37:46] baby in Christ watching the bees go in
[37:49] and out going to church and reading my
[37:51] Bible studying hey man but we want more
[37:53] others want more I want to learn about
[37:57] rate I raise my own Queens now so I can
[38:00] do that and I can sell them you see what
[38:02] I'm saying same way with Christianity
[38:04] you get out of it what you put into it
[38:07] amen now obviously I don't want 15,000
[38:11] house but I do want 15,000 hives in the
[38:15] gospel hey man I want but it's still the
[38:18] same two boxes it still bees going in
[38:21] and out getting pollen and reproducing
[38:22] that's all you do
[38:23] same way with what brother Graham said
[38:25] go on with a same simple message but
[38:28] build on it amen
[38:33] so what gave you the new burns what
[38:35] brought you into the beekeeping
[38:37] community it's your desire to want more
[38:41] and to know more amen
[38:45] but it's the same two boxes it's the
[38:48] same justification sanctification the
[38:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost the same plan
[38:53] of redemption they save these people
[38:59] these people these people these people
[39:01] these people the only problem these
[39:03] people right here we have a problem well
[39:07] you can call it a problem there's no
[39:10] more Church ages we can't make no more B
[39:13] boxes we can't give it off to somebody
[39:17] else this is it coca-cola sister Nicci
[39:24] is not in Alabama Crimson Tide is
[39:28] definitely not it but God is it that's
[39:33] what we're looking for and if we don't
[39:35] then we're going to be like that old
[39:36] ladies sitting there watching them two
[39:37] beehives and one day she's gonna fall
[39:39] over dead but let's go on to perfection
[39:48] let's take this layer at a time
[39:53] layer at a time like Louise said this
[39:58] morning learn more about God if I want
[40:03] to be a good beekeeper guess what I'll
[40:04] stay up a couple hours and watch some
[40:07] bee videos why cuz I want to be better
[40:11] amen that Saint there is a Christian
[40:15] you want to be better listen hey listen
[40:21] I might play anytime I want to I don't
[40:23] have to tell me somebody I got a I got a
[40:25] match play on Sunday that hurt but to
[40:32] break into these seals is not
[40:35] necessarily for the soul because that
[40:36] woman sent in watching us to be how
[40:38] she's just as happy as the guy with
[40:40] 15,000 five because you know what she
[40:44] loves what she's doing
[40:45] she loves the Lord she loves gone and
[40:49] her soul is redeemed by the new birth
[40:52] the shed blood of Jesus Christ at
[40:54] Calvary that's the basics of everything
[40:56] amen
[40:59] but the opening of the word or the
[41:01] firmament of the word the seals will
[41:03] bring now full fellowship back into
[41:06] manifestation because look God's not
[41:08] satisfied the way it is and he's already
[41:12] laid it out there in 66 months we've got
[41:14] a 66 book instruction manual but God
[41:20] didn't stop there he sent a prophet
[41:21] added 1100 he added 1100 sermons in
[41:28] between them 66 books to give us the
[41:31] love letter to explain more clearly not
[41:35] what God didn't say but what God's
[41:38] already said hey man that's what these
[41:45] seals are for amen thereby alright say
[41:48] man we want full fellowship my desire is
[41:52] more fellowship with God and the only
[41:56] way to fit you can't fellowship with God
[41:57] and be keeping nothing I was just using
[41:59] that for an example but you can't he
[42:01] said you read my word brother and said
[42:06] how you get closer to God standing on
[42:07] your head drink more coca-cola dick
[42:11] could win no he said what steady and
[42:16] read your Bible I mean pray and read
[42:18] your Bible that's kind of like that
[42:20] scripture resist the devil and he will
[42:22] flee from you you know that's going to
[42:23] change our body that one scripture is
[42:28] going to change our body resist the
[42:30] devil and he will flee from you and not
[42:35] to what the property God did in 1963 he
[42:38] resisted all that denomination he
[42:41] resisted all that ideas that he'd had
[42:43] before and when he resisted that idea
[42:46] there was a wild horse rider there was a
[42:48] seal broke and when that seal broke that
[42:50] rider rode away because he has attacked
[42:55] Satan had a taxi
[42:57] self like I said before Satan has
[43:00] attached himself to Christianity hello
[43:04] what do you think he's that in the bar
[43:06] room no he's right here he's sitting
[43:09] beside you look over there but we won't
[43:16] full fellowship because you know what
[43:18] that should be our desire that's what
[43:20] comes out and then and in the breaking
[43:23] of these seals it's not some great
[43:25] mysterious something it's still the very
[43:27] simple plan of redemption justification
[43:29] sanctification about genital hole goes
[43:31] now look the baby form justification is
[43:33] not going to change your body but it is
[43:37] a part of your body change amen because
[43:43] there is a time that way they'll knew he
[43:47] was lost because the things I did God
[43:49] went with me I promise you that now he
[43:52] might he knew like I said before when we
[43:55] get in the seals like when we get up
[43:57] into here sure we ought to be able to
[43:59] look back to Genesis 1:26 and see where
[44:02] we came from see what we're doing here
[44:05] and see where we're going to me that's
[44:06] all the seals are it's telling us where
[44:08] we came from what we're doing here and
[44:10] where we're going very simple all right
[44:12] so we can look back and see that sure we
[44:14] were in the mind of God like I said
[44:16] before Paul was in the mind of God Paul
[44:18] was a prophet and I think brother Brown
[44:20] said the prophets are born prophets amen
[44:24] but why did Paul persecute those
[44:26] Christians if he had something inside of
[44:29] him that was eternal no way people I
[44:31] believe you have to receive something
[44:35] God has to come down and burn that old
[44:38] person out of your soul and now he
[44:42] resides
[44:48] he will not dwell in an unclean vessel
[44:54] I was unclean but now I'm clean I know
[44:58] I'm clean you know why know why I'm
[45:00] clean I can look back and see what I
[45:04] came from what I'm doing here and where
[45:08] I'm going hey man
[45:11] so now let's read number one about 30
[45:15] minutes cuz I'm gonna get out of here by
[45:16] 3:30 revelations chapter five number one
[45:22] see what it's doing is these seals
[45:25] opening up just begin to reveal the plan
[45:28] of the devil oh that's not what that's
[45:31] this because remember there is nowhere
[45:33] in Redemption that the devil is a part
[45:35] of except for he is your adversary he is
[45:41] the one that's driving you to that amen
[45:44] like I said before if Satan would have
[45:48] left Jesus alone brother Brown a saint
[45:51] would left Jesus alone he was trapped in
[45:52] that human body amen he looked 50 but he
[45:56] was 30 he could have just let him die
[45:59] and he'd just been one Jesus here that
[46:02] define but oh he couldn't do that he had
[46:06] to kill that man when he killed that man
[46:09] that's alright cuz I want to tell you
[46:12] Pentecost there was 120 little Jesus's
[46:15] bought so Satan had to deal with 121
[46:19] little Jesus's then 3,000 downstairs
[46:22] went into the body of Christ Satan had
[46:24] 3121
[46:26] Jesus has to deal with now he's got
[46:28] millions the poor thing every time he
[46:30] touches something he can't win for
[46:36] losing but it's those seals opening up
[46:40] just to begin to reveal the plan of
[46:42] redemption so that's what we're talking
[46:43] about what come with the plan of
[46:44] redemption we're not talking about some
[46:46] seventh under virtue message and some of
[46:49] this person's got to do this and that
[46:50] person's got to raise up and do this
[46:51] know the Holy Ghost is what's going to
[46:53] lead us through hey man
[46:55] if we find us a good Holy Ghost teacher
[46:57] he will lead us through a good Holy
[46:59] Ghost pastor I believe we found it we
[47:02] found him is here so wait a little look
[47:04] for him
[47:05] so we're at the end time these things
[47:08] are being
[47:08] reveal so you and I have to have a
[47:10] revelation number one that we were lost
[47:14] and that we were justified a gun chopped
[47:16] off our past sins they men but now we
[47:19] come though as we come through our
[47:21] journey listen to me as we come through
[47:23] our journey we see that that
[47:26] justification not only chopped off my
[47:28] past sense the real me didn't do it
[47:33] the one that now resides in my soul
[47:37] never sinned today don't who can hold to
[47:46] God's elect who can hold any mark
[47:49] because it's God that justifies a man
[47:53] now when you see that justification now
[47:56] that doesn't make you this tall that
[48:00] doesn't make you both fall I'm still a
[48:04] sinner brother Brent said I'm a sinner
[48:05] saved by grace and I'll remember that
[48:09] until the day my body's changed hey man
[48:12] I'll not forget that comes to me the
[48:15] plan of redemption is is for somebody to
[48:18] tell you you were lost but now through
[48:24] what I did not me I'm talking bout Jesus
[48:26] through Jesus and say what I did for you
[48:29] Susan for bush not for sister John for
[48:32] you that's why this is the personal
[48:35] revelation I told them before you want
[48:37] to know what the Seventh Seal is you
[48:39] know why there's silence
[48:41] anybody in this room except you tell me
[48:46] what my how I got converted and how God
[48:49] came to me and how that he spoke to me
[48:51] and the exact things he spoke to me you
[48:57] guys have been with me for a long time
[48:59] since somebody says brother Carly's been
[49:00] with me since I was a child tells you
[49:03] how old he is I mean a child but can you
[49:09] tell me my experience why because it's a
[49:13] personal revelation of what God has done
[49:17] for you
[49:20] I love to hear everybody's testimony but
[49:23] I like mine cuz it's personal now that
[49:27] silence in heaven because nobody can
[49:31] tell them you can I know you but I can't
[49:37] tell you what God did
[49:38] I'm sure I can see the things but I
[49:39] can't tell you the day that God saved
[49:42] your soul the day that God spoke to you
[49:44] I can't replicate that or duplicate that
[49:47] I have my own experience right well
[49:52] there's the end of the service let's go
[49:53] home
[49:55] but it's the Seventh Seal can't be any
[49:57] different it can't be anything higher
[49:59] than what we it can't be this we can
[50:02] have three wives heavenly days polygamy
[50:05] I don't want that revelation you boom
[50:08] are ones enough was enough
[50:10] one spleen but all these things that
[50:14] people have made it in the message it is
[50:15] your new birth it is that personal
[50:18] brother branham what is any birth it's
[50:20] why a revelation to Jesus Christ what
[50:22] personally to you the two big boxes
[50:25] we're back to reproduction and making
[50:28] honey
[50:30] revelation that God saved your soul you
[50:35] accept it and then he accepted what your
[50:38] faith amen remember it's not that you
[50:42] accept God it's God accepting you so God
[50:45] has to accept you through all this all
[50:48] these seals the white horse rider
[50:50] absolutely if there was a wild horse
[50:52] rider there had to be a white righteous
[50:55] church on the earth at the time that
[50:58] Satan begins his ride because remember
[51:01] Satan is not an originator sister Nicci
[51:03] Satan will never tell you something
[51:07] original he don't even have a seed to
[51:10] reproduce yourself he had to vicariously
[51:14] enter a beast to inject yourself in the
[51:20] human race
[51:25] but God just said let there be a man God
[51:30] just said let there be and you know what
[51:33] it came to pass Satan can stand down
[51:35] today he can say let there be
[51:37] let there be left everything they won't
[51:39] never happen how much power is that
[51:42] Satan has no power set what we give Him
[51:45] amen
[51:46] that all right say ma'am all right so we
[51:50] know now that the seals are the complete
[51:52] plan of redemption now the plan of
[51:54] redemption brother Dale's been talking
[51:55] about begins your journey amen towards
[52:01] your complete plan but you got to start
[52:03] somewhere like I was talking to him
[52:05] downstairs brother Lewis bringing the
[52:07] Sunday School really well it's just like
[52:11] me and you you know we we were talking
[52:13] back to people say well I'll tell you
[52:14] what brother Brown said after 63 and and
[52:16] and not before I said that same devil
[52:19] that same Devils in Delta it was down
[52:22] there when when they say oh it's just
[52:23] the Old Testament it was somebody taught
[52:27] that we thunk in one day and I was
[52:29] telling the sister I said sister I said
[52:30] Deuteronomy 29 says you need to wear
[52:33] clothes not pertaining to a man she saw
[52:35] us Old Testament I said what's them Ten
[52:38] Commandments you gotta turn your porch
[52:41] that we swear as Christians to go by
[52:45] that did that Old Testament here baby oh
[52:49] okay - no Testament so anyway so I mean
[52:53] really they get this new - lets the same
[52:55] thing same spirit let's all I'll tell
[52:57] you what brother mom said after 63
[52:58] listen that's just like me going to my
[53:00] house and going I'm gonna build my roof
[53:02] brother John well John says we're gonna
[53:05] build it on I don't know I'm just gonna
[53:08] build a roof you gotta have foundation
[53:13] you gotta have the walls then you can
[53:17] put the cap on it and then that look
[53:22] real silly just hanging up there in the
[53:23] air but now it's got purpose because you
[53:27] got a foundation and then you build then
[53:31] you put the top on it for the problem is
[53:34] we've been trying to build from the top
[53:36] down
[53:36] I think the Bible says in the Old
[53:40] Testament that zerubabbel was sweep the
[53:42] foundation off and build from that amen
[53:46] then alright so that's what we're doing
[53:49] we're not sure we're talking about our
[53:52] our board against experience but we're
[53:56] bringing it to a little higher level
[53:58] we're going up a little bit higher so
[54:00] that God can speak to us more because
[54:03] like I said before I was looking up in
[54:06] there minute ago where I put in Holy
[54:08] Spirit cannot put that in your search
[54:13] engine and see what you come up with
[54:16] brother Brian said the Holy Spirit
[54:18] cannot override your unbelief he was in
[54:22] a prayer line he said sister the Holy
[54:24] Ghost can't over a Holy Spirit can't
[54:25] override your unbelief Wow the Holy
[54:29] Ghost is the healing folks he was
[54:31] standing right there ready to heal that
[54:34] woman and because of her unbelief and
[54:36] guess what brother Brown says oh I see
[54:39] you're a Christian because remember the
[54:46] prophet of God said he said a prostitute
[54:48] will go across the platform and get her
[54:50] healing and a born-again Christian will
[54:52] miss it why cuz you've got all that
[54:54] going around in your head I can't I
[54:57] can't I ain't good enough faith the
[54:58] prostitute just lost the princess I
[55:00] believe what you say and God works on
[55:03] her belief and heals her but a Christian
[55:07] walks up and goes old man I spoke cross
[55:10] to my neighbor on him I didn't do
[55:12] something at work you lose number you
[55:15] lose your healing a good Christian
[55:18] person what to me now listen this is
[55:20] just me these cells to me blows the cap
[55:22] off all that because if we can see the
[55:25] real revelation that we're justified
[55:28] amen
[55:29] if you're born again those who he has
[55:31] justified he is already glorified hello
[55:39] glorified
[55:41] you're glorified body it's not hanging
[55:44] up in heaven somewhere you're glorified
[55:51] body it's sitting right there in your
[55:53] seat oh I don't know about that
[55:58] unbeliever why you gonna get a new one
[56:03] we're gonna throw this in a way and get
[56:04] another one no mo I don't think so
[56:07] there was an empty tomb one time and
[56:10] that's the only one that's ever been and
[56:13] he entered into a glorified condition
[56:16] he took his flesh body and entered into
[56:18] a glorified condition hey man no one
[56:21] else has done that before
[56:26] we're not even nothing close to what
[56:29] we're done then all right we okay don't
[56:33] blame sister Nikki for this all this
[56:34] background see that Isis is a sweet lady
[56:41] all right so the first thing we saw
[56:43] though was the mystery of iniquity
[56:44] because they asked brother Branham in
[56:46] Thessalonians they said brother Branham
[56:48] is opening the first seal or the first
[56:50] seal a part of the mystery of iniquity
[56:52] they go to second Thessalonians 2 verse
[56:54] 7 pull it up please for the mystery of
[56:57] iniquity doth already work now that's
[56:59] Paul in this age right here for the
[57:04] mystery of iniquity because I want you
[57:05] to think about this before we start
[57:08] reading in just a few minutes in
[57:09] revelations cuz see now that like
[57:14] brother Bob said now that we see the
[57:16] seals open we can go back and read those
[57:20] church ages from revelations 2 all the
[57:22] way through the Ephesians pergamus and
[57:25] Thyatira Smyrna and pergamus aids I'm
[57:27] sorry the first three ages read those
[57:29] three ages we're fixing to and we're
[57:32] going to show how that first seal just
[57:34] jumps right out at you for the mystery
[57:38] of iniquity doth already work only he's
[57:40] the prophet of God said God who now
[57:43] letteth will let in other words he's
[57:45] letting it happen until he the bride be
[57:50] taken out of the way now that's the
[57:51] quote out of the church age book I had
[57:54] it but
[57:54] I kind of condensed this all for today
[57:56] shall be taken out of the way so look
[57:58] like I said before the physical breaking
[58:02] of these seals are going to be after
[58:03] we're gone the man of sin sending temple
[58:06] of God showing us out to be ask God
[58:08] right amen
[58:09] all right and all these things but now
[58:11] you and I that's like people go real
[58:13] crazy you know when the brother Brown
[58:15] says the bride goes up in Revelations
[58:17] for one and not seen until revelations
[58:20] 19 they say well we don't even in there
[58:22] anywhere if you're not revelations 5
[58:24] you've got a problem hello
[58:29] you got a problem if you're not in
[58:31] revelation 5 that's the call of
[58:33] redemption and the call of the book
[58:35] which has got your name in it
[58:37] amen but we get the spiritual part of
[58:41] all that revelations for one a church
[58:43] sure goes up revelations 5 tells me how
[58:47] I went up Redemption my name was called
[58:52] I answered I went up and then revelation
[58:56] 6 is to break into these seals to you
[58:58] and I to change these bodies not to make
[59:02] us Christians
[59:05] there'll be millions of people in that
[59:08] new city that are Christians that are
[59:09] born-again
[59:11] Rosalie's kingdom of God people that
[59:15] never had these seals break in 1 2 3 4 5
[59:18] 6 7 only in this endtime did these seals
[59:23] break amen they didn't break they'd
[59:28] break - John John saw them I just read
[59:35] revelation 6:1
[59:36] and I saw when the lamb opened one of
[59:38] the seals who's talking to you John and
[59:40] I saw when the old one the seals I heard
[59:42] as it were the noise of thunder one of
[59:43] the four beasts saying come and see come
[59:46] here John I want to show you what's
[59:47] fixing to happen come here John I'm
[59:49] going to show you what's going to happen
[59:50] in a spiritual form but it's gonna have
[59:53] a natural happening y'all all right hey
[59:58] man what a matter o me thank you
[1:00:02] all right
[1:00:04] though the mystery of iniquity I just
[1:00:06] like I said before the mystery is now
[1:00:08] history we know where that iniquity that
[1:00:11] seat of Satan is if you're born again
[1:00:14] it's not in your soul nada not a speck
[1:00:20] of sin but now he can play in your body
[1:00:24] I'm not even in your body he can play in
[1:00:26] your spirit realm I ever tell you about
[1:00:27] memories and conscious fixing once or
[1:00:32] twice
[1:00:32] that's where Satan's playground is
[1:00:36] remember look your flesh doesn't sin you
[1:00:38] show it's sinful it come as a product of
[1:00:41] sin but this right here day if I don't
[1:00:44] make this hand do something that's not
[1:00:46] gonna do it
[1:00:47] you know what Satan can't even make this
[1:00:49] hand do anything but if he gets in plays
[1:00:52] in your spirit realm he can make you do
[1:00:54] a lot of things remember brother Brown
[1:00:55] said if you if Satan never comes into
[1:00:58] you remember you go out to him that's
[1:01:05] why he has no power to get in my soul
[1:01:08] anymore but through my memory reason
[1:01:10] conscious affection imagination he can
[1:01:12] play all day hey man my memory of what I
[1:01:18] used to do I can't forget but God said
[1:01:23] what sins are you dropped there my able
[1:01:25] to make a song about that what sins are
[1:01:29] you talking about that's what you bring
[1:01:30] them to God you say God forgive me of
[1:01:32] what I did 40 years ago thirty years ago
[1:01:34] twenty years ago ten minutes ago if you
[1:01:36] really did repent he'll say what sins
[1:01:39] you come see to me that's that
[1:01:42] justification that's bringing us up that
[1:01:43] pyramid not that we're so holy and
[1:01:47] righteous it's just that God did a work
[1:01:50] God didn't work and we got to depend on
[1:01:54] what he did if I depend on what he did
[1:01:59] follow his plan in his sixty-six book
[1:02:04] way of doing things
[1:02:07] prophet of God said I he said what he
[1:02:10] said God had a plan and a purpose
[1:02:13] and he was going to see it achieved how
[1:02:17] did he do that
[1:02:18] sixty-six books and a prophet and a
[1:02:23] bunch of eagles amen so the mystery of
[1:02:29] iniquity how's it going to be purged by
[1:02:31] mercy and truth iniquity is purged so
[1:02:35] there is a way out
[1:02:37] amen all iniquity oh you see iniquity
[1:02:42] and hundreds of times in the Bible but
[1:02:45] that one proverbs 16:6 by mercy and
[1:02:48] truth iniquity look it's purged now
[1:02:53] remember what I said before about purge
[1:02:54] that means something was in the line
[1:02:58] something was in the line it wasn't you
[1:03:02] were just so holy and righteous to begin
[1:03:03] with there was something in that line
[1:03:06] but by mercy and truth iniquity is
[1:03:08] purged and by the fear of the Lord men
[1:03:12] depart neither a man is that all right
[1:03:15] now justification we talked about
[1:03:17] justification they want to talk about
[1:03:19] this for just a minute
[1:03:20] go the next one please excuse me
[1:03:24] justification is a Hebrew word it means
[1:03:27] righteous as justified and vindicated by
[1:03:29] God the only way you can be justified is
[1:03:31] by God Amen so you take this white
[1:03:33] righteous church that's riding but
[1:03:36] you've got a real justified righteous
[1:03:39] church on the earth at the same time
[1:03:42] paul irene Paul Peter Paul James John
[1:03:46] all those ones they were righteous and
[1:03:49] justified listen listen
[1:03:51] so I said about the seals now you and I
[1:03:54] gonna have to come to a place to break
[1:03:55] this thing but all these people that are
[1:03:58] dead and went on there is justified as
[1:04:00] they'll ever be but they're waiting oh I
[1:04:05] love you that way no me and you they're
[1:04:08] waiting on somebody to go I'm justified
[1:04:10] why I'm alive
[1:04:13] hey man why God said so and I read an
[1:04:20] instruction manual you got that right
[1:04:31] isaiah 53:11 he shall see the travail of
[1:04:36] his soul that he shall be satisfied by
[1:04:38] his knowledge shall my righteous servant
[1:04:40] justify many when he went to the cross
[1:04:46] he justified everybody he's ever gone
[1:04:50] justified he did it at Calvary amen
[1:04:54] oh think about a cleansing we need him
[1:04:57] got to sanctification yet this is happy
[1:04:59] enough being justified
[1:05:01] amen because we're getting into the
[1:05:05] second sailor that now we got a
[1:05:06] sanctification which pushes all out my
[1:05:09] righteous servant justify many for he
[1:05:11] shall what bared their iniquity amen he
[1:05:15] bore our iniquity Romans 3 verse 24
[1:05:19] being justified freely by His grace
[1:05:22] through redemption there's that word
[1:05:26] through the redemption that is in Christ
[1:05:29] Jesus whom hath sent forth to be a
[1:05:32] perpetuation through faith in his blood
[1:05:34] to declare his righteousness for the
[1:05:39] remission of sins that are past through
[1:05:42] the forbearance of God so brother
[1:05:44] Branham is not the first person to come
[1:05:45] up with justification just chopped off
[1:05:48] you pay sins the Bible tells that amen I
[1:05:51] think that may be where the prophet got
[1:05:54] yeah I do too Romans 8 verse 29 for whom
[1:06:01] he does 400 dead for knew we love this
[1:06:03] one I do for who he did for knew
[1:06:06] foreknowledge first didn't
[1:06:07] predestination for whom he did foreknow
[1:06:10] he also did predestinate so by
[1:06:14] foreknowledge he could predestinate
[1:06:15] absolutely there's no way you could have
[1:06:17] come but this way right
[1:06:19] alright but we didn't know that
[1:06:23] we didn't know that he did he did we
[1:06:29] didn't - where Redemption comes in
[1:06:32] that's why we're going to sing the
[1:06:35] redemption story that's why the angels
[1:06:37] cannot sing that song they never lost
[1:06:40] anything fool me did foreknow he also
[1:06:43] did predestinate what to be conformed to
[1:06:45] the image of his son that he might be
[1:06:47] the firstborn among many brethren look
[1:06:49] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[1:06:52] he called and whom he called them he
[1:06:56] also justified and whom he justified
[1:06:59] them he also glorified hey man so if
[1:07:03] you're truly justified today you're
[1:07:06] heading to glorification no way to lose
[1:07:12] it no way to lose it now you might have
[1:07:18] to go by the grave and you might have to
[1:07:20] go down and go over that six dimension
[1:07:23] for a little while but you know what as
[1:07:26] long as I'm alive there's one scripture
[1:07:28] that says we which are alive and remain
[1:07:31] I am going to say today I am a one of
[1:07:37] the I am a week because remember we
[1:07:40] talked about Apostle Paul Paul said they
[1:07:42] without us cannot be made perfect with
[1:07:44] Paul died he became a day and we became
[1:07:49] a nice Paul was looking back at the Old
[1:07:52] Testament he said they without less can
[1:07:54] be made perfect Paul became of a we're
[1:07:56] over here in the end time going thing
[1:07:58] without us cannot be made perfect I'm
[1:08:02] just telling you what God says it's not
[1:08:03] something I said that's what God said
[1:08:05] about a man I'm just quoting you I'm
[1:08:07] just quoting you want the instruction
[1:08:08] manual told amen
[1:08:14] alright let's read number two real quick
[1:08:17] visible Union we've read these before
[1:08:19] but you know what repetition you're
[1:08:23] standing completely you never sinned at
[1:08:26] the first place God don't even know it's
[1:08:31] in the sea of forgetfulness you never
[1:08:34] did it
[1:08:35] you were accused of it by the accuser
[1:08:37] but really from the beginning you were
[1:08:40] predestinated a man to be a son and
[1:08:45] daughter of God you're standing there
[1:08:47] washed and your old book of divorcement
[1:08:50] so you did have an old book you did have
[1:08:54] an old book but like I said before when
[1:08:57] Satan walks up he goes you see this gun
[1:09:00] you see this he goes I don't see nothing
[1:09:05] what sin is you talking about saying
[1:09:08] says can't you read daddy said can't see
[1:09:10] a thing
[1:09:11] read the red it's white
[1:09:15] a man absolutely out of existence even
[1:09:22] in the mind of God our problem is is we
[1:09:29] don't have the mind of God in our memory
[1:09:33] reason conscience affection imagination
[1:09:35] but I'll promise you that inside man
[1:09:37] that one in your soul he's saying that
[1:09:40] right there he's saying that today hey
[1:09:44] man how could he denies word he can't
[1:09:48] denies words those who he's justified
[1:09:51] he's already glorified that's finished
[1:09:53] in his mind as I Carney said three
[1:10:01] turtle people who came down here to have
[1:10:02] a human experience hey man so that's
[1:10:05] where we're dead listen redemptions
[1:10:07] didn't happen in heaven weird em should
[1:10:10] happen on the earth amen we will never
[1:10:16] get nothing
[1:10:17] all right you're right same in all right
[1:10:23] tell you what we're gonna do let's go to
[1:10:30] the next one which says one God because
[1:10:33] remember to me the true revelation of
[1:10:36] the first seal is is the Lord your one
[1:10:40] Lord first seal first commandment
[1:10:47] thou shall have no other gods before me
[1:10:51] I was telling brother Lewis or brother
[1:10:52] Bob listen when you get a true
[1:10:55] revelation to one God see the
[1:10:58] Trinitarian doctrine has to go away
[1:11:00] that's what road when you get a true
[1:11:04] revelation one god you'll never baptized
[1:11:06] in the name of father son holy go when
[1:11:08] you get a true revelation one god
[1:11:10] there's not two lords when you get three
[1:11:12] revelation to one god there's no eternal
[1:11:14] hell you see all the doctrines that
[1:11:17] brother Branham sure he preached them
[1:11:19] but he said thank God for the opening of
[1:11:21] these seals you know what happened I'm
[1:11:24] just going to stop right here and we'll
[1:11:25] finish well don't do it next week listen
[1:11:28] a thunder have you ever been outside on
[1:11:37] a summer evening hey you ever been
[1:11:41] outside on a Sunday evening or something
[1:11:44] evening you sit out there and you hear
[1:11:47] this boom boom boom boom that's thunder
[1:11:51] right but somewhere oh I hope you get
[1:11:56] there somewhere a light came from
[1:12:00] nowhere
[1:12:01] hit the earth and said I'm here I'm here
[1:12:07] I am the light there had to be lightning
[1:12:13] before there was a thunder and then so
[1:12:17] what are the thunders it's the voice of
[1:12:19] God something coming from eternity to
[1:12:25] the present and saying I'm here and on
[1:12:29] that day when I feel broke the Prophet
[1:12:31] was telling us God is here
[1:12:35] and he said finally I've got somebody on
[1:12:38] the earth they don't believe what I said
[1:12:41] [Applause]
[1:12:42] there'll be no more denominations
[1:12:45] there'll be no more false doctrine boom
[1:12:56] there's your voice' garden cuz it's been
[1:13:01] bound listen they don't have this I'm
[1:13:04] just going to read and then we'll close
[1:13:05] we'll finish next Sunday Feast of the
[1:13:08] trumpets notice while that group is a
[1:13:10] riding riding making themself ready to
[1:13:14] stomp out everything that won't agree
[1:13:16] with them there is another group I'm
[1:13:21] going to shape there's another group
[1:13:23] being made ready
[1:13:25] after a wild revelations 19 the next
[1:13:28] time the church is heard she comes also
[1:13:30] not upon his ankle of horses but the
[1:13:32] Bible says he was on a white horse the
[1:13:34] hosts of heaven would follow him upon
[1:13:36] white horses that's right while this
[1:13:38] group down here has got 2,000 bound at
[1:13:40] the river euphrates and has been bound
[1:13:43] for 2,000 years now what's he talking
[1:13:45] about from here to here it's 2,000 years
[1:13:48] all right and that's been bound for
[1:13:51] 2,000 years
[1:13:53] also that church has bound the Holy
[1:13:55] Ghost
[1:13:57] the church has bound the Holy Ghost for
[1:14:01] nearly 2,000 years here we go under
[1:14:05] martyrdom back there and under the
[1:14:06] church ages it's been bound not at the
[1:14:09] river euphrates but at the door of
[1:14:11] creeds and dogmas they mad that the Holy
[1:14:15] Spirit can't work in the church because
[1:14:19] the man-made system but she's going to
[1:14:21] be liberated there's your lightning
[1:14:24] there's your thunder the prophet of God
[1:14:28] it's pronouncing that it's done she's
[1:14:35] now liberated that seals broken that
[1:14:38] horse rider is gone he's riding away
[1:14:42] she's coming back that's what the Bible
[1:14:45] said in those to meet one another on the
[1:14:47] battleground list for Michael
[1:14:48] like in the beginning they've been bound
[1:14:50] for 2,000 years almost 2,000 years let's
[1:14:56] listen rib one more future home 1964 he
[1:15:01] gave Peter the keys to the kingdom
[1:15:03] and what was bound at Pentecost is
[1:15:06] balance forever oh but listen that's the
[1:15:11] reason the bride come in to reap review
[1:15:14] the second time there has to be a church
[1:15:18] called out of the latter-day listen

[1:15:41] shoulder going I wish to shut up
[1:15:44] I got a quote that brother Brown said
[1:15:47] went like that please people face final
[1:15:52] resting places in the Word of God if you
[1:15:54] can't put a quote in the Word of God you
