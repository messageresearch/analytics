[21:22] 55 and when all the land of Egypt was
[21:25] famished the people cried to Pharaoh for
[21:29] bread and Pharaoh said unto all the
[21:32] Egyptians go unto Joseph what he say to
[21:37] you do that's a
[21:40] position and the famine was over all the
[21:43] face of the Earth and Joseph opened the
[21:47] storehouses and sold unto the Egyptians
[21:51] and the famine walks sore in the land of
[21:54] Egypt and all countries came unto Egypt
[21:58] to Joseph for to buy corn because that
[22:01] the famine was so sore in the land and
[22:05] we move to 4 42 now when Jacob saw that
[22:11] there was corn in Egypt Jacob said unto
[22:14] his son why do you look one upon
[22:18] another and he said behold I've heard
[22:22] that there is corn in Egypt get you down
[22:25] thither and and buy for us from hence
[22:29] that we may live and not die and Joseph
[22:32] 10 Brethren went down to buy corn in
[22:35] Egypt but Benjamin Joseph BR Joseph's
[22:39] brother Jacob sent not with his brethren
[22:42] for he said L per Adventure Mischief
[22:46] befall him and the sons of Israel came
[22:48] to buy corn among those that
[22:51] came for the famine was in the land of
[22:55] Canaan right and Joseph was a governor
[22:58] over the land and and he was that uh and
[23:04] and it was that sold to all the people
[23:07] of the land and Joseph Brethren came and
[23:10] bowed on themselves before him with
[23:13] their faces to the hurt may the Lord add
[23:16] his Blessing to the reading of the word
[23:18] you may be seated so you you know it
[23:21] started that Joseph had received this
[23:25] quot and and by that
[23:28] he he was given this gift of dreams and
[23:33] the interpretation of dreams and and so
[23:36] he had these dream that he begin to tell
[23:39] his Brethren what he dreamed never even
[23:41] might be looking at it right that that I
[23:44] see you know the and and and and they
[23:46] begin to interpret you know we're going
[23:48] to bow down before you and they're
[23:51] saying to Joseph you know these things
[23:53] can't be we we can't see that much in
[23:55] you that we're going to Bow ourselves
[23:58] down before you and and you know it make
[24:00] them angry with him because it it seems
[24:04] like he was taking too much upon himself
[24:07] you've heard those words before but he
[24:10] couldn't help it because he had the
[24:12] dream and he was really telling them
[24:14] what God had showed to
[24:16] him and so that that angered them really
[24:20] but it's not Joseph it's God right amen
[24:24] and if God has selected you it's not you
[24:26] it's God right
[24:28] and you can only say that which God has
[24:30] put in your mouth to say you you can
[24:33] only speak of that which God has done in
[24:36] your midst really right and and and so
[24:39] they you know though they did not like
[24:41] it but it's not his doing it's God's
[24:43] doing we we see also that in 41 we see
[24:47] that Joseph now taking a
[24:51] wife and when he took that wife he had
[24:53] two sons and you know it's interesting
[24:56] in scripture the way things go it's not
[24:58] like you know the way we do things just
[25:01] aply but God has a purpose for
[25:04] everything right you know Joseph when he
[25:06] had the first son he called his name
[25:09] manesa and and and that says for God
[25:13] said he has made me forget my toil of
[25:17] all my father's house he had to forget
[25:21] those things that were behind him right
[25:23] hello because if you carry the baggage
[25:26] of yesterday you can't move forward in
[25:29] God Amen you've got to leave some things
[25:32] behind you and then then the the the
[25:35] birth of the second was Ephraim and then
[25:38] in Ephraim for God has caused me to be
[25:41] fruitful in the land of my Affliction so
[25:45] so where they they brought him down to
[25:47] Egypt for affliction that becomes a
[25:50] blessing right for God will make your
[25:53] trials becomes your blessing is that
[25:57] right amen you you've got to take it the
[25:59] right way if if we started cry and said
[26:01] God why me why God why why me God why
[26:04] you have to do if you start to get angry
[26:06] with God but listen when you when you
[26:08] accept that which God has done then God
[26:11] can make that that that that trial a
[26:13] blessing is that right hallelujah amen
[26:18] so he walked from it and and then as he
[26:20] walked from it God bless him Hallelujah
[26:23] then we find out the famine down there
[26:25] in Egypt it was Progressive
[26:28] the the the seven years the the the the
[26:31] the years of plenty all the Earth had
[26:34] seen all of this then slowly the famine
[26:37] begin to you know take the land and you
[26:40] know it seemed like it started the far
[26:42] away land because it went down and the
[26:44] Bible says and then the famine was in
[26:47] Egypt so it it it was you you heard it
[26:50] way off and then before you know it it
[26:53] was right there where you are we heard
[26:56] these things I remember the the years
[26:58] when it it was Brazil's economy and and
[27:01] they didn't know what to do and then it
[27:03] was Argentina you know under the IMF and
[27:06] and they couldn't just manage themselves
[27:09] but then you you you see a kind of
[27:12] famine in in economic recession and was
[27:15] moving over the
[27:17] Earth we've seen that you know since uh
[27:21] uh
[27:23] 911 it it seems like that would have
[27:25] started a Great Famine but what it did
[27:29] it boost the the the the world's economy
[27:32] for a while and since 2001 to 07 we've
[27:37] seen you know um people buying houses
[27:40] the economy booming people's business
[27:43] begin to move it's a great time for
[27:47] everybody amen and that's on the natural
[27:50] but in the spiritual God was was showing
[27:53] us things and and saying to Us store of
[27:56] the food right is it right it is time
[27:59] for you to know your possession it is
[28:03] time to you to get start settled in the
[28:05] word of God because I'm going to do
[28:07] something new yeah hello and we can see
[28:12] we can watch this progression in the
[28:14] word of God by
[28:15] Revelation a mean little things that we
[28:18] had there in the word that mightbe we
[28:20] have glanced and we glean over them then
[28:22] we start to take these things and and
[28:24] put them in their right
[28:26] perspective hello
[28:28] and we realize that God was really doing
[28:31] something Among Us amen hallelujah so
[28:35] there it Isen Genesis is typing our time
[28:40] Pharaoh's dream was really God saying
[28:43] something to them but it was all in
[28:46] symbols Hallelujah and you find that it
[28:49] took a man Hallelujah that was anointed
[28:52] by God am me to take that dream and and
[28:56] to put it now in perspective and we've
[28:59] got to be careful of these things
[29:00] sometimes because you know people come
[29:02] and said well well you know I've got a
[29:04] dream and I've got this and I've got
[29:05] that Hey listen amen it's not every
[29:08] dream for the
[29:09] church hello amen I got to say that it's
[29:13] not every dream means something right am
[29:16] me I've got dreams and and it didn't
[29:18] mean anything right I
[29:20] remember when the girls were here you
[29:22] know we we certainly thank you back
[29:24] there for the gift that you have sent to
[29:26] us amen we a k h a mixer board and and

[31:01] equipment was older and so they didn't
[31:04] they didn't look at the equipment they
[31:05] look at the box and and they were start
[31:07] charging us the duty on the box because
[31:09] it was a you know they went on the net
[31:10] and they and so you know so he said it
[31:12] was $35,000 said well check you know

[43:28] it's not what you ask for God knows

[43:52] God will provide it what a confidence
[43:55] you have in God
[43:57] hallelujah
[43:58] hallelujah amen so the same man that was

[44:03] prison yes sir it's now the man with the
[44:06] spirit of God inside of him right that's
[44:09] what Pharaoh say hallelujah man who has
[44:12] gone through a time of suffering a

[44:38] disturbance yes in the midst of the
[44:42] famine Joseph is remembering now amen
[44:46] what he had preached on years

[45:00] are you there with me amen because they

[45:13] years they had lost amen Association
[45:16] because of what he had preached amen but
[45:19] now it's coming into
[45:22] manifestation and me he did not know
[45:24] what the famine all of the would bring
[45:27] but now that the famine is here the same
[45:30] word that he was ridiculed for that
[45:32] brought the spiritual disturbance me now
[45:35] that same word causing his Brethren Amen
[45:39] to come before him when they come before
[45:42] the Bible says and Joseph was governor
[45:45] over in Egypt and you can't face the
[45:47] governor without your bow down before
[45:49] him exactly that's right amen right
[45:54] Hallelujah way God works
[45:57] things just in
[46:00] Simplicity you you don't get excited
[46:02] about it no you you don't have to do
[46:04] anything just believe God's word amen
[46:08] and take confidence in God's word
[46:12] hallelujah amen you know sometimes I
[46:15] find people you know they might be sick
[46:17] and and they keep talking about you know
[46:20] I'm I'm Healed God heal me and many
[46:22] times they saying that so much because
[46:24] they're in fear yeah that's right and so
[46:27] they're trying to works up to let them
[46:29] believe themselves but you don't have to
[46:32] do that just take the promise of God
[46:35] right hallelujah amen amen you know God
[46:39] can move you past
[46:42] anything anything God can let you move
[46:44] past you know I remember just a few
[46:47] weeks ago in church you know I was on a
[46:49] certain subject and you know Sister you
[46:51] know she said you know 3 years ago or so
[46:55] she went to the doctor and and she was
[46:58] diagnosed with W with sugar
[47:00] diabetes and she said you know Lord you
[47:03] know I didn't ask for this and Lord you
[47:06] know I don't I don't want it and you
[47:08] know so they put her on a strict diet
[47:10] and and medication and so and she said
[47:12] one good thing she couldn't afford none
[47:14] of that so she said she put it all in
[47:17] the hands of God and and she went and
[47:19] she believed that well you know if God
[47:21] don't do something I'm going to die
[47:22] because I ain't going to take none of
[47:23] this really because I have no way of
[47:26] taking it and so you know she she went
[47:29] back to the doctor years after and she
[47:31] went back to her same doctor the doctor
[47:33] said Hey listen she pull her file and
[47:35] she said oh yeah so you're you're on
[47:37] your medication no you're on your dot no
[47:41] and so the doctor says you know you're
[47:44] walking in serious business now this is
[47:47] serious you you know you ought not to do
[47:50] this to yourself so the doctor you know
[47:52] start all over again and let her do all
[47:55] the test and everything really am me to
[47:57] see how father that she's gone and he
[47:59] said when she brought back the test she
[48:01] said the doctor jumping up and Sh and
[48:03] praising the Lord because said I don't
[48:04] know what happened but you don't have it
[48:06] no more
[48:08] amen if you will believe God you will
[48:11] walk away from it amen and you don't
[48:14] have to tell nobody because people are
[48:17] walking around and telling everybody so
[48:19] they little more leap sugar diabetes
[48:21] becomes a great mountain and they can't
[48:23] cross over it amen that's right you know
[48:26] everybody that knows about it give you
[48:28] their
[48:29] opinion and everybody that knows about
[48:31] give you a remedy that you you can work
[48:33] with hello and everybody and nobody's
[48:36] telling you Hey listen just walk away
[48:38] from it
[48:41] am it
[48:43] amen so we move now to chapter
[48:50] 43 and the famine was sore in the land
[48:54] now I want to show you that uh what the
[48:56] Bible begin to tell us is that the the
[48:59] famine start from one area and it begins
[49:01] to spread and you know there's something
[49:04] about famine really means
[49:06] scarcity and in the scarcity when when
[49:09] food scarce then the price go up a and
[49:13] so the privileged can reach it and those
[49:15] that are not so privileged can't reach
[49:17] it but but in Egypt the the store houses
[49:21] were filled so everybody had to go into
[49:25] to Egypt they had to go to the city they
[49:28] had to go to the system they had to take
[49:31] the Mark is that right Hallelujah and if
[49:36] you read those scripture you see also
[49:38] that Joseph had had engineer it a
[49:41] certain way that the people when they
[49:45] gave when they came to Egypt and their
[49:47] money was out the Bible says and the
[49:50] money fa isn't that what he said the
[49:53] money fa they didn't have no more money
[49:55] because they were paying more money for
[49:58] the little that they need until all
[50:00] their money was spent then Joseph tell
[50:03] them bringing your possession give all
[50:06] your possession to Egypt right hello and
[50:09] they gave their houses their land their
[50:12] C they give everything to Egypt and
[50:15] brother way when all that was finished
[50:17] Joseph tell them give yourself to
[50:20] Egypt sell yourself now to the system so
[50:24] they were belonging to the system and
[50:27] there was nothing they could do about it
[50:30] and the Bible tells us about the mark of
[50:32] the beast right and every man whose name
[50:37] is not written in the Lamb's Book of
[50:39] Life shall take the Mark is that right
[50:43] right so I I can show you that only
[50:46] those of Joseph family right weren't
[50:49] sold out to the system but Joseph LED
[50:52] them do it
[50:54] right it's a sign of the time right and
[50:58] you said brother how will that be it's
[51:00] going to be that everything they horn is
[51:02] going to be horned by the bank and the
[51:05] bank belong to the system and so the
[51:08] system hold them that they can't do
[51:10] anything without somebody dictate to
[51:13] them and tell them what they ought to do
[51:16] right I I've seen our country go back to
[51:18] the IMF because we just can't manage
[51:21] ourselves it means that the politicians
[51:24] are fail yeah and so when you when you
[51:27] go to the IMF that's the international
[51:28] monetary system what they do is that
[51:31] they they said well the the policies
[51:33] that you have of all feel so we're going
[51:36] to set you on a part to recovery or to
[51:39] self-management and so they begin to
[51:42] tell you exactly what you ought to do
[51:44] right and so they free freeze wages
[51:47] right and you ain't going to get no wage
[51:50] the wage increase no matter what you do
[51:53] because the government who might be
[51:55] paternalistic they can't do it because
[51:58] they become slave to a system and they
[52:02] can't break the rules of the system or
[52:04] else they'll hold back the green back we
[52:06] call it and they can't pay for goods and
[52:09] service so they belong to the system and
[52:12] there's no way out of
[52:14] it and so when when wages are not
[52:17] raising and and people can't reach out
[52:19] to other so they go to the system and
[52:21] begin to borrow from the system and when
[52:24] they borrow from the system the system
[52:27] has take their equity and their Equity
[52:29] is tied into the system and they can't
[52:32] get out of
[52:33] it and that's why many business people
[52:37] overnight they kill themselves right
[52:40] they don't know what to do they can't
[52:42] manage they realize they've just lost
[52:45] control but Brethren I tell you you
[52:48] don't worry about the system me we've
[52:50] got a God there is a Joseph in Egypt the
[52:55] spirit of the Lord is on and he's got
[52:58] the word of
[53:00] God amen
[53:02] hallelujah
[53:04] amen
[53:05] glory so you know oh I look at it like
[53:09] this you know so we we we find
[53:13] that since
[53:15] 01
[53:17] 207 we had great
[53:19] increase people were Hing houses not

[1:07:25] of the things that we do amen but but
[1:07:28] the church and the word of God becomes a
[1:07:30] central theme of Our
[1:07:33] Lives I show them that in the in the
[1:07:37] wilderness the Tabernacle that they
[1:07:40] placed there in the middle of them it
[1:07:42] wasn't just a symbol of all the symbols
[1:07:45] around them no the place where they
[1:07:48] place to Hallelujah to the cardinal
[1:07:51] direction of the Tabernacle it was just
[1:07:53] something somewhere that they go because
[1:07:55] they wanted to go the Tabernacle was a
[1:07:58] central theme of their lives and the
[1:08:01] word of God has got to become the
[1:08:03] central theme of our lives uh amen
[1:08:06] whatever we do in business whatever work
[1:08:07] we do whatever we do for pleasure the

[1:09:01] the word of God and parents the way you
[1:09:05] respond to your children is because of
[1:09:08] the word of
[1:09:10] God exactly right that is what keep the
[1:09:13] family unit because that is secondary to
[1:09:18] the family of almighty God because God
[1:09:21] give us this promise that all that you
[1:09:22] love and all that love you is going to
[1:09:25] be there oh you can't take us away from
[1:09:27] that promise Hallelujah exactly and we

[1:10:19] tied up in the love of God and he can't
[1:10:22] take away that which you love that's
