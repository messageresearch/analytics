[1:05] Sunday school a study this morning give
[1:07] us understanding of it Lord as we uh
[1:10] study about your word in Jesus name amen
[1:13] God bless you can be Satan
[1:21] y'all bear with me just a minute I
[1:23] forgot my notes I have paper notes
[2:00] got too many things to remember
[2:02] so this morning we're going to do a
[2:04] little study about faith because uh it's
[2:07] right in line with what everybody's
[2:09] talking about brother Wade ministering
[2:10] to us about adoption about the Statue of
[2:12] perfect man being you know Faith being
[2:14] the foundation of that
[2:16] and then brother Aaron talking about on
[2:19] that lesson that we know well we know
[2:21] that only comes from Faith you know from
[2:23] a certainty
[2:25] um he's been preaching a really good
[2:27] little series about that and then now
[2:28] brother Bob getting into Hebrews 11 also
[2:30] about faith I don't know exactly what
[2:32] all directions he'll go but you know I
[2:34] just want to keep us meditating on that
[2:36] same thought
[2:37] um
[2:39] right now we're not connecting here
[2:47] so maybe they'll get that going here in
[2:49] a minute
[2:50] a PowerPoint
[2:53] and uh brother Bob was talking about how
[2:55] that Faith uh the whole whole reason
[2:58] that God's word has such strength and
[3:00] such power is because the Integrity of
[3:03] the man Jesus Christ himself because he
[3:05] is truth he is nothing but truth he
[3:07] cannot fail he's all truth I mean to say
[3:09] he cannot fail his work cannot fail so
[3:12] he has this Integrity this character
[3:14] that's steadfast that's sure and that's
[3:16] why his his word has such power and then
[3:19] if you think about it on the opposite
[3:21] side of that the devil the reason his
[3:22] word has no power is because you know he
[3:25] has no Integrity no character he's you
[3:28] know his word uh Satan's word will fail
[3:30] he's nothing but lies in the father of
[3:32] Lies so that's why we don't believe
[3:34] Satan
[3:35] so we're going to talk about faith I
[3:37] want to just basically give you an
[3:38] overview broad overview in a short time
[3:40] span and uh what is Faith and how much
[3:44] power it is at its fullest form the
[3:48] faith of Jesus Christ himself I just
[3:49] want to give one illustration about that
[3:51] and then
[3:53] talk about how do you get this Faith
[3:54] because he made it available to all of
[3:56] us so what is Faith this is not an
[3:58] exhaustive list this is just a few
[4:00] things that came to my mind when I was
[4:01] making this lesson it's not all that
[4:03] faith is but these are some of the
[4:04] things faith is revelation
[4:07] belief in God when I was a Baptist
[4:09] that's all I knew Faith was as well I
[4:11] believe in God that's Faith but that's
[4:12] the beginning of it but there's more of
[4:14] it that it's a reality it's a positive
[4:17] sense a super sense a long-range vision
[4:20] substance it's the most powerful force
[4:23] uh it's a journey that you're going on
[4:25] and it's a place and that sounds kind of
[4:28] odd so I'm going to talk about that
[4:30] especially in this lesson about faith as
[4:33] being a place or a position
[4:36] uh some definitions here about faith
[4:39] relating to Christ as a strong and
[4:41] welcome conviction or belief that Jesus
[4:43] is the messiah through whom we obtain
[4:45] Eternal salvation in the kingdom of God
[4:47] the religious beliefs of Christians
[4:49] belief with the predominant idea of
[4:50] trust or confidence whether in God or in
[4:54] Christ
[4:55] springing from faith in the same
[4:57] fidelity
[4:58] faithfulness the character of one who
[5:01] can be relied on that's what brother Bob
[5:02] was talking about the other day
[5:04] last time we taught Sunday school
[5:05] talking about that we can rely on God
[5:07] more than anything
[5:09] Hebrews 11 definition now Faith is a
[5:11] substitute of things hoped for the
[5:12] evidence of Things Not Seen for by the
[5:14] elders obtain a good report
[5:16] it doesn't say faith is just the
[5:19] substance you got to be careful not to
[5:20] think that well that's all faith is just
[5:22] the substance hope for now like I said
[5:24] faith is a lot of things it's a really
[5:26] broad subject
[5:27] it's a really broad thing and it covers
[5:29] a lot of ground
[5:30] but faith is among other things it is a
[5:32] substance that's for sure
[5:34] through faith we understand that the
[5:35] world's refrained by the word of God so
[5:37] the things which are made or not things
[5:39] which are seen are not made
[5:42] we're not made of things to appear
[5:49] the stature perfect man brother said
[5:51] notice you must be born again and when
[5:52] you're born again you can't be born
[5:54] again without having faith that's right
[5:55] so you see in my chart here I got the
[5:57] very Foundation faith is a foundation of
[5:59] all of it for without faith it's
[6:01] impossible to please God in the coming
[6:03] to God must believe that he is and a
[6:04] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[6:05] him he must be and when you're a skeptic
[6:08] of the Bible when you're skeptic of the
[6:10] word being right you just might as well
[6:12] stay back until first you believe it so
[6:13] that's the beginning of Faith keep that
[6:15] in mind believe in God and that's a
[6:17] choice nobody makes you believe you
[6:20] decide in yourself I'm going to believe
[6:21] in Jesus Christ
[6:22] what is sin unbelief there's only two
[6:24] elements that controls a human being
[6:26] that's either doubt or faith one of the
[6:28] other possessive one that dominates your
[6:31] life
[6:34] hahaha
[6:36] and just depends on how much Faith you
[6:38] have how high you can rise but first
[6:39] it's got to be Faith let me stand that
[6:41] foundation for a while Faith Is What You
[6:43] Must Believe faith is a substance of
[6:44] things hoped for it's you already have
[6:46] it when you have faith because it's a
[6:49] revealed in faith faithful seven
[6:51] substance things hoped for the evidence
[6:52] of what is it what kind of evidence a
[6:55] holy evidence
[7:01] and then why Christ speak brother
[7:03] Brandon said for you see Faith sees what
[7:06] God wants done so it has something to do
[7:08] with the will of God the word of God
[7:10] faith doesn't look at the present time
[7:12] Faith doesn't see this here Faith looks
[7:14] to what to see what God wants done and
[7:17] it works accordingly that's what faith
[7:18] does it sees what God wants and what God
[7:21] wants done and Faith operates through
[7:23] that faith is a long-range Vision it
[7:26] don't lower its sights it holds to the
[7:28] Target
[7:30] there's a lot in here let me get to
[7:32] about Divine Healing hopefully I got
[7:34] time for all that
[7:36] answers on a question answered on
[7:37] Genesis now back there them this is my
[7:40] example of my illustration of God's
[7:42] faith God spoke his word in creation and
[7:47] he believed his word so he makes his
[7:49] word with his faith and you're talking
[7:51] about a lot of power
[7:53] um
[7:54] back there then when this little Halo
[7:57] comes now we can't see nothing yet this
[8:00] is Brother bam I'm talking about
[8:00] creation
[8:02] but just by ours of Supernatural we see
[8:05] a Halo standing there now that's the Son
[8:07] of God the logos
[8:12] now I can see him playing around like a
[8:14] little child before the father's door
[8:15] with all eternity before him
[8:17] and now then in his imaginary makeup it
[8:19] began to think of what things would be
[8:22] and I can hear him say let there be
[8:24] light and when he did and Adam bursted
[8:26] and the sun came into existence she
[8:27] Whirled for hundreds of million years
[8:29] forming clinkers and burning and forming
[8:30] like it is today still burning still
[8:33] breaking atoms if the top bomb would
[8:34] ever get loose the atomic chain would
[8:36] take the surface be like the sun Yonder
[8:38] just bursting and blowing
[8:40] if you could stand over on another
[8:42] continent I guess you could say he's
[8:44] probably meaning like another planet or
[8:46] whatever and look at this it would look
[8:48] like another Sun where the atoms was
[8:50] bursting and burning this Earth if this
[8:52] chain would ever get loose and it just
[8:54] started turning rolling like that
[8:55] millions and millions of miles in each
[8:56] of these big Flames billions of
[8:58] Fahrenheit of the heat that goes off of
[9:00] that sun
[9:02] Luke 137 is one quote of scriptures here
[9:05] with God nothing shall be impossible if
[9:08] thou can'tst believe all things are
[9:09] possible in The Believer keep this in
[9:11] mind as we're talking about this great
[9:12] powerful faith that I'm illustrating
[9:14] here watch this now beautiful how he's
[9:16] made the Sun and then the first thing
[9:18] you know a big clinker fell off and
[9:19] weighed about just like the Earth here
[9:22] which then this logos here now the Son
[9:26] of God is watching it here he lets it
[9:27] fall for 100 million years and he stops
[9:29] IT and another one flies off of me lets
[9:31] it flow off fall for mans of years then
[9:33] he stops it now we're standing watching
[9:35] it come into existence now he's got
[9:37] something in his mind and what's he
[9:39] doing he's writing his first Bible
[9:44] I'm gonna give y'all some little things
[9:46] here I'd like to look these up every now
[9:47] and then this is interesting it shows
[9:48] you how much God is in control and how
[9:50] powerful he is
[9:51] the Earth rotates at a thousand miles an
[9:54] hour anybody feel like you're moving a
[9:55] thousand miles an hour right now or if
[9:57] rotates a thousand miles an hour Earth
[9:59] orbits around the Sun at 67 000 miles an
[10:02] hour
[10:04] I think we we feel pretty safe and
[10:05] secure though sounds like God's in
[10:07] control Sun orbits the Galaxy
[10:10] our sun and its solar system orbits the
[10:13] whole galaxy of the Milky Way at 500 000
[10:17] miles an hour half a million
[10:20] half million miles an hour
[10:22] the Galaxy is a hundred thousand light
[10:24] years across this is a big place not the
[10:27] universe I'm talking about our Milky Way
[10:28] galaxy the estimate to be a hundred
[10:30] thousand light years so if you can go
[10:32] the speed of light 186 000 miles per
[10:35] second
[10:36] for a hundred thousand years it would
[10:37] take you that's what it would take you
[10:38] to cross this whole galaxy and that's
[10:40] just one Galaxy in this whole universe
[10:44] that this guy made this guy Jesus Christ
[10:46] with this great faith that he mixed his
[10:48] word with his faith and made this big of
[10:50] a place just this one Galaxy out of many
[10:54] there's a hundred billion stars in the
[10:56] Milky Way galaxy and each one of them
[10:58] has its own planet or planets orbiting
[11:00] it
[11:01] about 170 billion galaxies in the known
[11:04] universe they don't know the end of it
[11:06] yet they can't find an end of it last I
[11:08] heard
[11:09] but it's a big place
[11:12] then
[11:13] estimated 200 billion trillion Stars so
[11:18] take
[11:19] a trillion
[11:21] 200 billion of those and that's about
[11:23] how many stars in the known universe
[11:25] just what they know of what they can
[11:26] estimate
[11:27] it's a big place a super sense
[11:30] it's the most powerful force to ever hit
[11:32] the earth it's that sense called The
[11:33] Sixth Sense has nothing to do with this
[11:35] down here if this down here ever
[11:36] declares it and this it says Amen to it
[11:39] talking about you know aren't us in our
[11:40] natural senses you know to uh you're
[11:42] moving on but regardless of what this
[11:44] does and you know RC tasteful smell here
[11:46] believe that there's where the power if
[11:48] you believe in your heart your fifth
[11:50] sense of thinking lays within your brain
[11:51] but your Sixth Sense lays in your heart
[11:53] you believe with your heart confession
[11:56] is made by the mouth
[11:57] you believe with your heart yes sir that
[12:01] sixth sense that powerful force on just
[12:04] Limitless power we're talking about here
[12:06] the faith of Jesus Christ and he's
[12:08] trying to give us he gave us each a
[12:10] piece of that we each have that by
[12:12] measure faces of substance uh faith is
[12:14] only direct and positive sense and it's
[12:16] in Sixth Sense faith is more than sight
[12:18] it's more than feeling you do not feel
[12:20] Faith you don't taste Faith you don't
[12:21] smell Faith you don't receive Faith
[12:23] faces and substance of things hoped for
[12:25] the evidence of Things Not Seen
[12:28] thank you
[12:30] Ministry explained now I hope this one
[12:34] thing and faith is another faith is a
[12:36] positive sense it's not a guesswork you
[12:38] don't just imagine it it's just as real
[12:40] as any other sense of your body just the
[12:42] same as sight sight is real hearing is
[12:44] real
[12:45] tasteful smell their sense of the body
[12:48] control the body they're real faculties
[12:50] that if one of them is injured you're
[12:53] let's say faculties to you if none of
[12:54] them is injured and then faith is just
[12:56] as real as any of these other five
[12:58] senses and more real because it'll go in
[13:00] and above those five senses
[13:04] so how do we get this great faith
[13:08] God condescended in his attributes so we
[13:10] could receive them right so you think of
[13:13] like
[13:15] brother Wade used to say this how do you
[13:17] eat an elephant this is a great big
[13:18] faith and we're wanting to come into
[13:19] this great big Faith well how do you eat
[13:21] a great big something like an elephant
[13:23] one bite at a time just a little at a
[13:25] time and you can you can do great things
[13:27] just by taking a little bit of this at a
[13:29] time the word of God every day read your
[13:31] Bible and pray every day listen sermons
[13:32] every day just a little bit at a time
[13:34] it's not impossible God condescendent
[13:36] and agape love
[13:38] by bringing it down to a form Called
[13:40] filial Love or we can get some little
[13:41] grasp of it some little piece of
[13:43] understanding of it same thing with the
[13:45] faith of God he gives us this great big
[13:47] faith in just a little bitty piece for
[13:49] us to understand just just a little
[13:50] portion of it this childlike Faith just
[13:52] believing God
[13:54] Romans 12 for I say through the grace
[13:56] given unto me to every man that is among
[13:58] you not to think of himself more highly
[13:59] than you ought to think but I think
[14:01] soberly according as God hath dealt to
[14:02] every man The Measure of Faith
[14:05] I've got just a few more here and then a
[14:08] video I want to show you all for an
[14:09] illustration
[14:10] Jesus Matthew 16 Jesus answered and said
[14:13] unto him blessed art thou Simon for
[14:15] Flesh and Blood now revealed unto thee
[14:17] but my father she's in heaven and I say
[14:18] unto thee Thou Art Peter and Upon This
[14:20] Rock about my church The Gates of Hell
[14:22] shall not Prevail against them
[14:25] so faith is a revelation and hell is
[14:28] against it but it won't prevail
[14:29] the angel of God why can't we do that
[14:32] why can't we have that simple faith if
[14:34] we'll just be so wouldn't be so trying
[14:36] to figure things out it happened right
[14:38] here just the same God's no respected
[14:39] person he just respects faith brother
[14:42] Aaron quote that the other night God
[14:44] doesn't heal you on the merits of your
[14:45] salvation it heals you on the merits of
[14:46] your faith
[14:48] now here's a quote not from Brother
[14:49] Branham I'll tell you in a minute who
[14:52] it's from if you're a child of God
[14:54] has to meet you somewhere he's got to
[14:58] he's obligated to his own children if
[15:01] you'll make yourself available say God
[15:03] take me somewhere
[15:05] I want to know more about you you all
[15:07] know who said that
[15:09] brother Wade
[15:11] last Sunday
[15:16] okay Matthew 21 and then when the
[15:19] disciples saw it they marveled saying
[15:20] how soon is a fig tree whether Jesus
[15:22] answered said to them but I say unto you
[15:24] if you have faith and doubting on you
[15:25] shall not only do this which is done to
[15:27] the Fig Tree but also if you shall say
[15:29] unto this mountain be thou removed be
[15:31] thou cast of The Sea it shall be done in
[15:33] all things whatsoever you should ask him
[15:35] forever believe in you shall receive
[15:41] faith is our Victory and faith is a
[15:43] victory that overcomes Every curse of
[15:44] the devil faith is a victory faith in
[15:46] what not faith in your church not faith
[15:49] in your Creed not faith in some man
[15:54] but faith in Jesus Christ who made the
[15:57] promise that and that's the victory what
[15:59] is the victory say my arm is still
[16:01] crippled but faith is a victory I still
[16:03] feel sick but faith is a victory it
[16:05] overcomes the world when you can climb
[16:07] into God by prayer until you see the
[16:09] thing conquered unto you there is
[16:10] nothing that can hurt you then you've
[16:11] overcome you've got 50 miles of Elbow
[16:13] Room that's brother Aaron also quoted
[16:15] that the other night you're still you're
[16:17] sailing free then
[16:19] now
[16:20] that's probably all I'm going to get to
[16:21] of my
[16:23] PowerPoint probably the rest of this
[16:24] will take my illustration here and y'all
[16:26] really pray for me because I have a
[16:28] thought that I really want to get to
[16:30] y'all I really hope
[16:31] I don't run out of time on this
[16:35] so the other day as well as last month I
[16:39] went on a flight I took mercy and I've
[16:42] uh up to walk a mountain which is a
[16:44] mountain between kind of between
[16:45] Cleveland and Gainesville and we live
[16:47] close to walk a mountain I've lived
[16:48] close to walking mountain since I was a
[16:50] little since I was about two years old
[16:52] I've always lived within about 10 or 20
[16:54] miles I've watched it my whole life I
[16:55] went to walk around that elementary
[16:56] school it's just always been a part of
[16:58] my life so I thought I'll take our girls
[17:00] and we'll do a little sightseeing we'll
[17:01] fly over and walk them out and then over
[17:02] our house then the next amount that took
[17:04] our other two Harmony and EULA
[17:07] flew them over the mountain same and
[17:08] over our house but there was a big
[17:10] difference between the two times we went
[17:12] the first time it was sunset and it was
[17:15] just overbearing so much light it was
[17:17] blinding and the Mist over the mountains
[17:19] around walk a mountain and all these
[17:21] mountains all around were just obscured
[17:23] from my view I didn't even notice them I
[17:24] knew they were there but I didn't even
[17:26] notice them and we're just taking
[17:27] pictures and videos then we went back
[17:29] and landed the next time I said where'd
[17:31] all these mountains come from because
[17:33] all of a sudden it was overcast it was
[17:35] raining a little bit when we got around
[17:37] the back side what I called the backside
[17:38] walk them out on the side opposite from
[17:40] the view of our house it was kind of
[17:41] rain and honest and it was clouds and
[17:43] all of a sudden we could see really
[17:44] clear for miles and miles around
[17:47] okay and I saw all these other mountains
[17:49] and I didn't hardly notice walk them out
[17:50] now I'm looking at all these other
[17:51] mountains in this range of I guess North
[17:53] Georgia Mountain Blue Ridge Mountains
[17:54] whatever all the mountains they were and
[17:56] I thought wow there's something to this
[17:58] so I went back and looked at the video
[17:59] and I figured out why it was because
[18:01] there's too much lights on that first
[18:02] flight so I said well there's something
[18:04] spiritual about that too if you think
[18:06] about it there's a lot of symbology in
[18:07] that when you come to faith in Christ at
[18:11] the very beginning when you believe
[18:12] you've come into a place remember I'll
[18:14] talk beginning about faith being a place
[18:15] you've come into this place and there's
[18:18] all these mountains but at the beginning
[18:19] you cannot see them because they're
[18:21] shrouded in unbelief all you see at the
[18:24] very beginning because that mist of sin
[18:26] all you see is maybe one mountain
[18:27] justification and if you keep around
[18:30] that one mountain long enough
[18:33] walk a mountain by the way is named
[18:35] after a man named Walker his last name
[18:36] was Walker if you think about walking as
[18:39] a Christian Journey you have to keep
[18:40] walking right you start believing in
[18:42] faith justification that mount
[18:44] justification you come to that first
[18:46] Mountain just keep on around that until
[18:48] you see Mountain sanctification come
[18:50] into view when you see that mountain now
[18:52] you've got two mountains in this whole
[18:54] big place called Faith there's a lot
[18:55] more out there that you don't see
[18:58] but you keep on going on this journey
[18:59] and you come to Mountain baptism the
[19:01] Holy Spirit you'll come to mount
[19:03] stature perfect man you come to mount uh
[19:06] you know faith for for Divine Healing
[19:08] for anything you have need of everything
[19:09] you have need of an Earth's Journey has
[19:11] given you when you're born again but you
[19:13] have to drink and push out just keep on
[19:14] going on this journey and walking is
[19:17] reading the bottom praying every day
[19:19] it's coming to churches listening to
[19:20] sermons keep on that journey and you'll
[19:22] see these other mountains coming to view
[19:23] I had no hope it looked like as a
[19:25] Baptist kid when I was 12 and gave my
[19:27] heart to the Lord came to that mount
[19:28] justification all I saw was walk a
[19:31] mountain I just kept walking and then
[19:33] one day I started reading my Bible every
[19:34] day and all of a sudden I came to
[19:36] sanctification the washing Water by the
[19:37] word I saw Mount sanctification come
[19:39] into view I kept going and I saw Mount
[19:42] baptism the holy spirit in 2015 and I
[19:44] kept going and I had no idea about this
[19:46] message that laid up ahead of me down
[19:48] the road you know in 2002.
[19:51] that was long on my journey and
[19:53] and all these other mountains you don't
[19:54] know what kind of mountains you're going
[19:55] to come to in your journey there's
[19:56] mountains of Victory mountains of uh
[19:59] Revelation Mountain well each one of
[20:01] these is really a revelation but there's
[20:03] all these little mountains of overcoming
[20:04] depression and lust and and fear and and
[20:07] anxiety and all these other kind of
[20:09] mountains these Mountain Top experiences
[20:11] you have but ironically the thing that
[20:14] kept me at the beginning at this first
[20:15] flight from seeing those mountains was
[20:17] the light the sunlight was overbearing
[20:20] and God knows how much light you can
[20:21] handle at one time so he gives you just
[20:24] a little at a time but that light was
[20:26] blind to me and it was obscuring the
[20:28] view of the mountains so I couldn't see
[20:29] him
[20:30] but if I once I when I kept going I
[20:33] could see there's other things come into
[20:34] view
[20:35] just keep these type of things in mind
[20:37] as we're
[20:39] y'all can play the sound I don't know
[20:41] that'll work
[20:49] if they can't get the sound going that's
[20:50] okay
[20:51] but that's me and mercy and I've on that
[20:53] first flight
[21:05] also I'll mention too last Sunday
[21:07] brother John Durant mentioned patiently
[21:08] waiting on God's timing
[21:12] oh yeah gotcha thank you what's up
[21:16] if y'all don't get it going it's no
[21:18] problem it's no big deal I can just keep
[21:19] talking over it
[21:21] because you'll still get the point just
[21:22] from watching it
[21:35] but mountains are symbolic of permanent
[21:37] things because you know that anytime you
[21:38] think of a mountain you think of
[21:39] something permanent something big and
[21:41] solid it's always going to be there
[21:42] until someone has Faith to move
[21:44] mountains you know it's always going to
[21:45] be standing right there you know you can
[21:48] always rely that that mountain is going
[21:49] to be in the same spot every time you
[21:50] look in that same area and when you have
[21:53] all these permanent things that
[21:54] justification of mine in when I was 12
[21:56] was permanent I knew when I gave my
[21:58] heart to the Lord at 12 I'm going all
[21:59] the way with the Lord I'm never going to
[22:01] stop if I live to be 100 years old I'm
[22:02] still going to be serving Christ I knew
[22:04] that as a little Baptist kid not knowing
[22:06] about everything that laid my journey
[22:07] not knowing that I come to the message
[22:08] not no one that I come to something
[22:10] called sanctification that was not even
[22:11] in my psyche there was there's nobody
[22:13] even taught that in the Baptist Church
[22:15] they said just
[22:16] plead the blood you can't help what you
[22:18] do just plead the blood which literally
[22:19] means just keep messing up keep doing
[22:22] the wrong things you do cussing whatever
[22:24] else you do wrong just plead the blood
[22:26] ask God to forgive you you'll be all
[22:27] right
[22:29] but that was that first flight and
[22:30] there's you can kind of see the form the
[22:33] shape of the mountains off in the
[22:34] Horizon but you can't see them clearly
[22:36] as we could on this next flight and then
[22:38] we started on that next flight though it
[22:40] was cloudy though it was even raining at
[22:42] times we got on the back side of the
[22:44] mountain like this back side of the
[22:46] desert experience
[22:47] and all of a sudden these other
[22:48] mountains came into Clear View
[22:52] that was used to flying the plane
[23:17] and while that's still going I'll go and
[23:18] start talk about this most important one
[23:20] I want to get to is Mountain Divine
[23:21] Healing
[23:22] I came to mount Divine Healing somewhere
[23:25] in about 2015 or 2016. most of you don't
[23:28] well maybe some of you've heard a little
[23:30] bit over the years uh I've battled on
[23:32] and off with ulcerative colitis which is
[23:34] ulcers in the colon bleeding ulcers and
[23:36] in 2015 I had the worst episode of it
[23:38] ever and I didn't as far as I recall if
[23:40] I did anything at all here I'll probably
[23:42] turn in prayer requests like an unspoken
[23:43] I learned a long time ago faith for
[23:46] Divine Healing is basically two things
[23:48] you believe in your heart confess with
[23:51] your mouth and both those are to me are
[23:53] equally important so uh I wouldn't go
[23:56] around whining and complaining and even
[23:57] telling anybody my my mindset has always
[24:00] been on just keep my mouth shut about it
[24:02] I'm just if anything I might say pray
[24:03] for me I'm having a problem
[24:05] but I'm not going to talk about all the
[24:07] circumstances and I'm going to do my
[24:09] best to act like I'm Healed until my
[24:11] body agrees with it
[24:13] and uh when I listened to brother
[24:16] Brandon for the 40th time talk about
[24:17] brother John Ryan finally it quickened
[24:20] to me and the sort of the Mist of my own
[24:23] belief rolled away and I saw him out
[24:24] healing like I'd never seen her before
[24:26] Mount Divine Healing in plain view all
[24:28] of a sudden I realized was you believe
[24:30] God no matter what no matter what
[24:33] happens no matter how low you get you
[24:35] keep believing God and stand there in
[24:36] faith and believe in God no matter what
[24:39] and don't confess the circumstances
[24:42] John Ryan come up for prayer about being
[24:44] blind and he went away and he was
[24:46] brother Banner said you're healed and he
[24:48] went away and still couldn't see so he
[24:49] came back to the Altar and said I
[24:52] thought you said I was healed mother
[24:53] Banner said I thought you said you
[24:54] believed when that was quick in the draw
[24:55] and run he went away and also and
[24:57] started confessing it until it happened
[24:59] and I believe he would have confessed it
[25:01] his eyes never came open because he had
[25:02] the Revelation that it's a long-range
[25:04] Vision you see that you're healed even
[25:06] if your body don't declare it no matter
[25:08] what happens you see that you're healed
[25:09] and you accept it and you believe it no
[25:11] matter what
[25:12] and um then brother Banner himself had
[25:15] that stomach ailment that was terrible
[25:17] he was living on a liquid diet finally
[25:19] said well I'd rather die you know if I
[25:22] want to eat solid food if it kills me
[25:23] basically I think is what he said on one
[25:25] place I heard him say
[25:27] so he started installing food and the
[25:28] doctor told him it would kill him he did
[25:30] it anyway and it tried to come back up
[25:32] and he swallowed it back down and came
[25:33] back up and he swallowed it back down so
[25:35] finally somebody said how you doing
[25:36] brother man he said I'm doing well you
[25:38] know praise the Lord for helping me or
[25:39] whatever and he kept acting like he was
[25:41] healed even though his body didn't
[25:42] didn't say that that he was healed but
[25:45] yet he acted like he was healed and I
[25:47] had a similar thing with this uh one of
[25:49] these episodes of leading ulcers losing
[25:52] a lot of blood and even being basically
[25:53] borderline anemic weak and feverish and
[25:55] everything else and not saying a word
[25:57] anybody here the only one that knew it
[25:58] was Gabby and
[26:01] um
[26:01] I wouldn't say a word to anybody I'd
[26:03] just keep confessing that I'm Healed and
[26:05] now I'm perfectly fine not not a symptom
[26:07] at all
[26:09] but I won't stop if it shows up again
[26:11] tomorrow I'll still be sailing thank you
[26:13] Lord for healing me
[26:17] very soon
[26:21] obviously I have sister Freight on my
[26:23] mind a lot so um just keep her in mind
[26:26] that's why I mentioned that is for
[26:27] mostly for her
[26:29] and um we're all standing with her in
[26:31] prayer
[26:35] that's the first flight that shows you
[26:37] just how much the mountains and
[26:38] everything was obscured by that
[26:40] by that uh mist and the sun lighten it
[26:43] up and everything
[26:45] turn
[26:46] your musicians can go ahead and come up
[26:56] and the second flight there still was
[26:58] missed over the mountains but we could
[27:00] still see him because the sun was not
[27:02] shining them so bright so when you're
[27:03] going through those cloudy days and even
[27:05] some rain
[27:06] just know that God has a plan he has a
[27:08] purpose for all of that
[27:10] he's got this all in control he knows
[27:12] what he's doing
[27:18] God bless y'all thank you
[27:25] thank you
[27:33] [Music]
