[4:22] to our hearts and our lives in jesus
[4:24] name
[4:25] amen
[4:28] romans 8 28
[4:32] for we know that all things work
[4:33] together for good to them that love god
[4:36] to them who are the called according to
[4:38] his purpose
[4:39] for whom he did for know he also did
[4:41] predestinate to be conformed to the
[4:44] image of his son
[4:46] that he might be the firstborn among
[4:48] many brethren
[4:49] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[4:52] he also called and whom he called him he
[4:54] also justified and whom he justified
[4:57] them he also glorified
[4:59] and i love that part this is about 18
[5:02] times we've read this scripture
[5:04] on the services so i love that don't you
[5:07] what shall we then say to these things
[5:10] all of this above what can we say if god
[5:12] be for us
[5:14] who can be against us amen let's go over
[5:16] to job
[5:18] and just read
[5:20] job
[5:21] because that's where i thought we'll be
[5:23] connecting to the day
[5:25] you have it up from the fourth verse but
[5:27] we'll start verse one then the lord
[5:29] answered job out of the whirlwind and
[5:30] said what is this that darkeneth counsel
[5:33] by words without knowledge
[5:35] group now thou loins like a man now
[5:37] listen to it
[5:39] you know he tells him another time
[5:41] to stand up amen you know all right
[5:44] for i will demand of thee and the answer
[5:46] that i mean
[5:47] where was thou when i laid the
[5:49] foundation of the earth declare if thou
[5:51] hast understanding
[5:53] who hath laid the measures thereof
[5:56] if thou knowest or who has
[5:58] stretches the line upon it whereupon are
[6:00] the foundations there are facing
[6:03] or who laid the cornerstone thereof
[6:06] when the morning stars signed together
[6:09] and all the sons of god shouted for joy
[6:11] you may be seated the lord had his
[6:13] blessing to the
[6:14] reading of the word
[6:17] now
[6:19] we have been
[6:21] uh to some of you new ones that
[6:24] think about it jesus
[6:25] he reads the same scripture
[6:27] i have read the same scripture 100 times
[6:29] and preached 100 services off of it so i
[6:32] don't worry about 18 you know you can't
[6:35] wear out the word of god
[6:37] you can't uh there's no way to do it
[6:40] it's eternal so we'll maybe we'll get to
[6:42] the point one of these days and we'll
[6:43] see it we can look back and see how
[6:45] eternal it really is
[6:47] but what we've been talking about now
[6:50] we've been talking about
[6:52] how does god predestinate
[6:56] how does he predestinate
[6:58] all right we found that he predestinates
[7:00] before knowledge
[7:02] all right and we found a prophet as
[7:04] saying
[7:05] that
[7:06] predestination looks back to
[7:08] foreknowledge
[7:10] see then foreknowledge comes before
[7:12] predestination
[7:14] all right because see predestination is
[7:17] setting a destiny
[7:19] all right to set a destiny you must
[7:21] first have knowledge
[7:23] of what that would do in god see uh even
[7:27] we said a a project brother tim's
[7:29] working on a project there in florida
[7:31] they set a project to do so and so and
[7:33] so and so and so and so all right now
[7:35] they had a lot of foreknowledge before
[7:37] then because
[7:39] uh that was what gave them the idea or
[7:42] the thought or the doings to to do that
[7:45] but see in god now he
[7:47] foreknew all things as we've read here
[7:50] so then he could predestinate by his
[7:52] foreknowledge
[7:54] all right then that way uh even election
[7:57] the prophet said is set by foreknowledge
[7:59] yes so then if we get that correct in
[8:01] our mind we'll see foreknowledge is a
[8:03] very important thing we used to want to
[8:06] all lay everything on predestination
[8:09] and then you had the baptists of
[8:11] presbyterians you had the different
[8:13] churches that taught those doctrines
[8:15] coming down
[8:17] and we got hooked up on just a
[8:19] predetermining factor of a lot of things
[8:21] you know and
[8:23] as we did then
[8:25] we had to get away from that to begin to
[8:27] see the message of the hour of the bible
[8:30] it says those who he foreknew
[8:32] he did predestinate our for no see all
[8:35] right now
[8:37] so we know that the prophet says god
[8:40] doesn't predestinate by his desires
[8:44] because he desired that everybody be
[8:45] saved
[8:46] he predestinates by his
[8:50] foreknowledge all right and really it's
[8:53] because of your desire
[8:57] if you want to determine anything on
[8:58] predestination remember your destiny is
[9:01] set because of your desire
[9:04] what you desire
[9:05] is what god works on
[9:07] and if you desire to serve god he'll
[9:08] make a way amen
[9:11] but if you don't desire to do that then
[9:13] he doesn't have to worry about it
[9:14] because you're making your own choice
[9:16] see then he made us all free moral
[9:18] agents
[9:20] to be able to choose what we would do
[9:23] and free moral agency then is to do and
[9:26] you say yeah but god chose me yeah but
[9:29] just remember if you do not accept
[9:34] what he uh
[9:37] in his choosing you've got to accept it
[9:40] because if you don't accept it he won't
[9:41] override your free moral agency
[9:43] all right see then we must accept
[9:45] salvation amen
[9:48] to not to just say well i always was
[9:51] all right now we we went through the
[9:52] message and and the doings of the
[9:54] prophet to cover all of these things
[9:57] and and we'll we'll keep on going
[9:59] through until we we uh get on
[10:01] and what we want to do today is bring
[10:04] this message and then we're going to try
[10:06] to start going back in another direction
[10:10] uh because you know what i've been doing
[10:12] now for months is bringing up for
[10:14] knowledge
[10:15] then we got into
[10:17] the mind of god
[10:19] all right because i do not believe that
[10:21] there was any people back there with god
[10:24] because he wouldn't be self-existing
[10:26] all right now if if that part would be
[10:29] people there like are as the uh
[10:32] mormons believe
[10:34] that we were back there with him and
[10:37] some of the others believing in the soul
[10:39] part
[10:40] and trying to make pre-existence out of
[10:43] things
[10:44] well i believe in pre-existence
[10:46] of eternal life
[10:48] amen
[10:49] that's the only pre-existence i can
[10:51] believe in amen is eternal life and
[10:54] eternal life is god
[10:56] all right that's god's own life see
[10:58] i i noticed yesterday brother random
[11:00] asked the question he said are there two
[11:02] eternal lives he said no
[11:04] there's just one
[11:06] there's just one eternal life
[11:08] all right then that eternal life that we
[11:11] have
[11:13] i'm a firm believer
[11:16] then and always have taught it this way
[11:18] to believe it
[11:19] that
[11:23] you and i
[11:26] were not back there as people
[11:28] we were not back there in any form other
[11:31] than the form of the eternal amen
[11:35] all right so then if we are part of the
[11:37] eternal
[11:40] then the part of the eternal that we are
[11:43] was in god
[11:44] all right i agree with that so then i
[11:47] believe we must receive eternal life
[11:50] by the new birth
[11:51] all right then that means that
[11:55] i didn't come with it
[11:57] but i come with all of the uh things
[12:00] making ready for it because god knew
[12:03] that i want eternal life so he had to
[12:06] die to release that life
[12:08] there is no salvation the old testament
[12:10] saints they do not they didn't have
[12:12] eternal life
[12:14] because jesus christ the bible said
[12:15] hadn't died yet
[12:17] so when he died he released that life
[12:19] yes one of the old testament saints will
[12:21] never be the bride they'll be the old
[12:23] testament jehovah bride yeah
[12:26] the israels
[12:28] of god but they'll never be the bride
[12:30] because see that that's a specific
[12:33] designation all right
[12:35] then to receive eternal life
[12:38] that eternal life you receive
[12:42] always was eternal amen amen so i can
[12:45] say now within me i have eternal life by
[12:47] the new birth and that life always was
[12:49] eternal that's right okay
[12:52] we're right we're in the message see we
[12:54] can follow
[12:55] and not have any problems with it so
[12:58] then i i was going through there the
[13:00] last couple of services where brother
[13:01] man said and he gave the question if
[13:04] that's right if you've got eternal life
[13:07] that's 17 times
[13:10] i mean if you got it right there's a
[13:12] question
[13:12] and it was about eight times if we have
[13:15] or if you have
[13:16] all right there's a question to it if we
[13:19] have eternal life the eternal life we
[13:21] have always wasn't eternal
[13:24] and i like to illustrate it like that
[13:26] john says
[13:28] that his seed remain within us and we
[13:30] cannot sin
[13:33] now that doesn't mean we can't do wrong
[13:36] because we're human beings we're mortals
[13:39] we do wrong every day we make mistakes
[13:41] every day we got all kind of problems
[13:43] all right but that seed cannot sin
[13:47] you're not dealing about the person
[13:49] you're dealing about the seed so if i
[13:51] have eternal life
[13:53] then that eternal life that i have
[13:55] always was eternal and is a part of god
[13:59] and it's not a second person as a son of
[14:02] god as we call it in the terms of our
[14:04] word because you'd have eternal sonship
[14:07] amen
[14:08] you remember we gave it where the
[14:09] prophet said he believed in eternal
[14:11] godship
[14:13] but not eternal sonship
[14:15] a son can't be eternal he said well
[14:17] jesus was the son of god he was god made
[14:20] manifest in flesh called a son
[14:23] that's right
[14:24] he was god manifested called a son
[14:27] because there's no such thing as you
[14:29] know god the father god the son god the
[14:32] holy ghost that's not in the bible
[14:34] that's right
[14:36] because that would make the trinity run
[14:38] and it won't work because we believe in
[14:39] one true and living god all right
[14:42] so we spent so much time
[14:44] i'm hoping you're not losing that point
[14:47] that
[14:48] we back went back as brother brown said
[14:50] in christ the mystery god revealed that
[14:52] we can go back into the back part of
[14:54] god's mind
[14:57] and see that god had a plan and a
[14:59] purpose
[15:01] he had a motive in doing it to let
[15:02] himself be expressed
[15:04] all right and in doing that everything
[15:07] was
[15:08] foreknown of him
[15:12] no problem with that then by
[15:14] foreknowledge he knew jacob
[15:17] would desire the birthright but he knew
[15:20] esau would reject it so he could write
[15:22] it down and say
[15:24] jacob have i love he saw how i hate it
[15:27] before they were ever even born
[15:30] why because if it's for knowledge
[15:33] unknowing what they would do
[15:35] when they got here
[15:37] all right now
[15:39] but doing that part we go back there and
[15:41] see that
[15:42] there was nothing existing but god alone
[15:46] so if there's any part that we even talk
[15:48] about
[15:49] as to be eternal
[15:52] yes
[15:53] right it would mean that would have to
[15:56] be part of god
[15:58] the new birth eternal life you receive
[16:01] the baptism of the holy ghost the new
[16:03] birth that is god's own life imparted
[16:07] into you
[16:10] it's not
[16:11] a second person
[16:12] amen brother said jesus said god is not
[16:15] a first person second person
[16:18] he said he's the person
[16:21] person of eternal life what about that
[16:24] all right
[16:25] but what we're trying to do now we're
[16:27] going to get this message out of the way
[16:28] and then this afternoon we'll start
[16:30] condescending more downwardly coming
[16:33] back into
[16:35] life and time and predestination and for
[16:38] knowledge
[16:39] and dealing with it
[16:41] but i want to get this one out of the
[16:42] way because of where it is placed at
[16:46] and by looking at eternal life
[16:49] eternal life has no beginning and has no
[16:52] end
[16:53] all right
[16:54] so then if it is it would have to be
[16:56] part of god's own life
[16:59] and we had the questions and answers
[17:01] this past wednesday that even the
[17:03] foolish virgins will receive eternal
[17:06] life that's right at the white throne
[17:08] but that doesn't make them bright amen
[17:11] why because they had nothing to do with
[17:13] it here they didn't receive eternal life
[17:15] here
[17:16] so they must go to the white throne but
[17:18] that eternal life that he gives them
[17:20] will be eternal life amen
[17:23] right but it will not make them the
[17:25] bride of christ
[17:27] all right
[17:28] 144 000 receive eternal life here
[17:34] right yes
[17:36] but that will not make them the bride
[17:39] that's right a lot of difference in the
[17:40] bride and where we stand because the
[17:42] bride is not now i've hounded this and
[17:45] hounded this on to you hoping you would
[17:48] understand me
[17:49] not trying to make you believe it but
[17:51] telling you what i believe
[17:52] and i'm not trying to prove any doctrine
[17:54] wrong
[17:55] that's not my
[17:57] do it my point is to tell what truth is
[18:00] amen all right the prophet said we're
[18:02] not trying to set a doctrine he said
[18:04] we're trying to correct
[18:06] all right seeing our thoughts must be
[18:08] put into the right channel that's right
[18:11] and i've emphasized over and over that
[18:13] we say you know we the people who say
[18:16] well the new birth
[18:18] makes me a son of god
[18:21] all right that's wonderful
[18:23] but what do you mean
[18:25] are you a son of jesus that was the son
[18:27] of god
[18:29] so your grandchildren
[18:34] but if we have eternal life dwelling in
[18:36] us
[18:38] just as jesus was god made manifest
[18:42] you agree
[18:44] not a second person or a third
[18:47] he didn't send a son he came himself
[18:49] amen we're not oneness
[18:52] we're true oneness true understanding
[18:54] all right now then as jesus was god made
[18:58] manifest in flesh
[19:00] the fullness of the godhead could dwell
[19:02] in him
[19:03] but you and i it can't dwell in us why
[19:05] because we're a many member body but the
[19:07] fullness of the godhead can dwell into
[19:10] the body of christ
[19:11] that's right all right
[19:13] i believe in that
[19:14] all right that would make us god
[19:16] manifest that's right amen
[19:19] the children of god yes
[19:23] your children are part of you amen right
[19:26] amen and see then the children of god
[19:29] watch it till when we get over here
[19:30] about the morning starts
[19:32] saying together and the sons of god
[19:33] shall enjoy if we have time
[19:36] uh
[19:37] watch that relate together with
[19:40] god in his doings if we have time to get
[19:42] there so we'll try to hurry up
[19:46] but now
[19:47] i want you to start with me and think
[19:49] about it
[19:51] if we wasn't back there
[19:55] god dwelt alone
[20:00] then
[20:02] he had attributes
[20:07] his attributes was father son and holy
[20:09] ghost that's his three attributes
[20:11] all right
[20:12] so if we have anything or any connection
[20:14] we must be connected through
[20:16] those
[20:18] attributes
[20:20] all right he had attributes to being a
[20:22] savior a healer
[20:24] right
[20:26] all right that would mean somewhere
[20:29] they would be somebody that would be
[20:33] right sick there was no need of him
[20:34] having an attribute
[20:37] there would be somewhere that somebody
[20:39] would need saving
[20:42] there would be no need of him having an
[20:43] attribute but just remember he never
[20:45] gained attributes
[20:47] he displayed after this
[20:50] he always had his attributes
[20:53] and see he then dwelt alone
[20:56] as the prophet would say with his
[20:57] attributes amen
[21:00] he said well that put us back there well
[21:02] now what is an attribute
[21:06] all right
[21:08] see what is an attribute we'll get to
[21:10] that in a second just that brother
[21:11] random ask the question
[21:14] but see he dwelt alone
[21:17] and he dwelt alone
[21:20] with his thoughts
[21:21] yes
[21:23] right
[21:25] god dwelt along with his thoughts
[21:29] all right
[21:31] but see now his thoughts are being
[21:33] displayed who do who do you say this is
[21:36] uh 1964 1227
[21:39] but said he'll never do that again
[21:44] god dwelt alone with his thoughts
[21:47] he'll never do that again
[21:50] right why
[21:52] because his thoughts are being made
[21:54] manifest
[21:56] he'll never dwell alone that's why when
[21:57] you come through the bible and you you
[21:59] pick up the words and the understanding
[22:01] it'll go from god in genesis 1 but it'll
[22:04] go to lord god
[22:06] in genesis 2 you know like that why
[22:09] because it's him displaying himself
[22:13] manifesting himself all right but he
[22:16] dwelt alone
[22:18] now if we were ever there if there's
[22:21] ever thoughts about eternal life
[22:23] as that we always was eternal then
[22:25] you're going to have to deal with
[22:28] that we were there only in his thoughts
[22:32] in his mind
[22:34] all right
[22:36] but now have you been listening
[22:39] see
[22:40] my kids cannot i didn't sit down and
[22:42] think well now me and me and piggy we're
[22:44] going to get married and we're going to
[22:46] have three kids
[22:47] and we're going to name one wade and one
[22:49] terrence and one anna
[22:51] no
[22:52] see that's our doings
[22:56] you know we get married and we may talk
[22:58] it about it you know maybe some of you
[23:00] talked when you were dating you know and
[23:02] how many kids do we want to have when we
[23:03] get married
[23:04] well you know you someone one two five
[23:07] or whatever you know
[23:08] and uh i'm just glad mom and daddy they
[23:11] must have done a lot of talking
[23:14] because i'm the 13th one
[23:17] so i'm glad they've done a lot of
[23:19] talking all right
[23:23] all right
[23:24] but now think about it
[23:27] see that's us us in our thoughts
[23:31] see my thoughts can't be eternal
[23:33] now if god reveals something to me
[23:35] it comes as a thought right amen
[23:38] see
[23:40] first he spoke to moses
[23:42] it was moses thought then moses went out
[23:44] and said flies fleas frogs see
[23:47] all right that's a good point but see
[23:49] our thoughts are human thoughts that's
[23:51] why the bible said his ways is not our
[23:53] ways his thoughts are not our
[23:55] it's so much high above until we're not
[23:57] even in the picture but now think about
[24:00] it
[24:02] i do believe earnestly
[24:05] that god
[24:07] in his thoughts
[24:09] are more real than we think
[24:14] the prophet in the church age book said
[24:15] his thoughts are eternal
[24:18] all right he cannot have another thought
[24:20] we can think one day and then think
[24:21] another way but god can't
[24:23] when he said he'd save the first person
[24:25] by the blood he has to save everybody by
[24:27] the blood
[24:28] he can't change
[24:30] i mean
[24:31] he can't have a new thought
[24:33] because if he could have a new thought
[24:34] he wouldn't be god
[24:36] that's right he would just be like you
[24:38] and i
[24:39] now he can bring forth a thought
[24:43] and keep adding to the thought or more
[24:46] clarification like in genesis he said i
[24:48] put image between thy seed and the seed
[24:50] of the woman the promise of christ
[24:52] all right
[24:53] then come on over later and say that
[24:55] would come through abraham
[24:56] and then say it would come through david
[24:58] and then say it would be jesus christ
[25:00] that's
[25:01] bringing the thought and continuing it
[25:03] on
[25:04] that is not having a new thought he
[25:06] didn't go so far and think oh got to do
[25:08] something so he changed around went the
[25:10] other way you know no
[25:12] you got to remember we're talking about
[25:14] god
[25:15] being the infinite one
[25:18] and how else could you explain infinite
[25:20] than to say
[25:22] and i hate gnats
[25:24] they bother me
[25:26] he said now trying to deer hunting the
[25:28] gnats is all over the place you just you
[25:30] might as well go home
[25:31] you know
[25:32] all right
[25:34] but what about knowing every nap that
[25:35] there would be in the world
[25:37] and how many times that nap would bat
[25:39] its eye
[25:42] and how much taller that nat would make
[25:45] now that's just a human terminologies to
[25:47] understand an infinite god yes
[25:51] don't think you're going to pull
[25:52] anything over on him
[25:54] all right
[25:56] he knew before the world where we'd be
[25:58] today
[25:59] and what we'd be doing and what we'd be
[26:01] thinking
[26:02] if he didn't he's not god
[26:04] all right
[26:05] now then god's thoughts
[26:08] are more real
[26:11] you know i'm trying to get a point and
[26:12] then we'll go on to the
[26:15] then the point i've been trying to get
[26:16] you to see that we're the children of
[26:18] god
[26:19] i've been emphasizing that we are his
[26:21] offspring as paul said and being his
[26:24] children
[26:26] means that we're a part of him
[26:29] right we're a part of him
[26:31] all right now being a part of him
[26:35] did he think about us
[26:38] i know i ask odd questions
[26:40] i like to do that but at least you'll go
[26:42] home and think
[26:43] did he set up er
[26:45] well i could just have some kids
[26:49] and i might have a few of this and a few
[26:50] of that and i'll have some big ones and
[26:52] little ones and
[26:55] and i'll make a world
[26:57] and i'll make mountains and valleys and
[27:00] hills and
[27:01] did he sit there and think
[27:05] then his thought wasn't eternal
[27:09] if we lay on the basis that he thought
[27:11] about us
[27:12] be careful how you bring that relation
[27:14] because if he thought about us then
[27:17] there's no way for us to be eternal
[27:20] come on
[27:23] but if we were a part of that thought
[27:26] that's why i've always emphasized to you
[27:28] 40 years
[27:30] i don't want to be just what god thought
[27:32] of in his mind because judas is carrick
[27:34] was in god's mind just as well as
[27:36] anybody else that's right all right i
[27:39] want to be a part of the thinker
[27:42] you know
[27:44] somebody may have to translate that in
[27:45] some foreign country so just remember
[27:47] what i'm saying
[27:49] i want to be part of god
[27:53] not just something of a
[27:56] that he created that's right
[28:00] if he created you you had a beginning
[28:05] come on
[28:07] but if we're a part of him
[28:09] then there is no beginning
[28:10] all right then that way his stalks
[28:14] see he's not able to shut what would it
[28:15] be
[28:16] his thoughts are his attributes
[28:23] all right
[28:24] father son and holy ghost his attributes
[28:27] his thoughts is his attributes
[28:31] now
[28:32] in that he he wanted to be a father son
[28:34] and holy ghost right
[28:38] that's the thoughts of god that's the
[28:39] attributes of god all right to be that
[28:44] then
[28:45] we have to be somewhere connected in
[28:47] there
[28:49] to have eternal life
[28:51] all right so now his attributes
[28:55] that's who we are
[28:59] look what he said on number three pull
[29:00] it up for certain
[29:02] preaching
[29:03] 1964 the token
[29:05] we are the attributes of his thoughts
[29:09] all right
[29:10] and that's god's loyalty then you have
[29:13] it then you have eternal life because he
[29:16] is the only eternal there he is and we
[29:18] are the attributes of his thoughts
[29:21] before there was even a foundation of
[29:23] the world or anything
[29:24] all of this is just his thinking
[29:28] listen to him
[29:31] and we're the display of his thoughts
[29:33] of what it was
[29:36] see then he didn't sit down and think
[29:38] about us
[29:42] we have to use those terminologies what
[29:44] else could you use how else could you
[29:46] explain it
[29:49] we're going back into his mind
[29:54] he
[29:55] his thoughts is just as eternal as he is
[30:00] all right
[30:01] what is an attribute look at it marriage
[30:03] and divorce 1965
[30:05] talk to number four
[30:09] you know that god god is an object of
[30:11] worship
[30:13] and there wasn't nothing to worship him
[30:15] he lived alone and in him was attributes
[30:18] what is an attribute
[30:21] now in him was attributes to be a healer
[30:24] to be a savior to be a redeemer et
[30:25] cetera
[30:27] to be father son and holy ghost to make
[30:28] manifest that upon earth
[30:31] right
[30:32] because he would have to come and die
[30:34] for our sins to be the savior and to be
[30:37] beaten to be the healer
[30:39] so that would mean he would have to come
[30:41] into that as we call it sonship
[30:44] life existence
[30:46] upon earth
[30:48] all right
[30:49] then in doing that what are we
[30:51] what is an attribute a thought
[30:56] a thought
[30:59] it was in him to be fathers in him to be
[31:01] god it was in him to be son it was in
[31:02] him to be savior within him to be healer
[31:05] and all these things here are just
[31:06] displaying his attributes
[31:08] all right
[31:10] what is an attribute
[31:13] what are god's attributes his
[31:16] thoughts what are we his thoughts being
[31:19] displayed
[31:21] right
[31:23] all right then in dealing with that
[31:27] to be that part
[31:28] there would be only one way we could do
[31:30] that and you'll see that i firmly
[31:33] believe in it look at look at the next
[31:35] one
[31:40] all right let's see i don't think i give
[31:42] them to
[31:43] paragraph 29 you gotta roll it on that
[31:47] this is taken from
[31:49] why i'm against organized religion
[31:53] and when we are born again of the spirit
[31:56] of god
[31:57] we become eternal with god because we
[32:00] have part of his life
[32:05] which makes us sons and daughters of god
[32:08] then we have eternal life
[32:10] and the life that is in us now
[32:12] god will raise up the body et cetera all
[32:15] of the things will take place what is it
[32:18] we have part of his life
[32:21] as i say in a while ago then the reason
[32:23] you use the word part is because none of
[32:26] us can be the fullness
[32:29] so we would be apart
[32:32] all right
[32:34] jesus was the fullness
[32:36] all right being a part of his life
[32:38] all right look what he says on who is
[32:40] this melchizedek
[32:44] you were there in his attributes
[32:47] you don't remember it
[32:49] no
[32:50] because you're just a part of his life
[32:54] you are part of god when you become a
[32:56] son and daughter of god
[32:58] all right that's coming back down on
[33:00] this side coming down to when we will
[33:02] start talking about the new birth
[33:04] all right
[33:05] but an attribute
[33:08] an attribute
[33:10] is a part of god
[33:13] and as i said now the foolish virgin
[33:18] will one day receive eternal life
[33:20] right
[33:21] people at the white throne will receive
[33:23] eternal life correct filth sealed you
[33:25] will receive eternal life
[33:27] uh the different ones that will receive
[33:29] eternal life
[33:30] now you know for certainty they're not a
[33:32] part of god
[33:38] because they will have to receive it
[33:40] but once they receive it they will
[33:42] receive it as an impartation
[33:45] and that impartation will be the part of
[33:47] god which is life we'll get to adam
[33:51] maybe this afternoon or further down
[33:54] see adam had nothing to do with what he
[33:57] had
[33:58] god gave him blasphemous names
[34:01] eternal life
[34:03] breathed into his nostrils
[34:06] but everybody after adam and eve
[34:10] they didn't receive eternal life when it
[34:11] was born
[34:14] you'd have to admit some didn't so then
[34:16] you can go with that thought all right
[34:20] that they don't receive eternal life
[34:22] all right
[34:23] now if god dwelt alone
[34:27] and it was self-existing
[34:31] see i don't have any trouble with the
[34:33] eternal life that he has that i now have
[34:37] all right you understand me
[34:39] eternal life that he is that i now have
[34:42] amen
[34:44] that eternal life that we have by the
[34:46] new birth
[34:47] always was eternal
[34:49] i have no problem with that because
[34:50] that's beautiful
[34:52] if not you'd be a child of jesus and be
[34:54] a child of god that make your grandchild
[34:58] then it won't work so jesus had to be
[35:00] almighty god
[35:03] not a second person amen well i always
[35:05] thought he was the son of god no he was
[35:07] god manifested in the flesh called the
[35:09] son
[35:14] that was why that he
[35:16] was killed
[35:18] not for saying he was the son of god
[35:20] go back and read your bible matthew mark
[35:22] luke and john you'll find out he was
[35:23] killed for saying they said you're a man
[35:25] making yourself god they didn't say
[35:28] you're a man making yourself a son of
[35:29] god
[35:31] they said you're a man making yourself
[35:32] god and we don't believe that
[35:34] but yet their whole teaching was that he
[35:36] would eventually come
[35:38] and would be that
[35:39] because they were looking for the
[35:40] messiah
[35:42] they just didn't believe that was the
[35:43] messiah
[35:45] you know why
[35:46] because they thought they might get to
[35:47] be it themselves
[35:50] there's that ego we go back to
[35:53] why did them pharisees what right
[35:56] did the pharisees and the sadducees
[35:58] religious leaders how to reject jesus
[36:00] christ
[36:03] i want a sensible explanation that used
[36:05] to bother me in the baptist church when
[36:06] i was there i studied the word of god
[36:08] and i used to read i thought why in the
[36:09] world do they hate that man all he did
[36:11] was heal the and fed him
[36:13] right
[36:14] how about getting a meal any time you
[36:15] want it
[36:17] and how about when you're sick it just
[36:18] heals you if you die you just raise you
[36:20] up that's right
[36:25] where did they have any right to reject
[36:27] him
[36:32] because he didn't come the way they
[36:33] thought that's right
[36:37] all right
[36:38] what in the high priest
[36:40] i believe he's god
[36:43] because if he's the messiah that's who
[36:44] he's got to be
[36:47] no he wouldn't get up and do that
[36:48] you know why because he didn't come down
[36:51] and bow down and kiss kaffi's big toe
[36:53] that's right
[36:54] does that bring you down to the day
[36:57] done over in the catholic church you
[36:59] know
[36:59] all right not against them just telling
[37:01] you like it is
[37:04] but you see confidence had it figured
[37:05] out
[37:08] that one day there'd be a great blast
[37:10] come out of heaven
[37:12] and there'd be somebody and just roll a
[37:14] carpet right out
[37:15] and he'd end right at confidence's feet
[37:18] and he'd walk right up the confidence
[37:19] and say i'm
[37:20] here
[37:22] right
[37:23] you tell me any other reason for
[37:25] rejecting him
[37:29] he didn't come the way they thought he'd
[37:31] come
[37:32] yet the bible said he would come that
[37:33] way
[37:34] the bible said he'd be born a virgin
[37:37] yes the bible said it would be god
[37:40] manifested in flesh
[37:43] see the jews today are looking for a
[37:45] messiah and they believe a messiah will
[37:47] be
[37:48] god in human flesh that's right now
[37:51] there's about 49 different versions
[37:54] you'll go check it all out
[37:55] they had a god here in new york not too
[37:57] long ago 90 something years old they
[37:59] thought he was a messiah
[38:01] but he died
[38:03] it didn't fit too good
[38:05] but listen church
[38:08] i'm talking about god's children
[38:11] as to being part of god
[38:16] see that would be
[38:19] the children of god
[38:23] but not exist back there as people's
[38:27] identities
[38:30] of course i can show you where the
[38:31] prophet said
[38:33] that before the world he knew exactly
[38:36] your height
[38:37] your hair color your eye color
[38:40] everything about you yes amen
[38:44] if he didn't he ain't gone
[38:47] that's in smoke
[38:49] all right
[38:51] but yet now
[38:52] to come this away see we can pick up a
[38:54] lot of things
[38:56] but stand back there and just thinking
[38:57] by way of the prophet messenger because
[38:59] you and i can't go there
[39:01] i'd put that emphasis in there never
[39:02] service we don't go by our own doings
[39:05] this is not something brother dale
[39:06] thought of at least you gotta admit i'm
[39:08] reading what he said
[39:09] you might not like what he said but i
[39:11] mean you know i'm reading what he says
[39:13] all right now
[39:15] to do that then an attribute would be
[39:18] god's thoughts
[39:22] you say well then that would make us
[39:23] pre-existence brother dale
[39:27] i believe in pre-existence of eternal
[39:30] life
[39:33] i believe in pre-existence of god don't
[39:35] you
[39:36] i mean don't you believe in that at
[39:37] least pre-existence of god
[39:39] well then if i'm a part of god
[39:42] then i believe in a pre-existence but
[39:44] the only way to be a part of god is for
[39:46] me to receive the new birth
[39:51] we'll get to it when the morning starts
[39:52] saying together and see unto god shouted
[39:54] for joy of how it was back when the
[39:56] lambs were slain but that was only
[39:58] figuratively
[40:00] the lamb wasn't physically slain
[40:03] before the foundation of the world
[40:04] that's right
[40:07] come on we don't believe in
[40:08] pre-existence we believe in the truth of
[40:10] the gospel
[40:12] but believing it in the correct way
[40:17] now then
[40:18] let's try to get to the point i hope
[40:20] that'll bring you up to it
[40:23] so if god dwelt alone
[40:29] and we don't believe that we were with
[40:30] him like
[40:32] peoples
[40:34] you know
[40:36] but we're only with him or in him as
[40:40] attributes
[40:44] thoughts
[40:48] eternal
[40:51] now what did we get to it this afternoon
[40:52] when brother brown said god knew
[40:55] if he
[40:56] created me and you we would fall if he
[40:59] gave us a free morning agency
[41:06] he knew if we would have a free moral
[41:08] agency we'd fall
[41:10] well this ain't pulling nothing over on
[41:11] him
[41:12] and don't worry about it
[41:14] amen and to me what you talk about is
[41:17] saying was we back there
[41:20] if we're not following after him now
[41:22] then it's certain we wasn't back there
[41:26] because we're proving what we are now we
[41:28] are now displaying his attributes that's
[41:30] right that's right
[41:33] everybody wants to kick old thomas you
[41:35] know doubting thomas doubting thomas
[41:38] there's one thing about it when he got
[41:40] his hands in the nail prints he said i
[41:41] believe it
[41:43] the prophet said well sometimes we need
[41:45] just a little bit extra help to believe
[41:49] now but think about it
[41:54] when he dwelt alone
[41:58] we
[41:59] were part of being part of him
[42:03] the eternal life that we now have
[42:06] that we received when we got here by the
[42:08] new birth
[42:10] all right
[42:12] that eternal life
[42:15] was in god at the beginning
[42:17] amen
[42:21] and see
[42:22] then you know the only thing i asked the
[42:24] two soul people
[42:26] because you remember they had the two
[42:27] sold one come the devil one come from
[42:29] god and he had to be this it had to be
[42:30] that
[42:31] it dwelt on the seat a lot all right and
[42:34] i asked a simple question
[42:37] i i'm simple
[42:41] and i asked simple questions
[42:43] i said the new birth
[42:45] is it the birth of the word that we come
[42:47] into the world with
[42:49] that you say or is it the birth of the
[42:51] word we receive after we got here
[42:55] i said all i want to know
[42:57] never got an answer
[43:00] because if they said one i was standing
[43:02] on the other side i said i thought okay
[43:05] i'm not mean i'm just straight
[43:10] see which one was it what you were born
[43:12] with or what you
[43:13] which one is the birth
[43:15] because if you say it's the one you're
[43:17] born with then you don't need a preacher
[43:19] now you annihilated all of paul's
[43:21] writing that's true
[43:23] you see why they didn't want to answer
[43:25] they don't want to try to answer that
[43:26] because they knew what i'd say
[43:28] if it's a seed she was born with then
[43:30] you don't need a preacher
[43:32] right
[43:39] but if you got to have a preacher
[43:43] then there must be something about that
[43:45] seed we don't understand
[43:47] that we say we're born with
[43:49] all right so that's what we're trying to
[43:50] get to the point
[43:52] but i want to get this and then we'll
[43:53] start back downward into so let's go
[43:56] to go ahead
[43:58] with uh joel
[44:01] come excuse me job 38 brother just pull
[44:04] that up where we can read it
[44:06] because here's where we're going to go
[44:07] to
[44:09] job was asked a question
[44:12] where was you when this happened were
[44:14] you when that happened
[44:15] and you remember joe was a smart man he
[44:17] was the smartest in the world he was
[44:18] very intelligent very smart man
[44:21] and he kind of got a little bit uh if
[44:24] you'll go back and study prior to this
[44:26] and study what the prophet is saying
[44:27] about him he got just a little bit
[44:30] too high in his own thinking
[44:32] self-righteousness right
[44:34] and as he did see then god just took the
[44:36] plots right over and under him and said
[44:39] where was you
[44:43] i've done this i've done that i've done
[44:45] this i've done that i've done it can you
[44:46] tell me
[44:48] how that got done
[44:51] and old job he's sit down and
[44:55] he said but job i'm not going to leave
[44:56] you embarrassed
[45:00] i want to ask you a major question
[45:05] job where were you
[45:08] when the morning stars
[45:10] sang together
[45:12] and the sons of god shouted for joy
[45:19] job was finally given a great
[45:21] understanding yes
[45:25] one day god said
[45:27] stand up job i want to talk to you like
[45:28] a man
[45:33] he said i know my redeemer liveth
[45:40] he got his answer to the questions
[45:44] it would deal with a redeemer
[45:48] because if you stay where this is
[45:50] existence at
[45:51] you have no
[45:53] uh
[45:55] manifestation reality
[45:58] you have figuratively uh but nothing
[46:00] real
[46:02] in what you call tangibilities are
[46:04] points
[46:05] of talking about
[46:06] a redeemer
[46:08] we'll get to it in a minute where the
[46:09] prophet of god said the lamb slain
[46:12] before the foundation where he said that
[46:13] was figuratively in god's mind
[46:15] that was not a reality as far as god is
[46:18] concerned it was reality
[46:20] but it wasn't physical
[46:23] all right
[46:24] so job where were you when the morning
[46:26] started saying together and the sons of
[46:27] god shouted for joy
[46:29] now where were you joe
[46:32] he said you just hold on a little while
[46:34] and i'll speak to you and you'll see the
[46:36] redeemer coming and you'll understand
[46:38] why this
[46:39] was happening
[46:41] why those angels were singing and why
[46:42] they were doing him but what we're going
[46:44] to be dealing with for a little bit
[46:48] when did this take place
[46:51] that the morning stars sang together and
[46:53] the sons of god shouted for joy when did
[46:56] this take place
[46:58] where did it take place
[47:00] and who is it speaking of
[47:04] all right
[47:05] now
[47:06] so let's go real fast in reading
[47:10] until we get down to a point then we'll
[47:11] slow down go to number five brother
[47:15] anderson
[47:17] this is taken from
[47:19] called witnesses 1953 405
[47:22] paragraph 140.
[47:25] someone was talking the other day about
[47:27] that brother branham and ed or ask him
[47:29] said do you have a new kind of religion
[47:30] he said no sir i'm preaching to hope i'm
[47:33] preaching the oldest religion there ever
[47:36] was and the only one there is
[47:39] and got salvation in it all right
[47:42] now oldest religion
[47:45] you remember that was the part when
[47:47] they asked him some questions look
[47:50] he said it's older than the world
[47:54] now what does he say now
[47:56] where was you when i laid the foundation
[47:57] of the world when the morning started
[47:59] saying together and the sons of god
[48:00] shouted for joy
[48:02] millions of years before the foundation
[48:04] of the world
[48:09] when did this scene know the morning
[48:11] stars singing together son of god
[48:12] shouting for joy when did it take place
[48:18] millions of years go ahead to the next
[48:23] number six
[48:25] the ministry of christ 1953 607
[48:28] paragraph 43 e43
[48:30] talk about shouting something new well
[48:33] why it's the oldest religion in the
[48:34] world the shouting religion
[48:38] well thousands of years before the world
[48:40] was ever formed
[48:42] god asked job one day he said they
[48:45] didn't ask job before the world because
[48:47] you get his point
[48:48] all right god asked job one day said
[48:51] where was you when i laid the foundation
[48:52] of the world when the morning starts
[48:54] saying together and the sons of god
[48:55] shouted for joy
[48:57] talk about something new
[48:58] we just got a new case of the old kind
[49:01] of kind that's all certainly shouting
[49:04] for joy what a time
[49:06] all right
[49:08] going to the next
[49:12] this is taken christ of mr god revealed
[49:14] 63 728
[49:17] to my opinion the first thing that he
[49:18] made was angels now remember that for a
[49:20] minute we're getting down here
[49:22] we've got to drop back from there
[49:24] downward all right but we'll get to that
[49:26] statement
[49:28] and when they worship him made him god
[49:29] and he started from there
[49:32] that was before see when the angels
[49:35] began to worship him that was before
[49:37] there was even a molecule in the earth
[49:40] there was nothing it was all darkness
[49:42] there was nothing no sun
[49:45] nor no moon no stars no nothing then he
[49:48] was god
[49:49] and he asked job where was you when i
[49:51] laid the foundation of the world see
[49:53] when the morning stars sang together and
[49:55] the sons of god shouted for joy
[49:57] see where were you see that was way back
[50:02] before the earth all right
[50:04] back before anything come into being
[50:08] whatsoever
[50:09] all
[50:10] right now remember then and we'll get to
[50:13] an answer to one question
[50:17] who were these
[50:19] morning stars
[50:21] and listen don't get me lost on it and
[50:23] run your computers real fast on your
[50:25] head i do know a little bit about the
[50:27] morning stars and the cherubims and the
[50:29] things and and i do know that you can
[50:32] bring it to the children of god of
[50:34] morning stars but i do know that's not
[50:35] what he's talking about here
[50:38] okay i just put that on our case people
[50:41] come and they say i don't have to listen
[50:43] to him he don't even understand well i
[50:45] just put it out the word now you ain't
[50:46] got nothing to argue with me about right
[50:49] so that was before there was even a
[50:50] molecule in the earth there was no sun
[50:52] it was nothing it was back before the
[50:54] foundation world
[50:55] who are these
[50:57] now we'll answer the question because he
[50:58] said the first thing that was made
[51:02] was angels
[51:05] now i'm going to catch you in just a
[51:06] second because
[51:08] we're going to go over and then fall
[51:10] backward okay
[51:12] so now listen real careful stay awake
[51:15] and do the point
[51:17] so he's saying these were angels let's
[51:19] see what he says go on down just make
[51:20] sure we answer it with the prophet
[51:23] why we are not a denomination 1958
[51:28] 927
[51:31] and then before there was one speck of
[51:33] life on the earth
[51:34] our bodies was laying here
[51:38] before there's any speck of light on the
[51:39] earth i mean our bodies would let you
[51:40] where do you think our bodies come from
[51:43] let's come out of this earth okay come
[51:45] on before one drop of moisture ever come
[51:47] on the earth we were laying here when
[51:50] adam walked up and down in the garden i
[51:52] was laying here amen yes sir oh glory
[51:55] when the cherubims
[51:56] the morning stars sang together now
[52:00] he's telling you who these are
[52:03] of the morning stars
[52:05] their cherubims are angels
[52:09] all right now
[52:12] morning stars standing together and the
[52:14] sons of god shouted for joy
[52:16] i was laying here just waiting for the
[52:18] breath of life to come i was here he
[52:20] made me hear i had my body laying here
[52:23] you see how positive brother brown can
[52:24] talk
[52:26] and then when he says you always was
[52:27] eternal what's he talking about
[52:30] he can talk about your body laying in
[52:31] the earth whenever we're first created
[52:34] and that's true
[52:36] they didn't a little bitty drop of mars
[52:38] come flying down through the sky and
[52:40] drop down on earth and your body come
[52:41] from that that's right
[52:43] because you just remember mars venus and
[52:45] all of that at one time was one thing
[52:47] together and then it blasted out
[52:50] all right see
[52:52] but see just talk about your body that's
[52:54] laying here
[52:55] but that's not eternal
[52:59] right that's not eternal
[53:02] going to the next one number nine
[53:05] which is paragraph 283 that was to our
[53:07] paragraph 241
[53:08] and one we're not a denomination the
[53:10] morning stars saying together the sons
[53:12] of god shouted for joy before there was
[53:13] a foundation in the world see before
[53:15] there was a foundation and then my
[53:17] angels and everything was happy shouting
[53:19] about it before there was a foundation
[53:22] of the world
[53:23] how is the ever devil going to keep you
[53:25] in the dust of the earth you just can't
[53:28] do it
[53:30] okay look on to the next one
[53:43] the first time angels
[53:46] this is taken from white had to be
[53:47] shepherds 1964 12 21. i give that
[53:50] because some people out there can't pick
[53:52] it up on the screen
[53:54] and some people are just listening so
[53:56] they don't get
[53:58] the first time angels ever sang at a
[54:00] celebration it was in heaven
[54:03] so now where is this event
[54:06] taking place
[54:08] we've answered that the cherubims as
[54:11] angels
[54:13] the morning stars sang together as
[54:15] angels
[54:16] all right
[54:17] now we're answering the question what it
[54:20] was in heaven
[54:23] all right
[54:25] and if you look in job
[54:27] 38 7 as i said as i see some of you
[54:30] taking notes when god first planned on
[54:32] making his first creation here joe was a
[54:35] great smart man he was kindred smart you
[54:37] know but what was he
[54:40] the first time i angels you run it on
[54:42] down to paragraph 94 and you'll see the
[54:44] first time angels that were saying
[54:46] celebration was in heaven
[54:50] now
[54:56] that answers the
[54:58] where it was at it's in heaven
[55:01] it answers
[55:03] who the
[55:04] morning stars are
[55:06] now let's answer the other one while
[55:08] we're on it look at number 11 the
[55:10] serpent seed paragraph 1
[55:14] 1958 928
[55:17] where was you when i laid he asked job
[55:19] when i laid the foundation of the earth
[55:20] when the morning stars sang together and
[55:22] the sons of god shouted for joy who were
[55:25] those sons of god that were shouting for
[55:27] joy
[55:28] and he said who were they now he answers
[55:30] it
[55:31] jesus told them
[55:33] that now who'd he tell
[55:36] he told the disciples yes
[55:40] right
[55:42] jesus told them that i had joy with you
[55:44] before the foundation of the world
[55:47] we're not creatures of time
[55:50] we're creatures of eternity
[55:52] and no man can come to me except my
[55:54] father draws him
[55:56] all right listen
[55:59] so these
[56:00] sons of god shouting for joy is he told
[56:03] the disciples that he knew him i gave
[56:05] you a quote just the other day on that
[56:08] all right so we've answered the
[56:09] questions
[56:11] where did this take place in heaven
[56:16] when did it take place
[56:20] back in eternity
[56:24] who were the morning stars angels
[56:28] now who are the
[56:30] sons of god shouting for joy
[56:33] is you and i
[56:35] if it was disciples it means us right
[56:38] but us with eternal life yes
[56:41] all right
[56:42] so now the answers to all of the
[56:44] questions has come into being
[56:47] so we can talk about
[56:49] something else then we go a little
[56:50] further look at the next one spiritual
[56:52] amnesia 1964 411
[56:56] paragraph 98. 89 excuse me notice he is
[57:00] in me and i in him notice then every
[57:03] christian that's a genuine christian
[57:05] christian was with him
[57:07] when the morning star sang together and
[57:09] the sons of god shouted for
[57:10] joy all christians
[57:13] was with him all right
[57:15] we were identified in the immortal
[57:18] realms with god
[57:22] 10 million years before the world was
[57:25] ever formed
[57:26] i was back there with him
[57:29] if
[57:30] i got eternal life
[57:34] i was there with him
[57:36] i was identified with him when the
[57:38] morning stars sang together the sons of
[57:40] god shouted for joy so
[57:42] number two so you can see where we're at
[57:43] all right
[57:44] i like to prove things as i go along
[57:46] then you don't have a
[57:47] right of argument
[57:49] were we
[57:52] were we spirits back then brother
[57:54] branham
[57:57] 1959 6 28 questions and answers
[58:00] target 169 were we spirits then no we
[58:04] were not even nothing then
[58:06] but in god's mind we were
[58:08] and he spoke it and it materialized
[58:12] okay
[58:14] and when he saw me
[58:16] he saw you
[58:17] before the foundation of the world we
[58:19] were only figurative
[58:22] in his mind
[58:26] right
[58:27] only figurative
[58:29] in his mind
[58:31] but get the foundation
[58:33] jesus was slain before
[58:35] how many knows that the bible teaches
[58:36] that jesus was the lamb slain before the
[58:38] foundation of the world
[58:41] well god spoke it and when he spoke it
[58:43] was good it's finished
[58:45] and when he saw me and he saw you before
[58:46] the foundation of the world we were only
[58:48] figurative
[58:50] figurative means what
[58:55] you were only figurative what does the
[58:57] word figurative mean
[58:58] it means a resemblance or a figure
[59:01] we were not back there in him as people
[59:08] amen right right
[59:11] we were not spirits
[59:13] no we was in his mind
[59:16] so now this place in heaven that we're
[59:18] talking about and this scene that we're
[59:20] talking about now we conclude one thing
[59:25] it was in his mind
[59:31] are you listening
[59:33] amen we've established it in heaven and
[59:35] way before the world now we're
[59:37] establishing one fact
[59:39] this was in his mind
[59:42] not reality
[59:45] far as god is concerned yes
[59:49] but it was in his mind
[59:52] before the world
[59:54] all right
[59:57] look at 13 a
[59:59] waters of separation
[1:00:01] 56
[1:00:02] 121 paragraph eleven
[1:00:05] now the separation christ was the lamb
[1:00:07] of god slain from the foundation of the
[1:00:09] world you believe that
[1:00:11] you believe christ was the lamb's flame
[1:00:12] that's revelation what 13 8
[1:00:15] the lamb's flame before the foundation
[1:00:17] world was that real
[1:00:19] notice always he was the lamb slain
[1:00:22] figuratively
[1:00:24] what's he saying
[1:00:28] jesus christ never died physically
[1:00:30] before the world
[1:00:31] you and i were not physically for the
[1:00:33] world so get it out of your mind us back
[1:00:35] our shouting
[1:00:36] in some physical form
[1:00:38] this is still in his mind
[1:00:43] this was not a physical happening
[1:00:50] okay
[1:00:52] you need another one with it
[1:00:55] e16 the power of god preaching 56 10 06
[1:00:58] in the evening
[1:01:00] no one could tell him anything about it
[1:01:03] but he by faith he's seen the son of god
[1:01:05] coming and offered a lamb and a
[1:01:07] figurative type
[1:01:10] all right
[1:01:11] seeing that jesus was the lamb slain
[1:01:13] from the foundation of the world god
[1:01:15] testified that's the truth god will
[1:01:17] always testify the truth but where was
[1:01:19] it was it in physical or what was it
[1:01:22] it was figurative means like a
[1:01:24] resemblance
[1:01:27] the word figurative means it's not real
[1:01:29] you know as far as we call real what we
[1:01:31] call realism
[1:01:32] tangibilities flesh blood you know what
[1:01:35] etc
[1:01:36] he was in his mind
[1:01:39] now let's prove that
[1:01:41] let's prove this scene that we're
[1:01:43] talking about the morning stars singing
[1:01:44] together sons of god shouting for joy
[1:01:49] now i'm going to say this and so you
[1:01:51] listen real careful
[1:01:52] this was before any angel was created
[1:02:03] but they can't sign
[1:02:13] you got to get angels first
[1:02:17] that's when we start downward
[1:02:22] this is in god's mind okay go ahead and
[1:02:24] let's read it
[1:02:25] uh
[1:02:27] go to number 14
[1:02:29] which is the serpent seed
[1:02:32] all right
[1:02:34] and as we thought in the blessed word
[1:02:36] that we had fellowship with him for the
[1:02:38] foundational world
[1:02:39] when the morning started saying together
[1:02:40] the sons of god shouted for joy way back
[1:02:42] for the foundation of the world
[1:02:44] how do we know that that wasn't at the
[1:02:46] same time that the lamb was slain
[1:02:50] that when god in his great thinking
[1:02:56] seen us shouting
[1:02:58] and rejoicing in our salvation through
[1:03:02] jesus
[1:03:07] amen
[1:03:08] it's only in his thinking
[1:03:11] yes
[1:03:13] sons of god shout at morning stars
[1:03:15] singing son of god shout out yeah but it
[1:03:17] hasn't come into being yet that's right
[1:03:23] but you better hold some little points i
[1:03:25] hope i can do it
[1:03:27] you better hold on just a little bit
[1:03:28] from here on a couple of words
[1:03:33] so now when did this take place
[1:03:36] how do we know that wasn't the same time
[1:03:38] that the lamb was flying
[1:03:44] and when god in his great thinking
[1:03:47] seeing us shouting and rejoicing in our
[1:03:49] salvation through jesus
[1:03:52] it's in his mind
[1:03:57] right
[1:04:00] hang on just a minute now i've got a
[1:04:01] little bit more to go with this okay
[1:04:02] some unwritten pages come on okay
[1:04:05] most of you know when i say unwritten i
[1:04:07] don't like to write down something
[1:04:11] look what he says on adoption
[1:04:14] 1965 18 paragraph 151
[1:04:18] he said being displayed in the prodigal
[1:04:20] son this is my son was lost and found
[1:04:22] he's dead and he's alive again bring
[1:04:24] forth a fatted calf know what no wonder
[1:04:26] when the morning stars signed together
[1:04:29] and the sons of god shouted for joy
[1:04:35] open your eyes and read that
[1:04:43] when they sing
[1:04:45] the plan of salvation
[1:04:55] evidently according to the prophet
[1:04:57] there was somewhere the bride of christ
[1:04:59] saw the plan of salvation
[1:05:06] okay god put your name on the book
[1:05:09] before the foundation of the world
[1:05:14] no wonder the morning starts saying
[1:05:16] again the son of god shouted for joy
[1:05:18] when they seen the plan of salvation
[1:05:24] look at the last one we'll be reading
[1:05:27] the rejected king 65 515 paragraph 57
[1:05:31] just rolled it on down to the bottom
[1:05:34] he's talking about the oldest religion
[1:05:36] he was at the hospital you know and he
[1:05:39] was getting ready i think this is the
[1:05:40] one getting ready to go overseas
[1:05:43] and uh you know
[1:05:44] and he was there in the hospital and i
[1:05:47] always bring this now because it's
[1:05:48] comical to me
[1:05:50] you know
[1:05:51] i'm kind of relaxing you a second before
[1:05:53] i start talking
[1:05:54] uh
[1:05:57] how many of you would like uh
[1:05:59] uh gail how would you like it that
[1:06:01] brother dick would be laying up in the
[1:06:03] hospital
[1:06:05] you know you know
[1:06:06] and you come walking in
[1:06:09] you know there's nobody in the room but
[1:06:11] him is him and this
[1:06:13] nurse
[1:06:16] and she's a young girl cause right
[1:06:17] around said she was
[1:06:19] and she's up there massaging brother
[1:06:21] dick's back
[1:06:24] feels better
[1:06:25] right you answered cause you're old
[1:06:29] she said cause she'd want one of them to
[1:06:31] joyce what would you say some of you
[1:06:33] young ones what would you say get your
[1:06:35] hand off my husband
[1:06:38] right
[1:06:39] brother brandon was laying there letting
[1:06:40] this girl massage his back
[1:06:44] those old days
[1:06:46] that's before people got to thinking
[1:06:48] about all of the things you know
[1:06:50] and it'd become all the bad things
[1:06:52] you know
[1:06:54] right
[1:06:55] that's back in the old days
[1:06:57] but she was talking to him about
[1:06:58] religion which one was you know
[1:07:00] is that is that a new one
[1:07:02] he said no ma'am
[1:07:05] he talked about her religion said that
[1:07:06] only about 200 years ago that
[1:07:08] organization but this organization
[1:07:10] started when the morning stars sang
[1:07:12] together the sons of god shouted for joy
[1:07:15] when they seen the coming of a savior
[1:07:19] to redeem mankind
[1:07:22] okay
[1:07:26] what about that
[1:07:28] what do you think about it
[1:07:30] we prove that this scene is in heaven
[1:07:32] we've proved who they are
[1:07:34] the angels can prove to the
[1:07:37] sons of god it's the bride of jesus
[1:07:39] christ
[1:07:41] is taking place in heaven it was in
[1:07:42] god's thinking
[1:07:46] now
[1:07:48] what do you think about it
[1:07:51] i don't believe we were back there in
[1:07:53] any form other than being a part of god
[1:07:57] okay
[1:07:59] this is not a physical taking place it
[1:08:02] was only figurative
[1:08:04] in god's mind
[1:08:07] all right
[1:08:09] so it must have been god's thinking
[1:08:12] of what would be
[1:08:15] and not what it was right there
[1:08:18] would you agree
[1:08:20] yes
[1:08:22] it would have to be what he was thinking
[1:08:24] that would take place
[1:08:27] because now see we're going to drop back
[1:08:28] down and start this afternoon to that
[1:08:30] foreknowledge
[1:08:33] we're dropping right back into full
[1:08:34] knowledge
[1:08:39] so god in his great thinking could see
[1:08:41] us shouting for joy and see the angels
[1:08:45] that would finally be created
[1:08:48] and that you and i would finally come
[1:08:49] into being but he could see it in his
[1:08:51] mind
[1:08:55] but notice
[1:09:01] it says we read there that these sons of
[1:09:03] god
[1:09:04] would see the plan of salvation
[1:09:08] we're not lost yet
[1:09:12] right
[1:09:15] there's nothing lost yet
[1:09:21] but the prophet said
[1:09:24] the sons of god seen the plan of
[1:09:26] salvation
[1:09:30] all right
[1:09:32] he says they've seen the coming of a
[1:09:35] redeemer
[1:09:37] to bring forth the plan of redemption
[1:09:45] but they never experienced this back
[1:09:46] there
[1:09:52] are you going to put people back there
[1:09:53] when you start doing that
[1:09:56] and may i illustrate it paul one day he
[1:09:58] stood there
[1:09:59] and he says
[1:10:01] brother brown said it this way he said
[1:10:02] get it out of your mind that the lord is
[1:10:04] coming right now
[1:10:05] he said because there's got to be a
[1:10:06] falling away
[1:10:08] the man of sin has got to come
[1:10:12] paul could look all the way down and see
[1:10:13] our day and see when it would command
[1:10:15] the man of sin
[1:10:16] he could not only look that he could
[1:10:18] look by the spirit of god
[1:10:20] forward into the future from where he
[1:10:22] was two thousand years and he could say
[1:10:25] that the lord himself shall descend from
[1:10:27] heaven with a shout
[1:10:28] voice over and archangel on the trump of
[1:10:30] god
[1:10:33] but to paul that wasn't real
[1:10:36] because he never experienced it
[1:10:38] he had to die and go by the grave
[1:10:41] he's waiting on you and i
[1:10:43] to catch this plan of salvation
[1:10:47] now
[1:10:50] even though on
[1:10:52] calvary he said it is finished
[1:10:56] and even though the holy ghost fell on
[1:10:57] the day of pentecost
[1:10:59] the complete plan of redemption
[1:11:02] was not made known back there
[1:11:07] if it was what are we doing
[1:11:11] the complete plan of salvation
[1:11:14] the saving of the soul sure the speaking
[1:11:16] of prophecy but it's changed in a moment
[1:11:18] a twinkling of an eye
[1:11:21] paul could speak of that about the
[1:11:22] future in the spirit
[1:11:27] but yet it was not in a reality
[1:11:36] all right now we maybe need to get into
[1:11:38] something that i've tried to explain
[1:11:42] i've spoke for quite a while about us
[1:11:44] being the children of god
[1:11:48] and being his offspring
[1:11:50] and being a part of him
[1:11:52] and being a part of his own life
[1:11:55] and by the new birth receiving that
[1:11:57] eternal life
[1:11:59] into our soul to make our soul eternal
[1:12:02] amen
[1:12:07] now
[1:12:14] god knew
[1:12:17] that when he created man he was going to
[1:12:19] fall we'll start there this afternoon
[1:12:22] he knew that
[1:12:23] he knew all he had to do was put him on
[1:12:25] free moral agency
[1:12:29] that was ease problem she had a choice
[1:12:32] she made the wrong choice
[1:12:34] adam just as bad because he made the
[1:12:36] choice to go with her so that's three
[1:12:38] more agency
[1:12:39] all right
[1:12:42] but to see a redeemer
[1:12:44] to come with the plan of salvation
[1:12:54] in the mind of god back there
[1:12:58] we saw
[1:13:01] the complete plan i'm talking about we
[1:13:05] the bride
[1:13:07] those with eternal life
[1:13:09] that eternal life in you was a part of
[1:13:10] god at that time
[1:13:14] and by being a part of god at that time
[1:13:21] then
[1:13:22] this is no mystery to us
[1:13:26] sure it had to be revealed to us
[1:13:29] but is it a
[1:13:30] mystery no it's no longer a mystery
[1:13:34] it's been revealed
[1:13:36] we understand the complete plan of
[1:13:38] redemption right body spirit world oh
[1:13:42] they didn't have that back there at
[1:13:43] calvary
[1:13:45] it was there he redeemed all
[1:13:48] but he couldn't make it manifest
[1:13:51] the jews was redeemed at calvary but not
[1:13:53] applied am i quoting the prophet
[1:14:01] it means a lot to be a part of god
[1:14:04] amen
[1:14:05] amen
[1:14:06] now remember the setting i've made
[1:14:09] everybody understand
[1:14:11] this scene
[1:14:14] was back before the world it was in
[1:14:15] heaven
[1:14:17] it was in god's thinking it was not a
[1:14:19] reality
[1:14:23] jesus christ never died in a reality
[1:14:25] back there
[1:14:30] he died in the figurative
[1:14:32] in other words
[1:14:34] one day he would have to die
[1:14:39] all right
[1:14:40] so then god could start this away
[1:14:44] to come be down
[1:14:46] and the first thing he would create was
[1:14:48] angels
[1:14:52] and they would worship him yes
[1:14:57] you go there
[1:14:58] he became god we go to genesis 1. we'll
[1:15:00] start there this afternoon
[1:15:07] but
[1:15:09] show me where he ever created his
[1:15:11] children
[1:15:19] you didn't listen while ago
[1:15:21] he was amen and then
[1:15:23] let's see if you amen
[1:15:28] the only way god can be a creation is in
[1:15:30] christ jesus
[1:15:32] that's quoting brother branham amen
[1:15:38] he's the beginning of the creation of
[1:15:39] god and the prophet of god said we are
[1:15:41] the continuation of that creation now
[1:15:43] how is he the beginning of the creation
[1:15:44] of god oh i know all of it goes down to
[1:15:46] a baby being born and coming up i agree
[1:15:51] but you're not listening to word when he
[1:15:52] started before the world
[1:15:57] and that beginning of the creation of
[1:15:58] god was that logos that went out of god
[1:16:00] in the beginning
[1:16:02] that stood there and said let there be
[1:16:05] if you and i have eternal life we was
[1:16:06] right there with him sister gail when he
[1:16:08] said let there be
[1:16:13] in him right there when he said let
[1:16:15] there be
[1:16:18] i didn't say with him
[1:16:23] because we hadn't come forth yet
[1:16:25] would you show me where he ever created
[1:16:27] his people
[1:16:29] his children are not created they're
[1:16:31] born
[1:16:37] the birth
[1:16:38] which means they're coming forth into
[1:16:44] we'll get down to where the prophetess
[1:16:46] god said you didn't become seed by the
[1:16:48] new birth he said well you're already
[1:16:50] seek that's why you could be born again
[1:16:51] because only in the seed can be born
[1:16:53] because in non-seed there's nothing to
[1:16:55] quicken
[1:16:56] come on we've got a long ways to go
[1:16:59] we got a big message
[1:17:02] do you understand yes
[1:17:07] so in the mind of god
[1:17:12] he knew he was going to create angels
[1:17:14] amen
[1:17:16] and he knew if they'd seen the plan of
[1:17:18] salvation coming forth they'd shout
[1:17:21] but he really knew
[1:17:23] that he was going to bring his children
[1:17:24] into being
[1:17:28] and when his children would come forth
[1:17:36] do you not shout
[1:17:39] in your own maybe not physically and
[1:17:41] running and screaming and hollering but
[1:17:45] what about the day you received jesus
[1:17:47] christ as your savior
[1:17:52] wouldn't that a shout in time
[1:17:54] according to the bible
[1:17:57] the angels in heaven
[1:17:59] rejoice
[1:18:02] over one sinner that comes to salvation
[1:18:04] amen so they shout
[1:18:06] that's right
[1:18:10] they sing
[1:18:12] yes but they can't sing the song of
[1:18:14] redemption
[1:18:15] because they're not redeemed
[1:18:18] if you and i
[1:18:21] you say well what are you talking about
[1:18:23] see if we
[1:18:25] the eternal life that we have you have
[1:18:27] to agree that irregardless what your
[1:18:29] doctrine is you would have to agree that
[1:18:31] we have eternal life
[1:18:33] by the new birth
[1:18:35] if you say we come in the world with
[1:18:36] eternal life you're still going to have
[1:18:37] to agree it's eternal life that's right
[1:18:39] i mean don't make no difference if you
[1:18:41] come in the world eternal son then you
[1:18:43] go ahead with it you just believe what
[1:18:44] you're going to believe but just
[1:18:45] remember one time
[1:18:47] that's what i'm saying i'm not trying to
[1:18:48] correct doctrine or preach i'm trying to
[1:18:50] give real truth to understand yes
[1:18:53] even if i believe i come into this world
[1:18:55] he's eternal as god is physically body
[1:18:57] spirit and soul i'd still want this one
[1:18:59] point in mind
[1:19:04] that when i was a part of god
[1:19:06] before the world ever begun
[1:19:09] when i was in his thinking
[1:19:11] i was a part of him
[1:19:16] and it's not jehovah witness
[1:19:19] jehovah witness said we were all up in
[1:19:21] heaven excuse me mormon we were all up
[1:19:23] in heaven
[1:19:25] and we decided to come to earth to be
[1:19:27] lost where father could come and save us
[1:19:29] no
[1:19:31] but the eternal life that i have in me
[1:19:33] today knew before this world
[1:19:38] where i would be this day
[1:19:42] the prophet said look how that little
[1:19:43] thing worked itself out
[1:19:47] that he had to breed this one to that
[1:19:49] one to this one to that one even to get
[1:19:50] your body here amen amen
[1:19:53] he said that's even natural is
[1:19:55] predestinated yes
[1:19:57] yes
[1:20:00] what are you trying to say
[1:20:02] i'm trying to say one thing when the
[1:20:04] morning stars staying together and the
[1:20:05] sons of god shouted for joy
[1:20:07] it was in god's mind before the world
[1:20:09] ever begun but it was in god's mind to
[1:20:11] know what would take place when we got
[1:20:13] here
[1:20:15] and that way i can
[1:20:16] shout about my salvation
[1:20:20] and i can shout about knowing now not
[1:20:21] just a part of a plan of redemption
[1:20:24] not having to worry like we did down to
[1:20:26] the times until this prophet came you
[1:20:28] know what i'm talking about we all
[1:20:29] worried about where was going to get us
[1:20:31] a new body or where he was going to get
[1:20:32] there so we're going to get that yes
[1:20:36] until the prophet come into view with
[1:20:37] the word
[1:20:45] shouting for joy
[1:20:46] you mean you can't shout now
[1:20:51] and you wouldn't in god's mind shouting
[1:20:53] then
[1:20:55] is that plain enough amen come on
[1:20:57] musician
[1:20:58] is that enough
[1:21:00] if we can't shout and rejoice now
[1:21:04] you know why those angels
[1:21:08] are singing when a bird when a when a
[1:21:11] person is a born again christian
[1:21:15] the bible says that they are
[1:21:18] angels that are
[1:21:21] ministers of
[1:21:23] salvation
[1:21:25] to come to you and i
[1:21:27] and the day you was born again
[1:21:29] you receive an angel
[1:21:32] amen that's your protective guardian
[1:21:35] angel
[1:21:36] to guide you into the truth
[1:21:40] as it was in the garden he had they had
[1:21:42] to drive them out of the garden because
[1:21:43] of the sin those angels champions drove
[1:21:46] them out
[1:21:47] but now he's driving us back to the tree
[1:21:49] of life
[1:21:51] the day you were born again your prophet
[1:21:52] of god said god gave you an angel that
[1:21:54] angel knows what his job is
[1:21:57] he's one thing to take care of you to
[1:21:59] keep you from getting killed because the
[1:22:00] devil wants to get you that's right
[1:22:03] the minute you become a born-again
[1:22:04] christian the devil turns everything
[1:22:06] he's got on you
[1:22:08] he wants to kill you yeah but you got an
[1:22:10] angel to make sure it don't work amen
[1:22:13] you got an angel to lead you to
[1:22:14] salvation
[1:22:17] in the odd we talk a lot about angels
[1:22:20] in the nod we believe in a seven church
[1:22:22] age messenger as an angel they come to
[1:22:24] bring us a message
[1:22:28] a message of redemption
[1:22:32] why can't we shout church
[1:22:38] why can't we sing
[1:22:40] and worship and believe him
[1:22:42] yes
[1:22:43] to see what he's done for you and i
[1:22:47] if you understand what i'm saying i'm
[1:22:48] gonna say it one more time just get on
[1:22:50] with it
[1:22:52] if you have eternal life
[1:22:55] then that life was in god when the
[1:22:57] what that where the morning stars
[1:23:01] he saw that angels would be singing
[1:23:04] but we knew the plan of salvation yes
[1:23:09] you said we we knew it back there
[1:23:11] the prophet says we don't remember
[1:23:14] right
[1:23:17] right
[1:23:19] it's not napoleon i feel like i was back
[1:23:22] there
[1:23:24] stupidity
[1:23:26] i'm talking about those who have
[1:23:28] received eternal life by the new birth
[1:23:31] are now the offspring of god the
[1:23:33] children of god make manifest on earth
[1:23:35] and why can't we shout
[1:23:37] amen and have a good time in our
[1:23:39] salvation yes
