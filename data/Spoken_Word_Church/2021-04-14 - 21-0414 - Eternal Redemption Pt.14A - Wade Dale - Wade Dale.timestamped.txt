[2:03] hey man good to be in the house with the
[2:04] lord
[2:06] good to be here on a good wednesday
[2:08] night
[2:10] we uh you know i was thinking today we
[2:15] it's a sad time but it's a glorious time
[2:17] and
[2:19] i found this quote i want to read it to
[2:21] you for
[2:24] you know brother brown i tried to find
[2:26] the quote maybe somebody can find it
[2:29] where brother brian said somebody you
[2:30] know will meet you across the river
[2:33] because you've never been that way
[2:34] before and it's a dark place listen to
[2:36] this
[2:37] 1950 brother brown life story said one
[2:39] morning the doctor will probably leave
[2:41] the room saying there's nothing else can
[2:42] be done
[2:44] loved ones will be standing and ringing
[2:46] their hands crying
[2:48] the cold vapors of death floating over
[2:50] the bedside
[2:52] cold chilly winds of death sweeping
[2:54] their pulse coming up your sleeve
[2:57] then breaking through the mist will come
[2:59] that old ship of zion
[3:03] the morning star will come down in the
[3:04] valley of death and light it up
[3:09] they'll see two glossy wings of the holy
[3:12] ghost reach across the jordan
[3:14] and say come on you blessed of my father
[3:18] i seen you that day in that little old
[3:20] tent meeting down there in cleveland
[3:22] tennessee cleveland ohio when you came
[3:25] and you accepted me
[3:26] said now i'm accepting you that makes
[3:32] feel good
[3:34] oh yeah there's a big question mark but
[3:37] to have the morning star come down to
[3:38] the valley of death and
[3:40] light it up for you the bible says in
[3:43] psalms 116 it says precious in the sight
[3:46] of the lord is the death of his saints
[3:48] we get it but we get it so backwards
[3:50] because we
[3:52] we cry to death and we we
[3:55] rejoice at a birth but the bible tells
[3:56] us in ecclesiastes 7 1 says a good name
[3:59] is better than precious ointment
[4:01] and the day of death than the day of
[4:03] one's
[4:04] birth so we get it kind of backwards so
[4:10] we're sad for the family we know that's
[4:11] for sure
[4:13] but we know one thing's for sure
[4:16] i'll promise you he got met on the river
[4:21] brother dick was standing right there
[4:24] because brother dick died about a year
[4:25] ago
[4:26] he was standing right there he said come
[4:28] on brother ray
[4:30] i know where to go you know brother dick
[4:32] he doesn't scope to everything out
[4:34] probably he said couldn't find no
[4:35] chick-fil-a over here but uh
[4:38] but he said come on brother ray i know
[4:39] what to do he said brother tatum met me
[4:43] then you just keep going down the string
[4:45] of the different ones that met you and
[4:47] on this side that you'll meet on the
[4:49] other side because as i was reading
[4:51] before and i think i may read it again
[4:53] today where
[4:54] brother brown says your your spirit is
[4:57] familiar there
[4:58] it's not familiar in the fifth dimension
[5:00] listen our our soul is not even familiar
[5:02] with this down here
[5:04] amen that's why we're striving to get
[5:07] there or bring them here so we can go in
[5:09] a rapture and we can take a
[5:11] a flight over into another dimension and
[5:13] then you know what they're going to
[5:14] continue to beat each other up on this
[5:16] side
[5:17] until we come back in the millennium but
[5:19] i thought those
[5:20] that was a wonderful quote he said the
[5:22] two glossy wings of the holy spirit will
[5:23] reach
[5:24] across jordan if you don't have the holy
[5:26] ghost though
[5:27] none of that will happen right you'll be
[5:30] thrown over in the dungeon of the fifth
[5:32] dimension and they ain't gonna
[5:34] ain't nobody gonna be there to care how
[5:37] you feel but boy
[5:39] before the foundation of the world god
[5:41] set this plan
[5:42] up that when the saint did go home
[5:46] he had everything prepared and ready for
[5:47] him so thank god for that
[5:49] amen that's the god we serve that's not
[5:52] a god that says oops i'm sorry you're in
[5:54] the wrong place or
[5:55] no he knew exactly what day he knew
[5:57] exactly what hour
[5:58] he knew exactly what time he that
[6:00] brother ray needed to go home
[6:02] he was his journey was done it was
[6:04] finished
[6:05] and he didn't need to be here anymore
[6:07] because god saw that he was finished
[6:09] but we do pray for the family
[6:12] of brother ray and also this sunday
[6:16] there will be a love offering taken for
[6:18] brother ray and his family
[6:20] um to help with some of the funeral

[9:11] knowing that
[9:13] that pew will be empty there along with
[9:14] brother dick
[9:16] right here up front lord and being
[9:19] wonderful cheerleaders but lord
[9:22] we've only lost him for a moment because
[9:24] you've got him over there on the other
[9:26] side
[9:26] that young man running down through the
[9:30] hills of glory through that sixth
[9:32] dimension
[9:34] praising god with all the other saints
[9:35] that are there waiting
[9:37] on us to come to a place father may we
[9:39] come to that place
[9:42] be with us and lead us and guide us by
[9:43] your holy spirit and may the day lord
[9:45] hasten
[9:46] that we are able to see them again lord
[9:50] not
[9:50] ever to be old again not ever to have an
[9:53] ache or a pain not have to worry about
[9:55] this that or the other
[9:56] but lord would just walk down through
[9:58] the streets of glory father for an
[9:59] eternity
[10:00] but lord we've got work to do on this
[10:02] side we've got to fight a battle
[10:04] we've got to take this kingdom by force
[10:07] you told us while you're here and we got
[10:09] to press the battle
[10:10] fight as hard as we can we'll lose a
[10:13] soldier here or there but we are
[10:15] already victorious we've already won the
[10:18] war we just got a few battles that we
[10:20] need to fight
[10:22] father forgive us of our sins bless this
[10:24] day lord you be the active participant
[10:26] in this service
[10:27] be the ones that are not here lord the
[10:29] ones that are sick you know who they are
[10:31] the ones that are sin sick father we
[10:33] pray that you speak to the heart today
[10:34] lord
[10:35] not a lot of time left father for us to
[10:37] be playing around lord we need to get in
[10:39] or get out
[10:40] father we ask you blessings in jesus
[10:42] name
[10:43] amen hebrews 9 verse 11 but christ being
[10:47] coming high priest of good things to
[10:48] come by a greater more perfect
[10:49] tabernacle
[10:51] not made with hands that is to say not
[10:53] of this building neither by the blood of
[10:55] goats and calves but by his own blood he
[10:56] entered in once
[10:58] into the holy place having obtained
[11:01] eternal redemption for us and let's read
[11:04] first john 4 this is where we're going
[11:05] to
[11:06] get to a little bit later
[11:11] and we have known now this is john
[11:13] little john's this is all john's already
[11:15] back from patmos
[11:16] he's already seen the antichrist he's
[11:18] already seen the bride taken up in the
[11:19] glory he's already seen the future home
[11:20] come down
[11:21] so they ain't nothing but love in this
[11:23] old man's heart he's probably in his 90s
[11:25] by now
[11:26] he's lived his life and listened to what
[11:28] he says
[11:29] and we have known and believed the love
[11:31] that god hath to us
[11:33] god is love he that dwelleth in love
[11:36] dwelleth in god and god in him
[11:39] herein is our love made perfect now now
[11:42] listen
[11:43] that has nothing to do with filial love
[11:45] that has nothing to do with the love you
[11:47] have on this earth
[11:49] nothing remember
[11:53] that love is the love of god that is
[11:55] agape love that is the baptism of the
[11:57] holy ghost that is the new birth
[12:00] in your soul that is loving god i'll
[12:03] read a quote here in a little while you
[12:04] can't love with this thing you can't
[12:05] love god with any of this
[12:07] amen all right hearing is our love made
[12:11] perfect that we may have boldness in the
[12:15] day of judgment because
[12:16] as he is so are we in this world
[12:20] who is the he jesus christ so heirs and
[12:22] joint heirs he overcame on this earth
[12:24] you and i
[12:24] he didn't overcome in heaven he overcome
[12:26] on earth
[12:28] amen sure he overcomes michael the
[12:30] prince but as jesus christ our savior
[12:32] our joint heir our our boaz he overcame
[12:35] down here
[12:36] amen for me and you there is no love no
[12:40] fear
[12:41] in love but perfect love casteth out
[12:45] fear
[12:45] because fear hath torment he that
[12:48] feareth is not made perfect in love
[12:53] we love him because he first loved us
[12:56] that's agape love that is not filial
[12:58] love
[12:59] if a man say i love god now watch and
[13:01] hateth his brother he is a liar
[13:05] that cuts it right there
[13:08] for he that loveth not his brother whom
[13:10] he hath seen
[13:12] how can he love god whom he hath not
[13:16] seen
[13:17] you may be seated in the lord at his
[13:18] blessing to the reading the word but
[13:20] we're going to continue in background
[13:22] just for some of the new ones
[13:23] some of the ones that have been here
[13:26] we're going to go back to
[13:27] and see that read ephesians 1 verse 1. i
[13:30] hope you're not getting tired of this
[13:32] because i'm going to read ephesians 1
[13:33] all day long and keep reading it all
[13:34] over again
[13:36] amen because of what is in it it's the
[13:37] eternal word of god
[13:39] and if you can't stand to read it then
[13:40] that spirit that you got in you ain't
[13:42] going to the other side
[13:43] well it may go the other side but it's
[13:44] not going where brother raised that
[13:46] right according as he has chosen us in
[13:49] him
[13:50] before the foundation of the world so
[13:53] now listen like i said before according
[13:55] to god's mind this thing is set
[13:59] dried and done it is predetermined
[14:03] but not that he pulled you through a
[14:04] tube he predetermined because he foresaw
[14:07] by foreknowledge and we're going to read
[14:08] that here in just a minute
[14:10] because the accordionist has chosen us
[14:11] in him before the foundation of the
[14:12] world
[14:13] what he saw us look he saw us
[14:17] holy and without blame
[14:20] before him in agape
[14:24] not filio amen
[14:27] right right here in in agape
[14:30] not in filio right
[14:34] a lot of love that we have for god that
[14:36] people in this world have for god
[14:38] is filial love
[14:41] because if they don't have the new birth
[14:43] they can't love god without the new
[14:44] birth
[14:46] you can't you love everything else but
[14:48] you cannot love god without the baptism
[14:50] of holy ghost you cannot love god
[14:52] you don't know how to that love is
[14:54] different
[14:55] than feeling your love because filio
[14:57] love will take you to lust which will
[14:59] take you
[14:59] you notice i was thinking about this
[15:01] yesterday
[15:04] and i think i was telling some of the
[15:05] brothers we look and we see people
[15:07] leaving the message and
[15:09] and we see people that are now
[15:11] condemning the message and we
[15:12] we see people that are questioning the
[15:14] message
[15:16] questioning questioning the message
[15:19] leaving the message
[15:21] i told the brothers and i hope you agree
[15:23] with me
[15:25] and i'm not i'm not raising this church
[15:28] up to any
[15:29] i'm just telling you what god's done
[15:30] when you have good solid teaching
[15:34] that will not sit in a congregation
[15:38] that thing will leave but now you can
[15:41] shout and you can love
[15:42] god with your whoo
[15:47] with your feelings and your emotions and
[15:50] you can be in love with him but what
[15:52] brother brown say you're doing you're
[15:53] actually in love
[15:54] with the devil
[15:58] am i right because the bible says he'll
[16:01] give them a strong delusion and let them
[16:03] believe a lie
[16:06] but you take any church and any preacher
[16:08] that's been a strong teacher and had a
[16:10] strong teaching ministry and had
[16:11] ministers that come in that have a good
[16:13] strong teaching ministry
[16:14] you don't see splits in the church you
[16:16] oh sure we got problems we're family
[16:22] but not the problems like others like
[16:24] questioning marriage and divorce
[16:26] questioning the seals questioning the
[16:28] daniel 70 weeks questioning whether the
[16:30] cloud was there or not there
[16:32] but with good solid teaching you can
[16:34] rest assured on one thing
[16:36] you've got agape love and that agape
[16:38] love is going to have to coincide with
[16:40] the word
[16:42] amen because feel your love will take
[16:44] you off
[16:45] every time why you look at and and you
[16:48] be careful i'm telling ministers too we
[16:50] need to all be careful
[16:51] why do brother brown say money women in
[16:54] popularity was the three things the
[16:55] minister had to watch out for
[16:57] money stimulation women
[17:00] and popularity now that has nothing to
[17:04] do with god
[17:06] right but you watch and be careful
[17:08] because you don't want to ever get
[17:10] yourself because you have an anointing
[17:12] on you ministers
[17:13] because that's what we're doing we're
[17:14] taking a female bride
[17:19] and we're making love to a female bride
[17:22] in spirituality
[17:24] bringing them to the head church i mean
[17:26] the head person the head of the church
[17:28] christ not to ourself to christ
[17:32] but if you don't if you have filial love
[17:34] instead of agape love
[17:36] where is it going to take you it's going
[17:38] to take you downward to that lust and
[17:40] then filth and all that that brother
[17:42] adam will talk about in a minute
[17:44] so be so be careful even with the holy
[17:46] ghost listen you can be deceived but
[17:48] listen you won't be to stay
[17:49] long if you're under a good teaching
[17:50] ministry or you hear a good teacher
[17:52] or you hear some a good sermon from
[17:55] somebody
[17:56] that strikes to your heart but if you
[17:58] just love with just regophilio love
[18:00] anything like brother dale says you
[18:01] you get him i told brother chris about
[18:03] this and he really eat a laugh
[18:05] brother dale said you get them in with a
[18:07] cheeseburger you can get them out with a
[18:08] hot dog in other words if you can gather
[18:10] people in and
[18:10] feed them and then the next guy can feed
[18:13] him and he'll they'll go to the next
[18:14] church you understand what i mean
[18:16] but if you'll feed them the sincere milk
[18:17] of the word to begin with and then you
[18:19] feed them some meat
[18:21] they'll either choke on it and leave
[18:24] or they'll learn to eat right brother
[18:27] louise where'd louise had he's in the
[18:28] back
[18:29] louise yep amen
[18:32] and right he'll he'll testify to that
[18:34] you just got to sit here long enough to
[18:35] be able to get some teeth so you can
[18:37] chew on it instead of choking on it
[18:38] amen but listen but this message the
[18:41] mandate of this message is not us to
[18:43] stay babies
[18:45] the reason we've been here 50 or 60
[18:47] years is is because there are so many
[18:48] questions
[18:49] there are so many babies there are so
[18:51] many milk drinkers
[18:52] people that need an emotion that needs
[18:54] somebody to shout that needs somebody
[18:56] they need they need
[18:57] needy people have filial love
[19:04] not agape love because you get
[19:05] everything you need from this word right
[19:07] here
[19:08] you get everything from the teaching of
[19:10] this word in a reading of your bible
[19:12] and doing your daily devotion that's
[19:14] where you get fed from
[19:17] i didn't know i was going this way but
[19:19] we're heading in that direction
[19:20] because feel your love listen feeling
[19:22] your love has to go backwards
[19:26] it can't go forward when you go from
[19:28] filial love when you get to agape love
[19:30] you you got to love god and you can't go
[19:31] back the other way
[19:32] that's right now that doesn't mean you
[19:34] can't love your wife and love your
[19:35] family and love
[19:36] but listen if they're not believers
[19:40] that's why the bible says two can't walk
[19:43] unless they agree agape love and feel
[19:46] your love will walk certain way
[19:48] but somewhere that's got to separate
[19:51] got to unless they both get agape love
[19:54] and then when you both get agape love
[19:56] then you can have agape love and
[19:57] superfilial love because you know how to
[20:00] love if you get the love of god
[20:02] see what i mean i'm gonna have ephesians
[20:04] and we're still preaching on something a
[20:05] little different
[20:06] i love ephesians but listen it's a
[20:08] requirement for us to study it's a
[20:10] requirement for us to know these things
[20:12] we've been around the message like i
[20:13] said before
[20:14] we got every message in a little piece
[20:15] like an mp3 player that you can put
[20:17] like in your pocket there's no excuse
[20:20] for you to not to listen there's no
[20:21] excuse for you not to listen to
[20:23] to archive messages and all the
[20:25] different things that that you're
[20:26] what you're privileged to have and not
[20:29] only here
[20:31] not really not only here
[20:34] but this is my home church so this is
[20:36] where i get that's where my roots are so
[20:37] this is where my tree gets fed
[20:39] amen having predestinated us into the
[20:42] adoption see we're
[20:44] we got to come to adoption speaking
[20:46] terms
[20:47] speaking where we can speak the prophet
[20:51] said and it will happen
[20:52] glory having predestinated us unto that
[20:55] he predestinated a group of people
[20:57] to come to adoption that god can use you
[21:00] that you can drive the car that you can
[21:02] even
[21:03] now you can as we're going to look at in
[21:04] just a minute if we get to it
[21:06] you can fly an airplane then now listen
[21:10] and we'll read it in just a minute but
[21:12] think about this think about how we
[21:14] should have
[21:15] we should have come up in this message
[21:18] of the hour
[21:19] horse and buggy oh yeah
[21:25] dad and i go to kentucky to preach for
[21:27] brother byler or some of them and
[21:28] they've got a huge amish
[21:30] um huge i mean they've even got a lane
[21:34] for the
[21:35] because you can see the results of the
[21:37] of the horses down the lane but they're
[21:39] i mean they're heading to church at 25
[21:41] miles an hour
[21:43] well they're still in that part but you
[21:44] know what we go buy them at 65 miles an
[21:46] hour and we get to church faster than
[21:48] they do
[21:49] but then guess what it's like i said
[21:52] about chuck yeager
[21:53] you go to an airplane it's different
[21:55] from driving a car you can't just get in
[21:56] an airplane and drive an airplane
[21:58] what a disaster but now you can drive a
[22:01] car
[22:03] right if you want to drive a race car if
[22:05] sterling was here you tell you you got
[22:06] to have a lot more coordination you got
[22:08] to have a lot
[22:08] quicker reflexes you got to have a lot
[22:10] because you're what you're running at a
[22:12] higher speed
[22:13] now what about an astronaut though so
[22:16] he's got this great big
[22:18] i think about the other day that big old
[22:19] seven whatever it was that i took to the
[22:21] philippines that thing was
[22:23] way bigger than this building with the
[22:25] wingspan and everything
[22:27] and i thought one man is driving that
[22:28] thing
[22:30] he's got the controls now there's other
[22:31] you know he's got a co-pilot and he's
[22:32] got an alligator
[22:33] but there's one dude up there with that
[22:35] stick in his hand
[22:36] he's got 400 people behind him with
[22:39] about 8
[22:40] 000 gallons of fuel two engines well
[22:43] that one had four or four inches you
[22:44] know what i'm saying
[22:45] but he wasn't nervous i hope
[22:48] well i got over there and back so he
[22:50] must have knew what he was talking about
[22:51] you know why because he had been trained
[22:54] because he said he said okay i'm going
[22:57] to be a pilot
[22:59] right so he took the required courses to
[23:03] be a pilot
[23:05] he was able to get into the seals he was
[23:08] able to get into the doctrines that
[23:10] we're supposed to be getting into
[23:11] because without the opening of the seals
[23:13] you're going to see without the opening
[23:14] of the seals you can't get this message
[23:18] sorry right you might get
[23:22] part but the full adoption has to be the
[23:25] open book it has to be the opening of
[23:27] the seals it has to be
[23:28] you understand that this seal means this
[23:31] and this seal means this
[23:32] but you take that guy flying that great
[23:34] big airplane but now look
[23:36] you wouldn't want to pick him up and
[23:37] just set him over into
[23:39] a a saturn rocket
[23:43] and say look go for it buddy same thing
[23:45] go fly
[23:47] uh-uh be a disaster what
[23:50] those pi those those astronauts sure
[23:52] they're they're pilots most of them are
[23:54] they start as pilots
[23:56] but when they become a pilot they got to
[23:58] take two or three more years training
[24:00] before they're an astronaut
[24:02] what am i saying we are in the astronaut
[24:04] age we're not in even the airplane age
[24:07] we're in the astronaut age we're
[24:08] supposed to be able to handle this
[24:10] 50 000 pound you know 200 feet tall
[24:14] rocket one person driving it that's the
[24:18] same way with the message of the hour we
[24:19] have no excuse
[24:21] we have no excuse to just sit here with
[24:23] that wilder bewildered look on our face
[24:32] maybe you ought to get a gothic love
[24:36] listen if you have agape love god will
[24:38] not allow you to just sit there
[24:41] and die
[24:44] if you have any effort at all he's got
[24:48] to respond to the word that's being
[24:50] preached
[24:52] but if you don't have agape love you've
[24:54] just got feeling all that well i just
[24:55] love to go to church they're just such
[24:56] good people
[24:57] that's all right that's got part to do
[24:59] with it but is there love of god there
[25:02] then the love of god is not just
[25:04] oh lovey-dovey i let's love everybody
[25:05] and i'll hug him and kiss him
[25:07] love is corrective
[25:11] love has to be strong love has to be
[25:14] love
[25:14] love has a judge involved
[25:18] hello somebody love has a judge involved
[25:21] a lot of times when we go into a natural
[25:23] courtroom
[25:24] you think they know love in that
[25:26] courtroom
[25:27] they're screaming and hollering at each
[25:29] other and calling each other names and
[25:30] the judge is just sitting there
[25:32] and he's got to decide which one's right
[25:34] we've got a righteous judge
[25:37] remember the prophet of god said how do
[25:39] we lose
[25:41] we walk into the courtroom the judge is
[25:43] our father
[25:45] the prosecuting attorney is our father
[25:49] the defense attorney's our father and
[25:52] the jury's our father
[25:54] how are we going to lose but that's if
[25:57] you got
[25:58] agape love not filial love
[26:02] god does not have to respond to filial
[26:04] love the devil can respond to filial
[26:06] love
[26:06] but you know what the devil can't
[26:08] respond to agape love because he don't
[26:09] know what it is
[26:11] that's why brother branham says he said
[26:14] he said
[26:14] you got satan's answer you've got
[26:18] something he cannot have
[26:19] he never can possess it he can imitate
[26:22] it to a degree
[26:23] but like i said before if you preach the
[26:25] word line by line
[26:27] word by word some emotion that's okay
[26:30] and some feeling that's okay but if you
[26:31] lay that word down word by word
[26:33] he cannot argue that
[26:37] oh yeah he can argue under filial love
[26:39] but he doesn't have any agape love to
[26:41] argue with
[26:43] if you argue then it's filio and agape
[26:45] and arguing with each other you know
[26:49] i wish people would see that
[26:53] get the holy ghost it'll change your
[26:56] life
[26:58] having predestinated us into the
[27:00] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[27:02] himself
[27:02] according to the good pleasure of his
[27:04] will to the praise of the glory of his
[27:06] grace wherein he hath made
[27:07] us accepted in the beloved
[27:11] that's agape love
[27:14] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[27:16] we're not to made us accepted in the
[27:17] beloved
[27:18] in whom we have redemption through his
[27:20] blood the forgiveness of sins
[27:23] according to the riches of his grace
[27:25] wherein he has abounded toward us he
[27:27] heats it on top of us in all wisdom and
[27:29] prudence
[27:31] i'll read to you in just a minute
[27:35] watch what is the mystery of his will
[27:37] brother dale's preaching on is to adopt
[27:39] us
[27:40] because they can't understand that now
[27:43] in the natural
[27:44] we have adoption in the natural
[27:47] which is a close type but in the jewish
[27:51] adoption which is called
[27:52] bar mitzvah it's the sun
[27:56] that's already born the sun so you gotta
[27:59] have the agape love because that puts
[28:01] you in the family
[28:02] all right so that's why you receive the
[28:04] spirit of adoption where you cry of a
[28:05] father
[28:06] you receive the spirit of adoption which
[28:08] can take you to adoption
[28:09] but you can either say i don't want it
[28:12] or not or do like brother brown said he
[28:13] said the holy ghost goes back and said
[28:14] your son is acting up
[28:16] your son's not doing the right thing
[28:17] your son's not doing this your son's not
[28:19] your daughter's not doing that
[28:21] that's the holy ghost going back to the
[28:22] father
[28:24] but in a natural in a bar mitzvah what
[28:26] happens is the kid
[28:27] the child comes to a certain age like 12
[28:30] or 13 years old
[28:32] and he's able to read in the temple he's
[28:34] able to go into the temple
[28:36] read scripture out of the temple and be
[28:38] able to do certain things
[28:39] that he was not able to do because he
[28:41] had come to a certain place that the
[28:43] father
[28:44] said i'm pleased with that
[28:47] he can do what we have required him to
[28:49] do
[28:50] because bar mitzvah means son of promise
[28:55] bar means son remember simon barjona son
[28:58] of jonah so this is the son of the
[28:59] promise
[29:00] what's the promise listen the promise
[29:02] was to israel you're my people
[29:06] you're i am going to adopt you and they
[29:08] were and they were going to do that in a
[29:09] natural they do it in a natural sense
[29:11] but
[29:11] they never came to adoption in a
[29:12] spiritual sense because god had to put
[29:14] them away
[29:15] you and i come to adoption
[29:19] by coming into the family and then the
[29:22] holy ghost saying hey
[29:23] he's got that virtue down pretty good or
[29:26] he's got some work on that
[29:28] knowledge and temperance and patience
[29:31] but you know what
[29:32] it's required in this age for us to go
[29:34] up that statue of a perfect man
[29:35] so as as dad said before it's not a it's
[29:39] not a
[29:40] i was thinking about this while he was
[29:41] preaching it you know when you go to
[29:42] college
[29:43] even when you go to high school but
[29:44] mostly in college if you're going to be
[29:47] a
[29:47] a doctor or you're going to be a lawyer
[29:49] or you're just going to be a
[29:51] get a bachelor or you're going to get an
[29:52] associate's degree there are certain
[29:54] classes that you have
[29:55] and required to take right right anna
[29:59] required then you have electives
[30:02] or fill-ins that really doesn't have a
[30:04] lot to do with your
[30:06] with your degree but if you're going to
[30:08] go to school you got to learn this
[30:09] certain thing over here
[30:10] right well see that's the way with us
[30:13] we've got there's certain requirements
[30:16] that me and you have to have
[30:19] in this end time there is requirements
[30:21] adoption is a requirement
[30:25] now elective could be the seven
[30:26] spiritual gifts speaking in tongues and
[30:28] all these see that's electives
[30:31] because listen you might not ever speak
[30:33] in your tongues the day of your life but
[30:34] you're still a child of god you're still
[30:36] born again
[30:37] so that's an elective course that you
[30:38] can take if you want to
[30:40] but the main course of this is is that
[30:42] god needs somebody
[30:44] to yield their self to him enough to
[30:47] where he cannot just speak to but
[30:50] through
[30:51] amen not just two it's good for god to
[30:53] speak to you
[30:54] but if we're elected for god to speak
[30:56] through us then listen
[30:58] it's got to happen because on romans 8
[31:00] 28 saying we know that all things work
[31:01] together for good to them that love god
[31:03] to them who are they called according to
[31:05] his purpose
[31:07] for whom he did for know he also did
[31:09] predestinate so he foreknew a group of
[31:11] people
[31:13] he knows who they are because they come
[31:14] from the mind of god
[31:16] and we'll get to this in just a minute
[31:18] remember that genesis 1 26 man
[31:21] came from the seventh dimension
[31:25] god alone remember god's the only one up
[31:27] there you say well now he's a
[31:30] pay attention genesis 1 26 man wasn't
[31:33] formed down here on the earth
[31:36] it was formed in the mind of god in
[31:38] glory in a dimension that
[31:40] that that adam could move and have no
[31:43] limitations at all right but then we had
[31:46] to be put in the first three dimensions
[31:48] because god knew we were going to fall
[31:50] he knew when we got put in flesh that we
[31:52] were going to fall but remember what's
[31:53] it going to come back to
[31:54] that genesis 1 26 man is standing on
[31:57] earth today amen
[32:01] just like it was in the garden of eden
[32:04] just like it was in the garden of eden
[32:07] now you got to decide whether you're
[32:09] going to be born of his bone in flesh of
[32:10] his flesh
[32:12] because that eve's part of it too
[32:13] remember eve's the bride
[32:16] for whom he didn't know he also for no
[32:19] he also did predestinate to what look
[32:21] to be conformed to the image of his son
[32:28] so you were conformed or you were formed
[32:29] in the womb of of your mother
[32:32] but you had to be conformed
[32:36] a lot of us had to be reformed i don't
[32:39] believe in reformation i mean reformed
[32:41] you know reshaped into what the image of
[32:45] his son listen if you got the new birth
[32:47] you're into the image of that genesis 1
[32:48] 26
[32:49] man which is the children of god the
[32:52] family of god
[32:53] god is your daddy so you've got that
[32:55] genetic makeup
[32:57] but now look but when he put that sixth
[32:59] dimension in place
[33:01] he knew that's who would go there and he
[33:04] set that place up now seventh dimension
[33:06] he's already up here but now
[33:08] where are you and i gonna go we'll read
[33:10] it
[33:12] we're gonna come back if if br you know
[33:14] brother ray and brother dick and brother
[33:15] tatum all the different ones
[33:17] brother richard marlow they're over
[33:18] there waiting on us
[33:21] now listen according to my bible
[33:23] according to the prophet's message
[33:25] they don't eat over here they tell they
[33:27] we don't eat over here
[33:29] right don't drink don't eat we're just
[33:31] it's just kind of a blissful place
[33:33] but that's got to come back here so they
[33:35] can pick up their body
[33:38] connected back to the earth that god
[33:41] cursed that kookaburra
[33:44] is going to be laying in the ground but
[33:46] when that transforming power of god
[33:48] sheds that away but when they come back
[33:51] and pick up their body
[33:52] it's not going to be a cuckleberry
[33:53] anymore it's going to be wheat germ
[34:02] but remember you and i have another
[34:05] commission
[34:07] we have a win over there we're standing
[34:10] right here
[34:11] this cuckoo bird is going to be changed
[34:13] into a wheat body spirit and soul
[34:15] somebody is going to happen here in this
[34:18] dimension
[34:20] because this will be a live message of
[34:23] resurrection
[34:24] and remember we're not looking for a
[34:26] rapture
[34:30] i'm looking for a resurrection because
[34:32] the resurrection the bible says
[34:34] we which are alive and remain they will
[34:35] be they will be uh brought up first
[34:38] then we which are alive and remain to be
[34:40] changed and caught up to meet them and
[34:41] yeah we got to get them here first
[34:43] before there's a rapture i i don't you
[34:45] know you can
[34:46] you can look for rapture if you want to
[34:48] but there's about three of them
[34:52] which one which one you want to be a
[34:54] part of
[34:56] right i want to be a part of the one
[34:58] where i don't have to be
[35:00] i want to be changed in a moment in 2011
[35:02] on this side
[35:03] that's a requirement for somebody
[35:06] somebody's got to reach that spot
[35:09] abraham doesn't matter how old you are
[35:13] you say boy i think zach will probably
[35:14] one of them that takes a body chain
[35:16] because he's just
[35:16] 20. shut up
[35:21] 21. i got shoes older than you
[35:27] 21 that's what we're coming back to but
[35:30] you know we think that we go man if we
[35:31] were standing in the bible and we were
[35:33] going all right who
[35:34] who's going to take the body change why
[35:35] there'd be the young people over there
[35:38] no that'd be easy
[35:41] but what about somebody like brother
[35:42] boyd or myself or dad and somebody like
[35:44] that and you go man
[35:46] nah they too old was abraham too old
[35:50] he was 99 ain't none of us got close to
[35:53] that yet
[35:54] when he was changed but i hope you get
[35:58] this tonight that's a requirement
[35:59] we have requirements we have we have
[36:02] electives that we can do
[36:03] and we can we can have the peripherals
[36:05] around the message and all these
[36:06] different things
[36:07] but while and i don't say waste our time
[36:10] on it because the gifts are not wasted
[36:11] but
[36:12] why would you jump over here though and
[36:14] take 12 elective courses
[36:17] and never take your required courses
[36:19] right
[36:20] you never graduate hey man does
[36:23] everybody get my analogy you'll never
[36:24] graduate if you stand over here and say
[36:26] no i'm going to take basketball
[36:27] knitting weaving i'm going to take book
[36:30] reading
[36:30] and and and
[36:34] and cartoon drawing and i'll make it
[36:37] i'll become a doctor doctor of what
[36:43] but that guy that sits over here and
[36:44] says man i got to take biology 101 102
[36:47] 103.
[36:48] i got to take anatomy i got to take i
[36:51] got a
[36:51] i got to cut a cadaver open and i gotta
[36:54] look inside this
[36:55] human body and make sure that i don't
[36:57] fall asleep or fall
[36:59] just fall you understand what i mean
[37:03] i think we've what brother brown has
[37:04] always said though we've majored on the
[37:06] minor
[37:08] is that not quote we've majored on the
[37:11] minor
[37:12] everybody likes to go to these meetings
[37:14] and have these good old feelings and
[37:16] jumping up and down which that's fine
[37:17] but what are you going to do when you
[37:18] come back over here and you got to take
[37:20] your normal courses
[37:22] that's okay you can take the electives
[37:24] all you want to but don't stay over here
[37:25] and say
[37:26] this is it i'll be a doctor
[37:31] of crayons and coloring books
[37:36] no if you're going to be a doctor you
[37:37] need to learn how to use knives
[37:40] and forceps and all them other different
[37:42] things
[37:43] same way with the gospel we need to get
[37:46] in this thing and like i said before
[37:47] we need to let what we got out listen
[37:50] even if you're not born again you
[37:51] definitely need to let out what you got
[37:53] inside of you
[37:54] amen and listen there's a lot of letting
[37:57] out to do with these
[37:59] remember the doors indoors you open the
[38:01] door and let the bat out
[38:04] you open the door and let the whatever's
[38:05] bothering you out we've got to start
[38:07] doing that if we don't do that we're
[38:08] going to stay here
[38:10] we're going to keep doing funerals you
[38:13] say how brother wait
[38:15] keep listen how do you eat an elephant
[38:19] one bite at a time
[38:23] that elephant of death we just keep on
[38:26] knowing at him
[38:28] just keep on chewing at him but by
[38:31] foreign knowledge
[38:33] he predestinated us to be conformed to
[38:34] the image of his son
[38:36] that he might be the firstborn among
[38:37] many brethren whom moreover
[38:40] whom he did predestinate them he also
[38:42] called
[38:43] whom he called he justified whom he
[38:45] justified them he also
[38:47] glorified and the rest of the scripture
[38:48] says how in the world can we lose if god
[38:50] be for us who can be against us
[38:52] amen so let's not worry about any of
[38:54] that okay
[38:56] now let's look for the dimensions just
[38:57] for a second we'll we'll cut this a
[38:59] little short
[39:00] because we know one thing's for sure we
[39:03] read this quote 20 times but look how
[39:06] can i take a huckleberry and make a
[39:07] grain of wheat out of it
[39:08] it's impossible the only way it can do
[39:11] is because the inside has been
[39:13] transmitted from a cuckoo bird wheat
[39:15] a cucumber to a germ called wheat life
[39:17] now we know what that is
[39:18] that's the baptism of the holy ghost
[39:20] that's the agape love
[39:21] that we must have to carry on our
[39:24] christian experience do you know most of
[39:26] the christian world
[39:27] is deceived
[39:32] sorry most of the christian world is
[39:36] deceived believing a lie
[39:39] and the bible says we'll be down by it
[39:43] and that includes many in this message
[39:46] now i don't mean
[39:47] new birth you got the new birth but now
[39:49] some people can be deceived
[39:51] if you stay in a deception that's the
[39:52] whole problem
[39:54] watch you watch this that's why god has
[39:57] let this thing go so long
[39:59] 50 60 years after the prophet preached
[40:01] us into a future home
[40:04] we're still here we're still dying
[40:07] we're still wondering whether i was
[40:09] thinking you know
[40:10] i read this quote again where brother
[40:13] brown was talking about going across the
[40:14] curtain of time
[40:15] he said with my hand on the bible i'll
[40:17] meet you at the day of judgment
[40:19] he said this is what happened now what
[40:21] about these people that are denying that
[40:22] brother brown's even a prophet anymore
[40:24] denying that he brought us a message you
[40:25] know
[40:26] he was wrong here and he was wrong there
[40:28] well i agree with him if he was wrong
[40:30] there he's wrong everywhere
[40:33] but he wasn't how can a man stand behind
[40:36] this desk
[40:38] you see what them people are doing when
[40:39] they deny
[40:41] the prophet of god in this end time they
[40:44] deny
[40:44] everything he ever said i'll he said
[40:47] i'll meet you
[40:48] at the day of judgment exactly he said
[40:52] how many times have i told you something
[40:54] and it come to pass
[40:58] too big of a witness folks for me to be
[40:59] deceived in that part i might be
[41:01] deceived somewhere else but i'm not
[41:03] going to be steven on that part
[41:05] when he went across that curtain of time
[41:06] i believe that man went across the
[41:07] curtain of time now why did god take him
[41:09] over there if he was a liar
[41:13] remember what brother brown said he said
[41:15] he said i can't say nothing until he's
[41:17] here
[41:18] he said cause i may you may ask me
[41:20] something one time
[41:22] and he said i may get it wrong and he
[41:24] said you would lose confidence in me
[41:25] then
[41:26] well how many millions of the time was
[41:28] it right how many times was it wrong
[41:30] zero wrong millions of times right okay
[41:34] i'll take that i'll rest my soul that
[41:37] jesus christ saved my soul but i'll rest
[41:39] my
[41:40] statue of a perfect man on that man
[41:42] bringing me a message that i can take a
[41:43] body change
[41:44] without death that's what he brought me
[41:48] he brought me to a place that you know
[41:51] what he done
[41:52] all them denominations started looking
[41:54] at the electives
[41:55] cabbage down what they cabbage down on
[41:58] electives
[41:59] they cabbage down on the minor stuff
[42:03] if they would have said okay this is the
[42:05] holy ghost this is the beginning
[42:07] and then carried on but that wasn't
[42:09] their message
[42:11] their message was to stop the message
[42:14] brother branham was
[42:15] trying to get them and bring them over
[42:16] here
[42:18] say look there's more sure that's
[42:19] elected but if you're going to be an
[42:21] astronaut
[42:22] you can't sit over there and play with
[42:24] tonka toys
[42:25] right or weave them legos it's nice
[42:29] hey don't laugh i've seen some beautiful
[42:31] things made out of legos
[42:32] but try to get anyone to fly out of the
[42:34] universe with it
[42:37] that's what we've been doing though
[42:39] we've been listening to
[42:40] kids putting legos together
[42:44] and saying i think we fly this thing out
[42:45] of here
[42:47] and then missing the real astronaut
[42:51] the true message of the hour where
[42:53] brother brown has brought us a message
[42:55] that cannot be denied it can sure it can
[42:58] be you can question
[42:59] anything they questioned jesus
[43:03] thought he was a devil said he hung
[43:05] around too much with sinners
[43:06] and prostitutes and he was a wine bibber
[43:10] boy he had a good testimony didn't he
[43:12] but look who was doing that though
[43:13] it was the devil in those people that
[43:15] was doing that amen
[43:17] so anyway that sweet life so light
[43:19] timing matters the first three
[43:20] dimensions we're going to skip through
[43:21] this real quick
[43:22] fourth dimension we know that was
[43:23] science but i want you to read let's
[43:25] read that one more time and questions
[43:26] and answers number two quote if you
[43:28] don't mind
[43:29] uh brothers number two two quote right
[43:31] past there you go
[43:33] because look why did he come on the
[43:36] seals we've been over this again and
[43:37] again and again why did he come up to
[43:39] the seals
[43:40] he come up to the sixth after the sixth
[43:43] seal he comes up to questions and
[43:44] answers
[43:45] six seals has opened he's getting ready
[43:47] to preach the seventh seal he says we're
[43:49] gonna have questions and answers
[43:52] and then they don't get it all right
[43:54] don't try to make yourself odd to be a
[43:56] christian because you see
[43:57] you take yourself away from god if you
[44:00] can understand it this is that third
[44:01] pull now what is the third pull
[44:03] the third pull is the opening of the
[44:04] word the third pull is
[44:06] going into a higher realm that brother
[44:08] brown said he cannot be
[44:10] impostered it can't be mimicked he said
[44:12] it's god alone that third pull
[44:14] is not to the devil it's to god's
[44:18] children
[44:19] because it's the opening of the word
[44:20] which the devil could follow the first
[44:22] two
[44:24] the devil could follow those first two
[44:26] and imitate
[44:28] the first two the hand and the telling
[44:31] of the things but now that third pull
[44:33] when he moved into that he said look you
[44:36] should have caught that the other day
[44:38] so they didn't catch it you remember
[44:41] there'll be no impersonation like there
[44:43] was of the other two
[44:44] see so that's as far as you should know
[44:48] now just remember that you see now
[44:50] there's something taking place
[44:52] in this room and there's something here
[44:55] there's
[44:55] actually in this room angels voice of
[44:58] god
[44:59] but how do you you can't if you can't
[45:01] hear the natural voice
[45:03] without something to send it out he's
[45:04] talking about radio
[45:06] how can you how are you going to hear
[45:08] the spiritual voice
[45:09] now listen to this now you might make
[45:11] believe look that somebody's singing
[45:13] this certain song
[45:14] and that's what the problem is there's
[45:15] been a lot of make-believe preaching
[45:17] doctrines that's not even
[45:18] right that's make-believe that's not
[45:21] true belief
[45:22] right he's coming back on a horse he's
[45:24] coming back on the cloud he's got to
[45:25] shoot a black bear he's got
[45:27] lord of mercy come on people get some
[45:30] spirituality about you
[45:32] brother branham will come back into this
[45:33] dimension but it's when somebody on this
[45:35] side
[45:36] will come to a place of full adoption
[45:41] and god will have to honor what they're
[45:43] saying
[45:44] just like when jesus stood and said
[45:45] lazarus come forth brother brown said to
[45:47] the same
[45:48] loud voice that brought lazarus from the
[45:50] dead
[45:51] is in me and you today oh glory so
[45:55] are we looking for a resurrection are we
[45:56] looking at the resurrection amen
[45:59] now look now you might make believe that
[46:01] somebody is singing this certain song
[46:03] that might not even be there see
[46:05] but when it actually strikes the crystal
[46:07] that is supposed to strike what's he
[46:08] saying
[46:09] the crystal's not there in 1963
[46:14] whatever 3 24 1963 those people that
[46:17] were sitting in that room
[46:20] now he didn't call them not christians
[46:22] he didn't say they weren't christians
[46:24] he said you're not getting what i'm
[46:26] preaching
[46:28] amen but when it actually strikes the
[46:30] crystal that it's supposed to strike
[46:33] then it gives a true interpretation and
[46:36] vindicates it by showing the picture
[46:38] see what i mean now the spirit of god
[46:40] when it speaks to the true word
[46:42] it vindicates itself to show itself that
[46:44] it's right
[46:45] right so now we now have the right
[46:49] crystal here
[46:50] we now have the right diamond cut right
[46:53] now today
[46:55] in this building and around the world we
[46:57] have the right
[46:59] crystal because he said when it strikes
[47:02] that crystal
[47:03] so it's got to strike something what
[47:06] strikes it the voice
[47:07] the vibration coming from god it strikes
[47:11] that crystal and then it what it
[47:12] vindicates it
[47:13] by showing the picture in other words it
[47:15] vindicates it by opening the bride up so
[47:17] everybody can see who she is
[47:20] everybody got them so to me that's
[47:23] another thing you know
[47:25] they stayed an elective
[47:28] they stayed with the shout and they're
[47:29] speaking in tongues and then when
[47:30] brother brown left the scene they said
[47:31] oh he was right in his
[47:33] when he was shouting and speaking in
[47:34] tongues and healing the sick and raising
[47:36] the dead but when he was preaching his
[47:38] doctrine
[47:39] when he was teaching you how to be a
[47:41] doctor and you were over here saying no
[47:42] that's not right over there why because
[47:44] it
[47:44] it was against what their curriculum
[47:48] everybody got what i'm saying they
[47:51] forgot the curriculum
[47:52] right the curriculum is to be a doctor
[47:56] you got to have and i think they even
[47:57] give you an outline don't they know they
[47:58] give you an outline if you want to be a
[48:00] if you want to be whatever this is what
[48:02] you got to take and for four years or
[48:04] six years you've got to take this
[48:06] right here to be whatever you want to be
[48:09] so there's a requirement when brother
[48:12] brown opened the seals there was our
[48:14] requirement
[48:15] we are required to live under an open
[48:17] book we are required
[48:19] to hear brother brown said we are now
[48:21] what messiahs
[48:23] we are now little eagles we are now we
[48:26] live off revelation
[48:29] we don't live off presumption we don't
[48:32] live off
[48:33] like he said here now you might make
[48:35] believe that somebody's singing this
[48:36] certain song
[48:38] that's what a false doctrine is it's
[48:40] just make-believe some certain song
[48:41] right god didn't bring that if it's
[48:44] false
[48:46] never has god brought a false revelation
[48:49] so if you hear false revelation it's not
[48:51] of god
[48:54] get out of that college the curriculum
[48:56] is wrong right
[48:59] so the fifth dimension we know what
[49:01] happened
[49:03] the brother brown looked in the fifth
[49:04] dimension where the center goes
[49:07] and remember it's not a burning hell
[49:08] brother luis covered that real good
[49:10] wednesday it's not a burning hell it's
[49:13] the place that you're put there and then
[49:15] then as we contend and i don't think
[49:17] it's presumption
[49:19] that they don't get a body change why
[49:21] would they get a body change and be back
[49:23] young again and they
[49:24] they didn't even believe in god and they
[49:26] didn't have the baptism of the holy
[49:27] ghost
[49:28] all happened was is their old dirty soul
[49:30] just moved over into a
[49:31] fifth dimension and i don't believe
[49:32] nobody helped them across either
[49:37] they probably drug them across
[49:40] but could you imagine
[49:44] though look at the sincerity though i
[49:46] want to
[49:47] stop right here in just a second you
[49:50] take those people that are muslims
[49:53] that kill their self
[49:57] for their religion and they want to kill
[50:00] as many as they can
[50:01] with them but they are guaranteed
[50:05] 72 virgins when they get into this
[50:08] dimension over here
[50:10] because see they believe in afterlife i
[50:11] hope they do because that's what they
[50:12] believe
[50:14] and then you've got you know anyway so
[50:16] anyway you got a pope
[50:19] that is the viker of god
[50:23] right supposedly when when they vote him
[50:27] in that that god that that the lord
[50:30] jesus moves into
[50:31] the pope and he's the viker he's the
[50:34] spokesman he's the one that you got to
[50:35] listen to
[50:36] right
[50:39] that's what right i mean come on reach
[50:41] study the catholic church if you really
[50:42] study that
[50:44] that supposedly that spirit moves into
[50:46] that pope
[50:48] well there's one moves into him all
[50:49] right now he thinks he's the vice he
[50:52] thinks he's a spokesman of god
[50:55] so when he dies he obviously must be
[50:58] going to go over here into a place
[50:59] i don't know if popes go to purgatory or
[51:01] not i don't know if they get a free
[51:03] bypass or what
[51:05] they get a free pass i don't know
[51:08] but i'm you'll see why silly it is but
[51:11] can you imagine as soon as that
[51:13] muslim why am i saying this because you
[51:16] better lay your soul on something too
[51:20] he's laid his soul that when he pulls
[51:22] that
[51:23] switch and he gets blown into a million
[51:26] pieces and he blows up whoever else
[51:28] who radical person they are that when he
[51:30] steps over into his
[51:31] sixth dimension there's going to be 72
[51:34] virgins palm trees and
[51:35] grapes for an eternity
[51:38] what a surprise
[51:42] he's gonna get what a surprise the
[51:45] pope's gonna get when he steps across
[51:46] the curtain of time and there's no
[51:47] purgatory there
[51:50] there's no place to pray them out of
[51:53] right because that's what they believe
[51:55] they believe that you go to a place of
[51:56] holding
[51:57] then they can either pray you out or you
[51:59] pay enough money to get you on into
[52:01] whatever they call their sixth dimension
[52:03] but see that's all presumption
[52:05] we've had a prophet go beyond the
[52:07] curtain of time
[52:08] said he had been to hell said he had
[52:10] been to heaven i believe he was in both
[52:12] places
[52:13] because he come back and showed it
[52:15] because he was an astronaut he came and
[52:16] show it to me and you
[52:18] so that number one you can take the fear
[52:19] away that even if something does happen
[52:22] we fall dead of a heart attack or
[52:23] anything happens to us
[52:25] that we know that across the curtain of
[52:26] time number one
[52:28] you're not going to want to come back i
[52:31] would assume
[52:32] i'm assuming here that them 72 virgin
[52:35] people and all them pope
[52:37] they want to get back here because they
[52:38] know they did something wrong this way
[52:40] but now brother ray is over there now i
[52:42] know he loves it to cathy and he loves
[52:43] his kids
[52:44] but there's no way he'd want to come
[52:46] back and there's no way we want him to
[52:48] come back before his time
[52:50] but he knows though he's coming back
[52:53] amen because we can read the bible
[52:58] we can see it in the bible and we can
[53:00] see it in the prophet's message
[53:03] that we have an assurity that we don't
[53:05] have just a hope
[53:06] i know the bible uses hope and faith
[53:08] together but
[53:10] i just i hope grandma made it
[53:13] i hope brother ray made it i hope
[53:16] you know if your hope's wrong where
[53:18] there's only two places to go
[53:20] right but we have an assurity
[53:24] the sixth dimension is christ let's go
[53:25] to the sixth dimension
[53:27] um number five please the saints dead
[53:30] saints or look he changed that
[53:32] he said dead saints or resting saints
[53:34] because remember death's been destroyed
[53:36] for a christian death has been destroyed
[53:38] there is no death brother ray didn't die
[53:41] he left his body and his body
[53:44] quit breathing
[53:48] and the cells that had all that firing
[53:50] mechanism that made him 98.6 degrees you
[53:52] know that's what your theophany is doing
[53:56] hello somebody your theophany is keeping
[54:00] your body at 98.6 degrees or 96.8
[54:02] whatever it is 98.6
[54:05] because when your theophany leaves your
[54:06] body it goes cold
[54:09] it's your firing mechanism listen even
[54:11] as a sinner you got a theophany
[54:14] everybody's got a theophany a soul
[54:17] everybody's got a soul and that soul is
[54:20] either going to go to one place or the
[54:21] other
[54:23] and brother brown said you know he's
[54:24] talking about paradise and all the
[54:25] different places
[54:26] we'll read in just a minute it's what
[54:29] you're familiar with
[54:30] it's where your soul is going to go
[54:34] see brother branham went into the fifth
[54:36] dimension now in a type he went into the
[54:38] fifth dimension not as a sin or dead
[54:41] but he went there and saw that place and
[54:43] he said horrible place don't want to go
[54:45] there do not touch the place
[54:46] but then when he goes into the sixth
[54:48] dimension he said leave me alone don't
[54:49] want to go back
[54:50] do i have to leave here but which place
[54:54] was he more familiar
[54:57] he saw them people in hell and he never
[54:59] recognized the one of them
[55:04] but when he stepped in that sixth
[55:05] dimension he said oh there's brother
[55:07] so-and-so there's my
[55:08] wife that died there's my baby there's
[55:10] my hey
[55:11] even his repossessed chair was there

[55:19] the
[55:20] angel said everything you loved he loved
[55:23] that chair
[55:25] but remember it was only like goodness
[55:27] you read the
[55:28] read his life story it was only like
[55:31] what a dollar a month
[55:34] uh hope had bought it for him and was
[55:36] making payments on it a dollar a month
[55:37] and they couldn't make the payments that
[55:38] he walked in one day and it was gone
[55:40] they had repossessed it
[55:42] well he said i love that chair well
[55:44] guess what he's the chair was me the dog
[55:47] the horse and his chair
[55:51] you say well that was just for brother
[55:52] branham no
[55:58] no that's for all of us
[56:01] the resting saints look who is
[56:02] completely work finished on earth
[56:05] and has entered into rest with christ
[56:07] under the altar beautifully
[56:09] you can pillar it like a wonderful dream
[56:11] that you don't want to wake up from but
[56:12] now look he said it ain't a dream
[56:15] it's natural it's real you know brother
[56:18] ray is more real now than he
[56:19] than he was when we saw him for 80 years
[56:21] on the earth we got to
[56:22] we got to get rid of this thinking
[56:24] thinking our stinking thinking is all
[56:26] poor

[56:31] he's 20 years old i want to see those
[56:33] pictures of him when he was he showed me
[56:35] a picture one time where character did
[56:36] when they got married the dapper little
[56:37] fella you know
[56:38] and that little dapper fella standing
[56:40] over there because the cuckoo bird's in
[56:41] the ground
[56:43] but they'll meet back up right we have a
[56:45] promise
[56:46] they'll meet right back up listen if
[56:49] brother brown
[56:50] if if brother brown looked at mita and
[56:52] she said brother
[56:53] said honey you've lost all your hair he
[56:55] said i ain't lost one
[56:58] every hair i ever had right because when
[57:01] he went back across the curtain time he
[57:02] said
[57:03] what did he do he put his hand that's
[57:06] the first thing he did he's like i'm
[57:07] bald-headed down here but he's like
[57:09] i got hair didn't lose the one brother
[57:12] that god got them all waiting on you
[57:14] there

[57:16] have to worry about it but
[57:17] amen 21 years old
[57:23] but remember
[57:26] you're from your your spirit is going to
[57:28] be familiar with one of them two places
[57:30] for what you are on this side
[57:33] you can't change it once you go and say
[57:36] no i think i'll jump over here
[57:38] or or go over here see that's what the
[57:41] lie of the devil is even in
[57:42] even in in the catholic church well if
[57:45] you get into this dimension we're going
[57:47] to pray and then all of a sudden you're
[57:49] going to wind up in this one
[57:51] come on people we know that's wrong but
[57:54] look it is deceiving about 50
[57:57] of the population of this world
[58:00] they rest their soul on that that the
[58:03] pope is jesus christ incarnate and that
[58:05] they can go into this
[58:06] they can live like the devil
[58:10] why do you think listen why do you think
[58:14] that gangsters and the mafia are all
[58:16] catholic
[58:19] father forgive me i'm gonna kill seven
[58:21] people tomorrow
[58:23] right oh say three hail mary's and we'll
[58:26] spring some water on you
[58:27] if you get into purgatory we'll pray out
[58:30] you see what i mean that's religion
[58:31] though folks that's religion
[58:35] that's what religion will do for you too
[58:37] it'll lie to you
[58:38] that's right this is there's not one
[58:40] line this message
[58:42] there's not one line in this bible
[58:46] you live it god's got to do it he's got
[58:48] he's obligated to his word he's not
[58:50] obligated nothing else
[58:54] paradise member of the witch of endor
[58:56] brought up samuel
[58:57] we'll go to quote six and seven save
[58:59] time go to first samuel 28 we noticed it
[59:03] in verse 14 says an old man
[59:08] an old man came up so even in paradise
[59:11] they weren't changed
[59:12] like we're talking about changing in the
[59:14] sixth dimension they would they what
[59:16] happened was is they just
[59:17] they passed away and they moved over
[59:18] into another dimension
[59:20] like they were and then even you know
[59:23] you see in the old testament i'm reading
[59:24] in samuel the first and second samuel in
[59:26] the kings
[59:28] the angel keeps telling david said
[59:30] you'll be gathered with your people he
[59:31] says jacob you'll be gathered with your
[59:33] people
[59:33] well brother branham was gathered with
[59:35] his people glory
[59:37] we will if brother ray is gathered under
[59:40] brother brown's message he's not there
[59:41] with paul's group
[59:42] he's not there with irena's group he's
[59:44] not there with pentecost group
[59:46] he's there with the bride of this age
[59:49] under our prophet messenger he's moved
[59:52] into that dimension part
[59:55] that was made for him because you know
[59:57] why his spirit wouldn't be familiar in
[1:00:00] luther's age
[1:00:03] his spirit wouldn't be familiar in
[1:00:05] wesley's age
[1:00:10] wouldn't in pentecost although he may
[1:00:11] have come up through pentecost
[1:00:13] but his spirit was familiar and that's
[1:00:15] where his spirit went to where what
[1:00:16] the word and the word connected
[1:00:20] the word that brother brown gave us the
[1:00:22] word that we got
[1:00:24] that's what's pulling us to that
[1:00:26] dimension where he is because even the
[1:00:29] even the angel says you'll be gathered
[1:00:30] with your people
[1:00:32] he said branhams said no you're converts
[1:00:36] amen so look
[1:00:39] so it was an old man in paradise but not
[1:00:43] in the sixth dimension so let's continue
[1:00:44] on
[1:00:45] perfect love real quick everybody all
[1:00:47] right say ma'am
[1:00:49] present stage of my ministry number
[1:00:50] eight i believe i was caught up in the
[1:00:52] sixth dimension looking back down here
[1:00:54] and could see back
[1:00:56] see the side isn't exactly with the eyes
[1:00:58] that's earthly
[1:00:59] but sight is a greater than greater
[1:01:01] thing than the sight that they have
[1:01:03] there
[1:01:04] their contact is far beyond any contact
[1:01:06] that our natural senses
[1:01:08] would contact then number nine
[1:01:12] let's read them down a little further
[1:01:13] where it says what is this let's go
[1:01:16] scroll down up the voice is what
[1:01:19] this is perfect love said
[1:01:22] isn't that what you spoke the holy
[1:01:24] spirit was now look not perfect love
[1:01:27] filio perfect love agape love
[1:01:31] the love of god the love of jesus christ
[1:01:33] that was sown in the people's heart
[1:01:35] i said yes and this is perfect
[1:01:39] love and what did i say perfect love
[1:01:40] casts out fear and you read all those
[1:01:42] quotes about that
[1:01:43] we'll continue on kind of hurry through
[1:01:46] let's go to number 10. he explains this
[1:01:48] really well
[1:01:49] cause we know about he'll be gathered
[1:01:50] with your people everybody's read the
[1:01:52] where brother brown says the angel says
[1:01:54] you'll be gathered with your people and
[1:01:56] then you're gonna have to give an
[1:01:57] account and you're gonna have to come
[1:01:58] back here and pick up your body
[1:01:59] and and then uh that's another thing uh
[1:02:03] i see that some people run across we
[1:02:05] preached here for years there's people
[1:02:07] that believe in this message
[1:02:08] that you're number one you're going to
[1:02:10] get a new body
[1:02:12] totally different from this one and they
[1:02:14] also believe
[1:02:16] one preacher told me with his own mouth
[1:02:18] that the bible says that when you walk
[1:02:20] out on the ashes of the wicked that
[1:02:21] you're going to walk out in the
[1:02:22] millennium on your own ashes
[1:02:25] which means your body's not going to
[1:02:26] make it your body's going to be burnt up
[1:02:28] with the rest of the world
[1:02:29] because it was wicked he just don't know
[1:02:32] this thing don't sin it's that inside
[1:02:36] guy
[1:02:36] but we're gonna be connected with this
[1:02:38] body even that woman told him in the
[1:02:40] quote before that we don't have to go
[1:02:41] back to it
[1:02:43] but she said we got to go back look i'll
[1:02:45] read it don't go back there and she
[1:02:46] looked at me and said brother branham
[1:02:48] jesus will come sunday
[1:02:49] then we'll go back to earth then we'll
[1:02:51] receive our glorified body
[1:02:53] then we'll live together forever in
[1:02:55] other words you're going to come back
[1:02:56] down and pick up your body
[1:02:59] and it's going to be changed
[1:03:02] that's a miracle glory it's not a
[1:03:05] miracle to just come back and say i'm
[1:03:07] eternal
[1:03:09] no jesus didn't do that jesus was
[1:03:11] resurrected in the body that he died in
[1:03:14] but it was what made new i can't believe
[1:03:16] that people have not read the future
[1:03:18] home enough
[1:03:19] to read where the bible says and all
[1:03:22] all all denominations believe that this
[1:03:25] earth is going to be totally annihilated
[1:03:27] because of where it says heaven and
[1:03:29] earth will pass away
[1:03:31] remember brother i had to go back and
[1:03:32] tell you what that word pass away was
[1:03:35] it wasn't that it's going to be
[1:03:36] destroyed it's going to be burnt off
[1:03:39] so the framework of this earth is going
[1:03:41] to be right here where we're at
[1:03:45] now what are you a part of right
[1:03:48] somebody say it that's real weak
[1:03:53] you're gonna be a part of this art
[1:03:54] you're a part of the earth your body is
[1:03:55] the part of this earth glory
[1:03:57] amen but when god cursed the earth
[1:04:01] he cursed adam and cursed the earth we
[1:04:04] have to put that what we have to plant
[1:04:06] it in corruption
[1:04:08] but the bible says we'll raise it
[1:04:12] that body in incorruption
[1:04:16] to me that's a miracle to me that is the
[1:04:18] total plan of redemption
[1:04:20] that he can take your body that came the
[1:04:22] wrong way
[1:04:24] it came totally contrary
[1:04:28] he can take that same body and change it
[1:04:32] because of what's inside of you to me
[1:04:35] that's a miracle
[1:04:36] to me that's what the devil can't
[1:04:38] understand because he's looking at you
[1:04:39] going
[1:04:40] how can you do that i'm not worried
[1:04:42] about me doing it
[1:04:44] that thing inside of me is going to do
[1:04:45] it
[1:04:48] that's agape love all right
[1:04:52] when god can change your vile body the
[1:04:54] bible says
[1:04:56] philippians he'll change this what a
[1:05:00] miracle
[1:05:02] and change it back to 20 years old
[1:05:07] you got that right sister you where you
[1:05:08] get 61. you'll say a lot louder than
[1:05:10] that
[1:05:13] now look does everybody understand that
[1:05:16] listen there's certain things that you
[1:05:18] should know
[1:05:19] and that one thing you should know we're
[1:05:21] not going to walk out on our own ashes
[1:05:25] oh we're not going to get a brand new
[1:05:29] one
[1:05:31] it's this body made new
[1:05:34] just same as the earth is going to be
[1:05:35] burnt off this thing by the holy ghost
[1:05:38] you've already been burnt out inside
[1:05:41] he's just going to burn the rest of it
[1:05:43] off
[1:05:46] the first is perfect love that's god
[1:05:48] love god's love
[1:05:50] pure and unadulterated the next comes in
[1:05:53] there is feel your love
[1:05:54] that's love you have for your wife and
[1:05:56] your children the next drops that is
[1:05:58] lustful love now that we
[1:05:59] you see that in the world they're just
[1:06:02] doing all kind of stuff
[1:06:03] the next is ungodly love and just goes
[1:06:07] on down till it's
[1:06:08] filth just keep on perverting perverting
[1:06:11] and everything had a beginning though
[1:06:12] look had an end
[1:06:14] filial love had a beginning
[1:06:17] lust had a beginning filth had a
[1:06:19] beginning
[1:06:21] agape love did not have a beginning
[1:06:26] let's read that again
[1:06:30] what quote number am i on i've lost my
[1:06:32] place thank you
[1:06:33] 10. all right thank you
[1:06:36] and everything that had the beginning
[1:06:37] has an end and all that will be taken
[1:06:39] right away and no remembrance of it at
[1:06:41] all
[1:06:42] and come right back to the perfect
[1:06:44] someday
[1:06:45] and the only way listen adam and eve
[1:06:48] walked in the garden
[1:06:49] man and woman naked naked
[1:06:52] naked whatever you want to call it naked
[1:06:57] and they didn't bother my bed they had a
[1:07:00] holy ghost veil over their eyes that you
[1:07:02] and i supposed to have
[1:07:06] because that's our conversion it brings
[1:07:08] us back to agape love and takes us
[1:07:10] sure we still have to have filial love
[1:07:12] but that's not from that very inside guy
[1:07:16] that very inside guy is turned back to
[1:07:18] agape love
[1:07:19] to where adam and eve could walk in the
[1:07:21] in the cool of the day in the garden
[1:07:23] and be totally naked and be there
[1:07:25] together and not be sinful and not have
[1:07:27] any
[1:07:28] sinful thoughts or not have any emotion
[1:07:31] everybody understand what i'm saying
[1:07:34] and everything that had a beginning has
[1:07:36] an end
[1:07:38] and all that was taken right away and no
[1:07:39] remembrance of it at all comes right
[1:07:41] back to the perfect someday and the only
[1:07:42] way look
[1:07:43] you can't stop down here half of the way
[1:07:46] and get up here
[1:07:48] you've got to be all the way in look
[1:07:50] trusting resting completely in the
[1:07:52] salvation that jesus gave to you by
[1:07:53] faith look
[1:07:55] there's a spirit let me read that real
[1:07:59] slow
[1:08:00] there is a spirit of honesty that comes
[1:08:02] from god
[1:08:03] that's the fountain fountain of god
[1:08:05] that's honesty
[1:08:07] the next isn't the man will do a good
[1:08:09] deed for his neighbor
[1:08:10] feel your love
[1:08:14] the next is the guy you have to watch
[1:08:15] him

[1:08:19] next is the guy's a murderer hold up see
[1:08:22] how it perverts right on down

[1:08:39] achievement's been proved by science

[1:11:02] justification the horse and buggy
[1:11:05] sanctification what was it automobile
[1:11:07] began to move along
[1:11:08] then the baptism in the holy ghost you
[1:11:10] took off the ground got your feet off
[1:11:13] got up in the air flying around in the
[1:11:15] heavenlies with heavenly gifts speaking
[1:11:17] in tongues divine healing
[1:11:18] now look he's talking about
[1:11:20] justification sanctification baptism
[1:11:22] holy ghost but he's talking about the
[1:11:24] the lutherans the westlands and the
[1:11:25] pentecostal the pentecostals did get
[1:11:27] their feet up off the ground the
[1:11:28] pentecostals did do the shouting they
[1:11:30] did do the speaking in tongues
[1:11:31] they did have the restoration of the
[1:11:32] gifts by the true baptism of the holy
[1:11:34] ghost
[1:11:34] but what happened they did just what i
[1:11:37] said they said this is it we can't go no
[1:11:39] higher this is
[1:11:40] airplanes as far as we can go right this
[1:11:42] is it
[1:11:44] but there was another group because
[1:11:47] there's a
[1:11:47] there's a star out you under that we
[1:11:50] need to get to and we can't do it in an
[1:11:51] airplane
[1:11:53] look them that was still in the
[1:11:56] automobile and still riding the horse
[1:11:58] and buggy
[1:11:59] thought that was the strangest thing
[1:12:00] they'd ever seen
[1:12:02] then people was having a fit but they
[1:12:05] got their feet off the ground
[1:12:06] god was able to bring the church his
[1:12:08] achievement when he got a bunch of
[1:12:10] people
[1:12:10] standing still long enough that he could
[1:12:12] pour his spirit into them
[1:12:14] the same horsepower that can pulse the
[1:12:16] horse
[1:12:17] did the same thing to the automobile and
[1:12:20] did the same thing to the airplane
[1:12:22] and the same holy ghost it brought
[1:12:23] justification to the church it brought
[1:12:25] more of it
[1:12:26] when it brought sanctification and
[1:12:27] poured it into the poured it in with the
[1:12:29] holy ghost
[1:12:30] still the same power right brought the
[1:12:32] same thing
[1:12:33] and took the church off its feet into
[1:12:35] the heavenlies now
[1:12:37] things has changed all together see i
[1:12:40] could have quit reading that quote right
[1:12:41] there and it just left you on an
[1:12:42] airplane
[1:12:44] amen they just put you on an airplane
[1:12:46] you say oh this is it it's great that's
[1:12:47] it nope
[1:12:48] he's not done yet thank god for a profit
[1:12:50] thank god for a profit
[1:12:54] now things has changed all together
[1:12:57] now look same horsepower
[1:13:01] same horsepower just more of it
[1:13:06] now things has changed all together
[1:13:07] because science is moving on and we're
[1:13:09] always talking about science
[1:13:10] but let's look back and see what our
[1:13:12] great scientific teachers are doing
[1:13:14] look what god's doing with his church
[1:13:18] scientific teachers now we've entered
[1:13:21] the age not no more of horse and buggy
[1:13:23] not no more of automobile now oh now
[1:13:25] brother i'm wait a minute now
[1:13:28] airplanes as far as we can go no
[1:13:31] not no more of airplane
[1:13:35] now there's astronauts oh my this is
[1:13:38] astronaut age oh what a great thing
[1:13:41] the horse in buggy was earthbound but
[1:13:43] now we are in astronaut age
[1:13:46] and so has the church that's the big
[1:13:48] swingover that i can't get before the
[1:13:50] people
[1:13:54] but we got the right crystal
[1:13:58] he wasn't talking to them he's talking
[1:14:00] to us
[1:14:03] that's the big thing over that i can't
[1:14:05] get before the people
[1:14:07] they've settled down for an airplane
[1:14:10] some of them settle for a horse and a
[1:14:12] buggy but god's got an astronaut
[1:14:15] age oh what an age to live in no wonder
[1:14:18] they can't understand it but you see
[1:14:20] where god lets man do something is to
[1:14:23] show the church
[1:14:24] that he's doing something see we're
[1:14:28] always trying to bring look now i'm
[1:14:29] going to read this and then we'll
[1:14:31] we'll close because we know what perfect
[1:14:33] love is i'm going to read one more
[1:14:35] on christ revealing his own word but
[1:14:37] let's go right here see they're always
[1:14:39] trying to bring the old thing back what
[1:14:40] i say horse and buggy
[1:14:42] i i can still see that horse and buggy
[1:14:43] over there you know it's a lot easier
[1:14:45] you don't have to change all
[1:14:48] you just got to feed the horse you
[1:14:49] understand what i'm saying going
[1:14:51] backwards though
[1:14:52] why would you want to go backwards right
[1:14:56] when the requirement is an astronaut see
[1:14:59] they're always trying to bring the whole
[1:15:00] thing back and now keep the horse and
[1:15:01] buggy it's just it's a relic
[1:15:05] oh my lord it's a relic
[1:15:09] it's history that was alright in this
[1:15:12] day but it's past
[1:15:13] that glory shake hands with the preacher
[1:15:16] was all right a long time ago but that's
[1:15:18] passed now
[1:15:19] denominations live this day out we're
[1:15:21] past that now
[1:15:23] we're in the astronaut age amen now i
[1:15:25] begin to feel religious astronaut age
[1:15:27] that's what's got the people all turned
[1:15:28] around
[1:15:29] they don't know what to think about
[1:15:31] these things they don't know how to get
[1:15:33] it
[1:15:36] notice yet the astronaut age is the same
[1:15:40] spirit they had
[1:15:42] same holy ghost baptized the lutherans
[1:15:44] westlands you understand
[1:15:47] now just like the horsepower was now in
[1:15:49] this astronaut age
[1:15:52] in the natural there's also the
[1:15:54] astronaut age and the spiritual
[1:15:56] what is it then the church from an
[1:15:59] airplane like the natural has took a
[1:16:00] higher flight
[1:16:02] while that astronaut there's no airplane
[1:16:04] going to catch him
[1:16:06] he's done gone to where he can't even
[1:16:08] see an airplane no more
[1:16:12] and that's the way god is doing now
[1:16:14] instead of being some little school guy
[1:16:17] come out and talk about a certain thing
[1:16:18] that dr so-and-so said years ago
[1:16:21] we got eagles prophets rising up in the
[1:16:24] heavenlies far above the earth-bound
[1:16:26] chicken thought
[1:16:28] only a kentuckian could say that a
[1:16:31] chicken thought
[1:16:33] but that's what it is we horse and buggy
[1:16:36] horse and buggy
[1:16:37] astronaut age look god's prove it god's
[1:16:40] proven it
[1:16:41] watch it let's watch it right here let's
[1:16:44] read this
[1:16:45] go to number 17.
[1:16:50] the last quote i want to read this right
[1:16:51] here christ revealed in his own word and
[1:16:54] then
[1:16:54] magicians get ready to come when they
[1:16:55] get finished
[1:16:57] that layout of cna's naked blind
[1:16:59] miserable don't even know it see it's
[1:17:01] out
[1:17:02] look it's that anointed anointed with
[1:17:05] the real spirit see
[1:17:06] that the holy spirit can fall upon a man
[1:17:09] in his spirit
[1:17:10] watch it now but his soul is his germ
[1:17:14] that german's word remember he he says
[1:17:16] that you can receive the baptism of holy
[1:17:18] ghost on your spirit every day of your
[1:17:19] life and die and go to hell
[1:17:21] that's what's happening to people right
[1:17:23] now because the third pull is what
[1:17:26] to the bride to the church and the
[1:17:29] totally lost
[1:17:31] we shout at the third polls for us but
[1:17:33] there's two other groups that you better
[1:17:34] watch out and you're not in that group
[1:17:38] amen the holy ghost can fall upon a man
[1:17:41] in his spirit
[1:17:43] but his soul is his germ that germ is
[1:17:46] the word and how i don't care how much
[1:17:48] you can preach
[1:17:49] how well you do this and how much you
[1:17:51] love look that's one of the inlets to
[1:17:54] the spirit
[1:17:54] right you can't love with
[1:17:58] your body you love with your spirit
[1:18:02] that's one of the inlets and you can
[1:18:04] love and even love
[1:18:06] god and still not be right
[1:18:10] you can love god with your spirit he
[1:18:11] didn't say soul
[1:18:15] listen your soul by the baptism of the
[1:18:17] holy ghost
[1:18:18] cannot produce filial love
[1:18:25] where where can it
[1:18:29] it's the love of god totally inside of
[1:18:32] you
[1:18:33] agape love you say well where do you
[1:18:37] love you love your spirit
[1:18:38] memory reason conscious affection
[1:18:40] imagination
[1:18:42] that makes me love my wife
[1:18:46] memory reasoning conscious affection
[1:18:48] affection
[1:18:49] that's not god's affection that's
[1:18:51] affection for your wife and then for
[1:18:53] your kids and then for your grandparents
[1:18:55] and all these different things
[1:18:57] you say oh my no you either love god
[1:18:59] with your soul
[1:19:00] or you love the devil there's no loving
[1:19:02] mom and daddy with your soul
[1:19:05] everybody got that it's one or the other
[1:19:08] you either love god or you love the
[1:19:10] devil you either got filial love
[1:19:13] on the outside got it outside realm
[1:19:15] spirit realm
[1:19:17] love god now that's not that love right
[1:19:20] there is not agape love
[1:19:22] that's filial love you can't love with
[1:19:25] agape love and be
[1:19:26] wrong because he is agape love
[1:19:31] you got agape love they got to come
[1:19:33] together
[1:19:34] but feel your love can't stand
[1:19:37] in front of agape love because with the
[1:19:40] white throne judgment
[1:19:41] those people that come to the white
[1:19:43] throne judgment they're going to stand
[1:19:45] in what they're going to be given
[1:19:47] account of what they do
[1:19:49] the works that they do filio works
[1:19:54] not agape works because agape works is
[1:19:57] going to be standing in judgment
[1:19:59] because it's the love of god they're
[1:20:02] going to have to give an account
[1:20:03] and they're feeling god i loved you i
[1:20:06] loved you i loved you
[1:20:07] remember what the bible says the bible
[1:20:09] says depart from me
[1:20:11] you workers of iniquity i never knew
[1:20:14] k-n-e-w
[1:20:15] not new like i knew him k-n-e-w k-n-e-w
[1:20:18] is like adam knew had relations
[1:20:22] with eve he knew her
[1:20:25] jesus said you never had a personal
[1:20:28] relationship with me you just had
[1:20:31] an experience of an emotion
[1:20:34] i'm telling you that's what's happening
[1:20:36] to a lot of people you just get an
[1:20:37] experience of an emotion
[1:20:39] and still not be right you can cast out
[1:20:42] devils and preach
[1:20:45] aren't we seeing that happening in the
[1:20:46] end time
[1:20:48] preach like a house on fire on a windy
[1:20:50] day
[1:20:51] and be living in adultery
[1:20:56] we've seen that happen it's manifested
[1:20:58] we know these people that has happened
[1:21:00] you can cast out devils and preach and
[1:21:02] do these things still not be right
[1:21:05] look this is my last deal and y'all come
[1:21:07] on jesus said so said many would come in
[1:21:09] that day look
[1:21:10] that word settles it that's it the word
[1:21:14] settles it ignites listen there is no
[1:21:17] filial love
[1:21:18] in the word of god it's all agape love
[1:21:23] because it's the love of god what shed
[1:21:25] abroad in our hearts by the baptism of
[1:21:27] the holy ghost let's stand to our feet
[1:21:29] come over to the musician
[1:21:35] you make sure that you make sure that
[1:21:37] you make sure you're loving god with
[1:21:38] agape love
[1:21:40] and if you love him with agape love he
[1:21:42] has to respond
[1:21:45] because it's his own self responding to
[1:21:47] his own self
[1:21:49] brother brown said when the word meets
[1:21:50] the word
[1:21:52] when the word meets the word so when
[1:21:53] agape meets agape you know one thing's
[1:21:55] for sure
[1:21:58] you can give your life for your kids you
[1:22:00] can give your life for your family you
[1:22:02] can give your life for your wife
[1:22:04] but you can't ever transfer that life
[1:22:06] into another person
[1:22:07] and make them eternal right but god can
[1:22:11] he's already done it at calvary that's
[1:22:14] what he done
[1:22:15] he released the life so that you and i
[1:22:19] can get that agape love
[1:22:22] we listen we all got to live and feel
[1:22:24] your love we got we love our
[1:22:25] our mother and our and our wife and all
[1:22:28] we love them with godly love
[1:22:30] if you're if you're a godly person
[1:22:33] but without agape love you can't love
[1:22:36] god
[1:22:37] you can do all this love i love i love i
[1:22:39] love i love i love and then you're gonna
[1:22:41] stand before the white throne judgment
[1:22:43] and jesus is gonna say you never love me
[1:22:47] like i wanted you to love me i died for
[1:22:50] you what have you done for me
[1:22:52] amen and that's what brother ray
[1:22:54] accepted whenever he got born again he
[1:22:56] accepted that god died for him
[1:22:58] amen he accepted that love
[1:23:01] that he that there's a man could die
[1:23:03] called god
[1:23:04] jesus christ and could put his life in
[1:23:06] ray gabriel
[1:23:07] and then when brother ray when this body
[1:23:09] couldn't handle it anymore when his body
[1:23:12] retired got tired
[1:23:15] couldn't function because listen we're
[1:23:17] in three dimensions we still got to
[1:23:19] function our kidneys
[1:23:20] have to function our brain has to
[1:23:21] function our everything's got to
[1:23:23] function
[1:23:24] we're not supernatural in our body we're
[1:23:27] supernatural in our soul if we're born
[1:23:29] again
[1:23:29] so that supernatural to brother ray just
[1:23:32] stepped over into a fat it just got
[1:23:34] faster

[1:23:36] made a cut and never made a sound

[1:23:52] off
[1:23:53] and they said oh brother ray we've been
[1:23:54] looking for you and then what they said
