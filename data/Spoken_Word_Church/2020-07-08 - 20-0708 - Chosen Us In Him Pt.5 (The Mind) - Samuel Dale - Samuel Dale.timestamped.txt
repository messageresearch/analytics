[21:44] we love you and we thank you and we
[21:46] commit it all to you now in Jesus name
[21:48] Amen
[21:50] hope you enjoyed this past weekend I
[21:52] really did had a good time and all
[21:54] hoping you hoping you did okay Ephesians
[21:56] we've been reading this for a while but
[21:59] we're gonna try to place it together if
[22:02] we can so we go to Ephesians 1 which is
[22:05] read 3 and 4 lessened be the God and
[22:08] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has
[22:10] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[22:12] in heavenly places in Christ according
[22:17] as he has chosen us in him who in Christ
[22:20] before the foundation of the world that
[22:23] we should be holy and without blame
[22:25] before him in love heart now let's go to
[22:29] Philippians Philippians I want to try to
[22:35] pick this up and bring the thought
[22:36] together out of Philippians 2:5 let this
[22:41] mind be in you which was also in Christ
[22:43] Jesus who being in the form of God
[22:45] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[22:47] God but made himself to be of no
[22:49] reputation and took upon him the form of
[22:52] a servant and was made in the likeness
[22:54] of men and being found in fashion as a
[22:57] man he humbled himself and became
[22:58] obedient unto death even the death of
[23:01] the cross amen
[23:02] okay we want to go to Jeremiah see if we
[23:05] control these scriptures together
[23:07] Jeremiah 1 verse 4 and 5 he said then
[23:12] the word of the Lord came unto me saying
[23:15] before I formed thee in the belly I knew
[23:18] thee and before thou cometh forth out of
[23:22] the wound I sanctified thee and ordained
[23:25] thee a prophet unto the nations you may
[23:29] be seated the Lord had his blessing to
[23:31] the reading of the word Amen so I want
[23:35] to try to get you know into I thought
[23:37] that we've been in for a while and you
[23:40] know covering it toward that we can can
[23:43] see the word of the Lord as it's made
[23:44] manifest in our day alright so if we
[23:47] were kind of little to the company just
[23:50] bear with us and and think about what
[23:53] we're
[23:54] trying to say we've been talking about
[23:56] for quite about for services as a fifth
[24:00] service talking on predestination all
[24:04] right and we went through a lot of
[24:07] things covering it you know and knowing
[24:10] that in this hour it's a great doctrinal
[24:12] issue of predestination nation of the
[24:16] Hmong the denominational world and in
[24:19] things and we went through trying to
[24:21] open up their eyes or our eyes to
[24:24] understanding and how to do we can see
[24:27] that we use Calvinism and Arminianism as
[24:31] the two thoughts of the religious world
[24:34] to come forth and you know they both try
[24:38] to preach salvation but they have a
[24:40] different way each one to Express and
[24:43] their thoughts well we're not trying to
[24:45] differ with nobody but trying to get a
[24:48] better understanding the world is
[24:50] divided pretty well in the point of
[24:53] predestination because some people
[24:56] believe that your predestinated you know
[24:58] that's that's it
[25:00] if God seen me saved I'll be saved so I
[25:03] don't have to worry about it but if he
[25:05] didn't and I'll just be lost well now
[25:07] that's taken to the one side of the view
[25:11] but what about the other side of the
[25:12] view to her that you can say well I
[25:14] sought after God he he chose me he
[25:18] accepted me and and I gave my life to
[25:21] him to you know to become a Christian
[25:24] and trying to get things into the
[25:26] correct order but now if what have we
[25:29] been trying to do God's thoughts are
[25:32] eternal
[25:34] he doesn't add to or take away from his
[25:38] thoughts so his thoughts are eternal now
[25:41] what he thought of is not always eternal
[25:46] because he thought of a world it's not
[25:50] eternal he thought of all kind of things
[25:52] he's out of a lot of people coming into
[25:55] the world and and they will never
[25:57] receive eternal life because you know
[25:59] that's that's the point but he told them
[26:02] not just because he thought of you you
[26:04] say well I'm glad to think about the
[26:07] fact that
[26:07] that God thought of me before the world
[26:10] every begun because we read diary we
[26:13] were chosen in him who in Jesus Christ
[26:15] the word before the foundation of the
[26:17] world all right
[26:18] and then readings Jeremiah to where he
[26:22] say you know I knew thee for dainty
[26:24] before the foundation of the world and
[26:26] all like that then we say well
[26:29] everything is is said on that and one
[26:31] group said everything is predetermined
[26:33] because that's what predestination says
[26:36] if something is predetermined
[26:38] alright now see then if you go on the
[26:42] point of predetermined you're gonna run
[26:44] aground in your scriptures but if you'll
[26:46] go with the truth of understanding what
[26:49] it really is so he said those who he
[26:52] foreknew he did predestinate all right
[26:57] so then predestination comes into view
[27:00] in a simple form of being the
[27:02] foreknowledge of God God foreknew now if
[27:07] he didn't for know then he's not God you
[27:11] know if he doesn't have the ability to
[27:12] be able to for knew all for know all
[27:15] things it wouldn't be that he would be
[27:17] God he'd be just like me and you and
[27:19] he'd be trying to change things and and
[27:22] do things different before knowledge he
[27:25] is the knowledge before of what it is
[27:28] the fact that foreknowledge then comes
[27:32] into view to where that God could look
[27:35] back now I saw this on a something
[27:39] another day and that's the hidden what
[27:41] I'd like to talk to that guy for a
[27:42] little bit but he was talking about
[27:44] foreknowledge in predestination and in
[27:48] his doing but what he was a saying was
[27:50] he said there's God's foreknowledge go
[27:54] forward or backward you know and I said
[27:58] well in my thoughts you know if his
[28:00] foreknowledge is eternal then it's true
[28:04] that it can go just as far back as it
[28:07] can go forward he said no no he just
[28:11] thought about this here no know if this
[28:15] you're talking about an eternal God with
[28:17] foreknowledge then what would be the
[28:19] difference and going back that away
[28:21] going that away because it's going to
[28:24] come in a circle and it's all going to
[28:27] come together one day to where the the
[28:29] past present and future is all going to
[28:32] come into one point right so then when
[28:38] we think about predestination as being
[28:41] that God stamped it predetermined it if
[28:45] we're going to be saved we're gonna be
[28:46] saved but if we're gonna be lost we're
[28:48] gonna be lost
[28:48] well now where would that be leaving
[28:50] what would you be doing by foreknowledge
[28:52] then you set yourself in a destiny form
[28:57] to think about well I can't change it
[29:01] why me try to well see that goes into
[29:05] the doctrinal ideas of mankind of
[29:08] predestination but if you go to the
[29:11] point of foreknowledge and think about
[29:14] foreknowledge as being first now if you
[29:18] think of predestination that God
[29:20] predestinated something be careful
[29:22] because you'd be pre determining right
[29:27] you'll be pre determining the
[29:29] destination and mankind would have
[29:33] nothing to do with it he said well our
[29:36] salvation brothers of the Lord it is
[29:38] right which you've got to accept it you
[29:42] got to believe it what's wrong with it
[29:46] see foreknowledge then can go this as
[29:49] far forward as it does backwards because
[29:51] it's foreknowledge of God all right but
[29:55] if you set it on a destiny basis which
[29:58] is what the word predestination means
[29:59] means a destiny set all right then if
[30:03] you put it on a destiny set then how can
[30:07] the Word of God come together to give us
[30:10] an understanding all right now let me do
[30:15] this before we start because of red DS
[30:18] and just let me give you because we
[30:20] believe that God sent us a prophet in
[30:22] and also we just read into but see we
[30:25] believe in this this is what I believe
[30:27] because it's what the Prophet believe
[30:29] now believes what the Bible said because
[30:30] what I just quoted those who he foreknew
[30:33] he
[30:35] predestinate so foreknowledge is the
[30:38] dealing of what we need to do and and
[30:41] then we can see a destiny can be set by
[30:43] God's foreknowledge all right
[30:46] foreknowledge then has to come first
[30:50] I've emphasized that over to you for
[30:53] week after week for knowledge has to be
[30:55] first because if it's freed if it's
[30:58] predestination first then your pre
[31:02] determining I don't care what you got to
[31:06] say your pre determining it huh let's
[31:11] see for knowledge then predestination is
[31:13] the destiny that you're going to and see
[31:18] if that come first it will be back here
[31:22] let's see God's foreknowledge lets him
[31:26] see and set your destiny because of his
[31:29] foreknowledge of the choice
[31:31] he knows you make all right so what is
[31:35] it
[31:36] predestination then looks back to for
[31:41] knowledge for knowledge sets back here
[31:45] and looks all the way through until it
[31:49] can make a complete circle to ties back
[31:51] to eternity all right sees in
[31:56] predestination is not a bad word if you
[31:59] understand it by saying that it's by
[32:02] foreknowledge but if you understand it
[32:05] that the foreknowledge has to be first
[32:07] do you understand my my point if you say
[32:10] predestination comes first
[32:11] now foreknowledge because if
[32:15] predestination comes first your destiny
[32:17] was determined for you got here you
[32:20] would not have a choice of salvation but
[32:23] by foreknowledge he could see and set
[32:27] the destiny and it would come out to be
[32:30] so what is it doing then predestination
[32:33] is a great thing to look back to the
[32:38] point of God's foreknowledge because see
[32:41] what I want you to see if you don't get
[32:44] nothing out of the message I want you to
[32:46] get a wonderful thought in your mind if
[32:47] you could
[32:49] you know if you can pound the
[32:51] predestination and make it to words you
[32:54] can say well it's this it's that it's
[32:55] that you know if I was meant to be saved
[32:57] I'll be safe I wouldn't have won if you
[33:00] get all that out of your mind and get
[33:03] down to the fact we were chosen in him
[33:08] but why did he choose us you don't hear
[33:16] that talk about it why did he choose us
[33:21] he had to have some reason for choosing
[33:24] us now we know for goodness and God help
[33:29] us to understand that it can't be
[33:31] something good that we are because the
[33:35] Bible says he's got none good no not one
[33:38] it can't be that way it has to be based
[33:42] upon some way for God to have it to set
[33:45] a destiny he has to set that destiny by
[33:48] knowing the choice and what it was and
[33:53] he knew that before the world ever begun
[33:57] he said well then do we have a choice we
[34:00] have the choice but remember he chose us
[34:04] all right that's fine
[34:07] but remember you must accept the choice
[34:11] you didn't choose him we didn't come
[34:14] into this world trying to choose God and
[34:16] we wasn't searching for him it was him
[34:18] searching for us right it wasn't God in
[34:22] the garden I mean Adam running around
[34:24] hollering guard it was God in the garden
[34:26] trying to find Adam you know all right
[34:29] we'll get it all straight it'll come out
[34:31] to a beautiful picture then we can see
[34:33] the Bible unfold all the way through all
[34:37] right and then see then do you
[34:38] understand once and then predestination
[34:41] cannot be your first out of line you
[34:44] have to have the thought of line as
[34:46] foreknowledge because if not you are
[34:50] going to predetermine see but if you put
[34:56] it foreknowledge and let him see what
[35:00] you will do
[35:04] right then you can talk about
[35:07] predestination okay now here's the
[35:13] thought I want you to consider for a
[35:15] moment as we get to that point God's
[35:21] thoughts are eternal right you can never
[35:24] have a new thought all right but as I
[35:29] said now everything he taught us not
[35:31] eternal so don't get tied up into all of
[35:33] that well I'm glad I was you know a
[35:35] thought in his mind you could be a
[35:36] thought in this mind of Satan was a
[35:38] thought in God's mind right
[35:42] he thought of Satan and all he would do
[35:43] so don't go that line get back onto the
[35:47] straight line of trying to follow it but
[35:49] I wanted to ask you a simple question
[35:51] this is the burden that's been on my
[35:53] heart all this week to try to express
[35:55] something to you
[35:58] does God change his mind about his word
[36:04] and don't answer because you may want to
[36:08] pull back your answer a little later
[36:11] because of the approach that I'll take
[36:16] there's God never change his mind about
[36:24] his word
[36:30] he said no because if he ever has a
[36:32] thought okay
[36:33] he ever has his dog that thoughts
[36:35] eternal but that don't make everything
[36:40] eternal just because he thought of it he
[36:43] fed in your mind and listen to what I'm
[36:45] talking about
[36:47] he learned the Bible it was a man one
[36:50] time think his name was his a car was a
[36:52] king or something he a prophet went up
[36:57] and told him that thus saith the Lord
[36:59] set your house in order you're gonna die
[37:04] he prayed cried out before God and I've
[37:06] got even where the Prophet said the
[37:08] people loved him and they prayed cried
[37:10] out and God sent the same prophet back
[37:15] and told him that I'm gonna give you 15
[37:19] years well did he change his mind
[37:34] did he change his mind or did his mind
[37:40] come into view now you say by
[37:47] predestination that man was
[37:50] predetermined because God sent the
[37:53] Prophet to it to tell him thus saith the
[37:55] Lord
[37:56] you will not or are you going to die and
[38:01] he prayed and God came down and said
[38:06] I'll give you 15 years did God change
[38:09] his mind well it looks like he did but
[38:14] how can he change his mind when his mind
[38:16] is is his word in this words eternal
[38:25] think about it you ever thought about it
[38:29] I was looking to bear a little bit and I
[38:31] know brother Branham uses at 52 times
[38:33] where he speaks of the fact that prior
[38:36] changes things see now if we put
[38:42] everything on a predetermined factor
[38:45] like I told you when you got into the
[38:47] Armenian was in an army and the
[38:49] Calvinism doctrinal issues back in time
[38:51] it got back there so set it with people
[38:54] about predestination until they would
[38:58] not have a revival because they was
[39:04] afraid that their children might get
[39:07] saved now I'm quoting it from the book
[39:10] now I'm not my mum
[39:13] reading it of what they said they were
[39:16] afraid that their children might get
[39:19] saved when God might not want them saved
[39:24] he said now how dumb could anybody be
[39:29] well let me say it this way if you don't
[39:32] give your family a chance or people
[39:35] around you a change
[39:37] what are you setting it on
[39:43] you know what are you setting it on is
[39:47] this thing set and predetermined to be a
[39:50] certain way or is it my God's
[39:53] foreknowledge that he knows how it will
[39:55] be
[39:56] which way if you set it to the basis
[40:00] that it's got to be that away then let's
[40:03] go home we're wasting time
[40:07] you know let's forget it no it's not
[40:13] based that way then is it did he change
[40:18] his mind when that man was doing that by
[40:24] predestination that would say the
[40:27] destiny was set by the word of the
[40:30] Prophet that said thus saith the Lord
[40:33] sets your house in order you're going to
[40:36] die that means by God's predestination
[40:44] if you're going to put it in that form
[40:45] then that man had to die then he sent
[40:54] the same prophet how would you like to
[40:56] bend that prophet how would you like to
[41:00] be the Prophet might wind up like
[41:03] brother Adam did that time when he told
[41:05] that girl that was thus saith the Lord
[41:07] she was gonna live and she told her mom
[41:10] the next morning or something she was
[41:11] dying she's going home she died even
[41:15] brother branham I didn't understand it
[41:17] he went before God and and told him he
[41:19] said you how you all being an
[41:22] explanation
[41:25] he said he let me pout it out about
[41:28] three months and he come to me and told
[41:32] me what the story was saying I remember
[41:34] the girl said she was drowning in a
[41:37] outing they were having she'd got in the
[41:40] river and was drowning and they pulled
[41:44] her out of there and later on the bank
[41:46] and she was probably dead you know as
[41:49] far as by looking at her and all but you
[41:51] know by the time they got through we're
[41:52] getting the water out
[41:53] every time she raised up she lived a
[41:55] year longer the girl that he was said
[41:57] telling that she was going to live he
[42:02] said I gave her time to make up her mind
[42:07] well how are you going to put that in
[42:09] your predetermined factor I asked you
[42:12] how can you put that in a predetermined
[42:15] factor so you cannot do it that's what
[42:21] I'm saying but how would you like to
[42:25] been the Prophet they went down her and
[42:26] said set your house in order for thus
[42:28] saith the Lord you're gonna die he goes
[42:31] off and gone for a little while he's
[42:33] over praying and God comes down to him
[42:35] and says go back over and tell him and I
[42:40] won't give in 15 years now here's my
[42:46] point if you don't get nothing else out
[42:48] of the message we can just go on get the
[42:51] point of what I've been driving at which
[42:54] comes first predestination or for
[42:59] knowledge by predestination of a
[43:05] predetermined factor you cannot fit that
[43:08] scripture you would have to say it
[43:16] looked like God changed his mind but did
[43:22] he
[43:27] not your prophet saying prayer changes
[43:29] things you mean everything is so
[43:36] predetermined set on the factor that
[43:38] that everything is just set and this is
[43:41] what's going well what are we worried
[43:43] let's go home forget it but by believing
[43:53] in foreknowledge being first and then
[43:59] God by that foreknowledge could foresee
[44:02] and follow all the way through and see
[44:05] the destiny now listen that King was
[44:14] told set your house in order for thus
[44:17] saith the Lord you're gonna die you know
[44:22] what God didn't change his mind man died
[44:27] 15 years later right come on so did God
[44:36] change his mind arose his mind in the
[44:38] view did God know before the world what
[44:42] that man was going to do did he know
[44:45] before the world that he would send the
[44:47] Prophet and tell him to get it in order
[44:49] he's gonna die but yet he would come
[44:51] back and send the same prophet and tell
[44:54] him he was gonna live you see if you
[45:03] approach it by foreknowledge you can see
[45:06] that God by foreknowledge set back and
[45:09] saw and he knew he sent that prophet he
[45:12] knew he would go down there but he knew
[45:14] he would turn around and extend the man
[45:17] 15 years onto his life but the man would
[45:20] eventually die so it never broke the
[45:24] word the prophets word was right set
[45:29] your house in order for thus saith the
[45:31] Lord you're going to die why did it
[45:34] matter how long it took
[45:40] he gave him 15 years there's no way that
[45:48] God changed his mind he didn't change
[45:50] his mind and give him another way
[45:54] because his mind was not sat that away
[45:56] his mind was sat on the basis that by
[45:59] foreknowledge he could foresee what that
[46:05] man was gonna do and what he was going
[46:07] to do he could then predetermine it to
[46:14] be that the man would eventually die the
[46:17] prophets words was right you understand
[46:24] what I'm talking about when the Prophet
[46:26] told that girl that she was going to
[46:28] live the next morning she died did God
[46:38] change his mind
[46:42] no see that's one of the things the
[46:49] Prophet emphasized that we think
[46:52] predestination is discussed pushed put
[46:55] in a pot and push it through the other
[46:57] end and we come out some way and we have
[47:01] no choices to make
[47:07] that's another rod that's what he said
[47:12] I've read these to you he said that's
[47:14] not right but see by foreknowledge he
[47:20] could set back and see what you're now
[47:25] gonna do he could see you everybody
[47:27] sitting here today so I didn't know the
[47:29] brother and sister is gonna be here I
[47:30] didn't know you know I could kind of
[47:32] guess on maybe a lot of you to be here
[47:34] and I haven't ours the brother and
[47:36] sisters are with us not glad to have
[47:38] them
[47:38] I didn't know that back there another
[47:40] little boy especially back there with a
[47:43] sister and I said I didn't know that was
[47:48] he guarding you it before the world ever
[47:50] begun
[47:54] his doubts are eternal but remember the
[47:59] point what he thought of is not always
[48:01] eternal does he changes not no he
[48:06] doesn't have to change his mind his mind
[48:11] was set before the world you think God
[48:14] didn't set back before the world ever
[48:15] begun and look down and see that
[48:17] Hezekiah king and see what he would do
[48:20] would see that he would have to send
[48:22] that prophet right back to him but he
[48:27] would turn and see him to die
[48:29] later on after 15 years so he didn't
[48:32] change his mind see this whole thing is
[48:39] set on the basis of not my
[48:41] predestination by foreknowledge point of
[48:44] what we're going to do and not going to
[48:46] do
[48:46] it's the foreknowledge God determines by
[48:53] you and I see not his will that anybody
[48:56] if it's not the will of God did anybody
[48:58] be lost right he wanted everybody say
[49:03] the same price paid for everybody but
[49:09] then those who he foreknew would want
[49:13] him then that fondant would that would
[49:21] determine the destiny see now we want to
[49:26] put it cuz we want some kind of a
[49:28] something that we're great seeds or some
[49:30] kind of something that we are we're
[49:32] something special he nothing in this
[49:35] building special for nothing but just
[49:36] destruction you take what you want to
[49:40] and that's you thank you is good like
[49:42] I've always said they run a thing one
[49:45] time you know there's a joke about it
[49:47] but don't let me run a thing one time
[49:49] they've got to find out about the Dales
[49:50] did they come over here on the Mayflower
[49:53] you know everybody my family come over
[49:55] on the Mayflower minded to stowaway
[49:57] horse thieves in the back of one of the
[49:59] boats
[50:04] you see they nothing no good about any
[50:07] of us and I'm sure glad God's not
[50:13] looking at what we do and don't do
[50:17] but that man that King had a desire in
[50:21] his heart sure we know okay come on
[50:25] all we know is the stories a lot of
[50:27] times we take the Bible stories and we
[50:29] will and we bring out what we want you
[50:31] don't hear people bring out about him
[50:33] being that would actually change the
[50:36] point of what was taking place oh you
[50:39] hear out of the man there the King is
[50:41] what well he order died because got 15
[50:48] years and he did he wound up being a
[50:51] rascal of a bad King and should have
[50:54] died yes the world would have been the
[50:56] children of Israel would have been
[50:57] better off had he died 15 years prior to
[51:00] them because he turned out to be a
[51:03] rascal but that's all we look at we look
[51:05] at something like that and think that's
[51:07] a great revelation instead of looking to
[51:09] the fact of seeing that that man
[51:11] actually touched God God didn't change
[51:16] his mind
[51:17] but he touched God prayer changes things
[51:25] come on if I didn't believe it that way
[51:28] what would the prophets say one day he
[51:29] said if you ain't got enough faith for
[51:31] gonna see you for you to believe for
[51:33] your children he said I doubt you've got
[51:34] enough for your own self oh did you get
[51:38] that one if you ain't got enough to
[51:43] believe for your children and then lost
[51:46] and going on into the world and do it
[51:49] come on somebody prayed for you somebody
[52:00] prayed for you it might have been
[52:02] great-great grandma right might have
[52:08] been somebody you never knew nothing but
[52:12] they were praying for their descendants
[52:17] he ever had God to speak to you about it
[52:20] I've always prayed for my children pray
[52:24] God save my children one day he spoke to
[52:28] me he said you'll be there with your
[52:30] offspring he gave me the scripture so
[52:34] what did I do
[52:35] I didn't quit praying because they still
[52:40] ain't all in yet I keep praying but I'm
[52:45] praying for him to fulfill his word now
[52:50] cuz he told me well see if we don't want
[52:56] to we don't want to get into those
[52:57] things but what about the Dalton family
[53:00] when the Prophet turned to them and said
[53:02] all your children will be saved
[53:05] one after the other they all came to the
[53:09] Lord
[53:13] maybe we're not praying correctly sure
[53:17] we prayed here we prayed this away we
[53:19] prayed God you come down we pray
[53:24] seriously because it's supposed to be we
[53:27] prayed God come down and do what you got
[53:30] to do to bring my family in put him in
[53:33] the hospital did the prophets say that
[53:37] about Billy Paul when he went to the
[53:39] hospital he was laying up in the
[53:40] hospital bed and he said daddy press
[53:42] he said you send you pray right is that
[53:47] supposed to be the story whether it was
[53:49] true or not I still believe it could I
[53:52] believe that's the way he talked he said
[53:55] you pray because you've sinned see
[54:00] predestination we try to set the destiny
[54:03] of something without knowing anything
[54:05] about the foreknowledge that precedes
[54:08] all of that and not looking back I mean
[54:17] I'm 80 years old if time goes on i
[54:19] lolled I write I don't think I'm gonna
[54:23] live to be a hundred because I'm not
[54:25] worried about it
[54:25] would you just get to Portland talking
[54:28] about
[54:29] looking forward to it I just know the
[54:31] fact that it's gonna creep up on or some
[54:33] of us right all right but see I ain't
[54:38] depending on that away
[54:39] that's a destiny I'm looking back to
[54:44] where I come from that's a foreknowledge
[54:50] see that's what I've been driving to you
[54:53] about that's what the Prophet would say
[54:54] he said predestination looks back to
[54:58] foreknowledge he said in foreknowledge
[55:00] looks to destiny well does not listen
[55:03] what I'm talking about you get it
[55:05] see predestination we look that away for
[55:08] knowledge we look that away well you
[55:09] know what you know what uh who would
[55:12] have thought it this in school anyhow
[55:14] understand Einstein said then if you had
[55:18] infinite or he say that unlimited
[55:22] eyesight and you looked out like that
[55:26] you know what you see the back of your
[55:31] head because everything's in a circle
[55:36] Einstein could see that but around said
[55:41] I'd like to kind of hold him and talk to
[55:44] him about that finite universe everybody
[55:48] were infinitely finite I get that all
[55:50] messed up you put it in the right place
[55:51] because you got the education I don't
[55:53] but listen then why do we want to go
[55:59] with predestination to try to find a
[56:04] destiny why not go to for knowledge to
[56:11] see then I can go all the way back
[56:13] around and come right back around me
[56:14] stand-in there cuz for knowledge would
[56:18] go this far that way as it goes that way
[56:22] see we want to foreknowledge there's
[56:24] something behind us God don't look
[56:26] behind us I'm glad of that when you went
[56:30] down there oh oh bailing whenever I said
[56:32] look here look look what they're doing
[56:33] look at the Honda parks look at all the
[56:36] things that's taking place trying to
[56:37] remind God of it he said I see no
[56:43] problem in Israel that's wonderful when
[56:46] he was telling him the truth he shortens
[56:51] of our said the hunger part so it must
[56:53] have been the bad things and he said I
[56:56] don't see that you know why because he
[56:59] failed to see the shout of the King that
[57:01] was in the camp of the children of
[57:03] Israel the prayer changes things you
[57:10] know what it changed me from a sinner to
[57:12] a saint it changed you from a sinner to
[57:20] a site well I'll just meant now that
[57:28] wasn't just meant to be it's what I said
[57:33] we want to we want the things that we
[57:36] can play with in their mind so we when
[57:39] we start talking like that yeah but God
[57:41] chose me God chose me okay man well if
[57:48] he chose me I didn't how to do it now
[57:50] wait a minute you got to accept it
[57:53] pardonez not a pardon unless received as
[57:56] a pardon am i right won't bring you out
[58:00] of jail and actually accept what the
[58:01] pardon says see we look at something we
[58:08] we wanted our way and we can only handle
[58:11] that one word in one thing and that's
[58:13] why I tried back guardar to emphasize it
[58:15] over and over sure God chose us but you
[58:20] know what I like about it there was some
[58:22] reason you don't think that way are you
[58:29] talking about how good or how bad I was
[58:31] and what I was this out of the other
[58:35] because I can quote the Prophet the more
[58:38] flaws are the one that are you know he
[58:40] picked the Moses and look what he doing
[58:42] he picked this one they look what he
[58:43] done picked Abraham he lied look what he
[58:45] done when I've always tried to get you
[58:50] to look at and you won't do it you want
[58:51] to get on to some kind of seed doctrine
[58:53] and follow a line
[58:56] Esau was away owner better man than
[58:59] Jacob was let's talk about the Bible
[59:04] Esau was a greater man than Jacob was
[59:10] God said I love Jake cooking a Hades oh
[59:16] there's no such thing in the word in God
[59:19] anymore to have a word of hate
[59:21] so what's he saying I disliked his ways
[59:26] what was the difference between Jacob
[59:29] and Esau anybody want to get up and take
[59:33] it
[59:34] tell me the good that Jacob done he saw
[59:40] was away on a better guy but our checkup
[59:46] was stealing everything he could get but
[59:52] even after doing all of that the guard
[59:55] would come to hand in when Jacob is
[59:58] coming back he sends his family cause
[1:00:01] he's like oh he gonna kill me I'll just
[1:00:03] give him everything I got maybe maybe
[1:00:05] it'll appease him or something Esau
[1:00:08] comes walking toward him and he thinks
[1:00:11] I'm gonna die and he saw just throws
[1:00:14] down everything and reaches and grabs
[1:00:16] him and hugs him said my brother Jacob
[1:00:20] says take all of this he said I got more
[1:00:22] than you got let's see we want it on
[1:00:27] some kind of a way of something we try
[1:00:30] to make it if it if it don't work with
[1:00:32] grace we try to go over on to look
[1:00:34] something we didn't do or didn't do
[1:00:35] that's why I use that over and over and
[1:00:37] over about Calvinism Calvinism believes
[1:00:40] or teaches basics of Calvinism that if
[1:00:43] there's just a certain people that are
[1:00:45] to be saved that everybody is not to be
[1:00:48] saved
[1:00:49] that's Calvinistic teaching Armenian
[1:00:52] said he gives it for everybody we know
[1:00:55] everybody ain't gonna be saved but it
[1:01:00] ain't because of God in his ways oh when
[1:01:03] I first read that and when I found him
[1:01:05] during the church age book and started
[1:01:07] reading when that prophet started
[1:01:09] talking
[1:01:10] about that African and I'm not throwing
[1:01:13] iphone races or anything you know better
[1:01:14] than that
[1:01:15] but there they were those people that
[1:01:20] never heard of Jesus Christ in any way
[1:01:22] that God is going to judge them
[1:01:25] according to how they live by their own
[1:01:28] laws you ever thought you could hear
[1:01:34] that out of a Baptist no no cause we've
[1:01:38] got away with them Baptists nine
[1:01:40] throwing off on the Baptist just telling
[1:01:41] it like it is within Baptist had always
[1:01:43] said you've got to be born again because
[1:01:47] you ain't born again you ain't going
[1:01:51] well we can stand here and talk oh not
[1:01:54] about a Jew that comes down through
[1:01:55] there has never accepted Jesus Christ
[1:01:57] but they're given eternal life one day
[1:02:00] he's that on his predestination or is it
[1:02:04] on his foreknowledge that that was his
[1:02:06] children
[1:02:07] that was his people that he put them in
[1:02:10] bondage and out of the way to bring you
[1:02:14] and I in the route their church routes
[1:02:19] is Jewish oh you don't want to hear that
[1:02:22] thought right the foundation of all of
[1:02:26] our religious belief is Jewish because
[1:02:31] they were the chosen of God that's why
[1:02:35] you don't hear me thought I'll none of
[1:02:36] these things but which do you own you
[1:02:44] want for knowledge or you want
[1:02:45] predestination there's one thing about
[1:02:50] it if it's about foreknowledge then I
[1:02:52] know one thing for sure I've been in on
[1:02:55] this thing I don't know where do you
[1:02:57] understand what I mean by that but I've
[1:02:59] lived life how about you and I sure
[1:03:02] ain't lived the life to where he could
[1:03:03] accept me so don't get that in your mind
[1:03:06] I've lived the life to the point that he
[1:03:09] didn't need to accept me because that's
[1:03:10] what I like about it all the greatest of
[1:03:14] all in all and and the purity that man
[1:03:17] was living by the laws and the thing and
[1:03:19] he said you know no no marker against me
[1:03:22] he said but I'm
[1:03:23] chiefest of sinners what about a man
[1:03:28] like that that you couldn't put a marker
[1:03:30] against his life he was in training to
[1:03:35] be a high priest or a lawyer or whatever
[1:03:36] coming down what about it
[1:03:41] high priest couldn't have a mark against
[1:03:43] him none whatsoever
[1:03:47] he died he did after the faces on the
[1:03:54] base of basis of not trying to appease
[1:03:56] God to where he would make a choice with
[1:03:59] me no work no no I don't want the choice
[1:04:00] to be made because of what I would do or
[1:04:02] what I wouldn't do I want the choice to
[1:04:04] be done because what I he's my daddy
[1:04:09] see I never had a daddy coat daddy died
[1:04:11] not four years old but you see I never
[1:04:16] had nobody to stand in that places and
[1:04:18] daddy had brothers inside but one day I
[1:04:21] found my daddy or he found me that's
[1:04:26] more like it
[1:04:28] any game their choice I was a deacon at
[1:04:35] 23 years of age anybody knows that 50
[1:04:39] years ago you didn't make a deacon out
[1:04:41] of a 23 year old kid that's too much you
[1:04:43] forget it I understood that but there I
[1:04:46] was 23 years old an ordained deacon in a
[1:04:48] Baptist Church
[1:04:50] because I served and tried to do
[1:04:53] everything I could to serve God in the
[1:04:55] whole I didn't have to come into message
[1:04:58] and quit this and quit that it was
[1:05:00] already gone that's what I've tried to
[1:05:08] tell you the predestination does God
[1:05:13] change his mind about his word or did he
[1:05:19] set back before the world and see what
[1:05:21] he would do when he come to that king he
[1:05:28] said okay Oh King I'll give you 15 years
[1:05:33] your prior sincerity honesty
[1:05:37] didn't give it to everybody so it must
[1:05:38] have been something about the man that
[1:05:39] was good now here's what I'm gonna try
[1:05:41] to get to you could it actually be that
[1:05:45] God is looking at your desires and my
[1:05:48] desires instead of looking at his own
[1:05:49] because I can prove he's not looking at
[1:05:51] his we see we want to take that then and
[1:06:00] we want to make it to brother Dale I III
[1:06:04] know you're right you didn't drink smoke
[1:06:07] and this that and the other and all but
[1:06:09] but I did
[1:06:11] well what so what so what did you say
[1:06:17] well I'm I'm not as good as other people
[1:06:21] where does God put it on goodness that's
[1:06:26] what I've tried to prove to you God
[1:06:28] should have went with Esau cuz he saw
[1:06:31] was the greater man you tell me in the
[1:06:38] garden Cain and Abel oh that okay and he
[1:06:41] was a serpent seed oh that's it what was
[1:06:44] he God offered him salvation said would
[1:06:47] you not be accepted had you done like
[1:06:49] your brother now if he offered it to him
[1:06:52] then there's one thing about it God
[1:06:54] would be a respecter of persons if he
[1:06:55] didn't give it to him if he wanted it
[1:06:57] now that's as straight as I can make it
[1:07:00] if you wanted it start for you if you
[1:07:04] want salvation and not children it's not
[1:07:05] for you it's not something that we try
[1:07:08] to make ourselves to be some great big
[1:07:10] seed doctrine or idea if I was born with
[1:07:12] this seed enemy I'll be all right coated
[1:07:14] I'll make it where's food of the seed it
[1:07:16] was put tight before the foundation of
[1:07:18] the world according to the Bible because
[1:07:19] he was he foreknew us before the world
[1:07:22] he died before the world that you and I
[1:07:24] could be saved they were gonna get into
[1:07:34] Christ's mystery of God revealed I've
[1:07:36] asked you to read that code and want to
[1:07:37] get into it where the Prophet said God
[1:07:38] had in the back part of his mind a plan
[1:07:42] and a purpose
[1:07:44] that he was going to achieve yes brother
[1:07:50] Dale ever since you've been ever since
[1:07:53] we've been around you with we always
[1:07:55] paid attention to you to you don't like
[1:07:57] these seed doctrines I don't like seeing
[1:08:02] doctrines that goes the wrong way I know
[1:08:07] there were no seed in me if it was where
[1:08:11] was that now come on
[1:08:15] pre determining or foreknowledge
[1:08:19] where was that see that where is it now
[1:08:26] it's in your soul by the baptism when
[1:08:28] the whole to go right if there's any
[1:08:33] seeded out I don't want no seed in this
[1:08:34] body no one received my spirit rim it's
[1:08:37] got to be in my soul now try to take
[1:08:42] that back before the foundation in the
[1:08:43] world or take it forward to a
[1:08:45] predetermined you see that's the point
[1:08:49] that we're doing we're trying to make
[1:08:53] things out of the Bible instead of
[1:08:55] letting it be what it is this message
[1:08:59] cover come to bring us a new Bible when
[1:09:01] I started reading this message I started
[1:09:03] reading it I read the Bible before then
[1:09:05] I started reading this message I
[1:09:08] couldn't find no difference because I
[1:09:10] could find the same God talking to me
[1:09:14] that was talking to me when I was in the
[1:09:17] Baptist Church
[1:09:18] I look forward come on he said oh boy
[1:09:29] one of these days I'm gonna be a
[1:09:31] millionaire one of these days I'm gonna
[1:09:36] be rich he'd be kind of like the guy was
[1:09:41] it what he he got the newspaper a day
[1:09:44] ahead of time and man he could just tell
[1:09:46] everything he gonna take place he could
[1:09:48] bet on never horse race he could do
[1:09:50] everything cuz he had the newspaper a
[1:09:51] day ahead of time fictitional story but
[1:09:54] it tells the truth
[1:09:57] he was really having a wonderful time
[1:09:58] until he read one day and he could turn
[1:10:00] to the obituaries a day before okay well
[1:10:09] good is it me and I being I what good is
[1:10:16] it there was a time when we were in
[1:10:20] school talking about things like that I
[1:10:21] did go to a little bit but we talked
[1:10:24] about what it would be and they said
[1:10:25] back then I forgot what it was and if I
[1:10:28] get it wrong you put it right but it was
[1:10:29] somewhere like a 10 but 10 or 12 but 12
[1:10:31] room that if you put a million one
[1:10:34] dollar bills that fill that up because
[1:10:37] that's what everybody thought nobody
[1:10:38] could ever get a millionaire I mean we
[1:10:42] never thought about being a millionaire
[1:10:43] right because that was telling how much
[1:10:47] it would just stack it up and and it
[1:10:49] would cover a what see down million
[1:10:51] dollars told me nothing you can have a
[1:10:55] million dollars today and be broke as
[1:10:57] can be tomorrow just my pipes of the law
[1:11:00] up being her but take one thing about it
[1:11:08] you'd say well that'd be my destiny one
[1:11:11] day to be a billionaire know my destiny
[1:11:15] is to find out who I was and how I got
[1:11:19] here that's my destiny that's the thing
[1:11:25] that thrills my soul is to be able to
[1:11:27] look back and see what he done for me he
[1:11:36] wrote our name in the book of life with
[1:11:37] the foundation of the world right
[1:11:43] and he didn't predetermine it that to
[1:11:46] come through and be no but he foreknew
[1:11:51] before knew
[1:11:54] okay listen let me take another thought
[1:12:06] because these are the two things for
[1:12:10] knowledge and you won't for knowledge or
[1:12:15] you want predestination well I'd like to
[1:12:17] have the Destiny that I know what it's
[1:12:19] going to be no I'm having a wonderful
[1:12:21] time trying to find what I need I may
[1:12:25] come out home I'm enjoying my life of
[1:12:29] the fact of what God had led me I know
[1:12:33] and realized who it was I saw him when I
[1:12:36] was 11 years old you know the story I
[1:12:38] saw him standing in that church I went
[1:12:42] back by there years later and said god I
[1:12:44] hated left I because when I left there
[1:12:47] you were staring at Milton I was 11
[1:12:50] years old
[1:12:52] something spoke said when you left I
[1:12:55] left we well I could have been the devil
[1:13:01] telling me that I'd even agree with him
[1:13:06] because when I left I was moving on I
[1:13:13] thank God for the journey that I've had
[1:13:16] for the opportunities I've had and
[1:13:18] listen to me church Ivan I'm this away
[1:13:21] ever pastor that I've ever had I went to
[1:13:24] them when I left them and told them how
[1:13:27] much I appreciated them for what they
[1:13:29] had done for me in my life and trying to
[1:13:31] help me in Christianity and I walked
[1:13:33] with some good ones but I thank God I
[1:13:40] thank them for helping me
[1:13:47] I was sitting there Sunday listening to
[1:13:51] brother minister and I said Lord it's
[1:13:56] good to hear somebody talk about what
[1:13:58] you believe you saved do you agree right
[1:14:02] now now just to get all for that what
[1:14:04] does it matter what I understood I
[1:14:07] agreed with I thought he done a good job
[1:14:11] marvelous understanding huh I'm not
[1:14:16] stamping him as the finality of he's
[1:14:19] this Morita leader he's the Prophet that
[1:14:21] was to come
[1:14:21] no I'm just telling it like it is I
[1:14:23] enjoyed it because he were talking about
[1:14:27] my daddy I love for somebody to talk
[1:14:33] about daddy because I never had one so I
[1:14:35] don't but then I found my daddy my
[1:14:43] family nothing the Baptist Church I went
[1:14:47] back to the pastor of the church that
[1:14:49] time and thanked him for helping me when
[1:14:51] I left and left churches and this
[1:14:55] message always go to the pastor thank
[1:14:57] him for helping me why because anybody's
[1:15:02] ever helped me I thank God for it
[1:15:03] because there's one thing about it I
[1:15:05] couldn't make it by myself you can't
[1:15:06] either that's what you're thinking you
[1:15:08] think I made it on my own no you didn't
[1:15:10] make it on your own you're gonna die on
[1:15:15] your own little pity party house to you
[1:15:20] one more thought what do you think about
[1:15:24] when you say not foreknowledge Webster
[1:15:30] says that means knowledge before you
[1:15:33] know for knowledge those who he foreknew
[1:15:38] he predestinated he foresaw that's why
[1:15:44] we read it learn in Jeremiah I knew they
[1:15:49] said what about telling Jeremiah that he
[1:15:54] knew him before the foundation of the
[1:15:57] world before he ever come through his
[1:15:58] mother's womb
[1:15:59] he knew him and ordained him to be a
[1:16:01] prophet one of these days I'll get to
[1:16:05] that to where we're gonna preach on
[1:16:07] predestinated gifts I've preached a
[1:16:10] little bit to you just enough to get you
[1:16:12] to think predestinated gifts Malachi 4
[1:16:15] was a predestinated gift why because it
[1:16:17] was God's Word I don't look at brother
[1:16:21] Branham as being God or anything like
[1:16:23] that no but takes one thing about it the
[1:16:25] word that's what I look at it is not the
[1:16:27] person that comes predestinated from God
[1:16:29] it's the word our seed the word I
[1:16:36] rejoice in the word that I've been able
[1:16:38] to hear what do you think about for
[1:16:44] knowledge you ever think about for
[1:16:52] knowledge is just a simple little word
[1:16:53] called the mind
[1:17:03] I mean God had foreknowledge right so
[1:17:06] that's you know what that meant
[1:17:07] that meant in his mind he thought this
[1:17:11] thing out you go with me in his mind he
[1:17:18] thought it huh so what is foreknowledge
[1:17:19] the mind of God and like I said very
[1:17:24] minute ago I don't want to be just a
[1:17:25] thought in God's mind because sinners
[1:17:27] are thoughts in cars man no I want to be
[1:17:29] a part of God's mind I want his mind as
[1:17:33] far as the scripture said if this mind
[1:17:36] be in you the mind therein we gave the
[1:17:43] scripture it's talking about the Lord
[1:17:44] Jesus Christ and there he was that mind
[1:17:47] but that's exactly talking about me and
[1:17:50] you he has given us his mind the new
[1:17:57] birth is the mind of God imparted unto
[1:17:59] man known as that's in my soul oh
[1:18:03] brother
[1:18:03] well what is your soul is what are you
[1:18:11] come on
[1:18:13] are you a Mormon that believes in pre
[1:18:15] existence of souls
[1:18:18] no do we believe in reincarnation of
[1:18:22] soul you know going from one to another
[1:18:27] no see if the mind that was in Christ
[1:18:33] being you it'll do what and make a new
[1:18:35] creature right a new creation right to
[1:18:41] have his mind to come into your mind not
[1:18:42] his brain not his brain the new birth is
[1:18:48] not in your brain that's what I was
[1:18:51] asking the brother when I said where's
[1:18:53] it at where's to see that is it in your
[1:18:56] brain is it in your body is any feet is
[1:18:58] it in your hand is it words of that he's
[1:19:02] ain't talking to you answered what are
[1:19:03] you doing how London say anyway well
[1:19:06] because he couldn't do it what can you
[1:19:07] say
[1:19:13] but we spend our time putting it some
[1:19:16] seed doctrine and we just rejoice over
[1:19:18] Oh can't you just see that we was back
[1:19:21] to her we was actually back now let me
[1:19:28] say it the way I mean it the only way
[1:19:33] that I can know I was back to her is by
[1:19:36] what I'm doing right now what you are
[1:19:40] right now
[1:19:42] is the only thing that can be talked
[1:19:44] about of being back there because I'm
[1:19:47] talking about the soul not no bodies
[1:19:50] back there
[1:19:51] not no spirits back there that's the
[1:19:53] profit where we spirits in he said no we
[1:19:56] was in the what we was in the mind of
[1:19:59] God what is the mind of God the
[1:20:02] foreknowledge of God that he was back
[1:20:04] there before anything then and then we
[1:20:06] went little bitty identities they draw
[1:20:08] it out and make it look beautiful and
[1:20:10] make you a heart or something and put
[1:20:11] little dots in it and people hoager look
[1:20:14] at that I'm worried little dots I ain't
[1:20:18] no little dot I'm a person and I put my
[1:20:24] salvation in Jesus Christ and he's made
[1:20:27] me his he's become my father by a new
[1:20:29] birth so now I know my father I have my
[1:20:34] true father I can rejoice and say thank
[1:20:40] you daddy you don't never talk to him
[1:20:43] like that
[1:20:44] I heard Billy polish at one time he said
[1:20:46] he went to pick up brother Branham so
[1:20:48] you walk down to the motel redwood and
[1:20:50] said you heard him sitting in our saying
[1:20:52] Papa Papa you know what if you're born
[1:21:02] again that's not you have a Papa you
[1:21:09] have a Papa because he's your Papa he's
[1:21:15] he is what we have need of that's not
[1:21:20] degrading your mom and daddy no because
[1:21:25] if
[1:21:26] have this name new birth in their heart
[1:21:27] they have the same father they have the
[1:21:31] same mother who is our mother the Lord
[1:21:33] Jesus Christ do you think about it where
[1:21:41] we spiritually know we was in the mind
[1:21:45] of God now watch where we spirits then
[1:21:54] know theirs in the mind of God
[1:21:58] there's your foreknowledge the pre
[1:22:01] determining would be trying to put you
[1:22:03] that away uh-huh
[1:22:05] let's don't go that away oh it's
[1:22:09] wonderful one day when we get there
[1:22:11] it'll be so great we can walk on the
[1:22:13] streets of gold and we can do all of
[1:22:15] these things and have a great time and
[1:22:17] rejoicing over I'm having a good time
[1:22:21] now if you ain't I'd like to talk to you
[1:22:25] about my daddy for a while I'd like to
[1:22:28] tell you how daddy can tell you what
[1:22:31] daddy can tell you like he told me one
[1:22:33] day I was well I was dead loud I would
[1:22:36] just cried and it's down and out I got
[1:22:40] in the car and started down the road and
[1:22:41] met Terrence or Wade won and they said
[1:22:43] wait Gordon Eddie I said I'm going for a
[1:22:45] ride I'll be back in a minute I drove
[1:22:49] down nearly the maysville crying about
[1:22:51] how bad it was and about that time a
[1:22:55] little voice said who do you think you
[1:23:00] are and what do you think this is
[1:23:03] compared to what I went through I came
[1:23:09] back up the road crying my heart out of
[1:23:12] joy that he would be willing to
[1:23:19] associate with me I can stand here and
[1:23:24] tell you you know that's true I've done
[1:23:26] it I can tell you things where God met
[1:23:27] with me with that don't make nothing out
[1:23:30] of me
[1:23:30] that makes something out of my daddy
[1:23:36] what is foreknowledge forget it
[1:23:39] it is the mind of God and it's broke
[1:23:43] down so far until it comes into your
[1:23:46] mind not your brain to bind into the
[1:23:49] mind of your being which is your soul
[1:23:51] and gives eternal life to that soul and
[1:23:54] gives you then the very life of Almighty
[1:23:57] God there's my daddy living now and me
[1:24:01] and Paul said tonight that I now live in
[1:24:03] the flesh I live by the faith of the Son
[1:24:05] of God he said it's not I that liveth
[1:24:13] you see he said in the mind for our
[1:24:28] changes things
[1:24:30] I'm not asking God to change his mind
[1:24:38] God's secret mystery he had before the
[1:24:42] world will begun now back in the back
[1:24:44] part of God's mind there was something
[1:24:47] he was going to to do back in the back
[1:24:54] part of his mind you say well that ain't
[1:24:57] even sensible
[1:24:58] it's identically any nurses oh come to
[1:25:04] respect you okay
[1:25:10] you got your brain and I'm not a doctor
[1:25:14] but the front part of your brain is your
[1:25:16] intelligence your thinking ability then
[1:25:20] you keep going back in to
[1:25:21] subconsciousness and things then you get
[1:25:23] back to a real mind that mind that's
[1:25:28] there is what's controlling you and that
[1:25:36] is the new birth you got many stages of
[1:25:41] the human mind so when the prophet would
[1:25:43] say in the back part of God's mind you
[1:25:49] know what we don't have to get into the
[1:25:52] back part of his mind to find out what
[1:25:55] we're talking about in the back part of
[1:25:58] his mind is the baptism of the Holy
[1:26:01] Ghost
[1:26:04] he goes back to for knowledge but
[1:26:09] brother Dale do you want to go Thatta
[1:26:12] way or that way if I had the choice I'd
[1:26:15] like to go Thatta way back into God's
[1:26:19] mind but just remember one thing
[1:26:24] predestination one more thought be
[1:26:29] careful how you predetermined things
[1:26:32] because you could predetermine yourself
[1:26:35] out of existence now by foreknowledge I
[1:26:42] can make this statement by
[1:26:44] predestination I dare not make it that
[1:26:49] what that God before the world had a
[1:26:57] plan and a purpose to make himself
[1:27:01] manifest not to pick a certain group of
[1:27:05] people but they'd be a group of people
[1:27:08] that would fulfill what He desires
[1:27:14] and it would be able to walk in his mind
[1:27:16] I preached a sermon here one day and on
[1:27:25] the Coppola years ago I preached on a
[1:27:31] word called Coppola and I brought it out
[1:27:34] and Coppola is a spherical dome and
[1:27:37] things like that setting on a
[1:27:38] weathervane sitting on the church etc
[1:27:40] etc well to show you how his mind works
[1:27:43] and you know I went home and I I
[1:27:46] speaking pretty good and I was sitting
[1:27:50] there cousin preach that night six
[1:27:52] o'clock and I said Lord that was a
[1:27:55] pretty good talk the way he was helping
[1:27:57] me to bring it out this morning I really
[1:28:00] enjoyed it and the spherical dome and I
[1:28:04] said you know we could be resurrected
[1:28:06] and sitting in heavenly places they
[1:28:08] that's kind of dome it's not not our
[1:28:10] Churchill I'm talking about the new
[1:28:11] Berkut Resurrection sitting in heavenly
[1:28:13] places in Christ Jesus that was
[1:28:16] wonderful thoughts your prophet brought
[1:28:17] and then you brought it to me and I
[1:28:19] brought it to the people it's about that
[1:28:22] time he said but that ain't what I'm
[1:28:25] talking about and I said hold on just a
[1:28:30] minute now
[1:28:31] something was talking and I knew better
[1:28:34] to argue what was talking but I knew I
[1:28:37] didn't understand what we're talking
[1:28:38] what being saying unless said Lord what
[1:28:41] do you mean he said that ain't what I
[1:28:43] was talking about
[1:28:44] I knew the brother that translated that
[1:28:49] worked for the voice of God recording we
[1:28:51] had 12 years of college I knew I
[1:28:52] couldn't argue
[1:28:53] intellectually with him I said well what
[1:28:58] do you mean Lord that all of that was
[1:29:02] good but he said no it's not what I'm
[1:29:05] talking about
[1:29:07] that's it okay I got to tell you I
[1:29:11] played it and every time he would come
[1:29:16] across you know everybody called it
[1:29:18] Coppola Coppola you know I listened
[1:29:24] and when he came down to it and that
[1:29:26] makes it he says he didn't say Coppola
[1:29:28] he said copula turning some cog wheels
[1:29:40] he never said Coppola he said copula I
[1:29:47] said well that's what can that fit with
[1:29:50] well it fits with the fact that he was
[1:29:53] talking about the head and body joining
[1:29:54] together because that was what he's
[1:29:57] talking about go check it into questions
[1:29:59] and answers and found that word Coppola
[1:30:02] if you can't I'll find it for you
[1:30:03] he was talking about head and body
[1:30:06] uniting to bring the message in the life
[1:30:11] stage so he wasn't saying Coppola like
[1:30:14] capping off so I got back and listened
[1:30:16] again I said okay now I'm getting some
[1:30:20] thoughts copula I said okay if he's head
[1:30:27] and body uniting together then but one
[1:30:29] word that I can do collation hidden body
[1:30:38] or not he was not talking about
[1:30:40] something up here to coming down he was
[1:30:42] talking about hidden body go get the
[1:30:45] message and read it head and body coming
[1:30:47] together
[1:30:48] copulation which is the same as husband
[1:30:51] and wife because that was what he was
[1:30:53] doing he's teaching us the Word of God
[1:30:56] and we're becoming one with that we were
[1:31:00] in the point of copulation the
[1:31:04] understanding of God's Word that is
[1:31:08] making us to be his children his
[1:31:10] offspring husband and wife head and body
[1:31:15] you not I come back crying priest
[1:31:20] another message enjoyed it well
[1:31:27] what do you think we all we need to do
[1:31:30] is one time listen to the word that's
[1:31:34] being brought to us and see if it's
[1:31:37] uniting us together with a headstone or
[1:31:42] see if it's driving us away you might
[1:31:46] see what's taking place you might see
[1:31:50] the bride in Christ becoming one and
[1:31:53] what did the Prophet say when the bride
[1:31:55] realized who she is and what she's your
[1:31:57] father
[1:31:58] he said she'll be an invincible army
[1:32:03] come on musicians what he is for
[1:32:07] knowledge the mind of God so in the mind
[1:32:11] of God we'll start from there and start
[1:32:15] bringing a world into existence bringing
[1:32:18] life into existence bringing man into
[1:32:20] existence and see his plan and his
[1:32:24] purpose think on these things let's
[1:32:30] stand together I hope you follow my
[1:32:34] point why do we want to go that away
[1:32:38] let's go back in his mind let's go back
[1:32:44] into his mind and see if we can come out
[1:32:51] of there with something better than to
[1:32:56] have a billionaire or a Destin he said
[1:33:02] then we can see that God does change his
[1:33:04] mind
[1:33:05] not change his mind not he was going to
[1:33:07] do this but he changes it and does this
[1:33:09] he knew before the world he was gonna do
[1:33:11] that I hope you follow that he knew
[1:33:15] before the world ever begun that he was
[1:33:17] gonna give that man 15 years so he
[1:33:19] didn't change his mind about his word he
[1:33:22] told him he's gonna die he gave him 15
[1:33:25] years he died he didn't change his mind
[1:33:29] He fulfilled his fine what do we got

[1:35:42] that reason
[1:35:43] Jacob had his eyes on that birthright
[1:35:46] that was all he wanted with the
[1:35:48] birthright because the birthright was a
[1:35:52] type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
