[30:16] two times you're part of us so that's
[30:18] just a the way we we make it just make
[30:21] yourself to home and remember now Wade
[30:24] is in Oklahoma preaching and we'll be
[30:27] try back tomorrow and then also remember
[30:31] Aaron is down preaching brother Collins
[30:34] today so remember that and also remember
[30:37] these brothers that are out ministering
[30:40] the gospel you know unto the Lord right
[30:43] I don't know where brother Dean's
[30:45] ministering is he is he ministering
[30:46] today somewhere Brothers his brothers
[30:49] his brothers okay he's had his brothers
[30:51] on
[30:53] so so just remember these okay let's
[30:56] turn to Ephesians 1 one where we've been
[30:58] reading for quite a while and then John
[31:01] 15 cuz that's the ones we've used the
[31:04] last couple of
[31:06] messages to uh to try to bring it out
[31:09] now we're going to be using the uh
[31:12] screen this morning so you will be doing
[31:15] it and some have said well they couldn't
[31:17] see you know that was the ones their
[31:19] eyesight was bad not the basics that you
[31:22] can't see from the back because
[31:23] everybody can pretty well see and uh but
[31:27] I will make those who cannot see each
[31:30] week you know a copy of the the quotes
[31:34] and things but uh what I want to do
[31:37] until I finish this series of what we're
[31:39] on right now I'm going to continue to
[31:42] give you the quotes cuz I want you to
[31:44] read and see that that's what brother
[31:46] randam said cuz you take it up here you
[31:48] can read it and that's well and good all
[31:51] right but you'll forget it you know and
[31:54] you'll say well I don't know what that
[31:55] is so this is this is a very very
[31:58] important series to me it's very very uh
[32:03] valuable I believe and like I said the
[32:05] other day if it gets boring to you then
[32:08] you don't know what I'm talking about
[32:10] that's as plain as any way of making it
[32:12] not sarcastic just plan telling the
[32:14] truth if you get bored to hear me talk
[32:16] about chosen in him then you wouldn't
[32:18] chosen in him cuz I really love to hear
[32:21] about water baptism it tickles me to
[32:23] death to hear Brother random talking
[32:24] about it and he seemed it didn't bother
[32:26] he get the seals and you know on
[32:28] questions and answers he'd still be on
[32:30] water baptism so you know just you know
[32:34] take that from me but we will try to get
[32:36] the point across as much as we can I did
[32:39] try another few little points on my wife
[32:42] again uh yesterday to see how things
[32:44] were going and and uh you know to kind
[32:47] of telling her the the future points of
[32:50] what I'm talk going to be talking about
[32:53] but let's go to Ephesians 1 and John 15
[32:56] father we thank you for for your love
[32:58] and your grace unto us we thank you for
[33:00] all things and we know you give them to
[33:02] us freely and we appreciate that and
[33:04] just bless and guide each one bless the
[33:06] minister brothers that are away today
[33:08] Wen Aaron and Brother Dean and way
[33:11] preaching we pray that you'd bless them
[33:12] and and be with them Lord and just let
[33:15] them bring forth Thy word unto the
[33:17] people and be with us here Lord as we
[33:19] speak about you come upon the seen in
[33:22] each one of our hearts and lives be in
[33:24] the speaker and the hearer that we may
[33:26] each one receive receive from you
[33:28] forgive our sins because we want to be
[33:31] cleansed Lord of all things all
[33:33] unrighteousness all thoughts and and
[33:36] meditations or anything that would be
[33:38] contrary to you we ask you to just
[33:40] cleanse them out of the way as we read
[33:42] your word you come and speak to our
[33:44] hearts guide us now and keep us Lord in
[33:47] Jesus name
[33:51] amen
[33:52] Ephesians 1 and brother Joe's putting
[33:55] them up for you there so they work out
[33:57] good
[33:59] verse three blessed be the God and
[34:01] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha
[34:02] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[34:05] in Heavenly places in Christ according
[34:09] as he had chosen Us in him before the
[34:12] foundation of the world that we should
[34:14] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[34:17] love now let's end there because we're
[34:20] staying remember in the thought back
[34:23] before the foundation of the world so if
[34:25] we go into predestination that's Destiny
[34:27] to determined down here so let's stop at
[34:29] that point now and go back to to uh John
[34:36] right John 15:15 henceforth I call you
[34:40] not servants for the servant knoweth not
[34:43] what his Lord doeth but I have called
[34:45] you friends for all things that I have
[34:47] heard of my father I have made known
[34:50] unto you you have not chosen me but I've
[34:54] have chosen you and ordained you that
[34:57] you should go forth and bring forth
[34:58] fruit and that your fruit should remain
[35:02] that whatsoever you shall ask of the
[35:04] father in my name he may give it you you
[35:08] may be seated the Lord at his Blessing
[35:11] to the reading of the
[35:13] word now as I said we'll be using both
[35:16] so we will be giving you the quotes and
[35:19] things and uh you know I I want to
[35:22] express something to you
[35:26] that you
[35:28] know maybe will help us you know we
[35:32] think
[35:34] that I know people say brother Dale's
[35:37] deep and we get into things it's hard to
[35:39] understand well U I thought that's the
[35:42] way the Bible was because I didn't know
[35:45] we could understand it in our human
[35:47] carnality I thought it took a revelation
[35:50] to understand but I'd like to ask you a
[35:53] question just a simple ordinary question
[35:58] now we know the disciples were tutored
[36:00] for three and 1/2 years
[36:04] right we can
[36:06] understand but on the day of Pentecost
[36:08] they heard one
[36:11] sermon and people that had maybe never
[36:15] heard
[36:16] of spoke
[36:19] to had any thoughts of Jesus
[36:24] Christ they come to Salvation
[36:29] by hearing one
[36:33] sermon now my point is is this a way we
[36:37] say that you know I you need to make it
[36:40] simple I agree with you but I'm going to
[36:43] say it the right way now you take it the
[36:45] right way I try my best to make it
[36:48] simple to those that are born
[36:53] again because you're the ones that needs
[36:56] it made simple
[37:00] I'm letting you think that thought
[37:03] over all
[37:04] right you say yeah but but it needs to
[37:07] be made simple to everybody we then you
[37:09] know what I try to make it simple to
[37:11] everybody but I'm just making a
[37:14] point what great thing or what what was
[37:18] it that triggered on the day of
[37:23] Pentecost when all they heard was a
[37:26] story that about a man
[37:29] dying and him being the Fulfillment of
[37:31] the scriptures they didn't have a
[37:34] background right come on get with me
[37:37] what my thought they didn't have any
[37:39] background right they hadn't heard a
[37:42] whole bunch of sermons The Disciples had
[37:43] heard him and they talked to the Lord
[37:47] Jesus they didn't know about Jesus
[37:50] Christ and
[37:54] salvation but when they heard a sermon
[37:59] they were pricked in their
[38:02] heart now one day we'll understand why
[38:06] the prophet of God would make it an
[38:10] emphatic or however how you say it
[38:11] definite thing to say that the seed has
[38:16] to come through the
[38:21] body right amen the seed has to come
[38:24] through the body amen
[38:27] and faith has to come by
[38:31] hearing right hearing how by the
[38:35] word all
[38:37] right now if that be true and we claim
[38:41] we believe
[38:44] it
[38:46] then could not a person be born again
[38:49] under the deepest teaching of the seals
[38:51] plagues vs trumpets anything marriage
[38:54] and divorce or whatever and then you'll
[38:57] understand why my brother
[38:59] brandham kept going on in the
[39:03] message deeper and deeper and deeper
[39:06] into the word and people were being
[39:12] converted
[39:14] right okay now are you listening yes
[39:18] see and I click off your computer about
[39:21] all the quotes and the things and listen
[39:22] to what I'm
[39:25] saying I know that offend somebody
[39:28] because you don't like to be told what
[39:29] to
[39:31] do
[39:33] but are you listening yes yes sir what
[39:37] simple sermon did the disciples
[39:41] preach that brought 3,000 people to the
[39:47] Lord and they only heard one sermon
[39:50] right how was it the Ethiopian unic he
[39:53] did have a little bit of an advantage
[39:55] because he was reading the Bible and we
[39:57] assume then that probably the 3,000 uh
[40:00] back there was in one way or the other
[40:03] in a religious point of hearing of God
[40:07] and maybe had heard about Jesus in some
[40:10] form or other but never met with him and
[40:14] all I'm just asking you a simple
[40:17] question what is
[40:20] deep that's right well I just don't
[40:23] understand it
[40:28] is that deep or is
[40:30] it because we don't have the
[40:33] understander amen inside of
[40:37] us or not now listen the people that
[40:41] heard the one message on the day of
[40:43] Pentecost they gave you a key to what
[40:46] happened
[40:48] there they were pricked in their
[40:53] heart that the scripture that's right
[40:57] now we ought to be able to understand
[40:59] why Jesus would say no man can come unto
[41:06] me I'll get to that after a while unless
[41:09] the father draws
[41:12] in amen is that
[41:15] scripture we quote them but do we you
[41:18] know and read them but do we really
[41:23] understand yes my brother D we believe
[41:25] in Salvation right sure we do
[41:27] right we do it's a
[41:29] blanket it's for everybody yes but we
[41:32] also know that everybody won't receive
[41:35] it it's not the fact that they don't
[41:37] hear it those that don't hear the gospel
[41:41] will have a greater opportunity at the
[41:44] day of judgment than those who have
[41:46] heard the gospel right you agree right
[41:50] because they will not have the
[41:52] responsibility only of their lives and
[41:54] their doings and the prophet said then
[41:57] they there'll be a people will be given
[41:59] eternal life that you know know nothing
[42:01] about Jesus Christ that's
[42:04] right I'm just asking you it's a simple
[42:07] thing because I know people have made
[42:09] one brother he made a point here and he
[42:12] preached a sermon one time and you know
[42:15] I enjoyed always did enjoyed his sermons
[42:17] but you know I thought he's trying to
[42:20] say something but I don't know what it
[42:22] is but any kept saying feed my sheep
[42:25] feed my sheep
[42:28] and they rocked home for about probably
[42:31] 5 years maybe and we were discussing
[42:34] something one day that he was getting on
[42:36] to me about something of being
[42:38] sadique and he said that's why I preach
[42:40] that message
[42:44] M I said oh about to feed the sheep he
[42:49] said yeah he said I wanted you to get
[42:52] off them deep things and feed my family
[42:57] now this happened
[43:02] SOC but you know what I thought then
[43:04] just like I do now why didn't he teach
[43:07] his family right if I was deep why
[43:11] didn't he teach his family right he was
[43:14] a minister why wasn't he teaching his
[43:16] family
[43:19] right I've try to teach my
[43:22] family the
[43:24] gospel but I just want to get that a
[43:26] point to you I want you to think about
[43:29] it cuz you think in the Bible I want you
[43:31] to read the Bible and when you're
[43:33] reading it think about
[43:35] it if it had not been for
[43:38] God quickening those people's heart
[43:42] about what was said on the day of
[43:45] Pentecost you know the the sermon of
[43:49] Peter and
[43:50] him then they would have been no 3,000
[43:53] converted right
[43:59] so we look at it you know I like what
[44:01] brother Ram said one time he said I like
[44:02] for God to work on both ends you
[44:05] remember that work on both ends you know
[44:08] working on the person working on the
[44:09] person then you can see people can be
[44:12] saved if you're preaching the
[44:15] seals the plagues the vows the trumpets
[44:19] as you call the Deep
[44:22] things I wish we would get that away
[44:24] from our understanding if God doesn't
[44:27] Quicken anything there's no way for you
[44:29] to be saved
[44:30] anyway if God never chose you then
[44:33] you're not going to be chosen you say
[44:35] that's predestination without a choice
[44:38] no I've been preaching it God gives you
[44:41] a choice that's
[44:44] right but I want you to think on that
[44:48] maybe you'll get away from thinking
[44:49] about deep things and get around to
[44:51] thinking about simple things you know
[44:53] what deep things are to me is the most
[44:55] simple things there are in the world
[44:56] that that's what's
[44:58] deep
[45:00] right how that we were chosen in
[45:03] him he said I can't understand that you
[45:07] know why you can't understand
[45:09] it because it hasn't been made alive to
[45:12] you right it hasn't been quickened to
[45:15] you it hasn't been revealed to you it's
[45:18] a good quote you remember a few weeks or
[45:21] so ago and I talking about the Bible
[45:22] says we're just by being in Jesus Christ
[45:24] we're just as righteous as God is but
[45:27] has that been revealed or is that just a
[45:32] quote if it's a quote it's deep
[45:36] things if it's
[45:38] revealed I thought we believe that God
[45:41] was hidden and revealed were simp in
[45:48] simplicity so then ask for God to reveal
[45:51] to you what I'm talking about when I'm
[45:53] speaking to you or anyone else right
[45:56] because he doesn't reveal it we won't
[45:58] get to
[45:59] [Music]
[46:01] point but you just think about it you go
[46:03] back go back to the prophet's message go
[46:05] back to all the other and look at the
[46:07] things that he would be preaching and
[46:09] people come to the altar to be
[46:13] saved I'm tried my best to tell you what
[46:15] the prophet said one day that a preacher
[46:17] has nothing but a gift to be able to
[46:20] break Satan's spell over your eyes that
[46:22] God may be speaking can speak to you
[46:25] that's sure he must preach it correctly
[46:27] he must bring it correctly Etc we know
[46:30] that all right but all that I do is try
[46:34] to break that spell say ain't no spell
[46:36] on my eyes with you the one that's got
[46:38] it right
[46:40] simple you're the one that's got the
[46:42] spell over your eyes cuz you're missing
[46:44] the whole point this message was not
[46:47] brought to be uh deck things quotes and
[46:50] show how much intelligence we have and
[46:53] how we can out quote everybody else and
[46:55] how we can use the Great swelling word
[46:57] theop is and all of this that logos and
[47:00] and just make everybody think we know
[47:02] all about what we're talking about it
[47:03] was made to be revealed and
[47:08] lived that's right that's what it's made
[47:11] for that's right to be revealed to us
[47:14] that we could live
[47:16] it that's
[47:19] Simplicity all right so think on that
[47:22] now so then maybe it'll take away from
[47:24] the thoughts of people's mind that you
[47:26] know you need to preach simple things to
[47:28] the
[47:31] children you'd be surprised that these
[47:33] children are understanding sometimes
[47:35] better than you are that's right that's
[47:38] you want to get upset with me for
[47:40] talking like that go right
[47:42] ahead but if you get upset with me for
[47:44] saying it then you know for sure that
[47:45] you're the one I'm talking
[47:50] about it's not because their mind is so
[47:53] sharp it's because that they believe it
[47:57] you know children will believe what you
[48:01] say so be careful what you say to
[48:06] them they will believe
[48:10] it why can't we believe
[48:15] it see Faith truly then comes by hearing
[48:18] and hearing by the word right
[48:21] amen so then it order bring us to a
[48:24] place of understanding okay now I just
[48:26] that's been on my mind for quite a while
[48:28] of thinking and and I wanted to just get
[48:30] it off to the basis of getting
[48:33] understanding to
[48:34] you that we call things deep when it
[48:38] means it's simply not been revealed
[48:40] right when you say that's deep that
[48:43] means it's not been revealed to you is
[48:46] that simple
[48:47] enough but that hurts your feelings
[48:49] doesn't it well I'm sorry but truth is
[48:54] trth as I say again what great what
[48:57] great thing read the read the the the
[49:00] the book of Acts there where that before
[49:04] the Holy Ghost fell on the 3000 read it
[49:07] to me and give me a simple sermon out of
[49:09] it here's a man telling people about
[49:12] somebody they know nothing about
[49:14] probably a lot of them knew nothing
[49:16] about Jesus
[49:20] right you know it's not that they heard
[49:22] three years like the others they heard
[49:24] nothing nothing about Jesus
[49:29] see what you're making it is that we're
[49:31] to take the people and sit down and
[49:33] train them to be able to
[49:34] believe now that would do away with
[49:37] God's
[49:42] calling that would not be the father
[49:44] calling that would be you calling them
[49:46] with
[49:48] words and see then you you get offended
[49:51] at me for saying but I try to make it as
[49:53] simple as I possibly can
[49:58] because we've been doing this for 40
[50:00] something years and I've been preaching
[50:02] and go back with Brother Ray and ask him
[50:03] and sit down and he can tell you where I
[50:05] was preaching this 20 years ago that's
[50:07] right CU he's taking them off and put
[50:09] them into where that you have the
[50:10] ability and if you want to go back and
[50:11] do it and like I've always said I I'd
[50:14] make the takes for two purposes one for
[50:16] you to take home and listen to and one
[50:19] for us to keep it where you come up and
[50:20] you say brother Dale you said so and so
[50:24] you changed your Doctrine I said show me
[50:27] that's right well I heard
[50:30] you I told a brother one
[50:33] day he said you said so I said no I
[50:36] didn't I said if I did my mind was out
[50:38] of it I didn't mean it that way but I
[50:40] said I don't think I said
[50:42] it yes he did I said well let's go get
[50:44] the
[50:46] tape we'll play the tape and see whether
[50:50] I said it or not well you know what that
[50:52] that generally kills people they don't
[50:54] want to cuz they want to go away
[50:57] thinking well I still believe he said it
[51:00] but I'm just not going to argue with him
[51:02] anymore he's sarcastic arguing and
[51:05] hateful ain't arguing and hateful I well
[51:07] go listen to the T see if I said if I
[51:10] did I come to the church
[51:14] repent all right see that's what we
[51:16] ought to
[51:17] be well all right now let's get into
[51:20] what we're talking about
[51:21] today now we've been we covered the last
[51:24] message
[51:27] that you know we were The Offspring of
[51:30] God as Paul
[51:32] said The Offspring of
[51:34] God you remember that now what is an
[51:38] offspring an offspring is in the natural
[51:42] is you are an offspring of your mother
[51:44] and father you know that you come into
[51:46] the world but in the spiritual you're
[51:50] your mother is God and your father is
[51:52] God so you're not dealing with that form
[51:56] you're dealing with whether or not
[51:58] you're born again CU if you're born
[52:00] again then you prove what you was and
[52:03] remember now what we're trying to do
[52:05] we're trying to stay back up I haven't
[52:07] brought it down to earth yet when we get
[52:09] to earth we'll start dealing with
[52:10] predestination for knowledges and you
[52:13] choosing and and all cuz I believe in
[52:15] never been of that there's a couple of
[52:17] quotes in here that I gave you where
[52:18] brother R said see you chose you call
[52:21] you you you know you accepted it you got
[52:24] to see we we run that in the ground
[52:26] where we say well brother brandom said
[52:29] no man sought
[52:30] god well what do you
[52:35] mean well I mean nobody sought
[52:39] him would you didn't cry and pray and
[52:42] seek God you didn't repent of your
[52:47] sins come on you didn't repent of your
[52:49] sins then you're not saved simple amen
[52:53] plain language you're not saved right
[52:56] cuz if you don't repent of your sins how
[52:57] could you have eternal
[53:01] life come on see we we think we know
[53:03] what we're talking about but then when
[53:05] it's faced by the word that someone does
[53:07] know what they're talking about then
[53:09] well I'm not going to
[53:10] argue ain't no argument to it right
[53:13] takes two side to argue you ain't got
[53:16] one that's being sarcastic no been
[53:19] true amen if you had to repented God
[53:23] wouldn't give you the Holy Ghost come on
[53:25] Amen on that but see he knew your choice
[53:30] right he knew You' choose him we'll get
[53:33] to that on down into to where we call it
[53:35] over into time but now we're trying to
[53:37] stay back before the Earth before the
[53:39] world to see whatever was back there or
[53:41] what went on or or you know whatever
[53:44] we're doing I'll tell you when we drop
[53:47] down to
[53:49] earth you remember we were talking about
[53:52] that we were The Offspring of
[53:54] God and we've been dealing with that we
[53:56] were chosen the scripture says in him
[54:00] and we read where Jesus said there in
[54:02] the gospels John 14 uh John
[54:06] 1516 you didn't choose me I chose you
[54:11] that's right before the
[54:13] world Jeremiah I chose you to be a
[54:18] prophet
[54:19] right before the world well did Jeremiah
[54:23] have anything to do with life he did
[54:25] actually got here
[54:28] but I've got a quote in here that we'll
[54:30] get to it in a minute where the Prophet
[54:32] said this that we're talking about was
[54:36] billions of trillions of trillions and
[54:39] millions of
[54:41] years before the world ever
[54:44] begun he said then how could you choose
[54:47] now that's
[54:50] simple that's as simple as anything
[54:53] could be he said how could you choose
[54:55] that's right
[54:57] well now what it is he saw my choice
[54:59] well I've done covered that and I'll go
[55:01] back to it
[55:02] again if he saw your choice then you
[55:06] chose
[55:09] right
[55:11] okay but if it was billions of billions
[55:13] of years ago you wasn't there to make a
[55:17] choice as a human mortal or being or
[55:20] whatever you had to be part of that
[55:22] eternal life amen and if you was not not
[55:26] part of that eternal life you never will
[55:28] be part of that eternal
[55:30] life see that's as simple as we've been
[55:32] trying to make it see but now our study
[55:35] is back
[55:38] DIY but what we're trying to cover is
[55:41] what was our existed or whatever
[55:43] happened before the world now the Lord
[55:47] willing maybe Wednesday night we'll get
[55:48] into where the Morning Star saying
[55:50] together and the sons of God shouted for
[55:52] Joy but just remember if that was a not
[55:56] a reality it never will happen on
[55:59] Earth because listen I'm giving you the
[56:02] key the same
[56:05] scripture that said he
[56:08] was crucified before the world is the
[56:11] same scripture that said you shout
[56:15] it okay that's right see that's
[56:22] simple but see know you want to make one
[56:24] this way and one that way no simple if
[56:27] it says it it says it we'll get to that
[56:28] in a minute cuz that's the point of want
[56:30] you don't get anything out of the whole
[56:32] day of one thing I want to drive the
[56:34] point to you and I that God's word is
[56:37] eternal and that his thoughts are
[56:39] Eternal and he can never have another
[56:41] thought and we've got to be those
[56:42] attributes if we're not those attributes
[56:44] we never will be the attributes
[56:47] right right that's all I want to tell
[56:49] you so if you missed the whole sleep to
[56:51] or whatever you turn off your computer
[56:52] and get upset with me and just go on I
[56:54] can't help it cuz I can't can't control
[56:56] you right all
[56:59] right now this is before we start our
[57:02] Earthly journey of anything whatsoever
[57:05] so now let's start out let's see what
[57:08] the scriptures the scripture there the
[57:10] prophet gave I mean the scripture we
[57:12] read said we were chosen in
[57:15] him now you remember what I've been
[57:17] trying to make the point it's not that
[57:19] we were chosen by him right that comes
[57:22] on over into
[57:25] life we were not chosen you know by him
[57:29] or anything like that because if it was
[57:31] that that deals over
[57:33] here but we were chosen in him right see
[57:40] then if we can find where we were at
[57:42] diary remember I kept asking the
[57:44] question in one service about
[57:46] it who's the
[57:49] hym the Bible said we were chosen in him
[57:52] who's the himy all right so we know and
[57:55] for sure and see it's the
[57:59] Christ right and that's how that we
[58:02] would be in Jesus Christ to walk the
[58:05] shores of Galilee right not as little
[58:08] bitty identities running around in the
[58:11] body but it to be in that eternal life
[58:13] that he had within
[58:15] him all right so now we know who the HM
[58:18] is it's
[58:22] Christ now who done the choosing
[58:31] we're not
[58:32] trinitarians we don't believe in two
[58:35] Gods but we believe God can show himself
[58:39] in many forms or many
[58:43] ways he can make himself
[58:45] manifest and what people don't want to
[58:48] believe is in how that one form of God
[58:50] can communicate with another form of God
[58:53] that's that's the hardest thing
[58:54] seemingly here to get across to you
[58:57] cuz you just what do you mean if there's
[58:59] a God here and a god there that's two of
[59:00] them you know no that's
[59:05] not you ever talk to
[59:10] yourself
[59:13] oh who are you talk
[59:16] to come on you talk to
[59:20] yourself like one brother said said only
[59:23] the time that I can figure I'm caring on
[59:25] an intelligent conversations when I'm
[59:26] talking to
[59:30] myself now talking to
[59:33] yourself you ever answer your own
[59:39] questions
[59:41] oh we're getting down where we
[59:45] live now that's how simple the gospel
[59:50] is now let me give you another one and
[59:52] we'll break it on down a little further
[59:56] okay
[59:58] now brother collie you believe you have
[1:00:01] eternal life don't you okay brother dick
[1:00:05] you believe you have eternal
[1:00:08] life do you ever talk to brother colie
[1:00:10] or brother colie ever talked to
[1:00:16] you what do you mean both of you got the
[1:00:19] same eternal
[1:00:21] life but you know you don't have all of
[1:00:24] it
[1:00:26] right so you know that within the other
[1:00:29] person is part of
[1:00:31] God Amen so you can talk to each
[1:00:35] other right amen that simple
[1:00:40] illustrations we're talking about
[1:00:42] almighty God not a peanut brain outfit
[1:00:44] that you and I used to think he
[1:00:47] was we're talking about the great
[1:00:50] Eternal that never had another thought
[1:00:53] he cannot have another thought he cannot
[1:00:55] think another thought you know in any
[1:00:59] way that would change any thought he had
[1:01:03] he never changes his mind he doesn't do
[1:01:05] anything like
[1:01:06] that well we got no you got the message
[1:01:09] too he didn't change his mind that's
[1:01:11] right he gave the man 15 years he didn't
[1:01:13] change his mind he knew he was going to
[1:01:15] give him that for a man ever asked for
[1:01:18] it and the man died cuz that's what he
[1:01:22] was told sit your house in order you'll
[1:01:25] die right and he did die right right
[1:01:29] after the 15 years amen see that's
[1:01:33] simple see we going to be far enough in
[1:01:35] the message now to be able to talk about
[1:01:37] these
[1:01:39] things and I'm telling you that that
[1:01:41] it's 40 something years of me
[1:01:47] preaching and God is unveiling now
[1:01:49] things to me that I had questions
[1:01:52] about for 40 something years
[1:01:56] and would not dare try to express what I
[1:02:00] believed because I did not see the end
[1:02:02] of
[1:02:04] it if I don't see the end of something
[1:02:07] then I I can't preach it to you because
[1:02:09] that means I don't understand it so I'll
[1:02:12] just wait but once I start on it and see
[1:02:14] it then you know for sure we're going
[1:02:19] somewhere if I didn't know the answer to
[1:02:22] two or three questions in this message I
[1:02:24] would just call in somebody have to let
[1:02:27] them preach and forget
[1:02:31] it but the Lord keeps unfolding it to
[1:02:35] me now
[1:02:40] listen the thoughts of
[1:02:44] God are
[1:02:49] Eternal can never have a new thought
[1:02:52] that's right amen can't change his mind
[1:02:55] amen
[1:02:56] can't say he was wrong cuz he never
[1:03:03] was his thoughts are
[1:03:05] Eternal that's why you've always heard
[1:03:07] me say
[1:03:09] what what is one of my favorite
[1:03:12] saying I don't want to be in the mind of
[1:03:15] God because everybody is in the mind of
[1:03:18] God Judas is car was in the mind of God
[1:03:22] the Bible spoke of him coming and the
[1:03:24] things happening before he got
[1:03:26] here but that doesn't make Judas
[1:03:30] Eternal right I don't want to be in the
[1:03:34] mind of
[1:03:36] God I like to think that he thought of
[1:03:38] me that's all right you
[1:03:40] know but I want to be a part of his mind
[1:03:45] that's right
[1:03:47] amen so when we're dealing with
[1:03:52] thoughts now remember the Bible I didn't
[1:03:55] bring these with me because you surely
[1:03:57] you should know it but what is it in
[1:03:59] Isaiah where he said my thoughts are not
[1:04:01] your thoughts my ways are not your ways
[1:04:05] my thoughts are so much beyond your
[1:04:07] thoughts until your thoughts in other
[1:04:08] words paraphrasing what I'm saying
[1:04:11] they're not even in considered brother
[1:04:14] kie preached that years about 30
[1:04:16] something years ago he thinks I can't
[1:04:18] remember but I
[1:04:21] do he used to call it Thro I remember
[1:04:25] that
[1:04:26] I'm not making fun of his words I'm just
[1:04:28] telling you I can
[1:04:30] remember but now
[1:04:32] listen what about those
[1:04:36] thoughts well brother Dale you don't
[1:04:38] understand predestination and things
[1:04:40] it's just that that we were just in
[1:04:41] God's mind and he just thought of
[1:04:46] us now how can you bring eternal life
[1:04:48] that
[1:04:54] way come on you you you can't bring ET
[1:04:57] eternal life to a mortal being by your
[1:04:58] concept of that
[1:05:03] point you going to have change
[1:05:06] somewhere of you're thinking because you
[1:05:08] would only be dealing with what you know
[1:05:10] well I'm sure I'm glad I done something
[1:05:12] or didn't do something and God saved me
[1:05:14] then where's Abraham's unconditional
[1:05:19] Covenant why you just don't understand
[1:05:21] God knew Abraham would believe him I
[1:05:24] know that too
[1:05:28] but I know he gave him an unconditional
[1:05:33] Covenant and I know that he gave all the
[1:05:35] Seed of Abraham that same unconditional
[1:05:39] Covenant
[1:05:40] amen well then I'll just go out and live
[1:05:42] like the devil well then go ahead cuz
[1:05:44] you prove you're not a Seed of Abraham
[1:05:46] cuz Abraham done what God God knew what
[1:05:49] Abraham would do right and Abraham done
[1:05:52] it but he had a choice in doing it
[1:05:56] that's why when we get there there
[1:05:58] there's things in this life if we don't
[1:06:00] correct them here we're going to have to
[1:06:02] answer for them there it won't be a
[1:06:04] decision of whether we're going to
[1:06:06] heaven or not no it be the decision upon
[1:06:09] the basis of of
[1:06:12] rewards we don't have to stand before
[1:06:14] the white Throne judgment we sit on the
[1:06:16] Judgment seat judging the
[1:06:19] others but the Bible also speaks of a
[1:06:22] judgment of the Deeds Done in the body
[1:06:24] whether good or bad we don't make right
[1:06:25] here we got to answer some word that's
[1:06:28] right amen he said well then how's it
[1:06:32] unconditional well it's unconditional
[1:06:34] cuz he ain't going to send you to hell
[1:06:35] cuz you
[1:06:38] done but you're going to give an
[1:06:43] account all
[1:06:46] right now listen to what your Prophet
[1:06:48] had to say this is Page 150 of the
[1:06:50] church age book which is really soar in
[1:06:52] church
[1:06:53] age and brother Joe tries to give you
[1:06:56] this what I I do and and everything but
[1:06:59] you read the whole thing is read I'm
[1:07:00] going to give them to you until I finish
[1:07:02] this God I want you to to know brother
[1:07:04] random said these things I don't mean to
[1:07:07] just put it up here and it be something
[1:07:09] that you read it and didn't understand I
[1:07:11] want you to have in your possession then
[1:07:12] you can't argue the
[1:07:14] point you can't say I didn't have an
[1:07:16] opportunity so look what brother around
[1:07:18] said he's talking about his substance
[1:07:21] and things you know from Psalms 139 15-
[1:07:24] 16 about my substance was not hid from
[1:07:27] thee when I was made in secret and
[1:07:29] ciously WR in the lower parts of the
[1:07:30] earth th eyes did see my substance yet
[1:07:33] being unperfect and in thy book were all
[1:07:35] my members written which in continuance
[1:07:38] was fashioned were fashioned when as yet
[1:07:42] there was none of them now watch it that
[1:07:45] as I said was not written about
[1:07:48] Adam another words it this wasn't
[1:07:50] written about
[1:07:53] Adam right it was written about the
[1:07:56] spiritual seed it was written about the
[1:08:00] the ones who would receive eternal life
[1:08:03] am so it wasn't just written about Adam
[1:08:05] but you use an Adam as an example all
[1:08:07] right watch
[1:08:09] it was not written about Adam but it
[1:08:13] gives you the idea and knowledge that
[1:08:15] the thought was Dire in his mind and
[1:08:18] that thought was eternal and had to be
[1:08:23] expressed it had to be expressed
[1:08:25] so when Adam was formed to the dust of
[1:08:27] the earth and his spiritual being
[1:08:29] created by God then Adam became God's
[1:08:31] thought Express and those Eternal
[1:08:34] thoughts were now
[1:08:39] manifested was there any way to change
[1:08:43] the situation of
[1:08:45] Adam
[1:08:49] no now we get to it where that you
[1:08:52] you've got to consider what I'm saying
[1:08:54] Adam didn't have a choice
[1:08:59] when Adam took a choice he felled right
[1:09:03] agree but he didn't have a choice how he
[1:09:05] got
[1:09:07] here amen he didn't have a choice of
[1:09:10] being what he was that's
[1:09:13] right because God started you that way
[1:09:16] that's right right he had to start it
[1:09:21] perfect and Adam had eternal life in his
[1:09:23] soul
[1:09:26] but now his body and spirit was not
[1:09:31] Eternal that's
[1:09:33] right but see
[1:09:35] Adam wasn't given a
[1:09:39] choice he never had a choice of whether
[1:09:42] he was going to have Eve or
[1:09:45] not come
[1:09:48] on see the eternal life was not on the
[1:09:51] basis of anything Adam would be doing or
[1:09:53] not doing it was on impartation from
[1:09:59] God he never had a choice about his wife
[1:10:03] he didn't get to
[1:10:06] choose God gave him a
[1:10:09] wife of God's
[1:10:13] choosing but knowing see we'll have to
[1:10:15] come back to these later when we get
[1:10:17] over on this sidey but knowing that they
[1:10:19] would
[1:10:22] fall once he gave them a choice
[1:10:28] so we better deal with that choice one
[1:10:29] of these days
[1:10:31] right God knew if he ever put man here
[1:10:35] even giving eternal life in the
[1:10:41] soul that they would
[1:10:44] fall right now you can argue about Eve
[1:10:46] all you want too I just tell you what I
[1:10:48] believe I believe she was in Adam and
[1:10:49] theop because that's what brother random
[1:10:51] said in theop is a soul so I believe Eve
[1:10:53] had eternal life in her soul
[1:10:55] right so you want to make I know the
[1:10:57] point you want to make Adam with some
[1:10:58] great something but Eve just just
[1:11:00] garbage can you no Perfect Right
[1:11:07] perfect but God
[1:11:09] knew she'd make a
[1:11:12] choice and then Adam would follow her
[1:11:16] choice and the fall would take place
[1:11:18] we'll get back to
[1:11:22] that but remember Adam was was not
[1:11:25] Eternal in
[1:11:27] body his body was a creation yes he only
[1:11:32] had eternal life in his soul that's
[1:11:34] blasphemous names read the
[1:11:40] prophet his body was not Eternal there's
[1:11:43] where the problem was right had there
[1:11:46] not been a
[1:11:47] fall which we know could not be because
[1:11:51] God had attributes in him right but had
[1:11:55] there not been a
[1:11:57] fall then it wouldn't have been a
[1:12:00] devil
[1:12:02] okay you know if it was going to be that
[1:12:04] there wasn't going to be no fou it
[1:12:05] wasn't going to be no
[1:12:07] devil there wasn't going to be no
[1:12:09] problems it would have just been there
[1:12:11] it was been Adam and Eve and all they
[1:12:13] had to do would just go to the tree of
[1:12:15] life and eat the tree of life and their
[1:12:17] bodies would have been made Eternal
[1:12:19] simple simple language simple point and
[1:12:23] they would have brought us here you can
[1:12:24] argue all you want to up and down they
[1:12:26] do in the message whether that would be
[1:12:27] spoken word children or where it would
[1:12:29] be by sex that we were brought or
[1:12:31] whatever you just argue all you want to
[1:12:32] ain't concerned about I just know for
[1:12:35] certain we didn't come that way that's
[1:12:37] right but had God brought us that way
[1:12:40] they would have not been a fall you go
[1:12:41] along with it that been no fall it would
[1:12:44] have been no devil it would have been no
[1:12:46] curse wouldn't have been no problem but
[1:12:48] God could not have displayed all of his
[1:12:50] attributes
[1:12:55] you say well how would it been some way
[1:12:57] we would have come then we would have
[1:12:59] all went to the tree of life and our
[1:13:01] bodies would have been made Eternal and
[1:13:02] everything would have been okay now you
[1:13:04] tell me that's not exactly what's taking
[1:13:06] place I want you to sit down and discuss
[1:13:08] that with me sometime that's exactly
[1:13:10] what's taking place we fail we came here
[1:13:12] but we come to Jesus Christ in the soul
[1:13:14] to make the the soul Eternal and then
[1:13:16] we're going to the tree of life which is
[1:13:18] the word which will eventually change
[1:13:20] these bodies so the ultimate end of of
[1:13:22] the way God's doing it don't make no
[1:13:24] difference he's going to bring it the
[1:13:26] way he
[1:13:27] wants all
[1:13:29] right but you
[1:13:31] see Adam and Eve
[1:13:34] beautiful but yet they
[1:13:37] sinned don't you know that was God's
[1:13:41] thought now don't you think that God
[1:13:44] knew that if he allowed us to come we
[1:13:46] would fall now here's one thing I want
[1:13:48] to get across to you but I'm I want to
[1:13:49] make sure you understand it this is one
[1:13:51] of the things I was covered with my wife
[1:13:53] yesterday I want to make sure you
[1:13:54] understand understand this you know the
[1:13:57] way brother Dale lives and what he
[1:13:58] believes your children know that you
[1:14:02] know I don't believe in living like a
[1:14:03] garbage
[1:14:04] can you've been around me you know
[1:14:09] that but don't you ever get in your mind
[1:14:12] adults especially cuz the children won't
[1:14:14] even ever get it there don't you adults
[1:14:16] ever get into your mind that you can't
[1:14:18] do
[1:14:19] wrong just because you're born
[1:14:22] again don't you do it cuz you're right
[1:14:25] in the devil's trap when you think you
[1:14:27] can't do wrong cuz you got the new birth
[1:14:29] you are lost in out of the word of God
[1:14:31] is the best way for me to say
[1:14:33] it now that don't justify us doing wrong
[1:14:38] I said it while ago there's going to be
[1:14:41] a judgment of Deeds Done in the body
[1:14:42] whether good or bad if we don't repent
[1:14:44] of them here we're going to face things
[1:14:45] that in the world to come amen not a
[1:14:48] choice of eternal life I keep saying
[1:14:50] that but the fact that we won't repent
[1:14:53] on this Earth
[1:14:56] but you see we we want to make it you
[1:14:58] listen to the preachers preach and they
[1:14:59] say oh bless God when you get that Holy
[1:15:02] Ghost there just no way for you to do
[1:15:04] wrong now show me that in the Bible
[1:15:07] that's
[1:15:10] right well you just don't believe in the
[1:15:12] Holy Ghost being able to keep
[1:15:17] you you better think things over
[1:15:21] right it would sound like that I would
[1:15:23] be saying that it doesn't matter what
[1:15:25] you do no I didn't say
[1:15:29] that you kids these kids understand me
[1:15:32] they know I'm not talking like that so
[1:15:33] it's adults that I'm talking to
[1:15:36] right see we are capable of
[1:15:41] sinning oh that the seed cannot sin
[1:15:45] that's the seed that's inside of there
[1:15:46] that's the new birth it can't
[1:15:49] sin but this body and spirit that I'm
[1:15:51] dwelling in can still do wrong
[1:15:55] you better keep it under subjection to
[1:15:56] the Holy Spirit that's within
[1:16:00] you cuz not you'll be running out here
[1:16:02] and saying it don't it don't bother me
[1:16:04] I'll go down to the beard store and get
[1:16:06] me some beer I'll go down to The Honky
[1:16:07] TS and hang around cuz it don't bother
[1:16:09] me now you lying hypocrite of a devil
[1:16:13] how much stronger can I make it that's
[1:16:15] right that's right don't ever get the
[1:16:16] idea that you can get by with anything
[1:16:18] that's right amen you better keep the
[1:16:20] idea of repenting amen
[1:16:25] brother randam said they said he said do
[1:16:27] you sin brother Ram he said every
[1:16:30] day now this his words well he didn't
[1:16:34] really mean
[1:16:35] that well you argue with God about it
[1:16:39] I'm just trying to make a
[1:16:40] point don't ever think this because you
[1:16:43] have eternal life that you can't make a
[1:16:44] mistake and do
[1:16:46] wrong don't think that you can't do
[1:16:49] wrong with the new birth inside of you
[1:16:51] that's right
[1:16:55] now the new birth inside of you will
[1:16:57] make you then repent yes when you do the
[1:17:00] wrong if not then the Holy Ghost is not
[1:17:01] there simple
[1:17:03] enough but it doesn't keep us from doing
[1:17:05] wrong we're human Mortals living in a
[1:17:08] world of mortality as you want to call
[1:17:09] it
[1:17:13] whatever I'm just trying to be straight
[1:17:15] and
[1:17:17] honest see to keep us from falling off
[1:17:19] into the wrong thing to think about it
[1:17:25] and to see that God really chose us back
[1:17:28] there thank you
[1:17:32] Jesus follow that thought of what I'm
[1:17:35] talking
[1:17:36] about don't go out and just do wrong and
[1:17:39] say Well it don't matter I'm
[1:17:41] Christian now you're
[1:17:44] lost you remember the man in the Hebrew
[1:17:48] series had a guy to go out and there
[1:17:50] wanted somebody to go get him some beer
[1:17:51] as a preacher and he quit you know he
[1:17:53] said if I was a Christian and I wouldn't
[1:17:55] be preach I wouldn't be doing this but
[1:17:57] brother Brown said it was his child
[1:17:59] that's right but he said he took him
[1:18:01] home because he couldn't Mar his
[1:18:05] name the man wouldn't repent so he had
[1:18:08] to go
[1:18:09] home amen the Bible says some men sins
[1:18:13] go before them and some follow after if
[1:18:16] we repent they go before us and hit the
[1:18:18] blood and they're gone but if they
[1:18:19] follow after us we're going to have to
[1:18:21] give an account somewhere
[1:18:25] not a decision of eternal life no but
[1:18:28] now listen my Point's always been if we
[1:18:30] have eternal life why wouldn't we want
[1:18:32] to be right why wouldn't we want to
[1:18:33] repent I mean what's wrong why wouldn't
[1:18:35] we want to be
[1:18:38] right that's what the people of the
[1:18:40] world look at us and they see the
[1:18:42] garbage can of this
[1:18:45] message the polygamy and the hookies and
[1:18:47] all kind of things that in the Mage all
[1:18:50] around but yet
[1:18:55] and that's what's going to bring the the
[1:18:56] the things down on
[1:18:59] us but I don't blame the government for
[1:19:02] closing out it like I've always told you
[1:19:04] you let me find one of you guilty of of
[1:19:07] molesting a child or doing something
[1:19:08] like that I'll be the one that take you
[1:19:10] to court and I know the quotes from
[1:19:12] brother
[1:19:14] brownon he wouldn't turn in them people
[1:19:16] that was Crooks and things he said
[1:19:19] that's not my job that's up to the law
[1:19:21] you want that quote
[1:19:24] don't you think he knew what was going
[1:19:26] on but there are some things that man
[1:19:29] wouldn't have put up with and neither
[1:19:30] will I
[1:19:32] amen because we're try to do honest to
[1:19:35] be straight now forgive me lost 30
[1:19:37] minutes to 45 talking to you all right
[1:19:41] but now
[1:19:42] listen now we know for
[1:19:47] assurity that God's thoughts are
[1:19:51] Eternal all right now I just want to
[1:19:53] read that and go down to a little bit
[1:19:55] with you and just remember
[1:19:58] now what he thinks of is not necessarily
[1:20:04] Eternal right he thought of Judas he
[1:20:06] thought of Hitler he thought of
[1:20:07] everybody he thought of the the whole
[1:20:09] world he thought of all of the people
[1:20:10] Etc what would be it doesn't make it
[1:20:13] Eternal you must receive eternal life to
[1:20:16] have eternal
[1:20:18] life but remember now and we'll try to
[1:20:21] get this point in heavily the prophet
[1:20:24] said it's not not the person that comes
[1:20:25] predestinated eternally from God 154
[1:20:28] Church age book I didn't give you that
[1:20:29] one but you ought to remember it he said
[1:20:32] it's not the person that comes
[1:20:33] predestinated eternally from God he said
[1:20:35] it's the seed our
[1:20:37] word
[1:20:40] right now who was it when he was talking
[1:20:43] about Jeremiah that I knew you and
[1:20:45] ordained you to be a prophet before the
[1:20:47] world gifts and callings are without
[1:20:51] repentance that's right but you know you
[1:20:54] can have gifts you could have all of the
[1:20:56] nine spiritual gifts and be lost that's
[1:21:00] right that's another thing people don't
[1:21:03] like for you to talk about well look at
[1:21:05] so they have gifts why do that matter
[1:21:08] gifts some colge or
[1:21:11] without you can have all the gifts and
[1:21:14] still be lost but you can't have the
[1:21:16] giver and be lost I don't I want the
[1:21:19] giver with the giver comes the
[1:21:21] gift but gifts without the giver is just
[1:21:24] a g can that's right
[1:21:28] amen I was called to preach before the
[1:21:31] world ever
[1:21:35] begun cuz that's a
[1:21:38] gift now there was a day when the man
[1:21:40] here you're looking at didn't believe
[1:21:42] that
[1:21:45] call but then I see what a call to the
[1:21:48] ministry is and it's not a rooster up in
[1:21:49] a tree cow her mama calls daddy scent
[1:21:52] businesses right
[1:21:55] well I just feel like ought to preach go
[1:21:58] sit down and listen for a while and find
[1:21:59] out what you're going to preach when you
[1:22:01] do
[1:22:01] preach that's what I told Wade right
[1:22:04] that's right y I told him I said don't
[1:22:06] you run with it you you sat down and
[1:22:08] wait till God runs you and he can't you
[1:22:11] can't run no further than you get up and
[1:22:13] go
[1:22:15] preach but the prophet of God said a man
[1:22:19] had volunteers himself God can't use him
[1:22:21] right now he didn't say God couldn't use
[1:22:23] him to make speed and get other people
[1:22:25] converted he didn't say that he just
[1:22:27] can't use him to bring the
[1:22:30] word you see why I around the message
[1:22:33] then they're not bringing the word
[1:22:37] that's just as plain as can be that's
[1:22:38] all right with me I'm not trying to make
[1:22:41] nothing out of it just be truthful
[1:22:44] Jeremiah was a man the gift was the
[1:22:50] prophet right right so what did God
[1:22:54] order name before the
[1:22:55] world the gift to stand there and
[1:22:59] condemn Israel but before the world has
[1:23:02] for let him know that Jeremiah would be
[1:23:05] the man
[1:23:09] right amen I want to preach one of these
[1:23:11] days I tried it about 30 years ago and
[1:23:13] it didn't go over I want to preach on
[1:23:15] the real you amen if I ever get to
[1:23:19] enough time I will yes and I tried it
[1:23:21] years ago and everybody went haywire
[1:23:23] with me about it
[1:23:25] you just back off and try to move
[1:23:27] on believe
[1:23:30] it but listen to what brother R goes on
[1:23:32] to say in this quote that we're talking
[1:23:34] about that was number one is going down
[1:23:37] to number two it's a little point on the
[1:23:40] side there 15 2 down through the
[1:23:43] centuries we could go we find a
[1:23:47] Moses a
[1:23:49] Jeremiah that's two in the Old Testament
[1:23:51] one one in new now to bring him to to TI
[1:23:54] the 2 two together in the middle excuse
[1:23:55] me with John and John the
[1:23:58] Baptist and each one of these were God's
[1:24:02] Eternal thought expressed in its
[1:24:08] season each one of them was the word now
[1:24:11] I just got to explaining it so if you
[1:24:13] have trouble with it go back and listen
[1:24:14] to what I
[1:24:16] said
[1:24:19] Jeremiah was a
[1:24:21] man but the gift to speak out against
[1:24:24] Israel was God's
[1:24:26] word it dwelt in a man and made a man
[1:24:29] and the word one but it's after he got
[1:24:32] here yes see the gifts and callings are
[1:24:35] without
[1:24:36] repentance there was no way that there
[1:24:38] was not going to be a Malachi 4 take
[1:24:40] place in the last
[1:24:42] days but there had to be a man on Earth
[1:24:45] could accept that choice and make his
[1:24:49] own and for God to use it but look what
[1:24:51] he
[1:24:52] says then we come to Jesus the Loos he
[1:24:55] was the perfect and complete
[1:24:58] thought expressed and he became known as
[1:25:01] the word that is what he is and forever
[1:25:04] will
[1:25:05] be now it says that he has chosen Us in
[1:25:09] him Jesus before the foundation of the
[1:25:13] world that means that we were right
[1:25:16] there with him in the mind and thoughts
[1:25:20] of God before the foundation of the
[1:25:22] world that gives an eternal quality to
[1:25:26] the elect you can't get away from it
[1:25:33] right but now in case somebody clicks
[1:25:35] onto this one had heard the other one we
[1:25:37] don't believe in Eternal Sinners we
[1:25:39] don't believe you come into the world
[1:25:40] with eternal life that's right as
[1:25:43] they're teaching in the message around
[1:25:45] the
[1:25:47] country you must receive eternal life
[1:25:50] that's right am if not Jesus Christ died
[1:25:53] in vain and they wouldn't no day of
[1:25:54] Pentecost when the Holy Ghost
[1:25:56] fell there wouldn't be anything so we
[1:25:59] don't believe that we believe you must
[1:26:01] receive eternal life but the eternal
[1:26:03] life that you receive never had a
[1:26:05] beginning and never had an ending that's
[1:26:08] right amen and if you receive it here
[1:26:10] then there's one thing about it you're
[1:26:12] part of it back there amen amen if you
[1:26:15] don't get it here you wouldn't have part
[1:26:16] of it back there you could be
[1:26:17] impartations you can do all kind of
[1:26:19] things you see that gives an ET Eternal
[1:26:23] quality
[1:26:25] to you and
[1:26:27] I makes us to realize that God did
[1:26:30] really love
[1:26:32] us desire us to walk with us
[1:26:36] amen because we were a part of him
[1:26:39] remember we kept stressing that point we
[1:26:41] were part of
[1:26:47] him now what does it mean to be an
[1:26:49] offspring you remember we covered that
[1:26:51] what does it mean to be an offspring
[1:26:52] that say want to go
[1:26:55] an offspring is God in another
[1:26:58] form we're not talking about Mom and
[1:27:00] Daddy having
[1:27:04] children an offspring of God is God in
[1:27:06] another
[1:27:07] form because how else you going to keep
[1:27:09] your truth about the the true Oneness of
[1:27:11] the Bible that's right well you're just
[1:27:13] a Oneness well okay let's see you bring
[1:27:15] it
[1:27:16] together I'll be glad to discuss it with
[1:27:18] you than that's open to
[1:27:22] anyone if there just one God if there is
[1:27:25] just one eternal life and that eternal
[1:27:28] life now dwells in you that eternal life
[1:27:30] was in God before the world so that's
[1:27:32] what he
[1:27:35] chose an offspring is God in another
[1:27:38] form Jesus we get the scripture Jesus
[1:27:40] was an I mean the quot the pro Jesus was
[1:27:42] an offspring of God what he was God in
[1:27:45] another form called a son who are we the
[1:27:49] life form of God to the Gentile
[1:27:51] dispensation is the Bride of Jesus
[1:27:53] Christ
[1:27:54] right we are his offspring we're his
[1:27:58] children
[1:27:59] yes and a child of God see we look at a
[1:28:02] child of God like we look at our own
[1:28:07] children it took me and my wife to get
[1:28:09] the kids
[1:28:10] here God didn't have no help to get to
[1:28:13] bring himself here that's why it's
[1:28:15] different
[1:28:17] right on the day of Pentecost he divided
[1:28:20] himself
[1:28:24] but see God is the only one that can
[1:28:26] divide himself and still still be
[1:28:28] completely God Amen there's no way a
[1:28:30] human mortal can comprehend that right
[1:28:34] brother Mo said you take and try to
[1:28:36] describe you know that the parts of and
[1:28:38] you take an apple and you cut it up you
[1:28:39] give it out you run out of
[1:28:42] apple but God on the day of Pentecost
[1:28:45] gave
[1:28:47] 120 eternal life that didn't make him no
[1:28:49] less God that's right he gave 3,000 at
[1:28:52] the next time that didn't make him no
[1:28:53] less God how many millions of him has
[1:28:56] been down through the time from the day
[1:28:58] Pentecost of 2,000 years that don't make
[1:29:00] him no less you know what that makes him
[1:29:03] greater the more he gives away the
[1:29:05] greater he gets like I've always told
[1:29:08] you eternal life is the only thing I
[1:29:09] want to give away you said give away
[1:29:12] your eternal life I wish I
[1:29:17] could I want to give somebody that
[1:29:19] eternal life that I have within me
[1:29:20] that's why I preach the
[1:29:22] gospel cuz the only way I can impart is
[1:29:24] not go out and lay hands
[1:29:28] on the only way I can impart is to
[1:29:30] preach the truth and let you see that
[1:29:33] truth as I was trying to say a while too
[1:29:35] and then you get
[1:29:37] converted you get pricked in your
[1:29:40] heart you get condemned in your heart
[1:29:43] and you go to God because you heard the
[1:29:45] word amen then the seed is really coming
[1:29:47] through the body but it gives an eternal
[1:29:50] quality to the elect look on down at the
[1:29:53] next one
[1:29:55] 284 which is still Church age book but
[1:29:58] this is already in church
[1:30:04] age he's talking about the record the
[1:30:07] book of eternal life for that is another
[1:30:09] book though contain in The Book of Life
[1:30:11] all right do you understand what he
[1:30:12] saying I put a word right
[1:30:16] here there's not two
[1:30:19] books there's not the book of life and
[1:30:21] the Book of eternal life it's one book
[1:30:25] but it's sections of that book now he
[1:30:28] explains this in the church age book and
[1:30:29] he explains it on the um inter Veil oh
[1:30:34] no excuse me do I'll get it in a minute
[1:30:37] it'll click but he explains it it's not
[1:30:40] two books it's two sections of one book
[1:30:43] invisible Union about of
[1:30:46] Christ see it's two
[1:30:49] sections you have a
[1:30:52] section of life there's actually four I
[1:30:55] ain't got time to cover there's four
[1:30:56] qualifications goes in there but there's
[1:30:58] a section in there that's just the book
[1:31:00] of life which is life right and all
[1:31:04] names will be placed in that book of
[1:31:06] life amen because when you come into the
[1:31:08] world your name was put in the book
[1:31:11] right but there's a difference between
[1:31:12] that and the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:31:16] section but the reason this one book is
[1:31:18] because when you started in the world
[1:31:20] you know where you started you started
[1:31:22] with your name in the book now go to the
[1:31:23] invisible Union see if I'm not right you
[1:31:25] started with your name in The Book of
[1:31:28] Life as a human mortal yes when you
[1:31:31] received the new birth your name is
[1:31:33] transferred the prophet said to the
[1:31:35] Lamb's Book of Life you say that's
[1:31:37] adding new words no that's just a record
[1:31:39] down
[1:31:41] here just a record down
[1:31:44] here are you following me yes see now
[1:31:47] you understand the book see it's the
[1:31:49] Bible this this is The Book of Life yes
[1:31:52] yes now in this Book of Life there a lot
[1:31:54] of Records about people that that lived
[1:31:56] in this world and they're going to be
[1:31:58] the records here of a lot of people
[1:31:59] going to die and go to hell because that
[1:32:01] their names were here and they were part
[1:32:02] of this and different things that's
[1:32:04] right but then in here is the bride of
[1:32:07] Christ amen which is eternal life that's
[1:32:10] right right here in this book which is
[1:32:12] the Bible that's what this was what was
[1:32:14] in the hand of the one sitting on the
[1:32:15] throne that's right the prophet are
[1:32:17] called in a book of names this is a book
[1:32:19] of
[1:32:20] names Peter James John Paul
[1:32:24] but it's also a record of their
[1:32:27] life all right you you you following
[1:32:29] with me now it's simple when you
[1:32:31] understand so look what he saying now
[1:32:33] this is the record God hath given us
[1:32:34] eternal life and this life is in his son
[1:32:38] he that hath the son hath life he puts
[1:32:40] Eternal par and he that hath not the son
[1:32:43] hath not life eternal in par and those
[1:32:46] who have that life were in him before
[1:32:50] the foundation of the world they were
[1:32:53] chosen in him him before the foundation
[1:32:55] of the
[1:32:57] world the great Royal seed Jesus Christ
[1:33:01] was planted Now where's he coming down
[1:33:04] to where he was at on Earth cuz we were
[1:33:06] in him he was planted he died and that
[1:33:09] life that was in him came up through the
[1:33:12] wheat plant which is the church ages all
[1:33:15] and is reproducing itself in multitudes
[1:33:17] of wheat seed having the same life in
[1:33:21] them and being like the original because
[1:33:24] by Spirit they are
[1:33:27] original by Spirit we're original by the
[1:33:30] new birth we're
[1:33:32] original that's the real you is the new
[1:33:35] birth
[1:33:36] amen but now follow
[1:33:39] me we were chosen in
[1:33:44] him not just chosen of him because of
[1:33:47] something you
[1:33:49] done not chosen by him because of him
[1:33:52] seeing that you would want it and he
[1:33:54] would choose you that
[1:33:56] way we're back before the world that's
[1:33:58] right we're back there when there's a
[1:34:00] lot of things going on that you and I
[1:34:02] before we heard this prophet's message
[1:34:03] we didn't know what was going on in
[1:34:05] Earth let alone what's going on in
[1:34:06] heaven you
[1:34:08] agree oh we thought we did sure we we
[1:34:11] believe you know we do the best we could
[1:34:13] do oh yeah but he come to expound the
[1:34:17] scriptures to open the scriptures to
[1:34:19] open our
[1:34:21] understanding of God's word right that
[1:34:24] God could reveal it so look that on the
[1:34:26] next
[1:34:26] one this is the message of Israel and
[1:34:30] the church which is part one or number
[1:34:32] one 19th 53 325 which is paragraph

[1:35:16] prophet is speaking the mind of God
[1:35:20] right he is not speaking a human mortal
[1:35:23] mind that's right he is telling us
[1:35:25] what's in God's
[1:35:29] mind cuz he's the only one can go back
[1:35:31] there and get it that's who did it I
[1:35:34] heard it and I come no no you
[1:35:36] never he hath chosen hath past tense has
[1:35:42] chosen us the church in him how long ago

[1:35:50] Revival no before the foundation of the
[1:35:52] world now can now you can ride on the
[1:35:55] cloud see he's done what he chose us in
[1:35:59] him Christ before the
[1:36:01] foundation of the world Amen all
[1:36:06] right questions and
[1:36:08] answers on Genesis 1953 7:29 paragraph

[1:36:30] would have to be back there we're going
[1:36:31] to get into redeeming this when we we
[1:36:33] finally get to the
[1:36:36] point when God created me William Brown
[1:36:41] I was before the foundation of the
[1:36:43] world he made my being my spirit I
[1:36:47] wasn't conscious of anything as far as I
[1:36:50] know
[1:36:51] of but the I was dark oh I I don't
[1:36:55] believe you're getting it but now just a
[1:36:59] minute Jesus told the disciples that he
[1:37:02] knew them before the foundation of the
[1:37:04] world and Paul said here that he chose
[1:37:07] us in him before the foundation of the
[1:37:09] world now there were some part of me
[1:37:13] Arman Neville and the rest of you all
[1:37:16] that's in Christ Jesus
[1:37:19] before the world ever begun and here is
[1:37:22] to my analysis is of
[1:37:24] that it's all right where were we at we
[1:37:27] was in
[1:37:29] Christ now as I tried to explain it in
[1:37:31] many times and and expressing it and
[1:37:34] trying to get better words to do I I
[1:37:37] said I was trying these on my wife she
[1:37:39] gave me some better words to say so I
[1:37:41] try to use them but we know the first
[1:37:43] thing that come out of
[1:37:46] God was God in another form called a
[1:37:50] son what else you going to call it a son
[1:37:53] is Offspring a son is a product of his
[1:37:56] father Yes but in spiritual terms you
[1:37:59] would have a trinity if you wouldn't
[1:38:01] careful but in spiritual terms a Son of
[1:38:03] God is God in another form amen whether
[1:38:06] it be back there in Jesus or be in you
[1:38:09] right it's God in another form that's
[1:38:12] right all right but you see then we look
[1:38:15] back there and we see
[1:38:18] him and run around said a little Halo of
[1:38:21] light goes out
[1:38:23] comes over and said he begins to say Let
[1:38:26] There Be and he said who is that he said
[1:38:29] it's the Son of
[1:38:31] God even your Scholars called it that go
[1:38:33] back in your Bible and read it in
[1:38:35] Genesis cuz they knew my Lord if he seen
[1:38:37] anything what else would it be so would
[1:38:39] it be the man looking down in the fiery
[1:38:40] furnace and and Nebuchadnezzar wouldn't
[1:38:42] it whatever it was throw him in and said
[1:38:44] we we see we throw three in and said we
[1:38:46] look down in there fourth and said he's
[1:38:47] like the Son of
[1:38:49] God why because if he was protecting
[1:38:52] them every who was in there was
[1:38:53] protecting them from being burnt right
[1:38:55] so it had to be
[1:38:57] God and if it's God it had to be in
[1:39:00] another
[1:39:01] form if you could see it so then what
[1:39:04] are we talking
[1:39:06] about we're talking about the Simplicity
[1:39:09] of
[1:39:11] understanding that when he stepped over
[1:39:13] into that form the prophet will call it
[1:39:15] the word he'll call it the theophany he
[1:39:18] called it a part of
[1:39:21] God God in another form
[1:39:24] which is a part of God now there Earth
[1:39:25] where a human mind goes into gears and
[1:39:28] we need to click it off and listen see
[1:39:31] we say a part of God right well I no no
[1:39:34] no no that was all of God that's all God
[1:39:37] going to reveal
[1:39:40] right that's where people don't
[1:39:42] understand me and the way I
[1:39:44] preach that's why brother R could say on
[1:39:47] the River
[1:39:49] Jordan he became the fullness of the
[1:39:52] godhead bodily he didn't say he wasn't
[1:39:54] born God it was just part of God hadn't
[1:39:57] been made
[1:39:59] manifest right see when he stepped over
[1:40:02] into that
[1:40:03] form and begin to say Let There be all
[1:40:07] right now brother brand says if we
[1:40:10] wouldn't there then in him right then
[1:40:14] we'll never be there with eternal life
[1:40:16] cuz that's what stepped over there was
[1:40:17] eternal
[1:40:18] life it's just a story it's a way of
[1:40:21] expressing things right
[1:40:25] but brother randam then would say and I
[1:40:26] don't mind covering it with you he said
[1:40:28] who this meled he said see we byass the
[1:40:31] the
[1:40:32] offy and come over to human to to die
[1:40:36] and be a sinner how do we bypass it 285
[1:40:39] goes around Atlanta you know that's good
[1:40:42] terms Ain it no we just never come that
[1:40:46] way cuz he stood there as part of God
[1:40:50] right called a son we wasn't standing
[1:40:53] all around there looking like him we
[1:40:56] wasin
[1:40:57] him we are part of God that was in him
[1:41:00] that was all of God for what he going to
[1:41:02] reveal that's right that's why people
[1:41:03] don't follow me I can look back and see
[1:41:06] God coming down condescending and still
[1:41:08] see my heavenly father setting up there
[1:41:11] in glory
[1:41:12] amen calling me that has eternal life
[1:41:16] down
[1:41:19] here that's where you don't understand
[1:41:21] the God here let me say something to
[1:41:25] you what are the attributes of
[1:41:29] God father son Holy Ghost right three
[1:41:32] attributes but we talk about attributes
[1:41:34] being savior healer
[1:41:35] Etc do you
[1:41:38] know that when he stepped over in that
[1:41:41] form that would be called a
[1:41:44] son that made him a
[1:41:50] father now listen to what I'm saying
[1:41:56] I didn't think I'd bring it but I got to
[1:41:58] get it
[1:42:01] now what is the attribute of a father
[1:42:03] what is the attribute called
[1:42:07] father you're automatically when you're
[1:42:09] you're you're dealing with attributes
[1:42:10] what is it healer savior Redeemer EXC
[1:42:13] Etc but where did Brother ROM ever cover
[1:42:16] the attribute of a
[1:42:22] father I want you to bring
[1:42:27] it CU you see he was already a
[1:42:31] father that's
[1:42:33] right father is one of his attributes
[1:42:36] right that's right when he created that
[1:42:39] logos theop what all those words are
[1:42:41] that part of God that form and stepped
[1:42:44] over he was a
[1:42:49] father could communicate back with him
[1:42:54] say let
[1:42:56] us brother around said father and son
[1:42:59] and you can do what you want to with it
[1:43:01] that's what he said he said word and
[1:43:03] spirit said let us make man in our
[1:43:08] image you know that when he created Adam
[1:43:10] in the Garden that made him father
[1:43:17] right and you see we're going a long
[1:43:21] ways but Adam and the
[1:43:25] garden never made him the father he
[1:43:28] wanted to be
[1:43:32] right I want you to Coast there a little
[1:43:35] bit made him father you remember the
[1:43:38] prophet saying that he was God but said
[1:43:41] he wasn't God he said cuz he was nothing
[1:43:43] to worship him he said he made angels
[1:43:45] and they worshiped him that made him God
[1:43:47] see we We Roll on that but now roll with
[1:43:49] me on father
[1:43:56] where is the attribute of
[1:44:03] father he created Adam and that made him
[1:44:06] a father that's right but that was not
[1:44:08] the father he wanted to be
[1:44:14] right he created a logos the form and
[1:44:17] stood there but that was that was the
[1:44:20] greatest of all and would ever be
[1:44:23] but that was not what he wanted to
[1:44:29] be got a long way to go I'm going to
[1:44:32] leave
[1:44:35] that cuz that way if you want to run off
[1:44:37] and just do all you want to with it then
[1:44:38] you can do it I'll come back to it but
[1:44:42] just
[1:44:43] remember Adam never made him the father
[1:44:46] he wanted to
[1:44:49] be
[1:44:50] right and brother brandom if he had made
[1:44:53] one statement you and I would be in
[1:44:55] terrible
[1:44:57] shape
[1:44:59] yes he said he's the son of
[1:45:02] man that's the only way he can be the
[1:45:05] father that's
[1:45:09] right okay we're going
[1:45:13] somewhere makes you more Curious maybe
[1:45:15] and thinking make you listen look go the
[1:45:19] next

[1:50:18] according as he has chosen Us in him how
[1:50:21] chosen us the elect now the ones that's
[1:50:23] in Christ Jesus he chose us in him when
[1:50:28] yesterday the day before listen the
[1:50:30] scripture before the foundation of the
[1:50:32] world I'm surely not reading that wrong
[1:50:35] that's the way it reads here in the King
[1:50:37] James version God CH you in Christ
[1:50:39] before the foundation of the world was
[1:50:41] ever laid then if God knew that what you
[1:50:45] scared about if God knew way back before
[1:50:48] the foundation of the world to choose
[1:50:49] you in Christ Jesus and you come in and
[1:50:52] accepted the call what you scared about
[1:50:55] what's the matter sisters he can heal he
[1:50:58] can
[1:50:59] say you come and accepted the
[1:51:02] call I this over here right so the
[1:51:06] prophet never left us
[1:51:10] dangling chosen in him just listen to
[1:51:14] that little tug in your heart right yeah
[1:51:16] but brother I have so many troubles I
[1:51:18] have so many problems I need to quit
[1:51:20] this I need to quit that I ain't never
[1:51:22] preached nothing like that and I never
[1:51:24] will I'll never preach you quit doing
[1:51:27] things
[1:51:28] wrong and God will save you cuz there is
[1:51:32] no
[1:51:33] scripture that is our Holy Ghost
[1:51:36] righteousness of our own we think I
[1:51:39] didn't drink I didn't do now like oh oh
[1:51:41] really so and so or sister so and so I
[1:51:43] I've been good all my life and God chose
[1:51:46] me now you are in a garbage can of
[1:51:48] Satan's
[1:51:51] delusion that's why it doesn't bother me
[1:51:53] to preach to people that'll come to me
[1:51:55] and tell me brother Dale I've been
[1:51:57] married before I've had all these
[1:51:59] problems I've been this I've been in
[1:52:01] adultery I've been in all kind of things
[1:52:04] I believe in
[1:52:05] Deliverance amen I don't believe in
[1:52:08] going on and doing it after you see the
[1:52:09] truth no but I believe in Deliverance I
[1:52:12] believe in Salvation
[1:52:17] amen but see we think we was just maybe
[1:52:20] and that's what a lot of people say they
[1:52:22] I'm just not good enough to be saved no
[1:52:24] sir I agree with you
[1:52:26] 100% that's there's never been a mortal
[1:52:28] in the world good enough to be saved
[1:52:31] there was Jesus Christ died in
[1:52:34] vain but why can't we accept what he
[1:52:36] done for us right and believe it why
[1:52:40] can't we look at it then and see that he
[1:52:42] chose me back there you said but Brother
[1:52:46] D I don't have that eternal life
[1:52:47] dwelling in me all right that's the
[1:52:50] thing you need that's right well how do
[1:52:52] I get it by believing God's
[1:52:55] word and you may do it in 5 minutes or
[1:52:58] you may do it in 5
[1:53:02] years that's between you and God right
[1:53:06] but you see we got all of the things
[1:53:08] that we think that we were this and we
[1:53:10] were that I'm trying to tell you that
[1:53:12] eternal life the prophet was speaking of
[1:53:15] was a part of
[1:53:17] God and he imparts that to you and I and
[1:53:20] gives us eternal life
[1:53:23] then we're part of God we're an
[1:53:25] offspring of God we're a child of God
[1:53:27] which means we're God in another form
[1:53:29] right what El are you well don't Brother
[1:53:32] D I'm just a child of God you're making
[1:53:34] it too big I'm not making it big enough
[1:53:40] right he chose it this
[1:53:44] way he knew there was going to be a fall
[1:53:47] but he knew he was going to have
[1:53:49] children amen why because they were a
[1:53:53] part of it that's
[1:53:56] right you better think about what I said
[1:53:58] about
[1:54:03] father because healer savior Redeemer
[1:54:06] and all is just bringing you back that's
[1:54:09] right paying a
[1:54:12] price but if he wasn't my
[1:54:18] father why do you think brother random
[1:54:20] would make this statement I didn't give
[1:54:21] it to you now
[1:54:24] but he said Jesus never came to give me
[1:54:27] an
[1:54:30] inheritance you remember
[1:54:34] that he said he came to redeem me to my
[1:54:38] inheritance he said my inheritance was
[1:54:41] eternal life with the
[1:54:43] father before the
[1:54:46] world that's my
[1:54:49] inheritance eternal life
[1:54:54] well then you know maybe I was born with
[1:54:56] eternal life I don't believe that I
[1:54:59] don't even believe Adam was born with
[1:55:00] eternal life I've preached it to
[1:55:05] you Adam was standing in the garden
[1:55:08] living moving human being wrote around
[1:55:10] and said BL see his name and God
[1:55:12] breathed into his nostrils your breath
[1:55:14] of eternal life go read the book that's
[1:55:16] right amen why cuz if it had it would
[1:55:19] have been God standing there it wouldn't
[1:55:20] have been Adam that's right see Adam was
[1:55:22] created Body Spirit and soul of man
[1:55:25] right and then God
[1:55:27] breathe into him eternal
[1:55:33] life or else he would have been God
[1:55:35] standing there wouldn't have been
[1:55:37] Adam
[1:55:38] sech We Are The Offspring of God the
[1:55:42] prophet said that the full the the that
[1:55:45] godhead was not complete without
[1:55:49] you if you're a part of God how can God
[1:55:52] be complete without
[1:55:54] you come on Brothers think on these
[1:55:58] things eternal
[1:56:03] life a
[1:56:06] possession that we can
[1:56:09] have you said but if you could just make
[1:56:11] it simple enough I could get
[1:56:13] saved what else can I say then what the
[1:56:16] Bible says repent everyone and be
[1:56:17] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:56:19] remission of sins and you shall receive
[1:56:20] the gift of the Holy Ghost it didn't say
[1:56:22] you get it to minute is baptized it
[1:56:24] didn't make that statement it said ye
[1:56:25] shall that's
[1:56:28] right which could be years
[1:56:30] later but it don't have to be it can be
[1:56:32] that very minute if you believe
[1:56:34] it
[1:56:36] right if God is tugging at your heart
[1:56:39] don't turn down
[1:56:42] that Brother D I just feel condemned
[1:56:45] that's God tugging at your
[1:56:46] heart right then they say God forgive me
[1:56:51] come and save me yes and you know what
[1:56:55] this is what a lot of people don't like
[1:56:56] see then after you to be a Christian
[1:56:58] after you're filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:56:59] you're still have that longing in your
