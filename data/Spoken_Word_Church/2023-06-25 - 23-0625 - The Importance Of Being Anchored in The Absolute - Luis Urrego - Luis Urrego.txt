========================================
amen good morning Saints God bless you trust that you all are doing well we're going to see if this if they can get this up in the back I don't know if they can and if they can't that's okay we'll just uh do what we can amen this is another day that the Lord has made let us rejoice and be glad in it praise the Lord Jesus hey man let's just buy our heads before we start our heavenly father we just thank you once again for another opportunity to serve you and Lord to come father to worship you in spirit and in truth and to Feast upon your word we ask Lord that you would have your way here this seat this morning and Lord you just be the spokesperson here in this little lesson help us father God to see you Lord and father God just let us receive something Lord that we can take father immediately Lord God and just put it to practice Lord have faith in your word we ask these things now in Jesus Christ's name amen I said we can turn this screen here all right we'll zoom in a little bit hope you all can see that there all right so we're going to talk this morning about the importance uh you know I never can get away from this but The Importance of Being anchored in an absolute amen and uh I believe that that we all should have absolutes and there's absolutes in life amen they're undeniable there are unquestionable there that that you know um that that you can't get away from amen and so I think that if you have absolutes in your life physically in your in your physical life in your everyday life how much more in your spiritual life you should be anchored into something amen that you're not you're the devil tries and and throws everything at you every day to keep you uneven and then to keep you Rocky but you are anchored and you are solid in an absolute and we know that brother Brandon preached that message called the absolute praise the Lord Jesus it's a good one if you don't if you haven't heard it so I'm gonna read a few of those quotes from that message but let's start here with the scripture here in second Peter chapter one and uh we'll just kind of go through here quickly so Simon Peter is servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given us have given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness thank God for that through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature haven't escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this given all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience into patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness into brotherly kindness charity for these things be in you and the bound not just to be in you but they abound in other words they are expanding they are growing in your life they make you that ye shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ it's an absolute that when a tree an apple tree is growing uh eventually he's got to abound and given fruit right and the more you nurture that amen the more it's going to give it's going to give so it's the same thing here what Peter is talking about but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence give diligence to make your calling an election sure and that's why I wanted to make make your calling an election sure know where you are standing in this walk with Christ amen uh for if ye do these things ye shall never fall that's an absolute that Peter is giving you amen for if you do these things you shall never fall amen now you're going to make mistakes in your in your in your life in your walk with God you're gonna but you're never gonna fall once you've receive the new birth you can't fall your soul can't fall hey man you've you're anchored Amen in the absolute and the absolute anchored in you praise God amen for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly in the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them Peter is saying you know even if you know these things I'm still going to remind you and be established be established in the present truth amen you can look at the foundations of this building amen they have to they have to be established in order to keep building upon it and if there's no established foundations this the building eventually is going to crawl same thing in your spiritual life if you have nothing established in your life spiritually if you're not established in the word of God spiritually amen eventually at some point down the road something will come your way that's going to make you fall and make you crumble now I'm afraid that sometimes some of us amen we might think we are strong and we might think that we are okay but in reality there's Rocky areas in our life they have some the right thing comes along amen it'll it'll cause us to come completely crumble and I hope that that's not the case no matter how close the person is to you or no matter what what's going on the situation is and you make sure that if they're not going or if something happens I'm still God I still have to go I still got to move on with God because my my walk doesn't depend on on on who's still here or what's going on Amen I still got to move on with God Amen it can't it can't depend on family members and it can't depend amen I gotta move on you see so so that that that's having an absolute that's being established in truth amen and you having a rebel as I spoke Wednesday night you having a revelation of yourself of your own amen of what God Said in his word amen Walking with God that way a man allows for things to come at you and all kinds of Winds of doctrine that will come to you all kinds of man's opinions and all kinds of different thoughts that man might bring to you but you are established you are I'm anchored in an absolute that can't it's unmovable and I'm not moving with it because again it's unmovable amen so what is the what does the word absolute mean it means from free from imperfection in other words perfect I wish I could get that a little bigger but that's about as good as I can do here positive unquestionable and man there's it's it's unquestionable it's fundamental and brother Brandon would use his word I believe he would use this word in that message uh the absolute is the ultimate and then it's the Supreme amen there we have a what a supreme court in this in this in this country I mean that when decisions the uh you know of cases that have not been made and they can't come to a decision well then there's that Supreme Court that's supposed to make the decision amen and whatever they say it doesn't matter if the majority of the American people don't agree with it what they say goes right because they are the Supreme Court in other words they are the absolute Court you see and so it doesn't matter what anybody else says amen what the word of God says is the supreme law is the Supreme word it is the absolute amen because if they try to teach uh they try to teach uh you know the the things that we hear nowadays about genders and stuff like that they can do it all along and they can shout and manifest and and Proclaim and out in the streets marching and and doing all their nasty things that they do up in New York and all that but it doesn't change nature it doesn't change what how God made a man and what and how God made a woman and years down the road you they could say as much as they want to I am binary I'm non-binary I'm not a man or a woman you're one of the two because that's what God established at the beginning there's no there's no way there's no way around it that's a that's an absolute you see years down the road 50 60 100 300 years down the road if if if if we are still here and they dig up the non-binary bones they're going to either say that was a man or a woman they know even by the bones that you were male or female so right now they're just you know I'm all this but in reality God is like you're you're a man you're a woman it's what I created you and he ain't worried about it I ain't worried about it because that's my absolute you see but all it is is just nothing but a questionable things and trying to get people riled up in in in in their minds and perfectly embodying the nature of a thing amen so it's it's the ultimate now we were talking I'm just talking about that in recent years tolerance has become a virtue it's become a virtue now nowadays that that you just tolerate whatever anybody believes and if they come to you if they come to you and I notice this more with with with our young people that that that they'll they'll try to tell you something and you just have to just just not say anything you just have to just kind of accept it but but then when you try to tell them the truth they get mad and I'm trying to tell you the truth from the Bible what but but yet you have to accept everything they tell you or anybody else here you know but when you try to tell them truth oh no no no no no no you gotta accept what I say but but I don't have to accept what you say that doesn't work that way you're coming to me to try to you know to tell me what you what you what you believe now you're asking me what I believe then let me tell you what I believe you see you see I don't try to impose what I believe on people but I think it's your duty your duty bound and when somebody asks what you believe and what you think about this you should tell them you should tell them and you should not be ashamed of it whatsoever you're Duty bound because God tells us to do that in his word because why that person may be genuinely asking you because he or she really wants to know amen sometimes we think that somebody just wants to challenge Us in reality they may not be one of the challenges they really want to know amen so be ready that's what we always study that's what we always pray and and and seeking the word amen you believe what you want and I'll believe what I want and everyone will be happy and get along that's the society that will be that we live in nowadays and but it it doesn't work that way yeah sure they believe whatever they want but now if they they're forcing me to believe how they want they want me to believe I don't go that way I because I don't force them to believe the way I believe it's a two-way streak you see it's a two-way you know and we'll be we'll be fine that way you see but ironically tolerance which Embraces every kind of idea or belief denies the existence of absolutes that's very that's a very interesting amen but we know that the Bible is clear that absolutes do exist amen and and there's absolute truth because it begins with God Amen he is the source of life he is the the originator of of all things amen the Bible says in the beginning God created amen there was a creation and we are part of that creation and there's an order an absolute order that God created things and the way he he put things in order that's that's that's established and it can't be moved that's right and when you go against the established ways of God let's say for example you go against nature amen that's why nature Rebels and they push back and and hence you have all the different catastrophes and the different things why because you're coming against nature amen certain laws certain things amen so brother Branham says here sir brogram says here in the absolute he says that's the way a man when he's born again of the Holy Spirit he's got a hold of something that's got an anchor out yonder and the storms doesn't shake him he knows he's all right he's anchored all right amen you imagine a man on a boat and he's he's uh you know the waves are tossing and and to and fro amen but he knows that he can depend on that anchor amen and that anchor amen is going to hold him and it's gonna fall in the established ground you see down in the bottom of the sea and it'll keep him it'll keep him steady I don't know all the details of how it all works but I just know he's our anchor I don't know where else to turn to but him Peter said Lord where could we go there's no other anchor to turn to but you amen so thank God for that anchor amen so we have to make his word our absolute and brother Brown continues saying oh you might say I wish that's all he required today he was speaking of job's requirement offer burnt offerings for him and his family but it's less than that amen it's less than that just faith in his word and you if you make his word you're absolute you can hey man you can Amen brother Wade's been reading that quote where brother Ryan says yes you can you can any Divine promise in the Bible you can tie your soul to it amen because it's it's an absolute now if you really believe that what God Said in his word is the Eternal Word of God then you can take every promise that God said about you and say Lord I believe it that settles it I'm moving on with that amen that's an absolute praise God no matter how much the waves whip you around you're still tied to your absolute no matter what comes and goes and no matter what sickness has come no matter what happens you are still tied to your absolute amen praise the Lord Jesus so what is absolute truth man I'm trying to move a little quickly now absolute truth has been defined as that which is true for all people amen for all times and for all places amen and I don't know if one thing better than than the word of God the word of God is is is uh it is an absolute for all times for all places and for all people amen and what is the word of God who is the word of God as our Lord Jesus Christ absolute truth is objective it's Universal and constant amen it never changes absolute truth originates from God who didn't just create truth but who is truth that's the reason why he said I am the way their truth and the life he did not say I am away and I am a truth and I am a life no I am the the the this is the pulpit right this is the pulpits this is the church's Pulpit amen and this is the mic that belongs to the pulpit you see this is not a mic amen this is the mic because I see no others there's no other mics but this mic that's what God is trying to say Amen that I am the way I am the truth and I am the life so when there's gray areas in our life amen about about certain things that you're questioning or you're not sure about something go back to the way go back to the truth it's in here I mean it's in so much that it that that that it speaks about the way you should even handle money that's how that's how that's how that's how deep God gets amen into your life because well sometimes we think that the Bible is just a bunch of stories and history and and and a bunch of uh uh just names and and numbers but it's a life that wants to touch your life in a personal way yes yes not only just not only not only it reveals because the Bible says that it will lead you and guide you the holy spirit will lead you and guide you into all truth not just doctrinal truth not just not just the the the the the the truths that we we know about but the truth about you the truth about your life amen and where you should go and what you should do amen praise God I believe that with all my heart amen that's why the Bible says seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and and then all these other things shall be added unto you amen some a couple of verses here where where the Lord talks about absolute truth he says in John 3 33 he that he that hath received his testimony amen hath set to his seal that God is true amen in Psalm 119 89-91 and verse 160 says forever O Lord Thy word is settled settled in heaven amen amen you know there are settlements in in business settlements in court amen when things are settled they're supposed to not even they're settled not even brought up anymore there's no question about it anymore amen it's settled forever forever in God's eyes forever Lord Thy word is settled in heaven thy faithfulness is unto all generations thou Hast established the Earth and it abideth amen praise the Lord Jesus they will never move it it shall stand amen what God created from the beginning it doesn't change amen I like what brother Michael was bringing about the the North Star last last last last Sunday amen the North Star amen it never it never moves it's always there and even the pyramids Amen in in different different pyramids around the world and things like that they Point always and they to the North Star because the North Star is always constant yes it never changes amen it's always firm amen and watch what David continues saying here in verse 91 they continue this day amen according to thy ordinances amen for all for all are thy servants all the things that God created his creation everything they're all his servants and they and what and what the in the original word that God commanded them to be amen Moon over there stars over here son over here amen they they continue to do exactly what God created them to do amen they don't deviate from their from their pattern and from their purpose praise God praise the Lord Jesus and so that's why I was saying that these laws of creation they're undeniable amen you you can't we know that water's wet right we know that that I opened this and I pour it I pour it right here it's gonna get the carpet wet because water is whipped right that's undeniable that's right we know my dad used to joke with me sometimes uh you know he's like hey son go out there and see if the the rain water is wet laughs and it took me a little while as when I was little Amen to figure out what was he what does he mean eventually I got I got it you know water's wet you know there's uh uh you know the moon always is always shiny amen praise God the the you know there's there's laws in nature and then if you go against those laws amen nature will rebel against you because nature wants to obey the original creator not what man thinks about it not what NASA thinks about it amen it's what God said about it amen and what God said about it from the beginning amen I'd rather believe that amen then that's what that's what that that's what nature does Amen it listens to its original Creator yes and doesn't listen to man's opinions or whatever they say about about CR about creation so and so and so it's the same thing with human with with standards amen with men and women there must be standards upon which human life is based standards that if followed create peace and Harmony and order in relationships amen there must be you know two men in a fish in a ship is called Fellowship amen you know uh I listen to you and you listen to me and that's how we have Fellowship but when somebody's taking over a conversation there's no Fellowship there it's just constantly just talking and talking and talking and talking and you and you can't bring your your what you want to say out there's no Fellowship in that there's no relationship there amen don't you just hate that when somebody just keeps talking and talking and they don't stop you know that's just me I don't know about that I want to get something in there too you know I want to say something your your thoughts are make are sparking things in my mind that I want to share with you too that's what Fellowship is but when somebody's all up in your face just talking the whole time like all right let's take a break right but don't no matter how much we argue about these laws and about these things amen it doesn't change anything that's right they're established they can fuss and fight and argue and change their their their bodies foreign and you can't deny that no matter how much a woman I told my my wife the other day and we're almost done here we did at 10 15 or 10 20 by the way I'm sorry what time do we stop 10 15 okay we got one minute no matter how much no matter how much a woman tries to try to become a man or change her look the way there's no denying that you look that woman from far away and you can you can see that that that that that that's a woman same thing with a man amen there's no they're not because the God's footprint is there you go see God's footprint is there praise God so and that and then the the in Psalms chapter 119 verse 160 Thy word is true from the beginning and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth forever amen Proverbs 12 19 says the lip of true shall be established forever but a lying tongue is but of is but for a moment amen so all the the lies that we hear nowadays amen that's only for a moment amen God's word abideth forever the grass Isaiah 48 the grass withereth the flower fadeth but the word of our God shall stand forever amen and in Romans 3 3 4 we'll just we'll just finish with this amen for what if some did not believe shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect God forbid yea let God be true but every man a liar Amen Let God be true I don't know I'm in society tells me that I should believe it this way Amen Let God be true this is the only book that has that has lasted the the test of time is the number one sold book in the world and people have tried to destroy this thing this book in many different countries and yet we still have copies of it somehow it has survived I don't think that's by coincidence I think God did that amen so so that's that's where I'm gonna anchor my soul on and if God sends me to Hell amen because I've anchored his soul my soul on this book then God was righteous in doing that because that's that's this is where I stand amen so let's make sure that we are anchored and absolute let's have the musicians come [Applause] on you know time goes by so fast when you're having fun you think you think when you're up here on I don't have enough content I just you you have more than enough God bless you thank you for your listen hello
