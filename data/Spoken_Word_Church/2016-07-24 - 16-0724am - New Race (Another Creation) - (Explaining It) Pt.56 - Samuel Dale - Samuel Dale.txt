scriptures we'll read from Revelations 3:14 where we've been reading and we'll go to John 14 amen just remember the announcements that have been made and also you know we getting everything set up for the train ride and all so today is the last day to sign up if you want to go and and just uh let us know we'll get everything in order hopefully because you have to know what how many before you can sign up I mean to call them and so we're hoping everything will be okay all right but just remember remember that okay remember that uh the Lord willing next Sunday brother Royo Serano will be with us and ministering for the weekend and then remember on the next Sunday which is the 7th will be brother Quinn and then on the Wednesday following that on the 10th will be brother Keith Reed and then brother Nestor will be with us on the 14th now we're planning on going up on the Friday I think it's the 5th of August that to the Ruth meeting as we always try to go up at least for one meeting so if you desire to go with us let us know we'll try to make arrangements and everything for anybody that wants to go with us you know to uh to the Ruth meeting but we'll only going for that like the one night on the Friday night but we you know pray the Lord would bless those brothers and all you got the announcements who's ministering and all and uh all like that good to see everybody in the house of the Lord I think we have a couple of visitors back there three and four maybe so we're glad to always have visitors and we say when you come one time you're welcome as a visitor two times you're just a part of us so just to have a good time in the Lord and and Worship the Lord amen any other announcements I know we have many sicknesses Among Us and remember if you will my brother John one older than I am that uh he has been told that he has every how you pronounce it Pate every what the word for that is cancer and they want to start doing treatments and but that's my brother that's older than I am so remember him and just keep him in your prayers am right I think that's all the announcements anything else and I'm forgetting okay all right let's go to before we go to the scripture let's pray to the Lord father we thank you for your loving grace unto us we thank you for all things and we know that you give them to us freely all we've got to do is just say thank you for because you're a wonderful father and you you carry care for your people and Lord it's not our desires a lot of times that we want it's what you desire for us because it would always be fulfilled in that we would never uh be without the biggest portion of our of our desires being fulfilled because you're that much concerned with us and we ask you to just bless each one remember the sick among us remember these ones Lord that we've requested it has been today and just bless each one have your way with each and every one of us and guide us in Jesus name amen amen Revelations 34 and unto the Ang Angel of the Church of the lady ofand right these things sayth the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God and let's go to John we won't get part of this this morning but we lay a ground work for this afternoon but we want to go to John 14 we'll begin about the 11th verse you know this is Jesus declaring himself and who he is and his works and if you don't believe me believe the works you know verse 11 believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work sake verily verely isolate in other words there's no excuse when you tell somebody something the way he would do and then God comes behind and vindicates that there's no excuse there's no point so then you're just that settles it other words he said if you can't believe me believe the works all right so then that's way we ought to be in the message the hour right verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go with my unto my father now he's going to the father and he'll declare that but now this afternoon we're going to have to drop it back cuz remember the disciples had power to cast out Devils heal the sick etc etc way before this situation comes into existence but we're reading this kind of like we're going to have a review and then a preview to a few things and and move it up in that form all right so look verse 13 and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth Now who's the comt whom the L whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you right there and watch now and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye shall see ye see me because I live you shall live also now watch you at that day now that's this day righten okay we'll emphasize that this afternoon more but at that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word that's my favorite scripture on a thought that I've always tried to make to you to where you can understand because Jesus said at that day what you'll know right I am in the father and ye in me and I and you am like I say it's easy to understand him and us because of the new birth but remember he's saying you I in you but you in me all right now we're going to try to carry the thought over to where we can cut off this morning and then this afternoon we'll get in into uh what we're doing and that's the reason I chose to make kind of like a preview uh a review of a little and then preview some things that we will be covering and then we will drop back into that thought you know and uh you know I love the word of God it's to me it's it's the uh the greatest of anything you could ever think of and uh I I've never understood Mankind in his ways uh you know have you ever thought of it like this people say you know they say it about me they say well brother Dale you studied so much until you're just so deep we can't understand you well you know what I told my wife yesterday I've come to one conclusion the deeper you get into the word of God the more simpler it becomes amen all right the deeper you get into the word of God the more simpler so how what is the key to for it to be simple to be able to understand it right what's the key to being able to understand the word steady is to get into the word get as deep as you can get into it and then you'll see how much more simpler it is when once you come to point because that's what it is with me people say well I I can't understand you but let me ask you a question I mean a question containing say like people say brother brandham does this the brother brandham you know uh he revealed no no there no man can reveal anything to you now it takes the Lord Jesus Christ to reveal all right now what do you say then is being done I'd like to preach this this really to you what do you think about it what is being done you know I'm talking about what we've heard the message and the things and all of that and and uh what do you think about that do you realize that if it is true that you cannot interpret the word right it is not to be interpreted what is it to be it's to be believed yep well well brother Dale you don't think brother BR no brother brandham didn't interpret nothing to us the Lord Jesus said even my own life right amen that's paraphrasing it with the scripture you know my own life he said didn't reveal that that's right now then what are we doing why are we at church what are we what's the whole purpose of going to church and the things all right we believe it's for salvation right number one point okay all right that's settled now but from then on it's to be uh become the children of God all right then as I said if it's true that that nobody can reveal anything to you why do we need a fivefold Ministry why did we need a prophet why do we need the word written why do we need anything like that come on you know that there's no way I can interpret it to you right but now there's a lot of difference in the word interpret and explain right now did you get that there's a lot of difference between interpreting and explaining right all right now if you're going to be a doctor do you go to school for them to interpret how to do things now listen to the words I'm using come on do you go to learn how to that they can interpret it to you no you go to learn how they explain it to you right see there's a lot of difference in explaining something and interpreting it and brother brandham said it this way that a minister could only do one thing he said that's break the spell that Satan has over your eyes to where God can speak to you now that's all I try to do all right so then as I try to explain it it's not interpreting it well I think it's all the same word well that's okay you're not getting the point that's right you're not listening to my thought what is the thought nobody can interpret it takes the Holy Spirit to do the interpreting right right but we can try to explain it yes mhm and trying to explain it is not trying to interpret it come onen Hallelujah I'm trying to explain it the way that the Holy Spirit can interpret it right now in the medical realm as I said Doctor whatever you're going to school for whatever you're doing you know I mean a mechanic you go down to a mechanic and and you get a mechanic you get I go down and say Donnie I want to learn how to tear a motor apart and put it back together I want you to interpret that to me there's no such thing but I want you to explain to me how this is done and you know yourself that you're constantly growing in all Realms of life amen it doesn't matter if you're planting beans or holding a garden they're always coming up with a new hoe they're always coming up with a new a plant or a new seed or something but it's not trying to interpret so that's what we say to people right how many of you ever talk to somebody how many of you ever talk to somebody about their their hir it's cut and they say that's the way you what inter that's the way you interpret it you're not trying to interpret it right you're trying to expl explain why you have the long high right and that is not an interpretation that is the point you're trying to fulfill the word of God right if not why are you doing it right so then it's not say well that's your opinion no a lot of difference in opinion and trying to help somebody to understand something right that's why the trouble has been so much we've misinterpreted even our own human languages to where we don't understand see the Bible don't need anybody to interpret it brother brandham never come to interpret the Bible we we've never taught nothing like that or believe nothing of that way right you said yeah but what about this thing what about this thing what about that he come to explain it that's right to where God could reveal it right you see other there things in the Bible now watch my point then this Bible that we have right we claim to be the word of God right you know the Bible never taught a Trinity right but we interpret it as doing that right come on be sensible we interpreted it as being a trinity it never taught that hell was eternal we interpreted that right and we tried to explain it but it didn't do much good did it right are you following me yes see the Bible then is not deep how could it be deep if God is the one to reveal it I thought we believe that Jesus said did he hid it from the wise and The Prudent but would reveal it or not in the scripture written out there but reveal it unto babes such as would Lear that's not an interpreting of that that's explaining it a lot of difference in explaining and interpreting right you see we say brother random came to interpret the Bible to us now come on you say well I've got quotes yeah I have two I like to read he said a prophet would interpret now watch I well there's the word interpreting you should interpret but what did he say interpret what was written in his own life come on read the message a prophet would interpret what's written in his own life how can you explain anything you can only explain what's written in your life amen right that's right so you understand what I'm saying we say interpret there's no such thing as to interpret the Bible said what come on am I quoting brother Bram the Bible said a virgin shall conceive now who interpreted that there was no one in the world could interpret that right cuz how can a virgin conceive now don't get into garbage with me about artificial semination and things get out of that see your smart elic brain is what's running into people off get what I'm saying yes when the Bible said a virgin shall conceive there's a lot of difference in conceiving and artificial insemination right right come on but listen it don't need to be interpreted it needed somebody to believe it right and make alive what was in their own life is that what mury done be it unto me according to Thy word amen where was the interpretation the five word that brought forth a body what is it in this message that is deep sure I agree with you 100% in your thinking the way it's done by a lot of people trying to interpret it it don't work too good right but I'm trying to tell you that that's not right right yeah we got two boys there now one little and one big one now if we have any fights I'll take the little one good to see boys listen these little Fells come up from way down there with you know but listen church do you understand what I'm getting at yes brother random never come to interpret the Bible do you and I right he couldn't do it he came to explain what was in his own life I thought we believe the Bible that it said the what the husband me what before the preacher can preach what does the Bible say about him the husbandmen must be what partakers of the fruit that's why there's a lot of things I don't preach on you know why because I don't know it is that sensible yeah right I don't know it I I wouldn't preach on the Statue of a perfect man until about 1982 or 80 something and brother moed preached it in 71 and 72 but see I didn't understand how the virtues could be brought into a human body or a human person until the Lord revealed it he didn't interpret it he told me what it said add to your virtue well only thing I had to figure out was how did you get that to working you know how you figure out how to get that to working you listen to him and what did he say the opening of the word is what will bring these things into being am was that an interpretation no it was a revelation that wasn't something I tried to interpret it was something I could read right see what's wrong with the people of the message and the ministers especially is they're trying to interpret this message that's why you got all kind of garbage Canin doctrines two Soul 7th anniversary polygamy per of this you got scus of it and no wonder the people don't want to hear Brother Brown's message but see all I want you to know is one thing for sure I believe the message but if it don't bring Christ to you what good is the message right Y and brother random was so simple in bringing Christ show me something deep in this Bible there is nothing deep it's what we said that made it unexplainable when Jesus said I and my father are one they killed him right was that true that don't have to be interpreted does it what is it to interpret when you say I and my father's one that's right explaining yes explaining that God came into Christ that's not the interpretation cuz you can't interpret it when he said unless you believe that I am he he said you will die in your sins now where does that need to be interpreted what would be the interpretation but explaining how God brought it to Pi can bring to you and I the ability for God to reveal it to us I thought we needed a revelation more than anything I thought without a revelation and listen quoting it right I thought without a revelation the gates of hell would Prevail but I thought if it was a revelation the gates of hell can't Prevail now where does that need to be interpreted well brother random come into interpret these seals now wait a minute it was already in the Bible right that's right he didn't come to interpret it he come to explain it right it was already in the Bible that's right but people are looking for some mystery of how to explain it I mean how to interpret it oh that brother oh look at his interpretation we need to get away from the word interpretation and get down to explaining and then let God reveal because if we interpret God can't reveal listen if we interpret God does not have to reveal I thought the Revelation was the interpretation come on folks we say oh that's just so deep I can't understand it no it means you've never sat down and tried to understand you've tried to interpret it you've listened to what other people said to you and you took that as interpretations that's right brother R never come to interpret the Bible I gave you the quote there come on I'm with you a prophet cannot interpret the word but he can explain what's in his own life all right as I've said to you many times Martin Luther no telling how many times he preached on the J shall live by faith surely he must have been thinking about it you know there were a lot of people doing that and talking about that before Luther ever brought his message right there were many uh reformations that flew up before Luther came forth with his thesis but see one day it was revealed to him that's right that the just shall live by faith that was in his life right that was a part of him right then all he was ever trying to do was explain what he had inside of him right that should be what we all as ministers would strive to do not to interpret something but try to explain what is in our own lives because it's not in your life come on I quote you the scripture the HUD women must be first partakers of the fruit he's got to have it revealed to him before he can explain what is being said but see we we want to interpret we want something interpreted there there was no such thing it's explaining it when God reveals it that is the interpretation right you remember when you argued about the water baptism you remember when they told you about the somebody did about the water baptism that's just your way of seeing it but then when you lay it down and you express it in good terminologies that Father Son and Holy Ghost has to be Lord Jesus Christ amen is that an interpretation or Revelation first off if you think it's an interpretation you missed it second off if it's it's just head knowledge it'll do you no good cuz somebody else can argue out of the other things right right that's right but if it's a revelation you lot different right come on church we don't want to give it in the right order right you know that John Wesley got his message of the sanctification from the moravians every you pronounce the word word I that when he was coming to America to convert the Indians and he went back home saying L I went to America to convert the Indians and found out I needed to be converted myself that was what struck the world what was in his life that's right not an interpretation that's right that's right right right well how do you interpret that I hope you remember remember that and next time somebody comes along and says how do you interpret that you explain what I just said right you say I can't interpret it you can't interpret it what does it say what does it say you understand what I'm getting at see the Bible didn't change when the prophet came we already had the Bible book forms and things right before the prophet came on the scene which is trying to express what the word says right there's a lot of difference then I hope you understand that a lot of difference between explaining and interpreting so the next time somebody said that's the way you interpreted said I'm not trying interpret it cuz I can't and neither can you we said you explain your Trinity to me now come on right you explain your Trinity to me and then we'll see whether it matches up with the word of God or not see there there never was a trinity taught until the Catholic church and the things coming along about 325 ad is where they begin to and that's first I see in Council and that's where they begin to bring forth the idea and really it didn't get developed at 325 because basically 325 ad was when it came forth that the the uh the man or whatever his name was it was two guys arguing over whether Jesus was God or a like substance all right that was the basic reason of the 325 ad and if you will get the 325 ad go in your in in your computer when you get home and run in 3:25 ad and read the announcement they made from that the proclamation and announcement was made from 3:25 ad that Jesus is the very substance of God but see they done got the idea planted into the man's mind you know by 606 had done developed right yep am I deep cuz I read that brother Dale he just how well why don't you go read it then you might find out that what I said's right but you see the Bible doesn't need no interpretation no man whatsoever ever has a right to interpret it come on listen if brother brandham had a right to interpret then he could have went to p on patmas and took that book you know what I'm talking about where John talking about who's worthy to take the book right come on you know what I'm talking about it's true you know that the biggest portion of people of this message believe brother brandom would have been worthy to went and took that book I say no sir re no man the Bible said was worthy the only one man that was worthy was the Lord Jesus Christ and he wouldn't have been worthy if he hadn't been God right oh yeah you know you know why I love to read the Bible I I like to think about the way people think you know and then I try to read you know Jesus was one in the Bible said there's none good no no one right right and why would he say that when he was the one good he knew fleshly speaking that the devil was working within those Realms of him that's right and there was nothing he could be tempted and tested there was nothing within that even though it was virgin born but it wasn't Eternal right amen see then he says there's nothing good no not one it wasn't degrading his own self he was telling it like it is that's right does that need to be interpreted no that needs to be believed right now come on you know we talk about we believe R random was the prophet and thank God we believe those things but yet he was not our God that's righten amen we don't worship him we don't have nothing with that that's right but we believe that God used a man to bring us a message right come on you out there anywhere listening where was anybody else for the message come on you got your o Rober you got your billy Grahams you got all of this that the other but where was one of them with a message oh yeah you got quotes you got doctrines you got ideas and and all the different things right but where was one of them to ever come with a message that's right right Billy Graham and asked him about the Trinity I read it one day from him you know what he said he said it can't be understood that's what he said amen you know what I agree with you there's no way to understand a trinity I agree with him 100% CU there three of them which one's oldest who created who that's not interpreted that's simply Plain Talk you understand what I'm getting there see we think that we have the interpretation come on I can quote to you brother R says we have the uh the interpretation in the divine revelation is that the word there's a quote similar to that we do why because God has brought it to us what is the interpretation of the Bible the word being fulfilled or Made Alive in somebody's life Mary was the interpretation of Genesis what 3:15 I'll put between thee and I I seeed you know between thy seed and the serpent seed well brother randam come to interpret that to us as being the serpent no it didn't the Bible done told us what it was that's right the Bible told us that it was the seed of The Serpent and the seed of God right that's not needing an interpretation right that's a believing God never said those things we made him say it by our own interpretation within ourselves right we made him say it when he never said it come on when the first seal broke the prophet said that white horse rider was the Antichrist right and City he rides off all we needed to know what the Antichrist was all we needed to know or should have known what the devil was right so what did the prophet come to explain 30 something years to get us to see one true and living God we'll see that more this afternoon when we'll see this message has to constantly talking about the Bible the Bible has constantly been unfolding itself to where you and I can see it and understand it we don't need anybody to interpret it we need somebody to live it brother BR was one that said it I didn't he said if God could get one man in his hands he said he can do it well how come we can't believe that that I'm one you know like we make the joke out of it and it's not a joke but brother said one out of state right right and you know what he said on that he didn't put it one out of a state that was a quote from a person expressing how small it would be right that's right but if there is just one out of state then y'all going to have to move cuz I'm here huh does that need to be interpreted now it needs y'all to move right but listen church I'm trying to be sensible about the word of God this is something my wife and I were talking about yesterday or day before one was riding see it doesn't need to be interpreted it needs somebody to believe it and to believe it we had to have somebody to explain it there's where your prophets and your people come in the Bible was not rewrote when Luther come out and said to J shall live by faith it's what God had already said the disciples understood that right your disciples understood the just shall live by faith that's right that was not a new doctrine that Luther got it was a bringing back of the word of God that the disciples already understood but that mankind had taken away why because he started interpreting it and expressing his own ideas you see church we talk about that we're in the word you know we talk about we're in the word you see I I've been studying this message for 50 years this year because I heard of the message 1966 50 years of studying this message right what about it we've had 50 years almost a prophet gone right but yet we don't know what the prophet has taught us cuz we're still trying to find some interpretation it's like I told you you remember what happened back a few years ago when they found 40 24 tapes that brother randam of messages that they didn't know existed yes well you know everybody wanted them 24 tapes well I did too but you know why most people wanted those 24 tape they thought some secret thing was going to be revealed and had been withholden from the bride of Christ until a certain time right no I just knew it' fit with the rest of it right right but one is deep see we talk about somebody preaching and say but but they're deep that means you don't understand cuz deep is simple right that brother's deep what do you mean deep I didn't know the word cat change languag is from Deep to shallow right I mean it's deep how do you spell cat and deep he said that's silly I know it's silly cuz that's the way our thoughts are we think something is deep like I told you about the brother told that time he said that statue of perfect man he said that adoption one of the way or the other that adoption is simple but said that statue of perfect man is deep well it's the same thing right we only make it deep because we're making it to where God cannot reveal it as I said how many times did Martin Luther preach the just shall live by faith right boy that's a deep thought then one day it struck him and God revealed it he said Glory Hallelujah that's what the whole Bible says he wasn't just arguing over one quote he tackled the world over that one scripture now listen you know what if he was right and we do believe he was right right now not all all of his things that he preached were going with it but if we believe that the just shall live by faith why are we still trying to explain it right right what does it mean there well we believe it means this but why can't we read like I said Matthew 5:2 548 where it says be ye therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect does that need to be interpreted no it's a fact that needs to be believed that's now to explain that we looked up the word and not done that in the Baptist Church I looked up the word perfect and I found out then that the word perfect means complete in a full age what was that not an interpretation but an explanation see that's what we need we need explanation right we've got to have explanation right but we can only have interpretation by explanations being revealed see when something is revealed into your life can the devil take it away from you now if it's revealed well does it need to be interpreted no you might try to explain it yes but it doesn't need to be interpreted the Virgin shall conceive doesn't need to be interpreted it needed somebody to make it alive now may I quote brother brandom every scripture in this Bible has been made Alive by someone cuz that's what it is what is the book that Wade's talking about in the Sunday School that was in the hand of the one sitting on the throne and they went and took a book was it a Thompson Chain a Scofield or a you know what I mean they come in existence a couple of hundred years or less than that for the SC field and the Thompson chains but King James versions or whatever was it a book setting there I thought that this Bible was a list of names of believers right I thought when it said Paul Peter James John that that was Believers that don't need to be interpreted does it it's Believers am then what was he taking a book cuz remember what he was taken was what went back before the foundation of world right where'd it go back to to him who gave it it didn't go to sat cuz he couldn't take it amen he went back to the one who gave it am right you see Church we're not taking it as being that we the message has come not to explain I mean not to interpret thing but to express what God has in his mind that's right amen you know what God had in his mind before the foundation of world had you we agree with that but see we get into it well but see we've been taught we've been taught in Old on that point right there see we'd say well your name was written in the lounge book of life before the foundation world I heard it explained that my name was written when I joined that church that's my interpretation that's a good old Baptist Doctrine that's right right lot of them believe old primi especially free wills and that when they wrote that name on that card that you joined that church that day your name was written in heaven that ain't never been in the Bible nowh whatsoever if it was written the Bible said it was written before the foundation of the world that's right it don't need to be interpreted does it nor to be believed that's right now explaining right see then we can explain the reason it's written there is because God would look down and see all of the names and that would be his people upon the Earth and that would be put in a book right that's explaining it okay retitle the message brother Joe take that off of review and preview put on there what explaining it cuz listen church what good does it do for us to have a message what good does it do for us to have a Bible if we don't believe it can be understood right now May I won't say what I just thought God wouldn't be so messed up would he I was going to say he wouldn't be too dumb but he wouldn't be so messed up as to not know everything right if there is a God if that's the way you believe him if you don't believe him that way that he knows all things then go ahead and forget it right but if he knows all things then he knew what we would do down through time and how we would do with our own ideas and how man would become so departed away right cuz listen folks let me take one explanation to get you to think the Bible says the cankerworm palmerworm Locust and caterpillar right over in Joel it would eat the thing down to a stump right right right they don't need interpreted what does it need to be done canor pal worm Locust caterpillar is the four stages of one bug what's the one bug plain language the devil in his doctrines and ideas right that don't need no interpreting right that means facts we just take an example of P canor pomor Locus caterpillar and explain it as a bug that's eating right cuz that was what was explained to the prophet all right now then we know that the four stages ate it down and we know there's four stages to Restoration right the bugs that ate it down what was it Luther brought the just shall live my faith Wesley brought sanctification right the Pentecostals brought the baptism of the Holy Spirit right and then what was the lies to be is the word or seed right come on to that to four stages back to the word pure unadulterated word all right then that means that Luther Wesley and Pentecost and the Holy Ghost was in the restoration to bring it back to us that don't need interpreting does it right that just needs to believe it neither does it need to be interpreted when your Prophet will say this way he takes those four stages of that bug and he brings it back to the word then he starts again and what does he say he said what the Lutheran left the Methodist ate Y what the Methodist lay the Pentecostals at does that need an interpretation we didn't need the interpretation to come up to the G War pal Locus cill we need an interpretation for the other can't you just plainly see what's he saying what the Methodist what the Lutheran left the Methodist ate up you see where our ideas is what's killing us that's why you turned in from the fact of restoration with Luther Wesley and Pentecost in the word and you turn back to what's called Reformation I'm just saying some things brother R said to illustrate that they don't need to be interpreted they need to be believed that's why they say you're so deep deep of what when a prophet has already explain the local cankerworm palor worm and all that and what they ate down and how God uses Luther Wesley and Pentecost and the word of God to restore then he drops right back down and says you people of this end time message have ate away you took your Lutheran ideas your Methodist ideas your Pentecostal ideas you've ate it down till it's a stump again right does that need to be interpreted no but you know what it needs somebody to do to believe it that's right and believe that we've had an opportunity that others have not had because we can believe the word of Truth to be right amen not an interpretation of it an expressing of what God has done to bring you and I to a place that we must we must believe his word and what he said ain't talking about just his word I believe what Martin Luther taught he taught the just shall live by faith I believe that I believe John Wesley taught sanctification I believe that and I believe in it I believe the Pentecostals come with the restoration of the gifts I believe in that and I believe the Prophet come to bring us back to the word now listen not to bring a word but to bring us back to the word because the word was already there that's right y amen remember they said to brother brandom with your ability said you could write a 13th wasn't it 23rd chapter of Revelation they told him with his ability he could do that what did he say Oh Glory Hallelujah they think I'm something boy I'm something I've got this so much with God that I can write what did he say he said you can't do that because you can't add one word said if you add one word to this Bible God will add the plagues that are written in this book and if you take away one word from this book he said he'll take your name out of the book that's the Bible says that brother Ram never come to bring us some kind of a thing that we think has got to be interpreted when the Holy Spirit revealed to that Prophet to that white horse rider remember he thought the white horse rider was the Holy Ghost and taught the white horse rider was the Holy Ghost right but one day God showed him the truth that the one horse rider was the Antichrist he said I would have made a horrible mistake had the Holy Spirit not come in the room to straighten me out he was an honest man speaking of honest things and thinking about the truth we don't need nobody to interpret for us folks sure we need help we need somebody to explain it right somebody to study it out and find where the Prophet said this and the prophet said that that's right what do you need anything else to explain now there's so much Doctrine let's see let me hit one in a hurry uh so many doctrines about the New Birth I've been through that series part and in it you know one believes it's the Born Again One Believes a baptism One Believes it's this one believes it's that I asked brother brandham one day now I didn't see him and do it I was sitting praying and I said Lord that Prophet this way on back it's got to be the one to tell us and give us understanding about the New Birth so what is the new birth well you know what I didn't go to all of these other places to try to find out you know where I went I tyed it in or I didn't type it in then because as the old days before we had that but I just simply asked the question surely somewhere there's a definite answer to this thing one day I was reading Christ The Mystery of God reveal and there it was brother R said what is the new birth then okay now whatever you think it is whatever you got your idea idea that's your interpretation that's your conception right when you ask ask a man what it is he says what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost then brother random he said it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you well you know what I ain't never had no problems with understanding the new birth I don't care how many explains all of their Concepts of ideas and things but if it don't come back to that statement then they are wrong and I don't mind telling them that I thought it was supposed to be that the prophet said that he'd be glad when we come to the basis that we would look people in the eye and say you're not saying what brother Bram said that's not th right the quote is what that you're not saying what Paul said right that's right but am I deep or this because that I've studied the message and got the answers from the prophet himself as he tried to not interpret that but explain it now watch the interpretation Was Made Real in his heart right with a man that live beyond beond reproach now there was some things he's human beings he wasn't perfect right but a man that lived a life as he did until no one not any of his uh there's never been anything written about him that was derogatory other than he was wrong on the word none of them would attacked his life you know how I know then he had the new birth because he told me what it was and that was what was in his life do you understand what I'm getting now one day a virgin said be it unto me according to Thy word let that be in my heart that's answer right and you know what it was you know what was her new birth not right then she didn't get the new birth right then right but what held her until she went to the upper room was that statement and that was 33 years later and her new birth was be it unto me because you believed it what is your new birth I shouted I cried I spoke in tongue I didn't ask you that that's right what is your new birth if we believe the new birth is a birth of the word then how can you have a new birth with all the false Concepts that I've done about it why not just relax folks and just read the word of God and listen to it I don't listen the tapes so run around them to find something secret oh oh did you hear that oo boy no you don't think it but I listen for one thing for him to show me Christ that's supposed to be in my heart and how that is to be within me I'm not looking for secret things The Greatest Secret of all is that God could save Mankind from his sins that God could bring us a word that doesn't need to be interpreted but needs to be believed if you can't understand something why don't you simply pray but listen now listen to the point before you pray well you ought to pray first you ain't listening before you pray why don't you look down in front of you at the letters on the page that Bible is telling you exactly the truth right why don't you read the book to see what's being said why don't you study brother Brown's message that way that's right I love to hear him explain his uh personal experience don't you amen of the things in his life in his personal experiences we were up at a certain brother I won't call his name cuz I'm trying to get away from putting names out cuz people don't like it but we were up at a certain brother's place one time and and he was showing us around in the area where he lived there were places that brother random had been and we went to the place where the old two old men sitting out under the old apple tree and we still got some apples in our refrigerator to house off that apple tree you know because it was momentos to me I've got rocks from over place in in Israel until the plane was like this flying back and brother George after me all the time about it but after a while that brother was riding along I said brother I said I'd like to hear your experience amen and I I you know i' like to see where you lived or things you've been through in your life you know what it shocked him I guess because people probably wouldn't ask him those things but he cared us around then and showed us places I'm interested in your experiences I love to get notes and I do from the people all the time explaining something I love to read what you have to say I like to read what's in your life now let me finish it by saying what how is it that I check a Doctrine how many of you remember that some of you heard me saying it for 40 years right you ought to remember it how is it that I check a Doctrine well I go into the Bible and the prophets message praise God I do too that's sensible but how do I really check a Doctrine by my own experience of Jesus Christ because anything else can be uh interpreted by Satan well I I look the person in the eye that's a good old Pentecostal you know I look him in the eye and I discern that spirit I never known but one way to discern a spirit I mean come on folks God gets out and shoot somebody he's a devil we don't have to have that interpreted do we but what are you talking about it's not to look somebody in the eye to see what kind of a demon it is check him by the word that's all you got to do it's just ask him about the word you know what he'll tell you a whole lot more than his eyeballs tells you cuz you can be deceived with all them things would you won't be deceived by the word of God so when somebody says brother Dale deep said brother Dale just explained the other day that he was the most simple man in the world I believe that that's not exalted stat that's a truth because everything that has ever been revealed to me has took me to my knees and say God you didn't owe me that you gave it to me you know yourself that I've come here many many many times and told you Lord met me yesterday to explain this you know what I didn't have it today before see we don't need an interpreter we have the one who wrote it right we need to somebody to explain things yes because that's part of our human life may I say it again you don't go down into a college and and learn learn how to interpret how to operate you learn by experience from somebody who can teach you how to do it that's right right so let's get away from that thought of it's we need an interpretation no we need God to reveal we need and thank God for those who try to help us by explaining it I like what brother Woodby said one time about it he said a little old wash woman it can't write her name don't know nothing so she can help you if she's got the Holy Ghost right right you know if they got the Holy Ghost they got something real that's right right come on musicians yall cutting up is number one there's a there something on my mind that try to get you to think rightly to let God reveal himself to you and I there's the opening of the word then could we be as Mary and say be it unto me according to Thy word that's it right there right that's my answer there is the interp ation what she said was made manifest into her body right then right let stand what we got brother 389 389 when like a anybody have a need think about [Music] it God just wants somebody to believe his word whatever my Lord th has taught me to say it is well it is well with I my soul It Is Well with My Soul It is Well it Is Well with My [Music] Soul though Satan should B though Tri should come let this bless assur us control that Christ has for his wife Lord made a great statement before the confirming of your word and now just let your word go forth and touch our sister take away that hurting from her leg and knee and all Lord we believe it we thank you in Jesus name anybody else that has a need my soul it is it is [Music] well can you say that my can you say well the and no matter what goes come or what happens GL all is well my S not in part but the whole his na to the cross and I bear it no more praise the Lord praise the Lord my soul sing it into it it Is Well with My Soul It is Well it Is Well with My Soul father we thank you for an opportunity today and we just pray that what we said would be right to give us understanding Lord because all we're trying to do is let you speak to our hearts and our lives that you could bring us to the place that we could be what you want us to be Lord forgive our sins because we know that we fail you and Lord we have many many problems in our lives that we need cleansing of just come and do that Lord and take away those wrong thoughts and ideas that would be in any of our thoughts any of our ways that would be contrary to you and just let everything be in you Lord and then we can see truly how simple that your word really is it don't need nobody to interpret it it needs somebody to believe it we're in the end time Lord that don't need an interpretation we know we're here and we're it's finishing up Lord we just ask you to guide each one of us go with us as we go now to eat a natural meal come back this evening with us and bless us and keep us in Jesus name amen you dismiss pray one for another and Lord haste a day when my face shall beide the clouds be roll back as a scoll the trump it shall ReSound and the Lord shall
