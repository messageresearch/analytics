[2:29] started
[2:33] so don is on okay so good to be back I
[2:36] really enjoyed the
[2:38] service this morning
[2:40] and I learned something new said
[2:42] patience was not mentioned in the Old
[2:44] Testament
[2:45] and now it kind of shows you that you
[2:48] need the holy spirit in your life to
[2:50] have patience patience with God patience
[2:52] with your family patients with your job
[2:54] patient with different things and that's
[2:56] such a revelation because
[2:59] you know you're thinking the Old
[3:00] Testament there's so much killing maybe
[3:01] people didn't have much patience with
[3:04] each other but the Holy Spirit really
[3:06] tempers all of that so let them come
[3:08] into your heart tonight you know
[3:10] there's just a song here we're going to
[3:12] sing and then I'll probably sing a
[3:13] Praise Chorus after but it's just
[3:16] in everything give thanks whatever is
[3:18] going on in your life just give thanks

[3:54] man decide

[30:55] and that word was made flesh and dwelt
[30:58] Among Us
[31:00] and we behold his glory the glory the
[31:02] only begotten of the father
[31:04] full of grace
[31:06] and Truth the world didn't see that did
[31:08] they the world saw him as Belgium the
[31:11] world saw him as a instigator and uh and
[31:14] all these different things but today
[31:17] by our faith we see he's our savior
[31:20] he's our healer he's Our Redeemer and
[31:23] now he doesn't reside somewhere else he
[31:25] resides inside of you by the baptism of
[31:27] the Holy Ghost
[31:28] an intimate relationship
[31:30] a Divine Romance
[31:33] that we're coming to more and more
[31:35] that we're not going to be separated
[31:37] from him ever again when we
[31:40] go to our future home
[31:43] what a great thing
[31:45] that we just have a little time down
[31:46] here that he give us
[31:48] to learn more about him and then we go
[31:50] there and we've got an eternity to learn
[31:52] more about him we'll never ever quit
[31:55] learning about our Lord
[31:57] II Peter 1 besides this giving all
[31:59] diligence
[32:00] add to your faith virtue in the verse
[32:02] your knowledge it's our knowledge
[32:03] temperance
[32:04] to Temperance patience to patience
[32:06] godliness into godliness brotherly
[32:08] kindness and the brotherly kindness
[32:10] charity you may be seated in the Lord as
[32:12] blessing will continue a little bit as
[32:14] we were this morning the Bible says in
[32:16] first Timothy 3 16 it says when without
[32:19] controversy great is a mystery of
[32:21] godliness God was manifested in the
[32:24] flesh justified in the spirit scene of
[32:26] angels preached unto the Gentiles
[32:28] believes on the world received up in the
[32:29] glory that just pretty much took his
[32:31] whole life
[32:32] that ever ever been to that Soul without
[32:34] controversy we know or without dispute
[32:37] we know as we were talking this morning
[32:39] we know the mystery of God
[32:43] one mystery and what is that great
[32:46] mystery though
[32:48] it's not Jesus two thousand years ago
[32:50] it's not Jesus in the life's Church age
[32:54] it's costing you
[32:56] the hope of glory and what we want to do
[32:58] is we got a theme here at our church and
[33:00] what we've been saying since the first
[33:02] of the of the Year whatever you got
[33:04] inside of you let it out
[33:07] if it's good Let it out and show others
[33:10] if it's bad get it out so God can get in
[33:13] but we need to let out and listen raise
[33:15] your hands more shout more
[33:19] that's what you need to let out
[33:22] because this great Plan of Redemption
[33:24] listen there's no greater plan
[33:27] there's plans the
[33:31] you know you got to uh the zuckerbergs
[33:34] and all those that started with Facebook
[33:35] and just a little something on his
[33:37] computer
[33:38] now he's a multi-billionaire and
[33:41] everybody's on Facebook except for my
[33:43] mom and daddy
[33:45] and brother Donnie
[33:47] and some of us troll we look over our
[33:49] wives shoulder don't we secret Sinners
[33:51] just be careful
[33:53] ah
[33:56] I'm one
[33:59] you know what
[34:01] we like information though we're just
[34:03] just as an Information Age everybody
[34:04] likes information
[34:06] you know it kind of borderlines on
[34:08] gossip but you're pretty close but but
[34:11] we see that Zuckerberg though had a plan
[34:12] though and I don't think though his plan
[34:14] was to go Global or to go worldwide in
[34:17] it for it just to be a multi-billion
[34:19] dollar company I just can't understand
[34:21] in the end time let me tell you how
[34:22] fooled we are
[34:24] now this ain't got nothing to do with
[34:26] them going this direction right now but
[34:28] you take somebody like Henry Ford
[34:31] now Henry Ford in early 1900s
[34:36] put together a Model A or Model T what
[34:40] do you do first a or t t
[34:42] because because the frame look like a t
[34:44] well what happened was he could put all
[34:46] that together like we do a puzzle and he
[34:49] could sell it to the masses of people
[34:51] all right well that was a good and
[34:53] service right that was a hard uh there
[34:55] was a plant my dad used to work at
[34:57] General Motors 100 acres underneath the
[34:59] roof it took you forever to get from one
[35:00] end to the other because we'd have open
[35:02] houses and we'd get to go see them but
[35:05] Henry Ford built a he bought a piece of
[35:07] property and he put a plant there and he
[35:09] put people to work there and he produced
[35:11] a good
[35:13] and showed it to the people and you can
[35:14] see that with your eye you tell me how
[35:16] Facebook got sold for over a billion
[35:18] dollars and it ain't nothing but
[35:20] something on your computer
[35:23] have you not thought about that
[35:26] Google all these different things there
[35:28] is no hard
[35:29] something that you're going to take and
[35:31] sell a service to somebody get some
[35:34] money for it take it back and have this
[35:36] you know this Factory
[35:38] you see how the mind is now you know how
[35:40] Satan's got in the mind to people you're
[35:42] buying something you can't even see
[35:47] you're buying something you can't even
[35:49] see
[35:50] show me where Facebook produces all this
[35:53] no
[35:55] same way with the devil that's what he's
[35:57] doing he's throwing all these things in
[35:58] and we have it has no substance remember
[36:00] hell has no Foundation
[36:02] hell has no bottom to I mean it's just
[36:04] keeps going
[36:05] so that's what Facebook and all that is
[36:07] based on the world is based on something
[36:09] they're selling you something you can't
[36:11] see you can't it's not tangible you
[36:13] can't get in it and drive it that's
[36:14] right it's just out here in the air
[36:16] somewhere
[36:17] and if y'all didn't know it the
[36:19] government sells their time
[36:21] did y'all know that since I work for the
[36:24] federal government
[36:25] I know that
[36:26] they sell airtime what is that
[36:29] is it like this much going through the
[36:31] building like this I mean so you're
[36:33] you're selling something you don't even
[36:35] you can't it's not tangible but you and
[36:37] I folks let me tell you something when
[36:39] you get to baptism of the Holy Ghost you
[36:41] might not be able to have a hard copy
[36:44] but you got a copy inside of you
[36:47] and that copy inside of you does what
[36:49] it's a good and a service that you give
[36:51] to somebody else I said oh you're full
[36:54] yeah some of you we're all full of it
[36:55] sometimes
[36:57] but I want to be full of God
[36:59] so full of God that he burst out and it
[37:01] gets on somebody else and he gets on
[37:03] your neighbor and it gets on your
[37:04] co-workers and it gets on the people
[37:06] driving down the road even
[37:08] let's look at this real quick because
[37:10] we're going to talk about this for a
[37:11] minute
[37:12] and this comes from a question that came
[37:15] up maybe a couple weeks ago where that
[37:18] somebody online said that uh you know
[37:21] that the free moral agency in the
[37:23] message in other words was out we just
[37:25] don't believe in free moral agency uh
[37:27] you were this predestinated uh you you
[37:30] always were an eagle I believe that
[37:33] but what are you going to do
[37:36] about where brother Brown says you
[37:37] always were wheat
[37:39] but I've got about 16 cloves back there
[37:41] that brother Brown said you were a
[37:42] kookaburra
[37:46] is that Prophet that confused
[37:48] we are confused if there's any confusion
[37:51] it's us
[37:52] because I believe he believed in
[37:54] old-fashioned repentance he believed in
[37:57] old-fashioned snot-slinging repentance
[38:00] at the altar amen
[38:02] get an experience with God not just come
[38:04] and sit in the church and say well I
[38:06] must be all right because I believed
[38:08] brother Branham was a prophet the devil
[38:10] believes that
[38:12] remember the Bible says the devil
[38:13] believes in one God and trembles that's
[38:15] right
[38:16] the world believes in three
[38:19] Romans 8 28 I kind of broke this down a
[38:21] little bit let's look at this just for a
[38:23] second
[38:23] you may think it has nothing to do with
[38:25] this but it really does
[38:28] yeah because listen there's a group of
[38:30] people that he saw come to a stature
[38:32] our heater never put it in the Bible
[38:35] to come to the perfecting of the Saints
[38:37] all right by the fivefold ministry buy
[38:40] alive God in human flesh speaking to you
[38:44] all right for whom he did what number
[38:47] one for no
[38:50] all right 4-0 means to have knowledge
[38:54] before it happens
[38:57] only God can do that
[39:01] PC all down your life in just a Split
[39:03] Second
[39:04] he can see actually several billion
[39:06] people's lives in just a split second
[39:07] because we don't understand God
[39:10] but those he did who he did one for no
[39:13] what'd he do then then he did
[39:16] predestinate them
[39:17] everybody with me there to be conformed
[39:20] to the image of his son that he might be
[39:23] the first born among many Brethren
[39:24] moreover whom he did what number two go
[39:27] back to number two the ones he did
[39:28] predestinate in other words the ones he
[39:30] foreknew that he saw then he
[39:32] predetermined a place for us to be
[39:37] I don't mean a place I'm talking about
[39:39] your place where you're at
[39:41] them also he what called number three
[39:46] and whom he called
[39:48] number four
[39:49] and whom he justified he glorified oh
[39:53] thank God for g-r-a-c-e thank God for
[39:56] those five moves of God in your life he
[39:59] foreknew you he predestinated you he
[40:02] called you he justified you and if he's
[40:06] Justified you remember he can't change
[40:08] his mind
[40:09] he's already glorified you
[40:11] what Grace
[40:13] grace Amazing Grace So for knowledge
[40:17] brother Brown now explains it looks back
[40:19] and says that he foresaw this and knows
[40:23] that's the reason he could tell what was
[40:25] in from the beginning thereby with me
[40:28] and therefore knowing that all these
[40:30] marvelous days that we're living in now
[40:32] and to stand and witness like I said
[40:34] before to be pressurized to be able to
[40:36] stand this
[40:38] to be able to overcome this lay out a
[40:41] sea of this the darkest age it ever was
[40:44] he put you in it for a purpose
[40:47] Amen to make it not to fail God's never
[40:50] failed
[40:51] you and I fail all the time but God
[40:53] doesn't now listen what we need to do
[40:54] like brother Ernie said plug ourselves
[40:56] into that
[40:57] plug yourself into that we're plugged
[41:01] into the Eternal if we're born again
[41:02] today now let's plug ourselves into
[41:04] these virtues and let's start let God
[41:06] live through our life
[41:09] all these marvelous days that we're
[41:10] living in to stand and witness see we're
[41:13] witnessing what brother random for for
[41:15] from 1930 something 40 something to to
[41:18] 1965 when God took him off the scene he
[41:21] prophesied he was a prophet he said this
[41:23] is coming this is coming that's coming
[41:25] this is going to show up that's going to
[41:26] show up this is where the animal do you
[41:28] have a problem knowing where the
[41:29] Antichrist is
[41:31] the world is guessing they think it's
[41:33] the number 666 they think it's
[41:36] Zuckerberg or they think it's it's
[41:38] always rich people
[41:40] it's always rich people either Bill
[41:43] Gates or his wife or somebody is a you
[41:45] know or a bezo he's the he's an
[41:47] antichrist because he's got your money
[41:50] and he's a multi-billionaire
[41:53] they ain't got one thing to do with it
[41:56] the Antichrist is unbelieving God's word
[41:59] not believing the word of God but it's
[42:03] all going to head into a person though
[42:04] but praise God you and I are not going
[42:06] to be here according to what the prophet
[42:08] tells us
[42:09] all right so see we can praise God for
[42:12] that that we don't have to go looking
[42:13] for an antichrist we don't have to know
[42:16] when he's going to show up he's already
[42:17] here
[42:18] hey man everybody with me
[42:21] so now look he witnessed these things
[42:23] and God had to make a preparation for it
[42:25] so he made a way for all of us to get
[42:28] right here where we're at tonight
[42:30] but now let me ask you a question
[42:32] as some are saying in the message of the
[42:34] hour that we came here with this eternal
[42:37] seed and there was no way we could we we
[42:38] just never sinned I'm with you to a
[42:42] degree but watch this right here let's
[42:44] listen to what a prophet said
[42:45] impersonation of Christianity that's a
[42:48] good one to listen to
[42:49] now how can that come about if God
[42:54] without us
[42:57] on let's talk about this morning what
[42:59] listen to his verbiage listen to what
[43:01] he's saying if God made me a man and put
[43:04] me up at my right age before our death
[43:07] set in for knowledge
[43:09] at about 23 years old I was strong and
[43:11] helped him if Satan didn't interfere
[43:14] that didn't interfere he tried to
[43:16] me remember shot his legs off
[43:17] and all that stuff shoot me down many
[43:19] things
[43:20] but God's seen so in you when you were
[43:23] young and when you were pretty you women
[43:25] just got old and you men who were young
[43:27] and strong and healthy how you enjoyed
[43:29] being a man and your little companion if
[43:31] God did that without you having any say
[43:33] into it you said make me thus
[43:36] but take any thought could add one cubit
[43:38] to a stature
[43:40] but if he made you thus without you
[43:42] having anything to say now if you
[43:44] stopped right there you could see where
[43:46] brother Brown would or people would say
[43:48] that God pulled you through it too
[43:49] because he saw that then as it was going
[43:50] to be but watch continue on let's listen
[43:54] without you having anything to say how
[43:56] much more can he through his Beauty
[43:58] brooding give you a choice
[44:03] and you're on the basis of free moral
[44:05] agency you can turn this down
[44:10] or you can accept it
[44:12] everybody believe program was a prophet
[44:15] some of you don't you know there's a
[44:16] church over there if you need to go to
[44:18] it
[44:19] I believe that Prophet folks I'm telling
[44:21] you people have lambasted him and shot
[44:23] him down I believe brother Brown was a
[44:24] prophet of God Amen and I believe his
[44:27] voice is what's going to either take us
[44:30] into Rapture or condemn us at the day of
[44:32] judgment you got to choose which one
[44:34] to turn it down is to be lost oh choice
[44:37] and remain potassium petroleum but to
[44:41] accept it and have a new heart a new
[44:44] spirit and his Spirit part of the logos
[44:47] in you controlling your emotions and
[44:49] when he Coos through his word look you
[44:51] cool back
[44:53] and answer to him I got one down here I
[44:56] want you to hold on to your britches
[44:59] you'll you'll you you just wait
[45:02] way back before there was a light on the
[45:04] earth our bodies Laden the dust amen
[45:07] sure we are made from the dust out of
[45:10] the potassium calcium petroleum and
[45:12] Cosmic light God sent forth the great
[45:14] Holy Spirit to brood over the Earth and
[45:16] as he Brews the little flowers began to
[45:18] come up the birds flew out animals came
[45:20] from the Earth
[45:21] and then come a man but look and he
[45:25] sinned
[45:26] and separated himself from the
[45:28] fellowship of his God so whatever that
[45:31] God had right here
[45:33] man broke the Covenant so now it's down
[45:36] here
[45:37] that's why God couldn't swear by no
[45:39] greater he swore by himself I'm going to
[45:41] do this plan I made this plan I'm going
[45:44] to see it through I can't depend on this
[45:46] guy to do it
[45:47] everybody with me
[45:49] but where do we put our dependency
[45:50] brother Ryan said back on this guy
[45:53] the one that said I'll do it
[45:56] now look
[45:57] and because of this horrible thing he
[46:00] was commanded by God to return back to
[46:02] the dust of the earth oh Lord God we are
[46:04] so glad that before he returns you have
[46:07] a problem you promised a redeemer
[46:09] and today since he has come and sent
[46:11] forth the Holy Spirit again and now he's
[46:14] still brooding over the dust our bodies
[46:16] and if he raised me and brought me to
[46:18] what I am now without having a choice
[46:21] now you go whoa wait man brother Brown
[46:22] we know what he's bringing the human guy
[46:25] here
[46:26] human guy dust yes your soul is not dust
[46:30] that's right
[46:31] it's your body
[46:33] and if he raised me and brought me to
[46:35] what I am now without having a choice
[46:38] how much more will he raise us from the
[46:40] dust of the earth after we've made a
[46:44] choice
[46:45] after we've made a choice and he has
[46:48] brewed it to us and we brewed back to
[46:51] him
[46:52] that Divine Romance I was talking about
[46:54] this morning we love him now this one
[46:56] right here I want you to hold on to your
[46:57] britches
[46:59] you ready
[47:02] oh not this one
[47:04] then oh yes it is here we go you ready
[47:06] 1959 brother Brown was still coherent
[47:09] he's doing what he was talking about
[47:11] okie dokie it's before the sales but
[47:13] we're good
[47:16] Lord Jesus
[47:17] just as Ellie's are watched that sign on
[47:20] the girl you'll have to watch the sign
[47:22] of the church because Jesus did said I
[47:25] don't care what man said I know men say
[47:27] those days in Miracle just passed all
[47:29] this stuff and don't pass and gone by no
[47:31] more
[47:33] now you've got to make a choice
[47:35] Jesus said let every word man's word be
[47:38] a lie and mine be the truth
[47:40] now you've got to make up your mind
[47:46] I'm holding that bottom part
[47:48] you've got to make a choice
[47:52] and this may
[47:56] just make a choice
[47:58] tomorrow may be too late watch this
[48:02] God might have chose you to eternal life
[48:07] but if you don't make up your mind and
[48:09] accept it somebody else will take your
[48:12] place
[48:19] yeah but I was just great yeah in the
[48:21] mind of God we we have never been not
[48:23] great
[48:24] in the mind of God the Genesis 1 26 man
[48:27] never fell
[48:28] because that's our typos that's what the
[48:30] Holy Ghost is it's it's our theophany
[48:32] it's the it's God in us by the Holy
[48:36] Ghost all right but God might have chose
[48:38] you to eternal life let me read that one
[48:40] more time I want you to make sure I'm
[48:41] gonna leave it up there so it'll burn
[48:43] but if you don't make up your mind and
[48:46] accept it somebody else will take your
[48:49] place
[48:52] I didn't make that up if you want to
[48:54] read it go back to 1959
[48:57] 418 a time of decision Los Angeles
[49:00] California
[49:02] that's what the prophet of God said to
[49:04] me when I saw that man that just that
[49:07] just made it just nailed put the nail in
[49:09] the coffin as the old saying says
[49:11] you have a choice if you don't want
[49:13] eternal life God's gonna give it to
[49:15] somebody who does
[49:17] but remember go back to foreknowledge he
[49:19] foreknew who wouldn't who wouldn't
[49:21] therefore he could predetermine and put
[49:24] it in your path
[49:26] put it in your path to make a decision
[49:30] now back part
[49:32] of God's mind let's go back into there
[49:34] now we got to go back in the back part
[49:35] of God's mind there was something he was
[49:37] trying and going to achieve and he had a
[49:39] motive in doing it in order to let him
[49:42] be expressed and we remember there's
[49:43] more who is he expressed through he's
[49:45] expressed through us
[49:46] all right he's expressed through us
[49:50] First Corinthians 1 7.
[49:54] so that you come behind in no gift
[49:55] waiting for the coming of Our Lord who
[49:57] shall also confirm you
[50:00] unto the end that you may be blameless
[50:02] and the day of our Lord Jesus Christ
[50:05] First Corinthians 6 and I know you not
[50:07] to the unrighteous shall not inherit the
[50:08] kingdom of God be not this evening the
[50:10] fornicators idolter we'll go read about
[50:12] this same group in just a minute that's
[50:13] why I'm reading it now we're going to
[50:15] read another scripture talks about the
[50:16] same group of people
[50:18] the fornicators idolators adulterers
[50:20] effeminate abusers themselves of mankind
[50:22] if you want to look all them up
[50:24] that's not your Sunday school teachers
[50:26] and preachers
[50:27] nor thieves and our Covetous it is now
[50:29] once you get born again nor thieves now
[50:31] Covetous nor drunkers nor revilers nor
[50:33] extortioners shall inherit the kingdom
[50:35] of God and such for some of you
[50:37] but you are washed you are Sanctified
[50:39] you are justified in the name of the
[50:41] Lord Jesus and by the spirit amen of our
[50:43] God Philippians 2 15 that you may be
[50:46] blameless now wait a minute
[50:48] there's a lot of blame right there in
[50:50] verse 9 and 10.
[50:52] a lot of
[50:54] a lot of nine and ten
[50:55] but he washes it all away in verse 11.
[50:59] anybody with me thank God for Grace
[51:02] amen
[51:04] I claimed Grace I told you all the other
[51:06] day and I will tell you again for some
[51:07] of our friends that are here that hadn't
[51:09] heard
[51:10] listen if you have not had grace
[51:12] extended to you you can't extend Grace
[51:13] to somebody else
[51:16] you'll be a law-abider you'll be
[51:18] somebody that looks and and condemns
[51:21] until you get Grace
[51:24] you get Grace in your heart it'll soften
[51:26] you up
[51:27] it'll make you realize what brother
[51:30] Brown Say when we get to brotherly
[51:32] kindness one of my favorite quotes he
[51:34] said put yourself in that brother's
[51:36] place
[51:37] put yourself in that brother's shoes or
[51:39] that sister's shoes that's why I told
[51:41] you here we go with A Life Lesson again
[51:43] this may be for the ones in Macon
[51:45] so
[51:49] if you go to a restaurant don't give the
[51:51] waitress a hard time you just not know
[51:53] you don't know what she's going through
[51:55] you don't know what he's going through
[51:57] be kind to people
[51:59] well they got to be kind that's not what
[52:01] the Bible says
[52:03] the Bible didn't say because I'm kind to
[52:06] you you've got to be kind to me or vice
[52:07] versa
[52:09] brotherly kindness is loving somebody
[52:11] that hates you
[52:13] hate you it's easy to love somebody
[52:15] loves you
[52:16] but somebody that totally despises you
[52:18] you love them and you love them with the
[52:21] love of the Lord why because you want to
[52:22] see them saved
[52:24] I want to see those people saved and I
[52:26] give them all a 20 tip you can do
[52:29] whatever you want to
[52:30] but I tip them because that's their
[52:32] wages
[52:33] and you know what if they're not having
[52:34] a good day guess what if you were living
[52:36] off of that and you had a bad day
[52:43] would you want somebody to take your
[52:44] wages away from you just cause yeah one
[52:45] bad day just a bad day
[52:47] all right that's life lesson number 345.
[52:51] so patience
[52:53] it's not in the Old Testament
[52:55] Moses didn't have patience
[52:58] sure he might have had a little bit
[52:59] but patience lack of it's what got him
[53:02] in trouble remember he smoked a rock
[53:03] instead of speaking to the Rock
[53:06] he said you what a bunch of rebels you
[53:08] could see the fire in his eyes
[53:10] but in the New Testament through the
[53:12] filter of the Holy Ghost it gives you
[53:14] patience
[53:15] the Bible says in your patience possess
[53:18] ye your soul
[53:20] we'll read that in just a minute we'll
[53:22] get to it all right statue perfect man
[53:23] let's just keep going
[53:25] you're beginning to reflect the works of
[53:26] Christ in other words we're getting on
[53:27] up here a little bit further we're
[53:28] getting up to patience so many of us try
[53:31] to do the works of Christ before the
[53:32] reflection of Christ is in US listen we
[53:34] always see that we always see people
[53:36] that like Dad always said somebody
[53:37] burning candle at both ends you know
[53:39] house on fire and windy day they come up
[53:41] here and they sit on the front row and
[53:42] all they do is they're doing this the
[53:43] whole service
[53:47] where are they
[53:49] six months later they're out the door
[53:52] well what'd they get they just got happy
[53:58] I wish some of you might try that it
[54:00] might work
[54:01] but don't leave
[54:04] but brother Ryan says look we find those
[54:06] things happen you know I know we see
[54:08] these stumbles along the road we find
[54:10] scrap heaps of ministers I mean these
[54:12] are true people this is not just the
[54:14] scum of the Earth
[54:15] ministers Christians piled along the
[54:18] road is because they don't go into it
[54:20] right in other words what they got ahead
[54:21] of what the plan
[54:23] all right and that's why I'm here this
[54:25] morning is to try to teach this little
[54:26] church and myself
[54:27] what a humble man there stood a prophet
[54:30] trying to teach the people knowing he
[54:31] already had these virtues because he
[54:33] didn't couldn't have them and not teach
[54:34] them to the people
[54:35] and he said and myself
[54:37] and I believe he believed that too
[54:40] all right statue of perfect man patience
[54:42] with what patience with God
[54:44] let's continue on let's try I won't try
[54:46] to get the godliness cam we should have
[54:48] patience with one another like I'm
[54:50] trying to get this message over at the
[54:51] Tabernacle see that each member of the
[54:53] Tabernacles become this and that's
[54:55] capital th so it's got to be he's
[54:58] pointing at the Statue of perfect man
[54:59] it's hard to do I've tried to have
[55:01] patience this 33 years see how patience
[55:04] women still Bob their hair still just
[55:06] the same wait have to
[55:10] if you ain't got it don't try to build
[55:12] on it down here have patience
[55:15] Matthew 10 verse 22 he shall be you
[55:18] shall be hated of all men but he that
[55:20] endureth to the end patience
[55:24] wins the race
[55:27] tortoise in the hair
[55:29] who always wins
[55:31] the tortoise
[55:33] every book I've read the tortoise always
[55:35] wins
[55:36] it doesn't matter if it come out 12
[55:38] different volumes and in another
[55:40] language
[55:41] the tortoise always wins
[55:43] all right
[55:44] slow and steady wins the race but he
[55:46] then endureth to the end shall be saved
[55:48] and doroth is what to remain abide not
[55:51] flee when first thing happens or first
[55:53] thing doesn't go right and and you know
[55:56] we talk about the um in in Matthew where
[55:58] Jesus talks about the sore of the seed
[56:00] some seed there's all they're just in
[56:03] good ground and it's growing up really
[56:04] good and all of a sudden what the cares
[56:06] of the world chokes them out Sun Shines
[56:08] they have a hard day at work or they
[56:10] have a hard week at work or they're
[56:13] having trouble at home or they're having
[56:14] trouble with their parents or having
[56:16] trouble I'm talking about kids too
[56:18] first thing we do is what
[56:22] we're fight was it fight or flea
[56:25] fight or flight
[56:28] let's fight
[56:30] don't fight who you're trying to let's
[56:32] fight the devil the devil's the one
[56:33] that's doing it not your parents or your
[56:35] mama or your daddy or or your brother or
[56:37] sister or your husband or wife it's the
[56:39] devil that we don't like I like what
[56:41] brother uh we always were at Youth Camp
[56:43] there in Alabama with brother
[56:46] um Homer Longoria well brother Gary was
[56:48] always the one that he'd stand up and
[56:49] he'd tell us on Friday night he said
[56:51] look he said you guys
[56:53] We Trust
[56:55] the devil we don't
[56:58] all right
[56:59] so that's the same way
[57:01] but look remain abide listen sit still
[57:04] look right there on that beam right
[57:06] above right there you can see it and I
[57:08] can't what's it say be still
[57:11] be still
[57:13] and know that I am God
[57:16] and the word ends the end which all
[57:18] things relate the aim of the purpose in
[57:20] other words this plan has an end to it
[57:23] oh yeah it does we don't need Redemption
[57:25] when we get to heaven
[57:28] we need it to get there
[57:31] that's the race that's the Run that's
[57:33] the patience that's the virtue and all
[57:35] the temperance and all that so let's
[57:37] talk about godliness here for a moment
[57:38] for a minute godliness is reverence
[57:40] respect piety towards God godliness for
[57:44] people shall be lovers second Timothy
[57:46] now there's a form of godliness we'll
[57:47] talk about in just a minute men shall be
[57:50] lovers of their own self this is that
[57:51] same group that I was talking about that
[57:53] he was talking over in Corinthians this
[57:55] is basically the same group pretty much
[57:57] the same words
[57:58] lovers of their own selves
[58:06] selfie sticks wow
[58:10] that guy made a fortune off of that
[58:13] stupid selfie stick
[58:16] uh whatever man shall be lovers of their
[58:18] own selves Covetous boasters proud
[58:20] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[58:22] unthankful Unholy without natural
[58:24] affection boy we see that now truce
[58:27] Breakers false accusers incontinent
[58:28] Fierce despisers of those that are good
[58:30] Traders heavy high-minded lovers of
[58:33] Pleasures more than lovers of God
[58:34] having a form of God in a form of
[58:37] godliness
[58:39] everybody with me
[58:41] but denying the power thereof
[58:45] remember power without characters what
[58:48] satanic from such turn away for this
[58:52] sort of they which creep in the houses
[58:53] lead silly women churches
[58:56] Laden with sins lead them away with
[58:58] diver's lust ever learning
[59:01] and never able to come to the knowledge
[59:04] of the truth let's go back
[59:07] read first Timothy again trying to hurry
[59:10] through this and then we'll get to our
[59:11] thought
[59:12] and without controversy great is the
[59:14] mystery of godliness God was manifested
[59:16] in the flesh justified in the spirit
[59:18] saint of angels preached unto the
[59:20] Gentiles believe it on the world
[59:21] received up into Glory look what brother
[59:22] Brown says look
[59:24] so you're moving right on up now we're
[59:26] way on up the line fifthly at godliness
[59:28] oh my godliness to be added what does
[59:30] godliness mean
[59:32] I looked in four or five dictionaries
[59:33] and couldn't find what it meant finally
[59:35] I was down to brother Jeffrey's there we
[59:37] found it in her dictionary godliness
[59:38] means to be like God
[59:42] brother Brown wants to change just to
[59:44] change he's pretty much telling you know
[59:45] he don't he don't elaborate a lot
[59:48] to be like God after you've got but look
[59:50] you got to be like God after
[59:53] you get Faith version all is temperance
[59:56] patience then be like God you can't be
[59:58] like God like you need to be down that
[1:00:01] virtue because that's trying to figure
[1:00:03] out what's going on
[1:00:05] strength wise and then you've got
[1:00:07] knowledge and all those it's exactly
[1:00:09] where it's supposed to be brother
[1:00:10] Branham I can't do that oh yes you can
[1:00:13] let me read you a few scriptures Matthew
[1:00:15] 5 48. what does it say you're God's
[1:00:19] why all the virtue all the things that's
[1:00:22] in God
[1:00:24] is in you
[1:00:26] do we believe that
[1:00:29] Jesus speaking in the Beatitudes be
[1:00:32] therefore p e r f e c t what's that
[1:00:34] perfect even as your father in Heaven is
[1:00:36] perfect you get way up here now before
[1:00:38] you're asked to do that
[1:00:40] all these things has to be added first
[1:00:42] and then when you get up here he's asked
[1:00:45] you now to be perfect godliness Sons and
[1:00:48] Daughters of God that's right how many
[1:00:50] things I could say along that line then
[1:00:52] he goes to Ephesians 4 and tells us how
[1:00:54] to get perfect
[1:00:55] here's part of the plan I kind of took
[1:00:57] it out of that it was in this morning
[1:00:58] but you know what Ephesians 4 is he gave
[1:01:01] some Apostles prophets pastors teachers
[1:01:03] and evangelists for the what for the
[1:01:06] perfecting of the Saints for the
[1:01:08] edifying of the body till we all come
[1:01:11] what
[1:01:12] to the unity of the faith
[1:01:16] invisible Union brother Brown says a man
[1:01:18] that's born of God a Son of God has to
[1:01:21] have the nature of God so this is a have
[1:01:24] to this is required curriculum
[1:01:27] all right to graduate you got to have
[1:01:30] this
[1:01:32] and we'll get into that maybe the next
[1:01:34] service I want to break down and you say
[1:01:36] well why are they so important without
[1:01:38] these number one you can't come to
[1:01:40] adoption
[1:01:42] all right without these you can't come
[1:01:44] to adoption I'm sorry
[1:01:46] okay
[1:01:47] and then you see up there where it says
[1:01:48] holy spirit that brings an anointing
[1:01:51] that's a little bit different than the
[1:01:53] one you got at the new birth
[1:01:55] stronger you might say
[1:01:56] all right God can use you better he
[1:01:59] can't use you when you're a babbling
[1:02:00] baby
[1:02:03] no you're just trying to figure out how
[1:02:05] to walk you're trying to figure out how
[1:02:06] to talk
[1:02:08] now we've grown up supposed to
[1:02:13] he has to be like God
[1:02:15] he honors God he's part of the word of
[1:02:18] God
[1:02:19] and in this last days of this bride
[1:02:22] taking form just exactly look just
[1:02:25] exactly the same power that he was at
[1:02:28] the beginning
[1:02:30] do you believe that
[1:02:34] have we come to the faith that was once
[1:02:37] delivered to the Saints 2 000 years ago
[1:02:40] they had these virtues working in their
[1:02:43] life
[1:02:44] that little tug a little nod
[1:02:47] has come up through these organizations
[1:02:48] before so forth and come out for the
[1:02:50] bride he can't be nothing else
[1:02:54] but that first Timothy 6 3 said If any
[1:02:56] man Teach otherwise and consent not to
[1:02:59] hold some words even the words of our
[1:03:00] Lord Jesus and to the doctrine there is
[1:03:04] a doctrine of godliness
[1:03:08] listen folks without the message of the
[1:03:10] hour
[1:03:12] can't have it
[1:03:18] you tell me how they're going to teach
[1:03:20] us godliness when they believe in three
[1:03:23] and once saved always saved and it's all
[1:03:25] right to do this and start to do that
[1:03:27] you ain't perfect how many of you have
[1:03:29] witnessed to people
[1:03:31] and you start telling them about your
[1:03:33] hair and your dress and you start
[1:03:34] telling them how I don't smoke anymore I
[1:03:36] don't curse anymore they said well you
[1:03:38] ain't perfect I ain't perfect so they
[1:03:40] just keep going on smoking their
[1:03:41] cigarettes thinking that they're born
[1:03:42] again
[1:03:45] all right everybody with me so there's a
[1:03:47] Doctrine according to Godliness and it
[1:03:49] was a doctrine that the prophet of God
[1:03:50] brought us
[1:03:52] he is proud knowing nothing but doting
[1:03:54] about questions and strife of words
[1:03:56] thereof whereof come it's Envy Strife
[1:03:58] railing evil surmising here's these same
[1:04:00] people again perverse disputing of men
[1:04:03] of corrupt minds and the destitute of
[1:04:05] the truth
[1:04:07] supposing that gain is godliness
[1:04:10] all prosperity
[1:04:14] man
[1:04:15] if you can get an Escalade
[1:04:18] you got the Holy Ghost
[1:04:21] if you get the Escalade with all the
[1:04:24] package
[1:04:27] you adopted
[1:04:30] yeah no you just in a lot of debt
[1:04:34] and it don't drive no different than a
[1:04:36] regular car does
[1:04:37] until you maybe take it to the parts
[1:04:39] store and have to buy parts for it
[1:04:41] anybody win the same man okay some of
[1:04:44] y'all that are asleep
[1:04:45] look look from such withdraw yourself
[1:04:50] withdraw yourself from that
[1:04:53] but godliness
[1:04:55] will contentment
[1:04:58] wow it's great game
[1:05:01] for we brought nothing into this world
[1:05:03] and it's certain Zuckerberg is not going
[1:05:06] to carry anything out and if he ain't
[1:05:07] born again you know where he's going
[1:05:10] if you ain't got the new birth guess
[1:05:12] where you're going okay
[1:05:15] for we brought nothing in a certain we
[1:05:17] carry nothing out that word contentment
[1:05:20] have you ever seen a baby I saw I got a
[1:05:22] a customer that she just had a newborn
[1:05:24] and uh she's got two other kids and a
[1:05:27] man them two kids are just I mean
[1:05:29] they're a riot
[1:05:30] they come out to the mailbox and they're
[1:05:32] just you know I mean they're 90 miles an
[1:05:33] hour
[1:05:35] but she just had a new baby and she's
[1:05:37] got one of them things that the baby you
[1:05:38] know stays right here you put them down
[1:05:40] in the bag kind of like a kangaroo sack
[1:05:42] you know what she's talking to me and
[1:05:44] that baby you know every time she moves
[1:05:45] that baby's like yeah
[1:05:48] I said that baby okay she said oh he
[1:05:50] just ate
[1:05:52] he's content
[1:05:54] because he's got his mama well that to
[1:05:56] me listen we can be that in God
[1:05:58] can you have that much contentment with
[1:06:01] your personal experience with the Lord
[1:06:03] that you can lay yourself on his chest
[1:06:06] and say feed me
[1:06:08] hold me when I need hold it come on
[1:06:10] somebody
[1:06:11] feed me give me something you are my
[1:06:14] sustainer at this time I'm a baby I need

[1:06:22] give me the Gerbers but give me some of
[1:06:24] that good milk
[1:06:26] hey man it's okay to drink milk it's all
[1:06:28] right don't get all upset we do eat meat
[1:06:30] but that kid if you fed that
[1:06:32] three-month-old baby meat what would
[1:06:34] happen choke it to death and kill it
[1:06:37] amen same thing with the gospel you
[1:06:39] don't shove meat down a baby's throat
[1:06:43] but now when you get older
[1:06:46] Texas Roadhouse here we come
[1:06:49] hmm
[1:06:51] Longhorn
[1:06:52] well I don't like Longhorns
[1:06:55] I'm content at Texas Roadhouse y'all
[1:06:58] know where I'm not contending at but can
[1:07:01] tell that it's sufficiency a perfect
[1:07:04] condition of life you say how can I be
[1:07:06] perfect
[1:07:07] listen who causes most of our problems
[1:07:11] would you take your hand and do this
[1:07:13] right here and do this right here
[1:07:17] don't point at me point at yourself
[1:07:21] some of y'all get by with that
[1:07:24] but I'm my worst enemy I don't know
[1:07:26] about y'all
[1:07:31] but a perfect condition of life in which
[1:07:34] no Aid or support is needed
[1:07:38] we were just talking about needing
[1:07:39] support and needing
[1:07:41] now he's talking about you can get to a
[1:07:43] place to where you can be content
[1:07:47] godliness with contentment is great gain
[1:07:51] a perfect condition of life in which no
[1:07:53] Aid or support is needed sufficiency of
[1:07:56] the necessities of life a mind
[1:07:59] contented with this lot
[1:08:05] can we do that
[1:08:06] what did John tell those soldiers I told
[1:08:08] you about last Sunday what John tell
[1:08:10] those soldiers he said be content with
[1:08:12] your wages don't be sitting over
[1:08:13] squabbling and arguing about stuff I
[1:08:16] hear some of y'all you you'll quit a job
[1:08:18] for ten dollars a week
[1:08:21] difference in pay
[1:08:23] you better weigh the cost the whole cost
[1:08:25] life lesson 375. second Timothy 3 1.
[1:08:30] there's no also that in the last days
[1:08:32] perilous time shall come they're here
[1:08:35] the hair we have a
[1:08:38] Rock for men shall be lovers of their
[1:08:40] own self now this is them same people
[1:08:42] that we talked about here a few minutes
[1:08:44] ago
[1:08:46] let's go on down here because I want to
[1:08:47] read them again having a form of
[1:08:49] godliness so here's the form let's look
[1:08:51] at this real quick because you know what
[1:08:53] I was thinking about yesterday Satan has
[1:08:55] his own perfect statue of a perfect man
[1:09:01] come on there's twins in every Revival
[1:09:05] if if you've got if if God's got a place
[1:09:08] for us to come to Satan's working on his
[1:09:10] too
[1:09:12] does he not want Power
[1:09:15] does he not want knowledge
[1:09:17] he's part he is the knowledge of the
[1:09:20] triple of Good and Evil
[1:09:23] yeah he's got a temper he just don't
[1:09:24] want to get rid of it
[1:09:27] now watch let's see this people though
[1:09:28] that have a form of godliness
[1:09:31] brother Brown said anointing once a ten
[1:09:33] times in other words if he wanted to
[1:09:35] break it down so we would be more or
[1:09:37] less understand it better he would say
[1:09:39] in the last days there shall rise false
[1:09:42] anointed ones he's talking about false
[1:09:43] Christ now that seems almost impossible
[1:09:46] see the terms of anointed but notice the
[1:09:49] very next words and false prophets
[1:09:53] p-r-o-p-h-e-t-s plural now anointed one
[1:09:56] is one with a message
[1:10:00] and the only way the message can be
[1:10:02] brought out is by one that's anointed
[1:10:06] makes sense
[1:10:08] and that would be a prophet anointed
[1:10:11] now watch him as he carries on down he's
[1:10:13] in anointed ones
[1:10:15] there shall arise false anointed
[1:10:18] teachers
[1:10:21] a form
[1:10:23] of godliness
[1:10:24] able to preach this message maybe 20 30
[1:10:26] years and then all of a sudden say it's
[1:10:28] worthless
[1:10:30] a prophet teaches what his message is
[1:10:35] let me read that one more time a prophet
[1:10:37] teaches what his message is
[1:10:41] anointed teachers but anointing people
[1:10:44] with false teaching
[1:10:47] anointed ones Christ poor prophets
[1:10:49] plural and if there is such a thing as a
[1:10:52] Christ singular then these would have to
[1:10:54] be anointed ones that their prophecy of
[1:10:58] what they were teaching would be the
[1:11:01] difference
[1:11:04] because they are anointed ones
[1:11:06] they're anointed and I'm fixing to read
[1:11:08] you one that I know you've read it
[1:11:11] before and you've heard it before that
[1:11:13] anointing is the true Holy Ghost
[1:11:17] the same Holy Ghost you got in your soul
[1:11:20] they get it on their spirit
[1:11:23] now someone might say to me do you
[1:11:26] believe
[1:11:32] you believe sir
[1:11:33] the genuine holy spirit of God upon a
[1:11:36] person
[1:11:37] and yet they're false
[1:11:40] that's why it flips some people's lid
[1:11:42] when when you quote them that quote
[1:11:44] where brother Brown said you can have
[1:11:45] the baptism of the Holy Ghost every day
[1:11:47] of your life
[1:11:49] and die and go to hell
[1:11:52] but you can't have the new birth
[1:11:55] one day of your life
[1:11:57] and go to hell
[1:11:58] you can be anointed by the true baptism
[1:12:01] of the Holy Ghost on your spirit Realm
[1:12:05] and your soul be as black as Judas is
[1:12:08] carrying
[1:12:10] anoint one's a ten times let's continue
[1:12:12] on let's get this real quick but
[1:12:13] remember
[1:12:14] that Pentecostal Church in the last days
[1:12:16] was a laodicea and Christ was turned out
[1:12:19] the colonel the wheat itself when he
[1:12:22] tried remember when he tried to manifest
[1:12:24] himself in the church now the reason I'm
[1:12:25] bringing this is the parallel because
[1:12:27] that's what we're doing now
[1:12:28] we're manifesting what's inside of us
[1:12:31] and listen let me tell you something you
[1:12:33] may fool somebody
[1:12:35] for years
[1:12:36] but you hang around this message long
[1:12:38] enough
[1:12:39] you're gonna pop up like a what they
[1:12:41] call it whack-a-mole things you're gonna
[1:12:43] pop up like this
[1:12:44] you got to yeah you're going to manifest
[1:12:47] what's inside of you that's why I said
[1:12:48] let it out either good or bad
[1:12:51] let it out because it's going to show
[1:12:53] and it's going to embarrass a lot of
[1:12:54] people
[1:13:00] when he tried to manifest himself in the
[1:13:02] church
[1:13:03] he was took out
[1:13:08] brother Dale
[1:13:10] brother Bob
[1:13:12] for the Aaron
[1:13:14] for Louise myself
[1:13:16] there's places in this message we can't
[1:13:18] go preach
[1:13:20] and they all said
[1:13:22] thank you
[1:13:24] oh wait a minute same message
[1:13:27] really
[1:13:31] there's places won't let us in
[1:13:33] because of their Doctrine
[1:13:37] hmm
[1:13:38] anointed
[1:13:41] it was still a church claimed to be
[1:13:45] and an anointed Church
[1:13:48] but here is the word Christ himself
[1:13:51] what we're trying to get to the son of
[1:13:53] man
[1:13:59] that's God in human flesh Jesus was not
[1:14:02] deceived one day on the face of this
[1:14:04] Earth he wasn't deceived one second
[1:14:08] he knew who Judas was he knew who confis
[1:14:10] was he knew who the ones that were
[1:14:12] perverting the word of God that's why he
[1:14:14] would he'd look into the heart was
[1:14:16] talking to somebody a few minutes ago
[1:14:17] God God listen God sees your heart yes
[1:14:22] not your emotion he fast through all
[1:14:25] that to get to your heart and he knows
[1:14:28] what you want God knows in my heart if I
[1:14:31] die and go to hell I want you to make it
[1:14:34] and I want to try to help you get in the
[1:14:36] right path
[1:14:37] that's the way we all ought to be
[1:14:40] I'm not here to help myself
[1:14:43] I'm here to help you
[1:14:46] I get help seeing you get help
[1:14:50] but here's the word of God Christ
[1:14:51] himself that's the anointing word which
[1:14:53] shall come for the rest of his body the
[1:14:56] bride so he's not talking about
[1:14:58] anointing ones now he's talking about me
[1:15:00] and you
[1:15:01] the anointed of the same water that
[1:15:04] watered the wheat as we talked about
[1:15:06] also Waters to tears
[1:15:10] I wish that wasn't true because I have a
[1:15:12] garden most of my weeds look really good
[1:15:14] and you can't eat them
[1:15:18] but they get the same fertilizer and
[1:15:20] they get the same water that I give my
[1:15:22] corn and my potatoes and my beans
[1:15:28] Adam
[1:15:30] sold us out
[1:15:33] Jesus God said thorns and thistles
[1:15:38] but we're heading back to where I want a
[1:15:40] Garden of Eden again
[1:15:43] look only the elected are predestinated
[1:15:46] now let's go back to what we were
[1:15:47] talking about way back we'll be able to
[1:15:51] detect the difference between them so
[1:15:55] you got to have that kind of godliness
[1:15:57] to tell what the opposite is
[1:16:03] are you going to be deceived
[1:16:07] well don't get quiet you will
[1:16:10] but you don't have to you have choice
[1:16:14] we'll be able to detect the difference
[1:16:16] between them now Ephesians 5 1 tells you
[1:16:19] so and about how it was notice the
[1:16:23] anointed ones only the word will
[1:16:25] separate them not an emotion
[1:16:28] then Christ speaking tongues and preach
[1:16:30] like a house on fire on a windy day
[1:16:33] but if they ain't got the Holy Ghost in
[1:16:35] their soul they're lost and you know
[1:16:37] what's happening to people like the
[1:16:38] humans and all these people that are
[1:16:40] that are turning against the messages
[1:16:41] preached for 30 or 40 years they didn't
[1:16:44] have it to start with
[1:16:48] not saying they can't get it not saying
[1:16:51] that they might be deceived but if they
[1:16:53] continue on like they are lambastian the
[1:16:55] church and lambastian the Bride of Jesus
[1:16:57] Christ they didn't get the New Birth
[1:16:59] when they thought they did
[1:17:01] because word won't fight word bride
[1:17:03] won't fight bride bride
[1:17:06] sorry about that didn't need the main
[1:17:08] name names but you know what they name
[1:17:09] ours so
[1:17:12] look only the word will separate them
[1:17:15] not the signs
[1:17:17] you watch these people left a message
[1:17:20] they're going to have more signs and
[1:17:21] wonders than we do
[1:17:25] because they're anointed
[1:17:26] they're anointed they're the anointed
[1:17:29] with the statement or anywhere we're
[1:17:30] Anointed with
[1:17:31] the difference is down inside that typo
[1:17:35] says there ain't nothing but the truth
[1:17:37] or that's not the truth
[1:17:42] sure they all prophesied
[1:17:45] they all done this that and the other
[1:17:47] sure just the same Jesus said they'd do
[1:17:49] the same thing but the word is what
[1:17:52] separates them notice not the signs
[1:17:55] science follow believers they don't go
[1:17:57] in front they follow them
[1:18:00] I know it's at night 1965. why you say
[1:18:02] these are good people what makes them
[1:18:04] because one thing their top post is on a
[1:18:07] church
[1:18:08] and in here you remember last Sunday a
[1:18:10] week ago how many was hearing heard the
[1:18:11] sermon on anointed ones he refers back
[1:18:13] to that
[1:18:14] see they are anointed their Spirits are
[1:18:17] anointed in this second realm
[1:18:21] he didn't say the bot the inside he said
[1:18:23] the second realm which is what we're
[1:18:25] talking about remember reason conscious
[1:18:26] effects and Imagination nobody with me
[1:18:28] all right wake up
[1:18:34] revealed in his own word I'm sorry today
[1:18:36] so confused about the evidence of the
[1:18:39] Holy Ghost still today
[1:18:42] and so forth Satan can impersonate any
[1:18:45] kind of gift that God's Got
[1:18:48] but he cannot bring the word word by
[1:18:51] word
[1:18:52] he's going to come off somewhere
[1:18:55] you've got to be able to discern when he
[1:18:59] does come off
[1:19:01] but he cannot bring that word word by
[1:19:03] word that's where he failed in the
[1:19:05] Garden of Eden
[1:19:06] that's where he's always failed
[1:19:09] that's where them the tape on false
[1:19:12] anointed ones are anointed ones they can
[1:19:14] be Anointed with the spirit speak in
[1:19:16] tongues dance shout preach the gospel
[1:19:18] still be a devil
[1:19:22] you think about that I want you to take
[1:19:24] that home I want you to mull around in
[1:19:26] your head
[1:19:27] God am I deceived
[1:19:29] is this it
[1:19:30] is this the message of the hour
[1:19:34] you better find out whether it is or not
[1:19:35] because you know what the devil has just
[1:19:38] heard what I said
[1:19:40] and he's going to be on all of us that's
[1:19:42] okay
[1:19:44] that's his job
[1:19:48] Psalms 4 verse two you know what our job
[1:19:49] is
[1:19:51] resist the devil and he'll flee from you
[1:19:53] don't have to make up no potion you
[1:19:55] don't have to go do this that and the
[1:19:56] other state 25 Hail Marys resist him
[1:20:01] our worst problem is we don't
[1:20:06] oh I'm the only one sorry
[1:20:09] oh you sons of men how long will you
[1:20:11] turn my glory into shame well what's
[1:20:13] this
[1:20:14] how long will you love vanity and seek
[1:20:17] after leasing that word Lisa means
[1:20:19] something totally different than what we
[1:20:20] think it is and I'm gonna go get into it
[1:20:22] but know that the Lord has set apart him
[1:20:26] that is Godly for himself
[1:20:30] separated
[1:20:33] God separated us for him
[1:20:37] the Lord will hear when I call unto him
[1:20:39] stand in awe and sin not commune with
[1:20:42] your own Hearts upon your bed and be
[1:20:43] still say law offer the sacrifices of
[1:20:46] righteousness and put your trust
[1:20:48] in the Lord Psalms 32 5. I acknowledge
[1:20:51] my sin unto thee of my iniquity have I
[1:20:54] not hid I said I will confess my
[1:20:56] transgressions unto the Lord and thou
[1:20:59] forgavest the iniquity of my sin say law
[1:21:02] this is under bulls and goats
[1:21:05] for this very for this shall everyone
[1:21:08] that is Godly pray unto thee in a time
[1:21:11] when thou mayest be found
[1:21:16] surely in the floods of Great Waters
[1:21:18] they shall not come nigh
[1:21:21] unto him
[1:21:22] Thou Art my Hiding Place
[1:21:26] Thou shalt
[1:21:28] from trouble
[1:21:30] Thou shalt Compass me about with songs
[1:21:34] of Deliverance
[1:21:36] let me read that one more time they are
[1:21:38] my Hiding Place
[1:21:39] Thou shalt preserve me from trouble he's
[1:21:42] given you a promise
[1:21:45] if you'll just take hold of it Thou
[1:21:47] shalt come past me about with songs
[1:21:50] of Deliverance
[1:21:52] let's look at the word Godly now that's
[1:21:54] a it's a little bit different than
[1:21:56] godliness because what it's going to do
[1:21:57] it's going to bring it a little more
[1:21:58] intimate it's going to say if you live
[1:22:00] Godly now godliness is a word all right
[1:22:03] but Godly is something you do
[1:22:06] all right all who live Godly in Christ
[1:22:08] shall suffer persecution so that's kind
[1:22:09] of brain now watch the word Godly in the
[1:22:12] Greek means Theos is that right
[1:22:15] we have a Greek girl sitting in the back
[1:22:17] my sweet little daughter-in-law
[1:22:19] she corrects me when I don't say the
[1:22:21] Greek words right
[1:22:23] because she's a Greek
[1:22:25] Phil's
[1:22:27] well see that's God
[1:22:29] feels
[1:22:31] whatever can and in any respect be
[1:22:33] likened unto God
[1:22:35] or resembly man anyway
[1:22:40] a stature
[1:22:42] of a perfect man
[1:22:43] that's the image of God
[1:22:46] right
[1:22:48] and by these virtues
[1:22:50] and by being Godly
[1:22:53] we should resemble him
[1:22:56] no I resemble my Mom and Daddy yeah but
[1:22:58] you don't have to act like them
[1:23:02] preach brother I believe it will
[1:23:03] whatever candid respect be like unto God
[1:23:06] or resemble him in any way God's
[1:23:08] representative look God's representative
[1:23:12] he's not ashamed to call us Brethren the
[1:23:14] Bible says he's not ashamed to put you
[1:23:16] on display he will put this Bride on
[1:23:19] display whether you like it or not
[1:23:22] somebody will stand and say I've had
[1:23:25] enough yes
[1:23:28] foreign
[1:23:29] resemble him
[1:23:31] brother Brown said I won't say what in
[1:23:35] other words pull yourself so far away
[1:23:36] from the devil he don't know what to do
[1:23:38] with you now listen there's a lot of
[1:23:40] times he knows what to do with us and
[1:23:42] that's our problem
[1:23:44] but what about a time when you confuse
[1:23:47] that rascal
[1:23:49] you confuse the devil
[1:23:51] okay how are you going to do it refuse
[1:23:53] him
[1:23:57] say 20 Hail Marys and Beads and no
[1:23:59] refusing
[1:24:03] so this is what we're doing we're to be
[1:24:05] Godly so we're going to read scripture
[1:24:07] now to be Godly is to resemble God
[1:24:10] 's representative or vice Regent
[1:24:15] of magistrates and judges second
[1:24:17] Corinthians 7 9 says now Rejoice we'll
[1:24:19] close here in just a second Shake
[1:24:21] Yourself just for a minute I know it's
[1:24:23] hot I know we've already ate I know
[1:24:26] to
[1:24:27] have trouble staying awake
[1:24:30] you wouldn't have trouble staying awake
[1:24:31] if your favorite football team was on TV
[1:24:34] oh I'm sorry
[1:24:39] now rejoice
[1:24:41] not that you were mates were made sorry
[1:24:43] but you sorrowed
[1:24:46] to repentance
[1:24:49] for you were made sorry
[1:24:51] after a Godly manner
[1:24:54] that you might receive damage by us in
[1:24:56] nothing now watch it now Paul what are
[1:24:59] you trying to get watch for Godly sorrow
[1:25:02] worketh repentance to Salvation not to
[1:25:05] be repented of
[1:25:07] all right
[1:25:09] but the sorrow of the world
[1:25:11] worketh death
[1:25:13] for behold this self-same thing that you
[1:25:16] sorrowed after a Godly sort
[1:25:20] what carefulness it wrought in you yea
[1:25:23] what clearing of yourself
[1:25:26] what ending Nation yay what fear
[1:25:31] what vehement Behemoth desire
[1:25:34] what zeal
[1:25:36] yeah what Revenge
[1:25:39] and all things you have approved
[1:25:41] yourself to be clear
[1:25:44] in this matter you know what he's saying
[1:25:45] let me just give you a real short
[1:25:47] version some of those Corinthians have
[1:25:50] come to a little bit of perfection
[1:25:52] and he's seeing that in them
[1:25:55] and he's telling them right here and all
[1:25:57] things you have approved yourself to be
[1:25:59] clear
[1:26:00] in this matter
[1:26:02] second Timothy 3 11 persecutions
[1:26:04] afflictions which came unto me in
[1:26:06] Antioch Iconium lystra what persecutions
[1:26:09] I endured but out of them all the Lord
[1:26:11] delivered me yay and all that will live
[1:26:14] Godly in Christ shall sit on a bed of
[1:26:19] ease
[1:26:21] shall sit with chicken feathers
[1:26:25] under their rear end
[1:26:31] and oh I'm sorry and everything's going
[1:26:32] to go right
[1:26:35] all that will live Godly in Christ
[1:26:38] shall suffer persecution
[1:26:41] but evil men and seducers show wax worse
[1:26:44] and worse deceiving and being deceived
[1:26:49] second Peter 2 6 and turn in the cities
[1:26:51] of Sodom and Gomorrah into Ash
[1:26:53] containing condemning them with an
[1:26:55] overthrow making them an example unto
[1:26:57] those that after that after should live
[1:27:00] ungodly and delivered just lot vexed
[1:27:04] with a filthy conversation of the wicked
[1:27:06] for that righteous man dwelling among
[1:27:08] them and seeing and hearing begs his
[1:27:09] righteous soul from day to day with her
[1:27:12] unlawful Deeds the Lord knoweth how to
[1:27:14] deliver The Godly out of Temptation
[1:27:18] not to keep from getting into temptation
[1:27:20] but when you get into temptation he's
[1:27:23] got a way to get you out of it
[1:27:26] that's what it's saying right here and
[1:27:28] to reserve the unjust until the day of
[1:27:30] judgment to be punished Psalms 1 1
[1:27:33] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[1:27:36] the council of the ungodly
[1:27:39] nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor
[1:27:41] sitteth in the seed of this cornful
[1:27:43] but his Delight is in the law of the
[1:27:46] Lord
[1:27:46] and in his law does he meditate
[1:27:49] day and night and he should be like a
[1:27:52] tree
[1:27:53] planted by the rivers of water that
[1:27:55] bringeth forth his fruit
[1:27:58] bringeth forth these virtues
[1:28:02] in due season
[1:28:04] his Leaf also shall not wither
[1:28:07] and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
[1:28:11] the ungodly are not so
[1:28:15] but I like the chaff which to win
[1:28:17] driveeth away
[1:28:19] therefore the ungodly shall not stand in
[1:28:22] the Judgment you say whoa now wait a
[1:28:23] minute wow
[1:28:27] they're already judged
[1:28:30] by being ungodly you're already judged
[1:28:33] but they have to go to the watch on
[1:28:34] judgment right so that's not saying that
[1:28:37] they're not going to be judged anybody
[1:28:39] with me you know what that means you're
[1:28:41] Bible readers look nor sinners in the
[1:28:43] congregation of the righteous
[1:28:45] for the Lord knoweth the way of the
[1:28:47] righteous but the way of the ungodly
[1:28:50] Shall Perish
[1:28:52] ungodly means Wicked criminal guilty one
[1:28:55] one guilty of crime Wicked hostile to
[1:28:58] God Wicked guilty of sin against God or
[1:29:02] man that's not a good group to be around
[1:29:04] Romans 5 5 says in Hope maketh not
[1:29:07] ashamed because the love of God is shed
[1:29:09] abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost
[1:29:11] which is given unto us for when we were
[1:29:13] yet without strength
[1:29:15] in due time Christ died for the ungodly
[1:29:19] so listen
[1:29:21] he died for you amen
[1:29:23] because at one time you was in that
[1:29:25] ungodly group
[1:29:27] oh no I always what no
[1:29:30] you were dead
[1:29:32] you're a sinner on your way to hell
[1:29:35] brother Branham said he was a sinner on
[1:29:37] his way to hell
[1:29:39] amen
[1:29:41] no I'm good no not one
[1:29:43] only one perfect man that was Jesus
[1:29:45] Christ
[1:29:46] everybody else is lost and without God
[1:29:49] you didn't come to this world with a
[1:29:52] silver
[1:29:57] tape player in your mouth
[1:29:59] I didn't want to say that but it did
[1:30:01] where you just pop it in and I believe
[1:30:04] the message I know I know where that
[1:30:05] quote is I know what's going on out of
[1:30:07] this
[1:30:08] no you were dead
[1:30:10] the Bible said you were dead and
[1:30:11] trespassing sins not excluding anyone
[1:30:15] because see I like to believe it that
[1:30:17] way therefore I know that my Redemption
[1:30:19] comes from me being lost totally lost
[1:30:22] dead on my way to hell but God
[1:30:26] who is rich in Mercy
[1:30:29] he looked down and saw me that one day
[1:30:32] he would call and I would answer
[1:30:36] I'd forget that former life Paul said
[1:30:38] the life I now live
[1:30:40] I live by the faith of the Son of God he
[1:30:43] must have lived a different life
[1:30:46] why was he persecuting Christians if he
[1:30:48] had eternal life in his soul I don't
[1:30:49] understand that
[1:30:50] when we were yet without Strength In Due
[1:30:53] Time Christ died for the ungodly for
[1:30:55] scarcely for a righteous man will one
[1:30:57] die
[1:30:59] remember that's why he told the
[1:31:01] Pharisees they said why aren't you
[1:31:02] hanging around Sinners and prostitutes
[1:31:03] and people that are sick
[1:31:06] he said well people don't need a
[1:31:08] physician
[1:31:09] he said sick people need a physician
[1:31:11] that's why I come
[1:31:15] yeah pre-adventure for a good man some
[1:31:17] would even Dare To Die
[1:31:19] but God commandeth his love toward us in
[1:31:21] that while we were yet
[1:31:24] sinners
[1:31:27] Christ died for us
[1:31:29] much more than being now justified by
[1:31:32] his blood we shall be saved from wrath
[1:31:36] through him
[1:31:38] for if when we were enemies oh I never
[1:31:41] was an enemy of God
[1:31:43] when you was born from your mama you was
[1:31:45] an enemy from God
[1:31:48] let's just get it hey level the playing
[1:31:50] field
[1:31:52] for if when you were enemies yet when we
[1:31:56] were enemies we were reconciled to God
[1:31:59] by the death of his son much more
[1:32:03] much more
[1:32:05] being reconciled
[1:32:08] we shall be saved by his life not mine
[1:32:14] anybody with me
[1:32:15] godliness
[1:32:17] to be like God Godly is you're acting
[1:32:20] like him
[1:32:22] all that live Godly in Christ
[1:32:25] shall suffer
[1:32:27] persecution
[1:32:30] but all listen folks
[1:32:32] everybody wants in this world everybody
[1:32:34] wants their one moment of Fame
[1:32:39] right everybody wants that one moment
[1:32:41] that the whole world
[1:32:43] just stops
[1:32:45] because I'm the best looking guy
[1:32:48] I got the biggest muscles
[1:32:51] I got the tightest dress I'm talking
[1:32:53] about men
[1:33:05] they're gonna have to quit doing gender
[1:33:06] reveal if they can't do that no more you
[1:33:08] got wait till the kid gets five or six
[1:33:10] to decide what he is a boy or girl or it
[1:33:12] is a boy or girl
[1:33:14] see how stupid this is
[1:33:16] see how dumb see how Satan has just
[1:33:19] barely just put a little bit in it all
[1:33:21] down through time
[1:33:23] and then all of a sudden here we are
[1:33:25] we've got this genetics and we've got
[1:33:28] this and we know that this person uh
[1:33:31] whatever but anyway
[1:33:33] all that live Godly in Christ will
[1:33:36] suffer persecution
[1:33:39] you can have your one moment of Fame
[1:33:41] everybody likes to be important that's
[1:33:43] what it's telling the brothers and
[1:33:44] sisters it's brother Brown said the
[1:33:46] greatest thing what
[1:33:48] is to have your name called
[1:33:54] so that's why I like to call names of
[1:33:55] people when they come to church here
[1:33:57] that we don't know I like to call their
[1:33:59] names because they're important
[1:34:00] and it's not just doing it for show I'm
[1:34:02] doing it because God's brother two
[1:34:04] brother Brown said
[1:34:05] call their name
[1:34:07] that's what they like to hear
[1:34:10] oh no you know you get all these people
[1:34:12] that are
[1:34:13] all oh no I don't liar
[1:34:21] liar remember they told Brother Brown
[1:34:23] said oh no brother Brown you know don't
[1:34:25] brag on me he said he said no he said I
[1:34:28] like to be bragged on all right so let's
[1:34:31] just get rid of all that junk and you do
[1:34:33] like your little moment of somebody
[1:34:35] acknowledging that you're in the
[1:34:36] congregation or that you're a pastor or
[1:34:39] that's your summer got some title and um
[1:34:43] and I like to do that
[1:34:45] because God's gonna call you he's called
[1:34:47] your name already
[1:34:49] and if you responded to that name that's
[1:34:51] all you need to worry about
[1:34:53] if you responded when he called your
[1:34:55] name
[1:34:56] that's the only thing you need to worry
[1:34:57] about
[1:34:58] but the world is looking for their one
[1:35:00] moment of Fame
[1:35:02] they'll get it
[1:35:04] just for about that much
[1:35:07] then they're going hell
[1:35:13] but you and I
[1:35:14] we've slid down into this Earth

[1:39:44] to come
[1:39:45] we know that word means Philadelphia the
[1:39:47] word Philadelphia means brotherly love
[1:39:49] love of the Brethren look love of
[1:39:52] brothers are sisters Brotherly Love in
[1:39:54] the New Testament the love which
[1:39:56] Christians cherish for each other
[1:40:00] as brethren
[1:40:04] also means
[1:40:06] there's Philadelphia in the Greek
[1:40:10] love Ash brethren
[1:40:12] loving brother or sister in a broader
[1:40:15] sense
[1:40:16] loving one like a brother
[1:40:19] loving ones fellow countrymen of an
[1:40:22] Israelite of a Christian loving
[1:40:25] a Christian
[1:40:27] here's what the prophet said about this
[1:40:28] after you've done come from here to here
[1:40:30] to here to here to here I believe he's
[1:40:32] pointing up the statue of perfect man
[1:40:33] now you're coming into the full stature
[1:40:35] now of a Son of God but you've got to
[1:40:38] have this plus all this and you can't
[1:40:40] even start unless you get this
[1:40:45] all right now remember the black bird
[1:40:47] with the peacock feathers don't forget
[1:40:48] him see don't try to add it until you're
[1:40:51] actually born again
[1:40:54] because see it won't work and you can't
[1:40:56] make it work
[1:40:58] it'll come to this or this hair it'll
[1:41:01] come to this or this here it'll crumble
[1:41:03] somewhere but when you get down here
[1:41:07] a genuine born-again Dove he's talking
[1:41:09] about right down there in faith not up
[1:41:11] there
[1:41:12] down here

[1:41:18] everybody with me
[1:41:20] it's a special anointing this is the new
[1:41:23] birth
[1:41:24] then all that is add to all right real
[1:41:27] quick
[1:41:28] but when you get down here a genuine
[1:41:31] born-again Dove then you don't add
[1:41:33] nothing
[1:41:34] it adds to you see comes on up all right
[1:41:37] come into Perfection now all right then
[1:41:39] six little six Lee let's add the Bible
[1:41:42] said add Brotherly Love or brotherly
[1:41:44] kindness now that's a good one right
[1:41:46] here the sixth seven all right adding
[1:41:49] brotherly kindness all right when we get
[1:41:52] to that brotherly kindness put yourself
[1:41:55] in his place
[1:41:57] on the matter
[1:42:00] now you're saying my brother sinned
[1:42:01] against me Peter said shall I forgive
[1:42:03] him he said seven times a day
[1:42:06] Jesus said no
[1:42:07] 70 times 7. which for those of us that
[1:42:11] that graduated from Banks County that's
[1:42:14] 490.
[1:42:17] 490. kind of interesting that it took
[1:42:20] for taking 490 years for Israel to be
[1:42:22] restored that kind of interesting 70
[1:42:25] times 7. brotherly kindness now you see
[1:42:28] if a brother is All Out Of Tune don't be
[1:42:31] impatient with him
[1:42:32] see no see be kind to him go anyway
[1:42:36] somebody said not long ago said how can
[1:42:38] you believe these things the way you do
[1:42:39] it still go to the Assembly of God
[1:42:41] Oneness all the rest then put see
[1:42:44] brotherly kindness
[1:42:46] what was what was his son said brother
[1:42:48] Billy Paul said the greatest thing he
[1:42:50] about now everything he saw about his
[1:42:52] dad
[1:42:53] he was with him since he was a kid he
[1:42:55] saw healings he saw eyeballs being made
[1:42:57] feet be straightened out the word of God
[1:42:59] being preached and the manifestation of
[1:43:02] the of the you know the might not
[1:43:04] reading the minds but
[1:43:05] the thoughts and intents of the heart he
[1:43:08] said the greatest thing about my dad was
[1:43:10] he said he said I never knew who dad's
[1:43:12] enemies or his friends were
[1:43:14] he said he treated them all the same
[1:43:17] I ain't there yet
[1:43:20] you ain't either
[1:43:22] but we're getting there
[1:43:24] if he can do it
[1:43:26] do it I can do it
[1:43:28] till I got the same Holy Ghost it's just
[1:43:30] what the desire I have to want it
[1:43:33] remember it's still a choice
[1:43:36] hoping someday see patient with him see
[1:43:38] temperate enduring with him knowledge to
[1:43:42] understand what he believes
[1:43:43] remember it's in his heart
[1:43:46] that's what is virtue and yourself
[1:43:49] to let it go out with kindness
[1:43:52] meekness to him having faith that
[1:43:56] someday
[1:43:57] got to bring him in

[1:44:19] Jesus said about
[1:44:20] brotherly kindness
[1:44:22] he said love your brother and love your
[1:44:24] neighbor
[1:44:25] as you love yourself

[1:44:38] love the sinner hate to sin
[1:44:44] and you know what they've asked us more
[1:44:46] about the message that we believe than
[1:44:48] our other neighbors have that are
[1:44:50] supposed to be
[1:44:51] good Baptists or good Methodist
[1:44:55] people are searching for things
[1:44:57] and let me report to you something

[1:47:34] We're not living in that day we're
[1:47:36] living in this day but we still have the
[1:47:38] same faith that we're going to find our

[1:48:11] [Music]
[1:48:14] he's standing for his wine
[1:48:18] [Music]

[1:48:44] [Music]
[1:48:58] born again
[1:49:02] born again
[1:49:04] there's been a change
[1:49:06] born again
[1:49:08] because somebody died
[1:49:09] [Music]
[1:49:11] there had to be the death of a testator
[1:49:13] so that a new testament could come into
[1:49:16] Force
[1:49:18] I like that brother George knew
[1:49:21] the Bible says you'll be a new creation
[1:49:24] a new creature
[1:49:28] they ain't a person in here that don't
[1:49:30] like to drive a new car
[1:49:32] not one
[1:49:35] smell
[1:49:36] no miles
[1:49:38] don't worry about breaking down Sister
[1:49:41] Barbara
[1:49:43] everybody likes new
[1:49:47] I like new revelation
[1:49:49] if my car gets me here that's okay
[1:49:53] but we all like new so when we say new
[1:49:55] that ought to sparked something in your
[1:49:57] heart I want to be a new creation
[1:49:59] I want God to show me something new
[1:50:02] remember you can't eat off of the off of
[1:50:04] the manna from yesterday
[1:50:06] you gotta eat off of the Mana from today
[1:50:09] and then tomorrow you gotta Aid off the
[1:50:11] Mana for tomorrow or for that day that
[1:50:13] you're at not for back care that's the
[1:50:15] same way with me and you to go up this
[1:50:17] statue of perfect man you've got to
[1:50:19] realize that he's making you new
[1:50:22] he's putting a new something you put
[1:50:25] whatever you want to he's doing a new
[1:50:27] work that you've never had done in your
[1:50:29] life because a revelation is something
[1:50:32] new it wouldn't be a revelation if it
[1:50:35] wasn't it just be whatever you are I
[1:50:36] mean like today
[1:50:38] you had to believe Sister Barbara was
[1:50:41] having trouble this morning with her
[1:50:42] battering still having a little bit I
[1:50:43] hope that's all fixed
[1:50:45] no we're going to pray that it does
[1:50:49] but you had faith that your card gets
[1:50:51] you to church you had faith
[1:50:55] let your wife picked out the right color
[1:50:57] clothes man those of y'all that do that

[1:51:09] because nothing's a surety
[1:51:12] but sister Annie you're here I'm looking
[1:51:13] at you
[1:51:14] you're at church you have arrived
[1:51:17] when you arrived at church you didn't
[1:51:19] have to believe I'm going to get here
[1:51:21] you're here
[1:51:23] apply that same thing
[1:51:25] with the word of God when you get a
[1:51:27] revelation I'm here
[1:51:29] when you get a new revelation I'm here
[1:51:34] you don't have to have faith anymore for
[1:51:36] coming to church you're here
[1:51:38] now enjoy what's here
[1:51:41] enjoy what's here now
[1:51:43] take what God's give you now
[1:51:47] don't worry about tomorrow the Bible
[1:51:48] Jesus tells us don't worry about
[1:51:50] tomorrow

[1:51:52] terms I hold tomorrow you don't
[1:51:56] put your trust in me I'll help you

[1:52:04] other day he said I hope the Rapture
[1:52:06] takes place Monday morning

[1:53:15] okay
[1:53:16] well we'll pray for that family we don't
[1:53:18] know why those things happen
[1:53:20] but we just have to put them in the
[1:53:21] hands of the Lord amen let the Lord deal
[1:53:24] with it deal with the family
[1:53:25] and what a tragedy thing
[1:53:30] there won't be no guns in heaven
[1:53:33] I don't mind guns
[1:53:36] but take certain times you need to put
[1:53:37] them up
[1:53:39] have a little wisdom
[1:53:42] a little Godly wisdom if you do carry if
[1:53:44] you're packing be careful what you're
[1:53:46] packing and who grabs hold of it all
[1:53:48] right life lesson 274 now we'll be here
[1:53:52] a while
[1:53:53] but just have just just keep those
[1:53:55] people in prayer goodness gracious
[1:53:57] that's tragic but you know what God's
[1:54:01] got that little child right now
[1:54:04] God got that little child you know what
[1:54:06] that child ain't got to worry about
[1:54:07] paying one bill
[1:54:09] you gotta look at it that way he's not
[1:54:11] gonna have any cancer no heartaches he's
[1:54:13] not gonna get gray head he's not gonna
[1:54:14] have to have shots
[1:54:18] he's in God's hands now and he'll be in
[1:54:20] heaven
[1:54:21] because all babies go to heaven
[1:54:24] hey man
[1:54:25] see you look at it that way and you
[1:54:27] think man
[1:54:28] that always said
[1:54:30] he said many people think it was a cruel
[1:54:33] God that in the Old Testament he would
[1:54:36] tell Joshua and them kill them all
[1:54:39] kill the babies
[1:54:40] kill the women
[1:54:42] kill the man God commanded them to do
[1:54:44] that
[1:54:45] right right
[1:54:46] God said Joshua you go you all can't
[1:54:48] kill them all
[1:54:50] Kill Them All
[1:54:52] well if you look at it that way he's a
[1:54:54] cruel God but if you look at it another
[1:54:56] way he saved all them millions of babies
[1:54:59] they'll be in heaven if they'd grown up
[1:55:01] to be bigger malachites God had already
[1:55:04] cursed him Malachi
[1:55:05] and he would have sent them all to hell
[1:55:08] but he let that happen like I said
[1:55:11] before
[1:55:12] think of the people that's being good to
[1:55:14] you
[1:55:15] that's been tragically killed or or
[1:55:17] something happened to them
[1:55:21] God's going to give them eternal life
[1:55:22] because of you so why let them hang
[1:55:24] around here
[1:55:25] why make them go through a tribulation
[1:55:28] folks you ain't seen nothing yet it's
[1:55:29] going to be hard you talk about shooting
[1:55:33] this nation when God leaves this nation
[1:55:36] with us out of here
[1:55:39] they gonna be killing each other right
[1:55:41] and left
[1:55:42] that thing in Louisville's uh not even a
[1:55:46] blip on the radar compared to what's
[1:55:48] coming

[1:55:51] will not have to be there
[1:55:53] we might see a little bit of persecution
