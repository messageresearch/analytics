TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] yeah yeah no thank you all right yeah we can see it from here by that you might think that you've only got the Richard setup only for you laughs a dental video and audio only for did you ask did you ask Johnny you're looking at me oh alright let's break he became a father we thank you for its get together today for another Sunday School lesson services today the previous lesson is done - growing especially the gorge yourself especially so the idea for this lesson came from a lot of recent events I want to try to talk slower and louder I'm not naturally that way okay so you could help me raise your hands you can't hear me okay please I really am not good at that but especially from the recent fellowship meeting on the late nights and comments about this stuff being shook the show Chuck and all those things and I've written a letter to brother down about what I had noticed not only on that service but especially in that service more than I've ever noticed it before about basically two groups of people that I've seen in the midst of regular is basically the those seeking an indwelling of the Holy Ghost and those seeking an anointing that's right and I'm not going to say it's wrong to secret anointing I think we ought to but really that won't hold you during the time that I was given and it won't really you turn the hand please away from you are all just whichever it's our top people go to a hug people maybe down back thank you June July by that you know I'm not saying anybody's wrong in saying that you know he continued on so I want to go through some folks I'm just going to kind of speed through these these are ones y'all are probably very familiar with and then get to my actual lesson modern events make clear about policy the inside you have a spirit when we leave in the yellow there and there you have five outlets your conscience and love and so forth five outlets to that spirit remember in that spirit you can be baptized with the genuine Spirit of God and still be lost it's the soul that lives it was her name of God you know so now what happened to me that was so profound in that service that brother way of priests here that Saturday that fellowship meeting was starting probably three weeks or so a student brother Dale started announcing that he was coming I started praying for brother William and I made a habit of doing that over the years not just fellowship meetings not just special ministers but all of our fivefold ministry when I know I am going to preach how I start praying for him and and that's just part of this one little testimony so I had already been in a prayerful attitude about it the day of I think it was that from the way in preached me and Gabby were doing our daily Bible reading and we came across Matthew 13 and we read that that day before brother William preached and then I came across that one word understanding a couple times it's mentioned there in Matthew 13 and I've tapped on an electic art about to look at the Strong's Concordance a bit seems to help me understand exactly what that word means in that context so I just prayed about it and they're not even out loud Gavin and you know it's right now I think I just think over them myself I'm fault in our reading and I just looked at that my said Lord just tell me how much I love that mate and Lord of the whole bar the waiter preached his title was he that understanding sort of like a God incidents and the whole entire tournament he was preaching about the difference between understanding versus knowledge you know having a hidden knowledge versus understand he said it's a revelation that's what understanding it so in my mind looking sitting back to there this little big man that I am nobody sitting back there on the corner I would think if God would look down congregation he'd say all these people that are so sincere and seeking of anointing and putting themselves out there and really you know energetic and everything and praising God doing the song service and gobble it down and bless them but they became and instead kind of bypassed over family came down there's still nobody in that corner to your question that's how profound got to work look over all these other things where you think the blessing should belong and go to some little nobody an entire state open to the answer but at the same time I noticed like I said in that service so profound the two distinguishable groups after anointing secrets in the dwelling state is there and in a row brother Delta Lincoln letter about that and then brought later in the comments about the shuttle sure it's the best watch shows that Tyler hunt that will help you kind of remember what we're talking about and maybe make it stick to you and I'm not just talking about the people that came here for the dust man okay there are people into this group in our church and in every Church over there in the North thing here they want to see a preacher get up there and sweat and thereon and shower and then little William Bulevar gets up there little bitty guy because there don't even break a sweat not a girl almost wet didn't shout and yet the most profound and Arlington discerning what was on my mind on my heart and carried out an answer that's romantic I mean I thought this running the island not doing damn thing wrong with that that's right but to master their graded marketing when Johnson stood up there indiscernible is in my mind right William not knowing it masterpiece Oh God let's back up a little bit she was in view receive the same time she was for review the first time the bride then she was reviewed the second time and she was perfectly the second time like she was the first time Oh God have mercy hurry hurry hurry laughs get in the drain right quick they talked about coming out of the shove the Pentecostal owner to show the carrier it was necessary that they'll Pentecostal it should happen that's work she revels message was sent but then people sat in it when they didn't move out of industrial that's at this day many people are sitting in that the only ones at the end time the left keeps advancing on but remember it's in another state it can't remain in that stage we can eat the a carrion of some other age we can't be Pentecostal Carey and Methodists or Baptists Terry we have fresh fruit the work of this hour what was each messenger what was Martin Luther a rebuke to the Catholic what was Wesley a rebuke to them Lutheran what was the Pentecost Arab youth to their mothers where has the left are now away from an organization no more shop it's the grain what is it a rebuke to the Pentecost imminency to fulfill the scripture of this our images place can receive it neither can a man receive it and stay in his denomination who have to follow the wheat or go with the show either one he wants the about there is a decision to be made that's right each of us has to decide where we want to go one of the hawkmen wanna sit with the feel-good group or move on over to the group where the worst thing for everything and we're talking about right which feels pretty good too sure when God looks over a whole crowd of people not that nobody got anything I know a lot of people got something on that service but if you respect that also make them look more expecting something myself and God I felt good there's no house and like they're crying this I know this problem of them all himself sure is thinking about money yet so this shows free moral agency are they sure okay not then push the reply we'll get to that later on I think I'm not that quote for Charlotte's maybe with the election is not God pushing us to the path it's based on this poor knowledge of our choice I have her McNasty said the corner late fall into the ground had to dive through those dark ages like any other corner weight has to go beneath earth and be buried to break forth in the first Reformation then two blades of Luther to stop it had to grown forth in the Westland up Joyner to bring forth the pollen the tassels the great missionary had to come forth in the Pentecostal for the restoration he has promised to deceive the very elect it looks like a wheat grain open it up there's no weight there at all it's only shot right this is a continuation of that quote mounts begin to pull away the weeks begin to be sim this is not a pentecostal edges as the latter decades since the bride age this is the evening life this is when Malachi 4 must be fulfilled to follow God's pattern this is Luke 1730 to be fulfilled this is the second and Jeremiah and all the rest are the Joel spoke oh these days this is that day I've heard Lord and it was coming but now I say bleep I've already covered all this and then there's also okay I'm pointing this lesson towards those that are in the stuff and those who are seeking I'm wanting but also at the same time I'm gearing this toward those who are still asleep spiritually okay very much I see a program today that even our congregation they're people even reading the Bible every day going to church every service from seeking God's and said early and yet you can still a miss about be asleep just like the freeze just like the Pharisees were 2,000 years ago the missus in Christ though they were very sincere and very adamant astronomical images so the rapture out of their combat perceiving age that Pentecostal age that's more of wait anybody ever hear ever raise any weight you look at that weight when you look at it when you go out there say I've got weight you look like you got weight there but open it up real close and watch you haven't got no weight at all you got a show did jesus warned us of that matthew 24 in the last days that the two spirits would be so close together would receive the elected wheat itself if it was possible as he watches a carrier the Seventh Seal this is sort of interesting how this truck mail was yesterday morning preparedness PowerPoint and at the same time I was kind of going through my notes and listening to the seals and reading ourselves a long seven so message I was asking God you know to find the quote pertaining to this lesson what we're fixing to get into and I came to right across it right there in the middle of my study and prepared for this message this lesson you're still not until the next revival when your one cell with the Holy Ghost it's the finished work that God has received you that's right and there's no getting away from okay you musters God must receive your sacrifice right you come to bring the Dasara yourself to be awed you commit yourself to God and you keep moving on through sanctification brother Aaron is the first one I'm never here it's about not stopping and sanctification in fact in 2002 I think of three it reached that I was this period of sanctification for the first time so but I've never really stopped going through that process of sanctification but just don't ever stop that I'll never stop seeking because you're tempted to think when you reach sanctification that you're already not you know that you already go with the Holy Spirit the way I'm about to catch up so after you approach him give yourself to him consecrate yourself for me to him he baptizes you with the Holy Ghost and you're absolutely know when this takes place I and this is one thing we've heard quite a bit here Dean him and if you just take your own mind of thinking reason they like Eve did at the beginning they can explain everything of the bottle away from here but if a man let me stop there for a second if you're in the anointing part of it if you're just looking for anything electing really you can you can have anything work really explain the way from you look I think to this move from church to church wherever you find out what you just tossed about to and I throw that every wind of doctrine but if a man a woman ever has been on the backside of the desert and those sacred sands where no intellectual can stand and there come in contact with the Living God no devil no scientist or anything else can ever explain that away you were there it happened you know it's the truth there's no one can take it away from me you meant God and I believe that God every age singing for the messenger always first meets that person on a sacred ground because it's got to be so oh so I mean I have read the book the prince of the house of David alright so we bought it come on Segoe and we started reading it meaning that we do and what I find in that book is the same thing that's happening today John the Baptist family if you're not familiar with the base for this girl Dinah I think it's how you say her name this Jewish girl she goes back to homeland they should go back to Jerusalem happens to be there at the time of John the Baptist was coming on the scene and this is sort of a fiction story but there's a lot of parts that you know that you could prove maybe by the Bible or at least speculate and there's a lot of characters in the Bible that are introduced and coming to the story and what they're all doing is this girl and her visitor uncle rabbi something grabbed by famous and then many other people that she encounters are trying to attack in the scripture and see if this man John the Baptist could really be fulfilling you know Malachi when did melt a 3-run could really be fulfilling that and they're just checking every little bit of his life and then Jesus comes on the scene and they start to check his life with the scripture so what they're doing is the people who saw Elijah of that day and saw Jesus and that day were the ones who were the most studying and praying and seeking God and fern every bit of their lives to see if they match the stretcher whereas say the Pharisees would maybe study look into it say no he could be he was born in Bethlehem with and they said actually is born he was born in Bethlehem and then and so on so forth basically they're checking they're trying they're they're searching the scriptures as he said and then you think you have eternal life from there they're testifying me and aren't they Elijah came in and and Jesus is coming again all the same Christ and the headstone and people are missing them even if they're reading and praying missing them because of tradition and ideas and all those things so what I like about that book is you really pay close attention and just watch how people some groups miss them and some groups see them a lot of most sincere on the other side but you know there's just basically those who are willing to hear and those who are really seeking the time to farm the truth other ones that prime it okay so read that book we bought a couple of them that we want to give out to anybody who doesn't have one just basically we got three here found order and horror if you want one and if you'll read it okay I just said I'm here for help those are for anybody and then if you want some more let me know it'll be glad it worked together and was on these seven dollars pretty cheap okay I'll be glad to order ten more if any by the reader to know but I'm at on that adamant about it because I say something in that this happening again today I just really want you all to see exactly what's happening that's the aisle okay for me the banner makes reference to a law it would be good if you picked it up and read it it's really good the prince of the house of David all I showed of that just so I could say your prophets arias I've heard that quote for years here is important finally bought it also your master said also fictitional bunion trick pilgrims progress your pastor actually said probably a year ago I guess he said something he said I think you should read that book and I'd already listened to the audiobook that you get a lot out of it I finally bought on Amazon and man there's a lot of Nuggets and Avenue will just sit and have just long conversations about these little allegories these little stories and type scene and this sort of this stuff this things there's different principles that you face in the Christian life that's that now start the lesson objective to see that if you do what God requires won't you be accepted this goes back to Cain and Abel thanks to clean you know that in the story of Cain and Abel both of them sincere any difference was Abel had a revelation of what God will fire does provide a place to worship and so forth Abel it was blood was a part but Cain said God take it or leave it that could we fall in that category about reading and praying and studying and come to church and listening to sermons and stillness in Christ sure because the contests are importantly just stop they just don't make me please sincere enough or maybe don't have it here to hear just not really looking not really expecting and this isn't really sounding arrogant but later on if I have time I want to get into something about mine and Gabby's story and I know a lot of people nuns make on the area and your exalted or what have you but I don't know what to talk to you about except from my story about how the and said tell them how you're fired I see these minutes I see them coming up and I see how they did it is making themselves available to God and really being sincere and and then I started doing the same thing and have the same result so if you there's that won't you be accepted originator so as long as you fusses from the Godhead explain when you brother bill asked us to listen to as long as you first you're both wrong see because this is about brother sitting brother Ness okay don't take sides with every one of you brethren as long as you fuss you're both wrong see because I would rather be wrong and my doctrine and rot in my heart than to be arrived in my doctrine and wrong in my heart see after all is your heart condition God is in his work was when we're real familiar with that the right mental attitude for any divine promise of God way of the past the right mental attitude but you've got to have the right attitude the attitude it's what brings the results they approach to God what I did on it through that sermon and just picked up several different quotes and I made reference to and there if you want to look them up but just basically things that is part of our approach to God through the shedding of blood brings the approach to God making a burnt sacrifice for each one to have a way of approach to God God seen the honesty and sincerity and before you can ever become a partaker of this blessed heavenly calling you have to come through the provided approach not self-sustaining not intellectually but death to yourself and are reborn again in Christ Jesus through the offering of the blood you'll never see it and you can't approach it until you die out to those things and come God's provided way of approach given which is Jesus Christ being filled with the Holy Spirit God provide a way for Senator Tom so this is approach to not shedding our blood the honesty and sincerity to the death to yourself and reborn again across Jesus to the offering the blood and Gotha provider approach which is Jesus Christ being filled with the Holy Ghost home scary these are some of the things this is me on brother ground that things are some of the things that I think of when you talk about attitude and approach to God faith worth not just not just believing because the devil believes but I mean faith is a revelation and sincerity desperation hunger and thirst for righteousness yes those righteousness shall be filled so be really desperate that's for the parish ear to hear have a emphasis on fivefold ministry about how much loud just about that hey what Oh excellent that doesn't want with some fridge magnets you know Riley everybody doing some more fridge magnets no but I used it this effort and it's really good okay put them on your fridge contract part willingness to take correction okay and over it's when you're wrong no matter how long you go believe in something you see correction and another thing is attitude is not saying why do we need this from the dead let's talk about people of incarnation to say we need this or you know belittling basically what's happening cuz what what is happening here is Jesus Christ is speaking to us on a five fold ministry and you're standing there lightly esteeming him missing donning simplicity because thanks from Pastor that's just brother way that's just for the bar you know and you're missing them across them these brothers you think it's down and in reality it's actually Christ even a bit of a brother and that's where you can miss Christ and simplicity okay prophet is not without honor except in his own so don't just sit in a message search in this thing I believe you're not elected data make sure that configure one this is a mainly following the statute placing ham and your faith virtue and virtue moment and down the first date for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you'll neither be barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but neither lack of these things is blind cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sense wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make their calling and election sure for he knew these things from their fault or so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our own Savior Jesus Christ in us I'm just a second okay right being elected of God does not mean the way I push therapod we have something to do even Jesus stands in the door knocks in the door the driver made herself ready anoint thine eyes with ourselves these are all acts of all these are the things that we do study to show thyself approved and then these are actions taken by us abroad so election is based on God's foreknowledge of what we choose we already going to that Sun and in Matthew 11 brother father talked about this a while back in a Sunday School lesson talked about being violent Christians you know he said and for Matthew 11 jesus said you know of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take of my portrait all right porch means claim for oneself eagerly it means to be eager think about violence its violence is never something spontaneous or sporadic it's really something that's premeditated right you meditate on something before you do it you know Jesus in the temple when you chased out the money changers tables and all them turn the tables over and all those that were selling he probably looked like a terrorist you know it's a lot of people who are outside watching him he probably thought this phase of terrorists but he was looking like he was being violent when he sat down premeditated that you know that was something he thought out beforehand and when you're seeking God and you're coming to God you do it in such a way that you're eager you're violent and you're meditating on your thinking on these things all the time that's Rory not discouraged you're not deterred nothing involuntary about it it's always something intentional right in your line focus never down the fivefold ministry is given ordained by God and must not be like the esteem Ephesians 4:11 and he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors teachers but affecting the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the sun-god to a perfect man to the measure of the stature of the Florence price that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men crafts were above the line wait to receive God is simplicity hiding in a group of men people teaching and preaching office on all the big things okay babies for Less continuation of that but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ ever in the head stone age this is today from that fork from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies according to the effectual working in the measure a very part meant an increase of the body unto the edifying of self and low as I say therefore testify on the Lord that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind have any understanding Darkman this is what by the wings preaching about one or me about being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because the box of the heart [Applause] [Music] that was yeah take one down and pass it around is there are two step with on the instructions with some step one put it on your fridge step 2 grab a beverage and until I want you to read it meaning think about it a lot okay yep that well call it boy actually this one a pretty good bit I think I've done this before and Romans 13:11 and that knowing the time that it's now that it is now time to awake out of sleep for now is our salvation nearer than when we believe the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of the dark odorous let's turn the honors black okay speaking of the possible ministry this is just a quiz based on brother Bell sermon from September 17th even the service that day I'm not doing this to show you how much I know work or try to make you feel like you don't know anything I'm simply doing this to show you how much you can miss someone a brother Dale sermon because everybody says he's repeating themself me he's breathing too simple and all these things bro to people whichever other but if you just go over this quiz in their own time we won't have time really and just answer these questions and think about this thing but mostly just think about how much you could miss if you are not really paying attention and something me and Gabby both do regular it's go back to listen to the sermons even though we're here for me they go back and listen to I've been over and over and over until I really feel like I've got it you think because you can miss a whole lot of nuggets even when you're sitting here in the and I'm not saying go to the next slide to follow the thoughtful man if it means more than just coming to church and listening which should be listening to sermons of our ministers at home we should also do the homework assignments sort of like the book that has to have the prince of the house of David and that he'll be progress but especially with brother Dale goes way any brother says to read or listen to a certain firmament that is really crucial that you do it because they don't you stay focused on the work that's being brought your intuitive way don't just be with it I mean and you don't remember you get a little piece of paper and a pen go the long way or just on your hand you know I'm not saying you have to do these things to me today but you will want to do them if God tells you something through brother Dale or any of these ministries and you ignore it you're doing the same thing as tank you know your things all this is all I'm gonna do take it or leave it so is your attitude to God and you are really sincere and really desperate will show it to God through your eyes I'll start on this topic don't think we'll get very far but this is an asset that's gonna look like a thin area but man Gaby have established the marriage consecrated the Christ the idea came into my mind for doing that when I was a little 15 year old Baptist kid we had a youth pastor in our youth group on Wednesday nights the whole entire thing of the youth group from Winston oxwas see he first became a dog Matthew 6:33 they taught us all these different lessons about seeking God and that's the perfect thing for a kid to hear at that age the most important thing to teach any kid in that age from age 12 to 20 they seek God first and so he also said within that time of that lesson they gave us a little diagram of a triangle or pyramid which everyone call it and said this is how when you get married someday this is how you should do it that you should have a marriage where and of course leads to these lines signifying relationships so husband wife of America have a relationship duh then husband has relationships individually with God okay in other words he's seeking God in his own private prayer time and quiet time why black was okay but then collectively they read the Bible together and they pray together they go to church together talk about the Lord together do all these things together and in that the marriage will be blessed just the same as if you're if you do those individually what my father says is secret they were weren't you opening because so if you want your marriage to be blessed and then you do these things just is you doing the vigil and it's not to substitute the individual prayer time you still pray and read and see God individually but into your marriage and watch how God will bless your marriage and sustain I've never seen a marriage based on this actually fell by how same one come unraveled because a three-fold cord is not quickly broken but I've never seen one actually felt if they establish this and then maintain it day in and day out for years and years you read and pray and study together to every day keep seeking God and I there's several examples of this brother and sister Dale don't know don't know how much I meet them on the highway but every time I meet them on the road I'm in the chicken truck somehow they see me sometimes it all nice and they're looking at them brother nails doing this talk because somebody met passengers say they think more they're sitting there talking about you and then I say little bitty hands I haven't asked any of these couples that they do it but Bob and Monica she was reading the youth wrote a book on the way to church the other day just an example okay the little things that you do and the relationship and I'll pick up on the weeks and Christine went visited them in their house for the first time last Saturday and all over the house is from into being a blank message books and the little things that they go from doing Rachel or a prime example I'm not time to set up anybody saying you're not doing this I'm just saying these are examples of and watch their hands be blessed okay get all the way through there you save something please ask these for 1200 km from I got this picked off and the three phone cord of marriage is not quickly broken and I said I've seen it broken but that was because one of those three four threefold cords came unraveled a I've seen America started that way maintain that for a decade at least in the man max live the woman stayed going to church reading about friends at the man started to get back away from God and within about ten years I watched America crumble and they're divorced today so it has to be established and maintained younger sister there in the time that that scam B was actually adopted by her adoptive family this message will even receive her in their homes when she was in that condition this was around town was just trying to kill herself right or a short after but she was trying to commit suicide because she was depressed and I'm just showing you this to show you how how the Lord get ahold of somebody all right and this is Gabby after the or got ahold of her and when she came in to that message blaming home she she took up with the message and began studying a privacy God this is how much I have to say about this but basically just to sum it up I wanted to establish that marriage based on making price in our marriage and year exactly meant this is this is one year after we met this was after we got engaged she wasn't happy because she makes bigger pictures okay when I had it up a bit down in this place this is at a youth camp about this campground in Kentucky George was there joist and hope they carpooled together think up there and me and my thing was talking to us at the very moment when I first saw Gabby and went over to this literal spot and introduced myself to her and asked her to come into the fellowship issue sitting there by herself and she was sitting on a rock between two trees and this established something that's repeated over and over and over in our marriage but keep seeing these symbology zuv Christ and all lives consecrated to Christ okay I did not say this this is not the reason I married her I didn't say well you sent me in sign I should marry this room actually found a sign of indication from His Word and that's what I've had a thought for but years my father years into our marriage this is why we're getting to sleep this and then it repeated let's have one our multiplication that's the same this is one of the many places where this thing repeated when I went up there and after that but there marry her and go and get our wedding bands that they asked her she'd come pick out our wedding bands because I think they're we got she picked out these that we have are now that have the crosses on them and we like to preserve a process and we've never realized till later they'll meet train but ever really pay attention to the symbology there again is that same thing across on either side of these rocks or diamonds okay showing Christ now on either side of these two lives Christian lives concentrating the Christ okay what I'm saying is if you honor God double honor you if you put them in your marriage put them in your parenting and in your job and everything you do you watch Connor those look good and see God and all those things welcome our stay about that I'll just all that so next week [Music]
