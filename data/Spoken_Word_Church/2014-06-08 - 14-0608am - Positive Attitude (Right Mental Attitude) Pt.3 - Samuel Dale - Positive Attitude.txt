I believe that's right at verse 9 of Romans 1. we've had two two meetings three three meetings we've got I think nine verses eight or nine verses but we're doing good it don't matter we'll we'll get dark but I'm enjoying it anyway so we've been having a good time doing it but just remember that remember the ones that are away from us for the weekend Richard and and Anna and Abby Grace and uh brother Aaron and Sarah and the boys are up at uh the Dales today so remember them remember all the others the different ones and remember the now to the brothers that are going to go with the uh Father's Day fishing trip which will be starting this Thursday uh if you would meet after the more the evening service this evening just for a few minutes to lay out what we need to do you know for uh a chance to be able to go to our father's day trip and I understand that the sisters are going to try to get together and some of them are going to be doing things and and then they said there's going to go I believe the moles or somewhere to eat so you know all of you want to go that's you're very welcome we can't set a date for everybody we'd kind of talked about changing the Father's Day weekend meeting because of some that couldn't go but then we found out that some couldn't go the other way so might as well leave it alone and you know and just go and do the best we can but it'll be trying to help us to understand and we always have a good time fellowshipping together there and if you like to play horseshoes you you find out who the champ is to the crowd around here and uh we don't have no problem with that we make Tony throw backwards he can't pitch for the rest of us he either has one handicap one way or the other he has to to walk 10 Paces back or something because he wins too much but you know but we have a good time doing it and a good time fellowshipping all right and then brother Bob black will be preaching this coming Wednesday so remember that and just pray that the Lord would bless is that all the announcements I'm gently missed something Romans 10. the heavenly father we thank you for this day we love you and we thank you for your presence Among Us you've been here in the singing and the worshiping Lord and praying and the Sunday School classes and the doings Lord and we just appreciate you the little children Lord they love to come by every day and show me what they've done I like that Lord because we encourage them to to be and do and help and the teachers to work with them we love you father for you love the little children and father we we just thank you for all things and we ask you to guide us now as we speak about you you come on the scene and open your word unto us that we may walk in the light of Your Love forgive our sins cover Us by the blood and keep us in Jesus name Amen brother Doherty said Sister Mary was doing pretty good she's able to get up and doing some walking and thanks she's still having trouble with the blood pressure so pray for her that the Lord will straighten that out and get everything right but she is able we were down the other day and she just stuck both hands up when the lady in the doctor or something said can you move your arms was she just you know and she doesn't have any slurred or speech and he said the swelling's going down so all right thank God for for doing that we believe it we expect it uh thank God for touching brother out there Wednesday night when you've been having trouble trying to get his arm to go up after the operation well then he'd be sitting there and try to move it up well like Wednesday night while as the Bible says he sent his word and healed us why Wade was preaching he just and raised his arm we thank God for that that's God's word my life and we believe it right Romans 10. 13. for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved how then shall they he hey they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher all right so we got that right don't make no nothing out of us it makes a great God doesn't it and how shall they preach except they be sent now that's the point right amen and it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things they have not all obeyed the gospel prize said Lord who hath believed our report so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing how by the word of God you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now I'm trying to get a point across to all of us you know and uh helping us to see something about who we are amen because it does no good to know who everybody else is and what they're doing that's fine but to know who we are and what we're doing and the hour that we're living in our time and seeing that you know the end of all things has come upon us surely we believe that about the way the world is going and everything's happening you know and we don't set no dates we don't set no times we don't worry about that it's just the prophet said that the one thing he saw that was holding off the coming of the Lord was what the Readiness of the Bride all right see then that's what's holding it off the Readiness of the Bride see and we believe that all right so then we're trying to talk about a positive attitude you know a positive if anybody ought to have a positive attitude in order to be the bride of Christ in this end time because now uh you had problems down through the ages of lack of of uh information abilities Etc uh you know you had problems with even not having the equipment to do with but see now we have we can read the Bible we can read The Prophet's message we can do all of the things and and all like that because we're in the end time there's never an age it's been like this even the great writings of Paul and Peter and them are not compared and get me right what I'm saying now they're not compared for the amount that you and I have of the ability to be able to study the word of God all right and in doing that then my point I've asked a question and I want to ask it many times of us because I want us to think why are we any different than any other denomination cult oh we don't we're not a caught brother Dale well you know all it takes is one person to be one it doesn't take a whole group you know and all it takes is one person to be a denomination you don't have to have a whole group with you you can be one by yourself you can pull back and you're a little Shale and you know be a denomination yourself all right but what has been my point that I've asked what is the difference between us and the other churches all right now if you've been listening to me you can't put it on uh well we got this and where we got that oh you know remember you got to Anchor it into something you can talk about the message that we have and that's true but remember each age had a message right his church age had a messenger and a message all right see then what makes us different than any other age or any other peoples and the main thing that I've tried to bring it to you is that the end of all things has come and there's not another age to come so this is the last age so it's a wonderful time in an age but what do we put it on well we believe this we believe God sent a prophet they believe Luther was a man of God for their day all right they still quote Luther and and claiming that but you see then we can wind up and be as big a cult denomination Etc as anybody else has ever been by our own sales of not having something personal because you can't have a positive attitude if you don't have something personal that's my whole point if you don't have something personal to you you don't have a positive attitude you've got a mental makeup mental makeup to just trying to be something a positive attitude now what have I said about a positive attitude a positive attitude is not people that there's people in this world that are totally positive you can't get them to talk negative whatsoever you know they're positive about everything they're positive about this positive about that but that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about why or how come you got a positive attitude in Bible terminologies those who had a problem had a positive attitude was those who had a personal experience in their time and that's what made them positive we're getting down to the end of it there on Sunday you know that brother random said it and I'll review it a minute he said I like what job said job didn't say I think I believe what job says I know my redeemer living all right see that's a positive attitude that that I know doesn't mean I hope it was something revealed to him amen or it would have been mental thoughts and Concepts but it wasn't that it was something personal to him God has spoke to his heart well as he spoke to you and I am or what makes it different to anything else as far as putting side by side you can find churches in the denominational churches that the women don't cut their hair don't paint their face don't wear vulgar clothing and all the men they look like men and who you can see that in denominational churches well is that the only difference there he is you know is it just something that we have done we were talking about something last night that really gets me and I told them about it in the Bible study what gets me is is the people of this message now that are falling away you know claiming brother Brown was wrong or this was this or that or the other are you know oh how come that the women start out cutting their hair painting their face and putting on shorts and the men start doing basically about the same thing now come on you know it's right that man stood right here in this Pulpit a few years ago priests probably his first sermon away from home and preached a good message a few weeks later he heard that brother Branham was wrong about the dates of the county the pillar of fire and a different thing and he just went out of the message went back into the world well you know what if we went back in the world it meant he never did have nothing now you tell me come on sisters you tell me that because the pastor backslides the prophet would backslide or somebody would backslide it's going to put you Contour to this word this word says for you not to cut your heart this word says for you not to paint your face this word says for you not to do these things what doings is it why is it that people automatically they run back to the World when they backslide was because it didn't have anything right what does it matter where you could prove that brother Branham was wrong or whatever this Bible says this Bible teaches what a baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ this Bible teaches one God are we going to deny truth even if we could prove a message fella was wrong about something come on it means we didn't have nothing to start with we had a mental concept and like Joyce was one that was really good last night talking about because she came up to it she was raised up through the message you didn't cut your heart he didn't paint your face why because you're scared to death you're gonna get a whooping if you did well that was the best way of her saying it right that was a good way of saying it it wasn't a revelation then the prophet says you can't get a Holy Ghost Field woman but to put on a pair of pants you couldn't get a holy ghost feel warmer to cut her hair or wear makeup once she's heard the truth now until we hear the truth we're not responsible but then when the truth comes well that's my whole point what is the difference between us and anything else yeah any other church or systems of doing if you took and not call names but just put this group compared to this group the worldly churches that we call them a lot of times would outweigh us in their giving and caring and loving but what's our idea they're not in the message so we ain't gonna help them right in here and then we'll help them we're not to go out there and try to get them where did that end at you understand could it be that we have as we talked about that most of our faith you know the word faith means revelation is mental you mean if they could prove to you brother around and been married five times that you do away with water baptism I ain't gonna do that because he was wrong that means he's based on him if brother Dale backslides go down in the world and lost does that mean but the Bible's not right and the prophet's not right but see we use those things as crutches or excuses what does it matter this prophet's message has led me to an understanding of God that I didn't have prior to them so I thank God for the understanding right right if a dumb donkey tells you the truth you're supposed to rejoice you don't beat the Donkey right you're supposed to rejoice but see if the most of our faith then is mental then what have we got you are you understanding me we know and was covering Sunday that Peter he said if that be thee Lord bid me come he said come Peter stepped right out on the water and started walking until he began to see the circumstances that was around him and he began to sink and the prophet gave a great illustration of what on perfect faith and I'd suggest you you listen to that message or read it but he he said Peter lost his substance but still had his profession and like I said it's not written you know that he was splashing and slumbering and trying he started sinking before he was too far down he's began to cry out and he lost not he he lost the substance under him but somehow that substance got put back in him because I don't think Jesus had to struggle to pull him up and then lift him up and carry back into the boat he just put back under him what was under him and he walked right back into the boat right all right just trying to show you a point that he never lost his profession he said Lord help me all right well see then if that be true then he went from a substance under him by believing Jesus Christ to be God and he lost that substance part but he still had his confession of who Jesus was could we be that away right amen proud remember the only thing in Peter in one minute and the next minute was the fact that he lost the substance he had under his feet because the next minute he was in the boat he got back some way so he had his confession it's all we have a confession or is it a revelation you mean somebody could come along in the message what they're doing now and it's confusing a lot of people right with great philosophies and preaching and claiming this Prophet taught this and he taught that and and deceiving the people true until how great followings well there was something wrong with the person who follows those things they lost their substance they lost their great revelation they put a gun to your head one day and said do you believe that Jesus Christ to be almighty God it's going to be a decision then of whether or not you say yes or no if you've got a substance you'll say yes but if you've got a confession you'll say well I don't know he's all not they're not not going to do it's been happening before in time we we think we're in a day when things can't take place all right you better life at that and get out of your thoughts you know but if the biggest portion of our faith is mental faith and remember we went through that you're not saved by mental faith we went through that you were not healed by mental faith but you must have mental Faith first mental faith is based upon the word of God Amen but our problem is instead of it being what we read in verse 17 so then faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God it must be that somebody is messing with the food you know what I mean the word's not coming forth in his purity because if it is it'll have the same results go to the same word all right so then mental faith the prophet said on Blasphemous names the biggest portion of our faith is mental faith you see memory fight studying the word of God he said brings us to a mental recognition a mental recognition all right wonderful we've got to have that there's nobody in the Bible ever got the holy ghost that didn't hear the word of God first now come on show it to him in the Bible they heard the word first before they got the Holy Ghost all right and he said we went through these quotes he said if you haven't received the Holy Ghost there's something wrong with your faith you remember that something wrong with your faith because God said repent every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost well I don't understand how come God hadn't give it to me I've done everything I thought could be done well it just must be that it's not meant for me well okay you just took your past self out of the situation because you know what your confession is it's not meant for you so it's not meant for you well no no you shouldn't talk like that I've done everything I could do I repented I've got baptized I've done everything I could do don't understand how come I didn't get the Holy Ghost there's something wrong somewhere because God made the promise so now we're either saying God is a liar or we're the liar so that's that's no problem right is that any problem I think we know who that is I think we know who the liar is and we say we've done everything but I'm not going to give up yeah oh okay come on I'm not going to quit oh but yet we love to quote what people say and you know people that said those things maybe got an experience I remember in the Baptist Church because I don't run around and come along and told it later I believe it was Buddy Robinson I'm not certain about that name but anyhow the man said he went out in the cornfield and got that on his knees and he said God if you don't give me the Holy Ghost he said then you'll find a pile of bones right now you're in this field well you know what he got the Holy Ghost when how many people went out in the field and got that on their knees as we call it her closet or or whatever you're doing and saying now God you're going to find a pile of bones right here if you don't give me the Holy Ghost well then it don't come is it God's fault or is it our fault which one are we going to base it on well Lord I've come I've confessed all of my wrongs I've done everything you know and why haven't you give me the Holy Ghost all right now let's suppose you have done that and it doesn't come suppose you have gotten rid of everything and you're right you know all right but you see what you're trying to do is you're trying to make God come on the scene and save you instead of doing what he's saying what is it in Romans worth it we confess with the mouth and believe in the heart but then what we want to do is like in the upper room experience with the disciples remember the prophet explaining that a little bit one day he said one of them was probably saying well I think we got it you know we've seen the sick Hill we've seen the dead rays in our ministry and he told us to come and wait but he didn't say how long so let's just take it by faith he said somebody stood up in the crowd and said wait a minute we don't have what he said well the rest of y'all stay up here if you don't I'm going to take it by faith go ahead go out the door go to the guy waiting out there with a knife on you I just changed my Doctrine I'm coming back with y'all not being silly being truthful when you put on the spot you find out whether or not you got the goods right right as I said a moment ago then let somebody try to talk you out off the revelation of one God that's good for you is really good for you for somebody to just get all over you amen and just scream and holler right and quote scriptures to you right every kind of thing cause we'll get down if we get time we don't just seen it you know God loves to test your faith see after you've done all to do or the prophet say stand well that's what the Bible said stand what we think we can do remember he doesn't do it as a demanding point you remember I told you about the preacher that told me one day he said I'm not I'm not working on command of the devil so I'm working on commanding the Lord yeah it's scripture the Bible says commands ye me well I told him I said that doesn't mean what you're interpreting it to mean because you don't demand anything from God you accept it by faith and you believe it and it's up to him to bring to pies what's your confession is right right so what you've done all you can do and you're standing right to stand but I I just can't do I stood for two years how about you two years I confessed after coming in this message not before I was a deacon for home for five or six years I was teaching adult Sunday School classes and things I saw many signs and wonders many things before I ever heard of this message but when I heard this man talking about a new birth it wasn't an emotional work-up situation that he was explaining it was a person he was talking about and when he began to talk about that person I knew that person was living in me well I mean he's in the message you believe it here's a dick and you're doing all these things see I knew there was something wrong now what would have happened if I'd have done like most people as the preacher told me you're in the message why don't you claim you got the Holy Ghost another just take it by faith well I was trying my best to me but you can't make God do what you want him to do don't try it wait on him we're waiting the right way does that mean by Peter Peter's still had his confession you are God get me back where I was gonna be recognized as the only way he could be saved but you see we think that we it's because we know the message but that means we're saved but we think we know the Bible that means we're saved and it was talking about last night you know that brother Branham never come to correct this book that I'm holding up here called the Bible he come to tell us that this Bible is right and even the the ends and the butts is in the right place well how come we didn't understand it because of what we'd been taught he didn't change the teaching of it the Bible never taught a trinity but secretly taught of one God and he finally showed us the secrets what do you understand the biggest portion of our faith is mental faith but now mental faith is like this let's see this is where I wrote it down you can act like you're healed you can pretend you're healed by mental faith now don't give up because that can lead you to a spiritual revelation you can pretend or act like you're saved you can pretend you're saved but you're not saved by mental faith has God and accepted you amen well I said to Jesus Christ I've done all I can do but has he come and accepted you but you understand my point it's easy to believe in healing if you pray one prayer and you see it done it would have been easy for Abraham to really be a good believer if a day that he heard from God the baby come now may I quote the prophet he said it's a whole lot greater for you to have to take the word of God and stand on that word of God and wait on God to fulfill that then it is an instant miracle healing you remember that oh yeah pray for somebody instantly Glory Hallelujah well I believe in that now don't we sing God do it right but the greater faith the greater point is to just take God's word and stand right there when everything is opposition against you even the preachers against you he's trying to explain it some way and God doesn't spoke to you when it is and you know the worst thing to do it he's just about talk you out of it I remember brother Moe talking about one time I can't remember what it was but that he saw it before he ever heard of the message you know it was in the Bible just use an example that he saw serpent seed or something and he said you know what I said I went to church and they talked me out of that well that's pretty well what's taking place right with a mental faith the disciples three years and a half they saw the Miracles they saw the signs they saw the healings the Wonders the dead rays you know what never converted to one of them come on never one of them got converted and to prove it that they didn't they ever wanted run from him when he come to the last moment even though Jesus would say it do you now believe yeah were they where were they when he was crucified the closest one that we can know of was John at least John goes in and says let me out of the body right Peter and the rest of them running like crazy at least John did want to request for the body well yet none of them and anything that could walk on and you know Peter had had a substance under his feet he knew a little bit about it and he knew that he was not the place that he had a substance because he knew if he walked out that door death was waiting on him but when he received what got him in the boat now you understand what I mean what brought him in the boat and saved him when he seen that come to pass on the day of Pentecost into his soul he said hey let's go outside come on boys no more fear right he wasn't stupid but there was no Warfare because he had something tangible I've asked you the question and I'll keep asking it have you ever had anything happen if God showed you spoke to you revealed to you or whatever you want to call it that something was going to be that way and you see it come to pass have you ever been healed I'm not talking about waiting and doing but if you ever just come to a point that something that said you're healed and you may have to wait for months for it to come into reality oh yeah when it becomes a substance I'll say I'm Healed now that ain't Bible you are a liar amen if we say it that way we're a liar the Bible says to confess and you must confess before you receive and it must come by a mental concept mental I hope people understand my language I'm sorry croaky throat and bad words but mental mental faith is pretty close the disciples had ever right to get up and walk out of the upper room as I said a moment ago they've seen the sick he got a dead race in their own ministry right right and they could have walked out there with a pretty good mental concept we should see somebody said hold on maybe it was Peter and it said I walked on the water boys and he brought me back in the boat and I don't have under my feet I don't have that assurance that I had when I walked that day so I'm going to wait anybody in the Bible had ever amounted to anything at a personal revelation with God dog and want to go with somebody you've heard this over and over Moses at the burning bush God said I'm the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob he said wonderful I believe it I believe God you're the god of Abraham Isaac Jacob but I'm not going to Egypt oh yeah he said give me something that's personal to me right he said I am that I am Moses said let's go to Egypt right he had something related to him when he got to Egypt what did he say he told them the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob sent him down they said who is he he said I am that was pretty close right you know to pharaoh it looked pretty close for him not to explain the great Revelation and just say I am they're going to take him out of here he said I am that's pretty close Moses you're gonna take him out he said the one that met me told me to say this and he said what I'm saying well you know what one day he walked out something personal it had ever been revealed to you that there's one God or is it what brother random talk you asked the biggest force of the preacher is this message they can't preach without quotes they can't preach the scriptures and show it in the scriptures they gotta have a quote well you know how much I quote so you know I'm not against quote so don't be stupid all right the biggest force in what I'm doing a lot of time you don't know what it's laying right here I'm quoting brother Branham the only way you're going to know that if you're in the message right okay watch now you remember what we went through that even a psychic with mental power could break lives a magician but around said a cheap trick pull pranks on people break lives what about a man walking on colds of Fire and it's not burning him pretty good mental power because I'm not going to try it you say well you wouldn't do it I didn't say I wouldn't do it I said I'm not going to try it when I walk across there you better blank a bank on one thing God told me to do it all right then I'm going to ask him for a second opinion but not the Holy Ghost to the father or whatever to get to you know what I mean I'm just honest and you need to be too yeah because if he tells me to walk out there I ain't worried about it he'll provide the way amen but until he tells me I'm not going to walk out to her because I know a mental Faith what about brother random even using that as I said to about the little girl that the bracelet was hanging in the room now remember what he said he said we didn't have time for her to get to a doctor said we had to have something immediately she didn't have time to set two weeks and confessions healed he said make that bracelet swing around around stop it and make it do things one message he said she said that ain't nothing but psychics or he said I knew you'd say that but he turned and he said she said can you do it well you know what he was a prophet when a prophet's put on the spot he didn't like me and you now you go home and you hang up a bracelet and you stare at it well you better remember one thing if you get it to move you better say it was God now if you don't you're going to get the mental attitude that you something right and now time to wait and it moved around and stopped and she caught it and was healed right but we're going to get down to a little closer point because that was a mental part talking about oh with no time or whatsoever I mean one of these days we're going to get on to faith being a substance it's a whole lot different attitude when he made a statement one day remember the chief magician could swing it around and do the break of glass but let's see that Chief magician do what he said he said I forgot my knife it's laying over on the dresser he said but if I believe it it'll be in my pocket he said now that stumped you and I admit that stumped me do you admit it's not you but if it happens see then you can go back and anchor to that and see it because it's a substance all right we don't want to get onto that we want to we want to stay on the point of understanding one thing the right mental attitude toward any promise of God we'll bring it to Pious now what's the right mental attitude what's the right mental attitude go ahead to number one on the who takes I want you to just read something with me that a prophet had to say he's talking about a right mental attitude and I read this one I liked I thought that's exactly right but I ain't never heard it like that look what he said he's talking about healing principles of healing and look what he says because that's the message principles Divine Healing preached in 1951 923 30. now the first thing a person does when you get sick maybe around home you have a few remedies and things you try right I mean you get a bad cough you take a cough drop you take off syrup those are the right men latitude but what we think the right mental attitude I'm not coughing I'm not coughing we think that's the way we talk ourselves into faith now he's explaining simple mental Faith a sense of sensible way try a few remedies no bless God I'm going straight to God with it well okay amen but don't blame me because I take a cough drop right what he said maybe around home you have a few remedies and things you try the next thing is is maybe you call the doctor that's a sensible thing to do call the doctor all right now there's another quote that you can read that they used to use us a lot down in a certain church we were that and because brother random made a statement one day and I can give you the quote if you'd like it he said you don't have no right to go before God till you go to the doctor first and you could go out to be prayed for literally I've heard the preacher say you go doctor first I ain't praying for you supposed to go to doctor first now you showed me that and brother Brown's message what he done now you'd have to stop every prayer line it ever was so you know that's not what he's saying right the first thing is to be sensible go to the doctor yeah but if I go to the doctor it means I ain't got no faith what I care what the doctor says is your faith based on what he says purple What God Says all right first thing take a few remedies second thing go to the doctor be sensible huh what about a a great person who was the height of all as we would call it the apex of the healing Ministries but yeah he's telling you go to the doctor met a person one day and they said something do you remember the quote and he said now there's an old doctor right down here said you got stomach trouble said there's an old doctor right down here specializing that kind of operation so go down there and let them operate on you a prophet well now you can prop that up by saying well now he could look down and see they didn't have no faith and they didn't have no this well so what he told him to go to the doctor well they didn't slap him a couple of times and say hold on a minute go to the doctor now we're going to get down to the rest of it right and if the doctor can't do you no good no then you got a right to go to God that's what you should do call on God and God is the author of circumstances he can do when nothing else can do when man comes to the end of their line God can do but don't worry about going to the doctor do we but I know people in this message that don't want to go to the doctor because they're afraid to lose their faith well come on I'm dumb stupid and hard-headed and I speak hard but if you're not going to take medicine don't take no medicine don't take no home remedies don't take nothing you make up because that's where they got their medicine from you know that Edgar Casey a psychic a lot of the medicine we probably take today was remedies that Edgar case if you've ever read a story of his life people would go to him and tell him what's wrong with him he'd tell them what medicine to go make up you know a lot of that is what you take today and really I'd rather had his psychic ability than all the medical doctors and what they could pump up and pride up you know because at least out of contact what call on God what's he saying humanly speaking what's brought around him saying we're human beings you hurt take an aspirin but see that's the way people are I ain't taking no medicine you let them get in a serious condition and you'll find out their faith begins to dwindle just away and they'll say well give me an aspirin well if you ain't going to take nothing else don't take the aspirin right if you ain't gonna do not don't eat no pokes at it that's an old home remedy of a purity for the blood green beans is a green that's a purity for your blood don't eat no green beans you see where we make ourselves to be stupid or so revelated that's what I'm getting at trying to get you to see what faith really is mental faith is a wonderful thing by mental Faith you was able to ride to church today and didn't have to walk by mental Faith you're sitting in an air-conditioned building that some of these wrapped up and some of his Fanning we can't get that together right mental faith has made us with great ability mental Faith it's strong the disciples all they had until Jesus died and gave them the Holy Ghost was mental faith you have to sing the dead race to seek healed and all in their Ministry mental faith and the prophet said the biggest Fortune of our faith is mental faith no brother Dale I got a holy ghost faith and I come to this message I saw that one true and living God and I saw it and I believe it because it's just one God they can't be no other way I believe it I swear by it and then some preacher comes along tells you that Jesus wouldn't God to the river of Jordan and he become God then God left him and he died hey Glory I believe that now you don't believe in one God you don't lost your own God faith you don't lost any substance you thought you had right come on that's why I'm so hard I'm sorry but I try to protect you from doctrines if there's two Souls there got to be two gods if there's two Lords they gotta be two gods that's why I'm so hard against those type of things we call it faith revelation show me where the disciples taught anything like that you don't never hear these people preach out of the Bible a too low or two Soul or right come on folks look notice and never forget this you people laying here sick and needy the right mental attitude toward any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass watch When You Believe and take God at his word say it so believe it so God will bring it to five right mental attitude towards any Divine promise that God will bring it to Pious if you're a sinner confess your sins write mental attitude believe that God saved you and then go testifying of it telling people that you're saved it'll work righteousness after a while you'll be a Christian I love that after a while great group of people over the book of Acts Paul said have you received the gift of the Holy Ghost since you believed great Believers right but they haven't got the Holy Ghost yet they had a mental Faith a truth come on it's like I was telling somebody want to go and I told you and you know it I believe this Bible I believe brother Brown's message is thus saith the Lord now a lot of things run around and said as a human being is a human being that was his thoughts or or something when he said they'll fight again and die like flies the Black Water the next message he said that was my thoughts but yet we want to make a a point out of it you don't believe it you don't believe what he said well it's like I told one brother I said brother would you mind you say quote brother random say what brother random said I handed him a book I said would you read that he looked down at it and he said I ain't reading it you know what brother Brown said and give you a direct quote where he said Luther denominator maybe not the word denominator but he said he died and went to hell you denominated Luther never denominated what's he talking about he said we'll show you what the prophet said all right I'll give you quote you won't to in the message by mental concept I can almost find you a quote seemingly contrary to it but also with the Bible give me a direct quote of a scripture and I by memory will be able to almost to give you something seemingly contrary but now we know it can't be true that's why I said the message is Right amen the prophet said things that was a human being when Elisha back there cursed those children that was not the Holy Ghost God didn't tell him to do that it was the power it was invested within him as being a prophet you don't hear Brother random calling down fire right because he had the Holy Ghost in here a lot of difference in pot and look around in Elisha Elisha was a man but man was a man but this man had the Holy Ghost about it that's why he was given more gifts than anybody all right but are you listening after a while you'll be a Christian amen confess yourself into it yes now come on am I right when you make a confession the devil appears right right he'll come running huh not a while he said well I don't know where I believe that or not he's done got you at least keep saying boo you know confession confession until he gets mad at you and run off leave you amen you see you're gonna have something when you do that all right mental attitude toward any Divine promise in the Bible will bring it to pass the Divine promise is written in the Bible and it'll bring it to pies now just keep that on your mind are you looking at it just keep that on your mind say I'm Healed say I'm saved well I don't want to lie when I ain't saved go ahead you're already a liar you're a liar if you say you're not saved because the Bible says you are let me say what he says right right we want super duper super revelation I like this one I'll get this one real quick look what he said on Thursday we would see Jesus 1960 E10 now may I may I go on record just now saying this that I believe the right mental attitude toward any Divine promise of God will bring to pass if you can take the right mental attitude toward that promise and we stopped our first on that if you can take the right mental attitude what is Right mental attitude what is the right mental attitude what would be the right mental attitude if you were going to try to break lives I have the ability to do it because I've done it before right and I'm not afraid to put it on the spell right you remember brother Branham going to the meeting that time and there there was this piano or table or something was just floating around in the room I don't believe that you have an integral flow he did but you remember what he done he said let me try something now if I miss quote this you put it where it's supposed to be he said in the name of the Rose of Sharon and Lily divided right morning star fall down he said it just stayed up in the name of the father son the Holy Ghost he just stayed up didn't fall let me try one more time he said in the name of Jesus Christ down it went but the part of it is we are so dumb until we don't believe the piano could be floated by psychic power oh right right when honors don't you go argue with him he was one that said he's up in the air he's the one that said what happened about it he said I've seen witch doctors in blood right drink blood out of a human skull and rot in unknown tongues and interpret that you see if we've never experienced anything we don't believe it now how many of you I'm not going to ask a question for a point but how many of you Brothers in here ever got drunk enough to see a pink elephant now maybe you saw something else but you know what I'm talking about you know what that's real to you you run all over somebody with a knife to get away from that pink elephant but anybody else standing around I can't see the pink elephant but you're gonna tell him he can't see it see that's where we we are so super duper revelated until we don't believe in simplicity do you honestly believe that a man can walk across colds of fire and it not burning now I've never seen it done I ain't worried about it but do you believe it can be done do you believe that you can leave a tight you know raise up do Benny Hinn walked off the platform out in mid-air well that was fake well what's your super duper got doing with it if that's Faith show me the right but you understand see we think that we have such a great Revelation or thoughts but don't think about a God that allows these things I'll get back this evening to it what about where it says canker warm front worm Locus caterpillar and the Bible says my great Army that I sin among you and we know he didn't send it like make it come like produce it that way he allowed it to come right why to try you and run around and said just right God of this evil age I'm pretty sure I've got it in the nose he said this bride is to prove to Satan she won't fall like Eve for us to make light or do a snake Handler a person who drinks poison and it don't kill them why don't you do it oh I'm smarter no you're scared why don't you admit you're scared but now what's going to happen the day comes if they come walking in here with a snake the building to be cleared probably pretty quick it probably makes some extra exit doors made in the wall right no joke true but what am I going to do because if I back down I'll prove I ain't got what I'm talking about and I have no right to talk to you about something I don't have I don't talk to you about something that I haven't experienced I've seen the dead Rays I've seen the sick healed I've seen things happen at the word I've seen things that most people have never seen but I'm an exalted intellectual something for telling you about it but I thought he's supposed to be the same for all of us look what he says if you take the right mental attitude toward the promise God said it I believe it now let's take what he said for the promise is a seed right are you reading a seed goes into the ground and if it's a germatized seed got the life in it and bring forth its kind if it's put in the proper place if a seed is put into the ground promise of God is a seed can we believe it he's promised us these things can we believe it no because it he doesn't do it when we want it done that's what I was trying to explain while ago we lose our point when he doesn't do what we want him to do or at the time that it's done see then we don't look at other things and you know what we just wind up being unbelievers I'm not going to say that to Pope lay his hands on the sick and then be healed I'm not going to say that's not right I'm just going to say one thing whether he done it or you done it or brother Branham done it or Jesus done it God's A Healer that's my whole point right God's the Healer if the Beatles could sing a song and you could be healed The Beatles ain't the Healer but now you know what happened with The Beatles in the basis of them people getting up and walking that was paralyzed because they touched a mental Faith within that person that person lost control of their mentality in the bases that they went beyond their mental thoughts that they couldn't walk and they got up and walked yeah not necessarily they were healed but yet we can call it healing because they did walk when they couldn't walk before but it was a mental concept at least church we could have that much and then we wouldn't be as brother four and he said wowzy wowzy Woo you know I remember the boy ain't sick like I am you had what I had you wouldn't be bragging what are you doing wishing it on me are you trying to scare me with it remember fear is the worst thing in the world when that doctor walked in there and told me he said you've got leukemia Sam I looked back at him and I said no problem no chemo I said I'll do anything else you tell me but you're not going to give me any chemo treatments I said because what's the difference in me living three months or living six months I said you were and this is what I told him I said you're on that side of the table you're giving out the stuff I'm on this side of the table burying the people that's what I told him I said there won't be nothing he said it's not like it used to be Sam with the chemos and the all the different things I said I don't have any problems with you and I don't teach my people not to take it but I said you're not going to give it to me I went over to the other cancer specialist when he walked in he said Sam you know you got leukemia I said great you know what I told the other doctor no chemo he said but I got another thing to tell you you've got a different kind of leukemia you got one that's not going to kill you did you go out one is you gonna die with it instead of die of it because there's two leukemias I want to kill you that's it but we've seen one that had to get a little picture right up here this little kid was determined as to having the horrible leukemia she's still alive today is she married now you know we got some more pictures nursing college miracle we're not saying Lula prayed to Pryor somebody did oh but it was my prayer well then I can say real quick if I say things like that I know it wouldn't my prayer because I'm trying to build up the thing brother Al come out there Sunday and he knows it he walked by and he said just lay your hand right there he said just lay your hand right there it'll be all right I just laid my hand right there didn't pray didn't do nothing just laid my hand there but he needed more I could have said Al you're healed us that and the other but he needed more so we come Wednesday night and he couldn't move his arm up right when Wade started preaching somehow that's the word doing the healing and he raised his arm y'all didn't hear me right there I said God I know what that is if you listen to the tape you could hear it I know what he done when he raised his hand why did it matter who prayed it's the god that done it not me and you you know but I want to get credit for what I do then you didn't do nothing any problems with that because God is the Healer see that's wanting to be praised wanting to be done and I stood right here and looked back and and brother Anderson sister Anderson wanted us to pray and we prayed about them having a baby I knew they was going to have a baby it was already settled right here but how could I get that to them so what I do I pray God get what's in me that I believe into them brother Forney come up here preaching I never said a word to it we had talked we you know they had talked about needing a family or wanting a family to all around no brother Forney just went walking right down through there and he just walked right up and he said God's going to give you that job well you know what praise God it took them believing brother for CE but I'd already seen it happen I try I'll give you a little secret if you'll listen and you asked me to pray for you if I stuttered Stoner and say we'll pray about it then I'm believing with you but if I ever look at you and say you are healed then that's not me if you believe it because I'm saying what he says see faith is a whole lot different than what we think what did you see of issues did you see that no no I just take him in his word when he told me to take my kneecap off I said you ain't taking my kneecap off I still got him oh man you're a while back I started hurting the devil said see how you're gonna have took off I just laugh like everything I said buddy you 30 years behind I'm 70 years old the ought to be took off by now you know what he left why don't you say What God Says sometimes and watch that devil just get away say it when everybody else is against you say it when you're the only one that can believe it because you're the only one that's revealed to mental faith can become a spiritual revelation I'm not talking about something that now listen to what my wording I'll finish it with this we'll burn around and taught us here we read it that's fine but there was healing in the Methodist healing in the Baptist healing in the Pentecostal right some of you come through Pentecostal churches somebody told me one time about going to a person's house and that is left and went down in the woods and come back and said everything's all right I believe that I believe God is real amen I believe he's running with her today to heal them and save them because he's God see we're limited even though they're not in the message you mean there's nothing but a god of the message where's the foolish virgin coming from musician think on these things mental faith mental faith did you say What God Says it's just confess the way God said it huh little note says it's the cake for Nanny between the services okay all right between the services don't go get it now let's stand and think about it if our mental faith if we don't have that first we don't have anything it's got to be mental faith right but then it's got to become a spiritual revelation of substance what do we think about it all right okay testimony one of your order or somewhere where you can be in here pray pray with me that I get through what I want to say I was battling this morning in my mind and Sunday School and here when I first got in here and I had such a foggy headache I went to a funeral yesterday was a girlfriend's mother I'm waiting on the phone call from back home my second mom my sister Gibby felt something and she wrote me a note and told me that she loved me I reached over and I took her hand to thank her in such a peace and a calm just engulfed me right then and I'm sharing this because the Lord pays attention to the littlest details in our lives thank you for listening he pays attention to the small he doesn't but he died go ahead six to one six you might have a name well I'm saying but just a verse and then we got to go all right Jesus is sisters all of you that can get out and come up here our sister's got a problem but you know what a lot of times our problems is we think we're by herself we think we're the only one going through anything or you know nobody's having problems we got them all but everybody's got problems everybody's got troubles and everybody is faced problems and troubles you need something that you can see something that you can see yourself and realize that you're not by yourself see we can pray to cast something off and we believe in that but you know what the greatest ability to conquer an enemy is love prior is one thing and we believe in it we're going to pray but love is the greatest conquering enemy that the devil has got I mean it conquers him it's the love of mine run around and said I'd rather see love in a church than to see 5 000 people healed thank you and on oh Lord what what are you saying he said because if Love Comes we're going to see 10 000 heal I thought love the greatest Force could ever be is the love of God it'll conquer all enemies for you don't worry you see the love that people have you're not alone don't ever think you're by yourself and no just remember everybody's praying for you and the love of God is going to move into our sister's life to pray for and believe we're going to an owner with what we're going to pray for her because that's what the Bible says right exactly I want you to take this and I want you to put it on you these sisters will tell you you know keep that with you and believe that everybody here is praying over that Little Falls and that's what it means that needs everybody here is one mind and we're believing it and we're going to ask God to cast that demon away from you because it's not you it's not you hold on sickness is not a person is what Satan brings on to us and we're not against you that's the point that we understand but let's believe father in the name of Jesus Christ we lay our hands upon our sister believing with all of these sisters that are standing around to show their love their concern and their thoughts for our sisters let her know that she's not by herself let her know that she has a group of sisters it's all in harmony with her in the love of Jesus Christ father let her know that God is real in leading into all things these sisters are joined together and that's the one thing you cannot handle is the love it would even be in the natural in the name of Jesus Christ we condemn you Satan you just might as well move on because God is real we love you in Jesus name amen do you believe it you believe it then you just believe it love is the greatest conqueror of Satan that could be let that love just Bond you and see if not that God is a deliverer he's a Healer what he did he does it when the way he wants to I shall not be enough to Satan love is an enemy to say he can't stand love you don't understand you can't comprehend it's like I told her sister last night I said you'll find one thing about us that you don't find among other churches so you go about among the churches they're going to start talking about all of the what's this what isn't they're going to condemn you when they said none of us are going to condemn you we're going to pray for you and we're going to believe because it is the word of God father in the name of Jesus Christ we thank you and We Praise Your Great Name and your honor your glory thank you for the testimonies that we have Lord today that we've heard from you and thank you for your word and we pray that you would just bless thank you for all the sisters for being concerned to come and stand around our sister to agree with her we believe you Lord That You Are the Healer you're the deliverer and you will take care of all things God is already finished we believe you we love you and we thank you go with us now as we go eat natural meals and bring us back together this evening we love you we thank you in Jesus name you dismissed play and the things other sorry
