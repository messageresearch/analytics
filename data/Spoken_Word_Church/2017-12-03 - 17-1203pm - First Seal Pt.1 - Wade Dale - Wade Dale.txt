Description:
1) 63-0318  THE.FIRST.SEAL_  JEFFERSONVILLE.IN  MONDAY_
And at the end of the Pentecostal age we are supposed to receive, according to the Word, as God help me tonight to show you through here, that we are to see--receive a messenger that will take all those loose ends out there and reveal the whole secret of God for the rapturing of the Church.
«  75       †        And then there's coming forth seven mysterious thunders that's not even written at all. That's right. And I believe that through those seven thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the Bride together for rapturing faith; because what we got right now, we--we wouldn't be able to do it. There's something we've got to step farther; we--we can't have enough faith for Divine healing hardly. We've got to have enough faith to be changed in a moment and be swept up out of this earth, and we'll find that after a while, the Lord willing, find where it's written.
«  76       †        Then all the judgments of these evil doers... Now, see, down through the ages as these Seals has been breaking, until now the last Seal is broken. And now, as they--as they have been watching in on these Seals and just presu--presuming what they were doing, now at the end of the ages, of the church ages, all these evil doers will--will take place and head up in the tribulation.
All of these evil doers of the Seven Seals has been working mysterious in the church, and we'll find out in a minute, they even work in the name of a church. They call themselves the church. You just see if that isn't right. No wonder I have been so against denomination, not knowing why. See, see?
They end up... Now, it starts back here in a mild form, just keeps getting worse and worse, on down until... And people go right into it, saying, "Oh, yes, this is just fine." But in the last days these things are made known. And they finally go so bad until they go plumb into the tribulation period.

ticket expenses you talking about all the spending is what he does that we paid but for him only not for the wife now so what we're gonna do is give brother Louie's money today far Lisa's instructed to find out what the ticket cost would be for the expenses of the tickets over to where he's going not for her now cause make that plane see some people don't hear the second time you say things they

the bibles to revelations chapter 6 and we're going to start now this is going to be first seal part 1 we're not going to get the the board out today because I kind of picked up another thought last night on some things that we were talking about and what brother Dale and I were talking about this morning and I kind of want to get that out of the way before we start into the symbols because remember when we read this revelation 6:1 that that was a that was a scene that happened in front of John right it was a scene that happened in front of John because physically you're never gonna see a man on a white horse with a bow and a crown you know you're not gonna see a physical happening of that so it's a parable and actor it's symbols so I said he was John was commissioned to write what he saw well when when the angel said come and see john wrote 'we saw he saw a wild horse rider and he saw sitting on that horse it was a man sitting on the horse and he had a bow and he was given a crown we've been through that before that powell was given this whoever this person is has no power to start with if will realize that we won't have to preach these seals too much hey ma'am he didn't have any power he had to get on a horse right he was given power to do these things all right so they like brother Gary action says who gives them the power to do it we do we're the ones that giving the power I I want to kind of cover something in in Genesis because remember brother Brown said one seal tile the entire Bible together right cuz it's the book of redemption and that's what we're going to talk about remember all that background that we can went through several months ago of a foundation of for the seals all the seals together is one great revelation of who Jesus Christ not the devil now he's to be exposed or he's to be revealed now we're gonna read that in Thessalonians where he will be revealed but in his in his being made known of the devil what it does to me is is it puts him over here so that we can notice what he's doing because remember most people that are deceived and were reading in Thessalonians the devil is not out there he resides he resides and he listened in our spirit realm he resides a lot in ours so don't get so don't get so high in pious that we're talking about the denominational world no he he works he works in my members about as much as God does and I'll they say it works more than God does right ma'am right because we live a we live a common human life and and before the fall oh we get into its revelation 6 first one you just pray for us that I'm going to take my time and and next Sunday we'll probably use the use the board when we go because the last thing I want to talk about is the symbols because what we're talking about to downstairs is you got to remember that that the seals were written or preached in Matthew 24 by the Lord Jesus himself so it's not something new it's not something that's not written that's why I want us to see that that the seal is written the thunders what was the unwritten part but yet it has to compare with every scripture in the Bible okay so we're gonna worry about the seal right here first we got to get the seal off so that we can see what's on the inside right okay so we gotta get the seal off first and that's what the prophets job was was to take that seal off hey man cuz it was sealed up and we'll talk about that in a minute so let's read revelation 6 first one not keep you standing let's go to ward and prayer the only father we pray Lord that you be the active participant Lord again in this service father we truly do we have a common life that's controlled a lot of times by by factors of of life and things that we live but you know that didn't bother you when you came down in human flesh you sure you had to eat you had to sleep all those different things but you had no guilty conscience because you knew who you was father I pray that our conscience will be that will be clean Lord and we'll read some of that maybe later on about condemnation Lord that the seal shows us I believe that there is no condemnation to the bride of Jesus Christ father we ask you to forgive us of our sins bless this day Lord be with the ones that are traveling brother Joe brother Bob out preaching for the brother there in Lawrenceville order I pray this you just touch them and give them strength forgive us of our sins bless this day and take care of us anoint us for the job all of us have a job to do Lord not just the anointing up here but Lord made or that everyone brought their little lick of fire and Lord maybe we put them together and there'll be one great big flame father we pray this you just touch us now be with us in this journey take care of us in this time of the year Lord where it's hustle and bustle and people running to and fro and Lord just settle us down for a few few hours here on Sunday and winds then let us hear from you Lord because truly you did come here for a purpose you didn't just you've done just one wasn't born a baby so we could give Christmas gifts you were born to give the greatest gift and that was a way back to the eternal life that we inherited before the foundation of the world probably give us this day our daily bread in Jesus name we pray amen that's what I think about Christmas I love Christmastime I love give gifts but the greatest gift was that that God came himself to get us to make us a way back you know he didn't come to bring us inheritance like we were brother bands he didn't come to bring us our inheritance he came to make us a way to get back to it our inheritance was the eternal life before the foundation of the world amen the revelation six first one and I want to tell you something about that remember on these seals remember and we'll get into in just a minute but I want to put this point in for you to think about it these seals are the most important thing we'll every ever ever have to contend with in this hour you hear what I said in this hour because everybody from Paul Paul I'm sure he probably spoke a few times on Revelation chapter 6 maybe I probably are probably not John John wrote it after probably Paul was dead so but Paul had a revelation because the seals are in the Old Testament because if it'll tie Evert infants however scripture together then you can go back to genesis exodus leviticus and all those and bring the seals which we may do later on but Paul never come under this part of having to take a body change Iranians never comin all the way down even even the Pentecostal age that we come out of but we need that so so don't think that I'm saying that this this and I'll get into in a minute it's something to that that I really I'm going bear heavy on the breaking of the seals is really not for your soul Paul was born again without knowing the seals I read in she was born again without knowing the seal everybody everybody from Paul to to even today that hadn't heard it you're born again by the shed blood of Jesus Christ that's in your soul these seals are a move-up and we'll read it in just a minute where brother when I'm comfort on the first hitter so move up its to move up to get that spirit realm in line with that soul to get the body change and man so this that's why brother Brown said it was the most one of the most important and the most spiritual realm he'd ever worked in why because it was aligning us to where we can take a body change alright and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard it was the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and I saw him behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing now remember - we're talking about in the beginning God created man what in his own image now what is in a mirror image you got an image and then you got the real person thinking buddy appreciate you got the image and you've got the real thing because what's inside that mirror is not real it's an image of what is real alright so when we take these seals and we divide them up you're gonna see a reality here which is God and Satan is just an imposter he's trying to be an image I read it in Thessalonians he wants to be asked God he can't be he wants to be God but he can't be God he can't imitate everything except being that person of God Almighty he can't be that person but now you say well what about us well God I believes made a way if Jesus Christ if we're heirs and joint heirs with Christ I keep harping on that revelations eight we got to believe what the Bible says if we're heirs and joint heirs with Christ if he is standing we're in another dimension with a redeemed body that's what we get that's what we get we get the same thing not something lesser the same the same identical thing brother Nick likes the scripture if the same spirit that raised up Christ from the dead dwells in you so it can it'll quicken your mortal body about that spirit that dwells in you Matthew 24 verse 4 let's read this just get some of these scriptures out of the way it's not gonna be long today we've got communion this afternoon so we're going to got everything ready so we're gonna take communion after we get finished for this man Matthew 24 says and jesus answered and said unto them now this is where brother Branham picks up where they asked him you know the three questions in Matthew 24 verse 4 the prophet of God brings this in as the seals I believe it in the sixth seal he God reveals him that reveals the seals to that Jesus had already preached him alright but they will remember he what's he done he says look take heed that no man deceive you take heed in other words come and see notice take heed what's happening because we're gonna read Thessalonians and we're gonna read it kind of slow I've never seen some of this till I you know sometimes we read scripture we read script and we just read right through it and then if you go back and then you take every word or every even just a phrase and that phrase will tie things together that you've never seen before yet you've read second Thessalonians and you've read second Thessalonians and you've read second Thessalonians and brother Dale gets up and preached on 2nd Thessalonians and you'll go I just read that the other day and I didn't get anything why there's a seal so I'm saying about to sit there's a seal over your eyes there's something over your eyes not your eyes but your understanding that God being born-again like brother Peter told us being born again then your be what you're sealed until the day of your redemption amen but you uncie's seals have been unsealed the books been open all right so you and I ought to be able to understand and live the Bible says live by what every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God so we're gonna try to keep this not reading many quotes but trying to keep this in the Bible is that all right and Jesus because this is where brother Branham got it he got out of the Bible and jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you Michael somebody's going to all right for meaning not one or two passing by but many shall come in my name now wait a minute let's narrow this thing down the Baptist does not come in the name of Jesus Christ they come in the name of the Father in the name of the son in the name of the Holy Ghost and make this one the second person he's saying here for many shall come in my name in other words knowing who I am so I wrote down if some of you this got the notes I wrote the message because the message is the only thing that reveals the true name of God the man for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive a few it says many so many will be deceived in this first opening of the seal and we know the first seal when it's open in its entirety we see one true and living God we've already been let downstairs but we'll work our way into that all right for those of you that that was in the Sunday School class you know you some of you gonna sleep anyway so you might as well go ahead and sleep because you've already heard this but it's going to be in a little bit different form than we heard it downstairs all right so let's now turn to 2nd Thessalonians 2 I like Thessalonians it's a it's a good it's a good two two chapters to read second Thessalonians all right look now watch now listen we're going to break this down just for a minute to get us a basis of what's going on remember I want you to keep the word Redemption in your mind keep that word Redemption brother BAM said hold that word Redemption we read that not too long ago in other words hold on to that we're talking about Redemption we're going to talk about symbols and actors and what people did and what the boat stands for and what this stands for and what this stands for but you remember one thing as that is being made known or light is being shined on that it's doing something to me and you okay because look if Martin Luther see this is what I the Lord really impressed on me this like brother brems said if Martin Luther see Martin Luther the just shall live by faith he went to a pub and he drank beer he was a German Germans drink beer anyway they drink beer like we drink tea but he drank beer and smoked a pipe and talked about God well God was pleased with that revelation of that man at the time but now if you took Martin Luther though with the same Holy Ghost you got that's why I said that soul is sealed by what believing in the Lord Jesus Christ taking the word for your hour and brother Dale from that last night the new birth is not just the Holy Ghost you can be one anointed by the Holy Ghost every day and you live on your spirit and die and go to hell all right but you can never get the new birth and dying go to hell never never can you get the new birth you can never have a birth of the word that you hold onto and it quickens that word you can never go to hell that soul is sealed in and then then all right so Martin Luther though bring Martin Luther today set him in the pew he'd be on the front row and I promise you hit me at church more than most of y'all well the ones I'm talking to like Terrence said the other days if we've come with somebody people having to services and now they only have one he said well we've got people here that decided that a long time ago you'll get that in a minute and those of you that are not here are gonna get it again but anyway which is true but Martin Luther look at what he would do though he would take what's already in his soul and then he would absolutely at the moment quit thinking about drinking beer at the moment quit thinking about smoking the pot at the moment he would this word would absolutely you couldn't keep him you couldn't keep him like work with what brother Brown said if Paul came back here today in other words I'm gonna paraphrase that and heard what I'm preaching not me but brother branham if Paul walked in and said him brother brother branham's meeting he'd be like a house on fire on a windy day he would have been in jail the property guard said by morning why because he would take what the things he saw in part now we see in its fullness we've got everything we need look what about Paul going to the Old Testament now what about Paul right in the 80% of the New Testament but watch if he took that and took thee took the amplified version or took the prophets message and running through his filter he can't come out with something different these seals is not something different yet it is but it's not different than what's going to come from right here not different but it is something that nobody has ever known so I guess you can consider it different all right I to most is unusual that's the difference in you unusual and and different that you be not looking a watch this is Paul now watch what he's saying that you be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor in it all together nor by letter as from us as that the day of Christ is at hand he's telling the people something's going to have to happen now we can say by revelation we can say now see if Paul would read his own writings he'd say you're here you're at that day right now Paul was looking at a day every prophecy it some of us thinking about not too long ago every prophecy is pointed but man we're making it live today we're not proper sign of something to come anymore what are we prophesied to come resurrections already in you the rapture is already in you everything's already in you and then alright that's what these sales is going to do the sales are going to make it's going to absolutely make us we got something different we got thing different that's why I said about different you said well it's differently that's different but it's not going to come from something different like a new message book or you know something brother brother ot gave me two books by man and I'm really gonna read them because it's really to me it showing how that you know brother branham said that the World Council churches are the Protestants and the Catholics now what's the only thing they differ Nelion the sacrament are the wine and the blood being blood in the body being the literal body right man this guy writes them it's a big thick book but I'm gonna read it but he's that sacra that psycho psycho system society started way back anyway we're giving it a little bit later I'm gonna bring it into into a message but it I tell you what's gonna happen it shows something that I have told y'all since I started preaching our persecution is going to come from within our persecution will never come from a Baptist or a Methodist or a Presbyterian or Pentecostal it's gonna come from somebody maybe sitting right beside you today and you know what they're not gonna be able to help some of it so that spirit entered okay but we'll get into a little bit later why we need to bring it all home that's why we need to be aware that something's happening that God's bringing something what to just a special group of people Amen now look now watch as a day of Christ as that the day of Christ is at hand in other words forget it guys the day of Christ is not at hand at that moment alright cuz you do it said don't be shaking in mind don't be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us that the day of Christ is the hand look let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come now it's going to come it's here but he's saying that day shall not come except there come a falling away first now to me it's a falling away of the word we could be sitting here today and fallen amen we're gonna be sitting right here today and be falling away amen are falling asleep like you're already starting to do falling away first I'm gonna play y'all that video they sent me a video of T DJ's and he's screaming wake up wake up he was telling the people to wake up by their sleep course they were shouting all over the place but anyway let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition all right except so now that we see that the seals are open the son of perdition is being exposed amen so so we're living this Paul wrote this never lived it you and I are living this all right that's what to me the seals to me the seals is come and see watch what's going on this thing's riding this thing's moving it's something going on all time until you get to what the Seventh Seal then there's silence no movement we'll get to that we'll get to that maybe by next Christmas let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed so he's got to be revealed he's got to be made known all right the son of perdition watch who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worshipped so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God we're right here right showing himself that He is God remember what remember you not that when I was yet with you I told you these things and look I made myself a note here somewhere and now you know what with oldest that he might be revealed in his time that's now he's pointing he knows that the mystery of iniquity doth already work but that it's going to culminate in a man one man it comes to a system but it's going to culminate in a man alright and now you know what withholdeth what all this that he might be revealed in this time watch for the mystery of iniquity that's already work only what he know brother Brown said that he see how God hides it that he to me if you go through all of the of the capital lettering and all that of the Bible that he should have been capital cuz that He is God and then but God hid it just like the mighty angel that comes down as Christ in this a little a God hides these things through a property can bring them out but then when he shows it to us it's not like well I don't know if he's right or not know you know it's exactly what this Bible say alright only he who now letteth I was telling somebody the other day we were talking about downstairs who brother Louise would talk about trials and tribulations listen God remember God never had a oops moment he never had a moment that he said I really shouldn't have done that so every move God made to you trial tribulation whatever it is it's for your perfection he can't make a mistake that's why I have to put my trust in him I make a thousand mistakes but through him I had made a one for the mystery of iniquity doth already work wants iniquity doing something you're not supposed to do you do it anyway you know what you're doing you're overriding you're overriding grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby your hearts sealed your spirits not sealed we're gonna get into that your soul the sealed your spirits not Amen so that's what got Adam and Eve into trouble Satan didn't couldn't work down in the soul my name so he knew that he could get to the spirit right because remember before before the fall Adam had no memory of sin Adam had no conscious of sin because remember memory reason conscious affection and imagination Adam didn't have any of that wrong before the fall he was in tune with God his soul and his spirit was in tune with God amen but now remember though his body was being renewed he wasn't eternal okay alright so just remember that hold that point for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he God who now letteth he's letting it happen will let until he now that he brother Brown says is the bride till he be taken out of the way do you know that Daniel seventy weeks the culmination of that is waiting on you bringing two prophets on the scene to preach the gospel is waiting on you those 144,000 are over there somewhere in the Middle East waiting on me and you to get what out of the way and then shall that because remember look Jesus preached the seal 2,000 years ago then the property guard broke them to us now we're in our feeble way trying to explain it or we're not helping the Prophet I promise you one bit we're hindering but we're what we're bringing to our back to our remembrance but those seals don't really open until the wicked one comes right we got to get out of the way right here's what he says until he the bride be taken out the way and then shall that wicked be revealed what in that last happened that last week of Daniel seventy weeks that's when he's going to be revealed say so that's when the seals are going to break he's going to get on a white righteous church remember the to pray six or the sixth seal oh you got it but we got to break them here now he's got to be broke to you doesn't matter if it's broke the brother Dale but it really does because through him since him being the pastor through him you got to get it and then because look if you look if not and here we go again then why we not took a rapture if brother Branham broke him and I'll read it I saved it for next Sunday brother Brown says when they're broke in their entirety he said in their entirety he said then what the door be closed so they were broke back then in 1963 I believe the seals broke to the profit but no one else no one else but when they're broke in their entirety that's when the lamb takes the book in step forth because remember once he takes the book he doesn't redeem anymore he's a judge and boy I tell you you talking about a message folks I'm telling you that word that brother Dale has been preaching on compassion and sympathy man talk about bringing something out more of how God works and how he deals with things man to me that was a seal that broke a man that was a seal that broke right there that was a thunder that's been what it's been are looking up condemnation and all the different things and back here and never looked up condemnation that much and then I looked up compassion and if you've got to dig in you'll see that they're the same but they're different a sympathetic guard is a grandpa a compassionate God is a judge a compassionate jart to be compassionate I mean to be sympathetic you can't be a judge because you sympathize with everything there's no judgment but a compassionate God brings the judge on the scene ma'am all right I didn't want to preach a sermon for you baby and then show that but I just it just don't those two words just two words will open when you separate them it opens up it when he does it makes me understand more because hey folks we got questions on questions on questions about what the Bible says questions about listen we're full of questions and that's alright as long as what we can strike them off and say that one's done we can strike them off and say that one's done because when we get down to our last question can I walk through that wall then I'm going to be able to walk that wall and then stuff that wicked be revealed you think it's funny one day we're gonna walk through the wall you think brother Tatum's got to open that door to walk in he's not gonna have a question either he's just gonna walk through the door not in through and then shall that wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume now when does he do that remember he does that over in the tribulation period right takes him out of the way and remember that man thrown in the lake of fire before the judgment before white throne judgment right him and the false prophet in the Beast all those remember they go in first and what shall consume with the spirit of his mouth now what's happened is we come down to now that's what's happening to you and I the only way we're getting a revelation is to hear it by somebody's speaking it with a spirit out of their mouth amen and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming now that's the coming that we're gonna we're not gonna say that's not the coming that we're talking about right this is the coming after everything's done we're already taking out the way so look let's just did use some deduction here if we're taken out of the way right here this doesn't apply to us right if we're gone but we got to get the revelation of it to get us out of the way and then shall that wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming now to you and I that is the part of we got to see as far as my body changed but remember he's gonna come as a thief in the night this is where he's gonna everybody's gonna see a man alright even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders that beast is going to speak over there when we get out of here and the only thing it's going to combat him is those two prophets right I saw the thing can stand against that man cuz he's what he's Satan incarnate now you know why he's Satan incarnate because God's incarnate incarnated in a group of people and Satan is a copycat and there's no way he can incarnate a man until God incarnates you and I a man and we get out of here alright and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not didn't that they were seat didn't see the truth that love right there is not feeling your love that's a godly love that's the headstone that unless what because they receive not the headstone of the truth that they might be what saved a man so they what they they receive a lot and they're damned by that okay let's read what brother Browns standing to watch on the first seal in 1963 and at the end of the Pentecostal age we're supposed to receive according to the word is God helped me to not to show you through here that we are to receive a message or messenger that will take all those loose ends out there and reveal the whole secret of God for the rapturing of the church look now watch and then there's coming for seven mysterious thunders that's not even written at all that's right and I believe that through these seven thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing faith then all right look what look what he says I didn't highlight these I'm sorry because what we got now we wouldn't be able to do it what we got right now Lou the church we won't be able to do it there's something we've got to step further we can't have enough faith for divine healing hardly we've got to have enough faith to be changed in a moment and be swept out up out of this earth and we'll find that after a while the Lord willing find where it's written now he said right up here wasn't written but it's written right here cuz it's written in the Bible it's the whole Bible look then all the judgments of these evildoers now watch remember the judgment of the evildoers is not watch he moves right over into when we get out of here okay cuz remember Satan's not judged today he's judged in me and you out of us but remember he's not gonna be judged for what he's doing until we get gone until we get out of here right because what then all the judgments of these evildoers now see down through the ages as the seals has been breaking see they did break in simple form down through the church ages you hear me I said symbol form down to the church ages but it wasn't broke to Paul or Irene it's of Martin yet they were included in that first seal because the first seal remember represents the first three Church ages we'll get into that a little bit later all right put as a symbol listen you and I are not symbols we're real people amen and everybody else is going on there going on all right now see down through the ages as these seals has been breaking until now the last seal is broken and now as as they have been watching in on these seals and just presume me what they were doing no doubt Clarence Larkin got a revelation but he didn't get a full revelation he didn't listen to me he didn't get a prophetic revelation because he wasn't a prophet I don't depend on what Clarence Larkin said but he did speak truth okay I don't depend on what Billy Grimm said but he did speak truth and man right but it but I depend on what the prophet of God said the essence of this message I include all 1,100 some sermons a man as they have been watching in on these seals and just presuming what they were doing because remember Clarence Larkins could say the wild horse rider was the Antichrist but he couldn't take you no further all he saw was that you got it there okay brother Martin he got that's best that that right there that right there is it's not what we need for a body change that's what we need for a body change Clarence Larkin couldn't get in this unwritten Park right he could get a revelation of the seal twice a brother branham said the seals and it's understood everything's all right there's no way no one had a revelation of those seals as if a prophet no one and then they could probe at it well I probe at it well my lord we probed and prodded and presumed all the time but jesus never we got to go back to the person Jesus never poked and prodded he said I am well I might be then you know Testament man spoke to me and just a look I don't really know he know he knew what he was talking about right why because he was a fulfillment he was a kind I'm talking to you I'm talking to you you're a fulfillment or a culmination of what I just read you in Thessalonians it brings the two together and now as they have been watching in these seals and just presuming what they were doing now at the end of the ages of the church age not the end see all these evil doers will take place and head up into what tribulation right all of these evil doers of the seven seals has been working mysterious in the church sure they're working what underneath Satan's been working underneath weaving his way through the church because a mystery of iniquity starting the first all right all these evildoers will take place and head up in the tribulation all of these evil doers of the seven seals has been working mysterious in the church and we'll find out in a minute they even work in the name of a church they call themselves the church you just see if that isn't right no wonder I have been so against denomination not knowing why see see they end up now it starts back here in a mild form we'll talk about that later saying deed doctrine all right now it starts back here in the mile floor listen all doctrines start with two people talking all doctrine started with what do you think about what brother Ram said about right and then what one personal watch say well I got the revelation and I'm gonna tell you what it is you know we've been talking about this but you got to listen to me now you know that's the way Satan is that starts back here in a mile form just keeps getting worse and worse on down until and people go right into it saying oh yes this is just fine but in the last days these things are made known and they finally go so bad until they go plumb into the tribulation period he said that twice so remember the seals break in the Tribulation Period hello we just say the physical seal the physical man is standing there with power given to him to do things amen because remember the sixth seal the two prophets are standing on earth windowsills when the sixth seal breaks right so they got to be involved in the seals because who are they opposing right the horse rider because he's riding and they oppose him that all right but remember that's to profit you say well we got to wait till the Tribulation Period for the seals to break their will no tribulation period come without us getting a rebel of those sales they won't like I just said they won't - profits come without us getting a revelation of those sales now there won't come the Antichrist in his fullness until we get out of here man he's working he's working he's not dead foes he's working he's still riding but what are we doing we're bringing him to expose him we're bringing him up so that we can look and say hey that's not what we were supposed to do we have a commission to do away with death right and who is death that white horse rider that red horse rider that black horse rider that pale horse rider that saw he's death he is dead he's dead while he's walking mmm Bible says she's dead while she's living us thinking they so the devil is - he's dead while he's walking he when he did what he did he's done right now let's read number two and then we'll try to get into a few thoughts here on what happened a little bit more in the garden now look number two first seal we're still in the first seal now the Seventh Seal and I want to tell you just one thing see where that says roll book I was reading the seal book and I read that quote it says rolled so there was a typo one way or the other I haven't listened to the sermon I'm just telling you this so if you ever want to look that up again if you look at the quote in the book it says rolled book el rol LED and when I put rolled book in the search they come up zero I said there's no way I'm looking at the quote in a sailboat but when I put book is now being released that's what come up it says roll but it's the rolled book it's not roll this we wrote the book didn't roll that's a roll of the book all right like this this is the roll all right now the Seventh Seal just wouldn't tell you that in case you want to look at that now the Seventh Seal roll book is now being released by the Lamb we approached that place tonight god help us as the seals are broken and released the mysteries of the book are revealed now you see this is a sealed book let's stop right there for a second this is a sealed book when was it sealed in the Garden of Eden right when Adam couldn't produce because remember if Adam would have produced the product he was supposed to produce we wouldn't need a seal we wouldn't need a seal because if the seals is a redemption of our body bringing us to full Redemption Adam didn't need it at the time amen so only after the fall nice thinking of the day remember I preached that sermon on two life's cuz see our first life is dead amen we're born in sin shaping iniquity but now remember that's the reverse Latin Adam came to the world with the real life that we're supposed to live and he fell to that other life that's why they call it a fall so because of that though we've got to reverse the process we got to come from the first life and go back to that life because remember Adam did not have an endemic nature until after the fall Adam Adams spirit and soul we're not warring us what I want to talk about here for a few minutes they were not beating each other up right so where was the seal where did the seals come into being in the Garden of Eden when the fall happened that brought a manifestation that without the fall we'd never seen it but without the fall that takes the title of Redeemer away the very thing I told you if I ever wanted to call up brother dink likes to call him the Creator I like to call him the Creator too but if he wasn't the Redeemer it didn't matter how much he created right it didn't matter but Redemption tells me that that creator knew we were gonna fall and what more is like we were talking about the other day what a bunch of spoiled brats if we just have every sympathy sympathy God wasn't sympathetic in the garden I'll promise you no no like I said that's a grandpa where grandpa's were sympathetic we just really have brain damage when you become a grandfather when we become a grandparent but God's not a grandma daddy he's a father he's just a man all right so let's finish this quoting and I'll then I finished my my point here in a second this is a sealed book now remember where it was sealed it was sealed when when Adam had the ability to produce us right the book was sealed right man the book was sealed and God took it and said they can't nobody see this right you said prove it to me God said Daniel seal it up until what the time of the end seal it up till the time of the end because remember it was just a temporary seal oh just a temporary seal to get us back to eternity we're not gonna need a seal once we get into eternity is gonna be back to where Adam was that to me it's just one plus one equals two hey man so the book was sealed in the Garden of Eden now what as the seals are broken and released though look the mysteries of the book of revealed now you see this is a sealed book now we believe that do we not we believe that is a sealed book now we never knowed this before but it is it's sealed with seven seals that is on the back of the book the book is sealed with seven seals all right let's keep reading if we were talking about this kind of book he's talking about I'm sure he still might like this it would be like putting a strap across it just like I said about a hand right here seven straps but it isn't that kind of a book it's a scroll and then when the scroll is unwound that's one then laying right in that scroll is number two you just keep opening but it's a mystery but look what but yet we have probed in it but remember the book is sealed and the book is a book of mystery of Revelation it is the revelation of Jesus Christ not the Antichrist it exposes him sure it reveals him to a point but how much more if we presumed then we could be wrong right presume you could be wrong but when this book is open when the seals come off of this book there's nothing wrong with this book and there's nothing wrong with what's inside of this book and I thought you and I were supposed to be inside of this book amen so we're not presuming when you're born again listen if you're presuming you're in trouble but when you know you're locked in the revelation of Jesus Christ a book of Revelation and now you don't know down through the ages man has probed and tried to get into it we all have Martin Luther probably tried his best to further his revelation but he couldn't he couldn't why because the anointing for that hour was to do what he said to do and he'd done it give it to the people one off the scene that's the pattern in every age even this age amen same way in this age you can't be any different there's no there's no God doesn't get out of that pattern he brings a message he breaking the messenger I'm he brings a messenger bring the message gives it to the people and takes the messenger off the scene all right we know down through the ages they probed at it and trying to get into that he says we all have so we've all tried to do it we've all tried to and I say I don't say we I say all of Christendom has tried to in some way get a revelation but once you start on the rock like the Baptist if they start on the wrong if you start on the wrong path you got a right to ship somewhere because if you go father son Holy Ghost father son Holy Ghost Trinitarian you're never going to get to the truth the truths back that way and they just kept walking that's why brother Brown said to people were fine it was what that denominational idea okay that denominational idea is what turn to what the deed the doctrine and all those things we'll get into a little bit later all right made myself a note around here now look won't skip revelations 5 just save time go to where it says Redemption Redemption Redemption everybody knows what revelations 5 is breaking of the seal now look I wrote myself a note Redemption Redemption Redemption so think about Redemption Redemption Redemption Redemption means that if you drop this on the floor you got to pick this back up but you can't be if it's laying right here and you throw it down and you pick it back up and putting over here that is bringing it back but it's not bringing it back to its original place so whatever we fell from it's got to come back to its original place for full Redemption all right there by ok with that so look the breaking of the seals we'll finish with this and then we'll look at the symbols a little bit and then we'll close breaking of the seals is not necessarily for the soul now when I said not necessarily unlike brother Dale when you say just that takes everything out of the way when you say the John the Baptist John a Baptist would mean there was others but John the Baptist was one so I didn't want to say that breaking of the seals is not necess it's not necessarily for the song your soul feeds off of it your soul feeds off the raking of those seals but the breaking of the seals has nothing to do your soul is redeemed by the new birth by the shed blood of Jesus Christ by believing believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved don't say believe we'll just have a sales now he'll be saying all right that's why I said many Christians many born-again believers down to those Church ages are gonna resurrect come back and glorified bodies and never heard maybe a sermon preached about the seventh seal okay but now we can't disclose that and say that it's not important because to them it wasn't but to us it is it's our Commission we have a commission we have an anointing we were coming out of mourning last night we have an anointing that goes with the new birth that we have mr. Mallen can't afford those two things remember all right but by the shed blood of Jesus Christ at Calvary we're born-again believers that seals our soul so that nothing can get in and nothing can get out amen and we feed off of the revelation of the word amen but remember our spirit as I telling them last night our soul is spinning in this direction and our body and our spirit spinning in the other direction because we lean toward that Adamic nature we all got it I wrote myself a note see the Adamic nature was not in Adams soul the Adamic nature that the scripture is talking about is the nature that we have that spirit realm of memory reason conscious affection imagination but but the breaking of the seals will bring full fellowship back into manifestation that's the way I believe it because remember before the fall Adam and Eve were one but their body and learning but forget about the body the body just moves when something inside of it tells it take when we say I was telling dad like Schneider or in the minute ago when we say the redemption of the body that means that we're supposed to to me in our brain we think about well I gotta clean this thing up it's God comes on the inside this is just a shell the only way you the way you die is let's think about this one June's momma was passing away I'm sorry a little morbid but anyway you think about it the reason her soul left her body is is it couldn't function any more like a human that's all the way it was released when your body quits functioning altogether Ruth when your body quits function your souls gotta leave so can't stay in that body right so your body's just shelled it's the shell that holds everything together and I don't mean you got I mean it holds all that fired mechanism all that stuff is going off because remember when you pass away these don't work anymore right no organs is working what's making your organs work now it's not only your body that spirit inside to use what's making it work my spirit inside to use what's making nothing work because remember even if you get your spine severed your mind is still working your brain is still working and you know what your heart still beating a lot of things work some don't work but you got to remember one thing this body then when we say the redemption of the body don't think we got to get this thing cleaned up or that we've got to get 20/20 glasses if we can't see 20/20 that's not it the redemption of the body is when all like I said when everything comes into fellowship together when the spirit and the soul starts working back together again the problem is is when Adam watch Adam had no conscious of sin he wasn't even guilty we guilt ourselves to death but before the fall Adam was so in tune with his memories and conscience affection and imagination he had no imagination what do you imagine well I imagine that's good no I imagine the words right I'm talking about us I imagine the words right no it's right memory that's what kills most of us Adam had no memory of sin he had no memory of I was afraid right his conscience never bothered him whole hallelujah that's what that's private they say that an animal can lay down and just fall asleep I think dad's got a little bit of animal in him those buddy before the lights go out he's going bye-bye but a dog goes why because they have no conscience I don't an animal doesn't have a conscience so he's not guilty but you and I are conscious memory reasoning conscious affection imagination that's the five things and that that action is not a ghave affection remember you love with your spirit the Prophet floats prophet said you love your spirit but you love God with your soul because it is God it is God because like I said before I had them Adam in his watch what happened in his even in his godlike condition when Eve did what she did laid with the Beast brought it to him Billy oh love take over no no the agape love of God took over that soul stepped out and said oh my what have we done I can't kill you Eve because you're part of me amen that wouldn't been in his spirit realm but to look memory reasoning what did Adam reason about think about this what Adam reason about he sit down and go now I'm sitting to call that a tiger cuz I think maybe God didn't want me to call it a tiger no he never had that's what it was that's what he was that's what God even God didn't God didn't say wait a minute Adam he said how is that cool when I was thinking so you and I with our stinking thinking what who do we question sure we question ourselves we question herself but we question God God why did you cuz Adam said God said Adam worked out he said I was afraid in other words it was a question can I approach this God now with what I just done see they didn't come from his soul his soul longed for God his soul was a part of God if he had if he if he had Holy Ghost in his soul if it's soul was the eternal as God is then that was God in there cuz I think you know today you know we think of all the bad things even what he did I'm be a little carnal here from it you would think I'm trying to get help us to not beat ourselves up so much because if these sales are for our redemption of the body then we got to work outside of that soul there is therefore now no condemnation who cannot believe that but we condemn ourselves but you take you take the things we do in life most of the things we do in life or contrary to God you're in your humanity in your humanity you go to work we're gonna work in the future home did I don't have to work no we have to eat and do them other things that's connected with food right that's what I'm telling you our carnal mondo tells us where we're no good because we do X Y Z a husband and wife the beds nine different beds undefiled amen it's not shameful if you do it right God give us a way to do everything right what to get to make us realize that we're not so bad but it's going to take God Almighty to tell us that it's gonna take he put it in here already he already put it in the word hey don't come from rear Dominick he don't come from our mcdonald Almanac it doesn't come from my what George Meyers I hope she I hope she is watching you need to wear some no earrings and let your hair grow out her hair shorter mine but everybody loves George Meyers why cuz she tells you a good thing sympathizer sympathy most denominations are sympathetic their sympathy you know you just come where you want to you know income now all bless your heart or know the compassion that we have is we want them all save but the compassion that we have though is is going to stand one day and judge them people because remember the compassion that God had can't be separate from the compassion you have if you're born again right that's why this wholesale thing I want you to see is it's not God up here and nuts down here and God forbid I don't want to make him a piece of paper but the position I thought Jesus cry we're heirs and joint-heirs whatever he's got we get he's standing somewhere with an eternal body and remember brother Branham said Satan tempted Jesus right never did he tempt Jesus in his body can't tempt the body body just reacts you can't tempt his soul you can't even hardly attempt his spirit but he did Satan what tempted him but remember it doesn't matter about the temptation you and I partake of it he didn't because remember before the fall there even if anything was to come up to Adam how could he handle it you understand what you get it how could even handle it he didn't know how to handling cuz he'd never handle in the Lord what am I telling you when we get into glory when we get to the future home we're not gonna have to handle situations amen when we take a body change what we gonna handle I've done told you like they tell us it's Trudy I really don't care what we're eating at the future it's a wedding supper I really don't care what we're doing in the Millennium you say you don't care no I don't because look what I got inside of me if I got it inside of me it's gonna take me there and it's gonna be what all sufficient I'm not gonna go to the Millennium and go what am I doing here why am I not all we're doing now is sharpening the edges the big thing should be taken care of all we're doing is we're sharpening the edges now remember if Adam had no conscious of sin and no guilty conscience and obviously no memory of sin until after the fall Amen so something was sealed up and I was trying to show him last night a little bit kind of what I want to you know it's talking about the the soul spending in this direction because you'll remember your spirits what's contrary to God now you were born in sin your body came from an act that should have never happened but it did and it was allowed by God but that spirit realm is where both people can work God and Satan can work right then so what happened with Adam and I'm going to try to find that quote where brother Branham said Adam was Adam was his everything got clouded after the fall cuz remember his spirit and his body worked hand-in-hand before the fall this has got a lot to do with the seals I don't know where you believe that or not but it does cuz we got to understand his soul was still you can't remember the Bible says grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby your watch sealed until the day of your Redemption so the soul is sealed you can't look you can't even when Paul said I was I'm worrying in my members it wasn't in the soul it was in his spirit realm you don't war against God in your soul unless you're what not born again there's your war but all it does is it brings that war out to that outside that middle realm of men listen please right memory region conservation imagination down on a piece of paper cuz that's your problem it's not that your body aches no that's because you got your wearing out your souls not wearing out I thought your soul was 20 years old amen so you're not hurting in your soul unless you're hurting for God but really in your soul cuz remember you got to take that soul and once it's born again you gotta you can't touch it nobody can touch it God can't even take it away from you he can't it's a free gift he's give it to you you shall receive the what gift of the Holy Ghost the problem with Adam was is somewhere in there his soul and his spirit detached somewhere it somewhere it detached and then this is this is a soul this is not the Adamic nature that we that we this is the problem over there that all right something where they don't work continuity anymore a man because once you're born again let me one more time once you're born again you've got all the fullness you're part you're not the fullness of the Godhead by that's not what I say it I said you get the fullness of God right hello you need so where's the problem it's that mental hub that's what hugging that soul let me know and saint saying no no but there's your damning nature right that's your problem listen my problem is my memory my problem is my conscience heavenly days reasoning my fashion and Lord there is no imagination in God thank God for a prophet though that could separate those and tell us there was a third out in the soul five senses in the spirit and five senses on the outside thank God but somewhere Adam became detached from that and that what that was what after the fall so what that so when Abel was born he was detached somewhat because you and I are the same way but what are we going back to though if it was pulled apart in a garden it's got to be put back together so let's don't glory in that it was pulled apart that's glory in that there was a way made back that we can get back to that continuity between getting both spinning in the same direction amen because really the sails is not to redeem this shell it's to bring everything back in harmony with God in other words to plug it back in because remember your spirit realm is not born again amen just something to think about your spirit realms not born again only your soul if you're born again if you're born again now listen if you're not then your warden and the inside guy really you're black on the inside it's just smutty devil possessed sorry no good areas to me the gray areas on the outside the memory region kind that's where the gray area is the inside you're either wider black and I'm not saying color you understand what I'm saying you're either white righteous and everything's done away with there's not one little speck somewhere God cleans that thing out and resides come on puts himself in there and then he starts working and here we go well remember Paul said I'm warring in my members he sounds playing he said I'm worrying my members why he had a memory his conscious was killing him because he had those Christians killed what in the name of the religion he thought he already had that's our problem grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you're sealed but remember that is your earnest that is your earnest until the full possession and the full possession for me and you it's not something we got to go into another dimension to get we got to get it in this dimension yes it's in this dimension we got to get this because remember when the seal is open he shows Christ it shows the head shows the head in its fullness and its completeness hey man is that Alright so it has a lot to do to see this this to me this is when brother Branham preached for what since 1933 you really started preaching from 1933 to 1963 he was warring in his members not in a soul he was born again but he was warring in that spirit realm but when God comes down and said this is what you're here for right here revelations 10 7 this is your Commission I believe he knew sister Jenny Malachi 4 was part of his commission but see I believe God had to reveal to him that revelation 10 1 through 7 was his commission amen because he's you know in Malachi 4 it doesn't say that the seventh angel is to turn the heart it just says Elijah will come and turn the hearts doesn't say this it doesn't identify him but when you get over here in revelations 10 1 through 7 it says what the seventh angel begins to sound his message the mystery of God will be finished that's the part that he had right there that's why he said they had to do two things one what turn the hearts of the children to the father's and to reveal the mysteries according to revelations 10 7 I believe he puts in that quote revelation 10 7 he's supposed to what break the mysteries to you and I so that we can get out of here and that's what we're doing now the first seal is when it's open when that first seal opens correct me if I'm wrong they all have to open they can't what I'm saying is that God can't just open one ceiling say well ain't gonna open the other one once that first seal is open it's just like it's just like what because remember in a scroll you paid attention to that right sister Jeannie and a scroll doesn't matter if it's a hundred pages they all fault they all roll up and there's one seal on it and it seals the whole thing once you pull that seal off you roll it back and there's the first page and you move that and there's the second page you don't have another seal remember there's only one seal amen the only one and you just sit there turn the pages once that book was open see he closed the book but once that book was open it's open for you and I to take what we got and head toward a buddy chain and that's what happens when this horse riders may know it's heading us in a direction Amen because remember we'll get into it next Sunday won't get booked stop breath here and get ready for communion listening what happened is we take this right here and we get a revelation listen to me that we've been worshipping Satan yes sir you either got God or the devil let's get down to brass tacks you need to got Garland devil you can't worship some little imp in-between these are God or the devil and we're now realizing some of the things that we're doing who are we giving worship to but see that first seal when it opens that wild horse rider takes off in other words he's not gonna hang around right he's not gonna hang around because there's something coming underneath there you know what when you expose somebody they don't still hang around you do they when you expose somebody they don't you know they don't know how you steal my buddy know now that you really know who I am I'm the one who's been tormenting you for the rest of for the for your hope for your almost sixty years now mark yeah I just had to bring him in right we live close to that man I think brother Graham said one time he gets his grimy fingers on us that's what he does he holds on to us brother Danny and the things we do but what does the seal do it makes us realize hey because the first Hills a mystery of iniquity iniquities no one to do right listen it's two things it's doing wrong and knowing you shouldn't do wrong or knowing you should do right and don't do it that's the biggie right there I should have done right be careful cuz you know what when that when that anytime you have a separation there's a little bit of tear there there's a little bit of there's a little bit of you know when you pull a muscle or something you know it's a little sore but you know what I want to see that rear end of that horse going in that direction because if I see the rear end of that horse going in that direction and that man's on it he's not here anymore hey man let's bow our heads to Heavenly Father we pray Lord if what we said in a feeble way has helped us to see a little more light that when these we get into the symbols and the things that that we see that you're doing any endtime Lord it they'll be more clear that that clarity will come to the message that will truly see that what we were quoting there where we're going to come back into full fellowship not when we get to the Millennium not what that would be easy that'll be easy when we get to the future home to be in complete fellowship with you but you want us to be in complete fellowship with you here here in this Satan's domain he slipped into your domain and caused this thing to happen and now Lord you're down here in Satan's Eden a bride out telling us who we are not who we're gonna be who we are and what we're doing here father ask that you just be with us take care of us be with us and firming the service lord taking communion is a wonderful thing that we can do and we practice that every month just to keep ourself fresh just to keep ourself clean and and shed all the junk that happens during the month because truly where we're prone to to Satan's using our memory and conscious all those things we're humans but Lord you give us you give us provision to handle that or we give it now all to You Father take care of us Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen let's take to me well think about that Redemption Redemption Redemption we need our spirit back in connection with that soul and God will do it because he promised he did he promises he do it Lord bless you god bless you you need this amen you enjoy the message and then there's redemption mr. brain back what you fell from well what did Adam and Eve lose it lose their soul the soul that eternal life what's your profits it blasphemous names it was the body that got lost the world that got lost it's gonna be brought back amen and amen what a wonderful day what a time to be able to say we have heard the word in our life days we've heard dword the man of sin he can't be revealed until the bride is taken out of the way then he can come forth throw them let's get out of here no it's going into the communion den and we go to John and supper being ended the devil having put into the heart Judas Iscariot Simon's son to betray him he's just knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and he was come from God and went to God he rises from suffering let aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel worried where he was excuse me I have to go to Corinthians I'm starting off backwards I turned my scriptures and then turned it backwards let's go to Corinthians who everybody wonder where I'm at I'm in Corinthians all right I've received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you and to Lord Jesus I'm not in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you that's doing remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do shew the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily she'll be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself I like that and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup he didn't eat earthen drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body but this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord I like that real good that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home did you come out together under condemnation and the rest of us said in order when I come so let's just take a few moments and just Harry one for the other brand one for the other that the Lord would take care of everything and I believe he's doing it he's promised it why don't you pray sometimes believing that God is going to fulfill his word because he said he would he's gonna keep his promise we don't have to worry about it let's just have me a few moments of silent prayer
