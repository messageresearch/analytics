[23:56] among us and thank thank you for all
[23:58] things we love you in Jesus name
[24:05] amen Revelations
[24:08] 3 14 we've been on this one for quite a
[24:12] while and unto the angel of the Church
[24:15] of the lady of candr these things sayth
[24:18] the amen the faithful and true witness
[24:20] and who is he the beginning of the
[24:22] creation of God and what did the prophet
[24:24] say about us we are the continuation of
[24:27] of that
[24:29] creation all right now then let's go
[24:31] over to
[24:33] Hebrews and we'll pick up our parts here
[24:35] to do today and we'll if we have a
[24:38] chance this afternoon we'll try to have
[24:40] the questions and answers according to
[24:42] how we move in the amount that we have
[24:46] today all right and let's go to about
[24:49] verse 32 now you can read the whole
[24:52] these are all Warriors of
[24:54] faith and all up until until until you
[24:58] get down to about the uh maybe the 35th
[25:02] verse all of this can be pertaining to
[25:04] the Old Testament Saints but if you'll
[25:06] look when you get about verse 35 it
[25:08] begins to pick up that would probably be
[25:11] into more or less down to the ages the
[25:14] Dark Ages and the times and the troubles
[25:17] and all uh because the whole thing then
[25:19] finishes in verse 2 verse 40 all right
[25:23] so remember that these are all the
[25:24] Warriors of
[25:26] faith and what shall I say for the time
[25:29] would fail me to tell of Gideon and Baro
[25:32] and of Samson and jeath and of David
[25:35] also and Samuel and of the prophets who
[25:38] through faith subdued kingdoms wrought
[25:41] righteousness obtained promises stopped
[25:43] the mouths of lions quenched the
[25:45] violence of fire escaped the edge of the
[25:48] sword out of weakness were made strong
[25:51] wax Violet in fight turned to flight the
[25:55] armies of the aliens women received
[25:58] their dead raised to life again and
[26:00] others were tortured not accepting
[26:03] Deliverance they may that they might
[26:05] obtain a better Resurrection see now
[26:07] you're coming down in through the Dark
[26:09] Ages and and getting into the New
[26:11] Testament
[26:13] right and others had trial of cruel Mo
[26:17] Kings and scoring yay moreover of bonds
[26:20] and
[26:21] imprisonment they were stoned they were
[26:23] sown aunder were tempted were slain with
[26:26] a sword they wanted to about in sheep
[26:28] skins and goat skins being destitute
[26:31] Afflicted tormented of whom the world
[26:33] was not worthy they wondered in deserts
[26:36] and in mountains and in dens and caves
[26:38] of the earth and these all have obtained
[26:41] a good report through faith now
[26:44] once received not the
[26:47] promise yeah right then he concludes it
[26:51] by saying God having provided some
[26:53] better thing for us that they without us
[26:58] should not be made perfect you may be
[27:00] seated the Lord had his Blessing to the
[27:02] reading of the word now they re the Old
[27:06] Testament
[27:07] Saints they
[27:10] said down through the the time and and
[27:13] all those Old Testament Saints had
[27:15] passed on and went
[27:17] into uh you know paradise and a place
[27:22] with a for their holding and see they
[27:25] was not made perfect
[27:28] all right then the ones down to the
[27:30] church ages because we'll cover both of
[27:31] them the Lord willing today to showing
[27:34] it that down to the church ages you've
[27:36] had the bride all the way down that
[27:39] she's had to go by the grave so she
[27:41] never came to Perfection Now That Word
[27:44] Perfect there is the same in Matthew 5
[27:47] 5:48 is that right where that it speaks
[27:50] of be there perfect it doesn't mean
[27:53] sinless life on Amen it doesn't even
[27:56] refer that in Matthew you it it's
[27:58] referring to a completion amen the word
[28:02] perfect is com is there and you
[28:05] translate it to completion all right so
[28:09] those Old Testament Saints never reached
[28:12] completion right all right they had to
[28:15] die and go by the grave all right and
[28:17] they're waiting the resurrection and
[28:20] they're not complete right all right
[28:23] that's right then your new testament
[28:26] Saints coming down see then they had to
[28:30] die and go by the grave and people are
[28:32] still dying and going by the grave
[28:34] because it's not been brought to the
[28:37] point of completion yet all right so
[28:41] then he concludes it by saying one
[28:44] thing without us they're not made
[28:47] perfect now that would be pointing
[28:51] to the end
[28:53] time all right I'll get back to it in a
[28:55] minute in the message and bring it
[28:57] through but just remember the Old
[28:59] Testament saints were under the blood of
[29:01] bulls and goats all right they never
[29:04] attained to the blood of Jesus Christ
[29:07] okay now then in doing that then see
[29:12] Paul could say they without
[29:15] us because see he was in the atonement
[29:18] the New Testament brought the atonement
[29:20] the Old Testament look forward to the
[29:24] time of the coming of the atonement but
[29:27] never a chied that place all right so
[29:30] they were never brought to their
[29:32] completeness all right so then in the
[29:34] New Testament see then you would have
[29:38] the last
[29:40] group the end time people that would be
[29:43] fulfilled into that of saying that they
[29:46] without us cannot be made perfect all
[29:49] right see then that brings it all to a
[29:51] finished product yep okay it brings it
[29:55] to a place to where that we we can see
[29:58] uh you know uh the truth of all things
[30:02] because if there's not a resurrection a
[30:04] physical Resurrection
[30:07] yet then somebody's waiting on us and
[30:11] we're the last on so that's the one
[30:12] you're waiting on all right first to be
[30:15] Li Li to be first so then you know it's
[30:18] meant for this end time people to reach
[30:21] a position to bring the Dead from the
[30:23] ground all right so then we believe that
[30:26] that they would without us cannot be
[30:28] made perfect so everything has its
[30:30] placing did you follow the Old Testament
[30:33] Saints never received their completeness
[30:37] because they were only under the blood
[30:38] of wlls and goats but we're under the
[30:40] blood of Jesus Christ but we've never
[30:43] received a body change yet all right now
[30:45] the Bible says that that and I believe
[30:48] it's Timothy the word it says that
[30:51] speaking of Jesus Christ that he's the
[30:53] only one that has reached immortality
[30:57] right
[30:58] the light which no man can approach unto
[31:01] all right now I know there's an
[31:02] arguments in the message among the
[31:05] people but I ain't going to argue with
[31:06] nobody I'm just going to leave it alone
[31:09] let them argue their yourself away and
[31:11] we're going to try to make a change of
[31:13] the body because irregardless of what
[31:15] you're going to argue about who this is
[31:17] and what that is it's going to wind up
[31:19] to the point that you've got to have
[31:21] something to come to a bodily
[31:23] Resurrection amen amen all right that's
[31:26] right see then if a bodily Resurrection
[31:28] has already come to the Old Testament
[31:31] people then they went into immortality
[31:34] in the scripture would be
[31:36] incorrect that would say that nobody's
[31:38] reached immortality but Jesus Christ
[31:40] immortality is Mortal made Eternal right
[31:43] so then Jesus Christ is the only one to
[31:45] reach to that total position yet even
[31:48] though the Old Testament Saints some of
[31:49] them
[31:51] raised but you can argue about how
[31:53] they're raised that's up to you I ain't
[31:55] going to worry about it I'm just talking
[31:56] about
[31:57] the truth that they without us cannot be
[31:59] made
[32:01] perfect they're in the grave waiting on
[32:03] you and I right all right see then on
[32:07] that basis
[32:09] then as we covered Wednesday night we
[32:13] were talking about in the the message
[32:17] that God was waiting on you and
[32:23] I you remember we gave the quotes from
[32:26] the we'll revie a few of them but you
[32:29] know the whole service Wednesday night
[32:31] was the fact that God is waiting on you
[32:33] and I right you said God waiting on us
[32:36] well that's what your Prophet said so
[32:38] you talk to him about it you know in the
[32:42] Bible would tell you that so then what
[32:44] are they waiting on what was God waiting
[32:47] on somebody to take his word right right
[32:53] he's waiting for somebody to step out
[32:55] well brother brandom has amen
[32:58] amen we believe that that's right all
[33:01] right and he can represent the whole
[33:02] bride amen we believe that that's right
[33:05] but that's why are we here 50 years
[33:07] later on that's right that's all I've
[33:09] asked y right is just why are we here 50
[33:12] years
[33:13] later you know all right you say yeah
[33:17] but this over here has got to happen
[33:18] that over there is I covered Wednesday
[33:19] night that over there can happen in a
[33:22] hurry and what we get our eyes set on
[33:24] looking at wondering if it can happened
[33:27] or has happened or what's going on then
[33:29] we can miss what's going
[33:31] on right cuz God wants
[33:35] somebody to believe him all right we
[33:38] were dealing with a couple of three or
[33:40] four messages on
[33:42] what that the prophet of God said God
[33:45] can't do
[33:47] anything until somebody believes it and
[33:51] confesses
[33:52] it now you you say well yeah God can do
[33:55] what he want to but he bound himself to
[33:58] his word right he said he wouldn't do
[34:01] nothing in on Amos 3 and 6 he said he
[34:04] wouldn't do nothing but he reveal his
[34:06] secrets to His prophets so there
[34:08] shouldn't be any worry about whether
[34:10] it's right or not of what we're saying
[34:12] amen God's waiting on you and I to
[34:15] confess it right how is salvation
[34:19] brought to pass how is healing brought
[34:20] toies according to Romans 10 what it
[34:23] says first Believe in Your Heart Right
[34:27] and confess with your
[34:29] mouth all right you do one of them
[34:32] without doing the other one you're not
[34:33] going to get
[34:35] salvation now what does confess mean it
[34:38] means to say the same
[34:40] thing all right see then if you can take
[34:43] the word of God upon your heart and
[34:47] believe it and confess it God can make
[34:50] it come to
[34:52] pass and he's waiting on somebody to do
[34:55] that so what do you say what is your
[34:59] confession you remember where we was
[35:01] reading those where brother R was saying
[35:03] Joshua what is your thought he said but
[35:05] what's your
[35:06] decision God's waiting on his bride to
[35:10] step up and believe the word of God Amen
[35:14] and confess it right well I believe it I
[35:17] believe it and I've confessed it yeah
[35:21] well how come God didn't
[35:24] save most of the people that done that
[35:29] now come on I'm not against the Baptist
[35:32] but we came through there bapst theology
[35:35] is
[35:36] what confess it and you're
[35:42] saved right I said they read that
[35:45] scripture there in Romans so much until
[35:48] I I didn't got where I didn't like
[35:51] it not not liking the scripture not
[35:54] liking the way mankind had Ed that
[35:56] scripture
[35:57] because you just come up to the altar
[35:59] you believe in your heart you confess
[36:01] with your mouth and you're saved right
[36:04] well now you got to admit one
[36:07] thing how come biggest the biggest
[36:10] portion of people who done that never
[36:12] got
[36:14] saved you don't think like that you
[36:17] don't remember where you came from and
[36:19] the churches and the ways you don't
[36:22] remember in this message and the things
[36:24] that you've seen people come up and make
[36:26] a conf passion and claiming to believe
[36:29] and get up and go right back and become
[36:32] worse than they were to start with do
[36:34] you remember that I mean you you think
[36:36] about it somebody around you you
[36:38] remember why didn't God save them if
[36:41] they done what he said so there must be
[36:44] something wrong with the believing and
[36:47] the confessing
[36:50] right amen so it's very important once
[36:52] you
[36:54] believe right right that's right and
[36:57] then it's necessary to confess that so
[37:00] if we're not believing what God
[37:04] says he doesn't have to honor it right
[37:08] but if we're believing what he says and
[37:10] confessing what he
[37:13] says which means to say the same thing
[37:15] he says that's
[37:17] right then he can come on the scene and
[37:20] save you right I'm just trying to make a
[37:23] point that's what I've tried to drive
[37:24] hard with us and we talk talk about
[37:29] salvation but see if you don't believe
[37:31] in your heart the Lord Jesus Christ has
[37:34] raised from the dead well I believe that
[37:37] but that's just saying what somebody
[37:38] else said amen that's right you're
[37:41] quoting what somebody else has said
[37:43] Until It's Made Real to you that's right
[37:46] then when it's made real to you you are
[37:48] believing it and confessing it that's
[37:50] right and there's salvation then if you
[37:53] stop
[37:55] confessing right
[37:58] right you go down the road a little
[38:00] while and you're doing pretty good but
[38:02] then all at once you start
[38:04] sliding and your confession is not the
[38:07] same as it was what
[38:12] happened right we read to you where the
[38:14] Prophet said you lose your
[38:18] confession and even Christians he said
[38:22] you remember that one that even
[38:23] Christians Born Again Believers will
[38:26] backslide right am oh brother Dale you
[38:30] believe in backsliding I believe you can
[38:33] backslide if you don't you argue with
[38:36] brother randam or the man in the Hebrew
[38:38] series went out and got drunk and God
[38:41] took him home and the prophet said God
[38:43] had to take his child home cuz he
[38:45] couldn't Mar his name see now that's up
[38:47] to you I'm just trying to make a point
[38:49] to to illustrate that God wants somebody
[38:53] to believe it and confess it am all
[38:57] right then he'll come and make it come
[39:00] to
[39:02] P but if our confession stops it must be
[39:05] something wrong
[39:09] right or are we like the Methodist now
[39:11] the Methodist believe that you're you're
[39:14] saved and lost you're saved and lost you
[39:16] you're saved and lost you just if you're
[39:18] doing pretty good you you're safe you're
[39:20] not you know that was their Doctrine
[39:23] but now we're are we good Baptist in
[39:26] that would say well I believe it and
[39:28] I've confessed it so I'm
[39:30] saved and like I've always said then if
[39:33] you notice then nobody going to hell no
[39:35] more they're going to have to do away
[39:37] with it because everybody's confessing
[39:40] it right Buddha Hindu Muslim whatever
[39:43] they want everybody in the same category
[39:45] right make a confession is all you got
[39:48] to
[39:49] do well there's truth to making a
[39:53] confession if you don't make it you
[39:55] can't be saved that's right
[39:57] but it's according to what you
[39:59] confess that's it right there
[40:02] right see then if your confession is
[40:05] what he says am he'll honor
[40:08] it but if it's not what he says he don't
[40:12] have to honor it right right right
[40:16] simple little
[40:18] Point see then what's God waiting
[40:24] on you and I to believe who we are and
[40:28] confess
[40:30] it right you and I as Born Again
[40:34] Believers Believers in the message
[40:36] following the message all of our life
[40:37] borned in the message whatever you know
[40:40] but he's still wanting us to believe it
[40:42] and confess
[40:43] it cuz if not why we've been here 50
[40:46] years that's right since the going of
[40:48] the
[40:50] Prophet well we're waiting on you
[40:51] brother Dale well I don't think that's
[40:54] totally all of it I'm sure sure you have
[40:56] been but you
[40:59] know that's all right because you can do
[41:02] without me but you can't do without him
[41:05] all right so is that the way the prophet
[41:07] said it said he can do without us but
[41:09] said we can't do without him so we got
[41:11] to make sure our confession is correct
[41:14] that's right
[41:16] right are you afraid I've got a quote L
[41:19] here where brother around said are you
[41:22] afraid to confess
[41:25] it
[41:29] now you know the story you heard it
[41:31] where the lady said I I spoke in tongues
[41:34] got saved last night but said don't tell
[41:39] nobody well now what kind of a
[41:41] confession is
[41:44] that but
[41:47] look I just pulled this one all a while
[41:49] ago because I knew I'd be using it where
[41:52] brother BR says on the message Jehovah
[41:54] Gyra said he's making intercession Upon
[41:57] Our
[41:59] profession God can do nothing for you
[42:02] until first by faith you accept it and
[42:05] believe it and confess it right amen
[42:08] that's the way God can act now is when
[42:12] you act first that's
[42:15] right right when you act
[42:20] first okay why because he's the high
[42:23] priest making intercession on your
[42:27] confession of your faith in his finished
[42:29] work amen
[42:33] right making a
[42:36] confession Queen of Sheba he says and
[42:40] confess
[42:41] it for God can do nothing until first
[42:45] you confess it that's right the Bible in
[42:49] Hebrews three said he's the high priest
[42:51] of our confession he says now profess
[42:54] and confess is is the same
[42:57] word he can do nothing till first you
[43:01] confess that he's did it and accept it
[43:04] as your personal
[43:06] property now watch him you can't get
[43:08] saved by
[43:10] beating on the altar or can't get saved
[43:13] by paying your tithe or keeping some
[43:16] days or abstain from meats you don't get
[43:20] saved by that it's by faith are you
[43:23] saved and that through the grace of God
[43:25] you have to accept it first and believe
[43:27] it as your own personal
[43:30] property then you're saved amen then
[43:34] you're healed that's right right right
[43:37] he can't do anything until we confess
[43:40] it and so but you're limited God my God
[43:43] can do anything he wants to he cannot
[43:46] break his
[43:47] word if he has said it he has to keep it
[43:51] I didn't write the
[43:52] book right he's the one that said my
[43:56] sins is in the sea of forgetfulness if
[43:58] I'll believe
[43:59] it he wrote the book I didn't write the
[44:01] book see he can't do nothing until
[44:04] somebody says it that's right all right
[44:07] so then what has been the writing of the
[44:10] Bible as I've tried to cover right this
[44:12] is what somebody
[44:15] said right
[44:17] y that's right I gave it to you
[44:19] Wednesday night where the Prophet said
[44:23] what he
[44:25] said
[44:27] that it's laying on the pages of this
[44:30] book right and he said as long as it
[44:32] stays there it can be
[44:34] questioned right but he said when it's
[44:37] revealed to you it cannot be questioned
[44:40] that's right all
[44:42] right but see it's according to what
[44:45] we're confessing is according to what
[44:47] he's doing now if he is the high
[44:49] priest you know what a high priest does
[44:52] high priest makes an offering right an
[44:54] atonement you realize he can't make the
[44:56] atonement if I don't say it that's
[45:00] right now God will not override your
[45:02] free Mor agency and make you get saved
[45:05] don't ever think that amen see he's
[45:08] waiting on somebody to say it where he
[45:11] can come on the scene and make it
[45:15] manifest then we've got to confess the
[45:17] hour that we're living like I was
[45:20] illustrating see Martin Luther no
[45:23] telling how many times he had preached
[45:25] in and done great uh essays or what you
[45:30] call them written them about the just
[45:32] shall live by faith there was a lot of
[45:34] people already preaching a lot about the
[45:36] J shall live by faith before Martin
[45:38] Luther came along all right but see one
[45:42] day it came off the pages into a man's
[45:45] heart and he believed it and confessed
[45:49] it and the world was converted right
[45:52] amen right because he believed it and
[45:55] said it right how many other people was
[45:58] already saying those things read your
[45:59] history a
[46:00] little there were a lot of people
[46:02] protesting the Catholic Church before
[46:04] Martin Luther came on the scene that's
[46:07] right but they never was in the
[46:10] scriptural Point see when that scripture
[46:13] struck Martin Luther he looked down and
[46:16] I wrote it because it was on the thing
[46:18] they say he wrote down you know the CH
[46:21] shall live by faith
[46:24] alone
[46:27] right I wrote that in my Bible because I
[46:29] believe that
[46:30] too you see if it's not revealed to you
[46:33] that you just you live by faith you're
[46:35] not saved that's right
[46:37] amen and you oh no but I've done this
[46:39] I've done it if it's not revealed that's
[46:41] right
[46:43] right that was the new birth to Martin
[46:46] Luther amen and that was the new birth
[46:48] to the people of the age or the just you
[46:50] live by faith he wasn't crying and
[46:52] shouting and speaking in tongues and
[46:54] doing all those are are
[46:56] manifestations and
[46:58] thing which to first to believe in your
[47:00] heart and then confess with your mouth
[47:02] that's right what God
[47:06] says
[47:08] right but you know people don't want it
[47:10] that way they want some kind of an idea
[47:12] or a thought about what saved them I'm
[47:14] saved
[47:18] because you know that you say well I'm
[47:20] saved cuz I believe the message I gave
[47:22] you a quote Wednesday night where
[47:23] brother R he said I'm not saved because
[47:25] I bring this message that's right right
[47:29] oh he's not saved because he brings the
[47:32] message and you say I'm saved because I
[47:35] believe the
[47:36] message all right if you truly believe
[47:38] it that's right and if it's revealed you
[47:41] ain't got no problem right come
[47:44] on come on Church get right with it what
[47:47] about your sisters what about your hire
[47:49] your clothes your
[47:51] things you'll argue about it argue about
[47:54] it fuss about it gra about it complain
[47:57] about it try to find excuses well
[48:01] this you know but if it's ever revealed
[48:05] to you that's
[48:07] right right you won't cut your hair no
[48:10] more right you won't paint your fa if
[48:12] it's revealed to you right but until it
[48:14] is you'll go do it and try to justify is
[48:17] that
[48:18] simple right what a revelation takes
[48:22] away all things right that's right
[48:27] come
[48:29] on yeah but that ain't got nothing to do
[48:31] well it's in the word it's got something
[48:33] to do with it all right amen then
[48:37] see we studied as I said Wednesday night
[48:40] that God's waiting on you and
[48:45] I he's waiting on you and I to believe
[48:49] it and confess it amen then he can make
[48:53] it manifest Hallelujah
[48:57] right he can make it alive if we believe
[49:00] it that's right and say it but why
[49:03] wouldn't we want to say it are you
[49:09] afraid are you afraid to stand on God's
[49:17] word see why not stand on and say by
[49:19] Stripes I'm
[49:21] Healed you know God's waiting on you to
[49:24] say that where he can make it m
[49:26] you realize before the world ever begun
[49:28] he'd already by his do had healed you
[49:32] right but when it comes to you down here
[49:36] you got to say what he said back there
[49:38] that's right right you remember how I
[49:40] was bringing it out Wednesday
[49:42] night
[49:46] yes Abraham goes down to slaughter the
[49:49] Kings he ain't got no bible to read
[49:52] that's right he comes back from the
[49:53] slaughter of the Kings
[49:56] and he says Lord I'll give you
[50:00] 10% why didn't he say give him 50 or 60
[50:03] or 90 or whatever I said I'll give you
[50:08] 10% where did you get that thought
[50:11] from where did Moses get the thought
[50:14] from to speak the word now I wasn't the
[50:17] one that wrote the book so you argue
[50:18] with brother Randon brother BR said as
[50:20] long as it's a thought until you speak
[50:23] it it's not the word right
[50:27] amen he said until you speak it it is
[50:30] not the word we say well this is the
[50:32] word all this is letters on a
[50:35] [Music]
[50:37] page and I just quoted you if you want
[50:39] that where brother R said as long as
[50:40] he's laying on these Pages it can be
[50:45] questioned but if it's revealed it can't
[50:48] be
[50:50] questioned you see each writer in this
[50:52] book God spoke to them and they wrote
[50:55] what God
[50:58] Said you ever looked up what is thus
[51:00] sayith the
[51:02] Lord you ever just thought about
[51:05] it do you realize that means God
[51:08] speaking through somebody right that's
[51:10] right thus sayth the Lord is God
[51:12] speaking to a prophet to go speak it
[51:16] right well we don't have the sayith the
[51:18] lord well that's where you missing it
[51:19] that's right this is thus sayith the
[51:23] Lord this is God's word amen
[51:26] this is thus sayith the Lord yeah but if
[51:28] we just had thus sayith the Lord by
[51:30] Stripes your heel that's what the Lord
[51:33] said right
[51:36] sir all right come on are you listening
[51:39] then yes this to get to a
[51:42] thought cuz you see you are what you
[51:47] confess that you are that's right
[51:51] right
[51:52] y
[51:54] right
[51:58] I've confessed all of my life I was a
[51:59] Dale whether they like me or
[52:03] not but see I've always said that
[52:05] because that's what I
[52:06] believe
[52:11] right if you think you don't believe in
[52:13] predestination you better think about it
[52:15] I'm the 13th
[52:17] child and my daddy was 63 years old when
[52:20] I was
[52:21] born my mother was 42 or three
[52:26] you don't believe in predestination you
[52:28] you're really missing it
[52:30] right right but listen
[52:34] church are you listening yes is there
[52:37] any problem to say you're a
[52:42] Christian well I'm a Christian but I I
[52:44] just don't want to I don't want to I I'm
[52:46] just this is the way we do well we're
[52:48] really good at justifying something I
[52:50] I'm I'm
[52:53] embarrassed yeah you ever heard people
[52:54] say that there I'm embarrassed to say
[52:59] things I remember a prophet standing
[53:01] before
[53:03] God Moses remember his story and you
[53:07] know we life about him doing that and
[53:09] talk about it but he said Lord I've got
[53:12] a speech impediment well why didn't he
[53:14] say take it away and I'll speak it no he
[53:17] wanted to keep his speech
[53:20] impediment cuz that justified the fact
[53:22] he wouldn't have to say it so what did
[53:24] God do he gave him
[53:28] Aaron
[53:30] right but we we say what what he he de
[53:33] well why don't you say you're a
[53:35] Christian then go out and live like it
[53:38] but do you live any different out there
[53:40] than you live here is your come on
[53:43] sisters is your clothes and you dress
[53:44] and your H different here than it is
[53:46] when you go to work
[53:48] tomorrow then there's something wrong
[53:50] with you okay
[53:53] listen you know know God what he's
[53:56] really wanting you and I to do is
[53:57] realize who we
[54:02] are amen now we know for a certainty the
[54:05] Bible says it is he that hath made us
[54:07] and not we ourselves we are his people
[54:08] as sheep of his pastor we know the
[54:10] scripture
[54:12] right you know he chose you you didn't
[54:14] choose him
[54:17] right all right we see all he wants you
[54:19] to do is say
[54:21] it he's wanting us to realize Who We Are
[54:25] now I was illustrating it a lot of
[54:27] people protested the Catholic
[54:31] church right they had all kind of
[54:33] uprisings before Martin Luther came on
[54:35] the
[54:38] scene but none of them could go in the
[54:40] Bible other than their own thoughts they
[54:44] probably taught a lot like we do oh that
[54:46] old Catholic Church that old that's old
[54:49] babblin over here that's all this over
[54:51] there that's this over here you know
[54:53] they had Scholars too back then you know
[54:57] but you know what God never done a thing
[54:58] with none of them that's right
[55:02] right but when one little old man said
[55:05] to Joshua live by faith Heaven stopped
[55:08] for a moment and
[55:10] says now we're on the
[55:12] way you realize it had never been a
[55:15] restoration of all things had Martin
[55:17] Luther not started out to J you live by
[55:18] faith that's why I still believe what he
[55:20] taught now not what he taught of the
[55:22] trinitarian doctrine and all of the
[55:23] things he awful no but I believe what he
[55:25] taught him to just you live by
[55:27] faith
[55:29] am come on brother R said Calvin was a
[55:32] rascal said he taught the
[55:34] truth you know he said he called him he
[55:38] said he was a rascal but said he taught
[55:40] some
[55:41] truth but see when are we going to
[55:43] realize who we
[55:45] are well I know who I am I'm in the
[55:47] message of the
[55:51] hour
[55:54] well
[55:55] what about
[55:57] it to realize Who We Are by faith or to
[56:00] realize Who We Are by reading in
[56:06] books now who was it Daniel realized by
[56:13] books that's
[56:16] right they say by books we see all right
[56:19] they were dependent on something there
[56:21] to
[56:23] happen but just realiz in by
[56:26] books that time was about over didn't do
[56:29] any much good you know what he had to do
[56:33] he had to go to a time that he was set
[56:35] free am then what the book says came
[56:37] into reality
[56:40] right well when are we going to realize
[56:42] who we are you know and God's waiting on
[56:44] you and I to do
[56:49] that yeah but I've been in the message
[56:51] brother Dale for 40 years I know who I
[56:53] am well
[56:56] praise the Lord when you going to start
[56:58] saying
[57:03] it when you're going to start believing
[57:07] it may I quote brother random that
[57:10] they're laying in here he said it's got
[57:12] further and further and further away
[57:17] y now that's his words further and
[57:21] further and further away about three or
[57:24] four furthers
[57:26] away what with people confessing him but
[57:29] what are they
[57:33] confessing no we're confessing we're
[57:35] sick we're confessing with this we're
[57:37] confessing with that we're not
[57:39] confessing what the word
[57:42] says
[57:44] right see he just wants somebody to
[57:46] confess it all right let's just take a
[57:48] little
[57:49] thought cuz I gave you these the other
[57:51] night and it's a good time to put them
[57:53] in right now so let's just see what
[57:55] God's waiting
[57:59] on go ahead with number one Brothers
[58:02] which is revelation of Jesus Christ page
[58:07] 15 roll it on up cuz we'll just be
[58:10] reading this
[58:11] point but he talks about the coming down
[58:14] the time to you know to be cast into the
[58:16] Lake of Fire talking about Satan he
[58:19] fights that he cannot stand it now watch
[58:23] what is it say can't stand that's right
[58:27] amen he knows that the people get the
[58:31] true revelation of the true
[58:33] church and what she stands
[58:37] for excuse me what she is and what she
[58:40] stands for that she can do the Greater
[58:43] Works she will be an invincible Army
[58:46] what when she realizes and she gets a
[58:49] revelation of what she is and what she
[58:52] stands for and what she can
[58:56] do right if they get a true Revelation
[59:00] watch of the two Spirits within the
[59:02] framework of the Christian church and by
[59:05] God's spirit discern and withstand the
[59:08] Antichrist Spirit now let's take a this
[59:12] little thought there what would be the
[59:14] two
[59:18] Spirits now we could break it down and
[59:20] make it an antichrist Doctrine and we
[59:22] can make it a way off this way and make
[59:25] but really in plain sense what is two
[59:36] Spirits could you put it in simple
[59:39] terminologies where the children can
[59:40] understand
[59:41] it what is the two
[59:43] Spirits oh one of them is the spirit of
[59:46] God the other one is the spirit of the
[59:49] devil well now
[59:53] uh that's all right CU that's
[59:57] it but why don't you think simple
[59:59] everybody says Brother D is so deep I'm
[1:00:02] so simple until it's
[1:00:05] amazing cuz I think in
[1:00:09] Simplicity you realize there's two
[1:00:11] spirits that I'm
[1:00:17] against you know what they
[1:00:21] are one Spirit among the people of this
[1:00:24] message is we've already got
[1:00:27] it we've got it we got it here it's our
[1:00:31] we got
[1:00:35] it we don't want to hear nothing else we
[1:00:37] got
[1:00:39] it what's the other Spirit we going to
[1:00:42] get
[1:00:44] it one of these days we're going to get
[1:00:47] it there's two simple points of two
[1:00:52] Spirits now you can tie it all together
[1:00:54] with the Antichrist movement because
[1:00:55] he's the one that causes
[1:00:58] that may I quote brother
[1:01:01] random man is always looking at what God
[1:01:05] [Music]
[1:01:06] done and what God will
[1:01:09] [Music]
[1:01:12] do and what did he say the big problem
[1:01:14] was not seeing what's going on
[1:01:18] now you know there's nowhere in the
[1:01:21] Bible that God is of the future right
[1:01:25] he speaks of it writes of it no but he's
[1:01:27] not in the future neither is God in the
[1:01:31] past when he met Moses at the burning
[1:01:33] bush when that statement was made he
[1:01:35] said I am that I
[1:01:40] am now interpret that as the prophet
[1:01:44] would bring it and even with your
[1:01:46] writers get in him that simply means
[1:01:49] when he says I am that I am now you
[1:01:53] remember the story right back behind
[1:01:54] behind
[1:01:55] there God appeared to Moses and said I'm
[1:01:58] the god of Abraham Isaac and
[1:02:00] Jacob right read your
[1:02:03] Bible Moses said I know about that God
[1:02:07] of Abraham I know about the God of Isaac
[1:02:09] I know about the God of
[1:02:11] Jacob but said I ain't going to
[1:02:15] Egypt until you tell me your name read
[1:02:19] your
[1:02:20] Bible cuz they're going to want to know
[1:02:22] who sent me that's right and he said why
[1:02:24] do I tell them that's
[1:02:29] right he said tell them I am that I am
[1:02:34] Hallelujah Moses takes off to Egypt he's
[1:02:37] happy okay right why because God struck
[1:02:42] his heart I am means everpresent for
[1:02:46] eternity there's the words of the
[1:02:48] Prophet I am means ever presentent for
[1:02:51] eternity you realize the only thing you
[1:02:54] have in you that's Eternal is the word
[1:02:57] that's revealed to
[1:02:59] you
[1:03:01] amen I wish I had all of the knowledge
[1:03:04] that's in his
[1:03:09] head made known to
[1:03:13] me but that's why I'm not looking out
[1:03:16] you under and I'm not looking back there
[1:03:18] that's Faith Builder to talk about
[1:03:21] what's been that's Faith Builder right
[1:03:23] to talk about coming that's Faith to
[1:03:26] believe that God can
[1:03:28] do but we're right here
[1:03:32] today see that's what God's Wan somebody
[1:03:34] to do to realize where we at and what
[1:03:35] we're doing and what we stand for am
[1:03:38] look what he says about it he said Satan
[1:03:40] will be poweress before her he will be
[1:03:42] as definitely CED today as when he when
[1:03:46] Christ withstood his every effort to
[1:03:48] gain power over him in the desert now he
[1:03:51] says we will be an invincible arm he
[1:03:53] said we will be Satan will be definitely
[1:03:57] tarted brought down same as Jesus Satan
[1:04:01] hates Revelation but we love it with
[1:04:04] true Revelation in our lives the Gates
[1:04:06] of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we
[1:04:09] will prevail over them that's right
[1:04:12] amen now when Jesus said that about
[1:04:15] Peter he said the Gates of Hell cannot
[1:04:18] Prevail and we know the organizational
[1:04:21] systems that have all come down through
[1:04:23] there Satan has prevailed right yes
[1:04:25] that's right but to the true bride he's
[1:04:28] not been able to Prevail amen that's
[1:04:30] right amen right that's right well
[1:04:33] because the true bride realized who they
[1:04:36] were
[1:04:38] right when they knew who they
[1:04:41] were they not to worry about it
[1:04:46] right and see those Old Testament Saints
[1:04:49] look what they
[1:04:50] were that's why Hebrews 11 is wonderful
[1:04:53] to read over over and over and over and
[1:04:55] over and over and
[1:04:57] over the Warriors of
[1:05:01] faith that had each one of them a
[1:05:04] personal true revelation of almighty God
[1:05:08] read every one of them and go back and
[1:05:10] read it in the Old Testament go back to
[1:05:12] Abraham go back
[1:05:14] to David go back to
[1:05:20] them y David
[1:05:23] said
[1:05:26] a lion I've
[1:05:27] killed a bar I've
[1:05:31] killed he said and Goliath you'll be
[1:05:35] just like
[1:05:37] them you know how brother around and put
[1:05:40] the emphasis on you ever listen to him I
[1:05:42] love the way he emphasizing he said now
[1:05:45] if God thought enough to let David kill
[1:05:47] a bar and a
[1:05:48] line just to take care of a few little
[1:05:51] old
[1:05:53] sheep right you need that I'll be glad
[1:05:56] to show it to you he said what
[1:05:59] about when you come up to face
[1:06:02] goli that he wasn't talking about sheeps
[1:06:05] and goats he's talking about the
[1:06:07] children of God and God's Almighty
[1:06:11] promise that's why David never worried
[1:06:13] about
[1:06:15] it I've told you over and over and over
[1:06:18] right what happened when David was
[1:06:20] anointed to be king he wasn't afraid of
[1:06:23] nothing
[1:06:24] cuz he knew one thing for certain until
[1:06:26] he sat on that Throne he didn't care how
[1:06:29] many Giants was there he didn't care how
[1:06:31] many lines was
[1:06:34] there he was not going to be destroyed
[1:06:37] till he set on that
[1:06:39] Throne could we believe it that
[1:06:42] way I thought we believed it look at the
[1:06:45] next one and knoweth it
[1:06:47] not reaching
[1:06:50] 1965 look what he
[1:06:53] says
[1:06:55] lead us to something Lord that'll help
[1:06:57] us let's think of the lady of seean
[1:07:00] church age and its
[1:07:03] condition as far as I
[1:07:05] know I don't see anything to hinder at
[1:07:09] this time the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:07:12] now listen but now we've got it all set
[1:07:15] up the woman's got to be in the White
[1:07:19] House oh Russia's got to come out of oil
[1:07:22] we got to have this we got to have
[1:07:25] that now I didn't write the book that's
[1:07:28] right you argu the man that said it
[1:07:31] right he said I don't see anything to
[1:07:33] hinder at this time the coming of the
[1:07:36] Lord Jesus what outside of the Readiness
[1:07:40] of his
[1:07:42] church so who's God waiting
[1:07:47] on he's waiting on his church to stand
[1:07:50] up and believe
[1:07:52] it right
[1:07:55] mhm don't see nothing in it outside the
[1:07:58] Readiness of his church look I
[1:08:02] think that one of the the
[1:08:06] prophecies what's he
[1:08:08] saying all his whole message was
[1:08:11] prophecy that the church was going to
[1:08:12] stand in the end time and walk out on
[1:08:15] his word was that not his whole
[1:08:18] message how many prophecies do we
[1:08:21] need but God's waiting
[1:08:25] on you and I so we're still tied a
[1:08:27] little bit back to to that so let's get
[1:08:29] a few and then we'll try to pick up this
[1:08:32] evening and go on look at the next
[1:08:34] one as the eagle stirreth his
[1:08:39] nest look what he
[1:08:41] says you talking about civilization and
[1:08:43] all of the doings uh can't stand any
[1:08:46] longer she's just weaving and shaking
[1:08:49] What's it waiting for it's way past due
[1:08:58] right as it was in the days of Noah long
[1:09:01] suffering look it's lapped over time for
[1:09:07] the elect's
[1:09:09] sake we've been here 50 years for the
[1:09:13] elect
[1:09:17] sake right is that what he was saying
[1:09:20] there way P but God's waiting to get his
[1:09:24] church in
[1:09:26] order he's waiting on you and I may he
[1:09:30] Grant the
[1:09:31] blessing he's waiting on you and
[1:09:36] I waiting on us to believe who we are is
[1:09:40] that what it was right prior
[1:09:43] right that the one we was reading just
[1:09:46] prior to where he's waiting on you and I
[1:09:47] to realize who we are and what we're
[1:09:49] here
[1:09:52] for
[1:09:54] you see God don't need no help he just
[1:09:56] needs us to get out of the way but you
[1:09:59] know what I love about
[1:10:03] him listening to him the other night and
[1:10:06] I got it in the notes here
[1:10:08] somewhere Jesus was standing there and
[1:10:10] he
[1:10:11] said to the
[1:10:13] disciples now who was he almighty God
[1:10:16] right in human flesh he was the lord of
[1:10:20] the Harvest
[1:10:22] Right am I right now but yet he looked
[1:10:26] back at the disciples and said
[1:10:29] pray that the lord of the Harvest send
[1:10:33] forth
[1:10:37] laborers I mean he he's the lord of the
[1:10:41] Harvest and he's saying pray that I'll
[1:10:45] do what I said I'd
[1:10:48] do cuz he said he'd send forth the
[1:10:52] laborers but he said for you to
[1:10:56] pray you to say it you
[1:11:00] pray what did he need me and you
[1:11:04] for that's right he's the lord of the
[1:11:08] Harvest but he said pray that the lord
[1:11:11] of the Harvest will send forth laborers
[1:11:15] why because he give you something to
[1:11:19] do how many of you praying for God to
[1:11:22] hurry up and get this over with
[1:11:25] amen right you ain't old enough yet to
[1:11:28] the young
[1:11:30] ones you'll find out one of these days
[1:11:32] you'll get old enough to say Lord hurry
[1:11:35] up but that's because you're getting
[1:11:38] old
[1:11:41] right but think about
[1:11:45] it the lord of the Harvest God himself
[1:11:48] standing there says now you pray that I
[1:11:52] do what my word says I'm going to
[1:11:58] do so he wants you to
[1:12:01] pray did not John when he got over on
[1:12:04] patmas what did he come down with he
[1:12:06] said even though come Lord
[1:12:10] Jesus he'd seen all of the things and
[1:12:13] wrote about all of and he said even
[1:12:15] though come Lord Jesus
[1:12:17] yes
[1:12:19] right no we still hung up with them back

[1:12:26] the one that's back here that says we
[1:12:27] got we do we are we still like we used
[1:12:30] to

[1:13:01] truth they never prayed for God to come
[1:13:04] that's right they prayed for God to T
[1:13:06] where their family could get saved
[1:13:08] that's right well you don't want my
[1:13:10] family
[1:13:15] saved no but may I quote the
[1:13:18] prophet he said if you ain't got enough
[1:13:21] Faith that's right
[1:13:24] to believe for your family he said I
[1:13:28] doubt you got enough faith for your own
[1:13:31] self
[1:13:35] amen
[1:13:37] oh that changed it didn't

[1:14:31] him the Lord showed me in the scripture
[1:14:33] says you'll be there with your Offspring
[1:14:35] let settled it right
[1:14:39] right even before he came back to the
[1:14:41] Lord as a sinner I told my wife and
[1:14:44] forbid her to say a word about it I said
[1:14:47] not only is he coming back to the Lord
[1:14:50] but he's going to be standing in the
[1:14:51] pull pit ministering with me
[1:14:54] I said' Lord's already showed me
[1:14:56] that the reason I didn't tou and
[1:14:58] announce that I didn't want him to know
[1:15:01] that and when he come back to the Lord I
[1:15:03] certainly didn't tell
[1:15:06] him and he comes to me one day and he
[1:15:08] says Daddy I want to talk to you I said
[1:15:10] you don't want to talk to
[1:15:11] me he said you know what I'm talking
[1:15:14] about I said I no go ask your
[1:15:16] mama I know what you're talking about
[1:15:19] but I ain't going to have nothing to do
[1:15:20] with it he said you mean you know that
[1:15:23] that I'm talking about that the Lord's
[1:15:24] called me to preach I said run run run
[1:15:27] run son until the Lord can run you
[1:15:31] down you said well you're crazy I know
[1:15:34] it but I believed it you know what he's
[1:15:36] here ministering so that solves that
[1:15:38] problem why don't you confess things
[1:15:41] that are
[1:15:42] impossible right amen but how many of
[1:15:46] you have got enough guts to stand up and
[1:15:48] say I claim my family amen amen
[1:15:53] I claim my children I claim my
[1:15:56] grandchildren great grandchildren I
[1:15:58] claim
[1:16:02] them why not believe it
[1:16:07] amen may I requote the prophet if you
[1:16:10] ain't got enough faith for them to be
[1:16:12] saved then you don't have no faith
[1:16:16] yourself amen right yeah but you just
[1:16:19] don't understand how bad my family is
[1:16:22] God's not in the business of being good
[1:16:24] to people and all he he he's kind of in
[1:16:26] the business of saving
[1:16:29] Sinners right okay I'm on the wrong
[1:16:32] thing
[1:16:35] listen waiting for the
[1:16:38] church to get into a
[1:16:41] place go ahead with number
[1:16:44] four which is the church choosing law
[1:16:47] for
[1:16:48] Grace we're in a terrible condition the
[1:16:51] church itself what did it do
[1:16:54] listen because we separated
[1:16:57] ourselves one separated to this one and
[1:17:00] one separated to that one we become
[1:17:03] great organizations what you got in the
[1:17:05] message now you in the two Soul you in
[1:17:07] the seventh univers you in the perua you
[1:17:10] and
[1:17:13] right right come
[1:17:15] on we become great organizational mind
[1:17:18] organization minded and everything just
[1:17:20] showing you exactly in type what what
[1:17:23] they did then and we would have went on
[1:17:26] over and been in the
[1:17:29] Millennium see you you get what he's
[1:17:32] saying right if we hadn't separated we'd
[1:17:34] have been in the Millennium you know
[1:17:35] what he's talking about the children of
[1:17:36] Israel for 40 years walking around and
[1:17:38] around out there in the
[1:17:40] wilderness right it was only a matter of
[1:17:43] a few days to walk straight into the
[1:17:45] promise and it was 40 years and we got
[1:17:48] 50 God give us 10
[1:17:50] more I believe that the coming of Jesus
[1:17:53] Jesus Christ is p
[1:17:55] you now that's 19 and
[1:18:01] 61 I could prove it by the Bible the
[1:18:04] Bible said Jesus Christ said himself as
[1:18:07] it was in the days of Noah and God was
[1:18:09] longsuffering not willing that any
[1:18:11] should perish was longsuffering waiting
[1:18:14] waiting holding off the Wrath waiting
[1:18:17] see if somebody else would and waiting
[1:18:21] and waiting and waiting as it was was in
[1:18:23] the days of Noah so will it be in the
[1:18:24] coming of the son of man God's
[1:18:27] longsuffering waiting to get his church
[1:18:29] in condition
[1:18:33] right what is
[1:18:37] it what is it he said instead of getting
[1:18:40] in
[1:18:44] condition we're getting further away all
[1:18:46] the
[1:18:51] time uh
[1:18:55] that's where we we we get to battling
[1:19:00] right 30 40 years ago you would miss a
[1:19:03] service for
[1:19:06] nothing you quit your job 30 years ago
[1:19:09] before You' Miss
[1:19:13] Services right right now you miss for
[1:19:19] anything he brother Dale well well
[1:19:24] all right take that as a slam in your
[1:19:26] face thank you you got what I'm talking
[1:19:30] about you talking about me
[1:19:33] yeses that solve the
[1:19:38] problem right
[1:19:40] okay what are you going to argue about
[1:19:44] look we ought have been in the
[1:19:45] Millennium we ought to been doing
[1:19:46] something for God we already went in 40
[1:19:49] years ago but no we've made the same
[1:19:52] mistake mistake they did they come to
[1:19:54] kades barnea 40
[1:19:56] years and God turned them back because
[1:20:00] of their
[1:20:01] unbelief come to Katie Baria and they
[1:20:04] turn back in the wilderness because of
[1:20:05] their
[1:20:11] unbelief what is it what is getting the
[1:20:13] church into
[1:20:21] condition well if we could if we could
[1:20:23] just get this we could get that you just
[1:20:25] wait one of these days that woman going
[1:20:26] to get in the White House boy we going
[1:20:28] to that woman's been in the White House
[1:20:30] a long
[1:20:32] time and brother randam made this
[1:20:34] statement in
[1:20:36] 1966 it wasn't the year he made it the
[1:20:39] year I heard it either that or
[1:20:42] 67 he said wait until that Catholic
[1:20:46] Church worms it way in the White House
[1:20:49] well I had very few things to be able
[1:20:51] didn't have no computers and things to
[1:20:53] do with very few things that I could
[1:20:56] come up with to see who was Catholics
[1:20:58] and who
[1:21:00] wasn't and I got to checking on it and
[1:21:03] searching out everything I could and I
[1:21:04] come find out about
[1:21:06] 1967 there was 1,500 Catholics already
[1:21:09] in the white
[1:21:10] house now you tell me how many's in
[1:21:13] there
[1:21:17] now and brother randam was the one that
[1:21:19] said it I didn't he said a woman in the
[1:21:21] white he said are the Catholic
[1:21:24] Church you don't read them do you you
[1:21:27] always want the woman in the White House
[1:21:29] you know why because woman ain't in the
[1:21:31] wife we at least got 6
[1:21:34] months right nobody wants to believe
[1:21:37] that the end is
[1:21:39] here wait a little longer please
[1:21:43] Jesus
[1:21:45] okay let me get a few
[1:21:48] more go back down North it
[1:21:51] not paragraph 283 which is number
[1:21:57] five and what are we coming here
[1:21:59] for what are we
[1:22:02] doing what are we
[1:22:05] coming what are we what are we doing are
[1:22:08] we coming here playing a
[1:22:12] game are we coming here meeting as a
[1:22:18] lodge are we coming here to play church
[1:22:21] can I put that in there it is speak
[1:22:23] right is that what he's talking
[1:22:25] about cuz remember he's talking to the
[1:22:27] church he ain't talking to the world he
[1:22:29] ain't talking about Lodge meetings and
[1:22:31] things
[1:22:33] right it's
[1:22:35] Christ can't come until that church is
[1:22:40] perfectly
[1:22:42] right he's waiting on
[1:22:44] us I believe we're at the
[1:22:48] end he's waiting on us
[1:22:51] amen
[1:22:54] God's waiting on
[1:22:59] us what kind of waiting is he doing
[1:23:01] number
[1:23:03] six pardon
[1:23:06] 1963 roll it on up you can read all of
[1:23:09] it it's placed on there for that
[1:23:11] purpose God is waiting the hour to see
[1:23:14] his church come to that
[1:23:17] position regardless of denomination
[1:23:20] regardless of creed color whatever it
[1:23:22] may be that's his entire church that his
[1:23:26] entire church would come to the place
[1:23:29] that they're displaying the token of the
[1:23:31] death of Jesus Christ
[1:23:35] am waiting on us to
[1:23:38] display you know
[1:23:40] what if that was 1963 and he's saying
[1:23:43] he's waiting on us to display it
[1:23:45] evidently the people wouldn't displaying
[1:23:46] it is that
[1:23:51] sensible
[1:23:53] look at the next one Paradox
[1:23:56] 1961 the only thing God's waiting on now
[1:23:59] I believe look Russia don't mean nothing
[1:24:02] to God you heard me Wednesday night some
[1:24:04] of you wouldn't hear what I was talking
[1:24:07] about you realize that in just a matter
[1:24:09] of hours that all these things can take
[1:24:13] place that's been spoke of by the
[1:24:15] prophet oh well ain't no war in the
[1:24:17] White House got to be 6 months you can
[1:24:19] have a coupe right now and she can take
[1:24:21] over that's right you don't believe that
[1:24:23] can happen in America that's where
[1:24:26] you're I'm trying to get away from
[1:24:28] saying
[1:24:30] stupid now I use the word idiots is that
[1:24:34] better on a bunch of people that don't
[1:24:37] believe things can
[1:24:42] happen one of your Presidents spoke of
[1:24:45] Marshall
[1:24:47] Law
[1:24:49] right and his big man with him said you
[1:24:52] can't do that them people got guns that
[1:24:57] was back in the
[1:25:01] 60s what you get what you you came
[1:25:04] to over in where was it the other day
[1:25:07] turkey or where it was that thing had
[1:25:09] been planned for months years almost for
[1:25:12] them to have that Coupe and it
[1:25:17] failed see all these things can be set
[1:25:20] up can happen in a moment
[1:25:22] Russia can drop a bomb down our Smoke
[1:25:25] Stack anytime they want to cuz we done
[1:25:27] give away everything we got in defense
[1:25:30] you know of our own
[1:25:34] defense so what is brother Brown
[1:25:36] saying Russia don't mean nothing to
[1:25:40] God he wants to get one
[1:25:43] man and listen at
[1:25:45] him he don't have to have big
[1:25:49] organizations he don't have to have big
[1:25:51] denominations
[1:25:53] he wants to get one man that he can wrap
[1:25:56] his Spirit into
[1:26:00] him that'll tell the rest of
[1:26:04] it there will be another
[1:26:07] Paradox and he until he can
[1:26:10] get someone completely surrendered that
[1:26:13] will do that that's the way God does his
[1:26:16] work he uses paradoxes that's
[1:26:19] right but but but but brother Dale
[1:26:22] brother brother brother Dale he he he's
[1:26:24] talking about
[1:26:25] himself okay I'll agree with
[1:26:28] you 50 years ago what's it done for
[1:26:32] you I'll agree he's talking about
[1:26:34] himself get one man I'll agree with
[1:26:40] you it was a man back there that with
[1:26:42] stood all of religious systems and
[1:26:44] things wasn't it but what good has that
[1:26:47] done you and
[1:26:51] me
[1:26:54] that's all
[1:26:56] right but what if God's waiting on one
[1:26:59] person now to stand up that's
[1:27:05] it what if he's waiting on you to do
[1:27:11] it what if he's waiting on you to stand
[1:27:14] up and say I see it and I confess
[1:27:19] it
[1:27:21] now let's put it back in your lap to
[1:27:23] where you can do it because every one of
[1:27:25] us is individuals in Jesus Christ right
[1:27:28] we are not a corporate group of people
[1:27:31] we are individuals God is waiting on
[1:27:34] individuals to stand up and believe who
[1:27:36] they are God is not waiting on a church
[1:27:38] as a group to stand up and believe who
[1:27:41] they are he's waiting on individuals to
[1:27:43] stand up Gentiles are
[1:27:45] individuals God never deals with the
[1:27:47] Gentiles as a corporate thing or a group
[1:27:50] of people right right
[1:27:53] right so everybody sitting here or to
[1:28:00] say that's me
[1:28:04] am that's me that's me
[1:28:09] am but are you afraid to say
[1:28:13] it what if everybody else misses
[1:28:19] it what if everybody else misses it it's
[1:28:22] left up to you
[1:28:28] right yeah but I believe it if brother
[1:28:30] so and so says
[1:28:33] it what if he don't never say
[1:28:41] it we done had one man stood up
[1:28:43] [Music]
[1:28:46] amen but we had a Martin Luther stood up
[1:28:50] and protested to Catholic church and
[1:28:52] wrote his thesis you know what they
[1:28:54] never got mad at him at all they could
[1:28:56] have killed the old boy anytime they
[1:28:58] wanted to they could have done anything
[1:29:00] they wanted to to him right but they
[1:29:03] wasn't afraid of
[1:29:05] him
[1:29:07] right but when the day came that the
[1:29:09] people stood up behind what he
[1:29:12] said the Gates of Hell started
[1:29:17] shaking brother brandham has done it and
[1:29:20] brought us the message he's been the
[1:29:22] David to kill the
[1:29:27] Goliath but you know what David probably
[1:29:29] went on vacation oh we see it in the
[1:29:31] movies he kept doing this that and the
[1:29:33] other come on get my point David
[1:29:35] probably went over and sat down and said
[1:29:37] get him
[1:29:38] boys and the rest of the people took
[1:29:41] care of the enemy they wasn't scared
[1:29:43] just called David killed Goliath that's
[1:29:48] one they had 100,000 or something back
[1:29:51] there
[1:29:52] they could have sent them every one out
[1:29:56] David you getting the point
[1:30:00] yes the children of Israel is what they
[1:30:04] run
[1:30:07] from because David he killed Goliath but
[1:30:11] then they rose up and took off straight
[1:30:13] toward the
[1:30:14] enemy
[1:30:16] right and they defeated the enemy amen
[1:30:20] David maybe never killed another
[1:30:25] man Arnold Von winkl
[1:30:28] Lord right everybody knows the
[1:30:31] story The Swiss Army was trapped and
[1:30:34] pinned
[1:30:37] down but he said this day I die for
[1:30:42] Switzerland he ran in and took the
[1:30:44] Spears and jerked them into his own body
[1:30:47] and died right there he was not the man
[1:30:51] that destroyed
[1:30:53] the army that was out there he just said
[1:30:56] in the hearts of the
[1:30:58] people to say he done it let's do
[1:31:01] it right when are we going to start
[1:31:04] believing God's message
[1:31:08] right when are we going to start saying
[1:31:10] it's here
[1:31:14] amen when are we going to start saying
[1:31:17] we are the people of God
[1:31:20] Amen
[1:31:25] well we'll do it if brother so and so
[1:31:26] agrees with you brother Dale well then
[1:31:29] you might as well forget
[1:31:33] it but I've got the tapes for
[1:31:37] 1980 from
[1:31:42] 2002 where at least you can go back that
[1:31:44] far and find out that I've been
[1:31:46] hollering and screaming this to you that
[1:31:49] somebody's got to believe it and stand
[1:31:52] on
[1:31:57] it and brother sitting back there he was
[1:32:00] up there the other day they had to do a
[1:32:03] a little simple thing of a
[1:32:07] stint that there's thousands of them
[1:32:09] done every day probably in Gainesville
[1:32:11] there's probably hundreds done every day
[1:32:14] a little old simple thing of putting a
[1:32:16] stin in your
[1:32:17] heart you know or vs or whatever you do
[1:32:25] well they stuck one in him and he died
[1:32:28] how many
[1:32:30] times two
[1:32:32] times that had to bring him
[1:32:35] back well you know what he wouldn't Hunt
[1:32:39] No Pope to get an
[1:32:41] audience with God he wouldn't hunting
[1:32:45] nobody else I don't think to get an
[1:32:48] audience what little bit he probably had
[1:32:50] in his mind he cried out to
[1:32:52] God and Lord help
[1:32:55] me we know what he's still alive today
[1:33:02] amen and like the fellow
[1:33:05] said things get to getting rough I don't
[1:33:08] want no
[1:33:10] secretary I want to talk to the head
[1:33:13] man cuz I don't want no
[1:33:16] secretaries I know how secretaries can
[1:33:18] mispel a lot of
[1:33:20] things now they might have the the whole
[1:33:22] Hospital operating on
[1:33:26] me right
[1:33:28] that's what about it don't you think
[1:33:31] it's about time for us to stand up and
[1:33:33] believe who we
[1:33:34] are stand up and say who we are amen
[1:33:38] that we're the Bride of Jesus Christ

[1:34:34] adoption we're not saved by
[1:34:37] works no
[1:34:38] way but our works prove what we are

[1:34:55] am what about it come on

[1:35:20] right well waiting on us to call him on
[1:35:22] the
[1:35:29] scene but church we could at least
[1:35:31] believe something
[1:35:36] anyway I sat in the study this week and
[1:35:38] studied and announced okay we'll have
[1:35:41] questions and answers and wrote a thing
[1:35:45] down cuz I knew we wasn't going to have
[1:35:47] questions and
[1:35:50] answers
[1:35:53] but see you don't believe that you don't
[1:35:55] believe that God can just show somebody
[1:35:57] in his own Spirit of
[1:35:59] saying don't write anything else down
[1:36:02] you ain't going to have time for
[1:36:07] it you're going to have to preach it
[1:36:09] this way because there's going to be
[1:36:11] company coming there's going to be
[1:36:13] people you got to change your way of
[1:36:15] state and got to go on a different
[1:36:17] way how many times have you ever heard
[1:36:19] me say that but I sit there in the study
[1:36:22] and say well Lord what's going wrong I
[1:36:25] get up and walk out of the study without
[1:36:26] one note written cuz I
[1:36:30] know something's going to
[1:36:33] change if we can believe in a god like
