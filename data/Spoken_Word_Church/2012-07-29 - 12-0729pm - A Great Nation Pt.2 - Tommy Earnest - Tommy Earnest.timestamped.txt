[19:43] Genesis 18 did I tell you right 18 and
[19:45] 18 seeing that Abraham shall surely
[19:49] become a great and mighty nation it's
[19:52] going to happen it shall surely happen
[19:54] he will become one and all the nations
[19:57] of the Earth shall be blessed I like
[19:59] verse 19 for today for I know him right

[20:21] he will command his children and
[20:24] household after him and they shall keep
[20:27] the way of the Lord to do justice and
[20:29] judgment that the Lord may bring upon
[20:31] Abraham that which he has spoken of him

[23:44] nothing mysterious no more you know we
[23:46] we we've gone we've gotten old enough I
[23:49] guess and been here long enough that
[23:51] none of us are out there trying to trip
[23:52] the light fantastic and find you know
[23:55] there's people still digging I want to
[23:56] find that secret little quote that
[23:58] nobody else has ever heard yeah let me
[24:01] tell you folks after all these years
[24:03] somebody else has heard it already
[24:05] there's 1192 tapes you're not going to
[24:08] sneak one in that we've never heard
[24:10] before not unless you got one that
[24:12] nobody else has got because the message
[24:14] has has um spread far and wide enough
[24:18] and it has it's made itself available
[24:21] right I I appreciate the availability of
[24:23] them yes sir amen that's right yes sir
[24:26] you remember the old days and I know
[24:28] before computers before internet
[24:31] preachers would show up with quotes and
[24:33] they were in the big volumes a lot of
[24:35] them so we would come out like this
[24:37] remember that yeah and we would hear
[24:39] your groans back there oh man that Guy
[24:42] brought 47 books with him we ain't going
[24:44] to never get out of here see I was there
[24:47] I remember that I came in the message in
[24:50] 1969 and I remember the first fellow
[24:52] that that brought out those trunk loads
[24:54] of books to preach out of and and sure
[24:57] enough he tried to stay all day he did
[24:59] he did fulfill what I was talking about
[25:01] a minute ago and but now we just print
[25:04] them off the computer and I got volumes
[25:06] right here just but we can wave them
[25:08] around y'all don't get as afraid anymore
[25:10] cuz you don't know how long they are or
[25:12] how many we're going to read and so
[25:14] you'll sit there and just be happy until
[25:16] we get to reading them all and then
[25:18] you're like oh he still brought too many
[25:20] but but I I appreciate the availability
[25:23] of the message I don't I don't agree
[25:25] with everything that that Jeffersonville
[25:28] does and the printing
[25:31] and they didn't have to ask me how to do
[25:33] it that's their program that's right God
[25:36] doesn't want me to take care of their
[25:37] program he wants me to take care of my
[25:39] program that's right but there's a whole
[25:42] lot of folks want to run the whole
[25:43] program I mean I me run into some of
[25:45] them every once in a while they got
[25:47] opinions about this guy should be doing
[25:50] that and I mean I think sometimes things
[25:52] that brother Wade ought to be doing but
[25:54] brother Wade don't feel that way and I
[25:56] don't have to run his program brother
[25:58] Sam's prog or your program we just we
[26:01] just try to follow the mind and the
[26:03] leading of the Lord and do the best we
[26:05] can we ain't got to have no big part man
[26:08] everybody for so many years worried
[26:09] about big parts and little parts and and
[26:14] and the guy that thought he had a big
[26:15] part we all ended up feeling like he
[26:17] didn't have no
[26:19] part you ever run into them yeah guys
[26:22] stand up here and try to convince you
[26:24] how big his part was in the economy of
[26:26] God yeah you found that after a while
[26:28] he's just done fell away and ain't got
[26:30] no
[26:31] part the only man deceived in all that
[26:33] really was himself cuz we knew sitting
[26:35] there listening to him that fell surely
[26:37] ain't got no part in this that's right
[26:40] but uh that's how things have went and
[26:42] and it's long I nobody it's from 69 I
[26:47] started preaching in 79 a know one of us
[26:50] that was around in those years that
[26:51] thought we would still be here there a't
[26:54] yeah we we've gotten long in the program
[26:57] just like Abraham was but in the time of
[26:59] its fulfillment it will right it will
[27:02] come to pass amen that's right so we are
[27:05] going to continue
[27:07] with with this little thought on Abraham
[27:10] this morning or this afternoon I'll
[27:12] probably call it morning or evening cuz
[27:13] I don't usually have an afternoon
[27:15] service but but you know which one I
[27:17] mean it's this one right here
[27:21] so if you if you'll put up a little
[27:24] quote there out of Abraham and his seat
[27:26] after him brother brandom says this he
[27:29] says now
[27:30] notice he perfectly typed Abraham and
[27:34] his seed after him all of brother
[27:36] brandom's preaching about Abraham right
[27:38] was not to just let us know there was a
[27:40] great patriarch that had great exactly
[27:43] you know the beginning of Christianity
[27:45] the beginning of our Salvation all of
[27:47] those things we looked at this morning
[27:48] it was not just so that we would have
[27:50] the great man Abraham to follow after
[27:53] right and neither did we have William
[27:55] brandham in the end time just to have
[27:57] the Great William brandham for us to
[27:58] follow amen that's right brother brandom
[28:01] said in one place and I wish I'd have
[28:02] brought that quote now that I'm thinking
[28:03] of it he says he says you know we're not
[28:05] doing this to build a monument to the
[28:08] great William Brandon we're we're here
[28:09] to follow the lord Jesus
[28:12] Christ through that message through that
[28:15] word I don't dress like him I don't have
[28:18] the right belt buckles to look like him
[28:20] I don't have the right hats to right or
[28:22] the bolo ties or I don't have any of
[28:24] that I'm just in some people's minds is
[28:27] not even in the message yeah because
[28:30] that's what the message was to them but
[28:33] brother brandom says this in in Abraham
[28:35] and his seed he says now notice he
[28:37] perfectly tiped
[28:38] Abraham and his seed after him now this
[28:41] is a tremendous message it's 1961 in
[28:44] Bloomington Illinois called Abraham and
[28:46] his seed after him and he says and
[28:49] notice how he says this he says and I'm
[28:51] going to
[28:52] follow follow the Junctions of Abraham's
[28:56] life and then follow the Junctions of
[28:59] Abraham's seed right and see if God kept
[29:02] his word letter by letter right rightly
[29:05] so Abraham wasn't there just so we could
[29:07] have a great hero of the faith but he
[29:09] was there to live he was there to live a
[29:13] life right and brother Brandon says
[29:15] we're going to follow the Junctions of
[29:17] his life and then we're going to follow
[29:19] the Junctions of his seed now Abraham we
[29:22] know and let me get back to it that
[29:24] there's only one way that we can be
[29:26] saved Y and that is being in the
[29:29] Covenant with Abraham because it was
[29:32] made to Abraham but the Bible said we
[29:35] being in Christ we being dead in Christ
[29:37] take on Abraham's seed and our HS with
[29:40] Abraham is that right Christ is the
[29:43] Royal Seed of Abraham out of Abraham
[29:45] Isaac out of Isaac Jacob out of Jacob
[29:47] Joseph so forth on down David and on and
[29:50] on so and so till finally the Royal seed
[29:53] was born which was Christ and in Christ
[29:56] made Abraham the father of all Nations
[29:58] and the abrahamic Covenant is confirmed
[30:00] to the people or given to the people
[30:03] here's our word what is it un
[30:06] conditionally amen right unconditionally
[30:09] means with no condition attached amen
[30:12] that was Abraham walking along we read
[30:14] it this morning Heathen idolator farmer
[30:17] Berry picker animal Slayer you probably
[30:21] like that didn't you deer hunters
[30:23] brother said Abraham went out in the
[30:25] bush and killed his Noonday meal yeah I
[30:27] saw you Hunters out out there amen yes
[30:30] my brother I like that that's right and
[30:33] all you animal rice people were saying
[30:34] oh no not Abraham surely he wasn't out
[30:36] there killing those poor
[30:38] animals see you you got to preach to
[30:40] everybody everybody same quote but a
[30:42] different reaction right all of you
[30:45] kindhearted bleeding hearted pea people
[30:48] yeah that won't wear fur what's wrong
[30:51] with them
[30:54] people brother brandom said our father
[30:56] Abra went out there and killed his
[30:58] Noonday meal that's right amen rise slay
[31:02] and eat is that is that the model we all
[31:05] live by I'm in Georgia I can say that
[31:08] can't go up north to them liberals and
[31:10] say that
[31:12] no they don't even want you to have a
[31:15] gun see and I'm not working for the NRA
[31:18] I want you to know that but just wanted
[31:20] to throw that him but that's what
[31:21] brother R said every he was just living
[31:23] an old normal life that's right and God
[31:26] came and said
[31:28] I am going to do this for you that's
[31:31] right I am going to do it for you you
[31:33] ain't going to do nothing on yourself
[31:36] you're going to have a great nation and
[31:37] I'm going to give you a Barren wife to
[31:39] make sure that you understand this is my
[31:42] program I love that amen I love that but
[31:46] this is what brother random said we're
[31:48] going to follow the Junctions of Abraham
[31:51] life and then follow the Junctions of
[31:53] Abraham's seed so what brother brandom
[31:55] is telling you is and I did a little
[31:57] chart up here I gave it to the brothers
[31:58] in the back they are technologically
[32:01] savvy enough to bring this up and I just
[32:04] simply took that message Abraham and his
[32:06] seat after him and if you'll go down
[32:08] through it at home you will find brother
[32:11] brandham taking each these seven
[32:14] Junctions of Abraham's life you'll say
[32:17] and then after that he did this and then
[32:19] after that God did that and so what
[32:21] brother Ram basically did in that
[32:22] message was took the Junctions of
[32:25] Abraham's life he started with his
[32:27] calling I went ahead and grabbed some
[32:30] scripture verses so that if you look at
[32:32] this at home later let me just say this
[32:34] every one of these Junctions is more
[32:37] than a message in itself if y'all want
[32:39] to have me back for a twoe Revival I
[32:41] take two nights on each
[32:43] one and when you could finally cover all
[32:46] of those Junctions of Abraham's life but
[32:49] otherwise we're just we just take the
[32:51] summary like brother random gave us
[32:53] first was his calling that was our text
[32:55] for this morning right he then went on
[32:57] down to what was a part of that calling
[33:00] was a separation he says after he was
[33:02] called he was required to separate right
[33:05] now again Paul looked back in the what
[33:09] did we call it this morning the um oh
[33:12] what was that term the God's God's
[33:15] estimation of Abraham right where he did
[33:17] nothing wrong and when brother randam
[33:19] got down to the separation Paul says you
[33:22] know every Everything Abraham did he
[33:24] staggered not at the promise of God he
[33:26] did everything just right but if you
[33:27] remember when he separated yeah he
[33:30] didn't quite separate the way God had
[33:31] told him to do why he brought a lot
[33:33] along with him brought his nephew along
[33:36] and brother Ram said yet when Paul
[33:38] looked at that he couldn't even see it
[33:40] he couldn't even remember it right right
[33:42] oh don't you see it but there's the
[33:44] separation we get on over then brother
[33:47] brandom talked about God then came and
[33:48] confirmed that Covenant to him you
[33:51] remember the split sacrifice that's more
[33:53] than two nights of meeting right there
[33:55] that split sacrifice the smoking furnace
[33:57] came down between him right the third
[34:00] state or the fourth stage then was when
[34:02] he met him and in just one little verse
[34:04] brother Brandon preached some tremendous
[34:06] tremendous things when God introduced
[34:08] him to Abraham as
[34:09] elh the many breast in he strengthened
[34:12] him he came and he strengthened Abraham
[34:15] for the rest of the journey and also for
[34:17] receiving the promised son right after
[34:20] he strengthened him in Genesis 17 and5
[34:22] brother brand said he placed him he
[34:24] changed his name in Genesis 181 the one
[34:28] of the last visitations he appeared to
[34:30] him on the plains of mamory right
[34:32] shortly after that there was one more
[34:34] Junction that brother brandom identifies
[34:36] in Abraham's life and that was that he
[34:39] not only changed him back to a young man
[34:42] and woman again as him and Sarah but he
[34:44] also healed them because they were not
[34:47] he said you change them back and they're
[34:48] still going to be be Barren they're
[34:51] still going to be sterile they're still
[34:52] going to be infer right and then after
[34:55] those seven Junctions of Abraham's life
[34:57] then came the promised son that you know
[35:01] it it it it really wasn't much of a
[35:03] mystery to me after I studied this out
[35:05] and went over that message over and over
[35:07] again that there was seven Junctions of
[35:10] Abraham's life that brother Bram
[35:12] identified right remind you of anything
[35:14] else you ever heard of before let's see
[35:16] you know you got that's pyramid kind of
[35:19] remind me seem like there's seven of
[35:21] those before the Capstone come out
[35:23] that's right there it is see just just
[35:25] the same thing so I want I only wanted
[35:27] to drop that in and get you to
[35:29] understand what brother ad is saying
[35:30] we're going to look at the Junctions of
[35:32] his life and let me say to each one of
[35:34] you Believers sitting here you you've
[35:35] had to go through every one of those
[35:37] Junctions right it's just like stature
[35:40] of a perfect man you're not going to get
[35:42] to the Capstone until all seven have
[35:45] become a part of your existence right
[35:49] justification you know the the first
[35:51] level brother on up through the
[35:53] temperance and patience and godliness I
[35:56] know there's a lot of preaching on
[35:57] stature of a perfect man and I know the
[35:59] Thunders people messed it up for a long
[36:01] time yeah and there's been all kinds of
[36:05] excellent teaching there's been all
[36:06] kinds of erroneous teaching on the
[36:08] Statue of a perfect man but here was
[36:10] Abraham walking through those same steps
[36:13] going through each each phase just like
[36:16] just just like the statue of a perfect
[36:18] man and so every one of you is Believers
[36:21] you got to go through every one of them
[36:22] you know I mean I mean you have to you
[36:24] have to see yourself identified in the
[36:27] separation in the confirming of the
[36:28] Covenant in the strengthening and in the
[36:30] placing in God appearing to you amen
[36:34] it's there for you and and and that was
[36:36] the purpose of Abraham's walk was so
[36:39] that the believer Abraham and his
[36:42] seed and his seed after him amen do you
[36:47] believe that amen and his seed and
[36:49] that's why you know brother brandham as
[36:51] he approached these messages Abraham and
[36:54] his seat after him he said now this is a
[36:55] very timely message he said I've already
[36:57] preached it two or three times he said
[36:59] this is my third time and then he went
[37:01] to Chicago the very next week and he
[37:03] preached it again the very same thing so
[37:05] he was he was trying to reinforce to the
[37:07] people that follow your steps along with
[37:10] faithful Abraham this is this and you
[37:12] will find yourself in there and God will
[37:15] visit you and do every one of those
[37:16] things for youw if you need strength he
[37:19] will strengthen you right it's just
[37:23] there's a study in each one but I just
[37:24] wanted to put that up for you amen we're
[37:26] going to look at at since we found out
[37:28] this morning it was not not the Flesh of
[37:32] Abraham right that God built the kingdom
[37:35] of B we want to discover what it was and
[37:38] and brother bandam in many places gives
[37:41] us a hand go back to our verse there in
[37:43] Genesis 18 and verse 19 I love those
[37:46] words for I know right him I know him
[37:51] what what you know we could just go on
[37:52] and quit and go home
[37:54] after I know him amen before I know him
[37:58] just let that sink in you know we're not
[38:00] just we're not just a church down in

[38:59] off the
[39:01] street and became a part of the economy
[39:04] of God we are sitting here like Abraham
[39:07] wait a minute I know
[39:09] you you belong there what did Brother
[39:12] brandom tell brother green I've heard
[39:14] brother Perry green tell this many times
[39:16] when brother brandom went back through
[39:17] his family lineage yeah he said he
[39:19] brought your great-grandfather over here
[39:20] in Russia man this thing just falling
[39:22] off today not leave it alone oh leave it
[39:24] alone it's okay it be down around my
[39:25] ankles here

[39:32] great grandmother over here in Russia
[39:33] and your grandfather over here and he
[39:35] brought them and they went here and then
[39:36] here and here and you were in Texas and
[39:37] then tracked it right down yep I wish he
[39:41] would have done that for me but I was
[39:43] too little I wasn't old enough it wasn't
[39:44] my lot in life but I'm glad for that
[39:47] because it lets us know we're not just
[39:49] just apples in a bushel here and all of
[39:52] a sudden we're just another knot on the
[39:54] log right brother every one of us can
[39:56] identify in that scripture for I know
[40:00] him God called your
[40:02] name he called your name right amen oh
[40:07] you're saying he called Tom Ernest that
[40:09] no he didn't necessarily call that but
[40:11] there was an election amen God built his
[40:15] kingdom on the heart of Abraham right
[40:19] amen let me read you a couple of quotes
[40:20] and I gave them to the brothers back
[40:22] there to follow along it was the heart
[40:24] it wasn't the Flesh of Abraham God built
[40:26] the kingdom upon it was the heart and
[40:30] this is in a message called Faith
[40:32] Charlotte it's all right I'm I'm I'm not
[40:34] going to lose it you keep do IET okay
[40:37] it's in a message called faith brother
[40:39] bandam says so
[40:41] Abraham 75 years old married to his Half
[40:45] Sister Sarah they come down from Cala
[40:48] dwelt in the shinar lived a good long
[40:51] lives of people
[40:52] then they'd go out in the morning and
[40:54] get some berries there's some similar
[40:56] quote to what we read go out noon time
[40:58] kill an animal with a bow or a
[41:00] spear didn't say nothing bu no rifle did
[41:02] he no so if you all if you Hunter men
[41:05] want to follow in the line of
[41:07] Abraham you have to go out and kill an
[41:09] animal with a bow or a
[41:13] spear come on that's how we get our meat
[41:15] around
[41:16] wiah go with a bow and a spear and we
[41:19] get our
[41:23] meat we're talking about ordinary went
[41:26] out with a bow or a spear and had their
[41:28] proteins few berries go to bed and lived
[41:29] a good normal life but this man not
[41:32] because he was different but because God
[41:35] and brother said oh I just love to push
[41:37] it down see right because God saw Grace
[41:41] in the heart of Abraham that's right and
[41:44] saved him by election amen wasn't what
[41:46] he looked like wasn't who his parents
[41:48] was wasn't how long he had been in the
[41:51] message wasn't if he had ever heard the
[41:53] message he's a heathen he's an idolator
[41:56] walking along and God says I know him I
[41:59] don't know him about what he looks like
[42:01] I don't know him by his physical
[42:03] characteristics I don't know him by his
[42:05] Good Deeds right amen I don't know him
[42:07] because he's a great politician in the
[42:09] city right I know him because in his
[42:13] heart it was the heart of Abraham that
[42:16] God built right the kingdom of and he
[42:18] push it down brother BR says because God
[42:21] saw Grace in the heart of Abraham and
[42:24] saved him by election give him the
[42:26] promise you haven't chose me y you
[42:30] haven't chose me I chose you oh
[42:34] man people said people said I just
[42:37] toiled and wrestle seeking God oh no
[42:40] that's right oh no he's changing our
[42:42] mind about about our election isn't it
[42:45] yes sir well I just toiled and wrestle
[42:47] seeking God oh no it was God seeking you
[42:51] you just wouldn't turn loose no man
[42:53] seeks God no man has s God at any time
[42:56] man is a coward he runs from God but God
[42:59] seeks man oh don't you believe that in
[43:02] the message Jehovah Gyra Abraham in his
[43:06] heart knew them were not ordinary men
[43:09] yeah those three that walked up there
[43:11] talking to him on the notice he run in
[43:14] real quick says Sarah get your sifter on
[43:16] and on that quote goes Abraham in his
[43:18] heart in Jehovah gar 57 Indianapolis now
[43:22] notice Abraham just an ordinary man but
[43:24] God by election Sovereign Grace called
[43:27] Abraham when there's many young men in
[43:30] the land in in that day there was
[43:32] probably some more capable of doing the
[43:35] job you know what he's talking about
[43:37] they probably had fertile wives yeah
[43:41] come on there other guys could have been
[43:42] a great nation they didn't marry Barren
[43:45] women right that's what he's trying to
[43:48] tell you there was probably some more
[43:51] capable of doing the job as the world
[43:53] would think than Abraham was but God
[43:56] knows the
[43:58] heart that's it sometimes we wonder how
[44:01] God takes the foolish things to confound
[44:03] the wise but God knows the heart of man
[44:07] oh he goes on now oh here we go men he
[44:09] said now you people when you're
[44:10] selecting your pastors you usually slip
[44:12] the guy in great big seven-footer with
[44:15] curly hair and so forth man I ain't
[44:18] talking about Lula Georgia is
[44:20] he I know seven-footer curly hairs
[44:24] Hollywood type yeah not him no sir he
[44:27] ain't talking to y'all skip that one
[44:29] over sometimes God don't even choose you
[44:31] want somebody that'll be a mixer it'll
[44:33] go to the card party with you and set in
[44:35] the game man wants mixers but God wants
[44:37] separators I just threw that in for
[44:39] extra measure that wasn't part of our
[44:41] lesson at all but do you see over and
[44:43] over let me read you another Abraham was
[44:45] sitting poor in the minority sitting out
[44:46] under the oak tree he R this is be
[44:49] certain of God he raised up his eyes saw
[44:51] three man coming they look like men dust
[44:53] on their clothes they said they were
[44:55] strangers they were passing through but
[44:57] there was something in the heart of
[44:59] Abraham that he know they were more than
[45:02] men it's the heart the heart over and
[45:05] over amen the marriage of the Lamb
[45:07] Phoenix
[45:09] 1962 remember the Holy Spirit was what
[45:12] cut into your heart and come up here
[45:14] just think of the places he cut and that
[45:16] person will never live that down they'll
[45:18] always remember if our hearts condemn us
[45:20] not right but when you come with
[45:22] something in the word of God and you
[45:24] bypass it that's not Abraham
[45:26] seed Abraham kept the promise of God in
[45:30] his heart regardless of what come or
[45:33] went you know what come or went ishma
[45:36] come and went his trip down to ABC come
[45:39] and went but go Abraham kept the promise
[45:42] of God in his heart it was not the
[45:45] failings right it was it was the story
[45:48] that Paul told of Abraham the heavenly
[45:52] vision that God had of Abraham that's
[45:54] right
[45:56] that's why brothers and sisters when
[45:58] when El when we were told in Malachi 4
[46:01] that Elijah was going to come yeah why
[46:04] why does this scripture Escape us so
[46:06] often right why does intellectualism
[46:08] seep into this message when the word of
[46:10] God in Mal when Elijah was promised to
[46:13] come you know it I don't need to turn
[46:15] and read it you don't need it to on the
[46:17] screen behold I will send you Elijah the
[46:20] prophet and he shall turn the our hearts
[46:25] hearts of the people right back to the
[46:28] father he shall turn the hearts right
[46:32] Elijah came to deal with the
[46:35] heart it's it's a far cry from what so
[46:37] many places in this message has become
[46:40] right amen a lot of churches believe
[46:42] that Elijah came to turn the neck yeah
[46:45] yeah yeah the next big thing that they
[46:47] hear something new and they jerk around
[46:49] and that's what Elijah came to do yeah
[46:52] he they think that Elijah came to just
[46:54] have great
[46:56] Sensational things to talk about right
[46:59] he didn't come to turn our necks right
[47:02] certainly our minds have been renewed
[47:04] we've had to get a new mind but he came
[47:07] to turn the
[47:09] heart the kingdom of Abraham Abraham's
[47:12] seed is built upon the heart of Abraham
[47:15] oh don't you see it that's right amen it
[47:17] was the heart the heart the heart over
[47:21] and over let me read you a couple of
[47:22] more I've got a few of them here and
[47:24] they're and they're all just so good
[47:26] they're all so good brother random over
[47:27] and over it was the heart it was
[47:29] something in his heart right he was an
[47:31] ordinary man and God looked at his
[47:33] ordinariness and he wasn't interested in
[47:35] that right let me just say that again he
[47:38] wasn't interested in Abraham's
[47:40] ordinariness right sometimes we hold our
[47:42] ordinariness up as a badge of honor yeah
[47:45] he's not interested in that either right
[47:49] what did Brother BR say in perfect
[47:50] strength by Perfect weakness he takes
[47:53] the nobodies to become the somebody
[47:55] right and he said in that quote he said
[47:57] now you may be a somebody and God can
[48:00] turn you into nobody so he can make you
[48:03] a somebody
[48:04] again but it's the heart it is the heart
[48:07] the unconditional Covenant that God gave
[48:11] Amen to the heart there is one more
[48:12] quote that I want to read on that and
[48:15] for those of you that are being baptized
[48:16] I want you to think of this one
[48:18] especially today this is in the
[48:19] indictment way down in
[48:21] 1963 brother bam says look at that
[48:23] little old ill Fame woman she recognized
[48:26] it you know he's talking about the woman
[48:27] at the well she wasn't
[48:55] he judges your
[48:57] heart what you want to be exactly why
[49:01] did the little woman's testimony means
[49:03] so much to brother brandom I I'm not
[49:06] what I want to be but I know I ain't
[49:08] what I used to be right right right I'm
[49:11] not what I ought to be and but she
[49:14] wanted to be in the perfect image of God
[49:17] he judges your heart what you want to be
[49:20] she didn't want none of that stuff when
[49:22] this flashed before her that's what she
[49:24] wanted right amen no matter what she was
[49:26] then she was ready to come right God
[49:30] judges the heart man judges the outward
[49:32] appearance God looks upon the heart no
[49:35] matter what she was that light flashed
[49:38] and that settled it she caught it the
[49:40] essence of eternal life you want to
[49:43] catch some Essence just sit under that
[49:45] word and when that that's what's these
[49:47] candidates coming for baptism the light
[49:50] has flashed in front of them and they
[49:51] want that right amen they want that the
[49:54] best we can do is look at him and say
[49:56] not looking so good maybe but it's the
[49:58] heart that God looks at and let me
[50:01] promise you one thing brothers and
[50:03] sisters if you get the heart right the
[50:05] rest of it is going to
[50:08] follow that's what's wrong with
[50:11] people you're not going to sit here this
[50:13] ill Fame woman didn't go back to her old
[50:16] lifestyle but when her heart was turned
[50:18] when her heart was changed next thing
[50:21] you know the rest of it began to line up
[50:24] right and I know what you're all sitting
[50:26] there thinking you well I've known a lot
[50:28] of people I I've heard this a lot I've
[50:30] known a lot of people they look right on
[50:33] the outside but they're wrong on the
[50:35] inside y'all ever run across any of them
[50:37] yeah
[50:38] yeah well I know them they say they're
[50:41] right on the inside but they're wrong on
[50:42] the outside yeah let me tell you
[50:45] something you can be right on the
[50:47] outside you can have everything perfect
[50:49] according to this message you can have
[50:50] hair dress everything you can have it
[50:53] just right and be wrong on the inside
[50:57] but I can promise you you cannot be
[50:59] right on the inside and stay wrong on
[51:01] the outside you know that you
[51:03] been you know if that heart turns when
[51:07] Malachi turns that heart back to the
[51:09] word right you will not continue in your
[51:12] errors you will not and God will judge
[51:15] you on what you want to be so if you're
[51:19] brand you if you're just now starting
[51:21] the journey it don't matter if I've been
[51:22] here 40 years or brother Sam's been here
[51:24] 60 years Years or or how long these
[51:27] other people have been in the word from
[51:29] the moment your heart is turned you just
[51:32] caught up I want understand you just
[51:35] caught up we don't have to go down the
[51:38] Romans road like the Baptist do you know
[51:40] to be a good Baptist you got to go down
[51:42] the Romans road you know you got to do
[51:43] everything this verse this verse some of
[51:46] those SEALS or statue of a perfect man
[51:48] people you got to have faith then
[51:49] tempers and patience and you got to get
[51:51] them one after the other yeah if you got
[51:53] here 40 seconds ago and when your heart
[51:55] was turned to this word right you just
[51:58] caught up you are even the ground is
[52:01] level at the foot of the cross my dear
[52:03] brother and sisters and when your heart
[52:05] turns we're not worried about the
[52:08] outside it might look a little scruffy
[52:10] right now but with the heart following
[52:12] the body is going to follow right and
[52:14] that is a that I appreciate what our
[52:16] brother Dale said this morning the works
[52:18] that we are that we manifest in our life
[52:21] that is an appreciation for what God has
[52:23] done right amen it's not V a it's
[52:26] appreciation I don't cut my hair just to
[52:29] prove that I believe the message I just
[52:32] do it I don't want no long hair you know
[52:34] right you sisters don't wear your
[52:35] clothes right just because you're
[52:37] supposed to that's right you didn't come
[52:39] to church today just because you were
[52:41] supposed to right come on you came
[52:43] because something drew you drew you he
[52:48] judges your heart what you want to be
[52:51] and every time we slip up like Abraham
[52:53] did like Moses did did like every every
[52:56] other Saint in the Bible did like our
[52:59] own Prophet did every time we slip up
[53:01] and make a mistake there's something in
[53:03] our heart says we don't want that and
[53:06] God judges you on what you want to be
[53:08] not what you are I mean I might stumble
[53:11] my toe every other day right I like that
[53:14] you know that's why he let Peter fall in
[53:16] the water right you know if he had to
[53:18] let Peter fall on the land you know what
[53:20] the Catholics would have done they' have
[53:21] built a church right on top of that spot
[53:24] they' have picked that spot where Peter
[53:26] fell on the ground and they have built a
[53:27] church and said this spot right here
[53:29] there's a little hole there where Peter
[53:31] fell a little divot in the ground yeah
[53:33] this is Peter's holy hole right here
[53:35] this is this is what we got but he let
[53:37] him fall in the water so you know that
[53:41] when he picked him up there was no trace
[53:42] of it left behind wasn't no marker left
[53:46] yeah it's like fishing putting X on the
[53:48] bottom of your boat that's where you
[53:49] know where the fish are come
[53:52] on see you fish from under laughing
[53:55] y'all done done that ain't you right
[53:57] yeah that's what he said to Peter put a
[53:59] mark right here on the boat that's where
[54:01] you fell yeah but he don't remember it
[54:04] because when he lifted him up the waters
[54:06] closed in there was no reminder because
[54:08] he knew what Peter wanted to be and oh
[54:11] that helped Peter so much cuz he went
[54:13] out and he lived a good life after that
[54:15] really come on I'm looking at Peter now
[54:17] like brother here's Peter in the garden
[54:19] when they were going to arrest Jesus he
[54:21] draws out his
[54:23] sword yeah come on if y'all really think
[54:26] he was aiming at that guy's ear y'all
[54:27] are badly
[54:29] mistaken yeah he misfired yeah Peter
[54:34] misfired his General intentions was to
[54:36] take care of that man that was arresting
[54:38] our Lord but he misfired instead of
[54:41] getting the loing it off right at the
[54:42] neck he only got the ear right maybe it
[54:45] got dodged I don't know what happened
[54:46] but Peter misfired on the sword and
[54:49] Jesus said put your sword up you don't
[54:52] want to be that way right how many of
[54:54] y'all have ever misfired every once in a
[54:56] while oh yeah how many of y'all been
[54:58] wielding The Sword and you misfired come
[55:00] on come on you misfired that brother
[55:02] over there ought to not be doing that
[55:03] instead of helping him up yeah instead
[55:06] of lifting him up when we see our
[55:07] brother down as the prophet taught us to
[55:09] do we misfire with the sword some of us
[55:13] got a pile of ears laying around our
[55:15] feet come on because we don't know I
[55:20] don't know what God wants out of you I
[55:22] don't know what God wants out of our
[55:24] brother here and our sister here and
[55:25] every one of you sitting out there amen
[55:28] but I know that if your heart is in the
[55:30] right place you will manifest you will
[55:33] come to the full fruit of what God wants
[55:35] out of
[55:36] you but if I sit around and try to do it
[55:38] I'm going to carve you up just like
[55:40] Peter did I'm going to you shouldn't do
[55:42] this and you should do that and you I've
[55:44] had so many people tell me what I ought
[55:46] and not not to do I got a quote where
[55:49] brother Randon was talking about when he
[55:51] he promised that the Lord told him he
[55:53] was going to have a son his name was
[55:54] going to be Jo Joseph you remember that
[55:56] brother said that woman there in the
[55:58] city was trying to run my life you
[56:00] remember that quote I should have
[56:01] brought it it's a good one he said she
[56:03] was trying to tell and she sent out a
[56:05] letter criticizing when when when the
[56:07] the girl was born and and criticizing
[56:10] brother R he said that's just a woman
[56:12] that thinks she ought to be able to tell
[56:14] me how I ought to live my life and how
[56:16] things ought to be done I wouldn't want
[56:18] to be
[56:19] her but that's all I'm saying to you
[56:21] brothers and sisters if if it was left
[56:23] in our hands what you ought to do you
[56:25] ought to do or you we'd just be carving
[56:27] each other
[56:28] up I said we'd have a bag of years to go
[56:31] home with before it was over because
[56:33] we'd be slicing and dicing and cutting
[56:35] up everybody to our
[56:37] satisfaction but you don't know what God
[56:39] wants with me and I don't know what he
[56:40] wants with you and it ain't none of my
[56:42] business because I know if your heart is
[56:45] turned the holy spirit will come and I'm
[56:47] supposed to pray for you that you will
[56:49] recognize the leading of the Holy Spirit
[56:52] as he comes to you I'm not supposed to
[56:54] come along and and change your style of
[56:56] life or do this for you or that for you
[56:58] I am to pray for you I am to ask the
[57:01] Lord that he because if I change you
[57:04] you're going to unchange
[57:05] Anyway come on how many of us have ever
[57:08] affected a great change on somebody if I
[57:10] can talk you into something somebody's
[57:12] going to come along and can talk you out
[57:14] of it but if it's a revelation if God
[57:18] reveals to your heart this is wrong in
[57:20] my life Lord I Surrender it to you and
[57:23] he takes it away that's right how many
[57:26] of you in your smoking years ever throw
[57:27] them cigarettes away at new years's just
[57:30] to see where the pack
[57:33] landed you wanted to quit it was a good
[57:35] intention that's why brother brand
[57:37] didn't like resolutions he didn't like
[57:39] resolutions he liked
[57:41] deliverance and when God takes it from
[57:43] you it's gone there and my job is not to
[57:48] oh yeah we get all offended sometimes we
[57:51] hear those stories about brother random
[57:53] going to visit a sick man
[57:56] taking him a cart and a
[57:57] cigarettes oh man wind done went out of
[58:00] this place now ain't it not brother
[58:03] brand yeah yeah oh man that that's
[58:07] hurting some feelings right there I can
[58:08] tell we don't mention that in the pull
[58:10] pit to but think about it they did they
[58:13] did sure did that's on testimony you
[58:15] know what happened right amen you know
[58:17] what happened I heard brother Charlie
[58:18] Cox one time telling a story I don't
[58:20] know him I've never met him but I heard
[58:21] him on testimony he was telling a story
[58:24] about
[58:25] when they' first come into the message
[58:27] and brother R come surprised them
[58:28] driving up in their yard one day and
[58:31] said y'all may have heard this before
[58:32] sister Cox was out there hoing the
[58:34] Garden in a pair of blue jeans well you
[58:36] know what that's going to do to you know
[58:38] you just a new Christian you know you
[58:40] you want to be living right ought to be
[58:41] doing better and and and she just got
[58:43] all over beside herself he said just
[58:45] just really embarrassed and apologizing
[58:48] brother Brown said that's s right sister
[58:49] I've been thinking about getting my wife
[58:50] prepared just like
[58:53] that
[58:56] oh yeah there's your new doctrine
[59:00] is you know that wasn't right what was
[59:04] he knew if her heart turns he ain't got
[59:07] to worry about that no more we just make
[59:09] it our business way too early sometimes
[59:12] right I don't know I don't know why I
[59:13] said all that it's the heart on the
[59:16] heart of Abraham the kingdom of God was
[59:19] built on the heart of Abraham and your
[59:21] election is built on your heart not your
[59:24] standing in society not your good looks
[59:27] not your wealth or your lack
[59:29] thereof oh yeah we man I was raised in
[59:32] the South I'm a Tennessee boy yeah I
[59:34] knew what it was to keep them poor and
[59:35] keep them humble I know I mean I know
[59:37] what that was you had to have poor
[59:39] churches you couldn't have no money
[59:40] running around yeah couldn't preacher
[59:43] didn't deserve the Nickels he got yeah
[59:46] come on y'all been there yeah there had
[59:48] to be some money around some places
[59:51] somebody was telling me today about a
[59:52] sermon they heard where a brother was
[59:53] talking about about those Apostles and
[59:56] how they had somebody floating around
[59:57] among them every once in a while yeah
[59:59] thing you know those are things we just
[1:00:01] don't like to think about but that
[1:00:02] that's all I'm saying to you as we get
[1:00:03] in our mind exactly what everybody all
[1:00:06] look like act like do right passing
[1:00:11] opinions and yet our Prophet said when
[1:00:13] you see a brother struggling just just
[1:00:16] just don't go slice him up don't go
[1:00:19] don't go chew him up just lift him up
[1:00:21] pray for that brother let the same holy
[1:00:24] spirit that some Grace for you have some
[1:00:25] Grace in his life let it be so Lord he
[1:00:29] judges your heart what you want to be
[1:00:32] man judges the outward appearance that's
[1:00:34] all we got to go on I'm not a prophet if
[1:00:36] I knew your heart I could judge your
[1:00:38] heart right that's why those prayer
[1:00:40] lines were as special as they were right
[1:00:42] because he knew he discerned between the
[1:00:46] thoughts and the intents of the heart
[1:00:49] right don't you see there's the thoughts
[1:00:51] of the heart and there's also the
[1:00:52] intents of the heart and that's why they
[1:00:55] I believe it was Peter wrote over there
[1:00:57] even if our heart condemn us God is
[1:00:59] greater than our heart and he knows all
[1:01:01] things oh yeah your heart will mislead
[1:01:04] you sometime but it when it gets turned
[1:01:06] you go over there and read Corinthians
[1:01:07] when your heart turns to the Lord the
[1:01:09] veil is taken all and all of a sudden
[1:01:12] that word is new to you again that's all
[1:01:14] you can see is the unfolded word and all
[1:01:18] of a sudden every other part of your
[1:01:19] body just begins to fall into subjection
[1:01:22] it just falls into line right it's not
[1:01:25] because we got to do it it's just what
[1:01:26] we want to do man alive I'm out smoking
[1:01:29] all the cigarettes I want to smoke these
[1:01:31] days come on I drink all I want sister
[1:01:35] June was bothering us the other day on
[1:01:37] the text bother what do you want to
[1:01:38] drink when you get here what she knew I
[1:01:40] like die she was checking on everybody
[1:01:43] else and she just kept asking so I told
[1:01:45] my wife just tell her I want some Bud
[1:01:49] Light yeah she didn't ask us no more
[1:01:53] questions
[1:01:57] but I just want to inform y'all today I
[1:01:59] am just like brother brandom I drink all
[1:02:01] I want to drink I just enjoy all I want
[1:02:04] to enjoy I don't want none of it why
[1:02:08] because my heart has been turned to the
[1:02:09] word and it has led me to a more perfect
[1:02:12] way a more perfect deliverance and I
[1:02:15] never did drink so I wouldn't even know
[1:02:17] if I like but light or not amen it's the
[1:02:20] only one I could think
[1:02:22] of and she didn't buy me
[1:02:25] just let her all through it just so
[1:02:26] youall
[1:02:28] know he judges your heart he man judges
[1:02:31] the outward God looks amen upon the
[1:02:35] heart upon the heart for don't forget
[1:02:38] that brothers and sisters it was built
[1:02:40] upon the heart of Abraham for I know him
[1:02:45] I know him I I know him go back to
[1:02:48] Genesis 18 I know him I know him for I
[1:02:52] know him and and he will command his
[1:02:54] children glory and his household after
[1:02:57] him and they shall keep the way of the
[1:03:00] Lord to do justice in judgment that the
[1:03:04] Lord may bring upon Abraham that which
[1:03:06] he hath spoken of him yep that's our
[1:03:09] verse brothers and sisters there we are
[1:03:11] that he may bring upon us that which is
[1:03:13] spoken of us that he will fulfill we are
[1:03:17] in the hour of fulfillment right amen
[1:03:20] that's why there's not any great books
[1:03:22] written about escapades and and things
[1:03:24] going on here in the end time we're not
[1:03:26] writing another book of Acts because we
[1:03:29] are the last
[1:03:30] generation someone someone is going to
[1:03:33] fulfill Thessalonians 4 1 Corinthians 15
[1:03:38] and we have been chosen and that's why I
[1:03:40] said this morning I wasn't being
[1:03:41] critical of people that want to go home
[1:03:44] I want to go home I just want to go and
[1:03:46] fulfill that word on my way out right I
[1:03:49] want to go home there's a promise laying
[1:03:52] here right that that is brother Bron

[1:04:27] Abraham God seeing what was going to
[1:04:29] happen he made his Co Covenant after the
[1:04:31] world had gotten full of wickedness and
[1:04:33] so forth that went into Babylon God was
[1:04:36] searching out across the lands to try to
[1:04:38] find
[1:04:39] somebody who was honest in
[1:04:42] heart somebody he could give blessings
[1:04:45] to and of all the people there was in

[1:06:22] what your desires are it wasn't
[1:06:25] Abraham's desire he was a heathen right
[1:06:28] he come down from the Tower of Babel
[1:06:30] down in the valley of Shar in the land
[1:06:32] of the calans he was just an ordinary
[1:06:35] man nothing Abraham done not even his
[1:06:38] desires but God by grace and election
[1:06:41] chose Abraham that's the way he chose
[1:06:43] you not nothing you done what he done
[1:06:47] amen now remember to Abraham and his
[1:06:51] seed and his seed oh brother and sisters

[1:06:56] forever you all right man I got 89 more
[1:06:58] pages is that all right just making sure
[1:07:02] brother wait said it was
[1:07:05] okay oh what else can we say about you
[1:07:07] know go back quickly to Exodus chapter
[1:07:10] one tie it right in I want you to see
[1:07:19] this ex we read it this morning I like
[1:07:22] those first few words now these these
[1:07:24] are the names these are the names there
[1:07:28] was 70 went in you know how many names
[1:07:30] God knew all 70 right he wasn't
[1:07:34] surprised wait a minute who are you why
[1:07:36] are you why you trying to sneak down
[1:07:37] there in Egypt with my children yeah
[1:07:40] these are the names of the children that
[1:07:41] went into Egypt he knowed every one of
[1:07:44] them he named off the Patriarchs ex he
[1:07:46] didn't only know who Joseph was but he
[1:07:48] know where he was living at the time
[1:07:49] Glory that's why if you pray for a man I
[1:07:52] want to just say that he knows where
[1:07:53] everybody's living at come on we don't
[1:07:56] have to tell God you know my brother
[1:07:57] down there he's having such a struggle
[1:07:58] well I don't know maybe he's already
[1:07:59] been delivered of that maybe he got
[1:08:02] delivered 10 minutes ago and I didn't
[1:08:03] know about him right it's like that man
[1:08:06] that was chewing tobacco when brother
[1:08:07] Bram walked up on him and said you chew
[1:08:09] back he said no he said when did you
[1:08:11] quit just
[1:08:12] now just now he's delivered he's quit
[1:08:17] right but not only did God know the
[1:08:20] names of the 70 but he knew where they
[1:08:23] were living at right and he knew Joseph
[1:08:25] and he was already down there in Egypt
[1:08:27] right and so Joseph goes in with all 70
[1:08:29] of course they begin to grow but now let
[1:08:31] me ask you another question when 2
[1:08:33] million came out of
[1:08:35] there got to think big now he knew those
[1:08:38] 70 names these are the names when those
[1:08:40] 2 million came out of there how many
[1:08:42] names do you think he knew right oh he
[1:08:45] knew
[1:08:46] 1,997 200 no he knew all 2 million of
[1:08:49] them every name whether they were
[1:08:53] reprobate he knew the names of Coran and
[1:08:56] abum let me show you a scripture that I
[1:08:58] like over here in Exodus it's in chapter
[1:09:01] 32 follow just flip on over a few few
[1:09:04] pages
[1:09:06] there believe that's right Exodus Exodus
[1:09:09] 31 and verse two is what we're looking
[1:09:11] for I I just found this very interesting
[1:09:14] because he said about those 70 going in
[1:09:16] there I know their names but in Exodus
[1:09:18] 31 there's a big multitude now there
[1:09:21] they're fixing to build a
[1:09:22] tabernacle and the Lord spake unto Moses
[1:09:25] saying
[1:09:26] see I have called by name right bezel
[1:09:33] amen the son of Yuri bezel who's that
[1:09:38] he's the one that God knew who his name
[1:09:39] was right I have called by name bezel
[1:09:44] the son of Yuri the son of her right the
[1:09:47] of the tri I have filled him with the
[1:09:49] spirit of wisdom or the spirit of God
[1:09:51] and wisdom and understanding and
[1:09:52] knowledge in all manner of workmanship
[1:09:54] to devise cunning Works to work in gold
[1:09:56] and silver brass cutting of stones to
[1:09:59] set them and carving of Timber to work
[1:10:00] in all manner of workmanship and I
[1:10:02] behold I have given with him he know
[1:10:06] another guy so we know there's at least
[1:10:07] two folks in you right bezel and a holab
[1:10:10] the son of a a isach yeah of the tribe
[1:10:14] of Dan right why did God write that in
[1:10:17] there are we really that concerned with
[1:10:20] who helped Moses build a tabernacle
[1:10:22] right I ain't seen none of y'all not
[1:10:23] naming your children Bez and a holy AB
[1:10:26] yeah yeah but it's a point he's trying
[1:10:29] to make a point I have called by name
[1:10:31] this man to do this specific job right
[1:10:34] and he's going to need a Helper and his
[1:10:36] name is going to be a holab we're going
[1:10:38] to have Bez and holy I mean they're
[1:10:40] going to do these things because they're
[1:10:41] good at it right how many believe God
[1:10:44] would only call you for what you're good
[1:10:45] at right amen that's right oh yeah no
[1:10:48] nobody wants to think about that brother
[1:10:50] said a young man will come in and get
[1:10:52] converted one night and he'll be up
[1:10:53] wanting preach the next day and he said
[1:10:56] it don't work like that right God calls
[1:10:58] a man for what he's good at now granted
[1:11:02] some of us wander along a long time we
[1:11:04] found out what we're good at we get down
[1:11:07] to the end of our lives and we look back
[1:11:08] and we're not sure we were good at
[1:11:09] anything yeah yeah but it happens he
[1:11:12] calls a man according to his gifts right
[1:11:16] and he knows them by name Moses over
[1:11:18] there flip over to Exodus
[1:11:22] 35
[1:11:25] after God told this to Moses a few
[1:11:27] chapters later in Exodus 35 he goes over
[1:11:29] there in verse 30 and Moses said unto
[1:11:32] the children of Israel see the Lord hath
[1:11:36] called by name yeah he he was a faithful
[1:11:41] Minister God said look see I want you to
[1:11:43] know I've got these two guys and Moses
[1:11:45] said look I'm going to have these two
[1:11:47] guys do this and it ain't my choosing
[1:11:49] right the Lord has called him by name
[1:11:51] right amen but all all we we all know
[1:11:54] where this what this brother ought to be
[1:11:56] doing and that brother ought to be doing
[1:11:57] and the Lord says I know what he ought
[1:11:59] to be doing and if you don't like what
[1:12:01] he's doing you ask God about that right
[1:12:04] because that's what God told him to do
[1:12:06] right don't you see I I've known him by
[1:12:09] name it's it's that's why brother brand
[1:12:12] said one of these days we're not going
[1:12:14] to be we're not going to hear him call
[1:12:16] William brandom and it's not it's not
[1:12:18] that he said I'm not the son of Charles
[1:12:20] and El branam anymore he knows me by
[1:12:23] name amen oh Brothers it's all of Grace
[1:12:27] amen it is all of
[1:12:29] Grace it's no you're going to have Works
[1:12:32] yes James got over there and he got all
[1:12:34] confounded about what Paul said about
[1:12:35] all Grace and he said how can Grace be
[1:12:38] manifest unless we have some Works along
[1:12:39] with it and I agree with James and I
[1:12:41] agree with Peter and Paul and all the
[1:12:43] rest of them they're both right right
[1:12:46] sure it is the heart that will turn the
[1:12:48] heart will be changed and The Works will
[1:12:51] follow it the works that's sir brother
[1:12:54] said if you come up on parts of the word
[1:12:56] and you can't agree with it you're not
[1:12:57] even Abraham's seed there's proof that's
[1:13:00] why when those Jews came to him over
[1:13:02] there in the Book of John and Jesus was
[1:13:04] preaching to him and they said We
[1:13:05] believe We Believe yeah and Jesus said
[1:13:08] oh yeah you believe if you will continue
[1:13:10] in my word then are you my
[1:13:13] disciples not coming up to one part and
[1:13:15] stopping but if you continue in my word
[1:13:18] Glory then y are you my disciples indeed
[1:13:21] do you believe it's all of Grace I
[1:13:24] believe in grace so great Grace Grace
[1:13:27] God's Grace Grace that is greater than
[1:13:30] all my that's right now A man under
[1:13:33] under legalism he can't stand much grace
[1:13:35] right you know a guy under grace he can
[1:13:37] take a whole lot of legalism right but a
[1:13:39] legalist ain't going to take no Grace
[1:13:41] you know he don't believe it's nothing
[1:13:42] in Grace got to be your works and what
[1:13:44] you do but I am a Grace preacher Grace
[1:13:47] it was grace that brought Abraham along
[1:13:50] the journey and God called him and and
[1:13:54] then and then in the Easter seal brother
[1:13:56] I said when that light flashes before
[1:13:58] him when a four day Son of God sees that
[1:14:01] word of God he rises and goes to me amen
[1:14:04] brothers and sisters we're living in a
[1:14:06] day yeah I know and I got so many notes
[1:14:09] on this the seed is about run out y
[1:14:12] that's why this church ain't bigger than
[1:14:14] it is it ain't packed out it ain't
[1:14:15] thousands of people sitting in here yeah
[1:14:18] why because the the early the beginning
[1:14:20] of our Christianity started out slow and
[1:14:22] it's winding
[1:14:24] slow right I I know there's churches
[1:14:26] that are 5,000 people and 10,000 people
[1:14:29] in other countries and and God keeps the
[1:14:31] records on all of that right but brother
[1:14:34] brandham kept making those quotes over
[1:14:35] when Jesus said There Will Be Few that
[1:14:37] are saved he meant few amen he didn't
[1:14:40] mean millions and billions he meant few
[1:14:43] that's right few few it is a small
[1:14:46] number compared to the the size of the
[1:14:49] world compared to the volumes of people
[1:14:51] right that there are in this world I
[1:14:53] drove past almost all of them on my way
[1:14:55] here yeah right we sat up there on I 85
[1:14:58] the other day we were coming out of
[1:15:00] Richmond we got down the road and and
[1:15:02] the Lord is gracious to us I I want to
[1:15:04] testify this my wife and I just we
[1:15:06] hadn't been on I 85 but just a few
[1:15:08] minutes we decided it's about lunch time
[1:15:09] we'll get us a sandwich we pull off got
[1:15:12] our got our got our lunch there we was
[1:15:14] going to eat it in the car just so we
[1:15:15] could get on down here and have some
[1:15:16] more time with brother Wade and we get
[1:15:19] get in the road and we go just a few
[1:15:20] miles and we're dead stopped for over an
[1:15:22] hour right in the of I
[1:15:24] 85 if we hadn't stopped and got that
[1:15:26] lunch we'd have probably been right down
[1:15:28] there two more miles later where that
[1:15:29] car yeah and those two trucks tangled up
[1:15:33] we sat there for an hour there must have
[1:15:34] been a 100 miles of cars behind us by
[1:15:36] the time they let us get rolling wow but
[1:15:39] we just sat there stopped for an hour
[1:15:41] now you know me and and I'm so spiritual
[1:15:44] I I was sitting there just praising the
[1:15:46] Lord no I was sitting there
[1:15:49] frustrated come
[1:15:51] on yes honey let's thank the Lord that
[1:15:54] we are stopped in the road
[1:15:56] no yeah I was like all them mother
[1:15:59] drivers what's going on up there yeah
[1:16:01] get those bums out of the
[1:16:04] street come
[1:16:06] on but yet I don't know the plan of God
[1:16:08] for some reason there I was and I've had
[1:16:12] enough of brother weight already so I'm
[1:16:13] leaving tomorrow so it all worked out
[1:16:16] good it all worked out just fine amen
[1:16:20] God's plan amen whatever it is don't
[1:16:23] don't get all
[1:16:25] frustrated don't get all angry at that
[1:16:27] person that Zooms in in front of you and
[1:16:29] steals that parking spot right woo man
[1:16:33] right bro you don't need to shake no
[1:16:34] fist right or
[1:16:37] Worse don't need to do that maybe that
[1:16:40] guy they're parking by was just going to
[1:16:42] slam their car door right into them that
[1:16:44] could have been your car had they not
[1:16:46] stole it from
[1:16:48] you is that too simple is that good is
[1:16:51] that all right I remember a testimony
[1:16:54] and I'm going to share this and I'm
[1:16:55] going to quit but I remember a testimony
[1:16:57] I was hearing a man he he was in the
[1:17:00] meeting he he testified this in brother
[1:17:03] bisc Church some years ago I don't
[1:17:04] remember the man's name but he was in
[1:17:05] that meeting in Phoenix when this day
[1:17:09] the scriptures fulfilled when he was
[1:17:10] preaching birth pain ex and and he was
[1:17:13] telling this testimony and he said you
[1:17:16] know he said I'm standing in the back of
[1:17:17] the room brother brandham can't find his
[1:17:20] scripture and he says all of a sudden
[1:17:23] this Catholic priest walk up there and
[1:17:26] he's he's telling brother brandom here
[1:17:28] read it out of my
[1:17:29] book and he says I'm standing back there
[1:17:32] in the back he he he he made a motion he
[1:17:34] said I'm standing back there against the
[1:17:35] wall and I'm hitting my fist against the
[1:17:38] wall thinking why don't that Catholic
[1:17:40] priest sit down and shut up up
[1:17:42] there why that's what we would be doing
[1:17:45] what's that man doing interrupting our
[1:17:47] Prophet on a day like this he said I'm
[1:17:50] sitting back there knocking my fist
[1:17:51] against the wall and saying sit down
[1:17:53] already let him get on with his message
[1:17:56] what are you doing up there and he said
[1:17:59] a lot of us were around talking about it
[1:18:01] afterward we were frustrated that that
[1:18:03] Catholic priest would actually walk up
[1:18:05] there and hand him the book yeah yeah
[1:18:07] come on and he said it really bothered
[1:18:09] me until the next night until the next
[1:18:12] day when brother random came along and
[1:18:13] said did you see what happened last
[1:18:15] night exactly he said there he was
[1:18:17] handing him the book just like it was
[1:18:20] over there in Luke and he took the book
[1:18:22] and he sat down and this day this
[1:18:24] scripture is fulfilled that man said I
[1:18:27] felt about this tall when I heard the
[1:18:29] explanation of what God was doing
[1:18:32] because here I was all frustrated with
[1:18:33] it we want we're hot and we're sweating
[1:18:35] and we're wanting to get on with the
[1:18:36] meeting and God is fulfilling his word
[1:18:40] and I'm so un unbeknownst to the mind of
[1:18:43] God for everything around me that I
[1:18:45] don't even know what's going on but a
[1:18:47] prophet comes and tells me that's what
[1:18:49] was being done and it was done for a
[1:18:51] purpose and the Word was being being
[1:18:53] fulfilled right in front of you right
[1:18:55] and I'm standing there knocking on the
[1:18:56] wall thinking wish that Catholic preest
[1:18:59] down right we' have done the same thing
[1:19:02] that's how spiritual we are are we so
[1:19:05] spiritually in tune that we're going to
[1:19:06] know the which turn to make no we're
[1:19:09] just going to live right you know why
[1:19:11] we're just going to go out and live
[1:19:12] tomorrow because we're ordinary man
[1:19:15] right we are just right ordinary you
[1:19:18] have the musicians come let me read you
[1:19:19] a quote while they're
[1:19:21] coming
[1:19:23] just an ordinary man
[1:19:27] yeah don't forget this quote in message
[1:19:29] of Grace when Paul wrote Abraham's
[1:19:31] commentary he never mentioned one thing
[1:19:33] about Abraham's unbelief it never was
[1:19:36] even accounted to him you know why it
[1:19:38] wasn't accounted to him because when he
[1:19:40] believed and God accounted it to him for
[1:19:44] righteousness nothing else could be
[1:19:46] accounted to and if you have been
[1:19:48] accounted righteous my dear brothers and
[1:19:50] sisters there is nothing can be counted
[1:19:52] against
[1:19:53] it don't matter how many enemies rise up
[1:19:56] and point fingers at you and try to
[1:19:57] accuse the accuser of our Brethren is
[1:20:00] cast down we don't listen to him anymore
[1:20:03] he's still accusing he's still standing
[1:20:05] up he's still bringing up our flaws and
[1:20:07] our
[1:20:07] blemishes but it don't matter it don't
[1:20:10] matter oh my so many I know you want me
[1:20:12] to read all these but it's 3 3:30
[1:20:14] already so let me let me get to this one
[1:20:17] more I got to read you one
[1:20:19] more this bear with me hang on there
[1:20:23] and man look I didn't know I brought all
[1:20:25] these and I gave the guys in the bat
[1:20:28] more than
[1:20:35] this this is in that message we were
[1:20:37] telling about to Abraham and the seed
[1:20:39] after
[1:20:42] him we're going to get down on ourselves
[1:20:44] every once in a while before this
[1:20:45] journey is over sure we're going to have
[1:20:48] mistakes but the commentary the Divine
[1:20:51] commentary says you never did it
[1:20:53] right here's this is in that message
[1:20:56] Abraham in the seat after
[1:21:00] him brother BR says he's speaking as if
[1:21:02] the congregation is said well I'll tell
[1:21:04] you brother brandom I'm not worthy of
[1:21:06] healing I've just got through telling
[1:21:09] you it's nothing you've done it's what
[1:21:11] he done you keep thinking you're
[1:21:13] unworthy here he's going to give us an
[1:21:15] example of what that means to God he
[1:21:17] says here what if an old mayor back here
[1:21:18] in Bible time would have give birth to a
[1:21:21] little cult say he had a mule and the
[1:21:24] mule was born and both ears was flopped
[1:21:26] down his tail stuck straight up his eyes
[1:21:28] was crossed his knees was bowed together
[1:21:32] well if he could look in the glass and
[1:21:33] think he'd just say woe is me they'll
[1:21:35] never feed
[1:21:37] me cuz he looked so bad his ears was
[1:21:40] flopped down his tail stuck up his eyes
[1:21:42] was crossed his knees was B together
[1:21:44] he'd look in the mirror and say woe is
[1:21:45] me they'll never feed me they'll just
[1:21:47] knock me in the head when they come out
[1:21:48] and see
[1:21:49] me but what if his mother was well
[1:21:52] instructed in the law You' say wait a
[1:21:53] minute honey wait a minute I know you're
[1:21:55] a horrible looking
[1:21:56] creature you're no good but you're going
