here about the children of Israel how they complain complain complain and I also found this in the in the Spyro book but the grumblers I'm not going to read that b they say they Grumble Monday sat Sunday and Grumble and Grandma Webster said complain is to express grief pain or dis content to make a formal acquisation or charge something that is the cause or subject of protest or or outcry uh she I want to talk about the children of Israel it's a type of of of of our journey that they came out of Egypt which is a type of the world going to the promised land and uh we came out of the world into the message for our day and are going to the promised land let's go to John 14 1 to4 John 141 through four says let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mentions if it were not so I would I have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also in the massage why Christ speak brother said uh Moses was born a proper child no one else could take his place he was ordained for the job uh brother says like pre predestination he was predestined uh let's go to let's go to Exodus uh 23 232 to 24 Moses was given an angel and brother Brandon was given an angel so Exodus 23 20 to 24 behold I sent an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will bring I will be an enemy unto the enemies and adversary unto the adversaries for the Angels shall go before thee and bring the into the all the Hittites canites all good and I will cut them off so he promised that he will take care of all their enemies already thou shall not bow down to their gods nor serve them nor do after their works but thou shal utterly overthrow them and quite break down their images when the angel came to brother he told him he told him if you get the people to believe nothing will stand in your way when you pray even cancer right and your little thing right here in the numbers right at the top it says numb 14:22 because all those all those men which have seen my glory and my Miracles which I did in Egypt in the wilderness and have tempted me now these 10 times have had not hearkened to my voice actually I I was reading all over and I found more than 10 complaint but uh we're going to go with this because we probably won even have time to cover all of that let's go to uh let's start with the first complaint is Exodus 14:10 1410 to 14 Exodus 14 10 to 15 and when Pharaoh Drew nigh the children of Israel lifted up their eyes and behold the Egyptians marched after them and they were so afraid and the children of Israel cried out un to the Lord and they said unto Moses because there were no graves in Egypt that have has taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore H has thou dealt thus with us to carry us forth out of Egypt is not this the word that we had be tell thee in Egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians for it had been better for us to serve the Egyptian than that we should die in the wilderness and Moses said un to their people fear ye not stand still and see their salvation of the Lord which he will show to you today for the Egyptians you ye have seen today you shall see them again no more long forever the Lord shall fight for you and and you shall hold your peace and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore thou C th unto me speak speak unto the children of Israel that they may go forward and uh lifting him out of a history brother said uh Moses when he had who led the children of Israel Into the Wilderness and he came to the Red Sea and the mountains on the one side and the desert on the other and Pharaoh's Army this way and the Red Sea in ahead of them and they were trapped in a little net seemed like that even NE C out what's going to happen they're finished Pharaoh's Army by the tens of thousand to write them down and what did the people begin to do murmur and complain okay be be better off we stay back in our place where we were at but there was one among them those people who had the flame of God's faith burning in his heart who believed that a historical God could raise on the scene in any kind of difficult Moses stood with his hands up to God and prayed until the god of History rose on the scene to be a God in the present day and he opened the way and Israel went through the waters on dry land and the message uh while Christ speake said now you remember remember he already prophesied here for he said the the Egyptians that you see today you shall see them no more forever you'll see them no more and immediately began to cry out God what can we do see after he had done a pretty good job and in prophesying that you see he done he done told them what would happen if if the word of God was in him it was in him and and he when he was telling that actually come to pass what he said was already going to come to pass and here he was crying out what am I going to do so Moses did cry too like everybody else did uh number two Exodus 15 23- 26 and when they came to Maria they could not drink of the water of Maria for they were bitter therefore the name of it was called Mara and the people murmur against Moses saying what shall we drink and he cried unto the Lord and the Lord showed him a tree which he had cast into the waters the waters were made sweet there he made for them a statue and an ordance and there he proved to them and he said thou will delinquently harden to the voice of the Lord thy God and will do that which is right in his sight and will give you here to his Commandments and gave all his statutes I will put n these diseases upon thee which I have had brought upon the Egyptians for I am the Lord that Health thee Amen on the bottom of my Scorpio Bible it says uh this uh bitter Waters were in the very path of the Lord's leading and stand for the trials of God's people which are Ed ucat and not putative the tree is a cross which became sweet to the to Christ as the expression of the father's will when our Mars are so taken we cast the tree into the waters let's go to Exodus 16 1 to 3 and they took their Journey from Ila and all the congregation of children of Israel came into the Wilderness of s which is between Elam and Si on the 15th day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt and the whole Congregation of children Israel murmur against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness and the children of Israel said unto them W to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt when we said by the flesh pots and when we did eat bread to the F for ye have brought us forth into this Wilderness to kill this whole assembly with Hunger then said the Lord unto Moses behold I will rain bread from heaven for you and the people shall go go out and gather a certain rate every day that I may prove to them whether they will walk in my law or no and it shall come to pass that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily and Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel at even then you shall know that the Lord had brought you out from the land of Egypt and in the morning then you shall see the glory of the Lord for that he heard heard your murmurings against the Lord and what are we that you should murmur against us and Moses said this shall be when the Lord shall give you in the evening flesh to eat and in the morning bread to the full for the Lord had heard your murmurings which you murmur against him and what are we you murmurings are not against us but against the Lord and Moses spake unto Aaron saying say onto all the congregation the children of Israel come near before the Lord for he had heard your murmurs and it came to pass as Aaron spake unto the whole Congregation of children of Israel that they look toward the Wilderness and behold the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud and the Lord spake unto Moses saying I heard the murmurings of the children of Israel be come to them saying at even you shall eat flesh in the morning you shall be filled with bread and you shall know that I'm the Lord your God and it came to pass at the evening the quills came up and covered the camp and in the morning the D lay around but about the host number four is uh Exodus 19:21 it talks about uh when they're Gathering the Mana they uh they disobey Moses to to leave leave leave none until morning and Moses was was was Wrath and so and and the Mana Brew worms and and snuck let's go to number seven which is uh says 32 and when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mouth the people gather themselves together unto Aaron and said unto him make us Gods we shall go before us for as for this Moses the man that brought us out of the land of Egypt we will not what it become of him and Aaron said unto them break off the Golden Earrings which are in the ears of your wives of your sons and of your daughters and bring them unto me and the people broke off the earrings which were in their ears and brought them unto Aaron and he received them at their hand and fasten with a grave to after he made it a molded a calf and they said these be thy Gods oh Israel which brought the up out of the land of Egypt and when Aaron saw it he built an altar for an Aaron made Proclaim and said to tomorrow is a feast to the Lord and they rose up early in the morning Morrow and offer burnt offerings and brought peace offerings and the people sat down to eat to drink and Rose up to play right and the Lord said unto Moses go get the down for thy people which thou has brought out of the land of Egypt have corrupted themselves they have turned aside quickly out of the way which commanded them that they have made the mo calf and have worshiped it and have sacrificed there unto and said the these be thy gods of Israel which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt and the Lord said unto Moses I have seen these people and behold as a stiff neck people now therefore let me alone that my WRA May wax heart against them and that I may consume them and I will make thee of every nation let's go to numbers uh 12 1 to 3 15 now Moses didn't have enough problems with two million people complaining his brother and a sister complain too and miror and AR SP against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married for he had married an Ethiopian woman and they said had the Lord indeed spoke only by Moses had he not spoken also by us and the Lord heard it and now the man Moses was very Meek above all the men which were upon the face of the earth and the Lord spake s suddenly unto Moses and Aaron and unto Mir Come Ye the three unto to the Tabernacle of the congregation and they three came out and the L and the Lord came and uh came down in the pillar of the cloud and stood in the door of the Tabernacle and called Aaron and mirin and they both came forth and he said hear now my words if there be a prophet among you I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and I will speak unto him in a dream my servant Moses is not so who is faithful in all my house with him will I speak mouth to mouth even apparently not in dark speeches and in similitude of the Lord shall he behold where or then we then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses and the anger of the Lord was kindled against them and he departed and the cloud departed from off the Tabernacle and behold mirian became lepos white as snow and Aaron looked upon Miran and behold she Le and Aaron said unto Moses all my Lord I beseech thee lay not the sin upon us where we have done foolishly and when we have sinned let her not be one as dead of whom the Flesh and is half consumed when he come out of his mother's womb and Moses Cried unto the Lord cry cry cry cry and Moses Cried unto the Lord saying heal her now oh Lord I beseech thee and the Lord said unto Moses if her father has spit it in her face should she not be ashamed seven days let her not be shut out let her be shut out from the camp 7even days and after that let her be received in the C again and Mary was shut out of the from the camp 7even days and the people Journey not till Maran was brought in again so they they stopped for seven days because of Maran oh yeah seven days all all those people because of one lady no wonder it took them 40 years didn't say just the women M no B brother in the in the message I think is the children of Israel even bam got in there he said uh look at here the children of Israel did this and that children surely a holy God would have to curse that people like that but he failed to see that SM smitten Rock the Brazen serpent the atonement that forgave their sins he also said uh today no matter what the church does has done the atonement the blood of Jesus Christ still atones for our sins he also says that talking to Moses he said God gave you the promise that the healing your healing your health the Holy Spirit but you have to fight for it he said you might have to cut through the Methodist Baptist pres and so on he said don't bow down to their gods it's yours take it I get this right here you guys will probably like this uni in time and and uni in time and sign

our Southern expression aggravated him just constantly kept him on the move everything with a murmur or a complaint and so forth but Moses when he come to The Showdown when God said separate yourself from them because I'm going to take you and start a new nation Moses threw himself on the path of God's bre said take me and not the people that he called Rebels rebellions against God and against him yet he loved them so much till he said take me and save them that was Christ and Moses amen thank you call for looking at me like it wasn't me first out
