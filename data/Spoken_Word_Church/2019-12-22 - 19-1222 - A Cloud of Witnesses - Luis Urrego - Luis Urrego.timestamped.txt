[0:11] good restful week we are we got it sound
[0:14] all week so usually usually during this
[0:19] time we're all doing some sort of
[0:20] mission trip and I decided to stay home
[0:24] stay stay here and we just do a little
[0:28] cabin we just don't stay there all week
[0:30] long up in Franklin North Carolina I
[1:08] wish everybody oh oh good Christmas and
[1:11] a good
[1:12] it's just rest just take a break and
[1:14] enjoy yourself prepare yourself not just
[1:17] physically enjoy everybody that you that
[1:20] sometimes we just take for granted and
[1:22] we don't we don't not just enjoy this
[1:25] because tomorrow they may be gone
[1:32] but Lord willing next year early full
[1:35] steam ahead we've got to mission trips
[1:38] planned Philippines Costa Rica Nicaragua
[1:41] and Honduras again and so y'all pray for
[1:45] us because there's so much work to be
[1:48] done so many people that need to work so
[1:52] but then this morning we want to talk
[1:56] about this is gonna be a little
[1:57] scattered this morning and I do
[1:59] apologize for this but I think it just
[2:03] though I think it's appropriate in this
[2:06] in this time you know - well I want to
[2:09] talk I want to talk this morning and I
[2:10] should have shown a picture but however
[2:14] oh they don't know what this magazine is
[2:16] right now each and every one of us knows
[2:19] what magazine this don't want to talk a
[2:22] little bit about this you know this this
[2:24] particular oh yeah image and a lot of
[2:29] people they look at this they look at
[2:32] this page and they read what what what
[2:34] took place here but never never stopping
[2:38] to think what's on the other side what's
[2:41] on the other page and this right here is
[2:44] very significant it goes along exactly
[2:47] with this now I want I want to I want to
[2:49] just talk about that whole we'll talk
[2:52] about it yes Lord well and when I'll
[2:54] come back and everything I want to have
[2:56] a full sermon about it this is just
[2:58] little bits and pieces here in there but
[3:00] that cloud to me Saints is a it was a
[3:05] token for each and or one of us it's not
[3:08] what saves us right right but it is a
[3:11] sign so for example you know if I give
[3:15] if I give you know let's say brother
[3:17] brother brother Bob gives me this phone
[3:21] and I've done this example before this
[3:24] is a sign you see it's a token that he
[3:29] appreciates me it's a gift that you gave
[3:31] to me right but really every time I look
[3:35] at this phone it's it's you know it
[3:38] should take me back to the giver
[3:41] you see what I'm saying right I think a
[3:44] lot of people a couple of months ago I
[3:46] preached the message about the token and
[3:48] I talked about the relics and things
[3:50] like that and I think some people
[3:51] misunderstood me
[3:52] and the thing is is that a relic is
[3:56] something that you look at for salvation
[3:58] yeah see and it shouldn't be that way
[4:02] all right
[4:03] see for example when I take this phone
[4:06] that brother Bob gave me this should
[4:09] take me back to the giver you see what
[4:11] I'm saying this is not what I worship
[4:14] right this is not what I this is not the
[4:18] token is the the relic is not what I
[4:22] worship our worship is the one that gave
[4:24] me the right you see and the word relic
[4:27] isn't something bad the word relic is
[4:29] something that that that means it's a
[4:31] sign you see a sign that should take you
[4:34] to the to the main source when I look at
[4:37] you know a sign that says Albuquerque
[4:40] New Mexico 40 miles 45 miles ahead well
[4:43] that sign is not Albuquerque New Mexico
[4:45] Albuquerque New Mexico is further on and
[4:49] I think that's where a lot of people
[4:50] misunderstood me in that but I wanted to
[4:52] kind of clear that up and so that's the
[4:54] exact same thing about this cloud this
[4:57] cloud wasn't oh because I have a picture
[5:00] of a cloud I'm a message believer know a
[5:03] lot of people that had the cloud in
[5:05] their churches and in their homes and
[5:06] things like that and still don't
[5:08] understand or do not believe the message
[5:11] because the message is Christ the cloud
[5:15] is just a symbol it's a token Amen it's
[5:19] a sign about things that really really
[5:23] uh vindicating things in the scripture
[5:27] but really that cloud was also for
[5:29] brother branham as well because it it
[5:32] was a thing for him to go back east
[5:34] which was jefferson bill to preach the
[5:36] seals but to us as the Bride of Christ
[5:39] and that's a sign for us so throughout
[5:42] all these scriptures you see where God
[5:43] used clouds God used God use clouds
[5:48] one of the scriptures here that I was
[5:49] looking at where it is in Genesis
[5:51] chapter 9 verse 13 and you seen him God
[5:55] told no other and he said I don't think
[5:59] it's gonna see verse yes
[6:01] verse 12 not in 12 I don't know if you
[6:04] can see that or not see if I can make it
[6:07] bigger yes
[6:11] and God said this is the token of the
[6:14] Covenant which I make between me and you
[6:17] see he said a token and God said this is
[6:22] the token of the Covenant which I meant
[6:24] between me and you and every living
[6:26] creature that is with you for perpetual
[6:28] generations verse 13 I do set my bow in
[6:32] the cloud and it shall be for a token of
[6:37] a covenant between me and the earth now
[6:39] wherever there's usually a cloud in the
[6:41] in descriptors there's always a bow
[6:43] attached to it and what is that boat
[6:47] well it's a rainbow
[6:48] praise the Lord by the way yes there is
[6:54] a bow attached to it alright so and he
[7:00] continues here and it shall come to pass
[7:01] when I bring a cloud over the earth that
[7:03] the bow shall be seen in the cloud as
[7:09] interesting where's third verse fourteen
[7:13] all right we look at like I said you
[7:17] know this is kind of kind of scattered
[7:21] but
[7:28] let's see here let's look at I'm looking
[7:35] at it in the New Testaments I found some
[7:38] it's a pretty good image now in
[7:43] mountainous figuration
[7:46] when Jesus went up with the disciples
[7:48] there was a cloud that was in on the
[7:52] mountain that took that took them up you
[7:54] see in verse chapter 17 verse 5 he yet
[7:59] spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed
[8:00] them and behold a voice out of the cloud
[8:03] which said this is my beloved Son in
[8:05] whom I am well pleased
[8:07] - llúria him mark 9 7 and there was a
[8:10] cloud that overshadowed them and the
[8:13] voice came out of the cloud saying this
[8:15] is my beloved son and hear him alright
[8:19] Luke 9 34 while he does spank there came
[8:22] a cloud and overshadowed them and they
[8:24] feared as they entered into the cloud
[8:28] that's kind of interesting
[8:43] so I don't mess the place here but
[8:47] anyways anywhere in the scriptures where
[8:50] usually we're talking about clout it's
[8:54] when God when God involves a cloud in
[8:57] any sort of ministry and you see it in
[8:58] Moses ministry there was a cloud up on
[9:01] the mountain now that the Bible says if
[9:03] you read there in Exodus I believe is
[9:05] Exodus chapter 20 and I want to get into
[9:07] more detail with this and maybe in
[9:09] another sermon but when Moses entered
[9:13] into that cloud
[9:15] he saw the cloud right he was in that
[9:17] cloud but the people down at the bottom
[9:19] of the mountain also saw the cloud and
[9:22] they feared and they wondered where as
[9:25] Moses gonna die where is he going to
[9:27] come back is what's going on but there
[9:31] was a cloud involved in the in the
[9:33] ministry and the same thing with this
[9:35] with our day if God had a ministry like
[9:39] the prop of the minute the ministry of
[9:41] brother branham prophet - to vindicate
[9:45] revelations 10-7 Malachi 4 5 & 6 but
[9:49] i'ma tell you Saints if if it wasn't
[9:51] brother Branham and the life that
[9:52] brother Branham live then tell me who is
[9:57] then right then we are still living
[10:00] within those industries those versatile
[10:04] not vindicated yet in other words you
[10:07] see then that means we're waiting for
[10:10] somebody else so if it wasn't in the
[10:13] life of brother Branham then who was you
[10:16] see so in the same thing God had to use
[10:20] the same patterns from the Old Testament
[10:22] in the New Testament the scripture he
[10:24] had to use the same patterns in this day
[10:26] in order to vindicate the the Word of
[10:29] God to us amen praise the Lord so so I
[10:34] want to show you guys the love you may
[10:35] have seen this
[10:36] before hopefully I can bring it up
[10:50] all right so in this day and age we have
[10:56] we have the iCloud or the cloud and I
[11:03] mean if the cloud isn't a big deal the
[11:05] natural types of spirituous yeah you see
[11:07] we're living in the age of cloud
[11:09] technology very information what is the
[11:12] cloud all right
[11:14] the cloud right now is it lists us
[11:18] speaking naturally what the cloud is is
[11:21] anything that you have any files audio
[11:25] services of any sort
[11:29] you know documents or anything that you
[11:32] can have on a local computer it can be
[11:35] synced to a server that's out there
[11:40] somewhere somewhere else they call it
[11:42] the cloud but it's somewhere else most
[11:45] of us don't even know where it is but
[11:49] you have access to it you see other
[11:56] people but that's the reason why they
[11:57] have to password protect the things and
[11:59] stuff like that they have to have a
[12:00] certain amount of security to go along
[12:03] with it now so what they're saying is
[12:05] you don't have to have everything are in
[12:08] a physical computer see we're used to
[12:11] everything being a little in a physical
[12:13] hard drive and I have my music in the
[12:16] physical hard drive I have my music all
[12:18] stored locally to a computer but those
[12:21] times are earth they're getting away
[12:25] more and more for you to be able to have
[12:28] access to access just physical things
[12:30] they're trying to put everything up in
[12:33] the cloud so that you can access it from
[12:35] anywhere in the world now you take that
[12:38] for example take that with God now
[12:41] remember God was the one who originally
[12:43] created the he was the one he was the
[12:46] first iCloud service
[12:49] he was the first cloud service you know
[12:51] brother Graham said that when they sent
[12:54] a man to space you know that they said
[12:58] well that's that's wonderful
[12:59] but we've had a man in space for 2,000
[13:01] years and prayer was the first you know
[13:07] Wi-Fi connection for us you see now I
[13:10] speak in these lean goes even further
[13:12] that Bob knows what I'm talking about
[13:13] some of you know what I'm talking about
[13:14] because this is what we deal with every
[13:16] day you know we deal with these things
[13:18] and so but it's interesting that that I
[13:23] cloud the cloud and all these things
[13:25] syncs all these items in and the same
[13:27] thing with this with this cloud all
[13:30] right the cloud which is let's just say
[13:34] it's God the only way that you can
[13:36] connect to it is by faith you sink your
[13:41] sink to it by faith in other words you
[13:43] look at his word and you say Lord I
[13:46] believe it that settles it in my heart
[13:48] and you watch that cloud or you watch
[13:50] God amen on the scene and fulfill that
[13:52] word in your life for whatever need that
[13:55] you may have no matter where you're at
[13:58] I can I can put something here on my on
[14:02] my tablet in into the cloud all right
[14:06] it's it's a space I don't know I don't
[14:08] know where the the main server is I just
[14:11] know that it's there in the same thing
[14:14] with us with God I don't know where
[14:15] where he where he is as far as I just
[14:19] know that he's there I just know that
[14:21] he's living in me I just know that he's
[14:23] working in my heart I have a connection
[14:24] with him you see and and I can put
[14:27] something there in the cloud tomorrow I
[14:29] can be in the Philippines and I can
[14:31] access that in the cloud I don't have to
[14:34] access the physical computer that I that
[14:36] I uploaded it from back in in Winder
[14:39] Georgia no because it's in the cloud you
[14:42] see it's all there all the promises that
[14:44] he gave us amen
[14:46] they're all there and to access them
[14:49] wherever your our act we serve an
[14:52] ever-present
[14:54] and the time of trouble I see so in
[14:57] Hebrews 2:12 1 it says wherefore seeing
[15:00] we also are compassed about with so
[15:02] great a cloud of witnesses in other
[15:06] words it's interesting that it uses the
[15:08] cloud of witnesses or in other words
[15:11] like a token a sign a cloud a sign you
[15:15] see let us lay aside every weight in the
[15:18] sin which that's so easily beset us and
[15:20] let us run with patience the race that
[15:23] is set before us
[15:24] you know today sinking things on the
[15:28] cloud as a matter of fact what you're
[15:30] seeing right now I do not have it on
[15:32] this lap on this iPad physically you're
[15:36] singing this document from the cloud I
[15:41] have what's called Dropbox and
[15:44] everything's synced in the cloud and I
[15:47] just put stuff in there whenever I'm
[15:49] working for example on the podcast that
[15:52] I work all my files you go to this cloud
[15:55] and I can work on my podcast over the
[15:57] radio program anywhere in the world
[16:00] because all of my files are stored right
[16:02] there so so this this this up what was I
[16:08] to say with that so it's an easy thing
[16:12] it's an easy thing why if we're not
[16:16] using it it's it becomes so simple that
[16:23] there should not be any excuse in other
[16:25] words to not use it so that's what in
[16:27] other words that's what God is trying to
[16:29] tell us here let us lay aside the
[16:32] weights and the sins that so easily
[16:34] besides in other words Christ has
[16:38] already done the heavy work for you him
[16:42] the cloud it's already doing the heavy
[16:45] work for you you don't have to push
[16:48] yourself to to to serve you know to do
[16:52] this that are the other to forgive I've
[16:54] always said there's nothing I can do you
[16:57] fell
[16:57] there's nothing not going to do to to
[17:00] merit God's forgiveness there's nothing
[17:03] I can do to to forgive my own sins to
[17:08] erase my own saying there's nothing
[17:10] right so why feel bad about the things
[17:14] sometimes we fail and we make mistakes
[17:15] why feel bad why feel condemned about
[17:18] those things when you know you can't
[17:20] even do anything about it the cloud is
[17:22] already taking care of it
[17:25] do you see what I'm trying to say in
[17:28] other words God has already taken care
[17:30] of it
[17:30] Jesus Christ has already taken up the
[17:32] heavy work for you for YouTube to to
[17:35] fret to fear the only one that can bring
[17:38] condemnation in your life is Satan the
[17:41] Bible says now there is now no
[17:44] condemnation to who to those that are in
[17:49] Christ Jesus
[17:50] hello you asked my you ask yourself am I
[17:53] in Christ Jesus
[17:54] it's Christ Jesus in me because there he
[17:58] is and then you if you abide in him and
[17:59] he abides in you then there should not
[18:01] be any condemnation sure we were gonna
[18:03] make mistakes sure we're gonna fail you
[18:06] Eve until we get these bodies redeemed
[18:08] we're gonna fail him and make lots of
[18:10] mistakes we're gonna lose our temper
[18:12] we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna say
[18:14] things we shouldn't say we're gonna
[18:15] we're gonna do those things those things
[18:17] are gonna happen but a Christian will
[18:21] quickly recognize I shouldn't have said
[18:23] that
[18:23] right I shouldn't have acted that way I
[18:26] shouldn't have done that right away
[18:29] quickly and if something's not there to
[18:32] cause that in your life and something
[18:34] wrong right you need to you need to have
[18:37] some access to the cloud you see you
[18:41] need to have some access to that - that
[18:44] means we need to be born again we need
[18:48] amen first Thessalonians chapter 4 verse
[18:52] 17 then we which are alive and remain
[18:54] shall be caught up together with them in
[18:56] the clouds see there's clouds involved
[19:00] there again to meet the Lord in the air
[19:02] and so shall we ever be with the Lord
[19:05] now so this right here is talking about
[19:10] everything that I just told you that you
[19:12] can sink everything to the cloud brother
[19:15] Branham says now here he says while in
[19:18] him and being in him you have access to
[19:21] everything he died for God's chosen
[19:25] plate that I was in God's relationship I
[19:28] said you in Christ and Christ in you you
[19:31] have access to everything all right so
[19:35] there's nothing there's nothing that
[19:38] doesn't that you are you and I should
[19:42] love it should be laughing and if we
[19:44] don't receive it's because we don't
[19:47] receive ways because we are we don't
[19:50] receive in faith we don't ask you don't
[19:52] ask you will not receive you don't see
[19:56] you will not fine but jesus said asking
[20:01] you show to see seeping yourself father
[20:03] not can you shall be opened unto you
[20:06] every promise that God has made for you
[20:09] is there just get the password of faith
[20:14] access okay
[20:15] and enjoy share it with others
[20:19] amen so that they can benefit as well
[20:27] yes so now I'm getting ready to I'm
[20:29] getting ready to talk about that all
[20:33] right so in this cloud here we know what
[20:37] the what the cloud here is this is the
[20:39] original picture right of course brother
[20:41] Branham he was told he was told to turn
[20:44] it sideways and it had the the uh look
[20:48] like Hoffman's head of Christ to him
[20:50] right very interesting because it also
[20:53] goes well with the wagged one that the
[20:56] Bible talked about you know and they're
[20:59] just different things and I'm not going
[21:00] to go on to all the details maybe in
[21:02] another sermon but but if you could take
[21:06] a look at this magazine and if you hold
[21:09] this up to the light on the other side
[21:11] you got this rainbow
[21:13] now what did revelation 10:1 say in
[21:17] Revelations 10:1 that says that one came
[21:19] down from heaven a mighty angel came
[21:21] down to heaven with a cloud and a
[21:23] rainbow over his head
[21:24] and you see and you see if you hold this
[21:27] to the light
[21:31] if you hold this to the light now this
[21:34] is this is - this is to show that this
[21:37] was not put the brother branham was not
[21:39] in a conspiracy with Life magazine to
[21:42] put this together
[21:43] you see if you hold this to the light if
[21:46] you hold this to the light you can see
[21:47] the rainbow right above the cloud now
[21:52] that wasn't just put there just to be
[21:54] put there and it's on a Life magazine
[21:57] called life right that you know you see
[22:02] now let me show you the picture here of
[22:04] the rainbow because it talks about
[22:07] rainbow of moonbeams alright this
[22:11] curving gracefully over the lights of
[22:13] the island of Oahu this is in Hawaii
[22:15] this took place in Hawaii now Hawaii is
[22:18] the 50th state 50 is an important number
[22:24] thank God
[22:26] 50th state of the United States a moon
[22:31] made rainbow the moon types the bride
[22:35] right a mum made rainbow painted the
[22:39] Hawaiian sky with a rare rare light now
[22:42] also the city where this took place
[22:44] where this picture was taken
[22:46] was taken it was in the city it was in
[22:48] Oahu and Oahu if you look at the meaning
[22:52] of the word Oahu it means they gather
[22:54] anyplace
[22:55] oh there's their spies no that's for for
[23:00] I'm sorry no five nine out forth one two
[23:04] three four it's for Allah says your moon
[23:08] rainbows are hardly ever seen or
[23:11] photographed so this is this is a
[23:15] rainbow caused by by the moon they
[23:19] require a very special combination of
[23:22] frequent local rain showers and
[23:24] especially clear atmosphere but for this
[23:29] remarkable picture taken at 11 o clock
[23:34] Life Magazine is the one that says it
[23:37] yeah there was a brilliant moon behind
[23:40] the camera and the rainstorm in front of
[23:43] it so we have rainstorms in our lives
[23:46] but we have the light of God reflected
[23:49] to should be reflected through our life
[23:51] Honolulu and the punchbowl cemetery are
[23:54] on the horizon at left I'm here part of
[23:57] the Mount
[23:58] Tantalus shows at the right the
[24:00] raindrops broke up the moonlight into
[24:02] the spectrum of color in the sky and
[24:06] photographer Warner's story was was at
[24:10] just right place was at just the right
[24:12] place between the moon and rain to show
[24:15] the wonder of a moonstruck storm all
[24:18] right and then of course then you go to
[24:22] the other side and they have this and
[24:24] the high cloud ring of mystery the
[24:28] mystery what is the mystery in this hour
[24:32] there's a boggle set
[24:34] what's the greatest mystery there Christ
[24:37] in you the hope of course so you know
[24:40] Saint I don't think those things are
[24:41] there just to be there that's very
[24:46] interesting that that that's article and
[24:49] right before that I was I was talking to
[24:57] brother Michael Teague last Sunday and
[25:00] we were talking about that and of course
[25:02] it brings up the fact that on the cover
[25:05] of this magazine and it also has
[25:06] Rockefeller marrying his his wife so
[25:12] whoever where that is I don't know but
[25:15] it's interesting to husband and a wife
[25:18] yeah taking place I'm like the bride you
[25:21] know and then there's also something
[25:23] regarding a man who went 22 times around
[25:27] in space around 22 time zone around the
[25:33] earth and then talk so you know we're
[25:36] and that talks about countdown you know
[25:38] my brother Brown preached countdown you
[25:40] know this is 19600 our book it's May 17
[25:47] 1963 now Lord Weiland I'm like I'd like
[25:54] to preach a little a little bit more on
[25:56] that but but there's other things that
[25:58] go down and the fact that it's that the
[26:01] picture was taken on February 28 1962 or
[26:08] 1963 February 28 28 is a very important
[26:14] numbering in gods in gods numerology 28
[26:17] days is the cycle of a woman
[26:19] you see so it all ties back to the
[26:23] brothers crest so if that if that if
[26:25] that cloud was not for us and you know
[26:30] then then then tell me what what it was
[26:33] it had explained to me because even in
[26:35] that same article that Charles McDonald
[26:38] he says he said the circle was too high
[26:42] to be made by a jet plane and so far as
[26:44] dr. McDonough they determined there were
[26:46] no Rockets rocket planes or bombs being
[26:49] tested nearby that day so so it's very
[26:56] significant any questions any comments
[26:59] before we before we stop I've just
[27:08] happened that maybe somebody else may
[27:11] have preached above that I know there
[27:13] were brother Chad lamb up in Ohio a
[27:16] couple of years ago he preached a
[27:17] wonderful message regarding that cloud
[27:20] yeah and he took every single type from
[27:23] that from that event to prove that it
[27:26] wasn't a fake as they say that that it
[27:30] is and but I was looking at this
[27:35] magazine with my wife a couple of months
[27:37] ago and I was just reading that article
[27:41] my goodness it was taken at 11 o'clock
[27:44] at night it was taken in Hawaii the 50th
[27:47] state it was take it was it was a it was
[27:50] taken in Oahu and I looked up what Oahu
[27:52] mains it means the Gathering Place and
[27:55] Hawaii I think the Hawaii also has a
[27:58] meeting as well something something
[28:00] spiritual as well he didn't remember
[28:02] right at the top of my head so God's
[28:05] gonna have a witness I guess actually
[28:09] the covers fallin off
[28:11] I gotta tape it tape it on the inside
[28:19] place of the gods
[28:21] Hawaiian's place of the place of the
[28:24] gods then the Bible says you are guards
[28:29] right the hawai means place of the gods
[28:33] oh the Bible says you know ye are gods
[28:37] you wear too little we're little
[28:38] creators that's what for the RAM you
[28:40] said right
[28:42] so God bless you all whether it be nice
[28:44] if you take a picture of both pages this
[28:47] was that moment you're preaching
[28:59] actually what I'm gonna do there's I
[29:02] think online there's already an image a
[29:04] digital image now I'll just put put it
[29:07] I'm gonna put it on the screen thank you
[29:10] yes
[29:14] any other comments questions I like one
[29:17] more minute yes sister about how that
[29:23] everything we were seeing was in a cloud
[29:26] it wasn't on there but yeah I thought I
[29:30] wonder if you could type that some way
[29:32] that being a conduit that's a little bit
[29:40] and that conduit would be would be
[29:42] prayer yeah thank you have the tool of
[29:45] prayer the tool of prayer in order to
[29:47] access God's promises but yeah
[29:50] absolutely right
[29:51] may God bless you all
[29:55] [Music]
[30:03] thank you
