TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] i want to see amen praise the lord let's see him this morning shall we amen you really want to see the lord amen does everybody really want to see the lord well just turn to your side and shake your brother or sister's hand because that's the plan of god to see the lord in your brothers and sisters which are his attributes his children god bless you my friend amen we're dawning god bless your friend thank you man love you too oh it's so good to be here i i i don't if i had a home away from home there you go buddy this would be it yeah that's right this would be it we sure love you all and we just appreciate the lord i want to thank of course brother samuel for inviting us and and then and then uh putting up with us there at the little camp out i really enjoyed that i'll tell you that i do want to thank you brother wade for doing all the work cooking the food the brothers helped but brother wade was right there with his sleeves rolled up and having a good time i want to thank the church thank you all for providing for such a nice time and for letting us be here with you and happy father's day to all your fathers it is a real privilege to be of course a father it's part of the plan of god and then to have brother ronnie here and his wife elise and the family it's wonderful my wife texted me just a minute ago and said please please greet the church and she loves to come and be with you it just didn't work out this time but by the grace of god the next time that we come she'll be with me amen you love the lord amen i know you do but let's get into the message if we could this morning um you know i'm i'm gonna quit saying that i'm not long-winded because i've been coming long-winded but not not like some but uh and this and this uh message this morning uh it in a roundabout way it's a father's day message uh i was i was meditating on on what the lord would be pleased for me to bring and it just seemed like it kept rolling back to a series that i had just got done with at home uh and i entitled the series the dragon slayers today they want to train a dragon but the bride of christ destroys the dragon amen we train we train the dragon to be in the bottomless pit for a thousand years that's how this works the beast at the beginning and the beast at the end and the death of a star those are the titles that i give the message at home and the last one is the war in heaven was not with sticks and stones it was not with swords and knives and guns and balls and chains it was with words so if you would take your bible and turn with me to revelations chapter 12. we'll just get rolling this morning if we could uh brother samuel didn't have any idea what i was going to bring and what was in my notes but boy we were talking about these things last night brother samuel he's just opened up and i tried to be as quiet as i could uh because we were talking about uh judgment we were talking about angels we were talking about the judgment seat of christ and and lo and behold this morning that's not part of the message when you've got revelations 12 say amen we'll just start reading from verse one you know you could read the whole chapter and we'll read bits and pieces of it throughout the message but let's start with verse one and there appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars and she being with child cried travailing in birth and pained to be delivered and there appeared another wonder in heaven and behold a great read the copycat a great and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his heads and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and it cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born and she brought forth a man-child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up unto god and to his throne and the woman fled into the wilderness where she hath a place prepared of god that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and three score days and that is how long that's three and a half years if you use the jewish calendar and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels you know why it says it like that because his angels fight amongst one another also and prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and i heard a voice a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our god day and night let's pray father we're so thankful lord for the reading of your word and we're asking now father as you had given it to us under inspiration that you would permit it father to flow out this morning lord from my mouth use this vessel lord i pray to speak to your children lord and all that will listen let it be your word and only your word father let it be received unto the inspiration it was given lord for he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches we're so thankful we're so grateful we ask for your help and your guidance now in the precious and the lovely and the wonderful name the name given above every name lord the lord jesus christ we pray amen god bless you may be seated it's a like i say it's a real joy to be here with you this morning and uh and i'm just i'm just thankful and thankful so we can see now now i i i got i'm going to tell you where i got the inspiration for this if it's all right i'm going to take my time if that's okay i don't want to put you to sleep but you know uh the the the the world the cosmos and everybody that's living in it and on it uh has sort of been in lockdown now of course we realized that that started at the somewhere near the beginning of of last year what a lot of people don't realize that this thing that they're giving the title coveted and coron coronavis has been around for since the fall did you know that it's not new but what happened was uh people that believed that they had been given the authority and by the way they were unauthorized to break into god's laboratory and to start messing around thought that they could put together something that they could use to control the people now did that work out they almost got it done i mean really they are controlling a lot more people than they were before the virus was let out now when i'm speaking to you this morning i want you to understand i am not demeaning or impugning anybody's faith um of course we lost loved ones due to this catastrophe this plague the the virus and so forth uh because it was uh something that satan of course here uh is is trying to employ to take away the authority of god and his word and i'm going to tell you how he's trying to take that away he's trying to take that away he can't take it from god i think maybe we heard that in bible study this morning can't take it from god but he's trying to destroy the heritage of god the attributes of god the children the brothers and sisters that make up that heritage you see he can't touch god but he thinks he can get us right i got news for him because michael and his angels fought amen now you might say well that was something that happened in heaven well if you'll read your bible you'll find out that that war that started in heaven got thrown down here to the earth which really if you really understand god's word makes it much better yeah it's very difficult to fight an enemy you cannot see amen right amen just like people find it hard to serve a god they cannot see but here we are in the tangible in the three-dimensional and i don't know whether you realize it or not but we're in war yeah this is not a picnic this is not a cake walk there's a young lady at our home church that asked me about getting baptized a few weeks ago so i decided to speak on it last sunday and i said sis i know your desires to get baptized and we're all for you but let me tell you something the war is going to start as soon as you come up out of that water let me tell you this is not a cakewalk this is not a picnic this is a battle but we're equipped for this battle god would not put us out on the battlefield without the tools to implement not just a fight but victory we will be victorious because he is victorious you love him amen so i got this inspiration and i know this sounds strange but i'll just be real honest and blunt while i was at some camp meetings tent meetings i guess you'd say in virginia here a couple months ago brother sean martin put those on and his congregation and they were wonderful i noticed something though that i hadn't noticed in years been many years since i noticed it because people were they were locked down and they were caged up and they were they were they were bound well there was a freedom there that i had not seen in years and and what really got a hold of me was the fact that the lord began to deal with me and speak with me about how that we're in a battle and that he's going to try to keep us captive he's going to try to keep us bound but we know that the message of the hour tells us that he did have the holy spirit can you imagine this now imagine this statement that the devil had the holy spirit bound well the devil really didn't wasn't the one responsible for binding the holy spirit the devil was the one responsible for bringing god's children into bondage and by that he could bind the holy spirit from working amen through god's heritage so god decided it was time and in the 20th century he allowed a man to be born amen and that he was going to use for one purpose and that purpose was to give freedom amen right amen to the heritage of god that man's name was william mariam branham now the the words that we have in our end time message as we call it and as we've come to know it are not the words that's right of william mary and branham amen get that straight right now this morning they are the words of god through the man we do not lift the man up we lift the god in the man up i want you to get that because it's going to become important when you're in battle it's not you doing the fighting god said step aside children right if you believe me i will fight your battles for you and they will be victorious every time but you see you have to have the right attitude in honor of brother ernie villanueva and the thousands of quotes and cliches that came out of his mouth which were wonderful the one that comes to me and stays with me most often is your attitude determines your altitude now we live in the age where we believe in a rapture and we've been given uh the information from god through the prophet that in this age there is a requirement that was not required of any other age and that requirement was rapturing faith it he said it will take greater faith can you imagine we look back at the patriarchs in the old testament beginning with noah and then in the enoch and then and then and then abraham and moses and and and isaiah and you just go down the line and daniel and and the three hebrew children and and the disciples and we say wow man did they have a tremendous amount of faith and they're looking at us today going yeah come on come on you can do it come on because you are causing us listen now to be imperfect because they without us cannot be made perfect do you see the responsibility that lays upon our shoulders brothers and sisters that's why we're not playing church this is not this is not a religious ceremony these are the words of the living god mandated to become manifest in somebody's life why not you amen it could be you this morning you say you don't understand brother i oh i understand i'm in the same battle you're in it's the greatest battle ever fought and the way that i like to say it not to take away from the title that the prophet gave but after you study what he said it's the greatest battle ever because this all took place in the mind of god before the foundation of the world then god decided to condense in from the invisible to the visible and the way he started to do that was he began to emanate himself from a point of light now it's a super natural light the prophet says and questions and answers on genesis that can only be seen with a super natural eye so don't be looking for god through your natural eyes this morning you want to look through a super natural the way you get that eye is you begin to hear the word because the hearing of the word brings about faith and god predicated his entire plan on one entity and that is faith and faith is something for which you believe in listen careful now this goes against everything that we're taught faith is predicated upon belief in something in which there is no proof [Music] can i read something to you i know i got it here you just bear with me in the message power of transformation listen careful 10 31 65 paragraph 136 136-7 brother branham speaking when i go home this time i want you all to know he never made it to jeffersonville but listen to how he says it when i go home this time i'm preaching on the subject the trail of the serpent the beast at the beginning and the beast at the end and trail him right through the bible and show how he heads up see and you all get that on the telephone you see if the lord permits us to do it and now just watch now how cunning watch how cunning that fellow is how he's just exactly just well they're just like judas and jesus there both brothers in their tribe just like esau and jacob and like the crow and the dove sitting on the same roost and everything is a twin man in in this great warfare that we're in it'd be so close the two spirits would be so close they will look like identical twins and if you're not familiar with identical twins listen close they have the same dna but there is something that separates them you say yeah well one might have a mole or one might have a widow's peak or one might i'm going to tell you that in the human genome project they've discovered what separates an identical twin they have the same exact genetic strengths listen careful but some of them are not lit up in one of the twins i know it sounds strange some of them are darkened they can see the string but watch now there's a gap here there's a gap here there's a gap here and there's a gap here in this long dna string and they are they are dark spots blemishes if you're following me all right listen now amen the enemy uses deception like he did to eve oh god has said oh now it's a quotation surely but surely see see trying to reason it beyond what god said originally and what did he originally say thou shall die see he said yes god said that watch the devil now watch how close it is but surely see that spray over it see but what god says god keeps i like this part he don't need any help from satan because satan's going to try to help it he keeps at sea so don't never be deceived by that now we notice then that it brought forth of its kind now in genesis here we find out after the spraying of this poison of knowledge now science is knowledge you want you want to see modern events made clear by prophecy this was preached in 1965 and what is the mantra coming forth right now because of what men have done to this world all we hear is science science science science that's right ain't it the truth come on oh follow the science believe the science did you know that the prophet of god said science is the devil's religion amen absolutely god of this evil age it's nothing but satan trying to figure out listen careful now how to be a creator but because he can't create everything he touches eventually becomes a perversion he misses it somewhere all right the great subject in school science today a better automobile a better this a better home a better house a better this a better that what are we doing dying all the time created an audible bill listen to what he says we quit walking [Laughter] listen i'm going to take it down to right now that cell phone you got you can't remember your own phone number let alone anybody else's but back in the day when the telephone first come out you had to remember all kinds of stuff area codes and phone numbers and who they belong to now people i say what's your phone number i don't know i got to look it up see how it's going it's weakening humanity now i'm not preaching against your gadgets i'm just learning how to use them myself but i want you to understand how the enemy operates because we're in a battle and listen god has called upon a group of people and we happen to live in the day when that group of people exist to slay the dragon that's our responsibility and by the end of this morning's message we'll find out how it is to be done amen i love the god's word amen it's the best dying all the time created an automobile we quit walking we quit walking we would turn to blubber that's right brother well we don't have man anymore i mean look at the time we live in i don't know we have jellyfish quote unquote that's right amen now i read that because the beast at the beginning is the beast at the end amen let's turn to genesis 3. i know you all know these things but i'd like to have a solid bible foundation for them and in genesis 3 it begins to speak about the beast at the beginning genesis 3 1. now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field how many knows what the word subtle means it's crafty sly which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman this serpent this beast could talk and he could talk in the language that eve the church understood amen and he said unto the woman yay that's right uh-huh let me quote it to you and god said ye shall not eat of every tree she he shall not eat of every tree of the garden question that's right huh see how he approaches he's not making a statement he's asking a question and the reason he's asking a question is because he wants to see where you're at yeah right amen and the church excuse me the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die and the serpent who's the beast at the beginning said unto the woman ye shall not surely die oh come on he's a good god he loves everybody yes he does i believe that with all my heart but the prophet of god defined the word love for us it's not mish-mash and mush it's not slobbering all over one another it's not buying toys and trinkets and diamonds and jewelry which we think is love you know the boy won't be quiet buy him a toy what did brother branham say spoiled billy paul to the max where did he find him in the backyard with a stick and a spoon and all kinds of toils why because the the attention span only lasts so long watch this devil now watch this serpent amen and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for god doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and he shall be his gods knowing good and evil brother branham said he was preaching the truth right there he was telling her what the results were going to be of not keeping god's word and look at the mess it has cost we may know good and evil but somehow we don't know the difference between good and evil and when the woman saw the word saul means to understand that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes i'm going to tell you right now can i tell you this it's why pornography is so popular it's pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise took the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat and what happened and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sowed fig leaves together and made themselves apron now here's the beast at the beginning and brother branham was on his way home from the west stopping along the way and preaching one message after the other like the rapture and so forth and he never made it home but he had every intention of going home and preaching what he called about a four-hour message trailing you know because he was a guide and a guy knows how to look for sign so he was going to take all of the signs that the serpent left from genesis and take us all the way through the scripture to the book of revelation where the beast rears its ugly head now do you know how it got there it got there through the fall of rome did you know that now a lot of people are always squalling especially in this message about the catholic church about the catholics and about the pope well i can tell you right now that we love every catholic person there isn't one catholic person we don't love right now they're trapped that's right they don't know it but they're in bondage because they have decided to step out on the trail that this serpent left that's right now there would not be a catholic church by the way there's no way that peter could have been the first pope no that's right amen and some people say well that's because he wasn't in rome that ain't got nothing to do with it catholic church didn't come into existence till about 3 50 a.d peter had been dead for about 300 years so there's no way he could be the pope of the first catholic church it got its beginning through politics look where we're at brothers and sisters i don't stand behind the pulpit and preach on politics but i want everybody to know there's two horns on that one head and one of them is ecclesiastical which is religious which is church which is is is the bible in a perverted form which is even the message in a perverted form now you can't pervert this bible and you can't pervert this message but you have to have some place to begin and that's where satan the beast put his dirty hands on god's heritage we were to come forth from this word whether you realize it or not that's why jesus had to be born of a spoken word and although that word was spoken by god through the mouth of an angel and then record it in written history without the faith of one woman named mary without the faith of a church that existed at the time of the fulfillment of that word nothing would have happened it was 800 or 740 years from the time isaiah said behold a virgin shall conceive until a person came along mary a type of the church came along and decided it was time i can do this why can't i be one just like all the other women have thought they were the one are you beginning to get it oh we're in a battle and that battle is going on right now in this building in your spirit and it is battling your soul for possession that's right amen did you realize that you say no brother i'm one with god if you were you'd be like enoch and you wouldn't be here that's right i got enough sense to know that it's going to require the mystical body coming to perfection one at a time one at a time but when a person comes to perfection in the mystical body of christ they are the most humble most peaceable most loving most kind but not a jellyfish now oh no that's they they didn't get to where they're at by being a jellyfish they got there by being a soldier in the army of the lord amen he's still with me this morning let me read one more thing to you if i could i like to give confirmation in the message power of transformation prescott arizona 1031 of 65 when i go home this time i'm preaching on the subject the trail of the serpent the beast at the beginning beast at the end trying to do god of service without it being his will 11 27 65. now when i speak paragraph 86 of denominations i'm not meaning for you to be so cruel and no i don't mean for you not to go to your church go to your church what you're supposed to do but just don't join up with them organizations because one day i'll be telling you and prove it by the scripture it's the mark of the beast and just remember it's the mark i'm preaching i wouldn't preach it in brother jack's church he'd tell me go ahead and do it but i'm going to the tabernacle it'll be about four hours long and my subject is the beast at the beginning and the beast at the end through the trail of a serpent did you notice that through the trail of a serpent over here it was the trail of the serpent all right see takes about four hours i got my scriptures all laying out that'd be i would have loved to have had them notes wouldn't you brother sammy the beast from the beginning he was the beast at the garden of eden he's the beast at the end and show that he's a religious person and a denomination that made the denomination and come right through the trail of it and prove it to you by the scriptures that it is i didn't know that till the holy spirit give it to me the other day up there i wonder how high up he was ah yeah heavenly places in christ jesus no doubt now brothers and sisters let's turn back to revelations if we could you just go with me to revelations chapter 12. we're going to read a little bit more out of there if that's all right all right i i keep forgetting you got it up on the board ain't nobody turning their bible well i hope you can find it in the bible but there will come a day brother samuel and i were talking when the bible has to be inscribed on the tables of your heart because i can tell you right now they're coming to take this away you may not realize especially the young people that have been schooled in a certain way and and the school system is has tried to bring generations of children here in the last 50 60 years around to and they don't know it around to a way of thinking that will eventually try to turn them against god and his word but of course the elect the bible tells us will not be deceived amen you still with me amen verse 11 where we left off in revelations 12 and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil has come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time you see the devil's a lot sharper than we give him credit for he has knowledge that it's just a short time and when the dragon saw that he was cast under the earth oh did he get mad he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man-child and to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle praise the lord for a prophet amen that she might fly into the wilderness into her place where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent and the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood brothers and sisters what is water in this scripture peoples nations multitudes tongues look what's coming after us and the serpent cast out his mouth water as a flood after the woman these are people that he's sending out to chase down you and i and try to convince us that we're wrong amen right that's right but what does god do whenever there's a flood he raises a standard amen all right and that standard is his word amen that he might cause her to be carried away in the flood now come on let's look at this if enough people come at you enough of your friends and your family enough of your co-workers and the people that you're around on array and and the educational system they they send it out like a flood look and look at the media and how it's all the way it works and it's trying to convince you and bring an element of doubt into your mind that maybe just maybe we could be going about this the wrong way it's it's a tactic to try to convince you that maybe possibly and bring an element of doubt just one element is all it takes and look what the covet 19 has accomplished again not taking away from the precious people that we loved and we knew that got very sick and or passed from it but let me tell you brothers and sisters something if they were a believer they're in a much better place than we are i'll tell you that right now but but also as the sister was telling me perhaps it could be that god in his foreknowledge and i don't say it could be i say it is a fact if they passed before we which are alive and remain then they were meant to come up in the resurrection and let me quote it again to you they without us cannot be made perfect amen can you imagine i want you to imagine this brother branham went beyond the curtain of time is that right and he saw thousands or tens of thousands and maybe millions of converts and it looked pretty good they didn't have to get tired they didn't have to go to work didn't have to punch a clock they were all happy they were just living life seemingly to what we would consider its fullest but they were still lacking something through all that even brother branham said i don't want to go back right you've got to go back eventually god honored his wish and took him back over to that place amen where those people were at listen careful do you believe the prophet's there i'm asking you do you believe the prophet's there of course we do listen now they yes come on brother without us including him amen where's paul's group there there including him cannot be made perfect without us chris god has equipped us yes god is instilled in us something that will be able to take this battle all away to the end we will be the representatives of the dragon slayer did you realize that that old devil the serpent we call lucifer and satan is a star he's a hollywood star he's a music star he's a rap star listen now let's read about it isaiah 14 if you've got your bibles see i could preach for oh six seven hours on this one but i'm not gonna isaiah 14 if you would you know what brothers back there in the computer room would you do me a favor and implement an app that would make that sound like pages were turning okay i got it there you go yeah record that i'm just not used to it that's all right you love the lord amen all right how about if we read from verse nine you with me now if you've got a scofield bible what does it say in the margin above uh between eight and nine the beast in hell ouch hell from beneath his move for thee to meet thee at thy coming it stireth up the dead for thee even all the chief ones of the earth oh i always wondered where elvis and john wayne were yeah that's right you can put your people in there your generation of people that's right even all the chief ones of the earth it hath raised up from their thrones they were important here and all the kings of the nations oh they shall speak and say unto thee are you the guy yeah art thou also become weak as we art thou become like unto us thy pomp is brought down to the grave and the noise of thy viles the worm is spread under thee and the worms cover thee how art thou fallen from heaven oh lucifer son of the morning we read about it how it happened in revelations 12 michael and his angels fought see son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which that's weak in the nations for thou hast said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god that's why it's very difficult for young people today they look at all these icons and they go i don't know man our church is kind of dead these folks over here they got it going on you know all these all these different uh entities uh from hollywood and the music world and so forth and youtube now and and facebook and twitter and and instagram and all that the kardashians and so forth well i'm going to tell you that the kardashians unless they get converted are up there in verse 9 and 10. right no offense to them because they are souls also amen but listen i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation the sides of the north i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like he's selling himself short did you get it even his own words i will be like the most high when the bride of christ realizes that she came from god she'll go back to god she won't just be like the most high she will be part of the most high don't sell yourself short and i know the attitude of people oh boy that's how lucifer got his start no it's not no amen because those people who are willing to accept that they were in the mind of god before the foundation of the world as his attributes did not have a start you can see satan had a beginning oh how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer the son of the morning he had a beginning and because he had a beginning he could only see the stars of heaven he wanted to put himself above the heavens but did you realize that there is something called the death of a star i talked to an astronomer friend of mine that i'm acquainted with that's going through college to be an astronomer and he began to talk to me about the death of a star you young people and some of you old people who know what it's called a supernova it's if it's just a regular star guess what it it's just a chevy nova yeah but if it's a great star if it's a powerful star it's called a supernova and what happens is it gets so great and so powerful that its own gravitational pull begins to collapse on itself that's how the devil got a third of the stars of heaven to believe his tale it says t-a-i-l in revelations 12 but brother adam said it's a t-a-l-e they began to believe his story and their faith began to erode so much so that in the book of jude jude said that they were angels that kept not their first estate so listen they had a god-given estate yes but it wasn't good enough it wasn't big enough it wasn't pretty enough it wasn't valuable enough can you imagine and then one of god's heritage saying i'd rather be the gatekeeper at the house of god then to sit in the seat of the ungodly and the scornful and then the prophet of god even brought it down lower than king david he said i would rather be the doormat brothers and sisters if you're just the doormat right listen careful you have one of the greatest responsibilities in all of the kingdom and you'd say well it doesn't sound very glorifying until you read about the foot wash flunky then you find out that he himself made himself the doormat i love that because he washed their feet he's so good to us let us continue i hate to get off i want to make sure i get this part in here this star is so powerful that it begins to collapse on itself so the story that it told to get it there that gravitated so-called believers towards it like a flood began to collapse into a real small dense property so small and so dense they tell us that a supernova explodes and brings into existence it don't create nothing but it what it does is the explosion of that supernova opens a gate oh glory and that gate is called a black hole right now i asked this astronomer because the lord was dealing with me all the time because i i was seven steps ahead of this fella as he's talking to me but since he didn't understand what we understand i just kept questioning so tell me what's on the other side of a black hole he said we don't know we can only guess he said but what we can see with the most powerful telescopes is when this supernova collapses explodes and then we see what looks like a black hole because there's no light emanating from the other side of it coming through the hole and this the debris from this collapsed star you see all of the believers that followed that old devil that's right oh yeah are beginning to swirl around like a whirlpool like a tornado or like when you flush your toilet yeah that's right it's going into a bottomless pit and as soon as he told me that i said oh amen outer darkness that's exactly what that speaks to me that's that's outer darkness and let me tell you how close we are to that brother branham said when he quoted the scripture weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth and outer darkness he was not referring to the cannon fodder he was referring to the foolish virgin amen that's what he said so see how close it is brothers and sisters please don't settle for foolish virgins because if you think you're gonna settle for foolish virgin you're probably not one because the prophet of god said that the foolish virgin believes to the hundred percent of what she can believe that she is the bride of christ the only difference between her and the bride of christ is she don't have oil which is the holy ghost which means she wasn't originally in the mind of god before the foundation of the world but you were that ought to make you shout do you believe that you were in the mind of god before the foundational world you don't have a beginning right all right that's right you say well you don't know brother i got lots of problems it's a battle that's right brother god allowed his attributes to bypass their theophanies which by the way are the stars of heaven so that we could listen now suffer no be victorious see it all depends on your attitude and your attitude determines your altitude if you think you're suffering you're going to suffer but if you say this is a trial this is my tribulation this is going to perfect me this is going to give me patience i'm going to be the stature of a perfect man in the fullness of christ then while you're being beat upon you're smiling and guess what else you're doing praise the lord i'm being tried like gold in the fire and as soon as he's got all the draw speed out of me he'll be able to see his reflection in me i love that i love that speaks volumes to me all right let me keep moving so this black hole i'm calling it outer darkness i'm not making a doctrine out of it i just want you to know how the lord deals with me i can see it and then i said so is that all they know is that all they call it he says no he says some call it a wormhole serious he said yeah i said well what do they mean by that well they think that it's a passageway a shortcut in god's word there are no shortcuts but i'm going to preach this to you that black hole is a shortcut yeah sure but but not to eternal life not to eternal life that's right he's still with me the other thing he told me which i thought was fascinating and i couldn't explain it all to you some of you young folks that study astronomy probably could he said as this supernova is collapsing every once in a while one of them just turns into a small dense mass about 12 kilometers in diameter which is tiny compared to a planet or a star it's just a giant basketball yeah right right like a meteor and he said something begins to happen to it and it goes through a transformation and it runs through this transformation really rapidly and it starts at the top listen careful at the element table and it begins to go through the element table transforming itself from from this and from that and from this and from that and from golden from silver and that another all the way down until it gets to iron and i found this fascinating brother samuel when this man was telling me this he said when it gets to the part of the element table it's passed through and transformed itself into all these different elements till it gets to iron once it gets to iron it can't figure out how to go any further come on brother how many knows what iron represents it can't get any further than that and when he was talking to me about it transforming itself from one element to the other and stopping at iron this is what came to me oh he's trying to be a creator you see if he could have gotten himself all the way to the bottom of the element table and even into those those uh those little elements they're trying to dig up that the computer industries what are they called they're uh the ones that are like on a meteor and they're in the moon and they're they're looking hard for them because they need them okay he can't go there no brothers and sisters he can't touch us you see because our father yes amen is the creator and he's he didn't just run the element table he made it amen he made it so you can see how how lucifer is is his mindset is to try to be like god how about it how about ezekiel 28 we got enough time to read that let's go there right we can keep reading but i'd like to read ezekiel 28 if you'd go with me there i believe that's where it's found in the school field it says the rebuke of of the king of tyre but we'll we'll go down to verse 12 verse 11 moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of tyrus and say unto him thus saith the lord sir hey did you realize that the prophet of god told us in spoken word is the original seed that the bride will have thus saith the lord and the bride because she is one with him will also represent the son of man as one like unto listen careful son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of tirus and say unto him thus saith the lord god thou sealest up the psalm full of wisdom and perfect in beauty see she recognizes him thou hast been in eden the garden of god how do we know that amen because he got one of ours every precious stone was thy covering the sardius topaz diamond that's why i wanted to see sister june what you guys all got there at the gym place see then the diamond the burl the onyx the jasper sapphire the emerald and the carbuncle and gold the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou west here's the beginning now this is not us this is him amen thou art the anointed cherub that covereth watch what you're looking for yes sir and i have set these soul thou waste upon the holy mountain of god thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire that was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created until amen iniquity was found in me now i could keep reading but i want to instill something in you in order for you or this entity to be a worker of iniquity you had to at one time know the truth because you cannot be a doer of iniquity without knowing what not or what to do right right you're with me yes sir because iniquity is to know and not do it or not do it and know you should brothers and sisters see how it's constantly just weeding out if we would say that it's it's thinning out less and less and less unless you eat this the the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood he said you have no life in you he didn't explain it prophet said he just come out and said it why to thin the crowd and then the crowd that he had left after he thinned them down of course one of them was judas iscariot that's right because it had to be so close but the other 11 said what's this guy talking about right cannibalism of the son of man yet so they did not understand what he was saying but guess what luke 17 30 says in the day that the son of man is revealed brothers and sisters you and i have what it takes to be able to discern the difference and not be workers of iniquity amen but be doers of the manifestations of the sons and daughters of god i believe that and that and i'm going to tell you as i as i wind down here that's what's going to kill him that's what's going to destroy the dragon it's not it's not a battle like you and i think it's a great battle it wasn't that way do you know that the battle that started in heaven with michael and his angels and lucifer and his angels was a church service did you know that did you know that my that's right brother michael got up there and spoke and michael had some congregational members that understood everything he said or had a revelation of what he was saying and why he was saying it and they said amen all right now i want to ask you a personal question if if i was the devil if i was lucifer and you knew it let's say i have my name tag lucifer what's yours right and i was gonna get and you knew what you know about him and i was gonna get up behind the pulpit would you say amen eve did he did mistake you never say amen to a portion of the word of god right you say amen to every single word and that's where the dragon is being slain as long as he's got a congregation of people and of course in revelations 12 it says one third yeah that's right but that's not what the prophet said in every case that's right i'm going to read that one because it would be a needful for me to hurry i told the sister that i was going to preach on angels so let me read this first do i have a little bit of time brother samuel questions and answers law having a shadow 5 16 of 54. paragraph 68 the dragon who was the dragon he says congregation says satan satan that's right and what nation did it represent congregation says rome and he had angels didn't the bible say that in the last days that the ministering spirits of the devil would be like flaming angels but if they speak not according to this let them alone the devil will transform his messengers into angels of light and organize right back just exactly like rome did that's the reason why he can't go any further than iron on the element table okay because that's all he's been given by the lord he can only go this far brother sister i don't see where you could find a loophole in that but they look for them they're wormholes and i'm going to tell you that wormhole is just a fancy pants name for outer darkness god has just got it all walled up there right here in his word there it is and he's he said he did now watch and michael the archangel the great one that stands in the presence of god and his angels fought against satan and his angels the red dragon listen now look at the next one and that was the church [Music] that's led by the holy spirit and the angels of god fought against the organization and its angels and ministers of light what you mean there was an organization in heaven that's where it all started that's where denomination started do you know what the word denomination really means if you go back to its roots it means the value of a name that's why for us older folks excuse me young people you may not know this but the one dollar bill was called a one dollar denominational note the five dollar bill was called a five dollar denominational note now the two most famous presidents of this country are on the one and the five why you'd think they'd be worth on the ten thousand dollar bill and the hundred thousand dollar bill as great amen as they were but what people don't realize is the thinking of the founding fathers which we're not supposed to use that name happy father's day that's right happy father's day to them too was the fact that they realized that the common man would handle a lot more one dollar and five dollar bills and they'd never see a hundred dollar bill so the more popular the president what looks like the lower denomination gives his name more value he came not to be served but he came to serve he came to humble himself you see denomination means the value of a name the most valuable name the name above every name amen is the lord jesus christ but the reason why the love of money is the root of how much evil a-l-l all evil the law not money but the love of money is the root of all evil because satan wants you to value himself and you higher yes yes that's right than god himself right because he set out to exalt himself above all that is called god in thessalonians or sits in the house of god brothers and sisters do you realize that god has given you the greatest value that he could bestow upon anybody and it was by faith that he did it it takes 100 lots to make an abraham right yep that's right god values the silver dollar higher than any denominational note there is what does silver mean redemption because brother banham tells us that the plan of redemption was only written for one class one group absolutely one entity and that's the elect everybody else that gets salvation out of this deal is collateral benefits that's that's what i call it collateral benefits everybody else's collateral damage i'm sorry if this sounds hurtful but brother branham called him cannon fodder you know what cannon fodder is have any of you young people ever had one of them little things on the fourth of july you pull the string and pop all this stuff comes out of it that's fire yeah yeah just floats to the ground and gets walked on and disintegrates yeah that's right but not the bride of christ she is the true dragon slayer and i'll just cut to the chase for time this is how she does it revelations if you would chapter 20. god is good all the time he put a song of praise in this heart of mine god is good you got it do i hear them pages turning well i'm just used to it revelation 20 verse 1 and i saw an angel come down from heaven now remember something brothers and sisters the book of revelation is the book of symbols amen i've already preached this here it's our book amen it's a specific book meant for a specific group of people they are prophetic class they understand the types and the shadows that every scripture listen now the prophet said and every prophecy is compound amen okay and i saw an angel and here we are thinking that we're watching television no i understood that an angel come down from heaven is that right like revelations 10 amen all right having the key of the bottomless pit yes i love it now we're thinking of a key but the prophet of god said god does not have skeleton keys his key is the word every time having the key of the bottomless pit what's a bottomless pit without foundation that is the reason why people find themselves in the condition they find themselves in many years down the road is because they did not receive the right foundation now now now to your consolation if you found yourself with the right with the wrong foundation brother branham said tear it down that's right amen he's given you the opportunity to start over oh it'll take me years oh no it's the twinkling of an eye you can be to the stature of listen the prophet of god taught you could be bap repent be baptized in water receive the holy ghost coming up out of the water and be sealed but most of us have a battle to fight right a journey that we have to go on a walk that we have to walk and a talk that we have to talk why because god wants to experience and he is through you and i every nuance yes every strange even even listen now every unbelieving thought now god doesn't take those thoughts into him but he understands what it means to be tempted because the bible says he was tempted on every single point right whoa that's temptation amen but what did he say not my will but thine be done i do nothing he said unless the father shows me first now brothers and sisters he didn't bypass his theophany we did but the father is showing us that's right that's right are you willing to take it that's the key amen this bottomless pit has no foundation when brother branham was shot by one of his childhood friends with the shotgun in the legs and lost all that blood and went to the hospital do you realize that william mariam branham was falling into this bottomless pit the same one that everyone falls into if they don't have the seal of god amen right yes sir but because god's right he was lost he was undone but because it wasn't his time and god was going to use him god put something in his heart there was no mother there there was no father listen listen this outer darkness this black hole the reason it's a black hole is because brother brown said there's no god there no oh he could go there if he wanted to but he doesn't want to so he's not there no right that's right yeah because he said that there was no god there i cried bob dad grandpa pastor oh god yep he had no foundation yet and started the work to build the stature of a perfect man in the fullness of christ and brother branham says that we can build on and on and on and we'll get up towards the top of that that that that stature and we'll be tempted and we'll be our temperance or our patience or something will be tried that's way down below and we'll fail brother brown said you never got that sealed go back to that point and get that sealed it doesn't take away from what you already have but it does allow for that weak spot to be made strong still with me yes sir all right let me move along you can tell i like this subject key to the bottomless pit and a great chain in this hand i know a lot of preachers have preached on this i'm okay with that cause i'm gonna preach on it and he laid hold on the dragon come here boy i got you now okay that old serpent which is the devil and satan see see the beast at the beginning and the beast at the end and bound him a thousand years and cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him now it's not us getting a seal it's us giving it amen i'll tell you how i know it's us let me cut to the quit questions and answers 8 23 of 64 in the morning paragraph 222 now there you are to the question a while ago see at the judgment seat here we go brother samuel jesus the church amen come on did you realize he just said jesus the church don't that make you feel good makes me feel good amen because jesus and the church are one anyhow i believe this yeah man that's why it excites me so much so i believe this is me this is you this is us now you have a choice in this god voted for you satan voted against you now you vote and this isn't going to be a corrupt dominion voting machine notice the name of it dominion yeah this is entirely up to you nobody can interfere but you choose this day whom you will serve right it's a battle jesus the church the bride was raptured went up into glory and was up there and was married returned back to the earth and lived a thousand years and at the end of the thousand years satan was loosed out of his prison but what i got down here was what bound him what put him in that prison how did he get there he's out loose out of his prison that is bound by an angel with a chain not a log chain he's meaning not a natural big sick link chain but a chain of circumstance all of his subjects was in hell yeah right absolutely listen now that's why i read isaiah and ezekiel to you all that was resurrected on the earth was redeemed and jesus with them listen now this is what binds him this is what gets him thrown into the bottomless pit and this is how you and i come into this this is how we slay the dragon how do we slam because he doesn't have anything it's up there somewhere to work with the quote not that scripture i thought they'd have it up there they're faster than i am bound by an angel with a chain not a long chain but a chain of circumstance all of his subjects was in hell all that was resurrected on the earth was redeemed and jesus with them he couldn't work on nothing you see how we're binding him we're giving him nothing to work with the lord cannon fodder turns to nothing the only thing that's right brother ronnie the only thing he has to work with is you and me as god's heritage that's why he approached adam and eve how come he didn't go approach his own kind because he could see i'm going to tell you guys something that really really fascinates me the serpent was an innocent beast but what i'm saying is the serpent how could he be guilty he was an innocent beast but because he cast the wrong vote he was turned into that's right the rhythm snake let me get that part the names dragon means serpent and there's a constellation not just the twins that's right not just the virgin not just the cancer the crab not just leo the lion but there is a constellation of twins and we all know that brother branham taught us that the 12 stations of the zodiac was the first bible the reason why we don't use that bible anymore is because when the earth was knocked off its axis in the days of noah it could not be correctly read but it was readable at one time it spoke of the same things that you and i are receiving this morning but god decided to move yes forward he allowed a pyramid to be built that's right did y'all know that brother branham said that enoch carried the blueprints that's why he called the enoch's pyramid not the pyramid of chiops and not the great pyramid and not the pyramid of king tut but it was a bible now we're not into pyramid teachings he said it's also a memorial that you cannot destroy god or his word or what it stands for but here we are today with a paper bible but they're going by the wayside because i can't hear them pages turning brother samuel sorry so it's okay i want i'm making a point so it's got to become written in your heart not on a computer chip yes not on a video recording audio recording it's got to be engraved on the tables of your heart because brothers and sisters at the end of this battle they're coming after us yes sir like a flood can't you see it amen but god will raise a standard and that standard will be his word and that word is the bride because she and the word have become one according to the words of the prophet amen there's a constellation in all of those listen now there's a 13th constellation but it's not in the original yeah what's what's the number of this nation 13. what are we we are and the anti-type of israel that's right okay that's right and it's called draco the dragon serpent means to creep you want to get all the creepy things out of your life no wonder why they call him creepy joe yeah that's right yeah i mean i'm just repeating what they said amen they say a lot of things the devil in hebrew means satan like satan in the greek it's diablos what is the devil you want to get rid of him i'll tell you how to get rid of him don't give him anything to work with because he's an accuser stop accusing he's the backbiter stop backbone i got this from the dictionary he's a slanderer stop slandering okay he he's he's set at variance quit being coming independent and going off by yourself all the time this is the mystical body of christ you're either in the body or out of the body if you're in the body you're in fellowship with the rest of the body you're not some independent watch now star all by itself because if you find yourself in that condition satan can deal with you get in as quickly as you can how do i get in the bible says you're baptized into the body by the holy ghost you're with me the devil means accuser backbiter slanderer set at variance it means he's an attacker listen now the the dictionary said this as in a person's character today brother brandon said you don't have to literally kill somebody all you have to do is work that mouth and begin to destroy their character influence that's right take them down a little bit take them down hey did you know brother so-and-so that's why that's why it's very difficult for people like brother samuel and i to mention people's names truthfully because we realize what they are and who they are but we don't want to be responsible for defining the word devil but i do know that the lord taught us something in the way that he handled the sadducees and the pharisees because everybody's saying oh let's all get together if you want to get in together around the word amen but just getting together brother branham said god never forgave israel for the action of just getting together you're with me satan means adversary always viewed as an angel the dictionary said a messenger lucifer the morning star he's light and bearing light watch this chain of circumstance as i as i finish let me give you one more questions and answers 8 30 of 64 in the morning paragraph 149 no a generation a lot and then the bible is 40 years but the bible said and they lived and reigned with christ one thousand years it will be 1 000 years upon the earth because 1 000 years upon the earth has only counted a time for parable like to god as one day one thousand years upon the earth is only one day with god as god counting time how many understands that now that's found in the book of peter if you didn't know that so it's that sabbath day when the church will no more labor against sin and satan is bound for a little season a thousand years because his subjects is all in hell the church that's on earth is redeemed and right in the presence of christ so he has nothing he can work on that's right so it's not a chain as i said a log chain it's a chain of circumstance he has nothing he can do he's helpless and hopeless the bible says just waiting for the resurrection of the subjects that would be the second judgment right the second resurrection the white throne judgment and let me finish with this spoken word is the original seed part 2 paragraph three twenty six and eight god is taking the elect out of that pentecostal church that hybrid pulling it out finishing up the word finishing up the word that's you and me this has already been completed and it's got to be so close until the word itself will blend with this word that's you and me and it's got to be so close until the word itself will blend with this word there comes the headstone crying grace grace amazing grace did you not speak on grace this morning the headstone here you are like this see on there he's part probably pointing to the statue of a perfect man see how it weighs way wide down here at the bottom it keeps getting closer closer closer to ministry he says after a while here here come luther justification justified fighter come wesley sanctified bunch here come pentecostal restoration of the gifts now god is taking from there amen yeah right right buddy holding out a bunch if you young people don't know what a horn is it's like a piece of sandpaper it's like the stone you sharpen the edge of your knife with it's just rough enough to smooth out all the edges and put a sharp edge on both sides and a point begins to form you get the point here come pentecostal restoration of the gifts now god is taking from there holding out a bunch to make a ministry brothers and sisters don't let anybody take this away from you when somebody tries to tell you the fivefold ministry was all in william mary and branham you know what i could say well wait a minute brother wade i could say amen but he's not here that's right amen all right that's right yes now the five-fold ministry is in the mystical body of christ and you'd say well brother oh i don't have one of those titles you don't need one you just need to be in the body amen and take advantage of what god has instilled in that body for you amen and for me amen to make a ministry just exactly like the word there because it's got to fit with the word there's the bride take her up now christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil amen you believe that amen now i can't explain all this i'm just going to go through it just quickly now hit the high place so you won't stay too long oh praise the lord let's not stay too long quit prolonging this let's get to these high places christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil is that right congregation says you all believe that that's why what was he god's word which destroys the works of the hybrid the devil is that right he was done to do that he was born to be that to destroy the works of the devil now listen careful this last paragraph is the most important one now his body is to do the same thing amen amen we are the chain of circumstances and we've all heard it a chain is only as strong as its weakest link but i think if i'm paraphrasing correctly didn't the prophet say the weakest christians come on on his knees is stronger glory than any devil amen than any satan than any lucifer yes true brother than any dragon yes we're binding the dragon right now man right whether you realize it or not by believing every word amen and by taking our life and pouring it into that belief and becoming the manifestation for everything is groaning yes sir everything is waiting this world is upside down backwards and inside out guess what mother earth is asking for you and me please stand we are the chain of circumstances we will destroy the dragon we will win the war of words we will we will represent the death bringing that star to its death but remember the results of that is a black hole outer darkness we can't help that that's just the result of what god is permitting us to do brothers and sisters but today is the day of salvation let's pray father lord i i've asked for your help here lord and i believe you've rendered it father to try to bring that reader's digest version of a word that had no beginning and have no end is nearly impossible lord it's like a great minister that i knew at one time father many many years ago would say preaching the word of god is like going up a one-lane mountain road there's no place to turn around there's no way to back down father you've got to go all the way to the top if you can oh father we're asking lord that these words that were spoken as broken as they were father would be like the bread at the communion table lord and and just a sip of wine here and there father let it be instilled in the in the hearts of your children lord that they are a part and parcel father of these things that's our main goal

gonna sing one for you i saw the light amen did you see the light amen but it wasn't the light that he speaks of in second corinthians the transformation of satan and his angels but it's that point of

somebody must know i saw the light okay yeah now for g start with the course i saw the light i saw the light no more and darkness no more night now i'm so happy no sorrow inside well praise the lord i
