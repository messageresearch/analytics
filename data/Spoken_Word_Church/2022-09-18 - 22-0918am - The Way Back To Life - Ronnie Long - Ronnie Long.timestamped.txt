[45:29] believe that's talking about you
[45:32] it's a little different when it's
[45:33] talking about you amen
[45:35] you're singing about somebody else or
[45:36] somebody else's victory but when you're
[45:38] singing about your place in the book
[45:40] then it means something amen and i hear
[45:42] the voice of many angels sing worthy is
[45:44] the lamb amen
[45:46] i believe we have a place in the
[45:48] scripture
[45:49] where singing worthy is the lamb amen
[45:51] you can stand with us and open your
[45:52] bibles to john the 14th chapter it's

[46:15] some people we go travel around and
[46:17] we'll stay with some folks and it's just
[46:19] stressful the whole time because you're
[46:20] worried about the kids upsetting
[46:21] something or knocking something over but
[46:23] i like to stay with folks that are used
[46:25] to having kids so we thank you rachel
[46:27] for the opportunity
[46:29] amen
[46:30] i'd like to speak for a few moments this
[46:32] morning on the way back to life
[46:35] the 6th verse of the 14th chapter jesus
[46:37] saith unto him i am the way the truth
[46:40] and the life no man cometh unto the
[46:42] father but by me if you had known me you
[46:45] should have known my father also and
[46:47] from henceforth you know him and have
[46:50] seen him
[46:51] we drop down to the 26th verse but the
[46:53] comforter which is the holy ghost whom
[46:56] the father will send in my name
[46:58] he shall teach you all things
[47:01] some things
[47:03] all things and bring you all things to
[47:05] your remembrance whatsoever i have said
[47:08] unto you peace i leave with you my peace
[47:11] i give unto you not as the world giveth
[47:13] i give unto you
[47:15] let not your heart be troubled neither
[47:17] let it be afraid amen father we ask that
[47:20] you would just be with us this morning
[47:22] and
[47:23] lord we've laid ourselves aside lord
[47:25] we've
[47:26] we we've surrendered ourselves to you
[47:27] afresh at your altar this morning father
[47:30] asking that you would just have your
[47:31] will and your way father may you find us
[47:34] under the blood this morning lord may we
[47:35] find a refuge in in your word this
[47:38] morning i pray that you just hide us
[47:39] under your the the shadow of your wing
[47:42] father and
[47:43] lord it's just words on a paper unless
[47:45] you're here to quicken it to our hearts
[47:47] father and lord we ask that your spirit
[47:49] would just have preeminence lord father
[47:52] we take every spirit in this building
[47:53] under our control lord that be subject
[47:55] to your word father lord that everything
[47:57] will be done in perfect order lord and
[47:59] that you would just be well pleased with
[48:01] what's said and done in here this
[48:02] morning lord i pray that our hearts will
[48:03] be open lord as a field ready to harvest
[48:06] father
[48:07] lord may we just hear from your throne
[48:09] this morning we ask in the name of jesus
[48:11] christ amen you may be seated amen amen
[48:15] i like that scripture there because he's
[48:17] promising us peace
[48:19] not that the world gives unto you he's
[48:21] not saying that he's going to give us
[48:22] world peace but he's giving us the peace
[48:25] of the holy ghost the peace that passes
[48:27] all understanding when we don't know
[48:29] where we're going or where we're coming
[48:30] from we have a promise of peace and i
[48:33] know i've had to lean on that promise in
[48:34] this scripture many times in my life to
[48:37] know when i don't know how tomorrow's
[48:38] going to come i know who's holding
[48:40] tomorrow i know that it's going to come
[48:42] in his hand and i know that his decision
[48:44] is perfect and he's never made a mistake
[48:46] about it and he's not ever retreated or
[48:49] regretted but his decisions are perfect
[48:51] the first time and i thank god that we
[48:53] have a peace with the holy ghost that he
[48:56] promised to send it in our time and in
[48:58] our age and you know we can get a long
[49:00] way with just an intellectual
[49:02] intellectual conception of what this
[49:04] word is and we can make it a long way
[49:06] down the road with just understanding
[49:08] the knowledge of the word but when he
[49:10] the spirit of truth comes and he comes
[49:12] into us and he leads us and he guides us
[49:15] in all things unto perfection that's
[49:17] when we're walking a real christian walk
[49:19] when it's not us trying to make the
[49:20] effort to do it but it's he the spirit
[49:23] of truth within us
[49:25] that's doing the work within us amen
[49:28] first john the fourth chapter if we
[49:30] could turn to that i'm sorry brothers in
[49:32] the back you just have to
[49:33] give me grace
[49:34] beloved believe not every spirit but try
[49:37] the spirits whether they are of god
[49:39] because many false prophets are gone out
[49:41] into the world hereby know ye the spirit
[49:43] of god
[49:44] every spirit that confesseth that jesus
[49:46] christ has come in the flesh of god and
[49:48] every spirit that confesses not that
[49:50] jesus christ has come in the flesh is
[49:52] not of god
[49:54] i believe that applies to today
[49:57] every spirit that testifies that jesus
[49:59] christ has come in the flesh
[50:01] in this hour is of god and every spirit
[50:04] that does not testify that he's come in
[50:06] the flesh it's not of god right i don't
[50:08] believe there's an expiration date on
[50:10] first john 4. did you see one there i
[50:12] didn't see an expiration date so i
[50:13] believe that's current and up to date
[50:15] amen
[50:17] and this is that spirit of antichrist
[50:20] wherever ye have heard that it should
[50:21] come and even now already is it in the
[50:24] world ye are of god little children and
[50:27] have overcome them
[50:28] because greater is he that is in you
[50:31] than he that is in the world
[50:34] they are of the world therefore speak
[50:36] thee of the world they of the world and
[50:38] the world heareth them but we some we
[50:41] say we
[50:42] we are of god he that knoweth god
[50:45] heareth us he that is not of god heareth
[50:48] not us hereby know we the spirit of
[50:51] truth and the spirit of error
[50:54] so we have two spirits working within
[50:56] the framework of the church right we
[50:58] have two spirits that are that are
[50:59] actively working within the church but
[51:01] we've just been given a promise in first
[51:03] john to say that we recognize the true
[51:06] spirit we will recognize the spirit of
[51:08] error and we will recognize the true
[51:10] spirit and one we will reject and one we
[51:13] will accept so the choice is up to us of
[51:15] which spirit we're going to accept in
[51:17] this age
[51:18] i believe it's clearly defined on which
[51:20] spirit is the spirit of truth it's the
[51:22] one that leads you and guides you into
[51:25] all things
[51:26] it's he that has come we're not waiting
[51:28] for him to come it's he that has come
[51:31] he is leading us and he is guiding us
[51:33] i'm so thankful that we have a sure word
[51:36] in this hour
[51:37] i'm not wondering where i'm going or
[51:39] what i believe in or how i'm going to
[51:41] get there but i've already been given a
[51:43] word of prophecy that tells me my
[51:46] destination i've just got to put my name
[51:48] attached to that right you've got to see
[51:50] yourself in every scripture i see myself
[51:52] here in this scripture is recognizing
[51:55] the spirit of truth in my day
[51:57] i'm not looking for another answer
[52:00] i'm not looking for another option i
[52:02] already have a secure word i'm not
[52:04] looking to to to move on or sell out if
[52:06] i was going to sell out i would have
[52:08] sold out years ago
[52:10] keep my hand up
[52:12] i thought you were getting excited and
[52:13] saying amen but he was just telling me
[52:14] to keep my hand up
[52:19] many people will sell their souls for a
[52:21] price
[52:22] some will sell it for a million million
[52:25] dollar american idol contract or some
[52:27] will sell it for uh uh you know being a
[52:31] maybe a basketball star a football star
[52:33] or maybe they'll sell it for much less
[52:35] maybe they'll be some basement warrior
[52:37] playing some video game in their in
[52:38] their room all day and that's what
[52:40] they've sold their soul to but i believe
[52:44] i believe in this age we have a sure
[52:46] word of prophecy of what what our soul
[52:48] is valued at i'm not going to sell
[52:50] myself short to say that i i'm just
[52:52] almost going to make it to the line and
[52:54] then i'm going to fall short but we are
[52:55] given a sure word of prophecy that we
[52:58] will cross the line there is a
[53:00] generation of finishers in this hour
[53:02] that will finish the work that was
[53:04] started 2 000 years ago we will finish
[53:07] the word that was started when paul
[53:09] preached it the word that was started
[53:11] when peter preached it the word that was
[53:13] prophesied when jesus spoke it there
[53:15] will be somebody that will finish that
[53:17] work i believe we make up that group of
[53:19] people in this hour we're not selling
[53:21] short for some distraction of this world
[53:23] but we've been given a prophecy that we
[53:26] follow that because it means it's our
[53:28] life it's our source it's our it's our
[53:30] blood we're not selling ourselves for a
[53:32] million dollars
[53:33] or some religious spirit but we know
[53:36] where we're going
[53:38] many people have the bible and they sell
[53:39] themselves to some church or some
[53:41] foundation or something that will give
[53:43] them an offering or a better check
[53:46] somewhere and they'll sell themselves to
[53:47] that but i have i have sold out to this
[53:50] message i'm not looking for anything
[53:52] else i've sold everything that i am for
[53:54] this i'm not looking for another reason
[53:56] or a question of how to get out of it
[53:58] i've sold everything that i am to it
[54:01] i would ask every individual what have
[54:03] you sold yourself to
[54:05] you you know i've been attacked for
[54:06] selling myself out to the prophecy of
[54:08] what they call a man but i said you sold
[54:11] yourself to much less
[54:14] you sold yourself to uh to a work
[54:16] contract that works not even going to
[54:18] make a difference that job will fire you
[54:20] next year when times get tough that bank
[54:22] account you've been building will get
[54:23] empty as soon as the irs comes for it
[54:26] that house that you paid off it's not
[54:28] really yours
[54:29] that property that you work for it's not
[54:31] really yours
[54:33] but we we need to be sure what we've
[54:35] anchored our soul into
[54:37] every hour that we spend on this earth
[54:39] is going to be accounted to something
[54:41] we've got to know what it's accounted to
[54:44] i would rather be i'd rather be guilty
[54:46] of spending of spending all my time
[54:48] around this word than spending way too
[54:50] much time building a kingdom for
[54:52] somebody else for some some pharaoh out
[54:54] there somewhere or some egyptian
[54:56] somewhere out there that doesn't care
[54:58] about you and you might be building your
[55:00] own company but guess what that company
[55:02] be taken away tomorrow just like that
[55:05] i know i have my own business i know how
[55:07] close it is when the irs decides that
[55:08] it's you it's theirs it's theirs
[55:11] you can run everything right you could
[55:13] cross all your eyes and cross your well
[55:15] you dodge your eyes and cross your t's
[55:18] yeah right right but the point i'm
[55:20] making is that our we must be secure in
[55:23] where we are invested in
[55:26] you know for for
[55:27] for ages the church has been looking for
[55:30] for a fruit to come
[55:33] for the for the first stage they were
[55:34] looking for a fruit to manifest in the
[55:36] second age they were looking for a fruit
[55:38] to manifest and
[55:39] and and and they're looking for that all
[55:41] through the ages but i believe we are at
[55:44] the age when that fruit is at the top of
[55:47] the tree
[55:48] when that fruit is coming to life and
[55:50] it's bringing forth how do you know what
[55:51] kind of tree it is by the fruit that
[55:53] it's producing
[55:56] you know we we it seems like man as we
[55:58] go along in time and we go along in
[56:00] history and you just have to bear with
[56:02] me i hadn't
[56:03] i had planned on preaching something
[56:04] else and this morning i woke up and it
[56:06] was like an audible voice said to me
[56:08] preach this
[56:09] so i had to re-go back through these
[56:11] notes and refine the inspiration of it
[56:13] but the lord told me to preach this and
[56:15] then i found out during the song service
[56:17] why
[56:18] but i believe the lord has something in
[56:19] store for us
[56:21] but it seems like it's become a
[56:23] uh uh it's a billion dollar industry
[56:25] looking to see where you've come from
[56:28] you know 23 23andme or ancestry.com and
[56:31] everybody wants to know where they've
[56:33] come from what's their what's their
[56:34] makeup and what's their genetics and how
[56:36] do they get to be where they're at and a
[56:38] man is always questioning to know where
[56:40] he came from what's my history how did i
[56:43] get to where i'm at uh who was my dad
[56:45] and who was his dad and who where did
[56:47] they come from and uh you know my wife
[56:49] uh we got we the kids and i we got her
[56:51] for mother's day one of those 23andme
[56:53] things and so she sit back and uh you
[56:56] know she finds out she's from all over
[56:57] different places of the world and
[56:59] you know you might not know where you
[57:00] come from you said i'm kind of scared to
[57:02] send my dad i don't know where i've come
[57:03] from you know you think you're one thing
[57:05] and you find out you're something
[57:06] totally different
[57:10] but i believe as end time believers we
[57:12] didn't just start in some sub-saharan
[57:13] desert somewhere or some african jungle
[57:16] somewhere or some swedish uh uh glacier
[57:19] somewhere but i believe we had a
[57:21] beginning and i believe that that is the
[57:23] heart of man is to find his way back
[57:26] to where he came from because if he can
[57:28] find his way back to where he came from
[57:30] he knows where he's going from here he
[57:32] knows how he's going to get back to to
[57:35] end this circle of time
[57:37] i believe we've been given a direct line
[57:39] back to our our forefathers our
[57:41] forefathers did not start just a few
[57:44] hundred years ago when some ships came
[57:46] over here to this country but my
[57:48] forefathers started back in the little
[57:50] upper room back on the day of pentecost
[57:52] when they were caught up in one mind in
[57:54] one accord and they were all together
[57:56] gathered under one spirit of christ and
[57:58] there a generation was started and that
[58:01] generation still lives today in the
[58:03] believer to finish the work which was
[58:06] began back there in the upper room
[58:08] i'm not ashamed to tie myself you know
[58:10] as some people might find out that
[58:12] they're related to some criminal or some
[58:14] some mastermind back into and they might
[58:16] be ashamed to tie themselves to that
[58:18] i am not ashamed to tie myself back to
[58:20] my heritage i know where i came from i'm
[58:23] not ashamed to tie myself to a
[58:25] tongue-talking uh son of god acts
[58:27] believing working in the power of christ
[58:29] son of god i'm not ashamed to tie myself
[58:31] to that
[58:32] i know where i came from and there's no
[58:34] other way i'm gonna get back to where
[58:36] i'm going unless i see the line in which
[58:39] i came
[58:40] how did they get there i'll get there
[58:41] the same way how did so and so i'll get
[58:44] there the same way how did peter find it
[58:46] i'll get there the same way there's only
[58:48] one way to get back to life
[58:52] and it's through this message we will
[58:54] not find it any other way you would not
[58:56] find it through uh some denominational
[58:58] whim or or some thought of a man or some
[59:00] theology if that was gonna happen they
[59:02] would have found it ages ago but it's at
[59:04] the appointed time god will cause this
[59:07] bride to see herself in the word so
[59:10] clearly that she will manifest the fruit
[59:13] of it
[59:14] it won't be a question to her but
[59:15] there's one provided way
[59:18] back to that kingdom
[59:20] we're not from this kingdom of england
[59:22] or this kingdom of united states or but
[59:24] we're from an original kingdom
[59:26] it didn't have a beginning and it won't
[59:28] have an end i don't know about you
[59:30] church but that's excites me i'm not
[59:32] from this just this states here or just
[59:34] as far as i can travel there but i'm
[59:36] from another kingdom that will not have
[59:39] an end it didn't have a beginning and so
[59:41] i am part of that as it is part of me
[59:45] we're walking in that
[59:46] that's our inherited rights
[59:48] we have authority in that kingdom
[59:51] you know we used to used to try to blend
[59:53] in with other kingdoms right we should
[59:55] try to blend in that's why we don't feel
[59:56] at home when we go to walmart we're not
[59:58] from walmart
[1:00:00] that's why we don't feel at home when we
[1:00:01] go i yesterday we needed something from
[1:00:03] the store i googled dollar general close
[1:00:05] to joe's house and there was like 127
[1:00:07] red dots popped up on the map i said my
[1:00:10] there's more dollar generals here than
[1:00:11] there is people
[1:00:14] that's why we don't feel at home when we
[1:00:16] go to dollar general we're not from this
[1:00:17] kingdom
[1:00:18] we're not meant to blend in you know we
[1:00:20] used to play then when i was in high
[1:00:21] school i blended in with the rest of the
[1:00:22] football team
[1:00:24] when i was out in the world i bled tried
[1:00:26] to blend in with the rest of the world
[1:00:27] when i was when i was uh when i was a
[1:00:29] good hypocrite in the church i tried to
[1:00:31] blend in with the rest of the believers
[1:00:32] in the church
[1:00:34] but you see we're not meant to blend in
[1:00:35] with this world we're from another
[1:00:38] kingdom
[1:00:39] we've got to recognize why we believe
[1:00:41] what we believe
[1:00:43] that's a question that we all are going
[1:00:44] to ask right and i'm just building a
[1:00:47] foundation i hope i hope we're okay
[1:00:49] that's a question that we're all going
[1:00:50] to ask ourselves at one point why do we
[1:00:52] believe what we believe
[1:00:55] if this message is just codes and rules
[1:00:57] to you you miss something and this is
[1:00:59] just a way to live your life and your
[1:01:01] skirt's got to be just this long and
[1:01:02] your heels have got to be just this
[1:01:04] short and you're going to get away with
[1:01:05] just this much makeup or you can get
[1:01:07] away with just as much trimming your
[1:01:08] hair you've totally missed the point of
[1:01:11] why a prophet came he did not come just
[1:01:13] to tell us not to wear purple shoes he
[1:01:15] came to reveal christ in our day he came
[1:01:18] to reveal a living god in our hour that
[1:01:21] we can recognize that the same messiah
[1:01:23] is here today that was here 2000 years
[1:01:26] ago and he's living in flesh through you
[1:01:28] and i
[1:01:29] it's not just another set of rules to me
[1:01:32] it's not just an uh just a thing i have
[1:01:34] to follow but i'm so in love with this
[1:01:37] word that it's everything that i am
[1:01:39] it's my being it's my makeup it's the
[1:01:41] breath that i breathe this word is life
[1:01:43] to me it's not just a a creed or a
[1:01:46] theology but
[1:01:48] what do you say it is
[1:01:52] peter
[1:01:53] who what what do men say that i am
[1:01:56] well if you can only hear
[1:01:59] they would say this they would say that
[1:02:01] you know you're just uh you're just the
[1:02:03] son of
[1:02:04] of joseph and mary and you have no
[1:02:06] authority to be doing the things that
[1:02:08] you're doing
[1:02:09] hmm
[1:02:10] what did you say about it peter
[1:02:13] first he asked what do men say
[1:02:15] they said what about you as an
[1:02:16] individual
[1:02:17] what do you say that i am so that takes
[1:02:20] it down to another level for us we can't
[1:02:21] just say well the pastor preaches it
[1:02:23] like this
[1:02:24] or so and so believes it like this but
[1:02:26] what do you say as an individual about
[1:02:28] this christ that you've come in contact
[1:02:30] with what does it mean to you is it
[1:02:32] another set of rules or codes you'll end
[1:02:34] up in the side of the road somewhere
[1:02:35] you'll end up off in a ditch somewhere
[1:02:37] but you must see it as the living christ
[1:02:40] in this hour it is jesus manifest in a
[1:02:43] bride body walking talking preaching
[1:02:46] delivering saving healing the same works
[1:02:49] that he did shall you do also and
[1:02:51] greater
[1:02:52] works because there's more of us
[1:02:54] believing the same thing many messiahs
[1:02:56] right
[1:02:57] messiahs but some say this or that
[1:03:01] what do you say about this message
[1:03:06] i want you to really think about it
[1:03:08] what do you think about it
[1:03:10] what do you say it is
[1:03:12] what does it mean to you
[1:03:14] well some say that you know it brother
[1:03:16] bam's gonna have to come back and tie up
[1:03:18] all these all these loose ends
[1:03:20] some say that you know we're gonna be uh
[1:03:23] we're gonna have to go find a giant tent
[1:03:24] somewhere and meet there
[1:03:27] uh some say that he had good opinions
[1:03:29] you know but he had good while he was
[1:03:30] under prophecy but his opinions weren't
[1:03:32] any good
[1:03:34] some say well you can take this part but
[1:03:35] you have to leave this part out some say
[1:03:37] you can only quote what was after 1963.
[1:03:40] some say that you know he was uh he was
[1:03:42] influenced by the pentecostals and
[1:03:44] that's why he preached a moving of the
[1:03:45] spirit in the church
[1:03:47] some say he was a baptist by origin so
[1:03:49] that's why he preached
[1:03:51] you see but what do you say
[1:03:53] about this message what is it to you as
[1:03:56] an individual i could ask the name by
[1:03:57] name
[1:03:58] luis what is it to you and sister sister
[1:04:01] what is it to you you see name by name
[1:04:04] asking what does this message mean to
[1:04:06] you it's got to be more than just my
[1:04:08] daddy's religion or my pastor's religion
[1:04:10] or what what what i just i found a home
[1:04:12] here and they have love and they maybe
[1:04:14] they help me out financially it's got to
[1:04:16] be so much more than that you've got to
[1:04:18] recognize that this is the christ the
[1:04:21] son of the living god and upon this rock
[1:04:23] he has built his church he's not built
[1:04:25] his church upon branham tabernacle or
[1:04:28] the name associated with it but he built
[1:04:30] his church upon the revelation that
[1:04:32] christ is here that same revelation is
[1:04:36] laying within our hearts to recognize
[1:04:37] that jesus is walking among us
[1:04:40] look to your neighbor and say i see
[1:04:42] christ
[1:04:43] i see christ
[1:04:46] if we're if we don't believe that then
[1:04:47] why are we why are we believing what we
[1:04:49] are
[1:04:50] why are we sacrificing i don't have to
[1:04:52] pass the mic to ask you you have
[1:04:54] sacrificed to be in this building this
[1:04:56] morning you have made sacrifices and you
[1:04:59] have you have submitted yourself unto
[1:05:01] the word to be in this building this
[1:05:03] morning you have you have forsake
[1:05:04] friends you have forsaken family you
[1:05:06] have forsaken your own wants your own
[1:05:08] desires your own temptations
[1:05:10] you're here this morning
[1:05:12] somebody just touch yourself and say i'm
[1:05:14] here
[1:05:15] i'm here
[1:05:16] that's a mighty victory because satan
[1:05:18] would not let you hear unless you
[1:05:20] overcame something you would not be in
[1:05:23] this room this morning unless you had
[1:05:24] already overcome something you might
[1:05:26] feel that you're weak in faith and
[1:05:28] you're not gonna make another service
[1:05:29] but you're here this morning which means
[1:05:32] there's something greater in you than he
[1:05:34] that is in the world the spirit of truth
[1:05:37] brought you here
[1:05:38] you do not come here of your own accord
[1:05:40] or because you might think that your mom
[1:05:42] dragged you in here or your wife might
[1:05:44] be upset with you if you weren't here
[1:05:45] this morning but he the spirit of truth
[1:05:48] has brought you here
[1:05:51] sometimes we just need to pat ourselves
[1:05:52] in the back and say i'm still here
[1:05:55] i may feel weak in faith but i'm still
[1:05:57] here devil if i'm still here it means i
[1:06:00] still have breath in my lung and i can
[1:06:01] change the circumstance that i'm under
[1:06:05] i can change the situation i am i'm
[1:06:07] still here
[1:06:08] to think of it that that before before
[1:06:11] there ever was a trial we were here
[1:06:14] before there ever was a headache we were
[1:06:16] here before there ever was a diabetes we
[1:06:19] were here before there was cancer we
[1:06:21] were here before there was a depression
[1:06:23] we were here
[1:06:25] and we're still here
[1:06:28] because we come from somewhere eternal
[1:06:31] we're not settling for anything less
[1:06:32] than getting back to eternity i'm not
[1:06:34] settling for just a simple circuit on
[1:06:36] this earth given you know 70 80 90 years
[1:06:39] no i'm going back to eternity
[1:06:43] but i believe we feel in the air in this
[1:06:46] time that we're we're under a different
[1:06:47] dispensation
[1:06:49] i know you feel it i know we all feel
[1:06:51] that the the we're being called to a
[1:06:53] higher level
[1:06:54] than we were last year than we were the
[1:06:57] year before we're being called under a
[1:06:59] different anointing there's there's a
[1:07:00] different feeling in the air we used to
[1:07:02] sing this song back in the church
[1:07:03] there's a feeling in the air and god is
[1:07:05] everywhere and his resurrection power is
[1:07:08] moving in this hour that song didn't
[1:07:11] make any sense to me when i used to sing
[1:07:12] it 25 years ago but today i recognize
[1:07:15] there's a feeling in the air
[1:07:17] his resurrection power is manifesting
[1:07:20] itself through the body of believers in
[1:07:22] this hour
[1:07:24] we're called to be higher than we were
[1:07:26] last year we're getting called up to
[1:07:28] believe more than we did last year to to
[1:07:30] use our faith more than we did last year
[1:07:32] we can't just rely on some old
[1:07:34] experience
[1:07:36] god forbid
[1:07:38] that we would come to a message church
[1:07:40] for 15 years
[1:07:42] and realize we've never been born again
[1:07:45] god forbid we come and hear the truth a
[1:07:47] service after service for 20 years
[1:07:51] and then when they realized that we
[1:07:52] never really went all the way
[1:07:54] we never really anchored our soul in
[1:07:56] that haven of rest
[1:07:58] god forbid that would happen but you're
[1:08:00] still here this morning so you have you
[1:08:03] have the breath to change that situation
[1:08:06] you have the mindset to say i realize
[1:08:09] that there is something happening around
[1:08:10] me that there's a change happening i
[1:08:12] don't want to miss getting in that in
[1:08:14] that whirlwind i don't want to miss
[1:08:16] getting under that anointing i don't
[1:08:17] want to miss getting under this rapture
[1:08:19] anointing
[1:08:20] there's something calling you you know
[1:08:21] you would not feel that if the lord was
[1:08:23] not calling you
[1:08:26] i think we could probably say hey nobody
[1:08:28] in here wants to miss the rapture
[1:08:30] anybody here want to miss the rapture
[1:08:32] there's something in you that's that's
[1:08:34] that's that's destined
[1:08:39] the greatest overcoming will be the
[1:08:41] changing of our bodies
[1:08:44] that's when you know you've made it
[1:08:46] that's when you know you made it all the
[1:08:47] way but we have an earnest expectation
[1:08:50] of that now we can feel the elements
[1:08:53] around us changing now
[1:08:55] we feel the resurrection power moving in
[1:08:57] the room now we are recognizing that he
[1:09:00] is here now we're not waiting for
[1:09:02] something but this is another season
[1:09:05] right through every age there was a
[1:09:06] season there was a season under luther
[1:09:08] and season
[1:09:11] to pentecost
[1:09:13] but now we're living under another
[1:09:14] season
[1:09:16] it's our season
[1:09:18] this is your season uh we used to say i
[1:09:20] hear this song back in the in the old
[1:09:23] church it's our season to be blessed
[1:09:25] he's gonna open up the windows
[1:09:28] he's gonna pour out our blessings it's
[1:09:30] our season to be blessed
[1:09:32] when did it become normal for the
[1:09:34] christian church just to lay back and
[1:09:36] say hey ah this is not my season to be
[1:09:38] blessed i've just got to go through this
[1:09:40] no it's your season for victory somebody
[1:09:42] say my season
[1:09:44] my season
[1:09:45] you were here before the trial you're
[1:09:47] going through
[1:09:48] you were in the mind of god before that
[1:09:50] trial you're going through when when god
[1:09:52] in his infinite wisdom thought of this
[1:09:54] time and he thought what it would take
[1:09:56] to make an overcomer that's when you
[1:09:58] came into the mind of god before there
[1:09:59] ever was a time back in the we're
[1:10:01] talking way back in the mind of elohim
[1:10:03] you can go back and listen to the
[1:10:04] adoption series brother branham covers
[1:10:06] it way back in the mind of elohim
[1:10:09] when he's thinking of the final final
[1:10:11] hour where the finishers would finish
[1:10:13] the work he's thinking of you brother
[1:10:15] bob
[1:10:16] he's thinking of you brother error he's
[1:10:18] thinking of finishers
[1:10:21] and there we come into the mind of god
[1:10:24] to be put into this age
[1:10:27] god did not put you in this age so you
[1:10:28] could fail god put you in this age and
[1:10:31] he predestinated you with every resource
[1:10:34] you need to overcome in this hour
[1:10:36] everything that you have need of is
[1:10:37] already laying within you remember
[1:10:39] brother branham said it
[1:10:40] everything that we have need of has
[1:10:42] already been preached it's already been
[1:10:44] poured out we're not waiting for it to
[1:10:46] come it's already here but in the right
[1:10:48] season
[1:10:50] it comes to life
[1:10:52] i think we kind of maybe touched on that
[1:10:54] yesterday
[1:10:55] you know this the sun in march and the
[1:10:57] sun in april is not a harvest sun
[1:10:59] but they're in august
[1:11:02] but you know the thing about an august
[1:11:03] sun is it's hot
[1:11:06] it's really hot
[1:11:07] and it's hard to stay under that sun
[1:11:11] it's hard to stay under the anointing
[1:11:13] it's hard to stay under this word
[1:11:16] it's hard to give away your headship to
[1:11:17] this word it's hard to let your flesh
[1:11:19] fall away and let your own desires fall
[1:11:22] away and the closer we get to harvest
[1:11:24] season the hotter that sun gets
[1:11:26] the hotter that sun causes that seed to
[1:11:29] come forth out of the shuck the the
[1:11:31] closer we get but it's in due season
[1:11:34] right
[1:11:35] proverbs the 15th chapter would say a
[1:11:36] man hath joy by the answer of his mouth
[1:11:39] and a word spoken in due season how good
[1:11:43] is it
[1:11:44] to have a word in due season
[1:11:47] to recognize you're living in the right
[1:11:48] hour you're living at the right time you
[1:11:51] have the right word and you are the
[1:11:53] right person
[1:11:55] to recognize those things is the key to
[1:11:56] victory to recognize this is talking
[1:11:59] about you
[1:12:00] don't come to me and tell me why i'm
[1:12:01] weak in faith and you don't know the
[1:12:03] struggles i've gone through we could
[1:12:04] pass the mic everybody in here had
[1:12:06] struggles to get here this morning
[1:12:08] everybody had to overcome their flesh to
[1:12:10] get here this morning everybody had to
[1:12:11] get out of bed tired and soar and they
[1:12:13] just want to go back to sleep everybody
[1:12:15] had to overcome something to get here
[1:12:17] this morning don't tell me about your
[1:12:19] struggles but tell me that you see
[1:12:21] yourself in the word overcoming
[1:12:24] remember in the prayer line something as
[1:12:25] simple as this brother brandon would
[1:12:27] have somebody come and he would say i
[1:12:29] see a dark shadow over you and it's
[1:12:31] death it's a death sentence but he said
[1:12:33] don't worry i see you healed on the
[1:12:35] other side of the line somewhere between
[1:12:38] here and there i see that dark shadow
[1:12:40] removing off of you that's our walk with
[1:12:42] christ somewhere between now and a
[1:12:45] rapture that dark shadow is being
[1:12:47] removed off of us we've got to recognize
[1:12:49] we are the ones walking in that vision
[1:12:52] it's talking about us
[1:12:56] we've got to recognize we're living in
[1:12:58] in the perfect age we're living at the
[1:13:00] right time that god created us for
[1:13:03] now we think about it we we want to want
[1:13:05] to separate things and pull apart things
[1:13:07] but let me say that you've got to take
[1:13:09] the whole word
[1:13:11] you've got to take all of it you've got
[1:13:13] to take the parts that you don't care
[1:13:14] for
[1:13:15] you've got to take the parts that you
[1:13:16] love
[1:13:17] you've got to take all the word
[1:13:20] to get a fullness of a change
[1:13:22] i believe that's what we're looking for
[1:13:23] is that all right
[1:13:26] all right
[1:13:27] all right so we've laid a foundation
[1:13:28] right
[1:13:29] in your season
[1:13:31] can't be blessed
[1:13:33] unless you're in your season right
[1:13:34] israel couldn't be blessed until they
[1:13:36] were in their land they could be blessed
[1:13:38] until it was at the right time under the
[1:13:39] right anointing and the authority was
[1:13:41] given as soon as they came under that
[1:13:43] headship of that season we are in a
[1:13:46] season of rapture this is the season of
[1:13:49] the manifestation of all things where
[1:13:51] the sons of god come to fullness of
[1:13:53] manifestation that's the season that we
[1:13:56] live in it's not for another age
[1:13:59] all that was there at pentecost we have
[1:14:01] that and more
[1:14:02] you know the thing about azusa street is
[1:14:04] they didn't have the mechanics that we
[1:14:06] have today
[1:14:08] when azusa broke out they had the
[1:14:10] dynamics in the church but the prophet
[1:14:12] had not yet come so they did not have
[1:14:15] the mechanics that we have but it seems
[1:14:17] like through men and through ages that
[1:14:20] have gone by that men had kind of
[1:14:22] wearied away from the the dynamics of
[1:14:24] the church and they majored on the
[1:14:26] mechanics and there uh things were where
[1:14:28] were taught so heavy and taught so deep
[1:14:30] and it was laying a foundation
[1:14:33] for what
[1:14:34] for this hour when the dynamics would
[1:14:37] come back into the church and now it's
[1:14:38] not the same don't be afraid that we're
[1:14:40] going to end up like azusa when azusa
[1:14:42] opened up the prophet had not yet come
[1:14:45] but now we have a perfect word and the
[1:14:48] foundation's been laid and the teaching
[1:14:50] has been established and the ministry
[1:14:51] has laid it out waiting for the dynamics
[1:14:54] to strike
[1:14:56] i believe we're at that age
[1:14:58] i believe we're at that time we are
[1:15:00] turning a corner in this thing you know
[1:15:03] as as you're building a pyramid you know
[1:15:05] in in building a house you just lay a
[1:15:07] wall
[1:15:08] and then you turn a corner
[1:15:10] and you lay wall
[1:15:12] you turn the corner you lay a wall
[1:15:14] but when you're building a pyramid every
[1:15:16] time you turn a corner
[1:15:18] it gets shorter
[1:15:20] and that wall gets shorter
[1:15:21] and that corner comes faster and that
[1:15:23] corner comes faster and faster and
[1:15:25] faster and as we're getting to the top
[1:15:27] of this thing we are turning corners
[1:15:29] from service to service what we believe
[1:15:31] last year seems uh it's just it's a it's
[1:15:33] just a a thing of the past but now we
[1:15:36] are living in the sun
[1:15:37] the ripening of the seed living in the
[1:15:39] sun
[1:15:41] john 16 would say i have yet many things
[1:15:43] to say unto you but you cannot bear them
[1:15:46] now
[1:15:47] howbeit when he the spirit of truth has
[1:15:50] come he will guide you into
[1:15:52] all truth for he shall not speak of
[1:15:55] himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[1:15:57] that shall he speak and he will show you
[1:15:59] things to come he shall glorify me for
[1:16:02] he shall receive of mine and shall show
[1:16:05] it unto you
[1:16:06] in the amplified it says he shall take
[1:16:09] of my thoughts and reveal them unto you
[1:16:15] that's powerful
[1:16:17] all things that the father hath our mind
[1:16:19] therefore said i that he shall take of
[1:16:22] mine and shall show it unto you jesus is
[1:16:24] saying his thoughts
[1:16:26] are my thoughts
[1:16:28] i'll not leave you
[1:16:30] i'll not forsake you
[1:16:32] i'll be with you even in you
[1:16:35] i won't lose one of mine
[1:16:37] all that is his is mine and all that is
[1:16:40] mine is his a little while and you shall
[1:16:42] not see me and again a little while you
[1:16:44] shall see me
[1:16:45] because i go to the father
[1:16:50] friends we will not make access to this
[1:16:52] without the holy ghost
[1:16:55] without the spirit of truth it's always
[1:16:57] going to remain head knowledge you can
[1:16:59] you can decipher it you can break it
[1:17:00] down you can draw a graph you can you
[1:17:02] can have a diagram you can do a uh just
[1:17:06] a parallel uh uh comparison of it but
[1:17:09] it's always going to stay up here
[1:17:10] without the holy ghost it's always going
[1:17:12] to remain up here as a head knowledge
[1:17:14] unless he the spirit of truth shall come
[1:17:16] and reveal unto you all things
[1:17:20] you might know all things in your head
[1:17:22] but when he comes it's revealed unto
[1:17:24] your heart then it becomes a reality to
[1:17:26] you and you know what i'm saying to you
[1:17:28] is the gospel true because you recognize
[1:17:30] that same word
[1:17:32] that same i heard the prophet say that i
[1:17:34] heard the scriptures say that i
[1:17:36] recognize that as me i recognize that in
[1:17:38] my my being
[1:17:39] it's everything that you are when he the
[1:17:42] spirit of truth has come but there's
[1:17:44] only one way to get back there
[1:17:46] men for 2 000 years have tried to get
[1:17:48] back access into that
[1:17:50] even longer than that there when those
[1:17:53] bloody lambskins were slapping
[1:17:55] and they tried to get access back into
[1:17:57] that eternity but you and i are on the
[1:18:00] threshold of stepping into that eternity
[1:18:02] of just taking one more step right into
[1:18:05] that perfect walk with god
[1:18:07] we're men for for for the beginning of
[1:18:09] time
[1:18:10] has tried to get access into that but
[1:18:13] there's only one
[1:18:15] way
[1:18:16] back
[1:18:17] it's through the message
[1:18:19] it's not through the the your
[1:18:21] interpretation of the message
[1:18:23] it's through the pure word of the
[1:18:26] message
[1:18:27] in this hour that is what we are living
[1:18:29] that's why the devil's trying to steal
[1:18:30] the power out of the church that's why
[1:18:32] the devil's trying to keep the holy
[1:18:34] ghost out of the pulpit
[1:18:37] am i okay
[1:18:39] nothing makes me more upset than to hear
[1:18:41] a preacher come up and try to get the
[1:18:42] power of the holy ghost out of the
[1:18:44] pulpit
[1:18:45] if there's anything that's going to set
[1:18:46] your kids free it's the power of the
[1:18:48] holy ghost if there's anything that's
[1:18:50] going to bring that prodigal back it's
[1:18:51] the power of the holy ghost if there's
[1:18:53] anything that's going to make this a
[1:18:54] living word unto you it is the power of
[1:18:57] the holy ghost how dare a man come
[1:18:59] behind the pulpit and try to remove that
[1:19:01] power from the church you don't need
[1:19:04] great powerful to discernment to decide
[1:19:06] whether that's a god-called man or not
[1:19:08] any ministry that tries to take the holy
[1:19:10] ghost out of the word is a man's
[1:19:12] ministry
[1:19:14] you don't need discernment to decide
[1:19:16] what's going on here
[1:19:18] we've got to have the holy ghost in the
[1:19:19] church without it what are we gathering
[1:19:21] for without it what are we coming are we
[1:19:23] singing songs without the power of the
[1:19:24] holy ghost in here oh my god my i think
[1:19:28] where would i be without the power of
[1:19:29] the holy ghost
[1:19:30] what would i be doing
[1:19:32] we can we can we could say that we have
[1:19:34] a discerning spirit
[1:19:36] but oftentimes we find it's just a
[1:19:38] critical spirit
[1:19:40] you know and we'll just compare this
[1:19:41] quote with that well he missed it there
[1:19:43] and he misrepresented there but what is
[1:19:45] he preaching
[1:19:46] what is he getting to what is he trying
[1:19:48] to lead you to it you know we get so
[1:19:50] caught up sometimes i'm making sure the
[1:19:52] the eyes are dotted and the t's are
[1:19:54] crossed
[1:19:55] that we miss the very coming of the son
[1:19:57] of man
[1:19:58] that we've missed the very coming of the
[1:19:59] holy ghost in our midst because we're so
[1:20:01] concerned with with everything going on
[1:20:03] around us and you know the pharisees
[1:20:04] were concerned with the same thing
[1:20:07] they were so upset that he healed a girl
[1:20:09] on the wrong day they totally missed the
[1:20:11] miracle that happened in front of him
[1:20:13] they totally missed that he healed that
[1:20:15] girl because it was on the wrong day
[1:20:17] according to their knowledge
[1:20:19] they didn't receive the miracle that
[1:20:21] took place before him
[1:20:23] god forbid that we would do the same
[1:20:25] thing to be so caught up under this
[1:20:27] under this uh uh
[1:20:29] overtime discernment
[1:20:30] that we're trying to make sure oh we
[1:20:32] don't want to we don't want to take a
[1:20:33] bite of the wrong thing but in the
[1:20:35] meantime the miracle has come
[1:20:37] and we've missed it
[1:20:39] well surely elias must first come
[1:20:41] he's already come
[1:20:43] he already showed his signs unto you he
[1:20:45] already manifested himself unto you and
[1:20:47] you missed it
[1:20:49] but i thank god that we have a sure word
[1:20:51] that we didn't miss it in this hour we
[1:20:53] didn't miss this coming we didn't miss
[1:20:54] this day of visitation it's happening
[1:20:57] right now somebody just passed yourself
[1:20:59] and say i'm still here
[1:21:01] i'm still here i didn't miss it i didn't
[1:21:04] miss it i woke up this morning i thank
[1:21:06] god i have breath in my lungs i didn't
[1:21:08] miss it i'm still here i can still
[1:21:11] receive it i can still get back on track
[1:21:13] i can get back to life
[1:21:16] and if you're already walking in the way
[1:21:17] of life onward christian soldier
[1:21:20] marching as to war
[1:21:22] let's take this word and march on not
[1:21:24] waiting for something to come this is
[1:21:26] the season for it
[1:21:29] i don't need you to interpret me god is
[1:21:30] his own interpreter of his own word i
[1:21:32] don't need you to tell me where i'm
[1:21:34] going his word has already told me where
[1:21:36] i'm going and i see myself in that word
[1:21:40] it's of no private interpretation i see
[1:21:42] myself there
[1:21:43] i'm a written epistle written and read
[1:21:45] of all men
[1:21:46] walking in the word
[1:21:48] that's why we believe this it's not a
[1:21:50] man's interpretation or inspiration
[1:21:53] he's already come
[1:21:55] if you didn't know my father
[1:21:56] you to know me
[1:22:03] there's elements within you
[1:22:05] that were not in generations gone by
[1:22:08] there's pieces within you that god
[1:22:09] placed and deposited in this hour
[1:22:13] whatever they are
[1:22:14] to change your very elements
[1:22:17] my me yeah you
[1:22:19] you weak in faith yeah you
[1:22:21] you was unsure why you're here yeah you
[1:22:24] there's something within you
[1:22:26] that will change the very elements in
[1:22:28] your body
[1:22:30] i don't know about you but the older i
[1:22:31] get
[1:22:32] the more i look forward to that
[1:22:36] just one day
[1:22:38] the anointing will just be caught up
[1:22:41] we'll be caught up into heavenly places
[1:22:43] with christ jesus
[1:22:44] friends it's not a fairy tale it's not a
[1:22:47] myth
[1:22:47] but i believe there are some standing
[1:22:50] here which shall not taste of death but
[1:22:52] they shall be changed in the moment in
[1:22:54] the twinkling of an eye our very bodies
[1:22:57] will be changed why do we believe what
[1:22:59] we believe we believe this because we
[1:23:01] believe in a rapture
[1:23:03] we believe in the coming of the son of
[1:23:04] man to change our very bodies
[1:23:07] into a perfect body
[1:23:09] i have glorified it and i will glorify
[1:23:12] it again
[1:23:13] that's why we believe what we believe
[1:23:17] you can't give up if you tried
[1:23:20] i'll not lose one of mine
[1:23:23] i'll not lose one there's some running
[1:23:25] as hard as they can god will get them he
[1:23:28] will not lose one of his he will not
[1:23:30] leave a hoof behind he will not leave
[1:23:32] them out in a ditch somewhere but all
[1:23:34] that is mine will come unto me
[1:23:38] i tried it
[1:23:39] brother wade i tried it i tried to run i
[1:23:42] tried to take off and say hey you can
[1:23:43] have this religion
[1:23:46] but something keeps holding me
[1:23:50] every day i see
[1:23:54] what is it there's something deposited
[1:23:56] within you that you can't help but come
[1:23:58] here you couldn't help but bring
[1:24:00] yourself to the house of god this
[1:24:01] morning you can't help but bring
[1:24:03] yourself under this word you can't help
[1:24:04] it because there's something within you
[1:24:07] that's pulling on you it's drawing on
[1:24:09] you all that coming to me the father has
[1:24:11] drawn them
[1:24:12] he's drawing you but what is he drawing
[1:24:14] you for he's drawing you to walk in the
[1:24:17] perfect word under a perfect light under
[1:24:19] a perfect revelation because you're a
[1:24:21] perfect people
[1:24:23] my i think the devil does a good job of
[1:24:25] telling us how how weak we are i think
[1:24:27] it's time to turn the word around and
[1:24:28] tell them how strong we are tell them
[1:24:30] how mighty we are if the weakest
[1:24:32] christian can get on his knees and every
[1:24:34] demon runs for cover how about somebody
[1:24:37] who's positionally placed in the body
[1:24:38] when when somebody who knows that
[1:24:40] they're a manifested son of god gets on
[1:24:42] his knees oh my the very the very devil
[1:24:46] himself shakes in his boots
[1:24:48] because he knows we know
[1:24:50] hey the gig is up
[1:24:52] you see all this time through time he's
[1:24:54] not known what's going on with us
[1:24:56] what keeps driving them
[1:24:59] i put so many roadblocks in front of
[1:25:00] brother luis why is he why is he still
[1:25:02] going
[1:25:04] what's the deal yeah i guess i'll have
[1:25:06] to hit him again
[1:25:08] and here he is
[1:25:11] i again so many roadblocks in front of
[1:25:13] zach why is he still here
[1:25:15] here he is
[1:25:17] you see he doesn't see what's going on
[1:25:19] inside you
[1:25:20] there's another conversation taking
[1:25:22] place
[1:25:23] there's another relationship taking
[1:25:25] place you know he doesn't know he's
[1:25:26] maybe gathered around here wondering
[1:25:28] what is the attraction inside
[1:25:30] inside 6467 main street
[1:25:35] he doesn't know why we're all gathered
[1:25:36] in here
[1:25:37] to him is just a booming thunder and
[1:25:39] some people getting excited and you know
[1:25:41] some words being spoken but he doesn't
[1:25:43] recognize the relationship
[1:25:45] taking place
[1:25:47] the transformation
[1:25:48] taking place what is the attraction on
[1:25:51] the mountain what is the attraction
[1:25:53] inside this little tabernacle in here
[1:25:55] this morning you see to him it just
[1:25:56] looks like uh you're just you're gonna
[1:25:58] fail tomorrow as hard as you did
[1:25:59] yesterday but to you and i there's
[1:26:01] another conversation taking place
[1:26:04] that we know where we're going we know
[1:26:06] how we're going to get back there we
[1:26:08] know by faith he will see us through
[1:26:11] he's not going to forsake us he's not
[1:26:12] going to leave us he's not going to just
[1:26:14] put us on the side of the road
[1:26:16] but the prescription is the same it was
[1:26:19] back in the upper room
[1:26:20] if we can get in one mind one accord the
[1:26:23] same thing will happen
[1:26:25] and we wonder sometimes why we don't
[1:26:27] have a revival in our life that's the
[1:26:28] same prescription that it was back there
[1:26:30] in the upper room by one mind one accord
[1:26:33] it will be the same but you see you've
[1:26:36] got to recognize the season we're in
[1:26:38] we're coming into a rapture season
[1:26:40] this is the season of life this is the
[1:26:43] season where we're going to make
[1:26:44] manifest and show our colors of what we
[1:26:46] are was the theme of the year
[1:26:48] whatever it is let it out
[1:26:50] this is the season to let it out you're
[1:26:52] going to let out your fruit no matter
[1:26:54] what it is if it's false you're going to
[1:26:55] let it out if it's a true fruit you're
[1:26:57] going to let it out if
[1:26:58] it's a manifested son of god you're
[1:27:00] going to let it out the sun is ripening
[1:27:03] over the seed it's going to let it out
[1:27:05] it's going to come out it's going to
[1:27:07] bring forth the life that's within it
[1:27:09] that's the only way you can tell what
[1:27:11] kind of tree it is it'll produce it
[1:27:14] it'll make the hard choices it'll make
[1:27:16] the heart changes in your life
[1:27:18] god it's hard sometimes to follow under
[1:27:20] this anointing but ramp said i labor to
[1:27:23] stay under this anointing so that i can
[1:27:26] see where the message is today
[1:27:30] take that home and think about it
[1:27:32] see where it is today
[1:27:35] right now
[1:27:36] where is that anointing right now i want
[1:27:38] to get under it
[1:27:40] i don't want to just come to church and
[1:27:41] realize that i spent 50 years of my life
[1:27:43] sitting in a pew and it didn't mean
[1:27:44] anything
[1:27:45] why come this far and give up now
[1:27:47] why come all this way and just turn it
[1:27:49] away now why not just take the next step
[1:27:51] and enter all the way in to that
[1:27:53] shekinah glory where you know you're
[1:27:56] secure you're anchored you're going home
[1:27:59] it's as good as it's as good as getting
[1:28:00] on the train
[1:28:02] that ticket is just as good as stepping
[1:28:04] on the train
[1:28:06] it's the earnest of it
[1:28:08] excuse me
[1:28:10] but there's something within us
[1:28:12] we cannot deny it as that sun begins to
[1:28:15] move over us it begins to come out
[1:28:17] here a few months ago
[1:28:18] i was uh i was at brother schumacher's
[1:28:20] church remember the shoemaker up in
[1:28:22] pennsylvania and at the time i happened
[1:28:24] to be there they have a sugar shack
[1:28:26] right and they make syrup and the time i
[1:28:28] was there was a syrup day so the day
[1:28:30] before church we had spent the we spent
[1:28:32] the day in the sugar shack and they were
[1:28:33] boiling it and boiling it and they have
[1:28:35] this big sophisticated machine and they
[1:28:37] pour this sap into there and it takes
[1:28:39] all the sap and it boils it down to this
[1:28:41] chamber and boils it down to that
[1:28:42] chamber i don't know if honey's made the
[1:28:43] same or how it's made something like
[1:28:45] that but they come down it comes down
[1:28:47] and comes down and by the time it comes
[1:28:49] out you open the valve and
[1:28:51] it's syrup
[1:28:52] and it's good
[1:28:55] but you see through the course of the
[1:28:56] process
[1:28:58] all of the impurities were boiled out
[1:29:01] through the course of pouring that sap
[1:29:02] into there all of the impurities were
[1:29:04] boiled and boiled and transferred and
[1:29:06] boiled and transferred and boiled and
[1:29:08] he's got an automated setup when that
[1:29:10] thermometer hits
[1:29:11] 122.4 degrees
[1:29:15] the valve opens
[1:29:16] and now comes syrup
[1:29:19] god knows what he's doing
[1:29:21] he's not left you on the fire too long
[1:29:23] he knows what he's doing he's boiling
[1:29:26] out all of the impurities
[1:29:28] until you can make sweet syrup
[1:29:30] when all the impurities are gone then
[1:29:32] it's time to open the valve but you see
[1:29:34] there's some intelligence within that
[1:29:36] tree
[1:29:37] that pushes the sap up
[1:29:39] i thought it was pretty remarkable maybe
[1:29:41] i'm just dumb but i thought it was
[1:29:42] pretty remarkable there's there's an
[1:29:45] intelligence within that tree that they
[1:29:46] tap that tap into that tree
[1:29:49] and there it is all year
[1:29:51] and there's no sap coming out of it
[1:29:53] all winter
[1:29:54] no sap
[1:29:56] no sap leaves are gone no life seemingly
[1:29:59] in the tree
[1:30:01] but then there's a change of season
[1:30:04] in that old winter frost begins to die
[1:30:06] off
[1:30:07] and that old frost begins to fall off
[1:30:09] the tree and that sun begins to show
[1:30:11] itself there there in northern
[1:30:12] pennsylvania there's some there's some
[1:30:14] winter times where you don't see the sun
[1:30:16] that sun begins to show itself again it
[1:30:18] begins to crest over the hill and that
[1:30:20] tree something within that tree knows
[1:30:23] it's time to produce life it's time to
[1:30:26] push the sap up
[1:30:28] out of the roots and up into the tree
[1:30:35] what what intelligence told that tree to
[1:30:37] do that
[1:30:39] it's built in it
[1:30:41] where was that sap all winter
[1:30:45] so if you're a tree
[1:30:48] you be a tree with me for a minute if
[1:30:50] you're a tree
[1:30:52] in northern pennsylvania
[1:30:54] and there you all this time of year
[1:30:56] you're beautiful and you're green and oh
[1:30:58] my you've just produced your harvest and
[1:31:00] it's just a wonderful time and but then
[1:31:02] there's a change in the air
[1:31:05] and the sun's not coming up as early as
[1:31:07] it used to
[1:31:08] and your leaves begin to change color
[1:31:10] and they begin to fall and they begin to
[1:31:12] wither and there you were a beautiful
[1:31:14] tree and all of a sudden now there's
[1:31:17] barely a leaf on you
[1:31:19] nothing there just a just a dry old
[1:31:21] branch
[1:31:23] and that sun
[1:31:24] hides its face
[1:31:26] you don't see that sun much anymore
[1:31:30] but then all of a sudden there's a
[1:31:32] change in the air
[1:31:36] all of a sudden there's another wind
[1:31:37] blowing by
[1:31:39] and you feel a little bit of warmth in
[1:31:40] the air and you feel a little bit of
[1:31:41] different difference in the air and you
[1:31:43] feel that the pressure in the altitude
[1:31:45] is changing the pressure in the
[1:31:46] atmosphere is changing there's there's a
[1:31:48] difference happening
[1:31:51] you can't help but produce leaves
[1:31:54] you can't help it but where was that
[1:31:56] life the whole winter where was that
[1:31:58] life all winter long it was down in the
[1:32:00] roots
[1:32:01] it was down inside those roots and at
[1:32:03] the right time under the right season
[1:32:05] under the right anointing that life
[1:32:08] comes out of those roots and begins to
[1:32:09] pop forth life
[1:32:13] leaves fruit leaves fruit leaves fruit
[1:32:15] seems like overnight a tree will just
[1:32:16] bloom into a full full leaves
[1:32:19] what is it there's a life inside of it
[1:32:20] that knows it's time to produce i
[1:32:23] believe the church is coming to that
[1:32:25] time of life where we know it's time to
[1:32:27] produce where maybe our sap's been down
[1:32:30] in the roots for years and years but
[1:32:31] there's a changing of the sun it's time
[1:32:34] to produce the fruit
[1:32:36] it's time to produce the life it's
[1:32:37] already within you the intelligence
[1:32:40] within you tells you what is it it's he
[1:32:43] the spirit of truth
[1:32:45] he's saying it's time to produce it it's
[1:32:47] time to produce it it's the hour for it
[1:32:50] don't hold it back it's the hour for it
[1:32:54] it's the time
[1:32:56] you want a quote on this
[1:32:58] sure okay the roman caterpillar started
[1:33:00] eating on that bride tree and took it
[1:33:02] all the way to the roots cut it all the
[1:33:04] way back everything cut the tree right
[1:33:06] off like he did christ the bridegroom
[1:33:09] cut the bride right down and started out
[1:33:11] in creeds and denominations the same old
[1:33:14] bug but what all glory but in its roots
[1:33:16] was the predestinated seed
[1:33:20] in our roots is a predestinated seed
[1:33:23] mine that does something to me because
[1:33:24] it tells me i'm gonna make it in my
[1:33:27] roots there's a predestinated seed the
[1:33:29] royal seed of abraham it could not die
[1:33:33] though you couldn't feel it sometimes it
[1:33:35] could not die though you didn't know it
[1:33:37] was there it could not die even though
[1:33:39] you didn't see it working it could not
[1:33:41] die there's a predestinated seed within
[1:33:43] you that cannot die
[1:33:46] satan can't have it he doesn't have
[1:33:48] access to it there's something greater
[1:33:49] within you the devil can't touch it
[1:33:53] the word was in the roots with the
[1:33:56] promise
[1:33:59] now i wish i would have given him my
[1:34:00] quote to put up the word
[1:34:02] was in the roots with the promise
[1:34:06] i will restore saith the lord all the
[1:34:09] years that the caterpillar cut off all
[1:34:12] the locusts eating all the rest of the
[1:34:13] bugs eat up i will restore it back thus
[1:34:17] saith the lord
[1:34:20] my that should do something to us
[1:34:22] i will restore all the years that you've
[1:34:24] just been a good church sinner i'll
[1:34:26] restore all the years that you feel the
[1:34:27] devil is taken from your joy and giving
[1:34:29] you depression and taking you out of the
[1:34:31] out of the life and the love of god i
[1:34:34] will restore all the years back unto you
[1:34:38] it's a promise
[1:34:39] it's laying within you the life is
[1:34:42] already in you
[1:34:44] rapturing faith is not going to come
[1:34:45] into you it's already in you
[1:34:48] but under the right season and
[1:34:49] dispensation it draws it out of us
[1:34:52] it draws it up out of us those years
[1:34:54] that you spent playing around with the
[1:34:56] devil he'll restore those years it's
[1:34:58] drawing it up out of you
[1:35:00] it's the drawing power of the word
[1:35:03] my goodness to think
[1:35:06] you probably did not wake up and look at
[1:35:08] yourself in the mirror this morning and
[1:35:09] think i'm a spiritual king
[1:35:13] i'm a king of a kingdom
[1:35:16] if you're like me look at the mirror
[1:35:22] but what does god see
[1:35:25] what is that life in you
[1:35:27] produce
[1:35:28] my why are we believing this friends
[1:35:31] it's just some rules that make us feel
[1:35:32] good some good morals for our kids to
[1:35:34] live by
[1:35:35] this is resurrection power it's in the
[1:35:38] word it's in our roots that's why we
[1:35:41] believe it's down in there sometimes you
[1:35:43] can't feel it sometimes you're unaware
[1:35:45] it's there but that life is in your
[1:35:47] roots
[1:35:48] just get out of the anointing long
[1:35:49] enough for it to come up and let it
[1:35:51] blossom and let it manifest itself and
[1:35:53] you'll be able to say i know i'm a
[1:35:55] spiritual king now i'm a king and priest
[1:35:58] now i know i have adoption authority now
[1:36:00] i know i'm walking in step with the word
[1:36:04] my you're a prophecy you're gonna come
[1:36:06] to pass god forbid that somebody else
[1:36:08] down the street would be able to say i
[1:36:10] am the lulu revival
[1:36:14] right
[1:36:16] some somebody from africa fly over here
[1:36:18] and say hey brother wade where's the
[1:36:19] lulu revival
[1:36:21] i'm the lulu revival you're looking at
[1:36:23] it this is where it is this is where
[1:36:25] it's happening don't say oh so-and-so is
[1:36:28] here you ought to meet so and so he's on
[1:36:30] fire i am the revival happening in lula
[1:36:33] georgia
[1:36:34] we've got to recognize this is happening
[1:36:36] in our midst this is an event
[1:36:39] we're not waiting for an event to come
[1:36:40] the event has already come
[1:36:43] this is the rapture
[1:36:45] us taking the word in fullness
[1:36:47] eating the book
[1:36:49] becoming the word
[1:36:50] living it out my i think it should be
[1:36:53] more than just a just a nice quote that
[1:36:55] makes you feel good but it should be a
[1:36:57] life lived not just on sunday morning
[1:37:00] when you feel good but through the week
[1:37:01] of life lived
[1:37:03] that if he should come
[1:37:06] he's coming for you if he should come
[1:37:08] tonight he's coming for you if he should
[1:37:10] come right now he's coming for you
[1:37:13] a life lived to know there's a
[1:37:14] relationship there
[1:37:16] my
[1:37:18] there's such a love
[1:37:21] i don't want to i would i would i'd
[1:37:23] rather die than hurt the lord
[1:37:25] that kind of love
[1:37:27] remember brother man would say i don't
[1:37:28] when i leave overseas i don't you know
[1:37:30] my wife doesn't say now now now bill
[1:37:33] you will not talk to another woman
[1:37:36] you will not you will not fellowship
[1:37:38] with another woman
[1:37:39] you won't write letters to another woman
[1:37:41] no he said but our love is so strong
[1:37:44] that it's not spoken like that
[1:37:46] she knows that i love her so much that i
[1:37:49] wouldn't dare do anything to hurt her
[1:37:52] how about our relationship with the lord
[1:37:54] does he know that about you
[1:37:56] does he know that your relationship is
[1:37:58] so he's already proven his love he's
[1:38:00] already proven that he cares more for
[1:38:01] you than his own life
[1:38:03] what about you
[1:38:04] have you shared the same kind of love
[1:38:06] with your savior have you shared now
[1:38:08] this might just be simple preaching
[1:38:11] but have you shared that with him
[1:38:15] you love him so much you would rather
[1:38:17] die than hurt him
[1:38:18] i love this so much i'd rather i'd
[1:38:20] rather cease to breathe than hurt him
[1:38:24] where his where his victory
[1:38:28] you quoted it yesterday
[1:38:30] where is victory
[1:38:34] we're not we're not just the crown cast
[1:38:36] at his feet we're on the throne we're
[1:38:38] there with him we are his victory we're
[1:38:40] his bride we're we're we're but
[1:38:42] sometimes we don't realize how important
[1:38:44] we are in this in this realm
[1:38:47] my the devil's got us so beat up
[1:38:48] sometimes we just barely mope our way
[1:38:50] into church
[1:38:53] man
[1:38:56] remember brother brandon would cover it
[1:38:57] and then uh he'd say
[1:39:01] he'd say they just write about praying
[1:39:03] and fasting
[1:39:04] praying fast praying fast he said why do
[1:39:06] they just write about praying fast much
[1:39:08] like the the disciples of john
[1:39:12] remember the pharisees came to jesus and
[1:39:14] they said why do john's disciples fast
[1:39:16] and pray and we're fasting and praying
[1:39:18] but yet your disciples are eating and
[1:39:20] drinking with you
[1:39:23] my that makes me happy because i know
[1:39:24] what class i'm in i'm not sad i'm not
[1:39:27] worried i'm not moping my way in here
[1:39:29] but how could you be sad when the bride
[1:39:32] is dining with the bridegroom we're with
[1:39:35] him we're one we're fellowshipping with
[1:39:37] him where he he said they they write
[1:39:39] those things because they have not
[1:39:40] realized the awakening of the bride
[1:39:44] i've been awakened
[1:39:46] not a false woke out there this is the
[1:39:48] real awakening in this hour we have been
[1:39:50] awakened to realize that the word is
[1:39:52] becoming manifest in you
[1:39:56] many of you have been in here longer
[1:39:58] than i've been alive all of those years
[1:40:00] of teaching has come up to this moment
[1:40:02] in time that you could realize all of
[1:40:04] that foundation is coming to life in
[1:40:07] this hour all of that word that's been
[1:40:09] poured in and poured in and poured in is
[1:40:12] coming to life in this hour under this
[1:40:14] season you are walking in prophecy
[1:40:19] i don't know if there's monitors but if
[1:40:20] i could get a little bit you're walking
[1:40:23] in prophecy
[1:40:25] and that prophecy has a voice
[1:40:29] right
[1:40:30] she will be the final voice to the final
[1:40:32] age that prophecy has a voice
[1:40:37] he would say then take that bucket of
[1:40:38] water set it at a post out there and see
[1:40:40] if nature will run it down and in the
[1:40:42] fall of the year and bring it back in
[1:40:43] the spring no sir what is it now aside
[1:40:46] it's god's provided way
[1:40:49] it only operates the way god provides
[1:40:51] for it a little voice says get down to
[1:40:53] the roots and down it goes now it does
[1:40:56] that without any intelligence what what
[1:40:58] are we to do by the same god speaking to
[1:41:01] us
[1:41:02] we but we got a right to refuse it
[1:41:06] or to accept it
[1:41:07] and mostly we refuse it
[1:41:12] he says but a tree
[1:41:15] remember you agreed to enter in with me
[1:41:17] we're pretending to be trees for a
[1:41:18] minute
[1:41:19] but a tree
[1:41:21] can't refuse
[1:41:22] a tree only knows one routine and that's
[1:41:26] to obey its master it cannot refuse when
[1:41:29] the sun goes away the life drops into
[1:41:31] the roots to preserve it right now when
[1:41:34] the sun comes back that life must
[1:41:36] must come up out of those roots and
[1:41:38] bring forth fruit
[1:41:41] it's the hour that we're living in it's
[1:41:43] the time that we're in we're not gonna
[1:41:45] be don't don't be trouble that you're
[1:41:47] gonna run out of gas at the finish line
[1:41:49] god did not bring you all the way this
[1:41:51] far just to leave you there at the line
[1:41:52] brother he didn't bring you out of
[1:41:54] whatever you came out of just to leave
[1:41:55] you right here at this time he brought
[1:41:58] you to be a finisher he brought you to
[1:42:00] lay aside every weight that has so
[1:42:02] easily beset us and run the race that is
[1:42:04] set before us with the gospel
[1:42:07] [Music]
[1:42:08] this is why i believe what i believe i'm
[1:42:10] not interested in just hearing uh good
[1:42:12] thoughts or a good sermon i want life
[1:42:15] i want to see life
[1:42:18] it's what's inside of me
[1:42:20] i can't help but produce it i can't help
[1:42:22] it i'm a tree i can't refuse it i've got
[1:42:25] to produce a life i'm a living son of
[1:42:27] god
[1:42:28] my sometimes the devil would look at us
[1:42:30] and say living
[1:42:33] i'm a living son of god i produce the
[1:42:36] fruit of which i'm talking about i know
[1:42:38] what i'm talking about i know that this
[1:42:40] message works
[1:42:42] i know this message works when you have
[1:42:43] nobody else to lean on it when you don't
[1:42:45] know where else to go and when you're so
[1:42:46] confused in your mind i know this
[1:42:48] message works i know this message works
[1:42:51] when you're just a hypocrite sitting on
[1:42:52] the front pew saying amen just like
[1:42:54] everybody else i know this message works
[1:42:57] i know this message works when you're
[1:42:59] out drunk on the street and you don't
[1:43:00] know your own name i know this message
[1:43:03] works
[1:43:04] i know what i'm talking about
[1:43:06] this is life
[1:43:09] how would where would we be without it
[1:43:11] where would we be without the grace of
[1:43:13] god and to think sometimes we let him
[1:43:15] sit in the corner
[1:43:16] with dirty feet on because we're so
[1:43:18] concerned with some
[1:43:22] my goodness
[1:43:24] here a while back i was out uh uh at my
[1:43:27] my dad's uh uh dedication meetings
[1:43:30] or not dedication but what do you call
[1:43:31] that

[1:44:02] cutting hair and watching it like they
[1:44:05] didn't know who was going to win
[1:44:08] and they had the attention of everybody
[1:44:10] in the room because it's overtime
[1:44:12] there's less than two minutes left this
[1:44:13] is the final capstone of the game one
[1:44:16] way or the other the game's over and

[1:44:44] jumping off roofs and they're they're
[1:44:45] shouting and they're doing backflips and
[1:44:48] it's about a rubber ball
[1:44:50] that maybe will go into that hoop
[1:44:52] and they're cheering on some guy who
[1:44:53] sold his soul for 120 million dollars to
[1:44:57] throw a rubber ball inside a hoop but
[1:44:59] yet the the living god will come into
[1:45:02] our midst and he will perform signs and
[1:45:05] wonders and miracles and change hearts
[1:45:07] and lives and he'll barely get up
[1:45:11] barely get a hand raise god forbid that
[1:45:13] we would leave him in the corner with
[1:45:15] dirty feet

[1:46:26] messiah is amongst us he's walking
[1:46:28] amongst us remember
[1:46:30] we're not azusa street

[1:46:53] to deliver and you won't let me in
[1:46:55] he's not only knocking on the church

[1:46:58] heart i'm coming to deliver why won't
[1:47:01] you let me in there's only one way
[1:47:04] you're going to get back to life is to
[1:47:05] let me in there is to let me in and i'll
[1:47:08] eradicate sin i'll eradicate the devil
[1:47:11] i'll remove any condemnation i'll remove
[1:47:13] any regret just let me in
[1:47:16] let me in
[1:47:17] that's why i get so excited about this
[1:47:19] it's passion
[1:47:20] it's my life
[1:47:22] cause i know where i was
[1:47:24] when i let him in
[1:47:26] i know what kind of condition i was in
[1:47:28] when i decided to let him in
[1:47:33] you know brother branham said that
[1:47:34] you'll not change the way you praise
[1:47:36] the way that you worship him here
[1:47:39] is exactly how you worship him over
[1:47:41] there
[1:47:43] so if you're waiting for some glorious
[1:47:45] angel to come and you see him coming
[1:47:48] down you're not going to change the way
[1:47:50] that you praise
[1:47:51] you're not going to change the way you
[1:47:52] praise when you recognize him coming in
[1:47:54] his his corporal body you're not going
[1:47:56] to change the way you praise when we're
[1:47:57] on the other side and we're saying we're
[1:47:59] resting on that you're going to praise
[1:48:01] exactly like you praise him now
[1:48:04] [Applause]
[1:48:05] for some of us we just got to realize
[1:48:07] we've got the praise we've got the
[1:48:09] worship within us i was down here with
[1:48:11] these young people last night they got
[1:48:12] the praise within them sometimes we just
[1:48:14] got to let it out sometimes just gotta
[1:48:16] let out the praise and say i'll glorify
[1:48:18] the lord
[1:48:20] let every breath that i have be used to
[1:48:22] glorify the lord
[1:48:26] i can send you quotes to back all this
[1:48:27] up if you want it later but how dare a
[1:48:29] cavalier fan
[1:48:32] praise louder than me
[1:48:36] how dare i be more concerned with what's
[1:48:38] going on in this temporal world than
[1:48:40] concerned with what's going on right
[1:48:41] here
[1:48:42] while he's on the scene
[1:48:44] right here what are we what are we
[1:48:45] clemson fans in here
[1:48:48] bulldogs
[1:48:50] how dare we be more concerned
[1:48:56] up in ohio it's the buckeyes in the in
[1:48:58] the wolverines right the big rivalry
[1:49:00] when they're playing together a whole
[1:49:02] town shuts down
[1:49:04] you can't get somebody to come to church
[1:49:06] what is it the god of the civil age has
[1:49:08] taken the attention off of the of the
[1:49:10] word and he's put the eyes on something
[1:49:12] else i say there's only one way back to
[1:49:15] life you can have that life or you can
[1:49:17] have this life i choose this life i
[1:49:20] choose life eternal to know where i'm
[1:49:22] going
[1:49:23] it's more than ink on a page to me it's
[1:49:26] life and life abundantly
[1:49:29] that's what we've been promised in this
[1:49:30] hour
[1:49:31] god don't need my reasoning about it
[1:49:34] you don't need my think
[1:49:35] i don't have a thing coming
[1:49:37] god wants the word the word only he
[1:49:40] wants people who will take the word just
[1:49:42] as it's preached and manifest it just as
[1:49:45] it was spoken i say it's us
[1:49:48] is anybody with me to say it's me i want
[1:49:50] to manifest this word with everything
[1:49:52] that's within me let me become a living
[1:49:54] reality of this message
[1:49:56] let somebody don't have to ask where the
[1:49:58] revival's at they'll see me and say
[1:50:00] there's the revival
[1:50:02] there it is it's happening in the church
[1:50:06] but the pharisees were so concerned with
[1:50:08] how it was done they missed the coming
[1:50:11] of it they missed the come they were
[1:50:13] looking for it brother bob they were
[1:50:14] looking for him to come
[1:50:16] their whole thing they were studying
[1:50:17] over the scrolls they knew him front to
[1:50:19] back they could quote you every word of
[1:50:21] isaiah
[1:50:22] but they missed him even when he came
[1:50:24] and identified himself in front of them
[1:50:26] and he comes down off the mountain and
[1:50:27] he opens the scroll and he turns the
[1:50:29] book of isaiah they knew it like the
[1:50:30] back of their hand
[1:50:32] but he's showing this day
[1:50:35] this scripture is fulfilled in your ears
[1:50:38] i say we have the same word of prophecy
[1:50:40] in this day this day is this scripture
[1:50:43] fulfilled in your ears he's showing us
[1:50:45] the time that we're living in is a
[1:50:47] rapture time
[1:50:49] don't hold back and wait for some other
[1:50:51] age this is the last stage don't wait
[1:50:54] for another revival to come through this
[1:50:56] is the bride's revival
[1:50:58] the move is on for the bride
[1:51:00] we are walking in the last move we are
[1:51:03] living in the last wave of god he's
[1:51:05] saving maybe for the last time
[1:51:09] don't be guilty of missing it because
[1:51:10] you can't get out of some tradition or
[1:51:12] can't get off your
[1:51:14] high horse
[1:51:16] paul was knocked off his high horse
[1:51:19] we can't dwell on an old experience
[1:51:21] we can't dwell on something that
[1:51:23] happened to us all in the night he saved
[1:51:24] me 30 years ago praise the lord
[1:51:27] where is he today
[1:51:29] i was driving down the road down here
[1:51:31] and the lord just gave me a phrase and i
[1:51:32] wrote it down i didn't know why he said
[1:51:34] when's the last time
[1:51:37] and i started thinking about i said
[1:51:39] when's the last time i just had a good
[1:51:40] old holy ghost shouting fit
[1:51:42] when's the last time i let the holy
[1:51:44] ghost come down and just ignite my soul
[1:51:46] my sometimes i think we we forget what
[1:51:48] it's like to have joy in our soul we
[1:51:51] forget what it's like to be free we
[1:51:52] forget what it's like just to worship
[1:51:54] the lord not caring about what anybody
[1:51:56] thinks not caring about what your wife
[1:51:58] might think or your husband might think
[1:51:59] when's the last time you let the lord
[1:52:01] have his way in your life
[1:52:04] when's the last time you let him
[1:52:06] activate that life within you it's
[1:52:08] laying in there
[1:52:10] when's the last time you let it happen
[1:52:11] but those promises are laying in the
[1:52:14] church
[1:52:15] in the roots
[1:52:17] and at the appointed time he'll bring
[1:52:19] him forth
[1:52:22] what time
[1:52:26] in my day of visitation
[1:52:29] we're here
[1:52:30] this day
[1:52:32] this scripture is fulfilled
[1:52:34] in your ears
[1:52:36] i like that it didn't say in brother
[1:52:38] branham's ears or justin branham
[1:52:39] tabernacle or the pentecostage ears but
[1:52:42] this day this scripture is fulfilled in
[1:52:45] your ears somebody will take this word
[1:52:48] and will manifest it in their life it's
[1:52:50] going to be me somebody will take this
[1:52:53] prophet's prophecy and fulfill it it's
[1:52:56] going to be me somebody will walk in
[1:52:58] this prophecy all the way to a body
[1:53:00] change it's going to be me
[1:53:03] where's your faith this morning to say i
[1:53:05] fulfill that word this day this
[1:53:07] scripture is fulfilled in my ears it's
[1:53:10] my season for it i've been appointed for
[1:53:12] it
[1:53:13] there's only one way i'm going to get
[1:53:15] there
[1:53:18] everybody so tore up about the vaccines
[1:53:20] and shots in this age let me say i'm not
[1:53:23] for or against it but there's only one
[1:53:25] shot that you absolutely
[1:53:27] absolutely must have and that is the
[1:53:30] spirit of truth without that shot you
[1:53:33] will not even see what i'm talking about
[1:53:35] the teaching that you hear the preaching
[1:53:37] that you hear the the conviction that
[1:53:39] you feel you will not understand it
[1:53:41] unless you have that shot
[1:53:44] we'll not get it without the holy ghost
[1:53:46] that's why the devil's trying so hard to
[1:53:48] keep it out of the pulpit that's why the
[1:53:49] devil's trying to say we can't preach
[1:53:51] that we can't preach that they'll think
[1:53:52] you're fanatic well you're going to be a
[1:53:54] fanatic for somebody
[1:53:56] i'd much rather be guilty of being a
[1:53:57] fanatic for the holy ghost being a
[1:53:59] fanatic to know that once i was lost in
[1:54:02] sin all but jesus set me free what's
[1:54:05] satan have you bound but jesus set me
[1:54:07] free
[1:54:11] how could we cease but to praise him
[1:54:13] all of our life is doing
[1:54:16] my
[1:54:17] every breath that we have should be used
[1:54:18] to praise him
[1:54:20] but we spent more of our breath
[1:54:22] talking about how bad our circumstance
[1:54:24] is
[1:54:25] oh what was me
[1:54:28] remember brother julie you said wowzy
[1:54:30] wowzy woof
[1:54:36] let your testimony be negative
[1:54:39] always positive that's a direct quote
[1:54:42] not mind over matter not psychology not
[1:54:46] choo choo train mentality i think i can
[1:54:48] i think i can but to know no matter
[1:54:50] what's going on
[1:54:52] in this in this season this dimension
[1:54:54] down here there's another me out there
[1:54:57] that's rejoicing that's praising that
[1:55:00] shouting
[1:55:02] to think that i already have an earnest
[1:55:04] of it don't let your heart be troubled
[1:55:07] neither be afraid
[1:55:09] that rapturing faith that you're
[1:55:10] wondering right now if you possess it
[1:55:12] brother man said don't worry it'll be
[1:55:14] there
[1:55:15] it'll be there he says it twice don't
[1:55:17] worry it'll be there it'll be there
[1:55:20] don't worry about it neither let your
[1:55:21] heart be troubled it's already in you
[1:55:24] predestinated resources
[1:55:27] to overcome in this hour predestinated
[1:55:30] fake to overcome in this hour at the
[1:55:32] right season it comes out of the tree
[1:55:34] and where does the fruit ripen last at
[1:55:37] the top of the tree when the sun is just
[1:55:40] over the top
[1:55:42] a capstone
[1:55:45] now we know where we're at
[1:55:47] this day
[1:55:48] this scripture
[1:55:50] is fulfilled in your ears but you can't
[1:55:53] get there you will not produce that
[1:55:55] fruit unless the same life
[1:55:57] is laying within you
[1:55:58] i believe it's in there but it's got to
[1:56:00] be activated right but the man would
[1:56:02] talk about that gene seed laying in the
[1:56:04] church waiting to be activated there's
[1:56:06] only one way
[1:56:08] back to life it's not from a coveted
[1:56:10] shot it's not from a yellow fever shot
[1:56:13] it's from a holy ghost booster shot
[1:56:17] if you don't have it get the initial
[1:56:19] shot if you already have it get a
[1:56:21] booster those are exact quotes you can
[1:56:23] go back and research it get a booster of
[1:56:25] the holy ghost
[1:56:27] there's only one way back to life amen
[1:56:30] and it's through the holy ghost
[1:56:32] it's through his spirit of truth it's
[1:56:34] through him
[1:56:36] dividing it unto us giving it unto us
[1:56:39] ministering unto us this is your portion
[1:56:41] here's your inheritance here's your
[1:56:43] inheritance but the ramp said joshua
[1:56:45] represented that still small voice
[1:56:47] inside you which is the holy ghost
[1:56:49] here's your inheritance here's your
[1:56:51] inheritance here's yours yours you want
[1:56:53] your kids
[1:56:54] you want health here's yours you want
[1:56:56] salvation for your loved ones here's
[1:56:58] yours
[1:56:59] you want you want to know him and
[1:57:00] experience him in power here's yours
[1:57:03] here's your inheritance you want to have
[1:57:05] joy here's your inheritance you want to
[1:57:07] know what it's like just to feel and
[1:57:09] brush by here's your inheritance
[1:57:11] he's passing out his inheritance it's
[1:57:13] the holy ghost
[1:57:18] we've all got something to overcome no
[1:57:20] matter how holy you think you are
[1:57:22] no matter how close to it you live you
[1:57:24] were born under the same nature that
[1:57:26] everybody else was born under but there
[1:57:28] comes a time when that nature must be
[1:57:31] defeated
[1:57:33] we're living in that hour
[1:57:34] we're living in that time it only comes
[1:57:36] one way
[1:57:38] one way back to life
[1:57:40] you know i was driving down the road
[1:57:41] some months ago
[1:57:42] and just uh just kind of how the lord
[1:57:44] works with me i'll just be driving
[1:57:45] sometimes not even thinking on something
[1:57:46] that just a line will drop in
[1:57:49] and it'll turn into a 20-page sermon you
[1:57:51] might think well you're not doing a very
[1:57:52] good job but that's just the way the
[1:57:54] lord built me
[1:57:58] so i i got i got an inspiration to look
[1:58:00] up anti-venom
[1:58:01] anybody you know here ain't here know
[1:58:03] how anti-venom's made
[1:58:04] i knew a little bit about it but i
[1:58:06] really didn't know about it so i just
[1:58:07] google it sorry
[1:58:11] i just google it
[1:58:14] an antivenom is made
[1:58:16] by them injecting a
[1:58:19] snake whether it be let's just say it's
[1:58:20] a rattlesnake what kind of snakes do we
[1:58:21] have down here
[1:58:22] rattlesnakes
[1:58:24] let's just say it's a rattlesnake
[1:58:25] antavinifer rattlesnake is made by them
[1:58:27] injecting that snake's venom into an
[1:58:30] animal
[1:58:30] and then that animal absorbs that venom
[1:58:33] into its bloodstream and the
[1:58:35] intelligence that's already in that
[1:58:37] animal begins to create an antibody and
[1:58:40] those antibodies begin to attack that
[1:58:42] venom and attack that venom until it
[1:58:45] becomes a cure against that venom
[1:58:49] something already in the animal
[1:58:50] has been put there
[1:58:52] to fight off the venom we say well what
[1:58:55] does that have to do with us we were
[1:58:57] born under a serpent nature all injected
[1:59:00] with the same venom but until we get the
[1:59:03] antivenom that venom is circulating
[1:59:05] through our blood but there was once a
[1:59:07] sacrifice
[1:59:09] that took that venom within itself
[1:59:11] you know how they get that antivenom out
[1:59:13] of that animal those antibodies they cut
[1:59:15] that animal and they bleed it out and
[1:59:17] those antibodies come out through that
[1:59:19] blood when they they force it out and
[1:59:22] that's what you get injected when you
[1:59:23] get antivenom shot
[1:59:26] but 2 000 years ago
[1:59:28] there was a shot given
[1:59:30] there was a venom injected into a
[1:59:32] sacrifice and that sacrifice was pierced
[1:59:35] by a roman soldier and they began to
[1:59:37] bleed him out and as he bled out my
[1:59:39] antivenom was in that holy ghost my
[1:59:42] antivirus was in that spirit that poured
[1:59:45] out and without it you will always walk
[1:59:48] in partial victory
[1:59:51] how many years ready for a full victory
[1:59:54] how many is here tired of the devil
[1:59:55] telling you what you can and cannot do
[1:59:59] how many how many's tired of the devil
[2:00:00] beating you up
[2:00:02] telling you that you're only going to
[2:00:03] make it this far
[2:00:05] i've taken the shot
[2:00:09] i took the
[2:00:10] antibodies i know you're already
[2:00:13] defeated i know the same antibodies that
[2:00:15] took your keys as living inside me he
[2:00:18] that is in you is greater than he that
[2:00:21] is in the world he the spirit of truth
[2:00:23] is laying in you
[2:00:25] waiting for you to recognize and
[2:00:26] activate him
[2:00:28] how many times have we let the devil
[2:00:29] come by and step on us
[2:00:32] take from us
[2:00:33] rob from us
[2:00:35] wake up on the wrong side of the bed and
[2:00:36] there goes our joy
[2:00:38] the wife says something to us there goes
[2:00:40] our joy
[2:00:41] bill comes in there goes our joy
[2:00:43] how many times the devil come in and
[2:00:45] taking your joy from you
[2:00:48] we talked about it yesterday with the
[2:00:49] kids
[2:00:51] i went to the enemy's camp and i
[2:00:54] took back what he stole from me
[2:00:57] whose joy was it to begin with yours
[2:01:00] whose victory was it to begin with yours
[2:01:03] you are his victory it was yours to
[2:01:06] begin with
[2:01:07] my goodness to think that we've let the
[2:01:09] devil come in and rob us and rob us when
[2:01:12] we have kingdom authority
[2:01:14] when we have a more sure word of
[2:01:16] prophecy to think that we can
[2:01:18] every giant should fall before us every
[2:01:21] sickness would fall before us i just
[2:01:22] heard the prophet say he said if we
[2:01:24] could ever get the church to believe
[2:01:26] this in fullness and to be in one mind
[2:01:28] and one accord there wouldn't be one
[2:01:30] sick person among us
[2:01:35] it's time for self-examination

[2:02:08] amongst us if we believe this word in
[2:02:11] fullness then receive of all of its
[2:02:13] benefits

[2:02:50] of water he that takes god's laws and
[2:02:52] love in his heart he shall be like a

[2:03:16] bear the fruit of the word that's been
[2:03:18] planted in there that's my identity it's
[2:03:20] not this flesh you see out here there's
[2:03:22] another me in there that you can't see
[2:03:24] and his season is here
[2:03:27] his fruit is here
[2:03:28] his time is here the bride's already
[2:03:30] restored we're not waiting for it to
[2:03:32] come
[2:03:34] we're not waiting the loose ends have
[2:03:35] already been tied together friends
[2:03:37] if you're waiting for some more loose
[2:03:39] ends to come every vision has already
[2:03:41] been fulfilled
[2:03:44] hope we're in agreement on that
[2:03:46] it's already been fulfilled we're
[2:03:48] waiting for him to come back
[2:03:50] we're waiting for this ministry to ride
[2:03:52] this trail again and i believe it's
[2:03:54] doing it now
[2:03:55] through a quick short work the miracles
[2:03:58] of god are coming to pass we're
[2:04:00] witnessing just a few weeks ago i was in
[2:04:02] mexico and there was a uh just a
[2:04:04] supernatural event that took place in
[2:04:05] the way it happened and there was an
[2:04:07] impromptu prayer line that came through
[2:04:08] and in that prayer line i saw hernias
[2:04:10] retracted i saw thyroid gorters just
[2:04:13] retracted the symptoms gone
[2:04:15] prodigals run in the back door and run
[2:04:17] and give their hearts back to the lord
[2:04:19] what is it it's a season for it it's the
[2:04:22] season for the bride's manifestation
[2:04:25] i'm not waiting for it it's already here
[2:04:28] not waiting all when i can get myself
[2:04:29] there it's already here don't miss your
[2:04:33] hour of visitation it's already amongst
[2:04:35] us
[2:04:37] recognize who you are he's not coming
[2:04:38] back for a broke body not coming back
[2:04:41] for a freak bride but somebody who knows
[2:04:43] where they stand
[2:04:47] i may be weak in my flesh
[2:04:49] but i know where my faith is
[2:04:51] i may be weak in my mind but i know
[2:04:54] where my faith lies
[2:04:56] it's more than just a hope
[2:04:59] it's a surety
[2:05:00] i'm anchored
[2:05:02] in that rock
[2:05:03] we've got to be so sure this is not a
[2:05:05] time to question
[2:05:07] i'm a closer
[2:05:08] this is not a time to question
[2:05:11] what you believe in
[2:05:14] not a time to wonder if this is really
[2:05:15] the truth
[2:05:16] a time to back up and say i'm not well
[2:05:18] i'm just not sure this is not a time for
[2:05:21] that
[2:05:22] this is the finish line
[2:05:24] this is the hour
[2:05:25] of his visitation
[2:05:27] this is the time when he's coming and
[2:05:29] say will i find faith
[2:05:31] when i come
[2:05:33] this is not the time to back up on what
[2:05:34] you believe
[2:05:36] he didn't bring you this far to leave
[2:05:37] you where you're at now this is not the
[2:05:39] time to retreat but we must have the
[2:05:41] faith of gideon although we're weary
[2:05:44] although we want to just lay down and
[2:05:45] let somebody else do it we can't because
[2:05:47] there's something within us that says
[2:05:49] pursue
[2:05:50] pursue
[2:05:52] go after him go after him pursue the
[2:05:55] enemy pursue him out of your home pursue
[2:05:58] him out of your marriage pursue him out
[2:05:59] of your kid's relationship pursue him
[2:06:01] out of your mind battles pursue him out
[2:06:03] of your addictions pursue him out of
[2:06:05] your faults
[2:06:06] pursue
[2:06:07] this is the hour for it he's given us
[2:06:10] the strength within us
[2:06:12] my i think it's it's mighty that we are
[2:06:14] given the hour of when she'll speak
[2:06:18] and if she speaks
[2:06:19] she's got to have breath within her
[2:06:22] where did that life come from
[2:06:24] breath
[2:06:26] all life comes from god
[2:06:27] he's the breath
[2:06:29] you know i saw something uh i was at uh
[2:06:32] uh brother ron's in the back office
[2:06:34] there a few months ago and he shared
[2:06:36] with me this video clip that this this
[2:06:39] lady was describing and when moses
[2:06:41] thought to ask god what his name was
[2:06:45] he answered you know we added the yahweh
[2:06:47] in there
[2:06:48] but the original hebrew translation is
[2:06:51] yw
[2:06:52] hw
[2:06:53] and so this linguistic lady broke it
[2:06:55] down she said it wasn't really a word it
[2:06:58] was an action
[2:06:59] it was a verb
[2:07:01] when moses thought to ask what the name
[2:07:03] of elohim was
[2:07:05] he answered with an action
[2:07:08] he she said that linguistics said that
[2:07:10] it would be the exact letters that moses
[2:07:13] would pin
[2:07:14] to pin the action of breathing
[2:07:26] to think
[2:07:28] that life itself
[2:07:30] testifies
[2:07:32] that there's a god
[2:07:34] testifies every baby that's born in this
[2:07:36] world the first thing it does is testify
[2:07:38] of god every person that goes out of
[2:07:41] this world the last thing they do is
[2:07:43] testify of god he's the breath in our
[2:07:46] lungs he's the reason we sing he's the
[2:07:48] reason we praise let everything that
[2:07:50] hath breath praise ye the lord
[2:07:54] how dare we use our breath for any other
[2:07:56] purpose and but to praise the lord he is
[2:07:58] the life behind us that's what gives us
[2:08:01] a voice authority in this age is the
[2:08:03] breath of elohim it's in our lungs it's
[2:08:06] in our body it's in this word it's
[2:08:08] coming forth the action of breathing is
[2:08:11] here
[2:08:13] why just take a breath
[2:08:15] there he is
[2:08:17] there he is
[2:08:18] i don't know about you when the holy
[2:08:19] ghost comes by me i just i feel that
[2:08:21] something's different in my lungs
[2:08:23] oh he's here
[2:08:24] i can feel him in the air i can feel a
[2:08:26] change in the atmosphere i can feel
[2:08:28] something's different i'm breathing in
[2:08:30] life
[2:08:34] he came to the prophet with the same
[2:08:36] temptation he's laying before you
[2:08:39] look at this you spent your life serving
[2:08:41] him he's taking your wife
[2:08:44] he's taking your baby
[2:08:45] you've got nothing
[2:08:47] yeah you're right
[2:08:52] all those hours you spent preaching to
[2:08:54] those people
[2:08:55] all those hours laboring
[2:08:57] doesn't even mean anything
[2:08:59] yeah maybe you're right
[2:09:03] you know he
[2:09:05] he maybe he didn't never heal nobody
[2:09:07] maybe you just make believe that
[2:09:10] yeah maybe
[2:09:12] don't tell me that our prophet wasn't
[2:09:13] honest with us
[2:09:15] about the struggles that he went through
[2:09:18] it's the same temptation
[2:09:22] yeah maybe you're just going to church
[2:09:23] because it makes you feel good and maybe
[2:09:24] there's no truth to this
[2:09:27] yeah
[2:09:29] maybe
[2:09:31] you know what
[2:09:33] there's not even a god
[2:09:43] no you've gone too far devil you've gone
[2:09:46] too far i feel him in my lungs
[2:09:49] i feel the life within me i feel that
[2:09:51] there's something inside me that that
[2:09:52] you didn't give to me that you didn't
[2:09:54] produce there's a greater life within me
[2:09:57] i'm breathing his life he is live he's
[2:10:00] breath he's he's everything that i am
[2:10:02] and if you lied to me about that you
[2:10:03] lied to me about it he is a healer he is
[2:10:06] a savior he is a redeemer he is a
[2:10:09] restorer he is a liberator he is our
[2:10:12] release he is our joy he is our freedom
[2:10:16] if you lied to me about that that you
[2:10:18] lied about everything else he's the
[2:10:20] breath sometimes we just got to stop and
[2:10:22] take a breath
[2:10:23] it's god
[2:10:25] there's a god in the room he can change
[2:10:27] every you're here somebody pat yourself
[2:10:29] and say i'm still here
[2:10:32] i'm right here devil you haven't got me
[2:10:34] yet i can change the circumstance that
[2:10:37] i'm living in there's breath in my lung
[2:10:40] it's the action of living and the hand
[2:10:43] of the lord was upon me and carried me
[2:10:45] out in the spirit of the lord and set me
[2:10:47] down in the midst of the valley which
[2:10:48] was full of bones and caused me to pass
[2:10:51] by then ran about and behold there were
[2:10:53] very very many open in the valley and lo
[2:10:55] they were very dry and he said unto me
[2:10:58] son of man
[2:11:00] can these bones live and i answered oh
[2:11:03] lord god thou knowest again he said unto
[2:11:05] me prophesy unto these bones and say
[2:11:08] unto them oh ye dry bones hear the word
[2:11:11] of the lord
[2:11:13] thus saith the lord god unto these bones
[2:11:15] behold i will cause breath to enter into
[2:11:18] you and ye
[2:11:20] shall live
[2:11:23] that's our prophecy in this hour
[2:11:26] he will cause breath to enter into you
[2:11:28] and you will live eternally
[2:11:32] his breath does not have an expiration
[2:11:34] date on it
[2:11:35] his breath is alive
[2:11:37] it's moving in the bride it's speaking
[2:11:40] it's prophesying it's it's it's
[2:11:42] fulfilling
[2:11:45] the word of this hour
[2:11:47] okay can i have a little liberty
[2:11:49] the group that sing that song would you
[2:11:51] all come back up and sing it just now
[2:11:53] is that okay
[2:11:55] let's just sing that song when i heard
[2:11:56] that song strike i i knew why the lord
[2:11:59] had me turn this direction
[2:12:02] you may feel that you're a dry bone but
[2:12:04] that's not the end of your story he said
[2:12:07] i say unto you that i will cause breath
[2:12:10] to enter into you and ye
[2:12:13] shall live
[2:12:15] that's thus
[2:12:17] saith the lord
[2:12:19] what more sure word do you want
[2:12:22] what more sure where do you need
[2:12:24] it doesn't get any better than that
[2:12:26] the president united states would come
[2:12:28] in here and say hey you're going to be
[2:12:29] all right don't mean a thing the
[2:12:31] greatest doctor in the world could say
[2:12:32] we'll preserve you for years and years
[2:12:34] to come don't mean a thing but you have
[2:12:37] thus
[2:12:38] saith the lord
[2:12:41] his breath
[2:12:42] is already in you
[2:12:46] my friends
[2:12:48] to think
[2:12:50] god almighty
[2:12:53] thought so much of you
[2:12:55] without so much of me
[2:12:59] how could we let him sit in the corner
[2:13:00] with dirty feet
[2:13:05] let me just finish this point while you
[2:13:07] guys get ready
[2:13:08] that woman
[2:13:10] that came into that simon's house
[2:13:12] was bearing the same condemnation that
[2:13:14] we all bear
[2:13:15] feeling unworthy feeling unwanted
[2:13:17] feeling that there was no way for us
[2:13:19] feeling that we'd send away our day of
[2:13:20] grace feeling that somehow we're just
[2:13:23] gonna miss it all together and it's just
[2:13:24] gonna come right by us
[2:13:26] but she couldn't just sit back
[2:13:28] and let it happen without her making her
[2:13:30] best effort
[2:13:32] and there she comes that house just put
[2:13:33] yourself in her shoes it's not hard for
[2:13:35] us to do because we're there
[2:13:38] and she's walking in that house of simon
[2:13:40] dragging her weight
[2:13:42] there he is across the room oh my how it
[2:13:45] hurt her
[2:13:46] to see he was just there with dirty feet
[2:13:48] i can't believe they're not washing his
[2:13:50] feet
[2:13:53] i can't believe they're not worshiping
[2:13:55] him
[2:13:57] the king of kings has come down
[2:13:59] and they're letting him sit there with
[2:14:01] dirty feet
[2:14:04] i must go on
[2:14:06] she drags her
[2:14:08] condemnation
[2:14:09] and then she gets closer to that
[2:14:11] anointed one that chain begins to fall
[2:14:14] the chain begins to fall
[2:14:16] as she approaches him all she can do is
[2:14:18] just fall at his feet
[2:14:25] she didn't hold anything back for the
[2:14:26] next race
[2:14:27] that was her race she didn't hold
[2:14:30] anything back to say i'm just going to
[2:14:31] reserve a little bit but she poured all
[2:14:33] that she had out on his feet
[2:14:37] and sometimes we feel so unworthy to
[2:14:39] even wash his feet we feel so unworthy
[2:14:42] to entertain the presence of an angel we
[2:14:44] think who are we
[2:14:46] but you know god knew that that was
[2:14:47] going to happen
[2:14:48] and the prophet said that he
[2:14:50] predestinated her with everything that
[2:14:53] she had need of to worship him
[2:14:57] he said she had me to do him a service
[2:14:59] it was within her heart to do him a
[2:15:01] service but she had nothing to do it
[2:15:03] with
[2:15:04] so god provided the towels
[2:15:12] he provided the towels
[2:15:14] and the water
[2:15:18] go ahead and take a breath
[2:15:23] who provided that
[2:15:27] oh friends this might be simple to you
[2:15:30] but god forbid
[2:15:31] we let him sit in the corner
[2:15:36] promised to be here
[2:15:38] so if he's here
[2:15:40] it's your duty
[2:15:43] it's your desire
[2:15:45] it's your passion
[2:15:46] it's your life
[2:15:48] to worship
[2:15:50] don't hold back a little bit of oil
[2:15:52] this might be the last mile of the race
[2:15:55] don't hold back just a little bit of
[2:15:56] praise this might be everything this
[2:15:58] might be it
[2:15:59] this praise that you let out this
[2:16:01] morning might be your prodigal coming
[2:16:03] back in the door i've seen it happen too
[2:16:05] many times i could give testimony after
[2:16:07] testimony of it this final breath might
[2:16:09] be the one
[2:16:11] don't let it go by
[2:16:13] stay under that anointing while it's
[2:16:14] here

[2:50:52] how many other ministers have we've seen
[2:50:54] that
[2:50:55] that are calling out for
[2:50:57] for their children that are wayward
[2:50:59] their
[2:51:00] husbands and their wives
[2:51:02] it's time to get in the ark
[2:51:06] we've had 60 years since the prophet's
[2:51:09] been gone
[2:51:10] and he said the rapture was overdue
[2:51:13] in the 60s
[2:51:15] here we are in 2022 almost 20 23.
[2:51:20] it's about time for us to get in the ark
[2:51:23] because the door's gonna shut and when
[2:51:24] it does it doesn't matter what your
[2:51:26] mama's name is your daddy's name is it
[2:51:28] doesn't matter
[2:51:29] it does matter who your daddy's name is
[2:51:32] yes
[2:51:33] if your daddy's named the lord jesus
[2:51:35] you're going to be on that
[2:51:37] like i said before this is not a cruise
[2:51:39] ship we own we own a battleship
[2:51:41] hey man this is not this is not just
[2:51:43] easy but guess what
[2:51:45] what did moses do moses the bible says
[2:51:48] traded
[2:51:51] the wealth of the world and he could
[2:51:52] have been in egypt had all the women he
[2:51:54] wanted had all the graves he could have
[2:51:56] been fanned for the rest of his life and
[2:51:58] never had to do a thing but the bible
[2:52:00] says he forsook that
[2:52:02] right right
[2:52:04] yep he forsook that
[2:52:07] to become a mud dauber
[2:52:09] he forsooked that to lead a group of
[2:52:11] rebels
[2:52:13] that gave him heartburn for 40 years
[2:52:15] right hello somebody
[2:52:17] gave him heartburn for 40 years
[2:52:19] murmuring complained but he said
[2:52:22] we have a promise
[2:52:24] we're going across god gave me a
[2:52:25] commission to get you guys out now we're
[2:52:27] going to get you in the promised land we
[2:52:29] thank god for a commission that he's
[2:52:30] given us
[2:52:31] hey brother ronnie said we're going to
[2:52:33] the promised land somebody's going to
[2:52:35] make it we're the one who's going to
[2:52:36] make it hey man you just got to believe

[2:53:07] next weekend so we've got a few things
[2:53:09] still going on but but i like to see a
[2:53:11] church
[2:53:12] on the move
[2:53:14] doing things for the youth doing things
[2:53:16] for everybody everybody pitching in and
[2:53:18] doing what they need to do and
[2:53:20] and
[2:53:21] and if you're uncomfortable today then
[2:53:25] the lord help you
[2:53:27] if you're uncomfortable
[2:53:29] it's because of the devil it ain't ain't
[2:53:31] because of god
[2:53:32] it's because the devil that you're
[2:53:34] uncomfortable i want him to be
[2:53:36] uncomfortable i think he got so nervous
[2:53:38] at the first of this service that he
[2:53:40] left the building
[2:53:41] amen
[2:53:42] when the spirit of god came down during
[2:53:44] the song service and then he can't stand
[2:53:47] the word
[2:53:49] he can take he can hang around a little
[2:53:50] bit with a little bit of shouting and
[2:53:52] praising he's used to that
[2:53:54] but he ain't used to the word coming
[2:53:56] word by word
[2:53:57] he used to he ain't used to it coming
[2:53:59] through human flesh though but that's
[2:54:00] what god said he was gonna do he was
[2:54:02] gonna defeat the devil through me and
[2:54:04] you
[2:54:06] that's why we're his victory that's
[2:54:07] right
[2:54:09] that's why he put so much into us
[2:54:12] he put so much listen he had faith
[2:54:15] didn't brother brown say he had faith
[2:54:16] brother brown said jesus had faith in
[2:54:18] who he was
[2:54:19] god had faith and when he said let there
[2:54:20] be it was going to happen
[2:54:22] so now we got a little part of that
[2:54:23] inside of us called the holy ghost to
[2:54:26] give us that faith that we've been
[2:54:28] talking about so god bless you we love
[2:54:29] you with the love of the lord
[2:54:31] let's buy our heads we're going if you
[2:54:32] want to fellowship downstairs that's
[2:54:34] fine
[2:54:35] if you want to go get something to eat
[2:54:36] that's fine we're going to probably hang
[2:54:38] around a little bit and we'll probably
