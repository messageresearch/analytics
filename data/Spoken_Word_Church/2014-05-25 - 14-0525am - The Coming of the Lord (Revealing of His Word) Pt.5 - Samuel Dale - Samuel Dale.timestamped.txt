[10:45] and that thought is
[10:47] lord to get to be what we want to get
[10:50] across to the people
[10:51] and then we can move on in you we love
[10:53] you and we thank you
[10:55] in jesus name amen
[10:59] all right maybe an odd scripture to use
[11:02] on what we're talking about
[11:04] but the lord willing you'll see at the
[11:07] end what we're talking about
[11:10] first corinthians 15 23.
[11:13] you know it's coming down for the christ
[11:15] is risen to become the first fruits and
[11:16] then talks about
[11:18] adam and adam all die even so when
[11:20] christ can all be made alive
[11:22] but every man in his own order christ
[11:24] the first fruits
[11:25] afterward they that are christ at his
[11:27] coming then come at the end
[11:30] when he shall have delivered up the
[11:32] kingdom to god
[11:34] even the father when he shall have put
[11:36] down all rule
[11:37] and all authority and power for he must
[11:41] reign till he has put all
[11:43] enemies under his feet the last enemy
[11:46] that shall be destroyed is death
[11:49] for he has put all things under his feet
[11:52] amen but when he saith all things are
[11:55] put
[11:55] under him it is manifest
[11:58] manifest that he is accepted which
[12:01] did put all things under him and when
[12:05] all things shall be subdued unto him
[12:08] then shall the son also himself be
[12:10] subject unto him
[12:11] that put all things under him that god
[12:15] may be what all in
[12:18] all you may be seated lord add his
[12:20] blessing
[12:21] to the reading of the word
[12:24] now we've been
[12:28] trying to come down and lord willing if
[12:30] we can we'll try to have questions
[12:31] and answers this afternoon because maybe
[12:34] by the time we get through with a little
[12:36] comments and a few things i may create a
[12:39] lot of questions
[12:41] you know but that's what we want to do
[12:45] the prophet said questions makes a
[12:47] strong church
[12:48] all right now my way of saying that is
[12:51] i believe he was meaning that if we have
[12:54] the answers to the questions
[12:57] not just because you got questions the
[13:00] world's got questions everybody's got
[13:01] questions we've all got questions
[13:04] you know but i believe he's referring to
[13:06] the fact
[13:07] that you know answered questions
[13:11] it really makes a strong church and two
[13:13] then you find out what's on the people's
[13:15] mind
[13:16] you know you can see kind of what what
[13:17] you're thinking about
[13:19] by the questions or to see if they
[13:22] understand what you're talking about
[13:24] on the question all right but now
[13:28] i tried to speak a little bit there
[13:29] wednesday night and i pray that
[13:32] some of you that was not able to come i
[13:34] would ask you to listen to that message
[13:37] uh and study it over and over
[13:40] because uh i believe
[13:45] that anybody at all would be in any
[13:48] human
[13:48] sense that would be thinking about that
[13:52] we're at the end of all things
[13:55] you know that so all of things is at
[13:58] hand
[13:58] first peter 4 verse 7. and i believe
[14:02] that
[14:03] that we're down here at the end of it
[14:06] and we look around and we see the world
[14:08] and how it's doing
[14:10] now everything's falling apart and all
[14:14] and then we can see that we've studied
[14:17] the word of god we've looked forward to
[14:19] a time and we see that
[14:21] that it speaks of the end time and and
[14:24] the things of like matthew 24 you know
[14:27] earthquakes and diverse places
[14:30] all kind of things happening
[14:34] around the world and we should all
[14:37] believe
[14:38] that we are in the end time now when we
[14:40] talk about it being in the end time
[14:42] we've never made any dates
[14:44] and times and seasons but i think it's
[14:46] about time like the prophet said one day
[14:49] he said something about you know the end
[14:51] and they said well you're setting a date
[14:53] he said no
[14:54] no no i'm not doing that and you say
[14:57] that it
[14:58] could be the week or the month he said i
[15:00] didn't say the day
[15:02] i just said it could be the week or the
[15:04] month well
[15:05] see then that's what the bible says no
[15:07] man knows the day in
[15:09] the hour well that's true we'll get back
[15:12] to that in a minute
[15:13] see nobody does know even jesus didn't
[15:17] know
[15:18] when he was coming but now we've got to
[15:22] bring that
[15:22] over with the prophet's message that
[15:25] would even he would say back there to
[15:27] them
[15:28] that he didn't know about his second
[15:30] coming
[15:32] all right but then he says when he comes
[15:34] over into the book of revelations
[15:37] he's already experienced all of the
[15:39] things he's coming back to the church
[15:43] to show the church of his coming
[15:48] all right now i've tried to make some
[15:51] points i'll make this and then i'll pick
[15:52] it up later
[15:54] see i believe that the coming of the
[15:55] lord has been taking place ever since
[15:58] the day of the holy ghost fell and jesus
[16:01] fell on
[16:01] the day of pentecost but it's not
[16:05] in this um correct
[16:08] stage but see each age was looking
[16:13] for the coming of the lord
[16:16] and that we know that paul as brother
[16:18] brown says was trying to get the people
[16:20] out of their mind that jesus was coming
[16:23] right then
[16:24] we thought that it was telling that it'd
[16:26] be here next week you know or
[16:28] whatever but he said that wasn't right
[16:30] said it's got to be a falling way first
[16:32] all right so then in that we know that
[16:35] certain things
[16:36] have got to happen to bring about the
[16:38] finishing up
[16:40] of the coming of the lord but i believe
[16:42] every time a person is born again
[16:44] the lord comes to you amen
[16:47] to live in your soul by the new birth
[16:50] amen all right
[16:51] now that doesn't do away with his coming
[16:54] that just starts it right
[16:58] amen that just brings into being is all
[17:00] that we'll get to in a minute where
[17:02] the prophet said he comes three times
[17:05] all right
[17:06] one to redeem one time with his bride
[17:10] and the last time i mean one time to
[17:12] catch his bride away
[17:13] second part third part will be coming in
[17:16] the millennium with his bride
[17:18] all right but we're not concerned with
[17:20] the first part
[17:22] in the basis of trying to get it to
[17:23] happen again
[17:25] because it's already transpired all
[17:27] right there's no need to worry about the
[17:30] third stage of coming into the
[17:32] millennium because
[17:33] we got a long ways to go yet before that
[17:36] transpires
[17:37] all right now but we better be concerned
[17:41] with where we are now
[17:44] and what's taking place all right we
[17:46] look around at the world
[17:48] as i say in wednesday we look at the
[17:51] world and we see the things
[17:53] we see the signs the the things that
[17:56] happening
[17:57] that has been spoken of well why can't
[18:00] we do as the prophet
[18:02] said they done when peter said they're
[18:05] in the book of acts this is
[18:08] that all right
[18:12] now why can't we say that
[18:15] see brother branham said this is that
[18:19] and he said now if this is not that let
[18:22] me keep this
[18:23] until that comes but if you'll go on
[18:25] reading and listening
[18:26] you'll hear him say this is that
[18:30] because it was to him all right
[18:34] and then he could say the lord is here
[18:39] and believe it but my point has been for
[18:42] quite a while is what
[18:46] when are we going to believe that we're
[18:48] in the
[18:50] stages advents you remember the word the
[18:53] prophet used he said he comes with three
[18:54] advents
[18:56] stages or whatever when are we going to
[18:58] believe
[18:59] where we're at that's it amen
[19:02] we can look at the world we can see all
[19:04] the things
[19:06] and we can say this is that scripture's
[19:08] fulfilled
[19:11] the prophet spoke of a bride
[19:15] that would become the word in the end
[19:17] time
[19:19] all right now
[19:23] i'm content this is that
[19:26] amen if not when is it going to be
[19:31] you know i mean you know plain language
[19:35] if this ain't that if something ain't
[19:36] taking place when is it going to be
[19:40] well i just don't see it well i swear
[19:42] you're blind
[19:44] you accept our with 20 20 vision and
[19:47] study everything in the world and still
[19:49] be blind as a bad
[19:52] because we don't believe this is that
[19:56] all right now are you following me
[19:59] you look at the world and you see the
[20:00] great things that are happening
[20:03] well is not that what this bible
[20:07] said would take place right
[20:11] all right so this is that
[20:14] this is that that the bible spoke of
[20:18] we talk about the towers falling you
[20:20] know
[20:21] we talk about the sun and the the things
[20:25] we talk about the uh the word coming
[20:27] before the watergate
[20:29] which is familiar with our days and
[20:31] times you know
[20:35] and we say this is that earthquakes in
[20:39] diverse places
[20:40] we listened to a tape the other night in
[20:42] 54
[20:44] where brother brown was talking about
[20:45] tidal waves
[20:48] well see now we had them back there and
[20:51] they've always been kind of in that word
[20:53] way but what i like about
[20:57] life i get tickled at all of us we want
[21:00] to always try to make everything
[21:02] look big and and
[21:05] you know i can't even pronounce that big
[21:07] old word
[21:08] you saw me tsunami
[21:11] kumamis or what are mummies it's a big
[21:14] old tidal wave
[21:17] okay but everybody wants that big old
[21:19] word
[21:21] and they want to sit down and talk and
[21:22] they want to say what is your input
[21:29] everybody wants to be big with their
[21:31] words why not just say what do you think
[21:35] what do you got to say about it in the
[21:37] end times it says there'll be
[21:39] tidal waves well you know they never was
[21:42] called that big old long word back there
[21:44] they had them but not like now
[21:48] that was 54 and said look at him said
[21:50] they don't know what's taking place
[21:52] i said here comes tidal waves
[21:56] you know nothing going on
[21:59] if they didn't have all this
[22:00] sophisticated equipment
[22:03] look how many people would be killed
[22:04] because a lot of times that big old long
[22:06] word you talking about the tidal way
[22:08] it it just starts out in the ocean
[22:10] because of an earthquake or something
[22:12] and it just comes into land and you
[22:14] don't know it's there until it gets
[22:15] there
[22:16] 500 mile an hour
[22:20] right that's the speed of it there's no
[22:22] way to outrun it
[22:26] but why can't we say this is that
[22:30] i mean at least the natural things
[22:35] at least the natural world
[22:40] it's coming to an end what this is that
[22:43] the bible spoke of
[22:44] amen all right we had a prophet's
[22:48] message
[22:49] right we believe that prophet's message
[22:52] we're not looking for another prophet to
[22:54] come we're not looking for all of these
[22:56] things
[22:57] that people are looking for and trying
[22:58] to figure out
[23:01] we believe it's already come we believe
[23:04] the lord has already descended from
[23:06] heaven with a what
[23:08] a shout out all right
[23:12] and we believe that the lord jesus
[23:14] brought around and said in the rapture
[23:16] does all three of these things shout to
[23:18] voiceover
[23:19] and the trumpet in his descending
[23:24] well then why are we looking up there to
[23:26] go somewhere
[23:27] we better be concerned with what's
[23:29] transpiring here
[23:31] but why can't we say this is that
[23:36] you see what i was getting that
[23:37] wednesday night
[23:40] see to me this is
[23:44] not just speaking of it
[23:48] but if the coming of the lord is in
[23:49] three stages
[23:51] one to redeem his bride one to catch
[23:54] away his bride
[23:55] and one with his bride in the millennium
[23:58] well why can't we say
[24:00] that this is that
[24:03] the coming of the lord to take his bride
[24:07] away or when are we going to say it
[24:12] well just remember you can go down in
[24:14] the basement
[24:15] you can close your eyes and you can sit
[24:18] down there
[24:19] the sun's going to come up in the
[24:20] morning
[24:24] it's going to come up it'll make no
[24:26] difference
[24:27] even if there's a big black cloud to
[24:29] cover it over that still don't mean it
[24:31] didn't come up
[24:33] it's coming up in the morning all right
[24:36] well maybe my faith will stop it or go
[24:39] ahead
[24:41] because there's no promise in the bible
[24:44] for you to do that
[24:46] all right but you see what i was trying
[24:48] to get at tying together
[24:50] all of the things
[24:56] see then what are we looking for
[25:00] what are you looking for
[25:04] malachi 4 said he'll send you elijah the
[25:06] prophet
[25:07] amen well you know what
[25:10] do anybody just listening i'm holding up
[25:12] quotes from the prophet i believe this
[25:14] is that
[25:17] amen you know i believe this is
[25:20] that amen they will spoke up all right
[25:24] but if not you better be looking for
[25:25] nothing to come you better be searching
[25:27] for some guy that
[25:29] got some kind of going on and we don't
[25:31] want to do that right
[25:33] all right luke 17 30 are we looking for
[25:36] another
[25:37] time of the son of man
[25:44] or can we say this is that right that's
[25:46] right
[25:49] now i wrote this yesterday
[25:53] so if you think i'm saying something
[25:56] about you or your thoughts or whatever
[25:58] you think on what you want to i don't
[26:00] change my thoughts because of you
[26:03] i change it because of what he tells me
[26:05] but not because of anybody
[26:08] see if we don't see that this is that
[26:11] that was spoken of
[26:12] in the word we better start looking for
[26:16] that to come
[26:17] right i believe the lord jesus christ
[26:22] died two thousand years ago
[26:23] on a cross to pay for my sins don't you
[26:27] well this is that i've experienced that
[26:30] all right if if i don't believe that
[26:33] then i'd be looking for a messiah to
[26:35] come
[26:36] i'd run over to the jews and join up
[26:37] with them
[26:39] right but you see this is that
[26:43] but if we believe this is that
[26:51] why should not we be excited
[26:55] about it
[27:00] but it's like i told you over and over
[27:04] no telling how many times martin luther
[27:06] preached on the judge shall live by
[27:08] faith
[27:09] maybe done documentaries on him maybe
[27:11] done taught
[27:12] classes on it
[27:16] but he was like moses with his mama
[27:18] telling him he was a deliverer
[27:21] and that was good
[27:24] but the prophet said five minutes in
[27:26] front of the burning bush
[27:28] was more than all the mom was talking
[27:34] see then why can't we
[27:37] believe where we're at
[27:40] i'm not looking for the shout to come
[27:41] are you
[27:43] we've been heard shout i'm not looking
[27:46] for him to die again
[27:48] he's already come and died for our sins
[27:53] and i'm not concerned about the
[27:54] millennium because according to my
[27:57] understanding
[27:58] we've got to have a rapture then we've
[28:00] got to have three and a half years of
[28:01] tribulation for the jews
[28:03] and then we've got to have a period of
[28:05] time in there and then we come riding
[28:07] back in the millennium
[28:08] so that's quite a ways on down there's
[28:11] no need of being worried about it
[28:14] but that's what everybody wants a man
[28:15] gave me a book years ago
[28:18] i'll get to it this evening on some
[28:19] other time but he gave me a book
[28:23] he wanted to know what 77 was
[28:28] and he gave me a i mean
[28:31] it was that thick and he said i want you
[28:33] to put the quotes and the notes and the
[28:35] things in there
[28:37] well i never put a one in there because
[28:39] he wasn't concerned with anything else
[28:41] all he was concerned about was what was
[28:43] going on there
[28:45] and like i say to you see most of you
[28:48] your mind thinks of
[28:50] you're not concerned with what's going
[28:51] on now i wonder what's going to be in
[28:53] the millennium
[28:55] well what are you doing it's not here
[29:00] and you know what your unbelief ain't
[29:03] going to change it
[29:09] let's wait till that gets here they'd be
[29:12] like trying to make jesus get up on the
[29:14] cross and die again
[29:15] because we didn't like what he done or
[29:16] the way done it
[29:19] but yeah what are we recognizing your
[29:22] day
[29:23] in this message we've had the prophet's
[29:27] message
[29:27] we believe that but where's the voice of
[29:30] the archangel supposed to be
[29:31] if jesus is descending
[29:34] with the voice of the archangel come on
[29:37] it's going to have to be here on earth
[29:41] then the trumpet sounds but remember the
[29:43] trumpet to curse away
[29:46] to meet him in the air there's got to be
[29:48] a resurrection before then
[29:51] you see what i've been trying to bring
[29:53] to us see
[29:55] that voice of the archangel is the lord
[29:57] jesus christ
[29:59] and where is that to be
[30:03] come on didn't we give it
[30:06] he said he's waiting on you and i
[30:09] adoption time
[30:11] when he can pour in his fullness that's
[30:12] what the holy ghost given for
[30:16] come visible among us raise the dead
[30:19] and we go in the rapture all right
[30:24] then it's got to be in you and i am
[30:30] if not we're still waiting on something
[30:32] that's right see to become visible among
[30:34] us all right
[30:37] now
[30:42] i got a lot of quotes and i'll be glad
[30:44] to give you the things but i'll just try
[30:46] to
[30:46] scan through because i've used these but
[30:49] this is what i decided to do to
[30:51] read a little bit or to scan through the
[30:52] quotes they'll be on the internet so
[30:54] that people can read them
[30:56] and uh you know out there so then they
[30:58] won't be lost
[31:00] but most of you have heard these things
[31:03] but then we'll go
[31:04] through some things that i want to lay
[31:06] down
[31:07] and then just make a few comments this
[31:10] afternoon we'll have questions and
[31:11] answers the lord willing
[31:13] you know upon the things and i have no
[31:16] problems
[31:17] with saying i don't know
[31:22] that's the one thing preachers don't
[31:24] like to admit
[31:27] they'll run around it and beat around it
[31:29] and scream about it and
[31:30] you know make you think they know what
[31:32] they're talking about
[31:33] but aaron roberts the first time that he
[31:36] called me up and asked me a question
[31:38] i said i don't know he said i thought
[31:43] brother dale was supposed to know
[31:44] everything well
[31:47] he doesn't and no problems
[31:51] but i'm ever learning i hope i'm just
[31:54] coming to the knowledge of the truth you
[31:56] know
[31:57] but not missing you but we've been
[32:00] through it quite a bit right
[32:02] there'll be three advents to the coming
[32:03] of the lord jesus
[32:05] the first time to redeem his bride
[32:10] when he died for her second to receive
[32:13] his bride
[32:14] when he comes for her third will be his
[32:17] bride
[32:18] with his bride for the millennium
[32:21] there'll be three advents this is 1954
[32:25] the great revival and the outpouring of
[32:27] the holy spirit
[32:29] there will be three advents and one of
[32:31] them is past
[32:34] and the signpost and showing that we're
[32:37] near the second advent of the lord jesus
[32:47] first one's already pious and we're in
[32:49] the second advent well why are we
[32:51] worried about anything else
[32:53] well i'd like to know what's going on in
[32:54] the millennium
[32:58] i'm human being i like to look at things
[33:00] and see things
[33:02] but what good is that going to be if i'm
[33:04] not there
[33:08] you know because if we if we don't come
[33:11] into this one
[33:13] i told you this 40 years ago if this
[33:16] bride of christ cannot come to rapture
[33:18] in faith
[33:21] then there's no hopes of anybody in the
[33:22] world being raised in the dead
[33:28] i'll make that blunt i'll still make it
[33:30] blunt
[33:31] this is not just a time run out
[33:35] of this happening
[33:38] but this is that amen
[33:42] see comes three times questions and
[33:44] answers 54
[33:48] one to redeem second time
[33:51] to receive his church third time to be
[33:54] caught away
[33:58] that was 54 questions and answers to 57
[34:01] if they roll these fights enough all
[34:03] right but i ain't worried about it
[34:05] because it doesn't give you these and
[34:07] when jesus returns he comes with the
[34:09] bride
[34:10] jesus comes three times he come the
[34:13] first time to redeem his bride he come
[34:14] to set comes the second
[34:16] time to receive his church he comes the
[34:19] third time with his church
[34:20] so it's all one great perfect
[34:24] coming
[34:28] one great perfect coming
[34:31] but in three parts
[34:36] well see when are we going to believe it
[34:42] ten virgins 1960. his coming is in three
[34:46] the first time he came to redeem his
[34:47] bride second time he comes to
[34:48] catch away his bride like a love affair
[34:51] comes around
[34:52] and steals her out at night time takes
[34:55] her away from the world
[34:57] meet him in the air the secret coming
[35:00] of the lord see the second time he come
[35:03] is to receive the bride first to redeem
[35:06] second to receive
[35:08] third time with her king and queen
[35:12] but do we believe that well now we've
[35:15] got
[35:16] to be somewhere
[35:19] in one of those three stages would you
[35:21] admit that
[35:22] right well one's christ
[35:26] another one's after we leave the world
[35:27] three and a half years at least on packs
[35:29] where we're at
[35:34] so what should we be concerned with
[35:38] 61 jesus comes three times he come to
[35:41] redeem his bride he comes
[35:44] the second time to catch her away he
[35:47] comes a third time with her
[35:48] redeem his bride receive his bride bring
[35:51] him and his bride back his king and
[35:53] queen
[35:56] just think about it
[36:00] the reason i'm bringing it down is
[36:02] because i'm giving it if you follow it
[36:04] it's coming on down starting back there
[36:07] that he saw what he was talking about
[36:09] 54 and we're going all the way up to
[36:13] 64. this is the message paradox 64.
[36:16] he comes three times one time he comes
[36:18] to redeem his wife
[36:19] next time he comes to catch her away the
[36:22] next time he comes with her
[36:24] three comings all right the future home
[36:28] 1964. now there's
[36:31] pyramid teachings and the different
[36:32] things he said everything's in three
[36:34] jesus comes three times come once to
[36:37] redeem his bride
[36:38] next time to get his bride next time
[36:42] with his pride
[36:45] three comings one's pissed and one of
[36:48] them's wiped
[36:49] up into the future
[36:52] so we shouldn't be concerned with it now
[36:54] listen to what i'm saying
[36:55] because i've made this over and over
[36:57] especially for the internet people
[36:59] you'll say well brother dale don't know
[37:01] what he's talking about there's many
[37:02] i've explained it throughout the series
[37:04] there's many more parts of coming
[37:07] than just to be the things we've covered
[37:12] there's a coming to the jews there's a
[37:15] coming to end the world
[37:17] all kinds of things about his coming but
[37:20] we're not concerned with that
[37:23] so why would your prophet say that
[37:25] there's three comings
[37:29] when he knew there would be a coming to
[37:31] the jews after we leave right
[37:34] but he lists three comings
[37:39] because if this part second phase
[37:42] advent park pace whatever you want to
[37:44] call it
[37:46] if it's not made right and come to the
[37:48] correct position
[37:49] and said a moment ago then the jews
[37:51] don't have a change
[37:53] nobody has a change we just wait until
[37:56] this thing blows up
[37:58] you know or whatever
[38:02] but when are we going to recognize
[38:06] our time as i said about martin luther
[38:13] even though he protested the catholic
[38:15] church with the just shall live by faith
[38:19] they didn't get upset with him come on
[38:22] read your history
[38:23] it's when the people begin
[38:26] to believe what martin luther said
[38:33] then the catholic church got excited
[38:35] because they wasn't concerned about one
[38:37] man
[38:38] it's when the people right begin to
[38:41] become one with what he said
[38:42] and sure we know that even in the
[38:44] natural they went out and burned down
[38:46] buildings and things
[38:47] luther said i didn't say that
[38:51] i didn't tell you to do that i told you
[38:53] get out of it
[38:55] or really luther i've read his writings
[38:57] i got it home
[38:58] on some of it he didn't want to leave
[39:00] the catholic church
[39:02] he wanted his life called reform he
[39:05] wanted to reform the church
[39:08] he wanted to stay
[39:12] they drove him out why because the
[39:15] people
[39:15] started believing what he said
[39:20] sure in brother brown's day the world
[39:23] was against him yes
[39:27] but why did it go
[39:30] you know i know that there was a problem
[39:32] back there we were coming along in
[39:34] 68 you know 67
[39:37] and some of you was back with him in his
[39:40] ministry
[39:42] but there wasn't a lot of protesting
[39:43] going on right
[39:45] with a lot of troubles going on
[39:49] everybody wanted him right
[39:53] until he began to preach the word
[39:56] just like the lord jesus right when he
[39:59] started preaching the word they got
[40:00] against him
[40:01] he said when you begin to say i and my
[40:03] father one and these other things he
[40:05] said
[40:07] all right but look see
[40:10] in the past
[40:13] we started with a lot of doctrines and
[40:16] ideas and twists and things
[40:19] to try to deceive the people but then
[40:24] that
[40:24] began to quieten down
[40:28] you know there wasn't a lot of doctrinal
[40:30] ideas coming along
[40:31] after say 80 something
[40:34] 90 at the most that was when you began
[40:38] to get all of those
[40:39] he started out way on back with the two
[40:41] souls and the two lords and the
[40:43] peruses and the you know all of the
[40:46] things
[40:47] but it kind of got a low i watched that
[40:49] i've told you about it before
[40:51] they were kind of lull in the doctrines
[40:53] all at once there were two or three
[40:54] little fling ups
[40:56] now they got the river jordan going to
[40:58] jesus wouldn't god until the river
[41:00] jordan you know
[41:01] and then he'd finally become god and god
[41:03] left him and he died a man and
[41:06] all kind of doctrines
[41:09] but yet there hadn't been a lot of
[41:10] flying around
[41:14] so what was the next stage it struck
[41:23] they began to show how wrong he was
[41:29] right even the two souls the two lords
[41:32] and everybody they claim
[41:33] the message was right they claimed the
[41:36] prophet was right sure there was a
[41:37] little
[41:38] little nitpickings down through there
[41:41] this part about the out there in arizona
[41:44] and the dates being wrong
[41:46] we knew about that in 68
[41:50] and 70s but there wasn't a lot said
[41:53] about it
[41:56] but you see it kind of when it got
[41:57] through the doctrinal parts then all at
[41:59] once they started attacking the
[42:02] messenger
[42:06] why because if they could destroy the
[42:10] messenger
[42:12] it would destroy your confidence in the
[42:15] message
[42:16] amen right
[42:22] i know one brother that preached here
[42:24] one time as a matter of fact he preached
[42:25] one of his first sermons here
[42:28] and uh well he was really on fire really
[42:31] going
[42:33] you know what he read one day he read it
[42:35] brother branham said if you see one
[42:36] thing
[42:37] you remember the quote if i'm wrong on
[42:39] one thing i said deny it all then
[42:41] something to that degree paraphrasing it
[42:44] well then when that came up about the
[42:46] wrong dates he just
[42:50] told the message away
[42:53] so you destroy the confidence of the
[42:55] people
[42:57] as to the word of god
[43:02] where are they going
[43:09] you see that's why i've made my
[43:10] challenge on the internet to come and
[43:12] show me where he was wrong
[43:14] you say challenge well everyone
[43:17] everyone's bringing it up it ain't me
[43:20] i didn't start all the doctrines
[43:23] you remember about a year or two ago i
[43:25] put a series in
[43:27] of the doctrines i didn't believe in
[43:31] and why i didn't believe them two souls
[43:34] we went through that see brother random
[43:38] never taught that satan give you a soul
[43:42] because that would make him a creator
[43:45] and you done missed it
[43:47] if satan can create he perverts
[43:51] he doesn't create he can't create
[43:56] the bible says all souls are
[43:59] mine and i went through all the
[44:01] doctrines
[44:04] i figured man that i'd be so loaded on
[44:06] the internet until
[44:07] we'd have to set aside three secretaries
[44:09] to take care of the answer and the
[44:11] questions
[44:13] i got one comment
[44:16] and that was about the two lords and all
[44:19] it was then was
[44:21] you just don't understand what the
[44:23] brother
[44:24] talked
[44:30] i agree i didn't understand what he
[44:32] taught
[44:35] because and that's what i've done i
[44:38] didn't argue back i never even wrote
[44:39] them a comment because i told you i'm
[44:40] not going to comment on that internet
[44:43] but i did do one thing the next service
[44:45] i figured they'd be listening
[44:46] i said if you'll listen i'll explain why
[44:48] i sat down i said because the brother
[44:50] himself said
[44:52] that jesus and god was too separate's
[44:56] identity
[44:59] and i ain't saying no more if you're two
[45:02] separate identities
[45:03] you've gone back to the trinity but you
[45:06] see what i'm getting at the point
[45:09] see my point is the one thing
[45:13] once they went so far with their
[45:15] doctrinal issues
[45:19] the people got to get tired of all these
[45:21] new things and they wouldn't follow
[45:22] them like they did so they had to attack
[45:26] another way what
[45:28] oh he was wrong he's wrong here and he's
[45:30] wrong here he's wrong here he's wrong
[45:32] here
[45:33] first thing you do on the internet you
[45:34] want to go in my office sit down
[45:36] type in william bratton it'll come up
[45:39] the first thing it'll tell you
[45:41] all the wrongs
[45:52] see in our day we couldn't have nothing
[45:55] to be able to read
[45:57] the first book that we found of anything
[45:59] related to brother branham
[46:01] by the world was um god's generals
[46:06] that was the first one it appeared to
[46:08] say anything
[46:10] contrary or good or whatever you know
[46:12] i'm not talking about the
[46:13] 20th century prophet book i'm not about
[46:15] what the world wrote of him
[46:17] but you see what i'm talking about what
[46:20] created
[46:20] this problem the devil knows
[46:26] if he can stop you from believing what
[46:28] the prophet taught
[46:31] he's got you defeated
[46:36] that's what i see around the land
[46:38] because the devil don't have to have
[46:39] help
[46:40] he's got plenty of preachers
[46:45] he don't have to do nothing he's on
[46:46] vacation
[46:52] but you see church what i'm trying to
[46:55] get you to see
[46:56] is if we don't
[47:00] recognize who we are and start
[47:04] believing who we are as i said about
[47:06] luther
[47:07] don't tell him how many times he
[47:08] preached that but one day that joshua
[47:11] lived by faith
[47:12] jumped off that page in a man's heart
[47:15] and when he got the people to believe
[47:17] that
[47:19] oh the catholic church got upset
[47:24] well you're getting a few people around
[47:25] the world today that's getting fed up
[47:27] with all of this
[47:29] hubba law that's going around the
[47:33] so-called message people
[47:37] and they're beginning to say i don't
[47:40] believe that
[47:43] let me keep this if that is what you got
[47:47] if that's that
[47:48] let me keep this because i don't believe
[47:50] that
[47:53] i believe the message of the hour and i
[47:56] believe what he said
[48:00] all right like i said then we come up to
[48:03] where we were talking about
[48:04] what was the holy ghost given for read
[48:06] around said
[48:07] god's waiting on me and you the church
[48:10] is waiting on me and you
[48:12] adoption time when god can pour into us
[48:15] his fullness his power his resurrection
[48:20] that when the church in christ becomes
[48:22] so close together
[48:24] till christ becomes visible among us
[48:27] and raises the dead and we go in the
[48:32] rapture
[48:34] like we've got to recognize we got to
[48:36] recognize it correctly though
[48:38] don't you remember this one
[48:41] where he said in 55 in proof of the
[48:44] resurrection
[48:47] he said christ showed himself visible
[48:50] among the early risers
[48:54] and he never showed it anymore
[48:57] through this family of the day
[49:02] the evening time
[49:05] then he made himself known again for he
[49:07] was alpha and omega
[49:13] that didn't mean there wasn't nothing
[49:14] down to the ages
[49:18] he's talking about something visible
[49:23] something not necessarily tangible
[49:28] because that's where we get confused
[49:30] with something visible
[49:33] jesus had the sign of the son of man
[49:35] right
[49:38] we did not the prophet in the end time
[49:40] of the son of the son of man
[49:45] so he's come back in the end time
[49:47] visible
[49:49] he says among us
[49:52] arrows of god's deliverance shot from
[49:55] above
[49:56] 1956. so we're glad that we've
[50:00] got a living god we've got one who
[50:03] promised
[50:04] us he's right here with us
[50:07] showing himself visible among us
[50:14] right i believe in the prophet's message
[50:19] that god showed himself visible not
[50:21] physical visible
[50:22] there's a lot of difference invisible
[50:24] physical
[50:26] he was not the son of man he was a son
[50:28] of man
[50:29] that the son of man used to speak all
[50:32] right
[50:34] but yet how close could you get to it
[50:39] of what he was looking at that he would
[50:42] become visible
[50:47] not like it was down to the ages down
[50:49] through the ages remember what he said
[50:50] he said it's been that he died son of
[50:53] man
[50:54] rose son of god that has been sown on
[50:56] god down through seven church ages
[50:58] but said in the end time is to come back
[51:00] as son of man
[51:01] all right now
[51:05] through the prophet's message then
[51:09] we can understand and like i told you in
[51:13] 1969 in athens georgia
[51:15] the first sermon i preached was that the
[51:17] bride of jesus christ
[51:19] your prophet said would be the son of
[51:21] man
[51:23] now that's up to you to believe or
[51:25] whatever i want to believe i'm just
[51:26] saying what he said
[51:30] he said the bride would be the fullness
[51:31] of the godhead bodily
[51:35] now i'm not derogatory i'm stating it he
[51:38] didn't say the prophet would be the
[51:39] fullness of the godhead bodily
[51:41] you can't make that you make him jesus
[51:42] christ
[51:44] but you make the bride jesus christ made
[51:46] manifest and you know what
[51:48] brother branham was a part of the bride
[51:49] amen
[51:52] remember we're the only ages had a major
[51:54] prophet
[51:56] that was not only a prophet from birth
[51:59] not only a church messenger
[52:03] right
[52:06] one promised in the bible to come a word
[52:09] prophet
[52:11] but he had the baptism of the holy ghost
[52:14] that none of your prophets in the old
[52:16] testament had
[52:17] they had an anointing of the holy ghost
[52:19] but they were not in the body of christ
[52:21] this man was in the body of christ right
[52:25] come on he said we wonder what john wolf
[52:28] what about the scripture
[52:30] listen to brother brown and talk about
[52:31] it last night john received the baptism
[52:34] of the holy ghost while he's in his
[52:35] mother's womb
[52:36] but the bible says the least in the
[52:38] kingdom
[52:39] is greater than john
[52:43] well go ahead do what you want to but
[52:45] listen
[52:48] become visible
[52:51] think about the day that the prophet was
[52:53] here
[52:54] 1961 forgotten beatitudes there's been a
[52:58] dismal day it certainly has
[53:00] enough light to see how to join church
[53:01] using to make organizations
[53:03] and so forth but that real power and
[53:05] manifestation of the presence of god
[53:07] has not been seen for years and years
[53:09] and years
[53:11] we felt it listen and we know it was
[53:15] here
[53:16] and we've seen gifts working with it
[53:21] come on that get down in his ministry
[53:23] but when we see him come
[53:25] visible among us come watch
[53:28] with power in his church
[53:32] to reach up on the hem of the garment
[53:35] of that master and touch it bring back
[53:38] down his power here
[53:40] and speak to his people here and reveal
[53:43] making him god god with us
[53:46] what about it
[53:51] he comes over in 62 perseverance
[53:54] he said if he let the church go in just
[53:57] on theology
[53:58] and listen to him without showing
[54:02] himself visible among them like that
[54:05] then he's done something for them back
[54:07] there
[54:09] he didn't do for us he ever heard that
[54:12] statement
[54:12] to be made that he had to do it again in
[54:16] the end times see
[54:17] because if he didn't they would just be
[54:19] judged by theology
[54:22] right but no
[54:26] so what is it then what is the coming of
[54:29] the lord brother dale you talk about
[54:31] what did i give you it's rising in the
[54:32] sun he was the first fruits of those
[54:35] that slept
[54:36] in the bride coming of christ coming out
[54:39] of the church
[54:40] there will be a sheep waved again in the
[54:42] last days
[54:44] in the bride coming to christ coming out
[54:46] of the church
[54:48] now isn't that simple
[54:53] i mean brother branham what is the
[54:54] coming of the lord in the second stage
[54:56] that you're speaking of
[54:58] or advent which is not a physical
[55:02] because the corporal body of jesus
[55:03] christ does not come to the earth
[55:06] until the millennial reign so it's not a
[55:09] corporal in the basis of tangible
[55:13] he said that's why your blood on your
[55:15] hands and your forehead
[55:16] he said you're saying the physical body
[55:19] is here
[55:20] and he says you're out of the scripture
[55:23] because the physical body doesn't come
[55:25] brother adam didn't have
[55:26] oil and blood
[55:30] he stood there with a gift he said
[55:32] there's a man sitting right
[55:34] back here behind me said he didn't buy
[55:36] him a pair of shoes cause he said he's
[55:38] dying
[55:40] he said i say you're healed
[55:49] but now listen it's like i told you
[55:52] after brother random pies we were trying
[55:53] to think of the name
[55:55] we got around to some words and names
[55:57] but i still won't use it on tape
[56:00] but right after brother random past
[56:03] the story was told with some big name
[56:05] people
[56:07] got together and went and sat down in a
[56:09] meetings
[56:10] of a man that had a lot of signs and
[56:14] wonders
[56:16] and they were wondering about him
[56:20] you know why they were wondering about
[56:22] it because they thought signs and
[56:24] wonders was all of it
[56:32] they never saw the word the man brought
[56:35] amen satan could pass out supernatural
[56:40] gifts
[56:41] but he can't be the word
[56:46] that's why we don't look for another man
[56:48] to come to straighten out brother
[56:49] branham
[56:52] if you can straighten brother around him
[56:53] out then you've got to be almighty god
[56:57] stick your foot up i'll kiss your toe
[57:00] you say you shouldn't be that arrogant
[57:01] why not it would be true
[57:05] samuel dale or anybody straighten out
[57:08] brother branham
[57:09] you've got to be almighty god to do that
[57:12] a prophet stands before no man
[57:16] that's why he said you say what i say
[57:19] i'll be judged by it
[57:22] and up until those seals broke he
[57:24] preached a white horse rider
[57:26] as the holy ghost you know if those only
[57:30] tapes you've got to hold up
[57:31] you're not responsible brother branham's
[57:35] message is
[57:39] when god won't judge you for something
[57:42] you haven't heard
[57:44] but when we've heard he will judge it
[57:47] amen
[57:50] so what is it
[57:55] look what he said will happen in one in
[57:57] a million
[58:00] did you ever think what the people did
[58:03] he's talking about elijah you know
[58:05] elias must come and he he said he's
[58:08] already come you knew it not
[58:10] they went right on believing that mo
[58:13] that elias was coming
[58:14] right and he was right among them
[58:17] and they didn't know it so will it be in
[58:20] the coming of the son of man
[58:22] they'll do with him just the same thing
[58:25] the spirit of god is here
[58:27] well what are we doing what are we going
[58:29] to do with it
[58:30] are we going to eat manna and so forth
[58:33] and not continually move up as we grow
[58:38] this message was sent for you and i i
[58:41] told you 45 years ago
[58:43] i believe not the 63 doctrine
[58:47] of what they called it the uh coming of
[58:50] the son of man because i didn't agree
[58:52] with that
[58:53] he would make the man deity
[58:56] but i believe that the lord jesus christ
[58:59] come down and spoke to you and i to a
[59:01] prophet
[59:02] and brought a message that message is
[59:05] to the bride now the second coming
[59:09] of jesus christ
[59:12] i said that then why wouldn't i say it
[59:13] now
[59:15] and you know what to show you there's
[59:18] only three coming to the lord
[59:19] you notice this message is going to go
[59:21] to israel
[59:24] right so it'll be the second coming of
[59:28] the lord to israel
[59:31] all right damn it i'm not looking for
[59:33] his coming
[59:34] come on
[59:39] he's here amen but when are we gonna
[59:42] believe it
[59:43] right well i don't see it pity party
[59:47] you'll never see it with that attitude
[59:51] that's right as i started the message
[59:54] off at least you can say this is that
[59:56] at least we can say the world out here
[59:58] has come to the place that has fulfilled
[1:00:00] the bible
[1:00:03] but why can't we say this message is
[1:00:05] back
[1:00:10] now i've never been but one thing in
[1:00:12] plain blunt
[1:00:14] if you're looking for something else
[1:00:15] beside this message
[1:00:18] to bring you to perfection then you're
[1:00:21] hell-bound
[1:00:23] because there's no hopes of nobody
[1:00:25] else's message nobody else brought a
[1:00:28] message
[1:00:29] oral roberts billy graham none of them
[1:00:32] brought a message
[1:00:33] the schoolers the swaggers none of them
[1:00:36] had a message
[1:00:37] and brother branham said if you come
[1:00:42] with signs and wonders
[1:00:46] but keep the same old simple message
[1:00:50] he said you miss it now you know he's
[1:00:53] not talking about his message
[1:00:54] because his message was life there's no
[1:00:57] life outside of this message
[1:00:59] now i didn't say people couldn't be
[1:01:01] saved because that's up to god
[1:01:03] remember the message we talked about the
[1:01:05] appearing
[1:01:07] and the coming you can appear right over
[1:01:09] there today
[1:01:10] and save a person but that has nothing
[1:01:13] to do with his coming
[1:01:14] except coming in them and a newborn it
[1:01:16] has nothing to do with the end time
[1:01:18] message
[1:01:18] they don't know what it is
[1:01:22] what are you following me he's coming
[1:01:26] after a bride without spot
[1:01:28] wrinkle or blemish he said there'll be a
[1:01:31] little bitty group
[1:01:37] the secret coming of the lord jesus
[1:01:41] shall be taken away
[1:01:45] secret coming of the lord jesus amen
[1:01:50] the second stage of this coming is all
[1:01:51] we're concerned with right
[1:01:55] parts over there don't worry about it
[1:01:57] parks done ben
[1:01:59] amen we got it but you could give that
[1:02:02] right over there today
[1:02:04] the holy ghost could give somebody the
[1:02:05] new birth
[1:02:07] in a denominational church because i
[1:02:09] know most people don't believe that
[1:02:11] that's all right that's your business
[1:02:14] but i will quote the prophet he said a
[1:02:17] puppy dog with an egg under well that's
[1:02:19] the dad
[1:02:20] the egg so do what you want to
[1:02:24] now i will say this much if that new
[1:02:27] birth comes to a person right over there
[1:02:29] they ain't gonna steal their love so
[1:02:31] they gonna start talking about it jesus
[1:02:33] is real
[1:02:34] and they're going to let them know to
[1:02:35] walk across the street
[1:02:38] right we have told a few people here
[1:02:42] that came in
[1:02:43] looking for food they need to go across
[1:02:45] the street
[1:02:47] most of you don't know there's a street
[1:02:48] between here
[1:02:51] fourth street is missing but it's right
[1:02:54] between there
[1:02:56] so they cross the street
[1:03:00] listen folks when are we going to
[1:03:02] believe it
[1:03:04] the secret coming the prophet spoke of
[1:03:09] of the lord jesus persevere 64.
[1:03:13] excuse me presence of god unrecognized
[1:03:16] coming to the lord is going to be a
[1:03:18] secret coming
[1:03:20] he said it'd be too in the bed
[1:03:25] but people will say you're going on down
[1:03:27] reading that
[1:03:30] you know that brother branham made an
[1:03:32] outstanding statement one time
[1:03:34] and it's in here paraphrasing part of
[1:03:38] when he said people who go right on
[1:03:40] thinking they're being saved
[1:03:41] that's right thinking they're getting
[1:03:44] the holy ghost
[1:03:48] he said he's already come
[1:03:54] brother dan what are you looking for in
[1:03:56] this
[1:03:57] second advent phase stage whatever you
[1:03:59] want to use
[1:04:02] coming to catch us right away is the
[1:04:04] stage what are you looking for
[1:04:08] signs and wonders go on follow your
[1:04:11] signs and wonders
[1:04:17] the coming of the lord and what we're
[1:04:21] now
[1:04:21] we need to be concerned about is the
[1:04:23] revealing of his word
[1:04:30] or else you're looking for something
[1:04:32] else
[1:04:35] come on i'm not i've been blunt
[1:04:38] that's what i'm blunt and blind you're
[1:04:41] looking for something else to come
[1:04:43] if this is not a foundation for that
[1:04:47] if this message that we have is not a
[1:04:49] foundation for
[1:04:50] then don't worry about believing it
[1:04:52] because you won't be able to understand
[1:04:53] it
[1:04:56] we've got to be ready
[1:05:00] we've got to be ready
[1:05:04] so they're going to say i thought there
[1:05:05] was going to a church was going to go in
[1:05:07] the rapture
[1:05:08] you say you missed it
[1:05:12] it's done gone
[1:05:15] think about it evidently it must be a
[1:05:16] very much of a secret
[1:05:18] coming that we tried to preach the other
[1:05:20] night about
[1:05:24] a secret coming now a little background
[1:05:28] for this afternoon and then we'll
[1:05:34] quit
[1:05:36] secret coming christ
[1:05:39] mr god revealed brother around says
[1:05:42] that the coming of the lord is in
[1:05:43] mystery
[1:05:48] and he even states a phrase in another
[1:05:50] tape there
[1:05:51] about he said she won't even know
[1:05:55] well you know what he said jesus didn't
[1:05:57] know when he was coming
[1:05:59] but said after he got to the book of
[1:06:01] acts i mean the book of revelations
[1:06:03] he said in that his present time he
[1:06:05] knows
[1:06:08] and when he come to the book of
[1:06:09] revelation and started writing the book
[1:06:10] of revelation he knew when he was coming
[1:06:12] because he had went back to the father
[1:06:15] in the basis of
[1:06:17] connecting together that's why i read
[1:06:19] that god may be
[1:06:20] all in all
[1:06:23] that the son would be subject
[1:06:28] not done away with not terminated would
[1:06:30] be subject
[1:06:35] the prophet places that in the
[1:06:37] millennium
[1:06:38] that he'll come to that place to be all
[1:06:41] in all
[1:06:42] any places in the future home i'll be
[1:06:45] glad to show you the two different times
[1:06:48] that he places that scripture that god
[1:06:51] may be
[1:06:51] all in all
[1:06:56] he said the rapture is only for the
[1:06:58] royal seat of abraham
[1:07:06] the coming of the lord cannot be
[1:07:07] comprehended by the world is that true
[1:07:12] amen what was the secret that was left
[1:07:16] in the bible
[1:07:22] that no one even hardly knew anything
[1:07:23] about it until this end time
[1:07:25] whatsoever your scholars spoke a little
[1:07:27] of it
[1:07:31] it was the coming of the lord
[1:07:35] oh but brother you don't understand your
[1:07:37] scripture
[1:07:38] one day ever i'll see him
[1:07:43] that can't be in our time frame
[1:07:47] i don't care how much internet you've
[1:07:48] got and how much
[1:07:50] our ways you're running all this thing
[1:07:52] there's people in this world could never
[1:07:54] see the coming of jesus christ
[1:07:55] in that form so that must be
[1:07:58] a millennial scripture that ever eye
[1:08:02] shall see him
[1:08:06] but he can't be placed in a time element
[1:08:10] but you see that's where we take it but
[1:08:11] you don't understand ever i'll see him
[1:08:13] i've been taught that all my life ever
[1:08:15] i'll see him we'll all be standing
[1:08:16] looking up
[1:08:17] and it's a secret coming one in the bed
[1:08:21] jesus broke up
[1:08:22] right two in a bed one taking one lap
[1:08:28] i got a few of them in here where he
[1:08:29] says 500 people come up missing every
[1:08:36] day
[1:08:39] you see it still says fear not little
[1:08:41] flock now you know what i've said about
[1:08:44] it
[1:08:44] some people take that and try to cram it
[1:08:46] down you as to see there
[1:08:48] there's too many people following the
[1:08:49] message now there's not enough people
[1:08:51] following this
[1:08:54] i would love to see the world following
[1:08:56] this message
[1:08:58] it would make a good world
[1:09:02] but you know it's not going to happen
[1:09:04] because jesus said fear not little flock
[1:09:07] what brother brown say one day i doubt a
[1:09:10] dozen
[1:09:12] out of this interaction
[1:09:17] did he mean just a dozen or years
[1:09:21] well he said now that's what we want to
[1:09:25] make it
[1:09:27] we want to make what he says what we
[1:09:32] believe
[1:09:34] so what is the coming of the lord to you
[1:09:39] he'll split the eastern skies and he'll
[1:09:41] come down and there'll be a great shout
[1:09:43] then there'll be a voice of the
[1:09:45] resurrection some archangel standing
[1:09:47] down here
[1:09:48] and then a great big trumpet dude
[1:09:52] i think it's about time to get off
[1:09:54] grandma's doctrine
[1:09:56] you know what ain't going off on grandma
[1:10:00] because she believed the best you could
[1:10:02] you know nobody explained it to her we
[1:10:05] had a prophet to explain it
[1:10:09] but to shout is the voice i mean the the
[1:10:11] message
[1:10:12] the voice of the archangel is the same
[1:10:15] lord jesus
[1:10:18] he raised lazarus we'll be here but then
[1:10:21] we got his explanation that he'll not be
[1:10:23] here
[1:10:24] in a corporal 16 element
[1:10:28] body
[1:10:31] you realize how much you'd mess the
[1:10:33] scriptures up if you brought him back
[1:10:35] here
[1:10:35] in a corporal body
[1:10:38] you don't even think like that i know
[1:10:43] but you bring him back right now in a
[1:10:44] corporal body and standing on earth
[1:10:46] and his bride's here he's got two bodies
[1:10:50] now you're back to your two souls your
[1:10:53] two lords
[1:10:54] you're all kind of doctrines you don't
[1:10:56] realize that's what they were doing back
[1:10:58] there
[1:11:02] trying to destroy his coming
[1:11:08] how many of you would have liked to been
[1:11:09] standing with me the day i said in 69
[1:11:12] and read what the prophet said because i
[1:11:14] still got them in the front of my bible
[1:11:16] that the bride of jesus christ would be
[1:11:18] the son of man
[1:11:21] brother branham sleeps on a man he said
[1:11:24] he's not so
[1:11:26] well are you gonna make the bride
[1:11:27] something that he's not
[1:11:32] i'm gonna show you how you miss what
[1:11:34] somebody says you're gonna make brother
[1:11:36] around with something that
[1:11:41] come on you see yeah but you said while
[1:11:44] ago the bride
[1:11:46] you said it again would be the fullness
[1:11:48] of the godhead bodily
[1:11:49] i didn't say that brother branham did
[1:11:55] that's too dumb to say i'm still too
[1:11:57] dumb to say but i can say what he said
[1:12:01] well how are you going to make these son
[1:12:02] of man when brother branham wasn't the
[1:12:04] son of man
[1:12:04] brother branham was a part of the body
[1:12:06] of christ he missed the message while
[1:12:07] ago
[1:12:08] brother brown was a part of the body of
[1:12:09] christ so then the whole body of christ
[1:12:12] including brother branham to put him at
[1:12:15] the apex of all understanding
[1:12:20] he's in the body of christ and if he
[1:12:23] physically set foot on earth
[1:12:25] he'd have two bodies
[1:12:30] in and out we got to go up
[1:12:33] to meet the body
[1:12:39] right then when we come back in the
[1:12:41] millennium
[1:12:45] we'll be coming with him
[1:12:49] that god may be all
[1:12:53] in all
[1:12:58] that's why she's the fullness of the
[1:12:59] godhead bodily but you don't believe the
[1:13:01] prophet
[1:13:03] i'm like a man talking to him on a
[1:13:04] telephone one day and he said
[1:13:06] i don't know he made some statement i
[1:13:08] don't know i said hang on a minute
[1:13:10] i'll get my computer running i'll show
[1:13:12] you where it's at
[1:13:19] do you believe the prophet
[1:13:24] that's a dumb question ain't too awfully
[1:13:27] dumb
[1:13:28] i asked a simple question do you believe
[1:13:30] the prophet
[1:13:33] you believe what he said
[1:13:37] do you believe that he said the bride
[1:13:39] would be the fullness of the godhead
[1:13:40] bodily do you believe that he said she
[1:13:41] would be the son of man
[1:13:44] who's going to raise the dead
[1:13:49] well now we got it figured out okay but
[1:13:51] just remember
[1:13:54] you got it figured out but just remember
[1:13:58] you ain't listening to when i say it
[1:14:01] brother random was in the body of christ
[1:14:06] the voice of the resurrection comes from
[1:14:08] the body of christ
[1:14:12] not a physical lord jesus
[1:14:15] so i put it all back together see you
[1:14:17] lost it
[1:14:19] because you didn't listen to want to say
[1:14:20] it you got your own ideas your thoughts
[1:14:27] see some of you never heard these things
[1:14:28] so you don't know
[1:14:30] but it's time to listen
[1:14:35] what are we going to do it's like i told
[1:14:37] them in the fellowship meeting the other
[1:14:38] day
[1:14:39] i said if we don't hurry up and get out
[1:14:40] of here we're gonna have fellowship
[1:14:41] meetings in the nursing home
[1:14:46] you know when you get there you get the
[1:14:49] nursing home
[1:14:52] you say something and everybody in the
[1:14:53] building all right man cause they don't
[1:14:55] even know what you're talking about
[1:14:56] they don't lost all their mind
[1:15:01] trying to get that tiredness off of you
[1:15:03] know sadness where
[1:15:05] you listen to what i'm saying for a
[1:15:08] second
[1:15:10] i believe he's right on time
[1:15:15] but i believe that there's got to be a
[1:15:18] people
[1:15:20] who can accept what the prophet has said
[1:15:23] and believe it
[1:15:26] and wait for god to reveal it
[1:15:29] what did he say we need a revelation
[1:15:31] more than anything
[1:15:32] did he say the bride would be waiting
[1:15:34] for the revelation of the rapture
[1:15:36] so evidently she don't have it until at
[1:15:40] a certain place she receives it
[1:15:42] that's what he said about page 14 of the
[1:15:44] rapture message
[1:15:46] he said the rapture is a revelation he
[1:15:47] said the bride be waiting for the
[1:15:50] revelation
[1:15:53] do you believe that you're actually
[1:15:55] experiencing
[1:15:56] now this is the last question do you
[1:15:59] believe you're actually experiencing
[1:16:02] the coming of the lord
[1:16:11] you're actually experiencing the coming
[1:16:12] of the lord
[1:16:15] see then we're not looking for up there
[1:16:25] i remember one time brother brandon made
[1:16:26] the statement i know what he talks about
[1:16:28] we'll get to it this afternoon
[1:16:29] not into just a half hour silence and
[1:16:31] all that but we getting into some
[1:16:33] thoughts this afternoon to talk about
[1:16:35] remember one time he said
[1:16:37] he said you know why heaven's gonna be
[1:16:38] silent let me remember this quote
[1:16:40] he's cause ain't no ain't gonna be
[1:16:42] nothing up there
[1:16:44] now that's paraphrasing it but it's
[1:16:46] close enough
[1:16:53] if a space if there's time
[1:16:56] in heaven of a half an hour everybody
[1:16:59] wants to know how long that is on earth
[1:17:01] what does it matter
[1:17:07] what does it matter how long
[1:17:11] the point is what's taking place
[1:17:19] right but if we don't realize it's
[1:17:22] taking place as i said in the days of
[1:17:23] martin luther
[1:17:24] he wasn't worried about it as long as
[1:17:26] luther was protesting the catholic
[1:17:27] church
[1:17:29] bother them but when the people
[1:17:33] begin to say i and my father are one
[1:17:36] i believe luther's message they got
[1:17:39] excited because they started losing a
[1:17:41] lot of their converts
[1:17:45] well i think it's at least time to say
[1:17:48] this is that
[1:17:49] amen amen
[1:17:52] i'm not looking for the coming of the
[1:17:53] lord i stopped that many years ago
[1:17:56] and i've told you about it it's on tape
[1:17:58] i don't have to worry about it
[1:17:59] i'm not looking for the coming of the
[1:18:01] lord i'm looking at the coming of the
[1:18:02] lord
[1:18:04] because the stage i'm talking about is
[1:18:05] not a physical
[1:18:07] it happened 2000 years ago and it's not
[1:18:10] a physical to happen when we come back
[1:18:11] in the millennium
[1:18:14] it's a spiritual happening through the
[1:18:17] opening of the word
[1:18:18] that has been delivered unto you and i
[1:18:20] that's right
[1:18:24] see if you ever see that one time and
[1:18:26] get down to the point of really seeing
[1:18:28] that this message is the descendant of
[1:18:30] god
[1:18:32] this message now not the messenger this
[1:18:35] message
[1:18:35] is the descendant of god
[1:18:38] and when you begin to see that you won't
[1:18:40] worry about guru's almanac and
[1:18:42] playboy magazines and and love story
[1:18:44] magazines and
[1:18:46] you won't even be concerned what the
[1:18:47] newspaper says
[1:18:53] you'll be concerned with what did the
[1:18:55] prophet say
[1:19:00] what did he say
[1:19:07] see we can read what he says and then
[1:19:08] put our own interpretations upon what he
[1:19:10] says
[1:19:12] and what good is it done
[1:19:20] but you see we can stay here and have
[1:19:22] stated and people oh yeah
[1:19:25] we've seen the dead raised on six
[1:19:34] occasions
[1:19:36] saw a man his eyes roll back he told me
[1:19:38] yesterday
[1:19:39] that when we got him to the doctor got
[1:19:41] him to the hospital at athens
[1:19:43] nothing's reasonable that his blood
[1:19:45] pressure was 50 over 40.
[1:19:50] he said if you hadn't talked to me all
[1:19:52] of that way
[1:19:54] he said i wouldn't be here today
[1:20:05] but you see it's because
[1:20:08] i believe he was dead but when i called
[1:20:12] his name
[1:20:16] he just rolled back around
[1:20:19] and looked
[1:20:23] there was no hopes of an emergency out
[1:20:25] there or whatever our phones wouldn't
[1:20:26] work
[1:20:28] i said wade let's go he drove the
[1:20:30] tractor on the back of his truck
[1:20:32] i had a four-wheeler sitting on the back
[1:20:35] of a truck
[1:20:36] pulling it with a trailer
[1:20:39] running 80 miles an hour
[1:20:42] to get a mad talking to him
[1:20:45] hollering at him randall don't go to
[1:20:48] sleep
[1:20:53] got him at the emergency room and they
[1:20:54] wasn't even there waiting on it you've
[1:20:55] heard me tell about it
[1:20:57] i called him and told him to have a man
[1:20:59] outside to pick him up cause his man
[1:21:00] with a possible heart attack
[1:21:02] and we believed he done died the lady
[1:21:05] said what are you doing i said i'm doing
[1:21:07] 80 miles an hour we'll send an ambulance
[1:21:08] i said lady i'll be there
[1:21:10] for your admirals cranks she said slow
[1:21:13] down i said
[1:21:14] slow down bring them in and be outside
[1:21:17] ready
[1:21:18] i got there they wouldn't nobody outside
[1:21:22] i went in screaming and hollering i
[1:21:25] apologize to him later but i said i'm
[1:21:27] apologizing for
[1:21:28] screaming and hollering about a man that
[1:21:29] you were supposed to be out there to
[1:21:31] take in a
[1:21:32] i had to get a security guard and me and
[1:21:34] him had to carry the man in the
[1:21:36] emergency room they wouldn't even come
[1:21:39] out
[1:21:39] before they come out in a minute
[1:21:40] apologizing when they seen what was
[1:21:42] going on
[1:21:45] i believe the man died his eyes rolled
[1:21:48] back everything was gone
[1:21:52] but god touched him we have other
[1:21:56] testimonies right here
[1:21:58] of the dead being raised
[1:22:01] but yet people don't want to believe
[1:22:03] that oh that was just a well
[1:22:05] he was just in a coma okay
[1:22:10] okay i don't have no problem
[1:22:14] i ain't trying to convince you
[1:22:18] i'm just telling what happened
[1:22:21] why can't we believe in the resurrection
[1:22:27] well it's on it now i quote big man
[1:22:31] third pull was only for brother branham
[1:22:34] and the lord jesus
[1:22:38] i can quote the man's name that said
[1:22:40] that some of you know it
[1:22:47] i thought your prophet said the third
[1:22:49] pool was
[1:22:51] for the bride
[1:22:54] and the church he said
[1:22:58] and to the totally lost
[1:23:03] now i thought it was even to the church
[1:23:11] amen but are we looking at the coming
[1:23:15] i've been looking at it for 40 something
[1:23:16] years been preaching about it for 40
[1:23:18] something years
[1:23:24] and i said then he's here
[1:23:30] but yet we're still looking for this to
[1:23:32] happen that to happen
[1:23:34] what has already happened
[1:23:39] well come on musicians
[1:23:43] what about it
[1:23:47] i titled the message because this is the
[1:23:49] series part is
[1:23:50] the coming of the lord part 5.
[1:23:58] and i titled it the coming
[1:24:03] the revealing of his word cause you tell
[1:24:05] me what the second coming of jesus
[1:24:07] christ is to be
[1:24:07] that's it come on i mean i'm i'm open
[1:24:11] i believe anything you name we'll put it
[1:24:13] in a reveal word i believe you said it
[1:24:18] anything you name is going to go to the
[1:24:20] revealing of the word
[1:24:22] so why not just start there
[1:24:28] come on church he said well this has got
[1:24:31] to happen this has got to happen
[1:24:34] it's not the word being revealed
[1:24:41] but what about it
[1:24:44] what are you looking for because
[1:24:48] as long as you keep looking for it
[1:24:50] you'll never say this is that
[1:24:53] as long as you keep looking for
[1:24:54] something you'll never admit it's here
[1:24:57] the very fact of you looking for it
[1:24:59] admits that you do not know what it is
[1:25:06] one of these days that means you're
[1:25:08] looking for it
[1:25:10] but you're looking out there this
[1:25:13] afternoon we're going to talk about the
[1:25:14] coming of the lord
[1:25:19] and i ask you to go home and look up the
[1:25:22] word c-o-m-e
[1:25:28] and see what it said i'm not going to
[1:25:31] ask for a raise of hands because 99
[1:25:33] of you didn't do it
[1:25:39] and yet i ask you to do it
[1:25:46] right well i know what it means
[1:25:50] what does it mean
[1:25:59] when jesus said unless you believe that
[1:26:00] i am he
[1:26:04] that was his coming
[1:26:12] even the world admits he came
[1:26:18] but what are you looking for
[1:26:22] the bible says because some of you won't
[1:26:24] be here this evening i mean i'm making
[1:26:25] this statement
[1:26:28] the bible says the end of all things has
[1:26:30] come upon us
[1:26:33] have you ever looked up the word end
[1:26:42] e-m-d
[1:26:48] now how many of you remember the quotes
[1:26:50] where the prophet said the seventh seal
[1:26:53] is the end of all things
[1:26:56] amen have you ever looked up the word
[1:27:02] e-n-d
[1:27:08] well you see you don't believe it
[1:27:11] if you believe that you'd look up the
[1:27:12] word come to see what i was talking
[1:27:14] about
[1:27:16] you believe it between the services
[1:27:18] today you'd look up the word end to see
[1:27:19] what it is
[1:27:22] what do you mean i know what it means
[1:27:26] you know what it means by your
[1:27:27] intellectual concept
[1:27:29] you do not know what it means by your
[1:27:31] spiritual revelation
[1:27:39] you're still looking at things and even
[1:27:40] a human being
[1:27:42] should be able to take the prophet's
[1:27:43] message we've had an english-speaking
[1:27:45] preacher
[1:27:46] right he didn't
[1:27:49] preach in theology he preached english
[1:27:53] take the english to see what he's
[1:27:54] talking about
[1:28:03] but i'm a hateful arrogant dody old
[1:28:06] granddaddy
[1:28:08] because i'm just stubborn enough to tell
[1:28:12] you
[1:28:14] you're not getting it
[1:28:22] if you're getting it you wouldn't miss a
[1:28:26] service
[1:28:34] i already know it it's like i told a
[1:28:37] brother when he told me he's leaving one
[1:28:39] day i said would you do me a favor
[1:28:41] he said well sure would what i said
[1:28:43] would you stay and listen to what i'm
[1:28:44] gonna preach this afternoon
[1:28:48] i said because you don't know what i'm
[1:28:50] talking about
[1:28:54] you don't think i know it i said i know
[1:28:56] you don't know it
[1:28:57] come on anybody with one eye nice sense
[1:28:59] or no he wouldn't walk out the door
[1:29:00] going home
[1:29:01] if he knows what i was talking about was
[1:29:03] the truth
[1:29:06] but i'm i'm sick i'm pity
[1:29:15] i got in trouble trying to explain six
[1:29:17] here
[1:29:18] i thought was supposed to come to church
[1:29:19] with sick now i didn't say when you got
[1:29:22] a 210 degree
[1:29:24] temperature and you land in a hospital

[1:34:54] what about it do you believe it
[1:35:00] you believe his coming is this message
[1:35:04] that is revealed to you
[1:35:07] if not what are you looking for
[1:35:12] you got to put it this evening women are
[1:35:15] all
[1:35:16] you can have the whole evening to
[1:35:17] explain what you're looking for
[1:35:22] because i'm not looking for nothing but
[1:35:24] the revealing of god's word
[1:35:27] and then a climax of that will be a
[1:35:29] manifestation
[1:35:34] there will be a change of these bodies
[1:35:37] but they're going to be here before we
[1:35:38] meet him in the air
[1:35:42] there's going to be a dead race right
[1:35:44] but it'll be done here
[1:35:46] there's going to be a gospel trumpet 10
[1:35:48] virgins the prophet said a
[1:35:50] gospel or something
[1:35:55] israel was gathered at the feast of the
[1:35:56] trumpets i thought we were supposed to
[1:35:59] be gathered
[1:36:06] i thought we were in the time of being
[1:36:07] caught away
[1:36:13] but if you're still looking for

[1:36:33] can't say that i'm playing around
[1:36:36] they can't say that i don't state what i
[1:36:37] believe
[1:36:39] because i've always tried to tell them
[1:36:41] about it
[1:36:43] i believe you're here with us as your
[1:36:45] prophet said outside of the corporal
[1:36:47] body
