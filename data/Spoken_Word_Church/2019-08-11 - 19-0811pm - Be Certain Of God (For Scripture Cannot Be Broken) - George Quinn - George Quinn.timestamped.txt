[32:57] she went and did according to the saying
[33:00] of Elijah and she and he and her house
[33:03] did eat many deaths and the barrel of

[34:25] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[34:27] and he closed the book and he given
[34:30] again to the minister and sat dine all
[34:32] the eyes of them that were in the
[34:34] synagogue were fastened on him and he
[34:36] began to say unto them this day is this
[34:40] scripture fulfilled in your ears amen on
[34:44] our last little reading
[34:45] I'm sure the brothers again will
[34:47] probably get there before I do but
[34:48] you'll see it up there it's in John's
[34:50] Gospel praise God because this is hard
[34:52] I'm gonna link it all in today amen and
[34:55] John's Gospel tonight we know we're very
[34:57] familiar with John chapter 10 so you
[34:59] might be thinking I'm gonna preach about
[35:00] the Good Shepherd holding some wonderful
[35:01] message if I did but I'm not a man for
[35:05] his God so we're gonna read away by at
[35:08] the end toward the end of it
[35:09] hallelujah and I'll cut in here and
[35:12] verse 34 you could read more if you
[35:13] wanted but time being time he said jesus
[35:16] answered them is it not written in your
[35:19] law I said year gods and if he called
[35:22] them gods unto whom the Word of God came
[35:25] and the scripture cannot be broken say
[35:31] ye of him whom the father have
[35:32] sanctified and sent into the world thou
[35:34] blasphemous because I said I am the son
[35:37] of God if I do not the works of my
[35:39] father believe me not but if I do though
[35:42] ye believe not me believe the works that
[35:44] you may know and believe that the father
[35:47] is in me and I in him amen and the Lord
[35:51] out his blessing to the reading of his
[35:54] were to let us just have a short prayer
[35:56] Christmas Lord we thank you Lord as we
[35:59] stepped over to this pulpit we could
[36:02] feel the pulsating power of the Holy
[36:04] Ghost and we pray Lord as the people are
[36:07] anticipation of the word Lord that you
[36:10] will meet their anticipation not a mine
[36:12] Lord put me aside use my lips use my
[36:16] voice is my thoughts use everything
[36:17] about us Lord because we surrender all
[36:20] to you and Lord we pray that
[36:22] we'll go to this house blessed in our
[36:24] soul today and we ask it in Jesus
[36:26] Christ's name Amen amen and you may be
[36:30] seated
[36:30] prison or hallelujah many things you
[36:34] could say praise God many things you
[36:36] could say and I've often thought about
[36:38] it that if you've got an hour it's just
[36:41] coming on 222 nine just before if you've
[36:44] got an R to say something no matter how
[36:45] you say it or who says it you can only
[36:47] get so many words in as they're so many
[36:50] so so therefore pretty Scott there's
[36:52] many thoughts you have to Levite and
[36:54] things say and I think brother Joe can
[36:56] fly shop there that the family that I
[36:58] was telling you about this morning in
[37:00] India if he condor might just come up in
[37:02] a moment and yes there this that's that
[37:05] moment unheard three daughters and her
[37:08] son was on the other side
[37:09] that's so when i was talking to you but
[37:11] that got converted to Jesus Christ over
[37:14] in India and November and I'm so glad
[37:17] and I will be going to their village
[37:18] again this year and I've never been to
[37:21] it before but when I go back I I hope I
[37:24] hope that if they haven't been baptized
[37:26] they'll be there to be baptized in the
[37:28] name of Jesus Christ I really do
[37:30] hallelujah amen
[37:32] it's nice to have a sweet tooth if
[37:34] anybody told you they don't have a sweet
[37:35] tooth you really wouldn't believe them
[37:36] with you hey man I pop up in cars well I
[37:41] shouldn't even say the southern Virginia
[37:42] I was in brother Ronald slice and he
[37:46] made the coffee because he knows I like
[37:47] coffee and and he had one of these what
[37:50] is it crispy crossed across Krispy Kreme
[37:54] Doughnuts
[37:54] and he had a box of them and so he said
[37:57] would you like would you like a donut I
[37:59] and sister Connie said brother George
[38:02] might wanna do not you know and I said I
[38:04] don't really mind you know and no one
[38:06] said oh I don't know you know that's
[38:08] okay
[38:08] so she said is that okay I said yes
[38:11] right so we had the coffee in the donut
[38:13] and Ronald turned her and he said the
[38:15] economy if I was as thin as home he said
[38:17] I'd eat the whole box
[38:21] well I don't nobody eating the whole box
[38:23] brother Wade you know I don't know who
[38:26] that but we do have a sweet tooth you
[38:27] know but the Bible says thy word was
[38:30] sweet on to mightiest the Word of God is
[38:33] so sweet - artists it's not hard to eat
[38:36] it it's not hard to absorb it as a
[38:38] blessing to our soul to our body to our
[38:41] spirit and we thank God for it
[38:43] no uh you know we all have favorite
[38:46] messages that brother Branham preached
[38:47] amen
[38:48] and I went back from the way at the
[38:49] beginning amen I like that message to be
[38:52] certain of God because you know really
[38:55] and truly we all want to be certain of
[38:56] God you know and brother Branham says
[38:59] that a prison Lord he said you know but
[39:02] God's people are always been in a
[39:03] minority and that's true all through you
[39:06] know when you got all the prophets of
[39:08] veal you only got one Elijah to face
[39:09] them up it's always been in a minority
[39:12] no matter what were you go why you do it
[39:14] and and he said that's the way that's
[39:16] the way it is amen and praise the Lord
[39:18] but they're still God's chosen and
[39:20] elected people amen and so we're
[39:23] thankful for that but he also goes on to
[39:25] say this ain't this was 1959 the quotes
[39:28] that I'm gonna give you before I changed
[39:30] the order of the service but he meant
[39:32] but it's a strange thing to me said how
[39:35] people that have accepted Christ is
[39:37] afraid to trust him I thought that there
[39:41] may be something that they're not sure
[39:42] of and not remained at me of the man
[39:44] that went across the Niagara Falls and
[39:46] they all watched him who if he falls
[39:49] he's dead and all that and he took over
[39:51] a wheel but of course he took off the
[39:52] rubber a man and he walked across the
[39:55] iron cable and he said to them this
[39:57] fella on the other side do you believe I
[39:59] could go back again
[40:00] he said yeah cuz thing you're doing of
[40:02] watching him do it twice and he said
[40:03] would you get into the wheel bar I let
[40:05] me with your over and he said no no you
[40:10] see so it's one thing to to trust and
[40:13] it's another thing to trust really trust
[40:15] amen where you are certain what I want
[40:19] to get the builders say Amen praise God
[40:21] and so he said that that that we would
[40:24] trust in the Lord Amen and I'd be
[40:27] certain that it's God that he said it
[40:30] he'll back it up amen
[40:31] so prison the Lord when we read
[40:33] Tony amen and you know I'm not going to
[40:36] preach all of that message I'm just
[40:39] going to highlights of it and he's
[40:41] talking about not that morning this is
[40:43] what I'm saying about a vision that in
[40:45] my life I can sit down and look at that
[40:47] morning see the morning see seinen are
[40:50] not bald the gate of the city a little
[40:53] tired not a big massive city a man like
[40:56] Galante just a small little almost like
[40:58] have the leads and there I can see this
[41:01] little woman brother Samuel could Christ
[41:03] over you know poor not very well dressed
[41:06] you know hungry then a month's appear
[41:09] because she had been a starvation
[41:13] situation amen that famine was on and
[41:17] you can just see her there and he said
[41:20] why was that why was that all the
[41:24] problems and I would say this sincerely
[41:26] with all my heart that sometimes people
[41:29] blame God they blame God it's God's
[41:32] fault for everything
[41:33] amen but it's not God's fault it's mom's
[41:36] fault it's mine it gets away even when
[41:39] you look and I'm not gonna preach in it
[41:41] even when you look at when they went
[41:43] into the Promised Land God said I'll
[41:45] Drive the might amen
[41:47] before you but they still let them stay
[41:50] in the lines where he said tell them all
[41:52] but they didn't and before you know what
[41:55] they're living together and before you
[41:56] know what Israel is worshiping the gods
[41:58] of the killer nights so that wasn't
[42:00] God's fault
[42:01] he said I'll do it if you believe it
[42:03] amen so praise God that's the way it is
[42:05] and here they were the moral decay of
[42:08] the mission and brother Branham said
[42:11] ezreal was loved by God and when they
[42:14] got rid of the will of God the enemy
[42:16] took them over and they shouldn't do it
[42:18] so God loves his church but when they
[42:21] got hurt of the will of God and the
[42:22] denominations and then I see a car so
[42:24] they're walking away they're walking
[42:26] away from the truth they're walking away
[42:28] from the word and what's it going to
[42:30] bring judgment that's all it can bring
[42:31] hallelujah and Ahab was a king of Israel
[42:35] at the time and they might thinking he
[42:36] was the most wicked King a brother
[42:39] Branham says that it's true that Israel
[42:41] ever had because he married an idolater
[42:43] right in the face and frontage of God
[42:45] saying well I'm going to have this
[42:47] woman because iiiii like her I don't
[42:51] wouldn't say he loved her but he said I
[42:53] like her and she's a pretty and all that
[42:54] I never mentioned that she is an idol
[42:58] worshiper that she's gonna worship bill
[43:00] and she's gonna introduce bill to the
[43:02] people and my so that's what brought the
[43:05] moral decay onto the mission because
[43:08] brother Branham said that this is what
[43:10] the people this is what the people do
[43:11] amen if if the King does it would end
[43:14] the people follow it
[43:15] amen so pretty god hallelujah will if
[43:18] you want to follow anything if you want
[43:20] an example of anything praise the Lord
[43:23] follow your postures example if you want
[43:25] to follow on in follow brother branham's
[43:26] example how he lived
[43:28] you say I want to live like that you'll
[43:30] not be far off the mark I can tell you
[43:31] that you'll not be far of the mark amen
[43:33] and so praise the Lord you know and he
[43:37] led the country and a idolatry and you
[43:39] know that story very quickly I put a
[43:42] burden a birth one day he said well I'd
[43:44] like to have more than I've got so
[43:47] here's a nice vineyard I think I'll have
[43:48] it an even turn in a bark and he takes
[43:51] out his billfold he says how much do you
[43:52] want for urine hurt ins a neighbor said
[43:54] I can't sell you miners he said no no no
[43:57] I'm gonna borrow give you a good price
[43:58] he said you don't understand mr. King he
[44:00] said I can't sell that in hurtings I'm a
[44:03] man and what happened was he went he
[44:05] went away sorrowful and there he goes up
[44:09] and he's sitting there make a big
[44:10] spoiled baby and his palace and Jezebel
[44:13] come said what's wrong with you know
[44:15] they both certainly took me dirty
[44:17] wouldn't sell me as it hurts you know
[44:19] you're the king of Israel
[44:21] he said you leave it with me I'll get it
[44:22] and she did she got it all right praise
[44:24] God
[44:25] she got it all right amen and false
[44:27] witnesses the pernais boss was stoned
[44:29] and he got the inheritance but that's
[44:32] when the Prophet turned up and said thus
[44:34] saith the Lord hallelujah because you've
[44:37] done that the dogs will drink your blood
[44:38] they'll say they lick your blood up
[44:41] hallelujah and she was judged as well
[44:43] amen amen they threw her out of the
[44:47] window
[44:48] praise God so you can't do that folks
[44:50] amen you just can't do that Prince the
[44:53] Lord under and get away with it amen and
[44:56] so a brother Branham said that that's a
[44:58] picture of our country
[45:00] he's talking about America but I'm
[45:02] telling you the picture of every country
[45:03] Amen hallelujah like I said today open
[45:07] Canada to talking about dog having more
[45:09] rights but our our our Prime Minister we
[45:13] call him t-shirt here
[45:14] SJ openly gay and he's smart until
[45:17] northern mine died because they brought
[45:19] in the law and young people in Ireland
[45:22] they just say well you know we don't
[45:24] care if you want to do not go ahead you
[45:26] know whether they believe it or not some
[45:28] of them believe it
[45:29] many of them don't but did you say live
[45:31] and let live and all that so it was
[45:33] voted in but when he went to Canada he
[45:36] was not going to take his partner with
[45:37] him but the Trudeau the young Trudeau
[45:41] he said bring your partner it's okay
[45:44] your Marty to him it's alright I'm there
[45:47] in the state banquets and all up in
[45:48] Canada and the Irish flag that can hit
[45:50] him flagged all starting there there's
[45:52] this partner it beside him just right
[45:54] open now when you get it open like that
[45:56] hallelujah I tell you what praise God
[45:59] I even if you even if he read Romans 1 I
[46:03] don't think I'm doing any good
[46:05] amen so you know it's a picture of our
[46:08] land as well as America amen hard hard
[46:11] we will get into the situation we are
[46:13] and it's no surprise to us that religion
[46:17] is on the decline and it will keep going
[46:18] that way
[46:19] amen and you'll see more and more as you
[46:22] go on Souls in prison you will see them
[46:24] they'll be there and they will not get
[46:25] right amen they've made their their
[46:27] final decisions so brother brother said
[46:30] whatever you put before God
[46:31] it's an idol amen let it be whatever it
[46:34] is maybe and remember he was great when
[46:38] he was not a Christian
[46:39] he used to polished in a Sunday he used
[46:41] to polish this a car till it was
[46:43] literally polished away he loved that
[46:45] that was his idol he didn't realize it
[46:47] but that was his idol
[46:48] hallelujah and then when he got to
[46:51] himself later on he said my imagine do
[46:53] not much impulsive every year
[46:56] what about 20 years from now if you
[46:59] could go back 20 years and see what you
[47:00] drove and you heard it the day well you
[47:03] would have almost like a heap of junk
[47:05] that's so it's not a very good angle
[47:08] Amen I was telling the folks that over
[47:11] and
[47:12] they and their big football stadium
[47:16] there's one one club in England and
[47:19] they've got it's called Chelsea's the
[47:21] area and the football club there and
[47:24] they said Chelsea is our religion and I
[47:27] said well it's not I told my people are
[47:29] citizens a very pure religion very pure
[47:31] religion because of you ER and the ICU
[47:34] Amy and since L sees my religion ain't
[47:36] gonna help you one iota you are gonna
[47:39] need a living God you are gonna need
[47:41] someone who can preach and pray the
[47:44] prayer of faith for you I said you're
[47:46] gonna need not not just that I'm gonna
[47:48] do nothing for you
[47:49] praise God so anything you put before
[47:52] God is an idol amen and you know grit
[47:55] material things don't always rest in the
[47:57] will of God if God gives you them he can
[47:59] trust you with them no right but they
[48:00] don't they don't prove you know if
[48:02] you've got three Cadillacs or for them
[48:03] don't prove that you're a better
[48:04] Christian than anybody else praise God
[48:06] somebody has to take the public
[48:08] transport don't prove nothing
[48:09] amen Prince God so amen and you know
[48:12] brother Joe he likes this kind of thing
[48:14] maybe you'll take this one down put it
[48:16] somewhere I don't know but he said what
[48:18] we need today is not a lot a lot of
[48:20] material things we have that he said
[48:23] what we needed is be more spiritual amen
[48:26] more spiritual praise God and that's
[48:27] what we need today to spend more time
[48:29] with the Lord and to be more spiritual
[48:31] that our main thing on spiritual things
[48:33] the spiritual mind and the spiritual
[48:37] mind has attracted to God can't help it
[48:40] hallelujah is just attracted to God you
[48:42] know you don't say oh I better eat my
[48:44] Bible why because it could always read
[48:45] my Bible make every day know it's
[48:47] attracting you to get something out of
[48:49] it like a honey bee you know the honey's
[48:51] there
[48:51] you want something you want God to speak
[48:53] to you want something to be done
[48:55] hallelujah and so Prince the Lord we
[48:57] need to be spirit soul amen it probably
[49:00] looked this one up he can do because
[49:01] it's there and we need to be spirit so
[49:04] as a person that will humble themselves
[49:06] so spritzel and humble and you don't
[49:10] press
[49:10] have you ever get someone standing up
[49:12] and saying I've got a testimony I'm so
[49:14] humble
[49:14] you know don't believe them
[49:17] don't believe them because you don't
[49:19] you're not going to say that humility
[49:21] and something that works certain your
[49:23] life what people would say that's a
[49:24] homeless in there but you don't preach
[49:26] it because they'll say well that's
[49:28] afraid to say that then your humble just
[49:31] think you know what I mean don't ya and
[49:34] then he says praise God and he says a
[49:36] person that will humble themselves
[49:38] before God even if they haven't a penny
[49:41] and we'll pray we'll pray you gotta pray
[49:46] hallelujah say brother George I don't
[49:48] have much time
[49:49] look if you're stopped at the traffic
[49:51] light hallelujah if you're having your
[49:52] coffee break I know one brother brother
[49:55] uh Samuel was learned in the factory in
[49:58] the Chevrolet we Pike years ago and they
[50:00] used to get together with their bricks
[50:01] and everything they got and pray and
[50:03] read the scriptures not right
[50:04] you saw a brother taking your mom
[50:06] dimness Prince God's Way just did not
[50:08] got together the different brothers that
[50:10] were there and not that factory hey man
[50:12] you can pray you can make a place to
[50:14] pray hallelujah and it doesn't have to
[50:17] be many long prayers
[50:18] could you imagine when Peter was sinking
[50:20] you'd say now what I think what should I
[50:23] pray here and he's sinking in the water
[50:25] yeah yeah maybe it was you know but he
[50:31] cried out he said lord save me hey man
[50:34] that's all he needed to do say pray
[50:37] until the spirit within them is
[50:40] satisfied with the goodness of God of
[50:44] all the things that I'm satisfied with
[50:46] it's the goodness of God and you gotta
[50:49] believe to see that in the land of the
[50:52] living and then he says a revival takes
[50:55] place and said your heart amen
[50:58] that little spring is welling up within
[51:00] you and it's bubbling away and it can't
[51:03] be suppressed it'll keep bubbling up
[51:04] every day buh buh buh buh buh buh I'm
[51:06] not little revival will take place in
[51:09] your heart and in your life and said
[51:12] your heart
[51:12] I'm not changes your attitude and that
[51:15] changes your atmosphere and I believe
[51:17] that praise God that your atmosphere is
[51:19] everything that you take with you amen
[51:22] and live in that atmosphere every day so
[51:25] here we are
[51:25] amen God will never be pleased I'd say
[51:28] an entire sanctified
[51:30] before heaven amen and so that's it when
[51:33] it's cleaned but you know it's cleaned
[51:36] it's emptied it separately under God but
[51:38] you still need that Holy Spirit to come
[51:40] and you still need that new birth amen
[51:42] that you've got that Nitzer that devayne
[51:45] heavenly Nitzer in you amen and in me
[51:48] hallelujah praise God and that's what we
[51:50] want this little woman she had to be of
[51:53] the same caliber as Elijah because
[51:55] usually Direction shows what you are
[51:58] it's not true because you know your
[52:00] actions speak louder than your words
[52:01] they really do so I'd rather see someone
[52:05] act then talk a lot amen
[52:07] praise God you could almost get in a
[52:10] joke of a Texas there but I'll leave
[52:12] that I think you could follow that as
[52:16] well but anyway and she must have been
[52:20] of the same caliber because usually your
[52:22] action speaks again what shows what you
[52:24] are and she was chosen to entertain
[52:27] God's prophet remember she was a Gentile
[52:30] not Jew and the line was burning up no
[52:33] dirt this little woman bit of that
[52:34] caliber like a believer type 4 we see
[52:37] that God would not have called her if
[52:39] she hadn't have been worthy hallelujah
[52:41] and she had not been worthy to entertain
[52:43] one of his prophets praise God he would
[52:46] never have sent its profit to a house
[52:48] that was unworthy but she was worthy
[52:51] hallelujah and you are worthy because he
[52:54] comes to your house every day hallelujah
[52:57] every day every minute of every day he's
[52:59] with you in your house a man and why
[53:02] because he's proved that you're worthy
[53:04] he's got confidence in you amen and he's
[53:07] there hallelujah and that's a wonderful
[53:09] thing amen and and surely amen it wasn't
[53:13] Elijah's he only had the vision it
[53:16] wasn't his thinking or even choosing
[53:18] perhaps but it was God's choosing it
[53:21] wasn't him or harboring him it was God
[53:24] bidding him and he had placed by the
[53:26] brook it had fed the Ravens but it dried
[53:29] up and then God says go darling for I
[53:32] have commanded a widow woman to feed you
[53:35] I'd love to know heart God commanded her
[53:37] to do that but he did come on her to do
[53:39] that amen hallelujah and so we're so
[53:41] thankful for that not today this little
[53:44] story amen and God surely went to a
[53:46] believer of the same nature as Elijah
[53:50] brother Samuel said builder even in her
[53:52] we were talking and some what is with
[53:54] her he said dude there's things that we
[53:56] believe the same as brother branham even
[53:58] before we knew the message because God
[54:00] was in us the god of brother Branham was
[54:02] in us we were of the same nature
[54:03] hallelujah we are still to this day
[54:05] hallelujah he doesn't speak in tongues
[54:08] to us we know what he's saying amen
[54:10] and so thank God for that hallelujah the
[54:12] same nature as Elijah amen and please
[54:17] God I want to give into this little
[54:19] things cuz you're a little few nuggets
[54:20] here that I wanna before it changed the
[54:22] course of the of the message amen and he
[54:25] said perhaps she prayed all night long I
[54:27] and she she could take look at the pale
[54:30] lips of her little boy about three or
[54:33] four years old and she could see her own
[54:35] bones don't know where's the flesh was
[54:37] gonna off them and it must have been a
[54:39] terrible thing as that as her mother I
[54:41] seen this good on and yet her hands
[54:44] before God pray night and day Amen
[54:46] hallelujah and we're down to one handful
[54:50] of mail on a spoonful of oil you know I
[54:52] think somewhere that brother brother
[54:54] brother said when you get to the end of
[54:56] your rope just tie a knot and hold on
[54:58] that's a good idea
[54:59] just hold on don't give up don't give up
[55:02] if God said it
[55:03] it'll happen and I'll show you why these
[55:05] things happen well you know there's
[55:08] wouldn't you get really to know the
[55:10] nature of God you know you find it he's
[55:11] a person Jesus Christ is a person he was
[55:14] here on the earth he knows what you need
[55:17] amen
[55:18] could you imagine coming to your door if
[55:20] someone said you and a half are the lord
[55:23] of the coming to your door and Jesus
[55:24] himself appeared amen and you invaded a
[55:27] man and he said Sternin your home
[55:29] amen and he's sitting there and you're
[55:33] saying the Lord but would you like
[55:34] something to drink or what and he sure
[55:36] sure whatever you're sharing with him
[55:38] and then he may turn around do you say
[55:40] no you were praying last night and this
[55:42] is what you asked for and he'll tell you
[55:44] what you ask for
[55:44] oh brother I'll tell you wouldn't be
[55:46] beautiful gonna be wonderful hallelujah
[55:48] and he was set you read and when he left
[55:51] I'll tell you you'd be more than ten
[55:52] foot time you would be Wow hallelujah
[55:56] Oh nobody could touch you a man so here
[55:58] she was and amen
[56:01] he said you know it's a strange thing
[56:04] it's a strange thing praise God that the
[56:07] Lord does that amen and amen
[56:11] most streams that sometimes that God
[56:15] does it that way that he just tries you
[56:19] rate down to the end what's the next
[56:21] stop Lennie death death oh but you said
[56:25] there that you told the family that God
[56:27] would give you a dream or whatever way
[56:28] that he was going to sell a property to
[56:30] you I did but if that profit don't come
[56:32] I'm dead it's as simple as that
[56:34] amen and she was just looking to see
[56:37] what was going to happen I'm just
[56:39] willing praise God and so he said God
[56:41] likes to do it sometime like that you
[56:43] know when you've confessed your sin and
[56:45] unmet every requirement of God you
[56:48] believe in God the circumstances had
[56:49] been met that's according to as well
[56:51] you've confessed her sins and we've all
[56:53] made wrongs that we that we did okay you
[56:55] make it right and every requirement and
[56:57] yet he still is silent oh my it seems
[57:02] that he's not answering your prayer you
[57:04] know sometimes we pray for years and
[57:06] years for our prayer to be answered amen
[57:09] that's why we must never give up folks
[57:11] because when the angel Gabriel I love
[57:14] this when the angel Gabriel appeared to
[57:16] Zechariah in the temple the first thing
[57:18] he said to him was thy prayer is heard
[57:21] and Zachariah didn't know what he was
[57:23] talking about no you don't you're gonna
[57:27] I would say oh no no it couldn't be that
[57:28] prayers are you doing it whoever you are
[57:30] you tuned him I fasted my wife's boss
[57:33] said no no no I didn't say that I said
[57:35] your prayer has heard when he planted
[57:38] somewhere years back God heard it and
[57:40] now here was the fulfillment of the
[57:43] prayer hallelujah that is wonderful amen
[57:46] God likes to do that hallelujah amen and
[57:49] I here you are and you've met every
[57:52] requirement and he still won't move he
[57:56] seems to be silent he said that is when
[57:59] you've got to be sure of God you've got
[58:01] to be sure yes God said it hallelujah
[58:05] mine you know I was listening to DL
[58:07] moody and not listen to the deal middle
[58:10] Paco's reading about the element hey man
[58:12] praise God he didn't make many CDs but
[58:16] but but when he was dying and he's gone
[58:20] in another dimension and seeing people
[58:21] and all out there and his daughter said
[58:23] or dad's you know your daydreamin he
[58:26] said I'm not ready man said it's real
[58:28] hallelujah this is my coronation day
[58:31] this is mother paulie's here's a priest
[58:34] this is my coronation day and it was
[58:37] hallelujah you know my you know with
[58:40] Charles hundun Spurgeon died and he said
[58:44] a lovely thing he said don't and the day
[58:46] of Charles Darwin Spurgeon said don't
[58:49] try to fit the Bible to fit the inch and
[58:54] they tried to do that the Catholic
[58:56] Church says oh they were scientists must
[58:57] be right we must have been all evolved
[59:00] from a frog or something God whatever
[59:02] you know some kind of what the Catholic
[59:05] Church went along with it
[59:06] run along with darlin hope Darwin said
[59:08] it everybody believes it what must be
[59:09] true
[59:09] I'll tell you one thing charge silent
[59:12] Spurgeon didn't say that he fought at
[59:14] hallelujah and he said don't you try to
[59:16] to fit the Bible to the edge he said you
[59:19] fit the edge to the Bible and that's why
[59:21] we know where we're up today because we
[59:22] affinity ears to the Bible to God's Word
[59:25] that makes more sense doesn't not amen
[59:27] and so Prince God hallelujah amen and he
[59:31] said when he he won't move it seems he
[59:34] sat silent that's when you got to be
[59:36] sure he's God he said don't be
[59:38] discouraged the only thing to do is that
[59:41] in your heart you know be certain of God
[59:44] hallelujah amen
[59:45] and he says make that text when you
[59:48] don't ever even met everything you're
[59:50] sure he's God he said that's when faith
[59:53] kicks in my God has declared in his word
[59:56] decreed in his word that as by faith you
[1:00:00] get everything I mean you know if you go
[1:00:03] into the gas station and of course I
[1:00:05] have to do it and money you probably do
[1:00:08] it with your card but the thing is you
[1:00:10] know you pay the price
[1:00:11] hallelujah and that's the currency
[1:00:13] that's what you pay in truth God amen
[1:00:16] your own currency
[1:00:17] well the currency of heaven is faith if
[1:00:20] you're going to get anything by faith
[1:00:22] you'll get it
[1:00:23] that's right I'm telling you that is
[1:00:25] right hallelujah praise God and that's
[1:00:28] that's been decreed by God
[1:00:30] for my faith that you see if that by
[1:00:33] grace you see it through faith and
[1:00:35] that's not even of yourself it's a gift
[1:00:37] of God hallelujah so amen that's when
[1:00:40] Fiat kicks in right there when you're
[1:00:42] just it's like jube amen and and he
[1:00:45] furthered his friends weren't his
[1:00:46] friends and trying to condemn him
[1:00:48] instead of putting her arm and saying
[1:00:49] look god bless you amen
[1:00:51] oh no praise the Lord and so here they
[1:00:53] were amen and just when his faith kicked
[1:00:57] in and he saw that vision hallelujah all

[1:01:02] don't care how long do you wait honey

[1:01:24] faith praise the Lord
[1:01:27] he's not testing your billfold he's
[1:01:29] testing your faith praise God and and
[1:01:32] you know the Prophet said he loves to do
[1:01:34] that because he's a God feel he believed
[1:01:38] its own word let there be light and
[1:01:39] there was they believed this that there

[1:03:59] place you tell me what to eat that's how
[1:04:02] much confidence I've got on him because
[1:04:04] I know he knows better than I do
[1:04:05] praise God amen and so praise the Lord
[1:04:09] he were coming and I said to my wife I'm
[1:04:11] looking in this shop and I said let's go

[1:16:39] missionary College and I spent a good 18
[1:16:41] months and not college two years with
[1:16:43] her and and I cut my heart prepared for
[1:16:47] the mission fail but we used to have
[1:16:48] missionaries coming in from all over the
[1:16:49] place you know all George didn't make a
[1:16:51] grid a grid search planter open they're
[1:16:54] open Peru and the questions and all and
[1:16:56] all right okay that'd be nice you know
[1:16:58] and you know there was one thing that
[1:17:01] God fought me on and that was India that
[1:17:03] was India prince of all princes India
[1:17:05] boy I just hid it in there you know I
[1:17:08] wasn't going to go to India no Lord I'll
[1:17:10] go anywhere on up but not India don't

[1:17:16] what I'm saying
[1:17:16] the thing that they're holding on to is
[1:17:18] the thing he's just sent her but that's
[1:17:20] what I'm asking you do but Lord they're
[1:17:22] so dirty and poor and you know I don't
[1:17:24] want to go there he said that's what I'm
[1:17:26] asking you do and so I fought not it for
[1:17:29] a long time and then when I came to my
[1:17:31] surrender day at that point he said I
[1:17:34] don't want you to go to India but you
[1:17:36] must be prepared to go anywhere where I
[1:17:39] send you that's the whole key say that's
[1:17:41] exactly right brother Samuel is it not
[1:17:43] amen hallelujah I'm so pretty bad amen
[1:17:46] you know the story you know the story of

[1:17:56] of that alarm and it was his eyes and he
[1:17:58] I love that little story Prince God it's
[1:18:01] just a little story and in fact it may
[1:18:03] not be you know but it's such a lovely
[1:18:05] little story that it could really
[1:18:07] would be in fact and so here he had this
[1:18:09] little arm trained to lead him ride and
[1:18:11] it was great and and he had a couple of
[1:18:14] little turtle doves and he was playing
[1:18:15] from birth and a little line with Lydia
[1:18:17] and Wow
[1:18:20] his daughter got sick and he said Lord
[1:18:23] of your healer I'll give you these two
[1:18:24] long at least three two dove so she was
[1:18:26] healed and he offered the two doves and
[1:18:29] sacrificed to God and then somebody else
[1:18:31] gets sick real sick real pardon to Diane
[1:18:33] and the family and he said Lord he said
[1:18:37] if you heal I think it may have been his
[1:18:40] daughter I'm not sure he said in the
[1:18:42] book but he said if you healed my
[1:18:43] daughter he said I'll give you the slap
[1:18:45] my my my and you know his daughter was
[1:18:49] healed and he's there and he's blind

[1:18:58] you gonna do and he said I promise I'm
[1:19:02] gonna do it all God loves that God loves
[1:19:04] you to keep your promise
[1:19:05] because he'll keep his yes sir and so
[1:19:08] he's gone up to the temple planed and
[1:19:11] this little arm leading him up to the
[1:19:12] temple he meets a priest and the priest
[1:19:14] says we're ghosts I bought a Miss or a
[1:19:16] priest I'm going up to the temple to

[1:19:26] I'll buy your lamb it'll need all the
[1:19:28] Lord's conditions and go ahead and
[1:19:30] sacrifice that and the Lord lets out
[1:19:32] that I'm sure it'd be wonderful he said
[1:19:34] mr. priest thank you appreciate that he
[1:19:36] said but I didn't promise God any other
[1:19:38] alarm he said I promised him the slap he
[1:19:42] said but that's your eyes he said I
[1:19:44] promised him this loud and so there was

[1:19:50] thinking about how he was going to get
[1:19:51] home and here he is hallelujah offers
[1:19:54] his little lamb and on the way home
[1:19:57] hallelujah what does he mean he meets
[1:19:59] the Lamb of God

[1:23:29] singing here today if I ask him what is
[1:23:31] the chemical of water probably they'll
[1:23:34] know it what it is but the chemical
[1:23:36] makeup of water is hitched to all three
[1:23:39] parts hydrogen one part oxygen makes

[1:24:32] take god I just worked No hallelujah
[1:24:34] listen just take him at his word be
[1:24:37] certain of God why why because thus said
[1:24:42] the Lord and scripture on Scripture has
[1:24:46] thus said the Lord the Word of God
[1:24:48] hallelujah 9 when we read when we read
[1:24:53] John and we saw that Jesus said about
[1:24:56] their law that you were gods we believe
[1:24:59] that Moses was God to them and brother
[1:25:01] branham was good to us but he spoke lost
[1:25:03] at the Lord hallelujah amen and so
[1:25:06] praise God he called them gods and from
[1:25:09] the word came to and the scripture
[1:25:12] cannot be broken
[1:25:14] now that is there that's the the fern
[1:25:17] ition we are not built on earth
[1:25:19] uh-uh-uh-uh-uh where it says a
[1:25:21] bottomless pit because it ain't got a
[1:25:24] foundation but we stand sure the word of
[1:25:28] the Lord is sure and it's a sure
[1:25:30] foundation and we can stand on it why
[1:25:33] because it can't be broken oh my would
[1:25:38] you like some more life ok I don't know
[1:25:41] yeah it can't be broken
[1:25:42] praise God you know it's on maintained
[1:25:45] and they came to where Jesus was they
[1:25:47] saw that he was dead already
[1:25:48] and they Britt not his legs but one of
[1:25:51] the soldiers with a spear pierced the
[1:25:53] side amen and forth with Kim right blood
[1:25:57] and water and he saw he that saw a
[1:26:01] record and his record is true and he
[1:26:04] knew it what he says is true that
[1:26:06] gimmick belief for these things were
[1:26:08] done that the scripture should be
[1:26:10] fulfilled not a bone and his body would
[1:26:15] not be broken and brother Branham I've
[1:26:17] got another quote later on and that's
[1:26:19] the way I did my business back to front
[1:26:21] I mean I should be quoting in this next
[1:26:24] quote nigh but later on where he says
[1:26:27] that the hand of God stabbed that drunk

[1:43:52] attraction on the mind what was he doing
[1:43:54] he was four full in Scripture
[1:43:57] why was he for full in Scripture because
[1:43:59] scripture cannot be broken
[1:44:01] it said behold your king come with lowly
[1:44:05] on the fall of an ass amen behold your
[1:44:09] king and they didn't see it
[1:44:13] but I'll tell you what some saw it and
[1:44:16] scripture was fulfilled because it can't
[1:44:19] be broken you take any strips I'm
[1:44:21] telling you you take any promise and you
[1:44:24] can read after it scripture cannot be
[1:44:27] broken anyone you killed arrayed a men
[1:44:30] look look look
[1:44:31] well maybe I'll touch that I mean look
[1:44:33] what he says they men when we read it
[1:44:35] and look today is this scripture
[1:44:38] fulfilled that was wearing there to be
[1:44:41] filled amen
[1:44:43] and what happens when brother Branham
[1:44:45] was printed and Burton's a man that the
[1:44:47] world could not take another birth pian
[1:44:49] and it cannot do it
[1:44:51] hallelujah and and he couldn't find the
[1:44:54] place and the Catholic priest whenever a
[1:44:57] bishop came out and give us the Bible
[1:44:59] and he read that scripture because it
[1:45:01] was blurred like stuck together just the
[1:45:04] other one amen and then that evening the
[1:45:07] Israel of God says today as the
[1:45:09] scripture for for what scripture the day
[1:45:11] of vengeance of our God every day you
[1:45:14] read a Burt California every day you
[1:45:17] read about it and one day you'll not
[1:45:19] read about it because we'll be gone but
[1:45:20] it will sink now you say old George how
[1:45:22] can you say because it's thus saith the
[1:45:25] Lord and thus said the Lord is the
[1:45:28] promise thus said the Lord cannot be
[1:45:30] broken and was never broken in the
[1:45:32] scripture not one time not one time how
[1:45:35] many times
[1:45:36] hey man can you read annual Testament in
[1:45:39] the New Testament the promise and it was
[1:45:42] never broken it can't be broken
[1:45:44] hallelujah oh my my goodness
[1:45:46] praise the Lord listen to this look just
[1:45:49] listen to this as we just try and close
[1:45:50] down let you go home I know some of you
[1:45:52] gotta write tonight but oh my look at
[1:45:55] this here John look through the whole
[1:45:57] book of Revelation and he comes to a
[1:45:59] little thing and he sees us like we read
[1:46:02] earlier today but about the parade and
[1:46:05] walking in the lane and he sees us and
[1:46:08] he says the bride has made herself ready
[1:46:13] oh is that the Word of God is that
[1:46:18] really the Word of God
[1:46:19] you know when you think about it the
[1:46:22] brightest men know not then but I'll
[1:46:25] tell you what we've come on do a day
[1:46:27] when the bride has made herself ready

[1:46:34] the gospel show we're not we're not
[1:46:35] drinking I know your beer pots they're
[1:46:36] not giving your milk only maybe if you
[1:46:38] need an odd little supplement they might
[1:46:40] but I'll tell you what we're on the meat
[1:46:41] of the word and it says the bride that's
[1:46:45] what he saw projected Richter all day
[1:46:47] and says the bride has made herself
[1:46:50] ready
[1:46:50] so if scripture cannot be broken a man

[1:47:07] because God says she has that's what he
[1:47:09] saw it's not said the Lord and scripture
[1:47:12] cannot be broken that's why you can be
[1:47:15] certain of God because you know whatever
[1:47:18] promise he gives you they say it has to
[1:47:20] be fulfilled

[2:09:08] that's little
[2:09:12] Amen people I'd rather have the promises
[2:09:19] of God than everything else I could get
[2:09:21] into world right a promise that he made
[2:09:26] wait a while 44 filled with any got to
[2:09:30] do it
[2:09:31] I just need patience Dwight the word
[2:09:36] that I can wait for him to do what he
[2:09:37] said he did but now here's what we
[2:09:39] should think if he said it's already
[2:09:42] done
[2:09:44] cuz see he first does it then he reveals
[2:09:50] it speaks to you about it then he makes
[2:09:53] it manifest so then the promises are
[2:09:57] over the rapture has already been spoken
[2:10:00] the Prophet said there in the rapture
[2:10:02] message he said it has been spoken he
[2:10:07] realized that he had to spoke that I put
[2:10:11] my whole dependence upon that by the
[2:10:13] point he spoke it and God will keep his
[2:10:15] word
[2:10:16] and raddion anything that's brother
