[5:56] season time of
[5:59] Christmas and
[6:02] cheer and
[6:05] being with family and
[6:08] while we're all blessing each other I
[6:10] just talked to brother Mike I'll take a
[6:12] few minutes ago and he is um he's doing
[6:16] all right
[6:17] he is
[6:20] the only problem they have now is that
[6:24] uh
[6:25] they're looking at another brain bleed
[6:27] on the other side of his of his of his
[6:29] head
[6:30] they said is uh
[6:32] brain kind of at the uh when they had
[6:36] the accident it kind of was like a
[6:37] basketball it kind of went I said well
[6:39] at least it's full I mean at least you
[6:40] had I mean some of us probably you know
[6:43] be like this
[6:45] like what the old saying was about a BB
[6:48] in a boxcar
[6:49] but
[6:52] think of that one for a minute but he
[6:55] said that just keep praying for him uh
[6:57] he's calling off church for a few weeks
[6:59] to get on the men but uh the whole deal
[7:02] is is getting that uh stamp put in his
[7:05] heart where the aneurysm could be
[7:08] and they were going to do it
[7:11] um
[7:12] first of January but now they're gonna
[7:14] have to wait till the 27th of January to
[7:16] make sure that brain bleed doesn't
[7:18] uh uh according to him the doctor said
[7:21] it's getting better it's shrinking so
[7:24] we're just going to keep praying that
[7:25] everything's that everything shrinks
[7:27] down he's but remember him in his person
[7:32] he is is messing with his mind
[7:35] uh it's it's messing with his his psyche
[7:38] is messing with you know one we always
[7:40] ask why we we do ask why but there's a
[7:43] it's a purpose for everything I'm
[7:45] uh you know all the things that we go
[7:47] through in life
[7:49] is for a purpose
[7:50] you say well I got scars of this well
[7:52] maybe God lets you go through them so
[7:54] you can talk to somebody else about it
[7:56] tell them you went through it and look
[7:58] we made it through all right so you know
[8:01] if we were all if we all come here
[8:02] perfect was perfect
[8:04] we would never have a problem when when
[8:06] we surely wouldn't be able to talk to
[8:07] anybody that wasn't perfect
[8:10] so we all are imperfect as we were
[8:12] talking the other day about uh Bathsheba
[8:15] and the different ones
[8:18] there's only one Virgin Mary and that
[8:20] was the only one that produced a child
[8:22] and that was Jesus Christ everybody else
[8:25] had some scars
[8:26] everybody else had a past right so we do
[8:29] too so let's just remember brother Mike
[8:32] and Sister Janet in prayer and uh and
[8:36] and just remember his his thought
[8:39] process his his thinking and and not be
[8:42] depressed
[8:43] that depression man it'll it'll get you

[14:35] this place is it's hell on Earth we're
[14:38] just so protected a lot of times that
[14:41] God has protected us but people out
[14:43] there are struggling bad really bad and
[14:46] we appreciate
[14:48] um the Lord giving us a message of the
[14:50] hour
[14:50] more than ever the Holy Ghost but more
[14:53] than that too the message of the hour
[14:54] that we can that we can put on a tape or

[15:04] bow our heads Lord thank you for this
[15:06] evening you give us the Lord middle of
[15:07] the week
[15:09] and Lord I didn't mention but this
[15:11] weather coming in Lord we know there's
[15:12] not going to be a lot of precipitation
[15:14] but there's going to be a lot of cold
[15:17] temperatures
[15:18] and Lord for all of us it has to go
[15:20] outside and work Lord I pray that you'd
[15:22] keep us healthy and strong Lord and
[15:25] being the temperatures are going to be
[15:27] so low there'd be ice and be as brother
[15:30] Terence said we need to make sure we
[15:32] check our water and all the pipes and
[15:34] the lines Lord we pray Lord that you
[15:37] would just we know it's winter time we
[15:40] know we're not going to have 70 degree
[15:42] weather but Lord just let it not hurt
[15:44] anybody let all the cars be able to
[15:46] start and let all the heaters be able to
[15:48] run and let us not be without
[15:50] electricity Lord because they're saying
[15:52] we're going to have some strong wind
[15:53] along with that cold and Lord that's a
[15:56] combination for limbs falling on on
[15:59] trees falling on power lines and us
[16:02] being without power and it being the
[16:04] teens that's really really dangerous but
[16:08] father we know you are the master
[16:10] of the Wind
[16:12] you control all things Lord and you knew
[16:14] this before the foundation of the world
[16:15] and you knew we would pray tonight
[16:17] earnestly that you would help us the
[16:18] next three or four days Lord
[16:20] and as we come to December the 25th we
[16:22] know you were not born on that day
[16:24] but we honor you Lord that that you did
[16:27] come as a child and you were born of a
[16:29] virgin you come exactly the way the
[16:31] scripture said and we are just going to
[16:34] Lord just enjoy our time off Lord and
[16:37] enjoy our family and giving gifts to
[16:39] each other father I pray this the
[16:40] greatest gift would be that someone will
[16:43] receive the Holy Ghost this weekend that
[16:45] someone would receive the word of the
[16:47] hour Lord and come home to you Lord we
[16:50] pray that you'd just be with brother
[16:51] Mike OT Lord just bless him Lord he's a
[16:54] he's been a soldier for years and years
[16:57] more than we've been a lot of people
[16:59] have been born in this building Lord and
[17:01] I pray that you would just help him Lord
[17:03] help him in his in his uh not be
[17:05] depressed and not be the that Satan will
[17:07] not get in his mind and start making him
[17:10] worry about things because worry the
[17:12] Bible says and fear makes torment
[17:14] and we don't want that for our brother
[17:16] Lord comfort him in his time of need

[18:18] they're my favorite people
[18:24] all right let's go part 78. tonight
[18:27] we're going to talk a little bit more
[18:28] about virtue and being about being
[18:30] virtuous
[18:32] because the Bible tells us we're going
[18:34] to read here and we'll let you sit down
[18:35] in the beginning was the word where it
[18:36] was with God and the Word was God in
[18:38] other words everything we talk about
[18:39] everything there is everything in the
[18:41] Bible was before the foundation of the
[18:43] world
[18:44] God knew it he saw it he predestinated
[18:47] it by foreknowledge he saw what was
[18:49] going to happen and he predetermined it
[18:51] wrote it in the Bible and put it up and
[18:54] let man come to the Earth
[18:56] and then we live through we are now
[18:58] living through our predestination
[19:01] so that word was made flesh and you and
[19:04] dwelt among us and we beheld as glory of
[19:06] the glory of the only begotten the
[19:07] father full of grace and truth you may
[19:09] be seated in the Lord has blessing just
[19:11] for a minute tonight good to have
[19:12] everybody back brother Louise uh
[19:15] and brother Aaron and brother Bob
[19:17] couldn't have each one of them back and
[19:19] thank you for uh going out and letting
[19:22] your light shine and we appreciate that
[19:24] amen so um Luke 6 verse 19 says the
[19:28] whole multitude started to touch him for
[19:29] there went virtue out of him now
[19:31] remember what is virtue virtuous
[19:33] strength
[19:34] virtue is when we're going to talk a
[19:36] little bit about The Virtuous life
[19:38] because that virtuous life is that's
[19:41] here in Proverbs 31 who can find a
[19:43] virtuous woman and we were talking about
[19:44] this Sunday and and it really struck me
[19:48] that that this is Solomon
[19:52] talking about his mama
[19:55] don't get quiet on me this is Solomon
[19:58] right in Proverbs talking about his
[20:00] mother
[20:01] his mother that was ravished by a king
[20:04] come on somebody
[20:06] taken against her will
[20:10] basically you can't call it rape because
[20:12] he was a king if she'd have said no he'd
[20:14] have killed her he was Cain nobody
[20:17] questioned it
[20:18] but Bathsheba then had to learn to live
[20:21] with that
[20:22] had to learn to live with David killing
[20:25] her own husband
[20:27] listen to this
[20:29] taking her for a wife and then the first
[20:31] baby they had it was it was killed
[20:35] all right
[20:36] but in all that she kept her integrity
[20:38] and all that Solomon as he grew up he
[20:41] looks back and he says and and I was
[20:43] listening to a brother the other day
[20:45] talking about this even in the uh in the
[20:48] uh Jews and they have like um it's in
[20:53] their
[20:54] tradition
[20:56] said that that Solomon had a strong but
[20:59] right beside his and I swear Bathsheba
[21:01] said that's how much he thought of his
[21:03] mother he was married a thousand wives
[21:05] but he loved his mother why because he
[21:07] saw her come from where she was
[21:10] come on somebody uh this is us we're
[21:12] talking about I read you the quote where
[21:15] brother Brown says Where The Virtuous
[21:16] sinless bride of Jesus Christ
[21:18] something's got to be transformed
[21:20] something's got to come to a place to
[21:22] where even though we came out of the
[21:24] pits of hell yeah
[21:27] we can be virtuous
[21:29] who can find a virtuous woman for what
[21:31] her price is far above rubies we're
[21:36] going to read in just a minute that a
[21:37] virtuous woman is a crown
[21:39] to her husband we'll talk about that in
[21:42] a minute you know Jesus Christ is
[21:43] talking about crowning him and crowning
[21:45] him and crowning him he can't wear but
[21:47] one crown
[21:49] you know who his crown is
[21:51] it's Pride
[21:53] his bride is his crown
[21:56] he can't wear but one Crown you can't
[21:58] put 25 crowns on his head no he's king
[22:00] of kings and Lord of lords but he has a
[22:03] crown around him
[22:05] which is called his bride that's what
[22:07] we're going to talk about just a little
[22:08] bit down here a little bit closer but
[22:10] thank God I was thinking yesterday
[22:11] morning about these mystery truths all
[22:13] these things and the seals that you and
[22:16] I uh and I know some that are new in the
[22:18] message they don't really see the seals
[22:21] but if you've been in the message a
[22:23] while it's just a wonderful thing that
[22:25] God opened that up to a group of people
[22:27] so that we can see the mystery truth and
[22:29] not have to wonder whether the Methodist
[22:32] is right or the Presbyterian or right or
[22:34] the Baptist or right or the Pentecostal
[22:36] right or the brandemites are right
[22:39] God's right
[22:41] and he sent us a prophet to give us
[22:43] these mystery truths that will literally
[22:46] turn us back to the faith of the fathers
[22:48] it's going to literally change our body
[22:50] all right so these mystery truths that
[22:52] literally turn the hearts of the
[22:54] children to the Pentecostal fathers
[22:55] exactly so
[22:57] now how's it going to happen we've got
[23:00] to be Sanctified through the truth you
[23:02] can't be Sanctified through untruth now
[23:04] listen
[23:05] Luther Wesley they had some truth but
[23:08] remember they were reformers
[23:10] they're not restorers they were
[23:12] reformers they reformed you kind of like
[23:15] Alcoholics Anonymous
[23:17] they reform you but now they were
[23:19] Sanctified through their truth that they
[23:22] had for the day but they didn't have all
[23:24] the truth
[23:25] that's why they're laying in the grave
[23:27] that's why the Pentecostals that's why
[23:28] the Baptists that's why the people in
[23:30] Old Pentecost even new Pentecost they're
[23:33] laying in them there there they went
[23:34] down by the word that they had but it
[23:36] wasn't all truth
[23:39] Luther Wesleyan Pentecost until they had
[23:43] the Oneness movement they all are laying
[23:45] in the grave because they were filled
[23:47] with the Holy Ghost and baptized in the
[23:49] name of the father Son and Holy Ghost
[23:51] thereby with me but now you and I can't
[23:54] take that today and say well I'll just
[23:57] no
[23:58] we had a Prophet come to open the book
[24:00] to bring us the truth not a truth he
[24:03] brought us the truth he said as thou has
[24:06] sent me into the world even so I send
[24:08] you into the world so he's sending us
[24:09] listen brother Ryan could have just
[24:11] stayed in Jeffersonville preached 1100
[24:13] sermons he said I don't tape those don't
[24:15] worry about it no he knew he was going
[24:18] to be worldwide he knew that it would be
[24:20] the days of the voice of the seventh
[24:23] angel that when he begins to sound well
[24:27] come on let's be truthful when he was
[24:30] here nobody understood who he was
[24:32] just like Jesus Christ nobody understood
[24:34] who Jesus was when he was here but the
[24:36] group after
[24:38] come on somebody the group after
[24:40] one that understood the disciples on the
[24:43] dead Pentecost 120 as they went out into
[24:45] the world they understood why that man
[24:47] was doing what he did and said what he
[24:49] said after he left
[24:51] after you hear the word of Truth The
[24:54] Gospel of your salvation in other words
[24:55] after you get born again then we've got
[24:57] a a message that now we have been sent
[25:01] to send it to the world brother Joe
[25:03] Greene now is over in the Philippines he
[25:05] was asking me to go with him and I just
[25:07] couldn't because of the time period but
[25:09] he's over there now spreading the gospel
[25:11] praying the truth helping the people out
[25:13] and it's the truth
[25:16] I hate it and it's going to be on their
[25:18] head for these people that that say this
[25:20] message is wrong and then try to
[25:22] disprove it
[25:26] that's just like disproving that God's
[25:29] God
[25:31] can't do it that's just proven that the
[25:33] Lord was nobody but a but a uh just a
[25:36] good man a good Prophet you know that
[25:37] you still see that because their eyes
[25:39] have been blinded but when that veils
[25:41] comes off their eyes they're going to
[25:43] see that they're Messiah is who they
[25:45] killed but listen it's not going to be
[25:47] all Jews
[25:49] not every Jew over there it's only 144
[25:52] 000. not to four or five million that's
[25:54] over there now they're going to be just
[25:56] as lost as the rest of the Gentiles is
[25:58] lost
[25:59] and for their sake I sanctify myself why
[26:02] that he can turn and look at the
[26:03] disciples and say look you can live like
[26:05] me
[26:08] as I live in this world so do you
[26:11] as I was sent into this world as brother
[26:13] boy and I were talking sitting in there
[26:15] but remember they called him everything
[26:17] but God
[26:20] they called him a devil called him a
[26:22] wine bibber did you hang around
[26:24] and and sinners all the time you just
[26:26] all around all these people just a
[26:28] filthy bunch
[26:29] he said I didn't come to the people that
[26:31] wasn't sick
[26:32] he said I come to seek to sick people
[26:37] he came to sick people
[26:39] we needed him to heal us
[26:44] and then in our physical body and for
[26:47] their sake I sanctify myself that look
[26:49] that they also might be what Sanctified
[26:51] through the truth
[26:53] so now I believe we have the truth so
[26:55] let's just put that out of the way
[26:57] if you don't believe we have the truth
[26:58] you need to get that out of the way
[27:00] before you leave
[27:02] or you need to leave
[27:03] I mean really it's time to quit fooling
[27:05] around it's kind of need to get in or
[27:06] get out don't put one foot
[27:09] on this side of the fence in the
[27:10] straddle the fence nope
[27:13] remember Satan owns the fence
[27:17] but you see people in the messaging
[27:19] I think Junior and I were talking about
[27:21] this the other day that are always right
[27:23] on the line
[27:26] always right on that line just pushing
[27:28] the line you're gonna get sucked into
[27:31] the world is what you're going to get
[27:33] you're gonna get sucked in the world why
[27:35] not the Bible says flee from the
[27:37] appearance of evil flee
[27:39] flee from that fence that you think well
[27:42] maybe I can get by because my dress is
[27:44] not exactly the way they said and uh
[27:47] come on now
[27:50] we're going to either either live right
[27:53] or we don't live right we're going to
[27:55] get sucked into the world all right
[27:57] that's why I believe I believe church is
[28:00] not just because I say come to church
[28:02] but the Bible says come to church I get
[28:03] strength when I come to church
[28:05] I I get I get what I need from church
[28:08] tell me you get what you need out there
[28:12] no you get what you need in here
[28:15] this is what you live on as we're gonna
[28:17] see right here brother Brown said you're
[28:18] not you have a free world agency and
[28:21] then we're going to talk about we know
[28:22] we're talking about the middle round the
[28:23] spirit Realm
[28:25] but look if it's the spirit of God it'll
[28:28] feed on the things of God it won't feed
[28:30] on anything of the world
[28:32] all right so what do you listen I love
[28:36] steak most of you do too but now I don't
[28:39] like
[28:41] hummus
[28:49] that's for a different kind of people
[28:56] but you say well it's just still it's
[28:58] still food
[28:59] yeah
[29:00] but I don't like hummus
[29:03] I like to come to church on Wednesday
[29:05] night and get meat because I'm an eagle
[29:09] I'm not a
[29:11] worm
[29:14] that can eat that stuff
[29:17] sorry about that brother John you like
[29:19] hummus you don't thank you brother at
[29:20] least we're we're the only two
[29:23] I think there's others in here too but
[29:25] remember what do we feed on listen like
[29:27] brother Brown said so if you're gonna
[29:29] feed on the things of the world you'll
[29:30] like that
[29:32] but I like to feed on meat because I'm
[29:34] an eagle all right we we want to eat
[29:37] Eagle food that's why I come to church
[29:39] that's why I press play that's why I
[29:40] listen to the ministry
[29:43] all right
[29:44] now look brother Ryan tells us didn't
[29:47] the most important thing for us to do
[29:49] though is obeying what God Said do it's
[29:51] what brings your power
[29:53] all right let's just take it all in a
[29:55] nutshell you say well let's pray in this
[29:57] fasting that's coming to certain it is
[29:58] but let's just put it all into one thing
[30:01] obeying the word of God will bring you
[30:04] the power it will bring you virtue
[30:07] it's what brought virtue is obedience to
[30:09] the word of God and we read in first
[30:11] Samuel
[30:12] what about a prophet
[30:14] saying Saul kill them all get rid of
[30:17] them let's not ever see him on the face
[30:18] of the Earth again let's not have one of
[30:20] them little demons grow up to be a big
[30:22] demon
[30:23] hello somebody
[30:26] because if he's dead he won't bother you
[30:27] anymore
[30:29] but if you just put him in a closet or
[30:30] if you just like Saul was going to put
[30:32] him in a put them in a uh in a jail cell
[30:35] well they got a chance to get out
[30:38] and they steal your enemy I don't care
[30:40] if he's in the jail that's still your
[30:42] enemy Samuel said we're going to take
[30:45] care of that I told you to obey what God
[30:48] Said but you didn't
[30:50] so obeying is better than sacrifice and
[30:54] to hearken than the fat of brown for
[30:55] Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft as
[30:59] I was telling you all before it and I'll
[31:01] tell you again Rebellion is not doing
[31:04] what God Said
[31:06] right
[31:08] coming to church late
[31:10] that's Rebellion because you know better
[31:16] but I get to church by the way that's
[31:18] not what the whole thing is
[31:21] the prophet of God said 20 minutes
[31:23] before the service starts you need to be
[31:25] in the sanctuary praying reading your
[31:27] Bible
[31:29] and some of you get here 20 minutes
[31:31] after so you're rebellious and a
[31:34] rebellious
[31:36] I'm just reading you what the Bible says
[31:38] Rebellion is the sin of Witchcraft and
[31:41] stubbornness
[31:42] oh my right here buddy
[31:45] oh y'all point this way
[31:50] stubborn guy right here I'm working on
[31:52] it y'all y'all are helping me work on it
[31:54] too
[31:55] foreign
[31:56] stubbornness is as iniquity and adultery
[31:59] because you know not to do it you know
[32:00] not to be selfish or stubborn be
[32:02] stubborn because stubborn has nothing to
[32:05] do with God because what are we supposed
[32:06] to do I'm going to read you something in
[32:07] just a minute that's going to blow your
[32:09] mind what the brother Brown said about
[32:11] coming together as a virtuous woman and
[32:14] a man getting married which will be the
[32:16] type of us in Christ I hope y'all are
[32:19] seeing this this is not just women every
[32:21] time I say virtuous woman I'm talking
[32:23] about you if you're the bride not
[32:26] talking about you if you're not bride
[32:28] everybody with me all right these are
[32:31] all stories of virtuous women and now we
[32:36] are the bride listen there
[32:38] an example
[32:40] you're the real product
[32:49] I'm gonna read you here in just a minute
[32:50] we'll get to it I'll make sure we do if
[32:51] I have to scroll through all this
[32:53] because it's a wonderful quote very
[32:54] profound
[32:55] because thou Hast rejected the word of
[32:58] the Lord he has also rejected thee from
[33:00] being King all right so he what he took
[33:02] the kingdom away from Saul just because
[33:04] of one item
[33:07] one thing
[33:09] he disobeyed the word of God
[33:12] are they okay with that I'm reading the
[33:14] Bible
[33:15] now brother Brown says we're not
[33:17] building an organization this is why I
[33:18] want you to see we are built as
[33:20] individuals so I don't want you to look
[33:23] as we go up to Statue of perfect man and
[33:24] say well now Donnie he's just been Heap
[33:27] he ain't even well Lord I think he's
[33:30] just at Faith well that ain't none of
[33:31] your business
[33:33] okay
[33:34] you make sure wait Dale's at face
[33:37] and virtue and knowledge and Temperance
[33:39] and patience and godliness you worry
[33:41] about yourself because Christ didn't
[33:42] send us to build this whole church as an
[33:44] organization
[33:46] Christ sent brother Branham me to build
[33:48] individuals to the statue of Jesus
[33:50] Christ that they might what be the
[33:52] powerhouse
[33:54] the PowerHouse and the dwelling place of
[33:56] the Spirit by his word
[33:58] I was just reading some quotes back here
[34:01] everybody was um you remember the
[34:04] the woman that committed adultery on her
[34:06] husband and then brother Brown discerned
[34:08] that she was going crazy she'd been to
[34:10] every doctor she had been to every place
[34:12] she could go and she comes to talk to
[34:14] brother Brown and brother Brown says you
[34:16] had an affair right when you first got
[34:18] married and you have not told that to
[34:20] your husband
[34:21] she says I can't do I can't tell him
[34:23] that he's a deacon of the church
[34:24] remember what brother Brown say he said
[34:26] well your husband's got the same thing
[34:28] to tell you about and she said no not my
[34:30] husband I was just reading it no not my
[34:33] husband there's no way he said okay lady
[34:35] he said if you want to be healed he said
[34:37] you go get your husband and you got to
[34:39] come back here and make it right
[34:41] because you didn't sin against God
[34:43] you're sitting against your husband
[34:45] so the story goes as you keep going on
[34:47] what happens they she comes and she said
[34:49] I gotta confess he said well
[34:52] she says now this man told me she didn't
[34:54] call brother and they said this man told
[34:55] me you were in a blue Cadillac with a
[34:57] girl with a pink dress works for
[34:59] Chevrolet
[35:01] and he said who told you that
[35:03] well brother Brown had discerned it but
[35:06] anyway instead of him saying bless God
[35:08] I'm just you know that's I'm the man I
[35:11] do what I want to do no they both got
[35:13] down on their knees they both asked
[35:14] forgiveness to each other they both came
[35:15] to brother Brown because brother Brown's
[35:17] wife said Billy you think they'll be
[35:19] back he said they'll be back
[35:21] he'd already seen it he said they'll be
[35:23] back and we're starting to a deacon in
[35:26] the church
[35:30] because they what
[35:32] they confessed it but he said he said
[35:34] lady he said what church do you go to he
[35:36] said brother John says he said no wonder
[35:37] Brothers Johnson church is not moving
[35:39] because of that one unconfessed sin of
[35:41] that woman that she did when she was a
[35:43] white probably wasn't even the church
[35:47] he said that devil will lay there
[35:52] until you get it out
[35:54] time to let it out folks time to confess
[35:57] it all we've all done things that we
[35:59] need to get rid of and we're not a
[36:01] Powerhouse yet somebody asked the other
[36:02] day said well what's holding us back
[36:06] each of our individual unconfessed sins
[36:08] you said I got to confess you need to
[36:10] confess to God
[36:12] if you did something wrong
[36:15] everybody with me Lord bless whoever
[36:17] that is
[36:19] if they had a wreck or something
[36:22] but he wants us to build up individuals
[36:24] and he told that lady he said lady they
[36:26] could have pour a 55 gallon drum of
[36:29] anointing oil on your head and he said
[36:31] it wouldn't do you any good
[36:33] right that one thing 55 gallons of
[36:37] anointed oil
[36:38] and it won't do a bit of good he said
[36:40] Satan has a right to stay right there
[36:42] now when they confessed and came back
[36:44] brother round said I laid my hands on
[36:46] her he said Satan now you have no right
[36:48] and he said the devil left her and he
[36:50] said they got back together reconciled
[36:52] with each other went back to church
[36:55] Powerhouse to me that made a Powerhouse
[36:58] of a church just because of us
[37:00] confessing all of our faults one to the
[37:03] other
[37:03] but that's the idea that when going up
[37:05] this pyramid onto your face virtue
[37:07] versus knowledge well now you're coming
[37:09] to a place and we know virtue we'll talk
[37:12] about this just for a minute
[37:14] virtue is what power anyone knows what
[37:16] the word virtue means we must have it
[37:19] virtue went from him to heal the woman
[37:22] that was sick he's expecting the same
[37:24] virtue in his church
[37:26] not a substitute the same identical why
[37:29] is it because it's him transferred into
[37:31] you
[37:32] it's him him the person of Jesus Christ
[37:34] transferred into your body yes what a
[37:37] paradox
[37:39] you're a walking Jesus Christ you just
[37:41] don't know it yet
[37:43] your mind has been so muddled and so so
[37:46] taken over by the world
[37:48] your memory reason contraception
[37:50] imagination is just bottling that thing
[37:52] up
[37:53] it's like an atomic bomb that goes off
[37:55] in a little bitty little bitty area
[37:57] about that big
[37:59] you've got it all locked up but when you
[38:02] ever let it get one crack
[38:04] let's let it out this year folks and
[38:06] let's just have one crack
[38:08] you get one cracking that thing will
[38:10] just explode and we'll become a better
[38:12] Church
[38:14] everybody wants to become a better
[38:16] Church don't we don't even want to be
[38:17] become a better church we want God to
[38:19] work in our life we want them not to
[38:20] just have dull services and and well
[38:23] well that one's that one was okay and
[38:26] and this one's all right brother Bob's a
[38:28] little off last night if somebody's back
[38:30] here preaching I just use Bob if
[38:32] somebody if somebody's up here preaching
[38:33] the word of God they ain't off if
[38:36] they're telling you the truth right it
[38:38] may be that you didn't like what Bob
[38:40] said which made him wrong
[38:42] but God didn't ask you if you thought it
[38:44] was right
[38:46] virtue in anyone else so I'll praise God
[38:49] anyone knows that the word virtue means
[38:51] see we must have it The Virtue went from
[38:53] him to heal the woman that was sick he's
[38:55] expecting the same virtue in his church
[38:57] because he was our example and if we had
[38:59] virtue to give to the people he expects
[39:02] us to have verse and if he had virtue to
[39:04] give to the people he expects us to have
[39:06] virtue to give to the people and what is
[39:08] virtue virtue is strength or power every
[39:10] once in a while go back and watch that
[39:12] uh movie of brother random of
[39:15] where he was in Washington D.C
[39:18] and watch that you watch him he's just
[39:20] he's preaching away and it don't look
[39:22] like he's he's not any kind of stress or
[39:25] or you know he's just preaching away and
[39:27] but all of a sudden when he turns that
[39:28] prayer line you see him start wobbling
[39:31] you see him start moving and you see
[39:32] brother Billy Paul reach and grab him
[39:34] under his armpits because he's so he
[39:36] what that's virtue
[39:38] that's the strength that people were
[39:40] pulling out of him because even brother
[39:42] random explains it thank God he did
[39:44] explain a lot of things to us he said
[39:45] now I can see certain Visions from God
[39:47] he said I can have 50 visions
[39:50] and it don't bother me one bit he said
[39:52] but one discernment on that platform
[39:54] because what that person's drawing it
[39:56] out of him when you're saying when
[39:58] you're seeing a vision it's not somebody
[39:59] grabbing or pulling anything but when
[40:02] you've got a person standing there and
[40:03] they're drawing strength from you it's
[40:05] coming from your human body and you
[40:07] become weak but thank God he's explained
[40:09] that
[40:10] brother Brown says you got to have
[40:11] virtue for what your community
[40:15] just your church
[40:17] yep no
[40:20] whole world
[40:22] if you have faith you must have virtue
[40:24] with it you have virtue for the whole
[40:26] world and he's talking about Reverend Mr
[40:28] Lilly
[40:30] what happened to Lily
[40:32] starts in the mud
[40:34] he pushes out and what happens to the
[40:36] Lily when it opens up the bee comes and
[40:38] gets
[40:39] the pollen like I was saying before and
[40:41] it still makes me chuckle a little bit
[40:42] when you go through a cemetery and you
[40:44] see all those plastic flowers and you
[40:45] see the bees you know you just see a bee
[40:47] flying over going this is great lands on
[40:50] that thing and goes
[40:52] hmm
[40:55] no virtue
[40:56] that's the same thing with me and you
[40:59] does the world see enough virtue in us
[41:01] to land on us and know they can get
[41:02] virtue out of us
[41:04] come on somebody I like it when it gets
[41:06] quiet with thinking
[41:07] it opens itself up for honey that's why
[41:10] a true pastor
[41:15] me me me me no what we open ourselves up
[41:19] we open ourselves up and and draw
[41:22] strength from that for the bee comes and
[41:23] gets his part don't complain it just
[41:26] gets it it's just got it to give out
[41:29] what if the bee comes in there
[41:31] insufficient funds no honey that will be
[41:33] would scratch his head and say what kind
[41:34] of Lily is that
[41:37] look he's not selfish
[41:40] he's got older before he can give out
[41:42] already he's got to have it before he
[41:43] can give out honey it's got to have it
[41:45] before you give out Beauty he's got to
[41:46] have it before you can give out virtue
[41:48] you have to have it so add to your faith
[41:49] virtue
[41:51] listen remember she touched not his
[41:52] physical body but she pulled out of him
[41:55] what she needed and then we're talking
[41:57] about the three pulls and we know what
[41:58] that is that's the pull to Ren to tear
[42:00] what she does is what she did is she
[42:03] tore the strength out of the Lord Jesus
[42:05] and those people at the platform they
[42:07] tore out of brother Brown they tore out
[42:09] now remember the first poll was he would
[42:11] take him by the hand now he didn't
[42:12] stagger during that time I mean we don't
[42:14] realize that but he didn't never say
[42:16] anything about getting weed but he said
[42:17] when he started doing the discernment
[42:19] when he started getting weak because
[42:21] he'd hold him by the hand and then his
[42:22] little pimples would come up and he'd
[42:25] tell them what it is
[42:26] but boy when he was digging into their
[42:28] life he was going into their soul
[42:31] he was going into the very being he
[42:32] wasn't just he wasn't just he wasn't
[42:34] just the outside guy holding the hand
[42:36] said well you know you got cancer we
[42:38] know he could tell them where that was
[42:39] at anyway so he was probably seeing a
[42:40] vision but when they come to that
[42:42] discernment that was really the Lord
[42:44] Jesus doing the Discerning it was not
[42:46] William Branham
[42:48] so when he entered that body you say
[42:50] well he was already in there by the Holy
[42:51] Ghost yes that's true but there's
[42:53] anointings why did Brother brown with
[42:55] the baptism of the Holy Ghost said he
[42:57] stood there and said I can't do nothing
[42:58] until he comes
[43:00] what you would think now as a human
[43:02] being you would think he had that inside
[43:04] of him already and he just thought
[43:05] blurted it out no
[43:07] special anointing
[43:09] that came to that prophet he said I'm
[43:11] waiting on him and he would say many
[43:13] times he'd say what did I just say
[43:16] he told one one time he said hey as
[43:18] listen to other days he said whatever I
[43:21] said lady was right now what's up he
[43:24] said but whatever until he depended on
[43:25] that was God telling he said lady
[43:27] whatever I said it was right you need to
[43:28] do that he didn't even remember what he
[43:30] said
[43:31] but we're sitting under the third pool
[43:33] we're we went through the first pool
[43:35] went second pull is what
[43:39] to me it's the virtues the third pull is
[43:41] coming we know that it's the opening of
[43:42] the seals but we've got to go through to
[43:45] draw the support or attention of I want
[43:49] the world to draw attention to me and
[43:51] you
[43:52] that we're different
[43:55] that we're not just
[43:57] the world with a little bit of extra on
[43:59] it
[44:02] are
[44:03] like brother Brown said some people have
[44:05] these virtues not even born again
[44:06] they're just good people like Brother
[44:08] Richard Wilson said he was working with
[44:10] a guy one time he said that guy was so
[44:12] Meek and Mild
[44:13] that he said I believe if you took his
[44:15] paycheck and said Ronnie I'm gonna take
[44:16] your paycheck and I'm you're gonna cash
[44:18] it and give it to me
[44:20] he said I believe the man to do it and
[44:22] he wouldn't he wouldn't get mad at you a
[44:24] bill
[44:24] that he'd never been mad today in his
[44:26] life well now
[44:27] boy his Temperance was gone because he
[44:30] had no temper
[44:31] but he probably was not born again
[44:35] and probably if he didn't get the
[44:36] baptism of Holy Ghost we know where he's
[44:38] at at the moment
[44:39] he's waiting his judgment
[44:42] but we want the world to be attracted to
[44:45] us through Jesus Christ
[44:47] not through me like the sports stars oh
[44:50] yeah there's a point there's a pool out
[44:52] there folks you know that it's pulling
[44:54] our young kids away pulling some of us
[44:56] away
[44:59] watch this instead of this
[45:01] go to a you know what
[45:04] well I'm gonna say it anyway
[45:06] hahaha
[45:08] you see people that can't come to church
[45:10] yet you see them at all kind of
[45:11] functions on Facebook
[45:18] so what can you draw strength from that
[45:21] is there any virtue in that
[45:24] nope
[45:25] nope there's no virtue in that
[45:28] we make all kind of excuses but you know
[45:30] what this is the hour and this is the
[45:32] day
[45:33] I was talking to somebody on the phone
[45:34] the other day this is the out you're
[45:36] going to manifest who you are oh brother
[45:38] Tim cross is going to be with us in
[45:41] February when I go to the wedding in
[45:44] Ohio if we're still doing that I think
[45:46] we are but he will be here with you that
[45:48] weekend bro Tim and I were talking about
[45:49] that
[45:51] so but just pray for him but that's what
[45:53] it is I mean if the world's falling
[45:55] apart and here we are still in the world
[45:59] but our discernment should be that it
[46:01] pulls out the virtues that's already in
[46:03] the Holy Ghost it's not that it's not
[46:05] that that you know here hold on this for
[46:07] a second all right that's virtue and
[46:09] I've got the Holy Ghost and I got to go
[46:11] and and buy it from somewhere
[46:14] it's already inside of you what you got
[46:16] to do is is what he said have an outlet
[46:20] gotta drill a hole
[46:22] played for the water to get out for the
[46:24] virtue to get out because listen you and
[46:27] I were born in sin and still have a
[46:30] sinful nature in the outside guy the
[46:33] memories and conservation imagination
[46:34] now inside if you're born again you
[46:36] don't have that
[46:38] so let's let that work more let's let
[46:40] that out more
[46:42] you say how
[46:44] read your Bible
[46:46] when you
[46:48] are reading something else
[46:51] or as Louise says when you got your
[46:53] Netflix owner what is it uh
[46:56] you all them ones you were talking about
[46:58] Sister Clay the toll toll brother
[47:01] Luis the other day she said I don't know
[47:02] what you talking about that Tick Tock
[47:03] and tender and all that well I don't
[47:05] even know what you're talking about
[47:05] thank God you don't know what he's
[47:07] talking about
[47:09] because I probably want I promise you
[47:11] one thing it is messing with people's
[47:13] minds
[47:14] hours included yeah
[47:17] it's what I said you can't come to
[47:19] church and sit in a church service for a
[47:21] couple hours but you can go to your
[47:22] kid's birthday party and set two or
[47:24] three hours
[47:26] it's all in what you want to do
[47:28] has nothing to do with
[47:30] well I might get sick or I might get
[47:33] when we gonna throw that devil out of
[47:35] here
[47:36] amen
[47:37] but remember it you got it but remember
[47:39] you can't be the Lily that's plastic
[47:43] and say Come on B yeah come on down here
[47:46] and then there'd be nothing there for
[47:47] the bee to get
[47:49] that be my sting you
[47:52] if it don't get honey it just might
[47:54] sting you if you don't get some pollen
[47:56] so I want to be cautious and not say
[47:58] well we just need to throw everything
[47:59] out to the wind you all know that
[48:01] we need to know that we know that we
[48:03] know we need to know that God's working
[48:04] in our life and that he is building us
[48:06] up to a Powerhouse of the word of God
[48:09] and then the third poll was what brother
[48:11] Brown said it can't be imitated it was
[48:13] the opening of the seal Satan doesn't
[48:15] know anything about this that's one
[48:17] thing Satan doesn't know about me and
[48:18] you it's how those seals open and
[48:20] they're going to change our body because
[48:22] see he can't take a body change
[48:24] so he can't be he listen he was the
[48:27] writers in the seal
[48:29] right he was the one that had the thing
[48:30] hid
[48:32] he was the one that got on his White
[48:34] Horse and wrote it through the people he
[48:37] got on his red horse brother Ryan said
[48:38] he got off the white one got on the red
[48:40] one and rode right through those
[48:42] denominations
[48:44] that's why the denominations have
[48:45] there's no denomination he's going to
[48:47] ever know what third pull is brother
[48:49] Ramsey no impersonate the first pull you
[48:51] can impersonate the second pull and
[48:53] plenty of people did
[48:54] but when you come to the opening of the
[48:56] word what do you do he stood by himself
[48:59] no one else came behind him except us
[49:01] because remember he said it's not for
[49:03] you it's not for the 1963 people sorry
[49:07] about that
[49:08] but I believe in dispensations
[49:10] this is a dispensation to know when
[49:13] brother Brown stood there said it's not
[49:14] for you said but right around the coming
[49:16] of the Lord these things will be made
[49:17] known well this is the coming of the
[49:19] Lord folks so these things are going to
[49:20] have to be made no we're going to have
[49:22] to come yeah but we can't get stuck in a
[49:24] second pool either
[49:26] this arm is good it's wonderful
[49:29] but
[49:31] think about this
[49:33] when you take that second pull
[49:36] and you listen to the tapes
[49:39] 99.9 of the time I can't remember one
[49:42] that didn't brother Branson I'm waiting
[49:44] on him
[49:46] I'm waiting on him
[49:48] if he doesn't come I can't do anything
[49:49] I'm waiting on him then he'd say he's
[49:51] here
[49:53] well now go to 1964 and 65 he had just
[49:56] small prayer lines then
[49:58] they weren't big auditoriums because
[50:00] they they didn't like his doctor no more
[50:02] he was preaching Doctrine and they
[50:04] didn't like it no more so only a few of
[50:06] the faithful ones were there but you
[50:07] know what he did
[50:09] when he got finished with a sermon
[50:11] look at a couple in 64 and 65. he starts
[50:14] Discerning right there
[50:16] he and God had something come so close
[50:18] together in those seals and in that in
[50:21] that headstone that he wasn't waiting on
[50:24] Jesus to come anymore
[50:28] we're not commissioned the bride's not
[50:31] commissioned to wait on Jesus Christ
[50:33] anymore
[50:35] brother Brian said I'm not saying he's
[50:36] coming I'm saying he's here
[50:39] but what is it herein he's here in
[50:41] discernment
[50:42] he's hearing the word of God and we're
[50:45] not waiting for the discernment to
[50:47] happen
[50:49] oh you're saying boy it makes you better
[50:51] than the prophet I can hear somebody
[50:52] thinking it right now
[50:53] no that doesn't he's the one that said
[50:56] it I didn't
[50:57] the Bible said in the days of the voice
[50:59] of the seventh angel well who's the
[51:02] voice of that seventh angel it is his
[51:04] bride
[51:05] the voice is in his bride
[51:07] [Applause]
[51:09] it's transferred off those books and
[51:11] tapes and become a Living Word of God
[51:13] it's become something that you and I
[51:15] just don't use as quotes anymore come on
[51:17] somebody we're living this thing out
[51:19] we're not prophesying anymore we're part
[51:22] of the prophecy we are the prophecy
[51:27] I can imagine them Apostles never acted
[51:30] like us now brother Brown's just
[51:31] ditching us pretty good right here I
[51:33] said I can imagine them Apostles never
[51:35] acted like us they went around probably
[51:37] meant a few words until they got In a
[51:39] Pulpit
[51:40] they walked in they've done what they
[51:42] were supposed to do and they walked out
[51:45] yes sir they had power
[51:48] they had virtue
[51:50] they had no arguments with men
[51:53] they knew where they stood that's all
[51:56] they knew who they believed
[51:58] they kept on walking in the spirit
[52:01] just as I said the other night that one
[52:03] little nod that's all God had to do then
[52:06] nothing was going to stop them now what
[52:09] we were supposed to be restored back to
[52:10] is everybody with me tonight
[52:12] we're supposed to be restored back to
[52:14] that I'm reading right here
[52:17] that's only in discernment though second
[52:19] Paul that's not the third ball
[52:21] right that's the second poll
[52:23] that's discernment of spirits they were
[52:25] able to discern as the first church age
[52:28] but they had nothing as far as the seals
[52:31] go
[52:34] listen John wrote symbols
[52:37] John didn't interpret he wrote symbols
[52:40] but oh praise God when he eat the book
[52:42] when he eat the buck that next group of
[52:46] people that he was being a part of but
[52:50] he was acting out the part
[52:53] of us eating the book
[52:55] we become the book
[52:58] and then the Bible says prophesy
[53:02] to many tongues many nations that's what
[53:06] we're doing
[53:08] look what's this they didn't question
[53:10] and study in hum Hall and worry like we
[53:13] do this is the prophet
[53:16] whether they should do this
[53:18] are whether they should do that
[53:20] they went ahead and done it anyhow
[53:23] just one little nod from God that done
[53:25] it just as soon
[53:27] I'll tell you it happened to me one time
[53:28] very privately one time we were in
[53:31] Jamaica dad and I we were up on the
[53:32] mountain they were getting ready to um
[53:34] build a church there called uh Ginger
[53:36] Hill the church hadn't been built yet
[53:38] big old huge tit they were several
[53:41] hundred people in under that tent and
[53:43] sister Brady was there and she just had
[53:45] her operation for breast surgery and she
[53:48] she had to hold her hand uh none of all
[53:50] I don't think been a part of it I got a
[53:52] neighbor not a neighbor but somebody's
[53:54] on my route
[53:55] your your arm it bothers you because
[53:58] they take all those lymph nodes out and
[53:59] they take the breast off they take the
[54:01] they take the muscles off and your arm
[54:03] just swells up it gets this big there's
[54:05] a customer I got Heather
[54:08] um matters she her hand is she's got a
[54:11] little compression thing on it to keep
[54:13] it because it's big because they took
[54:15] all the lymph nodes out well sister Bray
[54:16] they did the same thing she had her arm
[54:17] up like this right here in the service
[54:19] and she was just praising God we were
[54:21] just praising God
[54:22] and I preached on the vision that
[54:25] brother Branham
[54:26] dad you remember that
[54:28] I preached on Division
[54:30] remember brother Brown had a vision
[54:32] about Jamaica about people going up the
[54:34] mountain and coming back and up the
[54:35] mountain coming back and I told him I
[54:37] said you are now that Vision we were on
[54:39] top of a mountain we were on Ginger hill
[54:42] we were getting ready to establish the
[54:44] church and they were going every day up
[54:46] and down that mountain bringing us in
[54:48] and bringing us out dad preach the
[54:49] morning servants I preached the
[54:51] afternoon service and I told him I said
[54:53] you are now that Vision you're not a
[54:55] prophecy you're the people standing up
[54:57] brother around Saul your face he might
[54:59] not called your name but he saw you
[55:01] and boy the power of God hit that
[55:03] building
[55:06] and I did one thing
[55:08] that I regret to this day
[55:11] God told me he said speak to Sister
[55:12] Brady and she'll be healed and I didn't
[55:16] I didn't do it
[55:17] you know why I doubt it
[55:21] Paul yeah I'm sorry I'm supposed to be
[55:24] I'm going to be truthful
[55:26] and that that's bothered me that's been
[55:28] what about 20 years ago 15 years ago
[55:32] it bothers me to this day
[55:34] then I didn't go ahead and speak the
[55:36] auction
[55:37] you say well what if it didn't happen
[55:38] well I believe I finally said it it
[55:41] would have happened
[55:42] because I believe that was God Satan
[55:44] doesn't want you to get well right Satan
[55:47] does not want you to get better
[55:52] how many times did Brother Dale
[55:55] many times in a crowd you don't even
[55:56] know he's praying for you and you tell
[55:57] him about a problem you got he just
[56:00] walks behind you and grabs you back not
[56:01] your sisters we know that but he'll take
[56:04] you by the handshake hand and may give
[56:05] you that little extra squeeze you know
[56:07] what that is that's that virtue oozing
[56:10] out of his hand
[56:11] or or somebody like I had back trouble
[56:13] one time and Brother Dean the same way
[56:15] you just touch your back hug them in
[56:17] that you know just pound them on the
[56:18] back you ain't got to start screaming
[56:20] and shaking and shouting and everything
[56:21] else no
[56:22] just hug them in the neck say God touch
[56:25] them and guess what
[56:27] he did it
[56:28] and he's done it to us many many times
[56:31] folks that's that's virtue
[56:34] I missed that naughty you know
[56:37] she ain't got to hold her hand up like
[56:39] this but I'm gonna apologize to her when
[56:40] I get there
[56:42] when she comes back here and I glorified
[56:43] body and we'll say honey I'm sorry if
[56:46] I'd have said what I supposed to have
[56:47] said maybe you wouldn't had this trouble
[56:49] because she had trouble with that arm
[56:50] all the time she always had to keep it
[56:52] up over her head like this to keep
[56:54] circulation from making her arms swell
[56:56] up and I and I hate that
[56:58] what are you trying to say
[57:00] if you get an auction
[57:03] let it out
[57:05] Let It Go
[57:07] you know if I walk up brother and I say
[57:09] brother now you mind if I pray for you
[57:10] if he says no you don't need to pray for
[57:12] me there's nothing wrong with me they
[57:15] might be the next day
[57:16] but there might be something coming that
[57:18] God sees that he wants you to have a
[57:20] connection with we need to be probably
[57:23] I'm trying to say a little more
[57:24] spiritual than we all that we have been
[57:25] because that's what happened in the
[57:27] first church age they were a spiritual
[57:29] bunch of people they little not from God
[57:32] compared with every bit of this and with
[57:35] his word
[57:37] so there's healing in the word of God
[57:38] right there's faith in the word of God
[57:40] right Lay Your Hands on the seat in the
[57:43] shower cover I just reading just now was
[57:45] I was looking up something about
[57:47] I can't remember what it was he said you
[57:49] don't have to be a deacon you don't have
[57:50] to be a preacher he said the Bible says
[57:52] lay hands on the set he said you sisters
[57:54] lay hands on the set
[57:56] y'all feel somebody having trouble go
[57:58] lay hands on them
[58:01] the first little knot of God compared
[58:03] with everybody listen with his word they
[58:05] note it was the word of God and look
[58:07] away they went
[58:10] didn't have to worry about nothing you
[58:12] know what we have to worry about now we
[58:13] have to worry about a denominational
[58:15] demon
[58:16] a whirly demon a Wi-Fi demon a website
[58:21] demon
[58:22] uh
[58:24] you name it
[58:26] but listen
[58:29] God made us for this hour
[58:31] if he made us for this hour he will
[58:33] equip us to what we need
[58:35] listen we're not going to fall apart if
[58:37] you're an astronaut
[58:39] astronaut you will not fall apart
[58:40] because why you you've trusted NASA
[58:45] I trust my NASA the one that's built my
[58:48] ship to get me out of here
[58:49] I trust it when I get in it sister
[58:52] Alicia they said hit this button I hit
[58:55] that button
[58:56] they said don't touch that button oh I
[58:59] think I'll do it anyway no don't touch
[59:00] that button
[59:02] you touch that button after you've
[59:03] already launched
[59:06] what are you saying by the way we're
[59:08] astronauts we have been equipped listen
[59:10] astronauts they trained for years
[59:15] you know how they train with
[59:16] weightlessness
[59:17] in a swimming pool
[59:19] they put all that gear on with an oxygen
[59:22] mask and it replicates them being in
[59:25] space with no you know no gravity
[59:28] until I have to go down in the water to
[59:31] be able to walk on the moon well if I
[59:32] don't walk down here then I'll go walk
[59:33] up there right come on somebody if you
[59:35] don't walk down here if you don't get
[59:37] your training down here you're not gonna
[59:39] walk up there
[59:42] and I saw when the lamb opened one of
[59:44] the seals and I heard it where the noise
[59:45] of Thunder one of the four beasts said
[59:47] come and see which was the lion which
[59:49] was the powerful animal
[59:51] and I saw him Behold a white horse and
[59:53] he's telling him how to Bow this is
[59:54] Satan riding out now this is Satan
[59:56] riding out during the time that I just
[59:59] told you about the little not from God
[1:00:01] so it wasn't they were discluded over
[1:00:04] here and they were protected
[1:00:05] no it's just like job Satan probably
[1:00:08] said you protected that church
[1:00:10] let me add them I'll make them curse you
[1:00:12] and die
[1:00:14] God said okay
[1:00:16] but don't kill him
[1:00:18] I gotta let them go through all these
[1:00:19] Church ages I gotta have my people
[1:00:24] and a crown was given unto him and he
[1:00:25] went forth conquering and you know what
[1:00:27] Satan's Crown was Satan's Crown was the
[1:00:30] People Too Satan's Crown was not see or
[1:00:32] wrong Satan's Crown was a pope it was
[1:00:35] the Bishops and the Cardinals and the
[1:00:37] Hail Marys and all those different
[1:00:38] things that was their crown
[1:00:43] we all I mean what's the clown going to
[1:00:45] do any good
[1:00:46] you go stuff a crown on somebody's head
[1:00:48] that does no good even the king of
[1:00:51] England or the Queen of England you put
[1:00:53] a crown on her head does no good it's
[1:00:54] the power behind the crown
[1:00:57] it's just showing the authority when
[1:00:59] she's got an owner he's got it on but
[1:01:01] the whole authority of them putting it
[1:01:02] on him is because of the people behind
[1:01:04] them
[1:01:06] same way with me and you wasn't going
[1:01:09] this way but I'm heading in this
[1:01:10] direction anyway
[1:01:12] white means what light
[1:01:15] Satan is what now
[1:01:17] he's a minister of light
[1:01:20] but remember the Bible tells us
[1:01:22] that if your light be Darkness
[1:01:25] how great is that Darkness the light
[1:01:27] that the Pharisees and Sadducees wanted
[1:01:29] to project it was the darkest time the
[1:01:31] people in this age I am sorry the church
[1:01:35] not the bride the church the church is
[1:01:38] saying they have light
[1:01:40] but they're totally dark
[1:01:42] they say they're worshiping God and the
[1:01:44] Bible says the worship and Satan I'm not
[1:01:46] making this up
[1:01:47] all right amen and for us to be The
[1:01:51] Virtuous sin that's brought to Jesus
[1:01:52] Christ we can't fool with that guy out
[1:01:54] there
[1:01:55] we can't have that second husband we
[1:01:57] can't have that other husband we only
[1:01:59] gotta have one can't have a one marriage
[1:02:02] and divorce remember women you can't
[1:02:04] have another husband man we can
[1:02:09] well don't get quiet
[1:02:12] Jesus Christ was married to who the Jews
[1:02:15] he had to put her away
[1:02:17] give her a writing of divorcement
[1:02:19] because she committed adultery and then
[1:02:21] he married a gentile bride
[1:02:23] everybody with me
[1:02:25] well you start talking about marriage
[1:02:26] and divorce and people's fingernails
[1:02:27] start falling off
[1:02:31] you see this that Chevrolet
[1:02:34] he's going to talk about something
[1:02:38] but used of white garments as a sign of
[1:02:40] innocence and purity of Soul That's what
[1:02:42] Satan wants you to think he wants you to
[1:02:43] think you're pure
[1:02:45] when you're not
[1:02:48] the word conquer remember was Nico we
[1:02:50] were we've been talking about this the
[1:02:51] whole time because remember Nico Layton
[1:02:54] spirit is something that Jesus said to
[1:02:58] John on the Isle of Patmos he said I
[1:03:00] hate that thing
[1:03:02] I don't just not like it I hate it
[1:03:08] the Conqueror to carry off the victory
[1:03:09] and that's what Satan's going to do
[1:03:11] let's go let's get right here real quick
[1:03:12] Revelation 2 4. nevertheless look I have
[1:03:15] somewhat against it because thou has
[1:03:16] left that first eleven he's talking
[1:03:18] about the first church age the
[1:03:20] PowerHouse that we were talking about
[1:03:21] Satan got into it and he started what
[1:03:23] pulling it apart
[1:03:25] denominating it
[1:03:27] dividing them that's what Satan is doing
[1:03:30] with the bride trying to with the bride
[1:03:31] he's trying to divide us trying to pull
[1:03:34] us apart trying to fight against each
[1:03:36] other
[1:03:39] remember therefore from Wentz Thou Art
[1:03:41] fallen so you know where you fell from
[1:03:44] and repent and do the what first works
[1:03:47] what back over there in the church age
[1:03:50] that's why we can't Skip and you know
[1:03:53] you got this group it says 47 to 63 you
[1:03:55] don't have to listen to that only when
[1:03:57] the sales break now we're not that way
[1:03:58] and you know that
[1:03:59] that is a that is your that is your what
[1:04:02] that is your foundation that is all this
[1:04:04] built part of the building
[1:04:06] if you don't have that if you just try
[1:04:08] to go right here you you don't even know
[1:04:10] what you're doing
[1:04:11] you don't know what you're talking about
[1:04:13] that's agape love
[1:04:16] after
[1:04:18] those virtues are working in your life
[1:04:21] I will come quickly
[1:04:30] somebody asked what he said Remember the
[1:04:31] candlesticks
[1:04:33] each one seven
[1:04:34] he said I'm gonna remove your
[1:04:36] Candlestick if you don't change except
[1:04:39] thou repent but this thou has that thou
[1:04:41] hate us the Deeds of the Nicolaitans
[1:04:44] which I also hate
[1:04:49] listen God hates denominations
[1:04:52] he don't hate the people
[1:04:54] but when you get connected to that and
[1:04:56] you say that's your Doctrine then that
[1:04:58] is you
[1:05:00] a Baptists don't say well I'm not really
[1:05:01] a Baptist I'm really Methodist no I'm a
[1:05:04] Baptist
[1:05:05] that's when I asked that kid doesn't not
[1:05:07] too long ago I said hey
[1:05:09] Methodist going to heaven
[1:05:12] he's kind of looked at me
[1:05:15] because I said you're a Baptist
[1:05:17] y'all just think y'all are the only one
[1:05:18] that's got truth right why don't you go
[1:05:20] to Methodist Church well I don't believe
[1:05:21] everything they say
[1:05:22] I sure so they ain't going
[1:05:24] I said so I ain't going
[1:05:26] so the Pentecostals ain't going and he
[1:05:28] never had I really shouldn't have done
[1:05:30] that he just got out of school but uh I
[1:05:32] wanted him to think about it
[1:05:34] I wanted to think about when he spews
[1:05:36] out of his mouth I'm a Baptist in
[1:05:37] everybody else's faults but see you and
[1:05:40] I can stay I can stand here tonight and
[1:05:42] say we're the bride and everybody else
[1:05:44] is false because it's the truth
[1:05:46] they have some truth but they don't have
[1:05:48] the truth
[1:05:50] he'd have to near let him hear what the
[1:05:52] spirit said to the church or two him
[1:05:53] that overcome it every one of these are
[1:05:55] an overcoming
[1:05:57] who are you overcoming the preacher
[1:06:01] some of you probably would love to do
[1:06:03] that
[1:06:05] overcoming South
[1:06:08] right overcome yourself
[1:06:10] will I give to eat of the Tree of Life
[1:06:13] which in the midst of the paradise of
[1:06:15] God
[1:06:16] Satan starts with a false power let's
[1:06:18] read this right here real quick and I'll
[1:06:20] get to my point I may have to skip down
[1:06:21] through a little bit but I want to try
[1:06:23] to get done pretty quick now the mystery
[1:06:25] of the book are revealed when the seals
[1:06:26] are broken and when the seals completely
[1:06:28] are broken now look what he says when
[1:06:30] they're completely broke the time of
[1:06:31] redemption is over
[1:06:33] because the lamb left the intercession
[1:06:35] post to walk out to take his claim he
[1:06:38] was a mediator between that
[1:06:41] he was a mediator between that
[1:06:46] because look he has to mediate until you
[1:06:48] become godliness
[1:06:51] you ever thought about that he has to
[1:06:53] mediate for you until you get rid of
[1:06:55] your temperance
[1:06:59] praise God
[1:07:01] but he's standing there mediating for
[1:07:03] you till you get rid of these things and
[1:07:05] you have these working in your life
[1:07:07] then he comes down and seals that thing
[1:07:11] he was a mediator between that but when
[1:07:14] the real Revelation happens on the seals
[1:07:16] as they begin to break the lamb is
[1:07:19] coming forth from the sanctuary where
[1:07:21] that's us
[1:07:24] that's us he's coming forth from the
[1:07:26] sanctuary
[1:07:27] that says Lord prepare me to be a
[1:07:31] sanctuary
[1:07:33] pure and holy
[1:07:35] tried and true
[1:07:38] with Thanksgiving I'll be a living What
[1:07:41] sanctuary
[1:07:42] so he's coming forth from where the
[1:07:44] Lamb's not coming forth from out there
[1:07:45] he's not coming forth from this church
[1:07:47] building
[1:07:48] he's not coming forth from this
[1:07:50] oh
[1:07:55] it's done now just the words
[1:07:58] Living Bible
[1:08:01] Satan can play with this all he wants to
[1:08:03] he does anyway father son Holy Ghost is
[1:08:06] what this Bible says
[1:08:08] hell's Eternal is what this Bible says
[1:08:12] we can sprinkle is what this Bible says
[1:08:15] you know what they're preaching now in
[1:08:16] their pulpep that ain't nothing to do
[1:08:18] with God
[1:08:20] but the bride preaches the truth
[1:08:23] because that then is the power not the
[1:08:26] book you
[1:08:28] the sanctuary
[1:08:31] you read it last night in other words
[1:08:33] Revelations 5. out of the Mist and took
[1:08:36] the book
[1:08:37] now who is the book
[1:08:39] you're the book
[1:08:43] so he has no more so he's no more
[1:08:45] mediator
[1:08:46] because even they called him a lion and
[1:08:48] that's the king he's not a mediator then
[1:08:50] remember when you're sealed off I'm not
[1:08:53] talking about coming to adoption I'm
[1:08:54] talking about when we come back in a
[1:08:56] glorified body there's no we don't have
[1:08:58] to pray we don't have to go to church
[1:09:00] some of y'all really like that
[1:09:03] but if you don't come to church now you
[1:09:04] ain't gonna be a part of that church
[1:09:05] either
[1:09:07] come on somebody
[1:09:09] remember what I just read doing being
[1:09:12] obedient is better than sacrifice
[1:09:15] listen one more time I know it's a it is
[1:09:18] a sacrifice to come to church
[1:09:21] you have to really fight demons to get
[1:09:24] here
[1:09:26] y'all don't look over with your wife she
[1:09:28] ain't no like that don't do that
[1:09:31] kids Little Devils it's all their fault
[1:09:33] no it's yours you're the parent
[1:09:36] but it is a fight
[1:09:44] get back to this we talk about the
[1:09:45] actors we were talking about this the
[1:09:46] other day and some of you is looking a
[1:09:48] little strange but it's an actor because
[1:09:50] see in our intellectual mind we go and
[1:09:53] say well now brother Brown said that's
[1:09:54] what Pharisee meant Pharisee means actor
[1:09:56] I saw he's talking about here
[1:09:59] because this is one man playing the part
[1:10:03] of several people Jesus Christ God
[1:10:06] almighty is playing he's not three
[1:10:08] people
[1:10:09] he's playing the part of the three
[1:10:12] manifestations but it's the same guy
[1:10:14] moving It's Not actors
[1:10:17] as in a whole room full of actors no
[1:10:20] this one guy's playing all the parts
[1:10:23] so that actor's okay
[1:10:26] although the actors of these seals
[1:10:28] begins at the first church age now
[1:10:29] remember so you'll get the background of
[1:10:31] it thoroughly or thoroughly as possible
[1:10:32] the actors I'll place it like that
[1:10:35] because an actor is a man who changes
[1:10:36] his mask and in this act tonight we're
[1:10:38] going to see that Satan changing his
[1:10:40] mask now why is he changing his because
[1:10:42] Christ changed his
[1:10:45] he moved over in the first church age in
[1:10:47] a white righteous Church Satan takes a
[1:10:49] mask
[1:10:52] shows it to John John thinks man this is
[1:10:54] pretty cool he's riding a white horse
[1:10:56] he's conquering he's got a crown on his
[1:10:58] head it must be oh no
[1:11:01] it's the devil
[1:11:03] it's the devil
[1:11:04] Christ acting departed he did when he
[1:11:06] became from a spirit to man he only put
[1:11:09] on an actor's garment what human flesh
[1:11:11] and came down in the form of the man in
[1:11:13] order to be a kinsman redeemer
[1:11:15] you and I listen when you're born again
[1:11:17] you become you're the bride
[1:11:21] then you have to put on a new mask to go
[1:11:24] off that statue a perfect man right
[1:11:26] right it's an extra anointing but you
[1:11:28] got to put that mask on to be in the
[1:11:31] stature of Jesus Christ
[1:11:33] you can just be a Christian and and and
[1:11:36] like brother Brown said malnourished
[1:11:40] fight your way all the time but yeah
[1:11:42] you're bride
[1:11:44] but why not let's get let's be the
[1:11:46] powerhouse
[1:11:47] let's move over here and put this mask
[1:11:49] on that is the mask that what imitates
[1:11:52] that and not be an imitation be him made
[1:11:55] manifest because you know what it's not
[1:11:58] you changing the math
[1:12:00] just caught that it's not you changing
[1:12:03] the mask it's God saying hey come over
[1:12:05] here I want you to play this part come
[1:12:06] over here I want you to play this part
[1:12:08] hey come over here you're my bride I
[1:12:10] want you to play this part
[1:12:12] amen
[1:12:14] because where's our kinsman redeemer
[1:12:16] it's inside of you
[1:12:19] as sea life comes from the body you are
[1:12:22] better be careful
[1:12:25] you have the Kinsmen Redeemer you have
[1:12:27] to give it out
[1:12:29] so you become a part of that kinsman
[1:12:31] redeemer
[1:12:33] oh get quiet with me if you want to but
[1:12:36] if you've got Jesus Christ inside of you
[1:12:38] the only Jesus Christ the people going
[1:12:40] to see is who through
[1:12:41] you
[1:12:42] you
[1:12:45] aren't we Jesus Christ May manifest in
[1:12:47] another form called The Bride well that
[1:12:48] kinsman redeemer part is inside of you
[1:12:52] that's the reason they all are in
[1:12:53] Parables or symbols the way are they
[1:12:55] hear like beast beast beasts and these
[1:12:57] actors begin in the first church age so
[1:12:59] they begin down here in the first church
[1:13:00] age as I was just saying
[1:13:02] trying to look he said there's a great
[1:13:04] mess up comes along what they didn't
[1:13:07] follow the script
[1:13:09] the script is the Bible it was laid out
[1:13:12] in the first church Aid
[1:13:14] they had the full word of God the
[1:13:16] prophet said but what did they do they
[1:13:19] let another actor they let another
[1:13:22] person
[1:13:24] come in and say I'm the Pope I'm God in
[1:13:28] human flesh
[1:13:29] no he was the devil in human flesh
[1:13:33] and you know what you and I were until
[1:13:35] we were born again
[1:13:37] we were the devil in human flesh
[1:13:39] so why can't we be God in human flesh
[1:13:41] when we get to New Birth
[1:13:43] what's so strange about that
[1:13:45] Christ reveals itself to the seven
[1:13:47] Church ages to those Church ages there's
[1:13:49] a great mess up comes along then at the
[1:13:52] end of the church age right here where
[1:13:53] we're at the seventh Angel's message is
[1:13:55] to pick up those lost Mysteries and give
[1:13:58] it what give it to the church
[1:14:00] not keep it give it to me and you
[1:14:04] but not then revealed in their true
[1:14:06] State what back then
[1:14:08] it is now
[1:14:10] revealed and it's true
[1:14:12] condition look brother Brown said
[1:14:13] there's a mystery that goes with that
[1:14:15] writer
[1:14:18] and we know who that is so guess what
[1:14:20] there's not a mystery anymore
[1:14:22] we know he's a white he wants to be a
[1:14:24] white righteous church we know he wants
[1:14:25] to get on a white horse we know he wants
[1:14:27] to imitate God
[1:14:30] we know where he's at
[1:14:33] hey man
[1:14:34] all right let's read this real quick and
[1:14:36] we'll and we'll close
[1:14:38] who can find a virtuous woman
[1:14:40] for her prices far above rubies like I
[1:14:42] said before this is Solomon talking
[1:14:44] about his mom
[1:14:46] his mother that went through
[1:14:48] a king taking her
[1:14:50] and violating her and getting her
[1:14:52] pregnant
[1:14:53] and then having her husband killed
[1:14:56] you don't think she didn't know that
[1:14:58] yeah she knew that
[1:14:59] so she knew though that she had to
[1:15:02] accept
[1:15:03] she was fixing to go live with a
[1:15:04] murderer
[1:15:05] that murdered her own husband
[1:15:08] that's why I'm telling you folks you
[1:15:10] never see in the Bible where God
[1:15:12] condemned Bathsheba
[1:15:15] he sent that Prophet to David he didn't
[1:15:17] send that Prophet to Bathsheba he didn't
[1:15:19] call her a and a prostitute
[1:15:23] he called David a murderer and a liar
[1:15:26] and he also called him a thief
[1:15:29] remember the story
[1:15:30] stole that one lamb David said bring him
[1:15:33] here we'll kill him well I'll take him
[1:15:36] apart myself
[1:15:37] Nathan said
[1:15:38] you're the guy David
[1:15:41] and all I'm sure David just flushed even
[1:15:44] being a mighty king you know what being
[1:15:45] a king if he was of the wrong
[1:15:47] breed
[1:15:49] brother John he just said kill that
[1:15:51] Prophet bring me another one
[1:15:53] that man's lying no he knew he was
[1:15:55] caught
[1:15:56] he knew he did that and he knew he
[1:15:59] couldn't cover it up no more
[1:16:01] and then God Nathan said David
[1:16:05] I prayed for you
[1:16:08] Thou Art the man but I prayed for you
[1:16:10] thank God we had a prophet pray for us
[1:16:12] in the end time
[1:16:14] he prayed that we make it just like
[1:16:16] Jesus prayed in John 17 that we make it
[1:16:19] in this world
[1:16:20] watching Proverbs 12 verse 4 says a
[1:16:23] virtuous woman is a crown to her husband
[1:16:26] now look I'm not talking about a
[1:16:27] virtuous woman you because let me tell
[1:16:29] you something
[1:16:30] um
[1:16:32] this morning I was reading some quotes a
[1:16:34] little bit on marriage and divorce but
[1:16:35] brother Ralph said now sisters if you
[1:16:38] dress wrong
[1:16:42] oh I'm sorry I said marriage and
[1:16:44] divorce sorry about that
[1:16:46] you say that and everybody goes
[1:16:51] let's open up a little bit
[1:16:54] brother Brown said Sisters You Can Be
[1:16:56] Lily white to your husband you can claim
[1:16:58] your virginity
[1:17:00] on the night of your wedding he said but
[1:17:02] if you put yourself out in front of a
[1:17:04] man and he's lusted after you he said
[1:17:06] you have committed adultery already with
[1:17:09] that person
[1:17:10] wow
[1:17:12] wow
[1:17:15] so listen folks I'm telling you without
[1:17:17] the grace of God we're all dead
[1:17:19] without the grace of God there's nobody
[1:17:21] could preach there's nobody could teach
[1:17:23] there's nobody could be a deacon
[1:17:25] only a few
[1:17:27] one or two I
[1:17:31] thank God for Grace
[1:17:33] thank God that brother Brown stood one
[1:17:34] day and said
[1:17:35] don't do that no more
[1:17:38] if you ever do it again said man I said
[1:17:40] you're right in other words you're out
[1:17:41] from under this Grace don't make it
[1:17:43] greasy Grace
[1:17:45] don't make a greasy Grace folks I'm
[1:17:46] telling you don't make it greasy Grace
[1:17:48] brother Brian said you get one shot
[1:17:51] as long as you don't do it no more
[1:17:52] you're good why because we needed it
[1:17:55] every Church what Paul had one didn't he
[1:17:58] Moses had one didn't he
[1:18:02] Jesus called a woman well he didn't but
[1:18:04] they called her into acts of adultery
[1:18:06] according to the Torah she was to be
[1:18:08] stoned and killed right there
[1:18:11] but what Jesus do same thing with Rahab
[1:18:15] he just killed all her accusers
[1:18:18] he said first one of you has no sin cast
[1:18:21] the first stone well he got rid of them
[1:18:22] and he said lady
[1:18:23] were your accusers they've already left
[1:18:27] well he said I don't accuse you because
[1:18:29] I didn't see it happen
[1:18:32] right that's one of the reasons this
[1:18:33] quote that you're The Virtuous sin with
[1:18:35] pride of Jesus Christ because Jesus
[1:18:36] didn't see
[1:18:38] do that
[1:18:39] he heard your voice
[1:18:42] of repentance
[1:18:43] and he knew your heart think about David
[1:18:46] David was a man now listen nobody in the
[1:18:48] Bible
[1:18:50] nobody in the Bible God ever stood up
[1:18:53] and said this is a man after my own
[1:18:56] heart
[1:18:59] a murderer
[1:19:01] a liar
[1:19:03] a thief
[1:19:04] an adulterer and that would be
[1:19:06] premeditated murder because he wanted
[1:19:08] him dead
[1:19:09] it wasn't just an accident
[1:19:11] but God said that's a man after my own
[1:19:14] heart
[1:19:16] he saw the heart of David he didn't see
[1:19:19] the left part of David he didn't see the
[1:19:21] humanity part of David he saw that David
[1:19:23] cried out if you'll notice in the Bible
[1:19:25] he lays out on the stones
[1:19:28] and cries and prays for days
[1:19:30] when that kid gets ready to die he had a
[1:19:33] repentant heart
[1:19:34] and God forgave him and made it so clear
[1:19:37] that now he promised David this
[1:19:41] adulterer this liar this murder this put
[1:19:43] your name in there
[1:19:46] he's going to have a name over in the
[1:19:47] Millennium called the son of
[1:19:50] David
[1:19:52] he thought so much to David he's
[1:19:54] carrying that lineage on over to the son
[1:19:56] of David which will be Jesus Christ
[1:19:59] and David's going to be going thank you
[1:20:01] God
[1:20:02] for Grace
[1:20:05] Proverbs 12 let's see a virtuous woman
[1:20:06] is a crown
[1:20:08] a crown
[1:20:10] a virtuous woman now the bride
[1:20:13] is a crown to her husband Jesus Christ
[1:20:17] but she didn't make it the same as
[1:20:19] rottenness in his bones
[1:20:22] so we look at the ones that we looked at
[1:20:23] the other day Rahab
[1:20:26] she was not a virgin
[1:20:30] she married an Israeli General
[1:20:32] they had Boaz
[1:20:34] Boaz was a mighty man you know what he
[1:20:36] didn't I don't believe he turned around
[1:20:37] and said my mom was just an old
[1:20:40] no he loves his mama
[1:20:42] she got trapped in it come on people I'm
[1:20:44] dropped by us we got trapped in this
[1:20:48] but remember I promise you want to say
[1:20:50] when Rahab married the Israeli General
[1:20:53] she didn't go horn again
[1:20:57] she became a virtuous woman
[1:21:00] she asked number one she asked salmon
[1:21:02] she said forgive me
[1:21:04] he said I'll take you
[1:21:07] because I feel that there's something
[1:21:09] there between us I'll take you
[1:21:12] ohaz was born type of Christ
[1:21:16] a type of a Kinsmen Redeemer
[1:21:19] then you know what Boaz made Roots she
[1:21:21] wasn't a virgin either
[1:21:23] we'll get to talk about this in marriage
[1:21:25] and divorce maybe later on but look Ruth
[1:21:27] was not a virgin
[1:21:29] she had had a previous husband
[1:21:32] but according to the law he died
[1:21:34] so she can marry again but she wasn't a
[1:21:37] virgin
[1:21:38] so she marries Boaz Boaz says Thou Art a
[1:21:42] virtuous woman the whole city knows
[1:21:44] you're right here root 3 verse 11. now
[1:21:46] my daughter fear not I will do to thee
[1:21:49] all that thou requires for all the city
[1:21:51] my people doth know that thou art a
[1:21:53] virtuous woman
[1:21:55] there's a whole city where you live know
[1:21:57] that you're a virtuous person
[1:21:58] let me ask that question one more time
[1:22:00] does the whole city
[1:22:02] your neighbors your friends
[1:22:04] do they know you're different
[1:22:09] or do you act different
[1:22:11] out there than you do here
[1:22:14] so Ruth mayor's Boaz
[1:22:16] and they have Obed
[1:22:19] oh bad
[1:22:20] how's Jesse
[1:22:22] and Jesse has David
[1:22:26] and then David
[1:22:28] has a couple of wives
[1:22:31] hmm
[1:22:33] David David has another wife her name is
[1:22:35] Abigail
[1:22:37] everybody in just a second we'll have a
[1:22:39] little history here her name was Abigail
[1:22:41] she was married to neighbor
[1:22:44] which was his name was a fool
[1:22:47] right his name was the his neighbors
[1:22:50] right the neighbor he was a fool
[1:22:55] he died
[1:22:57] so she married David
[1:23:00] hmm
[1:23:01] I hope you think about that a little bit
[1:23:05] we were married to a fool one time
[1:23:09] his name was the devil
[1:23:11] but when God killed him
[1:23:13] we married the right one
[1:23:16] we married our David the real David the
[1:23:19] real David that what took Bathsheba and
[1:23:22] at one time he lusted after at one time
[1:23:24] and and the story even goes more about
[1:23:26] Bathsheba a little bit deeper if you
[1:23:28] want to understand she was and this is
[1:23:30] what the story we look at the story and
[1:23:32] we go well now she knew the the palace
[1:23:36] was right here
[1:23:38] up above
[1:23:40] and and David you know David the king
[1:23:44] he has his little Entourage and they may
[1:23:46] blow this you know David's out on his
[1:23:48] porch looking around and
[1:23:51] and she's down there going
[1:23:58] no
[1:24:01] according to
[1:24:02] Jewish tradition again
[1:24:05] Bathsheba had just finished
[1:24:08] her period
[1:24:10] and according to the law you're supposed
[1:24:13] to wash
[1:24:15] she was not up there lusting after David
[1:24:17] she was not up there trying to make
[1:24:18] herself naked she was trying to keep
[1:24:20] herself clean anybody got anything since
[1:24:22] out of this she's trying to keep make
[1:24:24] herself clean according to the to the to
[1:24:26] the Torah according to the Old Testament
[1:24:28] she wasn't up there washing herself to
[1:24:30] you know flashing David
[1:24:33] she probably wasn't paying the attention
[1:24:34] because she just went through her seven
[1:24:36] days and she had to go through a washing
[1:24:37] of purification before she could because
[1:24:40] remember
[1:24:41] when David finds her like that he sees
[1:24:43] her and he tells the guy go get her
[1:24:46] well she gets pregnant
[1:24:48] right after
[1:24:50] everybody understand what I'm saying so
[1:24:52] it kind of makes sense it's not in the
[1:24:54] Bible but I don't think about she but
[1:24:56] nowhere in the Bible Bathsheba is called
[1:24:57] a prostitute nowhere in the Bible it
[1:25:00] says God has has cursed Bathsheba he's
[1:25:02] cursing David David's one that's got the
[1:25:05] problem all right so Bathsheba then has
[1:25:09] to learn to love David
[1:25:12] you
[1:25:13] yeah right right right right
[1:25:16] that's learning to love Jesus Christ
[1:25:22] she learned to love the man that had her
[1:25:24] first wife her first husband killed
[1:25:27] and God cursed that first baby because
[1:25:29] of that Union because of David not
[1:25:32] because of Bathsheba
[1:25:35] but she had to overcome all that scars
[1:25:38] everybody with me today
[1:25:40] she had to overcome her scars
[1:25:43] and her disappointments
[1:25:45] she had to overcome
[1:25:47] that King
[1:25:50] that murdered her husband
[1:25:53] and that cursed her first child
[1:25:56] she overcome that and learned to love
[1:26:00] the Lord Jesus
[1:26:02] now we know David but you know you David
[1:26:05] was the Rascal but we're talking about
[1:26:06] the devil here
[1:26:08] we were trapped into this just like she
[1:26:10] was trapped into that there's no way she
[1:26:11] could get out of it
[1:26:14] if you just if you told the king no you
[1:26:16] could be killed
[1:26:17] so she was just taken in and David did
[1:26:19] what he wanted to with her but remember
[1:26:22] he learned to love her too because God
[1:26:24] spoke to David said you're gonna have a
[1:26:25] son
[1:26:26] and he's going to sit on your throne
[1:26:27] because remember David had a whole bunch
[1:26:29] of sons
[1:26:30] he said Solomon from this Union there's
[1:26:33] no Town brother about how many how many
[1:26:35] virtuous beautiful virgins that he
[1:26:38] married before that
[1:26:40] he picks this one
[1:26:42] to bring Solomon why because he picked
[1:26:45] me and you to bring Jesus Christ through
[1:26:47] our stupidity through all thy wrongs for
[1:26:50] all thy whoredoms do all my things that
[1:26:52] we did wrong he wants to bring the bride
[1:26:54] through this right here
[1:26:56] Lord man
[1:26:59] listen this
[1:27:01] will get ready musicians come on a
[1:27:03] virtuous woman cares for her family
[1:27:06] she's a hard worker
[1:27:08] while she toils Faithfully in meeting
[1:27:10] the needs of her own family she also
[1:27:12] doesn't forget to help the other needy
[1:27:14] people God brings across her path now
[1:27:16] I'm not talking about a woman I'm
[1:27:18] talking about the bride all right don't
[1:27:19] like me and you
[1:27:21] a virtuous woman also takes the time to
[1:27:24] look after her own health
[1:27:27] and be a good Steward of her body
[1:27:32] we are the body of Christ
[1:27:36] so our virtuous woman meaning applies to
[1:27:40] the heart
[1:27:41] and then to every area area of life
[1:27:46] the bottom line is a virtuous woman goes
[1:27:48] into strength well we talk about virtue
[1:27:50] the strength of the Lord and Faithfully
[1:27:53] completes whatever task that's a capital
[1:27:56] H so that's Jesus Christ he has for her
[1:28:00] to do when a person is described as
[1:28:02] having virtue it is seen as a quality
[1:28:04] that sets one apart from everyone else
[1:28:06] in character
[1:28:09] hello come on
[1:28:11] strength and morality
[1:28:14] it is a common characteristic that can
[1:28:16] be found within the mindsets of several
[1:28:19] women in the Bible from Ruth to Esther
[1:28:21] you got to remember one thing do you all
[1:28:23] know that Esther was not a virgin either
[1:28:27] one night with a king she spent the
[1:28:28] night with the king before she married
[1:28:29] him before he married her
[1:28:31] good people
[1:28:33] read your Bible
[1:28:35] Ruth to Esther to Mary
[1:28:38] as well as described of others through
[1:28:40] countless
[1:28:41] verses
[1:28:42] come on
[1:28:46] I want you to read I'm going to read
[1:28:47] this quote right here and this is
[1:28:48] this will hit us right between us
[1:28:51] let's stand our feet
[1:28:53] brother random
[1:28:55] he said I'm waiting three or four
[1:28:56] minutes
[1:28:58] let me get something short here maybe
[1:29:00] I can't give over completely to Jesus
[1:29:03] have I an evil spirit
[1:29:06] the question questions and answers
[1:29:08] let me just spend the rest of time on
[1:29:10] that there you can't surrender to Jesus
[1:29:13] question mark
[1:29:14] they don't see I don't know if it's a
[1:29:16] man or a woman I couldn't tell which it
[1:29:18] is God knows
[1:29:19] you can't surrender to Jesus why
[1:29:22] what's the matter if you are a woman
[1:29:24] don't you have to surrender surrender to
[1:29:27] your husband to be a wife
[1:29:29] surrender all you are listen to this a

[1:29:44] a little lady when you're married
[1:29:47] virtuous fought all your life to stay

[1:35:04] amen you love the Lord
[1:35:07] he's good to us isn't he
[1:35:10] this is truly a time for us to unwrap
[1:35:14] some gifts
[1:35:16] some gifts of the Spirit
[1:35:18] we can unwrap all the gifts we want to
[1:35:20] and get toys and guns and knives and
[1:35:23] shouldn't have said guns food pulpep
[1:35:26] they might be listening to them I think
[1:35:29] we're a terrorist or something
[1:35:31] but we get all these gifts but let's
[1:35:33] have some let's open some gifts of the
[1:35:35] Spirit
[1:35:36] some wisdom some Faith some knowledge
[1:35:38] maybe sometimes an interpretation that'd
[1:35:41] be all right with me some prophecy
[1:35:43] it lays inside of you folks it lays
[1:35:46] inside of every one of us
[1:35:48] the Bible tells us to exercise
[1:35:51] your gift just like you exercise your
[1:35:53] muscles and you exercise that fork up to
[1:35:56] your mouth
[1:35:58] come on
[1:35:59] we ought to exercise the gifts that's in
[1:36:01] the Bible well that was for another day
[1:36:02] no I thought that day was this day
[1:36:05] well what if it see there you go what if
[1:36:09] it don't happen what if that nod what if
[1:36:10] are we going to keep doubting
[1:36:13] lay hands on the seat that shall recover
[1:36:15] that's what the Bible said you don't
[1:36:16] have to shake them pull them you don't
[1:36:17] even tell them you're praying for them
[1:36:19] [Music]
[1:36:21] you know what brother Brown said the
[1:36:22] best the greatest thing you can say to
[1:36:24] somebody what is it God bless you
[1:36:27] God bless you now we we say that
[1:36:29] sometimes in repetition but we really I
[1:36:32] believe the bride really means it
[1:36:33] because when I say God bless you Sister
[1:36:35] Anna I want God to bless her
[1:36:37] I want literally God to come down and
[1:36:39] bless you for whatever you need and even
[1:36:41] some of the things you probably don't
[1:36:42] even ask for he'll give it to you he's a
[1:36:44] good god brother Brown said don't ask
[1:36:46] for little things he said ask for the
[1:36:48] big things so I'm gonna ask for gifts to
[1:36:50] break out in the church I'm going to ask
[1:36:52] for us to grow up this statue of perfect
[1:36:53] man get better in God
[1:36:56] oh and you know what we have New Year's
[1:36:58] resolutions coming up right
[1:37:00] let's have some New Year's revelation
[1:37:04] because of Revelation you're not two
[1:37:07] months later forget about the yeah come
[1:37:09] on somebody
[1:37:11] you've never done that have you never
[1:37:13] met oh okay
[1:37:15] we make New Year's resolutions I'm gonna
[1:37:17] quit eating
[1:37:20] maybe for two or three weeks till that
[1:37:22] bacon comes off the grill
[1:37:25] [Music]
[1:37:27] come on now
[1:37:29] I'm not gonna eat ice cream that's kind
[1:37:31] of liking people for Lent
[1:37:33] then people that give up lent well I
[1:37:35] give up lent all the time I'm not eating
[1:37:37] hummus ever
[1:37:38] so that's easy for me to give up during
[1:37:41] Lent
[1:37:42] hey man
[1:37:44] well now that's not what Lynn's about
[1:37:46] really it's about giving up something
[1:37:47] you like
[1:37:49] uh in other words to fast and pray I'm
[1:37:51] not trying to make a joke out of it but
[1:37:52] that's what we do as human beings we saw
[1:37:54] it's easy for us to not like something
[1:37:56] we don't like
[1:37:58] but what about trying to live this
[1:38:00] when we don't want to have Godly
[1:38:02] Temperance come on somebody we're human
[1:38:04] when we don't want to have so much
[1:38:07] godliness uh and brotherly kindness to
[1:38:10] love somebody that really hates you I
[1:38:12] mean really hates you
[1:38:14] and you love them anyway
[1:38:16] that's what we're coming to folks this
[1:38:18] year we're coming to that we're going up
[1:38:20] that statue of perfect man
[1:38:21] you better get on the ladder because
[1:38:23] here we go
