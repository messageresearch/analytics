[0:00] 2023 at the Christian Assembly oh Hatchi
[0:03] uh would like to invite you to our
[0:04] annual Memorial meetings May 26th and
[0:06] 27th at 7 and also 28th to 10 I think
[0:11] that's it come on sister Rebecca God
[0:13] bless you
[0:17] all hey man uh feel like I've been up
[0:20] here in a while but um Satan always
[0:23] fighting me he'll fight me before I do
[0:24] something and after I do it so I figure
[0:26] I might well just do it and just deal
[0:28] with it but um
[0:30] I just want to give a quick testimony it
[0:32] happened a while ago and
[0:34] um sometime I don't feel worthy to get
[0:36] up here sometime I feel rough you know
[0:38] like when you've been out in the world
[0:39] for so long you the devil just make you
[0:40] feel rough like you got this Edge on you
[0:42] sometimes like you just rough you know
[0:44] and so I'm just trying to overcome all
[0:47] that and just let God have his will in
[0:49] my life and um make sure it's about him
[0:51] and not about
[0:52] me um this testimony a brother told it
[0:57] but it goes along with my testimony it
[0:59] was a brother that he was getting ready
[1:01] to lose his house and the banks were
[1:03] going to take it and so he had to meet
[1:06] up with his
[1:07] lawyer um the next day he had to meet
[1:10] with his lawyer but that next day also
[1:12] was the same day church service was
[1:13] going on so uh he called his preacher
[1:17] and was like look they're getting ready
[1:18] to take my house and I have to meet with
[1:21] this lawyer today you know so I'm not
[1:23] going to be able to come to church so
[1:25] the brother said the preacher said well
[1:26] come on to church anyway you know put
[1:27] God first God will take care of all that
[1:29] so the brother was in like a you know
[1:30] Bond like brother I got to meet with
[1:32] this lawyer I'm about to lose my house
[1:34] so um anyway the preacher persuaded him
[1:37] just come to church it's a true story
[1:38] just come to church brother God to take
[1:40] care of the rest so the brother went
[1:42] ahead and came to
[1:44] church well the next day the bank called
[1:47] him and he found out they paid off the
[1:49] house nobody understood how it happened
[1:51] why it went that way but the bank ended
[1:53] up taking care of his whole house
[1:54] payment so thank the Lord for that and
[1:57] um it goes with my testimony which is um
[2:01] I had a toothache probably a couple
[2:02] weeks back when um when we had the guest
[2:04] speaker I had a toothache I mean I was
[2:06] trying to sleep on the top of my head
[2:07] just to get rid of this toothache so
[2:11] um I I made a I made it my mission to go
[2:14] to the dentist the next day and uh they
[2:17] did a examine everything my gums were so
[2:19] swollen that it was like the the size of
[2:22] a walnut it was so swollen I couldn't
[2:24] talk I couldn't do anything it was
[2:26] throbbing in my head under my neck back
[2:28] of everything was just out of whack for
[2:30] me so uh they looked at it and was like
[2:32] wow you know we got to get this done so
[2:34] come in the next day which was Saturday
[2:36] and um they told me come in they'll
[2:38] they'll take care of it take it out so
[2:40] um that next day happened to be when we
[2:43] had the guest speaker that Saturday so
[2:45] um I was like well yeah so I came in I
[2:47] went to the dentist and they said um we
[2:49] can take it out just come back at 2:00
[2:52] and um we'll take care of it for you
[2:54] okay that was the same time my brother
[2:56] Gary was in town and um I was like well
[2:59] yeah yeah I mean this makes sense I got
[3:00] to get this I got to get this taken care
[3:02] of I can't bear it you know and I'm
[3:04] sitting in the car like well okay my
[3:06] appointment at 3: I'll just ask Gary and
[3:08] John to you know take my mom to church
[3:10] with them cuz my mom was standing in my
[3:12] house at the time I said Gary can pick
[3:13] her up she can go to church with them
[3:14] I'll just take care of my tooth well a
[3:17] little small voice was like well you
[3:18] remember that preacher that went to
[3:19] church and God took care of the rest so
[3:21] I said maybe I just yeah I'm I'm going
[3:23] to go that route God can take care of
[3:24] this toothache you know just a little
[3:26] bit of Faith but I'm like God can take
[3:27] care of this so um came to church I
[3:30] decided to come to church and just bear
[3:32] with there I was still in pain but I
[3:33] said I'm going to just go to church and
[3:34] I believe God can take care of this
[3:35] toothache because I don't want to miss
[3:37] it so I came to church I got prayed for
[3:39] I came over here and got prayed for her
[3:40] I asked brother wait for a prayer cloth
[3:42] and I set it right on the right on the
[3:44] um the tooth that was killing me pretty
[3:46] much and uh I sat in the back still in
[3:49] pain and everything but I was like God
[3:51] going to take care of it somehow I went
[3:53] downstairs and um me and the sisters
[3:54] were fellowshipping and stuff I felt
[3:57] that swelling going down uh while we
[3:59] were talking
[4:00] little by little I felt that thing going
[4:02] down whatever was inside of it I felt it
[4:04] coming out it was coming out it was
[4:05] going down I was like oh my God it's
[4:07] happening I even had to tell some of the
[4:09] sisters excuse me but let me give yall
[4:11] this testimony that just happened so I
[4:13] just wanted to share that it was um it
[4:15] happened a couple weeks ago but it was
[4:16] on my heart and I was you know debating
[4:18] if I wanted to come up but God is good
[4:19] and
[4:25] put wonderful wonderful testimony s
[4:28] Rebecca I think that's a perfect example
[4:31] of what brother brandom said if you
[4:32] don't have faith for a
[4:34] toothache Faith puts you in action you
[4:36] see that she she she put that prayer
[4:39] cloth on her and she just believed I'm
[4:41] going to church I'm want to listen to
[4:42] the service and has Faith took care of
[4:44] the rest I think that's a good example
[4:46] of that so we just thank God for healing
[4:48] that toothache amen praise the Lord

[27:04] you you said to do it in spirit and in
[27:07] truth so father we pray that our brother
[27:11] has sung the songs and did all the
[27:14] preliminary things that we need to do
[27:17] Lord now I pray as the prophet say he's
[27:20] he's switching into a different
[27:22] anointing to preach so that the people
[27:25] can hear what's you've got to say to
[27:28] them not me Lord I pray that you would
[27:31] open our eyes and open our
[27:35] ears and for those that don't have a
[27:37] heart that's full of you I pray Lord
[27:39] that you'd save their
[27:42] soul lord we still are in this in the
[27:45] business of getting people saved we know
[27:49] that this statue of a perfect man is
[27:51] more for the mature uh as we say adult
[27:55] Christians not in age but in in in
[27:58] stature Lord don't forget the ones that
[28:01] are that are struggling and trying down
[28:03] at Faith Lord just reach and and grab
[28:07] them Lord and and hug them up and and
[28:10] Lord may they do as as Jacob did of
[28:15] old just wrestle with you all
[28:18] night and get it all fought
[28:21] out and Lord Jacob walked
[28:25] different when you left him
[28:28] but he looked and saw a lad and saw
[28:30] angels ascending and
[28:33] descending up into heaven and coming
[28:36] back lord I pray that that's what we'll
[28:38] see in this stature of a perfect man
[28:41] Lord we see the Angels ascending and
[28:42] descending back and forth but you came
[28:45] on the scene Jacob didn't wrestle with
[28:47] an angel he wrestled with you and Lord
[28:51] you touched
[28:52] him Lord Jesus I pray that you'd touch
[28:55] us today touch us all in a special way
[28:58] that maybe you've never touched us
[29:00] before that we'll be more like you Lord
[29:04] that we'll be more patient and will be
[29:08] more temperent with the people and Lord
[29:11] have strength to give that virtue out
[29:15] and Lord the knowledge not the kind that
[29:18] puffeth up but the knowledge that we we
[29:21] know as the prophet of God said we read
[29:23] it we know that little
[29:25] nod that when it comes to a place we
[29:28] know what's going on we know that you're
[29:31] on the scene father we pray now be with
[29:34] the ones that are sick that are not here
[29:35] Lord the ones that are listening in I
[29:37] pray that you'd be with each one be with
[29:39] brother Dale Lord now is his birthday we
[29:41] pray that you'd just give him any more
[29:43] and forgive us of our sins and bless us
[29:45] Lord take care of us to further in this
[29:47] service Jesus name we
[29:49] pray
[29:51] amen all right part 102 so in the
[29:53] beginning was the word word was with God
[29:55] and the Word was God we're going to get
[29:56] the godliness and maybe get into
[29:57] brotherly kindness a little bit and that
[30:00] word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[30:03] and we beheld his glory the glory of the
[30:05] only begotten of the father full of what
[30:08] Grace and Truth Grace and Truth all
[30:11] right as we were talking this
[30:14] morning you don't know anything about
[30:16] Grace until you get born again you just
[30:19] don't you can't cuz you're standing born
[30:21] again and your sins are being chopped
[30:24] off your sins are being done away with
[30:26] and under the grace of God we are as we
[30:28] were talking this morning as we'll speak
[30:29] a little bit more about how God's washed
[30:32] us up God's took us and took the
[30:33] wrinkles out he's took the spots out
[30:35] he's took the sin out he's took the part
[30:37] of humanity that we struggle with and
[30:40] he's took all that out all right and
[30:43] what do you do he put him
[30:45] inside and besides this giving all
[30:47] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[30:48] The Virtue knowledge knowledge
[30:49] Temperance Temperance patience and
[30:51] patience godliness now we continue on
[30:53] and godliness brotherly kindness we're
[30:56] going to spend a little while follow on
[30:57] brotherly kindness cuz I got a few
[30:58] Avenues I want to go there and to
[31:01] brotherly kindness charity we're almost
[31:03] up to the Capstone then we can start in
[31:06] the seals and the different things and
[31:07] we talk about the son of man which we
[31:09] started 10 and something Services ago so
[31:12] 1 Timothy 316 and without controversy
[31:15] great is the mystery of godliness God
[31:18] was manifest In the Flesh justified in
[31:19] the spirit seene of angels preached unto
[31:22] the Gentiles believed on in the world
[31:24] and received up into Glory you may be SE
[31:27] Lord as his Blessing for the reading of
[31:29] his word now we know that word we look
[31:31] cont without controversy or without
[31:33] Strife or without dispute or without a
[31:35] quarrel there's nothing that you can say
[31:38] that's going to change the word of God
[31:40] so guess what we have to do we have to
[31:42] change ourself to the word of God not
[31:45] away from it all right uh I have my own
[31:48] thoughts you have your own thoughts but
[31:50] but those thoughts have got to do as we
[31:52] were talking in knowledge that knowledge
[31:54] is not worldly knowledge that knowledge
[31:56] is not as as uh Chris was talking this
[31:58] weekend about the Hubble telescope and
[32:01] that other one that's named after that
[32:02] other guy that can see a million miles
[32:04] that's okay that's man's natural
[32:08] knowledge and they're getting into
[32:10] artificial intelligence and all these
[32:12] different things where a computer
[32:14] supposedly thinks for us well well
[32:16] praise God I need it every once in a
[32:18] while but uh you know I mean you can be
[32:21] you can be talking about a buying a
[32:23] Chevrolet car and what pops up about 5
[32:26] minutes later on your phone
[32:27] there's an
[32:30] ad for some Chevrolet place
[32:34] now that's kind of weird and then you've
[32:37] got I know the computer guys you got
[32:39] algorithms and all these different
[32:40] things that if you continue to go down
[32:42] this road with something you get
[32:44] inundated with all these uh uh ads and
[32:47] popups and all these things well that's
[32:49] artificial intelligence but what about
[32:51] the intelligence of God that takes us
[32:53] past that million miles listen if you're
[32:55] born again today a million miles means
[32:57] nothing to you a million miles is just
[32:59] like that because you've travel like I
[33:01] thought hund and something Thousand
[33:02] Miles a second then guess what million
[33:05] miles are just like going from here to
[33:06] Commerce all right so we see it that way
[33:09] and that's to me that's the knowledge
[33:11] but look at this right here so forn
[33:13] knowledge we talk about the forn
[33:15] knowledge of God and I really want you
[33:16] we may cover predestination again a
[33:19] little bit later on but brother Dale's
[33:22] covered it a 100 times and we ought to
[33:23] be pretty settled in it that those he
[33:25] forne so for knowledge is first if you
[33:27] put for knowledge first uh don't get me
[33:30] wrong for but forget about
[33:32] predestination because predestination is
[33:34] like brother Bram said it's a bad word
[33:36] to use in a untrained crowd because
[33:38] predestination does mean
[33:41] predetermined
[33:43] Destiny all right and that is a tube and
[33:46] that is that's not where he pulls you
[33:48] through though and you don't have a
[33:49] choice that's because he saw brother
[33:51] George what you would do therefore he
[33:54] could
[33:55] predetermine this whole world
[33:57] to me that's so simple not that he
[34:00] predestined first and then by then then
[34:03] he used his for knowledge no he uses for
[34:05] knowledge first because it's called for
[34:08] okay knowledge all right so to me that's
[34:11] just as simple as it can be and then we
[34:13] have to keep it separated though when we
[34:16] talk about the genes of God and the gene
[34:18] seed of God and all these different
[34:19] things that people are are talking about
[34:22] in the message and realize one thing's
[34:24] for sure when the prophet of God makes a
[34:26] statement he's in the mind of God and
[34:29] then he's over here talking to Sinners
[34:30] so there's two different things as we
[34:32] were talking about this morning he's not
[34:33] saying two different things now brother
[34:36] R is not that confused same way we're
[34:38] talking about with Daniel 70 weeks they
[34:39] said well I've got these quotes and
[34:41] we've got these quotes and they just
[34:42] fight each other this message don't
[34:44] fight each other the message is right
[34:47] you just don't understand and I don't
[34:50] understand what's going on until the
[34:52] Lord what gives us holy ghost
[34:55] knowledge and you know what by for
[34:59] knowledge God knew that this group of
[35:02] people now I'm going to say it this
[35:05] group of people inside this building
[35:07] today by for knowledge God knew you
[35:10] would want good teaching correct
[35:12] teaching and not another Ministry or you
[35:15] would be somewhere
[35:16] else I mean really you'd be a lot of
[35:19] people are built though they need
[35:20] somebody that's you know up and down the
[35:21] aisles and running back and forth and
[35:23] screaming and hollering and just you
[35:25] know preaching God s a prophet
[35:27] and you know be a good Christian and
[35:28] love each other and that's okay but what
[35:31] about
[35:33] this what about more add to I want the
[35:37] add to part and that's kind of what
[35:39] we're all well you know we're we're born
[35:41] underneath that and and you know
[35:43] sometimes we we as ministers we we do we
[35:46] like people to be emotional and not be
[35:48] you know sitting back with their finger
[35:50] stuck in there anyway um nose or
[35:54] wherever more but um and not be sleepy
[35:57] and try to be attentive but we know the
[36:00] the um old man said one time he said the
[36:02] mind can only endure what the backside
[36:04] can so um
[36:07] yeah the mind can only comprehend what
[36:10] the back side can endure so we know that
[36:12] we have to endure but listen you have to
[36:14] fight fight be brave against all evil
[36:18] why fight fight it don't bring your
[36:21] pillow and your blanket and your cold
[36:23] drink and oh anyway
[36:27] yeah get all cozy and warm and make you
[36:30] a
[36:32] nest fight it we all fight it we all do
[36:35] we all fight it but you know what that's
[36:38] the overcoming part he that overcometh
[36:40] will I give these things not he that
[36:42] sleepeth he that overcometh that
[36:45] thing all right so Christ Min God
[36:48] revealed we talking about for knowledge
[36:49] we got that out of the way so back part
[36:51] in the back part of God's mind he saw
[36:53] though there was something he was going
[36:55] to achieve now who's he going to achieve
[36:56] it through he's going to achieve it
[36:57] through people so he saw by for
[37:00] knowledge someone that would come
[37:02] together under this word of God and live
[37:06] it like God said it not like man said it
[37:09] not like this over here said but like
[37:10] God said it so he was going and trying
[37:13] to achieve now why would he why would he
[37:15] even make a plan if he didn't see the
[37:19] end result of it so you and I make a
[37:21] plan we want to build a house we want to
[37:23] do this and that and the other and and
[37:25] sometimes we change one thing thousand
[37:27] times but God can't put a plan together
[37:29] and it failed he can't put a plan
[37:31] together and it not
[37:33] work you know why cuz if for knew do you
[37:36] know if we knew
[37:39] today everything we were going to do
[37:41] tomorrow it'd be a lot
[37:44] easier do you remember you understand
[37:46] that it'd be a lot easier because we've
[37:48] got so many we don't know if the car's
[37:49] going to start
[37:50] tomorrow we don't know if we going to
[37:52] get fired from our job tomorrow we don't
[37:55] know if the government's going to take
[37:56] over Tom tomorrow according to Tony it
[37:58] is
[38:00] so Mark too sorry brother Mark but
[38:04] anyway government ain't got nothing to
[38:05] do with
[38:06] this there's one government that does
[38:09] and that's the government of God he does
[38:11] have a government because the Bible said
[38:12] the government was on his shoulders all
[38:14] right so who wherever the government
[38:16] government is it's on God's shoulders
[38:18] and I'm not worried about it but you
[38:20] don't you do but we do worry though we
[38:22] worry cuz tomorrow's news is going to be
[38:24] there's another killing or there's
[38:26] another this or another that there's
[38:27] always that that question mark but what
[38:29] if you knew everything was going to
[38:31] happen from today till the day of the
[38:32] Rapture it'd make things a lot easier or
[38:35] hard if you were on the bad side but it
[38:37] would make it easier and that's the way
[38:38] God is he's not nervous so what am I
[38:41] dependent on I'm not depending on me
[38:43] knowing what's tomorrow I'm depending on
[38:45] the guy that knows and holds tomorrow
[38:49] all right that's who I'm depending on
[38:51] and I want to get to know him better if
[38:52] you get to know him better then you get
[38:54] more intimate with that person and you
[38:56] get to know that person a little bit
[38:58] more so that's why I this whole thing is
[39:00] about
[39:01] intimacy that's right the marriage
[39:05] happened right
[39:07] here when you got born again you got
[39:12] married now Mom and Dad's been married
[39:15] 65
[39:19] years the they ever sto not knowing it
[39:22] yeah they know each other really well
[39:24] but tomorrow there'll be something else
[39:26] that come up right cuz we're
[39:29] humans but you get to know each other
[39:31] that's why I want us to get to know God
[39:33] cuz look if brother said God's got a
[39:35] secret
[39:36] mystery it's got to be revealed to us
[39:39] because the Bible tells us that in the
[39:41] days of the seventh angel all these
[39:43] Mysteries all this mystery not Mysteries
[39:46] mystery would be revealed and that's
[39:49] what we're going to get into when we get
[39:51] into the stat into the uh headstone is
[39:53] the revealing of all Mysteries we know
[39:56] now now even today we're picking a
[39:58] mystery at a time and we're looking at
[40:00] like the mystery of water baptism the
[40:02] mystery of predestination the mystery of
[40:05] all these different Mysteries now it's
[40:06] so common we've we've got it in the
[40:08] building you know uh we're building a
[40:10] new um uh couple of restrooms there at
[40:14] the uh at the city of
[40:16] Gillsville and you know we don't know
[40:18] how it's going to go cuz well we got the
[40:19] plans all done but you know you can I
[40:23] can see the
[40:25] foundation as they laid the
[40:28] blocks all right now hopefully 90 days
[40:32] from now I'm not going to worry about
[40:34] that Foundation cuz it's already built
[40:36] it's already done I'm not going to go
[40:38] out there and make sure they put the
[40:39] foundation no the building is built it's
[40:42] built on something so if we have our
[40:44] foundation there's no reason to go back
[40:47] as the Bible says don't go back and try
[40:49] to rebuild that Foundation that's what I
[40:52] was saying this morning listen if you
[40:54] get in trouble we don't get in trouble
[40:57] if you get in trouble don't say well I
[40:59] must be lost I want to get baptized
[41:00] again I want to receive the Holy Ghost I
[41:02] want to be
[41:03] Sanctified somewhere you going to have
[41:05] to say this is it you can only get wet
[41:08] so many times all right but if you'll
[41:11] settle down and say just look God
[41:12] forgive me of what I done and I'm going
[41:15] on problem is is we get bogged down and
[41:18] we go the other way we need to just give
[41:20] just give God the glory and say God I'm
[41:23] messed up and keep going that way right
[41:26] that's all of us keep going forward
[41:28] never go
[41:30] backwards there's nothing backwards in
[41:33] God yes so he was going to achieve it
[41:36] how was he going to achieve it through
[41:37] me and you and he was going to let
[41:38] himself be expressed how's he going to
[41:40] be expressed through
[41:43] us the First Corinthians says so that
[41:46] you be come behind and no
[41:49] gift waiting for the coming of our Lord
[41:51] Jesus look who shall also confirm you
[41:55] unto the end that you may be blameless
[41:58] in the day of Our Lord I want us to make
[41:59] sure we understand that I got all these
[42:01] quotes about that the whole Bible's full
[42:03] of them how he's going to make you
[42:05] spotless he's going to make you without
[42:07] wrinkle he's going to make you sons of
[42:10] God Philippians 2 you may be blameless
[42:12] now what is
[42:15] blameless you stole today you robbed a
[42:18] bank at
[42:22] 12:00 did
[42:24] he no cuz I saw you you were here so now
[42:29] you are blameless no one can bring now
[42:32] somebody can bring an
[42:34] accusation but there's so many a great
[42:36] cloud of witnesses that were here okay
[42:39] that saw Michael downstairs at 12:00 so
[42:43] that cloud of witness has made him
[42:46] blameless and harmless there's no way
[42:48] that they can judge him for robbing the
[42:51] bank he was here that's what God is
[42:54] doing for me and you amen he's taking
[42:56] our sins away making us blameless and
[43:00] harmless listen you and we have that we
[43:05] have that balance we say well brother B
[43:06] says said we sin every day now you're
[43:09] telling us that we're sinless and
[43:11] blameless the balance of the is is how
[43:14] to handle that in between we're going to
[43:18] sin okay we're going to have sins only
[43:21] Christians have sins okay we're going to
[43:23] sin but if we know how to handle it it
[43:26] never gets to God and it makes us
[43:28] blameless blameless everybody with me we
[43:31] know how the world doesn't know
[43:34] how listen the world doesn't even know
[43:37] how to say I'm
[43:38] sorry you know what it is it's somebody
[43:41] else's fault it's the government's
[43:45] fault so
[43:47] anyway no it's your fault my fault if we
[43:51] don't make it don't blame me don't blame
[43:54] brother Dale blame yourself
[43:57] self well don't get quiet on me
[44:02] now but I'm looking at a group of people
[44:05] that can be blameless and harmless sons
[44:08] of God look without
[44:11] rebuke if you do what God Said how's he
[44:14] going to rebuke you how you going to be
[44:17] rebuked in the midst of a crooked and
[44:20] perverse Nation well we know we
[44:23] that among whom you shine as
[44:26] lights in the world how we shine cuz we
[44:30] have
[44:31] a statue of a perfect
[44:34] man that that God is now living we see I
[44:38] was talking to somebody the other day
[44:40] the the Methodist Church is just in a
[44:42] turmoil for those of you that know that
[44:44] uh they're they're suing everybody
[44:46] they're all suing each
[44:48] other churches are suing
[44:51] churches yeah because one you know they
[44:54] said you can have a a gay woman preacher
[44:57] and the others like ain't having that so
[45:00] they're splitting because of that and
[45:02] they're just pointing fingers at each
[45:04] other now that's what a denomination has
[45:06] come down to in this end time is that
[45:08] they're fighting over something that
[45:10] should be really obvious and I like what
[45:12] our neighbor said Jay Ferguson I talked
[45:15] to him the other day he said I'm just
[45:17] going to build my own church that's
[45:18] where I'm
[45:20] going
[45:23] so but you see what see what we've come
[45:25] to
[45:26] you and I are coming we're here and we
[45:28] are solidified we've got a foundation we
[45:30] know where the the word of God is we
[45:32] know where God is we know what he's
[45:35] doing and where he's at and then the
[45:37] world don't have a clue well is he over
[45:39] here cuz there's a group of people
[45:40] that's going to let that woman standing
[45:42] in front of them they had a picture of
[45:43] one woman the other day at a Methodist
[45:45] Church had on a black robe with a white
[45:48] thing you know the little whatever you
[45:50] call it the Rope or whatever you say
[45:51] right here and
[45:54] it's rainbow colors all the way down he
[45:59] about that
[46:01] long
[46:03] no we have the right
[46:06] interpretation we have the right
[46:09] message and God's going to vindicate it
[46:11] through us not
[46:13] them but we've got to get into what
[46:15] we've got to get in a condition that God
[46:17] can use us
[46:20] amen but by having all these virtues
[46:23] working in our life that's how God can
[46:25] do it
[46:27] we have patience a man who's not swerve
[46:30] you you've seen people and so have I
[46:32] we'll just talk about this a little bit
[46:33] and then we'll if we don't go too far we
[46:35] won't we'll go eat some cake and ice
[46:37] cream but you see people that are and
[46:40] not just message people I'm talking
[46:41] about out in the world you see people
[46:42] that have no patience you look at them
[46:44] when they have no patience their world
[46:47] is just one big
[46:50] bomb they have no patience for this no
[46:52] patience for that no patience for the
[46:54] guy that cuts them off in the road and
[46:55] they give them that one finger wave
[46:58] there's no patience there's nothing to
[46:59] steer them in the right direction you
[47:02] and
[47:02] me if they cut you off in the middle in
[47:05] the middle of traffic so what right what
[47:09] are you worried
[47:10] about you said well that's just kind
[47:13] of no it's getting bad it's getting
[47:15] where people are shooting each other
[47:18] because you pull them you know you pull
[47:19] in front of them they going to shoot you
[47:20] road rage just killed a bunch of people
[47:23] several in Atlanta not too many weeks
[47:25] from now you know
[47:27] back but now you and I are not part of
[47:30] that there comes a time when we've got
[47:33] to separate ourself when when we get in
[47:35] a car a real car when we get in a car
[47:38] that we're not inundated with all the
[47:40] junk and the fil and all that stuff
[47:43] that's going on right and we don't have
[47:45] ill feelings toward people we don't have
[47:48] ill feelings toward the the the guy in
[47:50] front of you or the guy behind
[47:53] you well get quiet if you want to but
[47:55] I'm talking to every one of us
[47:58] now but we have a deliberate purpose
[48:02] that's why we can be patient we don't
[48:04] have to scream and holler at somebody
[48:06] when they cut us off or or when somebody
[48:08] does us wrong we're going to get in
[48:10] brotherly kindness and it's going to
[48:11] hurt us
[48:14] all but someone that but then you see
[48:16] somebody even a worldly person that's
[48:18] just as
[48:20] patient he's meticulous he don't jump
[48:23] into everything all the time and he's
[48:26] really successful because he doesn't
[48:27] dive in as brother rown says people that
[48:30] go out past God's plan and they become a
[48:33] wreck but then you do see people that
[48:35] become wrecked all the time just even in
[48:38] the natural world but what about the
[48:39] spiritual world what about us what about
[48:42] us today are we waiting on God are we
[48:45] not waiting on
[48:47] God I was thinking the other day I
[48:50] watched the cartoon way a long time ago
[48:52] and it was two um pheasants and there
[48:56] was two pheasants and and you know in
[48:58] the old in the old black and white
[49:00] days you you saw you heard the Hunters
[49:03] coming you heard the shooting you know
[49:05] well these two pheasants are are side by
[49:08] side hunkered down in a cornfield Corn's
[49:09] about that high hunker down in the
[49:11] cornfield and and one of them one of
[49:13] them looks at the other one and says
[49:16] don't move we got this don't move
[49:18] they'll walk by us don't move and the
[49:20] other one's like this I don't know if I
[49:21] can wait he's real close I don't know if
[49:23] I can wait well you see a boot come in
[49:25] picture
[49:26] so they're that close to him and the
[49:28] says just wait stay right here just wait
[49:29] stay you don't worry about him and the
[49:31] other one says I can't wait he's too
[49:33] close I got to go and then you see him
[49:34] you know you see him fly off out of the
[49:36] picture and you hear pom p and that
[49:39] other one you know down he like I told
[49:42] him that's the same way that's the same
[49:44] way with us listen to somebody be
[49:47] patient let God do his work be patient
[49:50] the devil's wanting to shoot every one
[49:52] of us but be patient be patient where
[49:55] your you're at at the moment but don't
[49:57] stay there but be patient be like that
[49:59] Fe be patient and tell others be patient
[50:03] and don't make a choice and go flying
[50:05] off cuz you get
[50:06] shot but that's the way it is in the
[50:08] world you know that it is you say hang
[50:10] on hold on no got to go gotta go get out
[50:13] of
[50:15] here unless we suffer we can't rain with
[50:18] him I love this quote it just keep
[50:20] coming up you have to suffer to
[50:23] rain the reason for this is a character
[50:26] is never made without suffering
[50:28] character is a victory not a gift does
[50:30] everybody understand that statement it's
[50:32] a victory when you have character it is
[50:35] a victory it is a battle that you have
[50:37] won and overcome not a gift that says
[50:41] here here's your patience my buddy just
[50:43] use it all any way you want to no no no
[50:46] no no you have to fight for that
[50:49] patience you have to fight for that
[50:51] virtue knowledge Temperance patience
[50:53] godliness brotherly kindness a man
[50:55] without without character can't rain
[50:57] because power apart from character is
[50:59] satanic but Power with character that's
[51:01] what God's looking for see we're coming
[51:03] into the stage of adoption I was
[51:05] listening to somebody uh the other day
[51:07] and they they just roll adoption into
[51:09] your new birth well now brother brandham
[51:12] says and I'll read you a quote where
[51:15] brother brandham says and I agree with I
[51:17] have to well I won't say that I get bad
[51:20] shape I don't need brother R to quote
[51:22] tell me that your new birth is different
[51:24] from your adoption I can read it in my
[51:26] Bible and I can see it in myself that
[51:28] the new birth is totally different from
[51:31] you got to have the new birth you got to
[51:33] have faith but it doesn't automatically
[51:36] make you adopted it doesn't
[51:37] automatically make you a manifested son
[51:40] and daughter of God you got to grow into
[51:43] that you got to have a what a tutor and
[51:45] a governor according to the book of
[51:47] Galatians you got to have a school
[51:48] Master somebody to what teach you bring
[51:50] you to Christ teach you how to stay
[51:53] hunker down in the corn field when the
[51:55] Hunter start
[51:57] coming but Power with characters fit to
[52:00] rule and since he wants us to share even
[52:03] his
[52:04] throne if he's required it folks he's
[52:06] got to make a way so here's the way all
[52:09] right here's the way it's the Bible
[52:12] prophet's message that's the way that's
[52:15] the way we make it we're not going to
[52:16] make it with James doton we're not going
[52:18] to make it now he's a nice guy good good
[52:20] fell
[52:23] but he's not somebody that I want to
[52:25] listen to all the
[52:27] time the little temporary sufferings we
[52:29] go through is not worthy to be compared
[52:31] with the tremendous Glory that will be
[52:33] revealed in us when he comes and oh what
[52:36] Treasures let's continue on let's skip
[52:38] through some of
[52:40] this the Lord is not slack concerning
[52:42] his promises he's longsuffering thank
[52:45] God he is longsuffering to us word not
[52:48] willing that any should perish but all
[52:50] would come to repentance now brother Ram
[52:53] also said look faith alone won't do it
[52:55] we read that a million times but listen
[52:57] I want you to understand something you
[52:59] can you go read and I'll try to find it
[53:01] where Paul says you can have all
[53:03] that and not have charity not have the
[53:05] new birth sounding brass and a tinkling
[53:08] symbol in other words you really have
[53:09] nothing to say right now he made ready
[53:13] and had faith in the promise this is
[53:14] Abraham father of our faith we can still
[53:17] have faith in the promise and not obey
[53:19] it it'll still hinder us let I was
[53:21] saying this morning you only really
[53:23] believe what you obey
[53:26] think about that you really only believe
[53:29] what you obey if you don't believe
[53:31] coming to church is important you won't
[53:33] so you're not going to obey it because
[53:34] you don't believe
[53:36] it all right and put other thing
[53:39] everything else in there then brother R
[53:41] talk about have patience with who
[53:43] patience with God if you got real
[53:45] genuine faith you'll have genuine
[53:47] patience because Faith worketh patience
[53:49] all right we'll continue on here a
[53:50] little bit skip through some of
[53:52] this but they that wait upon the Lord
[53:55] Lord shall renew their strength Mount up
[53:57] with wings as Eagles run and not be
[53:59] weary walk and not
[54:01] faint we should have patience with one
[54:03] another when we get to brotherly
[54:05] kindness I'm going to tie those two
[54:06] together to have patience because
[54:08] brother ra talks about having patience
[54:10] with your brother if he's off the word
[54:12] or different things I I don't I want us
[54:15] to understand that that that being off
[54:17] the word is not not
[54:20] horrible if you hear the right word and
[54:24] then come to it we've all done that
[54:27] everyone brother Dale preached one time
[54:29] I mean he was preaching away and
[54:30] something came to me I'm like man I
[54:32] ain't never seen like that
[54:34] before well I was ignorant back over
[54:38] here but when I come to the light or the
[54:41] knowledge of the truth there was
[54:43] something inside of me that took me to
[54:46] that not away from it all right it it
[54:49] brings me to that and that's what the
[54:51] school Master does even on up front he
[54:53] brings you to Christ tell knows you
[54:55] where he's at what he's doing and what
[54:57] he saying to you not your neighbor not
[54:58] your wife you what he saying to
[55:02] you we should have patience with one
[55:05] another he said it's hard to do I've
[55:07] tried to have patience 33 years women
[55:10] still Bob their hair still just the same
[55:13] but just have patience brother Brown
[55:15] did have to if you ain't got it don't
[55:18] try to build it that Hebrews tells about
[55:21] laying every weight aside run with
[55:24] patience the race that's set before us
[55:26] enduring the cross he endured the cross
[55:30] he that endureth to the end shall be
[55:37] saved what's the scripture he that
[55:39] starts a good work in me in other words
[55:40] he's going to finish it all right if you
[55:43] let him start that good word inside of
[55:45] you or that work all right endureth
[55:47] means to remain abide not recede or flee
[55:50] in other words uh first little problem
[55:52] that we have we
[55:54] disappear first little problem we have
[55:56] and you quit going to church and then
[55:58] you start making
[56:00] excuses well stay here stay under the
[56:04] fountain stay here long enough until God
[56:07] works on you not us till God works on
[56:10] you all
[56:11] right and we got those who endure to the
[56:14] end shall be saved all right let's go to
[56:18] Godliness just for a minute I got to
[56:20] there's a few more I want you to I want
[56:21] to read
[56:22] here it's reverence and respect this is
[56:25] where we kind of got this morning piety
[56:26] towards God our godliness and then he
[56:29] requires that we have this but he also
[56:33] shows us a form of godliness and that's
[56:35] what we're going to talk about this
[56:37] afternoon and we'll get to it here in
[56:38] just a minute let's continue through
[56:41] here fifthly add godliness oh my
[56:43] godliness to be added what does
[56:45] godliness mean he talks about to be like
[56:47] God after you got faith and all those
[56:49] things then be like God oh yes you can
[56:52] they said no can't do that brother Brown
[56:54] yes yes you
[56:59] can all the virtue all the things that's
[57:02] in God is in
[57:04] you well I don't know if I believe that
[57:07] well guess what then you're not going to
[57:08] obey
[57:10] it if you don't believe it you're not
[57:12] going to obey
[57:13] it I'm going to keep that that's my new
[57:16] favorite phrase be therefore perfect
[57:19] even as your father in Heaven is perfect
[57:21] if he said it he had to make a way for
[57:23] us to do it now he even said that 2,000
[57:25] years ago listen to me with a group of
[57:28] people that wasn't even born again yet
[57:31] amen right they were just Justified and
[57:33] Sanctified they had not been born again
[57:35] they had not went to the upper
[57:38] room you get way up here now before
[57:41] you're asked to do this though all these
[57:43] things has to be added first then when
[57:47] you get up here he's asked you now to be
[57:49] perfect godliness Sons and Daughters of
[57:52] God that's right how many things can I
[57:53] say on that line he continues on I'm
[57:56] going to just keep skipping through this
[57:57] so we'll not be so long today some of
[57:59] you already checked out
[58:01] so we'll see if we can hurry up a a man
[58:05] that's born again a Son of God has to
[58:07] have the nature of God he has to be like
[58:09] God he honors God he's part of the word
[58:11] of God in other words he does what the
[58:13] word
[58:14] says that's just pretty simple he does
[58:16] what the word says and listen we don't
[58:19] all do what the word says all the time
[58:21] okay sorry about that
[58:27] right he's part of the word of God and
[58:29] then this last day of this bride taking
[58:31] form exactly the same power that he was
[58:34] at the beginning has come up through
[58:36] these organizations see he didn't do
[58:37] away with organizations God moved
[58:40] through those
[58:41] organizations and then what come out for
[58:43] the bride which is us he can't do
[58:46] nothing but that see those denominations
[58:48] had to come God had to move through the
[58:49] Baptist to see that we do believe in
[58:51] eternal security if it's taught the
[58:53] right way right
[58:55] we do believe in predestination if it's
[58:57] talked the right way not like Calvinism
[58:59] or Armenian ISM it bring it back
[59:01] together and that's the way it is all
[59:03] right we don't believe in in uh Trinity
[59:07] because we know a different but they Tau
[59:09] a trinity all the way through even even
[59:11] U three of the church agent Messengers
[59:13] were
[59:14] trinitarians Columba Luther and Wesley
[59:17] they were trinitarians but God winked at
[59:19] their ignorance and we look back and
[59:21] quote Wesley and we look back and quote
[59:23] Luther all right but that's okay to
[59:25] quote them and then move
[59:27] forward move forward into God and not
[59:30] move backwards I think you know what I
[59:32] do we'll just all be lutherans now from
[59:34] now on everybody be lutherans okay and
[59:37] you can talk to each other at the beer
[59:38] store
[59:42] then some of y'all get
[59:45] that but you that's what I mean the
[59:47] lutherans you what their founder smoked
[59:51] a pipe and drank
[59:52] beer right but was a church a messenger
[59:56] I we know better see when I said that
[59:58] you're like no we don't do that right
[1:00:01] well we don't do that no we don't do
[1:00:06] that why because God's moved
[1:00:08] up listen folks I'm telling you you and
[1:00:11] I are astronauts we are able to take
[1:00:14] this pressure if you're not able to take
[1:00:17] this pressure you're not want to hits
[1:00:19] cuz you have been put in this age to
[1:00:21] take the
[1:00:22] pressure listen the has been put in this
[1:00:25] age not to fail so he gave us amen he
[1:00:30] gave us the pressurized suit he gave us
[1:00:33] the intelligence of God not the
[1:00:35] intelligence of man that we can get into
[1:00:37] a spaceship and we can go out as far as
[1:00:40] a million miles or whatever more we can
[1:00:42] see you think the mind of God's Just A
[1:00:44] Million Miles Away the mind of God's
[1:00:47] Eternal and brother B said let's go back
[1:00:49] into his mind we just went right back
[1:00:52] into millions and billions of miles
[1:00:55] right just like
[1:01:01] that first Timothy said for Kings he's
[1:01:04] talking about prayers and intercessions
[1:01:06] giving
[1:01:08] thanks that we may lead a quiet and
[1:01:10] Peaceable life in all godliness and
[1:01:13] honesty now that one we have to work on
[1:01:15] all right all of us all sometimes
[1:01:18] especially when you got kids and U you
[1:01:22] got kids running around and and and uh
[1:01:25] it don't seem like it's quiet and and uh
[1:01:28] orderly but that's not what God's
[1:01:29] talking about he's talking about you not
[1:01:32] getting upset and throwing things at
[1:01:33] them when that does
[1:01:37] happen somebody says well I'm can't be
[1:01:40] throwing stuff
[1:01:43] now let's read this right here I told
[1:01:46] you in Timothy he says a lot about Paul
[1:01:48] says a lot about being Godly I will
[1:01:50] there I will therefore that men pray
[1:01:52] everywhere lifting up holy hands some of
[1:01:54] yall ought tried that without wrath and
[1:01:57] doubting in like manner also that women
[1:02:00] Adorn themselves in modest apparel with
[1:02:01] shamefacedness and sobriety not with
[1:02:04] broidered hair or gold or pearls or
[1:02:06] costly array but now watch in
[1:02:10] parentheses take that parentheses away
[1:02:13] and and Paul is just saying but with
[1:02:15] good
[1:02:16] works right but he's interpolating or
[1:02:20] he's making a he's bringing his thought
[1:02:23] process out that says which becometh
[1:02:26] women professing godliness do you know
[1:02:30] if you walk down the street and you look
[1:02:31] Godly and you look you look like the you
[1:02:34] know the the well if you look like the
[1:02:36] fashion of the world and all that you
[1:02:38] know there's no godliness there I mean
[1:02:41] man you see some of these people going
[1:02:42] to church and I was looking uh one a
[1:02:45] friend of ours had a a daughter went to
[1:02:47] a went to a junior senior or whatever is
[1:02:49] it junior senior time I guess it is prom
[1:02:53] prom night
[1:02:55] Lord they want enough material in that
[1:02:57] girl's dress to for nothing and the guy
[1:03:00] she was with had his hand right where he
[1:03:02] shouldn't have his hand they're just
[1:03:03] going to a party that's what the world's
[1:03:06] producing
[1:03:08] now sisters little kids don't let
[1:03:11] somebody touch you like that and don't
[1:03:13] put on something that'll provoke
[1:03:16] that we want to become women professing
[1:03:22] godliness with good words you see Paul's
[1:03:25] Paul Paul comes out and he he's he's
[1:03:27] really telling the um women to Adorn
[1:03:30] them themselves in modest apparel and he
[1:03:32] keeps talking he keeps telling the women
[1:03:34] you know you don't supposed to PE in
[1:03:35] church and you're supposed to be uh you
[1:03:37] know silent and all those things but
[1:03:39] look what he says in verse 10 he says
[1:03:41] but which becometh women professing
[1:03:43] godliness with good works so he's
[1:03:45] putting them on a pedestal as brother
[1:03:48] Bram you know the the the brother asked
[1:03:50] me one time he said he's not in the
[1:03:51] message anymore but he said why did
[1:03:53] Brother Brown call women dog meat I I
[1:03:55] said he didn't call you women dog
[1:03:58] meat I said he called that kind of woman
[1:04:02] dog
[1:04:03] meat listen without the new birth we're
[1:04:06] dog
[1:04:07] meat we're Canon father if we if we
[1:04:09] don't have the new birth but it's just
[1:04:11] something you pick with everybody wants
[1:04:13] to pick pick on this and pick on that
[1:04:16] listen brother Bram always gave honor to
[1:04:19] a good godly woman always gave honor to
[1:04:21] a good godly woman always did never did
[1:04:24] he be little a Godly woman but when
[1:04:27] they're turned into all those other
[1:04:29] things like brother R said he's right
[1:04:31] they can send more people to Hell than
[1:04:33] never be join in this in the country
[1:04:35] walking down the street with no clothes
[1:04:37] on like they did at the prom I'd hate to
[1:04:39] go to them proms now I'm telling you
[1:04:41] even when we went to proms 50 years ago
[1:04:44] June had a dress on that was up to here
[1:04:46] had long
[1:04:47] sleeves not
[1:04:50] anymore but that's what the world's come
[1:04:52] to because they don't have God
[1:04:55] they're Godless they don't have
[1:04:57] godliness they're
[1:05:01] Godless let the women learn in Silence
[1:05:03] with all
[1:05:05] subjection now if you look at that now
[1:05:08] that when when Paul's talking about
[1:05:09] godliness right there that godliness
[1:05:12] interpretation in the Greek is reverence
[1:05:15] toward God's goodness not yours toward
[1:05:18] God's
[1:05:20] goodness it's worshipper of God are
[1:05:24] worshiping God you know why he's the
[1:05:27] sisters you know what you're doing right
[1:05:29] there you're worshiping
[1:05:32] God when you're professing
[1:05:35] godliness you don't have to be in a
[1:05:37] church you don't have to be in a church
[1:05:39] sitting you can be walking down Walmart
[1:05:41] and condemn the whole
[1:05:43] place cuz you're walking Godly and then
[1:05:47] that's going to tell the world that
[1:05:49] you're worshiping
[1:05:52] God cuz remember you only believe what
[1:05:55] you
[1:05:56] obey think about that you keep thinking
[1:05:58] about you only the only thing you care
[1:06:02] about is what you believe
[1:06:06] in
[1:06:10] right if thou put the brethren in
[1:06:12] remembrance of these things Thou shalt
[1:06:14] be a good minister of Jesus Christ
[1:06:16] nourished up into the words of faith and
[1:06:18] good Doctrine where unto thou Hast
[1:06:19] attained but refuse profane an old wives
[1:06:22] fables and exercise thyself rather unto
[1:06:26] godliness for bodily exercise profiteth
[1:06:30] little but godliness is profitable unto
[1:06:34] all things having promise of the life
[1:06:37] that now is now watch having promise of
[1:06:40] the life that now is if you live
[1:06:42] Godly all right you're going to be okay
[1:06:44] on this side and on the other side right
[1:06:48] look at that having promis of the life
[1:06:49] that is now and the life which is to
[1:06:52] come this is a faithful saying and
[1:06:55] worthy of all acceptation in other words
[1:06:58] you need to accept what we just told you
[1:07:00] 1 Timothy 6:3 said If any man Teach
[1:07:03] otherwise and consent not to Wholesome
[1:07:06] words even the words of our Lord Jesus
[1:07:08] and to the doctrine which is according
[1:07:11] to Godliness he is proud knowing nothing
[1:07:14] wow but doting about questions and
[1:07:17] strife of words whereof cometh Envy
[1:07:20] Strife railing evil surmising perverse
[1:07:24] disputings of men of corrupt minds and
[1:07:26] destitute of the truth pretty bad
[1:07:29] characters supposing that gain is
[1:07:33] godliness H I'm successful so I must be
[1:07:39] Godly I'm successful so I must be Godly
[1:07:42] no that don't mean one
[1:07:44] thing from such withdraw thyself get
[1:07:49] away from that but godliness with
[1:07:52] contentment is great gain for we brought
[1:07:55] nothing into this world and it's certain
[1:07:57] that we're g GNA carry nothing else out
[1:07:59] with us never seen a caset full of
[1:08:03] money
[1:08:05] nope but that word contentment look what
[1:08:08] it means sufficiency watch this a
[1:08:12] perfect condition of life in which no
[1:08:16] Aid or support is
[1:08:18] needed that's
[1:08:20] contentment sufficiency of the
[1:08:22] necessities of life
[1:08:24] a mind contented with its
[1:08:30] lot I told them at work the other day
[1:08:33] and and just a little story about a
[1:08:37] government um they redid our routes and
[1:08:40] they re-evaluated our our routes when
[1:08:42] you work for the Post Office you get um
[1:08:46] evaluation time for for every box you do
[1:08:49] every package you deliver all the scans
[1:08:52] you do it's just a bunch of stuff added
[1:08:54] together and that's your
[1:08:55] salary well like mine was was uh mine
[1:08:59] was estimated at 5 and 1/2 hours a day
[1:09:03] and U which is part-time but I do get
[1:09:07] benefits but and I like it that way
[1:09:09] because I'm usually finished by about
[1:09:10] 12:00 but I usually get it done in 3 and
[1:09:13] a half to 4 hours so there's an hour and
[1:09:15] a half there that I get paid that I I
[1:09:17] can be sitting home taking a nap well
[1:09:19] anyway so and I and I'm okay with that
[1:09:22] that should be
[1:09:25] but the other day they came in and they
[1:09:27] upset the apple card they took and
[1:09:29] re-evaluated all that instead of giving
[1:09:31] us two minutes for a box they give us a
[1:09:33] minute and a half so it cut my salary
[1:09:35] $100 a week down to about 4 hours
[1:09:39] evaluated time and that's about what I
[1:09:41] got but they were and and it is one of
[1:09:45] the girls there she makes about 80 grand
[1:09:46] a year and she's only going to make 72
[1:09:48] she's going to lose about $88,000 a year
[1:09:50] but I told him you know the Bible tells
[1:09:52] us you know what John told us
[1:09:58] what John tell us John the Baptist told
[1:10:01] those two soldiers he said be content
[1:10:06] with your
[1:10:08] wages and I explained to him the other
[1:10:11] day I said look I said how can you live
[1:10:13] in a town of 300 people in Gillsville
[1:10:17] drive 10 miles to work have no
[1:10:22] traffic and still make $72,000 a year I
[1:10:25] said don't
[1:10:28] complain be content with what you
[1:10:32] got I can't stand people that argue
[1:10:35] about what the government or or what
[1:10:39] your job does to
[1:10:42] you if you live Godly and you have you
[1:10:45] know how to handle that cuz you know
[1:10:47] what it'll eat your soul it's going to
[1:10:50] eat some of them up there's thousands of
[1:10:52] people in across across the country
[1:10:53] that's getting ready to either quit
[1:10:55] they're going to strike I think they
[1:10:56] walked on Washington today they they you
[1:10:59] know got their picket lines and all that
[1:11:00] stuff and that's okay because we don't
[1:11:03] want listen we don't want people to walk
[1:11:04] over us right there's a big difference
[1:11:07] we don't want people to walk over us but
[1:11:09] we want to be content and say hey for
[1:11:11] what I make and for what I do I'm
[1:11:14] fine I'm good I'm okay godliness with
[1:11:19] contentment is what gain gain that's
[1:11:24] right I'd rather
[1:11:25] gain that not that out there but that
[1:11:28] what he's talking about than to gain the
[1:11:29] whole world and lose my soul that know
[1:11:31] what the scripture
[1:11:33] says now that's not saying you don't
[1:11:35] make yourself better try to do better
[1:11:37] try to make more money but if something
[1:11:40] like that happens you it'll eat you to
[1:11:42] death and it'll make you just make you
[1:11:44] have a horrible
[1:11:45] Life Second Timothy 3:1 I'm not going to
[1:11:48] charge you for that one that was a Dave
[1:11:50] Ramsey John's
[1:11:52] like you going to use that next time
[1:11:56] okay everybody enjoy brother John
[1:11:59] talking to us about yeah I mean really
[1:12:01] good he said well it ain't got nothing
[1:12:03] to do with the word it absolutely does
[1:12:05] every bit of it
[1:12:08] does you know why we don't like it cuz
[1:12:11] we don't do
[1:12:13] it praise the Lord Ain that right second
[1:12:17] Timothy 3 verse
[1:12:19] one I am I I this is what you get I
[1:12:23] brother R Spencer was preaching away the
[1:12:24] other day and he was talking about
[1:12:26] something and he said hey don't get your
[1:12:29] panties in a wad and he stopped for
[1:12:32] about two seconds he said hey that's the
[1:12:34] way we roll around here get over
[1:12:38] it this know this that in the last days
[1:12:41] perilous time shall come for men shall
[1:12:43] be what lovers of their own self boy
[1:12:46] ain't that today selfies Covetous
[1:12:49] boasters proud blasphemers disobedient
[1:12:51] to parents unth thankful Unholy well
[1:12:53] without natural affection we see that
[1:12:55] also truce Breakers false accusers
[1:12:57] incontinent Fierce despisers of those
[1:13:00] that are good you know junor and I were
[1:13:01] doing something the other day and we
[1:13:02] filled out a a form and it said what was
[1:13:04] your gender at
[1:13:08] Birth not what's your gender now it's
[1:13:12] what was your gender at Birth you had to
[1:13:14] put male or female one of the two I I
[1:13:16] just can't believe well I can too
[1:13:18] despisers of those that are good tra
[1:13:20] traitors he high- minded lovers of
[1:13:22] pleasures more than the lovers of God
[1:13:24] having a form of godliness now this is
[1:13:26] what we're going to get into and then
[1:13:27] we'll stop right here but denying the
[1:13:29] power having a form of
[1:13:31] godliness just doing just enough to get
[1:13:34] by from such turn away now anointed ones
[1:13:37] at the end time listen to this otherwise
[1:13:40] if he wanted to break it down so we
[1:13:41] would more or less understand it better
[1:13:44] he would say in the last days there
[1:13:45] shall come false anointed ones now that
[1:13:48] seems almost impossible see the term of
[1:13:51] anointed but notice the very next words
[1:13:54] false prophets p r o p h e TS plural now
[1:13:58] anointed one is one with a message all
[1:14:02] right stick with me here for just a
[1:14:04] second we'll go eat some cake y'all be
[1:14:07] awake for that I promise you you won't
[1:14:08] face won't and the only way the message
[1:14:12] can be brought out is by one that's
[1:14:15] anointed and that would be a prophet
[1:14:19] anointed there shall rise false anointed
[1:14:22] teachers
[1:14:24] a prophet teaches what his message
[1:14:28] is Anointed teachers look but anointed
[1:14:32] people with false
[1:14:35] teaching anointed ones Christ plural
[1:14:38] prophets plural and if there is such a
[1:14:41] thing as Christ singular then these
[1:14:44] would have to be anointed ones that
[1:14:47] their prophecy of what they were
[1:14:49] teaching would be the difference because
[1:14:51] they are anointed ones anointed you may
[1:14:53] say how can this
[1:14:55] be what were they Christ CH r s TS false
[1:14:59] prophets anointed ones Jesus said the
[1:15:02] rain falls on the just and the unjust
[1:15:04] now watch this now someone might say to
[1:15:06] me do you believe that that anointing on
[1:15:08] those people means that it's the
[1:15:11] anointing of the Holy
[1:15:13] Spirit yes
[1:15:14] sir the genuine holy spirit of God upon
[1:15:18] a person and yet they are
[1:15:21] false there's you form of godliness but
[1:15:25] denying the power thereof now listen
[1:15:26] close and see what he said and they
[1:15:28] shall show signs and wonders in so much
[1:15:30] it would deceive the very elect if it
[1:15:32] were possible and they are anointed with
[1:15:34] the genuine Holy Spirit only the son of
[1:15:39] man in the end time is going to
[1:15:41] distinguish those two Spirits cuz when
[1:15:44] Jesus was standing in the upper room
[1:15:46] there was 12 people there right one of
[1:15:49] them was the devil or anointed by the
[1:15:51] devil his name was Judas not one person
[1:15:54] knew except the son of man he knew who
[1:15:57] that was because he could discern the
[1:15:59] spirit that was in that person because
[1:16:01] listen he somebody said somebody said
[1:16:03] Lord who is it he said it's the one that
[1:16:04] spped the ball with me right the Bible
[1:16:07] says Judas reached over and soed the
[1:16:10] bowl and they still didn't see
[1:16:12] it so they were
[1:16:15] deceived we're going to be deceived if
[1:16:17] we don't have that kind of godliness
[1:16:19] right because we're heading toward the
[1:16:21] headstone we're heading toward that it's
[1:16:23] going to be a brother Brown said a
[1:16:25] Razor's
[1:16:27] Edge and they are anointed with a
[1:16:29] genuine Holy Spirit I know this sounds
[1:16:31] very foolish but we're going to take
[1:16:33] time and explain it by the word that
[1:16:35] that's absolutely thus sayith the Lord
[1:16:39] the truth let's continue reading this is
[1:16:41] Anointed ones at the end time but
[1:16:42] remember that Pentecostal Church in the
[1:16:44] last days was a lay out of sea and
[1:16:46] Christ was turned out the kernel the
[1:16:48] wheed itself when he tried remember when
[1:16:51] he tried to manifest himself in the the
[1:16:53] church he was thrown out or taken out it
[1:16:58] was still a church claimed to be
[1:17:01] anointed cus stayed anointed even though
[1:17:05] he put Jesus on the cross right but
[1:17:07] watch but here is the word Christ
[1:17:10] himself that's the anointed word which
[1:17:13] shall come for the rest of his body the
[1:17:17] bride the anointed of the same water
[1:17:20] that watered the wheat as we talked
[1:17:22] about also Waters the tears anointed
[1:17:26] ones only the elected are predestinated
[1:17:29] now that's predestinated God knowing who
[1:17:31] would do who would take it and who
[1:17:33] wouldn't will be able to detect the
[1:17:40] difference will be able to detect the
[1:17:43] difference between them now Ephesians
[1:17:46] 5:1 tells you so and about and about how
[1:17:50] it was they are anointed ones everybody
[1:17:52] says glor glory to God we got freedom
[1:17:54] down here hallelujah oh Hallelujah we
[1:17:56] speak in tongues and jump we got freedom
[1:17:59] of the women you try to put them under
[1:18:02] all these kinds of things see go ahead
[1:18:04] there ain't nothing you can do say well
[1:18:06] we speak in tongues we shout we dance in
[1:18:07] the spirit we preach the word absolutely
[1:18:11] not one thing to say against it so do
[1:18:14] these people back here in the Bible
[1:18:15] Jesus said it'll deceive the very
[1:18:17] elected if it were possible the very
[1:18:19] elected now he's talking about having a
[1:18:21] form of godliness listen
[1:18:23] it only lets the wheat be known to the
[1:18:26] elected which are part of it notice how
[1:18:29] beautiful this is brought here only the
[1:18:31] notice the anointed ones be able the
[1:18:34] true elected predestinated Ephesians 5
[1:18:36] or 1: 15 rather will be ordained elected
[1:18:39] they're the only ones that it will not
[1:18:42] deceive notice the anointed prophets
[1:18:44] will be false and there among it will be
[1:18:47] true anointed how you going to tell it
[1:18:50] by the
[1:18:51] word
[1:18:55] how you going to tell it by the word
[1:18:57] like we have it in Shadow do you see it
[1:19:00] congregation says amen notice the
[1:19:02] anointed ones only the word will
[1:19:04] separate them not the
[1:19:07] signs oh when we get up here to this
[1:19:09] godliness brother way we just going to
[1:19:11] shout speaking you can I wish you
[1:19:13] would but that doesn't mean that you're
[1:19:15] at that
[1:19:16] godliness it means you can have a form
[1:19:18] of that
[1:19:19] godliness they'll do the same signs but
[1:19:22] the words what separated them sure they
[1:19:26] all prophesied they all done this that
[1:19:28] and the other sure just the same Jesus
[1:19:30] said they do the same but the word is
[1:19:32] what separated them notice not
[1:19:35] signs brother ramam said in North it's
[1:19:39] not I want you to see he he clarified
[1:19:43] he's talking about preaching this last
[1:19:46] Sunday right here this was the Sunday
[1:19:48] after that at the Tabernacle he said see
[1:19:51] they are anointed they're Spirits are
[1:19:53] anointed in the second
[1:19:56] realm anybody with
[1:19:59] me in the second realm which is what
[1:20:01] memory reason conscious affection
[1:20:03] imagination first realm is either Faith
[1:20:05] or doubt it's not both all right you're
[1:20:08] either born again today or you're not if
[1:20:10] you're born again you're sealed in to
[1:20:11] the day of your Redemption amen if
[1:20:14] you're not born again today you can be
[1:20:16] among that group of anointed ones to
[1:20:18] where your souls as black as such and
[1:20:20] your spirit gets anointed by the truth
[1:20:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost and you speak
[1:20:24] in tongues preach the gospel see signs
[1:20:26] and wonders do signs and wonders but it
[1:20:29] doesn't get all the way down that's why
[1:20:30] the new birth that Bible was talking
[1:20:31] about this morning the new birth is the
[1:20:33] most important thing that you'll ever
[1:20:35] get is to know that God's in your soul
[1:20:37] not anointing your spirit and not making
[1:20:39] you feel good not making
[1:20:41] you jump and
[1:20:43] Shout today brother R talks right here
[1:20:46] we finish right here Christ revealed in
[1:20:48] his own word today so confused about the
[1:20:51] evidence of the Holy Ghost amen and so
[1:20:53] forth Satan can impersonate any kind of
[1:20:56] a gift that God has got but he cannot
[1:20:58] bring that word word by word that's
[1:21:01] where he failed in the Garden of Eden
[1:21:03] that's where he's always failed it's
[1:21:06] where them to tape on false anointed
[1:21:07] ones or anointed ones they can be
[1:21:09] Anointed with the spirit speak in
[1:21:11] tongues dance shout preach the gospel
[1:21:13] and still be a
[1:21:16] devil still be a
[1:21:20] devil so what's the most important thing
[1:21:22] speaking in tongue shouting no know that
[1:21:25] you got the new
[1:21:26] birth know that you got the new birth
[1:21:28] that you're sealed out God sealed in
[1:21:32] Satan sealed out God sealed in and
[1:21:34] sealed to the day of your Redemption
[1:21:37] then now we are working on that next
[1:21:39] realm that Spirit realm we're trying to
[1:21:41] drive those evil spirits out is
[1:21:43] everybody with me that's what this
[1:21:44] statue of perfect man is it's driving
[1:21:46] out the other
[1:21:49] demons you think Satan wants you to
[1:21:52] prosper
[1:21:54] he wants you to fail so he's going to
[1:21:56] he's going to fight for your soul when
[1:21:58] he loses that guess what he's going to
[1:21:59] fight for he ain't leaving
[1:22:01] town he ain't leaving town folks he just
[1:22:04] goes out in your spirit realm and starts
[1:22:06] in your memory Reon conscious effects
[1:22:07] and Imagination and starts working there
[1:22:10] and make you miserable right if you'll
[1:22:13] let
[1:22:14] him all right let's talk a me about
[1:22:16] brotherly kindness and then we'll stop
[1:22:17] right
[1:22:19] here besides this giving all diligence
[1:22:21] add to your faith ver diverse knowledge
[1:22:23] everybody understand there's two forms
[1:22:24] of
[1:22:25] godliness being Godly and having a form
[1:22:29] of godliness but deny the power of that
