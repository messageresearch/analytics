TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we coming up to the uh time to get together about getting the food for the camp so we're going to set a menu uh the camp is in July the last weekend in July and uh if we start now we don't have to do as much this year as we did last year because the camp has been shortened by one day so there'll be four meals that we don't have to fix but uh you've been generous in the past and U and I I think that generosity can just carry on to the next year we will have a list of what we need uh if you want to give us money and we'll go buy the stuff that's fine and we are also this year brother Joe got us a lot of cakes and stuff last year uh free and I don't think we're going to be able to do that so we're going to have to get all of you just Bak some cookies and cakes and and cupcakes and all that good fattening stuff and U do it like we did a couple years ago but just wanted you to keep that in your heart and in your mind be praying about it uh June and I are definitely going to be there and I know some of you are going to go with us um some of you that been in the past you don't ever want to come back but uh Susan said it was work and they laid out a day or two so I don't know where they went okay they were late a few days that's what it was they were late and when you're late for a meal you're you're just late you miss a meal you're just you're just late but but thank you for your generosity in the past 3 years you know it's really it wouldn't have happened without this church paying for the food for those of you that are new that don't know anything about it every year brother berley Williams has a camp for the children and it started with 40 or 50 and then it's got up to now 125 to 150 kids and June and myself have took the burden on cooking for every meal for which is four meals a day and usually it started on Thursday Friday Saturday and Sunday now they're only going to start it on Friday Saturday and Sunday because of a camp schedule a guy scheduled the camp to run till Thursday and it knocked us out a day which was not because of participation it was because the guy didn't know what to schedule so it's just going to be Friday Saturday and Sunday morning but uh in the past we had as a church not out of the church funds but out of your pocket in our pocket in our time we have give money or give food or make cookies or cakes to to uh help brother Burley because without that um to be honest with he couldn't have a camp because it would cost3 or $4,000 extra if you put ta the food bill on to what he charges the people and we do that for free as a church so and uh the people really enjoy it and they know that that it comes from the people not from the spoken word church we could have funded the whole thing but it comes from the people it comes from you brothers and sisters you know it's like you always say we got plenty of money it's just in your pocket so you can get it out like I said about brother dicks his is folded up for so long when you open it up it just fold right back again they everybody's been generous I'm just asking you it's now like 17 weeks away so I know everything's tight and money's tight but it just every little bit will help you know put up $5 a week put it in an envelope and you know 10 weeks from now guess what she got 50 bucks and then you can hand that over to us and we will absolutely take every dime of it and put it toward uh good food for the camp and the ones that's been there it's been an experience Janet and Boyd got to go with us and and uh um sister Rebecca got to go and brother Joe and sister Glenn's always been there with us so we have a lot of fun it's tiring it's never boring but just keep that in your heart it'll be the last weekend in July is when we'll have the camp and we will get all the uh all the um I think June and sister gw's worked on the on the menu to get it together and uh and brother Donnie and sister Susan got to go with us last year so they it was a treat for them so if anybody wants to just jump on in you can go with us Bob it's work it is it's work is it I mean it's work but you know what we do it for the kids and they know that they know that's our ministry to them and they're very appreciative because what they tell us they told us they said this ain't camp food we don't cook them camp food we cook them good food that's right but it's all because of what you give and we appreciate it that you do that again this year okay Lord bless you he's 32 in them back when I back when I was young they used to tell it around I never did hear it much cuz I can't remember back that far but they always said I was going to be a lawyer cuz I always said why why why and all that you know and if things just run over in my mind and I can't remember them as

find him amen good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if youd like turning you scriptures turn to back where we where this morning and we'll be at Genesis 1:26 and 27 now remember that we're still the background of all of it is still Ephesians 1 that we're still you know in that do and and we'll pick back up a couple of more things out of it as we go along but we're just wanting to uh get to a place you know to have a better understanding so it'll be if Genesis 1:26 and 27 and Psalms 885 Psalms 85 right you know I wonder what the world thinks when they see us on the internet and wonder what's going on but you know we do enjoy ourselves so that's that's all right we have a good time in the Lord and maybe they can enjoy it too I don't see why the Christians can't be happy you know I am I'm I'm very happy about the Lord and his doings and it makes me very happy in all things amen so Genesis 126 and 27 and Psalms 85 now remember the Lord willingness coming Sunday that brother Claude weinger will be with us preaching for uh the Sunday Services there with us remember that and also remember now the Easter weekend brother Jim Pinkston from uh witch Kansas will be with us preaching and that will be now on the 23rd I think 24th which will be the Easter weekend and we'll have Saturday night service now 7:00 and then Sunday morning service and we will be having a dinner together you know and on the afternoon and fellowship together on that one all right also now we have the fellowship meeting will be here in the month of May I think it's the 21st and we will then be having Saturday night Sunday Services um you know and that will be all both Sunday services on that one cuz that'll be the doing and brother juel forny will be here uh preaching for us on the fellowship meeting weekend so just remember these announcements if you miss anything go on to the internet and brother Joe is so gracious he puts everything up and keeps up with what we're doing he has to keep me straight A lot of times cuz I get the wrong numbers on my messages and I preach so many on one thing until some times I just keep repeating the number you know but that's all right we we we try to stay together okay Genesis 1 126 and 27 in Psalms 85 Heavenly Father our Lord Our Savior Our Redeemer our All In All In Jesus is your name thank you for all things Lord you said you give them to us freely so then Lord help us to be able to receive them and we just ask you now that you'd come on the scene this afternoon and speak to our hearts and our our lives and help us to rejoice in you and Lord to see you the author and finisher of our faith Lord Just Have Your Way bless those that are sick the ones that are not with us the to sin sick Lord you promised it and we believe you CU you said in your word that you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so if something is destroying us then we can depend on your word we can depend on you Lord just have your way now and guide us and forgive our sins because we want to stand complete in you and lead us in thine understanding in Jesus name amen Genesis 1:26 and 27 well see if we can tie these two scriptures together this afternoon because we'll go from there to Psalms 85 all right and God said let us make man in our image after our light and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the A and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over ever creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them right now go to Psalms 85 and notice the reading of what the psalmist is is saying Psalms 85 Lord thou has been favorable unto thy land thou has brought back the Captivity of Jacob now watch these are Naturals and then it'll come over thou has forgiven the iniquity of thy people thou has covered all their sin the blood atonement can take care of things thou has taken away all thy Wrath thou H has turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger that was a promise to Abraham I'm just trying to get you get a point as we go along okay turn us oh god of our salvation and cause thine anger toward us to cease will thou be angry with us forever even though he made the promise to Abraham they still a problem right right right even though the promise was made to Abraham is still a prophet right all right wil thou be angry with us forever Willl thou draw out thine anger to all generations will thou not revive us again that thy people may rejoice in thee show us thy mercy O Lord and grant us thy salvation now listen I will hear what the Lord will speak for he will speak peace unto his people and to his Saints but let them not turn again to Folly surely his salvation is nigh to them n them that fear Him That Glory May dwell in our land mercy and Truth are met together righteousness and peace have kissed each other truth shall spring out of the earth and righteousness shall down from heaven yay the Lord shall give that which is good and our land shall yield her Increase righteousness shall go before him and she shall shall set us in the way of his steps you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now these are a few got these go out and these are about 10 copies of where we pick up from so if anybody didn't get this mornings anybody didn't get this mornings get them from Brother Don there I just ran some because we're going to have to jump with two parts on one message okay I didn't get through this morning so I chose not to repeat a lot because I believe you got the point but we will cover what we have to and then we will uh use part notes from the morning message and some that we had in for this afternoon now I hope you was understanding what I was been trying to bring about you know the soul of an individual but I believe your soul is the real you I believe it's greater than your body amen is greater than your spirit part of you amen because it's the real you it is the part that God chose to make in His image and in creating It In His Image we know what the image of God is he is a spiritual being so what did he create in the Garden there you know we're created there as we call it in the garden but before the foundation of the world he created a spiritual man and that spiritual man is called the theop the Loos the things of the order of the Prophet is doing and and there stood almighty God in a form called the theoy called the son of God the Loos the as the prophet said like a child playing before the father's door and he begins to say Let There be you know and his first creation we know from Brother random was what was angels and they worshiped him and that made him God all right somewhere prior to that existence of that part which is before the foundation of the world the prophet of God said that that theophany man was created right so we can see that he stood out and he said this morning he said Let There Be Right the world and things begin to come into being now I don't believe in but one Eternal God Amen it's impossible to have more than one God because you you would mess up up see because there's only one that can be Eternal and your great doctrine of the denominations like the Baptist Etc say that it's God in three persons co-equal and co-eternal now how can that be right how can you be co-equal and co-eternal and yet being a son all right see in that those things are are incorrect but see God stood there and created the world and all the things and created all of it and then he created a man in his own image right all right and that man was a one many member bodied man is the best way that I can describe it and in doing that we'll get to it eventually that it'll come down to the body of Christ being a one membered I mean one many membered body called The Bride of Jesus Christ all right but yet I'm wanting to hold a point to where we can look at it and see that that that Soul being the real you and even in its Fallen estate it is so real until the body can be just throwed out on the ground you know and rock right but yet God Made A Way and his great plan to have a place for every person that would ever be a living Soul that's right to go to Y to abide there for the time and to those that are not saved it would be called a Celestial body theoy right because it means a body all right and it can be it will be a place and it is the the uh Fifth Dimension where the center dead are at there's a place to abide and then all you know there is another place that has the prophet said that's going downward there's another place that's going upward soever born again Christian then would have a place that they would go to if they pass on right and that would be called Souls under the altar now not to say how long how long to avenge our blood but see the brother random is so specific till he can divide a point right down the line and we run ourselves crazy trying to understand but be careful and watch what he says the fifth seal Jew says be says how long how long to avenge our blood but the souls under the altar the angel of the Lord referred to it as calling it Souls under the altar saying how long how long that's how close it is that is the bride of Christ that has passed on and they had a place to go to in that place is their theophany which is your soul but but I believe ever born again believer your soul then is your theophany dwelling in you now I know and we will take it up the Lord willing Wednesday to go further into the depth of it I know what is taught basically by quote the people of the message from what brother brandham says about that uh your theophany is in heaven you know waiting for you well I if I was you I'd go read that scripture in 1 Corinthians 51 and if you'll notice very carefully the reading of the scriptures if this Earthly Tabernacle were that's two questions one is asking you a question the other one is stating something as a future Point were but it the point I want you to see is it says that it's Eternal in the heavens right all right now we might have believ Mom and Daddy or preacher so and so or whatever his name was or whoever we going to talk about and believe that one day we good bad disbelief you know that well we we don't really know for certain but one day we're going to go to heaven and be Eternal well that was all right for today's gone by right this is the time not to think about going to heaven to become Eternal but to think about heaven coming here to make us Eternal amen all right right so we're in a different time they had their day they had their times and their thoughts and God winked at to ignorance but now he commands us to believe his word all right so then I'm not talking about eternity somewhere else I'm talking about eternal life in your soul by the new birth all right and that way then your soul is your theophany you say well well what about well then do you have eternal life amen right if you have eternal life dwelling in you then that's exactly why it stated because if it's beyond the curtain of time it's eternal life all right and you have one Eternal in the heavens so is you got two eternals we read a quote there this morning from the prophet or gave where he said you don't believe in two Eternal lives do you he said that'd be hard to explain or that is hard to explain cuz there's only one Eternal and that's God Amen all right that's why we need the new birth amen we need God's own life to come and live in us all right and that was the point I was trying to get us to see this morning see there was Adam created Body Spirit and soul of man and then God breed in his nostrils the breath of eternal life right they never done it to anybody else right down through there because everybody born after then received natural life all right he's so specific on Blasphemous names he said said especially don't use the word especially it won't come up on your computer he say especially into Adam the breath of eternal life he said not what nature done right so we look at nature and we say Well when the baby's born nature gives you a soul what is nature anybody want to describe nature I thought there was only one nature and that was God and I thought there was only one that could create a soul now and doing that then let's get on to a point see that part of you that's real is what God is working on right he's not working on your body to try to save your body that will be taken care of in this end time message by the the the the thing that we still on Ephesians that you're predestinated in this day to adoption right all right this is the only age it's predestinated to a change of the body all right see we're in the age that that's to predestinate and I thought we believe that the word of God came predestinated eternally right so it's going to happen in this age somebody's going to be changed because God predetermined it right he predetermined in the days of Martin Luther that man would stand there and preach the just shall live by faith he done it that's right the man wouldn't predestinate eternally but the word was we're destinated to come to that place of eternal life right here okay amen now see then I believe your soul is your theophany that's right if you're a sinner it's a place to go to your soul it will go somewhere the prophet covered that Jesus went and preached to the soul that was in prison that's right and he saw the people he could describe what they look like he saw the women out there in the the uh pennies coming up and he said that was exactly the same ones he saw in Hell right the people the soul of an individual is not just a spooky float around you know we're beyond that even your Prophet thought in his early life that he said what would it be like he said I could see brother Neville but he said I couldn't shake his hand he said because his hands would be in the grave but he said now through when he went beyond the curtain of time he come back he saw what it was right so then it come out to the right place see now there's only one eternal life amen all right I don't ask you to say Amen because you might want to say ohe me the next statement I make all right so just you agree yourself until do what you want to but see there's only one eternal life then there's only one eternal theophany amen right there's never been 10 50 100 milon whatever no no there's never been but one Eternal theophany if we're not a part of God's own life within us by the new birth we do not have eternal life I don't care what we think what we claim how we holler we believe the message that we do all of these things all of that is well and good but eternal life is the thing I'm concerned with if I make you mad in body you know your spiritual being because that I am so Stern about what I think I'm sorry I don't want to be but there's one thing about it the Bible says them that watch after your souls amen I'm concerned with your soul you get mad at me you leave you do what you want to that's between you and your God that's right but I'm going to try my best to preach salvation to you and I to deliver us amen amen and to bring about a change of the body all right that's as much as I can say all right we covered this morning that before we could have eternal life before Adam had eternal life God had to breathe into Adam eternal life right go to blasphemian 9 27 I gave it to you this morning it's on your notes 27 and don't I'm not going to read it now so don't go to it to read it now but go read them when you get a change that we are right a tri being Body Spirit and soul but the soul was the part that was created in the image of God right that's right not the body it was created in the image of animal right yep there Adam was standing being there in the the garden and he had eternal life in his soul because God placed into Adam a part of that Genesis 126 and 27 man that's right which to me that Genesis 126 let's see if you can get this and that Genesis 126 and 27 man wouldn't the creation of God right it's God amen amen now swallow real good you awake okay so Genesis 1 126 and 27 would be the same logos theophany that came out of the out of God in the beginning amen absolutely or else you got two theop that's right yes but brother Dale you mean you going to bring it down to that eternal life in you and I is right exactly where I'm going to bring it that eternal life that's in us with the eternal life that stood in the garden and created the world now you tell me there's two or three Eternal lives and I'll tell you that you got a problem mainly between your ears all right see but what happened to Adam God breeded into Adam or put into Adam part right see of his own life and the reason I said part is like I tried to explain it this morning Moses you got too much trouble Moses take off and let somebody else have a part of it took the spirit off of Moses and put it on 70 and it left Moses with no less Spirit that's what your Prophet said every person in the world today could receive eternal life if they would and you know that God wouldn't be no smaller God would be greater that's right because that's what he wants Adam in the garden remember this morning was what Adam in the garden is what God wants of all his children here on Earth amen a man standing there that his body was not Eternal his Spirit was a creation from God permitted the prophet said in the situation brought into to the man and a soul that had been made Eternal amen by the very Breath of God now I don't have time to get it we'll get to it bring it back to you but on Blasphemous names right in our close to where you're reading with your notes if you'll keep reading you'll find brother brandham saying that the Church of the Living God is born by the Breath of God right amen right right right amen and he gives the scripture there where Jesus breathed on him and said receive ye the Holy Ghost he said Church born by the Breath of God they asked him the question about it in other words did those people get that eternal life right there when Jesus breathed on he said no it was a promise they got it on the day of Pentecost it was a promise right there you and I are promised and listen I know how far that goes too cuz I know on down on the page you keep reading and you'll find see when this church is molded up into the image statue of perfect man he said God will breathe upon upon that church by the Breath of God I'm looking further forward to that when all of us come to the adoption and The Headstone God will breathe upon the bride again and she'll be changed that's right because it'll bring eternal life into being okay now but there Adam was in the garden and even being part of God in his soul and even Eve brother brand said they were same in theoy so you can argue all you want to but Eve was a person amen and God gave her eternal life amen in her soul also you so we don't have a quote for that I got enough for brother randam said she was in adamant theophany right so if Adam had Eternal theophany she had one too it was just a division but when she was taken from him and put in flesh then the fall could come right y but you know Adam fell amen now didn't fall to death as a eternally taken away or taking away of the eternal life from his soul he fell to Natural death if I die today are you going to say that I'm dead that I fell from eternal life I hope you don't think that way cuz I wouldn't say it about you I would say your soul is beyond the curtain of time Eternal waiting on a time to come back to the body see and that's what happen happened to Adam and Eve in the garden but nobody could be born and I'm trying to hurry up now nobody could be born then like they were in their creation something had to happen they could man could be led of God man through the Old Testament he could be so anointed until David would go out and and just you know kill a bar and and kill a a line and and and kill a giant because of the anointing on him but yet he could turn right back around and go to the bed of basba right and commit adultery with his one of his 30 mighty men that would would give his own life for him right he could do that why because he was not born again right there was no way for the soul of man I mean the soul of an individual a person anybody back there could come to eternal life right the animal life could could only cover right because there was no soul in the animal life all right we something had to take place though all right eternal life would have to come into a human being and that human being would have to give his own life right it was not enough for the anointing to come on Jesus on the River Jordan and go off of him in the Garden of Gethsemane that could not bring you eternal life as we were talking about last night of mzc mzc could not give you eternal life I believe the mzd inside of that man that ate the calf as we said this morning I believe that was eternal life amen CU brother R said that's almighty God had no beginning and no ended I believe that but there was no way to release that life to get it to come back so then had to wait until a time that a baby could be born upon this Earth and that baby would be born almighty God not born as men are teaching today that he was born just a man and then he becomes God on the River Jordan no the Bible said he was born Lord the Christ the Bible says Emmanuel God With Us the prophet said your God with no teeth laying in a cradle that's how he would describe you why because it was almighty God laying there amen he came became anointed on the River Jordan for the ministry that he was to carry wonderful am a great event took place that's right but then that anointing would have to leave him in the garden because there was no way for him to die without anointing on him right see they couldn't touch him he could just walk right out of the crowd they were ready to Stone him right he just turned walk out there's nothing that could do with him until that anointing left him but that anointing didn't take his soul out right that anointing didn't take the spirit out of him cuz he said on the on the cross into thy hand I commend my spirit that's right he cried out my soul lord into thy hand I commend you see a man had to come that would be as I said at the ending this morning then ody Jesus was is my brother but he's My Kinsman y but you better remember you was born with one more kin to you than Jesus Christ you was born kin folks to the devil according to the Book of Ruth and the prophet's message C the message of Grace you better go back and study the message study the Book of Ruth there was one more kin folks to Ruth than Boaz was he had to offer him a chance to redeem but he ref refused it cuz he was the devil and the devil can't cast out a devil to do you try to make you a Christian so he had to refuse it then Boaz could come forth to be the kinsman redeemer so body to body he's my brother body to body He's My Kinsman right Spirit to Spirit as I said this morning he can anoint me and not great things can take place you can see Visions you can see things happen you can see the sick healed and dead raised you can see all kind of things under that anointing but under that anointing that can fall upon anointed ones as well and and that doesn't mean you got to be a Christian for it to work on you right I want to say something right here uh about 7:30 yesterday morning it happened blisten I I'm not a nervous person I've never been one and I come here I'm no more nervous than it would be it doesn't matter me if it's two people or 10,000 it don't change a bit that's right what people don't understand about me they say but I'm just so nervous I know that's your makeup but when every once in a while something happens and I get real nervous so somewh along about 7:30 might have been closer to 8 or closer to 7:00 I become I'm real real nervous and I just stop and pray because I'm not spiritual enough to know what's going on I'm just spiritual enough to know something's going on somewhere so then I stop and pray so what you know it happens that way every once in a while but you know that's part of my life and doings all right but listen that anointing can be there when you're a sinner too like that sure that's right so don't make it you you're Christian cuz that's an anointing no cuz anointing can be on your spirit you can have the baptism brother Brandon said genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit on your spirit and still be lost y amen so then body to body he's my brother Spirit to Spirit he can anoint but he can anoint all these others to do their things he anointed Benny hen and he walked right off the platform right out in mid iron turn around walk back you deny it how no but see then they soul to soul that's all I want to deal with right cuz God ain't trying to save my body that'll be taken care of he ain't trying to save my spirit he's trying to save my soul amen he's trying to deal with your soul to get you to stand still long enough to listen to him amen and let him talk to you that's right because that Soul no matter what you think about it it's born in the image image of almighty God right even in a lost condition that still Longs for a savior still worships right all right so then it's body to body Spirit to Spirit soul to soul am the soul is the thing God is dealing with now amen it will come to the point of the the spirit in the body later on all right but to do that God would have to make a way that his children could be able to come to the place of Salvation all right you could cover a lot of things about what it would be and whatever it is but let's just take something there in that scripture have you ever really just studied the Psalms look back at it Psalms 85 have you ever just really you know got into that this message goes back brother Mo preached it about probably 1971 or might even before then you know and it really thrilled my soul and and it still Thrills me you know to think about it but see the psalmist David is describing as I said that God has made a way right by the time this had taken place the they were probably in natural captivity maybe I don't know if that point there but he said he brought them back he's forgiven the iniquity right cuz he gave away for the iniquity to be covered of the people and he covered their sin that was the blood of bulls and goats it could cover sin but it could not eradicate it right all right so then not being able to eradicate it he could take away verse three the Wrath the blood atonement of the animal would cover the man to where the wrath of God would be turned away are you following me under the blood of bulls and goats the wrath of of God would be turned away and he turned from his fierceness of destroying I remember there in the Bible you know he was he was fixing to kill a bunch of them and and Moses said Aaron grab your sensor and run among the people and preventure you might be able to make an atonement right and you know that God seen that the way done and run through there that sensor and they do and you know what it turned his rth right y he turned away I remember I used to preach off of it you find 10 times from the time the children of Israel left Egypt to the when they come to Cades barnea and God said 10 times you sinned against me Shy destroyed thousands of them and the doings and all kind of things but he was still ready to take them to the promised land but when they got there and wouldn't believe Joshua and Caleb right that was as far as God was going to go he said to the Wilderness you go until all of you that it C tith in this Doctrine right are going to die so you look at it in the message of the hour you'll see why we're here he has let us go this 40 years to be able to kill off all of those that's all see but they knows how to typ he just don't like to get you think I want I get arrogant you think I get hateful no I try to be real soft right cuz you could preach a long time about all this first meeting was in in Jeffersonville I come back around brother Mo I was just dying to laughing and he said what are you laughing about and we went to a ministers meeting that they were having up in the old uh voice of God recording that old building the uh Armory and uh you know he said what are you laughing about I said well I went over in this group and I was listening and I said over on this side was a bunch of old people of the message you know my age and different things you know and been in the message a while you know and and I said they were all typing that they were the Joshua and the Caleb that stayed with Moses but all these others is dying off because they wouldn't Joshua and Caleb I said left iron and went over and that's not no joke is happening went over the other group and I were all the young ones in the message you know come up and hav't seen the prophet you know they were typing and said all them old heads has got to die off cuz all of 20 Ag and over got to die you know and we're the young ones that's going into the land and I'm not joking it happened cuz that's what people thinks but you get the point of what I'm saying first four he says turn us oh god of our salvation and cause thine anger toward us to cease he could cease still no matter what if there was an atonement there was anger in God about Mankind because mankind was not in the place that it needs to be Willl thou verse 5 be angry with us forever or for forever will thou draw out thine anger to all generations Lord I'm pleading the Cause right some way find something that can take place to take away this from us and cause your anger to turn from us your fierceness Willl thou not revive us again that thy people may rejoice in thee he was concerned wasn't he show us thy mercy oh Lord and grant us thy salvation Lord come on the scene and make a way we can be saved David said Thy word have I hid in my heart but brother brandham said what he needed was the baptism of the Holy Ghost that would have kept him from that adultery all right listen I will hear what the Lord will speak right now the psalmist David is coming to a point he said I will hear where the psalmist here I get them mixed up whether it's David or or Solomon then you just put the right one in there I hear what I will hear what the Lord will speak for he will speak peace unto his people right and to his Saints but let them not turn again to Folly Lord do something that'll bring us to the place that we won't won't keep falling back in this garbage again that we do every time you take us out you kill off all the amorites we were talking about it last night in the Bible you know you ever noticed I believe it's the amorites you ever noticed in the Bible that he said destroy the amorites utterly destroy men women and children all they go out and Destroy every one of them two chapters later they're fighting amorites right where' they come from they you said well he growed up over there well that take a couple hundred years to bring up for enough no you know who d amorites are you know who I want to destroy I'm looking at it right the Amorite is the flesh you destroy it one day the next day it's going to come alive you put it down one day the next day it's going to lead you and carry you into the wrong place so that's the Amorite the Bible is trying to destroy all right so this one surely he his salvation is not them that fear Him That Glory May dwell in all our land now watch mercy and Truth are met together now where did that happen at right there's not but one place that that can take place and that's in Jesus Christ that's right amen the only one place that mercy and Truth can ever meet right the only way anybody can ever be saved is got to receive that one that was there that would be both mercy and truth right now listen what he said righteousness and peace have kissed each other when did that take place righteousness and peace kissed each other when God and man became one in Jesus Christ to make a way that we could be saved truth shall spring what out of the earth where's the message of the hour Earth where did the thunder sound the prophet said they sounded on Earth righteousness and peace shall look down and excuse me and righteousness shall look down from heaven verse 13 righteousness shall go before him and Shall Set us in the way of his steps the only place that God could ever meet man the only place he could ever put his name we were listening to that the other day on Prophet preaching what a wonderful thing took place the day A man was born right that could give his life amen we have the only religion that there is is that it was totally totally impossible for our leader to not die he had to die we're the only religion there is that demanded that our leader die to be able to give his life you've heard brother around talk about the the people you know and the mohammadans and the people would say you know well you said you give us this Muhammad said he'd give it to us yeah but you said see Muhammad didn't die he did finally cuz he got so old but he didn't die to give his life for the people right but Jesus Christ had to die that was the day righteousness and peace kissed each other let's read it lamb and a dove 1956 9 9117 and when he come down many people bypass this scripture now listen to it but to me it's one of the outstanding scriptures of the Bible that when Heaven and Earth embraced when God came down in the form of a dove and went upon his son in the form of a lamb now where did that take place to a completion upon the River Jordan right come on when God and Christ become one when God in Christ became one when the the Dove came down on the lamb Heaven and Earth kissed each other God and man was reconciled together why it's one of the greatest moments the world ever had that when man and God was reconciled together the lamb and a Dove came together Jesus did become there on the River Jordan the fullness of the godhead bodily right it wasn't that he wasn't God before them right but there was some part about God that had not come into manifestation upon Earth that man that we call Jesus and soul was almighty God your Prophet says right in spirit he he was God he said in body he said he was a man so they got to get they got to have some kind of a special Revelation you know to make everybody get to really feeling you know to touch you and make you happy about something instead of believing the truth the truth is what makes me happy right you better believe if I told you today and I called your name and I said Donnie fush I've got in my pocket a check for you for $1 million what he say folks but I've got l and before me eternal life right the words of a prophet right the Bible eternal life what will we do with it Elisha the prophet 1956 10:02 in the evening now I'm just picking out part and I didn't have time to underline so you find it in the middle right about the middle he talks about God and his people he Tabernacle once in this pure under adulterated body of the Lord Jesus by virgin birth and that blood cell was broke and he made a way you couldn't do it you couldn't Merit it but he merited your rights and God after dwelling in Christ and giving himself as a ransom for reconciliation to bring man and God together and unite them together again when the lamb and Dove came together Heaven and Earth kissed Earth kissed man and God was reconciled that's what job wanted that's right y job said I would that some man could take my hand and the Hand of almighty God right the greatest wisdom man of all kind and said be able to bring them together that's exactly what happened in the Lord Jesus Christ you say brother Dale you just preached so deep bless no no right I preach too simple I'm talking about salvation right I'm talking about what you're supposed to enjoy yeah like I told you I went to a man's church one time preaching that you must be justified Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost to have the new birth and always seek God if you don't have it and if you do have it keep seek seing it until you find out for sure you got it the man got mad at me and offended at me and ain't never preached our sin CU he said I had my People based upon the word and you got them to seeking God I said I apologize for preaching something into your church that you didn't agree with but I will not apologize for trying to get the people to seek after God and I said I thought you believed in justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost to give you the new birth you see the truth kills don't god making his promise 1956 1209 a the morning service that was the greatest event this world has ever seen and will see until Christ and the church has United together again now that's the greatest event D until Christ and his church has United together again that when God and man became one Heaven and Earth embraced each other and kissed each other and settled the sin question forever is when the lamb Dove and the lamb United together one of the greatest that's when the the price when the greatest reconciliation that was ever made is when God and Christ United as one and friend let me tell you something we are God's lamb he likened us to sheep lamb and the dove 57 3:25 when this Dove came from the heavens that's e35 the meekest bird of all the heavens came to the meest animal on all the Earth Heaven and Earth kissed each other Heaven and Earth was United together God and man was reconciled in one body the Lord Jesus Christ certainly it was it was the god of Heaven in a form of the of Dove the Son of God in the form of lamb and the Dove came down on the lamb and ab Bood on him never just come down and lit and went away it stayed there the the lamb and the dove e67 God keeps his word 57 1 115 right down to the bottom you read all this others read I give it to you talk about to send you the things that takes place aren he said the things that I do shall you also greater than this or more than this shall you do for I go unto my father when he was here on Earth he didn't claim to be a great person he claimed only to be the son of man when he was here he was the son of God yet he was the son of man through Mary right he was the son of God by Mary listen that's good one he was God himself by Spirit God in Christ Heaven and Earth reconciled together when Earthly man born of a woman and the spirit of God dwelt in dwelt in him when the lamb and the Dove came together Heaven and Earth kissed each other and that's right on that great day hear you him 19583 one the evening service so it goes down talking about uh says and John Behold the Lamb of God that take away the sin of the world and I by record seeing the spirit of God like and John said Behold the Lamb of God had take away the sin of the world and I by record seeing the spirit of God like a dove when the dove settled down on the lamb Heaven and Earth embraced each other and kissed and Sinners and God was reconciled one more lamb and a dove 1960 805 oh what a confirmation to see a lamb and a dove come together Heaven and Earth United God and man united and one of the sins of the world was kissed away think and one of the the sins of the world was kissed away and all the roughness and all Death and All sorrow and all sickness was kissed away when the lamb and the dove become United together and do the same thing in you and it unites with you when the lamb and the dove comes together their Natures are the same all right now like I said people believe that being the River Jordan that Jesus wouldn't God until the River Jordan and then all once he become God and then God left him in the garden so who was he well he's just a man to see our brother Dale you've been reading it's proven you know what brother SE and show says is right what see that anointing had to leave him right amen but yet he was still Body Spirit and soul almighty God Amen if his soul left the body the body's dead if his Spirit left the body the body's dead he went for about 6 months well from this went three uh three and a half years with this anointing on him then it left him and then he was just a matter of just a few days probably from The Garden of Gethsemane where the Prophet said the anointing left him but what did it leave him well it left him just a man no he's born just a man amen the son of man what we just read right the body was a man that's my brother right but the soul is almighty God Amen you see before he could ever give us eternal life that anointing that left him in the garden could not give you eternal life right it can take you to eternal life one day in a change yes we will get to that it will take us that anointing is promised to come back in the end time Y and will take us to ET eternal life in a body amen yeah but you see mchz couldn't give you eternal life right it took God coming down in human flesh living in that human flesh and that Soul was the soul of almighty God and that Soul had to be tore out of that body he said Brother D you well we just read what brother r said know that body wanted to live you know that body on the cross wanted to live you know that body in the garden cried out if it be thy will let this cut tight from me MH y but said nevertheless amen thy will be done so what happened then let's read it this where we had to jump over to number 10 now in the evening service if you got the evening service notes go to number 10 all right which is the message Israel in Egypt PR in 1953 through 25 here he comes torn Riven Torn to Pieces it cost for you and I to have eternal life it cost the death of the Lord Jesus Christ a body that was beaten as the scripture says we didn't even want to look on brother brandham said he looked like a piece of hamburger meat if you've ever been seen this one of the what what is it where they show theion passion not down Atlanta now I'm talking about the video and it shows where he would beat up and cut up and all kind of things with the cat of nine tails but around said he look like a piece of hamburger meat cuz the devil had his opportunity and he sure went at it but it took every bit of that to bring that life out of that body right but you know man didn't kill sir am the Lord Jesus Christ amen all of their beatings and all of the things Paul even I think how many five times or how many times was it three times that he was beat 40 save one which they said if he hit you 40 times he kill you we had 39 Stripes two or three times but they couldn't kill him cuz God went through with it right God gave his life man brother randam said did not kill Jesus Christ that's right he said he gave his life amen he paid the price that's right there the only way it could be done so what happened torn Riven to Pieces what his soul went to God God blessed him then his soul but returned back in the form of the baptism of the holy ghost that comes into every believer okay there's the only way to get eternal life there was that one theophany 126 Man Standing on Earth amen the full of the godhead bodily right the 126 man the one that created all things was standing on Earth amen Y and he gave his life so it could come back to me and you to do as I said to Adam give us each one part of his own life listen then his soul returned back in the form of the baptism of the holy ghost that comes into every believer to sanctify clean up the Mind clean up the heart and leave a portion of the Holy Ghost in there here and there and when the Holy Ghost is given out that same holy spirit that brought the body of Jesus Christ out of the Grave will Rapture and that Covenant has to doveet tail as he tore there and gave the body went back to God and the Spirit came back to the Earth then your spirit will have to be the same be the same kind of spirit or it'll miss that place going together amen yes sir not because you make yourself but because something the love of God has swept into your soul and tore ever Earthly Idol out see it wasn't just his death right it's got to be our death amen y we got to die to ourself to be born again unconditional Covenant 1954 306 watch God was then in Spirit how could God be torn apart but one day God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us how could it be done it in spirit couldn't do it the Lord Jesus Christ the Emmanuel and then there at Calvary the Covenant God wrote with us he took the Christ to Calvary and tore him apart soul and body and he took his body up to set at the right hand of his majesty and sent the soul back here or the spirit on the earth to make a covenant to carry out the gospel Perfection 1957 4:19 right down at the very bottom but God himself came that his own Spirit which is the highest line of spirit there is can come back by the form of the baptism of the Holy Spirit to the worshipper through the blood of Christ and take him into the body who was that Queen of Sheba 19610 but when the life that was in an animal that died the life could not come back and be a spirit with the human being because it was animal life without a soul but when Jesus died it was the soul was a soul of God right now look it was a soul of God he didn't say it was God he said it just a soul of God when that cell was broke it Sanctified the church that the Holy Spirit could live in us who were sexually born then it's God above us God With Us now it's God in us amen that's right so you see what I'm talking about heaven and earth kiss when God and man become one an opportunity to be able to relinquish the life the soul that it could come back Upon A a Believer and give that believer eternal life all right see then what is it ever born again believer every Born Again believer your soul is your theophany it has eternal life right right if has eternal life there's only one eternal life and that's God's own life that's right so then the Soul was divided on the day of Pentecost into 120 amen the next time it happened it was 3,000 right and how many millions has come down through time and trillions or whatever that's right but it's still that one Eternal God that can give eternal life so if you have eternal life your soul is now your theophany because it's got an upward pull you said but I thought I had one in heaven waiting we'll get to that Wednesday because you better think about it right amen see because mankind has always wanted to go to heaven to get eternal life right that's right right amen cuz he don't just don't want to face up to it and to see that we must receive eternal life right here if we don't receive eternal life here there is no heaven to go to right because see the other notes that I got on the message is what I thought we believed we read where the Prophet said and the Bible says it that righteousness look down from heaven truth sprang up out of the earth amen I thought we believe by the new birth that we were resurrected according to the book of Ephesians that we were resurrected already now sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus I thought Heaven and Earth had come together right M that's right I thought Heaven and Earth was supposed to kissing you and me amen I thought that's what the new birth was was Heaven and Earth coming together in this realm you're in the condition that God could come down and give eternal life to me while I'm living here right but one of these days we going to get eternal life no no no no no that's right if you don't have eternal life you're lost exactly right amen and your theophany is going down whether you like it or not right your Celestial body is going downward right you may rejoice and Shout Glory Hallelujah and claim to believe everything right but it's still going down amen but if you get born again then the pool starts upward yeah and listen then if the pull starts upward the prophet said your soul is not complete he's talking about in the New Birth you know the new birth your Soul's not complete you know why right cuz you only have the earnest right y That's right look behind me on the Statue of a perfect man and you'll see down at the bottom of the pyramid is talking about faith that's your new birth but up at the top is love that when you're born again you have eternal life and that's your soul be in your theophany but the positive of your theophany is the finish of all things when we walk off of this earth and the change of the body amen because that's what's pulling us amen what's pulling you in the upward current it's easy to understand and the center his is going down and what's pulling him is what he is right right but in eternal life what's going upward is what's pulling us right think on these things think on it pray about it Lord do I have eternal life I believe the message I believe the Bible come on but do I have eternal life that's right and I've said it and I'll keep saying it till the day I die I'd rather be seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost right right and die and God tell me I had it all the time then for me to spend all of my life not seeking after God and find out at the end of it I didn't have him you said well can that happen brother random said the Sunday school teacher lady that's she thought she was right thought Sunday school he said but when she begin to die since she begin to scream and said you've lied to me did you told me I was saved and said now brother R said when all of the elements of the Human begin to break away since she saw her real self right y she said I'm lost of course you know what the preacher said give her another hpo to shut her up that's what the doctor's done instead of saying give her one to pull her out of that let her scream and holler let's pray for her soul give her another shot to put her out of it and sent that Soul off to a hell right because he wouldn't admit it wrong it's hard for a human being to say I'm wrong now words out of your mouth is cheap oh you say I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry that's easy to say Ain it but can you down in your heart say I'm sorry I say every day God I'm sorry I'm sorry I hav't studied I'm sorry I haven't been the person I need to be that's right I'm sorry Lord forgive me help me save me cuz if we don't have eternal life here there is no eternal life there is no Eternal theoy up in heaven right right you mean you you don't have it till you get there that's what you're saying see because the the scripture in 2 Corinthians 5:1 said it's Eternal in the heavens so if you got one Eternal in the heavens but if you don't have it here is matching pieces how you expect to go we got to have eternal life here the soul of almighty God to come into our soul and make our soul Eternal now our soul is at theophany with an upward Cur to the positive of his mind somebody somewhere is going to match that amen amen and we'll walk off this Earth back on these things Heaven and Earth kissed each other when God and man become one so Heaven and Earth kissed each other the day you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen yes sir the day you receive the soul of God in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost to give you eternal life that's Heaven and Earth kissed amen righteousness and peace come together what a joyful time to have to see what eternal life really is than on these things let's stand together we're going into the communion think on these things all right 1 Corinthians 11 verse 23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break in and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had s saying this cup is cup is the New Testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do you the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasen of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat t one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together under condemnation the rest will I set in order when I come anybody got anything you want to get off your mind before we go into the communion now well the Sam I've been having a tough time now for several weeks I pray considerably about it the Lord put on me yesterday possibly I had not repented and apologized to the church for my adultery when I married at 20 years or 19 years ago so if I didn't get it right then I want to be right now I do apolog anybody else pray for these you said what I didn't hear what he said what do you want to do go garbage can and talk about it later forgive him Hallelujah when you ask for forgiveness you don't have to know what the person's asking for to be able to pray for forgiveness amen pray God forgive them amen that's right take it for that that's right go ahead brother Rick I come here to share all my time pass my time all here remember these anybody else before we go um most of the time I am kind of patient people but I've met a few people in the last little while that has made me so I mean present myself in a way that I should not amen anybody else this church just ask Church forgive me for some of the things that I Lord forgive me for the things that I have in my heart sometimes and I fail and and strumble and my h forgive me Grand the things at home sometimes that I fail to do and need forgiveness when I was mentioning about all the couples that were helping us it's just something simple but brother Danny and sister Joyce I didn't say their name and I don't want to leave anybody else they just a part of us working and I forgot been talking the whole time I need tell everybody amen amen amen sister Anna I know sometimes I stay at a church but I know how the devil torments me in my mind and I allow him to torment me and instead of coming on and getting ready for just coming on I've allowed him to do I apologize to church I want to also apologize for any um problem that I may have caused in the chat or to my husband also because I also want to make sure I'm right before God and amen I'd like to apologize to First Church also not Christian World OPP I deal with people and um me I'm not stronger on the word and most of the time that's in my life and I always ask the Lord to shut my mouth say to harm hinder anybody I could present myself a lot better show myself stud being more than I should be cuz that's what I'm supposed to and all and I ask the church to give it for for most lawfulness and my family also anybody else the Bible says for us to take a moment and just pray and that's to pray one for another pray for the ones that have asked for forgiveness and for helping things you know to lead and guide and everything else and let the love of God then be in our hearts that where it all be done so let's just take a few moments of Silent prayer and just pray we ask it all in Jesus name amen and I'm number one one to say that I'm sorry maybe I spent my time studying to try to help you but that's not enough but I want to see a love of God Among Us here in this church that's righten and to you that would say you have problems and you've laid out a church I love you and the only thing I say to you that's wrong thing abely you need to be in church if you're sick you need to be in church if it's any humanly possible you need to come to church amen I thought this was a Healing Place amen that's right well I just come up and be prayed for get up and walk back out and get in your car and go home but come and be prayed for put forth an effort amen and you'll see God move on the scene yes sir I told you when I come out of the hospital years ago brother Mo said we're going to have Friday Saturday and Sunday services and doctor told me to go home the back was messed up he said you go home and you go to bed I'll let you go I said I'll go home and I ain't telling you about going to bed I came home and I come right straight up here and I sit in this church with a heating pad on my back for three services dying with pain but you know what God touched me now what what if I stayed at home laid up in the bed this just what I say don't never stay out of church because there's something wrong what was it the sister told her husband that you know said you're a young convert and and you uh you uh you were used to doing things and said you may go back and fall and do it again but said don't stay away said come home I'll help you pray through she didn't say come home and I'll throw you out of the house you said come home and I'll help you pray through that's why we're here for to help each other pray through that's nobody don't look down on nobody else because of what to do because we all do our things anyway we all have a problem am let's just be right okay let's do it that way father the Bible said took bread and blessed it father we thank you for this bread it's been made for this purpose today and we ask you to is sanctify it and sanctify the partakers we know that this is only in representation of your body and we believe you father but we ask you to just sanctify each one here that we may all be together as one in you bless each one in Jesus name amen these symbols mean a whole lot more than what we think it does anyway but yet we don't put our emphasis on symbols we put our emphasis on the word but still this is supposed to represent the body of the Lord Jesus Christ and that's supposed to be representing the word and we're supposed to eat this and they were so back there commanded of certain way to eat until if they didn't follow it that way you know it could be death that's right but they followed What the Lord told them and it was life so let's do what God says and just believe it and accept it seen people healed taking communion amen that's right why because it was what their minds or thoughts were on so just remember this it may be a symbol but what I love about it is is the the wedding supper is going to be taking to communion father we thank you for this wine that's gone through the process now changing to where it is it gets better every day and we know that this the Tope of thy Holy Spirit Lord the life that you gave for each one of us we ask you to sanctify the wine and partakers and as we eat the little piece of bread we drink this little small amount of wine that even tomorrow that will be blood cells in our body that will literally be creating life within each one of us we ask you to just bless and guide each one as we partake of this in Jesus name amen come morning I walk by the river I'll rest me the ever tree I'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning there story for me sometimes I'm despised and rejected and I question oh Father how then I take one more look at Mount Calvary and it gives me the strength to go home come morning I walk by the river I'll rest the ever green dree I'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me what about a a people that knows the truth of God's word we're not in the days when we wondered if this was this or that was that or whatever in the days when we can understand the truth you shall know the truth and the truth will set you free see doctrines and ideas bind Creeds bind they don't set you free that's why brother R said the true Prophet would only try to bind you to the word right but around never tried to binds you to himself he tried to bind us to the word of almighty god well then that's what any true Minister ought to be you ought to be concerned with one thing trying to get the people bound to the word that's right get it to where that word has got the preeminence in each one of our hearts and lives that's right that we can see God made manifest among us we think on these things thank on the word I all protect again even be seated WR we read our scripture about the foot worship CU that's a firmly firm what we believe right amen we believe in water baptism we believe in communion we believe in foot washing as we believe those are the ordinances of God okay John the 13th chapter verse 2 and suffer being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas this carot Simon son betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and he was come from God and went to God he rided from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and GED himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel where with he was GED then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said un him Lord th thou wash my feet
