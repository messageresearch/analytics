[1:56] it's been a wonderful time to follow her
[1:59] all the way through the battle and
[2:00] everything but I still want to see him
[2:02] and then we don't it'll be there Amen
[2:05] for that
[2:06] did you see about in the house of the
[2:07] Lord good to see everybody on the
[2:08] internet system and we want to thank
[2:10] everybody for the doing of working and
[2:14] getting the internet system part to
[2:16] where that that does work and keeps it
[2:18] going to work you know the people can
[2:20] listen and you know if they can't get it
[2:23] right then they can't at least get it
[2:25] the services you know from from the
[2:29] church one website and so that's doing
[2:32] it and we're getting a good mini I guess
[2:38] you call it connections or on it so
[2:40] that's that's making it work out good
[2:42] you know and everything in the to where
[2:45] we can do amen okay okay if you like
[2:50] turning your scripture let's go to first
[2:51] Corinthians 2 and then we'll go to
[2:55] Philippians 2 and just think on these
[2:59] things Lord willing or remember Richard
[3:02] and Aaron is driving back from up with
[3:04] his dad's they've been up there working
[3:06] trying to fix a handicap ramp where he
[3:09] can go out and I all and just remember
[3:11] that and we will try to get ahold of
[3:13] Aaron to see about the services
[3:16] Wednesday you know if not we'll jump
[3:19] over call brother Louise and we'll have
[3:20] one of them in there so we try to run
[3:24] the search and you know the church
[3:25] that's the way we was running it because
[3:27] they don't need to changing any rules or
[3:30] regulations you just keep on going we'll
[3:32] get right down the line okay first
[3:35] corinthians in philippians father we
[3:37] thank you for this day in your grace
[3:39] Lord we thank you for your understand
[3:41] thank you for being you and we just ask
[3:44] you now that you'd come on the scene and
[3:46] just open our understanding of that word
[3:49] that father we may follow into thy
[3:52] footsteps and to see you Lord walking in
[3:56] the light and then we can follow in
[3:58] those steps and walk with you have you a
[4:01] remember the sick ones among us brother
[4:03] dick brother Al and for brother Dale and
[4:07] for brother Colley and all of the
[4:08] different ones of many many sicknesses
[4:10] and things ry for their back hurt and
[4:13] earn things and just touch each one and
[4:15] Lord remember them around the world all
[4:18] of this whole situation is going on and
[4:20] we just plead to blood for everybody cuz
[4:22] they're human beings you know and we
[4:25] believe that we believe your bride is
[4:26] protected by the blood the it the blood
[4:30] is applied to all if we believe it and
[4:33] we think you have your way now as we
[4:34] read your word you come and speak to our
[4:36] hearts in Jesus name so we're going to
[4:45] 1st Corinthians 2 we go 14 through 16
[4:51] but the natural man receiveth not the
[4:54] things of the Spirit of God for they are
[4:56] foolishness unto Him neither can he know
[5:00] them because they are spiritually
[5:02] discerned but he that is spiritual now
[5:06] like this judges all things know what
[5:10] yet he himself is judged of no man
[5:13] because he they if if he's if his
[5:16] judgment is correct it would be the
[5:18] judgment of God so then no man can come
[5:21] forth and and try to add anything to or
[5:24] mess it up or anything for who has known
[5:26] the mind of the Lord that he may
[5:29] instruct him but we have the mind of
[5:33] Christ okay
[5:34] now keep that in mind we have the mind
[5:36] of Christ now let's go to Philippians 2
[5:40] and we'll go over to verse 1 if there if
[5:45] there be therefore any consolation in
[5:48] Christ if any comfort of love if any
[5:52] fellowship of the Spirit if any bowels
[5:55] of mercy
[5:56] fulfil you my joy that you be
[5:59] like-minded having the same love being
[6:01] of one Accord of one mind and I notice
[6:06] the scripture speaks a lot about the
[6:07] mind doesn't it let nothing be done
[6:09] through strife or vainglory but in
[6:12] lowliness of mind let each esteem other
[6:14] better than themselves look not every
[6:18] man on his own things but every man also
[6:21] on the things of others let this mind be
[6:24] in you which was in Christ Jesus who
[6:28] being in the form of God thought it not
[6:30] robbery to be equal with God but made
[6:34] himself of no reputation and took upon
[6:36] him the form of a servant and was made
[6:39] in the likeness of men being found in
[6:43] fashion as a man he humbled himself and
[6:46] became obedient unto death even the
[6:49] death of the Cross you may be seated the
[6:52] Lord had his blessing to the reading of
[6:56] the word so we're still in our thought I
[7:03] want to hold that it's part of what
[7:07] we're doing we're still in our part and
[7:09] thinking about the series part that
[7:13] we've been running through and we just
[7:15] changed titles but we're still kind of
[7:17] going with the point of thinking about
[7:20] that they without us cannot be made
[7:22] perfect we're still connected to that
[7:25] and I hope this will you know the life's
[7:29] message of this message and it may be
[7:31] another one who anchor that in to a
[7:34] position that you can see why they
[7:38] without us cannot be made perfect more
[7:40] into view the one thing that I want you
[7:44] to think about is you know even God is
[7:50] not complete without you the Prophet
[7:53] said all right see because we're part of
[7:56] him because he's you know us living in
[7:59] us all right see then he's doing that
[8:02] and that's the thing that we've been
[8:04] hitting the past couple of services that
[8:07] that makes a great
[8:09] mr. e and now it's unveiled on to us by
[8:13] way of the life stay messenger to show
[8:16] us what those are and we can talk about
[8:18] the engrafting of the Gentiles and
[8:21] things like that it's coming in as the
[8:24] mystery and that's fine let's do it but
[8:27] that's not the fool mystery see the full
[8:30] mystery is in Christ the mystery
[8:32] according the way I read it is where the
[8:35] Prophet said she's part of the mystery
[8:37] and she must be revealed in other words
[8:40] she's part of the mystery honor what is
[8:43] it then down through time God was
[8:46] waiting to a place not to just now
[8:50] listen to the wording for you not to
[8:52] just say engrafted Gentiles that was
[8:56] great that's wonderful this wonderful
[8:58] spot don't misunderstand me but the
[9:00] greater point that I've been trying to
[9:02] drive at is one thing you know the very
[9:07] fact that Christ living in you by the
[9:14] new birth is not listen to the word it's
[9:18] greater than to be sayin grafted in
[9:22] because it's you know in grafting is
[9:25] you've got to do some things and all
[9:26] that's great
[9:27] it won't come forth produces the product
[9:29] but to me the great mystery that was
[9:33] hidden before the foundation of the
[9:34] world and come all the way down and the
[9:36] Prophet said we'll see it here in our
[9:38] day is what that the bride of Jesus
[9:41] Christ is part of the mystery she's just
[9:46] not an engrafted thing
[9:50] she's a very part of him think that
[9:54] before the foundation of the world he
[9:57] knew all of this and would have it in
[9:59] order he had it in his mind and it would
[10:01] come out to be were that the church the
[10:06] Bride of Christ then everything would be
[10:09] waiting upon that bride to come to her
[10:13] place that's the point I drove in trying
[10:16] to get you to see it in the message that
[10:18] see they without us no matter who it is
[10:20] it'd be the Old Testament
[10:22] or it'd be the new testament and in even
[10:25] we found there in our studies if you
[10:28] want it we'll read it in a minute where
[10:29] he says that even God is not complete
[10:32] without you and me
[10:34] well now that's a great mystery you
[10:38] better believe that's a mystery I can
[10:40] just see people you know on the internet
[10:42] and they're there listening to that and
[10:44] you're making that statement and say
[10:46] where is that I had you know oh we don't
[10:49] we just don't believe it like that well
[10:51] why not
[10:53] why can't we believe that we're part of
[10:56] the mystery if it's a three-fold mystery
[10:59] according to Christ the mystery of God
[11:00] revealed all God reporting the crime all
[11:02] Christ into the church take her back to
[11:04] the Garden of Eden within she's part of
[11:07] the mystery and that's the thing that
[11:09] was hidden before the world sure the
[11:13] engrafting of the gentiles was hidden
[11:15] into that point that it you know would
[11:17] not be understood until it would come
[11:19] down to that time but still it's it's
[11:23] not what the point that I'm trying to
[11:25] get us to see that if the bride is part
[11:29] of the mystery then she must be revealed
[11:34] and the whole message then is revealing
[11:39] the mystery you know not just the
[11:44] message of Christ the mystery but the
[11:46] whole message that the Prophet brought
[11:49] is driving to the one point that's why I
[11:52] asked you to to read or to listen to the
[11:57] unveiling of God and then to listen to
[12:00] the mighty God unveiled because both of
[12:03] those messages are wonderful situations
[12:06] as to explaining God in his ways and
[12:11] what he was and how he's not three and
[12:14] how he's this way he's that way but each
[12:16] one of those comes right down to the
[12:19] bride and we got a little bit to go on
[12:22] after we get through with a couple of
[12:24] messages that will back up to that and
[12:27] pick up that seed as it comes down to
[12:29] see how that everything works
[12:32] and comes forth but seeing are you
[12:35] following me so Paul said we have the
[12:40] mind of Christ now what is the mind of
[12:47] Christ
[12:51] using that background policy and I want
[12:54] you to see it go see what is the mind of
[12:57] Christ the mind of Christ is the baptism
[13:01] of the Holy Ghost dwelling in the
[13:04] individual making that individual a part
[13:09] of God's complete plan in Revelation
[13:13] alright there's your mind
[13:16] not your head not your thoughts not your
[13:19] your ideas it floats through your brain
[13:21] the mind the mind that was in Christ is
[13:24] the baptism of the Holy Ghost its
[13:27] dwelling in your soul it's not just in
[13:29] your brain into it that's wonderful for
[13:31] all that we've got there you know of the
[13:34] parts of the mechanical and and and I
[13:37] thank God every day for the message that
[13:39] has been given unto us that we've had
[13:42] the opportunity for 50 years now to
[13:45] study one message you know the entire
[13:49] Bible then talking the history of the
[13:51] Prophet not just one book or one thought
[13:54] but the whole thing comes out and when
[13:57] it does it just keeps molding and
[13:59] molding to me as it just keeps rolling
[14:02] in Word or ever how you would say it
[14:04] until the whole point is if we have the
[14:10] mind of Christ we're gonna salt spring
[14:16] get the point now listen I know that the
[14:19] engrafting and what that means to the
[14:20] Gentiles and what that is the new birth
[14:23] but see really to think about it to come
[14:26] to the last part of your thinking you're
[14:30] part of the mystery and if you are part
[14:34] of the mystery then you're gonna have to
[14:36] be revealed all right now what is
[14:40] revealed you know we talked about
[14:43] revealed and we say well revealed is
[14:46] God he's not too far and he's the father
[14:49] he's the son he's the Holy Ghost and all
[14:51] these things all that is well and good
[14:53] because that's thinking about the
[14:55] revelation but really what is the
[14:58] revelation of God you say the mind of
[15:01] Christ is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[15:04] and we believe that what see then if the
[15:08] mind of Christ be the baptism of the
[15:09] Holy go see words the revealing coming
[15:13] forth it's revealing you as part of
[15:18] God's plan think about that back even
[15:25] before the foundation of the world
[15:26] he had in his mind what he was going to
[15:29] do according to Christ the mystery he
[15:32] had it all in and laid out in his mind
[15:34] what he was going to do well then come
[15:37] to find out as it's going he he starts
[15:41] out like in Christ the mystery
[15:42] explaining one God that's why I want you
[15:46] to read some of these messages like the
[15:48] unveiling of God he starts out
[15:49] explaining one God yeah
[15:51] but then he gets to the bride as being
[15:54] part of that God that has been revealed
[15:59] the all of your messages if you'll get
[16:02] them in a way take Christ the mystery he
[16:04] starts off as a plan and a purpose to
[16:06] unveil himself right but in a little bit
[16:12] he is speaking of a church or a bride or
[16:15] a group of people that's him made
[16:21] manifest and part of the mystery and got
[16:26] to be revealed so if there's something
[16:28] about God to be revealed you know and I
[16:31] still believe that when we get out of
[16:33] this world it'll still be opening to us
[16:35] I've always believed that I don't think
[16:37] you'd I don't think the only end the
[16:39] word even when you get out of this world
[16:41] it's just beginning it would be just be
[16:44] the beginning point cause we'll have
[16:45] enough understanding well what about
[16:47] when you come to that point and he
[16:50] strokes back at you and he says we said
[16:53] you were part of my mystery
[17:00] you were part of my mystery because
[17:02] you're part of me that's what makes him
[17:05] part of me that's what makes him to have
[17:07] to be revealed then then you say well
[17:11] now now the revealing of Jesus and God
[17:14] is like it reveals the Godhead it
[17:16] revealed to this and idea okay it
[17:18] reveals the Godhead see then the Godhead
[17:23] is not complete without you so now
[17:27] you're still right back to the mystery
[17:31] it's the point of what I'm trying to say
[17:34] it's a point of of revealing not
[17:38] yourself he never came to reveal himself
[17:44] he came to reveal the father or to make
[17:47] that God know make the father known see
[17:51] all right and see that's what he's doing
[17:53] to me and you he's waiting on the church
[17:56] to realize who she is and what she's
[17:59] doing here and then he can move on the
[18:02] scene into that alright the Prophet said
[18:06] I have to back up you remember that he
[18:10] said now I can't go any further said
[18:12] I'll have to back up until this catches
[18:14] up over here alright
[18:17] now I'm serious about that I think this
[18:21] is out here is catching up you know I
[18:24] think the world is catching up
[18:27] I think it's caught up to the point that
[18:30] I don't see what it can be I mean in a
[18:33] snap of a pen or whatever they could
[18:38] just change anything and just make
[18:41] anything as a law and and degrees in
[18:44] things you know you know and and you
[18:47] know as Terence of the day and listening
[18:50] one of the doctors was talking about it
[18:52] and he had a good point he said they say
[18:55] well this has been proven to help and
[19:00] this has been proven to help he said
[19:03] give me both of them I mean that's what
[19:07] that's what you said he said just give
[19:09] me both of them because hey I'm in bad
[19:12] shape like anything
[19:13] I mean we're dying if people are just
[19:18] passing away well I try something yeah
[19:21] but that they see anything hey come on
[19:23] we are the any pigs we've been up the
[19:25] whole time but a dead guinea pig I'm
[19:29] gonna help nothing well if you can give
[19:33] him something give it to him no you said
[19:37] well that's brutal why is it brutal
[19:41] whatever you can do to try to help
[19:43] mankind you do what you can do I'm just
[19:47] saying that point to to get you to think
[19:49] about what the Prophet said with this
[19:51] over here catches up
[19:53] he said I'm dropping back until it's
[19:56] over here well I believe he was talking
[19:58] about the world and the systems and the
[20:00] thing and I think it's pretty well
[20:01] caught up right now
[20:03] because I've been here for 50 years in
[20:06] this message and from that to now I've
[20:09] been trying to figure out how in the
[20:10] world can this thing happen you know I'm
[20:17] just serious that's I've always been
[20:18] into that thinking how can this thing
[20:21] happen how can they just and it's done
[20:25] well we know now how it's done you said
[20:30] well I said it's because of this this
[20:32] disease over there no there was more
[20:37] lost in that swine flu back there than
[20:39] where they are right now they're getting
[20:41] up close because there's like a half a
[20:42] million or something died back in there
[20:46] or have any million or something yeah
[20:49] and now see it's it's catching up all
[20:51] right let's see if those thing if that's
[20:54] what the Prophet is looking at then
[20:56] we're looking at the end and that's what
[21:00] I want you to do is to look at
[21:03] everything as a positive complete point
[21:06] of view that it's here now you know what
[21:10] I you're spearing us Hey I didn't scare
[21:14] you by putting out and sending you home
[21:16] from work and telling you could go home
[21:18] and get paid and all these things and
[21:21] and people are worried to death think
[21:24] about what all this situation is I
[21:26] didn't start
[21:27] I'm telling you the Bible part of it the
[21:33] Bible tells us to be perlis time to be
[21:35] all kind of things happening well here
[21:37] we are all right we don't throw up her
[21:41] hands and quit no because this is the
[21:46] part that was meant to be mine but you
[21:50] say well well then you need to preach to
[21:53] us and tell us about this here tell us
[21:55] about that there and what's over here
[21:57] so what you know so what it's coming
[22:04] that's the best way for me to say it I'm
[22:07] trying to get me and you to see who we
[22:09] are and then you have no fear of what
[22:12] they are saying or trying to do your
[22:17] fear goes away because you realize that
[22:19] hey I'm a part of God I'm not concerned
[22:23] with what the world is doing I hate it
[22:26] because of the worldís situation I hate
[22:29] for those you know hundreds of thousands
[22:31] of people dying you know and all that
[22:34] that's bad I mean that's a bad point and
[22:38] you know but I like what Wade was saying
[22:40] about it the other day and his message
[22:42] there the plagues and things come upon
[22:46] us because we're turning down God's Word
[22:50] right
[22:51] I mean it comes because we turned down
[22:54] God's Word well eating it odd that all
[22:57] at once it fell through Luke or two or
[23:03] three months after all of this started
[23:06] saying the Prophet was wrong and in
[23:09] doing this that in the other than going
[23:10] on and changing it from this part to
[23:12] that part and saying he missed it it's
[23:14] the way and then all at once here comes
[23:16] the plague
[23:18] well I don't think that's accidental now
[23:20] I don't I'm serious I'm not trying to
[23:23] make no doomsday part out of it I'm
[23:25] trying to make the truth out of it to
[23:28] where that we look at the truth of it
[23:30] and say okay well what is the other
[23:34] thing see
[23:38] by Boyle as we was reading out the other
[23:40] day and trying to bring what when the
[23:42] enemy comes in like a flood what we've
[23:44] got the promises we don't have to worry
[23:46] about it we're not promised that
[23:50] sickness won't come upon us but we're
[23:52] promised that we have the promise within
[23:55] us and the Holy Ghost within us that we
[23:57] can ask our Father to take care of these
[23:59] things and he'll do it all right we have
[24:02] that we have the right to pray is enough
[24:05] said that's the that might not mean unto
[24:08] you but it is well if they could take
[24:10] away right to pray we'd be in bad shape
[24:13] yeah but we still have that right to
[24:16] pray and to call upon our Father and
[24:18] he'll come on the scene to do because
[24:21] that's what he's doing he's here now to
[24:23] make not now listen listen to the
[24:27] wording and get it right he's not coming
[24:29] to make himself known that's been down
[24:34] through time in the Old Testament it
[24:40] came to a point of ending the Old
[24:42] Testament what with revealing God right
[24:48] but you know it's hard isn't it that
[24:51] that God walked out in human flesh right
[24:57] the god that was being revealed what was
[25:00] being revealed reveal is to make known
[25:02] our to make manifest it's not that this
[25:08] man that's what I'm trying to get us not
[25:10] to see you know to look at it and think
[25:12] that we're part of the mystery well well
[25:15] we got this over here to be real now now
[25:16] just just find out who you are see who
[25:23] you are and what you're here for
[25:27] well then you can go all the way back
[25:29] into the message see I can stand here
[25:31] now and my mind just runs back 30 40 50
[25:34] years in trying to get us to see who we
[25:40] are and what we're here for this is not
[25:46] a new thing to me this is 50 years old I
[25:50] mean we've got to tell you
[25:52] and things back there firm back on what
[25:55] about mm and somewhere right around 2000
[25:57] that we've got from there up to where we
[26:00] are now so if you don't think that I'm
[26:02] telling the truth about it you can go
[26:03] back there and listen
[26:05] we had the others and we wound up being
[26:07] submitted to we had to get rid of them
[26:10] you know and but think about it what do
[26:16] you think now I'm asking you a point
[26:18] where you will get the connection why do
[26:20] you think the prophet was saying when he
[26:23] was saying the bride is part of the
[26:25] mystery you know I mean what do you
[26:33] think about that well I think that I
[26:36] think you're making too much out of us
[26:40] let's see that ain't what I'm looking at
[26:43] I am looking at your flesh and your
[26:47] being or what you are
[26:49] I've never looked that away
[26:51] I've always looked ice that then no
[26:55] matter what people don't I've been
[26:56] through horrible situations with
[26:58] ministers and things that you know
[27:00] ridiculed and done and all kind of thing
[27:02] but I never looked at that person with
[27:05] any hatred whatsoever I never got up and
[27:09] lambasted them from the pulpit and you
[27:11] know instead of a bunch of things and
[27:13] old look at them they've done this that
[27:15] they're so that means guarded or no no
[27:17] no
[27:19] cause see that ain't what am i I'm
[27:21] interested in I don't call that
[27:25] preaching to get up and beat people to
[27:28] death with the gospel I don't call that
[27:30] preaching well the Lord told me to
[27:34] preach is like okay I'm not second
[27:37] nothing that's fine preach it but make
[27:41] sure that he told you what to preach cuz
[27:48] I remember one brother in the message
[27:50] you know and he'd always made a
[27:51] statement and he'd say yeah brother
[27:53] branham told me what to preach well
[27:58] everybody just flocked to him he wound
[28:00] up being one of those seven guys it was
[28:02] supposed to have been the seven thunders
[28:04] back years ago you know okay but anyhow
[28:09] he he's doing so you know I'm like this
[28:12] huh I'm kind of interested in finding
[28:14] out what the story all of it is so I
[28:17] just asked him one day I said what is it
[28:23] that you know that you were told to
[28:27] preach he said hail firing it hot well
[28:34] that's what he told me to preach he told
[28:38] every preacher that he calls he's
[28:39] aprietale firing it hot but not the
[28:42] wrong way for it being Hellfire hot see
[28:46] that's part of the doing but I found out
[28:49] from that that see people were afraid of
[28:52] him because they thought he had some
[28:56] kind of something that the Prophet had
[28:58] told him and in an ordained demon you
[29:00] knowing things and all of that but see
[29:05] I'm not interested in there I'm
[29:09] interested in finding out who I am well
[29:13] what do you mean are you I'm Samuel day
[29:16] uh-huh
[29:16] I Know Who I am
[29:19] do you know who you was before the
[29:21] foundation of the world but remember the
[29:27] real you is the one that was back tyre
[29:30] then you say well I'm not too real me
[29:32] now you're the real you but you just you
[29:34] just got the wrong impersonation you
[29:36] you're thinking about trying to make
[29:38] known that fella that you livin in that
[29:40] body when that ain't what I'm talking
[29:43] about and they what God's talking about
[29:45] it's making known the Word of God
[29:52] bringing the Word of God out into the
[29:54] open to work that you can see what God
[29:57] has been doing all these years
[29:59] and following it down like I said 50
[30:02] years I've been watching this and seeing
[30:08] things and said Lord no what's it gonna
[30:14] be and see if we've always been been
[30:19] able to have basic answers to questions
[30:25] when people would come along you know
[30:26] what do you think about this what do you
[30:28] think about that it's always been that
[30:31] God gave us some answers to those things
[30:33] that people were questioning all right
[30:36] and my question or my answer to any
[30:40] question is what like you say what is
[30:42] the mind of Christ okay we've got that
[30:44] in simplified form right do we say the
[30:48] mind or crowd one well we didn't know
[30:49] with the money
[30:50] no what is the mind of Christ what does
[30:52] the Prophet say about it the mind of
[30:55] Christ is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[30:57] not your natural mind but the mind that
[31:05] was in Christ being you will make you a
[31:08] new creature new creation all right so
[31:11] now we know that all right and we know
[31:15] then that what we're doing is we're not
[31:18] trying to build up some kind of a
[31:19] something that hey we've got an image
[31:21] over here and we're trying to make that
[31:23] image now now we are that that's the
[31:28] whole point
[31:29] we're that that's being revealed
[31:34] see then brother Brennan says I lost my
[31:39] mind
[31:42] and now I've received the mind of Christ
[31:50] he said lost my mind he said if you have
[31:55] the mind of Christ and you're a new
[31:57] creation but he says what we need to do
[32:02] is lose our mind quit thinking about
[32:05] this brain quit thinking about those
[32:08] type of things
[32:09] get into thinking about the real thing
[32:12] that's being made known then you can see
[32:15] that your everyday you're being revealed
[32:18] you realize that God is living in you
[32:21] into you know walking into faith it's
[32:25] like he was before and the Prophet said
[32:28] the only difference is the corporal body
[32:34] right see his corporal body was virgin
[32:38] born and talking like that ours wasn't
[32:40] before the rest of it he turned of life
[32:44] if you have eternal life today then
[32:51] that's what we're supposed to be doing
[32:52] to let the world know who we are and
[32:56] what we're here for see if somebody
[32:58] couldn't ask you sir what do you think
[33:00] about this you've been in this message
[33:01] wondering what do you think of well I
[33:03] think it's supposed to do and I don't
[33:05] mean the wrong now I think it's supposed
[33:07] to be this I think it's supposed to be
[33:08] that
[33:11] but what do you hear that message is the
[33:17] revealing of Jesus Christ in you that's
[33:22] what we need to hear that's what brings
[33:24] hope to our soul and being is to realize
[33:28] that just us being born-again Christians
[33:33] is fulfilling God's Word and making
[33:40] known see the only way you can preach
[33:42] the gospel you have to preach what's
[33:44] within you right Minister brother said
[33:47] you have to preach watch within you
[33:49] because there's not you're saying what
[33:51] somebody else says and that won't do no
[33:53] good
[33:54] it's what's something within you that is
[33:56] where the point comes in God told me to
[33:59] preach this and I appreciate that that
[34:01] brings it to the right point because
[34:05] that's what he's doing he's coming he's
[34:08] using you now to think about it we found
[34:20] a great mysterious point in our thoughts
[34:23] as we come down through the Hebrews
[34:26] 11:40 series part that we spin in the
[34:32] one was one where brother Branham says
[34:34] lean not to your own understanding
[34:36] number five they want to pull it up that
[34:41] God is not complete without us now
[34:48] that's something they may not mean
[34:51] anything to you but it certainly means
[34:53] something to me to think that I'm part
[34:58] of what he had before the world and see
[35:02] one of these days we're gonna get on
[35:03] predestination cuz see if you go back in
[35:07] predestination and you stop in
[35:09] foreknowledge that's a wonderful place
[35:12] that's wonderful that's a good place to
[35:14] stop in foreknowledge and think it over
[35:17] but just remember God was a whole lot
[35:21] further than foreknowledge
[35:25] because his foreknowledge was that you
[35:28] was going to be him
[35:31] made manifest in this world that's not
[35:37] just for knowledge that's saying what it
[35:44] is the mystery listen see God is not
[35:49] complete without us alright and see we
[35:55] saw another great point of understanding
[35:57] one what we've been talking on for a
[36:01] little bit
[36:01] the brother branham in the cross the
[36:03] mystery of God revealed since he's part
[36:06] of the mystery she is part of the
[36:11] mystery now he's not complete without
[36:14] you now we covered our the last area
[36:17] life Sunday were spoken word a regional
[36:20] seat and it's I gave you a couple of
[36:23] others word was talking about that you
[36:27] know God wants to make himself known
[36:33] yeah but he wants to do it through me
[36:37] and you he's using this illustration
[36:43] he's using we use the sisters because
[36:46] they are they they you know ain't much
[36:50] difference much old man looking out at
[36:51] her but you know you you're going down
[36:54] to a store with your wife and
[36:56] everybody's looking at her and not lust
[36:59] in at that point but they're looking at
[37:01] her and her dress and clothes and things
[37:04] like that you know and you're walking
[37:06] with your mom you're walking along you
[37:08] know and they're Lynn see they're
[37:10] looking at that and they're saying they
[37:12] something different
[37:15] we'll see that's what I'm talking about
[37:17] that that's what's being revealed God is
[37:21] being revealed in you because whatever
[37:25] he would be doing now he would always
[37:30] have to be doing that so he's trying to
[37:33] make no and the sisters walk alone to
[37:36] see the higher they see the clothes the
[37:37] dress the actions and reactions and the
[37:40] things you know and if they do they say
[37:43] well there's something different about
[37:45] that person well there is something has
[37:50] happened on the inside see that's do it
[37:52] and then the outside its what's
[37:54] displaying the mystery the mystery is
[37:57] that you've realized and listen the
[38:00] mystery is that you realized who you are
[38:03] not if you quit wearing clothes of wrong
[38:06] type of clothes or or quit cutting you
[38:08] hire anything that's great that's
[38:10] wonderful but that's just that can be Oh
[38:12] an act of works and have nothing to do
[38:18] with Christianity who's that Crystal
[38:20] Gayle or whatever her name is that has
[38:22] her that just drags the ground along
[38:26] behind her and all I'm not saying she's
[38:28] not a Christian that's nothing to me I'm
[38:30] just making the point does it make you a
[38:33] Christian because of the hiring of
[38:35] clothes and things like that no it's as
[38:42] you have something that they don't have
[38:51] I don't made a statement the other day
[38:53] you know and I never did finish it up in
[38:55] Vegas it man you goofed on that one well
[38:57] I was trying to explain the back fact of
[39:01] being a Christian and we're supposed to
[39:04] be a Christian no matter where we're at
[39:07] you know 24 hours a day 7 days a week
[39:11] driving and running doing drive the
[39:13] trucks all dingy we're supposed to be
[39:15] doing that and I made that statement I
[39:16] said it wouldn't matter to me she put
[39:18] Merlin Monroe on an island with just you
[39:21] alone what was I saying I was just
[39:23] saying that both Lynne
[39:27] you know what you wouldn't be running
[39:29] around lusting after her then you
[39:35] wouldn't be doing those thing you
[39:37] wouldn't be having problems with it that
[39:39] was the point of running it if you're
[39:41] true Christian if you're true Christmas
[39:46] sure you could look at her and see and
[39:48] know all the things but yet you look
[39:50] back and see if if I could get to her
[39:54] what I've got in me that come into my
[39:57] life and changed me it'll change her
[40:03] that's what I thought Christianity was
[40:06] supposed to be and see our sisters
[40:11] wouldn't even think about it but every
[40:13] day they're displaying Jesus Christ
[40:15] through their lives and things and
[40:18] that's making known God because God is
[40:23] in them now to the point of saying that
[40:29] that you know always no no no no this
[40:32] I've always said it the prostitutes in
[40:34] my day had long hair and long dresses
[40:37] that didn't make the that wouldn't
[40:40] appoint you know he you know it was back
[40:44] there because there was not I don't know
[40:47] how you'd say that was just part of the
[40:49] day in the hour they were living but
[40:52] listen I thought that what Jesus Christ
[40:58] come to do was to make God known is that
[41:07] not the point
[41:08] see he come to make God known all right
[41:13] now and making God known God made him
[41:16] known and I've always said that about
[41:20] the people if you just listen and think
[41:22] what statement is always made if you
[41:25] make God known he'll make you know you
[41:33] just walk in the word of the hour that
[41:35] you've got and try to study that
[41:38] and just be what you're supposed to be
[41:40] we're supposed to be Christians it's not
[41:44] something of trying to reveal because
[41:46] that's the point of what I'm trying to
[41:48] drive to bring down see Jesus when he
[41:50] came he came to make the father known he
[41:54] brought him out in the open that he
[41:56] could be seen then he wasn't concerned
[42:01] about being seen he was concerned about
[42:04] making his father known well why
[42:08] wouldn't it be the same for you and me
[42:11] why would it not be that that this
[42:14] message is not a book of rules as
[42:16] message is not always like this message
[42:18] is a revelation of Jesus Christ
[42:19] personally to you now I hope this keeps
[42:27] adding on to the point of what I'm
[42:29] talking about if it's so close to you
[42:32] that it's within you then he's in you
[42:35] trying to make yourself known again he's
[42:39] trying to make us known God is trying
[42:48] his best to make his children known to
[42:50] the world that's why we don't do is the
[42:58] world we don't run as the world we don't
[43:00] go out of all of the things we do what
[43:02] we do we don't I know in making the
[43:07] decision to where we would run the
[43:09] church the way we're running it now
[43:11] see naturally within my mind becomes
[43:14] thoughts of what other people will think
[43:18] then there was a guy wrote a paper in
[43:21] Gainesville the other day and he said
[43:24] what are we doing he said are we
[43:31] teaching our children that God is not
[43:33] real or you know to do so we're closing
[43:37] their doors
[43:38] well they had a good point you know I
[43:42] mean he had a good point that was the
[43:43] way with state it was a good point
[43:45] but the thing of it is you can't operate
[43:48] under a good point
[43:51] you can say well we ordered just to come
[43:54] to church and we'll get this brother
[43:55] Dale I'm I'm I'm just upset with you
[43:59] because you didn't just say we're going
[44:01] to how churches we're gonna do and all I
[44:02] have
[44:03] well what if you do that and pie some
[44:08] diseases among you then what you don't
[44:11] say that's all I was doing was just
[44:17] complying to the government but now when
[44:21] they start meddling with us and our
[44:24] teachings and our thoughts and our thing
[44:26] then is time then to reveal there's not
[44:31] time to reveal now now is the time to
[44:33] just sit back and wait and see what's
[44:34] going on it's for that role so we're
[44:38] learning what they're doing they're
[44:43] setting up things right now that could
[44:45] be used at any split second and in doing
[44:54] that then we have to be prepared we'll
[44:56] God will take care of it you mean God is
[45:00] going if you know you mean God is
[45:02] wanting to make his children known and
[45:04] then he's going where's he gonna put him
[45:07] right in the midst of the battle right
[45:13] he's going to put his church right in
[45:16] the midst of the battle we're not gonna
[45:19] get a bypass of all things and no
[45:21] troubles and heartaches and things we're
[45:26] not promised that we're promised that
[45:29] there's many afflictions but I like to
[45:31] rest that's true but the Lord lead us
[45:33] out of them all see we have that we have
[45:36] the word that we can call upon our
[45:38] Father in the word to show him that he
[45:41] said these things and believe it what
[45:44] you think he's wanting to do that in it
[45:45] you think he's wanting to kill us off
[45:47] anyway no but he's wanting us to stand
[45:52] up now and just be people or what we're
[45:55] supposed to be help everybody you can do
[45:59] what you can
[46:00] why because that's the Christian
[46:02] attitude okay listen
[46:05] but I want you to just think on this now
[46:09] the bride is part of the mystery and God
[46:18] is now revealing then there's like a
[46:23] quote another night where the Prophet
[46:24] was saying her the other day like you
[46:26] know he said that what is he talking
[46:29] about the well I think up in a minute
[46:34] convenient he's trying to get us to see
[46:39] who we are and what we're doing here and
[46:44] what the prophets say he says when the
[46:46] bride does that realized who she is what
[46:48] should you what did he say he said
[46:51] she'll be an invincible army alright
[46:53] then that's all I'm trying to get us to
[46:57] say that's what I'm that's my purpose is
[46:59] to get us to see who we are and what
[47:03] we're here for
[47:04] we're not here to fight and you know all
[47:07] kind of we're here to be Christians and
[47:14] just to walk in the light of the Lord
[47:17] and listen if the bride now listen to
[47:20] the point now for just a minute on this
[47:22] if the bride is part of the mystery and
[47:25] she must be revealed then now you can
[47:29] see why brother Branham so emphatically
[47:31] states that all God was he poured into
[47:40] Christ all Christ he pours into the
[47:47] church so whatever was there in him
[47:54] being made manifest as he was walking
[47:57] the earth and doing is our example of
[48:01] what a true Christians supposed to be
[48:03] right was the way that Jesus was himself
[48:06] all right then in that then all God was
[48:11] that was what it was there he was in
[48:14] Christ
[48:17] I don't know I was looking this probably
[48:19] 3040 or maybe more than that times that
[48:22] wrote around and we use that very
[48:23] statement all God was he put in the
[48:25] cross all Christ in the church take her
[48:28] back to the Garden of Eden the the
[48:32] threefold purpose all right now if he's
[48:38] not complete without us how could he be
[48:42] the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[48:46] are you listening see without us he's
[48:50] not the fullness you say wait a minute
[48:52] you're DB little in God
[48:54] no I'm saying what's your profit that's
[48:56] saying you think what you want to buy
[48:59] what I'm being in I'm not doing I'm
[49:00] building up God because remember one
[49:03] thing for sure he brought us here we're
[49:08] here to make our father manifest we're
[49:11] not here to make ourselves manifest
[49:14] we're here to make our father manifest
[49:17] and made known and doing it we look back
[49:21] and see that even the prophets message
[49:23] the whole message is a constant I don't
[49:27] mean the word bombardment of it of wrong
[49:30] time but it's a constant in every
[49:32] message that you'll see that he's
[49:35] speaking about what it is to be a
[49:38] Christian and how to be a Christian and
[49:46] what a Christian is supposed to be like
[49:51] we're here now to make our Father known
[49:57] because that's what Jesus was doing he
[50:01] made his father know
[50:02] so all God was he's the fullness of the
[50:07] Godhead bodily why did he pour that over
[50:12] into a church did he leave himself Oh as
[50:15] nothing no way he
[50:22] hen star magnified that's what I've
[50:25] always tried to get people to see that
[50:27] you know that when God passes out when
[50:29] the Holy Ghost goes out then it's not
[50:31] God running out in one of these days
[50:33] he's gonna run out of Holy Ghost angle
[50:34] how no Holy Ghost left to give away I've
[50:36] never believed nothing like that
[50:41] the more he gives away the more it
[50:43] increases the more members of the body
[50:48] of Christ that comes into being into it
[50:51] is more of him being made known and
[50:53] revealed not revealing me and you see
[51:00] that's where it's wrong you think that
[51:02] it's doing it because you look in the
[51:03] Bible like way we talked about the other
[51:05] day listen who was it when the one that
[51:12] went out in the field you know and the
[51:16] servant went after it who was it oh my
[51:19] goodness didn't mean to bring these out
[51:21] but I was thinking about she she comes
[51:24] out in the field and she sees him and
[51:25] she says is that Ellie's our honor
[51:29] it is that Isaac she had been told so
[51:35] much about him she knew exactly what he
[51:37] looked like but she never seen him but
[51:44] she knew what he looked like she didn't
[51:46] have any problem jumping off the camel
[51:48] taking off the wording because she knew
[51:53] who it was
[51:54] that's what God is trying to get me in
[51:56] you to see sure is to see who he is
[52:00] amen was to see who we are you've always
[52:05] heard me make the statement about it if
[52:07] David could whoop a line a giant and a
[52:10] bar and think without the baptism with
[52:13] over the ghost what if he had the new
[52:14] birth man he would he would have took on
[52:18] the whole nation by himself and wouldn't
[52:20] occur it he said bring wrong you know
[52:22] because that he would do but he was that
[52:26] because he knew he had been ordained or
[52:29] anointed way bringing this out you
[52:31] remembered the message ordained to be a
[52:33] proper King and if he was long if he was
[52:37] that until he reached that throne
[52:39] he's not to work he's out to be
[52:42] concerned now once he reached the throne
[52:45] what different situation it because he
[52:48] become capable of being the key old
[52:50] enough but he couldn't have been killed
[52:52] for then and see that's that anointing
[52:56] and that anointing came on Jesus on the
[52:59] river Jordan there to start his ministry
[53:01] he couldn't be killed during that
[53:02] without anointing on him
[53:07] but now when anointing left him in the
[53:10] garden well see you know how I've always
[53:14] thought that that anointing left him to
[53:17] be able to come upon you and me well if
[53:22] it can come upon me and you then we
[53:24] can't pass no way Satan can do anything
[53:26] with us as long as that anointing is
[53:30] with us and what Saul all of us
[53:37] completed once everything is fully made
[53:39] known and everything in order then we
[53:42] could be clear the point of being able
[53:44] to be killed but you can't be killed now
[53:46] cuz you got your gnawing on you
[53:50] you just think about that he's trying to
[53:53] get you to see who you are see the
[53:59] mystery part of the threefold mystery
[54:05] she's part of the threefold man he's in
[54:08] the three form if she's part of him so
[54:11] now go back to what I was saying then
[54:13] all God was he poured into Christ all
[54:19] Christ into the church the fullness do
[54:27] you think I was being received when I've
[54:31] tried my best learned in 1969 and Athens
[54:34] Georgia to explain about that the bride
[54:36] of Jesus Christ would be the son of man
[54:41] but you see the Prophet was saying that
[54:43] was what I was trying to get the people
[54:45] to see the son of man brother Branham is
[54:48] not the son of man he's a son of man
[54:51] he's in the body of Christ making him
[54:55] part of the body of Christ making him
[54:58] part of the fullness of the Godhead
[54:59] bodily yes
[55:05] but the bride has to be the fullness
[55:10] something's got a Halpin Church it came
[55:12] to just wind up with with being this
[55:14] anything something's got to happen let's
[55:17] get a couple of these right here and
[55:18] then we'll quit go ahead to number 12
[55:35] let's just jump over to that number 12
[55:41] while they're getting there it's from
[55:42] Chrysler mr. God revealed he said he has
[55:44] showed and revealed an ever top that is
[55:46] in the Bible
[55:47] therefore the entire Bible is the
[55:49] revelation of God's mystery in Christ
[55:52] hmm the entire Bible is an expression of
[55:57] one goal that God had one purpose he
[56:00] wanted to achieve in the entire Bible
[56:03] now listen and all the acts of the
[56:08] believers in the Bible has been in top
[56:12] and expressing what God's great goal is
[56:16] and now in the last days he has revealed
[56:19] it and showed it and God's help will see
[56:23] it right here this morning what but
[56:28] she's part of the mystery they'll get
[56:31] that and then we'll go to the other so
[56:33] follow me what I'm saying
[56:36] then grafting of the Gentiles is
[56:38] wonderful because that is part of the
[56:41] mystery but there's something there
[56:45] that's more mysterious than just the
[56:48] Gentiles being grafted in it's the
[56:54] mystery of the bride and Christ being
[56:56] one it's you becoming one with your
[57:02] father
[57:05] you've become at one with him now if
[57:11] that be true then look what he says
[57:17] don't serve as we would see Jesus Jesus
[57:20] was God in flesh and if Jesus is in you
[57:24] tonight
[57:28] now listen if Jesus is in you tonight
[57:35] it's still God manifests himself in the
[57:41] last days in other words here we are
[57:45] part of the mystery Son of Man revealing
[57:48] himself in his church in his church
[57:55] right part of the mystery and it's
[57:59] promised to us Jesus Christ is the same
[58:06] yesterday today and forever and he's
[58:08] identifying himself as he promised much
[58:12] more could we say in these last days as
[58:15] son of man making himself known among
[58:20] his people in the form of his people now
[58:26] I read that for well you know where I'll
[58:28] be going on the next called we'll go
[58:30] through the word in Morphy
[58:31] next services you know changing this
[58:33] form and think of where you can see it's
[58:35] in us I would look making himself known
[58:40] among his people in the form of his
[58:43] people the not Son of God me not son of
[58:50] David was Son of Man the Son of man was
[58:53] the supernatural so we're living in the
[58:57] supernatural ok fullness of the Godhead
[59:01] bodily in his sons and daughters ok
[59:06] let's get the lights 4:16
[59:09] no leaven among you that brings the
[59:14] entire fullness of the Godhead bodily
[59:17] among you now no leaven let me take that
[59:22] dish for a minute no leaven among you no
[59:31] ideas or thoughts are contrary doctrines
[59:39] no leaven called living when you add to
[59:42] live in you know it makes rising us you
[59:44] don't do that in the communion bread you
[59:46] make it it doesn't have any bread in
[59:48] eleven in inter ends I see because
[59:51] that's that's Westmead all right no
[59:54] leaven in other words when it comes to a
[59:57] time finally that the bride of Jesus
[1:00:01] Christ will get rid of all of her ideas
[1:00:03] and thoughts and wonders about what's
[1:00:05] going on and settle down and just be
[1:00:08] what he told us we are and take that and
[1:00:11] do it see there's your leaven is your
[1:00:14] ideas or your thoughts or your something
[1:00:17] that you've come up with well I think
[1:00:19] it's this way I think I don't have no
[1:00:21] rights to think what it is no leaven
[1:00:27] among you the brings the fullness of the
[1:00:29] Godhead bodily
[1:00:31] yeah listen see what is this one on the
[1:00:35] mighty guard unveiled I didn't give him
[1:00:39] this one okay so don't lose then it was
[1:00:41] God in them days it was God in a man his
[1:00:45] son Jesus Christ we believe that not
[1:00:49] just a prophet not just an ordinary man
[1:00:52] ordinary human it was God in Christ God
[1:00:56] in a man the fullness of the Godhead
[1:01:00] bodily in a man God in a man now it's
[1:01:05] God in men the fullness of God in the
[1:01:12] Godhead bodily in his entire Church
[1:01:16] manifesting our making known the himself
[1:01:21] fulfilling the word
[1:01:25] why can't we believe that why can't we
[1:01:30] believe that we are the body of Jesus
[1:01:36] Christ and the body follows ahead if you
[1:01:40] read boards reading them seat over and
[1:01:43] over your body always follows the head
[1:01:45] and see in doing that then we'll come
[1:01:49] out to realize who we are I hope this
[1:01:53] don't become boring to the church in any
[1:01:55] point of thinking about it of me trying
[1:01:58] to express something over and over but I
[1:02:01] want you to see what you are I want you
[1:02:05] to see what you are the brother Gary
[1:02:12] Atkins he said said I see here now that
[1:02:18] my point he said I can see because God
[1:02:21] is is revealed in in Jesus Christ I said
[1:02:25] that's great
[1:02:27] pressing the brain to yourself when God
[1:02:33] is revealed in you now you're getting
[1:02:36] down to heaven understand it what is the
[1:02:40] new birth then it's revelation of Jesus
[1:02:46] Christ personally to you of what you are
[1:02:53] he's making known to you who you are
[1:02:55] you're part of him and being part of him
[1:03:00] then he's not complete without us no
[1:03:03] he'll never leave us because he's United
[1:03:09] with us in the point to bring us his own
[1:03:12] life when we realize what we're doing
[1:03:16] here about that anything I've tried my
[1:03:22] best to to preach to the ministers of
[1:03:24] the message and the things you know is
[1:03:26] what a little bit I could try to get
[1:03:28] them to see that it's not arguing over
[1:03:31] this or that or other and that's never
[1:03:36] been nothing
[1:03:37] and then you know you know it's finding
[1:03:41] out who you are really say you mean that
[1:03:48] bobble is me no no my Bible says Joe
[1:03:53] we'll see you know how the Prophet says
[1:03:56] take and put your name and say by His
[1:04:00] stripes I Samuel dalem heal well now I
[1:04:03] could read over here and buy your stock
[1:04:05] Paul is healed but that's no good
[1:04:09] then won't heal me that heal Paul they
[1:04:14] didn't heal heal me but when it comes to
[1:04:16] me reading and putting my name there and
[1:04:20] see that all of these things is in the
[1:04:23] battle that's been going on it's not a
[1:04:32] battle of human wits it's a battle of
[1:04:38] realizing realization something happens
[1:04:42] it just clicks and you say you mean
[1:04:46] that's what it is
[1:04:48] yes that's what it is that's what he's
[1:04:55] been trying to get us to see the whole
[1:04:56] time who we are no no brother Dale he's
[1:05:00] been trying to get us to see who he is
[1:05:01] that should have been settled a long
[1:05:03] time ago now that should have been
[1:05:07] settled a long time ago when we come
[1:05:09] into the message and the prophet begin
[1:05:11] to explain one God and brought it into
[1:05:13] being in the points and thought man I
[1:05:15] was elated because I had never seen that
[1:05:19] way of God being revealed but then one
[1:05:26] day I see you had dog there was four of
[1:05:31] us in the car and we'd listened to a
[1:05:33] tape we had a battery-powered
[1:05:34] tape recorder Oh Kai I guess budino it
[1:05:39] was a battery-powered we'll see we'd
[1:05:42] take the tapes and we play them going to
[1:05:43] work well it would work good Kahn had
[1:05:46] eight batteries well you know eight
[1:05:47] batteries now years ago if there's a
[1:05:49] dollar piece
[1:05:51] yeah you still with money you know
[1:05:54] because doing it well sometimes we do
[1:05:57] for them didn't get to get the tapes you
[1:06:00] know I mean the the the batteries can
[1:06:02] play the tape I said to her many a time
[1:06:04] from here at adorable and turned that
[1:06:07] tape layer because it would have enough
[1:06:09] power to be able to bring forth the
[1:06:12] voice but it wouldn't have enough power
[1:06:14] to run the mechanical part of the
[1:06:16] machine I've said to her many a day and
[1:06:18] run that thing with a pencil I ain't
[1:06:23] gonna lose nothing like I know you
[1:06:25] weren't interested in the word I was
[1:06:29] interested in the word to hear what that
[1:06:32] prophet said to hear what he was saying
[1:06:40] that's why that I'm so emphatic about it
[1:06:43] like I said I noticed in the last
[1:06:45] message come on musician last message I
[1:06:47] was talking about sure little random as
[1:06:51] a part of this we're not no way in the
[1:06:53] world trying to leave him out of
[1:06:55] anything he was the one that brought the
[1:06:57] message to us well yet he's not the
[1:07:00] message the Lord Jesus is the message
[1:07:04] and see being part of the bride then
[1:07:07] he's part of the mystery okay because
[1:07:11] he's part of the bride and he's part of
[1:07:14] the mystery being revealed amen
[1:07:16] now our part is there we've done 50
[1:07:20] years of doing you know this is like
[1:07:23] they told them in the country overseas
[1:07:26] it hey you've you've come over here and
[1:07:28] told us about the Prophet and the things
[1:07:29] and all that said now tell us what he
[1:07:32] told and I said something to the brother
[1:07:36] about it I said that's that means he you
[1:07:39] know you need to send somebody over
[1:07:41] there that knows the message you know
[1:07:44] and let them teach the message because
[1:07:47] they know the Prophet was a prophet now
[1:07:50] said I'm the message well it stayed with
[1:07:54] the same old story you know that won't
[1:07:57] never work out but listen I hope you'll
[1:08:01] go and think on these things goes next
[1:08:03] what I want to do is here
[1:08:04] these quotes basically we're read around
[1:08:07] talking about the bride being the
[1:08:09] fullness of the Godhead bodily and let
[1:08:12] him sell it tell us these things well if
[1:08:15] she's part of it and we're talking about
[1:08:17] her we're making her known when I read
[1:08:21] the books I'm trying to make brother
[1:08:23] Branham known you know I'm saying
[1:08:25] runaround brought this message Paul
[1:08:27] brought this Peter brought this I'm
[1:08:29] trying to make them known as to what
[1:08:32] they do because that's giving them their
[1:08:34] right place it's making them known well
[1:08:41] then I said wanna go then if we make him
[1:08:43] known you make us know I'm concerned
[1:08:46] about that boy less than what we go
[1:08:49] that's a sing that course Jesus be the
[1:08:52] Lord of all Jesus Jesus be the Lord of
[1:09:12] all the keen arms my heart
[1:09:19] whoa Jesus I surrender all to you Jesus
[1:09:29] I surrender all oh Jesus I surrender the
[1:09:41] kingdom he might have a name just think
[1:09:46] about it Jesus we've spent all of our
[1:09:52] life thinking that God was trying to
[1:09:54] make himself known and that's true but
[1:09:58] we didn't see that he had a mystery in
[1:10:01] his mind he had something in his mind
[1:10:05] that goes back so far us back past all
[1:10:09] mankind and everything go back into his
[1:10:12] mind and then we get into that and see
[1:10:14] that right back there so they said one
[1:10:18] day they'll preach predestination
[1:10:20] because when you get back to the earth
[1:10:22] it's not just for knowledge see we go to
[1:10:30] for knowledge that's wonderful cuz
[1:10:31] that's predestination God predestined a
[1:10:34] prize for knowledge but what does he
[1:10:37] predestinate himself he's waiting on you
[1:10:44] and me to just realize who we are and
[1:10:50] what we're doing here
[1:10:53] you'll take care of the rest of this the
[1:11:00] kingdom father we thank you Lord for
[1:11:05] this day in your love and to us when we
[1:11:07] pray then what we said that people on
[1:11:09] the internet outside and all here and
[1:11:11] that we can all come to a realization of
[1:11:14] realizing one thing Lord that you're
[1:11:16] trying your best to make us known and
[1:11:19] Lord the Prophet is there's one of the
[1:11:21] quotes we had there he said we keep
[1:11:23] turning it down we turned down you
[1:11:26] trying to make yourself known in us
[1:11:28] because it's not us anyway it's you
[1:11:31] living in us but just have your way be
[1:11:35] with us a wheat of natural meal and back
