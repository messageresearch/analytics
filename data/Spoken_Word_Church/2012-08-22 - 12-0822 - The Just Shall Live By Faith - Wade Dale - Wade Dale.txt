TRANSCRIPT
========================================
thank you amen amen all of them not just thinking change order service bad day Open the Eyes of My Heart oh my God Open the Eyes of My Heart or out your power and love oh great I live there the light of your your More Than Love a holy holy holy this middle of the week all right we got him end of the week coming up this is our supercharged day yeah you know what I was thinking yesterday a little bit about about church service you know and I always bigger than most people go to church just because it is Wednesday Sunday but um we shouldn't do that shouldn't be something that's on the calendar that we've got to do should be something we want to get here and get some more fuel and some more fuel too to combat the devil with because faith comes by hearing right one of the brothers that brother Clark's Church sent me a uh text message and and I'm I'm going to start listening to some of his Daniel 70 weeks series that he's doing out there and brother sent me a message from there and said well uh aren't you studying you know can't you study in other words he was making a funny and I said I just take him back I said fight Young by hearing yeah right great comes by hearing we gotta hear just as much as you guys know right right I mean my goodness you know brother Brown even had to hear right he got messages from the from the Lord but he got him you know life comes through the body right the body of Christ is where life comes through it's not uh you can get a sermon for maybe somebody in a Baptist Church but you know what it's uh it's something that you're gonna have to bring over and and God's gonna have to Quicken to Your Heart Right and your life and uh and then we can bring it to the people and then life can come through the body man all right because I believe that's where life does come through and that's the body it's good to be in the house of the Lord just remember this little uh this little kid here uh I know they're going to have it during Sunday our service on Sunday but it's going to be from 12 to 6. if anybody like to donate to this little kid uh to remind me that's why I'm wearing this bracelet we we donated money and then I want to wear this and just keep praying for you just keep praying for him it reminds me to pray for him maybe we ought to wear a bunch of these up for arm problem people downstairs would remind us to pray for all these people and uh and that because he needs prayer he's a little small three-year-old uh student and probably doesn't realize what's going on but you know God has the answer to all things that's right Remember by web announcements let's get finished with this brother Samson shetty's going to be here one day next week next week next Wednesday next Wednesday and then brother Samuel prakash cook that is going to be with us on September the 9th and then remember that June and I are leaving August the 31st we're going to brother Ron Spencer's um camp meeting up in Virginia until be back on September the 4th so just keep us in your prayers we'll be traveling during that time I also remember September the 8th will be a Minister's meeting at brother Bill yount's Church it will be on the Daniel 70 weeks and Dan and I are going to be the guest speakers so just keep us in your prayers because we are I'd rather preach to a bunch of Center I hope this don't go out too far I'd rather preach a bunch of Center than to preach to a bunch of preachers so that's why brother Jess always said before he got real sick and I had a chance to sit down with him he said he said you know I always took the preacher out he said I had more problems with preachers than I did anybody he said I take a preacher out by mistakes and while he was eating that steak of course he was up again to eat it because it was free he said while that preacher was that a big old bite of steak in his mouth chewing and he said I talked to him and he said he couldn't talk back but he had to sit there and even listen so it's good to be good to be that to where brother Jesse used a lot of wisdom as far as talking to preachers because they said they had more problems the preachers than he did with the lady and that's about the same way it is around the message but now September the 15th will be a fellowship meeting at brother call my londorius I think yes and I don't know who's going to be the speaker there but if anybody would like to go that just kind of covers another few weeks of going and doing and trying to serve the Lord all right we got your Bibles let's turn to Romans 1 and tonight I um I sat down a couple days ago and was trying to uh we've been doing working on the fifth seal downstairs and it just didn't seem right to go that way um of course we're doing it in a Sunday school class but uh I couldn't get away from this thought and that's the just shall live by faith yeah you know from what you know brother Keith was preaching this weekend or whatever right and what brother Quinn had been preaching the week before you know about wisdom and and brother Keith showing us that we are to be agents of adoption there's got to be a journey though to where the that you've got to see that God has made you just as righteous as he is glory and it starts with believing it exactly the just shall live by faith that was Martin Luther's theme is that right right and Martin Luther preached justification is that correct all right but now he preached it in a in a way that that's a little it's not different than what we're looking at it at but it was his journey complete Journey Through the church ages us as Christians in this end time it's part of our journey right we can't stay in justification we got to move on God moved on so we have to move on all right God had to leave that denominational idea that that look not Luther had but the lutherans right took Luther's message and denominated it and then God said no that's not it because they put a period and then they started over and said this is it and they stayed here and God moved on to sanctification well that's what you and I have got to do because if you stop at justification in this end time you're not born again right all right so we're going to go through just a small form but we're going to not use one quote we're going to use all scripture in the Bible so we're gonna we're gonna burn the screen up this evening and uh Lord will try to get through some things that maybe hadn't seen about just but Luther remember Luther came out of the Catholic church where you had to do Penance you had to do work you had to do this you had to do that and finally God revealed to him brother Chris that hey the just man shall live by faith right that's right and if you will that's going to be in habakkuk we're going to read it in a minute too but that's where it came from that was the first time it was mentioned and you'll see that it's a little bit different variation of what habakkuk said as to what we're going to read here in Romans so I know we have requests and we prayed again but if you got something on your heart that you want to raise your hand and say God's save my children and uh you know anything you just raise your hand and then we're going to Bow our heads and do like brother Keith said we're just going to start claiming these things right man that's right Mountain be thou moved right all right dear heavenly father we pray Lord you'd come Among Us in a special way tonight Lord it should take all the doubt and fear and anxiety and things of the world that You O Lord just as we say to leave them at the back door that you'll come and reveal yourself to us Lord that in a form of justification Lord that we if we don't see that with the judge shall truly live by faith then Lord it is worse then Lord it is something that I did or or someone did but we're going to read in the Bible where you told a man named job that his that his justification was nothing because he tried to justify himself but Lord if you'll justify us tonight if you'll take us and walk us through these scripture Glory this is the Eternal Word of God that we'll be talking about for all eternity but you give us Lord a space of time to to talk about these things and to realize that truly we are justified by faith we got to have faith in something so Lord let us put our faith in the word of God let us put our faith in you tonight Lord and for all the ones that had their hands lifted up mine was lifted too Lord save my children saved Lord the ones that are lost the ones that are on the on the wall downstairs Lord that that you'll take and bring them in Lord one by one we see Lord the hand of God moving in many lives but we pray Lord that you just continue to do that continue to move in our life Lord be in with each one here Lord tonight take care of them Father we pray Lord that you forgive us of our sins and our thoughts and our ideas against you Lord that you'll give us strength Lord for the Bible this ahead take care of us Lord tonight lead us and guide us be with the ones that are not here that are sick you said you sent your word and healed them Lord so as the word Goes Forth Lord may you heal each one of us may you buy the Brokenhearted Lord free the captain the ones Lord that have demons hanging over their head Lord May May the clouds be moved back tonight by the word of God and by the testimony Lord that we give father just bless us now and take care of us be with a little bride around the world be with the missionaries on the Foreign Fields Lord give them strength give them fruit for their labor Lord and we know you will father for we ask these things in the love of the name of Jesus Christ amen amen and the bride says amen amen Romans 1 verse 16. we're going to pick some of these scriptures out so if you want to keep your Bible you can or we can do it on the screen and I'm going to read it out of my Bible because I have things written inside of it that I want to uh to bring out for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone does what believeth right not just believe but believeth amen amen justification is an ongoing act to the Jews first and also to the Greek for their end is the righteousness of God reveal from Faith to Faith therein what they're in the gospel right right for therein therein where the gospel of Christ is the righteousness of God revealed so it's got to be a revelation from Faith to Faith as it is written the just shall live by faith now let's go to habakkam two and four that'll be hard to find so we'll just read it right here tobacco two enforces behold his soul which is lifted up is not upright by himself a little bit different there's a word added in there but the just shall live by his faith amen all right it's not it's not really yours you're supposed to have faith and that's pretty personal to the just shall live by his faith right now you may be seated and the Lord has blessing and reading of the word and I brought the Greek Mexican words which which most of them are going to be common to each one of us but let's go through them one more time because we got a lot of new ones here and maybe some of them will click in online that that's um it's just starting in a Christian journey I believe God uh you know as well as I do how how uh the Lord brings out things to a pastor and he brings it and he comes back around and he circles back around he circles back around well what's he doing he's picking up all the ones that need to be picked up right amen because I believe one thing's for sure we need an experience amen we need an experience from God right right um a lot of us a lot of you uh you know you just appear in a church and then you just are here well that's what I said about Wednesday night and Sunday we just appeared do we just appear are we here to get up Revelation right are we here to know exactly where we are brothers you can know where you are at any time wow you got to look into the word the word of God will tell you where you're at right all right at any one time but let's look at this word justification I looked up it's a word just justify justification Justified Justified and all these things but look at some of these there's nothing negative about justification amen it's all positive right right it means to be righteous to be just to be right to be meat and it's also righteous judgment because you and I being being justified of what we've done makes us where we can be just enough to judge others right everybody understand that just enough to judge others because you got to be at a place uh we were talking uh a guy from the from Dave Ramsey called me yesterday yeah he did a guy from Dave Ramsey called me yesterday want to know how the the class was going because we were one of the first ones to start the new class and I told him I said well the the lady that did our first class she was not very good at what she was doing because she didn't follow what the teachings were and that'd be like brother they were getting up here teaching you a trinity but wanting you to believe one guy yeah you know in that same way with her it wasn't there wasn't anything fruitful come out of it much except it made me a desire it gave me a desire to do what was said and then to teach it to other people and that's the same way with God is that God is with us he don't want us to have somebody that's that's um let's put it this way it looks whirling to be an example to the church right and it's like it's like you know we were watching the class last Sunday and Dave's right when he said he said God's not going to give you what you can't handle right he knows what you can handle right if you can't handle money he's not gonna give you any more that's right if you can't handle personal finances you're not gonna get you anymore right if you can't handle God's word he's not going to give you any more but there's steps to where you can that's why we have to start at justification we have to start somewhere where God says you're just right and then we have to believe that that's what God Said Amen because what we say about it we're going to read job in a minute job was talking about him being judged that's not good right there's nothing good about my own Justice all right it's just what God's just God is going to give us and that's why I was making an example for those of you that were in class you know we were talking about this downstairs but I believe this you'd say whatever you want to brother Dale's been successful because he's not fleece to people for money we know these preachers many preachers that they get themselves in such a bind and they get themselves where they can't make their bills and they need two thousand dollars a week so they to live so they fleece the people you know oh they don't do that right he made it and that's the same way I was saying well I'm trying to get myself to where if something ever happens to brother Dale and you have to vote a pastor in and I'm the assistant pastor you've got to vote me in if something happens I'm saying I'm not saying you got to vote me in but I'm saying I'm in line to just kind of help until y'all find somebody but why would you find somebody that was off the word had 50 million dollars in debt bounced 150 checks would you put somebody like that in the pulpit God's not going to trust you with the word if you do the same thing with what he gives you right right you ought to think about that man but God has made it to where there's a place and I'm making a point he's made it where there's a place of where you look at that where it says innocent right faultless Guiltless right now all those things we've done in the past we've got to believe and justification we said well that's baby form justification and God forgive us of our past sins and we're just getting started and we're just newborn babies but my Heavens people look what it says when we Guiltless Brother David whatever you've done in your past if you're truly Justified God don't know that anymore right God don't even account that to you anymore right if he means Guiltless that means if I went to court and somebody said you did so and so if they found me Guiltless if I didn't do it then I'd never done it right they can't put me in jail right that's why we're going to look later on when we start reading scripture we're going to see that if it's not by faith and then we're going to move to see that it is by works and faith but if it's not by faith if we don't believe that then we're not justified that's why that's one Luther said the judge shall live by faith right his faith tobacco said right your faith makes it personal the judge I'm going to live by my faith right amen that's right exactly because I'm not born again at justification right remember you have faith when you're born again right you have his faith when you're born again exactly I got to have my faith to believe I'm heading toward that right all right everybody understand that right approved of or acceptable of God you're Justified today if you're just a newborn babe God has accepted you and approved of you right in justification now I'm not saying that's where he's pleased to dwell he's not pleased to dwell right now but he has accepted something right right he's accepted your faith amen where you gotta confess we're going to read that by your words you are Justified and by your words you're condemned right by your words not his words your words but when we come under the born-again experience then it's all what he does good right justification is our works amen I'm gonna read James in a minute James is going to tell us we got to have work because words without faith is dead right all right so we can't be justified and not have an experience you've got to have an experience of justification right not just saying I'm Justified you've got to have an experience that's what I was telling when we were we're baptizing them there uh the other day when when you go down in that water that old man's dead that old man is buried right if you dig him up you're going to have a stinking carcass on your hands but he's dead because you are working to something God counts you innocent and faultless you'll go to heaven right right right you won't be Brian let's don't talk don't worry about that let's just talk about babies right newborn babies in Christ brother Brown said sure you'll go to heaven right right because you have been forgiven of your past amen now what you do further you got to give an account for right right some of you that are starting out and you're still doing things wrong don't worry about that right you say God I believe because it's him his faith amen my faith I gotta believe amen we know that turns into God's face but I got to stand somewhere and say hey I believe that I don't have to pay Penance I don't have to to do novenas I don't have to you know go to the Baptist Church and Shake somebody's hand right no I just gotta believe all right that God has forgive me of my sins right there amen right right there amen that's not gonna stop the devil but it is going to put a spot down like I told him drive a state down and say Satan right there that's where the old man died and leave it alone right because you're working towards something now you stay that way see even even Judas even Judas was justified we know the prophet told us that Judas was justified Jesus was sanctified but he didn't go on right to the new birth right but he was justified but he was forgiven of this past but he had a present and a future that he had to worry about because he didn't go on and get covered right under the blood because we're going to read in just a minute I don't think we're going to get done with this all right go to the second one here's another one Justified be free be righteous the justifier to render righteous or such he ought to be in other words you're working towards something to show exhibit events one to be righteous such as he is and wishes himself to be considered in other words when we put him in down in baptism that's what that shows that that's an outward expression that an inward Works being done that's what they're saying and wishes himself to be considered you're you're welcome into the family of God right right right that's right I know your name goes on the book of sanctification as a Believer but you know what you got to be justified first right right exactly you've got to show that something is going on and wishes himself to be considered to declare pronounce one to be just righteous or such as he ought to be all right let's go to the next one number three or we're not going to get finished with these scriptures tonight the Lord justification the act of God declaring men free from guilt and acceptable to him as enduring to be righteous in other words working towards right or justification the act of God declaring men free from guilt and acceptable to him God accepts your faith at justification right because you don't have his faith yet you're starting you got a beginning part of his faith but you got to learn just like just like riding a bicycle just like anything else you're gonna you know you're gonna fall you're gonna fall you're gonna fall but once you get to learn how to ride a bicycle do it you just jump on it and go you don't even think about it same way with God if you start out right you only end right amen amen that's what I'm trying to see make each and every one of us realize that not just walking in a message church and sitting down and appealing for 10 or 15 years I told him downstairs in a Sunday school class and I mean this from the bottom of my heart if you're the same spot you were at two years ago you're either backslid or you lost right right one other two right back later lost I got quiet yeah but I'm telling you if we don't it what brother Brown says we stop God keeps moving right right right if we stop then wherever we left God at right there he's gone on right somebody else is going on all right all right let's go now and let's read let's do number four right here this is a good one to be just be righteous to have a just cause being the right see because it's the right thing to do you're going to have problems you're going to have things that's still going to bother you but it's the right thing to do to start and say God I'm going to do what you say I'm going to have faith that you've done what you said you're going to do if you don't then you always going to have them all sins and they're going to pop up anyway because you're gonna you got them in your brain sure right right that's right man all that that we've done David before we were born again we still remember it right God of God will do away with it and it's going good time but the devil doesn't know that he just keeps coming oh yeah but you know what you do though you just let him slide right off right but see being the right to be justified to be just of God to be righteous in conduct and character you think well that should be sanctification No it should be that you begin somewhere right to say I've changed right I'm Gonna Change amen all right to be put made right be justified see there's nothing negative to this it's to me it's to point us in the right direction what is repent brother Brian said repent was turn around that's right and walk in a different way right that's why the Bible says walk in newness of life to do bring justice justice to declare righteous justify to justify vindicate the cause of right man that's a good one have you been Vindicated amen right not by man but by God have you been Vindicated has gone Vindicated God's Vindicated the ministry in this church he's Vindicated the people in his church he's Vindicated what's going on all right so what must be Jeff okay must be just that's right we got to be gesture God won't do it all right even to be successful in life people you got to start somewhere and you got to turn around from what you were doing right right you know the old saying is if you aim at nothing you'll hit it every time right but you gotta aim for something you gotta you gotta get a goal and say I'm gonna and you know you say well yeah that's just Mind Over Matter maybe that's where y'all start yeah that's where it begins at you know the beginning of mine right well you all the team try to change that thing try to change our our thoughts and our ideas but God somewhere is going to vindicate your justification that's right because you're gonna go man that don't bother me anymore right right I don't say that stuff anymore I really do like going to church yeah right I really do like being around these nutty people they're different that's what I want to be right I want to buy this say I'm normal I'm not normal I'm different God likes people being different right people like the same old same old same old no I want somebody to be different see vindicate the cause of so he's going to vindicate your cause and your cause the Bible says is cause what for Christ right all right so that's the main focus reason I'm doing this is because and I I was thinking that this morning there's only going to be a very small group of people that's in this end time that's even even in this church age that's heard of this message and the things of the message that you hear here like seals and and Daniel 70 weeks and how God sent a prophet and all these things that don't make you say right no that's right the Bible tells you how to get saved right now we know the prophet preached out of the Bible and he made this thing very plain to us very plain but Salvation did not come through a prophet right salvation didn't come through brother Brandon right he didn't save nobody that's right not one person exactly God is the one he had to go back into the scripture and pull out the things and say hey this is the right way I love it on on the future home brother Brown said I've come this far and still I see the three same works of Grace that he preached when he first started which was justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost the earth goes through the same thing the same thing we go through it first justification David under justification God SWAT this whole world off with what water right water baptism right he baptized his whole earth Justified it right that's right but what happened when men come up he just starts sinning again right because justification doesn't it chops off your past sin but it doesn't do anything for you present right so there's your your guide that's what he done with Noah he wiped the whole earth off and sin just went right on down into sanctification Jesus had to come and drip his blood on this Earth to do what cleanse and claim everything that was in the earth and where was your body your body was in this earth right so when that blood dripped on on the earth the blood is the sanctifier amen all right we know the life and the blood but the look the blood dripping was the sanctification that changed things amen sanctification changes you that's where you really gonna see a change that's where I I'm just speaking from experience here I'm not the woman that taught the class that didn't do anything it was taught in the class I know a little bit I've had a journey I've been somewhere you know I've got a cause and I believe God's Vindicated the cause but we come to a spot to where that the J you got to see that justification was Noah sanctification when Jesus uh spilled his blood on the Earth but you and I come through justification sanctification the baptism with the Holy Ghost this earth is waiting for a baptism when all this sin is finished that's why the Holy Ghost burns the sin off right so he's got to burn the Earth off right right he's got to burn up the centers and the and the uh he got really burn the centers up and that last burning he burns the soul right the soul of that Sinner's gone it's not on this Earth anymore that's why it's your that's why in your new birth that's what happens justification sin just continued sanctification sin discontinued but once you're born again sin could continue amen continue in in the inward man right same thing with Earth he can't step foot on his Earth just like just like God said I'll not dwell on an unclean vessel right right you and I he won't dwell in an unclean vessel well he can't put his foot on this Earth until we get rid of the sin and then God's made manifest in us and this thing our hair has changed right pretty simple but pretty profound so let's go to Romans 8. now let's read ruins hey I got more read out of my Bible because like I said I've got some points that I want to I don't want to show all right everybody okay yeah I gotta come down here Benny said all we got was my bald head back in my bald head the other night so I'm gonna try to move over here a little bit moreover whom he did predestinate Demi also called he called you right that's right what then there's your cause you make a move toward that man all right this might be simple but we need it for whom he did let's read moreover whom he did predestinate and he also called who he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified if you're truly Justified then this scripture tells me you're just as just as God is if you walk in the way he knows if you will or not he knows if you'll stop he knew Judas was going to stop at sanctification that wasn't a that wasn't a uh a surprise to the Lord the Lord knew it from the beginning right what shall we say to these things if God be for us who can be against him he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not win him also freely give us all things Glory through him who shall lay anything who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect amen it is God that justifies not man it is God no preacher nobody can justify you all right we're all born in sin we're all shaping iniquity we all got problems we all got things that we've done we were born the same way every one of us what but who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect if God has Justified you back and I'm not changing scripture that's exactly what he said right all right it is God that justified who is he that condemneth who is he to condemneth right is Christ that died yeah whatever it is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us all right let's go to let's go to now this is this is where job is going to get in trouble yeah job says if I justify myself my own mouth shall condemn me hello right my own mouth will condemn me in other words I'll be able to want to show it you don't have to tell me I'll condemn my own self right if I say I am perfect it shall also prove me perverse that is what this is then you come down to joke 32 elohu comes out right job's like I didn't do this I didn't do that I didn't do this do's and don'ts and don'ts that's what he was doing right I didn't do this I didn't do that then was kindled the wrath of Elohim in the scripture is a type of who Christ remember that's the one right he had three three people that that condemned him and then eliu comes on the same which is a type of Christ then which kindled the wrath of Elohim the son of bear shell of the Buddha of the Kindred of ram against job was his wrath Kendall because he justified himself rather than God right in other words God hadn't Justified job was trying to justify himself right and elohu comes down and tells him a few things but we don't have time to get in that let's go to proverbs 17. listen to this eat it Justified at the wicked and he that condemneth the judge even they both are an abomination to the Lord you can't justify wickedness right right that's what he's saying you can't justify wickedness and you if you condemn the just you're condemning God right that's why Satan can come and he can accuse you and condemn you but God's the only one that you need to listen to about condemnation right condemn you always forget it period he's going to condemn you remember in Romans 8 1 it says there's therefore now no condemnation to who to them who are in Christ Jesus not the regular world but to those who are in Christ Jesus so he that condemning to just even they both are an Abomination to the Lord so in other words that's why the Bible said you speak evil against a man of God and whatever you speak just made it back to you right amen right so we need to be careful right Isaiah 45 25 and the Lord in the Lord there's your key in the Lord shall the seed of Israel be justified and shall Glory right all right now we're going to move into the New Testament into Matthew Matthew 12 36 and listen to what he says here but I say unto thee that Every Idle word that men shall speak your testimony right Every Idle word that men shall speak right they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment amen for by thy words Thou shalt be justified in other words what is it your confession which is your faith that's where it comes from right it comes from right here first you've got to confess it by thy words thou shall be thou shalt be justified and by my words Thou shalt be condemned right spoken word that's where it comes from because Jesus said out on the heart proceedeth all things and what not the heart the the thumping gizzard out of the heart in other words out of your being the mouth speaks all right you know brother Brown said you know give me two minutes with a guy I'll tell you whether he's born again or not let me go to his house let me see what he listens to hey you know it's kind of like in the in the course the fbu course we're doing you can do that with your checkbook it's an accountability thing if you go down through the chat button you see beer wine cigarettes well you know that guy's not a Christian all right you look through the check register you know you look through my check register says hunting dude hunting do hunting dude hunting magazines yeah hunting clothes no I play guns cash hunt clothes but if you see that then you see my characteristic is that what I spend my money on because the Bible says where your heart is that's where your riches are right right all right so you see that I'm a Hunter some of you you can go to look down to them see that you're a fisherman some people go after their look that you don't go to church and pay your car the whole lot yeah for by thy words Thou shalt be justified and by thy words Thou shalt be condemned let me tell you something the Bible says the little things it's the little foxes that spoil the mind not the big wolf not the big bear it's your little attitude right my little attitude right for by thy words Thou shalt be justified and by Thy word thou shalt be condemned uh I Think Jesus said that it's in red letter right we need to work on that Joe see if we can get one without red letter in it just make it all ready yeah all right let's go to the next one Luke 18. listen to what he says the Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself God I think thee that I'm an adopted son of God and I don't fellowship with people and and I've missed Church half the time and and and I talk about to be told and I do this and I do that and I'm not like that guy that comes to church every Sunday and the guy that perseveres I fast twice a week I give ties of all that I possess yeah now this is Jesus Jesus is telling this Parable and Republicans standing afar off would not lift up so much of his eyes into heaven but schmote his breasts and said God be merciful to me a sinner now this is what Jesus said I tell you this man went home to his house Justified right rather than the other for everyone that exalted himself shall be abased right and everyone that humbles himself shall be exhausted right you see what happened you watch Jesus he's watching these Pharisees and that's the same way we gotten a message we got Pharisees we got Sadducees it's just different people same spirit Spirit doesn't die the spirit just came over here that's what we were talking about the other day the Pharisees and Sadducees were so close to Jesus right they were confronting each other all the time because it was too religious um people I say are two religious items coming together keep bringing the true word of God and them thinking they're the word of God same way in the message same way in the messages ways Pharisees the second season the message same as they are we're back then right and they're turning God down we be of Abraham we be of this camper we be of William Brown yeah yeah no I want to be of God because that's what God says right here that Publican who said God be merciful I don't want us ever to forget that we were Sinners to me man exactly if we ever forget that we were Sinners only I know we're supposed to come to adoption and all that stuff and that's fine but you know what you're still a center right brother said you sin every day he said that when he was adopted right we said every day have to have forgiveness be forgiven Glory okay so let's just be humble and then God will put you in the front seat amen remember brother Brown was talking about that guy that came up to the pulpit and he was so exalted and sold this and so that but he came back down humble and he said if he'd have went up the way he came down right right he wouldn't win he wouldn't have went down the way he came up or he lost the virtually everyone that worked but that's the way he was saying if he wasn't very humble because you know what even in justification to remember the almighty God has wiped your book amen whatever was written about you from the day you walked up here and said God forgive me of my sins I am a sinner and I want to do something about it I want you to do something about it from that day back I don't care what you did but he said well maybe I'll blasphemy no if you're standing right here with his tears in your eyes and you really are repenting you never blast me right from if you blaspheme you never can come to God you never will want to come to God but if you did God took that book that he was writing that we were talking about the other day God writes and Records your life and he cleaned that sucker just clean as it could be right now from that day forward he keeps he starts recording Again The Angels start recording but from that day back because we're going to read scripture in just a minute where Paul said search for some of you whoremunders thieves murderers robbers effeminate we're going to read it in a minute he said but such were some of you right amen but you are washed but you are Justified so Justified is not just some little baby form that we that we think well we need to just get Justified so we can go get in the Sanctified condition and we start shouting and praising God now if you get Justified you ought to shout and praise God right because he's done away with your past sins you're done I mean as far as brother Brown said you die that day you go to heaven right what happened that's what happened to the thief on the cross right right God said this day you'll be with me in Paradise in other words this day from this day whatever you've done from that day back I don't even count it to you right if he had one thing against him he couldn't win the paradise right right couldn't win so think about justification a little bit more light than you're saying well I'm Justified no it's a big deal right big deal all right let's go to Isaiah 53 11. so this is what happened job was trying to justify himself man has always tried to justify even we do in our human life we try to justify what we do right yeah all right that's what we get in trouble now watch what God did God came down in human flesh to do one thing right he shall see the travail of his soul that was the soul of almighty God it was hanging on that cross and he shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many right one act and he justified many for he shall bear their iniquity because he didn't have any to take with him to the Cross he took hours right all right see we get away from that back to my point there's going to be billions of people in heaven there's not going to hear about the seals there's not going to hear about the damn 70 weeks it's not going to hear about William Brown being a prophet but the Bible's full of it but the Bible's full of how to get saved first yeah right get them to Christ first start acting right start doing right and then the message will come I don't like these just these readers that's what we've become just a bunch of readers we can read quotes when I was a sinner doing things in the world I knew what the Bible said about it serpent seed the devil noted I was thinking about this this morning the devil knows more about surfacing we do yeah right he was there right right yeah he was the one doing the talking right yeah so he wasn't fooled right then the Bible says that he knows there's only one God right and he feeds us a Trinity right so the devil sometimes a lot more religious than we are and that's the problem is being religious but but you know about the serpent seed brother Brown said it's just you can read that in the Bible in order to be able to prove that right you know Jim was talking to uh to my cousin the other day and and they were just you know mystified about how how uh Jim could go through the scripture and she wasn't preaching to him but she was testifying no you know she just said simply she said you believe it was an apple do you really believe it was an apple yeah it caused all this and they just kind of looked at each other you know kind of dumbfounded and she said did they go put fig leaves on their hands in their mouth yeah teaching all they covered up their private part right so where do you think the shame came from right all right so just simple stuff like that and then they're like and then one of them I think one of the other ones said to said to my cousin said well last day on Friday yeah well you know I'm but the guy one of my point is the guy's not born again let's go and put our our reference them we can tell whatever seal is and we can tell whatever vial is or we can tell whatever that's just being able to read right but when you put this thing in here yeah brother Brown said he's got to come off these pages and come in here before you repeat the devil you can't defeat to that one by reading it to him right right did you see where Keith was was preaching Sunday where and Jesus and I showed him one point which is in the Book of Luke the first time that Satan comes to Jesus Jesus said it is written right right did Satan move stayed right there didn't he yeah second time Jesus said it is written Satan stayed right there the last thing Jesus said he said it is said and when he said it said the Bible says Satan left him right see it's written as long as it stays on the page right it's just somebody saying just some somebody's saying what somebody else said but when he said it is sad glory in other words when he became what that was Lord he became what that was he spoke to him he said it says Thou shalt not have no other gods or in other words you know um have any other gods worship any other God Satan had to leave when he said it it said but when it was written he could stay right there right when it's written he can stay right there right same thing in justification Satan's gonna stay right around you because he don't want you to realize that you're in a that you're in a position to move toward God because we know God does the calling we know God does all that but we got to make a move amen you got to make a move right so move his faith right you got to step out on faith and say God I believe that's what you've done to me right what's in the Bible not what a prophet said or not what this one said but take the Bible and read the Bible a newborn Christian ought to read the Bible that's true that's right amen but if you can understand the Bible then you'll definitely go to the prophet's message and see where there's a love letter in between those lines God's trying to tell you hey I want some more right of you right that's right I want to give you more of me and it's right here right some people have put me in a written word which is fine but I want to make that word disappear in here amen and then come alive all right and that's where it is going to be a life live if we don't live that life people we are missing it brother Brown said it's in the walk it's in that life that we live and I know we all have problems but we got to start cutting these things out that's actually a perfect man is a honing time amen get the rough edges off all right we all got rough edges but we got to we got to bind together all right all right let's go acts 13 38. be it known unto you therefore men in Brethren that through this man this is Paul through this man has preached unto you the Forgiveness of sins and by him all that believe are Justified from all things you read that from all things from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses exactly so you can't be justified by do's and don'ts right you can't be justified by the law because the law says you are condemned right right you are condemned you are condemned you are condemned you are condemned do this don't do that that's what Rome picked up that's what the Roman Catholic Church picked up as far as do's and don'ts that's why Martin Luther had to walk down and say hey that's not what the Bible's saying right the Bible's saying the just the just shall live by faith right not by work exactly but worse goes along with it like I said we're going to read it later all right now let's go to Romans three I love the book of Romans if you want to talk about justification amen read Romans 3 Romans 4 and Romans five and we're gonna read part of it here but let's break it down a little bit Romans 3 four and five so let's start right here at Romans three and I really like what what brother baseball said about Abraham he kind of held the book The Bible I can't do it with mine because it's about to fall apart I gotta get another one here pretty quick but uh that means it's been used a little but he takes that part right there where it says New Testament and he held that up and I'm not going to do it with mine because it'll fall apart he held that up and he see what I mean and he um he held it up and he said now what got what what the Bible says about Abraham is over here he lied give his wife away done all those things right but when you look through to the New Testament when you look through the blood look through the end of the New Testament all that got left behind right yep right and over here we're going to read that he staggered not at the promise of God through faith he did all these things he did all these things right why he went through the blood right God had to come into a new testament the Old Testament couldn't do it for him man it had to be a new testament it had to be it had to be the word of God Written in Blood written in his blood right to even make the Old Testament Justified right all right because Abraham wasn't just doing what he done but but in in Abraham's walk what does brother Branham attribute justification to Abraham getting up and starting his walk right there in about 12 to 14 somewhere in that 15. he says Abraham got up God said hey come I need you to go well he did come and he did go but what he done he didn't do all what God told him to do he said I want you to get up and walk with me right he brought his uncle and his father and his whoever lot was his cousin God didn't tell him to do that but see we do that in justification because we don't really understand God at this time right right God tells us to come to church he tells us to do the things to pay our time to to do the right things in life but there's a lot of other things that we do sure because in sanctification see that starts washing away that starts going away from me at sanctification but in justification you still you got a lot of baggage Abraham a lot of time out of baggage right you slowed him down right that's what he was God said hey come up I want you to take a journey so he goes and gets a lot and the lights always they're always dividing stuff up and they're always talking about God didn't want that God wants you to walk straight down that line amen all right so now let's look at Romans this I love Romans like I said three four and five if you want to read about justification and know where and how justification works in your life read Romans three four and five amen now we know that what thing so ever the law saith it say after them that are under the law if you're not born again you're still not at all if you're Justified you're still under the law yeah all right because it is a little bit it is do's and don'ts we're going to read what James says but you got to believe somewhere that God has done something in your life and you're going to move amen that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before God right that's not what we want because listen even in a Justified condition if you were to die you're going to go to heaven but you still got to go and walk before that white Throne judgment and give an account and for example one little thing and you missed it that's why I'm born again born again is in the Judgment not being judged right right all right but you're if you're Justified or if you're Sanctified and you die you'll be given eternal life that's what the prophet said because you got your passing you're in a walk of God God understands where you're going to be and where you're not going to be all right but you're gonna have to stand before that judgment right there and all the world is guilty before God right all the world all right therefore by the Deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in a sign right amen for by the law is the knowledge of sin I did this I did that I cursed right I run around with women I smoke I drink I did these things but now the righteousness of God without the law is matter of fact being witnessed by the law and the prophets they spoke of something to come even the righteousness of God which is by what faith of Jesus Christ he raised for our justification we didn't raise for it he raised to justify me and you even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe for there's no difference amen for all of sin and come short of the glory of God right he's Paul's lumping everybody in in this in this problem here exactly but look being justified freely by his grace through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus you believed him you believed that's what he done and God has set forth to be a perpetuation through faith in his blood right not faith in this and that and the other faith in his blood that that man was God Almighty and he died for your sins to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are what passed there's justification sins that are passed right through the forbearance thank God God Is forbearing Right Through the forbearance of God to declare I say at this time his righteousness not not polished that he might be just and to justifier of him which believeth in Jesus man there's your justification he's just laying it right down right very simple Blair is boasting then all right job was boasting I've done this I haven't done that I I'm this I'm that I'm the other where is boasting then it's excluded right right by what law of Works hey but by the law of Faith man therefore we conclude I like Paul because he brings it right now he brings it a funk it's a big old funnel then he brings it right down to a point right therefore we conclude in other words the conclusion of all this that a man is justified by faith without the Deeds of the law man do this don't do that is he the god of the Jews only is he not also of the Gentiles yes of the Gentiles also seeing is one God which shall justify the circumcision by faith and the uncircumstances look at the difference he's going to justify the circumcision by faith right which was who the Jews yeah right they were the circumcised we were there uncircumcised and the uncircumcision through faith we got to believe that that happened exactly do we then make boy to law through faith God forbid that we're not we'll see that hey there you go you you can't do away well I don't have to worry about the law anymore no the law is always there right okay but through faith do we void the law through faith God forbid yeah we established a law right listen folks people talk about ten commandments we're the only people if you're born again tonight you're the only person that is able to live the Ten Commandments amen right so we're the only ones able to live the law right we are right we are the only ones that can live the law exactly because somewhere else you can't live the law if you're not born again do we then make boy the law through faith God forbid we established the law right right all right let's go to Romans 4. now look if you look in your Bible Romans 3 runs right down and I read the last scripture Romans 4. he just continuing his thought man put that 4-1 remember when the Bible was written it was written just continuous right man put the chapters in there right we broke them up in chapters so this is Paul this is his thought continuing what shall we say then that Abraham go back can you go back one brother Joe my brother Anderson no don't go back 331. go back to 331 yeah the scripture before or no just reverse it go back to the scripture we were just reading all right go on no go to Romans 3 19 through 31. yeah the one we were just on because I want to read I want to read there you go right there I knew you could do that seeing it as one God but shall justify the circumcision by faith in the united circumcision to Faith I want you to see what Paul's thought is do we then make boy the law through faith God forbid we establish the law just scroll up because his thought just continued in Romans 4 just keep going to Romans 4. what shall we say then did Abraham our father has pertaining to the flesh has found right for If Abraham would Justify both works now what do you talk about before you just continue to install it for If Abraham were justified by words he have to wear off the glory right I did this I didn't do that but not before God for what saith the scripture Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness that's what Abraham did he just believed God he got up and started walking he was just in what he was doing right now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of Grace but of death if you just knew by words work it but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justified the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness right so Paul that's why everybody thinks Paul's kicking works out the door and bringing faith in and and James is kicking Faith out the door and bringing Works in no we're going to show our faith by our works amen all right we're going to show what we believe right we're going to show What We Believe by The Works that we do man right actually right whether you like it or not we're going to show what we believe the only way we can show what we believe is by this guy right here right black brother Keith is talking about the only way God's going to be manifest is by this right here right he's going to work through us he's not coming down beside of us and he's not coming over here for us to look to describes no it's crashed in you that's right the hope of glory all right now to him that worketh is a reward not reckoned of Grace but a debt back to him that work is not but believeth on him that justifyeth it ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness so it's not then Paul's saying I mean he's saying it's not all works you got to have faith right because by your work shows your faith right and if you have faith you'll have work Glory right right right you have faith you're going to have work right even as David also describeth the blessedness of man unto whom God imputed righteousness without works remember Davidson blesses the man who God will not impute sin right well that's what Paul is kind of showing you what he was really saying even as David also described the blessedness of the man unto whom God impedeth righteousness will not work right saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is a man to own the Lord will not impute or count right or put to your account sin right all right now let's continue to go to Romans 4 25 we took a little bit out of this but look Abraham staggered not he said he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief now when we look back on the account we say there's part of the account says that he did stagger yeah laughed at God give his wife away looks like he really didn't do a whole lot but look through the blood coming over on this side that he was strong in faith well you know what even though Abraham did all that stuff God counted his faith yeah as righteousness right not his work but his faith because he wasn't born again born against when you put the works and the faith together right right right because they did a lot of Works in David's time David was one of them too kind of a rascal but he wasn't born again right amen but he was just then that God said hey that guy is my guy if he would be in the New Testament he'd be a lot better off but he's not in it he become an example in the Old Testament but if you brought David and give him the new birth he wouldn't act like he did that's right right but so then it is David what he done but if you come over here works and Faith's got to be together amen you can't be born again and have a different kind of work amen ain't gonna happen because by your faith you're going to show your words like we're going to show in a minute yeah go to Romans 5 1. therefore this is the keep him coming down who was delivered for our fans now look and therefore it was appeared in Verizon this now it was not written for his sake alone and it was imputed to him in other words written for us but us also to whom it shall be imputed or counted if big word if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our lord from the dead who has the who was delivered for not his offense but our offense yeah and was raised again prior justification he was raised one time physically right prove who he was right remember he proves who he was when he raised from the dead but he's got to raise again in me and you for our justification we gotta accept that and it become part of us all right Romans 5 1 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen now let's go to Galatians 2. knowing that a man is not justified by The Works of the law but by the faith of Jesus Christ now this Paul's continuing the thought counter but he's over in Galatians now giving you just a little bit different angle through the Holy Spirit the holy spirit's kind of showing you he's giving you no loophole to get through as far as works and Faith they've got to work hand in hand knowing that a man is not justified by The Works of the law can't be remember we said he born under the law born in sin Shaker than iniquity but by the faith of Jesus Christ even we have believed in Jesus Christ that we might be justified by the Faith of Christ and not by The Works of the law for by The Works of the law shall no flesh be justified amen but if listen if while we seek to be justified by Christ in other words what we're moving we're looking right we ourselves also were found sinners is therefore Christ the minister of sin no not forbid God forbid if you look you're looking for Christ you're going to see your sins but he don't right right for if I build again the things which I destroyed I make myself a transgressional if I go back and do the same old thing right if I if I build again the things which I destroy now you can't destroy them on your own but you see what Paul's saying I myself a transgressor it's got to be by faith in Jesus Christ all right Galatians 3. for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse and that's right for it is written cursed is everyone that continuous not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God it is evident right four one the just show me a buffet right are you getting anything here the judge the Justified the just people shall live by faith Galatians 5. Christ is become of no effect unto you whosoever of you are justified by the law right you're falling from Grace wow that's pretty stout right Christ is because of no effect unto you whosoever of you that are justified by the law right do this don't do that year falling from Grace for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith right right in other words we walk through justification we walk through sanctification we walk we're waiting on that spirit amen amen repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the mission of your sins and you shall receive the gift shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for that promises to you and your children them that are far off and even this morning many as the Lord Our God shall call for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith all right let's go right here first Corinthians oh let's read this one Galatians 5 this is coming down further but if you buy and divide one another take heed that you be not consumed one of another right this I say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh play for the flesh left this against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh there's the warring and these are contrary one to the other so that you not can do the things that you would right right but if you be led of the spirit amen you're not under law right that's right now the words of the flesh are manifest which are these adulting fornication uncleanness let's save additionally going down through there right are all these now look let's go to First Corinthians here's one know you not let the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God right now stop right there no ye not we know that unrighteous people are not going to heaven right right that's a question mark no ye not he's asking them a question Steve neither fornicators pretty tough idolaters adulterers effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkards nor revolvers we ain't got a chance right nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God and if he had not stopped if he'd have stopped right there when he said in such for some of you we'd be in trouble and sex for some of you right right and you looking at one here I searched for some of you so we're not excluded we weren't born with a silver spoon no matter we weren't born with a seal book in our mouth but ye are washed but ye are sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus that's why we baptize that's that hitting me right there the other day you're Justified not in the name of father son Holy Ghost right right you're justified in the name of the Lord Jesus right and by the spirit of our God glory that's where you're Justified you're not justified by father son Holy Ghost can't be you're justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit amen of our God so every one of us were done and lost know ye not that the unrighteous shall not in here so those people don't have a don't have a chance right unless you get washed right man now when you get washed and when you get Justified what does that do that knocks all that past if you were a drunk and you come to justification all that righteous living before that is over right we Glory when people get the Holy Ghost we do right oh we're just a little praise God yeah why don't we praise God if they're Justified right people that doesn't mean that's not the sweet little lady walking down the street that you know that in other words let's just put it in 2011 2012 language that's not somebody flips you off on the side of the road for passing them or cutting them off no these people are in trouble right these people are in real trouble look at it thieves come with this drunkards revilers adulterers a feminate abusers of himself with mankind pretty right people but you're washed amen that's why when you get baptized in the Lamb of Lord Jesus Christ and you really believe that God forgive you your sins Glory right there everybody let me tell you something that scripture is now of non-fact to you yeah that sucks for some of you right but you're washed amen you're Sanctified amen you're justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit glory amen amen is that scripture then we ought to just absolutely just we ought to shout the house down for the Justified people amen because God's not a word that's a big work in your life man then you walked in God and I hope to God and ain't if you get if you get Justified at 40 years old I hope you don't wait another 40 to get Sanctified all right you should be a little quick short short work in between all those right because if you wait four more years you got 40 more years of sin piled up again all right all right so let's go through justification let's go through sanctification realizing that God's done something in our life right all right now let's go to James let's read James because here is another angle for some of you that that are that are looking in in at the Bible and that are walking in justification it says now what you've said brother wait is that all we got to do is have faith all we got to do is have faith all we got to do is have faith and all we got to do is have faith just have faith don't worry about the works all we gotta do is have faith that's correct because if you have faith you'll have works right because like I said before exactly they will come it's an attribute of being justified his Works an attribute of being Sanctified is the works you do all right because remember brother Brown when he brings justification and sanctification down in the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know the snuff box don't go out at the Holy Ghost the stuff those box go to that sanctification right that's where people are getting a role right well I don't cuss anymore because I'm born again no you shouldn't cuss because you Sanctified it right right vacation takes care of that junk right was not Abraham Our Father justified by works because what did he do God said go take Isaac up to the mountain and kill him right right well it's not Abraham Our Father justified by works but what happened with Abraham's works Abraham's faith got him through that right right he believed and told the people he said the boy and I will return exactly there's Faith right that's calling see to me to me dad that's where that's where the realm was was produced exactly they just went up there and it was made manifested right but the something else was produced as a substitute when he spoke he said me in the lab will come back right here exactly that's right see we think well we got to get right there to the spot and there was the realm no that land that Ram was produced when Abraham said man the last because something he was taking that boy up there to kill him right right he was taking that boy up there to end his life there's no way that boy would walk back down off that mountain with Abraham if he did what God told him right right but when Abraham told him said told those people as a witness remember buy your words by your words you'd be justified by your words Abraham told him said me and the boy are going up and me and the boy are coming back right what's right right there produced The Ram amen because something had to become a substitute from here to there and back right right so when he got there he still was going to do the deed but God stopped him and said Abraham I know right amen I know well God knew it already he just wanted Abraham to know right right he want Abraham knows this again God knows all things but he wants you to know right that he's weaving his way through your life that's why in justification is not something you it's not just a numb feeling you just sat around no you get up and go do something right he told Abraham to get up and go Abraham got up and went exactly right Abraham didn't have a seal book stayed with him he didn't even have a prophet to tell him anything right he just heard a voice right come on people he just heard the voice he didn't hear 12 sermons right he heard a voice Abraham get up you're going to be the father of many nations you go and you start walking right he just gotta win well that's where Abraham was accounted now was not Abraham Our Father justified by words when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar see it's loud how Faith wrought with his worth with his words see his faith went with his works right he went with it right right see how Faith was wrought with his works and by works let's contrary to what Paul's talking about brother Chris by words was his faith made perfect asking a question see see us now how Faith wrought with his Works in other words they work together and by works his faith was made perfect because when he went up on that mountain don't you think Abraham takes his only son he takes Isaac that's the promised son takes him up on the mountain to kill him right if something don't happen if God don't come on the scene that's the end of that promise right that's why I said when Abraham said the boy and I'll return he produced his faith produced but his words had to take him to it right he had to actually go up there and he didn't I don't believe he went Lord come on God no no Abraham God knew Abraham in his mind said God if that's what you told me to do here and he went right at right at the throat right and that angel said nope hang on a minute right hey Grandma no now right well Abraham's Faith was made Strong by that don't you think if I was a man Brother Richard if I was a man and known that God told me to take my only son but that's my promise son and he spared that guy from death and then produce a ram to sacrifice right yeah walking down that mountain buddy Abraham was skipping and jumping and hopping he was the happiest guy in the world not that not only that his son was spared but that he knew he was walking right in the will of God amen amen he within his faith was made Stronger by his words right and by works was Faith made perfect you got to do something you can't just sit around and the scripture was fulfilled which says Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God see he's not even called son God because he wasn't born again called a friend of God right right you see then how that by works a man is Justified and not by faith only because they go together right all right likewise also was not Rahab the Harlot justified by works she was she received the two spies she said spies I'll I'll get you out of here and had sent them out another way remember she got them and said hey if they're fixing to do something do you guys go out this way all right she was justified by works for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works exactly it's dead also so faith without works is dead your faith is going to produce the worst Abraham's Faith at the bottom of that mountain produced that lamb that Ram yeah right right that's what you've got to produce now let's take it in 2012 what brother Dale's been talking about your faith has to produce that lamb me man your face right your faith Keith said Sunday right you say right to this mountain Laura you say to your children you say to your finances you say that he named all that off right you say then your faith your faith and works have to go together amen you can't say I have great faith and not have Works to go with it exactly your work say brother Brown had great faith but look at the works right his Works proved his faith amen all right same way with Abraham same way with me and you know let's go to the next one let's go to Hebrews 10. listen to this but we have need of patience that after that after ye have done the will of God you might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not carry now the just shall live by faith amen but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him right you won't get to New Birth because that's the soul of God exactly no words that just shall live by faith it's a walk but if any man draw back fall back draw back right God's drawing us up not backwards now to just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back unto Perdition right but of them that believe to the savings right of the Soul amen right to the saving of the Soul all right now I want to read I don't think we have it up here I think that's the last one let's turn to Corinthians I thought I'd have time to read it so I didn't put it in and then put it in the uh well in a minute the baptism scripture I got it real down somewhere you know man Romans six thank you Romans 6. now let's just read this is the baptism scripture you've heard it read by Brother Dale and myself and I believe this is truly what it is I want you to look I should read this Romans 6 1. what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound that's right how you going to get Grace on seeing them right God forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein right know you not that so many of us as we're baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death right therefore we are buried with him by baptism into Christ was raised up from the dead when we put them in the we put them in the water we bring them back out all right as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness just a new life amen amen it's going to be a struggle there's not going to be a flower bed of these but it shouldn't be a newness of life you're going to feel um uh even from my own experience when I came out of the water I I just grabbed you and we hugged each other for you know I don't know how long it was but but it was just like there was a shell there everything that I had inside of me brother Chris was gone it was it it was in that water right and thank God they're building a bridge over that thing right now yeah I mean I love the baptize out there at that place I remember um brother Dan I was thinking about it the other day they cut that big old tree down where we baptized these what they done they're gonna put a new bridge there but they cut that tree down Brother Dean said he said I believe those angels and I believe they did they were sitting they were they sat on that tree yeah he said well you crazy well that's what I liked it to be crazy right they were sitting in that tree watching that baptism service amen Amber baptism service we did there was an angel sitting in that tree watching because it's a witness right you got a witness in heaven and earth right both both Heaven and Earth you got to be a witness but they shall walk in newness of life when I came out of the water it was just like honestly that uh there was nothing inside of me it was just empty amen and I was waiting for God to fill me up all right for if we have been planted together gotta plant them to see it grow right you gotta put seed in the ground floor to grow for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death which is going down then we shall also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him let the body of sin might be destroyed now Jesus didn't come up an old man right he came up in newness of life he had to change the body knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead it's free from sin amen can't accuse a dead man or nothing right now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him all right well that's a powerful scripture right if we be dead with Christ we believe what is belief Faith amen amen we have faith that we shall also live with him amen he said where I am there should you shall be also knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dies no more you don't have to go back and die again it doesn't have to get on the cross death have no more dominion over him he's done right he's finished that's what we got to believe in right for him that he died he died unto sin one time once amen but in that he liveth he liveth unto God likewise Rick and you also yourselves to be dead indeed into sin unto sin but allow them to God through Jesus Christ Our Lord let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body in other words rain means Dominion right right let it not have a dominion over your mortal body right amen are you going to have problems I I was the sickest I'd ever been in my mortal body after that but so what right big deal I'm fine now right but your body even like you know doing the things I did I believe there's a there's your body doesn't go through an instant change you know many of you I told that that I used to chew the back and I did it for years and dipped snuff until until the very night I came up here on Wednesday night brother Chris I huge never smoked much but a chewed and and dip tobacco for years 20 years I guess or more but when I came right here that night I gave it to God and he give it back to the devil amen because the next morning I didn't want no more you can't do that physically you can't do that right you can't do that God's got to do that but he knew that thing bothered me so bad that he got rid of it for me because I sure didn't I did not ask Don I said I didn't say God take away this this desire of the of the tobacco no in my heart I knew that I had been changed amen and and then he started to work from that from the inside and like I've told you many times that even in my born-again experience I used to I used to say bad words a lot of bad words many bad words totally bad bad words all the time and uh God just took that away from me tell you man I mean there was no desire of that was that one time I was talking on the phone to no friend and I started to say the word AWS and it was just like it looked like somebody punched me right here and if you get hit right here you don't want them to do is I blocked the breath out of them and I went and never said the word and the guy on the phone he said what happened to you I said oh don't worry you wouldn't understand but and that's the only time I've come close to that because there's something that stops me because in my mortal see let's not sin therefore rain it's going to be there but don't let it rain rain means to rule and have dominion yeah don't let something have dominion in your mortal body get rid of it that you should obey it in the lust thereof in other words you like it that's what a lot of people have Devils you know brother Brown said that man that that was going to kill him remember the man up in Alberta or somewhere was going to kill him come up on the platform the guy you know he cast The Demon out but if you'll realize later on brother random said that man somebody asked him about that man I said oh he's in the same shape he wasn't right why he loved that devil he petted it and let that devil come right back right and that's a lot of our problems right right we get these Devils cast off by the word of God and you know what we we Pat them back yeah come on back you want scripture for that yeah let me give you scripture for it what about if a man if the unclean Spirit goes out of a man he walks in dry places right she can rest and findeth none right he comes back finds the vessel swept and garnished in other words stuff got rid of but he comes back and you don't close the door he'll walk right back in and bring seven of his buddies right a lot worse than what you were before because he'll make you a religious person then yeah neither yield ye your members as instruments of but yield yourself brother Brown safety stands you give money away he said do the vice versa right well if you got a problem with women look up I'm like when I told Richard Marlo he had a problem with that I know he don't mind me coming and he and I said something from the pulpit one day and he said it really helped him because we all have a problem with that women are the most beautiful people in the world now even even a 10 year old beautiful you have to watch these things right do you know what goes through my mind death yeah that is death right don't touch it right that is death leave it alone I don't care how pretty how enticing how beautiful that's death right right don't touch it is death it will kill you so when I say that then it kind of just it kind of backs that Spirit off a little bit because you know as well as I do the difference in us being a a sinner and being a Christian is when we were a sinner we invited that feeling in right we invited all that to come into our life we invited the it didn't matter if we picked up the cigarette it didn't matter if we I mean it was just second nature to go buy skull and buy red man it just wasn't I mean just like me and you going to buy a milk and bread yeah why Coastal Spirits were connected but once that unclean Spirit was driven out right you did you knew that was that was a hot wire don't touch that thing anymore all right Polaris there is works and faith has got to go together go back to what we're talking about with James your your faith in your works if you got faith in something but you still do it I don't have doubt you got faith right right I'm sorry see if I were if I were to tell you that that I cussed all the time and I still have problems with it come on people that's not a part of me right that's dead that's what he said there's got to be a it's got to be dead amen all right right not divorced right not suppressed right dead where it may come here but it doesn't come here you can't help the pretty women here but you used to yield to that yeah it wasn't death it was enticing oh yeah reading Tyson's spirits you'll get a lot of goodness good out of that neither yield yourself yield you your members and as if as instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin but yield yourself unto God as those that are alive from the dead right and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God for sin shall not have dominion over you now that's a pretty powerful script right percent shall not have dominion over you for you are not under the law but under grace amen all that Paul said about the law now look we're under the law sold under the law sold and sin but now if sin has no more demand you're not under the law but under grace gracious took over and covered the law that's right all right What then shall we sin because we are not unlawed but under grace God forbid right let's don't go over on one side with its name all right that's what he's saying right God forbid in other words he's saying you know what he's doing he's picking the holy spirit is picking up the thoughts of the people he's going to read this yeah that's what I'm saying Paul upon his tab to all the Christians he's writing it to the Romans he said What then shall we sin because we are not on the law but under grace the Holy Spirit would know that we'd be going really and then you say God forbid and you shake yourself and say okay God forbid I'm not going to think that anymore know you not that to whom you yield yourself servants to obey his servants ye are to whom you obey deserve sin then you're what sinner weather of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness but God be thanked that you were the servant you were the Servants of sin but you have obeyed from the heart right that form of Doctrine which was delivered you by some preacher by somebody witnessing to you the life has to come through the body but thanks be to God that you are the servant that ye were the Servants of sin right but you have obeyed from the heart that form of Doctrine which was delivered you being then made free from sin you became the Servants of righteousness I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh he knew we were human for as ye have yielded your member service uncleanness into iniquity unto iniquity even so now yields remember to righteousness under Holiness we used to waste our time and iniquity we used to waste our time doing things wrong now let's turn our time to God for when you were the servant of sin you were free from righteousness because you were serving sin right right what fruit had ye then in those things where are you are now ashamed right let me read that again what fruit had you been in those things whereof you are now a shame right for the end of those things is death right but now being made free from sin and become servants to God you have your fruit unto a holy man and the end the everlasting life for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord right you love the Lord amen amen and we ought to love him more Glory more we're going to love him more we are loving more because the wages of sin is death what is Wages payment right the payment of sin is death we're dying mortally anyway people we're trying to stop the death it Reigns in our members right in our inside person yeah but the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life amen through Jesus Christ Our Lord if you're a new Christian or if you're if you think that that you're in a in a Justified condition thank God Amen he thought enough he called you first right Glory yeah he called you amen but now if he called and he probably and I'm like that God called because the Bible says many are called right right um men are called if you're chosen right God probably called a lot of people and Noah's time right God probably called we think see we we thank brother Chris that we just say well God just asked Abraham no Abraham was the only one that accepted what God said exactly right right because God's got God's not a respecter of persons so there's no way God could say well I'm going to choose Abraham because he's so good and I want you to know he can't do that right so he called many are called he called out and Abraham responded yeah when Abraham responded God said that's my man right that's what I'm going to use right same way with you when God called you if he called you and you go through to a Christian Life that he called you for a life of service right doesn't matter if you sit on the Pew and pay your time we need it all right right we don't need it God don't need it but you know to produce our all right the things keep the light bill and stuff and things on we have to do things like today but if God chose you and you accept it Brother Gary that's the Almighty the one that said let there be and and go stand outside and look up at the stars hope the same person that said that the same person that just said let there be any just all these and we're trying to we're trying to keep this one world going straight and he just he's got the whole universe just working yeah right because when he said something it's Eternal right and it just they can send them to Mars and like brother Quinn said or whoever he was said stupid this thing they ever done went to you know putting spaceships on other planets God's got all that working yeah but he made all that just for me and you all right that's right he made all that just so he could bring somebody down here and say Abraham get up and walk right right that's right Noah believe my message it's going to rain because see nobody knows they believe it was going to rain because the Bible said that they couldn't find any any rain anywhere right the the ground the water came up from the ground the Miss from the grounds what watered everything no such thing as a cloud no such thing as rain that's why it was so weird David it wasn't just that it rained every day or they had a monsoon season it never rained right right for 120 years a man stood and preached to a civilization more advanced than ours because the Bible said as it was in the days of Noah so shall be in the days of the son of man so they were just as advanced as we were right and he walks up and says it's gonna rain and it's going to destroy everything on the earth yeah you need to believe what I said and let's build this art eight people out of seven billion yeah if it's the same as it was then right eight people out of seven billion are the only ones that heard 120 years of preaching right 120 we think we preached a long time we've been here a long time what if brother if it's 120 years probably they'd only be about eight people ready to go right but for 120 years God preached threw up no it's going to rain it's gonna rain it's gonna rain you know what one day rain right right but Noah believes what God told him there was his faith in what God Said then his Works was he built an art now what if Noah was to say God I believe you I'll start on that Ark tomorrow God I believe you I'm starting that art tomorrow God I believe he's almost strong at ARK tomorrow I'm gonna take a vacation and I'll start after I get back off vacation right no Noah believe what he said right and he didn't have a Bible he didn't have a prophet he didn't have a church age book or a syllable in other words he didn't have anything external like we do we've got all this stuff at our disposal he didn't have nothing but just Faith he just believed I think that's what we need to get back to like Keith was saying have faith have faith and believe what God's already said about us right everything's open to us now it's done it's finished the Ministries are all history there's no Mysteries listen I I promise you if you just listen and let God talk to you let God talk to you through somebody and have faith right then he'll answer I just believe amen he'll answer everything that we ask for understand he'll answer it all those people downstairs you know they're right here actually you know that don't you yeah right you're right here on top of them but right here is close to the pulpit as we can get them downstairs in my Sunday school class right here is where those people's names are right right here around this around this Pulpit are people right children Lord have mercy where's Tyler all right you see that hey man that's right that was a little boy named Tyler Herron bunch of years ago buddy you've grown up since then hey man little Zack Matt Krista Josh Hannah Megan George penungway right all the ones that we still pray for the word of God's going out all over all of us some of these I don't know or I call her name Brother Richard and and Aaron's mom and dad uh sister Krista Katie 19 now Ryan and you know this girl right here should have been dead that's right this girl should have been dead this was twin sister girl how was she she was two years old and she's 19 now Golding that there but she was two women when they diagnosed okay well anyway almost almost 20 years this has been up here probably about 15 of those 20 I guess and you know what still going strong right don't tell me the words it worked there's a power in this in this whole world you'll be justified and by your words you'll be condemned glorious so we need to watch what we say but we need to say what God puts on our heart right now keep it inside say it guys push it on your heart to say something say it my children right my husband my wife my brother my sister that's why we got those names downstairs I go down there every Sunday morning now I don't physically read every one of them all but I just look at that board and I say man if those 80 people were to come back to the Lord now we would have to have two services or stack them up on top of each other yeah but you know why you say oh that's silly we're supposed not supposed to do that let's believe and then see what the works that's produced from the faith that we have right let's just see wait and see let's see in the red book hey Jade in the red book less worship God good morning Tina sizing ready for me please foreign it out we should have seen us a faith Builder but but when God's never done anything to me it's just been it's just been quiet it's been something that that God's done for me in my life and and most people don't even know a thing about it that's the way I like for God to deal when when brother uh billions was here remember he stood right here in front of this pulpit music there was no singing right people just came up and whispered their requests and now the old Bill Yachts would have shouted and screamed around the person but he just laid hands on this thing whatever your simple prayer was exactly and I believe prayers were answered right yes we don't we don't sure it builds our faith to do that but but like I told Susan what she needed I said we just don't want that no more you just don't want it no more I don't want it leave it put it out here put that thing out here don't you say look Satan I don't want I don't want him have nothing to do with that I don't want that because it's going to come all adversity and all this Gonna Come but you just put a distance between you and it just say hey would we read the scripture get away from it resist the devil and help me from you so resist means to do this when we were Sinners it was this right but as Christians we've got the power right right Powers the spoken word of God Amen amen born again or not even just Justified condition folks we've got power because God has chose you to do something to him he's Justified you I wanted to get that down in your mind God has absolutely took all that stuff out of your life right now he's not took it out of your life as far as that point forward but from that point back if you were a whoremonger you're not a whoremonger no more right amen beware sinner you're not a sinner anymore no more right oh I wish you could see that amen justification is not just some little simple baby step it's something God's done that that he's not going to do for about seven billion other people yeah because they're not going to accept it right right but you know what just as just as the same as they don't accept him we don't have to accept the devil right that's right we don't have to accept it Hannah told us years ago about her situation about being gay and all this stuff I said I'm not accepting that right I don't care what happens to her I'm not accepting that amen all right there's no accepting that there's not a place for that in me there's not a there's not a doubt in my mind that God's Gonna Savor that's right man not a doubt in my mind but all that other stuff I'm not worried about right but I don't go oh gee oh gosh well this net we got to start doing this not to get into rehab none he walks through our brains long enough amen amen that's right Say It Ain't So right man right you think so Glory Abraham said every day it ain't so exactly It Ain't So what was he saying am I getting old ain't so he was a southerner yeah he said it ain't something right whatever comes people right Say It Ain't So Right David the Devil comes and tells you say it ain't so right you're finished with that guy amen he can't accuse a dead man right I'm not the man I used to be what's that song I love that song I'm not the man I used to be right you know the guy goes home and he's both he's beating his wife and his kids or whatever you know they go running away from him and he walks in he just come from a prayer meeting he walks in uh you probably you know the song yeah because the camera he walks in the door and the kids were running and scaring his rifle runs off he said things are different right I don't do that anymore right because of Calvary I don't do that stuff bro and that's what you need to say because of Calvary because of what did God did for me I don't do right right I don't and and by God's grace I'm not going to do it right don't do them anymore right right because God saved me and killed me he made me a dead man if I'm dead you can't accuse me of nothing right in justification he killed that old man right crucified with Christ and we look to him right not to what man says Abraham said I'm going to have that kid and from here to here was just a journey right sister Teresa it's just a journey right Abraham had to take that Journey but at the end he said I'm gonna have that kid amen It Ain't So from here to here right same thing anything you've got I don't care what it is this week coming up you say it ain't so and I say with this child I'm gonna leave I'm gonna put this up here because here's his name I'm gonna put it right here It Ain't So It Ain't So that a three-year-old should have cancer that's right right it ain't so he did not ask for that right he's done no sin to get that right but Satan has decided and you know what he may decide to do that just so me and you can pray and get cast off exactly amen yes sir God's going to use that Pearl devil bless his arm he's going to use that devil to show that he's going to live in a group of people amen and they're going to say it ain't so that's right you love God It Ain't So Right all this stuff it just ain't so we're not going to take that anymore like Daddy said we need to we need to get rid of these Devils hanging around we need to get rid of all this stuff we should be free people we should have Liberty to serve God right praise God anyway we should all right right well the word that we've got here man we ought to be family father we pray Lord what was said tonight was um worthy Lord to be given to your bride because lord they're the
