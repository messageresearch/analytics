is winding down yes but yet we're looking forward to seeing you we served you for a long time we want to see you Lord that's the desire of all of our hearts to know the one who paid the price for each and every one of us let have your way now forgive us of our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and help us to walk in you come and speak to us the words you have to be said amen and lead us and guide us you promised it so we can believe it you said you sent your word and healed us so we believe it and we thank you the Lord also delivered us from destruction guide us now and keep us in Jesus name amen Revelations one the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to sh unto his servant things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw this it is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy now remember that's what it is isn't it am the Bible is a prophecy until it's fulfill right amen right all right there was a day you were lost a prophecy in the Bible said if you'd believe you'd be saved but the day you received it and it become a reality it was no longer a prophecy so we're in the end time of winding down of all the word so this is not just right the prophecy modern events made clear amen by the revealed word around us right blessed is he that read us and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written they in for the time is at hand what time time to understand right chapter 6:9 and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar The Souls of them remember what we were saying this morning not bodies not Spirits Souls of them that were slain their bodies were down in the grave for the word of God and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy and true does thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth so that is not the bride of Christ she does not cry for Revenge she cries for forgiveness all right and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their Brethren which should be killed as they were should be fulfilled field you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now we got up so far this morning in a a thought and I guess we'll call it part two because we been studying on the Book of Revelations I think this makes message number 45 we just put a s TI to it this morning for the viewers out for them to follow with us of the Soul because we read here in Revelation that it said The Souls of them right that were slain right for the word of God and for the testimony they held it's not bodies up there is Souls right but how real is a soul amen right what is a soul that was what our point was the soul is the real you amen that's right you think your body is real but your body can go to the grave and rotten out but that soul will never die until even as a sinner it has to be destroyed in the Lake of Fire after the white Throne judgment don't know what we read this morning don't fear a person that can kill the body but fear the one that can destroy the soul that's right and the body in hell right so then the Soul is the real you that's the part that God is dealing with trying to get us to a place to understand the real person so let's remember that also uh with this Bible in the case has been up here for a couple of years or something I guess laying here in a church they know nothing minut it is it anybody say here soone said well I don't know what to do with it just keep laying around but Jim B said he'd like to have it amen so all right so every who did belong to don't belong to no more we're going to give it to Tim Mo today as a wedding present remember that's what we to do we get somebody a Bible well that's where you need to start your marriage and if you're fussing like everything go both of you and just take the Bible and hold it yeah and it'll solve a lot of problems right so we we'll give that to Timbo as a wedding present and it's to be used now hard not just laid up all right okay but anyhow so we got into the point this morning of talking about that the prophet of God said the fifth seal showed a lot of things absolutely amen and he said one thing it disproved Soul sleeping and we went through that part that that it showed then that people think see when you die you're just gone you know have you ever heard anybody I'm honest now I'm not talking about in the message I'm talking about before you came in the message is you ever hear anybody that was really explaining Body Spirit and soul or whatever no because it was afraid of it they didn't know what to do right they didn't know how to put it together but see the soul is the real you amen we gave that scripture this morning the soul that sinth and shall die Ezekiel 18:4 said All Souls are mine right right so he created Every Soul that's ever been in the world Amen whether you're saved lost Whatever It Is God had to create that that's right all right we read in Genesis that it said God breathed into the nostrils of Adam and he became a living Soul all right amen a living Soul now forgive me it's either cough drop in mouth or shut mouth now this weather is one of the things this dry weather is killing me you pray for rain right rain because what it's it's raining okay not much okay praise the Lord the Lord because I mean I just lay down at night it's not just while I'm preaching I just lay down at night and it just dries up and it starts tightening up you know not that way just just I got to cough all right but we'll cough and preach so maybe my coughing be right my preaching might be wrong but we'll try to do the best we can then you just have to read MOS you remember what we talking about this morning they had that elephant now that could speak so you know listen to my call All right but now listen Church the serious matter of what or not what you are right to understand you say well do we need to understand well do we need water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ do we need the teaching of one God right do we need anything in the Bible amen so if we need one thing of it we need all of it and see to find out who you are the prophet of God said when the bride realizes who she is that's right and what she's doing here right M he said well let just realize and I'm bride right well it's like I told you one time people years ago used to say a lot of times I I don't know whether I'm born again or not but you know but I got to baptism of the Holy Ghost or something like that it just all confusing you know don't know where I'm bride or not but I got the new birth well if you got the new birth you got to be Bri amen right yes sir right amen see and to realize who we are and what part you are right come on don't you even never consider um even as I've tried to explain to you before dreams did you have a bad dream don't you ever consider what that Parts is doing that of your body righten and then you know in you and then uh something comes up and you you have a just stand talk you have a wrong thought come in your mind I I never was a person I I didn't I never did have a vulgar mouth as a sinner I didn't I never I never drank cuz I didn't want to and I didn't have a vulgar mouth well you know after I got saved I'd be talking to somebody and before I know that I had to stop to keep from saying a dirty word boy you are messed up I agree with you I think you are too amen so we're all in good shape we're all messed up but you don't nothing like that don't ever happen and I never drank never cared for it then see somebody take a drink and you said you know mouth Waters a little bit you got to swallow oh you're not you ain't never do nothing like that I me you you you don't have no wrong thoughts I mean everything's perfect and wonderful you know you don't never think wrong well what is the part of you that's doing that thinking that right why is it the prophet would say it's not wrong the thoughts you think but if you entertain those have become part of you Satan could tempt Jesus said now you can argue with him he said even with women sure now that don't go into all that garbage can talking about this morning where they talking about how wrong Jesus is and and he sinned no right sin is unbelief amen he was a human mortal y subject to that he had to eat eat he had to drink he had to live he had to sleep right right amen that's right right but why would he speak of the inward part of man as the soul why would David as we'll get to it a little bit cry out my soul thirst us after thee oh God why in the Old Testament was they a actually an offering had to be given in The Ransom of a soul right and see then we would say well the soul brother Dale is just the nature of the spirit that's incorrect show me a quote anywhere of brother around right he says the soul is the nature of the spirit when you say it's just the nature of the spirit you're just making it all just like a dog a cat of nature Y and you can be Anointed with a genuine Holy Spirit on your spirit every day of your life the prophet had and die and go to hell right so there's got to be more to the New Birth than just a a spirit coming living in me right yeah it's got to be the person amen right amen so we're talking about the person of God amen amen trying to relate back then as to seeing the soul as I said then there we we covered it this morning that it does away with soul sleeping right well if it does away with soul sleeping then the FI seal would be revealing what the soul really is right and how it is not there something gone when you die that it lives on somewhere see because it talks of these people here yes after they're killed on Earth they have a place we covered that this morning they have a Redemptive form that Israel is crying daily for his people they have a Redemptive form the name of Israel amen sure and they're given white robes yes not that they're worthy of them not that they ask for them right but because God blinded those people right Amen to where you and I could be saved right amen if he had blinded them they would have accepted and you and I wouldn't have salvation that's right but he knew we would want it he was gracious enough that's right but see the soul is real we read there the quotes from The Prophet where that those beyond the curtain I mean those under the Altar and he would call it the souls of the fifth seal Jew he said they have memory reason they have feelings they have well because they can talk they can reason right right so you're not just dead right right amen you live on somewhere amen only God can kill that Soul or annihilated to where it would come into nonexistence and that can't be done until the watch thr judgment that's right you for a sinner so no we're not even trying to make a Christian we've tried to cover the point that every every person in the world come from God right Satan can't give you a soul see that's what the trouble was with the two Soul they say God gave you a soul and Satan gave you a soul that's why they called it two Souls see and said what it is that you need to just destroy that old soul of Satan and said you don't need none that's cuz he always was eternal that's the doctrine that's a two Soul Doctrine well then how much if we thought about it and consider those thoughts in our mind but what about it folks what are we yes we're a higher form of animal yes yes but we ended up talking about that see the animal has a nature to it right he has a spirit part of him but he doesn't have a soul because that would have to be in the image of God because that's what he done in Genesis and your Prophet says even a sinner you want these quotes even a sinner he would call a sinner that his soul was he would call it Immortal you said but Immortal means Eternal but it evidently didn't to him right mhm he would use the words like that for even a sinner right you see folks we need a new birth right and the new birth is not in your body that's right it is not a spirit coming in your spirit it is the very person of God to come and live in your soul amen amen we then it be a soul right we'll get down to that in a little bit where the prophet of God said he sent back his soul on the day of Pentecost in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost I hope I brought the one where he says he said that Spirit he said that's the spirit of God he said but I'm talking about the soul that was given in our place that's right the real you yeah right what makes us religious and go to church and anointing on our spirit right and you even love God with your spirit but that soul is the real you right and that's what God is dealing with we'll get down to the quotes in a minute so we just try to start off here where we left off this morning on the prophet was saying let's go ahead with number 11 if we get the wrong numbers on these out while you forgive us cuz I had to put the more morning together with the evening instead of preaching the morning back over and then preaching the evening we try to get it in one okay here's where we kind of ended up talking this is the message called Faith 1961 813 paragraph 7 now the soul is that part of you who knows and understands your intelligence that's the difference you and the dog right the dog has a intelligence form about him but he has no soul to make him different the bird still builds its nest the same as it did 6,000 years ago it has its own intelligence it's own do it but not the intelligence of a human right all right now watch where he Gres right straight to your intelligence you remember the dision I had not long ago so that was beyond the curtain of and we'll give them if we don't we have them for Wednesday brother R said the angel of the Lord referred to that is sold under the altar right when he was beond the C time it's not to Fe sealed you no uh it's a bride you remember the vision I had L long ago a little translation went into that place and saw those people now your spirit will come back to that body and that that kind of a body you'll see after a while when we get down to the theophany why it's called a body sure all right that kind of a body the soul which is a body that does not have to eat and so forth if this Earth the Tabernacle be dissolve we have one already waiting a Celestial body and with that spirit and that soul and Celestial body putting you back together you'll raise up again this natural body for that great Millennium amen now see then now we're getting the understanding of what will even take place in the resurrection and change and things but remember it's coming from what our thoughts were on the fifth seal that it removes Soul sleeping right am cuz they're not asleep right right they're alive and well doing they're real the bride is not a soul sleeping form right brother R seen them felt them talk to them just beyond the curtain of time right so now watch as we try to move on a little bit go go ahead to number eight let me excuse me number 12 I'll get it right a minute I look back to this place got wrong one all right paragraph 443 444 or 445 on up to 450 of the filth seal the fith seal has opened CC many other things open their C any other things have you C it yeah it was more than just learning of a right right of people that would be the the Israel of God what I've asked you to read the book sit down and just read that book and read the seal book and then just read it over again and see what it's talking to you not what it's talking about somebody else right but what is it talking to you yes all I'm waiting for questions here now where was the ark the slain the wound and bleeding blood for atonement are these oldest PR notice the Bible says if deser the Tabernacle of our dwelling be disolved we have one already waiting that's where I seen those Saints now he goes from the fifth seal in one paragraph see the still people right down into the Saints and showing it's showing you the same right it's showing you those people that's real right right they're not up there Earth we used to think you know playing on Hearts you know he said they're real right right these musicians have it on us all in them Hearts he explains a woman having a baby and her desires and how she becomes kind and sweet and all right before the baby come why but did you notice around that mother seems to be a sweet feeling what is it it's a little spiritual body Y come on spiritual life is waiting to come into that little body as soon as it's born now see before it's born what it's only begotten right but when it's born it's born the spiritual body unites with the natural body right and that something you think the doctors can explain to you yeah you go into your doctor next time you get there and say doct I want you to explain to me the difference in Body Spirit and soul he said I'll explain it to you we bring a straight jacket in here in a minute we'll let them guys that know it all about it talk to you you know what I'm saying is true that's right so then around the mother is a sweet little presence why now I remember Joy though telling Danny to get out of the room cuz she was hurt that does nothing mean sisters that just caus you lay there hurting that that sweet's presence wouldn't there right it was there right come on your Prophet said it was so if you're mad at a hornet they still there right cuz he didn't explain that was only Christian women so then a woman of the world is going to be screaming and cussing and raising can that still don't change the thing but that sweet little presence what is it that soul is fixing to come into that body right right cuz all souls are mine remember God created the soul Satan can't do it right right right so then what does he say and the Bible teaches that we are now begotten of God right we're begotten of the Holy spirit that is in that spirit that in US is Christ yes now he's caring you all the way to adoptions and that a Son of God being formed in us and when this Earthly body be dissolved this spiritual body comes from the bows of the earth there spiritual body that come comes from the bows of the earth there is another body waiting to receive it so he's explaining what you are from the natural you are Spirit spiritual condition that come from the vowels of the earth life all right but there's another body waiting to receive it if this Earthly Tabernacle is dropped there is another body to receive it this Mortal body puts on immortality this terrestrial puts on Celestial Paul explains it in the scripture that there are different bodies of things and he says there is a celestrial body and there's a terrestrial body right see the celestial body is a Heavenly terrestrial is a natural all right this Mortal puts on immortality this terrestrial puts on puts on cestal see see what I mean there is a natural body that's sinful but in its making just like it is another body that we go to and I am so grateful to God that I can say as your pastor and brother I've seen those people what about that pleasure then so help me in that body and handle them with my hands that's right right now what kind of a body is he speaking of he's just explaining the fifth seal this is just right down under the point where he was explaining that Soul sleeping is wrong now he's explaining the group of his people that he sees what and he calls them Souls under the altar M he not talking about your body there being beyond the curtain of time it's not your spirit it's your soul amen right he explains if you die your body goes to the Grave your spirit goes back to God who gave it but said your soul goes under the altar we'll read in a minute that even when Jesus went to hell it was his soul that went to hell amen that's right his theop the prophet says now we know that the story continues on for us here but to those on the internet I'm trying to make it hard to the newer ones a lot of you know where I'll be going to with it that your soul is your theophany right you know that God I've been teaching that for 40 years but to those who haven't heard the story I'm trying to approach it from a way that you'll see the soul of Jesus Christ amen and that these so under the altar that he saw are real and that that F seal you is the real people the soul and that's what you are you're not just a glob you're not just a you know right brother R said it was beautiful women all about 18 year 20 years old Y and uh you going to have to argue with him he said men with shoulder L shoulder L right but we don't have it here cuz we teach against it right now right but when we get there it will be no problem you'll be able to tell the difference between the men and the women now listen so what is it I seen those people he said and he seen them as real people yep that's right yet your body's in the grave your spirit is going back to God now look at the next one Christ is revealed in his own word 12 a and the main point I want want you to get out of that is coming on down here to the bottom because you can read all of it you got eternal life and it's the only life there is in Heavenly places recognize it he's in you in he was in him in gene form but come on down to the the Life part that's what I want you to see uh you can be anointed out here in this spirit and desire and do all these other things but when it comes to the ti poost of that word you'll never move from there you'll whole right steady and true to God as it can be outside of that regardless of what you do you're lost you're lost if you don't value that word right you said I don't care what you do because the word see is the only thing that's going to tell you what you are right you can be anointed let's see this in this message paragraph 29 you can be anointed on your spirit that's right but that is not your soul that's being dealt with right amen if I had time I did years ago and took it down through I believe that when you're repent of your sins and you come to justification that's the work of the Holy Spirit I believe that that's right I believe that's what the prophet taught and that anointing of God will come into your presence and be there with you because it says that the goodness of God leadth the to repentance amen then when you come to sanctification see there's the danger cuz when you come to sanctification you get all cleansed out and set aside and that anointing can come to you to your spirit and anoint you to do great things and you wind up to be anointed ones but the soul still be lost right right it's got to go back to the word you see what he goes on down here and let's see who he is that lady you're in church a naked blind miserable and don't even know it see anointed Anointed with the real Spirit see that Holy Spirit can fall upon a man in his Spirit y so the new birth is not just a spirit coming down upon you no that's right there it's the soul of God coming to live in you which is a person said but his soul is his germ the Holy Spirit can fall upon a man in his Spirit but his soul is his germ that germ is the word right now if we ain't never the word we we're in bad shape I don't care how much you can preach how well you can do this how much you love that's one of the inlets to the spirit you can't love without with your body y you love with your spirit that's one of the Endless and you you can love and even love God and still not be right you can cast out devils and preach and do these things still not be right Jesus said so said many would come in that day he said that settles it all right now look what we are so listen let him ask the question look at the next one number 13 from the message the word became flesh and India trip report paragraph 188 1954 10:03 the morning service we are a three-fold being soul body Spirit we know that what this flesh is we realize that it's here we know what the spirit is it controls the flesh but what is the soul but what is the soul the nature of the spirit see that's 54 now he'll say the same thing in 63 in just a moment when a man is converted it doesn't mean that here is a good deep teaching I hope you'll get it someday I'm going to tell you some boys another day he goes on down to explain what the new birth is but I'm W to get to us to see what the soul is look at 14 the psalmist David said my soul thirst is for thee are the Living God When shall I come and appear before God David knew he said Thy word y have I hid in my heart soul being heart is a word for soul right that's why it said out of the heart proceedeth all things out of the Soul not a thumping gizard or the heart it's your soul you're being it's what you are that's why the scripture covers it look at the next one I want to read a lot of these this afternoon to get out of the way E15 of the thirsting for life 58601 you know my soul thirst for thee if your soul is what if your soul is what directs you it's what makes you what you are a conversion is a soul is the nature of the spirit and when a man is converted he doesn't get another Spirit watch it he gets a spirit change now that's exactly scriptural give you a new heart and a new spirit right that's that's not the Holy Spirit right come on you give a new heart a new spirit then he said I put my spirit within you all right right he doesn't get another Spirit he gets he gets a spirit change and a conversion means to change his thinking change his way of living and so forth so my soul thirst for thee your soul is what makes The Thirst right cuz that's the real part of you that Spirit can be anointed you shout and have a good time do all kind of things but down inside of there you know there something wrong thirsting for God what about it look at the next one the everpresent water from the rock Jesus was when he was here on Earth when he died his soul descended into hell now show me one scripture where it says he Spirit or the prophet say it's his soul that went to hell he preached to the spirits that were in prison the souls in prison they repented not the Longs suffering of the days of Noah his body went into the grave but before he died he commended his Spirit into the hands of God his Spirit went to God his soul went to hell and his body went to grave to the grave and Jesus was B out from Resurrection because the scripture said he three things until the scripture could be fulfilled he could not come back because he had to St in the grave for three days and nights but when the spirit was all fulfilled this bar was taken away his Spirit descended to his soul and his soul to his body and he rose again how much more simpler could it ever be right go ahead with the next one which is Exodus 30 and2 and th take us the sum of the children of Israel after their manner then shall they give Every Man a ransom for his Soul unto the Lord yep everybody was taken numbered and then they gave a ransom that didn't save them that was a commandment right right to bring him you know to that point all right look at John Jesus said now is my soul troubled what shall I say father save me from this hour but this CA came un to this hour now is my soul troubled he knew he was going to die now it's like I've always said you can shout all you want to I'm 1,00% in favor of shouting I do my own in my own ways a lot of times down in the woods listening to a table but now listen you can shout all you want to but when they pull that gun out and stick it to that head you're going to find out real quick whether that person is in the spirit of God or is it just them that's right right amen because they going to face death in a split second right yeah right see the real you down inside of there brother around explaining about the lady that was dying then preacher remembered lied to her and kept giving her highst to knock her out you kept saying you preacher you lie he said her real Soul come up before her and she seen she was lost even though she used to teach Sunday school she used to do all kind of things he said when that starts breaking away in your body right he said you'll come to the real you right well I'd rather find it out now and find my real me and do something about it you listen Jesus even said my soul is troubled look at the next one Psalms 34:22 the Lord redeemeth the soul of his servants and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate God is trying to redeem the soul he's not trying to redeem your body he paid the price that'll be in the resurrection and the change Etc he's trying to redeem your soul he gave his soul right did wasn't just a spirit hanging on a cross right there was a man hanging there there was a very man he was God himself amen amen that was the soul of almighty God look at look at 19 souls in prison now watch him when he gets here and he'll say the nature of the spirit 63 54 he was a prophet amen paragraph 36 the soul of man is not the body of man it's the soul and the soul is something that's the nature of the spirit this same thing he said in 54 and then when the nature of a man like he said we are dead the scripture plainly tells us that we are dead and our lives are HID in God through Christ seal there by the holy spirit that wasn't that your body died it wasn't your spirit died it was the nature of your spirit amen died see the nature which is the soul yep see you two Soul people just saying the souls the nature of the spirit I quoted this quote to a man in Jeffersonville Indiana that was standing outside um the uh where they used to make the books Armory Armory and he kind of sniggered because this is what I quoted look at what brother R says the nature which is the soul the nature of your soul is God amenn if you're born you're born again amen he said because they always taught your soul was just a nature he said how can a nature have a nature I said argue with your Prophet I'm just telling you what he said but look how more beautiful could it be the nature of your soul is God if you're born again if it's not it's of the world the nature of your soul is God if you're born again if not the nature of your soul is the world right that's right is that plain sense yes anything to begin has to end so therefore the only way that you can have eternal life is to have a life that never did begin and then your life did begin when you were born when God breathed the breath of life into your nostril and you became a living Soul then you begin then look the next one I got 44 souls in prison but that Soul that's in there see that soul is what God is working on Now read that over and over and over don't get on down here and read the rest of this we'll read that read that statement over and over and over right and you'll see the Plan of Redemption that's right the soul is what God is working on that's right amen not working on your body what ises a preacher preach you quit this you quit that you get out of this you don't do that no more you can get saved Now where's the Bible for right he's not working on your body don't you believe in living good brother help no boy they cut that all now they'll be in a hurry bad one no I believe in being born again and when you're born again it'll take care of everything right don't you think you ought to live right no just get born again and let him live is that hard to understand and I know what the brain does and I said you don't believe in being good no you don't hear another word is say right it just cuts off I can't help that watch what he says now that soul is what God is working on right now reads your Prophet beautiful beautiful see if he can only get that nature that Spirit he didn't bother him to say Spirit soul and nature to agree with him then that nature dies the nature of the and the love of the world dies not your soul died he explained it the nature and love of the world right is what dies and the things that the world is of the world is dead if you love the world things of the world love of God is not in you and a man must be born again so this Nature has to die and the nature of God comes and lives in you right God is the only thing that never did begin and Never End Amen don't what he working on brother why is it you don't preach on high and dress and clothes all the time because I know that not going to get anybody saved that's right right well I've seen a lot of people cry come to the altar because that they beat them over the head about the way they live you want to argue you with me cuz you remember that person that came to the altar that night went back out and it didn't make him a Christian that's right come on you know the people you're talking about in your mind you know who you got in your mind that wept to the alar because somebody beat him over the head about cutting her hair painting their face y you know it didn't convert no right that's right wasn't long until they went back back to what this doing or even worse right amen that's why people don't want me around I get down where you live at amen and just let you answer the question we used to have a man in the Baptist Church every time we had a Revival he come do and got saved I'm not kidding you not throwing off on him either I finally heard he came got it one time thank God I'm talking about two revivals a year he got saved twice a year and he stand there and cry and pray and weep and say I'm saved and I'll never miss church again didn't make it till the next week I'm not joking you now he never made it till the next week why brother Rand said you pleading I mean you talk to people you you get them in the altar right and you said you got a two-fold child of hell because you can't get them to come to God then cuz you done beat him to death about it show me where Jesus preached about hair and dress and clothes it's all I want can we solve the problem now right show me where Jesus every serve his preach that way show me where brother randam preached that way and brother brandham was even preaching to the World on tape and he knew it you remember his first sermon that he preached about hell and there was no God there no mama there no Daddy there and old Dr Davis said what where sermon ever heard in my life he said but they was crying and weeping he said do at weddings and funerals yeah he said children are born by the word now he knew what he was talking about you don't think we let people come around here for about two weeks they'll find out what you look like and when they ask you you can tell them why you don't cut your heart and I get to preach all right okay if he can get that nature of that Spirit to agree with him you'll die he's working on the real you that's number 20 pull up number 21 continual reading is what it is he never left his body see corruption neither did he leave his soul in Hell raised him up on the third day and he's alive forever more and we will have a body like his own glorious body that's why we're baptized in his name that we might come forth in his name in his death in his resurrection then we Rise Again testifying to the world that we have new life that the old man is Dead We buried that first nature what was the nature of your soul that we were reading our just a moment ago same message the nature of the soul is of the world when if it's born again it's of God right so he said what you buried that whole nature all right that old man is Dead We buried that first nature see that first nature is gone and then we are the nature of him see it wasn't your soul that died it wasn't your spirit that died it wasn't your body that died when you got born again it was the nature of that Soul yes which was of the world it died right then the nature of God comes in by the new birth into the soul listen he lives in us and we don't do our own will we do his will we don't think our own thoughts listen the mind the mind is what thinks the mind that was in Christ Jesus is an every believer that's right now that ain't a head transplant that's not knowledge right his mind was his soul right listen the mind that was in Christ Jesus has never been see there there is the soul Y what Paul said let the mind that was in Christ Jesus be in you to do what make you a new creature or creation right so God had to release that life that could have come back in you and I to give us a new birth and that's what we're speaking of now that's the part that I'm thinking of now that that's within us the soul that's what God come to die for and to do that he is to get his own soul now those Old Testament people could be Anointed with the spirit right right m you can talk about the nature of God you see that soul of God came to into being in Jesus Christ amen all right look the next the queen of sha bouncing back to 1960 e75 God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself Jesus said it's not me that doth these things things it's my father I the son can do nothing in my in himself but what he sees the father doing and then when God was with God was with us God above us God With Us in Christ Emmanuel God With Us and then when the blood cell was broke at Calvary and the blood was shed the spirit under the old dispensation sin was just covered not forgiven covered because the blood of goats and Bulls could not take away sin and only cover but when the the the life that was in the animal that died life could not come back upon back and be a spirit within the human being because it was animal life without a soul go everybody make sure see but when Jesus died listen it was a soul of God and when the cell was broke it Sanctified a church that the Holy Spirit could come to live in us who were zexual born then it's God above us God With Us now it's God in us what happened God came down in a body the fullness of the godhead bodily dwell in a man we call Jesus Christ and he gave his life if it is only the anointing of the spirit you need for a new birth brother R said the anointing left Jesus in the garden so you don't need him to die on the cross if all you need is a spiritual condition yeah right but what we need is the life of God God Amen right which is the soul of God right that's what we need we need God to come and live in us not just God With Us that's right but God to come and live in us that's right look at the next just give you the scripture First Corinthians 15:39 and All Flesh is not the same flesh but there's one kind of Flesh of men flesh of Beast another fish and birds they are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another one right okay just roll up quot right on another he Celestial body now what I'm going to be doing for a little bit is is making a point Celestial is theop cuz brother going to use them together right in the same quote listen to message called life 1957 let's close our eyes to imagination for a few moments and go way back in before there was before there was anything the great Fountain of all eternity with that Spirit of love joy that Spirit of honesty that Spirit of tress in this Perfection then out of the existence of the father went the logos which was the son which was the theophany which was the body of great Jehovah went forth in a Celestial body amen so a Celestial body is a theophan right theop is a Celestial body and you look it up in Webster theophany will give you basically the body of a deity right right but just remember a sinner as a Celestial form right for the soul and out of the exist then out of the existence the father went to Lo which was the son which was the theophany which was the body of the great Jehovah God went forth into in a Celestial body that's the logos word spoke out of them great Fountains of life and went there there was the theophany which was God made into word now you know what he's talking about and you begin to say Let There be right right the soul of almighty God came into existence as a word right now if you go study who is this mesic it will really help you right and that theophany was made flesh in the person of Jesus Christ amen that soul that Celestial being that God that's what said that God was in Christ reconciled in the world I don't like the way he talks in all of the fullness of the Trinity you got no problem using Trinity so long as you didn't believe there's three Gods with it dwell in him both Father Son and the Holy Spirit all in that and that's the way we go come back to the original beginning of God there we are born again not of Flesh born again not of blood but Born Again by the spirit and then an eternal spirit of love and honesty come down to make its place in us not on us right in us right and then when we die from this life we go into that body which if this Earthly T not going be dissolved we have the theop to go into a body Celestial so you use Celestial the ofing and just keep keep right on going all right couple more quotes will be through may have to have another cough drop but that's all right now let's drop back in 57 and read letage called inment here he goes where did he leave when he left they talk about Jesus right where did Jesus go when he left all right when preach to the souls and PR prison right he he ascended he went and preached to the souls that were in prison they repented not in the long suffering the days of Noah his soul his Spirit his theoy of his own being mhm amen went down word to Hell H let's follow him would you like to tonight to follow him a few minutes let's see where he went just below the regions of the Mortal being lays the realm of demon power below that just above that lays The Souls of unjust below it lays the very domain of Satan hell and just above us see that's going that way just above us lays the Holy Spirit then under the altar lays The Souls of the just men the next is God himself one going downward one going upward the two Spirits are here on the earth influencing the people people of this Earth is right here today one of the others influencing you right it's either an upward pull or a downward that's right amen if we're born again it's upward right if we're not born again you can't do nothing to be turn be pull downward right right right that's why you love the world and things of the world right all right look at the next one questions and answers on Hebrews 1957 here his body was in the grave and his soul was in Hell preaching alive Y what about that he was in his theophany again his soul was down there with those people that were in theop also Y and was witness to them that are that to them they repented not in the longsuffering Y he didn't have any problem calling the sinner soul is the offing just remember the difference is if you're born again right your soul is of God if not it's of the world just simply means a body you go to see a sinner's got a body he goes to when he dies he just don't go out nonexistence right his soul goes somewhere when brother Brandon went beyond the curtain of time you remember he turned and looked back and saw his body laying there but his soul was under the altar right with them we'll get to that more on Wednesday all right go to the next I got two more but after the days of his preaching mhm his ministry continued on look cuz the last group he preached to was the souls that were in hell that could not be forgiven I have clearly read that from the Bible here from second Peter say he went and preached to souls that were in prison which is Hell locked up until the day of judgment now in Peter it says the spirit it doesn't say the word soul in nether it says the spirit of them but now the word is interchangeable right right amen the brother R when it told us what it said he says the soul right no no he don't it's that Spirit Well you going to deny everything he says that's all right go ahead here's the light then we'll pick up we'll take up this Wednesday night this is the FI seal 433 443 excuse me paragraph the FI seal is open there SE many other things if you caught it see I'm waiting on my question to see by all right now where was The Arc we done read this this morning the slain wounded bleeding bloody lamb for atonement or those odorous priers notice the Bible said if this Earthly Tabernacle of our Dwelling Place be dissolved we have one already be waiting now that's still still Jew right but this next words is THS where I seen those Saints that's the bride of Christ right so the fifth sealed You Fifth sealed Jew when they get eternal life they can come back but they can't move until then but their soul is their being right of what they are remember death only changes your dwell place right it's all it changes right and we don't believe no place that we can go and and and you know kind of maybe have a hopes of being saved we have to depend on it now we don't qualify for foolish virgins we may be foolish but we may not be virgins if we don't believe God's word but laying down the thought and then we we'll come back on it Wednesday night Jesus's Soul was his theoy the person of his being amen your soul is your theophany the person of your being whether you're born again or not right it is the person of your being that's right but if you're born again your nature the prophet said your soul is of God right amen that's sensible isn't it he gave his own life his soul comes into you into your soul not into your body or your spirit right it's his own life that's right cuz you can be anointed on your spirit and not not be not be salvation well how do I know brother Dale what about right that's the only way you'll ever know shouting Indians the prophet says does that like Wade said last night talking about her this morning or sometime you there singing while ago yeah you go down there to Georgia ball game and they're shouting does that mean they're save no that means it need to be R cuz you go to the ball game and you don't go to sleep yeah you don't sit all puffed up right you get in the spirit don't you right okay that's enough if you don't know what I'm talking about out you lost anyway we can enjoy the things of life there's nothing wrong going to a ball game that I see right not unless it's that's what captivates you right now if that's what captivates you I think it is wrong that's right deer hunting if that's what captivates your tra but different people are made different ways and like different things that's true told you the only time I went down to the Braves ballpark I sitting there thinking man this would be a great place to have a Revival woo how many goes in there 100,000 or something what 45,000 45,000 45,000 people back in there amen and I thought this is a great place to have R you you can be excited in the right way right brother random said won you take your children down there to like a Disney World you see we was Tau taboo to go to Disney World when we was coming up into the message but I'm sorry that I found them quotes I guess I found out the prophet said won't you take your kids down there to go it out in California I think it was take your kids down there and they went Y and he went cuz that's where he seen the rat with the the stuff that they put on the smoke yeah but see people don't like you talk like that but I don't like it when all you got to do is I mean you know every weekend you got to go to the Ball Game there something wrong with you especially if you miss church to go to ball game and especially if you're too tired yeah when you go on Saturday to get to the church on Sunday now you got the wrong Spirit right amen and you need to get an an altar right see I Don't Preach dirty I Don't Preach against women in cars and clothes and dresses I preach against everything we do that is of the world eat too much think on these things let's stand what is your soul that you're being right where is the new birth is in your soul now where the very life of almighty God comes in and live not just a spiritual anointings but when they can put that gun to your head and say deny your savior and you say pull the trigger cuz I'm not going to do it I'm not shouting Glory Hallelujah but pull the trigger because you're going to put me into the arms of my savior right go down inside of me is something stronger than all other things you mean you're worried about all the things the Bible says there is no weapon formed no weapon form that can overcome you that's right amen God don't need a world full of people only need one to believe him the soul is the real you that's the part brother around said souls in priv that God is working on why would he call the title of the message Souls that are now not looking over somewhere else he was looking at mankind seeing the souls of mankind were already doomed and was not accepting Jesus Jesus Christ when he's looking at he called them Souls that are now in prison what about being bound so much until you're in prison what have we got let's try 61 in the red book 61 in the red book anybody have e then we're going to go through the sisters My Hope nothing than Jesus blood and I dare not TR hold on Jus on Christ that
