TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] holy [Music] holy [Music] holy [Music] amen and amen and amen just just keep looking you'll find him amen and good to see everybody in the house of the lord you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn to ii corinthians 5 and then we'll go to hebrews 10. ii corinthians 5 hebrews 10. remember brother bob is up i think with brother uh chris shane's preaching this weekend and brother luis is interpreting uh brother tony so they're both tied up today so let's keep them in your mind brother bob will be ministering to the lord willing this coming wednesday so we get all of those things on on on the right way uh let's see yeah i'd i'd ask you we were listening to a tape the other night and it really fits the parts that i'm trying to bring and if you would either read or listen to the prophet's message on who is this melchizedek you'll find the very wordings of things not necessarily that i picked them out of that message but uh you know you will find a lot of the things that we're talking about so uh you know do that and and and study that just a little bit all right uh let's see anything else we got uh we got the announcements about the the uh valentines for next week uh this coming saturday and we've got the all right yeah we're uh we're going to just ask you if you want to i know we're we're a little tight in the way we're trying to do uh in the services but we just ask you if you want to do you want to just have a vote on it and remove the the blue tape and that way you can spread a little bit more uh you know and not be so tight we still want to stay separated as much as possible and also to make sure and wear our mask you know in the services and the things here and while you're here at the church and all because that's taking care of us so just remember that i talked to brother altic this week he has uh the virus and he's doing better so just keep praying for him and to do it and many others are are doing it so uh remember that let's see there's something else i was going to try to remember i'll think of it when i get into the message but uh i lost some memory yesterday because i met head on with a 2x6 and it won uh you know so that was you know i shouldn't have been trying to to move it right where it was that but i tangled up in some twine that was on the ground and went head first into a two by six course you'd never notice it you know that's uh that's what you're to make sure that they told me said you make sure and tell them what happened you know we don't want nobody thinking over here beating me up you know but that's that'd be doing but just uh thank god that he did take care of him because it could have been worse or something would have been there you know the two by six was bad but if they'd have been nailed or something there the lord takes care of us in all that we're doing okay second corinthians 5 and then we'll go to hebrews did you aren't everybody in favor of removing the things to where we can spread out a little bit uh well okay that would be the majority of the people that way we can spread out a little bit a little better and have more seating capacity but just remember still don't pack up that's the point that we're driving at that we've been driving at is to uh have you to move a little further apart where it wouldn't be so much you're sitting for the time and we are talking about now uh on down a little bit further maybe we'll pick up the sunday school for the children and things you know and begin to get a few things back in but now we're not um oh yeah we're not ruling people with what they're trying to do in this if you want to go down in the basement you feel free to go and and watch it there you know and do the things and all of that now uh i was asked about this taking these shots and things for this virus i'm not going to tell you not to take it but i'm not going to tell you to take it i'm going to let you leave it up to yourself that's because that would be the point you say well i have to well then all right but i'm saying it this way we we have had plenty of viruses before that we had to take polio smallpox measles we've had to take those things i see nothing wrong if i did i would tell you i see nothing wrong with taking these shots but it's still left up to you to do that it may be mandatory in your job something that you're doing or whatever may be mandatory it may be mandatory for all of us before long all right then we we do what we've got to do we're just trying to get by while we're here and not be to well well you got to do this you got to do that well we don't think you've got faith because don't get into all of that don't don't get into those things you know talking about if somebody takes a shot they ain't got faith what did you take to polio did you take smallpox did you take any of those no just don't do that just just be what we are we are the body of christ and and we're praying and we pray to do now i do say for you to do one thing i've always said this now if you go to our house and we've got a medicine cabinet thing right as you start out the back door and you know what's in there are medicines and things but you know what's in that it's prayer claws stuck on the wall or laid in there of the the cabinets i i tell you to anytime you get a medication pray that god would sanctify that what's the problem why can't we do that ask him to turn it around um brother colleen's wife oh uh she had a thing years ago and and uh she's they took out her pituitary or how you pronounce it gland or whatever and you know and she got to getting sicker and so she asked me about it i said well let's just pray that god will turn that thing around and make it to where it'll be right well you know what we prayed in just a few days you know what they've done they took her off of the medication that was a medication she was told she would have to take the rest of her life because you got to have the gland to produce the uh insulins for the body some way all right but just keep those things in mind and and also you know that we'll do it okay uh anybody with any comment about it sister trudy and i feel fine today it's just sore right where they put yeah well it that's all right so we just you do whatever you you're led to do and don't worry about nobody else if somebody else don't take it that's fine if you want to take it that's fine because you just think about how many shots you've gotten that your children take that you don't want to take you know and i'll tell you that the doctor told me he said sam at your age and you've been in that hospital five days said there ain't no telling what they gave you said it may take a long time to get that out of your system well that's all you know they're trying they're practicing medicine but see you just don't know what's going on so we just trust god and thank him for being with us right okay all right father just be with us in your loving grace and all that we do here we've committed to you and believing that you'll take care of us now just open the word unto us this day that we may walk in the light of your grace forgive our sins and lead us be with this sick lord all among us there's many sicknesses many things that are happening but lord just be with each one we love you we thank you in jesus name amen okay second corinthians 5. we'll start reading about verse 16. wherefore henceforth know we know man after the flesh yea though we have known christ after the flesh yet none that yet now henceforth know we him no more what after the flesh we know him by the holy spirit we know him by the new birth therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away and behold all things are become new and all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and have given to us the ministry of reconciliation give it now on down to us to un to wit to understand that god was in christ what is the ministry of reconciliation that god was in christ right reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation all right now let's stop there and then we'll go to hebrews we're going to try to get to this today if we can hebrews 10 verse 1 for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with these sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there and too perfect for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshiper once purged should have had no more conscience of sin but in those sacrifices the in that old testament things and all and those sacrificed it couldn't take away couldn't make it right but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sin wherefore when you he cometh into the world now something's fixing to take place wherefore when he who jesus christ cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offering thy wood us not but a body has thou prepared me you may be seated the lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now we were trying in our last message to cover some things and review backwards and forth and we we continually do those things but i do i would ask you if you would if you just want something to see where we're going and what we're doing get the message of who is this melchizedek and just listen to it and you'll hear the very words that i use because that's where i got it from all right not saying necessarily go into a word for word thing but i do read a lot of quotes and i'm sorry today that about the quotes i i messed up and and left some of the homes from the notes so i didn't have time to rerun once i found out what was going on i didn't have time to rerun some of it so if you want to take the quotes and the things for today let me know i'll be glad to run them off and give them to you but some of you got them i know that all right but now think about what we're trying to do we're talking about the revealing of almighty god god made plain you know by the things that we see even the eternal godhead is made plain by what we see we see a human being we see a father a son a human a person to do it and and we can see those attributes and see that that it's in god and bringing it down to us that we can see those things you know all right and we'll do that and and we're trying to pick that up then the godhead made plain or clear to us we went through the before the foundation of the world the things of god coming into being you know and stepping forth and revealing himself to mankind then we brought it into adam and them and bringing it down and then our last couple of messages has centered coming down to jesus christ all right and as we read here in the scripture about he said a body thou has prepared all right now that's what i want you to think about today i want you to listen what the prophet is saying and think about how clear god is making himself known through the prophet's message all right and we can read it and study it and see that it's just clear and plain if we'll just believe it that way and accept it and and not worry about it and and we can uh you know try to uh cover the things like i said we covered before the foundation world then we come on up now we've kind of got over into the lord jesus christ god and knowing that the world as we read was would be reconciled by him all right because that would be the message he would bring redemption you know right way preaching on redemption you know the things and and all of that and these other brothers have been preaching on it good so i hope you you listen to the things but bringing forth the redemptive plan and seeing that it's coming down to you and me now all right we covered it coming into the lord jesus and in the things and now it's come to us we'll try to pick that up in the message more today all right but we covered how that god is making himself clear and plain i think he's not trying to hide it it's hidden from the wise and prudent but revealed to the bride of christ what even the eternal godhead can be made known unto us the scripture said by the things that we see so you go through what the providence says he said you're a father you're a son you're a human you're this you're that you've got many manifestations and all that but said it's all bringing it back to see the one person all right now today we're going to be dealing with the body of christ all right and dealing with that the body that was prepared or are fixed and we know that god created that body all right he created that body through the virgin birth and the things we can go through all of that and we know that fits in good and comes out and as it does we can see that the the things are and then seeing that he come to live in that body he prepared it he didn't create it like we we've spent a lot of time talking about that right we think about that he created a body he didn't necessarily create a body he brought it forth by the virgin birth see and brother the scripture would call it the only begotten he was the only one begotten that way right he was the only one with the virgin birth he was begotten whereas adam was created a full-grown man standing there jesus had to come as a baby to be begotten but it would provide a body okay now we'll get into these things as we're going along and he he said now these these tabernacles that you're building and things they're okay you know everybody want to build a tabernacle i want to do something he said that's fine but he said i don't dwell on that i don't dwell in buildings and houses made by man he said i do i dwell in a body see that was his purpose of wanting to do that not to set up in a building and let us come around and worship him you know back there or any time to try to get us to see who he is and what he's doing and he's revealing himself all right reconciling or redeeming the world to himself all right and as he's doing that it was necessary that he would come into the world the way he came i was saying a minute ago you know he wasn't created as we think of he was begotten he was brought into being by the newber or by birth we have to take a new birth to become parts of the body of christ all right but he was the almighty god we'll get back to some of this a little later and he was the according to the bible he was the fullness of the godhead bodily all right then you've got all the statements you want that brother branham i don't know how many you'd have but how many you want where he said all god was he poured into christ all christ he pours into the church and take her back to the garden of eden huh then he would say it in another way all god was he poured into christ all christ into the church the fullness we'll get back i've got those notes and the things then at the house ready for to bring forth the things and that's what i'm saying if you'll listen somewhere in those series if you'll go in the series where he was preaching at the tabernacle uh when uh marriage and divorce was preached it's about five messages he really brings in the understanding of the godhead and makes it real clear throughout those series there then he preaches marriage and divorce the greatest of all messages that he ever brought but the other was a background see we don't look at brother branham a lot of times what he's doing and i look at something and i said all right now what's the background see when he come forth to preach the seals he didn't just come into the tabernacle and say i'm gonna preach first seal no he preached what god in simplicity one true and living god brought it down through the ways and all through the bible up and down and then he preached the breach which would show what would stand between mankind and an almighty god would have to be the savior jesus christ see he lays a background a lot of time and if you'll notice his message especially in the series is where he's preaching in one place you'll see him do it he'll be he'll background so much until you're not getting a lot of the message over this way because he's backgrounding what he said back here but he knows if you don't get what he said then you won't get what he will say so he wants it to put it be put into that order all right now then thinking about it a body you realize what i'm trying to say we go through the godhead and the understanding and thinking but you see god is not perfect we've been through that right without father son holy ghost takes that to make god complete you're not complete without body spirit soul etc because you're an example so you can see the eternal godhead and what is eternal godhead father son and holy ghost can be seen or understood by the things that we live our lives and all of the happening and the grace the trees the things you know and we can see every bit of that all right then see doing that then we can follow it and and see what he's trying to do is make himself known because that was his purpose in the beginning was to make himself known to the one that he created all right see then we filed it up got into all the other things and all but yet he's still coming back in the end time to try to bring that back all right uh i'll say it like he said it when he talks about it watch this when he speaks of of the goodness of the godhead bodily you ever noticed him say this he said couldn't do it to david luther well god was there he was with them and given them a new birth he said couldn't do it in wesley he said couldn't do it in pentecost he said but it's now see now is the time to come forth of the understanding of all things to where we can follow that because what do you think it's going to do are we going to expect to go out of here in a change of the body one day when we just haphazardly float along this you know just oh we'll we're going to make it one day no we better be serious these things are just play parties that's going on now i've told you that to start with i see these viruses and things like that what's the virus got to do with salvation but see they will use those things eventually against us yes but it has nothing to do they're not trying to teach you a trinity in a virus when you go down take a shots you automatically get to trinity well that'd be something i don't want the trinity you know i certainly don't want no shot to get it but think about it see just think seriously about what we've tried to bring we went through the old the part of before the foundational world and bringing him down as to being the creation standing there in the world the great creator the almighty god the word that would create all things right and now we're coming into a point that he creates a body all right see bringing that body into existence to where he could dwell in it right you realize then that he was not complete until that body came into existence i have no problems with the brothers years ago preaching those river jordans and things if it had just held it to the right point if they just kept it on down to where that you can see and i have no trouble with the oneness people that that he's they believe that jesus was the the last immorphy of god i don't agree with that i believe the bride of jesus christ is the last and morph of god all right see then i'm i'm just this me and that's what i believe because i can stay with the word with it all right and see without a body god is not complete that's right all right he said well what do you need a body for he needed a body to display his attributes right adam came along and made a way through god making him a body to where that sin would would come into existence and that he would you know use that to where that he could bring forth his attributes all right so god is not complete without it being father son and holy ghost body spirit soul all right see then by being the body he needed a body to step into because he wanted to fellowship with his people he doesn't want to and now listen what i'm saying he didn't want in the old testament to set up on a on a platform you know and they come in and bow down oh god we love you and then and then turn around he didn't want that neither does he want to sit in any kind of building now that's right not something made by man we'll get to it at the license but don't i'll get to it later to worthy when it comes to the point see now is when he's getting his complete plan that's why i said he couldn't do it and luther couldn't do it wesley couldn't do it in pentecost now he can come forth in the fullness of the godhead bodily in the bride of jesus christ now don't worry about it don't think what a brother dale i just don't agree with that we'll just go ahead i've been preaching it for 50 years so don't worry about it i ain't going to change what i mean is by i believe 50 years ago that the bride would be the fullness of the godhead bodily because the prophet said it i still believe that if you don't believe it that's up to you see that's where the whole catch is we're looking for something else instead of looking to ourselves to see where god is dwelling within us he didn't want to sit back there and say oh children i love you he doesn't want to do that now he wants to live in his people he's not satisfied without being able to live in his people not to just live with his people with it's fine but that's not the whole point he wants to live in you and me because i'll give them to you when i get to our tutor i've got about either seven or eight times where he said the bride is the fullness of the godhead bodily well if you don't believe that that's up to you that's just telling you what i believe the prophet said and i can show it by what he said it ain't something a doctrinal thing you know well they got one quote well i don't care if i just got one quote i'm still happy with it because i believe the quote's right you know what i mean if i just got one to prove it with then how much do i need i don't mind putting it in plain language we should be able to accept the message of the hour today over basically when we come into the message because we were just studying it we were just looking at it we were trying to comprehend it and but now it's opening up yes it is we see are you worried about storms and and viruses and stuff like that uh you better be worried about some what somebody's teaching you an understanding of the godhead i don't mind putting it that way you better be scared you better check out what is being said to you by me by these brothers check out what they're saying why because we don't want to be deceived well i ain't going to be deceived i'm born again well i hope you finally get on to one thing you say well we couldn't do this couldn't do that i tried to prove a point to you back there adam was eternal life in his soul eve was eternal life in her soul the prophet said it you know what they fail they didn't die and go to hell no they fell from coming to where they should have come that's the thing sitting before you and me is to come to the position the situation to where we can walk right into the word and say thank you lord that bang hit my head i got up i said thank you lord well that's still alive at least i thought it was you know yeah i'm i'm happy about what god is doing and i was happy years ago about it and i'm more happy now because i'm beginning to see more light that's what we're looking for because that's what's going to change these bodies is a revealed word amen what else is it going to be you tell me what it is it's the revealed word yes it's going to change you and me but it's got to be to the basis you remember the other weakness right it's got to be to the basis when we get down to the basis of saying by stripes i'm healed by justification same case in baptism i'm saved we've got to make a statement a commitment and hold it at that with the mouth confession is made with a heart man that believes we've got to put that down into the right place and get it to where we can not be afraid if you're afraid then you you need something to comfort that's the only thing that i've said to you about the church now i ain't said a word about anybody that didn't come or don't but if you're willing to go out in this world and go to walmart every other day and go shopping and all that but you can't come to church now don't talk to me like that now i'm sorry i'm not trying to condemn you i think our first purpose in life should be one thing the serving of the lord jesus christ is our god and savior that should be the first thing in our lives the rest of it fits in there okay all right get it get on with it brother okay come on listen all right let's just read something because i want to let you read what your prophet says about the fact that god had to have a body to come and dwell in to make him complete to make him come into the way he wanted to come he loved coming down with adam and eve in the garden is that the way the prophet said he'd come down and talk to him children have you had a good time today he wanted to fellowship with him and even after sin entered the picture it didn't take away his desire to fellowship with his people he never condemned eve he never condemned adam come on i'm quoting very random he condemned the serpent he condemned the earth and things like that but not adam and eve why how could he condemn if they had eternal life in their souls right true amen if they had eternal life in their soul how could he condemn him because he's when he gave them eternal life he can't give you eternal life and condemn you sure he can tell you you're wrong he can tell you off he can he can you know he can hit us in the head with a two before he can do all them things but he still ain't going to turn you down huh because you're sealed in he said well then i'll just go out and live that proves you're not sealed in you say i'll just go live like you know i can just it don't matter what i do oh you're gonna get a weapon i'm talking about a child now i'm not talking about people that are sinners that are not born again i'm talking about the children of god's going when god's going to whip he chastens his children if he could turn around about correcting a child and say beat the child that won't die how much more should he be able to beat me and you and that's come up saying thank you lord i love you i'm glad you thought enough of me to put that there and let me come forth now just help me through the next one you know all right let's let's let's get started and read some go ahead with number one brothers will we'll read these and just because i want you to listen to what your prophet is saying and by all of these be able to at least believe that god dwelt on earth in a body yes the body wasn't just something thrown in half had it was perfect but yet because it was brought into being it was a temporal body so it had to be redeemed not redeemed because it was sinful no but because it was not eternal that's right all right see then he would need the redemption of part of the body to be able to come forth but not to the point to where that he's trying to uh well let's read listen there's only one way of provided by god he was god's word made manifest he was god's promise vindicated he was he was god in a flesh form the bible said that god was in christ that great jehovah that created heaven and earth was made manifest in a body the lord jesus christ and then that one man he could achieve all right there's something daughter down i don't know until he tried it though through moses he tried it through moses he tried it through jacob he tried it through joseph but they couldn't come forth but he come in the fullness of the god of the man christ he was the fullness of the godhead bodily see that can take what these couldn't do what moses couldn't do what this couldn't do what me and you couldn't do you say well i think i can handle it myself you in bad shape no i'd rather be a failure than try to think i'm doing it myself but listen he was the fullness of the godhead bodily where god could express himself and he said who can accuse me of sin sin is unbelief haven't done exactly what the scripture said i would do then who can condemn me and say where i failed in one way god's provided way listen church a body was brought into being a body was brought into being it was not eternal because it had a beginning you think about that you think about these words that we use a lot of times that the prophet says like that that that he was the fullness of the godhead bodily and things they can read the bible because the bible said it we read you a couple of quotes you can read the bible that says he's the fullness of the godhead bodily all right but what did we think about that as baptist methodist presbyterian pentecostals et cetera what do we think about it i don't see how that could be oh you say but i believe that then well what's our trouble now he didn't change but you say well i i think that he's he might be the second person or the third but he's not all of it well then where are you going where's your bible what are you talking about see you're listening to the devil's light and then you go to the people of this message and the preachers of this message are preaching a doctrinal issue just about that way that he wasn't god till the river jordan well you well brother dale you just said wanna go did you win the full there's a lot of difference in fullness and what it is what i'm saying that he's was not the fullness to the river jordan was he couldn't make manifest he couldn't die for your sins as a baby he couldn't pay the price as a child he couldn't do those things he had to wait till he come to that anointing came on him on the river jordan and when the anointing came on him then there he was the fullness of the godhead bodily he said well what was he for then he was god almighty in human flesh [Music] but he was not to that position that he wanted to be that anointing would come on and that's why they couldn't kill him the prophet said the anointing left him it had to leave him you couldn't kill him see that body was made for the purpose of death yes he said well you mean god died no god the eternal elohim self-existing all-knowing wise god didn't die but the body was capable and did die for our sins but while he was here in this world that was his tabernacle that was his tabernacle while he was dwelling here in this world now after his tabernacle was completely finished now we're his tabernacle is any problem with that we are now his tabernacle if not where is he at well he's over yonder now this dude no no no he's got to have it that's why when you read that scripture it says a body thou has prepared me we ain't going to get there with this but we're going to read where the prophet says that you are the body that god now dwells in are we going to believe it or are we going to just go watch what he says on this one go to the next one on the message called the paradox he said god was a paradox why because it's just impossible to be what what he wound up being how could how could how god could become man to die god life eternal life couldn't become god's natural life to die listen then to save man to bring them back to eternal life he couldn't come the eternal god couldn't step down and become just flesh you know i mean become just man he had to be able to condescend he came himself let me put where the prophet said it he said he never sent a son he came himself he stepped down into human flesh there was no way they could kill that human flesh till that anointing left that body then once it left they could kill the body why because he would be willingly giving it up all right so listen to what he's saying that was a paradox how that the great god that filled all space and all eternity could come down and be a man in order to die to save his own creation that enough let him read how god became one of his own creation to save because he created his own body jehovah the father dwelt in his fullness in jesus christ his son jesus was the body of god god was re represented in the tabernacle of the flesh of jesus christ and how that that one of that filled all space and all eternity become one man amen you see what i mean and that god could do that to die and all that was a paradox in itself how he could make himself that way in order to suffer death for the whole human race he had to exit the body you say well what happened to him he had to exit the body the god that stepped into the body as a baby right as a baby he stepped into a human body all right that one day that god had to exit that body to let that body pay the price that's right you say yeah but brother dale's brother branham we used the word son of god a lot amen we just read one or he called him the son of god but he don't call him god the son right he called him son of god because that's what he was god was in christ reconciling the world god came down and stepped into that human vessel all right see now i don't mind preaching it and letting you ask questions i don't mean to know say i know everything but i know one thing for sure when we get to glory you ain't going to see a father in a cloud and a puff into this or that or the other you're going to see the lord jesus christ standing there in the human body that he dwelt on earth in and he will never again leave that body [Music] there's no way to separate all we got to do is find out how we can come into the places of being his body here now because he needs a body did the prophet say it we gave it the other way where brought around said that god is not complete without you he's not complete without his offspring that's his children we were the offspring according to the book of acts you know when paul said you know the mars hill he said when i come along i found in the description i talked to the unknown god he said he's the one i want to talk to you about he said i want to tell you about him you ever thought about it now listen i'm going to say something never let me set this away before you won't forget it he's got to call you before you can come right now that's that scripture he's got to call you before you can come okay keep that in your mind and don't lose that point he's got to call you okay now you tell me that you walk up like paul and you walk up on mars hill and they got insignias to every kind of a god could be thought of and he looks over and he sees one and says to the unknown god he said they don't know nothing about him so i'll just use that i'll use that he didn't say god was sitting there he didn't say that was god he said i'm going to use their illustration and he preached jesus christ now you think about it somebody just walk up to you on the street somewhere that will talk to you about jesus christ well now in america we basically everybody's heard the name but what about a foreign country where they ain't even never heard of a name jesus and you're going to talk to them about jesus he ain't gonna do you no good if god ain't calling did you get it ain't gonna do you no good unless god's calling him first when he puts on your burden on your heart to you go talk to somebody you go because that means he's working on both ends he's calling he'll take care of but you just think about it you think about just walk down the street and here's a bunch of old drunks and kooks and everything in the world and he said i want to talk to you all about jesus christ you know what go ahead talk to me we don't know nothing about no jesus christ well you just pass on then but a runner said you know right real quick that the predestination is off so you just go on you get gone okay let's read some more watch the reading now here we go to a court trial roll it on up till we get to there where we save time there's no three or four gods there's only one god there is three attributes of god father son and holy ghost but there are not three gods that's heathen see there is only one god and that attributes god the father was in the wilderness as a pillar of fire old testament right all right god the son then god the father created the body which was god the son and lived in the son see god was in christ reconciling the world to himself what'd he do he created a body and now look jesus said i came from god and i returned to god after his death birth and resurrection he'll send it back think about it without a body god is not complete that's the way he chose it that's why he made it he designed it that way but he's got a body he had a body oh god was he poured into christ he had a body see then when you would be looking at him and see him as i said standing there in glory you're not going to see a father over here and a son over here under the holy ghost over here no you're going to see jesus but you're going to know who he is see you won't be wondering then whether a trinity's right or this is right or that's right you'll know that none of those things are right you're going to see him as he is the bible says he'll have a body like unto his glorious body all right so then that means if he's got an eternal body in the resurrection he went into eternity body spirit soul everything all right then here we got to go that way our body is going to be made eternal one day but remember it's his body listen to what i'm getting to and just remember there's no way no i know i make strong statements and you say well i don't know there's no way that god can operate amen without you he chose it that way he made the way yes you didn't you didn't make the choice you never sought god that's right it's god seeking you like i'm saying how did you walk up to a whole crowd of people if god don't come down in that crowd and quicken somebody's heart to lead them to him then it's going to go on off me but if he comes down and says brother mo you say lord give him that little tug i look i used to listen to him say that and lord there ain't no better way to say it just give them a little tug on their heart because that's going to lead you to the rest of it right but you understand i'm trying to get you to see how that there's a possibility maybe wrong words to use i'm sorry a possibility of the fact that god can make manifest himself in this world as the great eternal i am step down into human flesh manifest himself through all of those things and ways and coming forth and then come down to an end time to find his perfect way he wanted it right then he's happy about that what about me and you are we happy go ahead to number four the revelation of jesus christ the church age will the bible teaches that god was in christ the body was jesus now listen the body was jesus any problem well then what's the rest all right listen the body was jesus in him dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily nothing can be plainer than that mystery yes but actual truth it can't be plainer so if he wasn't three people then he can't be three now one god and this same god was made manifest a flesh a body a body that he could step into now remember he had to step into a body in the beginning because he wound up being the genesis 1 26 27 man that says let us make man in our own image and so man was created spiritual being right in the image of god now if that is true then you realize all we need to change this body we're going to be right where we put them would have been if this body can get changed we're going to be right where we should have been to start with amen right back to where we should have been to start with it's all possible by him stepping into a body to be able to release that life because there was no way to kill him when he was walking as almighty god to great jehovah et cetera there was no way to kill him don't you think the devil would have sure liked to have done it but there's no way but see then when he stepped into flesh satan says i got to change i'm going after that body well i like the way brother harris said it because he was dealing with anointing but i can just go into even in the natural but i mean he always had his way of saying things and he'd say that old devil he said he was dumb he said he ordered he ordered this went on somewhere else and not said nothing to the lord jesus he said because that way he just had one to fight he just had one christ to fight you remember him how he used to make that stuff he said by doing it he said there was 120 into first whack and then 3 000 outside the next next point now you've got all these christ all these jesuses that he's fighting against that he'd been better off to let it win but he didn't have sense enough he still thinks he can whip it i know what these guys do i i i never went through karates or nothing like that but see they say well oh you're never supposed to fight your mentor baloney that's the guy you're gonna try to whip because you can whip him you're greater than all the rest don't tell me stuff like that i used to tell brother harris and the brothers don't tell me that that you'd bow down to your mentor and not fight him [Music] that's the guy you're going after but listen a body you mean brother dale do you believe that god's got a body yeah yeah i believe he has a body i believe he has a place to dwell he dwells in that body and he dwelt in that body i'm going to read some more of these but we're going to get on over to the back of these where it comes to the body being you see he's never been without a body since he developed it in the garden however where you know jesus come forth as a natural baby that brought a body he's never been without a body since then as bad as we are he still loves it right does he still put up with us did you still hear a prayer sometimes even though we're a bunch of garbage you see he ain't looking at the garbage he's looking at what he's what he said he's going to do he said he's going to bring a body and that's the way he's doing but it's going to finalize in the bride we'll get to that later go ahead number five the darkest hour then jesus comes he's talking about the woman touching the lord jesus and verse are coming out she pulled from him virtue through that human body of his because he was just a man born of a woman but his father was god but in his body he was a man in his spirit he was god so god was in christ and the woman pulling that virtue believe it but are you listening born of a woman but his father was god in his body he was a man in his spirit he was god see a body a human body a 16 element body the difference between that the prophet has said in your body he said his body was virgin born he said yours is not because he was a body i believe he could have given blood transfusion right of course there would have been nobody in the world had that type of blood i'm honest i believe he was the blood of god i can't believe i can prove that if you've got about two or three hours with some notes and i believe i can prove that that was the blood of god from what your prophet had to say okay go ahead let's go to the next one let's get a few more this is from the fruit shreveport now listen god was in his tabernacle the the son of god we'll say well now how could he be god and be a son of god what are you you have the new birth then you're a son of god you're a child of god you're god in another form called a son same as he is what i'm trying to get you to see is his next message or two is to try to get you to see whatever deals with him is going to deal with you whatever it is for him to come to a place it's going to mean you're going to come to that place because we are the people remember couldn't do it in luther they didn't have enough word couldn't do it in wesley couldn't do it at zeus street pentecost you've got to have malachi 4. you've got to have luke 17 30 revelation 10 7 etc you got to have all of that to come to the bases where you can talk about fullness of the godhead bodily did you ever hear anybody i'm asking you honestly to say have you ever heard anybody outside of brother branham would preach the godhead in the bride i haven't i don't know goes where is he at all right listen the son of god which was jesus was the flesh of god the flesh of god he was where the holy spirit dwelt in flesh he was the flesh of god he was hungry he had to eat he had to do he had sleep he had he was a a human being well i always thought he was a son of god and made him some kind of a special type of a god or something well just get rid of them kind of ideas because that don't fit because that goes into trinitarianisms and things and that don't work listen what he's saying the son of god which was jesus was the flesh of god a tabernacle that god dwelt in here on the earth and now that was that was christ and god became came united see christ and god became united and that's the way god could be seen no man has seen the father at any time but the only begotten son has declared him see in other words god was in christ showing his act his attitude towards the people the and what he what he was what god was he was expressing himself through jesus his son see as he dwelt in him making jesus and god jesus being the tabernacle that god was dwelling in here on earth a body has thou prepared me god dwelt in jesus christ and that made the father and the son united together now and become the now notice now what was in christ was in was the fullness of the spirit the entire fullness of god god gave christ the spirit without measure please give it like to me and you you can we get it by measure see he was emmanuel can you i'm just serious here i've been thinking about these things for months and well many really for years trying to preach on one god can you just believe it that he was almighty god in human flesh he was the tabernacle he was the thing that he said buildings i don't want what is that in the psalms i think because there's two of them one of them's in hebrews i think there wasn't songs neither that or isaiah but but he he didn't want to dwell in temples made by man's hands he wanted to dwell in the people isn't that wonderful to think one day we'll be able to walk with him through the garden we'll be able to fellowship with him we'll be able to praise him in worship everything will be so perfect won't it be something let's get another one okay go ahead to number seven i guess now god gave christ the spirit without measure is that right the fullness of god was in christ he was god emmanuel he knows there's no doubt in our minds or the thing i said yesterday the whole ocean is full you know water like a spoonful out of it we know all that come on up let's save time but in christ was the fullness of god we have it by measure he had it without measure the bible says see without measure no way he's he's just limited unlimited he had the spirit of god and and he comes through he wanted to use his spirit that was in a man the corporal body called jesus which was his dwelling place the body is a tabernacle god was dwelling in a tabernacle he was pleased to dwell there the scripture says right god was pleased to dwell in that tabernacle what about when he said it about me and you now you may not believe this but i do i believe the day he gave you the new birth he said i'm pleased to dwell in ray gabriel nobody else might not be pleased for these days but i'm pleased well you know we got these problems with these troubles that don't have nothing to do with it because he made us a covenant in abraham of everything being unconditional well then i can just live like a devil and get by now just don't try it you're gonna wind up in trouble don't try it you're gonna wind up wishing you hadn't tried it so the best thing to do is just be yourself and just be what you are and just be happy you say yeah but what about this this thing here what about this what about this money what about all these things so what so what you're going to eat your money that was life and talking about it the other day but somebody there said what are you going to do when you need it you're going to take out one of them silver dollars or scrape off some silver and say that'll pay that much no you're going to give the whole silver dollar you know that'd be the only way you get to pay for anything but you see church we're not making light of nobody we're all just do we do our things but yet still we need to be all time thinking about what he wants done he wants to dwell in you oh brother al canardi used to tell me so brother dale i i woke up last night at three o'clock i said he said i just got up brow said you pray for me yeah i said lord wake him up two o'clock i wanted him to wake him up earlier where he could pray for me because i want somebody to pray for me and when i was laying up there in that hospital and everything you know for five days and thinking what in the world am i doing here and when am i going to get out well then the word would come through said everybody's praying for you around the world we got you on the internet here we got you there we got you on this we got you on that i said thank you lord thank you lord we'll we're gonna make it through well we made it see but do you understand what i'm trying to get at let me read a couple more because i know i ain't going to be able to get to it but i want you to think until maybe next sunday whatever i want you to think about what brother random is saying i believe that in his body was a man he was born of a woman just like us but his blood was not our blood you know from a woman it was of god his soul he was god you just think walking on the shores of galilee was almighty god in a human vessel but they could never touch him until that anointing left in me could not be touched well i happen to know where there's a quote says that the anointing is on the bride the fullness of the godhead bodily is in the bride i happen to know where those are at and i you know what i happen to believe we say well i believe this that and the other what the prophet said well why not believe all he said for just a minute now god tabernacled as i said he didn't want to sit back here in a building and you come in and worship him and do he didn't want you to run it up and down he wanted you just to be his children what about being a child of god what about being a child of almighty god a human being capable of being a child of god well we've got to remember he started off becoming a child of god he said but i don't understand how that you can say that he was god in flesh well i'd like you to explain how it could be any other way he was almighty god in human flesh and there was no way to touch him until that anointing left him i believe your prophet said it like this after the door of the gentile church is closed god will anoint a brighter church then and said he'll do what theologists or theologians have tried to do in 2000 years in other words he said but he's doing it now he's pouring in his self you say yeah we got the new birth yeah but there's a whole lot more to be poured in look at it statue of perfect man faith virtue knowledge temperatures go to brother reynolds said that's the man god wants to live in i've got the quotes laying right here that's the man god wants to live in is the stature of a perfect man well i just don't see how we can do it now the problem is is you're doubting what that god can do it don't doubt him just accept it you know accept him your children just accept the lord jesus christ as your savior just say lord help me come in and save me just save my soul lord i want to be i want to be right and see then he'll take care of a lot of things i believe that jesus is the son of god now i believe the prophet is right when he said god didn't send a second person he came himself so as a son of god he just came down that great eternal step right in that body is not that exactly what he done in the garden with adam he breathed into his nostrils the breath of eternal life blasphemous names and he became a son of god with eternal life that's why you couldn't kill him you couldn't kill adam he was a child of god we talk about that sarah he couldn't kill sarah why because she was in i mean in abraham well why can't you think that we was in him he can't do anything to be in you until he's through until he's through with us why are you worried about these things or no no concerned yeah because we're human right okay no problem concerned mainly concerned with the bases wondering what's going to take place but we're being told and set in the stages even to what that we've got the the woman in the white house your prophet saw that 50 years ago or something but it's finally come to pies well i don't have no problems with her i wouldn't shoot her i would have no problems with her i'd talk to her about the lord if i could you know but you understand see a body 2 000 years ago was produced by virgin birth god didn't send a son to dwell in a son that would make a son no he come and stepped into the body and that's why he's called the son of god because he stepped into the body he called the son of god because he was another person you're going back to trinitarianism he stepped into that body and god said i'm pleased to dwell hear you him i thought we was looking forward to those things i thought those were the things the prophet told us would be coming brother dale i just you just you've always done it you've always tried to make everything so far away i ain't never made nothing far away i've made it too close again i never tried to preach nothing far away and i preached in 1969 in athens georgia that the bride of jesus christ would be the son of man in the last days i can still produce those quotes because they're written in the front of my bible i wasn't telling nobody what i thought i was telling people what the prophet said right you know that he can't be a son he ever noticed this statement that wrote around said that god couldn't be a son without the son of man you don't that statement couldn't be a son without son of man that would make him a father you realize that he created me in you a new creation in the new birth not created us anything else but a new creation and a new birth makes you and us even all of us are children of god the son of man is the word made flesh the bride will be the word made flesh but do we believe it do we believe it can we accept it that we are the children of god can we accept as paul said in mars hill he said some of your poets and all this said that we are the offspring of god he said that's right he said that's what we are. and when they said to jesus he said something he says what are you doing you're killing me for what i said we're killing you because you're a man making yourself a god he said is that not what your word says you call them sons that know the word comes to and said all i've ever done is brought you the word right think on these things think about what god has made you and me it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we didn't have anything to do with it we didn't call ourselves we didn't guide ourselves it was him guiding us you say yeah but brother dale i cried i prayed i saw god yeah that was a natural that's all right i could do it but it was really him searching for you because the bible says the goodness of god leadeth us to repentance so if you want any repentance you've got to get the goodness of god the leading of god to you and i the drawing the pulling that's right come on musician what do we got jesus the flesh was a man inside of that man was an eternal god what is it in you like i've always tried to get you to see we talk about the tree of life being in the garden oh wonderful what a sin hadn't entered the picture we went to the tree of life and been made eternal halls through because our soul wasn't eternal i mean our souls are adam's souls eternal adam and eve but not us and see what do you think is taking place now you receive the new birth your soul is made eternal you're waiting the redemption of the body and he's working through the spirit realm of memory reason conscious affections et cetera through the stature of a perfect man faith virtue knowledge temperature through adoption through all of these things that the prophet has taught us but what we do is like a brother told me one day we were talking about statue of perfect man and adoption he said now if i cross it up which one he used but he said that that adoption is simple we said that statue of perfect man is deep i just walked away it's the same thing the stature of a perfect man is the message of adoption but yet he thought that answered the question no it just showed how far off we had missed it the seals is for the bringing these things into you and i there the opening of god's word all the way through what do we got brother go ahead let's stand let's sing that little section we're waving ministering this afternoon brother bob be ministering wednesday pray one for another [Music] and now i know he touched me and made me anybody have a need the altar's open how many of you remember sister dover used to saying that for the mighty name that was her [Music] of song touched me [Applause] and now i am no longer put a tug on my heart and that brought me to him [Music] now let me walk with him [Music] something happened and now i know he touched me at me we're gonna make some plans away ahead of time do you realize this coming fourth of july the fourth day of july is on sunday that's 50 years from the day we started this church in this building we were down at the house the week before but that was the first time that we met in the buildings right here you remember the car come down hit every one of our cars tore them all up total loss brother moles of mine that evening we came back some of us had to drive cripples because we've been beat up but we're still here serving the same god believing him seeing him make manifests [Music] and now i know he touched me father we thank you for today and your the time that you've allowed us to come together and fellowship we've tried to express a little thought lord is to try to direct us all into the line of understanding that one day you step down in a human body the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelled in a human man that man was virgin born that man wasn't just something that was picked out or [Music] sent some way it was the very god of glory that came itself to step down among us and just dwell with us forgive us of our many sins father and cover us cleanse us by your loving grace go with us as we go eat a natural meal bring us back together this afternoon for the word of the lord we love you and we thank you bless the people that are sick among us the different things lord just touch each one just got us all in our grace in jesus name you dismissed he touched me
