about verse 5 through 9 even when we were dead in sins hath quickened now this is coming down from the children of disobedience and the children of obedience and all that even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace you're saved all right now by grace you are saved now watch him as he continues his thought and has raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of His grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus for by grace are you saved through faith now he's added something to his thought right first he said you're saved by grace through faith I mean by grace then now he says through faith all right and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of works lest any man should boast you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word then we're gonna take a little call maybe deal with it for a few services I don't know exactly how many they can go ahead and title it just put the title to it I gave them my regular title but just put the title to it we'll just call it salvation we're gonna talk about salvation all right because that can cover a lot of good things and you know so we're gonna be dealing but what we're going to be talking about today is you're saved by grace through faith all right saved by grace through faith well I'm just saved by faith well that's good you know if your points right you got something but I like the way this Chris was like I said he he says there that you're you're you're saved by faith by grace you're saved all right then he says through faith now grace is the merit unmerited favor of God given to mankind so we know for sure t what it's speaking of okay see salvation grace you know it's on the basis of God's unmerited favor it's not something that you and I could in any way merit if it would it wouldn't be called grace all right so now you say well it's just it's you know you can get to your point of where your mind and you'll be dealing here so well it's just by faith but I like the way Paul declares in C it's my faith yes my revelation that's what we'll get to talk about okay but he says it's by grace are you saved through faith all right now salvation is of the Lord it's not your point my point our goodness or anything we can't do anything to merit salvation there's nothing we can do you go we'll we'll Road there I've been good all my life I have never done is there that's good that's commendable you make a good neighbor Alcoholics Anonymous would like to have you on their side but that's just about the best you can do out of it because you can't say well well I'm I'm saved because I didn't do this or I didn't do that now that would put it on some kind of works all right see that wouldn't be what it would be it's by grace are you saved through faith all right through is a journey in your faith that will bring that to us the a traveler journey because I've always told you I believe it we we talk about salvation but to me you know there's a lot to be done with salvation a lot to be said about it and I'm a firm believer in ever since I heard the prophets message and begin to understand a little bit of what he was talking about then I'm I'm a firm believer that we you know salvation is just not a fact you walking up shaking somebody's hand it's not just something you could do neither is it something you can qu could quote memorize or do anything like that right it's not on that basis it's a journey that you're taking alright we talked about see after we come into message begin to understand because we've come through bad dissin and I doubt if a lot of you Pentecostals even thought much about justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost until you heard of the prophet or heard him express it you were more or less in - I'm saved we've got tears we got that we're in the gift we got it I know I'm saved because I do this I don't do that it's always been based salvation is mankind bases that upon what you can do or don't do or because of something you didn't do or you did you the the thing has always been to her that is try to put something that we could how something to do with it all right but the Bible said it's a gift of God now if it's a gift then you don't merit you don't do anything to merit that gift if you do it's not a gift me I mean you come to my house and you you work for me and I give you I pay you that's paid because you work for it you've done something but for me just to walk up to you and say here I want to give you this mean now you're dealing with no things whatsoever and that's what I want to thought in our mind this morning to lay the foundation to where we can just keep thinking on these things that there's nothing we can do nothing whatsoever you said well there's only one thing you can do and that's belief the only thing you can do is accept Jesus Christ as your Savior all right but now the Prophet said like this what you accepted him but has he accepted you well you know we come to Baptists and we know when brother Branham was explaining that about you know the the Baptist man said to him said well all Abraham could do was believe you mean what else is there to it other than believing that's good but now what has God done Lee we'll get back to Abraham maybe in his doing Abraham went through it the journey of things that would type justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost he went through that so he had a journey Christianity is a journey salvation faith new birth whatever you wanna call it it's a journey it's not something you just walk up and there it is you know no it's a journey that you take okay ever born-again believer has to take that same journey no no no no no I I didn't do like that nothing you didn't do leap now you're putting it on something you thinking about salvation is based purely upon the grace of God faith is the journey through that that he supplies or does but it's a journey that's why I said it you say by grace all right through faith your journey that you take has to do with your faith or revelation our are dealing in your life well remember first off no and keep it at that that you're saved by grace grace is total unmerited favor all right see I can stand up here and say well I didn't drink I didn't do this I didn't do that I'm just as much a sinner as anybody else and so well I didn't do this brother dealer I didn't do that don't have anything to do with it you just just lost as anybody else is lost yeah but I didn't go out and do like other people I wasn't mean you know the problems are you'll think that you didn't do or did do and that made you where God would save you okay we're just talking me you say well I don't know no I believe I'm saved because I didn't never drink III didn't do this I didn't do that well now you're putting it on something you done so it's not of God me if there's anything that you and I could do then God died in vain that's what your prophet said all right now see if he died in vain then don't worry about it we just leave it at that see and believe that he did do it you say yeah but I didn't drink I didn't smoke I didn't you I didn't wonderful does that mean yours already saved oh no we're getting up no we get into all kind of things with it I'm just talking simple language to where the children can understand where we can all understand salvation you don't want me to be good brother Dale no I want you to get born again I don't take care of that we're a part of being good or not being good now being good is commendable children you ought to be good you ought to honor your parents you ought to honor this everything you're to be all of that right wonderful we agree with all of that and you're expected to do that but that won't save you so you've got to have your own experience of salvation it's not what Mama and Daddy believes it's not what they've done or didn't do or whatever you got to have that experience yourself and see then if when you putting it on the basis of that you're dealing then with why that it says it you're saved by grace no we're gonna drive this hard so you listen to it you saved by grace you're not just saved by faith and when we read the Prophet said you're saved by faith don't misunderstand what I just said you said what I I've got this revelation of the message so that means I'm safe now you're trying to do it in some other reason you're trying to put something up there that you don't need Dyer approached it the way I'm talking about it because that's what I believe grace is unmerited favor all right now nothing I could do or didn't do none of that would bring it to the basis of saving me the biggest problem is now I'm just serious about this matter it's to those that didn't do or this out of the other and you have any thoughts whatsoever about that being any form of your salvation just remember that's what's getting in your way remember those that are sin the most are the most out to ask for salvation I'm not justifying sin I'm not saying you need to go out and live like the devil now don't worry about it you are okay it doesn't matter if you try to be as good as you can and never do nothing wrong arrest all you lot that's still trying to work for the devil that's trying to work out something but I've got a but but brother Dale see out it see and then you you you'll go one way or you go the other way you'll put it to the basis of trying to how something you done or didn't do all right then you put it over and something you're doing or believing or whatever and it won't work well I believe this message so I know I'm saved well then what did God have to do with are you following me see you're saved by grace unmerited favor totally nothing you can do to receive it other than accept it but you must accept it you've got to accept what Jesus Christ done for you and I all right now but a rental might run one quote in here where he said in these mortal bodies we live in you know in other words his emphasis was we're in these mortal bodies well don't worry about it we're all born in sin shapen in iniquity spouse my mother's wound and going forth the liar every one of us well I'll tell you what I don't believe like what he's saying within all right tell me how you believe it but get the point now that I'm trying to drive the thought in you're saved by faith through I mean by grace through faith nothing you can do whatsoever then you start a journey now brother Branham will explain that as long as you're believing God you're doing great that's right that's where your salvation will deal upon your confession but if you stop believing God what happens do you lose your salvation no you just lost the confession because you didn't have the salvation cuz if you had the salvation you contend no that's the point right by grace through faith okay the statue of perfect man you start a journey and you keep going up through we teach that and we believe that but just remember your journey doesn't stop just at faith on the basis of the statue of a perfect man we look at it worse than uber that faith we have a journey before we get to the new work that we have to go through well I just believe it I just accepted it well now if your prophet is correct they will get later on to these but the future home he said I talked to reprocesses from the beginning he said from a boy and he said they hadn't changed one time well I've got work that definitely did I only said yes over here which said now are you going to talk to him don't talk to me go talk to him well that's impossible that's what I'm telling you so your thoughts are displaying what we are that makes us unbelievers he said I talked to reprocess is what justification sanctification the baptism in the Holy Ghost all right now see do we still teach it that way or do we just teach it as a believe the message well believe what we believe the Prophet well may I quote Paul have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe is that Paul did Paul make a statement have you received the new birth have you received salvation since you believe no God everything when I bleed now that's bad this doctrine all right so that puts you right where the Baptist is that you got it all when you believed it well I don't agree with that I didn't agree with it when I was in the badness all right the I could read the scriptures like being born again and all of that back there and it was a lot that that we could read and think about but the point listen a journey you as a when you started a journey in life as a baby right and you've been in that journey ever since no matter if you're 10 20 50 100 or whatever you are you've been in a journey we'll see why can't we think about that as a Christian journey that we've been in a journey and if you will think about it you can remember a lot about how that God contacted you or led you when you never even thought about it that you were going through a journey and never had any thoughts of what it was the people of the message has long forgot the fact that there's three it takes the justification sanctification the baptism and logos to make the new birth we just believe you accept the message that's the evidence that's know the prophet said the evidence is where the spirit Inu agrees with the word you know there's a lot of people out there right now you're going internet and run it up there's a lot I've been preaching 4050 years well they taught it right to start with but where are they now but get what I'm down by see everybody is saved by grace there is no special thing for different points or our view are well well brother Dale I had this seed in me where was it put when was it put right we just ended the series and the last thoughts that we were talking about of the future home was what that I don't want to predestinate myself totally out of existence because if God ever would go back to self existing then I would be out of existence did you listen to that yes but I I've predestinated before the world I agree your prophet he said that's where the seed was put that's what he said you need to quote he said when was that seed put there he said before the foundation of the world when you were in his mind well I come with a seed in me a seed is we're in the spring of planting time here this part of the country and you know you've got to have a seed to be able to put in the ground you got a plant to seed acceptable but just because you talk about having a seed oh but I am a seed I know we can quote the Prophet we can go with it I believe what he says about it all right but he said that seed was put in you before the foundation of the world now where was it put I've only asked this or the two sold people because that's word all of those things originated back there in the seventies last one simple question you say I had a seed in me put it in your body was it in your spirit was it in your soul and this brother he said I'm not gonna answer that well go to feeder answered one time you know me if he said body I said well then you gotta agree your body was before the world if you say spirit you gotta greet your spirit was before the world if it is you say so then you gotta agree your soul was before the world because the Prophet said it was put in there before the world ever begun let's see we've lost the point of salvation I think and go into the great understanding of what we call revelation and then we say we're saved by revelation brother deal you got it laying right there in front of you gonna read it to it amen that's what your prophet said but does that annihilate when you say you're saved by revelation does that change the fact that you're saved by grace through a revelation a journey have you forgotten your Christian journey do you remember when you started your Christian journey you remember when you repented of your sins and you asked God to forgive you and you remember then as you the word began to unfold that you could see that you stopped doing things that you used to do and getting cleaned up and set aside let's see that ain't to finish through the journey you still gotta have the new birth alright what is the new burns brother branham it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you what is the revelation personally you i'm just trying my best to tell you what it is my revelation of my new birth is exactly what I just read that I'm saved what by grace through faith if my experience ever comes to an end I'll know it was not genuine right acceptable in it I mean if this is any way that ever comes to an end then you didn't have what you're talking about all right see then it's a journey that we take a baby as I said I'm gonna go when it's born it starts their journey but the journeys not over because the baby's born right I just starts the journey all right so then your salvation starts the minute you believe amen we believe that it starts but that's not the end of the journey that's the starting of the journey see then you say well brother till all our God is based on this message that's all right that's fine with me I have no problem I'm just asking you a simple question what has that done to you if you've been in a Christian journey all in your life are you just well I just accept it by faith I got it all then where does all that work out to be wrong just making a little simple point this morning a simplicity to think about the Bible says that you can't come to God until God calls you that's Scripture huh you can't come to God till God calls you I accepted him huh I accept him but has he accepted you well all I could do is accept that's right but has he accepted you now the ain't accepted using there's something wrong with your accepting it's not wrong with him right I've heard people say you know there's one thing about it and boy their quota to God knows that I accepted him as my savior and it's up to him to save me that's a good point but what if we're following that wrong we were discussing a little bit out to our last night I mean I Wednesday night about your water baptism all right see the scripture says for you to repent and be baptized of the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins now what remits your sins the baptism come on what remix your sins is it your baptism yet I just read who repent everyone and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins there's a lot of people that were baptized incorrectly as far as terminologies and use of words when brother Branham came along little random never started the doctrine of water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it was already being used and then the question is like I was asking the brothers a simple question if somebody come in this church and I had a couple it did and said brother Dale we were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you know the Bible if you ever read it does the Bible say to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there is no scripture that says to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you can find it I'd love to have it this it's not there it's to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ but what's how close it is is water baptism essential under salvation according to that scripture it is if they never want to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the promise isn't you now listen there is no promise in the Bible of receiving the Holy Ghost because you were baptized Father Son and Holy Ghost I'd like to read that it's not there there are no promise under Father Son and Holy Ghost that's the Trinitarian doctrine that was a change of the word the promise is to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ Racines are not remitted through Father Son and Holy Ghost what are you saying that that that the baptism is a sense of baptism is essential if you know the truth go that's what your scripture says scripture said it's an answer of a good conscience right we run to water discipline to baptize and all the cities unto a good conscience you have attained a lot of people let's receive the new birth that never got baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I agree but once truth is presented come on once truth is presented and you don't follow truth what happens there's one thing for sure if you have the new birth but genuine born-again experience you will come to the knowledge of the truth and if you don't come to the knowledge of the truth you're answering of a good conscience is running in the face you're standing looking at that because the answer of a good conscience if you won't do what the word says that's what I'm talking about simple little point of salvation in a few things this morning if you won't do what the word says does God have to accept you what I accepted him but has he accepted you well I would rather I accepted him what else gonna do Abraham accept me oh that's right but God gave Abraham a sign of circumcision to show he'd accepted his faith right and beside that Abraham went to journey the journey of life to go through the topping of justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost he went through the example of that I said an example of it now listen see God accepted Abraham's believing if we refuse to do what the word says God does not have to accept our believing or let me put it this way God will not accept our believing thing we're proving there something wrong with our journey remember we can holler grace grace grace that's right but what about the journey you saved by grace through faith brother Brendan says you're saved a nun listen I'm quoting this one he said you're saved as long as you're confessing you're saved remember that we said when you stop confessing well you mean you truly be a born-again Holy Ghost field person and then lieu salvation no you can't but if you're just confessing on - you're just confessing on to your salvation you can lose that at any time all you got to do is lose your confession put them saying you have a grace that's good but what about the journey you followed a lot of the people of the message you're turning away from it now what their journey has come to a position of work that it's required some action or reaction by them and they've turned away from the word right is that God's fault but you know he's so great until all those years that's what I think about God you know you could serve God for 50 years and die and go to hell and you know for 50 years God will deal we trying to get you to straighten up he'll do it then you can lose it will you believe you you believe in salvation that you can how salvation lose it if you're listening to what I'm expressing I'm talking about salvation salvation has a lot to do with that there's a lot of people that confess salvation that never get born again well I thought salvation was all I needed that is if you know what salvation really is all you need is a new birth well what do i do then to get the new birth believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved that's all you're gonna do call this all you can do but now God will come on and honor that in your journey you'll find out somewhere that you want to strike somewhere in your journey that's what is through faith grace is wonderful that's great but what about the journey that follows the grace well it don't matter what I do cuz I bought born again you know I've had people tell me you can't tell me I've died when I accepted him that's wonderful as the journey changed I asked a brother-in-law of mine one time we were discussing water baptism and we were talking about was it essential I said well the truth is essential you know I mean that's one thing we've got to lay on the truth is essential what I done is I brought him out into a situation to were that he had to make a decision himself go what I asked him was I said how long have you been ministering and baptizing people he's at home that time was 10 15 years or whatever it was I said you you baptize all them new converts in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost right I said wool now let me ask you a simple question see what I was trying to do was prove to him what his confession was wrong or his there's something wrong with it I said what about from now and I said you've told me we're sitting here talking you told me it don't make no difference never heard that one it don't make no difference God knows who I'm praying to or being so if I'm baptized Father Son and Holy Ghost it don't make no difference you're just too technical I said okay simple question you baptized 10 years father son Holy Ghost I said how about for the next 10 years baptized name the Lord Jesus Christ if it don't make no difference he said I can't do that cuz he he knew I was there I come through that Baptist I knew he couldn't go along with it because the if you'd baptized any other way than that that Baptists hold to that baptism hard boy you can go from a Methodist to a Baptist your don't matter if you've been baptized as a Catholic and a Methodist and the Presbyterian ten or fifteen times you go to Baptist Church don't get baptized again though they hold that as your essential when I said all right now do you understand what I'm saying so for now you just turn around start back it don't make no difference the brother Tom five boys asked his former I believe is Methodist pastor Andy well you know it's okay whatever you do he said all right said you've been baptized sign thinking eyes he said from now on baptized the name of Lord Jesus cry I can't do that I've got to go along with tradition in other words I gotta stay with my church now you understand what I'm saying I'm not throwing off on my brother-in-law but I need none of what I'm talking about I'm just telling the truth see he proved that God had not accepted his faith now we're gonna get to that just lay it down a little bit and let you think about it it's true faith now right everybody following me you saved by grace all that's correct through faith all right so you started Christian journey when you were formed as a baby believing on the Lord Jesus Christ and all that you started then it goes on if truth is presented to you why would you not follow truth well I don't think it makes no difference okay we got no problem ain't go first an argue with you I'm just gonna be there to witness the next baptism cuz I know what you gonna do then i'ma say it does make a difference don't it of course could do like I did with a man at work I talked to this brother at work and you know he saw it now he said the Lord spoke to it I ain't arguing with him he said Lord spoke to him and told him to get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ verbally spoke to it I'm not joking I'm telling this is God's honest truth about it Russell okay now what you gonna do about it so he come in one day so they got that took care of said he got baptized name of the Lord Jesus Christ I said well great he said I won't call his name but he called him it was a preacher friend of mine he said he baptized me Saturday I said great he said baptize me both ways nothing cuz I knew what he'd done you know I said what do you mean he said we baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ baptized and Father Son Holy Ghost that's before you say anymore now you don't say no more to me I said I believe you got baptized both ways yeah I said now I'm gonna tell you how yours baptized I said that brother baptized to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ then he baptized you and Father Son and the Holy Ghost is that correct he said yes I said you erased your baptism I said if they depend of the basis you didn't understand and he had told you and you got baptized Father Son and Holy Ghost then got baptized Lord Jesus Christ you understand if you went thattaway it would have proved you were sincere and didn't know the difference but knowing the difference you've got baptized Lord Jesus Christ and erased it with father son Holy Ghost and this is his word he said don't you speak to me any more about these things he proved the point in his journey God had done the part of the grace right he had supplied the grace it's applied salvation in that race it even provided him with an opportunity to hear this message and even spoke to him now he said in an audible voice and told him to get baptized name of the Lord Jesus Christ although that was his confession but then when he wouldn't do it you understand what I'm saying God didn't accept him he accepted God right he accepted God and everything that he could do but God didn't accept him I'm not saying he's lost that's between him and God now come on you know way from that you just get what we're talking about yeah see the truth is essential under salvation well I didn't hear it I didn't know it God wings attack but now he said he commands all men to repent once the truth is brought see then you can say I've accepted him I accepted him I'd oh I was dark brother Dale I was burdened I went out and I believe he was calling me you know and I accepted him as my savior and that's the way they'll tell you you can't tell me I didn't do it either well now why are you trying to grow up about it I mean what are you trying to who you trying to convince right but has God accepted your confession to see you Lynn somewhere in your journey you'll come to a halt if you ain't made the correct start right there's like I told you about the the cups of brothers here that had told me that they were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and said because I was in a little series talking about and they said do you think we ought to be bad again I said let me ask you this question that's because I know the Bible the Bible doesn't say the Lord Jesus Christ it says Jesus Christ now listen put it together like the Prophet did and he took Paul that says Lord right Paul said to baptize name of the Lord Peter said Jesus Christ put it together you got Lord Jesus Christ your prophet had it correct but there were people baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for brother Branham ever started there was a lot of people baptized in the name of Jesus Christ what did somebody come in and ask you you think me being baptized the name of Jesus Christ is okay what are you gonna say well no I don't think well where's your scripture what are you gonna tell them what's your scripture scripture says Jesus Christ what reason are you gonna say you're not going to accept him do this what I've done with those two brothers I said let me ask you this question and we'll solve the whole problem I said is it not true that they baptized you under regeneration because you see that's what the people were doing back there they were baptized in the mode of baptism everybody move damn Old River those words are they had it correct they had it Jesus Christ but they were doing it under regeneration come on I said then according to that if I was you I'd get somebody to baptize me again if I was baptized under a point of regeneration or a church teaching regeneration why do you think Church listen why do you think that church world was so against brother Branham and his water baptism come on you don't never think why were they so much against him when there was a lot of people baptized Jesus Christ our Lord Jesus Christ come on go study a history get some of these older ones that was back there in the Pentecostal move there was a lot of churches teaching water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ our Jesus Christ before brother Branham ever come on the scene no I don't think that's right well good going to his print find out they go steady it a little bit find out forget what I'm saying why were they so much against him if they baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ our Jesus Christ well there's so much against him in his baptism remember the three hundred ministers who come together were basically Pentecostal the Baptists and Methodists didn't go right they were Pentecostal preachers 300 of them and he said you've challenged me on my baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ come on you're hurt you don't need never think things over sensibly out of that Shirley was a bunch of said well hey wait a minute discuss baptizing say my car would I baptized in the name of Jesus Christ he's baptizing languages finally brother Branham words say brother brother of repeats you more of baptism in jesus christ then he will lord jesus challenge it find it out study the message and see if brother Branham doesn't mention it's so much over and over he said they wouldn't baptize in the name of Jesus Christ you know why I done when I come into the message I heard him talk so much about cuz see I happen to know a little bit about the scriptures at that time not much but I understood a little bit and I knew the scripture said Jesus Christ not Lord Jesus Christ well you know what I was interested in all over other Dale you know yeah I was interesting one thing I wanted to find out who baptized brother Branham and I wanted to find out how he was baptized do you know the story of it do you know the story of it dr. Davis fight mistaken run baptized him but he baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he didn't just baptize him in name of Jesus Christ come on it took me a long time called we did not know computers but I found one day when he said said a man that baptized me in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ are you listening through your journey in or just do for people right over here if they came over and said we want to get baptized but what we want to do will to baptize our scripturally so once you're baptized us in the name of Jesus Christ would you do it no I wouldn't do it cuz it's gotta be large crop or you got your scripture they got description you ate that's the truth of it that could be further up the journey of Christianity or salvation then what you an hour and yet we're condemning them well brother Dale I think the Bible says it is baptized named Lord Jesus I'll find it well Krays God I like what brother George Canada said this this man he said something to him with him the man said well the Bible says so his own brothers your tone says well don't you go find it well I liked at least what the man said cousin brother George said he asked him later said did you ever find that he said no but I found a lot of other good things well at least we could find some good things you know but kill him saying here's a prophet he didn't change the scriptures come on he did not change the scripture that said Jesus Christ to Lord Jesus Christ and wants you to rewrite the Bible he done what jesus said jesus said to baptize in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost Paul said baptized in the name of the Lord come on Peter said baptized in the name of Jesus Christ Peter said baptized in the name of Father Son and the Holy Ghost and to do that you baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's why when I baptized somebody that's what I say to fulfill the Commission that the Lord Jesus said to baptize Father Son and Holy Ghost i baptize you my brother says in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ see Paul had to write with the Lord Peter had to write with Jesus Christ them together you got Lord Jesus Christ do you know you ain't got none argue about but why did they argue with brother Branham when a lot of them was baptizing that away they knew what he was talking about he was dealing with their water baptism under regeneration and they didn't lock that he taught strictly against that right he taught against baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ as a regeneration of phone you don't do that that's not what the scripture is saying when he said baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus right it means exactly what it says Father Son and Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ see now you got your scripture correctly see I'm still in the journey I haven't left the journey I can follow their journey of Lord Jesus Christ all the way through the Bible I haven't lost the journey I haven't lost the revelation well I don't understand because you know I mean we went to church now we've done this one don't shut Caprice your hand said I accept Jesus Christ amen that's great but what about the rest of the journey you just started your journey you telling me I'm saved cold I don't do this don't do that I didn't save you and I can't unsaved you but I like the way brother al said and we're gonna let him testify mr. second I liked what he said why don't you go up there Lula and let brother Dale talk you out of what you think you know something to that effect you see I believe it but I don't just put it all on grace you make it disgrace I thought we believed that our works was a display of the inward work of Christ in our hearts and salvation is that right our works out will listen to display what's within us as your journey stopped well brother Dale you shouldn't bring out things like you do cause it causes people to have problems problems if the word causes us to have problems we sure do need a lot of problem what I'm always open officer I'll be in they're going to get through coming let's say I'm talk about it I'm trying to get you to think about your your salvation and to be able to put together in your form of salvation all the things brother branham covers he said surely you're saved as long as your confession is correct do you need these quote but just remember the one thing our confession is great but has God accepted our faith the bible says abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness what was imputed cause you was a great guy had nothing to do with him he believed God and it was imputed unto him what for believing God he believed God and God accepted it believing now listen Church he's got a better hope than any of us has got if you're gonna lay on your works and your ideas and thought because he didn't put it on though that he knew who who he was and what was going on but God accepted Abraham's believing as he accepted our believer when he accepted that ground believing he gave him circumcision as a sign of his believing correct what is circumcision the type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost right am i right now circumcision is a type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost have you received Paul said the Holy Ghost since you believed come on you've heard brother run say in the Bible later letter said it means literally saying since you previously believed there's something happened to you have you had a journey are you still in your journey but we're still travelling in a journey because what Abraham started with was what Abraham he ended with right Cohn did brother branham exclaims Genesis 12 as justification Genesis 16 in sanctification on Genesis 17 going into the ninth as the baptism of the Holy Ghost going on into what we talked about as being adoption a change of name and things that's what blood around explains it can we say we followed that journey or are we just making about what I accepted him I've done all I can do now let me quote one to you on that basis you remember a little fella by the name of Cain now here's where brother Brennan said Cain said one day he said I've done all I'm going to do I'm paraphrasing that's very close he said I've done all I'm going to do I'm not going to do anything else that's pretty close it's close enough do you know the point in other words Cain said I've offered my sacrifice you wanted me to offer a sacrifice I've offered my sacrifice I've done this I've done that and I ain't gonna do nothing else who was it done was it buddy Robinson enough I'm quoting wrong with me but who was the one that said he's out in the cornfield he said now listen Lord said I'm gonna be right here and I'm accepting you and said if you don't accept me or don't give me salvation I'll be right here you'll find a pile of bones well that wouldn't him demand in God to come to him he had it right well it looked like he was saying God you know I'm betting oh he had it right he was putting it every bit up on God meeting him right there if we put it all on God meeting us in the word we don't have to worry about it okay choice of water baptism is it essential wise father son Holy Ghost not correct when it says Lord Jesus Christ Father Son and Holy Ghost you see why that your prophet was attacked by them not because of the wording he was using of Jesus Christ our Lord Jesus Christ because he knew their background was under regeneration other words if you say it like this if you say well I'll tell you what brother Branham baptized me wonderful I wish I'd had that opportunity that don't save you we went to Israel I've been baptized father son Holy Ghost when back same River down below right blood got baptized name the Lord Jesus Christ huh went to Israel out of 26 of us there was four people got baptized that was my wife and I and brother Dean given his wife sister Peggy rest of us said well we've been baptized will be back I said I don't care if I come back a dozen times I still want to get it if I went today I'd go to the Jordan River try to get me a good message believer to baptize me if I couldn't I'd grab me a good old Baptist and say I'm sure gonna listen to you now you make sure you say it right you say hey you're crazy I'm serious he didn't know now my water baptism to give back that I loved it because it's speaking of what I am me and the water baptism is not under regeneration but it's a promise now that's what I was saying while ago and I'll end on this stop there's no promise and Father Son and Holy Ghost cause you ain't even in the Bible right they don't promise and father-son hold ago you're not in the Bible the promise is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if we're not willing to follow what the word says is God obligated to make our salvation to be worth anything so you can say all you want to to me about I accepted him but I just say what the Prophet said has he accepted you well I don't know about that now cuz ain't none of my business that's up to him what he's gonna do but I accepted him and he can't deny you know how to deny though like I said Cain said Lord I've done all I'm going to do you take it or leave it you know what God left it he just left it well well Cain accepted God you ain't never heard brother branham talk about though son that if you're doing it on the basis of sincerity in the came with justice since there can't work this after death raising those beans and taters and corn and everything to bring all that up there enable lazy shiftless bum laid up over a hill over take Kirsten she I don't mean that wrong meaning truth it looks like Cain had the grater offering so much until the scripture said that you know how does it saying that a more excellent sacrifice we had a brother here one time explain it in great length how that Cain's offering was excellent I said then you're testifying that works is first and salvation is second I said that's why I'm not agreeing with you that's what I'm telling us I'm not agreeing Lee those Cain's offering proves what he was works as a form of salvation Abel proved it was by faith our grace and listen the Bible says and your prophet said then it was revealed unto Abel right well what do you think Cain said don't you think Cain walked up before God said now God is revealed to me works I'm working myself to death for you lord what is it better than what I'm doing look what I will do it he let up her on the hill and he murdered a calf I mean a lamb and I wouldn't do nothing like that I've lived a good life which one God accept you accepted one of the two now you take it what you want to come back to that point you say I've accepted God but has God accepted you you know he knows why we do everything come on musician he knows why we do it when we do it our purpose for doing it what a hot nothin he knows the hold on but just remember this now that we get back this afternoon we pick the thought up you're safe by grace through faith have
