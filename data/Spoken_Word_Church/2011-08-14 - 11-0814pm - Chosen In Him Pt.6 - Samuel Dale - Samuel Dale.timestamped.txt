[25:28] saying and I don't believe I've ever
[25:30] seen that boy before if I did he was

[27:23] with me
[27:28] good to see everybody in the house of
[27:29] the Lord if you'd like to turn back in
[27:31] your scriptures turn where we're read
[27:33] this morning from
[27:34] Ephesians 1.
[27:36] and John 15 and then we'll read John 6.
[27:41] so just
[27:45] remember these things remember the ones
[27:47] that are away waiting Aaron Brother Dean
[27:50] and preaching and being away from us and
[27:52] traveling back to keep them in mind pray
[27:55] one for another Lord with blessing God
[27:57] each one of us in his love you know uh
[28:01] sister and I'm not going to call her
[28:03] name but hernatius is milka
[28:09] gave me a thing about people sleeping in
[28:12] church and I thought it's a pretty good
[28:14] point you know we can we can we can
[28:16] build a new church
[28:17] like this because a guy was yawning and
[28:21] showing bad signs of being sleepy in a
[28:24] courthouse and they find him a thousand
[28:25] dollars you know so uh you know that'd
[28:30] be pretty good of course the judge was
[28:32] even nice enough to to take it down he
[28:34] took it down to 100 so still if we got
[28:36] the hundred it would would be all right
[28:38] and said there was a lady in the uh
[28:41] at the doctor's office or something and
[28:43] she was you know she had went to sleep
[28:45] and and all and she was really snoring
[28:48] away and the little girl woke her up and
[28:50] said Mama wake up you're not at the
[28:52] church
[28:56] so much you know no sleeping Spirits
[28:59] remember the box outside on the right
[29:02] just for uh to help people around here
[29:05] they won't help me in it but it's to
[29:07] help people around here so you just drop
[29:09] your money into the top slots you know
[29:11] as you're going to
[29:13] I understand the sleepiness that this we
[29:17] fight the best we can and do the best we
[29:19] can just understand what the older I get
[29:21] the worse it kind of gets on you you
[29:23] know and everything but and uh remember
[29:25] me the devil is still on his duties you
[29:27] know he's doing his good job he uh he
[29:30] jumped on to me now and they say that my
[29:32] throat has got a Gorder in the inside on
[29:35] the it's not wrote it what you call it
[29:37] is enlarged and they're wanting to do
[29:40] biopsies on that to see what it is now
[29:42] you're still knife and all of them say
[29:43] buy a Stripes I'm Healed because I ain't
[29:45] worried about what it what you're saying
[29:47] but they telling me you know that she
[29:50] said it's not closing in on you I said
[29:52] no it doesn't seem to bother me
[29:54] now that Matt does but it doesn't seem
[29:57] to bother me he said because you know
[30:00] I've always been able to just talk and
[30:02] go on anyway she said well we'll take a
[30:05] look at it okay so this week there or
[30:07] next week I guess it is one week we're
[30:09] supposed to look down in there and check
[30:11] it but you pray about it because I'm
[30:12] saying by the stripes I'm Healed you
[30:15] know older we get we're not as I've told
[30:18] you I don't get up every day expecting
[30:19] the new element
[30:21] that is not the way to be I get up every
[30:23] day realizing the older I get I probably
[30:25] will get one but
[30:27] you know that's no problem you just keep
[30:30] on going you know I don't want to stay
[30:32] in this old Pastor house in much longer
[30:34] anyway to you you know we're we want to
[30:37] get out of here and get into a change
[30:39] because that's the main thing is to
[30:41] still be in the word okay
[30:44] Ephesians 1 John 15 and John 6.
[30:50] dearly father we thank you for this day
[30:52] and we thank you for being what you are
[30:53] because we realize realization that
[30:56] there's nothing worthy in any of us to
[30:58] be able to be anything but yet you are
[31:01] the great of all things without you what
[31:05] would we be there would be no hope
[31:07] whatsoever and we would not even exist
[31:10] without a father to create us we realize
[31:14] that you are the father of all mankind
[31:16] but we as we're saying this morning
[31:18] that's not the kind of father you want
[31:19] to be you're wanting to be a different
[31:22] father with us we pray that you would
[31:24] just help us and lead us into that
[31:26] understanding of what you really want
[31:29] Lord you created us for a purpose now
[31:31] get out of us in the end time what your
[31:34] purpose is that you've created this God
[31:37] each one bless those that are away and
[31:39] Lord traveling back home be with each
[31:41] one give a safe journey we love you and
[31:43] we thank you and we commit everything to
[31:45] you as we read your words you come and
[31:46] speak to our hearts and our lives in
[31:49] Jesus name amen
[31:51] Ephesians 1
[31:56] verse 3 and 4. they should be the God
[31:59] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[32:01] has blessed us with all spiritual
[32:02] blessing in Heavenly places where in
[32:05] Christ according as he has chosen us
[32:08] were
[32:09] in him before the foundation of the
[32:11] world that we should be holding Without
[32:13] Blame before him in love now I'd really
[32:17] like to preach on that part of it but
[32:18] that's that's when you read the Bible
[32:21] and you try to bring something out and
[32:23] then it just keeps unfolding you know
[32:25] you know like that because it uh it
[32:28] takes him to make us holy right okay
[32:31] turn to John 15.
[32:35] 16 we'll just read that
[32:39] you have not chosen me but I have chosen
[32:42] you and ordained you that you should go
[32:45] and bring forth fruit and that your
[32:47] fruit should remain
[32:49] that whatsoever ye shall ask the father
[32:52] of the father in my name he may give it
[32:56] you now drop over to
[32:59] chapter 6 and verse 44.
[33:02] it says no man can come to me
[33:06] except the Father which has sent me draw
[33:10] him and I will raise him up at the last
[33:14] day so you may be seated the Lord had
[33:16] his Blessing for the reading I've got
[33:18] just a little bit on one part of a quote
[33:20] that they added in instead of trying to
[33:23] go into
[33:24] to the next message because
[33:27] it's hard to just try to preach
[33:29] something and you know Bring It Forward
[33:32] because it all ties together and we
[33:34] realize that but now remember what we're
[33:37] talking about we're back before the
[33:40] foundation of the world we're not down
[33:41] here in time and doing and and all we're
[33:45] still talking about the things that was
[33:48] there like the the old colored brothers
[33:50] that run around and spoke of that talked
[33:52] about you know how to do all everybody
[33:54] else are down on Earth preaching and he
[33:56] took them up in heaven now that man had
[33:57] something because he uh you'd be
[34:00] surprised how many probably a hundred
[34:02] times wrote around them I don't remember
[34:03] the exact number but it's a large number
[34:05] of references he makes to that you know
[34:09] you know but he's bringing it how that
[34:11] that man told what went on in heaven and
[34:14] then come down to earth well that's what
[34:16] I'm trying to do is talk about what was
[34:19] in heaven and then we'll come down to
[34:21] earth and see these things come into
[34:25] reality and we read here in John
[34:28] that
[34:29] verse 44 6th chapter and Jesus said no
[34:33] man can come to me
[34:36] except the Father which has sent me
[34:41] draw him
[34:42] and I'll raise him up in the last days
[34:45] now we don't believe in trinitarianism
[34:49] we believe in one God
[34:51] and we don't believe that God sent a son
[34:54] you know like in our references of of
[34:57] the uh the way we would think about it
[35:00] you know
[35:01] that we would pick somebody else to go
[35:03] down to do something
[35:05] and uh you know it's not as the
[35:07] trinitarian concept of thought is that
[35:11] you know there it was up in heaven and
[35:14] Jesus come over and said father I'd like
[35:15] to go down you know and do this or that
[35:18] or the other it's not in those forms
[35:20] right
[35:21] it's in the bases that
[35:23] God is revealing himself
[35:28] the unfolding or unveiling himself
[35:32] to bring himself into view to where that
[35:36] we can see and understand him right and
[35:39] see then the the son the the Creator the
[35:42] what we were talking about this morning
[35:43] the part of God that went out of God is
[35:46] Not Another God
[35:49] is God in another form or God taking a
[35:53] form to reveal himself
[35:56] see he's stepping over into something
[35:58] that uh that could be talked about
[36:01] because first it would be uh in the
[36:04] beginning as the prophet said before the
[36:06] Eternal and that's beyond our
[36:08] comprehensions of our mind but you know
[36:10] he knew something dark and and back
[36:13] there you can't even speak and you say
[36:15] well God we don't know who God is or
[36:17] what God is or or anything like that but
[36:21] see It's Beginning by way of the
[36:23] prophet's message after all of these
[36:26] years we should be getting a an
[36:28] understanding at least opened unto us on
[36:32] how the one true and living God truly is
[36:35] and that it's not God in three persons
[36:37] it's none of these other you said well
[36:39] we understood that 40 years ago well I
[36:42] doubt it so that's that's all right uh
[36:44] because I doubt most people still
[36:47] understanding it because it has to be
[36:49] revealed all right and it's the
[36:53] condescending of God so we never sent
[36:55] somebody else
[36:57] all right so then now the scripture says
[37:00] as the father had sent me what did Jesus
[37:04] say
[37:05] so I sent you now how did Brother around
[37:08] say he sent the father sinning
[37:11] he said he came in
[37:13] himself that's simple in it he came
[37:16] himself
[37:18] in that form but when you look at
[37:20] something and begin to be able to
[37:22] visually see it or any in any form of
[37:25] words to be used like in Genesis 1 God
[37:29] uh created the heavens and the earth
[37:31] when you're trying to get to that basis
[37:33] see it it's just words to try to express
[37:37] the the Eternal God that's trying to
[37:40] reveal himself all right and in doing
[37:43] that then if the if Jesus was almighty
[37:47] God in human flesh what are you and I
[37:51] are we a second person
[37:53] a third person or you know something
[37:56] or are we that same God
[37:59] just manifest in another way another
[38:01] form only this time it's a Mark it's a
[38:04] you know it's a mini-membered body
[38:07] right you know it's it's the bride of
[38:09] Christ
[38:10] and they're making him known to the
[38:12] world see I just don't believe that
[38:14] we're we're getting into that enough yet
[38:17] to understand that's just what I'm
[38:18] saying that I I keep going over and over
[38:22] and I will keep going over and over
[38:23] because I don't care I can take the same
[38:25] notes for each 20 years off of them I
[38:27] wouldn't have no problem because it's
[38:29] just the way it's made you can't exhaust
[38:31] an eternal word
[38:33] what we were trying to get on the
[38:35] thought this morning was
[38:37] is God's word being
[38:39] eternal
[38:41] and he he can never have another thought
[38:45] now see that that's beyond our thoughts
[38:47] right and that's why the scripture says
[38:49] that that my thoughts are not your
[38:51] thoughts my ways are not your ways he's
[38:54] in my ways and my thoughts are so much
[38:56] higher until
[38:58] see our thoughts are not even involved
[39:00] in
[39:01] right because it's it's unveiling of God
[39:06] how can you try to bring God down into
[39:08] words
[39:10] and as I was trying to say this morning
[39:12] about it see because that's bothered me
[39:14] for a long time is is how people they
[39:18] condemn you for preaching deeper things
[39:20] than they do and you know and and like
[39:23] that and and and they claim you're
[39:25] stealing their people from them or
[39:27] something and they don't want you around
[39:28] them because they're afraid to lose
[39:30] their people and it's really the truth I
[39:33] guess but still
[39:35] you know you're you're what it what's
[39:39] the point
[39:40] like I said on the day of Pentecost
[39:43] they heard a sermon
[39:45] but God
[39:48] come down
[39:50] and prick their heart
[39:54] and you think about it this this is this
[39:57] is what's been on me for for many many
[39:59] years to try to express it you just
[40:02] think about it
[40:04] do you know that you go say say you
[40:06] leave here and you go to somewhere where
[40:08] they never heard of God okay now there's
[40:10] an illustration
[40:12] I mean you you just go and you float
[40:15] upon an island and
[40:17] you get off and walk up
[40:19] and the people start running out with
[40:21] their Spears and their little bows and
[40:23] their things you know and darts and and
[40:25] you say I want to tell you about Jesus
[40:29] well
[40:30] sorry to say you're going to get full
[40:32] full of poison darts if God ain't on a
[40:35] person on the other end that's right you
[40:38] know
[40:40] I'm an honest right that's right because
[40:42] what do you got to show
[40:45] Peter them the owner death Pentecost
[40:47] didn't have any great miracles to show
[40:49] that would they would have could have
[40:50] reminded him of of uh what happened in
[40:53] Jesus's Ministry
[40:55] all right but I mean they didn't say no
[40:57] look you don't have seen all these
[40:58] people healed now you know you need to
[41:00] have what they got what we got they
[41:03] didn't they didn't do that
[41:04] they just give them a message
[41:07] and God came down into the heart of the
[41:09] individual
[41:11] and creeped that heart of that
[41:12] individual and they wanted to do it they
[41:15] wanted salvation right right yeah see
[41:17] but now like I said if you got washed up
[41:19] on an island and you're walking up there
[41:21] and here comes the chief out
[41:25] and he's done had a dream that
[41:28] something's gonna happen he's not had
[41:30] something maybe or somebody that God
[41:32] spoke to his heart
[41:35] and he said hold on a minute let's
[41:37] listen to this person
[41:39] it's not that that everybody knows the
[41:42] Bible and you just go and start talking
[41:44] to them about
[41:47] it they don't know the Bible
[41:51] and even those that know the Bible are
[41:54] the hardest ones probably to try to get
[41:56] converted
[41:57] because they've been taught so many
[42:00] different ways as we were using their
[42:02] one this morning we're running around
[42:03] and said you go into them he said all it
[42:06] does is form cults
[42:08] and then he was nice enough in it to say
[42:11] that he went thrown off on him he said
[42:13] they just need an understanding you
[42:15] remember
[42:17] when you say when we was in this and we
[42:19] were tonight yeah we was in college and
[42:22] you know we can be a cult right here at
[42:23] Lula
[42:25] yep exactly right because you were to
[42:26] look up the word when he did you find
[42:28] out what it means it's something
[42:29] contrary to to the practice or a point
[42:32] of what anybody else believes so the
[42:34] Methodist is to call to a Baptist
[42:36] advantages of course the Manchester this
[42:37] and and all this that and the other if
[42:39] they really went by that but when you
[42:41] establish a a mineral Middle Ground than
[42:46] anything contrary to that is a cult
[42:49] do anything contrary to a concept of one
[42:52] God entry person or you know whatever it
[42:55] is then they can call the rest of the
[42:57] world a cult
[42:58] see that's it's a cult it's something
[43:00] contrary to what you believe right and I
[43:04] like the scripture there where it says
[43:05] they went out of us from because they
[43:07] went out from us because it wasn't of us
[43:10] right when I left the Baptist they could
[43:13] say he left he went out on others
[43:16] because he wasn't one of us because the
[43:18] scripture said if he went one of us he'd
[43:20] saved him and that's that's true
[43:23] but you see we go over on the other side
[43:25] and we're looking back at it and we'll
[43:28] say it
[43:29] they went out from us
[43:33] and if they'd have been what we are
[43:35] they'd be where we're at that's right
[43:37] but you see I'm trying to get you to
[43:39] understand and and it it's like brother
[43:42] dick says about the the uh
[43:45] ability to come to a change of the body
[43:48] if you don't understand one true and
[43:50] living God how can you ever come to that
[43:51] concept
[43:53] I mean what can never be the point
[43:55] because you're still tied up into too
[43:58] many things if we don't understand one
[44:00] true and living God
[44:02] I mean by Revelation that's right
[44:06] that's right not just our understanding
[44:07] even open to the scripture yes
[44:10] what about revelation
[44:12] then we are as other people deceived
[44:15] amen
[44:17] and that that's that's something that
[44:19] we've got to get out of the
[44:21] but now consider the point of what I'm
[44:23] trying to get and I'll get back to this
[44:25] scripture to end
[44:27] no man can come to me Jesus said except
[44:31] the father
[44:34] that sent me drawing
[44:38] and the way that Jesus was almighty God
[44:42] is the way that your almighty God
[44:47] because you're an Offspring You're a
[44:50] child of God I wish I could get that to
[44:53] work but I wish I had some words for
[44:56] that to be revealed
[44:58] you would be running into each other
[45:00] shouting all over the place I know that
[45:01] because I know it's with me too
[45:05] I mean it's just this is honest no
[45:07] problem with anybody because I realize
[45:10] that it takes a revelation
[45:13] and you say but I see it
[45:16] well then
[45:19] there should be more life involved
[45:22] if I was looking we were the other day
[45:25] one of the messages the Priestess
[45:27] recently you see ever since I've been in
[45:29] this message I've been in the Revival
[45:32] 40-something years in a Revival well a
[45:36] Revival don't last that long it has in
[45:38] me
[45:40] what has it that happened in you that
[45:42] long
[45:42] some of you been around that long and
[45:44] longer
[45:46] but see what I mean about it it's not a
[45:48] great thing of signs and wonders and
[45:52] healings and things it it's a constant
[45:56] unveiling of God's word
[45:59] if that's not the greatest Revival give
[46:02] me that Revival you can have all the
[46:04] others right right all right and I'm not
[46:06] against all the others I'd love to have
[46:07] been there with each one of them but you
[46:09] know what each one of those revivals
[46:11] were was an opening of the word
[46:13] you remember one they had a great
[46:15] Revival back one time and they went back
[46:17] to this really checked up and see where
[46:19] did the Revival started from and they
[46:21] come find out it started from the
[46:22] cleaning lady that was going along and
[46:24] cleaning the seats she was saying Lord
[46:26] bless this person that says here Lord
[46:28] bless this you know why to create a
[46:30] Revival in the whole church well see
[46:33] then whose fault is it that we're not
[46:34] having a revivalist mine and yours right
[46:37] but I am having one
[46:40] I'm having a Revival because the word
[46:43] revive is for the Christian not for The
[46:46] Sinner
[46:47] right
[46:48] but I'm just trying to get you to see
[46:50] what I see or
[46:52] believe about God
[46:54] see to get you to understand it all
[46:56] right so then Jesus said you didn't
[46:59] choose me
[47:01] I chose you
[47:04] now how did we choose as I was I keep
[47:08] going back to it it's chosen Us in him
[47:11] all right who's the hymn it's Christ
[47:13] who'd under choosing almighty God
[47:17] back before you existed with the word
[47:19] god see that's our quick answer when you
[47:22] say God everybody says
[47:24] he not a god till he created something
[47:27] we'll run around can call him God and
[47:28] we'd rack before the world
[47:31] he can call him God and he said God
[47:33] would back there and gwelt alone
[47:39] well you know he didn't have to have
[47:41] nobody to explain that
[47:43] that God wasn't God at that time yet but
[47:45] around him you're all messed up
[47:47] he could enjoy just talking about God
[47:50] why can't we
[47:52] see that's what I'm saying we we're so
[47:54] trained until we we got into the bases
[47:57] that we can quote
[47:59] but but why
[48:04] is it why can't we
[48:06] believe what the Bible says about us
[48:09] why is it so hard for us to believe that
[48:11] we're the children of God now we can
[48:13] believe it
[48:15] in a way
[48:17] right yeah
[48:19] yeah now you know what I mean by that
[48:21] until you say whatever right now in a
[48:23] way right around that might be right he
[48:25] said no no such thing
[48:27] when you say in a way that means it's
[48:30] not diarrheal
[48:33] we're in a way now brother Dale actually
[48:34] I'm God now you don't see what I'm
[48:36] talking about
[48:38] you don't see what the Bible says you
[48:40] say in a way I can see that I'm I was
[48:42] chosen before the word you don't see
[48:44] what the Bible says
[48:46] he said what do y'all do
[48:49] no you don't because it's
[48:51] just hey that's right Jesus wasn't God
[48:54] in a way that's right you know he was
[48:58] either God or wasn't God right
[49:00] all right we're even The Offspring of
[49:02] God and we're not The Offspring of God
[49:03] we're either the children of God by the
[49:05] new birth and we are not the children of
[49:07] God simple language
[49:09] right
[49:11] but see I want a revelation
[49:14] you say you do it yeah because it's been
[49:17] revealed to me and that's what I'm
[49:18] speaking on what's revealed to me but I
[49:20] I believe that will keep unfolding
[49:24] because to me I believe that is the end
[49:27] time the message
[49:29] and I'm going to say this person when
[49:31] you do what you want to you remember a
[49:33] few weeks ago a couple of services ago
[49:35] that I was preaching about the hidden
[49:37] body would unite in the last days to
[49:39] bring the message
[49:40] your brothers Branham said win the fully
[49:42] matured work would come see him we're
[49:44] expecting God to come down and anoint
[49:47] our understanding all of those things I
[49:49] believe we're here at that time
[49:53] I never make predictions or anything
[49:55] like that at the end of time there's
[49:58] there's no need to think of what and
[50:00] none of us are right anyway
[50:01] and like I told you you sit down and you
[50:04] take 365 people and each one of them say
[50:07] well it's going to be this day and in
[50:09] this day nothing this day you still got
[50:11] a force to deal with
[50:14] you got that one day out of four years
[50:17] to deal with so it can't be done
[50:20] why don't we believe what God Said
[50:23] that's where I believe that her healing
[50:25] problem is that we don't believe what
[50:27] God Said God says we're healed we want
[50:30] to see something happen
[50:32] we want to get better or we want the
[50:34] doctor to tell us we're better
[50:37] instead of saying What God Says
[50:40] let me say it until the last moment and
[50:43] then don't put it on my Tombstone that
[50:45] he died with this
[50:46] put it on there he died saying it's
[50:49] healed
[50:50] Why Can't We Believe What God Says
[50:53] Lee all right so just keep going
[50:56] and believe it all right now let's get
[50:59] down to where we left off this morning
[51:01] and we were talking about the thoughts
[51:03] of God being eternal
[51:07] and be into the bases you know that
[51:11] our names were written on the last book
[51:13] of life
[51:14] but being to the basis of one thing
[51:18] now let me try this hard into our
[51:20] thoughts
[51:22] if God
[51:24] cannot have a new thought
[51:28] and we were talking about that this
[51:29] morning God's thoughts are Eternal now
[51:31] if you can't have a new thought
[51:37] then
[51:39] he could not speak a word
[51:43] that would not come to pass
[51:47] right you agree yes yes
[51:51] I mean whatever he says
[51:53] must come to pass
[51:59] now we could go in there and we can
[52:01] figure it all out but brother Dale you
[52:02] don't understand that could be this for
[52:04] this person or it could be different
[52:06] that may be true
[52:08] but why can't we believe it's for us
[52:16] I believe the eternal life that I have
[52:21] is a part of God's own life amen all
[52:24] right
[52:25] and that part of God's own life
[52:28] was before the world ever begun or
[52:30] before anything was ever even thought
[52:32] about it in the world to do it like I
[52:35] said this morning then I don't want to
[52:36] be just in God's mind well brother that
[52:39] was just in God's mind he just saw these
[52:41] things in his mind and he done this
[52:44] what
[52:46] no
[52:50] I want to be a part of his mind amen
[52:54] I want to be a part of the Thinker yes
[52:57] right
[52:58] I want the one that's doing the thinking
[53:00] to live in me amen right see then that
[53:03] to me is what the Bible says let the
[53:05] mind that was in Christ be in you
[53:08] that's not the brain
[53:10] because it's not talking about it's
[53:11] almost soul mind being what you are
[53:15] let the mind that was in Christ not his
[53:18] transplant of his brain or or
[53:19] intelligence no
[53:21] it's the soul it's the lie that's why
[53:24] it'll make you a new creature
[53:28] and that's what we want
[53:31] we want Christ to be made manifest all
[53:33] right see but when God speaks a word
[53:36] it's got to happen that's right amen
[53:41] now he can't promise you something and
[53:43] take it back that's right amen
[53:46] that's why I believe the Bible says you
[53:48] know and I believe that scripture and
[53:50] seen it produce itself where he says
[53:52] you'll be there with your offspring
[53:54] I believe it
[53:58] yes yes
[53:59] I mean I believe what he said yes right
[54:03] yeah
[54:05] you know there's a lot of things in the
[54:07] Bible that can't be explained there's a
[54:09] lot of things in life can't be explained
[54:11] that's right someone said in the Bible
[54:13] said the other day I wasn't making a
[54:14] joke of that we just all have a good
[54:15] time in Bible study we just sit around
[54:17] and laugh and have a good time and
[54:19] someone said something about the
[54:20] slim-eyed people you know and I said
[54:22] well if you'd been hanging upside down
[54:24] all of your life
[54:28] we think we're on top don't you
[54:31] who's on top
[54:33] you know
[54:36] we're hanging in space who's up Who's
[54:38] down
[54:39] you know how to do with your eyes
[54:41] planting they just just we make you know
[54:43] we just having a good time talking about
[54:45] God's glory and I think
[54:48] all right
[54:50] but listen Church
[54:52] me God stops
[54:56] are Eternal not now listen
[54:58] they're not just perfect
[55:03] now to be honest it's beyond our
[55:05] comprehension to have a mind that would
[55:07] be perfect
[55:09] right right
[55:11] it's beyond our comprehension to have
[55:13] anything perfect
[55:18] they said oh
[55:22] the old store or we have now the the
[55:26] Mustang
[55:28] you can go buy a brand new Mustang
[55:31] 56 Mustang no you can't
[55:37] you can't do it
[55:41] you might buy a restored one put back
[55:45] together into pieces and part but most
[55:47] of the time it's going to be pieces of
[55:48] two or three of them but
[55:50] right
[55:51] but see we we think we have it under our
[55:54] understanding
[55:55] and being in our understanding we think
[55:58] we comprehend
[56:00] what's going on but remember it's got to
[56:03] be revealed
[56:05] amen no matter how simple it is
[56:08] the prophet would say like this he said
[56:10] you don't need a revelation about water
[56:12] baptism he said it's right there in
[56:14] black and white
[56:17] but then he turned around and say pray
[56:20] for God to reveal those things to you
[56:23] because see the revelations on one God
[56:25] if you see the one God you don't have no
[56:28] problems with seeing water baptism but
[56:30] you know what
[56:31] if you don't see one God you're not
[56:33] going to believe what's the scripture
[56:35] that's right
[56:37] you're still going to believe in a
[56:39] trinity that's right but see we're not
[56:42] believing What God Says
[56:45] the prophet never come to give us
[56:47] another Bible
[56:48] another interpretation another he come
[56:51] to turn us back to the original word
[56:53] amen well what's your problem
[56:57] hmm
[56:58] why can't we just settle down and
[57:00] believe it okay let's get started I'm
[57:02] gonna spend it too long
[57:04] all right go to
[57:06] the last book of life
[57:09] paragraph e or E 58 because you'll have
[57:13] to do that in a second
[57:14] 1956 603
[57:17] it'd be number seven on your notes
[57:19] because I said I keep giving you these
[57:20] notes you know until we get through
[57:22] because I want you to take these notes
[57:24] home and read them
[57:25] I want you to take these things home and
[57:27] read them
[57:29] and so what did brought around say
[57:32] I mean he gives us the answer
[57:36] thank you
[57:37] you shouldn't crash to make sure God
[57:39] revealed he says it like himself but
[57:41] it's a question what is the new birth
[57:43] brother Brown
[57:45] then you say what is the newborn
[57:49] well they've been talking this audition
[57:52] see
[57:54] now what did he say
[57:58] he said it's a revelation of Jesus
[58:00] Christ
[58:01] personally to you
[58:05] is that deep
[58:08] you don't watch deep because it done
[58:10] away with all them things you used to
[58:11] think the new birth of us
[58:13] they just shattered them but that's what
[58:16] I'm saying if we have any question why
[58:18] can't we ask the prophet
[58:21] okay
[58:22] you know what I'm talking about that's
[58:23] the message
[58:25] well that's your way pulling it we'll
[58:27] pull up some and bring it to me shall be
[58:29] different
[58:30] I want to be right my soul is involved
[58:34] in this thing
[58:36] I want to be right I want to know
[58:38] yeah but you need some I'll
[58:40] agree with you on that now don't come
[58:41] and tell me what I don't think right
[58:43] bring them bring the goods and lay them
[58:47] out
[58:49] write the Bible in the message and lay
[58:51] them down and we'll spend weeks
[58:54] studying it together
[58:57] is because our shoulders involved in
[59:00] this right
[59:03] eternal life is decided in this message
[59:05] in times
[59:08] but look what he says
[59:11] he's praying they said our heavenly
[59:12] father we thank thee this morning for
[59:14] Jesus we thank thee for the Perfection
[59:16] of the gospel for the perfecting and the
[59:19] Eternal sovereignty of God's Eternal
[59:22] spoken word now sovereignty means
[59:25] nothing else can be added right nothing
[59:26] else can be done that's sovereign
[59:31] and according to his word he called us
[59:34] and chose us in him before the
[59:36] foundation of the world and wrote our
[59:37] names
[59:38] before the foundation of the world when
[59:41] God speaks a word it's got to happen
[59:44] it's good just got to happen so then he
[59:48] says and you and you spoke our names
[59:52] when you spoke his name
[59:55] you chose us with him before the
[59:58] foundation of the world so there's
[1:00:00] nothing we can say we could do Lord
[1:00:04] now listen there's nothing we can say we
[1:00:07] could do Lord
[1:00:11] oh
[1:00:14] no argument
[1:00:16] either God's right or wrong
[1:00:18] which one is it
[1:00:22] either God's word is right
[1:00:24] or wrong
[1:00:26] if it's wrong let's go home forget him
[1:00:28] man
[1:00:29] have a good time because we're all old
[1:00:31] enough we're fixing to die anyway so
[1:00:32] don't worry about it
[1:00:35] keep on with Obamacare ain't no telling
[1:00:38] what we're gonna have
[1:00:39] no I ain't worried about him ain't no
[1:00:41] different nobody else
[1:00:43] you put in all of the others on the
[1:00:45] other side it's not going to do any
[1:00:46] difference everybody's got their way
[1:00:48] we're going to straighten this out ain't
[1:00:50] nobody can straighten this out we've
[1:00:52] probably done told you you can put a
[1:00:53] George Washington in every office in the
[1:00:54] country
[1:00:55] now think about it
[1:00:58] George Washington Abraham Lincoln in
[1:01:00] every office in the country he said
[1:01:02] can't pull this out right
[1:01:06] he said well if we just had George no he
[1:01:08] can't pull it out
[1:01:10] right why because the devil is behind
[1:01:12] everything that's right
[1:01:15] gives the politics he's out of the
[1:01:17] things
[1:01:20] but think of it all right now if his
[1:01:22] word is true
[1:01:24] now the point of me using these quotes
[1:01:27] after this quote is for one thing
[1:01:30] if God's word is true why cannot We
[1:01:34] Believe God's word
[1:01:38] the prophet of God is to give us the
[1:01:41] interpretation of the word of God is
[1:01:42] that true that's right it's not to give
[1:01:45] us his own ideas or thoughts or concepts
[1:01:49] all right Jordan if we read then these
[1:01:51] things
[1:01:52] see what I want to be able to do is just
[1:01:54] say listen Church do we believe the word
[1:01:56] of God to be true
[1:01:59] more to just say okay the Bible said we
[1:02:02] were chosen in him before the
[1:02:03] foundational World forget it
[1:02:08] we know God's gracious enough to us to
[1:02:10] have sent us a message that would tie
[1:02:12] together the word of prophet could speak
[1:02:13] in the 50s and 40s and 60s and all and
[1:02:17] still be using the same form in the same
[1:02:19] thing
[1:02:21] to get us to see
[1:02:23] why didn't he just walk out on the Ohio
[1:02:25] River and say
[1:02:27] he's here
[1:02:28] let's go home
[1:02:33] you know what he was there
[1:02:35] right right he proved it was that right
[1:02:38] right but you know God's a good god he'd
[1:02:41] give us 40 years
[1:02:43] sure there's been a lot of dilding
[1:02:46] playing around
[1:02:47] man but he's given 40 years because
[1:02:49] you're looking at a man now you can say
[1:02:50] what you want to argue anyway but you're
[1:02:52] living in a man named Dallas around a
[1:02:54] diddle-daddling this message for 40
[1:02:56] years now you can't say that
[1:02:58] well brother you're preaching the same
[1:03:00] thing right now you would 40 years ago
[1:03:02] I'll agree with you but it's in a deeper
[1:03:04] depth
[1:03:06] I'll agree with you because I was free
[1:03:08] today because that's what I saw I
[1:03:10] believe God's Bible
[1:03:15] if it's everything everyone be baptized
[1:03:17] out of the name of Jesus Christ I think
[1:03:19] we're a good baptize the name of Jesus
[1:03:20] Christ don't you right man
[1:03:22] Lord you do what God says right
[1:03:26] but you see then my point is using these
[1:03:28] quotes to back up what he's saying that
[1:03:31] the the thoughts from the morning's
[1:03:33] message that God's word is eternal his
[1:03:35] thoughts are Eternal you can never have
[1:03:37] another one and then we're reading that
[1:03:39] when God speaks a word it's got to
[1:03:40] happen right
[1:03:42] right
[1:03:45] when he said
[1:03:48] the voice of one crying in the
[1:03:50] wilderness what is it Isaiah 42.
[1:03:53] was there any way in the world
[1:03:55] that that would not take place somewhere
[1:03:59] upon the Earth that's right
[1:04:02] oh
[1:04:04] it had to be
[1:04:06] because God said it that's right amen
[1:04:11] if he said they'd be in rapture
[1:04:15] is there any way that could be changed
[1:04:18] okay
[1:04:19] you see any possibility that Satan can
[1:04:24] stop the word of God from being true
[1:04:28] no why
[1:04:30] so when he tells you something
[1:04:37] but see we believe in as long as it's
[1:04:39] working okay
[1:04:44] I remember a brother one time I'm not
[1:04:47] throwing off on him but he was going to
[1:04:48] get a uh an albino groundhog
[1:04:52] don't kill one and uh I'm not throwing
[1:04:55] off on him now I love the brother no
[1:04:57] problem just I'm just saying to him
[1:05:00] we got a lot until the day I die I
[1:05:03] confess I was going to get an albino
[1:05:05] groundhog
[1:05:07] hi but I wouldn't sit in my my house and
[1:05:10] wait I'd go out in the wood
[1:05:12] because there ain't too many albino
[1:05:14] groundhogs or blue groundhogs or any
[1:05:16] colored groundhog gonna come in your
[1:05:17] house
[1:05:19] try to at least go to the woods
[1:05:22] right
[1:05:26] that's what your brother kept telling me
[1:05:28] he's going to kill this deer and I said
[1:05:29] well we don't get honey we don't do you
[1:05:32] know good time in New York
[1:05:35] because you didn't say it would be in
[1:05:36] New York you said there's one I shot at
[1:05:41] thank you
[1:05:42] go then go go this way that's right
[1:05:50] I went and did about the property it
[1:05:52] just built me a housecoat he said I shot
[1:05:54] at him I just sit right there waiting on
[1:05:56] it to come to my you know
[1:05:58] but you see then when it don't come
[1:06:00] device then you start propping things
[1:06:01] off
[1:06:02] I ain't no need to profit nothing up
[1:06:04] just stay with it like it is
[1:06:06] all right what did he say
[1:06:10] well let's take a few quotes you know
[1:06:13] just from doing it for the point like I
[1:06:14] said for to see that wrote around said
[1:06:16] it and it wrote around and said it is
[1:06:17] what the Bible said
[1:06:19] don't you believe that okay 1959 1223
[1:06:24] questions and answers paragraph 129
[1:06:27] or in Jeffersonville he said now you
[1:06:29] that's been called like that
[1:06:33] I want to speak to you you the chosen
[1:06:37] ones that God chose us in him
[1:06:41] before the foundation of the world think
[1:06:43] of that
[1:06:45] God chose us in him before the
[1:06:47] foundation of the world
[1:06:50] God knew before the foundation of the
[1:06:52] world that I speak this same subject
[1:06:55] tonight
[1:06:56] he's infinite
[1:06:58] amen now don't you think God knew you'd
[1:07:00] be sitting here today
[1:07:04] right now a brother years ago brought
[1:07:08] around and told his brother said you
[1:07:09] said you had to fight your way all the
[1:07:11] way to a meeting at Jeffersonville I
[1:07:13] talked with a man personally that talked
[1:07:15] with this other man so I wish I were
[1:07:16] saying but anyhow
[1:07:18] he and he asked the brother said well
[1:07:21] when you went to that meeting he said
[1:07:23] you feeling different he's not got in
[1:07:25] the car drove up there
[1:07:27] well see there's no telling what the man
[1:07:29] went through
[1:07:30] let me tell them how many wrecks
[1:07:34] was deterred from him don't tell him
[1:07:37] what took place to be able to bring the
[1:07:39] man to that place
[1:07:43] you know what I'm talking about he might
[1:07:44] have been running on a rubber band car
[1:07:46] you know what I'm saying when he's
[1:07:48] fixing to pop and God kept it from
[1:07:50] popping until he got there right
[1:07:55] right see if God tells you something
[1:07:57] I don't mind it I'm not running around
[1:07:59] him if God said God told me raised
[1:08:02] George Washington he said I'd invite the
[1:08:04] world you know what most people do
[1:08:06] let me sneak up a few of y'all won't go
[1:08:08] along we'll sneak up to
[1:08:14] sneak up there and try to raise him from
[1:08:16] the dead and then we'll go tell the
[1:08:18] world no no no no
[1:08:20] God came to me come to pass I stood
[1:08:24] right here and told you Wade was coming
[1:08:26] back before he came so that settled it
[1:08:29] I told my wife he'd be preaching in this
[1:08:31] bullpit with me
[1:08:33] when he was still in the world
[1:08:36] if God tells me something I'll just tell
[1:08:38] you
[1:08:40] he's told me this on one God that's why
[1:08:42] I'm trying to tell you that's where it's
[1:08:44] been always my point of trying to take
[1:08:46] the things that others don't want to
[1:08:48] tackle the Sydney went to Daniel the the
[1:08:50] the the the things and managing divorce
[1:08:52] and things like that and speak on them
[1:08:56] why because he told me and I ain't going
[1:08:59] to come here tell you that he tells me
[1:09:02] because I got enough sense to know I
[1:09:04] can't figure it out
[1:09:07] I got a lot of questions still left in
[1:09:09] my mind
[1:09:11] but they are gradually coming to pass
[1:09:13] that there are not as many questions
[1:09:14] amen you know
[1:09:17] because I have questions about this I
[1:09:19] told you I did
[1:09:21] I couldn't see exactly I knew that we
[1:09:23] was in him I could see that but I
[1:09:25] couldn't understand how
[1:09:26] and how to bring it down without it
[1:09:28] being something that would be contrary
[1:09:35] how did he chose us
[1:09:38] when we thought we chose him
[1:09:41] me come on with it look at what he said
[1:09:47] God chose us in him before the
[1:09:49] foundational order he said just think of
[1:09:51] that
[1:09:53] what a wonderful thing
[1:09:57] to think about God shows us
[1:10:00] well well he didn't choose these others
[1:10:03] I've explained that
[1:10:06] everybody in the world was not a child
[1:10:08] of God it never will be a child of God
[1:10:10] correct
[1:10:12] no the choosing was not that way and
[1:10:14] season to choosing is not like we think
[1:10:16] the choosing of explained that over and
[1:10:19] over and over here's one more time
[1:10:22] it's not that God sat down and I'll take
[1:10:24] this and I won't take that one I'll
[1:10:26] choose this and won't choose that one
[1:10:27] there's no such thing
[1:10:30] right that would make him a respecter
[1:10:32] person
[1:10:33] the point is that he chose
[1:10:37] to condescend downward
[1:10:40] you remember that get that in your mind
[1:10:42] he chose to condescend downward to
[1:10:45] reveal itself to his children
[1:10:50] to his offspring
[1:10:57] that's why he's a father
[1:11:01] I told you this morning I'll go ahead
[1:11:03] and answer it for you
[1:11:06] Adam never made God a father like he
[1:11:09] wanted to be right
[1:11:11] even Christ standing there was a
[1:11:15] completeness in him before the world to
[1:11:18] be able to create and calling that
[1:11:20] hashan was not a word that would make
[1:11:22] him as a father he wanted to be
[1:11:28] he wanted to be a father to his children
[1:11:33] that would be part of him
[1:11:37] and that started on the day of Pentecost
[1:11:42] a new creation
[1:11:43] a new race
[1:11:46] that's why Jesus
[1:11:48] brother random says the only way that he
[1:11:51] could be a father was to be the son of
[1:11:54] man
[1:11:56] now what is he saying that are you
[1:11:58] listening yes
[1:12:00] why did he say that
[1:12:02] because the son of man was almighty God
[1:12:05] in human flesh agree and you know what
[1:12:08] he done he's so deceived through his
[1:12:10] mouth that's right
[1:12:12] he sowed you and I into this world
[1:12:16] the seed
[1:12:20] he stood there just as he stood back
[1:12:22] before the world and said let there be
[1:12:23] in a world slung off and these things
[1:12:25] happen
[1:12:26] he stood right there on the earth and
[1:12:29] preached the gospel which so deceived
[1:12:35] and if we're not one of those seeded he
[1:12:37] sowed we will have eternal life as a new
[1:12:40] person
[1:12:42] so what did he do how does he become
[1:12:44] father
[1:12:46] he wants to be is right now in the new
[1:12:48] birth
[1:12:49] he's your father
[1:12:52] he now has what he wanted it started on
[1:12:55] the death Pentecost he has exactly what
[1:12:57] he wanted
[1:12:58] to be a father of a new race of people
[1:13:02] and Jesus was the beginning of the
[1:13:04] creation of God Amen and Brethren said
[1:13:06] we are the rest of that creation that's
[1:13:09] right
[1:13:10] because God was wanting to come down to
[1:13:13] reveal himself he could do that in
[1:13:15] Christ
[1:13:19] but he wanted to reveal himself to his
[1:13:21] creation are the people not through the
[1:13:23] world he wants to reveal himself to his
[1:13:25] children amen this is not revealed this
[1:13:28] can't be revealed to the world you might
[1:13:30] run around said even the book of
[1:13:31] Ephesians was not written to the world
[1:13:33] he said it was written to those in
[1:13:34] Christ
[1:13:36] when Paul said he'll say in the
[1:13:39] scripture we've been reading that he
[1:13:40] chose us in him that wasn't written to
[1:13:42] the world
[1:13:45] that was written to those that are in
[1:13:47] Christ
[1:13:51] go to The Sinner can't get the word of
[1:13:53] God he can only get the word to get him
[1:13:55] convicted to be saved that's right
[1:13:58] sure he can have a lot of hit knowledge
[1:14:01] we cannot come down into his heart
[1:14:03] you realize you realize what I'm trying
[1:14:05] to say that the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:14:07] down through the seven churches is now
[1:14:09] making him the father that he always
[1:14:11] wanted to be
[1:14:15] he always wanted to be a father
[1:14:17] now listen
[1:14:18] as I told you we only look at the Healer
[1:14:21] the savior
[1:14:23] here and savior didn't make him a father
[1:14:29] healer and savior deals with her son in
[1:14:31] the basis of the son coming in to do
[1:14:33] what he had to do
[1:14:37] what was that point to your thinking
[1:14:40] but see Savior and here has to do what
[1:14:42] Jesus done on earth right
[1:14:45] he had to come and pay the price on
[1:14:47] Earth for to be the Savior to heal her
[1:14:49] yes
[1:14:52] hmm
[1:14:53] but listen
[1:14:55] was he not a Healer in the Old Testament
[1:15:03] come on
[1:15:04] yeah
[1:15:06] and he was a father in the Old Testament
[1:15:08] as far as
[1:15:10] father you realize that every person in
[1:15:14] the world now listen please close
[1:15:17] ever born again I mean every person
[1:15:20] that's in this world has ever been in
[1:15:21] this world
[1:15:22] is a child of God by creation Satan
[1:15:26] cannot create
[1:15:31] so he's the father of all even the lost
[1:15:34] people that's right
[1:15:36] why because he created them
[1:15:41] that didn't make him the father he
[1:15:43] wanted to be
[1:15:46] he wanted to be a father over his own
[1:15:48] children he wanted to come and live in
[1:15:50] you and I
[1:15:54] to make us his offspring
[1:15:57] to make us him
[1:15:59] May manifest amen that's the only way he
[1:16:02] can be the father that's right
[1:16:04] it can't be any other way
[1:16:09] see the fall didn't make him father
[1:16:11] he was already a father
[1:16:14] the fall made him a redeemer
[1:16:20] the father was the father
[1:16:23] that's why Jesus could say our father
[1:16:28] he could speak back to a father
[1:16:33] he said well I don't understand that
[1:16:34] because he was God who was he praying to
[1:16:38] he was praying to his father
[1:16:41] who do you break it
[1:16:44] I pray to my father
[1:16:47] because now I know who my father really
[1:16:48] is
[1:16:49] yep all right okay you know that's right
[1:16:52] now what's the point reading these
[1:16:54] quotes
[1:16:55] to show the word is spoken about us in
[1:16:58] this let's get on with it okay
[1:17:01] paragraph 57 questions and answers 53 7
[1:17:05] 29
[1:17:08] go right down to the bottom what I got
[1:17:10] under lines you read all the rest of us
[1:17:11] want to give it to you according as it's
[1:17:13] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[1:17:15] world that's pretty good isn't it that's
[1:17:18] not pretty good that's real good
[1:17:21] now listen to your profit before there
[1:17:24] was a foundation of the world God knew
[1:17:26] armor Neville and knew that he'd
[1:17:29] preached the gospel isn't that wonderful
[1:17:31] has chose why he's a member of the
[1:17:34] church and God knew he was going to have
[1:17:36] that church he said Paul was speaking to
[1:17:40] the Church of Ephesus said he has chosen
[1:17:43] Us in him now we're all the members of
[1:17:46] the body of Christ is that right and God
[1:17:49] before the world
[1:17:50] was ever formed chose you and I in him
[1:17:54] before the world was ever formed we
[1:17:57] might isn't that wonderful
[1:18:02] I read 43 the Perfection 1957 for 19.
[1:18:06] then my salvation your salvation tonight
[1:18:09] does not hinge upon the merits of our
[1:18:12] own Acts
[1:18:15] okay
[1:18:17] it hinged
[1:18:19] I like that past tense upon the positive
[1:18:23] Sovereign Grace of almighty God who has
[1:18:27] chosen Us in him certainly
[1:18:30] I could never be perfect
[1:18:33] nor you could never be perfect
[1:18:36] and we don't claim to be perfect but we
[1:18:38] have this one consolation that our faith
[1:18:41] rests in a perfect sacrifice that's
[1:18:43] already been received already been
[1:18:47] received
[1:18:50] run around said the minute you sin
[1:18:53] you want this quote
[1:18:56] the minute you sin
[1:18:58] he says already been taken care of
[1:19:03] man
[1:19:05] now it doesn't say that you can pay for
[1:19:08] it before you do it
[1:19:10] doesn't work
[1:19:13] so here's one we read this morning from
[1:19:15] questions and answers 123rd at 127 59 12

[1:20:49] member of this mythical mystical you how

[1:21:17] next and Wednesday night I got three
[1:21:18] pages out of church egg books already
[1:21:19] run off
[1:21:21] because I love to read what he says
[1:21:24] and to see that he keeps it talk
[1:21:27] and runs it through so that's what he
[1:21:29] said did we choose him huh oh right
[1:21:31] around him I I beg your pardon I didn't
[1:21:34] know
[1:21:36] you according to the word you didn't
[1:21:38] Jesus said you never chose me I chose
[1:21:40] you oh yeah when did he choose it when
[1:21:43] when Jesus
[1:21:45] say he chose his church
[1:21:48] before the foundation of the world
[1:21:49] according as he has chosen Us in him at
[1:21:53] the life Revival that Dr so-and-so had
[1:21:55] no no you might read that in a Creed a
[1:21:58] textbook but not in this one see
[1:22:00] according as he had chosen this in him
[1:22:02] before the foundation of the world when
[1:22:03] we were chosen at the last Revival the
[1:22:06] night we got saved why when when there
[1:22:09] wasn't no world was no star there was no
[1:22:12] atoms no molecules that's when we were
[1:22:15] chosen amen oh don't let me start
[1:22:18] preaching on that I'm just trying to
[1:22:20] explain something here all right before
[1:22:22] the foundation of the world that we
[1:22:23] should be
[1:22:24] what members know we should oh after
[1:22:27] we're saved we just do as we want to no
[1:22:30] we should be holding Without Blame
[1:22:32] before him membership no no it's love
[1:22:36] ain't it that's right all right in love
[1:22:38] excuse me I'm just cutting up I guess
[1:22:40] now I shouldn't do it all right you know
[1:22:43] having predestinated oh predestinated us
[1:22:45] unto the adoption of children the seed
[1:22:48] from the beginning
[1:22:51] no problem
[1:22:53] I'm living a seed
[1:22:57] the children of of children by Jesus
[1:23:00] Christ himself according to good
[1:23:01] pleasure as well
[1:23:03] who did it God when did he do it before
[1:23:05] the foundation of the world then if we
[1:23:08] come in in an illegitimate birth then we
[1:23:11] come in an illegitimate birth through
[1:23:14] ease corruption making us all her
[1:23:17] children a subject to death
[1:23:19] then the Sovereign God has to make a way
[1:23:22] to redeem his children
[1:23:26] what does redeem mean
[1:23:31] what does redeemed mean
[1:23:36] to go back where we come from
[1:23:41] then the Sovereign God has to make a way
[1:23:44] to redeem his children why all that the
[1:23:47] father had given me will come to me and
[1:23:49] no man can come unless my father draws
[1:23:51] him oh my where's your great big thing
[1:23:54] you've done
[1:23:56] you never done nothing you ought to be
[1:23:58] ashamed God who done all things the
[1:24:01] wheel is working just right
[1:24:02] Christ is a mystery of God reveal
[1:24:04] paragraph 1 6 182 1963 728 when did he
[1:24:09] choose us before the foundation of the
[1:24:11] world when this great hidden Mystery is
[1:24:13] great secret so you can tie the whole
[1:24:15] Christ The Mystery of God reveal to the
[1:24:17] what I'm talking about
[1:24:19] that he had a plan and a purpose and a
[1:24:21] hidden Mystery
[1:24:22] that he was going to be revealed
[1:24:26] he was going to reveal it it was all in
[1:24:29] there that he chose us now here's where
[1:24:31] the hidden Mystery is that's the Christ
[1:24:33] is the mystery of God revealed he didn't
[1:24:36] say Jesus is the mystery
[1:24:37] see Christ is the mystery
[1:24:40] all right Christ being the mission
[1:24:42] where's Christ at Christ in you I
[1:24:44] thought the Bible said the hope of glory
[1:24:48] I thought that's what the new word was
[1:24:50] right
[1:24:51] Jehovah Jireh part three not uh 62 707.
[1:24:56] paragraphs 57
[1:25:00] . now let's background Abraham first God
[1:25:02] met Abraham unconditionally
[1:25:06] nobody made with Abraham
[1:25:09] not anything at all Abraham had nothing
[1:25:12] to do but believe God
[1:25:14] the Covenant was purely by grace
[1:25:17] and unconditional not if you will
[1:25:21] God said I have
[1:25:23] and now every man remember all
[1:25:26] Abraham's seed that ever come to God
[1:25:29] comes the same way
[1:25:32] not nothing you could do nothing
[1:25:35] you there's not nothing you could do you
[1:25:37] could not save yourself no more than you
[1:25:39] could take your boot stress but I won't
[1:25:41] used to protesting I really love it and
[1:25:43] jump up over the moon you cannot save
[1:25:45] yourself no man ever sought God is God
[1:25:48] seeking man you never chose me said
[1:25:51] Jesus I chose you
[1:25:56] 1964.
[1:25:58] 402 Jehovah Jireh part one
[1:26:02] progress 17. and that's the way it is in
[1:26:05] any life
[1:26:06] it takes God it ain't what you do it's
[1:26:10] what God does see you say I saw God I
[1:26:12] sought God you're mistaken no man seeks
[1:26:15] God God seeks the man see it's not you
[1:26:18] seeking God it's God seeking you
[1:26:20] Jesus said you haven't chose me but I
[1:26:23] chose you see so you're Joe so you're
[1:26:26] chose before the foundation of the world
[1:26:28] or you wasn't chose at all
[1:26:31] good point right
[1:26:33] you just come to redeem that name
[1:26:36] and all whose names are not on the
[1:26:38] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:26:40] before the foundational World he's the
[1:26:43] only one's going to be there now you've
[1:26:44] got to tie together what he's saying
[1:26:45] because you know what he's not saying
[1:26:47] the point that the little words go Lord
[1:26:50] Foundation word he's the only one's
[1:26:51] going to be there anyhow because your
[1:26:54] name was not on the Book of Life
[1:26:56] it will never be there but if it's on
[1:26:58] the Book of Life you can't change you
[1:27:01] were chosen than him before the
[1:27:03] foundation of the world when the lamb
[1:27:04] was chosen then you were chosen with him
[1:27:06] before the foundation of the world and
[1:27:09] you are as I said last night an
[1:27:11] attribute of God's thinking see that's
[1:27:13] the only way you can be Eternal and only
[1:27:16] form of eternal life there's only one
[1:27:18] form of eternal life and that's God's
[1:27:20] so that's all he is the one that's
[1:27:23] eternal
[1:27:24] right all right going down God's only
[1:27:26] provided place of worship paragraph 271
[1:27:30] 1965 11 28 the morning service Moses was
[1:27:34] in him Joshua was in him
[1:27:36] and if you are in him you was in him
[1:27:39] before the foundation of the world the
[1:27:41] family of God you suffered for him you
[1:27:43] died with him you went to the cross with
[1:27:45] him you raised with him
[1:27:46] and now you're still with him sitting in
[1:27:49] Heavenly places reflecting the message
[1:27:50] of the age to the world the likes of the
[1:27:53] world right
[1:27:55] now
[1:28:00] how did we suffer in
[1:28:04] in things how did we die in him
[1:28:07] not that we were little bitty pieces
[1:28:10] running around in his body not that we
[1:28:12] were a DNA hook up in his body right
[1:28:15] it's the eternal life
[1:28:19] it was in him how were we before the
[1:28:22] world I don't want somebody on the tape
[1:28:24] gun so far and then they throw off and
[1:28:26] say oh that's what old brother so and so
[1:28:27] did all right let's bring it all back
[1:28:30] I don't care what Russell said I only
[1:28:32] tell you what I believe
[1:28:37] I believe you didn't come into the world
[1:28:38] with eternal life
[1:28:40] because he did Jesus Christ you didn't
[1:28:42] have to die that's right I don't solve
[1:28:44] that problem that should that statement
[1:28:46] should solve everything
[1:28:47] all right
[1:28:49] but you come into this world
[1:28:53] knowing god knowing one thing that you
[1:28:55] would want to be saying amen
[1:28:58] and that's just for knowledge
[1:28:59] transmitted over into Earthly times
[1:29:02] but the eternal life that you have in
[1:29:04] you was a part of God before the world
[1:29:07] ever begun
[1:29:09] come on there's not enough to eternal
[1:29:11] life
[1:29:15] and see then it's got to come down to a
[1:29:18] basis
[1:29:20] that I can be redeemed
[1:29:25] back to the eternal life
[1:29:27] that
[1:29:29] once was
[1:29:32] that's the only way I can be reading
[1:29:36] I can't be redeemed because I can quote
[1:29:37] a random or the things no I can only be
[1:29:40] redeemed because
[1:29:42] that
[1:29:43] I wish for the eternal life that I'm
[1:29:46] talking about it brother around and said
[1:29:47] you always was eternal that's the
[1:29:49] eternal life you have in you that always
[1:29:51] was eternal I never had a beginning
[1:29:54] right
[1:29:56] you see the people this quote always was
[1:29:58] eternal they won't go through the whole
[1:29:59] message to express
[1:30:01] see what God done for you and I that we
[1:30:05] had to come to this world and be lost
[1:30:06] and he had to come down and become one
[1:30:09] of us and had to die to release that
[1:30:11] life that's right amen that's right
[1:30:14] to worry could come back
[1:30:16] because there's no way to explain what
[1:30:18] the prophet is saying
[1:30:20] it's got to be revealed he said we were
[1:30:23] in him right
[1:30:25] now
[1:30:27] then he goes and says
[1:30:30] that despair in Jesus's side is what
[1:30:34] removed us from him
[1:30:38] explain that
[1:30:44] there's no human mortal on this Earth
[1:30:45] can express that and explained
[1:30:50] but around couldn't explain that
[1:30:55] come on show me
[1:30:59] the spirit of his side he said remove
[1:31:00] the bride
[1:31:07] which we understand
[1:31:12] now he was already dead
[1:31:14] when the spirit went in the shot
[1:31:18] right
[1:31:21] so you can't explain how that we could
[1:31:23] be inside it's just a way of saving
[1:31:26] things
[1:31:29] how else can you say it we was in him if
[1:31:32] we was in him we had to be removed
[1:31:33] somewhere
[1:31:36] when the spirit went into his side the
[1:31:38] blood and water came out
[1:31:39] which was his life
[1:31:42] but the life had already left the body
[1:31:44] and that blood didn't drop down on the
[1:31:47] earth and then happened to hit me and
[1:31:49] you get part of that
[1:31:52] there's no way to explain sometimes
[1:31:55] that's right I believe that's right
[1:31:57] you got to accept What God Says amen
[1:32:01] all right when are we going to get to
[1:32:02] the point that we can't accept you
[1:32:06] listen to what your Prophet had to say
[1:32:08] on a message being led of the Holy
[1:32:10] Spirit
[1:32:11] E30 which is 56 219 number 18 as you
[1:32:15] notice you don't understand
[1:32:18] there's no need in trying to explain it
[1:32:21] listen to it you just believed it
[1:32:25] I ain't trying to explain it no more
[1:32:30] are you reading what your Prophet said
[1:32:33] people's going to believe are well
[1:32:35] that's all I'm going to do about it
[1:32:38] that's up to God to do the rest I can't
[1:32:41] take his job
[1:32:43] now that's as honest a man this could be
[1:32:45] even right
[1:32:48] that he couldn't do
[1:32:51] it takes God to repeat it if God's not
[1:32:53] pulling on your heart strings it won't
[1:32:55] never work
[1:32:57] show faith and believing and if you're
[1:33:00] ordained to eternal life Jesus said no
[1:33:01] man can come to me except
[1:33:03] my to come to me anyhow except my father
[1:33:05] draws you that's right and if you were
[1:33:08] ordained to eternal life to see and
[1:33:10] believe you will and if you want it's
[1:33:12] just like pouring water on the Ducks
[1:33:13] back you need to do no good at all no
[1:33:16] matter how much you try to explain it
[1:33:18] those who God has chosen before the
[1:33:21] foundation of the world and if you are
[1:33:23] chose in God you were chosen not here
[1:33:26] you were chosen before the world began
[1:33:28] do you know that
[1:33:30] yeah
[1:33:32] and see what are we doing let me listen
[1:33:34] I just ran you the other one off
[1:33:37] we're running around talking about the
[1:33:39] the things they're saying that
[1:33:42] you can't come to me except the father
[1:33:44] drawers
[1:33:46] right
[1:33:49] now let's go back and read that
[1:33:51] scripture
[1:33:52] because you'll see that
[1:33:55] around always quotes it a certain way
[1:33:58] and there's only one time
[1:34:00] that the computer runs him that's using
[1:34:02] it this way no man can come to me except
[1:34:05] the Father which has sent me draw him
[1:34:08] right around him says no man can come to
[1:34:11] me except the father draws him
[1:34:13] now did he change the scripture
[1:34:18] no that's what it said it's just not
[1:34:20] even he only used it one time let's see
[1:34:22] if I can find it
[1:34:26] it's on these numbers to get to you the
[1:34:28] ones we're on this afternoon
[1:34:29] number one number number 21 okay
[1:34:35] let me get
[1:34:44] number 21 would be the unconditional
[1:34:47] Covenant that God made with his people
[1:34:49] uh e26 page 54 3-0 I mean
[1:34:55] 54 306. man said oh brother I shot god I
[1:34:59] saw no man ever shot god
[1:35:02] not in a man to seek God no man at any
[1:35:05] time at any age ever saw God
[1:35:08] it's just vice versa God's seeking the
[1:35:10] man not man seeking God Jesus said no
[1:35:14] man can come to me except my father
[1:35:16] draws him is that right see that's the
[1:35:18] same still
[1:35:20] still the same way but around is quoting
[1:35:22] it
[1:35:23] then he draws it but see the scripture
[1:35:24] actually says no man can come to me
[1:35:26] except the Father which has sent me draw
[1:35:29] him
[1:35:32] but random always says it
[1:35:35] draws you
[1:35:37] know changing scripture God is what he's
[1:35:39] doing but he's telling you what happens
[1:35:41] that's exactly what I've been trying to
[1:35:43] tell you all the whole service of what
[1:35:45] happened
[1:35:46] let's read that scripture and see what
[1:35:48] happened no man can come to me except
[1:35:50] the Father which hath sent me
[1:35:57] now as he's in him
[1:35:59] came down went any
[1:36:02] right right John 6 44.
[1:36:07] with that May draw him
[1:36:12] Joy we're not of the same material he
[1:36:15] can't draw us
[1:36:19] the Bible calls us of the same source
[1:36:29] no man can come to God unless
[1:36:34] to Jesus said nobody can come to me
[1:36:35] except the father draws me
[1:36:37] see you can't be a son and daughter of
[1:36:40] God unless God has foreigned you to be
[1:36:42] so
[1:36:45] when he comes I will in no wise cast him
[1:36:48] out I'll give him everlasting life
[1:36:50] all of these quotes you'll find on Me on
[1:36:53] the same thing it's on this one
[1:36:55] talking about
[1:36:58] the fact
[1:37:00] that the father has to draw you first
[1:37:02] one quote said
[1:37:06] as I said on the death Pentecost you
[1:37:08] might have thought I was just trying to
[1:37:09] make a point this morning of some form
[1:37:11] but on the day of Pentecost
[1:37:15] they heard one sermon
[1:37:17] they did not hear three and a half years
[1:37:20] of preaching they heard one sermon
[1:37:24] about a man that had died on a cross
[1:37:28] and they were convicted in their heart
[1:37:31] how many people have heard sermons about
[1:37:34] a man dying on a cross
[1:37:41] I see God does the drawing
[1:37:45] and the Reason God does withdrawing is
[1:37:48] because his own it's his children
[1:37:52] he's drawing his children
[1:37:57] you're going to come to save his
[1:37:58] children
[1:38:00] there'll be a lot of people giving
[1:38:02] eternal life but he only come to save
[1:38:03] his children
[1:38:06] and when they come to Satan's offspring
[1:38:11] well brother now how do I know whether
[1:38:13] or not there's a quote on one of those
[1:38:15] there brother said you're sitting here
[1:38:17] he said something spoke in your heart
[1:38:20] that's right how many times have you
[1:38:23] ever heard him make this expression
[1:38:27] he said do you want something from God
[1:38:29] to raise your hand
[1:38:32] he said now
[1:38:34] it's impossible for you to raise your
[1:38:37] hand
[1:38:39] he said there has to be a spirit within
[1:38:42] you
[1:38:43] that's right
[1:38:45] right
[1:38:46] there's a spirit within you makes your
[1:38:48] hand go up
[1:38:50] right God is Not one's a problem with
[1:38:52] hitting you on the head and your hand
[1:38:54] don't go up
[1:38:55] right you know what I'm saying you
[1:38:57] become immobile
[1:38:59] that spirit
[1:39:01] he said you made a decision yes
[1:39:05] you say come down here and I'll pray for
[1:39:08] you people get up to come down he said
[1:39:10] when you left the seat you're healed
[1:39:14] he said cause you made a decision
[1:39:17] how many times you ever listen to the
[1:39:18] messages like that
[1:39:24] he said you made a decision
[1:39:26] what about the man that brought around
[1:39:28] spoke up that said he went everywhere
[1:39:30] all over to different preacher
[1:39:32] and all to try to be saved
[1:39:35] but around said
[1:39:38] you remember when you picked up that
[1:39:40] track
[1:39:42] the track red said where where you spend
[1:39:45] eternity
[1:39:50] come on
[1:39:52] your Prophet said and the man turned
[1:39:54] around he said you may not saved right
[1:39:56] there he said yes
[1:40:01] yeah but he didn't shouting crimes Glory
[1:40:03] had a look at it no he didn't
[1:40:06] but he believed it amen
[1:40:10] something spoke in the man's heart
[1:40:13] and he started searching for God
[1:40:18] how many of you can remember
[1:40:20] when God spoke to you in your heart
[1:40:26] and told you you're lost
[1:40:32] can you remember it
[1:40:34] the greatest time of your life was that
[1:40:36] day that's right
[1:40:39] because that's when God contacted you
[1:40:43] amen then you could do something about
[1:40:44] it that's right
[1:40:46] you could choose to accept him as your
[1:40:48] savior see that was the father of
[1:40:50] drawing him
[1:40:54] that was the positive of God drawing you
[1:40:57] from where you were
[1:41:01] did no man could come to the father but
[1:41:03] by Me Jesus name
[1:41:04] unless my father Johnson
[1:41:07] all right
[1:41:11] let's see
[1:41:13] it's not for everybody but we can't
[1:41:15] preach it's not for everybody about to
[1:41:16] preach it's murder everybody because we
[1:41:18] don't know who the children are that's
[1:41:20] right
[1:41:23] but it's only four of you Offspring on
[1:41:25] God
[1:41:28] Jesus said the one that sent me is once
[1:41:30] drawing you
[1:41:32] know what he was saying
[1:41:34] saying that's why I said brother I'm
[1:41:36] always just he usually says drawings you
[1:41:39] you didn't use that other points because
[1:41:41] that's what it's doing
[1:41:45] the one that led Jesus Christ in this
[1:41:48] life is the one that spoke to you and
[1:41:49] told you to turn around
[1:41:51] and run around talking did he say to
[1:41:53] Charlie he said Charlie the voice that
[1:41:54] told you one day stop and turn around he
[1:41:56] said one day the same voice would tell
[1:41:58] you to come up
[1:42:03] mine because it's the voice of God
[1:42:07] Elijah didn't care about the Thunder and
[1:42:09] the light in the clouds and the storms
[1:42:11] and everything else is going on
[1:42:13] it was a little still small boy
[1:42:18] what about it
[1:42:20] has the father been drawing you yes
[1:42:25] have you been drawn closer
[1:42:27] to God by the opening of his word
[1:42:32] or is it like I was saying this morning
[1:42:34] is it getting given from the prophet
[1:42:36] that it's getting dull and you go away
[1:42:37] and you go to other churches and do fine
[1:42:43] when are we going to get to the base of
[1:42:44] standing on What God Says
[1:42:50] you know somebody one of these days will
[1:42:52] understand you and say I'm changed
[1:42:57] does God be safe
[1:43:00] you gotta say you're sick you're healed
[1:43:03] you got to say that you're saved
[1:43:06] but he won't save you without it being
[1:43:08] said
[1:43:09] do you say well what do we do then
[1:43:12] why don't you just following that dude
[1:43:17] you follow that and it brought you to
[1:43:18] the church
[1:43:20] for some reason you're here today
[1:43:21] whether you're Christian or
[1:43:23] non-Christian
[1:43:25] well I'm here called mom and daddy made
[1:43:27] me come that's a good point
[1:43:30] yeah
[1:43:32] I hope and keep making you come until
[1:43:34] God gets to hold heavy
[1:43:40] but nobody can come to God unless
[1:43:44] the father draws you
[1:43:47] what about the drawing power in the
[1:43:49] stand again
[1:43:50] the drawing power of almighty God
[1:43:54] draw his people
[1:43:57] took place
[1:43:58] to receive eternal life
[1:44:02] what about a church
[1:44:05] eternal life
[1:44:06] the greatest thing that could ever be
[1:44:12] Jesus said all that the father had given
[1:44:14] me will come
[1:44:17] you think there's anything Satan can do
[1:44:19] to stop it you sure got a misconception
[1:44:21] of God in his ways
[1:44:25] another round of reference and one time
[1:44:27] about making a place to where his son
[1:44:29] would be safe and he said it wouldn't
[1:44:32] matter if you could pour concrete for I
[1:44:34] forgot how many wide it was and how deep
[1:44:36] and all and in case it around and he
[1:44:38] said
[1:44:39] no
[1:44:40] which if he's in God
[1:44:44] and take care of it
[1:44:49] why do we worry why are we scared why
[1:44:51] not all of the problems with people and
[1:44:53] you're going to start seeing them do it
[1:44:54] more and more people are losing their
[1:44:56] home by the millions now around the
[1:44:58] country
[1:44:59] losing their jobs losing everything
[1:45:01] thank God you got a home and a job
[1:45:06] right amen because they're falling apart
[1:45:09] now you keep falling apart for a while
[1:45:11] you're going to see them worse than it
[1:45:12] wasn't under depression because in a
[1:45:14] depression they at least was able to
[1:45:16] knew Mom and Daddy was at home and had
[1:45:18] something that went back home
[1:45:22] they went back to the farms and was able
[1:45:24] to make a living for a few years gonna
[1:45:26] the economy began to turn
[1:45:28] there's nowhere to go now
[1:45:33] all of our food he said well I'm going
[1:45:36] to buy some food all of your food there
[1:45:39] is no such thing as a storage anymore
[1:45:42] right
[1:45:43] everything is coming straight from the
[1:45:45] guy that's raising it straight to the
[1:45:47] camera and straight to the grocery store
[1:45:49] that's right there is no Surplus in
[1:45:52] America
[1:45:57] they won't let us do it
[1:46:03] but think of these things
[1:46:06] if we're in Christ we don't have to
[1:46:07] worry about nothing
[1:46:09] he took care of us all this way
[1:46:14] I told you I used to be as a human
[1:46:16] mortal I was kind of that away and
[1:46:17] always been I never did like to to
[1:46:20] venture out on a lot of things and you
[1:46:22] know and all and and going especially
[1:46:24] places and I was going down the road one
[1:46:26] day and I was going to Thomaston really
[1:46:27] on Highway 36 going down and going down
[1:46:30] to deer hunt with another time where
[1:46:32] Dean's brother and uh
[1:46:35] you know what I was thinking well
[1:46:37] I've never been this way before
[1:46:40] you know when they talked about her in
[1:46:41] the Bible said you ain't never been this
[1:46:42] way before you know kind of pull up
[1:46:44] tighter you know the other end and
[1:46:45] everyone is fixing to cross over because
[1:46:47] you ain't never been this way before
[1:46:48] when they hadn't and uh but in a minute
[1:46:51] there's just like something said well
[1:46:52] somebody's been this way before you're
[1:46:56] riding on a road that somebody made the
[1:46:59] roads got to be going somewhere so just
[1:47:02] follow it you know okay you don't have
[1:47:06] any problem sexy
[1:47:09] but I realize that road going to leave
[1:47:11] me somewhere around turn around and come
[1:47:12] back
[1:47:15] let's see think about it
[1:47:17] if you were chosen in him
[1:47:20] what great thing did you do when you got
[1:47:22] into this world
[1:47:24] if he chose you before the world
[1:47:28] what great thing did you do when you got
[1:47:30] here to make him want to choose you
[1:47:34] but you see we want to lay it all I want
[1:47:37] to find out we want to lay it all on the
[1:47:39] bases that he he uh
[1:47:41] looked down and saw
[1:47:45] forgive me for a second
[1:47:50] this is all for the message the church
[1:47:52] age book page 265 the sardesian church
[1:47:55] age
[1:47:56] and he said he's quoting the scripture
[1:47:58] no man can come to me except the Father
[1:47:59] which has sent me this is the one we're
[1:48:02] used at draw him draw him and we'll
[1:48:05] raise him up at the last day
[1:48:07] armenianism you know what armenianism is
[1:48:11] armenianism is works and deeds and
[1:48:14] doings Armenian to work arm you do you
[1:48:18] you done something to get saved
[1:48:20] me that's armenianism all right
[1:48:22] armenianism makes the will of the father
[1:48:25] not a sovereign purpose
[1:48:29] but merely a complacent desire
[1:48:33] as he stands back to see what all men
[1:48:37] would do with his goods and gracious
[1:48:40] gifts
[1:48:41] and even
[1:48:43] life eternal
[1:48:45] thank you
[1:48:47] armenianism is thinking that you had
[1:48:49] something to do with it
[1:48:51] you was good enough to be saved or are
[1:48:54] you done too much to be saved you know
[1:48:57] you ever had the devil tell you that
[1:48:59] you're just too mean to be saved
[1:49:02] well then I look back to find out the
[1:49:04] Bible that was the people he saved
[1:49:09] but around in the church a book he said
[1:49:11] he chose Moses he chose this one he
[1:49:13] chose that one he said what are they he
[1:49:15] said liars and different things
[1:49:18] right
[1:49:20] you go back and try to figure out what
[1:49:21] did any of them do Abraham gave his wife
[1:49:24] away a couple of times
[1:49:26] right one time he Matthew had the change
[1:49:28] of the body
[1:49:30] foreign
[1:50:32] my heart
[1:50:46] praise
[1:50:59] I want to talk to you about my father
[1:51:04] 's day I have a wonderful father
[1:51:10] get to know my natural baby I guess
[1:51:12] that's why I may be worried I can be
[1:51:14] like I am
[1:51:17] he passed away when I was about four
[1:51:19] years old
[1:51:22] but I found my real father
[1:51:27] and I found out what if Desiring is is
[1:51:30] to be a father
[1:51:33] like I've always told you my kids could
[1:51:36] never do enough wrong
[1:51:38] killings and murdering or whatever to
[1:51:41] make me the word and I would not say I
[1:51:43] was their father
[1:51:52] to make me deny them
[1:51:57] doing up wrong we're going to not want
[1:52:00] to be your father
[1:52:03] all you got to do is lay down all of
[1:52:05] that thoughts and what did I do
[1:52:08] God ain't done for me like he has for
[1:52:10] other people
[1:52:13] what do you mean
[1:52:16] when I see people that are that are are
[1:52:19] you know become Christians and they just
[1:52:21] don't have no more troubles why don't

[1:52:33] but I feel always happy and overcoming
[1:52:35] and going

[1:54:23] it be for their benefit
