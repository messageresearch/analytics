[10:04] doings and the things and all and the

[10:12] come now as we read your word and speak
[10:14] about you for a little while that you'd
[10:16] come on the scene and open our eyes
[10:18] because that's our desire more than

[10:39] right we love you in Jesus name
[10:44] amen we're going to read from Hebrews 11
[10:46] 1-2 and then verse 11 and then be seated
[10:50] and we'll read some more out of Hebrews
[10:52] okay so we're trying to I don't know
[10:55] where we going to make it today or not
[10:57] but uh we'll try to get through if we
[11:02] can on most of it today uh the Lord
[11:04] willing brother Bob will be preaching
[11:07] for us Wednesday you be here okay I have
[11:10] to check with some of these sometimes
[11:12] because they they miss on us and we have
[11:13] to make sure they're going to be there
[11:15] they're you know out traveling and doing
[11:18] their their preachings and the different
[11:20] things
[11:22] but so let's read a scripture now Faith
[11:25] is the substance of things hope far the
[11:28] evidence of things not seen for by it
[11:31] the elders obtained a good
[11:34] report all right now remember what we've
[11:36] been doing is covering the report that
[11:40] these Elders have
[11:42] made all right now we get over and we'll
[11:45] get back to her in a little bit but we
[11:48] go to verse 11 it says through faith
[11:50] also sah herself conceived strength to
[11:54] conceive seed and was delivered of a
[11:56] child when she was past age because she
[11:59] judged him faithful who had promised so
[12:03] you may be seated to the Lord at his
[12:05] Blessing to the reading of the
[12:07] word now we've been covering for quite a
[12:12] while on and I thought it was uh good
[12:16] and and lined up real good with a lot of
[12:18] the brethren in their speaking of
[12:21] talking about a positive attitude you
[12:24] know because that's what we're trying to
[12:26] to talk about but what is our point of a
[12:29] positive
[12:30] attitude you can only have a positive
[12:33] attitude if you're sure of where you're
[12:35] at if you're sure of where you
[12:39] stand then you can be positive about it
[12:42] if not you will you know wish you wash
[12:45] you backwards and forth you'll have
[12:47] doubts and problems and things and what
[12:50] has always been my point everyone in the
[12:53] Bible that ever amounted to anything
[12:55] which we know no matter what would be
[12:57] the amount that they did did but all of
[13:00] those in the Bible did amount to
[13:02] something and each one of them had a
[13:05] positive
[13:06] attitude about their
[13:09] part and God would take that and write
[13:12] it and make a book out of it and it
[13:15] would be a beautiful picture to line up
[13:18] for all of the 66 books and all of the
[13:20] things to line up together to show the
[13:23] uh the understanding of God and bring it
[13:27] out to the right place
[13:30] but now what I want to do is because I
[13:32] don't want to take each each individual
[13:34] see you could be on what I've here in
[13:36] this Revelation I mean Hebrews 11 you
[13:39] could send another two or three years on
[13:41] it because we're taking each one but
[13:44] what I want to do is just kind of read
[13:46] each one not comment a lot but take that
[13:50] and then move into our thought so go
[13:53] ahead brothers and pull up Hebrews 11
[13:56] and we'll start with verse 17 now I'm
[13:59] leaving out some reading purposely that
[14:02] we will the Lord willing if we get to it
[14:04] this afternoon we will pick up some of
[14:07] the things and my point today now don't
[14:10] get down we will read down to they
[14:13] without us cannot be made perfect but
[14:15] just hold that point and don't get on to
[14:18] that until maybe the Lord willing this
[14:21] afternoon all right but get to point of
[14:24] what I'm talking
[14:26] about that a positive attitude
[14:30] you
[14:31] know and all of the people in the Bible
[14:34] had that positive attitude you know
[14:39] these Warriors of faith and there is a
[14:42] quote brother random I got it on the
[14:43] desk there he said to think about all of
[14:46] these in Hebrews 11 and what they were
[14:49] and what they done and then think about
[14:52] ourselves and how little we are you know
[14:57] but now you know you know what I've
[14:59] tried to do and I've told you that I've
[15:02] Bend this away and you don't believe it
[15:04] that's all right cuz I I was praying
[15:07] yesterday and I thought Lord just get me
[15:09] on with preaching and forget all the
[15:12] other but from the time that I came in
[15:15] this message I saw these things in the
[15:18] Bible because I always um love to read
[15:22] the word all right and I studied the
[15:24] Bible you know before I came into the
[15:27] message and uh then when it did it began
[15:30] to open up and I could see and I've
[15:33] always had this positive attitude I mean
[15:37] even you know yourself you call me up on
[15:38] the phone and I'm dying I'm hurting I'm
[15:41] and this how you doing
[15:43] wonderful then wife says well what are
[15:45] you going to tell the doctor so I'm
[15:46] going to the doctor today and he says
[15:47] what's wrong with you are I'm
[15:49] wonderful I'm feeling great well I'm
[15:52] telling it like it is so I had to start
[15:54] telling the doctor said Doctor I'm doing
[15:55] wonderful feeling great oh but I got a
[15:58] headache can you get rid of it you know
[16:00] help me to do that you know or this is
[16:02] hurting or that but see now you'll be
[16:06] the point I want in a minute is to get
[16:08] something across to us about all of
[16:11] these that we're talking about but a
[16:15] very positive attitude and I've always
[16:17] had that about this message I've never
[16:19] been down about the message I've never
[16:22] had you know the wowy wowy Woos as
[16:26] brother fory says people do I've always
[16:29] been in an upbeat State about the
[16:32] message if anybody can show me I've been
[16:35] down I would like for you to speak up
[16:37] now I'm human hey yeah I do have a lot
[16:42] of downs and when you do have a positive
[16:46] attitude most people will never know it
[16:48] but you will have more Downs than people
[16:50] who don't have a positive attitude all
[16:54] right because you're going to be
[16:56] attacked on every hand
[16:59] right but you know yourself from the
[17:01] time that I've come that most of you
[17:02] have known me over 40 years going in
[17:05] towards 50 years that you know that I've
[17:08] always had one thing and that's driving
[17:11] to try to get the people to see who they
[17:16] are the first sermon here in 1971 July
[17:20] the 4th going Beyond man's
[17:23] camp that was what I preached on for us
[17:26] to go on forget all these other things
[17:29] quit running around horb you remember
[17:32] don't run around horb and just stay
[17:34] there let's go on in we've got a lot of
[17:36] wonderful things and we're going to talk
[17:38] about the the promise of the Bride or
[17:40] the bride's promises or our our our
[17:44] things because if we don't recognize the
[17:47] day that we're living see and most
[17:49] people take that recognizing your day
[17:51] and its
[17:52] message what do they say brother Rand
[17:54] was a prophet brother R was a prophet he
[17:56] brought the message we got the message
[17:57] we got the that's wonderful
[17:59] but what part of the message are we
[18:01] that's right well my part of the message
[18:04] just believe brother randam was part of
[18:05] the
[18:07] message well I mean we know that the
[18:10] devil knows
[18:12] that but what about your
[18:14] part you remember all these years we've
[18:17] been talking about
[18:19] that even
[18:22] Pentecost that brother randam said
[18:24] represented Mary but said they were only
[18:27] carriers
[18:30] but he said somebody's got to come back
[18:32] to the grain we'll get to that at the
[18:33] end of the message Lord will it see
[18:35] we've got to be the grain that went into
[18:37] the ground not just be a
[18:39] carrier you say yeah but I just don't
[18:41] understand because look like you know
[18:44] this would be that way this way what
[18:46] kind of a world do you think you're
[18:47] living in I mean you think this is going
[18:48] to be a flowy bed of ease and we're
[18:50] going out of here of a great hoopla I
[18:53] believe there will be a
[18:55] hoopla I've been in a Revival ever since
[18:58] I've been in in this message cuz I've
[19:00] never had a downtime in this message of
[19:04] not being in a Revival and it may be
[19:06] that I might go three months before the
[19:09] Lord speaks to me about something but
[19:11] I'm still up about it and I'm more up
[19:13] then than I am when he's speaking to me
[19:17] constantly because I know the devil is
[19:20] trying to hinder me from getting
[19:22] something so I just keep laying right in
[19:25] there cuz that's the that's me now and I
[19:28] I I'm just that way and that that's the
[19:30] way that I want to
[19:32] be because I want to have a positive
[19:35] attitude you know and and stay in that
[19:38] point but what is a positive attitude
[19:41] that's the reason I've been taking all
[19:43] of these of the Warriors of Faith you
[19:47] know and to see what their positive
[19:49] attitude
[19:51] was and when then the Lord willing if we
[19:54] get to it this afternoon if we don't we
[19:55] get next week we're not
[19:57] worry uh we'll get down to talking about
[20:00] they without
[20:02] us can not be made
[20:05] perfect all right so then they're
[20:08] waiting on you and I brother R said to
[20:11] the church is waiting on you and I those
[20:13] that have died and went on waiting on
[20:14] you and I adoption time he said when God
[20:17] can pour in his fullness and there be a
[20:20] resurrection and there'll be a
[20:22] Rapture why can't we believe
[20:27] that and look for forward to it instead
[20:30] of being and I know I was talking with
[20:32] Brother Gary the other day at the
[20:34] hospital there about it I've talked to
[20:36] you about it I've tried to preach to you
[20:38] that the world today see there's no more
[20:42] advancements we've gone to the Moon
[20:44] we've gone to this we've gone to that
[20:46] and it's just kind of the world is down
[20:48] the only thing they doing now is killing
[20:50] each
[20:51] other right I mean they're just working
[20:53] on killing each other they ain't working
[20:55] on trying to go up and do this or do
[20:58] that because we've done achieved the
[21:00] things that would represent the prophet
[21:02] said that interplanetary travel would
[21:05] represents the Rapture all right or
[21:08] going to the moon or whatever the
[21:09] statement he was making on that because
[21:12] that's the point that we're to do but
[21:14] somebody's got to do that right well we
[21:17] can keep on dying if you want
[21:20] to I mean you just keep on doubting and
[21:24] dying cuz that's what's keeping us here
[21:27] that's right I thought death was The
[21:29] Last Enemy to be destroyed I thought
[21:32] somebody would look at death and life at
[21:35] it but see I've watched this for now 20
[21:38] 30 years in the people of the message
[21:39] especially it's just kind of
[21:42] down have you noticed very new doctrines
[21:45] that even started in the past 10 years
[21:49] even wrong doctrines very few
[21:53] started and just kind of flattened out
[21:57] you know going to church church and
[21:59] being good and doing this and building
[22:02] churches and things you know
[22:07] well I'm not at that point I've never
[22:10] got that down
[22:12] yet I look forward every
[22:15] day to the things that God will make
[22:19] known to you and I all right let's read
[22:23] these Warriors of faith that we won't
[22:25] take time to cover we make comment upon
[22:28] a few few of them but go ahead with
[22:30] Hebrews 11 and we'll start with 17
[22:33] picking up on
[22:35] Abraham and try to read pretty fast but
[22:37] I want you to see what each one of these
[22:40] is doing and then like the prophet said
[22:42] then look at what we are well all these
[22:45] are to give us the the thing because all
[22:47] of these now we'll get back to in a
[22:49] message eventually all of these in
[22:52] Hebrews
[22:54] 11 are warriors of the Old Testament
[22:57] faith
[22:59] it only speaks
[23:01] of there's only one time brother around
[23:03] uses it in that form it only speaks in
[23:06] the Statue of a perfect man that he
[23:07] backs up a little bit but then he comes
[23:09] over into the
[23:12] bride and the bride to be waiting but
[23:15] all of these are really Old Testament
[23:18] people you know without the new
[23:24] birth right
[23:29] come
[23:30] on but yet they
[23:32] achieved that's
[23:35] right and see I want you to think about
[23:39] it and Heaven helped me to try to get
[23:42] this point to
[23:44] you we'll cover it in a minute we tried
[23:46] to cover it everybody wants to build on
[23:49] Abraham and Abraham was a warrior of
[23:51] faith and never doubted and Sarah she
[23:53] just doubted the whole time well now I
[23:55] want you to show me in the Bible
[23:59] where Sarah doubted other than the one
[24:01] time that's
[24:03] right and you know what Abraham was
[24:06] doubting before she doubted I want you
[24:08] to show me that in the
[24:09] Bible that's right and I I'll tell you
[24:12] this when before we get into it in case
[24:13] I miss it in the Old Testament the name
[24:16] SRA is s a r a in the New Testament the
[24:20] word is used s a r a for SRA just in
[24:25] case you get into trying to to run
[24:27] something to do but all right
[24:30] listen by faith Abraham when he was
[24:32] tried offered up Isaac he that receiv
[24:34] received the promise offered up his only
[24:36] begotten son of whom it was said that in
[24:38] Isaac shall thy seed be called
[24:40] accounting that God was able to raise
[24:41] him up even from the dead from whence
[24:44] also he received him in a figure Now by
[24:48] faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau
[24:51] concerning things to come see you could
[24:54] you could stop on each one of
[24:56] these script scriptures and preach for a
[25:00] week or two on them taking what happens
[25:03] but you are supposed to by now at least
[25:06] have a background Foundation enough
[25:09] about these that are in the Bible that
[25:11] you've read about to be able to
[25:13] understand a little so we don't have to
[25:15] back up and just get on each one Al that
[25:17] would be wonderful to
[25:19] do
[25:21] see all right by faith
[25:24] Jacob when he was dying blessed both the
[25:26] sons of Joseph and were worshiped
[25:29] leaning upon the top of his ti so you
[25:31] could take each one as to why it speaks
[25:35] of
[25:36] that and see that was their positive
[25:40] attitude right amen you understand amen
[25:44] that was their positive attitude by
[25:46] faith
[25:47] Joseph when he died made mention did
[25:50] listen Jacob and he was dying bless the
[25:52] sons of Joseph and worshiping all right
[25:54] by faith Joseph when he died made
[25:56] mention of the departing of the children
[25:58] of is Israel and gave commandment
[25:59] concerning his bones he said don't leave
[26:01] him down here so you could preach all of
[26:03] that him going down there and coming out
[26:06] look by faith Moses when he was born was
[26:09] hid three months of his parents because
[26:11] they saw he was a proper child and they
[26:14] were not afraid of the king's
[26:15] commandment by faith Moses when he come
[26:18] to years refused to be called a son of
[26:20] Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to
[26:23] suffer Affliction with the people of God
[26:26] than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[26:27] season
[26:28] esteeming the reproaches of Christ
[26:30] greater riches than the treasures in
[26:32] Egypt for he had respect unto the
[26:34] recompense of the reward by faith he
[26:37] forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of
[26:40] the king for he endured as seeing him
[26:43] who is invisible through faith he kept
[26:46] the Passover and the sprinkling of the
[26:48] blood lest that lest he be he that
[26:53] destroyed the firstborn should touch
[26:55] them by faith they passed through the
[26:58] Red Sea as by dry ground see each one of
[27:01] these you could stop on right with the
[27:03] Egyptians are saying to do were drown by
[27:07] faith the walls of Jericho now you jump
[27:09] into who Joshua right walls of Jericho
[27:12] coming over all right by faith the walls
[27:14] of Jericho fell down after they were
[27:16] compassed about for seven days by faith
[27:19] the Rahab Harlot perish not with them
[27:21] that believe not when she received the
[27:24] spies with peace and what shall I say
[27:27] more for the time would fail me to tell
[27:29] of Gideon and of Baro and of Samson and
[27:33] of jeepy or how you pronounce it je of
[27:36] David also in Samuel and of the prophets
[27:40] watch who through faith subdued kingdoms
[27:42] wrought righteousness obtained promises
[27:45] stopped the mouths of
[27:46] lions quenched the violence of fire
[27:49] escaped the edge of the sword out of
[27:51] weakness were made strong wax Violet and
[27:54] fight turned to flight the alien the
[27:56] armies of the aliens
[27:59] women received their dead raised in life
[28:01] again and others were tortured not
[28:04] accepting Deliverance that they might
[28:06] obtain a better resurrection and others
[28:08] had trials see you could stop on each
[28:10] one make a sermon of each one and
[28:13] determine what that's speaking of all
[28:15] right but we're trying to get to the
[28:17] point and others had trial of cruel
[28:19] mockings and scorching yay moreover and
[28:22] bonds and imprisonment uh let me let me
[28:24] start right here and say something um I
[28:28] meant to say it to start with but you
[28:32] that are on the
[28:35] platform you are on
[28:40] internet so I would behave as on
[28:45] internet I sit back in the office and
[28:48] see some of you while brother col is
[28:50] reading the scriptures you're walking
[28:52] around you're doing things you're
[28:53] feeling things you're
[28:57] doing that's not
[28:59] good I thought we were supposed to
[29:01] respect somebody reading the Bible I
[29:04] thought I've seen you even walking
[29:06] around doing things while brother collie
[29:08] or brother Mark is
[29:15] praying now that don't not be
[29:18] done right right that shouldn't be done
[29:22] out there that's right right we should
[29:25] honor praying
[29:28] maybe that's why God's not hearing your
[29:30] prayers okay brother Dale get out of it
[29:33] go on I said I was going to do it I'll
[29:35] just flop it in from now on Let It Go
[29:37] and others had trial of cruel mockings
[29:39] and scourging yay more of a bonds and
[29:42] imprisonment they were stoned they were
[29:44] sown aund were tempted were slain with a
[29:47] sword they wandered about in sheep skins
[29:49] and goat skins being destitute Afflicted
[29:52] tormented of whom the world was not
[29:54] worthy they wandered in deserts and in
[29:56] mountains and in dens and and caves of
[29:58] the earth and these all having obtained
[30:01] a good report now I want you to follow
[30:03] that and hold it especially this
[30:05] afternoon having obtained a good
[30:09] report they made a report all right and
[30:12] they obtained it through
[30:15] faith they receive not the
[30:17] promise God having provided some better
[30:20] thing for us that they without us cannot
[30:22] be made perfect as I said we don't want
[30:25] to get down to that part
[30:29] because I want you to stay with me on
[30:38] thinking I think that we set our
[30:42] goals our standards or whatever you
[30:45] think
[30:47] about sometimes not high
[30:50] enough uh you know
[30:53] okay because honor respect as I were
[30:56] saying about praying and people reading
[30:58] the Bible and people walking around and
[31:00] doing things and if I was going to whip
[31:02] my kids I would reach over with a spoon
[31:04] and tap that kid while the Bible's being
[31:07] read or somebody's
[31:09] praying because that can be
[31:11] disrespectful all right now but the
[31:15] point that I want to
[31:17] make is we set our goal sometimes too
[31:20] low that's all
[31:22] right we set our goal sometimes too high
[31:26] I've been around in this message now
[31:28] going on to 50 years and I've watched
[31:30] this point that most of the people in
[31:33] the message
[31:35] today when you speak of a Rapture or a
[31:37] change it's just a bus pulling up or a
[31:40] date or a time or a season or something
[31:43] happening it's nothing to do with them
[31:47] personally it's just something they're
[31:49] depending upon just like uh Muhammad to
[31:53] get on a white horse and ride the world
[31:55] all right
[31:58] yeah and and my point is one
[32:01] thing if we can't recognize who we
[32:06] are then we don't have a
[32:11] position it's not for
[32:14] us but if we can recognize who we are
[32:17] and what's taking place I thought that
[32:20] we believe that we were the end time
[32:22] people you
[32:24] know I thought we believe that I thought
[32:28] We Believe The Prophet's message spoke
[32:30] of
[32:31] us but see everybody thinks it only
[32:33] speaks of
[32:35] him all right sure it speaks of him
[32:38] because he was the one brought the
[32:39] message it spoke of Paul it spoke of
[32:42] Peter it spoke of all of them but it
[32:44] spoke of all of these that we just read
[32:46] of Warriors of
[32:48] faith if any one of them had not
[32:51] achieved in their life the thing that
[32:54] God promised for them to do you and I
[32:57] wouldn't be here today today that's
[33:02] right boy no because you would be taking
[33:05] out part of the word that's
[33:08] right that's right and you can't leave
[33:10] out part of the word and expect it to
[33:12] come forth perfect that's
[33:16] right all right then we've got our place
[33:19] we got something to
[33:21] do it's not to go to church be good
[33:23] claim to believe the message read a book
[33:26] every day that's one
[33:29] wonderful but to recognize who you
[33:33] are you remember the Welch Revival man a
[33:36] police officer and the guy went over
[33:37] there a little cop standing there I I
[33:40] want to know where the Welch Revival at
[33:42] he said you're looking at
[33:45] it
[33:47] well when are we going to get to the
[33:49] place that you're looking at the
[33:51] word but yet we make it so big we can't
[33:54] attain unto
[33:55] it and then some make it so small till
[33:58] you just fall into it I don't agree with
[34:02] either way that's
[34:05] right I believe we need to find our own
[34:08] salvation the Bible says with fear and
[34:13] trembling and not just talk about
[34:15] Abraham and Sarah and David and the
[34:18] things and think we got it oh we we
[34:21] understand we understand more than all
[34:22] them other people cuz we don't know
[34:23] about these things these these secret
[34:26] things that's in the Bible where those
[34:28] secret things change you and
[34:32] I the Mysteries was
[34:34] preached 40 something years
[34:37] ago is that
[34:39] right is there any new Mysteries but you
[34:42] know what everybody wants every once in
[34:44] a while and I'm not throwing off on I'm
[34:46] just playing all right every once in a
[34:48] while they'll find some new tapes that
[34:50] they didn't know
[34:51] existed everybody wants them cuz there's
[34:55] going to be something on there there's
[34:56] where it's at
[35:01] yeah it's going to be the entire
[35:04] message but think about
[35:09] it God promised
[35:15] sah that she would bring forth a child
[35:20] yes now as I said we spent all of our
[35:23] time talking about the great warrior of
[35:26] Faith Abraham and that's good
[35:29] all right and there was a believing in
[35:31] Abraham when Sarah probably couldn't
[35:34] believe or didn't
[35:37] believe but you never see her going
[35:39] against
[35:44] Abraham okay we got some quotes where
[35:46] the Prophet said Lot's wife said she was
[35:48] out there doing this that and the other
[35:50] said but it's not so for
[35:52] sah she followed right along with
[35:54] Abraham everywhere he was going
[35:58] and even though lot went into the Great
[36:00] Plains of Sodom and the wonderful thing
[36:03] Abraham went over on the hillside and
[36:06] Sarah went with
[36:12] him you see that's what I was trying to
[36:14] get out way told me the other day he
[36:15] said Daddy you better go through that
[36:16] again said them people ain't
[36:17] understanding
[36:19] you he's probably out in Colorado today
[36:22] talking about
[36:25] it to understand we put the
[36:28] emphasis upon
[36:30] Abraham like Sarah had nothing and
[36:32] Abraham took it and give it to her
[36:34] finally convinced her of
[36:36] it oh she met
[36:42] God she wound up with her own private
[36:48] experience personal experience and
[36:51] became a great warrior of Faith right
[36:57] but we look at it
[36:59] like well she ain't too much of a
[37:01] warrior of
[37:03] Faith well what about the one we just
[37:06] read about Rahab the
[37:08] Harlot you know I mean can I call her a
[37:10] and get by with it you know I'm
[37:12] not supposed to but Rahab to
[37:19] harlot you know what she just let some
[37:22] guys down a
[37:23] rope and save their
[37:26] lives but is wrote in the Bible that
[37:30] she had a positive attitude about God in
[37:35] his ways and his doings that's right yes
[37:41] sir now I don't believe she went on
[37:43] being a prostitute now I never believed
[37:45] that cuz I'm too far and too old I don't
[37:49] believe that
[37:51] when which one of Mary Magdalene kept on
[37:53] doing prostitute for a living I don't
[37:55] think so that's right
[37:58] things got changed sir
[38:02] right but now
[38:05] listen there's only one verse in the
[38:10] Bible in the book of Hebrew Hebrews
[38:12] about sah you know I'm talking about
[38:14] that or the warrior of faith I'm talking
[38:17] about where that she was able to
[38:19] conceive seed and
[38:24] things we see Abraham
[38:27] was doubting God after even his name had
[38:31] been changed from Abram to
[38:35] Abraham he falls on his face and lifs
[38:39] when God says you're going to have a
[38:44] child and he gets up and he says Lord
[38:47] forgive me for lifing but would you mind
[38:48] just taking ishmail and letting him be
[38:51] the
[38:52] promise come on is that right
[39:01] it's got to be somewhere close to the
[39:03] time of them being turned back to a
[39:05] young man and a young woman because his
[39:07] name is changed and and then you got a
[39:09] basically about a year of of lapping
[39:12] backwards and forth
[39:15] there and yet he's laughing at God and
[39:18] God says Ishmael is not going to be the
[39:22] promise that it's going to come true sah
[39:25] he really does get Almighty life
[39:29] in cuz he done live with Sarah all those
[39:32] years and there was no
[39:35] children
[39:37] right but see he
[39:41] doubted oh now brother you got it wrong
[39:45] what have you
[39:46] got according to the scriptures he
[39:49] laughed he doubted God and actually
[39:53] tried to uh Finagle a away that he could
[39:56] get to to come through
[40:01] ish
[40:05] right but you see when God wrote of
[40:11] him that's what he
[40:13] done right right true never stop God
[40:18] from going on and doing the things
[40:20] meeting with him Chang his name turn him
[40:22] back to a young man
[40:28] and after all of that's
[40:31] done he wants to give his wife
[40:38] away when you read what he
[40:43] done you see a lot of doubt and
[40:46] problems more than actually recorded as
[40:50] Sarah because she only had one time she
[40:52] doubt it
[40:55] right but see we don't want to mention
[40:57] Sarah we want to talk about the great
[40:59] warrior of Faith Abraham
[41:05] wonderful
[41:08] right but see
[41:12] sah she hears from God
[41:18] also
[41:22] right well Abraham explained it to her
[41:25] well okay let's read a couple of
[41:26] scriptures if I don't get through I'll
[41:28] finish up this this evening and go on
[41:30] something more to El Genesis 17
[41:34] brother let's read
[41:38] it all
[41:40] right so this is in the name changing
[41:42] period of time because Abraham Abram's
[41:45] been changed to Abraham but sah is still
[41:48] sah and she gets a sah all
[41:51] right God said unto Abraham as far as
[41:54] Sarah thy wife I shalt not call her name
[41:56] Sarah but but I can't never get that say
[41:59] right or say raw I don't know which way
[42:00] it goes you know you just pronounce it
[42:04] shall her name be I will bless
[42:07] her now this is when it gets on over
[42:10] into the
[42:12] situation that a lot of things has taken
[42:15] place and Abraham is still having
[42:16] problems he gets his name changed he
[42:18] still got
[42:19] problems cuz he really don't know where
[42:21] the child is coming from cuz God has not
[42:24] explained it to
[42:26] him so he thought it might be
[42:30] ishma
[42:31] right so God actually now said okay hold
[42:35] on a minute I will bless her talking
[42:38] about Sarah and give her a son give thee
[42:42] a son also of her y bless her and she
[42:44] shall be a mother of Nations Kings of
[42:47] people shall be of
[42:49] her then Abraham fell on his face and
[42:52] laughed and said in his heart now in his
[42:56] heart God reading that part not out loud
[43:00] we laugh at Sarah just you know we say
[43:03] sah snigger just a little and it says
[43:06] here that Abraham in his
[43:08] heart fell upon his face and laughed and
[43:10] said in his heart shall a child be born
[43:13] unto him that is 100 years old and shall
[43:16] sah that is 90 years old bear and
[43:20] Abraham said unto God oh that ish see
[43:23] he's got him already in the workings my
[43:27] live before thee and God said Sarah thy
[43:30] wife shall bear thee a son indeed and
[43:33] thou shalt call his name Isaac and I
[43:35] will establish my Covenant with him for
[43:37] an Everlasting Covenant and with his
[43:40] seed after him as for Ishmael I have
[43:43] heard and all do but my Covenant will
[43:45] establish with Isaac which Sarah shall
[43:48] bear unto thee at this set time in the
[43:52] next
[43:53] year all right
[44:00] God is speaking to sah telling it's
[44:03] going to come through
[44:06] SRA
[44:08] now as I said we put the emphasis upon
[44:10] Abraham if it wasn't for Abraham s would
[44:13] be in trouble
[44:15] okay we know that cuz she got
[44:18] killed right all
[44:21] right but now we see that God's made the
[44:24] promise to bring it to sah so without
[44:26] sah
[44:27] Abraham can't get
[44:32] Isaac that's what way said you better
[44:34] explain that good daddy cuz they're not
[44:36] getting
[44:39] it all
[44:42] right we talk about without Abraham it
[44:44] couldn't have been done but now we look
[44:46] at it that without
[44:48] Sarah it couldn't be done
[44:57] now remember to Abraham it was
[45:01] said and to thy
[45:04] seed
[45:05] right all right
[45:09] now
[45:11] swallow all right you swallowed you got
[45:13] to B go up where you can
[45:17] listen do you know that according to the
[45:23] Bible are you awake listening now
[45:28] Sarah was more the Seed of Abraham than
[45:31] Isaac
[45:37] was that's what it said did you
[45:40] swallow are you
[45:45] listening Isaac was an
[45:50] offspring
[45:52] right Sarah wasn't an offspring
[45:57] Sarah was a part of
[46:03] Abraham
[46:04] oh so Sarah being a part of
[46:07] Abraham being in
[46:11] Abraham they become
[46:14] one I thought we believe that a husband
[46:17] and wife was to be one right I thought
[46:20] that's what we understood about the the
[46:22] tops and the
[46:24] Shadows that even though they're two
[46:26] different people they they become one is
[46:28] that
[46:32] scriptural we see then sah was more of
[46:36] the promised seed than Isaac right
[46:40] because without sah Isaac's not
[46:43] coming
[46:46] right yeah but I look at all the
[46:48] problems how about it in a minute we get
[46:50] down to the bride of Christ without the
[46:52] bride of Christ there is no way the
[46:54] promise can be made fulfilled in the
[46:55] last days that's right that's right
[46:57] that's right yes
[47:02] sir come
[47:07] on
[47:09] sah was the only
[47:13] way that Abraham was going to get
[47:19] Isaac
[47:22] why because God said it is that enough
[47:26] amen
[47:27] he said Sarah's going to have the child
[47:29] Sarah's going to have the baby
[47:33] Isaac Sarah was more of the promise than
[47:38] Isaac you so I don't really know about
[47:41] that now well then you don't know what a
[47:43] husband and wife I'm talking about a
[47:45] true husband and
[47:47] wife right a true husband and wife is
[47:49] the type of Christ in the church and I
[47:51] thought they were to be
[47:53] one I didn't know there was a him and a
[47:55] her and a third in all of this this
[48:01] stuff I thought a real husband and wife
[48:03] was the type of Christ in the
[48:05] church not every woman and man went down
[48:08] to the justice of peace or the preacher
[48:11] whoever those that are really
[48:15] one is that right in
[48:18] Adam was Eve taken from
[48:23] Adam then there had to be some other
[48:26] thing things take place before Abel got
[48:34] there Eve was part of
[48:39] Adam
[48:41] right you listen you'll get the whole
[48:45] story all
[48:47] right but see we want to look at it we
[48:49] only want that that s that Abraham is
[48:52] this and Sarah's a piece of hamburger
[48:55] meat or something Abraham's a go p a
[48:57] half steak
[49:07] or you said why are you bringing it out
[49:10] this way brother Dale there's got to be
[49:11] a reason my reason is one thing we're
[49:15] making this thing so big the people of
[49:19] this message has made the Rapture the
[49:21] change the things so high and mighty
[49:24] above until there no way that the human
[49:27] possibility of mankind could ever
[49:30] achieve unto
[49:31] it I've watched that 50 years almost
[49:35] now one day one
[49:40] day the Bible don't say that the Bible
[49:44] says
[49:46] today sir is the day of
[49:50] salvation for one of these days one of
[49:53] these days some brother in this message
[49:55] going to get it so what happens young
[49:57] guy comes along he gets the message he
[49:59] got a little move he's got a little pull
[50:01] he's going everybody runs after him
[50:02] don't
[50:04] they after while they find out he run
[50:06] out they run
[50:08] back
[50:12] right and I'm not against them because
[50:15] you know what I say I appreciate them
[50:17] for being that way cuz at least they got
[50:19] some move about them instead of the dead
[50:21] heads of the message that are sitting
[50:24] still in Lula Georgia waiting on nothing
[50:26] to take
[50:29] place I said Lula Georgia I didn't say
[50:31] nowhere's else I'm not preaching
[50:33] nowhere's
[50:36] else on one of these days I just don't
[50:40] see nothing going
[50:43] on we've had about four five six times
[50:47] the Dead's been raised we've had all
[50:49] forms of healings to take place among us
[50:52] but nobody talks about it
[51:06] right I think brother D you shouldn't be
[51:09] that way why shouldn't I be that way
[51:10] it's true right yeah but you're throwing
[51:13] off I'm not throwing off on you if
[51:15] you're lined up ain't no
[51:18] way you lined up running right I'm not
[51:21] talking about
[51:23] you right
[51:28] would you see people are saying though
[51:32] if you have the word at Lulu why not the
[51:34] signs and wonders and you never hear a
[51:36] word said about the dead being
[51:39] raised but you let the dead be raised
[51:41] right over
[51:42] here in this church it'll be in ever
[51:45] paper in this
[51:48] country you let the
[51:50] pope call back a dead person and to see
[51:54] if it ain't in the world news
[52:00] but yet we don't see things going
[52:06] on
[52:08] right what are we looking
[52:13] for I'm not looking for I'm looking at
[52:16] the promise of
[52:18] God I'm happy to be
[52:22] here and if I'm in jail tomorrow for
[52:24] preaching it I'll be happy to be in jail
[52:27] tomorrow that's no
[52:30] problem why because I know and
[52:37] realize that if you do get thrown in
[52:39] jail at least you stirred up a little
[52:42] problem
[52:48] right but you see we make it so
[52:54] big until it's unattainable
[53:01] we read the quote I've got it in the
[53:02] message to be later we read the quote
[53:05] where brother R says no leaven among her
[53:07] brings the fullness of the godhead
[53:08] bodily well if we can ever get rid of
[53:11] all of the leaven there was no when
[53:13] there's no leaven no leaven whatsoever
[53:16] no leav none wor so let sweet you know
[53:18] they done that you know they have that
[53:20] every year in their doings and that they
[53:23] they have a thing and they hide a little
[53:25] Le and the the lady has to get together
[53:28] and they have to hunt till they find a
[53:29] living and they take it out and burn it
[53:31] that's a ritual they go through in the
[53:33] Jewish
[53:35] Traditions finding the leaven because
[53:37] there no leaven to be among
[53:39] them you know well that's good we should
[53:43] sweep a house clean up do whatever this
[53:45] house okay amen and get rid of all the
[53:49] Le right but what I'd like for you to
[53:52] explain one thing to me and I know I'm
[53:55] sorry for being sarcastic IC arrogant
[53:57] hateful and an old
[54:00] dude but is it the
[54:04] truth the Bible speaks over in
[54:10] Exodus uh 12:19 I think it
[54:14] is it says there is to be no leaven
[54:16] among you for seven
[54:20] days and like I said they go through
[54:23] their house they literally sweep it
[54:26] clean it they have a good old spray
[54:30] cleaning you know
[54:33] that my wife the other day she got mad
[54:36] at me saying this but here she is going
[54:38] to the hospital she said we can't leave
[54:41] this house like
[54:42] this I look around and I don't see a
[54:45] thing
[54:47] wrong she said you start on that wall
[54:50] and you clean and I'll go here and her
[54:51] hurting like crazy and we clean the
[54:55] house we cleaned the
[54:57] walls she changed the beds we cleaned
[55:02] everything just cuz she's going the
[55:04] hospital and she want nobody to walk in
[55:06] and see
[55:09] it well now that was frantic for this
[55:12] that point what would it be if you knew
[55:15] that say we're going to have a certain
[55:16] way like the Jews had and they they
[55:19] literally the story is they literally
[55:22] somebody puts a little lean somewhere
[55:23] hides it all right they've got to search
[55:25] that house to clean it to the top to the
[55:27] bottom to find that leaven because
[55:29] that's their tradition because if they
[55:31] go any further it's
[55:36] death right it's death if you got a Le
[55:40] in
[55:41] there huh
[55:44] now as it said the scripture says
[55:47] there's no leav among them brother R
[55:48] said uh it's in paragraph 58 I think of
[55:52] the
[55:52] Rapture he says uh no Liv among you he
[55:57] said that represents seven Church
[56:05] ages do you know the way that God looked
[56:09] at Abraham he never saw his
[56:13] doubts and his frustrations and his
[56:16] problems and he never wrote of them you
[56:19] remember the prophets explained the
[56:21] obituary written by God about Abraham
[56:25] said no way said it said he staggered
[56:27] not at the promise of God never saw a
[56:30] thing he done well you know never saw a
[56:33] thing sah
[56:37] Done
[56:39] Right Sarah is the type of the church we
[56:41] read that in the minute
[56:45] right now look down through you seven
[56:47] Church
[56:50] ages I've watched this with the people
[56:52] of the message until it begins
[56:54] arrogantly hatefully sickly to me
[56:59] and could I make it any worse than that
[57:00] I don't know what would be the
[57:02] worst cuz everybody's always talking
[57:04] about the bad
[57:08] part
[57:10] right Luther's
[57:13] bad he wanted to kill the Jews he was a
[57:19] trinitarian well brother D you do too
[57:21] yeah but you always hear me talk about
[57:23] his fact of faith
[57:29] right now if there's no leaven among you
[57:31] and that represented seven Church ages
[57:33] then God had to be looking at the ages
[57:35] From a Different Light than mankind was
[57:38] looking at the ages or that you and I
[57:40] can read about
[57:42] it he was looking at it like he did with
[57:45] Abraham that he saw nothing in Abraham
[57:49] he saw nothing in sah he saw nothing in
[57:53] Rahab
[57:55] right you explain that one Rahab finally
[57:58] winds up and marries that Israeli
[58:01] General and out of there comes the seed
[58:03] of
[58:04] David right you explain that
[58:09] one but God didn't see
[58:13] that I thought we believed what he put
[58:15] in the sea of forgetfulness could never
[58:17] be remembered no more
[58:21] amen but we think as long as we can
[58:23] remember it he can remember it
[58:26] is that the guy you know standing up
[58:27] Lord thank you I've done this I fasted
[58:30] done and I'm not like that guy over
[58:34] there now he's all right over here right
[58:37] cuz he he done all those things but he
[58:39] not like that
[58:41] guy but what did that guy say just
[58:44] forgive me Lord who went home
[58:48] Justified now if there was no leav in
[58:51] the seven Church ages then why is there
[58:54] so much preaching about the wrong that
[58:56] was in the ages instead of the truth
[58:58] that was in the
[59:06] ages am I
[59:11] right could it be that the people are
[59:14] not seeing the way God
[59:16] sees
[59:18] right could it be that the preachers
[59:21] even in this message are not looking at
[59:23] it like brother Brandon was looking at
[59:24] it or that God was looking at
[59:30] it when he
[59:33] says I'll give it to you in a
[59:35] minute the godhead is not complete
[59:38] without
[59:43] you that's what your Prophet
[59:47] said say she's the fullness of the
[59:49] godhead
[59:52] bodily but you don't hear that preached
[59:59] what's the worst thing in the world is
[1:00:00] everybody wants you to tell wants you to
[1:00:02] speak good to them then you start trying
[1:00:04] to speak good to them to tell them about
[1:00:06] who they are and they don't want you to
[1:00:07] do that they'd rather you beat them over
[1:00:09] the toes and heads and and bodies and
[1:00:11] then they can go out the door boy that
[1:00:13] was a good message was man he beat me he
[1:00:15] told me right where I'm standing well
[1:00:17] why don't you sit down and shut up do
[1:00:20] something move amen right but
[1:00:24] no I'm the special
[1:00:27] one it can't be done without me and when
[1:00:31] I ever get it I'll tell you about
[1:00:37] it
[1:00:39] right well I wish you'd get it and tell
[1:00:42] me about it cuz I'm getting tired of
[1:00:43] being
[1:00:46] here
[1:00:51] right is that serious or is it straight
[1:00:57] but you see if God looked at the ages
[1:01:01] and put it in Exodus that there'd be no
[1:01:04] leav among the church for seven days the
[1:01:09] prophet said that would represent the
[1:01:10] seven Church ages so there's no living
[1:01:13] in the seven Church
[1:01:15] ages what Brother D says look what they
[1:01:18] done look what they that's not the
[1:01:23] bride read where it said to him him that
[1:01:27] overcometh that's in every Church
[1:01:34] age that's what I said wait said you
[1:01:36] better explain Sarah Daddy because the
[1:01:38] people are not
[1:01:40] listening without sah they would have
[1:01:43] been no
[1:01:44] Isaac without the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:01:48] there will be no
[1:01:53] Rapture right
[1:01:58] without
[1:02:00] you there is no
[1:02:06] God yeah but my little part well I got
[1:02:10] some fingernails I sure do love you when
[1:02:12] I
[1:02:13] itch right very small they're very handy
[1:02:18] when I need
[1:02:20] them right I've never figured out yet
[1:02:23] why you got herir in your nose they say
[1:02:25] it's to filter everything but I have
[1:02:27] more trouble with that than
[1:02:29] anything but you know what they're there
[1:02:30] for a
[1:02:32] reason
[1:02:37] right they say it's your appendix you
[1:02:40] can do totally without it will God give
[1:02:42] it to you for some reason one of these
[1:02:44] days they'll come up with the idea and
[1:02:45] say wait a minute we found out all of
[1:02:47] these diseases come because people had
[1:02:49] their appendix taking
[1:02:53] out yeah
[1:02:56] but you see Church
[1:02:59] listen talking about
[1:03:03] sah brother brand him in the message
[1:03:05] called Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:03:06] today and forever he's talking about lot
[1:03:09] and how that Lot's wife lived
[1:03:13] and there Sodom but he said that's not
[1:03:16] according to
[1:03:18] sah she lived the way she wanted
[1:03:22] to are you reading
[1:03:24] it no she lived the way she wanted to
[1:03:28] she was very popular woman now he's
[1:03:30] falling back to who you can take that to
[1:03:33] go to both of them Lot's wife lived the
[1:03:36] way she wanted to Sarah lived the way
[1:03:37] she wanted to go back to with it all but
[1:03:39] look but not Sarah she was up there with
[1:03:42] her husband she was called out sealed
[1:03:46] Away by a promise that she was going to
[1:03:49] have a visitation from God a son was
[1:03:53] coming
[1:03:56] so has the sah typed church today called
[1:04:00] out of Sodom with a waiting
[1:04:03] promise of his coming
[1:04:07] son don't sound like
[1:04:09] that sah just don't amount to
[1:04:13] nothing sir as we would see Jesus just
[1:04:16] keep pulling him up be number four he's
[1:04:18] talking about Lot's wife and how she
[1:04:21] was then he says but sah was the most
[1:04:24] beautiful woman in all the world girl
[1:04:26] and she took her choice with her husband
[1:04:29] and lived that there on the poor of the
[1:04:31] land so she could serve God in the air
[1:04:35] of the
[1:04:36] promise says what a
[1:04:39] difference we want to throw off on all
[1:04:42] of the things you know what if I would
[1:04:44] have been
[1:04:47] sah I know you're going to hate me go
[1:04:50] ahead if I'd have been sah I'd have told
[1:04:52] that King hey boy we're going the other
[1:04:54] way kill that old guy and get him out of
[1:04:56] the way cuz he ain't done nothing but
[1:04:57] give me away two
[1:04:59] times and I can go with you and I own
[1:05:02] the
[1:05:03] world you're the king I'm the
[1:05:08] queen
[1:05:10] right but Sarah wouldn't that way she
[1:05:14] wasn't that kind of a
[1:05:16] woman right why because she typed the
[1:05:18] bride of
[1:05:19] Christ sah restoration of the Bride
[1:05:23] tree sah type of the Church the true
[1:05:27] church the Free Church the free woman
[1:05:29] with a free child type of the Born Again
[1:05:32] Church with the
[1:05:36] promise what about the promises to you
[1:05:39] and
[1:05:42] I sure as we would see
[1:05:47] Jesus that we're living in a day that
[1:05:49] the Gospel made many great promises for
[1:05:53] this day now now is this is those
[1:05:58] promises
[1:06:01] true and if they are true then we should
[1:06:05] live by
[1:06:06] them and if they're not true we should
[1:06:10] get away from them and find out what is
[1:06:16] true so then you ought to realize what
[1:06:19] brother Dale been pointing at for all
[1:06:20] these
[1:06:21] years is a people that would finally get
[1:06:24] down to believing who they are
[1:06:26] yes and stand on
[1:06:31] it CU if not let's get away from it
[1:06:34] let's find some who you do to
[1:06:37] follow let's get a rabbit and hat let's
[1:06:39] get
[1:06:40] something let's start the victory march
[1:06:43] I thought about that I thought I love
[1:06:44] these kids and I them kids they come
[1:06:47] walking down to here they the little
[1:06:49] ones be singing this after you know what
[1:06:50] I want to come down yeah will I'm still
[1:06:53] as a kid I i' love this
[1:06:57] said why because they're kids and we
[1:07:00] just all
[1:07:02] kids but think about it if it's not true
[1:07:05] let's get away from
[1:07:08] it I've never said anything about
[1:07:10] anybody leaving this
[1:07:11] church it's up to
[1:07:15] you right that's your choice I've never
[1:07:18] said anything about you coming that's
[1:07:21] your
[1:07:22] choice
[1:07:23] right all right the presence of God
[1:07:29] unrecognized so many things look in this
[1:07:34] days what he said would take
[1:07:39] place look at the promises that he made
[1:07:43] would take place this day and then
[1:07:46] examine
[1:07:47] it of what is going
[1:07:51] on and see where we're at then you see
[1:07:54] where he is still in his word or
[1:08:00] not they wanted to see the sign of Moses
[1:08:03] the sign of
[1:08:04] David that was not their age it was
[1:08:07] promised for moses' age and them age the
[1:08:11] promise for this age has to come to
[1:08:16] pass he had clearly showed
[1:08:19] them he by the scripture invited them to
[1:08:23] search the scripture to see what day
[1:08:25] they were living in he doing the same
[1:08:27] thing right now search for scripture you
[1:08:30] who believe the
[1:08:32] Bible what is supposed to take place
[1:08:35] right here before his
[1:08:37] coming all right Feast of the
[1:08:40] trumpets remember God is the word and
[1:08:44] each age has lotted the word for that a
[1:08:46] for each age that would be on earth he
[1:08:49] lotted it in the church age and the
[1:08:51] Seven Seals revealed every bit of it
[1:08:54] promises
[1:08:56] for you and
[1:08:58] I God's only provided place of
[1:09:01] worship no leaven among you that brings
[1:09:05] the entire fullness of the godhead
[1:09:06] bodily among
[1:09:10] you now see we like to read the rest of
[1:09:13] that in a in a negative form couldn't do
[1:09:15] it in the days of Luther age do it in
[1:09:18] Luther's age couldn't do it in Wesley
[1:09:20] age couldn't do it in Pentecostal age
[1:09:22] that's
[1:09:24] right but does that mean they wouldn't
[1:09:26] part of it I want to read one in just a
[1:09:28] minute cuz you know the quote where
[1:09:30] brother R says that God isn't complete
[1:09:32] without you well you know God isn't
[1:09:34] complete without
[1:09:35] Luther you know God isn't complete
[1:09:38] without Wesley you know God isn't
[1:09:40] complete without a zeusa street
[1:09:42] Pentecostal people that really had to
[1:09:45] genuine but we only want to make see
[1:09:47] that's what I said we make it too much
[1:09:49] this way are we it can't be attainable
[1:09:55] no leaven now remember my
[1:09:59] point so evidently God must be looking
[1:10:03] down at the ages not as we think he
[1:10:11] looks we want to take the seven Church
[1:10:14] age blind wretched miserable and naked
[1:10:16] you know it
[1:10:17] not but we don't see the first he
[1:10:20] says the beginning of the creation of
[1:10:23] God
[1:10:25] we don't see the promise of the
[1:10:26] Overcomer in this age as to inherit
[1:10:29] every Overcomer age before
[1:10:34] them we only want to look at the
[1:10:38] negative Wy Wy
[1:10:41] W if I could just see something take
[1:10:44] place I would believe it you lying
[1:10:49] hypocrite is that the best way I can say
[1:10:51] it
[1:10:58] but you see we're looking at things the
[1:10:59] way we want to look at it instead of the
[1:11:00] way God wants to look at God said
[1:11:02] there's no leing among the seven Church
[1:11:06] ages well he sure must be looking at the
[1:11:08] good side not the bad that's right
[1:11:12] right he surely had to be looking at
[1:11:15] Abraham the good side not the bad Sarah
[1:11:18] and the good side Rahab the Harlot the
[1:11:21] good side the David the lion sticking
[1:11:24] Rascal that was a m
[1:11:26] murer but he was a man after God's Own
[1:11:36] Heart yet we want to make it so perfect
[1:11:38] until it's
[1:11:43] unattainable I have no problems with
[1:11:45] seeing your
[1:11:48] problems the problems I have is when you
[1:11:50] won't do anything about your problems
[1:11:53] and you keep leaning back on your
[1:11:54] problems as a
[1:11:57] crutch you could at least say help me to
[1:12:00] get rid of this
[1:12:03] am I've never expected to find a church
[1:12:07] that everything would be perfect
[1:12:09] everybody would be just perfect just
[1:12:12] everything sitting just perfect and
[1:12:14] every move and I
[1:12:16] say Bri and everybody say hey
[1:12:21] man I told you about the time I was
[1:12:23] listening to a certain brother
[1:12:26] and he would say a few words and they'd
[1:12:29] be rejoicing well that's fine but then
[1:12:31] he'd say you may be seated
[1:12:36] now must have been a lot of people come
[1:12:38] in you know well in a minute he' say
[1:12:40] something they get rejoicing then he'd
[1:12:42] say you may be seated
[1:12:45] now well about six or eight times after
[1:12:47] he said that you know I finally figured
[1:12:49] it out that wasn't people coming in
[1:12:51] that's people jumping up about what he
[1:12:53] said I've never seen any of you jump up
[1:12:57] about what it
[1:12:58] said it was a surprise the other day
[1:13:01] when we were singing and the spirit of
[1:13:03] the Lord came in and two sisters stood
[1:13:05] up right over
[1:13:09] here that surprised
[1:13:17] me I don't expect to see a perfect
[1:13:20] church that there's no problems and
[1:13:22] heartaches and troubles that would be
[1:13:23] contrary to the scripture
[1:13:26] but I do expect to see a church that
[1:13:28] when God looks down he looks at the
[1:13:30] atonement and he doesn't see our false
[1:13:33] and failures and in his eyes we're
[1:13:36] perfect sir but never in the eyes of the
[1:13:40] people will we be
[1:13:44] perfect why can't we believe what he
[1:13:46] says about
[1:13:49] us look what he says on what was the
[1:13:52] Holy Ghost given for 1959 God's purpose
[1:13:55] we find here is sending the Holy
[1:13:58] Spirit was one purpose that God himself
[1:14:01] might dwell in his
[1:14:03] church and continue his plans through
[1:14:06] the
[1:14:07] church that God was in Christ continuing
[1:14:10] his plans through
[1:14:12] Christ out of Christ into the church
[1:14:15] continuing his work through the
[1:14:18] church drop down all that God was he
[1:14:21] poured into Christ because he emptied
[1:14:24] himself say it like this all that God
[1:14:27] was he's emptied he he poured it into
[1:14:30] Christ Christ was the fullness of the
[1:14:32] godhead bodily all that Jehovah was he
[1:14:35] poured into Christ and all that Christ
[1:14:37] was he poured into the church not into
[1:14:40] one
[1:14:43] individual brother random wasn't the
[1:14:44] fullness of the godhead bodily brother
[1:14:46] Dale's not the fullness of the godhead
[1:14:47] bod and you are not
[1:14:49] either I don't care who you are and what
[1:14:51] you
[1:14:53] think cuz this is what the the prophet
[1:14:55] said not into one individual but into
[1:14:58] the entire
[1:15:01] body right what about the next one lean
[1:15:04] not to your own understanding you know
[1:15:05] I've read this a lot to you I love it
[1:15:07] and the only way you can be a Son of God
[1:15:10] or a daughter of God you had to be a
[1:15:12] part of God and God isn't complete
[1:15:15] without
[1:15:16] you he has to be that's right because
[1:15:20] there's only one source of eternal
[1:15:23] life right
[1:15:27] look at the last one Mighty God
[1:15:29] unveil it was God in Christ God in man
[1:15:33] fullness of the godhead bodily in a man
[1:15:35] God in a man now it's God in men the
[1:15:38] fullness of the godhead fullness of God
[1:15:41] in the godhead bodily in his entire
[1:15:44] church manifesting himself fulfilling
[1:15:47] his
[1:15:50] word so we want to get away from Downing
[1:15:53] sah and start thinking about sah
[1:15:56] represents the bride she's my
[1:16:03] representation and get away from looking
[1:16:05] at our own faults and failures now
[1:16:08] here's where we got to say it
[1:16:11] plain he said well brother Dale I know I
[1:16:14] got faults and failures and I can't help
[1:16:16] it you just
[1:16:20] lied you just
[1:16:23] lied that's right yes sir I mean you're
[1:16:28] smoking and you can't quit just don't
[1:16:31] put one in your
[1:16:36] mouth yeah but I can't stand it all the
[1:16:38] well get rid of them
[1:16:43] demons is that
[1:16:47] right but you see we're wanting some
[1:16:50] rabbit in a hat trick to carry us out of
[1:16:53] here when we've had all these years of
[1:16:56] the word being revealed to us to try to
[1:16:59] get us to a place that we could believe
[1:17:01] who we
[1:17:02] are and what we're doing here was that
[1:17:05] what he said he said when the bride
[1:17:07] realizes who she is and what she's here
[1:17:09] for she'll be an invisable army yes sir
[1:17:14] amen Satan won't be able to handle
[1:17:21] her you see even job in all of his d
[1:17:27] and God called him a just and upright
[1:17:29] man yet when elue came to him which was
[1:17:31] a Christ he told job he said the only
[1:17:34] thing I see paraphrasing putting it
[1:17:36] together with what brother BR
[1:17:38] said he said job got just a little bit
[1:17:40] too exalted in his own self that's
[1:17:43] paraphrasing
[1:17:45] it he said that was really the only
[1:17:47] thing could be found wrong with
[1:17:51] job did he got just a little bit too
[1:17:54] righteous in his his own
[1:17:57] self see instead of depending upon the
[1:18:01] offering to make him
[1:18:03] righteous he was dependent upon not
[1:18:05] doing it made him
[1:18:08] righteous that won't work you're better
[1:18:11] off to go on and do it and then plead
[1:18:14] the
[1:18:16] blood people don't like that right cuz
[1:18:19] you say brother Dale okay and for you to
[1:18:21] go do it I did not say that you just
[1:18:24] lied
[1:18:26] I said it would be better to do
[1:18:29] it you know what brother rown said about
[1:18:33] polygamy he said America would be better
[1:18:35] off if they believed in it do you need
[1:18:38] that
[1:18:40] quote may be a paraphrase but it's
[1:18:45] our was he okay in prostitutions was he
[1:18:48] okay in polygamy and things no he was
[1:18:51] just telling it like it is
[1:18:59] we don't agree with these foreign
[1:19:02] countries oh we think the women over in
[1:19:05] in Iraq and this that or the other ought
[1:19:07] to be
[1:19:10] freed then you free them and make a
[1:19:12] bunch of prostitutes out of
[1:19:14] them
[1:19:20] yeah what would we be if brother Brown
[1:19:22] said where would it be if the women had
[1:19:25] to take a mergency test before they got
[1:19:27] married he said they do that in
[1:19:33] Africa I wonder how many weddings would
[1:19:40] be but you see church if we keep looking
[1:19:43] down on our own selves and looking down
[1:19:45] on everybody
[1:19:47] else we're not going to get
[1:19:51] nowhere you come and tell me and you
[1:19:53] know it's true a lot of you and said
[1:19:55] brother Dale I've had this problem I had
[1:19:56] this problem I said okay let's pray and
[1:19:58] get rid of that problem I don't come to
[1:20:00] the pull pit and explain
[1:20:02] it I'm not going to tell you who it is
[1:20:05] but a sister come to me and she's
[1:20:09] brownhead and wa so much but I'm not
[1:20:12] telling you her
[1:20:19] name no somebody tells you something and
[1:20:23] tells you not to tell it it's supposed
[1:20:25] to be kept a secret but of course we've
[1:20:27] got the good idea what if you tell the
[1:20:29] other you tell it somebody tells you and
[1:20:32] you say well okay it's a secret and you
[1:20:34] go out and tell them said now now

[1:20:36] but you don't tell nobody else if you do
[1:20:38] you tell them it's a
[1:20:41] secret Facebook I hate your
[1:20:45] Facebooks it has been proven over and
[1:20:47] over divorces and everything in the
[1:20:50] world is happening because of Facebook
[1:20:54] and yet you still read the
[1:20:56] garbage you know why because your mind
[1:20:59] wants to read
[1:21:02] garbage I mean me talking to somebody on
[1:21:04] a Facebook and they say I've got to go
[1:21:07] to the bathroom well I'd say put it on
[1:21:09] the world they got to go to the
[1:21:13] bathroom you know why Facebook and stuff
[1:21:15] are working cuz you're not looking at
[1:21:18] nobody I don't care if you're looking at
[1:21:20] a picture or whatever you're looking
[1:21:22] you're still concealed in the point but
[1:21:24] you can say what you want to because
[1:21:26] you're not looking eye to eye with the
[1:21:29] other
[1:21:30] person so you're not
[1:21:35] condemned you right here you got your
[1:21:39] Facebooks you know one thing for certain
[1:21:42] brother Dale's against
[1:21:46] it because you get on there and you
[1:21:49] talk and you know My Philosophy if you
[1:21:53] on the phone over 5 minutes you're
[1:21:58] gossiping if you're on Facebook over two
[1:22:01] seconds you
[1:22:02] are
[1:22:09] right come
[1:22:12] on you get on the computer you get on
[1:22:15] the things like that and you're looking
[1:22:17] at all that
[1:22:19] junk why
[1:22:28] well I want to know what so and shows do
[1:22:30] it
[1:22:33] you now you're just in a good old
[1:22:36] gossiper is brother who was it
[1:22:39] brother
[1:22:41] uh Jack Co it said that lady said I want
[1:22:44] to lay my tongue on the alar he said
[1:22:46] lady this this is just 14t across this
[1:22:48] platform so ain't enough
[1:22:51] room say that today and where are you
[1:23:01] right but do you see what I'm talking
[1:23:04] about God never looked down and saw
[1:23:06] Abraham's
[1:23:08] problems but he never saw sra's problems
[1:23:11] that's right he never saw the church
[1:23:14] ages in their problems Luther yes was a
[1:23:17] trinitarian yes
[1:23:19] Luther said the Jews ought to be took
[1:23:21] out and be killed because of Killing
[1:23:23] Jesus Christ they a lot of problems but
[1:23:26] you don't never hear the the point that
[1:23:28] that message he brought was so vital
[1:23:31] until it attacked the whole world of the
[1:23:34] just shall live by faith and you and I
[1:23:36] today are standing on what Luther taught
[1:23:40] if we are a
[1:23:43] Christian God don't see our faults and
[1:23:49] failures well then I can just go do what
[1:23:51] I want
[1:23:52] to I do what I want to to that's
[1:23:56] right right I do want to Sarah done what
[1:23:59] she wanted to did we read that she set
[1:24:02] up there with Abraham when she could
[1:24:03] have been down there you
[1:24:05] know
[1:24:09] right she could have stayed with two
[1:24:12] kings she had a double two
[1:24:15] kings but instead she went off with her
[1:24:19] lying
[1:24:20] husband who wanting to give her away
[1:24:26] but God don't write
[1:24:29] that in the New
[1:24:31] Testament he don't write about her
[1:24:34] problems he don't write about his
[1:24:36] problems he don't write about our
[1:24:38] problems he writes about who we
[1:24:42] are and what he hath made us and not we
[1:24:45] ourselves we are his people the Sheep of
[1:24:47] his
[1:24:49] Pastor
[1:24:51] right come on musicians let's stand
[1:24:56] think on these
[1:25:01] things if we keep looking at our faults
[1:25:03] and failures we'll never get
[1:25:06] nowhere but now if we keep making faults
[1:25:09] and failures we're not going to get
[1:25:11] anywhere come
[1:25:13] on so don't be R wishy washy and floppy
[1:25:17] floppy well brother Dale said it's all
[1:25:19] right for me to go do this I didn't say
[1:25:21] that
[1:25:24] you sin a sin as a Christian what did
[1:25:26] the prophet
[1:25:27] say do you need to quote he said you sin
[1:25:31] a sin as a Christian you'll reap a tub
[1:25:38] fool you go out here boys and get some
[1:25:41] little girl
[1:25:43] pregnant you got a baby to deal with the
[1:25:46] rest of your life
[1:25:51] right you'll live with that
[1:25:55] right you Reaper t for what we got
[1:25:59] brother 170 170 in
[1:26:03] spiral I'm sorry that I can't preach
[1:26:05] like these other brothers can to make
[1:26:07] you feel good and happy I make you feel
[1:26:10] bad but when we get over
[1:26:13] there you'll say thank
[1:26:16] you for telling me like it
[1:26:21] is God don't see our faults and fails he
[1:26:24] have to kill
[1:26:27] us that's why we got to have an
[1:26:30] advocate we got to have a
[1:26:34] comforter we will do
[1:26:40] wrong did the prophet said we don't
[1:26:42] really do wrong he said we make
[1:26:45] mistakes good way of saying it
[1:26:48] right cuz you don't want to do that but
