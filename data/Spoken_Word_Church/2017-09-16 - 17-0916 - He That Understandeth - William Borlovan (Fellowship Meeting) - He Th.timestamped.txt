[47:10] being here with you and the fellowship
[47:12] this afternoon it's just good being a
[47:14] how the Lord with us you know that's the
[47:16] main thing we come to serve and to
[47:18] worship Him I I'm just thankful for him
[47:21] and I like the song that brother Marty
[47:23] son Gaara living in the sunshine you
[47:26] know we're in a day that the sun's
[47:28] shining spiritual speaking we're in a
[47:31] day that we all look at til the world is
[47:33] dark and it's going to get darker and I
[47:35] think brother BAM said it's gonna get
[47:37] worse and worse until they tell the
[47:39] bride's took out you know and all these
[47:40] guys tribulations and so I'm looking
[47:42] from the bright side and the Word of God
[47:45] is so good to us in this hour I
[47:47] appreciate him that what he has done for
[47:49] me you know he allowed me to recognize
[47:51] one day I was a sinner
[47:53] Paul so Paul said he was cheap but Jesus
[47:56] come to save sinners and I'm starting to
[47:58] thankful he saved me and you know as I
[48:00] went along I come into the light of this
[48:02] word and even in time I'm just so
[48:04] thankful for it because it shines so
[48:06] bright and I think it was in song it
[48:09] marty was singing there we wonder why
[48:11] ribbon says you know and trying to do
[48:13] God's service without his will he says
[48:15] reason Ahab prospered and everything and
[48:18] had prophets and all he said he let
[48:20] their hearts to be to be hardened and
[48:22] that's why I lots of things taking place
[48:24] that people say why it's the difference
[48:25] in because the world's got to get hard
[48:27] to it but you know the bride she's got
[48:29] light to shine in a lot of the word is
[48:32] shining this hours and seven strengths
[48:34] the church ages down through the time we
[48:36] live in great time to live in and you
[48:38] know we can live as low as we want to
[48:40] and or as high as we want to what God
[48:42] has done to it and I'll just take just a
[48:44] few minutes okay but be alright and I
[48:46] thought you know my
[48:48] grandpa told me one time I was out with
[48:50] him in the woods he says Joe he says
[48:52] just don't look down
[48:54] he said it's more than looking just down
[48:57] where's jin-sang hung up in the
[48:59] mountains and he says look up
[49:02] he said because when you're looking down
[49:04] you can't see what's out there
[49:06] and he said just don't look out there he
[49:08] says look up he said these things down
[49:11] here he's things out turn these things
[49:13] up fire and I thought that's the way the
[49:14] Word of God is just don't look down
[49:16] where we had where we going what we see
[49:18] but use the Word of God is faith to pick
[49:20] us up and you talk about the stories in
[49:22] oh that's that's a good thing to go
[49:25] through ain't it to experience I think
[49:27] you know when I was a little kid my
[49:31] grandpa says you know we believe in God
[49:33] I didn't know what God was he trusts him
[49:35] airplane and I was thinking when I was a
[49:37] 5 year old boy you know how kids boys do
[49:41] they get out mama she worked and daddy
[49:43] has worked and I was all home by myself
[49:45] out of your own I was in the woods and
[49:48] come up a storm I says I'm gonna go out
[49:49] and get on her tree and watch it
[49:51] lightning I went out on a cedar tree and
[49:56] it was a lot in a thunder I said oh it
[49:58] makes me scared but it says trust in God
[49:59] that says oh my grandpa said I could
[50:02] trust in God so Isis got on there
[50:04] watching it lightning thunder says I'm
[50:06] trusting in God if I die I'm trusting in
[50:09] God if I live I'm trusting in God you
[50:11] know and I went through the storm and
[50:12] when I was got into teenagers
[50:15] I was in a service and we just going to
[50:19] go through a typhoon and we went into
[50:21] the typhoon and we stayed in a typhoon
[50:24] and we come out of typhoon I was 18 year
[50:29] old I thought oh I could die in here but
[50:33] the captain the ship he says it's made
[50:35] to go through the typhoons I said I hope
[50:38] he knows what he's talking about because
[50:40] I've never been here before you know
[50:42] that's the same way with us today we've
[50:44] never had this journey before but it's a
[50:47] bright day to just shine in and you just
[50:50] don't look down just don't look that way
[50:52] but look up because Jesus is here to
[50:54] come and get us and one of these days
[50:56] it's going to take place when we think

[55:52] you don't know who they are by now
[55:53] you're in bad shape I don't never do it
[55:56] brother Tony come on
[56:09] hey ma'am do you love Jesus I always
[56:16] think about him and I was thinking about
[56:20] him this morning how God is so great but
[56:24] I bomb say he's so great that he reveals
[56:28] himself in the flesh you know so I look
[56:31] back about 30 years ago and I brought a
[56:37] friend you know in vitamin C brother
[56:39] Tony just I was like at Lake you know
[56:42] come on let's visit my church one day
[56:46] you know so that's okay I'll visit so I
[56:50] follow him to the church they used to
[56:53] have it in the classrooms so I said what
[56:57] kind of church is it few people here and
[57:02] there I used to be in Saint Peter's
[57:04] Cathedral really big huge sit at the
[57:07] back there then the preacher man step
[57:12] beyond the pulpit and he said today
[57:14] we're gonna study the hybrid religion so
[57:19] what's that hybrid religion you know I
[57:24] said back and this guy started preaching
[57:28] recently came here to minister for us
[57:31] and he baptized me the same day then he
[57:35] kept preaching by Jesus and the Spirit
[57:40] of God
[57:41] I'll go can became flesh and different
[57:44] things everything lined up with the
[57:46] scriptures and I begin to cry you know
[57:48] so eventually by the end of the service
[57:51] I gave my life to Jesus already and I
[57:54] never went back to the nomination and
[57:57] ever since the Lord began to reveal
[58:00] himself you know he doesn't do it one
[58:02] day he's gradually you know you get to
[58:05] know him more the more you know him the
[58:09] more you love him
[58:10] it's it took a while sometimes take
[58:13] really some time and every single day I
[58:17] was really very shy person so I got a
[58:20] message gabab ties
[58:22] I was a businessman and I was going to
[58:25] our crime from my city to a crime and
[58:29] then take the balls to Lagos and I was
[58:35] in a big you know long boss a lot packed
[58:40] a lot of people and a voice spoke to me
[58:45] stand up and tell people about Jesus
[58:49] that was the hardest thing in my life
[58:53] how can I do it then I look at the
[58:57] people here what's a lot I can do this
[59:01] then I feel something like pulling me up
[59:05] and I stood up and you know I shared the
[59:11] Lord Jesus Christ to the people a little
[59:13] bit and I said how again it wasn't easy
[59:17] and it happened again when I was in the
[59:23] college the professor didn't come so we
[59:27] were there everybody talking talking
[59:29] about girlfriends and pains the same
[59:32] voice came again this time in the class
[59:35] I stood up and so I didn't understand
[59:38] why the Lord is doing that to me then it
[59:42] took a long time for me to realize that
[59:46] he's the same yesterday today and
[59:48] forever and if you have him in your
[59:51] heart and if you are predestinated you
[59:57] don't matter where you are so I really
[59:59] want to thank the Lord this morning
[1:00:00] they'll all give me a little scripture
[1:00:02] in Romans chapter 9 and I felt like okay
[1:00:08] I'll share that Scripture Romine chapter
[1:00:11] 9 verses 29 and it says i said the lord
[1:00:15] of the sabbath has left us a seed we
[1:00:19] would have been like this Sodom so the
[1:00:22] scripture really strike me hard and I
[1:00:25] was thinking about Jesus he gave us
[1:00:29] Jesus and a seed the royal seed of
[1:00:34] Abraham
[1:00:35] there has kept all of us except that all
[1:00:40] of us would have been lost you know I
[1:00:44] look back and I say Lord how do you come
[1:00:47] to Africa all the way to get me so we
[1:00:50] thank the law for the message of the
[1:00:51] alwah it's true is vindicated I've seen
[1:00:55] it myself is God is in the message God
[1:01:00] is in its world and God is in his people
[1:01:04] we have to continue in the faith because
[1:01:08] the prophet of God said watch Russia
[1:01:11] watch Russia we said coming a lot of
[1:01:15] people don't watch these things but we
[1:01:17] see it coming we see the North Korea
[1:01:20] coming very close and it become like a
[1:01:23] bait to United State of America and
[1:01:26] North Korea is like a bait is a Russian
[1:01:30] bait and as soon as you will swallow it
[1:01:34] from that day things going to happen but
[1:01:37] I believe that a bride will be gone so
[1:01:40] we have to look up and see our
[1:01:43] Redemption
[1:01:44] Asya god bless you and our licensee
[1:01:48] Josephine to come and there was a song

[1:17:54] share this with you I was I was not able
[1:17:57] to move at all
[1:17:58] I was totally it seemed like I was
[1:18:00] paralyzed I mean my back was was
[1:18:04] completely seized up and I guess I
[1:18:06] through it somehow maybe on on Thursday
[1:18:09] and Friday it just was completely out
[1:18:11] and it just got progressively worse
[1:18:13] throughout the day and then last night I
[1:18:15] I couldn't heard leave and just make it
[1:18:17] to my bed and by the time I laid down I
[1:18:20] didn't want to get up and I couldn't get
[1:18:21] up and I was kind of grunting and
[1:18:25] groaning my family was looking at me and
[1:18:26] weren't sure on what level because I
[1:18:28] guess I do have a low pain tolerance or
[1:18:30] whatever you might want to call it so
[1:18:31] you know they were Amanda was sort of
[1:18:34] gauging me a little bit I'm happy to

[1:18:45] to sing but anyway I just I was just
[1:18:49] burdened over this and it had me very
[1:18:51] very concerned and you know without
[1:18:53] exaggerating truly I was in a lot of
[1:18:55] pain and I thought tomorrow was gonna be
[1:18:57] even worse you know in your flesh the
[1:18:59] Satan wants to get you thinking that way
[1:19:00] you know and so I just texted some of
[1:19:02] the brothers some of the Deacon brothers
[1:19:04] in our church and I said pray for me I'm
[1:19:06] in a lot of pain and I can't move and
[1:19:08] they just started replying this and now
[1:19:10] but I didn't see the last text come in
[1:19:12] and about 3:00 in the morning I had to
[1:19:13] use the restroom and I got up and I
[1:19:15] couldn't hardly move I was just I was
[1:19:18] just in so much pain and finally made it
[1:19:20] there and came back and could barely lay
[1:19:22] down but I got in the bed and then I
[1:19:23] didn't want to move after that and you
[1:19:26] know how it's been if any of you had
[1:19:27] back problems I guess but I don't really
[1:19:28] have those kind of problems helps you
[1:19:30] understand how other people are feeling
[1:19:31] sometimes when you go through something
[1:19:33] like that and that could have been what
[1:19:34] that was I don't know but I woke up this
[1:19:37] morning about 6:30 and I looked over and
[1:19:39] it was my phone was right there on the
[1:19:42] on the side table and I picked it up and
[1:19:45] I looked at it and it was a text my
[1:19:47] brother he said you'll be fine in the
[1:19:48] morning
[1:19:50] and put that phone down and when I got
[1:19:53] up I hadn't tried to get up yet but it
[1:19:55] it started to hurt and I just spoke
[1:19:57] those words I said I'll be fine in the
[1:19:58] morning
[1:19:59] and I stood on my feet and by the grace
[1:20:01] of God I'm sitting here in this seat
[1:20:03] tonight I could not move last night but
[1:20:06] I was completely totally healed 100%
[1:20:08] better this morning I'm so thankful for
[1:20:10] God's healing power and healing touch

[1:47:34] Jesus Christ himself so if the words in
[1:47:37] us if the words in you in the words in
[1:47:39] me then we must treat each other like
[1:47:41] Jesus Christ amen as the body of Jesus
[1:47:44] Christ right we just certainly
[1:47:45] appreciate and the Lord for watching
[1:47:48] over you as this storm blew through and
[1:47:50] we're thinking about y'all and praying
[1:47:52] for y'all and we're from Mobile Alabama
[1:47:54] so we're have our share of storms come
[1:47:57] through there at different times but the
[1:47:59] Lord is always faithful because you know
[1:48:00] whether it's a literal storm like a
[1:48:02] hurricane or for it fits a storm in your
[1:48:04] life one thing where we have the
[1:48:07] assurance of is that Satan can do
[1:48:09] nothing except he get the nod from our
[1:48:12] Father he cannot give you a trial he
[1:48:15] cannot let the storms blow he cannot
[1:48:17] attack you without getting past your
[1:48:19] Savior amen we're so grateful an
[1:48:21] appreciate y'all again we just greet you
[1:48:23] for mobile and we just love the Lord
[1:48:26] there where's where we're studying the
[1:48:28] the message we believe the message with
[1:48:29] all our hearts and we know that it's
[1:48:31] only the message of this hour that's
[1:48:33] gonna get us out of here not the message
[1:48:36] of any other days a message of this hour
[1:48:38] because Jesus Christ is the same
[1:48:40] yesterday today and forever amen if you
[1:48:43] would we won't keep you standing for too
[1:48:45] long if you'd go with me to the book of
[1:48:47] st. John we read in two different places
[1:48:50] Saint John chapter 3 let's begin with
[1:48:54] Saint John chapter 5 524
[1:48:59] just take a few minutes here he-man st.
[1:49:05] John 5:24 reads verily verily I say unto
[1:49:09] you he that heareth my word and
[1:49:12] believeth on him that sent me hath
[1:49:14] everlasting life and shall not come into
[1:49:17] condemnation but is passed from death
[1:49:20] unto life and in st. John chapter three
[1:49:23] just one page over a cup of pages verse
[1:49:26] 3 jesus answered and said unto Him
[1:49:31] verily verily I say unto thee except a
[1:49:35] man be born again he cannot see the
[1:49:38] kingdom of God Amen let's bow our heads
[1:49:40] and our hearts they're kind of gracious
[1:49:42] Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful
[1:49:43] to you Lord for these moments that we
[1:49:45] can come and and Lord Dargis look in
[1:49:47] this family album Lord and reflect Lord
[1:49:50] and just see our reflection this word
[1:49:52] father Lord and we thank you for your
[1:49:54] truth we thank you for your word we
[1:49:55] thank you for your spirit that quick is
[1:49:57] it to our hearts we ask your blessings
[1:49:59] over each one Lord that made the
[1:50:00] sacrifice tour and the drive to come and
[1:50:03] be a part of us Lord and fellowship we
[1:50:05] thank you Lord God for all the songs
[1:50:07] that were sung Lord and all the
[1:50:09] testimonies Lord all the words of
[1:50:10] encouragement we just pray now Lord that
[1:50:12] you just settled our hearts Lord for
[1:50:14] these next few minutes so we look into
[1:50:16] your word speak to us and teach us
[1:50:18] father we ask in Jesus Christ's name
[1:50:20] Amen god bless you're seated I'd like to
[1:50:25] title this this evening he that
[1:50:28] understandeth and it's very important as
[1:50:32] I heard one of the brothers expressed
[1:50:34] you know the you know how wonderful it
[1:50:37] is that God has sent a prophet and what
[1:50:39] a difference of the different ages and
[1:50:42] how people have their own ideas of what
[1:50:43] God was and they had their own
[1:50:45] imagination and they look into the word
[1:50:47] and they just scratched their heads
[1:50:49] about what the Bible is saying but God
[1:50:51] only has one interpretation to the word
[1:50:53] and he interprets his word I bringing it
[1:50:56] to pass so God sent an i and eagle that
[1:50:59] could fly above me and see things and to
[1:51:02] hear the voice of God the Bible teaches
[1:51:05] us that God's word comes to a prophet so
[1:51:08] it's important that we listen to what
[1:51:09] God's mouthpiece says but it's not
[1:51:12] enough we've come to a day
[1:51:13] where it's not enough it's not you can't
[1:51:16] we cannot hide behind God sent a prophet
[1:51:18] anymore it must take a personal
[1:51:21] relationship where you meet God himself
[1:51:23] where you literally because it's the
[1:51:26] Prophet gives us a very important key
[1:51:28] here the key that the Prophet gives us
[1:51:31] is that the word CE means to understand
[1:51:34] and it's important that as we go and as
[1:51:37] we express these things for a few
[1:51:39] minutes this evening as we look into
[1:51:40] these things to not get overwhelmed or
[1:51:43] to misunderstand the thought tonight
[1:51:45] it's not about intellectual conception
[1:51:48] it's not about learning upon learning
[1:51:50] because the Bible tells us that there's
[1:51:52] people that are always learning but
[1:51:55] never able to come to the truth because
[1:51:58] remember Jesus said I am the way the
[1:52:00] truth and the life
[1:52:01] so it's a very the word that we have is
[1:52:04] very dangerous to try and learn it an
[1:52:08] intellectual conception and then remain
[1:52:11] in the church non born-again that is a
[1:52:14] dangerous place to be in and we've come
[1:52:16] to an hour we've come to a point where
[1:52:18] it gets a razor's edge brother Dale amen
[1:52:21] it comes to a point where we've got to
[1:52:23] meet him because if you meet him then
[1:52:27] you can understand properly and then you
[1:52:30] can't understand the word we believe the
[1:52:34] word but belief has got to give way to
[1:52:38] understanding it must give way to
[1:52:42] understanding Jesus himself said verily
[1:52:45] verily I say unto you except a man be
[1:52:48] born again you've got to be born again
[1:52:50] before you can understand properly and
[1:52:54] there's multitudes of people that
[1:52:56] confess the truth that are not born
[1:52:58] again there's multitudes of people that
[1:53:01] confess that Jesus Christ rose from the
[1:53:03] dead but they themselves have never
[1:53:05] experienced it because the Bible says
[1:53:06] that no man can say that jesus is the
[1:53:09] christ but by the Holy Ghost
[1:53:11] no one here see the napkin that was on
[1:53:15] his head no one here seen the stone that
[1:53:17] was raised but every person with the
[1:53:19] Holy Ghost can testify that he rose from
[1:53:21] the dead
[1:53:22] because had he not risen from the dead
[1:53:24] you wouldn't have the Holy Ghost so if
[1:53:27] you have God's given you the born-again
[1:53:29] experience then you know he rose from
[1:53:31] the dead it's proof of his resurrection
[1:53:35] this message is proof of his
[1:53:38] resurrection it's proof that the church
[1:53:40] agent that the Dark Ages could not keep
[1:53:43] the truth bound anymore but there's been
[1:53:45] a rising of the Sun there's been a
[1:53:47] resurrection there was that Roman seal
[1:53:49] on there that kept that kept the truth
[1:53:51] hidden from man when they could even
[1:53:54] have their own Bible but there's been a
[1:53:56] resurrection and it's not enough to just
[1:53:59] believe there's been a resurrection of
[1:54:00] the ages got to be a resurrection in
[1:54:02] your own life and then lining up to this
[1:54:06] word will be like everyday living to you
[1:54:08] but as long as as we try and do
[1:54:11] something in our own strength
[1:54:13] we'll always mess up somewhere we'll
[1:54:15] always brother and call it find yourself
[1:54:17] wrecked up somewhere but you get to him
[1:54:20] first
[1:54:22] don't try and learn or understand the
[1:54:25] message without the Holy Ghost it's not
[1:54:28] possible
[1:54:29] that's why there's so many false
[1:54:31] doctrines get the Holy Ghost first meet
[1:54:35] him first get on them they're sacred
[1:54:38] that they're sacred grounds that the
[1:54:40] Prophet talked about meet the pillar of
[1:54:42] fire for yourself and then God the
[1:54:46] inside teacher will come to you right
[1:54:48] and then he'll do just like he said
[1:54:50] he'll lead you and guide you in all
[1:54:51] truth people get wrecked up because they
[1:54:57] handle the word without the Holy Ghost
[1:54:59] whether it's behind the pulpit whether
[1:55:02] it's their own life whether it's in
[1:55:05] their own home they'll find themselves
[1:55:08] with a cow on top of the tree and grass
[1:55:14] because when we went out when a believer
[1:55:16] becomes born again their baby in the
[1:55:19] Lord they're a baby they have that
[1:55:22] potential the same Holy Ghost that's in
[1:55:24] a born-again Christian that was just
[1:55:26] born again let's say five minutes ago is
[1:55:29] the same spirit that was in Christ it's
[1:55:31] the same spirit that was in the Prophet
[1:55:33] that's in that's in those that have been
[1:55:34] there have been a Christian for decades
[1:55:36] it's the same spirit but if that the
[1:55:39] potential is in you like a seed the
[1:55:41] raptures in you everything you have need
[1:55:44] up in this life's journey is in you at
[1:55:46] the baptism of the Holy Ghost but you've
[1:55:50] got to water it you've got to feed on
[1:55:53] the word you've got to grow into that
[1:55:55] statue of a perfect man but it's the
[1:55:58] Holy Ghost doing it if it's not the Holy
[1:56:02] Ghost doing it then how are we any
[1:56:03] different than than just denominations
[1:56:06] how are we any different than good works
[1:56:07] God didn't send the Holy Ghost to make
[1:56:09] you a better neighbor God didn't send
[1:56:11] the Holy Ghost to the Jew just so you
[1:56:12] don't drink it's just so you don't smoke
[1:56:14] he said the Holy Ghost for a
[1:56:16] resurrection so every born-again
[1:56:22] believer believes all the Word of God
[1:56:25] but you can't camp there there's God
[1:56:29] just like every born-again Christian
[1:56:30] should be able to look back and say I'm
[1:56:32] not what I should be today but I'm not
[1:56:34] what I was I know more of him I love him
[1:56:39] more because with understanding comes
[1:56:41] love you know when you have little ones
[1:56:45] and you try and explain things to them
[1:56:46] they can but they're they have to
[1:56:48] believe you because they don't
[1:56:51] understand why you tell them don't hang
[1:56:53] out with this type of people don't do
[1:56:55] this just trust me you'll know when you
[1:56:57] get older but trust me and they take
[1:56:59] your word for it because they love you
[1:57:01] and they believe you as your parent but
[1:57:03] there comes an age where they become
[1:57:05] mature and they start to think for
[1:57:07] themselves and say that's why mom and
[1:57:08] dad told me this now I'll understand
[1:57:11] that makes me love them even more before
[1:57:14] it may just seem like rules but
[1:57:18] afterwards you begin that love comes
[1:57:21] that love comes that with that perfect
[1:57:24] faith with that perfect understanding
[1:57:26] that comes a love you mean that God
[1:57:28] loved me so much he would actually let
[1:57:30] me see this in his word he would speak
[1:57:32] to me this is a family album
[1:57:36] if you look if your mom and dad said son
[1:57:39] daughter here's our family album looking
[1:57:42] to it and you looked into it and you
[1:57:44] seen mom and you seen dad and you seen
[1:57:48] Grandpa Joe when you seen aunt Susie but
[1:57:51] what if you didn't see herself in there
[1:57:53] you'd begin to think am i part of this
[1:57:56] family why is it that everybody's in
[1:57:59] there but I don't see me where's the
[1:58:00] picture of me so when we look in this
[1:58:05] word it's not enough to just see Jesus
[1:58:07] it's not enough to just see brother
[1:58:09] branham you see them but do you see
[1:58:13] yourself in the message do you see
[1:58:15] herself in the word then it becomes
[1:58:17] personal and only the Holy Ghost can
[1:58:20] show your your own picture where you can
[1:58:22] look you remember that little boy that
[1:58:23] was in the mirror when he was a country
[1:58:25] boy and he went to the city and he's
[1:58:26] seen a mirror and what he did that's
[1:58:28] what the reflection was and the little
[1:58:31] boy got a reflection and said mommy
[1:58:32] that's me and when we look into the word
[1:58:35] and we see and we see a Rahab or we see
[1:58:39] the widow woman that they entertained
[1:58:41] Elijah and all these things we should be
[1:58:43] able to look to our father and say Lord
[1:58:44] that's me that's me it takes the Holy
[1:58:48] Ghost to do that it's not enough to just
[1:58:52] say I believe the message I believe the
[1:58:54] word whatever it says I don't know what
[1:58:57] it says I don't understand what it says
[1:58:59] but I believe it that's fine to a
[1:59:01] certain point please don't misunderstand
[1:59:02] me that's great
[1:59:04] that's what believers should be told
[1:59:05] when they're born when they're starting
[1:59:07] out but there should be some growth
[1:59:09] somewhere you should be a better
[1:59:11] Christian today than what you are five
[1:59:12] years ago you should have more
[1:59:14] understanding you shouldn't know more
[1:59:15] about your father there's got to be some
[1:59:19] understanding and belief is there and
[1:59:23] the more you understand the more you
[1:59:25] believe Lord I don't know that part yet
[1:59:27] but I believe it and in your grace and
[1:59:29] in your time you're gonna leave me there
[1:59:31] because I have the insight teacher and
[1:59:33] thence I teach it will lead me and guide
[1:59:35] me in all truth so let's not
[1:59:41] misunderstand revelation for just
[1:59:43] knowledge because Eve lusted for
[1:59:46] knowledge if she would have waited for
[1:59:50] God
[1:59:50] timon God would have given the
[1:59:51] revelation to Adam and Adam could have
[1:59:53] preached it to Eve but Eve try to bypass
[1:59:56] Adam enlisted foreknowledge apart from
[2:00:00] revelation there's a big difference
[2:00:01] between knowledge and in Revelation
[2:00:06] brother Branham says I'm afraid today
[2:00:10] too many of us are not getting people to
[2:00:12] Christ think of that
[2:00:15] he said we're getting them to a church
[2:00:19] to a theory but we must get into Christ
[2:00:24] he is the only one in the only one that
[2:00:27] has life he has he that has the son has
[2:00:31] life and I believe in this our God / we
[2:00:35] need to pray that God help us to keep us
[2:00:37] from indoctrination we need revelation
[2:00:42] there's a difference especially in this
[2:00:46] our saints whenever people can get
[2:00:48] indoctrinated and sit on the Pew and
[2:00:50] being indoctrinated and message believer
[2:00:52] and not have life and not have the
[2:00:55] resurrection power not be able to
[2:00:56] overcome but they know that God sent a
[2:01:01] prophet they can tell you the seven
[2:01:03] churches they can tell you all these
[2:01:05] different facts the message is more than
[2:01:07] stories there there's revelation behind
[2:01:09] them stories
[2:01:10] there's revelation behind them sentences
[2:01:12] there there there's life in there
[2:01:15] because the letter killeth but the
[2:01:18] Spirit gives life remember to bring a
[2:01:22] birth you need a seed in seed is not
[2:01:26] just a jar by itself it's not just the
[2:01:29] egg by itself this seed is a seed when
[2:01:31] it comes together so a person cannot be
[2:01:34] born again by just a letter you can't
[2:01:37] get born again by just a letter you need
[2:01:39] the Spirit to quicken the letter to you
[2:01:40] and then it becomes life when the Spirit
[2:01:44] gets in that letter and it quickly then
[2:01:47] it quickens you to eternal life and
[2:01:50] that's the only thing can bring life
[2:01:52] they've had the letter for 2,000 years
[2:01:54] and God sent the spirit and quickened
[2:01:57] the elect of every age behind that
[2:01:59] letter and it became real to them it
[2:02:02] became flesh and blood to them
[2:02:04] the word has got to become flesh it's
[2:02:07] got to this letter of the Bible is not
[2:02:10] gonna go up in the rapture and be
[2:02:12] translated but the Bible in you if it's
[2:02:17] in you that will be translated that will
[2:02:19] quicken you if the spirit that raised
[2:02:21] Christ from the dead dwell in you he
[2:02:24] goes on in the sermon beyond the camp
[2:02:28] brother Joe I'm sorry I got I got this
[2:02:31] after I gave you all the quotes but he
[2:02:33] says as I look and preach across the
[2:02:35] nation and watch the people I am fully
[2:02:37] persuaded that people are not getting to
[2:02:39] Christ prophet of God talking he said
[2:02:44] and I believe that it's the enemy that's
[2:02:46] throw this hindrance because the reason
[2:02:48] I believe is or he said I believe this
[2:02:51] he is not the object that they have been
[2:02:53] pointed to they have either been pointed
[2:02:56] to a dogma a doctrine or a party or
[2:03:00] experience or a sensation or something
[2:03:02] like that instead of being pointed to
[2:03:04] Christ alert as long as they may believe
[2:03:08] certain certain doctrines in there then
[2:03:10] they're just bless God you're a believer
[2:03:12] you're going in the rapture because you
[2:03:14] believe God sent a prophet no no no the
[2:03:19] bride believes God sent a prophet but
[2:03:21] the bride believes more than Jay what
[2:03:24] the Prophet said is flesh in you that's
[2:03:27] who's going in the rapture right he's
[2:03:30] got to be real he goes on he said that's
[2:03:35] why I think that people are resting
[2:03:37] their eternal destination upon some
[2:03:39] dogma or some sensation like some say I
[2:03:42] danced in the spirit I spoke with
[2:03:43] tongues I felt fire running over me and
[2:03:45] do you know all of those those things
[2:03:47] can be impersonated by the devil he says
[2:03:50] there's just one thing that he cannot
[2:03:53] impersonate - that's the word in a
[2:03:56] debate between he and Jesus each time
[2:03:59] Jesus defeated him it is written the
[2:04:03] word it's got to be the word
[2:04:08] it's got to be not like I said not
[2:04:11] learning upon learning this isn't
[2:04:13] intellectual discourse this is life it's
[2:04:17] got to be the the spirit has got to
[2:04:19] quick on that word in st. John 8:24
[2:04:23] let's turn there real fast if you will
[2:04:25] eight st. John 8:24 I said therefore
[2:04:32] unto you that ye shall die in your sins
[2:04:36] for if he believed not that I am he ye
[2:04:40] shall die in your sins think present
[2:04:43] Tansen let's drop down to verse 31 then
[2:04:46] said Jesus to those Jews which believed
[2:04:49] on him if he continue in my word then
[2:04:52] are you my disciples indeed and ye shall
[2:04:55] know the truth and the truth shall make
[2:04:58] you free
[2:04:59] it takes more to be a disciple than just
[2:05:01] to believe that God sent a prophet or
[2:05:04] that Jesus came in flesh the true
[2:05:06] disciples were in the upper room the
[2:05:09] true disciples follow Jesus every step
[2:05:11] of the way every step of the way and
[2:05:12] found themselves in the upper room God
[2:05:16] did not sin unseal all these mysteries
[2:05:19] he had for 6,000 years unseal them just
[2:05:22] for head knowledge just to know
[2:05:26] something there's a purpose behind it
[2:05:29] because we have to do something that has
[2:05:31] never been done by a group of people
[2:05:34] Mary had to be had to believe something
[2:05:37] in brother Graham said it's never been
[2:05:38] done before she had to conceive in her
[2:05:40] womb as a virgin and God provided the
[2:05:44] word and the spirit he provided the seed
[2:05:46] both together so the bride the word is
[2:05:50] in the bride as it was in Mary she's got
[2:05:52] to do something that has only been being
[2:05:55] and type and shadow by individuals
[2:05:58] Elijah Titus he was translated but now
[2:06:01] as a group that we've got to be changed
[2:06:03] and then translated as a bride
[2:06:07] something's never been done before but
[2:06:09] the but we believe it as Mary did you
[2:06:14] know
[2:06:14] something like this would literally take
[2:06:17] months and months to preach
[2:06:19] so if the spirit reveals thinks to you
[2:06:22] that I might not be referring to just
[2:06:24] holding down y'all write them down go
[2:06:25] back and reread them and study them
[2:06:28] because this is just high points we just
[2:06:29] you know we're just trying to hit some
[2:06:30] high points so much can be said about
[2:06:33] this whenever Jesus refers to the
[2:06:36] parable the sower when he starts to
[2:06:38] break it down of what the meaning of
[2:06:40] that is whenever those that fell by the
[2:06:42] wayside Jesus broke that down and said
[2:06:45] those are they that hear the word but
[2:06:48] they don't understand it and before they
[2:06:50] can get understanding the enemies then
[2:06:52] birds go in that evil spirits going to
[2:06:54] may take that seed away because there's
[2:06:57] no understanding the understanding is
[2:07:00] not fruitful the Holy Ghost must quicken
[2:07:07] the word only and make it power and
[2:07:11] demonstration in our lives because
[2:07:14] remember Paul say the word came not
[2:07:16] aboard only but a power and
[2:07:17] demonstration you say well well well the
[2:07:21] the you know the dead aren't raised and
[2:07:22] the sick may not be miracle miraculously
[2:07:24] healed in every service that's not just
[2:07:26] that's not the only kind of power the
[2:07:29] kind of power is that while Peter yet
[2:07:31] spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on
[2:07:33] them that heard it that was power behind
[2:07:34] the words what if on the day of
[2:07:37] Pentecost whenever they were there
[2:07:38] staggering around like drunk me and they
[2:07:39] said you know what is this what if Peter
[2:07:42] would have said the Lord thy God is
[2:07:44] gonna build an ark and he's gonna float
[2:07:46] it down the LORD thy God is gonna drop a
[2:07:48] plague of fleas and he's gonna he's
[2:07:50] gonna destroy this place by fleas the
[2:07:52] Holy Ghost and I have quickened them but
[2:07:54] when he said this is that and he
[2:07:56] properly identified the word for the day
[2:07:58] then I only goes quick and those that
[2:08:01] heard the word a person can get the Holy
[2:08:05] Ghost you if your trust in the Lord for
[2:08:07] the Holy Ghost can get the Holy Ghost
[2:08:08] right or brother Dale one of these
[2:08:09] brothers are or any any minister while
[2:08:12] you listening to a tape while they heard
[2:08:14] of the word that power and demonstration
[2:08:17] can come and say that's for me that's
[2:08:19] how you can get healed that's how you
[2:08:20] can get delivered is when that spirit
[2:08:22] charges that word charges that letter
[2:08:26] and then it becomes life that's the work
[2:08:29] of the Spirit that's power and
[2:08:31] demonstration
[2:08:33] that's whenever when seeing the power
[2:08:35] sing gets broken off your life when the
[2:08:37] influence of the world gets broken off
[2:08:39] your life when that word it means
[2:08:41] something when that word whenever you
[2:08:43] hear your name calls
[2:08:45] that's the difference when it's your
[2:08:49] name then you don't care what your
[2:08:50] friends think you don't care what your
[2:08:52] mom and dad may think you hear your
[2:08:54] voice you hear his voice call your name
[2:08:57] rather in first Corinthians 8 want Paul
[2:09:03] says now as touching things offered into
[2:09:05] idols we know that we have not all had
[2:09:08] knowledge knowledge puffeth up but
[2:09:11] charity love edifies now he didn't say
[2:09:14] revelation puffs without knowledge
[2:09:17] puffeth up because remember that grain
[2:09:20] of wheat the heavier that head gets the
[2:09:24] more boughs right as that wheat matures
[2:09:26] the green ones
[2:09:27] they stick straight up but as they
[2:09:31] mature in that grain that heavy grain
[2:09:33] brother Dale gets heavy full maturity in
[2:09:35] the presence of the son it against the
[2:09:37] bow humility there's nothing to be
[2:09:41] there's nothing to boast about our
[2:09:42] boasting is in him and him alone so true
[2:09:48] revelation brings the realization of
[2:09:50] love because paul also said though i
[2:09:54] have the gift of prophecy and understand
[2:09:56] all mysteries because remember the
[2:09:59] prophet taught us that Judas partook of
[2:10:00] the mysteries there was a certain level
[2:10:03] we could get to we've got so much truth
[2:10:05] and it's so plain in this hour people
[2:10:07] can come right up to the truth and they
[2:10:09] can see serpent seed they may be able to
[2:10:12] see Malachi 4:5 they can see it it's
[2:10:15] there in the Bible it's plain they can
[2:10:19] partake of some mysteries
[2:10:22] and still not be with it
[2:10:25] that is why I'm preaching to you this
[2:10:29] evening that you've got to meet him
[2:10:30] first meet him first
[2:10:33] don't you know and I think it's
[2:10:35] especially good for for people that are
[2:10:36] raised in the message and clear you know
[2:10:38] that's how I was raising the message and
[2:10:40] you raised up you know listen the
[2:10:42] Prophet it becomes a second nature you
[2:10:44] hear it in your home and and you hear
[2:10:45] you go to church every Sunday you you
[2:10:47] never smoked you never drank you never
[2:10:49] done them things but you're still a
[2:10:51] sinner you hear them things and becomes
[2:10:53] a second nature
[2:10:56] so you can find yourself if you're not
[2:11:00] careful you can find yourself being in a
[2:11:01] message church for years and years
[2:11:03] without the born-again experience
[2:11:06] because you can hear statements that say
[2:11:11] you know in brother Graham himself said
[2:11:13] hearing the word for your day that's the
[2:11:16] evidence of the Holy Ghost but there's
[2:11:18] so much more to qualify that there's so
[2:11:20] much more that you can't isolate that
[2:11:22] statement because remember the Bible
[2:11:24] says that the devil's believe in tremble
[2:11:28] remember in the Bible whenever whenever
[2:11:30] whenever them their mom the men over
[2:11:33] there in the book of Acts try to cast
[2:11:34] out Devils by Jesus whom Paul preaches
[2:11:36] they knew who Paul was and then then
[2:11:40] people that try to cast him out knew
[2:11:41] that Paul was a man of God but they
[2:11:44] didn't have that that power so
[2:11:49] revelation you should read the church
[2:11:52] age book what brother Graham said about
[2:11:53] revelation because when you desire
[2:11:56] revelation which every Christian should
[2:11:58] and does it's not the same like your
[2:12:02] it's not a lust for knowledge it's God's
[2:12:05] love letter to you every Christian if
[2:12:09] the raptures a revelation the born-again
[2:12:11] experience is a revelation your healing
[2:12:13] is a revelation everything is based on
[2:12:15] that revelation and that's what we must
[2:12:18] cry for the revelation the hunger for
[2:12:20] revelation is a deep crying to the deep
[2:12:22] and that deep is gonna respond so let's
[2:12:27] quickly move on think about whenever
[2:12:32] that when Peter said that day went on
[2:12:34] the day of Pentecost
[2:12:35] he said you know this is that which was
[2:12:38] spoken by the Prophet Joel you had the
[2:12:41] same you had people in the temple
[2:12:43] reading the letter of the word while
[2:12:47] Rome was surrounding them they were
[2:12:50] killed because they had the letter of
[2:12:53] the word but missed the manifestation of
[2:12:56] that brother branham did not come and
[2:13:01] preached from 47 to 65 just to take up
[2:13:04] just to fill our heads with facts he
[2:13:08] came to introduce him and have he not
[2:13:11] come and introduced him we could go
[2:13:13] nowhere we would just live our lives and
[2:13:17] just die like everyone else but it's
[2:13:20] connected the word and the translation
[2:13:22] is connected brother Ram says it takes a
[2:13:26] union to make a seed is that right
[2:13:28] doctor has to be you got a whole lot of
[2:13:30] pulp out here don't one didn't have no
[2:13:32] life and implanted it had never come up
[2:13:34] lay it there and rot lay there and right
[2:13:36] and you couldn't plant the life without
[2:13:38] having the pulp so you see the whole
[2:13:40] thing is a union I'm trying to tell you
[2:13:45] now about Christ and the church it's a
[2:13:48] union both collectively and individually
[2:13:52] you've got to be personally have a union
[2:13:55] I brother Lewis was saying you've got to
[2:13:57] have them in your house and the reason
[2:14:01] that he's in this building is because
[2:14:02] you're supposed to have brought him
[2:14:04] that's why when it when the church went
[2:14:06] one that when the licks of a fire gone
[2:14:08] it's just a shell so he goes on he says
[2:14:14] so you see the whole thing's a union I'm
[2:14:15] trying to now about Christ in the church
[2:14:17] there's a union see if the woman is the
[2:14:19] seed of herself then she doesn't need a
[2:14:20] male she can have the baby by herself
[2:14:23] have her baby herself but she can't be
[2:14:25] she can't have the baby until she's been
[2:14:27] with the male because it takes the two
[2:14:30] together to make a seed is that right
[2:14:31] it's not enough to just have the letter
[2:14:34] of the word brothers and sisters you got
[2:14:36] to have the word in the spirit if you
[2:14:37] want a birth if you want a new birth
[2:14:39] just like you couldn't come here the
[2:14:42] first time without both neither can you
[2:14:44] come here neither can you go up there
[2:14:46] and be born again without both the word
[2:14:48] and the
[2:14:49] the Pentecostals may have the spirit the
[2:14:53] anointing but they don't have a word
[2:14:55] they don't have it into Wales people can
[2:14:57] have them the word but I have the spirit
[2:15:00] to quicken to it and there's no life
[2:15:02] let's quickly go on to the next one and
[2:15:07] the Easter still he says it's the Holy
[2:15:08] Spirit coming down too quick and make
[2:15:11] alive those people that's for ordained
[2:15:13] of God to be in the rapture notice that
[2:15:17] is if he is a true eagle he will
[2:15:21] understand the message of the hour if
[2:15:24] he's a true eagle now the little Eagle
[2:15:27] problem the barnyard was eating all
[2:15:29] right but he knowed he wasn't it wasn't
[2:15:31] just exactly right but then when he
[2:15:33] heard the truth then he received this
[2:15:35] truth John 5:24 rather Jesus said
[2:15:39] speaking this way he that heareth my
[2:15:41] word and believeth on him that sent me
[2:15:42] hath everlasting life and shall not come
[2:15:44] into the judgment but has passed from
[2:15:46] death unto life just think of how simple
[2:15:48] that is he that believeth now the
[2:15:50] correct way of saying that he that
[2:15:53] understandeth now you go out here on the
[2:15:57] street and say to this prostitute you
[2:15:59] believe sure you believe he's the son of
[2:16:01] God certainly been baptized sure go down
[2:16:03] to the drunker do you hear that hear the
[2:16:04] preacher preach yeah you believe that
[2:16:06] sure see but he that understandeth he
[2:16:11] that knoweth his place in this hour he
[2:16:14] that heareth my word and believeth on
[2:16:16] him that sent me
[2:16:17] present-tense eternal life shall not
[2:16:21] come into the judgment but it has
[2:16:22] already passed from death unto life so
[2:16:25] you can even put in there you believe
[2:16:27] you know you can go out on the street
[2:16:28] people knew brother Aaron personally you
[2:16:30] believe brother ends profit yeah sure
[2:16:31] you believe that woman that was in the
[2:16:33] wheelchair that she that you know no
[2:16:35] older man that you you seen that one
[2:16:37] raised it from the from the wheelchair
[2:16:38] sure do you believe us God sure but they
[2:16:41] not understand
[2:16:42] they not have a revelation of why God
[2:16:46] sent a prophet let's go to 2nd Peter
[2:16:51] about to bring it here to a landing like
[2:16:54] I said Saints just trying to hit some
[2:16:55] high points and encourage you to just
[2:16:57] seek out and and study and and just
[2:17:00] trust the Lord cuz he'll lead you and
[2:17:02] guide you if you don't have the Holy
[2:17:03] Ghost yet get the Holy Ghost first get
[2:17:06] born again because it's a promise don't
[2:17:10] attempt to try and understand and get
[2:17:12] revelation apart from the Holy Ghost in
[2:17:16] 2nd Peter 1:20 knowing this first that
[2:17:21] no prophecy of the scripture is of any
[2:17:24] private interpretation brother Aaron
[2:17:27] quoted that Scripture a lot and when I
[2:17:29] hear that script you know I think well
[2:17:31] praise God that's true God it's not just
[2:17:34] one you know God's Word comes to the
[2:17:35] Prophet but then those that have an ear
[2:17:37] to hear will hear but I want us to
[2:17:39] notice and that's very true but I want
[2:17:40] us to notice what Scofield put here if
[2:17:42] you have a Scofield if you look at the
[2:17:44] margin reading it has a little H and it
[2:17:47] says its own interpretation for example
[2:17:49] not isolated from all that the word has
[2:17:53] given elsewhere that puts a whole new
[2:17:56] meaning on what the private
[2:17:57] interpretation is you cannot isolate it
[2:18:00] one single scripture it's got to run
[2:18:02] from Genesis to Revelation and back and
[2:18:04] forth you can't isolate one quote of the
[2:18:07] Prophet it's got to go from 47 to 65
[2:18:10] back through Genesis all the way back to
[2:18:12] Revelation when we listen to the Prophet
[2:18:15] we should have our Bibles open it's like
[2:18:17] when God told Moses about weaving the
[2:18:20] curtain the veil it's in and out all
[2:18:23] them colors in and out that's how this
[2:18:25] words got to be that's how the
[2:18:26] revelations got to be in our hearts then
[2:18:28] we know where we stand and don't get
[2:18:31] don't don't get overwhelmed and say
[2:18:34] praise God I was born again last year
[2:18:36] and there's just so much it's not about
[2:18:38] learning you know you're born again
[2:18:41] today and he comes tomorrow you're going
[2:18:43] to the rapture he'll lead you and guide
[2:18:46] you in all truth
[2:18:48] he'll take care of that that's why I'm
[2:18:50] saying get born again first and then
[2:18:52] he'll take care of the rest and all the
[2:18:55] things you may not understand you
[2:18:56] believe it you believe it
[2:18:58] think of Shamgar and closing Shamgar
[2:19:02] believed Shamgar was an israelite he
[2:19:06] believed he was in the promised land he
[2:19:08] believed that God sent Moses God sent a
[2:19:11] prophet that God sent Joshua and placed
[2:19:13] him there and it was his inheritance be
[2:19:16] it the Philistines would still come
[2:19:18] every year and take his hard-earned work
[2:19:21] all of his food would take it from his
[2:19:23] family
[2:19:24] but one day Shamgar got a revelation so
[2:19:30] compared to when Shamgar only believed
[2:19:32] and he was right in his belief but when
[2:19:36] he got a revelation then he said wait a
[2:19:37] minute
[2:19:38] I'm Abraham see this is my inheritance
[2:19:42] then he got that off stocks gold and
[2:19:45] killed a thousand Philistines by himself
[2:19:47] that's the difference between revelation
[2:19:49] and just under intellectual just
[2:19:52] believing Satan can be bossing you
[2:19:56] around and pushing you around on your
[2:19:57] emotions and coming and taking your joy
[2:20:00] like to fill us things all the time but
[2:20:02] then one day you get a revelation and
[2:20:04] then you slay them evil spirits you slay
[2:20:08] that influence in your life you slay the
[2:20:11] influence and that's trying to wreck
[2:20:13] your family ask God for revelation
[2:20:17] because nothing is of such prevailing
[2:20:20] power eyes revelation on the word in
[2:20:24] Revelation is 229 he that hath an ear
[2:20:27] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[2:20:30] the churches every person that God
[2:20:33] creates if they're born normally has an
[2:20:36] ear has to but just a very few can hear
[2:20:41] what he says by his Spirit to the
[2:20:44] churches so whenever we read and and we
[2:20:48] and we hear and we and we see that we
[2:20:50] remember see think about many times
[2:20:52] brother would preach II go see see see
[2:20:54] means to understand one less quote in
[2:21:00] perfect faith talking about Jesus he had
[2:21:06] faith with his power how did he he said
[2:21:11] I can do nothing in myself why he relied
[2:21:14] upon what he was he relied and knowing
[2:21:18] that he was the word he had faith in God
[2:21:22] who made him the word he was the word he
[2:21:24] was God the word and they was in him and
[2:21:26] that give him faith because he
[2:21:28] understood his position he knows what he
[2:21:31] was because the scripture had said he
[2:21:33] was this and here every scripture taught
[2:21:35] him to prove that he was exactly what
[2:21:36] the scripture said he would be and he
[2:21:39] knew what he was therefore he relied
[2:21:41] upon what God had made him and if he did
[2:21:43] that they can't we rely upon what God
[2:21:46] made us as believers Jesus himself had
[2:21:52] to understand the scripture he was the
[2:21:54] word and by God's help we'll get into
[2:21:57] tomorrow but Jesus had to look into the
[2:21:59] word and find what was written about him
[2:22:00] and when he found that nothing could
[2:22:04] stand in his way in the bride I believe
[2:22:07] by God's grace the elect the bride is
[2:22:11] beginning to and has but God is
[2:22:14] beginning to show her her place in the
[2:22:17] scripture and then she can sit there and
[2:22:19] when she realizes that and by revelation
[2:22:21] how many of us have heard the tape same
[2:22:23] tape over and over and over how many of
[2:22:26] us have heard one of one of the minister
[2:22:28] brothers preach the same thing but one
[2:22:29] day it strikes is different God's given
[2:22:33] you a revelation reach out and grab it
[2:22:35] because it belongs to you don't be like
[2:22:38] that servant that had that gold that
[2:22:40] deity and buried his talent under the
[2:22:42] earth invest it take what God is giving
[2:22:47] and share it with others invest that
[2:22:49] revelation invest that deity live for
[2:22:51] others and that's eternal life they may
[2:22:54] accomplish your Saints pray that the
[2:22:57] Lord has spoken to your hearts in some
[2:22:59] way this evening and just just there's
[2:23:01] so much more that could have been said
[2:23:02] there's so much more that brother round
[2:23:03] taught on studying and on understanding
[2:23:06] and like I said Saints please don't let
[2:23:09] it overwhelm you don't misunderstand
[2:23:10] that has got to be some Oh
[2:23:13] goodness I've got two there's people
[2:23:15] that could have PhDs in this message and
[2:23:19] just be as void of the Spirit of God as
[2:23:21] ever and there can be people that are
[2:23:24] that are chock full of the Spirit
[2:23:25] freshly born again and gotten and they
[2:23:28] may not know very much but do you know
[2:23:30] what one can be led one can be taught
[2:23:32] true revelation the other ones just head
[2:23:34] knowledge head knowledge is in the
[2:23:37] tribulation period revelation is bound
[2:23:41] for the rapture
[2:23:42] hey man god bless y'all tonight there's
[2:23:44] just bow our heads and I'll turn the
[2:23:46] server's back to brother Dale do you
