[9:06] we read your word you come and speak to
[9:08] our hearts in Jesus name
[9:10] amen
[9:13] Romans 8.
[9:15] Lord willing Maybe
[9:18] in another week we'll get back on to
[9:21] really covering a lot about
[9:23] predestination the seed etc etc as we go
[9:27] along but I felt it needful to bring
[9:29] these things in to see why that we need
[9:32] to be this and what happened to us and
[9:34] you know what's taking place and all
[9:37] like that
[9:40] Romans 8 28 and we know that all things
[9:43] work together for good to them that love
[9:45] God to them who are thee called
[9:47] according to his purpose for whom he did
[9:49] for no he also did predestinate to be
[9:52] conformed to the image of his son that
[9:55] he might be the firstborn among many
[9:56] brethren
[9:58] moreover whom he did predestinate then
[10:01] he also called and whom he called them
[10:03] he also justified in whom he justified
[10:06] them he also glorified
[10:08] what shall we then say to these things
[10:11] if God be for us who can be against us
[10:14] amen now let's go to John 10
[10:19] we'll begin reading in verse 1.
[10:24] verily verily I say unto you
[10:27] he that entereth not by the door into
[10:29] the Sheepfold but climates up some other
[10:31] way the same as the thief and a robber
[10:34] but he does interest in by the door is
[10:37] The Shepherd of the Sheep
[10:40] to him the porter openeth
[10:42] and the sheep hear his voice
[10:45] now watch the hymn is God the Porter is
[10:49] a vessel used so that's the end time of
[10:52] the prophet's message the porter but
[10:54] remember whose voice is heard sure it's
[10:57] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[10:58] angel but remember the voice of God
[11:01] we're talking about
[11:02] to him the Porter openeth and the sheep
[11:05] hear his voice and he calls his own
[11:07] Sheep by name and leadeth them out
[11:10] and when he put forth his own sheep he
[11:12] goes before them and does she follow him
[11:15] before they know his voice and a
[11:17] stranger will they not follow
[11:20] but will flee from him for they know not
[11:23] the voice of strangers you may be seated
[11:26] the Lord had his Blessing to the reading
[11:28] of the word
[11:37] now we've been
[11:39] they're just past Wednesday
[11:43] we were speaking about
[11:46] oh
[11:48] I'm taking Revelations 5.
[11:51] I'm talking about
[11:53] the book that was in the hand of the one
[11:54] sitting on the throne
[11:57] and we found that to be
[12:00] the word of God right
[12:02] which is the Bible
[12:04] all right now it's not a Scofield
[12:07] Thompson Chain
[12:09] Etc you know
[12:10] oh it's not this aversion that version
[12:15] it's just a list of names
[12:18] the book in the hand of the one sitting
[12:19] on the throne is a list of names the
[12:22] prophet said 267 sardinesian Church age
[12:25] we gave our Sunday
[12:27] only names is written in that book
[12:29] all right now then when we look at that
[12:34] book we found out that
[12:37] being the Bible
[12:40] that
[12:42] it would turn out to be as the prophet
[12:44] called it in the church age book
[12:47] when he would speak of it and he was
[12:49] concerned about it
[12:50] because he had spoken in the church age
[12:53] book about uh if you'll go over about
[12:56] 266 67 68 and read backwards and forth
[13:01] there in the church age book you'll hear
[13:03] him explaining all of the things about
[13:07] uh you know the the difference
[13:10] parts of the sections as he calls it
[13:14] he called it three times in the church
[13:15] age sardisan church he called it
[13:18] sections
[13:19] of that book all right then we saw that
[13:23] it's not two books because that's what
[13:25] he was concerned about
[13:27] he was worried that people had
[13:30] misunderstood him and brother Lee Vale
[13:33] had brought it he said to his attention
[13:35] and it looks like two books
[13:39] but it wound up being one book
[13:43] the
[13:45] the lounge Book of Life
[13:47] The Book of Life
[13:49] the book of the living
[13:51] all is the same book
[13:53] but it's one book
[13:55] with many sections in it so as we were
[13:58] trying to cover now Wednesday just to
[14:00] pull the background up to where we're at
[14:03] see then the lounge Book of Life
[14:06] is the Eternal section of God's word
[14:10] this Bible here if you took out
[14:13] all of the things written of time you
[14:16] know and what's going on what would you
[14:19] have
[14:21] you would have a book of names
[14:23] right
[14:25] you would have a Moses a David or Disney
[14:28] you know who you would have a Peter of
[14:30] Paul and James and then you'd have
[14:33] the part that we'll get to in a little
[14:35] while the
[14:36] the part of writing our names are
[14:39] but you would have
[14:41] a list of names
[14:43] all right the Bible then takes that name
[14:46] and God did it so beautiful that he took
[14:49] the names
[14:51] and when he did he wrote a record of
[14:54] what goes around there that was
[14:58] during the time of that name all right
[15:00] see then uh you know like you may not
[15:03] find your name
[15:05] in the book I can find Samuel but what
[15:07] good does that do me
[15:09] I mean that doesn't mean that that's my
[15:12] name that was applied to some other
[15:14] Samuel
[15:15] so then I've got to be worried about
[15:17] whether or not I can find my name
[15:19] amen all right now see then the Bible
[15:22] would contain
[15:24] as we'll read in a minute
[15:27] not maybe your name
[15:31] but what would be going on on Earth
[15:34] at the time
[15:36] that your name is represented all right
[15:39] so then it's not as the prophet gave it
[15:43] he said it's not two books
[15:49] he says on works his faith expressed now
[15:52] I didn't pull these up for the brothers
[15:53] because we're doing it Wednesday
[15:55] he said
[15:57] when you get the book you're going to
[15:58] see maybe a little confusion there what
[16:01] I said the two books of life
[16:04] it's the same book but one of them is
[16:07] your natural birth
[16:08] the other one is your spiritual birth
[16:11] one leads out to the other one
[16:15] all right
[16:17] now then the Bible would as I said would
[16:19] contain pharaoh
[16:23] Judas
[16:25] uh you know balaams
[16:27] all of the things
[16:29] but that's not really in the hand of the
[16:32] one sitting on the throne because the
[16:34] names in the book are the ones sitting
[16:35] on the throne
[16:36] is only those to be redeemed
[16:39] all right because everybody else won't
[16:41] accept it right only the redeemed have
[16:44] their names into
[16:46] Lounge Book of Life
[16:48] all right now
[16:50] in dealing with that then we tried to to
[16:53] show a point that
[16:55] see you can say well my name
[16:59] is it in the book
[17:02] well we better find out
[17:04] all right
[17:06] so then the prophet in covering it the
[17:09] even he would say it looks confusing
[17:16] because it would be thinking about two
[17:18] books
[17:19] you know you'd be thinking about the
[17:20] lounge Book of Life in The Book of Life
[17:23] all right now then as he come across he
[17:26] says as we gave Wednesday the invisible
[17:29] Union the bride of Christ paragraph 308.
[17:33] he said the Book of Life is the word of
[17:35] God
[17:37] because the word he is God and God is
[17:40] the only thing that is life so your name
[17:42] was represented in the Bible before the
[17:45] Bible became a word
[17:48] all right
[17:50] I believed and I've always told you that
[17:53] I believe that we have
[17:55] the correct interpretation of the Bible
[17:59] in the King James version I believe that
[18:03] you know you may have some little
[18:06] wordings that would be you'd think would
[18:08] be different but if you went into any
[18:10] other language of the world you'd have a
[18:11] lot of words that you'd think would be
[18:13] different but the point I'm trying to
[18:15] get is
[18:16] the word of God
[18:20] is the eternal
[18:22] life section of that book that was what
[18:25] I was trying to get to Wednesday right
[18:27] all right
[18:29] it's not not just say a Bible upon
[18:32] setting one on the throne got a Bible in
[18:34] his hand
[18:35] no
[18:38] we found out the abstract title deed
[18:41] once Satan entered the picture went back
[18:45] to the hand of almighty God because
[18:47] Satan couldn't take it
[18:49] all right
[18:50] so it goes back to almighty God to be
[18:53] the the abstract title of eat and it
[18:55] would be only names
[18:58] had there not been a had the fall had
[19:01] not taken place
[19:02] you would have only had the point of the
[19:05] redeemable
[19:06] to come into being right
[19:09] all right that's right but see we know
[19:10] the fall did come so when it did but
[19:13] still it wouldn't change that book
[19:16] because they would have been the same
[19:19] amount of names
[19:20] had there not been a fall now I want you
[19:23] to get this point the same amount of
[19:25] names would have been there
[19:26] as it is talk about the lounge Book of
[19:29] Life
[19:30] the Eternal section of the lounge Book
[19:32] of Life the same amount of names would
[19:34] have been there
[19:36] of redeemable had there not been a fall
[19:39] in the same amount of names as here in
[19:41] the point of The Book of Life or the
[19:44] lounge Book of Life
[19:46] because it would be only the redeemed
[19:49] the rest is a natural world
[19:53] the Bible then is a record of mankind
[19:55] all the way from the garden
[19:58] all the way through ending up in the end
[20:00] time
[20:01] coming out to be you know
[20:04] the book in the hand of the one sitting
[20:05] on the throne
[20:07] all right
[20:08] that was the book to be taken remember
[20:10] that book now
[20:12] is sealed with Seven Seals
[20:15] all right and the proclamation went
[20:17] forth Revelations 5 you know who's
[20:19] worthy to come and they said the lion is
[20:22] worthy well when he looked he saw a lamb
[20:25] why because Redemption was going on
[20:28] all right now until that last name
[20:31] if I can get down that far in the
[20:32] message this morning until that life's
[20:35] name
[20:36] comes forth
[20:37] he's got to stay there
[20:41] all right see now if you say like a lot
[20:44] of the people in the message they said
[20:46] where the Redemption was over in 63
[20:47] within 99.99 of what I'm looking at
[20:52] me included would be lost
[20:57] and I gave at least one percent of one
[20:59] percent
[20:59] would it'd probably be 100 of all of us
[21:02] right
[21:06] but the prophet said when the lamb when
[21:08] that life's name
[21:10] said he's got to stay there until that
[21:13] last name
[21:15] is made manifest all right well see then
[21:19] if we believe that there's somebody else
[21:20] to be saved
[21:23] then the Lamb's not left The Mercy Seat
[21:24] as everybody says you know
[21:27] now if he left The Mercy Seat
[21:28] immediately Mercy Seat becomes judgment
[21:30] seat I mean that ought to be sensible so
[21:33] then you're saying in 1963 judgment
[21:35] struck
[21:36] oh that's fancy you know makes people
[21:39] you just don't realize then they're
[21:42] telling you you're lost
[21:45] and the people sitting there enjoying
[21:46] listen oh that's wonderful wonderful of
[21:49] what you're lost
[21:51] because if you wouldn't say before 63
[21:53] and that Doctrine is right then you're
[21:55] lost
[21:58] that's what they told me when the first
[21:59] come in the message I said well I'm
[22:01] sorry
[22:02] according to my Bible and the prophet
[22:04] I'm reading after
[22:07] Redemption was over before the world
[22:08] ever begun
[22:12] that's what Revelation says
[22:16] right so then who's got there's no
[22:18] argument see but that doesn't change
[22:20] anybody
[22:22] but if it's just a point you know
[22:24] but you see church then
[22:28] we've got to see something in this day
[22:32] so if the Book of Life is the word of
[22:34] God as he said
[22:36] and your name was represented in the
[22:39] Bible
[22:41] before the Bible become on word you know
[22:44] what I'm saying and you know what he's
[22:45] saying in other words before it was
[22:47] written
[22:49] because the book and the Hand of the one
[22:51] sitting on the throne is a list of names
[22:53] of the redeemed
[22:57] and they were put there before the world
[22:58] ever begun
[23:00] that's how beautiful it is all right now
[23:03] what we're dealing with and I want to
[23:06] get to two things in a minute
[23:09] I want to cover this right here where
[23:10] you'll think about it but we'll come
[23:12] back to it in a minute in a message now
[23:16] see what you and I are doing
[23:19] is we're just finding out
[23:23] you remember I gave it Wednesday night
[23:25] the prophet said
[23:26] ain't no new name wrote down in heaven
[23:30] he said that's contrary to the Bible he
[23:32] said my name wrote down in heaven today
[23:34] I got born again that's contrary to the
[23:36] Bible
[23:39] no that's not true you say well I've
[23:41] been taught that all my life well it's
[23:43] about time we wake up and get away from
[23:45] what we've been taught
[23:47] it couldn't be a new name written down
[23:50] he was either written there before the
[23:52] foundation world or it never will be
[23:53] there
[23:55] all right
[23:58] so then if we're covering it see it's
[24:01] not a name written down
[24:05] it's finding out that your name is
[24:08] written
[24:10] right
[24:12] now
[24:13] here's what I want to emphasize and I'll
[24:15] do it again in a second
[24:18] when we got
[24:19] we've joined the Baptist Church
[24:21] Methodist Presbyterian Pentecostal et
[24:23] cetera et cetera when you got the new
[24:25] birth in other words
[24:28] we didn't know anything about our names
[24:30] being written on a book of life
[24:33] very few people could even talk about it
[24:36] for a few preachers would even speak
[24:38] about it
[24:39] right
[24:40] so really when did we start thinking
[24:43] about our name being written in the book
[24:45] when we heard this message
[24:47] right
[24:49] we may have read those things I'll get
[24:51] back to that in a minute
[24:53] we're reading something
[24:55] is not a revelation
[24:58] it's when it's revealed to you
[25:01] the word's not alive until
[25:03] the Holy Ghost quickens it right all
[25:06] right now
[25:07] so then
[25:09] if it's finding our name written see
[25:12] this message
[25:14] this end time message
[25:18] is is showing us that our names are
[25:20] there
[25:22] that's the message that's what the
[25:24] prophet came to do
[25:25] all right so it's not fine not saying my
[25:28] my name was written down today I got
[25:30] born again no that's good Baptist
[25:33] Doctrine
[25:35] then they got that little card that
[25:37] anywhere you go they mail that thing
[25:39] with you that tells everybody where you
[25:41] got born again at and you know and how
[25:44] you remember in good standing or if
[25:45] you're not in a member and good standing
[25:47] because I used to be there and we had
[25:50] send some you know
[25:52] because you go anywhere out west and you
[25:54] go join a church you just call back they
[25:57] send that little card
[25:58] so they think when your name was written
[26:00] on that little card it's written down in
[26:02] heaven
[26:04] knows even the prophet said either
[26:05] written before the foundational world or
[26:07] it'll never be written
[26:11] see because his fore knowledge will let
[26:13] him know
[26:14] all right
[26:16] so then when he gets to Invisible Union
[26:20] he makes a statement that sounds odd in
[26:22] putting these two together now
[26:25] that you're finding out that your name
[26:27] is written
[26:30] right finding out by the reveal word
[26:34] by the end time prophets message we're
[26:36] finding out it our name is written
[26:39] in the last book of life
[26:41] all right
[26:43] so then watch what he said when he gets
[26:45] to the invisible Union
[26:47] he said your old book is gone paragraph
[26:49] 2 2 3 2 23 224 they didn't get this
[26:54] either now
[26:56] says your old book is gone with your old
[26:58] Union
[27:00] now your name in your old
[27:03] in your has been transferred
[27:08] and you say do you mean to tell me that
[27:10] my old book
[27:12] God put it in the sea of his
[27:13] forgetfulness
[27:15] what is your old book
[27:20] your old life right
[27:23] so now you see then we come over into
[27:25] the book because Paul said that we were
[27:27] lost
[27:29] we need to be saved
[27:31] Paul said we had our time in past as
[27:34] other gentiles
[27:36] me lost all right
[27:39] so now the going with the old book is
[27:42] what your old nature in your old ways
[27:45] but he said it's been transferred well
[27:48] see that looks like to us transferred
[27:50] means well it was over here and we'll
[27:52] race it out and put it over here
[27:55] we'll see then that's adding a name
[27:59] so that wouldn't be correct
[28:01] right
[28:03] but if you can see it a race here you
[28:05] can see
[28:06] he transferred it he's the one that does
[28:09] the work not you and I
[28:12] and we see our name
[28:15] we see our name written
[28:18] in The Book of Life
[28:20] the whole Union is gone listen what he
[28:22] says now your name is now in this new
[28:25] book
[28:29] not the Book of Life
[28:32] but the lounge Book of Life
[28:36] all right so the book of life is what
[28:39] the Natural Life of mankind
[28:42] right that's your two books
[28:45] it's not two books it's the same book
[28:47] different sections right
[28:52] he said now your name is now in the new
[28:55] book
[28:56] not the book of life but the lounge Book
[28:58] of Life what the lamb redeemed not the
[29:01] old book of your natural Union
[29:05] what's he talking about your natural
[29:07] birth your natural doing
[29:10] but your new bride Hallelujah
[29:13] your new life is in the lounge Book of
[29:16] Life
[29:17] your marriage certificate how Hallelujah
[29:20] were your true Eternal germ from the
[29:23] beginning takes hold
[29:25] all right
[29:28] now are you getting the point of what
[29:30] I'm saying
[29:31] there's not a new name written down
[29:35] it's finding out your name
[29:40] is in that book
[29:42] all right
[29:45] now not trying to find your name like
[29:47] Gary Atkins I mean
[29:50] and then turn around and spell it just a
[29:52] little bit different and get Gary Krantz
[29:57] see now you got the Gary spell two
[29:59] different ways maybe or something see
[30:01] you it's not that
[30:06] it's the day and the hour that we're
[30:08] living in the word we'll get to that in
[30:09] a minute and cover it but I'm trying to
[30:11] get you to look at it see then your name
[30:13] is not transferred like it was over here
[30:15] raced out and put over here
[30:20] now that be putting a new name so you
[30:21] can do what you want to about it
[30:24] but if you look at it with the two
[30:25] quotes together see you're realizing
[30:27] your name is dire
[30:30] by this message we realize that old
[30:32] nature in that old ways is gone
[30:35] by the new birth
[30:38] all right then we see our name
[30:40] there
[30:46] so we can say it was transferred
[30:50] but it's not transferred
[30:53] you get what I mean if you transfer
[30:55] something you take it out of that space
[30:56] and you put it in another space
[31:00] really the word transferred is changed
[31:04] look it up changed
[31:07] you got to run it on down through it it
[31:09] also means a conveyance of right or
[31:13] title
[31:16] conveyance of right or title
[31:19] you know all right
[31:22] so it's transferred
[31:26] but not erased not a hole over here and
[31:30] put it over into here
[31:33] it was either there before the
[31:34] foundation World it won't be there
[31:35] according to the prophet in the Bible
[31:36] how many quotes do you need on that part
[31:38] of it
[31:41] see then church what are we talking
[31:43] about
[31:45] now listen to the point
[31:51] see I want it revealed to me
[31:55] we'll read where the Prophet says is my
[31:58] name there is your name there we'll read
[32:01] where he says John's name was Dire and
[32:03] Elijah's name was there
[32:08] but I want to know if my name's there
[32:12] all right
[32:16] and I want to find out how it got there
[32:19] you know they said name is the greatest
[32:21] thing in the world because you can be in
[32:23] a crowd of a million people and somebody
[32:25] say dick Addison
[32:28] well he's not looking for forty thousand
[32:30] other dick Addison's
[32:34] he's listening to The Voice
[32:37] now
[32:39] so think about it now trying to get over
[32:41] from where we were
[32:44] because the Bible contains the names
[32:49] not of every name written out you know
[32:53] but this Bible contains the names
[32:58] now listen to where I'm saying it
[33:00] of everybody that would ever be in the
[33:03] world
[33:05] because it gives you
[33:07] a day a time a section this the Old
[33:11] Testament was lived through the New
[33:12] Testament the Ages was lived through
[33:14] everything lived through right in the
[33:16] Bible you said well what about the ages
[33:17] go to Revelations two and three and
[33:19] you've got the ages written in
[33:23] life
[33:25] the Bible is not just
[33:29] deeds and thoughts
[33:32] it's a revelation
[33:34] of God
[33:36] living in mankind
[33:39] down through time
[33:41] are you following me
[33:43] all right
[33:45] now then
[33:48] you wouldn't be writing a new name
[33:54] but you're finding out your name is
[33:56] already there and did you notice the
[33:57] statement I mean I said everybody in the
[33:59] world's name is in this Bible
[34:03] yes a seven billion today
[34:06] you know with everyone in this Bible
[34:08] you want to read it turn to Revelation 3
[34:10] and read read the seventh Church age
[34:14] right
[34:16] it's not a night let's let's listen to
[34:19] me oh my way now don't be silly
[34:24] we'll read in a second where the Prophet
[34:25] said is what's going on for the age
[34:28] all right
[34:30] but I want that in your mind to think
[34:31] about it
[34:33] that this Bible contains
[34:38] the names of people
[34:41] but we've got to be able to find it
[34:45] they got these coded things they can
[34:47] figure out you know and they got the
[34:49] coded things about this and the coded
[34:51] things about that and the secret code I
[34:53] don't know about that but you remember
[34:55] one of those guys over in Egypt there
[34:57] somewhere somebody figured it out and
[34:59] and wrote it and said he's going to get
[35:00] killed and he did
[35:02] he had the Bible he said to prove it
[35:04] with well that's all right no problem I
[35:08] ain't trying to figure out no secret
[35:09] code
[35:11] and you better not either
[35:14] gotta remember my story about it there's
[35:17] a guy used to get a newspaper a day
[35:18] ahead of time
[35:22] boy he's doing good
[35:24] he could play the stock market he could
[35:26] play the horse races he could bet on
[35:28] anything he wanted to because he already
[35:30] knew what's going to happen
[35:32] but one day he read the obituary
[35:35] he found out he died the day before
[35:40] well let's don't try to play with the
[35:41] Bible
[35:42] if you're following me
[35:46] trying to find a name to her as a name
[35:50] of
[35:52] Richard Marlowe
[35:55] that's not in the Bible
[35:58] all right
[36:01] but yet God says it's in there
[36:04] all right
[36:06] now follow what I'm saying go ahead with
[36:08] number one we'll just get it because I
[36:09] quoted a lot to you
[36:11] but look what the prophet of God says
[36:13] about this
[36:19] this is taken some questions and answers
[36:21] on the seals uh 63 324 in the morning
[36:24] service paragraph 112.
[36:27] brother Branham is the lounge Book of
[36:29] Life and the Book of Life the same book
[36:33] sure
[36:36] I love you
[36:38] because that's where all redemptions
[36:41] wrote In This Book
[36:44] now what's he talking about
[36:47] the only one one book I know of that all
[36:49] Redemption can be concerned is the Bible
[36:52] right
[36:55] their names are in you say well uh our
[36:57] names put on the Lamb's Book of Life
[37:00] I got it put on the other night
[37:03] no you didn't
[37:05] no you didn't
[37:06] you just found out it was on there the
[37:09] other night
[37:11] because their names were written before
[37:13] the foundation of the world see that's
[37:15] it's all the same book
[37:18] all right so it's two sections one book
[37:23] the Bible tells you about the natural
[37:25] things of life
[37:27] you go in there and read it it says uh
[37:29] that they stood before the Watergate and
[37:31] read the word
[37:32] well this message came before Watergate
[37:34] came into being
[37:35] oh and it says in the scriptures that
[37:37] the time that they'll be that the towers
[37:40] will fall
[37:41] well all right we could put that with
[37:42] the Towers falling in our day
[37:46] it's in new here we can read it that all
[37:48] these great things things are supposed
[37:50] to happen these earthquakes these um
[37:52] typhoons these everything we're in the
[37:55] last days because the Bible says that
[37:58] well we're studying it in the right form
[38:01] right
[38:02] but now look
[38:07] what your Prophet says go to the next
[38:09] one just to get these in your mind
[38:13] he's talking about his name you know not
[38:15] written in Atlanta Book of Life and
[38:16] Foundation world when was your name put
[38:18] on the book of life before we ever had a
[38:21] world you were chosen to receive the
[38:23] Holy Ghost in This age
[38:27] now if you don't need nothing else to
[38:29] put your book name in the book
[38:32] there it is
[38:34] but we quote these things
[38:38] is it a quote or is it a revelation
[38:43] which one is it
[38:47] is it a quote that we go to Revelations
[38:49] 13 8 and all that dwell upon the Earth
[38:52] shall worship Him whose names were not
[38:54] written in the Book of Life of the lamb
[38:56] slain from the foundation world
[38:59] is that a quote
[39:01] or is it a revelation
[39:05] which one is it
[39:08] is the next one the second Corinthians
[39:11] three and six
[39:12] well also hath made us able Ministers of
[39:15] the New Testament
[39:16] not of the letter but of the spirit for
[39:20] the letter killeth
[39:21] the spirit giveth life
[39:24] it is just letters on the page
[39:26] quotes
[39:28] well the prophet said that's what we'll
[39:31] get that done
[39:33] Prophet said he saw me there
[39:36] all right I'm sorry that I'm just that
[39:39] old arrogant guy that has to come up
[39:41] with a wrong answer
[39:45] he was in hell and he was in heaven
[39:46] where did he see you at
[39:49] right of course you don't want that do
[39:51] you
[39:52] no no he saw me in heaven
[39:54] well then why don't we act heavenly
[40:03] remember whatever we are here is what we
[40:06] are there whatever we are there and
[40:09] whatever we are here
[40:15] well they needed a quote to us
[40:19] foreign
[40:24] you know Moses
[40:26] was a pretty good guy
[40:30] he was told by his mother
[40:32] I know you got the videos and the movies
[40:34] you see then he was on up you know he
[40:37] didn't find it out until he was 40 years
[40:38] old or something
[40:40] but remember your Prophet said his mama
[40:42] told him
[40:43] well he said on her knee
[40:46] that you are not the son of child and
[40:48] Ella Branham
[40:51] right in the wrong names right
[40:56] you're not
[40:58] never who Moses Mom and Daddy was
[41:01] their names you're not that
[41:05] you're not Pharaoh's daughter either you
[41:07] know from her
[41:09] you're a special chosen you say why
[41:11] don't you say it that way
[41:12] because wasn't he
[41:14] oh yeah we put him down as to be the
[41:16] child also and so and so and so
[41:20] but you know really he was chosen before
[41:22] the world right
[41:26] I'm trying to get you to see a
[41:27] revelation instead of natural words
[41:32] all right
[41:33] man and Moses heard that all of his life
[41:39] you know what
[41:41] he one day finally figured out
[41:44] oh this
[41:45] I've been told this by my mama
[41:48] she's raised me I know who I am
[41:51] so I'll go out and deliver the children
[41:53] of Israel
[41:56] they failed didn't he
[41:59] yeah
[42:01] Mama's Revelation wasn't enough
[42:05] made a failure
[42:07] all right
[42:10] but you know one day at a burning bush
[42:13] he got a revelation
[42:18] had he stayed down in Egypt
[42:22] to start with he could have probably
[42:24] caused a pretty good Insurrection he was
[42:26] the head of the of the armies the
[42:28] militaries and and everything he could
[42:30] have caused a coop
[42:31] you know to be taken over and he could
[42:33] have took over but that wasn't God's way
[42:34] of doing it right
[42:37] so
[42:39] put in a burning bush
[42:43] he got a revelation of who he was
[42:47] right
[42:48] now say he saw his name in the book
[42:51] you know
[42:53] he's part of God's economy now
[42:57] whereas Moses the soldier was not a part
[43:01] of the economy of God
[43:03] but now Moses the man with a stick
[43:07] going to Egypt to take over he's got a
[43:08] revelation
[43:13] my point is what
[43:16] are we leaving off of quotes or
[43:18] scriptures or whatever or what somebody
[43:21] says or are we gonna
[43:23] and we got a revelation
[43:27] you know Abraham was told
[43:31] in his early life when God first met him
[43:36] your seed
[43:38] will possess
[43:40] the Gate of the enemy
[43:43] right
[43:47] but you know one day
[43:50] that became personal to him
[43:53] it was revealed to him
[43:57] he confessed it for 25 years
[44:01] right
[44:02] pretty good confession
[44:07] but you say well now now brother Dale
[44:09] well now let me just get into scripture
[44:12] just to her
[44:14] remember he was trying to kind of
[44:18] deal with God
[44:21] because he said duh
[44:23] you know let Ishmael
[44:27] stand before you
[44:29] right
[44:31] now don't you think he kind of
[44:34] I don't come on I know the scripture
[44:36] that Abraham doubted not
[44:40] but go back in his natural life and read
[44:42] it
[44:44] he was trying to get God to let Ishmael
[44:46] be the I mean you know this won't be the
[44:49] one instead of Isaac
[44:51] but you know one day it dawned on him
[44:53] hey that ain't it because God met him
[44:55] and said the Covenant is not with Hagar
[45:00] not with Ishmael
[45:02] Mercedes with Sarah
[45:06] and said that's going to be the child
[45:07] coming from there
[45:10] you know what he could produce a child
[45:12] in
[45:14] we were listening to a tape the other
[45:15] day and I thought
[45:19] how marvelous a prophet could be
[45:22] and he was talking about Jacob you
[45:23] remember in his journey
[45:26] and read your Bible about Genesis 31
[45:28] there
[45:31] and he said Jacob
[45:33] get up take your family go home
[45:37] he said I'll bless you
[45:42] well he gets up takes his family if he
[45:45] don't find out that it's
[45:47] well I've kind of stole for stuff from
[45:49] Daddy and none brought it along with him
[45:52] but
[45:54] brother said Barry gets out so far and
[45:56] said
[45:58] he's got I can't remember his name what
[46:00] is it blame it sure what his name is
[46:02] he said there he is
[46:04] then his daddy lost behind him
[46:07] wanting to kill him about his idols
[46:10] if she carried off
[46:15] and said Esau's in front of him
[46:20] but said God had already told him
[46:25] Jacob
[46:27] go home
[46:29] I'll be with you
[46:31] well you know he didn't believe that
[46:33] until he met an angel of the Lord one
[46:36] night and he wrestled with him for a
[46:37] while and
[46:38] he come out of there he was limping but
[46:40] he had a revelation
[46:42] sure he still respected Esau and
[46:46] everything else
[46:49] but yet he wasn't afraid
[46:54] what about it
[46:58] has it been revealed to us
[47:01] what the prophet has said to us now laid
[47:05] the foundation with that that we didn't
[47:07] even think about her name being in the
[47:08] Book of Life
[47:10] we didn't think about that when it was
[47:11] an organized religion
[47:14] but when we come in this message
[47:17] but did that put my name there
[47:21] no
[47:24] I just found out it was there
[47:29] but the prophet preaching it to me
[47:32] because my name was either put there
[47:33] before the foundation World it will
[47:35] never be
[47:37] right man brother Dale I just ain't got
[47:39] no hopes uh let's see I believe I got it
[47:41] in here where he says it you say well
[47:44] we'll brought around today but one going
[47:45] out of Jeffersonville you remember that
[47:47] same statement like that
[47:50] he said well then I got to believe I'm
[47:51] that one
[47:54] they were one going down to Georgia I'm
[47:56] sorry for the rest of y'all you got to
[47:57] find you another state
[48:00] because I done got to
[48:02] you know my claims on that but you know
[48:04] what you got to believe
[48:06] that you're the only one and I got to
[48:08] find me another state right sister Gayle
[48:11] you got to believe for yourself
[48:13] you understand what I'm talking about
[48:15] we can talk about a name being written
[48:17] in the Lamb's Book of Life
[48:19] we can talk about in quote
[48:22] how it gets there
[48:25] we can go through the prophet's message
[48:27] of How It's your name is written in the
[48:28] Book of Life at sanctification
[48:32] and you can see that Judas iscaris name
[48:35] was even in the Book of Life
[48:37] but remember it was not in the Eternal
[48:39] section
[48:42] so thereby his name could be removed
[48:47] the prophet said as a matter of fact if
[48:49] we don't repent it's not even on there
[48:53] what about those that their names are
[48:55] written nowhere you've got four
[48:56] classifications in the church age book
[48:59] if you'll read that 268 backwards and
[49:01] four you'll read it
[49:05] somebody whose names is in the last book
[49:06] of life can never be removed someone
[49:08] whose name is in the Book of Life
[49:11] like Judas and their names can be
[49:13] removed
[49:15] some of whose names will be added later
[49:20] all right and some whose names were
[49:23] written over
[49:26] all right
[49:27] but you say what but no no no God don't
[49:31] have to have a record
[49:34] here's his record
[49:37] you don't have to have no stamps with
[49:41] you know a record down through there you
[49:43] know and a list of names
[49:47] all right
[49:48] so now think about it
[49:54] are you getting the point it's got to be
[49:56] revealed
[49:57] all right
[50:01] it was put on there before the
[50:02] foundation of the world or it'll never
[50:04] be put to our
[50:07] it comes up the end of thinking about
[50:09] this little point that was asked the
[50:10] prophet go ahead with number five
[50:13] which is questions and answers on the
[50:15] seals 1963.
[50:21] and they're asking him a question about
[50:22] is ever true Jew born since Christ came
[50:25] came will be saved you know 140
[50:29] and he's got he said there's three
[50:30] questions is it true that ever born Jew
[50:33] born since Christ they came into the
[50:35] world is to be saved no
[50:38] nothing will be saved only those whose
[50:41] names were put on the lounge book of
[50:43] life before the foundation of the world
[50:44] you are Gentile see that's all
[50:48] the book holds that mystery
[50:51] and the book is only unfolding it
[50:56] now
[51:00] not each one's name
[51:03] but what the mystery of the book is
[51:07] while it's calling those names
[51:11] you got it
[51:14] well puts your name in the book
[51:20] so then the first church age was in the
[51:22] Bible
[51:25] but then one day it became on a book was
[51:27] written
[51:30] second Church age Etc right
[51:32] why because there's a mystery
[51:36] we better be concerned about the mystery
[51:40] Martin Luther had a mystery of the just
[51:42] shall live by faith
[51:46] Martin or Luther needed one is in the
[51:49] Bible in the point of a name right
[51:53] but when the judge shall live by faith
[51:56] is involved
[52:00] that put Luther's name right in the book
[52:03] not looking for a name of writing out a
[52:06] name
[52:08] look for what's going on in the hour
[52:10] that we're living
[52:11] all right
[52:15] the book doesn't say now levale is to be
[52:18] saved in time of this church age or or
[52:21] Arman Neville or whoever
[52:24] know it don't say that it just shows the
[52:27] mystery unfolds the mystery of what the
[52:30] thing is
[52:32] but we ourselves by faith believe it
[52:37] that's what I said the other night
[52:39] someone said well there's no need
[52:42] in me trying it brother Branham
[52:45] said there's only
[52:47] going to be one saved out of
[52:49] Jeffersonville
[52:50] see now see it's showing a parable
[52:54] that that isn't it that that isn't it
[52:57] there might be thousands saved I don't
[53:00] know I hope every one of them is saved
[53:02] see but I don't know but here's the way
[53:05] I want to believe it I'm that one
[53:09] you believe the same for you if you
[53:13] don't
[53:16] see people that say well I know brother
[53:18] Branham is going to be there but I don't
[53:19] know about me
[53:25] you know I'm sorry sometimes I can read
[53:28] oh
[53:34] you say I'm the one
[53:37] you believe that same for you if you
[53:39] don't and there's something wrong with
[53:42] your faith
[53:43] you're not sure
[53:45] what you're doing
[53:50] you're going to argue with your prophet
[53:53] well we know I'm sure I believe Brothers
[53:54] going to be there but I'll read you a
[53:56] quote in a minute where wrote around and
[53:57] said I don't know where I will or not I
[53:59] believe it will
[54:01] you know he had to live by faith
[54:05] right
[54:07] so think about it now
[54:11] think about what we're trying to say
[54:15] not each one's name not levielle Samuel
[54:18] Dale anybody James Cauley whatever it's
[54:22] not that away
[54:24] it's the mystery of the hour that we're
[54:26] living
[54:29] all right
[54:31] The Mystery of the hour that we're
[54:34] living in
[54:35] the word for this hour
[54:37] Paul said the mystery whereof I'm called
[54:40] now what was his call to preach to
[54:43] preach the mystery
[54:45] which was Christ The Mystery of God
[54:46] revealed right
[54:49] that's why I called him to preach not
[54:51] some rooster up in a tree crowing
[54:54] her mom and dad said calling him and
[54:56] daddy sending him
[55:00] what's wrong with the preachers
[55:02] well brother Dale my call was when I
[55:05] Heard a Voice well amen
[55:10] let's just make sure it's the right
[55:11] voice
[55:16] now think about it
[55:19] see we want to lay a lot of things on to
[55:22] other people
[55:25] we said I know I'm going to be there
[55:27] because I love the prophet's children
[55:29] brother told me that one day
[55:32] he said I pray for his family
[55:33] continually and said I know I'm going to
[55:35] be there
[55:37] well now is that the only reason he's
[55:39] going to be there
[55:43] you see what I'm getting at
[55:47] y'all gotta have something to prop up
[55:49] for beings with right
[55:53] you know you never ask a person a
[55:54] question they don't give you some form
[55:55] of answer
[55:59] we said well we know brother Brown's
[56:00] name is in the book A Lot he said he
[56:02] didn't know he lived by faith
[56:06] we don't want that quoted
[56:10] when we say John
[56:14] they run around and said John's name was
[56:15] there
[56:20] well that's a pretty good point
[56:26] but how did John's name wind up being
[56:28] there
[56:29] was either John over here
[56:32] and then John goes to Patmos
[56:34] and then John's up in heaven
[56:37] I wish I was sure his name was there
[56:38] well I believe it was too
[56:40] all right
[56:41] but you know John had to live by faith
[56:45] you know that John after being born
[56:47] again for 60 years
[56:49] because you calculate from 30
[56:52] or 33 everywhere you want to start
[56:54] when the Holy Ghost fell
[56:57] in about 93 John was on Patmos 93 94 95.
[57:02] that's 60 years according to my
[57:04] calculations that John had already had
[57:06] the Holy Ghost
[57:08] and because in Revelations 5 that he
[57:10] couldn't see a lamb to take the book he
[57:13] was crying like everything
[57:23] we better be doing a little bit of
[57:24] crying folks
[57:26] and get concerned
[57:29] now listen to what your Prophet has to
[57:30] say about John go ahead with number six
[57:33] is taken for the breach between the
[57:36] church ages and the seals 63 317
[57:39] paragraph 297. what a jubilee going on
[57:42] in heaven when that the lamb leads
[57:45] leaves that intercessory box
[57:48] to come to possess his claim
[57:51] you know what that got next to John
[57:55] he must have saw his name wrote dark
[58:02] then he tells your word
[58:04] that he found it from
[58:06] when the seals broke
[58:08] he must have got real happy
[58:10] listen he said
[58:12] and he said remember he said every
[58:13] creature in heaven he didn't hear every
[58:14] creature saying
[58:16] he said every creature in heaven haven't
[58:18] heard him saying
[58:20] that's right
[58:21] you're a creature run around and
[58:23] explained it John said they heard him
[58:27] one because he found a redeemer
[58:30] he said John Musta
[58:33] saw his name wrote there
[58:37] well
[58:40] that would be all right and that'd be
[58:41] for John
[58:45] and we can go through the story of
[58:47] producing the show that surely John did
[58:50] because remember in Revelations 5 there
[58:52] was 24 elders
[58:55] there were 12 Apostles and 12 Patriarchs
[58:58] and John would have been one of those 12
[59:00] right
[59:01] so when you get on over about 19
[59:03] somewhere in there you'll find out the
[59:05] foundations the gates and all of these
[59:07] things and the names in them and John
[59:10] surely by the time he gets over the in
[59:12] the Book of Revelation he done found out
[59:13] my names are
[59:14] but did he know his name was there that
[59:16] way or did he know it by revelation
[59:23] which one was it
[59:26] there's plenty of John's
[59:30] right
[59:32] but you see we've got a pretty good case
[59:34] to bring because he was one of the 12
[59:36] apostles
[59:41] his name is there
[59:43] but my point is is that what he's
[59:46] building on or was it in other words why
[59:49] didn't he in 60 years
[59:51] see a little bit of something about his
[59:53] name
[59:57] and if he believed his name was Dire why
[1:00:00] was he crying for a redeemer
[1:00:05] come on
[1:00:11] see evidently he there's something a
[1:00:13] little bit lacking there wouldn't it
[1:00:18] but then one day he got a revelation
[1:00:20] didn't he
[1:00:22] now when you come back from Patmos he
[1:00:24] didn't have no problem
[1:00:26] he said hi John I say you and this
[1:00:30] I've seen love I've seen it to the right
[1:00:32] of
[1:00:33] this is where it is you know I've seen
[1:00:34] the Antichrist
[1:00:37] he began to realize who he was look at
[1:00:39] the next one which is paragraph 303 of
[1:00:41] the of the breach
[1:00:43] that's what we call it the breach
[1:00:45] between the seven Church ages and Seven
[1:00:46] Seals
[1:00:49] talk about a happy time when them seals
[1:00:52] broke
[1:00:54] John must have looked in and seen a past
[1:00:56] a curtain of time
[1:00:57] and said there's John
[1:01:00] oh he was so happy he said everything in
[1:01:02] heaven he must have really cried out
[1:01:04] didn't he
[1:01:09] look at the next one the fourth seal
[1:01:11] preached in 1963-323.
[1:01:14] paragraph 364.
[1:01:17] look
[1:01:20] Elijah
[1:01:21] never knew even one of them was that way
[1:01:25] now who's he talking about
[1:01:28] nothing running around him now Elijah
[1:01:30] he thought he was the only one saved
[1:01:33] until God opened one of the seals and
[1:01:36] showed him the mystery of the book
[1:01:39] that's uh the Elijah number one
[1:01:44] right
[1:01:47] now number one was the guy was that
[1:01:49] thought he was the only one saved
[1:01:53] now look
[1:01:55] God opened one of the seals and showed
[1:01:57] him the mystery of the book
[1:01:58] that he had 700 that had never bowed
[1:02:01] down to them Creeds you remember seven
[1:02:03] thousand remember where he was quoted
[1:02:05] but they had when God opened his book to
[1:02:09] Elijah
[1:02:13] he said now wait a minute son
[1:02:16] I got 700 that's tucked around out there
[1:02:19] got their names on the book since the
[1:02:21] foundation of the world they're mine
[1:02:23] sweet he said God opened the seals
[1:02:27] that's the reason I think John was doing
[1:02:29] all that shouting jumping over to John
[1:02:33] right
[1:02:34] the other night he must have seen his
[1:02:36] name on dire you see see one day God
[1:02:39] opened
[1:02:43] but now listen
[1:02:49] well let's go into the next one because
[1:02:51] I want to get these
[1:02:53] look to harvest time
[1:02:56] preaching 64 1212 paragraph 127 28 29
[1:03:03] it was at the meeting the other night
[1:03:04] that little assembly brother Assembly of
[1:03:07] God brother and sister sang that song I
[1:03:10] wonder if John saw me when he saw all
[1:03:12] the nations gathered
[1:03:15] did he see me sure
[1:03:17] he did if your name
[1:03:21] was on that book
[1:03:24] and when John's name was on it too and
[1:03:28] he went because there was nobody that
[1:03:30] could touch it and then one of the
[1:03:32] elders come and said we've not John for
[1:03:34] the line of the tribe of Judah has
[1:03:35] prevailed
[1:03:36] John was looking around trying to find a
[1:03:39] line what happened to lamb come forth he
[1:03:41] come and took the book out of the right
[1:03:42] hand of him
[1:03:44] and called
[1:03:46] everything
[1:03:48] what was on that book
[1:03:51] it's The Complete Book of redemption
[1:03:56] you're going to read in between the book
[1:03:57] of redemption and the things
[1:03:59] look what he said
[1:04:01] you have no ending of life if your name
[1:04:03] is on that book
[1:04:05] the lamb come to redeem it not all that
[1:04:08] professes Christians that profess
[1:04:11] Christians
[1:04:12] not all that try to live good and holy
[1:04:15] but those whose names were written on
[1:04:18] our
[1:04:19] he redeemed that and that alone
[1:04:22] whose names were on the book
[1:04:26] no
[1:04:31] if you notice
[1:04:33] there's a key here that I want you to
[1:04:35] remember
[1:04:39] but around said when God opened one of
[1:04:41] the seals John saw his name
[1:04:47] he said when Elijah God opened one of
[1:04:49] the seals
[1:04:51] John saw his name
[1:04:56] he said well brother Dale the Seal's
[1:04:58] never opened to Elijah back there
[1:05:07] did not Elijah how the revelation of the
[1:05:09] word for his age
[1:05:12] am I right
[1:05:13] then that's part of the word right
[1:05:17] have you ever noticed brother random
[1:05:19] about six times
[1:05:21] says that Daniel heard the Thunders
[1:05:24] and was forbidden to write it's five
[1:05:27] somewhere right in there
[1:05:28] times
[1:05:32] he said John heard the Thunders
[1:05:36] and was forbidden to write
[1:05:42] and brother Branham heard the Thunders
[1:05:46] and we have it now written to tell us
[1:05:47] what they are what are the Thunders
[1:05:49] brother Dale your Prophet said it about
[1:05:52] 158 of the seal book that's the old seal
[1:05:54] book
[1:05:59] he said the Thunder's the voice of God
[1:06:00] when the seal broke
[1:06:05] so now you said but yeah but but but I
[1:06:07] don't know Elijah
[1:06:11] this one brought to him
[1:06:14] he said God opened one of the seals
[1:06:19] and Elijah saw his name
[1:06:26] now I asked the question
[1:06:33] if our names is in the book we should
[1:06:35] have enough quotes to show
[1:06:37] that if it's in the book let's put on
[1:06:38] there before the foundation of the world
[1:06:40] everybody agree with that it is I'll try
[1:06:42] to bypass a bunch of quotes
[1:06:50] our names were written before the
[1:06:52] foundation of the world or they will not
[1:06:54] be written
[1:06:59] now come on come on folks you think well
[1:07:01] these dummies they don't understand
[1:07:02] anything
[1:07:04] they will be according to the church age
[1:07:06] book a future compilation of names after
[1:07:09] the world is over with and why throwing
[1:07:11] judgment so
[1:07:14] we not do that is I know those sarcastic
[1:07:16] ones are sitting out they don't know
[1:07:18] what they're talking about
[1:07:20] there's a compilation sometimes or
[1:07:22] whatever when he died I got that one
[1:07:26] listen Church
[1:07:28] is it just quotes to us
[1:07:34] now let me explain a little point
[1:07:40] if John according to the prophet
[1:07:46] had the virtues of the Statue of a
[1:07:48] perfect man
[1:07:49] all except the headstone
[1:07:52] now do you need them I'll be glad to get
[1:07:53] them for you if you don't reach natural
[1:07:55] perfect man you'll find it and then
[1:07:59] you none of those disciples had the
[1:08:01] headstone
[1:08:03] this love they had this down through
[1:08:05] here
[1:08:07] that's your prophet he said The
[1:08:08] Headstone hasn't come yet
[1:08:12] but yet they
[1:08:15] did from this Holy Spirit down
[1:08:18] and it was called the face of the
[1:08:19] fathers
[1:08:21] right
[1:08:23] all right
[1:08:25] John stood with the faith of the fathers
[1:08:29] he was capable of writing
[1:08:31] The Book of John
[1:08:35] then chosen to go to Patmos
[1:08:38] to write the Book of Revelation it must
[1:08:40] have been a very special guy
[1:08:43] chosen over all if you'll get into your
[1:08:45] Matthew Mark Luke and John you'll find
[1:08:47] that you're lying the ox a man the eagle
[1:08:49] will come totally compare with that that
[1:08:51] your Prophet has taught us so then the
[1:08:54] line would be Matthew
[1:08:57] the mark of the ox
[1:09:00] man
[1:09:02] the next and then the eagle John was the
[1:09:05] eagle of the Bible read your Bible he's
[1:09:08] more prophetic in his writing of the
[1:09:10] Book of John than the others are
[1:09:15] because he was a prophet he was chosen
[1:09:16] for that position
[1:09:18] he goes to Pat must to receive the
[1:09:20] revelation
[1:09:22] he asked the faith of the fathers
[1:09:26] he has everything that's been revealed
[1:09:30] and by then he had already heard
[1:09:34] of Paul
[1:09:36] and said under his ministry probably
[1:09:43] and he could probably say like
[1:09:47] was it Peter that Paul said things hard
[1:09:50] to be understood
[1:09:52] but yet he was chosen Paul wasn't chosen
[1:09:54] to go to Patmos
[1:09:57] John was because he was prophetic
[1:10:00] he could understand the symbols better
[1:10:03] all right
[1:10:04] but he goes down with the baptism of the
[1:10:06] Holy Ghost
[1:10:09] and when a proclamation comes forth
[1:10:13] it must be a redeemer
[1:10:15] don't you think he could give up and
[1:10:17] give him a great message on the Redeemer
[1:10:19] of Jesus Christ being God Almighty and
[1:10:22] human flesh
[1:10:27] no he was just straight and honest
[1:10:30] that would help you and I if we do it
[1:10:33] instead of being so super revelated
[1:10:37] to be straight and honest
[1:10:41] John says if there ain't somebody that
[1:10:43] can come and take this book All Is Lost
[1:10:51] he sure was rejoicing when he come to
[1:10:52] find out there was somebody worthy
[1:10:56] amen don't you think he could remember
[1:10:58] what he wrote in his own or at least one
[1:11:00] of the other writers wrote that when
[1:11:02] John the Baptist introduced Jesus and
[1:11:04] said to the Lamb of God to take away the
[1:11:07] sin of the world
[1:11:10] that you think he could stand forth and
[1:11:12] say Glory Hallelujah I know who that
[1:11:14] lamb is
[1:11:17] but there was something about that lamb
[1:11:20] that John didn't understand
[1:11:24] why do you need a lamb over here on the
[1:11:26] River Jordan
[1:11:28] and you didn't lamb in the end time to
[1:11:30] open the word
[1:11:34] why is it that lamb back there has only
[1:11:36] got one two horns and two eyes
[1:11:40] but this lamb that comes over in
[1:11:42] Revelations 5 he's got seven horns
[1:11:45] and seven eyes
[1:11:47] the prophet said he come from the church
[1:11:49] ages
[1:11:52] the church agency was Son of God
[1:11:54] folks This is 40 something years
[1:11:56] preaching this so don't think that I
[1:11:59] don't know what I'm talking about
[1:12:04] in Revelations 5 he's got seven horns
[1:12:06] and seven eyes
[1:12:09] that's that seed of the woman I kept
[1:12:12] trying to get to you the other day to
[1:12:13] show you that the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:12:15] is so close to God in the end time until
[1:12:17] he does not separate himself from it and
[1:12:20] he declares her as being the bride and
[1:12:22] being the lamb
[1:12:26] we are him make manifests
[1:12:31] there is no Redemption outside of this
[1:12:34] message
[1:12:36] that doesn't mean people can't get saved
[1:12:38] out there they'll come to this as quick
[1:12:39] as they can
[1:12:41] all right
[1:12:43] but listen
[1:12:48] think about it
[1:12:51] it's not just
[1:12:56] it's the book that's sealed in heaven
[1:12:59] the mystery to seal
[1:13:01] is my name to our paragraph 299
[1:13:04] I don't know
[1:13:07] I hope it is
[1:13:10] but if it is it was put on the book
[1:13:12] before the foundation of the world
[1:13:14] now that's your prophet
[1:13:20] you see folks what we've got to do is
[1:13:22] realize one thing as I said about Moses
[1:13:27] Moses was a pretty good leader
[1:13:29] but he wasn't the one God wanted
[1:13:32] do we put him out there 40 years to beat
[1:13:35] it out of him
[1:13:37] to where he could come back
[1:13:40] throw down his rod
[1:13:42] turns into a snake he just stands there
[1:13:49] Dennis and jambres comes up throws
[1:13:51] theirs down they turn them into snakes
[1:13:55] Moses oh I believe it I'm going back
[1:13:58] into the wilderness
[1:14:01] not exactly
[1:14:04] brother Randall said he knowed who he
[1:14:05] was he said he just said
[1:14:08] he just stood still
[1:14:10] he didn't know what was going to happen
[1:14:12] he just stood still
[1:14:18] sometimes folks you're going to get to
[1:14:20] you got yourself against the wall and
[1:14:22] you're gonna have to stand still
[1:14:24] you ain't gonna have all the screaming
[1:14:25] and hollering going on you're going to
[1:14:26] stand still and wait
[1:14:28] and just see what he says
[1:14:30] he just stood down and looked about that
[1:14:33] time that snake gobbled him
[1:14:35] two snakes up
[1:14:36] he reaches down picks up his stick was
[1:14:38] listening last night to the prophet he
[1:14:40] said where was them other two sticks
[1:14:49] he said that's in that stick
[1:14:52] the one Moses went down and smoked the
[1:14:54] water with
[1:14:55] the two old snakes are still in there
[1:14:59] had him captivated didn't you but listen
[1:15:04] you say it's my name there
[1:15:11] is my name there
[1:15:14] trying to cut it short
[1:15:21] have you heard God's voice calling you
[1:15:26] um
[1:15:27] right
[1:15:31] now get the point before we start
[1:15:36] if our names are not written in the
[1:15:38] lounge book of life before the
[1:15:40] foundation of the world
[1:15:43] and he can't call our name called it's
[1:15:45] not there
[1:15:48] remember it's not John Jim Charlie
[1:15:51] whatever
[1:15:56] that's our Earthly name that Mom and
[1:15:58] Daddy gave to us
[1:16:04] so is my name there
[1:16:08] if it is I got to find a way to see
[1:16:11] the key
[1:16:13] the key was one thing that I said a
[1:16:16] moment ago
[1:16:19] brother Branham in referencing to John
[1:16:22] and Elijah
[1:16:24] and people seeing their name he said
[1:16:26] when the seal broke
[1:16:31] and according to my Bible in the
[1:16:33] prophet's message the seals were broken
[1:16:35] in the end time now we know they were
[1:16:37] broke by Jesus Christ back under come on
[1:16:39] okay
[1:16:40] but it wasn't made known or revealed
[1:16:44] that would be what would be done in the
[1:16:46] end time
[1:16:48] now let's get just a second go over to
[1:16:50] number 13 brother in a hurry we'll drop
[1:16:52] over the others
[1:16:54] this is taken from the Third Exodus 1963
[1:16:56] 8 30. paragraph 309.
[1:17:00] now I pray for them Lord I pray that you
[1:17:02] will this hour by your Holy Spirit
[1:17:04] circumcise them Hearts take out all the
[1:17:08] things of the world circumcise their
[1:17:10] ears for they can hear plainly
[1:17:15] now notice and I check this to make sure
[1:17:17] look for they can hear plainly thee
[1:17:20] God's voice
[1:17:23] he didn't say they can hear plain of
[1:17:25] God's voice he said they can hear
[1:17:27] plainly the God's voice calling through
[1:17:30] his word and through the lighting of the
[1:17:32] day
[1:17:34] the revelation of the day right
[1:17:37] and Grant Lord that your eyes will be
[1:17:39] open that they may see the glory of God
[1:17:40] in this life's closing hour
[1:17:44] John didn't see his name until the seals
[1:17:47] broke
[1:17:51] as the sealed broke to you
[1:17:54] oh yes brother Dale I know all about the
[1:17:56] seals
[1:18:01] I know
[1:18:04] but according to Daniel 70 weeks brother
[1:18:06] around and said if you don't understand
[1:18:08] Daniel 70 weeks
[1:18:11] you can't understand the seals
[1:18:14] I send you Daniel 70 weeks book if you
[1:18:16] want to read it
[1:18:18] but yet everybody knows all about the
[1:18:20] seals white horse rider and this that
[1:18:22] and the other you know
[1:18:24] they know nothing about Daniel 70 weeks
[1:18:27] they don't need more to talk about it
[1:18:33] I didn't make that statement
[1:18:38] all right
[1:18:41] what about hearing his voice look at 14.
[1:18:44] which is a six seal 63 323 paragraph 280
[1:18:48] 256 excuse me yeah
[1:18:52] God said that down under the seals under
[1:18:54] the seals now there she was we find out
[1:18:57] he does that and he will do it and there
[1:19:00] everyone hated that away
[1:19:01] but the all that's got their names on
[1:19:04] The Book of Life God will call
[1:19:09] they'll hear it
[1:19:11] my sheep hear my voice that's why I read
[1:19:14] in John 10. Jesus said only thing we've
[1:19:17] got to do is make a sheep call
[1:19:20] ghosts don't know about it
[1:19:23] don't know it
[1:19:25] all right I think it's about time for us
[1:19:27] to make some cheap calls
[1:19:29] and you know you get around a bunch of
[1:19:30] sheeps and goats it's hard to tell the
[1:19:32] difference but a real Shepherd can tell
[1:19:35] he knows where there's a goat or a sheep
[1:19:38] Our Lives should prove what we are
[1:19:42] right
[1:19:46] oldest got their names on the book God
[1:19:48] will call they'll hear
[1:19:54] now with the background that I've
[1:19:57] brought
[1:19:58] remember John
[1:20:01] after the opening of the seals to John
[1:20:04] heard his name or knew it was there
[1:20:08] has gone through the opening of the word
[1:20:11] showed you and I the age that we're
[1:20:13] living
[1:20:18] even the world says we're in Lady of Sia
[1:20:20] the world says we're at an end right
[1:20:22] right
[1:20:24] everybody says we're at an end so are we
[1:20:27] just with everybody
[1:20:30] or has it been revealed to us
[1:20:32] what do you mean brother Dale it's not
[1:20:35] calling your name right
[1:20:37] it's the mystery of what's going on
[1:20:39] while you are here or while that name is
[1:20:43] being represented on Earth
[1:20:47] so Martin Luther
[1:20:49] God opened the seal to Martin Luther
[1:20:52] let him preach justification
[1:20:56] because the sealed had already broke by
[1:20:58] Jesus Christ back there two thousand
[1:20:59] years ago
[1:21:01] I don't mean that that it was John that
[1:21:04] Luther went to over and got the sealed
[1:21:07] and preached one two three four five six
[1:21:09] seven and
[1:21:10] understood to God hit now he's still a
[1:21:12] trinitarian
[1:21:20] but the revelation of the hour showed
[1:21:22] him his name in the book
[1:21:24] it was a revelation of this hour shown
[1:21:26] our name in the book
[1:21:29] the words it was written
[1:21:31] for the foundation of the world
[1:21:35] look at the last one
[1:21:37] number 16.
[1:21:40] Christ identified
[1:21:42] the same in all ages if you'll notice
[1:21:44] basically all the quotes today has been
[1:21:46] after 63 in case somebody would want to
[1:21:49] say
[1:21:50] I believe after 63.
[1:21:54] and they've all been out
[1:21:56] so look
[1:21:58] so we're trying to get ever Soul saved
[1:22:00] so that Jesus could come
[1:22:03] and he cannot come until that lice won
[1:22:07] that has the name
[1:22:10] of The Book of Life
[1:22:12] that was put down before the foundation
[1:22:13] world
[1:22:15] when that name is called
[1:22:17] now not just I'm not you the wrong but
[1:22:21] just say Mordecai so you were just born
[1:22:22] this
[1:22:24] I'm talking about salvation
[1:22:27] when we come to Salvation
[1:22:30] we can hear his name when we come to
[1:22:31] Salvation we begin to talk about his
[1:22:33] name when we come in Salvation keep
[1:22:35] growing in we begin to see our name
[1:22:37] written on the book right come on
[1:22:39] when that name is called that's Elias
[1:22:42] one of them
[1:22:43] he came to redeemed to bring back redeem
[1:22:46] is to bring back and when he brings the
[1:22:48] last one in he is sitting at the right
[1:22:50] hand of God to not doing his mutatorial
[1:22:52] work and when that life soul is saved
[1:22:55] that was redeemed
[1:22:58] and seen and knowed by God before the
[1:23:01] foundation of the world but that life
[1:23:03] soul is saved that closes the book then
[1:23:06] the lamb comes
[1:23:08] out takes the book out of the right hand
[1:23:11] of him that sets upon the throne then
[1:23:13] he's coming then he's coming to the
[1:23:15] Earth
[1:23:18] you see what I'm talking about
[1:23:23] that
[1:23:27] it's not Samuel Dale it's not James
[1:23:29] Cawley
[1:23:31] it's not Donnie far bush
[1:23:35] it's the hour that we're living
[1:23:39] then all names of the world is even
[1:23:42] listed in there
[1:23:44] of lady osia
[1:23:46] but not in the lounge book of life
[1:23:48] section
[1:23:50] only the redeemable
[1:23:53] are listed
[1:23:57] when that last name comes forth on Earth
[1:24:01] he's born again
[1:24:03] then the lamb can come
[1:24:07] brother random did the lamb lead The
[1:24:09] Mercy Seat in the 60s he said where's
[1:24:10] your get that out
[1:24:16] well yet that's a big Doctrine
[1:24:20] the lamb left of Mercy Seat in 63.
[1:24:23] then we've been under judgment ever
[1:24:25] since
[1:24:26] and remember under judgment nobody saved
[1:24:34] so where are you at what are we doing
[1:24:39] what is it to find your name in the book
[1:24:41] find the age you're living
[1:24:44] and see if you can believe it
[1:24:49] come on
[1:24:51] do you understand what I'm saying see if
[1:24:53] we can believe this prophet's message
[1:24:55] that's the only way we can find our name
[1:24:57] in the book is to believe the prophet's
[1:24:59] message for the end time because he's
[1:25:00] not another message to come
[1:25:04] to believe this message is finding my
[1:25:06] name
[1:25:10] I preached back there in 1906 79.
[1:25:15] and I said a person that comes to the
[1:25:17] opening of the seals is fully redeemed
[1:25:19] I still believe that today
[1:25:23] but you know I got a lot older since
[1:25:25] then I had a lot of problems that ain't
[1:25:27] got nothing to do with God's word
[1:25:30] when the seals break to you you're
[1:25:32] redeemed
[1:25:33] what do you think it's doing that's
[1:25:34] calling your name do you understand
[1:25:39] to believe this message to say this
[1:25:42] message is true not what's going around
[1:25:44] the garbage cans of the people of the
[1:25:46] messages and you've got to believe this
[1:25:47] you got to believe that you believe that
[1:25:49] that means you you're in if you believe
[1:25:51] my two Soul Doctrine
[1:25:56] those who know their God
[1:26:00] right
[1:26:02] the opening of the word is the calling
[1:26:04] of your name now let me do it right
[1:26:06] tired of this afternoon
[1:26:11] the revealing of the word is the calling
[1:26:13] of your name
[1:26:17] is it true
[1:26:18] that you were a sinner
[1:26:21] of course if you're like the people's
[1:26:23] messages no I never was a sinner I never
[1:26:25] was lost I always was eternal well then
[1:26:27] forget it
[1:26:30] but if you realize he was lost that
[1:26:32] means you was going One Direction
[1:26:35] just headed to hell right
[1:26:39] the new birth turned us around
[1:26:45] see John heard the Master's Call
[1:26:49] many times when he talked with him on
[1:26:52] on the earth in his ministry
[1:26:57] but you know John had enough in him to
[1:26:59] go up to the upper room and stay
[1:27:04] somebody said I think we got it let's
[1:27:06] leave somebody said we don't have what
[1:27:10] he said
[1:27:11] that's the way your Prophet said it
[1:27:16] John was represented there in the book
[1:27:20] in many ways
[1:27:22] but it had to be revealed to him on
[1:27:24] Patmos who he was and what he was doing
[1:27:29] don't you think it was something that
[1:27:31] that Prophet to come into the world
[1:27:32] believing that these was going to happen
[1:27:34] that was going to happen in the end time
[1:27:35] but one day God stopped him and said
[1:27:38] you are the man
[1:27:42] now you go
[1:27:46] because you're the one I called
[1:27:49] Moses fine doing good
[1:27:53] sit out there on the backside of the
[1:27:55] desert and teach her what was his name
[1:27:57] was it would you curse him with his name
[1:27:58] and what his name's son tonight
[1:28:00] I'm leader I'm I'm gonna take children
[1:28:03] out of each
[1:28:05] no I'm I'm going to take them out
[1:28:08] my mama told me
[1:28:11] what daddy when are we going
[1:28:15] but son we got away
[1:28:18] it's not exactly time ain't that our
[1:28:20] good excuse
[1:28:23] we asked God to heal us well maybe it's
[1:28:26] not time yet for him to heal me so I'll
[1:28:28] just do the best I can to like it
[1:28:30] Now where's your confession
[1:28:33] it ain't personal
[1:28:35] anybody in the Bible ever amounted to
[1:28:37] anything had something personal with God
[1:28:41] Joshua was standing out there today he's
[1:28:43] standing there looking he had done been
[1:28:45] commissioned by Moses he had done been
[1:28:47] ordained and done all the things
[1:28:50] that he walks out there one day and he
[1:28:52] looks over and out stands a man with a
[1:28:54] sword
[1:28:55] yeah I better run
[1:28:59] he grabs his sword and he went after him
[1:29:01] he said are you for us are you against
[1:29:04] us
[1:29:05] he said I'm neither one I come to take
[1:29:08] over
[1:29:10] right
[1:29:11] you want your prophet's words of that I
[1:29:13] didn't come to take side I come to take
[1:29:15] over now let's go into the Promised Land
[1:29:19] divided up
[1:29:23] it's about time you and I begin to
[1:29:25] believe Who We Are
[1:29:27] let's stand

[1:29:32] music we'll just sing if anybody has a
[1:29:34] need the order is open

[1:29:46] because
[1:29:49] he first love
[1:30:01] anybody have a need have you ever had a
[1:30:04] personal experience
[1:30:07] if you haven't then you don't know what
[1:30:09] God or what we're talking about
[1:30:24] father our brothers got a sick stomach
[1:30:27] messing him up Lord help me ache
[1:30:31] so we just condemned that the father is
[1:30:34] like a man said one day he said whether
[1:30:36] When you pray you believe he said if you
[1:30:39] didn't pray then after you get through
[1:30:41] it just pray again so we just pray again
[1:30:43] Lord sanctify that to our brother's body
[1:30:47] and take away the sickness that's in
