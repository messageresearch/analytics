[28:59] we love more than anything be able to
[29:01] see him in people man good to be in the
[29:03] house Lord
[29:04] good to be back everything went well we
[29:07] all did great everything was fine Delta
[29:10] decided to keep my luggage for a little
[29:12] while but that's okay one of the when we
[29:17] were preaching on adoption while we were
[29:19] out there and we are telling a son
[29:21] school class we don't nobody trip over
[29:25] there
[29:27] I've never been to a meeting and not
[29:30] saying I had anything to do with it or
[29:32] but I did I was there God used us but
[29:36] I've never seen three preachers that
[29:37] didn't know more than sit down we didn't
[29:39] brother Joel Brown and brother Darrell
[29:42] Ward and myself the three days we
[29:44] preached that's all Richard it's just
[29:47] that and if you would have scripted it
[29:52] you couldn't have scripted it any better
[29:56] then brother Joel Brown starting with
[30:00] just a simple simple sermon and brother
[30:04] Darrell Ward best I'd ever heard him
[30:06] preach on the very same line and we
[30:11] never discussed it one time and then we
[30:13] came in Sunday and and tried to put a
[30:16] put a lid on it put a cap on it so
[30:19] people can understand and they were
[30:20] really we're amazed but you know what
[30:24] we're not amazed at God that's what he
[30:26] does he does that anyway does it all the
[30:29] time I was thinking you know you we
[30:34] limit God to a lot of things Friday
[30:38] before last when we left to go
[30:40] June and I left it like it's almost 7
[30:43] o'clock in the morning our flight was at
[30:44] 11:00 but you know what Atlanta traffic
[30:46] is from 7 o'clock to about 9 o'clock
[30:51] everybody in here is either have been
[30:53] stuck in it or have been a part of it
[30:56] right
[30:57] never hit my brakes one time till we got
[31:02] in the airport right phenomenal at the
[31:07] amount of no traffic zero now Friday
[31:17] this week I was listening on the radio
[31:22] traffic jam downtown rec on 285 rec near
[31:27] the airport traffic bags up hour and a
[31:29] half to two hours I think God before the
[31:33] foundation of the world
[31:35] you told those people not to go where
[31:39] the will they usually go life's Friday
[31:41] but you let them go this Friday you say
[31:45] you God can't we mean God can't do that
[31:47] God orchestrated the whole thing it
[31:50] wasn't it what man cuz I'm telling you
[31:52] it was phenomenal has no traffic between
[31:53] 7:00 we left it seven o'clock driving
[31:57] into Atlanta you know how they're around
[31:59] Jimmy Carter and all starts cramming up
[32:01] and know gone right down to the airport
[32:05] now when we got in the airport the devil
[32:07] was there as soon as we walked in the
[32:10] door the delta ticket line of course
[32:13] we'd already checked him but we had to
[32:14] check in the baggage it was backed up
[32:17] all the way into the carousel but still
[32:20] we still got through everything was
[32:23] great and fine so we think God for that
[32:26] so but but I did I thought man how many
[32:29] times have you been somewhere though and
[32:30] you just ask God to help you and you
[32:33] just zoom right in and then the next few
[32:36] days you look and you go man what a
[32:37] traffic jam that place is down there hmm
[32:42] well see there there was two of us that
[32:45] needed some help so God gave us a double
[32:47] blessing because I'm telling you usually
[32:49] you're hitting your brakes and slowing
[32:51] down but we were right on into the
[32:53] airport and God blessed us like I said
[32:55] we had three good services and the Lord
[32:59] really really showed us some things and
[33:01] they had some real good fellowship so
[33:03] god bless you thank you for thank you

[33:56] till tomorrow to get the newspaper we've
[33:59] already read the newspaper we already
[34:02] know what's going to happen but we want
[34:06] to be made aware of what's fixing to
[34:10] happen because we don't know everything
[34:12] but God's give us a God give us a
[34:15] message and he gave us a prophet and he
[34:18] gave us the Holy Ghost to what lead us
[34:19] and guide us into all truth not some
[34:23] truth he said he would do that into all
[34:26] truth so we thank God for that so let's
[34:28] bow our heads before we get started the
[34:31] Heavenly Father thank you for this day
[34:32] thank you for this great word that we're
[34:34] sitting under Lord that you give us an
[34:37] opportunity to even hear what prophets
[34:40] down through the ages and many many
[34:42] Christian people down through time has
[34:44] wanted to stand in this moment and Lord
[34:46] here we are
[34:47] Lord we stand here at the end of all
[34:50] things the end of time for the Gentile
[34:53] church and we thank you Father that you
[34:56] give a spiritual insight you've give us
[34:58] Lord tomorrow's news we've already read
[35:01] the the paper Lord and we we know that
[35:05] that we win but there's a journey that
[35:08] we have to go through called life and as
[35:12] brother Dale is talking we have to we
[35:13] have to grow up we have to grow up in
[35:14] garden we have to grow up spiritually
[35:18] father I pray that you would help us
[35:20] today to do that father you be the
[35:22] active participant the one do the
[35:23] speaking the one
[35:24] do the hearing and the one doing the
[35:26] revealing father bless the sick ones
[35:29] that are not here the ones Lord that
[35:31] need help we pray this you would bless
[35:34] them lift them up in their spirit father
[35:37] bless each one of us as we stand today
[35:39] father just a bunch of needy people but
[35:43] Lord you said you'd provide all of our
[35:44] needs
[35:45] Lord I pray that you'd be with us and
[35:47] take care of us lead us and guide us by
[35:49] your Holy Spirit in Jesus name we pray
[35:51] amen
[35:54] revelations 8:1 and when he had opened
[35:56] the Seventh Seal There was silence in
[35:58] heaven about the space of a half an hour
[36:02] Ephesians 4:30 says in grieve not the
[36:05] Holy Spirit of God whereby you are
[36:07] sealed unto the day of redemption you
[36:12] may be seated in the Lord add his
[36:13] blessing to the reading of the word now
[36:15] as we get started I want us to this will
[36:18] probably as we were we're talking this
[36:22] week this last weekend there were I told
[36:27] him Sunday morning I said this is one
[36:31] meeting that I'll promise you one thing
[36:32] all three preachers were in their right
[36:34] mind we were all left handed well the
[36:39] Darrell Ward myself I didn't know
[36:41] brother Joel Brown was but when he
[36:42] started writing things down and and
[36:43] being a lefty I know the mannerisms of a
[36:46] left-handed person so I know I knew that
[36:49] he was so I got up Sunday morning I said
[36:51] do you know one thing's for sure we were
[36:53] all in our right mind when we were
[36:55] speaking to you this weekend so I hope
[36:57] we're all still in our right mind anyway
[36:59] man God's not left-brained or
[37:01] right-brained he is the brain but that
[37:04] was kind of funny they were all three
[37:06] all three of us were left-handed
[37:08] preachers so but we look in this book of
[37:10] revelations we're coming to the end of
[37:12] something but like I said before when we
[37:14] come to the end of something with God
[37:16] it's not the end as man thinks the end
[37:20] because man has four years and thousands
[37:24] of years has looked at the end of the
[37:26] world the end of time the end you see
[37:29] all these movies and things about the
[37:33] end time and the end the end you know
[37:35] what that is the end for the
[37:37] but it's just the beginning for a
[37:39] Christian it's just the part that you
[37:42] and I have to realize that we're set
[37:44] here in time to do something but this is
[37:47] really this is just part of what we're
[37:50] doing we're going to something much
[37:52] greater and much more and it's always
[37:56] eternal because this of God a man we're
[37:59] standing here in this in this time
[38:01] element and truly it is a struggle we
[38:03] try to survive we try to do the best
[38:05] with Canada I we were talking about this
[38:08] past weekend you know it's it's hard on
[38:11] people in people that and sometimes we
[38:13] make it hard on yourself
[38:15] amen we make it hard on ourselves you
[38:18] don't do what God wants us to do but you
[38:20] know what if you come back if you like
[38:22] brother Dale was talking about being
[38:23] back slid listen if you can't you're not
[38:27] back slid if you're lost you're lost
[38:30] because the prodigal son was a son he
[38:35] was born a son he just went wayward a
[38:38] little way and then he came back but he
[38:40] was a son and that's the way you and I
[38:42] are we look at these things and we think
[38:43] boy these people are just no give them
[38:45] time God give you time so let's give
[38:49] them time all these people that are on
[38:51] this wall I pray every every time I
[38:54] stand over there and pray there's a wall
[38:56] right here at my Sunday School class
[38:57] full of people that have not come to the
[39:01] Lord you remember we put them all on the
[39:02] wall let's don't forget those those
[39:05] people need salvation so we look at this
[39:08] wall and we see this wall of people that
[39:10] needs to be some of those needs to be
[39:12] struck off because they need to be here
[39:13] and then they need to be brought back to
[39:16] the Lord and you know what they willing
[39:17] in the time because remember God has the
[39:21] most patience of anybody I know because
[39:23] he's already solved that how in the
[39:24] world if we saw the end from the
[39:27] beginning we'd want to hurry up and get
[39:30] to the end because we're gonna be living
[39:32] in a glorious time but we got to see all
[39:34] this other other stuff that's going on
[39:36] and we look when we see the seals I want
[39:39] to kind of one more time I'm not going
[39:41] to draw much as far as the church ages
[39:44] we should already know we're in the last
[39:45] church age we should already know we're
[39:47] in the last message that the Gentile
[39:49] church is going to get
[39:50] oh there's no big message preacher gonna
[39:53] jump up here and be the final voice to
[39:56] the Gentile age we've already had that
[39:58] we have already had now what we're doing
[40:01] is is we're breaking down and and
[40:04] helping helping being servants we're
[40:07] helping everybody kind of get in the
[40:09] right channel so we can get out of here
[40:12] because I believe God does use the
[40:13] fivefold ministry to bring the people to
[40:15] a place so you can see who you are not
[40:17] who I see who you are that you see who
[40:20] you are when the bride realizes who she
[40:22] is and what she's doing here bride
[40:24] realizes who she is not preacher's bride
[40:27] realizes who she is and what they're
[40:29] doing here
[40:29] they'll be an invincible army all right
[40:32] so we're cut where I think we're coming
[40:33] to that place all right I just do I
[40:35] believe we're coming to that place so
[40:38] let's read this just what we've read
[40:39] these quotes before but I saw a little
[40:41] more maybe low on it this weekend this
[40:43] past weekend was it was a wonderful
[40:45] weekend just um you know I'm all over
[40:48] the things that that was that was
[40:49] preached there and like I said I enjoyed
[40:51] them
[40:52] the brothers really did a really good
[40:53] job but we were all speaking pretty much
[40:55] on adoption they didn't call it adoption
[40:58] but you can call it whatever you want to
[40:59] view preaching in the same line you get
[41:01] the people in that same attitude then
[41:04] you see that everybody needs to grow
[41:06] some are going to grow different some
[41:07] are going to grow bigger some are going
[41:09] to grow
[41:09] look at Michael how can you not look at
[41:14] Michael he's 6 foot 800 I remember when
[41:20] he was a little big child mm-hmm I
[41:24] wasn't gonna say baby but he was you
[41:27] were the baby but I look at him now good
[41:29] grief he's what 6 5 6 7 8 9 he's still
[41:33] growing why because he's God Jean in him
[41:37] to grow with his genetic makeup is a
[41:40] little bit different than mine because
[41:42] mine got me at about 511 and that's
[41:44] about it stuck there about going in
[41:46] further same way with garden the only
[41:50] thing is is you and I boy don't do that
[41:52] you and I don't you think I see what's
[41:55] going on back there
[41:56] Boyd's going
[42:04] put his name down take your name but we
[42:12] do all grow in different stages we all
[42:14] have different growth spurts because
[42:15] we're human same way in the gospel and
[42:18] as we were talking downstairs and we
[42:20] were talking this past weekend you can
[42:22] stunt your growth you can do that
[42:25] yourself that is a free moral agent is
[42:27] helped me more than anything you can
[42:29] make yourself available for the word or
[42:31] you cannot okay it's just it's up to you
[42:34] and like brother Dale said this morning
[42:36] being being in being a born-again
[42:39] Christian that puts you in the body and
[42:41] puts you in line for all these things
[42:43] but you can stop it at any moment you
[42:45] can quit eating and when you quit eating
[42:47] what happens you stunt your growth
[42:49] you don't become not a human you become
[42:53] a mountain erst human you become
[42:55] somebody that you look at all these and
[42:57] I hate to see that overseas they see the
[42:59] little children and all their their
[43:01] growth being studied because what they
[43:03] don't get the nutrition all right they
[43:05] don't get the nutrition if they don't
[43:07] get the nutrition they don't get the
[43:10] nutrition then even a young Christian
[43:12] can what just drop and sit there and
[43:15] just not die not die but be so
[43:22] malnourished you don't know what you're
[43:24] missing but oh what about a bunch of
[43:26] vitamins somebody comes from over here
[43:29] and goes over there to a little country
[43:31] in Africa and take some good food and
[43:33] good water and good vitamins why you see
[43:35] the kids just start growing and they're
[43:37] more happy you now would be more happy
[43:39] the more we get closer to God we should
[43:41] be more happy and then so you say you
[43:44] look at these seals and you think well I
[43:46] hope like brother Bob said a couple
[43:49] weeks ago I hope that we tried to make
[43:51] this so simple that it's really so
[43:53] simple some people are waiting for this
[43:55] great big moment the great crescendo you
[43:59] know of the ending of the story or it's
[44:02] already here it's already here you're
[44:06] living it I already said it's Christ in
[44:09] you the hope of glory and I'm the the
[44:12] others really enjoyed cuz I really hung
[44:15] on Sunday after Sunday morning about all
[44:18] these things that we as message
[44:20] believers have thought when when this
[44:27] happens this will happen when California
[44:31] sinks this is happening when when this
[44:35] happens this happened listen all that
[44:38] external stuff president woman in the
[44:41] White House we get all these quotes and
[44:42] we start quoting them we've been wrong
[44:45] we have been 50 years wrong brother Dale
[44:49] said it today it comes from right here
[44:52] no one will lay hands on you to take a
[44:56] body change I know it's going to come
[45:01] from what you got already inside of you
[45:04] a man so it's going to come from within
[45:07] nothing external is going to cause you
[45:11] listen if California leaven I'm a little
[45:15] bit off the subject now may be a little
[45:16] long today so just get with it on 9/11
[45:20] after 9/11 what happened churches filled
[45:24] up right day of prayer when they think
[45:29] don't even for Kenny and praying school
[45:31] day oppression all day of prayer it all
[45:35] become why because of the disaster
[45:38] something happened you and I are not
[45:40] that way Christians do not react to a
[45:43] disaster because you ain't a Christian
[45:47] if you have to wait till something
[45:48] happens hello
[45:52] if you have to wait till something well
[45:54] we're waiting on waiting on what brother
[45:57] Brown said waiting on you and I adoption
[46:01] time I read that quote Sunday God's
[46:03] waiting on you and I adoption time where
[46:06] God can pour into us his fullness and
[46:09] like I've always said before Dwight
[46:11] Moody said God will fill those who are
[46:13] not full of their self amen so that's
[46:16] our problem we've been so full of
[46:17] ourselves we ain't letting God do his
[46:19] work well let God work his way out so
[46:22] let's look at this just for a minute the
[46:25] subject is what is next
[46:26] let's just kind of background a little
[46:29] bit and let's just see let's go to
[46:32] number one we've read it before but this
[46:37] is the whole basis of the seals because
[46:43] he breaks the seals number one he breaks
[46:47] the seals reveals gives us his
[46:50] inheritance to his people now let me ask
[46:53] you a question what is redemption
[46:57] redemption is not replacement right
[47:01] redemption is something has fallen to a
[47:04] position and then God's going to bring
[47:06] it back listen man can't bring it back
[47:08] God will bring it back you know why
[47:11] because I like what brother Darrell Ward
[47:13] didn't he he took a piece of paper and
[47:17] and see that that piece of paper is
[47:19] eternal this is eternal life if you can
[47:22] make it just look just go with me this
[47:25] is the eternal life okay you show it's
[47:29] got a beginning and SEP forget it this
[47:31] is an example okay this is eternal you
[47:36] can't make eternal here or here or here
[47:41] eternal has to stay the way it is right
[47:44] but now what happened in the Garden of
[47:46] Eden and the Garden of Eden to get this
[47:49] plan of redemption because you know what
[47:51] God saw the plan of redemption before
[47:53] the foundation of the world knew how he
[47:57] was going to save every one of us in you
[47:59] who would be saved and who wouldn't but
[48:00] now remember that wasn't that wasn't put
[48:05] into place until it happens on earth God
[48:09] can think about it in his mind but he
[48:11] had to materialize remember we he stood
[48:13] as a lamb slain before the foundation of
[48:15] the world our names were written in the
[48:16] Lamb's Book of Life why didn't we just
[48:18] go right straight into the future home
[48:21] because it had to be a plan of
[48:24] redemption so God had to redeem us back
[48:28] to be the savior the healer the Redeemer
[48:31] but in the Garden of Eden what happened
[48:34] Adam didn't lose eternal life right
[48:38] he lost his fellow
[48:40] chef's eternal still eternal doesn't
[48:47] matter anyway you you take this eternal
[48:49] is eternal now what is redemption it's
[48:51] bringing it back to here not here not
[48:55] here the matching pieces he was
[48:59] preaching matching pieces and ginger
[49:01] leaned over and she said he's preaching
[49:02] matching pieces that your daddy preached
[49:04] in 1995 but what he was talking about
[49:06] because remember Adam didn't lose his
[49:09] eternal life he was the son of God he
[49:13] lost his ability to continue on in
[49:17] eternal life but this man right here
[49:22] what does the inheritance he gave us he
[49:25] gave us an inheritance that we never had
[49:27] and that's eternal life in our body
[49:30] he turtles always eternal and remember
[49:34] one thing's for sure if you're a part of
[49:37] this you got to be a part of this
[49:40] doesn't matter how you pull it apart
[49:43] it's like I said told them Sunday
[49:46] I used this analogy a little bit more I
[49:47] said now look brother Daryl didn't take
[49:49] this and throw this down and say now
[49:52] this is Redemption that's not redemption
[49:58] because Redemption is putting it back
[50:00] together eternal to eternal so now the
[50:06] problem is is we lost our fellowship
[50:10] Eternals always stayed eternal and this
[50:14] is Christ this is this is who every just
[50:17] is Jesus Christ this is Christ this is
[50:19] the this is the Alpha Omega the
[50:22] beginning in the end the Savior the
[50:24] healer the redeemer put it all in this
[50:26] but it goes right back to one word
[50:28] that's eternal we fell from eternal life
[50:31] now there's 6,000 years of a gap amen
[50:38] but when we realize who we are and what
[50:42] we're doing here this is what we're
[50:48] doing
[50:52] we're trying to put this back together
[50:54] this together
[50:55] humanity human I came from God
[51:02] and I'm going back to God when the bride
[51:07] begins to say I and my father are one
[51:10] and these other things the shucker pull
[51:13] away that's what our problem is we've
[51:15] been either like this or like this or
[51:21] totally something different
[51:22] you can't vulcanize you can only
[51:25] vulcanized rubber to rubber that's what
[51:28] our thought is is we weren't well by the
[51:30] way we're not rubber I'm just telling
[51:32] you what God said I'm just telling you
[51:35] what God said when when brother Brown
[51:37] said I and my father 1 and these other
[51:39] things the shucker pull away why are you
[51:41] bringing him back together
[51:43] it took Christ to come Jesus Christ to
[51:46] come though and remember he's the only
[51:48] seal grieve not the Holy Spirit of God
[51:50] where you swear by you are sealed unto
[51:52] the day of redemption there's only one
[51:55] seal to be broken that's that seventh
[51:57] seal which is the whole plan of
[51:59] redemption because like brother Dale
[52:01] says once you get born again your plan
[52:04] of redemption is complete but you still
[52:10] got a growth development to come to if
[52:11] you want to continue on those who he's
[52:14] justified he has already glorified
[52:19] listen at Calvary God put the pieces
[52:21] back together remember brother Brahm
[52:24] said he said your body was redeemed
[52:27] Israel was redeemed at Calvary but it
[52:32] has not been applied yet so we're down
[52:35] here in time trying to apply it back to
[52:39] where we go back to eternal comes
[52:42] remember if your soul is eternal then
[52:44] what part of eternal isn't on this piece
[52:46] of paper it's the paper with no tear
[52:52] it's the paper so what does the seals do
[52:56] the seals didn't bring eternal life back
[52:58] to the people not in their soul not as
[53:01] the new birth the new birth would
[53:04] from acts 2:38 Iraq's two before x2 38
[53:08] Kalu's acts to write eternal life coming
[53:12] back into the soul of man was preached
[53:15] and redemption was in the process all
[53:19] through the six Church ages but they
[53:22] couldn't come to that last little part
[53:23] that you're at now that your spirit can
[53:30] be clean and that your body can be clean
[53:33] your body is what we're listen the only
[53:37] part of you that's eternal is your soul
[53:38] but you know what brother Branham said
[53:41] if Adam had not to fail what would
[53:42] happen his body would have been made
[53:45] eternal it would have been the whole
[53:47] three parts body spirit and soul does
[53:51] that listen because that's what we're
[53:53] going back to right redemption is not
[53:56] replacement redemptions not replacement
[54:00] and redemption is not this it's dry hair
[54:05] he's putting the pieces back together
[54:07] he saw us before the foundation of the
[54:10] world completely totally redeemed the
[54:14] whole plan everybody that was going to
[54:16] be in it
[54:17] he saw a vision we were talking about
[54:20] this morning Bibles in Sunday school he
[54:22] saw a vision now that vision has got to
[54:26] be complete because like I told him
[54:28] downstairs brother Darrell Ward was we
[54:31] were talking about this and and he
[54:33] brought out a quote where brother
[54:35] Branham said he's talking about you know
[54:36] seeing a vision and how how he brother
[54:38] Branham had faith in that vision brother
[54:41] Branham he reached the quote he says
[54:43] lady your name is sister I Isabella del
[54:48] mundo and I see you live at one forty
[54:52] two and a half Street now working with
[54:58] the post office you can't guess that
[55:02] because working for the post office if
[55:04] you only have half numbers it means
[55:06] there's one driveway and like two units
[55:08] of an apartment sitting here one's 142
[55:11] and one's 142 and a half he was
[55:12] literally looking at that woman's
[55:15] address
[55:17] on the door he wasn't guessing that and
[55:21] he said I see you inside your house
[55:23] sitting on a bed groaning with a
[55:26] headache
[55:27] now what's brother branham doing he is
[55:29] seeing I told him this morning you know
[55:31] brother Branham was the greatest
[55:33] scientist that ever lived he had high
[55:36] definition television way before way
[55:39] before man did I don't think he saw that
[55:42] vision in black and white no he said
[55:46] your eyes are blue you got on the green
[55:48] shirt you drive a red car your house is
[55:51] painted red or blue or green he tells
[55:53] him why because God was showing him the
[55:56] vision either that had already happened
[56:00] or that was fixing to have memory told
[56:02] brother build now he said I see me and
[56:04] you shaking hands in front of the
[56:06] tabernacle you will rise up from the bed
[56:08] you see how that is that you say well
[56:11] boy that's wonderful it is great but
[56:14] that was all temporary the real vision
[56:18] is what God had of us that will never go
[56:21] away before the foundation world what
[56:24] we're trying to do now is get you to see
[56:26] that vision that God's already seen up
[56:30] here in his mind and now it's being
[56:32] transformed down here you say brother
[56:35] wait where are you going with this all
[56:36] right let's go to the breach because
[56:39] these seals like I said before you can
[56:46] make a list that will not fit on this
[56:48] page of what people spot the seals worth
[56:55] if you've been in the message long
[56:57] enough you've heard some of them it's
[56:59] been this and that and the other what
[57:01] it's all been external some man hmm some
[57:04] building some doctrine someplace you got
[57:08] to be some they made it everything but
[57:17] what it's supposed to be and that's
[57:20] Christ in you crocks doing the work
[57:23] through you because listen the plan of
[57:24] redemption is not for trees and cars and
[57:27] houses and plants the plan of redemption
[57:30] is for me and you
[57:31] and then everything under that comes up
[57:35] amen
[57:36] because when Adam fell the whole nature
[57:39] fell Romans eight brother Dale has been
[57:40] reading Romans eight the whole world is
[57:42] waiting for the manifestation of the
[57:43] sons of God why because that son of God
[57:45] let him down in the beginning amen
[57:49] Adam had to start fending for himself
[57:52] amen
[57:53] but here you and I are coming every
[57:57] mystery of the Bible each one of these
[57:58] seals the whole thing together the whole
[57:59] mystery lays writing these seals every
[58:04] mystery of the Bible lays in these seals
[58:05] and the seals cannot be broken until
[58:08] that time now remember it's a book of
[58:10] redemption keep going all the way down
[58:14] to the bottom from Genesis to Revelation
[58:15] so now we've started where it broke from
[58:20] the break came in Genesis the real the
[58:23] actuality is when Adam sold the human
[58:27] race and it split us apart and then but
[58:33] now in Revelations we see it come back
[58:37] together
[58:37] Amen well we'll get a little thought on
[58:41] that in just a minute from Genesis to
[58:44] revelations a complete plan of
[58:46] redemption is revealed in these seven
[58:50] seals oh it's an important time God help
[58:51] us to get it now remember in the opening
[58:55] of the seals it's even going through the
[58:57] seals it shows your redemption to my
[58:59] Redemption but it always also shows the
[59:02] redemption of Israel the fifth seals you
[59:07] the sixth seal sanctification of the
[59:10] earth and that's going into the
[59:12] Millennium amen and then the seventh
[59:15] seal is we always got one quote it's
[59:17] revealing Christ all right so now let's
[59:21] go to the next go to the next quote
[59:23] let's get to a place right here just
[59:26] hold that thought just for a second so
[59:28] now what is redemption redemption is not
[59:30] replacement right redemption is not
[59:33] replacement a complete plan of
[59:35] redemption is revealed in the seventh
[59:38] seal so everything we need to change our
[59:41] body is in those opening of the seven
[59:44] seals
[59:45] but now it's the process like I said
[59:48] before it would be real easy for us to
[59:51] just say I'm born again boom I'm changed
[59:54] oh mile that would be simple but you
[59:57] know what it wouldn't be a journey it
[1:00:00] wouldn't be it wouldn't be a plan of
[1:00:02] redemption it wouldn't be a plan
[1:00:04] hey brother Brown said in constant
[1:00:06] mystery God revealed that Christ God had
[1:00:08] a what a plan and a purpose and he was
[1:00:12] going to CC you and I can make a plan
[1:00:14] and a purpose and sometimes they don't
[1:00:16] come together but I'll promise you God's
[1:00:18] thoughts are eternal whatever pops in
[1:00:20] his brain it will happen
[1:00:22] amen and nothing will pop into his brain
[1:00:25] that's not going to come to pass and
[1:00:27] then because he's got he knows all
[1:00:30] things what a great God we serve but
[1:00:32] it's not replacement so now what
[1:00:35] happened when God comes to a place where
[1:00:38] he comes down to earth and Jesus
[1:00:42] therefore received the vinegar and said
[1:00:43] it is finished he bowed his head and
[1:00:45] gave up the ghost he preached
[1:00:47] three-and-a-half years the whole plan of
[1:00:52] redemption is preached in those three
[1:00:54] and a half years that he was on the
[1:00:57] earth amen
[1:00:59] now we see all the other things of the
[1:01:01] Old Testament Saints and the different
[1:01:02] ones but geez it's all connected to that
[1:01:05] one man Jesus Christ it's all connected
[1:01:08] to him his if he didn't come you can
[1:01:11] forget the rest of it you can forget any
[1:01:14] of it because he was a lamb slain before
[1:01:17] the foundation of the world all right so
[1:01:21] now when Jesus came he bowed his head
[1:01:24] and gave up the ghost I told you we'd
[1:01:27] get to it finally but what happened
[1:01:30] there was silence he really didn't
[1:01:35] preach any more he even told Pilate he
[1:01:40] said anything say in other words Pilate
[1:01:43] kept saying are you the Christ and he
[1:01:45] said you say are you this he's did you
[1:01:47] say he never preached him another long
[1:01:49] sermon now when he came back after he
[1:01:52] took a death bearing resurrection he
[1:01:54] came back and all he done was just told
[1:01:56] him where to go
[1:01:57] and what would happen go into all the
[1:02:01] world preach the gospel baptizing in the
[1:02:04] name of the Father Son Holy Ghost that's
[1:02:06] what he told him then he was it was gone
[1:02:08] he didn't do it that wasn't a lot of
[1:02:09] preaching left amen
[1:02:11] so we look and see that we think that we
[1:02:14] say well the devil
[1:02:15] well world world says the devil silenced
[1:02:19] him but no he had just started his work
[1:02:21] because his real work was not him
[1:02:24] himself being on earth he came here for
[1:02:28] you he came here to release that life
[1:02:34] called Christ read it right here next
[1:02:39] quote number three
[1:02:41] hmm surviving in the Sun he is the one
[1:02:44] who opened those seals so remember he
[1:02:46] opened the seals he is those seals for
[1:02:51] the whole Word of God is Christ and
[1:02:53] Christ is the seals that was open what
[1:02:58] is the opening of seals then revealing
[1:03:01] Christ and as I said before where is
[1:03:04] Christ he's in you we don't have Jesus
[1:03:08] Christ walking around on earth today the
[1:03:10] people can point and say there's Christ
[1:03:13] he disappeared 2,000 years ago he said
[1:03:17] the world will see me no more but you'll
[1:03:21] see me
[1:03:22] cuz I'll be with you and in you to the
[1:03:27] end the age or the end of the world amen
[1:03:30] so see that's to me like brother nails
[1:03:33] always said Jesus preached six seals so
[1:03:35] this so the seals have been open have
[1:03:38] been preached except for number seven
[1:03:41] number seven though is when you get a
[1:03:43] revelation of who Jesus Christ is and
[1:03:45] where he is and where he is
[1:03:50] there's your seventh seal that's the one
[1:03:52] seal grieve not the Holy Spirit of God
[1:03:54] whereby you are sealed until the day of
[1:03:57] your Redemption because remember we're
[1:03:59] going to read this scripture in a minute
[1:04:01] in Matthew where he says about Christ
[1:04:04] being over here and being over here we
[1:04:06] read it before we're gonna read it again
[1:04:07] but let's see what we have
[1:04:10] feeling Christ all right let's go to the
[1:04:14] next one the Greek lexicon tells us that
[1:04:16] Christ means anointed was the Messiah
[1:04:19] the Son of God now we know for a fact he
[1:04:22] was the son of man the Son of God lived
[1:04:25] in him but were they weird the ones that
[1:04:27] got the revelation okay mm-hmm to anoint
[1:04:32] consecrating Jesus to the Masonic office
[1:04:35] and furnishing him with the necessary
[1:04:37] powers for US administration now listen
[1:04:40] Romans 8 tells us we're heirs and joint
[1:04:43] heirs with Christ I want some class
[1:04:47] participation y'all can sleep tonight
[1:04:51] good grief people come on try just try
[1:04:55] to stay awake pinch yourself let some
[1:05:01] hounds pinch you that'll really make you
[1:05:02] mad maybe keep you up though Christ
[1:05:06] means annoying wasn't Messala some God
[1:05:08] now we know he was a son of man couldn't
[1:05:10] go all the way up so if Jesus was given
[1:05:14] brother Brahim told us we were little
[1:05:16] Messiah see we had a we had a man come
[1:05:19] that I was telling him Sunday I got a
[1:05:24] new pair of binoculars my old pair was 8
[1:05:29] by 30 which means 8 magnification with a
[1:05:33] 30 millimeter lens which is the lens
[1:05:35] about that big you're limited to that
[1:05:38] but you can see man's had a binocular
[1:05:43] the whole time and see remember with
[1:05:46] binoculars you see one you look through
[1:05:48] two and you see one so I got some the
[1:05:53] other day I upgraded my revelation I got
[1:05:55] some 10 by 40 twos that means that's
[1:05:58] magnified ten times with the 42
[1:06:01] millimeter lens which brings more light
[1:06:04] in and I can see ten times what I could
[1:06:06] usually just see eight times you and I
[1:06:08] have got this unlimited sight now I'm
[1:06:12] telling you yeah but you know what
[1:06:14] though is best of a binocular you can
[1:06:16] buy oh you people know this look through
[1:06:21] binoculars doesn't matter how good you
[1:06:23] can pay two thousand dollars for
[1:06:24] for a pair of binoculars if you move it
[1:06:26] just one little click right brother
[1:06:28] Danny you can see images but you don't
[1:06:32] see clarity my brother branham coming
[1:06:36] and giving us clarity didn't change the
[1:06:38] Word of God he gave us clarity of what's
[1:06:42] already been told us he turned out
[1:06:46] binocular just enough to where we can
[1:06:48] see now in the high definition we're in
[1:06:50] the denominational world and the
[1:06:52] different people even Luther Wesley even
[1:06:54] Paul says I look through a glass now
[1:06:58] what's the binocular made out of glass I
[1:07:01] see through a glass darkly why he was a
[1:07:04] prophet he could see things but he
[1:07:06] couldn't see the clarity now we got
[1:07:08] brother Branham walks up he tells a lady
[1:07:11] he said I see you in your home
[1:07:13] it's 142 and a half so so Street you got
[1:07:18] on a red dress you're sitting on the bed
[1:07:21] what that was clarity that was the mind
[1:07:25] of God and what happens to you and I
[1:07:27] when the mind of God comes to a group of
[1:07:29] people it gives them clarity of what
[1:07:33] your what's been many many listened many
[1:07:36] people are going to be saved many people
[1:07:38] are going to be born again but they're
[1:07:42] not gonna have the clarity that you and
[1:07:43] I have the clarity that you and I have
[1:07:47] is we can read that map and then the
[1:07:50] letters and are not blurred and the you
[1:07:52] know if you if you look at a map with no
[1:07:54] glasses on if you need glasses what does
[1:07:56] it look like looks like a spiderweb and
[1:08:00] you might get off on three different
[1:08:02] roads before you get on the right one
[1:08:04] but if you put on glasses you get
[1:08:07] clarity and you can see what roads
[1:08:09] you're going on that's what's the same
[1:08:10] way with you and I we are so blessed
[1:08:13] that we have clarity because as Jesus
[1:08:17] stepping into his Masonic office you and
[1:08:20] I have stepped into a messiah office
[1:08:22] we're little messiahs
[1:08:24] so what he gets we get romans 8 let me
[1:08:31] read it again
[1:08:31] we're heirs and joint heirs with Jesus
[1:08:34] Christ
[1:08:35] so whatever Christ got he would
[1:08:37] furnished with the necessary powers for
[1:08:40] its administration see wouldn't have
[1:08:43] been anything if Jesus would have just
[1:08:45] come like like brother Ram said he had
[1:08:47] to go to that grave and come out he
[1:08:51] proved who he was by coming out of that
[1:08:54] grave all during the three and a half
[1:08:56] years listen the religious world called
[1:08:59] him a devil the whole three and a half
[1:09:01] years they called him a demon but he was
[1:09:06] what furnish with the necessary powers
[1:09:09] you and I have been furnished with the
[1:09:11] necessary powers brother Dale's going to
[1:09:13] get into them because you know what that
[1:09:16] little button that little button without
[1:09:21] character now listen the buttons not
[1:09:28] satanic it's the way you use it all
[1:09:33] right but but power with character right
[1:09:36] it's fit to rule Jesus Christ had power
[1:09:40] and character you and I are going up
[1:09:44] that statue of a perfect man to get
[1:09:46] character not to get the Holy Ghost now
[1:09:50] it's to use what you already got because
[1:09:54] remember we're trying to get these
[1:09:55] pieces back together in doing Christians
[1:10:00] with the gifts of the Holy Spirit that's
[1:10:05] what Christ is that's what Christ came
[1:10:07] to do and then you say well then then
[1:10:09] that means that Christ wasn't revealed
[1:10:11] until the end time no it's not true
[1:10:14] remember they were looking at something
[1:10:18] Jesus said believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:10:20] Christ and thou shalt be saved
[1:10:22] amen okay if that's all that's all that
[1:10:25] was there that was their little box that
[1:10:27] they had to work in remember I read that
[1:10:29] quote several Sundays ago God give every
[1:10:32] church age a box and you work in the box
[1:10:36] you're given when I listen what is our
[1:10:39] box our box is adoption and body change
[1:10:42] our box is not to be a good Christian
[1:10:50] you should do that already if you never
[1:10:53] listen these people never heard of the
[1:10:55] Prophet they'd had to wholly go hey man
[1:11:00] and live good cream clean Christian
[1:11:04] lives and went to church what a strange
[1:11:10] thing the bride does now we go when we
[1:11:11] want to take it back to the Bible folk
[1:11:19] alright let's read this right here
[1:11:23] Colossians 1 verse 26 is even the
[1:11:25] mystery which has been hidden from ages
[1:11:28] from generations now this is the Bible
[1:11:30] it's been hidden from ages and
[1:11:32] generations now this is Paul talking to
[1:11:35] the first church age maybe not even
[1:11:37] knowing because remember Paul was
[1:11:39] already dead
[1:11:41] right before John went to Padma so I
[1:11:43] don't know whether he knew of a
[1:11:45] Ephesians Smyrna Pergamum Thyatira
[1:11:48] Church ages I don't know that he did God
[1:11:51] may have revealed it to him but he never
[1:11:53] put it in the Bible John put it in the
[1:11:55] Bible when he went to the book when he
[1:11:56] went to revelations when he went to the
[1:11:58] Isle of Patmos but now watch what Paul's
[1:12:00] telling us even the mystery which has
[1:12:02] been hidden from ages and from
[1:12:04] generations but now it's made manifest
[1:12:06] to his Saints who is that that's us to
[1:12:11] whom god would make known what is the
[1:12:13] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:12:15] among the Gentiles now listen I don't
[1:12:18] don't get me wrong I am NOT a find out
[1:12:22] what Israel is doing person cuz that's
[1:12:25] not to me
[1:12:26] find out what Obama's doing or find out
[1:12:29] what Clinton's I don't care
[1:12:30] I say Clinton sorry I meant Trump I'm
[1:12:35] telling you y'all are looking at
[1:12:36] external your listen I know what you're
[1:12:39] doing
[1:12:40] we're human beings you're warning
[1:12:41] something to happen so you can say AHA
[1:12:45] told you it won't happen because God's
[1:12:50] not going to let you do that but what is
[1:12:53] the mystery which is Christ in you the
[1:12:58] hope of glory
[1:13:00] listen as this book of redemption or
[1:13:05] plan of redemption hinged on Jesus
[1:13:06] Christ it hinges on you to finish it you
[1:13:12] said what about Israel Israel can do
[1:13:15] zero zero until we leave zero not sure
[1:13:22] they can do things can plan up to it but
[1:13:24] they do zero they get no promise in this
[1:13:27] Gentile bride leaving the earth you may
[1:13:33] have individuals but I'm talking about
[1:13:34] the country of Israel Amen my brother
[1:13:38] Brown tells us to watch Russia he
[1:13:42] doesn't say anything about watching
[1:13:43] Israel he's just watching Russia okay I
[1:13:47] have my thoughts on that but that's okay
[1:13:50] but you know what they're just thoughts
[1:13:52] it has nothing to do with me whatever
[1:13:54] Russia does let me tell you something
[1:13:56] let me finish my thoughts from a few
[1:13:57] minutes ago you and I it's gonna happen
[1:14:01] to us first whatever little piece of of
[1:14:05] eternal that we click on
[1:14:08] then that's what something's gonna
[1:14:10] happen outside what we're doing is we
[1:14:11] got it totally reversed we think we can
[1:14:14] find something on the internet or some
[1:14:15] good book or some something that'll tell
[1:14:17] us we're bride right here this is the
[1:14:23] only place you're gonna find out whether
[1:14:25] your bride or not it's right here we
[1:14:30] already know what is what's gonna do we
[1:14:32] have another tooth who's gonna who's
[1:14:34] gonna preach to them we know that so why
[1:14:40] worry about it you better worry about
[1:14:46] getting Christ in you whom we preach
[1:14:51] warning every man and teaching every man
[1:14:56] in all wisdom that we may present every
[1:15:01] man perfect in Christ Jesus that we may
[1:15:04] present every man perfect in Christ
[1:15:07] Jesus what's Paul telling you you got a
[1:15:09] listen to preaching
[1:15:13] teaching every man and all wisdom that
[1:15:16] we may present every man perfect in
[1:15:18] Christ Jesus alright let's go to the
[1:15:22] nation this is Matthew 24 and except
[1:15:26] those days should be shortened there
[1:15:27] should be no flesh should no flesh
[1:15:29] should be saved for the elects sake who
[1:15:32] is the elect where do you live for the
[1:15:35] elect that you but for the elects sake
[1:15:39] those days shall be shortened you said
[1:15:42] well we've been here a long time
[1:15:44] gotcha fixing to do a short work folks
[1:15:47] we either gonna be in or out we're gonna
[1:15:49] get left or we're goin one thing right
[1:15:52] then if any man shall say unto you now
[1:15:56] watch when you say if any man shall say
[1:16:01] unto you now somebody is going to talk
[1:16:04] to you some preacher is going to tell
[1:16:10] you lo here is Christ are there now see
[1:16:15] there you can go for you this well now
[1:16:16] Christ is going to Israel crisis crisis
[1:16:19] this crisis crisis in the seventh under
[1:16:21] virtue of message crisis in the two
[1:16:23] souls or the or the polygamy or in the
[1:16:25] what all that external stuff what the
[1:16:29] Bible say believe it not for there shall
[1:16:37] arise false Christ's and false prophets
[1:16:41] and shall show great signs and wonders
[1:16:46] and so much that if it were possible
[1:16:49] they shall deceive the very legs in
[1:16:51] other words even John when John was on
[1:16:54] Patmos when the Roman cattle are when
[1:16:56] the mother hor comes up in front of John
[1:16:58] the Bible says he admired it he admired
[1:17:02] it and the angel had to turn him away
[1:17:05] and say that thing's full of devils it
[1:17:08] almost caught John looking at it because
[1:17:10] it was so beautiful behold I have told
[1:17:13] you before wherefore if they they shall
[1:17:16] say unto you so it's not just one person
[1:17:19] they shall say unto you behold he's in
[1:17:22] the desert I was just out there there's
[1:17:25] nothing
[1:17:26] it's hot he's in the desert go not forth
[1:17:32] behold his in the secret chamber now
[1:17:35] that sounds good
[1:17:36] behold he's in the secret chamber
[1:17:40] believe it not far as the Lightning
[1:17:44] cometh out of the east and shines even
[1:17:45] to the west so shall also the coming of
[1:17:48] the Son of man be
[1:17:51] now listen no one knew where the son of
[1:17:55] man went they didn't know who he was
[1:17:57] when he was here and they don't know
[1:18:01] where he went and down through 7 Church
[1:18:04] ages most have not known where he went
[1:18:06] now sure we it is Christ in you the hope
[1:18:09] of glory always down through the 6th 7th
[1:18:11] 6th church ages and into this church age
[1:18:12] right they didn't get they didn't get a
[1:18:15] different Christ they got the baptism of
[1:18:17] the Holy Ghost they got the new birth
[1:18:19] for their box but their box had no
[1:18:22] requirement of adoption their box had no
[1:18:25] requirement of taking a bride and making
[1:18:28] a wife out of her they had no promise of
[1:18:32] a body change but our box does that
[1:18:38] don't make us no better but they without
[1:18:40] us are not gonna be made perfect amen so
[1:18:45] as the Lightning cometh out of the east
[1:18:47] and shyness even to the west I like that
[1:18:49] because it came from where he was that
[1:18:51] over there this is the western country
[1:18:54] right so shall also the coming in the
[1:18:57] Son of man be so now where is the son of
[1:19:00] man right here I am I'm part of that box
[1:19:11] Matthew 17 verse 5 we read this many
[1:19:14] times we're gonna read it again while he
[1:19:16] yet spake behold a bright cloud
[1:19:17] overshadowed them now what is this
[1:19:19] brother branham uses this on what here
[1:19:21] you him this is the adoption part of
[1:19:24] your journey thereby okay with that this
[1:19:30] is my beloved son in whom I'm well
[1:19:32] pleased here you him and when the
[1:19:35] disciples heard it they fell in their
[1:19:36] face and were sore afraid and Jesus came
[1:19:38] and touched him and said arise and being
[1:19:40] unafraid and when they lifted up their
[1:19:41] eyes they saw no man save Jesus only as
[1:19:44] they came down from the mountain Jesus
[1:19:46] charged them says tell the vision to no
[1:19:51] man until the Son of Man be risen again
[1:19:54] from the dead and as the samples asked
[1:19:57] him saying why then say the scribes that
[1:20:00] Elias verse first come now see this
[1:20:02] disciples had read Malakoff for his
[1:20:10] disciples had read Malachi for cuz it's
[1:20:12] in the Old Testament Malachi 4 says the
[1:20:16] behold I'll send you Elijah the Prophet
[1:20:18] before the great and dreadful day of the
[1:20:19] Lord so they thought that alas and still
[1:20:26] now in Israel I preached only a long
[1:20:28] time ago they're looking for Elijah they
[1:20:31] know Elijah has to come on the scene
[1:20:33] before Christ and come to the Jews
[1:20:36] alright let's see they got some old news
[1:20:41] we got an updated part of the news
[1:20:44] because this Elijah they're looking for
[1:20:47] this one is our Elijah and it's the
[1:20:53] sample asked him saying why didn't say
[1:20:55] the scribes that Elias much first coming
[1:20:58] jesus answered instead on him he lies
[1:20:59] truly shall first come and restore all
[1:21:02] things now remember he goes on down and
[1:21:06] they think he's talking about John the
[1:21:09] Baptist but now remember John the
[1:21:11] Baptist did not restore all things so
[1:21:17] that's not the Elijah he's talking about
[1:21:18] so this Elijah must first come and
[1:21:21] restore all things under the Son of man
[1:21:26] ministry the Son of Man brother Branham
[1:21:29] stood one day and he said I indict this
[1:21:31] generation for the second crucifixion of
[1:21:35] Jesus Christ why they put him back in a
[1:21:37] tomb they can't get him out for cross oh
[1:21:40] yeah sure Christ died 2,000 years ago to
[1:21:43] save me well where is he now he's in
[1:21:46] heaven they just don't realize he's
[1:21:50] right there in them if they're born
[1:21:52] again that's why I said you see
[1:21:54] the Bible says that nobody knows when
[1:21:56] the Son of Man win just like the
[1:21:57] Lightning going across the sky over but
[1:21:59] you and I do know where he is they maybe
[1:22:04] have looked for him for centuries and
[1:22:06] hundreds of years but we have found him
[1:22:09] amen
[1:22:12] that ought to make you happy it's like
[1:22:14] brother Darrell Ward said I will make a
[1:22:16] Baptist shout television - no man until
[1:22:24] the Son of Man be risen from the dead
[1:22:26] see there's nothing wrong with the
[1:22:28] television if you tell the right vision
[1:22:33] tell the vision television listen that's
[1:22:40] what listen
[1:22:41] that's what brother Branham saw man got
[1:22:43] sure man caught on to what God's already
[1:22:47] been doing brother Branham said God what
[1:22:49] man has broke into God's laboratory what
[1:22:52] to create a television but now remember
[1:22:54] a television brother I'm explains in a
[1:22:56] television only does not produce a
[1:22:59] picture it only shows the picture that's
[1:23:02] already been developed how that God saw
[1:23:06] you before the foundation of the world
[1:23:10] innovation that's got to come to pass
[1:23:13] there was just one little commercial in
[1:23:15] there called sin amen as well a little
[1:23:22] commercial one little interruption
[1:23:24] called sin and you know what God can't
[1:23:27] stand sin so he had to what but he
[1:23:30] didn't do away with the vision it was
[1:23:33] already recorded you know we have these
[1:23:36] things now that that that you can record
[1:23:38] things you know what it had to be
[1:23:42] produced somewhere it only captures
[1:23:45] what's already been done when brother
[1:23:48] Branham saw that he would look at those
[1:23:50] people if he saw that that tape or that
[1:23:54] one that they did what is it the not
[1:23:57] 20th century prophet but the one when he
[1:23:59] was in Chicago you could see me you
[1:24:01] watch him he turns his head what he's
[1:24:04] he's watching the television
[1:24:07] yeah brother Graham told us to get rid
[1:24:09] of our but you know what he told us to
[1:24:12] get rid of the wrong one if you would
[1:24:14] have been in the right vision you'd have
[1:24:16] been okay but that's what he done he was
[1:24:17] looking at that person and he just looks
[1:24:20] off to the corner what there's a portal
[1:24:23] opens up right here he said how do you
[1:24:26] know that well what's he looking at
[1:24:29] he said I see you he's lying if he
[1:24:33] wasn't sin nice sees this person here
[1:24:36] but there's a television screen pops up
[1:24:38] right here in high-definition and says I
[1:24:42] see you as a young woman and you have a
[1:24:46] car wrecked you're throwing up in the
[1:24:48] air memory tells it when we said you're
[1:24:49] throwing up in here he's watching it
[1:24:51] he's watching it on a television and
[1:24:58] it's something that's already happened
[1:25:00] because it can't fabricate if it
[1:25:02] fabricates something is wrong and it
[1:25:05] could be wrong but it's not fabricated
[1:25:07] but lay it's already been put in what
[1:25:09] the mind of God
[1:25:10] you're already put in the mind of God
[1:25:13] you're a part of the mind of God tell
[1:25:22] the vision to no one until he tells him
[1:25:27] don't tell nobody why you know what
[1:25:29] Jesus is telling them you're not gonna
[1:25:31] understand this until the Son of Man
[1:25:35] comes back again and when did he come
[1:25:41] back in our day the son of man message
[1:25:45] just like it was when that man standing
[1:25:47] there the same message is here today in
[1:25:51] its clarity not in a father son Holy
[1:25:54] Ghost baptism not in the Trinitarian
[1:25:57] doctrine no clarity because when Jesus
[1:26:00] was standing here on earth there wasn't
[1:26:03] a Trinity he was it and the early
[1:26:09] disciples knew he was it remember it
[1:26:14] would talk to the 3rd church age before
[1:26:16] Nasia said no it's three of them
[1:26:20] because brother branham was here to
[1:26:22] restore the faith of the father's hail
[1:26:26] ice truly shall first come and restore
[1:26:29] all things now what do you do he
[1:26:32] restored us back to the faith of the
[1:26:34] fathers all right there buddy okay with
[1:26:36] that so what did he do
[1:26:43] let's read this right here
[1:26:45] number four trying to do God a service
[1:26:50] without being his will now God has a
[1:26:52] provided an original way to do things
[1:26:57] and he'll never do it
[1:26:59] contrary to that the box right now he
[1:27:06] promised in the last days what he would
[1:27:08] do and it sent them us the message and
[1:27:13] this message would have the same
[1:27:15] identification as Elijah had as he lost
[1:27:19] your head as John the Baptist's head and
[1:27:22] it would turn the hearts of the people
[1:27:23] not to the denomination but back to the
[1:27:26] original Apostolic Faith back to the
[1:27:30] word how these things have been uh
[1:27:33] vindicated so remember when we look over
[1:27:36] here in the first church aid we know one
[1:27:38] thing's for sure that was the faith of
[1:27:40] the father's that was the original
[1:27:41] message that was there wasn't a
[1:27:43] denomination there wasn't a to soul that
[1:27:46] wasn't then got the doctrine all messed
[1:27:48] up yet they were starting because
[1:27:52] remember Grievous wolves comes in and
[1:27:54] even in the first church age that white
[1:27:56] horse rider rode in that first church
[1:27:57] days but he wasn't predominant it was
[1:28:01] just a little saying then it made its
[1:28:03] way on up but Elijah was to turn us back
[1:28:09] to that and call out a bride for his age
[1:28:15] right
[1:28:20] for this age right here I'm gonna put
[1:28:22] our age but now remember brother branham
[1:28:30] just wasn't sent to us to take out a
[1:28:33] bride for him you understand what I'm
[1:28:40] saying
[1:28:40] daddy Seymour had a message that brought
[1:28:44] out a bride amen the one-eyed black man
[1:28:48] all they had a message that brought out
[1:28:50] a bride if yet they got the baptism of
[1:28:53] the Holy Ghost their bride that's why
[1:28:56] you gonna understand me one day when I
[1:28:57] tell you I'm not degrading brother
[1:28:59] branham but there's gonna be billions I
[1:29:02] say millions of brides that never heard
[1:29:05] of William Branham bride rod but not a
[1:29:12] fully mature bride that's never heard of
[1:29:15] William am Branham he came to do two
[1:29:19] things how many times has this been
[1:29:21] preached he came to what turn us back to
[1:29:25] the original faith of the fathers get
[1:29:28] rid of all the denominations not to the
[1:29:34] denomination but back to the original
[1:29:37] Apostolic fathers back to the word how
[1:29:41] these things have been if indicated now
[1:29:43] this is in 1965 all right howling in the
[1:29:51] sounding of the last angel revelations
[1:29:53] 10 days the seven things of these
[1:29:54] mysteries that's all been why did the
[1:29:56] method let's do this and the Baptist and
[1:29:58] the Church of Christ in Jehovah Witness
[1:29:59] now watch now he's going to take it up a
[1:30:04] notch told you come to do two things he
[1:30:10] come to turn the hearts of the father's
[1:30:11] back I mean two children back to the
[1:30:13] father's back to the original Oh didn't
[1:30:18] know no eternal hell
[1:30:19] water baptism everything was what turned
[1:30:23] back but now remember that doesn't
[1:30:25] change your body it didn't change theirs
[1:30:31] it did not it did not change their body
[1:30:35] them mysteries will be revealed in the
[1:30:39] last day when the seventh angel seventh
[1:30:43] angels message when he not when he
[1:30:45] starts out doing this now I want to
[1:30:50] clear something up real quick I know
[1:30:52] most of you believe it and then so do I
[1:30:53] there's a lot of people in this message
[1:30:55] believes that from 1947 to 1963 you're
[1:31:00] not supposed to listen to that because
[1:31:01] he made so many mistakes and he was all
[1:31:03] this and all that heard it before right
[1:31:07] Aaron heard it before but now from 63 to
[1:31:11] 65 he was true and and you know like
[1:31:13] brother Dale said the son of man came
[1:31:15] and straighten brother Branham out no it
[1:31:17] was a progression of his message it was
[1:31:22] a progression of his ministry all right
[1:31:24] because he did two things turn the
[1:31:26] hearts of the children babies babbling
[1:31:29] baby Pentecostal babies to the faith of
[1:31:32] the fathers and then and then come to do
[1:31:37] something else and then see when he
[1:31:42] begin not when he starts out doing this
[1:31:44] now when he started doing this he was
[1:31:47] bringing out what Methodist Baptist
[1:31:50] Presbyterian Pentecostal and listen to
[1:31:53] be real honest with you they might have
[1:31:55] all not went to a message church because
[1:31:57] there wasn't any at that time they
[1:32:00] probably went back to their Methodists
[1:32:02] and their Pentecost in there but that
[1:32:07] first part of his message was to bring
[1:32:08] them out and get them born again and
[1:32:11] then bring a bride out during that
[1:32:14] Pentecostal age coming through hello hey
[1:32:19] we got grief I'm telling you that's why
[1:32:29] a lot of us you can say what you want to
[1:32:32] I like preaching somewhere else because
[1:32:34] they will be attentive and listen and
[1:32:37] amen and sometimes she'll you know why
[1:32:39] because it's not old news I mean it's
[1:32:42] old news to some of you
[1:32:44] it's not old news to them right don't
[1:32:48] even sit there like a bump on a pickle
[1:32:50] who said that Aaron did Wednesday night
[1:32:53] you sit there like a bump on a pickle
[1:32:55] take a pickle out and look at it
[1:32:57] sometime
[1:32:57] let's get the box it's horrible I feel
[1:33:09] like I told him out in Arizona I see you
[1:33:11] y'all watch y'all watch the 10
[1:33:13] commandments for three hours and never
[1:33:14] get up and go to the bathroom three
[1:33:16] hours I watched the Ten Commandments
[1:33:18] other night boy it was so good
[1:33:22] where's Rebecca brother Gary Atkins
[1:33:24] bless his heart I miss the guy we all
[1:33:27] miss him but we're gonna see he'd sit
[1:33:30] there and he had watched that thing so
[1:33:32] many times he said I'll go very one day
[1:33:34] and he was watching it and he was saying
[1:33:37] it before they said it he was saying the
[1:33:38] lines of the whole movie have any of you
[1:33:45] ever decided to do the scripture that
[1:33:47] way but we can sit there for three hours
[1:33:53] and watch a movie and never go to sleep
[1:33:55] you know why cause it excites you if
[1:33:59] this don't excite you we got some
[1:34:03] growing up to do folks we think we got
[1:34:05] it all we think we don't have to hear we
[1:34:07] think we're just well it's just brother
[1:34:08] Wade and brother Dale they say the same
[1:34:10] thing over and over again you gonna get
[1:34:11] left here you gonna get left here when
[1:34:17] he starts that doing this but when he
[1:34:20] begins to sound this not when he starts
[1:34:22] out doing this but when he begins to
[1:34:25] sound his message see not the years in
[1:34:28] preparation from 47 to 63 he was
[1:34:31] preparing he was turning the heart of
[1:34:34] the babbling Pentecostal babies
[1:34:37] Methodist Baptist whatever you want to
[1:34:40] say turn them to what back to the
[1:34:43] original word but that didn't do him any
[1:34:46] good as far as changing their body or
[1:34:48] even getting them to adoption that got
[1:34:50] them born again which is fine that's
[1:34:54] okay I told them out there I'm tell
[1:34:58] you this church the ministry in this
[1:35:01] church I am saying it because I know the
[1:35:05] ministry in this church the ministry in
[1:35:07] this church is not getting a bride ready
[1:35:13] boy you wake up on that one God's coming
[1:35:19] after a wife watch this I'll prove it to
[1:35:28] you right Anderson let's go ahead
[1:35:32] brother let's go ahead and insert that
[1:35:33] quote the one I inserted let's go do it
[1:35:38] the one right before first Thessalonians
[1:35:41] what's this on the first seal now listen
[1:35:45] this is his new ministry this is 1963
[1:35:48] now watch he said he would be known in
[1:35:51] the last day but it comes forth in a
[1:35:52] church symbol do you understand it
[1:35:54] Church church come forth in a symbol of
[1:35:58] a church that they know there is a seal
[1:36:00] but just what it is yet they don't know
[1:36:02] oh this is a horse rider and it only is
[1:36:05] to be revealed at the last day when this
[1:36:08] actual seal is broken broken - who not
[1:36:12] to Christ but to the church notice now
[1:36:15] oh my that just makes me tremble
[1:36:18] something happened he been saying Church
[1:36:22] church Church church Church that just
[1:36:26] makes me tremble I hope that the church
[1:36:29] truly understands it see what I mean you
[1:36:32] people watch him now I'm going to call
[1:36:35] you bride there is not another quote
[1:36:40] that says that in this whole message
[1:36:44] that's the only quote I put in call you
[1:36:47] bride and that's the only quote that
[1:36:49] comes up I'm going to call you
[1:36:53] bride see that you'll understand it so
[1:36:59] the bride is the only one to understand
[1:37:01] the first part of his message and him
[1:37:03] identifying that it's only to the bride
[1:37:06] now
[1:37:08] it's not to the church its to the bride
[1:37:13] because watch now watch him continue on
[1:37:18] let's read this one the voice is a
[1:37:21] thunder the voice came from where from
[1:37:24] the throne where the lamb had just left
[1:37:27] as intercessor intercessor for who and
[1:37:32] where is the throne now he's standing
[1:37:38] here to take his position and his claim
[1:37:42] now who's he claiming he's claiming us
[1:37:47] but where does he come from but the
[1:37:52] Thunder came from the inside and the
[1:38:01] lamb was standing out here oh my talked
[1:38:07] about a revival I just read that a few
[1:38:08] minutes ago I had to put this in and the
[1:38:11] lamb was standing out here and the
[1:38:15] thunder where the lamb had left the
[1:38:17] Father's throne to take his own throne
[1:38:19] now what is our promise in the seventh
[1:38:23] church age that we would sit in his role
[1:38:29] as he said on the Father's throne
[1:38:32] it was the Father's throne down through
[1:38:34] 7 Church ages now this is the throne
[1:38:37] that he's always wanted to sit on
[1:38:43] he called you bride but I'm gonna tell
[1:38:47] you something from that point on it was
[1:38:52] my responsibility and your
[1:38:54] responsibility to maturity into a wife
[1:38:59] because in revelations 19 it says his
[1:39:02] wife has made herself ready his wife has
[1:39:09] made herself ready you take the analogy
[1:39:14] of brother I mused about the armored
[1:39:16] meat packing man ok they ain't got
[1:39:19] married yet so you can't use it all the
[1:39:20] way but I'm going to use this
[1:39:21] far enough remember he goes away he said
[1:39:24] one year one year from this day I'll be
[1:39:26] back now listen that woman that he
[1:39:31] thought so much of and he was going to
[1:39:34] wait one year to marry her he was going
[1:39:36] to wait 2,000 years to come back and get
[1:39:41] her now I promise you one thing
[1:39:44] she didn't go sit on the porch and wait
[1:39:47] for a year she got ready and listened
[1:39:55] she had to do it by herself cuz all the
[1:39:58] mother sister said he's not coming back
[1:40:03] after you he's coming back to get us
[1:40:06] she said whatever he told me he told me
[1:40:14] that he said he's coming back for me and
[1:40:18] I'm gonna get myself ready I'm not going
[1:40:22] to be and she wasn't in the barn with
[1:40:25] slop up to her knees when he got bashed
[1:40:28] no she was standing on the porch and
[1:40:33] here he come because she had made
[1:40:35] herself ready amen
[1:40:42] now let's show this in Jesus's ministry
[1:40:45] back up brother Anderson I'm sorry back
[1:40:47] up to were back up to number let's go
[1:40:55] back to number four like I said we're
[1:40:57] gonna be another 20 minutes so just deal
[1:41:00] with it we'll go outside and talk about
[1:41:01] everything else for another hour so
[1:41:04] because remember with this God has a
[1:41:07] provided an original way to do things
[1:41:09] and he'll never do it contrary to that
[1:41:10] see that's why we can depend on the Word
[1:41:12] of God we can depend on brother Browns
[1:41:13] message because he gave us the road map
[1:41:15] and it's not going to change it's not
[1:41:17] gonna change it's going to happen
[1:41:19] exactly the way that he said it was
[1:41:21] going to happen they promised in the
[1:41:23] last days that he would and it sent them
[1:41:25] us the message and this message would
[1:41:27] have the same identification as a larger
[1:41:29] light return the Baptist and it would
[1:41:31] turn the hearts of the people not to the
[1:41:32] denomination but back to the original
[1:41:34] fathers back to the word how these
[1:41:37] things have been what vindicated
[1:41:39] how did in the sounding of the last
[1:41:41] angel in the days of the seventh angel
[1:41:42] these mysteries that's all been why did
[1:41:45] the Methodists do this to Baptist do
[1:41:46] this church across Java witness all do
[1:41:49] this their mysteries will be revealed in
[1:41:51] the last day when the seventh angel
[1:41:52] seventh angels message not when he
[1:41:54] starts out doing this remember there's
[1:41:57] one quote and I don't know if I have it
[1:41:58] or not we're brother Brown says not in
[1:42:00] the healing campaign listen the healing
[1:42:02] campaign what got their attention you
[1:42:05] don't catch fish with just baked it's
[1:42:09] got to be a bait in the hook so the
[1:42:13] healing ministry will be the bait but
[1:42:16] the hook is the bride getting ready
[1:42:19] because you got to have that hook to
[1:42:21] what a man brother Branham was catching
[1:42:25] trout he was catching them not when he
[1:42:29] starts out doing this but when he begins
[1:42:33] to sound his message so see he sounded a
[1:42:37] message that's brought it to a bride and
[1:42:39] he says in 1963 now I call you bride
[1:42:42] well now everything after that it's
[1:42:47] already bride it's already bride if
[1:42:50] you're born again you already bride but
[1:42:53] to fulfill revelations 19 to get to come
[1:42:56] back after a wife there's gotta
[1:42:59] something happen not the years in
[1:43:03] preparation but when he begins to sound
[1:43:05] the message these mysteries then shall
[1:43:08] be revealed and here they are not
[1:43:10] knowing them and you people are a
[1:43:13] witness of that number five works his
[1:43:18] faith expression 1965 but remember
[1:43:20] Abraham wasn't in Sodom he was already
[1:43:23] called out and there was one state and
[1:43:28] talked to him and the one state and
[1:43:31] talked to him showed him a sign with his
[1:43:34] back turned he said Sarah was going to
[1:43:36] have that baby that he had waited on a
[1:43:39] man with his back turned and he called
[1:43:41] it God Elohim now that's where people
[1:43:43] put brother Branham so close to God cuz
[1:43:46] remember I think sister clay there was
[1:43:48] they were at the marriage into what she
[1:43:50] was sitting there when he preached
[1:43:51] marriage and divorce right there was one
[1:43:53] part of that of that time of preaching
[1:43:56] that in the Parkview whatever it was
[1:43:58] High School where he turned his back
[1:44:01] remember he turned his back and he's
[1:44:03] looking out this window out this way
[1:44:06] well that was God showing us that God
[1:44:09] was here
[1:44:10] dr. brother Branham was God but that God
[1:44:13] was here using him to show us where
[1:44:17] we're living and that was in 1965
[1:44:20] February right before he went off the
[1:44:22] scene about ten months later now that
[1:44:24] brings us to pass today because we have
[1:44:27] faith and I know this is of God it's
[1:44:31] because this in other scriptures point
[1:44:33] to this our revelations Tencent in the
[1:44:36] hour of the seventh angels message when
[1:44:38] he begins to send forth his message not
[1:44:40] in a healing service I'm telling you
[1:44:45] what he said not in a healing service
[1:44:49] but the message that follows the healing
[1:44:53] service go see this what happened I know
[1:44:58] I know none of you remember the first
[1:45:00] message I preached in this church in
[1:45:02] November of 1998 or 99 I preached a
[1:45:07] message first message they ever preached
[1:45:10] and I brought the parallel with brother
[1:45:12] Branham and Jesus Christ most of you
[1:45:15] thought I was talking about brother
[1:45:16] Branham cuz they're their ministry is so
[1:45:18] close and it's got to be close it's the
[1:45:20] Ministry of Jesus Christ but look what
[1:45:22] happened Jesus went forth and preached
[1:45:24] he healed the sick and everything old
[1:45:26] that young rabbi that prophet he's a
[1:45:28] great fellow brother branham he's a
[1:45:29] great guy you got to get him in here
[1:45:31] bring you know ten thousand people and
[1:45:33] we're gonna see a miracle we want him in
[1:45:37] our church but one day he stood and said
[1:45:41] I and my father are one
[1:45:46] they didn't want him no more
[1:45:49] when brother Brian preached the seals he
[1:45:51] said thousands of my friends when he
[1:45:53] preached marriage and divorce
[1:45:54] he said thousands of my friends will go
[1:45:56] away from me he stood alone at the end
[1:45:59] of his message
[1:46:00] why because nobody understood him
[1:46:02] and it wasn't for them that part of that
[1:46:06] message was not for those people in that
[1:46:08] age that was not their box their box was
[1:46:11] coming he's here except you eat the
[1:46:16] flesh of the Son of Man and drink his
[1:46:17] blood he didn't explain it said except
[1:46:21] you eat the flesh of the Son of Man
[1:46:22] drinks his blood you have no life why I
[1:46:23] imagine them doctors and nurses sitting
[1:46:26] this fellow's a vampire trying to get us
[1:46:28] to drink his blood see they didn't
[1:46:30] understand it he knowed it so dear
[1:46:33] brother branham but them disciples look
[1:46:38] at me but them disciples oh it's not a
[1:46:43] one-man show anymore huh
[1:46:46] and it to me it's no show but it's not a
[1:46:49] one-man doctrine anymore a one-man
[1:46:51] message it was at one time but them
[1:46:53] disciples they might not have been able
[1:46:56] to explain it but they sat down and
[1:47:00] believed it anyhow a man for it was
[1:47:02] revealed to them yes sir they know that
[1:47:05] the Scriptures had declared it listen
[1:47:06] you didn't have to tell the Apostle Paul
[1:47:08] not to eat Jesus's flesh and drink his
[1:47:10] wood he knew the revelation behind that
[1:47:15] Peter knew the revelation behind that
[1:47:17] you and I know the revelation behind it
[1:47:20] that's why as this thing gets closer to
[1:47:22] the end we're not gonna be popular
[1:47:25] people even in the message you're not
[1:47:28] gonna be popular people cuz you're gonna
[1:47:29] speak a language that a lot of people
[1:47:31] don't know excuse me they know that the
[1:47:39] Scriptures had declared it
[1:47:46] first Thessalonians 4 for this we say
[1:47:56] unto you by the word of the Lord that we
[1:47:58] remember I told you a couple weeks ago
[1:48:00] God showed me a scripture of this
[1:48:02] scripture right here is to no one but
[1:48:05] you and I know one for this we say unto
[1:48:11] you by the word of the Lord that we
[1:48:12] which are alive and remain unto the
[1:48:15] coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[1:48:17] them with your sleep for the Lord
[1:48:21] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:48:23] shout the voice of the Archangel and
[1:48:26] Trump of God let's stop right there
[1:48:28] Paul was prophesying he never saw this
[1:48:36] he's telling the vision he saw a vision
[1:48:41] he didn't know who it was but he saw a
[1:48:43] vision he didn't know it was Donnie
[1:48:45] faught Bush and you know you know I said
[1:48:46] the other day about brother Bram seeing
[1:48:48] this third part of the of the Seventh
[1:48:50] Seal opened up in an unknown language
[1:48:51] why he didn't know what it was he didn't
[1:48:52] know who was sitting here didn't know
[1:48:53] anybody a certain group of people but
[1:48:57] somebody did for the Lord himself shall
[1:48:59] descend from heaven with a shout what
[1:49:01] was the shout we've heard it what was
[1:49:05] the voice we've heard it and we're
[1:49:08] waiting on the voice of the Archangel
[1:49:10] which is white like brother down said
[1:49:12] this morning
[1:49:12] what is the work of the voice of the
[1:49:14] Archangel brother Graham said that was
[1:49:16] the resurrection the resurrection angel
[1:49:20] and where brother brother Dale said this
[1:49:23] morning brother Brahm said where's the
[1:49:24] resurrection that oh it's out yonder
[1:49:26] somewhere it's in a book but I just say
[1:49:31] it's in you so you are a total recipient
[1:49:37] of this scripture right here you're
[1:49:41] gonna hear and be participating in all
[1:49:45] three the voice of the Archangel and
[1:49:48] with the Trump of God where's the
[1:49:52] trumpet going to sound to do to to to to
[1:49:54] we're gonna have to call the
[1:49:56] Philadelphia Philharmonic Orchestra to
[1:49:59] come out here
[1:49:59] the Mormon Tabernacle Choir that beats
[1:50:01] kind of strange moment rattling you know
[1:50:03] what
[1:50:04] there we go with external you said oh
[1:50:07] that must be somebody's gonna shout
[1:50:12] somebody's gonna have a voice and we're
[1:50:16] gonna hear a Trump where is it going to
[1:50:21] come from you it's gonna come from you
[1:50:26] and the dead in Christ shall rise first
[1:50:31] then we I circled that in my Bible we
[1:50:40] which are alive and remain shall be
[1:50:43] caught up together with them in the
[1:50:45] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[1:50:48] so shall we ever be with the Lord you
[1:50:50] know comfort each other with these words
[1:50:52] but you know Paul just kind of mmm not
[1:50:55] to be sacrilegious but that's a little
[1:50:57] vague it's this so shall with ever be
[1:51:00] with the Lord but we had a prophet with
[1:51:03] some high definition visions to tell us
[1:51:07] exactly how that's going to happen we're
[1:51:09] going to go to a wedding supper for
[1:51:11] three and a half years and then we're
[1:51:12] going to walk come back into millennium
[1:51:14] and we're going to live a thousand years
[1:51:17] in the Millennium and then we're gonna
[1:51:18] be taken off the earth and God's gonna
[1:51:20] watch this whole thing off and there's
[1:51:22] gonna be a future home come down that's
[1:51:24] made for me and you brother Brown took
[1:51:26] all them scriptures and put them
[1:51:28] together where Paul didn't Paul just
[1:51:30] said it so shall we ever be with the
[1:51:32] Lord he really didn't explain the
[1:51:33] specifics you know why wasn't time for
[1:51:35] it but now it's time for it it's time
[1:51:39] that you and I know every move that God
[1:51:41] makes you should know it wherefore
[1:51:50] comfort one another with these words for
[1:51:53] 2,000 years they've been doing that
[1:51:55] comforting each other but we've come to
[1:51:59] a place now where we're not going to
[1:52:01] comfort each other with those words
[1:52:02] we're gonna live them we're gonna be
[1:52:05] that word made manifest look at number 6
[1:52:07] real quick I may not get finished but
[1:52:09] you know what that's okay
[1:52:13] and Sabina Kenyon he said this is the
[1:52:15] third pole now there's three great
[1:52:17] things that goes with it one folder
[1:52:18] today or yesterday the other one in
[1:52:21] folder today and there's one I cannot
[1:52:22] interpret because it's in an unknown
[1:52:23] language but I was standing right there
[1:52:25] and looking right straight at it this is
[1:52:27] the third poll coming up what is the
[1:52:29] third poll the third poll is the opening
[1:52:30] of the word it's not a tent vision it's
[1:52:32] not all these other things people want
[1:52:34] to say it is it's the revealing of the
[1:52:37] word revealing Christ Christ in you and
[1:52:40] where he's at he's in you all right
[1:52:43] that's all reason the reason all heaven
[1:52:46] was solid you know why why why is there
[1:52:50] something going on so great in there
[1:52:52] silence so total secret it's a secret
[1:53:06] listen le azar took Rebecca by the hand
[1:53:15] and told her about Isaac told her every
[1:53:23] move everything he liked everything he
[1:53:27] didn't like he told her how he looked
[1:53:31] how he walked
[1:53:33] what if mannerism was he told her all
[1:53:37] that so that when Rebecca was in a field
[1:53:45] riding on camel and I'm sure they wasn't
[1:53:48] just one man standing out in that field
[1:53:50] it was probably a bunch of servants and
[1:53:53] people standing out there in the field
[1:53:54] but Eliezer had told Rebecca a vision
[1:54:01] and made that vision so real that she
[1:54:06] looked and she said there he is but now
[1:54:09] remember remember le azar his work was
[1:54:14] done it three's a crowd when you go to a
[1:54:18] honeymoon okay
[1:54:21] I hope you realize that one day three's
[1:54:25] a crowd when you go to honeymoon why
[1:54:27] eliazar stepped off the scene because he
[1:54:33] had taught he done his job brother Brown
[1:54:36] done his job he entered it he said I now
[1:54:39] call you bride and now bride I want you
[1:54:43] to take this message and it's going to
[1:54:46] be a secret it's not gonna be some great
[1:54:48] denomination we're not gonna have this
[1:54:50] great big move of God anymore it's gonna
[1:54:54] be a secret cause Ellie's are probably
[1:55:01] told other people about Isaac and it
[1:55:06] really didn't click but remember he said
[1:55:10] whatever woman walks up to this well and
[1:55:13] feeds asked me to feed my camel what one
[1:55:17] woman he went looking for one woman and
[1:55:22] he found her because he had asked God he
[1:55:26] said god I gotta get somebody for Isaac
[1:55:30] and I gotta get her ready and I gotta
[1:55:33] introduce her to Isaac but I know once I
[1:55:38] introduced her to Isaac I got to step
[1:55:40] off the scene my job is finished but
[1:55:45] what happened was truth be known
[1:55:48] whatever le azar told Rebecca became a
[1:55:53] part of Rebecca became a part of Rebecca
[1:55:58] because what Rebecca did is when she
[1:55:59] looked and saw him what eleazar's voice
[1:56:03] was in the back of her head he's got
[1:56:06] this kind of walk he's got this kind of
[1:56:08] talk he's got this kind of mannerism he
[1:56:10] she had to be told by somebody what
[1:56:16] Christ looked like and what mannerisms
[1:56:19] he would have same way with Mordecai
[1:56:23] Mordecai and you know I love to presume
[1:56:26] I had done it a long time but whom
[1:56:28] Esther
[1:56:29] now what Mordecai and Esther the king in
[1:56:31] the chamber
[1:56:34] but Mordecai what nurtured her here do
[1:56:40] this do that do this present this do
[1:56:42] this do that then they had all the
[1:56:44] Chamberlain's around Chamber
[1:56:46] Chamberlain's around her telling her he
[1:56:49] likes this he likes that mmm preachers
[1:56:55] listen we got a vision I told the church
[1:57:00] last Sunday I said my vision is it's to
[1:57:03] present a wife to Christ not a bride cuz
[1:57:06] I know I know and I'm listen I just want
[1:57:08] to tell you this I'm not a salvation
[1:57:10] preacher you should know that I don't
[1:57:14] try to get people to come to the altar
[1:57:17] but I know my position I want to take
[1:57:21] somebody that's already a bride
[1:57:23] somebody's got to do it that's already a
[1:57:25] bride and teach her how to be a wife but
[1:57:29] now there are other people in the
[1:57:30] fivefold ministry brother Bob brother
[1:57:32] Aaron Louise brother down he fulfills
[1:57:36] them all then we'll preach you that but
[1:57:39] I just it's not my make up you know that
[1:57:41] cuz I don't have a pole to bring people
[1:57:43] to the altar I want you to get in your
[1:57:45] seat I want you to comes to remember our
[1:57:48] mature wife will I mat or wife will know
[1:57:52] exactly what God wants at any point in
[1:57:55] time but it's going to be a secret why
[1:57:58] is it going to be a secret because
[1:57:59] remember this thing is honing down not
[1:58:02] to organizations not to numbers not to
[1:58:05] thousands God had a great church one
[1:58:09] time the founding Church of Christianity
[1:58:13] was twelve people and that's as many
[1:58:17] people as we have on our stage if
[1:58:19] they're all there playing music twelve
[1:58:22] people but you know what they all had to
[1:58:24] wholly go
[1:58:25] they all had power under that first
[1:58:28] Church age everybody okay but this all
[1:58:35] was a three-fold mystery but let's go to
[1:58:38] number nine brother and we'll stop right
[1:58:40] here we know what the threefold part
[1:58:43] everything is in addition your new burst
[1:58:45] and a three-fold justification
[1:58:48] about to he'll go so everything God does
[1:58:49] in threefold remember the sixth seal
[1:58:52] open in a three-fold manner
[1:58:53] remember that all right the seventh seal
[1:58:57] opened in a three-fold manner and then
[1:59:01] he comes to cross the mystery God
[1:59:02] revealed and he said now if you're
[1:59:03] missing the seals come back to this
[1:59:04] message this message is not Jesus Christ
[1:59:07] as a mystery of God reveal it's Christ
[1:59:09] it's the mystery of God revealed going
[1:59:12] right back to revealing Christ alright
[1:59:15] cuz remember you're not Jesus but you
[1:59:19] are Christ you can't be Jesus Christ
[1:59:22] you'd be misses Jesus Christ but you
[1:59:25] can't be Jesus Christ he's one person
[1:59:28] but you can be Christ because it's
[1:59:32] revealing Christ and where is he he's in
[1:59:35] you all right now look now God has had a
[1:59:40] three-fold purpose in this great mystery
[1:59:42] secret now what was a great mystery
[1:59:44] secret all God was he poured in the
[1:59:46] cross cost in the church we're gonna
[1:59:47] read it mmm God in this great mystery
[1:59:49] secret that he had before the world
[1:59:51] fixing the telus division fixin to tell
[1:59:55] us division some of you're watching the
[1:59:59] vision at the bank II eyelids God in
[2:00:02] this great mystery secret that he had
[2:00:04] before the world began planning purpose
[2:00:08] gonna see it come to pass God in His
[2:00:12] great mystery secret that he had before
[2:00:13] the world began he's got a three-fold
[2:00:15] purpose in it so the whole purpose is
[2:00:18] these three things he's fixing to tell
[2:00:20] us right here and now what we want to go
[2:00:24] upon this morning is what is that
[2:00:26] three-fold purpose now I believe by the
[2:00:30] help of God now look how confident
[2:00:33] brother Branham is who is present can
[2:00:42] you say that today who is present and
[2:00:46] he'll show it to us now did God come
[2:00:50] down and say okay I'm the second person
[2:00:52] of eternity here I am I'm gonna tell he
[2:00:55] revealed it right through that little
[2:00:56] man called William Branham ma'am mm-hmm
[2:00:59] now if he had this three
[2:01:01] full purpose we want to find out what is
[2:01:04] this threefold purpose first thing was
[2:01:06] that God wanted to reveal himself to the
[2:01:08] people he couldn't do it is too great
[2:01:12] Jehovah who covered all space-time and
[2:01:13] eternity he could not he's too great to
[2:01:16] ever be revealed to people now if he'd
[2:01:20] have stopped right there we would all
[2:01:22] been in bad shape but he kept going
[2:01:26] because it would be too mysterious how
[2:01:29] could that great beam that never did
[2:01:31] begin we're gonna put it back together
[2:01:41] in a minute though never did begin that
[2:01:43] after you went beyond the cycle 100
[2:01:45] billions trillions of years alive space
[2:01:47] infinity that's eternal the great
[2:01:49] creature that was all that and still is
[2:01:52] but what he wanted to do he loved
[2:01:54] fatherhood he was the father and the
[2:01:56] only way he could express it was become
[2:01:57] a son of man and what is the son of man
[2:02:00] Word made flesh all right
[2:02:03] that is the reason Jesus kept saying the
[2:02:05] son of man see they didn't know what he
[2:02:07] was talking about many of them but now
[2:02:10] you get it
[2:02:12] congregation says amen he wanted to
[2:02:15] express itself that was his one of his
[2:02:18] great threefold purposes was to express
[2:02:20] himself identify himself with human
[2:02:23] beings to reveal his self in Christ
[2:02:25] second to have the preeminence in his
[2:02:28] body of believers that is his bride that
[2:02:32] he might live in people not with people
[2:02:34] in people all right keep going when I
[2:02:39] think of it I just see denominations
[2:02:41] pass off the scene and everything else
[2:02:42] go and see when I see God's great
[2:02:44] purpose revealing himself and having
[2:02:47] first to reveal himself in Christ not in
[2:02:51] a Trinity not in it in Christ the
[2:02:56] trueness the fullness of the Godhead
[2:02:59] bodily
[2:02:59] and then to bring that fullness of the
[2:03:02] Godhead bodily
[2:03:03] bodily partly into a people that's not
[2:03:08] what he said and then to bring that
[2:03:11] fullness of Godhead bodily into a peace
[2:03:15] so that he can have the preeminence is
[2:03:18] the oversight of the leading a people
[2:03:20] not one person a people we're a mini
[2:03:24] membered body we can't get away from
[2:03:26] that all right let's go to the next one
[2:03:30] first to express itself completely God
[2:03:35] in Christ second to have the preeminence
[2:03:38] by this in his church which is his body
[2:03:44] the bride till he can have the premises
[2:03:49] to express himself through them through
[2:03:54] them not through him through them and
[2:03:59] thirdly to restore the kingdom look at
[2:04:02] me to restore the kingdom to its
[2:04:05] rightful position everything right back
[2:04:08] together oh yeah there was a little bit
[2:04:11] of time gap where there was some sin
[2:04:13] come in but you know what it didn't
[2:04:14] change these two pieces of paper this is
[2:04:17] a piece of paper and so is this it never
[2:04:20] changed we just lost the way remember I
[2:04:24] told you brother branham tells us that
[2:04:26] Jesus didn't come to bring us an
[2:04:27] inheritance he didn't I've read that
[2:04:31] quote a hundred times he came to what
[2:04:35] bring us back to our inheritance yeah we
[2:04:43] lost it how about lost it then but to
[2:04:47] bring us back to our inheritance because
[2:04:48] remember our inheritance was what this
[2:04:51] piece of paper
[2:04:52] he just got tore apart jesus said I am
[2:04:55] the way the truth and the life and I'm
[2:04:57] going to bring it back together but what
[2:04:58] happened was right in here somewhere man
[2:05:01] started dealing in it and it started
[2:05:03] doing this and there's no way false
[2:05:06] doctrines does this so we had to have a
[2:05:10] prophet come to give us clarity so that
[2:05:13] it'll fit right back and you know what I
[2:05:16] tore that and you'll never be able to
[2:05:18] put back right but you know what God can
[2:05:20] God's gonna put that thing right back
[2:05:23] together thirdly to restore the kingdom
[2:05:25] to it's rightly positioned that fell by
[2:05:27] sin by the first item
[2:05:29] back to where he walked in the cool of
[2:05:30] the evening with his people talked with
[2:05:34] them fellowshipped
[2:05:35] with them brother branham calls you
[2:05:39] bride back in 1963 at the opening of the
[2:05:43] seals that narrows it down taking it
[2:05:45] from the church down to a bride because
[2:05:49] remember he'd used Church and bride all
[2:05:51] down through there but now he even says
[2:05:54] here he corrects his self by this in his
[2:05:56] church
[2:05:57] this is 1963 right after the seals which
[2:06:00] is his body the bride not just the
[2:06:03] church listen if you're not born again
[2:06:06] you're not in the body you're not part
[2:06:09] of the body if you're not born again
[2:06:11] okay so the bride is part of his body
[2:06:14] and listen you and I will be made known
[2:06:19] like I said before about this right here
[2:06:21] not by out not by external it'll become
[2:06:24] everything internal it's got to come in
[2:06:26] here first sure you got to hear it
[2:06:28] external you got to hear it but if it
[2:06:31] stays up here it's just intellect but if
[2:06:33] it'll drop down to right here in that
[2:06:35] center part and let that button continue
[2:06:38] to grow I don't think I have anymore
[2:06:40] that old that all the quote I think it
[2:06:43] is maybe mm-hmm is that there one more
[2:06:46] I've lost my page if not that's it they
[2:06:49] shut me down so anyway but all God was
[2:06:53] he poured into Christ
[2:06:54] now where's Christ qasas in you God has
[2:06:59] told us now where he's at but now John
[2:07:01] just to finish that but what's inside of
[2:07:03] you is gonna take you back to before the
[2:07:08] fall I came from God and I'm going back
[2:07:12] to God I came from the eternal mind of
[2:07:15] God mm-hmm and I honestly tell you this
[2:07:19] with all sincerity God didn't just think
[2:07:22] of me he thought Adolph Hitler he
[2:07:29] thought of Judas Iscariot he thought of
[2:07:32] sinners but the literal part of me
[2:07:37] that's working today inside of me is his
[2:07:41] mind
[2:07:44] you said I was too strong no I don't
[2:07:46] think you're strong enough because
[2:07:50] remember one time that vision had to
[2:07:55] either become a reality or it was
[2:07:58] already a reality god don't just do you
[2:08:01] understand what I'm saying God don't
[2:08:02] just make up think no he had a vision a
[2:08:06] planning the purpose and he saw you in
[2:08:08] it if he knew you would sit here and
[2:08:10] listen and become bribed he knew that so
[2:08:14] what is that that's not a second person
[2:08:18] remember this is a piece of paper and
[2:08:23] this is the piece of paper it's not
[2:08:27] paper and plastic if you're born again
[2:08:32] today you always were
[2:08:34] eternal you always were eternally
[2:08:39] there's not a day that you weren't when
[2:08:42] that part of you is the eternal part of
[2:08:45] God and then let's stand our feet what's
[2:08:50] next brother wait what's next I just
[2:08:53] told you what's next take us back to the
[2:08:58] Garden of Eden have a body change in a
[2:09:01] resurrection got to get the Saints out
[2:09:03] of the ground first we got to hear that
[2:09:04] voice musicians come got to hear that
[2:09:07] voice but that voice is gonna come from
[2:09:11] inside of you
[2:09:22] the Bible tells us there's no weapon
[2:09:25] formed against us that will prevail you
[2:09:29] know what that is there's no weapon
[2:09:34] there's no weapon form there's no
[2:09:36] external force that will ever take you
[2:09:40] down but there is an internal force that
[2:09:43] will take you down if you don't get born
[2:09:44] again if you don't sit under the Word of
[2:09:47] God and listen there be an internal
[2:09:48] force will take you down but thank God
[2:09:51] that we've had a prophet bring us a
[2:09:53] message and that you and I are able to
[2:09:56] read it in our own language don't need
[2:10:01] an interpretation we got all 1,100
[2:10:03] sermons when you understand every one of
[2:10:05] them not like some people over in
[2:10:07] overseas in different places they have a
[2:10:09] hard time interpreting and then some of
[2:10:12] them don't have but a couple of hundred
[2:10:14] bucks listen we got the whole thing well
[2:10:15] now they're doing better but used to but
[2:10:19] I'll tell you then people in those
[2:10:21] foreign countries they're sincere and
[2:10:24] you get one that's a good one he knows
[2:10:27] cuz you know what God's not gonna say
[2:10:29] well I'm gonna reveal it all to the
[2:10:31] Americans no you know what we are under
[2:10:36] condemnation worse than they are because
[2:10:39] God sent us a prophet to our homeland in
[2:10:41] our own voice in our own dialect
[2:10:44] southern so we can understand him and
[2:10:51] then we still reject it or turn it down
[2:10:53] or make it into something else that's
[2:10:54] why America is gonna get it before
[2:10:56] anybody else does just because we
[2:10:58] rejected not we US but America has
[2:11:00] rejected but you know what America is
[2:11:05] rejecting you America is rejecting you
[2:11:11] we are rejected and despised group of
[2:11:14] people and it's gonna get worse cuz
[2:11:18] remember I told you our downfall listen
[2:11:23] I'm gonna tell you this and no English
[2:11:25] say no more our downfall that's not what
[2:11:27] they're doing in jeffersonville our
[2:11:31] downfall is what we put up with
[2:11:33] our downfall is what we let in our
[2:11:36] downfall that's what we do and don't do
[2:11:38] don't come to church don't read our
[2:11:40] Bible don't study don't do the things of
[2:11:41] God it's our problem not their problem
[2:11:44] and then so whatever you want to take
[2:11:48] that any way you want to that's not
[2:11:49] gonna harm me or help me but I know one
[2:11:52] thing's for sure if you stay in Christ
[2:11:54] he'll keep you in this word and it'll
[2:11:57] never fail it'll do exactly what it said
[2:12:00] it would do and no external force no
[2:12:03] external happening it's going to make
[2:12:06] you bright or not bright it's what
[2:12:09] happens inside you become bright from
[2:12:12] the inside and let it work its way out I
[2:12:14] mean let's sing let's sing a song god

[2:14:22] the seals so that's that's some of the
[2:14:24] whole thing up all God was he poured
[2:14:27] into Christ all Christ reported any me
[2:14:29] and you and he's taking us back to the
[2:14:32] Garden of Eden he's taking us back past
[2:14:35] where there was sin but here's the bad
[2:14:38] part but somebody's got to come to a
[2:14:41] place of perfection be Christians if you
[2:14:45] want to and you can shout like you did
[2:14:46] this morning my brother Dells to being a
[2:14:48] baby listen I don't mind being a baby I
[2:14:51] won't stay a baby though it be
[2:14:55] malnourished for Sterling to well anyway

[2:15:02] say mama I need to do you change my
[2:15:04] diaper at 20
[2:15:08] for 2223 there'd be something wrong with
[2:15:15] that picture

[2:15:20] come from diapers to now most of us have
[2:15:24] always faces red now but but that's the
[2:15:28] way God is though doctor want us to stay
[2:15:30] babies he's telling us to grow up you're
[2:15:34] already you know sterling with a helm
[2:15:36] when he was born when he came out crying
[2:15:38] he was a he'll he was born in the family
[2:15:41] came tonight
[2:15:43] no way genetically he came out tonight
[2:15:48] why can't it be the same way
[2:15:51] that when we're birthdays Christians the
[2:15:54] world can't deny the world came deny who
[2:15:59] our Father is the world can't deny where
[2:16:02] we come from oh yeah well we got all
[2:16:05] these things here well we got all these
[2:16:07] things but you know what don't stay
[2:16:10] babies don't be happy being a baby
[2:16:15] please don't you know what because that
[2:16:17] makes you lazy to just say oh well oh
[2:16:20] I'm born again brother Darrell said I
[2:16:22] was born again everything's fine I like
[2:16:23] being a baby
[2:16:24] I don't you don't either how many of you
[2:16:30] oh please I don't want to be a baby
[2:16:33] even brother Brown said if I could turn
[2:16:35] back time I wouldn't go back to being
[2:16:36] there
[2:16:38] that puts you in another time another
[2:16:40] period we're in this age right here to
[2:16:43] be a mature Christian somebody that's
[2:16:46] growing up in a the right kind of food I
[2:16:50] [Music]
[2:16:51] don't want to be a baby I like to be in
[2:16:55] a baby but you know what I don't have a
[2:16:56] lot of memory of being a baby naturally
[2:16:59] and you know what even spiritually if
[2:17:02] you've been in this thing a long time
[2:17:03] yeah there's some things that you but I
[2:17:05] need an updated revelation I need God to
[2:17:08] speak to me adult-to-adult
[2:17:11] now he will speak adult to baby but only
[2:17:15] just for a little while because I'm
[2:17:17] telling you you can grieve God grieve
[2:17:22] not the Holy Spirit I read it
[2:17:23] we're by your sealed until the day of
[2:17:25] your Redemption brother branham in the
[2:17:29] in the adoption series he said the Holy
[2:17:32] Ghost comes back to the Father and says
[2:17:34] all this one is just like you but now
[2:17:38] remember he also said the Holy Ghost
[2:17:40] goes back to the father and says this
[2:17:42] one ain't doing so well right you decide
[2:17:46] that he don't you decide that you decide
[2:17:49] how far you want to go do you want to
[2:17:51] stay a baby that's okay we'll say ashes
[2:17:54] to ashes dust to dust over your grave
[2:17:59] but I don't want to do that I want us to
[2:18:02] walk off this world off this earth and
[2:18:04] not have to look into death I don't want
[2:18:10] to do that and I don't I don't want you
[2:18:13] to do that I want you to strive to be a
[2:18:16] wife of Jesus Christ not a bride be a
[2:18:21] wife
[2:18:22] grow up no brother Branham says and I'll
[2:18:25] read it next time we come together I
[2:18:27] think I've already got it she has his
[2:18:30] potentials
[2:18:32] she is him she has his potential
[2:18:37] what is his potential hey listen Jesus
[2:18:39] Christ was a natural baby and he had to
[2:18:43] come to natural things but he was always
[2:18:46] God he was always God
[2:18:51] if you realize that then you'd this
[2:18:53] little thing called life and time and
[2:18:55] all these things that we go through
[2:18:56] pretty much nothing because remember all
[2:19:00] God sees is your piece of paper and his
[2:19:02] piece of paper and he's bringing it
[2:19:04] right back together to where that thing
[2:19:06] will come back to an eternity and
[2:19:09] remember this again this is two pieces
[2:19:12] of paper this is one piece of paper that
[2:19:16] was tore apart by us and gods putting
[2:19:19] that one piece of paper back together
[2:19:20] it's not paper and plastic so that way
[2:19:24] you can see where you came from let me
[2:19:29] do this real close where you came from
[2:19:33] what you're doing here go that's the
[2:19:37] part where my head is what you're doing
[2:19:39] here and where you going to this doesn't
[2:19:43] change eternal doesn't change position
[2:19:45] changes you're in this position here we
[2:19:48] know where we came from we know what
[2:19:51] we're doing here and we know what we're
[2:19:53] going back to thank God for that
[2:19:55] god bless you let's sing that on the day
[2:19:58] of Pentecost one more time or you oh you
[2:19:59] won't sing something else you saying
[2:20:01] whatever you want to know I'm not the
[2:20:04] song leader you saying it
[2:20:14] changed my life
[2:20:16] you thought I was worth keeping so you
[2:20:21] clean
[2:20:23] we pray to God to give you a good way
[2:20:26] lit he'll protect you ready to hear from
[2:20:34] the Word of God pray for bread the Royal

[2:20:54] each other
[2:20:55] don't put yourself on an island we
[2:20:59] depend on each other because you know
[2:21:01] what we're heard animals lambs only die
[2:21:07] down brother how lambs or sheep only die
[2:21:11] when they separate their self from the
[2:21:13] herd because that's what the line looks
[2:21:17] for he looks for one seperated he looks
[2:21:19] for one over here what he don't want to
[2:21:22] find them all he wants to find one don't
[2:21:25] separate everything brother Brown said
[2:21:27] find yourself closer together
[2:21:30] as the day approaches come to church
[2:21:33] read your Bible study pray for each
[2:21:35] person is here you don't have to call
[2:21:37] him by name listen we're a body so pray
[2:21:40] for the body pray for each one we've all
[2:21:42] gotten things that we need prayer for we
[2:21:45] all got things that we need we have
[2:21:47] needs but God knows them he knows how to
[2:21:50] deal with them a man loved the Lord
[2:21:54] let's pray the Heavenly Father we pray
[2:21:57] Lord that you would be with us as we
[2:21:59] continue our journey
[2:22:02] thank you for allowing us to come into
[2:22:04] this building and be covered by your
[2:22:10] word Lord we pray that everyone in this
[2:22:17] building would receive a little shot of
[2:22:22] rejuvenation that we'll all live a
[2:22:26] little closer to you Father that will
[2:22:27] count the things that as though they are
[2:22:31] not like Abraham not worrying about the
[2:22:34] external things Abraham could a lot of
[2:22:37] could have used a lot of things to not
[2:22:41] come to that promise but he said your
[2:22:44] God and you will make that promise come
[2:22:48] to pass so god I know your God and I
[2:22:51] know you're gonna make up the promises
[2:22:53] come to pass for our children that are
[2:22:55] not saved for our fathers mothers
[2:22:58] husbands brothers sisters wives every
[2:23:01] one of us need prayer father we pray
[2:23:03] that you will just be with us now take
[2:23:06] care of us lead us and guide us bind
[2:23:08] together closer to you Father we ask
[2:23:11] these things in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:23:12] and as the wheels turn going home may we
[2:23:16] be singing only believe all things are
[2:23:18] possible thank you Father for giving us
[2:23:22] the new birth for giving us a chance to
[2:23:26] learn more about you there's a lot of
[2:23:29] people in this world or never get a
[2:23:31] chance to even know you lord much less
[2:23:33] know more about you but Lord you gave us
[2:23:36] the open book we live and preach and
[2:23:40] breathe by the open book that everything
[2:23:43] has been given to this little bride to
[2:23:46] make her a wife and I pray that you
[2:23:49] would just do that father raise us up as
[2:23:51] brother Dale starts preaching on the
[2:23:52] statue of a perfect man maybe this lord
[2:23:55] I pray maybe this the last round that we
[2:23:57] that we have to take before we go to
[2:23:59] that body change before the resurrection
[2:24:01] that this last push there'll be one
[2:24:04] great push
[2:24:06] one great anointing before this thing
[2:24:08] takes over and the world turns into
[2:24:11] chaos but Lord you told us to a little
[2:24:15] profit that you're gonna come and get us
[2:24:16] before that happens and it will not be
[2:24:19] part of that father we pray that you
[2:24:21] would just be with us now and take care
[2:24:22] of us
[2:24:23] the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen
[2:24:26] you're dismissed god
