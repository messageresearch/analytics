[25:14] upon you to keep your word to do as you
[25:17] say you'll do and to honor your word
[25:20] because if we can bring the word before
[25:22] you the prophet said you're obligated to

[25:30] to us you're just obligated to your word
[25:33] we thank you just have your way bless

[25:56] you and we thank you in Jesus name
[26:00] amen Romans
[26:04] 7 and then we'll go into
[26:09] Zechariah know you not brethren for I
[26:11] speak to them that know the law how that
[26:14] the law hath dominion over a man as long
[26:16] as he liveth but the woman which hath an
[26:19] husband is bound by the law to her
[26:21] husband so long as he liveth but if the
[26:24] husband be dead she is loose from the
[26:26] law of her husband so then if while her
[26:28] husband liveth she be married to another
[26:30] man she shall be called an adulteress
[26:33] but if her husband be dead she is free
[26:35] from that law so that she is no
[26:37] adulterous though she be married to
[26:39] another man wherefore my brethren you
[26:42] also are become dead to the law by the
[26:45] body of Christ yet you should be married
[26:48] to another even to him who is raised
[26:49] from the dead that we should bring forth
[26:52] fruit unto God and when we were in the
[26:54] flesh the Motions of sin which were by
[26:56] the law did work in our members to bring
[26:59] forth fruit unto death but now we are
[27:02] delivered from the law that being dead
[27:04] wherein we were held that we should
[27:06] serve in the newness of spirit and not
[27:09] in the oldness of the letter
[27:11] amen now let's go to Zechariah and we'll
[27:14] just
[27:15] start verse two Zechariah
[27:19] 4 the angel came to him there in verse
[27:22] one wakened him and said unto me what
[27:25] seest thou and I said said I have looked
[27:28] and behold a Candlestick of gold with a
[27:31] bowl upon the top of it and his seven
[27:33] lamps there own and seven pipes to the
[27:36] seven lamps which are upon the top
[27:38] thereof and two olive trees by it one
[27:42] upon the right side of the bowl and the
[27:44] other upon the left side thereof so I
[27:47] answered and spake to the angel that
[27:49] talked with me saying what are these my
[27:52] Lord then the angel that talked with me
[27:55] answered and said unto me knowest not
[27:57] what these be and I said no my Lord then
[28:03] he answered and spake unto me saying
[28:05] this is the word of the Lord unto zerubu
[28:08] saying not by P might nor by power but
[28:12] by my spirit sayith the Lord of hosts
[28:14] who art thou oh great Mountain before
[28:17] zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and
[28:19] he shall bring forth a headstone thereof
[28:22] with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto
[28:26] it you may be SE the Lord at his
[28:28] Blessing to the reading of the
[28:31] word now
[28:34] we've we
[28:36] spent quite a Time speaking
[28:39] about the new birth and remember what
[28:41] we've tried to bring
[28:43] out that in the invisible Union the
[28:46] message we've asked you to
[28:48] read that the prophet in it
[28:53] explains that Paul is not speaking here
[28:56] on uh marriage and divorce he's just
[28:59] illustrating his point that is really
[29:02] speaking on Law and
[29:03] Grace and we covered then that you know
[29:08] we must first have one thing and that
[29:10] was the New
[29:12] Birth all right see we can talk about
[29:15] marriag and divorce try to get free from
[29:17] this or free from that you know uh can
[29:20] we be free and and we've made that to be
[29:22] the basis of U the uh headstone own
[29:28] Grace you know and it is it's great it's
[29:31] Grace it's amazing
[29:33] grace but yet there is how things than
[29:38] to just see that our natural lives are
[29:40] set
[29:41] free because we must go on further into
[29:44] the message than that and it's great to
[29:47] find out that we''re set free but how
[29:49] can we be free if we're not born again
[29:52] that's
[29:53] right see the prophet said that that the
[29:56] marriage and divorce was to his
[29:58] followers only well now his followers is
[30:01] those with the new birth cuz that's the
[30:03] only ones that can follow him the rest
[30:05] of it can't follow because they'll go
[30:08] off somewhere and miss it somewhere see
[30:11] the most important thing then is first
[30:13] to know that we have the new birth all
[30:16] right so we
[30:17] spent uh about three or four Services
[30:20] speaking of the new
[30:23] birth and it was very I think very
[30:26] needful Maybe you know company came in
[30:28] and different things and I didn't drop
[30:30] back as much as you would
[30:32] think because you know uh I believe we
[30:36] need to understand the new
[30:39] birth because in that if we understand
[30:42] the new birth how the soul is set free
[30:44] right right and we can follow that
[30:47] thought of the setting free of the soul
[30:50] of mankind and it becoming so uh
[30:56] Eternal and and becoming so perfect and
[31:00] and totally
[31:03] justified and we can see that that you
[31:08] as a person can die to their s that's
[31:12] right and become born
[31:14] again and it sets that to that Soul
[31:16] totally free well then that is the key
[31:20] to me to
[31:22] understand the even the things of
[31:25] marriage and divorce
[31:27] is because if we can't believe that
[31:29] we're free then we're not
[31:33] free if we can't believe we have eternal
[31:36] life we don't have it right if we can't
[31:39] believe the New Birth has made us just
[31:42] as in Soul now just as
[31:46] perfect and just as Eternal as almighty
[31:49] God is amen that's right then you
[31:55] know if if we can't believe believe that
[31:57] then we're we're Bound by something amen
[32:01] and that's the thing that we'll get to
[32:03] the next message by which is the law
[32:06] right right you know the thoughts of
[32:10] mankind Not Just the Ten Commandment law
[32:13] somebody hearing that law is any word
[32:16] that we have to try
[32:20] to Bitter ourselves right or whatever
[32:24] you know trying to appease an Angry God
[32:28] to follow you know to follow a set of
[32:30] rules or regulations or thoughts It all
[32:34] becomes law
[32:36] right and in doing that then if we can't
[32:41] believe that the new birth makes our
[32:43] soul free how could we ever believe or
[32:46] comprehend think of it have any concept
[32:50] or thought whatsoever as to a body
[32:54] being set free
[32:59] all right and then if we can't get that
[33:04] right how can we
[33:07] comprehend us dying to the
[33:11] law and if you don't get nothing out of
[33:13] the message today I pray you get this
[33:18] point we saw in the messages of the new
[33:21] birth that that old first husband that
[33:25] adamic nature
[33:28] he must be
[33:30] dead not just put away and pick him up
[33:33] later or you
[33:36] know he said well brother Dale you know
[33:39] I wouldn't do that but see just lay him
[33:43] aside and then come back and flirt with
[33:45] him and do things you
[33:49] know see that would be deaths because
[33:53] we'd be proven we wouldn't Born Again
[33:55] amen but see he's got to be dead ever
[33:57] respect of him that's right he said but
[33:58] brother Dale I have problems yes well
[34:02] all
[34:04] right is we're in this world as long as
[34:06] we're here we're going to have problems
[34:08] that's right do you think you'll ever
[34:10] come to a place boy one of these days
[34:12] you come to place I just won't have no
[34:14] more problems I won't think nothing else
[34:16] wrong I want
[34:21] to you might as well forget it that's
[34:24] right cuzz that'll never take place amen
[34:27] I can there's a lot of things I can't
[34:29] guarantee but I can guarantee that one
[34:32] the devil's not going to let
[34:35] us we're going to fight to be free
[34:37] that's right
[34:39] amen you know you think about the
[34:42] greatest battle ever fought you think
[34:45] about the battles of the world has been
[34:47] fought for the freedom of
[34:49] mankind but see the greatest battle in
[34:51] the world of anything all the wars and
[34:54] battles is nothing compared
[34:57] to what we're fighting now that's right
[34:59] amen we're fighting ourselves right
[35:03] because that's our worst enemy that's
[35:04] right right and self- condemnation yes
[35:08] right is the worst enemy anybody could
[35:10] have that's right see you'll never be
[35:13] free as long as you keep condemning
[35:15] yourself you said well you you don't
[35:17] think ought to repent I agree we ought
[35:19] to repent I do every day prophet of God
[35:22] said do we sin he said every day he said
[35:24] I sin every day so
[35:27] but see we don't want to get down to
[35:30] those things and earn it all
[35:33] out we want to be told how good we are
[35:36] well that's
[35:38] wonderful you know that's
[35:40] good but somebody's got to make us
[35:43] realize we need something to make us
[35:45] good right maybe that's not the right
[35:48] way of saying it but all right
[35:50] somebody's got to let us know where we
[35:52] stand yes that's right CU we don't know
[35:55] where we stand we can't be set free
[35:57] that's right amen and the worst bondage
[35:59] we will get to it eventually the worst
[36:01] bondage was like those Pharisees yes as
[36:04] I tell you they said to Jesus we were
[36:08] never in bondage to no
[36:12] man right that's right and right at that
[36:15] time they were under the Roman
[36:17] government that was killing them that's
[36:21] right but you see they still thought
[36:24] we're
[36:25] free well that's good
[36:27] good it's a good to think like
[36:30] that but I'd rather look at something
[36:33] straight up and just face it yes you
[36:37] know CU running from your enemies will
[36:39] never settle especially when you're own
[36:41] when you are your own enemy that's right
[36:44] amen that's why you have people you know
[36:47] changes churches and
[36:49] things because they're trying to find a
[36:52] place that'll tell them they're
[36:53] okay you know and you keep on mov moving
[36:57] after a while you're going to find one
[36:58] that let you you know they tell you
[37:01] you're okay right
[37:05] right but yet what good would that have
[37:08] done in the days of Martin Luther
[37:11] right for him to a change and started
[37:13] another
[37:15] church you know started another Catholic
[37:18] you know there are what two two
[37:20] Catholics Orthodox and the other
[37:22] something you
[37:23] know ever what those are there's two
[37:25] different kind kind of Catholics Romans
[37:28] and everything else and uh would just
[37:32] move over to another
[37:34] place and I'm sure he had tried to do
[37:37] many
[37:38] things but one day God spoke to him and
[37:42] said that just shall live by faith amen
[37:45] all right that anchored in the man's
[37:48] heart that he could face the world
[37:52] with like I always say about in the
[37:54] upper room there they were scared to
[37:56] death one wondering what was going to
[37:57] take place but when that Holy Ghost came
[38:01] amen they were not afraid anymore right
[38:04] all was well they wouldn't no
[38:08] problems they was ready to die right for
[38:12] what they
[38:13] believed and you know what they believ
[38:16] that the day before the Holy Ghost came
[38:19] right but they wern't ready to die
[38:21] that's right that's right so it makes a
[38:22] lot of difference that's right you
[38:25] remember the prophet said on marriage
[38:26] and divorce he said it's got to be
[38:27] revealed to you
[38:29] right that if it's not revealed you
[38:32] don't have it that's right all right now
[38:36] what I want us to do today is to take
[38:39] and I may this quote
[38:43] basically what I want you to think about
[38:47] if they're fast enough to grab it up and
[38:49] run it then that's good but if not I'm
[38:51] not concerned because I I just want to
[38:54] talk to Lula this is to Lula this is
[38:57] this is me talking to you if somebody
[39:00] else is trying to uh listen in you know
[39:03] and and understand or
[39:05] whatever uh that's
[39:09] fine check the message out and see where
[39:11] it's true or not that's
[39:14] right right but if we can't take the new
[39:18] birth and see that we're
[39:21] free in our soul right right then we'll
[39:26] never be free that's right that's right
[39:28] in this life
[39:31] right right and then we would never see
[39:34] as I said we we gave it and over and
[39:36] over and over where the Prophet said
[39:39] that Romans 7 was a
[39:43] prophecy and said he's
[39:46] illustrating that this is not talking
[39:48] about marriage and divorce he's
[39:50] illustrating it then he gets into
[39:53] invisible Union and
[39:54] says this is a greater portion right so
[39:59] there's something greater than the the
[40:02] the natural Grace of marriage and
[40:04] divorce or that's a caral way of saying
[40:07] it CU All Things Are Spiritual you know
[40:09] what I'm talking about the literal
[40:11] things of Life yes and I've told you
[40:14] what I believed I've done this not
[40:16] because anybody's here that's come here
[40:18] whatever has done I've told you this
[40:21] forever since I've been in the
[40:23] message I said it back probably now over
[40:27] 40 years
[40:29] ago and I have nobody in
[40:32] reference you
[40:34] know as to say well it's
[40:38] you but I've said it over and over to
[40:40] you this is not something new I come up
[40:42] and say and and people don't like for me
[40:44] to be that way they think I'm
[40:47] offensive but if we have a marital
[40:50] problem of the
[40:52] flesh if that cannot be set free
[40:57] made
[41:00] right brought to a complete
[41:04] understanding I said it 40 years ago I
[41:06] say it again we're going to die and go
[41:09] by the grave that's right that's right
[41:12] amen well you sure are a carnal preacher
[41:14] I agree with you but that's what I
[41:15] believe 40 years ago or more I still
[41:18] believe it today
[41:20] amen because see I believe the Bible
[41:23] said he that the son has set free it's
[41:27] free indeed amen amen that's right right
[41:30] that's right but if we can't believe
[41:32] that it's for us that's right amen yes
[41:37] sir what good is it that's right it's
[41:41] good for everybody house maybe yes but
[41:44] if we can't believe it for
[41:45] ourselves amen and say well Lord I need
[41:50] that that's right I need so we go
[41:52] through serieses and things to show that
[41:55] we need it because of this this because
[41:56] of that you know we done this we done
[41:58] that in our lives to bring us to a place
[42:04] of understanding
[42:07] yes but yet somewhere it's got to become
[42:10] a reality amen right that's right sir
[42:14] and see as I said about Martin Luther it
[42:16] was revealed to
[42:18] him that the J shall live by
[42:22] faith you realize he knew that he would
[42:24] be automatically be ex
[42:26] communicated and in the Catholicism to
[42:29] be excommunicated is to be lost and die
[42:31] and go to hell not to just go to the
[42:33] Purgatory that the pope goes to and has
[42:36] to make his Whistle Stop and can come
[42:38] out the other end right Martin L Luther
[42:42] knew that if he was excommunicated they
[42:44] couldn't pray him out of hell that there
[42:46] wasn't enough money in the world to buy
[42:47] him out of it because it'd be contrary
[42:50] to the
[42:53] Catholicism and see when are we going to
[42:55] put our whole lives on something that's
[42:59] right oh brother D I've got my whole
[43:01] life in this message I I believe
[43:05] it well why do we still have our little
[43:08] thoughts and little ideas though that's
[43:10] right of some reason why yes well I've
[43:15] been a good person there's a lady down
[43:16] here on the side of the road going down
[43:18] on
[43:19] 51 uh we were talking to her one day and
[43:22] she said that preachers and everybody
[43:25] said she is going to go to
[43:28] heaven cuz she'd been good to
[43:31] people
[43:33] well and you think you could convince
[43:35] her that she wasn't going I think by now
[43:38] she's done deding went on I'm not
[43:39] certain but you
[43:42] know but you know she
[43:45] was well I've been
[43:47] good well that's
[43:51] wonderful but if you're not born again
[43:54] what good is your being good that's
[43:56] right that's a good neighbor it's a good
[43:58] person but you see then I make
[44:01] statements and people brother Dale you
[44:04] you're putting me to a position that I
[44:06] know I'm going to
[44:07] die if you are believing that you are
[44:10] going to die and go by the
[44:13] grave I'm trying to preach the truth
[44:17] that can set us
[44:19] free all right that's right but if we
[44:22] will not accept that okay and because of
[44:26] some statement somebody
[44:28] makes you will then become
[44:32] condemned well there was something wrong
[44:36] with your believing before I said that
[44:38] that's right I just exposed it that's
[44:42] right you've got to believe that you're
[44:44] free amen amen you got to believe that
[44:48] you're born again
[44:51] amen not that I'm born again not that
[44:54] brother random was born again amen you
[44:56] got to believe that you're born again
[44:58] that's
[44:59] right you got to believe the son has set
[45:02] you free that's right all right now so
[45:07] is it with the fact of this
[45:10] old second husband or second wife or
[45:13] whatever you do when you get into the
[45:15] marri marriage in the divorce
[45:18] situation and a lot of people will tell
[45:20] you bless God I'll show you that I've
[45:22] never been married
[45:24] before
[45:26] but was they ever
[45:30] engaged if there was is
[45:33] married would you see
[45:37] then all right my point
[45:42] is this flesh has us bound yes now what
[45:46] I mean by that
[45:48] is is long as we're in this
[45:52] flesh Paul says this flesh is carnal
[45:56] that's right sold under
[45:59] sin all right now how else can you say
[46:03] it the flesh without the spirit is dead
[46:06] we know that so it's really the spirit
[46:09] man right that's inside of us is our
[46:12] problem that's
[46:14] right that Soul can be totally perfectly
[46:17] pure by the new birth that's right and
[46:21] yet Satan still has an inroad into our
[46:23] spirit yes that's right right amen there
[46:27] is where our trouble is at is the spirit
[46:29] and the and the body is a display that's
[46:32] right right it makes
[46:35] manifest now let me make sure that that
[46:38] you understand what I said a minute ago
[46:40] cuz sometimes I say something and drop
[46:42] off and don't get it I have never
[46:47] said that it was impossible for you to
[46:50] go if you go by the grave because of a
[46:52] marital situation to not be in the bride
[46:54] of Christ I have never taught no such
[46:57] thing that's
[46:59] right I have never taught that you
[47:02] wouldn't raise in the
[47:04] resurrection and going in Rapture right
[47:07] what I've always said was that our
[47:11] our part that binds us to this
[47:14] earth if it's not set free by the word
[47:17] of God that's right the change in the
[47:20] moment the twinkle of an
[47:23] eye is
[47:26] not going to be done by us if we have a
[47:30] problem so we got to find a way
[47:35] yes to get that set free that's right he
[47:39] that knows the
[47:40] truth see the truth will set you free
[47:43] that's right amen well just don't tell
[47:45] me about it brother D don't know it well
[47:47] then you're not free that's right that's
[47:49] right right I mean you're not free
[47:53] you're saying I don't want to be free M
[47:56] but really what you're saying is you
[47:57] don't want to face reality you know of
[47:59] life like it is but we can't be free
[48:02] without the word why do you think it's
[48:03] message came right right amen that's
[48:08] right or it come to set you and I
[48:13] free and then if you you'll understand
[48:16] and keep reading invisible Union you'll
[48:18] go through that invisible Union book
[48:20] seeing that new birth
[48:23] yes and how that new birth makes makes
[48:25] you perfectly totally free makes you
[48:29] Justified yes
[48:32] amen which starts off saying you done it
[48:36] then you're forgiven that's
[48:38] right then it's as though you never done
[48:41] it
[48:44] right and then it's you never done it
[48:47] that's right now you got to the place
[48:50] yet to be able to say I never done
[48:52] it when everybody in the world knows you
[48:56] did that's
[48:57] right and you better believe the devil
[49:00] ain't gonna never let up on you telling
[49:02] you about how you done
[49:04] it that's right but what about a person
[49:07] that's what I was trying to get at to
[49:09] last message what about a person
[49:11] standing there with that new birth and
[49:15] that
[49:17] soul and that person is perfectly
[49:20] totally
[49:21] free
[49:23] Eternal but yet every nobody else knows
[49:26] what he's done but God don't know what
[49:28] he done that's right amen cuz God put it
[49:31] in his sea of
[49:32] forgetfulness amen amen he rised out
[49:36] your old
[49:38] record totally annihilated the record
[49:42] amen then to prove what he done he
[49:45] transferred your name that's
[49:48] right you remember that yes from The
[49:52] Book of Records that's right into the
[49:55] eternal life
[49:57] section all
[49:59] right and then when you see it that way
[50:01] you see that eternal life section was
[50:04] written before the
[50:05] world the Earthly life wasn't written
[50:08] before the
[50:14] world that wasn't written before the
[50:17] world but to eternal life was written
[50:21] there all right and until we're born
[50:24] again we have nothing to do with that
[50:27] eternal life section amen right
[50:31] right see because we don't even know
[50:33] about it that's right that's right amen
[50:36] right but see the new birth then can
[50:40] make us free amen amen all
[50:44] right but what I've tried to explain and
[50:47] I
[50:48] know some believe that well the new
[50:51] birth sets me
[50:52] free only in Soul amen that's right amen
[50:57] that's right yes sir and to prove that
[51:00] point I wrote a note for
[51:02] myself uh do you believe in asking the
[51:05] Lord to forgive
[51:07] you I mean after you're born
[51:11] again you know after you're born again
[51:15] do you ever ask the Lord to forgive
[51:19] you well if your soul set
[51:24] free
[51:26] why you asking him to forgive
[51:31] you because everybody around you knows
[51:34] you're
[51:35] guilty and you do
[51:38] too right I don't repent for what
[51:41] brother collie
[51:44] does he got to take care of his own part
[51:48] I repent for what I
[51:51] do all right see then that new birth
[51:55] doesn't do and that's what the point I
[51:57] want you to get for a little while and
[51:59] if we have to we'll pick this up
[52:01] Wednesday on a fman on it
[52:04] but the point I want you to see
[52:08] is if the new virus sets you
[52:11] free why did the prophet have to preach
[52:13] marriage and divorce
[52:16] amen right there was no need of
[52:18] preaching
[52:19] it he just tell you the new birth set
[52:22] you
[52:23] free but see the new birth only set the
[52:26] soul free amen
[52:30] right right that's
[52:33] right we get a new spirit yes but that's
[52:37] not taking your spirit out and putting
[52:39] another spirit in there that's
[52:42] right right it's just working on that
[52:45] thing
[52:48] amen and see in doing that then we're
[52:51] supposed to be controlled from the
[52:53] inside
[52:54] out
[52:57] so inside you're perfectly totally free
[53:02] amen but yet that's only part of the
[53:05] Plan of Redemption
[53:09] right so well I if I'm redeemed I'm
[53:12] redeemed well
[53:15] now all I want is scripture for it
[53:18] that's
[53:19] right you if the new birth set you free
[53:23] of your imin divorce
[53:26] and some of you heard it
[53:33] talk all right no
[53:36] problem it's just the fact that I just
[53:38] tell you I don't agree with it right all
[53:44] right but see we only
[53:47] get when we're borned
[53:50] again the new birth is only the earnest
[53:55] of of your inheritance right sir amen we
[54:00] don't call my new bir no Earnest well
[54:01] let's let the Bible call it that go
[54:03] ahead start brother ever who's on the
[54:06] stand today pull up number one which is
[54:09] Ephesians
[54:10] 1 yes sir
[54:13] 13:14 huh in whom you trusted after you
[54:16] heard the word of Truth The Gospel of
[54:19] your salvation in whom also after that
[54:21] you believed you were sealed with the
[54:23] Holy Spirit of promise right now what is
[54:25] the holy spirit of Promise which is the
[54:28] earnest of our inheritance
[54:30] what until the Redemption of the
[54:33] purchased possession unto the praise of
[54:36] his glory right Jesus Christ paid for it
[54:39] that Calvary it's all
[54:42] done that's what your preachers preach
[54:44] right it's a good
[54:47] point but you know the Jews was redeemed
[54:51] at
[54:52] Calvary are they saved
[54:57] no he's not dealing with them that's
[55:00] right so then the Plan of Redemption is
[55:03] not complete that's right and one reason
[55:07] I know it's not I I'm looking at it and
[55:08] you're looking at it meaning us right
[55:12] right as long as we can see us you know
[55:15] that's right the Plan of Redemption is
[55:17] not
[55:18] finished that's why there had to be the
[55:21] seals to be brought to bring us the
[55:24] complete plan of Redemption
[55:26] right that even in the disciples the
[55:30] earnest of your inheritance is the new
[55:32] birth which is Faith right and they
[55:34] taught ver we need virtue knowledge
[55:36] Temperance fa godl brotherly kindness
[55:38] and holy spirit they taught it and
[55:40] that's what we need that's right all
[55:43] right now the new birth at the bottom of
[55:47] the pyramid is the
[55:49] earnest right that's right the new birth
[55:52] as the disciples had
[55:54] it
[55:55] was a fulfillment of a lot of things but
[55:58] it was not the ending of all
[56:03] things it was just bringing the person
[56:06] to the position to where we could start
[56:08] dealing with our spirit and body
[56:14] amen why would you need
[56:18] Temperance if everything went out of
[56:21] you and if it went out and you got the
[56:23] Holy Ghost you didn't need because he is
[56:25] the Holy Ghost you didn't need godliness
[56:28] cuz he is
[56:33] godliness but yet if we had what they
[56:36] had
[56:37] there it would still not be the
[56:40] Redemption of the
[56:41] body right this message come to finish
[56:46] the Plan of Redemption that's right
[56:49] amen which would first show us the new
[56:51] birth because it had to we had gotten so
[56:54] far away away from understanding what it
[56:58] was
[57:00] until
[57:03] we you
[57:05] know we thought it was shouting speaking
[57:08] in tongues crying doing this or doing
[57:09] that or whatever you
[57:13] know but see we had to be brought back
[57:16] to the face of the fathers yes that's
[57:20] right and I know that's offensive to
[57:22] people see we must come back to the
[57:25] faith of the fathers before we can even
[57:26] talk about the seals being broke that's
[57:28] right I know I've been offensive to
[57:30] people for making that statement but why
[57:32] not it's the
[57:36] truth I heard that problem first time
[57:38] man I understand all about them
[57:40] themselves
[57:45] yeah course a lot of people thinks he's
[57:47] wrong on all of it anyway
[57:49] so but
[57:52] listen the earnest of
[57:55] something is just a down
[57:58] payment
[58:00] amen you go down and you buy a
[58:03] house you put down the earnest
[58:08] money really all that does is gives you
[58:10] a right to live in it and pay for it
[58:12] that's right I mean just plain right you
[58:14] go buy your car you put down the earnest
[58:18] money you it just means you can park it
[58:21] in your house in the parking lot and
[58:23] make the payments on it if you stop
[58:25] making the payments on it they come and
[58:27] get it so it proves it don't belong to
[58:30] you
[58:33] right but see the
[58:36] earnest let's read a couple of what the
[58:38] prophet has to say on this is to where
[58:41] anybody out there that hasn't don't know
[58:43] it you'll know the prophet taught these
[58:45] things this is a message Called Moses
[58:47] preached in
[58:50] 1950
[58:52] 110 e29
[58:56] he's talking about how he died for the
[58:58] purpose you know it's in the Plan of
[59:00] Redemption you were
[59:02] redeemed you're when you get to baptism
[59:05] with the Holy Spirit that's the earnest
[59:07] of your
[59:08] salvation is that right in other words
[59:12] it's a down
[59:14] payment and if it'll make me feel like
[59:16] that as a down payment what would it be
[59:18] see Divine Healing is a down payment or
[59:20] an Earnest of a change of a body right
[59:25] all right see Paul said
[59:30] then that we have the earnest of our
[59:33] inheritance until the
[59:39] what the purchase of the whole thing
[59:42] comes into view in other words a whole
[59:45] plan made manifest that's right all
[59:48] right look at the next
[59:50] one see you because you got an Earnest
[59:53] it doesn't mean you got all of it this
[59:55] is Jehovah Gyra preaching 57 paragraph
[59:58] E7 e67 and the blood of Jesus Christ has
[1:00:02] covered us covered and redeemed you from
[1:00:04] everything that Adam did now you don't
[1:00:07] have it in the
[1:00:08] fullness but you have it as an Earnest
[1:00:11] of your
[1:00:14] salvation what's see then to me now I
[1:00:18] don't care what you think and what you
[1:00:19] believe and how you can scream and
[1:00:21] holler you know it it doesn't impress
[1:00:25] me what impresses me is for you to speak
[1:00:28] to me about the word in the correct
[1:00:31] order see for you to blow up and bless
[1:00:33] God I'll tell you I'm born again why you
[1:00:36] blowing and huffing and
[1:00:38] puffing there something wrong reason you
[1:00:41] are that's right
[1:00:42] amen but you see that new birth you
[1:00:47] receive it doesn't redeem the
[1:00:53] body Jesus Jesus's body came out of this
[1:00:57] earth and the Holy Spirit come down to
[1:01:00] to redeem this Earth and redeem that
[1:01:03] portion he was standing in that's right
[1:01:05] but the the rest of it wasn't
[1:01:08] redeemed there only the portion he was
[1:01:10] living in that's right see then the new
[1:01:14] birth doesn't make your body and spirit
[1:01:16] free that's right it makes your soul
[1:01:19] free well I don't like the way you
[1:01:21] preach cuz you leave me
[1:01:23] bound
[1:01:25] you're only Bound by your own thinking
[1:01:27] that's
[1:01:31] right see then let's look at another
[1:01:33] scripture number four there brother
[1:01:35] while we at 1
[1:01:36] Corinthians 6:18 I know I've got into
[1:01:39] trouble with this scripture but I still
[1:01:41] believe
[1:01:42] it I've had people to not want to take
[1:01:47] what is literally
[1:01:49] said Paul says flee
[1:01:53] fornication every sin that a man doeth
[1:01:56] is without the
[1:02:01] body but he that committed fornication
[1:02:04] sinth against his own
[1:02:09] body that's why if you you do something
[1:02:12] wrong between husband and wife you got
[1:02:14] to correct that cuz that's your
[1:02:19] body and see you sinned against your own
[1:02:21] body that's your body that's why you got
[1:02:23] to keep those things straight between
[1:02:24] husband and wife but look what it's
[1:02:27] saying every sin that a man doeth is
[1:02:30] without the body but he that committed
[1:02:32] fornication sinth against his own
[1:02:36] body see fornication is done by the
[1:02:41] body caused by the spirit of
[1:02:46] motivation right motivates it makes it
[1:02:48] do that's
[1:02:50] right that's why it's dire because now
[1:02:54] if we believe the
[1:02:56] Bible and believe the
[1:03:00] prophet see we can go into John yes
[1:03:03] we've been through that we' went through
[1:03:04] that and organized religion
[1:03:07] right the Bible says there in the John
[1:03:10] that he that is born of God does not
[1:03:13] commit
[1:03:17] sin and see we'd argue over what that
[1:03:19] commit means and you know practice it
[1:03:22] and do it you know we didn't keep on
[1:03:24] doing it and we just you
[1:03:27] know but you know that's why I love the
[1:03:29] way brother Brandon
[1:03:32] preached because he was honest enough to
[1:03:35] tell us that he was a sinner
[1:03:38] right and he had to
[1:03:43] repent get them big old theologians to
[1:03:46] admit that no they got their words right
[1:03:48] you know I just don't commit
[1:03:53] it
[1:03:57] well do you do
[1:03:58] it have you done it no no I I didn't do
[1:04:02] it well who done it
[1:04:04] then you know that would be like telling
[1:04:06] the judge your honor I didn't steal
[1:04:09] that set on a case in gains one time
[1:04:12] where I wouldn't on it sit and waiting
[1:04:13] on the other and this man said I didn't
[1:04:16] steal that car car your
[1:04:18] honor he said I just woke up and it was
[1:04:22] parked in my driveway
[1:04:28] and the guy said well what' you do he
[1:04:30] said I got in it and drove it downtown
[1:04:33] to try to find who it belonged
[1:04:36] to well that didn't work too good with a
[1:04:41] jury but you see that's the way we want
[1:04:43] to do
[1:04:44] it we get
[1:04:46] caught you know it's not a sin until you
[1:04:50] get caught is that the way we believe it
[1:04:53] you know is hidden until
[1:04:56] then but what about a prophet that would
[1:04:58] say we sin
[1:05:01] daily now I've had this discussion with
[1:05:04] people do we sin as a
[1:05:08] unit I'm born again Christian
[1:05:10] now a natural sinner with sin is a unit
[1:05:13] right Body Spirit and soul unit Body
[1:05:16] Spirit soul is all sin all right but
[1:05:19] when you're born again you're born again
[1:05:21] in your soul that's right right right so
[1:05:23] you can't sin anymore from th so who's
[1:05:26] the
[1:05:27] sinner who was the guy the prophet was
[1:05:30] saying we sin every day it's got to be
[1:05:33] the body and spirit of the person but if
[1:05:36] it's the soul doing it you're lost
[1:05:38] that's right all right that's the way
[1:05:41] the prophet's message divides things
[1:05:44] thank you Jesus the opening of the word
[1:05:46] right all right so then what I need to
[1:05:49] deal with on
[1:05:51] Redemption you know what do I need to
[1:05:53] deal with with on
[1:05:56] Redemption if my soul is eternal that's
[1:05:59] right what do I need to deal
[1:06:03] with I need to deal with this body and
[1:06:06] spirit man that's right right that's
[1:06:09] right and see that way then I've got to
[1:06:12] get that set
[1:06:14] free and if that man does something
[1:06:17] wrong you better repent because if you
[1:06:19] don't that's
[1:06:21] right the Bible says we're going to give
[1:06:23] a answer of the Deeds that are done
[1:06:25] that's right as a Christian that's right
[1:06:29] amen if we don't clean it up here we're
[1:06:31] going to face it somewhere else amen
[1:06:36] well see then it's not the soul that
[1:06:40] sinth that's what John says his seed
[1:06:44] remaineth in it and that seed of eternal
[1:06:46] life can't sin right that new birth
[1:06:50] can't sin
[1:06:53] right see that Soul can't sin
[1:06:57] right but I have to keep under
[1:06:59] subjection as Paul said my spirit and my
[1:07:03] body all right now then it was my body
[1:07:07] as we've just read that committed
[1:07:10] fornication cuz that's the part that
[1:07:12] does it that's right is the
[1:07:15] body motivated by the
[1:07:19] spirit you so well Born Again Christians
[1:07:22] can't do that well why did brother
[1:07:24] Brandon preached marriage and divorce
[1:07:26] right right he said true
[1:07:29] Christians married three or four
[1:07:32] times why right he said because of
[1:07:36] misinterpreted theology that's
[1:07:41] right because it wasn't
[1:07:45] taught we wasn't told not to do this or
[1:07:48] not do that I well remember in the days
[1:07:51] when we was told not to do a lot of time
[1:07:54] but they still couldn't get it I
[1:07:56] remember in the Baptist when a Baptist
[1:07:58] preacher if he had two wives he didn't
[1:08:00] preach in the Baptist
[1:08:02] Church right some of you remember that
[1:08:04] from the churches you was in then they
[1:08:07] started you know bringing them in
[1:08:10] breaking it down they didn't let them
[1:08:13] preach now they didn't know much about
[1:08:16] you know um engagements being weddings
[1:08:19] or something you know but yet they were
[1:08:21] straight enough to keep some things in
[1:08:25] line and his brother R said if it's good
[1:08:28] enough for Mom and Dad I think it's good
[1:08:29] enough for me and you you know if it's
[1:08:32] good enough to try to keep it in line
[1:08:33] there I think it's good enough to try to
[1:08:34] keep it
[1:08:36] now right but see why do we need the
[1:08:39] grace of marriage and
[1:08:41] divorce if everything went out at the
[1:08:43] new
[1:08:46] birth you see that's misinterpreted
[1:08:49] theology that's
[1:08:51] right that's someone's IDE
[1:08:55] idea that can't be proved by the word
[1:08:58] that's right all
[1:09:05] right brother Brandon said what we
[1:09:08] do invisible Union you remember reading
[1:09:11] this
[1:09:12] one he said we disassociate
[1:09:18] ourselves he said that's what mankind
[1:09:21] has done you can pull that up if you
[1:09:22] want to that's number
[1:09:25] 8 seven excuse me number seven we
[1:09:28] disassociate
[1:09:30] ourselves and we separate people that's
[1:09:35] right the marriage and divorce is the
[1:09:37] biggest separation that there is in the
[1:09:40] world you know because people have their
[1:09:43] ways of thinking their ideas and there
[1:09:45] so much even into this message even
[1:09:47] after the prophet taught
[1:09:50] it and he says we disassociate ourselves
[1:09:56] we separate people what are you
[1:09:58] separating them
[1:10:02] from come on what's he talking about
[1:10:05] what are you separating people from the
[1:10:07] revealed word I don't go for Lula
[1:10:10] brother Dale just an
[1:10:14] intellectual we think he's a fine
[1:10:16] brother he's a good guy and all I that
[1:10:17] but you you just can't understand him
[1:10:19] cuz he's an
[1:10:21] intellectual see that's all
[1:10:26] takes
[1:10:28] right now you say but brother
[1:10:31] Dale now watch this one we disassociate
[1:10:34] people from the word amen or we separate
[1:10:39] them and see we'd say but but I never
[1:10:42] you know I never heard nothing like this
[1:10:44] taught on until I come to
[1:10:48] Lula you know about marriage and
[1:10:52] divorce well that's what I'm talking
[1:10:56] about that's why we that's how we've
[1:10:58] been
[1:10:59] disassociated because we haven't been
[1:11:01] told the truth that's right amen right
[1:11:07] right we had
[1:11:10] no problems because it had not been
[1:11:13] exposed it's kind of like Jesus with the
[1:11:15] Pharisees when he said if I had spoke to
[1:11:18] you you had a cloak but he said now that
[1:11:20] I spoke you don't have any covering
[1:11:22] right you've heard brother and say well
[1:11:24] I didn't know that he said you know it
[1:11:28] now see we disassociate
[1:11:31] ourselves from the word through our
[1:11:34] Traditions our
[1:11:36] denominations right it separated us from
[1:11:38] the word of God
[1:11:41] Amen but I never heard none of them
[1:11:43] teach on it that is what I'm talking
[1:11:47] about
[1:11:49] right that's the problem right we have
[1:11:53] been pushed so far away from the reveal
[1:11:55] word
[1:11:58] right until it's hard to even talk to
[1:12:00] people about it
[1:12:03] because the way the mindset
[1:12:09] is see like I was talking about
[1:12:13] Wednesday that old husband around and
[1:12:15] saids got to be dead that's
[1:12:19] right what do you mean Brother D I just
[1:12:22] believed
[1:12:24] and and I think I can just stay right
[1:12:26] here in my church I can serve God here I
[1:12:29] know that you've told us this was
[1:12:31] denominationalism is wrong but said see
[1:12:34] I've had people to talk talk to me like
[1:12:37] that I I'll stay there and see if I can
[1:12:39] lead them to the
[1:12:41] Lord and then they'll throw it back in
[1:12:43] your face see oh didn't you do that yeah
[1:12:46] I did too cuz I just like the rest of us
[1:12:49] I just like all of us I thought I could
[1:12:52] win the church over
[1:12:54] you know that Martin Luther did not want
[1:12:56] to leave the Catholic church that's his
[1:12:58] own writings he wanted to convert the
[1:13:06] church
[1:13:07] y the Bible says they'll take your words
[1:13:09] and ring you with
[1:13:12] it people can remember
[1:13:15] good but now
[1:13:18] listen if in the marriage and if in the
[1:13:21] new
[1:13:22] birth
[1:13:25] that old husband must be dead right to
[1:13:28] be married to Christ that's
[1:13:32] right well then can't you see in the
[1:13:34] marriage and divorce situation the
[1:13:36] natural you know the literal what you
[1:13:38] want to call it the things of
[1:13:41] life if that's not
[1:13:45] dead then we're going to have to face it
[1:13:52] somewhere
[1:13:56] see right
[1:13:59] amen well don't matter me as long as I
[1:14:02] get to
[1:14:04] heaven that's that's good
[1:14:07] thinking but I thought Paul said if you
[1:14:10] were striving for the Mastery or what is
[1:14:12] that word you know strive for the best
[1:14:16] that's right right that's right why you
[1:14:20] want to settle by going by the grave
[1:14:22] right right
[1:14:25] when you can believe God and stand there
[1:14:26] and be changed in a moment the twinkl of
[1:14:28] an ey if you can believe it right
[1:14:35] amen see some people you know in our
[1:14:38] doings we done a lot of things while we
[1:14:40] were in in the
[1:14:46] world you know and that binds us to a
[1:14:50] position or a place or a
[1:14:52] problem
[1:14:55] and then we find a
[1:14:59] message that can set us free that's
[1:15:03] right now I'm going to put it here and
[1:15:04] then I'll keep on I'll try to preach on
[1:15:06] it if I don't get there we'll cover up
[1:15:08] to
[1:15:09] it I believe just like the new
[1:15:13] birth that the grace of almighty God
[1:15:17] come down and set that Soul perfectly
[1:15:21] totally free from all
[1:15:23] sin made it Eternal just as Eternal as
[1:15:26] God is because he got God's own
[1:15:30] life and just as Justified as God is
[1:15:33] amen
[1:15:36] amen and you remember justified in The
[1:15:39] Invisible
[1:15:41] Union do you never done it that's right
[1:15:46] now that was in God's
[1:15:48] book that was recorded that we done
[1:15:52] it
[1:15:53] but then the lounge book of life
[1:15:56] is when your name's
[1:16:01] transferred and see to do that your old
[1:16:03] husband's got to be
[1:16:05] dead all
[1:16:07] right now the only way in the marriage
[1:16:11] and divorce situation if you got one is
[1:16:14] that that partner husband or wife cuz we
[1:16:17] dealing
[1:16:19] boys that person you were married to
[1:16:22] before
[1:16:24] Paul says if they're
[1:16:26] dead you're
[1:16:30] free and Corinthians says you're
[1:16:33] free to marry only in the Lord you know
[1:16:36] cuz you can't go out and jump and do
[1:16:38] problem but if the husband Paul said is
[1:16:41] dead the woman's free to marry
[1:16:46] again but if he's still alive you got
[1:16:49] two husbands or two wives cuz we're
[1:16:51] covering it both ways cuz we're getting
[1:16:53] into the marriage and divorce
[1:16:57] situation
[1:17:00] right and see then in indivisual Union
[1:17:02] he said you can be
[1:17:08] forgiven a woman you know whatever a man
[1:17:12] you can be
[1:17:13] forgiven but said you can never be
[1:17:15] justified right CU you done
[1:17:21] it now as I said moment ago you
[1:17:24] know you know that people you do you
[1:17:27] think this way I hope you consider my
[1:17:31] point people would tell you with those
[1:17:34] people L they're good
[1:17:36] people but we just don't believe like
[1:17:38] they believe they believe a prophet Etc
[1:17:40] you know but they're good people they
[1:17:42] say
[1:17:45] that but they say well there ain't no
[1:17:47] different than we
[1:17:52] are
[1:17:53] you say well the people at Lula's born
[1:17:56] again but they're not now go convince
[1:17:59] them of
[1:18:02] that I'm having trouble at Lula
[1:18:04] convincing some people that they're not
[1:18:05] born again amen that's
[1:18:08] right you say you talking about me why
[1:18:12] you asking the question don't raise your
[1:18:13] hand if you don't want you
[1:18:17] know brother Mo sitting there in the
[1:18:19] military he said they'd be crawling out
[1:18:20] through there firing over the top of
[1:18:22] them long you don't raise your head
[1:18:24] up you don't get shot
[1:18:27] right not my fault you jump
[1:18:30] up right right but now think about
[1:18:37] it the people around
[1:18:40] you see you as no different than they
[1:18:43] are that's right you know what I mean
[1:18:45] they they know you hire you dress you
[1:18:46] close and we're fanatical and we believe
[1:18:48] a prophet came Etc but in finality they
[1:18:52] look at you just like like that well
[1:18:53] you're Christians just like we
[1:18:58] are right right and they don't see that
[1:19:01] you have the new
[1:19:03] birth cuz they believe they do
[1:19:09] too and the thing of what I'm getting at
[1:19:12] they can
[1:19:13] always say you remember when you say
[1:19:17] well brothers or something I I'm in the
[1:19:20] Lord I'm perfect you remember what you
[1:19:23] used to
[1:19:25] do you remember when you went over to
[1:19:28] you know what you
[1:19:30] done a can still remember
[1:19:33] it but what about a god it can't that's
[1:19:35] right amen
[1:19:39] right I've always believed it I always
[1:19:42] said try to explain it if you do wrong
[1:19:45] and you say well Lord I'm sorry he puts
[1:19:48] that in to see if his forgetfulness
[1:19:50] he'll never remind you of that that's
[1:19:52] right so if something keeps reminding
[1:19:54] you of things you
[1:19:58] done you ought to remember it's not the
[1:20:01] Lord that's right amen right that's
[1:20:04] right you to remember it's the devil
[1:20:06] reminding you that's right amen cu the
[1:20:09] Lord says I don't see
[1:20:12] it when I get up into the marital
[1:20:15] situation of life you know of doing
[1:20:17] wrong and married two or three times or
[1:20:20] whatever you see one the prophet said
[1:20:23] you can be forgiven but never Justified
[1:20:25] because they're going to tell you
[1:20:27] they're going to remember you go down to
[1:20:28] the courthouse there's two records down
[1:20:30] there we remember when you got married
[1:20:33] we know you've been married to this
[1:20:34] woman you've been married to that
[1:20:37] woman but my point today if you don't
[1:20:39] get nothing
[1:20:41] else I believe that's what's holding off
[1:20:44] the Rapture the change
[1:20:48] amen is the fact that we are listening
[1:20:51] to what they say about us our memory
[1:20:55] reason conscience affections Etc is
[1:20:58] remembering all of those things that we
[1:21:00] done that's right and we're not dealing
[1:21:03] with trying to say
[1:21:07] Lord Set Me Free that's
[1:21:13] right that's why I've always said you
[1:21:16] know we pick on the women all the time
[1:21:18] we preach against the girls all the time
[1:21:20] we don't preach against the boys you
[1:21:22] know better than that here Paul says a
[1:21:25] man's got a virginity just as well as a
[1:21:27] woman's got a
[1:21:29] virginity and he'll answer for that
[1:21:32] right we think it's okay for the boy to
[1:21:34] go do it the prophet said he could but
[1:21:36] she can't what did he say he
[1:21:43] could I spent whole services on one
[1:21:46] thing he can put her away but she can't
[1:21:50] put him away right how was it he could
[1:21:54] put her
[1:21:56] away only one
[1:22:00] way and marry again and be right there
[1:22:04] was only one way that's
[1:22:09] right and that was the Matthew that we
[1:22:13] read put away his wife except it be for
[1:22:16] fornication and marry another amen so
[1:22:19] everybody said well it's the prophet
[1:22:21] said he can he can't but do it for that
[1:22:24] one thing now I want that in the
[1:22:26] scriptures and I want in the prophet's
[1:22:28] message to show me where you can put
[1:22:29] them away for man can put away his wife
[1:22:32] for any other
[1:22:36] reason that goes on internet that's open
[1:22:39] to the
[1:22:42] world well see we just quote that for
[1:22:46] what do you mean I know I done this but
[1:22:47] he said we could but you
[1:22:50] can't don't work
[1:22:54] I'm
[1:22:56] sorry but
[1:22:58] listen compare the new
[1:23:03] birth as the grace that is given unto
[1:23:07] you and I that's
[1:23:10] right come
[1:23:12] on are are are we saved by grace through
[1:23:17] faith yes we're not saved through faith
[1:23:21] we're saved by Grace right through faith
[1:23:24] amen
[1:23:27] amen
[1:23:29] now comparing that new birth saved by
[1:23:32] grace through faith and going through
[1:23:34] what we went they brother R said God let
[1:23:37] that old husband die
[1:23:41] right see because we can't kill him
[1:23:44] that's
[1:23:45] right we try to kill him it just means a
[1:23:49] divorce I mean really is that truthfully
[1:23:52] we try to do it it's just he'll jump
[1:23:54] right back
[1:23:55] up but he let it
[1:24:00] die now some were then with a marital
[1:24:05] problem you married before whatever
[1:24:11] now if we can compare that with a new
[1:24:15] birth then we've got to realize
[1:24:17] somewhere that God let that old wife or
[1:24:21] husband right die
[1:24:28] yes and they're still
[1:24:33] living right are you with me
[1:24:38] yes now when you was born
[1:24:40] again he let that old husband die right
[1:24:44] that nature yes did that stop the world
[1:24:47] from having that
[1:24:49] nature did that stop the neighbor or did
[1:24:52] it stop your wife if you got born again
[1:24:54] did that stop your wife from having that
[1:24:56] nature no did it stop the kids from
[1:24:59] having it did it stop anybody else from
[1:25:02] having that nature besides you that's
[1:25:06] right so as I said a moment ago they can
[1:25:08] still remember all we do and so can we
[1:25:11] and so will the devil keep reminding you
[1:25:13] what you do amen amen but see I believe
[1:25:16] somebody's going to come under the grace
[1:25:18] of marriage and divorce that they're
[1:25:20] going to see grace that's right
[1:25:25] and there truly going to be Grace Grace
[1:25:27] as we read in Zechariah that's
[1:25:30] right that we can be totally free and
[1:25:33] that old husband that old wife just
[1:25:36] paraphrasing the point for marriage and
[1:25:39] divorce is so dead until God don't count
[1:25:42] it no
[1:25:46] more and yet they're living next door to
[1:25:49] you or something you
[1:25:51] know
[1:25:52] you know what it
[1:25:54] means they're still alive they're still
[1:25:57] out there doing they're still going
[1:25:59] right and they're still saying that was
[1:26:01] my wife at one time or that was my
[1:26:04] husband you
[1:26:10] know we're going to have to get to the
[1:26:12] place that we can say that God says he's
[1:26:15] dead cuz he said he's dead that's right
[1:26:18] amen that's right or she's dead whether
[1:26:21] it be man or woman whatever that's right
[1:26:24] if we can't realize that then we're not
[1:26:25] free that's
[1:26:29] right you mean God let all of them old
[1:26:32] things that I
[1:26:34] done he let that die yes
[1:26:40] yes
[1:26:42] yes cuz he's the only one that could
[1:26:45] that's right
[1:26:48] amen and see being the only one that
[1:26:51] could do it then he's got to let
[1:26:54] this of the grace of marriage and
[1:26:56] divorce let it be to the basis that he
[1:26:58] can let it die that's
[1:27:01] right well I just don't see how that can
[1:27:03] be done within you can't never be set
[1:27:05] free that's right
[1:27:09] amen and if you can't believe it's for
[1:27:12] you it's not that's
[1:27:18] right if you believe it's for others yes
[1:27:21] yes yeah don't do you a bit of
[1:27:23] good you believe it's for you that's
[1:27:27] right yeah but look what I
[1:27:30] done as I've always
[1:27:33] said I've never read anywhere that a
[1:27:35] marital situation was blaspheming was
[1:27:38] blaspheming the Holy
[1:27:41] Ghost have
[1:27:46] you but if we don't accept it because of
[1:27:50] some idea that man has put in our head
[1:27:53] that's right right then we're cutting
[1:27:56] our own selves
[1:27:58] off amen we're refusing to accept God's
[1:28:02] grace that's right that's the same as a
[1:28:05] man with a pardon without a pardon
[1:28:06] that's right amen it's not one unless
[1:28:08] it's received as a pardon that's
[1:28:12] right it's no good that's
[1:28:15] right see to compare the things of the
[1:28:18] new
[1:28:19] birth and compare it with marital
[1:28:23] lives we can look and see there's a
[1:28:31] possibility there's a possibility that's
[1:28:34] right see the new birth is the
[1:28:37] foundation right for coming to the
[1:28:40] understanding that's
[1:28:43] right and that brings a
[1:28:47] possibility to where we could be set
[1:28:49] free right right
[1:28:56] amen see the only way you can get the
[1:28:59] new birth is for that old
[1:29:01] husband to
[1:29:07] die see then there's the only way to be
[1:29:09] set from free from husband wife Etc
[1:29:12] situation of marriage and
[1:29:15] divorce is we got to realize that other
[1:29:18] person's dead that's
[1:29:20] right
[1:29:24] now I told you it wouldn't do no good to
[1:29:25] go out and shoot
[1:29:27] him
[1:29:28] right like you murderer a
[1:29:35] problem but what about living next door
[1:29:37] to somebody or something and seeing them
[1:29:40] every day and but yet God can let that
[1:29:50] die now come
[1:29:55] on as I said the other day brother Tom
[1:29:59] was referring to
[1:30:01] it you shave that old
[1:30:06] boy you ladies fix that old fell up all
[1:30:10] the time you
[1:30:14] know
[1:30:18] right you know he's still alive
[1:30:20] everybody in the world knows he's still
[1:30:22] alive God says he's
[1:30:27] dead the problem is we don't say what
[1:30:29] God says that's right that's
[1:30:36] right
[1:30:39] see God is the only one that can let it
[1:30:42] die
[1:30:45] yes and not kill the person that is
[1:30:50] in right that's MH you understand what I
[1:30:54] mean
[1:30:55] yes that husband that wife situation
[1:30:58] walking right on down the
[1:31:00] road and maybe you're even paying child
[1:31:03] support and having to mail it to them or
[1:31:06] or whatever you
[1:31:08] know and yet God can say it's
[1:31:13] gone you so well brother
[1:31:17] Dale it really would be a revelation
[1:31:20] with
[1:31:27] but you see we can't do that by holding
[1:31:29] on to The Telltale parts and signs
[1:31:33] that's
[1:31:35] right you
[1:31:37] know what are you tell me to do not
[1:31:39] speak to that person no
[1:31:41] more a don't be silly that's right I
[1:31:45] hope I'm not that
[1:31:47] carnal I hope you understand what I'm
[1:31:50] talking about if not you're that carnal
[1:31:53] that's right
[1:31:54] amen God let it die that's right God let
[1:31:59] that nature that world die that nature
[1:32:01] of that world is still out here doing
[1:32:03] everything and he's still working
[1:32:04] through my body and my spirit right and
[1:32:07] you may think he's not in yours I just
[1:32:09] tell you up front there's something
[1:32:11] wrong with you that's
[1:32:13] right he's done got you's reason no
[1:32:16] problems with him that's right
[1:32:20] amen all right
[1:32:23] see if God
[1:32:26] says it's
[1:32:33] gone why can't we say it's
[1:32:40] gone Paul
[1:32:43] said I'm
[1:32:47] dead is that right that's
[1:32:50] right
[1:32:52] the life that I now live in the flesh
[1:32:55] okay I live by the faith of the Son of
[1:33:08] God you see
[1:33:10] we we we can't move into receiving our
[1:33:18] freedom you know because there too much
[1:33:26] memory too much of ourselves that's
[1:33:29] involved in the memory phases of our
[1:33:32] life that's
[1:33:34] right and Satan can talk to us in there
[1:33:37] that's
[1:33:38] right but you know he could talk to
[1:33:41] Jesus
[1:33:45] there and
[1:33:48] did but he said just get on behind me
[1:33:52] right
[1:33:56] right brother brandom said the reason we
[1:33:58] can be you've been in invisible Union
[1:34:01] reading
[1:34:03] it he said that old husband's got to be
[1:34:06] dead said we've got to be Washed by the
[1:34:09] Water of the word that's
[1:34:12] right he said not by the water of the
[1:34:15] church now that's right that's
[1:34:17] right he said but Washed by the Water of
[1:34:20] the word yes
[1:34:28] he said then our name has been
[1:34:36] transferred well I don't understand
[1:34:38] brother R said that's where you won't
[1:34:40] understand the two books
[1:34:43] okay he said which is not two books but
[1:34:47] is one book amen and one book leads out
[1:34:51] out to the other one he said so this
[1:34:54] Bible tells of the Apostle
[1:34:57] Paul and how he was killing the
[1:35:01] Christians then it leads
[1:35:04] out to the road to
[1:35:09] Damascus and Paul
[1:35:17] died and he come forth as a born again
[1:35:20] Christian amen mhm so his name was
[1:35:27] transferred he said
[1:35:29] well what other word could you use
[1:35:31] brother Dale to express that
[1:35:34] well and know I know that transferred
[1:35:36] seemed like it's taken out and rubbed
[1:35:38] out put over this
[1:35:40] way why not just take it this
[1:35:45] way there's got to come a time where we
[1:35:47] can look at her old past and her old
[1:35:49] deeds in life
[1:35:52] and realize he gone that's
[1:35:56] right and look into God's word to see
[1:35:59] ourselves that's right as God sees us
[1:36:02] that's
[1:36:05] right he told Israel he said you're the
[1:36:07] apple of my
[1:36:12] eye he told bam when he was trying to
[1:36:15] curse Israel I see no sin
[1:36:19] amen right right
[1:36:23] Bam could say now wait a minute
[1:36:26] Lord the Lord had say bam you don't have
[1:36:29] to explain it to me I know your whole
[1:36:31] story but I don't see them they've got
[1:36:35] the
[1:36:36] atonement right
[1:36:40] amen right
[1:36:44] right but see if we can see that we have
[1:36:48] our life is not just say cut out here
[1:36:50] and put over here transferred why not
[1:36:53] just realize it's written there that's
[1:36:55] right wouldn't that be the best way to
[1:36:56] say it instead of transferring it to
[1:36:58] just come in this life and realize
[1:37:01] that's right by the new birth that my
[1:37:04] name was written in the Lamb's Book of
[1:37:07] Life before the foundation of the
[1:37:11] world
[1:37:13] Amen and I'm now proving it
[1:37:16] yes by the way that I live and the what
[1:37:19] that I do amen
[1:37:21] and F in this
[1:37:25] word see human terminology sometime it's
[1:37:29] confusing to where that it's you
[1:37:35] know and then simple terminology is
[1:37:38] correct and my wife we were talking the
[1:37:40] other day about the
[1:37:42] book and she made a good point she said
[1:37:44] y'all talk about the book said I never
[1:37:45] could realize what the book he talking
[1:37:47] about he said until one day and I hope I
[1:37:50] get the point to correct directly
[1:37:52] worship he said one day I realized
[1:37:57] that Adam didn't have a
[1:38:02] book but he was supposed to brought
[1:38:05] forth the human
[1:38:08] race we said he just didn't do it right
[1:38:11] he brought it forth in sin which started
[1:38:13] the other book to be written you know
[1:38:15] the record right it wouldn't have been
[1:38:18] no
[1:38:20] book
[1:38:23] you know it wouldn't have been a book If
[1:38:25] it hadn't been for sin
[1:38:32] amen see Church do we know and realize
[1:38:35] brother BR says it three times I'm
[1:38:37] pretty
[1:38:38] sure in invisible Union that he said God
[1:38:42] let it die that's right he said them old
[1:38:45] denominations is dead we'll get to that
[1:38:48] one when we get into the to that old
[1:38:51] husband
[1:38:53] am cuz you see what's wrong with us now
[1:38:56] is misinterpreted theology by
[1:38:58] denominationalism that's
[1:39:01] right and it's causing us to not be able
[1:39:04] to be free
[1:39:06] right of what we've been taught amen
[1:39:16] Amen brother randam gets kind of down to
[1:39:18] the end of the invisible Union and he
[1:39:20] says
[1:39:23] to find a place to
[1:39:26] realize that we're dead to them old
[1:39:33] husbands now I'm going to make a
[1:39:35] statement cuz I got to clarify it way on
[1:39:37] down the road but I'll make it
[1:39:40] now I believe it's worse to be married
[1:39:42] to organized
[1:39:46] religion and won't line up you know it
[1:39:48] confess the truth and see it
[1:39:53] and stay in what we've been taught than
[1:39:56] it is to be married a half a dozen times
[1:40:03] literally you might not agree with that
[1:40:05] that's all right that's just
[1:40:08] me that's the way I
[1:40:11] think I don't think brother brandham had
[1:40:13] a maracal problem in his life do you no
[1:40:19] no but I think brother randam was
[1:40:22] married to organized religion just like
[1:40:23] you and I that's
[1:40:25] right that's going to go over
[1:40:33] good you want quotes he said I cared a
[1:40:36] Baptist Bible and converted them to a
[1:40:38] Baptist Faith that's
[1:40:42] right but see that we don't want it that
[1:40:47] way you say Brother D are you saying I'm
[1:40:50] saying in this for later year down the
[1:40:53] road probably about 6 months from now
[1:40:55] one of these days we're going to have to
[1:40:56] realize that marriage and divorce is
[1:40:59] that middle stage you got the new birth
[1:41:01] and then you got the marriage and
[1:41:02] divorce and then you got your law and
[1:41:04] Grace
[1:41:06] okay and that's what's holding us here
[1:41:08] okay that's
[1:41:10] right is what we've been taught that's
[1:41:13] right
[1:41:14] amen he said we're in this problem with
[1:41:17] marriage and divorce because of
[1:41:18] misinterpreted theology okay that's
[1:41:21] right people never taught us it was
[1:41:24] wrong to do these things that's right
[1:41:26] where did you ever hear it Tau it was
[1:41:28] wrong to
[1:41:30] do
[1:41:31] no well they didn't never well that's
[1:41:34] the problem they didn't never teach
[1:41:36] us but I want to go down to number 19
[1:41:39] and we'll just read it it's take on
[1:41:42] Christ revealing his own word if you can
[1:41:44] get down to that one pretty
[1:41:47] fast and just listen to what the prophet
[1:41:49] had to say about marriage and in
[1:41:56] divorce yes Christ revealing his own
[1:41:58] word
[1:42:01] yeah 1965
[1:42:04] 822 and by the way people listening in
[1:42:07] these tapes some are so many sends in
[1:42:11] said why in the Mar in the marriage and
[1:42:13] divorce you said this and you said
[1:42:18] that I said that so many many times
[1:42:21] these
[1:42:22] tapes are only I'm speaking to my
[1:42:25] congregation brother I'm not responsible
[1:42:28] for what God give you to Shepherd I'm
[1:42:30] responsible for what kind of food I feed
[1:42:33] these people this is for this Tabernacle
[1:42:35] only and now if the people want to
[1:42:38] listen to the Tes that's up to them but
[1:42:39] I'm speaking to what God has given me it
[1:42:42] was their sins that was
[1:42:49] omitted that's what they accused him of
[1:42:51] saying
[1:42:53] right and he admits
[1:42:56] it you said no that's just him coming
[1:42:58] down here and coming back to his thought
[1:43:00] and he said it's them saying their sins
[1:43:05] were that's that me that's that
[1:43:10] mind read
[1:43:12] it what
[1:43:15] happened he said people hugging each
[1:43:18] other their sins
[1:43:21] he said this is to my people
[1:43:23] only you get a revelation from God and
[1:43:26] do what you want to what you
[1:43:28] doing he said it was their sins that was
[1:43:32] remitted if you'll read in marriage and
[1:43:34] divorce you'll find brother brand would
[1:43:36] say Moses found his people in that
[1:43:40] condition God granted a right of
[1:43:42] divorcement and counted it
[1:43:47] righteousness he said Paul in his day
[1:43:49] and said would not he come in this last
[1:43:51] days to
[1:43:53] us CU you see I believe that's what's
[1:43:55] binding us to this world Amen is our
[1:43:58] spirit and our body that's right right
[1:44:03] amen because if we're allowing it to
[1:44:05] keep control of us that's
[1:44:10] right as I say and I said to start with
[1:44:13] don't think you'll ever become a
[1:44:15] zombie ain't going to do that going to
[1:44:18] do that no don't look eyes go
[1:44:25] straight
[1:44:27] no won't do no
[1:44:31] good same old brain is thinking going
[1:44:34] that way as it is looking that
[1:44:37] way the best thing to do is just say
[1:44:40] Lord forgive me
[1:44:42] amen that's it Lord forgive
[1:44:46] me help
[1:44:49] me you let that
[1:44:52] die
[1:44:53] sir as you let that nature of the world
[1:44:57] die in my soul but yet I still love to
[1:44:59] hunt and fish
[1:45:01] and
[1:45:04] right I said let that old nature of that
[1:45:07] world die
[1:45:10] right you see Church what I'm trying to
[1:45:13] say is one
[1:45:16] thing there was a lot of people done
[1:45:18] things before they come into the message
[1:45:20] that puts a person in a
[1:45:23] level that gives a understanding or a
[1:45:26] hope there because they didn't know and
[1:45:29] then they can read the marriage and
[1:45:30] divorce and receive what the prophet has
[1:45:32] to
[1:45:34] say some come along later and done
[1:45:36] things after coming into the
[1:45:40] message the in
[1:45:42] problems we see everybody's going to
[1:45:44] have to answer theirselves cuz I don't
[1:45:46] have an answer for
[1:45:48] nobody I have a a thing to let you know
[1:45:52] one thing if God will set you free
[1:45:55] you're
[1:45:56] free you got to talk to him to find out
[1:45:59] if you're free that's right you got to
[1:46:01] discuss it to him with him to see no
[1:46:04] preacher's words can't set you free
[1:46:06] that's
[1:46:10] right well brother brandom told me I was
[1:46:12] okay that's all
[1:46:16] right like people say brother around and
[1:46:18] said he saw me there
[1:46:21] another brother come up you know we're
[1:46:22] all smart in our brains and he come up
[1:46:25] and said he was in hell and he was in
[1:46:26] heaven said now where did he see you
[1:46:29] at and that's
[1:46:34] true but you see Church we've been
[1:46:37] disassociated from the revealed word of
[1:46:39] God by organized religion that's right
[1:46:43] and that's the reason of the married two
[1:46:45] or three times that's
[1:46:49] right
[1:46:50] that's why I tell everybody you go to
[1:46:52] God for that that's right you talk to
[1:46:56] God about your life
[1:47:00] amen I I I can't
[1:47:03] answer questions because I don't know
[1:47:07] brother brandham had the discernment he
[1:47:09] could stand and say why did you leave
[1:47:12] this out of your
[1:47:13] story I don't have
[1:47:16] that so don't come to me and say brother
[1:47:19] Dale do you think I'm free I'm I'm going
[1:47:20] to ask you a simple question do you
[1:47:23] think you're free that's
[1:47:26] right I'm not going to ask you are you
[1:47:28] born
[1:47:35] again you're going to tell me you
[1:47:41] are but I will tell you what we do in
[1:47:44] life
[1:47:47] about the new birth or about marriage
[1:47:49] and divorce will prove prove what we
[1:47:51] are you run off all upset at me because
[1:47:54] of some things that I've said about
[1:47:56] marriage and divorce and things then
[1:47:59] that's your problem that's your that's
[1:48:01] right but you remember one
[1:48:04] thing you're going to be running from
[1:48:07] somebody who tried to tell you the
[1:48:11] truth so then that means you're going to
[1:48:13] be leaving the word and you're going to
[1:48:15] be disassociating yourself from the
[1:48:17] truth
[1:48:19] amen now brother Dale don't talk like
[1:48:21] that a lot of times but I think that
[1:48:22] ought to be said
[1:48:28] yes but you see if you can't believe
[1:48:30] you're free you can't be free
[1:48:37] that's my mama told me I was all
[1:48:43] right I'm sorry my mama wasn't
[1:48:47] God that's right that's right I don't
[1:48:49] think your are either right nor your
[1:48:52] daddy nor your pastor your whatever
[1:48:54] you're talking about that's why I don't
[1:48:56] tell
[1:48:57] nobody you ask me what I think about
[1:49:01] you I'll say well what do you think
[1:49:04] about
[1:49:06] you because it's not what I think it's
[1:49:09] between you and God that's right amen
[1:49:12] the grace of marriage and divorce if you
[1:49:15] will not receive it it is not for
[1:49:19] you
[1:49:21] but if you can receive it it was their
[1:49:24] sins was the last quote it was their
[1:49:28] sins that was remitted
[1:49:34] right see it calvary sin was remitted
[1:49:38] but one day it was applied
[1:49:43] right and then when we can receive it
[1:49:45] and let it be
[1:49:49] applied we can say I'm free
[1:49:56] right well until then what do we
[1:50:00] do I made a statement here a while
[1:50:04] back I only told my wife about
[1:50:09] it I made it
[1:50:13] deliberately brother BR says on marriage
[1:50:15] and divorce go on As You
[1:50:19] Are
[1:50:22] he doesn't say on marriage and divorce
[1:50:24] that I explained all these things he
[1:50:27] didn't explain
[1:50:29] them he just says go on as you
[1:50:34] are God has made a way before like this
[1:50:42] right but see when he comes over here
[1:50:44] and he says it was their sins that was
[1:50:47] remitted when he gets invisible union he
[1:50:49] realiz is what marriage and divorce has
[1:50:57] done and if God can let that old husband
[1:51:00] or that old wife
[1:51:05] die and we can be
[1:51:09] free I ain't never have none of them
[1:51:12] troubles
[1:51:15] sorry praise God there are people like
[1:51:18] that but that's where we we going to
[1:51:20] move up into the law and Grace now and
[1:51:22] we're going to find out that everybody's
[1:51:24] guilty
[1:51:28] right we're going to talk about an
[1:51:30] apostle Paul that was
[1:51:32] guilty and God made
[1:51:34] free we're going to talk about a William
[1:51:37] brandham that was guilty and God made
[1:51:39] him free
[1:51:42] amen and then you're going to realize
[1:51:44] one of these
[1:51:47] days why Hebrews 11:40 says what what it
[1:51:52] says that they without
[1:51:55] us cannot be
[1:51:59] complete God's waiting on somebody that
[1:52:02] can believe what he says I believe
[1:52:10] that I kind of like what one of the
[1:52:12] disciples said one day or something said
[1:52:14] help thou my
[1:52:15] unbelief that's
[1:52:17] right help me Lord you can get enough
[1:52:20] believing in me that I can receive
[1:52:24] it but you got a marital problem you've
[1:52:27] been married twice or this that or the
[1:52:29] other what good does it do to try to go
[1:52:31] back and tear up old records and rip
[1:52:33] them up and do this that or the
[1:52:39] other why don't you just believe what he
[1:52:41] said going as you are that's
[1:52:45] right I didn't mean go home with four
[1:52:48] wives
[1:52:51] uh-uh they went home with the one they
[1:52:55] got you take Paul in his day what about
[1:52:58] a Grace you think a man that was under a
[1:53:01] time of that polygamy was legal with
[1:53:04] Apostle
[1:53:05] Paul in that time it was still
[1:53:08] there and there's Paul talking to a man
[1:53:11] that's got a half a dozen wives what's
[1:53:13] he going to
[1:53:16] do well go home with all your wives and
[1:53:18] have kids and ra no oh no
[1:53:21] no he's born
[1:53:25] again he's got to have the mind of
[1:53:27] Christ that's
[1:53:30] right I told you about it which he told
[1:53:32] it here brother Theo arasmus and them
[1:53:35] when they was in Africa there and those
[1:53:38] people that were living together
[1:53:39] underground and didn't know who was the
[1:53:40] daddy of
[1:53:42] what just living together
[1:53:45] just you know in a communal
[1:53:48] thing
[1:53:50] well they wanted to be Christians and
[1:53:51] they started wanting to receive the Lord
[1:53:53] and getting baptized
[1:53:56] and now what would you do with
[1:54:02] that and I thought that man had
[1:54:08] wisdom he said you get it all
[1:54:10] straightened out and said we come up our
[1:54:12] one day and said
[1:54:15] okay who is your wife well I got three
[1:54:19] of of them no no no no
[1:54:22] no you pick you
[1:54:29] one that's your wife what would you
[1:54:36] do but I put on it a little bit more
[1:54:39] than what they said they done and they
[1:54:40] done that and they just had a communal
[1:54:43] wedding you
[1:54:46] know all of you
[1:54:48] know at a
[1:54:51] wedding I put a little more on that my
[1:54:54] point is Paul what would you do Paul
[1:54:58] says which one is your
[1:55:01] wife that
[1:55:04] one Paul would tell that
[1:55:07] person you're going to feed that other
[1:55:10] family and you going to take care of
[1:55:13] them other
[1:55:15] women if you going to claim to be a
[1:55:18] Christian that's right
[1:55:20] he said well how do you know that well I
[1:55:22] don't know how do you know it ain't
[1:55:25] right what would you
[1:55:27] do I certainly wouldn't tell him to
[1:55:29] throw them all
[1:55:33] out and say you get you a wife and you
[1:55:36] better not flirt with one of them others
[1:55:39] or think about
[1:55:40] it but you going to feed that other ones
[1:55:44] and you're going to feed them kids
[1:55:46] that's true he said you just too tough
[1:55:52] y people don't like my ways of
[1:55:55] doing I'm
[1:55:58] sorry but I think it's pretty good rules
[1:56:01] that's right you know
[1:56:03] right what would you
[1:56:07] do see CU all things has got to be made
[1:56:11] right somewhere that's true and we as
[1:56:13] Christians ought to
[1:56:14] be that's right come on
[1:56:18] Brothers but if you can accept the grace
[1:56:20] of marriage and divorce it's for you if
[1:56:23] you can't it's
[1:56:25] not so it's not whether or not I tell
[1:56:27] you or anybody tells
[1:56:31] you
[1:56:33] right it's whether or
[1:56:37] not you can believe
[1:56:43] it the grace of marriage and
[1:56:46] divorce crying Grace Grace
[1:56:50] why do we not want to be right
[1:56:55] amen and be
[1:57:01] straight but you see we all got that
[1:57:04] little thing you know I get into it when
[1:57:07] I try to explain it but women will say
[1:57:10] well it's just hard living
[1:57:13] alone well Paul said if you just commit
[1:57:16] yourself to the
[1:57:17] Lord that he would take care of of
[1:57:20] everything and you ain't got a husband
[1:57:22] to put up
[1:57:24] with but women will say I just can't
[1:57:27] live alone then they go marry somebody
[1:57:29] and they can't live with
[1:57:36] them it doesn't look sensible does
[1:57:39] it we try to make our own
[1:57:44] ways it always backfires let's
[1:57:47] stand what do we got
[1:58:05] Brothers is
[1:58:07] alive
[1:58:10] God he is
[1:58:13] alive he said what are you talking about

[1:58:18] anybody that doesn't have hope within
[1:58:21] their own

[1:59:21] hand him in my feet and he him in my
[1:59:26] heart and he
[1:59:32] over think about
[1:59:34] it he's made us
[1:59:38] free he's made us
[1:59:43] free more to it than just thinking about
[1:59:45] a new
[1:59:48] birth
[1:59:50] but all of this is just a
[1:59:53] background to talk about law and
