but anyway so this is dedicated to brother Dell and all the Dell family I'll say um from Sister Johnny and uh and this is kind of a testimony song it's U you'll see as as we go through the uh pictures here if they work a picture of YULA at about four years old when she was struggling with seizures and then me with the truck wreck I had around back at that time around 2015 or so uh that I was driving a tractor trailer and somebody pulled out in front of me Point Blank and nobody went to the hospital everybody survived the the lady and the little boy I hit them at 65 miles an hour weighed 85,000 lbs and it wound up everybody was okay and that's a miracle uh the the Kentucky tornadoes that we were in up there a few years ago the tree in our yard that we called Goliath cuz it was threatening to fall in our house I spoke to it said fall the other way Gabby confessed it and it fell the other way away from our house and then of course all the testimony around ia's birth um when she was born with underdeveloped lungs and then of course Ava at four years old also with the seizures she was going through during that time so this song is about God delivering you and being with you when you're in those trials and the D family is in a trial God is with y'all we got a lot of set up I'm sorry a lot of microphones to set up all right that's that's it okay four there's a Grace when the Heart Is Under Fire another way when the walls are closing in and when I look at the space between where I used to be and this Reckoning I know I'll never be alone there was another in the fire standing next to me there was another in the waters holding back the Seas and should I ever n m of how I've been set free there is a cross that bears the bir where another died for me there is

lying you need you just you just made one so everybody can raise their hands down we all make mistakes man week's been kind of rough for me so just pray for us John 1 verse one in the beginning was the word where was with God and the Word was God and that same word was in the beginning with God and we were talking about that uh Wednesday and we'll continue on that a little bit more tonight all things were made by this person and without him was not anything made that was made and the Word was made flesh all come down that great funnel all funnel down into that one man named Jesus Christ and then now through that one man Jesus Christ it's going to start going back to the other direction am man it'll be the expansion of God it'll be God that'll looks like The Hourglass coming down and then all of a sudden all the Sand's going to be down here well that Sand's in the bride all right the Holy Ghost is in the bride and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you can be seated you know we think sometimes we think well I'd have done it different have you ever said that before i' I I just do that different well you don't have to tell God that cuz he don't he can't even do it different right he did it one way he thought of it one way and he thought of it perfect when he thought of it so he doesn't have to have a second thought right and he don't have another thought coming this is his thought that's right and I like what brother um the Alo was talking about he he and I had preached that sermon down to brother Martin's and he had watched it online from from Honduras and about the U eth day and about us being translated I want to read this in Colossians giving thanks unto the Father which has made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints and light who has delivered us from the power of Darkness so he's delivered us from something and hath translated that word translated means to look transfer remove from one place to another all right or of change of situation our place and the Bible tells us in here a few minutes with we where are we sitting tonight if we're born again we're sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus your soul is in another dimension because it's Eternal it's perfect never had a bad day we got to realize that when you receive the new birth that's what you receive you receive God and you become deity just as he is deity but we just get a little portion of it where he's all knowing all powerful the only reason we're not all knowing and all powerful is we have a carnal mind and we have flu and we have that thing called a brain the greatest battle ever fought in what it's in your brain all right it's not your soul unless you're not born again if you're born again that fight's over but we sure have struggle in them other two all right out into our body now listen what Paul says and have translated us into the kingdom now I want to ask you a question is this the kingdom of God at this moment right now is this the kingdom of God no it's the kingdom of the devil this is Satan he's got he's got the he's a squatter he don't have the title but he's a squatter right this is his world to play with started in the Garden of Eden all the way to now amen but we're going to get it back but we're translated out of that as our brother was talking about we we are not in this we are not in this church age now if we were in this church age we'd be blind wretched miserable naked and not know it but since we are a part of the beginning of the creation of God or a continuation of that creation of God we have been translated out of this age all right now listen truly though the seventh Church age the seventh day last all the way to the end of the Millennium now remember that right but eternity has come here now we're not having to wait to Eternity right I listened to several preachers online and not from message preachers but but even the the the brother that was speaking the other Sunday when we went to that uh Baptist Church and and not speaking against them but they can only go so far Jesus is out there Jesus is sure he saved us and sure he John 3:16 us for God shall love the world he gave his only begotten son whosoever believe on him should not perish but have everlasting life but for you but for you to say I am part of Jesus and I am perfect they can't take that they can't take that but you and I it should be a common thing to say that and to be able to believe it not just say it and then what then what do we do the reason that the reason that they show who they are because they don't they still cut their hair they still wear pants they still you know they they good old Baptist he won't drink but he'll chew a little backer and and smoke so Donny knows that but then you got the Presbyterians that Dr so you got all the groups of denominations that there's a part somewhere they can't live the full word of God because they've not been what taught to live the full word of God you and I have been taught to live the full word of God all right and we're struggling and we're heading that way up the statue of perfect man unto Perfection but if you're born again today that thing inside of you is perfect right doesn't have any flaws at all so we got to believe that brother Bob he had translated us he's picked us out of this age because if we stay in this age we get all those damnable things wretched blind miserable naked and don't know it all these different things we've been translated into the kingdom of his dear son to transpose transfer remove from one place to another see the what I see that that the denominations they say well we're going to a place we're going to heaven we're going they don't know the Heaven's come here first that's they don't know that Christ has already come here first he's here in a group of people they can't take that they can take Jesus being their Savior and being on the cross do you understand that and they could be saved fish virsion or or giv eternal life but but to possess eternal life in their soul once you present this message to them they've got to come to it because this message is the soul of God for the end time amen and that's soul of God is transferred into you that way you can say amen back this way cuz there something inside of you Rings true that says that ain't nothing but the truth every service you ought to be like had it right that ain't nothing but the truth that ain't nothing but the truth that ain't nothing but the truth if you hear brother Brandon preach you say that ain't nothing but the truth amen and whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins so watch Paul he put us in heaven yeah I like Paul put us in heaven translated us then he brought us back and said we have sin even the Forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature remember God said you can't see my face you can't see me but I'm going to declare myself through this flesh called Jesus Christ for by him were all things created who who what who was a Creator the Son of God the logos they said let there be all right but that same one that said let there be became became a baby and cried in a Manger 2,000 years ago or we got two different people visible and invisible he created everything that we can see and can't see praise God whether they be Thrones dominions principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him like I said many times before we're either going to Bow and do obedience every day to God that knowing that he's our creator he's our King he's our sustainer or somebody that's never bowed that never going to Bow a knee uh some of the Great Men of the world that that don't care a thing about God they're going to Bow but they're going to have a look on their face a lot different than the look we have on our face as brother Joe kenned was say we need to let our face up we need to worship even if we have to worship with a bigger smile this year than we have before or live give a a a more resounding nod where he can just hear your neck pot praise the lord we should listen if if we if we're in a position everybody with me if we're in a position that this end time puts us in which is the position of the full word being open to us and us not be be where we go have a moment to say well I don't know what that is I don't know how to live now you should never as a as a Believer you should never have have a thought in your mind to say I wonder how to live don't get quiet you can't say that you've been taught by the message by the preachers of this message and and brother brandom you've been taught there's if you got a problem there's two big books called Condor and Doctrine go read those that'll give you everything you need as far as setting in order as we were talking downstairs about the difference in a bride and a church but a church has to be set up a church has to have a Foundation a church has to have leaders all right and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body of the church which is us the beginning the first who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead going back to Revelations 3:14 the beginning of the creation of God that in all things what he might have the preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell now we were talking about it downstairs it was a question asked and we we'll cover it one more time that way if there's a question in your mind cu the question was is they couldn't understand how Adam uh in other words if you look at it one way it it looks like Adam you know the body was created and then God just breathed eternal life in him that's not what happened that's right right exactly if not that's the way we'd have to be now now listen Adam didn't have a choice because he was a god of the earth God set him up that way amen that was the first part of him that was his first son that was a Son of God the Bible tells you that amen a many Creator move stuff around right and and he was all over the whole world he wasn't just in one little spot called Eden sure he was in Eden when he got put in flesh but when he was ruling the animals and all it's like brother R said it's like the Holy Spirit he was just everywhere hard to understand but that's exactly the way it was but God wanted him though to go into one spot called a garden cuz guess what that's where me and you are going right remember the circle you got to have a full circle we fell so the circle got to come back around put us back in the Garden Eden in human flesh with Jesus Christ walking around with us seeing us face to face and living with each other for eternity praise God but Adam was not that way at first because remember if you look at Genesis 2:7 and what brother randam talks about and I'll get to it in just a minute where brother Ram talks and he he says talks about animal life well that's what you and I are in this we're animal life and we get a breath all right now remember we're going to talk about born by the Breath of God which is the bride and that's the new birth our eternal life not not not and we suck it down our nostrils no it's just it's just a metaphor right because he had to do something all right to get this Holy Ghost Inside of us he had to do something right Genesis 2:7 said the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathe into his nostrils the breath of life now watch it says stop there that semicolon stop and Man became a living soul we'll look at that because that looks like that's what he breathed but no Adam was a living breathing human being before God breathed eternal life into his body we'll see that in just a minute don't get quiet on me brother Dale has been preaching this for 50 years if you don't believe it you need to go talk to him John 20: 21 said then said Jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father has sent me even so send I you and when he had said this he breathed on them I want to ask you a question did God breathe the breath of eternal life in you when you was a baby okay then you were breathing human being before you got born again Adam was a breathing human being before he got eternal life put in his soul okay we we'll explain it because brother R really if you look at one word he says you'll see where he separated both of them peace be unto you as my father has sent me so in I you and when he had said this he breathed on them and said unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost now now listen they didn't even receive it then they just kept breathing regular human life amen they didn't get the new birth till 50 days later at pent Pentacost then he breathed eternal life into their nostrils he breathed life into their nostrils when they became a baby right but he breathed the breath of eternal life in them when they accepted it on the day of Pentecost right amen amen whosoever sins you remit they are remitted and whosoever sins you retain they are retained Blasphemous names brother Brown says church is the mystical Body of Christ born of the Breath of God now he's talking about a different kind of breath because this is not the breath when everybody gets born as a baby all right everybody with me all right did you get it congregation says amen the Church of God is born of the Breath of God God breathed into the nostrils look spiritually all right so that means he had to have a natural breath to begin with this is a spiritual happening right here watch what brother R said God breathed into the nostrils spiritually of Adam not naturally spiritually of Adam and he became a living Soul did you know the Pentecostals or the true Pentecostal church is born of the Breath of God all right then we talked about the logos what is the logos it is a the definition is to appeal to the audience in other words something that that is a that you can see but you can't see you see what it does everybody with me Loos created everything he God had to come down from all this big funnel he had to go down a little bit to logos where you and you and me can you and me can understand somebody standing out I don't know what he was standing on but he was standing there going let there be a world let there be a moon let there be a star and then he just kept thinking well now he had those thoughts if he was eternal come on if he was eternal they were in his thoughts to begin with I don't know how long ago before he made them but he had to come to logos or speech to speak it right it's way with me and you you don't speak something you you don't we formulate a lot of things in our head and it could be we could pick up the thoughts of God huh but what if we never say a word what now brother Bob he he gets the word of God the word of God comes oh he gets a sermon and he stands up here and goes let's stand and dismiss what' you get you didn't get what he was thinking so we didn't get what God was thinking until he what lust it or spoke it so that we can understand it then I can understand a an eternal God that can bring himself down to a place to where he can say let there be light and then that form be something that even steps a little further as brother R says into a theophany or a body so that we can really understand who he is cuz remember he's our daddy and for him to declare us to be him human beings he had to be one right a puppy dog of course a puppy dog don't have a soul but if puppy dog could look back and see a dog he'd say I look like that so that's my daddy that's the way we do we have but we have a soul so we can look back and say that's my father Adam could look back and say that's my father cuz he was made in His image he was made a human so that theophany is is a manifestation of a deity all right Theo Phan the god uh Phan which is to appear so it's where we can see him there was because remember when he walked in the cool of the day with Adam he appeared he was there he had some sort of substance in him that wasn't like Casper the Friendly Ghost where you can see through him and he just kind of floats over here and he kind of floats over here and this Cloud didn't come down and talk to Adam God came down and talk to Adam face to face cuz there was no sin there was no sin barrier now there's a sin barrier that's why that's why Moses we read the read it last week where Moses he said Moses you can't see my face but now I'll let you see my back part now it wasn't a dog cat or a camel it was a what human back which was a theophany that brother brandham said that was Jesus theophany that became flesh over here all right everybody with me the deity of Jesus Christ look just like this space here then he gathered it up into logos then he came from the logos down to Christ you say brother way why are you backing up listen we've got to this is we're talking about that head guy so we got to really understand that head guy before we Step Into The Headstone cuz remember the whole world rejected him when he was on Earth in human flesh the way he was supposed to be the beginning of the creation of God they hated him yeah they literally hated him so bad they killed him and I'm talking about the religious people I ain't talking about the bums and the murderers cuz the thief looked at him one day and said I know I know that hey hey buddy shut up this guy right here's done no wrong now how do you get that revealed to him he never seen him in his Circle he never seen he saw the other guy Circle cuz they were both thieves but he didn't see Jesus in their Circle he said in other words he down inside he was saying hey shut up I've seen this guy at church more than you've been don't throw things then he came from logos down into Christ it's just God coming down like this to what to the Earth then going right back into God again don't you see what I mean just revolving coming down from space from eternity rolling together coming down into the logos and the logos down into man then returning right back again for one purpose look to redeem that man that had fallen he came down here to picked us up now that's what he came for to be a redeemer and before God could be a redeemer he had to be according to the law a kinsman redeemer he had to be Kinfolk to us that's why MDC was God Almighty but he wasn't our savior right he was the king of Salem the king of Peace he had no beginning and had no ending right no father or mother it was God they just poured a little human flesh on top of him and appeared to Abraham but listen a prefigure to what we're seeing the son of man now where in us that's right excuse me the resurrection of Lazar 1951 now look he might have give a hand like a monkey he's talking about our he's talking about our physical body might give him a face like a chimpanzee might give him a foot like a bear but God put a soul in a man and we were talking if you weren't here last Saturday at Bible study shame on you but we really covered a soul and what it was and what happened and all those things I thought it was really we I got something more out of it just sitting there talking about it but this white cloud deity came down not in the animal in the man and now if you want to go back and dig up some bones let them dig up all the bones they want to that don't have one thing to do with the word of God then here's this man and now the man sinned and when he sinned he fell then that little cloud in there became marred in Black he didn't say he done away with it listen Adam did not lose eternal life in his soul God can't give you eternal life and then take it back away from you remember God don't make a mistake so if he breathe spiritually brother R say spiritually he breathed eternal life into Adam he became a Eternal person with God I'll read that here in just a minute so God couldn't take that away he lost the ability to become Eternal in his body because what are we going back to Eternity in a human body then the L God came down was made flesh and dwelt among us to redeem this man back to the love of the father and he came in by the baptism of the Holy Spirit Chase sin out of the human praise God and brings man back again into fellowship with God questions and answers 1953 he what did he make he made a spirit man if you'll notice after he made all the creation created a spirit man now look he created all creation then he created a spirit man theophany uh Genesis 126 man is everybody with me not in flesh yet that's genesis 2:7 created a spirit man the close reading of this now to the one that asked the question we find this that God gave Dominion of the cattle and the fish and everything to that man but in his making up there he made him in his own image to lead the cattle lead the Beast of the field just like the Holy Spirit leads the believer today see he was in other words Adam the first man in the lower creations of God the first creation was God himself what is create create doesn't have to be nothing to something it it means to be formed all right cuz listen you and I when we receive the new birth God does he listen he burns tears out kills nature changes your thought changes your ideas I hope changes the way we are changes the way we dress come on somebody changes the way we where we go and you're still in the same thing you sinned in yeah beer Bible that's what it was this held a beer I didn't have to cut my hand off and put a Bible hand on you can laugh if you want to but that's what God did that's right that's why folks this is a mystery that's why Jesus was a mystery he was a mystery of God revealed and you and I are part of that mystery according to amen Christ is a mystery God revealed he was the mystery of God and you and I are part of that mystery of God how that we walk in this world how that we can talk different act different even our thought processes are different and bur in the same shell though and we have oh oh shoot wait a minute we don't have problems when we get born again right how many of you got to do your taxes in April that'll humanize you as much as anything in the world is having to pay them taxes oh some of you get them back but I like to have mine during the year I don't want the government to keep mine praise the Lord anyhow but what am I saying this is the greatest mystery that ever hit the face of the Earth was that God can live inside of you Eternal person God live inside of you make you an eternal person with God and nobody can see except what you declare that's right now you sisters obviously and us men we don't smell like smoke we don't chew tobacco we don't drink beer I hope I hope we got all that out of the way but but real still though I mean if somebody sees sees brother Donnie and and myself um 30 years ago 40 years ago 35 years ago let's say you're a little bit older than I am 35 years ago and you look at that person and and and I don't know if you if if I've told I've told you this before but some of you you're new when I um when we had our class reunion we had our 10-year class reunion which was in 1988 and I was still a list them all got drunk while I was there curs like a sailor that person they knew cuz we graduated together we partied together I'm just going to tell you something if that's all right that I ain't perfect we partied we had fun and we even partied at the reunion oh if y'all didn't that's okay but I did so in 1998 went from 88 to 98 20 year reunion okay I received the Lord in 1997 got born again in 1998 well that was about the same time June or July there at um we went to U um to Kentucky and then we came back we had our class reunion 20-year class reunion Union well I was vice president and the president didn't want to do anything so I was a president so me and the other members the secretary treasure and all that we met six or eight times getting everything ready getting the food ready and and you know they want they they want to party and I'm like why do we need a wet bar for those you don't know that that's a beer bar or something you pay for and you go get a drink all right I said we don't need that and they're looking at me like who are where did you come from right to make a long story short they always vote you know who was the farthest who had the most kids who changed the most who changed the least well I got voted most changed my guy amen I got in the car and cried like a baby I said God you declared without me saying a word you declared that I had been changed and I still got that certificate in my closet praise God I don't know where it's at so but I still got it somewhere but yeah they they said who is this guy and then the and then the girl only Carlin the girl good friend of mine she she said so that because they had to you know everybody dance then you know the the people that won the girl and the boy she said okay let's dance I said no no no not that's not me any anymore you know and they're all going wow you have really just bummed us out buddy you was the Life of the Party 10 years ago what happened I said God happened that's what happened God happened but can somebody see that in your life I failed a 100,000 times between then and now but I still hold that one thing true I have changed God had changed me that's it brother amen if he had changed you please amen please know this God I know please know this person that'll change your life and even though that man inside of you watch that wet bar and said you had no desire to go do it anymore you had no desire to go dance anymore am I I mean this is just kind of off the thing but it's kind of the new birth you know it's kind of it's kind of that that logos Has Changed Me got inside of me and burned all that out you too you got you got testimony the same way I'm not no better than any of y'all like I said I failed a million times between then and now and if we have another class reunion which is coming up in Lord help never mind 2028 will be our 50th they'll see we really changed by then gray fat ugly yeah hey but that's life and this is life what we're living if you haven't been changed like that listen we have struggles come on that old me wanted to pull out there and dance and wanted to drink I'm just being honest wanted to do that some part of me said hey hey you used to be comfortable doing this what's wrong with you boy I said you ain't my boy no more that's what's wrong with me right and I ain't your boy no more I'm God boy now don't clap for me clap for God cuz like I said before I failed a million times since then but there's one thing for sure if you got the new birth if somebody hadn't seen you in years and they come around and they don't see a difference in you you got a problem you got a problem a real big one because how is the only way God showed who he was through Jesus was his Works am and listen Works can put you in hell but if it's works if it's a mechanics and the Dynamics together that's God we'll read that if we get to it in just a minute okay he wasn't an angel he came on Earth and took the form of a bondsman not an angel came down in the great Jehovah Glory but he came down he didn't he came down as a man to redeem man to die for man to die for as a man he never died as God he died as a man now listen God can't die right Jesus didn't die that's right sure he died for us but what he done was is that that shell of his was the example his soul went to hell that body did Lay cold and dead in the grave there was no life in it at all right but on the third day he picked that body back up quickened it made it alive and turned it back into a young man amen but he died as a man the sin of man was upon the son of man and he had to become a man in order to pay the penalty 1957 this is Brother brand this is his statement this is my statement I believe that Jesus is the son of God I believe in his body he was a man sure he bled he hungered he was born of a woman just like I was but his blood was not of a woman it was of God and Jehovah God the logos who brooded over the Earth in my message this morning brooded the first man Man Out of the Dust of the earth overshadowed Mary rooted over her to fulfill his word and created the blood cell listen we have to we have to have an act to make a blood we have to have an act to put the blood cell where it's supposed to go is everybody with me that didn't happen that's the way he's a creation beginning of the creation of God that's the way it should have been in the Garden of Eden and created the blood cell that brought forth the son of the Living God I believe in a body he was a man I believe in his soul he was God he was God's manifestation here on Earth God was in Christ reconciling him the world to himself I believe that he was not just a mere man though look now watch neither was he a prophet he was God Emmanuel I believe with all my heart that being true I can't prove it if I could then it wouldn't be a faith in the beginning was a spirit and all the P Fountain of goodness and mercy and power and all the good things of God God was the center of that Fountain and then the low God that went out of God in the beginning became what we called a theophany or Supernatural body now we just explained that all right I just want you to know that this brother Brown believed it too God's not just like the air he's in a body now the great mystery is though he can be in me and you right now being in somebody in China and Egypt Honduras right now the same person he can move like that me and you can't because we have what we have been encapsulated in this thing that's why I can't go through that wall but if I were to pass away right now my soul would go right through into another dimension but my body couldn't it' have to stay here because of sin that's why Jesus's body had to stay here he was born in sin but he took on our sin right amen right and we beheld him the only begotten of the father who's that Christ then here he talks to Moses Moses said I want to see you he said I make all my goodness pass before thee and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee he said thou can't see my face for there should no man see me and live now remember that same guy looked at the disciples several years later why he come as a redeemer he wasn't coming as a redeemer right here he was the Redeemer it was inside of him but that wasn't human flesh just like MDC MDC was almighty God and it was Jesus inside but it wasn't Jesus the flesh melaz wasn't our brother he just slowed down into this Dimension as Aaron said throw some 16 elements and it just kind of molded around him he talked to Abraham and when he walked out of Abraham's sight he disappeared right right just a pile of sand about that high pro probably when he went over into another dimension that's my God he's a Creator why can't he do that and I will take away mine hand and thou shalt see my back part by my face shall not be seen now he never said that to Adam until the fall then he then he went looking for Adam and then there was that Chasm then John 3 I mean Genesis 3 put that Chasm there he said but I'm going to come back right all right John 1 ver8 no man has seen God at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him all right now watch this word declared to lead out be leader now listen he's talking about Jesus standing in on Earth everybody with me right cuzz that was God right but it was God inside of him all right and he's declaring who he is he said show me where the scriptures I don't fulfill the scriptures show me where I don't do what the Old Testament said I would do show me and they couldn't show him that's we got Moses we got our quotebook watch this right here to unfold a teaching see they he declared God so clear that me and you understand that now they didn't understand it then right look to unfold the things related to God also used in Greek writing of the interpretation of things sacred and divine oracles dreams Etc so what did God do God went into a human body and and then Jesus declared who he was you and I just like I said before you'll declare who's inside of you I'll promise you that cuz the real you is the one you fight all the time all right one way or the other now brother Brandon I just this part is is where he's talking about father son Holy Ghost is hatched out of hell that's why the son of man never taught these things when he was standing on Earth that three and a half years of ministry on Earth he did not make a mistake with his teaching now he might have call Thursday Tuesday like us that do we get older but when he was talking when he was preaching when he was teaching when they wrote it down when the Holy Ghost told them to wrote it write it down because they couple of those weren't there when he was alive I mean when he was with Paul wasn't there Luke wasn't there Luke was with Paul but they have a clear understanding because the Holy Ghost said hey just like brother brandham when brother Bram sat there on spoken word's Original Seed he said he said the holy spirit said pick up your pen and write amen now believe you me whatever he wrote from there to where he finished that was God writing it well I believe he was all the way but I believe that is he was telling us this is what I'm telling you right here cuz I believe on spark word's Original Seed that's where everything turned and he focused stand on that son of man cuz after that come the seals and all the different the great powerful messages they' preached but father son Holy Ghost is hatched Out of Hell trinitarianism hatched Out of Hell three unclean spirits like frogs every false Doctrine did not come from heaven right every false Doctrine come from hell so the son of man as brother Ry many times we'll read it later on but not tonight many times he said the same message that Jesus preached the same message the son of man it was the son this is the son of man now didn't they say brother I made mistakes yeah 4,400 but when he was preaching it was God preaching to us they could not hold it for that past that 50th day cuz that was the day of Jubilee when everything went back to its original beginning the power was God power of God was taken back to its original look what happened on the day of Pentecost see it got took back right that original lion l i o n That Lion spirit that that first combat Beast l i o n not lying lion the Bold listen there was not a Baptist Church on every corner there wasn't a Methodist Church on every corner they preached one God they preached water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they preached Holiness they preached all these different things then when man kept coming and getting into it and tearing it apart that's what made it into denominations so during right there on the 50th the original that was the Jubilee it set man free if they would accept it listen as the brother said and I said many times before if you don't listen to what God's got he's going to bore you through your ear amen with an awe amen that's right and you might be able to hear that train go down that track you might be able to hear the birds and the Thunder and the lightning but you'll never hear the voice of God again right cuz you sealed yourself away you have turned down the acceptable year of the Lord amen that's right CU All Things Go free Matthew 28:18 Jesus said all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth that's when he stepped out of the Tomb brother Brown now continue with that same quote I kind of stuck that in there'll come another Year of Jubilee all right remember the Alpha and Omega those two Brides right all right so that's why that there had to be a turning back from the from what we're doing now now not now but denominationalism back to the faith of the fathers right and that's what brother R did he came to T to Loose Ends he came to present what the disciples presented in the ad 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 then when you go to 8300 that's when it starts being cut back right the cord starts being cut well we think it's this well we think it's this we think he was a light substance of God then they come from a what a saying to a deed to a Doctrine we'll cover that in the seals when we when we get to The Headstone up here we're going to have to talk about seals cuz that's what it is right amen but if you'll notice Pentecost has been falling in America for about 50 years somewhere on that just about 50 years Pentecost began to fall now what's happening the church is receiving the seven steel book of the revelation of Jesus Christ what happened is they turned it down and not one tenth of them can receive it he's talking about Pentecostal not one tenth of them can receive it but when you begin to see the Year of Jubilee when you amen no know that we can go free when we know that we know that we know we've heard the trumpet sound where we don't have to fuss and strain and pull but we're already secured in Christ we already have a name of the Lord Jesus Christ in baptism what's he saying we've writed all the wrongs we have all these great Mysteries that we're going to bring up in these Seven Seals and prove to you that them was the seals that were sealed from the eyes of the people that's why they had false Doctrine in the second age third age and all the way up to now cuz the book wasn't open the book was sealed until the time of the end it would have opened then but God said seal it till the time of the end this is the end time God can't go past his word had to bring all those Church ages up had to let them fall had to let them you got to name that you're dead I hate you because you you take out that Jezebel spirit I'm reading in Revelations 1 if you don't mind one and two because it's the it's what God Said to the church ages you've lost your first love got a name you're living but you're dead we have all these great Mysteries that we're going to bring up in the seals and prove to you that was the seals that were sealed from the eyes of the people of God being my helper I'll prove to you that they could not see that by the Bible if they would have seen it like brother brandham saw it and revealed it to us they' have never had they never went to NAA if they' went to n they got it correct I'll prove to you they could not see that by the Bible then sure if the Bible said so you'll believe it that they could not see nothing but Father Son and Holy Ghost until this time listen if he didn't then Luther's gone Wesley's gone Pentecost is gone right but God winked at their ignorance you know why cuz he waited he had patience to wait till me and you got here right not just a prophet you and me got here if brother brand would Hey Brother BR 1100 sermons right we believe that was a mind of God talking to us right is that right somebody say amen amen what if he stood up just like I said Bible would do let's say only believe and dismiss no he gave us 1,00 sermons that he give us now 60 years to get those sermons right and only again brother John a tenth of the people in this whole nation even knows who William brandham is I think about all those cities I go through now I don't know I'm just saying I have looked and tried to find message churches on the way like when I go to Illinois I go to Chattanooga I don't know anyone in Chattanooga Nashville biggest city as it is uh Brother Joseph Hamed's in Mur in Murphy's Boro and brother siler's in um Manchester then you go on up to Clarksville Tennessee big city now you got brother Bor in Hopkinsville but Paduka is a great big town great big city beautiful city far as I know they ain't a Believer there then you go on up to my where where I hunt there marry in Illinois and I tried to find I I tried to find somebody and there's nobody there never heard of William Brandon never heard of him sad right you better know yourself as you're fortunate that God spoke to you and gave you even just an opportunity to press play If The Press Play people would do that go into a city where brother Brown's voice has never been heard and stand on the corner and press play I pay for it but don't come into this church and try to do it don't come into a church that believes in a five-fold Ministry and try to do it don't put that down my throat yours either but there is a place for it everybody all right Revelations 3:14 says unto the angel the Church of lay out of sins that's us these things sayith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God now remember God was what his first creation was God himself which is the Son of God the lust which is a lower form of the same man so that we can understand him no man has seen God at any time I'm going to say no man has understood God at any time how can you understand somebody's never had a beginning how can you understand somebody that can be here on Mars Venus China at the same time see there you're silent but I know that God and you know that God because he's declared himself to us that he can be the holy spirit inside of me and inside of you and inside of the person in China and the Philippines and all the different places right that is God that can move that that moves faster than the speed of light now Jesus is the beginning of the creation of God Revelations 1 I didn't even where brother BR said he's the beginning and where the continuation we'll get to that in a little bit later is that right then when was God created he is the beginning of the creation of God and God is eternal is that right but when God was created when a little baby that was conceived in the womb of a mother a virgin and she began to develop these cells within her to bring forth this little baby that was the beginning of God's creation right for God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and became Emmanuel God With Us the beginning of the creation of God in him dwelt Eternal Light all right there was no darkness in this man at all all right that's what I have to believe I have to believe he is the sinless one but he took on my sin because you know what God judged him if he's in you he can't judge you that's why we already been to Hell if we got the person who went to hell in us that that conquered Hell In The Grave we got him in us someday we're going to realize that and we're all going to go to the Grave there were just reflecting the light of one Perfect Light and there he was the perfect light of God beginning of the creation of God God perfecting him Church perfecting his church God himself came down into a blood cell and WRA the blood around him the blood cell The Germ of Life Of God himself wrapped in this blood cell that brought forth the son Christ Jesus now look what he did what he did does by that to make you perfect and bring you back into Fellowship he brings you through that blood cell into himself you get it through the blood cell of the Lord Jesus that enveil the life of Jehovah and we coming through the blood cell becomes a part of that life so deity itself lays in the man that's received the Holy Spirit you are a son I'm a brandom by birth and the part of Mr M brandom is in me and if you become a son and daughter of God part of deity lays inside of you now Blasphemous names here's where we're going to we'll just piece all this together about what happened with Adam and what happens with us but here Jehovah Witness in their book now talking about Jehovah Witness it says it's the breath that you breathe is your soul now that cannot be right the breath that you breathe is not not your soul all right so the breath Adam was breathing was not his soul he was a living be he was a living being but his soul didn't breathe in and out his soul is a real person that individuality and it listen that Soul stuck in your body right right that Soul was stuck in Adam's Body no transmigration right can't become another Soul somewhere else now you're one time you're one kind of Soul next time you're somebody else that means Susan never mind me me oh never mind me and somebody else I'll just become Sue she'll become me boy that would be confusing wouldn't it cuz who are you you're schizophrenic you may be Brother Gary you may be brother Boyd you may be brother Bob you may be whoever no you're one person soul and that's who you are and you got a name all right so that makes it more simple that oh I can be this but I can no you are you you are the one that's going to be judged as we read many scriptures downstairs Saturday you're going that soul is what's going to be judged look where you'd be now the breath is wind and what the is what you breathe into your nostrils it's just wind I take the scripture from back and God breathed the breath into his nostrils and he became a living soul I want to ask you something if he was a man now look if he was a man what kind of breath was he breathing before God breathed his breath of life into him right see what kind of breath he was a breathing living man right well then if that be so now he's talking about this talking about every animal's a living Soul what he's saying is Adam's breathing the animals are breathing but Adam's different cuz God's fixing to give that Soul eternal life he's not going to give eternal life to these because because they don't have a soul everybody with me so now I'll read it here then if that be so then every animal is a living Soul cuz they breathe a human soul and our soul and all together he's talking about breathing back and forth think about that when you cat or dog breeze on you but look and it makes sense the animal sacrifice would have been sufficient we wouldn't have had to have a man die for us if that's true but they don't have a soul so that Soul couldn't come back on us or into us so brother the argument don't stand but what God did he breathed the breath of eternal life amen then he became a living Soul a soul that can't die amen now watch we're going to get into honey Plum up to your elbows notice breathe the breath of eternal life into his nostrils and he became an eternal Soul cuz look cuz God breathed comma stop listen not what nature done right listen we were naturally breathing before we got born again and right now you're naturally breathing again am but we have the Breath of Life inside of us because we have the new birth but it didn't change our breathing I wish it would walk a couple of miles and see if you're Eternal I mean see if your breath Eternal I don't even want to go there but look cuz God breathed not what nature done but what God did all right breathe the breath of life into his nostrils and he became a living Soul then you say uh Adam died brother brandom but remember before Adam died he had a lamb that redeemed him Hallelujah those who he forew he called he got a lamb to why did Adam need a redeemer if his breath that when he became a living person his breath was eternal he didn't need a sacrifice then the lamb was provided for Adam because already in his nostrils he had become the breath of Eternal God and he became a living Soul he was a Son of God not his breath Africans call it amoya let's continue on go through this but look paragraph 190 but God especially upon Adam cuz he didn't on us at our birth all right is everybody with me but I was a full grown Son of God God created him that way all right breathed the breath of eternal life and he became an eternal person with God he was a person before he became an eternal person with God you were a person before now you're an eternal person with God if you have the new birth he had power like God he was an amateur God he was God of the earth not God Of Heaven now God of the earth and someday the sons of God will again become Gods blasphemous names continue on the church is a mystical Body of Christ born of the Breath of God I've already read this I read it again did you get it amen Church of God is born of the Breath of God God breathed breath into the nostrils spiritually of Adam not nature not what nature done spiritually into Adam he became a living Soul do you know the Pentecostals or the true Pentecostal church is born of the Breath of God then he talks about there in St John and see whether the church is born by the Breath of God or not like Adam was in the beginning and then he reads the scripture and what do the scripture say he breathed on them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost Church born of the Breath of God when this stature not statue when this stature has molded itself up there in condition God's breath breathes upon them receive the Holy Ghost then you are a son of God you can join anything you want to but you're born in the Church of the Living God born by the Breath of God God breathed upon them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost ghost oh my there you are but when you become a child of God you are born by the Breath of God am man better leave it alone right there he must have got some rebound from his uh discernment where somebody was going no I don't believe that I'm glad I don't have discernment like that did you ever notice a little baby when it's born his little muscles twitching jerking when it comes to the Earth it receives a spirit then it becomes a living soul and as soon as the soul goes back from that little body there's another one waiting for it if this Earthly T Tabernacle be dissolved we have one waiting it's not something hanging up in the closet it's inside of you because first God makes the Soul and Spirit it just goes to the bodies and then when we leave here we only change Dwelling Places and go to another one for this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting so that's our consolation comforter 1961 but as soon as it's born talking about a baby you don't see it but there's a spirit in the soul hanging near that mother to come into that baby just as soon as it's born think about that next time you witness a birth or or God was there something was there it wasn't the devil the devil might have been there to disrupt everything but but when that baby goes and starts crying God did that God did that and until the age of accountability God still did that but when you come to the age of accountability if I can get to it I'll read it real quick brother M says now you make a choice amen all right look just as soon as that baby's born God has created a soul and created a spirit to being that baby just as soon as it's born into this world that little baby becomes now look that little baby becomes matured and it begins to learn then it becomes a living Soul now it wasn't a dead Soul before now it's got to make a choice life or death in your soul then it's got just like like Adam and Eve set before a tree of right and wrong it makes its Choice and then it becomes intelligent it's growing all the time in God's Great economy now brother Ram just to clear this up listen when your soul goes in your body as a child as a baby it stays there until you die or translated all right before I close this subject I know there's a question in your mind you will want to know if I believe in the doctrine of pre-existence now I explained that last Wednesday the Mormons believe that we all existed before we ever come down here we had a mind we had intelligence we thought about this we had a plan that we wanted to make Jesus be the the the F the Savior and the father liked his plan more than he lik Lucifer's plan and Lucifer preached his message to a bunch of other people and they came down here in human bodies and we got down here in human bodies and here we are brother Brown they asked him one time and I didn't bring it but brother Brown what were you before you were born he said you were nothing only in the mind of God were you something remember the thought those thoughts stayed there until one day you needed a soul and a body I mean a soul and the spirit right there's not a body that ever comes here that don't have a soul where it can God's not going I didn't know that was going to happen no God knew everything had them all ready had them all ready to go and then that soul that you have by the new birth is not exchanged is changed CU if it was exchanged that mean you just take this one out and put another one in confusing this is the best way because it God thought of it right I don't believe in the Mormon doctrine of pre-existence of souls any more than I believe in reincarnation in other words coming back is something else or the transmigration as far as the amoya the the I can breathe in brother Donnie long enough and he'll become me me Gary he won't even want to get close to me now be careful here and see this it is not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God I wish the people Seed doctrine people would see that it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God it's the word or seed way back there too far back for the human mind to grasp the Eternal God look with eternal thoughts thought and decreed Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated and neither was born neither had done good or evil but God knew they would by what for knowledge so it was the thought and then that thought became expressed and God b Jacob back bought back Jacob because Jacob alone was seed he saw that Jacob would take the birthright and Esau would not Jacob alone had the seed that is why he had respect to the birthright and Covenant of God if you are true seed you will hear that word the spirit will baptize you into the body of Christ filling you and empowering you because you're not filled or or powerful any other way the spirit will baptize you into the body of Christ filling you and empowering you and you will receive the word for your day and age that's that's what the new birth is Ezekiel 18:20 I brought these from downstairs from Saturday the soul that sinth it shall die so do you sin in your body no do you sin in your second realm every day but you ask for forgiveness but it's the soul that sinth it shall die now look the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father so he's separating into persons just because my daddy was a drunk which he was not just because if your daddy was a drun or your mama was a prostitute that has no bearing on you oh yeah it'll bear it'll be bearing on your head and your brain but you can't say I can't get born again cuz my mama was bad I can't get Bo you can't blame your mom and daddy for it you're going to stand before judgment as an individual amen the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father NE shall the father bear the iniquity of the son the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him all right Matthew 16: 26 Jesus says what is it a man that profiteth he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul wow so what does your soul do it makes you an individual a unique person gives you free will and a choice that's it right it don't migrate it don't die and and God pulls that one out and throws it away and brings you a new one no he cleans you up praise God you'd be a different person we are a different person you understand we're a new creation but we're not a different I'm still way Dale you're still whoever you were before you were born again you just have new thoughts brother Brown covers that many many times but now watch this when that sacrifice is re receiv by the fire it goes up like that the smoke goes up you rise with your sacrifice now watch you rise with your sacrifice we're sitting in Heavenly places all right our soul has been redeemed so watch you rise with your sacrifice into the heavenlies and you're sealed away from the things of the world then our souls on his altar right now listen it's not somewhere else still inside of you but what it's done is you've been translated as we read in coloss you've been translated right into that that's why your thought process is different what have you done then after you have been after after you have been died then what are you to do then you are conceived a new he's talking about dying out to yourself you are conceived a new you was first conceived in iniquity now you're conceived in something new what is it the Living Word not just letters on the page The Living Word of God something living out of sight out of you all that changes it now doesn't it now we're through the struggle after seeing what you got to do now what happens you're conceived in new and the Living Word what is it the word becomes alive in you you begin to see things different where once you couldn't see that now you do see it there's something different now makes all the scriptures come together right that makes sense the Baptist can read the Bible an unconverted person can read the Bible and get a total different perspective than you get they do it every Sunday there something different now makes all the scriptures come together makes everything dovetail just right that's why brother Brown said that the that the um manifestation of the new birth in the end time is receiving what not the word for Luther's day that's out there in the denominations he said you receive the word for your day right recognizing what your day and it's message now something's begin to happen now you die to your own thinking now you're conceived because we are Washed by the Water of the word is that right what do you do with a baby as soon as it's born you wash him as soon as a man has died to himself and born of God he's Washed by the Water of the word that's why I'm telling you I'll tell you dad's told me a million times he said If somebody walks in this door and they sit on the front row and they're just abs absolutely on fire with God give them about 6 months you'll see if it was good or not we've seen it happen time and time again but I had rather you sit like brother Lis did sit and listen take your time right process it let God speak to hear not here let God speak to your heart that's right and let a preacher preach to you cuz he's going to what discern the thoughts and intents of your heart maybe not discern as far as I know what you're thinking no but God does and he'll bring a word down that'll help you sit there and just keep listening then if you want to shout that's okay if you want to sound on the front row that's fine but we've seen way too many people like brother Brown said what a house on fire windy day burning the candle at both ends you put you light the candle on both ends and it runs out twice as fast amen so settle down listen to the word of God stay in the word of God cuz listen if you stay under the fountain long enough you will get wet right he's Washed by the war of the word if it says Jesus name you say Jesus name says You must be born again you say the same thing every what God says you're washed by that water of the word now you're ready now for life you're ready to start now you're born a new born in the family of God with a new parent yes sir your tutors used to be now you got tutors that's now you that is now you got a new parent you can't be born without having a parent well praise God so if you're born in the Brotherhood of a church that's what you got if you're born in a Creed there you are but if you're born in God conceived in his word you got a new parent that's God ready to make his word known Among Us with you speak it through you amen speak it through through you oh a new parent that parent is God he's ready to take his word now that he's already spoke and lay it in you and make it come to life now look now he's he's he pronounced all that and he said see question mark he's asking the question now you have your training right go you're born again now you have your training you're ready to go into training now child training that's the hard part when you think you ought to do this and the word Cuts you around and shows you something else everybody who who's been there me I have been there before while they believe that over that don't make any difference what they believe here's what God said you must be about the father's business now you're getting born again now you're getting right getting straightened out you have a new parent so in order if you're born again and got a new parent then you got a new nature the old nature is dead now you say the old soul the old nature that's attached to your soul is dead and you got a new nature you once was going one way now you're going another way you once was going this way down now you're going this way up your affections are set on things above a new affection you don't love the things of the world no more your affections of God Ephesians 1:3 says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding him without blame before him in love real quick musicians come on let's stand to our feet he didn't Clarksville Indiana which is not far from Jeffersonville he said I see some of the Tabernacle folks here I'm going to say this about the big sister talking about the Tabernacle one thing that the Tabernacle needs up there at our church at the Tabernacle at Jeffersonville now this is where brother brandham preaches is a rededication and a refilling of the Holy Ghost that's right everyone to get down to The Altar and pray until they get a renewing see that's why we're right here now a renewing or refilling not get the new birth again get a refilling of the Holy Ghost that's right everyone to get down to the Altar and pray until they get a renewing of the Holy Ghost the whole church be filled with the power of God that's what we need not only the Tabernacle but the body of Christ Universal it needs a refilling I like David said one day restore to me the joy of my salvation now he had not lost his salvation but the joy of it how many of us have think maybe we've lost kind of the joy of our Salvation amen now he had not lost his salvation but the joy of it and when it comes to a place that I can't enjoy my religion when it comes to a place that I can't enjoy my religion oh I'd rather go out and eat instead of going to church well I got family coming on Sunday during church time I got my back turned so in case anybody will throw anything it hit me in the back of the head everybody believe brother was a prophet I'm going to turn around and see if we raise our hand I believe he a prophet right he said there's something wrong somewhere because it's supposed to be joy unspeakable and full of Glory what shall we do with Jesus 1963 let me say something this uniting time to see churches uniting Nations uniting it say uniting time of God and his bride too and I say this with reverence and respect I believe that the bride of Christ is called wow that was in 1963 I believe she's sealed in the kingdom of God I believe the mechanics is there now watch what he watch his verbiage watch what he says they're waiting for the Dynamics that'll take her off the earth into glory in the Rapture everybody with me I believe it with all my heart yes sir we don't know how he's going to do it but he shall do it I know how he's going to do it through the word of God through the message of the hour studying read your Bible he is the Dynamics now watch watch what he says a little bit later and we'll we'll stop right here we just become members of the machine of his body forming oursel into his image and see him uniting himself with us in his works with his love gifts as he hands them to us just before the wedding supper remember we get married down here we go to if we don't get married down here we don't go to a wedding supper we get married down here we go there we're waiting watching for that look their their big churches being to be United the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit that we have worked in a small measure while The Headstone is coming down to unite with the body watch what he says here but when that head and body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost will raise her up just exactly like that even the dead that's dead in Christ for hundreds of years will raise in the beauty of his Holiness to take a flight to the skies the Dynamics is the holy spirit One More Time Lord listen to this I say if we don't take all that Steam and know how to direct it fundamentally in the word he's talking about remember he said the the certain group had had PL money in the bank but no checks right this one over here had plenty of checks but no money in the bank all right that's what all this just to save time I said now if you would just take all that Steam and know how to direct it fundamentally in the word the big regime of God will start moving on he talking about the Pentecost there's where Satan got in now watch this to make it all mechanics and no Dynamics now we see that but now we see in the message a lot of Dynamics and no mechanics somebody say Amen same people having a shou and good time which is fine but where's the word of God to grow you back all Dynamics and no mechanics see we've got to put it together we've got the power of the Holy Spirit how many believe that we've got the power of the Holy Spirit but we've got to come back with the word to feed this machine to feed the machine we can't feed it on Creeds or false Doctrine it won't burn it chokes up the flu and it will not burn it it was made for the word of God man shall not live by bread alone but by every word not just part of it every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God I like what he says to feed this machine we got to go back to the word of God amen amen to feed this machine let's sing a song God bless you have you been to Jesus for the cing power are you in the blood of the Lamb are you ful trusting in his this are you wased in the blood of the Lamb are you wash
