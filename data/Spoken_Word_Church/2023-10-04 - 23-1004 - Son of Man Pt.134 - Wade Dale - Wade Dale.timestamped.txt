[19:00] Book of
[19:01] John
[19:03] because we're if we're
[19:06] required to have these virtues right
[19:10] they're requirement right they're
[19:12] requirement to come to adoption all
[19:14] right and if Jesus came to adoption on
[19:16] River Jordan by I mean not River Jordan
[19:18] at Mount
[19:19] Transfiguration by
[19:22] type then there's got to be somewhere
[19:24] that he Jesus opened the door
[19:29] that that can happen to
[19:30] us right and he did and we'll read it
[19:34] this we'll read it tonight so let's go
[19:36] to the Lord in prayer Lord thank you for
[19:38] this evening that you've give us thank
[19:40] you for the

[19:56] raise them up Lord for for your honor
[19:58] and Glory father May there be a
[20:00] testimony in all this that we're not
[20:02] seeing now but Lord may we see it a
[20:03] little bit later father just bless us
[20:05] now touch the ones Lord that are

[20:21] also have a safe trip over here father
[20:23] just be with each one give us this day
[20:25] our daily bread in Jesus name we pray
[20:27] amen
[20:29] the Bible says in the beginning was the
[20:31] word the word was with God the Word was
[20:33] God and that word was made flesh and
[20:36] dwelt among us and we beheld his glory
[20:38] the glory of the only begotten of the
[20:39] father full of
[20:41] grace and truth now you take this man
[20:44] that we've been talking about that word
[20:47] was the what that was the theophany that
[20:49] was the that was the logos the speech
[20:51] the word it's all Jesus Christ it's all
[20:54] God it's all the father it's only one
[20:56] person all right everybody with me so
[20:58] that word is going to be was made flesh
[21:00] back then and now that same word in all
[21:03] those attributes except for we're not
[21:05] healer or savior or
[21:07] Redeemer but how close are we though
[21:09] where the Bible says that eternal life
[21:12] will be given to someone for being good
[21:14] to
[21:16] you is't that you imparting eternal life
[21:20] okay let's see what we got here in the
[21:22] Book of John so full of grace and truth
[21:25] let me read one more then you sit down
[21:27] Jesus answered and S them very I say to
[21:29] thee except a man be born again he
[21:31] cannot see or understand the kingdom of
[21:34] God and you be seated the Lord as his
[21:36] Blessing to the reading of the word
[21:38] again thank you for coming and we
[21:40] appreciate all of you love you with the
[21:42] love of the Lord and we thank you for
[21:44] all the things that you've done for the
[21:46] again for the funeral last week and and
[21:49] we sure did uh we sure did appreciate
[21:52] all of you coming and working and and um
[21:55] taking a little bit of load off of us we
[21:57] sure appreciate that John John 16:12
[21:59] says I have yet many things to say unto
[22:01] you now look this is John 16 all right
[22:04] we're fixing to go to John 17 this is
[22:07] John 16 Jesus is Jesus is getting ready
[22:10] to
[22:11] leave all right he is the spirit of
[22:17] truth right I know it's Wednesday night
[22:19] but an amen will do just fine like
[22:21] Sunday and Wednesday be good to say Amen
[22:23] okay if you don't believe the scripture
[22:25] then you're in the wrong place you need
[22:27] to go find another building
[22:29] but Jesus was standing there he said
[22:31] look I have yet many things to say unto
[22:32] you but you cannot bear them now in
[22:34] other words why was he going to tell
[22:35] them everything and they not understand
[22:39] it right so he was going to hang on and
[22:42] he said hang on a minute how be it hang
[22:44] on that's good um southern English how
[22:47] be it when he the spirit of Truth is
[22:49] come he will guide you into all truth
[22:52] there was one man standing there that
[22:54] had all the truth he was the truth all
[22:56] right but he knew that there was
[22:58] something inside of him that was going
[22:59] to come out on the day of pentec or the
[23:03] burial and Resurrection but on the day
[23:05] of Pentecost that was going to divide
[23:07] Out Among a group of people and then
[23:08] they were going to start understanding
[23:10] what he said all right same way with me
[23:12] and you you go through your life you you
[23:14] go through your life numb and talking to
[23:16] somebody the other day just you're in a
[23:18] fog you think you're you think you're
[23:20] clear and you think your thinking is
[23:21] clear and you think everything's clear
[23:23] and I'm clearly thinking and I'm clearly
[23:25] doing and if you born again you're in
[23:29] fog the devil's got a big old fog over
[23:32] your brain all right why to make you
[23:35] believe something that you shouldn't
[23:37] believe whatever the world gives you but
[23:39] now look but when he the spirit of Truth
[23:41] has
[23:42] come all right he will guide you into
[23:45] all truth so then he there's your guide
[23:47] that's going to guide you into all Truth
[23:49] for he shall not speak of himself like I
[23:51] said before he's going to speak through
[23:52] Ministry to a group of people called the
[23:55] bride and we're going to see in just a
[23:56] minute that even Jesus I caught this in
[23:58] this um uh what we're going to read the
[24:01] in John 17 we' read it many many times
[24:05] before but remember Jesus is he he come
[24:08] to die for everybody all right all right
[24:11] just listen to me he came to die for
[24:12] everybody John
[24:15] 3:16 whosoever believeth on him all
[24:18] right okay for God shall love the world
[24:20] he gave his only begotten son who shall
[24:21] believe in him shall not perish but have
[24:24] everlasting life all right there's a
[24:26] group that that's going to cover
[24:28] everybody with me all right but there's
[24:30] a group that's going to go on and not
[24:32] just him going to to save
[24:35] them there's a group of people that's
[24:37] going to be
[24:40] him John 3:16 is not he didn't say be
[24:43] like me he said I'm going to die to save
[24:47] you if you'll accept
[24:50] me so while this growth if there's not
[24:52] something else in the scripture where
[24:54] Jesus is standing there he's going I
[24:55] know there's going to be a group that
[24:56] just going to that's just going to love
[24:58] me and and I'm going to be their Savior
[25:00] and that's going to be pretty much it
[25:02] and then you got the foolish virgin you
[25:03] got the people that are you know cup of
[25:05] water in my name which really not even
[25:06] included any of this but the foolish
[25:08] virgin at least is Sanctified by the
[25:10] Holy Ghost right but there's a group of
[25:13] people when Jesus was standing there
[25:15] we'll read it in just a few minutes
[25:16] where he just totally separated the
[25:18] group I'll show it to you in just a
[25:20] minute cuz whosoever whatsoever he shall
[25:24] hear that shall he speak and he shall
[25:26] show you things to come and thank God he
[25:28] gives us revelation we should be
[25:31] Revelation people all right and when we
[25:34] get into this statue of perfect man up
[25:35] to The Headstone where we see the
[25:38] headship of the church coming back in
[25:40] the opening of the seals that's not skim
[25:43] melt that's not baby food all right
[25:45] you're not going to get it pureed or
[25:47] pureed or pure Aid how you say
[25:50] that y'all said it three different ways
[25:53] so I'll say it scrambled
[25:56] up
[25:59] Mama used to way before there
[26:01] was Gerber when we were growing up she'd
[26:05] take English peas and just mash them up
[26:07] you know and feed them to terance that's
[26:10] why he is the way he is so can't eat
[26:13] anything
[26:14] green but that's what God's done though
[26:17] through all the years he's pureed ped
[26:19] beat
[26:20] up patted the word and said here
[26:23] baby you can swallow this but remember
[26:27] then when you get to the Apostle Paul
[26:29] who never knew Jesus but when the Holy
[26:31] Ghost filled him and he became an
[26:33] apostle and when he became a prophet to
[26:36] the church age especially when he saw
[26:38] that group at Ephesus he knew that
[26:40] there'd be a group that would understand
[26:42] this and then there'd be a group that
[26:43] would understand this and it'd be a
[26:44] group that would understand more cuz
[26:47] even his brother Peter brother Peter
[26:49] Peter and Paul comes together after so
[26:51] many years preaching the same thing why
[26:53] they got the same Holy Ghost all right
[26:56] so then he looks at Peter and Peter
[26:58] looks at John at Paul and says um Paul
[27:01] says things hard to be
[27:03] understood and we wrestle at those
[27:05] things you know to their own destruction
[27:07] but then Peter comes up in in First
[27:10] Peter second Peter and he's saying just
[27:12] what we were talking about Statue of
[27:13] perfect man he's the one that brings us
[27:15] the Statue of perfect man and then it
[27:16] took a a prophet brother brandham to the
[27:19] master builder to bring it all back
[27:20] together all right so that you can so
[27:23] that you can now physically see what a
[27:26] pyramid is for whatever thing is for it
[27:28] where the headstone is why there's a gap
[27:30] in there where it says holy spirit we
[27:33] ought to get to that sometime but listen
[27:35] to
[27:36] this and I heard it word a voice of
[27:38] great multitude and the voice of many
[27:40] Waters and the voice of Mighty
[27:41] thundering saying hallelujah for the
[27:42] Lord God omnipotent reth let us be glad
[27:45] and rejoice and give honor to him for
[27:46] the marriage of the Lamb has come and
[27:49] his wife has made herself
[27:52] ready and to her was granted that she
[27:54] should be a raid and fine linen clean
[27:56] and white for the final linen is the
[27:59] righteousness it doesn't say of
[28:02] God it says of the Saints you have come
[28:05] to a place of righteousness not
[28:08] self-righteousness no way but
[28:10] righteousness through Jesus Christ
[28:12] through a
[28:14] mature understanding of the message now
[28:16] I don't mean just the message I mean the
[28:18] Bible all right when I say the message
[28:20] the Bible is included we don't disclude
[28:22] the Bible and just take the message all
[28:24] right if you're going to throw one away
[28:26] I'll throw the message away give me the
[28:28] Bible then know what brother Ram said fa
[28:30] found a resting place lays in the word
[28:32] of God all right but we know that it
[28:34] does tie together we know that for a
[28:36] fact and no matter how much we try to
[28:38] think that we're right and saying a
[28:40] Creed or joining Church you'll steal
[28:41] what you were until you're actually born
[28:43] again of the spirit of God it doesn't
[28:45] change you what all this other stuff
[28:47] doesn't change you the new birth is an
[28:50] experience that's what changes you
[28:52] that's what puts you in the body that's
[28:54] what puts you in this as we were saying
[28:56] the other day that's what puts you into
[28:59] the line of adoption it puts you in
[29:01] family to where you can even be
[29:02] considered an adoption all right cuz
[29:06] remember the devil has got kids and and
[29:09] Jesus Christ never spoke of them people
[29:11] well he did called them snakes vipers
[29:13] and all that other stuff all right told
[29:15] them they was of their father he told
[29:17] them what lineage they were all right
[29:19] but now he did tell us though in the
[29:21] Bible what lineage we
[29:23] are cuz there's going to be a group of
[29:25] people that's going to be like him now
[29:27] what is him what is Jesus Christ
[29:30] that right that's the fullness of Jesus
[29:33] Christ headstone the whole thing the
[29:35] head and the body is together in this
[29:38] picture right here but now you got to
[29:40] remember that this part up here when he
[29:44] died and went to heaven come back as the
[29:48] Holy Ghost he came back as the
[29:50] Cornerstone the Chief
[29:52] Cornerstone bbody with me this was not
[29:55] on the church now in part it was all
[29:59] right because it was they were led by
[30:02] the Holy Ghost but as we've been reading
[30:03] for many times right here the Antichrist
[30:06] Spirit comes into the church and even
[30:09] into the
[30:13] bride even into the bride brother Ram
[30:17] said the bride went to NAA to try to
[30:20] help and change everything and got
[30:21] caught up in that same system all right
[30:25] how that the Antichrist would come into
[30:26] the church file it make it lukewarm
[30:28] formal and
[30:30] Powerless all right now hang on with me
[30:34] just for a minute let's go to St John 17
[30:36] this is where I want you to see
[30:37] something real quick then we'll move
[30:39] on I was looking for you know you look
[30:42] at Jesus and you say well that's the
[30:44] embodiment of God right that's the embod
[30:46] Jesus is everything that we need all
[30:49] right he's the whole he's the whole the
[30:53] whole Angela if you want to say that
[30:56] he's everything there's no title that he
[30:58] doesn't cover in Christianity all right
[31:01] now there's no there is no listen to me
[31:04] there is no attribute of God that's not
[31:08] right
[31:10] there every attribute of God that is God
[31:14] that is Jesus Christ in human flesh God
[31:16] in human flesh Jesus Christ standing on
[31:19] the earth speaking to
[31:22] people because the only thing we've got
[31:24] even to the even to the headship even to
[31:27] the uh when the Bible says The Headstone
[31:29] was rejected we'll get into that a
[31:30] little bit later on but remember when I
[31:33] say headstone I'm talking about Jesus
[31:35] Christ the
[31:37] fullness all right the fullness of Jesus
[31:40] Christ is him standing on Earth in a
[31:43] human body called the son of
[31:46] man all right is everybody with me now
[31:50] but what is inside that son of man God
[31:53] we know that the Holy Ghost everything
[31:55] that Spirit of Truth um the faith of
[31:58] Jesus Christ brother R says the virtue
[32:00] of Jesus Christ the knowledge of Jesus
[32:02] Christ The Temperance of Jesus Christ
[32:03] the patience of Jesus Christ the
[32:05] godliness of Jesus Christ he says the
[32:06] brotherly kindness of Jesus Christ he
[32:08] said love which is Jesus Christ all
[32:11] right so that's all Jesus Christ so now
[32:14] wherever he's standing he is the
[32:16] embodiment of all that
[32:19] right now we know we got to be a part of
[32:21] it somewhere right we have to be a part
[32:25] of this this is where I was looking at
[32:27] just a little bit ago at
[32:29] home but watch now here's
[32:33] Jesus the fullness of the godhead
[32:36] bodily nothing else outside of the Bride
[32:40] he's it and remember when he was talking
[32:43] the bride's inside of him you and me are
[32:45] inside of him when he's speaking this
[32:47] message all right and we've got three
[32:49] and a half years to listen to what he's
[32:51] got to say and that's pretty much all we
[32:53] got to go
[32:56] on but Paul can write 80% of the New
[32:59] Testament off of those three and 1/2
[33:00] years that Jesus lived on Earth and he
[33:03] wasn't even there but the holy ghost
[33:05] that was in him was there the holy ghost
[33:08] that was in Paul was there so now here's
[33:11] St John 17:8 now watch he's he's
[33:14] standing and to me this is The Lord's
[33:16] Prayer to me we know what the Lord's
[33:18] Prayer is Our Father who are in heaven
[33:19] Hallowed be thy name right but to me
[33:22] this is the prayer to the bride
[33:25] separating us from the world not not
[33:27] putting not taking us out of the world
[33:29] but separating us from the world cuz
[33:32] remember there was a day when brother
[33:33] brandham now he wasn't Jesus Christ but
[33:35] he was more of Jesus Christ than me and
[33:37] you are right now I'll promise you that
[33:39] everybody say Amen all right he was a
[33:42] prophet an end time Prophet that God
[33:44] spoke through him so much to where he
[33:47] said on tape one time he said this is
[33:49] not William Brown
[33:50] speaking this is God speaking I'm just
[33:53] using his voice and you know what you
[33:56] know what it sounded like right it
[33:57] didn't sound like some great Thunder it
[33:58] was brother Brown's voice okay so this
[34:02] is a man brother brandom has come to the
[34:04] end time to bring us come at the end
[34:07] time to bring us that part of Jesus
[34:09] Christ back that had never been here
[34:11] before that was the
[34:13] fullness he was in part I know in part
[34:17] Paul said even I prophesy in part but
[34:19] that which is perfect is come that which
[34:21] is in part will be done away not done
[34:23] away done away thrown in the trash but
[34:25] built on to
[34:28] everybody with me cuz even during Paul's
[34:30] time The Headstone was not understood
[34:33] like it is
[34:34] now okay he didn't have the seals he
[34:37] didn't have the great opening of the
[34:39] word like that John John had it in a in
[34:41] an image form or in a he could see what
[34:44] was going on and he had a small
[34:46] Revelation but he was only told to write
[34:50] right he was only told to write it down
[34:51] what he saw all right well now you and I
[34:54] are reading what he saw amen
[34:58] but we got to make it live remember we
[35:00] were talking about the white paper and
[35:01] the black ink pretty cheap to do that
[35:04] but when you live it and worth 10,000
[35:07] worlds so now read with me real quick
[35:09] this is Jesus now he's getting ready to
[35:13] leave all right now if I'm not
[35:17] mistaken I did this in a hurry this
[35:19] afternoon if I'm not mistaken this
[35:21] prayer is prayed somewhere around the
[35:23] upper
[35:24] room somewhere close I'll verify that
[35:26] make sure of it somewhere around the
[35:28] upper room now he may not be in there
[35:30] with them but he's praying this prayer
[35:32] somewhere out maybe Garden of Gethsemane
[35:33] I don't know I'm we'll look and see but
[35:36] he's doing one thing he's by
[35:38] himself and he's
[35:41] praying
[35:43] right and then when he talks about them
[35:46] now watch when he talks about
[35:49] them everybody with me we're going to go
[35:51] slow you don't have to say Amen just
[35:52] listen to
[35:54] me when he talks about them
[36:01] that's talking about the ones that are
[36:03] there with him which it was only 11 at
[36:06] the time Judas if it was The Upper Room
[36:08] Judas had already left he was the devil
[36:11] anyway so he wasn't going to understand
[36:12] this so it was only to 11 people so
[36:15] after they died we're
[36:17] finished no he must be speaking to the
[36:20] group when he says them he's speaking of
[36:23] them and
[36:25] them because watch what he says for I
[36:28] have given unto them The Words which
[36:31] thou gavest me and they have received
[36:34] them and have known surely they didn't
[36:37] know that at that
[36:40] time if they' have known who he was he
[36:44] wouldn't have died
[36:46] alone they ran away when he died on the
[36:50] cross there was no one
[36:52] there not one person hung around and
[36:54] said hey that's my savior that no
[36:57] because that I can prove it to you
[36:59] because as soon as now he's Jesus die
[37:02] buried resurrected live for 50 days
[37:05] walking among his his people and he's
[37:08] getting ready to ascend and and he says
[37:10] I'm getting ready to go and he says go
[37:12] and receive power on high you know we've
[37:14] been reading that scripture what's the
[37:15] first thing they ask him are you going
[37:17] to restore the
[37:21] kingdom we heard you say that several
[37:23] days ago you were going to you know a
[37:25] month or two ago we heard you say was
[37:26] going to destroy this Temple and raise
[37:28] it up in three days and we want to get
[37:30] rid of these Romans so we really ain't
[37:32] understanding what's going on but we
[37:33] know you're pretty tight guy with God so
[37:35] you know are you going to you know like
[37:37] wipe these people off he said no he said
[37:40] go to
[37:41] Jerusalem go to Jerusalem and wait what
[37:43] to be endued with power from on high in
[37:45] other words wait until the Holy Ghost
[37:47] comes inside of you and quickens what
[37:48] I've already said so this group of
[37:50] people that's why St John 17 is to
[37:55] the right
[37:58] of the first church
[38:00] age but he's also speaking to the Bride
[38:03] of the last Church
[38:05] age cuz we're going to culminate this
[38:08] now the bride in the middle there's no
[38:09] problem with them but remember he's
[38:12] standing in the Candlestick with his
[38:14] hands out the Alpha and Omega right but
[38:17] he is everything in between there is
[38:19] bride down through the church ages but
[38:21] that first church had to be established
[38:23] because it was the foundation of all
[38:25] Christianity is in first
[38:28] church and God is is through Jesus
[38:31] Christ is depending on them to start it
[38:33] but they're not starting it right
[38:35] here so God is p praying a
[38:42] prophecy everybody with me he's praying
[38:45] a prophecy listen he's not a prophet
[38:47] he's the
[38:48] prophet okay he is the
[38:53] prophet and he's getting ready to go to
[38:55] Calvary
[38:57] he's had the mount Transfiguration
[38:59] they've told him what he was going to do
[39:01] he told them in the upper room what was
[39:03] going to happen and this right here
[39:04] watch but just let just just
[39:06] watch just just pretend you're you're
[39:09] sitting there and you're sitting at the
[39:10] Rock on the Rock beside of Jesus and
[39:12] he's praying nobody but him but you can
[39:16] listen well we were there cuz we were in
[39:18] him in Holy Ghost form you know so we
[39:21] didn't actually hear it with our ears
[39:23] but it is part of your attribute right
[39:27] this right here is part of your
[39:28] attribute all right so this is part of
[39:30] the statute of perfect man this is the
[39:32] part that to me brings it together and
[39:34] then separates what needs to be
[39:36] separated watch for I have G given unto
[39:38] them The Words which thou Gest me all
[39:40] right so he gave a three and a half year
[39:43] sermon to a group of people that no one
[39:46] listen No One understood except just a
[39:48] little bit Thou Art the Christ the son
[39:51] of the Living
[39:52] God we don't know what's going on but we
[39:55] just believe what you said
[39:57] then Peter jumps up and saysi just cut
[39:59] the guy's ear off so you know so they
[40:01] were
[40:03] confused they have received them what
[40:05] the words what Jesus spoke the words I
[40:08] spoke they have received them and have
[40:11] known surely that I came out from thee
[40:14] and they have believed that thou did
[40:16] send me now that had to be a
[40:19] prophecy no one standing where he was at
[40:22] on that day knew what he was talking
[40:25] about with
[40:29] me I pray for
[40:32] them I pray not for the world there's
[40:35] been Brides brides churches Brides I'm
[40:37] going to read it in a minute brother
[40:38] Brown separated it God's going to do it
[40:40] right here I pray not for the world but
[40:44] for them which thou Hast given me wait a
[40:48] minute for they are

[41:08] back in him and I am glorified in
[41:15] myself he said I am glorified in them
[41:19] that I'm talking
[41:21] about now if he's glorified in them he's
[41:24] already put us in a position of
[41:25] glorification
[41:27] everybody with me now let's continue on
[41:30] and you'll see the rest of this story
[41:32] unfold and now I am no more in the world
[41:36] he was standing right there in the world
[41:40] breathing but he had moved into another
[41:42] dimension or another another place of he
[41:44] was praying this prayer for us all right
[41:49] but these are in the
[41:51] world and I come to thee in other words

[41:55] thine own name which is who what's the
[41:58] name of the father Jesus Christ keep
[42:00] through Thine Own Name Look Those whom

[42:22] people and this group of people are
[42:24] going to be just like
[42:29] me he separated a whole group of people

[42:34] the statute of perfect man and be just
[42:36] like him they're going to be saved
[42:38] according to John
[42:41] 3:16 and he's laid that out but he's
[42:43] separated a group of people that they he
[42:47] come from them to
[42:50] they while I was with them in the world
[42:53] what now listen when he was how many
[42:55] people

[45:08] yet but if you've done all that and you
[45:11] you you do the things of God we make
[45:14] mistakes we know that for a fact but we
[45:17] don't do the things we used to do I hope
[45:21] not so this is the sanctifying down here
[45:24] of the Soul we were talking about the
[45:26] other day down here unclean Spirit goes
[45:29] out God can't dwell in unclean vessel
[45:32] Holy Ghost comes in seals you in and you
[45:35] are born again but you are not ad I mean
[45:39] you're not adopted you're in the line of
[45:41] adoption but you're not adopted you're a
[45:43] newborn baby in Christ Desiring the sin
[45:47] in milk of the word preach me the gospel
[45:50] tell me something about my salvation
[45:53] then we get to where now in John 17
[45:56] he's saying hey now you got to be like
[45:59] me come on now you got to be like
[46:03] me and that's like
[46:05] him and for their sakes I sanctify
[46:08] myself that they also might be
[46:10] Sanctified what through the truth
[46:14] there's no other way that's why down
[46:15] through the church ages they couldn't
[46:17] get all the way out the prophet of God
[46:19] said because they didn't have all these
[46:21] virtues because they hung on some to
[46:23] their old to their old tradition are
[46:26] their own idea come on that's why we had
[46:30] to come back to water baptism name of
[46:32] the Lord Jesus Christ cuz the other one
[46:33] was not right we had to come back to no
[46:36] eternal hell cuz that other one was not
[46:38] right we had to come back to no Trinity
[46:41] Doctrine cuz that's what the truth is a
[46:43] trium
[46:45] being that's why we had to come back so
[46:47] that we could even start up the statue
[46:49] perfect man that's not even in the seals
[46:52] that's not even the son of man ministry
[46:54] right
[46:56] that's receiving the Holy Ghost and
[46:58] being a Christian this is being
[47:02] him remember you get a checkbook at the
[47:05] bottom of the pyramid you get a
[47:06] checkbook with his name written on it
[47:08] and when you write the
[47:10] check he verifies it and then he is the
[47:14] one that takes care of it when we get up
[47:16] to adoption he hands you the checkbook
[47:19] there's nothing on
[47:20] it you write the check and you sign your
[47:24] name watch
[47:28] this that they also might be Sanctified
[47:31] through the truth now so it's got to be
[47:33] the truth remember Jesus was standing
[47:36] speaking this word right here look at me
[47:38] speaking this word right here he was the
[47:43] truth there was no error in him there
[47:45] was no there was no thought of a trinity
[47:48] there was no thought of all these
[47:49] doctrines that's going around that was
[47:52] not in him the truth was in him sanctify
[47:55] them them through thy truth then he said
[47:57] before Thy word is truth am I getting
[48:00] somewhere you see where where he's do
[48:02] you see where he's just pulling this
[48:03] thing apart he said there's going to be
[48:05] a group that's going to believe on me
[48:06] they're going to be saved Sanctified
[48:07] filled with the Holy Ghost and then
[48:09] they're just going to be a
[48:10] baby by their own choice but there'll be
[48:13] a group of people that's going to be
[48:14] just like me cuz remember Jesus started
[48:16] as a
[48:19] baby standing here
[48:21] he's 33 years
[48:24] old right
[48:26] he's a going
[48:27] man and for their sake I sanctify myself
[48:29] that they also might be Sanctified
[48:31] through the truth now watch verse
[48:34] 20 here's the separation look neither
[48:37] pray I for these
[48:40] alone so it looks like up here he he
[48:43] took a group of people and he separated
[48:45] them said they're going to be just like
[48:47] me now he says neither I pray for these
[48:51] alone but for them also which Shall
[48:54] Believe on me through
[48:56] their word St John
[48:59] 3:16 or believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[49:02] and thou shalt be
[49:06] saved but
[49:08] watch that they
[49:10] all may be
[49:14] one when we get to heaven yes there's
[49:16] going to be crowns and we're going to
[49:18] know brother Brown was a prophet cuz
[49:20] they know it
[49:21] now they're going to know that that
[49:24] maybe that brother Dell was a pastor the
[49:25] church and he took a group of people to
[49:27] The Headstone and and whatever you want
[49:28] to say and brother bisc and different
[49:30] ones right they're going to get their
[49:32] Crown they're going to get their reward
[49:34] but listen same Holy Ghost amen same
[49:37] Holy Ghost everybody gets the same Holy
[49:40] Ghost if you got the Holy Ghost all
[49:42] right so he said that they all may be
[49:45] one we're not going to get to heaven and
[49:46] go well now bless
[49:49] God you might have made it but
[49:52] I I got this in my house and I I got
[49:55] transparent walls so you can be able to
[49:57] see through it I did this right here I
[49:59] got I look look at where my star
[50:03] was no we're all born again we're all
[50:07] Brothers when we cross a curtain of time
[50:10] my precious brother that's all they said
[50:11] they didn't come up and say Hey Brother
[50:12] r i preacher mer message Right Down the
[50:14] Line no they were just glad they made
[50:17] it that they all may be one now look
[50:20] hold on as thou father art in me and I
[50:24] in thee that they there's that lay again
[50:27] that they also may be one in us so he
[50:30] brings it all back together that the
[50:35] world may believe that thou has sent me
[50:38] let me add just a little bit sorry I'm
[50:39] going to add to the word through
[50:41] them that's what he's saying cuz he says
[50:44] right here and the glory which thou Gest
[50:47] me I give to
[50:50] them no less the
[50:54] same that that they may be one even as
[50:57] we are one now I've covered this many
[50:58] times
[50:59] before he's standing there saying that
[51:02] we're going to be
[51:06] him if he said I and my father are one
[51:09] you and I are going to have to be able
[51:10] to say I am my father
[51:13] one that the glory which thou gavest me
[51:17] I have given
[51:18] them that they may be one as we're one i
[51:22] in them thou and me look that they may
[51:26] be made
[51:29] perfect that's the only way you're going
[51:31] to get perfect that's why we had to have
[51:35] the Prophet come to line it all back up
[51:37] as Elijah did at on Mount Carmel he put
[51:41] all them rocks back where they supposed
[51:42] to go he put everything back in order
[51:45] and then the fire
[51:47] fell they had to get everything back in
[51:49] order though cuz what the churches
[51:51] denominations 400 prophets had beat the
[51:53] thing up they kicked the rocks out they
[51:56] they you know it was a bloody mess cuz
[51:58] they cut theirself and all the other
[51:59] stuff what did they get out of
[52:01] that yeah
[52:03] nothing but all Elijah had to do was put
[52:06] everything back together and he said
[52:07] okay Lord I you told me to put the water
[52:09] around here every how many three pots or
[52:11] whatever many pots it was you told me to
[52:13] dig the D ditch and I've done everything
[52:15] at your
[52:16] word then the fire fell all right and
[52:20] consumed the
[52:22] sacrifice I and them thou and me that
[52:26] they may be perfect in one or complete
[52:30] and that the world may know now how's
[52:33] the world going to know through you
[52:36] that's
[52:37] right that thou has sent me and has
[52:42] loved them now watch love
[52:44] them as thou love
[52:47] me he's lying if we missed it
[52:51] somewhere so he's opened a
[52:54] door there's that door in John 17 he's
[52:57] opened the door he said all right
[52:58] there's going to be something in the
[52:59] world that's just going to believe on me
[53:00] and that's okay but then there's going
[53:03] to group be a group that's going to be
[53:04] perfected they're going to be just like
[53:06] me because they're going to be
[53:07] me listen without the Holy Ghost you
[53:10] can't be
[53:11] God but with the Holy Ghost you have a
[53:13] chance I said you have a chance cuz
[53:16] you're still a free moral
[53:18] agent everybody good with that I just I
[53:21] just thought man this is so wonderful
[53:22] that I I wanted to find somewhere where
[53:24] where Jesus just separated a whole bunch
[53:27] he separated right there in John
[53:29] 17 he let us know what we're supposed to
[53:31] be he let us know there'd be a group of
[53:33] people that would just believe on
[53:35] him but they would be a they and a them
[53:39] that would do more than just believe
[53:41] that they would yield their self and be
[53:44] that same person that walked on the
[53:46] earth called Jesus
[53:49] Christ all except the Healer and but I'm
[53:52] talking about where does healing come
[53:53] from comes from God but
[53:56] lay hands on
[53:58] the sick and they shall recover okay you
[54:03] didn't do it but there's a
[54:05] contact
[54:06] right couple water my name though we get
[54:09] to the other side you know white Throne
[54:10] judgment how's he going how's that
[54:12] person going to get eternal life through
[54:15] you listen Paul couldn't receive the
[54:17] Holy
[54:19] Ghost Cornelius couldn't receive the
[54:21] Holy Ghost until somebody with the Holy
[54:23] Ghost was there to give it to him yeah
[54:25] right right the seed life comes through
[54:28] the body prophets already told us that
[54:30] you got to have somebody you got to have
[54:31] a connection well that connection is who
[54:35] God somebody a god-filled
[54:41] man to lead us through that's
[54:44] right we don't put anything on the man
[54:46] y'all know that you understand what I'm
[54:48] saying but if the if all this is Jesus
[54:51] is saying all this through the world
[54:53] there I'm not going to be here but
[54:55] there's going to be a group of people
[54:56] that's going to show me in the world
[55:00] that's going to show me and we sometimes
[55:01] we look so ragtag and so horrible and
[55:04] pitiful but I'm like what brother Boyd
[55:06] said I when when a sister was singing
[55:08] the song how do they do without God how
[55:12] do you get up in the morning without God
[55:14] how do you get up like I was saying at
[55:15] the funeral if you if this is all we
[55:19] got we're in
[55:21] trouble if we'd be you know like
[55:24] somebody say you know it'd be we'd be
[55:26] people most miserable we'd be miserable
[55:28] group of people if that was the
[55:32] end no that was just the
[55:35] beginning it got brother how back to
[55:38] that place to
[55:40] where the Holy Ghost took him
[55:42] across and he's living in it right
[55:45] now he's living in that theophany
[55:49] waiting to come back here to get his
[55:51] body glorified everybody all right
[55:55] I mean I love the Lord when he when he
[55:57] just backs you up and shows you stuff
[55:58] and say well I was wondering I was I
[56:00] thought Lord there's got to be where you
[56:03] can tell the people you separated them
[56:05] out because most of the time he didn't
[56:07] now sure he separated the snakes and the
[56:09] Vipers and the year of your father the
[56:11] devil that was a group over here but
[56:13] when he was John 17 he wasn't sure he
[56:16] was dying for them you understand what
[56:18] I'm talking about but there only group
[56:19] of people going to believe
[56:20] him he died for all but only a certain
[56:23] amount of people are going to believe
[56:24] him right but there's going to be a
[56:26] certain amount of people like he said
[56:28] that's going to be one just like he was
[56:30] standing there him and the father was
[56:31] one they're going to stand on this Earth
[56:33] and be one just like
[56:34] him impossible yes without him but with
[56:38] him I'm going to take what he said I'm
[56:40] going to take what he said what he said
[56:42] 2,000 years
[56:49] ago so then brother random having the
[56:52] spirit of God having the prophetic in
[56:56] his soul just like come on just like
[56:59] Jesus he wasn't the prophet he was an a
[57:01] prophet but he had to come to bring a
[57:02] special message to hone it down so that
[57:05] we can say we was he talking
[57:08] about or was he talking about the
[57:11] Baptist or was talking much to mthod
[57:14] this no he said I'm not going to call
[57:16] you a church
[57:18] anymore the church the church get
[57:23] saved but the bride gets born again the
[57:27] bride has his potentials the bride has
[57:30] an ability to be adopted or an ability
[57:34] to you say well what are you talking
[57:36] about listen if you got the baptism of
[57:38] Holy Ghost there's got to be something
[57:39] inside of you pulling you
[57:42] up I want more I'm having a problem
[57:46] right here help me right here Lord but
[57:47] when that problem's over take me up a
[57:49] little
[57:50] higher take me up a little higher let me
[57:53] understand what brother Dell saying let
[57:54] me you understand what these brothers
[57:55] are saying that's right listen he'll
[57:59] have to lead you and guide you if truth
[58:01] is told to
[58:03] you he promised he would so now he's
[58:06] standing in spirit form he standing in a
[58:08] prophet he said now I'm going to call
[58:10] you bride I'm going back to St John 17
[58:12] I'm going to tell you there's going to
[58:13] be a
[58:15] church there's going to be a bride that
[58:18] you'll understand because remember he's
[58:20] getting ready that's at the first seal
[58:22] right at the first of it
[58:27] he says look broken to who not to Christ
[58:29] but to the church and then he he kind of
[58:31] mumbles around he goes I I hope I mean
[58:34] you people I'm GNA call you bride all
[58:37] right so now let's go back and listen
[58:38] this is what he's this is what he was
[58:40] saying broken to whom not to not to
[58:42] Christ but to the
[58:44] bride it these seals will not be broke
[58:46] to the church church nominal and
[58:50] probably 90% of the people in the
[58:53] message
[58:57] but I'm going to call you
[58:58] bride I'm going to say he's talking to
[59:01] me giving me a chance to be able to
[59:06] understand not just that God sent a
[59:11] prophet so never since Jesus Christ was
[59:13] on the earth in St John 17 telling us
[59:16] what we're supposed to be telling us
[59:18] there'd be a group of people that would
[59:19] not get it all that'd be a group of
[59:21] people he would save because they just
[59:23] said' Lord save my soul' you died for me
[59:25] on the cross at Calvary and I give
[59:27] myself to you well praise God they'll be
[59:31] in heaven all
[59:32] right but there's a group though that's
[59:34] got Satan's answer that's a formid who
[59:36] was the most formidable opponent on
[59:41] Earth the one I just talking about so
[59:44] now if he said if he was the most
[59:46] formidable opponent that Satan had 2,000
[59:49] years ago Jesus standing on Earth in
[59:52] flesh and he's praying
[59:56] for me and you to be just like
[1:00:00] him so the most
[1:00:02] formidable opponent on earth now is his
[1:00:05] bride cuz he's not here he's depending
[1:00:09] on
[1:00:12] us listen all the other Church ages are
[1:00:16] dependent on us cuz see let me tell you
[1:00:19] this when when Martin Luther when he
[1:00:22] passed away all right ever have any
[1:00:24] hundreds of years ago when he passed
[1:00:26] away he was a bride Church age messenger
[1:00:29] with a
[1:00:30] message people believe that message were
[1:00:33] called out of the age right but remember
[1:00:37] brother Ram said not all the way out cuz
[1:00:39] they kept a little bit of few doctrines
[1:00:40] they kept a few stones of
[1:00:43] stumbling
[1:00:45] that's all right everybody is that okay
[1:00:48] false Doctrine but stumbling stones but
[1:00:51] when he went across a curtain of time
[1:00:54] God didn't start throwing stuff at
[1:00:56] him he made it he said here's your place
[1:01:00] this is your place you were a church a
[1:01:02] messenger and these are your people cuz
[1:01:04] what happened to brother brandham when
[1:01:05] he went across a curtain of to he said
[1:01:07] oh these all Brams he said no they're
[1:01:08] your your
[1:01:10] converts Millions they're your converts
[1:01:14] they're not Paul's they're not irenius
[1:01:16] they're not Martin Luther Wesley they're
[1:01:19] yours when Luther went across a curtain
[1:01:21] of time he had to stay there cuz he
[1:01:23] didn't get to come back across the
[1:01:25] curtain he stayed over there but there
[1:01:27] was a group of people that I'm sure
[1:01:29] hugged his neck and said thank you for
[1:01:31] getting us out of that Catholic
[1:01:33] Church I believed your message for the
[1:01:36] day now I don't know where these other
[1:01:38] ones are but I know this is a safe place
[1:01:41] I know now see they didn't none of them
[1:01:42] know it was a sixth
[1:01:44] Dimension they just knew it was the
[1:01:46] place they went to we know that's why we
[1:01:49] can answer any question almost that's
[1:01:51] asked brother randam has just covered it
[1:01:53] all and we can go back and say no that's
[1:01:56] a sixth Dimension no they're not in the
[1:01:57] arms of Jesus no they're not walking on
[1:01:59] streets of gold come on somebody no
[1:02:01] they're Mama's not sitting at the feet
[1:02:03] of Jesus right
[1:02:06] now she's in a sixth Dimension an
[1:02:09] eternal place and they're sitting there
[1:02:12] I don't know they can sit on a rock
[1:02:13] whatever they want to sit on listen they
[1:02:15] can stand for 50,000 years it ain't
[1:02:16] going to matter but they're in a place
[1:02:19] waiting on a pull to get them out cuz
[1:02:23] remember they told brother bandam said
[1:02:25] look we're not complete here we don't
[1:02:28] eat and we don't drink but we're coming
[1:02:32] back to
[1:02:33] Earth with
[1:02:36] you
[1:02:39] wow guess who's going to guess who's
[1:02:42] going to be the one that opens the
[1:02:45] door not a
[1:02:47] church not many
[1:02:51] brides
[1:02:53] one one bride final voice not voices
[1:02:57] final voice to the final age under her
[1:03:01] messenger is the bride in the end time
[1:03:04] the St John 17 bride that he stood and
[1:03:07] in his infinite mind God infinite mind
[1:03:10] he saw us tonight reading that same
[1:03:13] scripture and knew somebody was going to
[1:03:16] come to that Perfection that Jesus
[1:03:18] prayed we'd all come to now listen Jesus
[1:03:21] prayed that's a pretty good prayer I'll
[1:03:23] take a prayer from Brother D any day but
[1:03:25] now Jesus trumps him okay I'll take a
[1:03:29] prayer from Jesus all right so he stood
[1:03:30] there and told me what I was going to be
[1:03:32] all
[1:03:33] right then he sent somebody like brother
[1:03:35] Dale to remind me of what was said all
[1:03:39] right remember Jesus didn't come to
[1:03:40] bring you your
[1:03:42] inheritance he came to get you back to
[1:03:44] your inheritance all right cuz your
[1:03:47] inheritance never was lost in eternity
[1:03:51] you can't lose something in eternity it
[1:03:53] got l lost when we got put in a pawn
[1:03:55] shop down here like I said Sunday this
[1:03:59] was all withheld he had to hold the
[1:04:02] book he couldn't send us down and and
[1:04:05] that's why I don't agree with the people
[1:04:07] that thinks that we come here with
[1:04:08] eternal life no
[1:04:12] way I want a
[1:04:14] hand no not that kind of
[1:04:17] hand I want a
[1:04:20] hand if you knew and I'm I'm serious you
[1:04:24] knew you were
[1:04:25] lost if you knew when you when you come
[1:04:29] through your life you knew you were lost
[1:04:32] well praise God the rest of y'all must
[1:04:33] be saved from the foundation of the
[1:04:36] world we are but you realized you were
[1:04:39] lost every one of us in this
[1:04:42] building some of you ought to realize
[1:04:44] you're still
[1:04:47] lost well I didn't say
[1:04:50] that
[1:04:52] but if we we were lost there's no way we
[1:04:56] can have eternal life inside of our
[1:04:59] soul God won't dwell in unclean vessel
[1:05:01] remember there's only God or
[1:05:04] Satan that's why I want to know where
[1:05:06] that seed was if we had some kind of
[1:05:07] seed in us where was it it cannot be in
[1:05:10] your soul and that's where it's supposed
[1:05:11] to be cuz when you get born again it's
[1:05:15] in your soul not in your spirit not in
[1:05:17] your
[1:05:20] body let's just realize we were all lost
[1:05:23] we needed Jesus Christ to come from
[1:05:26] Glory through some way of
[1:05:29] Salvation I'm saying for us to believe
[1:05:31] that way of Salvation to believe that he
[1:05:34] died for us and then the Holy Ghost
[1:05:37] comes in us as on the day of Pentecost
[1:05:40] listen why didn't on day of Pentecost
[1:05:41] why didn't just Peter just stand up and
[1:05:42] say we had it to begin
[1:05:45] with no Peter was the first one to stood
[1:05:48] up and said this is
[1:05:52] that that was told by by the prophet
[1:05:54] Joel that I'll pour out my spirit upon
[1:05:56] All
[1:05:58] Flesh he realized he was lost if there
[1:06:01] ever a person realized they was lost was
[1:06:02] Peter and then he realized he got saved
[1:06:05] got the Holy Ghost got the new birth all
[1:06:07] right so let's just put that
[1:06:09] away but those names could not be
[1:06:13] released me and Susan was talking about
[1:06:15] the other
[1:06:16] day listen there's no way we were
[1:06:19] individuals before you came on
[1:06:22] Earth only in the mind of
[1:06:24] God and it was a Jee pool of God sure he
[1:06:27] knows
[1:06:29] exactly but you and I even as fathers I
[1:06:33] didn't know I only had two kids inside
[1:06:34] of
[1:06:36] me but if I was a heavenly father that
[1:06:40] knew from beginning to end I'd know
[1:06:42] exactly how many kids I had and when
[1:06:45] they'd come how they'd come what n or
[1:06:48] day they'd get born again and I would
[1:06:49] give them eternal life and bring them
[1:06:51] into the
[1:06:52] family to me that's very simple all
[1:06:55] right not that we always was and we just
[1:06:58] realized brother R was a prophet listen
[1:06:59] Satan knew brother R was a prophet why
[1:07:02] did he Badger him all the time why' he
[1:07:04] fight them demons all the time like he
[1:07:05] said he did go back to a motel room and
[1:07:08] them demons bother him that he cast out
[1:07:10] in the in uh I was thinking about that
[1:07:12] folks listen I'm going to tell you
[1:07:14] something sometimes my dad gets in a
[1:07:16] state of torment and I think man
[1:07:21] devil you got to leave
[1:07:24] think of all the demons though that my
[1:07:26] dad's had to do cast out of
[1:07:30] us maybe not by land off hands but by
[1:07:32] the word of God that's the only way the
[1:07:34] the real that's the only way the real
[1:07:37] devil's going to get cast out is by the
[1:07:38] word of God not by shaking shouting
[1:07:40] speaking in tongues and all that other
[1:07:42] it's preaching the word of God and if
[1:07:44] somebody preaches the word of God it
[1:07:46] actually does it cast them out of me
[1:07:47] because I had a lot of different things
[1:07:49] going on in my life I don't know about
[1:07:50] y'all am I just the only one you CLE
[1:07:53] times you look at me like
[1:07:54] are you really that bad yes I was really
[1:07:57] that
[1:07:58] bad so were
[1:08:03] you but I thought I thought devil I
[1:08:06] talking about was yesterday when we put
[1:08:08] him in that new facility I said you
[1:08:11] devil I said you need to get
[1:08:13] away but if brother Bram had that
[1:08:16] problem remember he said he it would
[1:08:17] keep him up at night them demons would
[1:08:19] come into the motel room and torment him
[1:08:22] for casting them at being you know you
[1:08:24] cast a demon out where'd it go it went
[1:08:25] them swine it went somewhere brother R
[1:08:27] said you better keep your eyes
[1:08:29] closed he said that demon will come into
[1:08:32] you he said keep your eyes closed be
[1:08:35] reverent don't move around he said that
[1:08:36] demon of epilepsy number one he always
[1:08:38] talked about epilepsy was a was a real
[1:08:41] horrible demon and and you know what
[1:08:43] brother I mean Jesus had to deal with it
[1:08:45] too remember he come to them people and
[1:08:48] they said well your your um your 12
[1:08:51] can't cast them out he was rolling
[1:08:52] around and frothing into mouth and
[1:08:54] falling in the fire and all that that's
[1:08:56] an epileptic fit Jesus said only by
[1:08:59] prayer and fasting can we cast these out
[1:09:02] there are some demons that are rough and
[1:09:03] there are some demons that are not too
[1:09:06] rough that's just the way I see it so
[1:09:09] let's pray for a pastor let's pray for
[1:09:11] all these preachers you don't know how
[1:09:13] many times you know you get up here and
[1:09:15] you and you and you speak and then you
[1:09:16] get home and you got a pound and
[1:09:18] headache or or something happens or or
[1:09:22] you just have a horrible Monday or
[1:09:25] something you know well it could be that
[1:09:26] there was a demon had to leave somebody
[1:09:29] by the preaching of the word of God and
[1:09:30] that demon was trying to find a place to
[1:09:32] go so he just come back and torments you
[1:09:35] I'm talking about all of
[1:09:39] you you think about it listen there's
[1:09:41] more going on in the spiritual world
[1:09:42] than you are in the natural
[1:09:45] world it's real busy in these other
[1:09:48] dimensions come on it's real busy we're
[1:09:51] we think we're busy they're busy 24/7
[1:09:54] they don't get tired they just keep
[1:09:56] pounding and pounding and pounding all
[1:09:59] right so pray just pray for you pray for
[1:10:01] you preachers and Elders deacons all
[1:10:03] pray for everybody that that has a
[1:10:05] position in church cuz the devil hates
[1:10:07] us he hates us he don't even like us a
[1:10:09] little bit he hates us we hate him
[1:10:12] too but there's got to come one there's
[1:10:14] got to come a real bride in other words
[1:10:16] St John 17 has got to come into being in
[1:10:19] a bride in the end time and be Jesus
[1:10:22] Christ because the head stone is him
[1:10:26] complete right that's what we're heading
[1:10:28] toward and see look as it gets more
[1:10:30] narrow and narrow and narrow and narrow
[1:10:33] to a
[1:10:34] point there's listen in in just listen
[1:10:38] to me for a minute in in all of
[1:10:40] Christianity it started on the day of
[1:10:42] Pentecost First Church age right A lot
[1:10:44] of
[1:10:45] people less less
[1:10:49] less you said oh now we got 7 billion
[1:10:52] people well 8 billion now I think it
[1:10:54] went to 8 billion people on the Earth
[1:10:56] but how many real bride how many real
[1:10:58] bride not just churches not foolish
[1:11:01] virgin bride Born Again filled with the
[1:11:06] Holy Ghost Bride in the world right
[1:11:11] now I don't think they as many as there
[1:11:13] was when it wasn't many people on
[1:11:17] Earth but there's got to come one cuz
[1:11:20] brother Ram always talked about honing
[1:11:22] he always talked about you know the RoR
[1:11:24] The Razor's Edge the the cutting the the
[1:11:27] the the cutting away and all the
[1:11:28] different things like we were talking
[1:11:29] about the the two-edged sword that that
[1:11:32] divided the soul and the spirit and the
[1:11:34] body so in other words there must come
[1:11:37] one who's this one this one is
[1:11:40] them the them of John 17 is this one
[1:11:44] right here everybody with
[1:11:47] me see I don't want to be exclusive but
[1:11:51] God made us
[1:11:52] exclusive
[1:11:54] because he's going to have somebody
[1:11:55] that's going to be like him don't matter
[1:11:58] if it's two or three or four or one he's
[1:12:00] going to have somebody like him he made
[1:12:02] a way for it and he even prayed for us
[1:12:04] to get
[1:12:05] there why are we not there
[1:12:10] yet Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God now
[1:12:13] not not somebody not a preacher they can
[1:12:16] preach real
[1:12:17] good but the word of God is quick and
[1:12:20] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[1:12:22] sword see even to the dividing aunder of
[1:12:26] Soul and Spirit and of the joints and
[1:12:29] Marrow so there's Soul spirit and
[1:12:30] where's your joint and
[1:12:32] Marrow in your body your flesh right so
[1:12:35] it's dividing those three up Paul says
[1:12:38] and is a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:12:40] intents of the heart and we saw that
[1:12:43] through brother R's Ministry we've seen
[1:12:45] it several times here all right so now
[1:12:48] the soul of man is that Genesis 126 man
[1:12:51] you got to think back what we were
[1:12:52] talking about this this past weekend
[1:12:54] that is what I'm talking about that's
[1:12:56] that Genesis 1 126 man is that part of
[1:13:00] the
[1:13:02] them bride that's not foolish virgin
[1:13:06] that's not IM Isaiah Jeremiah
[1:13:09] Abraham it's only the redeemed the Born
[1:13:12] Again
[1:13:14] redeemed all right so you take that
[1:13:17] group of people and you put them in a
[1:13:19] place and you tell them say look you now
[1:13:22] have the divine power of God inside of
[1:13:25] your soul you are now a Christian you
[1:13:27] are now in line of adoption you're not
[1:13:30] adopted but you're in line because look
[1:13:32] according as his divine power and who is
[1:13:34] divine there's only one Divine there
[1:13:36] ain't a Divine person on Earth ex the
[1:13:39] bride you forgot her we can't forget the
[1:13:43] bride his divine power who Jesus Christ
[1:13:47] had given unto us oh so that divine
[1:13:49] power has been given to
[1:13:50] us has given unto us all all things that
[1:13:53] pertain on the life of godliness to the
[1:13:55] knowledge of him that hath called us to
[1:13:57] glory and virtue whereby are given unto
[1:13:59] us exceeding great and precious promises
[1:14:02] brother Ram said that by these promises
[1:14:04] that by these you might be partakers of
[1:14:07] the divine
[1:14:09] nature right having escaped the
[1:14:11] corruption that is in the world through
[1:14:12] lust so we don't have to go to
[1:14:15] judgment the lust of the World by the
[1:14:17] new birth is not in your
[1:14:22] soul
[1:14:24] we could say something about that but
[1:14:26] I'm not going to say anything right now
[1:14:27] all right so the word divine means Theos
[1:14:29] which is the godhead of Christ spoken of
[1:14:32] the only and true God whatever can in
[1:14:35] any respect be likened to God
[1:14:37] now Jesus didn't liking us to
[1:14:40] God he said if we'll do what he says we
[1:14:43] be
[1:14:45] God right that we may be
[1:14:49] one as I and the father are one they be
[1:14:53] one all right Romans 8:14 for many as
[1:14:57] are led by the spirit of God they are
[1:14:59] the sons of God in other words you
[1:15:00] receive the divine nature of God after
[1:15:02] the New Birth all right but you have
[1:15:05] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[1:15:07] we cry daddy daddy Our Father father the
[1:15:11] spirit itself bearing witness with our
[1:15:13] spirit now look that we are the children
[1:15:15] of God there's come a time and place
[1:15:16] where you got to settle the
[1:15:18] settlement I am a child of God or I'm
[1:15:22] not all
[1:15:24] right cuz listen once you see that
[1:15:27] you're a child of
[1:15:29] God you get these promises of joint
[1:15:33] Airship with Christ cuz that's what
[1:15:35] Christ was doing in St John 17 he said
[1:15:38] look whatever I got give it to
[1:15:41] them but they will be a group that'll be
[1:15:43] Sanctified separate from that that'll
[1:15:46] get me and its
[1:15:48] fullness everybody with me if so be that
[1:15:51] we suffer with him so it's not going to
[1:15:53] be easy or even
[1:15:56] pretty had a girl today at work
[1:16:00] Kelly her hair's getting down about this
[1:16:04] long she said I just can't stand it when
[1:16:06] my hair touches my shoulders I said well
[1:16:11] June can stand when her hair touches the
[1:16:13] back of her leg at the bottom and I said
[1:16:15] sister Rachel y'all know her that's a
[1:16:17] little Rose girl that that that ships
[1:16:20] all that stuff hers touches the ground
[1:16:24] she's never cut her hair
[1:16:27] what I know y'all believe different no I
[1:16:29] said we believe the
[1:16:32] Bible I said we don't we don't worry
[1:16:34] about our sister don't worry about where
[1:16:35] their hair touches she was she was it
[1:16:38] was bothering her you because it was on
[1:16:39] her shoulder it never been that alone
[1:16:42] before so anyway but see that's the
[1:16:44] thought process of the
[1:16:46] world our thought process is sisters I
[1:16:48] know it's tough to do your
[1:16:50] hair not when it gets thin and
[1:16:56] when Jun was having her surgery and all
[1:16:58] I kind of washed her hair over the sink
[1:17:00] and stuff you know and I thought man
[1:17:03] it's like a Chia Pet you know in your
[1:17:06] hand
[1:17:07] but and and then like brother Donnie
[1:17:09] Reagan you know if if somebody out in
[1:17:11] the world you know somebody comes says
[1:17:12] oh man I got one of my wife's hairs and
[1:17:14] they go oh well no we're like nope I got
[1:17:17] one of my wife's hair stuck in my
[1:17:20] shirt yeah it's all for the it's all for
[1:17:24] what the Bible says all right I said I
[1:17:28] said Kelly the Bible tells you not to do
[1:17:30] it I said it's not me saying or our
[1:17:32] religion saying that the Bible tells you
[1:17:35] not to do that of course all them other
[1:17:37] women in the in the post office they
[1:17:39] head back toward the
[1:17:42] back and Kelly blessed her heart she's a
[1:17:44] she's a she's about a 2third contic
[1:17:48] Yankee she just stood there and took it
[1:17:51] the rest of them buddy they just
[1:17:54] go back and sit down in the in the
[1:17:56] kitchen back in the back wait till I get
[1:17:58] done then they come
[1:17:59] out why cuz it's
[1:18:02] condemnation you sisters when if
[1:18:04] somebody preaches and says it's
[1:18:07] Abomination for you to cut your hair now
[1:18:09] if you've never cut your hair you're
[1:18:11] like a ain't talking to me and there's
[1:18:14] no
[1:18:15] condemnation but if you've trimmed your
[1:18:19] hair you don't need a lot of discernment
[1:18:21] when you start talking about hair in the
[1:18:23] and
[1:18:25] go they go off in that little safe
[1:18:32] place praise the Lord
[1:18:37] anyhow you know you just tell the people
[1:18:39] say look I can see in the Bible where
[1:18:42] we're not supposed
[1:18:44] to show me where it says you
[1:18:48] can if you're and she's not even a Bible
[1:18:51] believer I mean she probably never even
[1:18:52] opened a the book they were Catholics
[1:18:54] she said Catholic by name so they were
[1:18:56] just name Catholics so she probably
[1:18:58] didn't even know where the Bible said
[1:18:59] that she wasn't supposed to do that so
[1:19:03] but still just just say hey we're doing
[1:19:05] what the Bible says I don't know whether
[1:19:07] you think we've got this awkward
[1:19:08] religion or this we're over here on this
[1:19:11] no Bible tells you not to do it and it's
[1:19:13] Abomination for you to do it tell me
[1:19:15] where somebody told you you could do
[1:19:18] it it had to be your
[1:19:20] denomination because it wasn't God
[1:19:23] all right and then they start on the
[1:19:26] dress thing you know well that's in the
[1:19:27] Old Testament well why you got the Ten
[1:19:29] Commandments in your
[1:19:31] yard that's Old
[1:19:33] Testament so anyway you got the devil's
[1:19:36] answer not calling him a devil but
[1:19:38] there's one inside of them if they're
[1:19:40] not born again you know that's really
[1:19:42] the devil speaking when when you when
[1:19:44] you get somebody upset and they're not
[1:19:46] they're not a Christian that's not them
[1:19:49] cuz any other time normally you're
[1:19:50] sitting there drinking coffee and
[1:19:52] talking to them but you start you you
[1:19:54] you bump that soul and give them a
[1:19:56] little
[1:19:59] condemnation the burner comes
[1:20:02] on it's not them cuz it's the same
[1:20:04] person that was sitting there laughing
[1:20:05] and talking to you about football or or
[1:20:07] hunting or whatever it is then all of a
[1:20:09] sudden you get on religion and when it
[1:20:11] ain't got nowhere to go it really is
[1:20:15] bad do like me chase
[1:20:18] them I'm going back to Kitchen next time
[1:20:20] we talk about that wherefore laying
[1:20:23] aside all malice all Gile and hypocrisy
[1:20:25] and enies and evil speaking look as a
[1:20:27] newborn baby so we should be getting rid
[1:20:29] of that stuff right
[1:20:30] there at the new
[1:20:33] birth as newborn
[1:20:35] babies desire the sincere milk of the
[1:20:38] word that we may grow thereby a baby
[1:20:41] depends on you to feed
[1:20:42] it right all right but now um um and
[1:20:47] that is
[1:20:48] good but you can't stay that way because
[1:20:52] you got you got to come to a place where
[1:20:53] you study for
[1:20:54] yourself you got to come to a place
[1:20:56] where you eat food when you need
[1:21:00] food am I making any sense you just got
[1:21:03] to look at your kid look at kids kids
[1:21:06] growing up they're just like I said you
[1:21:08] put lay a baby right here the baby will
[1:21:09] fall straight off in the floor but you
[1:21:11] put a cat here and a little baby cat
[1:21:13] will'll never do that it'll look down
[1:21:14] there but it'll never get off but that
[1:21:16] baby will just go fall why they're a
[1:21:18] newborn baby they've not developed even
[1:21:21] though they got a soul they're not
[1:21:22] developed well listen at the new birth
[1:21:24] you get the soul of God right you're not
[1:21:26] fully developed though and God knows
[1:21:29] that that's why he came and prayed that
[1:21:33] prayer he said hold them Lord keep them
[1:21:37] don't take them out of the world but
[1:21:39] keep them in the world but keep the
[1:21:40] world away from them in other words
[1:21:42] coming
[1:21:44] inside so God knows we're all going to
[1:21:46] start off his babies and listen he's
[1:21:48] your biggest
[1:21:51] cheerleader he he's your biggest
[1:21:53] cheerleader come on come on come
[1:21:55] on and not the
[1:21:58] devil as newborn babies desire in a
[1:22:00] sense of milk of the word that you look
[1:22:02] that you may grow now listen babies
[1:22:04] drink milk and they

[1:22:50] his life talking about look when a man
[1:22:51] is Born Again of the the spirit of God
[1:22:54] God gives him a checkbook that'll last
[1:22:55] him through his life's journey and at
[1:22:58] the bottom of each check has got Jesus's
[1:23:00] name on it and you just fill it out for

[1:23:14] your salvation all right so that's in
[1:23:17] the soul so now we're coming out to the
[1:23:19] spirit realm which is second Peter 1
[1:23:21] ver5 and beside Bes this what in other
[1:23:23] words besides all this we've been

[1:24:29] of that that's like
[1:24:31] us when you're a newborn babe you're you
[1:24:33] have a narrow sense of what God is now
[1:24:36] am I not am I telling the truth when you
[1:24:38] get born again listen your whole nature
[1:24:42] part of you is contrary to God it is so
[1:24:44] contrary to God it's not of God until
[1:24:46] God comes
[1:24:48] inside but remember he goes through that
[1:24:50] developmental stage where he takes your
[1:24:51] Stony heart out and he gives you a new
[1:24:53] heart and he softens you up a little bit
[1:24:55] then when he gives you the Holy Ghost
[1:24:57] you're still sitting there going what's
[1:24:59] next what's next feed me Lord all right
[1:25:04] that's why coming to church is
[1:25:06] important you can believe it or not but
[1:25:08] you can't get fed at home you got to
[1:25:11] come to the
[1:25:12] buffet all right and you will if you're
[1:25:15] born
[1:25:16] again I like what brother darl Ward said
[1:25:18] he said you don't have to preach to
[1:25:19] Christians to get them to come to church
[1:25:26] cuz I want a
[1:25:28] buffet I come looking for something
[1:25:30] goody
[1:25:32] ribs
[1:25:35] steak I mean Deer
[1:25:38] Lodge Danny dear Lodge brother Danny
[1:25:42] right I'm inan a state that hangs over
[1:25:44] the plate like
[1:25:46] Murphy now we getting big time right
[1:25:48] there buddy that's a
[1:25:51] Capstone
[1:25:54] there's two good things in Oklahoma
[1:25:56] Murphy's and brother Claude and his
[1:25:58] church that's about
[1:26:01] it but if you desire the Sensei of milk
[1:26:04] of the word listen if you desire that
[1:26:05] it's going to take you to the buffet
[1:26:07] it's going to take
[1:26:09] you now whether you eat it or not you
[1:26:11] can go stand at that buffet and say man
[1:26:13] this looks
[1:26:15] good remember though you've got the
[1:26:17] check to pay for
[1:26:19] it it's already signed don't matter how
[1:26:22] much that Buffet cost Jesus signed it go
[1:26:25] get it right everybody with me but
[1:26:29] besides this giving all diligence in
[1:26:31] other words like I said as a baby a baby
[1:26:34] lays in the crib or you let it run
[1:26:35] around on the floor but when when Jonas
[1:26:38] or Luke goes in that Buffet line and and
[1:26:40] Zach black if he was here I can imagine
[1:26:42] him going through and and
[1:26:46] Michael brother Michael in a buffet
[1:26:50] line but when he was a little baby it
[1:26:52] didn't bother him but it was still there
[1:26:55] right the buffet was still there it was
[1:26:58] for the people that had become of age
[1:26:59] more and you know before that but here
[1:27:02] they come and they're going to be
[1:27:03] diligent about getting in line you
[1:27:04] better get out of the way right so
[1:27:07] that's the way we should be as
[1:27:08] Christians we should hey get out of my
[1:27:09] way remember my old football coach he
[1:27:11] said either lead follow or get out of
[1:27:13] the way don't stand in somebody's way if
[1:27:14] you can't get it if you can't go
[1:27:15] yourself and Lead get out of the way and
[1:27:17] let somebody go through there get in
[1:27:19] that Buffet
[1:27:21] line this word of God should mean more
[1:27:24] now to you than ever before if it
[1:27:29] doesn't something's wrong you're right
[1:27:33] malnourished if you're malnourished
[1:27:34] because of the word of God it's your
[1:27:36] fault you know where to get
[1:27:39] it and besides this besides New Birth
[1:27:42] besides starting coming to church and
[1:27:44] reading your Bible and praying to the
[1:27:46] Lord and the Lord answering your prayer
[1:27:48] and and and having faith that God will
[1:27:50] do things you got to add some things
[1:27:52] things to it right which would be virtue
[1:27:54] knowledge Temperance and that emanates
[1:27:56] out of your soul it's already in there
[1:27:57] it just emanates out of your soul into
[1:28:00] your spirit because your spirit realm
[1:28:01] didn't get the new
[1:28:05] birth no I
[1:28:07] wished I wished but it didn't there's
[1:28:10] the playground that's the battle listen
[1:28:13] the battle is not in your in your flesh
[1:28:15] excuse me the battle's not in your flesh
[1:28:18] the battle is in your mind your
[1:28:20] reasoning your conscious affs and
[1:28:23] Imagination that's where the realm that
[1:28:25] he's God is trying to get these virtues
[1:28:29] put in as brother Ry says the Lord goes
[1:28:32] into your door you allowed him in allow
[1:28:34] him into your room but you got doors
[1:28:35] that are
[1:28:37] closed and he won't go in them because
[1:28:39] he's timid he's a gentleman you've got
[1:28:41] to open the door and he calls them all
[1:28:44] out Pride selfishness all the different
[1:28:46] things that's contrary to this all right
[1:28:49] but what does he want to give you who
[1:28:50] wants to give you these all right right
[1:28:52] and to knowledge Temperance Temperance
[1:28:54] patience patience godliness to Godliness
[1:28:55] brotherly kindness to brotherly kindness
[1:28:58] charity Ephesians 4:14 say that we
[1:29:01] henceforth be no more children all right
[1:29:05] we get in the spirit realm we start up
[1:29:06] the statue of perfect man we will not be
[1:29:09] children if you're if you're climbing up
[1:29:11] that statue of perfect man you're not a
[1:29:13] child anymore all right look tossed to
[1:29:16] and
[1:29:17] fro and carried about with every wind of
[1:29:20] Doctrine by the glot of men and cunning
[1:29:23] craftiness whereby they lying weight to
[1:29:25] deceive preachers but speaking the truth
[1:29:28] in love may grow up into him look in all
[1:29:33] things there's a promise in all
[1:29:36] things which is the head even Christ 1
[1:29:39] Peter 2 vers1 you also as Lively stones
[1:29:42] are built up a spiritual house a holy
[1:29:45] priesthood to offer up spiritual
[1:29:47] sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus
[1:29:50] Christ wherefore also show is contained
[1:29:52] in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a
[1:29:54] chief what a Chief
[1:29:56] Cornerstone down here corner Cornerstone
[1:30:00] not headstone
[1:30:02] Cornerstone elect precious and he that
[1:30:05] believeth on him shall not be what
[1:30:09] confounded unto you therefore which
[1:30:12] believe he is precious but them which be
[1:30:15] disobedient the stone which the Builder
[1:30:17] disallowed the same is made the head of
[1:30:19] the corner which he tells where it's at
[1:30:21] but it's made a stone of stumbling and a
[1:30:23] rock of
[1:30:24] offense even to them which stumble look
[1:30:27] at the
[1:30:28] word why being
[1:30:33] disobedient I got a quote down here
[1:30:34] probably not going to get to it where
[1:30:35] brother R says bottom line is
[1:30:41] obedience obedience to the word of God I
[1:30:44] may try to get to that for we we'll get
[1:30:46] ready we'll get done here in just a
[1:30:48] second but you are a chosen generation a
[1:30:52] royal priesthood a holy nation of
[1:30:54] peculiar people that you should show
[1:30:56] forth the Praises of him that called you
[1:30:57] out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light
[1:30:59] now listen there's a group of people
[1:31:00] that did
[1:31:02] that first church AE second third fourth
[1:31:04] fifth six part of seventh they're gone
[1:31:07] already they can't Manifest this
[1:31:09] anymore they were a chosen
[1:31:14] generation but you and I are this part
[1:31:17] now we're alive we're Lively Stones yes
[1:31:22] which in times past were not a
[1:31:25] people but are now the people of God
[1:31:29] which had not obtained Mercy but now
[1:31:32] have obtained Mercy 1 Peter 1:22 says
[1:31:35] seeing you look seeing you have purified
[1:31:37] your souls and obeying the truth through
[1:31:40] the spirit under unfeigned love of the
[1:31:42] Brethren see that you love one another
[1:31:44] with a pure heart fervently being born
[1:31:46] again not of corruptible seed so you
[1:31:49] cannot get you can't grow in God with
[1:31:52] corruptible seed cuz listen God hates
[1:31:54] that
[1:31:55] stuff did he not say he hated the Deeds
[1:31:57] of nians and he said he hated it he
[1:31:59] didn't say he didn't like it he hated it
[1:32:02] being born again not of corruptible seed
[1:32:03] but of Incorruptible by what by the word
[1:32:05] of God which liveth and abideth forever
[1:32:09] Hebrews 5:10 says called of God and high
[1:32:11] priest after the order of MDC of whom we
[1:32:15] have so many things to say and hard to
[1:32:16] be uttered look seeing you are dull of
[1:32:19] hearing this is Paul talking to a con
[1:32:22] congregation and you think we're rough
[1:32:24] every once in a while you ain't
[1:32:26] listening you ain't getting this you're
[1:32:27] dull of hearing for when for the time
[1:32:29] you ought to be teachers you have need
[1:32:32] that one teach you again which be the
[1:32:34] first principles of the Oracles of God
[1:32:37] which is you must be born again and all
[1:32:41] that other that goes with
[1:32:44] it and I know I know for a fact there's
[1:32:47] no way that every church member is going
[1:32:50] to be born again
[1:32:52] I hate that but you have to go back to
[1:32:55] what brother Brown said he he said in
[1:32:57] every congregation that's why I don't
[1:32:58] like small congregations and I in them
[1:33:01] he said he says there's M Believers M
[1:33:03] Believers and unbelievers right in every
[1:33:06] congregation so if there's three people
[1:33:12] there but if they're there but listen if
[1:33:16] you're conscious of that if this is
[1:33:18] bothering you to come to church and
[1:33:19] listen to a message you need to get born
[1:33:23] again or need to grow you need to grow a
[1:33:26] little more say God I need to grow a
[1:33:28] little more I still say God and need
[1:33:29] listen we're going to actually ask God
[1:33:32] to grow a little more the day of the
[1:33:35] change right for when for the time you
[1:33:38] ought to be teachers you have need that
[1:33:40] one teach you again which be the first
[1:33:41] principles of the Oracles of God in
[1:33:43] other words we got to back up and talk
[1:33:45] about a new birth cuz we got new people
[1:33:47] come in then we going up a little higher
[1:33:49] then we have to back up a little bit cuz
[1:33:50] we got new people come in or somebody
[1:33:53] that's really hadn't been seeking it now
[1:33:56] seeking it but you have to discern that
[1:34:00] um through prayer and and U just
[1:34:02] watching people you can really see that
[1:34:04] and are become such as have need of milk
[1:34:06] and not of strong meat for everyone that
[1:34:08] uses milk look is unskillful listen you
[1:34:11] get the
[1:34:13] checkbook with Jesus's name on it when
[1:34:15] you're born again but you are still
[1:34:19] unskillful or he would give it to you
[1:34:21] blank and you put your name on it so he
[1:34:25] makes sure that you don't make a real
[1:34:26] bad boo boo he gives you a check puts
[1:34:29] his name on it so he can back it
[1:34:32] up for everyone that uses milk is
[1:34:35] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[1:34:37] for he is a babe but strong meat belongs
[1:34:40] to them that are of full age even those
[1:34:43] who by look by reason of
[1:34:45] use have their senses where are your
[1:34:48] senses you only got one in the middle
[1:34:51] you you're either born again or not you
[1:34:53] got five in the second realm
[1:34:56] senses and you got five out
[1:34:59] here having their senses exercised to
[1:35:03] discern both good and evil you have
[1:35:06] discernment to do that Ephesians 4 1:4
[1:35:10] said according as he has chosen Us in
[1:35:11] him before the foundation of the world
[1:35:13] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[1:35:15] before him in love I I brother Dale
[1:35:18] broke this down years and years ago and
[1:35:20] I still got it in my Bible cuz look at
[1:35:23] this point of the journey you're not
[1:35:25] holy and you're not without
[1:35:32] blame but he says that we should be holy
[1:35:35] and Without Blame before him in love
[1:35:37] that's what God saw before the
[1:35:38] foundation of the
[1:35:39] world then we had to come down here by
[1:35:42] predetermining or predestined Us by
[1:35:45] seeing by for knowledge that there would
[1:35:47] be a group of people that would come to
[1:35:49] adoption by Jesus Jesus Christ to
[1:35:52] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:35:55] of his will now brother Bri right here I
[1:35:57] guess we'll stop right here again
[1:35:58] musicians come on now what is adoption
[1:36:01] now let me get this now I don't know
[1:36:03] whether I won't have time to get through
[1:36:04] this and he keeps going he says look
[1:36:07] here's another time now you watch
[1:36:08] brother brandham brother brandham is a
[1:36:10] restorer of the word but being a Resto
[1:36:13] of the word he has to use the sword to
[1:36:17] divide I just read you Ephesians 4
[1:36:21] rightly dividing the word of Truth Now
[1:36:24] look brother R says look your adoption
[1:36:26] is not your
[1:36:28] birth all right so he divided it right
[1:36:31] there your adoption is not your birth
[1:36:34] you can be born again and not come to
[1:36:36] adoption but you can't come to adoption
[1:36:38] without being born again all
[1:36:40] right you're in line you have the full
[1:36:43] potential to do it but you can stop
[1:36:46] it if you don't think you're your worst
[1:36:48] enemy then blame me
[1:36:53] thank you but you're your worst enemy
[1:36:55] I'm my worst
[1:36:56] enemy
[1:36:58] amen but your adoption is not your birth
[1:37:00] your adoption is your placing now we'll
[1:37:02] start talk we're going I've been trying
[1:37:04] to get this for two weeks but keep going
[1:37:06] back adding a piece I want you to see
[1:37:08] what your placing is cuz your adoption
[1:37:10] is your placing what does he mean by
[1:37:12] placing like chest pieces on a chest
[1:37:16] board we'll talk about that but we were
[1:37:19] predestinated to
[1:37:21] adoption all right look now look when
[1:37:24] you were born again St John
[1:37:26] 1:17 I believe when you are born again
[1:37:29] of the spirit of God we are the sons of
[1:37:31] God all right we're born
[1:37:33] again but we were predestinated now what
[1:37:37] we predestinated
[1:37:38] to
[1:37:40] adoption no other group no other age
[1:37:43] could come to adoption except this
[1:37:49] age let me read this real quick
[1:37:51] everybody
[1:37:52] stand now we went through second Peter 1
[1:37:55] he's talking about the divine nature of
[1:37:57] God receiving the new birth is everybody
[1:37:59] with me receiving the the the the new
[1:38:02] birth and then besides this right add to
[1:38:05] your faith virtue knowledge temper
[1:38:07] patience now look now we're at this part
[1:38:09] this is the adoption part look for if
[1:38:11] these things be in you they weren't in
[1:38:13] you to begin
[1:38:14] with hello they weren't in you to begin
[1:38:17] with for if these things be in you and
[1:38:20] abound they make you they'll make you do
[1:38:23] things you really didn't do when you
[1:38:25] were a little kid they make you that you
[1:38:28] shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful
[1:38:31] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[1:38:33] Christ look but he that lath these
[1:38:34] things is
[1:38:36] blind
[1:38:38] Christians there's no one worse than a
[1:38:40] blind
[1:38:41] Christian but he that lath these things
[1:38:44] is blind but where are you blind at
[1:38:46] you're blind by letting your memory
[1:38:48] reason conscious affection and
[1:38:49] Imagination take over that Faith that's
[1:38:52] supposed to be building up inside you
[1:38:53] that says hey I can do all things
[1:38:55] through Christ who strengthens me but he
[1:38:58] that lack at these things is blind look
[1:39:00] and cannot see it far off cut your
[1:39:02] Revelation right off and has forgotten
[1:39:06] that he was purged from his old
[1:39:08] sin wherefore the rather Brethren give
[1:39:11] diligence he said that three times in
[1:39:14] this verse one through about 12 give
[1:39:17] diligence to make your calling and
[1:39:19] election sure there's your placing
[1:39:22] we'll talk about it for if you do these
[1:39:25] things you shall never
[1:39:28] fall what a promise you shall never
[1:39:32] fall for as so an entrance shall be
[1:39:34] ministered unto you what through the
[1:39:37] gospel a door
[1:39:39] open unto you abundantly into the
[1:39:42] Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and
[1:39:43] Savior Jesus Christ wherefore I will not
[1:39:46] be negligent to put you always in

[1:42:52] somewhere in a trial there's got to be
[1:42:54] something that you realize hey this is
[1:42:56] for me I need this for some
[1:42:58] reason cuz I was telling somebody uh uh
[1:43:01] sister Audrey the other day I said God
[1:43:04] promised us he'd never put on us more
[1:43:06] than we can
[1:43:07] stand is that not is that Bible he said
[1:43:11] promised us he said I'll never put more
[1:43:13] on you than you can stand we just don't
[1:43:15] know how much we can
[1:43:16] stand until he does put us to a through
[1:43:19] a trial and we say oh I can stand that
[1:43:22] or if I can't stand it I better get some
[1:43:25] praying and some reading and some
[1:43:26] studying and some counseling and some
[1:43:28] talking and and talk to the master and
[1:43:31] and ask him hey where am I missing it
[1:43:34] at that's what I listen All Those Years
[1:43:37] brother Dale sat and I sat right there
[1:43:39] where Donnie's satting I'm like Lord put
[1:43:41] the pieces together for
[1:43:44] me put the pieces get it from me I'm
[1:43:47] selfish you can get it if you want to
[1:43:49] put the pieces together for me I was
[1:43:52] telling you U brother Harris was
[1:43:54] preaching here one night and I sitting
[1:43:55] there and I had a bunch of questions on
[1:43:58] predestination and he wasn't even
[1:43:59] preaching on predestination but he hit a
[1:44:01] little something about adoption or or
[1:44:04] predes predestined or something he said
[1:44:06] that word and I never had it happen
[1:44:09] before but I just looked up and right
[1:44:11] here a book
[1:44:12] opened and like it folded open and there
[1:44:15] was the whole forn knowledge
[1:44:19] predetermined predestined ation all down
[1:44:22] the line it was just it just come to me
[1:44:24] and written right straight out and put
[1:44:26] it every bit right straight together I
[1:44:28] never had that happen before but but
[1:44:31] when you do have that happen you know
[1:44:33] what that is that's that portal that
[1:44:34] opens up remember brother Dell told us
[1:44:36] he said when you get a revelation or you
[1:44:38] get something from God my children he
[1:44:41] said because God's real close God's real
[1:44:44] close right then if he's G you a
[1:44:45] revelation you sure know it ain't the
[1:44:47] devil so God's more prevalent right then
[1:44:50] than just say hey father why you in the
[1:44:53] house why you in the
[1:44:55] house why you here I need something I
[1:44:58] need my kids
[1:45:03] safe there's more going on in that
[1:45:05] Dimension than this Dimension but
[1:45:07] sometimes that Dimension kind of Breaks
[1:45:10] Loose a little bit and you get a
[1:45:12] revelation or God gives you something
[1:45:14] you go man like St John 17 I was saying
[1:45:17] today I thought now Lord there's
[1:45:19] something in here where you you pulled
[1:45:20] it apart and then you put it back
[1:45:22] together he said you like St John 17
[1:45:25] right so I just flipped right to it and
[1:45:27] started reading it and I said well
[1:45:28] that's what Jesus stood there and
[1:45:29] praying you know I mean this is like
[1:45:32] like Daddy said you know he wasn't
[1:45:33] talking to the
[1:45:36] secretary he's talking to the father
[1:45:38] about me and you so now I can put my
[1:45:41] faith in that that it didn't get through
[1:45:43] a secretary that had two or three
[1:45:44] different meanings to it
[1:45:48] and that was his words praying for us
[1:45:51] his words knowing that a group of people
[1:45:54] would come to adoption that would come
[1:45:56] and would need that
[1:45:59] prayer that's why he prayed it he knew
[1:46:01] we'd need it he said save them
[1:46:04] Father keep them in the
[1:46:06] world but keep them
[1:46:09] Sanctified trust trust the Lord trust
[1:46:12] the Lord amen let's bow our heads Lord
