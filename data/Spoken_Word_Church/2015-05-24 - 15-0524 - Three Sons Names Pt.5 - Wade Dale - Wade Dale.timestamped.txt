[0:00] all right Victor I hope we
[0:05] we kind of you know did all the
[0:08] background in last Sunday afternoon
[0:12] but uh
[0:14] several of the ones that were not down
[0:16] here we really enjoyed it because they
[0:18] had not heard it before so
[0:20] we got some good comments about but
[0:22] this person that we're talking about
[0:24] this logos
[0:26] to me that logos
[0:28] is
[0:33] I want to say the most important there's
[0:36] not a most important in God but for
[0:38] understanding purposes to understand God
[0:41] the logos is the most important to me he
[0:45] said well it's not a man well the son of
[0:46] man was another manifestation it was the
[0:48] logos in that man so it's all and then
[0:51] you say well while the Son of God well
[0:54] that is the Son of God you know so so
[0:57] the logos is what carries all the way
[0:59] down through
[1:01] and when Jesus said I come from God and
[1:03] I go back to God I come from logos I go
[1:05] back to logos all right so and I was
[1:08] talking to uh somebody yesterday I mean
[1:11] bro Martin yeah brother marks this
[1:13] thing's not working again
[1:16] um
[1:22] hello working now
[1:24] I'm talking to brother Mark yesterday
[1:25] night when we talked when we think about
[1:28] logos don't think that the logos is some
[1:31] you know God just comes out and he's
[1:33] he's just you know he's just like you
[1:36] know you see ghosts in the in movies you
[1:38] know and there there's no there's no the
[1:41] form is just you barely see them and
[1:44] they don't look clear no this was a man
[1:47] this logos was a man this one he had
[1:50] substance he said was he in flesh listen
[1:54] that part I'm still studying because
[1:56] when brother Brown went across the
[1:57] curtain a time they were in some kind of
[2:00] Flesh they weren't spirits
[2:02] to stay like Casper the Friendly Ghost
[2:04] because remember brother Branham in his
[2:06] early Ministry and he said I'll be on a
[2:08] cloud floating by he said I can't shake
[2:10] brother Neville's hand because see he
[2:12] thought there was nothing there was when
[2:14] you think of spirit you think of
[2:15] something that walked through the wall
[2:17] now remember Jesus walked through the
[2:19] wall after his resurrection and he was
[2:22] in a flesh body glorified flesh body
[2:25] right
[2:27] right that's hard to understand
[2:30] but he just reached right on through the
[2:32] wall walked right on through and it
[2:33] didn't even bother him you know didn't
[2:34] bother anything and when brother Brandon
[2:37] went across the curtain a time that was
[2:38] probably one of the most striking things
[2:40] that that came to him was number one
[2:42] they were in all their senses
[2:44] and number two they were in some form
[2:47] you say well is it flesh
[2:50] no it's not the flesh they lived in down
[2:52] here obviously but it is something
[2:53] that's got some substance because when
[2:55] he hugged those women he said they have
[2:56] breasts so there was a form when they
[3:00] hugged him there was something hug him
[3:03] it wasn't that they went like this and
[3:06] you know right when they he said they
[3:09] were real to me that's the most real
[3:11] part of you is that part yeah that's
[3:14] what I've always said about Paul when
[3:16] when man chopped Paul's head off he
[3:18] didn't have to pick his theophany head
[3:19] up when he went across in the sixth
[3:21] Dimension he didn't have to go looking
[3:22] for his head and put it back on no he
[3:25] just he just
[3:26] disconnected from this body and stepped
[3:29] over into that sixth Dimension that
[3:31] theophany being more real or stronger
[3:34] than this body all right that you see
[3:36] here but remember there is some when we
[3:39] say a form of God it's not a form that
[3:42] you look and it's real fuzzy and that's
[3:45] man's idea of what a ghost is or or a
[3:48] spirit when we say God is a spirit we
[3:50] first thing we think of is we go well
[3:52] you can see through him and
[3:55] now that's not true
[3:57] because remember in the Garden of Eden
[3:59] whatever form God was in he killed two
[4:03] animals
[4:04] ripped the skins off of their body and
[4:07] gave them to Adam and Eve so he was in
[4:10] some form of a
[4:14] I'm not gonna say flesh but I'm gonna I
[4:16] have my ideal now I just hadn't found
[4:18] any there's no quote where brother Brown
[4:21] said yeah your name but he was in some
[4:22] form that was
[4:23] hard enough to where he killed that lamb
[4:27] she's pulled and brother Brown said pull
[4:29] the skins off of that lamp he didn't
[4:31] just go all right Liam you die and God's
[4:34] not no he didn't do that Bible said and
[4:37] brother Brown said God
[4:39] pulled the skins off of those animals
[4:41] and give them to Adam and Eve Adam and
[4:43] Eve didn't do it God did it so there was
[4:45] some form of god so let's not look at
[4:47] this logos and look at the logos and say
[4:49] well it was some you know some floating
[4:52] ghost or even if he was in a form of a
[4:54] man no I believe he was a solid human
[4:57] being saying whatever you want to say it
[5:01] okay that's what he was
[5:04] he was gone if if Adam was made in His
[5:08] image
[5:10] what was he he's a man right okay so in
[5:14] the beginning was the word
[5:15] see remember Heaven and Earth will pass
[5:18] away
[5:19] now remember brother Brown remember when
[5:21] he goes in the future home when that
[5:22] word passed away pass away doesn't mean
[5:25] God's going to annihilate it right
[5:27] he's going to clean it off because
[5:30] remember it's part of the original
[5:31] creation uh my idea on this is like
[5:35] brother Dale said last week my
[5:36] Revelation on this Wednesday night my
[5:39] Revelation is is that everything that
[5:41] God created is going to stay here it's
[5:44] Eternal you say Earth
[5:49] all it's going to do is be cleaned off
[5:50] there's some part of this Earth that's
[5:52] that's the heat trans and eternal form
[5:54] to it
[5:55] if not then God would annihilate it and
[5:58] create a new one because the Bible says
[5:59] I created a new Heaven in A New Earth
[6:01] well then we had to have a Prophet come
[6:03] in
[6:04] go into that eagle anointing go up into
[6:06] the mind of God to really know that God
[6:09] didn't say I'm going to destroy the
[6:10] Heaven and Earth
[6:12] I'm just going to wipe the sin off just
[6:14] like me and you when you and I were born
[6:16] again he wiped the sin out of our life
[6:18] but
[6:19] same body okay and then it's this same
[6:23] body is going to be glorified because
[6:25] the Bible says those who he has
[6:26] Justified
[6:28] he's already glorified all right we just
[6:30] are not in that condition yet right
[6:33] because remember Jesus was slain before
[6:36] the foundation world I read it Sunday
[6:37] afternoon Jesus was slain before the
[6:39] foundation of the world right but he
[6:41] literally had to do it down here brother
[6:43] Brown said in God's mind it was already
[6:45] over right but it had to come down here
[6:48] and take on this because this is what he
[6:51] put Adam and Eve in and they fell
[6:53] okay so in the beginning was the word
[6:55] the word was with God and the Word was
[6:57] God
[6:59] that doesn't anymore explaining
[7:01] in the beginning was this logo the logos
[7:05] was with God
[7:07] because it was a part of God
[7:10] and the Word was God
[7:13] so the logos was
[7:15] God
[7:16] period
[7:18] but in that logos like I said about the
[7:21] logo you can say McDonald's period
[7:24] well in your mind
[7:26] in my mind if you wrote down everything
[7:28] we thought about McDonald's from the
[7:30] beginning if you went back through
[7:31] history but see you got to go through
[7:32] every day I was thinking yesterday you
[7:35] know how great God is and we can't
[7:36] understand him I was eating cashew
[7:39] out of a can
[7:41] and I put that cashew in my hand and I
[7:43] said God you knew you can take me back
[7:45] and show me the soil that this came out
[7:47] of
[7:49] oh you think you think you can
[7:52] I really could if you listen to Who's
[7:55] That Smell Casey like brother Dale said
[7:57] last night we were listening to him he
[7:58] said God is infinite that means he has
[8:01] no limitation that's right
[8:03] if I could take that one
[8:06] cashew that I'm getting ready to eat
[8:08] and God could go all the way back to the
[8:11] very soil that it came out of tell you
[8:14] what soil came up through what plant
[8:16] when they picked it and harvested it
[8:17] where it went and then it came to me
[8:20] that's just a piece of cashew what about
[8:22] everything we do anything we do God Is
[8:24] So in is infinite so how are we going to
[8:26] understand that right how are we going
[8:28] to understand but now remember watch
[8:31] this this was my next thought if we as
[8:34] humans got into God's Laboratory
[8:38] we actually didn't break into God's
[8:41] Laboratory
[8:43] you can't break into God
[8:45] allowed man through his intelligence his
[8:48] knowledge his human knowledge he has
[8:51] allowed because remember even in a
[8:53] fallen condition where God
[8:55] right brother I'm saying even a sinner
[8:58] is a Son of God by birth by natural
[9:00] birth so you have in your brain we only
[9:05] use 10 of it some of us more some of us
[9:08] less
[9:08] some of us brother raise them up just
[9:11] ain't gone
[9:11] thank you man I'm talking about me I'm
[9:14] talking about me oh you talking about
[9:16] you but what if we could use if we only
[9:19] use 10 and you see this what about if we
[9:22] used a hundred percent of our brain
[9:23] capacity what we could do
[9:26] Manhattan some men have have
[9:28] photographic memories where they can
[9:30] look at a page and then two days later
[9:31] in his brain he can bring it right back
[9:33] up and it looks just like that page to
[9:34] be read somebody like Albert Einstein
[9:36] was just so smart but what about God
[9:38] though but what about this
[9:41] I was I was looking at that at that
[9:43] cashew and I said well
[9:46] if you took this to a laboratory
[9:49] man could tell you the same thing
[9:51] man could take that back to and and
[9:54] through all their process of of
[9:57] chemicals they could run it back and at
[9:59] least tell you what field it came out of
[10:00] so see God God is is known that's
[10:04] talking to Mark brother Mark yesterday
[10:05] God is only known by what we know here
[10:09] isn't that right that's why we'll have a
[10:11] message to cheer when all this cloud of
[10:13] junk
[10:14] and we can use a hundred percent of our
[10:16] brain and it's the Mind literally the
[10:18] mind of God you say Liberty yeah I
[10:19] believe it's going to be literally mind
[10:20] of God
[10:21] comes to you in no limitation then we'll
[10:24] have a message of cheer that's when God
[10:26] will completely unfold but down here
[10:28] we're still limited Jesus was limited by
[10:30] his human brain right right he had to he
[10:34] had to do things humanly because he was
[10:36] in a human body yeah he had a human
[10:38] brain
[10:41] right but the god the logos was living
[10:44] in that in that body telling it what to
[10:47] do so man has
[10:49] actually a Satan Satan has imitated God
[10:52] but he can't create well that's what I
[10:54] was thinking I looked at that cashier
[10:56] and I said well man can take it back so
[10:59] far
[11:00] but they can't take nothing
[11:04] that's what um
[11:06] my brother told me one time he said you
[11:08] know gone man did break into God's
[11:11] laboratory or God allowed him to come
[11:12] into God's laboratory and the guy was
[11:14] using an analogy and it's kind of funny
[11:15] where a man walks up the guy and says we
[11:18] can do the same thing you do
[11:20] and then he turns to start to do
[11:21] something and God says okay you go ahead
[11:23] and said I want you to create it first
[11:27] I want you to create it first
[11:32] in other words he said no you can't use
[11:34] my creation right you got to create it
[11:36] first and then do what you need to do
[11:38] with it you can't use mine if you're
[11:40] going to be that kind of a god you can't
[11:42] use my creation you got to do the own
[11:44] creating and then you can go down but
[11:46] instead that's where man has to stop the
[11:48] only creative powers in God Almighty
[11:50] himself okay and we see that it was
[11:54] manifested in the squirrels and the
[11:56] things that brother Brown spoken to
[11:57] listen but that's just not for him
[11:59] that's for all of us that's for us
[12:01] to have the mind of God is to have the
[12:04] Creator that's right the logos the
[12:06] Creator and you say well when's it
[12:07] coming well it should have came right
[12:09] down here but our problem is in our
[12:11] spirit realm we clog up the clues and
[12:14] don't allow the Holy Spirit to work like
[12:16] it should at work but in the beginning
[12:18] was the logos and the logos was live God
[12:21] and the love us was God
[12:23] the same was in the beginning with God
[12:25] all things were made by him and without
[12:28] him was not anything made
[12:30] that was made in him was life and the
[12:33] life
[12:34] was a lion man all right and then what
[12:37] did that logos do that logos began to
[12:39] what created
[12:40] remember
[12:42] the difference in Us in God we can have
[12:44] a thought
[12:45] and it not develop that's right right we
[12:49] have a thought in our mind and it not
[12:51] develop or we have a thought in our mind
[12:53] about how we're going to go down this
[12:54] road here and then things change but
[12:57] remember when a thought comes in God's
[12:59] mind it immediately has to become to
[13:02] pass because
[13:04] he can have another thought brother
[13:06] Graham said he can't have another
[13:08] thought
[13:09] because his thoughts are Eternal his dog
[13:11] come right down from thought into speech
[13:13] and just just like that you know
[13:16] all right
[13:17] but remember we're going to cover this a
[13:19] little bit later when we get down to
[13:20] where the new birth coming into us later
[13:23] down the road
[13:24] by that Son of God is
[13:27] we have to be careful
[13:30] about
[13:32] you say well I have the mind of Christ
[13:34] or the mind of God that's right but you
[13:36] still have your human brain yeah you
[13:39] still got your Humanity even Jesus had
[13:42] the part of that brain that he had that
[13:45] was born from Mary
[13:47] not my will but thou will be done let
[13:50] this cup pass for me in other words the
[13:53] form that he was in as a human
[13:57] he wanted to live his body wanted to
[14:00] live right but he knew but what happened
[14:02] though our problem is is we go well we
[14:04] uh we don't want to die so we don't
[14:06] we're not going to do that
[14:07] right but Jesus there's no way he could
[14:10] overcome that there's no way he could he
[14:12] could because remember in the Garden of
[14:14] Eden is I mean in The Garden of
[14:15] Gethsemane kind of kind of strange and
[14:18] then the garden it it was overthrown and
[14:21] in the garden it was overcome yeah right
[14:23] in the Garden of Eden it was overthrown
[14:25] by Satan and The Garden of Gethsemane it
[14:27] was overcome but brother Ryan said he
[14:29] didn't overcome on the cross he overcame
[14:31] In The Garden of Gethsemane right that's
[14:33] where the devil's fought him at once he
[14:35] got through that he was finished it was
[14:37] done but what it was not his he yielded
[14:40] everything he was in other words listen
[14:42] to this
[14:43] he had no nature but the nature of God
[14:47] we have a human nature
[14:50] that we have to fight right
[14:53] I don't mean just tempted I mean fight
[14:55] we have to fight that part amen Jesus
[14:58] didn't have to fight that part of being
[15:00] born in sin Shaker than iniquity a
[15:03] spouse from his mother's womb a liar
[15:06] I don't uh
[15:09] I don't think Jesus did not have battle
[15:13] but it was Battle of Satan trying to get
[15:15] in remember Satan's already in him
[15:19] that's right with us he then he got the
[15:22] brain God got the heart if God's down
[15:24] here Satan's still up here all right so
[15:27] and that's not really getting on the
[15:29] logos but it is that Logan said was
[15:31] standing there that said let there be
[15:33] remember all that was in
[15:35] Batman the called the logos or the or
[15:39] the word
[15:40] with everything that we need as human
[15:43] beings
[15:45] that's why I said the logos is very
[15:47] important because see now we can
[15:48] understand and as we as we look at like
[15:51] we're talking about McDonald's
[15:52] McDonald's isn't it is 75 years old it's
[15:56] a week to write everything about that
[15:58] logo
[15:59] if we wrote every day they sold how many
[16:01] billions and billions of hamburgers we'd
[16:04] have to write him one of them now they
[16:05] put the pickles in you understand what
[16:06] I'm saying if you wrote it down to try
[16:08] to understand what that logo is might be
[16:11] a book
[16:13] you know I fill up a computer a huge
[16:15] computer
[16:16] but if you see that logo you immediately
[16:19] know
[16:20] that what's behind it that's right is
[16:23] that that's right the hamburger the
[16:25] great Croc and the employees in the
[16:28] building and the parking lots see you
[16:30] see all the little intricate things that
[16:32] could be written down but we look at
[16:34] that logo same thing with the logos
[16:36] now to understand God like I said before
[16:40] if we within the ocean field and where
[16:43] the sky Apartments made we couldn't
[16:45] write the love of God we couldn't write
[16:47] what all this logos was in a volume of a
[16:49] book that's right amen amen but he
[16:53] condensed it into 66 chapters
[16:57] so that we can actually carry it with us
[16:59] now you know we can take Don this is the
[17:03] mind of God right all right and in here
[17:06] though remember in here though are some
[17:09] things that God thought of
[17:11] not what God is because Judas is in here
[17:15] Judas was never in the mind of God
[17:17] eternally as a thought he was thought of
[17:19] yeah
[17:20] so you got to separate those two
[17:24] Sinners are thought of
[17:26] that's why everybody can be saved
[17:29] because the sinner is thought of of God
[17:31] but the only reason I don't like going
[17:33] to do is just melt yesterday last night
[17:34] you go back and
[17:37] and you see where some people have that
[17:40] Seed doctrine and you can understand
[17:41] that but what you got to do is you gotta
[17:44] I've tried to explain it a couple of
[17:46] times and
[17:48] some preachers just look at you
[17:50] but remember brother Brown was picking
[17:52] up the mind of God and he was telling
[17:54] you in the mind of God you always was
[17:56] eternal you never sinned a day in your
[17:57] life in the mind of God he's come up to
[17:59] the mind of God he's working in that
[18:02] realm and God is telling you and where
[18:05] you come from
[18:06] where you are where you're going right
[18:09] but now as a preacher he's got to say
[18:13] now your eternal life begins at the
[18:14] altar or or I saw one the other day
[18:17] where you know one preacher he said I
[18:19] always was an eagle brother Brown said
[18:21] you always was an eagle but
[18:23] I also got two quotes from Brother
[18:25] Branham told that story and in the when
[18:28] he come up to the end of the sermon he
[18:31] was calling an altar call he said do
[18:34] some of you chickens want to become
[18:36] Eagles
[18:37] when I thought you always wasn't ill
[18:41] that's where you you get confused if you
[18:44] don't understand in the mind of God sure
[18:46] you always wasn't evil amen you always
[18:49] was a Son of God Amen and the only way
[18:51] you can be born again is because God
[18:53] knew you wanted it and he put it already
[18:55] up there it's already there
[18:57] it's like being like the brother said
[18:59] about Jesus he was crucified in the mind
[19:01] of God that covers everything
[19:04] but he had to come down through that
[19:05] though and do it down here because
[19:07] here's where the the sin happened to
[19:10] cause that remember sin started in
[19:12] heaven with with the devil but they came
[19:14] down to the Earth in this
[19:17] and then they committed the act so Jesus
[19:19] had to come down to the Earth in this to
[19:21] take away that but in the mind of God it
[19:23] was already done but remember
[19:27] you gotta think of this if God thought
[19:29] of it it had to happen that's right
[19:31] that's right
[19:32] so he didn't just think of of of the
[19:35] crucifixion in his mind if he thought of
[19:37] it it had to come to pass right
[19:40] when Isaiah said he was wounded for our
[19:42] transgression bruised for our iniquity
[19:44] see that was in the beginning was the
[19:46] word so the word come from the mind
[19:50] thought the speech and when Isaiah said
[19:53] that that meant that a literal man named
[19:55] Jesus had to be put on the cross and
[19:57] crucified
[19:59] you see what the word does the word
[20:00] brings a filter yeah
[20:02] brother Brown said what filter
[20:04] everything through the word through the
[20:06] filter of the word Isaiah said a virgin
[20:08] shall conceive well God don't you think
[20:10] I knew that before the foundation of the
[20:12] world that's the way you set it up
[20:14] and let me tell you something else to be
[20:16] and and brother Branham really did a
[20:19] good job of of trying to settle the fear
[20:21] from the people that's why he would say
[20:22] if you're born again you always worry
[20:24] Eternal or if you were in the mind of
[20:25] God you're going to come somewhere
[20:28] but remember
[20:29] if you and I believe that who we are
[20:31] that where the children have died
[20:34] then we have to go back and believe what
[20:36] God said about it amen no what man said
[20:39] what word says there's therefore now no
[20:43] condemnation
[20:44] where is our condemnation usually it's
[20:46] from one person to the next
[20:50] hello usually yes when you get that it's
[20:54] usually one person to the next
[20:56] what's this from thinking about me or
[20:57] this one said something about me or what
[21:00] you're doing you're condemning yourself
[21:03] I like that old analogy that that you
[21:05] you know you you think people talk about
[21:07] you and you spend 80 percent of your
[21:09] life worrying about what other people
[21:11] said and other people spend 80 percent
[21:13] of their time not even worrying about
[21:14] who you are and what you're doing right
[21:16] right
[21:19] you know you got your own stuff to work
[21:21] I don't want to worry about my 20
[21:23] percent I ain't gonna worry that's why I
[21:25] don't I used to I used to I used to
[21:28] bother me a certain things did but don't
[21:29] bother me anymore
[21:31] because remember it must not bother God
[21:34] he don't get nervous you don't have a
[21:36] nervous breaking down at all you know
[21:37] Monica has already seen it happen
[21:39] so remember this logos whatever he
[21:41] speaks it's already been a thought and
[21:43] that thought's Eternal and it's getting
[21:45] ready to be expressed so God has to come
[21:48] step over into that form called below
[21:50] God
[21:51] to be for us to be able to understand
[21:54] like the McDonald's to come into that
[21:57] one logo now all the marketing that
[21:59] McDonald's has done as soon as we see
[22:01] the golden arches boom we we in our mind
[22:04] we go back to all these different things
[22:06] that we know about McDonald's right how
[22:08] many different stores they got you know
[22:10] you all that
[22:11] same way we got
[22:13] when we see the when I see now where
[22:16] it's talked about even when it talks
[22:17] about the word
[22:19] and the Word was made flesh that Love
[22:21] Gospel has made what a human Fletch and
[22:24] dwelt Among Us right it was made flesh
[22:27] anytime I see the word the word the word
[22:30] the word Heaven Erica pass away but the
[22:32] logos or the word will never pass away
[22:34] all right what happens is that logos
[22:37] what it does is it brings it right back
[22:39] because it's the Creator
[22:41] right it says right here all things were
[22:43] made by him who logo the logos is the
[22:47] creator amen amen excuse me
[22:51] and the life comes through the father
[22:53] and the father and the logos is the same
[22:55] person right but we can't understand
[22:57] father we can't understand that volume
[22:59] of the book
[23:00] of McDonald's that started 75 years ago
[23:03] in all the days of her life and and how
[23:05] that you know God could take a peanut
[23:08] that goes to California and trace it all
[23:11] the way back to Georgia and what planet
[23:13] came out of and what part of the soil
[23:14] coming together to make it you
[23:17] understand what I mean yes see to me we
[23:19] don't have to worry about that that's
[23:21] right God's already worried about it not
[23:22] me in other words what to say worry
[23:24] God's already he already took care of
[23:26] that
[23:27] now of course he knows what choice we
[23:29] make we can't ever take Choice out of
[23:31] this right right it's all our choice
[23:33] from the day we were born to the day we
[23:36] die Adam and Eve had choice and made
[23:38] choices before and after but in other
[23:41] words before the fall and after the fall
[23:43] they still brother Brown said God never
[23:45] took away free moral agency all right so
[23:48] we're still afraid but remember he knows
[23:50] what you choose that's why I said many
[23:53] times
[23:54] if he knows that I'm not going to ever
[23:56] love people like I should he's not going
[23:59] to give me brotherly kindness
[24:01] and he saw that for one of the
[24:02] nomination of the world
[24:04] because of me not because of him because
[24:06] of me he made the provision for us to
[24:09] get this right the provision is there
[24:12] actually the one that's inside of you is
[24:13] that
[24:14] really kindness but you as a human
[24:19] with a free moral agency your gods
[24:22] God knew that you'd never loved somebody
[24:25] like you really should so he's not going
[24:26] to give you brother counters and he
[24:27] definitely is not going to jump my
[24:29] brother around him had to preach this
[24:30] there's no way that you can jump around
[24:32] any of these you got to do it just like
[24:36] it says building goes all the way up and
[24:39] and remember all this comes out of the
[24:42] Soul into the spirit this is the spirit
[24:45] realm remember Faith or doubts the only
[24:48] two things in your soul Faith or doubt
[24:50] right yes baby that's right so what does
[24:53] this do this comes into the spirit Realm
[24:57] there's nothing to do with this with the
[24:59] body right nothing this has nothing to
[25:02] do with your physical human flesh body
[25:04] right
[25:06] it's just there
[25:07] it does what's inside right
[25:11] but
[25:12] these
[25:14] come from the new birth
[25:16] my brother being born again
[25:19] these have to be birthed into your
[25:21] spirit realm because your your spirit's
[25:25] not born again
[25:27] we wish
[25:28] if not
[25:30] your spirit's not born again so in your
[25:32] spirit around memory reason conscious
[25:34] affection I'm going to preach a sermon
[25:36] on that one day because all these come
[25:38] out of
[25:40] memory reason
[25:43] why are you have a temper
[25:47] it comes from your memory reason
[25:50] conscious affection affection and
[25:53] Imagination that old thing imagination
[25:56] there's that thing we talk about
[25:57] imagination
[25:58] but all this comes out of there because
[26:01] what does your imagination do you can't
[26:03] love bro a brother because you think he
[26:06] talked about you or you think something
[26:08] that's your imagination are your memory
[26:12] reminds you that he did something two
[26:14] years ago to you that you can't get on
[26:17] and you reason in your human brain that
[26:20] he's a dog
[26:25] so it all works when memories and
[26:27] conscious affection affection affection
[26:31] because remember this is divine love
[26:34] that has nothing to do with video love
[26:35] this is agape love
[26:37] okay we still have feel your love here
[26:40] that's right
[26:42] everybody shake their head right we
[26:44] still have feelings even when this comes
[26:46] I believe brother Brown has this Divine
[26:48] love because he was adopted he still had
[26:51] feel your love he didn't stop loving his
[26:53] wife he just stop loving the people he
[26:54] didn't stop loving his kids
[26:56] right right
[26:59] so you see where we're going with this
[27:00] the logos to me
[27:03] when you say now that word logos we
[27:05] ought to be able to understand at least
[27:07] what it is at least we ought to
[27:10] understand that it's everything that you
[27:13] and I need to know down here
[27:15] to get us over I don't want to say up
[27:18] there over into another dimension
[27:20] okay because remember everybody's all
[27:24] this Doctrine about perfect love and
[27:26] what is perfect love
[27:28] perfect love brother Brown says
[27:30] everybody in that sixth Dimension had
[27:31] one thing in common
[27:33] they were black-headed redheaded Chinese
[27:36] black whatever
[27:37] he said they had one thing in common
[27:39] they all had perfect love one is perfect
[27:41] love the new birth that's right the new
[27:43] birth is perfect love then you grow into
[27:46] the perfect part but the new birth so
[27:49] the only thing those people had in
[27:50] common in the sixth Dimension was they
[27:51] all were born again
[27:53] they were all born again on this Earth
[27:56] they come from all different walks of
[27:57] life that one lady was 90 years old
[27:59] now she's a young lady she was in that
[28:02] perfect love so that sixth Dimension is
[28:06] all just for the people this morning in
[28:08] so to me simply the perfect love is the
[28:10] born against Mary yeah
[28:13] even in this baby form you get born
[28:15] again today and die tomorrow you go in
[28:17] the sixth Dimension just like brother
[28:18] Brown's in the sixth Dimension right
[28:19] amen right Paul Irene is awesome even
[28:23] even Luther right but Luther didn't take
[28:26] his Pub drinking and smoking into that
[28:30] Dimension right because that little guy
[28:32] said was inside it never did that what
[28:34] happened was his human filter couldn't
[28:36] filter that out
[28:39] see God was trying to work back up
[28:41] through here brother Brown said what he
[28:42] didn't have enough word
[28:44] quickened to him the word was that he
[28:47] just didn't have enough in other words
[28:49] he couldn't stand and talk about the
[28:51] logos like me and you talked about the
[28:52] logos now because there's no he was
[28:55] under the what the man anointing which
[28:57] was a little bit higher but the man
[28:59] can't see there's a wall there man can't
[29:01] see over it but man an eagle can go way
[29:03] up and see all the way around so that's
[29:04] what you and I under the eagle anointing
[29:06] we can see things that even that even
[29:09] Paul couldn't see
[29:12] that even Paul couldn't see that's right
[29:14] Paul said I'll look through a glass
[29:15] Darkly listen we're not supposed to lift
[29:17] the glass Darkly in this age that's
[29:18] right right
[29:20] this is the open book The Clarity of the
[29:22] word Paul was looking at a closed book
[29:26] too many people and to his self because
[29:29] he was prophesying but you and I when we
[29:31] come up to the open book when the book's
[29:33] open when John eats the book he eats a
[29:35] whole book amen any pages and leaves up
[29:38] went on the floor he'll leave me a
[29:40] leftovers he didn't leave it he didn't
[29:42] get hungry and full and at least I'm on
[29:44] the table not eat the whole book so that
[29:47] but what it was was what it was was is
[29:49] that logos came down
[29:51] was was the logos came down God himself
[29:56] Christ had to be here when that angel
[29:58] was on Earth so they could connect and
[30:00] what
[30:01] crash can't be hearing human flesh so he
[30:05] used a human flesh called William
[30:06] Branham hey son of man I'll be son of
[30:09] man to deliver the message so that you
[30:12] and I can see what we're seeing now
[30:13] that's right and to me that's just as
[30:15] simple as the whole message is
[30:18] a man told me one time and it really I
[30:20] think both T3
[30:22] he said this message
[30:24] this message now remember
[30:27] this message is not getting born again
[30:29] and even living to hear it
[30:32] it's the Son of God Revelation we're
[30:35] going to talk about that maybe next
[30:36] Sunday right
[30:38] everybody I said everybody
[30:41] Paul called this back to First Churchill
[30:43] way back right down here
[30:45] come all the way through here
[30:47] but we are up into a like I said in the
[30:50] eagle anointing that's true but bro T3
[30:53] made it real simple he said this message
[30:54] was sent for preparation
[30:58] and that's it
[31:00] to prepare a people to take a body chain
[31:02] right because everybody every everybody
[31:06] that has a new birth down through here
[31:07] had a part of these and couldn't
[31:10] understand the word of God for their day
[31:12] the word was quickened you can't get
[31:14] born again without the word being
[31:15] quicker so they had the word quickened
[31:17] in their heart for their time
[31:20] right right so what makes this different
[31:22] brother Brown's message was for
[31:24] Preparation it was to prepare us for a
[31:27] body change because nobody else needs to
[31:29] be prepared during that ages this was
[31:31] the last stage this is the part of the
[31:32] body chain so that's what this message
[31:34] the message in the hour was brought for
[31:37] Preparation to get us ready see all
[31:41] these other messages got the people what
[31:43] brother Brown said got them born again
[31:45] they live a good Christian life and they
[31:47] die
[31:49] right right even brother Brown said go
[31:52] on with the same simple message live a
[31:54] good Christian Life what's he telling
[31:57] them live a good Christian life because
[31:58] that message in 1963 of the seals wasn't
[32:02] even for that group of people that's
[32:04] great
[32:06] do you think they understood it no no
[32:09] they didn't understand it
[32:11] he was actually giving it for me and you
[32:13] that's right because in the days of the
[32:16] boys he had to go off the scene so the
[32:17] voice could come who was the voice same
[32:20] logos that said let there be it's the
[32:22] same person that now speaking in the
[32:24] days of the voice when I hear in the
[32:26] days when I see that in the days of the
[32:27] boys
[32:28] I really don't think of brother round
[32:32] sure he's the sure he's worth but
[32:35] remember his one voice is 1100 sermons
[32:38] and they've got all kinds of doctrines
[32:39] of that right so it's not the literal
[32:42] voice
[32:44] of that seventh angel everything he
[32:46] wrote we understand no wrong answer
[32:48] everything he wrote we all have the same
[32:51] Doctrine right no
[32:54] but in Revelations 10 John took the book
[32:58] from what the angel
[33:00] Christ you didn't take it from the
[33:02] seventh angel messenger he took it from
[33:05] the angel Christ Christ is the only
[33:07] right one he's the only he's the only
[33:09] one that's got the full anointing of the
[33:11] message right it's not saying brother
[33:13] Brown Don't the Phil he came through I
[33:15] was thinking about last night I thought
[33:16] brother round if you'd have just said a
[33:17] few more words it would have done away
[33:19] with this doctor and if you'd have said
[33:21] a few more words but you know what
[33:23] Jesus said eat my flesh and drink my
[33:25] blood yep
[33:26] walked off the stage right he said
[33:29] unless you believe I am he you'll die in
[33:31] your sins and he walked off the stage
[33:35] he didn't go back and explain it why
[33:37] because the voice
[33:39] The Voice had to come back and explain
[33:41] it to me the logos is the voice because
[33:44] that's the true voice that's the one
[33:46] that is true when you hear Brother
[33:49] Branham you need to hear that logos
[33:51] that's behind that yeah right and he
[33:54] said it the way he was going to say it
[33:56] to confuse people he said it the way he
[33:59] was going to say it because if you
[34:01] you're looking at who's this melchized
[34:02] that you think man brother Brown Peter
[34:04] said about two more sentences
[34:06] you had to cleared up all this two Soul
[34:09] Doctrine or or I always was eternal
[34:12] Doctrine and not but see you got to
[34:14] remember it's all in the message
[34:17] it's all inside what he said it's all in
[34:20] there we just got to put it together
[34:21] yeah right but how do you put it
[34:22] together by the one that wrote it the
[34:25] one that wrote the Bible if he's in your
[34:26] brain
[34:29] and your soul and you let him get in
[34:31] your brain by the new birth then what
[34:33] will happen he'll speak to you he'll
[34:34] speak to you today he'll speak to you in
[34:36] the quietness of your room he'll speak
[34:38] to you even through the prophet when
[34:40] brother Brown says when I read it the
[34:41] other day the third person of the
[34:43] Trinity was the Holy Ghost
[34:45] now
[34:46] did that I mean did that just really
[34:48] make you nervous say oh brother no you
[34:51] run it through the filter
[34:53] and the filter says I know what he was
[34:55] talking about he said that for that
[34:58] that's what I'm saying he spoke the mind
[35:00] of God yet he spoke to humans
[35:02] you got to come to the Altar and be
[35:04] saved but you always was eternal that's
[35:06] just really confusing if you don't
[35:08] understand that God's telling us if
[35:09] we're born again that's where we came
[35:11] from but as human beings in the fall we
[35:15] got to come somewhere don't have to come
[35:16] to alter but we gotta come somewhere and
[35:18] accept what he's already done all right
[35:20] okay so let's go
[35:22] everything
