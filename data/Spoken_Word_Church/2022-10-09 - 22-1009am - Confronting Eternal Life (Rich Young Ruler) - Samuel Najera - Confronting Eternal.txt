God we believe that he's the only one that can help us foreign I want to express this morning what God has given us this morning and so those who have who take notes this morning we want to talk about confrontando La Vida Eterna confronting eternal life and I believe that each and every one of us were confronting a day or facing a day because we don't know what's going to happen tomorrow but this morning we are face to face with eternal life foreign loving Heavenly Father we thank you this morning We Believe Lord that you're the only one that can help us or I have nothing Within Myself to give to my brethren but you do Lord and this morning we believe that you're here because you were the first one invited the first honored guest Lord help us this morning we commit ourselves into your holy hands they ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen escritura we're gonna take this scripture Marcos capitulo dies Mark chapter 10 verse 17. read in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and when he was gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeled to him and asked him good Master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life Jesus and Jesus said unto him why call us thou me good there is none good but one that is God Terrace the con the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness the frod not honor thy father and mother maestro is and he answered and said unto him master all these have I observed from my youth and ton says Jesus then Jesus beholden him loved him and said unto him one thing thou lack us go that way so whatsoever thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me palabra mucho muchas posaciones and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions and Jesus looked around about and says unto his disciples how hardly shall they have riches enter into the kingdom of God Lord Jesus Christ bless his word it's good to listen to this scripture and read the scripture but believe in that each day that goes by we're hopefully we're scaling up that we're growing in our walk with God and that's the reason why we come to church because we believe because we want to walk with God Amen and so this morning we're facing eternal life now when we're here at church we should lay us out all the problems all the weights and the sins that easily be said because we can be here seated at church let our mind be somewhere else thoughts could be somewhere else now you see the scripture that we were reading this young man how many of us know if we have eternal life have we really met the Lord face to face that's a good question because this the question that this young man has what can I do to inherit eternal life and so Jesus told him do you know the Commandments see yes so it's given to us there's been a homework that has been do the things that we need to do as a Christian fulfill the Commandments maybe we could say yes and so are we following the Lord the life that we live is what shows that we are following the Lord or trying to say now the Lord knows our hearts and there's there is something that I really like of an older person he asked he has the young man he said grandfather Iglesia he said why do why do you go to church was because I like it it's my duty to go to church what did you learn today well I don't know but maybe I didn't learn anything that's how we are sometimes why did we not learn something like because really we weren't in that church elsewhere maybe the the the ranchers the people out in the country maybe they were thinking there was a tree that was going to fall on their little house or that their cows were gonna go away and that's why they couldn't learn something at church that day now he's going to church every single time and what did you learn I don't know if I did learn something so why do you go to church we we call old we call them older because the older ones know because the life that they have lived the experience that they have had that's what made them to know what they know now watch this El Senor the Lord oh the the the the the the the man in this illustration the the older man cuatro canastas he had he had four baskets and in those four baskets there was carbon in those in those baskets do you know how carbon looks like how does carbon look like it has little little bitty pieces in it within it I guess and that place where you put those things in negro it looks dark it looks like so now notice the older man he told the young man go bring me water AWA go bring water okay okay but how am I gonna bring water in that basket go away go okay all right takes the basket and he fills it with water and he pulls it out and he takes it and he asks him where is the water the water fell out okay all right go get more water but the water keeps falling out of the basket no go go get more water okay all right he takes the basket he fills it with water and he tries to bring it to him where is the water where if it all fell out now compare these baskets with the one that you use to take out the water water is what cleanses right and water is the is compared to the word [Music] and so he told them he said look I go to church because I want to be clean I want to be washed [Applause] he said maybe yesterday I didn't learn but I went to church what keeps us clean brothers and sisters and if you reject the Lord Jesus Christ today you are facing eternal life and if you reject you have denied the Lord Jesus because as you reject is denying amen amen and so believing that what God has given us so that we can take it in our hearts what should I do [Music] this message s and this morning aren't you happy for that before that get to me you don't know if we are here I didn't come to him the prophet said no one seeks God is seeking bro he planted in the before the foundation of the world blessed be the name of the Lord because you weren't interested in God he was the one that was interested in you because a seed as it grows that eventually will give forth fruit amen amen as you start getting into the things of God and as you start living a different life your fruits are going to be different you're not gonna act like the way you used to act you're gonna act as a son and daughter of God that's the reason amen he chose you but uh to be a son and daughter of God amen blessed be the name of the Lord I mean you're happy this morning [Applause] you forgive me that I speak Spanish but thank the Lord I mean this brother speaks Spanish very well as well brother praise the Lord and Tom says so as I said infinito plan God In His Infinite plan he thought of you and me he thought of me because even while we were in in sins and and uh in our downfalls he chose us he chose us for what to be for eternal life for eternal life have you ever asked yourself Senor Lord I want to have eternal life have you ever asked that now why does the question come on why does that question come to you you've paid your tithesis you've obeyed the Lord but why does that question come to you something to think about why do I ask myself do I have eternal life amen now when that question comes to you we should have we should be very careful very careful Judas had the the greatest Master around him Pedro Peter Los Apostles all the apostles he used to be they had the master with them they faced eternal life uh personally mentiros Peter well maybe was a liar you know and what about us what are we have we denied the Lord yes see yeah the Lord Jesus Christ knows when Peter was very excited and he told Jesus he said I'll go with you until death I'm gonna defend you Lord in in his own desires he tried he wanted to defend the Lord but all um May the Lord Jesus told him he said look Peter you're going to deny me and so the question is that that's the that's where the question comes how many times have we in our life to denied the Lord and your own Natural Life I see older people here I see young people here maybe you ask yourselves the question do I have eternal life all right now look when Peter was with God I mean when Peter was with the Lord he didn't know Pedro no Sabia he didn't know you know why because he didn't have the Holy Spirit he didn't have the Holy Spirit but in his own desires in his own impulses he said I'm gonna fight for you Lord Jesus but when the Lord Jesus told him Peter you're going to deny him oh Lord I will never do that no so the doubt comes in his mind what is it that you fight with you fight demons day by day by the grace of God we're here this morning by the grace of God it is by nothing else but by the grace of God and so when you overcame this morning all kinds of different things this morning you're facing eternal life you have it before you in French and you say Lord I'm going I'm serving you today with all of my heart I'm going to serve you with all of my heart but maybe tomorrow we forget of our promise that we made the Lord you remember that when Peter was there he was hiring himself aren't you one of the ones that are following Jesus no no no and do you know why they recognize him because of the way he dressed see yeah and so you and I Patron we have we have a pattern because that's going to help you that's going to help you so but it's a it's a choice you can do it you can do it any man as the prophet teaches us maybe he left school University his parents taught him good things and when he finished what he was trying to finish he ended up with a lot of money so the Bible that's why the Bible calls in the Rich Young Ruler now when he came to face to face with eternal life because Jesus is eternal life amen amen Jesus is eternal life because he said I am the way the truth in the life and death can't dwell with eternal life so us a we have come face to face with eternal life in our in our walk in our daily life even if you're young or if you're older the devil doesn't care about ages the devil doesn't care about that what he cares about is to be able to derail you derail your mind first because Paul said every day we have to renew hey the name of the Lord move in amen [Music] maybe I went ahead a little bit but I want you to see this the the word confront they say is facing someone or something expensive especially in a challenge in La Vida is in life it's inevitable for you to have to face uh to come face to face with some things in life dominance we confront our fears so that we don't allow them to dominate us we confront error because ignoring it might do us wrong might do us bad Jesus confrontations Jesus had several confrontations with those who were coming against him the apostles and the prophets in the bible they felt that they uh forced to confront themselves being that their message would bother the people is that correct util confrontation can be good or could also be bad depending the situation respect and the Bible gives examples of this [Music] confrontation is motivated by pride and and wrong desire or other carnal desires okay those that confront others were in order to to be able to to win some favor for themselves or to seem like they're better than someone else they're abusing that art of Confrontation Las Vegas Street Wars start when a leader of a of a gang leader starts promise with another one teclado social media Wars start when one starts with another one and on that on those platforms you know what I'm talking about you're not yeah you're not gaining anything with these confrontations because your motives are are are are are are are just dealing just with you Jesus many times was an object of a confrontation confrontations while he was preaching and teaching in Judea Los principales the main the the priests and the Pharisees we're motivated by pride and fear and the fact that they didn't know what was going on and the desire to be able to say and that's why they felt offended what Jesus would say and do yeah and they will take advantage of any opportunity to confront him so confrontation and his last confrontation finished was on his crucifixion in history and human history the greatest crime of human history now watch the prophet teaches us he tells us everything that we do that we do wrong when we know better we have to be very careful because this is like this is like a thread El Diablos Devo wants to cut it and he wants to disconnect us amen amen and once you're disconnected you're running desperately but your threat has been cut and so when you come to desperation right I'm going to say it this way many people lose children what can you do you can get desperate you can cry you can you can do whatever you will never begin to get him back he will never come back aura now to cut the communication con dios with God yes Amor that who is love who cuts that communication El Diablo the devil our enemy and so how are we are going to confront eternal life because all the things of this life is they're wanting to trap us especially social media social media is one of the most dangerous things is allowing spiritual death in people so we want to confront or come face to face with eternal life when we can't it is sometimes there's no remedy for it anymore there's no remedies because you are cut yeah you have no connection so that's why the devil wants Brothers to just fight with them once it's separated from fellowshipping but that's why we're here this morning we're Servants of the Lord Jesus Christ to come together eternal life or face to face eternal life because the majority is the greater power La Union the union it's great it's a greater power amen amen foreign let's read the uh what brother Brown says the message that God gave us is are you happy this morning blessed me in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Benson and the message come follow me paragraph 39. they said the Holy Spirit through brother Brown he says here let's look at this fellow for a few minutes that we read about no no I do that no doubt that this kid was born in a good home why is there no doubt about that because he was young he knew the Commandments he was rich and there was there was no doubt about that Nosotros cuantos enrichos how many are rich here how many are millionaires I'm a millionaire yeah Paul said that we're we're expensive in the eyes of God Amen we're expensive just one one soul that has repentance and saved how much is it worth Mazda yes more than ten thousand worlds you don't even that doesn't even cover half of the United States do you know more than ten thousand words that's that's your worth [Laughter] for gas a young man in our age but this young man he was rich he was he was wealthy but what he didn't have what he didn't know if he had or not if he had an eternal life or not and when you know that you have eternal life you're the most happiest person ever you're the most thankful person brother Branham says that you're waiting for the doors so that you can come worship the good worshiper is the one that worships in every moment and in every place amen are you with me okay all right let's continue I don't know how much time I have I'm just I'm just starting [Laughter] I normally reach back home about 35 minutes so you don't worry so this is what we see when Jesus uh okay so no doubt that this kid was born in a good home like you kids are he was brought up with good parents because it proved that when Jesus presented to him the Commandments of God Esso is he he said I've kept these since youth it showed that he had been he had been brought up right this is the prophet uses this word he wasn't just a snatch out you know he had been brought up to know what's right kids like you all are problems probably come up under a God-fearing Mother and Daddy okay to teach him right when he was a kid that's what I like is you instruct a child in the way now when we're talking about a child I believe it's not just a a little newborn and you come to the knowledge of the world come to this glorious message you are a child you're a child this is an instructor is a child in the way that is in the natural you could you can do it is to go that when he gets older he shall not depart in our life there's not one but the life that has been given us that that teaching that has been taught us that won't go away from us and each one of us that have backslips we have to return we have to return favorite man amen why do we have to return because it's part of the plan of God it's part of God's perfect plan in this day we were predestinated in this in this age for what to manifest and to be manifested as Sons and Daughters he said we are waiting amen blessed be the name of the Lord now this young man because of his riches he didn't want to accept eternal life he was before eternal life and he rejected it he had three more agents acceptor he he was gonna accept and as he accepted he had to obey what the eternal life was telling him what was the eternal life telling him go sell everything that you have now what do you have what do you have to sell lucky let me tell you that each and every one of you nothing is free but the Lord Jesus said come and buy Cindy without money and without price brother and sister the devil has not given us anything free the devil never tells you anything for free or gives you anything for free now you have to just go ahead and just give it back to him and this is not mine all these wrong desires all these bad actions so I just give them back to you Satan [Music] blessed be the name of the Lord amen in paragraph 40 is um in the same in the same uh quote maybe his mom had great Ambitions Ambitions for him how many mothers here how many are mothers who have children you as mothers you want the best for your children right you want your children to be the best especially since we recognize this message he's come to try to steal that away from us mentally yeah spiritually does your son want to come to church does your son really want to come to church have you sat down with him or asked your daughter and master daughter do you really want to come to church it's a good question I tell you that by experience and it broke my heart so much my oldest son is an obedient boy pero but he's not going to church he told me he said Dad you killed the name he broke your experience I want to have my own experience I want to feel it for myself this is that broke my heart so much this is he said I don't want you to come knock the door and tell me let's go to church don't come knocking my door like that anymore how do you think I felt when he told me that now us being parents that the lord lord Jesus said you're good parents you've given everything to your children we're not going to give them a stone instead of bread you're not going to give them a snake instead of a fish that's right you're going to give them the best and how much our heavenly father that he loves us and so what you love and when you tell say those things how do you think you feel so our heavenly father how do you think he feels when you tell him when one of his children when one of his children has rejected his word how do you think he feels now do we really need an experience see yeah we need it either whether you're young and your experience the new birth and so when you know have the new birth your nature changes he's the one that teaches us of what we need to do and during Como Padre as a father you bring your child to church at 10 years old eight years old come on let's go to church and because they want to obey let's go but really do they really want to come yeah foreign let's ask ourselves as parents do our children really if they haven't really had that experience in their life and if you haven't experienced that in your life ask them that before the devil takes them it's hard you know you just look at the prophet's life how he felt how did Brother Branham feel him being the servant of God can you imagine that all eyes were on him we're on the servant of the Lord yes yes a leader at church and what can you do you know [Music] what you say is what your children are going to do when the Lord deals with your heart or whatever because the the steps of a good song are ordered by who are ordered by God blessed be the name of the Lord I don't think I'm gonna finish but I think we have two Services right right okay all right Lord Jesus allows we might continue this afternoon in in paragraph 41 continuing to read here in the same message with him praying constant the men constantly so that your so that their son would not be just a common boy see see but an extraordinary young man that is what every parent would want is did you hear Jesus as he referred to that commandment honor your father and mother and so he's he stood there yes and that is the ambition of any father do the best he can for his children to educate them [Music] to maybe even give them the things that they themself have themselves had and that's how I feel with my children sometimes I think about going to school and I sent Becky and I sent Sarah Jose and Joseph is to these to these schools and all these places where all these bad behaviors I would rather just take them up in a mountain somewhere and raise them up there with the Indians but this is the thing this is the thing watch what the prophet says here what is in this in the in the child is going to come out no important doesn't matter where he is that is going to come out if there's wickedness there that's what's going to come out and even in the Indian Camp if I suggested if he's going to be so you see Aura now watch social media I have heard Hombres older man I have rejected this message why 40 years how many years did Moses walk in the desert how many cuantos cuantos Dias and the prophet says how much time do they have to get to the promised land in reality just a short time that's how we are now we think we're 40 years into this and we're just the best of the best when you start thinking like that you're the most miserable one [Music] when we see that it's old when we see that maybe it's not running anymore likes to make you look like junk in your mind our mind our spirit is when you have those tools available you're good to go you're good to go but you need this message is to what to restore is that's why God sent this message and what was he going to restore this restaurant it was going to restore something that was already kind of a junkie Hermanos amen you're a child of God you're his daughter of God while you're facing eternal life face to face on a daily basis Jesus told this young man go sell everything that you have give it to the poor Ben and then come is follow me every week yeah no no Diario he said daily come follow me and to serve God daily is to live a life that is worth where there's worth more than yes the ten thousand worlds and when the people say you look good look at that nice hair you have estas are you walking are you preaching sir man [Applause] okay Bueno solo give me one more minute and let me just read you this last one stand to your feet have the musicians come and the prophet continues here asking this question do you know something 86 of conversions to Jesus Christ who said happened before the 21 years old that's what it shows statistics that's what statistics show that's what the the statistics shows 86 of those that come to Christ come before they're 21. once you're out you're past that age you're more molded or hardened in your ways possible but it's possible sure whether it's 70 or or when they come to 70 or 80 years old they come in but sometimes it's it's it's not it's strange for that to happen now if the Lord has called us what has he called us to are you in German there is a calling me come unto me either way tired of what of life the life that
