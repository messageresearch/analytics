[16:38] will be the ministers meeting here for
[16:41] the ministers only and I'm sure that if
[16:45] some of you would like to help June uh
[16:48] on that Saturday she will be fixing it
[16:51] don't know how much my wife can do
[16:53] because she got where she got can't do a
[16:55] lot but she'll be trying to help us she
[16:57] can but and the the uh uh two olive
[17:03] trees and and the things we will cover
[17:05] that maybe later but being the two olive
[17:08] trees being the old and the New
[17:09] Testament
[17:12] right and see
[17:14] then but the point of it is it's our
[17:17] journey that I'm want us to see
[17:21] amen now what if you was an
[17:25] Israelite and you could really get over
[17:27] there now and take one of those
[17:29] Jews Israelites you know
[17:32] whatever and you could say do you know
[17:34] that
[17:36] Ezekiel was covering your
[17:39] journey through
[17:42] life all you need is somebody to break
[17:46] these symbols
[17:48] y you see well would be so dangerous for
[17:51] brother brandom to have went to Israel
[17:53] oh yeah let alone the Messiah sign
[17:57] yeah you remember how talked to that man
[17:59] about was the healing of John Ryan and
[18:01] the old man said you can't cut God into
[18:03] three pieces it to Jew he said sir we
[18:06] don't do it
[18:08] amen he turned right around and took the
[18:11] scriptures and laid it back and the man
[18:13] started quoting the scriptures of the
[18:14] New Testament he said he'd been in the
[18:16] book yeah and he said he believed
[18:20] it but see he couldn't accept it right
[18:23] why because it wasn't the hour
[18:26] no but one day all of that will unfold
[18:29] yeah what about when they were going
[18:31] down there you know to come back to
[18:34] Israel they wouldn't get on them
[18:36] airplanes to fly home right they was out
[18:39] there digging they didn't know what an
[18:40] airplane was probably never seen one
[18:44] they were out there digging for a
[18:46] living they CT him down tried to get him
[18:48] on the plane you remember they wouldn't
[18:51] get on they Rabbi got up and he said God
[18:55] said we'd fly home on the wings of an
[18:57] eagle there it sits they crawled on y
[19:00] they ready to go home y see it become a
[19:04] reality to them
[19:07] right what do you think about when you
[19:09] would get to the Homeland
[19:11] and and there you would they asked them
[19:14] said you coming home to die no we're
[19:16] coming home to see the Messiah amen
[19:19] that's been 40 something years ago
[19:22] yep but you know it was real to them
[19:27] right yeah they cherish that citizenship
[19:30] so
[19:31] much until if your mother or daddy
[19:34] either one was a Jew you can go right
[19:36] over now and get an Israeli citizenship
[19:38] that's
[19:40] y they don't question you all you got to
[19:44] show that you you got to St come from a
[19:48] Jewish
[19:51] y if that could be that much about a
[19:54] natural Nation what can you and I be
[19:55] about the word of God
[19:57] right we've had 40 something years to
[20:00] argue around
[20:03] orb fuss about the seals the Thunders
[20:05] the plagues the the two Souls is all
[20:09] kind of doctrines I think it's about
[20:12] time to head to the promised land amen
[20:13] that's right that's right you know I
[20:17] think it's about time to realize we're
[20:18] in the promised land
[20:25] amen remember now this is not just a
[20:28] type of the
[20:31] in glory you know to Glory but it is a
[20:34] scene of when we will actually get there
[20:37] right yep that's what I'm trying to get
[20:40] you to see y we're not there right
[20:45] now now come on John goes up in a
[20:48] top you know what he does he has to look
[20:51] back down here and see what we're
[20:56] doing come on you say well that was that
[20:59] was God taking him into the future okay
[21:02] that's
[21:04] good but you know the future can't be
[21:06] any good unless this present
[21:08] time is
[21:13] correct right sure
[21:16] amen so now let's get down to think
[21:19] about
[21:20] it the scene in heaven that we look
[21:24] at is now being played out and has been
[21:28] 2,000 years you're on
[21:33] Earth these combat beasts the lon the
[21:35] oxim man the eagle they had their place
[21:37] here on
[21:39] Earth if I don't choose to get back to
[21:41] it I don't know how fast I'm going but
[21:44] you know brother ROM go into the message
[21:46] I'll be glad to give you the
[21:47] books he covers Matthew Mark Luke and
[21:50] John that's right as the come back this
[21:53] guarding the book of Acts right
[21:57] amen the book of of Acts is not the
[21:59] guarding
[22:01] the Matthew Mark Luke and John he was
[22:03] getting it backwards right the book of
[22:06] Acts is guarded by that's right Matthew
[22:10] Mark luk and John you remember how he
[22:12] brought
[22:13] it you read over in Acts you know repent
[22:16] everyone to be baptized in the name of
[22:17] Jesus
[22:18] Christ we can go back to the gospels and
[22:21] find out what that name is
[22:23] right did they guard it
[22:26] all see then down down Through the
[22:31] Ages just say this then we'll read most
[22:33] of it down Through the Ages you had the
[22:36] line lasted for so
[22:39] long and then you had the Dark Ages come
[22:41] along that was the ox
[22:44] right then you had the man under Luther
[22:47] Wesley Knox finny all of those smart
[22:51] screw y
[22:53] man just like Brother Richard said the
[22:55] other day on T remember each one of
[22:58] those combat Beast is Earthly y That's
[23:01] right yes
[23:03] sir L the ox man the eagle Eagle's the
[23:07] only one that's the Heavenly
[23:10] bird and we better believe as I was
[23:12] trying to express while ago if we can
[23:15] believe all of those others were the
[23:17] people were the combat Beast under their
[23:19] messenger why can't we believe we're the
[23:21] combat beast that's right under our
[23:23] messenger
[23:25] amen you know how I answer people when
[23:28] I'm talking talking
[23:30] to I'm talking to somebody there
[23:32] discussing one God Etc or
[23:36] something you know how I
[23:38] answer I don't say brother R said so and
[23:41] so right they don't know who he is and
[23:43] don't care amen but you know what I'm
[23:46] doing I'm just running through my mind
[23:49] while they
[23:51] talk and I'm remembering what brother R
[23:54] said to those people right when he
[23:56] talked to them correct
[24:01] right that's the best answer
[24:04] MH if it conquered Satan one time they
[24:06] conquer him again right well that would
[24:09] be a good way of doing it right now
[24:13] listen so the scene we're looking at in
[24:17] heaven cuz that's what brother R says
[24:19] about Revelation
[24:22] 5 I actually got to quote that in here
[24:25] where he said this is a scene this is
[24:27] not a verse but verse he's talking about
[24:30] the fifth chapter not a verse by verse
[24:32] he said he said it's a scene you know
[24:35] what a scene
[24:36] is comes across the screen it's got
[24:38] something on it's showing it to you all
[24:41] right this is the
[24:44] bride sitting in her position in glory
[24:49] all right that's fine we're looking at
[24:52] that but now let's get to our
[24:54] position
[24:57] right and don't put us there because we
[25:00] can read it there
[25:04] right people say the seals is broke to
[25:07] brother brandom they broke to me well
[25:09] tell me what they are I I they just they
[25:12] broke to brother brandom
[25:14] yeah well that's
[25:17] good but what about
[25:19] you right man what about you what what's
[25:23] broke to you what can you
[25:27] see
[25:30] well I I I I just St when a glory to God
[25:33] I try my best to stay with what brother
[25:34] rown
[25:36] said that's what I've been trying to do
[25:38] for 40 something years right that's why
[25:41] I keep preaching the same thing over and
[25:43] over just I don't worry about
[25:46] it but let's get down to it
[25:49] now the Throne of God that you look at
[25:53] in Revelations
[25:55] 4:1 and all those things
[25:59] up to the tribulation part where it's
[26:01] the Thunders and the
[26:05] Lightnings it had its beginning here
[26:10] right it actually started
[26:13] here that's why brother R when he get to
[26:16] the to the
[26:17] seals he would say this is not to the
[26:20] bride this is to Israel but we will look
[26:22] back and see where it came
[26:25] from that's what he was doing right
[26:29] so you say well the for the first seal
[26:32] Antichrist it's
[26:34] Antichrist well where did he come from
[26:37] right how' he get to be the
[26:41] Antichrist you know that that was so
[26:43] deceiving until they wouldn't but one
[26:45] man ever called him the Antichrist until
[26:48] brother random come
[26:51] along and that was John the Revelator
[26:54] that's right they come back from patas y
[26:58] he didn't say it while he was in his own
[27:00] life here in his own Ministry until he
[27:02] went to patmas but when he went to
[27:04] patmas and come back he called it the
[27:06] Antichrist the word Antichrist does not
[27:08] appear
[27:10] until over in the little
[27:12] gospels right Paul called it Grievious
[27:18] wolves he didn't call it
[27:22] Antichrist you see we didn't say first
[27:24] seal
[27:27] Antichrist
[27:28] I thought the seal the seal was the holy
[27:30] spirit amen right and the Antichrist was
[27:33] what's going away from it
[27:36] right but now think about
[27:40] it these combat beasts never started in
[27:48] heaven they started on
[27:53] Earth all
[27:56] right Ezekiel
[28:00] when he saw what he saw that combat
[28:03] Beast to Israel never started in Heaven
[28:06] Keep relating to that for this
[28:08] morning it was Israel in Journey upon
[28:13] Earth so is it now it's it's the bride
[28:16] of Christ the real true Israel in
[28:19] Journey and seeing
[28:23] ourselves seeing how God has dealt down
[28:26] through time through seven churches
[28:29] ages in these
[28:31] ways so now let's watch as the
[28:34] Beast come forth on the
[28:38] earth
[28:40] then we'll be able to see
[28:43] them in heaven after the
[28:51] Rapture but you got number
[28:56] 4,833 when you see those combat beasts
[28:59] in
[29:00] heaven be real
[29:06] careful they are angels and they are
[29:12] angels there are angels that are
[29:16] messengers there are angels that are
[29:23] angels the one scen in Revelations
[29:27] 4:1 are not just the Heavenly
[29:30] angels that are singing holy holy holy
[29:34] Lord God
[29:38] Almighty I would write that
[29:42] down those in Revelations 4:1 are saying
[29:46] holy holy Lord God Almighty
[29:50] right because that's us after the
[29:53] Rapture y worshiping
[29:57] God
[29:59] no no it's just Angel see that's where
[30:01] you tied
[30:03] up you you got your mind
[30:07] locked if these four combat beast on
[30:10] Earth was in the bride of Christ when
[30:11] they get to heaven where are they going
[30:12] to be it's not beast in the bride right
[30:17] come on now we're going to separate
[30:18] something this
[30:20] afternoon this is not just a uh an
[30:26] anointing that comes down upon
[30:29] people that's well and good that's
[30:31] anointed
[30:34] one this is actually the combat Beast
[30:37] are actually the spirit of God Amen in
[30:40] the people that's right
[30:45] amen come on the spirit of God in the
[30:49] people not the spirit of God on the
[30:55] people that's what I'm saying that you
[30:57] you get all that tied together and you
[30:59] get angels angels
[31:00] angels Revelation 4 there it says they
[31:03] worship and GL you know throw their
[31:06] crowns down so they're not
[31:10] Angel
[31:13] right Angels don't have
[31:18] crowns this group of angels are
[31:26] beings I read that to you the other day
[31:28] you listening yes brother said
[31:32] these are beings
[31:35] amen they're not
[31:41] Angels can't you see that when we get
[31:43] there what a worship time we're going to
[31:45] be having am
[31:48] yes and we're not those angels that are

[42:21] let's see what these combat beats really
[42:22] are go ahead
[42:25] brother B
[42:27] I think he's on post
[42:32] today look what brother R says on the
[42:34] fifth seal now I ask you to just read
[42:36] the fifth seal you're going to read a
[42:39] big portion of you here but I just ask
[42:40] you to read
[42:44] it this is 1963 322 the fifth seal
[42:48] paragraph
[42:50] 88 the four stages of his writer has
[42:53] been revealed now you know what he means
[42:54] by that cuz he's been he's done preached
[42:56] four SE and this is the
[42:58] thft there's no combat beast on the thft
[43:02] you don't have to have one because the L
[43:04] one was The Eagle right the four stages
[43:07] of the Antichrist riter has been
[43:08] revealed at this
[43:10] time look at it the four stages of the
[43:15] Antichrist the four stages of the
[43:17] Antichrist as well as this four stages
[43:18] of Jesus Christ and you know what people
[43:20] this message will say four is a number
[43:22] of antichrist and they won't have Jesus
[43:25] Christ to have four they only have to
[43:28] have
[43:29] three you better read uh what is it
[43:35] uh slipping I'll get it in a minute
[43:38] where brother M explains the the theorm
[43:42] palor locus caterpillar uh brid tree
[43:46] restoration he covers four that right he
[43:49] covers justification sanctification the
[43:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the word
[43:53] amen amen but four is Antichrist number
[43:56] four Jesus Christ number two
[43:59] amen I a't having that for Antichrist
[44:02] I've been taught that all my life well
[44:04] all your life you've been
[44:07] wrong there was four living creatures of
[44:10] God to announce the writer as they wrote
[44:12] four Beast or four powers now we know
[44:15] that Beast by interpretation of the
[44:16] terms of the Bible symbols means
[44:19] power now let's get that close the four
[44:22] be four are beast in the Bible represent
[44:24] the power among the people right I
[44:28] didn't say Mr the church age messenger
[44:30] only right among the people all
[44:36] right now if we find out like in Daniel
[44:39] when he saw a certain Nation rise up it
[44:41] would be maybe a bar holding a rib in
[44:42] his side symbol then he seen another
[44:45] Power raise up goat and it represented
[44:48] something then he seen another Power
[44:50] raise up up and and it was a leopard
[44:53] with so many heads it represented
[44:55] certain Kingdom then he saw another one
[44:58] rise up and a great Lon with the teeth
[45:01] and the STP the residue that represented
[45:04] a different Power representing what a
[45:07] different Power all together see coming
[45:09] down one was a was a kingdom of
[45:12] Nebuchadnezzar and another type because
[45:14] you remember the dream of Daniel coming
[45:16] down in his his dreams and all was
[45:18] correct but what is it it's a power
[45:20] among the people right
[45:24] now there are two different kind of
[45:28] beast in the Book of Revelation go ahead
[45:30] and pull up the next one cuz we got a we
[45:32] got a 1 a 2 a 2 a all
[45:38] right there's two different kinds of
[45:40] Beast you say well I know that that's
[45:41] right but these people out here on some
[45:42] of these ain't never heard some of maybe
[45:44] cuz maybe they're this year in the first
[45:46] time and they don't know so maybe it's
[45:47] interest in people enough to do it and
[45:49] if you say you know all about it then
[45:50] you're the person I'm talking about you
[45:51] don't know all
[45:53] about
[45:54] okay you hurt my feelings good
[45:59] we'll do some praying amen it'll help
[46:03] why you there pray for me all right
[46:05] Revelation chapter 4 I just pull this
[46:08] part off because it was a long reading
[46:11] and it goes ahead and describes a beast
[46:13] which we'll get to in a minute now the
[46:14] Beast here is
[46:17] represented have you got a marginal
[46:19] reading in your Bible on on Beast if you
[46:21] have get over in the marginal reading
[46:23] the notice Dr Scofield here has it
[46:25] marked out in his the Beast means he's
[46:27] got over here saying living
[46:30] creatures oh my now watch the Greek word
[46:34] there is z o o m r o r z o
[46:40] n it is
[46:42] zou now in the Greek it's called Zoom
[46:45] which means a
[46:48] creature now it isn't so if you want to
[46:51] read it now we haven't got time I was
[46:53] going to read it but I haven't put down
[46:56] but I have it put down Revelations 1113
[47:00] now he's giving you this one this is
[47:02] zoom all right Revelations 11131
[47:05] 17 where there where Beast is the
[47:09] chapters in Revelations 11 13117 is
[47:12] called the beast the same
[47:15] way but the Beast dire interpretation is
[47:19] t h e r i o n Theon the word Greek word
[47:24] there Theon which means means a wild
[47:27] untameable beast
[47:31] y
[47:32] now we're talking about the combat Beast
[47:35] the two different ones the zoom is the
[47:38] bride now what's a simple answer to this
[47:46] Theon now get ready to get your feelings
[47:48] hurt because of what he says but you're
[47:50] going to get it hurt in him all right
[47:52] watch it the Greek word Theon which
[47:55] means a wild Untamed Beast Theon that
[47:58] means a wild unimed beast and zoon means
[48:02] a creature see four living Zoom
[48:05] creatures not the Beast of wild Theon
[48:08] but Zoom living creatures and Theon is
[48:11] wild Untamed
[48:17] Savages oh that's over in Africa back in
[48:19] them jungles man you just see them you
[48:22] can see them Indians out y you can just
[48:24] see them up y uh come on you done read
[48:28] it probably before I get to it anyway
[48:30] and Theon is wild un Savages in other
[48:33] words if you watch the 11th
[48:36] chapter the Beast of Rome the 13th
[48:39] chapter the United States
[48:42] y the 17th chapter both United States
[48:46] and
[48:47] Rome of the denominational churches
[48:50] Consolidated with the ca Catholicism
[48:53] making them an
[48:55] unconverted
[48:57] Untamed to the gospel pleas
[49:03] Untamed now boy you ain't got big old
[49:05] Savages there has
[49:08] you they sitting in churches right
[49:13] amen denominationalism that's right
[49:17] tying together with
[49:20] Catholicism and he calls him a Theon
[49:22] that's what the Bible calls him a Theon
[49:24] untameable unconverted he says right
[49:27] amen but now those are good people
[49:29] brother Dale
[49:31] amen right y that ain't got anything to
[49:34] do with
[49:35] Christianity
[49:41] right think about
[49:43] it how simple a prophet can make
[49:46] it that's what these Theon beasts
[49:51] are
[49:52] yep
[49:55] huh
[49:58] how about in this message how many the
[49:59] UN beast in this message are untimed
[50:02] unconvertible
[50:04] well brother Dale you're just so
[50:06] hard-headed I agree with you ain't got
[50:09] no
[50:11] problem but now there's just one Bible
[50:15] there's just one
[50:17] truth now if I'm off that you come and
[50:19] show
[50:21] me if I miss that you come and show me
[50:24] where I missed you amen but if not my

[50:38] these days that's all right never had
[50:40] one time on the internet since we've
[50:42] been doing it for somebody to really
[50:44] challenge me on what I've
[50:47] taught sure a brother challenged me and
[50:49] said I didn't know I didn't understand
[50:51] what this other brother
[50:54] T I just quoted what he said say
[50:59] it and I've never answered the man back
[51:02] and will not because I'm not going to
[51:04] argue over internet now if he wants to
[51:05] come to my home I'll be glad to talk to
[51:08] him be sure I would I would love for him
[51:11] to come just sit down and talk with me a
[51:12] few days you
[51:15] know but I'm not going to argue with
[51:17] nobody about what this is or that is but
[51:19] come and show me where I'm off the word
[51:21] amen I ain't talking about what I would
[51:24] misunderstand what some brother had said
[51:25] on a tape
[51:27] don't show me where I'm off the
[51:28] scripture you say well that make you
[51:30] something no but it makes a great
[51:35] God 40s something years and we don't
[51:38] know what brother randam has taught yeah
[51:41] come
[51:42] on that's right what's the matter what
[51:44] have you been reading that's
[51:49] right come on
[51:52] church now let's start reading okay
[51:57] we're going to be reading from the fifth
[51:58] seal so we'll just start with paragraph
[52:01] 113 and we're going to be reading for
[52:03] quite a
[52:05] while there will be a few little Scouts
[52:08] in it but not
[52:10] much they do I'll tell you when it
[52:13] changes okay paragraph 113 1963 322
[52:17] fifth seal notice as the Antichrist went
[52:19] forth on his Beast of ministry there God
[52:22] sent forth a beast to combat
[52:24] it now once then every time the Beast
[52:27] rode on his horse the Antichrist rode on
[52:29] his horse on his Beast to announce his
[52:34] ministry God sent forth his Beast also
[52:37] in his own mask I love
[52:41] that to announce his combat to
[52:46] it i' underline that announce to about
[52:49] two Services down now the scripture
[52:52] says when the enemy you say you say
[52:55] things so once in a while just off the
[52:56] top of your hat if you write them top of
[52:58] the hats down you might find out one of
[53:01] these days I really meant I wish you'd
[53:03] write that
[53:06] down it may Happ
[53:09] you now the scripture says when the
[53:11] enemy comes in like a flood the spirit
[53:13] of God raised standard against and so
[53:15] when the enemy went out as an antichrist
[53:17] God sent a certain type of power out to
[53:20] meet him and then when they he went out
[53:24] again as a red horse rider another color
[53:27] another Power another Ministry God sent
[53:30] another one after him to combat it to
[53:33] combat it to hold his
[53:36] church remember that sent the third one
[53:40] again God sent his third Beast to come
[53:43] and to announce it see that will cover
[53:46] when we get in the seal announce the
[53:48] opening of the
[53:49] seal he sent the fourth one God sent his
[53:53] fourth one and then the
[53:55] Antichrist in
[53:57] and the church ages ended to it at that
[54:00] time oh watch this is really
[54:03] good
[54:08] now we go up to
[54:12] 119 I said most of these are continual
[54:16] reading now we see that the devil
[54:18] changing four before Beast meant that
[54:22] what power they was revealed to the what
[54:25] power he revealed to the
[54:27] world now he's talking about the devil
[54:29] revealing a power not talking about God
[54:32] revealing a power
[54:34] y he revealed the world and how they
[54:37] ended on this pale de horse oh let's
[54:41] look at God's power of these beasts to
[54:43] combat them the first Beast of God that
[54:45] went out to meet the Antichrist was the
[54:47] the Antichrist Spirit when it said it's
[54:49] just his teaching now remember when the
[54:52] Antichrist first wrote he was in a
[54:53] Teaching Ministry the Antichrist first
[54:56] roote in a Teaching Ministry and watch
[54:59] the one that went out to meet him the
[55:01] lion the lion of the tribe of Judah
[55:03] which is the word when the false
[55:05] teaching went forth the true word went
[55:07] out to meet him that's the reason we had
[55:10] an irenius and a
[55:12] polycar you notice he ain't Nam Paul
[55:17] yet it's a combat among the
[55:21] people that's my point
[55:24] see and those fell St Martin when that
[55:28] Antichrist was writing with his false
[55:29] teaching God sent his teaching out the
[55:33] word the line of the tribe of Judah
[55:36] which is the word made manifest in the
[55:39] Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit there to
[55:41] manifest himself which is the
[55:46] word that's the reason the early church
[55:48] had healings and miracles and visions
[55:50] and power is because it was the Living
[55:53] Word in the in the
[55:57] form of the line of the tribe of Judah
[55:59] riding out to combat that amen now you
[56:02] got it he sends his power Antichrist God
[56:05] sends his power the word Antichrist
[56:07] false teaching the true teaching went
[56:09] with it to combat it now that was the
[56:12] first one now this was the first church
[56:15] Apostolic that went to meet
[56:17] him so if you just follow the paragraph
[56:20] down now the second beast that the
[56:23] Antichrist sent out was a red Beast
[56:26] which was a that he wrote on was to take
[56:28] peace from the earth and War you going
[56:30] to see a book you find out it was
[56:32] killing you know and that's when the 68
[56:33] million started to be killed of the
[56:35] Bride not the the Jews now that was 6
[56:38] million Jews that was killed by and
[56:40] Hitler in war now the second one that
[56:43] went to combat him was the ox Beast the
[56:45] o means a labor a beast of burden now if
[56:48] we just stop just a minute let me
[56:51] get let just so you be sure to meet this
[56:55] that's the
[56:57] kind might that's that's the kind might
[57:00] be a little
[57:01] puzzling to you let us get T Tara over
[57:07] here watch and see if it isn't a a
[57:10] laboring
[57:12] church all right now look back
[57:17] behind do you see where tar is at the
[57:20] four Church
[57:23] age all right now that's where you're op
[57:25] and you start losing 68 million starts
[57:27] being killed it was killed down before
[57:29] then so then your line Ministry liced
[57:32] three Church agents right yes as a
[57:35] matter of fact in the four Church ages
[57:36] when the lon Ministry went into the
[57:38] ground that was your corn of wheat that
[57:40] was falling into the ground
[57:43] y that was what Jesus speaking of let's
[57:45] a corn of whe Di and fall into the
[57:48] ground and ab alone right that pure
[57:51] unadulterated word brother Brown said
[57:54] there was nobody greater than under
[57:56] standing than St Martin outside of Paul
[58:00] himself
[58:01] right St Martin had signs in wonders in
[58:04] his church the dead raised the sick
[58:07] healed and wouldn't be satisfied himmer
[58:10] Columbo one wouldn't be satisfied until
[58:12] everybody in the church had the baptism
[58:14] of the Holy Ghost and signs and wonders
[58:15] followed so the pure under alterated
[58:18] word
[58:19] lasted for ages and started going into
[58:21] the ground at
[58:23] Tiara as an ox right that's why it
[58:26] changed to an oxx because it it became
[58:30] out in the Dark Ages the where that they
[58:31] were killing in the thing going up
[58:33] paragraph
[58:35] 129 see that shows that the Taran age
[58:38] after the Antichrist got settled down
[58:39] and it came into a Taran age the little
[58:42] church could do nothing but just just
[58:44] simply
[58:45] labor and another thing the ox is a also
[58:49] is a beast of sacrifice see they gave
[58:51] their life just as freely as they could
[58:53] give them in the Dark Ages A Thousand
[58:55] Years D the Catholicism control the
[58:57] world and you just went right in yes or
[59:00] no they didn't mind dying it was death
[59:04] that's all right they went and died
[59:07] anyhow why the SP very Spirit of the
[59:11] age now that's not just a messenger
[59:13] right right first one is the word next
[59:16] one is the ox is not just a man one
[59:20] person right why does everybody want to
[59:22] go to the end of it and just say brother
[59:23] around I'm the
[59:24] evil we could here in just a minute when
[59:26] brother around said when the Eagles th
[59:28] Roll
[59:34] come he uses the word
[59:36] Eagles PL cuz I thought we were supposed
[59:39] to be Eagles I thought we were supposed
[59:41] to be little
[59:43] Messiah I thought we had a certain
[59:45] position watch what I watch when he gets
[59:48] into this
[59:49] now the very Spirit of the age that's
[59:52] the reason then that's the reason irus
[59:55] that's reion polycarp John Paul those
[59:58] great mighty men out there combating
[1:00:00] that thing Paul saw it he said I know
[1:00:02] that after my
[1:00:04] departing that wolves are going to enter
[1:00:07] in among you Brethren teaching reverse
[1:00:10] things it'll draw you away all right 131
[1:00:14] keep going so it's just a continuation
[1:00:17] we just keep reading you just read the
[1:00:19] paragraph
[1:00:20] number and you'll stay right where we're
[1:00:22] at just go jumps over to paragraph 140
[1:00:25] now
[1:00:26] and I'm going to set this box up here to
[1:00:28] represent that if God sends a certain
[1:00:30] Spirit among them that's the only thing
[1:00:32] that they can work by is the spirit that
[1:00:34] works among them that's right he said
[1:00:37] those people in the Dark Ages they give
[1:00:39] their life freely that's right cuz that
[1:00:41] was the spirit right amen you realize if
[1:00:44] they hadn't went to the ground we
[1:00:45] wouldn't be here that's right that's
[1:00:48] right if they hadn't to went the ground
[1:00:50] we wouldn't be here
[1:00:54] right you know you know Jesus Jesus is
[1:00:57] the word that's who they were and we'll
[1:01:00] prove to you by the history of the
[1:01:01] church and by the opening of the seals
[1:01:02] and the powers that let loose what
[1:01:05] exactly the church rep responded to the
[1:01:07] anointing and they couldn't do nothing
[1:01:10] else that's right we can't help being
[1:01:12] what we are that's right you know I mean
[1:01:15] you may think that we're against
[1:01:16] organized religion we're against the
[1:01:18] denominated
[1:01:19] no we're the only people that's not
[1:01:21] against them they're against each other
[1:01:23] fighting like crazy now I admit now % of
[1:01:26] the preachers this Mage is them
[1:01:28] denomination is fighting yeah come on
[1:01:32] right but it's ain't called Methodist
[1:01:33] and
[1:01:34] Baptist but I'm not fighting against
[1:01:36] nobody I want to see everybody amen but
[1:01:39] I just know they can't that's right but
[1:01:42] if they don't have the new birth they
[1:01:43] can't see what you're talking about
[1:01:45] that's
[1:01:46] right that's why it's no good to
[1:01:50] argue the first was the line that roared
[1:01:52] that pure and adulterating word the
[1:01:54] second in tar was the o
[1:01:56] and it was a burden a beast of burden
[1:01:58] pardon me and it was also a sacrificial
[1:02:00] beast and wasn't that exactly the poor
[1:02:03] little Church of Rome that settled down
[1:02:04] there to A Thousand Years of Dark Ages
[1:02:07] and anything that didn't profess to be
[1:02:09] the Roman Church was put to death
[1:02:11] immediately and they had
[1:02:13] labor go from place to place all
[1:02:21] right we jump to 145 let just continue
[1:02:27] they didn't care because the spirit of
[1:02:28] the church in that day was sacrificing
[1:02:30] we got that no no they didn't care
[1:02:33] because the spirit of the church in that
[1:02:35] day was sacrifice labor and they walked
[1:02:37] up just as freely as they could walk
[1:02:39] Anointed with the true spirit of God of
[1:02:41] that age and died like Heroes of
[1:02:44] sacrifice
[1:02:45] thousands times thousands 68 million of
[1:02:48] them on the record o sacrifice that's
[1:02:51] the catholic's on record that's right oh
[1:02:53] my do you understand it okay all right
[1:02:56] now the sacrifice it only could labor in
[1:02:59] that age to comeb back the great
[1:03:01] opposition for that 1,000 years now the
[1:03:05] third Beast that went from the devil was
[1:03:08] this black
[1:03:09] horse now remember Theon black horse
[1:03:14] right see now the third Beast that went
[1:03:16] out power from God to combat him come
[1:03:20] back the powers of the black horse was a
[1:03:22] man cunning smart with the wisdom of God
[1:03:26] you know a man is the smarter than any
[1:03:28] of the Beast see he's smarter cuz he can
[1:03:31] outwit him mostly he's cunning RW and
[1:03:35] he's the the age from the Dark Age now
[1:03:38] coming out from the Dark Age down to
[1:03:41] this other side where this black horse
[1:03:44] was riding when they charged for their
[1:03:46] their their sacrifice and everything
[1:03:49] they done and money was just oh you know
[1:03:51] how it
[1:03:53] was now the next when out to combat that
[1:03:57] was a beast with the face of a man smart
[1:03:59] educated shrewd fine Anointed with that
[1:04:02] Spirit of that day you notice he went to
[1:04:05] combat him with a kindness of God's
[1:04:07] wisdom with him y that was the age of
[1:04:09] the Reformation Martin Luther John
[1:04:11] Wesley and so forth it was the
[1:04:13] reformation ziggle and oh who all Knox
[1:04:17] Calvin and who all see went out and it
[1:04:19] was cunningness brother Brenham you know
[1:04:21] how Calvin was a rascal had a man put to
[1:04:23] death for leaving in but yet he still in
[1:04:25] there right
[1:04:28] sure you said oh he's not you going to
[1:04:30] argue with God about it because there
[1:04:32] was no way to understand in that day
[1:04:34] right amen all right you just fuss with
[1:04:35] him not with me watch from the Dark Age
[1:04:38] of reformation this way it was the
[1:04:40] shrewdness of
[1:04:41] man but notice it was a shrewdness of
[1:04:44] man now do you understand the third
[1:04:46] Beast that Satan went out he become
[1:04:48] shrew too now here Satan right a measure
[1:04:52] of wheat for a penny three measures of
[1:04:54] barley for a penny oh oh my see oh
[1:04:58] my see the money-making scheme the
[1:05:01] shrewdness to get the gold of the world
[1:05:04] and the wealth brought into
[1:05:07] it like Terence told us we were all
[1:05:11] dummies when we come in this message
[1:05:13] gold was probably $35 an
[1:05:17] ounce you realize if You' have made a
[1:05:20] $11,000
[1:05:22] investment at $35 an ounce
[1:05:26] now it's
[1:05:28] what between $6 $1,800 an
[1:05:32] ounce we just wouldn't smart
[1:05:35] enough we should have put everything we
[1:05:37] had in
[1:05:39] gold now we got it all in paper yeah you
[1:05:44] know paper
[1:05:46] burns yeah gold on yeah Bank notes all
[1:05:50] in okay get out of it the moneymaking
[1:05:54] scheme the r is to get the gold of the
[1:05:57] world and the wealth brought into it
[1:05:59] that's exactly the full field that's
[1:06:02] what begin to charge for prayers and for

[1:10:25] it my in church where we're going to you
[1:10:27] won't hear him preaching about
[1:10:29] TI the only time the man came and I
[1:10:32] preached on
[1:10:34] TI but I preach on tithing your time and
[1:10:38] your
[1:10:39] talents and your things right right but
[1:10:43] if I got to say something to you about
[1:10:45] paying your tithe forgive it yeah that's
[1:10:47] right Church ain't never been build on
[1:10:49] but other people is buil on what God
[1:10:51] will give us you don't believe it all
[1:10:54] notice the Beast come to come back it
[1:10:56] was Martin Luther and the different but
[1:10:58] where where was it don't you see those
[1:11:00] evangelists this day would still have
[1:11:02] the same anointing on this day still
[1:11:04] have the same anointing on them making
[1:11:06] old people give up their pensions and
[1:11:08] needing their homes over to certain
[1:11:10] things my brother I I don't want to get
[1:11:13] on
[1:11:15] that he said it was the same anointing y
[1:11:22] right now that's hard to think about
[1:11:24] isn't it
[1:11:28] the same thing that would make a
[1:11:29] preacher pull for
[1:11:32] money you know that brother random fired
[1:11:34] campaign
[1:11:36] managers because they pull for
[1:11:40] money that's right you want me to get
[1:11:42] back there and find some names for
[1:11:45] you he fired them because they pull for
[1:11:47] money that's right these were preachers
[1:11:51] especially one of
[1:11:54] them
[1:11:56] we just think about
[1:11:58] it that shrewd
[1:12:03] anointing we're sitting in a church one
[1:12:05] time and this brother got up took up and
[1:12:07] offered brother Woodby he knew all about
[1:12:09] those type of things CU he'd been down
[1:12:11] through there that man hadn't sent five
[1:12:13] words and all of you know his name
[1:12:15] personally but he said five words and
[1:12:17] brother Wy plucked me in the ribs that
[1:12:19] he knows what he's doing I said you
[1:12:23] watching we said in a meeting up at Ruth
[1:12:26] one time and a man got up there and got
[1:12:28] $10,000 in one
[1:12:36] offering you don't known how to
[1:12:41] pull oh no we're not the days now when
[1:12:43] they threaten to burn your Barns and and
[1:12:45] your Stop's going to die and you
[1:12:48] no well we we don't do
[1:12:53] that but what's the difference in seven
[1:12:56] tenants and things that's right
[1:13:01] right do you understand
[1:13:05] yes this was on the Antichrist anointing
[1:13:10] down through there and it's still here
[1:13:11] now but remember the Antichrist gets off
[1:13:14] of one horse gets on another one he on
[1:13:16] end he gets off that horse gets on
[1:13:18] another you know that horse don't die
[1:13:20] and go
[1:13:21] away that horse just follows him up
[1:13:23] follows him up at the end he's riding on
[1:13:25] all four horses that's right right
[1:13:28] that's right he riding them all down the
[1:13:30] entr what you think about okay
[1:13:33] right the Beast come to combat there was
[1:13:36] a man and we allow that this Beast of
[1:13:38] man this power of man in his
[1:13:41] intellectuals recognize that that
[1:13:44] kosher that Martin Luther had in his
[1:13:46] hand when he was climbing those steps he
[1:13:49] said this is the body of the Lord Jesus
[1:13:52] this is the the blood of the Lord of
[1:13:54] Jesus Jus Christ this is the body of
[1:13:56] Jesus Christ and Luther throw it down
[1:13:59] and said it's Bread and Wine it's not
[1:14:02] the body of Christ because he been
[1:14:04] exalted to the right hand it was a man
[1:14:06] did that come out under amen a
[1:14:09] shrewdness of a man John Wesley come
[1:14:12] along after zingle and come in and
[1:14:15] Calvin and he got and he got the church
[1:14:18] to a place on
[1:14:21] security that they didn't want any more
[1:14:24] revivals
[1:14:28] Y no Revol turn
[1:14:31] over worldwide is right we agree but not
[1:14:35] in your heart right no way I'm in a
[1:14:38] Revival stay in one whatever is going to
[1:14:41] be is going to be that was all of it you
[1:14:44] know if they got so bad they wouldn't
[1:14:45] take their kids to church because they
[1:14:47] afraid they might get converted when God
[1:14:48] didn't want him to be you know that's a
[1:14:50] Baptist
[1:14:52] Doctrine more less the the independent
[1:14:56] afraid they might get saved when God
[1:14:57] didn't want to save them now ain't that
[1:15:01] D I try to get away use that word stupid
[1:15:04] that's right they just lived any kind of
[1:15:06] lives the Lutheran Church was so twisted
[1:15:08] and the England Church oh my the whole
[1:15:10] country became
[1:15:11] corrupt now this is what under a combat
[1:15:15] be just like it is now a church is
[1:15:17] Twisted when King Henry the the E come
[1:15:21] into England and after Bloody Mar and
[1:15:23] all of these things take place and then
[1:15:26] the church was so full of violence and
[1:15:29] Corruption men claiming Christianity and
[1:15:31] living with four or five wives are doing
[1:15:34] anything they wanted to do and crying on
[1:15:37] in filth and what it come back John
[1:15:41] Wesley studying the scripture and
[1:15:42] watching it it was revealed to him that
[1:15:44] the blood of Jesus Christ sanctifies the
[1:15:46] believer amen and you shouldn't then
[1:15:48] what did he do he come out with another
[1:15:51] Reformation he saved the world in his
[1:15:53] day like Luther did what was it the man
[1:15:56] be power going on he G the wisdom of
[1:15:58] understanding that the thing is wrong
[1:16:00] right keep on going where we at
[1:16:09] on let's just cut it off there
[1:16:13] because we'll do this one but we'll cut
[1:16:15] it
[1:16:17] off notice how Satan shely pulled that
[1:16:21] we see at that time upon the man's being
[1:16:24] God put a spirit wisdom upon man to
[1:16:26] understand that's wrong now that was to
[1:16:28] combat the third Beast that had got the
[1:16:30] church so corrupt that he was writing
[1:16:32] that it was terrible the reformers what
[1:16:34] did they do then they in the reformers
[1:16:36] age they brought the church from its
[1:16:38] pagan ceremonies of idolatry back to God
[1:16:41] again see that's what the Beast went on
[1:16:44] and the kindness of man riding to do it
[1:16:48] all right let's cut off right there
[1:16:50] because if I keep on we get into the to
[1:16:52] the eagle with is it's too late it's
[1:16:54] sorry 5 to 4 I didn't mean to go that
[1:16:57] long but
[1:16:59] listen we'll review a little bit and
[1:17:01] pick up Wednesday
[1:17:04] night these combat beasts that you read
[1:17:06] in Revelations
[1:17:09] 4 they cast their throne their crowns
[1:17:13] you know the things before the one on
[1:17:15] the
[1:17:16] throne they're not the Angelic beings
[1:17:19] that fly through Heaven just singing
[1:17:21] Holy Holy Holy they're the ones that
[1:17:23] came from Earth
[1:17:26] that really know how to
[1:17:28] worship and which one do you think God
[1:17:30] would want to hear crying holy holy holy
[1:17:33] right now there's Angels around him how
[1:17:35] that means I don't understand surely
[1:17:37] they're not just holy holy holy holy
[1:17:38] holy holy holy holy holy now brother
[1:17:40] George Canada had a good point one time
[1:17:42] and I agree with it was a good point he
[1:17:44] said you know they said them Angels they
[1:17:46] look at him they say holy holy holy he
[1:17:47] said didn't they see him said they see
[1:17:49] something exra about him you know
[1:17:50] greater and they say holy holy holy said
[1:17:51] every time they say it said they see
[1:17:53] something greater that's wonderful and
[1:17:55] that could go on for millions of
[1:17:57] years but you know what sister Gail God
[1:17:59] had rather hear you and I and our
[1:18:02] squeaky old worn out voices sister G
[1:18:06] used to sing like a LK she still can but
[1:18:10] kind of gets broke up
[1:18:13] sometime you
[1:18:17] know but God would rather hear that than
[1:18:19] hear all those other Angels that's
[1:18:23] correct
[1:18:25] because they don't know how to sing Holy
[1:18:27] Holy Holy
[1:18:28] no it's only the one who's been to Earth
[1:18:32] and realize how sinful we are amen
[1:18:35] that's right that we can cry holy holy
[1:18:39] holy Lord God Almighty amen true if you
[1:18:43] hadn't to come where would we
[1:18:45] be if you hadn't paid the price where
[1:18:47] would we be
[1:18:49] yes won't be no problem then will they
[1:18:53] right let's Stand Together come on
[1:18:56] Brothers I'll pick it up Wednesday and
[1:18:58] just continue the thought on cuz I think
[1:19:00] you're getting the point of what I want
[1:19:01] you to see the combat Beast is in the
[1:19:04] people
[1:19:07] right it's the spirit of God Among the
[1:19:10] people yep that's manifesting
[1:19:14] itself and in doing that then we're part
[1:19:17] of
[1:19:19] it so when we read Wednesday we get down
[1:19:21] to where brother R said when the Eagles
[1:19:23] plural come
[1:19:27] many
[1:19:29] Eagles
[1:19:31] come man years
[1:19:34] ago he said brother Rand just come to
[1:19:36] make way for the prophets you know what
[1:19:39] I didn't get mad at him because he said
[1:19:40] that I'd read the
[1:19:43] book but when I questioned him about
[1:19:45] what he was talking about
[1:19:48] yeah brother how can remember we were
[1:19:51] sitting out at the old blue Bo Cafe and
[1:19:54] come find out the man wound up
[1:19:56] believing a gentile bride and a gentile
[1:20:00] Prophet would be the two witnesses go to
[1:20:02] Israel of course you know who the
[1:20:05] Gentile Prophet
[1:20:07] was
[1:20:10] him so I just told
[1:20:13] him I said according to the Bible and
[1:20:16] according to brother
[1:20:18] randam God will only receive two
[1:20:22] prophets that are Jews that's right
[1:20:28] mhm he said you don't believe it could
[1:20:30] be a gentile bride and a gentile Prophet
[1:20:32] I said no sir don't believe
[1:20:37] it see church at least we could
[1:20:42] combat brother R said I'll be glad the
[1:20:44] time comes that they'll look people in
[1:20:46] the eye and say you're not saying what
[1:20:47] Paul
[1:20:50] said now what was he
[1:20:53] saying no would you think he was
[1:20:55] speaking there ought to be a Time come
[1:20:57] that somebody would say you ain't saying
[1:20:58] what brother R
[1:21:02] saying but the ones that ain't saying
[1:21:04] what brother around and said are more
[1:21:06] popular yeah because that's the spirit
[1:21:09] in them
[1:21:12] that's
[1:21:14] right that's the spirit in them it's the
[1:21:17] spirit in the people remember Brother
[1:21:19] Gary was here he'd say Amen to
[1:21:21] this you know that Beast can only do is
[1:21:24] give him power that's right that
[1:21:27] zoom
[1:21:29] zoom which is Christ all right but that
[1:21:33] thron can do nothing if we don't give
[1:21:35] him our
[1:21:38] powers so which one we going to give it
[1:21:40] to that's right go ahead one got amen
[1:21:43] anybody have a
[1:21:53] name
[1:21:57] the anybody have
[1:21:59] a which Beast are
