[17:09] and uh um he really enjoyed his time his
[17:13] himself here him and his family and um
[17:16] and you all helped make that possible
[17:19] for him as well but ever since that ever
[17:22] since he was a little kid he wanted was
[17:25] one of his dreams to be able to go to
[17:26] Jefferson Ville Indiana and thank God we
[17:29] were able to be part of that so that was
[17:33] he he he he literally said that he he
[17:36] was laying next to his wife in the bed
[17:38] there at the hotel where we were staying
[17:40] at in Louisville Kentucky and he said he
[17:44] told her he said I can't believe this is
[17:45] actually
[17:47] happening now you see to them it's like
[17:49] it's a big thing you know but for us
[17:52] it's just a common old Jeffersonville
[17:54] you know where God did such great
[17:57] wonderful things
[17:59] that but yet we forget about it but for
[18:01] them they keep that down there alive
[18:05] they keep it because they've never seen
[18:06] it but you and I that have seen it we
[18:09] just say oh it's just common you know
[18:13] it's unfortunate you know it's
[18:15] unfortunate I wish we we would keep and
[18:17] and you know that happens to me too I'm
[18:19] not saying it's just you all this
[18:20] happens to me it just get we get we come
[18:23] to church and everything just seems
[18:25] common but you know when you haven't
[18:27] experienced it amen and and you haven't
[18:29] really you know seen it you know for
[18:32] yourself you know it's something new
[18:34] it's something fresh so y'all just pray
[18:37] for them and uh pray for brother Eric
[18:39] continue help him in his ministry down
[18:42] there amen that there is a lot of work
[18:44] to do down there so y'all just remember
[18:46] them in prayer let's turn to Judges
[18:49] chapter 6 uh let's let's and we're going
[18:53] to start at verse one we're going to
[18:54] talk a little bit about Gideon this this
[18:56] evening and I want to titled is God's
[18:59] calling you out of your comfort zone how
[19:02] many believe that God is doing that in
[19:03] this hour the closer we get to the
[19:06] coming of the Lord the easier things are
[19:09] not going to get that's right let me say
[19:12] that again the closer we get to the
[19:14] coming of the Lord the harder things are
[19:15] going to
[19:16] get and just expect
[19:19] it but God is trying to do something in
[19:22] our lives whether it's through sickness
[19:25] whether it's through family issues or
[19:27] whether it's through financial issues
[19:29] the economy the the the the gas prices
[19:33] Whatever It Is God is squeezing the best
[19:36] out of you because he knows it's in
[19:39] there if you've got the Holy Ghost so so
[19:43] so he will send whatever he's he he will
[19:46] in order to squeeze what he knows your
[19:49] potentials are amen praise the Lord so
[19:51] let's just bow our heads before we read
[19:53] our heavenly father we thank you Lord
[19:55] Jesus once again for the opportunity
[19:56] that we have to open back the page pages
[19:58] of your word we realize Lord that we're
[20:00] insufficient within ourselves father and
[20:03] we just ask that you'd have your way
[20:04] this evening Lord speak through my lips
[20:06] Lord and and and help us Lord to receive
[20:09] something from you encourage us father
[20:11] and Lord help us father to just move
[20:13] forward Lord God and no matter what the
[20:16] obstacles may come Lord God lord we are
[20:19] we are people that are focused father
[20:21] focused on you Lord Jesus focused on
[20:23] your word focus on the end goal Lord
[20:25] Jesus and we just pray that you'd help
[20:27] us all bless each and everyone here meet
[20:30] every need amongst us Lord God even as
[20:32] the word Goes Forth heal those sick
[20:34] bodies Lord father meet whatever the
[20:36] need is father as the word is going
[20:38] forth and I just commit myself into your
[20:40] hands now father in Jesus Christ's name
[20:43] amen amen amen uh Judges chapter 1 or
[20:49] chapter 6 I'm sorry here's here and the
[20:52] children of Israel did evil in the sight
[20:55] of the Lord and the Lord delivered them
[20:57] into the hand hand of Midian 7even years
[21:00] and the Hand of Midian prevailed against
[21:04] Israel and because of the midianites the
[21:08] children of Israel made them the dens
[21:11] which are in the mountains and caves and
[21:14] strongholds and so it was when Israel
[21:17] had sown that the midianites came up and
[21:19] the amalekites and the children of of
[21:22] the East even they came up against them
[21:25] and they encamped against them and
[21:27] destroyed the in increase of the earth
[21:29] till Thou come unto Gaza and left no
[21:33] sustenance for Israel neither sheep nor
[21:36] Ox nor ass can you imagine that the
[21:39] children of Israel were there planting
[21:42] and living out their Liv daily lives and
[21:45] because they got so comfortable with
[21:47] their daily living amen they started
[21:51] worshiping
[21:52] Idols let me let me dab in let me dab
[21:55] with this in my life let me let's do
[21:57] this and it come something else became
[21:59] their God and so God said I'm not going
[22:02] to share my glory with anybody else so
[22:04] he allowed the midianites to come in and
[22:06] take everything that they had to a point
[22:09] where they were building caves in order
[22:11] to hide from
[22:13] them for they came up with their cattle
[22:17] and their tents and they came as
[22:18] grasshoppers for multitude for both they
[22:21] and their camels were without number
[22:24] this the amount of the uh uh uh median
[22:26] ites and they enter Ed into the land to
[22:29] destroy
[22:30] it I wonder if that isn't what's
[22:33] happening in in the in the US
[22:37] today and Israel was greatly
[22:39] impoverished because of the midianites
[22:41] and the children of Israel Cried unto
[22:44] the Lord and that's where God wants want
[22:46] wanted them to be and it came to pass
[22:49] when the children of Israel Cried unto
[22:51] the Lord because of the midianites that
[22:53] the Lord sent a prophet unto the
[22:56] children of Israel which said unto them
[22:58] thus say the Lord God of Israel I
[23:00] brought you up from Egypt and brought
[23:02] you forth out of the house of bondage
[23:05] let's let's skip down to verse number
[23:09] 11 and there came an angel of the Lord
[23:12] and sat under an oak which was in oah
[23:16] and P and pertained unto joash the
[23:18] abizer and his son Gideon threshed Wheat
[23:23] by the wine press to hide it from the
[23:26] midianites
[23:28] Gideon was in his comfort
[23:32] zone that's all he needed to
[23:34] do he was in his comfort zone just like
[23:37] many of us we're just in our comfort
[23:39] zone as long as I know if I just keep
[23:42] doing this I'm protected just keep doing
[23:46] this but see God had something planned
[23:48] for
[23:49] him amen and the angel of the Lord
[23:52] appeared unto him and said unto him the
[23:54] Lord is with thee thou Mighty Man of
[23:56] Valor amen with that you may be seated
[23:59] praise God you know I I I often think
[24:03] about this scripture how here's
[24:06] Gideon and you have to remember the
[24:09] setting of this of of of this story is
[24:12] that the children of Israel were already
[24:15] in the promised
[24:18] land think about that the children of
[24:21] Israel were already in their promised
[24:22] land this was after after Joshua this
[24:25] was after and so it was the time of the
[24:28] judges where they didn't have a king
[24:30] that was ruling uh uh uh that was ruling
[24:32] over them and so Gideon of course became
[24:36] one ended up being one of the judges
[24:38] that um that helped save Israel and you
[24:41] can read about it for the next two or
[24:43] three chapters but here's Gideon Gideon
[24:46] is presented to us here at this moment
[24:48] and where and what is Gideon doing he is
[24:52] hiding from the midianites he is hiding
[24:56] from from what uh because he's afraid as
[24:59] well he got to a point where he was just
[25:02] like everybody else amen whatever they
[25:03] were doing whatever we're just hiding
[25:06] we're trying to just uh
[25:08] because and not understanding the reason
[25:11] why he they got to the point where they
[25:13] got because later on we we we see here
[25:17] um if if you read in verse 13 it says
[25:20] and Gideon said unto him oh my Lord if
[25:24] the Lord be with us why then is all this
[25:28] befalling
[25:30] us I wonder if that's what we don't ask
[25:32] ourselves when things are not going
[25:34] right in our
[25:36] lives what is it that's happening in our
[25:38] home or is not happening in our home
[25:41] what is it that's happening in your life
[25:43] spiritually or not happening in your
[25:45] life spiritually and then when things
[25:48] start coming falling apart Lord why is
[25:50] this happening to
[25:52] us it's the same thing that Gideon was
[25:54] asking but the Lord At the beginning
[25:57] told told us clearly that the children
[25:59] of Israel had done evil in the sight of
[26:01] the
[26:02] Lord they were started worshiping other
[26:04] gods in other words putting other gods
[26:06] before them maybe it was an individual
[26:11] or a man or or or or or Idols or
[26:13] whatever it was maybe it was their
[26:15] businesses maybe it was money maybe it
[26:18] was their their education whatever it
[26:20] was something was an idol for in in
[26:23] their in their life and God said I will
[26:25] not share my glory with with any other
[26:28] Idol amen God is not going to share his
[26:31] glory with anything amen that you put
[26:33] before
[26:34] him you either serve God or you don't
[26:38] right am man just like Joshua stood up
[26:41] he said he said uh you're either serve
[26:44] the Lord or or but as for me in my house
[26:48] we will serve the Lord amen praise
[26:51] God and so and so Gideon is here and
[26:55] he's saiding oh my Lord if the Lord be
[26:56] with us why then all this befallen us
[27:00] and where be all his miracles which our
[27:02] fathers told told us of saying did not
[27:06] the Lord bring us up from Egypt so all
[27:08] he knew was everything that they had to
[27:11] the message that they had been
[27:14] told of what God did back then amen but
[27:18] you see you realized and we see it no
[27:21] matter how much you know the message or
[27:23] how many people have come into the
[27:24] message or know the word amen people
[27:26] backslide
[27:29] you you can have known this message 50
[27:31] 70 even met the prophet shook his hand
[27:34] that doesn't stop you from backsliding
[27:36] and and and and forsaking and forsaking
[27:38] the Lord but you remember the Lord never
[27:40] forsook you and you'll find them again
[27:43] where you left them
[27:46] amen it doesn't guarantee amen that that
[27:49] you had that you have to continually
[27:52] it's not just about one experience with
[27:53] God it's a continuous experience with
[27:56] God Amen amen and that's that's a that's
[27:59] a responsibility that's for you and I in
[28:02] this hour when the going gets tough amen
[28:05] you got to get
[28:07] tougher amen things are pressure is
[28:10] going to come on us life is going to
[28:12] happen but is that the time to quit and
[28:14] leave and stop going to church and and
[28:16] and and leaving the word no that's
[28:19] actually the time for you to get
[28:20] stronger your family depends on it your
[28:23] your your children depend on it amen
[28:25] your your your friends co-workers people
[28:28] are looking at your life and they see
[28:31] you as an example but you're a quitter
[28:34] they can't gain strength from
[28:36] you they're not going to get strength
[28:38] from you and then you're booh whooing in
[28:41] the corner why do people don't talk to
[28:43] me or like me or have any confidence in
[28:45] me because you're a
[28:47] quitter spiritual quitter and that's
[28:50] what Gideon had
[28:52] become Gideon amen but see the Lord had
[28:56] seen something gide cu the Lord doesn't
[28:58] see the way we see things cuz this is
[29:01] how this is how the Lord appeared to him
[29:02] he said the Lord is with thee thou
[29:04] Mighty Man of Valor and there was Gideon
[29:07] hiding threshing threshing there right
[29:10] next to the Wi
[29:13] press I hope they don't see me over here
[29:16] and here comes this man that appears
[29:18] before him and he says Thou Gideon you
[29:21] are a man of Valor can you imagine
[29:25] that you being scared and then and then
[29:28] somebody comes before you and says you
[29:30] know what you're not a scared person
[29:32] you're not a scaredy
[29:36] cat and then that's when Gideon starts
[29:38] asking he's like well Lord but he didn't
[29:41] know that it was the Lord talking to him
[29:42] at that
[29:43] moment amen let's continue reading he
[29:46] said did not the Lord bring us from
[29:47] Egypt but now the Lord hath forsaken us
[29:51] and deliver delivered us into the hands
[29:54] of the
[29:55] medit of course forgetting the reason
[29:58] why as many of us do
[30:02] sometimes and the Lord looked upon him
[30:05] and said go in this thy
[30:09] might now can you imagine you sitting
[30:12] there and you're and and you're doing
[30:13] what you're you know you're in your
[30:15] comfort zone you're doing your daily
[30:18] task don't every don't nobody get me out
[30:21] of my comfort zone I want to just do
[30:25] this and that's it right don't don't get
[30:29] me out of my comfort zone and and if you
[30:33] do people get upset when they get out of
[30:36] their comfort
[30:37] zone it's almost like when you sit in
[30:39] someone's seat at
[30:40] church look at their faces when they
[30:43] come
[30:46] in oh
[30:49] my I wonder if that's the get the face
[30:51] that Gideon
[30:52] had what is he talking about I'm a
[30:55] mighty man of Valor I'm strong
[30:59] man go in this thy might he said to go
[31:03] to do
[31:05] what I wonder if that's what if that's
[31:07] what Gideon Gideon is asking go to do
[31:10] what go in what Mike see that's what the
[31:12] thing is is that the Lord wants us to go
[31:15] and serve him Amen in what you have
[31:18] already you you don't need anything else
[31:21] you don't need amen go with what you
[31:23] have right now no but I got to wait
[31:26] until I get a better person and and I
[31:28] start going to church uh uh uh every
[31:31] single Sunday every single Wednesday no
[31:33] go with what you have
[31:35] now amen because with what you have now
[31:38] it will lead you Amen to go to church
[31:40] every Sunday and every Wednesday and and
[31:42] and read the word and study and meditate
[31:44] and pray and be the the the husband and
[31:47] the father and the mother and the and
[31:50] the wife that you're supposed to be go
[31:51] with what you have now the faith at what
[31:53] you have now God is capable to use that
[31:56] amen
[31:57] what did God tell Moses amen pick up
[32:00] that stick that you have in your hand
[32:02] and with that stick I'll do Miracles
[32:05] amen God wants to use your stick as I
[32:07] preached here a few months ago amen he
[32:10] wants to use what you have so he's
[32:12] telling Gideon he said go with thou go
[32:16] go in this thy might amen why because
[32:20] he's going to take care of the rest
[32:23] amen we do our part he'll do the rest
[32:26] amen amen praise the Lord and thou shalt
[32:30] save Israel what look what he's telling
[32:32] him Thou shalt save
[32:34] Israel from the hand of the
[32:37] midianites have not I sent thee praise
[32:40] the Lord Jesus amen and he said unto him
[32:43] oh my Lord wherewith All Shall I save
[32:45] Israel in other words with what am I
[32:46] going to save Israel with behold my
[32:49] family is poor in Manasseh and I am the
[32:52] least in my father's house so now he's
[32:54] making excuses just like Moses was was
[32:57] but you know what God loves it when when
[32:59] there's a person that doesn't really
[33:01] want to do what he wants to do what he
[33:03] wants him to
[33:04] do those are the ones he wants to
[33:08] use those are the ones that he's going
[33:11] to work miracles and wonders
[33:13] through amen the one that's that's
[33:15] clamoring to to to I'll just take a
[33:18] preacher as an example the one that's
[33:19] wanting to really just preach that's the
[33:22] one you need to be careful of am the one
[33:26] that really wants to get up and do
[33:28] something at church and just just re you
[33:31] be
[33:32] careful
[33:34] amen those are the ones that you have to
[33:36] be careful with because amen the person
[33:39] I don't I don't know who it's not it's
[33:42] preaching is not
[33:44] fun it's not the the the you know what
[33:47] the in in in in America the the most
[33:51] undervalued position in in America is a
[33:55] pastor according to to to the to the
[33:59] censuses and things that they've done is
[34:02] the most undervalued position or or I
[34:05] think I'm saying the right word or the
[34:07] the the most
[34:10] underappreciated is a pastor I don't
[34:13] know why anybody would even want want to
[34:15] be a pastor but if you're really God
[34:18] called amen you're going to be doing
[34:20] what God called you to
[34:22] do when you don't want to do it amen
[34:25] that's the one that God says all right
[34:28] that's what I
[34:29] want that's what I want because I know
[34:31] it won't be him amen dealing with the
[34:34] people it'll be me through him and he
[34:36] will allow me to deal with the people
[34:39] amen the way I want to do it you see God
[34:42] is all about getting the glory out of
[34:44] this amen that's what he's about he's
[34:48] not going to share his glory with
[34:49] anybody else amen and it's not about the
[34:52] man and it's not about about his glory
[34:55] we appreciate the man we appre
[34:56] appreciate what God has done amen but
[34:59] it's about God ultimately and he gets
[35:02] the
[35:03] glory praise the Lord
[35:05] Jesus
[35:07] amen I appreciate all the man you know
[35:10] that that I have I have sat under you
[35:12] know from the denominational
[35:16] Church from the Baptist Church that I
[35:18] was in even in the Jehovah's Witness
[35:21] even the Catholic
[35:22] church I appreciate the priests that
[35:25] that help that that that that helped me
[35:27] you know go through first communion and
[35:29] stick out my tongue to take the wafer
[35:31] and all of that it helped me with
[35:33] something with God you know I appreciate
[35:36] all of that but it was ultimately
[35:39] leading me to have a relationship with
[35:41] God Amen and not with the individual am
[35:46] amen it's ultimately about God praise
[35:49] the
[35:50] Lord and the and and so and he said unto
[35:54] him oh my Lord wherewith All Shall I
[35:56] save Israel behold my family's porn
[35:57] manasse verse 16 and the Lord said unto
[35:59] him surely I will be with thee and thou
[36:02] shalt Smite the minites as one as one
[36:05] man now let's let's read this quote here
[36:07] brother Brown says because I I've always
[36:10] as I was looking at this I couldn't help
[36:11] to think you know of of that mother
[36:14] Eagle that brother brandom talks about
[36:16] where she makes that Nest very
[36:19] comfortable for her eaglets for her eggs
[36:22] that are going to be born she makes sure
[36:26] that that when she makes that Nest that
[36:28] it's going to be very comfortable for
[36:31] them so it doesn't hurt them when
[36:34] they're tender and they're and they're
[36:36] small you see and with that same beak
[36:40] that she feeds them they start growing
[36:44] right they start growing and they start
[36:46] getting to a point where now wait a
[36:49] second these these kids are going to
[36:51] have to fly just like me
[36:54] too how I to get them out of this place
[36:58] Place almost like some of parents when
[37:00] we start thinking when our kids are
[37:01] turning
[37:02] 18 19 20 21 now I'm not going to kick my
[37:07] kids out but I'm just saying you know
[37:10] sometimes we we sometimes we we we think
[37:12] that that's the best for them and that's
[37:15] fine and that might be the best thing
[37:17] for them
[37:19] right but you see at some point our
[37:21] children amen they're going to have to
[37:23] take up wings and fly that's right and
[37:26] that's what God Amen wants to do with us
[37:28] at some point we got to take up Wings
[37:30] spiritually and
[37:32] fly amen it's it's we've had enough you
[37:35] know that same beak that that that the
[37:38] Lord has been feeding us with amen that
[37:40] same beak now starts destroying and
[37:44] taking up that rabbit skin that squirrel
[37:47] skin all that stuff everything amen and
[37:50] becomes and then the the the the eaglet
[37:52] they're oh my goodness what's going on
[37:55] it's all prickly now it's not soft and
[38:00] plush we're not falling asleep like we
[38:03] used
[38:04] to they're they're not rocking us to
[38:06] sleep
[38:07] anymore you know now they're they're
[38:10] they're tearing our hides now with the
[38:15] preaching well then that's what we need
[38:18] sometimes we you're a hides to be T me
[38:23] included but you see those eaglets amen
[38:26] they they have to have a reason to to to
[38:29] get out of
[38:30] there right you got to have a reason
[38:33] Amen to get out of your comfort zone
[38:36] God's going to make sure that you get
[38:38] out of your comfort zone some way or
[38:41] another because we're just too
[38:43] comfortable with
[38:45] life we're just too
[38:49] comfortable you know my wife and me we
[38:51] were talking about the other night we
[38:53] were saying you know she was saying you
[38:55] know I'd like to maybe change the the
[38:58] the the the ceiling fan in our in our
[39:00] room you know it's getting a little
[39:01] older and stuff I start thinking about
[39:03] some of those bathrooms we've been in
[39:04] Honduras and stuff and in in Brothers
[39:07] and Sisters houses and she started
[39:09] thinking about the same thing it's like
[39:11] you know the ceiling fan is just
[39:14] fine it's just
[39:18] fine when you start thinking you start
[39:21] seeing the other side of things you
[39:23] won't think all those things are so
[39:24] important that's right that's and you'll
[39:28] start thinking about H better ways to
[39:30] spend your
[39:31] money you won't think that all that
[39:33] stuff is it's nice it's fine if you can
[39:35] do it that's wonderful but the ceiling
[39:37] fan is just fine it still works it still
[39:41] rotates still gives
[39:45] air it's just that we wanted you know
[39:48] some something that kind of matched the
[39:50] the rest of the decor but it's not a
[39:53] need it was only a want right right and
[39:57] so God Amen wants us to start uh you
[40:03] know wants loves to get his children out
[40:05] of their comfort zones
[40:07] amen now I'm not saying that God doesn't
[40:10] want you to have a nice ceiling fan in
[40:11] your house especially if those blades
[40:14] are like this it's time to get another
[40:17] ceiling
[40:19] fan
[40:22] right but in the hour that we're living
[40:25] in Saints what are we looking at are we
[40:27] looking up or we keep looking
[40:29] horizontally at everything around us and
[40:32] see what we can obtain in this world and
[40:34] what we get am man because none of that
[40:35] you're taking with you none of that that
[40:38] you're you're going to Ive I've never
[40:40] seen a U-Haul truck behind the
[40:43] hearse none of it you're taking with us
[40:46] only the things that you do for God Amen
[40:50] is what's going ahead that's right and
[40:52] what will be presented before him now
[40:54] brother Brandon would say it like this
[40:56] this is what he would say he says so you
[40:58] know what happens the old mother comes
[41:00] into that nest and she takes that same
[41:03] beak that that she doed it all up with
[41:07] and pulls every bit of that sheep skin
[41:10] out every bit of that rabbit fur out and
[41:12] throws the thing out of the nest oh it's
[41:16] it's she she and she does it it's it's
[41:20] doesn't it doesn't look
[41:21] pretty she does it uh in a rough way
[41:26] right right she makes the nest so
[41:29] miserable till they can't even sit down
[41:33] those little
[41:35] eaglets
[41:37] right I just wonder how comfortable we
[41:40] are you know in this l in the in leoa
[41:43] that we're living
[41:44] in when God has given us and he he's
[41:48] just tearing tearing all that fur out
[41:51] you know he's and we're still trying to
[41:54] just kind of put the fur back on right
[41:56] no I want it dur and you're stapling it
[41:59] together and everything I like my
[42:02] comfort Z I love my Comforts I love Leo
[42:07] DEA me included we love it brother you
[42:12] know God knows how to make you willing
[42:14] to do things brother brandham
[42:17] said God knows how to make you willing
[42:20] to do things that's happened to the many
[42:23] of you family certainly it is he just
[42:26] pulls all that soft pad out so you walk
[42:28] on
[42:30] Thorns my every time he sits down it's a
[42:34] it's it's on a thorn he jumps up he
[42:37] becomes discouraged after a while that
[42:39] that little eaglet and I think if there
[42:41] was ever time that the Pentecostal
[42:43] Church ought to be discouraged is now he
[42:46] continues to say we've denominated
[42:49] ourselves now he's talking to the
[42:51] Pentecostal Church in that day amen and
[42:54] to the denominations of that day but you
[42:57] see we sometimes we make our own
[42:59] denominations even in one
[43:03] church we make our own little clicks and
[43:05] our own little ideas and and then
[43:08] brother and sister don't see it that way
[43:10] I don't know if I'm going to go shake
[43:13] their hand or or even say
[43:16] hello we make our own ideas and we make
[43:19] our own judgments about people because
[43:22] maybe of somebody or some family member
[43:24] told you about them or or or or or
[43:27] something but you see that's our own
[43:30] little denominations within our own
[43:34] church but God is doing everything he
[43:36] can to pull all that out Saints it's
[43:39] time to go
[43:40] home it's time to go home for us to be
[43:43] Pitter pattering and and having feelings
[43:46] and stuff against each
[43:48] other it's not time for that it's time
[43:50] for us to actually draw closer to each
[43:52] other especially as the time of the as
[43:55] the is coming as soon at hand praise God
[43:59] we've denominated ourselves built great
[44:01] barriers of lines brother Brown
[44:03] continues to say one's assemblies the
[44:05] other one's a Oneness the other one is
[44:08] this I'm a brother Bob I'm I'm I'm a
[44:11] brother Aaron I'm a brother Wade I'm a
[44:14] brother Dale I'm a
[44:16] amen amen I'm of
[44:18] God praise the Lord and I'm I'm I'm with
[44:21] any brother that speaks the word of the
[44:23] Lord behind that
[44:25] pulpit amen well if brother so and so is
[44:28] not doing I don't think it's I don't
[44:30] think it's it it's too
[44:33] valid is it the word of the Lord coming
[44:35] out of his
[44:37] lips or is he up there just playing
[44:41] games praise
[44:44] God the other is this and that and the
[44:46] other one and and then we just built
[44:48] such lines and barriers Till There is a
[44:50] stick stick here and a stick stick there
[44:54] what's the matter God fixing to take us
[44:57] out of it he
[44:58] says amen praise the Lord that's exactly
[45:01] what it is them little old Eagles get
[45:03] tired setting down on them Thorns amen
[45:06] eventually they got to get up and fly
[45:08] and that's what God wants to do amen
[45:10] when we're in our comfort zones he wants
[45:12] us Amen to just fly for ourselves
[45:15] instead of just crying go and
[45:17] speak praise the Lord that's and that's
[45:20] what God was trying to do with Gideon
[45:22] amen he was in a rut he was in a in in a
[45:25] in a in a in his comfort zone and God
[45:27] knew that that he had that he had
[45:29] potential Amen to do something great for
[45:33] him and so he started calling directly
[45:36] telling calling the things that they
[45:37] were not as though they
[45:40] were telling him that he was
[45:42] mighty when he was not displaying that
[45:47] and that's how sometimes you know when
[45:48] we're dealing with our children you know
[45:50] I'm getting back to the parenting now
[45:53] when we're dealing with our children
[45:54] amen we so we can't deal with with our
[45:56] children amen the same way right you
[45:59] know some some some of some maybe one of
[46:01] our CH our child is is is is is a
[46:04] different way and needs to be talked to
[46:07] a different way you
[46:08] see you know or or or or or dealt with a
[46:12] certain way because you know that that's
[46:13] what's going to work you see but if you
[46:17] have a cookie cutter approach and you
[46:19] and and you're like why did this one go
[46:22] this way or why heyen maybe you didn't
[46:26] come to the heart of that child or dealt
[46:29] with that child in in his strength or in
[46:32] what
[46:34] he's you see what I'm trying to
[46:36] say but sometimes we have it as a cookie
[46:38] cutter but that's not how God dealt with
[46:41] Gideon God dealt with Gideon you know he
[46:43] could have he could have dealt with him
[46:44] the way he dealt with Moses at the
[46:47] burning bush but that's not how he
[46:49] appeared to
[46:50] Gideon he knew that that was not the way
[46:53] that was going to work and was going to
[46:54] get Gideon's
[46:56] reaction amen so he dealt with Gideon
[46:59] and telling him you know you're you're
[47:01] you're
[47:03] strong you know sometimes our our
[47:05] children amen when they're when they're
[47:06] like just falling flat on their face and
[47:09] they're doing dumb stuff you know what
[47:12] you're you're
[47:17] [Laughter]
[47:21] smart
[47:23] you're you you're a very bright person
[47:28] person just don't do that
[47:35] again but that's how God dealt with the
[47:37] idian you
[47:40] see amen praise
[47:42] God now the the thing is is that we
[47:45] can't grow amen if if we're not
[47:48] challenged if we're not challenged or
[47:50] stretched in any way we're not going to
[47:52] be able to
[47:53] grow amen the Christian life is about
[47:57] growth right therefore we have to be
[47:59] challenged by something in life even
[48:02] Paul amen had a challenge in his life
[48:05] that he asked God multiple times take it
[48:07] out of me and God said no my grace is
[48:11] sufficient he didn't want that out of
[48:13] his life not because God didn't care for
[48:15] him or not because God was not concerned
[48:17] about that challenge that he had amen
[48:19] but it was because that what was keeping
[48:21] him
[48:22] humble it was keeping him in prayer it
[48:25] was keeping him in humility and meekness
[48:27] and and doing what he wanted him because
[48:30] ultimately who gets the glory is God
[48:33] praise the Lord Jesus amen so we can't
[48:36] we can't grow if we're not if we're not
[48:38] challenged in life amen if we're not if
[48:40] we're not going beyond our comfort zones
[48:43] and this is where Gideon was at amen
[48:45] this is what God was trying to do with
[48:47] Gideon amen was trying to get him out of
[48:49] his comfort zones because why God
[48:51] knowing the beginning from the end he
[48:52] knew what at what Gideon was going to do
[48:55] he had had to get him out of that wine
[48:57] press amen get him out of that Comfort
[48:59] Zone in order to get him to do what he
[49:01] wanted him to do praise God you know God
[49:05] has a plan for each and every one of
[49:08] us and sometimes we Buck at that we Buck
[49:12] at it and and and we're like I I don't
[49:15] know listen me
[49:18] included I I no I don't I don't I don't
[49:21] want that in my
[49:23] life well God If he if he loves you and
[49:26] I know he
[49:27] does he's a gentleman and he's not going
[49:30] to force you to do anything he's going
[49:33] to wait until you willingly want to walk
[49:35] in his word until you willingly want to
[49:38] walk and what is his word his
[49:40] will amen when you willingly want to
[49:43] walk in his will amen then God is going
[49:45] to be able to use you to do the Wonders
[49:49] that he wants to do through your life
[49:51] that's right listen I I I was really
[49:54] blessed by Sister Melissa's test
[49:55] testimony on Sunday how many heard his
[49:58] her
[49:59] testimony you know when sister Melissa
[50:01] she she
[50:03] she she didn't realize amen the impact
[50:07] that she was going to have by making the
[50:09] decision that she
[50:11] made about not wearing the the the pants
[50:14] scrubs at at at at at at at church at at
[50:17] the hospital it was she was wearing them
[50:19] the whole time but but then finally
[50:21] something happened said you know what I
[50:23] want to be a witness for real amen and
[50:26] when she did that things
[50:29] changed now everybody was like wait a
[50:31] second she has bravery enough to do that
[50:34] and other women started coming up to her
[50:36] asking her what can how can I do that
[50:39] now she's getting ready to talk to 7
[50:41] what 77,000
[50:43] people they in the in the in the whole
[50:46] uh medical system there about how the
[50:51] the length of it needs to be and and and
[50:53] all of that that's amen that's God right
[50:56] there but It ultimately took her to make
[50:58] that decision right God didn't force her
[51:01] to make that decision something amen
[51:03] that she she got a re a revelation of
[51:06] some sort and Revelation amen causes you
[51:09] to see things
[51:10] differently amen it causes you to to act
[51:14] upon things in a different way when
[51:17] something truly has been revealed to you
[51:19] that's amen you see things in a
[51:22] different
[51:22] way why isn't others seeing them that
[51:25] ways because God revealed it to you amen
[51:27] right thank God for God's
[51:29] revelation thank God for his word has
[51:31] being revealed to you why why are people
[51:33] so excited why are those people so
[51:35] excited about God's word amen it's
[51:37] because they the word has been revealed
[51:39] to
[51:41] them and that's why they're they that's
[51:43] why they they can't get enough of
[51:46] it because they've seen something in
[51:49] God's word
[51:52] amen amen when when the Lord takes you
[51:55] out out of your comfort zone amen you
[51:58] see the reality that's ahead of you in a
[52:00] different way and that's what happened
[52:02] to Gideon because because look what look
[52:07] look what happened to Gideon well we'll
[52:08] really here in a moment because I want
[52:10] you to notice that here in in this same
[52:14] chapter Gideon um he almost had like a
[52:17] it it was I Won't Say I'm not saying
[52:19] it's the new birth but it's almost like
[52:21] a type kind of happened there because
[52:24] here in in judges 6 verse verse 19 it
[52:27] says here and Gideon went in and made
[52:30] ready a kid and unleavened cakes of an
[52:33] EPA of flour the flesh he put in a
[52:35] basket and he put the broth in a pot and
[52:38] brought it out unto him under the Oak
[52:40] and presented it he presented it before
[52:43] this this this man that appeared to him
[52:46] and the angel of God said unto him take
[52:48] the Flesh and the unleavened cakes and
[52:50] lay them Upon This Rock in other words
[52:53] upon an altar amen and pour out the
[52:56] broth and he did so and look what the
[52:59] what the angel of the Lord did and the
[53:01] angel of the Lord put forth the end of
[53:02] the staff that was in his hand and
[53:04] touched the Flesh and the UNL cakes and
[53:06] There Rose up fire out of the Rock and
[53:09] consumed the Flesh and done leaven cakes
[53:13] then the angel of the Lord departed out
[53:15] of his sight amen it was almost how is
[53:18] it that God wants us to present our
[53:20] bodies as living sacrifices amen and it
[53:24] wasn't until until Gideon amen got to
[53:27] this point amen that he's he's now
[53:29] obeying what this man is telling him to
[53:32] do to present this sacrifice to do this
[53:35] and when he did it the right way when he
[53:37] got born
[53:39] [Laughter]
[53:40] again then God could go in there and
[53:43] sacrifice or or consume it right when
[53:46] you're born again amen you see things
[53:48] differently after that you're not going
[53:51] to see the same thresh and frol the same
[53:53] way again you see see the plan of God
[53:56] differently now you see that God wants
[53:58] to use you in a great
[54:01] way and you see what the potential of of
[54:04] of of your life is is in the word I hope
[54:07] you're understanding what I'm trying to
[54:09] say after this experience that Gideon
[54:12] had right here amen he saw his life
[54:14] different
[54:15] now because now he's telling me I'm a
[54:17] strong man I'm I'm a mighty man of Valor
[54:20] I'm I'm this that and the other I didn't
[54:22] believe him at the moment but now I I
[54:24] present this sacrifice before him he
[54:26] consumes it
[54:28] who fire does
[54:31] something it makes changes for sure
[54:34] praise God in other words Gideon became
[54:38] convinced and when you're convinced
[54:40] you're concerned amen praise the
[54:44] Lord amen that's that's really how A
[54:47] true a you know how a Christian's life
[54:50] should be praise God you should be
[54:53] convinced and concerned brother says it
[54:55] like this now now this thing we have to
[54:57] do if we can believe it and be concerned
[55:00] about it watch if we can believe it and
[55:03] be concerned about it first we've got to
[55:05] be convinced that it is God then we're
[55:09] when we're convinced then we are
[55:12] concerned amen amen if you're not
[55:15] convinced about something you're not
[55:17] going to act upon it
[55:20] right if I'm not convinced amen that
[55:24] that that we need to be in church I'm
[55:27] not going to be in church it's just as
[55:30] simple as
[55:33] that right if I'm not
[55:35] convinced about you know anything in
[55:38] anything in life if that's not become a
[55:41] reality to me or a revelation to me then
[55:43] I'm not going to act upon it amen I'm
[55:46] not going to to do anything about it but
[55:50] it wasn't so with Gideon Gideon was
[55:52] convinced now that God had something
[55:55] amen for him I hope that we're convinced
[55:58] that God has a plan for
[56:00] you you know you might be going through
[56:02] your daily life and and and and going
[56:05] through school and going you know and
[56:08] and not thinking I'm wondering what I'm
[56:09] going to do later on in life but you you
[56:11] know go God already saw that before the
[56:13] foundation of the
[56:16] world he he knows he's waiting you for
[56:19] for you to come and and and and make the
[56:21] decision and make the choice amen that
[56:24] he he knows you'll you'll come to praise
[56:28] God but you have to come to that your
[56:30] own self just as Gideon had to come to
[56:32] it you see the Lord was there telling
[56:35] him you're a mighty man of Valor you're
[56:37] this that and the other but Gideon had
[56:39] to con he had to be convinced of that
[56:41] himself amen and and that's what the new
[56:44] birth does in our lives it convinces us
[56:47] amen that the word is
[56:49] true all the word is
[56:51] true amen and that and that not just the
[56:55] part about me being born again but now I
[56:57] see the whole the whole uh the the whole
[57:00] picture now has become more clear you
[57:03] may not understand everything in detail
[57:05] but you see the
[57:07] essence of things it's one thing that
[57:10] brother brother few years ago when
[57:12] brother Wade and me were talking you
[57:14] know and we were we were we were uh when
[57:17] we were started coming uh here to the
[57:20] church and you know I've been coming to
[57:22] the m a message church since 2000 all
[57:25] that's when I came into the message and
[57:27] and and and but but but then I started
[57:29] seeing things in a in a different way
[57:32] and it was one of the things that he
[57:33] mentioned to me was that you now get the
[57:36] essence of the message you see and
[57:39] that's important amen you get the
[57:41] essence of the message and that's the
[57:42] reason why brother Brandon could say if
[57:44] you don't see Christ from Genesis to
[57:46] Revelation just read over again because
[57:49] it's there it's all about Christ and
[57:53] what is it what did Paul say man Christ
[57:55] in you the hope of glory
[57:58] amen that's what that's what this this
[58:00] thing is all about it's not about rules
[58:02] and regulations and dos and don'ts
[58:05] that's what the world wants to make it
[58:07] that's what the nominal World wants to
[58:08] make it amen but it's it's about Christ
[58:11] Living Through you wanting to do great
[58:14] things through your
[58:17] life
[58:19] amen amen and it's not just about and I
[58:22] know I say these things all the time but
[58:24] it's not sometimes we think that it's
[58:26] great things like I'm going to go to the
[58:28] cemetery up here in Lula next and I'm
[58:30] going to just raise all the dead that
[58:32] are there that's not what God called you
[58:34] to
[58:37] do God didn't call you to go uh and and
[58:41] and I'm going to just heal all the sick
[58:43] at the at the the hospital there in
[58:45] Gainesville that's not what God called
[58:46] you to do maybe he did and I can't I I
[58:50] can't I couldn't argue with that but for
[58:53] the majority of us I don't think God has
[58:55] called us to do that but I see some
[58:57] parents here I see some some families
[59:01] here I see some some brothers and
[59:03] sisters here that maybe God called you
[59:07] as I mentioned last time you know to
[59:09] fold your your husband's socks in a uh
[59:13] in a better
[59:14] attitude you know or you know or or or
[59:19] tell your wife I love you in a not in a
[59:22] way that you feel that you have to do
[59:24] that right but in a way that you really
[59:27] love
[59:28] her I mean she is beyond the Shadow of
[59:31] Doubt she knows that you love
[59:33] her that's what I'm talking about that's
[59:36] what a new birth experience will make
[59:38] you do it'll make you be
[59:41] genuine which is something we're lacking
[59:43] in this
[59:45] nowadays people are not genuine
[59:48] anymore and when you do see a genuine
[59:50] someone that's genuine you notice it
[59:53] because you notice so much much fakery
[59:55] around you it's become a a life of
[59:58] fakery social media fakery AI fakery all
[1:00:03] kinds of fakery but when you see
[1:00:05] something true and genuine it stands
[1:00:08] out because that's what the people are
[1:00:10] looking
[1:00:11] for especially if when it's something
[1:00:14] genuine that's that and that person has
[1:00:16] a new birth you know that that's Christ
[1:00:20] showing that genuiness in their life God
[1:00:22] help us to be more like that I I want be
[1:00:24] more like
[1:00:26] that it's hard you know circumstances
[1:00:29] and situations and things you know you
[1:00:32] you want to it's so easy to get in your
[1:00:34] own bubble and and I want to be in my
[1:00:36] own Island and that's it and and it it's
[1:00:39] but God wants us out of our comfort
[1:00:41] zones because God has great things for
[1:00:44] us to do amen what is the I'm finishing
[1:00:47] up here what is the word convince mean
[1:00:49] and here's what it means is completely
[1:00:51] certain about
[1:00:53] something brother Brandon preached the
[1:00:55] message called convinced and then
[1:00:57] concerned amen and this is what he was
[1:00:59] talking about completely certain about
[1:01:01] something
[1:01:03] amen praise the Lord you sisters who
[1:01:05] have had children you know that you had
[1:01:07] those
[1:01:08] children I mean you're convinced that
[1:01:11] you had
[1:01:12] them I could probably ask you the
[1:01:14] multiple reasons why you're
[1:01:18] convinced and you would tell me why you
[1:01:21] felt the
[1:01:22] pain you you you you you you see them
[1:01:25] before you amen you know all about it
[1:01:29] you're convinced amen praise God it also
[1:01:33] means firm in one's belief firm in one's
[1:01:36] belief with regard to a particular cause
[1:01:39] or
[1:01:40] issue and you know you can actually look
[1:01:42] at that as a
[1:01:44] revelation you know when I saw when I
[1:01:46] saw the uh uh one God
[1:01:50] Amen you can't take that coming from a
[1:01:53] nominal world right I know some of us
[1:01:55] didn't do didn't come from that but
[1:01:56] coming from a nominal world and when you
[1:01:58] see one God that stands out big time
[1:02:02] nobody can take that away from
[1:02:05] me praise God I can have my my most down
[1:02:09] day and and and and maybe fail God Amen
[1:02:13] but you can't take that out of me that's
[1:02:16] right brother and his name is the Lord
[1:02:18] Jesus Christ that's that's a revelation
[1:02:21] that just stands firm amen right praise
[1:02:24] the Lord amen you're
[1:02:26] convinced and then what is the part
[1:02:28] about being concerned look what the word
[1:02:30] concerned means to become involved with
[1:02:32] something or worried about something now
[1:02:36] not worried that you are like biting
[1:02:37] your nails worried because that actually
[1:02:39] makes you sick right right right and it
[1:02:43] makes your finger fingers sting a
[1:02:46] bit but but you're concerned I mean
[1:02:49] you're you're you want to be part of
[1:02:51] that you
[1:02:52] see right when I when I when I was
[1:02:55] revealed that water baptism in Lord
[1:02:57] Jesus Christ was the right way to be
[1:02:59] baptized I went immediately and got to
[1:03:01] get go get
[1:03:02] baptized right that is the concerned
[1:03:05] part right you do something about it
[1:03:09] most of us or a lot of us we're
[1:03:11] convinced that things are true we just
[1:03:12] don't do anything about it righten we're
[1:03:15] not concerned enough to do anything
[1:03:17] about about that that we know is
[1:03:20] true so we just kind of sit
[1:03:23] idle in our comfort
[1:03:26] zones and we just kind of let life
[1:03:28] happen to
[1:03:29] us and whatever happens
[1:03:32] and not knowing that you have a say in
[1:03:36] things because God has a plan for
[1:03:40] you
[1:03:43] right God wants to use you in a mighty
[1:03:47] way praise the Lord amen and we don't
[1:03:50] need to be
[1:03:52] idle praise God
[1:03:55] so that's what concern means to become
[1:03:57] involved with something or worried about
[1:04:00] something amen and so when Gideon became
[1:04:03] con convinced and concerned here's some
[1:04:06] of the things that that he was able to
[1:04:08] do amen by the Lord's command he
[1:04:11] destroyed baal's Altar and cut down the
[1:04:13] Grove next to it the whole time that he
[1:04:17] was
[1:04:18] there in his comfort zone the his dad
[1:04:22] had an altar to bail
[1:04:24] yeah and it was sitting there he wasn't
[1:04:27] doing anything about it when he was
[1:04:30] convinced or got the new birth I'm not
[1:04:33] saying that he did I'm just saying it
[1:04:35] was a type he had an experience with God
[1:04:37] let me just say it that way he got
[1:04:40] convinced and concerned and the Lord
[1:04:42] said go tear that that that that altar
[1:04:44] down raise one up for me that's exactly
[1:04:47] what he did amen why he
[1:04:50] knew what God what God's word said amen
[1:04:54] right and when you know what God's word
[1:04:56] says it puts you to action when you're
[1:04:58] convinced about God's word it puts you
[1:05:00] to action Gideon was convinced and he
[1:05:04] went and tore down that Altar and the
[1:05:06] man of the city the next day they got up
[1:05:09] and they said what in the world happened
[1:05:16] here as what's all this what's all
[1:05:21] this and they got upset that their altar
[1:05:25] was destroyed that's right but Gideon
[1:05:28] didn't
[1:05:29] care he was doing the Lord's work amen
[1:05:33] that's what happens when you're
[1:05:34] convinced and you're concerned you
[1:05:37] continue P pushing forward amen praise
[1:05:40] God Amen another thing that he did is
[1:05:43] Gideon managed to build a very small
[1:05:45] army of
[1:05:47] 300 it started I think at as 30,000 or
[1:05:51] something like that but God said no
[1:05:53] that's too many to fight the
[1:05:55] medit and and the medit had like over
[1:05:58] 200 something
[1:05:59] thousand but God said now compare 30,000
[1:06:04] to 200,000 that's still a big gap
[1:06:08] there but God said that's still too
[1:06:10] many so we know the story and he gets it
[1:06:13] down all the way down to 300 men I can
[1:06:16] imagine you know with the people the the
[1:06:18] guys that were with Gideon are like I
[1:06:21] know Gideon Gideon I know the Lord spoke
[1:06:23] through you but I know deep down in
[1:06:25] there they're probably thinking I don't
[1:06:27] 300 man against
[1:06:30] 200,000 I'd be scared too and maybe
[1:06:32] Gideon was probably thinking Lord is
[1:06:35] this going to work but he was called
[1:06:36] right amen he was called from the
[1:06:39] beginning and the Lord told him and said
[1:06:40] you're going to save Israel right you're
[1:06:43] going to do it and go with with that
[1:06:45] your might amen right and of course he
[1:06:49] defeats the midianites and you can read
[1:06:52] about it in the chat we don't have time
[1:06:53] to do that but Gideon also defeats the
[1:06:55] the their kings Zeba and
[1:06:59] Zuna not just defeats the midianites but
[1:07:01] also their
[1:07:02] kings amen and completely saves Israel
[1:07:06] right amen when you're convinced and
[1:07:09] concerned when you're out of your
[1:07:10] comfort zone then God can use you amen
[1:07:14] when he was out of his comfort zone then
[1:07:16] God could use them amen praise God so
[1:07:19] that's my whole thought amen for tonight
[1:07:22] amen amen am am am I too comfortable in
[1:07:27] life maybe God has not have not too many
[1:07:30] too many trials are happening in my life
[1:07:32] praise the Lord no you should be worried
[1:07:35] about
[1:07:38] that you should be
[1:07:41] worried amen CU God loves to test his
[1:07:45] children not because they know that not
[1:07:48] because he loves to just test them it's
[1:07:51] because he wants you to realize where
[1:07:53] you're standing
[1:07:55] in the position that you're at so that
[1:07:58] you can move out of that you see God
[1:08:01] came to Gideon Amen in the position
[1:08:04] where he was at he was there in the
[1:08:06] threshing floor minding his own business
[1:08:08] and in his comfort zone he came in there
[1:08:12] amen and took him out of his comfort
[1:08:13] zone right in a in a very in a very uh
[1:08:18] miraculous way and then after that what
[1:08:21] happens when you're convinced and
[1:08:22] concerned you're focused right to move
[1:08:24] forward with your goal right nothing
[1:08:28] else amen distracts you anymore things
[1:08:30] can happen birds will fly over your head
[1:08:33] and distractions will be there but
[1:08:34] you're focused on the goal of the mark
[1:08:38] of the high calling as Paul said
[1:08:40] amen amen we got to get out of here
[1:08:43] Saints I'm tired of this pest
[1:08:46] house it's getting fat and I got to lose
[1:08:50] weight since November I just went off
[1:08:52] the deepend and
[1:08:54] I got to get back to my what I need to
[1:08:56] do and but man sour gummy worms are so
[1:09:01] good I just had a whole bag of sour
[1:09:04] gummy bears last
[1:09:05] night anyways I want to P I want to if
[1:09:08] the brothers could help me pull this up
[1:09:10] for just a moment and with this we're
[1:09:11] going to finish pull something up here
[1:09:14] real
[1:09:18] quick you excuse
[1:09:21] me when I pull this up I know my
[1:09:25] my wife and my daughters they'll
[1:09:29] know they'll know what uh what this
[1:09:33] is my wife is over there like what is he
[1:09:36] going to do
[1:09:38] now what is he going to
[1:09:45] show can y'all see
[1:09:50] that now they
[1:09:52] know now I know
[1:09:54] know the reason why I'm showing this is
[1:09:57] because there's a man in brazzleton
[1:10:00] Georgia he's he's a black guy that he
[1:10:04] he's a jogger he's he's fit and you know
[1:10:07] and he looks just like this now I
[1:10:11] literally typed this in with
[1:10:14] AI I I I I put in an AI I put please
[1:10:18] make me a picture with a a guy with a
[1:10:20] doag on headphones sunglasses and punch
[1:10:23] in the air and that's what it came out
[1:10:26] and it was pretty
[1:10:28] close now the
[1:10:31] guy when he's jogging he's always always
[1:10:33] jogs and he's always he always walking
[1:10:36] really fast this is what he's doing the
[1:10:38] whole
[1:10:47] time and he's got his headphones on and
[1:10:49] he's
[1:10:52] just
[1:10:55] Non-Stop and every time I drive by I I I
[1:10:58] come I go home from work man that made
[1:11:00] me
[1:11:02] [Laughter]
[1:11:04] tired huh I know I need to do
[1:11:09] that this is what he's
[1:11:11] doing the whole time and he looks
[1:11:16] ridiculous but he don't
[1:11:19] care he is focused and it's always
[1:11:22] between five between 5:30 p.m. to 7:00
[1:11:25] p.m. it's always between those times in
[1:11:28] brazzleton at that time uh there's a lot
[1:11:30] of traffic there on 211 as some of you
[1:11:32] all may know a lot of traffic he don't
[1:11:37] care he's focused on his goal crossing
[1:11:40] the
[1:11:42] street still going at
[1:11:45] it and I don't know how long he does it
[1:11:47] but every time I look at it I'm like you
[1:11:49] know what there's a sermon in
[1:11:52] that
[1:11:55] you know he's he's pressing on the mark
[1:11:56] of the high calling for his for whatever
[1:11:59] he's trying to achieve now he doesn't
[1:12:01] look quite as as buff as as this guy you
[1:12:04] know these AI images came out he's he's
[1:12:07] a thinner guy but he is he's focused I
[1:12:10] think that's
[1:12:12] it he's a focused guy but you know
[1:12:16] what when you're focused and you're
[1:12:18] convinced about something you're going
[1:12:20] to do it no matter what anybody else
[1:12:23] says
[1:12:24] you're going to achieve what what God
[1:12:27] called you to do no matter what anybody
[1:12:29] else says you know the whole world can
[1:12:32] be you know zooming around you and
[1:12:35] they're doing their own things they're
[1:12:37] they're driving their vehicles and
[1:12:40] you're out there but you're focused on
[1:12:42] what God called you to do so look as
[1:12:44] they say stay in your
[1:12:46] lane man stay in your lane I don't want
[1:12:49] to sound like I'm I'm talking about you
