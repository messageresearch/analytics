of new mexico right up by the colorado well pretty close to the colorado border but uh i want to mention that uh i really appreciate the opportunity of being here uh to be with you all let's uh go in our scriptures before i let you all sit down and let's go to malachi 4 the first chapter familiar scripture everybody uses malachi 4 and 5 the 5th chapter but i want to read a little bit on the first chapter because we realize that we're coming to this hour that we're living in and i want to talk a little bit about it malachi 4 the first chapter for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up saith the lord of hosts that it shall leave neither root nor branch amen let's go before the lord in prayer our dear and precious lord and heavenly father we come before you lord god first of all lord jesus i know lord god i'm i'm insufficient lord god after listening to the services that have been coming out of here lord god i don't even think i'm a preacher lord god but i know lord jesus that if i can yield myself lord god my body my soul my lips my body everything about me to you lord jesus you can speak to us lord god you can speak to me and the people lord god and i pray oh lord jesus that you helped me to in every way lord god yield my body yield myself to you lord god and let your word come forth for your people or god because we want to be edified we want to get ready for your coming lord god we want to know more about you lord jesus so we pray o lord god that you just bless us all as we come hungry and thirsting to hear from you in jesus christ's name amen amen i'm going to be reading a lot of scriptures so you can be seated and uh we we know that we honor the word as we uh we do read the word standing to our feet but because i'm we'll be reading a lot of scriptures we'll uh we'll go on you know i had a little phrase i told the the guys yesterday when i was fellowshipping at brother bob's uh that uh you know i'm i was telling him you know i work in a nuclear laboratory i says but i'm just an old farmer that grew up up there just digging you know pounding in posts and raising cattle and and feeding pigs and feeding chickens and stuff like that and and uh and i said when i got a job over there i just faked it till i made it yeah and you know what i'm already i'm already getting to retirement you know i'm already getting to retirement but fortunately they put me to tear apart things and not put things together so i'm not putting together anything that's real serious but nevertheless faking it till you make it and then my wife went and got a job at the same place and she's working other things and i said well honey you gotta fake it till you make it she says you can't fake it till you make it here you got to know what you're doing because you can lose your fingers so i said well okay we'll try something else well in this case as we come before god we can't fake it till we make it we just got to yield ourselves so we realized that that's right amen my title of my my message that i want to talk about is it's called red sky at morning and uh their scriptures the scripture is in uh matthew the 16th chapter the 14th verse and i think i was asking brother joseph to keep up with me on the scripture reading at least for the first two pages amen and let's go there real quick okay and i said yes see i i have a system here that i use for scriptures i use ribbons uh numbered ribbons that push me to the scripture quickly matthew 16 and 1 through 4 and it says uh it says the pharisees also and the sadducees came and tempted tempting tempting desiring him that he would show them a sign from heaven and he answered and said unto them when it is evening ye say it will be fair weather for the sky is red and in the morning it it it will be foul weather today for the sky is red and lowering o ye hypocrites you can discern the face of the skies but ye cannot discern the the signs of the time a wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign therefore shall no sign be given him but the sign of the prophet jonas okay now we realize that red sky at morning and the way he explained it is that if it's a red sky in the morning there's going to be bad weather but there's going to be foul weather and he goes on to speak in luke about the same kind of thing but he refers to it a little different in in luke 12 uh 2012 uh 54 and 56 uh so you see he's he's telling you that in in the scriptures here that as the the the weather can be the weather can at least in jerusalem the weather can be uh uh uh uh discerned amen let's go over to uh luke 12 54 and 56 i mean uh yeah 54 and 56. it says let me go to 54. it says and he and he said also to the people when you see the clouds rise out of the west straightway ye say there cometh a shower and so it is and when you see when you see the south wind blow you say there shall be heat and and it cometh to pass you hypocrites you can discern the face of the skies and the air and of the earth but how but now is it that how is it that that ye do not discern the signs of the time now i want to talk a little bit about the signs of the time when we talk about the signs of the time we look and we know that a lot of things that the brother branham explained are coming to pass we know that the the the cars that drive themselves it's on the horizon already they they're testing like cars like the tesla the all-electric vehicles they have a uh even my new honda that i got has a steering set up that i can press a button and it'll keep me on the road but it keeps asking me to keep my hands on the steering yeah so i don't have to turn it i just have to hold it and it'll turn itself and it'll pretty well keeps to lane debbie doesn't like it that much but but you know uh uh if i'm getting sleepy no i better not but nevertheless nevertheless uh uh it's there they're putting it not just in electric vehicles they're putting it in gasoline vehicles and that's not all i noticed the other day when a car was pulling out ahead of me a light went on that said break break break break if i wouldn't have braked i think it would have break for me but i don't know i didn't read the manual but nevertheless uh uh it probably will break for me but uh and it probably would have shocked me pretty good but nevertheless the the the the signs of the time are coming to pass and you start to wonder where are we living at what what day are we living in what signs are there where is the lord leading us to what kind of things should we be looking for in our day and hour how should we be dedicating our lives wholeheartedly to the truth that's been presented to us how should we be living for jesus the way we should how should we be uh you know you could say turning off the television and and getting into your bible and praying and seeking god and looking for a better relationship with him because as the signs of the time are happening you start to see that hey jerusalem's in the middle of a battle out there and you don't know if they're going to be if they're already crying out to god if they're already saying we need a manifestation of your spirit and god says i'm going to turn my heart my i'm going to turn my view towards jerusalem one day and the prophet will show up over there and the gentile age will be over and the bride goes on the rapture the resurrection of the we we know the signs of the time we know the bible where we're living looking at the scriptures we're seeing through the message of the hour the clarity that where we're living at what kind of lives should we be living in this day and age and it and the so we start to see the signs of the time now we look at uh at uh at saint john 4 25 and 26 and there there i'm just going to paraphrase it says yeah i know i know the the messiah cometh which i'll show us now you'll notice that uh this is the the story of the woman at the well right and you'll notice that the story of the woman well god was god somehow before he even came to the well himself well itself he already had showed this lady something so there's people out there that god will show something before they even get the chance to meet up with the fulfillment of it for example she says i know that the messiah cometh which which is called the christ he is which is called the christ he is which will okay lucy he's coming and will tell us all things so we're starting to see that even though we got a red sky in the morning judgment is hanging over us god can still show certain people what he wants to do with you so if we're going to apply that to ourselves for example in john 1 and 1 uh 40 and 40 and 51 andrew and simon andrew and simon were well first andrew was with uh with john the baptist listen to john the baptist preached and john the baptist says a statement like behold the the son of god behold the lamb of god and andrew says wait i'm gonna andrew and somebody else said i'm gonna follow him there was something inside andrew that drew him to follow the messiah okay now as you see that and andrew and his friend decided to follow the messiah and the andrew decided hey i i realized that this is the messiah i'm going to go tell peter yeah so he goes and tells peter so there's there's a a a a scenery look opening up of how god can call a person out of where they're at remember they were jews in jerusalem following the the sanhedrin following the the high priest uh bringing their sacrifices doing all the things that that uh perf that day was do it was calling them to reading the books of moses the old testament but yet there was a message come forth through john the baptist that showed them that there was coming and they knew there was coming a messiah and brother branham paraphrases that or tells a little story how their dad their dad was explaining to them saying the messiah's coming and maybe i'm too old to be there for you guys well he's maybe fishing out there with simon that andrew he's fishing out there and he says but god has always provided for us but you know if if i go by way of the grave i just want to let you know watch out for him watch out for him the messiah is coming and he's going to be a person that knows the very secrets and intenses of the heart so here comes uh uh andrew until simon and simon goes down there to see him and jesus tells him you're the son of jonas he says well how did you know my dad how did you know my dad my dad was very faithful how did you know about him okay then you see that uh in the same town where andrew and simon lived was a was philip and i don't know if philip was the second person there but he comes over to nathan nathanael and tells him come and see the messiah come and see the man that i that we found we he's the i we think he's the messiah and nathanael says can anything good come out of nazareth so notice god was revealing to certain people calling certain people to follow a word for their day a word for their day so what is it even though the sky is red and luring judgment is hanging upon this day and age there's something that's going that calls the people of god to the their position in god amen amen so you know the story about nathanael and and how how how when nathaniel sees sees jesus jesus comes back and says says uh when you were under the fig tree i saw you that's right and nathaniel says i was praying under the fig tree you know brother branham's uh portrayal of it i was praying under the fig tree and he says you're the messiah you're the king of israel you're the you're the the you know he gave a testimony there and peter and jesus says because because i told you i saw you under the fig tree you say this you'll see greater things than this and he now you take a look you take a look on our calling this you know uh uh god shows people some things and i want to say that that each and every one of us have a testimony my testimony personally i was in the world and not wanting to serve god i was actually a couple of times i uh i simply said you know what you know devil if you'll give me money i'll sell my soul to you you know that's how bad i was and and and and i said uh and and why did he want to buy my soul he had it but but nevertheless uh i i was that way you know and i would wear these levi's jackets with a big serpent on the back and and at my young age teenage i would sit on top of the washing machine and and listen to all the grown-ups talk and very very catholic my family was and i'm sitting there with a big old serpent on the back of my jacket pretending to be mr tough guy yeah and one day on the same kitchen table right across from that washing machine i'm sitting there on top of the washing machine and my uncle comes in with the realtor reel recorder and he plays the sermon called deep colleth to the deep and i listen to the guy in there and then i kind of get off the washing machine and and i sit down on the on the bench that was on the side of the table and listen to that guy in there and he gets to the very end of the tape and i start seeing in the tape i'm listening to the healing service deep calling today preached in albuquerque and i says nobody can do that nobody can do that nobody knows those secrets nobody knows that he didn't know those people but yet he could tell them who they were what's wrong with them what the doctor said how they're going to re how they're going to recover i stayed listening to that then i then he my uncle brought over another tape and the other tape was uh was was serpent seed uh and and and so i listened to those two i think i listened to another one a world falling apart preached in albuquerque and i got up from there and walking around the the the barns and stuff i started crying out to god and i come back in and mom's mom's there uh cooking and stuff and i i tell her mom you know you you heard those things we heard last night on those tapes and she says yeah i said mom i said this is real we owe our lives to this we owe our lives to this and so so from there on in i mean uh uh well my mom suffered a lot because when she went and got baptized in in in the name of jesus christ by submersion uh that put a big old stir in the catholic church about her and so they started calling they her brothers and stuff were calling her up and calling her a horse being so stubborn because of what she's doing and how come she's leaving her faith and all these things and uh and i i you know she suffered a lot from her family because she left the left the catholic church but nevertheless she held to it and sure enough uh you know when we'd invite brothers to come up and have services up there my wife came to several of those services up there in in in rocia where we lived and uh as a little girl and what what happened was uh the family uh you know they come to me one day and says what are you doing why are you inviting all these people what are they coming to get a free vacation is what are they what's their idea what are they doing coming up here like that what what's what's the big deal which is we want to be around the people of god we want to we want to hear the things of god so so they said they said well you're all you're doing is just running yourself to the poor house how do you feed all these people and this i says it doesn't matter god will provide them we we need to we need to hear from god so that was the start of something pulling in my heart when when so we start to see that that that look at the wise men something told them to follow the star because the christ was there okay look at mary you know mary a a a young virgin maybe she read the scripture a virgin shall conceive she didn't know it was gonna be her but when the angel came and told her it's you she said be it unto me according to that word she was willing to accept what god was saying she her part was to play now we come and we start to look at our own lives and how we live what we're to what we're doing here in in lula and and in the in the in the message of this hour we start to look are we are we doing the very same kind of things right you know the bible the bible wants us to show who we are because he he because god reveals to us you know uh you know when when when when god was was was wanting to reveal himself see you realize we'll open up the waterway you know in the scripture we talk about we talk about uh about the the prophet telling them you know dig ditches so you can support all the water that's coming they're digging ditches in a dry desert yeah and he says dig ditches because you're gonna have to support all the water that's coming amen and now we so here we were and you realize that god's wanting to pour out a blessing so big that we can hardly contain it amen that's right and and we we start to look at the bible wants to show us and reveal to us himself and open his word to you so what are we doing you know excuse me my throat lasts for a little bit but then it starts to give up amen but uh brother dale had cough drops in there about a few hours amen so what happens then we start to look and we see that that the word of god wanting to reveal itself you say uh you know when we start to ask you know you know you start to ask questions we know in in let's let's go over to uh matthew 16 13. and this is uh of course i got uh this this little story was on three of the gospels in mark 8 and in luke 9 and 18 it was all those three places it's talked about but in matthew 16 16 the 13th chapter jesus says whom do men say that i the son of man am. and the disciples answered and said well some say you're some say you're john the baptist some say you're elijah some say or one of the other prophets so and you know if you continue on and you read your scriptures you'll start to see that the pharisees say you're beelzebub the sadducees say you're a devil this the uh in in saint john 2 and 15 uh the uh the sanhedrin in the temple and the temple guards saw you uh make a whip of cords and whip out all those people they say you're a terrorist because you uh you you you want to just uh mess up the the system that we have you know they say you're you're you're you're you're just want to change things you know uh they said they called him angry or mad doing that you say okay the the the you could say dr james dobson focus on the family uh they're all saying well you're a family destroyer you don't want to build up the family you want to tear it down the temple of the the dr james dobson in in in in in on the radio or on the web uh they're saying that jesus was trying a family destroyer because in matthew 10 yeah uh matthew 10 34 and to 38 let's go over there and read it real quick because matthew it says i didn't come to bring a what's it where is it think i guess i didn't mark that right 10 34 to 38 okay earth peace but a sword okay that's it that's matthew what 10 34. yeah all right got it matthew 10 34. okay think ye think not that i am come to send peace on the earth i come not to send peace but a sword for i am come to set man in v in vengeance and vengeance in variance against the father and the and the daughter against her mother and the daughter in in law against the uh against her mother in against her mother-in-law and a man's foes shall be they of his own household amen so you start to see that god if if family life radio or or or or they say focus on the family god's saying really what he's saying is if you love your father or mother more than me you're not worthy of me amen so jesus you say well is jesus trying to raise himself up well of course he's trying to raise himself up because his word is eternal amen amen so in short not everybody spoke good of jesus but you start to see that hey this message is becoming such a a controversial thing where they'll take what the net says they'll take what the radio says they'll take what they're what they're putting out wherever somebody can build a platform to speak but they'll take that to say that hey it's not real right but you know not everybody spoke good of jesus and when you talk about the message of sour or brother branham directly when you talk about brother branham you start to see that not everybody says good things about him some people call him a fortune teller a medium a wizard a hypnotist he was grabbing for money that's not true we can tell that he was uh looking to make himself somebody great or or popular of course they can't say that he was after women but you could start seeing that look they they they call him a false prophet that's going to raise up at the end time an antichrist one of the antichrists of the last days what is going on where where are they getting all this from some say that they some say that he he started uh uh he started as a prophet a good prophet of god but he went astray at the end god uh put him in an accident and took him off the scene some people say that but what happens some people say that but some people say other things too t.l osborne said he was uh that he saw he saw christ in the man christ in the flesh so you say you you say well and and others say well he was he was jesus christ resurrected so there's a balance you can't just go from one extreme to another other some people call them false some people call him real some people call jesus false some people call jesus real but we stand to live for what he represents in our lives we stand to hold for what he's moving in our lives how he's revealing himself to you and through you amen so you see what happens we we realize that in the days that we live in that we're coming to the place that you know that the judgment is hanging over this nation judgment's hanging over the world and if we don't have our place in this ministry if we don't have our we don't take our place in the five-fold we don't take our place as believers of this truth if we don't look at what god's doing in your day and your age to bring you to a rapturing faith we realize the rapture is right at hand and if you don't stand to live for god in the ways that's called heresy paul called it heresy paul called it he said in the way that's called heresy that's the way i live for jesus christ that's the way i i produce this word if you look at paul they called him mad you're mad your wisdom has made you mad amen and you say well yeah it does look like i'm mad but you know what i i want everybody to serve god except for these chains see he was recognizing his day and his hour and what he was to live for he couldn't go back to the sanhedrin he couldn't go back to them and say look i'll follow your ways i'll persecute the christians he couldn't go back why because the vision that he had of jesus christ was enough to show him that i can go back to the scripture and see that in jesus was the fulfillment of all the word that was hidden through the ages so what happens if you stand here and you start to look at the things that are said about the message of this hour about the things that god has done in our day and age and you stand back and you start to claim hey this really wasn't uh what they claim it is and you start to say look i have never seen anything like this you know when they were when they were persecuting jesus and they the the soldiers the soldiers came up to to to uh they they were going to arrest the the the lord and and the in the the sanhedrin or the the scribes and pharisees said to the soldiers how come you don't arrest this man they said never a man spoke like this man never a man spoke like this man i you know he said are you crazy too do you see the priest following him right and you know what when they tell me you know that uh brother branham is false all i can say is i listen to the tapes never a man spoke like this man i can't see i can only see jesus christ in that man that's all i can see and what happens what happens we stand to live for a gospel that's been publicly portrayed before us you know you say well i stand here and i realize that the the god that was in paul the god that was manifesting himself through peter is the same god that was doing the works through brother branham and the same god that will do his work through the five-fold ministry in our message right now if you still if you you know if if ever you think that you you can't reach out and touch god because you're in a place where god has manifested himself time and time again you stand to say well look what good is it all amen what do i have if i don't have this right if this word is false i stand to lose everything you know i i i i mean my soul especially where do i stand you can only stand on what's truth the scripture proves itself yes right but then we go back let me talk a little bit about about what i've seen through this okay i'm talking about red sky in the morning still judgment you know there has to be a falling away there has to be people that fulfill the word of the great falling away there's going to be people that are going to take the way and say oh brother branham was a false prophet yeah so they called jesus a false prophet they called paul the false prophet they called all the christians a false false false they called they if they call our lord how much more that will they call his people amen so they they may call they'll call brother brother dale that he's a a false minister following a false message but you start to look at the word of god that's been manifest for our day and you can't say that we can't say that we the believer can't say that why because we're believers amen amen so so we stand here we look at that the rapture's at hand you know the scriptures of the rapture you you read the scriptures of the rapture and you start to look at the scriptures the rapture the rapture says and the rapture says that the the shout is and brother brown said the shout is a message going forth right so if you start to look at it the shout happened already so the rapture's it's on its way the rapture started already okay and it's just coming to a place where as the revelation that god is revealing for our day to bring us to the right place in the right position will manifest itself in the changing of our bodies amen changing of our bodies there are youth come you know what happened to paul i mean to uh to uh uh abraham and sarah what happened to abraham and sarah they became young again how come they became young again because the manifested promised word finally came to pass they became young again received the promised son hallelujah sarah died right away but that doesn't matter that doesn't matter because we realize that the truth of the word of god still came to pass amen so we still look at malachi 4 and 1. and we look at the judgment hanging over the world the nation the peoples and we and that they'll burn up and be like an oven and we still see that the word of god has promised to abride a changing of a body amen the changing of the body and the and the rapture of the church amen paul won't see paul again we'll see peter again we'll see all the saints of old coming to life again and we'll be going up with them amen in a rapture amen so we'll we we recognize that as we take hold of what god's doing in our day and age it's going to make up change it makes a change first of all in us mentally spiritually we don't do the things we used to do but most of all it brings us to a revelation that god is doing a work for you today amen god is yeah god has has had secrets through the ages amen you know if i was looking at some of the secrets you know uh daniel uh daniel 12 12 and 12-9 it says that the the the the lord said close up the vision and its prophecies in in revelations 10 he was john was told hold these things that the seven thunders uttered and write them not for therefore the time of the end so we're starting to look at hey the things that been hid through the ages the messenger of the hour will will bring a truth there that will open your understanding to scriptures hidden through the ages and the people are saying well we want to go back to the bible we want to go back to the bible if they're going to go back to the bible without the revelation of what god's revealed in this day and age they're going to go back to what the baptists have a dead letter amen amen the catholics had a dead letter and and then go start making a lot of doctrines out of it but they don't have the truth of what god's doing in there where god's revealing and bringing these things you know bringing a clearness of it i dropped the paper here bringing a a clearness of of what god's doing in the day and age and not only that it wasn't just that he was clearly clarifying all these things it was vindicated showing you that this is truth because the signs and wonders that came behind it amen what kind of signs and wonders are you talking about okay restoration of several things you know malachi 4 5 and 6 tells us that there's going to be a return to pentecost that's what i'm saying it's a return to god manifesting himself in his people again that's what the the pentecost really that's what malachi uh was to malachi 4 and 5 messenger what's to do now what are we looking at okay what have we had in this 20th century return of visions you know brother we were through the denominations we we were back there for years there was nobody having visions okay supernatural voices speaking to you nobody was getting that there was no supernatural voices oh we read their bibles yeah we heard things we didn't hear hear supernatural voices uh coming from would avoid an angel visitation would you ever hear of all the angels visiting you no angels visiting explaining to you the scriptures telling you about your peculiar it was telling brother brown about his peculiar life how it was go because there was a work for him to do when he got older okay appearances of the pillar of fire there was nothing like that we didn't have no pillar of fire in the catholic church we didn't have no no no healing of the sick not even cancer would stand before the prayer we didn't have none of that i mean we just died that was it and the catholic church didn't give you any promises they said all you have to do is die you know you just gotta stay in the faith and die yeah so but there was no no uh no hopes of of of of of a miracle amen uh the raising of the dead we never heard of anything like that uh revealing of the bible mystery secrets that have been hid through the ages nobody looked for those things okay what happened uh discerning of spirits there was nobody could do that there was nobody could could produce those things the ability to show uh show jesus christ presence amongst us to bring jesus christ out of history and show him publicly right in front of you manifesting himself right in front of you praying for i mean healing you people right out in front of you nobody could bring jesus out of out of history like that the voice of god coming out of heaven all those things what is it we're looking at a day in age when these things have become manifested these things have been shown these things have proven itself for real in our day and age a powerful mystery not even i mean you you you you read about it in the book of acts but you're seeing it in our day so what are we looking for then we're looking for a reality a real god that's doing the very same thing you know the the the the things have been uh chopped off the nicean council cut off water baptism they cut off the the true name of or should i say gave the father son the holy ghost uh titles and took away the the one true god and you start to look at all the things that have been cut off through the ages those all those truths had to come and be manifested in our day and age to bring us to a reality of a living god living amongst us manifesting yourself through your brethren through the people that you fellowship with manifesting itself now look things had been hidden through the ages like you know who who did foot washing in the denominations that was all gone who did who did who used the lemon bread uh cooked by the sisters or or something like that no we got salty crackers uh we bought them at the store uh grape juice we used to use grape juice because prohibition says we shouldn't be drinking alcohol yeah we're using grape juice for communion uh where uh what what happened to the to the uh what happened what happened to the the truth about marriage and divorce the truth about the positions in the household those things were all thrown nobody had any understanding of where the husband's place is where a wife's place is where the children's place is who speaks to the children who speaks to the husband and how the how the the that jesus is over the husband okay they didn't there was no place in positioning in the household no fivefold ministry and where their position is it was all uh ahead headaches or hierarchies or or are part of the denomination uh elders and and bishop district district prisoners and stuff like that going all the way up the ladder but you never really got to where you knew that you're doing a work of god in your life amen amen we start to look as we get ready to close it i i realize that you know the scriptures hebrews 11 the fathers of the faith we realize hebrews 12 1 and 2 it says let me go over there real quick i think brother i'll put it up real quick as we close we stand to our feet the musicians can go ahead and come up let me go over to hebrews 12. i did not mark this one so bear with me hebrews 12. as i call brother dale back to the pulpit wherefore seeing that we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith that's right so as we look at all those saints that have gone on and all of us who are coming on we realize that of course hebrews the uh 11th chapter and to me it's the 40th birth god having provided some better things for us that they without us should not be made perfect god's looking for us to take our position in the fathers of faith amen amen let's pray thank you our dear and precious lord lord god as uh i've taken the scripture lord god and taking the things that you've said lord god and trying to bring a reality to a people or god of a day and age lord jesus when all things lord god are are they're trying to bring them into question but lord jesus we can't question your word lord god we can't question your divine inspiration that has been brought to us in this day and age lord god to bring us to a reality of a living god lord jesus says we stand here lord god believing in you having faith to know lord jesus that you're going to finish the work in your people or god i pray o lord jesus you manifest yourself through us all our god help us lord jesus to live for you all the days of our lives lord god as we come to the rapturing of the church lord god the returning of the saints in jerusalem lord god we pray o lord jesus that you help us lord god to to manifest lord jesus every aspect of what your spirit wants us to do in this day and age anoint the

day and age oh god bless them each and every one lord help us lord god keep it lord god keep us all o lord jesus with you first and foref in the forefront of our lives lord god in jesus name amen there was one other point that i was going to tell you about which i caught it it's strange i caught it it was said uh if you ever look at john the book of john and look up the mark of the beast 666 it's interesting uh let's go over there real quick saint john saint john 6 chapter 6 verse 66 and what it says is let me go there real quick saint john 6 and verse 66 and this is a proclamation that i thought was interesting it says from from that time many of his disciples went back amen and walked no more with him so you see this was right when jesus preached that sermon and said said you eat my flesh and drink my blood 666 tells you that they the the the the disciples that were following jesus the 70 the the the multitudes that were following went no more with him backing away from god knowing what god has done and knowing what where knowing the the word of the lord and then walking away from it it truly is the mark of the beast but peter's confession is this jesus and simon peter answered him lord to whom will we go amen thou hast the words of eternal life amen and we believe and are sure that thou art the christ the son of the living god amen that's right amen let that be your profession amen everywhere god bless you amen let your let your light so shine amen and like i said we do we owe our lives to this amen amen god bless you brother bless you enjoy the message
