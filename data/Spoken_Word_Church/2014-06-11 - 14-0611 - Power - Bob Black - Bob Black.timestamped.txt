[9:06] verse 18.
[9:08] and also Romans chapter 1 verse 16.
[9:13] God is so good isn't he I just
[9:17] sorry
[9:18] he just keeps getting greater and
[9:19] greater glory
[9:22] and I know he never changes so I must be
[9:25] changing
[9:36] I believe his power is still the same
[9:38] yesterday today and forever he's still
[9:40] able to heal and save and deliver his
[9:43] power is still the same with us and
[9:46] that's what I want to talk about about
[9:48] today
[9:52] Let's uh
[9:55] let's go to the Lord in prayer before we
[9:57] read this scripture
[9:59] Lord God we thank you Lord for your
[10:01] presence this afternoon tonight
[10:03] thank you God for your grace to us Lord
[10:05] to open your word to us Lord and Lord
[10:08] we're reminded Lord that you know about
[10:11] 2 000 years ago you
[10:14] were put down in the grave and they had
[10:17] stuck you in the side and piercedured
[10:19] hands and your feet and Lord you laid in
[10:22] that grave but then
[10:24] couple days three days later you Rose in
[10:27] Victory
[10:28] and you carried forth the torch of
[10:31] freedom and liberty and Power
[10:33] and Lord there was a purpose to that
[10:35] Lord Jesus it wasn't just to be a story
[10:37] but Lord God you made a way you told
[10:40] your disciples you gave them that Great
[10:42] Commission to take this gospel all over
[10:44] the world and preach the power of a
[10:47] resurrected Christ and Lord Jesus I pray
[10:50] God tonight they will see that you're
[10:52] still the same you're still living among
[10:55] us today Lord God it's the same as you
[10:57] always were God granted Lord Jesus said
[11:00] we'll see you alive tonight visible
[11:02] Among Us Lord Jesus that's what we're
[11:04] looking for Lord God
[11:06] Open the Eyes of our hearts Lord Jesus
[11:08] to see you God I pray Lord that you'll
[11:11] help me to speak your word and close my
[11:13] mouth to my own opinion Lord Jesus but
[11:16] God I pray Lord let your grant us Lord
[11:18] Mercy Lord tonight did you come and

[11:27] power Among Us Lord Jesus God prove
[11:30] yourself among us tonight Lord I pray
[11:32] and we're looking we're looking and
[11:34] expecting Lord Jesus and we know that
[11:36] it's written in your word that you would
[11:37] appear to those who look to you who look
[11:40] for your appearing Lord Jesus God
[11:42] granted I pray Lord Jesus bless this
[11:44] service we ask bless the reading of your
[11:46] word in the name of the Lord Jesus
[11:48] Christ
[11:52] First Corinthians chapter 1 verse 18.
[11:57] for the preaching of the Cross is to
[11:59] then the parish foolishness
[12:01] but unto us which are saved it is the
[12:03] power of God
[12:05] and then let's read Romans
[12:09] from chapter one
[12:11] verse 16.
[12:16] excuse me a little bit my nose is
[12:18] starting to run
[12:20] foreign
[12:23] of the gospel of Christ
[12:26] for it is the power of God unto
[12:29] salvation to everyone that believeth
[12:31] to the Jew first and also to the Greek
[12:35] you may be seated the Lord had his
[12:37] Blessing to the reading of the word
[12:40] I I believe that
[12:43] just reading the word you'll be blessed
[12:46] even if you don't understand it all
[12:48] fully you know something is strange
[12:51] happened yesterday we had a little
[12:53] that got me really thinking we had a a
[12:55] chicken
[12:57] thank you brother you bless your heart
[13:01] we had a chicken that had a little it
[13:04] had a little brood of eggs and it it
[13:06] hatched it only only one of them hatched
[13:10] and that little baby chicken was running
[13:11] around just peeping and everything
[13:14] and
[13:15] we went uh the little kids went out in
[13:18] the yard yesterday and
[13:19] come to find out that that Mama chicken
[13:22] and a lot of other chickens in the yard
[13:24] had turned on that little baby chicken
[13:26] and began to pick it to death
[13:29] and it broke couple of its toes and just
[13:31] in a horrible situation and a little Zoe
[13:34] ran out and rescued it and and she now
[13:37] sees this mama we're joking about but
[13:40] you know I I got to thinking about how a
[13:43] lot in the message a lot of people
[13:45] Believers will kind of they'll put their
[13:49] put their their their uh your their
[13:53] faith and their hope and somebody and
[13:55] expect them to to lead them on to the to
[13:58] the truth and to lead them on to the
[14:00] power of God and then it comes to turn
[14:02] out that that that that person that they
[14:05] put all their hopes on it turned against
[14:07] them now when you're talking about I
[14:10] want to talk take a little topic this
[14:12] morning about power when you're talking
[14:14] about power when you're talking about
[14:16] these these things these scriptures that
[14:18] we just read it's important to find
[14:19] somebody who knows what they're talking
[14:22] about because if you if you find
[14:25] somebody you know one time Jesus sat
[14:27] around maybe the little campfire outside
[14:29] with his disciples and he began to ask
[14:32] them and the acquire of them who knew
[14:35] what who he was
[14:37] who knew what they were talking about it
[14:40] as he went around the circle he he asked
[14:42] who do you say that I am and he he asked
[14:45] each disciple and turned and some said
[14:47] well some say this some say that and you
[14:51] know that's how many many Believers
[14:52] today are doing well some say that he
[14:55] was that some say this about God some
[14:58] say this about the message and don't
[15:00] really know have an absolute that they
[15:02] can turn to to know what the gospel is
[15:05] all about what what the power of the
[15:07] Gospel is about but you know then then
[15:10] Jesus turned to Peter and he found
[15:12] somebody that knew what they were
[15:14] talking about and Peter gave an answer
[15:16] he said I know that thou art the Christ
[15:18] the son of the Living God and I like
[15:21] that because he said he knew that God
[15:23] was the same yesterday today and forever
[15:25] he knew that he wasn't just somebody
[15:27] from a history book he knew that he was
[15:29] walking and living right among him today
[15:31] I believe I want to confess to you now
[15:34] that he is still walking and living
[15:36] among us today he's still walking in the
[15:39] candlesticks he's still walking he's
[15:42] alive and well and that's that's my
[15:44] declaration tonight is that the power of
[15:47] God is still living among us today able
[15:50] able to deliver us able to save us save
[15:52] us able to fill us with the Holy Ghost
[15:54] able to give us whatever things we have
[15:57] need of and maybe the question I want to
[16:00] ask is how do we get access to that
[16:03] power
[16:04] what is the way what is the path what is
[16:07] the formula to getting access to that
[16:09] power now you know there's a lot of
[16:12] emphasis today in in the world today on
[16:15] what on power it seems like everybody's
[16:17] after power and you look around you know
[16:21] that you ate my work there's all these
[16:23] different politics people are trying to
[16:25] amass different products projects under
[16:27] different people and trying to get
[16:29] influence and and uh you can take it on
[16:33] up the the political ladder on up to
[16:34] your local governor and your mayor and
[16:37] all up all the way and what they're
[16:39] trying to do is influence someone to
[16:41] their idea and that's the way power
[16:44] works because power is always something
[16:47] that changes it produces change you take
[16:50] something in one state and then put it
[16:51] in another you take electricity at the
[16:54] train I ride and you funnel that
[16:56] electricity through the wires and the
[16:58] train begins to move because power
[17:00] produces change you take you take
[17:04] somebody a political person of political
[17:07] power and they're changing your ideas
[17:09] based on their speech and they're trying
[17:12] to move somebody mood produce change
[17:15] from one place to another and that's
[17:17] what power does
[17:19] the ability to produce change and uh
[17:25] power I was thinking about uh the the
[17:29] ocean how power is like you can go down
[17:31] to the ocean and look at the a lot of
[17:34] many years uh
[17:35] in the past my family will uh my brother
[17:39] and my my dad and I will we'll all we
[17:41] would take kayaks down to the ocean and
[17:43] in the winter when nobody else is there
[17:45] when it's not polluted and uh
[17:50] and we'll take kayaks and put them in
[17:52] the ocean and and ride the waves and go
[17:54] out and my brother likes to go out and
[17:56] and do deep sea fishing he'll go out
[17:58] like a mile in his kayak or out where
[18:00] the Dolphins and things are and where
[18:02] you can't hardly see him but you get
[18:04] into that little kayak and get in the
[18:05] ocean and the waves begin to toss you to
[18:07] and fro and you realize that that ocean
[18:09] has some power and it can move you and
[18:12] toss you over and and uh turn you upside
[18:15] down and before you know it you're
[18:17] you're in a in a shape and but you know
[18:20] one thing about the ocean is there's
[18:23] natural power that should be respected
[18:25] and there's natural beauty in that thing
[18:28] and if you if you come out and you can
[18:31] just stand by the ocean and listen to
[18:33] the power of the waves and you begin to
[18:35] think about God and how how that he
[18:38] rolled off the worlds from his finger by
[18:41] the word of his mouth and he'd be he all
[18:43] these things he put in place and and you
[18:46] know what happens is that man comes in
[18:49] and they changes what God produced in
[18:51] his natural beauty in his natural estate
[18:53] and they come in and build up these
[18:55] great big Condominiums and and sports
[18:57] complexes and and uh entertainment
[19:00] things and they come in and pollute it
[19:02] with the uh you can't even go out with
[19:05] your eyes open anymore in the summertime
[19:08] that's the way that man takes the power
[19:11] of God and pollutes it and that's that's
[19:14] kind of what I'm getting at is how do we
[19:17] get access to God God's power how do we
[19:20] how do we take advantage what is how do
[19:24] we get in hooked into the conduit where
[19:26] we have access to God's power
[19:28] and
[19:31] it's not by man's ideas it's by by
[19:35] hearing to God's word by sticking to
[19:38] God's word now let me let's Circle back
[19:40] around this little verse we read in
[19:42] Romans 1 16 for I am not ashamed of the
[19:46] gospel of Christ for it is the power of
[19:48] God unto salvation to everyone that
[19:50] believeth to the Jew first and also to
[19:52] the Greek it doesn't matter whether you
[19:55] have a historical claim of as a Jew or
[19:58] whether you're one of these heathens
[20:00] that came up with all of the this
[20:02] Pantheon of different gods and just a
[20:05] Pagan religion it doesn't matter if you
[20:08] have the revelation of the access to the
[20:11] power of God you can take advantage of
[20:13] this and now I I want to kind of ask if
[20:16] you knew down all through the the the
[20:19] history of the Church of the Bible
[20:22] men were looking for the secret to the
[20:25] access to to the way to access the power
[20:27] of God and if you knew how to do that
[20:31] would you want to keep it a secret would
[20:34] you want to reserve it for yourself why
[20:37] you'd want to you don't want to tell the
[20:39] world you'd want to you want to
[20:40] advertise it to the world you wouldn't
[20:42] be ashamed of it and I I find many today
[20:45] seem like there I was talking privately
[20:48] to a few uh different people and one one
[20:52] person told me they they while they
[20:56] wouldn't want you know the the world to
[20:58] find out that what they believed because
[21:01] then what if things went wrong didn't
[21:03] they'd show up on their doorstep and and
[21:06] start hunting them down and I'm trying
[21:08] to speak in a clouded way so you
[21:10] wouldn't be able to find out who that
[21:13] was but you know
[21:16] afraid afraid that people would find out
[21:20] where what kind of gospel they believe
[21:23] and I believe maybe that they they don't
[21:26] understand the power of the gospel
[21:28] because the gospel is not just about
[21:30] do's and don'ts but the gospel is about
[21:33] the power of a living Christ Living
[21:35] inside of you walking and giving you
[21:37] power to overcome the things of the
[21:39] world it's not about legalism and
[21:41] Colossians 2 chapter chapter 2 20 verse
[21:45] 20-23 Paul said wherefore if ye be dead
[21:48] with Christ through the rudiments of the
[21:50] world why is there living in the world
[21:52] are you subject to ordinances touch not
[21:54] taste not handle not which all are to
[21:56] perish whether using after the
[21:58] Commandments and doctrines of men
[22:00] which things have indeed a show of
[22:02] wisdom and will worship and humility and
[22:04] nicolating of the body not in any honor
[22:07] to the satisfying of the flesh
[22:09] now that's your little scripture on
[22:10] legalism because if you if you try to do
[22:13] it right you try to have an hour show
[22:15] you try to impress your neighbor with
[22:17] how Pious and everything you are then
[22:19] that that's all well and good it appears
[22:21] great but it doesn't do anything to
[22:24] satisfy the flesh you still you're still
[22:27] going to have problems and and things
[22:29] but what I'm talking about is a power
[22:32] that can deliver you from the desire of
[22:34] the things of this world the power that
[22:35] can deliver you from the desire of
[22:37] alcohol drugs uh pornography whatever
[22:41] all these things that make you walk a
[22:43] holy life and be a holy vessel before
[22:45] the Lord God this is a power that that
[22:48] it seems like uh many people today have
[22:51] begun to deny that the power of God is
[22:53] still present because if you say that
[22:55] you've got to buy legalism God to strive
[22:58] every day to to to to to to walk a holy
[23:02] life that that is your Holiness by you
[23:04] know getting rid of a Christmas tree or
[23:06] you know I don't want to step on any
[23:08] Toes or anything but
[23:09] by trying to do those things instead of
[23:12] the spirit of God living you and change
[23:14] you by his power that's the power that
[23:17] I'm speaking of now let me let me uh
[23:19] to to talk about this a little bit more
[23:22] let's go over to Acts chapter four
[23:24] I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus
[23:27] Christ
[23:30] Acts chapter 4 is what happened after
[23:33] the what was described after uh
[23:37] the Peter and John went into the temple
[23:40] and and walked up to the lame man and
[23:43] said we don't have any silver or gold
[23:45] but what we do have
[23:47] what we do have is power with God
[23:50] we'll give that to you and they said
[23:53] rise up and walk in the name of the Lord
[23:57] and
[23:59] so after that
[24:01] then they began to be chapter Acts
[24:05] chapter 4 verse 1 as they spake unto the
[24:07] people the priests and the captain of
[24:09] the temple and the Sadducees Came Upon
[24:11] them being grieved that they taught the
[24:12] people and preached through Jesus the
[24:15] resurrection from the dead
[24:17] because now when people see that Christ
[24:19] is made and manifest and is visible then
[24:22] it it makes him rile up and makes him
[24:25] mad and you know that shouldn't be
[24:27] unexpected it should be expected that
[24:30] there will be a little a little Grievous
[24:32] and they laid hands on them and put them
[24:34] in hold unto the next day for it was now
[24:36] Eventide
[24:37] it seems like when you have power a lot
[24:40] of things looking back through scripture
[24:42] things are almost flip-flopped and it
[24:45] seems like you know when Jesus most
[24:47] powerful hour because he said I have
[24:49] power to lay my life down and I have
[24:51] power to raise it up again he was in
[24:54] control the whole time he was in total
[24:57] control it looked like that the power
[24:58] had been taken away from him but he was
[25:01] he was in control the whole time at that
[25:03] most that it seemed like that critical
[25:06] hour he was maybe more power than than
[25:09] his whole Ministry
[25:12] and they laid hands on them and put them
[25:15] in hold under the next day for it was
[25:17] now even tied I'll be at many of them
[25:18] which heard the word believed and the
[25:21] number of the men was about five
[25:22] thousand
[25:24] and it came to pass on the mara
[25:28] did their rulers and scribes and annists
[25:30] the high priest and Caiaphas and John
[25:31] and Alexander And as many as were of the
[25:33] Kindred of the high priest were gathered
[25:34] together at Jerusalem and when they had
[25:37] set them in the midst they asked by what
[25:38] power or by what by what name have you
[25:41] done this how have you done this did you
[25:44] do it by your own power and that's what
[25:46] uh and then really in in many in the
[25:51] denominational circles is what what
[25:53] what's happening is they're trying to
[25:54] accrue to themselves power and they do
[25:56] it just the same way that Balaam did by
[25:59] trying to convert people to his own way
[26:02] of thinking and instead of building
[26:04] create taking people to the power of the
[26:07] Living God they're taking people to the
[26:09] power of their own ideas and their own
[26:11] thoughts they have a power a power of a
[26:14] church a little power but that's not the
[26:17] power that's what I I want to take you
[26:19] to is is the power of Christ
[26:23] and then it's the high priest and
[26:25] Caiaphas and John and Alexander And as
[26:27] many as were the Kinder the high priest
[26:28] will gather together at Jerusalem when
[26:29] they had set them in the midst they
[26:31] asked by what power by what name have
[26:32] you done this then Peter filled with the
[26:35] Holy Ghost said unto them you rulers of
[26:36] the people and Elders of Israel if we
[26:38] this day be examined of the good deed
[26:40] done to the infinite Man by what means
[26:42] he has made whole be it known unto you
[26:43] all and to all the people of Israel that
[26:46] by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
[26:48] whom he crucified whom God raised from
[26:51] the dead even by him does this man stand
[26:54] here before you whole now Peter wasn't
[26:56] afraid to tell it like it was he wasn't
[26:58] afraid even though he was in danger
[27:00] being thrown into jail you know I say
[27:03] this because there are many people many
[27:05] ministers today believe it or not who
[27:07] are afraid of being thrown into jail who
[27:09] are afraid of being found out because of
[27:12] the Gospel that they Proclaim to preach
[27:14] the gospel is not just do this and do
[27:17] that that's not that's there's no power
[27:19] in that but there's a power in the
[27:21] gospel that will cause you that will
[27:23] make you as a second Peter where we're
[27:25] talking about the Statue of the perfect
[27:27] man it will make you conform to that
[27:29] make these these virtues rebirth into
[27:31] you it will make you grow into the
[27:33] stature into the fullness of a of a
[27:35] perfect man
[27:36] and he said uh
[27:40] be it known unto you all he wasn't
[27:42] afraid to tell the whole world
[27:44] this is the stone which was said it in
[27:46] all of you Builders which has become the
[27:48] head of the corner neither is their
[27:50] salvation and any other for there is
[27:52] none other name under Heaven given among
[27:54] men whereby we must be saved now there's
[27:57] an answer there's a good answer for
[27:59] those that say the name of of God is
[28:01] Yahweh or Jehovah's Witness or whatever
[28:03] there is none other name under Heaven
[28:05] given among men whereby we must be saved
[28:08] and he said he did this in the name of
[28:10] the Lord Jesus Christ and you can't say
[28:12] it's just in the name of the Lord Jesus
[28:14] Christ it's not just tacking that on to
[28:16] the end of your prayer but that's a
[28:18] personal experience what God is living
[28:20] inside of you and then you can say in
[28:22] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[28:24] anybody can tack that on to the end of
[28:26] their prayer but if you have a personal
[28:28] revelation of who he is and the power of
[28:31] the Living God that he's still living
[28:32] and working among his people then that's
[28:35] the power asking it in his name did you
[28:38] know that brother Branham even said when
[28:39] you ask the blessing of your food he
[28:41] said the way he said it he said I bless
[28:44] this food in the name of the Lord Jesus
[28:47] Christ I bless it because God if God is
[28:50] living in you don't you have power power
[28:52] to bless your food power to power to to
[28:55] bless your children power to pray a
[28:56] prayer of faith and and see the the sick
[29:00] be healed let me testify real quick
[29:03] because that yesterday he he fell and
[29:05] and uh
[29:06] and and twisted his ankle all up and he
[29:10] we were wondering that we might not be
[29:11] able to go to the the thing tomorrow up
[29:14] there and and I I had I was able to work
[29:18] from home today which is why I was here
[29:19] early so I I spent a little bit of time
[29:22] in prayer early this morning and I was
[29:24] praying for him and I come down later
[29:26] and he said I my foot's completely
[29:28] better and it's all better and
[29:32] I believe in the power of prayer and the
[29:35] power of a living God and and that's
[29:38] really what I know this is a simple
[29:40] message but that's what I want to
[29:41] convince you of because the there are
[29:44] many today and maybe many today in this
[29:47] church who who
[29:49] knows I don't know I'm just preaching
[29:51] I'm just casting in
[29:53] that are not convinced of the power of
[29:56] the Living God and I want to I want to
[29:58] talk today about what is limiting our
[30:01] access to the power of God because
[30:03] something's limiting so you know if you
[30:07] those electric wires that power the
[30:09] subway you you know you can't I think
[30:11] brother Aaron and I were talking about
[30:13] it the other day where I was listening
[30:14] to him talk to Zach about how you can
[30:16] expand an electric conduit and it just
[30:19] it'll funnel more electricity more power
[30:22] and so I I won't I and I believe you
[30:26] want to your desire is to be able to
[30:29] have more power from God more power in
[30:32] your life to to uh to walk closer to him
[30:36] to talk close talk with him to interact
[30:39] with him and and you know one day the
[30:41] power if we'll keep following the
[30:42] guidelines and following the
[30:44] prescription one day the power of God
[30:46] will become so real to us that it'll
[30:48] fill every fiber of our being and take
[30:49] us off the Earth
[30:52] and I've often wondered that because you
[30:54] know sometimes in prayer I've I've felt
[30:56] like every fiber of my being was filled
[30:59] with the Holy Ghost with the power of
[31:01] God
[31:02] but one day I still haven't been changed
[31:05] yet but one day it's going to be changed
[31:08] I'm going to be changed to be like him
[31:09] in my flesh because job said in my flesh
[31:12] I said see God
[31:14] now
[31:16] you know another little thing I just I I
[31:19] kind of I kind of I'm taking a little
[31:21] tack of attacking some of the things
[31:24] that I keep hearing because you know
[31:27] I I I was talking to somebody the other
[31:30] day and they said that they were got a
[31:32] great blessing from talking to somebody
[31:33] just an older brother that had been in
[31:36] the meetings of things and he said he
[31:38] made this statement and I'm not in
[31:40] danger of anybody over here in this
[31:41] because this is somebody a long way away
[31:43] and probably wouldn't listen in or
[31:45] whatever but you know if they do it's
[31:46] the truth
[31:49] sometimes the truth hurts if it's the
[31:52] truth
[31:52] but but they said I'll never understand
[31:55] what brother Branham said
[31:58] maybe or they said maybe I don't
[31:59] understand what brother branham's saying
[32:02] but you'll never take away from me that
[32:04] brother Brandon was a prophet now that
[32:07] seems like a real good a real good
[32:09] statement it seems like a you know just
[32:11] on the on the surface just you they're
[32:14] smiling and that's the way it seems like
[32:16] many preachers today
[32:18] I'm going to mention Facebook here so
[32:20] don't don't hurt me but I saw last week
[32:24] on Facebook brother you name James last
[32:27] time so I'm gonna name him names Jeff
[32:28] Jenkins his brother said the last for
[32:31] the last year Jeff Jenkins has been
[32:32] preaching nothing but psychology
[32:34] and and he was pointing fingers at the
[32:37] message Minister saying y'all didn't
[32:39] realize that he was preaching nothing
[32:41] but psychology well that that's what I'm
[32:43] talking about this you can come and and
[32:45] just present a simper and smile and and
[32:48] present well I I don't understand what
[32:51] brother Brandon said I don't understand
[32:53] the things that he taught but I know he
[32:56] was a prophet and that sounds real good
[32:58] but that doesn't provide a conduit to
[33:00] the power of God you got to know that
[33:03] the with the spirit Holy Spirit comes he
[33:06] would bring your remembrance things that
[33:08] are written in the word and show you
[33:09] things to come he'll open up the word to
[33:12] you and I believe today we should be far
[33:15] beyond just saying well I'm I'm part of
[33:17] the assembly I'm part I'm part of the
[33:19] people that say that brother Brandon was
[33:21] a prophet we should be Way Beyond that
[33:23] or if you're at the place where you
[33:26] don't really know whether uh whether
[33:28] brother Branham was you know well you
[33:31] know what
[33:32] what's water what's who's who or
[33:34] anything that that then come on there is
[33:37] a power of God waiting for you to attach
[33:39] on to it and partaking that
[33:42] and there was power and brother Reynolds
[33:45] life you know he he you know I think
[33:48] maybe sometimes we kind of get caught in
[33:50] that many people get called it just
[33:53] we're looking so much at what brother
[33:55] Branham did I heard somebody talk about
[33:57] how that they they were there when they
[34:00] when he they they stood beside him one
[34:03] day when they said can I can I uh let me
[34:05] show you have you ever seen the gift in
[34:08] my hand and he took their hand and put
[34:09] his hand on it and they saw the bumps
[34:11] raise up but you know that power in his
[34:14] life was to make visible to you so that
[34:17] you could believe that the power of God
[34:19] could be in your life maybe not that
[34:21] same way now that's not in that same way
[34:24] where you don't have a gift where it can
[34:26] show up in your hand and you don't have
[34:27] a gift of discernment but the power of
[34:30] God can be so present in your life that
[34:32] you can believe for healing and you can
[34:34] believe that your family can be saved
[34:36] and you can believe it if if God gave
[34:39] you the holy ghost that same Holy Ghost
[34:40] is there to to make all these other
[34:44] promises Manifest this the God is still
[34:47] the same yesterday today and forever and
[34:49] we're not we're not looking for a a
[34:51] gospel of sweetness and humility but
[34:53] we're looking for a God where we almost
[34:56] act like we're on a children's show
[34:57] we're just smiling and simpering and
[34:59] acting acting real chipper and
[35:01] everything but we're acting for a we're
[35:03] looking for a Gospel of Truth and power
[35:06] where the truth is presented maybe
[35:07] sometimes in a hurtful way that's uh
[35:10] what I I was listening sometime recently
[35:13] to brother Branham preached to the Full
[35:15] Gospel businessman and my goodness some
[35:18] of the times he preached to them he just
[35:20] laid it down he said he was getting on
[35:23] them about uh I think it was a singer or
[35:25] something if I remember right he was
[35:26] sometimes y'all get somebody in here
[35:29] that and he just laid it down the line
[35:31] and Mike and you know to think that
[35:34] sometimes he was preaching to those
[35:36] people when the only person that wanted
[35:38] him there was the one that invited him
[35:40] and I don't remember all the details
[35:42] about how how he got invited and
[35:43] everything but just to think about how
[35:46] he presented that gospel and those
[35:48] meetings where nobody wanted him to be
[35:51] there it should be expected that if we
[35:54] demonstrate the gospel and the power and
[35:56] demonstration of the spirit that people
[35:59] will come against us people won't like
[36:00] it because the devil will you know
[36:03] brother Brandon said God allowed the
[36:06] evil spirit to come on Saul to hate
[36:08] David
[36:09] my to make manifest what he believed the
[36:13] power of God in David's life
[36:17] you know I I sometimes I believe it it
[36:21] can really strengthen a Believer to look
[36:23] when somebody when you're claiming the
[36:25] god that God is still alive and well and
[36:28] you're claiming that he's the same
[36:30] yesterday today and forever and people
[36:32] rise up and say Well it can't be done
[36:35] there's no way for you to be healed
[36:37] there's no way for you to get this thing
[36:39] to happen many times in my life I've
[36:41] heard that and you know what I do
[36:44] I run a tattletail yeah yeah I go down
[36:47] that get on my knees and say father God
[36:49] did you hear what they said
[36:53] oh my I think that just really strength
[36:56] that can strengthen your faith of a
[36:57] Believer because you if you know that
[37:00] God is still able that he's alive and
[37:02] well he's able to bring his word to pass
[37:04] and you can stand on it and believe and
[37:06] trust him and the all the world says
[37:09] it's not possible you still stand on it
[37:11] and trust it and and you watch the whole
[37:14] conduit open to the power of God and
[37:16] watch his power work through you that's
[37:19] what I believe now now look look at the
[37:22] difference though there's the power of
[37:24] man and the power of God
[37:27] and see how you know remember Simon the
[37:31] Sorcerer in the in the in the in the
[37:33] book of Acts he he was trying to accrue
[37:36] Power by trying to pull men to his to
[37:39] his Doctrine to his gospel and he told
[37:42] Peter give me also this power
[37:45] when he saw what they were doing that
[37:47] they lay their hands on the uh
[37:48] unbelievers and and things were done
[37:51] give me holy also this power that on
[37:53] whomsoever I lay hands he may receive
[37:56] the Holy Ghost
[37:58] now what he was after
[38:00] was not taking people to the source of
[38:02] the power but he was after taking people
[38:05] to his own to his own Doctrine
[38:08] oh my that's why it's so important that
[38:11] when you're after the power of God to
[38:14] find somebody who knows what they're
[38:16] talking about
[38:18] that know that has been in touch with
[38:20] God it has a personal relationship and
[38:22] it's not just talking about just kind of
[38:25] some things that they mud up and made up
[38:27] in their mind or turn it into a
[38:29] psychology turning it into something
[38:30] like well I don't know whether brother
[38:33] Branham was right when he talked about
[38:34] the the Daniel 70 weeks or I don't know
[38:37] if he was right about this and that but
[38:38] I I believe that that through the power
[38:41] of God he has made a way for us to know
[38:44] he has made a way for us to be sure that
[38:47] what we believe is the truth he has made
[38:49] a way for us to be absolutely steadfast
[38:52] with with this message
[38:56] and the opposite now the opposite of
[38:58] Simon the Sorcerer now was Peter
[39:01] standing there who had been in touch
[39:03] with the source of the power and he said
[39:05] you know they told Simon the Sorcerer
[39:08] they when it went before he got in touch
[39:11] with with Peter and everybody they said
[39:13] this man is the great power of God this
[39:17] man I I think he's I think he's got
[39:20] something through his through his uh
[39:23] things that he was he was doing and his
[39:26] uh little tricks that he played and
[39:28] different things and
[39:30] but we're interested in the real power
[39:33] from God
[39:39] power from God
[39:42] so how do we get it
[39:45] how do we get God's power how do we get
[39:48] access to the power of God
[39:51] right now think about that
[39:53] the ocean rolling rolling waves of the
[39:56] ocean and there was remember that little
[39:58] story of the little boy in Holland you
[40:00] know I I believe that I'm correcting my
[40:02] facts that Holland is completely
[40:04] surrounded by the ocean and over time
[40:06] the land is sunk and sunk until they had
[40:09] to build these Dice and there was a
[40:11] little boy that the crack developed in
[40:13] one of the dikes and he stuck his finger
[40:15] in it to keep the the power of the ocean
[40:17] from flooding in but now in our case
[40:21] in my case I want the power of God to
[40:25] float in I want the power that's behind
[40:28] that dike to flooding and and just
[40:30] overtake my being
[40:32] that's got to happen one day it's got to
[40:34] happen to take you if you want to do
[40:38] something sometimes my wife and I will
[40:40] get every once in a while we we took we
[40:42] took the table and just put in third
[40:44] pool and went through all the quotes my
[40:47] we just about had a Revival if you want
[40:49] to put in uh
[40:53] uh it just slipped my mind what I was
[40:55] going to say
[40:56] well
[41:01] maybe I shouldn't went well that's let's
[41:04] just go on
[41:07] but um anyway that's a good thing to do
[41:09] sometimes is to put in
[41:12] yeah it's made it made it available for
[41:14] us that we've got all the messages at
[41:16] our fingertips I believe we should take
[41:18] advantage of that and sometimes you can
[41:20] have if you just kind of uh maybe you
[41:23] don't even have to have an emotional
[41:24] sometimes just kind of pull up the
[41:25] quotes and just go through them let's
[41:27] see what brother Brandon said about this
[41:28] I wonder what he said about the power of
[41:31] God and and just put in something that
[41:33] you find interesting maybe find out what
[41:35] brother Branham had to say for and you
[41:37] might be surprised it might be a little
[41:39] different than what you thought before
[41:41] I've had that own experience myself many
[41:43] times
[41:45] but but to to get access to that power
[41:49] of God there's got to be something to
[41:51] free up to free up that hole that the
[41:54] little boy had his hand plugged in just
[41:55] to make an illustration something to
[41:58] there's got to be something blocking us
[42:01] keeping us from getting access to the
[42:04] power of God and I want that whole the
[42:06] whole force of the ocean of God the
[42:08] whole force of it ocean of God's love to
[42:10] just flood in and take everything over
[42:12] but now
[42:14] what's stopping that is I believe is our
[42:18] unbelief and I've got some quotes here
[42:20] that I'll read in a little bit but now
[42:22] you know brother random talked about in
[42:24] in the greatest battle ever fought and
[42:25] many messages about how that your your
[42:28] flus are stopped up
[42:30] hey you know what your flus are is you
[42:32] remember something some preacher said
[42:36] and you remember something you did bad
[42:38] years ago you imagined in your in your
[42:42] mind that something should be some way
[42:44] or you imagine that the preacher don't
[42:46] like you or you imagine that somebody
[42:48] didn't shake your hand so they don't
[42:50] like you very much and you know it just
[42:52] blocks off that Dyke and the power of
[42:55] God can't rush through because there's
[42:58] something in the way and you've got to
[43:00] get those things free you know one of
[43:03] the other flu is your reason you got you
[43:05] got your own idea about how everything
[43:07] should work my goodness isn't that a big
[43:10] that's that's a huge thing just
[43:13] the reasoning that we should keep the
[43:16] message a secret isn't that something
[43:18] now reasoning that that you know there's
[43:21] some people out there that aren't
[43:23] predestinated here it's the way they
[43:25] talk and therefore we should keep it a
[43:27] secret I I remember my dad years ago
[43:29] talking about when he came into the
[43:31] message he was walking down the street
[43:32] with his brother and he saw somebody on
[43:34] the other side of the road and the
[43:35] brother didn't say hello to him and he
[43:38] said well why didn't you speak my dad
[43:40] said why didn't you speak to that to
[43:41] that brother and he said oh well he
[43:43] ain't a believer I'm not going to talk
[43:45] to somebody like that it just you know
[43:49] you got these flues blocked up if I was
[43:51] a reasoning in your mind and you you
[43:53] don't want to if you let the power of
[43:56] God come in and let God reveal it to you
[43:58] it'll blast that flu out and the power
[44:02] of God can just rush right in and take
[44:04] the place over and that's that's what I
[44:06] believe we're all struggling for and
[44:08] we're struggling through this life we're
[44:10] struggling as well we come to church
[44:12] we're coming to church and we pray and
[44:14] we read our Bible so that God can blast
[44:16] out the flus so he can fill us up and
[44:19] take us over take over our beat does
[44:20] that do you understand oh God I want you
[44:22] to understand
[44:24] he's trying to he's trying to fill us up
[44:27] with his goodness that's that the sister
[44:29] Shepherd's dream the holy spirit is
[44:31] washing everything out all the all the
[44:33] stuff all the flus everything just wash
[44:36] it all out until there's nothing left
[44:38] but his goodness that's that's what I
[44:40] want
[44:42] your Consciousness and your affection
[44:44] God through the power of His word can
[44:47] change your affection from the thing the
[44:48] affection of the things of this world to
[44:50] the things of God change your habits
[44:52] change your thoughts change the whole
[44:55] thing change your reads and get change
[44:56] your cautious change your imagination
[44:58] he'll change it all to conform to the
[45:01] word he does it by the revealing of the
[45:04] word he does it by the opening of the
[45:06] word and that's what now I'm going to
[45:09] change the direction here a little bit
[45:11] because that's what I believe in the Old
[45:13] Testament that God all down through the
[45:15] Old Testament and the new that God was
[45:17] looking for somebody
[45:19] through who he can open a conduit to
[45:22] reveal his word
[45:24] you know God is we're talking about
[45:26] revealing of the word we're talking
[45:27] about understanding and how you should
[45:29] find somebody that can open it to you
[45:32] because God the way he reveals it is
[45:35] through
[45:35] understanding is very important because
[45:38] he he does it through communicate
[45:40] communication is so important to God
[45:42] that he he wants it to convey to us
[45:46] what's written in his word and
[45:48] communicated to us is so important that
[45:50] in John it says in the beginning was the
[45:53] word
[45:57] because he's expressing himself he wants
[46:01] to express himself so that we'll catch
[46:03] the vision
[46:04] and the power of God that that the
[46:07] spirit can come and Quicken the vision
[46:08] Quicken the mechanics and make bring it
[46:10] to life and cause the power of God to be
[46:13] made manifest in US
[46:15] uh
[46:16] I believe understanding is so important
[46:18] you know that's one question I I I
[46:22] every time I finish preaching I like to
[46:25] go home and ask my wife because I think
[46:28] she's maybe one of the hold on now
[46:31] she's one of the few people that will
[46:33] answer this question accurately did you
[46:36] understand what I said now I'm not
[46:39] asking I'm not asking my wife did I
[46:41] preach the truth
[46:42] I might ask brother Wayne brother Dale
[46:45] their opinion for that obviously but now
[46:49] I want to know did you understand it
[46:52] because if you don't understand it then
[46:54] how can it be quickened and I believe
[46:56] that the Holy Spirit can come in
[46:58] quickening to us but you know there
[47:00] there should be even even you know the
[47:02] first time I read the seals and and
[47:03] things I thought I understood it and it
[47:06] keeps it just keeps magnifying and
[47:08] magnifying it if you're if you're at a
[47:10] place where you just it's just
[47:11] completely lost to you then just hold on
[47:14] and keep studying and keep keep reading
[47:17] and and after a while it'll begin to
[47:20] everything will begin to click and just
[47:22] keep rolling on
[47:23] but now God wants God is searching and I
[47:27] believe he's searching over this
[47:28] congregation tonight to find somebody
[47:31] through who he can unveil himself reveal
[47:34] his power in you that's that's his great
[47:38] plan and purpose in him
[47:40] Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[47:43] revealed in US Colossians 1 26 27.
[47:47] so now
[47:50] let me go over to
[47:53] first Samuel
[47:56] I'm just kind of going to flip through
[47:58] this y'all can fall on if you want
[48:01] but I'm going to kind of read some of
[48:03] these scriptures
[48:09] because at first Samuel chapter 15.
[48:13] we'll find out that a man named Saul
[48:16] King Saul
[48:18] failed at the task he had been given
[48:21] and why did he fail
[48:23] now the whole point the whole with all
[48:27] the way to get in touch with God the way
[48:30] to get hooked into God Is by Revelation
[48:33] when God reveals something to you well
[48:36] even if it's not revealed if God says
[48:38] something if God says something in his
[48:41] word then you have to do it you have to
[48:44] stay perfectly lined up with that word
[48:46] you know Cain
[48:49] Abel we say Abel had a revelation McCain
[48:51] knew after just observing just sitting
[48:54] around and watching he saw the Firefall
[48:56] and consume able sacrifice well then it
[48:58] was plain as day what needed to be done
[49:01] and as plain as day even without a
[49:03] revelation you can you can just kind of
[49:05] observe what people do and see how
[49:08] people are coming into fellowship with
[49:10] God you can just observe why won't you
[49:13] come down I remember Charles Perkins
[49:15] talked about this man in his
[49:16] congregation that he tried to get to see
[49:18] that he needed to be baptized and he
[49:20] told him over and over you need to be
[49:22] baptized and come to the Lord and
[49:24] finally he said I see that I need to be
[49:26] baptized and Charles Persian said well
[49:28] when would you like to do it he well and
[49:30] he kept delaying and he kept delaying
[49:32] and he would not do it now that's a
[49:35] dangerous place to be when you see that
[49:37] you need to do something but yet you
[49:39] won't do it it's one thing to not
[49:40] understand but when you have a
[49:42] revelation when you see it it won't do
[49:44] it now that was Kane's problem is he saw
[49:47] what to do and would not do it and now
[49:51] I mean came but now Saul also is what
[49:55] we're looking at here Saul was told by
[49:58] the prophet of God exactly what to do to
[50:01] go swap out all the amalekais go kill
[50:04] everything they had to just destroy it
[50:06] all but he said well I got a better way
[50:08] of doing it and the way that seemeth
[50:10] right to a man is a way of Destruction a
[50:13] lot of times and
[50:17] Saul failed to stay perfectly in line
[50:19] with God's word and because he did that
[50:22] he closed up the conduit of God's power
[50:25] in his life he could have been a great
[50:26] king maybe he could have been somebody
[50:28] that that maybe the songs and things
[50:31] that were sung about David would have
[50:33] been sung about Saul if he would have
[50:34] just stayed with God's word but he
[50:36] failed to do that and so the Gate of
[50:39] God's blessings was closed
[50:41] because it says you know the the Holy
[50:43] Spirit the spirit went from Saul to
[50:46] David and and so
[50:50] so in in first Samuel chapter 15 we read
[50:52] about how the whole story of how Samuel
[50:55] came to him and said obedience is better
[50:58] than sacrifice and and what's this
[51:00] bleeding of the sheep in my ears and the
[51:02] lowering of the oxygen which I hear
[51:03] what's what what's going on and maybe we
[51:07] could say that today about some things
[51:08] that are going on in the message what's
[51:09] this bleeding of the sheep the bleeding
[51:11] of the sheep that I hear that the people
[51:13] that that thought they could go run
[51:15] under the wings of their their Pastor or
[51:18] whatever now the pastor's turning on
[51:20] them and things what's this bleeding of
[51:21] the sheep you're done exactly what
[51:23] shouldn't have been done exactly what
[51:25] God
[51:27] exactly against the scripture and so the
[51:30] conduit of God's power has been closed
[51:32] but now how is it open
[51:34] and I believe that God was searching
[51:37] and the way he searches
[51:40] because God told first Samuel that the
[51:42] way he chose a king was by looking at
[51:45] the heart
[51:46] because it says he said I'm not he told
[51:49] Samuel I'm not like men I'm not like
[51:51] just you're you know anybody else and I
[51:53] don't just look at the outside
[51:55] appearance I don't look at your uh the
[51:57] smiling like you're on a children's show
[51:59] like I was talking about just acting
[52:00] real chipper and and appearances can be
[52:03] so deceiving and that's why let me just
[52:06] throw this out all the young people
[52:07] before you choose a husband or a wife
[52:09] you better make sure that you pray
[52:12] because appearances can be so deceiving
[52:14] it look it'll look fine on the outside
[52:17] but then after you've been married six
[52:19] months or a year and all of a sudden
[52:20] then that thing that's on the inside
[52:22] comes out and I heard somebody say that
[52:25] you know if you marry somebody that's
[52:27] not filled with the Holy Ghost then the
[52:29] devil is your father-in-law
[52:34] and that's uh I I believe many should
[52:40] prayerfully consider that most important
[52:42] decision in your life because it can
[52:45] have an impact
[52:46] yeah and not just that but you know
[52:49] appearances appearance of of ministers
[52:51] in the messages what church you go to
[52:53] the parents and it just I'm going to be
[52:57] honest it Grieves me a lot of times to
[52:59] see what people are attracted to
[53:00] attracted to simpering and smiling and
[53:03] cheerfulness and and more attracted to
[53:05] the songs that are sung the the way that
[53:08] the song Services held and led then the
[53:10] preaching behind the pulpit because I'm
[53:12] gonna tell you that the way to open up
[53:14] the conduit to God is Not By the songs
[53:16] or the the uh the The Smiling preacher
[53:20] but it's through the truth being
[53:21] preached and it being revealed to you
[53:23] and you taking that Revelation and
[53:25] running with it that is what opens up
[53:28] the power of God to you so God was
[53:31] looking for somebody to make himself
[53:32] manifest in make looking for somebody
[53:35] that he can make his power manifest in
[53:37] and you know brother Brandon said about
[53:39] this uh this about David before Samuel
[53:41] even came to him that David already had
[53:45] a relationship with God he knew who he
[53:47] was serving he knew about God and he
[53:50] began all these songs and things that
[53:52] were written about David
[53:54] uh I had
[53:57] I had some things written
[53:59] but I can't find them so I'm gonna just
[54:02] go on
[54:03] but Saul failed because of unbelief and
[54:06] look where
[54:08] so look where Samuel
[54:12] let's read and uh chapter 16.
[54:17] verse 12 and he sent
[54:20] see Samuel this is what I love
[54:23] God is so uh past finding out in the
[54:27] normal way of looking at things the
[54:29] normal way you would be to let's find
[54:30] the greatest the tallest statute person
[54:32] the the biggest the finest looking
[54:34] gentleman and and we'll make him the
[54:36] king
[54:37] which is what Israel was looking for but
[54:40] God doesn't do things the way we do and
[54:42] that's something that we should all
[54:43] consider before making decisions is God
[54:46] might want you to have this other job
[54:47] over here that didn't look right uh it
[54:50] doesn't seem maybe to pay the most money
[54:51] or whatever he might want you to marry
[54:54] the girl that looks a little bit more
[54:57] homely than some
[55:00] that's that's the truth it's the truth
[55:03] because God wants you to be happy and to
[55:06] be happy he's looking on the inside at
[55:07] somebody that there's a beauty that's
[55:09] more the beauty on the inside that's
[55:11] greater than anything on the outside
[55:13] that's that's the gospel truth that's
[55:16] what I'm telling you is the truth I
[55:17] believe it
[55:18] and he sent and brought him in now so
[55:21] they Samuel was confused about who he
[55:24] should anointed be king and all the
[55:26] seven paraded in front of him and he
[55:28] looked at each one and this isn't it
[55:30] because Samuel was waiting on the Lord
[55:32] to tell him who should be anointed king
[55:34] and and he brought in a little tiny
[55:37] fella you know what brother Randolph
[55:38] said that Jesus was small like five foot
[55:40] six or so or a short little fella and
[55:42] David was short and look at all these
[55:45] Great Mighty Men in the Bible who are
[55:47] not great in stature not big like Samson
[55:50] who the movies portray as being this
[55:52] great Hulk there's a we always laugh at
[55:55] this calendar in the back who's got Sam
[55:57] some pictures like this great big huge
[55:59] bulgy muscles but brother random said he
[56:01] wasn't like that at all thank God for a
[56:03] prophet to tell us these things so that
[56:05] we'll know we can understand God's
[56:07] design and how God works and begin to
[56:10] see how the the the continuity of the
[56:13] scriptures was put together that God
[56:15] could take a little shrimp and make them
[56:17] into a great big powerful man that could
[56:19] take a general ball of a donkey and kill
[56:21] a thousand Philistines he can take a
[56:24] little David and and uh somebody that's
[56:27] just a little scrawny runt and do Great
[56:30] and Mighty works and so they write songs
[56:32] about it and you know you can look back
[56:35] at and the history of the people in the
[56:38] Bible and see see how they're typing
[56:40] Christ and see how they're living the
[56:42] word now and this is in the Old
[56:45] Testament without the baptism the Holy
[56:47] Ghost what should we be today we should
[56:49] be so full of the power oh my I I got
[56:52] some quotes that I think will really
[56:54] bless you in a minute that we'll look at
[56:56] that just a little so say God showed
[56:59] same of this little this little runt of
[57:01] a fella and said this is him this is the
[57:04] one that I want you to anoint
[57:06] and
[57:07] so the then Samo took the Horn of oil
[57:10] and anointed him in the midst of his
[57:12] Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came
[57:13] Upon David from that day forward so
[57:15] Samuel rose up and went went to Rama
[57:19] so God was looking for someone that
[57:21] could that he could release the power of
[57:24] God into and now Samuel had a revelation
[57:28] of who that man should be
[57:30] exactly Samuel the messenger had a
[57:33] revelation but you know what
[57:36] David needed a revelation too
[57:39] and you know I believe when David got
[57:41] that Revelation that the power of God
[57:44] began to flow through him because when
[57:46] David realized that he was going to be
[57:49] king
[57:50] and he wasn't king yet
[57:52] that my he could do you know he made
[57:55] this confession he made it he told Saul
[57:58] when he met him he said there was a line
[58:00] came through and a bear came through but
[58:03] it didn't matter the lion came through
[58:05] and he took took hold of one of the
[58:07] sheep and and took him in his mouth but
[58:09] I went and grabbed it and grabbed it by
[58:10] the beard my you know we were talking to
[58:13] Brother Anderson about how the in the
[58:15] Africa today they as a riot of Passage a
[58:18] lot of these young men will have to or
[58:20] they used to I don't know if they still
[58:21] do but they used to take a spear and
[58:23] have to go kill a lion
[58:24] that's with a spear yeah but now David
[58:27] got face to face with it and grabbed it
[58:30] by the beard because he knew he had a
[58:33] revelation that God was with him that
[58:35] the power of God was with him and upon
[58:37] him that he was anointed to fulfill a
[58:39] purpose for his life and you know
[58:42] brother Brandon said when the bride
[58:43] begins to realize who she is and what
[58:46] she's here for she will be an invincible
[58:49] Army
[58:50] now see how important Revelation is so
[58:53] that Revelation opens up the conduit for
[58:56] God to begin working through you because
[58:58] when there's something holding back to
[59:00] Dyke then at the little Holland diet
[59:02] we're talking about then that power of
[59:05] God can't can't get it all the way in
[59:07] there's there's little things in your
[59:08] life that little things but but when
[59:10] David realized who he was and what God
[59:12] was doing boom just the power of God
[59:15] just rush in what could prevent it then
[59:17] when God when David believed God's word
[59:20] he believed what Samuel had prophesied
[59:23] over him he believed that he would come
[59:24] to pass you know David was anointed
[59:27] three times he's anointed once by same
[59:30] you know he was anointed once by the men
[59:31] of Judah the following and he was
[59:33] anointed once by the the whole country
[59:36] and just like you know one day you get
[59:38] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then
[59:40] you get another fulfilling When You
[59:42] Reach adoption but then one day a super
[59:44] knowing is going to come and take us in
[59:46] the Rapture it's going to fill every
[59:48] fiber of our being and take us into
[59:49] Rapture a shout voice Trump all the uh
[59:54] it's just beautiful the continuity of
[59:56] the scripture we could see how
[59:57] everything just fits perfectly together
[59:59] yeah
[1:00:01] now but now
[1:00:03] David just trusted the Lord and here's
[1:00:08] that here's that little scripture I was
[1:00:09] looking for
[1:00:10] he wrote this uh this song truly my soul
[1:00:14] waiteth upon God from him cometh my
[1:00:16] salvation he only is my rock and my
[1:00:19] salvation he is my defense I shall not
[1:00:23] be greatly moved you think about all the
[1:00:25] things that David endured in life as he
[1:00:27] was walking up that hill or rejected
[1:00:28] King and being sped on and things
[1:00:30] talking about and but he had a song in
[1:00:32] his heart and you know right after he
[1:00:35] was chosen what did he do right after he
[1:00:37] was anointed what did he do he was sent
[1:00:40] down to Saul and he began to cast out
[1:00:41] devils
[1:00:42] he played on his heart he played on his
[1:00:45] harp and you know I I was reading about
[1:00:47] somebody that was that kind of described
[1:00:49] it this way that how did David play his
[1:00:52] heart now you could play uh you just he
[1:00:55] played he he instead of playing his own
[1:00:58] song somebody said it just kind of
[1:01:00] poetic like that he was playing the harp
[1:01:02] song about how it was cut down and and
[1:01:05] turned into this harp and when he began
[1:01:07] to play the harp song instead of his
[1:01:09] song then it caused this evil spirit to
[1:01:11] leave David it's just kind of a little
[1:01:13] poetic thing that you know that's kind
[1:01:16] of how you know when you preach I could
[1:01:19] tell my own message but I'd rather Play
[1:01:21] Jesus song I'd rather tell about how he
[1:01:24] tells sing his message as a way to say
[1:01:27] it but now David said this song he only
[1:01:29] is my rock and my salvation and you know
[1:01:32] what brother Branham said about my rock
[1:01:33] my rock is rock is revelation and David
[1:01:37] had a revelation and God knew I believe
[1:01:40] that God knew that he would receive the
[1:01:42] revelation of who he was and what his
[1:01:45] purpose in life was and would obey it to
[1:01:47] the letter and keep it and that is why
[1:01:50] he was selected he said David is a man
[1:01:52] after my own heart
[1:01:54] and I believe that we all want to be
[1:01:56] after God's Own Heart and the way to be
[1:01:58] after God's Own Heart Is to take him at
[1:02:00] his word and stay right with it if you
[1:02:03] don't understand it stay with it anyhow
[1:02:05] until you do understand it because that
[1:02:08] is how you open up the conduit to the
[1:02:10] power of God open up the Gateway
[1:02:13] and so David's saying the song not a
[1:02:17] loving kindness is better than life that
[1:02:19] we know brother Brandon preached about
[1:02:20] and he had something
[1:02:23] after he was he had gone through these
[1:02:25] trials of life after he had an
[1:02:28] experience with God
[1:02:29] he could go down to Saul and play on the
[1:02:31] heart because he had something to sing
[1:02:34] about he had his own song he had a song
[1:02:37] in his heart he had something and I
[1:02:39] believe the power of God could put a
[1:02:41] fire in your belly a spring in your step
[1:02:43] and a song in your heart and it just
[1:02:45] makes you live a life it's more joyous
[1:02:47] than anything we should be the most
[1:02:49] happiest the most joyful people that
[1:02:50] should be a song with everybody's heart
[1:02:52] because of the joy of the Lord the
[1:02:54] sinners
[1:02:56] and but that song in his heart made him
[1:02:59] an outcast
[1:03:01] now the next little thing I want to talk
[1:03:02] about is
[1:03:04] isn't Davis that next little piece in
[1:03:06] David during in David's Journey
[1:03:09] and the next little piece is when he
[1:03:10] went up to Saul and he made this
[1:03:12] confession that I've killed The Lion and
[1:03:14] the Bear
[1:03:16] you know when Samuel found him he was
[1:03:17] taking care of the Sheep
[1:03:19] he was not you know taken care of
[1:03:23] uh he was taken care of
[1:03:25] of what God had given him in life to
[1:03:29] take care of
[1:03:30] I believe if we'll be diligent to take
[1:03:32] care of what God has given us you know
[1:03:34] and this song was Solomon it says
[1:03:35] there's a little piece in there about
[1:03:37] taking care of your own Vineyard
[1:03:39] and you know you can take care of
[1:03:41] everybody else's Vineyards what
[1:03:42] everybody else thinks you should do what
[1:03:44] what uh where they think you should go
[1:03:46] but so many times we neglect our own
[1:03:49] what God has given us in life and God
[1:03:51] has given you first of all a
[1:03:52] responsibility to take care of your
[1:03:54] relationship with God and you you've got
[1:03:57] to make time that's tending your
[1:03:58] Vineyard pruning it making sure
[1:04:00] everything's just in order so that when
[1:04:03] God looks upon you study to show thyself
[1:04:06] approved study be diligent that's not
[1:04:08] just studying but that's doing
[1:04:09] everything study is just kind of almost
[1:04:11] like an expression that involves it
[1:04:13] includes a lot of things including
[1:04:15] studying but prayer study uh doing
[1:04:17] things that that are all part of being a
[1:04:20] Christian to show thyself and prove who
[1:04:21] unto God not under your neighbor or
[1:04:24] anything but so study do everything that
[1:04:27] you can and that's what David was doing
[1:04:29] he was doing everything that he could to
[1:04:32] take care of what God had given him in
[1:04:34] his life and you might not be a pastor
[1:04:36] of a church or uh you know different
[1:04:39] things in in in in the Walk of Life but
[1:04:42] God has given you something whether it's
[1:04:44] to to teach your little children or or
[1:04:47] or or whatever and that's what David was
[1:04:49] attending to and that's how Samuel found
[1:04:51] him
[1:04:53] and he was keeping keeping the sheep and
[1:04:57] what happened was a lion
[1:04:59] and a bear came along and he said that
[1:05:01] he rescued the sheep from his mouth
[1:05:04] he rescued the sheep from his mouth now
[1:05:07] I think mouth has something interesting
[1:05:09] in scripture because in Song of Solomon
[1:05:12] the very first verse is that the bride
[1:05:15] desires the kisses of his mouth
[1:05:17] and you know God spoke to Moses
[1:05:20] mouth to mouth he put his words and his
[1:05:24] thought into Moses mouth when you desire
[1:05:26] the kisses of God's mouth you're
[1:05:28] Desiring the personal a personal
[1:05:30] relationship a personal revelation God
[1:05:32] showing you his secret things I believe
[1:05:35] that's that's you know sometimes we look
[1:05:38] at that Song of Solomon said I've been
[1:05:40] studying on that and it's such a
[1:05:41] beautiful book when it begins to open to
[1:05:43] you and you know I've heard many people
[1:05:45] almost kind of make fun of that book as
[1:05:47] being wow
[1:05:49] almost like naughty and things but
[1:05:52] there's nothing naughty about that book
[1:05:53] I'm telling you the truth about that
[1:05:55] there's nothing there's something secret
[1:05:57] and something mysterious and something
[1:05:59] glorious about that book when you see
[1:06:01] the desire of the kisses of his mouth
[1:06:03] something when you get in your secret
[1:06:05] place and he he gives you the kisses of
[1:06:07] his mouth and the word begins to unfold
[1:06:09] you and you realize what's in the Bible
[1:06:11] you realize that what it is talking
[1:06:13] about the promises that are so special
[1:06:16] to you and the power of God begins to
[1:06:18] unfold in your life and Quicken Quicken
[1:06:21] the mechanics
[1:06:22] and so he rescued the sheep from the
[1:06:25] mouth and I believe that's what's
[1:06:27] happening today is is that there's lines
[1:06:30] and bears and things in the message in
[1:06:33] the denominational world in the church
[1:06:35] world that are taking the sheep and
[1:06:37] trying to steal them away but there is a
[1:06:40] man that could turn on the light and
[1:06:42] steal back those little sheep from the
[1:06:43] mouth that's trying to take him to pray
[1:06:45] and I believe that God sends people
[1:06:48] sends men that are not cowards but are
[1:06:50] men that will tell the truth and tell it
[1:06:52] like it is to rescue to grab that line
[1:06:54] by the beard and stare it in the face
[1:06:57] and say that you're not going to take
[1:06:58] that sheep and to say to him for anybody
[1:07:01] to say that I know the secret of God's
[1:07:03] power and to withhold it my my what what
[1:07:07] a judgment
[1:07:09] I just would hate to be in somebody's
[1:07:11] shoes like that to know the secret of
[1:07:13] the revelation of of the power of God
[1:07:16] and to withhold it and keep it back keep
[1:07:18] it a secret you know one time I was
[1:07:21] talking when I was preaching here I was
[1:07:22] talking about in early church age there
[1:07:23] was this little group called The
[1:07:24] gnostics
[1:07:25] and they wanted they they believed that
[1:07:28] they had all this Revelation but they
[1:07:30] wanted to keep a secret they would keep
[1:07:32] it secret unless you got up into the
[1:07:34] higher echelons and then they would kind
[1:07:36] of drop little nuggets as you got
[1:07:37] further up but now this is a gospel that
[1:07:40] that is proclaimed openly Jesus said
[1:07:43] Jesus told the fair season what not he
[1:07:45] told them I I've spoke openly if you
[1:07:47] want to know what I believed and ask the
[1:07:49] people that follow me I didn't tell in a
[1:07:52] secret place but I just shared it openly
[1:07:54] shared it on the Internet or wherever if
[1:07:56] there's somebody else that's if there's
[1:07:58] somebody that's preaching it I believe
[1:08:00] that somebody will that if you really
[1:08:02] have a desire to hear it you'll find it
[1:08:04] and and there's a way God has made a way
[1:08:08] uh I'm convinced of that I'm sharing you
[1:08:11] the things that I'm convinced of
[1:08:15] so
[1:08:17] you know the the only way Satan can hold
[1:08:20] you
[1:08:21] it's kind of what I'm getting at
[1:08:23] the only way Satan can hold you is by
[1:08:26] your unbelief
[1:08:27] and down through scripture you can see
[1:08:29] how the men men that could have been
[1:08:31] liberated could have been free for the
[1:08:34] power of God to be free in their life
[1:08:35] they were held captive by their unbelief
[1:08:38] and if they would have just took God at
[1:08:41] his word until it was revealed to them
[1:08:43] then they would been
[1:08:45] free and and could walk in the liberty
[1:08:47] of of God
[1:08:50] I look at look at what David when he
[1:08:53] battled that line of the bear
[1:08:55] and I don't believe when that line of
[1:08:57] that bear came up that he thought well
[1:08:58] hold on a second I got to pray a little
[1:09:00] bit that's kind of like when you're
[1:09:01] taking Taekwondo or whatever they tell
[1:09:03] you when out when when uh when you get
[1:09:05] in a real fight you're not going to have
[1:09:07] a chance to limber up hold on a second
[1:09:10] let me stretch it a little bit
[1:09:12] you know
[1:09:14] brother random said when uh uh when
[1:09:17] Joshua stopped the moon and the son he
[1:09:20] was prayed up before the foundation of
[1:09:21] the world why is that because that power
[1:09:24] of God that was in him was prayed up
[1:09:26] before the foundation of the world God
[1:09:27] don't need no preparation time he don't
[1:09:29] need any help he's that power of God is
[1:09:32] coursing through he said I'll give you
[1:09:33] Living Waters I'll give you a Wellspring
[1:09:35] of everlasting life without Wellspring
[1:09:37] of everlasting life don't need no
[1:09:38] preparation time it's ready it's always
[1:09:41] ready it's instant now in and out of
[1:09:43] season it's ready to face any challenge
[1:09:45] anytime anywhere you grab that line by
[1:09:48] the beard and and say come on
[1:09:50] and because you know if you've got the
[1:09:53] power of God in your life it's not you
[1:09:54] anymore but it's God fighting your
[1:09:57] battles and he said I'll never leave you
[1:09:58] or forsake you I'll always be with you
[1:10:00] and that's one of the things you know
[1:10:03] that you God won't leave you you have to
[1:10:07] leave him you could see that being
[1:10:09] carried out acted out today is that God
[1:10:12] God doesn't leave people they turn away
[1:10:15] and leave him isn't that some that
[1:10:17] picture of Jesus knocking on the door
[1:10:19] with it with a doorknob
[1:10:21] missing or whatever because the
[1:10:24] doorknob's on the inside you got to open
[1:10:25] it up and Jesus standing there knocking
[1:10:28] at the door trying to get in and they
[1:10:30] won't let him come in because they don't
[1:10:31] they won't believe his word they won't
[1:10:34] believe the things that he talked about
[1:10:35] they won't believe that a messenger that
[1:10:38] can reveal these things knows what he's
[1:10:40] talking about we
[1:10:42] ought to be so grateful that we found
[1:10:43] somebody that knows what they're talking
[1:10:45] about
[1:10:49] now
[1:10:50] so he took foolishness of the Gospel he
[1:10:54] took his little slingshot and he tore
[1:10:56] that bear up he tore that line up until
[1:10:59] it ran away and he got a little
[1:11:02] testimony
[1:11:03] and over time over your life you begin
[1:11:06] to accrue these little testimonies
[1:11:08] begin to accrue them until
[1:11:10] you grow more and more closer to God you
[1:11:13] begin to realize that God's word is true
[1:11:16] that he really will answer prayer that
[1:11:19] you begin to as you read the scripture
[1:11:21] and you say my goodness I didn't realize
[1:11:23] that that promise was there I didn't
[1:11:24] realize that promise was for me
[1:11:26] and you just draw closer and closer to
[1:11:28] him
[1:11:29] and it becomes more and more real
[1:11:31] and that's what David did as he came up
[1:11:34] to maybe one of the greatest challenges
[1:11:37] in his life
[1:11:38] was when he came up against the devil
[1:11:40] because that's what goliath types
[1:11:43] is the devil right
[1:11:50] we'll look at this first Samuel chapter
[1:11:52] 17.
[1:11:55] this is I I when I read this little
[1:11:58] story to my kids and I this is one story
[1:12:00] in the Bible
[1:12:01] this in Hebrews 11. that I can hardly
[1:12:04] read without crying because it just
[1:12:07] shows the power of God in action
[1:12:10] it shows God made manifest in somebody's
[1:12:12] life that will take him in his word it
[1:12:15] doesn't matter if you know now look at
[1:12:17] this story the whole everybody that
[1:12:19] should have been on David's side was
[1:12:21] against him
[1:12:22] everybody on the other side was against
[1:12:24] him but that didn't matter it doesn't
[1:12:25] matter if the whole world's against you
[1:12:27] if God's on your side
[1:12:28] and that's one thing that boggles me is
[1:12:31] that men and the message that are
[1:12:33] ministers that say that they're afraid
[1:12:36] that somebody will find out what they
[1:12:37] believe I don't care if the whole world
[1:12:40] is what I believe you know at my work
[1:12:42] they've been sending out uh this this
[1:12:44] the LGBT Pride stuff has been catching
[1:12:48] on and they send out these big
[1:12:49] newsletters with rainbows and stuff how
[1:12:50] they they've hijacked the rainbow and
[1:12:52] took that over and they're not ashamed
[1:12:53] of what they believe now we should how
[1:12:55] should we shouldn't be ashamed of what
[1:12:57] we believe
[1:12:58] because there's power in what we believe
[1:13:02] you shouldn't you shouldn't be ashamed
[1:13:04] of the Gospel you know the Believers
[1:13:06] have little things in their life that
[1:13:08] separate you when you get down at lunch
[1:13:11] and you bow your head over your meal
[1:13:12] that is a separation it separates you
[1:13:16] from the things of the world and
[1:13:18] everybody looks on that and sees that
[1:13:20] something is different about you
[1:13:21] somebody that respects God enough to put
[1:13:24] their head down over their meal it
[1:13:25] doesn't matter what anybody else thinks
[1:13:27] it doesn't matter what anybody else says
[1:13:29] but the power of God is living inside of
[1:13:32] you an example of light and so um
[1:13:37] in first Samuel chapter 17 the
[1:13:40] Philistines that gathered their armies
[1:13:42] to battle and were gathered together
[1:13:43] here show called which belongeth to
[1:13:44] Judah and pitched their tents
[1:13:47] and I'm just going to kind of skim down
[1:13:49] and and verse 3 and the Philistines
[1:13:51] stood on the mountain on the one side
[1:13:52] and Israel on the other side and there
[1:13:54] was a valley between him and they went
[1:13:56] out a champion out of the camp of the
[1:13:58] Philistines named Goliath
[1:14:00] nine and a half nine feet and seven feet
[1:14:03] nine feet seven inches tall
[1:14:05] great big old fella and you know he
[1:14:08] represents the devil
[1:14:10] you remember brother random talking
[1:14:11] about how uh
[1:14:15] that uh Vision he had of the the the the
[1:14:18] how the devil came up a great big old
[1:14:21] thing and and he began to boo it the
[1:14:23] devil got smaller smaller and it seemed
[1:14:25] like he got great big old huge muscles
[1:14:28] but brother Brandon don't have real big
[1:14:29] muscles and real didn't have big muscles
[1:14:31] in real life and David didn't either so
[1:14:34] where did he get those muscles he got
[1:14:36] those muscles by a revelation of the
[1:14:39] word of God because faith is a
[1:14:41] revelation he got them because he began
[1:14:43] to realize that it began to be convinced
[1:14:46] of the power that laid within him
[1:14:49] you know I think many times we struggle
[1:14:52] it to realize what is inside of us if we
[1:14:56] have the new birth if the person of
[1:14:58] Jesus Christ is inside of us
[1:15:02] I'm running out of time here but I I
[1:15:04] have some some quotes I'm going to share
[1:15:07] in just a minute so hang on with me
[1:15:10] about what where we should be about
[1:15:13] where we should be as as Christians and
[1:15:15] the Philistines stood on the mountain
[1:15:17] let me read down
[1:15:18] they went on a champion out of the camp
[1:15:21] another Philistines named Goliath of
[1:15:23] gath whose height was six cubits in the
[1:15:25] span and he had a helmet of brass and he
[1:15:27] describes all of my goodness so
[1:15:29] intimidating
[1:15:30] you can say well
[1:15:32] well they got all these people with llds
[1:15:34] and phds and all this kind of stuff and
[1:15:36] I I just love that little movie Luther
[1:15:40] about how Martin Luther got up in front
[1:15:42] of all those people with the phds and
[1:15:44] the llds and everything and he prayed
[1:15:46] all night before and he went up there
[1:15:48] and he went up there with boldly he
[1:15:51] grabbed that line by the beard and he
[1:15:53] looked it in the face and he told him
[1:15:55] how it was and he told him by the power
[1:15:57] of God the power of that the spirit of
[1:16:00] the lord gave him the words to say in
[1:16:02] that hour I'll give you the words to say
[1:16:04] and and he and he just he he God I
[1:16:08] believe God really likes men who are not
[1:16:12] cowards who will just men and women who
[1:16:15] will you know what a a coward in the
[1:16:17] gospel is somebody who looks at God's
[1:16:19] word and say I can't it ain't gonna work
[1:16:21] but if you just take it and just lean on
[1:16:24] it
[1:16:26] there's power in there there's power in
[1:16:29] leaning on his word on the gospel
[1:16:31] and the staff of this beer was like a
[1:16:33] Weaver's beam and his spirit's head
[1:16:35] weighed 600 shekels of iron and one
[1:16:37] bearing of Shield went before Oh my
[1:16:39] scary
[1:16:40] scary stuff
[1:16:42] but not to David
[1:16:44] and he stood and cried under the armies
[1:16:45] of Israel and said on them why are you
[1:16:47] come out to sit your battling array I'm
[1:16:48] not I Philistine and ye service to Saul
[1:16:51] choose you a man for you and let him
[1:16:53] come down to me
[1:16:54] and if he'd be able to fight with me and
[1:16:56] to kill me then will we be your service
[1:16:58] but if I Prevail against him and it goes
[1:17:00] on it now look nobody was willing to do
[1:17:04] that nobody was willing to accept the
[1:17:06] challenge because nobody had the
[1:17:07] Revelation that David had nobody knew
[1:17:11] the power of God
[1:17:14] that's something to think about
[1:17:15] David did
[1:17:17] David had the revelation
[1:17:20] and David was
[1:17:23] let's see let me skip down
[1:17:28] carry these 10 cheeses verse 18.
[1:17:31] and David Rose up early in the morning
[1:17:38] and all men of Israel fled when they saw
[1:17:40] him
[1:17:43] sorry I'm not as prepared as I maybe
[1:17:45] should have been
[1:17:46] and the people answered him after this
[1:17:48] man are saying so shall be done to the
[1:17:50] man that killeth him whoever kills
[1:17:52] Goliath gets a wife
[1:17:54] is one of the things isn't that
[1:17:56] beautiful
[1:17:57] and Jesus killed Goliath on the cross
[1:18:00] and as a reward he got a bride he
[1:18:03] redeemed the bride
[1:18:05] and now look here comes David with a
[1:18:07] confession of the power of God
[1:18:09] in verse 27 and the people said answered
[1:18:12] after this manager so shall it be done
[1:18:13] to the man that killeth him in a lab his
[1:18:15] oldest brother heard him when he's
[1:18:16] speaking of the men and his Elias anger
[1:18:18] was Kindle against David and he said why
[1:18:20] came us down hither and with whom as
[1:18:23] thou left those few sheep in the
[1:18:25] wilderness
[1:18:26] I knew that I pride and the naughtiness
[1:18:28] of thine heart
[1:18:30] for thou art come down that thou might
[1:18:31] have see the battle
[1:18:34] see it's like you try to do something
[1:18:36] good and you always have somebody
[1:18:38] opposing you but that didn't matter to
[1:18:40] David David David just forged right
[1:18:42] ahead and when the words were heard
[1:18:44] which David Spade verse 31 they
[1:18:46] rehearsed him before Saul and he sent
[1:18:48] for him and David said to Saul let no
[1:18:50] man's heart fail because of him thy
[1:18:52] servant will go and fight with this
[1:18:54] philistine
[1:18:56] and that's really what I'm trying to get
[1:18:57] across today let no man's heart fail
[1:19:00] because there is a man here that can
[1:19:01] turn on the light there is a man here
[1:19:03] that can reveal the secrets the
[1:19:06] Mysteries the Hidden Mysteries and when
[1:19:07] he reveals it to you it'll bring power
[1:19:09] to your life
[1:19:11] power this light was it it was with
[1:19:13] David and David did not have the Holy
[1:19:15] Ghost
[1:19:16] no that's right now that's quite a
[1:19:18] revelation today I I I I used to be a
[1:19:20] little bit naive in the message about
[1:19:22] some of these things but I'm realizing
[1:19:24] how odd that is to believe that
[1:19:28] that I went out after him and smote him
[1:19:30] and he's talking about the lion and the
[1:19:32] bear and I servant salute both The Lion
[1:19:33] and the bear and this uncircumcised
[1:19:35] Philistine shall be as one of them
[1:19:36] seeing you have to fire the armies of
[1:19:38] the Living God
[1:19:40] that's a confession
[1:19:42] when you can make a confession look for
[1:19:44] like that about all the little problems
[1:19:46] in your life from your stub toe to
[1:19:49] whatever to your children coming back to
[1:19:51] the Lord to whatever it is this
[1:19:53] Philistine is going to be subject to the
[1:19:56] power of God
[1:19:57] 's gonna have his way with this problem
[1:20:01] and Saul armed David with his armor and
[1:20:04] he tried that's that's where my see if
[1:20:08] David would have fell into that trap of
[1:20:10] being of moving into the the doctrines
[1:20:13] and things that Saul had Saul's way
[1:20:16] in other words what Saul was doing is I
[1:20:19] you know I heard your confession about
[1:20:21] the lion and the bear but I'm not quite
[1:20:23] convinced and he wasn't quite convinced
[1:20:25] because he didn't have a revelation of
[1:20:27] that himself but David did and he wasn't
[1:20:30] convinced in these doctrines of man and
[1:20:32] things that that will cover up the holes
[1:20:35] in the dike that will seek keep the the
[1:20:38] power of the ocean from flooding in he
[1:20:41] wasn't convinced that but he was
[1:20:42] convinced that if he put his trust in
[1:20:45] God if he put his trust in the word it
[1:20:47] everything would be all right and so
[1:20:49] that's what he you know brother I'm
[1:20:51] talking about it you get your little
[1:20:52] will of Faith turning with the power of
[1:20:54] God
[1:20:55] you get everything lined up that's right
[1:20:57] if you if your faith matches what's in
[1:20:59] the Bible then something's got to happen
[1:21:02] something has got to happen if if your
[1:21:05] motives and objectives are lined up with
[1:21:07] what is already written in the Bible
[1:21:09] there's nothing that can stop it it's
[1:21:10] like a freight train a freight train of
[1:21:13] God's word that cannot be stopped now
[1:21:16] David put his faith in these five little
[1:21:18] stones j-e-s-u-s and he he wrapped him
[1:21:21] in his five fingers f-a-i-t-h and he
[1:21:24] went to meet Goliath and he said where
[1:21:26] all that stung over his head and that
[1:21:27] stone struck Goliath and
[1:21:30] didn't matter that there was a helmet on
[1:21:32] his head
[1:21:33] but the power of God took took Goliath
[1:21:36] out and and knocked him down
[1:21:38] the power of God manifested looks Mighty
[1:21:40] strange
[1:21:41] because David was a little scrawny runt
[1:21:44] Jesus was looked like he had no power
[1:21:47] when he was down on the cross but that
[1:21:48] was more power right there than maybe
[1:21:50] the world had ever seen
[1:21:52] you know I heard this story about
[1:21:54] polycarp praying fervently when it came
[1:21:55] to take him away to to be to be burned
[1:21:58] to the stake in polycarp this is Britain
[1:22:00] in the fox's book of Martyrs how he laid
[1:22:02] down and he said just give me a little
[1:22:04] bit to pray and he prayed so fervently
[1:22:06] that the guards were convicted in their
[1:22:09] heart and they turned you think in an
[1:22:12] hour like that where there would be no
[1:22:14] power we're taking you to burn you at
[1:22:15] the stake and in that hour he calls men
[1:22:18] to be converted think about in the fox's
[1:22:20] book of Martyrs just written how the
[1:22:21] Believers would be put out on the ice
[1:22:24] cold lake and standing on the frozen ice
[1:22:26] and they would sing songs and people
[1:22:28] would the guards sometimes would throw
[1:22:31] down their their uh their armor and run
[1:22:34] out there to be partakers of that power
[1:22:37] that they saw made manifest there what
[1:22:40] kind of power where people would gladly
[1:22:42] give their lives and in that moment it
[1:22:44] looked like they had no power but a
[1:22:46] power greater than than any that the
[1:22:49] world knows was made in manifest what
[1:22:51] about Peter hanging up side down though
[1:22:53] I don't want to be crucified like my
[1:22:55] Lord hang me upside down the power like
[1:22:58] that where the world is is taking away
[1:23:01] his life taking away everything but he's
[1:23:03] in his last hour he doesn't want to be
[1:23:05] his humility and meekness takes over and
[1:23:08] he says I don't want to I'm not worthy
[1:23:10] to be crucified like that and power Came
[1:23:13] Upon it that he would give his life
[1:23:15] freely
[1:23:16] and at the end of brother random's life
[1:23:19] this is one of the things that they
[1:23:20] always like to quote
[1:23:22] it looked like his message had less
[1:23:24] power at the end than at the beginning
[1:23:26] because he started preaching at little
[1:23:28] home churches little things little uh
[1:23:30] just little trailers and things just you
[1:23:33] can hear on the tapes it sounds like it
[1:23:35] used to he used to create preach a great
[1:23:36] big coliseums where it just echoed but
[1:23:39] then at the end of his ministry at just
[1:23:40] a little small little group of people
[1:23:42] where the greatest things power
[1:23:46] his ministry was leading up to that
[1:23:49] great power the opening of the word the
[1:23:52] revealing of these Mysteries to give us
[1:23:54] power because that's what the third pool
[1:23:56] does that's what the uh the seventh seal
[1:23:59] the opening of the word all these things
[1:24:01] to give us power to open up the diet to
[1:24:04] open up everything so that the fullness
[1:24:05] of God could come into the bride and
[1:24:07] there won't be anything to prohibit it
[1:24:09] no doubt in this at all no unbelief
[1:24:11] nothing to hinder God's power being made
[1:24:14] manifest in US
[1:24:16] what about Jacob weak and limping
[1:24:20] where he wrestled all night until he
[1:24:22] brother Randall said he he just he got
[1:24:24] weak and yielded to the angel
[1:24:27] and he got the angel touched him and he
[1:24:30] never walked the same again it looked
[1:24:32] like he got weak it looked like he lost
[1:24:34] but in that weakness that he was weak
[1:24:37] the night before but the next day he
[1:24:39] walked with power toward Esau because
[1:24:42] something had changed and he never
[1:24:43] walked the same again now that in the
[1:24:46] Old Testament the Old Testament types
[1:24:47] talk about having power with God power
[1:24:50] through faith power through Revelation
[1:24:51] the power that Abel had and all the all
[1:24:53] the men that you if you walk through
[1:24:55] Hebrews 11 look at all these men that
[1:24:56] have faith with God power with God
[1:24:58] because they believed God's message
[1:25:01] but now where should we be today
[1:25:04] where God is living inside of US
[1:25:06] Clothing in itself availing us in our
[1:25:09] flesh
[1:25:11] when no ecclesiastical system in the
[1:25:14] world can explain it away from you then
[1:25:16] you've got power
[1:25:17] with God where nobody there's nothing
[1:25:20] anybody can tell you to say well maybe
[1:25:22] this isn't right because you've got a
[1:25:24] revelation from God right
[1:25:26] okay
[1:25:27] all right you've got something real
[1:25:32] something true let me uh I'm just gonna
[1:25:36] switch gears a second here and look at
[1:25:38] some quotes
[1:25:40] and we'll be closing in just a minute
[1:25:46] you know Jesus told the disciples I'll
[1:25:48] make you Fishers for men
[1:25:51] and in that and all those little third
[1:25:53] pool visions and things
[1:25:55] the angel taught brother Branham how to
[1:25:58] fish
[1:25:59] the fish that were deep down right
[1:26:01] they were interested in hearing the
[1:26:03] Mysteries here in the gospel
[1:26:06] and I believe that we're all interested
[1:26:08] in hearing something that will give us
[1:26:10] power
[1:26:14] I I didn't give the brothers in the back
[1:26:16] this quote but this is in a resume of
[1:26:17] the ages
[1:26:19] oh this is in the church age boot
[1:26:21] chapter 10.
[1:26:23] if ever an age received a message loud
[1:26:26] and clear this age did
[1:26:28] it was and is that Old Testament truth
[1:26:32] the son of the bond one will distress
[1:26:33] the son of the free woman into the son
[1:26:35] of the bomb want to be cast out that
[1:26:37] lets us know that the hatred and
[1:26:39] blasphemy of Satan against the true
[1:26:40] Christian will be vented through a group
[1:26:42] who are nominal false Christians and
[1:26:44] this will increase until God uproots
[1:26:46] that false Vine at the end of the layout
[1:26:49] of CN age
[1:26:51] so when you see people turning and
[1:26:52] rending and and doing things that's
[1:26:55] right that's how it's supposed to be
[1:26:58] you know to be honest when I was a lot
[1:27:00] younger in the message I I kind of
[1:27:02] wondered how there could be so many
[1:27:04] people to believe the message
[1:27:07] because it seemed like the way that the
[1:27:09] continent of the scripture ran it should
[1:27:11] be just a very hey you know the way I
[1:27:14] believe it is it it if you put a lot of
[1:27:17] little kids in a room and put a cupcake
[1:27:18] out in front of them they might not all
[1:27:20] like chocolate cake they might say well
[1:27:22] I don't like it and you put the gospel
[1:27:24] in a room and everybody's not going to
[1:27:27] like it but I like it very much I I
[1:27:31] appreciate the word you know that's how
[1:27:33] that's how it's not that God forced the
[1:27:36] chocolate cake Force the the word forced
[1:27:40] us to believe it but we have a choice we
[1:27:42] have a choice to believe it and God just
[1:27:44] like he's looked down and saw David's
[1:27:46] choice that he would believe it and
[1:27:48] accept it and run with it I believe he's
[1:27:50] looked down and saw our choice and
[1:27:53] that's my faith and I believe that
[1:27:55] everybody in this building
[1:27:57] that's my confession that that we'll all
[1:28:00] come to it
[1:28:02] and now let's go ahead and pull up that
[1:28:04] first quote Brothers
[1:28:06] um
[1:28:08] number one take the rod and gather the
[1:28:10] people
[1:28:13] now get ready because I believe these
[1:28:15] are some good quotes
[1:28:18] paragraph e37
[1:28:21] hey he's talking about the healing line
[1:28:23] and the prayer different cases cancer
[1:28:25] cases and things that same as Christ can
[1:28:28] heal you make you well sir let's keep on
[1:28:29] down to where I've highlighted did you
[1:28:31] ever see a person that was possessed of
[1:28:32] demons
[1:28:34] and this was my prayer years ago when I
[1:28:36] was when I was praying for the baptism
[1:28:38] of the Holy Ghost and seeking it that I
[1:28:41] I I kind of I would confess this to the
[1:28:43] Lord that I believe that you know you
[1:28:45] look around and see
[1:28:47] people filled with demon power and doing
[1:28:49] things and it looks like they they've
[1:28:51] got power power to throw people across
[1:28:53] the room and power like that but what
[1:28:55] about what God can do for you with the
[1:28:57] power of the Holy Ghost I believe if if
[1:29:00] he can give if the devil can give
[1:29:02] somebody power like that then that God
[1:29:05] can give somebody so much more power and
[1:29:07] look at this look at this quote how much
[1:29:09] more power
[1:29:11] there are many times their their power
[1:29:13] because the devil has given them
[1:29:15] superpower
[1:29:16] if the devil can give a man five or six
[1:29:18] times his power what all the Holy Spirit
[1:29:20] to do a million times your power he is
[1:29:24] your strength and your help do you
[1:29:25] believe that have faith in God
[1:29:30] let's look at number two
[1:29:34] now watch this doctrine of Baylor most
[1:29:36] careful carefully notice above all that
[1:29:38] it is the deliberate maneuver of a
[1:29:40] corrupt clergy to bind the people to
[1:29:43] them by Leading the People deliberately
[1:29:45] into the sin of unbelief deliberately
[1:29:47] well look at what that brothers that
[1:29:51] that his brother said that he
[1:29:53] deliberately preached psychology for a
[1:29:55] year and cloaked it behind words of
[1:29:58] conceit and deceit and and smiling and
[1:30:01] things
[1:30:02] and
[1:30:06] my
[1:30:07] the nicolete in Doctrine was the
[1:30:10] corruption of the clergy as they sought
[1:30:11] political power and I put this in here
[1:30:13] because
[1:30:14] this is what binds us unbelief is what
[1:30:17] binds us it keeps us from realizing from
[1:30:20] enjoying the liberty of God
[1:30:24] as they saw political power among
[1:30:26] themselves while balaamism is the
[1:30:27] subjection of the people of their system
[1:30:28] of creed and worship in order to hold
[1:30:30] them now watch this carefully what was
[1:30:32] it that bound the people to the nominal
[1:30:34] church and thereby destroyed them it was
[1:30:36] the Creeds and dogmas formed into church
[1:30:38] tennis it was the doctrine of the Roman
[1:30:40] Catholic Church they were not given the
[1:30:42] True Food the word they were given the
[1:30:45] food that came from idol worship
[1:30:47] Babylonian paganism wrapped up in
[1:30:49] Christian terminology
[1:30:51] you know brother Brown preached about
[1:30:53] case Division I believe if you can catch
[1:30:55] the vision of this little simple truth
[1:30:57] that they really get the power of God in
[1:31:00] your life it's got to be the word of God
[1:31:01] has to be revealed to you then you'll
[1:31:04] begin to attend church come to church
[1:31:06] and and study to show thyself approved
[1:31:09] unto the god study and remember study
[1:31:11] includes a lot of different things
[1:31:12] coming to church studying your Bible
[1:31:14] praying all those things and if you
[1:31:17] catch the vision it makes it so much
[1:31:20] easier to do these little things if you
[1:31:21] know why you're doing it if God reveals
[1:31:24] it to you why it's important now birth
[1:31:26] pains number three
[1:31:29] no man has a right to preach the gospel
[1:31:31] until he's met back met God back on the
[1:31:33] back side of the desert in that burning
[1:31:35] bush to where there's no ecclesiastical
[1:31:37] system and the world can explain it away
[1:31:39] from you now that's how every believer
[1:31:41] should be but of course you shouldn't
[1:31:43] present it you shouldn't be speaking it
[1:31:45] unless you've got this but now every
[1:31:47] believer should come to this place where
[1:31:49] there's no nobody can come up to you and
[1:31:51] say well have you read this quote have
[1:31:53] you seen this and then it pulls you away
[1:31:56] from you should be so solid that's what
[1:31:59] we should all be striving for I believe
[1:32:00] is where we come to it up just a solid
[1:32:05] the solid rock of Revelation on which we
[1:32:08] stand number four
[1:32:10] I I'm sorry I hope I'm not wearing you
[1:32:12] out
[1:32:15] and that's what's the matter with the
[1:32:16] Pentecostal church tonight
[1:32:20] the Full Gospel people they just don't
[1:32:22] realize who they are
[1:32:25] right maybe that's the same problem we
[1:32:26] have
[1:32:27] to realize the power of God is in us and
[1:32:30] if we can just
[1:32:31] believe God's word
[1:32:33] if we can just believe it now let me
[1:32:36] start reading and stop talking you don't
[1:32:39] realize the power of this ride in this
[1:32:40] building tonight but it's harnessed down
[1:32:43] by unbelief
[1:32:44] that's the only thing if God could ever
[1:32:46] get an Avenue to work through you it
[1:32:48] would be marvelous what he could do but
[1:32:50] it's harnessed You Won't Let it Loose
[1:32:53] you keep it with your unbelief
[1:32:56] with unbelief
[1:32:58] now how how do you get how do you get
[1:33:00] rid of your unbelief
[1:33:02] how do you get a revelation in faith is
[1:33:05] a revelation the faith cometh by hearing
[1:33:07] and hearing by the word
[1:33:10] that's why you need to be in church
[1:33:13] yeah
[1:33:16] who hath believed I report number five
[1:33:18] 1951.
[1:33:21] oh my this is such a good one it's a
[1:33:23] short one but a good one his power is
[1:33:26] unlimited amen
[1:33:28] it's limited to your faith
[1:33:31] do you believe it
[1:33:35] right let's look at number six
[1:33:38] my new ministry 1959.
[1:33:43] Divine healings for you if God will
[1:33:45] reveal that to you that's for you but
[1:33:46] you can't just stumble it it's got to
[1:33:48] come by Revelation and when it's
[1:33:50] revealed that now he's talking about
[1:33:51] healing now but I think this applies to
[1:33:53] anything because he said once you've got
[1:33:55] if God give you the baptism the Holy
[1:33:56] Ghost then he can heal you and you
[1:33:58] that's that's one of the things that
[1:34:00] stumbles people he talked about coming
[1:34:01] into the prayer line and and somebody
[1:34:03] that was maybe just the prostitute off
[1:34:05] the street would get healed and somebody
[1:34:07] that would feel the Holy Ghost would
[1:34:09] struggle because they all these flus
[1:34:11] were stopped up you start thinking that
[1:34:13] your your memory and your reason and all
[1:34:15] these things are stopped up and you
[1:34:16] think that healing is not for you when
[1:34:19] it's laying right there on the buffet
[1:34:21] table of God's word divine healings for
[1:34:23] you if God will reveal that to you that
[1:34:25] that's for you but you can't just
[1:34:26] stumble it it's got to come by
[1:34:27] Revelation and when it's revealed that
[1:34:29] by his stripes you were healed there's
[1:34:30] nothing Satan can even do as our young
[1:34:32] brother from Sellersburg said all the
[1:34:34] Devils couldn't move it sure when
[1:34:36] something is revealed
[1:34:38] where something is revealed let me I'm
[1:34:40] trying to I'm about to run out of time
[1:34:43] and uh
[1:34:47] let's go to number nine
[1:34:50] it doesn't take
[1:34:53] what we would think a great thing it
[1:34:55] only takes a hand that's completely
[1:34:57] Anointed with the Holy Ghost with God's
[1:34:58] power to strike down an enemy under any
[1:35:00] circumstance
[1:35:02] the musicians can go ahead and come
[1:35:04] forward I'm just finishing up
[1:35:07] the eagle in her nest number 10.
[1:35:10] oh brother the Lord Jesus is coming
[1:35:12] someday the Great Eagle of heaven and
[1:35:14] only those who are magnetized by the
[1:35:16] power of the Holy Ghost will take that
[1:35:17] ride bolted down Creeds and
[1:35:19] denominations and shavings of aluminum
[1:35:22] light thinkers light ambitions
[1:35:25] I think the Church of God should be the
[1:35:27] highest thinker
[1:35:28] the highest Ambitions that there is in
[1:35:30] the world ought to dwell with Christians
[1:35:32] to impress the mark to the High Calling
[1:35:34] of Christ certainly
[1:35:36] now what I want to leave you with
[1:35:39] is that when David killed that Goliath
[1:35:41] that killed what represented the devil
[1:35:43] he destroyed it
[1:35:46] he smote it down by the power of God
[1:35:50] you remember what all the other all the
[1:35:52] other Israelites did
[1:35:54] they started killing Phyllis things too
[1:35:56] because they began they caught the
[1:35:58] Revelation that God was with him and if
[1:36:01] I could leave you with anything it's
[1:36:02] that remember that God is still that's
[1:36:05] what that's what when we look when we
[1:36:06] listen to the tapes and see that God was
[1:36:08] moving in brother Brown's life we
[1:36:10] shouldn't look at that and say well God
[1:36:11] was in his life and and well that's good
[1:36:13] enough for me but I want him to be in my
[1:36:15] life too I want him to be that that's
[1:36:17] evidence that he can be in my life
[1:36:19] that's not just evidence that he can be
[1:36:22] in somebody else's life just over there
[1:36:24] like Perugia but he can be a personal
[1:36:27] presence inside of me living inside of
[1:36:29] me uh working and doing out his will
[1:36:32] inside of me will stand to our feet
[1:36:35] and I wonder if if you want more of the
[1:36:38] power of God in your life and you want
[1:36:40] to start killing more Philistines like
[1:36:42] David just lift your hand up as we go to
[1:36:45] prayer
[1:36:46] this is all about our heads Lord Jesus
[1:36:48] we thank you God for your presence
[1:36:49] tonight
[1:36:50] thank you God for the opening of your
[1:36:52] word thank you God for your grace to us
[1:36:54] Lord Jesus
[1:36:55] Lord we thank you God for examples in
[1:36:57] your word of Great Men of Faith who took
[1:37:00] you at your word and believed that you
[1:37:02] were always the same yesterday today and
[1:37:04] forever and that's my confession tonight
[1:37:07] Lord Jesus said I'm not ashamed of that
[1:37:09] you're still the same yesterday today
[1:37:10] and forever you're still present in your
[1:37:13] people in your church Lord you're still
[1:37:15] walking among the candlesticks still
[1:37:17] walking among the people showing
[1:37:19] yourself Lord and Lord God I pray Lord
[1:37:21] that you'll remember everyone that
[1:37:23] raised their hand tonight Lord Jesus God
[1:37:25] and make yourself visible Among Us Lord
[1:37:28] Jesus make yourself make it so real to
[1:37:30] us Lord Jesus we'll see you not just
[1:37:32] when we come to church but every day at
[1:37:35] the weakest moment of the day at work
[1:37:37] Lord Jesus when it seems like
[1:37:38] everything's going wrong because all
[1:37:41] these men that we just looked at and
[1:37:42] they're live and it seemed like there
[1:37:44] was no power that's when you were the
[1:37:46] greatest on the scene in Samson's life
[1:37:48] when they poked his eyes out and you
[1:37:50] came on the scene and delivered Lord God
[1:37:53] we believe that you're still the same
[1:37:55] you're still able to heal they're still
[1:37:56] able to deliver you're still able to
[1:37:58] save the lost and cause the sin sick and
[1:38:01] the loss to return to you Lord God and
[1:38:03] Lord we thank you because of your power
[1:38:05] Lord now Lord let it be made manifest in
[1:38:08] your in our lives we pray and we ask
[1:38:10] believing Lord Jesus
[1:38:12] we all say Amen
[1:38:16] turn it over to build a deal amen
[1:38:35] he's still here
[1:38:40] he's not somewhere else he's still here
[1:38:43] he's here this is strong this is great
[1:38:45] as he's ever been because if he didn't
[1:38:47] you would have Hebrews 13 8.
[1:39:21] I'm singing today
[1:39:42] I'll hold on
[1:39:48] coming let's see
[1:39:51] let's see if the power of God is
[1:39:53] assigned today
[1:39:55] let's see if it's real hello
[1:40:26] have my heart
[1:40:39] about it do you believe that power is
[1:40:43] still the same
[1:40:48] you know if even side says
[1:40:53] energy cannot be created nor destroyed
[1:41:12] energy
[1:41:14] this didn't start out with some energy
[1:41:17] force in this finally formed into a
[1:41:20] human being
[1:41:24] all the energy there is in the world
[1:41:27] come from our savior our daughter
[1:41:32] our Lord
[1:41:35] me by
[1:41:37] Grace
[1:41:55] the gospel of God is the power under
[1:42:00] salvation
[1:42:12] delivered us with destruction
[1:42:35] been broken
[1:42:38] how about it
[1:43:00] anybody else
[1:43:14] again
[1:43:41] being there
[1:43:46] anybody else
[1:43:54] think about the power of God
[1:44:06] how about it
[1:44:18] foreign
[1:44:45] yeah
[1:44:48] there was a god incident tonight in what
[1:44:50] brother
[1:44:51] Bob was preaching
[1:44:53] um
[1:44:54] I say that because it's a you know a
[1:44:56] coincidence a god incidents right okay
[1:44:58] so
[1:44:59] several years ago about eight years ago
[1:45:03] uh
[1:45:05] I made a series of choices and brother
[1:45:07] Bob was talking about that during the
[1:45:08] end of the sermon and I was already
[1:45:09] thinking on that line before he said
[1:45:11] that I've been thinking and praying
[1:45:12] about it about choices a lot here lately
[1:45:15] but I made a series of choices a bunch
[1:45:18] of them that pretty much affected
[1:45:20] everything from there on out when I
[1:45:22] started my adult life
[1:45:24] I didn't realize how big a lot of these
[1:45:27] decisions would affect things in my life
[1:45:29] going forward or I would have been more
[1:45:31] and I was sincere believe me I was and
[1:45:33] prayerful but I there's I could have
[1:45:36] been more sincere and a lot of the
[1:45:37] things that I decided but you know Gabby
[1:45:40] and I decided we'd either have two kids
[1:45:42] or four kids we'd have an even number of
[1:45:43] kids well so far that's the plan still
[1:45:46] sticking towards to the plan and we
[1:45:48] decided uh that she'd be a stay-at-home
[1:45:51] mom and so far we've carried that out
[1:45:54] and
[1:45:56] but it's you know partly because I'm
[1:45:58] doing the job that I'm doing that I'm
[1:45:59] making enough for her to stay at home so
[1:46:01] that's why I'd hate to see this job go
[1:46:03] I'd hate to lose it
[1:46:05] uh
[1:46:07] but my boss came to me back when he
[1:46:09] offered me this position he said if
[1:46:11] you're willing to miss church every so
[1:46:13] often on a Wednesday night
[1:46:16] he said uh
[1:46:18] that you can have this job driving
[1:46:21] okay just bear with me for a second okay
[1:46:23] so
[1:46:25] so I took that job and that was it I
[1:46:27] mean I didn't I should have said I'll go
[1:46:29] home and pray about it I'll go home and
[1:46:30] think about it but right there on the
[1:46:32] spot I said oh sure you know I mean I
[1:46:34] was 21 years old or so
[1:46:36] I said well I mean I I was young and
[1:46:39] dumb and I said well sure I'll take it I
[1:46:41] don't mind missing every so often he
[1:46:42] didn't say how often that would be
[1:46:44] I thought it'd be once a month maybe at
[1:46:46] the most and at times during the summer
[1:46:49] he gets to where it's almost every
[1:46:50] Wednesday night we don't get to come to
[1:46:51] church because I'm hauling chicken so
[1:46:53] much
[1:46:54] and one of the things I'd hate about
[1:46:55] losing that job too is because I it's my
[1:46:58] prayer closet I drive an 80 000 pound
[1:47:00] prayer closet
[1:47:01] you know and I get a lot of praying a
[1:47:03] lot of reading it's like brother Dale's
[1:47:05] job at GM he has he had time to read and
[1:47:08] study and pray I worked 14 hours a day a
[1:47:10] lot of days and I'm only on the road
[1:47:11] eight so during those eight hours I had
[1:47:13] to listen to sermons and during the rest
[1:47:15] of the time at The Farms I'm waiting to
[1:47:17] load I'm reading my Bible and praying
[1:47:19] it's a great opportunity
[1:47:21] so I want the Lord to work it out if
[1:47:23] there'd be anyway but I prayed about it
[1:47:25] for years
[1:47:26] and I don't know why I've never asked
[1:47:28] y'all to
[1:47:29] but there's a lot of power here like but
[1:47:31] the ball was talking about represented
[1:47:33] in this group
[1:47:34] I want y'all to agree with me
[1:47:36] and that the Lord will work something
[1:47:37] out
[1:47:39] if it's his will for me to keep this job
[1:47:41] if not then so be it because what he
[1:47:43] wants for me is a lot better than what I
[1:47:44] want for me and for my family
[1:47:47] so we just want to be at church only
[1:47:49] tonight is what I'm saying
[1:47:51] and it's been more of a burden the last
[1:47:53] few weeks because of a series of
[1:47:54] circumstances we had a Kentucky trip
[1:47:56] followed by me working late on Wednesday
[1:47:58] night followed by a funeral service this
[1:48:01] past Sunday that we had to miss the
[1:48:02] church so but that's made me even more
[1:48:04] sincere about really just wanting to get
[1:48:06] this thing over with and just get
[1:48:07] something worked out I mean just a
[1:48:09] different schedule and the same job
[1:48:10] would be perfect so just pray with me
[1:48:12] just agree with me thank you Jesus
[1:48:17] that's where we'll just pray
[1:48:19] believe it you work it all out on him
[1:48:23] you believe that
[1:48:25] you believe that he'll work it all out
[1:48:28] well that's just thinking for it
[1:48:30] all right Lord Jesus
[1:48:33] you know our brother you know the
[1:48:35] sincerity of heart and
[1:48:37] things father
[1:48:39] we just pray that you'd help him and you
[1:48:42] work everything out for your honor and
[1:48:44] Glory
[1:48:45] and Lord we know you will
[1:48:48] sometimes we don't understand maybe your
[1:48:51] ways and things but yet we accept it and
[1:48:54] we say thank you we believe you because
[1:48:57] all is well
[1:48:59] we thank you for your loving and Grace
[1:49:00] into it thank you for the message
[1:49:02] tonight our brothers brought unto us
[1:49:04] because truly we believe in your power

[1:49:10] is the greatest thing in the world to
[1:49:12] realize that our God is real and he's
[1:49:15] Among Us and doing and moving
[1:49:17] Lord not like the world of thinking that
[1:49:20] well we just go to church but we come
[1:49:23] believing you and expecting you to meet
[1:49:25] us and guide us Lord just help us bless
[1:49:29] everybody now on the way home give
