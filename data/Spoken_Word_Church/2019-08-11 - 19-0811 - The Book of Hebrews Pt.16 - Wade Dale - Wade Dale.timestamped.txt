[0:00] and was delivered of a child when she
[0:01] was past age because she judged him
[0:03] faithful who had promised their for
[0:09] spraying their even of one and him as
[0:13] good as dead
[0:14] Abraham ninety nine Sarah close collects
[0:17] they made so many as the stars of the
[0:20] sky in multitude as the sandwich by the
[0:23] sea shore innumerable that's what came
[0:26] from that Union right these all died in
[0:30] faith not having this of this not having
[0:36] received the promise that what is the
[0:41] promises God's going to enter into a
[0:45] group of people and have a brother
[0:48] that's the promise when god in genesis
[0:51] 3:15 that's the greatest promise i'll
[0:53] put enmity in other words here they're
[0:54] living in they're living in they're
[0:57] living in a sinful world they're living
[0:59] in a post eden world where you have to
[1:04] be born of sex you have to grow up and
[1:07] die just the way this and if we don't
[1:12] have any you know what hope do we have
[1:14] like brother george Quinn and I were
[1:16] coming yesterday he said you know you
[1:17] see people and stuff like being in China
[1:19] in different places Indonesia and he
[1:22] said they just walked like zombies he
[1:25] said I had 100 dollar bill in my pocket
[1:27] and he said I was going to give up huh
[1:30] twenty dollar bill I want to give a
[1:32] twenty dollar bill to the first person
[1:33] that smiled at me he said I still have
[1:35] my 20 dollar things went right through
[1:40] the Steve Indonesia he said smile I'm
[1:42] sure that's my god he didn't you know go
[1:44] over Lee god blessed year of hey but he
[1:47] smiled at people he said not one person
[1:49] even from the kids up didn't you smile
[1:52] at me one time put that toy meal that in
[1:54] the park so I see they're just they're
[1:56] moving through life with no promise but
[2:00] having seen them afar off and were
[2:03] persuaded of them now what were they
[2:05] persuaded of paper
[2:06] l saw I've been reading in the book or
[2:11] shirt I've been reading in a book of
[2:13] Isaiah now I am kind of interesting
[2:16] brother George Quinn just come back from
[2:17] from Israel with his life and they have
[2:20] the not the original book of Isaiah but
[2:22] the old hold-hold manuscript of Isaiah
[2:25] they have it on display well brother
[2:27] I've said that's the 66 chapters is the
[2:30] 66 books of the Bible it's a complete
[2:32] commentary of the Bible in the book of
[2:35] myself if you'll read the book about
[2:38] that it keeps talking about Redemption
[2:40] Redemption Redemption Israel to be
[2:44] redeemed well yes we're gonna be
[2:45] redeemed but you got to read yourself in
[2:47] that table Isaiah where it says who have
[2:50] believed our report who they are my lord
[2:52] talk about Jesus Christ all right
[2:57] therefore sprang there even a 1 and him
[3:00] as good as dead so many as the stars
[3:02] it's got a multitude established by sea
[3:04] shore innumerable these all died in
[3:06] faith not having received the promises
[3:08] now the promise the promise genesis 3:15
[3:12] i'll put enmity between thy seed and the
[3:14] seed of the woman and you hope the seed
[3:16] of the woman will breach the head of the
[3:19] serpent and in other words bring this
[3:21] thing all back together again right
[3:22] that's the promise the promise was to me
[3:27] the promise was is that Adam and Eve
[3:29] we're going to repopulate or populate
[3:33] not repopulate populate the world with
[3:36] us with that Genesis 1:26 man that God
[3:41] said let us create man in our own image
[3:42] in our likeness you heard me that's my
[3:44] favorite scripture that I preached on
[3:45] many many many times
[3:47] that's what comes to you to new birth
[3:48] but what happened with Adam was I
[3:50] haven't had to give all that back till
[3:52] he sinned and when he said he couldn't
[3:54] produce mm-hmm there was no clean womb
[4:00] for him to produce God lived and God
[4:03] wasn't one to produce him a female one
[4:05] oh you know the loins hey this is the
[4:10] womb that he wanted to produce the
[4:13] spoken word is the original see
[4:15] Abraham get the thought and Bob black
[4:17] the thought went to Eve you can see just
[4:20] like what happened to Mary don't say it
[4:23] but spoken word begin unto me according
[4:26] to thy word he would say and then here
[4:29] would come oh boy just so simple but
[4:32] remember what happened was Satan you
[4:34] they to Satan do that so he blocked it
[4:38] he blocked it and got him close one back
[4:41] up the natural one and the spiritual one
[4:46] believed closed it backed up so she
[4:48] couldn't get revelation anymore I don't
[4:51] have a revelation I'm just I'm just this
[4:53] way when Adam and Eve got throw down the
[4:56] Garden of Eden Adam did not quit being
[4:59] the son of God okay so the Bible said he
[5:02] was the son of God
[5:03] now remember his body started getting
[5:06] older he lived nine hundred some years
[5:07] but his body started getting older but
[5:09] I'm telling you he had to be the doctor
[5:11] the nurse the herbalist the physician
[5:14] the pharmacist he had to be the keeper
[5:17] of the land
[5:18] you understand what I'm saying they like
[5:20] nobody but Adam and even the two boys
[5:22] and one of them got killed Abel so Adam
[5:26] still was the god of the earth sorry
[5:29] that's just way I say it they still had
[5:31] to go to Adam I believe to get things
[5:33] natural and he could tell them what
[5:37] happened in the garden cuz he wasn't one
[5:41] to did and then Adam was the one that
[5:45] remember Adams when he sold us out of
[5:47] money he didn't sell us out of Adam
[5:50] soldier side all right but what happened
[5:53] was Adam sold us out thinking he might
[5:56] could get even bring her back into the
[5:58] garden but remember brother Brown said
[5:59] he tried he went out to get even said
[6:01] God wouldn't let him back in yeah cuz
[6:03] remember and you've heard this preach
[6:07] many times before about Adam putting
[6:08] natural seed in the savor mind or that's
[6:11] that's not even that's horrible actually
[6:14] to even think that revelation was a
[6:17] revelation
[6:18] Adam seeds what polluted the earth not
[6:21] made it better
[6:22] great its natural seed no man's natural
[6:24] see you say well what do you do well
[6:27] this is my song the whole thing is he
[6:29] knew what the beach today and he knew he
[6:31] had Adam being the god of the earth he
[6:34] had watched the animals we're never
[6:36] gonna get finished for this channel the
[6:38] animals he saw what they produce what
[6:41] they they they produced actually right
[6:43] and he knew the wound would close up at
[6:46] a certain length of time well he knew he
[6:48] didn't get to Eve that the whole race
[6:51] she he had to kill he would have to do
[6:54] away with her because she would have
[6:55] Steve in the Beast and then that was
[6:56] wound would be closed and he not tell
[6:58] her but he took her to his self and not
[7:01] to save her really my thoughts on it was
[7:05] the save himself so that was his lineage
[7:09] then he's trying to save he's not trying
[7:11] to save that be splendid keep trying to
[7:13] save his lineage being guarding her
[7:15] he knew all these things but he didn't
[7:18] have sex with Eve saber
[7:27] he never stayed he planning to stay in
[7:30] her no he didn't he did it because not
[7:35] to save her no he did not
[7:37] you can't have a setback in salvation
[7:41] period pricing that's what killed us huh
[7:45] that's why we're dying that's why I Adam
[7:50] but to preserve life to preserve his
[7:53] lineage he knew he had to do what he did
[7:55] not to say berkos remember he went out
[7:58] and did that and he didn't get to go
[8:00] back in the garden comes remember Adam
[8:01] I've been the god of the earth but he
[8:03] was not the Savior
[8:04] there is one Savior next Jesus Christ
[8:07] which came without saying and you and I
[8:10] are going back to being without sex in
[8:12] our new birth the new birth wipes out
[8:16] remember brother Graham said it zeros
[8:17] out the sex act that brought you here
[8:20] Oh preach that mother yeah anyway so
[8:25] stop there
[8:26] but true I mean it's and I heard so me
[8:28] all the way many so it's wrong if
[8:30] there's right it's wrong it's not even
[8:33] back to me that's vulgar to think that
[8:37] in your mind then Adam would have to
[8:39] have sex with levy saver well number one
[8:44] your one on one do they man because
[8:45] they're so anyway but be careful you
[8:52] know why until some big-name preacher
[8:53] preached it yes some big-name noted
[8:59] preacher preaches the same identical
[9:01] thing and then all you know what you do
[9:05] you don't study now you say it just
[9:06] because somebody else said actually
[9:09] me another Georgia talking about you
[9:10] know we all my life in the Baptist
[9:13] Church you know Mama's walking on the
[9:14] streets to go with Jesus you go try to
[9:17] tell them people attacks a lot you must
[9:20] keep your mouth shut or they'll be doing
[9:22] your funeral the next week you know why
[9:25] would that storing grain and the people
[9:27] why don't you burn it over but it's um
[9:30] it's I know I don't have the exact
[9:34] believe the saver there is no salvation
[9:36] in say Amen sorry then that's one guy so
[9:40] problem to start with but I don't
[9:44] couldn't listen Adam couldn't kill Eve
[9:47] because she was literally a part of him
[9:50] not like man kids know she he was lit
[9:53] they were literally one person and he
[9:57] could same way with Christ if you see
[9:59] how the the Christ though being our
[10:01] Savior can come to this earth but never
[10:06] have a sick day he goes through the womb
[10:09] of your mind to give you the new birth
[10:12] makes love to your mind not be dirty it
[10:16] makes love to your mind and that's what
[10:17] it is implants the seed word in your
[10:20] mind you see why this is why that
[10:25] meaning many preachers brother Brown
[10:27] shouldn't you be
[10:28] careful with money women and popularity
[10:30] become with this other day why because
[10:34] your plan see a preacher every Sunday is
[10:39] planting spiritual seed well if you
[10:41] don't have enough spiritual out of it
[10:43] spirituality about you and let your
[10:45] flesh take over
[10:47] it won't take over the whole ego but
[10:51] that's why you see many preachers commit
[10:53] and dr. Klein women are attracted to
[10:57] that good morning that's right that's
[10:59] why you have to be careful brother
[11:02] Graham said money women popularity
[11:04] that's the three things everybody wants
[11:06] to be popular yes yes any money is
[11:14] included all that but remember the Brian
[11:17] Jesus Christ we were when we were born
[11:21] again we were made we're being made love
[11:23] to by Jesus Christ but it's not the very
[11:26] thing that we're we all got here that's
[11:28] why we're dying so how in the world late
[11:31] we had them do anything to make her
[11:35] raise her up no he had to go out with
[11:38] her and he had to start making
[11:40] sacrifices no okay
[11:46] but yeah so let's go get caught in that
[11:48] trap because Moloch over our name
[11:53] friends our name brand person told us
[11:55] that's not true I've done I keep those
[11:58] clothes I don't have a living where
[12:00] brother man I said Abraham's natural
[12:02] seed is what the luthier and you
[12:04] remember that remember evening how see a
[12:07] woman doesn't have the scene right
[12:09] you can only repopulate the world with a
[12:12] man see and that's what's killing us so
[12:17] how can that be a Salvation issue no
[12:20] sorry people that's what gets us in
[12:23] trouble is hey you can't be one word off
[12:27] and take a funny thing you cannot be so
[12:30] everything's going to be riding back to
[12:33] where they can't be up and you know what
[12:37] when one brother Dale preached that
[12:39] several years ago about against how
[12:41] about what I'm just saying somebody had
[12:43] preached that in our church from the
[12:46] same country and have it correct him so
[12:52] you just can't sorry it's just because
[12:56] one big-name person went over there 10
[12:58] or 15 years ago and preached it and we
[13:02] heard appreciate group so just you know
[13:07] just cuz your big name person don't
[13:08] that's the money women popularity park
[13:10] you better go check out what brother
[13:13] Dale says - yeah that's less whatever or
[13:15] me says to you that's why your best but
[13:18] that's not
[13:19] that's right cuz you know you don't want
[13:22] to sway the thought through faith often
[13:26] say let me read this name ago they'll
[13:28] receive strength to conceive seed and
[13:29] was delivered of a child when she was
[13:30] past age because she judged him faithful
[13:32] to that promise
[13:34] then what now the promises now look the
[13:37] promise wasn't that Abraham that Adam
[13:39] and Eve was going to have babies
[13:42] sexually they were going to have babies
[13:45] by the spoken word that's right
[13:47] okay because brother brown preach the
[13:49] spoken word is the original seed anytime
[13:51] you hear by the seed if you're a
[13:54] Christian you should not think of man's
[13:56] seed but the Steep Word of God the storm
[14:01] went toward to so see he was so into
[14:03] good seed remember and other one was the
[14:06] other kind of Steve well it wasn't sperm
[14:09] okay let's just be honest it was see the
[14:13] word this is the seed and you got a plan
[14:17] and once you plant it you gotta let it
[14:20] grow so they didn't receive the promise
[14:23] but they looked and saw it everybody
[14:24] let's go everybody since the dawn of
[14:28] time who was waiting on this time
[14:34] [Applause]
[14:50] [Music]
[15:22] [Music]
[15:29] we're on this Hebrews 11 been on it then
[15:35] only we had got to but verse 4 so let's
[15:42] just continue on this get through this
[15:46] all right
[15:47] so next day next Sunday well do the next
[15:57] Sunday and then somebody's got you at
[16:00] the next Sunday Hey
[16:12] but what happened we're leaving and
[16:15] going to the brother bridge nights next
[16:17] weekend then Sunday but I'm not gonna
[16:19] preach morning because he asked me to
[16:21] preform the next weekend so he's gonna
[16:23] be gone and he hasn't nobody preached so
[16:24] I don't know we're going up and going
[16:26] service with him next Sunday but then
[16:28] the next Sunday I'm going back up to
[16:30] preach 125 right all right so by faith
[16:37] Abel offered unto God a more excellent
[16:41] sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained
[16:45] witness that he was righteous
[16:47] now listen Cain was a righteous and a
[16:52] degree like we're talking about he was
[16:55] right because he did the right thing it
[16:58] was revealed to him that it was blood
[17:01] not cantaloupes and oranges and potatoes
[17:08] because his brother Joel always said how
[17:11] can God blessed something that's cursed
[17:13] and that's what all Cain brought him
[17:14] with all the gifts of the earth and God
[17:16] had already cursed earth right so God
[17:20] testifying of his gifts what to gift the
[17:23] offering of the Lamb and by it he being
[17:26] dead yet speaketh now will may talk
[17:30] about that a little bit more because out
[17:34] of the ground Abel's blood didn't speak
[17:37] but one spoke was is the testimony Abel
[17:41] had Abel was killed for what he believed
[17:43] all right and he was killed by another
[17:46] religious guy named Kane so brother
[17:52] Branham was talking about the end time
[17:55] where you don't have to physically feel
[17:58] people anymore you can just kill their
[18:01] influence and you kill that person right
[18:03] and we see that
[18:04] a lot especially in the message too so
[18:07] just be careful with that by faith Enoch
[18:12] was translated that he should not see
[18:15] death and was not found because God had
[18:18] translated him for before his
[18:21] translation he had this testimony that
[18:23] he pleased God that brother Brown said
[18:27] he pleased God was wrapped in faith
[18:29] Enoch had faith to believe and he walked
[18:33] with him for five hundred years okay he
[18:36] walked through God for five hundred
[18:38] years remembering it was he was then
[18:41] part of all them remembering that son
[18:43] with Methuselah we have known in 69
[18:46] years yes well anyway you got all those
[18:57] genealogies looks like in the Bible just
[18:59] there and I may be wrong I think it's so
[19:02] important they're eating at the food
[19:03] we're all Kenda they're all kin to each
[19:04] other go there what many of them in not
[19:06] will never than that okay it was
[19:10] translated that he should not see death
[19:13] tight brother Brown stop talking about
[19:15] typing Enoch that's the end time bride
[19:19] that's going to take a body change and
[19:21] then remember he types Noah which is
[19:26] Kenda this is great granddaddy know up
[19:29] wrote over the flood but remember that
[19:32] was sin when he got to the end of it but
[19:36] not with Lena so ain't no tops Doubront
[19:37] raptured bride it's going to be raptured
[19:40] before because remember Enoch was taken
[19:43] up before the flood so he didn't have to
[19:46] deal with the flood
[19:49] for before his translation he had this
[19:51] testimony that he pleased God look what
[19:55] mom said though but without faith it is
[19:58] impossible to please him lose him God
[20:02] for he that cometh to God must believe
[20:04] that he is what did he have done brother
[20:09] George and I were talking a few minutes
[20:11] ago we're talking about the Mormons and
[20:14] all the different ones he'd been in
[20:16] contact with and he was talking about a
[20:23] certain religion that was talking about
[20:27] God and Jesus will see that and it's
[20:31] public notice I mean I'm not saying
[20:33] something I shouldn't say on the
[20:34] internet the Mormon violence begins by
[20:39] saying that Maroma had these tablets but
[20:44] that Joseph Smith was what had an
[20:48] audience with Jesus and God at the same
[20:49] time few people Jesus and God appeared
[20:52] to Joseph Smith I said well I just
[20:54] handed them back the Bible I said here I
[20:56] said I can't go with that it's false to
[21:00] anything after that my brother George
[21:01] didn't say after that's false if that's
[21:04] where it came from it was a lot all
[21:08] right you know sorry about that but
[21:09] still people even one true and living
[21:11] God Jesus and another man can't appear
[21:13] to you and yet be Jesus and God okay so
[21:16] yeah but millions upon miss what we were
[21:21] talking about millions upon millions
[21:22] believe that they're Mormons anymore
[21:26] into the second largest religion in the
[21:28] United States the richest besides
[21:32] Catholic Turkey so they must believe it
[21:34] somehow that the course of people even a
[21:37] Trinity you have them popping up all
[21:39] over the place
[21:40] right so well we know we know that's
[21:43] what we become invalid or comment but by
[21:45] the scripture and by the prophets
[21:47] message we know we don't have to guess
[21:50] we know that if it's not by the word is
[21:52] false
[21:54] my brother Graham told us over
[21:57] and he says he said it if you've got two
[21:59] people one's got to leave the devil and
[22:02] one's gonna be gone because can't have
[22:03] two guys standing in front of me so for
[22:25] long she'll be saying but without faith
[22:29] it is impossible to please him who God
[22:31] for he that cometh to God must believe
[22:33] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[22:37] them that diligently what we've been
[22:40] talking about diligently seek Him
[22:44] alright that's what we've been talking
[22:46] about is what I've been talking about
[22:47] brother Dale has been talking about even
[22:50] brother oils and the different ones that
[22:52] come by and little notes in there about
[22:54] doing good doing the little things and
[22:57] doing what you supposed to do read your
[22:59] Bible study go to church go to Bible
[23:01] study and you wonder why you know some
[23:06] people wonder why they're not getting
[23:07] anywhere well are you doing the ABCs
[23:09] if you're doing the ABCs then you need
[23:12] to work on something else to me when you
[23:15] get in this message then you see that
[23:16] what set in stone that can't be changed
[23:19] is what the word says alright and if
[23:22] it's a word and it says in here I'm
[23:24] doing it then see you're out of the work
[23:26] so you'll immediately you go what I need
[23:27] to do in one hand go away and I like
[23:33] even brother Branham the other day
[23:36] some additional quotes up nobody with a
[23:39] problem and somebody's talking about
[23:41] something you know brother Brown told us
[23:43] how spiritual is this brother Browns
[23:46] issues if you're standing see start
[23:48] giving stuff away right he just say
[23:50] going to prayer closet and start praying
[23:52] to God to change it he said you're
[23:54] stingy start giving stuff away
[23:55] he said do the Bible verses you look
[23:58] that word path diversity says
[24:00] four thousand old mansion but most of
[24:02] the time is that if you're this do
[24:07] something else then that's just kind of
[24:10] really too simple you say oh brother I
[24:13] need a lot I need a lot to come down
[24:15] into the room and I need somebody to
[24:17] prophesy over brother ground did I
[24:21] prophesied over the whole bride told us
[24:24] what to do you still like a cross I
[24:26] didn't go that's just too simple
[24:30] i faint no one no watch
[24:35] but faith Noah being warned of God of
[24:37] things not as not seen as yet
[24:40] now remember Noah grew up in a
[24:43] civilization just like we're in them but
[24:47] they had never seen rain never never
[24:53] read your Bible the ground the ground
[24:56] itself was actually the water table was
[24:59] so that the top of the ground that the
[25:01] water table would raise up and it would
[25:04] make the crops grow close really to be
[25:07] real I need to be real scientific it
[25:09] doesn't matter how much it rains on the
[25:11] leaves the roots have to get now sure
[25:17] there's a little bit of soaking up but
[25:19] they soak up the sunlight not the water
[25:22] because the water drips off the leaves
[25:24] and if you don't understand being a
[25:28] hunter I like all my fruit trees though
[25:30] you put out your fertilizer you don't
[25:32] put it out next to the tree trunk you
[25:34] basically don't spray it on the leaves
[25:37] you go out to the what they call the tap
[25:39] roots which is now to your youngest root
[25:41] is at the very end of your longest
[25:43] branch you know why because when it
[25:46] rains guess what that's your first
[25:48] sucking umbrella
[25:49] that's your first part of the brain
[25:52] that's going to hit the ground is right
[25:53] there with your fat roots need so same
[25:56] way with with God we see that Noah never
[26:01] saw anything called rain it wasn't they
[26:04] couldn't do --gel they can google rain
[26:07] it was not a word
[26:10] I could have a Google they are Google
[26:13] now they've gotta have something back
[26:14] then you never know you know and yes
[26:17] it's already enough rain the rain
[26:25] it had to be Janice's after the flood or
[26:28] at the flood because before the flood
[26:30] the ground is what the mist coming up
[26:32] from the ground that's what fertilized
[26:35] earth or whatever you want to call it
[26:37] because you know remember the water
[26:39] table was God made it that way that's
[26:42] the original way it's gonna be because
[26:44] remember when we go back to the Garden
[26:46] of Eden
[26:46] we're not will have rain will they tell
[26:51] me of a home I'll be on this guy though
[26:56] they tell me tell me of a nun cloudy day
[26:58] it won't be clouds in the sky brother
[27:00] laptops many times won't be clouds not
[27:02] even be just and that's one but what I'm
[27:04] saying is look at the faith Noah had to
[27:06] have Noah had to walk out to the world
[27:09] to the United Nations and present his
[27:14] program it's gonna rain and they go like
[27:22] that words not in here right yeah what
[27:29] do they write things not seen as yet
[27:32] move with fear thou not fear is in but
[27:37] he knew God had talked to him and told
[27:39] him to do something dad I'm sorry yes
[27:46] that would be a rebel you look at that
[27:48] deal I see what that means
[27:53] hmm
[27:55] hmm you bet cheap not given cheap he
[28:01] prepared an ark for the saving of his
[28:03] house in here and no ago now it gives
[28:05] him a big field contain impossible is no
[28:09] doubt getting him a big field buys him
[28:11] up you know 100 acre feel a hundred acre
[28:14] field and he said I'm gonna build a boat
[28:16] and the people are going be over 80
[28:22] what is that come boats not even in
[28:27] there maybe you know maybe not back side
[28:29] of a boat I'm sure there was water but
[28:32] not either thing rain coming right
[28:35] prepared an ark to the saving of his
[28:36] house but I remember by the which he
[28:39] condemned the world how did he come down
[28:41] the world he condemned the world by
[28:42] doing one God said he condemned the
[28:45] world by building the boat no bills the
[28:47] boat saved his family but condemning the
[28:51] world is 120 years brother Brown said he
[28:53] preached it will rain it will rain it
[28:56] will rain and I'm sure everybody brought
[28:59] their quote book to the minister meeting
[29:04] and told him that wrong he was no I said
[29:09] already
[29:11] he became heir of the righteousness
[29:13] which is by faith those remember Noah
[29:17] became heir of the righteousness which
[29:19] is by faith he just believed same way
[29:23] with this next guy right here by a vase
[29:25] Abraham he believed when he was called
[29:29] to go out into a place which he should
[29:30] have to receive for America
[29:32] oh babe that's our that's our whole deal
[29:36] right there oh babe and he went out not
[29:40] knowing whither he went so that's what
[29:46] faith will did faith will take you
[29:47] somewhere that you think man I don't
[29:49] know about this but
[29:52] like the in doing we're talking coming
[29:54] up the road I'm talking about life faith
[29:57] man you gotta take you take it by faith
[29:59] and then like I've always told you God's
[30:01] nose or the best edges you'll ever get
[30:03] so if you put athletes before the Lord
[30:05] or if you say Lord I wanna buy this car
[30:08] or whatever counts and the deals just
[30:12] keep falling through well that's God
[30:14] telling you no and you can say praise
[30:17] the Lord
[30:17] but I won't that no you gotta obey God
[30:20] listen those that have the Spirit of God
[30:25] in them should be led by the Spirit oh
[30:27] that's right okay now I know as human
[30:30] beings listen we make terrible mistakes
[30:31] a lot of time did you know what it is we
[30:33] overrode what gods told don't die now
[30:39] anybody else in the world you call it
[30:42] luck out there if you want to but I just
[30:43] don't believe in luck right right I
[30:45] don't believe that I don't believe
[30:47] Abraham was what the only bloke Noah was
[30:49] lucky no he did what God said right and
[30:54] they're not eating fried they're not
[30:55] even children of God hello they weren't
[31:00] born again they had an anointing they
[31:01] know when no one come out of the ark and
[31:04] first thing he doesn't built a vineyard
[31:06] and started getting drunk so it showed
[31:09] that he didn't have a lot of salvation
[31:11] but he was saved but he didn't have the
[31:13] new birth all right same way with
[31:15] Abraham Abraham being the father of my
[31:17] face gave His life away twice were tried
[31:20] and laugh to God so thank God doesn't
[31:26] look at all that of us either he just
[31:28] wants it what our end will be the faith
[31:30] he obeyed and he went out not knowing
[31:33] whether he went by faith he sojourned in
[31:36] the land of promise
[31:37] now remember when Abraham first started
[31:39] this journey saying will you put
[31:40] yourself in this position when you first
[31:42] start your journey you really don't it's
[31:45] being a Christian it's like I told you
[31:46] before you're the bride of Jesus Christ
[31:48] and everything so hunky-dory and God
[31:50] gives you whatever you ask
[31:52] I know six months or so into my new
[31:56] burger God would just you
[31:57] answer my prayer you know why was the
[31:59] baby and he didn't want me to fall down
[32:02] and get hurt a whole lot so he just kind
[32:04] of held me alone but then after that he
[32:10] went on vacation and I want anybody home
[32:16] but you know what he wanted you to he
[32:18] wanted you to believe when he's already
[32:20] saying you don't have to come back and
[32:22] tell us this again you don't have to
[32:25] it's already been say it and God's just
[32:29] waiting for it like we were talking
[32:31] about the other day the vision that God
[32:33] saw were just waiting for it to
[32:34] materialize right and that's the same
[32:37] way we label him Abraham called the
[32:39] vision of God that he was gonna have a
[32:40] child now remember he he went through a
[32:43] journey a pretty hard stop he went to
[32:45] Egypt he went to he went to different
[32:48] places and they got him a wife or not
[32:52] wife died in the concubine to you
[32:54] concubine and had a child by it but that
[32:55] wasn't that promise Ishmael wasn't a
[32:59] child but he won the promised child
[33:02] right video now we're gonna go around
[33:05] doing dumb things but those who endure
[33:10] to the end she'll be safe somebody over
[33:12] there so let us say that's going on but
[33:16] he had an inheritance now remember
[33:17] Abraham didn't know it when he started
[33:19] out you don't know what totally what
[33:21] your inheritance is but actually kept
[33:23] knowing God kept saying okay everywhere
[33:25] that your stroller your feet walks I'm
[33:28] giving it to you as an inheritance now
[33:30] you didn't tell him that at first he
[33:31] just said Abraham get up and go see
[33:34] that's justification that's the same way
[33:35] it is in our journey we were babies we
[33:40] have to be led and God leads us to a
[33:42] place but then he finally leads us to
[33:44] the place and he said okay all right
[33:46] I mean you now dress for sin silent
[33:50] that's our problem we don't we
[33:53] we don't trust him so much that way
[33:56] alright so by faith he sojourned in the
[33:59] land of promise as in a strange country
[34:03] that's thinking about this other day but
[34:06] my Walmart and seeing the idiot I don't
[34:11] know don't call me it's they're human
[34:13] they just humans that are blind it
[34:14] they're blinded obviously there is no
[34:18] more mirrors in people's home cuz when
[34:23] they walk out the door oh my lord
[34:26] you know he's like a bouncing ball now
[34:28] you go oh oh oh you kind of have to
[34:32] thank God wants to look up be careful
[34:37] when you look up if you're in a
[34:38] two-story house but I'm telling you
[34:43] though they don't see nothing wrong with
[34:44] us or what they're blinded they're
[34:47] literally blinded man I hate that
[34:51] because every one of them could get
[34:53] salvation and get cry and be right but
[34:58] their choice is not that way I was
[35:00] thinking the other day and think about
[35:04] this what just makes you wanna cry Bill
[35:08] Gates is a multi-billionaire with all
[35:11] which we had some money like him he's
[35:13] gonna have to stand before the wife I'm
[35:15] gonna peek and I'm going again and I'm
[35:17] not all the Clinton name of all name of
[35:24] all all the great man poo one day Jim he
[35:29] doesn't get born again he's gonna have
[35:31] to stand before this guy that we're
[35:33] talking about which you and I are not
[35:36] now that don't make your head swell up
[35:38] that makes you humble to believe that
[35:41] God has give us something that the great
[35:45] men of this world you know you think who
[35:48] I wished I was a great but we've all
[35:50] said that wish not the great baseball
[35:51] player I was
[35:53] the highest office in this world is the
[35:57] biome in that's the highest offices in
[36:00] the world not Supreme Court Supreme
[36:04] Court justices are the apex of the land
[36:10] thus far is saying yes this is right
[36:13] another but you know what they get it
[36:14] wrong abortion and all these different
[36:16] things that they they and they've done
[36:18] the best they could I'm not saying
[36:20] anything against them but one day those
[36:21] great judges are gonna have to stand if
[36:23] they're not born to get you hear what I
[36:24] mean fair not born again they're gonna
[36:26] have to stand before the greatest judge
[36:28] and it's not just Jesus Christ it's us
[36:34] it's Thrones when they open that book
[36:38] there's Thrones what you and I have been
[36:41] standing there and all the great men of
[36:44] the world the greatest you talk about
[36:46] Henry Aaron in Muhammad Ali and all
[36:48] these great people that people look up
[36:50] to and admire and the reason I'm saying
[36:52] this is because Elvis died 42 years ago
[36:55] to life so there's no was Presley the
[36:59] greatest man in the world at that time
[37:01] though but you know what we know what
[37:03] his problem was
[37:03] brother Brown said he sold his soul for
[37:06] a fleet of Cadillac so you know the
[37:09] greatest man in the world you know maybe
[37:10] maybe went Judgment Day comes they'll
[37:12] open up a an aisle for Elvis to walk
[37:15] down but I'm gonna tell you something
[37:16] he's gonna stand before a god and a
[37:20] group of people that's gonna judge that
[37:22] man but what he did if he's not born
[37:25] again I keep saying that just in case
[37:26] there is there is salvation at the last
[37:28] moment all these things I'm telling you
[37:30] what I'm saying is look this promise
[37:33] that he gave Abraham he gave it to us
[37:36] because you and I everywhere we walk
[37:39] that's why I believe Jesus told him said
[37:42] go preach the gospel into all nations
[37:45] baptising my name you follow something
[37:46] when you've done that the end will come
[37:49] why because we need a foot sitting in
[37:52] Japan where they hadn't been a believer
[37:54] they're in now they've got they got
[37:56] messy churches and
[37:57] never was one China Russia Indonesia
[38:01] every country in the world some
[38:04] believers don't have to step foot on
[38:06] that piece of property I just believe
[38:08] that so that's what Jesus was saying
[38:09] going all the world dispersed and
[38:12] wherever the sole of your foot I don't
[38:14] care if it's Antarctica where there's
[38:15] not 500 people living on that basic
[38:17] continent its place anywhere that a
[38:20] bride puts their foot that's the
[38:23] position of the whole whole earth is for
[38:25] us
[38:26] that's the inheritance so listen have
[38:30] faith then it doesn't matter about all
[38:35] these great people that we look up to
[38:37] and we do we honor the president we
[38:40] honor because it's an office all right
[38:42] we honor that because it is an office as
[38:45] an office that man's come up with and
[38:47] you know you're gonna deal with it but
[38:49] one day that person if they're not born
[38:51] again they're going to stand before the
[38:52] judgment seat and be just right or wrong
[38:56] where you're standing there in the
[38:58] righteousness of God and when it's all
[39:01] wiped off and over and done with we're
[39:03] going to step right back down here today
[39:05] we don't okay that's right that's why we
[39:09] don't judge why the Bible really says
[39:11] let the word judge now we know that the
[39:14] word does good written really come on
[39:16] people the word judges you every day you
[39:18] don't have to have a preacher standing
[39:19] in your ear every day you shut down the
[39:22] Holy Ghost in your ear every day that's
[39:23] it all right I feel a little check oh
[39:27] well now you know turn a little bit
[39:30] let's don't do that right and you know
[39:32] what he's still timid till we go on and
[39:36] do it anyway remember you said well that
[39:39] never happened to me it happens a
[39:40] prophet yeah twice never got telling him
[39:45] to go out on a failed Heath because of
[39:46] his mother-in-law and his wife he didn't
[39:48] when you see what he cost me right
[39:51] they went in Africa with those brothers
[39:54] and they said we'll go on this waste and
[39:55] all the Lord says not then you know
[39:57] member brett.lavender vision was God
[39:59] drew a line in the sand don't go any
[40:01] further well guess what they talked him
[40:04] into going so you see what a man you can
[40:07] you can be careful with with stepping
[40:10] over the will of God because remember it
[40:13] wasn't that it was a success as far as
[40:15] people get healed and stuff but they all
[40:17] pay for it
[40:18] so till we pay for it we just have to be
[40:20] careful what we're doing it the same way
[40:22] it was Abraham by faith Abraham didn't
[40:25] have a quote book everything he didn't
[40:26] have a Bible he had no self-help book he
[40:32] had no Joel Olsteen to the look at her
[40:34] whatever you want call it her or nobody
[40:37] zero it was just Abraham saying 'we
[40:41] would know him nobody didn't have
[40:42] anything to go on
[40:44] abraham had a little bit more to go on
[40:46] noah had nothing to go on rain waiting
[40:48] rain it's not even you can't google rain
[40:51] not before the fall I mean before the
[40:53] flood but now they for him received an
[40:58] inheritance he obeyed and that's the
[41:01] same way with us when we get an
[41:03] inheritance by obeying the Word of God
[41:05] right right
[41:07] by faith he sojourned in the land of
[41:09] promise as in a strange country remember
[41:14] you won all these different places
[41:15] Egypt Canaan career he went to bill read
[41:20] the Bible and I used to have a little
[41:22] and maybe in the back to some of the old
[41:24] Bibles the journey of Abraham you watch
[41:27] ReWalk I mean he covered the whole like
[41:29] Middle East Iran Iraq Israel Egypt
[41:35] tanning the different things where
[41:36] Abraham wall to see God said where every
[41:38] soul you feet and he left tell me later
[41:40] on wherever the stole of your feet stats
[41:43] that's your inheritance he said Abraham
[41:45] looked up can you count the stars look
[41:47] down can you count the sand he said no
[41:49] he said well you're in arrogance they're
[41:51] your people will be as that sand of the
[41:54] sea and thank God were included in
[41:58] Wehling in Tabernacles with Isaac and
[42:01] Jacob the heirs with him of the same
[42:03] promise for he looked for a city which
[42:06] hath foundations whose builder and maker
[42:09] is God now he didn't look on a map but v
[42:17] was waiting where he was waiting for a
[42:19] city which hath foundations whose
[42:22] builder and maker done because remember
[42:25] Abraham was living in a time where he
[42:27] did journey he dwelled in the tabernacle
[42:29] of tents different different places he
[42:32] didn't have a city if you'll look
[42:35] Abraham I had no city that he was
[42:38] related where they just said he was from
[42:39] the earth shall be then he got up and
[42:43] went to this town and God wanted this
[42:44] city even got onto this city then in the
[42:47] plains of Mamre wherever that is
[42:49] it's where he met no kezzeme all right
[42:52] now God met God in human flesh free look
[42:55] for a city which hath foundation is
[42:57] built or make her gut now what's
[42:58] wonderful to me Abraham look from this
[43:01] city his whole life because he knew
[43:06] there was a promise that he was going to
[43:08] live somewhere but the problem was his
[43:12] he didn't have enough revelation at the
[43:14] time but thank God we got a prophet that
[43:17] came in the end time and he said the
[43:19] very spot now brother Ram had to get a
[43:21] revelation he had to get a vision that
[43:23] the very spot that Abraham took
[43:26] communion with Melchizedek he said
[43:28] that's where the city's gonna push up
[43:30] and the city he was looking for was
[43:33] right up under his feet he didn't know
[43:34] it but see we know that though somewhere
[43:38] over there in Israel wherever he was
[43:40] standing that there's a pyramid-shaped
[43:42] mountain it's 15 miles this way in this
[43:45] way in that way
[43:46] lay this right under their feet and when
[43:49] this is all over with it's just gonna
[43:50] push right straight up MA I believe it's
[43:54] there already I don't believe it has to
[43:55] be created I believe it's there mm-hmm
[43:58] because whatever happens to the rest of
[43:59] the earth it's not gonna matter that's
[44:01] down under the earth and then the city
[44:03] the pride of the city is going to come
[44:05] right down on top of that mountain
[44:07] what a beautiful picnic it won't be a
[44:09] vision when it happens
[44:12] so the city he's looking for we've
[44:14] already found we know exactly where it
[44:16] is and we have a prophet come in the end
[44:20] time thank God to give us that vision of
[44:25] that insight that's why I said we're
[44:28] prophetic people because prophetic
[44:29] people can put these things together you
[44:31] can read my neighbor Hammond and Stevie
[44:32] that you're looking for then when
[44:34] brother Brown says right where he met
[44:36] Mel Cassidy took communion needs to
[44:38] right there under his feet that's where
[44:39] that thing's gonna push up when he's the
[44:41] only window that geologists don't know
