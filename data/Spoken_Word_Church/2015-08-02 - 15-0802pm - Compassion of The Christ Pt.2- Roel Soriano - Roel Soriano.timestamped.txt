[18:20] the compassion of the Christ amen but be
[18:23] before we go to that I just would like
[18:26] to make a little report on what's
[18:29] been happening in our country by uh way
[18:32] of the mystery Expo seminars amen you
[18:35] may be seated for just a little
[18:39] while
[18:44] amen well if
[18:46] the presentation is ready
[18:56] okay uh this is something that that I
[18:59] think
[19:01] uh right now only happens in our country
[19:04] in the
[19:05] Philippines you know and uh the Lord has
[19:08] given us the inspiration to devise a way
[19:12] to uh take the message to denominational
[19:16] Realms because for for the longest time
[19:19] we've been uh inviting people to come to
[19:22] our meetings uh so they can hear the
[19:24] presentation of the message and they
[19:26] wouldn't come right so what we what we
[19:29] did we just took the message to
[19:32] them we started befriending the uh
[19:38] ministers and the leaders especially of
[19:42] uh different denominational Association
[19:45] Ministerial Association and challenge
[19:48] them that uh we would feed them and uh
[19:52] maybe give them um uh literature and
[19:55] bibles even uh for as long as they can
[20:00] uh they're willing to sit down for a
[20:03] whole day and listen to what we have to
[20:05] say
[20:06] right and uh the Lord really blessed our
[20:09] effort amen hallelujah sir next slide
[20:20] please uh you know but talked about end
[20:23] time evangelism right so this is
[20:27] evangelism uh uh especially meant for
[20:30] the end
[20:31] time so
[20:34] um in 2002 we launched a brave move to
[20:40] present the teachings of the message to
[20:42] denominational ministers Ministerial
[20:46] Association and since then we have
[20:49] presented the message to different
[20:51] regions of the
[20:52] country and God bless the effort and
[20:56] whole churches embrace the message as a
[21:07] result this is a historic Expo
[21:11] seminar that we held in uh Ral
[21:15] Palawan that actually started the
[21:18] Revival in
[21:20] Palawan uh I don't think there is a
[21:24] place uh in the whole
[21:27] country where
[21:29] uh a Revival such as this is taking
[21:32] place now it's in the island of Palawan
[21:35] by the way Palawan the island of Palawan
[21:39] has been voted as the most beautiful
[21:42] island in the whole world can you
[21:44] believe
[21:45] that and uh we were there with brother
[21:48] brother Wade and brother Wade saw one of
[21:52] the expost that we conducted there and
[21:55] he participated in it and the people
[21:58] really appreciated what he had to say
[22:00] about
[22:03] Elijah well
[22:05] the the this picture the Mr Expo seminar
[22:10] we conducted we conducted in Ral
[22:13] town uh in 2012 were 15 ministers from
[22:18] the Baptist and the Pentecostal
[22:22] Realms uh they attended and out of the
[22:25] seminar dozens of ministers have re
[22:28] receiv received the message and are now
[22:30] sharing it with their congregation and
[22:33] many
[22:38] others now this is what I call the
[22:40] buffer
[22:42] crop next Slide the buffer
[22:45] crop this is the latest uh batch of
[22:49] ministers that have received the message
[22:51] because of the Expo seminars amen here's
[22:54] a picture of the latest crop of converts
[22:57] in the island of Pala
[22:59] and we have baptized over 60 ministers
[23:03] over 60 ministers on this island and are
[23:07] now in the process of helping these
[23:10] pastors present the message to their
[23:12] respective churches we now work with
[23:15] over 50 churches and have baptized more
[23:19] than 20 whole
[23:22] congregations in the process glory to
[23:27] God hallelujah
[23:29] amen and here's a picture of the
[23:31] minister
[23:33] converts from different regions of the
[23:37] Philippines converts from different
[23:39] regions of the country are crying out
[23:43] for message materials meaning CDs tracks
[23:49] books tablets laptops to gain more
[23:53] knowledge about the message that we
[23:55] believe and be able to share the same to
[23:58] their
[23:59] people we have voice of God recording to
[24:02] help us but uh we need more than what
[24:06] they are willing to give that's
[24:14] right
[24:15] equipping the next step now is to equip
[24:19] the ministers with correct understanding
[24:22] of the message and to help them get the
[24:26] church established in the word amen our
[24:29] church have been sending teachers along
[24:31] with Bibles and message materials to the
[24:35] churches uh to their churches to help
[24:38] them with Ministry and toote to promote
[24:41] fellowship with other message churches
[24:44] we need to get them established in the
[24:46] word amen yes sir because you know as
[24:48] long as as as soon as they come in the
[24:52] false Doctrine groups they also come oh
[24:55] yeah you know and try to prelate them
[24:58] and that's why there's a real need for
[25:00] Teaching Ministry by the way you're
[25:03] really needed over
[25:05] there and uh uh to to to get the people
[25:10] established in the
[25:16] word here's a picture

[25:46] financial support and is now
[25:49] excommunicated from the
[25:51] group this is now his temporary Church
[25:55] which he erected on borrowed land
[25:59] but when uh brother Wade was there
[26:02] somebody donated a lot to this brother
[26:07] and now they erected a simple church but
[26:10] it's a much better uh church building

[30:03] it a split it's a split of of the United
[30:06] Methodist Church so uh 16 ministers are
[30:12] now in touch with us and wanting more
[30:15] seminars follow-up seminars amen for
[30:18] their group amen that's their people
[30:21] there being
[30:24] baptized and other churches are
[30:26] following suit
[30:30] we need all the ministry that we can get
[30:32] to help these new churches get
[30:34] established in the word they are crying
[30:37] out for more of the message amise the
[30:43] Lord and a lot of other groups are
[30:47] waiting to be baptized
[30:49] over we just don't have the time and the
[30:52] manpower to go to all these places so
[30:55] that they can be baptized over again my
[31:00] projection is that within a year's time
[31:03] most of the new pastors congregation
[31:06] numbering approximately 60 will have
[31:09] been baptized the message
[31:12] way and we need to send more ministers
[31:15] to help groups in the far flung places
[31:19] like the ones the uh I mentioned this
[31:23] morning where you have to walk 8 hours
[31:26] to uh get to the place place and uh some
[31:29] of the churches are in um uh farflung
[31:32] Islands as well is the island of Palawan
[31:36] is is actually a an island group made up
[31:39] of 300 Islands right there in

[31:46] now that believe uh this message on the
[31:50] island here's here are two pictures of
[31:54] some of the tribal churches

[32:02] suud southern
[32:04] Palawan uh there are 15 Mountain
[32:08] churches like this that are now learning
[32:11] the message because their tribal tribal
[32:14] pastors receive the message through the
[32:17] Expos we help these churches educate
[32:20] their own children as the nearest school
[32:23] is 8 hours away on foot the nearest

[42:41] church with a good testimony in the
[42:44] village but Rael prays about improving
[42:47] the condition of their house of worship
[42:50] as you can see it's in in a very bad
[42:53] shape Hallelujah
[43:00] we want to be able to strike while the
[43:02] iron is
[43:05] hot like I said there's no place in the
[43:08] world where this is happening uh uh uh
[43:12] uh this sort of thing is happening in
[43:15] this revival is happening right
[43:18] now uh but the island of Palawan not
[43:22] everyone like the message that we
[43:25] present the ones who reject the the
[43:27] message are quick to spread the word
[43:30] around yeah we hear our names being
[43:33] broadcast over the radio over
[43:37] television you watch out for this roel
[43:41] Sano they're nothing but a cult leader
[43:45] pritter Mass pritter they call
[43:49] us and uh they're nothing but
[43:52] Brites time will come when we will not
[43:54] be able to conduct seminars
[43:57] as denominational leaders have been
[44:00] marking us as branhamites and cult
[44:03] leaders this particular group is hostile
[44:06] to the message being dominated by women
[44:16] preachers and there are big groups that
[44:19] want the
[44:21] seminar this particular full gospel
[44:24] group wants a big seminar
[44:27] to be conducted where hundreds of their
[44:30] Minister members will
[44:33] attend we are not quite ready for such
[44:36] an expensive Endeavor most of our sers
[44:39] are small groups of 30 to
[44:42] 50 which is cheaper and a lot more EAS
[44:45] to manage or
[44:47] handle now we we had that one where over
[44:50] 100 ministers attended in Puerto
[44:53] Princessa but that was the biggest that
[44:55] we had
[44:58] and we need to do followup on these
[45:02] ministers because they're very
[45:05] tender uh the seminars are just introdu
[45:10] introductory uh lectures about the
[45:14] message they're not really in-depth
[45:16] study of the message but we need to do
[45:20] followup uh Ministry to the new converts
[45:24] amen uh so I I could CET your
[45:28] prayers so that God would uh raise up
[45:31] more
[45:32] ministers and God would uh provide so
[45:35] that we can go to all the churches and
[45:38] be able to help these
[45:41] groups and for all this we want to give
[45:44] God all the glory and honor amen praise
[45:47] the
[45:51] Lord
[45:54] hallelujah okay I think
[45:58] it's time to uh continue the preaching
[46:01] this
[46:10] morning
[46:15] Hallelujah the pass the compassion of
[46:17] the The Compassion of the Christ part
[46:21] two that
[46:27] okay
[46:29] amen The Compassion of the Christ part
[46:33] two if you would please stand as we read
[46:36] the word of
[46:43] God in the book of St James chapter 2
[46:47] verse
[46:54] 5-7 God chose the poor
[46:57] to be riched in faith how many can say
[47:00] Amen to that amen James chapter 2:
[47:03] 5-7 hearken my beloved
[47:06] Brethren ha not God chosen the poor of
[47:09] this world rich in faith
[47:13] amen and HS of the Kingdom which he had
[47:17] promised to them that love him
[47:20] amen listen to this but ye have despised
[47:23] the poor
[47:25] right do not rich men oppress
[47:28] you and draw you before judgment
[47:32] seats do not they
[47:34] blaspheme the worthy Name by which by
[47:37] which you are
[47:39] called
[47:42] Hallelujah I certainly believe that the
[47:45] wealth of a
[47:48] person
[47:50] [Music]
[47:52] or or the people that live in a city a a
[47:55] particular place the wealth
[47:59] is inversely
[48:02] proportional to the spirituality of the
[48:05] people I mean the the more wealthy a
[48:09] person becomes the less and less his
[48:13] faith becomes you know you believe that
[48:17] yeah
[48:21] Hallelujah the last scripture I'm going
[48:23] I'm going to read is about leoda
[48:26] Revelations chapter 3: 16-1
[48:30] 17 so then because Thou Art
[48:34] lukewarm and neither cold nor
[48:37] hot I will spew thee out of my mouth
[48:42] because thou sayest I am rich now this
[48:46] lady Zia is saying this about herself I
[48:49] am rich and increas with good and I have
[48:54] need of of nothing
[48:57] but God looks at her differently knowest
[49:00] not that thou art wretched and miserable
[49:05] and poor and blind and
[49:09] naked God blesses the reading of his
[49:12] word you may now be seated thank you
[49:32] I talked to brother Louise about true
[49:34] compassion this morning we discuss at
[49:39] length uh true compassion that comes
[49:42] from God Amen you know we need to have
[49:45] not just the mind of Christ but also the
[49:48] heart of Christ
[49:50] amen and but brother bam said something
[49:53] about true
[49:55] compassion you know
[49:58] uh you can have compassion for let's say
[50:02] the uh the famous children of uh
[50:10] Africa children that are uh under norish
[50:14] or mal noris in
[50:17] Africa but it's
[50:21] different when your son or your daughter
[50:24] your child is the one that's hungry get
[50:26] it
[50:27] hungry there seem to be a deeper sense
[50:31] of compassion that you feel for the
[50:33] child because that's that child has a
[50:36] connection with you am okay because the
[50:40] the Africans they they're so remote you
[50:42] hardly feel their suffering right yeah
[50:45] that's right but when the one that's
[50:47] suffering is right in your household
[50:49] right amen then you really have
[50:51] compassion for that for that person
[50:54] Hallelujah and brother B said something
[50:58] about true compassion here in the
[51:01] message Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[51:04] them
[51:07] forever it says
[51:11] Jesus was more
[51:13] compassionate than any person that ever
[51:17] was on
[51:18] Earth the whole Fountain of compassion
[51:22] was in
[51:24] him and he passed the
[51:27] lame the Hal the the blind the withered
[51:31] the Bible said he did it is that
[51:34] scripture St John chapter 5 read it for
[51:37] yourself he's talking about the uh what
[51:42] do they call that pool the pool of
[51:45] Bethesda were all kinds of sick
[51:49] people were waiting to uh come into the
[51:53] water because they wanted to to be
[51:55] healed amen the the uh uh uh the angel
[52:01] appears and U uh kind of disturbs the
[52:04] water and the first one to to go into
[52:06] the water will be
[52:08] healed so you can just imagine maybe a
[52:11] 100 people around the pool of
[52:15] beesa were there and here comes the Lord
[52:19] Jesus he passes the Cancer
[52:22] Victim he passes the baby with hydrus
[52:26] yeah he passes all kinds of people with
[52:30] all kinds of
[52:31] diseases and he he comes to this one
[52:35] with an illness that's not even
[52:38] lifethreatening
[52:41] and he prays for this one and heals him
[52:46] brother bam says talk about
[52:52] compassion
[52:54] Hallelujah to me what brother vam was
[52:57] trying to come across when he said this
[53:00] is
[53:01] that we have to have
[53:05] discernment we have to have the mind of
[53:09] Christ because
[53:11] you there's there's just no way that you
[53:14] can help everybody every suffering
[53:16] person on Earth Hallelujah
[53:23] but you can help the one that God wants
[53:27] to
[53:29] help Hallelujah and brother benham's
[53:32] explanation was uh when the reason why
[53:36] Jesus went to this particular person was
[53:38] that that was who the father showed
[53:42] him
[53:44] amen Jesus did not just help anybody but
[53:49] he helped the one whom the father showed
[53:53] him and I believe this is the truth
[53:56] through compassion through Godly
[53:59] compassion when you can get the
[54:01] connection between the one that's
[54:04] suffering and God gives you the
[54:07] Revelation that God wants you to help
[54:10] that
[54:11] person Hallelujah well this
[54:15] morning uh after the preaching this
[54:17] morning some of you brothers and sisters
[54:20] came to me and and told me about your
[54:23] experiences about certain poor people
[54:26] yeah poor people that are not really
[54:30] poor poor people that
[54:32] actually uh earn more money being
[54:38] poor well I'm not talking about those
[54:41] kind of
[54:42] people I mean I'm talking about the poor
[54:45] ones that that really can't help
[54:48] themselves you know we have a saying in
[54:50] in the Philippines God helps those who
[54:53] help
[54:54] themselves no God helps those who cannot
[54:57] help
[54:59] themselves
[55:01] Hallelujah and
[55:06] uh I believe even
[55:10] the even those that try to deceive
[55:13] you even people try to deceive you they
[55:16] they just take advantage of
[55:20] you I believe we need to be
[55:23] willing to help them
[55:27] exercise discernment yes but we need to
[55:30] be able to help those who are
[55:33] asking needing help
[55:36] Hallelujah brother bam said don't lose
[55:39] the feeling for the people next slide
[55:45] please he said yeah don't lose the
[55:50] feeling for the people see you must
[55:53] remember that they are not made of Sodom
[55:57] us they are flesh and
[56:00] blood human
[56:02] beings and a soul amen they are human
[56:06] beings that have a soul he said this in
[56:08] standing in the Gap I wrote here
[56:11] missionary rise because I had an
[56:13] experience many years ago when I went to
[56:15] mindo I took some missionary I won't
[56:19] tell you which country he came from but
[56:22] I I I took I took the brother to the
[56:25] tribes you know minister to the tribal
[56:28] people and those tribal people they come
[56:30] down from the mountains where they have
[56:33] to work for a whole
[56:35] day if they're not attending the
[56:37] services they work for a whole day just
[56:40] planting and uh trying to get something
[56:42] to eat or earn a
[56:45] living
[56:47] so that day after the
[56:50] service I wanted to buy them some rice
[56:54] and I asked the brother brother can you
[56:56] help help me I'm a little short on money
[56:59] we need to buy rice for the
[57:02] people and the brother said brother roel
[57:06] I'm sorry but I did not come here to be
[57:08] buying rice for the
[57:12] people
[57:14] and he was a dynamic preacher he's a
[57:17] good teacher but he said I didn't come
[57:20] here to be buying rice for the
[57:23] people hallelujah
[57:26] where's the
[57:28] compassion
[57:38] Hallelujah here's another thing I want
[57:40] to show
[57:42] you is the body is more important than
[57:45] helping the poor
[57:48] yeah God God ordained it that we will we
[57:53] will have the poor always with us
[57:56] in the Book of Matthew chap 26:
[57:59] 6-1 we read here now when Jesus was in
[58:04] Bethany in the house of Simon the leper
[58:08] there came unto him a woman having an
[58:11] alabaster
[58:12] box of very precious ointment and poured
[58:16] it on his head as he sat at
[58:20] meat but notice what happened next when
[58:23] his disciples saw it
[58:26] they had indignation meaning they were
[58:29] upset that this this thing was happening
[58:32] saying to what purpose is this
[58:35] waste so they're looking at it as a
[58:38] wasteful thing you know to what purpose
[58:42] is this waste for this ointment
[58:45] Alabaster which at that time was very
[58:48] expensive might have been sold for much
[58:52] and given to the
[58:54] poor and when Jesus understood it he
[58:58] said unto them why trouble ye the
[59:02] woman for she said she hath wrought a a
[59:07] good work upon me right for listen to
[59:11] what he said ye have the poor always
[59:14] with
[59:15] you but me ye have not
[59:19] always for in that she has poured this
[59:22] ointment on my body and she did it for
[59:25] my burial
[59:29] am what Jesus is trying to tell us here
[59:33] is that the poor will always be
[59:38] around and we should always be willing
[59:41] and ready to help the
[59:43] poor hallelujah but the body of Jesus
[59:47] the body which God prepared for
[59:50] himself the body that suffered at the
[59:54] cross the body that God used to redeem
[59:57] all of
[59:59] us it has to be
[1:00:03] served service has be to be done uh to
[1:00:07] that body and in this uh in this case
[1:00:11] that body was anointed for the
[1:00:15] burial we're talking about worship here
[1:00:18] we're talking about appreciation of the
[1:00:20] body
[1:00:22] Hallelujah this is better than helping
[1:00:26] all the poor people in the
[1:00:28] world this is true
[1:00:33] compassion
[1:00:35] okay true compassion is wanting to do
[1:00:39] service for the body amen yeah wanting
[1:00:42] to help the
[1:00:44] body I hope you're spiritual enough to
[1:00:46] catch what I'm trying to
[1:00:48] say because you are part of the body
[1:00:52] right you are the body of Christ
[1:00:54] Hallelujah and anytime you help any part
[1:00:57] of the body of Christ anytime you help a
[1:01:00] suffering believer you are actually
[1:01:02] serving the
[1:01:06] body
[1:01:09] Hallelujah 2 Corinthians chapter 5 verse
[1:01:13] 10 I don't think I have it
[1:01:17] there but you're familiar with the
[1:01:19] scriptures I'm going to read it for we
[1:01:21] must all appear before the Judgment seat
[1:01:24] of Christ and and that everyone may
[1:01:27] receive the things done in his
[1:01:34] body we're not just talking about
[1:01:36] charitable works
[1:01:38] here we're not just talking
[1:01:41] about helping some
[1:01:44] people but things that are done to the
[1:01:48] body I understand we're going to have a
[1:01:50] communion are we are we going to have a
[1:01:52] communion today Hallelujah
[1:01:56] according that he had done whether it be
[1:02:00] good or bad right you're going to be
[1:02:04] judged by what you have done to the body
[1:02:07] of
[1:02:08] Christ
[1:02:11] Hallelujah in the Book of Luke chap 6
[1:02:14] verse 28 and
[1:02:16] 29 it says here bless them that curse
[1:02:20] you right pray for them which despiteful
[1:02:25] of you you I think this was what the
[1:02:27] brothers and sisters were telling me
[1:02:29] about people that use
[1:02:33] people people that PR pretend to be to
[1:02:37] be suffering to be poor just to take
[1:02:40] advantage of other people right take
[1:02:43] advantage of your soft
[1:02:46] Hearts Hallelujah but you are not to
[1:02:50] supposed to curse
[1:02:52] them but bless them that curse you and
[1:02:55] pray for them that despitefully use you
[1:03:00] right that's right and unto him that
[1:03:02] Smith thee on the one Chek offer also
[1:03:05] the
[1:03:09] other and to him that taketh away the
[1:03:11] cloak forbid not to take thy coat also
[1:03:16] in other words be ready to be taken
[1:03:19] advantage
[1:03:23] off Hallelujah
[1:03:26] you do it in good faith you're doing it
[1:03:30] in service to the body it's up to them
[1:03:33] whether they take advantage of you or
[1:03:36] they squander the help that they get
[1:03:38] from
[1:03:39] you
[1:03:45] Hallelujah I wish to share this
[1:03:47] quotation with you it's a good
[1:03:49] one uh I wonder if the brother can pull
[1:03:53] it up for
[1:03:54] me uh
[1:03:56] it's the message you must be born
[1:03:59] again
[1:04:01] um well brother benam
[1:04:10] says yeah yeah that one good
[1:04:14] good brother Neville says thank you
[1:04:17] brother Brenham and I enjoy doing
[1:04:20] something this
[1:04:21] way because it is this that that helps
[1:04:26] us to be more
[1:04:29] Christlike and spiritual how many can
[1:04:32] say Amen to
[1:04:33] that it helps us to be more Christlike
[1:04:38] and
[1:04:39] spiritual sometimes people say I want
[1:04:42] you to pray for me that I will be a
[1:04:45] better
[1:04:46] Christian well I've already prayed for
[1:04:50] you now I'm going to show you how how to
[1:04:54] be one
[1:04:56] amen he said that's the way to do it and
[1:05:00] open up your bowels of
[1:05:03] compassion and I also know that brother
[1:05:07] ilot he doesn't ask for sympathy because
[1:05:10] of it but he is a crippled man and so
[1:05:14] and has been out of work so we'll just
[1:05:18] this morning open up our hearts and help
[1:05:21] the fox out helps this folk out I
[1:05:26] believe here is the offering place you
[1:05:28] see better
[1:05:30] B announce to the people that they
[1:05:33] should help this crippled person
[1:05:37] right and that is the way according to
[1:05:39] him to be a better
[1:05:42] chrisan Hallelujah is to open the bows
[1:05:46] of
[1:05:47] compassion and try to help those that
[1:05:50] are in
[1:05:54] need serve the ones that are in the
[1:05:59] body Blasphemous
[1:06:02] names 1962 but said now you might say
[1:06:06] look I sure don't like brother Neville
[1:06:10] or I sure don't like brother
[1:06:13] Jones there's a brother Jones here by
[1:06:15] the way I don't like brother so and so
[1:06:19] and something like that but just let
[1:06:22] something happen to him brother
[1:06:25] your heart is
[1:06:27] broke it just nearly kills you see we
[1:06:31] can obtain brotherly kindness and
[1:06:34] feeling for one
[1:06:37] another talk about true
[1:06:40] compassion talk about that connection
[1:06:43] that you have Hallelujah with a fellow
[1:06:46] believer a fellow member of the body of
[1:06:49] Christ right fellow seed Hallelujah
[1:06:54] fellow bride amen thank you
[1:06:59] Jesus three more slides and we're
[1:07:14] done all
[1:07:17] things araban said why do you care for
[1:07:20] your
[1:07:22] brother because you broke bread with him
[1:07:25] here at the
[1:07:26] altar as you will
[1:07:29] tonight then he said you fellowship with
[1:07:32] him you shook his hands you worship with
[1:07:37] him yeah he's your brother and he might
[1:07:40] do something in the flesh that you would
[1:07:42] disagree with because you just kind
[1:07:46] of stay which you ought not to do but
[1:07:49] shun him a
[1:07:51] little can you identify with this you sh
[1:07:55] a a brother or a sister a little because
[1:07:59] you don't like what he's doing but in
[1:08:01] the bottom of your heart but M says if
[1:08:04] something happened to that brother it
[1:08:07] would just nearly kill you or that
[1:08:11] sister I say Amen to
[1:08:14] that and then he says if you would come
[1:08:17] seeking the Holy Spirit and let him the
[1:08:22] faith that you've got in him add to that
[1:08:25] virtue and to that brotherly kindness 2
[1:08:29] Peter 1:7 until you are built in the
[1:08:32] full stature of Christ and then the last
[1:08:36] thing is love which God the Holy Spirit
[1:08:40] seals you to your
[1:08:43] destination I'm going to read the last
[1:08:47] slide brother Braham said you cannot
[1:08:53] impersonate what am I talking about
[1:08:55] about service to the body of Christ
[1:08:59] right you cannot impersonate brotherly
[1:09:03] kindness you cannot impersonate the love
[1:09:07] that you have for the Brethren amen
[1:09:11] hallelujah you can impersonate
[1:09:14] it but I as as I said last night it's
[1:09:18] just like a black bird putting peup
[1:09:21] peacock feathers in his wings and saying
[1:09:23] see I'm a peacock yeah
[1:09:27] he just added them and pushed them
[1:09:30] in if there's something on the inside of
[1:09:33] him made him push them out he would
[1:09:37] actually be a peacock certainly but some
[1:09:41] people are trying to do something to
[1:09:43] look like somebody else or impersonate
[1:09:47] somebody else because they thought they
[1:09:50] did it and you see what it does it
[1:09:54] brings us back back to a ritual and form
[1:09:59] again it's the
[1:10:01] blood the life that electrifies and
[1:10:05] sanctifies your
[1:10:08] life that's
[1:10:10] right Hallelujah we will all come before
[1:10:13] the Judgment seat of
[1:10:16] Christ and be judged according to the
[1:10:18] things done in the body right that's
[1:10:21] right Hallelujah I believe this is true
[1:10:24] compassion right you can be
[1:10:26] compassionate to other people but most
[1:10:28] especially to people of like Precious
[1:10:32] Faith amen people that are part of the
[1:10:35] body remember you cannot impersonate it
[1:10:38] unless you have the Holy Ghost unless
[1:10:40] you have the genui agap love living in
[1:10:43] you you cannot manifest
[1:10:46] it Hallelujah you cannot have true
[1:10:50] compassion for others people that are
[1:10:53] suffering unless you have the holy
