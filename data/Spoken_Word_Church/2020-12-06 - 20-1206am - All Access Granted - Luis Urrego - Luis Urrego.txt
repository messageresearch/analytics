navy amen when you they they you have to make your bed every time you get up in the morning you have to and for those who have been in the army you know that that's the truth and but they don't do

amen for giving us the opportunity to to minister his word this morning i i just want to um go ahead and go to the word this morning i i'm going to try not to keep you too long and i want to talk about this morning about a little thought that i just called out all access granted all access granted and uh we're gonna talk a little bit about the tree of life amen praise god so let's read in genesis chapter two and before we do that let's just bow our heads and uh remember brother wade and brother dallas they're traveling later [Music] later today almighty god we just thank you lord for the opportunity that you've given us lord jesus to open back the pages of your word lord father god the fact lord that that you brought us here lord jesus to hear your word lord tells us lord god almighty that you have something in store for us lord and so we ask you father god this day lord jesus that you'd help us to have our ears open and and ready lord and willing lord god to hear what you have in store for us lord lord we are only going to receive father god what we put into the service lord if we come here father god with a negative spirit lord god we're only going to see negativity but if we come here lord god with a spirit lord god to hear to learn and to father god to receive a blessing lord then we are going to receive a blessing lord jesus we ask you father god that you would help us father god i'm insufficient within myself lord i cannot speak lord god these wonderful truths in your word but only through you father so i pray that you anoint my lips lord god and you speak directly to those needs father god here amongst us for those needs amongst your people lord god the bride is the the most needy people lord jesus and we just ask you father god that you would just be in our midst lord this morning father be just blessed brother wade blessed brother dale as they travel keep them and watch over them and bring them back home safely lord we pray and you anoint your word i believe brother wade is the one ministering this morning there at the church and i just pray lord that you would help him and strengthen my brother and just bless the people there in the congregation father through your word we commit these things into your hands now in the lovely name of the lord jesus christ amen amen praise the lord jesus genesis chapter 2 genesis chapter 2 verse 4 through 9 and then we'll read verses 15 and 17 of the same chapter and then we'll go through revelations chapter 2 verse 7. bible says here genesis 2 4 these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day that the lord god made the earth and the heavens and every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew for the lord god had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there was not a man to till the ground but there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life amen and man became a living soul and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight all right and the good for food and and then it says notice that there's a differentiation there these trees right here at the beginning are good for food but then now this one this tree here says the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil so to me it sounds like it's just these these are the tree of life is is something the tree of good and evil is something and then the trees they're good for food that's something else amen praise god and the lord god took the man at verse 15 and the lord god took the man and put him in the gar into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat watch but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die amen and we'll stop right there uh rev let's just skip down to revelations chapter 2 verse 7. revelations 2 verse 7 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life amen which is in the midst of the paradise of god praise the lord you may be seated this morning amen amen as we were reading these scriptures you notice that in all all of these trees that were mentioned they are all trees that you eat off of but some amen are trees that you eat off of physically and some are trees that you eat off of spiritually amen now you can eat you can eat from the from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil amen just as much as you can eat from the tree of life amen you can you can you can eat from that tree amen uh and you will live by that tree or you will die from that by that tree depends on just what tree you're eating you see amen so but in all these trees amen you are you have you you you you can eat off of amen in other words because i'm going to get to something here just a moment in other words you choose how you want to live your life you choose how you want to serve if you want to serve the lord or not god does not make you do anything in your life he does not force you amen it's your choice amen just as much as it was a choice for eve and for adam there in the garden of eden amen god has given us that same free will in this day amen you chose this morning to get up amen from from your bed amen from that comfortable bed warm bed warm pillow a man that you had and it was cold outside you chose this morning and said i'm going to the house of god amen because i want to hear the word not because brother dale was not going to be there or not no amen you chose to come to the house of god because you wanted to hear the word amen amen not a man a motivation from a man not a motivation from anything else but the word was the one who should have motivated you amen praise god and if that motivation is not in you amen then today is the day that you can receive that motivation amen some people ask you man how in the world can you get so happy about god and excited about god well get god in your life and you know get god in your life amen and you'll know why it makes you happy why why it excites you amen because why you've done the things of the world you've tried the things of of this life you've done those things amen you've noticed that that only brings temporary satisfaction and now amen the only true thing that i can say amen that that has brought true satisfaction in my life and an enjoyment and a hope and a peace in my life amen is the word of god amen jesus christ who is the word amen praise god and i hope that you feel the same way because without him saints we are nothing without him amen as the sun goes we would surely fall praise god amen so i wanted to title this all access uh all access granted amen you know sometimes when we uh how many have seen that phrase or seen that that that that that line or or or heard it amen uh some of us who work with computers say man we we we like when when we see that all access granted or when when it's when you're clear to go to a certain place or to enter into a certain room or a certain or a certain area amen to have all access and so when you're on a computer and you're working in a computer and you have to put in a password amen you uh if you don't put in the wrong if you put in the wrong password you're not gonna get access to everything that's in store there you know nowadays we have uh a lot of subscription services nowadays uh online you know you can have subscriptions for example to netflix you know not that i have that but uh you can have access you can have access to netflix uh you see now some of these companies they give you limited access if you don't pay them you can watch uh netflix is a place where you can watch movies and uh you might get maybe a free trial to only just and you have limited access but when you pay them and now you create that login and that password and when you pay them now you put in your password and then you get full access to everything that they offer and i i don't recommend you get netflix account by the way but i'm just giving that as an example amen some of these places are getting corrupt and corrupt by the day they got agendas they got agendas those things in there anyways that's another topic for another but you have access now to the full lineup of what they offered you see and how how it is so today in the spiritual saints amen that god has given us not limited access to his blessings not limited access to his word amen but full access in this hour for you to enjoy everything that he has to offer through his word amen praise god yes and it was granted amen god had that's the reason why god had to send the message in this day that's why god had to do what he had to do send us a prophet in this day amen to provide to give us the way amen so that we could have full access to the things of god amen it's been laying in the word all these years but man had been probing here and there trying this password trying this password what does this mean what does this mean and maybe seeing a little bit here and there amen but today amen as message believers amen we have full access to the kingdom of god in this hour now if you don't want to if you don't know about the word you don't know what this message talks about that's uh that's that's that's your fault it's not god's fault the message has been here the word has been open the book has been opened amen it's because you don't get into it amen and so or i don't get into it you see sometimes amen we allow ourselves to become the very thing to prevent us from accessing the blessings of god we ourselves we are our worst enemy we're our worst stumbling block amen us ourselves praise god so we have no excuse in this hour amen we have full access today to the full blessings of god now the word access uh the definition of the word access i'll just read you these definitions it says permission liberty or ability to enter approach or pass to and from a place or to approach or communicate with a person or thing amen a permission praise god it's a freedom or ability to obtain or make use of something amen now we love we we love freedom amen here in america we we where we love freedom we we were founded upon those those those uh foundations of freedom and liberty you see it's something that's very dear to us amen and that and god created us to be free man free women amen praise praise god so we like freedom we like that access access to to everything freedom or ability to obtain or make use of something a way or means of entering or approaching amen a way or means of entering or approaching do you believe that jesus christ has made the way not only has he made a way but he is the way the bible says that he is the way the truth and the life and no man comes to the father except through him praise god you want full access to the blessings of god you want full access to the to the word of god to understand the word amen you do it through jesus christ amen there's no other way to understand the word but by his spirit amen again if you have the spirit of something else in your life a spirit of a singer or a spirit of of some a rock star or some rap star you're going to act like that person but if the spirit of god is in you if the spirit of jesus christ who god raised from the dead dwells in you it will quicken your mortal body you will act like jesus christ you will live like jesus christ you will you will you will think like jesus christ amen i like that concept because it's it's an easy concept to understand amen so if somebody says they're a christian and they acting like somebody else outside of christ you got to question that do they really have the spirit of christ dwelling in them amen praise god now what is the tree of life and we're reading here about the tree of life and so the phrase the tree of life you you find it in the bible only six times only six times you find that phrase the tree of life now there's there's uh uh and you find it three times in the book of genesis and three times in the book of revelation that's interesting the phrase the the phrase the tree of life now there's other places in the bible where you see where it says a tree of life amen for example uh in in proverbs chapter 11 verse 30 it says the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life and he that when his souls is wise proverbs 15 4 says a wholesome tongue is a tree of life but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit but the phrase the phrase the tree of life is only found six times in the bible now six we know is the number is the number of men you see if you know the numerology of god for example three the number three represents perf uh uh perfection amen the number five represents grace the number seven represents completion the number eight represents eternal life or a new day or resurrection you see so it's it's it there's the numerology of god is is very important now it's interesting that the tree of life that phrase the tree of life is found in the two books that satan hates the most it's found in genesis and in revelation which is the two books that are attacked the most by man today and for us as christians we uh sometimes nominal christians uh uh don't have that try to probe here and there what does the book of revelation mean what does it mean about a seal what does it mean about a beast that rose up from the waters what does all that mean and because they don't understand it because the revelation hasn't come to them they just kind of leave it alone and just don't even preach about it don't even touch it amen that's and it's it's nothing but satan trying to bring him from a revelation that god god wants to give them amen that's how i was when i was in in in the nominal churches you know and but when god opens that thing to you amen when god reveals his word to amen you'll never be the same again you'll never see the word of god in the same light that you've seen it amen praise god so it's mentioned three times in the in the book of genesis and three times in the book of revelation six times in total amen and we know that the number six represents the number of man so that means that this phrase the tree of life is has a relation to man there's a relation there to man amen we're going to see about this the prophet says have you ever noticed how satan hates two books of the bible more than all others through liberal theologians and pseudoscientists he is always attacking the book of genesis and the book of revelation in both of these books we find satan's origin this is why satan hates it because in both of these books we find satan's origin his awful ways and his destruction satan is is on the rampage especially today because he knows he's his hand is coming soon and so he does not want to he he's already made his choice yes he's already made his choice he's already done what he's doing amen so he's just going all out and we see it represented in all these presidents and governors and stuff like man they're just going all out now we find satan's origin his awful ways and his destruction that is why he attacks them he hates to be exposed and in this book and in those books he is exposed for exactly what he is amen that's what sometimes when when a preacher is ministering and all of a sudden he's preaching on something that's hitting your life a little bit either you start you start getting mad and you start getting because if you have that devil that demon sitting there on you anointing you anointing that in your life he's being exposed and he hates it he hates being exposed praise god but he needs exposure amen so that you can see fully who he is and so that way you could kick him out of your life amen because if you don't know what's there to kick amen you won't be able to kick him out of your life amen but when you see him in plain view amen you know exactly what you need to take care of in your life praise god jesus said about satan he has no part in me and i have no part in him the devil would like to prove that different but he cannot so he does all he can to destroy confidence in the word and we see that today amen we see it in even in our very ranks but when the church disbelieves satan and believes the spirit's revelation of the word the gates of hell cannot prevail against her amen praise god so when you lay to the side of the word amen and you hear what the spirit has to say amen that ex that exposes satan that the gates of hell as the prophet said here cannot prevail against you so six times this phrasal tree of life is mentioned in the bible and um now i'm skipping down here so this tree has always had a relation to man amen and in all six of these places the this this phrase the tree of life signifies the same thing and doesn't ever signify anything different it signifies the same thing or in this case the same person praise god amen so before we see this uh uh tree of life i want to read here some scriptures where where god refers to man as trees amen in psalms chapter 1 verse 3 very familiar scripture to us it says blessed is the man i'm sorry psalm chapter 1 verse 1 2 3 blessed is the man that walketh not in the council of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the sea of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night and he shall be look what the bible says and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water amen that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper amen so there is there is an example there of god typing man with a tree praise god mark 8 24 another familiar scripture where jesus came and healed a blind man and when his eyes were open they asked him what he saw and the blind man said and he looked up and said i see man as trees walking amen i see man as trees walking so so many times in the bible uh where where trees are mentioned is a representation of man praise god so therefore if we are represented as man in the scripture then this tree of life that it talks about in genesis and that we read about in revelation must mean that it's a person as well must mean that is a is a it's a it's a it's a is an individual as well praise god and so if this tree of life is a person amen then the tree of the knowledge of good and evil must be a person as well amen yes because remember there was a differentiation there there was a differentiation of the trees that they could eat that adam and eve could eat and enjoy you see of the fruit of those trees but then now it comes to a tree of life in the midst of the garden in other words it was in the midst it was there the his presence was there but so was satan's presence now it goes back to the things that brother wade has been preaching about the two about the twins about the two the two spirits you see because wherever wherever jesus christ is satan is on the scene as well amen wherever there was a jesus there was a there was a judas amen wherever there was wherever god is amen satan is present there not to create something originally because satan cannot create but to copy what god has already done or to or to uh corrupt it that's why he has man the way he has him today and man is acting the way he is today it's a corruption it because man wants wants to worship man wants uh uh wants to worship god wants to serve a god he knows that there's a being there's something out there greater than he himself but satan comes in and interrupts that and and and and and corrupts that and gives them a lust or or and perverts that lust or perverts that thirst sorry perverts that thirst for god to the things of the world towards politics towards movies towards cigarettes towards alcohol towards sex towards all these things amen he perverts each and every one he perverts that thirst for god for all these other things and when you and when you and when you've had your share of all those things you realize you're still empty you're still empty and there but and you'll you cannot receive full satisfaction until you get to the tree of life amen i've been there done that i know many of you have as they say i've gotten the t-shirt the hat and the mouse pad to go with it nothing satisfies like the word of god in this hour young people nothing satisfies nothing satisfies like god amen now i've failed him many times and sometimes i don't do what i'm supposed to do amen but i tell you what there's nothing in me amen nothing in nothing in this world would ever cause me to disbelieve this word god help me amen because where like peter said where else could i go he's the only one that has the words of eternal life jesus christ peter knew it he peter said where else could we go lord you're the only one who's showing us the way amen and where else could we go amen thank you praise god there's no so so this person this tree of life must mean that it's a person it's it must be a person of life or the person of life amen and we know that the only person of life the author the originator of life is the lord jesus christ amen there is there's no original life in in anything else amen there's no original life in politics there's no original life in in in in in a president there's no original life in in in anything in this hour amen outside of the word praise god those things only bring amen just a temporal pleasure and when that excitement goes away then what you're empty that's the reason why a drug addict continues to take drugs because he's he that that that that weed smoking or whatever he's doing whatever drug he's taking that high is only for a temporary you see it's only for just a day or two right and then he's out looking and see see what he can sell or seeing what he can steal from somebody to sell so that he could go get more because he wants to feel the exact same way again amen but with the holy spirit in your life eternal life in your soul amen you can feel that high and more amen every single moment of your day amen if you choose to if you choose to feel it and it's not through some smoking it's not through some shooting up it's through the word of god coming to church being around the brethren amen that gets me high know about you that gets me high and man and it's a good high gets me higher above looking up where my redemption is drawing now amen praise god amen now john chapter six through eight uh we see there uh that jesus he declares himself there to be the source of eternal life amen just to just to point back amen we haven't lost our thought yet all access granted amen but there in john chapter 6 through 8 jesus declares himself to be the source of eternal life jesus there in those chapters calls himself the bread of heaven and the water of life and that if you ate from from him you would live forever now how how many would want that amen i i i i want that i mean i don't know who who doesn't want to i mean even portray it in the movies amen uh to for man to want to live forever to live to have eternal life to get access to something where they don't ever have to die anymore but the way they portray it is a perverted way the way god's portrayed it amen throughout the word amen is the true and only way amen praise god it's the true and only way now first john chapter 6 verse 35 jesus says and it says here and jesus said unto them i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger amen and he that believeth on me shall never thirst now he was not talking about physical hunger and physical thirst there he was talking about a spiritual hunger and a spiritual thirst amen that hunger in that thirst that i was just speaking about that man come to this world with and they get and they're perverted to do other things amen that's the hunger and thirst that jesus can fulfill that he's talking about here john 6 1 51 says i am the living bread which came down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live forever so the the the prescription is right there in the word it's just satan tries to keep our our our eyes away from the word to something else don't think that the word of god saints is only for the preacher to read that's right don't think that the word of god is only for just uh some scholar or some uh uh no the word of god is for you to read from the youngest to the oldest amen the message of the hour is for you to get in in it from the youngest to the oldest it's not just for the minister the pastor or the deacon amen it's for you amen you that's why this is an individual relationship between you and christ amen this is not a group access this is an individual access amen to this tree of life you've got to do your part in order for him to do his part and you say oh why can i see i don't see god i don't see i don't see god moving in my life i don't see god i want to see greater things in my life but what are you putting into the access are you what are you putting into it a man to get out of it you see that's why i said at the beginning what are you putting into the service amen in order for you to get out of the service amen whatever you put into the service that's what you'll get out of amen if you come here to criticize you're going to get some critics critical spirit amen you come here amen to say lord i want that word that's going forth to change me forget the man that's saying and forget the the preacher that's preaching it i want that word to come in me and change me from the way that i'm living today lord we live in perilous times we're living in troubleless times things are happening insecure insecurities are taking place unsure things are happening but god you're the only source of light you're the only protector in my life you're the only true source of joy in my life amen so i'm going there amen to receive some strength praise god and so jesus declaring about eternal life in first john chapter 5 verse 11 11-12 and it says there and this is the record that god hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his son amen not in anybody else his this life is in his son this life is not in president trump this life is not in joe biden this life is not in anybody else that's right there's no life in that i'm sorry to tell you i'm sorry i've crushed your dreams but i didn't crush them the bible did and you as a believer should know better all this stuff getting into politics and all these things amen you should know better than that and getting on facebook and things and and and becoming a politician yourself especially some of your sisters being politicians on facebook amen knowing amen that you should you should be you're not going to change anybody with that that's right the only way you're going to change somebody is with the word of god amen when you when you come in with the word of god amen that changes that helps somebody that gives hope to somebody amen but with the politics no it doesn't give hope to anybody amen praise god i don't know how i got into that lord help us he that hath the son hath life amen and he that hath not the son of god hath not life i just plain as black as day i mean black and white amen he that hath the son hath life not he that hath the president have life but he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the son of god hath not life so the question is do you want the son of god in your life so that you can have full access to eternal life i want full access in this hour praise god amen how many love the lord are you still with me amen amen again i'm going to try to keep my word i'm not going to keep you now we see in genesis chapter 2 there in verse 8 and 9. let's just read this real quick and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food see then he goes and immediately it says the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil amen so we see that there in the in the garden there was two trees standing there amen in the midst of it amen so as we said earlier if this tree of life is a person then logically this tree of knowledge of good and evil must be a person as well amen praise god this tree of good and evil if we if we if we know that the tree of life is christ amen let's just bring it down we know that as believers amen we know that that tree of life was christ amen christ was there amen adam and eve had access amen to to christ whenever because the bible says that he was in the midst of the garden in other words they could the bible says that god come down amen would come down and fellowship with them in the in the cool of the evening amen but it wasn't just then it wasn't just then amen it was they had access to him at all times amen praise god it wasn't just in the cool of the evening amen that's why amen you don't have access to god just here when you come to church amen or just on a wednesday amen you have access to him every time maybe no matter where you are amen you can be in the middle of the woods in the woods uh hunting but you have full access to him there amen praise god because he is the same yesterday to them forever and he's omniscient and he's omnipresent amen praise god and so this tree of good and evil is none other than satan himself that's right satan himself was in the garden and if you want scripture to back that up you just read ezekiel chapter 28 verse 13. the bible says talking about satan it says thou has been in eden the garden of god every precious stone was thy covering the sardius topaz and the diamond the barrel the onyx and the jasper the sapphire the emerald and the carbuncle and gold the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou was created so satan was in there was there in the garden of eden and he is he is beautiful you see as we just read he is not anything ugly he doesn't have horns like the way they portray him in the in the movies or in the cartoons he is a beautiful angel a beautiful being the bible in another place calls him an angel of light i thought god was the source of light he is the source of light the originator of light but he can he can he can imitate himself and turn himself the bible says into an angel of light and he's turned himself to an angel light to many people today amen people thinking that that's god fooling them fooling them and thinking and thinking that they're worshiping god when they're actually doing satan a service doesn't the bible say that man that would come to a point where they're killing you you know persecuting you thinking that they're doing god a service when in reality they're serving god i mean satan and they're serving satan amen satan is not any satan is not going to come at you like a like like a demon uh uh you know like a zombie looking type person he's not going to come at you that way he's going to come at you with something very nice very subtle subtle and and very soft-spoken very very meek very gentle he's not going to come bashing you in the head with anything his no he that's how he comes and that's how problems start in your life when you give access to satan in your life it's little by little that's why that that's why the phrase you give him you give him a finger he takes the whole arm you give you give satan his little finger he takes the whole thing because he's not satisfied with just your pinky little finger he wants he wants all of you but god also wants the same thing and so with with god he only he only can use what you give him you give him your pinky that's all he can use but you give him your whole life amen he uses your whole your whole being amen i don't know why we don't want to just give him our whole being we just give him just a little part of our life amen we give him just a little lord you can come into this door in my life but don't come in here this is first for me this is just i you leave that alone and you know what you're telling god god you have limited access amen when when god himself has given us full access to every blessing amen praise god praise the lord jesus so satan doesn't come at you he comes at you very sly and until he gets you to full destruction and then you realize what in the world have i done what in the world where why wh where am i at praise god now so we see that those two trees were there in the garden and man was to live by the tree of life adam was to live by that tree by that tree by the tree of life amen they were had fellowship with that tree of life on a daily basis amen praise god the prophet says here in in the ephesian churches god's intention for his creation man is to express his words in genesis adam was given the word to live by amen in other words to give in that tree of life to live by yes you see a life lived by the word would be the word expressed let me say that again a life lived by the word would be the word expressed when you live the word of god when you put the word of god into action that's the word expressed in your life amen and who is the word is jesus christ that is true is it not but did adam live by that word no because he was to live by every word and he failed to take heed to every word amen to every word how important it is amen when you leave something off when you leave something off from the word amen you don't have access to the full word you see just one word off is not full access just one word off amen it's limited access praise god and that's what satan wants us to to have his limited acts he doesn't care if you come to church he doesn't care if you read the bible amen it may seem that you have full access to the word because you have a bible in your house and you have a bible on your phone and you have a bible on your ipad it may seem that you have full access but full access amen is when you when that with the revelation of that word comes into your life amen that's getting into full access then praise god amen the church ages amen it was limited access to at the church ages amen but the full access through the holy spirit amen was right there full access to the word to all the blessings that god has for you amen that's what we are at in this hour that's where we are at in this hour amen to full access to his blessings amen so we are to be living by every word of god in order to truly be the word expressed amen and that was the purpose of god amen it was to share his eternal life with man in ephesians chapter one it talks about how uh in verse four four through eleven i don't wanna i'm not gonna read it all but just take certain points it says there that according as he had chosen us in him amen that we should be holy and without blame before him in love he wanted to share that love with us he wanted to share that eternal life with with adam with eve amen he gave them a man eternal life in their soul yes right amen but they did not have eternal life in their body amen think of that think about that for a moment if in there having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself amen wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins look at all these axes all that we have access to he hath abounded toward us having made note unto us the mystery of his will in other words it's not a mystery anymore it's an open book amen he might that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him amen all things not just limited things all things he might gather unto him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated amen praise god that's how much god wants to give you full access he's done it all yeah now what are you treating no what are you doing we have no excuse in this hour i'm getting a little warm here praise god you love the lord i mean are still with me amen praise god now so i want you to keep that in mind that adam did not have eternal life in his body that's the reason why he had to con he had to keep eating from the tree of life that's the reason why he had to continually fellowship with the word with jesus christ with god the tree of life in order to come to that point amen he had he had eternal life in his soul but not in his body amen so what happened they got ahead of the word and we know the story amen they got ahead of the word amen and they did amen they disobeyed the word that's why they didn't take the full word in their life amen and that's the reason why amen when you get ahead of god amen and no matter what it is in your life when you get ahead of the plan of god amen it leads you to destruction it leads you to death no matter what it is that's why it's so important amen that we commit things to the lord lord is it your will for me to do this yes amen is it for me to be your will for me to be in that church is it for me your will for me to have this job is it your will for me to to go this route amen to be with this person in my in my life is it your will lord because most of the time we want to get ahead of god and eventually getting ahead of god it leads us amen to to death it leads us to a life not with not satisfied to a life with no full access to god but there's forgiveness and there's there's there's grace and there's mercy amen but the scar will still be there how many how many know that that's amen i've i've been there the scar will still be there as a reminder not as a reminder that not not as a reminder necessarily of what happened but as a reminder of the grace and the mercy of god in your life amen amen praise god amen so and so adam and eve they reasoned with the word of god when the serpent came to eve and said you shall not surely die amen just one word off you see see just one word off and it was god it was satan giving eve thinking making eve think that she had full access when in reality it was limited access right amen and so when they the when they reasoned with the word of god amen i'm just trying to move along i can't believe time's going so fast when they were when they reasoned with the word of god amen it led them to death the bible says that that day amen they shall surely die when they sinned that same now they didn't die the same day no they didn't they didn't fall over dead you know when they partook amen of the sin of the unbelief no they they eventually their bodies started to die they started to get old when in reality they should they were not supposed to get to that point because if they would have continued eating from the tree of life their bodies would have been rejuvenating their bodies would have been amen and it's the same thing with you and i saints in this hour amen as we are partaking of the tree of life jesus christ the word amen that's amen that holy spirit is rejuvenating us amen from the inside out amen amen you may feel old on the outside but the spirit man inside is young amen sometimes they might feel so young like that man that brother brandon was talking about there that preached that 90 year old man that preached that sermon talking about the the the rainbow and how he preached there in job and where were you when i laid the foundation of the world and he got so excited 90 something years old and he just jumped up you know nobody i had there's no room enough here to for me to preach amen if the word of god can do that for a 94 year old man amen how much more man can it do for me how much more can it do for you michael how much more can he do for you zach praise god amen i want that same i want that same life i want that same spirit to rejuvenate me from the inside out amen the problem is is that we get tired and we get sleepy and we get bored with the things that god has for us we get so we have so much full access to the word nowadays that we get bored of it oh my we get bored i've heard that i've heard that ever since i was little i grew up in the message and you get bored of it and you don't realize the treasure that you have before you when you really realize what the treasures that you have before you amen you're not going to start experiencing exactly what the joy of the lord is in your life listen david had joy he said lord restore to me the joy of thy salvation that was with limited access that was with limit he didn't have the revelation of the seven seals he didn't have the revelation he didn't have the holy spirit in his life yeah he was talking about lord give restore to me the joy of my salvation and he was excited when the ark of god was coming down down the road amen and he got so excited he started dancing and amen until his clothes fell off the bible says that's right what should what what would the word of god what should the word of god do to us in this hour amen now i i don't want you to dance until your clothes fall off don't do that but i'll tell you what i've heard stories of people and i think brother branham talks about people got it getting excited in the spirit and they get so excited in the spirit and they and they'll and they'll be like a stove up a stove one of those hot stoves thing like you sister monica have in your in your house and they and they and they were holding the stove that hot pipe amen and they didn't even get burned so so into in the spirit that they got to that it didn't even get burned i've seen people getting in the spirit amen and the holy spirit amen just taking care of the sisters as maybe they fall on the floor amen or something like that just watching over their clothes nobody there making sure they're closing no the holy spirit just kind of takes care of that amen you see god could take care of amen the problem is we don't get in the spirit enough amen we like we like routines we like routines it's out of the routine we don't know but see the routine can lead you to death now when sometimes gets excited oh i don't know about that do you realize that's the spirit of a baptist church when you act that way spirit of a nominal church amen but let the holy spirit have free reign amen in your life if somebody gets excited about the word amen about the word of god in their life they must have heard the word first and god have the word in their life first before they can act that way amen i've i've been there done that amen i've i've been that way amen praise god now i don't know how i got into that but as brother wade said wednesday that didn't cost you anything praise god amen so sometimes we get ahead of the word amen ecclesiastes 3 1 tells us to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven everything has a time has a purpose amen so back to this tree of life the first adam he never obtained the eternal life for his body never due to his unbelief to the word and he lost access to the tree of life yes amen and so we see what happened there in genesis chapter 3 verse 22 through 24 it reads and the lord god said behold this is after adam and eve disbelieved the word sinned and the lord god said behold a man has become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever in other words god did not want them to eat from the tree of life to have access to the tree of life and they're in that condition sinful condition that they were in they had sin they disbelieved the word that's the reason why you and i saints we can't live we can't have full access to the tree of life and your life living in sin you say that you're a christian you say that you're born again and you're doing the things of the devil on the side you don't have access to the tree of life you don't have access to the full word of god you might come in here and play the part god bless you hey man but you don't have full access to the tree of life when in your heart you really want to do the things in the of the world you don't have full access don't tell me that you're a full blood you're you're a full christian amen you're you're there you're partly there amen but you can't have one foot in the in the world and one foot in the world in the in church it doesn't work that way amen maybe you came here to hear something else today hopefully this is helping somebody now therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground from once he was taken verse 24 genesis chapter 3 so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubims and the flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life so god was the one who placed cherubims there to the tree of life what does that mean in other words when adam and eve sinned god did not want them to have full access to the to to him anymore in that condition they had they had to have a man a a a a a redemption work done in their lives that's why god killed a lamp and and and and clothed them with skins of that lamb amen representing jesus christ well what he was going to do later on amen but then uh they but they lost access to that tree of life in its fullness amen and that's why they started getting old eventually they died they lived 960 something years adam did i think is how much he lived can you imagine living that long my it's probably it was better than than it was now than it is now i mean you get you getting out to 50 60 years old i'm sure right and you're probably like man imagine living 500 600 700 900 and something years that's a long time but eventually adam died when from the from the beginning it was not so they were not they were not to die if they stayed eating from the tree of life amen praise god amen so there was no way for them to have access to that tree of life amen in the in the old testament when god when god made the the tabernacle and and we have here we're not going to use this so just this is an example yeah they had access to the tabernacle of moses amen thee and inside was the ark of the covenant all right the tabernacle of moses amen had three layers to it amen the outer court the ho the the holy place and then the holy of holies in the holy of holies was this right here the tabernacle of god amen the the the the the ark the ark of the covenant amen and in that ark in in that tabernacle only one person could go in there only one person had access to it and they had to have the right password they had to have the right password to get in there they could not get in there with with with half of the password or the wrong password they had to have everything in order they had to be dressed a certain way they had to even smell a certain way that's how much god amen what god wanted them to be in there amen but they had to do it the way he said to him it's not the way you want it amen it's not the way you want to approach god no there but the bible says he is the only way he is the only truth he is the only life amen so when they got in there him and the priest the high priest would go in there with blood from an animal that was sacrificed and he would go in there and when he would go in there inside that holy of holies that that there was a there was a veil between the holy of holies and the holy place and in the ho and when he would go past that veil amen he had access because he had he had he had fulfilled everything that he was supposed to do and he would go in there and sprinkle the blood upon the upon the ark amen representing amen that here's lord hears blood to represent for the sins of the people and that was enough to cover them for a whole year and to represent for the for his his own sins as well now in that holy of holies saints amen was was so much the the the presence of god was so much in there amen there was there was the the the tablets of of of of moses the the word of god was in there the ten commandments was in there the the the aaron's rod amen who in that aaron's rod just think about the saints aaron's rod that was supposed to be a dry stick inside that presence was blooming amen inside that holy place inside that holy of holies was blooming and that and that branch that rod was not even attached to a tree think about that saints it was not even attached to a tree yet it was blooming but if you think about it it was attached to the tree because the tree of life was in there jesus christ his presence was in there and so aaron could go back in there the high priest could go back in there and see that not only that go back in there and partake of the manna the original manna that god had given them at the beginning when he started sending manna to them he could partake of that original manna in there and take some of that manna and eat to remind him lord this is the foundation for where we are right now amen and you and i have access to all these things to the original manna amen to the original word to the to the to the whole holiest of holies now aaron or the high priest was the only one that had access to that but when jesus christ came on the scene the high priest of our confession amen the the high priest amen the the the one that's why he died and he took and he shed his own blood his own life amen and when he did amen and that earthquake took place the veil was rent from top to bottom that veil was ramped from top to bottom so now nobody had an excuse to not go back in there now it's death if you don't go back in there it was death if you went in there because only aaron could go in there but now it's death if you don't go back in there so now you have full access to this tree of life in this hour praise god aren't you happy for that amen you have full access to the tree of life in this hour and now amen you don't have to it's not just about seeing an aaron's rod or it's not just about seeing and taking some man amen but now you can have the revelation of the seven seals now you can see amen those two spirits amen working in in tanzania now you can see amen what the church ages are about now you can see all these things why because there's full access to to that to that place amen praise god so that's why that second adam that's why jesus christ is called the second adam because it was the second adam jesus christ the word he came himself to do what adam failed to do adam failed to to to believe all the word of god but jesus christ came on the scene amen to to believe and to obey the full word of god because he is the word and i know a lot of you that you already know this amen amen but some of you amen this might help you amen praise god so jesus he defeated the enemy by the word amen he died and resurrected in order to obtain eternal life for his own body you see and for our souls and our bodies as well amen and he was the only one that could do it he was the only one that could give you the the full pat the full the password to have full access to it amen when he raised from the dead amen that's when he came up and he says access granted full acts is granted amen he said it about himself he says all heaven and earth amen uh is is given unto me amen and now the same thing he gives to you amen romans 6 5 for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection praise god romans 6 8 now if we be dead with christ we believe that we shall also live with him amen because he lives i can face tomorrow amen this is what makes the christian life worth wow because he died and resurrected amen then you can live as well amen colossians 3 1 if he then be risen with christ watch this if you then be risen with christ seek those things which are above amen amen where christ sitteth on the right hand of god so seek those things in other words pay attention to those things not to these things out here because these things are going to perish they're going to be destroyed amen so that so today we have the promise of not just receiving eternal life in our soul but also eternal life in our bodies think about this saints jesus christ raised from the dead in order to obtain eternal life for his body because as jesus christ was living here on earth and walking here on earth he didn't have eternal life on his body he had he was he was god yes full he had he had full access the fullness of the god had bodily dwelled in him but he didn't have ac eternal life on his body man it wasn't until he raised from the dead in that glorified form but now saints we have the promise today that we don't even have to die amen we don't even have to die amen and we have access to that full resurrection amen in our lives from the inside out in other words a full body change i know i keep talking about the body changing this hour because it's becoming a greater thing for me than it ever has before amen and it should be to you too as well because that's the thing that we're facing right now the resurrection i'm not looking forward to joe biden getting in the presidency or donald trump winning the election that's not what i'm looking i'm looking for a resurrection amen to see those dead saints raised from the dead and we know that we only have about 30 40 days left after that that's right yes sir amen yes sure it's okay you keep up with the news and all that good stuff that's fine but that's limited that's limited access actually that's no access at all that's not going to get you to glory what gets me the glory is this word amen this word is the only thing that can transform my body and if it was enough to transform my soul a man they can transform this body amen praise god so that that way of the tree of life has been restored in this hour saints it's been restored and now amen we're looking forward to great things to happen in our midst to happen in our lives to see great things amen we have so much of the word that's still not been fulfilled it's mostly in revelation and you know in isaiah in different places there's still word to be fulfilled but only the bride are going to be able to see that word fulfilled amen praise god the prophet says but there are no cherubims with flaming swords to guard the tree of life now you see when that cherubim was placed there to guard the tree of life when adam and eve sinned and were kicked out of the garden those cherubims aren't there anymore you have full access to that to that tree of life now and if you don't want to eat the fruit from that tree amen it's your fault it's not god's fault amen it's your own fault revelations 2 7 reading again what we just read this morning he the hat and ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the church is to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life amen in order for you to be an overcomer and the overcomer there is something that you must overcome you want to be an overcomer then overcome something what is the greatest thing that you need to overcome in your life you know it god knows it overcome overcome but the the beautiful thing is that when we get the spirit of god in our lives amen that makes us just as much overcomer as he is as he did because he raised from the dead amen he triumphed from the death hell and the grave and if that same spirit dwells in you amen it makes you just as much as an overcomer as he is in other words it gives you the strength to overcome whatever it is that you're trying to overcome amen can i make it even more simpler so get his spirit in your life and you have access full access to overcome whatever it is that you want to overcome laziness uh uh you know stealing or you know smoking whatever whatever it is you have full access to overcome praise god amen romans 8 11 says but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you amen praise god you see we have access to fully overcome whatever it is in our life you know in in our in in the day and hour that we live in we give trophies to everybody who just participates i like what it was somebody uh there's actually a cartoon character in the movie said we celebrate mediocrity when god is he has no second place winners or third place winners or fourth place winners we do we give a trophy because you participated we don't want to leave anybody behind that's just being mediocre amen god doesn't want mediocre people god wants somebody amen who is a no true overcomer amen and if there's something if you want to be an overcomer that means there has to be something for you to overcome amen that's the reason why people acting the way they acted they acting today out in the streets rioting and all this stuff they're acting like they they deserve things it's the spirit and the age that we're living in you may not like to hear this but that's exactly the spirit that these people have out here like they do we we deserve we we deserve this and when they didn't even work for it and they get upset at the man who who has worked hard for it and has got to that place and they're trying to go in there wanting the same thing kicking windows out and burning buildings that's right you think they deserve that when the man that has worked hard for it and has labored and studied and done what he was supposed to do to obtain the same thing amen that's to me that's communism okay i don't know what i'm gonna get into that amen that's exactly the spirit of communism that everybody gets equal equal share in everything it doesn't matter if this person worked hard for it or if this person is just a lazy bum everybody gets equal share that's exactly where this country's heading right now as a matter of fact it's there right now full set communism god is not interested in that god is interested in overcomers amen not mediocrity overcomers and if there's if you want to be an overcomer there's something for you to overcome there's something for you to do praise god amen so that process amen should be taking place now in your life amen that process of of you overcoming should be taking place now in your life as you're eating the word amen as you're feeding on the word in other words as you're coming to church with sincerity in your heart and say lord i want that word to change me from the inside out amen then that word can change you from the inside out praise god but if it's just another church service for you then that word won't do anything for you i i challenge you saints to take the things that are preached from behind the pulpit any pulpit and go read them and study them on your own amen don't just don't just take you know our word for it amen read and study on your own get into the word yourself because i i promise you you will get more of god that way do you pray there's many times that i've prayed and i've even gotten a revelation from god as i'm praying and i didn't i wasn't in a church service i wasn't reading the bible at the moment i was just praying i was just talking to god and god all of a sudden put something in there because that's why the bible says that the lord knows exactly the spirit knows exactly what we need to pray amen and sometimes he intercedes for us amen praise god amen and i want to finish with this in revelations chapter 10 my goodness the time goes by fast do you love the lord amen aren't you thankful for having full access in this hour yes sir praise god revelation chapter 10 talks about us eating the word amen eating the open book amen god has opened up this book to us in all fullness all pages are not sticking there's no pages that's sticking amen it's it's it's it's it's full access to the word and the bible says there in revelation chapter 10 that that the mighty angel which is jesus christ came down with an open book and gave it to john and told him amen to eat it to eat not just a portion of it not just the parts that he likes kind of like some like little kids when you give them food and they don't like a certain they don't like the onions they leave the onions aside yeah my daughters they man they would leave they would have a little pile of onions right there on the side and they didn't like the onions but they eat the rest or they don't like the tomatoes they leave the little pile of tomatoes on the side amen but you see god this there's so many ingredients in the word and when you just take it all in then you really can taste what what you really can you really can know what you're eating amen but when you just say uh lord i don't like that the word says uh that i'm supposed to congregate you know go
