[11:07] we know where to find him
[11:09] this world's looking for peace we have
[11:11] the Principe this world's looking for
[11:16] um a stability oh my goodness they ain't
[11:19] gonna find it here
[11:20] but if they'll find it as as I was
[11:23] telling brother Bob
[11:25] um
[11:26] that was that today
[11:29] in Bible study in Sunday school class
[11:33] was a masterpiece
[11:38] that is how you teach Sunday school
[11:42] class amen and the subject he taught
[11:44] that was wonderful because the kids
[11:45] weren't up here praise the Lord anyhow
[11:49] y'all have to explain that not me
[11:52] but it's the truth anyhow I mean listen
[11:55] if you think fruit is what got us in the
[11:57] shape we're in you are totally deceived
[12:01] by the Devil Himself amen amen
[12:04] amen and it's hard to talk about some of
[12:06] the things that we do talk about but it
[12:08] only makes sense I was talking to a a
[12:12] person up in Ohio last weekend and uh
[12:15] he's just like uh he's like you know
[12:18] it's like he's got that deer in the
[12:19] headlights look
[12:21] and I said look let me let me ask you
[12:23] something I said
[12:24] what gives you more problems than
[12:26] anything
[12:28] bottom line what gives you the most
[12:30] problem
[12:31] it's either a man or a woman
[12:35] oh y'all don't have that problem well I
[12:37] do and Jim's at home she's not at home
[12:39] she's over her daddy so I can say this
[12:40] she's 200 miles away
[12:44] my greatest problem is me though but
[12:46] what is the greatest problem that we
[12:48] have to face is the lust of the flesh
[12:50] doesn't matter if you can put a white
[12:52] you know A to Z on it the lust of the
[12:54] flesh is what the problem is that's why
[12:56] it started in the Garden of Eden not
[12:58] less than after Apples because I ate one
[13:00] last night and I still got my problems
[13:03] it's on my Weight Watchers program so I
[13:05] can eat all the apples I want and it has
[13:07] not turned me into a better person it
[13:09] may make me skinnier brother George Well
[13:11] skinny ain't in my vocabulary but uh it
[13:14] may make me feel good
[13:16] but I promise you what happened in the
[13:18] garden
[13:19] ain't gonna happen again
[13:21] to a bride of Jesus Christ and actually
[13:24] I got that quote here that brother Bob's
[13:26] gonna have to quit preaching my sermons
[13:29] I'm gonna shut him down
[13:31] now that was truly a masterpiece today
[13:34] that was absolutely the truth and um
[13:37] like I said I was talking to that
[13:39] brother in Ohio he's not he's a brother
[13:41] but he's not a he's not a uh a Believer
[13:43] he uh
[13:45] he we were talking about genealogies and
[13:47] and all that and
[13:49] and I'm like dude they the Bible talks
[13:52] about genealogies right
[13:55] I mean they're so and so but guys so and
[13:57] so and so find me Cain and the lineage
[13:59] of anybody in the Bible
[14:02] not there
[14:04] because he was not of Adam he was of the
[14:07] Beast and then you go over there in the
[14:10] book of Jude it says it says Enoch being
[14:12] the seventh from Adam well if you go
[14:13] from Enoch and you start backing up
[14:15] seven generations
[14:17] if you put Cain in there the Bible's
[14:19] wrong
[14:20] all right so Cain was of that Wicked one
[14:22] he was serpent seed or the seed of the
[14:25] Beast and then he what he went off and
[14:28] went from the presence of God and that's
[14:30] what started the ball rolling all right
[14:32] so um let me make a few announcements uh
[14:35] brother Louise you'll be preaching
[14:37] Wednesday
[14:38] uh remember brother Joe and uh sister
[14:40] Rachel I'll be coming back from uh from

[14:49] her stepmom's grave which is in um
[14:53] Rochester Kentucky and they uh the
[14:56] archery shoot was in Owensboro which is
[14:57] just a few miles
[14:59] above it so they stopped by and and
[15:01] facetimed the gravesite for Jim so she
[15:04] could see it

[21:47] an effort to get up and put the good
[21:50] clothes on and eat them a meal and drive
[21:52] to Church Father we pray now that you
[21:54] would
[21:55] do one thing not let it return a void
[21:57] not let it be just a place to sit and
[22:00] make up time and and waste time Lord
[22:03] this is you this is eternal this is
[22:07] salvation this is redemption this is all
[22:10] the things that the Bible's told us
[22:12] about we've come down now to the end
[22:13] time and father let us as they say in
[22:16] the world ratchet our game up just a
[22:18] little bit Lord let us sharpen our
[22:20] pencil as that Capstone gets closer and
[22:23] closer it gets more narrower and more
[22:25] narrow Lord I pray that you just bless
[22:27] each one that's sick the ones that are
[22:28] not with us Lord just bless the ones
[22:31] that are in a foreign field Lord doing

[22:41] a service brother Jason Watkins brother
[22:42] Donnie's down there preaching I pray
[22:44] they should bless them Father just take
[22:46] care of us and lead us and guide us by
[22:47] your Holy Spirit today Lord you come and
[22:49] speak to the people father and move me
[22:51] out of the way in Jesus name we pray
[22:52] amen Bible says in the beginning was the
[22:56] word the word was with God and the Word
[22:57] was God and that word was
[23:01] there was a transition change
[23:04] the word was the theophany god that was
[23:06] the Creator God that was the logos and
[23:10] that logos then became flesh because as
[23:14] logos he couldn't die for us
[23:17] as Jehovah he couldn't die for us but as
[23:21] Jesus Christ that took on human form he
[23:24] died for us though he can be our Kinfolk
[23:26] he can be our Kinsmen Redeemer and then
[23:29] what happens now he has transferred that
[23:31] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[23:33] us and we beheld his glory to glory the
[23:34] only begotten the father full of grace
[23:36] and truth now that word is being made
[23:37] flesh where in you and me and you Jesus
[23:40] is not hearing flesh but he has
[23:42] commissioned us to take on
[23:45] him in human flesh you may be seeing the
[23:47] Lord has blessing to the reading of the
[23:49] word let's read second Peter and for the
[23:51] ones that have been here we've been
[23:54] talking on the Statue of a perfect man
[23:56] according to II Peter 1 verse 5 it says
[23:59] and besides this in other words besides
[24:02] your new birth giving all diligence or
[24:05] fervor or or or you know you look at
[24:08] these people online and you watch them
[24:10] uh watch a football game and they you
[24:12] know it's two degrees outside and they
[24:14] got no shirt on and they got their
[24:16] favorite team's name on their shirt on
[24:18] their chest
[24:19] that's fervor
[24:21] that's somebody that don't
[24:23] I'm not going to say it yeah I am he's
[24:25] not late for the first quarter
[24:28] right and besides this giving all
[24:30] diligence add to your faith virtually
[24:32] virtual knowledge and all its Temperance
[24:33] Temperance patience and the patience
[24:36] godliness and we'll get to that in just
[24:37] a little bit because
[24:39] be patient with me
[24:40] and your patience possess ye your souls
[24:44] in patience
[24:46] possess you your soul all right let's
[24:48] look at the chart just for a second now
[24:50] this chart is a chart that that the
[24:54] prophet of God told us that this is how
[24:56] the human being now there is no way that
[24:58] we could take brother Michael today and
[25:00] sew him in half it would be ugly and
[25:03] messy and but we could turn him out like
[25:06] that and let you look and they would be
[25:07] Rings like a like a tree there's not
[25:09] that way
[25:10] but but the only way we can show it that
[25:13] we can understand it as a as a whole is
[25:16] to understand it is that that's the way
[25:18] we look it's all it's also intertwined
[25:21] that you can't that you don't have the
[25:23] round circles inside your body like I
[25:24] said before you can't you can't
[25:26] yourself open and see a body no you see
[25:29] the body all right the spirit is talking
[25:31] to you today but the soul down on the
[25:33] inside that's the real you that's the
[25:34] one that's going to do the listening and
[25:37] I hope do the preaching of the word of
[25:38] God today all right and there's only two
[25:41] there's only Faith or doubt there's not
[25:43] the devil and God inside your soul
[25:44] fighting it out back and forth no one
[25:47] has one one has one over the other
[25:50] all right one has w-o-n over the other
[25:53] because you yield to which one you
[25:55] either yield to doubt the reason you
[25:57] yield to doubt is because you don't
[25:58] believe
[25:59] that's really simple
[26:01] but there's either Faith or doubt and
[26:03] that's the holy of holies that's where
[26:04] either God resides or the devil resides
[26:06] and if you're born of natural lendings
[26:09] like brother Bob was talking about
[26:11] natural land that's why I said serpent
[26:13] seed in the garden my Heavens that tells
[26:15] you right now that you're born and sin
[26:17] Bible said born in sin Shepherd iniquity
[26:19] spousal members mother's womb kids are
[26:22] liars
[26:27] sorry kids they all go frowning when you
[26:29] say that
[26:31] you're denying it now
[26:33] we all listen
[26:36] how many times how many times your kids
[26:38] lied to you
[26:40] yeah oh don't even talk about it so
[26:43] anyway so did that come from God does
[26:45] lying come from God
[26:47] no lying comes from the Devil
[26:50] and then all them other things do too
[26:53] but if you get born again in your soul
[26:55] that's the faith of God has come into
[26:58] you give you a birth not a birth like
[27:02] brother the Bible's talking about that's
[27:03] why that birth is our problem
[27:07] Jesus looked at Nicodemus and said you
[27:09] must be born again
[27:12] and Nicodemus goes to the Natural he
[27:14] said do I need to go get back in my
[27:16] mother's womb and be reborn and Jesus
[27:19] said no you got to be born from what
[27:21] above the womb of your mind is now what
[27:23] God's working with
[27:25] everybody with me
[27:27] then the spirit Realm
[27:29] is Imagination conscious memory reason
[27:32] and or reasoning and affection because
[27:35] remember that's what you've got to
[27:38] contact the spirit realm of you today
[27:41] you are listening today you are
[27:44] listening you are conscious that you're
[27:47] sitting in church most of you until a
[27:49] few minutes from now and then your
[27:51] memory you're thinking well that's what
[27:52] brother Brown said that's not what he
[27:54] said that by the Bible said this your
[27:56] your memory is going one way or the
[27:58] other are either remembering that you
[28:00] left your dinner at home and you're
[28:01] gonna have to go back and get it
[28:03] your reasoning your reasoning to the
[28:05] word of God today your reasoning whether
[28:07] I'm telling you the truth or not
[28:09] and then your affection is filial love
[28:12] not agape love
[28:13] because filial love is conditional
[28:16] sorry it is agape love is
[28:19] non-conditional God loved us and he knew
[28:23] what we were going to do and he still
[28:24] loved us and I'll tell you one more
[28:26] thing remember I said before if God ever
[28:27] loved you one time he can't unlove you
[28:30] that ought to make you happy that ought
[28:33] to make you know that you're sealed in
[28:35] if he loved you and he saw that you'd
[28:37] love him back he never unloved you
[28:39] that's right
[28:40] the problem is is we have filial love
[28:43] that looks back and says oh I did this
[28:45] or God must not love me you can't ever
[28:47] say God must not love me
[28:51] you're lying see there you are
[28:54] you never can say God must not love me
[28:57] anymore he can't change his mind
[29:00] you change your mind
[29:05] but those five
[29:06] senses
[29:08] are the spirit realm but they have to be
[29:10] manifested by what this guy the seeing
[29:13] the smelling the hearing the tasting and
[29:16] the feeling and all those see tastes
[29:19] feel smell in here there to contact the
[29:20] world but you can be deceived by all
[29:22] that
[29:24] right you can be deceived by all that
[29:27] um
[29:28] I tell you before you know you June
[29:30] makes a scented soap
[29:33] and you know you can close your oh eyes
[29:37] and smell this bar of soap and you you
[29:40] would you would your senses is telling
[29:42] you that you're smelling a clot of dirt
[29:45] because I'm a deer hunter so she buys
[29:47] this little bottle of stuff it's not
[29:48] much more bigger than that and it says
[29:50] dirt
[29:52] it's liquid
[29:54] but it smells like dirt
[29:56] you close your eyes and smell of it
[29:58] you'd swear somebody had a clot of dirt
[30:00] in their hand but you open your eyes and
[30:01] there's a bar of soap so you can be you
[30:04] in your seat taste still smelling here
[30:06] you can be deceived
[30:08] all right they're by with me in your
[30:11] memory reasons the conscious facts
[30:12] imagination you can be deceived
[30:15] but I promise you one thing if you've
[30:17] got faith inside your soul that part of
[30:20] you cannot be deceived that part of you
[30:22] will tell you I'll crawl to church that
[30:24] part will tell you I'll get here and
[30:26] I'll pray and I'll I'll do the things
[30:28] I'm supposed to do willingly not because
[30:31] I have to
[30:33] I don't I have never since I got born
[30:35] again come to church because I have to
[30:37] and I've been saved now 20 something
[30:39] years never have I done that I gotta go
[30:42] no I gotta go
[30:45] ah gotta go hey man the Deep draws me to
[30:49] that right
[30:51] right my deed didn't draw me to that
[30:53] before he drew me away
[30:56] because there is a deep down inside of
[30:58] you before you get born again
[31:00] and it's that doubt
[31:03] well that's no religion thing I don't
[31:05] know about that well your doubter you're
[31:07] not a Believer you become an unbeliever
[31:09] so let's quit for being unbelievers but
[31:12] now remember
[31:15] excuse me the way we see it the way the
[31:18] Bible teaches us that the soul that
[31:21] sinneth it shall die
[31:23] the soul
[31:25] right the soul the real you that inner
[31:28] person if it sins it dies if it accepts
[31:32] God and God puts itself in there burns
[31:35] the whole part of you out seals you in
[31:37] by the Holy Ghost it cannot fail it
[31:41] cannot get lost it cannot get unloved
[31:44] because it is love
[31:47] everybody with me
[31:49] so there's what we're looking at now
[31:51] when we come to the stature of a perfect
[31:53] man though
[31:55] this guy right here if he's born again
[31:58] he has that is the very soul of God
[32:02] that's the Genesis 1 26 man that God is
[32:05] imparted and he's the only one who can
[32:06] do it
[32:07] he has took a piece of that eternal life
[32:09] and put it in you his brother around
[32:11] said we read the quote not too long ago
[32:13] a little button a little white button
[32:15] God puts a little thing inside of you
[32:17] then what does it do it has to grow amen
[32:20] and we'll talk about in just a minute
[32:21] because remember justification
[32:24] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[32:27] Ghost and then there's one more part
[32:29] there's a living part there's a word
[32:31] that God has to put inside of you and if
[32:34] it's the word of God it's a Living Word
[32:36] of God I wish somebody get happy my
[32:39] goodness y'all sit there look like this
[32:40] right here all you want to but I'm
[32:42] telling you they something but you know
[32:43] why it's something down inside of you
[32:45] that ain't got nothing
[32:48] and that's Southern language but I don't
[32:49] care
[32:51] cause I promise you you will have a
[32:54] desire for something
[32:56] you'll desire something I don't care
[32:58] what it is you're going to desire
[33:00] something inside your heart because you
[33:02] are a human being and you're built that
[33:04] way
[33:06] man you're three more agencies gonna put
[33:08] you in hell or put you in heaven one of
[33:10] the two
[33:12] absolutely if you go to hell you gotta
[33:13] walk over me you got to walk over the
[33:15] Bible you got to walk over Jesus Christ
[33:18] because he's standing to do one thing
[33:20] for you and I saved your soul
[33:24] not just clean you up and make me a good
[33:26] person and and no
[33:29] no he puts a new person inside there
[33:32] if he puts a new person inside there
[33:35] that desire has got to be
[33:38] of God it can't be of the world anymore
[33:40] now the spirit realm there's our issue
[33:43] it can still be of the world
[33:49] ly influences are they're bombarding us
[33:52] as we speak
[33:57] because those those inlets
[34:00] are not covered
[34:02] but bye
[34:05] Peter telling us how to get them covered
[34:09] by not just the new birth but add to
[34:11] your new birth that's what II Peter's
[34:13] telling us back to your new birth what
[34:15] get that Spirit realm to do what to
[34:18] yield to that one's inside of you
[34:20] because like I said before
[34:23] what I tell you it's First of the Year
[34:24] let it out you're going to one way or
[34:27] the other you're going to prove who you
[34:29] are and the further we get or the closer
[34:31] we get to God you're going to prove who
[34:33] you are you can't help it
[34:37] the Bible tells us that even brother
[34:39] Brown says
[34:41] the Bible tells us that a sinner can't
[34:43] set in the congregation of the righteous
[34:44] there's going to come to time folks
[34:50] when it's death to walk through them
[34:51] doors right there
[34:53] and a nice sense of fire ananias walked
[34:55] in he said I'll give everything
[34:57] Peter said you lied
[34:59] see you didn't lie to me you lied to the
[35:00] Holy Ghost
[35:02] and his wife comes in because she's a
[35:03] co-conspirator she knew what was going
[35:05] on too and God didn't spare her just
[35:07] because she's a woman either
[35:09] they took them both out
[35:14] everybody with me
[35:15] I don't know where that came from but I
[35:17] ain't charging you for that either
[35:19] so let's look here
[35:21] pull it back up everybody understand
[35:23] like I said you can't catch that up
[35:25] you're a unit if you pull the soul out
[35:27] you're dead if you just pull up if you
[35:28] pull the spirit out you're not a human
[35:30] being if you take the flesh off you
[35:32] definitely are in a mess
[35:34] okay because this is what's holding
[35:35] everything together
[35:36] all right so that's what we're looking
[35:38] at today we're working on that Spirit
[35:39] realm can't do anything about your body
[35:42] listen we can paint it prep it
[35:44] take the wrinkles out
[35:47] watch out you don't have any well
[35:50] darling you ain't got a wrinkle nowhere
[35:52] goodness gracious Godly jealousy my
[35:55] brother Godly jealous
[35:56] but you
[36:01] but you I don't care you're still dying
[36:04] we're all dying I remember brother
[36:05] calling he's walking we used to go down
[36:07] General Motors and they had like open
[36:09] house and we go walk brother colleague
[36:11] remember when you know the wheel you did
[36:12] the the tire
[36:14] yeah he'd take a tire you know how much
[36:17] a tire weighs
[36:19] he basically stick his fingers in the in
[36:21] the hole of the tire and take two of
[36:23] them and slap them try it today
[36:27] I'll pay somebody else to do it
[36:30] but that's what
[36:37] that's what when I
[36:38] that we have to be sick
[36:42] nesses of the devil
[36:44] not of God
[36:46] everybody with me so now look we're
[36:48] going to add to your new birth or add to
[36:50] what we're looking here we're adding to
[36:53] that soul of God you're adding not him
[36:55] he is already he's complete
[36:58] but we're human we were born under that
[37:00] as Bob was talking about we're born
[37:02] under the under the uh uh let me just
[37:05] say under the sex Covenant where we
[37:07] should have been born under the
[37:08] spiritual spiritual multiplication over
[37:11] here where it says Genesis 1 says let us
[37:13] make man in our own image and after our
[37:15] likeness and let them have dominion over
[37:16] the fish of the sea and foul the air and
[37:18] let them multiply and replenish the
[37:20] Earth they weren't even they weren't
[37:21] human bodies
[37:23] so now though God has took this that
[37:25] Satan did and that Eve did and she fell
[37:28] by that and the whole human race went
[37:30] downhill Adam was the one that sold us
[37:32] out folks not Eve Adam's the one that
[37:34] said I'll accept what she done
[37:36] but you know what Christ stood one day I
[37:38] said I'll accept what they did amen
[37:41] Adam you can't do anything about it but
[37:45] I can because I'm God and I'm going to
[37:48] stand in the gap for him and that Eve's
[37:50] not going to fall like that Eve did oh
[37:53] praise the Lord we're going to get into
[37:54] that in just a minute let's go to the
[37:56] look over here so add to your new birth
[37:59] so now I'm born again boy I just you
[38:01] know um
[38:04] you take somebody you know and you you
[38:06] have a child and
[38:08] and sister Pam I tell the people
[38:10] babies they're beautiful they they come
[38:13] to the Earth you know they
[38:15] but now I'm gonna take that baby and I'm
[38:17] gonna go put it in that office shut the
[38:19] door three months later I'm gonna come
[38:20] back and he'll be ah
[38:23] it'll be dead
[38:25] why because you didn't feed it you
[38:27] didn't nourish it God wants children
[38:28] that he can feed he don't mind feeding
[38:31] you but he don't want you to keep
[38:34] drinking milk all the time he wants you
[38:36] to eat meat every once in a while
[38:38] eat some vegetables every once while
[38:40] then what's gonna happen I remember when
[38:42] Michael first started they started
[38:43] coming to church here he was well
[38:46] you could about get him right here
[38:48] I can't get one part of his arm right
[38:50] here now
[38:52] he's six what three
[38:54] close to four
[38:56] what happened his mama fed him well
[38:59] guess what I want my daddy to feed me
[39:02] I want my heavenly father to feed me I
[39:04] haven't walked this 22 years and just
[39:06] still be a baby
[39:08] you shouldn't either if you still have
[39:11] to be told to do stuff you're a baby
[39:13] [Music]
[39:14] ain't that what a kid is
[39:16] a kid has to be told
[39:19] what to do
[39:21] I believe it will brother Louise
[39:25] I'm talking about but now remember
[39:27] everything's all
[39:29] well this message that we're living is
[39:31] is beautiful right but remember we still
[39:34] according to the prophet we got out of
[39:37] Step
[39:39] remember he had a vision he had the
[39:41] church come up first or the Bride come
[39:43] up first she was in preview and now
[39:45] she's listen she's she's safe away in
[39:47] another dimension all right uh we don't
[39:50] believe it's there in heaven you know
[39:52] it's just old Mama wives tale that says
[39:54] I'm you know I'm going to walk streets
[39:55] to go with Jesus no not yet
[39:58] because John saw the city coming down in
[40:00] Revelations 22. it's not over there yet
[40:02] in another dimension because remember
[40:03] where's it coming it's coming here
[40:09] but we know that by what there's a
[40:11] message of the hour that God sent us a
[40:13] prophet and that Prophet cleared the way
[40:15] for us to not understand the prophet
[40:17] more
[40:18] to understand Jesus Christ more to
[40:21] understand this Bible better than
[40:23] anywhere
[40:24] I was thinking in there just before I
[40:26] came out I said man what Bob spoke on
[40:29] today that 30 minutes
[40:33] 90 of the people no 99 of the people in
[40:37] this world do not believe that
[40:43] well that makes Bob wrong then he just
[40:44] he just he's just wronged by the
[40:46] majority no
[40:48] God's one right
[40:50] he made the world he's going to destroy
[40:52] it and he's still going to be one yes so
[40:54] I you know what I put my I put mine on
[40:56] him I'll put my uh all my all my uh
[40:59] whatever it is everything I want to talk
[41:01] about and see is what he's told us in
[41:03] the Bible but I want to see it in
[41:05] Clarity I don't want to see it foggy I
[41:07] don't want to see it where I gotta well
[41:09] how did that happen well I know how that
[41:11] happened
[41:15] so you see how privileged people we are
[41:17] to have Revelation and we'll get to that
[41:18] in just a second
[41:20] we might not get to the to the virtue
[41:22] but we got to cover some things right
[41:23] here but she'll get out of
[41:31] stuff I said another there was a
[41:32] matriarch and the
[41:34] um or a patriarch in the community died
[41:37] and then we had a matriarch a couple
[41:38] days ago she passed away she taught me
[41:40] in Sunday School in the Baptist Church
[41:41] and she was just a as far as a nominal
[41:43] Christians Fannie was wonderful 94 years
[41:46] old Lord let her live a good long life
[41:49] but she passed away and
[41:51] I was sitting there talking to uh one of
[41:54] the
[41:55] I don't know if
[41:56] anyone
[41:57] Baptist or not but
[41:59] it's okay
[42:02] I asked I asked Ray I said
[42:05] y'all Baptist and
[42:07] you got methodists why don't you go to
[42:09] Methodist Church
[42:10] because remember I asked that young boy
[42:12] that several years ago
[42:14] uh Chris Porter I said
[42:17] he said well we don't believe what they
[42:18] believe
[42:19] oh okay so you don't go to the Methodist
[42:22] Church you're Baptist so you go you
[42:23] don't go to Massachusetts because you
[42:24] don't believe what they said actually
[42:25] you're gonna go Catholic
[42:27] no I ain't going to Catholic Church
[42:28] that's the that's you know that's
[42:29] Marco base
[42:33] and so how we all get into heaven
[42:37] they're gonna be like a street down this
[42:38] way for the Pentecostals and a street
[42:41] down there is for the Methodist come on
[42:43] somebody
[42:44] Street down here for the Baptist and the
[42:46] street of course if you're a Baptist
[42:47] your Street's wider
[42:51] and then one for the message no
[42:54] that city is Four Square
[42:56] that City listen I see he's got a wall
[42:59] around it to do what keep the people out
[43:06] why you got walls in your house keep
[43:08] people from seeing what's going on
[43:12] but in that City we're gonna have
[43:13] transparent walk transparent walk
[43:15] because we're not gonna have anything
[43:16] that we need to keep Secret
[43:18] but God still did build a wall
[43:23] what does the wall do it separates
[43:25] amen
[43:27] you all know we all need to be there
[43:30] we all gonna be one there I promise you
[43:33] you don't have no Baptist badge or
[43:35] Pentecostal badge you won't even have a
[43:37] message badge I'll just be happy to get
[43:39] there it doesn't matter what kind of bag
[43:41] y'all wear amen foreign
[43:44] but we're getting out of we were getting
[43:46] out of Step according to this dream and
[43:48] this vision
[43:50] brother Brown saw the bride and then he
[43:52] saw the church in other words that was
[43:54] that was messed up in all these
[43:55] doctrines of water baptism and different
[43:58] things and and trinitarian doctrines
[44:00] that there's no such thing in the Bible
[44:01] and then you got these other things
[44:03] water baptism named father son Holy
[44:05] Ghost you that's exactly what Jesus said
[44:07] but that ain't what he said
[44:09] hey man
[44:10] he said name he didn't say names he said
[44:13] name father's not her name Sons not her
[44:15] name Holy Ghost is not a name right
[44:17] so what is the name the Lord Jesus
[44:19] Christ according to what Peter said if
[44:21] not Peter and Jesus was was one of them
[44:23] was wrong and that you need to carry one
[44:25] of them out of the Bible because they're
[44:27] both in there all right
[44:29] so we come through all that that's why
[44:31] God had to send us a prophet what bring
[44:32] us the entire word of God he took the
[44:35] Loose Ends and put them back together
[44:36] where it happened in a man in the
[44:38] nominational world in in Rome and in all
[44:40] these other places then he sent a
[44:43] Lutheran to Wesley we'll read in just a
[44:44] second but he said the bride comes back
[44:46] because she's Alpha and Omega God the
[44:49] great sculptor listen it's all God if it
[44:52] was up to man we'd just be totally we'd
[44:54] be pitiful
[44:56] but God's got his hand on this thing he
[44:59] knows what he's doing he knows what
[45:01] you'll do with it that's why he give it
[45:03] to you
[45:06] listen he's not going to give you the
[45:08] Holy Ghost to lose you
[45:11] that's right remember he's not a loser
[45:14] Satan's a loser
[45:16] right I hope well he did hear it he's
[45:18] sitting here right now already so
[45:20] but it's a masterpiece God's Building
[45:22] and he's got a plan and a purpose as we
[45:25] said before last Wednesday night
[45:27] a plan is a method of achieving an end
[45:30] so he is going to have a plan to achieve
[45:33] an end
[45:34] a detailed formulation of a program of
[45:38] action you see it right here this is the
[45:40] plan of God
[45:42] this is the will of God this is the only
[45:44] way God will work
[45:46] is by the Bible
[45:49] verse 1100
[45:52] sermons to make it clear what God was
[45:55] telling us because
[45:56] why did Jesus Jesus stand up and tell
[45:58] him who the story was tell them what
[45:59] this was the Bible said he spoke
[46:01] everything in Parables well I died
[46:04] when Moses was writing the Hey listen
[46:06] Moses wrote what happened in the garden
[46:07] right
[46:09] Moses wrote the first five books of the
[46:11] Bible Moses was old but he wasn't that
[46:14] old
[46:15] but he was sitting there writing and he
[46:17] saw what went on God said hey hide that
[46:21] right hide that from the wise
[46:22] Improvement and we're going to reveal it
[46:23] to babes such as we'll listen and learn
[46:26] what's going on thank God
[46:29] he speaks to us in a mystery
[46:31] that it has to be a revelation
[46:33] for us to see what's going on
[46:35] then as we were talking about this the
[46:38] first church was the first church had
[46:40] these virtues working the middle
[46:41] churches did not even with uh Luther and
[46:45] Wesley they were still caught up in
[46:47] denominationalism but four death
[46:49] Messengers eat it which you're talking
[46:51] about there in the restoration of the
[46:52] bright tree and we see that that
[46:54] happened in Joel Joel promised he said I
[46:57] will restore what these four bugs eat
[47:00] down the caterpillar Palmer worm canker
[47:02] worm and all those different bugs they
[47:04] eat it there what they eat the word down
[47:05] they didn't eat the word they eat the
[47:07] effects of the word down God can't
[47:09] listen God has
[47:12] what a gracious God he does work
[47:15] if you got a little bit of false
[47:17] Doctrine
[47:19] because that's Grace
[47:21] but there's come a time when he said
[47:23] this is it
[47:24] I'm going to send you a prophet in the
[47:26] end time according to Malachi 4. he's
[47:28] going to turn our heart yes Saul back to
[47:33] those Pentecostal fathers and then what
[47:35] are we going to do we're going to take
[47:36] it on to the rapture
[47:39] man if you don't believe this is the end
[47:41] time you're in bad shape you've been
[47:42] deceived
[47:45] never seen such a Sodom commit condition
[47:47] my heavens
[47:49] good Lord we got people running the
[47:51] country telling us what our health is is
[47:53] a transvestite
[47:57] that current administration's filth
[48:01] every one of them's filth
[48:04] but for you to purposely put somebody in
[48:06] there to Health and Human Services and
[48:08] he was a she and she was a he
[48:11] that's what's making our policies now
[48:13] folks
[48:15] listen
[48:17] she was an ugly man she's a real ugly
[48:19] woman now
[48:21] I'm just going to make black black white
[48:23] white I'm telling you but that's who got
[48:25] put into position to tell you what to do
[48:29] with your children and your eats and
[48:32] you're this and that
[48:33] you'd be a Democrat all you want to I
[48:35] don't care but if you can if you can
[48:37] deal with abortion then
[48:39] God forgive you
[48:42] I don't want I'm not I'm not doing no
[48:44] I'm gone I'm done from that
[48:47] what was the third was Pentecost the
[48:49] restoration of the gifts the Holy Ghost
[48:51] the Holy Ghost came in 1906 but still
[48:53] they were trinitarians still they had
[48:56] ideas that was contrary to God but God
[48:59] brought back number four which is the
[49:02] word of God and what has life the word
[49:05] of God has life
[49:06] for messengers of righteousness are
[49:09] going to restore listen we are the
[49:11] recipients of that
[49:13] Pentecost is not to recipient of that
[49:16] shock
[49:18] God enjoyed it when he had it but he
[49:20] moved on
[49:22] he moved
[49:31] don't say get back in line I'm telling
[49:33] you today we got to get back in line
[49:35] before we get out of here
[49:38] prophesy son of man that's exactly what
[49:40] happened you heard the son of man
[49:42] Ministry when Bob stood right here and
[49:44] said good morning people
[49:47] you heard the ministry of the son of man
[49:51] praise the Lord
[49:56] valley of dry bones everything got
[49:58] together but one thing happened
[50:00] there was no breath
[50:01] there was no life
[50:05] breathe whole Breath of God breathe what
[50:09] the Breath of God is life
[50:12] what the fourth was the word itself I
[50:15] just read you in the beginning was the
[50:16] what word the word was with God and the
[50:19] Word was God and that word was made
[50:22] flesh
[50:24] so the fourth was the word Jesus Christ
[50:26] was the Living Word standing in two feet
[50:29] in a human body that gave his life for
[50:32] me and you so that he could walk into
[50:34] feet in a human body in a bride
[50:39] but he took the word coming back in
[50:41] power
[50:42] the word itself is here today
[50:45] not just an idea
[50:48] what my priest today is not an idea
[50:50] it's the whole Bible
[50:53] come on
[50:57] the word made flesh
[51:00] fruits of the proof of the Resurrection
[51:01] sign that Christ has finally looked
[51:03] Christ has finally in other words he's
[51:06] finally got somebody he could work
[51:08] through 100 percent work through
[51:12] sanctification
[51:13] been planted baptism of the Holy Ghost
[51:16] organizations died out and Christ has
[51:18] again centered himself like that cap of
[51:21] the pyramid first line justification
[51:23] sanctification baptism the Holocaust
[51:24] then the coming of the cap
[51:27] who was he he was the Chief Cornerstone
[51:30] but he was the headstone
[51:32] they couldn't take him as The Headstone
[51:34] so they killed him
[51:37] but he said I'm coming back as the Chief
[51:39] Cornerstone I'm going to start this
[51:41] thing with a bride and a foundation on
[51:44] the day of Pentecost 2000 years ago and
[51:47] I'm going to build my church the way I
[51:49] want it built
[51:51] he couldn't build his church in the Old
[51:53] Testament he couldn't build his church
[51:54] in Bob Garden of Eden
[51:57] he got cut off yeah
[51:59] and in the Old Testament the blood of
[52:01] bulls and ghosts could only cover amen
[52:04] remember what I said to you the other
[52:06] day
[52:07] think about it
[52:09] he's a high priest of what he didn't say
[52:11] he's a high priest of your faith
[52:15] y'all I gotta have faith
[52:17] he's the high priest of your confession
[52:21] if you confess negative he has to stand
[52:24] before the father and do this
[52:29] think about that he can only take a
[52:32] positive confession to God
[52:36] so who stopped us
[52:39] take your finger don't point it at me
[52:41] take your finger and go
[52:43] Sarah don't point at your mama
[52:51] we're our biggest enemy we know that you
[52:53] know somebody don't have to tell you
[52:54] that we're our worst enemy but if we
[52:56] will what yield ourselves to God do the
[52:58] vice versa brother Brian said boy that's
[53:00] a complete revelation
[53:03] if you stand you give money away
[53:10] what is it
[53:11] that Holy Ghost bunch
[53:16] that Holy Ghost Bunch y'all y'all are
[53:18] now a bunch
[53:20] that Holy Ghost Bunch being honed out so
[53:23] that it can fit with the same kind of
[53:25] ministry he had oh we gave priests like
[53:28] Jesus we are preaching like Jesus
[53:33] Ministry that's what he said he said and
[53:36] Ephesians he sent Apostles prophets past
[53:40] what to teach what Jesus said
[53:44] be happy
[53:46] it's to us
[53:49] sorry about getting excited but I just
[53:51] something stirring
[53:53] look because
[53:56] the hunter what the chairs
[53:59] your car
[54:01] the airplane
[54:02] the drums yeah
[54:06] they'll catch you the whole thing in the
[54:08] Rapture where the Justified Sanctified
[54:10] baptism the whole ghost that pyramid
[54:12] will stand again I declare to you today
[54:14] he's standing here today
[54:17] oh I believe that bro
[54:20] I believe that
[54:23] the house of God will live again it's
[54:24] going to live in a group of people I
[54:26] promise you that the tree of life is
[54:28] growing again
[54:29] we're at this Wednesday night I want to
[54:31] read it one more time Ezekiel 47 3 if
[54:33] you'll pay attention you can take that
[54:34] off if you want to
[54:36] um
[54:38] when a man
[54:39] that had the line in his hand went forth
[54:41] Eastward
[54:43] he measured a thousand cubits
[54:46] and this is Ezekiel and there's a man
[54:48] helping him in this Vision everybody
[54:51] with me on this all right so he brought
[54:53] him up to the waters now he didn't just
[54:55] say now don't step in there he took him
[54:58] to the ankles
[55:01] that's not so bad you can kick water
[55:03] around we ankles all you want to
[55:05] you stay out of church all you want to
[55:07] wouldn't get around the ankles
[55:09] again he measured and brought me through
[55:11] the water what he brought through what
[55:13] up to the knees in other words he's
[55:14] stepping out further yes
[55:16] he's stepping out further
[55:19] God's leading him
[55:22] up to the knees or a little harder to
[55:24] walk that way
[55:26] but all my luck
[55:27] he kept going another thousand
[55:30] and got to the loins where is the loins
[55:33] Bob was talking about today life
[55:37] that's where life comes from
[55:39] what
[55:39] justification ankles
[55:42] sanctification knees harder to walk yeah
[55:46] by the Holy Ghost life in the loins but
[55:49] that's not all
[55:51] he didn't turn him around then to send
[55:53] him back
[55:54] Ezekiel says look in this Vision he says
[55:57] afterwards he measured another thousand
[55:59] and it was a river that I couldn't pass
[56:02] over but the waters was just swimming
[56:06] today we're swimming in the Holy Ghost
[56:08] we're swimming in the word of God
[56:11] you can be dead if you want to
[56:14] God's moving on folks I'm telling you
[56:18] we took a whole year
[56:21] was going through all this we've been
[56:23] going through a lot of things all those
[56:24] have been sitting different ones but I'm
[56:26] telling you folks every year that gets
[56:28] closer to the coming of the lord we
[56:30] should want more
[56:32] not less
[56:36] that's right
[56:37] a water that could not be passed over a
[56:39] water listen you can't swim and I ain't
[56:41] gonna need water
[56:44] try it
[56:46] remember brother Brown he's showing his
[56:47] daddy how he could in that he's showing
[56:50] his daddy how he could swim and he
[56:51] jumped in a mud hole
[56:53] yeah his daddy's laughing names and he
[56:55] ain't swimming son
[56:58] but we're in water now
[57:00] that we can swim in
[57:02] but now watch what happened God didn't
[57:05] stop right there
[57:08] son of man
[57:10] hast thou seen this
[57:12] then he brought me and caused me to
[57:14] return to the brink of the river
[57:20] justification sanctification baptism the
[57:22] Holy Ghost the word of God
[57:23] and then you come right back again and
[57:25] you take a higher form of justification
[57:27] higher form of sanctification higher
[57:30] form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[57:31] higher form of the word of God listen
[57:34] God I this is his plan I'm just telling
[57:37] you what his plan is today all right if
[57:38] you have a problem with his plan go talk
[57:40] to him but I'll tell you if you hear
[57:43] somebody say well I don't know why God
[57:44] wrote it that way I do because it's the
[57:47] only way he saw
[57:48] he can't change his mind we're looking
[57:51] at we change our mind so I don't think
[57:52] I'll write it that way but God's not
[57:53] that
[57:55] he wrote it the way he wanted he wanted
[57:56] it
[57:57] we're supposed to live it the way he
[57:59] wrote it
[58:04] then he brought me and caused me to
[58:05] return back to the Brinks of the river
[58:06] now when I returned behold the bank of
[58:09] the river there's very many trees wash
[58:10] trees life
[58:13] on one side and the other and he said
[58:14] unto me these Waters issue out toward
[58:17] the East Country go down into the desert
[58:19] go down to the sea in other words you're
[58:20] gonna have good days and bad days you're
[58:22] gonna have a lot of water one day you
[58:24] can have a lot of desert one day
[58:26] which being brought forth into the sea
[58:29] the waters shall be healed
[58:32] and it shall come to pass that
[58:34] everything that liveth which moveth
[58:38] some of y'all ought to try them
[58:43] moveth
[58:45] whether so ever the river shall come
[58:47] shall what live
[58:50] it's life listen you think oh my life is
[58:54] so good
[58:55] in one
[58:57] one act could change
[58:59] what is
[59:05] it I know Sister Ruth being a nurse and
[59:08] Sister Sarah
[59:09] they've seen life-changing things happen
[59:10] just like that
[59:13] you have an issue and something going on
[59:15] or you'd be working outside and run a
[59:18] saw across all your fingers and cut
[59:19] every one of them off
[59:21] that's a life-changing experience just
[59:22] in a Split Second
[59:25] today
[59:27] you're in a life-changing experience
[59:29] whether you like it or not
[59:32] you're either going to leave here worse
[59:34] are you going to leave here better
[59:35] that's what the prophet said see we we
[59:37] really we hone in just like we we like
[59:39] to we like our pet quotes that brother
[59:41] Dale said because you know what it
[59:42] matches what we want
[59:48] but you got to take all of it
[59:50] we got our little quotes that brother
[59:52] Brown said we got a little quotes that
[59:53] this one said but can we take all of it
[59:57] because the Bible tells us
[1:00:00] we're going to have good days and bad
[1:00:01] days
[1:00:02] the prophet of God said we're gonna have
[1:00:03] good days
[1:00:04] you know why because he had them
[1:00:07] oh he was a prophet he lived yeah he
[1:00:10] lived just like me and you right
[1:00:12] he just lived a little closer to God
[1:00:15] but folks let me tell you something as I
[1:00:17] said Wednesday night
[1:00:19] the sin that we're dealing with the
[1:00:21] heartaches we're dealing with the trials
[1:00:23] we're dealing with the sickness we're
[1:00:25] dealing with all sin has an expiration
[1:00:28] date praise God
[1:00:31] man that ought to make you shout it has
[1:00:35] [Applause]
[1:00:38] this worldly knowledge this Cosmos all
[1:00:41] this stuff that we're putting all our
[1:00:43] faith in oh come on people good grief
[1:00:46] you better put your faith in the word of
[1:00:48] God that you'll be able to stand one day
[1:00:51] and say God I need for my family to eat
[1:00:54] God I need gas in my tank God I need my
[1:00:58] children saved
[1:01:03] The Living Word comes into us and it
[1:01:06] does the same effect on Earth what tells
[1:01:09] us the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:01:11] they call Jesus belzebub
[1:01:13] they called him a devil he was God
[1:01:17] and it wasn't the world
[1:01:19] it was a religious people they called
[1:01:22] him a devil
[1:01:25] Living Word comes into us and it does
[1:01:27] the same effect on us see same because
[1:01:29] it's the same word it's the same thing
[1:01:31] among us he he's bringing Among Us
[1:01:35] and that's the way and sometimes those
[1:01:37] who are not in that bracket speak with
[1:01:39] tongues and another one interprets what
[1:01:40] is it the word made flesh again among us
[1:01:44] let's continue on just for a minute
[1:01:47] Prophet God said we're made partakers of
[1:01:49] his Holiness we Holiness we In His Image
[1:01:52] we are living images
[1:01:54] of a living God
[1:01:58] I got one amen out of this whole
[1:02:00] building
[1:02:06] people that are alive usually speak
[1:02:09] if you did you don't
[1:02:11] we're living images of a living God dead
[1:02:14] to self raised with him
[1:02:18] listen I'm going to say this well I get
[1:02:20] in trouble I don't care I am really if
[1:02:22] I'm if I understand in this Pulpit you
[1:02:25] can't tell me what to say
[1:02:27] either God tells me or I'm in my own
[1:02:29] self and God's going to correct me all
[1:02:31] right nobody else will that's wrong
[1:02:35] but I'm telling you something if we
[1:02:37] don't get off of our can and start
[1:02:40] living this word of God and I mean start
[1:02:43] worshiping I mean start reading have to
[1:02:46] lift it get away from the world get away
[1:02:48] there
[1:02:50] is building
[1:02:52] there's enough knowledge in the word of
[1:02:54] God in this building to make the Rapture
[1:02:57] take place
[1:02:58] but what are we doing about it
[1:03:02] amen
[1:03:09] more is given
[1:03:12] more is required
[1:03:16] we've had the word of God preached for
[1:03:18] 50 years here we have never had to
[1:03:20] correct error in this church
[1:03:22] coming from Brother Dale never
[1:03:27] right
[1:03:28] if he had something he corrected himself
[1:03:31] but we had a prophetic gift we still do
[1:03:34] you can listen
[1:03:37] but what have we done with it
[1:03:40] can't get to church can't get Church on
[1:03:41] time can't live the word of God can't
[1:03:43] read her Bible can't do this can't do
[1:03:45] that I can't do this I can't do that I
[1:03:47] can't do this I can't do that where we
[1:03:48] come from
[1:03:49] we're still babies
[1:03:51] brother Dale preached us meet
[1:03:54] for years
[1:03:56] and we're still going
[1:04:00] I'm talking about me and everybody
[1:04:03] there's enough word in here for us to
[1:04:05] have power against the devil power
[1:04:07] against sickness power against all kinds
[1:04:11] of principalities and powers and now
[1:04:13] what we're fighting we're not fighting
[1:04:15] individual people
[1:04:17] we were talking about something the
[1:04:18] other day you know the people that come
[1:04:19] and go look at brother George they don't
[1:04:21] care he's on the front row praise God
[1:04:25] he was gone
[1:04:26] disappeared
[1:04:29] God's still working
[1:04:32] God's still working and he told me the
[1:04:35] other day just several a couple weeks
[1:04:37] ago he stepped out and he said I think I
[1:04:39] kind of know what's going on now
[1:04:41] so here he is in church
[1:04:43] serving God
[1:04:45] some of the other ones have drifted out
[1:04:46] we're praying for him to come back in
[1:04:48] but now some of y'all are sitting here
[1:04:50] and you're drifting out you ain't coming
[1:04:51] back
[1:04:53] this is not for everybody folks but you
[1:04:55] know what
[1:04:57] until I draw my last breath
[1:04:59] I won't believe you are
[1:05:03] brother Dale never discluded one person
[1:05:06] he preaching his pulpit and he's like
[1:05:08] brother Branham he you never knew who he
[1:05:10] liked and who well that was the devil is
[1:05:12] who he don't like okay we understood
[1:05:14] that he didn't like the devil hey man I
[1:05:16] don't like him there
[1:05:18] I don't want him to be my best friend
[1:05:22] I'll get to something in just a second
[1:05:24] if you'll bear with me
[1:05:27] the word in you making itself real real
[1:05:31] glory to God I know you think I'm a Holy
[1:05:33] Roller
[1:05:35] I don't care
[1:05:37] triumph over every denomination Triumph
[1:05:39] overall paganism a living God made
[1:05:41] manifest in the living Temple and the
[1:05:43] word of God which is God is made flesh
[1:05:45] in you amen
[1:05:47] why you're seated in Heavenly places yes
[1:05:50] when was the time that the sons of God
[1:05:51] was ever to be manifested outside of
[1:05:53] this time now
[1:05:54] matter of fact what manifest God not
[1:05:56] manifest the devil
[1:05:59] a time to deliver all nature what nature
[1:06:01] you worried about mine are yours
[1:06:04] yours this is correcting our false
[1:06:06] nature yes
[1:06:12] if you like yourself today pray for me
[1:06:15] I don't like me
[1:06:16] I don't like myself
[1:06:19] but we're getting there
[1:06:22] nature the nature itself is groaning
[1:06:24] waiting for the time of manifestation
[1:06:26] who who's he waiting on
[1:06:27] who'd you waiting on me and you
[1:06:30] it's not waiting on for the clouds to
[1:06:32] come or the earthquakes to happen no
[1:06:34] that's all happening because we're
[1:06:36] sitting on our can not doing anything
[1:06:42] spirit of God coming into these men so
[1:06:45] perfectly until their ministry will be
[1:06:47] so close to Christ they'll join him and
[1:06:49] his church together him and his bride
[1:06:51] yes
[1:06:53] now we read The Sixth Seal that's what
[1:06:55] we listen we got to have a six seal
[1:06:57] sanctification here before they can have
[1:06:59] one in the Earth and before the two
[1:07:02] prophets can come we've got to have all
[1:07:04] that we've got to have a total
[1:07:06] Destruction of nature it's the power of
[1:07:08] God to interrupt nature he's doing it
[1:07:11] right now
[1:07:16] I'm not worried about out there yet
[1:07:21] the sixth Hill is completely an
[1:07:22] interruption of nature your nature
[1:07:25] he said there's your seal
[1:07:28] the prophet's on the other side of the
[1:07:29] Rapture but we got to have it on this
[1:07:31] side
[1:07:33] we gotta have it on this side
[1:07:35] we got to see that the Seal's open the
[1:07:37] seal is open to me and you so that we
[1:07:39] can live this thing
[1:07:41] see what the seal is as those two
[1:07:43] prophets so if we're going to get
[1:07:44] anything from God it's got to come from
[1:07:45] a prophet
[1:07:48] a mouthpiece of God in other words
[1:07:50] somebody that don't have their own ideas
[1:07:51] they only move theirself out of the way
[1:07:54] and God uses you know many times brother
[1:07:56] Brown said I don't know what I just said
[1:07:59] now a lot of us do that because we're
[1:08:01] old
[1:08:02] man included
[1:08:04] what'd I just say
[1:08:06] but he was so moved out he so give
[1:08:08] himself to God so he just moved out of
[1:08:10] the way and God spoke everything needed
[1:08:12] to be spoke 100 truth every time not one
[1:08:15] time was it wrong and I'm not talking
[1:08:17] about you know what we could have really
[1:08:19] if he was just a flash in a pan and you
[1:08:21] know just a couple of years you know he
[1:08:22] had a couple prayer lines and and he and
[1:08:25] he and he guessed and got it right
[1:08:28] no he had 30 years
[1:08:31] 30 years of standing there and said if
[1:08:35] God be God let him come on the scene
[1:08:38] right now and that thousands of people
[1:08:41] were healed thousands of people give
[1:08:43] testimony not just a few here and there
[1:08:47] thousands of people
[1:08:49] he affected this whole world
[1:08:52] seven times he went around the world
[1:08:56] so let's read psalms 42 7. we'll get to
[1:08:58] this right here and we'll quit
[1:09:02] deep calleth into the deep
[1:09:05] that's a noise of what
[1:09:07] thy water spout
[1:09:10] not mine
[1:09:14] he is
[1:09:16] all thy waves and thy Billows are gone
[1:09:18] over me
[1:09:19] Prophet God said now look
[1:09:21] when the Deep calls to the Deep this is
[1:09:23] actually comes from the video that we
[1:09:26] have of him in Washington DC preaching
[1:09:28] the decal to deep this is in it right
[1:09:29] here 1954.
[1:09:32] when the Deep calls to the Deep before
[1:09:34] there can be a deep call
[1:09:36] before God wrote the Bible
[1:09:40] he knew what we would need and put it
[1:09:43] there yes
[1:09:45] he just took man to write it and then
[1:09:48] God put it together for us and then man
[1:09:50] got it all scrupled up then it took a
[1:09:52] prophet to come in the end time to bring
[1:09:54] all those loose ends together and for us
[1:09:56] to get in line and start walking again
[1:09:58] like the bride did in the first churches
[1:10:00] laughs
[1:10:02] before I can beat called has to be a
[1:10:04] deed to respond
[1:10:05] people a few years ago it probably was
[1:10:07] Sinners maybe you were in some formal
[1:10:09] church that did not believe in the
[1:10:10] baptism of the Holy Spirit but you heard
[1:10:12] the message
[1:10:13] there was something in there that called
[1:10:15] out for more of God yes
[1:10:21] you might have been living in a
[1:10:22] Justified State before God
[1:10:25] but you wanted the baptism of the Holy
[1:10:27] Spirit
[1:10:31] I knew I needed it
[1:10:34] do you know you need it
[1:10:37] amen
[1:10:39] if not there's not a deep in there to
[1:10:41] call out
[1:10:42] you might have been living in a
[1:10:44] Justified State before God but you
[1:10:46] wanted the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:10:48] you hungered for it
[1:10:51] now the very reason that there's a holy
[1:10:53] spirit is because you are a hungry boy
[1:10:56] you would never hunger for it unless
[1:10:58] there was something in here to call for
[1:11:02] it out there
[1:11:05] man's had natural knowledge let me cover
[1:11:07] this real quick
[1:11:08] because there's a deep desire for man
[1:11:11] you look at that first thing he says car
[1:11:16] man had a cart man had a boogie man had
[1:11:19] a horse-driven carriage man had a
[1:11:22] trolley man wanted more why he had a
[1:11:25] deep he wanted to go that way
[1:11:26] he wanted to go see his neighbors and
[1:11:28] didn't have to take three days to get
[1:11:29] there
[1:11:30] right
[1:11:31] yeah that was his desire but what is
[1:11:33] that worldly knowledge done natural
[1:11:34] knowledge more people we worry about
[1:11:37] covet
[1:11:39] read your statistics as more people die
[1:11:41] in car wrecks
[1:11:43] than they do have covered so let's get
[1:11:45] around the car
[1:11:48] no you will not get rid of your car I
[1:11:50] promise you and I promise you if you're
[1:11:52] an American today you got two or three
[1:11:54] one ain't enough
[1:11:56] so see what that worldly knowledge
[1:11:58] natural knowledge is still a deep call
[1:12:01] man looks up in the sky
[1:12:04] way back when they said they write the
[1:12:06] Bible as brother around says then they
[1:12:08] look at that North Star and they shoot
[1:12:10] it and they're able to sail where they
[1:12:12] need to go
[1:12:14] but man's gotta desire I want to get
[1:12:16] there faster
[1:12:18] what's on that little ball up there
[1:12:21] so what'd they do they made a rocket
[1:12:25] that fuel that they put in the car
[1:12:27] they formulated a little different they
[1:12:29] put in a rocket
[1:12:31] electricity
[1:12:33] if both levels here he'd tell you and
[1:12:35] probably some of your older ones
[1:12:36] remember when there wasn't any
[1:12:39] but man had a deep desire to have
[1:12:42] electricity
[1:12:43] and look even now we were talking
[1:12:45] yesterday June's dad now a day before
[1:12:47] yesterday you look look what LED's done
[1:12:49] to this world
[1:12:51] I mean I'm old enough to remember the
[1:12:53] old light bulb and I'm telling you I'm
[1:12:55] telling you if you touched it
[1:12:58] you gotta burn
[1:12:59] all right didn't matter if it's 50 watt
[1:13:02] 60 watt or whatever it was if you if
[1:13:04] you'd be doing this time try to get that
[1:13:06] thing off right because it was hot
[1:13:10] now led
[1:13:18] just a little bit of tangle a little bit
[1:13:20] worn
[1:13:21] see what man's done man said we don't
[1:13:23] want that anymore because you know what
[1:13:24] if we had 100 light bulbs in here of the
[1:13:26] old type it are in here so man says hey
[1:13:29] it's hot
[1:13:32] pepper we're gonna make it when we put a
[1:13:34] little chip in it because you know what
[1:13:35] we made that chip to go in the computer
[1:13:38] man deep cause of the deep he needs to
[1:13:40] defend something brother Brian said it's
[1:13:43] a thirst
[1:13:45] look at gunpowder
[1:13:47] man shot bows and arrows and they
[1:13:49] couldn't hit anything but about 20 yards
[1:13:51] don't know what you call an Indian can't
[1:13:52] shoot a bow right
[1:13:55] a vegetarian
[1:13:59] but you had Bose shot 20 yards and and
[1:14:01] you'd have to sneak up and get right on
[1:14:04] him man said I need a desire to get
[1:14:07] further away from that animal so I can
[1:14:09] take more game
[1:14:10] so the Chinese put sulfur in this all
[1:14:12] together and gunpowder
[1:14:14] gunpowder now kills more people
[1:14:17] according to Wars and and stuff than
[1:14:20] anything else to
[1:14:21] besides cars
[1:14:23] so the thing that man's making to make
[1:14:25] us more convenient is killing us
[1:14:28] processed food oh don't go there by the
[1:14:30] way
[1:14:31] well I'm going to anyway processed foods
[1:14:33] what's killing us brother Ryan said wife
[1:14:35] wife killing us
[1:14:40] [Music]
[1:14:42] election days like three months
[1:14:46] for roast beef
[1:14:48] you keep milk for two and a half weeks
[1:14:50] now Lord my mom would buy it we'd have
[1:14:53] to drink it in the week we'd be gone I
[1:14:54] mean it'd be um
[1:14:56] unless you just use it for buttermilk
[1:14:58] then because we didn't have a place we
[1:14:59] just go get buttermilk we didn't have a
[1:15:01] Walmart but you see what a man by what I
[1:15:03] mean even a natural knowledge it's a
[1:15:06] knowledge that God give man to progress
[1:15:09] and get better look at War now you're in
[1:15:12] electronics my Heavens Electronics
[1:15:14] Richard and them can buy something and
[1:15:16] what Rich one year like six months can I
[1:15:18] say six months is that exaggerating six
[1:15:20] months later obsolete well where was it
[1:15:23] it was laying there the whole time
[1:15:24] that's right what are you saying brother
[1:15:27] wait it was laying there in you the
[1:15:28] whole time
[1:15:29] the knowledge
[1:15:31] that you needed God
[1:15:33] not a seed not an eternal life but a
[1:15:35] knowledge that you needed God
[1:15:39] give man knowledge to use
[1:15:41] to make us more convenient
[1:15:44] look at War now used to years ago
[1:15:48] when you had the the medieval Wars and
[1:15:51] all that man it was hand-to-hand combat
[1:15:52] right and then they come up with a
[1:15:54] crossbow they can shoot them a little
[1:15:55] bit further then they come up with this
[1:15:57] they come up with gun powders they could
[1:15:59] blow you up a little bit further and
[1:16:01] then you then you got foot soldiers and
[1:16:03] then you got a tank and Mary's laughing
[1:16:05] because you know where I'm going you
[1:16:07] don't even have to be in a battlefield
[1:16:08] now you'll be 10 miles that's right
[1:16:12] you'd be 100 miles away
[1:16:17] and then you can have a drone you can go
[1:16:18] you can go out too you can just rain
[1:16:20] drones without why electronics man has
[1:16:23] tried his best to live by that knowledge
[1:16:27] of the tree of knowledge of Good and
[1:16:28] Evil he is only killing kill himself
[1:16:31] but praise
[1:16:34] you this took us away from all that I
[1:16:37] don't worry about war
[1:16:39] somebody the other day this gets me
[1:16:43] you look at the world and
[1:16:45] you know you can't watch a movie now
[1:16:46] somebody says let's go have a drink not
[1:16:48] us but the people in the movie let's
[1:16:50] grab a drink let's grab a drink let's
[1:16:51] grab a drink
[1:16:52] water is good enough for me
[1:16:55] why do you have to go take a drink and
[1:16:56] stop somebody
[1:16:57] why because Satan has got in man's mind
[1:17:00] and that's what he's programming
[1:17:02] that we have to do this that we can do
[1:17:04] this that it's okay to do that it's okay
[1:17:05] to you know like Bob said present
[1:17:08] yourself naked to the world
[1:17:09] men and women
[1:17:13] right but that's what God's put in there
[1:17:16] he's put a he's put a he's put a place
[1:17:18] so we can have Holy Ghost knowledge or
[1:17:20] we can have Earthly knowledge and listen
[1:17:22] we need some Earthly knowledge to
[1:17:25] survive in this world
[1:17:27] kids you need Earthly knowledge you need
[1:17:29] to go to school you need to learn you
[1:17:31] need to do what they tell you to do the
[1:17:32] curriculum that they have so that you
[1:17:35] can survive in this world but I'll
[1:17:37] promise you it will have an end also
[1:17:41] the Bible says ever knowing
[1:17:44] but not coming to the knowledge of the
[1:17:46] truth ever learning
[1:17:48] that's what man's done he's learned this
[1:17:50] it's learned that it's learned all these
[1:17:51] things but to have the knowledge of God
[1:17:54] it's the greatest thing we can have and
[1:17:57] that knowledge is that knowledge right
[1:17:58] there the knowledge
[1:18:00] that you need God
[1:18:02] more than you need anything in this
[1:18:03] world
[1:18:05] anything
[1:18:07] and that deef that calls you
[1:18:10] there's already something to respond
[1:18:14] let me read you this real quick
[1:18:17] then we'll close musicians get ready to
[1:18:18] come I was trying to get to this but
[1:18:22] I'm going to skip over because I can do
[1:18:24] that
[1:18:26] see how far down it was I'm I'm so slow
[1:18:28] getting this gracious
[1:18:31] but listen this right here
[1:18:38] this is from regardless evil age let's
[1:18:40] stand our feet
[1:18:41] what would God call a people out of this
[1:18:44] evil age for
[1:18:46] his name
[1:18:48] the reason it is is to try her yes
[1:18:53] whoa
[1:18:55] to try her his bride yes
[1:18:58] when she has made manifest been tried
[1:19:00] been proven proved to Satan
[1:19:03] like it was at the beginning so shall it
[1:19:06] be at the end as the seed starts in the
[1:19:09] ground and comes up to carriers life of
[1:19:11] it but it ends up the same seed it was
[1:19:14] when he was putting the ground in the
[1:19:16] same way the seed of Deceit fell in the
[1:19:18] Garden of Eden
[1:19:19] it's the same way it ends up in the last
[1:19:21] days
[1:19:22] just as the gospel was when it fell in
[1:19:25] denomination that nazia Rome it ends up
[1:19:27] in that same super organization just as
[1:19:30] the seed of the church fell back there
[1:19:32] with the signs and wonders of living
[1:19:33] Christ among them it ends up the last
[1:19:35] days under that same Ministry the
[1:19:37] ministry of Malachi for it and restores
[1:19:40] back again the original Faith listen
[1:19:41] we're living under the original Faith
[1:19:43] we're living on the same faith that
[1:19:45] Peter had same faith that Paul had same
[1:19:48] faith that James had did it all have the
[1:19:49] same effect
[1:19:52] Hallelujah
[1:19:54] we find out this evil age is what to
[1:19:56] prove to Satan he is not like Eve
[1:20:00] that she's not that type of a woman
[1:20:03] and she will be Tried by his word
[1:20:06] the bride is Adam's bride was tried
[1:20:09] by the word
[1:20:11] bride believed every bit of it but one
[1:20:13] thing
[1:20:15] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:20:17] forever
[1:20:18] failed on One Promise under the
[1:20:20] temptation of the enemy face to face and
[1:20:22] now the people has called for his name
[1:20:24] of course is his bride she is to come in
[1:20:27] contact Again by the same thing not by
[1:20:31] just denominational truth or something
[1:20:32] but every w o r d
[1:20:36] listen
[1:20:37] I put that right there
[1:20:41] how many of you can say God's proud of
[1:20:43] you
[1:20:45] because you know job's sitting there one
[1:20:47] day
[1:20:48] minding his own business
[1:20:51] he had all his cows in one lot he had
[1:20:54] his camels he had his kids safe in the
[1:20:57] house he had a nice wife he had all the
[1:21:00] food he needed he owned everything that
[1:21:03] he needed to sustain himself and he's
[1:21:05] just sitting there
[1:21:06] oblivious to what's fixing to happen
[1:21:11] but God's standing in heaven
[1:21:15] oh he said oh devil come here for a
[1:21:17] second
[1:21:19] if you consider my servant job
[1:21:24] you've got a hedge built around him
[1:21:27] kill him I've tried
[1:21:29] they're all comfortable
[1:21:31] he's got the word wrapped around him
[1:21:33] he's got everything he needs
[1:21:36] he's not he's not a warned of anything
[1:21:41] so he says you just let me at him
[1:21:46] but you know what
[1:21:48] God's standing there and he's not
[1:21:50] smiling on the outside because he's
[1:21:51] holding
[1:21:52] he smiled on the inside
[1:21:54] because remember he knows the end from
[1:21:56] the beginning
[1:22:00] he knows the end from the beginning he
[1:22:02] was proud of job before this ever
[1:22:04] happened
[1:22:06] so he doesn't let you say well no God's
[1:22:08] not proud of me because of well
[1:22:10] look at job
[1:22:12] after that what happened to him
[1:22:14] everybody all his friends all his
[1:22:17] neighbors and even his wife said you've
[1:22:19] done something
[1:22:21] right you've done something you're a
[1:22:23] secret Center you're holding something
[1:22:25] back
[1:22:27] no it wasn't it's just that God wanted
[1:22:29] to prove it job was his yes
[1:22:32] and then he was Pratt listen if he's not
[1:22:35] proud of you that's why I was telling
[1:22:37] about we look at sickness and all these
[1:22:39] different things as God beating you up
[1:22:40] now what about testimony service
[1:22:44] what about God letting your children go
[1:22:46] through what they went through
[1:22:48] they want to be a testimony they
[1:22:50] wouldn't have been a a video a pair of
[1:22:52] aubergine and different ones
[1:22:56] but B Frida sitting there with stage
[1:22:59] four
[1:23:00] still living still breathing
[1:23:03] still worshiping God
[1:23:07] because God's proud of you
[1:23:11] doesn't matter what the situation is
[1:23:15] I want him to be proud of me
[1:23:18] have you considered my servant
[1:23:21] job
[1:23:23] have you considered what we're going
[1:23:25] through in your life today in my life
[1:23:27] today have you considered that that is a
[1:23:29] testimony waiting to happen
[1:23:31] and let me tell you something
[1:23:35] your Daddy has already testified
[1:23:41] your daddy's already wrote it in the
[1:23:42] Bible
[1:23:43] by his stripes you're healed
[1:23:46] I'll save your soul if you'll ask me
[1:23:49] I died for you
[1:23:51] so he already knows he's proud of us
[1:23:53] before he even gets started but you and
[1:23:55] I have to go through that test
[1:23:57] amen so that God can say man
[1:24:01] look devil
[1:24:03] you didn't make him
[1:24:05] do what you said because remember Satan
[1:24:07] said I'll make him curse you and die and
[1:24:09] then his wife even said that and job
[1:24:12] never did
[1:24:13] joke came out on the other side and God
[1:24:15] said I asked my boy he was my boy to
[1:24:17] start with he's my boy now
[1:24:19] because I am proud
[1:24:22] of him
