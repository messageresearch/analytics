[10:37] love of the Brethren see if you love one
[10:41] another with a pure heart fervently
[10:43] being born again not of corruptible seed
[10:46] but of incorruptible how by the Word of
[10:51] God which liveth and abideth for ever
[10:56] alright let's go over to Thessalonians
[10:59] because we're going to kind of just take
[11:01] a little thought in the line here and
[11:03] want to bring it out so from 1st
[11:05] Thessalonians 5 we'll start reading
[11:08] about verse 14 now we exhort you
[11:12] brethren warn them that are unruly
[11:16] comfort the feeble-minded support the
[11:18] weak be patient toward all men see that
[11:22] none render evil for evil unto any man
[11:29] no see that don't say well I can be bad
[11:32] to this guy cause he ain't my brother no
[11:33] such thing any man would ever follow
[11:36] that which is good both among yourselves
[11:39] and to all men rejoice evermore pray
[11:43] without ceasing in everything give
[11:45] thanks for this is the will of God in
[11:48] Christ Jesus concerning you quints not
[11:51] the Spirit despise not prophesying prove
[11:55] all things hold fast that which is good
[11:58] abstain from all appearance of evil and
[12:01] the very God of peace sanctify now once
[12:04] watch the whole thing now because this
[12:06] is our thought let see and the very God
[12:10] of peace sanctify you they didn't just
[12:14] say now the soul or this or that it's
[12:18] holy the whole being all right now cuz
[12:22] that's our thought see and I pray that
[12:25] you're whole
[12:26] and soul and body be preserved blameless
[12:29] unto the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ
[12:32] you may be seated the Lord at his
[12:34] blessing to the reading of the word no
[12:39] we've been covering for quite a while
[12:43] and kind of staying in the line of you
[12:47] know making sure we're getting the line
[12:50] up correctly in the new birth and
[12:53] getting those things to bring us to a
[12:57] position you know then that way when we
[13:02] do get into the talkin of the virtues
[13:05] and the things like that it won't be
[13:08] something there so well we wonder about
[13:10] this what about now you'll see that it's
[13:12] already there because that's what we're
[13:14] trying to speak about all right the
[13:19] prophet of God said when you receive
[13:20] that new birth
[13:21] he said you good everything that you
[13:25] have need of all right but that doesn't
[13:29] mean you've got everything right you've
[13:34] got what the point or the ability or the
[13:37] situation exists then to where that you
[13:41] can receive from God because that nuber
[13:44] just puts you to the place to work you
[13:47] can start your growing right you can
[13:51] start your growing in Christ and and
[13:53] walking in his love and you know and
[13:56] letting him lead us and guide us this is
[13:59] a natural child you know go forth and
[14:03] trying to explain that in the new birth
[14:05] because that to me is the most wonderful
[14:07] thing the new birth the Prophet said
[14:09] it's the most important thing in your
[14:12] life
[14:12] it's whether you're born again or not
[14:14] know that if you have that then he gets
[14:17] into the statue of a perfect man and he
[14:19] says then if you have this faith this
[14:23] new birth and I'll said don't worry
[14:26] about these other things because they'll
[14:29] be automatically added now listen to the
[14:33] wording automatically added he didn't
[14:36] say
[14:36] added automatically
[14:39] that's entirely different when you say
[14:41] they'll be you know they'll be added
[14:43] automatically they automatically add it
[14:47] to different things to your thoughts are
[14:49] different right see then you know
[14:52] they'll be added because there's
[14:55] something in there that can receive you
[15:01] know something can receive the eat the
[15:05] teachings and the walk in Christ and the
[15:09] things and in that way it will bring out
[15:12] what God wants into our hearts and lives
[15:14] all right we'll see it's not just say
[15:16] well I don't have to worry about it
[15:17] cause it'd be automatically added now
[15:19] that wasn't the way that's not the
[15:22] thought the I mean if what you're saying
[15:27] see if people don't realize when they
[15:29] say something what it means on the other
[15:30] side what you're saying is well my wife
[15:33] just had a baby but we don't feed it
[15:35] it's automatically we won't feed it will
[15:41] not do that be automatically added no
[15:45] they you know that's kind of stupidity
[15:47] right well maybe it's a bad word to use
[15:50] but it's true all right you feed the
[15:53] baby all right so what is it in the
[15:56] Christian life you feed the child and
[15:58] it'll grow up into him which is the word
[16:02] all right now doing that in the new
[16:05] birth then see we can follow it and see
[16:08] that God will just keep unveiling that
[16:12] and if he has given you now this was the
[16:15] point last last weekend see if he has
[16:19] given you the new birth he gave it to
[16:21] you for a reason
[16:22] if he has chosen us he chose us for a
[16:26] reason how does God choose well he just
[16:29] hand-picked he just coded I'll get this
[16:31] don't get everything no no how does God
[16:33] choose he chooses by his foreknowledge
[16:39] because that's the way he can
[16:41] predestinate things to take place and
[16:43] that is his choosing is through his
[16:47] foreknowledge not it just a world was
[16:50] laying out and he said I'll take this
[16:51] I'll take that and I'll take it
[16:52] that looks pretty good okay then who
[16:54] does no no no that's not the way God
[16:56] does he looked down through time and saw
[17:00] what we would be and what we would
[17:03] desire and that way he doesn't even
[17:05] predestinate to prophet said by his own
[17:08] desires he predestinated by your desire
[17:14] alright then that's what we were trying
[17:17] to get across you know that there
[17:21] everybody were predestinated unto
[17:24] adoption alright
[17:26] and adoption then is told in three
[17:29] stages we'll go back to that in a second
[17:31] but yet see if there's people
[17:35] predestinated to all places in Christ
[17:39] there is a field you that's
[17:42] predestinated but God's foreknowledge he
[17:44] knows where they'll come to alright
[17:46] there's a foolish virgin that he knows
[17:49] will receive eternal life one day and
[17:51] those are predestinated by his
[17:53] foreknowledge right and siiver then by
[17:56] the same thing you and i are
[17:59] predestinated you remember how we were
[18:01] bringing it some will just receive the
[18:03] new birth praise God that's wonderful
[18:07] because that's their position and that's
[18:10] as high as they can go that's that's the
[18:13] level all right then others are
[18:17] predestinated to reach into
[18:19] manifestation of God you know in growth
[18:23] development into maturity and it will be
[18:27] all up and down the pyramids you know as
[18:29] far as see summer predestinate adjust to
[18:31] the new birth with someone predestinate
[18:33] here and here here and here and here and
[18:35] here and on but somebody is
[18:37] predestinated for it to come to the
[18:41] headstone the capstone the finish of it
[18:44] all all right now that's the group of
[18:46] people I want to be in I'm not going to
[18:49] be disappointed if I don't make it
[18:51] because I know now listen if I don't
[18:55] make it in the change you know the point
[18:58] and live long enough have to go by the
[19:00] gray there's no problem but I know too
[19:03] that I'm the one
[19:05] that will determine it's not God
[19:09] determining who's going to reach that
[19:10] position you sold yes it is he picked he
[19:14] picked specially for that no he picked
[19:18] because there's something special to be
[19:20] picking right
[19:22] he picks because of what he wants to
[19:24] pick he'll bring it to that place all
[19:28] right would it be because somebody
[19:32] believed it I always been in the Bible
[19:35] I've always tried to emphasize that to
[19:37] you it's always been my thoughts then in
[19:40] the Bible God doesn't use this anybody
[19:43] distill what I'll just pick out one no
[19:46] he knows what we will do and thereby he
[19:50] can choose by what he knows we desire
[19:54] but you know you don't amount to
[19:57] anything unless God
[20:01] you know comes to you and he offers it
[20:06] to you it's not that he makes you take
[20:09] salvation it's not he he demands you do
[20:12] this editor he offers it to you all
[20:16] right he knows surely whether you
[20:18] receive it or not yes but he offers it
[20:21] and then as we accept it it can become a
[20:25] part of us and that way we become his
[20:28] offspring his children right and
[20:32] becoming his children then you know he's
[20:36] not just hand picking this or hand
[20:38] taking that he's picking it because of
[20:40] some reason brother Tom Fogg was had a
[20:43] way of saying it about predestination
[20:46] he said you trigger your predestination
[20:48] well you know I mean you you trigger it
[20:51] you you're the one that sets it in
[20:52] motion the God lays before us all things
[20:57] isn't well that don't sound like
[20:59] predestination way I believe it because
[21:01] I think pre that we did predestinate it
[21:04] well you've got a problem because you're
[21:10] profit you know yourself said it if you
[21:12] want he said God doesn't predestinate by
[21:16] his desires because he desired it
[21:19] everybody be saved
[21:21] he doesn't predestinate you know well I
[21:24] won't pick this when I'm gonna pick that
[21:26] one no no he doesn't he has some reason
[21:31] well when are we going to realize that
[21:34] church that has been my desire since I
[21:37] came into the message and begin to see
[21:40] what the Prophet was talking about that
[21:42] God is waiting on somebody and we talk
[21:47] about the Bible today without us or not
[21:49] made perfect you know that they're
[21:50] waiting on well you know what God is
[21:52] waiting on you and other prophets their
[21:56] God waiting on your not yes God is
[21:58] waiting on you and I he's waiting on us
[22:03] to wake up you remember a few weeks ago
[22:05] the message we're out in denominations
[22:09] asleep oh no no we're really up here in
[22:12] a little denomination sleeping
[22:15] wake up and realize you know that we've
[22:20] got to walk in him he's wounding
[22:22] somebody and don't worry about it if we
[22:25] just have the right desire he'll bring
[22:28] it to pass
[22:29] making it manifest in their lives see
[22:33] that's the whole of a Christian journey
[22:36] is not to try to make ourselves known to
[22:39] the world as some kind of a super-duper
[22:41] a group of people or something like that
[22:43] I've never had that dog my thoughts are
[22:47] to make my father known it's always been
[22:51] that way to make my father known I mean
[22:54] maybe God allows things to happen where
[22:56] you come out differ but see my dad died
[22:59] when I was like four well I don't
[23:00] remember him you know you remember your
[23:04] dad your your thing no my mother I can
[23:07] remember but my dad I don't remember him
[23:10] why see maybe God allowed that to take
[23:14] place to her that I would have a
[23:16] thoughts about my father see I want to
[23:21] make my father manifest I thought that's
[23:26] what the Christian journey was far I
[23:29] thought you know that he was to come and
[23:31] live in us to make himself manifest to
[23:35] everybody else and that's been my desire
[23:39] because I you know it's just within me
[23:42] to to want to try to express Jesus
[23:46] Christ to her that you can see him and
[23:50] want to follow after not me what good is
[23:54] it father after each other that's well
[23:56] and good I mean we've got it oh you call
[23:58] them image personalities or something
[24:01] before us you know that we look at
[24:03] things and want to be like that that's
[24:05] not human but being a Christian is to
[24:10] let God live in us to work that he can
[24:14] manifest himself we were listening the
[24:16] other day too to him back and I've told
[24:18] you over and over where that why I'm
[24:21] right people so tossed about 60 I mean
[24:24] 56 you know they're totally that's where
[24:25] brother Adam would start off talking
[24:28] we were listening to the other
[24:29] Jorgenson's and that was part of our
[24:31] talking about and see he says their ins
[24:33] in 56 God walking on two feet
[24:38] God in his people walking on two feet
[24:44] you know I mean that's his desire if
[24:51] there's any desire whatsoever I think
[24:53] about God if he wants his people to make
[24:57] him manifest to where others want to
[25:01] walk in that I know that I hurt feelings
[25:05] and things by saying things but I'm
[25:07] sorry but is it true is it true that
[25:11] maybe sometimes we prove we present the
[25:14] wrong the wrong way even to our families
[25:20] or our children or our brothers and
[25:23] sisters or something this is the reason
[25:25] they don't want this message it's
[25:29] because that we've killed them with the
[25:32] word that we thought we were trying to
[25:34] save them and we wind up burying them
[25:38] instead of saving them but yet still
[25:40] listen the whole goal of a Christian
[25:46] should be to let their father come and
[25:49] live through them Jesus he said I do
[25:54] nothing until my father shows me that
[26:00] was something he was the father but yet
[26:04] he was so into the human connections by
[26:07] the body that he lived with him that he
[26:10] wanted that body to manifest what was
[26:14] with the end we'll get to the message
[26:17] maybe in a minute see to the whole being
[26:22] I believe in salvation for the whole
[26:26] being I mean that we talk about coming
[26:30] to a change of the body well wouldn't
[26:33] that be the point to were that the whole
[26:36] being the whole being that I am I wanted
[26:43] to manifest God to her others can look
[26:46] at it you know the kids the grandkids
[26:48] and think and look at and say what would
[26:50] you know daddy's got a problem that is
[26:54] getting old and he's got a lot of
[26:56] problems but you don't want he still a
[26:58] good Oh daddy you know I mean that's at
[27:02] least what we should have a desire
[27:04] within our heart to be you know and that
[27:07] way then you're not ruling or lording
[27:10] over your children you know right I've
[27:17] never believed in in trying to make
[27:19] anybody do anything no I thought I've
[27:24] always been I know you say well you're
[27:26] wrong okay I'm wrong what I am I'm just
[27:29] me
[27:30] I've never tried to make anybody believe
[27:33] this message I've never tried to make my
[27:37] family believe this message I've always
[27:41] left it before them to work that take it
[27:44] except to reject and really in reality
[27:48] you know the reason I'm preaching today
[27:53] you've heard me say this before so it's
[27:55] not a new thing just wait like I said
[27:56] finish it what am i preaching whoa oh I
[27:59] have one desire in my heart is for
[28:03] somebody to see Jesus Christ you said
[28:09] well what do you mean you preacher I
[28:11] thought it's called a preach hey I'm
[28:14] glad we've got a prophet that we can
[28:16] quote back with like a he said it don't
[28:18] matter if I preach anymore
[28:21] he said I'm saved anyway he said I'm not
[28:25] saved according to what I preach but see
[28:27] the then he would get the benefits of
[28:30] reaping a lot to go with it because of
[28:34] what he would do
[28:34] yes but yet his desire see and that's
[28:39] means my whole desire I've never tried
[28:42] to make my wife when we walked out of
[28:45] the Baptist Church I told her I said you
[28:47] go you do I'll give you money I won't
[28:51] give money back to the church you know I
[28:55] move on but I'll allow you to go there
[28:59] and do whatever because that's your
[29:02] choice so I don't want her following
[29:05] just a book of rules I don't want her
[29:11] following just me has to be a point I
[29:15] want her to follow Jesus Christ
[29:18] all right then something happens to me
[29:21] and I'm taken out of the way she doesn't
[29:25] lose right the she can go on in God and
[29:33] let God lead her that's the way I want a
[29:35] a church to be I want you to be you know
[29:40] love God and do what you do out of love
[29:44] I hate to give orders that's the
[29:48] difference between a Leo and Aries Leo
[29:53] likes to order no an Aries likes to
[29:57] direct
[29:59] you know I'd rather just do it himself
[30:03] then they have to tell somebody do this
[30:07] or do that
[30:09] I'm just not made that way I just go do
[30:11] it themselves and you know that's true
[30:14] see because that's part of my nature
[30:16] alright but it's part of my Christian
[30:18] nature for the one us to be one time to
[30:23] walk in Christ okay
[30:24] okay but now where we're at Sunday in
[30:31] trying to speak about adoption in three
[30:36] stages all right and we were covering
[30:41] that your adoption is covered in three
[30:43] stages all right the new birth authority
[30:48] and then the really it's not the change
[30:53] of the body I've always tried to
[30:55] emphasize that the Bible is really not
[30:56] doing it the change of the body is a
[30:59] mystery Paul come up to spoke of it see
[31:04] it's not a change of the body it's to
[31:06] wit
[31:07] I've always emphasized that in Romans to
[31:10] wit to understand the change see if we
[31:14] understand the change
[31:16] there's no problem with the change right
[31:20] but remember now to be healed you must
[31:23] confess you're healed before you're
[31:26] healed right to be saved you must
[31:31] confess you're saved then God can
[31:34] manifest that all right so he's going to
[31:37] reveal to somebody the change of the
[31:40] body and it's going to take place mm-hmm
[31:45] because it's already the others are in
[31:48] manifestation of the new birth
[31:52] what see then in Romans that's what we
[31:56] were getting at Paul talks in the Romans
[31:58] about the the three stages all right
[32:01] then think about Peter that's what my
[32:04] emphasis has been so much lately till
[32:06] maybe I'm varying too much on it but my
[32:09] emphases is what Paul and Peter James
[32:14] and John Jude any one of them you want
[32:19] to put there ever one with one goal in
[32:23] mind that's to try to get people to
[32:29] Christ all right now listen real careful
[32:34] Jude I mean a Peter noone is are they're
[32:38] not as concerned with getting you saved
[32:42] that's where our mess-ups always been we
[32:47] we were we tried to get everybody saved
[32:49] but we had no growth development right
[32:54] it's like I told him brothers that we
[32:56] were going overseas to a thing in having
[32:59] a meeting with people and I said that's
[33:03] all well and good but that's it next
[33:05] year are you gonna put the same two
[33:07] hundred people back in the same class
[33:09] and teach them the same thing that God
[33:11] was a prophet I said don't do that I
[33:16] said take the 200 that you've taught it
[33:19] this year of God being a prophet move
[33:21] them over into another room and then
[33:23] bring these hundred over here or so if
[33:25] you bring it in and teach them that but
[33:27] let somebody take these on in the word
[33:30] well I do know that happened to happen
[33:35] from a country they sent them word said
[33:39] you've told us about a prophet now tell
[33:42] us what the Prophet taught well see
[33:45] that's the whole point that listen Peter
[33:48] names not as interested in getting you
[33:50] saved as they're interested in the
[33:54] growth development of after you're saved
[33:56] because Peters saying you're born again
[34:01] he said you've got this faith you've
[34:05] come through the corruption that is in
[34:07] the world and come to Jesus Christ
[34:09] you've come to that but now let's don't
[34:12] just keep moving on that let's go on and
[34:17] Christ in a growth development all right
[34:20] isn't that what Paul was doing adoption
[34:23] okay this is what you become a child of
[34:26] God by faith in Jesus Christ you become
[34:30] a child of God but now let's go on
[34:35] the there's where the problem brother
[34:39] Brennan said you Pentecostals he said
[34:42] that's where you messed up he said
[34:45] thinking the new birth and you got that
[34:47] and all that was well and good he said
[34:49] he said but you've got to go on
[34:55] what do you mean brother down I go to
[34:58] church I pray I do everything what do
[35:01] you want me to do you know the only
[35:07] thing I want you to do is just me what
[35:08] you're supposed to be which is a
[35:10] Christian right and Peter and Paul Anil
[35:16] see all they're not as much trying to
[35:18] get you born again is they're trying to
[35:21] teach you after you're born again to
[35:25] move on in God and not just set back but
[35:32] yet that's the hardest thing in the
[35:33] world because it's always been thrilled
[35:34] to me well we need simple teaching of
[35:37] the new birth all right then I start
[35:39] like this and a series of simple
[35:41] teaching than you'd understand
[35:42] this wouldn't want I thought this would
[35:46] the way I meant for it to be broad you
[35:49] say well is it true did you say what I
[35:54] want no you you wanted some way that you
[35:57] thought was to bring it I can only do as
[36:01] me I'm not I'm honest I've never been
[36:04] one to deal with trying to get people to
[36:07] the altar for salvation now I do because
[36:10] I'm doing but my interest is in after
[36:14] you get to the altar is to try to teach
[36:19] us to walk in Christ and come forth as
[36:25] children of God they don't have to be
[36:28] patted and pampered and things like that
[36:30] that's why that I've always been a sorry
[36:34] but you know the way I've always been
[36:36] you come to this church by volunteering
[36:39] I didn't go out and get you if you don't
[36:42] want to come to this church that's fine
[36:45] there's no problems but there's one
[36:49] thing about it if you leave I'm not
[36:50] gonna try to chase you down I'm sorry I
[36:55] mean that's what pastors is posted oh
[36:58] brother Dale well maybe I'm not a pastor
[37:02] then but that's just Matt my way
[37:05] I expect children to act like children
[37:09] you know what I do I mean I don't
[37:12] there's the kids know it these little
[37:14] ones until I get out and play with them
[37:16] especially used to younger I really did
[37:19] let's see I I don't expect him to be
[37:24] halos all of their whole life you know
[37:30] just walk in one straight line I didn't
[37:33] walk it and you didn't walk it so don't
[37:36] start with me I've always told you you
[37:41] know we had our ducktail haircuts
[37:43] we had our bell bottom pants if we just
[37:51] kept them we'd be in style cause they
[37:55] were hanging off of that back no but you
[38:00] see I don't throw off on the children
[38:04] telling me oh you you've gotta be snow
[38:07] you talk to her about Jesus Christ you
[38:10] don't talk to him about how God hates
[38:12] this and hates Addison and don't you do
[38:15] that because God God don't like that God
[38:17] to be mean to you I mean you making him
[38:20] mad don't do that
[38:25] you remember when you came to Christ did
[38:28] that do much good in your life it sure
[38:31] did it run you off you had to get over
[38:35] it
[38:36] right so I wrote a run said don't do it
[38:39] he said don't go down and that all I'm
[38:41] gonna group and get that person and try
[38:43] to make them come to the altar he said
[38:46] cause you're gonna make him a twofold
[38:47] child he said because it's gonna be
[38:49] harder the next time try to get you to
[38:50] come to the okay just trying to express
[38:55] what I believe about Christianity and
[38:58] what we should be and adoption is taught
[39:03] there in three stages to where we would
[39:05] have something to understand so then the
[39:08] stature of a perfect man is in three
[39:10] stages new birth all right
[39:13] growth development manifestation of sons
[39:16] and daughters of God and then God coming
[39:18] and capping the whole thing off into our
[39:21] Bible that way if you read the New
[39:23] Testament every one of the writings
[39:25] there was trying their best there were
[39:27] not novices to just try to get you to be
[39:30] born again even the corrections even the
[39:33] raw are the Corinthians
[39:37] the Corinthians was written to
[39:39] Christians the whole Bible is written to
[39:42] Christians it's not written to sinners
[39:46] sinners receive it by seeing people as
[39:50] they and like I said with always been
[39:52] one a revival what was it for it was to
[39:58] revive those that were in Christ that
[40:01] others may see Christ and want to come
[40:04] and follow in their that's the revival
[40:07] no no revival get all that well now see
[40:10] that you've still got that old
[40:11] denominational thought well we need to
[40:16] disprove simple things to get the
[40:18] children but around preach souls in
[40:22] prison and the hall-door fool
[40:31] you understand what I'm getting at he
[40:34] preached some deep messages an altar
[40:36] before the why but calls us in Christ
[40:42] see we think we've got it all figured
[40:45] out and what see our problem is is not
[40:48] accepting it and moving on with God okay
[40:51] so with what we found out that we're
[40:55] predestinated to certain positions all
[40:59] right and when that position is reached
[41:01] in Christ I've always taught you tried
[41:04] to get you to believe when Martin Luther
[41:07] saw what he saw it was a position and
[41:13] when he reached that position he lived a
[41:18] while longer right but it was cause he
[41:21] was preaching that just shall live by
[41:23] faith
[41:23] but before sanctification moved into the
[41:27] picture
[41:28] Luther went off for the scene to where
[41:31] Wesley could come on the scene right
[41:37] because see that was as far as Luther
[41:40] could go but that was in Christ that
[41:43] sealed him away put him to the place
[41:45] he's supposed to be that was his
[41:47] position brother Owen said what about
[41:50] that great glorious stain
[41:54] he said adoption he's done adoption is
[41:58] that great glorious stand predestination
[42:02] to realize you and I our concern our
[42:08] thoughts should not be now listen our
[42:12] concerns could not be just to get people
[42:16] saved
[42:18] that was the ages and times I thought
[42:25] should be to get people who growth
[42:27] development to walking in Christ to
[42:32] realize what Christ is wanting to be
[42:34] done
[42:35] can you see as I said somebody's gonna
[42:37] come to a place one day and they're
[42:40] gonna see it because Roman says it
[42:43] there's to the adoption to wit to
[42:48] understand I know what it goes into
[42:50] we're into this and we did and that's
[42:52] right alright but spiritually what is it
[42:55] to understand the redemption of the body
[43:00] and you realize then what a wonderful
[43:05] place that we stand in that God has
[43:09] given to you and I the message of the
[43:12] hour and you see why I emphasize that so
[43:15] much from 327 Church age book or this
[43:18] messenger Malachi for Luke 17 30 I'll
[43:21] gonna do two thing one turned the hearts
[43:23] of the children back to the faith of the
[43:27] fathers the faith of the fathers is to
[43:31] read this those writings by the Apostles
[43:35] that would try to bring Christ into
[43:38] being
[43:42] that was their goal for that day but to
[43:46] the ages that begin to die down and as
[43:49] it died down see then it just come forth
[43:52] with people just what we need to be
[43:54] saved we don't need these other things
[43:55] we don't need these deep things we we
[43:57] just need to be saved well all that's
[44:01] well and good but you're just saying I
[44:04] need my baby
[44:05] I'm my baby was born I want it to stay
[44:07] to pi on three pound five minutes I
[44:10] don't want the drawing on that you're
[44:14] not realizing that's what we're saying
[44:15] we'll see the return back
[44:17] all right then the Prophet said how do
[44:19] we get these virtues he said in he was
[44:25] to reveal the seven thunders which the
[44:27] revelation contained in the seven Seth
[44:28] and these it'll be these divinely
[44:30] revealed mystery truths that literally
[44:32] turn us back so if we want to be turned
[44:35] back to the faith of the father's we
[44:36] want to see God move on then why are we
[44:39] afraid to try to hear deeper things well
[44:47] I don't want to be confused honey you
[44:48] already are so don't worry about that
[44:51] when you say it like that you already
[44:53] confused I said something the other day
[44:56] and I said I'm looking at it right here
[44:58] we'll see that that's this but listen
[45:08] everybody is predestinated to a position
[45:11] in Christ you follow isn't it okay
[45:15] everybody's predestinated to a position
[45:17] in Christ and the prophet called it
[45:22] crisis a mystery of God revealed
[45:23] paragraph 182 through 188 right in there
[45:27] read all of that
[45:28] that great glorious stand predestinated
[45:33] of people into adoption all right just
[45:38] being predestinated to be a little babe
[45:40] in Christ that's a great position to be
[45:44] involved in a growth development of
[45:46] Christianity to walk in our lives until
[45:49] we be no more his house to and fro by
[45:52] every wind of doctrine what keeps you
[45:55] from being took up into these doctrines
[45:57] and ideas well brother den I've got
[46:01] caught and if you think well maybe you
[46:02] ought to consider what you're doing you
[46:05] know I mean maybe you ought to consider
[46:12] the fact that you need to follow into
[46:14] Christ and Ernie learn a little bit more
[46:17] about the word all right see that might
[46:21] be something to keep us from getting
[46:22] caught by these strange doctrines
[46:25] because I thought that's what it was
[46:29] that the Christian life should walk in
[46:31] Christ and that Holy Ghost should keep
[46:34] us away from strange doctrines now we're
[46:39] human and we fall for things yes but
[46:43] then we need to move on in Christ to
[46:46] where we don't fall for these things
[46:48] there's your faith of the father's
[46:52] is not a group of people standing here
[46:55] in the end of the world and people
[46:57] saying well you know if we had what we
[47:00] think we've got then you know Y&T
[47:02] miracles you know why because of that
[47:03] very statement because we're doubting
[47:06] who we are we're doubting what God is
[47:10] doing I thought I was explaining this to
[47:14] my wife
[47:15] I thought I believe in the people right
[47:17] over there if God came down over there
[47:19] in that church and healed every person
[47:22] in that building one prior and every one
[47:26] of them was healed
[47:27] I wouldn't go over there to see what
[47:32] kind of doctrine or whatever I would
[47:35] thank God for his healing that he done I
[47:38] would praise him for what he's doing
[47:41] among the people but I just walk home
[47:47] yeah but I don't you look look there's
[47:51] nobody that's builder that needs healing
[47:52] any more than then we all need some form
[47:55] of healing yes but we can't make God do
[48:00] it but we can hinder him doing it see
[48:08] like I said if everybody over that would
[48:10] heal people that run over there let's go
[48:12] see what they got well that means you
[48:16] ain't got very much if you're going to
[48:17] looking for something is that the best
[48:19] way to say it I just say praise God
[48:24] because I've taught it from the
[48:27] beginning and I'll keep on teaching you
[48:30] one day the Prophet said God will anoint
[48:33] a church and he'll do in one year or
[48:36] what theologists try to do in 2000 but
[48:38] said he's doing it now alright now I've
[48:42] always looked for that he's always you
[48:44] know the quotes have always give you
[48:46] they'll come set your baptism with the
[48:48] Holy Ghost from heaven that'll feel
[48:50] every fiber of our being and take us in
[48:52] the rapture
[48:53] I've always quoted those as believing it
[48:55] right because I believe that will take
[49:00] place but I've always said this at the
[49:03] same time God will be revealing
[49:06] his bride and she will be coming into
[49:09] her full full future you know full
[49:12] fruits coming into maturity as she does
[49:16] the world's going the religious world of
[49:19] grandfather see there's the deception
[49:25] now I didn't write the book the Bible
[49:29] says this is what I sent among you to
[49:32] try you is that scriptural right I sent
[49:37] this among you to try you want to see
[49:41] whether you'll stay with the word or in
[49:43] hot what you see are we going to take
[49:49] the word I thought the whole thing come
[49:52] down you look at the prophets ministry
[49:54] thirty thousand one meeting thirty
[49:58] thousand come to Jesus Christ in one
[50:00] meeting but when he ended his ministry
[50:04] couldn't get thirty people together
[50:08] right now which is the greatest come on
[50:19] so you're into that flim flam's you love
[50:23] a fire with with your thinking yeah I
[50:26] want 30,000 did the profit turn around
[50:29] and walk back and say well we've been
[50:31] wrong I've chewed you pentecostals out
[50:34] and calls you this and that and the
[50:35] other
[50:36] so we'll just go back to the hour and
[50:37] we'll just go back down here where we're
[50:40] getting all of this movement going we're
[50:42] getting really the movement of God and
[50:44] which way we move with it did he do that
[50:51] the further he went the smaller the
[50:54] crowds right why was that not to move of
[51:03] God come on
[51:07] so which was God won't to be up here
[51:10] with bringing a message that he brought
[51:12] through the Prophet in the sealed book
[51:14] and said I've seen the dead raised the
[51:17] sick healed a great sound and wonderful
[51:20] he said but never worked in the room
[51:22] like this well no you think he'd walk
[51:26] backward well brother branham you won't
[51:30] sit healed and dead raises on the other
[51:32] don't know let's go back there what
[51:35] would he say it he just said y'all go
[51:38] ahead I'm just gonna go on the way I am
[51:40] because this is the way God's leading me
[51:45] right let's see we think it's got to be
[51:49] signs and wonders that's what I kept
[51:53] emphasizing that message about revival
[51:55] this is a revival of God's Word
[52:00] well here it goes though when if we had
[52:03] the word did without signs and wonders
[52:05] Oh see don't quote too much with me cuz
[52:10] all right I'm old and arrogant and
[52:13] hateful and I'll remind you that the
[52:18] Lord Jesus had to take people out of
[52:23] side of the city the Lord Jesus couldn't
[52:27] heal the cause of the people that was
[52:29] dark
[52:31] don't quote with me I'm pretty good at
[52:34] it okay arrogant and hateful yes sir but
[52:38] I'm dying to do one thing to see a
[52:41] people that will stand on God's Word
[52:47] come on is it in the Bible see we quote
[52:50] one scripture where if a prophet tells
[52:52] you anything in the name of a prophet
[52:54] and it comes to pice didn't you supposed
[52:56] to believe it right Amen we believe that
[52:58] that scripture but what about the
[53:00] scripture were that if he sends signs
[53:02] and wonders among you and he take you to
[53:05] another God said don't do it he said
[53:11] cause I sent him among you to try you
[53:14] see we quote what we want a quote we
[53:17] make what we want to make out of the
[53:19] gospel instead of listening to God in
[53:23] his word
[53:25] you to a preacher in the gospel that
[53:29] really stays with words not popular in
[53:31] this message because the people don't
[53:33] know what you're doing
[53:36] they want the signs and the wonders and
[53:38] the moving then is it right am i right
[53:52] see then which one is it which is your
[53:56] desire to be a child of God will stay
[54:01] with God's Word it doesn't make no
[54:02] difference what all the signs and
[54:03] wonders takes place because come on
[54:06] Church you don't realize what the Bible
[54:08] to say he said I sent them among you to
[54:11] try you
[54:11] God sent among us that's what I'm
[54:17] getting at when you do come to the
[54:19] places of God moving in the bride in the
[54:22] way that he said he would do it's going
[54:25] to move everywhere else and how are you
[54:27] going to know the to so people is going
[54:30] to say I told you my message is right
[54:33] God is doing signs and wonders seven
[54:35] Thunder Birchers any message any any
[54:38] doctrine that you got even to all of
[54:42] this stuff now I'll do the claiming
[54:44] brother branham's out and ever since
[54:46] either we got signs and wonders
[54:50] and said we done declared the all that
[54:52] brother branham was false prophet y'all
[54:54] didn't believe us we said now we got
[54:55] signs and wonders brother Daryl you mean
[55:00] to tell me yes sir I've always looked
[55:05] for one time for God to move among his
[55:09] people and manifest himself the way he
[55:15] wants to I've always believed it I
[55:21] always look for because I believe in the
[55:26] mind the signs and the miracles and the
[55:28] wonders I believe in Christ but yet it's
[55:36] so hard to get people to settle down to
[55:38] just listen check what somebody says by
[55:44] the word instead of checking them by
[55:48] your feelings or your ideas
[55:51] well that brother I just didn't feel
[55:54] good while he was preaching so I don't
[55:55] believe he was of God you might be
[55:57] turning down the very one that God was
[56:01] using right I thought as children of God
[56:08] that the things that were supposed to be
[56:11] done was for children to grow up that we
[56:17] be not tossed to and fro by every wind
[56:21] of doctrine
[56:28] see that's the point that will come down
[56:32] til somebody will stand one day
[56:35] and they'll say I and my father are one
[56:43] is that your words of the Prophet well
[56:49] who do you think you are well who do you
[56:51] think you are that's no problem see God
[56:59] is going to vindicate his bride I've
[57:02] always believed that I've always looked
[57:04] forward to it maybe not the way
[57:06] everybody else is believing it's going
[57:08] to take pleasure no but I've always
[57:10] looked for God to move on the scene and
[57:15] he's never failed me yet to move on the
[57:19] scene when I asked him so you can do
[57:22] what you want to or think what you want
[57:24] but you know yourself you can't come up
[57:26] to me and say you fathered this doctor
[57:28] and you went after that you went after
[57:30] this you went after that none of them
[57:32] doctor has ever affected me and I
[57:35] studied them to see what they were to
[57:39] find out what they were because you
[57:42] don't want to turn something down you
[57:44] might be turning down the very word of
[57:45] God so you better check it huh what you
[57:51] see then what are you doing what brother
[57:53] day I'm looking for a group of people to
[57:55] stand on this earth that will say I and
[57:58] my father are one and brother run said
[58:02] in these other things you know oh that's
[58:05] that's bringing forth the truth of the
[58:07] word of God and to declare that Jesus
[58:10] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[58:11] forever
[58:14] and not walk away because that we get
[58:17] caught by some little doctrine or idea
[58:19] you know but to come to the place to
[58:25] really understand the full plan of
[58:29] redemption to where it would come forth
[58:34] then we could look at the Bible and to
[58:38] see this sad to see Peter saying one
[58:45] thing but run said Paul did say
[58:48] something different
[58:51] Paul's teaching the same thing that
[58:54] Peter was teaching Peter's teaching the
[58:56] same things James was teaching all of
[58:59] the adoption is the statue of a perfect
[59:06] man bring it on back to the simple one
[59:09] of what the fruits of the spirit is love
[59:14] joy peace goodness meekness
[59:15] long-suffering the fruits of the spirit
[59:20] is love joy peace goodness meekness
[59:24] right they've read all of the scriptures
[59:31] but come back to the basis of the
[59:34] message to her they would look in
[59:37] Ephesians where it tells us to grow up
[59:41] in here to him and who is he the word
[59:45] visions for
[59:50] that we make grows our by Peter says
[59:54] what the revealed word to grow to where
[59:59] you won't be deceived by all of these
[1:00:01] doctrines yes but I
[1:00:05] I enjoy the move of God amen
[1:00:10] well what if you've got to move on God
[1:00:13] without God being in it
[1:00:21] me
[1:00:23] then what have you got see the whole
[1:00:28] entire Bible is based upon one thing and
[1:00:34] that is truly whether or not God is real
[1:00:42] right see then if God is real
[1:00:46] he'll make itself manifest well all
[1:00:52] right if he's not then he won't but
[1:00:54] listen then this is lifestyle we talk
[1:01:01] about the adding of the virtues and
[1:01:04] things to the individual all right
[1:01:07] and we believe in that so we'll get into
[1:01:11] that next as we cover what virtue is and
[1:01:13] knowledge and temperance and thing and
[1:01:15] move on in the word but the main thing I
[1:01:19] want to end it with is one thought God
[1:01:24] lives in a trying being he himself is a
[1:01:30] crown being right body spirit soul God
[1:01:36] is real
[1:01:37] he's a triune being now to do that as a
[1:01:40] triune being to understand it then he
[1:01:43] had to come in human flesh alright so
[1:01:48] then the soul of the Lord Jesus was
[1:01:52] Almighty God right the Spirit of the
[1:01:56] Lord Jesus Almighty God God build a body
[1:02:02] the word he could come and live in that
[1:02:04] body all right that would make his whole
[1:02:07] being then too we were that we were
[1:02:12] trying to bring out the other day what
[1:02:14] Nana the Lord Jesus his body was not
[1:02:18] eternal it had to be made eternal in the
[1:02:23] resurrection you know in the change and
[1:02:25] the thing and going forward all right so
[1:02:28] that made him body spirit and soul a
[1:02:32] triune being to where everything is in
[1:02:37] the right place okay come on now that
[1:02:42] his body was not eternal because it was
[1:02:45] created it had a beginning so it had to
[1:02:50] be made eternal so he done that and is
[1:02:53] like Wade was preaching back months and
[1:02:56] months ago that he inherited eternal
[1:02:59] life see by following the word and
[1:03:04] letting all of that growing in him
[1:03:07] because the Bible speaks of said he grew
[1:03:09] in grace and knowledge huh and it came
[1:03:13] to a place till he brought that body
[1:03:16] totally under subjection all right all
[1:03:22] he had to do is move a finger and when I
[1:03:24] entered the whole thing at Calvary but
[1:03:27] he didn't he brought it all under
[1:03:29] subjection he yielded himself so much
[1:03:31] until he just become a complete unit of
[1:03:35] Almighty God when we get to glory it's
[1:03:38] not going to be a halo over here
[1:03:40] a pillar fire over here and there's
[1:03:42] something over here to represent these
[1:03:44] line you're gonna see Jesus and know who
[1:03:46] he is why because he's always been Jesus
[1:03:50] that's always been his name you don't
[1:03:53] thank him for that I walk through the
[1:03:55] house and lord thank you for revealing
[1:03:57] your name to me
[1:03:59] your name is Jesus now that's the name
[1:04:03] of the son
[1:04:06] mmm he said I come in my father tonight
[1:04:11] we don't get into those simplicity's do
[1:04:14] we didn't grow up so far till we don't
[1:04:17] get back into those topics
[1:04:19] the Jesus would say I and my father are
[1:04:22] one he said if you've seen me you've
[1:04:25] seen the father have we forgotten those
[1:04:28] scriptures there was God in a human
[1:04:34] vessel walk through life paid the price
[1:04:38] then and by paying the price for you and
[1:04:41] I to receive now listen we're
[1:04:43] enrollments there the other day where
[1:04:45] were heirs of God is up Paul and Roman
[1:04:49] and joint heirs with Jesus Christ right
[1:04:56] heirs of God is eternal life for our
[1:05:01] soul and our spirit listen eternal life
[1:05:07] for our soul and spirit comes from God
[1:05:12] eternal out in flesh making us co-equal
[1:05:17] with him is because he's going to change
[1:05:20] these bodies and make these bodies just
[1:05:25] as eternal as the soul and spirit will
[1:05:30] be towards our trouble at our trouble is
[1:05:35] in that spirit realm right it's in that
[1:05:39] spirit realm because within the soul of
[1:05:43] a born-again believer God is sealed in
[1:05:46] and Satan is sealed out and as a baby
[1:05:51] what it has to do is eat and it grows a
[1:05:56] Christian all you got to do is eat the
[1:05:58] Word of God and you'll grow right
[1:06:04] because that's part of the doing why
[1:06:07] because he's adding the word then
[1:06:09] listening how much do I try to teach you
[1:06:10] how much we've been over and over this
[1:06:13] messenger of Malachi 4:2 to 17:30 gonna
[1:06:16] do two things 1 turn the hearts of the
[1:06:17] face back revived and
[1:06:19] the thunders which is revelation
[1:06:20] containing the seven seals many times
[1:06:22] we've been over there it takes the
[1:06:24] opening of the word to bring the bride
[1:06:27] of Jesus Christ to a place that we can
[1:06:30] even talk about a change we're going to
[1:06:34] have to have control of that second room
[1:06:38] the spirit room before you come to the
[1:06:43] center I mean come to the change of the
[1:06:45] outside man right and see the nurse were
[1:06:50] that the stature of a perfect man comes
[1:06:52] in there of his divine nature coming
[1:06:57] into each one of us and what have I
[1:07:00] always talked he he adds the word this
[1:07:03] is all I've ever told you take the word
[1:07:06] you study the word you believe it you
[1:07:11] listen the tapes you do as much as you
[1:07:12] can and you're believing it all right
[1:07:15] and you're taking that word in
[1:07:21] come on a lot of times you read and
[1:07:23] don't even get a thing right how many
[1:07:24] times you said that that I read read
[1:07:26] read didn't get nothing and then all at
[1:07:28] once you pick up that same scripture
[1:07:30] same book or whatever you read it in
[1:07:32] other ways this opens everything up well
[1:07:35] how did that happen because he doesn't
[1:07:37] put the seed in the field you've been
[1:07:40] doing what was right see if we let him
[1:07:43] come in to us to give us a new birth
[1:07:47] then by that part of us inside now these
[1:07:54] this is the virtues the virtuous is not
[1:07:56] in the body that's a display right
[1:08:00] that's a display what your body is is a
[1:08:03] display of what's within you which is
[1:08:06] where they're deceiving is that the body
[1:08:07] can display one looks whereas the real
[1:08:11] looks is on the other side that's where
[1:08:13] the problem with the body you can't
[1:08:14] trust that thing it's got to be changed
[1:08:19] right you just can't trust it it's gonna
[1:08:23] give us trouble all over life now I'm
[1:08:26] now quote brother branham did he say you
[1:08:29] will be a sticker until the change comes
[1:08:34] well I can't have it he said there's
[1:08:37] another one of them you know I can't
[1:08:40] help it he didn't say that
[1:08:43] he didn't say you can't help it he said
[1:08:47] we'd be a sticker that's just God's
[1:08:48] honest truth we're human beings and long
[1:08:52] as we're in this world and in his life
[1:08:54] we're gonna have trouble with this old
[1:08:56] guy out here so quit trying to get him
[1:08:59] born again
[1:09:02] right let's watch the new birth of the
[1:09:05] denomination there what go to church
[1:09:07] then go to church getting through this
[1:09:09] getting past I'm gonna do that you do
[1:09:11] that go to the real close
[1:09:12] Oh open it wonderful we are all good
[1:09:14] Christians dealing with the outside man
[1:09:20] right but listen how does this thing
[1:09:27] work upon us this Christian there's a
[1:09:32] whole unit God brings the word in as
[1:09:39] we've got to read it right come on come
[1:09:42] on are you with me we've got to read it
[1:09:43] we've got to study it you don't just
[1:09:45] open this up well you need a little
[1:09:47] cleaning no no no no that's where our
[1:09:50] trouble is our trouble is we don't study
[1:09:55] the word well I read a book three months
[1:10:02] ago well that's real good I read John
[1:10:07] 3:16 I think he's still in the Bible you
[1:10:13] know okay sure
[1:10:18] listen
[1:10:21] God brings the word to us the Holy Ghost
[1:10:25] brother branham said now are you
[1:10:27] listening he said the Holy Ghost is in
[1:10:30] your soul your inner being whatever you
[1:10:34] want to call it spirit or soul or though
[1:10:36] you know the doctor or whatever the
[1:10:38] inner being of mankind the Holy Spirit
[1:10:42] comes within that inner being all right
[1:10:46] and brings within that now listen with
[1:10:50] that Holy Spirit have any other nature
[1:10:52] than the nature of God
[1:10:54] okay now you listening give me a few
[1:10:58] minutes so then that new birth brings
[1:11:03] within you and that's what Paul and
[1:11:06] Peter then we'll say the divine nature
[1:11:08] of Almighty coffee brother branham say
[1:11:12] it he said he had that and listen talk
[1:11:17] about not him Jesus Christ and he said
[1:11:19] they had a pice for that to go out you
[1:11:21] remember that he's in stature perfect
[1:11:24] man said he had within him and the
[1:11:27] disciples had within them the nature of
[1:11:30] God in their soul and a pice a way for
[1:11:35] that to go out because that's the life
[1:11:38] you live he said that's where the
[1:11:42] trouble is he said we come here and do
[1:11:45] things all wrong and everything at all
[1:11:47] during the week and then we come to
[1:11:48] church he said people sees that but now
[1:11:54] listen he brings the word we accept the
[1:11:59] word and say thank you lord
[1:12:00] he quickens it to us but I said the Holy
[1:12:03] Ghost in waiting on you to bring him the
[1:12:04] word well he is the word what do you
[1:12:07] mean why don't we know numb right now
[1:12:08] where the X word yeah well that's good
[1:12:11] on it so just close your Bible up throw
[1:12:14] it away
[1:12:15] he wants me know anything I've had this
[1:12:19] toad my face you try to tell people the
[1:12:21] truth and they'll say brother branham's
[1:12:25] head if God wants you to know he thanks
[1:12:29] and he you put somebody on the pulpit I
[1:12:34] had that toad in my face so many times
[1:12:37] until finally I answered a person I said
[1:12:40] yeah but if you're in the wrong building
[1:12:45] okay I got it all I hate that for a long
[1:12:49] time I said if you're in the wrong
[1:12:52] building
[1:12:53] then we're yeah I can't feed you in the
[1:12:58] wrong building
[1:12:59] so you're demanded to go for the words
[1:13:02] out I didn't say he wants you to
[1:13:05] he either demands it or either you don't
[1:13:08] do it you go with a word is that to stay
[1:13:12] with that word until it can manifest
[1:13:13] itself right why because he inside of
[1:13:18] you the Holy Ghost he has all these
[1:13:21] natures the Holy Ghost in you has all
[1:13:24] these natures right I mean you know
[1:13:26] we're said nature I mean virtue
[1:13:28] sometimes all right he has all of that
[1:13:31] but how is he going to get it back out
[1:13:39] he reveals the word you take the word
[1:13:44] and as you take the word then back out
[1:13:48] through your spirit now here's where
[1:13:52] we're gonna get it for a minute back out
[1:13:54] through your spirit he manifests these
[1:13:56] virtues back out through your spirit
[1:14:02] from that inward being now so it's not
[1:14:05] now the new birth of the body no it's
[1:14:08] not the new birth of the Spirit no hmm
[1:14:12] neither one of them won't work it's the
[1:14:14] new birth of the soul
[1:14:15] all right then that comes back outwardly
[1:14:19] that we're that natural body out here
[1:14:22] that's worth nothing the body's dead it
[1:14:25] worth nothing but through that God can
[1:14:28] bring
[1:14:29] his nature his ways back out through
[1:14:32] your spirit he'll use your spirit to
[1:14:35] make those manifest but it's not to just
[1:14:40] say well the spirit rent no it's the
[1:14:42] whole being sitting there thinking
[1:14:46] another day and the Lord just said the
[1:14:48] whole being the whole being is what we
[1:14:53] want to have in manifestation before God
[1:14:57] so if God brings us the word then how
[1:15:03] did that come into the spirit realm
[1:15:05] God's Word the body will automatically
[1:15:09] obey now listen I thought you believed
[1:15:15] in the body's dead no my body's not
[1:15:20] gonna automatically obey come on if your
[1:15:24] soul is right and it works back out
[1:15:29] through your spirit what's the body
[1:15:32] gonna do well I body to do what it wants
[1:15:35] to
[1:15:37] we ain't dumb the body does what the
[1:15:42] spirit says do right the body does what
[1:15:49] the spirit says do the spirit does what
[1:15:51] the soul says do so the whole being is a
[1:15:55] Christian
[1:15:58] these virtues will be made manifest out
[1:16:01] through your spirit after they're sealed
[1:16:05] in in God after they're sealed in God
[1:16:15] seals that word into you from the inside
[1:16:18] out
[1:16:20] let's don't worry about the body it'll
[1:16:24] take care of itself it's only gonna do
[1:16:27] what our soul says through our spirit to
[1:16:31] manifest through our body your body
[1:16:34] can't do it it would be some kind of a
[1:16:36] freak thing you said well I move I move
[1:16:38] yeah that's the way you'd be as a as
[1:16:40] you'd be calling yourself a Christian
[1:16:42] your your body keeps on but you know
[1:16:45] that something causes that old kicker to
[1:16:47] kill thicken right because if it it
[1:16:51] ain't it ain't something inside of our
[1:16:52] book that we need to be there's a spirit
[1:16:57] of that human being of course in the
[1:16:59] dogs is in everything else it's making
[1:17:02] that life work are you following me see
[1:17:07] then the the virtues will be made
[1:17:10] manifest through your spirit from the
[1:17:15] inner man which is the soul and listen
[1:17:21] folks a man back there that had his
[1:17:24] buddy killed that all kind of things
[1:17:28] went wrong adult reason never worked but
[1:17:32] yet he says my soul thirst after the old
[1:17:36] Lord
[1:17:39] that wouldn't in his body there wasn't
[1:17:42] any spirit it was any soul he was a
[1:17:48] human being
[1:17:49] you'd have one thing right if you'd
[1:17:52] listened I've tried to explain it for 40
[1:17:54] years your soul is a moral obligation to
[1:17:58] do right now you explain it any other
[1:18:01] way you want to but your soul is really
[1:18:04] a moral obligation to do right
[1:18:07] why because you were created of God see
[1:18:13] we want these things manifest let them
[1:18:19] be manifest out through us but let it be
[1:18:21] because the word has done it to you not
[1:18:24] because you just decided to do it you
[1:18:27] decide to do it you're gonna mess up the
[1:18:29] next day come on but let God come from
[1:18:34] the inside and let him work on the whole
[1:18:37] big that's a whole being body spirit and
[1:18:45] soul Paul said to stand blameless before
[1:18:48] God how can that happen through the
[1:18:53] Christian life of Christ coming into the
[1:18:56] soul and then letting the soul work back
[1:18:58] out through your spirit realm into your
[1:19:02] body and it'll manifest it what brother
[1:19:07] Dale I have so many problems with my
[1:19:09] body obeying these other things that's
[1:19:11] right because it's in the spirit realm
[1:19:12] that's where you're dealing with that
[1:19:14] guy from he don't work by yourself your
[1:19:17] body don't work by yourself you said
[1:19:18] well Lord forgive me now forgive me
[1:19:22] that's old bodies acting wrong Lord it's
[1:19:27] closer than that
[1:19:28] so body ain't acting wrong body just
[1:19:31] does what something else with my vote
[1:19:33] motivates it controls it which is the
[1:19:37] spirit realm all right that's where I've
[1:19:40] always tried to explain it to you what a
[1:19:43] Christian can sin
[1:19:48] is what the Bible says and what the
[1:19:50] prophecy of Christian can sin but it's
[1:19:57] only through his spirit that he can see
[1:20:00] us
[1:20:01] he came sin with his body because it
[1:20:04] doesn't work unless his spirit works and
[1:20:05] he's not going to sin through the soul
[1:20:09] because that's sealed all right now as
[1:20:13] each one of these we'll get to this as
[1:20:15] each one of these come forth into human
[1:20:17] body I mean the human person the whole
[1:20:20] being is sealed in that's why I said to
[1:20:24] you don't they no need a word about
[1:20:25] trying to get brotherly kindness when
[1:20:27] you down to bottom that's all right but
[1:20:30] you ain't gonna do it until it's sealed
[1:20:31] in you got to let each thing be sealed
[1:20:34] in and then we'll come to brotherly
[1:20:36] kindness brother I said it was no hard
[1:20:38] problem for brotherly kindness it's in
[1:20:41] the book he said but now to hold keep it
[1:20:44] as a whole to keep it as a whole there's
[1:20:50] a hard problem but you understand what
[1:20:53] I'm getting at see through that part
[1:21:01] that's inside of you God keeps bringing
[1:21:05] that word through and it comes through
[1:21:08] now listen what's how it come just think
[1:21:10] the whole being or you know it's got to
[1:21:13] come through the body it's got to come
[1:21:19] through here so it's wonderful what
[1:21:25] about that man being able to be brought
[1:21:27] under control from the outside going in
[1:21:31] and then let that inside come back out
[1:21:35] so then really the world I'm going to
[1:21:38] interstate them really then the world is
[1:21:41] looking more at your spirit being
[1:21:43] displayed than it is anything else
[1:21:48] because your body's not displaying the
[1:21:50] body just working from what it did these
[1:21:55] artists were your memory your reason
[1:21:57] your conscience things come in at
[1:22:01] there's were II failed in her memory
[1:22:07] now she couldn't remember something
[1:22:09] being wrong by car cause it wasn't
[1:22:10] nothing wrong back I repeat come on
[1:22:12] listen and get it straight her memory
[1:22:15] her reason her conscious as I begin to
[1:22:18] reason on these time she had eternal
[1:22:24] life in her soul blasphemous names you
[1:22:29] go do what you want to what's your
[1:22:31] profit covers bless me miss tonight that
[1:22:33] Adam had eternal life well if Adam had
[1:22:35] eternal life that Eve had eternal life
[1:22:37] because it was in the same theophany now
[1:22:39] I'm quoting brother Branham okay and see
[1:22:43] then that comes under the be that there
[1:22:45] she was in her spirit room don't you
[1:22:50] think you can never conquer this spirit
[1:22:53] it's the easier to conquer the body than
[1:22:56] it is to conquer this spirit the only
[1:22:59] way you're ever gonna conquer the spirit
[1:23:00] that's within you is from the inside out
[1:23:05] you can fast that order go to show you
[1:23:09] where the prophet see it he said I've
[1:23:11] never and I know I used to people didn't
[1:23:13] like it but I I can't help it I found
[1:23:15] where the Prophet said he said I ain't
[1:23:16] never fasted over three days and my life
[1:23:18] misty everybody's oh brother run faster
[1:23:20] brother in fact he said ain't never
[1:23:22] faster over three days I'm alive now but
[1:23:23] he said he fasted constantly because a
[1:23:27] lot of times he didn't need but one meal
[1:23:29] a day that was fast for meetings he was
[1:23:33] having in time he would do and not eat
[1:23:36] you've heard him telling and how amazing
[1:23:40] it would be we've listened one the other
[1:23:42] day where he was talking about and he
[1:23:43] said said I went over to get something
[1:23:45] to eat
[1:23:45] he said cause I wouldn't go to do what
[1:23:48] would he wasn't gonna do the healing
[1:23:50] line that night or something he said so
[1:23:52] I could eat because gonna preach you
[1:23:57] know but he knew the difference and the
[1:24:00] way things work within him and he'd say
[1:24:05] I fasted today a lot of people fast
[1:24:10] brother Carolina
[1:24:13] he told us years ago remember he said I
[1:24:17] eat one meal a day he said I've been
[1:24:19] doing that for many many year did you
[1:24:24] only take one meal a day and I believe
[1:24:26] it I did I believe that he he'd done
[1:24:28] that yeah but see we put this on the
[1:24:33] emphasis of this letter they understood
[1:24:35] to put it on the corner brother instead
[1:24:37] of putting it on the word what do you
[1:24:39] mean he'd never fasted with her I'm not
[1:24:42] saying that you don't need to fast maybe
[1:24:44] we need a forty day one but I'll quote
[1:24:47] right around them they ain't no such
[1:24:48] thing in the Bible all right you know
[1:24:54] some of those people fasted and fasted
[1:24:57] we're rid of what they doing I'm not
[1:24:59] there with no stones a lot of them just
[1:25:01] got bigger pants you know instead of
[1:25:05] losing weight they've got bigger pants
[1:25:08] that can look like you're fasting right
[1:25:11] because if you fasten your each book let
[1:25:13] nobody know it other than your wife you
[1:25:16] know right then you go up and you say
[1:25:20] well no I can't eat today I'm fasting

[1:25:28] never bite in the building I used to get

[1:25:31] days and you went in a
[1:25:32] a fake and you'd go in and you know you
