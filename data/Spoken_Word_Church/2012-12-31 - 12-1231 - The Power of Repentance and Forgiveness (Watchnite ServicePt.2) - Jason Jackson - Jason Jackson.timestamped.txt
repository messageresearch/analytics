[12:22] gill about it here they know you do one
[12:25] right here
[12:31] thank you
[12:33] and um that experience that i had
[12:37] um
[12:40] what was
[12:42] the
[12:42] mystery about it or
[12:44] if that's the right word to use
[12:47] i had so much stuff on my mind to say
[12:50] and
[12:52] sometimes brothers say have a hard time
[12:54] understanding me you know
[12:56] sometimes with the accent
[12:58] and
[12:59] i'm saying to myself how am i gonna
[13:01] explain all this so how am i gonna get
[13:03] it out
[13:04] but that's what i was really thinking
[13:06] too how was am i going to get it out
[13:09] and the music and everything playing and
[13:12] when he said
[13:14] you have
[13:16] what you asked for
[13:18] right the first when he said it the
[13:20] first time
[13:22] a doubt came through my mind
[13:26] and he looked me in the eye and he said
[13:28] it again
[13:30] and i guess that is when it really hit
[13:33] home
[13:35] and
[13:36] since after that
[13:38] i just want to say that
[13:40] i feel different
[13:42] hello i believe i am a different person
[13:44] right
[13:46] and i believe that i'm ready
[13:57] thank you
[14:15] he's got something to say
[14:17] he won't do either one of them
[14:22] and both of them might be fine
[14:25] i almost married something
[14:28] thank you
[14:38] my dad used to say better late than
[14:40] night yeah but half time i've always run
[14:42] late amen well though
[14:45] i'm glad we're here tonight amen
[14:47] we wouldn't miss it for nothing i
[14:48] certainly enjoyed that enjoyed that amen
[14:51] the minister there brother jason amen
[14:52] that's the truth all right
[14:55] over the years how many yo
[14:57] i've not gotten near as many years in as
[15:00] brother sam you do there but over the
[15:03] years i have seen over and over just a
[15:05] root of bitterness get in somebody's
[15:07] life right you know
[15:09] and and good folks sure just good folks
[15:13] don't mean no no harm to anybody right
[15:16] we give you the shirt off their backs
[15:18] right we've all been there considering
[15:20] about ourselves so many times you know
[15:21] right
[15:22] but then just some some little something
[15:24] get down on the other side
[15:26] and they don't the people don't
[15:28] necessarily have to even say it it's
[15:29] just something you
[15:30] you you perceive something you say well
[15:33] they don't like me or they did this or
[15:35] that or whatever and
[15:36] you know it it struck me one time and
[15:39] i'm not going to preach but i don't know
[15:40] all right
[15:41] but
[15:42] you're going to give me an hour and a
[15:43] half
[15:46] i'd like to see you go out
[15:49] ain't nothing worse than getting a
[15:50] reputation
[15:54] but you know it struck me one time about
[15:57] who's telling the truth
[15:59] and
[16:00] you know we could say well i saw i saw
[16:02] brother dale i saw brother wade do such
[16:05] and such a thing and you know what with
[16:06] these natural eyes we might have seen it
[16:08] right we could have actually saw it
[16:10] right right but what these natural eyes
[16:12] didn't see between the time we saw him
[16:14] do that the time we started to speak
[16:16] that to somebody or do something might
[16:18] have just been brother wade getting down
[16:20] on his knees right right and said oh god
[16:23] right exactly i shouldn't have done that
[16:25] or i shouldn't have said that and then
[16:27] we go forth and we said well i know my
[16:29] brother i know he did this and that i
[16:31] want to ask you something who's the liar
[16:33] then right right brother wade and he
[16:35] says listen you know i did it's under
[16:37] the blood right the brother would sit
[16:39] there and say well they did this and no
[16:41] no because you're seeing this in the
[16:42] eyes of god right he never did it to
[16:45] begin with right right right when
[16:46] brother brennan begins teaching and
[16:48] preaching on justification he's not
[16:49] saying here that you know it's not just
[16:52] as though they didn't do it he said they
[16:54] didn't do it again
[16:56] they never did that right right you know
[16:58] we ought to be the most freest
[17:01] place in europe that's right because we
[17:03] can raise our hands and say oh
[17:05] amen i am the redeemed amen i'm the
[17:08] redeemer but you know when you're saying
[17:09] i am the redeemed you're saying that god
[17:11] has taken you from some place
[17:13] someplace it was out there and he put
[17:15] you back where you were at to begin with
[17:18] who were you at to begin with he said he
[17:20] created them in his own image and
[17:22] perfect he created that very image of
[17:24] god amen
[17:25] amen when he spoke he spoke a perfect
[17:28] right individual right he spoke a
[17:31] perfect life right he spoke a life that
[17:34] that has no doubts it has no pain that
[17:37] has no hurt
[17:39] brother i really believe when you were
[17:40] sitting there and you're you're
[17:42] struggling trying to say well lord i
[17:43] believe and i'm going to do that anyways
[17:46] brother branham said when you recognize
[17:49] that the word of god is evil right
[17:52] you've heard from your theopoly right
[17:53] yeah and at a time when we're sitting
[17:55] there and that that word of god might
[17:57] have been by his stripes i'm healed
[17:59] right it might have been you know to
[18:00] speak the word speak to this mountain it
[18:02] shall be moved but you know when you
[18:03] begin to feed on that word you're
[18:05] hearing from that body that he created
[18:07] before the foundational world you're
[18:09] hearing from that word of god right amen
[18:12] and brother branham said that body is is
[18:14] what i forget what year he said this is
[18:16] it but it's just not even 20 feet away
[18:18] right right right you know i'll just say
[18:20] this is my personal belief here belief
[18:21] here tonight but i believe we're closer
[18:23] than 23.
[18:25] 2012 was a rough year i'll just be
[18:27] honest with you buddy i don't know how
[18:28] we made it through in a lot of ways it's
[18:30] been it's been rough and
[18:32] and i don't look for it to be any better
[18:34] naturally physically speaking in 2013.
[18:36] it'll probably be even a lot harder
[18:38] right right but you know what i'm going
[18:39] to be closer to my 2013 that wasn't
[18:42] 2012. i'm gonna be closer to my theory
[18:45] in 2013 than i was in 2012. why because
[18:48] i'm going to keep feeding on this eagle
[18:50] friday right
[18:51] that's it we got a lot to be happy all
[18:54] right
[19:00] this past year
[19:02] i told the church at home i said my you
[19:04] know we look at the different things
[19:05] well i've got this problem and i've got
[19:07] that problem oh my you
[19:15] you ain't got no problems
[19:17] now that's a hateful thing for a
[19:19] preacher
[19:21] that's a hateful thing for somebody that
[19:23] has helped me preach everybody knows
[19:24] preachers think of the problems right
[19:26] now
[19:27] but that's a hateful thing for somebody
[19:29] that's got the easy life you know to say
[19:31] to somebody that's out there working and
[19:33] struggling and having this and that and
[19:34] everything else but since you ain't got
[19:36] a problem in the world right right right
[19:39] you've got opportunities right gloria
[19:41] all right amen it's an opportunity for
[19:43] god to show himself great in your life
[19:45] amen right right
[19:47] absolutely i thank god for all the
[19:49] opportunities
[19:50] amen
[19:52] god will make this child a blessing amen
[19:54] amen lord amen
[19:57] amen god bless you sir amen
[20:10] getting ready i'll just say this you
[20:12] know what brother dutch was talking
[20:13] about steve wade was over praying in
[20:15] there you are doing talking about how
[20:17] bad he is he's asking god to forgive
[20:20] you know being pastor puts you in a
[20:22] position
[20:23] i remember brother here one time he said
[20:26] anybody that ever says anything says
[20:28] i'll bring the stone and let's see you
[20:29] know the first one
[20:31] i said
[20:32] brother if you bring the throne the
[20:34] stone i have to throw it
[20:37] that's because i'm pastor right
[20:40] that's serious
[20:42] i said i gotta throw this down
[20:44] whether i want to or not i got to throw
[20:46] it
[20:47] because i'm the pastor
[20:49] but you see i used to worry about that
[20:51] being pastor where the bible says turn
[20:53] 61 over to satan for destruction of the
[20:55] flesh
[21:00] that used to bother me because it's
[21:02] pasture
[21:03] maybe sometime i have to do it
[21:06] i searched diligently to find the answer
[21:09] i found one day worth it
[21:12] you can't turn somebody over to the
[21:14] devil
[21:15] i know you're thinking the bible says it
[21:19] he said the bible says turn since you
[21:20] went over to the devil
[21:22] you're not reading
[21:24] you're reading what you want to read
[21:27] i found where the prophet said it this
[21:29] way
[21:30] he said you turned that person over to
[21:32] god amen
[21:34] he said then they turn them over to the
[21:35] devil
[21:37] god does you know
[21:39] see because i can't turn him over to the
[21:40] devil because like i said what if it was
[21:43] waiting i'm turning over to the devil
[21:44] he's over there praying
[21:47] and he's asking god to forgive him and
[21:48] i'm over here trying to kill him
[21:53] you see the bible says
[21:56] exactly right the prophet gave us
[21:57] understanding
[21:59] see then that way you just bring them
[22:00] you've got to go through stages you've
[22:02] got 30 days examples to go and somebody
[22:05] to witness what you're doing and then
[22:06] you bring them before the church
[22:09] and then you lose them for god to do
[22:11] what he wants to do
[22:12] he said he'll put a devil life for him
[22:16] he'll bring him to the right
[22:19] and it ain't you having to do it right
[22:21] you see him doing his work
[22:23] that's right
[22:44] oh
[22:56] hey
[23:20] uh
[23:48] please
[24:09] hello
[24:30] it
[25:12] hallelujah what's that turtle

[28:04] with michael he used to be a real
[28:06] handful but i was talking to him
[28:11] a lot of people have been praying all
[28:13] through the years and even one year we
[28:15] were not there i could feel the prayers

[48:52] 40 something years after the prophet
[48:54] left the scene
[48:56] right

[49:00] almost 40 years in egypt because of
[49:02] rejecting moses
[49:06] when god's phone right
[49:08] people's phone
[49:10] but you know when they got to crying out
[49:12] and wanted to be delivered
[49:13] they were delivered
[49:15] right
[49:17] but around said each age falls and goes
[49:19] to the ground
[49:21] he said if people start crying out for
[49:22] deliverance he said god opens up another
[49:25] age and brings another
[49:27] message another time

[50:04] the faith is a simple thing
[50:07] that's believing in god
[50:10] accepting what he said
[50:13] and then just thank him for it
[50:16] then go say it thank god for my healing

[50:38] hill
[50:39] he said by his drops i can see about
[50:41] that time his eyes came open

[50:48] they're going what time it is
[50:54] it's for us to believe in god amen
[51:19] yes
[51:38] trees
[51:52] so
[52:25] till we

[54:21] and i say
[54:26] we have been here
[54:43] me

[55:23] forever
[55:39] me
[55:58] oh
[56:26] word of the lord
[56:37] it's been five years since we've been
[56:38] back now
[56:41] i'm so thankful too that uh
[56:46] a lot of you don't know but i was in
[56:49] pretty bad shape i mean health-wise
[56:53] i hadn't walked with a cane
[56:57] i was told when uh
[57:00] when i left the church that i'd be dead
[57:03] in six months
[57:07] it's been over five years
[57:21] thank you
[57:34] brother richard sitting in a wheelchair
[57:36] down in front of a church one time
[57:39] i wouldn't give him two weeks to live
[57:40] that's right
[57:44] i was really afraid to pray for him
[57:45] because
[57:47] it was kind of a touchy situation
[57:51] i made my way around
[57:53] finally just got over to him just laid
[57:55] my hands there
[57:57] that's the lord touching me
[58:02] i believe god
[58:21] singing a song one time in service he
[58:23] said he loved this song
[58:24] it's when we all get to get heaven
[58:27] i didn't want to take a quick moment
[58:29] and and give a little bit of a testimony
[58:32] that
[58:33] about my life
[58:35] and the things that i had done
[58:38] uh you know i used to teach understand
[58:40] years ago here
[58:41] and turned my back on god
[58:43] and walked away
[58:45] and did what i wanted to do
[58:48] instead of what he wanted me to do
[58:50] unfortunately i paint dearly both
[58:52] physically emotionally psychologically
[58:54] and financially
[58:57] okay in every aspect i've been hit
[58:59] uh
[59:00] you know it's uh
[59:02] it's been kind of tough because i've
[59:03] lived every kind of wrong that you could
[59:05] ever think of
[59:06] i've tried to drown my problems in
[59:08] alcohol
[59:10] smoking tobacco all kinds of stuff
[59:12] okay but
[59:14] i never found the answer that's right
[59:16] and uh it took going to war
[59:20] seeing some horrible things
[59:22] and coming back and realizing
[59:25] exactly what i had right right in front
[59:27] of me the whole time
[59:29] and
[59:31] god took he made a difference in my life
[59:34] he's
[59:35] he he caught me at my weakest moment
[59:38] and
[59:39] smashed a hold of me
[59:41] and showed me just how weak i really was
[59:44] no matter how physically strong
[59:46] i've been most of my life my physical
[59:49] strength meant nothing
[59:50] that's right and
[59:53] my sons
[59:54] they love singing with me
[59:56] and for a long time
[59:58] while i was doing my thing
[1:00:01] i couldn't sing a gospel song all the
[1:00:03] way through my boy stopped
[1:00:05] i couldn't see and everybody knows that
[1:00:07] i love to sing
[1:00:09] and i asked god that
[1:00:12] if
[1:00:14] whenever he brought me back not if but
[1:00:16] when he brought me back
[1:00:18] that i could have my voice back
[1:00:21] that i could sing amen
[1:00:24] and i would sing for the rest of my
[1:00:26] days and give him give honor to him
[1:00:29] through sin yes sir
[1:00:31] and
[1:00:32] now my little boy here wants to sing the
[1:00:34] song with me
[1:00:36] and we actually whenever he heard it he
[1:00:37] wanted me to download the song on my
[1:00:39] phone the only one i could find was alan
[1:00:41] jackson
[1:00:43] okay
[1:00:44] you know what i mean
[1:00:46] i still got the song on my phone
[1:00:48] and we're sitting there singing it at
[1:00:50] the house he said daddy said i think i
[1:00:51] like i like the way we sing it better in
[1:00:53] church
[1:00:56] i said well okay that's that's fine
[1:00:59] you know what that that's great all
[1:01:01] right so we're gonna give it a shot
[1:01:03] all right and i always tell sister
[1:01:06] esther that i'm terrible with keeping
[1:01:08] with music so hopefully he'll be able to
[1:01:10] do a better job than i would
[1:01:15] i have no idea
[1:01:17] you'll move a little bit where he's
[1:01:19] gonna get you better let's move over
[1:01:20] this way a little bit and he'll be able
[1:01:21] to hear us too
[1:01:24] all right
[1:01:27] where you want to start you'll start the
[1:01:28] at the course or the very very top
[1:01:31] what song
[1:01:32] it's uh when we all get to heaven
[1:01:35] page 166 in the spiral
[1:01:38] and if y'all want to sing with us be my
[1:01:40] guest
[1:01:41] because as everybody up here in the
[1:01:44] group that is going to sing here a
[1:01:46] little while found out i sing better
[1:01:48] with other people
[1:01:58] love of jesus
[1:02:46] the
[1:02:51] is
[1:03:17] me
[1:03:40] when we
[1:04:08] is
[1:04:13] is
[1:04:42] me
[1:05:07] for the corn you sing
[1:05:10] come on take us on the part amen sure
[1:05:12] just to find a little bit of church
[1:05:16] yes
[1:05:18] you need to get them
[1:05:34] okay
[1:05:49] i'd like to say that we always enjoy
[1:05:53] being in church right
[1:05:59] right it is that's pretty much what we
[1:06:01] live for right now
[1:06:05] and more and more as time goes on right
[1:06:08] right
[1:06:10] because the bible does say
[1:06:12] forsake not the assembly amen
[1:06:15] of yourselves together as the manner of
[1:06:18] some is and i know some of them right
[1:06:21] right
[1:06:23] thanks so much for more yes
[1:06:25] as you see the day approaching do you
[1:06:28] see the day that's right all right
[1:06:29] that's
[1:06:30] it that's the fun thing
[1:06:33] if you really see the day approaching if
[1:06:36] you really see it you'll do something
[1:06:38] about it right glory
[1:06:40] if you don't you won't
[1:06:42] right that's very a very simple equation
[1:06:45] right amen
[1:06:47] that's right
[1:06:48] very simple you know the lord has been
[1:06:51] so good to me
[1:06:52] one song says he set my captive spirit
[1:06:56] free right man amen i'm in a brand new
[1:06:58] world since the lord saved me
[1:07:02] right i've been in that new world now
[1:07:04] about 33 years
[1:07:07] fact is the eighth day of this
[1:07:10] month is fixing to come in
[1:07:12] the eighth day of this month will mark
[1:07:15] 33 years that i've been in this brand
[1:07:18] new world amen
[1:07:21] and i'm going to tell you when i step
[1:07:23] out there
[1:07:25] into
[1:07:26] this wonderful creation and i look up in
[1:07:28] that sky and at them trees
[1:07:32] you know from time to time it comes back
[1:07:34] to me all over again that's brand new
[1:07:37] trees right there
[1:07:39] you know that's right that i'm looking
[1:07:41] at
[1:07:42] i believe the bible said something about
[1:07:45] or maybe it's a song that says the trees
[1:07:47] of the field shall clap their hand
[1:07:54] and you know everything that the lord
[1:07:56] made praises him except
[1:07:59] for lost humanity right that's right
[1:08:03] so i thank the lord for delivering me
[1:08:06] from a wicked life of sin 33 years ago
[1:08:09] yes sir
[1:08:12] yes you would have had to know how it
[1:08:14] really was
[1:08:18] and if you hadn't known how it really
[1:08:20] was
[1:08:22] then you you'd have had to have a lot
[1:08:25] of that thing that we've been talking
[1:08:27] about here tonight called platelet right
[1:08:29] exactly
[1:08:31] otherwise you would have poured out your
[1:08:33] little book and you're to mark my name
[1:08:35] out
[1:08:35] right
[1:08:37] forget it right
[1:08:40] you see the thing about me was i was
[1:08:42] raised to know
[1:08:46] what i needed to do
[1:08:51] as i come into my teenage years and the
[1:08:54] lord began to strive
[1:08:56] upon the waters of my soul
[1:09:03] and i walked into that valley that's
[1:09:05] called the valley of decision
[1:09:10] and i made a decision right
[1:09:14] and the decision that i made was a bad
[1:09:18] decision and i walked out into this
[1:09:22] dark world of sin
[1:09:25] and i got so lost out there
[1:09:33] that what it actually come down to with
[1:09:35] me brother dale
[1:09:39] was that
[1:09:40] i decided that
[1:09:44] i would be an atheist
[1:09:50] what can the law do for somebody like
[1:09:52] that
[1:09:53] i'll tell you what he done for a lot of
[1:09:55] them he cut them off yes it is
[1:10:01] that's what he done for a lot of them he
[1:10:03] cut them off
[1:10:06] he didn't cut me off thank you thank you
[1:10:08] glory
[1:10:14] well i had somebody that was ringing the
[1:10:17] prayer bales
[1:10:21] brother they was ringing them regularly
[1:10:28] i know what this brother's talking about
[1:10:31] right here when he talks about being
[1:10:33] delivered unto satan for the destruction
[1:10:35] of the flesh
[1:10:37] that the spirit may be saved in the day
[1:10:40] of the lord jesus
[1:10:42] and i understand what he's talking about
[1:10:45] when he said we don't deliver them unto
[1:10:46] satan we deliver them to god and then
[1:10:49] god does whatever's
[1:10:51] right right in the best interest
[1:10:57] that's right
[1:11:00] sometimes it looks like sometimes as i
[1:11:02] would say it cuts them off but right
[1:11:04] right yeah
[1:11:06] but anyway
[1:11:07] i had somebody that was praying for me
[1:11:11] gloria
[1:11:12] i had an old daddy
[1:11:15] he's been gone nearly two years
[1:11:19] he was praying for me
[1:11:25] and um
[1:11:27] i remember a time as i began to get into
[1:11:30] that dark world of atheism
[1:11:35] and i was running from the call of god
[1:11:37] and ain't no other way to run but in the
[1:11:39] darkness and unbelief
[1:11:41] that's the only way to run that's where
[1:11:43] you're going if you run from god
[1:11:46] you ain't running into the lights you
[1:11:48] running out of the light and away from
[1:11:50] the light
[1:11:51] right
[1:11:52] so i was running and i was running from
[1:11:54] god and i began to run
[1:11:56] into that dark world of atheism because
[1:11:59] i didn't choose to believe that i was
[1:12:01] going to hell
[1:12:02] even though i know that i was unless i
[1:12:05] turned them
[1:12:07] well
[1:12:08] one uh
[1:12:10] day i still lived at home i might have
[1:12:12] been 16 years old
[1:12:14] i was
[1:12:17] uh around the house i can't remember
[1:12:20] exactly what all i was doing i still
[1:12:21] lived at home
[1:12:23] i was around the house
[1:12:25] i can't remember for sure exactly what i
[1:12:28] was thinking about that day but most
[1:12:30] likely that's what i was thinking about
[1:12:33] because that's what i thought about all
[1:12:35] the time
[1:12:37] was how that i don't believe in god and
[1:12:39] i'm going to disprove his existence in
[1:12:42] any way that i can
[1:12:43] mama go to the library and give me some
[1:12:46] books
[1:12:49] about ufo
[1:12:52] i want to know more about that well poor
[1:12:54] mama she
[1:12:56] she done anything little boy wanted her
[1:12:58] to do
[1:12:59] she went to the library and brought back
[1:13:01] a big stack of books about
[1:13:05] because the way i looked at if you could
[1:13:07] prove ufos you could disprove
[1:13:09] god and that's that's
[1:13:11] that seems to be the way that the the
[1:13:14] the big brains of the world
[1:13:18] because they're always looking out
[1:13:20] younder
[1:13:21] gazing at them stars and at them planets
[1:13:24] to see if there's any water
[1:13:26] or if there's any molecules
[1:13:28] right
[1:13:29] or living sails or dead cells that they
[1:13:31] should say they used to be alive
[1:13:35] they're always a looking brother trying
[1:13:37] to find it they're looking diligently
[1:13:39] definitely because evidently they
[1:13:41] believe if they do they've won this
[1:13:43] war against god against the belief right
[1:13:46] in the living god right well that's the
[1:13:49] road i was taking that was the decision
[1:13:51] that i was making
[1:13:53] one day i was around the house
[1:13:57] and i i come into the house
[1:14:00] and i went into my room
[1:14:03] and laid down on the bed
[1:14:05] and as i said i don't remember exactly
[1:14:08] what i was thinking but most likely
[1:14:12] my mind was on
[1:14:15] them atheistic thoughts that i was
[1:14:16] entertaining in my mind all the time
[1:14:18] back in them days
[1:14:20] well i laid down on my bed and i was
[1:14:22] laying there
[1:14:24] and on the other side of the wall
[1:14:27] i could hear my daddy praying
[1:14:30] praise the lord thanks god
[1:14:33] his room was
[1:14:35] right on the other side of the wall from
[1:14:37] my room
[1:14:39] i was laying there and i could hear my
[1:14:41] daddy praying and they wouldn't nothing
[1:14:43] unusual about that
[1:14:46] that was commonplace
[1:14:48] i was used to that right
[1:14:51] with nothing
[1:14:52] uh about it to disturb me i heard it all
[1:14:55] the time well not all the time but i
[1:14:57] heard it on a very regular basis
[1:15:00] i hear my daddy praying
[1:15:02] he spent a lot of his time in his room
[1:15:04] praying
[1:15:06] well i was laying there and i was
[1:15:08] listening to in the back of my mind
[1:15:11] listening to my daddy praying probably
[1:15:13] thinking about
[1:15:14] atheism while i was listening to that
[1:15:17] thing and praying
[1:15:19] and a little bit i could hear my daddy
[1:15:21] speaking in another tongue
[1:15:28] and i laid there and i listened to that
[1:15:32] and the thought that was in my heart
[1:15:37] i can tell you
[1:15:38] at that point what i was thinking
[1:15:41] the thought that was in my heart was
[1:15:44] they wouldn't have to be anything real
[1:15:46] about that
[1:15:49] a person could do that
[1:15:52] within yourself that wouldn't have to be
[1:15:54] a supernatural thing right or a
[1:15:56] supernatural word
[1:16:00] you see i didn't want to believe it was
[1:16:02] real i didn't want to believe it was a
[1:16:04] supernatural
[1:16:13] i was laying there listening to my
[1:16:15] daddy's as it began to speak in other
[1:16:17] tongues and i was laying there in eyes
[1:16:19] disbelieving that's what they call it
[1:16:21] nowadays the bible calls it unbelievable
[1:16:23] i was laying there in unbelief
[1:16:25] listening to that in unbelief doubt
[1:16:27] working in my mind in my heart unbelief
[1:16:31] setting up on the throne of my heart
[1:16:33] even as i was listening to the gift of
[1:16:35] the spirit in operation
[1:16:40] and i laid there
[1:16:42] a little bit
[1:16:45] and all of a sudden
[1:16:49] there was an utterance that came forth
[1:16:51] out of that vessel on the other side of
[1:16:53] the wall
[1:16:55] something like i had never heard in my
[1:16:57] life
[1:16:59] and ain't never heard nothing like that
[1:17:01] since
[1:17:03] never have i heard such an evidence come
[1:17:05] forth
[1:17:06] out of an urban blessing
[1:17:12] shortly i got up and i walked out of my
[1:17:14] room and down deep in my heart i knew
[1:17:17] i had heard something that it wouldn't
[1:17:19] be possible for a person to do right
[1:17:21] within their own actual ability
[1:17:27] what it was is this right here the good
[1:17:29] holy ghost spoke directly to the thought
[1:17:32] of my heart
[1:17:35] he let me know if i had been able to
[1:17:37] acknowledge what he was letting me know
[1:17:40] he let me know that boy i know exactly
[1:17:43] where you are
[1:17:45] i know exactly what you're thinking
[1:17:48] amen
[1:17:51] that ought to have wiped the slate clean
[1:17:55] it ought to have wiped out that whole
[1:17:58] system of unbelief that was setting up
[1:18:00] in my heart
[1:18:01] and in my mind it ought to i've gotten
[1:18:03] rid of it it ought to have eliminated it
[1:18:06] and if i had made a conscious
[1:18:09] acknowledgement right it would have done
[1:18:11] it
[1:18:12] i think this is tying in with what the
[1:18:14] brother preached and out a little bit
[1:18:15] there
[1:18:17] if i hadn't made a conscious
[1:18:18] acknowledgement in my heart and in my
[1:18:21] mind
[1:18:22] that that's god speaking to me
[1:18:34] but you see that acknowledgement didn't
[1:18:36] happen
[1:18:37] i walked out of my room and i dismissed
[1:18:39] that or i didn't just consciously make
[1:18:41] an effort to dismiss it it just drifted
[1:18:44] away
[1:18:45] and i just forgot about it
[1:18:48] many years later
[1:18:49] after i had walked back into the light
[1:18:52] after that i had been delivered unto
[1:18:55] satan
[1:18:56] and found out what it's like to taste of
[1:18:59] the torments of hell just a little bit
[1:19:04] in the
[1:19:05] present existence
[1:19:10] and i walked back into the fullness of
[1:19:12] the glorious light
[1:19:14] of the lord jesus christ
[1:19:16] then i looked back into my past and i
[1:19:20] began to see things that i had forgot
[1:19:22] about
[1:19:23] were that the lord brother
[1:19:25] pointed me out right right from one time
[1:19:28] to another
[1:19:29] down through the line of time that's
[1:19:31] just one experience that i could tell
[1:19:33] you about right
[1:19:37] now what it took for me to get back to
[1:19:39] believing in the lord enough to where i
[1:19:41] could be saved brother dale
[1:19:45] i had to be delivered unto satan
[1:19:49] if you ain't never been down that road
[1:19:51] that's hard for you to get a hold of
[1:19:54] it bites the business says most likely
[1:19:57] you can't get a hold of it
[1:20:00] if you've not been i'm talking about
[1:20:05] ain't no trouble for me to get a hold of
[1:20:07] it because i've been through it
[1:20:10] and then i received a glorious
[1:20:12] experience of salvation yes sir
[1:20:15] amen
[1:20:17] one that the
[1:20:19] that the uh
[1:20:21] accuser has never had the courage to
[1:20:24] challenge
[1:20:25] amen
[1:20:27] that experience that i received on
[1:20:29] january the 8th of 1980
[1:20:33] i laid on my face about four or five
[1:20:36] hours that night
[1:20:37] and i thought i had blasphemed against
[1:20:40] the holy ghost
[1:20:45] i felt like it was over and done with it
[1:20:47] but they just wouldn't nothing else to
[1:20:49] do because i couldn't face
[1:20:53] being lost eternally
[1:21:00] after about four or five hours as i said
[1:21:02] of laying on that old rocking chair
[1:21:04] there in my mom and daddy's living room
[1:21:08] i couldn't say nothing
[1:21:10] but have mercy
[1:21:13] that was the only words that i could
[1:21:14] have glory right right
[1:21:17] right
[1:21:19] and i didn't feel like there was any
[1:21:20] question to me
[1:21:22] i mean i felt like i was
[1:21:27] and i got into a trance and i lost track
[1:21:30] of work where i was at who was around
[1:21:32] what was going on i lost track of all
[1:21:34] that
[1:21:40] and i began to
[1:21:42] raise up and and bow back over and raise
[1:21:45] back up and i didn't realize i was even
[1:21:48] good
[1:21:49] and all of a sudden
[1:21:51] way down in the deepest part of my
[1:21:54] innermost being
[1:21:55] i felt an instantaneous change take
[1:21:58] place amen
[1:22:00] and when i did i realized right then the
[1:22:03] realization come into my mind not an
[1:22:06] imagination right right but the
[1:22:08] realization come into my mind that my
[1:22:11] soul was saved
[1:22:13] and immediately the realization come
[1:22:15] into my mind that my name was being
[1:22:18] written in the book of life right then
[1:22:23] and if you throw the five gallon bucket
[1:22:26] of ice water over me it wouldn't have
[1:22:27] took my breath away
[1:22:29] no more than that experience did right
[1:22:32] now sure
[1:22:38] and when i come up from there as i said
[1:22:41] i had an experience that the
[1:22:43] accuser has never had the courage to
[1:22:46] challenge
[1:22:48] amen
[1:22:50] he's challenged me in many different
[1:22:52] ways
[1:22:56] he's told me a minute be the time boy
[1:22:59] you ain't gonna make it you're going
[1:23:00] down in defeat this time
[1:23:03] and truly i felt like i was it's like
[1:23:06] brother david said we don't want to lift
[1:23:07] up the devil again
[1:23:11] but still we need to acknowledge
[1:23:14] that the devil is much on
[1:23:16] his job
[1:23:18] he is very much concerned about
[1:23:20] accomplishing his goals
[1:23:23] and he's very diligent in the pursuit
[1:23:25] right
[1:23:29] of his objectives right
[1:23:33] we've heard it said
[1:23:34] mean to be the time have we not heard it
[1:23:36] said
[1:23:38] the devil
[1:23:39] don't miss an opportunity right
[1:23:42] well anyway
[1:23:44] we could tell many experiences many
[1:23:46] blessings that the lord has given us but
[1:23:48] we're still i haven't said it all and
[1:23:51] i think we've told you as much of it as
[1:23:53] we could tell you about we're still just
[1:23:55] nothing right i just know that's right
[1:24:00] they just ain't nothing to me right yeah
[1:24:03] the grace of god and paul said by the
[1:24:05] grace of god i am what i am right and i
[1:24:07] hear preachers repeat that from time to
[1:24:09] time you know they think that sounds big
[1:24:11] to say that that way
[1:24:13] by the grace of god i am what i am that
[1:24:15] sounds
[1:24:16] you know they sound like power when they
[1:24:18] say that you know
[1:24:20] i told my son i was sitting in the
[1:24:22] living room talking to my oldest son a
[1:24:24] few months ago or a year ago or so
[1:24:27] i told him i said i don't say that and i
[1:24:29] said there's a reason why i don't say
[1:24:31] that by the grace of god i am what i am
[1:24:34] i said i don't want people looking at me
[1:24:36] and saying is that the best
[1:24:56] right
[1:25:06] i'll tell you what my soul is stirred
[1:25:08] more and more in this day and are we
[1:25:09] living
[1:25:11] i'm looking for any opportunity to let
[1:25:14] go of my savior yes sir
[1:25:19] if i can sing a little song you know
[1:25:21] whatever i can do yes or no i'll try to
[1:25:24] sing and i've not even got the words to
[1:25:26] this but um
[1:25:28] you probably know it i'm not sure what
[1:25:30] you do
[1:25:33] it might be in this
[1:25:38] you looking book oh
[1:25:40] old water savior is probably the name of
[1:25:43] it
[1:25:45] all the saviors probably
[1:25:59] do i will catch at least
[1:26:11] i pretty well know it
[1:26:15] but not whether i've got the right gears
[1:26:18] whatever you want to go in you know
[1:26:24] there you go
[1:26:44] is
[1:26:52] oh
[1:27:16] you
[1:27:21] oh
[1:27:32] oh
[1:27:58] is
[1:28:27] he left
[1:28:53] i'm
[1:29:02] is
[1:29:11] is
[1:29:33] his heart was broken
[1:29:39] oh
[1:30:00] is

[1:31:38] he gave his last
[1:31:44] foreign
[1:32:05] hallelujah
[1:32:22] what a savior
[1:32:36] as it comes when it comes amen all right
[1:32:39] yeah i just uh
[1:32:41] appreciate what god's done in my life
[1:32:46] i can take you
[1:32:47] took place in my front yard when i felt
[1:32:50] the presence of the lord
[1:32:53] but i've strayed from there over the
[1:32:55] years
[1:32:56] but i i know he's real because i was
[1:32:58] right there
[1:32:59] he came in that presence
[1:33:00] you know marked the spot
[1:33:06] and i believe a lot of that because of
[1:33:08] what i've done
[1:33:09] is why i've had the trouble in this
[1:33:11] flesh
[1:33:12] and suffering for sure
[1:33:14] sicknesses i've had
[1:33:16] i believe
[1:33:19] there's a young minister in this message
[1:33:21] that was mentored by our pastor who
[1:33:24] suffered in the flesh
[1:33:26] all right
[1:33:27] and i'm telling you that
[1:33:29] we have to ask for forgiveness
[1:33:31] my brother danny i was supposed to be
[1:33:34] there that morning i was supposed to be
[1:33:36] with him
[1:33:37] when he fell off that chicken house
[1:33:40] for something happened and i wasn't
[1:33:41] there
[1:33:42] i don't know what i cannot remember but
[1:33:45] it was he and i were going there with
[1:33:47] jacob
[1:33:48] and we were going to take meal off this
[1:33:50] chicken
[1:33:52] and i asked for your forgiveness bro
[1:33:56] but that's always troubled me
[1:33:58] in my heart right
[1:34:00] this time i have here
[1:34:02] jacob fountain
[1:34:05] many years ago
[1:34:07] always pray for the brother yes sir the
[1:34:09] young people you don't see here amen
[1:34:12] you know sometimes i have to stop and
[1:34:14] ask myself
[1:34:15] maybe they see something maybe i'm out
[1:34:18] of character when i'm not in the
[1:34:20] presence of the bride
[1:34:22] maybe they saw me do something
[1:34:24] and then
[1:34:25] maybe i did something wrong they said
[1:34:27] that's not real
[1:34:29] but the brother that was just up here
[1:34:30] man i thought coke was a real thing but
[1:34:32] i believe that brother
[1:34:34] he's got the real thing
[1:34:36] and he's trouble and he suffered for it
[1:34:38] as we all will
[1:34:40] but i just ask for your forgiveness
[1:34:46] i believe
[1:34:48] in hebrews 11 5 is my favorite scripture
[1:34:51] in the bible by enoch
[1:34:53] and this is it it's a
[1:34:55] testimony so please god
[1:34:58] you need to stop and ask yourself what
[1:34:59] is your testimony
[1:35:01] and when brother dick asked about a
[1:35:03] testimony the other night it troubled me
[1:35:04] that
[1:35:06] i didn't take the opportunity to share
[1:35:07] what god has done in my life
[1:35:10] you know i've never been without a job
[1:35:12] more than a weekend
[1:35:15] we pray for me and for a job here right
[1:35:19] i was staying at work one day and i was
[1:35:20] praying i said lord if it be your will i
[1:35:22] change jobs
[1:35:24] give me a sign
[1:35:26] i put my resume on monster.com years ago
[1:35:29] and after i made that prayer 30 minutes
[1:35:32] out of the blue a head hunter called me
[1:35:35] and asked me
[1:35:36] do i have an opportunity would you be
[1:35:38] interested in a job
[1:35:40] and i hadn't spoke to anybody in five
[1:35:42] years but i prayed in 30 minutes of lord
[1:35:45] sure amen amen
[1:35:50] i go to this company
[1:35:53] that hadn't had a profit in five years
[1:35:55] they give you 52
[1:35:58] of your monthly earnings and bonuses if
[1:36:00] they make the numbers
[1:36:02] they have made a profit in five years
[1:36:05] i've been with them four and a half four
[1:36:07] years now
[1:36:08] and from january one
[1:36:10] three months after i started they paid a
[1:36:12] profit
[1:36:13] bonus every month
[1:36:16] 52 37 that's an extra check two checks a
[1:36:20] month and lisa if you're not getting
[1:36:22] tithes on that see tan
[1:36:24] but i'm telling you
[1:36:27] it's worth it
[1:36:33] but it's it's almighty god
[1:36:36] and i don't see how anybody can walk
[1:36:38] around in this world
[1:36:40] that doesn't believe in god right
[1:36:42] sterling going through what he did right
[1:36:45] the fear that he must have had in his
[1:36:47] heart
[1:36:48] as a young person

[1:39:34] believe that if it's god's will right
[1:39:37] i'll lay this bible on him and i will
[1:39:38] pray and he can be risen up if it's
[1:39:41] god's will
[1:39:44] but you know he doesn't have the faith i
[1:39:45] had
[1:39:47] my father didn't have the faith i had
[1:39:48] right
[1:39:49] that's where
[1:39:51] he fell short
[1:39:53] i had the faith
[1:39:54] that i that it being god's will he'd
[1:39:56] raise up and i believe that today had
[1:39:58] been god's will
[1:40:00] and every time i've gone through surgery
[1:40:02] i know that i can lay down on their
[1:40:03] table and i'm gonna come out of there
[1:40:05] because i have the faith that god's to
[1:40:07] raise me up if he doesn't so be it right
[1:40:10] and i'm going to go in there believing
[1:40:11] and that's what i want to tell everybody
[1:40:13] right and that's what i want to tell
[1:40:14] sterling and anybody that comes across
[1:40:16] any challenges
[1:40:17] your faith
[1:40:20] you've got to believe right right
[1:40:23] when they talk about this world being
[1:40:24] insane it's those people that don't
[1:40:26] believe i don't see how they can get
[1:40:27] from day to day right yeah i don't know
[1:40:30] that's right and that's why we have the
[1:40:31] chaos and everything we have out there
[1:40:33] right but i just wanted to share with
[1:40:35] you that
[1:40:37] that uh

[1:58:33] they're out there having their time
[1:58:34] hoopla and going on
[1:58:37] would you simply take the time and pause
[1:58:39] and
[1:58:40] take the communion
[1:58:42] and just think about our lord and sake
[1:58:45] what a wonderful
[1:58:47] wonderful day
[1:58:48] what a wonderful time it is
[1:58:52] nice
[1:58:54] and probably read it without even
[1:58:56] looking at it but
[1:58:57] i don't want to miss the wording
[1:58:59] you have a wonderful time tonight
[1:59:01] enjoyed everybody in the singing
[1:59:09] being here doing thank you god for
[1:59:11] sending brother jason to be with us
[1:59:14] preaching
[1:59:15] this weekend we had a wonderful time
[1:59:18] when we come into a new year and have a
[1:59:20] great time saying lord we can sit back
[1:59:23] and feast upon the word
[1:59:25] and let it dwell in our hearts but it's
[1:59:26] like our brother was saying
[1:59:29] to hear a message is fine
[1:59:33] but to be a message
[1:59:35] is different that's right
[1:59:37] but they're saying in the message now
[1:59:39] that brother branham
[1:59:41] wasn't infallible well i'll agree with
[1:59:43] him
[1:59:46] he had problems he was a human being
[1:59:49] but the message is in fact amen
[1:59:53] the message is
[1:59:56] thank god for the message amen
[1:59:59] but let's just read our scripture
[2:00:03] forever received with the lord that
[2:00:04] which also i delivered unto you that the
[2:00:06] lord jesus the same night in which he
[2:00:08] was betrayed took bread
[2:00:10] and when he had given thanks he break it
[2:00:12] and said take eat this is my body which
[2:00:14] is broken for you
[2:00:16] it's due in remembrance of me
[2:00:18] after the same manner also he took the
[2:00:20] cut when he had stopped saving
[2:00:22] this cup is the new testament in my
[2:00:24] blood this duty is often as you drink it
[2:00:26] in remembrance of me
[2:00:28] for as often as you eat this bread and
[2:00:30] drink this cup of the lord you douse you
[2:00:32] the lord's death till he come
[2:00:34] or for whosoever shall eat this bread
[2:00:36] and drink this cup of the lord
[2:00:38] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[2:00:41] and blood of the lord
[2:00:43] but let a man examine himself and so let
[2:00:45] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[2:00:46] cup
[2:00:48] but he didn't eateth and drinketh
[2:00:49] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[2:00:51] to himself
[2:00:53] not discerning the lord's body
[2:00:55] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[2:00:57] among you and many sleep
[2:01:00] first we would judge ourselves i love
[2:01:02] this scripture
[2:01:04] we should not be judged
[2:01:06] if we judge ourselves and everything
[2:01:08] gets out of the way but i love this see
[2:01:11] but when we're judged
[2:01:15] what does it say
[2:01:16] we're chasing to the lord that we should
[2:01:18] not be condemned with the world
[2:01:21] for my brethren when you come together
[2:01:23] to eat tarry one for another and if any
[2:01:25] man hungry let it eat at home that you
[2:01:27] come out together in the condemnation
[2:01:30] and the rest will i sit in order when i
[2:01:31] come
[2:01:34] it had gotten in the corinthians
[2:01:38] until they were just eating and
[2:01:41] meals and things you know and doing
[2:01:43] things
[2:01:45] paul was chosen to set an order
[2:01:50] telling them about the communion
[2:01:53] what a wonderful thing
[2:01:55] but about a man that
[2:01:57] was not there when
[2:01:59] the holy ghost originally failed
[2:02:03] but a man that was chosen to tell us
[2:02:06] about the communion
[2:02:09] and speak about it when others couldn't
[2:02:11] speak about it
[2:02:12] they could tell you what happened
[2:02:15] but he told us what it is
[2:02:18] listening to a tape the other day and
[2:02:20] what around them said that they were
[2:02:21] emphasizing
[2:02:23] you know doing and said
[2:02:25] and i know this happened
[2:02:26] that
[2:02:28] they would gather together and they
[2:02:29] would have a time together and they
[2:02:31] would
[2:02:32] listen to the writings of the bible the
[2:02:34] memoirs or what those big words are
[2:02:39] and then they were encouraged to follow
[2:02:41] after that
[2:02:42] and pattern after that
[2:02:45] and he said then the communion was
[2:02:47] passed
[2:02:48] and they took it
[2:02:50] and said
[2:02:51] then when some that were sick
[2:02:55] you know not able to be there
[2:02:57] he said they took the communion to their
[2:02:59] house
[2:03:01] and served them to communion
[2:03:03] we had a brother one time that was real
[2:03:05] sick at home and i just felt that to do
[2:03:07] that and we sent the communion
[2:03:10] to his house that night
[2:03:12] and the lord healed him
[2:03:14] amen
[2:03:18] don't you
[2:03:20] but says the bible said they come
[2:03:21] together to turn
[2:03:23] one for another
[2:03:24] let's just have a few moments of silent
[2:03:26] prayer as we pray one for the other
[2:03:28] praying that the lord would
[2:03:30] bless us all if there's anything in our
[2:03:32] hearts in line let's get it out of the
[2:03:34] way but we don't want to drink damnation
[2:03:36] to our own sails
[2:03:40] get rid of it no one is worthy to take
[2:03:43] the communion
[2:03:44] right but god has made us worthy
[2:03:48] by his blood
[2:03:51] so that we can protect let's all pray
[2:03:53] together
[2:04:09] father just be with each and every one
[2:04:11] of us here tonight
[2:04:12] we know and realize that as we just said
[2:04:14] we're not worthy for these things
[2:04:16] but you made us worthy
[2:04:19] you come on the scene and took our pro
[2:04:21] our
[2:04:22] side and took her place and made
[2:04:24] everything work you paid the price
[2:04:26] you even went to hell that i don't have
[2:04:28] to go right
[2:04:30] you took everything away that i don't
[2:04:32] have to worry about it
[2:04:33] now as we protected this communion in
[2:04:35] this new year
[2:04:36] may it have a meaning of greater
[2:04:38] understanding to each and every one of
[2:04:40] us that we make
[2:04:42] lord walk in your love
[2:04:44] we thank you
[2:04:45] we love you
[2:04:47] we thank you for the word that we heard
[2:04:48] tonight we ask you to bless our brother
[2:04:50] lord as he continues on and going and
[2:04:53] traveling all lord you take care of them
[2:04:55] and all in this blessing god
[2:04:57] we love you and we thank you in jesus
[2:04:59] name
[2:05:03] the bible said he took bread and blessed
[2:05:05] it
[2:05:06] father we thank you for this bread
[2:05:08] that's been made here tonight
[2:05:11] we know and realize that this is not
[2:05:13] your body
[2:05:14] but it's in representation
[2:05:16] so as we protected this we
[2:05:19] ask you to help us to remember
[2:05:21] we know that your body was a
[2:05:23] manifestation of the word of god
[2:05:26] it came into being
[2:05:28] father as we to not partake of this
[2:05:30] bread we ask you to help us to remember
[2:05:33] all of these things
[2:05:35] that we may all be our jesus to be
[2:05:38] sanctify the bread and the partakers
[2:05:41] in the name of jesus christ
[2:05:50] i never take the communion there
[2:05:53] my mind doesn't
[2:05:55] go back upon the children of israel
[2:05:59] now the last thing that they were
[2:06:01] getting ready to leave
[2:06:03] to go out
[2:06:05] to a land that
[2:06:07] had not been food
[2:06:11] the last thing they done was touch the
[2:06:12] communion
[2:06:16] that meaning to them that it would mean
[2:06:18] a new day
[2:06:20] a new time
[2:06:21] a new opportunity
[2:06:24] to be able to serve our god
[2:06:28] that bread would be there he never
[2:06:30] forgot him either
[2:06:33] you know he even came down and was the
[2:06:34] bread in the wilderness
[2:06:37] but they could eat the natural things
[2:06:38] that he or supernatural i guess you
[2:06:40] would call it things
[2:06:42] because that bread was perfect
[2:06:45] they never had any problems even their
[2:06:47] shoes the bible says
[2:06:49] grove with their feet
[2:06:51] and they were journeying through the
[2:06:53] land
[2:06:54] eating of that bread
[2:06:56] that was called manna
[2:06:59] that was an example there of speaking of
[2:07:01] what they had done
[2:07:03] before they were leaving
[2:07:05] take the communion
[2:07:10] commune means to fellowship
[2:07:13] it takes two people
[2:07:15] to fellowship
[2:07:17] and that way then you come and you
[2:07:19] fellowship around the altar of god
[2:07:22] you take bread
[2:07:25] we don't do like we used to do in the
[2:07:28] churches and we're not throwing those
[2:07:29] stones and nobody's just telling like it
[2:07:31] is
[2:07:33] we used to in the baptist we would order
[2:07:35] our bread
[2:07:37] it was made by someone else and brought
[2:07:39] in
[2:07:40] we would keep it for months before we
[2:07:42] took the communion
[2:07:44] and then we would just refreeze what was
[2:07:46] left over
[2:07:47] and keep it for the next time
[2:07:52] we found out that we're not supposed to
[2:07:54] do that
[2:07:55] that's right it's supposed to be burned
[2:07:59] you take the communion tonight
[2:08:01] this bread will be burned and finished
[2:08:05] before another day comes
[2:08:08] because we know that it represents the
[2:08:10] word of god man
[2:08:12] father we thank you for this wine notice
[2:08:14] went through the process of aging yes
[2:08:16] the word it has come to a position now
[2:08:18] that
[2:08:19] time will not bother you it will only
[2:08:21] make it better
[2:08:22] we realize realization this is not your
[2:08:25] blood
[2:08:26] no more than the bread was your body
[2:08:29] but you was telling us
[2:08:31] of a great thing that would take place
[2:08:34] that if we partake of that bread
[2:08:36] and that we would drink this wine
[2:08:39] that even in the natural tomorrow
[2:08:41] or even in this day
[2:08:44] this will create blood cells that's
[2:08:45] within our bodies because of the little
[2:08:47] bread and the little wine and as it does
[2:08:50] then we will be able to say we are a
[2:08:53] part of this
[2:08:55] we're not just playing a game
[2:08:58] we're sincere about it lord
[2:09:00] we ask you to sanctify the wine and the
[2:09:02] partakers
[2:09:04] that we may all be together as one in
[2:09:06] you
[2:09:07] in jesus name
[2:09:18] that's not the body and that's not the
[2:09:20] blood
[2:09:22] but it's in representation
[2:09:27] in representation
[2:09:29] of what our lord and savior done for us
[2:09:34] when he had finished the meal they had
[2:09:35] and he turned around and
[2:09:39] not contrary to some people think that
[2:09:41] he instituted something new
[2:09:44] way years ago was preaching a message
[2:09:46] from it in the old testament
[2:09:48] showing us that even when they took that
[2:09:51] lamb and that eight and they were
[2:09:53] getting ready to leave that
[2:09:56] they actually done what we're doing
[2:10:00] it was a manifestation there not just a
[2:10:03] new thing to come along in the new
[2:10:04] testament
[2:10:07] it was a
[2:10:09] happening that was in the word
[2:10:11] and jesus fulfilled it when he passed
[2:10:13] out the wine
[2:10:15] in the bread
[2:10:20] you say well
[2:10:23] do we take wine
[2:10:25] grape juice with sour
[2:10:30] we don't want that
[2:10:32] it can't be a type of
[2:10:34] something eternal if it's sours on you
[2:10:38] set your grape juice out somewhere
[2:10:41] and watch it
[2:10:43] it was wine
[2:10:46] well i you know you can't do that
[2:10:47] because everybody drinks wine but
[2:10:50] you know jesus turned water into wine
[2:10:55] we're a wedding one time
[2:11:00] but yet we don't want to have anything
[2:11:01] to do with mine or something
[2:11:04] it's because of what we've been told of
[2:11:06] our life
[2:11:07] instead of being what we are
[2:11:10] one little sip of wine i'm gonna put you
[2:11:14] he said if you're an alcoholic
[2:11:16] and tony take a sip you'll turn back to
[2:11:18] be an alcoholic
[2:11:19] not if you're delivered you won't
[2:11:29] but if you've been delivered
[2:11:31] then
[2:11:35] all is well
[2:11:40] a symbol
[2:11:43] what about in the symbol
[2:11:48] when we get there and have the wedding
[2:11:50] supper
[2:11:53] right
[2:11:54] looking forward to that
[2:11:56] you know it's going to be the communion
[2:11:59] it's not going to be beans and taters i
[2:12:01] don't want to mess up your doctrine
[2:12:03] it's not like that it's going to be the
[2:12:05] community
[2:12:08] unleavened bread
[2:12:11] made today destroyed tonight or this
[2:12:14] night
[2:12:15] do not hold it over because that
[2:12:17] that little manna that they ate in the
[2:12:19] wilderness you remember they tried to
[2:12:20] hold it over
[2:12:21] it soured on them
[2:12:24] you can't do that
[2:12:26] each day has a word and a thought from
[2:12:28] god and we must walk dirty
[2:12:32] not a happy new year then but
[2:12:34] let's partake together amen

[2:12:48] getting through
[2:12:50] we're going to have the foot washing
[2:12:52] tonight because
[2:12:53] we do firmly believe in
[2:12:57] the three ordinances
[2:13:00] foot washing
[2:13:04] water baptism and the communion
[2:13:08] but just to save time and not to do we
[2:13:11] won't have to put washing tonight
[2:13:14] but we will go down and kind of in
[2:13:15] reverse of where they did there in the
[2:13:18] in the bible because in the bible they
[2:13:20] ate a meal and then the third had the
[2:13:22] communion went out
[2:13:25] well a little different time isn't it so
