do it you know come down and hit him and do the best you can all right amen well good to see everybody amen let's turn in our scripture where we've been reading in Revelations one what I want to do today is kind of review and just comments this morning and then this afternoon we will the Lord willing to be picking up going into Revelations 5. we've been Fort this many 14 Services getting that far I wish that you could have been down with us at brother Collins's our Wednesday and that's what I want to try to do now is just more or less preach to you and and you know not give out notes or even just comments that come down looking across what I've got here and try to tie it all together because it's a foundation for understanding the the fifth chapter of the Book of Revelation amen so just remember that our precious Lord and our savior Our Redeemer our all in all and Jesus Lord is your name thank you for revealing that name unto us and telling us that we can ask anything in your name so we asked this day that you would come Among Us first to Lord be here and to speak to each heart as we open our eyes of our understanding unto you and let you speak to our hearts and lives you come and have your way with us Lord remember the sick ones Among Us just touch each one remember our wife Lord going tomorrow there to the doctor for more tests and just Lord let everything work out take away the pain because that's the hurting part that we're against and Lord just remember each one remember the last father and just bless him take away that temperature be with brother Dean's brother that Clinton and just touch him Lord and let everything be all right remember all the other sicknesses among us because we believe you and we thank you have your way now come and speak to our hearts in Jesus name amen we're going to Revelation 1 where we've been reading verse one through three it says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he said and signified it by his Angel into his servant John who by record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand it may be seated before that is blessing to the reading of the word no I worked as I said I wanted this time review what we've been talking about and then maybe make just a few comments and and you know and getting ready for starting the fifth chapter I thought you know on that that I would just really start preaching on the fifth chapter but then I seen that that we needed a background a study and an understanding you know to help us to get up to the place and and see then it would save a lot of trouble when we get there to just be able to to do a lot of comments and things and um so we'll try to start this afternoon on the fifth chapter of Revelation all right now I've had to bypass a lot of things I know in this even just in what we've been covering but I believe that we've gotten you know the point of what I've been trying to drive at right as you know uh to me the Book of Revelation that I keep saying is the bride's book it's a book about the Bride of Jesus Christ it shows you and I you want to read about us read the book of Revelation because it's bringing it down personally you know personal to where we're living our day and our age is shown in the Book of Revelation and see then that way we can can read it and see ourselves and what has been our point that in the Book of Revelation that you don't find Jesus by himself you find him showing himself in in with the bride in the bride and you know showing it uh showing the bride all right and that way then you can look at it and and see ourselves so then uh watch what we're trying to do we started out so let's just start from where we kind of begin on the series and we didn't spend much time in chapter one but we started out in chapter one and we we read our word that this is the Revelation that God gave to Jesus to give to John to to bring the word down to you and I except signified it by his Angel and and you know blessed are they that read this book or even hear well it's a blessing one because it's it's written to you and I to us a wonderful wonderful situation it's it's our book but it's a word of Prophecy remember what we covered that prophecy is divine inspiration from God in other words they're setting in order of scriptures so then really The Book of Revelation is a setting in order of all of the previous scriptures right all right now that was my point Darcy The Book of Revelations if you want to say in order so you go to the book that everybody sets their way from yeah and even in the message people we can't understand even after the prophet has brought these times you know they seem to shy away from The Book of Revelations but to me it would be the the book of Prophecy to cover together you know not prophesy prophecy c-y-p-r-o-p-h-e-c-y meaning the setting in order all right so all of the Bible is set in order by The Book of Revelation hey that was the point I tried to get you to realize that we can read the other gospels and we say well this is God's word well what do you think the Book of Revelation did right amen I mean is it just you know you know how I told you what I believe we have in uh you know I use it a lot because it's true but you have what you call a red letter edition of your Bible which means that everything Jesus says is put in red letter you know for to help you well I believe the whole Bible ought to be put in red light I think it ought to be read from the beginning of Genesis to the finishing of Revelation because you know of what it's doing all right but now we we've covered these things in trying to to understand so then we went through as I said the first chapter and covering then the uh the one standing Revelation 1 13 one standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks like under the son of man gird about the pouch with the golden girdle you know and all of that was showing God in Bride forms believe God is women how feminist see it's it's the Bride of Jesus Christ says one life unto the son of man it didn't say these on a man because it wasn't like unto the son of man right well if it's one life unto the son of man it would be the son of man in another form right right all right and that son of man in another form is his bride all right so we started all seeing ourselves and I told you I said even before John went into writing about the church ages and the thing he told the bride how beautiful she was right how wonderful she she was set forth in the word to to uh you know understand who we are it was our book right well then we kind of baptized the church ages because you know they're more or less of a self-explanatory of reading when and the prophet read what he says on those things and and you know then it would cover down but then we got up to when we started there we found out John said in chapter 1 that he was in the spirit right me he was in the spirit well now if you don't have the Holy Spirit you can't get in the spirit right right amen now that sensible or playing amen and if you talk about a eagle well if you're not an eagle then you can't understand equal language amen you can't eat Eagle food me and all that it'll make you sick right but see then you know you don't want to go that way so John repeats then in chapter four that it's in the spirit emphasizing what if we don't get into the Holy Spirit we can't understand the word of God I don't care what we do how much we read or how much we can quote if it's not revealed to us by the Holy Spirit and made manifest by the Holy Spirit what good is it right amen it's only letters on the page so you can say well I I've got it here I can argue with anybody now about it well that's about all you're going to do then right if that's your point I was sitting listening to a person uh you know testifying preaching uh one time I won't say when but um uh you know I mean it just really got into it about the Holy Spirit and things and the first thought I was I thought well boy he's sure taking a lot of time you know he's cutting into my time you know getting to work he's taking the preaching a while but you know what I sat there and thought a minute and I thought Lord that's all that person's got there that's right that's the only guy you know you know the Baptist that's all they've got is what little bit of God they know to imagine this Presbyterian Pentecostal whatever it's what little bit they know is all they've done well I wouldn't want to take that away if you think I try to destroy people in their beliefs you you've really misunderstood me right because I never wanted to destroy anybody's belief if the Holy Spirit can't destroy your belief then what good am I right you know if he can't change you what can I do and that's why that you see very few people are one to the true message is because most people are trying to beat people with the message instead of preaching the message that's right you know trying to force you to believe in one God trying to force you to believe in a prophet okay try to force you to believe in all kind of things instead of allowing the Holy Spirit to do it right amen and I wouldn't I wouldn't go to a Baptist church today and stand up there and say you're all wrong you're false no I do the best I could to try to preach Jesus Christ amen in the realm they were in and see when I go about preaching in the message a long time which bird a little but I I try to preach in the realm of the people right that's there right amen I don't go preach to see youth marriage and divorce you know all of these things like that out somewhere else I come here and do it right now if I'm invited to do it I would be glad to go and do it you know I mean that but that's fine but get the point see and I'm sitting there and I really thought I don't want to destroy that person right if that's all they got it's all it's all that you've got is one God Heaven helped me to try to destroy it right help me to try to build it up you know clear it up give a better understanding help you to to get more information you know more things we me and this man were talking one diamond and I mean he was really contrary to me and he was just this is a long time ago and he was trying to think of something I said I'll just quote the quote for you I don't agree with you and don't agree with what's the way you're going to use the quote but I said here's the quote and I run it you know I run it all for it go you know I mean I I was trying to help a human being if he wanted to be blind let him be blind I can't change that but see I think that's the point that we would have is to try to get the message out amen the to help people understand right that's right not to try to tell them how bad they are right because when you do that that spirit is raising up in that person and they're not listening to you they're waiting on you as a prophet said to shut up where they can refute what you're saying they're sitting there running quotes in their mind you know and their their scriptures and stuff and it shouldn't be that way we should have the spirit of Christ he didn't write down on him until it come down to really hard right and really the people he didn't write down on very much you go by study your Bible it's always in religious Pharisees he didn't say to the people you're of your father the devil right he specifically put it in one point right but see just think about it so then let's just do what we can to help each other all right you know I mean if there's anywhere in the world I could help a uh the pope or wrong to understand his uh what he was even here for you know I would go talk to him and turn it he said yeah but he's here to take us down well I think that's what we need we need to be put down a whole lot where we can cut out all the garbage can and get on with the word of God find out whether it's real then they're hard or not that's right amen and just understanding it's not all that big it's just believing right that's right Danny come up here Wednesday when he walked away I grant I knew his headache was gone it might take him more I called him an insulator and he said I'm all right beside you right there that was gone right but see he had to get it from going right he couldn't get it for me I just knew it was gone right amen he can reveal things to you was he doing this go out and broadcast it no do the best you can to help people all right forgive me won't charge you on that part okay because that to me is giving in the spirit let's get into the Holy Spirit and and relax and and just let God speak to her hearts and you know I mean they used to say and I agree with them that's all right he used to say before you play a tape now said you're going to need to pray 30 minutes well I that's a good point that's all right man I'm not against that but I didn't have the 30 minutes I only had 30 minutes yeah and that was to get me a tape listening to and riding down the highway or something so I surely couldn't start praying you know and and stopped in the middle Expressway and and all like that so you just say Lord help me get me out of the way where I can listen if I get a chance later I'll pray you know but that's you know people don't understand me like that I just I but I'm just trying to to help you and I get in the spirit of God right amen and if we're not born again we can't get in the spirit right if we're not an eagle we can't understand we run around we gave it to you at the end of the message every Wednesday brother and said a true Eagle we'll understand a true if it's a true Eagle right amen right if it's not there's no way you can convince anybody that's right you can't convince people about uh the power of quotes just preach the gospel and go on and let it be but let's get in the spirit of it all right now like I said you notice in Revelations 1 I think it's about verse 10. John was talking about getting in the spirit get in the spirit you know on the Lord's Day then he comes over to chapter four and he says he's getting in the spirit of the Lord and that Spirit of the Lord is you know the days of man is gone what is the the the the the Lord's day when the day it's not Sabbath it's not a date or a time John was only out of Patmos for two years I'm quoting brother random as I look down see for two years on the Isle of patents getting the Book of Revelation so it certainly wasn't one day it's when the days of man is over is the Lord's day amen all right see then when it's over with then we can can receive from God what we have need of and you know relax in that all right and what did we find that the Book of Revelations is coming on over into chapter four it's not only the uncovering of the person of Christ but it's the revelation of his future work in the oncoming seven Church ages The Book of Revelation is not a revealing of Christ it's revealing where Christ is he's in his bride that's that you know that's the Revelation that God give to Jesus to give to John said Jesus didn't know he's part in the Kingdom that's right until he comes to the part of that was then he could come to John to tell it right it all comes out the end that we we need to have the Book of Revelations open unto us and we found I preached one message in there that we found that it would take a special people amen that's right of special people to be able to understand it couldn't be revealed remember I gave even a quote it couldn't be revealed in the days of of the line the ox the man he couldn't be revealed until this day that's right that was my emphasis to try to get across this past Wednesday it couldn't be revealed until the Eagles come amen see everybody said the eagle period and I'm running around to the Eagles right amen special people amen you know what types of special people to understand this message I said you got to be born again then you got to hear the message but then if the Holy Spirit doesn't reveal that it is not put together by fifo Ministry where are we amen right now I didn't quote these things but around was when it said it I preached it to you over the series according to my Bible according to Prophet the bible ministries for the professional sign amen all right now you said well I should try and make something about yourself no I'm just being what I am I mean and I I couldn't help it that God made me this way he chose me I certainly didn't choose myself all right but see the key to understand anything is to first get in the spirit of what is being revealed all right right then put your mind into what is being made known right not just put it into the basis or I'll read this ask God to reveal it amen right amen you got a question about something you know I gave you one one question in there that they asked right around said you know what is the carcass and one of the Eagles well you know he explained it right the carcass being the word of God and the Eagles the one who could eat the food right that's the way I do I say well all right now Lord I want to speak on Revelations five now but I won't know what the prophet had to say yep I got one brother he said let me study these things out and said I'll come back by here and preach on this statue of perfect man one time here years ago and uh he said I don't want to listen to what y'all had to say when he came back maybe six months a year later and uh he would have been really good if he just listened to a few things that was said because he had the Rapture coming in the sixth Church age because the six churches brotherly kindness and he had a quote from Brother Randall Rapture comes into brotherly kindness age so then he was totally off so he wasted six months of studying if he just listened and got a lineup I mean then he would have seen what's going on all right that's right but just think about it now so then we realized it we see God in Bride form throughout the Book of Revelation where do we get to the land at the seven horns and seven eyes right the one that breaks the scene away amen right but we went through trying to find something and seeing that what that the bride went up in a Rapture in Revelations 4 1. John did as it taught the Rapture but one day we will be raptured up not as a type right and then we went into the symbols of the open door be in Jesus Christ then we went through the voices the same voice that John heard on Earth you know amen and that's what he was looking to see Jesus Christ but when he looked he saw a door because he's a prophet he's to receive symbols all right he hears your voice it's the same voice he heard on Earth he saw the throne and he saw one sitting on the throne we saw that was what that was not Jesus's Throne that's the Father Strong right and that's the baptism with the Holy Ghost right he is strong will be in the millennial reign I gave you these quotes he was not only as strong that Throne belongs to Spirit God Amen not human flesh but there was a human flesh sitting on the drum all right but he was a look upon and described him as to what Jasper and sardine stone one Reuben and Benjamin all right the Patriarchs then we went on down into the 24 elders and found out they were the 12 apostles and 12 Prophets that would run around the throne we went through the rainbow that John Saul around about the throne all right but see if you go back and read Revelations one real careful you'll see that that was a rainbow that John was seeing in there in Revelations one like in the emerald like under things of course the revelation of Jesus Christ it's not a another something that would be hard to understand we went around that the rainbow would be was around about the throne and that we in here in this life only get a half of a rainbow from one part of the earth down to the other but when we get dire signifying that there was more to be revealed amen and when we get married to reveal the word to us down to the endless ages and it'd be a great time all right amen we went on over to talking about the the Judgment seat because of the Thunders and the Lightnings and things so that would take that part all the way and you go clean over to to about the 17th or 18th chapter somewhere about the the where the why throwing judgment is happy we found that we sit on the Judgment not before the Judgment all right amen all right thank you Lord that'll be a wonderful thing won't it amen to know that we missed the tribulation yeah do you think we went into the combat Beast Galatians 4 6-8 and we saw that Ezekiel run around and said it's all that through back the Book of Ezekiel uncovered it he saw the line the offsets called a calf nerd it was a lion the ox a man the eagle in Ezekiel and it was the wheel in the middle of the wheel and it was like a chariot just running doing you know but it was in symbolics and what was that that was Israel in Journey the prophet said amen Israel and her journey down through the wilderness encourage it right on into the Promised Land and John sees the same thing in Revelation 4 right right when he sees that he's on the throne and the prophet said positioned in other words set in steel right amen because he goes either traveling yeah amen the moving of Israel Israel we do this thing and you say well what how would you understand it without a prophet to tell us we couldn't understand it right amen right I mean to be guessing what these means well I think that's a vision yeah like a cupid with a little arrow shooting them you know I think that's what it means well what do you no I don't think it means that we see a prophet's not telling you what he thinks he's telling you what the symbols are right brother Brown says then John speaking of it he could see in symbols what it was and bring it down to you and I all right see then the combat Beast is what's all Israel was seen in Journey but listen did you notice that I mean Ezekiel Ezekiel seeing Israel right John see him at the throne right amen not a vast difference now where else could you go she didn't have to be the prophet right if God hadn't sent us a prophet where would we be amen we wouldn't have known about Ezekiel that's right right we wouldn't have known about John but we certainly wouldn't have known the in between okay man now I hope he was catching on what I'm saying about it you know country Services see Ezekiel Saw Israel and journey you know brother Brown who could look above and see all these things you know what he can see us in Journey Ezekiel Saw Israel in Journey Don't you think a prophet could see us in Journey yes was it a haphazard thing to just happen that he would back in the church ages in those times that he would start talking about these combat beasts and he would say it was Matthew Mark Luke and John he said see there guarding the book of Acts all right so you go in the book of Acts he says repent everyone and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ well that ain't red letter yeah I'm going to the red letter I'm going over here in Matthew and read so Jesus in Matthew says baptized in the name of the follow us on audio now Peter said the Lord Jesus Christ all right amen well I'll take what Jesus said amen I'm glad you will will you no Jesus didn't say baptized in the name of the Father the name of the son the name of the Holy Ghost you know three different names he said baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost all one night you see Matthew's guard in the book of Acts right he's telling you about the book of Acts he's guarding back run around and said see that's where it goes Matthew Mark Luke and John he said they guard the book of Acts if you want to know anything you go in the book of Acts and you read but then you want to know what it is you go back to Matthew Mark Luke and John said in my name you'll cast out devils there's nothing right ma'am guarding the book of Acts in other words guarding even the rest of the Gospel of the rest of the writings of Paul Peter in them as they wrote Matthew Matthew Mark Luke and John is guarding them amen Peter would come along because of Matthew Mark Luke and John taking place he said now I have a more sure word of Prophecy amen right within his heart he had an experience of what happened on amount of transfiguration we know right now you see what the prophet's doing he's given us the Journey of the combat bees there's no writing here to pull this from you know what I mean you didn't say well this church yet he was under this and this church ages under that and this this here and this is here not right now you don't even have symbols Ezekiel you had symbols right of Israel and travel but you don't have that but a prophet picked that part up and he said see then you can see now Matthew Mark Luke and John as they guard the book of Acts right then he picked up and he said getting ready for the seals to break you begin to talk about the combat Beast chapter five I mean uh he mentioned it away back because it's in the church Age series but then he goes over mainly to the fifth seal governing the combat Beats he said see they're lying the ox a man the eagle and you ain't got scripture there to read from do you understand but we got a prophet that's right to tell us what the scriptures are saying amen then we can read descriptions right is that the way it's supposed to be then that way it's not our ideas he said one day he said our individual he said these combat beasts are thus saith the Lord that's right you remember that I gave them to you so it's coming down and he covers line that cops Amanda Eagle he said that line went out in that early church age to combat that Antichrist and went forth into anti-teaching a teaching contrary the word right and he said that line lashed it down even as much as and he's still all the way through the church you know the church ain't you but just the ministry part of it because it was a power among the people remember that's right it wasn't just them in the book of Acts right but Paul and then even come on out with irenius and polycar it wasn't just them it was a power among the people my brother Gary Atkins said that Beast that Zoom Beast wrong one if he gets any power you got to get you and I who gave that beast power in the Dark Ages who killed the people not a demon right come on it was in a demon that got in people that gave him the seat of authority in their life right was he down through there then that second one that Ops starting entire and going through the Dark Ages yep sure wasn't that through that Dark Ages they would be giving her life for the gospel read thoughts of The Book Of Martyrs about all of the people 68 million of their own record the catholic's record under that Arch that sacrificial then he covers what the third Beast is what the man he said see there the others were animals we said now it's a man named shrewd he said that Antichrist wrote out with charging for prayers all kind of things he said man rode out against it Martin Luther come out sitting the dress she'll live by faith but it was the spirit of God Among the people right amen in that age right he calls them like Wesley Luther Knox any Calvin all of them great men that through their intellectual ability down through there was when they brought in the printing press to the smart man but see the Catholic had taken the Bible away from the people they could only read what they wanted them to read all right but here come excuse me here come the the anointing upon man to start making printing presses and doing all kind of things right and when they did then you come out what you know is the Bible from the shrewdness of man a power among the people but then when you come down to the fourth one what is it fourth one was an eagle we get out of the fourth one say the eagle oh yeah we can understand that that was brother Brown all right all right George Paul the lion right George Luther the man but what about the power among the people well we ain't supposed to have anything we just sat there and waiting on the bus to pull up when these days are all going to be a win that's why they started and now I've told you what I plain about it that's why they started all of that that brother randoms come got to come back put up the tent go across the country and preach well I've always said what I believed about it and put it in plain language here in the church that's 30 40 days between the resurrection and the time of the change of the body and the Rapture he preached all he wants to about the country to the people that's no problem but it's not sitting down waiting on the bus what if you go up here to Gainesville like I've told you before about it the old bus depot used to be down at the train station that was where it was at down at the train depot was where the bus depot was at same place but when brother for cash come that time he wanted me to take him up busty boy I said there's not one in Gainesville they closed out the one at the railroad track he said they got one I said they don't have one I know where it used to be this closed out he said well here's the number call it he knows more about the time to you I called him it was up in town they had put the dust bus depot up in town but I pointed what are you sat down at the railroad track waiting on the bus depot all right all right if nothing else after five-fold industry's job right we get you set in the right place right well you won't be waiting at the train station for the bus right sorry we'd be set in the right place to get ready but you see in that you know all the other everybody will agree that the line the officer man was a power among the people you know all the people that age and 68 million being killed certainly wasn't just one man was it all right Paul Irene is a comma you're the wind just Columbia Martin and you wait there's one there's one we see why can't we see it's the power among the people that's right that's right why can't we see them the things that we brought out at the last our Wednesday night ask those Matthew Mark Luke and John guard the book of Acts okay you go along with that of the guards of the altar well so is the line the oxalom and the eagle to guard in the church ages that's right thank you then we want to just do something to do away with it do something do away with it what do you want to do to that farm leave it where's that right even in the Antichrist he gets off the White Horse and gets on a red horse you know what the White Horse just keeps going right amen that white horse is a power among the people it just keeps right on going it's still riding today every no no no it's a red horse and a black horse isn't it yeah but you see that's what we think we think we're smart we really got it figured out brother Dale don't understand that Antichrist was a white horse when he got all gone red white horses disappeared now showed me that in the message in the Bible said he rides all the way now you if you want the direct quote I'll give it this way and you figure it out he said that white horse rider the Antichrist rides to Eternity you want that quote that's right he don't stop he said wait a minute you put an eternal life no oh brother Brown didn't say it read the quote I'll be glad to get it for you he said he rides too eternity he loves difference in riding to Eternity and going into eternity a lot of difference but you see Church then those combat beasts was guarding down through there that's right yep that's right when that Antichrist got off one horse got on another one another Ministry just come in because the Bible said when the enemy comes in like a flood and spirit of the Lord will raise up a standard right that line Ministry of the true word of God is still here today because he's Hebrews 13 8. all right the ox is still here why because like I was saying a moment ago why would I want to take away somebody's little bit of thing that they've got why can't we buy with them why can't we think about the Beast of Burden no bless God I'm an eagle I'm a ripper with a beak yeah yeah but you better remember in this day it all winds up together that's right the lion the ox the man and the eagle that's right the shrewdness of man is still here even in this old day old brain that keeps me from being caught with these old doctrines that goes around it catches 99 of the people amen especially preachers why can't you see that that man Ministry is still right here brother brought him sitting Luther looked at it and said that cannot be right that is just the blood of an animal it is not even the blood of Jesus come on why can't we still use that brain today see that doctrine of Two Souls seven Thunders peruses River Jordans it's not true that's right why because we've got enough sense to be able to figure it out some of the things you don't even need to Holy Ghost to figure out for you right right that's right you know there's ministers in this message says the great revelation of the seventh seal is polygamy you can have all the lies you want well it don't take no Holy Ghost to figure that one out right it don't take a holy ghost to find out that's wrong playing Common Sense shows you that ain't right right man could you see that line the ox the man and the eagle is all here at one time in the end time that's right amen that prophet of God had all of those Ministries bottled up into one man what about that yeah come on you tell me that that man didn't have it wouldn't he strike on the word he said you can't get an eagle off the word right man but then he'd turn around and bear with people and go do what they said to do instead of what God even said to do some of that sure because he was an ox I remember one it really caught me he said he was going to preach in a place one time and said this man said run around and said I know how you preach he said and I believe it but he said most of my people are legalism you remember that quote run around and said I wanted to hug you well you know he didn't preach against a lot of things when he preached that night he said I wanted to hug the man just because he had the love of the people in his heart right amen why have we lost the love of the ox and the things you know the burden to put up with one another Pride we lost that app like I always tell you see everything I don't like to be like I am but I'm just made this way I'm sorry forgive me a lot of you I heard you even say I don't see why in the world I can't see that go when I come in a message I sing it right off and here I am saying why did it take me two years to pound that into your head but that wasn't right that you see I'm an ox I don't beat you today you think I do and I see some of you that still ain't pounded into your heads about some of it but yet you sing it when you first single first time I heard that I seen it no you're lying through your teeth actually in combat beats for all four right here now right that's right this age the power among the people amen that's why I wrote around and made the statement then he told us about the theorons and the two different words and then he come down you remember how we was ending up the other night and we came down to what brought him Adam and had brother Brown had to say about it I won't call him to pull these up but you remember when we got over to the paragraph 186 of the seal book The Fifth seal the fourth Beast was sent forth to combat the Antichrist in his last Beast he's talking about the right he said the fourth fourth living Beast was an eagle now you just out of the ages instead of the scriptures it's the eagle in the Bible the life's age was an eagle age and God Likens the ego To His prophets okay on the last Age The Eagle age a revealer of the truth he sends down the Eagle at the end of it Likens his Eagle to profits see we don't want to say Prophet one all right if you only go ahead with the next one then 70. you remember what we were talking about the astronaut age this is the astronaut age this is the eagle age we've got Eagles you remember that Wednesday Prophets Rising into the heavens well yeah there you go you're looking for somebody up no survey and not me to take it over either God's already done it the eagle arrived in the prophet's Ministry that's right he said I'm looking for this great one to come that word he brought around go any higher than the opening of the seals and he was looking for the great one to come he said well he preached marriage and more excuse me my mind is still good I'm 72 but it still remembers that the seals was revealed the American divorce was revealed and sealed the Rapture was revealed in the sea right yeah serpent seed was revealed in the sea of which was preached in 58 right come on but church do you understand what he's saying yes we got Eagles prophets reminds me look at the next one this is a revealer of the truth that's been falling all through the age now we know who brought the crew but how could it ever be revealed until the Eagles plural land come on look at the next one healed away from them until the age of the Eagles appeared well right down to where it's supposed to be right right I didn't did they give you these others 20 no 20 yeah I gave him 20. okay he's ahead of me today let's meet me today but I told him I wouldn't go to use no quote no we just don't breathe but look what he said now remember he see his people being Eagles especially His prophets and then he likened himself to an eagle he's Jehovah eagle and we are his English the little ones and how he feeds us with his own mouth interruptive her life look there's nothing will take its place not nothing will take the place of the Eagles but the real food Eagles food and we are eagles so we have to have Eagles food not social again they're not political speeches not some little sticks and soul party but we need some Eagles food fed from the mouth of Jehovah Eagle that's why he likened us unto Eagles Eagle is a far stronger bird he can fly higher than any other bird that there is and that's the reason Jehovah likened us to unto Eagles you just simply can lift up higher than the ordinary bird I mean I'm specially speaking about eagles Jehovah's what voice amen you see what I'm talking about amen rise up on wings of an eagle but you see we don't want to make it all in brother Brown then you missed the whole book of Revelations you're speaking of the bride of Christ example yep all right then no wonder people don't understand the message or the hour because they're trying to understand it and making themselves some kind of a of a crow or a good Hulk the coach run around was the eagle but Robin said it was a power among the people right I didn't make these quotes your Prophet did when the Eagles the world would appear when the Eagles would come thank God for the prophet that brought the message amen because you and I couldn't comprehend of us being Eagles if he hadn't come and laid the way amen that's right like I've always told you we spend a lot of emphasis and thank God it's true David did kill Goliath but then David didn't have to fight no more why because the children of Israel rose up and went after the enemy I think it's about time you and I catch on what's going on a true Eagle will understand if he's a true evil if not he'll try to interpret it by being a crow or a buzzard maybe a hawk it won't show her High Enough we got to be an astronaut right right how much did the prophet speak about an astronaut what Good's an astronaut if you don't have a shield for it to go in it's been up 42 000 feet I think the highest I remember recording but you know you couldn't go over what 10 somewhere above 10 000 feet you got to have options you know right I know we've been ten thousand feet in the prop plane so I know it's ten thousand feet that you could go without an oxygen but after you growing up that plane's got to be pressurized and you got to have oxygen company that's right yeah a lot of people have died because of being too high you remember I remember reading one time where something happened on the top of the plane broke off we know a lot of people died you know why you took all the oxygen with it and they couldn't drop fast enough to be able to save the ones you got to be pressurized amen what do you think we've been doing 40 something years trying to get a spaceship built that would take us to outer space because your profit sin interplanetary travel was a type of the Rapture right right interplanetary travel so we've been to the moon now we're going to Mars we're going on up right what about it Eagles amen at least you want to start acting like that I remember a man said one time they said something about it they were doing and I agree with it but as people you know they were just bubble nights and RAM his one brother said boy I think that's so much Eagles he said there's probably much chickens to me I agreed with it because your kids can fly but somebody's going to get out of here somebody's going to be changed I'm on the shrink them enough somebody's going short with the Eagles right and the message I'm preaching unto us the things that we have need of that's right what is that song about the Little Eagles Fly you know flap your wings Little Eagles just about time okay sure I know there's been a lot of fanaticism went with the message of talking about eagles because everybody's wanting to become Papa evil right I have a lot of people come around trying to stuff it down your throat about Papa Eagle you know in other words they was the big eagle nope you had one eagle brother Brown was the one that brought the message there's not another to bring the message there's just egos to eat Eagle food and become equals that's right and eating Eagle's food won't make you chickens okay that's right but eating chicken food won't make you evil see that's just a foundation of what we're going into it right but have you caught on I've had two people come to me about this message I mean really come to him and talk to him about it now as long as you say I enjoyed it and everything I've had two people I mean really say something that I knew they knew what I was talking about I think it's about time you wake up become Eagles find out whether it's Eagle food if it's not Eagle food go somewhere else where there is some but what about a power among the people like I said the other day who made it to work such a way you ride down the road and on houses that are not even related to in any way Christianity maybe there's Eagles on them you want a novelty store and they'll have whole racks of eagles is that only for the Believers of the message to buy you know right it's an eagle age science has went beyond all things in this age it went from a horse and bogey to an astronaut right and somebody's going to be changed come on somebody's going to be changed amen when I just believe what part of it okay this thing that opened the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart and if I stop in the middle of it and look at Brother Richard and go then you just stop her right there tell everybody watch Brother Richard come close your eyes and play and sing watch Brother Richard because he's going to be the key when I tell him to hold it there's going to be something I want to say okay let's stand together I'm ready here for out your power and just keep playing you realize with yourself so for how many years four or five years I changed a song when they changed his mind or a thought or what we're doing right we used to saying I love you you've never been like a normal turkey to the minute you sing only believe we've always sung what was related to what was taking place I've always been my wife doing I began to see something hoping you'd catch on seeing what I'm talking about the revelation and we are the Bride of Jesus Christ we're the legal soaring in the skies you know we're gonna go surely every one part I left out of chapter four all those that are in chapter four one day finally they're flying through the sky foreign 20 Elders that's not an angel well you have the 12 apostles for the old testamental well for the new as Eagles but you know they come to one place there when they seen it they they were singing Holy Holy Holy yeah Lord God Almighty holy holy holy just like the Angels were singing but these are not angels but angels and you got two of them you got seraphim those combat bees that are grounded as Caribbeans and seraphim right I left the whole message out go on because I wanted you to see one thing those combat needs to be in there no 420 Elders throw their crowns down Angels don't have crowns prophets and see their beings the Eagles are still singing holy holy holy Lord God Almighty you're not a they're not alive what you see Church they're trying to bring him out and I said you don't think we're gonna be right around this Crown you know what he said he said you're my crown see this church will be my crown right oh foreign thinking about laying down my crown he said you come right across from the messages and we lay our crown down in this field okay lay our Crown before the feeder juice because if we don't do it here we're not gonna lay any ground if we don't sing Holy Holy Holy what it means we're not going to change it back from outside your phone and think about it you're saying bro you Open the Eyes of My Heart let me see you Lord romantic music let me see what's going on why do you want to say uh how many times I scream at all right whatever what little bit we've got We Lay open for you father we thank you we pray that what we said is and Worthy that was to see Lord that we must match their before we can go there so then we got to see you is holy holy holy Lord God Almighty then we got to cast our crowns as they do it in Revelations 4 Lord they cast their crowns before you giving you all the honor the glory and all it's not anything that we could do or have done is what you've done you made a way and you gave us a prophet to bring us the message to show us these things the symbols and break them but then not to just give us words to repeat but to speak to our hearts that you may be able to take those words that he has spoken and be able to Quicken into our hearts and lives yes see Who We Are that Prophet one day said when that bride realizes who she is and what she's doing here but she'll be gone so that Satan will be powerless before won't have any effect on me we thank you Lord thank you for being you and revealing yourself and thank you for revealing us because the prophet said the bride is part of the mystery and must be revealed so that's all we're trying to do speak about you Lord you said you sent your word and healed us we thank you for that yes blessing God now lead us in your love in Jesus name the Eyes of My Heart Lord power shine away
