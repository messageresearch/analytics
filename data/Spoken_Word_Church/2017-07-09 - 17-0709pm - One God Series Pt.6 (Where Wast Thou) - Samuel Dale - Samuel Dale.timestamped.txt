[16:38] trips and times Lord and the youth camps
[16:42] and the things and we pray that you'd

[16:53] afternoon as we try to speak about you
[16:55] we love you and we thank you forgive our
[16:57] sins cleanse us from all things we love
[17:01] you in Jesus name Amen John 1 in the
[17:09] beginning was the word and the Word was
[17:11] with God in the Word was God the same
[17:13] was in the beginning with God all things
[17:16] were made by him and without him was not
[17:18] anything made that was made
[17:21] in him was life and the life was the
[17:24] light of men and the light shine us in
[17:27] darkness and the darkness comprehended
[17:29] it not let's go over to which will be
[17:33] our thought for the afternoon and some
[17:37] scriptures and veins but revelations 13
[17:40] 8 now all that dwell upon the earth
[17:43] shall worship Him whose names are not
[17:45] written in the book of life of the lamb
[17:49] slain from the
[17:51] foundation of the world you may be
[17:53] seated over that is blessing to the
[17:56] reading of the word now we know for sure
[17:59] talking about will be getting into the
[18:02] book of the Lamb we know that like in
[18:06] Daniel it says there's books and
[18:08] revelations that call them books there's
[18:11] many there's books that God is like
[18:15] records and stuff like that you know and
[18:18] you've got the part of like the book of
[18:22] life apart we'll be dealing with early
[18:25] things that transpire and then finally
[18:27] you get to the point of bringing it to
[18:30] eternal life but now remember that the
[18:33] book of the of the Lamb that was slain
[18:36] from the foundation of the world is the
[18:39] eternal Word of God
[18:41] all right it is a book of names and it
[18:46] will be there with not B it is the names
[18:50] of those that are the born-again
[18:51] believers upon the earth now there are
[18:54] books that will cover other things and
[18:56] you can have your name in the book of
[18:59] life like Judas was but that name can be
[19:02] removed with names cannot be removed
[19:05] from the Lamb's Book of Life the eternal
[19:09] section brother Branham in one statement
[19:13] mentions then talks about the book of
[19:16] the lamb slain and says Judas was dire
[19:19] and that was his but you've got to
[19:21] remember that he's putting you know it
[19:24] comes to be put together it has to be
[19:27] because you can't be in the the eternal
[19:30] section of the book because there's many
[19:32] sections or that one book and you can't
[19:35] have that your name could be in the
[19:38] eternal section and removed right what
[19:41] that ought to be settled even though you
[19:43] could find self quote to do this or that
[19:45] you got to remember truth his truth he's
[19:48] not there just something he's missing or
[19:51] we're missing to understand and I'd
[19:54] rather say we are but that's that's
[19:56] alright but that's what we're going to
[19:58] try to deal with for a little bit
[20:01] because our thoughts has been and I'm
[20:04] try this afternoon to do some of what I
[20:07] was doing this morning is it's just
[20:09] quoting things without having to read
[20:11] without reading so much but we will
[20:14] cover some things but what I want to do
[20:19] is to think about what the Bible covers
[20:24] then we've been speaking out for two or
[20:27] three weeks on this one thought that
[20:29] there was some things taking place in
[20:33] heaven before the foundation of the
[20:36] world
[20:36] all right we know in for surety that we
[20:40] were not back dire so we put that in
[20:43] upfront as peoples and identities in the
[20:46] situation's
[20:47] and we'll read it after a while and the
[20:50] Prophet said not our being here that's
[20:53] not it and he said that they asked him
[20:56] where we spirits back there and he says
[20:58] no you were nothing you would only in
[21:01] the mind of God all right so before the
[21:04] foundation of the world you'll be
[21:06] dealing with the mind of God and we
[21:09] found that what have we studied talking
[21:11] about the self existing one that dwelt
[21:15] along with his thoughts all right see
[21:18] then in his mind as we covered this
[21:20] morning surely then we can comprehend if
[21:23] there is a God or it and if not we might
[21:27] we'll go and forget it
[21:28] if you just don't believe that God is so
[21:31] eternal and his thoughts are eternal and
[21:34] in the basis that he could never even
[21:38] have a new thought he can't change his
[21:41] mind his thoughts are perfect and
[21:43] eternal was he then being that then
[21:46] surely we would be able to think about
[21:48] do we try to limit God to put him to
[21:51] wordid he was he would not know before
[21:54] the world ever begun everything that
[21:57] would ever happen on earth and every
[22:00] person that would be here ever than that
[22:02] that would be here and every time that
[22:04] mattad that it's our infinite things
[22:07] that God can deal with surely we want to
[22:11] realize that he is the self existing one
[22:15] and that he dwelt along with those
[22:17] stocks which the Prophet says on who is
[22:22] just Melchizedek he talks about his
[22:24] desires
[22:26] alright attributes what is an attribute
[22:29] we were talking about this morning so
[22:32] you are the attribute of your parents
[22:34] you know that's that's attribute
[22:36] attribute covers many thoughts in the
[22:39] form that that attribute can just be a
[22:41] desire of a person or something and
[22:44] certainly you don't sit around and think
[22:46] I mean what do you do all day long you
[22:49] get up in the morning cut it off and run
[22:52] your brain all day to keep them
[22:53] overheating you know and cut it back
[22:54] only once why when you need it or is it
[22:57] working all the time if it's working all
[23:01] the time then you're doing some thinking
[23:03] well when I think about God being that
[23:06] way are you going to limit him to where
[23:09] that he would not be thinking so then my
[23:13] point lately has been to dry to drive to
[23:16] the reality of a living God to word that
[23:19] we can see that even though we would sum
[23:24] up the point of by way of the prophets
[23:27] message or something that he dwelt alone
[23:30] and and there was nothing there with him
[23:33] but his thoughts surely then we think
[23:39] about that in his mind that he would
[23:43] know everything that would ever happen
[23:45] on this earth in any form well then you
[23:49] know that would if you don't listen to
[23:51] the talks I might sometimes I don't know
[23:53] they hit for me anyway if he knows ever
[23:57] not that ever bad it's I and he knows
[24:00] every person ever live in the world well
[24:02] you know what he's busy before the world
[24:05] he wasn't you sitting around he got in
[24:08] order to do I don't know what to think
[24:10] about you no longer know he had a lot to
[24:14] think about
[24:15] he said well he just thought about like
[24:17] well it may be true but what if he
[24:20] enjoyed his college what if he
[24:22] fellowship with that point of thinking
[24:25] oh maybe we'll get to it in a minute
[24:28] where the
[24:29] that Jesus told him he had fellowship
[24:31] with him before the world but yet not
[24:35] his pre-existence we don't believe in
[24:39] pre existence and souls they don't
[24:42] believe in pre existence of spirit but I
[24:44] firmly believe in pre existence yes of
[24:46] eternal life I believe in that so when
[24:51] the prophet said we always was eternal
[24:53] he's certainly not talking about our
[24:55] physical anatomy of body spirit and soul
[24:59] in the basis of the human that we are so
[25:02] why would you need a redeemer if it was
[25:05] anyway all right so then we know that he
[25:08] knows everything all right and knowing
[25:12] everything
[25:13] then let's don't limit him to bring in
[25:18] him I'm trying to make him real to you
[25:21] but not limiting him to me the greater
[25:25] the more he unveils of himself the
[25:28] greater God gets to me no that's the way
[25:32] I think the more I can see that he has
[25:34] unveiled on through and brought it out
[25:37] to being like it is that makes me more
[25:40] knowledgeable of how really is and how
[25:44] much greater that it can continue on to
[25:46] be that even the Prophet would say that
[25:49] after this world will receive a message
[25:51] you cheer down through the endless ages
[25:53] it's not going to be setting up in
[25:55] heaven well well God before the world
[25:57] was like this so now we're like this you
[25:59] know it setting around no it's going to
[26:01] be a wonderful time I had a brother know
[26:08] that I'm sorry I always hated for him to
[26:12] tell something you know even though I
[26:17] might enjoy what he was telling me but
[26:20] it was the way he told it your life and
[26:26] someone because you probably know what
[26:27] I'm talking about on that he would tell
[26:30] you he got up that morning ate breakfast
[26:32] had three eggs two Bacon's and biscuit
[26:34] and then he'd do and then after a while
[26:37] he finally get in the car in his story
[26:40] see he'd be telling you the whole day
[26:43] would finally get in his car at nine
[26:45] o'clock and he'd drive 15 miles to games
[26:47] was a cat cross the road and had to
[26:49] watch the hitch we had to do he told
[26:50] everything and then he finally got to
[26:52] the doctor's office at 10 o'clock and
[26:55] then the doctor came in to the nurse
[26:56] came first you understand what I mean
[26:59] you ain't never been around nobody like
[27:01] that you want to push flight forward
[27:06] right come on come on now speed it up
[27:09] with a little bit better I don't think
[27:14] God was that I don't think we'd get
[27:16] bored with listening to God explain a
[27:18] lot of things to you I don't think we
[27:20] will in the life I love to hear
[27:22] testimonies I love to read you some of
[27:25] you write me letters and things you know
[27:27] and tell me your testimonies of
[27:29] different things I enjoy reading them
[27:31] and I enjoy hearing your testimony of
[27:35] your life and what God means to you
[27:39] because that's part that's something
[27:41] that's that's a part of the mind and I
[27:43] enjoy all right now but get older
[27:46] thinking about it now the God we're
[27:50] talking about dwelt alone with his
[27:52] attributes those attributes he desired
[27:55] to be a savior he desired to be a healer
[27:57] he decided to be God he desired to be
[28:00] father he desired to be all of those
[28:02] things but none of those things were
[28:05] displayed so it would not bring him into
[28:08] a materialistic way in thinking it would
[28:12] be just him thinking in his mind now to
[28:16] illustrate that we're going to maybe not
[28:18] today but we will eventually see you've
[28:22] got to deal with a creation of a
[28:26] beginning and things in more than just
[28:29] to think something begin this that
[28:31] you've got to deal with it in the basis
[28:35] of see brethren said the first time God
[28:39] created was angels okay then we got
[28:45] quote now what about the quote where he
[28:48] said the first thing was God himself
[28:50] first creation was God inside
[28:57] what are you getting at I'm getting at
[29:00] there's two separate creations we will
[29:03] eventually cover one of them is literal
[29:05] things are something to more tangible
[29:09] whereas this other part is God unfolding
[29:12] himself as he comes down all right and
[29:17] then that way just don't get them
[29:19] crossed over and try to figure out what
[29:20] this has got to happen before this
[29:21] happens just remember what we're saying
[29:26] in his first physical or part creation
[29:31] that does not deal with his own nature
[29:34] doorways is that much as angels they
[29:41] worship it made him God okay but see
[29:45] then God Himself condescending into
[29:48] creation and bringing you and I into
[29:50] being it will bring you to a position of
[29:54] seeing eternity because the angels are
[29:57] not eternal the world is not eternal as
[30:04] we said the other day everything God
[30:06] ever thought it was not necessarily
[30:08] eternal well he thought of a lot of
[30:13] things this world is not eternal he
[30:15] thought of all of the time it's not
[30:16] eternal but then his thoughts of you and
[30:20] I are eternal we just remember one thing
[30:23] the thought he had of this world even
[30:27] though it's not eternal he can never add
[30:30] one thought to that because his thought
[30:34] is eternal it's just what he thought of
[30:37] is not eternal so he thought of angels
[30:39] they're not eternal so you can see a
[30:42] creation as it begins to come into being
[30:45] in the world and people and then but
[30:48] then you can see over on the other side
[30:50] to follow the line of God of
[30:52] understanding right now keep that in
[30:56] your thoughts let it run around and
[30:59] around in your head
[31:01] alright you are an attribute of your
[31:05] father because you're part of your
[31:07] father
[31:08] all right now your mind as it's working
[31:14] your mind you think of your children and
[31:18] you even think of children before they
[31:21] come you thought you named your babies
[31:22] right I mean you come in and say what's
[31:25] the baby will you know I don't like this
[31:27] new modern age where you know all about
[31:29] the baby how big it's going to be and
[31:31] everything else I enjoyed the fact of it
[31:33] waiting to the guy here and then come
[31:35] out and droves it
[31:36] I liked it anyway I don't like this well
[31:38] they're going to be this and going to be
[31:39] that you might be like there were people
[31:41] over in Banks County one day that they
[31:43] set them all up in the family and it was
[31:45] all going to be a girl or something and
[31:47] you know what you want them had a boy I
[31:51] just dread awaked okay but listen you
[31:56] dwell with your thoughts is I always say
[32:07] you're setting that right now some are
[32:09] saying well we got to do this when we
[32:11] get home we got to do that leave it on
[32:12] or wash your clothes they're going to do
[32:13] this
[32:14] the kids are going to do that your
[32:19] fellowshiping with your ethology and
[32:24] when I'm sitting there I do the same
[32:26] thing so I'm not blaming you okay I'm
[32:28] just being honest so you're not honest
[32:31] with me and said no I don't do that
[32:33] brother Jeffries one time he told me he
[32:36] learned how to fix the tractor and think
[32:37] it would while I was preaching I said
[32:39] well it must have been a great sermon
[32:43] but now listen God dwelt alone with his
[32:47] stalks and then a word as a thought
[32:52] expressed its first a thought then it's
[32:57] a word you remember that we kept trying
[33:00] to bring it out see my point is God was
[33:04] not just sitting back wherever you want
[33:06] to make him whatever I say just used the
[33:09] word heaven before the foundation of the
[33:12] world God wasn't sitting just back in
[33:14] heaven and cuddling and not nothing to
[33:17] do no it was a very busy person
[33:21] because he was planning everything I
[33:26] don't mean that he started to plan it
[33:29] this way no that won't work
[33:31] yeah this will work so we leave that one
[33:33] out of it no no his thoughts are eternal
[33:36] he didn't do this but he knew that's the
[33:40] way I love the Word of God you ain't
[33:41] never you ain't never stood in the with
[33:44] a word maybe to the point that you knew
[33:48] that that person you're talking to had
[33:52] no way to answer what you just said
[34:00] because he trapped their own selves you
[34:03] had never thought it out like that as
[34:06] you present it you know you know what I
[34:11] do a lot of times when I'm talking to
[34:12] people I'm listening to tapes you you
[34:19] know what I mean I'm listening to the
[34:23] way brother branham explained that I'm
[34:28] thinking over how he explained so-and-so
[34:31] and Jones or the Trinity or the one God
[34:33] is I'm thinking about that you know come
[34:38] to find out it gives you a lot of good
[34:40] answers because it worked back tyre to
[34:42] work now all right so then we we do
[34:45] dwell with our own thoughts our thoughts
[34:47] are wonderful it's not daydreaming
[34:55] you know daydreaming is you don't have
[34:58] nothing to do daydreaming no I enjoy
[35:02] thinking about brother let's see brother
[35:05] Quinn because right where the Queen was
[35:08] at the house one time and we were all
[35:10] sitting around there and all the kids
[35:12] get together and they get to picking on
[35:14] each other and telling things that
[35:16] happened you know or something you know
[35:18] that one of them done or this one done
[35:20] or whatever you know you know you know
[35:23] you just get a good life and when you
[35:26] look at Zack you know he's always been
[35:28] he wanted a little bit sorry
[35:29] chunky news for a good little boy well
[35:32] Hannah and Josh and
[35:35] and Matthew they would pick on him and I
[35:39] just pick on him and they pick on him
[35:41] and he kicked out boomer won't know well
[35:46] you know what would happen after a while
[35:47] you hear guys and Here Come three kids
[35:52] running through the house and here comes
[35:54] act with a ball that during any of them
[35:57] to slow down even though here's a whole
[36:00] lot smaller well see you can do that you
[36:03] can think about think about your life
[36:04] and were you being anything about that
[36:07] deer up there and Kansas when you seen
[36:09] it coming down as well with your
[36:14] thoughts we'll see that's the way card
[36:17] doulas only his thoughts is about you
[36:21] and I he's not thinking about his salary
[36:24] thinking about you even though okay he's
[36:27] thinking about what he will do when time
[36:31] came for him to do it is that about as
[36:35] good a statement you can make the guard
[36:37] before the world was sitting thinking of
[36:39] what he would do before a time came that
[36:42] he could do it that's a wonderful talk
[36:46] come see he had that in his mind and in
[36:50] his mind he knew what a wonderful God we
[36:55] serve that had in his mind what all of
[36:59] this would be about and you're not gonna
[37:01] change his mind that was what was so
[37:05] much this morning right I'm guarding I
[37:07] changed not he's nothing he's not gonna
[37:09] change his mind to fit me in you you
[37:11] said well in the Bible's our this guy
[37:12] asked fifteen years and got it ain't
[37:14] here he's gonna give it to him forever
[37:16] when the world ever started so he didn't
[37:18] change his mind it just looks like to
[37:23] mankind he didn't know he changed
[37:24] nothing honey so he wasn't alone as we
[37:29] think as he dwelled with his thoughts he
[37:35] was dwelling with his star
[37:37] how real is that how real is it for you
[37:42] to dwell with your thoughts
[37:46] I Creighton wonderful it is should we do
[37:53] that when we think about the things that
[37:55] you and I would be thinking of and then
[38:00] we speak it it's not just for that and
[38:05] you know fanaticism zand and ideas and
[38:09] all like that but see what we're talking
[38:11] about now is that in heaven whatever you
[38:17] want to call the place you can go that
[38:21] there was many things taking place in
[38:24] God's mind that he recorded in the word
[38:36] that was taking place back there about
[38:43] that one he recorded in the word that it
[38:50] was going to take place because in his
[38:54] mind it was already taking place it just
[38:59] hadn't come into reality yet what a
[39:05] better wonderful card what about a
[39:08] savior and God I told them we wouldn't
[39:13] if I call for now full of quotes and
[39:16] things but if not we'll just go with
[39:18] some thoughts Matthew 13 and 35 says
[39:24] that it might be fulfilled which was
[39:25] spoken by the prophets saying I'll open
[39:28] my mouth in parables I will utter things
[39:31] which have been kept secret from the
[39:35] foundation of the world who got new
[39:40] secrets that had been kept secret of
[39:42] what unless in the world Matthew 25:34
[39:47] then shall the King say unto them on the
[39:50] right hand come you blessed of my father
[39:52] inherit the kingdom prepared for you
[39:55] from the foundation
[39:59] of the world old things are already
[40:04] pre-prepared
[40:06] not in order yeah but that makes God
[40:09] just stamping it out so you're not
[40:11] listening
[40:13] cannot list me John 17 and 24 Father I
[40:21] will that they also whom thou hast given
[40:24] me be with me where I am that they may
[40:30] behold my glory which thou has given me
[40:35] for thou lovest me before the foundation
[40:44] of the world a lot of things going on
[40:50] before the foundation the world
[40:53] what about Ephesians 1 and 4 according
[41:00] as he had chosen us in him before the
[41:04] foundation of the world that we should
[41:07] be holy and without blame before him in
[41:11] love who quote in a minute where the
[41:16] Prophet was saying that Jesus has
[41:19] evidently the John which is really where
[41:21] Jesus told her disciples said I had a
[41:24] you with me in the beginning we had a
[41:26] wonderful time if you'll take right what
[41:29] we've read just above there you have it
[41:32] with the glory that he had before the
[41:35] foundation of the world
[41:36] what about Hebrews four and three said
[41:40] we have believed that by entering into
[41:42] life although the works were finished
[41:46] see if they shall enter into my rest
[41:49] although the works were finished from
[41:52] the foundation of the world yes it even
[41:58] started this already over
[42:08] what about first Peter 1 in 20 Hoover Li
[42:11] was foreordained before the foundation
[42:15] of the world but was manifest in these
[42:19] last times for you he was fully for
[42:26] ordained before the world for less there
[42:33] was a lot going on before the foundation
[42:35] of the world before there was anything
[42:37] that had been created of any form where
[42:41] God was dwelling alone that's the point
[42:43] I'm trying to get you to see get you to
[42:47] see a reality of what was taking place
[42:50] before that you even think about a world
[42:54] you see what does that what do we need
[42:56] that far I don't know you just could it
[42:59] all could I really enjoy I enjoy the
[43:02] fact of thinking about some things
[43:04] before the world you know what I might
[43:08] just be part of it I saritha enjoyed I
[43:12] have a good time thinking about it and
[43:17] if I don't believe it was me before the
[43:19] foundation world Who am I going to
[43:20] believe it wise now think about it we're
[43:30] going to cover if we get time three
[43:34] basic lineups of the scriptures 3 like
[43:38] scriptural point and each one of these
[43:42] points we're going to be talking about
[43:46] something taken place in glory before
[43:50] the world ever begun and surely if the
[43:55] Bible said in the mouth of two or three
[43:56] witnesses let everything be established
[43:58] so then if we can look back before the
[44:03] world what I don't know whatever I won't
[44:06] know what's happening now you're not
[44:13] listening what's happening now was
[44:16] thought of before we got here this is
[44:19] the fulfillment of the thoughts
[44:23] when we get down to the little scripture
[44:25] in a minute see it might be right where
[44:28] you're sitting right now what you're
[44:33] doing right now might be the very thing
[44:36] that got in his mind I believe it is I
[44:38] mean I'm not saying might be I'm just
[44:40] putting that point to you surely if we
[44:44] believe anything at all or to know that
[44:46] God by foreknowledge would know ever
[44:48] every person would be sitting here today
[44:50] I never thought you're having and what
[44:53] you're done a night you got ready to
[44:55] come and how you done there's me done
[44:56] that surely we would think that God is
[44:59] infinite is after the word that he would
[45:02] know all of those things within you know
[45:06] what he just might get away from and we
[45:11] might get away from thinking so much
[45:12] about that and come to find out this is
[45:14] what God saw and if this is what he saw
[45:20] it might be excuses the controlling
[45:26] factors right here
[45:35] are you going to think maybe tomorrow
[45:36] I'm going to be this and when I get to
[45:38] that I'll do I talk we believe the Bible
[45:45] what does the Bible say about salvation
[45:48] it says today is the day of salvation
[45:54] it doesn't say yesterday or tomorrow it
[45:58] says today is the day of salvation
[45:59] that's why I've always tried to get us
[46:02] to see anybody in the Bible
[46:04] you remember this few weeks ago anybody
[46:06] in the Bible ever amounted to anything
[46:07] whatsoever was somebody by faith that
[46:10] realized what God was doing right then
[46:13] right then not doing later or what he
[46:20] had done so that's what we want to do we
[46:21] want to look back and see what God done
[46:23] for somebody else we want to look
[46:26] forward and see what God will do for
[46:27] somebody else and failing to see what
[46:29] he's doing for us right now you might
[46:35] find out this it was more important than
[46:37] we think that we're just thinking with
[46:40] it you know we need to know about the
[46:42] Lord well how much more do you need to
[46:43] know about the Lord now it simply means
[46:50] you want a sugar to a doctor and you're
[46:52] wanting something that doesn't take
[46:53] thinking about to where that can cut you
[46:55] can comprehend it you're wanting
[46:58] something that's a baby form instead of
[47:00] wanting to grow up in Christ but 100 I
[47:07] mean we've been around here 50 years you
[47:10] can play around and keep 50 more coming
[47:14] up at years into profit look why do you
[47:19] think we've been here 50 years don't you
[47:22] think he knows
[47:25] you see I don't blush that on people
[47:28] because it don't do any good they're
[47:31] going to help nothing anyway you know
[47:33] what I should have said in 1974 when I
[47:36] stood in this pulpit and said according
[47:38] to the Bible in the prophets message we
[47:40] could pass the Year 2026 and not break
[47:44] the Bible nor the prophets message I
[47:46] should have said that's thus saith the
[47:48] Lord
[47:48] you don't believe it you're the ones got
[47:50] to deal with it I'm not that hateful but
[47:52] you know what we're getting close you
[47:55] know what are your dates and times that
[47:58] you've had before
[47:59] has gone off the scene I don't want to
[48:02] be that form of something to try to dry
[48:04] something I want you to believe you know
[48:08] when the end of the world is going to
[48:09] come when you and I come to the place
[48:12] that in God's mind he knew where we
[48:14] would be I just can't see it as real as
[48:24] you do brother there will I come
[48:28] what aren't you talking about an eternal
[48:30] God I come what's the part what's the
[48:34] problem
[48:37] but Randleman talking about the Lamb's
[48:39] Book of Life before the foundation of
[48:42] the world said when the lamb was slain
[48:44] every person that was ever to be saved
[48:49] was associated with the lamb in the
[48:56] sleigh before the foundation of the
[49:00] world
[49:04] estimation surge we would see Jesus in
[49:06] 1957 what about that ever person and we
[49:15] can bring it to the books on that so he
[49:18] won't get confused and think about it
[49:20] you know that even the person who
[49:23] receives eternal life he's connected
[49:26] into the book of life because there's a
[49:28] section there that he can be in and even
[49:34] to be given eternal life so the whole
[49:36] thing is associated with Jesus Christ
[49:38] Jesus Christ paid the price for
[49:40] everybody in the Old Testament right is
[49:42] what was the New Testament for everybody
[49:45] that would ever receive eternal life it
[49:48] is an association with him how much more
[49:52] is it with his family his offspring his
[49:55] children
[50:00] how much greater is it for that who do
[50:08] you understand then like we gave the
[50:09] scriptures of all dealing with before
[50:11] the foundation of the world the Prophet
[50:17] said on the message the baptism of the
[50:18] Holy Spirit he's talking about when
[50:21] Christ was slain
[50:22] he said when was the lamb slain he said
[50:26] two thousand years ago and he saw he
[50:29] said maybe a hundred million years ago
[50:34] before the foundation of the world was
[50:37] ever formed Jesus Christ died for our
[50:39] sins
[50:41] well now how I give religious when was
[50:48] the Lamb's Book of Life to that cause
[50:50] really technically doesn't say louse
[50:52] book of life
[50:53] it says the book of the lamb slain we
[50:56] use it and to say the book of life you
[50:58] know the book of the lamb slain it all
[51:01] right but when was it written before the
[51:06] foundation of world
[51:07] well all right we've got a couple of
[51:09] million years from the right names and
[51:14] many people have been in the world since
[51:15] the beginning it's seven billion now how
[51:18] many people have been in the world a
[51:22] seven billion right now how many been in
[51:24] the world and he's been in the world
[51:26] before the flood and he's bending all of
[51:28] the honey how many billions of names are
[51:31] they they heard you're playing dumb I
[51:37] agree with here because my Bible said
[51:40] the name was written before the
[51:44] foundation of world and what how was it
[51:47] written well he took me any brother how
[51:53] was it written I thought that it was a
[52:00] book of names and I thought it was
[52:03] written in the blood of Jesus Christ
[52:07] am i right
[52:09] I mean is it true the night that the
[52:12] Lamb's Book of Life section is the
[52:14] eternal sack written in the blood of
[52:16] Jesus Christ
[52:17] yeah but he had even died yet does that
[52:21] have anything to do with it it would
[52:26] eventually come to where he would but
[52:30] does that have anything to do with what
[52:32] I'm talking about
[52:33] the God before the world look how long
[52:34] it would take him to right everybody's
[52:36] name I'm trying to get you to see God as
[52:40] real and if before the world ever begun
[52:42] any thoughts that he's more real there's
[52:45] more real bad it is here that he's
[52:47] riding with riding names well I just
[52:54] don't think he danowitz well what was he
[52:56] doing well I think he was writing names
[53:02] well he ain't no book well Brett around
[53:05] said there was a book and said it went
[53:06] back I'm quoting him he said turn the
[53:13] garden when senator the picture he said
[53:15] the book back I went back said he
[53:17] couldn't go to the hands of the devil
[53:18] said he went to God who gave it
[53:21] he must have had a book oh we look at
[53:25] this we look at it and Bible that's fine
[53:27] to look at it as a Bible because it's
[53:29] Bible is a book it's a book of names
[53:33] Loretta said now wait a minute he said
[53:36] now Armand Neville might not be written
[53:37] enough he said was written in their
[53:39] world island during our time armored
[53:40] nibbled on earth with our bodies that
[53:42] are man Devils written in the book you
[53:45] don't think about that in your name what
[53:50] I'm so glad about is to find out right
[53:52] around them taught us what if it might
[53:54] not be Danny found might not be James
[54:00] Colley he said it would be the name that
[54:06] was written before the foundation of the
[54:10] world
[54:15] we talk about a new name maybe it'd be
[54:17] good to find out whether our name is
[54:19] earned on and if it is it might not be
[54:21] our name physically Samuel Dale right
[54:24] now I'm trying to get you to see the
[54:27] reality of a living God how real he
[54:29] really is how long would it take him to
[54:33] write a book of all the names then he's
[54:37] got books to write after then because
[54:40] remember the Bible was written before
[54:42] the founders were all right that's in
[54:45] God's mind it was no physical writing it
[54:52] took quite a while for the hand write
[54:53] the Bible right
[54:57] remember that the books that's a record
[55:01] that God wanted to keep all right so
[55:06] when was the lamb slain 2,000 years ago
[55:09] no millions of years ago in God's mind
[55:14] the lamb was flying though something's
[55:19] going on don't was taking place in
[55:25] heaven
[55:31] then why did God the infinite God ever
[55:34] permits in the Prophet said in what he
[55:41] said
[55:42] little words were you and I could come
[55:46] he permitted the devil to come into
[55:49] being you didn't make him the devil he
[55:52] permitted him to come into being knowing
[55:54] he would be used to running the fall and
[55:56] knowing the fall would bring up I said
[55:58] he could be a healer he could be a
[56:00] savior he could be a redeemer he could
[56:04] be fathered by natural physical creation
[56:06] where I create without you know sin he
[56:10] could be a god because the Angels would
[56:13] worship Him and the word God but he
[56:15] couldn't be healer Savior thing so it
[56:18] allows the devil to come into being so
[56:24] it could be brought to Pais what that
[56:27] did he had it in mind that wouldn't pull
[56:31] an over on him poor old fella you said I
[56:37] just hate that devil too bad I don't
[56:38] hate it
[56:40] or don't know and realize he'll never be
[56:42] saved you mean you're wanting somebody
[56:48] to not be safe why would you be that way
[56:52] I'd like to be able to see him safe but
[56:55] they were warned why because he was that
[57:10] in the beginning before the foundation
[57:12] of the world we see the Bible telling us
[57:18] according to Revelation 13:8 that
[57:22] something was taking place before the
[57:26] world ever begun that he was writing the
[57:29] book of life of the lamb slain from the
[57:32] foundation of the world he said what I
[57:41] did I can't see it because all I think
[57:44] about is it's just not him doing
[57:49] something no you realize everything he
[57:57] thought of dollars gonna take place on
[57:58] earth if he thought of it taking place
[58:01] here you see why do I care about getting
[58:05] to be present in was it matter to me if
[58:12] they put to Hill or busy I told you that
[58:15] when they started doing I said I wish
[58:17] they'd put palin and hilary both of men
[58:20] remember that back hunter would see
[58:24] everybody but window when the woman gets
[58:26] in the white house then we'll be ready
[58:28] to go well what the prophet said back
[58:31] there you ought to listen to he said
[58:33] it's all ready to hire let's see we
[58:38] don't want to add we want it's got to be
[58:39] a set time well when this takes place
[58:41] we'll be ready then oh we're okay until
[58:43] the woman gets in the white house well
[58:45] that's really good ain't it are we going
[58:48] to do set around twiddle our thumbs and
[58:49] wait on the bush to pull up until the
[58:52] woman gets in the white house yeah a
[58:55] Russia comes after all see we're
[59:02] limiting God to a situation that we need
[59:04] to get away from the prophet of God
[59:10] talks about his name and how that his
[59:13] name not only Christ was slain to take
[59:17] away sin but your name was written in
[59:19] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[59:21] foundation of the world
[59:23] God wrote your name associated with his
[59:30] so that's not Samuel do you remember the
[59:37] Bible speaks up we were on it the other
[59:39] way you've got a name that nobody knows
[59:41] but themselves you can't tell nobody you
[59:45] can't tell nobody on you now which I can
[59:51] Paul I'm kinda handsome but remember
[59:54] it's associating with him remember we
[59:58] read you scripture what that we were
[1:00:01] chosen in him when when was we chosen I
[1:00:04] accepted Jesus Christ an altar that was
[1:00:07] wonderful I was when it was transmitted
[1:00:09] down here but in God's mind where did it
[1:00:11] come from in God's mind you just as
[1:00:13] eternal if God is
[1:00:15] if you ever will be eternal but if you
[1:00:19] never will be eternal they don't worry
[1:00:20] about you're not going to get it anyway
[1:00:23] whatever to be associated with him
[1:00:27] because you were his attributes you
[1:00:31] don't remember it from the message who
[1:00:33] is this milk editing page 54 you don't
[1:00:37] remember it but because you're just a
[1:00:40] part you don't remember it no because
[1:00:44] you're just a part of his life you are a
[1:00:49] part of God when you become the son and
[1:00:51] daughter of God part of his life what
[1:00:56] was back before the foundation of the
[1:00:58] world and the writing sure they would
[1:01:00] have to be a thought of a record of all
[1:01:02] the world and what would take place
[1:01:03] which original one that was written was
[1:01:06] written in the Lamb's Book of Life or
[1:01:08] the book of the life of the lamb slain
[1:01:09] before the foundation of the world so
[1:01:14] you got that going on in heaven do you
[1:01:15] realize what I'm getting at it took four
[1:01:18] thousand years it took four thousand
[1:01:23] years to bring into being Christ dying
[1:01:28] on the cross but are you with the
[1:01:33] prophet of what he would saying he said
[1:01:35] when he died
[1:01:36] God's mind before the world he said it
[1:01:38] was the same as any reality you would
[1:01:40] ever think of
[1:01:44] he said it's already settled and
[1:01:46] complete it wasn't going to get for
[1:01:49] nails to hold him to across and we'd say
[1:01:51] they put three why because they said it
[1:01:54] would be three what about the things
[1:01:57] that are written in the Bible that we
[1:01:59] can depend on and realize that things
[1:02:00] will happen what about the Bible we
[1:02:04] talked about those things when the Bible
[1:02:06] was talking about that the wind the
[1:02:08] Towers fall the light of the Sun would
[1:02:13] be as the light of the Moon and the
[1:02:16] light of the other one of them is seven
[1:02:18] times four we looked right in the word
[1:02:22] and there's the towers followed what
[1:02:29] about in the Bible when they found the
[1:02:30] scroll and they stood before the water
[1:02:34] gate I'm quoting scripture and read the
[1:02:38] scroll kind of an odd statement of how
[1:02:42] that the Word of God came into being
[1:02:44] through the mouth of a prophet before
[1:02:46] Watergate came into being in the life
[1:02:48] stage we wanted to relate something like
[1:02:51] that because it tantalizes our thoughts
[1:02:53] it makes us think when Russia comes
[1:02:56] after all so we just watch Russia until
[1:03:00] they start moving at all we might we're
[1:03:01] wrong
[1:03:07] that's not the way God is saying it
[1:03:11] [Music]
[1:03:16] listen to what he said on as long as our
[1:03:18] decent church age it was God's purpose
[1:03:21] to bring forth of people like unto
[1:03:23] himself that would be a word bride she
[1:03:29] was chosen before the foundation of the
[1:03:32] world in him she was for known and
[1:03:38] beloved before she was ever brought
[1:03:41] forth during the ages upon the earth
[1:03:44] she was redeemed by his blood and can
[1:03:49] never come into condemnation before the
[1:03:52] world it would brother Dale what I'm
[1:03:58] getting the idea of you now you know I'm
[1:04:00] getting the ideas that you're trying to
[1:04:02] make things going back that away more
[1:04:04] real than what we are now well you're
[1:04:06] getting it just right I'm glad you
[1:04:08] thought of that I'm glad you finally
[1:04:10] thought of that idea because that's
[1:04:12] exactly what I'm talking about
[1:04:16] you showed that was just in his mind
[1:04:18] within in his mind is more real than
[1:04:20] anything we could ever think of
[1:04:22] right you saw every member I'll show you
[1:04:31] what Ron said even the color you're
[1:04:33] higher was dark
[1:04:37] her before the foundation of the world
[1:04:40] written in the book of the life of the
[1:04:42] lamb slain he knew every wound
[1:04:47] everything he's Mike oops I'm sorry just
[1:04:55] be human but he knew all it would take
[1:04:59] place upon there we're just now I'm
[1:05:05] being fulfilled in that probably said
[1:05:10] when did he die he said we say he died
[1:05:11] sometimes here he said he died millions
[1:05:14] of years before the foundational world
[1:05:18] he's old that was just in his mind are
[1:05:24] you gonna tell me your mind is greater
[1:05:26] than his mind
[1:05:28] are you going to tell me you and my
[1:05:31] peanut brain is going to outtake an
[1:05:33] eternal God that knows why never thought
[1:05:37] you would ever think while we thinking
[1:05:39] he knows it the better reality of a
[1:05:46] living God like that because they asked
[1:05:51] him the question questions and answers
[1:05:58] 59 where we spirits might die he said no
[1:06:06] that we wouldn't nothing he goes on down
[1:06:09] to the bottom and said we're only
[1:06:10] figuratively in his mind he said we were
[1:06:13] in his mind oh wait I just believed I
[1:06:16] was back you see him in the message you
[1:06:18] know I remember Napoleon you know
[1:06:20] Bonaparte Napoleon got you know he kind
[1:06:24] of believed it was sometime well we like
[1:06:26] that I just feel like I was back there I
[1:06:28] just feel that I was before the world
[1:06:30] feel what sorry to be the blunt give me
[1:06:37] a piece of ice I'll bring you some
[1:06:38] feelings he says that's silly another
[1:06:43] statement but it's truth didn't it what
[1:06:47] his feelings got to do with it when the
[1:06:48] Word of God says it the Word of God said
[1:06:51] he died before the foundation of the
[1:06:54] world why the Bible said we were chosen
[1:06:56] in him before the foundation of the
[1:06:59] world so it's not whether or not I'm
[1:07:01] chosen it's whether or not he was chosen
[1:07:07] right I'm not depending on my goodness
[1:07:10] to make me chosen I'm depending on the
[1:07:16] fact of what he said did I believe it
[1:07:23] who's chosen in him
[1:07:29] he said we're just one of these
[1:07:31] attributes he knows what your name would
[1:07:33] be he knowed the color of your fire you
[1:07:38] would have he knowed all about you
[1:07:40] only thing happen is in when you was a
[1:07:43] sinner you turned back from it so before
[1:07:47] the foundation of the world and you
[1:07:51] would be there he knew you by name and
[1:07:57] so this is carry him by name before the
[1:08:00] foundation of the world he said think of
[1:08:02] it many times we sing that song a new
[1:08:05] name written down in glory you know the
[1:08:08] song you know there's a new name written
[1:08:09] down in glory he said let's see if this
[1:08:12] is the one I've got one where he said to
[1:08:21] take when they wrote that he said no
[1:08:22] doubt singing that song
[1:08:26] listen to brendham no doubt singing that
[1:08:29] song when you name was written down in
[1:08:30] glory he said a lot of people got
[1:08:32] converted you need that now I'll find it
[1:08:36] I thought it was right dark house you're
[1:08:38] fine he said good it ain't true and he
[1:08:44] said people would get converted them
[1:08:46] singing that song but it's not true he
[1:08:49] said it was written before the
[1:08:50] foundation the world that's how real he
[1:08:54] could be about it thoughts of what we
[1:09:00] could be weary spirits we were not even
[1:09:04] nothing questions and answers in 59 only
[1:09:12] figuratively in his mind so if we wasn't
[1:09:16] spirits back there we surely ain't going
[1:09:18] to be placed back there are we I don't
[1:09:22] mean to tell it in sarcastic ways or two
[1:09:24] but we were talking one time about and
[1:09:27] sitting in our house and I remember it
[1:09:28] and this sister just heard a little bit
[1:09:32] about the messaging and her husband and
[1:09:35] they were there talking and it was
[1:09:37] brought up about how that we were going
[1:09:39] to get a new body you know this this
[1:09:41] body would be redeemed
[1:09:42] and I'm honest to think I'm sorry I'm
[1:09:47] human she said you mean we're gonna get
[1:09:50] a new body we explained you know not new
[1:09:56] like we thank you but this body read it
[1:09:59] and she said well I'd hate you to put
[1:10:05] out her thoughts right about that time
[1:10:06] because I kind of believe her thoughts
[1:10:08] is in the line that she was thinking
[1:10:10] about this is gonna giving you and I
[1:10:12] ain't gonna be little like I am
[1:10:14] now so irate but human that make you
[1:10:19] think it's not silly talk it's a reality
[1:10:27] of a living God and how eternal his
[1:10:30] thoughts are and how that he saw before
[1:10:35] the world ever begun what it would take
[1:10:40] place what we would be alright
[1:10:44] our scripture number one scripture
[1:10:49] number one we've covered the book of
[1:10:51] life over the life of the land before
[1:10:53] the world all names were written before
[1:10:57] the world
[1:10:58] God knew all it would ever be saved and
[1:10:59] all that ever be lost
[1:11:01] he knew all of that in his mind in the
[1:11:04] only way we was back tyre was not just
[1:11:06] be standing with him we were in him
[1:11:10] there's the difference and when we get
[1:11:13] down in the little while because see
[1:11:15] everybody wants to be into my if I was
[1:11:17] just in the mind of God or with
[1:11:20] something if I just I said then the same
[1:11:22] thing I say now I don't want to be in
[1:11:25] the mind of God because Judas Iscariot
[1:11:26] was in the mind of God and walked with
[1:11:30] the Lord Jesus and had signs and wonders
[1:11:34] falling in annointed I don't want to be
[1:11:42] in God's mind I want to be a part of
[1:11:45] God's mind I want to go back Pais just
[1:11:48] something he taught us so I'm not
[1:11:50] talking about you something he thought
[1:11:53] of
[1:11:54] I want us to think about going all the
[1:11:58] way back into his very mind the Bible
[1:12:00] said let the mind that was in Christ
[1:12:02] being you it will make you a new
[1:12:04] creature right I thought it'd be great
[1:12:13] to be in his mind well what if he
[1:12:15] thought about you being lost remember
[1:12:19] this one way or the other maybe what you
[1:12:24] want to say in his mind it was one way
[1:12:26] or the other and he'll never change it
[1:12:30] why don't you just try to be part of the
[1:12:32] mind so now here's the story's gonna
[1:12:36] have to catch and hold onto remember
[1:12:40] when I said it wanted them creation the
[1:12:44] first creation was angels your prophet
[1:12:52] said catenin then the other quote is his
[1:12:55] first creation was God himself two lines
[1:13:03] of creation there's no story to the end
[1:13:09] of what you're talking about
[1:13:10] so don't even get it any mind just
[1:13:13] remember you turn a life it's a part of
[1:13:19] God you agree if the fact is it's easy
[1:13:23] on the one s eternal she's in the only
[1:13:25] way you can have eternal life or have
[1:13:26] his own life in you the only way we can
[1:13:28] be eternal was to be a part of God in
[1:13:30] the beginning not something he thought
[1:13:33] of if he thought of it he's got to give
[1:13:35] us eternal life so then you couldn't be
[1:13:38] before the foundation world when he
[1:13:40] thought of me when I'd come to earth him
[1:13:42] and receive the new part amen
[1:13:46] but remember in his mind you already had
[1:13:50] it that's why if you'd read it and take
[1:13:54] the message anyway folks predestination
[1:13:56] is a very simple message predestination
[1:14:00] is very simple the Bible tells you how
[1:14:03] simple it is
[1:14:05] which comes first read estimation or for
[1:14:11] knowledge the Bible tells you it says
[1:14:16] those who he foreknew he did
[1:14:21] predestinate so predestination will come
[1:14:26] first
[1:14:27] you know you don't deal with stuff like
[1:14:29] that to me but that's you don't think
[1:14:31] about the way I think see I want to know
[1:14:33] which one comfort just like God and
[1:14:35] attributes and time which comes first
[1:14:37] before it can be words but rather said
[1:14:40] it had to be a thought he said it had to
[1:14:43] be a thought for could be an attribute
[1:14:44] well which one first thought wheel into
[1:14:50] the murderer when it was okay you may
[1:14:54] not matter to you but it sure does to me
[1:14:58] okay so now let's go into thinking a
[1:15:04] little bit further recovered number one
[1:15:10] we covered revelations 13 8 let's read
[1:15:14] it a little scripture we will read this
[1:15:16] one brothers would be a number 12 let's
[1:15:21] read the scripture and see something
[1:15:24] that was taking place in heaven before
[1:15:29] the foundation of work what the Bible
[1:15:35] says
[1:15:36] well that's the title of the message too
[1:15:39] we're washed out there what he asked Joe
[1:15:45] when I laid the foundation of the world
[1:15:48] the klar if thou has to understand it
[1:15:53] now if you'll take this for the
[1:15:55] background out of it and show the whole
[1:15:56] point of it
[1:15:57] LeBron said the only thing God had
[1:15:59] against Joe so job was just a little bit
[1:16:01] self-righteous you study the message
[1:16:04] I'll be glad to show you he had to lift
[1:16:07] it up just to her so when he's lifted up
[1:16:09] just to her God says to him hey wait a
[1:16:11] minute oh boy
[1:16:13] you just got live to do it because you
[1:16:16] like it because all the guys come to you
[1:16:18] remember
[1:16:18] Joey don't read the Bible he enjoyed
[1:16:22] going to town because the young man and
[1:16:25] everybody come to him and listen to him
[1:16:28] because it's a little bit too raised up
[1:16:33] he slaps him down because he says where
[1:16:37] what style you think you got the answer
[1:16:40] to all these guys asking you questions
[1:16:41] he said let me ask you a question for
[1:16:44] what style when I laid the foundations
[1:16:48] there the choir has died to understand
[1:16:51] it who has laid the measures thereof if
[1:16:54] not knows or who has strength stretched
[1:16:58] the line upon it we're a poner the
[1:17:01] foundation dareth isand or who laid the
[1:17:07] cornerstone their hood when the morning
[1:17:12] stars sang together and all the sons of
[1:17:15] God shouted for joy
[1:17:18] Joe Borgia
[1:17:20] where were you at while the angels were
[1:17:23] shouting in the son's room I mean
[1:17:25] singing and the Son of God shouting for
[1:17:27] joy where was you at job he was just
[1:17:31] showing him that he could speak of the
[1:17:33] things but he was not a born-again
[1:17:35] believer so he could not enter therein
[1:17:37] to understand the full story
[1:17:40] after a while he catches at least soon
[1:17:42] and he said I know my Redeemer liveth he
[1:17:45] begin to catch on brother and said he
[1:17:47] told him said stand up Jobe begin to
[1:17:53] speak from the inner man and bring out a
[1:17:55] lot of great truths but he's asking him
[1:17:59] where we had okay number one revelation
[1:18:03] 13:8 covers the book of life of the lamb
[1:18:06] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:18:08] okay number two look what was happening
[1:18:12] in heaven
[1:18:18] what was this acted this was in heaven
[1:18:24] the morning stars were seen the sons of
[1:18:27] God shouted for joy in the morning stars
[1:18:33] are the angels okay is that we do I need
[1:18:35] to bring the quote the Angels I'll give
[1:18:40] you the quote words in here the Brethren
[1:18:41] said the Angels sang first in heaven
[1:18:46] before the foundation of the world when
[1:18:48] the morning started saying together and
[1:18:50] Sunda God shouted for joy and he said
[1:18:52] then they sang the second time when
[1:18:55] Jesus Christ come forth as a child what
[1:19:02] are the Angels what does the Bible speak
[1:19:04] of angels it says they're ministering
[1:19:08] spirits or what reason they're made to
[1:19:17] be helpers and I'm quoting in this
[1:19:20] office to hire v-club they're made to be
[1:19:25] helpers for those that are redeemed now
[1:19:29] quote brother Branham only the redeemed
[1:19:32] of angels we don't have all this stuff
[1:19:38] you know that you've got a baby over
[1:19:39] here you've got an angel hanging out
[1:19:41] over that's alright just make sure you
[1:19:44] don't have a female angel floating
[1:19:46] around because that's what they all want
[1:19:47] right
[1:19:48] cause ain't no female angels so that
[1:19:51] sells there but listen where was that
[1:19:57] when I laid the foundation of the world
[1:19:59] the choir if you can understand when the
[1:20:02] morning stars sang together in the sons
[1:20:04] of God shouted for joy where were you
[1:20:12] brother Branham you still serving that
[1:20:16] new religion he said nope I'm preaching
[1:20:23] the oldest religion that ever was he
[1:20:27] said I'm preaching about
[1:20:31] where was you when I laid the foundation
[1:20:34] of the world when the morning stars sang
[1:20:36] together in the sundar - God shouted for
[1:20:38] joy millions of years before the
[1:20:42] foundation of the world
[1:20:47] just put them brother I heard brother
[1:20:50] so-and-so bringing it out like that and
[1:20:52] he brought pre-existence well I'm not
[1:20:54] brother so-and-so okay so I'm not
[1:20:58] talking about pre-existence of nothing
[1:21:01] but eternal life not pre-existence of
[1:21:05] people or spirits or ideas or whatever
[1:21:07] no it's pre-existence of eternal life
[1:21:11] we've done established at the last book
[1:21:13] of the life of the lamb slain before the
[1:21:15] foundation world it's a book of the
[1:21:17] redeemed those with eternal life now
[1:21:21] we're looking back and seeing that while
[1:21:23] that was taking place the names were
[1:21:27] being written it's when job was shown
[1:21:31] the angel singing and the sons of God
[1:21:35] shouting for joy it's off the message
[1:21:42] witnesses off the message the serpent
[1:21:47] seed he's talking about and we're taught
[1:21:50] that in the Blessed word that we had
[1:21:53] fellowship with him before the
[1:21:55] foundation of the world when the morning
[1:21:57] stars sang together in the Son of God
[1:21:59] shouted for joy way back before the
[1:22:01] foundation of the world how do we know
[1:22:04] that that wasn't at the same time that
[1:22:09] the lamb was slain that when God in His
[1:22:14] great thinking seen those shouting and
[1:22:17] rejoicing in our salvation through Jesus
[1:22:26] but you you sound too much like
[1:22:30] pre-existence that's all you can do
[1:22:36] without taking my word part or what I
[1:22:38] always talk because this has been 40
[1:22:40] something years that I've been teaching
[1:22:41] this way it's great went into
[1:22:44] pre-existent yet I believe in pre
[1:22:47] existence of eternal life God is the
[1:22:51] only one that can pre-exists
[1:22:52] you and I don't pre exist unless we can
[1:22:57] find ourselves in him the Bible said
[1:23:01] being found in him having not our own
[1:23:05] righteousness
[1:23:15] let's read easing in will give at all
[1:23:17] also in paragraph a it was paragraph one
[1:23:20] pair of eighty to the serpent seat said
[1:23:22] when the morning stars saying together
[1:23:23] the sons of God shouted for joy who were
[1:23:26] those sons of God that were shouting for
[1:23:29] joy Jesus told them I had joy with you
[1:23:34] before the foundation of the world he
[1:23:38] told her disciples and he had joy with
[1:23:41] them with them before the foundation of
[1:23:44] the world were they devack then were
[1:23:50] they saved just because that was taken
[1:23:52] blood the rejected King it comes down to
[1:24:01] a long story but didn't think enough
[1:24:02] right down at the bottom it says he
[1:24:05] talking about what organization our
[1:24:06] religion the earlier he said that was
[1:24:09] only about two hundred years ago that
[1:24:12] organization listen but this
[1:24:15] organization started when the sons of
[1:24:19] when the morning stars saying together
[1:24:21] the sons of God shouted for joy when
[1:24:23] they seen the coming of a savior to
[1:24:26] redeem mankind this is taking place for
[1:24:33] the foundation of the world
[1:24:37] make sure getting busy back there if you
[1:24:40] understand what I'm eating a lot of
[1:24:42] things are taking place adoption 1960 no
[1:24:54] wonder when the morning stars saying to
[1:24:56] get in the sons of God shouted for joy
[1:24:57] when they seen the plan of salvation God
[1:25:01] putting your name on the book before the
[1:25:06] foundation of the world
[1:25:11] what about it
[1:25:13] I was back there with him if I've got
[1:25:19] eternal life spiritual amnesia 64 I was
[1:25:24] back there with him if I got eternal
[1:25:26] life was there with him
[1:25:28] I was identified with him when the
[1:25:32] morning stars sang together in the sons
[1:25:33] of God shouted for joy so what was back
[1:25:39] there if I have eternal life he said if
[1:25:43] you have eternal life right here today
[1:25:45] then that eternal life you have was in
[1:25:47] God before the foundation work because
[1:25:49] it's God's own life is that sensible
[1:25:53] about it well we're not a denomination
[1:26:00] he talked about the Morningstar Sangha
[1:26:02] he said they're my angels and everything
[1:26:05] was happy shouting about it before there
[1:26:09] was a foundation of the world how is the
[1:26:17] devil ever going to keep me in the dust
[1:26:21] of the earth they can't do it
[1:26:24] what am i dependent upon what about it
[1:26:34] the Prophet said that it was when they
[1:26:38] saw the plan of redemption they were
[1:26:45] shouting for joy we're getting into the
[1:26:50] third third scripture in just a second
[1:26:52] but remember where we're at we're back
[1:26:56] before the foundation of the world with
[1:26:57] scripture number two as the sons and
[1:26:59] daughters of God shouting for joy
[1:27:11] I thought we understood from the Bible
[1:27:13] that even the devil knew the plan of God
[1:27:18] to a degree and he knew how to mess it
[1:27:22] up in the garden I thought even he
[1:27:28] understood to a degree you know why
[1:27:30] because he was anointed sure of that
[1:27:32] stood beside the Lord
[1:27:33] what made he messed up was he just
[1:27:36] couldn't understand the devil just never
[1:27:39] could understand because he felt he was
[1:27:41] the right-hand man because he was the
[1:27:44] one standing beside the Lord what maybe
[1:27:49] mad you'd never think like that
[1:27:50] what made the devil mad and get him all
[1:27:52] bloated up and all this happening is
[1:27:55] when Michael stepped out one day and
[1:28:01] Michael is Christ and Lucifer was never
[1:28:07] given the opportunity to speak a world
[1:28:09] into existence but Michael did yeah well
[1:28:16] wait a minute Michael for the run said
[1:28:18] Michael is Christ so okay we solved the
[1:28:20] problem
[1:28:21] Michaels Christ he's not an angel
[1:28:25] he's Christ it's listed as an angel to
[1:28:31] where you cover it with your beings and
[1:28:33] serve Him you see when the devil got all
[1:28:40] upset he was the right-hand man but when
[1:28:43] things started coming towards this away
[1:28:45] and his plan began to unfold God's plan
[1:28:49] beginning on the foe
[1:28:50] see the devil was right there listening
[1:28:59] and as he was listening he was thought
[1:29:01] he was going to be part of it but then
[1:29:04] all at once sure stepped out Michael he
[1:29:07] found out real quick that he was not the
[1:29:09] right-hand man he found out he did now
[1:29:13] the position he thought he had so he got
[1:29:17] upset
[1:29:24] may I even quote go random that Satan
[1:29:27] has a knowledge of the principles of
[1:29:30] life is it true he new sees it all he
[1:29:35] had to do was get that serpent the Beast
[1:29:38] and Eve together and it would cause the
[1:29:43] fall he knew that was the only one could
[1:29:46] cause it he knew the monkey couldn't
[1:29:48] Mitch he had a knowledge of the
[1:29:49] principles and he knew that there's
[1:29:52] those two creations issued yet my friend
[1:29:57] Adam said it he first created angels
[1:30:00] amen
[1:30:03] he said God was his first creation in
[1:30:07] and out of him can the logos from from
[1:30:09] the low guys came to man well I'm just
[1:30:17] gonna take this one okay because you're
[1:30:18] not gonna listen the rest of the story
[1:30:21] the words your plan of redemption and
[1:30:25] what could be a reality of sons and
[1:30:29] daughters of God shouting for joy well
[1:30:34] it looks like son dog had be back on
[1:30:38] what is what do you
[1:30:45] that's looking at where we are right now
[1:30:57] safety knew God was making a plan he
[1:31:05] explained it God did because remember
[1:31:10] the story Angels created first they
[1:31:12] worshipped him made him God that's not
[1:31:16] that don't make them angels eternal they
[1:31:19] don't have anything to do with the plan
[1:31:21] of salvation except there are your
[1:31:22] helpers which are assigned to you after
[1:31:26] you get here in the Needham for what if
[1:31:29] it is that the sons and daughters of God
[1:31:36] somebody give me the day you were born
[1:31:38] again the day is born against you know
[1:31:46] what just a day for a time what if
[1:31:54] that's what God saw what if he was
[1:31:59] looking down here and he saw you
[1:32:04] shouting
[1:32:09] no no it's got to be back garlic see now
[1:32:12] now you're getting women in store you're
[1:32:14] gonna push it back dark but don't get
[1:32:15] all the stories anyway
[1:32:18] what if he's seeing the day you accepted
[1:32:21] him as your Savior he's not that what he
[1:32:27] saw in his mind is he not looking at you
[1:32:31] shouting over your salvation we were
[1:32:34] singing that song this morning you know
[1:32:36] and it's thinking it when you take that
[1:32:38] song you know
[1:32:40] god is good and then you pick it up and
[1:32:42] you bring it up into a higher form and
[1:32:44] see you can see that there's more to the
[1:32:47] story right
[1:32:50] what if you look down and seeing a shot
[1:32:52] in this morning
[1:33:00] are you not agreeing that to write the
[1:33:04] book of life that he would look down and
[1:33:06] see you accepting Jesus Christ as your
[1:33:08] Savior right would not be the day you
[1:33:16] receive Jesus Christ as your Savior that
[1:33:22] your name was written in heaven no now
[1:33:24] wait a minute
[1:33:25] see now you're transferring back before
[1:33:27] the foundation world I can quote brother
[1:33:31] Branham what do you like it or not I've
[1:33:32] been around too long
[1:33:33] everybody says your name goes on the
[1:33:35] book as a believer in sanctification but
[1:33:39] that's not the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:33:41] section that's the book of life section
[1:33:43] it's not eternal section but it does go
[1:33:47] on as a belief that's why Judas is named
[1:33:49] could be honored a believer because he
[1:33:52] comes through sanctification what are
[1:33:55] you saying what if God is looking down
[1:33:57] and seeing us right now what if this is
[1:34:01] what he saw what if he saw you shouting
[1:34:05] over your salvation
[1:34:07] everyone said it was the time what if it
[1:34:10] is that there was something happening in
[1:34:12] heaven that I won't have time to cover
[1:34:15] this part about it or take number three
[1:34:17] scripture it says in Genesis 1:26 and 27
[1:34:21] let us make man in our own image after
[1:34:24] our likeness and let them have dominion
[1:34:25] over it there's another scripture that
[1:34:30] was before the foundation of the world
[1:34:31] God said let us make man you say oh no
[1:34:38] that was over here on the sixth day
[1:34:40] that's the physical man it's a physical
[1:34:44] man of Genesis 2 it is created in
[1:34:47] Genesis 1 physical on the sixth day
[1:34:52] eternal life never had no beginning it
[1:34:56] has no engine showing you what happened
[1:34:59] before the world a lot your name is
[1:35:01] written on the Lamb's Book of Life or
[1:35:02] the lamp of the land and life of the
[1:35:04] Lamb I'm showing you shouting for glory
[1:35:07] over your religion you've had your
[1:35:08] salvation seeing the plan of salvation
[1:35:10] come into view that you could shout
[1:35:14] about it and God look all the way down
[1:35:16] and see that and say Amen what if he was
[1:35:19] explaining to what he was just sitting
[1:35:22] around and explaining to the angels you
[1:35:24] know part of my plan is he said well the
[1:35:28] devil knew the plan whatever to get to
[1:35:29] plane what if it was that he was
[1:35:34] explaining to the angels what he was
[1:35:36] going to do and explaining what would
[1:35:42] happen to those angels explain what they
[1:35:46] would do and how they would have a part
[1:35:47] to do with you and I what if he was
[1:35:51] explaining that to him that's what he
[1:35:56] had in his mind but he was explaining
[1:35:59] what would take place thousands of years
[1:36:01] later when you would receive it there's
[1:36:08] a lot going on in glory
[1:36:11] so Genesis 1:26 man is not a physical
[1:36:15] man earth creation would God himself
[1:36:22] then God created man in His image
[1:36:32] if you have eternal life he was in glory
[1:36:34] before the world ever begun see we've
[1:36:38] got to wait to get it you're on earth
[1:36:40] just like Jesus Christ is the lamb slain
[1:36:43] before the foundation of the world that
[1:36:46] had to wait for a thousand years ago to
[1:36:48] come into reality it was only spoken off
[1:36:55] until he died on Calvary and when he
[1:36:58] died on Calvary he sealed in the whole
[1:37:00] claim what if it is that he's enjoying
[1:37:07] your salvation
[1:37:08] I thought the Bible said that there was
[1:37:15] joy in heaven the Angels
[1:37:18] over what over one sinner who come for
[1:37:26] their rejoicing the angels are rejoicing
[1:37:31] because now they know they got something
[1:37:33] to do they're going to be able to come
[1:37:34] to earth what if the story is you're
[1:37:37] getting it what if God was sitting down
[1:37:38] explaining to the angel didn't like what
[1:37:40] he was going to do he's any problem with
[1:37:42] that and then he just brings on into
[1:37:48] reality the world and the life Satan
[1:37:52] takes his side and pulls it off but yet
[1:37:58] we come into the world and we accept him
[1:38:01] as our Savior what caused you to accept
[1:38:03] him as your Savior what was the plan
[1:38:05] what was the thing only the redeemed
[1:38:10] have angels all little babies don't have
[1:38:12] angels we see we want to put that up and
[1:38:14] night stories out of it
[1:38:15] it's a redeemed that have angels they're
[1:38:18] assigned to you and even before you
[1:38:24] accepted Jesus Christ that angel would
[1:38:27] be there and he'd take care of you
[1:38:33] and I quote vertebra he said thanks a
[1:38:36] little bit something different about you
[1:38:38] he said don't you remember when
[1:38:40] everybody else for me to get out in the
[1:38:41] world oh come on use it said everybody
[1:38:43] else want to get out in the world
[1:38:44] something he knew just held you
[1:38:49] but brother dad I can't so shake that
[1:38:51] because the devil got me and I went
[1:38:52] that's you between you and God
[1:38:55] I've told you my life story and I don't
[1:38:57] have to back up part I've told it for
[1:38:59] 4050 years when I was a sinner I would
[1:39:04] go out and do things wrong or say
[1:39:06] something wrong and I felt dirty
[1:39:08] I felt unclean I knew no God to confess
[1:39:13] my sins - but I felt dirty it was
[1:39:22] something wrong I didn't like it but I
[1:39:29] walked to the altar when I was 18 years
[1:39:31] old I said I want to know about God I
[1:39:41] had seen him when I was 11 years old in
[1:39:44] a Baptist Church standing at the altar I
[1:39:45] wanted to know about him I asked the
[1:39:52] people you know what old Baptist Deacon
[1:39:54] told me one day cause out of deacon at
[1:39:55] 23 years old and you know that's it
[1:39:57] that's not that's too old too young to
[1:39:59] be a deacon in a church the I asked her
[1:40:02] talking that dick and he said you need
[1:40:03] to go to some Pentecostal church for his
[1:40:06] old I you know I didn't know it that's
[1:40:08] what order does cuz they had more move I
[1:40:12] would ask people about God and the ways
[1:40:14] of doing back then I didn't back off
[1:40:18] like I told you before we were standing
[1:40:20] there one day and a visiting group of
[1:40:23] people was coming in the young girls
[1:40:24] were singing the choir and they were
[1:40:26] getting off the bus this old deacon was
[1:40:29] watching them get off the bus and he's
[1:40:31] watching them get off the bus I got
[1:40:33] right in his face and looked at him I
[1:40:34] said you're not supposed to do that
[1:40:37] this man was old enough to be my daddy
[1:40:39] he probably a deacon more age than I was
[1:40:42] I'm talking about it he's been probably
[1:40:44] over 23 years
[1:40:46] as a deacon and I look right this place
[1:40:48] that's his brother you're not supposed
[1:40:49] to do that you know what he said he said
[1:40:53] the Bible says look on my heritage I
[1:40:59] said but it don't say lust after his
[1:41:02] heritage I didn't become a this side of
[1:41:07] the other actor coming into message I've
[1:41:09] always had those lines in thoughts I'm a
[1:41:12] human being and I'm well in those lines
[1:41:16] but I've always known that was God and I
[1:41:20] just wanted to know about him that's all
[1:41:23] I do today I won't know about it I want
[1:41:25] my family to have an opportunity to know
[1:41:26] about a God that's real I'm with this
[1:41:28] church to have an opportunity to be able
[1:41:30] to know about a real God not just the
[1:41:36] thoughts of your mind and some the
[1:41:38] 'saturday other way to be a Christian
[1:41:41] let Christ come and live in your heart
[1:41:44] then you don't have to worry about
