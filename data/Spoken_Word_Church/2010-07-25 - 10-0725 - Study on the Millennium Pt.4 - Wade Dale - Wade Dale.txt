TRANSCRIPT
========================================
okay now here's the omitted version shake somebody's hand and say god bless you this morning now for those of you that listen for those of you that are going to camp we need to meet today um we can't meet in between services because i got a sermon to do this afternoon so it won't be long short won't be long be short we'll never run after the second part i've been told my sermon will be short today short meeting i'm sorry but i just we just need to know exactly who's coming and exactly when and if you're not if you're if you're even if you even have a question just say no okay because i don't want to depend on somebody and i know things come up but hey i got a i got a uh a plant manager that's going to be out friday saturday and sunday and they want me to stay at work you better pray because he's having a lung surgery he can't do anything he just came up instantly he's i think he's got um so anyway so that's serious all right but i told him i said look i said that's my ministry for the year for the young kids and i said to me it's just like church and i'm not going to miss it so we'll see how that works out plus uh a company came by just for a testimony for a minute the customer came by friday and we thought he was going to fire us we were doing seven 280 000 pounds of product with them a week they want us to do what's 15 times 40 600 they want us to do 600 000 more pounds instead of firing us so guess what wednesday we're opening the other plant back up again and i'm leaving thursday friday saturday and sunday so you flat for the opening of the plant but me being gone is important i don't know it is awesome that obviously they'll probably be jobs right we need to hire 150 people tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow we need 150 people can you cut chicken no actually we are hiring back the office help we have before so we don't have to need any office out we need general labor so anyway but to god be the glory because thursday we had a meeting thursday and the owners were like hey this we're going to do this if they fire us we're going to do this and we we're going to lose those seven loads but we're going to do this bunch business that's not totally into the story but they said because we've lost this we can do this so starting monday instead of doing 80 000 pounds of size a day we're gonna be doing four hundred thousand pounds a day so i said we need 150 people because they weren't expecting cooked foods they were expecting them to fire us so we'd have this to take over well now we got both of them make a long story short 15. 30. 1.2 million pounds of product is going to be going through the plant starting monday if we can get enough people where it was only 400 000 pounds but anyway but the the glory behind this is is i told the lord i said i've had enough of this up and down business we go in the meeting and we're going to lose everything we're going to meet and we're going to gain everything we're going to meet we're going to lose everything we're going to meet we're going to gain everything and i said lord i don't want that to happen about three o'clock friday morning i just woke right up lord just said it'll all work out they were so fearful friday morning that that company was going to tell us you know get out of here as soon as that man walked through the door because i know it as soon as that man walked through the door i could look in his face and i could have walked in and told him they're not gonna fire us they gonna give us three times more what we're doing so don't do it if you're just asking right all right let's get finished with this we're going to finish this up and then next sunday we probably won't have sunday school because most of us will be gone okay um we just won't have it for the sake of just nobody being here much and then the next sunday lord willing june and i will be in saint augustine florida um preaching brother keith brown so we'll be on that sunday but i had already asked brother joe last week if he would take that weekend and i'm not knowing that brother keith brown was gonna call you know he called it wednesday right so i asked you lord knows how to work everything out he knew it before i did he knows all things so we know the lord's on he's on the scene so let's turn to revelations 21 and let's try to finish this up today with a parallel between the millennium and the future home just for a recap we know that the millennium i'm gonna back up so you can all see that the millennium we know is time all right i kind of made kind of self-explanatory here millennium is time we're still in the seventh day rest we don't enter the eighth day until we get into the future home but now listen you and i that are born again this morning we're already in that eighth day all right we're already in eternity already have crossed over from time to eternity that's why the bible can say we're sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus already eternal but there's a process like everything there's a process to this and the process is that we we had sin over here in the garden man fell man came through the old testament came to the new testament god testifying and we'll kind of look into that this afternoon in the appearing and the coming of the lord like brother dale's been preaching but i want to kind of take it in a little different angle um but what happens here is then everything after the it kind of hooks in with the daniel 70 weeks that we've been doing at the end of that last week to the jews to the world then you start blending into the millennium but it's still time time is still going on we're still going to have days and times and seasons all right now remember here is going to be atomic fire right that's going to destroy the world bottle of armageddon we're going to come back into the millennium after a three and a half year wedding supper the millennium will be the bride's honeymoon all right right but it's going to be our eternal home because we're in our eternal home right here in in this this man will be body spirit soul eternal but the world has to come behind and follow through right right right so in the millennium he's not going to be to us a son of david because the bible says that he'll sit on the throne of david ruling the 12 tribes of israel now we'll be sitting on the throne with him but in the millennium is our honeymoon but to the jews it'll be the time of the building of this temporary city and i believe the reason that in ezekiel 40-44 you can read that that's a temporary city because that city will be destroyed after battle of gog and magog all right because everything will be destroyed battle of gog and magog they'll be everything will be gone right um in the millennium he'll be the son of david to us he's already all in all but when we get into the future home that's when he's all in all to everybody all right so that's the difference between these two it's our honeymoon it's our eternal home in the future home this is just a honeymoon now basically in a type your honeymoon where you go on your honeymoon is not your permanent home right usually you go off somewhere now some of you go home somewhere but what i'm saying is normally okay if you go on a honeymoon you don't want to just go back to your house you want to go somewhere special and enjoy all the pleasures that are there all right then go to your normal home right or eternal home all right so that's for the bride that's the bride's honeymoon we'll be here for a thousand years just to walk through the earth to go into this temple and be able to explain to each person of the 144 thousand maybe they'll they know about this temple but they don't know all the significance about this temple what it meant to go into justification outer court inner court and holy holies all right so you and i will be able to expound to them and then from that it's going to convert after sin is done away with because remember sin is still here in the millennium it's not in the millennium but it's still alive all those demons that that depressed you they're still somewhere but they're not on this earth brother branham said they're bound with a chain the bible says angel goes and gets the chain binds the devil puts him in a pit why is he why is he bound he's bound because you and i are eternal we have an eternal mind the only people he can get to is maybe the heathen that may be raised up in the millennium i don't you know that's something we don't even need to be discussing we just need to make sure we know how to get there all right now the bible says we'll build houses and gardens and etc and in the future home there's no building because we're going to read right here in just a second that home was built when jesus in john 14 says i go to prepare play i go to prepare a place for you that's not the millennium millennium is a natural happening still in time still god can still walk among us though still jesus christ can walk among us but this earth and some of the things that are around are still going to have spirits but they're going to be bound but at the battle of gog and magog those spirits are going to be killed sin is going to be done away with everything's going to be brought back to its rightful position temporary world that's exactly what it is it says heaven and earth will pass away in other words the old the old form of the earth will pass away we'll have a temporary world but if the devil's still around somewhere it's not perfect right or eternal until all this is done away with and then it converts into an eternal world here what we're talking about all right after the battle of gog and magog which burns see it's the type of brother brown or uh john said to baptize you with holy ghost and fire baptize you with the holy ghost when he gives you the holy ghost and fire which will burn this guy up that you're looking at and he'll become eternal same thing with the world world's gotta go through the same process you and i went through justification under moses sanctification under jesus baptism of the holy ghost under the fire of god only in the fire of man the holy ghost is your earnest it's not the full redemption it's the earnest but right here is where we get our fullness but the world doesn't get its fullness do you understand this world gets its fullness because we're baptized with the holy ghost and fire we get a body change here then the world has to be changed temporary world turns into an eternal world same world it's just made eternal same body right right it's just made eternal temporary city ezekiel 40 through 44 is a temporary temple all right but this one we're going to talk about now revelation 21 and 22 is an eternal city it'll never change there'll be no difference in it from from eternity to eternity all right this city is going to change this city is going to be destroyed right here is the city that abraham looked for right the bible says we have no continuing city i mean they're continuing down here but we have one that's not right this city right here in in its earnest form is in me and you now that's why it says the earnest of your resurrection the earnest brother brownson when you get the holy ghost you just get started it's a little dip then you have to grow all right same thing with the world it gets a temporary burning right here then it has to go through the millennium then it goes through the fire of god then the eternal city comes in revelation 21-22 now let's read it and then we'll okay listen before we read is there any questions the white throne that's the fire of god the white throne is the fire god which is the judgment seat and that's where you and i'll sit and we don't judge the 12 tribes of israel the bible says the saints will judge the earth right angels will even have to be judged by humans that are born again born again human beings all right but the white throne judgment after the white throne judgment you're going to see that god's going to come down and burn every bit of this off and then brother the bible i keep saying brother but he quotes the bible says we read it right here let's go back to chapter 20. verse 7 and when the thousand years are expired satan shall be loosed out of his prison and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth god and magog to gather them together to battle the number of whom is the sand to the earth what satan do in some way he's unlocked that fifth dimension or or whatever and he's going to bring everybody up all the demons in the world it's ever been because brother brown said demons don't die spirits don't die they just move from one place to the other he said the same demon that was uh that was in legion when it went into them pigs when they died when the pigs died the devils left them and just went in some more people all right so now dog and make all together together the number of whom to sin and see and they went up on the breadth of the earth and come past the camp of the saints about and the beloved city now that's got to be the millennium city all right that's not the city that's not it's not the city coming down us what's the problem yeah absolutely that's the biology manga are we really going to be tested well no but look listen and they went up on the breadth of the earth and compassed the camp of the saints about and the beloved city that's us we're down here living in this millennium right and fire came down from god out of heaven and devoured them burnt them up didn't burn us we already had our burning it's going to burn them up now the question was and i agree that i don't know whether that's going to happen before the white throne or after it looks like to me it could be either one but it looks like to me more that somewhere because remember scripture is not exactly verse one two three four five and that's the way it happens there's a lot of things inserted taken out so you could insert maybe right in here in the beloved city stop right there and then that's when the white throne judgment comes in because god's got to judge those demons before he can do what he's doing if i understand he's got a he said just god everybody's going to have a judgment all right and remember brother brown said god made the heavens and the earth period then he started with the very next sentence he said it could have been a million or a billion years in between those two those two verses right here we could see that and compassed the camp of the saints about in the beloved city well hey if you've got all the saints if you got all the dead if you got all the demons what a time to have a white throne judgment right because that's where it's going to happen everybody's going to be gathered together right because right here it's going to tell you about the great white throne in verse 11. and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are in other words there's some people going in first that beast in the false prophet must be going in first it shall be tormented day and night forever and i saw a great white throne and him sat upon it whose face the earth and heaven fled away and there was found no place for them what a place right there for to be the battle of gog and magog right in there somewhere all right and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were opened another book was open which was the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which are written in the books according to their works and the sea gave up the dead which were in the death death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell were cast in the lake of fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written and the book of life was cast into the lake of fire now let's have a battle of gog and my god because the battle of gog and magog kills spirits it's a spiritual right then the earth is going to get its total cleansing because chapter 21 is a continuation john's standing after that saul what a new city come down now until we had a prophet we didn't know what all this happened but brother brown said that a mountain's going to push up right over there where the other one did in jerusalem the mountain's going to push up brother brown said he said look he said same place abraham fed cafta melchizedek is the same place that that mountain's going to push up right there in palestine right up there so actually he was looking for a city and it was right under his feet in a natural sense the mountain but see that mountain's not the city that mountains where the city's going to sit on i mean i can see that's so plain that that mountain is going to it's going to come up you know and it's not going to be just a straight shot it could be you know it could be just like this it's going to be 1500 miles so they may be 500 miles between a dip and a right and a rise a dip in their eyes there's one thing for sure this is where the lamb is going to sit and the throne will be and then what's going to happen i believe is is guess what that part is going to come from here set down on this and and i put it for illustration two lines but in actuality it's one line right it's just going to sit down right on every curve and nook and cranny those houses are going to just sit right down and you it's going to be you and i standing on that mountain and then what we're going to do is we're going to okay brother branham gives the illustration that we'll go up and see that he's the on that will worship him all right that's what it says on the bottom and then now you're going to have your wall which is going to be 212 feet high which that's not too high 1500 miles is gonna be way above that then you're gonna have your your your gates three gates on each side three fours is twelve they're all going to have the name of the apostles and all that foundations are gonna be abraham isaac jacob and joseph the four corners all right let's read i saw a new heaven in the new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away there were no more sea and i john so and that didn't say that didn't say ocean i said see okay well don't worry there's going to be water there's going to be an ocean now john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for a husband and what do you do when you're a bride you start with your body and then what do you do you put on the garment put on this stuff and all that stuff put on them real tight things to make you look skinny on that day but you don't put on your worst you put on your best and that's what this city is going to be it's what you and i have been putting on down here because this city is built on the word of god which the word of god is in you and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men now that god is the same form and same i got a circle in my bible i looked it up it's the same as genesis 1 1. right same because you look because it's god with the people treaty it's not god it's not big o.g anymore god's with his people in the beginning god because remember we were there with him in in theophany right in the beginning god that same god is the same in the greek as this god so i wrote my bible back to the beginning and that's exactly what it is it's total restoration from where in the beginning god started this thing and that same god that started it is going to finish it and you and i are part of it behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death no sorrow no crying there shouldn't be any more pain but former things have passed away he that sat upon the throne said behold i make all things new now you see that remember daddy preached on that not too long ago why is that not in red every other thing that jesus who is almighty god has said has been in red letter because he's back to the all in all he's back to the beginning why didn't you why didn't you go back to the beginning because everything that god spoke into existence is not in red letter but that creator god was jesus christ right but he's come back to his original form you and i are with him now outside of him so he's come back and he's who's he talking to you and i you don't have to be in red letter all right behold i make all things new and he said unto me right for these things are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega now who is alpha omega people always talk who is for the media the bride he's out the alpha bride no mega bride it's the same right he's sending me and he's done now i'm alpha omega the beginning and the end i was given to him the thirst to found the water of freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things i shall be his god and he shall be my son which are fearful and unbelieving and abominable murderers whoremongers sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the label which burns with fire and brimstone which is the second death showing that john's saying hey these people are not going to be here they were but these people are not going to be here all right and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vows full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither i will show thee the bride the lamb's wife and he carried me away in the spirit through great high mountain and showed me that great city now he don't sound here and show him a bunch of people but by revelation we see that the people are the city because he said he said come hither i will show thee the bride the lamb's wife and say come heather and i'll show you the city huh because if you were to read this i'd read come heather i will show thee the bride of the lamb's wife and he carried me away in the spirit to a great high mountain and there stood a great bunch of people they didn't say that he showed me a great city the holy jerusalem descending out of heaven from god which goes back to chapter 21 verse one and two having the glory of god and her light when you say the city of lula turned out for a parade the buildings didn't all walk up to the edge of the road and the houses all of them didn't pack up next to the road and wave their little flags no the people of the city of lula but when they say it they say the city of lula came out all right all right and he had it and had a wall great and high let's start right there stop right there her light was locked into a stone most precious even like a gas stone clear as crystal all right so i gotta answer uh sister got a question but we may take one more because i want to finish that chapter and go to the next one so you know keep that in your mind for a few weeks put it on hold pause and we'll try to get into it all right kathy will you uh when you were talking about building houses okay you said there won't be no man-made stuff won't you just speak the word well i didn't say there wouldn't be no man-made stuff i just said there wouldn't be no listen you ever thought about this everybody gets so carnal when they're supposed to be spiritual and they get so spiritual when they're supposed to be carnal think about this you think well my gosh i'm going to have calluses i'm going to be sore i'm going to no we're thinking we're thinking in human terms but let me prove one thing to you well i get this cramp out of my foot back in the bible there was a man named solomon solomon remember david said god i don't want you to dwell in a little tent i want you to dwell in a house and god said that's wonderful build me a temple then david did what he did with bathsheba and god said i've taken that away from you but your son will build me one now what did the bible say happened to the building in that of the building of that temple what'd he say what'd the bible say there was not a sound of a hammer how in the world can you build something so glorious as a temple that was uh solomon temple was the greatest temple that ever was and the bible said there was not a sound of a hammer brother branham said those pieces fit together without any hammer and nails that's during the sin curse that's during the earth when we were building things i believe it'll happen the same way if you have one time in the natural i won't worry about it right here so it will be like it is speaking the word but i think we'll put the thing together i mean i'm just dumb enough to believe that solomon and if you'll remember in the book i think they cut the stones away yes they did they did and you remember who that was gentile that's right gentiles solomon made a pact with this man and i because uh i'll find it for next time because brother uh uh tim humes was preaching on unity fellowship when we started going to the medicine meeting and he preached on solomon and whoever this guy was this guy was a gentile and he lived on the coast and he had the river frontage and all that stuff and solomon just said hey i need this and so and that's and so and thus and so and the guy just brought it to him and all they do is when they brought it to israel they just went like a like lincoln logs and they just started putting the thing together all everything fit fit perfect i don't see why we that same thing can't happen now we'll do this because we want to now i believe the millennium temple will be constructed by the jews right because the bible said it would be built by their hand just like the pyramid they said sure exactly there's no way you could have a machine that put that together like that well it's all going to be because of the spoken word so this is like donnie said the spoken word made the first temple god said solomon you'll build the temple for me right won't be no sound of a hammer it won't be no sound of a saw it'll be put together in other words what he was doing he was showing a prefigure of this and this right only in earthly terms way back in the old testament because he never wanted to dwell in a city but he always wanted to dwell in this eternal city because who is that eternal city me and you that's what he wanted all right good questions
