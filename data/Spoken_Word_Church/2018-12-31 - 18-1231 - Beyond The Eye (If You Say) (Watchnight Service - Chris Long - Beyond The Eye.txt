our heart this afternoon as their brother Chris alone comes you pull on the word he's he's uh let's see Arizona is three hours behind so he - - now okay so he's got two hours of extra energy in his

better wherever you want I didn't turn it on we're good now hey guess what though I got my jacket yeah I got my tie and I got my glasses this year all right well I can do it comfortably anyway hey man not that I was uncomfortable last year god bless you thank you musicians wonderful to hear you and wonderful to be here and I first of all want to say thank you to brother Samuel for permitting me to be here for having the confidence again for me to come and speak to you all I deem it a great privilege a great honor and and so we'll just pray that the Lord would take control not just of me but also a view and that we could receive what he has for us for this moment that's an appropriate song because the title of the message is beyond the eye and I like I title it that way but I want to pose it this way to you is there anything beyond the eye now there's gonna be some to shake your head no and there's gonna be some that shake your head yep and there's gonna be some that go I don't know well by the grace of God and through the revelation of his word we're just gonna find out and I do have a subtitle if you say so let's just see if there is something beyond the eye shall we amen I'd like you to take your Bibles and turn to Isaiah chapter 55 if you would and I know these brothers put these things up on the screen I'm not quite there yet but that's alright I'll get there amen are you with me hey man isaiah 55:8 9 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and this is the key to me tonight my thoughts he says than your thoughts his thoughts are higher than ours let's see if we can climb Jacob's Ladder tonight and get into the mind of God shall we let's pray Heavenly Father were just thankful Lord where we're standing here father because we love you and we love your children Lord and we want to do anything we can to further ourselves Lord into the kingdom father we realize that it's a trying time Lord that the devil is as a roaring lion but he is not the Lion of the tribe of Judah as he would try to portray himself as Lord he is not the Word of God his ways are not your ways his thoughts are not your thoughts so father were asking father that you'd forgive us first of all of our sins in our trespasses Lord that the precious blood of Jesus Christ could be applied and father that you'd let the mind of our hearts be open to attain that higher ground bless your children for their efforts bless all those Lord that are out there at the end of the broadcast Lord we'll be sure to always give you the honor and the glory and the praise in the lovely name of Jesus Christ we ask it amen god bless you you may be seated sure-sure I may need it now this is just my second time doing this and and of course they asked me last year could you go for hours I said I don't think so so today so they add they said could you go an hour and a half I said I could do that yeah hopefully I won't go for hours brother Samuel but it'll be up to the Lord I know I need to relax so that the Lord can just take me and use me you need to relax now III do I have no problem with you putting on your spiritual thinking cap and your and your spiritual seatbelt and and and your antennas up and but what's most important is that you have a thinking man's filter nothing more important that in the day and age we live in and the thinking man's filter is the Holy Ghost now there can be that can become a controversial subject you know you can be baptized with the Holy Ghost every day of your life and be lost and go to hell did you know that now that kind of grotton's on people you know because then then when you make that statement a sense of why I got the Holy Ghost and then you can have it every day of your life and be lost and go to hell what gives let me tell you folks something if you get the person of the Holy Ghost which is Jesus Christ a lot of people don't know who Jesus Christ another way all they see him as as a benevolent man somewhere thank you brother somewhere in years was double portion I like it somewhere in his early 30s to mid 50s that's the way they see him you know breaking the bread and handing out the fish and healing the sick and and saying really good kind words that have life in them but I'm finding out even in the ranks of the believers today that you and I are acquainted with they're losing sight of the fact that he was the word made flesh that's why the prophet of God constantly reminded us to stay with the word because they realized the importance of the word because without all the word you can't have all the word made flesh now a lot of people have part of the word and they become part of the word made flesh the problem with that is there's still a portion of themselves in there and they're going to try to take the part of the word that they have and they're using to be made flesh hybrid with what they think we have to lose our minds as I was telling brother Wade today I've got to lose the last two marbles I got because it's the mind of Christ that's going to make the difference now we all are out here in the congregation I'm up here and behind the pulpit and we're all thinking I hope now some of you may fall asleep I know you're I might call your name this is a test now it's only a test okay so I didn't get up here to bore you but I want you to relax and I'm not going to preach anything to you that that that's new I couldn't the Bible says there's nothing new Under the Sun so no matter how mixed our convoluted or how straight or how level or how there's nothing now it may be new to you but there's nothing new so before I get started I want to lay something out to you because I've got a little bit of time I'm usually in a hurry brother Samuel because I'm conscious of the clock and and the Spirit is willing but the flesh is oh so weak I understand that now listen if if you start to get tired because the heats coming through the building and the hour grows late stand up listen there's nothing wrong with stretching your legs and while you're stretching them give a little how do you yeah was brother brother Wade was introducing me to his sister that likes to shuffle na sis there ain't nothing wrong with a little shuffle now but listen brothers and sisters you know you see that they we live in and and people have become cold you know dormant who I'm gonna preach on that here in a minute and they become you know kind of laid-back and really the biggest problem we've got is we're know-it-alls now I don't know it all I find out the more that I search into the depths of God word Wow the more that I hear the ministry that God hath placed Wow there's all kinds of things that I don't know but I know the God who knows them that's the key we need that God living in us so that our ways are not our ways his ways need to be our ways his thoughts need to be our thoughts we need to get rid of our own selfish selfie I know y'all take selfies I don't like them I don't like them because first of all I'm not very photogenic no matter what camera or phone you're using with the 7 lenses and the and the 20,000 pixels it doesn't make a lick a difference but it's just a sign of the times you know don't don't feel bad if you take selfies that's not what I'm getting out I'm getting out look at the age we live in it's a selfish self-centered me me me me me well let me tell you folks something the reason how we can tell that you have eternal life oh there's a formula there's a chemistry are you living for others Oh most folks want to go home now yeah I am not living for anybody else but myself well you're gonna have a problem now brothers and sisters I have to preach to myself what I get up here behind this sacred desk and say I also have to believe I have to live it I have to surrender to it I know that so a minister of the gospel has a much much more difficult line to walk because not only does he have to preach it he has to live it that's how God begins to deliver a greater revelation to you and I he will not give us any more than we can take so just how much can you take we need to lose ourselves now that doesn't mean we become psychotic it doesn't mean we become watch this an isolationist Oh see that's what this selfie age leads to doesn't it me myself and I and that's all there is and that's all there needs to be and that's all there's gonna be that's the age we live in well I want everybody to understand something Satan is not a creator do you believe that Satan is not a creator then where in the world did that spirit come from that spirit has to be a perversion of something real and I'm gonna tell you what it is he said I am God I changed not I'm one God and there will be no other gods before me that's where this age spirit came from it's just perverted all right so first of all I'd like to say that to me the message of the hour that you and I claim to believe notice I said you and I so no feelings hurt okay is not a different subject matter than this Bible I want to make that clear before I go any further what the message of the hour represents to me now is there any brothers and or sisters in here that have ever looked at a set of blueprints for a house for a building a schematic for instance and then I know there are probably brothers in here who have attempt to remodel or build and I only use the word attempted because it doesn't always work out you know III I was a carpenter for many years and then I became a mechanic because I couldn't swing a hammer anymore properly wore myself out and IIIi can see now that this this these little cute little signs that you buy down at Hobby Lobby have truth in them right away I saw sign there that said this is my labor rate okay 45 dollars an hour and this is my labor rate if you worked on it that's fifty five dollars an hour and this is my labor rate if it didn't work out for you that's seventy five dollars an hour and this is my labor rate if you try to help me it's a hundred dollars an hour and the reason that I say that is because that's the world we live in we're always trying to put our hands on something we're not qualified to do but because of the dy I sorry brother Samuel and and sister Peggy but it comes to mind chip and Joanna they're really good at marketing their stuff and they're probably really good at doing what they do but they make it look so easy it wasn't that long ago when I was doing a little remodeling and a lady asked me she said could you do my bathroom remodel my bathroom and she showed me some pictures out of you know Better Homes and Gardens and out of the do-it-yourself magazine and so forth and she said you know and I saw this this couple do it it wasn't chipping Joanna I saw this couple do it on the television and they and all it turned out so nice so I looked over the material list and I looked over and then I measured the existing bathroom and I had some questions written down a night and I said okay that's that's that's gonna cost about $6,500 and she said well how much do you charge per hour and I said well I I mean you know I averaged around forty fifty dollars an hour if I'm really doing good and I averaged about a negative ten dollars an hour if I've made a lot of mistakes it's true for anybody that works out there for anybody it's it's funny because it's true then she said but but that's outrageous she said it should only take you about three hours this is a true story I said what do you mean ma'am I said I got to tear this out and I got to do this and I got to redo the plumbing and I gotta put this curb over here build this and then I gotta lay this that's gonna take me about six weeks she said no sir I saw it on the television they did this whole job in three hours and there was commercials in between brothers and sisters that's the world we live in that's the way we're trying to find our way through God's Word come on now I want it right now Lord I'm going I'm going somewhere with it all right so so to me the endtime message the words that God gave to you and I you notice I didn't say gave them to William rather the words of God that he gave to you and I through William Branham because he was an instrument that God chose to use to speak to you and I now a lot of other people heard what he said but only one group of people is going to get to the kernel to the drain to the essence of what God said through that man now you and I may not be those people but I believe we can be I don't see any reason why we shouldn't be all right because it's going to boil down to if you say before this is all over but what we're struggling with is the fact that many of the things that you and I read and hear and see with our eye we begin to process and then our minds begin to engage and we begin to think there's our first mistake now that doesn't mean we should be I mean brother Branham didn't teach come up here to with a blank mind he said come up here with a repentant heart you come up to the altar with a repentant heart and if you're truly repented you'll go away with the beginning of the process of transformation that can take place in your life but I see the message now as something greater than I ever saw in the early part of my walk because I have held a set of blueprints many of you brothers have probably and a blueprint to the Christian is this book from cover to cover this is the plan of God this is the blueprint of God but what the message of the hour represents are the details your brothers who looked at blueprints see if I was smart enough I to give the brother of your thing to put up your blueprint and then we could have I could have shown you what a detail is but anybody who's looked at it planned knows that you've got this this one-dimensional drawing let me hold this back up you've got this one-dimensional drawing that you can read and that you can look at but very very difficult for most people to get this one dimensional drawing into three dimensions something tangible something that's got depth and breadth and height and width that's what the fivefold ministry is for God hath placed some with the ability that God gave them to anybody can look at a bit of blueprint anybody with eyesight can look at the blueprint anybody that can read can read the blueprint but it's the details and the details listen now on a set of blueprints are generally identified by symbols sometimes they're circles sometimes they're squares sometimes they're rectangles sometimes they're circles with rectangles in them or squares and them or diamonds in them or pyramids in them and I've preached this here already Revelation is a book of symbols what is this symbol something that stands for something else so a man that knows how to read the blueprint and recognize the details he says hmm my thoughts are not your thoughts my ways are not your ways but there's a symbol that's indicating to that person that he should look somewhere else in the blueprint for a magnified detail something that shows now listen here's the killer I'm gonna I'm gonna read the word magnified to help you okay so so a magnification is you're looking at the same exact object even the young people in here no has anybody ever put anything under a microscope in school or how about look through a telescope you look out in the sky you see the moon you see the stars but you begin to magnify it you're looking at the same moon you're looking at the same stars you're looking at the same leaf for insect that's under the microscope the same exact one no different no change but yet there's a power there that gives you the ability to begin to focus down or focus out and see much much finer details of the same exact object that's what the message of the hour represents it is the magnification remember what brother Branham taught us that Jesus did not come to break the law but he came to fulfill the law the scripture says and brother Branham said magnify he didn't come to do away with the law he came to magnify the law the message of the hour didn't come to do away with the blueprint it came to magnify it that's that's the very reason why for instance brother Samuel marriage and divorce I don't have a problem with it because first of all we can go to the blueprint right Paul said this over and Timothy Paul said this over here Jesus said this over here tied tightest oh we just keep looking but somehow through the age we live in they call it the age of consciousness men look at the blueprint and they begin to make their own details now did brother branham have to go and ask where's Paul's group thank you bye when he went beyond the curtain of time he said where I mean after listen think about it the tremendous ministry that brother Branham had been given by God to use and all of the things that happened the raising of the Dead the healing of the sick the discernment of the heart the creation of squirrels and on and on and on and so forth and he gets beyond the curtain of time you don't think you didn't know who he was but he wanted to make sure that he was using the original blueprint he wanted to confirm that the message that God gave him that he preached to leave to the likes of you and I was perfect I think it's interesting brother Samuel that brother Bentham didn't say well he did ask where Jesus was right and they say he's a little higher you can't see him right now hmm Jesus isn't here okay so now what do I do where's Paul where's Paul it's Paul's group here can you believe that brother branham had to ask that where's Paul I mean the tremendous ministry the tremendous amount of Word of God in Revelation but he still had to confirm a detail this Paul's group here yep and everybody in the congregation shouted out praise the Lord yeah where I preached what Paul preached he said we're resting on that so I was at one of those ministerial meetings one day bruh the way then they were all bickering over marriage and divorce than the ministry and I said brothers they didn't ask me I just said brothers there shouldn't be one question about merging divorce in the ministry not a lot whoa man they all got sided and they all looked over there like this guy thinks he knows a lot what kind of a big-shot is this I'm not a big-shot I said there are two details ones and Timothy and ones in Titus there shouldn't be any question and they kind of you know like what do you got a special special revelation on that no no no no brother Branham had to ask it's Paul's group here I'm asking I'm asking this pause group here yes why because he taught what Paul taught and there's no variation there's no deviation because you remember the friend brother branham had who had the dream and he was given a set of blueprints and brother Branham had been talking to him about water baptism and he just couldn't see it so he went to bed that night had a dream about man giving him a set of broop blueprints to build a house and this man began to build and apparently it was a good builder he didn't need any help he was doing it all by himself and he got to the part where there was like a bay window I think or something like that in the house and he said now it ain't gonna go that way I'm gonna do it the way I want to do it even though the product came out looking beautiful that product was not built according to the blueprint so when the man who he was building the house for came back he said what in the world are you doing hey check it out I built you a really nice Kingdom here I got this beautiful revelation right here and the man said that is not the way that I put it down tear it down and build it exactly like the blueprint now brothers and sisters that may not sessom seems like a funny story but that place was built as good as that man could build it the owner of that house picked that contractor because he knew he would build it correctly as far as the statics as far as the eye could see is there anything beyond the eye I'm gonna keep driving at it till it is there anything beyond the yes there is it's the thought that produced the drawing and when that man came back and he saw that his house was not built the way he put it down on paper he said tear it down and build it correctly and you all know the story that man woke up from that dream and he got brother branham and said let's go down to the creek I need to get baptized been thinking about it all wrong all right so now let's take your Bible let's look at a detail proverbs 23:7 most of you probably even know this one but let's see praise the Lord getting warm up here the heater is working good that's alright when you got its amen I can take my jacket off for as he thinketh in his heart so is he as a man thinketh in his heart brother Brad said so is he now as I mentioned the other day at brother Michael takes and I'll do it here because not all of you were here you know there's been a philosophical disagreement going on ever since the Greek philosophers began to argue with one another and I could probably get their names wrong and you could you could look it up and help me Plato and Socrates maybe the two guys their names are familiar and they argued you know they argued about where a human beings mind came from one of them said it's right here in this grey matter right here this is where you and I think and the other one said nah no there's a deeper thinking capacity than this up here and of course he he didn't mean the heart muscle but he meant the spirit of the heart of a human being and he said that's where a man thinks and they argued about it all the time now remember that's how Satan saw mankind because in the greatest battle ever fought God said oh you want to be not like me because God told us we should want to be like him is that right let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus thinking it not robbery to be equal with God see the mind okay and but Satan wanted to be greater than not equal to and God said okay all right you want to battle I'll give it to you they said choose your weapon Saint instead I'll take the mind and do you know we're saying got that idea for Satan knew that the scripture said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and when you take your Scofield Bible and you look in there and it says in the beginning was the logos is that right and the logos was with God and the logos was God and the logos was made flesh and dwelt among and then if you look a little deeper into the word logos you see it means thought or concept so then in the beginning the thought of the concept was with God the thought of this concept was made flesh so Lucifer with his intellectual value said I'll take the thinking capacity of man and I'll win take on the Almighty and once I gain control of the mind of man because he knew the word was going to be made flesh I will be greater than God himself God said yeah I knew he'd say that that's kind of the precursor to I told you so which we all used so often but God isn't doing it to try to prove to anybody that he's smarter than or knew more than he just knew Lucifer you pick what you picked and I'll take the heart that's what brother venom taught us I'll take the heart and for many years that argument ensued about where does man think okay you know this and then some years go by and science begins to dissect the human body and eventually they find out that there's this little place in the muscle we call the heart it has seemingly no value seemingly no function what's it for God speaks through a prophet and he says that is your heart that's where your soul abides that's where that little bitty light that God has ordained for you enters brother Branham said about the size of a body and I don't know if you've ever seen the dissection of a human heart but that little hollow space is about the size of an almond because I seen it I went and looked and I said wow that's tremendous I never disbelieve what brother Branham said but it certainly is nice to see for yourself is that right but what's really peculiar brothers and sisters about the Word of God is that there is something beyond the eye but very few people ever come to the recognition of it now I've got hours worth of material but I'm not going to do that because I didn't know how long brother samuel was gonna ask me to minister but my sole purpose and goal is for you to be able to see the details of the blueprint that pertain to you because that's what matters if we're preaching to or about someone else okay but how does that help me okay but how does that get me further into the kingdom god that's the very reason why and it's okay if I be blunt I'm sure that's the very reason why I struggle with the people who think that brother Branham has got to return to finish something even though I'm from the West I'm an oddball I'm a square peg my wife says in a round hole and that makes perfect sense because I'm a carpenter I can drive a round peg through a square hole you can't get a square peg through a round hole try it sometime and what it has to do with brothers and sisters is that of course then I've said this year and I am not impugning in any way shape or form the Prophet I mean III God is not a respecter of persons and we have to find ourselves with the mind of God how is that possible how is it possible for you and me to become a non respecter of persons you will talk about a greatest battle ever father you know we look at somebody we don't like the way they look we don't like the way they sound we don't like the way they talk we don't like whether they got here or no air more air great hair black hair their ears are big there's all kinds of reasons why we look at things and we make judgments Wow now I just don't like that guy why not I don't know I still like the way he looks come on we've all been in these shoes you're a real special person if that's something has never happened to you okay and even children you know I mean come on maybe they don't know why didn't know stay away from that they don't usually say it but they certainly do show it and it's because there is something beyond the eye and brothers and sisters the quicker you and I get to that place where we have a revelation I could use the word understanding but a lot of that throws a lot of people all brother you don't got to understand nothing well I have to agree with that because the Prophet said that but he also said to see us to understand so which one you have to be able to dovetail them both you can come to the Lord with zero understanding as a matter of fact you can come to the Lord with a lot of understanding but what God's going to do like he did Paul and Moses let's take you out into the desert a dry place and clean you out so you know nothing except Jesus Christ and him crucified of it when you get to that place then God begins to build and your understanding begins to expand and you don't become a theologian you become a child of God a son or a daughter of God why because God is dealing with you on an intimate level and he's beginning to take you into himself still with me I see the return word kind of shook a little bit a little water splashed in the boat but we talked about that earlier today we can bail that water out don't be afraid somebody who's taught right doesn't have to be afraid of anything except themselves you love him as a man thinketh in his heart so is he so in order for us to think the way God thinks then we have to have the mind of God is that right and the only way we can get the mind of God is to get rid of our own that's the danger that's the very place where most of us human beings begin to falter and trip because we're afraid of becoming nothing we're afraid we're afraid of the unknown I mean what if we become nothing and then he doesn't pick me up and use me [Music] that's human nature God knew that so God had a plan and that plan has details brothers and sisters you and I would still be arguing about the scripture without the details no it goes this way no that's a tuba 6 no that's a tuba 4 no that's the one before no that's ruff senior no that's redwood no that's pine no that's but go to the details and those details begin to reveal to you and I exactly the way God wants it to me in a nutshell that's what the message of the hour represents all right you still with me all right magnify to make greater in size status or importance it means to enlarge to cause to seem greater did you catch that that's why we're struggling with who sometimes the profit is I don't know brother I wouldn't say that if I were you brother branham was a man it was a man God used like I was going to say a minute ago while I don't want to esteem anybody higher than anybody else if you were to ask me from a human intellectual standpoint brother where do you place brother branham well I'd have to put him in top five top three Jesus Christ is number one well then the age we live in brother Branham would have to be number two I mean the age we live in now when if you lived in Paul's age uh-huh yeah brother Branham wasn't number two paula's you got me and that's the way we need to remember that God is portraying his word he's one God he's a jealous God and he will have no other gods before him not prophets not preachers not even you not me oh it gets tough done it it's a rough ride but I'm gonna tell you what this ride is doing brothers and sisters is building your character through all the ups and downs the ins and outs the bumps the scrapes the burns along the way God is building character now you and I think it's our character he's building I Got News for you he's bringing his character through you and me it's like I like to point this out to people even though I may have said it here now can you imagine the all-knowing omniscient omnipotent omnipresent God saying hey Adam where are you he knew don't you think he knew where Adam was but the reason he posed the question was not for himself it was for Adam now today in our lingo we'd say hey we're yeah brother yeah how about Abraham you don't think God didn't know brother Wade that Abraham was gonna sharpen the knife put Isaac on the pile of wood have a match ready and we am what we see is human beings with our own eyes because of television and and then and so forth in Hollywood is okay God wasn't doing that to see if he knew whether Abraham was gonna take Isaac or not he was doing it for Abraham he was doing it just for Abraham he wanted Abraham to know himself that at any cost he would even take the life of the promised oh that's the type cuz God knows everything I mean we're always Oh God is not flying by the seat of his pants God is not worried of whether this is gonna work out or not God is really not even contending with the devil the devil is just like one of them puppets well actually it's Pinocchio and his nose gets bigger all the time he just a puppet do we realize that the hardest part for us we see that we see that the devil's a puppet we understand there's a puff of smoke he's a tool in God's hands but can we accept that he is the tool that God is using to extract his own character through you and I it gets a little finer doesn't it but we're always blaming everything No brothers and sisters we've come to the hour where God is expecting sister looked at her watch when I said okay we're coming to the half hour you understand I mean it's time we think the world's gonna go on we got ambitions and we need we need a new house and a new car and we need a bank account and we need retirement and we need I got news for you they can take all that away from you whoop just like that no matter how well you're doing no matter how much money you've got and we look at the rich people and the Kardashians and you know what I'm saying all these people that are really popular new I'm gonna tell you what brother Branham said if they don't get save their cannon fodder I don't want to be cannon fodder there's something in me driving me for the end now brothers and sisters not no different than you matter of fact I may have further to go than some of you've got that's why I tell people I get up behind the pulpit brother Samuel I preach to myself brother I am preaching to myself because I realized that at the very end it's coming down to if you say it's going to go beyond the I so I'm gonna shift gears a little bit here before I begin to read a few things is that all right so let me do this how about turning to Genesis 1 1 through 3 you know when they were as an example questioning Jesus on marriage and divorce which whether you realize that are not brothers and sisters is the one subject matter that is going to make the biggest difference at the end as it did at the beginning because brother Branham said that he said just as the Satan Satan worked the way he did in the Garden of Eden with Adam and Eve Adam being a type of Christ Eve being a type of his bride or church he's going to use that same tactic at the end and whether you realize it or not he's employing it right now it's the natural marriage and divorce that you are focusing on with this I but it's the spiritual marriage and divorce should be concerned with it it's unbelievable how many people are committing spiritual fornication and adultery right now that doesn't mean that I'm preaching to anybody in here I just want you to understand that that is what's taking place people just don't realize it you go outside of God's Word one iota and you are potentially committing fornication and/or adultery with God's Word ouch this is getting pretty tight but the elect cannot be deceived you still with me so let's look at Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without void with without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters now the reason I read that to you and I haven't read verse 3 yet is when they were questioning Jesus on marriage and divorce he would constantly remind them that it was so from the beginning is that right for your Bible readers you know that's correct but then God sends a prophet in the twentieth century and that prophet preaches the message called that spoken word is the original seed right I believe that so what happened before the word was spoken you with me I'll just go slow and easy the spoken word is the original seat so what is the original seat the spoken word well Genesis chapter 1 verses 1 & 2 was before the spoken word because it's in verse 3 he says and God said let there be light so here's what's really interesting to me up to verse 3 there's no time he said oh brother God created where the Prophet taught us in his mind he said let there be light and brother Branham said it could have been a hundred million years and he also said that God had to believe his own word watch this I don't know if I gave the brothers this and I'm sorry if I didn't God's Word calls for a total separation from unbelief pages two and three God was going to use the earth are you earth God was going to use the earth and it was in total darkness oh praise the Lord brother Samuel that's me I didn't know God was gonna use me when I was in total darkness but because he said it it had to come to pass God was going to use the earth and it was in total darkness brothers and sisters I don't know about you but one day I found myself in total darkness what's the use what am I good for what are we doing here what's this what's the future hold what do you know all the questions you compose what what is it I don't know if he worked on you that way but that's the way it worked on me I thought I'd lived a full life when I was 21 years old later salmon you know I'm 21 and a half years old brother and I'm thinking is this it is this all there is to life you mean I've told this story before my wife knows that I'm sitting on my front porch before I got saved after I got off work one day in the summertime and a brand-new Cadillac and I lived in the neighborhood where they drove slow really this happened it's driving down the road and there's this really tiny small old lady driving the Cadillac and I said wow that's strange and her husband I suppose he was was in the passenger seat brother and he was all slumped over he couldn't even look over the - he probably had a bad back brother say I mean I don't know or osteoporosis or what I mean really this happened and I watch that cuddle I go by and I seen that little old lady driving it and I seen that man who probably worked all his life to pay for that Cadillac bent over and I said is that it is that what I got to look forward to you mean I'm gonna pound nails for 60 years then be bent over so my wife can drive a Cadillac I mean it that's that God started working on me Ryan didn't know he was working on me right there brother Sammy he was working on me he started to work on the inner man I was in total darkness but I was the earth God was going to use the earth and it was in total darkness listen to this now the Spirit of God spoke out and said let there be light oh but that's not all and he separated the light from the darkness listen this is the kicker and it's been doing that ever since separating light from God did you realize brothers and sisters that what God said skilled doing that right now he's still separating the light from the darkness praise the Lord he's an eternal God he don't stop you know science got their formulas and their scopes and their thing oh no the sense what's the guy that just passed away that was in a wheelchair can't think of his name you know Hawkins Hawking not an eagle oh the sun's got a few more billion years to last and it's over man is only gonna be here another thousand years boy I wouldn't want to be in his shoes right now because if you say sealed his own testimony think about what he said man's gonna be here about another thousand years after the loom there's gonna be a white throne judgment I would hate to be that because what he did essentially is he stopped separating light from darkness it's the age we live in we've got so much information we got so many gadgets we got so much stuff we got so much information oh brother I just read the other day see then it's not a sin for you to read the news but the news is awfully sinful I mean come on there's only any good thing at it but we got the good news did you know that it's intimidated as we are and it's apprehensive as we are in this world we live in the whole world is craving for the good news that you and I got but we're intimidated to share it well oh that's how do we say it that's unpolitical e incorrect that's too negative so that's a positive think about it that's that's what that's the world we live in or so who don't say nothing well it's probably good that you didn't because when they were trying to accuse Jesus of being oh so you say you're the son of God are you didn't have to tell him cuz he knew who he was we don't have to boast not if we know who we are ain't no boasting going on the only way brothers and sisters you and I are gonna know where we are is to go beyond the I you with me should I read the rest of it well I know I have time but the next paragraph page 3 or the next paragraph I got written down on page 4 and when the word of God has been a vindicated the word been a vindicated that is light now the word itself now I want you to catch something you can read it out if you want but I'm gonna preach to you on it so when God said let there be light and that began the process of separating light from darkness the only way it was defined as light was to have it a vindicated here with me okay now the word it's a watch where he goes now the word itself oh oh this shakes people to the core the word itself isn't light did you say that is that up there I don't want you to think I'm making another now the word itself isn't light until it's a vindicated light if God said let there be light and there was no light then it wasn't the Word of God now brothers and sisters think about it think about if it took a thousand years or a thousand million years and God said let there be light and light didn't pop up the minute he said it lucifer began to think he's not God that's the same thing people are doing with the message of the hour well the Prophet said this and the Prophet said that the Prophet said this and they began to take their microscopes and their telescopes and they began to bear down on look I didn't go look man it isn't happening no it's not happening in your life but don't you dare think it might not be happening in someone else's that's the very reason brothers and sisters that people are yearning and burning and crying and praying for the return of the Prophet because they can read the prophets word they can read the message of the hour they can read the prophecies with their eye in the Bible but then after some time and sometimes this happens over a thirty careful brothers and sisters are 40 or 50 year period as we begin to get older and break down and our lives haven't begun or haven't finished producing everything that we see intellectually in the word we go maybe it's not so you know I thought I had the Holy Ghost brother but this ain't happening to me yeah and so what do people do fall back and punt that's what I call it they fall back and they say in in themselves well if I can't produce it somebody's going to watch how close it is now it's so closer to deceive their very elected if I can't do it somebody's going to do it and the only person I can trust is the Prophet I don't trust the Prophet I trust God they use the Prophet do you understand that it's a fine line isn't it who that brother said something that's blasphemous I can tell spiritual you know who that's blasphemy is it I'll tell you what blasphemy is the worship the man and not the Creator to mistake who that man is and it didn't have to be William Branham it could be anybody I like to say it like this how many of you in this room tonight and on the hookup would have believed Isaiah 740 years later come on now I realize we're believers so we'd say well I would have believed it brother Branham said if you lived in the days of Jesus you would have treated him the same way you treat him today and he's the word made flesh not just a benevolent man that hands out cookies gives out money and answered most of us think God is a slot machine we put prayers in we pull the handle and we expect every time my wife we're talking about an incident that happened here to her and I and and she said something to me and I said honey sometimes and I'm not quoting Garth Brooks sometimes the best thing God can do it's nothing do you remember when the Prophet was told by the angel of the Lord listen this is what I want you to do and brother Branham began to get picked on by those guys over an African no no no he could he could have said I'm going home I don't care what it cost but that human nature began to work on him and they began to work on him and they began to say listen man this can't happen without you but you can't go over there and you can and he saw the vision he saw a vision of what he should do and he let those men talk him into something else he nearly cost him his life and he pleaded God please I'm gonna die when he got home he had some kind of amoeba or something I'm gonna die man just God just told you not to do that yeah you didn't listen to me that didn't mean God didn't love him didn't mean God was gonna forget about it that didn't mean God was gonna leave him helpless God was teaching him a lesson have you ever had that happen to you I'm getting better at it brother way Lord Oh garnet I made a bad decision that has cost me the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away now brothers and sisters that's just a phrase to many people but if you've lived it that phrase becomes white you see it becomes a vindicated in you and you become the light of that word you become the manifestation of it and you say wow okay well how about the good part I'm getting to that I got 20 minutes but when light sprung up it wasn't then it wasn't let there be light and there was no light than it wasn't the Word of God Wow that's what money people think because they just don't see it coming to pass I mean it's gotten so bad have you all heard this that brother Branham has to come back because he didn't fulfill Malachi 4:5 you oh yeah he turned the hearts of the fathers to the children but he ain't turned the children to the hearts of the fire you too late what's happening me oh no brother the Seventh Seal hasn't opened oh maybe not to you but it's open to me you want to know I know that because that's our seal we live in the age of the seventh seal it's our seal I'll even take you a little further brother branham said the Holy Ghost is our seal now a lot of people look at it like this because they're linguists and they go well yes that's true the Holy Ghost is the seal and so it makes sense that he would say that because it's the seal of our day no he said the Holy Ghost is our seal personal pronoun possessive but because people think there's nothing left to do what are we gonna do when we get to the other side brother and sister sit around drink iced tea half a cup of sugar to a gallon a cup of sugar to a gallon two cups of sugar to the gallon that's southern tea out west we'd all be dying of sugar diabetes think about it we all think oh when we get to the other side what do you think you're gonna do when you get over there okay it's there's no end so you're just gonna lay down and sleep for eternity I want you to understand the God we serve he has no end therefore there's no end to revelation it's just that you and I are finite beings we're trying to think what are we gonna do when we get there I was witnessing to my cousin and he likes Harley Davidsons and he said if they're in Harley Davidson heaven I ain't going he'd said that and I'm thinking in my mind of course I'd I really didn't know exactly how to answer that back but I'm thinking in my mind well I guess if you want a harley-davidson that bad God will let you have one but why in the world would you want one they I'm a motorcycle mechanic and a bike racer before I was saved and Harley Davidsons we're always broke down on the side of the road dripping oil all over everything who was one of those well I'm with you brother first motorcycle I ever had I pushed it way more than I ever wrote it those that's true but see God used those instances in my life to let me get this far down the road and the look in his word and say wow there's way more to this than meets the eye we got to stop looking around for what we want to see and we got to put on the mind of Christ that mind is so powerful that if God lets me finish tonight you'll see that God is going to use you and I to do something that no one else has ever accomplished and I'm gonna say I know this is gonna woo this is a curveball coming in here we're gonna do something that not even the man Christ Jesus did know blaspheme brother I know well you know what I mean that people are the prophet of God said that Jesus himself did not know the seventh seal didn't he well you and I live in the hour where you can now that is not impugning Christ Jesus it's to understand that he was God manifest in the flesh but that part of God that he was going to keep secret from everybody every angel even his own son why why brother Samuel was he gonna keep it from his own son because a son had a beginning and there was part of him so that's why the son couldn't know it because that part but the God in the son all he knew the beginning from the end he had no beginning and he had no heir you know that Melchizedek that was living in him but Jesus was also a man he was a human being like you and me I mean you think well okay so he's the second Adam yes think about this brother Branham says in the spoken word is the original seed that while Adam was the god of the earth he did not know how to produced the promise of replenish and multiply it's in the spoken word as the original seed you can read it yourself he said Adam hadn't come to that yet but because Satan was using the serpent and the serpent was already multiplying cuz he was a beast he was an animal but he had a place for a soul brother branham taught us we would have never known had it not been for the detail we would have never known there were people I've heard before brother Branham ever came on the scene that would preach the Serpent's seed but without revelation because they didn't have the detail they understood that much of the blueprint but they didn't have the detail the serpent had a place for a soul because he was made so close like mankind brother Branham tells us in questions and answers in genesis that that man was a beast genesis 2:7 we know that we know he's animal life so here's the serpent over here bringing forth the promise of God the commandment of God replace your multiply bring forth after your own kind and Satan enters in to the Beast and he begins to use him and that beast begins to talk to the church listen Eve tell me again what God said half God not said tell me again what he said listen to that tape over and tell me what you think so so she she sees she gets the Word of God on it she says well he said replenish and multiply it and I'm gonna tell you what tactic the serpent used of course it was the devil he said um where's your children sly is wait how come you're not producing this is a commandment and a promise of God and you're not producing it isn't the devil sly isn't he telling you and I that we listen to the message we read the Bible we listened we read the message we listened to it and we're in in the devil's got you said you see you're not exactly all the way there yet because you're not producing of these signs shall follow them that believe brother wait and I were talking about that today we'll just get somebody hire them and put a sign that's the way we think we will have signs and wonders and miracles following us oh I believe in signs wonders and miracles I'm gonna tell you all something you're looking at one right now if I told you the story of my life you would think I was the biggest liar that ever walked the face of it I have been in accidents I have been I have had a gun put to my forehead and the trigger pulled you see a scar it didn't go off and you could tell me things that have happened to you through your life and Satan begins to say you you you you you ain't got it you've walked down this road so far and you're not producing every word of God that's what the Serpent's here's a promise look what we're doing and you're not doing it I hope you get this if you don't you meditate on it you think about it and you see if it doesn't work the way that God is ministering it to you that old black dog is constantly whispering what about and then if if you love your brother and you love your sister and you realize that love covers a multitude of sin then it begins to work on you what about you Jobe had already taken care of business and the devil got a little bit upset and man this ain't working I guess God might be right in this instance a man is just a little bit more than I thought that I could handle so we went back went back to God and said okay one for you zero for me but I got another plan I'm gonna attack him from a different angle if you'll let me and God said all right you got to do this again go for it and he used job's friends family his church come on his wife that's the type of church use the church it was recently that some brothers that my wife knows of that I'm speaking of came to me and they said well we're gonna leave our church and we're gonna go to this other Church and and we're well we're gonna do this our own bang and blah blah blah and I said okay okay hoho let's go out to lunch let's sit down let's talk about this okay so let me ask you this question and I did I said are you leaving the church because the pastor's off the word you're not gonna believe what they told me brother wait they said no we're not leaving the church because the pastor is off the word oh I knew right then the devil was working I said then tell me why if the man's not off the word I better be careful you better be careful that's all I'm saying oh no brother there's not enough action going on did you all realize that brother branham never one time said give it the spirit test not once What did he say give it the word test do you know why because the life that you and I are looking for is not out in the universe it's in the word but that life has to be activated how by bringing it to pass that's where you and I come in oh I got ten minutes left I better go I'm gonna put that aside then well cut to the chase in the message and I know this just blows me away the way these come in the word became flesh you know it as the India report y'all know I know I'm not teaching babies here what is a word he says a word is the manifestation of a thought I'll get him it's an expression of a thought then he asks this question is that right is he just asking me or is he asking you is he asking the congregation is that right the congregation says right here before you say anything subconsciously you think it before you speak it is that right that's why I read Genesis 1:1 and 2 to you cuz he spoke yet it was in his conscience he says so in the beginning was the word that's as far as we can go back by this by theology but before the word was in was a thought and a thought was made manifest he says you see what I mean first he thought and he spoke the word and the Word was made manifest oh how infallible God is notice every thought when it's spoken a little lower down he says every word in the Bible is God's thoughts laying in seed form that if received into the human being and spoke by the same thought that materialized the Bible brings the thing to pass see what I mean how powerful could the church be the Bible said let this mind that was in Christ being you as a man thinketh in his heart so is he now your thoughts if they become expression he says like God said let there be a world before it could be a word it had to be a thought so God and the creation created the world by his thought and the thought expressed became material he says see what I mean now if that same spirit that said let there be light and then he said pauses he said and there was light and said let there be trees and there was trees and if that same mind that was in Christ being you how much could it I like the way says it he doesn't say how much could you say he says how much could it say let there be no cancer I'm reading what he I let there be no cancer and it would be gone now brothers and sisters if you apply that same principle to anything going on in your life I don't care if it's sickness or material a relationship or church or neighbor or worker whatever it is because I'll tell you what in this day and age a lot of things can happen to us but when the word cancer comes up you know I've known a lot of people that have gotten cancer and their entire life has changed they don't care about nothing else but living and if God permits them to overcome the cancer they're different because they say they got a second chance you ever heard that listen now let the blind eyes be opened and it would be so there this is the last sentence it's your thought Jesus said I'm going to I want to read to how powerful the the mind of Christ is in you a human being can be changed from a pig to a lamb because he's got a soul made in the image of God his thoughts change something does it for him hallelujah that's a man thinketh in his heart see Christ the Creator come to him in a steel form and created his own spirit took the man's natural way to love dancing and the world and carrying on and from that time he just laid it aside and was hungry after God and God was in him all the time I didn't say he said but I believe it cuz I can see it it was God in the beginning see there you are a man as a man thinketh it has become a thought before it can become a word and a word expressed materializes I believe in my heart that I am a Christian because I have accepted the Lord Jesus Christ if I don't cry if I don't move if I don't do a thing in my heart first I believe that Christ died for me in my stead amen I accepted as a Christian I believe it as a Christian then it's in my heart then I express it in a word watch how powerful this is I am a Christian that's the expression in a word living as a Christian being as a Christian and by my fruits I'm recognized by the world as a Christian hallelujah says we are Christians by faith it's beyond the eye all right I got four minutes left I like to be obedient hang on I don't have to read that to you cuz you already know that let me read this with you y'all know these I'm not reading anything you don't know I'm just kind of like Jesus on the road to emmaus I'm kind of like Peter you know what Peter said I I got to remind you of the things that you already know Jesus had went back to Genesis and began to talk and walk with them and remind them of all of the thing old fools and slow of heart to believe not all that the prophets and he went back and he began to teach them from the beginning and brought them up they already knew all that stuff they just forgot yeah they just they just lost it somewhere along the way and what was really amazing to me is that was Jesus Christ walking with her that was the very word made flesh walking with Him and they still didn't recognize it right because they were busy trying to figure out what happened in Christ is the mystery of God revealed this is on page 15 of this version because there are different publications now God's great secret mystery God now God's secret mystery he had before the world began now back in the back part of God's mind guess what the reason why it's for you and I the reason God kept this all that time for you and I is simple because the first shall be last so this was in the very back part of God's mind it was the very last thing but it was the first it was the first thing that God decided to do to bring his plan to pass in the back part of God's mind we all know that when Moses said Lord I'd love to say it up do you really want to see me oh yeah I want to see you face to face there Moses take a look and the theologians have been scratching their heads for millennia what in the world why would he not show his face well in a way he was but it was by revelation it was hidden it was the great secret that God hid in the back part of his mind he was only showing Moses where he kept it fast-forward to you and I here we are today there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve so he so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed we all know this but brothers and sisters the reason why that it's come to a day where we're struggling is because we we need to realize that it's up to you and I to manifest it we're not waiting any longer on anybody else is there any more Elijah's coming well there's one more coming of Elijah I like what brother Mike price says I don't read in my Bible where it's Elijah four-point-five he comes five times and the next time he's coming now you can argue all you want if whether that's William Branham or Elijah himself but I believe it's Elijah himself because he lied to him something and he's got to couldn't find Moses but Moses knew where to find God that's why God saved him to the end because he already showed him the backside of his plan it's just that Moses didn't have the details we're reading the details right now you and I have access to things that no one else has ever had access to because God kept it in his mind page 31 and then comes the revelation of the mystery see now it has to be a revelation even though it's still a mystery what do we know about a mystery reading your Bibles in Matthew 13 if that right isn't that where brother Branham gives Scofield's definition of a mystery what is there a supernatural element still remains despite the revelation and we can the revelation of the church age is the revelation of the seven seals the revelation of this the revelation of Jesus Christ yes but there's still a supernatural element did you realize that's what the part you and I make up because this is supernatural no man can come up with this pardon me but oh please stand please stand yeah I'm not done yet but I want him to stand it's tough sitting there all that time but I'm closing and I'm not brother Jewell and then comes the revelation of the mystery to the to reveal what it's all that's a ll all been about where these little doctrines like Luther brought out catechism and everything else and Wesley brought out this that and the other and these other things he's talking about the day we live in and then Pentecost brought organization just the same Father Son and Holy Ghost brothers and sisters do you realize that many of the people that you commingle with in what we call the endtime message is a Trinitarian oh yeah they think gods up there and their brother branham is Jesus Christ and then the other guys is prophet I'll just say it like that oh hey you haven't run into their mean like a pit bull you know right away that's not the Spirit of Christ because even if you're correct you ain't gonna approach nobody that way you know our brother told me brother Samuel is come to me just now a brother that I know was personal friends of brother Branham he's still alive barely and he told me brother he said it's so true what Billy Paul said and I'm not impugning Billy Paul so don't nobody shut me down that you didn't know whether people were brother branham's enemies or friends have you ever heard that and when the brother was telling me that I got her revelation by the way I said then brother you didn't know if you was his friend or his enemy because you understand if you couldn't tell his enemies from his friends then who were you and to me that's like whoa then come back in the last days and pick up all these mysteries and clearly explain it reveal it why it's all the last days when this great mystery that God had in his heart is being revealed wait a minute I got one more then I'll close page 34 what was once God's great secret you all know this great mysterious secret in his mind he's now put in the hearts of lovely livre oh come on that's you and me aren't we believers I am and you say well brothers in man I'm lagging behind here because I'm not picking up on this oh maybe it's still in the form of a seed yeah cuz God's Word is always hidden in seed for he says he's now put in the hearts of the believers and that is the body of Christ that's you and me let me go one more place all right thank you I'm coming watch this Christ is revealed in his own word now it's in the eye this is where I got this message from it's in the eye prophetic do you believe it I believe it this was 1965 the Prophet had not passed off the scene yet so this is a true statement it was the prophetic it was the eye but prophet is not here today and people are arguing in and dickering and bickering and and causing divisions and schisms over what the Prophet meant cuz we all got what he said right here in black and white but they're missing the details is that right he says Malachi 4 and so forth there's nothing else left for it to come but him himself to step into that there is more than the it's the life of Christ stepping into the mystical body and raising it down through the ages did you know that I'm preaching to you tonight that that's your responsibility the whole Creole creations groaning its moaning for the manifestation sons of God watch this down a little further because I know I'm running out of time he says God how can a man foresee these things he can't do it it's God himself see it's it's becoming to a place and he's governed the body all the way through then the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride isn't that you and me I accept it I don't know why you wouldn't want to accept it that was taken out of his side like Adam did at the beginning now it's in the head time you can't see with your hands that's why I titled this is there anything beyond the eye ah there's one thing there's one thing beyond the eye and you'll have to have the mind of Christ in order to get it he says you can't see with your hands yet it's a part of the body I love the way says this brother wait watch he doesn't say you can't hear with your ears he says you can't see with your ears yet it can hear you can't see with the nose yet it smells you can't see with the lips though it speaks see that was the Pentecostal age but now it's in the eye time the seeing see now there isn't one moving faculty beyond the eye it's he says it's that right the next is the intelligence which is Christ itself who controls the whole body what is the hope of glory I wanted to entitle my message glory has a hope what is the hope of glory does anybody know Christ in you that's where we're at today brothers and sisters we got to quit playing around with ourselves he says no moving motion beyond that oh brother wait when I read that I Lord in my mind go the seventh seal the opening of the seventh seal I don't need to read it till you can read it to yourself at the end of the seventh series that's nothing moved nothing well that's simple that's because there's no moving part beyond the eye but you have an intelligence I have an intelligence are you thinking right now might be real quiet are you thinking right now I don't hear any hum as a matter of fact brother band said I don't hear the earth spinning around I don't hear the dew being drawn off the leaf in the morning by the Sun but it's happening nonetheless what is doing it what is holding the earth in its place what is spinning the earth around with no noise what is drawing the the dew from the leaves the intelligence that's what we have said to that man he said if you can tell me put a bucket on that fence post if you can tell me what intelligence tells that Sat to go down into those roots I'll tell you who told me that woman was gonna live it was the intelligence of God it wasn't a man it was God using the man in the office of the eyes now you and I can't see a thing without looking through the message of the art right we ain't Weir's blind as a bat without looking to the message of the hour but as we're looking through the eyes of God it takes the intelligence to begin to open that word up to you or you're just gonna become a theologian that argues with everybody a know-it-all isn't that the day we live in everybody knows everything oh brother I got the same quotes in the same Bible in the same book and the same message in the same but do you have the same intelligence yes let me get to one more thing I'm sorry I'm taking longer than I should last year I took less time than I should so I'm even in it out not on purpose brother Samuel now there isn't one moving faculty he says beyond the eye the next is the intelligence which is Christ itself who controls the book whole body no moving motion beyond that's everything else has moved he says but after the eyes there's nothing moves that's the Seventh Seal that's the third pole what is the third pole the opening and revealing of the word listen to this now this is in the message Revelation book of symbols and I'll stop many shall run to and fro the people that know their God shall do exploits in that day God's revelations to his church set still sets still little flock he says positionally stay where you are don't worry God is waiting and trying and pressing can you believe this brother Wade God is putting forth some effort I'm reading what the promise that God is waiting and trying and pressing to get at the mystery of God reveals to his church that's you and me that's me anyway that's what's a holding back the coming of Christ now and the great millennium is this great supernatural power that really lays dormant in the church brother Samuel when I read the word dormant I went to the dictionary God said look it up dormant fixed stationary marked by a suspension of activity silence there was no movement that's why the Seventh Seal is open to those who it was meant for and it's closed it's omitted to those who aren't supposed to get it how come God opened it in the first place because in order for God to make it accessible he had to open it but when God opened the Seventh Seal he realized by definition of the word open that he was making that vulnerable think about it think about it that's why he had to preach the bridge because he had to temporarily open up himself so that the that the secret that was in him could be access but not by the devil so he omitted it again he closed it but all's we needed was the opening of the Seventh Seal cuz brother Branham said did you realize that if science could invent it make the machine that voices are traveling through this room right now he said they could even pick up the voice of Jesus in one of the quotes so the words of Jesus are passing through this building right now but you have to have the device brother Branham called it a crystal and questions and answers on the seals that's white weight and I were talking about earlier brother Bantam said you here at the Tabernacle this isn't for you just be a good Christian live a good life believe it he said but God when he wants to send it will have something there to receive it so when that part of God was opened up and sent out brothers and sisters did you realize the revelation I'm preaching on right now I couldn't get this I barely made it out of high school and the only reason I made it at schools cuz I played sports but I realize that the revelation of Jesus Christ isn't how smart you learn it is now well-read you it is not intelligent you are it isn't how agitated you are its whether you're open to the information of God passing by the spirit through the room you with me all right there's more but i'ma stop yeah thank you god bless you there's there's much much more for you to access it's not just one guy getting up here and preaching a message it's all of you taking this so serious and you know what I've said this you think I'm wrong I'm okay with that but I want you to prove it I want you to go home get your Bible get on your knees get your message out I want you to read and I want you to study I want you to pray about it and call me and if you got a point that I don't see I listen to you because I know this brothers and sisters every single believer that God is elect in the hour we live in is going to receive oh the word because somebody's got to do it let's pray father Lord we just this word father just needs to take life in it's Lord we need to become the light so we can be the event ocation of it father we realize that Lord intellectually Lord we hear it with our ears we see with our eyes but we realize there's something beyond the odds and it all boils down to the mind of Christ if we say you showed us Lord in a in a glimpse the prophet of God said there were people that were crippled there was a prayer list miles long and there were interviews that had been months and years out and he's out hunting squirrels and you ask him what he wants what are you doing well I'm squirrel hunting he said what do you have need of haven't seen a squirrel and then he paused oh that's it that's what I have right now right here this very moment I'm out squirrel hunting he said I'd meet a squirrel how many you want brothers and sisters as our heads are bowed and our eyes are closed that's what God is asking us tonight what do you have in need of right now because if by faith which is beyond the eye because it's the evidence of things not seen you apply God's Word to your need it has to come to pass we just need the patience to wait bless your children Father for their efforts thank you Father for permitting an audience Lord that would pull those things which you've ordained father for this hour to themselves help me Father forgive me if one feeble word passed my lips Lord if there was one thing that wasn't edifying father I pray as we enter into the New Year father that you'd forgive me use me and each and every person father at the sound of this voice father to edify to further and to benefit your kingdom for your honor and your glory we ask it in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord thank you god bless you thank you brother sweaty right there you Jesus I believe that part could we're in the very intelligence we're in the intelligence not just a part of word that we're hearing this part or where the shoulders would it this is the last day we're in the intelligence it's a finished product and all this done sure you tell our brother how much you appreciate it let's just sing a song or two and then we'll go into the singing we got a little time going into the
