[1:00] go to the word this
[1:02] afternoon
[1:03] we're gonna read from acts chapter one
[1:07] acts chapter one
[1:12] while we're turning there
[1:13] and the brothers are bringing it up we
[1:15] just want to thank god for
[1:16] this past weekend services
[1:19] appreciate what the lord how the lord
[1:21] spoke amen i believe he was trying to
[1:24] go through a certain avenue amen
[1:28] if you notice even there at the end
[1:29] brother mike ulti kind of got off his
[1:31] notes there on sunday and just started
[1:33] something was pulling him or someone was
[1:35] pulling him
[1:37] so
[1:39] god god is it god is mindful of each and
[1:41] every one of our needs spiritually
[1:44] praise the lord so
[1:46] he is a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:48] the intents of the heart
[1:50] he knows what you came to church for
[1:53] he knows what you what's really in your
[1:55] heart
[1:56] and he will be able to discern that i
[1:58] don't know brother wade doesn't know
[2:00] brother dale doesn't know
[2:02] none of us know but he knows
[2:04] and he and he can speak to us directly
[2:08] to that need whatever you have need of
[2:10] this evening god is god knows
[2:13] praise the lord and that's a comfort to
[2:15] me
[2:16] knowing that we have a god that knows
[2:18] all things
[2:19] when we have no control of some things
[2:21] there's some things that we have no
[2:22] control of
[2:24] but he's in control
[2:26] and all he wants is if we could just
[2:27] give it over to him
[2:29] amen that just releases a burden from us
[2:32] and it it it helps us to just say i'm
[2:35] free thank you jesus
[2:37] and when he does the work as i've always
[2:39] said when he does the work he does it
[2:41] right
[2:42] when we get our hands in it and try to
[2:43] do our own you know in it it comes out
[2:46] wrong
[2:47] but when he does it and you just release
[2:49] let go
[2:50] and let god have his way whether it be
[2:52] for your children whether it be for your
[2:54] family whether it be for your sickness
[2:56] amen and god is going to do it and it's
[2:58] going to do the work right
[3:00] i'm so thankful that we serve a god like
[3:02] that amen
[3:03] praise the lord jesus let's uh let's
[3:05] read in acts chapter one
[3:08] and um
[3:09] you know we've been we just celebrated
[3:11] easter and we we celebrated the uh the
[3:14] resurrection of the lord jesus christ
[3:16] and and when we and as we're certainly
[3:19] thankful for that and we appreciate the
[3:21] lord for
[3:22] for what he did because that needed to
[3:24] happen it was for an example to us amen
[3:27] who i mean god can't stay dead
[3:31] amen uh he's god he's he's the author of
[3:35] life amen so he must needs come from the
[3:39] tomb but i wanted to i wanted us to look
[3:41] at just a little bit of the things that
[3:43] happened after the resurrection just
[3:46] shortly after the resurrection and
[3:48] there's some interesting things that
[3:49] took place so that's why i call this the
[3:51] 40 days after the resurrection
[3:53] and then just because the bible tells us
[3:55] that jesus was with them about 40 days
[3:58] and we're going to read here in in acts
[4:00] chapter one and there were some things
[4:02] that took place and some and some uh uh
[4:04] some interesting uh events that took
[4:07] place one of the things that i want you
[4:09] to concentrate on is that he was always
[4:12] appearing
[4:13] there was always a seeing there was
[4:15] always an appearance there was always
[4:18] whether
[4:20] there was a conflict between faith and
[4:21] doubt
[4:23] amen there was a conflict between do i
[4:25] believe or or not
[4:28] or
[4:29] am i going to continue even though
[4:32] the good the good times are over
[4:36] or am i or am i just going to
[4:38] settle you know
[4:40] and just just relax i'm going to go
[4:42] fishing like peter said
[4:44] i believe a lot of people ever since the
[4:46] the prophet left the scene some of them
[4:48] went fishing and they never came back
[4:52] amen so these things took place in the
[4:55] in the disciples lives
[4:57] and some of the other people that that
[4:58] jesus appeared himself to
[5:01] and uh so we want to look at some of
[5:02] these things through this through the
[5:04] lens of the scriptures we're just going
[5:05] to just kind of go over some some
[5:07] scriptures i'm i'm not going to keep you
[5:09] long tonight but uh and then afterwards
[5:12] we're gonna i'm gonna show you some uh
[5:15] some updates some missionary updates so
[5:18] it won't we won't we won't be too long
[5:20] so
[5:20] let's um let's read acts chapter one it
[5:23] says the former treaties have i made o
[5:26] theophilus of all that jesus began both
[5:28] to do and teach
[5:30] until the day in which he was taken up
[5:32] after that he through the holy ghost had
[5:35] given
[5:35] commandments unto the apostles whom he
[5:38] had chosen
[5:40] to whom also he showed himself
[5:43] now verse 3 says to whom also he showed
[5:46] himself alive after his passion
[5:49] by many infallible proofs so there were
[5:52] many infallible proofs that took place
[5:54] after his resurrection
[5:57] being seen of them 40 days
[6:00] and speaking of the things pertaining to
[6:03] the kingdom of god
[6:04] so jesus was was still about
[6:07] teaching about the kingdom of god amen
[6:10] and we know the kingdom of god is the
[6:11] holy the holy ghost amen
[6:14] and being assembled together with them
[6:16] commanded them that they should not
[6:18] depart from jerusalem but wait for the
[6:21] promise of the father which saith he
[6:24] ye have heard of me
[6:26] for john truly baptized with water but
[6:28] ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost
[6:31] not many days hence
[6:33] when they therefore were come together
[6:36] they asked of him saying lord will thou
[6:38] at this time restore again the kingdom
[6:41] to israel
[6:42] so they were still carnally minded
[6:44] thinking that the kingdom was something
[6:46] physical something tangible somebody was
[6:49] going to come in and destroy the the
[6:51] romans and kick to take them out of
[6:52] jerusalem kick them out and jesus told
[6:55] ministry was not about that it was
[6:57] trying to preach to them a a spiritual
[7:00] kingdom when they therefore let's see
[7:03] okay verse 7 and he said unto them jesus
[7:05] said unto them it is not for you to know
[7:07] the times or the seasons which the
[7:09] father hath put in his own power
[7:12] but ye shall receive power
[7:15] after that the holy ghost has come upon
[7:17] you so he takes them away from the
[7:19] thought of hey stop thinking about that
[7:21] this is what you need to be concentrated
[7:23] on that the holy ghost has come upon you
[7:26] and ye shall be witnesses unto me both
[7:28] in jerusalem
[7:29] and in all judea and then samaria and
[7:32] unto the uttermost parts of the earth
[7:34] and when he had spoken these things
[7:37] while they beheld he was taken up and a
[7:39] cloud received him out of their sight
[7:41] and while they looked steadfastly toward
[7:43] heaven as he went up behold two men
[7:45] stood by them in white apparel
[7:48] now
[7:49] we'll we'll look at something there in
[7:51] just a moment but verse 11 which also
[7:53] said ye man of galilee why stand ye
[7:55] gazing up into heaven the same jesus
[7:58] which is taken up from you into heaven
[8:00] shall so come in like manner as ye have
[8:02] seen him go into heaven
[8:04] then return day unto jerusalem from the
[8:06] mount called olivet which is from
[8:08] jerusalem a sabbath day's journey and
[8:11] when they were come in they went up into
[8:13] an upper room where abode both peter and
[8:16] james and john and andrew philip and
[8:19] thomas bartholomew and matthew
[8:22] james the son of alphaeus
[8:24] and simon zelotes and judas the brother
[8:27] of james
[8:28] these all continued with one accord in
[8:31] prayer and supplication with the women
[8:34] and mary the mother of jesus and with
[8:36] his brethren
[8:37] praise the lord and then uh just one
[8:39] more scripture
[8:41] taking advantage while you're still
[8:42] standing
[8:44] first corinthians chapter 15
[8:47] verses 3 to 8
[8:48] paul speaking here
[8:51] he says for i delivered unto you first
[8:54] of all that which i also received how
[8:56] that christ died for our sins
[8:59] according to the scriptures and that he
[9:01] was buried and that he rose again the
[9:03] third day according to the scriptures
[9:06] and that he was seen of cephas
[9:09] which is peter
[9:10] then of the twelve
[9:12] after that he was seen of above 500
[9:15] brethren at once of whom the greater
[9:17] part remain unto this present but some
[9:20] are fallen asleep
[9:22] after that he was seen of james then of
[9:25] all the apostles and last of all he was
[9:28] seen of me also
[9:30] as one
[9:31] as of one born out of due time amen

[12:21] but we know heaven and earth will pass
[12:23] away but his word will never pass away
[12:26] praise the lord jesus so
[12:28] that's i just want to put my trust and
[12:30] confidence in him amen
[12:32] praise the lord jesus
[12:34] amen so 40 days after the resurrection
[12:39] and if we turn to to john and the
[12:41] brothers can go
[12:42] turn to john chapter 20.
[12:45] i just want to take a look here at the
[12:49] after the resurrection of jesus because
[12:50] john gives us a little bit more details
[12:53] here as to what happened in the
[12:55] different areas and i just want to kind
[12:57] of take a look at the different at the
[13:00] different scenes and and just kind of
[13:03] see
[13:05] take a couple of things from there you
[13:06] know
[13:07] the after
[13:08] is in verse 11 it was when mary
[13:12] magdalene
[13:13] um
[13:15] let's see
[13:16] actually
[13:17] all right so
[13:18] from verse 1 to verse 10 is when jesus
[13:21] when peter and and john they they heard
[13:24] that that you know that jesus
[13:25] resurrected from the dead and they ran
[13:27] to the tomb right and um we see that
[13:30] they that peter outran john and and he
[13:34] he was he was interested in what and
[13:36] what taking place and the bible says
[13:38] there in
[13:40] in verse in verse 8 that
[13:42] then went and also that other disciple
[13:44] which came first to the sepulcher and he
[13:46] saw and believed for as yet they knew
[13:48] not the scripture
[13:50] that he must rise again from the dead
[13:53] after jesus had told them so many
[13:55] several times in the scriptures that he
[13:57] was to rise again but peter
[14:00] and the disciples still couldn't believe
[14:03] the things that had taken place
[14:05] amen that our lord
[14:07] are the one that that we were looking to
[14:09] everything was uh we were having such
[14:11] great wonderful healing campaigns and
[14:13] and such wonderful uh uh services with
[14:16] the lord and and here's the one that we
[14:18] put our full trust in and and now he
[14:21] he's gone
[14:22] and we're looking in the tomb and and
[14:25] and he's gone he's not there
[14:27] all we see was the folded napkin and the
[14:30] and and and his vestures that he was
[14:32] wrapped in
[14:33] amen which that has a significance
[14:35] within itself
[14:37] amen they say that that that that
[14:40] the bible takes uh uh it takes time to
[14:43] tell you in verse six and seven verse
[14:46] seven says and the napkin that was about
[14:47] his head not lying with the linen
[14:49] clothes but wrapped together in a place
[14:51] by itself
[14:53] it took it took time to tell you that
[14:56] so it must be some significance to that
[14:58] i was kind of looking into that and and
[15:00] they say that in jewish tradition that
[15:03] when a servant is serving the king or
[15:06] master of the house that when he sits
[15:08] down and uh when he's done eating or if
[15:11] he's not done eating but he needs to be
[15:13] excused maybe to go to the restroom or
[15:15] something like that he'll put his napkin
[15:17] down and he'll fold it
[15:19] which means that the servant knows not
[15:22] to take his plate
[15:23] not to take not to take his drink not to
[15:25] take his cup and maybe because he's
[15:27] still not finished he's got a work to
[15:29] continue to do amen praise the lord
[15:32] jesus and that's what our lord jesus
[15:34] christ did amen in verse 7 amen he he
[15:37] folded it neatly amen because he wasn't
[15:39] done with his work amen there was still
[15:41] a work amen and i believe that that work
[15:43] is for you and me amen he knew that he
[15:46] had to come amen 50 days later through
[15:49] you through the disciples amen in the
[15:50] form of the holy ghost and to continue
[15:52] that work and i believe he's still
[15:54] continuing that work in this hour saints
[15:57] that's why he folded amen that napkin
[16:00] amen he folded and he took time to do
[16:02] that
[16:04] to show to show amen i'm not done
[16:07] amen i'm not done praise the lord jesus
[16:10] and so the disciples that peter and john
[16:12] they got there and the bible says for us
[16:14] yet they knew not the scripture that he
[16:17] must rise again from the
[16:18] from the dead and verse 10. it says then
[16:21] the disciples went away again unto their
[16:23] own house
[16:26] and i wonder if that's just kind of how
[16:28] we how we are sometimes
[16:31] hey we we haven't experienced we we went
[16:34] to see amen we went we experienced
[16:36] something and then we just kind of go to
[16:38] our house
[16:40] amen
[16:42] and not thinking about what what what
[16:44] just happened
[16:45] not thinking about the scriptures that
[16:46] we just heard
[16:47] not going back home and maybe taking
[16:50] time to to read the scriptures that were
[16:52] just read to us or that you studied or
[16:55] or the sermon or going back and
[16:56] listening to something maybe because i
[16:58] guarantee you you don't get everything
[17:00] in in one sitting
[17:02] amen i appreciate brother ryan and them
[17:04] they they sit down and they they they
[17:08] masticate if you know what masticate
[17:09] means it means to chew
[17:12] amen
[17:13] you continue chewing until you just get
[17:15] all the juice out
[17:17] then you can swallow
[17:18] [Laughter]
[17:22] and according to what they told me they
[17:23] go back home and and they listen
[17:26] because a couple of days later you might
[17:28] get an email or text message from saying
[17:30] hey brother i was listening to you know
[17:32] and it's encouraging amen i appreciate
[17:34] that
[17:35] praise the lord amen
[17:37] something that we should consider doing
[17:38] more often amen including me
[17:41] i i don't do it like i need to do
[17:44] amen but but some but here the disciples
[17:47] they experienced this but here look what
[17:49] happens in verse 11 it says but mary
[17:52] stood without at the sepulcher weeping
[17:55] i mean she didn't go home
[17:57] she started she stood by the sepulcher
[17:59] weeping
[18:00] crying i wonder what she was thinking
[18:03] she was thinking our lord was here our
[18:05] lord jesus was here and somebody went
[18:08] and she was probably thinking somebody
[18:09] took the body
[18:11] we don't know where the body went
[18:13] but but but she's crying and probably
[18:15] thinking and reminiscing maybe of the
[18:17] things that the lord had done for her
[18:20] mary magdalene being one of the one of
[18:22] the ones who i believe had seven seven
[18:24] devils
[18:25] amen and the lord amen
[18:28] cast seven devils out of out of mary
[18:31] magdalene amongst other things
[18:33] amen and she saw and she experienced the
[18:36] the the ministry of the of our lord
[18:38] jesus christ and in the verse it
[18:39] continues and as she and as she wept she
[18:42] stooped down and looked into the
[18:44] sepulchre in other words she was still
[18:46] interested in what was going on in there
[18:50] amen she was still interested amen
[18:54] and then watch in verse 12 and see if
[18:56] two angels in white sitting the one at
[18:58] the head and the other at the feet where
[19:00] the body of jesus had lain amen she was
[19:03] interested she had a true heart a real
[19:05] interest where is my lord well maybe
[19:08] john and peter amen they were probably
[19:10] interested but not interested enough to
[19:12] see two angels
[19:14] but mary amen she stood there weeping
[19:18] amen she stood there because she was
[19:20] interested in where is my lord
[19:22] amen i wonder i wonder if we're that
[19:24] interested in the word of god amen
[19:26] brother branham said amen if if you're
[19:29] interested in god's word if you're
[19:30] talking about god if you want god on the
[19:32] scene if you want angels on the scene
[19:34] amen talk about the word talk about good
[19:37] things amen think on him
[19:39] think on these things as the scripture
[19:42] says
[19:43] praise the lord
[19:44] that's what mary was doing
[19:46] she was thinking and weeping amen when
[19:49] you're really thinking and and praying
[19:51] and meditating on god it's going to
[19:53] cause you to weep
[19:55] i just i i'm not sure i don't know if
[19:58] anybody a a person that's really praying
[20:01] amen in the spirit and and not weep
[20:05] i mean i i believe all of us have come
[20:07] to those those points in our lives where
[20:10] where you cry on unto god amen when when
[20:13] there when it's a real heartfelt prayer
[20:16] but if it's a now lead me down to sleep
[20:18] lord i pray the lord the key lord jesus
[20:20] protect us father god oh lord jesus
[20:22] bless us father god and you know it's
[20:24] kind of like a repetition amen there's
[20:25] no sincerity in that you expect angels
[20:28] to come on the scene
[20:30] don't expect
[20:31] angels to come on the scene
[20:33] don't expect his presence
[20:35] amen
[20:36] when there's not a whole sincerity about
[20:38] it
[20:40] praise the lord
[20:41] and they say unto her look what the what
[20:43] the angel said to her woman why weep us
[20:45] down she said she said unto them because
[20:48] they have taken away my lord and and i
[20:51] know not where they have laid him
[20:54] and when she had thus says she turned
[20:56] herself back and saw jesus standing
[20:59] and knew not that it was jesus
[21:01] now i wonder why she didn't know that it
[21:03] was jesus
[21:04] do you realize that when jesus
[21:06] resurrected amen he didn't resurrect the
[21:08] same way that he that he went that he
[21:10] died
[21:10] the bible says that he he he looked
[21:13] almost a man above 50 years old and he
[21:16] was only in age he was only 33. he was
[21:20] so worn out amen in his ministry that it
[21:22] really wore his body out and he looked
[21:24] older than what he looked like so when
[21:27] mary when mary turned around to see who
[21:30] it was that was talking to him she
[21:31] didn't know that it was him because he
[21:32] was all he was young again
[21:35] amen he resurrected in in in his young
[21:38] self amen and we have that promise
[21:40] saints do you think we're going to see
[21:42] brother ray gabriel and brother dick and
[21:44] and the saints that have gone from for
[21:46] in our family members do you think we're
[21:47] going to see them the same way they went
[21:49] i don't think so
[21:50] i don't expect to see my mother-in-law
[21:52] the same way that that we saw her go
[21:54] amen i expect her to see her young again
[21:57] amen i expect to see her amen in in in a
[22:00] new state amen in the way she i mean you
[22:03] can just kind of look at downstairs and
[22:05] that and the pictures we have sitting
[22:06] over there that kind of gives you an
[22:08] idea
[22:09] praise the lord it'll be better than a
[22:11] picture it'll be a reality
[22:13] amen i'm thankful for that amen because
[22:16] sometimes we forget
[22:18] it it seems like it's fairy tales to the
[22:20] world is fairy tales but it's not a
[22:22] fairy tale because the bible says so
[22:25] amen
[22:26] the bible tells us so
[22:29] and so and so mary thought that he was
[22:32] he was the gardener in verse in verse 14
[22:34] and says and when she had thus said she
[22:36] turned herself back and saw jesus
[22:38] standing and knew not that it was jesus
[22:40] jesus said unto her woman why weepest
[22:42] thou whom seeketh thou she is opposing
[22:45] him to be the gardener saith unto him
[22:47] serve thou have borne him hands tell me
[22:49] where thou has laid him and i will take
[22:51] him away jesus said unto her mary
[22:54] amen
[22:55] she he called her name
[22:58] and it's something when jesus really
[22:59] calls your name amen you know that it's
[23:01] him calling you know when this god god
[23:03] calling amen praise the lord jesus jesus
[23:06] said unto mary she turned herself and
[23:08] saith unto him rabboni which is to say
[23:10] master
[23:12] jesus said unto her touch me not for i
[23:14] am not yet ascended to my father but go
[23:16] to my brethren and say unto them i
[23:18] ascend unto my father and your father
[23:21] and to my god and your god so he tells
[23:23] her to go and tell the disciples
[23:26] mary magdalene came and told the
[23:27] disciples that she had seen the lord and
[23:29] that he had spoken these things unto her
[23:33] amen
[23:35] now in verse 19
[23:36] that was the first appearance that we
[23:38] see there after the lord jesus christ
[23:40] resurrection and it was to mary
[23:42] magdalene
[23:43] of course he appeared to the he
[23:45] he appears amen she was looking for him
[23:48] she was she was seeking amen and he only
[23:50] comes down if you're looking for him
[23:52] praise the lord
[23:54] but now look at verse 19 it says then
[23:56] the same day evening the same day that
[23:59] he appeared to mary in the evening time
[24:02] look what happens then the same day
[24:04] evening being the first day of the week
[24:07] when the doors were shut
[24:10] i like the way the scriptures i mean it
[24:12] it gives detail it lets you know the
[24:13] doors were closed
[24:15] and they were shut
[24:17] amen
[24:18] they were they weren't half open amen
[24:20] they were shut
[24:21] where the disciples were assembled for
[24:24] fear of the jews
[24:27] the disciples were scared
[24:29] of the jews out there amen
[24:32] peter we know peter he even did not deny
[24:34] the lord amen he was scared even from
[24:37] then
[24:38] amen and so they were all crumpled in
[24:41] one room all scared amen and and
[24:44] sometimes that's how that's that's how
[24:45] we are amen
[24:47] after we have experienced some the
[24:50] greatest things i mean the lord jesus
[24:52] amen doing some wonderful things in our
[24:54] midst in the last 40 50 years amen and
[24:58] and now we're we're we're full of fear
[25:00] and and cramped amen
[25:02] and and not knowing what to do what
[25:04] what's next
[25:06] amen
[25:07] but god knows what's next
[25:10] and all he asked us was to look to his
[25:12] word
[25:13] look to his promises amen
[25:16] and they were assembled for fear of the
[25:17] jews and then look what happens came
[25:20] jesus and stood in the mist
[25:23] with the door shut
[25:25] in other words he appeared in front of
[25:27] them and saith unto them peace be unto
[25:30] you
[25:31] amen this is the first thing he tells
[25:33] them
[25:34] amen and that's what that's what i want
[25:36] to say to you saints amen peace be unto
[25:38] you
[25:40] amen
[25:42] you might be fearful you might you might
[25:44] not know what's going to happen amen but
[25:47] peace be unto you
[25:49] amen
[25:50] peace is what he has peace is what he is
[25:53] what he can give
[25:54] amen you may not understand everything
[25:56] amen you you might be fearful of of
[25:59] covet you might be fearful of what's
[26:00] going on around the world amen but peace
[26:02] be unto you
[26:04] amen do you you know that we are the
[26:06] people of peace
[26:08] amen
[26:10] that's why satan tries to rob our peace
[26:13] because we're the only true peacemakers
[26:15] in this world in this life
[26:17] amen there's no there's no peace between
[26:20] kings and and between israel in hamas
[26:23] and and and all that
[26:25] that all just goes away it dissipates
[26:27] amen
[26:28] but we are the true peacemakers amen
[26:31] because we have the peacemaker in us
[26:34] praise god
[26:36] praise the lord jesus not the pacemaker
[26:38] amen the peacemaker
[26:40] amen
[26:41] praise the lord
[26:42] we are the true peace and when he had so
[26:44] said jesus said
[26:46] he showed unto them his hands and his
[26:49] side so as soon as he said peace be unto
[26:52] you he gives him the sign
[26:55] amen he was interested in them knowing
[26:59] that that was him
[27:02] amen and i want you to understand
[27:04] tonight that he is interested in your
[27:06] problems
[27:08] he's interested in what you're going
[27:09] through
[27:10] he he's interested in in your situation
[27:14] amen
[27:15] and he gives signs and he gives amen his
[27:18] sign his daily sign amen as we'll look
[27:20] here in just a moment amen it's his word
[27:24] the message of the hour that he's given
[27:25] us in this day amen is constantly with
[27:28] us he is the word
[27:30] that's why he said i'll be with you even
[27:32] in you
[27:33] amen praise the lord blessed are those
[27:35] who who who have who have not seen but
[27:38] yet believed
[27:39] i've never seen a miracle in my life
[27:42] as far as
[27:43] seeing the dead rays or or or or
[27:45] somebody instant instantaneously healed
[27:48] i've experienced healing in my body i've
[27:50] seen healing in in other people's body
[27:52] amen but i believe that it can still
[27:55] happen
[27:56] he's the same yesterday today and
[27:58] forever
[27:59] amen and blessed are you amen who have
[28:02] not seen those things who have not
[28:04] really experienced amen great amen
[28:07] things that made you know
[28:09] but you still believe
[28:12] that's what he says here to thomas here
[28:14] in just a little bit amen
[28:17] then said jesus to them again peace
[28:20] be unto you
[28:21] i'm sorry let's go back to verse 20. and
[28:23] when he had so said he showed them he
[28:26] showed unto them his hands
[28:28] and his side
[28:29] then were the disciples glad when they
[28:31] saw the lord
[28:34] then said jesus to them again peace be
[28:36] unto you as my father hath sent me even
[28:38] so send i you
[28:40] amen
[28:42] and when he had said this
[28:44] he breathed on them and said unto them
[28:46] receive ye the holy ghost amen
[28:48] now that that that is not that they
[28:50] received the holy ghost right there and
[28:52] then that was a potential amen that was
[28:54] that was the promise amen
[28:57] and they had to go to jerusalem to
[28:59] actually receive that promise amen
[29:02] whosoever sins ye remit they are
[29:04] remitted unto them and whosoever sins ye
[29:06] retain they are retained now it's
[29:08] interesting that they say this that he
[29:10] says this to them
[29:12] before thomas came on the scene
[29:16] you know
[29:17] because thomas look what verse 24 says
[29:20] but thomas one of the twelve called
[29:21] didymus was not with them when jesus
[29:24] came when jesus was in that room thomas
[29:26] wasn't in there
[29:27] amen
[29:28] now some of us we criticize thomas
[29:32] we think i'm doubting thomas old
[29:33] doubting thomas
[29:35] you know
[29:37] because look look what the look what the
[29:39] verse 25 says the the other disciples
[29:41] therefore said unto him we have seen the
[29:43] lord
[29:44] they were excited because they had seen
[29:46] the lord but thomas went and ruined he
[29:48] was he was the one who uh what did they
[29:50] call when somebody comes in and ruins
[29:52] every you know just
[29:54] party pooper
[29:57] thomas was the party pooper
[30:00] he said look what he says
[30:03] but he said unto them except i shall see
[30:05] in his hands the print of the nails and
[30:08] put my finger into the print of the
[30:10] nails and thrust my hand into his side
[30:13] i will not believe
[30:15] maybe he didn't say it with a british
[30:16] accent but
[30:18] i will not believe
[30:25] they were excited because they saw the
[30:26] lord
[30:27] and they saw a sign they knew it was him
[30:30] amen
[30:31] but thomas said
[30:33] if i don't see his the prince of the
[30:34] nails in his hands and if i don't put my
[30:36] finger in his side
[30:38] i'm not going to believe
[30:41] you know and sometimes we criticize
[30:43] thomas for that
[30:45] but thomas was the type of person that
[30:47] he wanted to know that he knew that he
[30:49] knew that he knew
[30:51] he didn't just want to be guessing
[30:53] and that's a good thing
[30:55] that's a good thing there's there's some
[30:56] people there's some of us amen that that
[30:58] that
[31:00] may not get it as quickly as some of us
[31:02] do amen
[31:04] some of us it takes some time like me
[31:06] hey man it takes me a little while you
[31:08] know you just kind of kind of work with
[31:10] me a little bit and maybe then i'll get
[31:11] it my wife could tell you that
[31:14] it takes me a while for me are you
[31:16] listening
[31:18] [Laughter]
[31:21] eventually i'll get it
[31:23] right sweetheart
[31:24] [Laughter]
[31:28] but thomas wanted to know for for a fact
[31:30] amen that the lord amen that they the
[31:33] disciples knew what they were talking
[31:34] about amen
[31:36] and so and after eight days look what
[31:38] verse 26 says and after eight days so
[31:41] thomas
[31:42] and the disciples they probably had
[31:44] their times during those eight days
[31:46] where like they were barely arguing with
[31:47] each other maybe
[31:49] i'm telling you guys we saw the lord i'm
[31:51] not going to believe it for eight days
[31:54] can you imagine for eight days it was
[31:57] eight days until the lord came back to
[32:00] thomas watch and after eight days again
[32:04] his disciples were within
[32:06] and thomas with them so they were back
[32:09] again hunkered amen in fear in the same
[32:11] room and and jesus christ amen was
[32:16] cared about what cared about thomas so
[32:18] much that he came back eight days later
[32:21] appeared unto them once again
[32:23] amen thomas with them then came jesus
[32:25] the doors being shut and stood in the
[32:28] midst and said peace be unto you
[32:31] didn't tell them anything different told
[32:32] them the exact same thing
[32:34] amen that's why you're saints amen
[32:37] we can't tell you us preachers we can't
[32:39] tell you anything different amen we can
[32:41] only tell you what the word says
[32:43] amen and the word says don't worry the
[32:45] word says don't fear the word says peace
[32:48] be unto you amen
[32:50] praise god trust in him who knows all
[32:52] things
[32:53] praise the lord
[32:55] i don't have all the answers amen
[32:57] they're not all preachers they have the
[32:59] answers god in the word has the answers
[33:01] amen
[33:02] then said he unto then said he to thomas
[33:05] look what jesus jesus now directly
[33:08] speaks to thomas
[33:09] and he says reach hither thy finger and
[33:12] behold my hands and reach hither thy
[33:14] hand and thrust it into my side and be
[33:17] not faithless but believing amen he went
[33:20] directly to the root of the issue
[33:23] right there amen he went straight to
[33:25] thomas and said i know this is what's
[33:26] going on so here
[33:29] and he he he he wasn't concerned about
[33:32] thomas's doubting and about his his
[33:35] what he
[33:36] maybe all the arguing that was taking
[33:37] place in all those eight days in between
[33:39] amen he went to go prove to thomas
[33:41] because thomas was one of his
[33:44] amen god is so
[33:46] mindful of each and every one of us amen
[33:48] he was so mindful of us even when we
[33:49] were out in the
[33:50] world that's why that's why brother
[33:53] brown says that it's god looking for you
[33:56] and not you looking for god
[33:58] amen jesus was looking for them
[34:00] amen because he knew that they were part
[34:03] of him they were one of his and he cared
[34:05] so much about thomas whether he was
[34:07] doubting or not amen that he was going
[34:09] to manifest and rev and let him know hey
[34:13] i am the lord jesus
[34:15] amen aren't you thankful that you serve
[34:17] a god like that
[34:19] praise the lord
[34:22] and verse 28 it says and thomas answered
[34:24] and said unto him my lord and my god
[34:28] amen that was all he needed
[34:30] and you know so so
[34:32] let us be patient with one another
[34:36] you know
[34:37] some some of us may not get it as quick
[34:39] as others
[34:40] jesus was patient
[34:43] patient enough to wait eight days
[34:45] i mean he was already living in eternity
[34:47] a glorified body at that time so eight
[34:49] days wasn't nothing
[34:51] it could have been just less less than a
[34:52] millisecond
[34:55] right to him where he was going through
[34:57] walls and things like that but it was
[34:58] eight days according to the scriptures
[35:00] time had passed amen and and he's
[35:03] mindful he's he's patient
[35:05] i'm thankful that we serve a patient god
[35:08] amen sometimes we we don't understand
[35:10] lord why
[35:13] why is it going this way what did we do
[35:15] wrong what what happened but but god is
[35:17] mindful and god god understands amen
[35:20] just just wait on him he's patient
[35:23] amen
[35:25] have faith in his word
[35:27] amen maybe it's not something you did
[35:31] maybe it's something that he's allowed
[35:32] for to happen
[35:34] so that you
[35:35] amen so it can change you
[35:37] and maybe know something about yourself
[35:39] that you didn't know otherwise
[35:41] amen
[35:43] that happens so many times especially if
[35:46] we have children
[35:48] when we have children we realize
[35:51] some things amen
[35:53] that's that's exactly like me
[35:58] i i act like that
[36:03] yeah
[36:06] you you say you talk that way you
[36:09] yeah
[36:11] so
[36:12] but the lord is mindful
[36:15] the lord is mindful
[36:16] he understands
[36:18] he understands and he he cares about you
[36:21] enough amen to keep letting you know
[36:23] coming back service after service
[36:26] amen
[36:27] and let you know i'm here
[36:30] i'm i'm the son of man
[36:32] amen
[36:33] and
[36:34] and you're destinated to reveal the son
[36:36] of man through your life
[36:38] amen so don't let these other things
[36:40] amen take a hold of you and and tear you
[36:42] down amen just keep believing my word
[36:46] keep believing my word
[36:48] jesus said unto him thomas
[36:51] because thou has seen me thou has
[36:53] believed
[36:54] blessed are they that have not seen and
[36:57] yet believed
[36:58] i love that scripture because i believe
[37:00] that's you and me
[37:02] amen i didn't see the miracles i wasn't
[37:05] living at that time i didn't live during
[37:07] the time that brother branham was here i
[37:09] didn't see those miracles sister cleda i
[37:10] believe you were in some of the services
[37:13] amen maybe some other people some others
[37:15] here saw those things i didn't see him i
[37:18] only heard his word
[37:20] amen the word of god that was enough for
[37:22] me to grab ahold of my heart amen but i
[37:25] believed him i believe the the the the
[37:28] signs i believe the wonders i believe
[37:30] that he steal
[37:31] jehovah rapha i believe that he's still
[37:33] jehovah's shaman jehovah jireh amen i
[37:36] believe that he's still the same
[37:37] yesterday today and forever praise the
[37:39] lord jesus because his word says so
[37:42] amen
[37:44] hallelujah
[37:47] and many other signs why in verse 30 and
[37:50] many many other signs truly did jesus in
[37:53] the presence of his disciples which are
[37:56] not written in this book and i want you
[37:57] i want you to take take a look at that
[37:59] because we're we're getting ready to go
[38:00] to chapter 21.
[38:02] and
[38:03] many other signs that jesus showed them
[38:06] after his resurrection
[38:09] keep that in mind
[38:11] but these are written verse 31 but these
[38:14] are written that ye might believe that
[38:16] jesus is the christ the son of god and
[38:19] that believing he might have life
[38:21] through his name
[38:22] all right now that was several
[38:25] appearances there
[38:26] we also know that he appeared to the two
[38:28] walking on the road to emmaus that's we
[38:30] can just leave that aside you most of us
[38:32] know what happened there now
[38:35] verse chapter 21
[38:38] verse 1
[38:39] after these things after jesus had
[38:42] appeared unto them
[38:44] in that room where they were fearful
[38:46] shut in because of fear of the jews
[38:48] jesus showed himself again to the
[38:50] disciples at the sea of tiberias
[38:54] now this was they were outside of the
[38:55] room maybe they got enough
[38:59] function i guess you could say
[39:01] gumption
[39:02] yes to go out now amen
[39:07] and on this wise showed he himself jesus
[39:10] showed he himself
[39:11] there were together simon peter and
[39:13] thomas called didymus and nathanael of
[39:16] cana in galilee and the sons of zebedee
[39:19] and two other of his disciples so they
[39:21] were all together and simon peter says
[39:23] unto them i go a fishing
[39:26] amen
[39:27] in other words i'm going back to my old
[39:28] lifestyle
[39:30] remember what had just happened in the
[39:32] screw in the previous chapter jesus had
[39:34] showed them many signs
[39:37] probably
[39:38] doesn't tell us how long he was with
[39:40] them in in the room both times that he
[39:43] came in the room but showed them many
[39:44] signs
[39:46] and now after the the excitement had
[39:48] drove had it had winged down
[39:51] oh i don't know he's just not coming
[39:52] back again
[39:54] i'm just gonna go back
[39:56] i'm gonna go back to my music
[39:58] i'm gonna go back to my lifestyle i'm
[40:00] gonna go back to the way things were
[40:02] amen
[40:03] reminiscing on the way things were back
[40:07] in the 80s and 90s and
[40:09] back in the 60s and 70s you know
[40:13] that's what peter
[40:14] i'm just going back fishing
[40:16] they say unto him
[40:18] we also go with thee
[40:21] i ain't got nothing else to do
[40:24] when they when they should be seeking
[40:26] and
[40:27] after many signs
[40:28] praise god are you still with me don't
[40:30] fall asleep
[40:32] amen
[40:33] we also go with thee they went forth and
[40:35] entered into a ship immediately
[40:38] and that night
[40:40] they caught nothing
[40:41] amen you're not going to get anywhere
[40:43] with god amen if you're if you're
[40:45] seeking after your own thing
[40:48] you're looking to do your own thing
[40:49] you're looking to to go back and and
[40:52] live your life amen you won't get
[40:54] anywhere with god
[40:55] amen
[40:56] they went and caught nothing
[40:59] because that's not what they were called
[41:00] for
[41:02] but when the morning was now come jesus
[41:05] stood on the shore
[41:06] but the disciples knew not that it was
[41:09] jesus
[41:10] then jesus said unto them
[41:12] children have you any meat
[41:14] they answered him no
[41:16] and he said unto them cast the net on
[41:19] the right side of the ship and ye shall
[41:21] find in other words if you cast it on
[41:23] the right side of the ship you're going
[41:24] to find fish
[41:26] they cast therefore and now they were
[41:28] not able to draw it for the multitude of
[41:30] fishes
[41:31] so it's almost like the lord saying
[41:33] let's see if they're going to do what
[41:34] happened when i first met them
[41:37] amen when he first came on the scene in
[41:38] their life amen
[41:40] amen and he told them cast the net
[41:43] amen and they did they obeyed and and
[41:46] they caught many fish verse seven
[41:48] therefore that disciple whom jesus loved
[41:50] said unto peter
[41:53] now just just
[41:54] do you all know when the bible says
[41:56] there therefore that disciple whom jesus
[41:58] loved
[42:00] do you know who that is
[42:03] if you don't know that's john
[42:05] because john is writing this
[42:08] but he he he's he's
[42:10] he's so uh
[42:12] he's very humble
[42:14] so he doesn't want to write he put his
[42:15] own name or he doesn't want to say
[42:18] you know that disciple that
[42:20] me the disciple who jesus loved
[42:22] you know
[42:24] he had humility amen
[42:28] therefore that disciple whom jesus loves
[42:29] saith unto peter it is the lord
[42:32] now when simon peter heard that it was
[42:34] the lord
[42:36] he gir his fishers coat unto him
[42:39] for he was naked
[42:41] and did cast himself into the sea
[42:44] amen
[42:46] praise the lord that's what happens when
[42:47] you go out and do your own thing
[42:50] lead you to nakedness
[42:53] you're naked before the lord
[42:55] you're naked before
[42:58] it's it's what it's what you know you go
[43:00] back to that lifestyle amen
[43:02] you go back to doing the things that
[43:04] that that you came out of amen the bible
[43:07] says seven more devils
[43:10] worse than what you had left well come
[43:12] in
[43:13] amen
[43:16] and peter and peter ger his fisher's
[43:18] coat amen he was naked he didn't want to
[43:20] be in the presence of the lord amen all
[43:22] naked
[43:23] amen he got out of the boat when he
[43:25] heard that it was the lord and he cast
[43:27] himself into the sea and put on his coat
[43:29] and the other disciples came in a little
[43:31] ship for they were not far from land but
[43:33] as it were
[43:34] 200 cubits dragging the net with fishes
[43:38] and as soon as they were come to the
[43:39] land they saw a fire of coals there and
[43:42] fish laid there on and bread now
[43:45] is interesting jesus told them go
[43:47] you know cast a net to the right and
[43:49] they pulled out a lot of fish but when
[43:51] they got to the bank there was jesus was
[43:53] already there with fish and bread
[43:56] cooked
[43:58] cooked fish and bread
[44:00] he was joined and i'm the creator
[44:03] i'm the lord jesus i'm the same one that
[44:05] made the fish and the the they fed the
[44:08] ten thousand
[44:09] right the five thousand the ten thousand
[44:12] i was there i'm that same one
[44:13] amen they got up there he told them go
[44:16] get fish and here he is at the bank he's
[44:18] there cooking fish
[44:20] amen and got bread
[44:23] because he spoke
[44:26] he wasn't fishing i believe he spoke it
[44:28] to existence
[44:30] and jesus said unto them
[44:32] bring of the fish which ye have now
[44:34] caught
[44:36] simon peter went up and drew the net to
[44:38] land full of great fishes and 153
[44:42] and for and for all there were so many
[44:44] yet was not the net broken
[44:46] what incredible god that we serve
[44:49] the bible tells us there was a 153 fish
[44:52] exactly
[44:54] i mean it gives us those details like
[44:56] that that's what the lord said in the
[44:59] word amen he numbers the hair in your
[45:01] head
[45:02] he knows exactly how many hair
[45:05] some of us are a little bit easier for
[45:07] him than others
[45:08] [Laughter]
[45:10] amen
[45:14] but he knows
[45:15] brother brahma said you haven't lost one
[45:18] amen
[45:20] all the hair that you've lost amen that
[45:22] has gone down your your your drain sink
[45:24] amen the sink the drain god knows all
[45:27] about that hair
[45:29] and wherever is that right now it's
[45:30] waiting for you amen for you to come to
[45:33] it
[45:34] praise the lord jesus
[45:36] amen
[45:38] jesus said
[45:39] now verse 11 simon peter went up and
[45:42] drew the net
[45:45] to land full of great fishes and 153 for
[45:48] all there were so many yet was not the
[45:50] net broken
[45:52] jesus said unto them come and die
[45:54] amen that's what the lord tells us this
[45:56] evening amen come and die
[45:59] and he's already done all the work he's
[46:01] already did everything that needs to be
[46:02] done
[46:03] just come and dine
[46:05] feast on his word feast on his promises
[46:08] believe his promises just come unto me
[46:10] both
[46:11] those that are tired and heavy laden
[46:13] amen as brother bob has been speaking
[46:15] about lately and i will give you rest
[46:18] i got the answer i i got i got exactly
[46:20] what you need just come come and dine
[46:24] i think we all need to feed on his word
[46:26] more and more he's telling us amen come
[46:29] and die and spiritually
[46:32] we could use more time with the word
[46:34] amen
[46:36] we could use more time eating and
[46:37] feasting
[46:39] and none of the disciples durst asked
[46:41] him in other words they didn't dare to
[46:43] ask him who art thou because
[46:45] knowing that it was the lord they knew
[46:47] it was the lord how did they know him by
[46:49] the fish and the bread that was there
[46:53] amen jesus then cometh and taketh
[46:56] bread and giveth them and fish likewise
[47:00] this is now the third time that jesus
[47:02] showed himself to his disciples after
[47:04] that he was risen from the dead this is
[47:07] the third time so jesus was interested
[47:10] in letting them know i'm with you it's
[47:13] me
[47:14] peace amen
[47:16] be unto you now verse 15.
[47:18] so when they had dined jesus saith unto
[47:21] simon peter
[47:23] simon son of jonas
[47:25] love is down me more than these now i
[47:27] want you to look at the scene here for
[47:28] just a moment
[47:30] because jesus is about to ask him these
[47:32] three questions
[47:34] amen
[47:35] now when when peter was getting ready to
[47:37] deny the lord he was also around the
[47:40] fire
[47:41] warming his hands
[47:42] and here they are here's another scene
[47:44] where they're around the fire again
[47:47] and it was asked three times to peter
[47:50] peter
[47:51] you're one of them i've seen you and he
[47:53] denied the lord three times now he's
[47:56] given the he's the lord jesus is given
[47:58] the opportunity to make that right
[48:01] to let him know hey
[48:03] i've given you a chance you might have
[48:05] denied me three times you might have
[48:07] failed me amen but i'm giving you an
[48:09] opportunity
[48:12] not just one time two times three times
[48:15] amen the lord is a god of many chances
[48:17] saints
[48:18] amen don't think that that he's he's
[48:20] done with you amen if you failed him
[48:22] once amen
[48:24] just come to him and he has he's got the
[48:27] answer for amen he's willing to forgive
[48:31] you can't forgive your own sin
[48:34] you can't save your own self so why not
[48:36] put your trust in him
[48:38] amen why not have confidence in in him
[48:41] and what he's done
[48:42] and why do we celebrate amen easter
[48:45] because we're looking at what he's done
[48:46] for you now what you can do amen to get
[48:50] amen all the singing that you can do and
[48:52] all of that amen he's already taken care
[48:54] of all that the sin trouble for you
[48:58] so when they had dying jesus said unto
[49:00] simon peter simon son of jonas
[49:03] loveth thou mean more than these
[49:07] and he says unto him yea lord
[49:10] you know that i love you
[49:13] he saith unto him feed my lambs
[49:16] in other words he's getting them back to
[49:18] his
[49:19] this is what you're getting you're
[49:20] supposed to be doing this you're
[49:21] supposed to feed my sheep feed my lambs
[49:24] he says unto him again
[49:26] the second time simon son of jonas
[49:28] lovest thou me
[49:30] he saith unto him yea lord thou knowest
[49:33] that i love thee he says unto him now
[49:35] feed my sheep
[49:37] amen
[49:39] and then verse 17 he saith unto him the
[49:41] third time
[49:43] amen simon son of jonas loveth thou me
[49:46] and peter was now grieved in his heart
[49:49] because he said unto him the third time
[49:52] lovest thou me and he said unto him lord
[49:55] you know all things
[49:57] thou knowest that i love thee and jesus
[50:00] saith unto him feed my sheep
[50:02] amen
[50:04] peter as as jesus was asking him these
[50:07] questions peter knew that jesus meant
[50:09] business
[50:11] and what he was asking him amen
[50:14] and he's given him an opportunity amen
[50:16] to make that right around the fire
[50:19] just what he had
[50:20] you know what he had done there when he
[50:22] denied jesus
[50:24] but after that you know we don't hear
[50:25] about crow you know the crowing or
[50:28] anything like that
[50:29] amen
[50:30] jesus was right there with him
[50:32] praise the lord
[50:34] verily verily i say unto thee when thou
[50:36] was young thou girdest thyself and walk
[50:38] us wither thou wouldest but when thou
[50:40] shalt be old thou shalt stretch forth
[50:42] thy hands and another shall gird thee
[50:45] and carry thee whether thou wouldest not
[50:47] this spake verse 19 this bay key signify
[50:50] him by what death he should glorify god
[50:52] in other words he's telling he's telling
[50:54] peter he's telling him listen you denied
[50:56] me i know you denied me
[50:59] i know you denied me but you know what
[51:01] you're going to do
[51:02] it's going to come to a point where
[51:04] you're actually going to die for for me
[51:07] because the bible says there in verse 19
[51:09] this spake he's signifying by what death
[51:11] he should glorify god
[51:13] peter was going to give himself so much
[51:15] amen that he was going to be willing to
[51:17] to die and the and the way the way peter
[51:20] died he was crucified as well but he but
[51:22] but according to history he was
[51:24] crucified upside down
[51:26] because he said i'm not even worthy to
[51:27] be crucified the way jesus up you know
[51:30] the way he was crucified he said put me
[51:33] upside down
[51:34] that's how much he was willing to die
[51:36] for the lord
[51:37] i'm not even worthy of even the way he
[51:39] died
[51:41] from denying jesus three times amen to
[51:44] to to dying for him though
[51:47] in that way
[51:48] amen but i believe this gave this gave
[51:51] peter assurance
[51:55] and verse 20 then
[51:57] and verse 19 it says and when he had
[51:59] spoken this he saith unto him follow me
[52:03] amen follow me
[52:05] then peter turning about see if the
[52:07] disciple whom jesus loved following in
[52:09] other words john
[52:11] john was following him
[52:13] which also leaned on his breast that
[52:15] supper and said lord which which is
[52:17] which is he that betrayeth thee in other
[52:19] words that was it it's going it's saying
[52:21] that that was that was john who was
[52:24] laying on on the on the lord's bosom on
[52:26] that night when they were taking
[52:27] communion and
[52:29] before before jesus
[52:32] was crucified
[52:33] peter seeing him said to saith to jesus
[52:35] lord and what shall this man do
[52:40] and jesus says unto him if if it will if
[52:43] it if i will that he tarry to like come
[52:47] what is that to thee follow thou me
[52:50] in other words peter was concerned about
[52:52] what what john was going to do
[52:55] and the lord tells him don't worry about
[52:56] john
[52:57] don't worry about anybody else don't
[52:59] worry about who's leaving the message
[53:01] don't worry about who's preaching what
[53:03] or what or what who said this or what
[53:05] hey man worry about yourself
[53:07] worry about your own salvation with fear
[53:10] and trembling
[53:12] amen is what jesus is telling him
[53:15] and i believe that's what the lord tries
[53:17] to tell us in this hour sometimes we're
[53:19] such busy bodies
[53:21] we want to know everything that other
[53:22] churches do we want to know everything
[53:24] that goes on amen and we don't worry
[53:27] about our own selves
[53:30] we know how many songs are sung in the
[53:32] air and in all the churches we know what
[53:34] songs what what's preached amen but we
[53:36] don't know we don't know our own selves
[53:38] we don't know where we are spiritually
[53:41] amen
[53:43] so what's that to you
[53:45] jesus jesus told him it sounds like he's
[53:47] being rude
[53:50] was that was that to you peter
[53:53] didn't i just tell you to follow me
[53:56] worry about that
[53:58] worry about following me
[54:01] amen
[54:03] i'll take care of the rest
[54:05] amen
[54:06] then when this saying you're brought
[54:07] among the brethren that
[54:09] that disciple should not die in other
[54:11] words that john was gonna die yet jesus
[54:13] said not unto him he shall not die but
[54:15] if i will that he tarry till i come what
[54:19] is that to you
[54:21] what is that to you amanda how does that
[54:24] affect you spiritually
[54:27] man you worry about your salvation with
[54:29] fear and trembling
[54:30] praise the lord
[54:32] maybe i struck a little nerve i guess
[54:34] just everybody i hear a pin drop
[54:38] amen
[54:41] because
[54:45] you know
[54:49] the more the the more that i go
[54:51] saints
[54:53] the less i want to know
[54:55] about people and about
[54:57] you know
[54:59] you you you don't want to get involved
[55:00] with everything that goes on and
[55:03] everybody's life you know
[55:05] it becomes a burden
[55:08] that's why you know i just you know it's
[55:10] been so nice i've been off facebook and
[55:12] on whatsapp and all that stuff for a
[55:14] while and it's just been wonderful

[55:28] where somebody called you at your house
[55:30] and if you weren't there oh well
[55:32] amen
[55:34] and it feels good
[55:36] i don't think the lord wants us to be
[55:37] burdened with so much notifications and
[55:40] all those things like that i'm just
[55:42] speaking from the heart you know
[55:44] we're just so burdened down and we're
[55:46] burdened down about notific with all
[55:48] these notifications and all these all
[55:50] these things that that

[55:53] message and then
[55:55] 15 minutes later you're on facebook

[56:16] you know
[56:18] if if it's if it's causing you to not
[56:20] walk with the lord if it's hindering
[56:22] your spiritual life maybe it's it's good
[56:24] to get away from it for a while
[56:26] you see if it's bothering if it's
[56:27] hindering you spiritually
[56:30] tick-tock and and all these things amen

[57:30] but if it's keeping you away from god
[57:32] maybe it's not the best thing in your
[57:33] life
[57:36] amen
[57:37] i'm telling you you know we work with
[57:38] technology brother joe and i we work
[57:40] with technology brother richard
[57:43] and the more we the more i mean to me it
[57:45] just gets
[57:47] more boring and more boring
[57:51] because i see where the world is trying
[57:53] to take us with all this technology and
[57:55] it's not good
[57:57] it's not good the
[57:59] these elites and these guys who have
[58:01] these plans for humanity
[58:04] amen
[58:05] it's not a good place where they where
[58:07] they're trying to take us with this but
[58:09] i believe god has taken their plans and
[58:11] used them for different purposes as well
[58:13] but if it's hindering you spiritually
[58:15] amen
[58:16] then maybe it's time to maybe take a
[58:18] fast
[58:20] it's okay your body needs fasts
[58:22] maybe we need technology fasts
[58:25] amen
[58:27] so that we don't know i don't need to
[58:28] know what everybody's doing amen in
[58:30] every church and every area amen that
[58:32] just it becomes overwhelming
[58:35] amen i just want to get closer to god
[58:38] amen
[58:42] in verse 24 this is the disciple which
[58:44] testified through these things and wrote
[58:45] these things and we know that his
[58:47] testimony is true and there are also
[58:51] many other things which jesus did
[58:54] the which if they should be written
[58:56] every one i suppose that even the world
[58:58] itself could not contain the books that
[59:00] should be written
[59:01] amen and a lot of those took place the
[59:04] 40 days after the resurrection
[59:07] and so of course you know we read there
[59:08] in in in acts chapter 1 we know that
[59:11] jesus ascends he tells them to go to the
[59:13] upper room and i will meet you there
[59:16] amen but i believe god was preparing
[59:18] them these these these 40 days right
[59:20] there preparing them so that they could
[59:22] go and not doubt
[59:24] amen they can go to that upper room to
[59:26] receive amen what the lord said that
[59:28] they were going to receive
[59:30] and i believe
[59:31] saints that in the last 50 years you
[59:34] know since the prophets left the scene
[59:36] you know
[59:37] you know maybe maybe we haven't seen
[59:40] much we haven't
[59:41] maybe experienced much
[59:43] uh
[59:44] maybe like the way the prophet was here
[59:46] on scene at that time you know we saw
[59:48] wonderful great things the lord appeared
[59:51] amen
[59:53] but i believe the lord is still here
[59:55] and he's here through his word
[59:58] amen and so blessed are you who have not
[1:00:00] seen but yet believe
[1:00:03] amen
[1:00:04] his appearance has taken place he
[1:00:06] appeared to the disciples many times but
[1:00:08] now it's time for you to just take those
[1:00:10] things and you run with them amen it's
[1:00:14] time for you to go to the upper room so
[1:00:16] so and receive his promise amen
[1:00:19] and and if someone here amen is not even
[1:00:22] sure if they're saved or if they're not
[1:00:23] born again amen tonight is your night
[1:00:26] that you can be
[1:00:27] amen
[1:00:28] if you don't even know amen i'm just
[1:00:31] coming to church and i don't even
[1:00:32] understand what those brothers out there
[1:00:34] are talking about amen you can know
[1:00:35] tonight
[1:00:37] amen one of us will be willing more than
[1:00:39] glad to spend time with you pray with
[1:00:40] you amen talk with you amen but you have
[1:00:43] to desire yourself
[1:00:45] you have to want it
[1:00:47] because god is a gentleman jesus christ
[1:00:49] is a gentleman
[1:00:50] amen he is he doesn't force any himself
[1:00:53] upon you
[1:00:54] amen
[1:00:56] so
[1:00:57] i just wanted to take take those
[1:00:59] thoughts and uh and and just kind of you
[1:01:01] look through them yourself the other
[1:01:03] things that took place
[1:01:04] and uh
[1:01:06] just thought it was interesting what the
[1:01:07] lord did there too in those last 40 days
[1:01:12] all right
[1:01:13] so
[1:01:15] i wanted to give you all an update on
[1:01:18] some of the things that uh
[1:01:21] the brothers could help me
[1:01:27] bring these uh
[1:01:29] pictures up
[1:01:35] i'm kind of scared to even scroll
[1:01:37] through these here
[1:01:39] because i thought that they were going
[1:01:40] to be in order but apparently they're
[1:01:42] they when i downloaded them
[1:01:44] uh they they got in in around the
[1:01:48] the times the months and the
[1:01:50] when when they came in and so they're
[1:01:52] they're ordered according to the date
[1:01:55] but
[1:01:55] we'll just start with this one uh last
[1:01:58] time when when i was given the
[1:01:59] presentation
[1:02:02] um brother nilsson
[1:02:04] but
[1:02:06] from nicaragua he's a pastor there and
[1:02:08] he had asked us if we could help them
[1:02:10] with uh
[1:02:11] with 300 for a roof um for this little
[1:02:15] church here in in an area called waspan
[1:02:18] in nicaragua so um when i got when we
[1:02:22] got back um
[1:02:24] we we sent him 300
[1:02:27] and
[1:02:29] and so
[1:02:30] that that's the church without without
[1:02:31] the roof
[1:02:33] and
[1:02:34] he sent me some pictures again
[1:02:37] don't don't mind
[1:02:39] some of the things are
[1:02:44] here's some of the pictures there from
[1:02:46] the brothers in ohio
[1:02:54] oh my i lost
[1:03:00] anyways the church has put the roof is
[1:03:02] put up
[1:03:04] so we just thank god for that
[1:03:07] amen yes technology right
[1:03:10] let me just go to the actual
[1:03:12] and i just wanted to let you all know
[1:03:14] because you all were part of that
[1:03:17] hey man here's here's the the roof over
[1:03:19] their head now
[1:03:21] uh they put a
[1:03:22] you know 300 they were able to put a
[1:03:24] little metal roof
[1:03:26] so 300 goes a long way
[1:03:29] all right and uh
[1:03:32] here they are
[1:03:42] [Music]
[1:03:53] for your help with that
[1:03:55] praise the
[1:03:56] lord all right
[1:03:59] also um
[1:04:01] if you all remember the the the the
[1:04:03] young
[1:04:04] the young man who i showed a picture of
[1:04:07] uh it was in a hammock
[1:04:09] he was on a hammock he was he was a 40
[1:04:12] year old something and he and he just
[1:04:17] and and the brother
[1:04:18] his dad wanted to make a little room for
[1:04:20] him so it'd be easier to kind of help
[1:04:22] with him so we gave him some money he
[1:04:24] had originally asked for 3 600 bucks
[1:04:28] to create make this room for him with
[1:04:30] with a bathroom and everything like that
[1:04:33] we gave him 1300 while we were there
[1:04:35] then we sent him um
[1:04:37] this is what the 1300
[1:04:39] did
[1:04:41] he was able to have the room that's the
[1:04:42] brother right there that's brother
[1:04:43] cornelio
[1:04:45] and um
[1:04:51] and so if we fast forward here he's
[1:04:54] showing the room there
[1:04:56] and he's got a little hammock in there
[1:04:57] now so we just about a week or two ago
[1:05:00] we sent him another eight hundred
[1:05:01] dollars
[1:05:03] um
[1:05:04] and so to kind of finish put you know
[1:05:07] doors and windows and kind of finish the
[1:05:09] place up a little bit better he still i
[1:05:11] believe needs to have a little bathroom
[1:05:14] or something like that in there
[1:05:16] so um
[1:05:19] lord whalen he you pray for brother
[1:05:21] cornelio he's been very sick
[1:05:24] he's uh he bought the materials
[1:05:27] and uh but he's just been very sick and
[1:05:29] he hasn't been able to complete the
[1:05:31] little work there for his son so
[1:05:34] you just pray for brother cornelius the
[1:05:36] lord to touch his body
[1:05:39] he's uh he he has such a wonderful
[1:05:41] spirit and uh
[1:05:43] and he's praying for each one of us as
[1:05:45] well
[1:05:46] amen so he thanks he thanks
[1:05:49] each and every one of you
[1:05:51] for your prayers and then um let's see
[1:05:55] and then last here i wanted to
[1:05:58] some of you helped with this with this
[1:06:00] work
[1:06:01] but i just wanted to show you all
[1:06:08] this was
[1:06:12] this was a church in in honduras
[1:06:16] by the way the previous video i just
[1:06:17] showed you was in honduras
[1:06:19] this is also in honduras um
[1:06:24] they were praying to have the the
[1:06:26] building so when we left pretty much uh
[1:06:29] things looked like that right there
[1:06:32] alright so that they were just starting
[1:06:34] and
[1:06:36] but some of you
[1:06:37] uh
[1:06:40] some of this uh some of you helped out
[1:06:42] with this
[1:06:43] uh through the funds that you that you
[1:06:46] gave and um
[1:06:48] and so the brothers they started working
[1:06:49] on it and uh
[1:06:52] what we did with that money is we we we
[1:06:55] because brother paula fontaine's church
[1:06:56] is helping them build this church
[1:06:59] but what what our money did was that the
[1:07:02] brother that is dedicated his whole time
[1:07:04] building help him build this we help pay
[1:07:07] for
[1:07:08] help pay him so that he can just
[1:07:10] concentrate on because he has to work he
[1:07:12] has to raise a family so another he's
[1:07:14] going to be leaving he's going to leave
[1:07:16] in his work in order to to work on the
[1:07:18] church so he won't be getting paid at
[1:07:20] his home so what where we came in is we
[1:07:22] gave him some money to uh to take like
[1:07:25] two weeks to to to to build
[1:07:28] and so that's what we did and so that's
[1:07:31] how things looked before
[1:07:33] and then brother uh ellie
[1:07:36] brother ali who we are helping uh we are
[1:07:38] supporting
[1:07:40] um
[1:07:40] this is how the place looks now
[1:07:44] so
[1:07:46] what they did is if you can see right
[1:07:47] there on the on the on the left
[1:07:50] that was that's the church right there
[1:07:51] that that's that's the church where we
[1:07:53] where we married that couple
[1:07:55] and uh we
[1:07:56] and that so that's where it was at and
[1:07:58] so what they wanted to do is they wanted
[1:08:00] to to build right right on it
[1:08:03] and
[1:08:04] to make the sanctuary bigger and then
[1:08:06] also add some sunday school rooms and
[1:08:08] things like that as well
[1:08:10] and so uh
[1:08:12] this is where they were at just a few
[1:08:14] weeks ago
[1:08:16] and uh so i believe that they've i
[1:08:18] haven't gotten any updates from them but
[1:08:21] that's what the brother's been doing
[1:08:22] brother renee brother renee
[1:08:26] that's the work that they've been doing
[1:08:29] i want to ask you all to please pray for
[1:08:30] brother renee
[1:08:33] brother renee's
[1:08:35] brother renee the brother who's working
[1:08:37] on here
[1:08:38] his his brother
[1:08:42] he was working he was doing some work
[1:08:44] and uh he he he grabbed somehow or
[1:08:46] another he grabbed an electrical line
[1:08:48] and
[1:08:50] he's in pretty bad condition so you pray
[1:08:52] for brother renee's brother
[1:08:55] pray that the lord will touch him and he
[1:08:56] sent me a picture of him and he's in a
[1:08:58] uh
[1:08:59] he's in the unit where they have like
[1:09:01] burnt patients
[1:09:02] and stuff and they were not sure if he
[1:09:04] was gonna live or not
[1:09:05] he got electrocuted pretty badly
[1:09:08] so brother renee's taking it really hard
[1:09:10] because he lost the brother another
[1:09:12] brother of his a couple of years ago due
[1:09:15] to a motorcycle accident so he hates
[1:09:18] that he
[1:09:19] he thought that they were going to lose
[1:09:20] this other brother so remember him in
[1:09:22] prayer he's he's got a lot he's there
[1:09:25] trying to work helping finish the church
[1:09:27] and then you know his family there
[1:09:30] getting hurt so
[1:09:32] just remember him and the saints there
[1:09:34] in your prayers so i wanted to just show
[1:09:36] you all those updates and uh
[1:09:39] and just let you know that uh
[1:09:41] your money's still at work
