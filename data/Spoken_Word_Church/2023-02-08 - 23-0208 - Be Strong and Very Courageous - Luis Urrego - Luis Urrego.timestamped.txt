[6:56] that had had a lot some big shoes to
[7:00] fill
[7:01] amen and uh and that was this thing that
[7:05] God told him four different times and
[7:08] the third time the fourth time actually
[7:10] was the people telling him
[7:11] at the end so let's just read about that
[7:14] this evening
[7:15] in Joshua chapter 1. now after the death
[7:18] of Moses the servant of the Lord it came
[7:20] to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua
[7:23] the son of nun Moses Minister saying
[7:25] Moses my servant is dead now therefore
[7:28] arise go over this Jordan thou and all
[7:31] this people unto the land which I do
[7:34] give to them even to the children of
[7:37] Israel every place that the soul of your
[7:39] foot shall tread upon that have I given
[7:42] unto you
[7:43] notice that he says it all in the past
[7:46] because it's already theirs amen as I
[7:50] said unto Moses from the Wilderness and

[8:13] forsake thee be strong verse six be
[8:16] strong and of a good courage For unto
[8:19] this people shalt thou divide for an
[8:22] inheritance the land which I swear unto
[8:24] their fathers to give them amen let's
[8:27] just borrow heads this evening our
[8:29] heavenly father

[8:32] opportunity to open back the pages of
[8:34] your word

[9:30] just have your way here tonight we pray
[9:31] I commit myself now unto you in Jesus
[9:34] Christ's name a amen you may be seated
[9:36] this evening
[9:38] praise the Lord
[9:44] amen
[9:45] good to see Michael here tonight
[9:48] praise God
[9:50] amen good to see all of you here tonight
[9:53] praise the Lord Jesus
[9:55] amen so
[9:56] we see here that in Joshua chapter one
[9:58] and and I encourage you all to uh I
[10:01] encourage you all to to read the whole
[10:04] book of Joshua you know brother Branham
[10:06] many many times especially in the
[10:09] adoption series he he talked about the
[10:12] book uh he would go back to the Book of
[10:14] Joshua and how he would parallel How
[10:16] Joshua parallels Ephesians
[10:19] Ephesians Paul talking about bringing us
[10:23] into uh claiming our our our our
[10:25] inheritance amen what God had already
[10:28] given you amen so Paul amen lays out
[10:31] exactly what that's what he was trying
[10:33] to bring to the Ephesians which of
[10:35] course amen that was for us also in this
[10:38] day it was the letter to the Ephesians
[10:40] but it was a letter for for every
[10:42] Christian praise God and so our
[10:44] inheritance in this day amen is is is is
[10:47] the holy spirit is the Holy Ghost amen
[10:49] praise the Lord Jesus and so
[10:52] just as Joshua here in in at this time
[10:56] amen do you know this you know the the
[10:59] background of what they've gone through
[11:00] Amen to Abraham it was promised a
[11:04] hundreds years before amen that they
[11:07] would inherit a land and they would
[11:09] obtain a land and they would go and take
[11:11] a land and they was promised to him he
[11:13] said I will give you this land and and
[11:16] and that the number of the people that
[11:18] that of your of your descendants will be
[11:21] like the stars and we'll be like the
[11:22] sand in other words uncountable
[11:25] amen and it was a promise that was given
[11:27] to Abraham and Abraham Abraham didn't
[11:29] have to do anything but just say Lord
[11:32] you said it I believe it and just move
[11:34] on praise God that was Abraham without a
[11:37] Bible at that time that was Abraham
[11:39] without any any message books at that
[11:42] time that was Abraham without anything
[11:44] other than what he had heard God say
[11:47] amen and we have message books we have
[11:50] the word we have everything amen at our
[11:52] fingertips and sometimes we can't we
[11:54] have a hard time trusting God
[11:56] amen every single part of the word amen
[12:00] there's encouragement there's promises
[12:01] laying here for you that are good they
[12:04] were not just good for them but they're
[12:05] good for you now praise the Lord that
[12:08] you can walk upon amen and you can say
[12:10] Lord that's for me I take it and I claim
[12:13] it and just move on upon it amen that's
[12:15] how God wants you to do in this hour
[12:18] amen he don't want you to pitter-patter
[12:20] or or say but Lord but but but my
[12:23] situation no hey there's no situation
[12:26] amen too hard for God let me ask you
[12:29] this is there anything too hard for God
[12:32] the Bible says that amen so there's
[12:36] nothing all we can do is just take God
[12:38] at his word praise the Lord that's the
[12:41] best thing that's that's the best thing
[12:42] that you can do for God I heard someone
[12:44] recently I think it was brother Bob back
[12:46] in Nicaragua he said that's the best
[12:48] thing that you can do to please the Lord
[12:50] amen and it's just take God at his word
[12:53] amen
[12:54] praise the Lord so here's hundreds of
[12:57] years later and Moses comes on the scene
[12:59] amen because God was going to fulfill
[13:01] his word and here comes Moses on the
[13:04] scene and and and we all know the story
[13:06] they went through Egypt slaves for for
[13:09] over 400 years and then Here Comes Moses
[13:12] delivers the people and now Moses is
[13:14] tasked amen with taking the people to
[13:17] this Promised Land
[13:18] amen and and so if if it comes to a
[13:22] point where Moses wasn't able to take
[13:24] him in Praise the Lord because we see
[13:26] here in Joshua chapter 1 it says now
[13:27] after the death of Moses the servant of
[13:31] the Lord it came to pass praise the Lord
[13:33] Jesus amen and so it types it this types
[13:37] to me it types A lot a lot of what we
[13:41] have gone through and this is our day
[13:43] amen who was our Moses of our time amen
[13:46] the prophet brother Branham was our
[13:48] Moses praise God he typed different
[13:50] characters in The Bible one of those was
[13:52] Moses amen and so it says here now after
[13:56] the death of Moses the servant of the
[13:58] Lord it came to pass praise the Lord
[14:01] and we see here that Moses was dead
[14:04] amen just as our Prophet amen he's gone
[14:07] off the scene
[14:08] a lot of people are trying to resurrect
[14:10] them back again put them back in the
[14:12] Pulpit by playing the tapes at the
[14:15] church and all that which that's fine I
[14:18] mean we do it here but I'm just saying
[14:19] they actually literally believe that
[14:21] brother Branham is there speaking to
[14:23] them
[14:24] and to me that looks that seems to me
[14:26] like spiritualism I don't I don't know I
[14:28] don't know what else to call that
[14:29] spiritualism and that's our day
[14:32] amen because they're trying to put a man
[14:35] to live when he's gone off the scene
[14:38] brother Branham it wasn't brother
[14:40] Brandon's word it was God's word through
[14:41] brother Branham praise the Lord so
[14:43] that's where we're feeding off in this
[14:45] hour and so after the death of Moses the
[14:48] servant of the Lord
[14:49] I mean God said that he was dead
[14:54] amen
[14:56] he was dead brother Branham he's gone
[14:59] passed away he fulfilled what he was
[15:02] supposed to do amen it does does does it
[15:06] does not do us any good amen to to to to
[15:09] to uh venerate amen the the the things
[15:12] of of his you know uh His Ho his his
[15:16] belt or his boots or anything like that
[15:19] that does you no good
[15:21] amen
[15:23] if you don't obey the word that he
[15:25] preached
[15:27] that's what he would want you to do amen
[15:30] praise God so after the death of Moses
[15:33] the servant of the Lord it came to pass
[15:34] that the Lord spake unto Joshua amen and
[15:38] so Joshua in this our day we know he
[15:40] types the Holy Spirit even the name
[15:42] Joshua comes from the Hebrew word Yeshua
[15:45] amen which means Jesus our savior amen
[15:49] so it's very interesting that God
[15:51] actually makes Joshua amen a type of
[15:55] what Jesus was to us amen and who is
[15:58] Jesus the Holy Spirit and who is the
[16:00] Holy Spirit he's God Amen praise the
[16:02] Lord Jesus so it's it it's the same
[16:05] person and that's the person that's
[16:08] leading the church in this hour amen
[16:10] praise God it's the Holy Spirit working
[16:13] through the church amen working
[16:15] individually amen but working through a
[16:17] people Amen in order to do great things
[16:20] in this hour in order to fulfill his
[16:22] word how else is he going to fulfill his
[16:24] word amen if it isn't through a people
[16:27] praise God
[16:29] I'm just happy I'm just glad that that
[16:31] God God can use me God can use you Amen
[16:35] to fulfill his word now you say you
[16:38] might say well I don't know what kind of
[16:40] word he wants to fulfill through me I
[16:42] can't do any sort of big Miracles I
[16:44] can't I don't know what to do amen but
[16:46] but what about the word where it says it
[16:49] says husbands amen love your wives
[16:52] foreign
[16:54] of God
[16:56] how about the word that says and and
[16:58] wives respect your husbands
[17:01] isn't that the word of God
[17:04] well that's what God wants you to
[17:05] fulfill
[17:06] but that's the hard part
[17:09] that's the hard part when it comes oh my
[17:13] we we just it's it's wonderful laying
[17:16] hands on people and and and and and and
[17:18] praying for them and just thinking about
[17:21] great miracle things but when it talks
[17:23] about husbands love your wives and and
[17:25] and and and wives make sure to respect
[17:28] your husbands right I don't even know
[17:31] why I'm on this
[17:32] but it's Valentine's week so let's let's
[17:34] let's break that down a little bit you
[17:36] know
[17:39] you know the Bible does say husbands
[17:41] love your wives
[17:42] and and wives make sure to respect your
[17:45] husbands why
[17:46] why does it say that why doesn't it say
[17:48] wives make sure to love your husbands
[17:53] right
[17:55] because
[17:59] I know my wife loves me
[18:03] but I need to reassure her that I love
[18:05] her
[18:07] see wives need that reassurance but
[18:10] husbands don't really need that but
[18:12] that's why Paul carefully used the word
[18:14] respect
[18:15] see what we Thrive off of is respect
[18:19] right respect is what we need
[18:22] amen because when you respect that
[18:25] you're gonna get that love
[18:27] that just automatically comes with the
[18:29] with the territory and man you respect
[18:32] your your your your husband amen he'll
[18:35] do anything for you
[18:38] he knows you love him you don't need to
[18:41] show that or affection then that's and
[18:44] that's good and husbands when your wife
[18:46] is trying to show you that affection you
[18:48] need to be you need to accept that and
[18:50] receive that because remember in doing
[18:52] that you're showing her love right so
[18:55] it's Gotta it's got to work
[18:57] yeah it's got to work each each and
[18:59] every you know uh
[19:02] that way
[19:05] yeah and and and and then you know the
[19:08] the relationship it can just move good
[19:10] amen but there's problems that arise
[19:13] when when couples amen and and and
[19:15] married couples they they lose respect
[19:18] for one another
[19:20] and then they and then what turns out is
[19:22] that love starts declining in their
[19:25] lives as well
[19:26] and it's because they're not doing what
[19:27] Paul said to do so there is a word right
[19:30] there that you could you can go ahead
[19:32] and apply tonight when you get home and
[19:35] you can say Lord You're fulfilling your
[19:38] word through my life
[19:40] Hallelujah isn't that wonderful
[19:43] praise the Lord you know me I just like
[19:45] to bring things down home
[19:47] amen that you can take something home
[19:49] tonight and apply it tonight amen that's
[19:53] just what I like
[19:54] but you see God wanted to use Moses uh
[19:57] uh Joshua amen because Moses was off the
[20:00] scene amen and now it was time for
[20:02] someone to take the people into the
[20:04] promised land Joshua was with Moses amen
[20:07] doing learning and and and serving Moses
[20:11] all of this all of this time and he's
[20:13] gotten to a point now where God Amen has
[20:17] confidence in him amen where God can can
[20:21] put Joshua in a position where he he
[20:25] knows that he will obey what God tells
[20:27] him to do amen and so Joshua is here at
[20:31] this point and he's he it's scary just
[20:34] put yourself in his shoes
[20:37] it was a scary thing for Joshua amen
[20:41] with over 2 million people maybe I don't
[20:43] know exactly how many people were with
[20:45] him but it was a lot of people
[20:47] that he had to lead and he had to fill
[20:51] Moses's shoes in order to take the land
[20:54] that God had already given them but
[20:56] that's the key right there Saints that's
[20:59] the key and he he had to grab they had
[21:02] to take hold of the word that God had
[21:04] already given them throughout the years
[21:07] which was the land is yours I've given
[21:10] you this land it's yours just go and
[21:13] possess it amen and here comes the
[21:15] moment when they're getting ready to do
[21:17] that
[21:19] in verse 2 it says and Moses my servant
[21:22] is dead so he says it again now
[21:24] therefore arise
[21:26] amen go over this Jordan
[21:29] thou and all this people unto the land
[21:31] which I do give to them even to the
[21:34] children of Israel you know many times
[21:36] in in in in hymns before uh you can
[21:40] we're seeing some sometimes hymns and
[21:42] and they they type Jordan with with
[21:44] death and and and and and and dine but
[21:47] but when you look at what happened here
[21:50] it wasn't really a it wasn't really a
[21:52] death amen it was actually it's when
[21:54] they needed to start living out their
[21:56] life after after they crossed it was
[21:59] actually when when they crossed over it
[22:01] was hardships that that took place they
[22:03] had to start fighting for real then
[22:07] amen it wasn't Rosy and that's the same
[22:10] thing with you and I Saints amen it's
[22:12] when you become a Christian
[22:14] that you have to start fighting then
[22:16] before it was easy before it was it
[22:19] wasn't hard to say no to the cigarette
[22:21] and say no to the to the to to the to
[22:24] the blunt or to the weed or to the or to
[22:27] the cocaine bag or or whatever amen it
[22:30] was easy for you to take that in and and
[22:32] and say yeah but now amen something has
[22:36] worked started working in your life
[22:39] now there's a struggle yeah I always say
[22:42] if you're not struggling if you're not
[22:44] fighting something spiritually is not
[22:46] right there
[22:47] either God hasn't started something in
[22:49] your life or you just haven't come to it
[22:52] amen
[22:55] when you become a Christian amen when
[22:57] this when the Holy Spirit is worked in
[22:59] your life and is working in your life
[23:01] amen it becomes a it becomes a struggle
[23:03] becomes it becomes a fight then
[23:06] and who is going to win
[23:08] the one that you feed the most
[23:11] the black dog and white dog
[23:13] and then it's the one that that you feed
[23:15] the most is the one that wins
[23:18] Moses my servant is dead now therefore
[23:20] arise God tells Joshua go over this
[23:23] Jordan thou and all this people unto the
[23:26] land which I do give to them even to the
[23:28] children of Israel watch verse 3 every
[23:31] place that the soul of your foot shall
[23:34] tread upon that have I given you amen
[23:39] every promise that God has made in his
[23:42] word that have I given you in other
[23:44] words
[23:45] amen every family member that I have
[23:48] given you amen that have I given you
[23:51] amen everything that God has promised
[23:54] you amen is yours just to rise and take
[23:57] it and believe it and just move on with
[23:59] it and you'll see it take place
[24:01] Hallelujah
[24:04] every place at the sole of your foot
[24:06] shall tread upon amen and you see it
[24:10] treading upon amen it wasn't just just
[24:13] staying in one place
[24:17] I'm gonna stay right here and that's it
[24:19] God promise God promised me yeah God
[24:21] promised you that part amen but God
[24:23] promised you more than that too why
[24:25] don't you go and take it
[24:27] but sometimes words stay still and we do
[24:30] and we've failed to realize the the the
[24:33] the the what's really out there for us
[24:37] amen
[24:39] we hunker down on one word
[24:41] we hunker down on one Doctrine or we
[24:43] hunkered down on one on one thing and
[24:45] that and that's it I'm not moving from
[24:48] this amen but it's but it's every word
[24:51] of God Amen is profitable
[24:53] and it's good for you
[24:56] and it's a promise for you amen if you
[24:59] can just take it accept it walk upon it
[25:03] amen it takes Faith Amen to move your
[25:05] foot and just move on
[25:06] to something that you don't even you
[25:08] don't know what's beyond the the those
[25:10] borders
[25:12] but that is what God is telling Joshua
[25:15] to do
[25:16] amen
[25:21] he's telling him
[25:23] to rise
[25:26] and every place that the soul your foot
[25:28] shall tread upon that have I given unto
[25:30] you and watch as I said unto Moses
[25:35] wasn't Moses someone that you looked up
[25:37] to in other words Joshua
[25:40] right he obeyed my word or he he he he
[25:43] he he stayed with my promise he was
[25:46] looking to that promise yeah he had
[25:47] hardships he had struggles he had times
[25:50] where unbelief try to creep in if God is
[25:53] Lord why is this happening why is it
[25:56] didn't you promise amen but I kept my
[25:58] word all my promises amen you guys
[26:00] crossed the Red Sea
[26:03] I killed Egyptians for you in the middle
[26:05] of the sea
[26:07] amen I caused flies to come I cussed all
[26:10] kinds of pestilence to the Egyptians I
[26:13] did it
[26:15] so you have nothing to to worry about
[26:18] just listen to that word don't you think
[26:21] that brother Branham didn't struggle
[26:23] Amen to give us this word that we look
[26:25] that we that we enjoy this day

[26:34] I take I I take I take from that amen
[26:37] and I learn and I say uh I know I'm not
[26:40] going to do that
[26:42] because look what happened
[26:43] and that's the exact same thing that in
[26:46] First Corinthians I believe First
[26:47] Corinthians 10 Paul says that the things
[26:49] in the Old Testament the things happen
[26:51] they man for our for for us to learn
[26:54] from

[27:19] yeah
[27:20] yeah look what happened to my older uh
[27:23] brother or my older sister I ain't doing
[27:25] that
[27:26] hey man it gets edged in there
[27:30] all right
[27:33] because you saw what happened amen you
[27:36] saw the result you saw the consequences
[27:38] of that Disobedience or you saw the
[27:40] consequences of what of of that that
[27:43] took place amen well these things in the
[27:46] Old Testament were given for your
[27:48] benefit
[27:49] so that you could say Lord you know what
[27:52] I ain't doing that
[27:54] praise God
[27:56] I know better look what happened amen
[28:02] and so God is so mindful of us
[28:05] amen that he gives us amen he lets other
[28:07] people make mistakes
[28:10] for your benefit
[28:13] isn't that isn't that amazing
[28:16] other people made mistakes so that you
[28:18] don't make them today
[28:21] wow thank thank God
[28:23] amen
[28:24] but sometimes you know some of us we we
[28:27] have to make the mistakes in order to
[28:28] learn we see it in the Bible wow okay
[28:31] then we go off and do it anyway
[28:35] that's that's a hard head right there
[28:37] that one the Lord is gonna have to uh
[28:39] kind of work on just a little bit more
[28:42] [Laughter]
[28:43] because why he loves you
[28:46] I'm so glad that he loved me
[28:48] Hallelujah amen mistake after mistake
[28:53] fall After Fall amen but God said you
[28:57] know what I'm not leaving you there
[28:58] you're one of my soldiers you're a
[29:00] fighter amen let me go ahead and help
[29:03] you get up amen
[29:06] and a true Soldier doesn't stay down
[29:10] a true Soldier a man gets back up picks
[29:13] up his weapon amen what is our weapon
[29:15] our sword the word of God and moves on
[29:19] keeps fighting doesn't necessarily mean
[29:22] that there's not going to be another
[29:23] obstacle in the way does it necessarily
[29:25] mean that there's not another battle
[29:27] that's gonna that's gonna come and come
[29:29] come about amen but the his thing is
[29:32] about moving on
[29:34] and that's what I encourage you this
[29:36] this evening sayings just move on you
[29:39] know the word of God just move on
[29:42] keep walking keep possessing amen and
[29:45] God will take the rest I guarantee you
[29:48] amen
[29:50] you know as as Sunday we were we were
[29:53] talking uh brother Bob was mentioning
[29:56] with regards when we were in heading to
[29:59] Nicaragua and we got to a point there on
[30:02] that Wednesday when we left we were at
[30:05] the Atlanta airport and then the FFA
[30:08] thing came came out where they grounded
[30:11] all the planes
[30:13] and in our mind we're thinking okay well
[30:15] we'll just we'll just uh uh our plane
[30:19] from Atlanta to Houston is delayed
[30:21] that's fine
[30:23] but when we got to Houston that's when
[30:25] we all kind of started wondering like
[30:27] Lord is this really your will
[30:31] and then we got these we I get we got
[30:33] all these doubts we got all these all
[30:35] these all this uh all these things
[30:37] bombarding our mind as we're sitting
[30:39] standing three four hours in a line to
[30:42] talk to the customer service United
[30:43] customer service counter to see if they
[30:46] have when is our next flight that we can
[30:48] fly from Houston to to Nicaragua
[30:52] and we're there talking with each other
[30:53] and we're saying well if this don't
[30:56] happen then whatever then what we'll
[30:57] just tell them hey let's just take us
[30:59] back just send us back to Atlanta you
[31:01] know it's whatever
[31:03] but I I I got them together and I and I
[31:06] said I I said listen I I you know God
[31:10] brought us this far
[31:12] amen and there's a reason why amen God
[31:15] grounded planes
[31:17] that day amen and so let's just move on
[31:22] Amen with what we are we know we are
[31:26] tasks to do amen
[31:28] and God will take care of the rest I I
[31:30] don't know what it was you know we were
[31:32] hungry we were we were starving but we
[31:34] needed to get to that counter to see if
[31:36] they had some some flights a flight for
[31:38] all of us to get to
[31:40] and and
[31:42] uh when we got there
[31:46] we asked him we said listen it's eight
[31:48] of us that are flying and we really want
[31:50] to be together
[31:52] do you have a flight soon that we can
[31:55] fly to Nicaragua from Houston
[31:58] and miraculously they had a flight on
[32:00] Friday with eight seats available
[32:04] eight seats exactly what we needed
[32:09] so at that point we knew okay Lord you
[32:12] do want us to go
[32:16] but it's it's disheartening
[32:18] it's discouraging
[32:20] you see because we got we missed two
[32:22] days where we could have been uh the
[32:24] brother brother Bob was was supposed to
[32:26] minister on that Wednesday uh evening
[32:29] when we got there and and Thursday as
[32:31] well it was two days where we didn't get
[32:33] to minister
[32:34] but why did God allow that God knows
[32:38] and you know what the only thing I can
[32:40] think of is is maybe somebody who helped
[32:44] us at the hotel this those two evenings
[32:47] or even the place where we ate that fine
[32:49] barbecue there in Houston uh there was a
[32:52] young man that he Bob showed us a
[32:54] picture that that was so nice to us made
[32:58] us laugh it just made us feel so
[32:59] comfortable didn't he Michael so so so
[33:01] so good he was good to the bride
[33:04] and maybe because of that he might get
[33:06] an eternal life I don't know
[33:08] he was really good to us sit there talk
[33:11] to us and and and and and and and and
[33:12] just had just had some camaraderie with
[33:15] my wife about Filipinos and and and
[33:17] things like that and just and you know
[33:20] what we'll never forget that
[33:22] and we'll never forget him and maybe God
[33:25] grounded a plane just for him
[33:28] amen
[33:30] maybe God grounded remember when God
[33:31] grounded an airplane with brother
[33:33] Brandon to get on Just for that the
[33:35] shunamite woman that's that lady in
[33:37] Tennessee
[33:38] maybe God grounded us amen so that we
[33:41] can go eat barbecue at that place and
[33:44] that that that that guy amen
[33:47] get eternal life some sometime
[33:50] later on in life you know at the white
[33:53] Throne judgment I don't know but that's
[33:55] in God's hands but Joshua amen is is is
[33:59] is is in a position right now where he
[34:02] all he can do is say Lord you promised
[34:05] Moses and I just moved forward
[34:08] and that's what God wants him to do
[34:11] amen from the Wilderness and this
[34:14] Lebanon verse 4.
[34:16] even unto the Great River the river
[34:18] Euphrates all the land of the Hittites
[34:20] and unto the great seed toward the going
[34:22] down of the sun shall be your Coast
[34:25] there shall not any man be able to stand
[34:28] before thee all the days of thy life as
[34:30] I was with Moses
[34:32] so I will be with thee
[34:34] let me just bring it down to our day as
[34:36] I was with brother Branham so will I be
[34:39] with thee
[34:40] amen as I was with you put a name there
[34:45] so will I we be with thee you mean even
[34:48] in this day that we're living in this
[34:50] crooked age that we're living in this
[34:52] this dark hour that we're living in yes
[34:55] this day
[34:57] praise God because God promised it and
[35:00] he his word never fails amen
[35:03] they're shown
[35:06] as I was with Moses so I will be with
[35:07] thee I will not fail thee nor forsake
[35:10] thee
[35:11] and so watch in verse 6 be strong and of
[35:15] good courage
[35:16] I looked up the word strong and and it's
[35:19] defined this way this is what the word
[35:21] strong is able to withstand great force
[35:25] or pressure
[35:27] let me say that again able to withstand
[35:30] great force or pressure
[35:33] now this is the first time here in this
[35:35] in this in this chapter that God tells
[35:38] tells Joshua that
[35:40] tells them to be strong
[35:42] I mean Joshua don't you think that
[35:43] Joshua didn't display strength already
[35:46] I mean he told the sun to stand still
[35:48] told the moon to stand still he he
[35:50] fought great battles won them he did all
[35:53] kinds of great things and he God knew
[35:56] that he Joshua was going to be was going
[35:58] to come to a point of fear
[36:00] amen you might have had great things
[36:03] happen in your life you might have seen
[36:04] wonderful great Miracles take place amen
[36:07] but it might come down to something in
[36:08] your life amen
[36:10] where
[36:12] you don't know how to get past that
[36:15] amen maybe sickness is declining uh your
[36:18] health is declining maybe uh your your
[36:21] children or or whatever it may be you
[36:24] come to a point now where God Amen knows
[36:26] that you were going to get there
[36:28] you were going to be at that point but I
[36:30] tell you this day amen just as God told
[36:33] Joshua be strong and very courageous
[36:36] amen
[36:38] in other words you are able to withstand
[36:41] great force or pressure amen what what
[36:44] kind of age that this is amen uh
[36:48] compared to other ages amen the pressure
[36:52] and the force that's upon the people of
[36:54] God
[36:56] and it's getting worse and worse and
[36:58] worse
[36:59] mentally psychologically amen uh it's
[37:03] just it's it's wickedness in every
[37:05] corner
[37:07] amen is one thing you know seeing things
[37:09] in every corner but now it's just mind
[37:12] battles constantly
[37:14] constantly mind battles going through
[37:16] your mind going through amen and but God
[37:19] even in this day tells you be strong and
[37:22] very courageous
[37:25] is this word not good for this day
[37:29] this the same thing
[37:31] and so and so the word courage this is
[37:34] it means the ability to do something
[37:36] that frightens one
[37:40] amen or strength in the face of pain or
[37:45] grief
[37:46] mm-hmm that's the word courage
[37:49] amen
[37:52] sometimes we don't know where how to
[37:54] make take the next step amen when when
[37:56] when when when the pressing moments and
[37:59] and and things come and hit you Amen in
[38:03] your life in an unexpected way that you
[38:05] didn't even think it was going to be
[38:06] that way
[38:08] amen but God tells you to be strong and
[38:10] take and be of good courage
[38:13] amen
[38:14] doesn't matter what it is
[38:17] I know there's battles ahead in my life
[38:20] that I'm gonna have to face but I'm
[38:22] gonna have to be strong and take courage
[38:24] because this word that God's given us
[38:26] this word that God's given you this word
[38:29] that that you have come to amen you
[38:31] can't just leave it to the side
[38:34] and say and say I I give up amen what is
[38:37] that gonna do that's not gonna bring
[38:39] that's not going to bring your family
[38:40] member back that's not going to bring
[38:42] amen anything positive amen the only
[38:44] thing you can do amen is be strong and
[38:47] take good courage and move forward
[38:49] amen that that right there amen might
[38:52] just be the changed amen that somebody
[38:54] else needs to see
[38:56] in your darkest moment in your darkest
[38:58] hour amen you took strength and you took
[39:01] courage in the word amen and somebody
[39:04] saw that yes
[39:07] and it helped him
[39:10] praise God
[39:14] so Joshua is told be strong and and and
[39:16] of good courage For unto this people
[39:19] shall thou divide you will divide for an
[39:22] inheritance the land which I swear unto
[39:24] their fathers to give them and then he
[39:27] tells them again when God says something
[39:29] once twice more than twice
[39:32] that means pay attention
[39:35] because God knew that he was going to be
[39:37] under great pressure only be thou strong
[39:40] and very courageous and now he tells
[39:43] them very courageous
[39:46] that thou mayest observe to do according
[39:49] to all that the message
[39:52] says
[39:54] the law
[39:57] praise God
[40:00] you see now the law a man it could only
[40:02] come to a certain point
[40:04] the law couldn't really take them take
[40:06] them in
[40:07] amen
[40:09] the law can can uh can put you in prison
[40:12] as brother Branham said
[40:14] amen but it's the holy spirit amen that
[40:17] can give you Freedom amen now the law is
[40:20] is good they are up to a certain point
[40:22] but it condemns you
[40:24] it calls you and says hey you did wrong
[40:26] you deserve this punishment
[40:28] amen but the holy spirit is the one that
[40:31] gives Grace
[40:32] praise the Lord and I'm so thankful for
[40:34] grace in this hour
[40:35] amen so Moses could only take him up to
[40:38] a certain point because he was a
[40:39] representative of the law amen now
[40:42] Joshua the holy spirit is the one to
[40:44] take them over and desire only be thou
[40:46] strong very courageous that thou mayest
[40:48] observe to do according to all the law
[40:50] which Moses my servant commanded thee
[40:54] turn not from it to the right or to the
[40:57] left
[40:59] in other words don't get carried away by
[41:01] all wins a Doctrine
[41:03] amen
[41:04] amen amen stay balanced stay focused
[41:09] praise God
[41:10] because that is how people get get get
[41:12] sidetracked this day
[41:16] they go off on the shiny shiny what is a
[41:19] shiny syndrome
[41:20] shiny thing syndrome
[41:22] oh my this seems good look at this look
[41:25] what this brother's preaching goodness
[41:26] gracious oh my look at the way he
[41:29] preaches look at the way and then
[41:31] forgetting amen what God what why they
[41:34] even started serving the lord in the
[41:36] first place
[41:38] and then they find themselves amen
[41:40] following a man
[41:42] or a movement instead of the word
[41:47] yeah
[41:48] oh it's happened so many times
[41:50] throughout all these years
[41:52] amen
[41:54] you see it in the nominal world and you
[41:56] see it in the in the message too but God
[41:59] is telling the people in this hour amen
[42:01] amen stay balanced stay focused amen
[42:05] stay strong amen don't move over to the
[42:08] right don't move over to the left amen
[42:09] stay focused because that's the only way
[42:12] that the word amen will have an effect
[42:13] in your life and in other people's life
[42:16] don't get unbalanced don't get unfocused
[42:20] don't go with Fantastics as brother
[42:22] Brandon would say fantastic say man wow

[42:37] from the dead it's such and such a
[42:38] church amen if the word isn't preached

[46:09] I believe it can
[46:12] right amen
[46:14] but what other things are you putting
[46:15] ahead of him
[46:19] you know what those things are what is
[46:21] hindering your life from moving forward
[46:23] amen
[46:25] you can name it from A to Z
[46:29] amen
[46:30] so let let you you just take a look at
[46:34] that in your life praise the Lord
[46:38] amen
[46:39] just give me just a few more minutes
[46:42] this book of the law shall not depart
[46:44] out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate
[46:47] therein day and night
[46:50] amen
[46:51] that thou mayest observe to do according
[46:55] to
[46:56] all that is written therein
[47:00] for then Thou shalt make thy way
[47:02] prosperous look he says prosperous again
[47:05] you want prosperity
[47:07] amen that's right written right here and
[47:10] then Thou shalt have good success
[47:14] good success in this case it was Joshua
[47:17] amen going to go take the land going to
[47:20] go for fulfill the promises that God had
[47:23] already made to the Father Abraham
[47:25] amen but what is what is it in your case
[47:30] hey man
[47:32] I want to have a successful marriage I
[47:35] want to have a successful uh uh uh score
[47:38] in my exam my final exam I want to have
[47:42] a successful career I want to have a
[47:44] successful if you're an entrepreneur I
[47:46] want to be I want to be a successful
[47:48] entrepreneur I want to be a successful
[47:51] Minister I want to be a successful
[47:52] deacon
[47:53] amen I want to be a successful mother
[47:57] you put your yourself right there that
[48:00] is the that is the the path to follow
[48:01] right there that is the formula
[48:05] do not stray away from this word
[48:08] amen this is simple as that
[48:11] amen Don't Stray away from the word
[48:15] but I'll be the first one to tell you
[48:18] amen that I I get in trouble when I
[48:20] Stray away from the word and put
[48:22] otherworldly things ahead of the word of
[48:24] God
[48:26] you don't feel right
[48:28] you feel backslidden you feel you feel
[48:31] uh ashamed that you you feel and that's
[48:34] the reason why sometimes we don't even
[48:37] want to come to church
[48:38] because you put something else ahead of
[48:41] God
[48:42] and so you feel condemned and you feel
[48:45] backslidden and you don't feel like you
[48:47] can be in front of the people at the
[48:49] church
[48:50] amen but when you put the word of God
[48:53] before you amen
[48:56] you will have good success
[49:00] when the word of God is before you
[49:03] when the word of God is more important
[49:04] than anything else in your life you know
[49:06] a few months ago I talked about that how
[49:08] how important is the word of God to you
[49:11] do you even read the word
[49:13] do you even talk about the word amen do
[49:16] you even share the word amen is it that
[49:19] important to you
[49:21] or is it only just when we come to
[49:22] church
[49:23] that it's important
[49:26] yeah
[49:27] praise God now
[49:30] in in finishing off and you can read the
[49:32] rest of the chapter look at Verse 18 it
[49:34] says whosoever he be that doth rebel
[49:38] against thy commandment this is the
[49:40] people talking to Joshua
[49:42] and will not hearken unto thy words in
[49:46] all that thou command is him he shall be
[49:48] put to death only be strong and of good
[49:51] courage
[49:53] so they're telling him the same thing
[49:55] that
[49:56] Joshua was sharing with them that God
[49:58] told him to tell them amen so they got
[50:01] the word
[50:02] praise God now just real quick if you
[50:05] turn to Joshua chapter 3.
[50:08] they've come to a point now where
[50:09] they're getting ready to cross
[50:15] and it says here in verse 1 and Joshua
[50:17] Rose early in the morning
[50:20] and removed and they removed from
[50:22] shiddom and came to Jordan he and all
[50:25] the children of Israel enlarged there
[50:27] before they passed over and it came to
[50:29] pass after three days that the officers
[50:32] went through the host
[50:35] and they commanded the people saying
[50:37] when ye see the Ark of the Covenant of
[50:40] the Lord your God
[50:42] and the priests the Levites bearing it
[50:46] then ye shall remove from your place and
[50:49] go after it in other words what they're
[50:52] commanding the people to do is that when
[50:54] you see the Ark of the Covenant amen
[50:59] right that right over there
[51:02] when you see that being lifted up
[51:05] amen because that represents the word of
[51:06] God it represents many things right the
[51:09] word of God was being carried there
[51:11] it says when you see that first
[51:14] and then you see the priests the Levites
[51:18] bearing it
[51:19] then it's time for you to move
[51:22] amen
[51:23] because and this to me represents amen
[51:27] the the the fivefold ministry in this
[51:29] hour amen the faithful Ministry holds
[51:32] the Ark of the Covenant amen holds the
[51:34] ark amen they don't hold their own Ark
[51:36] they don't hold their own thing their
[51:38] own ideas or their own thoughts amen
[51:40] they only hold amen this word praise God
[51:44] and so the people were had to stand
[51:47] still unless they saw that word move
[51:50] ahead before them if the word don't say
[51:52] it you don't move
[51:54] if the word amen is not held before you
[51:59] amen you stand still
[52:00] right man if you don't understand
[52:03] something you stay still don't go off
[52:05] wondering let's say when are they going
[52:07] to move that Ark you know you just moved
[52:12] amen
[52:14] it's like like kind of kind of like
[52:16] freeze tag
[52:19] amen or Simon says yeah Simon Says and
[52:23] then you don't move until Simon Says
[52:26] right
[52:27] and Simon Says then then you do this
[52:31] then you move right
[52:33] but brother so and so said do this but
[52:37] Simon didn't say so so I ain't moving
[52:40] right
[52:43] how many like playing Simon Says
[52:45] amen
[52:48] and it gets people every time
[52:51] amen move your arm
[52:54] how Simon didn't say
[52:55] [Laughter]
[52:57] you're out
[53:00] that was the people here
[53:03] they were not supposed to move until
[53:05] that Ark of the Covenant was before them
[53:07] amen and in this day amen the Ark of the
[53:10] company is being by a five-fold Ministry
[53:12] in this hour amen it isn't the
[53:15] perfecting the the FIFA Ministry can't
[53:18] perfect you
[53:21] the Bible says by the Perfection but I
[53:24] can't perfect you neither can brother
[53:26] away neither can brother Dale neither
[53:28] can brother Bob or brother Aaron I can't
[53:30] perfect you I can only lift up the ark
[53:33] so that you can do it and then you have
[53:35] to take a a hold and start walking
[53:38] amen that's what brings your perfection
[53:42] amen I can only preach the word to you
[53:44] it's up to you if you want to go and
[53:46] Obey it
[53:47] I can only lift up the word Amen brother
[53:50] Wade can only lift up the word brother
[53:52] Dale can only lift up the word amen
[53:55] always that's all we can do it's up to
[53:57] you to see if you want to go home and
[53:59] Obey it
[54:02] in order to have good success
[54:05] praise God
[54:08] and so we should be we should be patient
[54:10] and we should be we should be uh
[54:13] have uh I think I'm listening the word
[54:16] of what I'm looking patient in other
[54:18] words discipline them amen
[54:20] to not move unless the word of God says
[54:24] amen praise God
[54:27] yet there shall be a space between you
[54:28] and it about 2 000 cubits by measure
[54:30] come not near unto it that you may know
[54:32] the way by which you must go for you
[54:35] have not passed this way heretofore amen
[54:39] there's things that we haven't come to
[54:41] it this at this Junction in time
[54:43] amen we we some of these things
[54:46] especially after 2020 some of these
[54:48] things are new to us
[54:49] traveling new grounds amen
[54:53] and sometimes we want to make certain
[54:54] assumptions and we want to make certain
[54:56] uh uh uh ideas about certain things amen
[55:00] but what does the word of God say
[55:03] amen
[55:04] that's where I want to stay
[55:07] hey man that that is that is what I am
[55:10] uh tasked to do is to look at that at
[55:13] that word because it's that word that's
[55:15] going to lead me through amen
[55:18] and Joshua said unto the people sanctify
[55:20] yourselves for tomorrow the Lord will do
[55:23] wonders among you
[55:25] and Joshua spake unto the priest saying
[55:27] take up the Ark of the Covenant and pass
[55:29] over before the people remember the Ark
[55:31] of the Covenant representing the word
[55:33] and pass before the people and they took
[55:36] up the Ark of the Covenant and went
[55:38] before the people
[55:40] and the Lord said unto Joshua this day
[55:43] will I begin to magnify thee in the
[55:45] sight of all Israel that they may know
[55:48] that as I was with Moses so I will be
[55:51] with thee
[55:52] now I like that I like that there in the
[55:55] sense that even though it was the
[55:57] priests holding up the word it was still
[55:59] God working on the scene
[56:01] [Laughter]
[56:02] amen it wasn't the priest doing it the
[56:05] whole time or doing the miracle it was
[56:08] it was the whole thing was led by God
[56:12] but it was dependent upon them if they
[56:14] were going to obey amen that word or not
[56:19] you know what if the people said what if
[56:21] the priests took up the the ark and the
[56:24] people were like standing right there
[56:25] and then the the priest walked by them
[56:28] and they're like wait wait a second hold
[56:30] on a second you know getting ahead
[56:34] God wasn't then God was not going to be
[56:37] able to do what he was supposed to do
[56:39] what he wanted to do
[56:43] sometimes we think that we could get
[56:45] ahead of the ministry
[56:47] and we can we can uh
[56:50] we can put one over them in other words
[56:54] we're a little smarter than them
[56:58] you know
[56:59] but
[57:01] God called them for that position not
[57:04] you for that position amen
[57:06] and so all you can do is stay Amen in
[57:10] your position because I can't fulfill
[57:12] your position and you can't fulfill mine
[57:15] amen
[57:18] and the ministry man is one that
[57:20] ministered you see this is this was a
[57:22] task a heavy task for these ministers to
[57:24] do
[57:25] carrying carrying the it wasn't like
[57:27] that I'll tell you that it wasn't that
[57:30] size
[57:31] yeah this is good probably about this
[57:35] size or maybe more way
[57:37] weighed a lot and they had to walk you
[57:41] can just read the rest of the chapter
[57:42] where we're getting ready to finish
[57:44] walk through the through the through uh
[57:47] to the banks amen
[57:50] and they were get to the point
[57:53] I mean they they didn't know if if the
[57:55] river was gonna was gonna they were
[57:57] gonna walk on dry ground or not amen
[58:00] but they were just obeying what God Said
[58:02] walking with that heavy word
[58:05] amen
[58:07] and that's what a true minister is
[58:10] he labors for you
[58:13] amen he he's here to minister to you
[58:17] that's that's what a minister is he's
[58:19] here for you not to minister to him is
[58:22] for him to minister to you
[58:24] that's what a true minister is
[58:28] I'll always say that you know and I'll
[58:31] never forget that whenever you look at
[58:33] this picture when we're washing feet
[58:35] amen that was the greatest Minister that
[58:38] ever has been is the Lord Jesus Christ
[58:41] and he got down to watch some dirty feet
[58:44] amen
[58:46] greatest preacher ever
[58:48] and he humbled himself
[58:50] that's what a true Minister does
[58:53] he humbles himself
[58:54] hey man
[58:56] he's humble and and and he's Meek and he
[59:00] always holds the word of God before the
[59:02] people
[59:04] amen
[59:07] so it you read the rest of the chapter
[59:09] at a point they come and God Departed
[59:12] the waters and they crossed through Dry
[59:14] ground amen
[59:16] but they had to obey the word of God
[59:19] first
[59:20] you want to see miracles in your life be
[59:22] strong
[59:24] and very courageous
[59:27] stay in your place
[59:29] let God Amen obey what God Said in his
[59:31] word
[59:32] and God will take care of the rest
[59:35] you want to see your heart your your
[59:37] loved ones saved
[59:39] stay in your place
[59:41] stay in the word
[59:42] amen
[59:45] you want to prosper in your life
[59:48] stay in your place stay focused
[59:51] stay focused on what God has given you
[59:55] know sometimes we might think the grass
[59:56] is greener on the other side
[59:59] oh it's better it's prettier it's nicer
[1:00:01] at that church
[1:00:03] but you don't you don't know why the
[1:00:05] whole reason why you're here
[1:00:09] there's something that you've got to
[1:00:11] fulfill here
[1:00:13] otherwise you'd be there
[1:00:15] and if you can't do it here you're not
[1:00:17] going to be able to do it there
[1:00:20] you see
[1:00:21] oh but but brother such and such is such
[1:00:25] a church I mean he preaches very nice
[1:00:27] and he look at the way he he ministers I
[1:00:29] mean he's he's calm and you know he's
[1:00:31] amen but
[1:00:34] how are you dealing with it now
[1:00:37] maybe God is trying to teach you through
[1:00:40] the ministry here
[1:00:41] for something personally to you
[1:00:44] that you need to fix yourself
[1:00:47] amen so God is telling you hey there's a
[1:00:50] little something in your life that you
[1:00:51] need to minister to you need you need to
[1:00:54] work out in your life and I'm using that
[1:00:56] church over there to to grind at you
[1:00:59] that way so that you can get to where I
[1:01:01] need you to get
[1:01:02] husband
[1:01:05] because the way you are at this church
[1:01:09] it'll be the same way you will be over
[1:01:11] there
[1:01:12] hey it won't change it's a it's a
[1:01:15] personal problem that you carry
[1:01:17] everywhere you go that's why we have
[1:01:20] some people here there's Church hoppers
[1:01:23] and they're never satisfied because they
[1:01:25] think the problem is with the preacher
[1:01:27] or the church but the problem they're
[1:01:29] carrying it themselves
[1:01:30] they are the problem and they don't need
[1:01:33] that problem in their church I guarantee
[1:01:35] you that
[1:01:36] so God put you here amen so that you can
[1:01:40] be perfected
[1:01:42] through this ministry amen and I'm
[1:01:45] thankful amen I'm thankful that that you
[1:01:48] know sometimes you you you ask yourself
[1:01:50] Lord you led me this way and and and and
[1:01:53] and and and and you wonder about things
[1:01:55] in life
[1:01:57] and you may not know all the answers to
[1:01:59] everything
[1:02:00] neither did Joshua
[1:02:02] he didn't understand everything
[1:02:05] all he could take hold was the promise
[1:02:07] that God gave Moses
[1:02:09] and that's all you can do in this hour
[1:02:11] take a hold of the word that God's given
[1:02:14] our Moses that God has given Paul has
[1:02:18] given all the different all the
[1:02:20] different ones in the Bible they were
[1:02:23] there for your example for you to grow
[1:02:27] to come to the stature of a perfect man
[1:02:30] amen you believe that praise the Lord
