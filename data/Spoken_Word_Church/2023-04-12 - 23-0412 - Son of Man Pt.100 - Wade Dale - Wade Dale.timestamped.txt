[12:21] his heart they don't know why it don't
[12:23] have a hole in his heart doctors usually
[12:25] are not very wrong
[12:26] well they were probably wrong on that
[12:28] one or they were right and then they got
[12:29] wrong by
[12:31] a healing that that happened
[12:34] by the fervent prayer of the Bride of
[12:37] Jesus Christ and we appreciate the Lord

[13:34] pray for me if I had an urgent request
[13:35] so we need to return the favor Lord and

[14:27] yeah just remember remember brother Joe
[14:30] Greene and his wife they're over there
[14:33] in farmtown Jamaica having services
[14:35] so it's um good to hear from them in the
[14:38] beginning was the word the word was with
[14:40] God and the Word was God and that word
[14:42] was made flesh and walked among us and
[14:44] we beheld his glory the glory the only
[14:46] begotten of the father
[14:47] full of grace and truth II Peter 1 5
[14:51] says besides this
[14:53] well we said besides the new birth
[14:55] giving all diligence add to your faith
[14:57] virtue and The Virtue knowledge for
[14:59] knowledge Temperance Temperance patience
[15:01] patience godliness
[15:03] First Timothy 3 16 says without
[15:06] controversy
[15:07] all right there's no disputation there's
[15:09] no no way to get out of this if you're
[15:12] if you're a child of God if you're a son
[15:14] and daughter of God without Contra for
[15:17] controversy great is this mystery of
[15:19] godliness because it's going to be in
[15:21] you
[15:22] but when I have to uh I can't find it in
[15:25] Jesus Christ because I don't see him
[15:27] you understand I don't see him here with
[15:29] his physical him walking around I see it
[15:31] in US
[15:33] so that's godliness that's God God
[15:35] listen it's easy for God to be Godly
[15:37] because it's God
[15:38] but us being Sinners made made in His
[15:43] image and made in his likeness and made
[15:46] with and get the new birth then there's
[15:48] the mystery of godliness is that we can
[15:50] live and see and work just like God
[15:53] and I'll prove it to you in just a
[15:55] little bit brother Brown you know it's
[15:56] always that question I can't be good
[15:58] enough God doesn't ask you to be good
[16:00] enough he just asked you to do what he
[16:02] said just get in Christ and let him do
[16:04] the work all right remember we'll read
[16:06] the quote where scrap heaps of ministers
[16:08] that have tried people have tried to
[16:10] what Pentecost has tried to produce
[16:13] something they try to work something up
[16:14] they try to get
[16:16] it's going to come down to this right
[16:18] here without controversy great is the
[16:21] mystery of godliness God was manifested
[16:24] in the flesh justified in the spirit
[16:26] scene of angels preaching to the
[16:28] Gentiles believed on in the world
[16:30] and received up in the glory you may be
[16:32] seated
[16:33] that word with controversy is Strife or
[16:36] without dispute without a quarrel we're
[16:40] not going to sit and we're not we're not
[16:41] going to argue I'm not going to argue
[16:43] with somebody that I can't be like God
[16:45] because God told me I had to be like God
[16:47] all right and if he did then guess what
[16:50] he had to do he had to make a way that
[16:52] even just common folks like us can make
[16:54] it not some Theologian not somebody
[16:55] knows more than you know but something
[16:58] that we can do starting in our everyday
[16:59] life in this Plan of Redemption that
[17:02] we've been talking about and we see that
[17:04] Plan of Redemption I see it more and
[17:06] more
[17:08] I was watching a brother online this
[17:10] yesterday and and uh you just kind of
[17:13] see what's going on out in the in the
[17:16] message world and and he was talking
[17:17] about free more agency and he said this
[17:19] message did away with free moral agency
[17:22] I said I want to see that quote
[17:25] I want to see where that was done away
[17:27] with in this message
[17:29] you still are a free moral agent you can
[17:31] sit here today and you can take that
[17:34] right there or you can reject it you can
[17:36] take God and you can reject it you can
[17:38] decide
[17:39] for yourself if you're going to go on
[17:41] with God or you're not going to go on
[17:42] with God we're still human and in our
[17:45] Humanity we still have choices every day
[17:47] that we have to make so I don't
[17:49] understand where well I do understand
[17:51] because they want to talk about that
[17:52] Seed doctrine where you was just lying
[17:54] down through hearing you because there's
[17:55] no other way you could come well by
[17:58] foreknowledge you can say that but not
[18:01] just by predestination let's read this
[18:02] right here so foreknowledge looks back
[18:05] and says that he foresaw this and he
[18:08] knows that's a reason he could tell what
[18:11] the end was from the beginning
[18:12] to me that is so simple
[18:15] God is God he's infinite
[18:18] amen he can see he already saw your
[18:20] whole life before he even said let there
[18:23] be
[18:24] before he made an angel he knew your
[18:26] life he knew the day you were going to
[18:28] get born again or the day you were going
[18:30] to turn it down because he's God
[18:32] and be in God now that we can go back in
[18:35] the back part of God's mind we can as
[18:38] Chris was talking about this weekend you
[18:40] know you see you've got the quotes about
[18:41] the seed over here and you got the
[18:42] quotes about the seed but I like what he
[18:44] said he brought out a good point he said
[18:46] it's not something inside of you that's
[18:48] tangible
[18:49] and I like that
[18:51] you can't do away with a quote over here
[18:54] that you came here with this with this
[18:56] seed and I read it uh and back here just
[18:58] a few minutes ago and then over here
[18:59] where you were born lost
[19:01] all right you got to bring it in the
[19:03] middle and realize that there's not a
[19:06] tangible anything in you that's that
[19:08] wasn't even that like Adolf Hitler
[19:10] different ones I'm telling him to be
[19:13] just God had to bring everybody here the
[19:15] same way
[19:16] everybody on the same free moral agency
[19:19] even Kane he told Kane he said Kane if
[19:22] you'll do different what make a choice
[19:26] if you'll make a choice I'll bring you
[19:29] in the fold but he knew before the
[19:31] foundation of the world what Cain would
[19:33] do brother Brown said he knew that if he
[19:35] put Adam and even human flesh they'd
[19:37] fall
[19:39] but being a righteous judge he can't get
[19:42] in the way of that and make you not be
[19:44] that
[19:47] because at the end time when we come up
[19:49] to the day of judgment
[19:51] if we're not judged here we're going to
[19:53] be judged there
[19:54] and if we're judged there
[19:56] Adolf Hitler's got same chance me and
[19:58] you got or he did he doesn't now but he
[20:01] did before
[20:02] but by far in all this God could see
[20:04] Adolf Hitler's life and we'll use him
[20:06] and and I'm not ashamed to use him
[20:09] because he was vile he he was almost the
[20:12] Devil Himself had six million Jews
[20:14] killed and it was just not a it was not
[20:17] a mercy killing he killed him right and
[20:19] left all right so he was a vile man
[20:22] but he had the same chance you did or
[20:25] God's Not Just
[20:26] Adolf Hitler can stand it at the day of
[20:29] judgment and say Hey you made them
[20:31] different for me that makes you not
[20:32] righteous you can't judge me
[20:34] but see he didn't he made us all feel
[20:37] more agency he's going to say no Danny
[20:39] Fountain is standing right here because
[20:41] and he'll tell him the very day the very
[20:43] hour and the very moment that he
[20:45] received Christ as his personal savior
[20:47] all right so to me that makes it so
[20:49] simple that God put everybody on free
[20:52] moral agency and you got a choice to
[20:54] make
[20:56] you still got a choice to make now even
[20:58] after you're born again
[21:01] I was looking at that a little bit a few
[21:03] minutes ago but let's let's continue
[21:04] I'll get into it in just a second the
[21:06] reason he could tell what the end was
[21:07] from the beginning and therefore knowing
[21:09] knowing that all these marvelous days
[21:12] we're living in now that were living
[21:14] into standing witness and see the things
[21:17] that we've seen now see he's already
[21:19] seen it
[21:20] we are seeing it now
[21:22] all right God had to make a preparation
[21:25] for it he knew that that that that that
[21:29] I you whoever would come to a place to
[21:33] where we might go out in the world and
[21:35] we we would do the things of the world
[21:37] but we would come to a place where said
[21:38] hey that's enough
[21:40] you had to come to that same place God
[21:42] came knocking on your door for the last
[21:44] time but he knew you would react as you
[21:47] reacted he didn't get a surprise he knew
[21:50] how you would react so now therefore I
[21:52] do believe in predestination he
[21:54] predetermined it because he saw it first
[21:57] then he could predetermine every bit of
[21:59] this but by foreknowledge
[22:02] and your choice
[22:04] see I can go with anybody on a seed
[22:06] doctor and talk about choice
[22:09] and something not being tangible inside
[22:11] of you that kept me something
[22:13] eternal life can't be rambling around
[22:15] somewhere inside of you while you're a
[22:16] sinner I am so sorry that is not going
[22:19] to happen
[22:19] amen God will not dwell on an unclean
[22:21] vessel why does he clean you up why does
[22:24] the unclean Spirit have to go out of you
[22:26] well all that that why is the Plan of
[22:29] Redemption just well just believe it and
[22:31] there it is it'll just pop right up
[22:33] no
[22:35] no it's a birth and what is a birth a
[22:38] birth is a mess a birth is birthing what
[22:40] into the world and you're getting a
[22:43] nature and I was thinking about this
[22:45] yesterday you get a nature and that
[22:46] nature is not of God
[22:49] or you wouldn't need a new birth
[22:52] that Nature's of the devil
[22:56] and there's not a nature of God inside
[22:58] of you to combat that at that moment or
[23:01] it would
[23:02] it's like brother they always talk about
[23:04] a long time ago about two Soul doctors
[23:06] and that's kind of what it is they've
[23:07] just they've just cleaned the pig up and
[23:09] painted the pig
[23:12] it's the same thing you know you get two
[23:14] souls or two Natures or they're in there
[23:16] fighting they ain't in there fighting in
[23:17] your soul it's either Faith or doubt
[23:20] tonight it's either Faith or doubt
[23:22] brother Adam never change that he never
[23:24] said there was three or four people in
[23:25] your soul he said his faith are down
[23:28] one are the two not one and the two
[23:32] so what's fighting you now is your
[23:35] second realm your spirit realm is what
[23:38] I'm talking about now I'm talking if
[23:39] you're born again today we are not
[23:41] talking about that we're talking about
[23:44] then
[23:45] chief
[23:47] which one wins he said the one I feed
[23:50] now this it wasn't white dog black dog
[23:52] in his soul
[23:54] you can't have that if you got the new
[23:56] birth if you got the new birth I thought
[23:58] that cleaned all that out and what
[24:00] sealed you
[24:01] sealed you now listen if God sealed you
[24:04] and the devil in at the same time we got
[24:06] an issue
[24:08] but he didn't something had to be driven
[24:11] out of you according to the Book of Luke
[24:12] driven out and if you didn't get it all
[24:15] cleaned up and if you didn't get it
[24:17] patched up and vulcanized he's gonna
[24:21] come right back in
[24:24] but we fight that folks in our spirit
[24:26] realm today
[24:27] most of your fight is going to be in
[24:29] your spirit realm because remember your
[24:31] soul is perfect if you're born again
[24:32] perfect complete never sin never had a
[24:35] bad day never said a bad word never had
[24:37] a bad thought
[24:41] but yet he's living inside of you
[24:44] that's your theophany that's what's
[24:45] working that's what's firing you every
[24:48] day but there is a nature when you was
[24:50] born through your mom and your daddy you
[24:52] were given a nature that you've been
[24:55] that you're fighting all the time
[24:58] but you got to realize whether it's in
[25:00] your soul fighting it or whether it's in
[25:02] your spirit fighting it
[25:03] that's this whole thing that's why I
[25:05] spent all that time on the new birth on
[25:06] faith you got to believe that God is in
[25:09] your soul and the devil is not
[25:12] right you're sealed until the day of
[25:14] your Redemption but all these other
[25:16] things the outside that Spirit realm of
[25:18] memories and contradiction imagination
[25:19] there's where Satan is playing with you
[25:22] at
[25:22] there's where Satan is bombarding you
[25:24] every day of your life saying you're not
[25:26] worth it
[25:28] but that guy inside of you says yes you
[25:29] are because listen that guy inside is
[25:32] gonna if he's born again he's gonna lean
[25:34] to the word of God
[25:35] and I'm going to read you here in just a
[25:37] few minutes it has to because the seed
[25:40] remaineth in them in you or them you and
[25:43] you can't sin
[25:47] and remember
[25:49] when you read that scripture
[25:51] you got to remember that the Bible is
[25:53] written to Christians
[25:56] okay
[25:58] so the seed remains in you after you're
[26:00] born again not not remains in you at
[26:02] your birth
[26:03] that's your baby birth that's your new
[26:05] birth yes but not at your baby birth
[26:08] why would Paul have to fight why would
[26:10] Paul have Christians killed if he had
[26:12] anything inside of him that was
[26:14] eternal life
[26:15] that'd be that'd be God fighting God
[26:18] but it wasn't
[26:20] it wasn't sure there was representation
[26:22] as well Chris was talking about if you
[26:24] go about representation then you're
[26:26] there because what is what's represented
[26:28] is the mind of God has come to the Earth
[26:30] and this is what we're doing we're
[26:31] looking at Time and Eternity
[26:34] we're looking at time here and Eternity
[26:36] here and we've got to look at that
[26:39] Eternal part and that's what we've got
[26:41] as we were talking the other day a typos
[26:44] that's where you tie it to you tie it to
[26:46] that eternal life you tie it to that
[26:48] experience that you have that the things
[26:50] I used to do I do them no more now
[26:53] listen we slip up and make mistakes but
[26:55] remember if you're born again in your
[26:57] soul
[26:58] you don't make mistakes
[27:00] God does not make mistakes
[27:04] we've got to do what white dog has got
[27:07] to be fed more than the black dog
[27:10] and the black dog is that one right
[27:12] there we're talking going about Statue
[27:13] of perfect man we can let him win
[27:15] because we don't listen we don't come to
[27:18] church we don't pray we don't study
[27:22] let's listen to what brother Ryan says
[27:24] that I love this Chris was talking about
[27:25] it too back in the back part of God's
[27:28] mind there was something that he was
[27:29] trying and was going to achieve now why
[27:31] was he going to achieve this he knew
[27:33] we'd be lost
[27:35] he knew we would need this
[27:38] he knew we would need 60 years after the
[27:41] prophet left for us to get this thing
[27:43] right
[27:45] but there was something he was going to
[27:47] achieve
[27:49] and he had a motive in doing it why he
[27:52] wanted to get you back to that Genesis 1
[27:54] 26 man in its fullness
[27:58] everybody with me
[28:00] look but it's in order to let him be
[28:02] expressed not you
[28:05] in order to let him be expressed through
[28:07] you
[28:09] he had to do these things he had to let
[28:11] us
[28:13] get lost
[28:15] he had to let us because he was what he
[28:17] had a attribute of a savior a redeemer
[28:19] and the whole book of redemption
[28:22] you know if you look at Revelations 5
[28:25] and you look at that and you see that
[28:27] book and you see it being in in the
[28:30] hands of the original owner well that
[28:32] was a book of your name
[28:34] that was the book of eternal life that
[28:36] was not the book of all the other people
[28:38] because that's a special part of the
[28:40] book
[28:41] that's the Eternal section
[28:43] that's the part God had and said I have
[28:45] redeemed this or I have held this I'm
[28:47] sorry I've held this Adam couldn't do it
[28:49] because Adam was not a redeemer
[28:52] Adam died his soul went to the whatever
[28:55] demand to paradise and he couldn't save
[28:57] nobody else but thank God Jesus Christ
[28:59] could go through all those Dimensions it
[29:02] didn't matter where he could come back
[29:03] go inside of you praise God he could go
[29:06] inside of you and live his life through
[29:08] you
[29:09] then we set like a bump on a pickle
[29:13] we got to be happy about this at least
[29:15] smile
[29:20] first it wasn't even a moon a star and
[29:22] Adam a molecule anything he was gone
[29:25] but now watch brother around he backs up
[29:27] he said he wasn't exactly God
[29:30] because God's an object to worship and
[29:32] God's not a name
[29:35] God's a title
[29:37] he had to have a name
[29:40] his name was Jesus Christ so in his
[29:42] great mind he wanted these attributes to
[29:43] be expressed now where were we where was
[29:46] that book where was that where was that
[29:48] part of God that Genesis 1 26 man it
[29:52] could not be unfolded in the Old
[29:54] Testament it could not be unfolded until
[29:56] the New Testament in his blood where he
[29:59] could save us be a savior be a father
[30:02] son healer and all these great
[30:05] attributes they were in God but remember
[30:07] being in God they were expressed when he
[30:10] died and came back and then went into
[30:12] the 120 as they were speaking of this
[30:15] weekend
[30:16] you know Jesus could have just died not
[30:17] been it
[30:20] he has all of us inside of him though
[30:23] that was his whole being of nevertheless
[30:27] his brother
[30:28] um
[30:29] Dutch was speaking brother Chris you
[30:31] know nevertheless
[30:33] not my will
[30:35] you know who was taught talking
[30:36] all right we were the expression he
[30:40] wanted to get out it wasn't it wasn't he
[30:42] was gonna sure he died alone as a human
[30:44] being but he didn't die alone in his
[30:46] Spirit Realm
[30:47] he had all of us in it millions of bride
[30:50] he had you and I in there
[30:54] when he was on the cross what I was on
[30:56] his mind
[30:59] Hebrews 9 says fret the blood of bulls
[31:01] and goats and the ashes of a heifer
[31:03] sprinkling the unclean Sanctified to the
[31:05] purifying of the flesh now if we just
[31:07] stopped right there and stayed in the
[31:09] Old Testament absolutely you couldn't
[31:11] say I'm perfected by God absolutely you
[31:13] couldn't say I am God made manifest in
[31:16] flesh you couldn't say it I am a son and
[31:18] daughter of God
[31:20] if we stayed right there
[31:23] how much more though shall the blood of
[31:25] Christ who through the eternal spirit
[31:28] there's the key that eternal spirit is
[31:31] eternal life which is the new birth and
[31:33] that is not in you when you're born
[31:35] you're born dead
[31:36] that has to come inside of you by a
[31:40] birth to do what purge your conscience
[31:44] from dead words to serve a living God
[31:46] Paul's asking these questions
[31:48] and for this cause he's the mediator of
[31:51] the New Testament by means of death his
[31:54] death
[31:55] for the Redemption of the transgressions
[31:57] I thought we were perfect
[31:59] for the Redemption of the transgressions
[32:01] that were under the first testament they
[32:05] which are called might receive the
[32:06] promise of Eternal inheritance for where
[32:09] a testament is there must be necessity
[32:11] to be the death of a testator Jesus knew
[32:14] he was dying that's why he could say in
[32:16] the upper room this is a new testament
[32:18] in my blood
[32:19] for a testament is a force after men are
[32:22] dead otherwise it is of no strength at
[32:25] all while the test day to liveth
[32:28] II Peter 3 14 wherefore beloved seeing
[32:30] that you look for such things be
[32:32] diligent that you may be found of him in
[32:35] peace look at without spot and blameless
[32:41] there's no way in your natural self you
[32:43] can do that there's no way in your in
[32:44] your natural human nature you can do
[32:46] that
[32:48] an account that the long-suffering of
[32:50] Our Lord is salvation
[32:52] you see what he's saying the
[32:53] long-suffering
[32:55] of Our Lord is salvation
[32:58] even as our beloved brother Paul also
[33:00] according to the wisdom given unto him
[33:02] hath written
[33:03] unto you first Corinthians 1 7.
[33:07] so that you come behind in no gift
[33:09] waiting for the coming of Our Lord who
[33:11] shall also confirm you unto the end that
[33:14] you may be blameless in the day of our
[33:17] Lord Jesus now what is today today is
[33:19] the day of our Lord Jesus all right God
[33:22] is faithful by whom you were called into
[33:24] the fellowship of his son Jesus Christ
[33:26] Our Lord now I beseech she brethren
[33:29] by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[33:31] that you all speak the same thing
[33:33] there'll be no divisions among him we
[33:36] got a lot of work to do but that ye be
[33:39] perfectly joined together in the same
[33:42] mind and in the same judgment
[33:46] now here we go this is going to hit us
[33:48] right between the eyes
[33:50] know you not that the unrighteous shall
[33:52] not inherit the kingdom of God all right
[33:54] we're unrighteous we were not worthy we
[33:56] didn't deserve the kingdom of God but it
[33:58] was there for us as brother Chris said
[34:01] by representation God knew that a group
[34:04] of people would want it so he made it
[34:07] for us
[34:08] a place
[34:10] be not deceived neither fornicators
[34:12] idolaters adulterers effeminate abusers
[34:15] of himself and Mankind you look these up
[34:17] I'm not they're horrible nor thieves nor
[34:19] Covetous nor drunkards how many all have
[34:21] already
[34:22] okay now revilers extortioners shall
[34:25] inherit the kingdom of God we're done
[34:29] we're done
[34:31] and search for some of you
[34:33] Paul's preaching to his congregation the
[34:36] Corinthians he said as such were some of
[34:38] you well now what was he doing he wasn't
[34:40] judging them he was telling them but you
[34:43] are washed you have a way out you have a
[34:46] way of Escape
[34:48] amen you have a way to be judged now to
[34:50] be Sanctified now now listen that's the
[34:53] first church age that's to the
[34:55] Corinthians what about now
[34:58] what about now when we have the perfect
[35:00] word of God we've been we've been
[35:02] brought back to that Faith right we've
[35:05] been brought back to the faith that was
[35:07] once delivered to these people right
[35:08] here
[35:09] and search for some of you but you are
[35:11] washed but you are Sanctified but you
[35:13] are justified in the name of the Lord
[35:14] Jesus and by the spirit of our God
[35:19] Philippians 2 15 says you that you may
[35:21] be blameless
[35:23] and harmless
[35:25] the sons of God without rebuke
[35:28] in the midst of a crooked and perverse
[35:31] Nation well we're here
[35:34] we're here among whom you shine as
[35:37] lights
[35:39] in the world different yes sir gotta
[35:42] make you different if he's inside of you
[35:48] all right we'll know what temperature is
[35:49] let's continue through here with patient
[35:51] just a minute I want to get the
[35:51] godliness
[35:57] you know you got faith virtue knowledge
[35:59] Temperance and then you come to patience
[36:02] and patience says stand there
[36:05] stand right there
[36:07] Temperance is kind of an involvement you
[36:09] know you you got to watch your temper
[36:10] and you gotta there's a kind of a
[36:12] two-way thing but when you look at
[36:14] patience what brother Brown say the
[36:16] first person to have patience with God
[36:18] so you stand there brother Brown said
[36:21] when you've done all stand can we do
[36:23] that can we stand though knowing that we
[36:27] have faith virtue knowledge and
[36:29] Temperance working toward our patients
[36:33] that's why these are in perfect order
[36:37] but I will read you a quote here in a
[36:38] minute where brother Byron said look
[36:39] we've come all the way up this pyramid
[36:42] to Godliness and he said it's up here it
[36:45] wasn't down here because God knew you
[36:47] couldn't live it down here
[36:49] he put it way up here that's my
[36:52] brotherly kindness is way up there
[36:57] because it's real hard to love your
[36:58] neighbor as you love yourself
[37:01] so steadfast this constancy endurance
[37:06] how many of us like to have it I mean we
[37:08] don't sometimes we slip off into
[37:10] eternity eternity and we have a constant
[37:12] life
[37:14] every once in a while
[37:17] and you say man this is good and then
[37:19] all of a sudden when you say that guess
[37:20] what happens
[37:21] you know the devil hears you too
[37:24] but constancy that's what I like I like
[37:27] things being constant I like things I
[37:28] don't like a lot of um
[37:32] um ups and downs
[37:33] but we have to have them people have ups
[37:36] and downs and we all do because we're
[37:39] human
[37:40] but when are we going to get to a place
[37:42] to where that doesn't Spike so much this
[37:45] way are so much this way
[37:47] where they can come and be more like a
[37:49] wave instead of like a mountain and a
[37:51] and a and a valley and a mountain and a
[37:54] valley and a mountain in a valley that's
[37:56] what to me the Walk of God is when
[37:58] you're a Christian when you're a young
[37:59] Christian you absolutely uh they call it
[38:02] they call it tanking you tank out I mean
[38:04] you do
[38:05] you fail you think you're worthless you
[38:08] you start doing some of the things if
[38:09] you're not born again if you're just in
[38:11] justification to sanctification unclean
[38:13] Spirit goes out remember if you don't
[38:15] get something filled up fill it back up
[38:16] it's going to come right back in and
[38:18] you're going to do the same thing you
[38:19] did before
[38:21] and then you're like man this is worse
[38:23] I'm doing the same thing guess what
[38:26] keep going
[38:29] keep going get boring again keep setting
[38:31] under the fountain you keep sitting
[38:33] under the water it will get you wet
[38:38] don't leave it sit under it
[38:40] sit under a good message sit in a good
[38:43] congregation where people can help you
[38:45] where we can all help each other and not
[38:47] be a hindrance to each other
[38:50] in the New Testament and the
[38:51] characteristics of a man who is not
[38:53] swerved look from his deliberate purpose
[38:56] now you and I have got to have not just
[38:59] Faith but to be Christians anymore
[39:02] we gotta have faith for a body change we
[39:04] got to have faith for Resurrection we
[39:06] got to have faith to where we come to a
[39:08] spot to where the the prophet of God
[39:10] said Satan will not know what to do with
[39:13] you all would I want to have that place
[39:16] you wouldn't
[39:22] and his loyalty to what faith and piety
[39:24] by even the greatest trials and
[39:27] sufferings patiently steadfast James 1
[39:30] verse 2 says my brethren counted all joy
[39:33] when you fall into many Temptations
[39:36] how many of us has got that on their
[39:37] refrigerator no you don't
[39:40] you don't put that one up
[39:43] count it Joy when you fall into many
[39:45] Temptations knowing this that the trying
[39:48] of what this guy right down here the
[39:51] trying of your foundation
[39:56] worketh patience
[39:58] but let patience have her perfect work
[40:01] that you may be perfect an entire what
[40:04] wanting nothing
[40:05] do you believe that
[40:09] brother Brown said in Samaritan Church
[40:10] ages and now the Lord's Almighty says I
[40:12] know
[40:13] there he is walking in the midst of his
[40:15] people there he is the chief Shepherd of
[40:17] the flock but does he hold back the
[40:20] persecution does he stem the tribulation
[40:22] no he does not
[40:25] he simply says I know your tribulation I
[40:29] am not at all unmindful of your
[40:32] suffering what a stumbling block this is
[40:34] for so many people like Israel they
[40:37] wonder if God really loves them how can
[40:39] God be just and loving if he stands by
[40:40] and watches his people suffer that is
[40:43] what they said in Malachi 1 1-3 the
[40:45] burden of the word of the Lord to Israel
[40:47] by Malachi I have loved you saith the
[40:50] Lord yet we say wherein hath thou loved
[40:52] us was not Esau Jacob's brother saith
[40:55] the Lord yet I love Jacob and I hated
[40:57] Esau
[40:58] how did he do that by foreknowledge he
[41:01] knew what they'd be when they come out
[41:03] of the womb he knew what kind of nature
[41:04] they would have he knew what would
[41:06] motivate them and what motivated Esau
[41:09] was he didn't care anything about the
[41:11] birthright when God had made this big
[41:13] plan in the Old Testament that the
[41:15] birthright meant everything
[41:17] and then Esau is like I'm just hungry
[41:20] you know let's I just need something to
[41:22] eat Jacob would have seen the worser
[41:24] person but Esau gave away the one thing
[41:28] that God promised them that they could
[41:30] have and they would have all the
[41:32] possession
[41:33] was the birthright firstborn got
[41:35] everything
[41:37] and I hated Esau latest mountains in his
[41:39] Heritage waste for the dragons of the
[41:40] Wilderness you see they could not figure
[41:42] out God's love
[41:44] and if we see this too we you look at
[41:47] the people and I feel sorry for the
[41:49] people out in the world I was listening
[41:52] to the radio the other day and
[41:54] you know they they talk about the love
[41:55] of God well when they think about when
[41:57] they talk about the love of God it's
[41:58] like this greasy
[42:00] Grandpa
[42:02] you know don't worry about what you're
[42:04] wearing don't worry about all that Old
[42:06] Testament stuff you know and the uh
[42:08] don't worry just just God loves you
[42:12] his love
[42:15] is unconditional
[42:16] but our love back to him
[42:19] has conditions
[42:21] amen our look back to him he listen
[42:24] remember because he died for the whole
[42:26] world
[42:27] but watch what the prophet and watch he
[42:29] just brings us and and he covers it way
[42:31] better than I do because what they
[42:33] thought that love meant no suffering
[42:37] they thought you being a Christian all
[42:39] of a sudden all the lights in the house
[42:41] is going to be on the bills is going to
[42:43] quit coming your gas is always going to
[42:45] be full you didn't have a problem with
[42:47] your wife and your kids you know they
[42:49] always just perfect little angels wrong
[42:52] I don't know where you got that from
[42:54] they thought that love meant a baby with
[42:58] parental care
[43:00] this is not a baby with parental care
[43:03] this is the statue of a man
[43:06] a perfect man not a perfect baby
[43:10] they thought that love meant a baby with
[43:13] parental care but God said his love was
[43:16] elective love
[43:18] the proof of his love is election that
[43:21] no matter what happened his love was
[43:24] proven truly by the fact they were
[43:27] chosen unto salvation because God has
[43:30] chosen you to Salvation through
[43:31] sanctification of the spirit and belief
[43:33] the truth what you believe in the truth
[43:34] not him you believe in the truth so
[43:37] there's your condition you got to
[43:39] believe the truth he's not going to love
[43:40] you and you not do the truth
[43:43] he can't
[43:45] he may commit you to death
[43:49] as he did Paul
[43:52] he may commit you to suffering
[43:54] as he did job
[43:57] that is his prerogative you know why
[43:59] because he knows what he'll take to get
[44:01] you through
[44:03] he knows what he'll do to take you and
[44:05] break you through to become a better
[44:07] Christian
[44:08] he is Sovereign but watch this but it is
[44:11] all with a purpose
[44:14] if he did not have a purpose then he
[44:17] would be the author of frustration and
[44:20] not a peace
[44:22] his purpose is that after we have
[44:24] suffered a while
[44:27] we would be made perfect be established
[44:30] strengthened and settled as job said he
[44:32] put strength in US job 23 6. you may see
[44:35] himself
[44:37] suffered he learned obedience by the
[44:40] things that he suffered he was actually
[44:42] made perfect by the things that he
[44:44] suffered now how in the world are you
[44:46] and I going to be made perfect if he
[44:48] didn't
[44:48] I mean if we didn't and he did
[44:51] he didn't though he were a son yet he
[44:53] learned obedience by the things which he
[44:55] suffered and being made perfect he
[44:57] became what the author of what you're
[44:59] supposed to be the author of your book
[45:02] that's your book he can't he became the
[45:04] author of that he wrote that
[45:08] and being made perfect he became the
[45:10] author what is an author somebody writes
[45:13] a book that either has a personal
[45:14] experience if it's non-fiction or
[45:16] fiction something formulated in his mind
[45:18] God is Not non-fiction
[45:22] I mean he's not fiction sorry he is
[45:25] non-fiction thank you Bob I saw your
[45:27] face I knew you I said something wrong
[45:28] thank you
[45:30] he's not the author of a fictional book
[45:34] he's the author of non-fiction I'm sorry
[45:37] he became the author of Eternal
[45:39] salvation unto all them what no wait a
[45:42] minute condition
[45:45] unto all them that obey him
[45:50] in plain language brother Branham give
[45:52] us it in plain language right here the
[45:55] very character of Jesus was perfected by
[45:57] suffering
[45:59] wow
[46:00] oh he's the perfect one he's the sinless
[46:02] one yet that human body had to be
[46:05] perfected by the things that he suffered
[46:07] and according to Paul he has left his
[46:11] church a measure of suffering that they
[46:13] too by their faith in God while
[46:16] suffering for him
[46:18] I say one more time while suffering for
[46:22] him
[46:23] would come to a place of perfection
[46:26] why did he want this James 1 2 4. my
[46:29] brother encountered all joy we read that
[46:31] when you fall into many Temptations
[46:32] knowing this is trying your faith
[46:33] working patience but let patience have
[46:35] her perfect work
[46:37] why does he stand by the reason is
[46:40] Romans 8 verse 17.
[46:42] he explains it and if children then
[46:44] heirs
[46:45] if God suffered we suffer
[46:48] Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ
[46:51] if so be that we what suffer with him
[46:54] that we may also be glorified together
[46:58] for I reckon that the sufferings of this
[47:00] present time
[47:01] everybody say this present time
[47:05] are not worthy to be compared
[47:09] right with the glory that shall be
[47:12] revealed where in us he brings it right
[47:14] back down to us he's not gonna he didn't
[47:17] he didn't do something say well I I'm
[47:19] not going to be able to defend on this
[47:20] group so I'm gonna get me another group
[47:24] bride is bride always will be bride
[47:27] always was bride in his mind
[47:30] and it's mine always was pride in his
[47:33] mind in the back part of his mind the
[47:35] memory part of God
[47:37] you and I didn't know it we we didn't
[47:39] know one thing about being a bride when
[47:40] we were out in the world did you
[47:42] maybe a natural one but not a spiritual
[47:45] bride not headship our headship was you
[47:47] know who
[47:49] I'm not even gonna call his name
[47:52] that's who he was
[47:53] well I know some of you maybe not
[47:58] unless we suffer with him
[48:00] we cannot reign with him
[48:02] you have to suffer to Reign the reason
[48:04] for this is the character simply is
[48:06] never made without suffering character
[48:08] is a victory not a gift and character is
[48:11] not in the nine spiritual gifts
[48:14] if you have the nine spiritual gifts it
[48:16] will build your character
[48:18] and then you will be the Victorious but
[48:20] character is not in there that he just
[48:22] gives you character
[48:24] all right so he's not going to give you
[48:25] these virtues
[48:27] you got to fight for them
[48:31] a man without character look a man
[48:33] without character he can't reign
[48:37] he can't rule over anything How You
[48:39] Gonna rule over this if you don't have a
[48:41] right character
[48:43] because power apart from character is
[48:46] satanic but Power with character is fit
[48:49] to rule
[48:51] and since he wants us look he wants us
[48:54] to share his throne remember that's our
[48:57] that's our
[48:58] um mandate in in the loudest in church
[49:01] age remember to sit with me and my
[49:02] Throne as I sit with my father in his
[49:03] throne that's our mandate to sit there
[49:06] with him in the throne and since he
[49:09] wants us to share even his throne on the
[49:11] same basis look that he overcome and is
[49:13] sitting down in his father's room then
[49:15] we have to overcome to sit with him
[49:18] so now if you're going to sit with him
[49:20] you got to overcome what do you got to
[49:22] overcome you
[49:25] and a little
[49:27] brings that week through now
[49:29] is not worthy to be compared to the
[49:32] tremendous Glory that look will be
[49:34] revealed in us when he comes
[49:37] he is going to show let me tell you
[49:39] something he's going we think we might
[49:41] and people say well the bride looks bad
[49:43] the brides never look bad you're looking
[49:45] at the mixed multitude you're looking at
[49:46] the higher Parts I'm looking at a bride
[49:49] that he promised us without spot and
[49:50] wrinkle he promised us the power would
[49:52] come back into church he promised us the
[49:54] gifts would come back into church he
[49:56] promised us that we'd See Fire Fall Out
[49:58] of Heaven he promised that right that we
[50:01] see the pillar of fire we see it all the
[50:03] time but it's inside of us it's hid
[50:06] but it's not hid to me and you
[50:11] I'll promise you one thing
[50:13] if Satan's an angel of Light he can send
[50:16] you a Halo
[50:18] he can send you a light
[50:22] cause he's the angel of Light remember
[50:27] but I promise you one thing
[50:29] if you're born again
[50:30] that pillow fires inside of you and he
[50:33] can't replicate that
[50:35] he can't do it
[50:36] he tries best but he cannot get born
[50:39] again he cannot have that pillow fire in
[50:41] his soul
[50:42] like brother Chris was talking about the
[50:44] the that's what that was that burning
[50:46] bush that was the pillar of fire that's
[50:48] what came over today at Pentecost
[50:50] divided itself because it didn't have to
[50:51] divide itself it was talking to Moses it
[50:54] couldn't go into anybody it didn't even
[50:55] go into Moses
[50:57] he said I'll be with you
[50:58] but he told us he'd be in it so that all
[51:01] pillar fire became 120 little licks and
[51:05] then 3 000 little eggs and then he's
[51:07] been now into the millions and you and I
[51:09] when you get born again you get the same
[51:11] lick of Fire
[51:14] oh what Treasures are laid up for those
[51:16] who are willing
[51:19] well I'm just here I'm I clocked in
[51:25] I wonder if some of you already clocked
[51:27] out
[51:28] what Treasures are laid up for those who
[51:31] are willing to enter into his kingdom
[51:33] through much
[51:34] tribulation
[51:38] count it all joy
[51:41] when you fall into many Temptations
[51:46] that's your perfect man
[51:48] that's what we're supposed to do reflect
[51:51] the son of God
[51:53] and now we're supposed to do his work
[51:55] he that believeth on me John 14 7 he
[51:57] that believeth on me the works that I do
[51:59] shall he do also you're beginning to
[52:02] reflect the works of Christ
[52:05] but so many of us try to do the works of
[52:08] Christ before look the reflection of
[52:10] Christ is in US
[52:12] now there's the trouble
[52:15] we find these things happening you know
[52:17] it I know it we see these stumbles along
[52:19] the road we find the scrap heap of
[52:22] Ministers of Christians piled along the
[52:25] road is because they didn't go into it
[52:27] right
[52:29] remember there's a time and a place for
[52:31] everything
[52:32] all right
[52:34] then you can be overzealous
[52:38] that's why I'm here this morning is to
[52:40] try to teach this little church what if
[52:42] you're overzealous that means you ain't
[52:43] come to patience
[52:45] you want and everybody's wanting we're
[52:47] wanting to do things you know we're
[52:48] wanting to to get better and and maybe
[52:51] try to work up some emotions every once
[52:54] in a while because most of you are dead
[52:57] but we're trying to get it where
[52:58] somebody at least say Amen somebody at
[53:00] least they praise the Lord somebody at
[53:02] least act like you want to be here
[53:07] but that's patience
[53:09] brother I'm gonna read it here in just a
[53:10] minute brother Brian said I've been 33
[53:12] years in this pulpit and he said you
[53:14] women still cut your hair
[53:17] still do the things I tell you not to do
[53:19] the church my daddy's been here 50 years
[53:22] and you're still doing things we're all
[53:23] still doing things that he told us not
[53:25] to do that's why we're not moving
[53:29] oh we're moving
[53:30] but we're not moving like we should
[53:32] we've got the word of God here people
[53:35] where you where you can't take a strand
[53:38] of memory out of your head and say we
[53:40] were taught wrong
[53:45] we can't say oh we went through this
[53:48] Doctrine
[53:49] amen
[53:51] we went through this error
[53:55] so it should be easier
[53:57] for us to approach god with the true
[53:59] word of God that we do have and maybe I
[54:02] am trying to push it a little bit but
[54:04] somebody needs to get alive
[54:09] try to teach this little church and
[54:12] myself look brother Brown didn't he
[54:13] didn't disclose and bless God I'm all
[54:15] the way up here and I'm fixing to teach
[54:16] y'all that wasn't the prophet
[54:19] he said you and me
[54:22] how that we can become the dwelling
[54:24] place of the Living God
[54:27] how many would like to be that dwell in
[54:29] place of the Living God well there's
[54:31] things we have to do II Peter 3 verse 9
[54:34] says the Lord is not slack concerning
[54:36] his promises as some men count
[54:38] slightness but it's long-suffering to us
[54:40] we're not willing that any should perish
[54:42] but that all should come to repentance
[54:45] you look at all down through the church
[54:46] ages you look at all seven Church ages
[54:48] and you see that that that all but the
[54:50] end where we're at he said he said I
[54:53] love you and I appreciate this that
[54:55] you're doing but
[54:58] read it
[55:00] I appreciate that you don't take the D's
[55:02] of the Nickelodeon's but you've suffered
[55:04] this woman Jezebel but you fell from
[55:07] your first love but you've done this and
[55:09] you've done that so don't think I'm
[55:11] standing up here telling us you know
[55:12] telling us bad stuff God was telling him
[55:14] he said you fell away from me first love
[55:16] you quit doing this you suffered Jezebel
[55:18] you did these things but now remember
[55:20] the very last one number seven that
[55:22] we're in he just rebuked the whole thing
[55:29] why we should know better
[55:31] bear long suffer long be long suffering
[55:33] patiently enduring be of a long Spirit
[55:37] not to lose heart
[55:40] don't lose heart
[55:43] keep this thing going if it even just a
[55:45] little bitty Candlelight
[55:48] because if it's a candlelight of God
[55:50] it's worth more than ten thousand worlds
[55:53] to persevere patiently and bravely and
[55:57] enduring what
[55:59] misfortunes and troubles
[56:01] to be patient in bearing the offenses
[56:04] and injuries of others to be mild and
[56:07] slow to punish
[56:09] brother Brown tells us faith alone won't
[56:11] do it let's just keep going down here
[56:14] El Shady our 1960 brother Brian said
[56:16] then Abraham we find out didn't obey God
[56:17] just right
[56:19] wait a minute he's following our faith
[56:21] but he had errors
[56:23] he had things he had to deal with now he
[56:26] made ready and had faith in the promise
[56:28] but see we can still have faith in the
[56:31] promise every person sitting in the
[56:33] sound of my voice right now all of you
[56:35] sitting here believe that God sent a
[56:37] prophet
[56:38] believe that what he brought us was the
[56:41] pure unadulterated word of God Amen and
[56:44] it came straight from the Bible and
[56:47] there's no discrepancy there's no error
[56:50] banana
[56:52] we have faith in that promise
[56:54] and then not obey it
[56:57] still little hindrance
[56:59] I'm reading what the prophet that you
[57:01] just said you believe said
[57:04] now you say I believe in the Holy Spirit
[57:07] I believe I should be baptized with the
[57:09] Holy Spirit
[57:10] now no matter how much you believe
[57:12] you've got to obey that Commission
[57:15] what is the commission repent and be
[57:18] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[57:20] the mission he sins and you shall
[57:22] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[57:23] there's your promise because this
[57:24] promise is given to us and all ages and
[57:27] all
[57:29] nationalities I guess you might say the
[57:31] whole world
[57:32] but look just
[57:40] just that's right just like the
[57:41] borderline Believers got people today
[57:43] you find in the Bible says for is
[57:44] impossible for those which are once
[57:46] enlightened and may partake her to the
[57:48] Holy Ghost to fall away to renew
[57:50] themselves again unto repentance seeing
[57:51] that crucified to themselves the Son of
[57:54] God afresh and count the blood of the
[57:55] Covenant where when he was Sanctified an
[57:57] Unholy thing and done despite to the
[58:01] works of Grace you know what they're
[58:02] saying they're saying is Well I ain't I
[58:04] ain't perfect and you ain't perfect
[58:07] I I just I can't and I can't and I can't
[58:11] that's God there's no sacrifice for that
[58:14] there's a sacrifice for ignorance you
[58:17] know that right being ignorant is not
[58:19] knowing what you're doing
[58:21] so there's an offering for ignorance
[58:23] just like right now there's an offering
[58:25] for ignorance and it's patience
[58:27] an offering for ignorance is God's
[58:30] patience with me and you that we won't
[58:32] stay ignorant
[58:34] that will come to whatever we need to
[58:36] come to that will listen a little bit
[58:38] more study this a little bit more pray
[58:40] just a little bit more pray for things
[58:44] specific Pacific specific
[58:49] pray that I can speak
[58:51] look watch this it's a fearful thing to
[58:53] fall into the hands of a living God
[58:56] and those people you've seen them come
[58:57] to church they'll come and they'll say
[58:59] oh yes I believe yes sir but they
[59:01] believe it but they'll never lay their
[59:03] hands to it to turn one wheel to help it
[59:07] go on
[59:09] we still believe this is the prophet
[59:11] right I'm I'm not quoting Charles
[59:13] Stanley I'm quoting what brother Brown
[59:15] said in other words he sees this even in
[59:18] his own church
[59:20] they believe it but they'll never lay
[59:22] their hands to it to turn one wheel to
[59:25] help it go on and listen brother Brian
[59:27] ain't talking about well now I made four
[59:30] casseroles this past weekend and sister
[59:32] so-and-so just made two
[59:34] so I'm blessed more than she did than
[59:36] she is if you can't cook you're not
[59:41] but that's what he's saying he's not
[59:43] he's not saying okay we're like Roselle
[59:45] always says pave the parking lot and pay
[59:47] for this and pay it's now it's doing
[59:49] this it's doing the promise of God it's
[59:50] doing what God Said
[59:53] it's doing what God Said in the word of
[59:55] God now yes all that other peripheral
[59:57] that is so sweet and so nice and I
[59:59] appreciate you sisters and Men you do it
[1:00:01] without any reluctance you do it without
[1:00:03] any anything in you know malice in your
[1:00:06] heart
[1:00:07] but you can go to hell and still be
[1:00:09] doing that
[1:00:10] right that's not what God requires he
[1:00:12] does not require that
[1:00:15] he requires that you as brother around
[1:00:16] said you you do the things that God said
[1:00:18] to do
[1:00:20] I'm sorry that was a little bit cutting
[1:00:22] but if you think works is going to get
[1:00:24] you there not only works alone is not
[1:00:26] going to do it
[1:00:30] even paying your time's not going to get
[1:00:32] you in heaven
[1:00:33] it's an ordinance it's what you should
[1:00:35] do and you'll get a blessing because of
[1:00:37] it but it's not going to get you to
[1:00:39] heaven
[1:00:41] well now God just don't go over there
[1:00:43] and take a broom and sweep out the
[1:00:44] Canaanites and the amorites and Hittites
[1:00:46] and all of them sweep them out and say
[1:00:48] come on in Israel this is yours
[1:00:51] they've even planted crops for you no
[1:00:53] sir they had to fight for every inch of
[1:00:56] the way every inch that we fight we got
[1:00:59] to fight for it
[1:01:01] that's right but they had the promise of
[1:01:03] victory
[1:01:04] God told Joshua wherever The Souls of
[1:01:07] your foot tread that I have given you
[1:01:09] now remember they broke that promise
[1:01:12] through Aiken
[1:01:15] that promise was broken through Aiken
[1:01:18] because God told them you'll not lose
[1:01:20] one person in battle all of a sudden the
[1:01:22] first two or three battles was good and
[1:01:24] everything and all of a sudden they lost
[1:01:26] 12 or 14 men every how much that is in
[1:01:28] the Bible
[1:01:30] said hold on we've got an issue
[1:01:34] we got a problem we've got something in
[1:01:36] our in a camp that's not supposed to be
[1:01:38] here and you understand what happened
[1:01:40] Aiken stole the little or took the
[1:01:43] little garment in the wedge
[1:01:45] because that's not what God told him to
[1:01:46] do he said destroy it all get rid of it
[1:01:48] get rid of one of them don't have any of
[1:01:49] that stuff in your house
[1:01:51] so Footprints means possession remember
[1:01:53] that sister in the wheelchair Footprints
[1:01:55] means possession every time the sole of
[1:01:57] your feet touch that's it that's why God
[1:01:59] had to go to hell
[1:02:01] that's why Jesus Christ went to hell his
[1:02:04] Footprints he overcame he took over
[1:02:07] in hell because his feet was there
[1:02:11] then he come back on Earth and took over
[1:02:13] here all power and heaven and Earth's
[1:02:15] been given unto me
[1:02:16] that stirs my soul
[1:02:19] to know that that man's inside of us
[1:02:21] tonight he's in here he's not somewhere
[1:02:23] going well now wait a minute I'm just
[1:02:25] going to give you a little bit of me I
[1:02:26] ain't giving all of you no it's not what
[1:02:28] he said
[1:02:31] everywhere your
[1:02:33] touch
[1:02:34] take that much ground
[1:02:38] people fighting stuff like sister Freda
[1:02:40] get up stand on your feet put one foot
[1:02:42] forward and say cancer no not this part
[1:02:46] depression not this part
[1:02:49] you're not going in this part of my
[1:02:51] house
[1:02:52] even your physical house walk through
[1:02:54] your feet why do we why do we come up
[1:02:56] and and if you buy a new house what do
[1:02:58] we do sister Trudy what do we do we
[1:03:00] dedicate it we get into every piece of
[1:03:02] the house
[1:03:05] and we pray that God
[1:03:08] will be in the house
[1:03:09] that God will protect that house and we
[1:03:12] put prayer cloths in all different kind
[1:03:14] of places
[1:03:15] that's not Hocus Pocus
[1:03:17] I believe that works and I believe that
[1:03:21] we all maybe need a little checkup
[1:03:22] that's why I'm talking about uh having a
[1:03:24] marriage ceremony or we may even have to
[1:03:26] try let's try to go home and and like
[1:03:28] brother Randolph said get this out and
[1:03:29] get that out start with this one
[1:03:32] but physically we let things come in
[1:03:36] and what does it do it hinders
[1:03:39] our walk with God
[1:03:41] patience with what what kind of patience
[1:03:43] first thing is have patience with God if
[1:03:46] you've got real genuine faith you'll
[1:03:48] have real genuine patience because Faith
[1:03:51] worketh patience Faith worketh patience
[1:03:54] When You When God says anything you
[1:03:57] believe it that's all you got patience
[1:04:01] how many of us believe in Salvation in
[1:04:03] the room today
[1:04:04] we everyone should believe in Salvation
[1:04:06] even those you that don't want to raise
[1:04:07] your hand
[1:04:10] we believe in Salvation right all right
[1:04:13] now if we believe in Salvation then you
[1:04:15] believe anything whatever God says
[1:04:16] that's what it's going to be
[1:04:19] you believe it that's all you've got
[1:04:21] patience
[1:04:25] I have patience for my kids you want
[1:04:27] your kids to be here yes I do I want
[1:04:29] them all sitting here and I want you're
[1:04:30] sitting here too but we got to have
[1:04:32] patience that they'll come in a time
[1:04:34] that God sees to come but it
[1:04:38] rain
[1:04:39] they will come
[1:04:43] why God said so
[1:04:48] when did he tell you that Noah
[1:04:50] 120 years ago
[1:04:54] these numbers live that long just to
[1:04:56] clean his head in there but
[1:04:59] 120 years
[1:05:01] he believed in something though that had
[1:05:03] never happened see see we we built we we
[1:05:06] establish our faith listen to me a
[1:05:09] minute we established our faith on I
[1:05:12] know that brother Donnie was healed
[1:05:14] all right all right I know that brother
[1:05:17] George has salvation
[1:05:20] I know that sister Jean's going to be
[1:05:22] healed and I've seen y'all be healed
[1:05:24] I've seen you come to repentance I've
[1:05:26] seen you being baptized with water and
[1:05:28] then baptized with the Holy Ghost I've
[1:05:30] seen that so I can build on that no I
[1:05:34] had nothing
[1:05:36] the whole world was against him
[1:05:38] science was against him
[1:05:41] they might have had one of those
[1:05:42] telescopes that like Hubble or whatever
[1:05:45] it was
[1:05:46] and they could shoot that thing a
[1:05:47] million miles not one drop of water
[1:05:51] so Noah had to believe something that
[1:05:54] never happened before
[1:05:56] and he didn't believe it just for a few
[1:05:58] minutes he didn't believe me just a few
[1:05:59] days he believed 120 years worth of it
[1:06:03] what's wrong with us
[1:06:07] we find out God come this far waiting
[1:06:11] for the church too look brother I said
[1:06:13] but it'll be there don't you worry he
[1:06:16] promised it
[1:06:18] that's why I said you got to plug
[1:06:20] yourself into that though you can't just
[1:06:22] say I'm the church and not do what the
[1:06:24] church says I don't mean the church
[1:06:27] I mean the Bible
[1:06:29] the Bible is the church if it's the true
[1:06:31] church amen Isaiah 40 says hast thou not
[1:06:35] known hast thou not heard that the
[1:06:37] Everlasting God the Lord Capital Lord
[1:06:39] the creator of the ends of the Earth
[1:06:41] feigneth not neither is he weary there's
[1:06:45] no searching of his understanding
[1:06:49] he giveth power to the faint and to them
[1:06:52] to have no might he increases your
[1:06:55] strength
[1:06:56] that's a promise
[1:06:58] Lord I'm weak
[1:07:00] in my weakness he can be strong
[1:07:03] and help us to be that too
[1:07:05] even the youth shall faint and be weary
[1:07:09] and the young men shall utterly fall but
[1:07:12] they that wait upon the Lord
[1:07:15] shall renew their strength
[1:07:18] renew their strength
[1:07:21] they shall Mount up with wings as Eagles
[1:07:24] they shall run
[1:07:27] and not be weary
[1:07:29] see that's impossible
[1:07:31] to a human being
[1:07:34] the fastest people in the world can only
[1:07:36] run so far so fast so long
[1:07:39] you can't run for days
[1:07:43] but you he's promised that you'll run
[1:07:45] this race and not be weary
[1:07:47] they shall walk because sometimes you
[1:07:50] can run
[1:07:52] sometimes you gotta walk
[1:07:55] by faith
[1:07:57] and fight not
[1:08:01] perseverance 1962 brother Brown said the
[1:08:03] trouble of it with we people we're in
[1:08:06] too much of a hurry
[1:08:08] it's just got to be done right now now
[1:08:10] listen he was living in a Crock-Pot age
[1:08:14] we're living in an Ultra
[1:08:17] instapot Instagram
[1:08:20] s to that microwave in 10 seconds is hot
[1:08:24] that's what we're living in now he
[1:08:26] wasn't living in that but he knew it was
[1:08:27] coming
[1:08:30] see that's what surprises a lot of
[1:08:32] people you take John Wesley his mother
[1:08:35] had watched 17 kids
[1:08:37] right wasn't it 17 kids or whatever more
[1:08:39] it was either him his wife or his mother
[1:08:41] and
[1:08:43] had to wash all 17 kids clothes
[1:08:50] didn't have a Westinghouse washing
[1:08:53] machine
[1:08:54] she was the washing machine
[1:08:57] and she hung him out on the dryer out in
[1:09:00] the in the yard to drive let me remember
[1:09:03] remember that
[1:09:04] praise the Lord some of us are still in
[1:09:06] our sanity
[1:09:07] foreign
[1:09:09] by and it looked like Flags it'd be
[1:09:12] everybody's anyway
[1:09:15] but that's what she did
[1:09:18] it wasn't throwing in the dryer and 20
[1:09:20] minutes later it's all fluffed it's all
[1:09:22] wrinkle free and you just fold it up and
[1:09:25] put it in the in the closet she had to
[1:09:28] iron
[1:09:29] the clothes and she had enough time to
[1:09:31] stop and teach her kids about God
[1:09:34] yeah get quiet on me that's okay it hits
[1:09:36] all of us the trouble of it is we people
[1:09:39] were too much of a hurry it's just got
[1:09:41] right now
[1:09:45] right now see when you get that in your
[1:09:46] mind you're going to lose it right there
[1:09:50] you're going on losing ground right
[1:09:53] there you have nothing to stand on you
[1:09:56] must be patient
[1:09:58] brother I'm in an uncertain uncertain
[1:10:00] sound
[1:10:01] I know of being warned of God moved and
[1:10:03] prepare the ark we just talked about
[1:10:04] that and God said it's going to rain and
[1:10:06] it rained those who found a way of
[1:10:08] Escape took it those who didn't perish
[1:10:10] that same God said it'll rain fire is
[1:10:13] going to fall from Heaven and destroy
[1:10:14] this world and there was a way prepared
[1:10:16] for you
[1:10:18] those who will take it will escape it
[1:10:21] those who will not will perish The
[1:10:23] Sinner will perish with the sinful world
[1:10:25] but the redeemed will be redeemed by the
[1:10:28] Holy Spirit and he's talking about Noah
[1:10:30] standing at the door
[1:10:31] remember telling people something that
[1:10:34] they did not even believe in they didn't
[1:10:36] know anything what is rain they probably
[1:10:37] didn't have rain in their dictionary bro
[1:10:39] John
[1:10:41] because they didn't know what it was
[1:10:44] the water was coming up out of the
[1:10:45] ground and it was you know watering
[1:10:47] everything up from the viaducts
[1:10:48] underneath the ground
[1:10:49] because that's what collapsed when the
[1:10:52] water started raining down that's what
[1:10:54] collapsed to make all the water on the
[1:10:57] Earth
[1:10:58] so everything they needed was right
[1:10:59] there so they didn't have to look up me
[1:11:02] and you
[1:11:04] nothing down here
[1:11:07] it's all got to be from up there
[1:11:10] don't look to the earth look to the
[1:11:12] heavens
[1:11:14] we should have patience with one another
[1:11:15] like I've tried to get this watch I've
[1:11:18] tried to get this message over at the
[1:11:19] Tabernacle to see that each member of
[1:11:21] the Tabernacle become this
[1:11:24] it's hard to do I've tried to have
[1:11:27] patience this is 33 years have patience
[1:11:30] women still Bob their hair still just
[1:11:32] the same but just have patience see just
[1:11:35] have patience wait you have to if you
[1:11:38] ain't got it don't try to build on this
[1:11:40] down here have patience
[1:11:42] Hebrews 12 verse 1 it says wherefore
[1:11:44] seeing will also compass with this great
[1:11:46] a cloud of witness let us lay aside
[1:11:48] every weight and the sin which does
[1:11:50] easily beset us and let us what run with
[1:11:53] patience
[1:11:54] the race that is set before us looking
[1:11:57] unto Jesus the author and finish of our
[1:11:59] faith listen we know the plan
[1:12:01] we know the plan more than Paul did
[1:12:06] we're in the end time he was in the
[1:12:08] first time
[1:12:09] but he could see it that we needed to
[1:12:11] make sure we run with patience to race
[1:12:13] that was set before us looking unto
[1:12:15] Jesus the author and finish of our faith
[1:12:17] who for the joy that was set before him
[1:12:19] endured the cross despising the shame
[1:12:21] and is set down at the right hand of the
[1:12:23] Throne of God Matthew 10 verse 22 says
[1:12:26] and you shall be hated of all men for my
[1:12:28] name's sake but he that what endureth
[1:12:31] he that endureth to the end shall be
[1:12:34] saved that word endureth means to remain
[1:12:37] abide not recede or flee not first time
[1:12:41] something happens first time somebody
[1:12:43] says something crossed to you first time
[1:12:44] somebody looks at you different now or
[1:12:47] somebody gets on your steps on your toes
[1:12:49] don't recede or flee
[1:12:52] remain abide
[1:12:55] preserve look under misfortunes and
[1:12:58] trials hold fast to one's faith in
[1:13:00] Christ
[1:13:01] to indeed endure to Bear bravely and
[1:13:04] look calmly
[1:13:07] ill treatments
[1:13:09] the word in men's means the end to which
[1:13:12] all things relate the aim or the purpose
[1:13:14] I told you about God what is the plan a
[1:13:18] plan is a method of achieving an end
[1:13:21] we're trying to achieve an end listen
[1:13:23] and God's going to have it doesn't
[1:13:25] matter you can sit here today and you
[1:13:27] can clam up and you can be a sourpuss
[1:13:29] all you want to somebody's going to have
[1:13:31] the quickening power and going to take
[1:13:33] this thing and sweep it on I'm just dumb
[1:13:36] enough to believe it's me and you
[1:13:37] all right so get it let's get out of
[1:13:39] this doldrum what let's get into what
[1:13:41] God's already given us
[1:13:46] and pray for what's coming
[1:13:51] because with God it can't be less
[1:13:54] it's got to be greater
[1:13:56] that you'd be not slothful but followers
[1:13:59] of them who through look who through
[1:14:00] faith and patience inherit the promises
[1:14:04] for when God made promise to Abraham
[1:14:06] because he could swear no greater swear
[1:14:07] by himself
[1:14:08] saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee
[1:14:10] multiplying I will multiply the end so
[1:14:12] look so after he had patiently endured
[1:14:15] after Abraham waited 25 years he
[1:14:19] obtained the promise
[1:14:21] Luke 21 19 says in your patience
[1:14:25] possess you your soul
[1:14:27] it is well
[1:14:29] with My Soul
[1:14:31] when peace like a river
[1:14:34] extendeth my way
[1:14:36] when Sorrows like seize Bellows roll
[1:14:41] nevertheless why it is well
[1:14:44] with My Soul
[1:14:46] I have patience to believe that God's
[1:14:50] going to do what he said to do
[1:14:53] so let's look at godliness just for a
[1:14:54] minute and then we'll close
[1:14:56] godliness and strongs is holiness
[1:14:59] reverence and respect you would not you
[1:15:02] would not think that much but think just
[1:15:04] bear with me and I'll get to it I may be
[1:15:07] Sunday reverence and respect
[1:15:10] all right piety towards God God now look
[1:15:13] how can you be piety towards God
[1:15:17] is piety
[1:15:19] we're born in sand
[1:15:22] to be to have piety towards God is to
[1:15:24] know what that is by that person being
[1:15:26] inside of me or being inside of you
[1:15:29] that's why brother Brown said we'll read
[1:15:30] in just a minute he said you go all
[1:15:32] through this but
[1:15:34] when you got to get up to the top you're
[1:15:36] getting some really good material
[1:15:38] let me tell you this is just kind of
[1:15:40] like what we read at Corinthians this is
[1:15:42] what Paul was dealing with he's dealing
[1:15:44] with it in Timothy he was dealing with
[1:15:45] in the Corinthians he comes among people
[1:15:47] he says for men shall be lovers of their
[1:15:49] own selves Covetous boasters proud
[1:15:51] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[1:15:53] unthankful and Unholy without natural
[1:15:56] affection
[1:15:57] Lord Jesus we see that now more than
[1:15:59] ever
[1:16:01] we took a little survey today me and
[1:16:03] June did and we gave some blood for a
[1:16:06] for a uh a test or something they were
[1:16:09] doing about
[1:16:10] um stuff in the past anyway it said on
[1:16:13] there it says are you male or female but
[1:16:15] it said what did it say it said
[1:16:16] something about
[1:16:18] your birth
[1:16:20] sex
[1:16:23] were you born male or female
[1:16:25] do you identify that's right what do you
[1:16:28] identify as
[1:16:32] without natural affection
[1:16:35] truce Breakers false accusers
[1:16:37] incontinent you know what that means
[1:16:39] that means you can't keep your mouth
[1:16:40] shut
[1:16:41] Fierce despisers of those that are good
[1:16:45] Traders heavy high-minded lovers of
[1:16:48] pleasure
[1:16:49] more than lovers of God
[1:16:51] having a form now that's a form you
[1:16:53] don't want
[1:16:55] but having a form of godliness but
[1:16:57] denying the power of that godliness if
[1:17:01] we don't come to Godliness and show the
[1:17:03] power of it you know what it is it's
[1:17:05] that right there
[1:17:07] you lose it a form but denying the power
[1:17:10] thereof
[1:17:12] power without character is satanic
[1:17:17] for this sword are they which creep into
[1:17:19] houses and Lead captive silly women or
[1:17:21] churches or denominations or us if we're
[1:17:24] that part silly women Laden with sins
[1:17:26] LED away with many lusts in other words
[1:17:29] watching it looking for everything else
[1:17:31] ever learning and never able to come to
[1:17:33] the knowledge
[1:17:34] the truth now let's read this again
[1:17:36] first Timothy and without controversy
[1:17:38] without us even having to argue about it
[1:17:41] great is the mystery of godliness God
[1:17:44] was manifested in the flesh we know
[1:17:46] where he's at now though
[1:17:48] amen we know where he's at
[1:17:52] we don't have to go find him and there's
[1:17:54] no controversy that he's in a Bible or
[1:17:57] he's in a church or he's in a pope
[1:18:01] he's in me and you
[1:18:04] buy the new birth God was manifested in
[1:18:06] the flesh justified in the spirit scene
[1:18:07] of angels priests unto the Gentiles
[1:18:10] that's us believed on in the world and
[1:18:12] received up into Glory
[1:18:14] brother Brown says in the Statue of
[1:18:16] perfect man but if you got genuine Faith
[1:18:17] then put genuine virtue to it then
[1:18:20] genuine knowledge then genuine
[1:18:22] Temperance then genuine patience see
[1:18:23] you're moving right on up the line all
[1:18:26] right
[1:18:27] fifthly add godliness oh my godliness to
[1:18:31] be added what does godliness mean I
[1:18:34] looked in four or five dictionaries
[1:18:35] couldn't even find what he meant finally
[1:18:37] I was down to brother Jeffrey's there
[1:18:39] and we found it in a dictionary
[1:18:40] godliness means to be like God
[1:18:44] oh my after you got faith first and all
[1:18:46] his temper's patience then be like God
[1:18:49] you say I can't do that brother Branham
[1:18:52] oh yes you can
[1:18:56] let me just read you a few scriptures
[1:18:58] here in a minute Matthew 5 48.
[1:19:00] and let's see what
[1:19:02] Jesus said you're gods
[1:19:06] all the virtue all the things that's in
[1:19:09] God is in you
[1:19:11] do you believe that
[1:19:13] Matthew 5 48 be Jesus speaking and
[1:19:16] Beatitudes be there for p-e-r-f-e-c-t
[1:19:19] what's that perfect even as your father
[1:19:21] in Heaven is perfect you got way up here
[1:19:24] now before you're asked to do that
[1:19:27] he didn't ask you to be like God at
[1:19:29] virtue
[1:19:32] you need to have strength before you can
[1:19:34] be like God
[1:19:36] then when you get up here he's asked you
[1:19:39] now to be perfect
[1:19:42] godliness Sons and Daughters of God
[1:19:45] that's right how many things could I say
[1:19:46] on that line then he turns says turn to
[1:19:49] Ephesians 4 it's kind of a long quote
[1:19:50] but we'll finish right here on this
[1:19:51] let's turn to Ephesians 4 and find out
[1:19:53] here in the book of Ephesians it says
[1:19:56] about these things how what we should do
[1:19:58] 4 and 12. you know where he's going with
[1:20:01] this begin with the 12th verse all right
[1:20:03] let's begin up here at the 11th verse
[1:20:05] and he gave some Apostles and some
[1:20:07] prophets remember last night don't try
[1:20:09] to take the other man's office see and
[1:20:11] some evangelists and some pastors and
[1:20:13] some teachers for the perfecting of God
[1:20:16] does it read like that congregation says
[1:20:19] no
[1:20:19] the Perfection of what they said Saints
[1:20:22] who are the Saints the Sanctified ones
[1:20:26] not Sanctified before you get born again
[1:20:29] this is Sanctified after you get born
[1:20:32] again
[1:20:33] after me Born Again Chief which one wins
[1:20:38] he said the one I feed because they got
[1:20:40] one out here in my spirit realm that's a
[1:20:42] black dog but I've got one inside of me
[1:20:44] that's a white dog now there's a
[1:20:46] contrast
[1:20:48] now there's a fight going on it's not
[1:20:50] down in your soul
[1:20:53] the Sanctified ones amen the ones
[1:20:55] started from down here

[1:21:09] the faith and the knowledge of the Son
[1:21:11] of God and to the perfect man unto the
[1:21:14] Assurance to the measure of the stature
[1:21:16] of the fullness of Christ invisible

[1:21:20] man is born of God
[1:21:22] a Son of God look has to have the nature
[1:21:25] of God

[1:22:42] but what have we done with reading of
[1:22:44] the word of God that never says now it
[1:22:46] tells you that there's a position that
[1:22:48] you got into
[1:22:50] by your first birth that you are not
[1:22:52] perfect
[1:22:53] but by your new birth it's made you as
[1:22:56] perfect as God is
[1:22:59] right so you got to let that out and let
[1:23:01] it go to working let it out

[1:23:08] happen in this end time in a group of

[1:30:23] positive promise there is nothing
[1:30:26] negative in God he's not an oh oh it's
[1:30:28] me God he's not a I can't do it God this
[1:30:31] is just too much I can't do it he's
[1:30:33] never said that he's always had a
[1:30:36] provision he's always had a way for us
[1:30:38] to be healed or to be saved or or we
[1:30:42] were talking this past weekend you know
[1:30:44] there's only one way you can't go to
[1:30:47] heaven
[1:30:48] one way
[1:30:50] and that's blaspheming the Holy Ghost
[1:30:52] and count it to be not
[1:30:55] because I read you a list of people that
[1:30:58] should be in hell
[1:30:59] [Music]
[1:31:01] adulterers Liars thieves murderers and
[1:31:05] they won't enter in the state they're in
[1:31:07] here but when they get a change
[1:31:11] it's not a Salvation issue if you murder
[1:31:13] three or four people and you get saved
[1:31:15] and filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:31:16] okay
[1:31:18] wow you think no that's too much
[1:31:21] have we belittled God so much that you
[1:31:24] know you say and the reason I'm saying
[1:31:25] that is you say well my kids have done X
[1:31:28] [Music]
[1:31:31] as long as you hang on to them you just
[1:31:34] keep hanging on to them
[1:31:36] I'm like brother Claude weisinger said
[1:31:38] he said look God he said I want my kids
[1:31:41] saved I don't care if it's the last he
[1:31:43] said give them one minute if they're
[1:31:46] dying give them one minute Lord to make
[1:31:49] a choice and let them make that choice
[1:31:52] Lord save my filthy soul and you know
[1:31:55] what he'll do he'll come down save them
[1:31:57] amen we let God handle that but you know
[1:32:01] what I don't deathbed confessions are
[1:32:03] just too close to the they're too close
[1:32:05] to the uh to the finish line
[1:32:08] okay let's get it now and not worry
[1:32:11] about it then when we go home if we have
[1:32:13] to go home by death we go home with a
[1:32:15] smile we go home with a wow
[1:32:18] is that what this is all about
[1:32:21] is that heaven
