[2:37] on their way be with us now Lord we pray
[2:40] in your name
[2:42] amen now I just want to take a little
[2:44] topic this morning the Jubilee sound and
[2:47] read from Exodus 21 and Leviticus 25 and
[2:50] exodus 21:1 says now these are the
[2:53] judgments which Thou shalt set before
[2:55] them if thou buy an Hebrew servant six
[2:58] years He Shall Serve and in the seventh
[3:00] he shall go out free for nothing if he
[3:02] came in by himself he shall go out by
[3:04] himself if he were married then his wife
[3:07] shall go out with him if his ma if his
[3:09] master hath given him a wife and she
[3:11] have borne him Sons or daughters the
[3:13] wife and her children shall be her
[3:14] Masters and he shall go out by himself
[3:17] and if the servant shall plainly say I
[3:19] love my master my wife and my children I
[3:21] will not go out for I will not go out
[3:23] free then his master shall bring him
[3:25] unto the judges he shall also bring him
[3:27] to the door or unto the door and his
[3:30] master shall bore his ear through with
[3:32] an awe and he shall serve him forever
[3:35] and Leviticus 25:8
[3:38] reads if you're able to flip over to
[3:40] Leviticus 25:8 it says Thou shalt number
[3:44] seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven
[3:46] time seven years and the space of the
[3:49] seven sabbaths of years shall be unto
[3:51] thee 40 and9 years then sht thou cause
[3:54] the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on
[3:56] the 10th day of the seventh month and
[3:58] the day of atonement shall you make the
[4:00] trumpet sound throughout all your land
[4:02] and you shall hallow the 50th year and
[4:05] Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land
[4:07] and to all the inhabitants thereof it
[4:09] shall be a jubilee unto you and ye shall
[4:12] return every man unto his possession and
[4:15] you shall return every man unto his
[4:17] family you may be seated the Lord at his
[4:19] Blessing to the reading of the
[4:22] word now I think I I I think this
[4:25] morning uh we were actually we seems
[4:28] like we've been traveling a lot L lately
[4:30] and we've been we were traveling up
[4:32] north and we we were listening to an
[4:33] audio book about the the history of
[4:36] George Washington and the how the nation
[4:37] was founded and just listening to how
[4:40] the the uh the I guess you'd say the
[4:43] old-timers the ones that the founding
[4:46] fathers um all that they fought for to
[4:49] give us Liberty from the the tyranny of
[4:52] British rule and and to establish the uh
[4:54] colonies and all those kind of things
[4:56] you begin to think about what we what we
[4:58] have now that we we're able able to live
[4:59] in Freedom and able to believe the way
[5:01] we we want to and and uh so freedom is
[5:04] certainly a great thing and to think
[5:07] this these little scriptures that we're
[5:09] reading this morning are about Freedom
[5:12] the devil you know has so many people
[5:14] Bound in a uh Bound in the Captivity of
[5:16] their mind and mind battles and you
[5:19] could list off so many things but you
[5:21] know maybe maybe this morning if we
[5:22] really examine ourselves maybe the
[5:23] devil's got you bound this morning so
[5:26] you know you hear that gospel the gospel
[5:28] sound the Jubilee sound that that you
[5:29] have a right to go free and um you know
[5:34] uh brother in Genesis chter 15 it says
[5:36] in the same day the Lord made a covenant
[5:38] with Abraham saying unto thy seed have I
[5:39] given this land from the river of Egypt
[5:41] unto the Great River the river Euphrates
[5:44] so we've got a promise now that we've
[5:45] got a promise that Abraham's natural
[5:47] seed had a promise that all that land
[5:49] was given to him but we've got a promise
[5:51] spiritually that Abraham's seed by
[5:54] Christ the the the the faith seed that
[5:56] we because we're in Christ we have a we
[5:58] have an inheritance that we have access
[6:00] to that in other words we don't have to
[6:03] be bound by the devil anymore we don't
[6:05] have to be bound by what the devil is
[6:07] putting on us that you got an
[6:09] inheritance this morning that you can
[6:11] possess that you can have access to now
[6:13] you know so many times people people
[6:15] don't realize and that's what the gospel
[6:17] was given for people don't realize that
[6:19] that they're living uh under bondage to
[6:21] the devil that you know you you you
[6:24] certainly we've if you've been delivered
[6:26] you can look with discernment at at
[6:27] people at Walmart and people there that
[6:29] you go to work with and see that the the
[6:31] their way that they their language is
[6:33] they're cussing constantly and uh I know
[6:36] people that I work with they can't have
[6:37] happiness without drinking that Corona
[6:40] at the end of the day drinking that beer
[6:41] and and and they don't they just don't
[6:43] have they don't realize that they're in
[6:45] bondage oh to think that you can't have
[6:47] H to not be able to have happiness
[6:49] without the devil giving you his little
[6:51] his little peill or his little bottle or
[6:53] something that they can't have happiness
[6:54] without going to Las Vegas and getting
[6:56] all into that you see what the devil
[6:58] does is he gets you in bondage
[7:00] and and and they don't realize it oh but
[7:02] then you hear that gospel sound the
[7:03] gospel the gospel trumpet the the voice
[7:05] of God preached across the pulpit to
[7:07] tell you that you don't have to be B
[7:09] Bound by the what the devil's got over
[7:11] you that you can you can be loosed from
[7:13] all of that then then things begin to
[7:15] change see God gave is Israel a
[7:18] possession and he gave you a possession
[7:21] now you might have to fight for
[7:22] everything that you're going to ever get
[7:23] you might have to fight for it you might
[7:25] have to take up your sword like Caleb
[7:26] did who said Give me my Mountain but but
[7:29] still nevertheless God give it to you if
[7:31] you're willing to go after it now
[7:33] brother R said in the message adoption
[7:35] he said inheritance by predestination I
[7:38] inherited something what inheritance
[7:40] there had to be somebody leave me an
[7:42] inheritance why you say Jesus left you
[7:44] an inheritance beg your pardon Jesus
[7:47] never left me an inheritance Jesus Jesus
[7:49] never left you an inheritance he only
[7:51] came down and paid for your inheritance
[7:54] brought you to your inheritance oh to
[7:56] think about that this morning that to
[7:57] think that you got an inheritance
[8:00] sitting here this morning you've got
[8:01] access to what to to all these promises
[8:04] that God laid out for us that they are
[8:06] yours that he promised that you can have
[8:09] it he said your name was put on the
[8:11] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[8:13] foundation of the world God give your
[8:15] your inheritance your inheritance was
[8:18] first all to think of that you go way
[8:20] back in the mind of God that he was
[8:21] thinking about you he was thinking about
[8:24] what he wanted you to have before the
[8:26] world was created before the Angels were
[8:28] created he was thinking about you
[8:29] thinking about you sitting in this
[8:31] church service this morning and thinking
[8:32] about thinking about the power of the
[8:34] Holy Ghost he was going to give in your
[8:35] life thinking about overcoming power
[8:37] that he was going to give you and
[8:39] thinking about that he wanted to bring
[8:40] you up to a maturity where you didn't
[8:42] have to take nothing from the devil no
[8:44] more that you could give it back to him
[8:46] now in other words before there was a
[8:48] world before there was anything there
[8:50] was a God and you are part of that God
[8:53] by the new birth that you to think now
[8:57] that's what your inheritance is that you
[8:58] can be a part you're a part of that God
[9:01] before the foundation of the world now
[9:03] that's what Jesus Come To Die to not to
[9:05] bring you an inheritance but to bring
[9:06] you back to that to pay the way so that
[9:09] you could be restored back to that
[9:12] inheritance oh to think to think this
[9:14] morning maybe you're wondering what's
[9:15] what can I have access to God promised
[9:17] it God promised he promised the
[9:19] Israelites that all that land that they
[9:21] could he promised Abraham everywhere you
[9:24] put your foot you can have it and he
[9:26] promised that same thing to you whatever
[9:28] wherever you could put your foot by
[9:30] faith you can have it you can have it
[9:32] this morning if you need healing you can
[9:33] have it if you need a baptism of the
[9:35] Holy Ghost you can have it if you need
[9:37] eternal life you can have it if you need
[9:39] overcoming power this morning you can
[9:41] have it why because he promised it and
[9:44] now now we've got a we've got a heavenly
[9:46] father that when he makes a promise he
[9:48] doesn't just make it just to be saying
[9:50] words but he makes it he's going to
[9:52] stand behind everything that he says
[9:54] he's going to stand by his promise he
[9:55] said I'm not going to set my word is not
[9:57] going to go out and return return void
[10:00] it's not going to fall to the ground
[10:01] it's not it's going to accomplish its
[10:03] purpose so this morning God is looking
[10:05] for a little some good ground with that
[10:06] seed of the word can fall in somebody
[10:08] that will say if God promised it I want
[10:10] to take God at his promise I want to
[10:12] accept
[10:13] it now you think now brother R said in a
[10:16] type or figure we take Israel because
[10:18] it's the Jubilee time and the church was
[10:20] given a portion which was Christ himself
[10:23] that was poured out by the Holy Spirit
[10:24] into each heart that would receive it
[10:26] and become sons of God or to think now
[10:28] this morning that you got a starting
[10:30] place just like the children of Israel
[10:31] when they were covered over by the blood
[10:33] and that and and and they were HD away
[10:34] and they as they were eating the lamb
[10:36] there before they started on their
[10:37] journey and they you got a starting
[10:40] point just like they had a starting
[10:41] point but the starting point is not
[10:43] where God wants you to end up he didn't
[10:45] want them to just stay down in Egypt he
[10:47] wanted them to go through all the all
[10:49] the Wilderness Journeys and wind up in
[10:50] the promised land and battle it out with
[10:52] the Philistines and the amorites and the
[10:54] moabites until they accomplished
[10:56] everything that God saw that they would
[10:58] have possession of and B drive out the
[11:01] Giants oh see you got Giants in your
[11:03] life too you got giants that are
[11:05] fighting against you and God wants you
[11:06] to have faith and confidence enough in
[11:08] what he promised to drive out every
[11:11] giant to take up your sword of the word
[11:13] and the shield of faith and to drive out
[11:15] everything that's coming against you and
[11:18] brother BR said when those children were
[11:19] born when the when the baby was born all
[11:22] all the uh the the all the the children
[11:25] of Jacob uh Abraham Isaac and Jacob he
[11:28] said when the baby was born and the
[11:30] mother labored utter the voice of this
[11:32] patriarch it positioned and placed him
[11:34] in his in his place in Palestine
[11:36] hundreds of years later oh to think now
[11:39] when you were born you come forth crying
[11:41] Abba Father you come forth with the
[11:43] spirit the spirit of adoption why cuz
[11:45] the spirit of adoption cried ABA father
[11:48] cuz God wanted you to be positionally
[11:50] placed what positionally placed in his
[11:54] word where the word grabs a hold of your
[11:56] life and puts you right where God wants
[11:57] you and where does God wants you to be
[11:59] this morning he don't want you to just
[12:00] be a little baby be he wants to be he
[12:02] wants you to be a mature grownup
[12:04] Christian that can take God at his word
[12:07] and say say I I believe every word in
[12:09] other words I believe that all things
[12:11] are possible that's what God wants us to
[12:14] be built up in the faith precept upon
[12:16] precept line upon line here a little
[12:18] there a little until we believe that
[12:20] when God said it he's going to back it
[12:22] up he said he brother Bown said you
[12:25] Lutheran that believe in justification
[12:27] your inheritance don't lay there if
[12:29] you're called oh God wants us to keep
[12:31] moving on he said if you're just a
[12:33] Lutheran that's all the farther you get
[12:36] you Methodist and nazarenes and Pilgrim
[12:38] Holiness and Church of God who believe
[12:40] in sanctification the killing of the
[12:42] evil that's se you taking out the roots
[12:44] of evil oh what he say you belong across
[12:47] the river to think about this morning
[12:49] that that they thought that they that
[12:50] was good enough what they had he said
[12:53] that's why Pentecost failed because they
[12:54] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[12:56] they failed to keep going but God said I
[12:58] I want you cross the river I want you to
[13:00] take possession I want you to be eating
[13:02] that new that old corner of the land I
[13:04] want you to be eating the God wants us
[13:06] to get into the Mysteries get into get
[13:09] into Rapture building messages he said
[13:13] but to you men and women that there's
[13:14] something in you calling out the Deep to
[13:17] the Deep there's a Jordan yet to cross
[13:20] and a land beyond the river and adoption
[13:23] number two he said did you notice Moses
[13:25] that great miracle performer that
[13:27] brought down Israel down through the
[13:28] land
[13:29] and brought them up to the promised land
[13:30] but did not Place their inheritance to
[13:32] them he did not give them their
[13:34] inheritance he led them up to the land
[13:36] but Joshua divided the land to the
[13:38] people and Christ brought the church up
[13:40] to the place to where their possession
[13:42] was made to them was given to them just
[13:44] the Jordan the cross but the holy spirit
[13:46] is the one who sets the church in order
[13:48] the Joshua of today puts the church in
[13:50] its order given to each one gifts places
[13:53] position how does it set the church in
[13:55] order oh as we hear the word we're
[13:58] getting under subjection to the word and
[14:00] it's sliding us into place it's telling
[14:03] Housewives how to be a good Housewives
[14:05] it's telling husbands how to be a good
[14:06] husband it's telling a father how to be
[14:08] a good father it's telling us how do we
[14:10] need to be B baptized that we need to be
[14:12] born again it's telling us that we need
[14:13] to grow in Grace and knowledge it's
[14:15] telling us we got to be adopted that
[14:16] there's more to add it's telling us how
[14:18] to do all these things it's telling us
[14:20] what is the evidence of the new birth
[14:22] and as we get under the word it's
[14:23] putting us right where right where we're
[14:26] supposed to be positionally placed the
[14:28] word is placing us the word is what is
[14:31] claiming our lives and moving us into
[14:33] position where it wants us to be oh you
[14:36] you realize what a a believer in
[14:38] subjection to the word what power it has
[14:40] over the devil where you can stand in
[14:42] confidence knowing that knowing you know
[14:44] where you come from and you know where
[14:46] you're going cuz why you know who your
[14:47] daddy is and any belever any real Son of
[14:50] God that knows who their daddy is they
[14:52] got confidence that they're dad will
[14:53] back up his word they've got confidence
[14:56] they can they can believe what he said
[14:59] oh that's the kind of position that the
[15:00] church wants to that God wants the
[15:02] church to be in he wants the church to
[15:04] be to be to have faith their faith to
[15:07] build up where they just believe that no
[15:09] matter what the devil throws at them
[15:11] that God is able why cuz he promised it
[15:14] and brother ra said he is the voice of
[15:16] God speaking to the inner man that
[15:17] Christ has saved the Holy Spirit now do
[15:19] you get that much of it he said now
[15:21] we're getting over into the book of
[15:22] Ephesians the same way he's positionally
[15:24] plac in the church where they belong
[15:26] Joshua placed them in the natural land
[15:29] now the holy spirit is placing the
[15:31] church positionally in the land that
[15:33] they and the position that they belong
[15:34] in their inheritance oh you see what
[15:37] your inheritance is this morning your
[15:39] inheritance is not just a drop of the
[15:41] Holy Ghost your God wants to just feel
[15:43] every fiber of your being with the Holy
[15:45] Ghost he wants to fill every fiber of
[15:46] your being with his word he wants to
[15:48] just just build you up so that God can
[15:52] become God could just Tabernacle himself
[15:54] in you oh that's what that's what we're
[15:56] talking about here they started off on
[15:58] this journey down to the bottom but they
[16:00] had been to move and what was it the
[16:01] Holy Ghost placing them till the Holy
[16:04] Ghost to take them across the river and
[16:06] put them in the promised land and
[16:07] positionally place him where in maturity
[16:10] and adoption it's it's surely surely we
[16:13] can know church this morning that this
[16:14] adoption time it's time where all these
[16:18] things that brother random preached
[16:19] about all the Believers preached about
[16:21] down Through the Ages now it's coming up
[16:23] to a head where there's there's Saints
[16:25] on the earth now that believe fully what
[16:27] brother random taught
[16:29] believe fully what Christ taught all
[16:31] these things that have been laid down
[16:32] Through the Ages and brother Ram said
[16:35] when Joshua divided the inheritance to
[16:37] the people each person was placed
[16:39] positionally exactly the way these
[16:41] Hebrew mothers named those children
[16:44] exactly the way that when they were
[16:47] their mama was crying out when they were
[16:48] born when they were born crying out
[16:51] where are you going to be placed when
[16:53] they come up where they were in the
[16:55] promised land they were placed exactly
[16:57] according to that prophecy y he said the
[16:59] Church of God begin to get in its place
[17:02] that's then's when the Philistines will
[17:03] go to back and up the shorts will go off
[17:06] hair will grow down faces will be washed
[17:08] cigars will be missing why why now cuz
[17:11] what it is it's the church beginning to
[17:12] get in place the word claiming your life
[17:15] and bringing you under subjection to
[17:17] what God to what God Said positionally
[17:20] placing the church where it absolutely
[17:21] stands in Christ now there's there's our
[17:25] inheritance this morning so when you
[17:26] hear the gospel trumpet say saying that
[17:28] you can return back to your what are we
[17:30] returning back to we're returning back
[17:32] to the original Faith the original Power
[17:34] and demonstration of the Holy Ghost the
[17:36] Holy Ghost loosed in the church that's
[17:38] what the word the purpose of the word
[17:40] was for when you hear the word it it
[17:41] provides an Avenue for the Holy Ghost to
[17:43] be loosed in your life the word the word
[17:46] being being preached is not supposed to
[17:48] Bar the Holy Ghost but it's supposed to
[17:50] loose it because that's what you're
[17:52] inheritance is the Hol the your
[17:54] inheritance is the life of God and the
[17:56] church the life of God and the believer
[17:58] and brother R would say if somehow or
[18:00] other The Inheritance and the individual
[18:02] lost their inheritance that was given to
[18:04] them by God there come a year called The
[18:06] Jubilee year if he was a Freeborn and a
[18:09] true blooded Israelite no matter who
[18:11] held the possession it had it had to go
[18:14] back to him free he didn't have to pay a
[18:16] thing he didn't have to pay he didn't
[18:18] have to do a thing but just stop what he
[18:21] was doing and go back to his inheritance
[18:24] oh if we could just really think about
[18:25] this morning that you don't have to do a
[18:27] thing it's not by worse it's just by
[18:29] faith in what Christ has already done
[18:31] we're not saved by by working it up or
[18:34] or or trying to do something trying to
[18:36] do anything but it's it's all on him
[18:38] that Christ paid the price for us Christ
[18:41] is the one that that did everything for
[18:43] us and we've got a right to return back
[18:46] to our inheritance brother R said he had
[18:49] a right to it it was a god-given right
[18:51] because he by Grace had inherited it and
[18:53] it would have been given to his fathers
[18:55] and handed down year after year no no
[18:58] matter what had taken place if he lost
[19:00] it it must go free it meant Grace is is
[19:04] Grace is a way provided for each
[19:06] individual to return to their rightful
[19:09] inheritance oh this morning if we could
[19:11] understand our rights that God we've got
[19:13] a right to return back to what God
[19:15] promised John in John chapter 10 it says
[19:18] the thief cometh not but to for to steal
[19:20] and to kill and to destroy he said I am
[19:23] come that they might have life and that
[19:24] they might have it more abundantly
[19:26] because that's your inheritance this
[19:27] morning that the devil wants to take it
[19:29] away from me and say you can't have
[19:31] access to it but Jesus says you can have
[19:34] access to it oh we've got that promise
[19:36] in act chapter 2 238 that the promise is
[19:38] unto you and to your children whoever
[19:40] wants the Holy Ghost whoever wants more
[19:42] of God you got a promise laying there in
[19:44] the Bible oh thank God that we've got a
[19:47] father that will back up his promises
[19:49] thank God we've got a God that will keep
[19:50] his promises and if God promised it then
[19:53] you can just Bank everything on it
[19:55] because God is going to back up his word
[19:58] and he promised he promised that it's
[20:00] your right youve got a right to claim
[20:02] any if God promised you got a right to
[20:05] say I I can have access to that Joshua
[20:08] 1:9 he said have not I commanded thee be
[20:11] strong and of a good courage Be not
[20:13] Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the
[20:15] Lord thy God is with thee withs soever
[20:18] thou goest oh if we could to have
[20:19] confidence like that to know that the
[20:21] same like Joshua said that I know that
[20:23] the same God that was with with mooses
[20:26] Moses is going to be with me we got to
[20:28] have the same confidence to know that
[20:30] the same God that was with William
[20:32] brandham is with
[20:35] us oh that'll give us confidence in this
[20:38] hour and Joshua chapter 21 he said there
[20:40] fail not all of any good thing which the
[20:42] Lord had spoken unto the house of Israel
[20:44] all came to pass and we can have that
[20:47] kind of confidence looking into the word
[20:48] that if God spoke it he's going to bring
[20:50] it to pass and Ephesians chapter 2 he
[20:53] said for we are his workmanship created
[20:55] in Christ Jesus under good works which
[20:57] God hath before ordained that we should
[20:59] walk in them that that's our that's our
[21:02] right that God is fashioning us up what
[21:04] is your to to be like him to walk like
[21:07] him to be able to to think like him in
[21:09] Romans 8:29 he says you are
[21:11] predestinated to be conformed to the
[21:13] image of the Su Son of God that's that's
[21:15] what God wants you to be to to be like
[21:18] Jesus that's what your inheritance is
[21:20] Christ made a way this morning that
[21:22] every fiber of your being could be
[21:24] filled up with him because that's that's
[21:26] what God wanted you to be your
[21:27] inheritance is in Christ and the message
[21:30] all the days of our life brother BR said
[21:32] now we hear so much about it we are free
[21:35] oh we live in a beautiful America we are
[21:37] free all the air is full of it books are
[21:40] wrote of it thousands of them but you
[21:42] are a million miles from being free oh
[21:45] to think of that this morning that so
[21:46] many people in America think they're
[21:48] free and they're living in bondage maybe
[21:51] this morning some of some of us sit
[21:52] standing here this uh sitting in here
[21:54] this morning think we're
[21:56] free oh to be
[21:59] free that's what the gospel is for to
[22:01] give us Liberty from the bondage of the
[22:03] devil he said you're a million miles
[22:06] from being free you're not free don't
[22:07] you be deceived by that America is one
[22:09] of the greatest deceived Nations and in
[22:12] more bondage than any place that I know
[22:14] of they're worse and bondage than
[22:16] communism can put them in com communism
[22:19] come communism can only hurt the body
[22:22] they can only put the body in bondage
[22:24] but when the Devil comes in he puts the
[22:26] soul in bondage and man is a slave
[22:30] America is a bunch of slaves you might
[22:32] be a slave to
[22:35] Pride that's PR you might walk up and
[22:38] down the streets and go through every
[22:39] store and every fashion that you can see
[22:41] on television and go from store to store
[22:44] trying to buy something you become a
[22:46] slave to it you become a slave to your
[22:48] dressing you become a slave to your
[22:50] money that's the only thing that you can
[22:53] think of is money grab and put it here
[22:55] if you do that you're a Slave oh think
[22:58] this morning what are you a slave to if
[23:00] you're a slave to clothes if you're a
[23:01] slave to Hollywood to Fashion of this
[23:04] world that's what the gospel message was
[23:06] to to to to tell you that you don't have
[23:08] to be a prisoner to those things anymore
[23:10] and the devil will convince you that
[23:11] you're happy when you're you got to
[23:13] drink that alcohol and smoke that
[23:15] cigarette and do all those things but
[23:18] like just like the Israelites laboring
[23:20] down in Egypt making bricks without
[23:22] straw the devil telling them go when I
[23:24] say and come when I say and arise when I
[23:26] say and the Taskmaster whipping them and
[23:29] tell them to go back and forth that's
[23:30] exactly what that this fix that the
[23:32] devil will get get so many people today
[23:34] the devil will tell everyone around tell
[23:36] you tell you that you're happy that
[23:38] you're in prison that God don't even
[23:39] love you anymore until you're you're
[23:42] glad that you're in the prison
[23:44] house but this morning there is a way
[23:48] out of servitude to sin it now you know
[23:51] you know this morning think about what
[23:53] the devil does to people he'll put he'll
[23:54] put those thoughts in their mind that
[23:56] this is just the way it is
[23:58] and and it begin begin to make you feel
[24:01] like so dejected and down and feel like
[24:03] you just can't get out of the situation
[24:05] you're in and you start thinking that I
[24:06] can't break free I just can't break free
[24:08] of consuming things that I shouldn't I
[24:11] just can't break free of looking things
[24:12] that that I shouldn't but if you'll just
[24:14] look at Jesus Jesus is the one that
[24:17] already paid the price or you think
[24:19] about that when they were in uh coming
[24:22] out of Egypt and they started getting
[24:24] bit by snakes and many of them started
[24:26] dying and and God told Moses to just
[24:28] take a brass Serpent and put it on a
[24:30] pole and lift it up and if you just look
[24:32] at that brass serpent that you'd be
[24:33] delivered now that it it seems until you
[24:36] really apply it until you really take
[24:38] the gospel message it it it it doesn't
[24:40] seem like something maybe that would
[24:42] take effect but try it sometime try I
[24:45] tell you if you if you really change
[24:47] your diet and start eating the word you
[24:50] cannot stay the same you you start
[24:53] eating the word and start gobbling up
[24:54] the word you there's no way that your
[24:57] life will stay the the same you look to
[24:59] what Jesus did and start putting your
[25:01] faith in what go what God Said and begin
[25:03] to just meditate on the promises that he
[25:05] made and there's no way that your life
[25:07] can be the same you start turning loose
[25:09] like we were preaching Wednesday night
[25:11] turning loose of Pride and turning loose
[25:13] start start looking at God and say I I
[25:15] I'm not I I don't want to be like this
[25:17] anymore I I I don't want I want you to
[25:19] take a hold of my life I want to be
[25:20] under under subjection to the word I
[25:22] want my life to be changed and something
[25:25] will begin to break free you start
[25:27] thinking I can't break free of thinking
[25:29] God doesn't love me look at the cross
[25:30] where Jesus blood where Jesus shed his
[25:33] blood for you start thinking I can't
[25:35] break free of doubt and worry look at
[25:37] the stripes where he bore that he bore
[25:39] for our SARS and for our in our
[25:41] iniquities oh that that's the Trap Of
[25:44] The Devil to make you get all doubtful
[25:46] and worried and fearful and everything
[25:48] but just look at
[25:49] Jesus cuz the gospel message is to bring
[25:52] Liberty to you that's what the gospel
[25:54] the gospel is for somebody that's not in
[25:56] their right mind so that's what the
[25:58] gospel was sent to do to deliver you
[26:00] from the prison house to give you a
[26:02] purpose and what what is your purpose to
[26:04] know that you have an inheritance to
[26:06] come to your inheritance to claim that
[26:08] inheritance that is what God's purpose
[26:10] is for you to be delivered from the
[26:12] world for you to have a sound mind for
[26:13] you to have healing in your body for you
[26:15] to have peace in the time of trouble
[26:18] that's what I believe I believe that
[26:19] this is a positive message that we
[26:21] preach this morning we've got a positive
[26:24] gospel a gospel that in the when you're
[26:26] down in the valley down in the dump said
[26:28] we've got a gospel to pull you out and
[26:30] lift you
[26:32] up 1 Peter chapter 3 chapter 1:3 says
[26:37] blessed be the God and father of our
[26:38] Lord Jesus Christ which according to His
[26:40] abundant Mercy hath begotten us again
[26:43] unto a lively hope we've got a lively
[26:45] hope this
[26:47] morning by the resurrection of Jesus
[26:50] Christ from the dead to an inheritance
[26:53] what kind of inheritance Incorruptible
[26:57] and un UND defiled and that fadeth not
[27:00] away thank God for for an inheritance
[27:03] this morning that is Incorruptible that
[27:06] when you get under subjection to that
[27:07] word you can live according to the word
[27:10] I thank God for a holy a gospel that'll
[27:12] make us a holy give us a holy life
[27:15] undefiled and that fadeth not
[27:18] away this is a gospel that'll make us
[27:21] make us live like Jesus and it says
[27:23] reserved in heaven for you but what does
[27:26] God God wants somebody that will face
[27:28] face the devil that will that will look
[27:30] at the devil square in the face and say
[27:31] I've got a God that made a promise he
[27:33] wants somebody to do like Caleb and'll
[27:35] take up that sword and go after him and
[27:37] we'll face the Giants and the Jubilee
[27:40] Year brother Brown said men and women in
[27:42] our country and everywhere else has sold
[27:43] their out to sin drinking gambling
[27:46] carousing doing things that they ought
[27:48] not to do and become slaves to the devil
[27:51] he said I met a young lady here not long
[27:53] ago she said brother bradam I'd give
[27:55] anything if I could only break this this
[27:57] band of whiskey she said I started when
[27:59] I was a little girl went with a boy that
[28:01] drank we started mixing drinks and I
[28:02] become a perfect slave to it if I don't
[28:05] have it she says i' just go wild if I
[28:07] could only get rid of this I said you
[28:08] can't do it yourself but I know someone
[28:11] who could break it for you the Lord
[28:13] Jesus Christ has come to make you free I
[28:16] I'm thinking this morning of so many
[28:18] testimonies that I've heard over years
[28:19] I'm thinking of
[28:21] some a man that told me years ago that
[28:23] he was smoking cigarettes and one day he
[28:26] just kept laying it before the Lord and
[28:28] one day the Lord just took it from him
[28:30] think about all these examples of people
[28:31] that battled things out and tried to do
[28:33] it theirself and then they just laid it
[28:35] before the Lord and the Lord just took
[28:36] it
[28:38] away that's why in the message to
[28:40] Paradox he he would brother R explain
[28:42] that that you you are a miracle so many
[28:44] times we're looking for miracles when
[28:46] it's happening right in front of our
[28:47] eyes right in our own
[28:50] lives that God can take somebody that's
[28:53] that's that's just on the on the in the
[28:55] in the ditch on the side of the road
[28:57] covered in mud and pull them out and
[29:00] place them in church and change up their
[29:01] life and clean them up that oh that's
[29:04] that's what real justification and
[29:05] sanctification is in PR practice that
[29:08] God can take that mury muddy drinking
[29:10] vessel out of the ditch and pick them up
[29:12] and clean them out and wash them off and
[29:14] put them in church and fill them with
[29:15] the Holy Ghost and now they got a change
[29:17] life that's what your inheritance is
[29:19] this morning this church oh this morning
[29:22] if if you don't realize what God wants
[29:24] you to have access to God don't want you
[29:26] to live under the bondage of the devil
[29:28] and where the devil's just tap dancing
[29:30] on your head and dropping all this kind
[29:33] of stuff all over you well you can't
[29:36] live right and do right and can't think
[29:38] right and walk right God wants you to
[29:40] live an overcoming
[29:42] life thinking about the Egyptians in
[29:45] bondage Moses tried to deliver Israel
[29:47] with his own strength and now how many
[29:48] so many times we try to do it with our
[29:50] own strength Moses got up and he Saidi
[29:53] just going to deliver the is Israelites
[29:55] with without meeting God first and he
[29:57] and he ended up being a murderer because
[29:59] of
[30:00] it you you might think be thinking this
[30:02] morning well I just don't understand why
[30:04] it don't work you know so many people
[30:07] they'll go to the doctor and the doctor
[30:08] will prescribe them some medicine and
[30:10] they'll go go home and they won't take
[30:11] the medicine and then maybe wonder why
[30:14] it didn't work why why am I still
[30:15] feeling pain in my hip when the doctor
[30:17] gave me some pain medicine well you got
[30:19] to take the medicine you got to do what
[30:21] the doctor said and you got to do what
[30:23] Dr Jesus said if you take the medicine
[30:26] that then the medicine will have an
[30:27] effect and there's so many people around
[30:29] the world today saying well the medicine
[30:31] don't have any won't have any effect
[30:32] because they look at how other people
[30:34] are living they look at how the uh
[30:36] gospel is being preached in different C
[30:38] circumstances listen I can't tell I
[30:40] can't help how some people preach the
[30:42] message I can't tell how helps how some
[30:44] people live I can't help all those
[30:46] things I can't help the people that
[30:48] didn't do what the doctor said I can't
[30:50] help the people that didn't take the
[30:52] gospel the way that it was prescribed
[30:54] but I know one thing that if you'll take
[30:56] this gos peel the way that Jesus
[30:57] prescribed that it'll do what he
[30:59] said if you take the peel the way the
[31:02] book said it'll work and and how will it
[31:06] work you take it the way that the doctor
[31:07] prescribed and it'll it'll heal you
[31:10] it'll heal you because he promised it
[31:11] would you take it the way the doctor
[31:13] prescribed and it'll change you cuz I
[31:15] know I know person it it'll change it'll
[31:17] change your thinking it'll change the
[31:19] way that you walk and the way that you
[31:20] live and the way that you who do you
[31:22] associate with and I've seen the effect
[31:24] that it's had in others and I I know
[31:26] that it'll do what it's what God said
[31:28] it'll do so if you say if you're saying
[31:31] this morning what I don't understand why
[31:33] it don't work oh you can try to prop get
[31:35] yourself you can try to get yourself out
[31:37] like painting a falling down house you
[31:39] can just keep painting a falling down
[31:41] house but that house is going to keep
[31:42] falling down or propping up blocks every
[31:45] time they fall you can try to keep just
[31:46] keep propping it up oh but if you do
[31:49] like Moses did and get that burning bush
[31:51] experience On The Backs side of the
[31:53] desert and get a real relationship with
[31:55] God oh Moses when he got in front of
[31:57] that bur and burning bush and heard that
[31:58] voice say take off your shoes for your
[32:00] on Holy Ground he realized something was
[32:03] different than than what his his mama
[32:06] had told he had heard from his mama all
[32:08] those years and walked and walked and
[32:09] tried to make it work but one day when
[32:12] he got in front of a living God and
[32:14] everything changed you get in front of a
[32:16] living God one time and find out you'll
[32:18] find out what's right and wrong you'll
[32:20] find out that that this gospel message
[32:23] really does work in Romans chap 3: 19 it
[32:27] says now we know that what things soever
[32:29] the law saith it saith to them who are
[32:31] under the law that every mouth may be
[32:33] stopped and all the world may become
[32:35] guilty before God therefore by the Deeds
[32:38] of the law there shall no flesh be
[32:40] justified in his sight for by the law is
[32:43] the knowledge of sin what what's that
[32:45] talking about you need God you need the
[32:47] grace of God in your life you could try
[32:49] to work it up and try to meet all the
[32:51] requirements of God and yourself but it
[32:53] takes God working in your life to bring
[32:56] you out of
[32:58] bondage and I thank God that's God
[33:01] that's what the gospel is for to show us
[33:02] his Grace Grace that God has given a
[33:05] Grace that God would come and die on the
[33:07] cross for us and shed his life for us so
[33:09] that God would get put his life in the
[33:11] heart of a believer that he would live
[33:13] it inside of you in John 8:34 it says
[33:17] Jesus answered them verily verily I say
[33:19] unto you whosoever committeth sin as the
[33:21] servant of sin and the servant abideth
[33:24] not in the house forever but the son
[33:26] abideth abideth ever if the son
[33:29] therefore shall make you free ye shall
[33:30] be free
[33:32] indeed and brother bam would say he said
[33:34] the church now is like Israel God by His
[33:37] Marvelous Grace without any organization
[33:40] or anything else he called Israel to his
[33:42] health he called them to their
[33:44] inheritance and Grace furnished them a
[33:47] prophet Grace gave them a pillar of fire
[33:51] Grace gave him a lamb sacrificial lamb
[33:54] Grace give them power Grace Grace give
[33:57] them Deliverance Grace give them Victory
[34:01] Grace give them all these things and he
[34:05] said they danced in the spirit and
[34:06] shouted and praised God about it oh to
[34:09] think this morning that we were in
[34:10] bondage we were in bondage in a
[34:12] denominational system and Grace gave us
[34:15] a prophet and Grace gave us a pillar of
[34:17] fire and Grace gave us the power of God
[34:20] restored back in our lives again Grace
[34:23] gave them a lamb sacrificial lamb Grace
[34:25] did give them power Grace it's Grace to
[34:28] be a son and not a servant it's Grace
[34:31] not to be bound by all these things that
[34:33] the devil wants us to be bound Grace
[34:36] that you don't have to be a
[34:38] servant maybe this morning you're
[34:40] sitting here and you're thinking about
[34:41] these things and you're still in bondage
[34:44] but you don't have to be a servant
[34:45] anymore God's given us Grace to be a
[34:49] son and exodus 21 verse1 it says now
[34:53] these are the judgments which Thou shalt
[34:55] set before them if thou B and Hebrew
[34:57] servant six years He Shall Serve and in
[35:00] the seventh he shall go out free for
[35:03] nothing to think this morning that you
[35:05] can be free for nothing that you can be
[35:08] free and you don't have to pay anything
[35:10] you don't have to do anything all you
[35:12] got to do is just look to
[35:17] Jesus I think now a man would lose his
[35:20] inheritance that he could not buy back
[35:22] himself and he'd find himself working in
[35:24] service servitude to a Master until that
[35:27] debt was paid off helpless under the
[35:30] power of his master whipped and beaten
[35:33] but every seven years a message go out
[35:35] that he could go free for
[35:37] nothing every seven years there was a
[35:39] set time that he could go free oh to
[35:42] think now looking down through the seven
[35:44] Church ages every every every age
[35:47] there's been a time where people could
[35:48] go free if they would just hear that
[35:50] gospel
[35:51] call in Genesis chapter 17 it says my
[35:54] Covenant will I establish with Isaac
[35:55] which Sarah shall bear and to thee at
[35:57] this set time in the next year talking
[35:59] about a set time there's always a set
[36:01] time and there's a set time that you can
[36:03] go free in first Samuel Samuel chapter
[36:05] 13 and he carried seven days according
[36:08] to the set time that Samuel had
[36:10] appointed but Samuel came not to gilgal
[36:12] and the people were scattered from him
[36:14] there's a set time all through the
[36:15] scripture and there was a set time when
[36:17] the people could go free and be
[36:18] delivered and you could get a oh that
[36:21] set time the mystery of the Seven Stars
[36:23] in Revelation chapter 1 which thou
[36:25] sawest in my right hand there was a set
[36:27] time every every church every time a
[36:29] church age a church age messenger would
[36:31] come forth and preach it was the time
[36:33] for the people to go free if they would
[36:35] hear that message that was delivered and
[36:37] you don't you can go out of the pawn
[36:39] shop for free it's time to go out you
[36:41] don't have to pay the minister you can
[36:43] go out for free you don't have to thank
[36:45] anybody you don't have to give a speech
[36:47] you don't have to be a preacher you
[36:48] don't have to make a donation you don't
[36:51] have to be a big shot you don't have to
[36:53] know a lot all you've got to do is look
[36:55] to Jesus I I think this morning that
[36:58] that's the best deal in 2,000
[37:00] [Applause]
[37:03] years oh we've got a message to preach
[37:06] this morning that's we've got a message
[37:08] of Grace that you've got a right you've
[37:10] got a right to not be in bondage anymore
[37:12] I I I believe that this is the hour
[37:14] again of Jubilee brother R would say
[37:16] it's the time of Jubilee what is it the
[37:18] Jubilee is the time the time of deliver
[37:21] the time of restoration where you've got
[37:22] a right to have the holy ghost power in
[37:25] your life and brother would say uh that
[37:27] little person down in servitude he said
[37:30] he didn't have to pay a thing he didn't
[37:31] have to do a thing but just stop what he
[37:33] was doing and go back to his inheritance
[37:36] he had a right to it it was a god-given
[37:38] right because he by Grace had inherited
[37:42] it no matter what had taken place if he
[37:44] lost it it must go free it meant Grace
[37:47] is a way provided for each individual to
[37:50] return to their rightful inheritance oh
[37:53] we've got a right to get back to the
[37:54] power of God we've got a right to get
[37:56] back to the original anointing that they
[37:58] had in the early church age brother R
[38:00] would say he said we'd have it we've got
[38:01] it too easy we get slothful we get to a
[38:05] place where we don't want why why do we
[38:06] get why do we get slothful I wonder oh
[38:09] Caleb when they said when they when they
[38:11] told him what that you got to right to
[38:13] that mountain he didn't just sit there
[38:15] and maybe prop his feet up in his in his
[38:17] recliner and say
[38:19] well it's mine I'm just going to look at
[38:22] it no he grabbed his sword and he went
[38:25] after it oh that's that's what we got to
[38:28] do is is go after what God Said we've
[38:30] got a right to and not be slothful he
[38:33] said we get to a place where we don't
[38:34] want to move on because everything is
[38:36] just handed to us it takes sorrow and
[38:39] tears and sweat and prayer and faith and
[38:42] promise to move forward in the power of
[38:44] the holy spirit that Zeal and power that
[38:46] they had in those days has long time
[38:48] vanished from our assemblies I was I was
[38:51] telling somebody recently over over over
[38:53] food while while we were eating together
[38:55] that I think the worst thing that can
[38:57] happen to a group of Believers is where
[38:58] they just begin to lose their Zeal and
[39:00] just begin to not care anymore oh Caleb
[39:03] cared about that mountain he was think
[39:05] about he was an old man by the time they
[39:07] got to the promised land but when they
[39:08] told him that this is your you got a
[39:10] right to this inheritance he was going
[39:12] to go after that no matter if there was
[39:14] Giants on that land he was going to go
[39:16] after it he said that that Zeal and
[39:19] power that they had in those days has
[39:21] long time vanished from our assemblies
[39:24] he said I'm afraid if the windows would
[39:26] be shut out tonight people would run
[39:28] every way and never come back again cuz
[39:30] he's talking about a church where the
[39:31] windows got shot out and the people were
[39:33] praising God and the bullets didn't hit
[39:35] nobody cuz they had such a Zeal they
[39:37] they they were so on fire for God the
[39:39] Holy Ghost anointing was in that place
[39:42] oh this morning I wonder do you hear the
[39:44] sound of Freedom if you're if you're in
[39:45] bondage that that sound of freedom is
[39:47] still calling what is it it's the gospel
[39:49] Trump telling you that you don't have to
[39:51] be in bondage to the devil anymore
[39:54] because in Isaiah chap 53 he said sure
[39:56] surely he hath borne our griefs and
[39:58] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[40:00] him strick and smitten of God and
[40:02] Afflicted he was wounded for our
[40:04] transgressions he was bruised for our
[40:06] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[40:09] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[40:12] healed we've got confidence in these
[40:13] promises that are laid out for us this
[40:15] morning that if he promised it that's
[40:19] that's something that'll give us
[40:20] strength and encouragement in the hour
[40:22] of
[40:23] need or when you've heard that gospel
[40:25] trumpet it'll cause will cause an effect
[40:27] to happen in your life if you really
[40:29] open up your heart and let it be sewn in
[40:31] the good ground of your heart it's going
[40:33] to have an effect in you what it'll do
[40:35] it it'll make you repent it'll make you
[40:37] it'll cause you to be stirred it'll
[40:39] cause you to be stirred up it'll cause
[40:42] you to hunger it'll cause you to cry out
[40:45] it'll cause you to come to church it'll
[40:48] cause you to open up your Bible you'll
[40:51] listen to the message yes that's what
[40:53] that gospel Trump does why cuz it had
[40:56] that same effect to that little servant
[40:58] Bound in Bound in slavery down there in
[41:01] in the promised land when they'd get
[41:03] into a spot where they couldn't pay
[41:05] their bills and they'd have to sell
[41:06] theirself to another Israelite and for
[41:09] seven years but then when they heard
[41:11] that gospel Trump sound oh they didn't
[41:13] just sit there but they they dropped
[41:15] that hoe and they they knew that they
[41:17] could be free brother Ram said in the
[41:19] Jubilee year the message Jubilee year he
[41:21] said I remember myself when I heard that
[41:23] good news come to my heart as a little
[41:25] old sinner boy laying in on the hospital
[41:27] bed the doctor says you got three more
[41:29] minutes to live I heard a sound from
[41:32] Heaven that told me Jubilee year was on
[41:35] I I wonder this morning if you could
[41:36] look back and remember when you first
[41:37] heard that
[41:39] sound that the Jubilee year was on he
[41:42] said I accepted the Lord Jesus turned
[41:44] loose all the shackles of sin and said
[41:47] to the devil you can't do me any more
[41:49] harm because I have given my life to
[41:51] Christ Jesus and you can't whip me
[41:54] anymore since then he's bluffed me lots
[41:57] of times but he's not been able to touch
[41:59] me since because he's just a bluff I can
[42:02] hear his whip cracking and popping and
[42:04] so forth but it don't do no good because
[42:06] he can't get me because I belong to the
[42:08] Lord now that's right oh to think about
[42:12] this morning that when you hear that
[42:13] gospel trumpet you can throw that back
[42:15] in the devil's face and say I got a
[42:17] right I got a right to what my daddy
[42:19] said I got a right I got a right to the
[42:21] New Birth if you're seeking the new
[42:22] birth this morning you've got a right to
[42:24] it if you're seeking adoption this
[42:26] morning you've got a right to it why why
[42:29] cuz my daddy promised
[42:30] it servants have their reward servants
[42:33] have their reward but you are sons and
[42:36] Galatians chapter 4 it says because you
[42:38] are Sons God ha sent forth the spirit of
[42:40] his son and your hearts crying ABA
[42:43] father wherefore Thou Art no more a
[42:45] servant you're ain't a servant no more
[42:47] but a son and if a son then an heir of
[42:50] God through Christ oh to think this
[42:52] morning that if you're a son not a
[42:54] servant then that makes you entitled to
[42:56] everything that God has access
[42:58] everything that he own if he owns the
[43:00] cattle on a thousand hills then that
[43:02] means you got a right to it cuz you're
[43:04] his son he's your daddy oh what a
[43:07] privilege it is by the new birth to be
[43:08] able to know who your daddy is to be
[43:11] able to be identified with him when we
[43:13] can look into the Bible and be
[43:15] identified with all these Scriptures it
[43:17] proves who we are it shows us who we are
[43:20] like Josiah when he could look back and
[43:21] read in First Kings chapter 13 that was
[43:24] written 350 years before he was born and
[43:27] see how it was written of him that he
[43:29] would be a king one day and you and I
[43:31] can look into the Bible and see and read
[43:33] that God wanted us to be adopt adopted
[43:36] that he wanted us to fulfill the things
[43:38] that were written of us in this
[43:40] hour oh that we've been resurrected from
[43:43] dead Works to serve a living God not to
[43:45] be slaved to sin brother R will say now
[43:48] the he he Heathen slave could not return
[43:51] back to his inheritance he didn't know
[43:52] nothing about it he a heathen means an
[43:55] unbeliever an unbeliever in the word
[43:57] they don't know what you're talking
[43:58] about they want to call you a holy ruler
[44:01] they want to call you like they did
[44:02] their forefathers 50 years ago in
[44:04] Louisiana crazy like it was back in the
[44:07] days of Paul and the way of heresy
[44:09] that's the way I worship the god of our
[44:10] father see the Heathen don't know
[44:12] nothing about it oh oh to think this
[44:15] morning now if you want to know what it
[44:17] means to be a Son of God and what you've
[44:19] got access to then you got to be born a
[44:21] Son of God if you wanted if you wanted
[44:23] to know what it was like just speaking
[44:26] rhetoric brother Brown would even say
[44:27] that he said before I could act as a
[44:29] human before I could walk like a human
[44:32] before I could talk like a human I got
[44:33] to be born to
[44:35] human a a duck's born a duck a duck
[44:37] knows what it's like to be a duck a
[44:40] raccoon's born a raccoon it knows what
[44:41] it's like to be a raccoon a human you're
[44:44] born a human so you know what it's like
[44:45] to be born a human but you got to be
[44:48] born a Son of God to know what it's like
[44:50] to be a Son of God you got to be born to
[44:53] know what you to to know to realize what
[44:56] you have access to Hey brother said in
[44:58] order to be a Son of God you've got to
[45:00] be born of the spirit of God then you
[45:02] become Christlike and do the works of
[45:04] Christ then you're not funny to them
[45:06] people a human acting like a human is
[45:10] not funny oh when a Son of God acting
[45:13] like a Son of God is Not doesn't look
[45:15] off it doesn't look funny sitting here
[45:17] in church it won't look out of kilter if
[45:20] you're if you're really born of the
[45:22] spirit of God if you're really born and
[45:24] what is this gospel message that I'm
[45:26] preaching that you can have Liberty that
[45:28] that you can come out if you're if
[45:30] you're bound by change of sin that
[45:32] there's a way out that there's a way
[45:34] that you can come forth you can come
[45:36] forth through the Matrix and be born a
[45:38] new your life can be changed and your
[45:40] thinking can be changed the way that you
[45:43] are can be Chang I thank God for a
[45:45] gospel message that actually will
[45:46] correct the way that we were born
[45:49] naturally oh we come to this world with
[45:51] our old carnal mind with our carnal
[45:53] nature we come into the world the
[45:55] lusting after things that we shouldn't
[45:57] be and looking after things that we
[45:58] shouldn't listen I'm preaching the truth
[46:01] to you now this morning you come to the
[46:02] world wrong and now maybe this morning
[46:05] you might be called up looking at
[46:06] pornography and looking at things that
[46:08] you shouldn't be doing but there's a
[46:09] gospel that that if you let it grab a
[46:11] hold of your life it'll change you it'll
[46:14] change you where right now you might be
[46:16] in bondage to sin and bondage to shame
[46:18] of this world but let the gospel get a
[46:20] hold of you and it'll change it it'll
[46:22] correct it so that you don't act like
[46:24] that anymore right
[46:26] oh if you can just receive Liberty and
[46:28] no longer be bound by change of change
[46:31] of unbelief I got something that will
[46:33] take God at his word come what may
[46:36] that's what that's what this Liberty in
[46:37] Christ Jesus has given to us that we can
[46:39] believe God no matter what that can
[46:42] identify itself back with the word like
[46:44] Ruth oh you think about Ruth now Ruth
[46:47] did not even have an inheritance Ruth
[46:50] was a moabi what inheritance she did she
[46:52] have she didn't possess any inheritance
[46:54] but she was brought into an inheritance
[46:56] by the work of a redeemer and we've got
[46:58] a redeemer who can who brought us back
[47:00] to our inheritance she had a redeemer
[47:02] that she trusted in she had she put all
[47:04] of her confidence in and laid At His
[47:06] Feet until he throwed over her a type of
[47:09] the Holy Ghost His Garment oh church do
[47:12] you remember your own personal Jubilee
[47:14] do you remember when you come out of
[47:16] bondage now if you don't if you don't
[47:18] maybe you need one this morning and
[47:20] that's what I'm preaching this morning
[47:22] that there's an opportunity for you to
[47:23] have your own Jubilee where you can
[47:25] throw your hands in praise and worship
[47:28] and and Trust in a redeemer just like
[47:30] Ruth
[47:35] did y'all help me preach this
[47:39] morning you know sometimes sometimes you
[47:41] know you're preaching a sermon and it
[47:43] might not really be for for for you
[47:45] sitting there in the Pew but a real
[47:46] mature believer will recognize it it
[47:48] might be for that person sitting over
[47:50] sitting over next to them or somewhere
[47:51] else in the church and they won't draw
[47:53] up they won't pull back but they'll
[47:55] they'll say I I I whoever this is for I
[47:57] want it to go out I want it to help
[47:59] somebody and they'll start they'll
[48:01] they'll really start pulling pull pull
[48:03] now I I think I think we can be happy
[48:06] about the me happy about the gospel
[48:08] being preached even maybe if we're in a
[48:09] state this morning where maybe it
[48:11] doesn't particularly apply to your
[48:12] particular moment in your life maybe
[48:14] you're not in a season where it's going
[48:15] to help you as much as maybe it will
[48:16] somebody else but pull pull nevertheless
[48:20] because if it'll help somebody we're all
[48:22] trying to grow up to the
[48:24] Capstone
[48:27] [Applause]
[48:28] don't don't draw back when the gospel is
[48:30] preached I I I like it when I when I
[48:32] hear somebody preach something even if
[48:34] I've heard it a thousand times I I like
[48:36] it just the same it makes me happy to
[48:38] hear somebody preach something that I
[48:39] believe
[48:40] in now in the in the message the mark of
[48:43] the beast brother R said the trumpet was
[48:45] the trumpet and he sounded it and when
[48:46] he did every slave could go free back to
[48:49] his home if he was out in the field
[48:51] chopping with a hoe and somebody over
[48:53] here whipping him with a whip and he
[48:54] hear what was that what was that gospel
[48:57] trumpet sounding the good news throw
[48:59] that hole down and turn right around and
[49:02] say you have no more rule over me going
[49:06] home to my wife and kids I was sold over
[49:09] here in slavery oh to think now that's
[49:12] the effect that the gospel will have and
[49:15] it will have that effect where you can
[49:17] look around and say I I ain't in slate
[49:19] one day you can turn back around and say
[49:21] I know I ain't where I used to be
[49:23] Something's Happened to my life and
[49:26] oh can you remember church that time
[49:28] that you tossed that ho down and Rose up
[49:30] in Victory and and said oh the devil the
[49:32] devil don't have any more claim over my
[49:35] life he said you hear that trumpet sound
[49:37] and that means that I'm a Hebrew what
[49:39] does it mean when you hear that trumpet
[49:41] sound and you really recognize it you
[49:43] really recognize that gospel voice it
[49:47] identified you as a son it identifies
[49:51] who you are he said that mean when you
[49:53] hear it that means that I'm a Hebrew and
[49:55] in the Old Testament it means that I've
[49:57] got a right I am a Birthright in man I
[50:02] have a right I can go free without
[50:04] anybody's money not if you'll do this or
[50:07] you do that see the whole thing was
[50:09] Grace not if you will but if you'll hear
[50:13] the
[50:13] trumpet oh oh if you if you can hear it
[50:17] now and the Bible says that his sheep
[50:19] know his voice oh if you can recognize
[50:22] who that is calling you if you know who
[50:24] that is
[50:26] you realize this morning that hearing
[50:28] produces Freedom if you can hear it and
[50:31] you recognize it and it's not just like
[50:34] thundering brass a sounding symbol it's
[50:37] not just a bunch of noise to you but you
[50:39] really recognize that God is telling you
[50:42] you can go free then you can go
[50:46] free he said if you hear the trumpet see
[50:50] hearing Faith cometh by what hearing now
[50:53] not just listen with your ear
[50:56] but if you hear that means you
[50:58] understand it you accept it I hear you I
[51:01] believe it see it's hearing what is the
[51:04] gospel trumpet the good news the Holy
[51:08] Ghost is here how do you know it is
[51:12] watch it work see what it does yes sir
[51:15] it's the good news the good news is the
[51:18] Holy Ghost is here the whole the good
[51:21] news is you can have it you can have it
[51:23] if you're born again you can have more
[51:25] of it you can have as much as you can as
[51:28] much as you can hold this morning cuz
[51:30] God wants you to have so much until it
[51:32] just fills every fiber of you he said he
[51:35] could go free didn't have to pay nothing
[51:37] didn't have to do nothing just get up
[51:39] and go that's all he had to do go back
[51:42] if he knew the sound of the trumpet but
[51:44] he had to know the sound of the trumpet
[51:47] for they were sons of God oh to think
[51:50] about this this morning so many time so
[51:52] many times people sit in the church and
[51:53] they hear the message being preached
[51:55] they hear the word going over the pulpit
[51:57] but they just can't hear it and maybe it
[51:59] becomes something boring to them where
[52:00] they just they just they just don't see
[52:02] the value in it oh oh my to think that
[52:05] the devil can get somebody in such a
[52:07] pickle where they're they're happy with
[52:10] the situation that they're in they're
[52:11] happy with the life that they're living
[52:13] they're happy with their bondage they're
[52:15] they're fine with just playing video
[52:16] games 24 hours a day and and and and and
[52:20] just living a life that don't really
[52:22] have any meeting but God wants more for
[52:24] you than just that
[52:25] am oh if we can hear what the gospel is
[52:28] saying to us and you know brother R
[52:30] would lay it out he'd say so many time
[52:32] in the Old Testament they get in they
[52:34] get into a city they get where into a
[52:36] place now you see if you were out on the
[52:38] plane there were no walls and you could
[52:41] hear that gospel trumpet playing and you
[52:43] just youd drop your hoe and you knew you
[52:45] were free but if you were in a city
[52:47] within the wall then you couldn't hear
[52:49] that gospel trumpet and you couldn't go
[52:51] free in Leviticus 25:30 it it says and
[52:55] if it be not redeemed within the space
[52:57] of a full year then the house that is in
[52:58] the wall City shall be established
[53:00] forever to him that bought it throughout
[53:02] his Generations it shall not go out in
[53:03] the Jubilee so in other words if a man
[53:06] bought property inside of a wall City
[53:08] then he had one year to redeem that back
[53:10] if he sold it and if he did not redeem
[53:12] that back that property if it was inside
[53:14] of a wall it had to stay in there it
[53:16] couldn't go free your property if it was
[53:19] inside of a wall City it couldn't go
[53:21] free it was bound to stay there they
[53:23] were over the wall they never heard the
[53:25] Jubilee the trumpet sound and they
[53:27] sounded a trumpet and it could not go
[53:29] free now that's so many times what we'll
[53:32] do we we'll we'll allow ourselves to get
[53:34] walled off from other people and how do
[53:37] how do Walls Start walls you you get
[53:39] walled off by believing Your Den what
[53:41] your denomination says you your
[53:43] denomination says that they have a do
[53:46] Doctrine about the Trinity or whatever
[53:48] they say the baptism and you get walled
[53:51] off and you just can't hear that trumpet
[53:53] sounding that tells you that you you
[53:55] have a right to go free proclaiming what
[53:57] you have access to now now a lot of uh
[54:00] uh there's a lot of other ways you can
[54:01] get walled off too like you can get
[54:03] walled off just believing maybe like
[54:05] what your mama and daddy said Your Mama
[54:07] and Daddy might have some skewed views
[54:09] about about things like sometime I've
[54:11] heard years ago I heard somebody say
[54:13] well you just don't even need to pray
[54:14] anymore and see if you start adhering to
[54:16] what what people say you get walled off
[54:19] and won't be able to claim what God what
[54:22] God wants you to have access to oh but
[54:24] if you could come out from the wall I
[54:26] thank God this morning that we've got a
[54:27] kinsman redeemer that could go get us
[54:30] from within the wall City and bring us
[54:32] out and brother Mar would say some
[54:34] sometimes your kin oh that kinsman
[54:36] redeemer now he's put his life in you
[54:38] and that means now you've got Kinsmen
[54:40] that can go go to where you are all
[54:43] walled off and pull you out and tell you
[54:46] about the gospel tell you about he said
[54:49] he said a pilgrim out there in a bond
[54:51] sold out to the rich cities out there
[54:52] sold out into the riches of organization
[54:55] but a Kinsman brother who knows he's out
[54:57] there some night put his Bible under his
[54:59] arm go after him put his Bible under his
[55:03] arm and go into that wall oh you got all
[55:05] those walls around you separating
[55:07] yourself from other people pulling off
[55:09] to yourself he said a Kinsman because
[55:12] he's got the same Spirit he's born in
[55:14] the same family go call him out of that
[55:17] group thank God for a Kinsman who can go
[55:20] get you when you're walled off thank God
[55:23] for a Kinsman who come down and got us
[55:25] when we were walled off thank God for
[55:27] real brothers and sisters in Christ who
[55:28] can come and witness to us and tell us
[55:30] about the truth when we're walled off
[55:32] but I I think God this morning that
[55:33] we've gone beyond the camp we've gone
[55:36] Bey we've gone beyond the walls of
[55:38] organized religion we've gone beyond
[55:41] something that can just be argued about
[55:43] we've gone beyond those
[55:45] things brother R said we haven't walled
[55:48] ourselves away from it so far that we
[55:50] got to hear what somebody says instead
[55:52] of what thus sayith the Lord is I can
[55:54] hear what the word of God got to say
[55:56] about it now is the hour of Jubilee come
[56:00] back to your original inheritance to a
[56:02] real Holy Ghost again and he'd say it's
[56:05] time to rise be sons of God in the name
[56:07] of Jesus Christ and rise to a place so
[56:10] you can return in this Jubilee and hear
[56:12] the sound of the trumpet of the Gospel
[56:14] of the word of God what what is this
[56:17] Jubilee trumpet sounding that you've
[56:19] been anointed to B you you've not been
[56:21] anointed to bondage but to Liberty
[56:24] you've been you you been anointed to
[56:25] Liberty that you can go
[56:29] free oh I'm think about in the book of
[56:31] Acts what the Holy Ghost did for those
[56:33] Believers when when Paul and Silas were
[56:36] down in jail and the Holy Ghost they had
[56:38] those the prison bars all around them
[56:40] and and change all over them and but the
[56:44] Holy Ghost come and set them free the
[56:47] Bible says at midnight Paul S Paul and
[56:49] Silas prayed and sang Praises unto God
[56:51] and the prisoners heard them and
[56:53] immediately all the door doors were open
[56:55] and everyone's bands were
[56:58] loosed oh that's when you hear that
[57:00] gospel sound and you begin to recognize
[57:02] your Liberty oh watch something happen
[57:05] sometimes it takes a little praise to
[57:06] watch the chains fall off but you start
[57:08] you start praising God like Paul and
[57:10] Silas did and something begin to happen
[57:11] you start thanking him and watch the
[57:13] blessings come you start thanking God
[57:16] and watch something begin to
[57:18] happen thinking about Daniel down in
[57:20] Babylonian captivity when he he began to
[57:22] look at the what Jeremiah had prophesied
[57:25] that that they had an inheritance that
[57:27] they had a right to come out and it was
[57:28] about time the the time was right for
[57:31] them to come out it it was time for them
[57:33] to return and he began to look and oh
[57:36] that's what Daniel 70 weeks is about
[57:38] that it's time it was time for them to
[57:40] come out and it's time for us to come
[57:41] out and then moving on into the the uh
[57:45] the restoration of Israel in that in
[57:47] that last seven
[57:49] weeks uh God the the the message is
[57:53] about Liberty when when Jesus pulled up
[57:56] in that Scroll of Isaiah there in the
[57:57] temple and began to read from Isaiah and
[57:59] identified him with that scripture he
[58:01] was reading that the spirit of the Lord
[58:03] God is upon me because the Lord hath
[58:05] anointed me to preach Good Tidings under
[58:07] the meek he sent me to bind up the
[58:09] Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the
[58:11] captives and in other words he was
[58:13] identifying the Jubilee coming out
[58:15] Liberty to the captives he was
[58:17] identifying the Jubilee with preaching
[58:20] cuz that's what the Jubilee trumpet is
[58:21] the preaching of the Gospel oh you hear
[58:24] the preacher the good news of the Gospel
[58:26] like Daniel I believe we're going back
[58:28] we're going back to what God to the
[58:30] original faith brother R would say let's
[58:32] go back to god let's go back to the eego
[58:34] food let's go back to the leadership of
[58:36] the Holy Spirit let's go back to the
[58:38] word of God let's go back to the fast
[58:41] and pray back to the original back to
[58:43] what God wants wants us to have access
[58:48] to and then in
[58:51] Ephesians oh in Leviticus and I'll be
[58:54] closing here in just a
[58:55] minute in Le Leviticus 25:8 it says Thou
[58:59] shalt number seven sabbaths of years un
[59:01] thee see every every seven years that
[59:04] could go free but not all if you got
[59:06] married to a wife during that seven
[59:08] years you couldn't take her with you
[59:09] there was some things that had to stay
[59:12] back but every 50 years the whole thing
[59:16] could go
[59:17] free and verse eight it says Thou shalt
[59:19] number seven sabbaths of years under the
[59:21] seven seven times seven years in the
[59:23] space of the seven Sab of years shall be
[59:25] unto thee 40 and9 years then shalt thou
[59:28] cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to
[59:30] sound on the 10th day of the seventh
[59:32] month and the day of atonement shall you
[59:34] make the trumpet sound throughout all
[59:36] your land and ye shall H the 50th year
[59:39] and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the
[59:41] land unto all the inhabitants thereof it
[59:44] shall be a jubilee unto you and ye shall
[59:47] return every man unto his possession and
[59:49] ye shall return every man unto his
[59:52] family I want to thank this this morning
[59:55] that there's a reason why God had to
[59:57] send a prophet so that we could have
[59:59] full
[1:00:00] liberty down through the seven Church
[1:00:02] Ages Every like just typing that every
[1:00:04] seven years they could go free they
[1:00:06] could go free in their soul oh but here
[1:00:08] in this final age God has given us a way
[1:00:11] that we can go have complete Liberty in
[1:00:13] our soul and our spirit and our body
[1:00:16] that our body could be changed and you
[1:00:18] know to think now that the only
[1:00:19] requirement for Liberty is you got to
[1:00:21] hear that trumpet now now when they were
[1:00:23] when they when they heard that trumpet
[1:00:25] blast they they might not have been able
[1:00:27] to see the person blowing the trumpet as
[1:00:30] long as they heard it now now see
[1:00:32] there's many of us sitting here this
[1:00:34] morning that you know we didn't get to
[1:00:35] fish with brother brandom we didn't get
[1:00:37] to be in his meetings but we heard it
[1:00:39] just the same and see that's the only
[1:00:41] requirement that you hear that trumpet
[1:00:44] and and and we heard that trumpet blast
[1:00:46] that signifies that that we've got a
[1:00:48] right not just to be born again in our
[1:00:50] soul and we've got a right not to just
[1:00:53] be uh cleaned up in our spirit but we've
[1:00:57] got a right to a body change we've got a
[1:00:59] right to the
[1:01:00] Mysteries and and brother we we'll say
[1:01:03] we'll say it like that many of us here
[1:01:05] tonight have escaped the bondage of the
[1:01:06] world our souls have been sealed in but
[1:01:09] but in our spirit and our spirit and our
[1:01:11] body we just can't quite grasp the
[1:01:14] things that God wants us to have faith
[1:01:16] in we still it's what it is it's a
[1:01:18] disease of the spirit that even though
[1:01:21] you're born again of the soul that your
[1:01:23] spirit is still the SE then you think
[1:01:26] you you start you it's those mind
[1:01:27] battles you think I'm not I don't think
[1:01:29] I'm good enough I I wonder if I'm really
[1:01:32] born again like sister Shepherd laying
[1:01:34] there on on her couch and she had that
[1:01:35] dream and where she was wondering if she
[1:01:38] really was born again and she woke up
[1:01:40] and brother BR she told that dream to
[1:01:41] brother BR brandham and he preached the
[1:01:43] message a stat the stature of a perfect
[1:01:45] man why she needed an answer to that
[1:01:49] that's why God had to send a prophet to
[1:01:51] give us an answer to these things why so
[1:01:53] you would have confidence that you're
[1:01:56] born
[1:01:58] again so that you'd have something to
[1:02:00] throw back in the devil's face when the
[1:02:02] Devil Comes you with all these mind
[1:02:04] battles oh you see that's what God
[1:02:06] that's what that's what your right is
[1:02:08] your right is to know where you stand in
[1:02:11] Christ oh that the Mind battles in the
[1:02:14] spirit the disease of the spirit where
[1:02:15] you think I I don't know if I can take a
[1:02:17] body change oh that's CU your faith
[1:02:19] hadn't quite been built up to where it
[1:02:21] needs to be but God by the word he gave
[1:02:23] us a go to build up our faith to where
[1:02:26] you will know that you can take a body
[1:02:29] change you'll say maybe I don't know if
[1:02:32] faith will move a mountain for me for me
[1:02:36] there's the kicker I don't know if it
[1:02:37] will move a mountain for me oh but you
[1:02:40] got to know that faith will move a
[1:02:42] mountain from me if I've got a mountain
[1:02:44] in my way that God promised it and God's
[1:02:48] Gonna back up his
[1:02:52] word brother R would even say
[1:02:55] it we have confidence that God will move
[1:02:57] a mountain we have confidence in what
[1:02:59] God says but what about what you say God
[1:03:02] wants you to have confidence in what you
[1:03:03] say he said if you say what God's
[1:03:06] already said and you're filled with the
[1:03:07] Holy Ghost it's the same as de he
[1:03:09] speaking oh if we can God wants us to
[1:03:11] have that kind of faith that kind of
[1:03:14] confidence to believe that whatever you
[1:03:17] say you'll say maybe this morning I
[1:03:19] don't know if the Lord wants to heal me
[1:03:22] I don't know I don't know if the Lord
[1:03:23] wants to heal me of this two toothache
[1:03:24] now see brother Ram will say you you you
[1:03:26] can't hardly have faith for a toothache
[1:03:28] but you got to have faith for a body
[1:03:32] change we need we needed something to
[1:03:34] take us to higher Heights and that's
[1:03:37] what that was a type of in the 49th year
[1:03:39] where the man would come out with the
[1:03:41] trumpet and the the high priest in the
[1:03:43] 49th year blow that trumpet in time blow
[1:03:46] that trumpet in a space of time to take
[1:03:48] us to Eternity the 50th year takes you
[1:03:50] into eternity where you've been take you
[1:03:53] oh that youve been delivered from in
[1:03:55] your soul and your spirit and your body
[1:03:57] you've been taken up into higher Heights
[1:04:00] into a change what is it a release a
[1:04:02] release that takes you from the bonds of
[1:04:04] the earth that takes you from this from
[1:04:06] this Mortal realm that's what this 49th
[1:04:09] year message is supposed to bring to us
[1:04:12] he said the church was to go on to the
[1:04:14] full promise the church tonight should
[1:04:16] be in her Splendor of Glory she should
[1:04:18] be waiting for the coming of the Lord
[1:04:20] instead of that she's scattered
[1:04:22] everywhere wondering which is right is
[1:04:24] this right is that right I'll join this
[1:04:27] and go over here and down that oh return
[1:04:30] get away from those things oh that's
[1:04:31] what this message is for to build up our
[1:04:34] faith and our confidence to where we
[1:04:36] know what's right aren't you glad this
[1:04:38] morning that when you hear a preacher
[1:04:40] preach you know whether he's preaching
[1:04:41] right or
[1:04:42] not I know so many so many years I've
[1:04:45] heard people talk about that they they
[1:04:47] they struggled with just battling out
[1:04:49] people would say something behind the
[1:04:50] pullit and they didn't know whether it
[1:04:51] was right and they'd have to go research
[1:04:53] it out and you God brings you through
[1:04:55] those through those things through those
[1:04:57] times oh but God wants us to be up here
[1:05:00] where we have confidence and what is
[1:05:03] truth and what is right and we're not
[1:05:05] scattered around by on every wind of
[1:05:07] Doctrine he doesn't want us to just be
[1:05:08] like little children Blown Blown by
[1:05:11] every wind of Doctrine but rooted and
[1:05:14] grounded like a tree that's planted by
[1:05:16] the rivers of water and he would say
[1:05:18] when you see the trumpet of God sounding
[1:05:20] the word of God and God vindicating it
[1:05:22] with signs and wonders as he said it
[1:05:24] would do if the trumpet gives an
[1:05:26] uncertain sound the chief Captain won't
[1:05:28] vindicate the
[1:05:30] call now brother that was a stomach full
[1:05:33] the chief Captain won't vindicate the
[1:05:34] call for he said in Mark 16 all the
[1:05:38] world and these signs shall follow them
[1:05:40] that believe that's the chief captain in
[1:05:42] my name they shall cast out Devils they
[1:05:44] shall speak with new tongues oh he'll
[1:05:47] vindicate he said that's the certain
[1:05:49] sound the certain sound of the Gospel
[1:05:51] trumpet and we've seen it it Vindicated
[1:05:54] the gospel trumpet what does it do it
[1:05:56] declares his presence and his will for
[1:05:59] you the sound of the Gospel
[1:06:02] trumpet what what is that sound of
[1:06:04] Freedom declaring this morning as we get
[1:06:06] ready to close I really am about to
[1:06:09] close it's declaring that you were in
[1:06:11] him before the foundation of the world
[1:06:13] it's declaring that you had an
[1:06:15] inheritance that God thought of before
[1:06:16] the foundation of the world that God
[1:06:18] thought about you and knew that you
[1:06:19] would come to it it's declaring that
[1:06:21] there was a mystery in the back part of
[1:06:23] God's mind and you are that
[1:06:26] mystery that that gospel s that sound of
[1:06:29] Freedom this morning is declaring it's
[1:06:31] the seven Thunders declaring your
[1:06:33] complete Redemption that's the Seven
[1:06:35] Seals breaking the unfolding you your
[1:06:37] the mystery of your complete Redemption
[1:06:39] that's what the gospel trumpet sounds to
[1:06:41] you it's it's the sound that you are not
[1:06:44] under Satan's Dominion anymore that you
[1:06:46] don't have to take nothing from the
[1:06:47] devil that you can stand and oh stand
[1:06:50] like Caleb did and say I'm I'm taking
[1:06:52] that mountain I might be be an old man I
[1:06:54] might be feeble like Abraham did but if
[1:06:57] God gave the promise to Abraham then how
[1:06:59] much more will he fulfill the promise to
[1:07:01] a born again child of God that God that
[1:07:03] has the life of God living in
[1:07:07] you oh and that sound of freedom in
[1:07:11] Revelation chapter 10 John was acting
[1:07:14] out receiving that sound of Freedom when
[1:07:16] he said give me that little book give me
[1:07:19] that little book but you keep reading on
[1:07:20] down and he said unto me thou must
[1:07:22] prophesy again before many peoples and
[1:07:25] Nations and tongues and kings that sound
[1:07:28] of Freedom you take when you heard that
[1:07:29] sound of Freedom now you can speak it
[1:07:31] out to others you can speak it you can
[1:07:33] Echo it out and you can Echo out that I
[1:07:35] believe it like hady Wright sitting in
[1:07:38] there listening to brother R talking
[1:07:40] about how that he's still Jehovah Gyra
[1:07:42] today yes he's still the same God and
[1:07:45] she echoed out I that that's nothing but
[1:07:48] the truth and it was a little woman
[1:07:50] speaking what do we got this morning we
[1:07:51] got a woman speaking back this morning a
[1:07:54] woman speaking the bride has come to
[1:07:56] maturity a place where you she can say
[1:07:58] the same thing the same thing that God
[1:08:01] spoke through brother Brandon the sound
[1:08:03] of freedom in
[1:08:05] you brother or Jesus would say in
[1:08:08] Matthew chapter 16: 19 he said I will
[1:08:10] give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom
[1:08:12] of Heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind
[1:08:14] on Earth shall be bound in heaven and
[1:08:17] whatsoever thou shall loose on Earth
[1:08:19] shall be loosed in heaven now to think
[1:08:22] this morning the kind of power that's
[1:08:23] been given into the bride because she
[1:08:25] believes the same thing that if you say
[1:08:28] the same thing it could lose somebody
[1:08:31] from their sins if you say what God has
