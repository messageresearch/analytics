[0:16] services today here and let's brother
[0:18] way better your mobile call bow and pray
[0:22] that you will bless all the little bride
[0:24] around the world Lord just really to
[0:26] work to us give us understanding of you
[0:27] and thank you for this day Lord did she
[0:30] raise two thousand years ago we rolled
[0:33] about in the first things thank you for
[0:35] all the blessings you've given us most
[0:37] of all for your Holy Spirit
[0:38] thank you for revelation on your word
[0:40] and again this beautiful for the way it
[0:42] says for doing all those and Alabama and
[0:44] given the tribe immerses back I pray in
[0:46] Jesus name do you have your own bottles
[0:49] turn to Luke 24 I'm a little
[0:59] old-fashioned old-fashioned and have
[1:08] this listen if you don't have it I'm
[1:11] just I'm sorry Luke Luke 24:1
[1:21] now upon the first day of the week very
[1:24] early in the morning they came unto the
[1:25] sepulchre bringing the spices which they
[1:27] had prepared and certain others with
[1:29] them and they found the stone rolled
[1:31] away from the sepulchre and they entered
[1:34] and is found not the body of the Lord
[1:35] Jesus and it came to pass that were much
[1:38] perplexed thereabout behold two men
[1:40] stood by them in shining garments and as
[1:44] they were afraid they bowed down their
[1:46] faces to the earth and they said unto
[1:48] them why seek ye the living among the
[1:50] dead he is not here but just risen
[1:55] remember how he spake them to you when
[1:57] he was yet in Galilee this is Luke 24
[2:00] seven saying the Son of Man must be
[2:04] delivered into the hands of sinful men
[2:06] and be crucified and the third day rise
[2:08] again and they remembered his words and
[2:10] returned from the sepulchre and told all
[2:12] these things and
[2:13] eleven and do all the rest it was Mary
[2:16] Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother
[2:19] of James and the other women that were
[2:21] with them which told these things unto
[2:24] the Apostles and their words seemed to
[2:26] them as hotels and they believed them
[2:28] not then arose Peter and ran unto the
[2:31] sepulchre and stooping down he beheld
[2:33] the linen clothes laid by themselves and
[2:35] departed wandering and himself at that
[2:37] which was coming to pass verse 13 and
[2:40] behold two of them went the same day to
[2:43] a village called mass which was from
[2:46] Jerusalem about threescore furlongs and
[2:49] they talked together all these things
[2:51] which had happened and it came to pass
[2:53] while they came together and reason
[3:00] Jesus himself drew near and went with
[3:02] them but their eyes were holding that
[3:04] they should not know him and they said
[3:06] up to seven them what manner of
[3:08] communications are these that you have
[3:10] one to another as you walk in are sad
[3:12] and the one of them whose name was
[3:15] Cleopas sensory and said unto Him art
[3:17] thou only a stranger in Jerusalem and
[3:19] has not known the things which are
[3:20] coming to pass here these days and he
[3:23] said unto them what things and they said
[3:25] unto him concerning Jesus of Nazareth
[3:27] which was a prophet mighty in deed and
[3:29] word before God and all the people and
[3:31] how the chief priests and our rulers
[3:33] delivered him to be condemned to death
[3:36] and have crucified Him but which Russell
[3:38] did that have been him than he which
[3:40] should have redeemed Israel and aside
[3:42] all this today is the third day since
[3:44] these things were done
[3:46] yea and certain women also of her
[3:47] company made us Sistani which were early
[3:50] at the sepulchre and when they found not
[3:52] his body that came saying that they had
[3:55] also seen a vision of angels which said
[3:58] that he was alive and certain of them
[4:00] which were with
[4:01] us went to the sucker and found that
[4:03] even so swimmer said about him they saw
[4:06] none then he said unto them o fools are
[4:09] slow of heart to believe all that the
[4:11] prophets have spoken all not Christ to
[4:13] have suffered these things and to enter
[4:15] into his glory the beginning of Moses
[4:17] and all the prophets he expounded them
[4:18] in the Scriptures the things concerning
[4:20] himself okay we'll stop there make sure
[4:35] I'm staying in there okay today I'm
[4:40] going to go the objective right up front
[4:44] the objective today is to see that a
[4:47] daily choice to seek God is not optional
[4:49] but critical for special spiritual
[4:52] growth and I wanted to say to enjoy
[4:55] brother way to sermon this past Sunday
[4:57] because when he asked her to teach
[5:00] Sunday School Sunday morning last week I
[5:03] prayed and said or what would you have
[5:05] been teaching by the end of the service
[5:06] it was very clear to me what a negative
[5:08] teach on is very heavy on my heart this
[5:11] week and brother Wei preached a little
[5:13] bit in the second service about his new
[5:16] birth his journey very clear the journey
[5:19] of justification sanctification death
[5:20] the Holy Ghost and I've been dwelling on
[5:23] my experience throughout this week and I
[5:26] may or may not tie some of that into
[5:28] this lesson but the point is I think we
[5:31] need to think a lot about that and
[5:33] consider that but he taught him
[5:34] beautifully with that sixth seal sermon
[5:37] so
[5:39] the tile today is choosing Christ okay
[5:44] and this lesson I know automatically by
[5:45] the title of it a lot of you might think
[5:47] well that's for babe's Ryan's going to
[5:49] talk teach a lesson too young ones just
[5:52] coming in or something but this is
[5:53] really for everybody at every stage of
[5:56] your spiritual growth whether you're in
[5:58] the headstone or whether you just
[5:59] started a finger journey
[6:01] this goes for this applies to everybody
[6:03] it's not just for new Christmas choose
[6:07] you this day whom you will serve as for
[6:09] me and my house we will serve the Lord
[6:14] and the reason is so heavy on my heart
[6:17] is I've seen this for a long time but
[6:18] more here lately I've seen that people
[6:21] are seem to be thinking about
[6:22] Christianity about the new birth or
[6:25] whatever you want to call it as like a
[6:28] one-time thing like it's a an event that
[6:31] transpired rather than a process I think
[6:34] of it as a process there was a time of
[6:36] my life especially as a Baptist when I
[6:38] thought it was more like an event I got
[6:39] saved
[6:40] past tense it's done it's over now I'm
[6:43] going on to other things and that was
[6:45] kind of my mentality I think that's a
[6:47] lot of people's mentality about the
[6:49] reverse now in the message well I got
[6:51] the run again and now here I'm waiting
[6:53] on everybody else you know and that
[6:56] shouldn't their attitude so what what
[7:00] I'm talking about in this lesson is
[7:02] choosing Christ over and over again as a
[7:04] daily journey at the start of your day
[7:06] all throughout the day all the different
[7:08] ways that you seek God where you when
[7:10] you get up in the morning you first
[7:11] thing you do hit the floor and pray for
[7:13] a little while and that's choosing
[7:15] Christ and then maybe go read your Bible
[7:17] for a few minutes and that's choosing
[7:19] Christ and then why you only way to work
[7:20] you meditate on these things that things
[7:22] have been preached to things you read
[7:23] that's choosing Christ and the network
[7:26] you think on about well today maybe you
[7:28] pray without ceasing
[7:29] you have a profile a tooth that's
[7:30] choosen Christ on through your whole day
[7:32] all up to you go to bed at night you
[7:33] think about the Lord you pray read
[7:35] meditate your studies think on these
[7:37] things sing songs of worship and praise
[7:39] when I Drive at night I kind of have my
[7:42] own little church service I listen to
[7:43] sermons until I get sleepy
[7:44] I'll start getting slave doctrine on
[7:46] gospel music and have and sort of invite
[7:48] the Holy Spirit in to my truck as a way
[7:51] of praise and worship because he
[7:53] inhabits the praises of his people so
[7:55] that's no way of saying Lord now come in
[7:56] the couch and reveal yourself to me and
[7:58] then I'll starting the meditation and
[8:00] start thinking on these things you think
[8:03] that put me to sleep but that actually
[8:04] writes me a lot our adversary greatly
[8:11] desires to stop us from seeking God
[8:13] Satan realizes that Christians gain
[8:16] great strength from daily prayer Bible
[8:18] reading meditation fellowship and
[8:20] assembling with other believers and all
[8:22] the other aspects of the Christian life
[8:24] is powerless against the revealed Word
[8:26] of God therefore he tries to hinder us
[8:28] from receiving revelation tactics of the
[8:34] enemy so I've been thinking about a guy
[8:37] I work with is Hispanic he's a Catholic
[8:41] and he said he made a comment to me in
[8:44] one time he said when you die you're
[8:45] going to heaven or hell I said heaven he
[8:47] still are you sure I got a thing about
[8:49] it later on and he believes in purgatory
[8:52] because he's a Catholic I don't
[8:54] understand fully but I think what they
[8:55] believe it's basically that no matter
[8:57] how you live you die go to hell
[8:59] for a time to pay for your sins is that
[9:01] best thing just of it okay so I don't
[9:05] know but that's - damned purgatory if I
[9:07] was taught that and I believe that I
[9:09] live a pretty sloppy life I wouldn't
[9:11] care about sanctification I'm worried
[9:13] about reading the Bible or going to
[9:14] church cuz I gotta go to hell anyway
[9:16] when I die so what does it matter what
[9:18] kind of life you live and it kind of
[9:20] just I think that's what they did if
[9:26] it's not that I'm totally wrong forget
[9:27] us it but I think that's my
[9:29] understanding perfect
[9:30] is that they they go there for a while
[9:31] pay for their sins and they and then I
[9:33] got but anyway if that's what he
[9:35] believed it's no wonder why he lives
[9:36] just like all the other sinners that I
[9:39] work with that aren't even Christians he
[9:40] cusses like crazy
[9:41] and tells nasty jokes and all that kind
[9:45] of thing no concern about a Christian
[9:47] life or anything then but yet there are
[9:51] some Catholics who are really sincere
[9:53] buried the bobbum do go to masses and
[9:55] all those things so I'm not everybody
[9:57] it's just a dentist tactic he's trying
[10:00] to stop people from seeing God and the
[10:02] Baptist
[10:04] I wasn't directly taught once saved
[10:07] always saved but it was kind of a
[10:08] generally understood concept when you
[10:10] get saved no matter what you do the rest
[10:13] of your life you're going to go to
[10:15] heaven and so I've seen many people in
[10:17] the Baptist we're almost there that
[10:19] would get saved and then go out there
[10:21] but the devil never come to church never
[10:23] eat the Bible never pray and somehow
[10:25] magically they're going to just go to
[10:27] heaven when they got and I don't
[10:28] understand that but that's what the
[10:30] devil teaches people just stop him from
[10:32] seeking God
[10:33] okay so why seek God if I prayed the
[10:36] prayer of salvation
[10:38] I'm saved no matter what I do and then
[10:42] but yeah as a Baptist I did reading pray
[10:44] I remember I want to pray but I didn't I
[10:47] didn't think it was a necessity I did it
[10:49] more like because I just want know more
[10:50] about God so there are some people are
[10:53] sincere about his church but there are a
[10:55] lot of them that because of that concept
[10:58] they don't seek God all right number
[11:00] three seed doctrine this is one of many
[11:03] in the message that we've heard of and
[11:06] it's very common it's very common more
[11:09] often I think more places believe that
[11:11] than not but why seek God if I came with
[11:15] a seat and this is the doctrine I'm
[11:17] talking about that you can receive in
[11:18] you of eternal life by you're not
[11:20] lay there dormant and then with a work
[11:23] contract path that just came to life and
[11:25] that's it you're done you're all set
[11:26] devil says you're okay sit down or don't
[11:29] even come to church at all doesn't
[11:30] matter you're okay
[11:32] well I seek God if I came with a seat in
[11:34] it I'm either pre dispatcher eternal
[11:37] life or I'm not pertinent to eternal
[11:39] life what does it matter about what I do
[11:41] whether I seek God or not that's the
[11:44] concept tactics love to them these and
[11:48] many other false doctrines are used by
[11:50] saying to try to stop us from seeking
[11:52] God Satan knows that God promises to
[11:54] reward those that seek Him he rewards
[11:57] them with revelation which Satan is
[11:59] powerless against okay a lot of people
[12:06] the message is seems like to them the
[12:09] new birth is like when they got born
[12:11] again also there in the headstone and
[12:13] there's no growth process you can talked
[12:15] about or even thought of and it's just
[12:18] like youth you are yeah I got born again
[12:19] I'm okay I'm in the headstone I'm ready
[12:21] for the rapture all right
[12:23] it doesn't work like that
[12:25] [Music]
[12:28] Matthew 16 and I say also under thee
[12:30] that thou art Peter and upon this rock
[12:32] I'll build my church and the gates of
[12:34] Hell shall not prevail against it hey
[12:36] that's the scripture I'm referring to
[12:38] unless like the gates of Hell cannot
[12:40] prevail against the revealed Word of God
[12:41] that's what we want he does not want us
[12:43] to have it and he is fervently trying to
[12:46] keep us from coming to that in any way
[12:47] I'm just showing you some of his tactics
[12:50] but he's trying to stop us from finding
[12:52] that Hebrews 11:6 but without faith it
[12:56] is impossible to please him for he that
[12:58] comes to God must believe that he is
[13:00] that he is a reward of damned ability to
[13:02] seek Him and I'll read the scripture in
[13:06] another slide because it's coming up
[13:08] again revelation 3 behold I stand at the
[13:13] door knock If any man hear my voice and
[13:15] open the door I will come in to him and
[13:18] will sup with him in here with me to him
[13:20] that overcometh will I grant to sit with
[13:22] me in my throne even as I also overcame
[13:24] and sat down my father in his promise
[13:27] and matthew SE mark 13 and ye shall be
[13:31] hated of all men for my name's sake but
[13:34] he that shall endure to the end the same
[13:36] shall be saved i think that's the one
[13:37] brother wait folks a lot but there's an
[13:40] enduring and there's an overcoming and
[13:41] not just a sitting and waiting on
[13:43] something to happen that's not what
[13:44] we're seeing the picture so it must
[13:47] overcome Laodicea we have to overcome
[13:50] what I call busyness not a business
[13:53] establishment busyness as in we're also
[13:56] busy that's one day after a common I
[13:59] don't say put down things and don't do
[14:00] anything just put God first give them
[14:03] the tithe of your time right off the top
[14:05] start of the day we're as quick as you
[14:06] can in your day the first opportunity
[14:08] read the Bible and pray and do that
[14:10] every day and then go
[14:11] your flowerbeds or your you know work or
[14:14] whatever whatever that's you have to do
[14:16] because we all have things to do so this
[14:19] overcoming false doctrine overcoming our
[14:20] own ideas against the word and our own
[14:23] ideas that we're okay that we don't need
[14:26] a sitcom
[14:27] those are things get it show endure to
[14:30] the end shall be saved and about the
[14:33] overcoming john 5:39 search the
[14:36] Scriptures for in them you think you
[14:38] have eternal life and there they which
[14:40] testify of me now I put this little note
[14:43] Jesus speaking to the Jews a group of
[14:45] people very studied in the work so say
[14:47] he's talking these people who are who
[14:49] have studied a lot I'm talking about
[14:51] studying a lot but you know see God for
[14:53] revelation they had a lot of the
[14:55] understanding of the letter okay but but
[14:58] not the revelation with it and a lot of
[15:00] man's ideas and theology mixed in with
[15:03] it we must not only study the letter
[15:04] word but carefully prayerfully let it be
[15:08] mixed with faith living God and trusting
[15:10] him to quicken it to us okay so our part
[15:13] studying pray let's make herself
[15:15] available his part is to reveal it okay
[15:19] we can't prevent it to ourselves we're
[15:20] not saying that but we have to get into
[15:23] the word Hebrews for one let us
[15:26] therefore fear lest a promise being left
[15:29] us of entering into his rest any of you
[15:31] should seem to come short of it
[15:33] for unto us was the gospel preached as
[15:35] well as unto them that was the Jews if
[15:39] you go back in the previous chapter you
[15:40] storm out the Jews huh I put that in
[15:42] there and somehow it got left out anyway
[15:46] them the Jews but the word preached did
[15:48] not profit them not being mixed with
[15:50] faith and then they heard it I'm gonna
[15:57] pause for just a second let me see if I
[16:00] can fix this
[16:13] what happened I never got the internet
[16:16] to connect so I'm having to go on one of
[16:19] these that I recently there's like my
[16:22] backup version and never could get the
[16:23] internet to connect so there was a few
[16:25] things left out of here so that's all
[16:27] right we'll do our best okay
[16:37] modern myths make clear about prophecy
[16:40] it's got to be the unleavened bread of
[16:42] God the Word of God the unadulterated
[16:45] Word of God which man shall live by
[16:47] every word receives out of mouth of God
[16:52] okay now here in this church we've heard
[16:55] that I go for the word for many years an
[16:57] adult read it means not mixed with false
[16:59] doctrine and man's ideas and brother
[17:01] Dale was always fought against the false
[17:02] doctrines all of our ministers preaching
[17:04] against the boss doctrines and brandish
[17:06] straight line the truth so we have an
[17:08] opportunity a great opportunity to see
[17:11] the truth and to take a body change in
[17:13] the rapture and see the resurrection all
[17:16] those things but and we don't have an
[17:19] excuse okay but that's what it takes is
[17:21] the unadulterated Word of God but we
[17:24] still have to study and commit to to
[17:26] read listening to the things one thing
[17:28] man gave you like to do is go back and
[17:30] download those the quotes the sermon
[17:32] notes that all ministers use with their
[17:34] sermon those are up on the Internet
[17:36] y'all can download those and go back and
[17:39] read those notes between services after
[17:42] each service go back and read those
[17:43] notes and helps you stay more in tune
[17:45] with what's being preached
[17:47] [Music]
[17:50] see
[17:59] seventh week of town and I think if
[18:03] Daniel reading the prophets before him
[18:05] and had this kind of an understanding
[18:06] that he was near the end and sought God
[18:09] to find out how close the end was and I
[18:12] think we're justified by saying that
[18:13] were at the end of the road now put on
[18:16] non sackcloth and ashes but throw off
[18:18] the things of the world in our cares of
[18:20] this life and seek God to find out what
[18:22] day of the year we are in because we're
[18:25] see we're at the end and so that the
[18:27] church will fast and pray and be ready
[18:29] okay and steps birth man this is the
[18:33] thing that I'm interested in the kingdom
[18:34] of God whether I maintain my home
[18:36] whether I maintain my family Worth or
[18:38] maintain whatever it is let me maintain
[18:40] Christ our hope of glory
[18:56] well
[18:58] okay I might eventually have to just get
[19:00] on the internet because okay yeah
[19:04] because it's not that way
[19:11] and y'all let me pause for a minute
[19:13] thank amongst ourselves pretty sure
[19:17] something is gonna be it's not gonna be
[19:19] left out every month that's that's a
[19:32] good idea
[19:33] it says connected but it's just showing
[19:36] it's really weak so pretty sure I'm
[19:43] going to miss something but I'll put
[19:44] that on
[19:56] hotspot that's it how many that's very
[19:59] often so
[20:59] now Thanks so quiet
[21:25] say I left out my house I don't know
[21:28] what else was missing some part about
[21:30] that now
[21:33] I don't remember read this one yet but
[21:43] my moderates still read that one young
[21:45] memory okay okay I read that yeah
[21:50] exactly
[21:51] and I read seven weeks of Daniel fast
[21:54] and pray every read that read this let's
[22:00] pick up there Hebrews 3 4 we are micro
[22:03] takers of Christ if we hold the
[22:05] beginning of our confidence steadfast in
[22:06] this again
[22:07] while this said today if you hear his
[22:09] voice harden not your hearts as in the
[22:12] provocation you said will run around I
[22:14] have a part in my heart I believe and
[22:16] I'm thinking if you don't go on and pray
[22:19] and studying seek out that could be a
[22:20] final part in your heart because if you
[22:22] have a hard heart God can't deal with
[22:24] you
[22:24] if you've cut off all these channels
[22:26] then how can you come in see you must
[22:28] infiltrate into your being in some way
[22:30] and I like to open up all the ways I
[22:33] possibly can my lord my lord I pray Lord
[22:35] study and I'm seeking new and coming to
[22:37] church reading the Bible and listening
[22:38] sermons and all these different ways
[22:40] trying to leave as many channels open
[22:43] for God to come into as possible I'm not
[22:47] doing this to make fun of anybody okay I
[22:49] don't know who that guy is just found a
[22:51] picture on the Internet
[22:52] yeah you I'm yeah it just saves me yeah
[22:54] all right I'm trying to paint a picture
[22:56] in y'all's mind of what's happening here
[22:58] or what I believe is happening this is
[23:00] kind of overemphasized for effect okay
[23:03] something anybody here doing this I'm
[23:06] just saying dear Lord I'm just desperate
[23:09] for more of you I want you to take
[23:11] control to my life as I surrender
[23:13] everything to you
[23:15] well if you're if this is how you are
[23:20] and this is how you just kind of relax
[23:22] and the leg back and Laodicean and and
[23:24] stand up on all the modern events and
[23:27] and everything in your news and social
[23:29] media or whatever whatever your thing is
[23:31] that's distracting you I have my things
[23:33] that distract me and you know just
[23:36] everybody has some little things that
[23:37] kind of get in their way
[23:38] shun those things I'm not saying don't
[23:40] do them I'm just saying put Christ first
[23:42] choose Christ first and but if you
[23:45] approach God like that I'm pretty sure
[23:47] he won't hear what you're saying because
[23:49] he's not convinced you know if you're
[23:52] not really convinced you won't be
[23:53] concerned if he's not convinced that
[23:55] you're convinced if you're laid back
[23:57] like that and saying you know nowhere
[23:59] does he never fast you never studied you
[24:01] never pray van gogh's would be like are
[24:03] you sure you're really desperate here
[24:04] yeah and pictures are worth a thousand
[24:10] words the pictures speak for themselves
[24:11] okay
[24:18] [Applause]
[24:22] so I'm making yourself available to I
[24:24] want to make that point it's not it
[24:26] doesn't mean to just say Lord Here I am
[24:28] making yourself available it's more like
[24:31] a lot of times actions more than words
[24:33] you know you just make yourself
[24:34] available by studying and seeking God
[24:41] now here's another example I don't have
[24:47] to really go and read that y'all know
[24:48] the essence here this is a Pharisee in
[24:51] the public and Jesus talked about them
[24:53] in Luke 18 verse 9 basically the first
[24:57] thing the publican went to the temple to
[24:59] pray
[24:59] the Pharisee said Lord I fast several so
[25:02] many times in the week and I give tithes
[25:05] of all that I possessed and he said I'm
[25:07] not like this publican you know and the
[25:09] publican wouldn't even hold wouldn't
[25:11] lift up his head but he held his head
[25:12] down smote upon his breast and said it
[25:13] will be merciful to me a sinner so what
[25:16] to them too went down to their house
[25:17] justified and Jesus said that obviously
[25:20] the publican well that should be our
[25:23] attitude this is not the way we approach
[25:24] God with Lord I'm in the message I've
[25:26] been here so many years I've read all
[25:28] these tapes and I've listened I read all
[25:31] the books and listen to all the tapes
[25:32] and snabel should be like him the humble
[25:35] approach if brother Dale says to read
[25:37] across the mystery and you've read it
[25:40] 80 times read it 81 you know what I mean
[25:43] because now there's something coming
[25:44] forth that there's light coming forth
[25:47] that maybe it was darkness to you before
[25:49] but if you're going do like he says and
[25:50] read that for the 80th or 81st time you
[25:54] might get something you didn't get the
[25:55] last time you will actually I believe
[25:57] you
[25:57] without a doubt because the word of god
[26:00] is eternal it just keeps unfolding and
[26:02] you can read the same one sermon a
[26:04] hundred times and get something new
[26:05] every time john 15 if you abide in me
[26:14] and my words abide in you ye shall ask
[26:16] what you will and it shall be done unto
[26:18] you his word can only abide in you after
[26:22] it's been quickly otherwise it can just
[26:24] be a good thought your mind and you can
[26:27] be talked out of it psalm 119:11 thy
[26:31] word have i hid in my heart my heart
[26:33] that i might not sin against thee i this
[26:39] is good versus perfect what I'm talking
[26:42] about is the words good addresses
[26:43] perfect faith the words good the first
[26:45] is perfect then when God starts
[26:48] something it is pure nothing wrong with
[26:50] it but it still requires growth or
[26:53] maturity for example babies start life
[26:55] with all they need they just need growth
[26:58] seeds finding the earth have all they
[27:00] need then just need growth new believers
[27:03] come to God for salvation likewise they
[27:05] need prose x19 he said unto them have ye
[27:09] received the Holy Ghost since she
[27:11] believes so there's a believing there's
[27:13] a start there's a justification or
[27:15] salvation and we'll call it then there's
[27:17] also a sanctification go on keep going
[27:19] and then there's a sanctification of
[27:21] cleansing instead of stop the source
[27:22] then there's a feeling of the Holy Ghost
[27:24] but there's no way there's a refilling
[27:25] and there's a continual unfolding of
[27:27] more of God from revelation to
[27:29] Revelation never stop never stop never
[27:32] stop seeking God
[27:38] so believing is the start not the end of
[27:42] our journey
[27:44] James one for every good gift and every
[27:48] perfect gift is from above and cometh
[27:50] down from the Father of lights with whom
[27:52] is no variableness there is no
[27:54] variableness neither shadow of turning
[27:56] this is the strong some courts good
[27:58] means upright or agreeable so doesn't
[28:02] mean perfect or complete you're not in
[28:04] the headstone when you start at the
[28:06] beginning their journey it's a good gift
[28:08] it's from God okay but you're not
[28:11] complete yet but you're agreeable which
[28:13] means you're going to continue saying
[28:14] amen to the word you're going to
[28:15] continue moving on every time God moves
[28:18] you're Conner you say Amen Lord and you
[28:19] keep on moving up a little bit higher it
[28:21] moves you only into st. vacation you say
[28:23] Amen you keep on going you're still
[28:24] agreeing you're not stopping with
[28:26] justification and you're not stopping
[28:28] there sanctification you're gonna keep
[28:30] going and then every perfect gift strong
[28:33] says finished complete or full grown
[28:36] that's also from God and one doesn't do
[28:39] what the other they're both from God the
[28:41] beginning at the end of your journey is
[28:43] all for God but he's gonna keep moving
[28:45] you forward as long as you'll allow him
[28:48] to Hebrews 12 wherefore seeing we also
[28:52] are compassed about with so great a
[28:55] cloud of witnesses let us lay aside
[28:57] every weight and the sandwich dust so
[28:59] easily beset us and let us run with
[29:02] patience the race that is set before us
[29:03] looking unto Jesus the author and the
[29:06] strong says originator like a starter
[29:09] and then finisher of our faith
[29:12] and finisher means Perfector so he
[29:16] originates it and then we finish it a
[29:17] complete set who for the joy set before
[29:20] him endured the cross despising the
[29:22] shame and is set down at the right hand
[29:23] of the throne of God the interval for
[29:29] the bench set and that's what the
[29:31] Christian does when you're planning at
[29:33] Christ Jesus
[29:34] everything that you have need of and
[29:35] Earth's tourney is in you when you're
[29:38] seeing the Holy Spirit one thing I have
[29:40] to do is drink drink and push out push
[29:42] out just drink - you can't drink no more
[29:44] if you have need of divine healing go to
[29:47] God's Word and transform it until you
[29:48] push out if you need more of God just
[29:52] keep drinking pushing out and price an
[29:55] inexhaustible fountain of life and if
[29:56] you're finding in him the only thing out
[29:58] to do is drink of its goodness push it
[29:59] up we're gonna need open this restaurant
[30:00] it's all drinking the rest in peace it's
[30:03] not you struggle and strive and pull
[30:05] that you defeat the very curse of God we
[30:07] you representing
[30:08] when you do that so I'm not saying try
[30:11] to figure out I'm not sure maybe brother
[30:13] Brennan when he said you can study too
[30:15] much he might have been meaning like
[30:16] trying to figure things out because that
[30:18] would be studying too much I don't think
[30:20] as far as reading the Bible every day
[30:22] and listen to message every day I don't
[30:24] think that's staying too much and that
[30:26] to me is drinking drinking of the
[30:29] fountain I don't talk about human
[30:35] behavior humans are creatures of habit
[30:39] we form good and bad habits throughout
[30:42] our lives the bad habits come easy but
[30:45] how do we form good habits reading the
[30:47] Bible and the message is an example of a
[30:49] good habit but naturally was struggled
[30:51] to do this on a regular basis romans 7
[30:54] 19 for the good that I would I do not
[30:59] but the evil which I would not that I do
[31:03] okay that's Paul saying you know in
[31:05] other words I want to do good but I do
[31:07] it wrong I want to read the message the
[31:09] Bible gonna do it but evil which I would
[31:11] not that I do Matthew 26 watch and pray
[31:15] that you enter not into temptation the
[31:17] spirit indeed is willing but the flesh
[31:20] is weak
[31:22] a little bit about the human will
[31:26] so still under the topic of human
[31:29] behavior but human whale is strong God
[31:33] gave us free choice which is a powerful
[31:35] thing
[31:35] and that we could use to serve Him or
[31:37] not we can choose to read his work or
[31:40] not we can choose to override our flesh
[31:42] the carnal will as well and the old
[31:45] saying goes where there's a will there's
[31:47] a way
[31:48] so what things can motivate us to stop
[31:51] our bad habits and form good habits
[31:57] these are just two ideas I mean we know
[31:59] about revelation but this is just one of
[32:01] my desk I don't know I'm just doing it
[32:02] in there just saying naturally speaking
[32:05] not even even talking about the Bible
[32:07] for a moment I'm just talking about
[32:08] natural things of life sometimes a
[32:11] behavior change can be the result of new
[32:13] information or a major event and life
[32:15] that a person experiences for example I
[32:18] was an idiot with handling money when
[32:20] Gabe and I got married I was going deep
[32:22] into debt and trying to dig a deeper
[32:24] hole my sister told me and my mom told
[32:27] me about Dave Ramsey new information I
[32:29] changed my course I quit going into and
[32:33] the way I was going just like everybody
[32:34] else going deeper into debt and I
[32:36] started doing making better choices it
[32:38] was a habit change because of new
[32:39] information okay when I was 15 and that
[32:45] was church when I was 14 I started
[32:48] wanting to read the Bible just because I
[32:49] wanna know more about God and just
[32:51] because I thought I mean a hypocrite
[32:53] because I don't know what the Bible says
[32:55] and I'm claiming to be a Christian I
[32:56] didn't think it was necessary but I
[32:58] thought I should do it maybe so I
[33:01] started reading the Bible I couldn't
[33:03] never get it done I would read maybe
[33:05] twice a week I found out about times 15
[33:08] that it takes a resolve a determination
[33:10] if you read it every day you have to
[33:13] come to a resolve and just something
[33:15] kind of clicked with me I said if I
[33:16] don't make time for God I'll never find
[33:19] time for God but it's just kind of a
[33:21] click I wouldn't call it necessarily
[33:22] Revelation it's just more like a
[33:24] information or realization a realization
[33:28] that it wouldn't happen if you don't
[33:29] make it happen ok so those are examples
[33:36] of what I came to as just a just an on
[33:40] the natural side of things then a
[33:42] revelation when a child of God receives
[33:43] a revelation of the word often the
[33:46] result is a change in behavior and
[33:47] usually the more the word is revealed to
[33:49] a person the more he or she increases in
[33:52] fergus II the desire to see God more
[33:55] okay the prophet Elijah skip on down
[34:01] then we wonder sometimes well wonder why
[34:03] I can't have no more blessings you don't
[34:05] want you let down your prayer life you
[34:07] said well I'm a Christian well that's
[34:09] the more sign you should pray more than
[34:11] ever read the Bible every day pray every
[34:14] day don't make any decisions too harshly
[34:17] or too quickly without first considering
[34:19] talking about it being born again now
[34:25] this is from our pastor from back in
[34:27] September 19th last year being born
[34:31] again and whether the kindness was the
[34:32] subtitle so in the spiritual children
[34:35] you've got to eat the Word of God study
[34:38] the Word of God you know pray and seek
[34:40] God and ask him to reveal these things
[34:42] to you instead of just saying oh I
[34:45] believe that let it be a part of you and
[34:47] if you have the new birth you will
[34:49] desire right is that what we read you'll
[34:52] desire the sincere milk of the word that
[34:54] we may grow thereby because see that
[34:56] will be a part of your life why wouldn't
[34:59] you want to grow in Christ why would
[35:00] that not be your desire to want to know
[35:02] about God and this is brother Bob a
[35:06] couple months before that my steer this
[35:09] is July 4th last year you know that's
[35:13] such a strange thing for many people to
[35:15] grab ahold of that the opening of the
[35:18] word is going to take us out of here I
[35:20] was telling somebody about that recently
[35:22] they begin to say well do you mean to
[35:23] tell me that sounds almost like you're
[35:26] saying that they're saying that it's a
[35:28] knowledge that you're just accumulating
[35:30] knowledge no but what it is see God this
[35:34] kind of knowledge can't come just from
[35:36] studying like you're in a school setting
[35:37] or whatever but this kind of knowledge
[35:40] is when that book drops I'm sorry that
[35:42] block drops into the slot this is a bulb
[35:45] phrase I don't understand exactly but
[35:47] he's saying the rep of the word you know
[35:49] it's quick and becomes revelation right
[35:51] drops to your heart
[35:52] all right block drops into the slide and
[35:55] it begins to change your life and so
[35:58] that's what the experience that I'm
[35:59] talking about how can even approach to
[36:01] explain something like that unless
[36:03] you've lived it unless you've done
[36:04] unless you've gone through it it seems
[36:07] fantastical that's the billy-bob word it
[36:11] seems fantastical to imagining that the
[36:13] believing that living God's Word will
[36:15] produce him inside of you inside of your
[36:18] that's to allow him to a tabernacle
[36:21] himself inside your members that he
[36:23] would use your hand and use your feet
[36:25] and that you could yield yourself but
[36:26] just accumulated yourself the word by
[36:29] studying it and reading it and that
[36:30] would allow God the tabernacle himself
[36:34] inside of you but yet it's true I
[36:37] believe it and time Redemption we're
[36:41] almost out of time so we're going to
[36:42] talk about redeeming time
[36:45] Ephesians 5 wherefore he said awake the
[36:48] sleekest and arise from the dead across
[36:50] forgive thee like see that you walk
[36:52] circumspectly not as fool's but as wise
[36:54] redeeming the time because the days are
[36:57] evil wherefore be not unwise but
[36:59] understanding what the will of the Lord
[37:00] is or what the Word of God is it's time
[37:03] to understand this the revelations here
[37:04] and is all available to us it's just
[37:06] time for us to get into it and be not
[37:08] drunk with wine wherein is excess but be
[37:10] filled with the spirit speaking to
[37:12] yourselves in Psalms and hymns I like
[37:14] that because that's the word but also
[37:16] hearing spiritual songs singing and
[37:19] making melody in your heart the Lord
[37:20] giving thanks always for all things into
[37:22] God the Father and the father in the
[37:24] name of our Lord Jesus Christ being your
[37:26] social that's another in the fear of God
[37:28] and this is just a few verses later
[37:30] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[37:32] also loved the church gave himself for
[37:34] it
[37:34] they might sanctify and cleanse with the
[37:36] washing of water 5 work and how can you
[37:42] be washed by the water the word unless
[37:43] you're staying in it time Redeemer this
[37:47] is the definition of a time Redeemer one
[37:50] who redeems time we are living in a very
[37:57] fast-paced age where we can so busy that
[38:00] there is no time for anything
[38:03] therefore we must make time for God with
[38:06] a not simplifying time for him time
[38:09] Redemption this is still the same topic
[38:10] but vanity gave us instructions to
[38:12] Daniel how can we spend waste less time
[38:15] gambling swimming hole on Sundays no
[38:18] time for the Lord okay so basically I
[38:22] know what I'm going to pull holes and
[38:24] swimming holes and gambling here but
[38:26] other things that
[38:27] let it get in our way bitter on before
[38:30] to an on button if from dance spell
[38:33] shall seek the Lord thy God and I shall
[38:35] find it if that city was all heart with
[38:37] all that soul closings 1 and unit were
[38:41] sometimes alienated and enemies in your
[38:43] mind by wicked works yet now have to
[38:45] reconcile and the body was flesh through
[38:47] death to present you holy and
[38:49] unblameable and our improvable in the
[38:50] side if you continue in the faith
[38:53] grounded and settled and be not moved
[38:55] away from the hope of the gospel which
[38:56] he had heard which was preached and
[38:59] every creature lives under heaven we're
[39:00] about Paul administer wherefore we ought
[39:06] to give the more earnest heed of things
[39:07] where furless anytime should let them
[39:09] slip and basically dispense recommends
[39:12] how to risk a peewit neglect so great
[39:14] salvation no infirmities and then of
[39:18] Philippians one must give them the end
[39:20] that he would have begun a good work
[39:22] will perform it unto the day of Jesus
[39:24] Christ you have any questions thank you
[39:28] okay
