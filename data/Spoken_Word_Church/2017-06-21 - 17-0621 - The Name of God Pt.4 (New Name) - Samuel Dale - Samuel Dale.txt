Description:
10)  «  26-3       †        THE.REVELATION.OF.JESUS.CHRIST  -  
     Now that is the revelation: Jesus Christ is God. The Jehovah of the Old Testament is the Jesus of the New. No matter how hard you try, you can't prove there are THREE Gods. But it also takes a revelation by the Holy Spirit to make you understand the truth that He is One. It takes a revelation to see that the Jehovah of the Old Testament is the Jesus of the New. Satan crept into the church and blinded the people to this truth. And when they were blinded to it, it wasn't long until the Church of Rom

11)  ZECHARIAH 14:9
»     9     †     And the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one LORD, and his name one.

12)  «  332-3       †        LAODICEAN.CHURCH.AGE  -  CHURCH.AGE.BOOK  CPT.9
    Yes, that is true, but the real translation is not "God of truth". It is "God of the AMEN". So we read it, "shall bless himself in the God of the AMEN, and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of the AMEN; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from My eyes. For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create, for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy. And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in My people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her; nor the voice of crying," Hallelujah. Here is Jehovah of the Old Testament, "the God of the Amen". Here is Jesus of the New Testament, "the God of the Amen". Hear, Oh Israel, the Lord thy God is ONE God. There it is again, the Jehovah of the Old Testament is the Jesus of the New. "Hear, Oh, Israel the Lord thy God is ONE God." The New Testament does not reveal ANOTHER God, it is a further revelation of the ONE AND SAME GOD. Christ did not come down to make Himself known. He did not come to reveal the Son. He came to reveal and make known the Fath...

hidden manna and will give him a white stone in that stone a new name written which no man knoweth said he that receiveth it okay go over to 3-1 now this is what that would have been Pergamus all right then we're coming up to the Sardis Turk aids and unto the Angel of the church in Sardis write these things says he that hath the seven spirits of God in the seven stars I know thy works that thou has a name that they live us and our dead okay now back here they had tonight not back in the Pergamon they had the name now the prophet said they had the name in this age this age it stayed come down to the fourth the fifth page he said their loss tonight all right so then we pick on up going over to the verse 8 and I know thy works and behold I have set before thee an open door is the revelation of the deity of Jesus Christ right no man has can shut it for thou has a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name so it begins to be able to come back all right the name is coming back into being all right now we go to 312 to pick up a thought for tonight to him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go to more out and I will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god and I'll write upon him my new name I brought around him when we get to it you see I write upon him the name of my god he said that's Jesus the name of the city of my god that's Jesus which is a New Jerusalem coming down out of heaven I'll write upon him my new name so we'll get to those things and try to coverage you may be seated the Lord of it is blessing now if you want to have some questions that's reading I want to start a little early to try to conclude this about the name of God this would be the fourth message and trying to cover it and I want to try to finish it up if we can if you have any questions feel free to ask and do now don't get all blowed out and run up and start trying to figure everything out brother Dale is not out here going to tell you no no new name of God all right I've said it Sunday you know and I'm saying it again until the name of Jesus comes to an end in the basis of His redemptive plan then his name will remain Jesus right after we going to rapture he will go to Israel as Jesus then you find him throughout the Book of Revelations after then as known in still as the name of Jesus so we're not trying to figure out some new name but we're trying to put out all the information that's what I want to do I've done this before put out all the information I can and then leave it to death but now the face run through what we've been talking about we talked about the name of God all right now I think over these things and thinking about it today a lot and when you say the name of God now over here in this Baptist Church if you got up there and you said the name of God he said well the name of God is God you know all right that would that would be the way they say it the name of God is God all right now what do you think though when you say that the only name God ever had is Jesus can you accept that Rd have to have some other way of working it down to bring it to Jesus and then let it be that the earthly part announces it you know or whatever just remember Gabriel come and spoke the nine first to Mary all right where'd he come from he didn't come from Earth he came from glory to announce that name all right now I've tried my best to get you to look at it over and over to think about it but I know these human brains I know I have one it don't work too good but I have one if they ever have a brain transplant I'm gonna be the first one to put down for it you know I want a brain transplant because this one's wore out looking but now I don't want I wanted to make sure that they got the little cards you stick in your your telephone you know and every what it does you know it captures or your computer and it captures all the information and on that little card and then you can put I just want to make sure if they give me a new brain I want it to be workable material but to plug in what has been made known to them all right because that's the way I want it all right but now see we say I'm as honest as can be now trying to get you to think there was a time we read when we're back in organized religion and he making a few years ago or something we read it where he said Jesus Messiah I come in my father's name what we thought they were three of them and one sent the other one in his name see we think it's like that I'd say now brother Colley I'm going to send you down in my name see we think that's what was being done but just remembered they're just one true and living God and remember now then being just one true and living God then if Jesus wasn't God were you and I had uh huh and she being one true and living God then he didn't send a second person he didn't send the Holy Ghost down he didn't send another person we believe the message right what'd he do he who he who Almighty God came himself right all right Almighty God came himself so it's not sending somebody else in the name it's bringing a name forth jesus said if you've seen me you've seen the father but there was a time we thought that was a second person right he did when he said I come in my father's name well you know he's here and we never had any talks until we heard of this message now be honest with me I try to be with you and try to lay out things in it the best honestly I can and I know I'm accused of being deep and Sadie but I don't see anything that's deep about it to talk about the name of God I just don't understand that I know one thing we will read some things in the met with retirin said you over the old Jesus and you he said if you don't get a direct revelation from God of that you don't have it see then the reason I read about the thing we've been through it we know the name of God was in for ages look to the fourth age when the fifth age came into being he says you got a name that you're living but you did but running said the name was lost in the dark ages now we've been over that and over that understand was it the name of Jesus Jes us that they just got where they couldn't pronounce it anymore or was it the revelation of the supreme deity of knowing who that is now which one is it is it letters on a page that we can quote Jes you that or is it a revelation within our heart of who that person really is and that person I'm going about to Almighty God see we've got it all in our mind and we still it's hard to fathom and bring it down see we would all say in our older day God is the spirit who taught us the spirit he's just the spirit is floating around well we've come to the message and heard the prophets say God is not like the wind I got these laying in the desk in there if you want to be bent over over and over he said he's not like the winds that God is a being he said he's not just a myth or a thought he's a being he's a person well you know what he always was that do we think before the world ever begun and back in his mind or something way back over there somewhere that he was just floating around us no we're going to get to this the Lord willing start Sunday and pick up a little bit weights kind of moving into the realm of redemption of mankind on the Godhead I'm just going plain go back into the very who is God you know and start from there this is the background for service is a background to preach on who is God are the Godhead you know or the you know to understand Almighty God and see then the the greatest point is to see that his name is Jesus now you know yourself come on be honest you know yourself twenty-eight thirty forty years ago on back or something or some of the new ones coming in there was a time when somebody said to you and they said well Jesus is the name of God well he's one of the three well did the other two how nice well that was God yeah it's his name of God I don't understand you he you know well we know that the word God this means object of worship but does that solve the problem remember he created angels they worshipped him that's the first thing they created that made him God so you didn't have to wait till he come down to mankind to be God because that was running into self-existing we'll get back on these things but I want you to go with me and I don't this that it wasn't the name j esus that was lost in the ages it was the Word of God eating away by that cankerworm pong worm locust caterpillar till it ate it down until they didn't they were believing in a trinity become out believing in the trinity well then there's no way that could be true well yet we believed it right come on let your mind float back to where you come from and think about what you used to think about God and compare it with the way you think now what you thought you saw was God in three persons yeah he was one of the three the father said the Holy Ghost down you know the profits that he came himself then who was that that walked the short of Galilee who was it Almighty God himself that was when it began to be picking up to understand that you could bring the name of God because you say something to a theologian wages not slap your jobs well you're trying to find a name for God much holy and you know we can't do that but listen church what was his name before the world ever begun well we don't know that then you don't know what your prophet has said got a thing wait to hit the corner nothing about old daddy coming along saying not your prophet you know I like to say it like that you claim brother round them to be a prophet why don't you believe me why don't you say what he says instead of saying what you think he said why don't you say what he says about it instead of what you think it says it's your prophet see then knowing it was not the name Jesus that was lost well you ain't quoting what you probably said cause prophet said his night lost yeah you know got it laying here I'll read it minute he said we come out of calling him a Trinity and that's true see how we got born again because without a revelation from God we're still just as much Trinitarian as we ever was not now see then as I said in the ages you see the word eat away to were when it came out they were calling him Jesus the Lutheran's called him Jesus the people the catholics called him Jesus but to them he was the second person it didn't matter what the name you talk about when you get it narrowed down to you see there's only one God then you will realize right the end and dark you say oh I've always seen that I won't say it again when it comes to a revelation to you that there is just one God you will know they can't be three names brother Branham said we don't baptize Jehovah Jireh jehova rapha jehova ISKCON you he said we don't baptize Lord Jesus Christ you say yeah but you shouldn't read that to me for you you're feeling me up okay fine Savior soul ain't worried about your body forget it when God reveals himself to you and I will see that just one heart you say oh yeah but but okay how come the people of this message now come and come up with a to Lourdes how come they come up with Jesus not being God till the River Jordan and then you tell me they believe in one God exceeding that's that's worth it it falls back on me as two people to think I'm just a smart aleck arrogant hateful person I'll tell you one thing for sure on Elmo smart aleck I am an arrogant hateful person I'm a mean old duty with what y'all call him granddaddy I want you to show me in the word for the trial let's don't argue philosophies kill me were that I'm off the word well you don't believe it's on so is so and so true is it in the Word of God let me ask you a simple question before we start but Ryland said that when Jesus overcame if he received in unite when I show me what right around them ever pronounced it if you ever pronouncing unite is there anywhere to message you they've been around longer as anywhere in the message that he ever said his name is Joe Jim Charlie R Melchizedek or Y always or anything if he knew that name what any pronouncing so we're looking for a name when we were to be looking for a revelation the revelation of the name is what I'm trying to find blue so then we know for a certainty that God's name is Jesus heaven declares it earth pronounced it right Gabriel from heaven brought the name mankind pronounced it baby leaped in the wound of the mother from the first time a human being announced that name or pronounced it the name of Jesus but see the only name that God ever had was Jesus I gave you that such on paragraph 187 84 of the adoption series 1960 the holy man God ever had was Jesus well now that but you need to go back before the world go go back for the world and we don't know what it is prophet went back your prophet went back before the world in the gods mind am i quoting him and told us what was back before the world and cold as God as a being sure he's a spiritual being sure God is a spirit but he is not a spirit like floating around remember what your prophet said he says he's not even omnipresent because he's a being he said in the way he only way he can be on the president is to be omniscient to know all things then he can be omnipresent but he said without that he's not omnipresent why would cause you to be just remember - you will one of these days don't own you they wouldn't come in the garden God was hunting Adam you think he didn't know where he was at what was going on might I ask you a question let's see if you believe with God's Word I thought our sins was to be put in the sea of forgetfulness you mean God can't remember him no because he said he would not he can't remember him well I'd order to leave it to where that maybe God sometimes does a little bit different the way we do or think okay this some point okay God's name is Jesus Christ hey we went through that nona 9 God ever had was Jesus so what was his name before the world Jesus he's all know that kiss Redeemer well then show me some other night serious I was a problem but now let's get through these in a hurry well let's go ahead and start reading where we had left off well how did he's the jehovah the old is jesus as a new now we know all and we went to it over and over telling himself existing Java father with his family but none of those attributes by themselves can be the name of God that's what I couldn't pronounce it but Jesus that very name is the name of Almighty God and contains ever attribute show me what attributes not included in the 90s he won't work alright let's read a little bit now so I can get through I will fidon't off cut it off on far I won't make you stay past midnight go ahead and number one let's start I want to read this one because this was basically maybe not the first time he mentioned it but it's when he connects it to his message what the message the message of grace and you know what he's talking about I looked again in the art was growing taller and taller three rainbows brother Brennan was out squirrel hunting and there he saw three rainbows going up coming out and he sit and watch him in a minute he said it was moving he said it was alive the three rainbows and watch what he comes on down see missing like a fog moving around I stood still for a few moments it was coming right out of the top of the little mountain watching every what it was it was what it was was a lot it was moving in making its motions three rainbows is what he saw right instead they're just as it was graying dawn I turned and looked again and I screamed out oh god what would you have your servant numb just then the Spirit of the Lord came in and said Jesus of the New Testament is your holy old now you know I'm to hurt you forgive me for being dirty but they don't forgive me being plain got a moonbeam flying we show we always understood he was Jesus we always understood he with God now your prophet said one day he said I used to think Jesus loved me and God hated me now he was a prophet he is honest but about you and me what about honey look what he said Jesus of the New Testament is your over the old he only changed his mass from spirit to man he was confirming of course my message of him and he loved that head he thought a lot of that experience to confirm establish strengthen settle him in the understanding of one true and living God and he said it was a confirming of his message let me know surely 31 years hasn't didn't money but he said there jeho do is Jesus of the new so that means Hebrews 13:8 is correct we women if you hold the old is Jesus is you now hold the old is differ from Jesus anew Hebrews 13:8 not in ride Hebrews 13:8 said he's the same yesterday today and forever and remember what are we going that they're just one Lord his nothing is just one alright so now let's just read a few things so go ahead and number two let your light so shine before men a lot of this he's referring back to the rainbow so he's not it's different I just cut it or he wouldn't read some it said Jesus of the New Testament if you're over the old he's just changed is available well I said studying that I find out that same word where he changes his countenance in degree did mean changing his mask not exactly his veil but his mask he come to the place he was transformed he will that means he changed his way he was God Jehovah and God Jehovah changed himself from spirit become a man he's the same Jehovah God which that was the father and this is the son being the same person and not three persons to God come on let me quote right around him he's not the second person he's not even the first person he said he is the person to see if he was the first person that would mean as other persons but when he said he is the person that solves the problem now trying to establish within our thinking the name of God is Jesus that's got to be revealed it just not Jes letters on the package we called him Jesus thought he was the second or third person of the Trinity come on be honest with yourself you know good to lie to me and say I never did believe that that's what we all come from until the Prophet brought the message go ahead number three sirs we would see Jesus saying yesterday now here was we find that the Hebrew writer is Paul saying Jesus Christ the same yesterday and you know it's residence yesterday to Denver speaking to the Hebrews and we all know that your over the Old Testament was Jesus of the new and it's the same Holy Spirit of today over the old is Jesus with you but your same Holy Spirit which is here today are you with me it's just the same God just manifested in three different offices and so the same God all that God was he poured into Christ on the cross who was he poured into the church see you can find quickly what he is the same yesterday today and forever okay okay look at number four the unveiling of God these are 1964 we noticed your holy Old Testament is Jesus of the new sea and he's the same God just changing this form now someone said the other day a Baptist minister Alan to see how can you say that Jesus and God would be the same person I said well it's pretty easy if you'll just let your own thinking get away and think the Bible terms of it they are the self same person I'm excused self plain being God is a spirit Jesus is the body that he was veiled in now see you cannot separate right there you don't separate now and you're going to say God is this in the flesh is this we've got to live since we know what happened we'll cover those things when that little baby was born but around said soul of God was in that baby Spirit of God was in that baby because that baby was Almighty God called us on then I take you back for quite a while back mister is your thing then when I was asking about the son of God and Son of Man remember the Son of God was a low gosh wage just read it over and over son of God is the low gods that came out of God in the beginning they were looking at some flesh and tries whole he's just flesh Jesus was just flash when he resurrected and ascended was not his body eternal you agree so then that body was Almighty God look it in my home to my wife I'm her husband and have a young daughter Rebecca and her father and have a grandson his name is Paul named grandfather I'm loving father and grandfather are get all these three persons we talk about a lot three persons is the same person see that's God Father Son and Holy Ghost it's just the dispensation claims God is same the same God so Joe hold yo is Jesus of the new now how about or your prophet said Paul understood - over the old was Jesus of the new but the others didn't understand it now I asked you a simple question Sunday what did Peter believe he was what it introduced him and though it was a depth of revelation that you're dealing with you then you'll finally realize a name is dealing with depth of Revelation let me glad to show you in my lymphatic die Glocke with a name of Jesus as way it spelled and then right down below it the name of Jesus are spelled again and it spelled different why what is according to what you're referring to the streets move go to the voice of the sign 1964 and notice what did Paul how the rest of them didn't have he had the abundance of the revelation of the Word of God because it was Paul who recognized that Jesus of the New Testament was Jehovah old how come he could understand he remembers reading it because he made him Paul made him these others at him they ate and fished with him hunted with him never had John called Paul saw him after he'd been glorified he saw him as two over the older Jesus of the new one because he saw a deeper revelation but what did Peter an MC to hold the old is Jesus within him rock no no they didn't see two hotels you come on they saw the revelation of one true and living God so you don't read the message to try to understand you read to try to find what's your honey how would you like for me to tell you some people that brother Branham said Billy Graham understood the supreme deity of Jesus Christ when in supreme deity when you get home you'll read it you'll find a lot of people believe but you'll find a lot of them that he named turned out to be no good he's all a while when he said Billy ground because Baptist doctrine is one God he didn't understand the fullness of the Godhead rock he didn't understand but he just understood Jesus was gone he says why say I look he's things up before I come and bring them to you look what he said he said and notice what did Paul how the rest of them didn't have he had the abundance of the revelation of the Word of God because it was Paul who recognized that Jesus of the New Testament was to hold of the over remember if Paul taught it didn't had to be a restoration who God had to come to Brenham bring him the revelation to over the oh jesus of the new because it was a restoration Paul understood it what if I understand the deeper meaning of the name is it a name you're hunting or a revelation of the being you're claiming to worship do you have to call him Jesus you're calling father you call him Holy Ghost you calling Jehovah Jireh you know enjoy it is because you're calling in Jesus you can call him Emmanuel because that's God with us we ready to try the day road runs and see that they called in cases when they call him Emmanuel well that's what they were calling you going going to the it's another message of horse of the sign that was in California this is in Beaumont Texas look mark wrote all of them but they followed Jesus and wrote what he said but Paul had the revelation of who he was what about Peter them rotten walking with him and writing what he said inventor received the new Bertha Paul comes along a few years later and receives the newer takes all of the scrolls and probably what writings they had made in anyway it varies back there there one writer I put it 30s it's on put it 50s brother riding but just get to point all goes up to Damascus and he saves a few days with some of them then he takes off to the wilderness by cell with the scrolls and he understood by revelation it's at Jehovah do as Jesus was in youth but run said he would have not called that light that he saw Lord unless he knew who it was and you see how much deeper his revelation was then unto him and he said no man taught me these times there but the Holy Ghost Peter says the man had opened the door what does he say about Paul he said Paul says things that are hard to understand he said that does something now is the share out in other words if people are not right he said they'll stumble at what he's saying paraphrasing it of what Paul was saying because they couldn't understand if either saying his revelation was so great he let him write the Bible I'll wrote the biggest portion of New Testament right like Moses are the Old Testament the great man see Moses met God he wrote Paul met God and he wrote Paul that revelation he had he knew Jesus of the New Testament was Jehovah oh he had the revelation of it watching and could place it to the Hebrews let's see now quote bread around him chapter one two three four five I believe it's right in the Hebrew series he said this is declaring the Godhead he said then now he goes in to the other things he said that was declaring the Gani that's pretty close perforating it he wrote letters notice he wrote the biggest portion of the New Testament what about don't you take Peter and all they're more the probably livid upset not one of them explained the communion no doctor spoke of it no dropp it said time it was not contained in the Word of God but Paul explained the communion till no wonder he had a greater revelation investments 1964 he was a Hebrew and I would have never worshipped anything or called anything Lord less he knowed it was bored less he knowed it was Lord and he knew as a teacher under Gamaliel that the angel of the Lord which was the logos that went out of God which was Christ that led them through the wilderness was in the form of a life a pillar of fire and when it struck him down he looked up and seen it dark he said Lord now he would have never said it never called nothing but that Lord but seeing it being a Hebrew he knowed that that was Jehovah that's the reason he had the revelation could say that Jesus of the New Testament was Jehovah the old that was his revelation because he had seen God he see me like I said the other day I want to get back to that later your prophet that you claim to follow said Scofield I was cute that's the draw one once at night Hoffman was the closest to Jesus Christ if anybody he'd ever seen well what Paul she he saw Jesus think about it because he had seen where we are hmm could say that Jesus was the old New Testament was over deal that was his revelation because he had seen Jehovah he saw him okay continue on get these out of the way then we'll do what next one number eight which is the absolute all had an experience that brought him to his decision and roll it up toward save time reading from that time on Paul knew that's Joe over the Old Testament with Jesus of the new he had something that he could hold to and that's how he could write that great book of hebrews paul saying it to more somebody got unveiled number nine the Bible said no man has seen God at any time but the only begotten of the father had to acquire him so Moses saw him veiled is a man now do we need to go what boy bringing out the other day what Moses see he said I'm can I see you he said you can't see my face so go stand in the rock I'll put my hand up he stood in the rock I believe as her sign rock he smoked when he got the water that's maybe me I don't charge you that but he stood in that rock and he walked by and he turned he looked he saw the back part of a man but around said he saw Jesus in theophany Jesus what he brought around see out in the field Jesus it was the awfully 100k Paul knew the job with the old with Jesus of the new is how he could write these things okay look let's go on so Moses saw him veiled as a man we found jovial to Jesus of the new we find the word in more faith you know what that means that God has changed this form when he changed his form of the amorphic which means that he's changed from Supernatural to natural that's what he done to come into place he just changed his mask in other words he's like a drama that he was acting out okay one more then we'll try to get into the message and look what he says this is off of the revelation of Jesus Christ here Jace book now that is the revelation Jesus Christ is God did you over the Old Testament is it Jesus anew no matter hard you try you can't prove there are three gods but it also takes a revelation by the Holy Spirit to make you understand the truth that he is one it takes a revelation to see the over the old is Jesus or the new Satan crept into the church and blind it to the people to this truth and when they were blinded to it it wasn't long until the church went to Rome all right - over the old is Jesus of the new that's who he is let's look and see what your prophet called it in the church age book that number - well he's known as the god of the truth of God of the Amen so then roll it on that you read it from the iron the church a book here is you over the Old Testament the God of the Amen here is Jesus of the New Testament the God of the Amen euro is really LORD thy God is one God there it is again you hold the Old Testament is it Jesus of the you hear o Israel the Lord our God is one God the New Testament does not reveal another God it is a further revelation of the one and same God now follow that and listen a further revelation you take Jehovah the old you're only going to get a part Revelation none but when you take your whole of the old in Jesus and you put it together you get a complete revelation notice a further revelation Christ did not come down to make himself known I love this one if you not come to reveal the son he never talked about two gods he talked about one God then where's he said on my father one I cut my father's nut and now in this life stage we have come back to the capstone revelation the most important revelation of Godhead in the whole Bible you believe it that Jesus is God he and the father are one there is one God and His name is a lot of Jesus the capstone revelation to know of his supreme deity and they quote a few down through and then we'll jump right Atmos vision brother Brendan's talking about supreme deity of the Lord Jesus he said you can't get the first base until you believe that and walk out you don't believe Joe over the old Jesus with you you would not believe the supreme deity if you don't believe the supreme deity you're all mixed up what is the supreme deity it's a revelation of Jesus Christ what is the capstone revelation go over the oldest users of the new now maybe you can understand a little bit when we quoted over and over that the disciples did not get the headstone they got to worry said His Holy Spirit he did not get the headstone because it was removed to where they could not understand it it is not just a cornerstone and it doesn't fit the headstone never did come why cause Jesus preached it in Matthew 24 when he preached six seals we're back a few weeks ago month or two ago when I was preaching about this message is the capstone this message of the seals this revelation of Jesus Christ is the capstone to the church that the Apostles never understood are you listening Peter and him understood he was over the old Jesus or the new but they couldn't put it together Paul can see it by revelation and go deeper into the depth of it and see it as a greater thing this prophet then could stand and go back into God's mind put across the mystery of God revealed and listen to him what God had in his mind he said now as in the church the revelation of Jesus Christ in the ages now face run-through they had his name one two three four lost his name in the fifth starts coming back in the sixth the name of Jesus he wasn't a name that they couldn't pronounce or something was like it was a revelation of a person that had been lost it had been lost in those dark ages that Jesus was Almighty God they brought him out as a Trinitarian concept or a team of God which meant that Jesus was a lesser God a demon God would never leaving that was trying to prove it not see in Council that Jesus was a lesser God that was the first nursery in council with Luke would you come back into the field church age he talks about a white stone to be given in a new name written which no man knows as he himself asked ever individual ever individual ever overcomer east message to each age holds out an incentive to the believer encouraging him to be an overcomer and die by be rewarded of the Lord in this stage the Spirit is promising hidden manna and a new name written in a white stone it's 208 Pergamon church age did he going this is to say to eleven Pergamon surgeon he says here that he's going to give the overcomer

world he knows the name but we do not one day had his good pleasure we will know all Shaw we're gonna get a new name it's not an odd part in the Bible because Abraham was Abram was chained to Abraham say rather say rah Saul to Paul Peter you know Simon to Peter anything that's relating to us then come up with a new name but look it's in a white stone it says in the Bible we read it a new night he alone knows so now there's no way that Wade can tell me my new night we're gonna see in a minute if desire could be that we're going to see that it might be after the world for we know a lot of times but we're Christians will have a certainty receiving unite but it could be very the name that you were written on the Lamb's Book of Life for the foundation of the world it's a wonderful talk you know

of one crying in the wilderness they put him right in the scripture but a random said I'm not the angel of the Lord he said I'm his messenger we said here's what's going to happen when this man comes and he turned around and right there it was taking place right you have never thought I know you how the random would say it like this he said look at her he said never have we have down to any of the

of the City of God in God's new name is the revelation that was given to this church in this age that's a six church a what about it going to the next one not tiring church age when Jesus overcame his name was changed and he would reveal that name he that would be with him overcome as he has he received a new name and I'll reveal my new name to him remember back over what ago was talking we did a new night could be the name was before the foundation water he said and I'll give him my good night so you never over comer I mean among such as that them leaders and so forth now all the children of Israel didn't get there nine chains of course that's right but those high leaders when they overcome had received a new night remember its to him go ahead to the next twenty three after Jesus overcame overcome he received a new night himself ever overcome her not ever overcome the church when it's completely overcome the revelation of again begins to be real to them so we're going out to wait from some mountains of the full overcoming remember we're still overcoming when Jesus what about this one go ahead to twenty five and I'll write my new name upon him my new name when all becomes new then he will take upon him a new name and that name will be the name of the bride also remember you're still miss Jesus now you better hold on to that part until all becomes new then whatever his name is is your name that write the name of the bride all show what that name is nun dark-hunter which means you try to figure it out prop it up do it you look it up and try to do this try to figure it out none dark injector that's the same word as conjunct I mean it would have to be a revelation of the Spirit given so conclusively that none would dare denied when no doubt he will leave that revelation to the day when he desires to give that name suffice it to know that it will be more wonderful than he could ever you know one could ever imagine well don't you think brother Dale and what you've been doing tonight has been that word conjectures just look it up it's trying to figure it out don't you think - not you've been trying to figure out something I had named design yet tell a name when I am down the cubes meal you can accuse me at one time for 50 years I've had these dollars maybe not a few calls again cause the computer I've also had this one what is the name go ahead to 26 places an answer is on the seals what is the name of the that will be on the people of Revelation Street well the revelation 3:12 it says the name of the city among God's name in my new name what is the name I'll that will be on the people of Revelations Trent well I don't know yeah he said give them a new name I don't know what it is this is questions and answers on the seals it would probably be problem probably may know when we get there I don't know what it is now so he didn't know the new night yet he's preaching so let's drop back in the seal book and get one quote just what everybody wants go ahead we're going to get done in a hurry tonight we didn't pretty good this is from the first seal I regret 283 in Jesus his name on earth was Redeemer Jesus when he was on earth he was a redeemer that's true but when he conquered death and hell and overcame them and ascended on high he received in uniting that's the reason they holler the way they do and don't get nothing it'll be revealed in the Thunder you notice the mystery is coming riding there's got to be something it changed this church it will be revealed in the thunders questions and answers in 64 number twenty-eight Glen now the seven thunders which equals seven mysteries already been revealed that's an argument now where the thunders has been revealed or the shield has even been revealed that's an argument in the message you read what he says how the seven thunders which equals seven mysteries already been revealed were they revealed in the seven seals but are yet but are yet not known unto us as the thunders yet no they were revealed in the seven seals that's what the thunders was about they was revealed the thunders was the revelation contained in the seven seals one more now let's find the symbols first he'll find out what the thunder means that's perfectly we know that the thunder was the voice of God when they're sealed open so well he said be revealed in the seals be revealed in the thunders how the thunder sounded as the sealed open that's the argument of the people of the message now they're arguing like crazy split all the way one group says the seal they broke it the other group says they're broke the words our concern about the thunder the Syst under would be the voice of God to tell you what to seal is but he said if it ain't right going 152 when you look through 155 158 is a syllable and see if he ain't telling you the Thunder she was a god when the seal breaks well the point is to see how the seals broke was the thunder the voice of God those seals and if it was revealed to the Prophet and then when it's revealed to you and I and the thunders reports of God the thunders don't sound in heaven quoting him they say I'll know her well because the Prophet stood here told us what them seven thunders were the revelations contained in the seven seals are we looking for a new name that's the only statement I wanna make are we looking for a new name some kind of a secret worded name or some or some kind of a something they've called him Melchizedek they called it every night they said when he was let's see one group said when he was dying that the new name of Jesus my message forgive me the new day of Jesus when he when he was dying on the cross he spoke he said Eli a life that's in there what it was my god my god why is that person they said that was a new night he died speaking in come well all right this is my statement until whatever God has planned is finished with a little Bride of Christ let's hold on to the name of Jesus and don't try to find something else because you would be conjuring it up you know kind of figure it out so leave it alone didn't we make no but what if it's made known as he said about the three twelve may be known may know when we get time and see that's where people don't follow the Prophet he never put a new name under the Seventh Seal I'm excusing the seven churches it's under the six churches and under the six year change one or the name of Jesus was to be restored opened over so it is a new name of Jesus is it some other name we're looking for are we looking for a different deeper meaning to the night what Apollo how did the other didn't have a deeper meaning of the night when he brought around him how that Paulding out a deeper meaning of the name not trying to find a new name we try to find a meaning for the hour that we're living and yours the inner statement of a Christ a mixture of God reveal the bride is part of the mystery the threefold revelation on God was reported to Christ on Chrysler jerk take her back to the garden the Prophet said the Godhead is not complete without you he said in the bride would be the fullness of the Godhead bodily let's just worry about using look maybe it's a better where I don't know what to say you don't want to say doing away with the nine code is not going to be doing away with the night it's the acts of a play the bride is part of it if you've ever studied the master especially the seals it's the actual play but around says where did this one come in revelations five he said he was back behind the throne making intercession he said he walks forth read revelation 4 time to throne revelation 5:9 one sitting on the throne see he comes forward climbed up on the throne and shuts down and said I'm the one that done it until out - tonight don't be worried about it you have a brother so-and-so said he had his new name well then we know he's not right so if somebody comes alone and said God's revealed my new name and then he's all revealed his new Knight he said well you're out start with because you can't tell me what your name is so you can't tell me than you know I'm planning I'm blowing what is that true he said what do you mean I mean a deeper revelation for the word of God that started in Genesis to unfold when he said let us make man in our own image that man is wade was covering his a spirit man he's a theophany he's God in another form ever born-again believer there ever will be is in Genesis 1:26 and 27 28 tells them to multiply and replenish what I spiritual that spiritual supposed to be so what I thought was supposed to be doing I thought preaching of the gospel was the sowing of the seed the home I thought by you sisters going out and testifying to the neighbors that you were sowing the seed of God why can't you see it that simple it's just keep on going it rose that way you're going to work for 50 years I've been going like this so I don't think I'm gonna quit now I'll come very close many many many times cuz just sit down and say you don't have it Otis drove me crazy everything in the book it won't drive me to the place because my off quote the prophet one quote I got in there he says there is no way the enemy will ever take away from the bride of Jesus Christ the supreme deity of Jesus Christ is that scriptural upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell can't prevail against it so we're standing on the rock come on brother hey with 20 minutes till 9:00 I thought we'd be later to a board to give me a little extra you got any questions well they're coming up two musicians come on you you got any questions sister little minute without together like she got when a prophet come seek it's not all inertia got it okay when a prophet comes he comes to the whole population of an area right I mean he'd come to the to the lost and the ones that would receive his message so when you say your prophet said it's to people who don't believe all that he's a prophet would say and in that by turning that down they've turned the word down right okay Stefon shoes you mean you turn it down he's our prophet too right did we turn it down yeah but now brother Dylan is my question okay see I'm not worried because I've been standing this away for 50 years declaring let's keep on trying to understand the name of Jesus and may I say it this way and not be sarcastic if you had never heard the Prophet if I had never heard the Prophet where would we ever have anything about knowing the name of God is Jesus and then they saying what about Lilith if for 50 years I hadn't hammered it about his name being Jesus or do you get it into words what are they preaching it language it always be a great revelation we're up above that with it they don't even talk about the name of Jesus no more a great thing but about it listen just remember what I'm saying it's a furthermore the revelation of Jesus Christ that I'm interested in and when that finishes it then he can become proclaim and unite and very easily be when we get there that's our self interpretation no that's a statement you make your why can't I make mine I don't please I've had people look at me like I don't believe that I said that's your statement it is knew a thing or what I would see we're not arguing statements we're talking about Jesus Christ well Gottman 250 once parable thereby knows at them the mighty God is Jesus the Prince of Peace is he everlasting father the King eternally the winning of all wisdom of all things are made the whole life we were a nation jesus was explained what if we were to message that will change on us all the Godhead and is all in him what have we actually heard the message this song if you say we have a sense then you're looking for another prophet when you love with I know the story I know what a big portion of people this makes me do it they looking for brother Branham to come back and he's gonna tell us these times praise God he never said a word about that except one day he can be here with us for 30 40 days after the resurrection and he can bring us the truth of thanks but he won't bring this Redemption because Redemption will be over when the resurrection comes Redemption over to the Gentiles what if it could be then he Jesus Redeemer on earth before the world he was Jesus the I am [Music] not trying to interpret I just ain't run out yet preaching about Jesus so we keep on preaching to my Jesus it leaves me getting saved the field then what type slicin are what about it might have a need oh it's all in the Godhead is all in it's all in it's all in the money goddess and it's all in bodyguard achieve Lord and that's all that should be desired every one of us we should all desire not to argue and fuss about money but the desire is in Jesus seeing standing among us see him as the alive the Word of God [Music] so amen anybody else oh what a great day I need it does Oh God reveal yourself to me here is when I go other our brothers got fluid developing on his elbows if edit drain is undone but we condemn it under the name of the god that we preach it an ID the name of Jesus father just reach down and touch our brother and take away this problem with the fluid engine system anybody else Jesus the name of God is his name it's all in it's off you dismiss pray one for another father we thank you for the night we just commit everything to your all in your ninety God is Jesus and it's all in the Alpha and Omega beginning and in the living word incarnate [Music]
