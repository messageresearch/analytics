over at brother burle's Camp by the will of the Lord we've done it this will be the third year third year and we've got a few uh contributors but we need some more we're not going to need as much this year but we're still going to need some uh funds to buy the uh to buy the food uh they're expecting a few more people than last year which would be close to 160 people uh children that for the camp and I think we kind of already got the crew together some of the ones that went last year never want to return but some of the ones that went last year no names but the ones that had fun they'll be back so we had fun last year and year before last two if anybody else wants to volunteer or if anybody wants to stay there's um we've got a A list of the uh there's days in in Simpsonville South Carolina that's not too far away if anybody wants to go and participate there will not be a Thursday this year it'll just be Friday afternoon Saturday and Sunday so we won't have to cook as much but we're still going to need to cook um Friday afternoon all day Saturday and Sunday today so if you would if you want to uh do it like we did last year I think we give them you give the money to Sister Lisa and run it through the church if you wish or just some of you have already just handed cash or written a check so you can take it off on your taxes whatever just give it to Sister Leisa and she keep up with it and we'll uh uh we'll buy all the food we're uh we're being Frugal with your money I know I think you all know that we we don't try to uh have steak and lobster every night but we do try to give the kids a good meal to eat and sister Gwen and and sister June and and brother Joe and I really get into to doing the uh the menu I really enjoy that and and then we get help from others and new recipes and some things Gwen likes to do is kind of weird so we don't do them but she they're big help and brother Joe and sister Glen really helped us a lot and and sister joy and Danny I'm not going to forget them I in my notes so but all that's helped we really appreciate it but we're trying to get together now it's July the 29th 30th and the 31st so we'll be leaving on that Friday morning Lord willing with the food so we need to go ahead and start Gathering it up if you got anything you can give us we surely would appreciate it and like I said um it's something we like to do every year as a church not out of the church funds but as a people and uh as a church group you've always done uh exceedingly abundantly we've never had to ask for anything else uh We've maybe have 10 or $15 left over so the Lord's really done well you know we kind of uh leave some stuff over for next year and we have some stuff left from last year uh that we use this year which is uh we don't use it for anything else but for the camp so it's from you the Spoken Word Church people uh it comes from you and the people there really appreci app because without it when they first got started without it they would not have enough money to even have the camp they couldn't afford to pay the the total amount so we pitched in and and provided the food and provided the labor so thank you all of you that labor with us and the ones that labor getting your billfold out of your pocket we thank you too so Lord bless you yes same place same place same place yeah amen we're going to try number 49 I

house of the Lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn back where we've been reading in Ephesians 1 and we will read from Romans 8 now remember the Lord willing this coming Wednesday brother pach will be with us preaching and then this coming Sunday brother uh Richard Douglas will be preaching for us so remember these two and remember to pray for the sisters they're leaving as me immediately as quick as I can get through they're going to head out towards hon fors for a little time together and then remember to all the brothers that we're going fishing the Lord willing Thursday Friday and Saturday and uh you know throughout fishing so if you want to come along just let us know and we'll try to be do and you know and getting everything ready remember too now that the 40 year 40th year anniversary will be coming up July the 2nd and 3rd so remember that and brother Keith Reed will be here with us preaching for the weekend so remember these things and just you know let's see any other announcements I think that's covered everything all right the man yeah just you know you brothers that are going meet after the services and uh that way your wiv will be gone so you have a little time we can sit down and and talk and uh you know and that way we we can discuss what we're going to do so remember that amen I made the statement this morning I put it on early on the message but a lot of people you know they they think that you just make a statement but you know what I said about the prophet and what he said this is off of the stature of perfect man preached in 1962 10:14 the morning service uh he says talking about the uh Catholic church and they how they doing and see how the this deceit what they're trying to do give money away to buy why they're trying to break it and they're doing it and she's broke and what is it on the gold stand it's on the gold standard and the Catholic Church the hierarchy owns the gold of the world someone says $168 billion well brother Joe ran it up just a moment ago and a 1994 audit that they listed 479 billion in stocks 410 billion in cash 479 billion in stocks and bonds 29 billion in gold and 470 billion in fixed assets like investments in real estate so that's how much more they've gain since even they were talking back there but here's what I was a statement I was making see and they the Catholic Church they own the gold of the world there they are throw her right back on the gold standard and you people just keep your homes and things but you belong to the Catholic church I just wanted to put that on brother Joe run it off for me you know I know there is plenty of things that people can say and brother Joe ran off another one for we're not to be around here when all of these things are made into finality we agree cuz we're not going through the tribulation that's not what we're talking about right but you know the uh the prophet said it so we're not looking forward to it we just know what will take place cuz we're sitting right now if they had demanded payment from Russia when they demanded payment from Russia if they demanded our payment we would have been busted right then and that would have been it but it couldn't happened because see we are the image to the Beast so we're the only people in the world that can control the rest of the world with our Firepower and you know planes and things so we're being able to be protected for a while but don't worry about that is coming too but who's worried see I'm not concerned I'm concerned with getting into word getting ready to get out of here because before the Antichrist comes in in full swing the man of sin the prophet said we would get out of here all right you know so we're doing that all right Ephesians 1 and Romans 8 father we thank you and we ask you to just help us now and give understanding unto us Lord we see the day and the hour that we're living upon the natural out here in the land and all the things that are taking place but we know and realize that in reality form that all of that is just to to be a a thing for life but we care not for life we care for eternal life we ask you now that you would just guide us as we read your word and speak on you you come on the scene and talk to our hearts forgive our sins and lead us Lord you promised it in your word that you'd come Among Us and heal our sick and Deliver us because it is your word we thank you in Jesus name amen I'm not looking forward to being shut up I'm looking forward to going up but the prophet said they would be concentration camps up in Alaska and things for us so the bride would be physically bereth all right see all right that's not that's just saying what he say amen you say well a bride's not going to go through these things well you know I hope not that's I'm just like that the the man there the Bible when it come up you know and said you know they talking about this that and the other you know and he said well you know uh I think we'll just be down there two years I'm sure that Prophet looked at him and said amen I hope so but God ain't spoke to me well they was down there their 70 so that was it okay let's read the word and it's going blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will let's just stop there and go over to Romans now and we'll go over about to n 19 th verse because we're going to try to pick up a point and move on this afternoon a little Romans 8:19 for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject unto vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in t together until now and not only they but ourselves also are you groaning that's right Amen to be changed that's right all right and not only they but ourselves also which are the first fruit fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to it the Redemption of our body you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now not to back up but just for in case somebody own the internet systems and all tapes pick these up we try to say a few words of background to where that you'll know what we're talking about and maybe stir interest in uh going backward and listening to the messages we're talking about adoption in three stages all right not uh three different things it's not that way it's the pre stages just like justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost father son Holy Ghost it's all saying and showing that that you know it's all this continual working of the Holy Spirit the revealing of his word and all and not something different not one thing being one thing another being another different up and down you know uh I just that's I'm just plain of what I say it's just like the prophet when he was uh the first second and third pull we can follow the first pool is fishing second pull is fishing the third pool is is what is it deer hunting or something I mean it's uh I thought it was all fishing you know so winding and and the opening go of God's word that's just you know the best I can say it it doesn't change and make it different but we have been talking about as I said adoption in three stages what stage one is the new birth because we must be bought brought into the body of Christ by the new birth all right then the second stage is the adop The Authority or the amount of transfiguration in comparison to the Lord Jesus Christ and his journey and then we went through those now for 13 sermons okay bringing you up to that place today we want to try to move into the third stage of adoption which is the Redemption of the body and that's what we're going to be talking about and as One True Believer in the message of the hour and the Bible I I believe in a change of this body that's right I don't believe in getting a new one I believe it's this body is going to be made new why would I live in this for 71 years and then lay it down and get me another one and what would I look like I mean when we get to heav are we all going to be the same size you know then God's not a god of variety that's right you know he just wouldn't I don't I just don't see that I'm not making a joke right and it's making a truth out of it all right and we'll get to it into the message when we get there of studying it brother randam said that we in this body see and and Paul says it we groan that's right why would be groaning in this body and then get another one I know that's a denominational Doctrine now that's held on and it's in the message of the hour of people that are really very popular to preach you know and things and got big followings but they believe that we're going to get a new body yeah and I listened to the man or I wouldn't say it but I was listening to him and and the best I could get out of it was that something happens and we get some kind of a change and we step into some kind of a of a theophany form and then we float around through that and go through life through the through the out on the ashes and the Millennium and we we walk out on the top of our own bodies cuz they're in the earth and and then after somewhere back in the future home we connect back well I don't uh I don't understand that's right I didn't understand it when I heard it but right you know I did listen and I don't say things that I can't you know say I did listen to people to try to explain cuz I do you know cuz I want to know amen that's one thing for sure I want to know that's my whole point amen that's the reason I tell people what I believe right you know most people never tell you what to believe right and I tell you what I believe cuz it's one of two things if I'm wrong you can correct me if I'm right we wouldn't worry about you see everything will be okie dokie but now listen so then we're talking about in three stages and we're coming now to the point of talking about the Redemption of the body all right now I want to make myself plain of what I believe okay now I I always say I never I don't even ask my wife my kids to believe what I believe I preach the gospel if they want to believe it that's up to them cuz I can't make a believe it amen I'm not looking my my thoughts is not on the change of the body you remember years ago how long's that been 30 years ago maybe some of you've been around about 30 years ago might even been close to 40 I said I'll quit trying to go to heaven cuz I realized that the Bible wasn't speaking of that the Bible was speaking about heaven coming here you know here's where I'm going to get eternal life here's where I'm going to be changed in a moment of 29 here's where I'm going to finally come back and live not in this sinful condition no washed off and made a a Utopia uh you know all right but see then I I quit trying to want to go that way I'm want to see about trying to get it here well I'm not talking about see that we come down to the change of the body I can show you where brother R said sure in this seal book that he said uh and he using that scripture groaning for waiting the Redemption of the body he said that'll take place in the first resurrection right y see now we know where that'll finally climax right but my concern is to get what the scripture is talking about right the scripture here in Romans is not talking about the change of the body in reference in the 23rd verse it says and we not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption all right waiting for the adoption to Wi the Redemption of our body all right now what does to wit mean I know you you as witty people smart you know intelligent but still it comes out to the same word right go back to Webster run it down check it out when you say that he's a witty person or to wit see it will still come back to meaning a knowledge cuz see a person who is witty is very knowledgeable right right you know all right so it comes back to the same word as to whip to understand right all right to understand the Redemption of the body that's right if we don't understand the Redemption of the body there won't be a change of this body we will go by the grave and have to come up because of somebody that did get an understand understanding to to to Wi to understand see and I know and realiz and I'm talking to school teachers and things that sitting here so then here's a nth grade education God telling you what a word means I don't have to tell you what it means I just remind you what the Bible's saying about it right to Wi to understand about the Redemption of the body now I'm not going to cover a lot in that this afternoon okay so I'm going to go so far into it and then I'll back out and then I'll wait till the next message because I love to do that because I leave you dangling thinking about it all right and give you time to study it over and think it over right so you go home and do it and I would invite you to please do this within the next week or so listen to our read about 14 times the future home and then when you get through with that go to things that are to be and you you know you'll get the whole do it but now watch to wh now back in the Old Testament it appears in a word there to Wi in Genesis 24 and 21 that is when uh elaser is coming to Rebecca and she tells him I will water your camels and and things you know and all of that and it says to Wi he was wondering there if because that's what he had asked you remember he had asked God kind of a fleece like yep that you know to find the right one let things happen a certain way and he goes on with the fleece to to see if she would you know water the camels and do the things and all and see he was wanting he he he was dealing in his understanding that he was here for a reason and being there for a reason Lord I want understanding is this the right person see so it appears into two wi and it gives you which is a definition of 30 3045 in the Old Testament now it means to know or to understand it means to be made known or to declare the word wi the all right see it's it's it's a word to signifying knowledge of something something and like I said even if it's signifying to where you would read the definition of a witty person it would still mean a knowledgeable person right see because they're they wouldn't be witty if they would knowledge but now that's not always educational form of knowledge that's witty is a different thing all right you come over into the New Testament and you find it used to wit of the grace of God in second Corinthians 8 And1 all right that definition is from 11:07 in Strong's Concordance it means to make known to declare to certify give to understand or be recognized the word to it okay now in second Corinthians 5:9 where it says to it that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself you'll find it's the number 5613 which gives you like this when in other words to to or when that God was made reconciled in ch or how that God was made you know right in Christ uh or as it were as it were that God was made manifest in Christ see and all of it's coming down to an understanding all right now to read it from the original Greek straight into the uh English language it says this this but also ourselves the first fruits of the spirit having and we ourselves in ourselves grown a sunship looking for the Redemption of the body all right now that's the original translation you know right into the English all right I like to give you these because I like to read it I've got this book you know that a brother gave me brother Phil km years ago and it's called 26 translations of the Bible and it's it's not this thick now so it's not 26 translation it only shows where the different variations if somebody differs a word or two they'll put it in there see if not then they just give you the same definition all right you've heard brother R speak of the ls of translation and he says that it was perfect in text and content all right the lungs of translation it says not only this but ourselves also who have the first fruits of the spirit even when grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption that is the Salvation of our bodies now these are all giving you the two- wit the Redemption of our body from Romans uh 8:23 WJ cornbury these are other Bibles says longing for the adoption that shall Ransom our body from its bondage the 20th century version of the New Testament right says while we eagerly await our full adoption as Sons the Redemption of our bodies way mouth in his translation says as we wait for full sunship in the Redemption of our bodies the new Berkeley translation new Berkeley version says as we await that ride of sunship that involves our bodily Redemption see I'm I'm getting a point to where that you you'll get back to it later on all right JB Phillips says while we wait for the Redemption of our bodies which will mean that at last we have realized our full sunship in him that's it all right now see then Paul is saying that we are groaning whenin ourselves y that's right it's not somewhere else so this is not an outward thing it's not something somewhere there this is within us amen and the only way let's see um it's in the seal book uh the prophet said the only way you can grown is for New Life to have come in I believe it's 79 I believe it's right of the SE B new life to have come in would make us to where we could Gran and see we wouldn't bu no groaning we would only be like nature nature is groaning I'll read you a quote in a little while where brother R said that they can't do that right nature can't grown Like We Grown no they are groaning because they're wanting to be delivered you know the trees they're there won't be any crooked trees in the future home there won't be any uh you know uh uh things that are wrong it's all going to be perfect all right so then but the whole creation or creation is now waiting see for someone to understand all right now I emphasize again and then I'll break away from it that the groaning within us is a desire that's right amen that's been created within us because of the new birth all right and that desire that we have is to come to a place to where that there there is no more pain and Agony or or troubles or heartaches or whatever you know right all right and and that's what we're longing for and you know and like I said now but we can look at it and say well that's over there at the resurrection yeah well if there's no groaning now there's not a resurrection for us am if new life hasn't come in then there's no way of us groaning for for something to do we just like the world is like everything else now here's my point so we get started now all right see we're just not we're not waiting I'm not talking about tonight I mean this afternoon and won't for the next message or maybe uh I'm not talking about something that I'm wanting to be changed he said well boy I'd love to be you know now see you're not listening to my point I don't I don't believe if we I believe if we don't get this right now right right that's right that we will still be groaning but we're going to the ground somebody's going to come to a place well why can't we claim we're going to come to that place and forget it and just let it go see but at this present time I'm not concerned with being changed right I'm concerned with the Revelation to be revealed to me all right now to be healed how do you receive your healing you accept it by faith you say God thank you for my healings Etc we'll get to this in a minute you'll see it but you say Thank You Lord and then he reveals to you amen that you're healed amen right and sometimes it's quite a while before it's delivered right you understand me Abraham believed God but it's 25 years right right before he got we'll say 20 for something you know right for he got to the place of getting a change of the body that's right see and he didn't really realize that that he was going to have to go through a change to be able to get an Isaac right cuz he got an ish without a change that was his problem right but see we're looking at something as to try to bring it to a complete end of something instead of looking at God trying to to bring his word and reveal that word word to where that you and I can can stand here right and say I'm redeemed I mean somebody's going to have to do that I said it's like your healing right you say by Stripes I'm Healed all right and you may have to do that for a while but then one day God says you're healed well thank you you tell everybody I'm Healed well well you're still sick you still taking medicine yeah M your around but ain't got nothing to do with it cuz God told me I was healed see and when you get it that away you don't have to worry about it like I told you that doctor said I'll take your kneecap off I life said you won't take my kneecaps off I still got them oh devil heard that once a while he said see there yeah that's been about 25 to 30 years ago you know and all of that but still now watch see the world is waiting for somebody to come to a place that's right that God can speak to them and tell them what's going on and tell them about the word of the hour that we're living all right see waiting on the end time bride to receive the revelation of the Redemption of the body right all right now everybody follow me see I'm not talking about the Redemption of the body that's right that's a change on twinkle an eye that's a that's an easy process that's a a thing that will happen but it only happen because new life has come in here that's right all right so now we try to pick up and and we'll go with it all right so now the prophet said on future home and you can read these as we go along I'll probably scan read them to try to save time cuz anybody order know them that page 49 of the future home that we are a part of this Earth our body that's right your soul is a part of God an attribute of God displayed here on Earth in a body the body is to be redeemed now the Soul's redeemed because it was in sin so God came down by process of justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and redeemed your soul and you see you this out here being part of the earth it's Redeemed by it now how are we Redeemed by it what by by what justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost redeems the soul amen all right now we'll get into the future home if you'll read that we'll get into it and try to preach about it some that you'll see it it's going through the same process but he said it's Redeemed by it you're in the process now it's growing on that's what I like see something growing and we ain't just laying around half well one of these day well you know where we're fine boy the bus is going to pull up you know well like I was trying to say this morning don't be down at that railroad station in Gainesville waiting on the bus cuz it don't go there they've got a bus depot you get in the wrong place you're not supposed to have no problems you know and all but we do we get get in trouble like but now listen in the Redemption of the Soul all right now watch this then we just step over the body and then we'll go back and move a little in the Redemption of the Soul or the person the being whatever you want to call it we must go through what to make a new birth justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost makes the new birth all right any of those things apart from the other it doesn't work so it's a unit of bringing us to Salvation now in doing that then we come to a state of sanctification okay now remember I'm just hitting the edge of what I want to bring but it is the edge of the revelation of the Redemption of the body right because in Salvation sanctification means cleansed and set aside for service all right the prophet says you go out in the yard you pick up a g yep you've got a reason for that GL that's justification y he said then you don't put it in use he said you take it in the house you wash it you scour it out you cleanse it real good he said that's sanctification righten he said now it's not in service yet he said it's you just got it ready right y all right so what happened when the sanctification came into the the individual is actually it cleansed and claimed that area see call the soul now I know you can argue soul is this and soul is that no soul here going keep going but see it cleanses or cleans it right the just as you read in the future home that when when the blood the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ was dropped out on this Earth at Calvary thank cleansed or claimed this earth right all right see so now we're in the message so I'm encouraging you to read the message of the future home before I preach on it okay okay all right but see it's to set aside to sanctify something you set that vessel aside see yep now I gave you two or three quotes on that so you just go ahead and read but see you come down to word that you must receive then page 17 of the future home which is number four of your notes you come to a place then that what are you talking about that he's brought the church through justification he called it through sanctification then filled it with the Holy Ghost and Fire all right now let me get over here and give you that scripture uh Matthew 3:11 we speaking of the Holy Ghost and Fire all right now so there's more to it than just setting something aside right you must come to the position or place for it to be filled right with the Holy Ghost that's right and fire right now see I know a lot of you Pentecostals talked about the the Holy Ghost and Fire and things that's all right that's that's their business but that fire even that sanctification if you look down page 23 of the future home and he says the Holy Ghost he sent down sanctification then sent the Holy Ghost in Fire and burnt the sin out of him and dwelt inside amen all right now even at justification you find the future home that everything's not just right it just chops off your past sins then that San ification you'll find that it cleanse or sets aside the person and claims that person all right the soul of the individual right but it's still then it's it's not right okay see you get new desires you get new thoughts you get new ways you want to go to church everything's wonderful you're doing better but still you need the Holy Ghost and Fire right all right see now the reason you need the Holy Ghost and Fire see the fire will burn out anything that's left of you that didn't leave out its sanctification you say well it's cleanse and set aside well that's true you can cleanse a vessel to a certain degree but there are certain germs Etc and things that can will not leave out so there is parts of us that we still have troubles we get Sanctified we come to church they said we want to do right we want to live right everything's fine but if we don't have that Holy Ghost inside of us we're not a child of God that's right but we need something to burn out everything that's right to die to ourselves and burn out what's left see cuz sanctification is really a dangerous stage your Prophet explains it he said it even it's like this he said uh you'll go to church and he said if you ain't careful he said there'll be seven demons come back and take their place in there and you're living a good Sanctified life going to church Glory Hallelujah I'm in the message believe everything the prophet said and what is it yeah right seven times worse than it was to start with because he said he makes you a religious demon right amen that's what comes in there as religious things all right taking the place where before you was a drunk and you know all the world a dop addict or a peel head or something and you won't dare do that anymore no no no see cuz you come become religious right but see then you need something to come in and burn that out that's right and remember at sanctification is where the seed is planted right your Prophet says you're begotten at sanctification we'll go back through some of these things he said you're begotten he said like a baby into the wound a baby into the wound is not a baby outside working be called a baby it's a baby in the wound right right that's right see we need more than to just say well I believe God right and he cleansed me he took away my smoking my drinking my gambling my this my adulteries my he took all of that away wonderful thank the Lord so can alcoholics synonymous do a lot of good for you all not putting them in no category with Christianity no just telling it like it is amen all right but still we need something to take place so it's the Holy Ghost and Fire that's right see that fire comes down and burns out all of that just left of use sister Gil cuz there's a lot of us left and see we really need a lot of Holy Ghost and Fire now cuz there's a lot a lot of us left it not to we go out right that's right but we're not on that we're we're laying a foundation for something all right but see one day this world yep will go through a baptism but it's after the Millennium it's just a burning over before the Millennium Armageddon is just a temporarily burning over right all right but then you go through the Millennium and then you come out and they'll have to be a burning amen of everything all right we're not into that we're just laying a little foundation with it but see but you can receive that all right and it makes a way getting you ready all right the world is redeemed the same way as the individual is redeemed all right now let's drop back out of that now because if I precede any further I got to preach the message on to what I'm looking at and I don't want to do it I want to I want this in your mind I want one thing in your mind the biggest portion of the world is systems en counting the ones of this message and I won't call names but a lot of you know the names they believe we're going to get a new body in this message after all the prophet has said and thing and they'll quote you to death about it right and they believe you're going to get you a new body right see I don't know of any organized religion now I'm saying I don't know now okay they never taught anything other than getting a new body right right now if you know about it I'd like to know because I don't know of any other church I don't know of any church that ever talked getting this body redeemed right they thought we're going to get a new body and my just plan old reasons of looking at it is is you know sometimes you just don't think God is good enough or great enough to powerful enough to be able to do that so he just going to make us a new one he's just going to speak one of these days we're going to come out of the Dust of the earth and you know and all of that but you know you won't be you that's right where you going to get it from now I've express my points on these things for many years he brother randam even said that Jesus's body come out of this Earth wholeheartedly agree but did he come out of this dirty stinking rotten stuff that's dirty now no just simple question no it came from the original creation amen abely amen that's the way I like to look at see in the original creation there was no sin right back before this world when it was created and it come from things that was not God spoke it into existence and it was wonderful Perfect Right amen not Eternal because he didn't create the world Eternal that's right see but it's perfect cuz God can't create anything imperfect he didn't create the devil imperfect he created imperfect and let him have his own way and he went imperfect now so then the world see was perfect sin is what's perverted it so when when the body of Jesus Christ came in Hebrews 10:5 a body thou Hast prepared me he simply went back to the same elements that he created this world from and just brought it right into existence you say but that wouldn't be the same body of the world why not right where did Adam come from right did God scoop up dirt and this potx petro and things make body you know for Adam or did he just speak the prophet said one day God will speak and he said we won't have to come forth like man thinks he said we'll just he'll just speak and that body will come right out of the earth I've gave you the illustration over a thousands of times that you know the prophet said it's not necessarily the same gases right right why why were you making that statement I told you why an Africa in Africa you're in Africa and a line grabs you and he kills you and he eats some of you and they grab the line with a net and they throw him in a boat and turn him down to a ship and Flame and they get him to America about half a day later and out goes the bathroom guy you know and that's part of you part of you is in Africa part of you is in America no problem with me right right cuz 16 elements is 16 elements that's right he don't have to go over and dig a hole it won't be a hole where Paul's at a Hool in the ground I don't know where you've ever if you ever been out where you took a bulldozer and pushed up ground you can tell in a hurry whether there's anybody ever been buried there or not right sure any of you ever been there and seen that happen right it don't look the same you'll have a red clay Bank you can cut that bank off straight as can be and you'll have a red clay bank right in the middle of it you'll have a round circular length of that body that doesn't look like the rest of it you can tell in a hurry whether or not it's start see but what am I getting at I'm getting one point our bodies came out of this Earth y from Mom and Daddy Jesus's body came by the spoken word all right so he will speak again one day and we will come forth I agree we know that all right amen but I'm not concerned about that part I'm concerned about something just a little bit prior to them which where we are right now now we're going to get down to some things it's we're going to talk about something it's your Propet kept emphasizing but people don't want to emphasize it anymore maybe but he says Christianity is based upon Resurrection not replacement AB Resurrection that's right so Christianity is based now I gave you some quotes down through there about three of each one and that's what I try to give the Christianity is based on Resurrection yep m not replacement right right it's on the message number eight on you notes questions and answers in Hebrews part 2 5712 Christianity is based upon Resurrection not replacement Resurrection the same Jesus went down the same Jesus come back that's right if you go down redheaded you come back redheaded if you go down blackheaded you come back blackheaded see it's a resurrection now a lot of us may go down grayheadedgamer for sure you ain't lost any hirs you heard that right they're there waiting on us it's going to come back all right then Christianity is based upon Resurrection not replacement the same Jesus that went down is the same Jesus that come back and according to the scriptures he had then nailed the prince in his hands um I wrote it all the way through my notes and done got off all my notes okay John 20 I guess it's John 20 26 and 27 that Jesus said put your hands in to my side put your fingers in other words into my he was standing there with a body that's right that had nail prints and hold in his side oh of course I know great great understanding of Supernatural Revelation Brother D you don't understand that it was changed after the end well I don't like him changed after the end right right that's what I said I don't like where brother R may come along they said but but he changed later no you know what he said on the future home to that's twice I'm pretty sure but he said I know it his first one he said I've taught three processes from a boy that's right and you know what people are saying now this not justification sanctification baptism of it's just the Holy Ghost yeah that's right but I'm just going to stay what he says now that's that's just my point because that way I can see how it lines up all right watch him where he gets down to the uh yeah the next one he'll cover to basically the same place uh let's read read it uh life preached in 1958 uh 519 e14 Christianity is based on Resurrection we know that not not well if you go down here and on Earth as a blackheaded woman you'll rise as a blackheaded woman you won't rise up you say well now if this is a what goes down in Resurrection that same has to come up not this and that's replacement so in other words he's saying if you done anything else is replacement that's not Resurrection resurrections bring the same Jesus up that went down the same person all right so if that's true then we're going down the same way coming back Garnet's funeral preach 1963 Garnet PS funeral 8 11:18 all Christianity is based on Resurrection that's our hopes now let's find out why the creator has so set it in order if we did not even have a Bible we would still know that Christianity was right now Resurrection is not replacement Resurrection is bringing the same thing up that went down if I should drop the the Bible from the stand on the floor and catch some another Bible and replace it that's replacement but Resurrection is bringing the same Bible up that went down and that's what Resurrection means it means to be raised up all right Christianity is placed up on Resurrection y not replacement amen now so then why would it be that it would be necessary to preedee this should give you an idea of where we're going why would it be necessary to precede the prophet's message with a Divine Healing campaign right that's according to Malachi 4 right Malachi 4 says the son of righteousness will Rising healing in his wings that's a healing campaign so before brother Brand's message could come his real message cuz his message began in ' 63 right not in the years of preparation cuz that was what Paul and him had already preached it began in' 63 of the opening of the seal all right now there would have to be a Divine Healing campaign all right now God is going to show them even back there in his Divine Healing campaign he was going to show what he's going to do right there was not a Divine Healing campaign in Luther's age Wesley's age or even the beginning of Pentecost now there was a lot of healing and signs and wonders in Pentecost right ausa Street come on but it basically began with brother brandom right NE even they listed with brother randam and or Roberts right so somewhere in the 30s there you begin the the late parts and you begin to talk about Divine Healing that's why they couldn't understand brother brandom because the word Divine Healing was meant but it was not Divine Healing that he was a Divine healer it was Divine Healing in that God is going to heal amen and he did that's what it means Divine Healing Divine Healing doesn't mean that you'll never get sick again cuz you can be sick of something be healed of it die the same thing it doesn't mean it's that way and that's where they misunderstood him cuz see it had to be though it had to be that a Divine Healing campaign would strike the world right to set a stage like I said now go back in the Bible and find it or the prophet's message and find it go back into history and find there's not not one in Lutheran Wesley right not one in early Pentecost it was right around 1940 somewhere 30 something to 40 that it started a Divine Healing campaign all right that would show that the son of righteousness would arise with healings in his wings all right people accepted that yes I've heard of myself and you have two of the the Great Men of the day ke osbor and different ones it says that they saw God y they saw a great man that would that God would honor his word and that you know even to the man that said when he's praying said it's God but said when he starts talking said it's William Bram well even that was an honor because other people didn't how that said about them all right but see it's coming to the place to where that something would be be start being set in motion all right now number 12 on your notes we jump a lot through the message so you read in between on a message called here ye him 1956 12:15 say no one can preach salvation without preaching Divine Healing you remember that was an argument with Dr Bess which is the next one down below there the angel of the Lord and Dr be talking to that man about it you know and the man was talking against Divine Healing no one can preach salvation without preaching Divine Healing so you can't preach Redemption of the Soul without preaching Redemption of the body see when you can't deal with sin in any measure L you deal with sickness and every attribute all right so what are we looking at no Divine Healing he says No Redemption of the body what do he say Divine Healing was the angel of the Lord 19 51502 says we have the earnest if there's no Divine Healing There's No Redemption of the body we have the earnest the down payment of our Salvation now right now Divine Healing is an earnest okay now if salvation is in stages justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost being each one a deeper work or meaning of God you know something taking place why can't we look at the Redemption of the body the same way see in the Redemption of the Soul even if we come to the New Birth it's just the earnest of our inheritance the new birth but see healing of the body is a down payment right now that's why I can't understand since once I've seen it now it's like everybody else when I was an organized religion I believe like everybody else cuz that's all I know we going to get a new body Glory Hallelujah they just smoke like everything we don't have to worry about this we going to throw this one down and get us another one you know you right right no matter what you do to this one well see I remember the Bible said for me not to do them things so I didn't do them that's before I come in the message I didn't like smoking so I throw it away never did drink never care nothing about none of that didn't care about vulgarity cuz I like my teeth to stay pretty straight and I knew if you said a lot of dirty words you can get your mouth busted I'm honest I no salvation set me free I just didn't care anything about all that H but you see if there's no Divine Healing There's No Redemption of the body now that's what your Prophet just say that's right if God can't heal this body he can't change the body right but if he can heal the body he can change the body cuz it's an Earnest so then they had to be a healing campaign strike the world that's right before the prophet would come with a message that would be dealing with the Redemption I hope you write that down there had to be a healing campaign right to show the healing of the body would be perfect and right right to show it could be done because mankind always believed in healing right Martin Luther preached and and prayed for the sick y had all kind of signs and wonders taking place right John Wesley rode a horse for 5,000 m a year preaching the gospel and the sick being healed and wouldn't he the one that the horse fell in the hole and broke his leg or whatever he got off he said God made me heal me God made the horse heal it pray the horse for the horse got on it and rode off there always been those things but never a never a Divine Healing campaign never a worldwide sweeping thing right Luther it was a worldwide sweeping of the message of the just shall live by faith right sanctification was a worldwide sweeping of of cleansing up the life and and getting ourselves Clean zeusa Street 1906 was a worldwide sweeping of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts being restored right y and those would be the healing amen but then there would come a time that there had to be a healing campaign strike the world to show God was going to show that he could heal right until even your Prophet said the Beatles said they were going to start a healing campaign right right such a pull in their day that's right until people were healed just by hearing music a healing campaign sweeps the world why cuz it's getting ready ready for what ready for the message to come that would BL bring into being an understanding of how that we can come to a Redemption of the body see I'm moving into it I got to back up again okay but see no matter what brother R said look and see he said that lady sitting there crippled up was said just a moment yep just a moment see it wasn't just brother brandom it's credited that brother brandham and all Roberts were the spearhead of the Divine Healing campaign right we believe that but see people went around but around and prayed for a man that know was missing 3 or 4 days or something before the nose restored brother BOS prayed for a man's nose that was missing eat all with cancer and it was instantly restored a Divine Healing campaign struck the world because God was going to testify of what he was going to bring into being y he was going to show first that he could heal the body he's going to prove to the world and he can heal the body do you hear Brother random telling he said bring me 24 of your worst cases and I will guarantee you healing for every one of them now where's there ever been a man standing like that right that's how much he knew where he stood but he said knowing the message would come don't you ever listen the brother around saying that he said knowing the message with come what message the message to show us the revealing of the Redemption of the body so that we can to it understand but get this right if we don't understand healing we don't understand Redeeming the body but a God that can take a cancere eaten patient and instantly restore them right till they can't even find it how much more would it take for him to just move that right on out in the rest of us that's right amen but the only difference was he's only going to restore that person back to original Health other words cancer gone the eat up the the whatever's done is gone and a lot of times God doesn't choose to do it that way right that's right the life goes out of the cancer the body has to purify the cancer or either go have it taken out or whatever sometimes it makes a patient that much more sicker because the body is reacting trying to help its own self because God in the beginning put in you in the garden right an ability to fight off diseases an immune system y you know people don't die of age you don't die of age that's right what brother dying around the world you don't die of age you die of complications age is not the killer it's a destroyer of the immune system right when you destroy the immune system then anything else takes over right they just can't figure out how to B pass and help the immune system they're doing a good job now helping people they don't kill people right we wind up probably more killed by drugs than anything else but yeah that's all right we still believe in medicine amen watch what he says here on the pool of Bethesda 19581 18 he talking about the Redeemed God sent his son made in the form of sinful flesh that's redeemed us and we believe now that we have the earnest of our Salvation a foretaste of what heaven will be by the Holy Spirit and we believe that through Divine Healing we have the earnest of our redeemed bodies father a crippled up woman nervous sick but Thou Art here remove this curse have mercy upon her go to go home well you see what we're dealing with no wonder he would make this statement he said we talk about all kind of faith he said we ain't even got enough Faith to heal a two thing come on oh bless God I tell you no don't holler too much cuz you're going to make the devil mad at you you make the devil mad at you going to jump on you right right right don't challenge him unless you got the goods old boy that used to work with everybody thought he was a big blow you know and I knew better than what a lot of them did about him and you know so one day a guy that's jumped up and puffed in his face well he just knocked the fire out of it and gave a good whooping well come find out everybody found out what I already knew he wouldn't such a bluff anyway just don't Bluff the devil unless you got the goods cuz he's a bluff and he's a professional but he can fight too you better have the goods when you challenge him you say I take every spirit in this building under my control your Prophet said you better you better have it CU if you don't you just open up the cans and made him mad at you right see but if there's no Divine Healing there is no Earnest of our redeemed body y do you understand what I'm talking about then a Divine Healing campaign struck the world God was setting the stage and you know he never stopped setting it Divine Healing didn't stop with the prophet amen they're proven it out there even in the world they're still they're having healing campaigns all around the world people are being healed right come on yes you you don't have to be in this message to have a healing campaign that's right matter of fact the people in this message are not having healing campaigns it's the people outside of this message that are having but see they're living in a bygone day right but they're having healings and things y look at number 17 on your notes fundamental F foundation for Faith 1956 1113 Jesus couldn't come to redeem us from just and just sin without redeeming us from sickness are all the things that goes with it even to death that's right he redeemed us from death now watch it now this is for later he redeemed us from death what and we do not die amen what do you mean we go to the funeral every day that's not dead there's not a scripture in the Bible that says a Christian dies that's what your Prophet had to say about it death they said we go to the Undertaker we look at it we say death no uhuh fear him that can destroy the soul y that's right that person just moved right out of that body right into another condition right whether it be sinner or Saint that's right there's no way to kill the soul God is the only one that can kill the soul right okay you just step right out of that brother around like referring to about the the little girl you know that said see there said she wasn't dead she was just sleeping there in the ministry of Jesus right do you understand yes no Divine Healing no Resurrection you see why we ought to emphasize healing right amen we should right amen but now I'm also like that on this basis and that's the reason I Don't Preach like other people I Don't Preach against High dress clothes when this because if you if you preach every one of them the people are going to still be the same that's right but if you preach the gospel get delivered it'll take care of all them things and that's the way I preach cuz that's the way I believe it well then it wouldn't do us any good to say okay now we're going to start and we're going to start the ladies can't go to Pigeon Forge and the men can't go fishing cuz we're going to start tomorrow night Tuesday night Wednesday night Thurday night Friday night Saturday Sunday Monday two or 3 weeks we're going to have healing campaign every night we're going to preach on nothing but healing well that sounds good you know if I've ever led to I do it but never been LED do it like that you know why cuz I like to do it like Richard was done talking testifying of last week I I like to preach it and then you get up here and come here and tell me I was delivered back there I was delivered here I was delivered there I like for that to happen why because it's you taking apart see you're catching on to what I'm doing right so why have a healing campaign every night now we should have I agree with you we ought to have services for the next 6 months every night right on the preaching of the gospel because the preaching of the Gospel will come to Healing amen he told me that years ago I asked God a question one day and he said you preach it and I'll back it up all he said you think man I've been trying my best to to preach all I can he said no but you ain't bringing it right you preach the gospel and I'll back it up you preach the truth and I'll back it up I started doing the best I could preach to the truth and you think I wasn't trying to preach the truth before then I just seen the importance of preaching of the word I can get up here and start and I can bring up Al and how that that his mother is so and so and his daddy's so and so and brother collie I can bring up somebody in his family or something like that I can go back in there and I can get every one of your feelings and have you just feeling good you know you just really all you just feelings are good and you know watch you walk yourself right into healing instead of doing that sometimes I have to say why you acting so grumpy and he looks at me and say I say it to him a a lot of y'all ain't going to say that to he look at me and he said brother Dale just keep preaching until I get it help me get delivered from myself that's right healing see we don't die we have Divine Healing as the earnest of our Immortal bodies which is coming on that's in that same one fundamental foundation for faith you want an immortal body get in the word right Walk In The Word these other things will take care of itself we walk right into a change of the body amen that's right and I don't believe it's like brother Mo used to ustr he said you run like going up a ladder you know well you don't don't do it you're going to get hurt don't run into a ladder and jump about three runs up you know and take all no just take one step brother how you sure don't want to come down of Miss some of them do you you're going to get hurt just take one step at a time right man let's just walk in the word as God reveals it that's right you know why because we'll be ready for the change because it's going to be revealed to us that we're changed all right and when it's revealed to us that we're changed we'll stand here and just go right on this is happy to be here but we'll know it's over right cuz I'm talking about the Redemption of to Wi to understand the Redemption amen not to just get changed that's a simple thing then Here Comes brother Rand along what conduct order and Doctrine he said what's the change he said just a change amen that's what he said right around I ask you a question he said and I answered it it's just a change he said your glorified body is being built around your Born Again experience amen y he said the same way that it was in Mary what just forming a baby as she ate what do you think about it what do you think about it but I just want to be changed well let let's believe in Divine Healing too amen let's get Divine Healing right who was it one of the men one of the Great Men asked about BR said something about and he said you know he said no he said go sit down under that talking about brother BOS the old old tree he said go and sit down under him and sit there a while then later on he referred about it he said I look at him and see he said I spent all this struggle in my Ministry and trying to get people to believe he said he just takes the word and just tie Satan in such a knot till Satan cannot do it he said people are healed you don't ever listen to that how are we healed by the revealed word god reveals to you that you're heal then you just step into it come on brother then you just step right over into it so my concern is what to Wi to understand the Redemption of this body there's my adoption right cuz you see you'll catch on real quick that the three stages of adoption that I've been talking about doesn't end with a change that's right that is is the completion yeah but the third stage of adoption is to get the understanding that you're redeemed right a lot of difference in the two now you better consider that statement I just made that's a message on down the road the to get the Revelation that you're redeemed right there is your adoption that Paul was speaking of the redemp to understand the Redemption there's never been a day to understand it to this day let's go ahead what we got let number 223 in r book 223 anybody have a e sing them word again to me wonderful Words of Life let more of their beaut words of life and Beauty me great and be beautiful wonderful wonderful words of beautiful wonderful s you got a problem with diarrhea is not here today so let's just send a prayer father PR father in the name of our Lord and saor Jesus Christ we s this to believe that by your stripes word make it Jesus can't believe it wonderful another I pray for you if I don't believe God can deliver you I'm not going trying to make you feel good I'm going to try my best to pray the
