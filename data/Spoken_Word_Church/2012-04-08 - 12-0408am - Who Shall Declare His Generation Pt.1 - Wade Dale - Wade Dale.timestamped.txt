[11:35] amen and the title of the sermon will be
[11:38] who shall declare his
[11:40] generation who shall
[11:42] declare his generation Our genealogy
[11:46] which is a what family all right who
[11:48] shall declare his family turn to Isaiah
[11:51] 53 and we'll read scripture there they
[11:55] should have all this up they doing a
[11:57] wonderful job all the these quotes and
[11:59] everything we won't have as many quotes
[12:00] today we're going to read a lot of
[12:01] scripture but we're going to we're going
[12:03] to dwell on two points today going to
[12:06] take time dwell on two points today one
[12:09] is Adam and Eve and and the what
[12:13] happened in the genealogy in the Garden
[12:15] of Eden and then we're going to look at
[12:19] why the Holy Ghost wasn't given in the
[12:21] Old Testament they're not part of the
[12:24] family of God as in Sons and Daughters
[12:27] of God coming straight from God they're
[12:29] the Bible even calls um calls Abraham a
[12:32] friend of God right all right so they're
[12:34] not in the family as far as sons and
[12:36] daughters and we're going to try to

[18:31] with us forgive us of our sins and our
[18:33] daily mistakes that we make Lord just be
[18:35] a part of our life in Jesus name we pray
[18:38] amen Isaiah
[18:41] 53:1 who hath believed thy report and to
[18:44] whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for
[18:46] he shall grow up before him as a tender
[18:48] plant and as a root out of dry ground
[18:50] now remember who he talking about Jesus
[18:52] Christ growing up he have no form or
[18:54] commonness in when we shall see him
[18:56] there's no beauty that we should desire
[18:58] him he is despised and rejected of men a
[19:01] man of sorrow and acquainted with grief
[19:03] and we hid as it was our face from him
[19:05] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[19:08] surely Heath borne our griefs and
[19:09] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[19:12] him stricken smitten of God and
[19:13] Afflicted but that was man's idea right
[19:16] but he was W was wounded for our
[19:19] transgression he was bruised for our
[19:21] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[19:23] was upon him and with his Strife we are
[19:26] healed now remember that happened in his
[19:27] body
[19:28] all right all we have all we like sheep
[19:31] have gone astray we have turned everyone
[19:33] to his own way now that's you and I
[19:34] being lost and out in the world right
[19:37] and the Lord hath laid on him the
[19:39] iniquity of us all amen he was oppressed
[19:42] he was afflicted yet he opened not his
[19:43] mouth he is brought as a lamb to the
[19:45] slaughter and as a sheep before her
[19:46] shears his dumb so he opened not his
[19:49] mouth he was taken from prison here's
[19:51] the here's the theme of the of the
[19:54] message he was taken from prison and
[19:56] from
[19:57] judgment PR come from prison went to
[19:59] Pilot's Hall they judged him and who
[20:02] shall declare his generation for he was
[20:06] cut off out of the land of the living in
[20:08] other words he was killed right if a
[20:10] man's dead his his genealogy ends right
[20:14] all right who shall declare his
[20:16] generation question mark for he was cut
[20:19] off of cut off of the land of the living
[20:22] for the transgression of my people was
[20:25] he stricken you may be seated in the
[20:27] Lord add his Blessing to the of his word
[20:29] and let's go now to Daniel
[20:33] 9 cuz we're going to see today we're
[20:35] going to take a natural part we're going
[20:38] to look at the Eternal genealogy of God
[20:40] but we're going to see the natural part
[20:41] remember the two points we're going to
[20:43] deal with today and and like I said
[20:46] Wednesday night brother Daniel did a
[20:48] wonderful job and he brought a lot of
[20:49] things out that were that were just
[20:51] really wonderful but I want to kind of
[20:53] expound on it and and maybe take two
[20:56] services and and kind of expound on on
[20:59] the family of Jesus Christ or the family
[21:01] of God because who shall declare
[21:03] somebody's got to declare his generation
[21:05] it's not Jesus Christ died 2,000 years
[21:06] ago when he's done finished and we're
[21:08] all that we're not children of God we
[21:10] have nothing to do with with our
[21:12] heavenly father but that's not the way
[21:14] God wanted it he saw remember he
[21:17] predestinated before the foundation of
[21:19] the world put your name in the Lamb's
[21:20] Book of Life So Daniel
[21:22] 9:24 70 weeks are determined upon thy
[21:25] people and upon thy Holy City to do six
[21:28] things right cuz look at these six
[21:30] things in in chapter 53 of Isaiah and
[21:32] this is the sixfold purpose is what he's
[21:34] doing
[21:35] remember he come to get
[21:38] Israel but watch he was cut
[21:41] off just like he was cut off here should
[21:43] have Clare as generation and make an end
[21:45] of s finish transgression make an end of
[21:47] sins to make reconciliation for iniquity
[21:50] to bring an everlasting righteousness
[21:52] seal up the vision and prophecy and
[21:54] anoint the most holy all
[21:57] right give you a little key brother
[21:58] Daniel said something last week about
[22:00] the resurrection starting from within
[22:02] the Earth
[22:04] yeah I'll read you something in a few
[22:06] minutes know therefore and understand
[22:08] that from the going forth of the
[22:09] Commandment to restore and build
[22:10] Jerusalem to the Messiah the prince
[22:12] shall be seven weeks that 7 we period
[22:15] then there's a 62 we period right
[22:16] everybody knows that in Daniel 70 weeks
[22:18] the street shall be built again the wall
[22:20] even troublous time now that's a that is
[22:22] a prophecy of a natural happening right
[22:25] right that's going to happen and it
[22:28] already has happened cuz after three
[22:30] score in two weeks what on the 69 after
[22:32] the 69 weeks yeah two I mean the 62 and
[22:37] 7even Y right that's 69 after the three
[22:41] after three score and two weeks shall
[22:42] Messiah be cut
[22:44] off go back to Isaiah same thing right
[22:47] who shall declare his generation because
[22:49] he cut off from the land of the living
[22:50] right all right and after three score in
[22:52] two weeks shall Messiah be cut off but
[22:54] not for himself amen he didn't die just
[22:57] for himself
[22:58] he didn't die just for Israel he didn't
[23:00] he died for us and Israel all right but
[23:04] not for himself and the people of the
[23:06] prince that shall come shall destroy the
[23:08] city that's the Gentile and the
[23:10] sanctuary that was Titus and the end
[23:12] thereof shall be with the flood until
[23:13] the end of the war desolations are
[23:15] determined but he was cut off what he
[23:19] was cut off so that who could come in
[23:20] you and I could come in right is that
[23:23] correct you he cut off Daniel 70 week
[23:27] shows that the Messiah week is 7 week
[23:29] how many so one week is 7 years so 3 and
[23:32] 1/2 years he preached he was cut off and
[23:33] he's got 3 and 1/2 more to preach but we
[23:35] know there's a one more week period cuz
[23:37] if you keep on going which we're not
[23:38] going to talk about Daniel 70 weeks
[23:40] today but there's three periods the
[23:43] first
[23:44] one the second one is 62 the first one
[23:47] is right here right all right then
[23:50] there's another week and in the midst of
[23:53] the week of the other time coming up
[23:56] they're going to make a covenant and
[23:57] then in the middle of that week right
[23:59] natural all right but look at the
[24:01] spiritual part he was cut off but not
[24:03] for himself he was cut off among the
[24:06] land of living why was he cut off he was
[24:07] cut
[24:08] off because of what happened in the
[24:11] Garden of Eden right the natural lineage
[24:15] of
[24:17] Jesus there was no natural lineage right
[24:20] so it wasn't that he was being cut off
[24:23] for
[24:24] himself he was being cut off to get you
[24:27] and amen out of him right all right so
[24:31] now is't that correct amen cuz we're
[24:35] bottled up inside of Jesus Christ we're
[24:37] bottled up inside of almighty God before
[24:39] the foundation of the world we're not
[24:40] some floating vessel over here and God
[24:42] some floating vessel over here right no
[24:45] we were born in His image now let's go
[24:47] to my favorite
[24:50] scripture Genesis 1 26 and
[24:55] 27 and God said
[24:59] let us make man in our image after our
[25:02] likeness and let them have dominion over
[25:05] the fish of the sea and over the foul of
[25:07] the
[25:08] air that's what Adam and Eve were doing
[25:11] right right and over the cattle and over
[25:13] the Earth because what's going to happen
[25:15] this part of God this this part of God
[25:19] that moved over went into Genesis 27
[25:22] right Genesis 126 man into the 27 man
[25:25] correct this is not flesh man
[25:28] this is Spirit man all right over F of
[25:32] the air and over the C and over all the
[25:34] Earth and over every creeping thing that
[25:35] creepeth upon the Earth so God created
[25:37] man in his own image in the image of God
[25:40] created he him male and female created
[25:44] he them right that's a them not a thee
[25:47] all right created he them now this
[25:52] scripture is the Eternal genealogy of
[25:56] God Amen exactly right this is his
[25:59] children right this is not Abraham Isaac
[26:03] Jacob
[26:05] Joseph um John the
[26:07] Baptist this is the children of the
[26:09] Kingdom right the least in the kingdom
[26:13] is greater than John now John got the
[26:16] Holy Ghost yes he did but he didn't get
[26:18] the new birth right he wasn't born into
[26:21] the family of God right amen he received
[26:24] an anointing just like Abraham Isaac
[26:26] Jacob that's why we're going to read in
[26:28] a minute that they were given to us for
[26:30] examples not full
[26:32] examples you can't type Abraham all the
[26:35] way through Abraham's Journey don't go
[26:38] give your wife away twice right don't
[26:42] laugh at God right but remember
[26:46] God God said let us make man this was
[26:49] the part of God that brother R said this
[26:52] Genesis 126 man went into the two7 man
[26:57] now now remember this is the generation
[27:00] of God Amen this is The Book of Life The
[27:04] Eternal section right brother D's going
[27:07] to be covering that you watch that book
[27:08] go all the way to to Revelations 5 right
[27:11] amen this is the book in Revelations 5
[27:14] right the redeemed this is the
[27:16] redeemable exactly the others are not
[27:18] redeemable this is
[27:20] redeemable why because you were before
[27:23] the foundation of the world God saw you
[27:26] listen right
[27:28] put you in a family
[27:30] album this group right here in the
[27:33] spiritual never needed
[27:36] regeneration
[27:39] right this group never needed
[27:41] regeneration this group was perfect this
[27:44] group was God made manifest in another
[27:46] form right called Sons and Daughters
[27:49] amen amen right
[27:52] amen this is not
[27:56] mankind this is man the only M that ever
[28:00] was and that's
[28:01] Christ right this is Christ we are
[28:05] Christ made manifest in another form God
[28:07] takes this and remember you take the one
[28:10] seed and put it in the ground it grows a
[28:12] tree that has many
[28:16] apples one seed many apples one seed
[28:19] remember Galatians 3 we're going to read
[28:21] those scriptures right but this is the
[28:24] family album of God before the
[28:26] foundation of the
[28:28] world right before the foundation of the
[28:32] world this happened
[28:34] right let's look at the first
[28:38] quote questions and answers now look
[28:41] take a cell you break it down from a
[28:43] cell and it comes into a cell and a cell
[28:45] into an molecule down like that and
[28:48] finally it ends up into the
[28:50] Unseen it goes from a natural something
[28:53] you put your hand on to gases from gases
[28:55] to acid acid to gases gas GES on back
[28:58] like that till it finally all winds up
[29:00] to one little thing and that is Spirit
[29:04] yeah and this Spirit who has occupied
[29:07] these gases he's talking about us human
[29:09] beings when we die and go
[29:12] away it might not be the same gases but
[29:15] the features that you are will be
[29:17] exactly what they are again amen see the
[29:20] spirit has control that if the spirit of
[29:23] him that rais up Jesus from the dead
[29:24] dwell in you he will also Quicken your
[29:27] what moral mortal body your Soul's
[29:29] already quickened by the new birth amen
[29:31] all right and now in other words when
[29:33] you become a young man or young woman
[29:34] and like God takes a picture of you
[29:36] that's right now no matter but now look
[29:38] be
[29:39] careful be
[29:42] careful cuz watch the quote down at the
[29:45] bottom God takes a picture of you now no
[29:47] matter how old or wrinkled disfigured
[29:49] whatever it be that will wind right on
[29:51] down through and that body may be
[29:52] destroyed disfigured burnt eat up my
[29:54] lines whatever but it was made up of
[29:57] gases let me tell you something God
[29:58] thinks enough of your flesh so he's
[29:59] going to preserve it all right so we're
[30:02] going to watch that now because remember
[30:03] everybody we talking about Adam Adam was
[30:06] the man earthy right amen and he had a
[30:11] we're in Adam's race yeah Adam's what
[30:15] family I'm looking at Adam's
[30:17] genealogy flesh
[30:21] right that was calcium and potach and
[30:23] petroleum and Cosmic light and so forth
[30:25] all goes together to make up the body
[30:27] now no matter that the whole Earth is
[30:29] filled with that yeah but now this
[30:31] picture is the main
[30:33] thing then in the resurrection those
[30:35] gases and acids and things come right
[30:38] back into the place and develops this
[30:40] picture again exactly now this picture
[30:42] was not taken when you were 16 or 18 or
[30:45] 20
[30:47] right when was it taken amen before
[30:50] there was a foundation of the world
[30:52] right Genesis 1:26 and 27 came into
[30:55] being amen right
[30:58] before there was a foundation of the
[31:00] world it was put in God's Great file
[31:03] family album amen and then only thing it
[31:06] did was featured itself here for you to
[31:08] make your choice right amen see then you
[31:11] become a servant of God him knowing it
[31:15] makes him a
[31:16] redeemer as we've been through it then
[31:18] that picture is absolutely this is the
[31:20] negative right we think this is so great
[31:24] and so wonderful this is the negative of
[31:27] the positive picture right this the
[31:30] pictures absolutely this is the negative
[31:32] look how much God thinks of us
[31:35] amen back before there was any
[31:38] time he knew how many children he was
[31:40] going to have he knew their names he
[31:42] knew what they're going to look like and
[31:44] he put them in an album and he preserved
[31:47] us the negative part of life is where
[31:49] you're living now and you know what he
[31:50] didn't do he didn't go preserve it in
[31:52] somebody else he preserved it in himself
[31:55] right right and anything if there is a
[31:58] negative there's got to be a positive
[32:00] before there can be a negative right
[32:02] therefore if this is a
[32:04] negative there's got to be a positive
[32:07] somewhere amen and this isn't the real
[32:09] thing right this is only a foreshadow of
[32:12] the real thing that is to come now you
[32:15] get it so I don't care what you would do
[32:17] with you they cannot destroy that
[32:20] profile that picture in God's Great
[32:22] Gallery up
[32:24] there sounds like we're declaring
[32:26] somebody's gener doesn't it right it
[32:29] cannot destroy it it's in heaven right
[32:32] you can burn it up feed it to the lines
[32:34] do anything any way you want to it'll
[32:36] come forth again just as sure as the two
[32:38] twos is four amen just as sure as God
[32:41] spoke it it'll come forth so no matter
[32:43] where you are in other words no matter
[32:44] what happens to you do not worry right
[32:47] God has already got a position that's a
[32:50] place for you amen if you're a son and
[32:52] daughter of God if you've made your
[32:55] choice exactly
[32:57] to be a son and daughter of God so we
[33:00] are truly spoken word seed children
[33:03] forget about the natural right now right
[33:05] we're spoken word seeed children it did
[33:07] not take a sexual act to get us in God
[33:11] right come on we going to look at Adam
[33:14] and Eve here in just a minute it's not
[33:16] it did not take a sexual act to get you
[33:19] in the family of God right it was a
[33:21] spiritual spoken brother BR preach the
[33:23] spoken word is the Original Seed all
[33:26] right so let's don't worry so much about
[33:30] here and there and here and there let's
[33:31] go to Genesis
[33:35] 2:7 and the Lord God formed man of the
[33:37] Dust of the ground and breathed through
[33:38] his nostrils the breath of life and Man
[33:41] became a living Soul right man became a
[33:44] living Soul Adam become walking
[33:48] around had the Genesis 126 he was the
[33:51] son of God he was eternal right in his
[33:53] soul he was eternal right amen right now
[33:57] go to verse and you get up 18 and you're
[34:01] going a little bit
[34:02] further and the Lord God said it's not
[34:04] do we've already read these remember we
[34:06] went through when we talked about the
[34:07] man and the woman but let's that's why I
[34:08] said hold your point we'll get back to
[34:10] the spiritual but let's see what
[34:12] happened in the
[34:13] natural the Lord God said it's not good
[34:15] that the man should be alone I will make
[34:17] him a help meat what we say that was
[34:19] help meat one suitable to help him amen
[34:21] all right and out of the ground the Lord
[34:23] God formed every beast of the field male
[34:26] and female
[34:27] right every file of the air male and
[34:29] female brought them under Adam to see
[34:31] what he would call them and whatsoever
[34:33] Adam called every living creature that
[34:35] was the name thereof why Adam was a Son
[34:37] of God he had the mind of Christ for his
[34:40] day listen I said for his day cuz you
[34:44] got to watch what he did afterwards but
[34:45] he had the mind of Christ for his day
[34:48] and Adam was there and and I'm sorry and
[34:50] Adam gave names to all the cattle foul
[34:52] the air in other words he sees the male
[34:54] and the female coming up and God already
[34:55] told them to multiply replenish the
[34:57] Earth right so by so by sex they were
[35:00] going they were multiplying and
[35:01] replenishing the Earth cuz they had the
[35:02] organs for it and that's the way God
[35:05] animals that done mind you don't have to
[35:07] cover animal up when they're when
[35:09] they're breeding you understand what I'm
[35:10] saying everybody okay with that cuz what
[35:13] because they're they're lower form
[35:15] they're they're living they're living
[35:16] life but they're not a soul they're not
[35:18] something with a conscience to say I
[35:20] shouldn't do that or I should do that no
[35:22] that just what happens by Nature right
[35:25] so Adam sees all that
[35:27] cuz remember Adam's got the mind of God
[35:30] that's he's a living soul but he's got
[35:33] the mind of God remember he was God of
[35:36] the Earth
[35:38] right and Adam gave names to all the
[35:40] cattle foul of the air beast of the
[35:42] field but for Adam see Adam Saw 2 by two
[35:45] 2 by two 2 by two 2 by two but for Adam
[35:48] it was just him it was not found a help
[35:51] meet suitable a help suitable for him
[35:54] and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to
[35:55] fall upon Adam and he slept and he took
[35:57] one of his ribs and closed up the flesh
[35:59] instead
[36:00] thereof now remember he closed the flesh
[36:03] up and the rib which the Lord God took
[36:05] from the man he made a woman and brought
[36:07] her under man and Adam said this is now
[36:10] bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh she
[36:12] shall be called woman because she was
[36:14] taken out of man amen the word woman
[36:16] means a man with a womb right so now now
[36:20] Adam and Eve can do what God told him to
[36:22] do in Genesis 1:26 and 27 right multiply
[36:27] and replenish the Earth right but now
[36:30] not by sex but by Spoken Word every how
[36:33] you figure it can come that doesn't
[36:36] matter we were not supposed to have sex
[36:38] to bring kids period all right you say
[36:41] well what about the organs I'll read it
[36:42] to you in a
[36:43] minute oh I can't read it to you the
[36:46] diglot the diglot says animal flesh we
[36:51] were put we were made animal when we
[36:53] read about earthy about over there in
[36:55] Corinthians where Adam was was made
[36:57] Earth the man earthy that actually said
[36:59] animal yeah so we're animal flesh this
[37:02] is this is the highest form of animal
[37:04] flesh so if an animal boy had a and an
[37:08] animal girl had
[37:10] a keep it in your mind yeah then Adam
[37:14] and Eve had to have the same parts or
[37:15] they would be they would not be in the
[37:17] creation line rightly God created amen
[37:21] Genesis 2:7 man was not something out of
[37:24] the line no he come right up through
[37:26] because remember in Romans 8 the whole
[37:29] creation fell because of Adam but now if
[37:31] he would have been something different
[37:32] the creation wouldn't have fa right but
[37:34] since he fell the whole creation fell
[37:36] below it all right so God put that 126
[37:40] and 27 man into
[37:42] Adam to reproduce himself then he brings
[37:45] a part out therefore shall man leave his
[37:47] father and mother and shall clle to his
[37:49] wife and they shall be one flesh looks
[37:50] like that kind of what we're ending up
[37:52] to now right all right so
[37:55] now number two Blasphemous
[37:59] name dad's read this many times let's
[38:02] read it again but now here Jehovah
[38:05] Witness in their book it says that the
[38:06] breath that you breathe is a soul which
[38:08] they call it aoya if you want to read on
[38:10] down through there but let's just read
[38:11] the other save time now take the
[38:13] scripture from back and God breathed
[38:15] breath into his nostrils and he began a
[38:17] living Soul now I want to ask you
[38:18] something if he was a man what kind of a
[38:21] breath was he breathing before God
[38:23] breathed his breath of life into it
[38:25] right he was a living Soul what kind of
[38:27] breath he was breathing living man yeah
[38:30] well then if that be so then every
[38:31] animal is a living Soul he talking about
[38:32] if he if it's the breath right cuz they
[38:35] breathe a human soul if that's the way
[38:37] it's supposed to be which it's not we
[38:39] know that and our soul and all together
[38:41] then Jesus wouldn't have had to Die the
[38:44] animal sacrifice would have been
[38:45] sufficient hold that
[38:48] point so brother the argument don't
[38:50] stand but what God did he breathed the
[38:52] breath of eternal life amen when he
[38:54] became a living Soul a soul that can't
[38:56] die now watch now we're going to get
[38:58] into honey Plum up to your elbows now
[39:00] watch breathe the breath of eternal life
[39:01] into his nostrils and he became an
[39:03] eternal Soul cuz God breathed not what
[39:06] nature done right but what God did
[39:09] breathed the breath of life into his
[39:10] nostrils and he became a living Soul you
[39:13] then you say to me Adam died brother
[39:15] brand but remember before Adam died he
[39:18] had a lamb to redeem it Hallelujah those
[39:22] who he forew he called he got a lamb to
[39:24] redeem them he was a Ty Adam fell now
[39:29] Adam didn't fall from eternal life in
[39:31] his soul does everybody understand that
[39:33] he fell from eternal life in his body
[39:36] all right then the lamb was provided for
[39:38] Adam because already in his nostrils had
[39:40] become the breath of Eternal God and he
[39:42] became a living Soul he was a Son of God
[39:45] he was actually the only son of God in
[39:46] the Old Testament we'll read that in
[39:47] just a minute not his breath as the
[39:51] African word amoya then why would we
[39:54] struggle for eternal life if that's the
[39:56] Eternal Soul breathed into us by breath
[39:59] why would we struggle for eternal life
[40:00] it backfires brother see it just can't
[40:03] do it but gone especially upon Adam
[40:05] exactly breathed the breath of eternal
[40:07] life and he became an eternal person
[40:09] with God he had power like God he was an
[40:12] amature God he was God of the earth not
[40:14] God Of Heaven now God of the earth and
[40:17] someday he didn't leave it to Adam amen
[40:20] and someday the sons of God will again
[40:22] become Gods Glory Jesus said it's
[40:25] written in your law you're God and if
[40:26] you can call those who he call God who
[40:28] God visited how can you condemn me say
[40:30] when I say I'm the Son of God see now
[40:32] we're getting into something deep right
[40:35] that's what we're fixing to do okay now
[40:37] here they are he is now a Son of God but
[40:40] he makes a
[40:41] mistake and he knows he's doing wrong
[40:45] right amen he's a Son of God he's got
[40:48] the mind of God he knows he's doing
[40:50] wrong right Eve didn't Adam did we're
[40:54] getting to a point here now now remember
[40:56] Adam was not deceived amen the Bible
[40:59] said so 1 Timothy 3 Adam was not
[41:01] deceived but the woman was deceived was
[41:03] in the transgression Adam walked with
[41:06] Eve because it was his wife same as
[41:09] Christ not deceived by Satan but walked
[41:13] into the death with the bride he went to
[41:16] be with the bride so he could redeem the
[41:18] church in other words he came down here
[41:20] all right Adam know he was wrong so he
[41:22] just walked out with Eve see but there
[41:25] was a lamb provided for them that they
[41:27] were redeemed see they were covering
[41:30] theel with fig leaves God just said
[41:31] forget that jump here cover the whole
[41:33] thing right put this on and these Lambs
[41:36] today that were for on by God and God is
[41:39] called there is a redeemer talking about
[41:40] us no man can come to me except my
[41:43] father draws all the father has given me
[41:44] will come that's right congregation says
[41:46] amen so there is a provided lamb from
[41:49] the foundation of the world where their
[41:52] names were put on the Lamb's Book of
[41:54] Life right a lamb was provided to make
[41:56] way of Grace now what is Grace for is
[42:01] for something you've done in the past
[42:04] not for what you've done in the future
[42:05] we're not
[42:07] Catholics that's premeditated if you do
[42:09] it before all right but for grace for
[42:11] what we were trapped into or the thing
[42:13] that we didn't know was wrong and it was
[42:15] wrong and we asked God to forgive us
[42:18] give us Grace for everything that
[42:20] happened afterward I'm working toward
[42:22] something here cuz something I I believe
[42:24] the Lord showed me this and I brother
[42:26] they can corank me if I'm wrong but I
[42:28] think this is what the the part that
[42:30] Adam and Eve and all this stuff that
[42:31] they're thinking that what they did was
[42:34] watch a lamb was provided to make a way
[42:37] of
[42:38] Grace Grace was what for what you done
[42:41] in the past to make a way of Grace for
[42:43] every one of them to go in the
[42:45] resurrection a provided lamb Adam's lamb
[42:48] now notice as Adam had a provided lamb
[42:52] right right now
[42:55] remember in the fall Satan used the
[42:59] Beast to stop a Son of God from being
[43:02] born
[43:03] yeah right cuz the Beast came to Eve put
[43:07] a natural genetic seed into
[43:11] Eve so that it polluted the womb there's
[43:14] no way that God's program could continue
[43:17] in that condition right right stopped it
[43:21] correct right now what's he still trying
[43:25] to do now sure he's trying to stop Sons
[43:28] and Daughters of God from being born
[43:30] spiritual all right but now
[43:33] look Adam could not save
[43:39] Eve he wasn't the Savior
[43:42] right right amen that's right right amen
[43:47] but he could protect him right or
[43:50] preserver yeah he could protect and
[43:52] preserve but he couldn't save Eve he
[43:54] could not bring her back from the
[43:56] condition she was in cuz the natural act
[43:58] had already took place there's no way
[44:01] Adam could turn back time
[44:04] exactly let's go to Romans
[44:10] 5 now people are
[44:14] are discussing or preaching that Adam
[44:18] put his natural seed into Eve to save
[44:22] her you can't save her there's no
[44:26] natural genetic sperm let me be plain
[44:30] will ever save
[44:32] anybody nevertheless death rain let's
[44:35] let the Bible prove it nevertheless
[44:38] death rained from Adam right so anything
[44:42] Adam did after that is death
[44:46] right nevertheless death reigned from
[44:49] Adam to MOS even over them that had not
[44:52] sinned after the similitude of Adam's
[44:54] transgression
[44:56] death reigned in other words look death
[44:58] reigned over let me make it plain even
[45:01] over them that didn't do the sin that
[45:03] Adam did yeah amen but being in Adam's
[45:05] Fallen race right when God cursed that
[45:08] ground anything come out of that ground
[45:11] is cursed anything that's why Jesus
[45:14] didn't come out of that ground right
[45:19] amen even over them that had not sinned
[45:22] after the similitude of Adam's
[45:23] transgression now keep in your mind who
[45:26] shall declare his
[45:28] generation right who is the figure of
[45:31] him that was to come which is what Jesus
[45:33] Christ but not as the offense so also is
[45:37] the free gift for through the offense of
[45:39] one man many be dead
[45:43] right if Adam seed was some special
[45:46] something Abel would not have had to
[45:49] drug that lamb up right and sacrificed
[45:52] it I get to a point here in a minute but
[45:55] not is the offense so also is the free
[45:57] gift for if through the offense of many
[46:00] of one many be dead right much more the
[46:04] grace of God and the gift of Grace which
[46:07] is by one man Jesus Christ hath abounded
[46:10] unto many in other words
[46:12] Grace come through who Jesus Christ not
[46:16] Adam and not not as it was by one that
[46:20] sin so is the gift for the Judgment was
[46:23] by one the condemnation Adam
[46:27] not Eve Adam right cuz the Bible said in
[46:30] Adam all
[46:31] die right and not as by one that sin so
[46:35] is the gift for the Judgment was by one
[46:37] to condemnation but the free gift is of
[46:40] many offenses under
[46:44] justification Jesus rose for our amen
[46:47] justification right for If by one man's
[46:51] offense death reigned by
[46:53] one much more they which which receive
[46:56] of the abundance of Grace and of the
[46:59] gift of righteousness shall reign in
[47:00] life by one amen Jesus Christ all right
[47:04] so that's the only way we're going to
[47:05] get out of this mess is to get into
[47:06] Christ all right so now First
[47:09] Corinthians 15 I think brother collee
[47:11] may have read this this morning for
[47:13] since by man come death right by man
[47:18] came also the resurrection of the dead
[47:20] right am for as in Adam all die even so
[47:25] in Christ shall all be made alive those
[47:28] first Adam second Adam all
[47:30] right but the first Adam could not save
[47:34] his bride Eve he could only cover her or
[47:37] preserve her or or or just do like
[47:40] brother rown said you know he couldn't
[47:42] get to
[47:44] Eve he couldn't get to Sarah because of
[47:47] Abraham the head the headship was
[47:50] established there in Genesis right all
[47:54] right number three
[48:01] let's read what Adam did but he's
[48:03] forfeit that Adam forfeit the title deed
[48:06] to it what the Earth eternal life to
[48:10] this all this stuff that we own eternal
[48:12] life and the inheriting of the Earth
[48:14] right Adam forfeited that Jesus said in
[48:18] Matthew 5 blessed are the meat for they
[48:19] shall inherit the see now we don't have
[48:21] it
[48:22] now and look it wasn't to Adam any of
[48:26] his seeds yeah
[48:29] right right right Adam planting a seed
[48:33] and Eve did not save her
[48:36] amen gee come on people Adam's seed
[48:40] absolutely lost everything right it's
[48:45] not the seed of
[48:47] Adam no matter how much we try to
[48:49] beautify this world and how much we try
[48:51] to make big fine homes and things it
[48:53] still doesn't belong to Adam seeve no
[48:56] sir it did not go to Adam's seed no sir
[48:59] because Satan took it locked stock in
[49:01] Barrel right for Adam forfeited it amen
[49:05] now number
[49:07] four the breach see Adam lost his
[49:11] inheritance the earth now it passed from
[49:13] his hand to the one he sold out to Satan
[49:17] he sold his faith in God
[49:22] right let's go back for a second Adam
[49:24] was a son of God right he had the mind
[49:27] of Christ he had the he had the Holy
[49:29] Ghost Inside of him he was God of the
[49:32] earth amen right Adam lost his
[49:35] inheritance the earth now it passed from
[49:37] his hand to the one he sold out to Satan
[49:39] right he sold his faith in God to
[49:41] Satan's reasoning therefore his eternal
[49:44] life his right to the Tree of Life his
[49:46] right to the Earth belonged to him and
[49:48] he forfeited it every bit to the hands
[49:51] of Satan he passed it from his hand to
[49:53] Satan therefore now it has been it
[49:56] returned and has been polluted listen to
[49:58] this and the seed of Adam
[50:01] natural not the spiritual seed of Adam
[50:04] the natural seed of Adam right has
[50:06] destroyed the inheritance that Adam
[50:09] should have had amen that's the Earth
[50:11] that's right see the seed of Adam now
[50:13] what happened the polluted seed of
[50:17] Adam there's only one original good seed
[50:20] that's the word of God Jesus Christ
[50:23] right so every other seed is perverted
[50:26] now what happened the polluted seed of
[50:28] Adam has polluted and absolutely
[50:31] destroyed the land do you know the Bible
[50:33] says that and because that he has did
[50:35] this the polluted seed of Adam God will
[50:38] destroy them amen but now
[50:41] listen remember Grace is something that
[50:45] you for something you've already done
[50:46] that's right now this is what I believe
[50:49] this is my
[50:51] belief Adam seeing what Eve done
[50:56] Eve was already
[50:58] polluted Eve was already
[51:01] ruined but she had a natural genetic
[51:04] seed placed in her by the Beast amen all
[51:08] right now go with me that
[51:11] far like I was telling brother Donnie
[51:13] the other Sunday this is what Adam did
[51:16] Adam said God I will accept what she's
[51:20] already done not what I'm fixing to do
[51:23] to her right right I've accepted what
[51:26] she's already
[51:29] done what did Jesus do he accepted what
[51:32] we've already
[51:34] done he was the first Adam and this is
[51:36] the second Adam right typing total type
[51:41] so Adam was saying God I will accept
[51:43] what she's already done so in accepting
[51:46] what she's already done he soole the
[51:49] human race out but now listen let me
[51:52] make sure I get this
[51:53] right he will
[51:57] willingly took on her sin yeah because
[52:01] there was no way because she had been
[52:03] naturally polluted naturally we're not
[52:06] talking spiritually now she has a
[52:07] natural genetic line in her womb
[52:12] right
[52:13] okay and it was polluted there's no way
[52:17] that a son and daughter of God can ever
[52:18] come from Eve anymore right
[52:24] but
[52:27] and there was not a way for her to
[52:28] actually get back into
[52:31] Adam wound was closed up amen there was
[52:35] no way for her to get back into her
[52:36] protector that's right so he could
[52:38] either kick her out and say God let her
[52:40] go I'll do it with another one but he
[52:41] couldn't do that he'd be killing a part
[52:44] of himself all right same way with Jesus
[52:51] Christ Adam's
[52:54] Act
[52:56] was to preserve his
[53:01] lineage think of
[53:05] that Adam just didn't have sex with her
[53:08] because it was nice and fun and all that
[53:12] stuff right
[53:15] right he knew that if he destroyed Eve
[53:18] and didn't do anything past what she had
[53:20] just done with the
[53:21] Beast his multiplying and replenishing
[53:24] the Earth we know he knew that in that
[53:26] he could do that in in
[53:28] spiritual but once he saw that the way
[53:31] was closed where he
[53:33] couldn't he couldn't do it spiritually
[53:35] anymore there was no Genesis 12627 going
[53:38] to come out of that amen right but
[53:40] Adam's natural
[53:43] lineage would have stopped if he hadn't
[53:46] went and took Eve and then did the act
[53:48] that he did now if you go that way with
[53:50] it I'll agree with you that he and I was
[53:52] telling brother join him that's why
[53:53] brother R said he took her quick quickly
[53:55] to himself why heet waited two or 3 days
[53:58] the womb would have been
[54:00] closed he would have been locked out
[54:02] people there was no other woman for him
[54:04] to have his lineage with right so he
[54:06] took that's the same way with Jesus
[54:08] Christ to carry on his Genesis 1:26-27
[54:10] he placed the spiritual seed right Amen
[54:14] to what declare his generation right so
[54:17] Adam the first Adam earthy remember
[54:20] everything Earth come from Adam Adam and
[54:23] Eve you understand what I'm saying right
[54:25] we know the Beast line was there but
[54:27] they call it Adam's race the Bible even
[54:29] calls it Adam's race this is the race of
[54:31] Adam without Adam coming to Eve and
[54:33] doing what he did there would not been a
[54:35] Abel a Seth an Abraham an Isaac a Jacob
[54:40] a Joseph right no uh right just keep
[54:43] naming them on down Thad there so Adam
[54:45] and Eve didn't get together just to have
[54:49] fun Adam was preserving his lineage
[54:52] right natural so he knew there was no
[54:55] spiritual way his lineage was going to
[54:56] come about there's no son and daughter
[54:59] of God ever going to be born from first
[55:00] Adam right not since what happened to
[55:02] Eve but if he did what he did Adam
[55:05] knowing he was a Son of God he knew he
[55:08] knew things God had to teach him things
[55:10] right right there wasn't nobody else to
[55:13] teach him there wasn't prophets we got
[55:14] prophets and and and scribes and people
[55:17] to teach there was nobody but Adam and
[55:19] God and Eve right and the
[55:21] devil right and the devil had pulled th
[55:24] pull one over on God but God didn't
[55:26] bother God because look if that act was
[55:30] so bad that Adam and Eve did with each
[55:32] other had the sex act then why did Abel
[55:35] get B I mean why did Seth get born and
[55:37] why did this one get born and why did
[55:39] this that's my point if that was so
[55:44] wrong God didn't destroy the sex act
[55:47] afterwards they started beginning to
[55:49] what multiply and replenish the Earth
[55:51] under a permissive will right right
[55:54] right
[55:55] God takes the book back from Adam which
[55:57] is the names of Genesis 126 and 27 only
[56:00] one came up that was Adam then Adam was
[56:04] supposed to bring everybody else right
[56:06] well when that got stopped God said hey
[56:08] that's okay right to be a redeemer I got
[56:11] to let something fall
[56:13] amen cuz it's called the Fallen race of
[56:16] Adam right so for Adam to propagate his
[56:19] species or to declare his generation he
[56:21] had to come to Eve do what he did to
[56:24] keep his lineage going because through
[56:26] all that lineage is our types and
[56:29] examples until Jesus Christ could come
[56:32] 2,000 years ago without any sex without
[56:35] any sperm and and EG from from
[56:38] parents to get us back amen right is
[56:41] that okay so everybody understands you
[56:44] know when people preach about Adam
[56:46] having to having to do this and inject
[56:47] his seat that wasn't to save
[56:50] Eve that's right that was actually Adam
[56:54] preserving his own
[56:56] lineage is that okay that all right he
[57:01] preserved his own lineage knowing though
[57:04] the the Christ that was in Adam Christ
[57:07] didn't leave Adam when he did that the
[57:09] mind of Christ was still there hey I
[57:12] can't get it this way anymore that's
[57:14] right but I got to get the people on the
[57:16] earth now cuz I'm fixing remember after
[57:18] all that happened first thing God done
[57:19] was curs the Earth right so when he
[57:21] cursed the Earth everything had to come
[57:23] up was cursed right right but it had to
[57:26] come up right there had to be a lineage
[57:29] does everybody understand is that okay I
[57:30] told you I was going to make sure we
[57:32] dwell on that point if you hear anybody
[57:33] say that Adam had inject his seed into
[57:36] Eve to save her it wasn't to save her it
[57:39] was to preserve his natural
[57:42] lineage knowing that God somewhere down
[57:44] in that lineage is going to come back
[57:47] through right right cuz remember Joseph
[57:51] and Mary was not a natural lineage of
[57:52] Jesus
[57:53] right but they were
[57:56] used they were used in lineage right
[57:58] natural lineages for our example all
[58:01] right till the one that
[58:04] come that was born without sin that was
[58:07] born without sex that was born without
[58:09] uh any sex act all right but the wom was
[58:12] already
[58:13] polluted Adam's Act was to preserve his
[58:16] lineage he had to do what he did having
[58:20] the mind of God he knew he had to we all
[58:22] had to come right
[58:25] all right remember brother said he knew
[58:27] what he was doing amen we just got to
[58:30] get the same mind of God to know what he
[58:32] was doing am not some silly sex act but
[58:35] to know that he was preserving our line
[58:39] to get us here in flesh amen cuz that's
[58:42] what God wanted he wanted us here in
[58:43] flesh Adam and Eve were going to bring
[58:45] us here in
[58:48] flesh but God was a redeemer yes so he
[58:52] had to let us follow he had to let that
[58:54] that happened right but did it stop
[58:57] God's purpose no he just dropped down in
[58:59] permissive well and allowed us to come
[59:01] the way we did
[59:06] right but a type but now look what did
[59:10] God do for both of them yeah he made a
[59:13] skin yeah for them he made an atonement
[59:18] blood made an atonement threw them into
[59:21] the GU into the into the bushes and said
[59:23] hey forget to figure
[59:25] Le put this on I'm going to cover more
[59:28] than just your bikinis that you got on
[59:30] in there you know your fig leaves yeah
[59:32] you need to have you need to all be
[59:34] covered cuz it started right here right
[59:36] right started from the
[59:38] mind but God made an offering or
[59:41] covering because there were no more sons
[59:43] of God to be born through flesh at that
[59:47] time right there's no more sons of God
[59:50] I'm talking about eternal Genesis 126
[59:53] born again could not come through that
[59:56] right right caus in Adam all die
[1:00:00] amen right right so God brought a group
[1:00:04] of
[1:00:06] people into the Earth let's go to
[1:00:10] Genesis
[1:00:12] 3 15 let's just read that just make
[1:00:15] sure see I will put eny your division
[1:00:18] between thee and the woman who's Thee
[1:00:20] the Beast right and the woman and
[1:00:23] between thy seed be seed right right
[1:00:26] right and her
[1:00:29] seed now woman don't have a
[1:00:31] seed so there's Christ saying that I'm
[1:00:35] going to separate this thing I know
[1:00:37] we're going to have to come in flesh but
[1:00:39] I'm going to come down and give her a
[1:00:42] seed seed right right seed and and you
[1:00:45] know the whole thing amen the whole
[1:00:47] thing's a
[1:00:48] seed okay and it shall bruise thy
[1:00:52] head serpent yeah and thou shalt bruise
[1:00:56] his heel well if you kick somebody in
[1:00:57] the heel it's not going to hurt him you
[1:00:58] take cut the heel off but it what her
[1:01:01] seed shall bruise thy head you cut the
[1:01:04] head off and you're going to kill it
[1:01:05] right and unto the woman he said I will
[1:01:08] greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
[1:01:11] conception and in sorrow Thou shalt
[1:01:13] bring forth children and thy desire
[1:01:14] shall be to thy husband remember we
[1:01:16] talked about the double Covenant that
[1:01:17] now the double Covenant in the man is
[1:01:19] the man's going to rule over right and
[1:01:21] he shall rule over thee and into Adam
[1:01:23] because thou has hearkened under the
[1:01:25] voice of thy wife and has eaten of the
[1:01:27] tree of which I commanded thee saying
[1:01:28] Thou shalt not eat cursed is the ground
[1:01:31] now he didn't curse Adam right he cursed
[1:01:33] the ground in sorrow shalt th eat of it
[1:01:36] all the days of thy life thorns and F
[1:01:38] shall it bring forth to thee Thou shalt
[1:01:40] eat the herb of the field sweat of thy
[1:01:42] face shall th eat bread till thou return
[1:01:45] unto the ground for out of it was you
[1:01:48] taken for dust Thou Art and to dust Thou
[1:01:50] shalt return and Adam called his wife
[1:01:53] name Eve because she was the mother of
[1:01:56] all living now here she got her name now
[1:01:59] let's go to Genesis 5 genesis 5 verse
[1:02:03] one see look this is the book of the
[1:02:06] generations of Adam there would not have
[1:02:09] been this book there would not have been
[1:02:12] this generation of Adam had he not done
[1:02:15] what he did with Eve after the Beast did
[1:02:16] what he did with Eve right right that's
[1:02:19] where the twins come right this is the
[1:02:22] book of the generations of
[1:02:25] Adam now remember and Adam all died so
[1:02:27] that's what happened in the day that God
[1:02:30] created man in the likeness of God made
[1:02:32] he him now look male female created to
[1:02:35] them he's going right back to Genesis
[1:02:37] 126 and blessed them and called their
[1:02:39] name Adam for the fall they were both
[1:02:42] named Adam in the day when they were
[1:02:45] created and Adam lived 130 years and
[1:02:48] begot a son in his own likeness after
[1:02:51] his
[1:02:52] image a natural boy
[1:02:55] called his name Seth so there you start
[1:02:58] the natural lineage of Adam
[1:03:00] correct all right Abel was killed so
[1:03:03] remember when you look in the Bible just
[1:03:04] for a turn let's go to L Luke 3 when you
[1:03:08] look in the natural to be a to have a
[1:03:09] lineage or line you got to have
[1:03:11] propagated your species right or sent
[1:03:14] your genealogy down to the Next
[1:03:17] Generation right what I was telling them
[1:03:19] up in U up in Virginia right there where
[1:03:22] brother Ron and all them there was
[1:03:23] probably
[1:03:25] 200 Civil War battles fought right in
[1:03:27] from where he you know 100 miles from
[1:03:29] where he was at I said could you imagine
[1:03:31] 600,000 men were killed in the Civil War
[1:03:35] in 4 years 600,000 men there was 600,000
[1:03:38] Generations stopped if they had not had
[1:03:42] children a lot of them were young boys
[1:03:43] remember a lot of them were young boys
[1:03:45] fighting now if they were older men and
[1:03:46] had children but just think how many
[1:03:48] were young boys that that generation
[1:03:50] stopped but God preserved somebody
[1:03:54] stayed alive to get us here cuz we're
[1:03:56] all from that line except you move from
[1:04:00] the south I'm going move from the north
[1:04:01] which bless your heart that you got
[1:04:04] here
[1:04:08] so all right Luke 3 but that was that's
[1:04:11] the God he had to have a natural lineage
[1:04:15] right cuz he was going to put Genesis
[1:04:18] 1:26 lineage into a human flesh right
[1:04:22] right that's what he did right so he was
[1:04:24] going to do the same thing to you right
[1:04:26] cuz that's the way you come you didn't
[1:04:28] come a spirit baby right you come a
[1:04:30] natural baby right which was the son of
[1:04:32] Canaan which was the son of whatever
[1:04:34] that name is which was the son of sham
[1:04:37] which was the son of Noah which was the
[1:04:38] son of lamic which was the son of
[1:04:40] Methuselah which was the son of Enoch
[1:04:42] which was the son of Jared which was the
[1:04:44] son of Mal which was the son of Canan
[1:04:47] which was the son of enus which was the
[1:04:48] son of Seth which was the son of Adam
[1:04:51] which was the son of God right so he was
[1:04:53] the son of God for the for the Old
[1:04:55] Testament right the only one that had
[1:04:57] eternal life to be a Son of God in the
[1:05:00] lineage right right all right you got
[1:05:03] that which was the son of enus which was
[1:05:05] the son of Seth which was the son of
[1:05:06] Adam which was the son of God all right
[1:05:08] everybody got that yes so Adam was a Son
[1:05:11] of God glory amen all right but this is
[1:05:15] a natural lineage of natural
[1:05:17] people same way in the Old Testament
[1:05:20] from Seth to Joseph there were
[1:05:23] generation but not sons of God I'm
[1:05:26] talking about Joseph what what this do
[1:05:28] if you what this do what this do does if
[1:05:30] you go backwards through Luke it starts
[1:05:34] with Joseph wasn't the son of what
[1:05:36] Joseph was not the father of Jesus but
[1:05:38] it comes down through Joseph line right
[1:05:40] but it's showing a natural Li lineage
[1:05:42] coming back to the beginning of time
[1:05:44] right right straight down to Jesus if
[1:05:45] you'll read it back
[1:05:47] right so Adam had preserved his lineage
[1:05:51] yeah right there it was he preserve that
[1:05:54] lineage all the way to
[1:05:56] Joseph all the way to today
[1:05:59] actually but they were not any of them
[1:06:02] Genesis 1:26 none of these enus Seth Mal
[1:06:07] Jared go all the way up to Joseph they
[1:06:10] were not sons of God by
[1:06:12] birth right they were not Adam which was
[1:06:16] the son of God right so
[1:06:19] now but
[1:06:21] remember from this all we get natural
[1:06:24] lineages not spiritual L lineages right
[1:06:27] the only time you see a spoken word
[1:06:30] child is on the day of
[1:06:36] Pentecost that's when the book became
[1:06:38] open again exactly all right that's when
[1:06:40] the book became right into the rightful
[1:06:41] owner which Jesus was the book Jesus
[1:06:44] held the book while he was here on Earth
[1:06:45] and we'll go through that in just a
[1:06:47] minute so we're going to walk you
[1:06:49] through this who shall declare because
[1:06:51] remember Jesus natural Jesus
[1:06:54] When They Crucified him a couple of days
[1:06:56] ago 2,000 years ago on a cross he never
[1:06:59] had children so that stopped his natural
[1:07:02] genetic
[1:07:03] lineage amen who shall declare his
[1:07:08] genation right his
[1:07:11] genealogy he had no earthly genealogy as
[1:07:13] far as this right here was going none
[1:07:17] right Adam shouldn't have really except
[1:07:21] the Genesis 126 and 27 people that's all
[1:07:24] he should have had right but by
[1:07:27] permissive will he has allowed all this
[1:07:29] Old Testament turn to First Corinthians
[1:07:33] 10 verse 11 now all these things read
[1:07:37] the rest of the scripture but I I like
[1:07:39] to use this because all these Old
[1:07:41] Testament things all these
[1:07:43] things happened unto them for examples
[1:07:47] right and they are written for
[1:07:51] our our admonition who upon whom the
[1:07:55] ends of the world are
[1:07:57] come so baby do let me tell you
[1:08:00] something that's me and you in the
[1:08:02] scripture there's nobody else there's
[1:08:05] not another one to come there's not
[1:08:06] another one pass if you can't read that
[1:08:09] you're dead you understand what I mean
[1:08:11] if you're in the grave you can't fulfill
[1:08:13] this but you are alive you are a
[1:08:17] genealogy you are written these things
[1:08:19] are written for our admonition what
[1:08:22] Abraham Isa
[1:08:24] Jacob Joseph were examples of
[1:08:27] Christianity not Christianity examples
[1:08:30] of Christianity examples of the way
[1:08:33] we're supposed to live upon whom the
[1:08:36] ends of the world are come so that's me
[1:08:38] and
[1:08:39] you so they were all given for examples
[1:08:42] every bit of this was given for our
[1:08:44] example whom the ends of the world have
[1:08:46] Came
[1:08:49] Upon Psalms
[1:08:52] 139
[1:08:55] now this is David but listen to what
[1:08:57] this
[1:08:58] says put your name in here yeah for thou
[1:09:01] H has possessed my reign right thou Hast
[1:09:04] covered me in my mother's womb I will
[1:09:07] praise thee for I am Filly and
[1:09:10] wonderfully
[1:09:11] made marvelous are thy
[1:09:14] works and that my soul knoweth right
[1:09:17] well my substance was not hid from
[1:09:20] thee that's right f 5 4 years 53 years
[1:09:25] ago I wasn't in existence
[1:09:28] right but God knew who I was amen God
[1:09:31] knew when I was coming right all right
[1:09:33] that's what I was telling them we were
[1:09:35] sitting at a at a at a high school um I
[1:09:38] think Hope was
[1:09:39] graduating and I looked around and all
[1:09:41] the guys that went to school with me a
[1:09:43] lot of them were there and I told them I
[1:09:45] said you know what I said about 70% of
[1:09:48] the people in this Stadium wasn't even
[1:09:49] born when we were in school they weren't
[1:09:51] even alive yeah where' they come from
[1:09:55] yeah genealogy right right genealogy
[1:10:00] they
[1:10:01] appear my substance was not hid from
[1:10:04] thee when I was made in secret and
[1:10:07] curiously WR in the lowest parts of the
[1:10:09] earth Thine Eyes did see my substance
[1:10:13] yet being unperfect
[1:10:17] flesh and in thy
[1:10:20] book all my members were written so he
[1:10:24] he he did see my substance what I was
[1:10:26] coming to right here but in thy book all
[1:10:29] my members were written which in
[1:10:31] continuent what's the continuance mean
[1:10:34] one right after the other and
[1:10:36] continuance were fashion when as yet
[1:10:39] there was none of them right that's
[1:10:41] right God didn't go on vacation when
[1:10:43] Adam and Eve did what they did in the
[1:10:45] garden that's no he just went right on
[1:10:48] making examples of the Old Testament
[1:10:50] people covering their sins by the blood
[1:10:52] of a lamb that didn't have a soul so the
[1:10:56] soul of man the soul of almighty God was
[1:10:59] not in those animals amen that's right
[1:11:02] that's why they had to just be covered
[1:11:04] right right they were just
[1:11:07] covered but look how powerful they were
[1:11:09] in just the covering of
[1:11:11] lamb all
[1:11:17] right in continuance you and I had to
[1:11:21] come because Genesis 1:26 27 was still
[1:11:24] sitting in the mind of God yeah right he
[1:11:26] was still holding the book it you know
[1:11:28] it went back the book went back to the
[1:11:30] original owner Satan's a squat on this
[1:11:32] Earth he's just here for a time but the
[1:11:34] original the book The Genesis 1226 the
[1:11:37] book of names yeah God's holding it he's
[1:11:40] the only one that can produce it that's
[1:11:43] why it took a lamb to produce the book
[1:11:45] it took a lamb to bring that book
[1:11:46] forward why that lamb that book was a
[1:11:48] part of the Lamb that's right all right
[1:11:51] all right so
[1:11:52] now Isaiah
[1:11:54] 53 verse
[1:11:58] 10 now see yet it plead we didn't read
[1:12:01] we stopped at verse eight for for on
[1:12:04] purpose verse 10 yet it pleased the Lord
[1:12:07] to bruise him he have put him to grief
[1:12:10] when thou shalt make his soul see you
[1:12:13] can't make the soul of an animal an
[1:12:14] offering for sin that's why in the Old
[1:12:16] Testament you couldn't have the soul of
[1:12:18] God in any
[1:12:21] individual couldn't that's right right
[1:12:24] just a covering
[1:12:28] right but but Isaiah 53 says when thou
[1:12:32] shalt make his soul an offering for sin
[1:12:35] y right here he shall see his seed
[1:12:39] righten Genesis 1 126 and 27 right right
[1:12:43] right he shall prolong his days and the
[1:12:44] pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in
[1:12:46] his hand we'll read the rest of it in a
[1:12:47] little while but right there Isaiah
[1:12:50] 53 who shall declare his generation that
[1:12:53] was in verse 8 right well Isaiah is
[1:12:56] telling you really in between the love
[1:12:58] letter here he's writing he's telling us
[1:13:00] that he's going to bring
[1:13:01] us when he himself when Jesus Christ
[1:13:05] himself comes and makes an offering for
[1:13:07] sin he shall see his seed Glory why
[1:13:10] because the seed was inside of him not
[1:13:14] some little spot you
[1:13:16] can't the the seed that produced Josh
[1:13:18] you couldn't find it in my body
[1:13:20] chemically you couldn't look for it
[1:13:22] until it went to its place everybody
[1:13:25] understand that you couldn't so so you
[1:13:27] don't say well I was that no but we have
[1:13:29] to know our position we're the body of
[1:13:30] Jesus Christ so we have to know what
[1:13:32] position we're in right but you don't
[1:13:34] have to say well he shall see his seed
[1:13:37] well who was his seed Genesis 12627
[1:13:40] that's the only seed of
[1:13:41] God Galatians 3:16 and thy seed which is
[1:13:46] Christ Not seeds right that's right not
[1:13:49] Abraham planting seeds in women not
[1:13:52] Isaac plant seeds Abraham planting all
[1:13:55] uhuh thy seed singular Christ that seed
[1:14:00] never come from the loins of a human man
[1:14:02] amen exactly it came from the mind of
[1:14:05] almighty God spoken remember it has to
[1:14:07] be a thought before it's spoken yes he
[1:14:09] thought of us and then spoke
[1:14:12] us but now
[1:14:16] look let's go to Galatians 3 and just
[1:14:19] read
[1:14:21] that now the Abraham and his seed were
[1:14:24] the promises made right he saith not to
[1:14:27] seeds as of many but as of one and to
[1:14:31] thy seed which is Christ amen you and I
[1:14:36] have a
[1:14:37] promise we're not Abraham's promis seed
[1:14:40] by natural
[1:14:42] genetics right if you if some of you
[1:14:45] have not been going to brother Bob black
[1:14:47] class you need to go you need to listen
[1:14:50] to it because he's taken from Genesis
[1:14:52] about five four and five where we just
[1:14:55] started at and he's taking lineages and
[1:14:57] showing you that lineages really if you
[1:14:59] break them down in the Old Testament
[1:15:02] they don't mean nothing that's right you
[1:15:04] start bringing in Rahab and Ruth and
[1:15:09] this one and that one and this one and
[1:15:11] that one you'd think boy that thing
[1:15:13] comes right straight down like they want
[1:15:14] to preach you know you got Adams line
[1:15:17] over here well Adam's line over here is
[1:15:19] just as polluted as the Beast line I
[1:15:21] just proved that right there's no
[1:15:24] difference in Adam's natural seed and
[1:15:26] the beast's natural
[1:15:28] seed none they all come perverted
[1:15:31] polluted dead nothing alive in it oh
[1:15:35] yeah we're
[1:15:37] alive no if you don't have Christ you're
[1:15:39] dead Okay and that's the seed we're
[1:15:42] looking at and that's the seed like
[1:15:45] brother Daniel was talking about
[1:15:46] Wednesday night Jesus said a little
[1:15:49] while the world see me no
[1:15:50] more I may stop here and and finish this
[1:15:53] afternoon may go maybe a few more
[1:15:55] minutes but that
[1:15:58] Resurrection started inside the
[1:16:03] Earth the stone was not rolled away when
[1:16:07] Jesus came out of the
[1:16:11] Grave we it the stone was still there
[1:16:16] the angel rolled it rolled it away we
[1:16:18] read it last night in the Bible study
[1:16:20] you did it's St the angel
[1:16:24] rolled it away and sat down and said who
[1:16:25] are you looking
[1:16:26] for that's right Jesus didn't need to
[1:16:30] move that thing the resurrection started
[1:16:32] when it quickened that
[1:16:34] body and he just walked right straight
[1:16:36] through that that rock and didn't matter
[1:16:39] is a million miles thick we'll read it
[1:16:42] we'll read it tonight there this
[1:16:44] afternoon but now look let's go back in
[1:16:48] the Old Testament cuz we can't do away
[1:16:50] with
[1:16:51] Israel cuz God loved Israel
[1:16:55] right he called him his children he
[1:16:57] called him his bride I was telling I was
[1:16:59] telling him somebody the other day I was
[1:17:01] telling the guys at work the reason they
[1:17:03] were called the children of Israel cuz
[1:17:06] they acted like children yeah that's
[1:17:08] right that's the reason they were called
[1:17:10] the children of Israel they acted like
[1:17:12] kids they never weren
[1:17:13] grownups they never grew up they always
[1:17:17] murmured and complained and wanted these
[1:17:19] social social
[1:17:22] programs and God gave it to them and
[1:17:25] they still murmured and complained
[1:17:26] that's babies that's not full grown
[1:17:29] adults children that never grew to
[1:17:32] maturity right but remember he put
[1:17:34] Israel away for her
[1:17:37] defilement right right he put her away
[1:17:39] for their for their
[1:17:41] defilement but Daniel 9 what we read
[1:17:44] proves that he's going to restore Israel
[1:17:46] to a position not to wife
[1:17:49] again not to his genetic children
[1:17:53] cuz remember they had all those tribes
[1:17:55] in lineages and they had all this in L
[1:17:57] that was natural every bit of that was
[1:18:00] natural there wasn't a supernatural act
[1:18:02] in the Old
[1:18:06] Testament even though um Samuel's mother
[1:18:10] Hannah was old she still had relations
[1:18:13] with her husband to get Samuel H right
[1:18:15] and there wasn't an Immaculate
[1:18:17] Conception in the Old Testament is what
[1:18:18] I'm trying to say okay everything was
[1:18:20] done by going into your wife
[1:18:24] okay or them going into the husband so
[1:18:26] Daniel 9 proves that he's going to
[1:18:28] restore her to a position she was cut
[1:18:30] off because of you and I
[1:18:35] right he's going to declare his
[1:18:37] generation here right but he's going to
[1:18:40] also declare his spiritual generation
[1:18:42] right yes which is you and I amen you
[1:18:45] and I are his spiritual genetics we all
[1:18:49] come from all different natural genetic
[1:18:51] lines but we we all have one spiritual
[1:18:54] Gene right right and it's woven into us
[1:18:58] like Daniel that was good brother I
[1:19:00] appreciate that you doing a good job I'm
[1:19:03] honored a good job cuz that really
[1:19:05] sparked something in me because that
[1:19:07] spirit that raised up Jesus from the
[1:19:09] dead right will also Quicken your mortal
[1:19:12] body but what did that Spirit do when
[1:19:13] that Spirit went back in the body and
[1:19:15] we'll cover that this
[1:19:16] afternoon but when that Spirit went back
[1:19:19] into that body it
[1:19:20] quickened that body that was beat like
[1:19:23] hamburger meat his bones weren't broken
[1:19:26] but he had gashes and lashes and all he
[1:19:28] was wounded for our transgression he was
[1:19:30] bruised for our iniquity that's the
[1:19:31] outside this is for this guy yeah where
[1:19:34] he really done the
[1:19:36] damage is he gave his soul amen a ransom
[1:19:41] so he could see a se you could have beat
[1:19:43] this body you could have beat that body
[1:19:45] of Jesus almost to death but he was in
[1:19:47] full control of that situation Jesus
[1:19:51] Christ knew that we were going to be
[1:19:52] bruised and battered and we needed
[1:19:54] healing in our body right right but when
[1:19:57] he gave his soul Ransom when he gave
[1:20:00] himself up because of our
[1:20:02] sin what did he say he gave his soul a
[1:20:06] ransom so that he could see his SE in
[1:20:08] other words you he paid for something he
[1:20:12] ransomed our soul out of hell he
[1:20:14] ransomed our soul from Adam's race
[1:20:17] Fallen dead on our way to hell and put
[1:20:19] us into his race right into his kingdom
[1:20:23] all right and we'll see that this
[1:20:25] afternoon how did what did Jesus
[1:20:28] do Jesus
[1:20:30] came with the genealogy in
[1:20:34] him right he brought his own genetics
[1:20:37] amen he didn't depend on nobody else I
[1:20:40] don't depend on nobody else to have my
[1:20:42] kids comes from me right right and if
[1:20:46] there're my kids I put them in my family
[1:20:48] album I love your kids but I don't have
[1:20:50] them all over the country I mean all
[1:20:52] over my house in a family album I got my
[1:20:54] kidss in the family album that's right
[1:20:55] and that's the same way with Jesus
[1:20:57] Christ he did the same thing you love
[1:20:58] the Lord let's go to one more scripture
[1:21:00] let's go to First Timothy before we
[1:21:02] finish because
[1:21:04] look we're going to talk about the
[1:21:07] law because the law was given because of
[1:21:10] our
[1:21:11] transgression right okay so we're going
[1:21:14] to talk about this the law this
[1:21:15] afternoon but how the law and the
[1:21:17] prophets built the body of Christ and
[1:21:19] we'll come on into where Jesus comes up
[1:21:21] and that's why
[1:21:23] we're going to talk about today this is
[1:21:25] his this is the resurrection right right
[1:21:28] the only way that he could declare his
[1:21:30] generation was to come out of that grave
[1:21:33] amen exactly cuz he was cut off among
[1:21:35] the land of the living I hope everybody
[1:21:37] caught that this is this is a
[1:21:38] resurrection message he had is they they
[1:21:42] tried to put that great big they trying
[1:21:44] to put that great big rock up there to
[1:21:47] stop his genealogy if they could have
[1:21:49] stopped him from coming out of the Grave
[1:21:50] we were gone we were done we were
[1:21:53] finished right but see they were looking
[1:21:55] at the natural
[1:21:56] man God's looking at the spiritual man
[1:21:59] that went to hell preach of the souls in
[1:22:01] prison come and pick that body up in in
[1:22:03] other words change that body now left
[1:22:05] the scars for the nail
[1:22:07] prints but remember he was beat all to
[1:22:10] pieces he was bruised for our iniquity
[1:22:13] all that bruising was gone when mayor
[1:22:15] Magdalene made him in the garden she
[1:22:17] thought he was a gardener a young boy
[1:22:19] but when he said Mary for every cre of
[1:22:23] God is good and nothing to be refused if
[1:22:25] it be received with Thanksgiving for it
[1:22:28] is Sanctified by the word of God in
[1:22:29] prayers why don't you should pray before
[1:22:30] you eat anything if thou put the
[1:22:32] brethren in remembrance of these things
[1:22:34] Thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus
[1:22:36] Christ nourished up in the words of
[1:22:38] faith and good Doctrine where unto thou
[1:22:39] has attained but refuse refuse profane
[1:22:43] and old wies fables exercise thyself
[1:22:45] rather unto godliness for bodily
[1:22:47] exercise profiteth little but godliness
[1:22:51] is profitable unto all all things having
[1:22:54] promise of the life that now
[1:22:56] is and that which is to come this is a
[1:23:00] faithful saying and worthy of accept
[1:23:03] acceptation for therefore we both labor
[1:23:06] and suffer reproach because we trust in
[1:23:08] the Living God who is the savior of all
[1:23:11] men especially of those that believe all
[1:23:16] right everybody got that right everybody
[1:23:19] the ones that
[1:23:21] believe
[1:23:23] now Paul said he was scared of Our
[1:23:26] Endless genealogy right but how God has
[1:23:29] took us and told us that that have a
[1:23:31] promise of life that now is and that
[1:23:33] which is to
[1:23:34] come now look let's go to quote number
[1:23:38] five let's let's do that one then we'll
[1:23:39] then we'll stop right
[1:23:41] there the law was given because of man's
[1:23:43] transgression we know that right that's
[1:23:45] right Israel man wanted a law to live by
[1:23:50] the blood of animals with a sacrifice
[1:23:52] covering an
[1:23:53] atonement but what was the curse of the
[1:23:55] law what was the curse of the law right
[1:23:58] nobody could live it amen nobody could
[1:24:00] live it they wanted the law and then it
[1:24:02] couldn't even abide by it right all
[1:24:04] right now
[1:24:06] look Perfection we'll stop right here
[1:24:09] now when Adam and Eve had sinned let's
[1:24:10] read the whole thing there was no way no
[1:24:12] other remedy that they could ever stand
[1:24:15] in the presence of God again except this
[1:24:17] sin be dealt with right and no man can
[1:24:21] commit a sin of anything type no matter
[1:24:23] how little or how big that individual
[1:24:25] sin has to be dealt with before the one
[1:24:27] who committed it can ever stand in the
[1:24:29] presence of the holy God so therefore
[1:24:32] when Adam and Eve had sinned and had
[1:24:33] transgressed the law they were subjects
[1:24:36] of death and the law had to be executed
[1:24:40] therefore it put all the human race
[1:24:42] under the penalty of death now if we can
[1:24:45] only settle down for a few moments now
[1:24:46] in our thinking and look at this great
[1:24:48] picture and remember that every person
[1:24:51] here is included in this
[1:24:53] amen right right every man and woman
[1:24:56] child is included in the penalty of
[1:24:58] death by the transgression of the head
[1:25:01] of the human race
[1:25:03] Adam by his transgression every one of
[1:25:07] us fell victim to sin amen and sin must
[1:25:11] be dealt with and so God in his great
[1:25:14] infiny and his great love the law was to
[1:25:17] separate the sinner from his maker amen
[1:25:21] then he became Anil and totally
[1:25:22] annihilated there would be no way for
[1:25:24] him to ever come back unless that sin
[1:25:26] was dealt with and it would be very easy
[1:25:29] then to believe in a total annihilation
[1:25:31] of The Sinner at the end for he is
[1:25:33] completely forever separated from the
[1:25:35] presence of God all right so that kind
[1:25:37] of explains all that but sin must be
[1:25:40] dealt with sin had to be dealt with in a
[1:25:42] different way than Adam and Eve tried to
[1:25:44] deal with
[1:25:45] right and even Abraham and Isaac and
[1:25:48] Jacob they dealt with sin as in they
[1:25:50] give an atonement they give a covering
[1:25:52] we're covered we're covered we're
[1:25:54] covered but just being covered someday
[1:25:57] you got to stand in front of all that
[1:25:59] right cuz it's just being covered it's
[1:26:01] not being done away with that's right a
[1:26:04] lot of you young ones coming up in the
[1:26:06] Lord you sin's got to be dealt with it
[1:26:08] cannot be covered it's got to be dealt
[1:26:10] with amen and it takes what one man
[1:26:14] could do it and that's Jesus Christ he's
[1:26:17] the one that took the sin down away
[1:26:19] because he had a soul that sacrifice for
[1:26:24] you had a soul let's stand our
[1:26:29] feet and for that Soul coming out of
[1:26:32] that grave bringing the body with it
[1:26:35] took all of us and cleaned us up
[1:26:39] amen he was wounded for our
[1:26:41] transgression right he was bruised for
[1:26:44] our iniquity the chastisement of his GL
[1:26:47] peace our peace was upon him and with
[1:26:49] his stripes we are healed amen he was
[1:26:53] taken from prison and from judgment who
[1:26:54] shall declare his generation amen for he
[1:26:57] was cut off out of the land of the
[1:26:58] living for the transgression of my
[1:27:00] people was he stricken right and he made
[1:27:02] his grave with the wicked and with the
[1:27:04] rich and his death amen because he had
[1:27:06] done no violence neither was any deceit
[1:27:09] in his mouth yet it pleased the Lord to
[1:27:11] bruise him Heath put him to grief when
[1:27:13] thou shalt make his soul an offering for
[1:27:16] sin he shall see his seed amen he shall
[1:27:19] prolong his days and the pleasure of the
[1:27:21] Lord shall Pro in his hand right he
[1:27:23] shall see of the travail of his soul and
[1:27:26] shall be
[1:27:27] satisfied on the cross he was travailing
[1:27:30] in body obviously but he was travailing
[1:27:33] in Soul because he had to all scripture
[1:27:36] had to be fulfilled you and I were
[1:27:38] hanging in the
[1:27:40] balances we were inside of him there was
[1:27:43] no way for us to get out we were inside
[1:27:46] of that man Jesus Christ no way to get
[1:27:48] out unless that Soul came out of that
[1:27:51] body amen and went and paid a price and
[1:27:55] come back and brought that body back he
[1:27:57] shall see the travail of his soul and
[1:27:59] shall be satisfied for his knowledge
[1:28:02] shall my righteous servant justify many
[1:28:05] for he shall bear their iniquity amen
[1:28:09] therefore will I divide him a portion
[1:28:11] with the great and he shall divide the
[1:28:13] spoil with the strong because he ha
[1:28:15] poured out his soul unto death now you
[1:28:18] can't kill a soul but a soul he poured
[1:28:20] out his soul unto death the body
[1:28:23] died the body died the soul didn't die
[1:28:26] the body died but the body paid the
[1:28:27] price soul went paid the price in Hell
[1:28:30] the body took our Stripes took our
[1:28:33] bruises took our iniquity something you
[1:28:36] could see see because Adam's race was
[1:28:39] broken Adam's natural race was done for
[1:28:43] exactly all that was rotten remember in
[1:28:46] David he said I'll not leave my Holy One
[1:28:48] see corruption right that's right not
