TRANSCRIPT
========================================
for next Sunday all right let's go and go back to where we were last Sunday to DQ oh just for a moment and we'll move on with this I hope knit though you weren't here last Sunday you need to listen to that portion that we did right so we have a good background that was to me that was real vital for understanding who the son of man he is not was is okay all right so we're going to go to Ezekiel to where Nikki oh 2 verse 1 says and said unto me son of man so there's the capital S stand up on that beach sure he's talking to Ezekiel but once he's going to be he's going to speak under these over to the twos come together then in verse 2 then 2 / 6 it says and thou son of man being on a friend so he's talking some directed them to Ezekiel all right first time he's speaking through his heat you ly son the son of man all right now we know the text prefigure because Jesus was the son of man he was not in a flash body yet though but it was white the Old Testaments given for what hides and shadows right that's what the old Tessa was given for there was a the whole Old Testament is like Modell's it's a parable the whole Old Testament is the total lives of people who are going to read in a minute about the sort of the seed that's a parable but it is a living thing I mean they live ezekiel went through that Old Testament but he wasn't beast on a man he really wasn't a son of man in the extent he had Holy Ghost installed right but God was prophesied to him and through him you got that to him and through him showing to me if you take the Book of Ezekiel he goes all the way remember when zekiel 42 44 millennium temple so Ezekiel takes takes you all the way from from the Son of Man revelation they're talking about when we raided last Sunday talking about one did upon the lightness of the throne was the likeness is the appearance of a man above it and verse 26 alright still we see that he speaks all that about the son of man he's talking about a man now remember we took the four beasts last week we took the form is no weapon disease will say the 4 p's had the lightness of land alright so it's for combat beef working through a man alright but it was not the for combat beats working through Ezekiel in the sense that Ezekiel had an indwelling of the Holy Ghost and then those for combat beasts were helping him know he was he was an Old Testament prophet but he wasn't a born-again believer so but when he done though was he yielded itself so much to God that God could use it right alright so we don't we don't belittle a zekiel I don't I don't want anybody to thank even when I think the problem the problem from Bethlehem is tail the problem with the problem with a lot of people when you look at it people in the message they they sell well they gotta have the Holy Ghost they're so powerful a group of people in the Old Testament that's one you know brother told me Abraham had to be a born-again I said show me in the Bible and I even took him to over there like and the New Testament where they called him a friend of God not even child of God Abraham with a friend of God God couldn't get inside that man alright because what happened was it all that was bound up after Adam sinned all that was bound up in what Sonny God all the revelation of the Son of Man and even in son of David was taken away from adam meister about that this morning Adam Adam lost like what we're talking about today talking about stairs Adam lost the ability to bring any of this to pass after he failed all right now he was a sunny guy remember the Bible you go over in Luke Luke calls him a son of God so that's what you don't want with Sonny gun because God was dwelling in Seoul the only man in the Old Testament but now he's easy when Abraham and all those people built the foundation built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets so we can't do away with the foundation we can't make the foundation not of God and then the building of God that the foundation was of God Ezekiel Isaiah Jeremiah all those great prophets but they were all speaking of what they were all prophesizing him something to come number one on my side number two you and I all right because full restoration thank you they weren't restored they really had more revelation of people in the message they know they need restoration they knew they cried out David cried out my soul thirsteth after they all those things you know that David did in the flesh he was so close to God till he knew he shouldn't be doing that right he knew he shouldn't be done but yet he did it anyway because the flesh took over and the Son of God was not dwelling in his soul to do what take that desire way think everything out you know but they what they are considered in the part of redemption is being prophets bringing us to that that's why Ezekiel got on there that's correct that's right that's just like God I see God will honor a prosecutor a God will honor anybody's faith all right anybody it's like brother Dale saying what about Abraham what about a man it just was sitting in his house all comfy and cozy selling aisles and had all this family around him and he thought man this is good and one day he just hears a voice that says Abram get up get your family and move where am I going I just get ugly get only you don't need to be here get up and leave what great faith is that right right that's the one with Ezekiel I believe when his ego saw all these visions listen it's just like me and you things don't leave you my brother branham things didn't leave him when you have a vision things but those things but he said it still bothers means there are times when you have these needs two things still buy one human being Ezekiel Ezekiel in his writings was showing that there's a son of man going to show up on this earth and actually is the fuel if you'll read through all those eco tells how happened that's going to happen because watching chapter 3 we've covered it last week so I'm am eat that now find its eat this role now remember their workbooks back then there were scrolls or rolls there was no such thing as a book Kathy when the book it was a role that piece of paper so even as he kill he's not saying eat this book but yet he is sandy this book just like John now when you come down to John his comp they begin to start putting things in the book all right eat this role and go speaking to where the house of Israel so all over my mouth it caused me to eat that role now remember I told you last week he cost me to eat the role who the angel or whoever he's talking to you you say the angel the Lord and God or whatever you want to say Jovah angel done he caused me to eat the rope now John being born again Christian that desire in his heart said give me the book or giving me the rope in other words you got it you got to have something to do you gotta have something you don't have something to do with you gotta go get it all right that's what brother Dale's cover and I hope he covers more and more about the unconditional covenant I'm sure Genesis 126 man there was never Covenant made with that man when God put the 126 man into the 27 man he made a covenant lat they let go do's and don'ts in that Genesis 126 man you do this don't do that no when he put out of in flesh he took at him and made him a person then he put that 1.6 man in God wasn't talking to the 126 man when he said do this and don't do that hope he goes through how was that because that he was talking to Adam this human part of Adam because remember the 1.6 man you gotta understand this that never failed it never will fall never had if it has one speck of any fall or sin to it see so there's no unconditional coming that's why I may be covering something for him but that's why bow and I want you to think about so when you go upstairs you're painting up wander off somewhere that's why the unconditional covenant is not eternal when we go back to the 126 man we only each other right hello when we go back to that 122nd a way to come right we need to cover them when we come through the filter of the fog we were here and we come down into followed man that's when you need a covenant color covenant is between what two people right you and God do this don't do that then the unconditional covenant he's talking of the children of God there's a children of God Genesis 1 Quincy all right so jess is 126 made never felt when I talk about Genesis 126 man even when we come down and talking about Ezekiel Ezekiel was a part of that Genesis 1 26 min no no he's he's considered in Redemption he got he was saved by his faith but he's not a child of God he's not a son and daughter of god Adam was because he had he curl up in his soul I don't think some of us are getting that but maybe as we keep going on off your eyes now we can get it well Jesus had to 126 man inside of it remember he gave part of it Diana then he said Adam in other words he give out of that role brother Reynolds said Adam Eve was supposed to produce the body for Jesus whatever hell they was supposed to come we were just supposed to come that role is what that role is this with your name in it right so I open my mouth and he calls me to eat that role and he said unto me son of man cause I belly to eat and fill thy bowels with this role that I give me then did I eat it and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness now watch John goes further and says but what but in my belly it's bitter one you gotta live it now Ezekiel sure is if you lived it but there was flaws that they'd like David David could have come to a place but when he comes before he freezes right here eat it in my mouth honey for sweetness it's tough but now in Revelations where you got John there what you've got redemption Jesus was already on the scene and going again John when John had to eat the book all right all right just like the bride John cop surprise so the bride's gotta eat the book and all it's great when we're sitting here under the anointing of the honey that's right but when we got to go out there and live it that's the bitterness that's the bitterness to the belly and when we got to go out there and live it not saying is he killed didn't go out then women but he didn't have to live it like we live because he wasn't required to live it like we're required to living is it could be that when you have laws like the Old Testament people had musicians they didn't have to really think that's correct exactly right kid but now when you have the Holy Spirit in you like Johnson we gotta remember that's the judge that's right that's the judge yeah cuz sometimes brother Dale even has to say things he don't even want to say brother branham had the same things he really didn't want to say why that's the bitterness part that's the judge part memories a judge now right he's a judge all right and who the what the Saints will judge Europe so that's the judge inside of it there's a lot of things I believe Jesus in his humanity didn't want to do he didn't want to call them people that follow the devil I don't think he I don't think he hesitated to say it but I in his humanity sure people listened he had to live there's a lot of gaps in this Bible he'll live a long time than he thought a lot right right he went just like like Lewis anyone God zombie yeah he didn't get up and go I have no fog but this and you know no he said I only do what the father tells me to do well the father didn't have time to get up in the morn his body need his father d how tell him to eat e right but when you come down to what he had to fulfil as the son of man I won't talk about son of male was a flesh God God in human flesh amen so God in human flesh there were limitations right right Jesus didn't just go sit on the moon in his flesh no but the son of god Ken right it's on the son of man was the part that kept the Son of God same way with me and you why can't we go to the wall now if we fell over dead today we walked through that wall right ok don't want you to start thinking about some of these things we're not finna put son of David up here to the tree and start thinking about but we still got a lot to do with this son of man alright so let's go there may understand now in Ezekiel what's going on he's prophesying but what's happening if you see that big that capital you know one thing's for sure that's God talking to Israel through a Mac through a little song1 around since I am a son of man revealing the Son of Man right hey man when brother Brandon was living his human life he was the son of man Louis but when he was preaching the Word of God and he said thus said the Lord or he was preaching the great doctrines of marriage and divorce and any simulation that was the son of man I was thinking last night something came up last night about about 9 of 70 weeks after I went to bed so I spent another hour preaching to myself before I went to sleep jim was just rocking me to sleep that's the third guy I listen up I'm not belittling her remember quite brother branham say brother round said I'd wait media and start preaching to us as you fall asleep don't come in yet it happens with profits what listen about the prophets wife if it probably won't me up I'd be going but no listen when God Almighty took three men upon a mountain they were asleep when Almighty God took three men into a garden they fell asleep when Jesus appeared to him in human flesh glorified walked through the wall appeared to him Peter went fishing so if it's not revealed to you anyway Ford you know I'm just I'm just making fun but she was she was sleeping and I was preaching because somebody had brought something about that in 70 weeks come up to my mind and I thought well that had to come through the Son of Man ministry because what happens is the Son of Man ministry has to go to Israel they rejected the Son of Man the flesh park that walked on earth to take a seat but God said I'll never forget Israel so that same man though cannot come back to earth until Israel it's brought back a man because you know what we fulfill the part when we take a body change it is the son of man standing on earth in human flesh and many member body but it's not the son of man standing on human flesh himself right so if we don't get Daniel seventy weeks and these great dolphins correct that son of man you're not going to take a body chain Jesus didn't have a problem when he was on earth it's like brother Ron I really enjoyed that the other night really enjoyed it basically when he come to the park Bree said we're trading as your accuser right saying the fuses everybody right but when Jesus walked up into the home of pilot Ron said if there was one fault against that man of the devil would have found it he said he even had to have a sinner a Gentile say I find no fault in him so there stood a faultless human mortal man with God inside of him that's what we I find no fault in this person right here in other words I find that I was saying in my heart I find no false doctrine in this person because what was Jesus Jesus was his daughter right he was his doctrine may benefit so when he went before Pilate he hey listen the Pharisees and Sadducees was standing there too it wasn't just pilot right they were all standing there that's what r on him really it was a good point he said the devil's going to find one thing he's gone about people going out and doing things you know he said the devil's going to accuse you he said he brought Jesus right down to the Jews were there the Gentiles were there he said basically everybody that was in the world what was like represented in that Hall and he said the devil was everything and do you think if the devil could find fault winning somebody would have said I got this right here and he would have brought it out and he said I find no fault with it that was the son of man that we got to see so in other words you can't find false doctrine in the Sun man you tell me one place that's been talked often in the son of man that's why the Son of Man ministry had been here now you take the Son of God it has no fault but you put him in a flash man he can have its own ideas right right sons of God have died because of their doctrine Luke and died because of his doctrine Son of God doctrine is not three gods or Trinity but when that son of God when in blücher the devil through the filter Tony with Trinity right that's Wayne's in the grave that's why all these people are in the grave that's wandering the grave right because they don't have their doctrine our fault we're so i can say i find no fault in you alright so that's to me i thought that was really good point of a brought out at a devil will don't you think he miss an opportunity to bring the fall town especially knowing that that was man with different than the rest of them if he could have found one thing well hey like jesus jesus walks up you know that goes the woman down in adultery when you tell it woman where's your cancer Jesus didn't see it so he said I find no fault in you i cants I didn't see you do that now Jesus would literally say they're coming to dr. hida headstone now that's me and you we know we did it she knew she knew she committed adultery Jesus didn't ask her did you commit adultery he knew she'd committed adultery by the way they by the way she was right he knows me and you got caught and what's in in this body in this place we got caught but hey in the mouth of two or three witnesses let everything this time with jesus said if i can get rid of their accusers I didn't see her do it I didn't see her do it I didn't see you do it because this man they were done right okay but now it comes down to where these two come together so close where you find no fault in this man they weren't talking about finding fault in this man and was no fault in this man room but when you put him in here look at all the things he went through line for three and a half years especially where the focus of the ministry was on Jesus we find no fault with it so we go for subject cool ability that's okay let's turn to Matthew just for a minute and let's read the parable of the sower of the seed Matthew 13 because this is where he brings right in of what's going on the same day when she is out of the house step outside great most people gathered together unto him so that you went into those ships at the whole month to stone shore he's paid many things of them in parables saying behold a sower went forth to so now we all know that parable correct but now what happens is verse 10 disciples came unto him said unto him without the Holy Ghost they were what they were reading the clothes long time without the Holy Ghost they were reading the quote all right they went getting the essence when I saw them to them last night at the table you can take lavender and you can take peppermint and spearmint and all those and they're asleep they're just liquid how do you tell their different by their essence of their odor that you smell you say that's peppermint why that's what it gives forth but if you look at it if you pour it in all those cups if you pour lavender and spearmint all these and these different cuff it's all the same color liquid is liquid but the essence in other words they might have heard that a story like this why speak two thousand to them in parallel and the answer them because it is given this you to know the mysteries of the kingdom but to them it's not given what was he doing Jesus was saying in other words one day you're really going to understand what I'm doing all right but not to them yuva no words what he said you got to tell them he is given unto you what here's the sample so what if there's a samples do they took it and give it to them you got that it's the man what they were minister watch you ever have to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but they never have not from him she'll be taken away even that he had therefore speak unto them in parables because they see see not hearing they hear not neither do they understand and Dennis fulfill the prophet Isaiah which says by hearing he show here and she'll know understanding seeing you justin's you'll not proceed remember seeing is what it's all I got to do with understanding alright so let's go look many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things with GC and have not seen them and to hear those things with G here and have not heard them here you therefore the parable of the sower what a wonderful guy I what a wonderful God that can tell us these things he keeps telling them he's telling them right here in 24 I do that but what you doing he keep talking but nobody say he explains to him in verse 37 but skip down the letters for a few minutes he answered and said unto them he that so it's a good seed is who'd son of man gone listen God in spirit form is the seed listen to minute God in spirit form is to see right Nazis as a mini Galatians 3 16 but what thy seed which is Christ are so there's one seed but the salt good sea the sower even so what the good seed is the son of man the Son of God for for what four thousand years before Jesus came on earth sure he was sowing seed but remember he went sowing seed in the heart of ya through the prophets but he went sowing seed in the heart of man there was no new birth and in Old Testament okay web so in seated in the heart of men all right he was sowing seed in the ground that's what a crop to come up remember you don't sow seed then God and say well I'll harvest my for tomorrow no it's got to come up come up two stages mature but he is talking good see he is telling you exactly do they say it's decent man not a son of man d son ma'am capital ass so who was you talking about miss out you stole my self all right he was talking about him standing on the earth the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom whose children of the kingdom the new burrow is what the kingdom all right the new verb is the kingdom now the children of the kingdom must be the people that receiving you murdered that kind of one plus one equals two all right so they did see the good seed is if you look to your Villa kingdom that's one of us let me stop this man that's why let's talk about last night in Daniel seventy weeks everybody's look looking at all these quotes and all these things are you gonna do is go to Bible are you doing on the model Daniel 924 explains every bit of it without I make sure we had to have a property to bring it to us but once the probably brought it to us it's not brother random revelation that I got the revelation now I got a revelation same revelation of property god man the Bible says that there's three periods seven-week the 62 week in one week and when you get to this one in the scripture says he shall make a covenant with many for one week a lot of people say that's God god don't break covenants if you'll keep reading it says he breaks the Covenant so that he is who Antichrist now listen the prophet of God told us we're not here when the Antichrist makes that coming up with the Jews so the rapture has to take place before that one week begins simple as it can be you can't argue with that kind of dense a days a week left it says they would one full week or seven years well after the rapture of the church there seven years so I mean I mean it's just simple me it is actually more simple you can't complicate it with what quotes but the essence of the quote is what you go look in the field is the world against each other the kingdom tears are the children of the wicked one now watch though both come up right both are coming up the tears are coming up to alright the field is the world the enemy that sowed them is the devil so there's two people on the same the Son of Man and the devil all right the enemy of some of mrs. devil the harvest at the end of the world and the Reapers of the Angels as there for the tares are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of this world the Son of man shall send forth his angels now watch those angels what's what they do they show gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and then let's do iniquity he said all those are those are bad angels no remember brother Brian saying God sends a messenger what does the messenger do three things he comes on San brings his message condemns the people for falling away from the previous message and what condemns the world brings judgment all right every time I probably hits the earth he's bringing judgment but he can also bring in the oh so that's what to me that's that's the seven churches his angels and they shall gather out of his kingdom all that offend then was doing it me and she'll cast him in the furnace upon what not literally pick him up throw them out but his word is dividing his word is dividing the weed in the tariff all right and she'll cast into furniture father's should be waiting a gnashing teeth then shall the righteous shine forth there's the Sun in the kingdom of their father so they got a day so they must be children who had ears to hear let him hear then you come back to treasure get in the field but the store the seeds are sown man why why this is our tempo think about this for next Sunday this is not our kinsman in this form this is your hope of God the judge one of us right father this is our kinsman a man this is our kinsman redeemer sure is this man in this man but he had to come some land to redeem the earth what was he so in the sea scott nomar's you showed it in the earth hey man he had to come to this earth and what is the sowing of the seed the preaching of the gospel hey man this is the only seed there is right all right right but there's many seeds inside this eve hey man 1 c 2 apple plant in the ground and when he comes up these thousands and thousands of apples gonna be produced you don't want brother brown said they were everyone in that seed when you plant them in the ground boy boy a mighty God one thing there we go the angel thing verse 41 there goes seven messenger yes yes now you can type that as as investigating angel or whatever but to me this is the only thing right here we're we're right here Joe gather out of his kingdom so they got to be down here preaching on the earth and what they're doing is when they when Martin Luther preach his gospel he divided the wheat from the tears right hey man he divided the wheat from the tears John Wesley he divided the week from the tears william branham Paul Paul divided the wheat from the tears he took them out of the kingdom sent forth his angels and they shall gather know what would you all together now why gathers people the preaching of the gospel is one gathers people right but what does it do brother Brad said God is the segregationist he segregates and that's exactly what he's doing right here but he's not said you're getting up here he already knows what's going on he's segregating here so no man the store the seed the one that's down here doing the work just thinking about that Thank Sunday
