[5:18] that amen so we always honor our our
[5:21] veterans and our active servicemen so uh
[5:24] brother Aaron will be preaching for us
[5:25] Wednesday night um like I said the
[5:28] questions and answers are Bible Study
[5:30] last night was was wonderful we really
[5:32] enjoyed it and uh we'll be touching a
[5:35] little bit on it today usually sometimes
[5:36] we weave into uh into what uh what we
[5:40] talked about because the anointing still
[5:42] there of what we were talking about but
[5:44] but um one of the things that really
[5:46] come out of the the first question that
[5:47] brother John dured asked was about his
[5:50] children and we all have children we all
[5:52] were children so we had a good
[5:54] discussion cry about our kids and uh
[5:59] they're part of you we love them all I
[6:02] love your kids but I'm not connected to
[6:05] them right you are connected to them by
[6:07] DNA they came forth from you they're
[6:10] yours you claim them I claim them but
[6:13] you claim them cu the Bible said you'll
[6:15] be there with your offsprings you claim
[6:17] them yes sir don't look at the
[6:20] circumstances we are children of Abraham
[6:23] If Abraham would have wrote down every
[6:25] circumstance he' have never had that
[6:27] child Isa would have never come into
[6:30] being if he would have wrote down I'm
[6:32] too old can't do this Sarah can't do
[6:34] that I'm this I'm too
[6:36] old right he didn't write any of that
[6:39] down he he he looked and brother R said
[6:41] it just like he had the baby right he
[6:44] just had to go through the 25 year
[6:45] journe 25
[6:47] years we can't wait 15 minutes 20
[6:49] minutes Hour 2 days 3 weeks 2 years 25
[6:53] years for one promise to come to pass
[6:56] but you know what it came to pass that's
[6:59] the faith of Abraham that we have so we
[7:01] appreciate the Bible Study last night we
[7:03] had a really good time um now
[7:07] um let me see oh between Services um

[10:48] 1 like I like I said again thank you all
[10:50] for coming thank you for yesterday for
[10:52] for participating in that service last
[10:55] night we we got some I think we got some
[10:57] questions answered and uh we learned a
[11:00] little bit from the Lord thank you all
[11:01] for being there and I want to re
[11:03] reiterate one more time for any of you
[11:07] that have a office song
[11:10] leader musician is iffy but if you got a
[11:14] spiritual part of this church you need
[11:16] to be at Bible study every time we have
[11:19] it because 99% of us
[11:23] are thank you thank you for somebody
[11:25] saying that right so and we're not
[11:29] singling nobody out but it's like I said
[11:31] last night you don't have to tell Holy
[11:33] Ghost Phill people to go to church
[11:36] you're talking to the unbeliever and the
[11:38] mate believer when you tell people they
[11:40] need to go to church cuz a True Believer
[11:42] will always go to church regardless if
[11:46] your cat's got diarrhea as we talked
[11:48] about last night so Revelations 1
[11:52] verse1 I sounds so silly but that's kind
[11:54] of the mistakes we make and then you
[11:56] know Monday and Tuesday next week we
[11:57] look on Facebook and you hauled it all
[11:59] up to Pigeon Forge and boy you can't sit
[12:01] in church for never mind I'm sorry for
[12:04] an hour and a half and you drive four
[12:05] hours up there and it just it's what's
[12:08] in your
[12:08] heart come on somebody it's what's in
[12:11] your heart if it's not in your heart
[12:13] you're not going to do it God's going to
[12:15] have to get in touch get in touch with
[12:17] you just like your kids you God's got to
[12:20] get in touch with your kids I wish my
[12:22] mom would have saved me 20 years ago or
[12:24] 30 40 years ago now but it wasn't time
[12:28] and she can't save
[12:30] me I got one that can though I got one
[12:33] that can there a heavenly father that
[12:35] can save any person on the face of the
[12:38] Earth that hadn't blasphemed the Holy
[12:39] Ghost
[12:41] amen that's a promise that we have that
[12:44] he'll save our kids just like brother
[12:47] Brown said whatever Faith you got for
[12:49] you you apply it to your kids if you
[12:51] don't have faith enough for yourself you
[12:53] don't have faith enough for your kids so
[12:55] you have faith enough that you're

[13:39] our hands and and and tell you how much
[13:41] we love you Lord thank you so much for
[13:44] giving us a a a a congregation and a
[13:46] church to go to and and family and
[13:49] friends Lord we appreciate it all father
[13:52] just bless again all of our children
[13:54] that are wavered Lord I pray that right
[13:57] now that it'll stir their water so much
[14:00] till they'll be so
[14:03] aggravated till they'll be so
[14:06] Restless till they'll have to cry out to
[14:08] you
[14:09] Lord and we we believe that with all our
[14:13] heart cuz you're in the business of
[14:16] still saving people amen Lord save the
[14:19] ones that need saving you know who they
[14:21] are in Jesus name we pray amen
[14:24] Revelations 1:10 I was in the spirit on
[14:26] the Lord's day and heard behind me a
[14:27] great voice of of a ET saying I am Alpha
[14:30] we're still talking about the Alpha and
[14:32] Omega bride the first and the last what
[14:34] thou seest right in the book and send it
[14:36] to the seven churches we don't have to
[14:38] name them and I turned to see the voice
[14:40] and being turned I saw seven golden
[14:44] candlesticks oh sorry about that all the
[14:47] old people are
[14:49] squinting amen okay sorry sorry I was
[14:54] hey y'all go ahead and sit down I don't
[14:56] I don't want you to be standing up so
[14:57] much just
[15:01] amen says the older people amen amen see
[15:06] there told you and they identifi
[15:08] theirself very quickly all right can I
[15:11] can we read it now I'm sorry I was
[15:13] reading it just fine right where I was
[15:15] at all right so I was in the spirit on
[15:17] the Lord's day and we understand all
[15:19] that and in the midst of the seven
[15:20] candlesticks one liken to the son of man
[15:22] clothed with a garment down to the foot
[15:23] and G about the pouch with a golden
[15:25] girdle Revelations
[15:27] 1:16 he had an right hand Seven Stars
[15:30] and out of his mouth one a sharp
[15:32] two-edged
[15:33] sword now the mystery of those seven
[15:35] stars and as I've been saying before the
[15:38] connection God has with these
[15:41] people see I don't have a problem with
[15:44] with brother RMA always tells us he said
[15:46] it's hard for one man to believe another
[15:50] man right CU there's always that
[15:53] question there's always that well what
[15:55] angle there no there's not an angle he
[15:57] had seven men
[15:59] that he brought the message to gave it
[16:03] to them and they gave it to the people
[16:05] and listen God had a group of people
[16:07] there that would receive it all right he
[16:09] didn't have a group of people there that
[16:11] just said well I don't think I'll that's
[16:13] not for me it's for somebody else there
[16:14] was a group of people that when they
[16:16] heard Luther preach they said as had he
[16:18] right said that ain't nothing but the
[16:20] truth
[16:23] amen do we say
[16:25] that do we have that same Revelation
[16:28] that this is nothing but the truth there
[16:29] is no false Doctrine there is no error
[16:33] in this message now there's error in
[16:34] people there's error in people but
[16:37] there's not an error in this message
[16:39] amen cuz it came straight from God it
[16:41] came through the logos and we got 1,00
[16:44] sermons of the voice of God speaking to
[16:47] us in our
[16:50] generation and then as we were talking
[16:51] about last night the five-fold ministry
[16:54] then breaks it down and carries it and
[16:56] gives it to the people even even though
[16:58] the messengers already laid away all
[17:01] right that's the way God said he was
[17:02] going to do it we'll look at it here in
[17:04] just a minute but the Seven Stars are
[17:06] the Angels and the Seven candlesticks
[17:09] are the seven churches all right Amos
[17:12] 5:8 says seek him that maketh the Seven
[17:14] Stars and Orion and we'll talk about
[17:17] that way later on because there is Seven
[17:19] Stars and then we know there's eight
[17:20] manifestations of God so the seven
[17:23] Church ages is a complete and final
[17:25] revelation of Jesus Christ to the
[17:26] Gentile Nation now you hear what I said
[17:28] to the Gentiles yes not to the not to
[17:31] the whole world to the Gentile us
[17:33] Nations our dispensation is soon to be
[17:37] over yes sir whether you like it or
[17:40] not amen then he goes to the Jews he's
[17:43] not coming back and getting you again
[17:45] that's right no this is it when he shuts
[17:48] the door it's closed all right and then
[17:51] he goes and and uh takes three and A2
[17:53] years of a message to the Jews same
[17:55] message you're hearing today amen and
[17:58] and they and they realized the 144,000
[18:01] realize what happened they missed the
[18:03] whole thing that's right they missed it
[18:05] all but now through two prophets as
[18:08] we're standing here today telling that
[18:10] the Messiah is here to save our children
[18:12] the Messiah is here to save us it's the
[18:14] same Messiah that's going to go over
[18:16] there that they missed back 2,000 years
[18:18] ago and he's going to what he's going to
[18:20] save their
[18:21] soul he's not going to do like we said
[18:24] last night God will never when you come
[18:25] to the Lord God will never say what took
[18:27] you so long
[18:28] right he knows exactly how long it took
[18:32] you came at your time yes sir cuz God's
[18:35] perfect I don't know if y'all knew that
[18:37] or
[18:38] not but there's a new dispensation then
[18:40] we we saw the old dispensation which was
[18:42] the Old Testament and I kind of I think
[18:45] I may have said it before but I kind of
[18:47] threw him a curve at work the other day
[18:48] they was talking about Jesus and being
[18:50] in the New Testament and I said no Jesus
[18:52] wasn't in the New
[18:54] Testament oh
[18:57] Lord well he wasn't the Bible said he
[19:00] was born under the law what was the law
[19:04] the Old Testament he was born under the
[19:07] law to redeem them what that are under
[19:09] the law he came to bring them out to
[19:11] bring a new as we're going to read next
[19:13] Sunday a new testament someone had to
[19:17] die so the testator that gave this will
[19:19] had to pass away all right then there
[19:22] become a New and Living Way which was
[19:25] now through the baptism of the Holy
[19:27] Ghost which was not in the Old
[19:29] Testament I mean Jesus would even tell
[19:31] them he would heal them he' say hey go
[19:33] do the law of Moses what do you know
[19:35] what I'm saying when a leper was healed
[19:38] he would have to go to the temple show
[19:41] itself to the priest and the priest
[19:44] would declare him clean now why did
[19:47] Jesus just say well bless God you ain't
[19:48] got to go tell them nothing you're
[19:49] healed no soon as he healed him he said
[19:51] go do the law of Moses why cuz he was
[19:53] still in the Old Testament there was not
[19:55] a New and Living Way yet it was coming
[19:58] yes it was introduced by John and he was
[20:00] standing there but he saved no one while
[20:02] he was here that's right the bride
[20:06] dispensation was inside of that man but
[20:09] it was not fulfilled on the outside
[20:11] until the day of
[20:12] Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell on a
[20:15] group of people 120 in the Upper Room
[20:18] everybody
[20:19] good but Paul picks it up and says a New
[20:21] and Living Way that's what you and I are
[20:23] living under right now A New and Living
[20:25] Way yes sir not some new do
[20:30] no remember what Paul did and we'll get
[20:33] to it in a little bit Paul took the Old
[20:35] Testament listen there was no New
[20:37] Testament written like this when Paul
[20:40] was
[20:40] here he was writing it himself parts of
[20:44] it so he took that Old
[20:47] Testament and wrote 80% of the New
[20:50] Testament off of that Old Testament
[20:53] scroll now what a prophet though because
[20:56] Caiaphas and all the other ones even G
[20:58] milon of different ones they didn't see
[20:59] that why they weren't supposed to
[21:01] because they weren't a mouthpiece of God
[21:03] they didn't come straight from God they
[21:04] didn't have the will of God they didn't
[21:06] have the logos of
[21:08] God but Paul did CU he was a messenger
[21:11] he was one of those Stars so a new
[21:14] testament is a new is a covenant or a
[21:16] will a new testament that the testator
[21:18] had to die so we had to have someone to
[21:21] die before we could live that's right so
[21:25] each age had his message and its
[21:27] messenger all through the times every
[21:29] age has packed his message with a
[21:31] messenger god in every dispensation has
[21:34] sent forth someone Anointed with the
[21:35] Holy Spirit to bring forth his message
[21:38] for that age every time all right just
[21:42] coming back through now brother R
[21:43] explained this in the seals but I kind
[21:45] of broke it down where we can understand
[21:46] it there was an announcement in heaven
[21:49] so out of the mind of God comes the
[21:51] logos words a sealed up message that
[21:53] that that Columba had a message but it
[21:57] wasn't the Just sh
[21:59] Faith all right but when Luther stepped
[22:02] forward God said this is what I want you
[22:04] to tell the
[22:06] people that the just not not penants not
[22:09] not uh novenas not laying out on a board
[22:12] not dragging yourself through the
[22:14] through the through the briers no the
[22:16] just shall live by faith God was happy
[22:18] with Luther during that time even though
[22:21] Luther had some false ideas I said
[22:23] Luther did God
[22:25] don't but then he took that man off the
[22:27] s and here it just kept rolling to
[22:30] Wesley and then John Wesley stands up
[22:32] and says hey you can't do like Luther
[22:34] you can't go in a pub and drink a beer
[22:37] and smoke a pipe all right you got to
[22:39] come and be Sanctified and God said
[22:42] that's exactly what I'm saying that's
[22:44] exactly what I'm telling you yes sir
[22:47] books were being printed at that time
[22:48] Bibles were being printed so people were
[22:50] able to read it but what happened though
[22:52] the Catholic Church took all that back
[22:54] and started reading it in Latin and
[22:56] nobody understood anything so Luther
[22:58] comes out puts his th that's on the wall
[23:00] and says hey the just shall live by
[23:01] faith that's in the Bible listen the
[23:03] just shall live by faith in the Old
[23:05] Testament
[23:08] am there is we don't we don't discount
[23:11] the Old Testament we know that those of
[23:12] you that are that that don't come here
[23:15] we don't discount the Old Testament it's
[23:17] all a building
[23:19] block but we don't
[23:21] live where we sacrifice animals and and
[23:24] have to go the priest goes one time a
[23:27] year and and oh that'd be so
[23:29] easy that'd be so easy to come to church
[23:32] once a year like some of y'all do
[23:35] anyway praise the Lord anyhow let one
[23:38] high priest go in and he's got it he did
[23:40] it all brother Kylie so see you next
[23:42] year about
[23:44] Christmas I'm not talking to you you
[23:46] know
[23:47] that but God gives us an announcement
[23:50] and then a it's all right he said a
[23:52] messenger when you get when you get
[23:54] older they like
[23:56] whatever
[23:59] but a sealed up message is open and
[24:01] listen Luther may have read in the Bible
[24:05] as the Bible was being written Luther
[24:06] may have read hey you need to be
[24:08] Sanctified the unclean Spirit goes out
[24:10] he may have read some of that because it
[24:11] was coming together but he didn't have a
[24:13] revelation of that part the revelation
[24:15] of his part was is if you believe you
[24:19] live by faith you're
[24:21] Justified God justifies those that live
[24:24] by him and his and your faith through
[24:26] him which is his faith anyway then John
[24:29] Wesley he comes and reads the same Bible
[24:32] that's right and he sees though that the
[24:35] unclean Spirit goes out he sees that
[24:36] there are there's a sanctifying in the
[24:38] blood and all Paul talks about it all
[24:41] well he picks that up what is it it's an
[24:43] announcement from
[24:45] God the logos the speech of God a sealed
[24:49] up message is opened and a mystery is
[24:52] unfolded to the star of that age which
[24:55] is the messenger that picks up the L God
[24:58] from God one
[25:00] person one person to every every Church
[25:03] age not two not three one all
[25:06] right now there are many other ministers
[25:08] in between that but as we were talking
[25:10] about last night there's Major Prophets
[25:11] Minor Prophets prophets in the five-fold
[25:13] ministry there's different levels of
[25:16] prophets all right so a trumpet then
[25:19] sounds what happens Luther finally
[25:21] stepped out one day nailed o thus and
[25:25] said I ain't going back to Catholic
[25:26] Church no more right amen the just shall
[25:29] live by faith abolutely this is what I'm
[25:32] living by he made a stand brother Rand
[25:35] stands up he says I ain't going back to
[25:36] that
[25:39] Pentecostal I'm going forward I'm not
[25:41] going to that Baptist I'm not going to
[25:42] that Methodist I'm going forward all
[25:45] right so the message is proclaimed but
[25:47] now as we see the message being
[25:50] proclaimed and we'll see in brother
[25:52] bram's day and parallel in Jesus cuz
[25:55] everybody loved Jesus everybody Lov Jes
[25:57] Jesus when he was taking Five Loaves and
[26:00] and giving you a social program you know
[26:02] feeding 5,000 people and everybody's
[26:05] like right turned the water into wine
[26:09] well he was doing good everybody lik
[26:11] that but when he stood up one day and
[26:14] said my
[26:15] daddy ain't your
[26:17] daddy right hall when he told the
[26:22] religious group of the day my father is
[26:25] not your father
[26:28] amen I'm the Son of God he never
[26:30] proclaimed that but they told him and
[26:32] they they knew enough he said we're not
[26:33] going to kill you for your good work
[26:35] we're killing you because you said you
[26:36] were God cuz he told him he said hey you
[26:38] read in your Old Testament that you are
[26:40] Gods who the word comes to so the Bible
[26:42] didn't have any problem with that but
[26:44] the religious people did because
[26:46] remember as as God sends his people to
[26:51] hear the message so does Satan send his
[26:54] people to destroy it sir right all right
[26:57] so so we can't say well this is just a
[26:58] flower bed of ease like we were talking
[27:00] about last night I wish that when we got
[27:02] saved everybody got saved around
[27:04] me a
[27:06] happening Satan turns every gun on you
[27:08] and he's shooting at you then so we just
[27:11] are going to have issues as Christians
[27:15] because the world hates us Satan hates
[27:18] us more than anything Satan hates us so
[27:20] he'll send everything in the world yes
[27:22] sir to make us not believe or not come
[27:25] to church or or or as they're doing now
[27:27] brother R them
[27:29] down they just need to get born
[27:33] again a trumpet sounds a message is
[27:36] proclaimed a church age begins a
[27:38] distinct and declared message all right
[27:41] so we understand the just shall live by
[27:43] faith sanctification Pentecostals with
[27:45] the gifts and then brother randam
[27:47] bringing the pure unadulterated word
[27:49] restoring us back to the faith of the
[27:51] fathers that we're talking about now the
[27:52] first church age because Alpha and Omega
[27:54] has to be the same or mirror image of
[27:57] each other other but it starts a
[27:58] spiritual war as we were saying last
[28:00] night it starts a
[28:01] war I told him I said all y'all sitting
[28:04] in here
[28:05] tonight it's a
[28:07] war it's a battle yes it is and the
[28:11] reason you're here crying your eyes out
[28:13] for your kids it's because of that
[28:15] battle but it's because you're on The
[28:17] Winning Side you on the Victorious side
[28:21] you said I'm going to make a stand right
[28:25] here I'm not going to right you can XYZ
[28:29] wherever some of y'all were that weren't
[28:31] here last
[28:32] night they were here crying for their
[28:34] kids where were
[28:36] you save my kids start living in front
[28:39] of them
[28:40] right I said that we said that last
[28:42] night right brother D's always said a
[28:44] lot of your kids are not here because of
[28:46] you now he said that I'm you get mad at
[28:48] him don't get mad at me because of the
[28:50] life you live in front
[28:54] of I will I'm going to continue
[28:56] preaching starts a spiritual war the
[29:00] true word of God versus false
[29:02] Doctrine all
[29:05] right everybody with me so there's going
[29:08] to be false Doctrine okay we've got to
[29:11] watch for it that's why I said last
[29:12] night we were talking about uh the
[29:14] five-fold ministry and how uh when I
[29:17] started coming back to church I had some
[29:18] of the younger ministers that were my
[29:20] age or or that I associated with that
[29:22] dad never associated with well I would
[29:24] say hey we need to listen to brother
[29:26] Andrew GL of course he was a you by then
[29:28] back then but you know we need to can
[29:30] can we bring this one in and he says
[29:32] where they go to
[29:34] church and I wonder why he asked me that
[29:36] three or four times said where' they go
[29:37] to
[29:38] church I said well they go and they all
[29:40] did but he said there'll nobody ever
[29:42] preach in this church they doesn't have
[29:44] a church amen now think about
[29:48] that you won't preach in this church if
[29:50] you don't have a church cuz there was
[29:52] too many Fly by Night people that came
[29:54] through here back in the 70s and ' 80s
[29:56] and and and flew in and and flew out and
[30:00] you never heard from them or they were
[30:01] over here and they never had you got to
[30:04] have listen you got to have a place to
[30:05] go to church listen je forny those whole
[30:08] the whole time he was an evangelist he
[30:11] proclaimed that Tim Humes was his pastor
[30:14] and that that was the church that he
[30:15] went to now whether he preached 80
[30:17] something uh days a year somewhere else
[30:20] that was still his home Church yes sir
[30:23] so you got to have a home Church you got
[30:24] to have some kind of stability to be
[30:27] able to as I'm saying here false
[30:29] Doctrine can come in but if you're
[30:31] sitting under a real true good pastor I
[30:34] don't care if you're an evangelist or
[30:35] whatever teacher you got to listen faith
[30:39] comes by hearing not by
[30:41] preaching all
[30:43] right so then when the messenger listen
[30:46] when his voice is
[30:48] finished the messenger is laid
[30:52] away remember Joshua stood there and he
[30:55] was um tutored with by Moses all that
[30:58] period of
[31:01] time but Moses went off the scene right
[31:04] amen he even was real plain he looked at
[31:08] Joshua and he looked at the people
[31:09] through Joshua and said Moses thy
[31:11] servant is dead that's right brother
[31:13] brandom's
[31:15] gone sure we give
[31:17] honor but why go
[31:20] backwards why go backwards there's a lot
[31:23] of people and I'm going to say it one
[31:25] time and I'm not going to ever say it
[31:26] again some people people's Holy Ghost is
[31:28] what's standing in the pull
[31:34] pit I've seen it in many many churches
[31:37] something happened to the pastor and he
[31:38] die or or leave and go somewhere else
[31:40] two or three people go with him or don't
[31:42] even go back to church again why that
[31:43] person was their Holy Ghost don't you
[31:45] ever make anybody in this pull pit your
[31:47] Holy Ghost not a man nobody you make the
[31:50] God of this universe be your Holy Ghost
[31:53] and then you know what he'll lead you
[31:54] and guide you into all truth you'll know
[31:56] what you do and then you not dependent
[31:58] on one person to make
[32:03] it everybody all right with that because
[32:06] God keeps moving he'll use somebody for
[32:09] Hey Brother Ram told us he said God can
[32:10] use a minister One
[32:13] Time One
[32:15] sermon right one of the greatest
[32:18] preachers was John the Baptist six
[32:21] months yes sir he didn't have a
[32:23] worldwide campaign either he stayed in
[32:25] the Jordan River most of the time
[32:28] right but it was powerful God needed
[32:30] that if God uses you for one sermon and
[32:33] not anymore praise God if God uses you
[32:36] for that
[32:37] absolutely amen amen so that messenger
[32:40] is laid away or taken off the
[32:43] Earth and then we have to decide the
[32:46] people accept it or reject it bringing a
[32:49] temporary judgment or a plague in other
[32:51] words spiritual death to the ones who
[32:53] reject their
[32:56] messenger
[32:58] we'll look here in just a few minutes
[33:01] where Paul said Grievous wolves are
[33:03] going to come in but he didn't say he he
[33:06] he continued on he said um it's going to
[33:09] happen in here it's not just going to be
[33:11] out there it's going to happen right
[33:12] here among you all right so the next day
[33:15] same thing announcement out of the mind
[33:17] of God comes a logos a sealed up message
[33:19] is open a Mysteries unfolded to the star
[33:20] of that age and then he proclaims his
[33:23] message and then God puts him away takes
[33:25] him off the Earth and leaves the
[33:27] anointing on the earth oh yes sir all
[33:29] right he leaves that prophetic that's
[33:32] why brother R kept telling us he he sure
[33:34] he was the listen he was the
[33:37] funnel the trumpet that God used to
[33:40] trumpet
[33:41] out but you and I have to hear
[33:44] it and if it's an uncertain sound you're
[33:48] not born
[33:49] again but if it rings in your heart and
[33:51] you say that ain't nothing but the truth
[33:54] that's what rings in your heart yes sir
[33:56] it's a a heart thing not a head thing
[34:00] seen a lot of people a lot of head
[34:02] knowledge but no
[34:04] heart what God
[34:07] choose the heart right man chooses the
[34:10] Mind Satan choose the mind right every
[34:13] time that's right to Revelations 1 ver8
[34:16] says I am Alpha and Omega the beginning
[34:18] and the end sayith the Lord which is and
[34:20] which was and which is to come the
[34:22] almighty so the day of Pentecost started
[34:25] on 0 in 830
[34:27] some 50 days after Jesus left the Earth
[34:30] and that was the alpha church but now
[34:32] the real first church age began in ad 53
[34:36] so that was from 30 to 53 you got 23
[34:39] some odd years because remember listen
[34:42] Peter there was no spokesman on the day
[34:45] there was a spokesman on the day of
[34:46] Pentecost called Peter right but he
[34:49] wasn't the messenger to the church age
[34:51] right he wasn't the star he had a
[34:53] message he had a part but he wasn't a
[34:56] star
[34:58] so if that happened in the alpha church
[35:01] that's got to happen in the Omega Church
[35:04] so how did our Prophet come on the scene
[35:07] I've said many times before if brother
[35:09] Brandon would have just come right
[35:11] straight out of uh remember he was a
[35:13] Baptist right heet had come straight out
[35:15] of the Baptist and started preaching the
[35:17] Baptist Doctrine or even come out of
[35:19] Wesley or or Luther or
[35:22] somewhere but he came out of the move of
[35:24] the day right
[35:27] Paul came out of the move of the day
[35:29] which was the Pentecostal blessing that
[35:32] was there in ad30 so brother random
[35:35] comes on the scene after that
[35:36] Pentecostal blessing of 1906 isza Street
[35:40] which is the Omega Church he got to
[35:42] start like the alpha Church did and then
[35:44] the seventh Church age begins somewhat
[35:46] after that all right everybody with me
[35:48] this is going to help you in the end
[35:50] when we get down to the to the end of
[35:51] this thing because the beginning and the
[35:53] ending of the Gentile dispensation had
[35:55] to begin the same way as it end end or
[35:58] it's not Alpha and Omega it's not your
[35:59] book ends all right so the age of
[36:02] Pentecost was ad30 the messenger was the
[36:04] Holy Ghost himself Acts 2 verse1 says
[36:07] when the day of Pentecost was fully come
[36:09] they were all with one Accord in one
[36:11] place and suddenly there came a sound
[36:13] from Heaven as a rushing Mighty Wind and
[36:15] it filled all the house where they were
[36:17] sitting God for an experience like that
[36:20] and they appeared under them clothing
[36:21] tongues like as of fire and it sat upon
[36:24] each of them and they were all filled
[36:26] with the Holy ghost and began to speak
[36:27] with other tongues as the what not as
[36:30] the spokesman gave them
[36:33] utterance as the spirit capital S gave
[36:37] them utterance all right everybody with
[36:39] me so the age of Pentecost 1906 zza
[36:42] Street they had a spokesperson daddy
[36:43] Seymour and all the different ones param
[36:46] and all the ones that were the spokesman
[36:48] but brother R tells us right here in CR
[36:50] questions and answers he said then the
[36:52] next Age come the Lutheran the reform
[36:54] age there went the wives with the
[36:55] cunningness of man
[36:57] if you notice man went forth with that
[36:59] and when he did he added his own
[37:01] shrewdness that's what married him into
[37:02] the other part see if he just stayed
[37:05] with God's wisdom just reforming and
[37:07] pulling out but what did he do after
[37:09] that man that had the message Luther
[37:11] after the death of Luther they had a
[37:13] Lutheran
[37:14] organization Luther didn't organize it
[37:17] the people after him
[37:18] did after the death of Wesley they had a
[37:21] Methodist organization which started
[37:24] afterwards and if Wesley would come back
[37:26] to now and see what the Methodist Church
[37:28] has
[37:28] become he' tear it all to
[37:31] pieces amen now I want you to notice
[37:34] this now someone might ask about the
[37:36] Pentecostal which was the third age now
[37:39] brother R's not confused is everybody
[37:42] with me the third age is pergamus but
[37:44] he's talking about Luther's
[37:45] justification Wesley was sanctification
[37:48] and the third age or stage the baptism
[37:51] of the Holy Ghost there's a messenger
[37:53] sent all right you see each one of these
[37:56] ages on only took a dip in the Holy
[37:57] Spirit justification is the work of the
[37:59] Holy Spirit sanctification is work of
[38:00] the Holy Spirit but the baptism is the
[38:03] holy spirit that's the reason it took a
[38:05] prophetic Prophet to come down no
[38:07] Messenger to the age so there was no
[38:09] Messenger to the age of Pentecost the
[38:11] Holy Ghost came himself because the Holy
[38:13] Ghost came himself in his fullness of
[38:16] the baptism but at the end of the age as
[38:18] it was always ends up the other ones
[38:20] where Paul Come Paul didn't come at the
[38:22] end of the Ephesian age or he would have
[38:23] he missed his message and his people
[38:26] right he came at the end of the
[38:27] Pentecostal
[38:29] age met up with Peter and all the
[38:31] different
[38:33] ones you come over here to this side at
[38:37] the end of the Pentecostal age brother
[38:39] brandham comes on the scene or Elijah
[38:41] comes on the scene and brings a message
[38:43] all right he's the messenger to Lea not
[38:47] to the
[38:49] Pentecostal I'll prove it to you here in
[38:51] just a minute so look and we find there
[38:53] then that the messenger sent all these
[38:56] Scruples and things are to be placed in
[38:58] their place like that then the Rapture
[39:00] comes for the church so Peter was a
[39:02] spokesperson as was param and as was the
[39:05] oneeyed black man um daddy Seymour and
[39:09] they had the key to open the door to the
[39:10] Gentiles until Paul came on the scene
[39:12] the Pentecostals brought the gifts back
[39:15] into the church so then see brother Ram
[39:17] could step out on that platform cuz he
[39:20] was a he was restoring the gifts yes
[39:23] they had already
[39:24] started but they were still trying to
[39:26] Arians they were still um um baptized in
[39:29] father son Holy Ghost they still had
[39:31] their
[39:32] Scruples all right well see they might
[39:34] have had that in the first age too
[39:35] because they read him just a little bit
[39:37] but when Paul comes on the scene Paul
[39:38] says hey you know quit that
[39:40] stuff you can't be say it's ain't lawful
[39:42] for you to be married to your
[39:44] mother-in-law that's in the Bible if
[39:45] y'all didn't know that Peter was a
[39:48] spokesperson and had the key to open the
[39:50] door to the Gentiles until Paul came on
[39:51] the scene so did the Pentecostal age
[39:53] until brother brandham comes on the
[39:54] scene 1947 the first message he preaches
[39:57] is
[39:59] Faith so God comes on the scene in a
[40:02] powerful powerful way preaching Faith
[40:05] all right everybody with me he was Alpha
[40:09] and Omega and of course all in between
[40:11] now see we can't discount the Holy Ghost
[40:14] was in every age but they had a dip into
[40:16] the Holy Ghost it wasn't all of it you
[40:18] they had the Holy Ghost opened that part
[40:21] back there and it also opened this part
[40:24] up here right Alpha and Omega but then
[40:26] it took a prophet to come at the end of
[40:29] that Pentecostal age and
[40:31] declare Pentecost loved him when he was
[40:35] doing the signs and the Wonders come on
[40:38] some of you were sitting there wanted to
[40:40] see them signs and wonders wanted to see
[40:41] that calling out and telling people and
[40:44] and you know cancer falling off and all
[40:46] that but when brother R stood and said
[40:47] you Pentecostals are
[40:50] wrong the initial evidence is not
[40:52] speaking in
[40:54] tongues out the door he went
[40:57] but he couldn't say anything different
[40:58] than what God told him to say neither
[41:01] could Paul they were yielded Paul was a
[41:04] prisoner to Christ brother Brandon was a
[41:07] prisoner to Christ oh he could have been
[41:09] a millionaire he could have had the
[41:10] biggest church ever was if he' had
[41:13] compromised just a little bit oh yeah
[41:15] but praise God he didn't praise God he
[41:18] stood out yes and got away from all that
[41:21] he came out of her my people that's
[41:23] right and be not be partakers of her
[41:27] plagued but he specifically said Alpha
[41:30] and Omega had a rainbow over his head
[41:32] which is Covenant now if you notice the
[41:34] light of Pentecost where it started
[41:36] gradually smothered out right so when
[41:39] Paul comes on the scene the Pentecost
[41:42] was gradually smothering out they were
[41:44] and I'll read it here in just a minute
[41:45] what Paul talks about it then you say
[41:47] brother Brown the same way right what do
[41:50] he tell them he said Stay Together stay
[41:52] one yeah stay one no he said now now
[41:56] you're Church of God Church of God of
[41:58] Jesus Christ uh you know Jehovah's
[42:01] Witness you're you're now Church of
[42:03] Christ and Church of God and church of
[42:05] this and Church of that and First United
[42:07] Pentecostal they just start splitting up
[42:10] that's not God God don't split up Satan
[42:12] splits and divides
[42:14] right so let's read this to the angel of
[42:17] the Church of Ephesus write these things
[42:19] sayth he that holdeth the Seven Stars in
[42:21] his right hand I want listen I don't go
[42:24] by feelings but that gives me culture
[42:27] to know that God's going to get this and
[42:29] he's got it handled he brought the
[42:31] people it's not for us to question who
[42:34] brother Brandon was he was the messenger
[42:37] that God used to bring himself to you
[42:40] yes sir I said himself not William brand
[42:43] himself Christ yes sir to you and what
[42:46] to get it right right they didn't have
[42:50] it right we have it right yes sir we
[42:53] have information amen that nobody else
[42:56] had and what do we do with it sometimes
[42:59] we use it in the wrong way Amen to the
[43:03] angel of the Church of Ephesus write
[43:04] these things sayith he that holdeth the
[43:05] Seven Stars in his right hand he's going
[43:07] to have it he's going to have a church
[43:10] yes whether we want one or
[43:12] not who walketh in the midst of the
[43:14] seven golden counter sticks I Know Thy
[43:16] works and thy labor and thy patience
[43:20] he's giving them some some
[43:22] admonition and how they can't not bear
[43:24] them which are evil and thou Hast tried
[43:27] them which say they are Apostles and are
[43:28] not and have found them Liars people
[43:31] like sthus and different ones the
[43:33] discernment even Anan and Safar we were
[43:35] talking about last night that was a
[43:36] discernment and brother Brown said if
[43:38] that discernment was in that age it's
[43:40] going to be in our age where you sit in
[43:42] a congregation you got sin in your life
[43:44] God called it out if you don't repent
[43:46] you'll
[43:47] die I'm just telling you what brother L
[43:49] said I read it to you last night at
[43:52] ananas and Safar is coming right back
[43:54] into the church to do what clean up the
[43:58] church praise God God can't move in an
[44:01] unclean
[44:05] church we either get it
[44:07] right remember scripture tells us that
[44:09] there'll be a time when the sinner can't
[44:11] sit in the congregation of the
[44:13] righteous it's hard to do it now you see
[44:15] them fetting like
[44:18] crazy but what about when your sin's
[44:20] called out from the pull pit oh you'll
[44:22] hate somebody
[44:25] then
[44:27] we'll look at Paul Paul turns around he
[44:29] looked at that that person followed Paul
[44:32] around who was it some one of them
[44:33] followed him around the whole time
[44:35] finally after about 10
[44:37] days he said thou vile
[44:40] Spirit get out of here right has borne
[44:44] and has patience and for my name has
[44:45] labored and hasth not fainted
[44:48] nevertheless I have somewhat against
[44:49] thee because thou Hast left thy first
[44:52] love that was a question last night
[44:53] someone asked what does it mean by left
[44:55] your First Love well you become cold
[44:59] indifferent
[45:02] formal lovers are pleasure more than
[45:04] lovers of
[45:06] God even under the power of the Holy
[45:08] Ghost we can backslide hello
[45:12] somebody even under the power of the
[45:13] Holy Ghost you can backslide cuz we do
[45:16] all the time I hate to announce that but
[45:20] if I need to it again we
[45:22] backslide remember therefore from when
[45:25] thou art Fallen so
[45:28] remember what the prophet
[45:30] said and repent and do the first works
[45:32] or else I will come unto the quickly and
[45:34] will remove that Candlestick out of its
[45:36] place you see how horrible that is if
[45:38] God pulls that Candlestick up he's cut
[45:41] the Holy Ghost off from you that's right
[45:43] cuz that's what that oil means is the
[45:45] holy ghost coming up into each
[45:47] Candlestick and he said if you don't
[45:49] repent I'm pulling your Candlestick out
[45:52] H except thou repent but this thou Hast
[45:55] that thou hatest the Deeds of the
[45:57] nicians which I also hate and we know
[46:00] Deeds are undertaking or an act and
[46:03] letin niik means Victory or conquer
[46:06] that's where the word Nike comes from on
[46:08] your shoes and lean means members are
[46:11] Ley so Satan come in to conquer the
[46:14] leoty God was trying to free the
[46:17] leoty so God comes in and conquers the
[46:20] Ley brings in an
[46:22] idea contrary to God right and that's
[46:26] where you get denominations or you get
[46:28] hirings like balam was bam was a hiring
[46:32] prophet he got paid to do what he
[46:35] did that's right against God
[46:39] right Peter left it alone he'd have been
[46:41] all right but what do you do he said I
[46:42] can only say What God Says but I know
[46:45] how to get them oh he got them to
[46:48] mingling what do you do he got to
[46:50] mingling in the world just like just
[46:51] like the just like people in the pull
[46:53] pits brother R said what's the problem
[46:54] weak pull pits amen we pull pets I mean
[46:58] the Baptist don't tell you you need to
[47:00] dress right like you all are sitting
[47:02] here today they a I don't think there's
[47:04] a Baptist Church that that preaches
[47:06] holding this
[47:07] anymore Methodist sure don't lutherans
[47:09] don't care if you're woman male or
[47:11] female or whatever preaching you see how
[47:15] it
[47:16] went that's why this age is the darkest
[47:19] age because God said I've give you
[47:21] everything you need and you turn it down
[47:24] yes sir amen right you have more than
[47:27] just this for Access absolutely you have
[47:30] 1100 Ser well not my this watch but the
[47:32] other you got 1100 sermons on your arm
[47:34] right now if you got an Apple Watch you
[47:36] can you can got a quote for
[47:41] that but what have we done with it
[47:43] where's the
[47:44] life where's the consecrated life that
[47:47] we we need to get back to that why we've
[47:50] lost our first love we come to we come
[47:53] to the church and and we get all
[47:55] revelated and we don't have to live it
[47:57] no that's not
[48:01] true they seem to have held that it was
[48:04] lawful to eat things sacrificed to Idols
[48:06] in other words they brought a Doctrine
[48:07] in that was different than what God had
[48:10] said and then what they done was is they
[48:11] said oh you can't understand this okay
[48:15] Catholics did I see all the different
[48:17] they said you can't understand this so
[48:20] we'll just read it to you in Latin and
[48:22] you just do this and we'll do the
[48:24] incense and we'll do the what no Venus
[48:27] and then we'll do the confession
[48:30] box we'll come to find out that you were
[48:33] confessing to a priest that was a
[48:35] pedophile that's exactly
[48:38] right it's what you get when you turn
[48:40] away from the word of God listen they
[48:43] say Peter was the first pope right ain't
[48:45] that right they say Peter he had a
[48:48] wife he had a
[48:53] wife but the Catholic Church going to be
[48:56] so holy till they told the priest no you
[48:58] don't don't have no wife well you see
[49:00] what it turned out to
[49:01] be right so praise God for the
[49:05] truth praise God for the truth
[49:09] right till the alpha church is born
[49:12] Jesus tells them said it's not for you
[49:14] to know the times or seasons in other
[49:15] words they said when you going to
[49:16] restore this when you going to do that
[49:17] see that's the same way with brother
[49:18] brandom cuz even brother randam I don't
[49:21] say he got caught up in anything but he
[49:22] did get he did get caught up in there
[49:25] there's a Rapture coming I know I'm
[49:27] preaching something that's going to
[49:29] bring the Rapture all right right any
[49:32] day now then when the seals open he
[49:35] thought he had preached everything but
[49:37] he had just started his ministry so he
[49:40] comes into a New and Living Way called
[49:43] the
[49:45] seals ybody with me on that but he
[49:48] thought he preached everything spoke
[49:50] words we seed he said God I've got my
[49:51] own the Lim I preached everything you
[49:52] told me to preach he said oh don't worry
[49:55] God said no don't worry Malachi 4 has
[49:56] not been even fulfilled yet Malachi 4
[49:58] all you've done is the first part you
[50:00] restored them back to the alpha bride
[50:03] but now you got to take this group of
[50:05] people and take them to a body
[50:07] change what one of the questions last
[50:09] night was what is rapturing faith we
[50:11] didn't get to that but maybe get to it
[50:13] next time maybe let Bob explain it for
[50:21] him two months I I want y'all to start
[50:25] helping me a little bit so we'll talk
[50:27] about it but but I I don't like talking
[50:29] all the time I know that's hard for
[50:31] y'all to
[50:35] understand gosh we do make mistakes up
[50:40] here I got a little quote here says you
[50:43] will learn nothing from life if you
[50:44] think you're right all the time please
[50:46] help me with that that's right please
[50:49] help me with that you will learn nothing
[50:52] from life if you think you're right all
[50:54] the time
[50:56] I am not right all the time but I know
[50:59] one it is God's
[51:02] right and all we got to do is put our
[51:04] let the sufficiency be on him bringing
[51:07] it to us through the fivefold ministry
[51:10] not just one person we're a team we're
[51:13] we're we're we don't we have different
[51:15] like Matthew Mark Luke and John was a
[51:16] different view of the same thing but yet
[51:18] it was the Eternal Word of God even
[51:21] though Mark or one of them left out one
[51:23] man right one saw two Blind Men one saw
[51:26] one blind man it was the same scenario
[51:29] right but it was the same what Essence
[51:32] our ministers here in this church I
[51:34] believe we have the same
[51:36] essence of this message that we can
[51:39] bring it in a way that that this one can
[51:41] help more than this one can and I praise
[51:43] God for that yes
[51:45] sir amen Lord I'll give the
[51:49] Lord cuz it takes a fivefold Ministry
[51:51] it's not one
[51:53] person and I'll promise you I really
[51:55] really don't like to talk that
[51:58] much at night while I'm
[52:01] asleep Michael's
[52:06] going bless you buddy love you acts 1
[52:09] ver7 Jesus is telling them said look
[52:12] it's not for you to know all that times
[52:14] and seasons and stuff just hang on Amen
[52:18] the father's going to bring you power
[52:20] amen but you shall receive power after
[52:22] that the Holy Ghost has come upon you in
[52:24] other words there's going to be a
[52:26] transition period here there's going to
[52:28] be a dispensational change from the Old
[52:31] Testament cuz right here he's fixing to
[52:33] go home he's already conquered death
[52:36] he's already in a glorified body he's
[52:39] already part of the New Testament yes he
[52:41] is right then but still they didn't none
[52:44] of them get saved while he was going up
[52:46] right right but they sure got saved when
[52:49] he came down 120 of them amen but you
[52:53] shall receive power after that the Holy
[52:54] Ghost is come upon you and you shall be
[52:56] Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem
[52:58] Judea Samaria uttermost parts of the
[53:00] earth then we know a cloud received him
[53:03] up out of sight and we know that the
[53:05] cloud he came back in a
[53:07] cloud to get us this same Jesus which
[53:10] you see is taken into heaven shall so
[53:12] come in like manner as you have seen him
[53:13] go into heaven the only problem man has
[53:18] is they're looking for the physical
[53:20] Jesus
[53:22] man right all when we see him in the
[53:24] cloud of Glory when the Skies open up
[53:27] Bible tells us that the Eastern Sky
[53:30] opens up and he's coming down you know
[53:32] what that's what they were looking for
[53:34] the
[53:35] Messiah because they were listen they
[53:37] were persecuted by
[53:39] Romans the Jews in Jerusalem were not
[53:43] free people right they had to do what
[53:46] Rome
[53:48] said and they were expecting the Messiah
[53:50] to come in and just
[53:52] go and there goes all the Romans right
[53:55] the only time that's going to happen is
[53:57] when we go into the new city a won't be
[53:59] no Romans falling us into that new city
[54:01] I promise you that but even in the
[54:03] Millennium the devil's still
[54:05] alive when he's dead I'll be real
[54:09] happy
[54:10] ecstatic right well some of y'all must
[54:13] like him CU don't I wouldn't go if I was
[54:15] y'all I wouldn't go to his funeral I
[54:17] promise you that I'm just glad when he
[54:19] dies and goes into that Lake of Fire cuz
[54:21] he's tormented all of us too long but we
[54:24] have a
[54:26] promise with our children that we'll be
[54:29] there with them all right Luke 24:46
[54:33] says thus it is written and thus it
[54:34] behoove Christ to suffer and to rise
[54:36] from the dead the third day that
[54:38] repentance and remission of sins should
[54:39] be preached in his name among all the
[54:41] nations beginning at Jerusalem and ye
[54:43] are witnesses of these things and behold
[54:45] I send the promise of my father upon you
[54:47] but tar you in the city of Jerusalem
[54:49] until you be endued with power from on
[54:51] high and then we know the Holy Ghost
[54:53] fell on the day of Pentecost and that
[54:55] was the father's throne coming into
[54:57] being where you and I now that there we
[55:00] are we are there heirs and Joint HS with
[55:02] Christ but remember he's not sitting on
[55:04] his throne now this is important right
[55:08] he's sitting on the father's Throne
[55:09] which is the Holy Ghost which is the
[55:11] intercessor for me and you we need an
[55:13] intercessor yes sir even though we are
[55:16] Christians we still need an intercessor
[55:19] we still need to say God forgive me of
[55:21] what I just
[55:23] did and think listen
[55:25] thank God he gave you the attitude to do
[55:29] that most
[55:32] don't the word I'm sorry doesn't connect
[55:35] to people in the world
[55:37] anymore it's all your
[55:41] fault but when the day of Pentecost come
[55:43] listen they
[55:46] knew that there was a power that came to
[55:49] them that even with Jesus there and even
[55:52] with I was watching um or listening no
[55:54] watching brother bis was telling his um
[55:57] testimony years ago like in the '90s at
[56:00] some camp meeting and it came up on
[56:01] YouTube and I was watching it and and
[56:03] you know he's talking about that picture
[56:05] that's in there that where brother
[56:06] brandham they took a picture and of him
[56:08] at the campfire he said brother brandham
[56:10] was set up against a tree and go to
[56:11] sleep take like brother Bisal said I'll
[56:14] take the first you know four or five
[56:15] hours you sleep rest and then you get up
[56:17] and I'll sleep he said when brother R
[56:20] got up wasn't there wasn't no shouting
[56:22] there wasn't no praising God there
[56:23] wasn't even he said probably wasn't even
[56:25] Bible around
[56:26] nowhere but when brother random comes up
[56:28] and you see that picture in there where
[56:30] he's he's you know stoking the fire
[56:33] brother bisco said he went over and sat
[56:34] down against the same
[56:36] tree and he said there was a power came
[56:39] upon him he'd never felt in his life
[56:42] just the presence of that
[56:44] man just the presence to be sitting
[56:46] there in the same place he
[56:49] sat you know what that man's gone now
[56:52] but that presence is not that's right
[56:55] listen let me tell you something about
[56:56] the prophet of God you you give me about
[56:58] two minutes to tell you what's going on
[56:59] here he always listen the Shak Glory was
[57:03] never seen because remember in the Old
[57:05] Testament if you saw the Shak glory and
[57:08] you weren't right you
[57:10] died no if hands or buts no intercessor
[57:13] you passed away right now where is that
[57:17] light now we have a prophet in the end
[57:20] time and listen that Shak kind of Glory
[57:24] didn't wasn't in one wasn't in wasn't in
[57:28] Jeffersonville it was with the prophet
[57:31] he' go to Derman South Africa and he say
[57:34] don't you see that
[57:36] light come on he go to Italy don't you
[57:40] see that light he go to Germany don't
[57:43] you see that
[57:45] light that was a shic the glory of God
[57:48] following the prophet making sure that
[57:51] he preached the right doctrine that he
[57:54] serve the people like he's supposed to
[57:56] God listen when you got God when God got
[57:59] you in his
[58:01] hand Satan can't pull you out amen but
[58:05] that thing followed him everywhere he
[58:06] went he said can't you see that light
[58:07] 1950 they took a picture of that light
[58:10] that was the same listen if we believe
[58:12] in one God that's the same Angel The
[58:14] Covenant brother R said the same one
[58:17] that was in the pillar of fire the same
[58:19] one that was in the Shak Glory was now
[58:22] following a prophet around well you know
[58:24] what that your kind of Glory is not in
[58:26] the grave in Jeffersonville it's right
[58:28] here today if you'll accept it and
[58:30] believe
[58:32] it when you walk in the door you say
[58:35] can't you see that
[58:37] light oh I don't believe that I I don't
[58:40] I believe that just that went away with
[58:42] brother Brandon well you're
[58:44] lost amen you're
[58:48] lost that didn't go away you can't
[58:50] diminish
[58:52] God to me now it's in Ministry all over
[58:55] the country it said ministers all over
[58:58] the
[58:59] world that same Shak kind of Glory even
[59:03] being
[59:04] photographed from different places
[59:06] around but it's the same one same one
[59:08] Moses dealt with same one brother Brown
[59:10] dealt with same one me and you going to
[59:12] deal with and I pray this is kind of
[59:14] glories over all of us to keep this
[59:15] thing right to keep us Sanctified and
[59:18] and to keep us preaching the message of
[59:20] the hour the way it's supposed to be and
[59:22] make brother Brandon proud now you know
[59:24] what make God proud but I'd like to make
[59:26] brother R proud he give his heart and
[59:28] life for
[59:29] this and died for
[59:35] this sorry about
[59:38] [Music]
[59:40] that so the way that Pentecost
[59:43] came then is the way it's come
[59:47] now we had an isua Street Pentecost I'll
[59:50] get to it in just a minute I got to flip
[59:51] through some of this
[59:53] stuff
[59:56] that day of Pentecost there was a sound
[59:58] of a a mighty Russian wind and and they
[1:00:01] spoke in other tongues and and remember
[1:00:03] they it was the hearing they heard him
[1:00:05] in other languages well now when you
[1:00:07] come over to the zeusa street it brought
[1:00:09] that GI those gifts back all right but
[1:00:12] it didn't take them all the way as
[1:00:13] brother Ram says many times he said it
[1:00:15] didn't bring them all the way out it
[1:00:17] didn't take them completely out they was
[1:00:18] still a piece left because listen God's
[1:00:21] not going to bring and and anoint a
[1:00:24] father Holy Ghost Doctrine he
[1:00:27] can't he can't anoint a false
[1:00:31] Doctrine so when he comes out that false
[1:00:34] Doctrine got to stay
[1:00:36] there that's why the Bible says come out
[1:00:38] of her my
[1:00:41] people this is kind of the some of the
[1:00:43] things that happened on the de on on
[1:00:45] through Pentecost if you would read the
[1:00:46] book of Acts that is the Acts of the
[1:00:48] Apostles is how they
[1:00:50] acted and they contined steadfast in the
[1:00:53] apostles Doctrine and fellowship ship
[1:00:54] see they didn't have a
[1:00:57] problem with Apostles prophets pastors
[1:01:00] teachers and evangelists all
[1:01:02] right you know all the there there's a
[1:01:04] lot of people that don't take communion
[1:01:06] anymore in the message because they
[1:01:09] said Jesus said do this till I come so
[1:01:13] in 1963 they say he came well it's real
[1:01:16] strange that brother randam last night I
[1:01:17] read a quote from
[1:01:19] what the message communion he took
[1:01:22] communion in
[1:01:23] 1965 if he would have thought it was
[1:01:26] done in' 63 he'd have said no we ain't
[1:01:27] got to do this no more no them
[1:01:29] ordinances we still got do I love doing
[1:01:33] them if you're scared of them then get
[1:01:35] the Holy
[1:01:36] Ghost but they continue steadfast in the
[1:01:39] apostles Doctrine and fellowship and in
[1:01:41] Breaking of bread and in prayer and fear
[1:01:43] Came Upon every soul and Many Wonders
[1:01:45] and signs were done by the apostles and
[1:01:47] all that believe were together and had
[1:01:49] all things common sold their possessions
[1:01:51] and goods and parted them to all men as
[1:01:53] every man had need and they continually
[1:01:56] daily with one ACC corn in the temple
[1:01:58] and breaking bread they went to church
[1:02:00] breaking bread from house to house did
[1:02:02] eat their meat with gladness and
[1:02:03] singleness of heart praising God and
[1:02:06] having favor with all the people and the
[1:02:08] Lord added to the church daily such you
[1:02:10] should be saved act 3:4 it says Peter
[1:02:14] fast his eyes upon him talking about the
[1:02:16] man that gate beautiful says look on us
[1:02:19] and he gave heed unto them expecting to
[1:02:20] receive something of them in other words
[1:02:21] he was expecting Peter to bring him a
[1:02:23] little little gift you know well he
[1:02:25] brought him a gift all right but it
[1:02:27] wasn't one this man i' had ever seen in
[1:02:28] his life then Peter said Silver and Gold
[1:02:30] Have I None but such as I have give I
[1:02:32] Thee in the name of Jesus Christ of
[1:02:34] Nazareth rise up and walk and he took
[1:02:36] him by the right hand and lifted him up
[1:02:38] and immediately his feet and ankle bones
[1:02:40] receive strength we saw that even in
[1:02:41] brother bram's Ministry remember the
[1:02:43] little boy that came on the platform I
[1:02:45] can't remember what country he's from
[1:02:46] but his feet were bowed in and and all
[1:02:49] that and club fooot and then all of a
[1:02:51] sudden he prayed for them and they were
[1:02:53] straight
[1:02:55] right well miracles must not excite
[1:02:58] y'all I tell you if you're not getting
[1:03:00] used to them you'll be scared of them
[1:03:06] am he said they had all things
[1:03:09] common is it common for us to see
[1:03:13] Miracles or are we scared of God we are
[1:03:15] we scared of somebody to discern my life
[1:03:18] your life right do we not show up for
[1:03:21] church one day if we have a prophet in
[1:03:23] bring a prophet in here well anyway see
[1:03:26] that's what I mean though we got to keep
[1:03:27] Church clean cuz one unconfessed
[1:03:30] sin right can cause the whole church to
[1:03:33] bitterly
[1:03:35] fail bitterly fail brother R said we
[1:03:38] still believe it was a prophet right
[1:03:40] okay all right but listen he put gifts
[1:03:42] in the church to do what keep the church
[1:03:43] clean right and when brother Bob gets on
[1:03:46] to y'all about certain things when I do
[1:03:47] it when brother Lis and with brother
[1:03:49] Aaron it's God trying to get us straight
[1:03:53] now right
[1:03:56] absolutely you remember one time who was
[1:03:59] it one of the
[1:04:00] prophets he said God have turned me
[1:04:03] down God said no they're not turning you
[1:04:07] down they're turning me
[1:04:09] down if they preach the word of God if
[1:04:12] this vessel up here preaches the word of
[1:04:13] God you're not turning me down you're
[1:04:16] turning God down that's what happened
[1:04:17] ananas and Safar they didn't believe
[1:04:20] that those men were so full of the Holy
[1:04:22] Ghost that if they lied made a little
[1:04:23] bit of they could get by with it right
[1:04:27] they messed up bad they lost their life
[1:04:30] because of it all
[1:04:34] right now watch
[1:04:36] this and now Lord behold their
[1:04:38] threatenings and Grant unto thy servant
[1:04:40] that with all boldness they may speak
[1:04:42] Thy Word by stretching forth thine hand
[1:04:43] to heal and that signs and wonders may
[1:04:45] be done by the name of thy holy Child
[1:04:47] Jesus and when they had prayed the place
[1:04:49] was shaken where they were assembled
[1:04:51] together and they were all filled with
[1:04:53] the Holy Ghost and fake the word of God
[1:04:56] with boldness and the multitude of them
[1:04:57] that believe were of one heart and one
[1:04:59] Soul neither said any of them that ought
[1:05:01] of the things which he possessed was his
[1:05:03] own but they had all things common and
[1:05:06] with power great power gave the apostles
[1:05:09] witness of the resurrection of the Lord
[1:05:10] Jesus and great grace was upon them all
[1:05:13] now if that was the alpha
[1:05:15] Church were the Omega Church acts 5 and
[1:05:19] by the hand of the apostles were many
[1:05:21] signs and wonders wrought among the
[1:05:22] people and they were all with one Accord
[1:05:24] in Solomon's porch That's the temple if
[1:05:26] y'all didn't know that and of the rest D
[1:05:29] no man join himself to them there some
[1:05:30] scared people but the people magnified
[1:05:33] them and Believers were the more added
[1:05:35] to the Lord multitudes both of men and
[1:05:38] women in so much that they brought forth
[1:05:40] the sick into the street and laid them
[1:05:42] in beds and couches that it least the
[1:05:44] shadow of Peter passing by might
[1:05:46] overshadow some of them they came also a
[1:05:48] multitude out of the city round about to
[1:05:50] Jerusalem bringing sick folks and them
[1:05:52] which were vexed with unclean spirits
[1:05:53] and they they were healed
[1:05:56] everyone see brother Brown started that
[1:05:58] way healing
[1:06:00] campaign but when Peter and him got up
[1:06:02] and started preaching the word what
[1:06:04] happened to
[1:06:05] Steven Steven told them who they
[1:06:08] were and he died first
[1:06:12] martyr he stood up in church and
[1:06:15] preached him a sermon and they were the
[1:06:17] Bible say they were cut at their heart
[1:06:19] in other words they were going to kill
[1:06:20] that guy and they did am then they cried
[1:06:23] out with a loud voice and stopped their
[1:06:24] ears and ran upon him with one Accord
[1:06:27] and cast him out of the city and stoned
[1:06:28] him and the witnesses he right here
[1:06:31] Steven and the witnesses laid down their
[1:06:32] clothes at a young man's feet whose name
[1:06:34] was Saul this is f Saul Paul's first
[1:06:37] appearance in the scripture he was
[1:06:39] persecuting or or he was consenting that
[1:06:42] they persecute Christians I've said many
[1:06:45] times before we would not have picked
[1:06:48] all the people in the Bible that God
[1:06:50] picked we would not look at all of them
[1:06:52] and you're like no if I want to pick
[1:06:54] that one or not
[1:06:56] David all the different
[1:07:00] ones acts 8 verse4 therefore they all
[1:07:03] scattered abroad went everywhere
[1:07:04] preaching the word of God then Philip
[1:07:06] went down to the city of Samaria and
[1:07:07] preached Christ unto him now remember
[1:07:09] the Bible said brother R calls Philip a
[1:07:12] deacon and the people with one Accord
[1:07:14] gave heed unto those things which Philip
[1:07:16] spake hearing and seeing the Miracles
[1:07:17] which he did for unclean spirits crying
[1:07:20] with loud voices came out of many that
[1:07:22] were possessed with them and many taken
[1:07:23] with py that were lame they were healed
[1:07:26] and there was great joy in that city is
[1:07:29] there great joy in your city of what
[1:07:32] you're
[1:07:35] doing God help us all acts 8 ver9 but
[1:07:38] there was a certain man called Simon who
[1:07:40] beforehand in the same city used sorcery
[1:07:42] and bewitched the people of Samaria
[1:07:44] giving out that himself was some great
[1:07:46] one to whom they all gave heed from the
[1:07:49] least to the greatest saying this man is
[1:07:51] the great power of God now this was a
[1:07:53] sorcerer
[1:07:54] right but he was fixing to meet the real
[1:07:56] God through a group of people and to him
[1:08:00] they had regard because that of long
[1:08:02] time he had Bewitched them with
[1:08:04] sorceries but when they believe philli
[1:08:06] preaching the things concer listen they
[1:08:08] didn't have a
[1:08:10] Bible they have an
[1:08:13] MP3 they believe what Philip told them
[1:08:16] cuz there was a connection there but
[1:08:19] when they believe Philip preaching the
[1:08:21] things concerning the kingdom of God in
[1:08:23] the name of Jesus Christ they were
[1:08:24] baptized both men and women then Simon
[1:08:27] himself believed also and he was
[1:08:30] baptized he just didn't go on he
[1:08:32] continued with Philip and wondered
[1:08:34] beholding the Miracles and signs which
[1:08:35] they were done now when the apostles
[1:08:37] were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had
[1:08:39] received the word of God they sent unto
[1:08:40] them Peter and John who when they were
[1:08:42] come down prayed for them that they
[1:08:44] might receive the Holy Ghost Now look
[1:08:45] for as yet he was Fallen upon none of
[1:08:47] them only they that were baptized in the
[1:08:49] name of the Lord Jesus then laid their
[1:08:52] hands on them and they received the Holy
[1:08:53] Ghost ghost and when Simon saw that
[1:08:55] through laying on the apostles hands the
[1:08:57] Holy Ghost was given he offered him
[1:08:59] money he wanted to buy his way
[1:09:01] in don't ever try to buy your way
[1:09:05] in if he had just stayed with the move
[1:09:07] of
[1:09:09] God he'd got the Holy Ghost I believe
[1:09:12] acts 8 ver 26 and the angel of the Lord
[1:09:15] spake unto Philip say arise go toward
[1:09:17] the South into a way that goeth down
[1:09:18] from Jerusalem to Gaza which is Desert
[1:09:21] now we know what this was we know this
[1:09:22] is an Ethiopian unic that was sitting on
[1:09:26] his Carriage reading the Bible reading
[1:09:28] the Old Testament and sitting in his
[1:09:31] Chariot read Isaiah the prophet then the
[1:09:32] spirit said unto Philip go near reason
[1:09:35] I'm reading this is I'm telling you this
[1:09:37] is the Acts of the Apostles in the alpha
[1:09:40] Church
[1:09:40] age this should be the Acts of the
[1:09:43] Apostles in the Omega Church
[1:09:49] age then the spirit said unto Philip go
[1:09:51] near and join thyself to this chariot
[1:09:54] and Philip ran thither to him and heard
[1:09:55] him read the prophet Isaiah and said
[1:09:57] understandeth thou what thou readest and
[1:09:59] he said how can I except son man guide
[1:10:01] me now he didn't read that he needed to
[1:10:04] listen to Apostle Prophet Pastor teacher
[1:10:06] and evangelist God was revealing through
[1:10:08] him to him that he needed somebody to
[1:10:11] tell him what was going
[1:10:12] on and he sent Philip to tell him and he
[1:10:15] desired Philip that he would come and
[1:10:17] sit with him the place of the scripture
[1:10:19] which you read was he was in other words
[1:10:21] Isaiah
[1:10:21] 53 right so the unic answered Philip and
[1:10:25] said I pray thee of whom speaketh this
[1:10:27] prophet of himself or some other man
[1:10:29] then Philip opened his mouth and began
[1:10:30] at the same scripture and preached unto
[1:10:32] him Jesus listen if Philip had not known
[1:10:34] Jesus right he couldn't have preached
[1:10:36] that message do you know Jesus today do
[1:10:39] you know Jesus enough you could tell
[1:10:40] somebody about him and they want to be
[1:10:43] baptized we all
[1:10:45] short and as they went on their way they
[1:10:48] came into a certain water and the unit
[1:10:49] said see here is water what does hinder
[1:10:51] me to be baptized and and Philip said if
[1:10:54] thou believest with all thine heart thou
[1:10:56] mayest and he answered and said I
[1:10:57] believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of
[1:11:00] God and he commanded the Chariot to
[1:11:02] stand still and they went down in the
[1:11:04] water and Philip and the unic and he
[1:11:06] baptized him and when they came
[1:11:08] up something
[1:11:11] happened Phillip got put in the
[1:11:13] transport
[1:11:16] room and got transferred a couple
[1:11:18] hundred miles to the next
[1:11:21] meeting Alpha Church
[1:11:26] Omega
[1:11:28] Church we get in the car and go
[1:11:31] now Philip was needed somewhere else so
[1:11:33] God sent him just teleported him over to
[1:11:35] another place talk about a body change
[1:11:39] that was temporary but he took one and
[1:11:41] he went on his way rejoicing but Philip
[1:11:43] was found in aotus aotus which was
[1:11:46] several hundred miles away and passing
[1:11:48] through he preached in all the cities
[1:11:49] till he came to
[1:11:51] cesaria so now we know one thing for
[1:11:54] sure Paul was the messenger to the
[1:11:58] Ephesian Church age it started in ad 53
[1:12:01] after that Pentecostal age started Paul
[1:12:05] comes on the scene rebukes the previous
[1:12:09] people from Pentecost all right then he
[1:12:12] brings his message and his
[1:12:15] message began in 853 when he set up
[1:12:19] Ephesus the church at Ephesus and then
[1:12:22] he brought his message now remember Paul
[1:12:24] died in ad. 65 or 66 so he didn't live
[1:12:28] hardly any part through that church age
[1:12:30] but the message was so powerful are we
[1:12:33] getting this the message was so powerful
[1:12:35] that a group of people picked that
[1:12:37] message up and they swept it on to the
[1:12:40] next Church age we're going to sweep it
[1:12:42] on to the coming of the
[1:12:43] Lord
[1:12:46] Hall so Paul founded the church at
[1:12:49] Ephesus about the middle of the first
[1:12:50] century this enables us to set the date
[1:12:53] 8 8 53 is what brother BR says let's
[1:12:55] continue let me skip through here just
[1:12:57] for a second now watch this nevertheless
[1:13:00] I have someone against thee because thou
[1:13:02] has left thy first love this is God
[1:13:04] telling John the Revelator to write this
[1:13:06] down and send it to the church this is
[1:13:08] what's going to happen to
[1:13:10] you Matthew 7:15 Jesus had already told
[1:13:13] him he said look beware of false
[1:13:15] prophets which come to you in sheep's
[1:13:18] clothing but inwardly they are ravening
[1:13:21] wolves Matthew 10 verse 16 Jesus said
[1:13:24] behold I send you forth as sheep in the
[1:13:27] midst of wolves be ye therefore wise as
[1:13:30] serpents and harmless as
[1:13:34] doves the key given un to me to the Lord
[1:13:36] this is Brother Ry we'll we'll stop here
[1:13:38] and pick it up this afternoon had got to
[1:13:40] Paul yet but we'll get to him it's the
[1:13:42] Revelation that God never changes and
[1:13:44] that his ways are as unchangeable as he
[1:13:46] is here it is an unchangeable god with
[1:13:49] unchangeable ways what he did at the
[1:13:52] first he'll have to keep keep doing
[1:13:53] until it's done for the last time there
[1:13:55] will never be a change apply that to the
[1:13:58] church ages the kind of man that God
[1:14:00] chose for the first age and how God
[1:14:02] manifested in that man's Ministry would
[1:14:05] be the example for all other ages what
[1:14:09] God did in the first church age is what
[1:14:11] he wants to do in all other
[1:14:14] ages now we know exactly from the word
[1:14:16] which was recorded by the Holy Ghost how
[1:14:18] Holy Spirit how the first original
[1:14:20] church was founded and how God
[1:14:21] manifested himself in her
[1:14:24] the word can't change or be changed
[1:14:26] because it's the word of God thus what
[1:14:28] the church was at Pentecost is the
[1:14:30] standard all right there's your that's
[1:14:32] standard over there on the side of the
[1:14:35] picture we showed you all right that is
[1:14:38] the pattern there's no other pattern no
[1:14:40] matter what the scholars say God has not
[1:14:41] changed that pattern what God did at
[1:14:43] Pentecost he has to keep on doing until
[1:14:45] the church age closes that original
[1:14:48] church was not organized by men it was
[1:14:51] led by the Holy Ghost it wasn't very
[1:14:53] very big it was hated and despised it
[1:14:55] was oppressed it was persecuted unto
[1:14:57] death but it was true to God it stayed
[1:14:59] with the original word pattern now what
[1:15:01] happened after that though they got away
[1:15:03] from the original word pattern that's
[1:15:06] why that the messenger over here of
[1:15:08] Elijah had to what restore the faith of
[1:15:11] the fathers restore what was in the
[1:15:12] first church
[1:15:14] age now don't get LED astray here when I
[1:15:18] said that God and his ways never
[1:15:19] changeed I did not say that the church
[1:15:21] and its Messengers could not change
[1:15:23] the church isn't God so she can change
[1:15:26] but what I said was that because of the
[1:15:28] unchanging God with unchanging ways we
[1:15:30] can go back to the beginning and see the
[1:15:33] first and perfect ACT of God and then
[1:15:35] judge by that standard that is how it's
[1:15:38] done the true church will always try to
[1:15:39] be like the original at Pentecost the
[1:15:42] true church of today will try to
[1:15:44] approximate that early first one and The
[1:15:47] Messengers to the church having the same
[1:15:49] spirit of God in them will try to
[1:15:50] approximate the Apostle Paul they won't
[1:15:53] be exactly like him but the true
[1:15:55] Messengers will be the ones that come
[1:15:56] the closest to Paul who was free of all
[1:15:59] men sold out to God and gave forth the
[1:16:00] word of God only and manifested the Holy
[1:16:03] Ghost in power none else would do you
[1:16:06] have to work from the original as like
[1:16:09] begs like the true church will always be
[1:16:11] the one that tries to follow in the
[1:16:13] steps of her Founders at Pentecost and
[1:16:16] her Messengers will follow the Apostle
[1:16:18] Paul the first messenger of the first
[1:16:20] church age it's that simple and that
[1:16:21] wonderful why brother Brown when he got
[1:16:23] occur of time he didn't say did irenius
[1:16:25] make it he didn't say did Luther make it
[1:16:28] he said Paul make it angel said yeah
[1:16:31] Paul made it he said well if Paul made
[1:16:32] it then I'll make it cuz I preached
[1:16:35] exactly what Paul preached remember all
[1:16:37] the whole host of Heaven said we're
[1:16:39] resting on that and today we're resting
[1:16:41] on that that we are not
[1:16:44] just a
[1:16:47] church we're the
[1:16:49] bride we have the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:16:52] amen and let me let me let you in on a
[1:16:54] little
[1:16:55] secret as your bride is your bride and
[1:16:58] you share secrets and you share things
[1:17:00] that that you don't share with anybody
[1:17:03] else you you love each other more than
[1:17:06] anybody else everybody with
[1:17:08] me God does the same
[1:17:11] thing he's going to take care of his
[1:17:14] wife he gave his life for us why don't
[1:17:17] we just give a piece of it back to him
[1:17:19] just a piece of it back to him let's
[1:17:21] stand our feet let's just give a piece
[1:17:22] to him
[1:17:23] all right listen he knows we have to
[1:17:26] work he knows we get tired he knows that
[1:17:29] he knew it before the foundation of the
[1:17:30] world but I'll promise you he made
[1:17:32] Provisions for all
[1:17:34] that right he left no one wanting
[1:17:37] anything if the want is toward him
[1:17:41] amen but if we decide to interject our
[1:17:43] own feelings into it or or whatever then
[1:17:45] that's not
[1:17:51] God this his first church age messenger
[1:17:54] look how he started out as for Saul he
[1:17:57] made Havoc of the church entered in
[1:18:01] every
[1:18:01] house and hailing men and women
[1:18:04] committing them to
[1:18:07] prison he hated this move of God called
[1:18:13] Christianity hated
[1:18:15] it but God said oh wait a minute I
[1:18:19] there's something in
[1:18:20] you there's something in you I'm going
[1:18:23] to
[1:18:24] use I say to each and every one of you I
[1:18:26] hope God finds something in each and
[1:18:27] every one of you to use whether you feel
[1:18:31] insignificant or you feel like you're
[1:18:32] not this or not that if you're here
[1:18:35] today God's got something for you God's
[1:18:38] got something for you but you know what
[1:18:40] he's not going to shove it down your
[1:18:41] throat that's one thing God won't
[1:18:43] do he will not shove it down your throat
[1:18:46] he will give it to you hand it to you
[1:18:48] and say here it is and you got to accept
[1:18:51] it I pray that we all accept all the
[1:18:53] parts of life if you're already Born
[1:18:54] Again accept the other part the
[1:18:57] manifestation of gifts and wisdom and
[1:18:59] knowledge and all those different things
[1:19:01] are are even speaking in tongues and the
[1:19:03] different things I would to God that we
[1:19:04] have that in order because it's part of
[1:19:07] the church all right it's not some
[1:19:09] fanaticism if it's done right is
