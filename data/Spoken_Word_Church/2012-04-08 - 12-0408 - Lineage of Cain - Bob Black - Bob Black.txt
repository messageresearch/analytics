TRANSCRIPT
========================================
this beautiful Easter Moon guess where we're going to be reading from we're almost done I don't know this is for 17. and this is starting the lineage of King so what I wanted to do as we go through the lineage obtain just to look at what the names of all of his uh descendants mean because the names and the people of the people in the Old Testament have I mean the people in Old Desmond gave their children names that meant something about who they were and what happened when they were born and um so in the verses before we saw how Cain left the presence of the Lord and he went out and became a Wanderer and that's how it is when we leave the president anyone that leaves the presence of the Lord they don't know where they're going don't know where they came from um I remember looking at his school we looked at this painting that a famous painter made that it was talking about where who are we where did we come from and they just don't know where what's going on so let's as we go down through the list let's take a look at each of the meanings of the names let's start at verse 17 and Cain knew his wife and she can see and bear Enoch and he built the city and call the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch so he dedicated the city to Enoch and that's what Enoch means and you know there's an Enoch but the seventh from Adam was evening and there's also this is a different name we're talking about just to be clear this can be a little bit confusing so Enoch means dedicated or initiated I skipped somebody let's go back to King what's cane mean Kane means position or required because you've said I've gotten a man from the Lord she she thought that she had acquired a man from the Lord but we know that nobody can be born unless the God allows it so in that sense he was from the Lord um but he wasn't the promise seed that she was looking for and unto Enoch was born Iraq and Iran to get Methuselah and methusel to get my neck so Euro means Fugitive because they have delanians have become a fugitive from all over but all means Smitten by God or destroyed of God methusiomes I am a mortal where is God I am Immortal Immortal a Immortal I am a mortal and to find the meaning that I compared Strong's Concordance and um this website I found that takes the Hebrew roots and looks at what the Hebrew parts of the word you know like El means god and breaks it down and um you know Strong's Concordia says that my enthuselah for example means who is of God but if you break down a different Hebrew Parts it becomes I am a moral where is God and limit now we talked briefly about him earlier that Lemay was a he's a classic example of the Rebel who's lean from God and he became a murderer he took um Vengeance into his own hands and said well Cain is going to be of any Sevenfold without being said anytime soon and um so he he murdered someone that will read a little bit further along with um treated it did something evil to lame he took Venus against him so lamech is a rebel he's the first one in the Bible we're a quarter to um take more than one wife uh first this was a second murderer I mean he had a spirit of this I'm going to do whatever I want to lamech means for lowering for humiliation and the strongest concorda says that means shade so he took two wives let's read verse 19. now lamech took unto him two wives the name of the one was Ada in the name of the other Zillow I couldn't find one of those two names mean I ate a bear jobel now these are the three sons that kind of rhyme job and they all really mean the same thing they mean stream because from these three came streams of civilization that civil that in in what they represent you can see how uh man is getting away from God by building cities um let's take a closer look verse 20 into Ada Bell job he was the father of such as dwell intense and of such as half cattle so this can be a little confusing because you think okay well the Israelites well intense too what's so bad about that well it's think of it as a double is the the beginning of artificial shelter and livelihood building great cities building um but creating comfort for ourselves that allows us to get away from God you know we could recover should allow us to um to sit in the private comfort of our home and and listen to God's word and read our Bible but oftentimes it gets us further away from God you know we have a television set up in a house where I mean not me but in people your television can get you away from God and put something in front of you that it takes you further away from God so that's what job will represents a stream the beginning he says either the father of such as dwelling tennis and have cattle the beginning of artificial shelter and livelihood and let's see and his brother's name was Jubal he was the father of all such as Handel the heart in Oregon and that doesn't seem so bad at first glance because David played the harp and he brought the spirit when you know to go around talked about how that a menstrual brings the spirit of the Lord but this was really the beginning of musicals and artistic expression and um so I have some folks to read about that in a little bit about music but music can take you further away from God also and um and then of Zilla tubal was born an instructor of every artificial in brass and iron and two will represents the economy and interaction worldwide industry and manipulation of metals now this is interesting because if you remember your history in school the ironies began in 1200 BC this is what three thousand years before the Iron Iron Age was ever supposed to begin so this is this is an example of how we know the Bible is true you know people in school talk about how the early settlers didn't understand that the world was round the Bible talks about how the sphere of the Earth years before um we history says that we understood that the Earth was round um so tubal was already working an iron thousands of years before if you want to do any research on your own on Iron Age for uh history said it says that that should have happened solemax and his descendants represent Rebellion against God's word and decided he was just going to do whatever he wanted to do see what brother Randall says about civilization God's power to transform in 1965 he said civilization started Dr Scofield here in my Scofield bible it says the first civilization notice then he begot sons and they may orbit the music the next one we got son that he began to do other things the Wonder build cities and make instruments of brass and all kinds of things see that's what he did become the first civilization which was canine he's done the same thing down through the Yankees and uh the Raptors that we find out that in Genesis 4 the Cain's people started civilizations building towns and cities and so forth and instruments of music and becoming science and the people got further away from God yet religious but would assess people come on they begin to come on call on the name of the Lord Empower transformation he said now notice as soon as they went out from the presence of the Lord they started building cities they started making instruments they started in science to making grass and iron and playing music and so forth see now where did it come from juvenile came the circuit you understand it pain went out and noticed he went out from the presence of the Lord and started working in science now look where he is still working see science education cities culture it's of the devil who started it the devil who is it today the devil atomic bombs and things to destroy us we're reliving it we have to live here we ought to be and we have to stay here but God's Great civilization won't have any of that in it the science is taking the natural things and perverting it to do things that wasn't intended to do science is I was reading some things that different scientists have to say about science versus God and what scientist said that uh if you did away with all the religions in the world and did away with all the knowledge you'd still be able to prove science they take science and turn it into their God it's exactly the opposite of how we believe that if you took away everything if you blew up the world we still have the word to stand on because heaven and earth will pass away from our Lord will never pass away let's see Genesis chapter verse 23 24 and lament said unto his wives hear my voice you wise of the neck hearken unto my speech for I have slain a man to my willingness and a young man to my heart and we talked about that early with vengeance where we compare the container's prayer in psalm 79. where David was seeking the Lord to take ninjas instead of for himself and uh and you know misunderstood the Sevenfold protection of God is a right for him to just take matters in his own hands and kill whoever he thought did him wrong um and so let's talk about this for a second howl a Mac took two wives and just reviewed polygamy now I think I believe we all understand that pleasing is wrong let's take a look at the scripture um about what a lot of people do is um if you if you look at how people defend their faith if you look at the Catholics how they defend their faith they'll look at the writings of eusebius and um the uh origin or whatnot and they'll use that as an example of what they believe they'll use those writings and the same thing with the Jehovah's Witnesses or any any faith a lot of times message Believers will tend to instead of taking it back to the Bible you got to line up the message because the message was sent to shine a light on the scripture to open it up so we could understand scripture if you can't go back to the word and approve your your Doctrine or your belief by the word you might not have any you might be staring on sinking Sands so to find out where the polygamy is right we'll go back to the example that Paul said for us and Paul is such a great teacher he was taught by gamalia and he knew the word back and forth and uh so he understood scripture and if we you know when brother Reina went beyond the curtain of time they said we're resting on the fact that your message is built on Paul's message we're resting on that and so that's what we're we have great faith if we can say the same thing that Paul did in First Corinthians set of two he said nevertheless I'll just read you don't have to turn there nevertheless to avoid fornication let every man have his own life and let every woman have her own husband not wives or husbands but wife and husband and woman that's the yeah in first Timothy 3 1-2 talking about Bishops so Bishop then must be blameless the husband of one wife Vigilant sober of good behavior given to hospitality aptit teach and verse 12 let the deacons be the husbands of one wife ruling their children in their own house as well and I was reading what a uh a Mormon had to say about this and that Mormons to defend their faith they'll uh instead of what this should be is as a deacon or official is an example of how everyone should live their life the Deacon has married to one wife because if you're married at all you should have one wife not more than one wife the Mormons say that the Deacon has a special case that is outside of the normal operation of most people that um or this particular moment it might I guess you could say not every moment maybe but this particular moment that I was reading what he said said that uh a deacon or a bishop that Paul's speaking of is not an example for how able Believers live but that's not true that Titus 1-6 and Elder must be blameless faithful to his wife a man whose children believe and are not open to the charge of being Wild and this would be it and I was reading this morning about uh Martin Luther I guess one of the one thing that they always Roman Catholics and whatnot try always bring against Martin Luther is this story of Philip there was a man named Phillip who tell you the story he got married to a woman that he found unattractive after he got married somehow I I don't really understand how how he ended up married to or whatnot but after he married her he uh decided he didn't like her too much so like a year after he got married he he went into adultery and that kind of thing and started to uh he started reading the writings of the Wittenberg Martin Luther and and his friend Milan who um at the time he was helping Martin Luther there at Wittenberg and they both had written some things to kind of seem like it might be okay in certain circumstances to marry another wife for example Martin Luther said he felt like that um remember Martin Luther was a reformer not a prophet and he said that he felt like um if your wife was left for us or severely infirmed that it might be in certain circumstances okay to take a why but he advised Philip that you can't just look at the Patriarchs and say well because David had more than one wife I'm going to take a wife you have to you have to uh you have you will need a Divine uh call in your life from God and that's what Martin Luther told me um but what the root of the thing was that Philip had gone into adultery and he was looking at for an excuse to um an excuse for his lascivious behavior that was what was the root of the problem and um so the long story short he uh he ended up getting looser to and melanchon to to kind of uh in a private confessional a private situation say in certain circumstances it would I I believe it would be okay for you to get a little while this occurred after Philip had already arranged to marry someone else he already had it in mind he already had it all planned out and this was a it ended up being a big Mark against Martin Luther it turned into a huge thing throughout Germany all of the people in Germany were just outraged that Philip um ended up marrying a second wife ended up being a huge thing but you can see the root of polygamy as is uh to cover up licentious desires and the reason we don't do polygamy today is because of the New Covenant let me just read a few quotes that brother Brandon said now because you know Martin Luther was a reformer and he couldn't bring it out and mayor's in divorce I'm going to start with this one 1965 for the random takes it all the way back to the beginning where there was this man and a woman in the very beginning why how uh what happened he said now the world is to be repopulated after the fall not by the original creation of God like in the beginning not by the original creation but by sex desire now that takes the care of the beginning doesn't it so in the beginning there was going to be reproduction by spiritual reproduction just like now the New Covenant is reproduction by Spoken Word reproducing himself the bride is born by the word now that takes care of the beginning doesn't it in the beginning there was only one man and one woman one male and one female and when she crossed that line and brought us in our world is to be repopulated again by sex not by creation by sex see where the woman is at now but that's the way the world is populated today through women now remember Lemay he uh none of none of the children have said ever began to take more than one wife until after Genesis 9 when God came down and said um told Noah multiply and replace the Earth that was the second time he said multiply me please third first time was Genesis 1 26 27. in Genesis 9 he said multiplying replenish the Earth and he set up a new covenant word now and instead of in the in the evening they only ate vegetables now they can eat meat as long as they don't take it and we kind of discussed that last time now he and Genesis 9 he set up a new couple now by uh to multiply and replace the Earth with me that promise was over in 1965 marriage and divorce she said but when he was born into the creation of God who cannot die from that other tree that was in the Garden of Eden Christ eternal life to come by that tree price is true enough to put multiplication of Adam and Eve was through sex replace the Earth but it wasn't so at the beginning God just made a male and a female like he did as other creatures she legal just like the church and Hebrews chapter 7 1957 he said if I said tomorrow about my wife or well I'd like to have two wives I like to run around with this one do this one there but if I do my wife will divorce me and my kids will be in my ministry will be lost you dirty rotten hypocrite that's right you don't love her right in the first place it ain't right to take another wife even if like Martin Luther said even if she's uh he he thought it would be okay if she was lepers and whatnot but that's not right that's not true love until death do you part Jehovah Jireh 1955 he said look at the papers and things how they're packing how perversion people is on the move because men can't be satisfied with one life with one wife and he's looking he's living with everything every woman that he can run around with and women the same way and it's become just like the scene of Saul this is exactly what Phillips problem was he was uh problem was he's trying to find an excuse for his perversion marriage in divorce 1965 then when the double Covenant was made by a man a woman through sex and the other Covenant all together not the original coming up but another Covenant now I was introduced polygamy and all that after the beginning believe me was there he was both in man beasts after the beginning of fall God now secondarily sets a new nature Again by Sex God created the first of all six now this is kind of theologically this is diff this is how um we are different from almost every other denomination so if you look at what except for the Mormons most almost everyone else teaches that even in the Old Testament that David and Solomon and them were in sin when they took more than one wife but brother random teaches that that was that was perfectly the will of God to um as a type a natural type of a spiritual one uh you know God has many member bribe and marriage and divorce 1965 he said um how today the spiritual multiplication when we're back there shows then that the bride has got to come from the word by spiritual multiplication multiplication C replenishing the Earth just like it was back then Injustice 126-27 and so it is is it where the church that refuses to become pregnant in the age that we now live in to bring forth children of this age we are not Lutheran we're not with these neither are we Pentecostals we've got to be children of this age through the pregnancy of the word of God to bring forth a child of this age to see child children begin to kind of look more like him because it's full and mature or it becomes Children of the word not children of the church Children of the word and the bride will be a lovely little lady of the word unadulterated not touched by any man's organization any man-made Theory should be purely unadulitated for all worth I hope you get that out on the air she will be a cremated daughter of God that's how the bride is reproduced today by spiritual multiplication now I just want to talk briefly about completely and then jump back to in the last five minutes talk a little bit more about music because that was one of the three components of civilization artificial shelter and Lively hooded music Worldwide industry and manipulation of metals economy in 1965 the God of this evil age broke around and said watch the seed of God coming down through every age and watch where it's heading up today Christians genuine Christians are not all about scientific research and stuff you know just a minute we'll get into that but Kings did after the nature of their father the devil full of worldly knowledge of beauty and science therefore Haynes children with scientific they were educated there was a player to music music instruments a modern Elvis Presley some of this stuff like that the school board let's happen up here in the lane every Saturday night Builders of City beautifying women with personal lust of the devil giving women paint and bobbing their hair put them in the shorts and things like that it's for his own dirty lust that's pretty flat but I don't know any other way to say it the return in Jubilee 1962 you said start a Revival again Lord bring the people out of these full of things that they do play a little music and dance they call in the spirit by the rhythm of the music oh God I've seen them God Can Dance up and down the streets or in a bar room or anywhere else under the power of God when he's dancing with his spirit and shouting praise God they may seem a little different on the outside or and your church is expressing what's on the other side of it so um I've got a few quotes here about you know some people have different ideas about whether it's okay to have music in the church I think it's the Church of God that doesn't um Church of Christ that does it um and uh we'll have to answer myself what not in Matthew 26 30 I'll just uh kind of talk about it they this is where they uh we're having the Last Supper I'm just going to run through a history of Music in the church real quick they uh they had the last supper and then they sang a ham after they were finished and uh the the Jews today it's been a tradition since I guess the time of Jesus to to sing after the Last Supper The Great hollyoak which is song 136. so they think that's probably the song that they sang after uh you don't want to just turn there real quick just as an exercise to see more psalm 136. well you can see how um just the way this is written would probably fit really good into Chicago the music of the of the way the Jews do it I'll give thanks and I'm not gonna read I'll just read a little bit because it's a little long I'll give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever I'll give thanks unto the god of God for his Mercy endures forever I'll give thanks to the Lord of the Lord for his Mercy in your prayer to him who alone doeth great wonders for his Mercy endured forever so is that that's an example of the song that the early Believers with a song after after they took communion and do you still sing that today after uh the Passover so uh according to Historia the early church didn't use any instruments because they were afraid that it would it would associate too closely with Rome the Roman debauchery and how that they uh you know they played their role in Boogie Woogie music and the early Christians didn't want to have anything to do with that so uh they just they would sing you know uh either the song leader would sing a verse and then they would repeat after it or they were to buy the congregation and the different singing groups and one was saying the first person the next sing the next verse so that's how they did they did uh they just you know a lot of the early churches only had maybe 20 or 25 people in the church it's a real small group and they just sang without instruments because they wanted to avoid any appearance of evil like uh all also avoid the appearance of evil in the Middle Ages the church started uh they were very strict about even certain cores that were seemed unharmonious and blasphemous they didn't even want to have any kind of cores that sounded wrong everything had to be just right and so even through the Middle Ages they didn't the the church really didn't play instruments it was one until Martin Luther that congregational Center really became popular and Martin Luther actually said I don't even hear I don't care who preaches as long as I write the song uh so loser actually established congregational singing and uh but just here's what brother random said about he got a question that church orders are not a church order in 1963 just how many let's see instruments how many instruments are we to have in church inside the organic piano so I guess some people are concerned about little things like that like they were in the Middle Ages brother Brown it takes a profit to set a straight and tie in all the Loose Ends well it depends on if you have a String Band or whatever you had you see I don't know what you got what this means I don't understand it because the organ and the piano or property of the church and he goes on if they have are their own instruments wonderful if they don't have their own instruments and they're a member here of a band not just a person running through even plays once in a while it runs out like that it's got to be a band in the church because you got to be consecrated you got to be uh Sanctified to play not play in the church and then go out and play in some Honky Tonk or something that's I'm not reading from the quote that's me the church wouldn't buy a trumpet for a man that plays it here in tomorrow night somewhere else and somewhere else and drop in once in a while and play a little bit no sir it's got to be a band right here organized band with the leader and then the church talk to them about buying the instruments anything he said uh talking about how the spirit the Lord comes by this this presence of the Lord can be brought by a Minstrel you know someone this doesn't make the valley full of ditches in 1952 you know someone told me wrong not long ago said brother random music and the church is wrong I said it is I said do you think God changes in nature no I said then when the prophet got all skewed up and they said bring a menstrual when the menstrual began to play the hand of the Lord can perform the prophet and that music brought the power of God then it would bring the power of God now that's just exactly God still sing God and the prophet now you might not be the prophet that you can be the ministry you can be part of it anyhow to bring the power of God and that's really the role of the yes the musicians in the church was to bring the presence of the Lord before the ministry comes out and uh I'll finish it right quick if you ever have trouble getting into the spirit of prayer before you pray or anything or just uh sometimes it's hard to get let's get started praying I found it if you just put on some quiet music or start singing then it really does help bring the presence of the Lord but uh I think we just about finished yeah one um means pleasure and um scope Revival and Zillow means to hide pleasure and to hide yes thank you sister and then what I'm gonna do next is continue on with uh Genesis 5. we're going to look at a genealogy and then bounce all over to Matthew and Luke and compare the two genealogies there see what we can find her yeah a lot of times when you're driving around or doing something you're thinking and Devil's touching people in the bathtub and sing a song
