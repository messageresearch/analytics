[0:04] y'all doing all right today
[0:08] wonderful warm day outside yeah
[0:12] yeah
[0:13] turn the proverbs
[0:16] somewhere fifteen
[0:28] sister Regina's brother
[0:30] prayer request coach so let's just
[0:33] pray over that now
[0:35] about our heads
[0:37] Heavenly Father we pray Lord that
[0:39] whatever the situation is that our
[0:41] sisters come upon Lord that you would
[0:43] intervene
[0:45] Lord we know that
[0:48] the prayers of the Saints will be heard
[0:50] quicker than the angels
[0:53] so Lord now we come to you with the
[0:55] petition to go to that situation and
[0:58] take care of it
[1:00] Lord we know you're the one that can
[1:03] soothe all the anger and shoot the hurt
[1:06] you're the great healer
[1:09] you're the great Redeemer you're the
[1:10] great one that does all things for us
[1:12] and Lord we pray that you take care of
[1:14] that situation be with us today morning
[1:16] keep us safe
[1:19] keep the Wilds of Satan away from us
[1:21] Lord so that we can learn more about you
[1:22] let our thoughts be upon you father and
[1:24] nothing else
[1:25] let your words be made manifest in our
[1:27] life we ask these things in Jesus name
[1:31] amen Proverbs 15. good to be back
[1:34] thank brother Bob for taking over thank
[1:37] all these brothers for stepping in and
[1:41] um
[1:42] taking over and doing a doing a
[1:44] wonderful job amen so we're still on
[1:46] Christianity we're just going to kind of
[1:48] go through the Book of Proverbs we're
[1:49] going to kind of read some quotes
[1:51] from the prophet
[1:53] and
[1:55] our theme my theme this year is
[1:58] live me a sermon okay so Proverbs 15
[2:02] verse 32.
[2:07] he that refuses instruction now he
[2:10] wasn't that it's on going on just one
[2:12] time but refuse it over and over again
[2:16] he that refuse it the instruction
[2:19] despises his own soul
[2:23] because remember if we don't take
[2:24] correction guess what
[2:27] we're a bastard child we're not even in
[2:29] the household of God we're up we're
[2:31] we're a child that was that was formed
[2:33] from
[2:35] not the creation of word and spirit
[2:38] right okay
[2:40] you get many amens out of that it's a
[2:43] true dating him he that refusesth
[2:46] instruction despises his own soul amen
[2:49] okay but he that heareth reproof
[2:54] heareth
[2:55] every Sunday every Wednesday at home
[2:58] listen to tapes reading your Bible but
[3:00] he that heareth reproof geteth
[3:03] understanding amen the fear of the Lord
[3:06] is the instruction of wisdom
[3:09] and before honor is humility all right
[3:12] so that's a that's a big amen to that
[3:15] but now look at verse 6 of chapter 16
[3:17] and see
[3:19] how this happens
[3:22] by Mercy and Truth iniquity is purged
[3:25] because iniquity is known to do better
[3:26] and you don't do it or knowing that
[3:28] you're doing something wrong and you
[3:31] continue to do it everybody understand
[3:33] that if you know you're supposed to do
[3:34] something and you don't do it that's
[3:36] just as much iniquity as you going out
[3:37] and sinning knowing that you're sinning
[3:40] because you're withholding that's and I
[3:42] think that's our problem is
[3:44] we don't we withhold a lot of things
[3:46] that we should be speaking of or acting
[3:49] upon or or in our daily walk or our
[3:52] daily life sometimes you know them and
[3:54] the footsteps of the righteous or order
[3:56] the Lord but you've got to walk the
[3:58] footsteps right he's not gonna walk them
[4:01] for you you gotta walk in the footsteps
[4:03] the footsteps of the righteous are
[4:05] ordered of the Lord but by Mercy and
[4:07] Truth
[4:09] not a lie
[4:11] but Mercy which is Grace
[4:13] by Mercy and Truth iniquity is purged
[4:16] we've been preaching on purging all
[4:17] right
[4:19] um they really enjoyed the story of the
[4:20] catfish out and I mean the Crawfish out
[4:23] in in Kansas because it's a really good
[4:27] analogy or an example of a Christian
[4:30] Life
[4:31] where we got to purge all that old stuff
[4:33] out by Mercy and Truth iniquity is
[4:36] purged and by the fear of the Lord men
[4:38] depart from evil
[4:40] Evil's there we depart from it
[4:43] all right when a man's ways pleased the
[4:46] Lord he maketh even his enemies
[4:50] you remember what Abraham Lincoln said
[4:53] oh uh one of his cabinet members stood
[4:56] up and said
[4:58] there are enemies in the South we need
[5:00] to we need to stomp them out we need to
[5:03] to go down there there are enemies they
[5:05] don't think like we do they they're just
[5:08] they should be they should be governed
[5:10] and you know martial law and all that
[5:12] and Abraham Lincoln stands up and
[5:15] I believe the words of wisdom came from
[5:17] that man
[5:19] he said let's make them our friend
[5:23] yeah and the guy was so blown away
[5:26] he said how in the world should we make
[5:28] him a friend there are enemy there he
[5:30] said if we make them our friend
[5:32] they're no longer our enemy
[5:35] see that's the way we look at it is we
[5:37] want to cry if somebody's against us we
[5:39] want to crush them
[5:41] don't crush them
[5:44] try to project God to them right or or
[5:47] you know even in just human life just
[5:50] just trying to project
[5:52] positive to somebody that's negative you
[5:54] know but it's things that we do in in
[5:58] Abraham Lincoln I'm sure reading the
[5:59] Bible he got that from scripture
[6:03] because he was a very merciful man he
[6:05] could have really you know he could have
[6:07] really done a lot of bad things to the
[6:08] South but
[6:09] we know that that he started
[6:11] reconstruction and got down here and
[6:14] and built this thing back up but you see
[6:16] the better listen verse 8 better is a
[6:19] little with righteousness
[6:22] then great revenues without right
[6:27] better is a little with righteousness
[6:31] everybody know the song little as much
[6:33] when God is in it
[6:35] labor not for wealth
[6:37] or fame there's a crown and you can win
[6:40] it if you'll go in Jesus name there is a
[6:43] little with righteousness than great
[6:44] Revenue
[6:45] without great without right a man's
[6:48] heart devises his way
[6:51] see but I quoted this here that's why
[6:53] it's coming to but the Lord directed the
[6:55] steps
[6:56] all right a man's heart divides his way
[7:00] but the Lord directeth his stats and
[7:04] that's why I think we've
[7:06] I'm just going to be honest with you I
[7:08] think we've become as message Believers
[7:10] we throw the Bible out
[7:14] we throw the Bible out and quit reading
[7:16] it and just start being a bunch of
[7:18] quoters
[7:20] nobody understand that
[7:23] that brother Brown had to walk in a in a
[7:25] world that was different from anyone
[7:27] else we know that but was it was an
[7:30] example for us to walk in
[7:33] in our ability we none of us are going
[7:36] to be prophets like he was a prophet or
[7:39] have the gift like he had but take the
[7:42] gift away he was a good preacher
[7:45] take the gift away he was a good
[7:47] preacher he lived a good life it wasn't
[7:49] that the gift covered everything he had
[7:51] no he was uh because remember what the
[7:55] uh
[7:55] what the what was it Danny Henry got up
[7:58] and prophesied and that was the Lord
[8:00] speaking through Danny Henry they said
[8:03] it's the hard way but it's the way you
[8:05] chose
[8:06] which is my way so so brother Brown had
[8:09] to make a choice he had to make a choice
[8:11] which way to walk and he chose to as we
[8:13] were talking about last night it was
[8:15] you look at some aspects in his life and
[8:18] you think well man
[8:20] here he is on his on his uh wedding
[8:23] anniversary he's always out hunting
[8:26] thinking of me then then one time he
[8:28] does take her and he almost killed gets
[8:30] him killed by leaving them in that Shack
[8:31] you know to freeze to death and God put
[8:34] them back together but he would run in
[8:36] and grab his hunting clothes and leave
[8:37] well you think well that's not a model
[8:39] husband
[8:40] that's that was his gift that was his
[8:42] operation of one man I was telling said
[8:44] Street he said well that was one man out
[8:46] of 100 million that could act like that
[8:49] and be formed that way but you and I
[8:51] still have to look at the life that that
[8:53] man lived that's what the people in the
[8:55] Pentecostal World said they said we
[8:57] can't touch his life
[8:59] right we don't believe his Doctrine
[9:01] which is we know that's wrong but said
[9:03] we can't touch his life his life was an
[9:06] exemplary life and that's what you and I
[9:08] that thing right there that statue of
[9:10] perfect man that's an exemplary life
[9:13] Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None
[9:18] but stretches I have what in other words
[9:20] what I am what what the building I am
[9:22] because remember they have the faith of
[9:24] the fathers right they had all these
[9:26] virtues working in their life
[9:28] now that's what we've got to get to
[9:30] until we until we get to that you can
[9:32] forget adoption you can forget learning
[9:35] about the seals because you've got to
[9:36] come to a place
[9:38] sorry to the faith of the fathers where
[9:41] these virtues are working in your life
[9:43] right
[9:44] then the seals will open to you I'm sure
[9:47] you can get them in a partial form sure
[9:48] you can get them in a in a minute form
[9:50] in a small detail but brother random had
[9:53] to come to the faith of the fathers
[9:54] before God could open anything else to
[9:57] you yeah because you know what
[9:59] God's not a respecter of person
[10:02] he's not a respecter person brother
[10:04] Brown had to come to a level yes go
[10:07] where when he went across it beyond the
[10:09] curtain of time remember when he said if
[10:10] you watch he's positionally placing
[10:12] himself because he preaches adoption in
[10:15] 1960 but he goes across the curtain of
[10:17] time and he says well where's Paul or
[10:19] did Paul make it and the angel said yes
[10:21] Paul made it he said well if Paul made
[10:24] it
[10:24] I know I'll make it because I preached
[10:27] what Paul preached well Paul was at the
[10:29] faith of the fathers
[10:30] so he was positionally placing himself
[10:32] showing where he was in the scripture if
[10:35] Paul was a Son of God that would that
[10:37] had the faith of the fathers then
[10:40] brother Brown was at that in 1960 well
[10:42] then God could open then the spoken
[10:44] words Original Seed he could teach him
[10:45] Daniel 70 weeks he could start teaching
[10:48] him into the seals in 63 but it was a
[10:52] growth process we don't just
[10:53] automatically because we go to little
[10:55] George I understand everything about
[10:56] seals now you got to understand about
[10:58] Statue of perfect man first
[11:00] you got to get the new birth first
[11:02] before you start getting these virtues
[11:04] now see some of these virtues could be
[11:06] working in your life and you'd be
[11:07] walking in justification and
[11:09] sanctification that's true because
[11:12] and I appreciate our brother claude's
[11:14] about the former latter rain because in
[11:15] Joel it says you get the former latter
[11:17] rain in the same month
[11:19] well the former Reigns the teaching ring
[11:21] right you this is where you get in your
[11:23] you get in your water you're getting
[11:24] your teaching all right then you're
[11:27] going to have a ladder aim which is a
[11:28] harvest rain it's going to be a harvest
[11:30] of what was taught you it's going to be
[11:33] harvested and one day we're all going to
[11:35] be harvested off the Earth if we're born
[11:36] again
[11:37] we're either going to be buried in
[11:39] corruption and raising incorruption or
[11:40] we're going to take a body change right
[11:41] here one of the two there's no in
[11:43] between or either you're going to stay
[11:45] in the grave and you're gonna have to go
[11:46] to the white Throne judgment and give an
[11:48] account for the what you've done and I
[11:50] don't think I'd want to
[11:52] I want the merchants here I don't want
[11:55] to have to wait and try to get it over
[11:56] there all right but you see that that
[11:59] purging time and that is a purging time
[12:01] either either death is going to release
[12:04] you and Purge you or you're going to
[12:05] have to be purged while you're standing
[12:07] here or you're going to have to be
[12:08] purchasing the tribulation somewhere
[12:10] along the line we got to be purged and
[12:13] and then the foreign latter rain then
[12:15] you take the former ladder rain in the
[12:16] same month
[12:18] it's it's impossible
[12:21] to plant corn the first day of
[12:24] of April
[12:26] and harvested on the 30th of April
[12:29] in the plant world it's totally
[12:31] impossible to do it in 30 days you've
[12:33] either got a 60 or a 90 day or even 120
[12:36] days for some crops to come to maturity
[12:38] but Joel is promising us that in the end
[12:40] time that we will have a form of rain
[12:43] and a lot of rain in the same month so
[12:45] it's going to be a very short work so we
[12:47] can come to maturity a lot faster
[12:50] see it wasn't required that Luther what
[12:52] required that Wesley come to maturity as
[12:55] what God's talking about here with the
[12:57] prophet
[13:00] anybody understand
[13:02] Luther had to come to the majority of
[13:04] justification the just shall live by
[13:05] faith jury come to that maturity but
[13:07] that didn't that didn't Harvest him off
[13:10] the Earth in a body change right he had
[13:13] to go to the Grave he's waiting took his
[13:17] purging time in the ground in the grave
[13:19] buried in corruption and then he's going
[13:21] to raise when we call him out of the
[13:23] ground he's going to be raised up in
[13:25] incorruption and there he'll stand in
[13:28] the glory of what he was taught
[13:30] and what he believed for his time but
[13:33] you and I can't do that you we can't
[13:35] throw it to another age
[13:37] we don't have another age
[13:39] we don't have another time to say well
[13:40] if we don't make it
[13:43] if we don't make it that group will no
[13:46] we can't do that anymore
[13:48] we got to realize we're the only ones
[13:49] left
[13:51] and if it's a requirement like when
[13:53] Richard first come down here
[13:55] um Richard Roberts
[13:58] he didn't Daddy was preaching on statute
[14:00] of a perfect man
[14:02] hey brother Brian I mean it's actually
[14:04] perfect man book says this is a
[14:05] requirement this is required
[14:08] to have these virtues working in your
[14:09] life well Rachel said nobody ever told
[14:11] him that was a requirement he just
[14:12] thought that was something brother Brown
[14:13] priest and it was a good sermon and you
[14:15] know you understand what I'm saying but
[14:17] that's gonna be one word off right well
[14:19] there you go you got to have the whole
[14:21] thing
[14:22] one word off got us out of the garden
[14:25] that's why all these people say well we
[14:27] don't need Daniel 70 weeks and we don't
[14:29] see they start parting this out well
[14:30] what they're doing is they're taking
[14:32] their part out of The Book of Life they
[14:33] just don't know what they're talking
[14:34] about
[14:36] God if you take a part out
[14:38] the Bible says You Take A Part out so if
[14:40] we take down to 70 weeks say well that's
[14:42] just to the Jews and throw it away and
[14:43] we don't have to understand it right
[14:45] then we're taking part out of the buck
[14:48] and I thought John eat the whole book
[14:51] he didn't even pay his land on the floor
[14:53] he didn't leave crumbs laying around he
[14:55] eat the whole book right so we got to
[14:57] eat the whole book so we do have to
[14:58] understand Daniel 70 weeks we do have to
[15:00] you don't have to understand it like
[15:02] maybe
[15:03] um that does but you gotta understand it
[15:05] for what you can understand I think our
[15:08] problem is and that's where we get to
[15:09] this iniquity part because it is
[15:11] inequity to know you're supposed to know
[15:12] that
[15:14] and do that and don't do it
[15:16] that's why the Bible says in the end
[15:18] time that iniquity the iniquity will
[15:20] abound the love of many will last cold
[15:23] because
[15:24] the first seal the mystery of iniquity
[15:27] man of sin sitting in temple of God show
[15:29] himself to me as God
[15:31] message Believers that ain't born again
[15:34] that don't live a life out there that's
[15:35] worth anything
[15:37] we're going to manifest and brother
[15:39] Pinkston really like what he had not
[15:42] really read that scripture in John
[15:44] where Jesus said that um
[15:48] as John 5 I did it in a sermon where you
[15:51] had to prune off
[15:54] the branches that were not any good
[15:56] he says so you can bear more fruit not
[15:59] just bear fruit I can leave my I can
[16:01] leave my plum trees along or tree alone
[16:03] at home and it will bear some fruit but
[16:07] there's so many limbs right there's so
[16:09] many cares of the world
[16:12] kill I'm just gonna have a little bitty
[16:14] Plum on my tree but if I go out there
[16:16] and prune off that's why circumcision is
[16:19] the type of the Holy Ghost it's taking
[16:21] off the excess skin that you really
[16:23] don't need the world all right and
[16:27] then you bear more fruit
[16:30] so you take it that's why you prune a
[16:31] tree you prune a tree so you can bear
[16:33] more fruit
[16:35] you say well that don't well it's the
[16:37] Bible right it's nature it's the Bible
[16:40] Jesus said he said bear more fruit and I
[16:43] just fruit bear more fruit and that's
[16:45] the end time we've got to Bear more
[16:47] fruit than anybody else in in any other
[16:49] age
[16:50] so my my point is I look back at Peter
[16:54] James John and all those back in the
[16:55] book of Acts and if I'm not living to
[16:58] that standard
[17:00] then I'm still down at the bottom of the
[17:01] pyramid nobody understand and that makes
[17:04] me want to
[17:05] my desire is is to walk by a man and him
[17:09] him be
[17:11] um you know sitting in a wheelchair
[17:15] and just walk by and let man just look
[17:17] at you with compassion and you look at
[17:18] him and go man I can't pay for your
[17:21] hospital bill let's let's take it up to
[17:24] the 21st century because that's what
[17:26] that's what Peter was saying Peter was
[17:28] telling that man that's that was sitting
[17:30] at the at the wall there gay called
[17:32] Beautiful he looked at the man and said
[17:34] silver gold silver gold have another in
[17:35] other words I can't pay for you to get
[17:37] better
[17:38] I don't have the money to take you to a
[17:40] hospital all right man in the wheelchair
[17:43] I don't have I don't have money to take
[17:44] you to Shepherd's spinal clinic and let
[17:46] man make you better
[17:48] silver and gold how about none
[17:50] but such as I do have
[17:52] I give unto you rise up and walk you
[17:55] can't you can't buy that with money
[17:56] that's right but if they can do that
[18:00] we should be able to do that right we
[18:03] should be able to come to the place and
[18:05] we don't have to be message zombies sure
[18:07] we got lives to live we got life we got
[18:10] every day everyday works and things to
[18:12] to live like we were talking about last
[18:14] night we're talking about subjection
[18:16] if the last not under subjection to her
[18:19] husband brother Brown see she's out of
[18:20] the will of God
[18:23] sorry that's what the prophet said
[18:25] that's what the Bible said so if you go
[18:27] against that you're committing iniquity
[18:29] you commit iniquity so you know better
[18:31] that's a hideous sin and you're gonna
[18:33] have to get that fixed
[18:35] but two remember we were talking about
[18:37] the men on the other side we've got to
[18:39] give account for for you you ain't got
[18:40] to give an account for us but we got to
[18:42] give an account for you I got to give an
[18:44] account for June and what she does even
[18:45] if she does something wrong
[18:47] I have to give an account for it she and
[18:49] I have to clear that thing up
[18:51] same way with God God's our husband
[18:55] we're the wife
[18:57] and there are things that we do in life
[18:59] that God's not pleased with I don't know
[19:01] about you but there's a lot of things in
[19:04] my life I'm not even pleased with unless
[19:06] that's what God's not pleased with okay
[19:08] so take it to my point if I'm not
[19:10] pleased with it I know God's not pleased
[19:12] with it times a billion
[19:14] all right so there's things in life that
[19:16] you and your wife are not pleased with
[19:18] each other sometimes and that's okay but
[19:20] you work through it just like God he
[19:22] works through these things by Mercy and
[19:24] Truth iniquity is purged and what does
[19:28] purge mean cleanse or get that thing out
[19:30] and don't let it come back
[19:34] because the Bible said the worshiper
[19:36] once purged in Romans
[19:38] has no more conscience of sin you think
[19:41] man my conscience is full of sin that's
[19:43] where my conscience comes from is in my
[19:44] I'm sending him that conscious Realm but
[19:48] is it a sin against death or is it just
[19:51] a sin because you're falling human being
[19:55] living life
[19:57] right that's what Dad was trying to say
[19:59] last night that's what I was trying to
[20:00] say sister truly made a point good point
[20:02] but but but look at this you got these
[20:05] over here in this extreme that says
[20:07] my wife shouldn't be barefoot and
[20:09] pregnant keep all the you know wash all
[20:10] my clothes and keep all my you know
[20:12] blessed God shoes dog meat on this side
[20:15] that's true all right on this side over
[20:17] here you got the strong-willed women
[20:18] that they control everything and they
[20:20] want to control everything and their
[20:21] husband lets them control everything
[20:23] that's not good over here either but if
[20:25] you bring them both in here like this
[20:27] take a little of this and a little this
[20:28] and put it together
[20:30] brother random always said about going
[20:32] down the middle of the road right always
[20:34] take and like these life lessons that
[20:37] we're trying to learn and I hope we're
[20:39] learning to be better Christian all
[20:42] right I want to be able to live a sermon
[20:44] I've set up and tell you all day long
[20:45] how to be good
[20:48] but if you see me go you know say
[20:50] something bad or or
[20:52] excuse me or or you know not be good in
[20:55] Life or not pay my bills and stuff like
[20:57] that then what am I doing
[20:59] I'm doing a very thing that I'm telling
[21:02] you not to do I'm committing iniquity
[21:04] because I know to do better and I do it
[21:06] anyway and we do it all the time there's
[21:08] a lot of things that I don't want you to
[21:09] get discouraged but there's a lot of
[21:11] things that we do do that we know we
[21:12] shouldn't do but repent
[21:15] repent turn around that was just a
[21:19] simple sermon
[21:20] um watch night that brother Jason
[21:22] preached but it's very profound
[21:24] he said repent means if you're going in
[21:27] this direction and you're doing things
[21:28] wrong and you got things wrong and it
[21:29] keeps getting wrong and wrong and wrong
[21:31] he should turn around and go in that
[21:33] direction
[21:34] is sin right
[21:37] quit it turn around go in a clean
[21:40] Direction a different direction okay and
[21:44] we as human make mistakes a lot but
[21:46] that's very profound because you know
[21:48] what we do you know what iniquity is
[21:49] don't you we keep going in that
[21:50] direction
[21:52] insanity
[21:54] doing the same thing over again and
[21:57] expecting a different result a drunk
[22:00] does that you talk to an alcoholic an
[22:02] alcoholic says no I won't get drunk this
[22:04] time I won't get sick
[22:06] but at least barfing into porcelain
[22:09] toilet
[22:11] saying God I'll never do this again and
[22:13] then the next day guess what same thing
[22:14] happens he's expecting a different
[22:16] result
[22:17] and that's what the devil wants us to do
[22:19] in everyday life and all these things if
[22:21] we're doing things wrong
[22:26] go in that direction
[22:28] try this try this way
[22:31] what I'm saying with the Bible read The
[22:33] Book of Proverbs The Book of Proverbs is
[22:34] just wonderful for life lessons and and
[22:37] you know God didn't leave us to where we
[22:40] did not have
[22:42] a way to learn to live in this world God
[22:44] didn't it wasn't surprising that we were
[22:46] in laodicea and this is where it's going
[22:48] to happen no he equipped you to be in
[22:51] this age Lutheran Wesley I'm like that I
[22:54] don't believe Lutheran Wesley are
[22:56] probably even Paul could stand it in
[22:57] this age
[22:59] well brother random said Paul will be in
[23:01] jail before the morning that's right he
[23:03] tells the place Parks what'd he'd do but
[23:06] see we have more grace and truth now
[23:07] where we understand the age you
[23:09] understand the age that we live in we
[23:11] have cell phones when we have computers
[23:14] and but it's like brother Pinson and I
[23:16] were talking about we've got all these
[23:17] things to make information faster we've
[23:20] got all these things to we've got
[23:22] microwaves and we've got uh now we've
[23:25] got uh
[23:26] um closed washing machines that takes 15
[23:29] minutes instead of 30 and starts cutting
[23:31] all this time down but where's our time
[23:34] John Wesley's mother
[23:37] had 17 children
[23:39] she sat down for two hours every day and
[23:42] you know what she done she washed 17
[23:44] kids clothes
[23:46] probably by hand by hand yes oh no they
[23:49] wouldn't they weren't in the
[23:50] Westinghouse back in the 1500s sorry
[23:53] there was a Westinghouse but it was a
[23:55] place where they sat down and Western
[23:56] that was about it
[23:59] there was no refrigerator she had an ice
[24:01] box somewhere
[24:04] that definitely Hoover was not invented
[24:07] at the time or or
[24:09] you know vacuum clean Electrolux or
[24:11] anything that wasn't so she had to sweep
[24:13] the house 17 kids
[24:17] she had to raise 17 children two hours
[24:20] every day she sat down and taught them
[24:22] about the Lord
[24:24] they didn't want to take a while be like
[24:27] a buffet line you'd have to start at 11
[24:29] and get finished by 12.
[24:31] technology took more than two hours to
[24:33] do that laundry yeah but she held her
[24:35] sanity
[24:36] and she uh John Wesley a church age
[24:39] messenger and Charles Wesley one of the
[24:41] greatest songwriters of Christian songs
[24:43] ever known those two brothers came out
[24:46] of that
[24:47] and they were just fine so what I'm
[24:50] saying now is God knew that our time
[24:52] would be taken up but he also knew that
[24:54] we'd have time to to to study
[24:58] on the Run
[24:59] that's what I call it study on the Fly
[25:01] driving down the road even if you're
[25:04] washing clothes even if you're taking
[25:05] care of the baby you're studying there's
[25:08] things coming to your mind that how God
[25:11] does this and how you know you see God
[25:13] in this and you see God in that and go
[25:15] to the airport and he looked at all that
[25:17] heathenism going on down there and and
[25:20] you start any but you see God right but
[25:23] you see the grace of God coming to you
[25:25] and you sat there and you and you see
[25:27] those people and and you wonder how
[25:30] are they surviving in this age we're
[25:33] barely surviving knowing
[25:36] our end right knowing what's going to
[25:39] happen we're either going to take a
[25:40] Rapture are we gonna
[25:41] go to sleep
[25:43] and then come up in the resurrection but
[25:45] we've gotta we we've got a an eternal
[25:47] destination they just are there
[25:51] they're just there most of them are just
[25:53] there they do not know where they're
[25:56] going where they came from it's just a
[25:58] and to me that's Insanity they're insane
[26:02] because they're living a life and then
[26:04] everything that they've got is just
[26:05] going to be
[26:07] like job said
[26:09] a vapor
[26:11] here
[26:13] what is 70 something years do you know I
[26:15] know some of y'all are older than me but
[26:17] I just turned 53 Saturday
[26:21] 20 years from now I'll be 73. just 20
[26:24] years
[26:26] I'll be 73 years old in just 20 short
[26:30] years
[26:31] so where's time went
[26:34] where's time went time has just went
[26:37] and some of you young ones need to think
[26:39] about that I know we know that the end
[26:42] time's coming close but you still need
[26:43] to think it what if this thing does I
[26:45] would have never thought I'd been 53. I
[26:48] mean Joyce was not even talking about
[26:49] graduating because in 77 the Raptor was
[26:51] going to take place you know so we
[26:53] weren't even going to graduate high
[26:54] school
[26:55] but how did you leave that re-graduated
[26:58] and we got kids graduated and we got
[27:00] grandkids here all right dude did it
[27:02] make you leave a Christian Life knowing
[27:04] 77 no that's what I said that's why I
[27:09] no man knows that they are ours
[27:12] it didn't it just made us
[27:15] have fear yeah right instead of prepared
[27:18] hi George I mean we lived through that
[27:20] it just made us have fear
[27:23] then you know when it didn't happen we
[27:25] continued right on
[27:28] here it is
[27:29] 50 years from it almost now
[27:33] and
[27:34] we still
[27:35] the people during that time
[27:38] probably half the people that thought 77
[27:41] was gonna be it they're not even the
[27:43] message anymore
[27:45] they went off and gone into something
[27:46] else thank God that that um
[27:49] that he preserved
[27:51] some of us to make it and to be 53 years
[27:55] old but what I'm saying is about life we
[27:57] need to open up a little bit more and
[27:59] say look God
[28:00] you knew where I was going to be I know
[28:03] I'm in this
[28:05] but like Junior and I was talking about
[28:07] coming up the road a few minutes ago
[28:09] we when we were doing the Dave Ramsey
[28:11] thing we sat down and saw our finances
[28:13] well two years later after we were in
[28:15] our first class our finances have
[28:16] changed
[28:18] so we got to sit down and redo it well
[28:20] the same thing with God say God well my
[28:22] path is not the way I wanted to go we
[28:24] sat down and look and just see what see
[28:27] what God says I think we talk too much
[28:29] and don't listen
[28:30] we talked
[28:32] sometimes it's best to listen to God
[28:33] just listen and let things come to you
[28:35] right that's right I mean really just
[28:38] just in the United States and God I need
[28:40] this and you know I need this and I need
[28:41] this well he knows you need that right
[28:43] right he knows you need that just sit
[28:46] down and listen
[28:48] sit down and listen remember what we're
[28:51] talking about today listen
[28:53] I'm telling myself today but listen
[28:56] listen to what God has to say that's why
[28:58] I wanted to kind of drop back and just
[29:00] do and we may start back to the Statue
[29:02] of a perfect man because sister Regina
[29:05] made a comment about going back through
[29:07] it so we may do that but do you have
[29:09] someone do you have your quotes we're
[29:11] going to read just one
[29:13] if you don't we'll uh we're gonna read
[29:15] it anyway
[29:19] it says lend me a sermon we're going to
[29:21] read
[29:29] we're going to raid
[29:31] second page
[29:33] earn a certain sound 1955.
[29:39] I've got some here I got one
[29:50] we didn't have these I'll make some more
[29:52] copies but everybody should have them
[29:53] and eat and bring them or either just
[29:55] stack them over here and you can
[29:57] leave them here but 1955 uncertain
[30:00] sounds Jeffersonville Indiana brother
[30:01] Brown said look at the underlying part
[30:03] every man and woman that ever had it
[30:06] come back to Holy Ghost
[30:08] knew they got it no uncertainty about it
[30:11] every man that's born of the spirit of
[30:13] gods knows when he passed from death and
[30:15] their life knows the place the hour the
[30:19] minute when death changed to life when
[30:22] unbelief of the Bible changed to believe
[30:25] every word of it when haughty
[30:27] high-minded things passed
[30:31] you know what the word high-minded means
[30:33] you know the Bible says we'll be heading
[30:35] high-minded lovers of pleasure more
[30:36] high-minded means know it all that means
[30:38] you can't be taught anything that's the
[30:40] worst
[30:41] right can't help it that's the word no
[30:43] you can't help them you're right they've
[30:44] cut theirself off but but that's why I
[30:46] say open yourself up and and sometimes
[30:48] we think we got things figured out
[30:52] yeah come on I'm one of them I think why
[30:54] I got this figured out and that figured
[30:55] out and maybe that you'll find out you
[30:57] ain't got nothing figured out right how
[30:58] minded things pass to Humble Christian
[31:02] they know when death casts to life amen
[31:04] every man that had it had something
[31:06] different
[31:08] the world knew it
[31:10] you know sometimes you don't feel like a
[31:12] Christian but you know somebody walked
[31:13] up and said hey I appreciate you I
[31:15] appreciate your stand for the gospel I
[31:17] appreciate the word that you brought I
[31:18] appreciate this or appreciate the the
[31:20] testimony that you give
[31:22] well that's God telling you through
[31:24] somebody else he ain't got to say it in
[31:26] all the boys he can take you through
[31:28] somebody else
[31:30] I was telling boss this morning who told
[31:32] Moses he's going to be a deliverer
[31:36] his mother told him that read your butt
[31:39] read the prophet yeah
[31:42] said from the time that remember Moses
[31:44] was put back into mother's his own
[31:46] mother raised him inside the
[31:48] well see his own mother was in the
[31:51] Palace of the Egyptians
[31:54] the world
[31:55] but she wasn't out of the world she
[31:57] wasn't Egyptian right but she raised her
[32:01] kid in Egypt but she kept telling him
[32:03] you're the deliverer you're the one sent
[32:06] to deliver Israel You're the one that's
[32:08] gone what God was telling Moses drew his
[32:12] mother
[32:13] that he was a deliverer all right then
[32:16] God spoke to him when he got older but
[32:17] raised up a child the way it should go
[32:19] and when he's older you'll not depart
[32:22] from it the world knew it every woman
[32:24] had it had something different in the
[32:26] world knew it the world can see it your
[32:29] actions prove what you are you can say
[32:31] you got it but your actions speak so
[32:34] loud that they can't hear your voice
[32:36] your life speaks
[32:39] what you are
[32:42] somewhere we're going to manifest
[32:45] what we got inside of it we're gonna
[32:47] have to because this is manifesting time
[32:49] we're going to manifest
[32:51] one way or the other so I just want us
[32:54] to this is why I want to do maybe
[32:55] another couple of Sundays and then we'll
[32:57] start on maybe stack you a perfect man
[32:58] you know why because
[33:02] security that's correct that's what we
[33:05] were talking about in Kansas I mean in
[33:07] uh yeah clogged Sunday night they had a
[33:09] new girl there that had been just coming
[33:11] so I dropped way back and started with
[33:14] the
[33:15] corn of wheat coming up with two shoots
[33:18] then the stalk you know justification
[33:20] about the Holy Ghost but you know what
[33:22] you go out in the field you go out in
[33:24] the cornfield because the corn
[33:27] the corn when it starts looks just like
[33:29] any other weed
[33:31] see when you're Justified you look just
[33:33] like any other person you still have
[33:34] that same spirit in you but you begin
[33:36] your characteristics begin to grow
[33:39] because see you don't cut it down right
[33:40] here
[33:41] because you cut this down and the bad
[33:44] stuff down but you just wait a little
[33:46] while let it grow up a little taller it
[33:48] will have the characteristics in it and
[33:50] it will look different
[33:52] than the weed plant somewhere it will
[33:54] evolve into that corn plant which looks
[33:57] totally different from the weeds because
[33:58] most of the weeds are going to be short
[34:00] and here this big old corn stalk starts
[34:01] coming up and then guess what at the
[34:03] very end you're going to find that one
[34:05] thing's for sure if there's corn on the
[34:07] end of the stalk it was a corn plant to
[34:09] start with but if it wasn't it's not so
[34:12] let's go
