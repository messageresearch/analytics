[10:34] Joyce gave us a notes in Danny was

[10:44] said when he lived was that he's doing
[10:46] better so let's pray that the Lord will
[10:48] we'll take all of that away and and
[10:50] everything to get rid of that part of it
[10:53] okay Oh anything else that we have
[10:57] father we thank you for your grace and
[10:59] your light and your love thank you for
[11:02] you cause without you what good it would
[11:05] be even any of us Lord we praise your
[11:08] great name and your honor and glory and
[11:10] everything that we could put we would
[11:12] give to you because we know that's who
[11:15] we worship and who we want to be lifted
[11:18] up and guided by and Lord lead us
[11:21] through the times in the days we know it
[11:23] the days are getting closer and things
[11:25] are worrying away so just come and
[11:29] manifest yourself have your way be with
[11:32] Dany's our Lord his nose bleeding this
[11:34] morning and just touch him and take away
[11:36] that problem with it and all the others
[11:38] that are sick among us there's many many
[11:40] sicknesses you said you sent your word
[11:43] and healed us and delivered us from
[11:45] destruction so we believe you have your
[11:48] way now forgive our sins and lead us by
[11:51] thy grace in Jesus name now I'm putting
[11:57] in I was going to go ahead and get
[11:58] started on the point of the the new
[12:02] birth but you know we're still on it and
[12:05] trying to bring that point out but what
[12:07] we're doing good to see sister Jean
[12:09] there with us that's what I got it right
[12:11] here or written down sister Jean this is
[12:13] good to see sister Jean back what I was
[12:16] looking over all the other failed to get
[12:18] to it'd be good to see but we're trying
[12:21] to I'm trying to get a kind of a
[12:23] foundational point that it doesn't sound
[12:27] like it in what I'm bringing in things
[12:29] but once we start in to talking about
[12:33] the new birth I believe you'll see why
[12:36] this is so valuable to get us into a
[12:39] position because like we've said over
[12:42] and over you can't take salvation
[12:45] Redemption whatever in the Old Testament
[12:48] and have it one way and then come in the
[12:52] New Testament
[12:54] and have it another way you got to have
[12:57] if you want to call it anything I guess
[13:00] the best way I could say it is each one
[13:03] is a further advancement until the
[13:07] finish of that and the Lord willing next
[13:10] Sunday I'll try to bring this to an
[13:12] overall message to show you what we're
[13:17] doing and then we'll drop back and pick
[13:19] it up but just remember the point now
[13:22] you can't have an Old Testament
[13:24] salvation one way you know it's by this
[13:28] or you know I'm just saying points you
[13:32] know that it would be by because you
[13:34] would believe and do this and then get
[13:36] over the New Testament and you got to
[13:37] make it something else it's got to be
[13:40] the same it's just further advancing
[13:44] from the Old Testament to the New
[13:46] Testament it's further advancement see
[13:49] the New Testament starts exactly kameena
[13:52] and this is where I put it and the way I
[13:55] believe it the New Testament salvation
[13:56] will start exactly where we've left off
[13:59] as the Old Testament of what it is and
[14:04] what's it based upon believing believing
[14:08] all right so then we put the New
[14:10] Testament to start right on that and
[14:12] we'll go right on that okay all right so
[14:14] that should get us a start I want you to
[14:17] keep that in your mind all right Jonah 2
[14:21] and 9 but I will sacrifice unto thee
[14:25] with the voice of Thanksgiving I will
[14:28] play that that that that I have vowed
[14:31] salvation is of the Lord and the Lord
[14:33] spoken to the fish and it vomited out
[14:36] Jonah upon the dry upon the land trial
[14:40] and all right now we're going to go into
[14:43] the Book of Ruth to pick up the kinsman
[14:46] part because this is very vital to tie
[14:51] the old with the new all right because
[14:54] it's got to be that he's got to be the
[14:56] Keystone right Jesus Christ is the
[15:00] Keystone from the old to the new he fits
[15:03] in without that you wouldn't have any
[15:05] hopes whatsoever
[15:07] save reading let's just go to about two
[15:09] root three and eight and we'll just read
[15:13] a few verses to get our thought and it
[15:16] came to pass at midnight that the man
[15:18] was afraid and turned himself behold a
[15:20] woman lay at his feet and he said who
[15:22] art thou and she answered I am Ruth Don
[15:25] handmade spread therefore thy skirt over
[15:28] thine handmaid for thou art a near
[15:30] kinsman and he said blessed be thou of
[15:34] the Lord my daughter for thou has showed
[15:37] more kindness in the latter end than at
[15:40] the beginning in as much as now
[15:42] followers not young men whether poor or
[15:46] rich and now my daughter fear not I will
[15:50] do to the all that thou requires
[15:53] requires for all of the city of my
[15:56] people doesn't know that thou art a
[15:58] virtuous woman and now it is true that I
[16:01] am thy near kinsman howbeit there is one
[16:06] near then I carry this not and it shall
[16:12] be in the morning that if he will
[16:14] perform unto thee the part of a kinsman
[16:16] well let him do the kinsman's part but
[16:21] if he will not do the part of a kinsman
[16:23] to thee then will I do the part of a
[16:26] kinsman to thee as the Lord liveth lie
[16:29] down until the morning you may be seated
[16:32] for that is blessing to the reading of
[16:35] the word now you know that we'd be
[16:38] dealing then with the kinsman our
[16:42] kinsman redeemer our kin folks all right
[16:48] so if there's going to be a salvation
[16:51] that would come into being you know and
[16:55] bringing it into light
[16:57] we need to wedge a message in to think
[17:01] about the kinsman redeemer or the
[17:05] kinsman is what I put on it because
[17:07] that's just a a point because it's not
[17:11] just the kinsman redeemer he does the
[17:13] redeeming part but there's other things
[17:15] that transpire
[17:17] you know and we get all of the things in
[17:20] line
[17:20] and trying to go and I was thinking
[17:23] while I was studying on this a little
[17:25] about the the situation that took place
[17:28] with Ruth and Boaz do you realize that
[17:31] by the point of Boaz taking Ruth to be
[17:37] his wife that the first child from Ruth
[17:42] and Boaz would go to what is it named a
[17:45] la mejora or something Milan or it would
[17:49] go to that line or lineage right because
[17:54] you know that's the son of Naomi and
[17:57] that they had to have the lineage in the
[17:59] right order so the first child that
[18:02] would be born from from Ruth and Boaz
[18:05] would go to Naomi and Naomi takes it to
[18:10] her bosom you know and in all in it and
[18:12] really it's a child from because of the
[18:15] law in the kinsman part it's a child now
[18:20] listen it's a child from a lot mayhaw
[18:25] everybody pronounce his name
[18:27] all right and Ruth you so no boy - see
[18:31] just listen just don't get too smart out
[18:35] with it just listen to the point of what
[18:37] I'm getting at because see that way you
[18:39] you did get in it and you'll find out
[18:42] one of these days why the Bible says
[18:44] this endless genealogies they'll trap
[18:47] you up and I get so tickled at people
[18:50] trying to follow lineages and following
[18:53] it down from in this coming down and how
[18:56] they come down to Judah and Tamar and
[18:59] they do this and they bring it down you
[19:01] know and and they have the things and
[19:05] brother Branham called Judah and Tamar
[19:06] adultery and then he says that progestin
[19:10] a seed can't come from adultery we don't
[19:12] listen to him and his wording we just
[19:16] make it to what we want to make it and a
[19:18] beautiful picture you know we'll look at
[19:20] this of how this woman done this and
[19:22] that's done and see you jump right over
[19:24] from from Judah and Tamar and you go to
[19:28] automatically to Ruth and Boaz
[19:32] No then Ruth's being a Gentile coming
[19:36] into the lineage and not only coming in
[19:40] it doesn't go to the second son from
[19:43] Ruth and Boaz to cure the lineage it
[19:47] falls the Obed OB IDI it falls over and
[19:52] Obed is the son born from Ruth and Boaz
[19:57] but the lineage falls back don't go to
[20:03] booth and boys I know it comes down to
[20:06] the irony I can read I can go to Matthew
[20:08] and give you genealogy some 14 here to
[20:10] 14 here to 14 year and it all is in
[20:12] there but it's just the point the point
[20:15] of what I'm trying to get you to see is
[20:16] that that overhead comes from Ruth and
[20:23] Boaz but the name right has had to fall
[20:26] back the ruse first husband and do it so
[20:32] you can't follow the lineages
[20:34] you get all fouled up in lineages and in
[20:39] genealogies and all kind of things you
[20:42] know we just get all to get in there no
[20:44] this goes to this and this goes to that
[20:45] and then you got Rahab the harlot she
[20:48] fits in and here it comes down through
[20:51] to the axon huh
[20:54] this is if we just think and listen and
[20:59] try to be sensible about the Bible and
[21:03] read it the way it's written in things
[21:05] we wouldn't be all massively confused of
[21:08] trying to say oh look at this look at
[21:11] this look at this and look at it oh this
[21:13] is great here look how this fits here
[21:15] and it don't fit you know yeah we got it
[21:20] all built up we didn't okay just put
[21:24] that dough brother Dale to say well we
[21:28] should at least read the word and know
[21:31] what it says okay now what was that we
[21:35] were talking about in the life service
[21:37] okay Jesus say it now watch we're gonna
[21:41] wedge this party into her we're gonna
[21:44] speak of this kinsman alright and
[21:46] talking about him and Jesus says you
[21:49] must be born again or you cannot see
[21:54] [Music]
[21:56] understand or you cannot enter
[22:00] you know uses both names see understand
[22:03] enter the kingdom of God
[22:07] alright see then why must we be born
[22:10] again you remember how we were bringing
[22:14] this out and our thoughts was on it
[22:16] but run said on the spoken word his
[22:18] original seed said we're born in sin
[22:20] from Eve's sin born in sin from Eve sin
[22:27] and as we're doing that then there's
[22:30] nothing in any of us no lineages that
[22:33] could ever be anything since it's like
[22:37] to see everybody lays that part of will
[22:38] look at Judah and Tamar and from dark
[22:41] came David from David came Jesus and you
[22:46] don't even realize that's a natural
[22:48] lineage to be carried over to her it's
[22:52] not the spiritual lineage
[22:55] that was the point of once a Timon ago
[22:57] see it's not the spiritual lineage the
[23:01] spiritual lineage comes through from
[23:03] Abraham Isaac and C then it would jump
[23:07] away over but it's carrying on what is
[23:10] said in the Bible of the Book of Ruth is
[23:13] a book wedged in to show you the
[23:16] genealogies and things to cover you know
[23:22] the point of understanding what
[23:25] Redemption it our lineage isn't thought
[23:28] so used to following that line alright
[23:30] but see when because Jesus was not born
[23:33] from the earth right he was born from
[23:40] above and the original translation there
[23:44] in John 3 you know where he says you
[23:46] must be born again it says you must be
[23:48] born from above all right brother
[23:52] branham verifies it we gave you quotes
[23:54] and different things on it to understand
[23:57] but what does it mean to be born from
[23:59] above there's no physical point or
[24:08] thought there's no genealogy there's no
[24:14] seeds or thoughts like that because he
[24:20] said you must be born from above he said
[24:25] in other words you must be born from
[24:27] where I was born from and I'm not of
[24:32] this world
[24:32] I was not of this world and he covers in
[24:36] the scriptures and we went through it
[24:38] we'll do it a little more this evening
[24:39] where he's saying look if my kingdom was
[24:42] of this world my just my followers would
[24:45] fight and he said it's not that away see
[24:50] you do away when you come from the Old
[24:52] Testament that was the point of what I'm
[24:55] driving it see we want to try to make
[24:57] these lineages run out and who was it
[24:59] and was it speaking was it Aaron
[25:04] Wednesday
[25:06] anyhow talking about do you think them
[25:08] Jews brethren said it's you know so do
[25:10] you think them Jews would tell them tell
[25:13] the the way you know that they have lied
[25:15] and give his life away and done this and
[25:18] that now you think the most honest Jews
[25:20] would write that in there no they
[25:23] wouldn't have done it it was a Holy
[25:25] Spirit made in put that in there they
[25:29] had to write it according to what he
[25:30] said because it's not the natural
[25:34] genetic genealogies or whatever you want
[25:37] to call them it's come from Abraham to
[25:40] Isaac and fault as a spiritual because
[25:46] Abraham is the father of the faith
[25:50] spiritual seeds see we're supposed to
[25:54] get away from that natural genealogy if
[25:58] we're going to come to a New Testament
[26:01] then we're supposed to be coming to a
[26:04] new position to not be covered in
[26:09] genealogies or thoughts but to be in the
[26:12] spiritual genealogies and under thy seed
[26:16] which was Christ all right see then
[26:20] Christ never come caught if you run the
[26:23] natural lineage of Christ even with
[26:26] putting in Ruth and Boaz and in all of
[26:30] these things that you got in and Rahab
[26:33] the harlot and all of that mixture that
[26:35] you've got and Judah and Tamar and all
[26:38] of those things that you got all wound
[26:40] up and you try to run your lineage and
[26:44] your natural lineage goes to Joseph the
[26:51] one that married Mary it doesn't go to
[26:54] Mary
[26:55] there's no lineage for the women so if
[26:58] you're gonna take your natural lineage
[27:00] to look where you go you didn't read
[27:03] that and there's no Baptist Methodist
[27:05] Presbyterian before you come into
[27:07] message but I didn't have to explain
[27:09] them things the way he explained it was
[27:12] great because it sure was a whole lot
[27:14] better than what we had it would get the
[27:17] point
[27:17] the Bible has written it
[27:20] was told that away and see you can't
[27:23] follow those natural genetic lineages
[27:27] they won't work you got to come to a
[27:31] spiritual lineage to start a New
[27:34] Testament and seeing that even the
[27:37] physical lineage won't line up in the
[27:39] Old Testament how you gonna run all of
[27:42] them things was run here through this
[27:45] and obedience well I got this thing out
[27:47] there
[27:47] oh they just got these great doctrines
[27:49] in it they will get to that in a minute
[27:51] or this evening a little bit about it
[27:55] but what about it see why you find then
[28:00] you must be born again because Jesus's
[28:06] first message was you must be born from
[28:09] above in other words you've got to be
[28:12] born from where I came from a natural
[28:18] birth of of dude that won't do anything
[28:22] to go back a time and and go back into
[28:26] your mom and come back out of that
[28:27] wouldn't do you no good all right so
[28:32] then get away from all of those things
[28:34] or we'll be like Nicodemus we'll be
[28:39] saying you know what's this and what's
[28:41] that we don't understand that you can't
[28:45] run those things you've got to come to
[28:48] the basis of the truth see you must be
[28:51] born again you must be born from above
[28:57] all right you've got to be born because
[29:00] she was born wrong to start with then we
[29:03] had that one but now here's the one I
[29:05] was quoting it and I really missed
[29:06] quoted it I'll show you in a second you
[29:10] know I had it right but I mean it's just
[29:11] amount of numbers go to number two and
[29:15] let's get just out and get it out of the
[29:17] way and then we'll move on all right now
[29:21] watch what brother Branham says on you
[29:23] must be born again and I've asked you to
[29:26] read the message or listen you must be
[29:29] born again
[29:31] statue of perfect man key to the door
[29:35] why we're against organized religion
[29:42] statue of perfect man blasphemous names
[29:45] and watch you said well brother branham
[29:50] come to blaspheme his name's he come to
[29:52] statue of perfect man and he said it
[29:54] like this when he come to a statute
[29:56] permit you remember what he said in
[29:57] there he said I just got this the other
[29:59] day on something lies don't preach all
[30:02] well you know what he just got that the
[30:04] other day on something he's gonna preach
[30:06] off in other words you know what he
[30:08] didn't have that two days before he got
[30:10] the scriptures that lined up something
[30:12] for him now the other message I want you
[30:16] to go back to is a little message called
[30:18] Intervale or the title has been changed
[30:24] to why as my people talked about but
[30:30] it's called Intervale 19 and 56 and
[30:38] you'll see that in 1956 he was preaching
[30:42] a greater depth of understanding about
[30:46] the new birth then mankind could open
[30:52] understand because he says there's only
[30:55] two or three or one he set up really
[30:57] only heard one man who believed it the
[30:59] way I believe it yeah we know all about
[31:03] it you know all right so get this
[31:07] message you must be born again
[31:08] alright watch what it says we find out
[31:11] that there is so many different meanings
[31:13] that people put to it it's all about
[31:15] what is the new Burke you know the
[31:17] morning and experience now when you're
[31:19] studying the message if you'll put
[31:21] born-again experience and the new birth
[31:24] into one category it'll help you a whole
[31:27] lot because you're gonna find brother
[31:30] around them many many times mentioning
[31:33] you must be born again and you know I
[31:36] mean you know the new birth and they're
[31:38] being born again
[31:39] it ain't two separate times we're going
[31:42] the Lord willing we're gonna get into
[31:44] some
[31:44] it may be a little eye-opening to us
[31:49] about the new birth maybe you'll see
[31:51] then why the Prophet said there's not
[31:54] too many new birth now watch him this is
[32:01] what he's talking about you must be born
[32:03] again right we find out that there is so
[32:07] many different meanings that people put
[32:08] to it
[32:09] nearly all churches say that you must be
[32:11] born again
[32:13] what but each one has their their
[32:18] different interpretations to that what
[32:22] it means to be born again I might go to
[32:26] the Methodist Church this morning they
[32:27] say we believe that you must be born
[32:30] again how do you interpret it I go to
[32:34] the Baptist Church and we believe you
[32:36] must be born again
[32:37] how do you interpret it I would go to
[32:40] each search and we'd find if we went to
[32:44] all the nine I said eleven hundred the
[32:46] other day on it I knew it was nine
[32:49] hundred but that was his mouth
[32:52] outrunning brain if we want to all the
[32:57] went to all the nine hundred different
[32:59] denominations of churches there'd be
[33:02] nine hundred different interpretation at
[33:10] one point what you must be born again
[33:14] the one message that Jesus the first one
[33:17] he pries you'd have nine hundred so
[33:22] seeing that there is so many different
[33:24] interpretations and yet a Bible doctrine
[33:28] there must be and is a truth somewhere
[33:34] that you take the 969 or whatever
[33:38] different we talked about it nine
[33:41] hundred different in denominations and
[33:43] what about you put about two thousand in
[33:46] the message because as he said each
[33:50] church system the Methodist have their
[33:52] way of saying it the Baptist's how their
[33:55] way of saying it you know you go to one
[33:57] and you'd say well
[33:58] well all you got to do is believe that's
[34:00] badness you know what Methodists used to
[34:02] be say you know this is where a long
[34:05] time ago it's not now now you just go do
[34:08] what you want to go you don't you don't
[34:10] do nothing you know but it used to be
[34:12] the Methodists they shouted you know and
[34:16] you've heard run around and say that
[34:18] they even poured water on them he said
[34:22] or they had come through speaking in
[34:23] tongue but he poured water on their
[34:26] Methodists to stop them from shouting
[34:28] another word all right let's see what
[34:32] about one doctrine 902 use it
[34:38] incorrectly of that form of what he's
[34:40] saying it different ways of one doctrine
[34:46] then you turn around and come in this
[34:48] message and you got the two souls the
[34:50] two lords the peruses and the son of
[34:53] man's and the river Jordans you got all
[34:55] that and if you don't believe it like
[34:57] they believe it then you're not born
[35:00] again and see each one of them has got
[35:07] thoughts and ideas
[35:09] each of the nine hundred churches as he
[35:14] was doing them has their way of
[35:17] expressing it but they have truth the
[35:22] people this message how truth you know
[35:27] doctrines are not built on there
[35:30] shouldn't be but we know now they've
[35:31] getting built on this about anything but
[35:33] they shouldn't be built on flim-flam
[35:35] ideas they should have a little truth to
[35:37] it what
[35:39] and what about 900 in different ways of
[35:45] saying you must be born again don't you
[35:50] think it's going to take us quite a
[35:51] while to get into that because we're
[35:58] going to have to state some things that
[36:00] is going to sound contrary to your
[36:06] previous beliefs to be able to express
[36:13] the things that are said about it so I
[36:16] would be considerate of the next few
[36:20] services and try to attend or at least
[36:23] listen to the message yeah all right
[36:28] so now what is it see why must you be
[36:31] born again because you're born wrong we
[36:34] covered that in the last message all
[36:35] right now then what does it mean you
[36:39] must be born again then it comes down to
[36:47] what we're talking about the message
[36:50] oncoming storm but we live here he said
[36:58] you know like you heard him say his wife
[37:00] would say it's you know well well we're
[37:02] not of this world she'd say well what
[37:03] are we you know are we not American
[37:05] doing i he said no all the limbs got a
[37:08] nice analogy away in a nature about him
[37:12] he says no words we live here but we're
[37:17] born from above the Holy Spirit of God
[37:22] comes upon us born from above the spirit
[37:32] of Christians you know as Christians
[37:35] that's borne by the Spirit of God is
[37:38] born from above their spirit is of
[37:42] another Kingdom and I'm so glad that
[37:49] you must be born from above when you say
[37:53] born again you got to be born from above
[37:57] wherever he came from is where we've got
[38:01] to go now I relate that like brother
[38:05] branham senators you know he said a
[38:07] preacher will rock standing up and
[38:08] preaching ladies on the backside of the
[38:10] desert and meets God personally hunting
[38:12] about well then
[38:13] ain't no preachers we'd have to ever one
[38:16] go to Israel and we got to find
[38:18] somewhere on the backside of the desert
[38:20] where Moses was that you know that's
[38:22] impossible okay that's what I'm what I'm
[38:25] saying it's just impossible so it's
[38:28] impossible to follow the thought or a
[38:29] line of mankind on that you must be born
[38:32] again he said we're living in America
[38:35] off of the message called the kinsman
[38:36] redeemer he said that's true that's the
[38:40] body part said but the soul that
[38:46] conducts us our character is born above
[38:57] born from above we live from above
[39:01] because we're born from above all
[39:04] Christians come from above they were not
[39:13] of this world he said he's not of this
[39:15] world
[39:16] right jesus said I'm not from below I'm
[39:22] from above if I was from below my
[39:25] subjects would fight for me but my
[39:27] kingdom is of above and so is every man
[39:32] that's born to the kingdom of God
[39:34] he's from above born from above to be
[39:44] born again is to be born from above well
[39:48] I don't understand what you're getting
[39:49] in whatever brought him here has to
[39:55] bring you here wherever he came from you
[40:00] must come from the
[40:01] well know how cuz we were not talking
[40:04] about her body now he just said they
[40:07] were Americans he said that the body
[40:09] part ain't gonna do it it's whether or
[40:13] not you and I are born again if we were
[40:15] born again we're born from above because
[40:19] the Nicodemus couldn't understand it he
[40:22] thought it was something natural here on
[40:24] earth and Jesus was trying to explain to
[40:27] him that that was not what it was when
[40:30] eternal life comes in and the message
[40:34] while I'm against organized religion
[40:37] when eternal life comes in there born
[40:41] from above and the works from God
[40:44] manifests himself because of the same
[40:46] life that was in him it cannot do
[40:49] anything else eternal life can only come
[40:54] from above now don't get lost in
[40:59] thoughts of trying to figure out what do
[41:01] you mean above I mean one simple plain
[41:05] language he came from another world not
[41:16] a Superman ideology as of this days but
[41:19] they do get two points and try to
[41:21] present them he came from above he never
[41:29] came from this earth he came down from
[41:36] above to walk on this earth and none of
[41:42] this was his
[41:44] he created it and everything but he
[41:47] wound up having to borrow one to be born
[41:49] from had to borrow a grave to be buried
[41:52] in him he was so much from above
[41:58] until he said my kingdom is from above
[42:05] as I've always said about you know the
[42:11] pilot the role there was when it was
[42:13] questioning him you know he evidently
[42:17] laid down so you know we just read
[42:20] thoughts of what his dark but evidently
[42:23] Jesus laid down so much of a thought
[42:25] before Pilate until Pilate said to them
[42:28] I'm not afraid of this guy
[42:31] I'd like to have this guy on my team I'm
[42:36] not afraid of him because he's not
[42:39] talking about any kind of a kingdom that
[42:43] would be of this world he speaks of some
[42:46] kind of a kingdom some other way or some
[42:48] something and said wouldn't it be great
[42:50] for a kingdom to come some word take
[42:53] over all of this and and run this you
[42:56] know you understand what I'm getting in
[43:00] Pilate said I'm not afraid of him he
[43:03] turned him he'll send him back he said I
[43:09] find no fault I found no reason he said
[43:14] are you a king he said to this end was I
[43:16] born or he turned back to him and said
[43:19] is that what you're saying did you get
[43:22] that from yourself where'd you get that
[43:24] from somebody else that you're thinking
[43:26] about me being a king
[43:29] and he just said I don't have nothing to
[43:32] do with my cuz it was so much from above
[43:41] you know where our problem is we live a
[43:44] split condition we live in an earthly
[43:48] body that is from this dimension time
[43:51] and kingdoms and we have a spiritual new
[43:56] birth that takes place on the inward man
[44:00] and that's supposed to come from above
[44:03] you know the Holy Ghost did come down
[44:06] right don't mean just the point but it
[44:10] did come down you know and Jesus was
[44:13] constantly talking about my father in
[44:16] heaven right
[44:20] he was constantly praying and doing
[44:23] those things but do you get what I'm
[44:25] talking about he says I can see God oh
[44:33] let's get the point he says now is my
[44:38] kingdom not from hence in other words my
[44:43] kingdom is not from here all right are
[44:46] we solved on that so then whatever the
[44:49] new birth is it's going to have to be
[44:52] from above right it's going to have to
[44:58] be something supernatural
[45:01] it's going to have to be something
[45:03] spiritual and not physical so then our
[45:06] physical genealogies wouldn't work me
[45:12] like they say in the message you know if
[45:14] you happen to be born from Adam and and
[45:16] Eve said you could be saved but said if
[45:19] you're born from the Beast and Eve you
[45:21] can't be saved because that surface seed
[45:25] well I've always preached it and always
[45:29] said forget it
[45:31] everyone of us was born serpent seed I
[45:33] don't care whether you like it or not
[45:36] you tell me where you come from did you
[45:39] come from above are you a Superman that
[45:42] dropped to earth no now we've got to get
[45:47] this natural part running right all
[45:50] right now listen he said he came from
[45:55] above I like that because of the
[46:01] relationship that I can read through the
[46:04] prophets message and to realize that God
[46:11] came from heaven whatever you call it
[46:16] another dimension the thought to this
[46:19] earth to redeem us
[46:27] you had to come that away now what and
[46:30] then listen he never sent a son he came
[46:39] himself right so then it was not a
[46:44] father sending the son he never sent an
[46:53] angel I got plenty of laying here in
[46:55] front of he would never sent a prophet
[46:58] or an angel or anything like that he
[47:02] came himself because he came from above
[47:12] see God came himself and was made a
[47:17] human God himself now didn't send a son
[47:23] didn't send a second person or a third
[47:25] person well there's no such thing he
[47:29] came himself to pay the price because
[47:32] he's the only one worthy remember the
[47:35] kinsman had to be worthy visit I mean
[47:38] financially to pay the price he had to
[47:42] be kinfolks to be able to have any
[47:45] transaction to go with it all right so
[47:49] you remember what happened in the Book
[47:51] of Ruth there was one closer kin the
[47:56] Book of Ruth tells you that now the
[47:58] brother rod said it was the devil now if
[48:02] you want to claim anything of being born
[48:04] from any just remember you was
[48:07] born between the Beast and Eve no I
[48:10] wouldn't I've got this genealogy I can
[48:12] write all the way back and I got all
[48:13] this in genies oh I can I can prove
[48:15] where I came from you can
[48:23] you need to get locked up with all of
[48:25] these guys that climbing all of these
[48:28] things and you know of evolution and try
[48:32] to evolve yourself down some way we
[48:36] don't fool of that go that's garbage all
[48:39] right but now think about it this
[48:43] kinsman had to come from another
[48:48] dimension another world another
[48:51] situation he came to earth to become
[48:57] kinfolks to you and I which meant that
[49:01] by doing that that he would have to come
[49:05] into human flesh so then the Prophet
[49:12] would explain in body he's a man a human
[49:18] being he said in Soul he's Almighty God
[49:23] he said in spirit that's Almighty God
[49:26] dwelling in that that's why the Bible
[49:28] said God was in Christ reconciling the
[49:31] world
[49:33] you don't listen when brother Adam is
[49:36] saying things if you'd listened he's
[49:39] reading scriptures but we thank him as
[49:42] being something that well you know and
[49:45] blood around him we'll say he said look
[49:49] said at one time said the son was
[49:54] speaking remember that one he said and
[49:58] another time the father was speaking
[50:02] well that sounds like two people but
[50:08] we've got to rule that out because it
[50:09] can't be that
[50:11] and what would rule it out would be the
[50:14] fact of God coming here and not sending
[50:18] another person
[50:21] me he didn't send the Sun he was the Sun
[50:30] see one of these days we're going to
[50:32] realize realization of the Godhead and
[50:37] begin to understand some things that the
[50:42] Prophet taught us in the 40s in things
[50:45] in the fifties and the sixties
[50:49] but yet we don't know what truth is
[50:54] do you realize brother Brennan said in
[50:57] body he was a man he said that was the
[51:02] Son of God
[51:06] now we're not Trinitarian that wasn't
[51:08] God the Son no it's the son of God
[51:11] there's no such thing the Bible is God
[51:14] the Son see it's the Son of God but why
[51:18] would Jesus stand and say you ask
[51:21] anything in my name your profit would be
[51:28] praying along and he said Lord now we're
[51:31] taught to do this he's talking to the
[51:35] Lord he said we're taught to do this
[51:38] he said we're taught to ask in Jesus
[51:41] name and said we ask it in the name of
[51:46] your son do we think we're releve 'td
[51:52] and what you want to call it because we
[51:55] can jump up and claim the name of God as
[51:57] Jesus
[51:58] but just remember Jesus was a man the
[52:06] body part was a man laying in that
[52:11] cradle was Almighty God Jehovah crying
[52:17] in the cradle the body a man a kinsman
[52:26] he had to do that to be able to pay the
[52:29] price he couldn't pay the price at
[52:30] spirit room come we didn't send spirit
[52:35] room we fell in flash we did spirit room
[52:38] yeah that's okay go ahead remember the
[52:40] main thing was the flesh was what took
[52:42] it into the reality
[52:47] are you following me if we all
[52:51] understood to Godhead I like that quote
[52:53] from run around in the church age book
[52:54] he said something went out and he said
[52:56] it would be great if everybody
[52:57] understood the oneness with the Godhead
[53:03] do we understand the oneness of the
[53:06] Godhead that that human flesh is my
[53:15] brother that was the only way he could
[53:21] become kinfolks to me he had to do that
[53:28] because that would be the only way and
[53:29] look we already had one closer kin right
[53:35] the Book of Ruth which was the devil in
[53:39] other words we've born kinfolks
[53:41] to the devil no I think no no no we
[53:44] wasn't see him see those where you'd go
[53:46] ahead see you're born kinfolks
[53:54] to the devil there was one had a right
[53:58] to purchase us according to the Book of
[54:01] Ruth and according to the Prophet
[54:04] explaining it and that was the devil the
[54:10] natural story I've always tried to tell
[54:12] you you looked at the natural story you
[54:14] know the story what it was as I said a
[54:16] moment ago about the the child going
[54:18] back to the name he that was where boys
[54:21] were smart read your Bible I just
[54:27] reading it a minute ago when Moyes went
[54:30] out to the Kinsmen that was closer kin
[54:33] he said by the ride of Naomi
[54:39] and he says I will read your Bible
[54:45] I will buy boys said well Ruth now I
[54:54] told you that you got one closer kin and
[54:59] if he buys you it and pays for you then
[55:01] you gonna go with him
[55:05] in other words he's telling her this day
[55:08] you're gonna go with one of the other
[55:10] you going with him are you going with me
[55:13] because he'll pay the price then you're
[55:17] going with him
[55:19] and she knew that that was the rules of
[55:21] regulation if she paid if that kinslin
[55:24] paid Naomi for Naomi he got everything
[55:27] and looking if you read you buy he
[55:29] gotten he never got just Naomi he got
[55:34] the two sons names property Ricci Bible
[55:38] sitting there I just got to reading it
[55:41] Luka Ruth he didn't just get the one a
[55:45] ruse got both of them both of them
[55:51] descenders didn't have to bring up
[55:53] children - the second one the other one
[55:56] but he had to bring up children to
[55:59] Ruth's husband to keep the story running
[56:03] correct
[56:04] all right now listen so what did he do
[56:08] he says okay kinsman you got to write
[56:13] your the nura ken do you realize what
[56:17] that means being uric in you realize you
[56:20] and I were Newark into the devil and we
[56:22] was God the Old Globe we don't want to
[56:25] add to it
[56:26] we don't want them things no I was
[56:30] brother Dave you don't under what's this
[56:32] about these evidences that we have in
[56:34] the doctrines of the mess I was born of
[56:37] this seed in me I don't need nothing I'd
[56:39] boil eternal life
[56:42] that's what you preach the message well
[56:46] if you was you don't need no
[56:47] kinsman-redeemer at all you didn't need
[56:49] boys
[56:53] no but see Boaz was smart he says okay
[56:58] kinsman the day you by Naomi now listen
[57:04] if Ruth had have been married to a
[57:07] closer kin into the family that kinsman
[57:12] would have took it if she'd have been
[57:14] born down the Jewish line we'll call it
[57:16] on the Israeli line of people you know
[57:19] what she wasn't she was born to Gentiles
[57:27] you know you understand what I'm getting
[57:30] at the two husbands were Gentiles
[57:36] now so he says the day you do said
[57:41] you're gonna have to bring him children
[57:43] took all his my headline I ready my lawn
[57:47] because he's the mister husband of Ruth
[57:52] in that near kinsman boy he said to her
[57:55] he said I won't do that I ain't bringing
[57:58] no Gentile into my lineage I'm giving
[58:02] you natural story so he turns to boys
[58:05] and he said boys is he you reading the
[58:07] right I'm not gonna do it
[58:11] the boys were smart he tricked him into
[58:15] letting him have what he wanted all
[58:19] right what are you with me now he never
[58:23] sent another person he came his cell to
[58:27] be kinfolks to you and me he become our
[58:31] kinsman the Bible coach that he's not
[58:33] ashamed to call his brother you know
[58:37] fleshly speaking he's our father our
[58:41] mother
[58:42] our healer or all away he's my brother
[58:47] because he was born in human flesh that
[58:51] was created for the purpose of making
[58:54] the kinsman Satan could never come that
[59:03] way he tried and couldn't get to ride
[59:05] but Jesus Christ came straight from
[59:08] glory to earth to be my brother and your
[59:11] brother to pay the price that we could
[59:18] be redeemed not sending to another he
[59:20] came himself he came himself of course
[59:27] it's on tape that door we do but
[59:29] remembers on paragraph 176 of the
[59:33] kinsman redeemer he said first you
[59:35] belong to him talking about the devil he
[59:39] send the message there he's talking
[59:40] about the devil we had another kinsman
[59:42] so when you and I were born naturally we
[59:49] were born naturally right physically
[59:53] human beings now Satan perverted that
[59:58] line to come down because there was no
[1:00:02] way he could get in and and bring his
[1:00:03] own gene or germ or seed or whatever
[1:00:06] right he didn't have anything for that
[1:00:08] so he mixed up the spiritual part and
[1:00:10] made it falling into the line of the
[1:00:12] flesh and when it fell into the line of
[1:00:14] flesh everything that comes from that
[1:00:16] wound
[1:00:20] wound up to be polluted
[1:00:23] they don't make no difference whether it
[1:00:25] was cane or able it was polluted we gave
[1:00:31] you scriptures are the other day about
[1:00:33] it right I'm going through he's just
[1:00:34] born of a woman all right see then we
[1:00:39] came into human flesh Satan could not
[1:00:43] come and create that flesh right
[1:00:47] couldn't do that but he perverted the
[1:00:50] flesh that we would be brought into he
[1:00:56] came our kin folks I'd like to think
[1:01:04] about this body belonging to God but
[1:01:06] he's gonna have to redeem it for too
[1:01:08] long to him right now okay she didn't
[1:01:16] what are we we were born the property of
[1:01:21] the devil oh that's just like an old
[1:01:24] Mayflower
[1:01:25] I guess the tickled at that I guess our
[1:01:28] life gets the tickle trying to explain
[1:01:30] something and it comes up like that you
[1:01:32] know and they say my family come over on
[1:01:34] the Mayflower mine did too there's
[1:01:39] probably crooks and stowaways I'm
[1:01:41] wearing a boat how'd yours get here some
[1:01:44] I don't know although my lineage mm-hmm
[1:01:49] what good is lineage
[1:01:52] what we need is a kinsman brother
[1:01:56] Brennan said on the message my
[1:01:57] commission he's our kinsman redeemer
[1:01:59] isn't that right that God was manifest
[1:02:02] in flesh to take our place to be a
[1:02:06] kinsman to us as explained in the Book
[1:02:10] of Ruth and Exodus and he become
[1:02:13] kinfolks to us
[1:02:17] to be able to end to pay the price so
[1:02:25] then the price now listen I'm DOMA
[1:02:29] everything that Adam lost you know that
[1:02:34] quote but it's the manifestation of the
[1:02:36] spirit everything that Adam lost you
[1:02:44] find in the Book of Ruth that Jesus
[1:02:49] Christ come to return her restore and
[1:02:54] Adam lost the right to come forth and
[1:02:59] bring that flesh into a place of
[1:03:03] eternity so then it fell for God to have
[1:03:08] to come God himself now not another one
[1:03:11] God would have to come to human flesh
[1:03:15] that's what I love about it when you you
[1:03:18] talk to people and you just see they
[1:03:20] can't understand the Godhead you say
[1:03:23] during that baby they'll run said your
[1:03:27] God with no teeth he said you're over
[1:03:31] crying in a cradle I just don't see how
[1:03:35] that could be God
[1:03:42] and see he was the very soul of Almighty
[1:03:45] God in that human being the very spirit
[1:03:49] of Almighty God you and I how did we
[1:03:54] come we come a body a spirit insight was
[1:03:59] still mine right
[1:04:00] are you with me we come body and spirit
[1:04:03] in Satan's domain Jesus had to walk
[1:04:06] among us but that spirit that was within
[1:04:09] him was not just a man's spirit it was
[1:04:14] the spirit of Almighty God heed now
[1:04:17] listen he didn't have a man's spirit in
[1:04:19] the Spirit of God that spirit was the
[1:04:23] spirit of Almighty God
[1:04:24] that's what's your prophet says and I
[1:04:26] ain't gonna argue it when just quote
[1:04:28] what he said he said in soul he was God
[1:04:30] he said in spirit he was God he said
[1:04:33] spirit he was he said that way he knew
[1:04:34] everything now we see we only got the
[1:04:40] body I mean we got the body and the
[1:04:43] spirit into the realms of Satan you know
[1:04:47] by the new birth now listen I'm coming
[1:04:50] up a new birthing back this true by the
[1:04:52] new birth he gives your soul eternal
[1:04:55] life your soul is just as eternal as his
[1:04:59] soul but your body your spirits not so
[1:05:04] we had to have then a kinsman
[1:05:08] to pay the price to get the body here to
[1:05:11] bring it in the right way Cody could
[1:05:14] have never been done so he had to be
[1:05:16] made my kinsman's kinsman they find to
[1:05:22] be kinsman every night I had kinsman
[1:05:24] redeemer nice racing at us and all these
[1:05:26] Asians my kinsman because he's not just
[1:05:30] my Redeemer
[1:05:31] he's my all in the hall and he's my god
[1:05:35] standing in human flesh he's everything
[1:05:39] he's Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:05:41] he's Lord Jesus Christ he's Rose of
[1:05:44] Sharon Linda devout he's everything and
[1:05:46] his name is Jesus
[1:05:50] the little baby was Almighty God but see
[1:05:55] we're so smart it was that who was
[1:05:56] running the world while he was in the
[1:05:59] crate oh I straighten him out on that
[1:06:02] and I got I got you straightened out all
[1:06:06] right but listen God Himself is off the
[1:06:14] message the manifestation of the Spirit
[1:06:16] God who is in spirit unveiled himself in
[1:06:22] a body of flesh which was his son Christ
[1:06:27] Jesus and God was in Christ reconciling
[1:06:30] the world to himself and became kinfolks
[1:06:33] to human beings to suffer the penalty
[1:06:35] that he had put on the human himself and
[1:06:38] he became kinfolks
[1:06:40] and a redeemer not just speak 10 folks
[1:06:48] or whatever so you want to make it to
[1:06:50] one point when I take the whole package
[1:06:54] if he paid the price for everything why
[1:06:57] can't we just believe for everything you
[1:07:01] know why are we gonna fall short see
[1:07:03] that's like the people of the message
[1:07:04] and you know the denominations teaching
[1:07:07] the people this message I'm gonna get a
[1:07:08] new body
[1:07:11] they just don't believe in the blood of
[1:07:13] Jesus Christ being enough to redeem this
[1:07:15] one when the Prophet said you drop that
[1:07:18] you pick something else up that's not
[1:07:22] redemption he said you bring back the
[1:07:24] same thing and to solve the problem with
[1:07:27] the people of the message you know wrote
[1:07:29] around taught it that way but to solve
[1:07:30] it will one time when Jesus raised he
[1:07:34] raised with nail prints in his hands in
[1:07:39] his feet and holding his side letters
[1:07:46] don't understand that man well what's
[1:07:51] wrong with it he became my kinsman to
[1:07:57] take my place
[1:07:58] - worth it it would not just be to try
[1:08:02] now listen this is unreal careful for a
[1:08:05] second you know yourself better run said
[1:08:08] Adam in the garden God breathed in his
[1:08:11] nostrils bless him it's night eternal
[1:08:13] life made him an eternal person with God
[1:08:17] so what if he'd just done that to you
[1:08:19] and I on left her side away what if it's
[1:08:25] just that he gives you the new birth and
[1:08:27] leaves you in that situation you know
[1:08:31] you'd have to have a new body you're not
[1:08:33] how something but you can't do that
[1:08:39] his body was redeemed not it it was
[1:08:44] sinful it had a beginning anything has a
[1:08:49] beginning has to be redeemed his body
[1:08:52] was made eternal but he made a way for
[1:08:58] you and I to reach eternal life in body
[1:09:00] spirit and soul
[1:09:06] if he could call his brother
[1:09:15] so that he could redeem the fallen race
[1:09:23] that he could redeem the Fallen race and
[1:09:27] watch your profit in his stories had
[1:09:29] always least told it he said he had to
[1:09:31] be worthy he said in other words he had
[1:09:35] to be physically you know enough money
[1:09:39] to pay the prize and said not only would
[1:09:45] it be that away to where he could pay
[1:09:47] the price he said that has to be but
[1:09:51] city has to be nearer kin so how could
[1:09:57] he become European the god of glory can
[1:10:03] pay the streets of gold we talk all
[1:10:05] right
[1:10:13] but it had to become kinfolks
[1:10:21] to pay the price that's what he's I love
[1:10:26] this one that's why he's our advocate
[1:10:29] you know what he knows what it is
[1:10:33] there's no sin as it robs mr. scripture
[1:10:36] that's come upon man that he didn't go
[1:10:38] through now see I know you're smart out
[1:10:41] I go we're gonna go ahead and blow your
[1:10:42] brains the women to say he never had a
[1:10:45] baby no but he went through a whole lot
[1:10:50] worse than having any baby and they beat
[1:10:54] him with that cat of nine tails if then
[1:10:56] there's a whole lot more than you women
[1:10:59] having a baby I'm I'm not against that
[1:11:01] part I'm just to the point of work that
[1:11:04] I'm sorry
[1:11:04] I think we're so silly but he never had
[1:11:09] a baby he don't know what it was like to
[1:11:13] have a baby no he knows a whole lot work
[1:11:18] I wouldn't want to be a woman in swap
[1:11:22] places with it
[1:11:24] it's just honest I just try to make it
[1:11:27] the plain and then when I make it plain
[1:11:29] that comes out too plain see because you
[1:11:32] relate to it and but it makes you look
[1:11:34] good you know or something some ego
[1:11:37] situation but listen can you realize
[1:11:41] this is my whole point of the message
[1:11:43] can you realize God became human to pay
[1:11:52] my price he was he had he could he could
[1:12:00] paid your price with gold thinning ten
[1:12:03] foot high or way around the whole
[1:12:05] universe because he was worthy than away
[1:12:13] but he had to be kinfolks that didn't
[1:12:18] cost him a whole lot of money that
[1:12:20] didn't cost him streets of gold that
[1:12:23] didn't cost him all kind of high-priced
[1:12:26] things it cost him his life because
[1:12:31] there was no way to pay the price just
[1:12:36] because now in the Book of Ruth the boys
[1:12:38] remember don't die because that's just
[1:12:41] part of the story that's just a natural
[1:12:44] but in this hour Boaz has to die he had
[1:12:50] to pay the price he had to die human
[1:12:54] death to be able to redeem you and me
[1:13:08] but Rena said there's one thing about it
[1:13:10] he said the new birth he said it makes
[1:13:13] you a child of God he said but then you
[1:13:16] turn around and you just differ I'm
[1:13:19] paraphrasing a quote he says you differ
[1:13:22] with the word he says you prove you're
[1:13:24] not his child then that something
[1:13:35] we're gonna find out and maybe a little
[1:13:37] bit in predestination of why God chose
[1:13:40] you
[1:13:47] no I chose him no you didn't choose him
[1:13:49] he chose you
[1:13:51] then you accepted him but he followed me
[1:13:58] now he is our kinsman because he came to
[1:14:03] be able to pay the price now paying that
[1:14:09] price was not a pile of gold this price
[1:14:17] required death he had to die to release
[1:14:25] his life that could come back in us that
[1:14:29] would start the plan of redemption
[1:14:31] I said start because you get the Holy
[1:14:35] Ghost like there penticoff it's just to
[1:14:37] start
[1:14:45] to start to plan a Redemption Almighty
[1:14:48] God had to come from glory and come to
[1:14:53] earth to pay the price and all the time
[1:14:56] he knew what he was here for he knew
[1:15:03] what he came for you think about I think
[1:15:08] it this way maybe it's not but this is
[1:15:11] where I think did you think about in the
[1:15:13] garden he's he prayed so that his sweat
[1:15:16] became as drops of blood scientifically
[1:15:19] they say that there is a position in
[1:15:22] pain that you could literally come to
[1:15:24] work now I've read this no that's all
[1:15:27] right I don't care that it would come to
[1:15:30] where the elements of your body would
[1:15:32] break down that you would be so much
[1:15:34] into pain and agony that it could
[1:15:37] actually happen and you realize what he
[1:15:41] was doing you realize I turned the
[1:15:44] garden that he knew what about all the
[1:15:50] Scriptures had come to his mind while he
[1:15:52] was in the garden
[1:16:00] come on
[1:16:02] he knew those scriptures and he knew how
[1:16:08] that they'd beat him how they do him
[1:16:11] because he knew the Scriptures and what
[1:16:15] it said and he knew that it was not for
[1:16:22] himself that he was doing it he knew it
[1:16:29] was for you and me
[1:16:34] he knew the scriptures were telling him
[1:16:37] how he'd be beaten how he'd be done how
[1:16:38] he'd been put on how they do everything
[1:16:41] how they would put the crime with orange
[1:16:43] how they do everything you say well some
[1:16:45] of that wasn't even written well don't
[1:16:46] worry about it he knew it before it was
[1:16:48] written just get the point
[1:16:55] no wonder his sweat became his drops of
[1:16:58] blood when he could realize and the
[1:17:02] worst thing that I can think about I've
[1:17:06] preached this to you before but you
[1:17:07] think that were sin you could think
[1:17:09] about the worst thing that I can think
[1:17:13] about that would be the burden upon him
[1:17:15] was to know that ever one of them
[1:17:21] disciples and every one of you and me
[1:17:29] was gonna leave him in the garden if I'd
[1:17:32] have been Narada you'd have been there
[1:17:35] you'd have been running like crazy
[1:17:36] because I would have to don't think that
[1:17:40] away no I would have I would have stood
[1:17:43] out sorry oh so did Peter oh yeah
[1:17:48] so did Peter Peter grab the sword he's
[1:17:50] doing pretty good he was getting in the
[1:17:52] fight
[1:17:52] he said come on boy what he cooks in
[1:17:55] here it wasn't Jesus's words to him it
[1:18:02] was Jesus's words made him realize hey
[1:18:06] this guy ain't gon fight I better run
[1:18:12] with the rest of right I better run with
[1:18:17] the rest of them killed I sure can't
[1:18:19] hook the whole crowd right what about it
[1:18:25] yes but if I'd have been back dar where
[1:18:30] are you now because where you are now
[1:18:34] where you and me are now is exactly
[1:18:38] where we would have been back there
[1:18:43] right no I would have stood up for him
[1:18:51] well what do you stand up for now the
[1:18:58] church we talk about us being in the end
[1:19:00] of time in the world coming to an end
[1:19:01] and in the rapture being close at hand
[1:19:04] and yet we just slowly falling backwards
[1:19:07] we're not as dedicated as we used to be
[1:19:10] we're not as sincere as we used to be I
[1:19:13] said we
[1:19:15] dump it all of us right
[1:19:26] what about it
[1:19:28] come on musicians what about it is he
[1:19:32] your kinsman by being your kinsman would
[1:19:37] require him to be Father Son and Holy
[1:19:40] Ghost Lord Jesus Christ Alpha Omega
[1:19:42] being and all of the great everything
[1:19:44] you could think of ever points you could
[1:19:48] think of to be a kinsman as I said then
[1:19:57] a lot of it is not dealing maybe with
[1:19:58] redeeming so that's reason I chose to
[1:20:01] put it kinsmen instead of kinsman
[1:20:03] redeemer because we're supposed to be
[1:20:09] Christ living in this earth not as a
[1:20:12] point to have to be doing this or have
[1:20:14] to be doing that I've said this and I
[1:20:19] mean it seriously brother branham never
[1:20:22] come now listen and you listen right
[1:20:27] because you make me say something I
[1:20:29] don't say that's your business
[1:20:31] everybody never come to teach us about
[1:20:33] women's dress and hiring clothes you
[1:20:35] Pentecostals are already on that line
[1:20:37] now us Baptists until the fifties
[1:20:44] what about you Presbyterians you others
[1:20:47] until I'm along in the 50s you didn't
[1:20:50] are go to church looking wrong right did
[1:20:55] right around have to come through to
[1:20:57] tell us is wrong to cut you higher from
[1:21:00] women No
[1:21:02] now come on we'll pick it right and make
[1:21:05] it to the point the / churches had got
[1:21:07] so far away from it - they didn't even
[1:21:09] know that's what it said so he had to
[1:21:11] bring it come on get right and what I'm
[1:21:12] talking about
[1:21:13] he brought it but he didn't have to
[1:21:17] bring them time you don't have to be a
[1:21:25] Christian to know that a lot of things
[1:21:27] are wrong let's tan you don't have to be
[1:21:36] claiming a Christian to know it's wrong
[1:21:38] to commit adultery you don't have to do
[1:21:42] that you don't even have to be a good
[1:21:47] badness to realize that you might really
[1:21:52] realize consequences that goes with
[1:21:55] things they see we want to put it all
[1:21:58] into one point you know and try to well
[1:22:01] bread around come straighten out all
[1:22:02] this stuff there's a lot he didn't have
[1:22:04] to straight now we didn't miss Church in
[1:22:13] the Baptist Church we didn't go on
[1:22:18] vacation that it was not related to
[1:22:20] church about you and not the way you
[1:22:26] lived well you know the Prophet didn't
[1:22:29] tell us we had to do that did he
[1:22:32] no we done it because it was the thing
[1:22:34] it was life at the time it was what we
[1:22:37] knew and thought of as being
[1:22:38] Christianity right lean brother Brown
[1:22:45] had to come tell you is wrong to drag
[1:22:47] around the curse and wrong to steal and
[1:22:54] like I said or you won't roll your point
[1:22:58] he done those things because a lot of
[1:23:00] people never been talked to true they
[1:23:03] didn't know it was wrong so he told it
[1:23:06] like it was listening to a message other
[1:23:09] night and then he estimates what was the
[1:23:10] name of it I forgot but if you ever one
[1:23:13] of these days I'll get around to run it
[1:23:14] back listen but in that message I
[1:23:17] listened to him standing there and I
[1:23:22] could see that he truly was a prophet
[1:23:30] not because that he was bringing the
[1:23:33] word in a certain ways or whatever ain't
[1:23:35] talking about that and that message I'm
[1:23:36] talking about
[1:23:37] he was coming right down the line from
[1:23:39] the White House to every house in the
[1:23:41] country and telling how far we'd got
[1:23:44] away from God and I said to her listen I
[1:23:48] thought Elijah did come because he went
[1:23:54] from the White House right back to our
[1:23:56] houses and tell him where we went wrong
[1:23:59] he didn't necessarily preach Christian
[1:24:02] you know quit doing this and quit doing
[1:24:04] that and it's wrong to do this under
[1:24:05] there he was just telling the natural it
[1:24:08] was just like he had went to the White
[1:24:10] House and was representing Jesus Christ
[1:24:14] as a prophet and not trying to preach no
[1:24:18] religious thing other than the
[1:24:20] condemnation that God had sent and I
[1:24:27] just sat down to listen the Lord he was
[1:24:31] a prophet
[1:24:36] but he had it as it he had no grace in
[1:24:41] that message it was just straight why do
