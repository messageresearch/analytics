[0:00] foreign
[0:27] was talking about now he didn't actually
[0:29] use the word meekness but he was talking
[0:31] about the
[0:32] the number one problem in America and I
[0:36] think this is really the number Pro the
[0:38] number one problem we have is not being
[0:41] able to um
[0:43] when you see it propping up in the
[0:45] message today is
[0:46] people beginning to say well even though
[0:49] I have a quote for this even though
[0:51] brother Randall said this I'm not so
[0:53] sure I can put my faith in this yeah
[0:54] well meekness is really when you when
[0:58] you don't take your own intellectual
[1:00] concept when you see God's word being
[1:03] made manifested in profit
[1:05] um right it's kind of like um
[1:09] crawling up under the wings of that
[1:11] great mother eagle and saying we can
[1:14] take we can take a rest and a soul us
[1:16] and
[1:17] um comfort in staying within the
[1:20] confines of God's word and not trying to
[1:23] build up something with our own internet
[1:25] that improve something but just uh
[1:30] let's get into it I don't know so let's
[1:33] look at Matthew 5 5.
[1:35] I'll just read that to get started
[1:37] blessed are the meat
[1:39] for these children here at their
[1:41] and the reason they're going to inherit
[1:43] the earth is because they can take God
[1:44] at his word
[1:46] and rest on nothing else but God's word
[1:48] right
[1:51] now
[1:56] so I had a few um
[1:59] just to get started a few
[2:02] quotes that I found that were real good
[2:04] but from 1958 Jesus Christ the same
[2:06] yesterday today and forever and I'll
[2:08] just read the whole quote the order of
[2:10] our meeting
[2:11] and America is hard for the people to
[2:14] see it the American people
[2:17] my greatest meetings have been held in
[2:19] Switzerland Germany
[2:21] and Africa and India where as many as
[2:24] 500 000 people attend at one time
[2:29] to go through this Sunday School
[2:36] like 30 000 at a time receiving Christ
[2:39] and 25
[2:41] 000 healed at one for one inch that
[2:43] Carlos and brushes and things
[2:45] taken from one one prayer over the
[2:48] people
[2:48] and here's our problem
[2:50] and this I'm going to start talking
[2:52] about why you know you hear people
[2:54] accuse you of being intellectual why
[2:56] that is so bad be accused of being an
[2:58] election right and what Paul said about
[3:00] it we people in America are intellectual
[3:03] we won't be entertained
[3:05] and it's all intellectual we're well fed
[3:08] we're well executed too well
[3:11] and then we get to a place until we know
[3:14] more than God does oh yes the more
[3:16] simpler he can be the more you'll
[3:19] understand God and that's I think that's
[3:23] maybe a lot of
[3:25] the trouble today is we get to a place
[3:27] where we think well
[3:29] I don't I I I really what what he's
[3:33] saying I know so much now that I don't
[3:36] need the message anymore I don't need
[3:39] the quotes that you you uh bring I I got
[3:43] I got it all I've I've got a better way
[3:45] but you will never have a better way
[3:48] than than uh what God has brought
[3:51] through his profit if you get outside of
[3:53] that
[3:54] your own Dangerous Ground all right
[3:58] in conference since 1960 he said and
[4:01] when we find out that Moses and his
[4:04] great schooling and his intellectual
[4:06] learning smart intelligent
[4:08] he was so shrew until he could teach
[4:10] teachers
[4:12] and not trying to support ignorance but
[4:15] I think that when we get that way we're
[4:17] in the most dangerous states we can get
[4:19] into when we get so smart
[4:22] that we know more than everybody else
[4:25] that's half what's the matter with the
[4:27] world today that's what's the matter
[4:29] with the Nations today each one is
[4:31] trying to get smarter than the other
[4:34] that's not what we're trying to do God
[4:37] gives us the Revelation that should make
[4:39] us small or not try to put the other
[4:41] person down and say um
[4:45] I'm uh I'm bigger or better
[4:52] and show us the father he'll suffice us
[4:55] he said now we're going to see if we can
[4:56] see God how many would like to see God
[4:58] let's see your hands
[5:00] I know it's juvenile life and we're
[5:03] supposed to be children
[5:05] when we get to know a whole lot then we
[5:07] don't know nothing that we ought to know
[5:09] the Bible said we always never want to
[5:11] get a great intellectual feeling that
[5:13] we're above somebody or no more than
[5:16] somebody else just be calm and simple
[5:19] people try to explain God and go flow
[5:22] over the top of it you know that can
[5:25] apply to a lot of things in life like I
[5:27] think that's I kind of approach that way
[5:29] of work I'm I'm a team lead at work over
[5:32] seven people and I've been a software
[5:34] developer for 15 years but when somebody
[5:36] has just started out comes and says well
[5:39] I found this Nifty little tool on the
[5:40] Internet or something even though I've
[5:43] got Mastery over the subject right well
[5:46] maybe they found something that I've
[5:48] never seen before tonight
[5:51] and uh
[5:54] I think
[5:55] this that the whole topic of meekness
[5:57] pretty much sums that up we uh
[6:01] and that that scripture down that First
[6:04] Corinthians 8 2 and if any man think
[6:06] that he knoweth anything he knoweth
[6:08] nothing yet as he ought to know now
[6:11] take that too far and you say because in
[6:13] this
[6:14] you know um
[6:19] we uh
[6:21] in this last day when the words being
[6:23] made manifest we're supposed to reach a
[6:25] point where we have confidence in what
[6:27] we believe and we know where we stand
[6:29] we uh Eagles are supposed to understand
[6:31] we're supposed to know what we're
[6:33] talking about that's that's not what I'm
[6:35] getting at I'm um we're supposed to uh
[6:38] but the really the topic of this is
[6:42] um standing on the word of God when you
[6:44] get when you get to where you think you
[6:46] know so much that you don't need the
[6:48] prophet's message anymore that's um
[6:54] so let's let's go to this little story
[6:57] in Acts 27.
[6:59] thank you
[7:02] to find out the prophet Paul
[7:06] made a statement
[7:09] it was disregard and see how it got him
[7:11] into some trouble
[7:22] oh the journey to roll when I put this
[7:24] little math up here just to kind of give
[7:27] us something to look at
[7:29] Acts chapter 27.
[7:32] let's kind of read this whole this whole
[7:35] uh chapter
[7:38] starting at verse one
[7:41] and when it was determined that we
[7:43] should sail into Italy
[7:45] they delivered Paul and certain other
[7:47] prisoners under one named Julius
[7:49] a centurion of Augustus band
[7:54] and entering into a ship of agromedium
[7:57] we launched meaning to sell by the coast
[8:01] of Asia
[8:02] one aristarchist a Macedonia of
[8:05] thessalonica being with us
[8:08] but Paul has loved together with all the
[8:11] prisoners
[8:12] and the policy requested to go to Rome
[8:14] they're taken into Rome
[8:16] and you know I doubt any of the other
[8:18] prisoners actually asked to be taken to
[8:20] Rome they're taking that to being taken
[8:22] to Rome not on their own accord right
[8:24] but Paul wanted to be a witness so he
[8:27] testified
[8:29] and the next day we touched aside on the
[8:32] sidearm as
[8:36] right there so they started out right
[8:39] there and they moved up the coast and
[8:41] they come to sidon
[8:43] you know
[8:44] and Julius can courteously and treated
[8:46] Paul and gave him Liberty to go into his
[8:48] friends
[8:49] to refresh himself
[8:52] and when we we had a lot from this we
[8:55] sailed under Cyprus because the winds
[8:58] were contrary
[9:00] so they moved on Up Under Cypress
[9:03] and the whole way the winds were
[9:06] contrary so they had to sail Against The
[9:07] Wind by turning this the way you do that
[9:10] by turning the sail all the way One
[9:12] Direction the road of the opposite way
[9:14] and then you keep flipping back and
[9:15] forth so the whole wader are going back
[9:18] and forth all the way up Against the
[9:19] Wind
[9:22] and when we had sailed Over the Sea of
[9:24] silicia and pamphilia we came to Myra
[9:27] City of La Sierra
[9:30] they come up to Myra
[9:32] you know another thing this
[9:34] Myra is in history is a place where this
[9:36] man named Nicholas Amara gave two golden
[9:38] eggs two uh dollars without a dollar
[9:42] these two ladies that didn't have a
[9:44] dollar and that's where the Saint
[9:45] Nicholas came from Santa Claus that
[9:48] little city right there where Paul
[9:50] stopped in
[9:51] and uh
[9:53] verse six in there the Centurion found
[9:56] the ship of Alexandria
[9:58] sailing into Italy and he put us there
[10:00] in
[10:02] and when we have sailed slowly many days
[10:05] and scared to come over against tinnitus
[10:08] the wind not suffering us we sailed on
[10:12] the creek
[10:13] over against ceremony
[10:19] so the wind is still not available
[10:39] you can see how far they cut I'm trying
[10:41] to journey to roll
[10:46] now when much time was spent and when
[10:49] sailing was now dangerous because the
[10:51] past was now already passed the fastest
[10:53] the day of atonement Paul admonish them
[10:56] now the fast was now already passed
[10:59] that's important
[11:08] again
[11:14] that that point of the fastest already
[11:16] passed is important because from
[11:18] November to January they stopped travel
[11:19] so now they're at Lucia and they're all
[11:22] worried because the winter is coming and
[11:25] they need to find a place to stop over
[11:27] the winter until January so they can
[11:29] continue on their voice their own
[11:32] now when much time was spent when
[11:35] sailing was now dangerous because the
[11:37] fastest now already passed Paul and
[11:39] moniston instead of them servers I
[11:42] perceive that this Voyage will be even
[11:43] much hurt and much damage not only are
[11:46] the leading and not only of the
[11:49] leading the ship but also of our lives
[11:52] and how much debate has been said about
[11:54] whether this what Paul is saying here is
[11:57] by the leading of the Holy Spirit
[11:59] now
[12:00] this is a everybody's uh
[12:03] they're at Lucia they're uh it's a
[12:06] everybody's like this is not a good
[12:07] place for us to stay over the winter but
[12:09] Paul's saying you need to stop right
[12:11] here and uh
[12:14] when you when you're reading through the
[12:17] message if you just consider what Paul
[12:19] was saying Paul is presenting a warning
[12:22] to them that you need to obey obey what
[12:27] uh God is giving me
[12:30] and um
[12:33] instead of looking
[12:35] to the prophet of God right they looked
[12:38] let's see what they look to
[12:40] verse 11 nevertheless this interior and
[12:43] believe the master
[12:44] and the owner of this year more than
[12:47] those things
[12:48] which were spoken by Paul now where are
[12:51] they trying to get to they had to put
[12:53] them all the way from over here they had
[12:55] sailed Against the Wind all the way over
[12:56] here to Myra through roads all the way
[12:59] down to some money to Lucia and they
[13:01] were only trying to get from there to
[13:04] there that far after they had come this
[13:07] whole journey also and just stop a
[13:09] little bit this will be a fine enough
[13:11] place
[13:12] but instead of accepting what the
[13:14] prophet of God said what had been laid
[13:16] out before them they
[13:19] decided to accept their own what their
[13:22] own reasonings their own intellectual we
[13:25] know better than what this man is saying
[13:27] we know better than what he's telling us
[13:30] because we've gotten more experience
[13:32] we've got more education the owner of
[13:34] the ship that we've uh
[13:37] the uh the captain of the ship has been
[13:39] through sailing school you know it can
[13:41] read the Stars he's been doing this
[13:43] before
[13:46] but uh Paul
[13:48] knew
[13:50] what was going on right
[13:54] in verse 12 because that even was not
[13:57] commodious to win
[13:59] the more part advised to depart fence
[14:02] also
[14:03] then by any means they might attain in
[14:06] Phoenix and they're the winner which is
[14:08] a Haven of creep and lies toward the
[14:11] southwest and Northwest
[14:13] and when the south wind blew Softly
[14:15] supposing that they had obtained their
[14:17] purpose
[14:18] and that just how the devil does a lot
[14:21] of times it will blow softly and make
[14:23] you think I'm going down the right way
[14:26] but as soon as you get started then
[14:28] everything just begins to fall apart do
[14:31] you think as soon as you get off God's
[14:33] word uh there's no way to put the puzzle
[14:37] pieces together right remember that
[14:40] story about brother random told about
[14:41] the the picture of the cow and the field
[14:44] and everything you got to put the puzzle
[14:45] pieces together but if if you throw away
[14:48] what the God's Prophet said
[14:50] then uh
[14:52] there's no way
[14:54] what are you standing on I know this is
[14:57] kind of simple and we should all
[14:59] I know it is but um
[15:04] and when the South William blue softly
[15:07] supposing that they had obtained their
[15:08] purpose loosing fence they sell close by
[15:12] creep and that will happen
[15:14] not long after there arose against it a
[15:17] tempestuous wind
[15:19] called Europa dog
[15:21] and when the ship was caught and not to
[15:23] not bear up into the wind he never drive
[15:25] and running under a certain Island which
[15:27] is called claw that we had much work
[15:29] to come by the boat
[15:31] which when they had taken up they used
[15:33] tails undergirding the ship and fearing
[15:37] unless they should fall into the
[15:38] quicksand straight sail and silver were
[15:40] driven
[15:41] so now they had Paula giving them the
[15:43] word of the Lord to stay there and just
[15:46] wait through the winter and now they
[15:48] left and everything's beginning to fall
[15:49] apart and they're trying to hold the
[15:51] together to hold their
[15:52] together they got bigger ropes and
[15:54] undergirded it to keep the wood together
[15:55] because
[15:56] there's a storm so bad if you reach
[15:59] further on down to the Stars this and
[16:01] the sun were were completely hidden and
[16:05] they tried by their man-made theology
[16:08] their man-made things that they had
[16:09] conjured up in their own mind trying to
[16:12] piece together God's word by their
[16:13] intellect they try to hold things
[16:15] together that'll never work it just
[16:18] won't work and we being exceedingly
[16:21] tossed with the templates the next day
[16:22] you need light in the ship
[16:24] yeah
[16:26] and the third day we cast out with our
[16:29] own hands the tackling of The Shield boy
[16:32] that's something we can all take to
[16:34] heart and get rid of everything in our
[16:36] lives it's uh that's holding us down
[16:40] and when neither Sun nor stars and many
[16:42] days appeared and no spot small tip of
[16:45] sleigh on us all hope that we should be
[16:47] saved was then taken away but after long
[16:51] after this Paul stood forth in the midst
[16:53] of them and said sirs ye should have
[16:56] hearken under me
[16:57] and not have a loose from creep and to
[16:59] have gained this harm and loss and now I
[17:02] just want you to be a good cheer for
[17:04] there shall be no loss of any man's life
[17:06] among you but other Shield so there
[17:08] stood by me this night the angel of God
[17:10] whose I am and whom I serve
[17:13] now Paul on the first days had an angel
[17:16] with it
[17:17] and he had he had the scriptures written
[17:19] down to keep us in line so we could have
[17:22] something to compare against and I was
[17:24] reading what uh Irene is
[17:26] not like Irene is because he was as far
[17:28] as I know the only churches that
[17:30] messenger that was raised in the message
[17:32] he was born and raised in the message
[17:34] that's kind of interesting about him but
[17:37] he was he wrote about the uh
[17:40] what was called the Catholic Church
[17:42] calls Apostolic succession and they kind
[17:44] of Twisted that and turned it into well
[17:46] we'll vote on who's going to be the next
[17:49] leader of the church that's not how God
[17:51] works right he takes somebody and proves
[17:54] them by how they honor the word whether
[17:57] they'll stay with the word and that's
[17:59] how God chooses man chooses by political
[18:02] means who's going to meet our uh our our
[18:05] objectives and our little hidden
[18:07] backyard dealings and things but
[18:10] Paul irenius wrote about how we know
[18:13] that what we preach what I preach is
[18:16] true because you can trace it all the
[18:17] way back to what Paul preached Paul had
[18:20] an angel and Paul had his scriptures
[18:23] written down so that we could compare
[18:25] that's the same way today and this day
[18:27] brother Branham had an angel with him
[18:29] and he had all of his scriptures and all
[18:30] of the messages so that we can go back
[18:33] and compare and prove that what we
[18:35] believe Compares back with what he
[18:37] taught and that's what that's what our
[18:40] confidence is based on that everything
[18:42] what I believe I can compare back with
[18:44] what he said if I can't find it in his
[18:46] word and compare it back with the
[18:48] scripture right then what do I have to
[18:50] stand on that's what I'm trusting in
[18:52] that's right and if you if you uh if you
[18:56] can find what he taught and lay it
[18:59] before you and then say I don't believe
[19:00] it then that's like what they're doing
[19:03] with their taking these roots and trying
[19:04] to hold them together something by by
[19:07] their own intellect see how bad and
[19:10] collection we can call somebody an
[19:11] intellectual that's what that's where
[19:12] you're calling sometimes they're not
[19:14] being led by the Holy Spirit they're
[19:16] being led by something that is by their
[19:19] own mental conception conception right
[19:22] and then uh
[19:26] now I mentioned this last time second
[19:28] Corinthians chapter 10. if you want to
[19:30] find out what meekness is this is the
[19:32] chapter to read
[19:34] verse one through five now I call myself
[19:37] beseech you by the meekness and
[19:39] gentleness of Christ
[19:41] who in presence and base among you
[19:43] but being absent and bold with you
[19:47] but I beseech you
[19:49] that I may not be bold when I'm in
[19:51] prison with that confidence where would
[19:52] I think to be born again soon
[19:54] which think of us as if we walked
[19:57] according to the flesh
[19:59] you all realize what he's saying there
[20:00] there's some of y'all that think that I
[20:03] have an intellectual yeah that walk
[20:06] according to the flesh
[20:07] and he said I'm not walking according to
[20:09] the flesh I'm not walking by my own
[20:11] mental conception by something that I'm
[20:13] just making up but I'm walking by
[20:15] something that God revealed to me that I
[20:16] have a personal experience with God for
[20:19] though we walk in the flesh we don't war
[20:20] after the flesh right because when we
[20:22] Ward after the flesh we take up a
[20:24] natural shield and a natural sword but
[20:26] we wore but what are we warn against
[20:28] against our memory and our reason and
[20:32] our Consciousness and our affection to
[20:34] destroy the strongholds for the weapons
[20:38] of our Warfare not Coral But Mighty
[20:40] through daughter they're pulling down a
[20:41] strongholds casting down imaginations
[20:43] and every hot thing that exhausted
[20:45] itself against the knowledge of God and
[20:47] bringing into captivity every thought to
[20:49] The Obedience of God and that's what's
[20:51] being destroyed through through God's
[20:55] word amen is everything that we've got
[20:57] built up in our own minds that's
[20:59] countered to God's word when you come to
[21:01] church when you open up the scripture
[21:02] when you read the message and it says
[21:04] what's in your own imagination what's in
[21:07] your reasoning is wrong then that's
[21:09] tearing down right tearing down
[21:12] strongholds and read on down to verse 17
[21:15] and 18 but he that gloryth let him glory
[21:19] in the Lord so now God's given you a
[21:21] revelation does that make you big does
[21:22] that make you a big somebody
[21:24] well in the way it does but not to
[21:27] destroy it not to go out and Destroy
[21:29] other people and say You're nobody
[21:30] because you don't you don't uh maybe see
[21:33] things the way I do if we're not he that
[21:35] commandeth himself is approved by whom
[21:38] the Lord
[21:39] unless uh
[21:43] and this is the one where Paul is
[21:46] telling telling the church that now
[21:48] Corinthians
[21:49] we might say well boy that Corinthian
[21:51] Church had problems look maybe uh we've
[21:55] got the same problems
[21:58] speak brother
[22:02] First Corinthians sorry
[22:08] First Corinthians 14 36 38 that Paul is
[22:12] telling the church how to how to act how
[22:14] to behave how the women should keep
[22:16] silence in church that to cut your hair
[22:18] into how to act and behave and he said
[22:20] what
[22:21] did the word originate from you are you
[22:25] the only people that the word came to
[22:27] yeah if any man thinking himself to be a
[22:29] prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge
[22:31] that the things that I write unto you
[22:33] are the Commandments of the Lord but if
[22:36] any man be ignorant let it be ignorant
[22:38] and that's I think a problem today is If
[22:41] you elevate yourself above God's prophet
[22:43] and say well I know more than the
[22:45] prophet and what does that make you
[22:47] right that makes you you're making
[22:50] yourself a problem right
[22:59] and the smyrnian church age I'm gonna
[23:01] just read this whole quote
[23:04] uh at every age we have exactly the same
[23:06] pattern that is why the light comes
[23:09] through some god-given messenger in a
[23:10] certain area and then from that
[23:12] messenger there's spreads the light
[23:14] through the ministry of others who have
[23:15] been Faithfully taught remember
[23:17] ireneices
[23:19] Apostolic succession
[23:21] the light comes to somebody who's going
[23:23] to stay with the word and then from that
[23:25] mixture spreads to the ministry of
[23:27] others who have been Faithfully taught
[23:29] right there
[23:30] solid in the word and then it goes on
[23:32] and Iranians have laid it out through I
[23:35] believe 14 Generations from Rome to his
[23:38] his day of all the men that stayed with
[23:40] the word but of course all those who go
[23:43] out don't always learn how necessary it
[23:45] is to speak only what the messenger has
[23:47] spoken amen remember Paul wanted people
[23:49] to say only what he said If any man
[23:51] think himself could be a prophet of
[23:53] spiritual let him acknowledge that the
[23:55] things that I write unto you are the
[23:56] Commandments of the Lord
[23:57] what came the word have gone out for me
[23:59] who came into you only they had here
[24:01] take away there as soon the message is
[24:02] no longer pure and the Revival dies down
[24:04] how careful we must be to hear wonderful
[24:07] is the spirit has the wonderfulness
[24:08] which is the voice of God Paul warned
[24:11] him to say what he said even as Peter
[24:12] did likewise he warned them that even he
[24:15] Paul could not change one word of what
[24:17] he had given by Revelation oh how
[24:19] important it is to hear the voice of God
[24:21] by whatever his Messengers and then say
[24:23] what is giving them what has been given
[24:26] their mistakes in the churches that's
[24:27] right and that's so important because I
[24:29] last last night I got to talking with my
[24:32] son Zach about
[24:33] um we were talking about that um there's
[24:35] a company called Monsanto he's putting
[24:37] out hybrid seeds and they're patenting
[24:40] all the all the different seeds that we
[24:42] may have heard about him and uh so um
[24:46] what you buy their seed from
[24:48] plant them in the ground and after you
[24:51] climbing the ground to grow next year
[24:53] you keep the seeds and try to plant
[24:54] those in the ground they won't grow
[24:56] because they're hybrid so you got to go
[24:58] back to Monsanto and buy the next year's
[25:01] seeds and they're trying to uh keep
[25:04] everybody else from uh from Raising
[25:07] seeds so that uh to try to try to create
[25:10] a monopoly and uh boy this will turn up
[25:12] all over the internet people think
[25:13] they're just so evil we got to talk
[25:15] about
[25:16] um I got to talk about Zach about why
[25:18] it's so important that the spoken word
[25:20] is the original sea amen and
[25:22] if you take disposable word The Original
[25:25] Seed and take anything else and add to
[25:27] it or take part of it out of that then
[25:29] it'll never reproduce back to what's in
[25:32] the original and that's why it's so
[25:34] important to stay with the original word
[25:36] which God's Prophet has brought to us
[25:38] because if you get if you get away from
[25:41] us then you're in the same place that
[25:43] you are when Monsanto where you get from
[25:46] them but you'll never be able to to uh
[25:49] and you'll never be able to go back to
[25:51] the original seed if you use that hybrid
[25:54] so now let's look
[25:57] but we think a lot of times like uh in
[26:00] numbers 12 1-10 well we know so much
[26:04] that we can correct God's profit
[26:12] number
[26:23] then y'all I don't I don't believe
[26:25] anybody here
[26:26] is trying to do like this but this this
[26:30] is you start talking to people it is if
[26:32] you see it at this time thought process
[26:34] is becoming really privileged in it
[26:36] today in it that's right it it scares me
[26:38] and I you tell about Mourning this is
[26:41] something to mourn over when somebody
[26:43] that's been in the message for years for
[26:44] 40 or 50 years and then they come around
[26:46] and say well
[26:47] I just don't believe what brother
[26:49] Randall's saying here in so many words
[26:51] they might not say exactly like that but
[26:53] right that um
[26:55] we gotta have a rock to stand on
[27:00] let's look at verse uh let's just start
[27:03] reading in verse one a Miriam and
[27:05] Aaron's fake against Moses because of
[27:07] the Ethiopian woman being married
[27:10] for he getting married an Ethiopian
[27:12] woman
[27:13] and they said hath the Lord and be
[27:14] spoken only by Moses hath he not spoken
[27:17] also by us and the Lord heard it
[27:20] now the man Moses was very meek above
[27:23] all the men which were upon the face of
[27:25] the Earth and remember we talked about
[27:26] meekness before right if you really meet
[27:29] God will fight your battles
[27:31] so Moses here he's not going to rile up
[27:33] and say Aaron and Miriam don't you know
[27:35] better but God comes up and fights his
[27:38] battle right and the Lord speaks
[27:40] suddenly into Moses and unto Aaron and
[27:42] unto Miriam come out you three unto the
[27:44] Tabernacle of the congregation
[27:47] and they three came out
[27:49] after all the many miracles that they
[27:52] had seen after all the signs and wonders
[27:54] that God had part of the Red Sea he had
[27:56] fed them in the wilderness he had done
[27:58] all these things and now Aaron and
[28:00] Miriam rose up and they thought well I I
[28:02] can show God's profit a better way
[28:07] and the Lord speaks suddenly into Moses
[28:09] and unto Aaron and Anthony I'm coming
[28:10] out you three into the Tabernacle of the
[28:13] congregation and they three came out and
[28:15] the Lord came down and the pillar of the
[28:17] cloud and stood in the door of the
[28:18] Tabernacle and called air in the mirror
[28:22] and they both came for you talking about
[28:24] something scary
[28:25] yeah we thought I was scared to be
[28:27] called to the principal's office yeah
[28:30] but the Lord himself is standing in the
[28:32] door of the Tabernacle says Aaron and
[28:33] Miriam come here I want to talk to you
[28:36] and he said here now my words if they're
[28:39] being Prophet among you
[28:40] out of the Lord will make myself known
[28:42] unto him in a vision and will speak a
[28:44] name in a dream my servant Moses is not
[28:46] so
[28:47] who's faithful in all my house with him
[28:50] will I speak mouth to mouth
[28:53] that isn't it all that he didn't say
[28:55] mouth to ear or something like that the
[28:58] words in his mouth the spoken word of
[29:01] the Original Seed the word in God's
[29:02] mouth well he put in Moses mouth
[29:04] delivered to the people right I don't
[29:06] speak to him mouth to mouth
[29:08] even apparently
[29:11] and not in dark speeches and the similar
[29:14] to you to the Lord shall be shall he
[29:16] behold
[29:17] I'm not in dark speeches is what
[29:19] Iranians had to battle with he was
[29:21] battling with something called
[29:22] gnosticism where they said we have these
[29:24] secret Mysteries there's some of the
[29:25] people all of the people will not be
[29:26] privy to will just tell it to just a
[29:29] little uh some of the people but that's
[29:31] not how God does it he does it publicly
[29:33] before everybody not in dark speeches
[29:35] right but before the whole people he had
[29:37] presented his his plan and showed them
[29:40] what kind of um
[29:42] show them his grace and mercy
[29:45] let's see where we're
[29:53] and the anger of the Lord was kindled
[29:55] against them and he departed and the
[29:58] cloud departed from off the Tabernacle
[30:00] and behold Miriam became lepers by the
[30:03] snow and Aaron looked upon Miriam and
[30:05] behold she was leftist and you know
[30:08] brother random talked about when Moses
[30:11] put his hand in his bosom and Drew it
[30:12] out and it was lepers that typified sin
[30:14] and he put it back and it was made just
[30:17] perfectly clean the leprosy is sin sin
[30:20] in your life
[30:21] and uh
[30:23] let's think about what Miriam was doing
[30:26] seeing what's really seeing is is
[30:28] unbelief you see just believe God's word
[30:31] God's provided a way to disbelieve God's
[30:34] profit the thought that she had a better
[30:36] way to do it and and reading further on
[30:38] down Moses intervened and uh God showed
[30:42] her grace amen
[30:44] but uh let's look at the Corinthians
[30:47] book of Correction 1957. no brother what
[30:50] God does is perfect
[30:52] we ain't got no business with our minds
[30:55] doing anything to it just leave it the
[30:58] way it is God did it God said it said it
[31:01] that settles it just take it or don't
[31:03] know how if I could explain it then I'd
[31:05] be equal with God I can't explain it I
[31:07] just believe it
[31:08] that's all that's all I'm asked to do
[31:10] now
[31:12] that doesn't mean a lot of people take
[31:14] this and say well I'm gonna uh
[31:17] adopt that lady Odyssey and spirit of
[31:20] laziness and not even try to understand
[31:22] just getting lazy and uh all I all I
[31:26] know is I believe it and now I'm gonna
[31:27] go home and sit in front of a TV and uh
[31:30] waste away my time and uh but God wants
[31:34] us to press into the kingdom like Paul
[31:36] said because uh that God gave us the
[31:39] word so that we would understand it
[31:41] we'll read a scripture in a second to
[31:44] kind of talk about what what this means
[31:47] that's all that's all I'm asked to do
[31:48] there's nobody has to explain it because
[31:50] it's beyond our intellectuals beyond our
[31:52] intellectuals but it's not beyond the
[31:55] holy spirit
[31:56] it's beyond our intelligence it's God
[31:59] who does it so it cannot be explained
[32:01] not just accepted by faith I say it's my
[32:03] private property and I believe it I
[32:05] cannot explain it so let's look at John
[32:07] chapter six
[32:09] foreign
[32:28] John chapter six
[32:31] verse 53.
[32:35] and I know we've all heard this before
[32:38] but sometimes it's good to just be a
[32:40] reminder
[32:41] then Jesus said unto them verily verily
[32:43] I say and do you accept to you the Flesh
[32:45] of the son of man and drink his blood
[32:47] you have no life and if you're sweet
[32:49] it's my flesh and drinking my blood
[32:51] after eternal life and I will raise him
[32:52] up the last day for my flesh as meat
[32:55] indeed and my blood is drinking beets
[32:56] easy to eat in My Flesh and drinketh my
[32:58] blood growth in me and I am you know as
[33:01] the living father and Sydney and I live
[33:02] by the father so either for me he that
[33:04] he shall live by me this is that bread
[33:07] which came down from heaven not as your
[33:09] father's did he man out or dead either
[33:11] of this bread shall live forever
[33:14] these things sitting in the synagogue
[33:16] who taught in Capernaum many therefore
[33:18] his disciples when they had heard they
[33:20] said this is a hard save you can hear it
[33:23] and so they tossed it out
[33:26] they didn't believe they didn't
[33:27] understand it so they tossed it out
[33:29] that's
[33:34] we just
[33:36] come across people sometimes that
[33:39] if they can't understand it then they
[33:42] I believe that this gospel has the
[33:44] message has everything we need it'll
[33:46] teach you how and the fish how to how to
[33:50] live how to treat your family everything
[33:51] we need you is in the Bible you don't
[33:53] need to go to the bookstore and buy all
[33:55] these books on uh how things how
[33:57] Mesopotamia was in the days of Jesus and
[33:59] all that kind of stuff uh if you know
[34:02] what I'm getting there
[34:04] um just because you don't understand it
[34:05] don't mean to go out you got to go out
[34:07] to the broken sisters and just find what
[34:09] you think what they have to say that
[34:11] everything that you need is in this uh
[34:14] little glass of Mana like part of the
[34:18] Covenant these things let's see and when
[34:20] Jesus knew himself with his disciples
[34:21] murmured at it he said unto them does
[34:23] this offend you
[34:25] you know things a lot of people and they
[34:27] don't understand something what nephew
[34:29] you shall see the son of man Ascend up
[34:31] where he was before it is the spirit
[34:33] that quick enough My Flesh process
[34:36] nothing the words that I speaking to eat
[34:37] our spirit and their life there are some
[34:39] of you that believe not and then jump on
[34:41] down to verse 67 and Jesus said under
[34:43] the 12th we also go away then Simon
[34:46] Peter answered them Lord to whom shall
[34:48] we go yeah I'll ask the lord of the
[34:50] eternal life now they didn't understand
[34:51] it then
[34:53] but just because you understand it don't
[34:55] throw it away right that's right just
[34:56] hang on okay patience that's right be
[34:59] patient and God will reveal it to you
[35:01] and they were patient and then a little
[35:03] bit longer further on down the road when
[35:04] they got to the upper room then they
[35:06] understood what he was talking about now
[35:09] the counter that argument is the the
[35:11] denominational world of the wrong
[35:13] Catholicism and and so forth they said
[35:16] well we'll understand it so we're going
[35:18] to take an intellectual concept and say
[35:19] Well it must be
[35:21] that when the priest says a few little
[35:23] words over the little wafer it turns
[35:25] into actual literal body instead of
[35:28] being patient they came up with
[35:29] something out of their own
[35:30] intellectualism and they came up with
[35:32] something where it's their act they
[35:34] actually believe that that little wafer
[35:36] is the literal Body of Christ and uh
[35:42] so instead of just being patient and
[35:44] waiting on God let me just finish up
[35:46] real quick just one more time more 1963
[35:49] and when a man comes in the anointing of
[35:52] the Holy Ghost and with the word of the
[35:53] Lord would thus saith the Lord you
[35:55] better have sense and try to attack it
[35:56] because you find there's a hand of the
[35:58] Living God and it's heavy
[36:01] God's only provide a place that works at
[36:03] my church we're teaching now but
[36:04] remember when you leave here stop moving
[36:06] out of the truck now you're going in the
[36:07] green but lay in the presence of the sun
[36:09] don't add to what I've said don't take
[36:11] away what I've said because I speak the
[36:13] truth as far as I know it as the father
[36:15] has given to me so you don't add to it
[36:17] just say what I said and then if you say
[36:20] just what he said you believe what he
[36:22] said you know he said what Paul said you
[36:25] can have faith in it
