[1:05] the part there on the left hand bleep up
[1:07] we've got just a few more slides and
[1:09] then we'll just go as quick as possible
[1:10] now so so what is circumcision of our
[1:14] circumcision of the heart means the Holy
[1:16] Spirit going in and doing her work in
[1:18] the heart of man cutting off excess
[1:20] flesh you cannot be circumcised
[1:24] spiritually if the Holy Spirit is not
[1:25] taken oh right right again you can't
[1:29] give up nothing in your life without the
[1:32] Holy Spirit working in your life try
[1:33] drinking smoking none of that
[1:37] you'll do it and you feel okay that's
[1:39] right if the Holy Spirit doesn't tell
[1:41] you hey this isn't right for Kristen
[1:43] that dude you'll just keep on doing it
[1:45] right but the whole universe is a thing
[1:48] we can't be people's Holy Spirit you can
[1:51] close such-and-such brother or such a
[1:53] sighs sister though they're still doing
[1:55] this let the Lord do this all right
[1:57] and we don't do don't rush to work with
[1:59] God in there and let's just be patient
[2:01] with people that's B that's because God
[2:05] was patient with us right now
[2:06] amen now if this has nothing to do with
[2:09] the flesh and again it yet it does
[2:12] because the work starts from the inside
[2:14] out we were speaking about this last
[2:16] night at the Bible study which really
[2:19] don't miss don't worry there yeah there
[2:23] was there was there was some interesting
[2:25] topics some interesting things that had
[2:27] were discussed some some bouts between
[2:30] sister Trudy and brothers
[2:38] a huge American thing Avenue that's just
[2:41] a visa and I'm just joking for the
[2:45] people in the internet we got a good
[2:47] time I don't know why she's turning red
[2:49] no h-he got stragglers killing it you
[2:52] need to introduce them all okay welcome
[3:00] everybody welcome
[3:02] god bless y'all have a seat welcome to
[3:05] the house of God tell me later bro all
[3:18] right and this is just last week so to
[3:23] obtain a closer walk with Christ you
[3:25] must have a change from within which
[3:27] which will then manifest on the outside
[3:29] where the brand says here the
[3:32] circumcision is a type of the Holy Ghost
[3:34] then God gave Abraham the circumcision
[3:36] signed after he had accepted God on his
[3:40] promise and walked out into a strange
[3:43] country see it was a sign and all his
[3:47] children and his seed after him should
[3:50] have the Sun in their flesh because it
[3:53] was a distinction that's right that was
[3:56] back then it was to separate them from
[3:58] all all other people in this town of
[4:00] circumcision and that's what God uses
[4:02] today is the sign of circumcision of the
[4:04] heart the holy spirit that makes God's
[4:07] church a separated church from all of
[4:09] the Creed's faiths and denominations
[4:11] there in all kinds of denominations but
[4:14] yet they are two separated people God
[4:17] knows his own ever man and God knows the
[4:20] exact time when they're gonna come out
[4:24] so in God from the beginning was more
[4:27] interested in the heart than anything
[4:28] else
[4:29] physical circumcision we won't read all
[4:31] Deuteronomy but look what verse 16 said
[4:33] I mean this is back in Moses time verse
[4:36] 16 circumcise therefore the foreskin of
[4:38] your heart God already talking about the
[4:42] foreskin of your heart not just the
[4:44] foreskin the foreskin of your heart and
[4:46] be no more stiff neck but so the whole
[4:50] thing see I was discussing this with my
[4:52] wife Waldo
[4:54] even when God gave him the law the Ten
[4:56] Commandments he knew they were not going
[4:58] to be able to keep those for those those
[5:00] Commandments but he wanted them to
[5:02] realize that they can do and so and so
[5:06] that's the reason so that therefore
[5:08] grace could take over and Paul speaks
[5:10] about those things on their own so we
[5:13] can't hide behind the nomination walls
[5:15] or wall the works or any type of fleshly
[5:17] material wall you know those things are
[5:21] man-made cannot keep call God statues
[5:24] and I was in Europe even though God
[5:26] required it in the Old Testament this to
[5:30] show and to fructose that we can depend
[5:32] upon physical circumcision or external
[5:34] changes of the flesh to live the life of
[5:36] God it's all about Christ in you the
[5:39] hope of glory so if you want price in
[5:41] your life get the King of glory in your
[5:43] heart now look what Romans chapter 2 if
[5:50] you read Romans chapter 2 bits up the
[5:52] whole chapter when you get some time but
[5:54] this is very interesting it's just mr.
[5:56] stream it says here verse 17 behold our
[5:59] called a Jew and rest isn't the law and
[6:01] makest thy boast of God and knowest his
[6:04] will and approve us the things that are
[6:06] more excellent being instructed out of
[6:08] the law and are confident the Dalai self
[6:11] are a guide of the blind the light of
[6:13] them which are in darkness and
[6:15] instructor the foolish a teacher of aids
[6:17] which has the form of knowledge and of
[6:19] the truth in the law Pharisees had to
[6:24] seize all these people they did
[6:27] everything external but again when
[6:31] Christ came on the scene the Messiah
[6:33] that they were saying he's come
[6:36] he's coming and when he came he came the
[6:38] way the day a different total way they
[6:41] didn't accept the word for their hour
[6:44] now therefore which teaches another
[6:47] teach us not thyself
[6:48] now that preaches the man should not
[6:51] steal this house
[6:52] thou that say as a man should not commit
[6:55] adultery there's now committed notice
[6:56] now that of course idols of document
[6:58] sacrilege
[6:59] now that makest thy boast of the law
[7:01] through breaking the law dishonours
[7:03] though God for the name of God is
[7:06] blasting among the Gentiles through you
[7:08] as it is written once verse 25 for
[7:09] circumcision barely property this is
[7:13] Paul speaking but him being circumcised
[7:16] himself convenient you if thou keep the
[7:20] law but if thou be a breaker of the law
[7:22] thy circumcision is made uncircumcision
[7:25] alright therefore if the uncircumcision
[7:29] keep the righteousness of the law shall
[7:31] not his circumcision be counted for
[7:34] circumcision now Paul's gettin into
[7:36] spiritual the spiritual aspect now in
[7:38] other words the the Jew you and me if we
[7:42] keep the law again shouldn't that be
[7:46] considered to us as as we were
[7:48] circumcised you see but you can't keep
[7:51] the law unless you have the Holy Spirit
[7:54] the law is not just the Ten Commandments
[7:56] the law is the whole Word of God but
[8:00] it's not a book of rules so where the
[8:01] deal was talking about it it's the grace
[8:03] of God for trait to each and every one
[8:05] of us and in those Ten Commandments is
[8:08] the grace of God because again the
[8:12] lettuce no I can't do it Lord okay let
[8:15] me step
[8:16] that's what God wants amen and shall not
[8:22] uncircumcision which is by nature if it
[8:24] fulfill the law judge thee who by the
[8:26] letter and circumcision does transgress
[8:28] the law for he is not a Jew which is one
[8:30] outwardly so it has nothing to do with
[8:33] physical again hearing them in the
[8:36] message and not just in the message but
[8:38] in the nomination of rim you get it the
[8:40] Pentecostal Holiness and all the
[8:42] Pentecostal that believe in women
[8:44] dressing right and things like that but
[8:47] they can get so stuck on that outside oh
[8:49] the hair is long
[8:51] the dresses are long everything is right
[8:54] but but they don't they don't live right
[8:57] at home but on the outside they're okay
[9:00] but on the inside they're full of dead
[9:04] men's bones like Jesus mm but you can
[9:08] have a pair all the way down here but
[9:12] you still not make it but your tongue D
[9:15] that long to see has nothing to do with
[9:20] your hair being that long or he is not a
[9:24] Jew which is one outwardly neither is
[9:26] that circumcision which is outward in
[9:29] the flesh
[9:30] Paul referring to spiritual but he is a
[9:33] Jew which is one inwardly and
[9:35] circumcision is that of the heart in the
[9:39] spirit and not in the letter
[9:41] so again Paul says another play the
[9:44] letter killeth but the spirit giveth
[9:45] life the commandments kill you
[9:48] can kill you the do's and don'ts will
[9:50] kill you the do's and don'ts will kill
[9:52] people again when you come into this
[9:54] message or when you receive the word
[9:56] it's a we're off we all come in a
[9:59] legalist then you realize at some point
[10:04] wait a second this isn't
[10:05] good point right there when your
[10:10] children start doing things that you
[10:11] thought that they weren't going to do
[10:14] then you change your mind about things
[10:16] then in disparity not in the letter
[10:19] whose praise is not of men but of God
[10:22] that's the reason Saints you know I pray
[10:26] for my children I put them before the
[10:27] Lord but in the in my mind I'm thinking
[10:31] Lord if you don't do the work I won't be
[10:34] surprised if if if they go straight I'm
[10:38] not claiming that but if they go astray
[10:40] Lord the word has already been there I
[10:42] thought we've already presented the work
[10:44] for them
[10:45] you do the work after that way but I I'm
[10:48] not going to condemn other people's
[10:50] children do they do this that that when
[10:52] later on my children might do the same
[10:54] thing or worse a physical circumcision
[11:00] was the key when they were when with
[11:02] then why were the sons of day come back
[11:04] stabbers if physicals are considered
[11:08] back thing was appealing literally they
[11:10] killed Shechem the son of Haman in order
[11:12] to give it a bench for Dinah their
[11:14] sister you read that in Genesis 34 so
[11:16] they had circumcision back then frizam
[11:18] but they went ahead and killed you know
[11:21] they were Jacob sons were backstabbers
[11:23] and they were murdering Meyers lying to
[11:26] their father by Joseph fornicators and
[11:28] adulterers yet they were physically
[11:30] circumcised
[11:35] the Pharisees were physically
[11:37] circumcised does that mean there were
[11:39] all children of God
[11:40] no but Jesus called them whitewashed
[11:43] tombs something more money said your
[11:46] father to do this works you think but
[11:49] they were physically circumcised
[11:51] again looking at this on the spiritual
[11:52] aspect you can know you can know again
[11:56] we're talking to last night you can know
[11:58] all mysteries Hall has the Paul said you
[12:01] can know the whole word you can know
[12:03] every revelation upon Revelation but if
[12:06] the life is not manifested the Holy
[12:09] Spirit is not working in you manifesting
[12:11] on the outside changing you and desire
[12:13] and making you desire to be more like
[12:15] Christ day by day then all those
[12:19] mysteries all that knowledge is for
[12:21] naught right
[12:22] it's just puff puff just makes you
[12:25] puffed up but inside we're filled with
[12:27] corruption and dead men's bones you read
[12:29] that Matthew twenty thirty seven Judas
[12:32] was also circumcised physically did that
[12:34] stop him from doing what he did to the
[12:36] Lord Jesus no so how can God start
[12:40] circumcised in our hearts hmm Leviticus
[12:45] 26 41 it says in that I also have walk
[12:49] contrary unto them and have brought them
[12:51] into the land owners if then they're
[12:53] uncertain sounds hard to be humble and
[12:56] they then accept of the punishment of
[12:59] their iniquity humility is important
[13:04] point in order to come to Christ you
[13:07] hear the word and in order for you to
[13:11] receive his word you have to humble
[13:12] yourself if you don't humble yourself
[13:15] you know what the time I heard the work
[13:17] I had to
[13:18] so I realize Lord I'm nothing I'm
[13:21] nothing and if without you I cannot
[13:24] change I wanted to change but I couldn't
[13:27] change and you come to that point where
[13:30] humility that's what God is saying there
[13:32] uncertainty sighs it's hard to be humble
[13:34] which are going kind of quickly but you
[13:36] know the time is limited so we must
[13:39] first humble our hearts before God can
[13:41] begin circumcised in our harvest humble
[13:44] yourself repent be baptized in the Lord
[13:47] Jesus Christ God and then God says the
[13:50] Holy Spirit starts working in your life
[13:52] you'll start cutting things in your life
[13:54] your mom won't have to tell you anything
[13:56] in this case nobody your pastor will
[13:59] have to tell you anything your friends
[14:00] want to tell you anything
[14:01] God will point out to you exactly what
[14:04] needs to start being cut from your life
[14:06] and he'll do it that's part of
[14:09] circumcision of the heart you know right
[14:13] now you might there's something in your
[14:15] life you might be struggling with or you
[14:18] don't think it's okay you know it's this
[14:22] point but don't be surprised is the Holy
[14:26] Spirit
[14:26] you know later on they say look that's
[14:29] not right for a Christian
[14:34] because it is a constant sanctification
[14:37] it's not just sanctification one time
[14:40] it's not justification one time no it's
[14:42] a constant justification and the
[14:44] constant sanctification in the believers
[14:46] life favor
[14:47] Paul said being born again right it's a
[14:52] constant being born again so it's not
[14:56] just dying out one time and that's it no
[14:59] I'm just I'm sure there's things that
[15:01] have to die out in me but at a later
[15:04] point that right now I may not may not I
[15:07] may not realize but later on I may have
[15:09] to do to die off to certain things you
[15:11] know so that's why you say Lord examine
[15:14] my heart show me where I'm wrong tell me
[15:17] in a humble me because when your homeboy
[15:20] Amen and have more greater effect on the
[15:23] people amen wait you're sleeping okay
[15:28] yeah so how do we begin to humble
[15:33] ourselves by having faith in the Word of
[15:35] God believing this word all right
[15:37] well Graham says lord I feel that's
[15:40] right that's a crumb come on that's how
[15:42] what you have to do come are we ready to
[15:45] take the crumbs speaking of this
[15:46] ceremony shamone
[15:48] are we ready to humble ourselves she was
[15:50] she was ready to humper herself faith
[15:53] always admits the word right faith is
[15:57] always humbled brothers brother was last
[16:02] night speaking when he was talking he
[16:04] said when you can't accept the word
[16:06] being right and you can't admit the word
[16:08] being right when once you do that that's
[16:11] that's your new birth no part of
[16:13] receiving the word but if you don't say
[16:16] if you can't accept Jesus Christ the
[16:17] same yesterday today forever like that
[16:22] you have
[16:25] they always admits the word right faith
[16:27] is always humble faith humbles itself
[16:29] now she was just looking for the crumbs
[16:33] watch what Jesus said for this same for
[16:35] this thing I'm willing to take the
[16:37] crumbs Lord for this thing
[16:38] my child is hold you you have your
[16:42] request because you believe it
[16:44] faith admits that the Word of God is
[16:45] Right faith and let's all these things
[16:49] praise the Lord
[16:51] so how can God start circumcised in our
[16:53] heart this is beautiful you remember
[16:57] when David came when he had done his sin
[17:00] with Bathsheba and then and then that
[17:03] nathan who was in Nathan the Prophet he
[17:06] came to Nathan the Prophet he said hey
[17:11] look
[17:11] David's out there doing wrong you could
[17:14] go talk to him tell him this this this
[17:16] this and that
[17:17] so Nathan goes to him - David tells him
[17:21] what's what's wrong and of course
[17:24] David's think you know you know hey
[17:26] speak to me the word of the Lord what do
[17:28] you have to say proper than opinion or
[17:30] prophet Nathan he's like he tells him
[17:33] what he did and say look he took another
[17:35] man's wife and you had him killed and
[17:39] you don't even deserve to be a king and
[17:43] what does David do it mediate listen did
[17:47] he say Oh get out of my court no he
[17:52] didn't kick him out he humbled himself
[17:54] right there and
[17:56] he did from because that man had the
[17:58] word of the Lord Network and he started
[18:01] East he started having a repentant heart
[18:04] but but what's this
[18:06] even before David got because later on
[18:10] he gets down to the to the actual act of
[18:12] of repenting and you can read his
[18:15] repentance in Genesis and now in Psalms
[18:17] 52 I believe one of those songs there
[18:20] but even before he got down to that
[18:22] actual act of repentance Nathan the
[18:24] prophet at that meeting told him don't
[18:26] worry the Lord has already forgiven
[18:28] yourself because why because God knew
[18:32] his heart I knew that he was really
[18:34] repented so he was humbled and so David
[18:39] had to first have faith in the word of
[18:41] Nathan to Humble himself of course which
[18:43] led him to repentance and this is a
[18:46] scripture behold of Psalm 51 with what
[18:50] David says here behold thou desirous
[18:52] truth in the inward parts not on the
[18:56] outward part is now desires truth in the
[18:59] inward parts and in the hidden part that
[19:02] shall make me to know wisdom has to do
[19:05] with the heart that's to do with him
[19:07] from the inside out and then burst tank
[19:10] create in me a clean heart O God and
[19:12] renew a right spirit within me now we
[19:15] need David that wasn't a new birth maybe
[19:18] David in the Old Testament Saints you
[19:20] know they didn't have the new birth
[19:21] because Christ had come and died offered
[19:24] himself and all that but they could feel
[19:27] an anointing upon you you know they
[19:29] could feel you know they could feel they
[19:31] could bit like brother Desmond speaking
[19:32] about they had a form of salvation right
[19:39] so David realized what it was like to
[19:42] live with and without God spirit verse
[19:45] 10 David put together the act of good
[19:47] clean heart in him with renew a right
[19:50] spirit within again not the new birth
[19:54] who can give us the right spirit but the
[19:56] holy spirit himself yeah I can't do it
[20:01] on my own it was up to me I'd still be
[20:05] party yes they'll be drinking trying to
[20:08] please my friends yeah yeah that's it I
[20:14] have something different for you anyway
[20:16] one day when I was a senior I'll still
[20:18] in brother direct my testimony the other
[20:20] day we're just kind of testifying to
[20:22] each other the other day and at my
[20:26] senior year in high school I said Lord I
[20:28] are he stopped I have to stop living
[20:30] this life I can't go on like this
[20:32] anymore trying to please my friends and
[20:34] my parents at the same time and thinking
[20:36] I've shown a certain life in front of my
[20:38] parents
[20:38] and yet living a certain life in front
[20:40] of my friends lord I it's a terrible
[20:42] life to live in a direct way you know
[20:44] when you're not living for Christ so
[20:49] it's the Holy Spirit that can genuinely
[20:50] circumcise our hearts from all unbelief
[20:52] no I'm believe is sin amen all of us
[20:58] need to more to be cut out of our lives
[21:00] not just from the outside but from the
[21:02] inside out what good will it do a
[21:06] drunkard to empty his liquor bottles and
[21:08] he still has that desire within
[21:09] that's right now what good will it be
[21:12] for smoker to throw away this pack of
[21:14] cigarettes and these guys and desire to
[21:16] smoke that's right there's no good well
[21:20] good well the thing where you get rid of
[21:22] hip hop rock and roll country music CDs
[21:24] or mp3s be stuff and desire to listen to
[21:26] that music
[21:30] what good will it do a man who put
[21:32] Internet filters on his computer in his
[21:33] home in order to not visit appropriate
[21:35] websites and he still has that desire to
[21:37] visit those sites again rather have
[21:45] their work started the desire to come
[21:48] from inside out I came in this is why we
[21:52] have to take God's Word just as he said
[21:54] it they think God's Word humble
[21:56] ourselves then God can go changing us
[21:58] from within
[22:00] when David did this look how different
[22:02] his thoughts and actions were even
[22:04] before the new birth came in the picture
[22:06] and and I have some examples here
[22:11] because God responded to Dana's
[22:13] repentance with grace David show grace
[22:15] to others after that true wicked with
[22:19] epsilon and Epsilon
[22:20] his son son rebelled against him was
[22:23] about to overtake before to take the
[22:25] kingdom of David fled to Jerusalem with
[22:27] those who followed him he said okay I
[22:29] have so long ago had to do what you need
[22:31] to do it neatly yeah he was willing to
[22:32] just you know this his David showed more
[22:38] Grace and more humbleness you know after
[22:40] his what happened to him even before the
[22:46] new birth a minute
[22:49] and the man by the name of Shiva came
[22:52] out to curse David one time and to throw
[22:54] stones at Amina read this in second
[22:55] samuel 16 i wish i wanted to cut his
[22:58] head wanted to cut shimai his head but
[23:01] david would not allow him to do so
[23:05] instead when they would return to
[23:07] jerusalem one of those there to meet and
[23:09] welcome him was she me and himself the
[23:10] one who threw rocks at me who confessed
[23:13] to David that he had sinned in what he
[23:15] had tried to do to him a bashar once
[23:20] again wanted to execution me and this
[23:21] time he had a biblical reason if you
[23:24] read that he tells him he called
[23:26] attention to the fact that she mean he
[23:27] had cursed David the king of Israel and
[23:30] the law of Moses forbade cursing the
[23:31] ruler of the people so David knew this
[23:35] and shame EA should have been put to
[23:39] death but David forgave him and granted
[23:41] him his life amen
[23:45] so David's
[23:49] it was like God called vena the man
[23:51] after my own heart
[23:54] David realized you know it's all about
[23:56] the inward parts Lord it's all about me
[23:59] working within
[24:01] God called him in this even before he
[24:05] was king of Israel actually knew that
[24:07] what state that wasn't famous party and
[24:10] because God loved David he had to be
[24:13] punished for his sin God doesn't punish
[24:15] those that are not his god doesn't that
[24:20] God doesn't review those who was he
[24:22] gonna waste his time you know but he
[24:24] doesn't have time why is he gonna you
[24:27] know with those that are not his you
[24:30] know I'm glad he does that that way I'm
[24:36] sure you know because some if he just
[24:40] lets us get by with whatever you know if
[24:41] I just let my daughter's get by with
[24:43] whatever happens in whatever they do in
[24:45] their life there is going to be speech
[24:47] spoiled and you know but we can't let
[24:49] him move so if we don't allow it in the
[24:51] physical with our own children how much
[24:53] more God he cares for his own thing
[24:57] alright and this is the last slide
[25:01] Hebrews 12:5 curtain and II have
[25:04] forgotten the exhortation which speaketh
[25:06] unto you as unto children my son despise
[25:10] not thou the chastening of the Lord nor
[25:12] faint when thou art rebuked of him in
[25:15] other words don't get weary don't get
[25:17] tired that means you can you you
[25:21] fail the tests and so you need to pass
[25:22] it you need to take it again that means
[25:27] X actually gets grace God have many
[25:30] chances not just a God with one chance
[25:34] two chances three Peter remember Peter
[25:37] asked him Lord how many times I forgive
[25:39] my brother Nathan Jesus said yeah but is
[25:41] it seven times seven times I have 70
[25:46] done but that doesn't mean 400 and what
[25:48] for honey 498 doesn't mean more than 90
[25:51] x squared that's just the metaphor or
[25:54] sub to represent and hey forgive them
[25:57] many times unlimited times my brother
[26:01] Dan was saying last night you'll forgive
[26:04] him now
[26:05] as humans we can't forget but that's the
[26:10] thing we're brother branham people would
[26:12] walk around him and you wouldn't be able
[26:13] to tell who was his enemies and we'll
[26:15] who was his friends he'd treat them all
[26:17] the same
[26:18] I want the Holy Spirit to do a work in
[26:20] my life that that can happen in my life
[26:22] where you can see exactly hey you're my
[26:25] enemy you did this to me but I'm gonna
[26:27] still treat you like my friend but
[26:29] because that person soul is more
[26:32] important than whatever you did to me if
[26:35] I can win that soldier amen
[26:37] that's worth it ten thousand worlds and
[26:40] the only way you're gonna win a soul is
[26:42] by showing love not hate all forgiveness
[26:45] is the truth but I'm not gonna forget it
[26:49] you're doing damage to the person you're
[26:53] still you're still holding something
[26:54] there like one you know one time
[26:57] somebody said he's a Christian too but I
[27:00] forget he said you know what movies
[27:03] you know he said he said if I wasn't a
[27:10] Christian right now because I did I had
[27:13] done something to him I should have done
[27:15] he said if I if I wasn't a Christian I
[27:17] would rip your face open right now I'm
[27:20] thinking blazing a Christian doesn't
[27:23] even talk that way you shouldn't at
[27:26] least like he meant it did so anyways
[27:33] verse six for whom the Lord loveth he
[27:35] chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom
[27:38] he receiveth verse seven aphelion their
[27:42] chastening God dealeth with us with sons
[27:45] what son is he whom the father chase an
[27:47] anomaly but if ye be without
[27:50] chastisement we're of are all partakers
[27:52] then are you bastards and not sons in
[27:56] other words if you go without punishment
[27:58] and you're just a bastard child
[28:00] spiritually and you're not his son
[28:03] furthermore we have had fathers of our
[28:05] flesh which corrected us going to the
[28:08] physical our parents and we gave them
[28:10] reverence
[28:10] I don't know children now they do that
[28:13] but I didn't we do we also grown up you
[28:16] know modern you know slippers being
[28:18] thrown at us and the belt Hickory sticks
[28:20] and all kinds of things but you know
[28:29] what I still I still love my mom and dad
[28:32] yeah I'm thankful for them
[28:35] and get my mom and dad did that my mom
[28:37] did those things when she was not
[28:39] Christian nowadays she sees and she even
[28:42] feels bad when I even pulled out a belt
[28:44] expecting them like that but look mom
[28:48] you've had your yahoo let let us have
[28:50] our time and out you know he was because
[28:52] he has grandparent until she's got great
[28:54] bird mentality because this is our time
[28:56] now this you know him but my mom you
[29:01] know she tells me she says she says son
[29:04] you know I feel bad you know some of the
[29:07] things that we said to you all that we
[29:10] did did and we did it ignorantly they
[29:13] were not Christians you know my mom and
[29:17] dad you know my dad you know there be
[29:21] cursing in the house and stuff like that
[29:23] you know I grew up that way cursing and
[29:26] all kinds of things and Doug but because
[29:29] they didn't love the Lord you know they
[29:30] were in Christian era Catholics back
[29:31] then well once that that changed in
[29:34] their life that was one of the first
[29:36] things that started changing in my mom's
[29:37] life it was the way she would do layers
[29:39] and you knew the Lord was working now if
[29:42] you know she for the way you wouldn't
[29:44] think she'd be that way
[29:47] never mind that your home will be
[29:50] different it's just how the Lord does
[29:53] that work it's totally changes hearing
[29:55] that totally changes you're going one
[29:57] direction and continue to 180 degrees
[30:01] or the other way totally the other way
[30:03] that's the kind of work that God doesn't
[30:05] realize that's the circumcision of the
[30:07] heart up your neck so we gave them
[30:12] reverence shall we not much rather be in
[30:15] subjection unto the father of the
[30:16] spirits and live
[30:17] verse 10 for verily for a few days
[30:20] chastened us after their own pleasure
[30:27] but he God for our profit for our profit
[30:32] that we might be partakers of his
[30:34] holiness I like that image yes God has
[30:38] no other purpose but for you to be more
[30:40] like him that's the reason why he'll
[30:43] what is this happen in my life it just
[30:45] wants you to be like me
[30:47] or why are you doing this to me it just
[30:50] wants you to be like him that's all so
[30:54] we just thank the Lord amen so how many
[30:57] I was able to get done with part three
[30:59] now this is the last part of itself so
[31:04] again
[31:05] circumcision was instituted back in the
[31:08] Old Testament through with Abraham as a
[31:11] sign right but spiritually we are
[31:16] spiritually circumcised the Holy Ghost
[31:17] is the token and he as though he's the
[31:20] sign right but he's the one who does the
[31:22] circumcision cutting off excess flesh in
[31:25] our heart in our lives
[31:27] amen
[31:28] again let the Holy Spirit do the work
[31:30] not just in your life let the Holy
[31:32] Spirit do the work in other people's
[31:33] life but stop the condemning you know
[31:36] it's so easy for us to do that let's
[31:39] just let the Lord do the work and he
[31:43] does it the best and we didn't do it
[31:45] it's like we can't change our children
[31:48] let them have their own experience with
[31:50] God let them when they got that
[31:52] experience with God they have no change
[31:54] when you try to force the experience in
[31:57] their life that won't work that's the
[32:01] dupe has to be gutted
[32:03] it's got any questions any comments we
[32:05] have bottle nuts but then when somebody
[32:11] does and despicable being to be I
[32:16] remember it but I find it very difficult
[32:21] forgiving yeah it's not easy for none of
[32:31] us then it can be done and you're
[32:38] talking about the Holy Spirit sometimes
[32:40] that then that I've noticed since I've
[32:43] become pretty thick in the word that the
[32:47] Holy Spirit doesn't work just from well
[32:50] you might work from within but with me
[32:54] chasing women and drinking and all that
[32:57] the women hate me I didn't do that and I
[33:02] don't I don't have the taste for it
[33:04] anymore I didn't do that I got a couple
[33:07] cases of booze in my closet it's sitting
[33:10] there forever and so it's not me doing
[33:12] this my choice would be the other way
[33:14] okay so maybe the Holy Spirit shines a
[33:20] bright light these women's eyes and runs
[33:21] them off you know
[33:23] so I just uh you know read then go when
[33:37] you get serious with God
[33:39] he'll mean business with you I'm not
[33:41] saying you're not meaning so this that
[33:42] was God he's serious sometimes he turns
[33:45] you around when you're like it or not
[33:46] that that freak step elder Dale is stuck
[33:49] in my head he turns you around right now
[33:51] yeah but at the same time he's not gonna
[33:54] force you to do nothing that you don't
[33:55] want to do Oh gentlemen but when you
[33:58] threat you see this a kind of a
[34:00] disclaimer when you pray you say I'd
[34:03] give my life to to Jesus Christ you're
[34:06] done you can fight it any minute turn
[34:09] you around and you know you can't get
[34:13] out of it yeah
[34:14] so your life is mine and now with that
[34:17] but I've also given my son's and all the
[34:19] sons for a thousand years so I told my
[34:22] son's the other day but your life starts
[34:24] going going down and getting problematic
[34:26] you give me a call but that will be
[34:30] square sometimes when you send the holy
[34:35] rap from you gotta let him do the work
[34:39] sometimes it'd be the one who the
[34:41] working let's do it anyway yeah sure
[34:44] well he's gonna he's gonna he's gonna
[34:48] bring you to a point where you are going
[34:49] to accept what he's trying to do in your
[34:51] life yeah you may not say that yeah but
[34:55] afterwards you'll go without you only
[34:56] way that's the only way and it comes
[34:58] when God does something it's like we do
[35:00] something late mistake but dog does
[35:03] something his hands in it it's perfect
[35:05] it's gotta be he can't do anything
[35:06] halfway along so whatever he does even
[35:11] if he has to put you in a hospital sure
[35:13] even in the s I mean you're up there at
[35:15] death you see the white the white light
[35:17] at the tunnel and even at that point God
[35:21] is doing exactly what he needs to do he
[35:23] knows exactly how to deal with each one
[35:25] of us he doesn't deal with us in every
[35:26] the same way he knows exactly how to
[35:28] deal with you he doesn't exactly how to
[35:30] deal with me he knows exactly how to
[35:32] deal with you birthday therefore let's
[35:36] just be mindful of that and sometimes we
[35:38] wonder lord is this that this has happen
[35:40] to me in my life right now
[35:42] step back and say Lord is this you know
[35:45] and because now nothing that happens to
[35:48] have it happens just to happen
[35:51] I believe God everything you know yeah
[35:53] for your Christian even your footsteps
[35:56] or the footsteps of the righteous are
[35:57] ordered by the Lord my Bible says Amen
[36:00] god bless self image
[36:04] [Music]
