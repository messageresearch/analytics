[0:07] okay should we just heart everybody
[0:18] and is that is that facing them in its
[0:27] own accord it's needed to position it
[0:29] but yeah
[0:30] you often just make sure I'm always on
[0:32] the camera man usually brother Ryan's
[0:35] the one who's teaching there this
[0:39] morning
[0:40] brother Bob's not here so alright well
[0:51] we'll just go ahead and get started I
[0:52] hope everyone's doing well and has had a
[0:57] good weekend and and I can't believe
[1:01] it's almost Thanksgiving and this year
[1:03] is almost over so this this last part of
[1:07] the year usually goes faster than the
[1:09] than the first part of the I don't know
[1:12] exact all right now this year - yeah
[1:17] yeah all right so listen we're gonna go
[1:25] ahead and we're gonna read from Luke
[1:27] chapter 17 Luke chapter 17 and we're
[1:32] just gonna read a little a little story
[1:35] here and I know that you all are
[1:37] probably familiar with this story but
[1:39] we're gonna read it I just kind of glean
[1:41] some things from it and a little bit
[1:45] about Thanksgiving all right
[1:51] Luke 17 verse 11 and it says here and it
[1:54] came to pass as he went to Jerusalem
[1:57] Jesus going to Jerusalem that he passed
[2:00] through the midst of Samaria and Galilee
[2:03] now I want you to notice where he was
[2:05] passing through he was passing through
[2:07] the midst of Samaria and Galilee Samaria
[2:10] being where the Samaritans live they're
[2:13] half Jew half Gentile okay they were
[2:16] despised people by the Jews the Jews did
[2:19] not like them because
[2:20] have Gentile mixed with them and then
[2:23] you want to have anything to do with
[2:24] Gentile so it goes on and says and as he
[2:28] entered into a certain village there met
[2:30] him ten men that were lepers which stood
[2:34] far off so the lepers the lepers were
[2:38] far from him they were not in close
[2:40] proximity to him there were they met him
[2:43] they saw they and they probably heard
[2:45] that Jesus was coming they probably
[2:48] heard of the things that Jesus was doing
[2:50] the miracles that were taking place in
[2:52] Jesus's life and then and then these
[2:56] these lepers they see them coming from
[2:58] far off and you know back then leprosy
[3:03] but you know as horrible as leprosy is
[3:06] some of those some of us who are from
[3:09] third world countries I mean know you
[3:11] know that you see it there a lot and I
[3:15] we were near leper colony in the
[3:18] Philippines there near were brother
[3:20] Danny dumpling those house is and but
[3:23] the leper colony isn't I don't think
[3:25] it's there anymore but but they're still
[3:28] leprosy still going on for the salmon
[3:31] went to it okay and so yeah it's still
[3:35] going on and there's still a few cases
[3:37] here and there especially down towards
[3:40] the border of Mexico and us you'll still
[3:43] hear little cases here and there of
[3:45] leprosy but it's it's a terrible disease
[3:47] and and it starts but it starts eating
[3:49] your skin it starts eating your limbs
[3:51] off and you start feeling numb at the at
[3:54] the end of your limbs and where you
[3:55] don't even feel that your nerves start
[3:59] dying so you don't even feel that your
[4:01] nose is falling off you don't even think
[4:03] you just you just you just know that it
[4:05] is and you know it's very gruesome and
[4:09] not not only that but since collects is
[4:12] rotting and I don't know if you ever
[4:13] smelled of rotting flesh dead flesh it
[4:16] stinks now I'm just trying to give you
[4:19] this picture of what these ten lepers
[4:21] were like they probably stunk
[4:23] they probably and
[4:25] they were hung hanging out together and
[4:27] they were not even with their families
[4:30] anymore he you see when they were when
[4:32] they when you were consider a leper and
[4:34] you were a bona fide leper according to
[4:36] the law of Yemen and Leviticus you were
[4:40] supposed to be cast out you were
[4:41] supposed to be separated from your
[4:43] people from friends these these men
[4:46] probably had businesses these men
[4:48] probably had jobs families they were
[4:51] probably thriving and then also and this
[4:52] comes upon them and so you could see how
[4:55] they were very uh they you know Jesus
[4:58] was coming let me do what I can to get
[5:01] his attention there's a lepers back then
[5:03] what they would do is they really
[5:05] exercised their their screaming in their
[5:08] voice because they had to either to get
[5:12] attention from for help for from people
[5:15] but to also to let people know hey we're
[5:18] lepers stay away and so they were used
[5:20] to always shouting and and and and you
[5:23] know using the high-pitched voice you
[5:25] know so that's the case of these lepers
[5:29] here so in verse 12 in verse 13 and they
[5:34] lifted up their voices and said see you
[5:37] see how they lifted up their voices
[5:39] because they were not in close proximity
[5:40] to Jesus they were screaming and said
[5:43] Jesus master have mercy on us and when
[5:48] he saw them now verse 14 and when he saw
[5:51] them he said unto them to me it seems
[5:55] like Jesus was approaching them he heard
[5:59] them so he was gonna go to them he's
[6:02] gonna saying because in order for it it
[6:04] wasn't like he was yelling to him yeah
[6:08] he didn't say he lifted his voice it
[6:10] looks like he was approaching to him now
[6:11] how many how many of us would if we had
[6:14] lepers screaming out at us would we go
[6:16] an approach time you know I'm getting
[6:19] out of
[6:21] you know how I'm so visual I need to
[6:23] show but but you see how Jesus was
[6:29] approaching them he wasn't scared he
[6:31] wouldn't be like most of us you know oh
[6:33] no he's the leopard get away I believe
[6:36] God healed you yeah but you know stay
[6:38] away know Jesus knew where he was
[6:41] standing and when he saw them he said
[6:43] unto them go show yourselves unto the
[6:46] priest now you see how the word tells
[6:49] them to go obey the word that that in
[6:52] that that law out there is in Leviticus
[6:55] that when that when you thought that you
[6:58] were cleansed of leprosy you were to go
[7:01] show up believers living 13 if I'm not
[7:03] mistaken you were to go show and present
[7:06] yourself to the priest because the
[7:08] priest or the high priest was kind of
[7:10] like a doctor as well because he would
[7:14] go and he is somebody says the cow was a
[7:16] leper looks like I've been clean
[7:18] cleansed Duluth the priest had to go he
[7:21] had to be examined that the leper had to
[7:24] be examined thoroughly before he could
[7:26] before the priest could actually say
[7:29] you're okay you're bonafide clean go
[7:32] back to your family go back into society
[7:35] and it was the priest that decided that
[7:37] so Jesus didn't even pray for them Jesus
[7:40] didn't even say that you've been healed
[7:44] he just told him go away the word say go
[7:48] go do what the word says go show
[7:50] yourselves unto the priest and they came
[7:53] to pass that as they went now I like
[7:58] that because you see they took Jesus's
[8:00] word and then okay Jesus you told us to
[8:04] go and see the priest in faith we're
[8:07] gonna do it so they kept they kept
[8:09] walking and they were going to the
[8:11] priest they and as they went as they
[8:15] were exercising their faith and what
[8:17] Jesus told to go do to go obey the word
[8:20] they were cleanse praise the Lord
[8:24] amen so it's in new exercise in the it
[8:28] isn't that didn't have to be like
[8:30] somebody laid hands on you it didn't
[8:33] have to be that somebody that somebody
[8:34] just prayed a incredible prayer just
[8:37] shook you and all kinds of stuff that's
[8:40] wonderful it's great but when you take
[8:43] God at His Word he appreciates that more
[8:47] than anything else and you believe that
[8:49] word and you take action on that word I
[8:53] mean that's powerful that's living by
[8:56] faith and that's what living by faith is
[8:59] it's not something SuperDuper that we
[9:02] sometimes think that it's ripping the
[9:04] shirt off and there's a Superman logo
[9:06] you know do you know but it's it's just
[9:10] Lord you've said it I believe it that
[9:12] settles it I'm taking your word and
[9:16] sister do you think that Jesus the faith
[9:21] that he had because he was God I mean he
[9:24] must have prayed for those people well I
[9:27] mean he I'm sure that human element of
[9:30] him haven't haven't had to do that as
[9:33] well because I mean he was human you say
[9:36] and so I'm sure that he had to have to
[9:39] remember he was he had all God in him so
[9:44] now there is an example where a brother
[9:49] from South Carolina he's passed away now
[9:51] and do you all remember the story of the
[9:56] but the Studebaker car brother Gerald
[10:02] Cleveland who was living in South
[10:04] Carolina and he had a he had a he had a
[10:06] car who back he went to one brother
[10:12] branham's meetings and the brakes
[10:14] completely went out from the car that
[10:17] brother brother George Smith wrote about
[10:19] this story back in like the 90s and in
[10:21] that only believe magazine and in that
[10:24] in that story where the Cleveland tells
[10:27] us because I heard him tell us he says
[10:29] that at some point just to make the long
[10:32] story short at some point he asks
[10:34] brother branham he said brother Brown
[10:36] can you can you go ahead and pray for us
[10:39] we need to go drive back to South
[10:41] Carolina and we need to cross through
[10:43] the mountains and all that and we have a
[10:44] sick sister that we need to carry back
[10:46] she was sick and it was brother Baxter's
[10:49] of wives mom brother sister Smith that's
[10:54] right she was sick and yeah and so and
[11:00] so brother brother Cleveland said that
[11:02] it was right after they had gotten out
[11:03] from the Blue Boar restaurant it was one
[11:05] of the restaurants where they normally
[11:06] would were to eat at and brother branham
[11:09] he said that brother branham is his
[11:11] brother of Cleveland's onward brother
[11:13] branham oh he didn't even pray for the
[11:16] vehicle he just said he just kind of
[11:18] looked he just kind of looked at it it
[11:20] kind of looked at him and he said
[11:21] brother Cleveland you just go now now
[11:26] you take that for exactly and and and
[11:28] the the car and when they were driving
[11:30] down through the mountains yeah the
[11:35] mechanic Brown took us
[11:37] it was a Sunday there was no mechanics
[11:39] opened anywhere so they said if you just
[11:41] keep putting brake fluid in the car it
[11:43] should get you going all the way to
[11:45] South Carolina but you're gonna have to
[11:46] keep refilling and as they were driving
[11:48] they never had to put that he hit the
[11:51] banisters dad brother sister banisters
[11:54] mom dad said brother Cleveland cuz he
[11:57] would say he said he would drive you and
[11:59] accelerate it and then he hit the brake
[12:01] there are and then he'll accelerate
[12:04] again and he hit the brake and they
[12:05] almost he's my brother Cleveland this
[12:08] thing looks like he's got new brakes he
[12:09] said I believe it they were able to get
[12:15] and sister Smith was healed too yeah
[12:18] now at that point both brother Brown had
[12:22] already preached the seals and it was up
[12:24] believe was 1964 that was around the
[12:26] time when he preached the future home
[12:30] and I think that's where they that's
[12:32] what yeah or he was about to but you
[12:35] know at some point at that time you know
[12:37] brother Brennan I believe was was
[12:38] adopted you know full adoption yeah I
[12:42] intake you know you take Jesus Christ
[12:45] fullness of God dwelled in him where he
[12:47] didn't even have to even pray he didn't
[12:49] have to and was God and probably maybe
[12:52] the Lord even showed him that they
[12:54] weren't gonna be healed you know he was
[12:56] God so giving that example but anyway so
[13:01] they go and the Bible says that they
[13:05] were planners now one of them when he
[13:08] saw that he was healed turned back and
[13:12] with a loud voice glorified God now he's
[13:15] using that same voice that he was trying
[13:17] to warn people and he was trying to try
[13:20] to get people to help him you know now
[13:24] he's using that same voice to glorify to
[13:26] glorify God and he fell down on his face
[13:28] verse 16 he fell on his face at his feet
[13:30] giving him thanks and and you know if
[13:37] you take a look you know he fell down on
[13:39] his face and he's probably wondering
[13:41] he's probably thinking you know what I'm
[13:43] not only just healed but now I'm gonna
[13:46] be restored back to society
[13:49] I'm gonna reuse my probably I'm gonna
[13:50] have my job back I'm gonna be all these
[13:54] wonderful things are probably going
[13:55] through my family yeah would be with his
[13:57] family and everything like that I mean
[13:59] his whole life was about to change so he
[14:02] had a lot to be thankful for now even
[14:06] though he was the only one who came back
[14:09] to thank God the other ones still kept
[14:13] their healing you see it wasn't like
[14:16] their healing was gone because they
[14:17] didn't come back to thank God so if we
[14:20] keep reading here he says any fellows
[14:22] feet given him Jesus thanks and look how
[14:26] the Bible makes it clear it makes it and
[14:29] he was a Samaritan now that you know the
[14:33] Bible doesn't put things in there just
[14:35] to put him there and he was a Samaritan
[14:37] you want to look and if he wanted to
[14:40] it's like God letting us know okay
[14:42] here's Jesus he came to his own the Jews
[14:46] his own received him not his his own
[14:50] people didn't even want to listen to
[14:52] what Jesus had to say yeah the Samaritan
[14:54] came back to thank God to thank Jesus
[14:57] and Jesus answering said we're not ten
[15:02] cleansed but where are the nine there
[15:07] are not found that returned to give
[15:08] glory to God say this stranger now you
[15:10] see he wasn't even talking to that to
[15:13] that man because I mean he's referring
[15:15] to him as this stranger so he wasn't
[15:18] talking to him directly
[15:20] he was talking to the people around him
[15:22] they must have because I mean if I'm
[15:25] talking to sister Peggy I'm not
[15:26] referring to hers
[15:28] you know that's this stranger as this
[15:31] woman we're gonna have Thanksgiving
[15:32] dinner today
[15:34] no no wait sister Peggy we're having
[15:37] Thanksgiving do you know it's a port
[15:38] more personal so he was talking to
[15:40] probably the people around him they were
[15:41] listening to him at the moment because
[15:44] then he turns and he says he says and
[15:47] Jesus answering said we're not ten
[15:49] cleansed but where are they where are
[15:50] their other none there are not found
[15:51] that returned to give glory to God save
[15:53] this stranger
[15:54] and they said unto Him see now he turns
[15:57] to him and says unto Him arise go that
[16:00] way thy faith hath made me hold now I
[16:02] thought he was already healed that's a
[16:10] totally different then when you look
[16:12] when you look at this at that word at
[16:13] that word hole right there
[16:16] that's the that's the word so so and it
[16:22] it means it means to save keep save
[16:25] sound to rescue from danger instruction
[16:28] to save a suffering from disease to make
[16:33] well heal restore the help to preserve
[16:34] one who is in danger to save in the
[16:38] technical biblical sense negative to
[16:40] deliver from the penalties of the
[16:42] Messianic judgment to say from the evils
[16:44] which obstruct the reception's of me
[16:46] in other words from from sin you see it
[16:52] wasn't it he got an even his heart Jesus
[16:57] knew his heart that he was coming back
[16:59] you know as in a repent of way you know
[17:02] that thankfulness was a repent of
[17:04] thankfulness it was totally different
[17:07] than just being healed and this and if
[17:10] you look in Romans I have it here in
[17:12] Romans chapter Romans chapter 10 and I
[17:17] believe it's C
[17:24] think is verse 9 right here where it
[17:28] says it that thou shalt confess with thy
[17:29] mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe
[17:31] in thine heart that God hath raised him
[17:34] from the dead thou shalt be saved no see
[17:38] that's the same word Sozo so it's it's a
[17:44] totally different totally different that
[17:46] that man came back and because of his
[17:49] heart see God knows the heart God knows
[17:51] the reason why you're doing - Oh Thomas
[17:53] it's ok to say thanks it's ours it was
[17:56] wonderful thank you Lord and praise God
[17:58] but then now there's a different
[18:01] thankfulness that really comes from a
[18:02] long chain that actually changes you
[18:06] from the inside out and God knows that
[18:10] amen so so go back here so it's
[18:19] interesting that uh that he came back
[18:25] and he would Jesus told him he said go
[18:27] that way that faith hath made made me
[18:29] hope it was an exact same thing that he
[18:31] told the lady that was had the blood
[18:34] issues for many years he said thy faith
[18:38] hath made you whole you know night you
[18:41] were healed all right but now you know
[18:44] that faith hath made you whole now of
[18:47] course there was no Holy Spirit at the
[18:49] time the Holy Ghost hadn't come Jesus
[18:51] had not died but there was a salvation
[18:53] for them at the time at the most that
[18:56] they could believe at you know but and
[18:59] that's that's to me that's more
[19:01] important than that if we can brother
[19:04] Brian always said you know you can be
[19:05] healed and you're gonna eventually get
[19:07] sick again right and that's why Brad
[19:11] Grant said you can't major on a minor
[19:14] and say you can't major on miracles or
[19:17] healings you can't you can't that you
[19:20] have to major on what's what it is the
[19:23] major and that's the salvation and the
[19:25] healing of the salt because that's
[19:27] eternal you see and so uh so I just
[19:32] wanted to point that out you know that
[19:34] scripture and here's some up here's some
[19:35] few other scriptures in Ephesians
[19:38] chapter 5 verse 18 it says and be not
[19:46] drunk with wine wherein is excess
[19:47] they'll be filled with the spirit they
[19:49] feel with the spirit speaking to
[19:51] yourselves in Psalms and hymns and
[19:53] spiritual songs singing and making
[19:55] melody in your heart to the Lord giving
[19:57] thanks always for all things unto God
[20:02] and the Father in the name of our Lord
[20:04] Jesus Christ
[20:05] in Colossians chapter 3 options chapter
[20:10] 3 verse 15 through 17 and let the peace
[20:13] of God rule in your hearts to the which
[20:15] also ye are called in one body and being
[20:18] he thankful but the word of Christ dwell
[20:22] in you richly in all wisdom teaching and
[20:24] admonishing one another in Psalms and
[20:26] hymns and spiritual songs singing with
[20:29] grace in your hearts to the Lord and
[20:31] whatsoever you do in word or deed do all
[20:34] in the name of the Lord Jesus giving
[20:36] thanks to God and the Father by him add
[20:41] that that Thanksgiving it entered into
[20:44] that as well no I'll end with this
[20:51] around says here we are your people we
[20:55] are not under any bondage we are free
[20:57] the son has made us free and we are free

[21:28] Son of God is not dead but he's a lot
[21:30] amongst us tonight proving himself alive

[21:35] out the Holy Ghost upon his church in
[21:37] the last days just before his appearing
