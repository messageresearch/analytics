[0:01] brother how prom much will you ask the
[0:03] Lord's blessing baptism
[0:06] Church bless dear father thankful this
[0:09] afternoon for this Gathering here this
[0:12] special occasion people Lord pray God
[0:15] that word of God will take hope into
[0:17] their hearts grow multiply might be a
[0:22] blessing father pray Lord that you bless
[0:24] each and every
[0:28] one this
[0:31] pray that you guide each one of us and
[0:33] let us be encouragement unto them Father
[0:36] as they
[0:48] ende we have three already so if anybody
[0:51] else decides while we're at it be glad
[0:54] to baptize anybody else I always like to
[0:56] read the scripture in in
[0:58] Romans to kind of
[1:01] express the
[1:03] things
[1:05] and you know where we
[1:07] can put it into the scriptural
[1:12] part never nobody should have any
[1:14] problems about what we the way we do
[1:16] because we're going be baptize to
[1:19] fulfill you hear me say to fulfill what
[1:21] the Lord Jesus said to baptize in the
[1:23] name of the father and of the son and of
[1:25] the Holy Ghost the only way you can do
[1:26] that is baptize in the name of the Lord
[1:28] Jesus Christ but father son and Holy
[1:30] Ghost is not a name that's right that's
[1:32] just title so then it's Lord Jesus
[1:35] Christ see that is father son Holy Ghost
[1:37] so it'll fulfill I like to read what
[1:39] Paul said in Romans here Romans 6 what
[1:42] shall we say then shall we continue in
[1:45] sin that Grace May abound God forbid how
[1:48] shall we that are dead to sin live any
[1:50] longer therein now that's what your
[1:52] baptism means you're dying at a water
[1:55] grave and you're coming back up to walk
[1:57] in newness of Life That's what example
[2:00] as far right know you not that so many
[2:03] of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ
[2:05] were baptized into his death therefore
[2:08] we are buried with him by baptism into
[2:11] death that like as Christ was raised up
[2:14] from the dead by the glory of the father
[2:16] even so we also should walk in newness
[2:19] of life for if we have been planted
[2:21] together in the likeness of his death we
[2:24] shall be also in the likeness of his
[2:27] resurrection knowing this that our old
[2:29] man is crucified with him that the body
[2:31] of sin might be destroyed that
[2:33] henceforth we should not serve sin for
[2:36] he that is dead is free from sin see
[2:38] that's what it means you're going to die
[2:39] to yourself and be raised to walk in
[2:42] newness now if we be dead with Christ we
[2:45] believe that we shall also live with him
[2:48] knowing that Christ being raised from
[2:49] the dead dies No More Death ha no more
[2:52] dominion over him for in that he died he
[2:55] died under sin once but in that he
[2:57] liveth he liveth under God now watch
[3:00] likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be
[3:03] dead indeed un sin but but alive unto
[3:07] God through Jesus Christ Our Lord amen
[3:11] that's what our what
[3:13] our examples are for baptism don't save
[3:17] you it's an answer of a good conscience
[3:20] in other words you're doing what God
[3:21] Said So we let the little girl come
[3:23] first then she's number one we got a
[3:26] little little Nala wants to be baptized

[8:46] Father I baptized a lot of people over
[8:49] that were baptized before the only thing
[8:51] that I've ever made a stipulation to
[8:53] anybody there A lot of times and I had
[8:55] to
[8:57] baptize if you were in a n inational
[9:00] church that baptized under
[9:01] regeneration which a lot of the the
[9:04] Jesus name people they did do that and
[9:06] they would baptize under regeneration in
[9:08] other words believing that your baptism
[9:10] was your regeneration and I've always
[9:13] encouraged people even though they were
[9:14] baptized correctly to go and get make
[9:17] sure you're baptized CU you don't want
[9:19] it to be under
[9:20] regeneration you want it to be under the
