[8:03] praise God
[8:06] praise God
[8:09] praise God
[8:14] and when we've
[8:17] been there
[8:21] think about that
[8:22] [Music]
[8:36] we all have no
[8:41] think about that
[8:44] [Music]
[8:46] God's grace
[8:48] [Music]
[9:00] we can't fathom that can we because
[9:01] we're already thinking about going to
[9:03] work tomorrow
[9:04] gotta get up got awesome chicken
[9:07] tonight
[9:11] but not when that day happens nope
[9:14] brother Hal Thomas is not worried about
[9:16] what's going to happen tomorrow there is
[9:18] no tomorrow over there
[9:20] all there is is is I believe that you
[9:23] know brother Brown said that he would
[9:25] he'd send somebody down to the river
[9:28] to help you over because you've never
[9:30] been there you've never done that before
[9:31] you you a little bit you got a little
[9:33] bit tense maybe uh Crossing from this
[9:36] this world into the next World and we
[9:39] don't know that we don't know how that
[9:40] works but we had a prophet that went
[9:42] across and told us he said somebody'll
[9:44] come meet you at the river
[9:46] that you know
[9:48] make you comfortable it's comfortable to
[9:50] know when you somebody you're in trouble
[9:51] and somebody comes to help you that that
[9:53] they get you know
[9:54] I mean strangers help you that's okay
[9:56] but if you get somebody show up that you
[9:58] know it's way more comforting
[10:02] way more comforting somebody that you
[10:05] know will come meet you to try to get
[10:08] you through that get you across that
[10:09] River over into the other dimension but
[10:12] that's that's what I believe that that
[10:14] brother Howe Thomas did last Sunday
[10:16] afternoon
[10:17] somebody helped him across
[10:20] and Ain't No Going Back across that
[10:21] River either ain't no coming back this
[10:23] way
[10:24] uh
[10:26] we're going Saints you're going to come
[10:27] over here but it's not going to be
[10:28] because we're going to die
[10:32] we might have to die to ourselves but
[10:34] it's not because we're going to die
[10:36] physically and then all of a sudden
[10:37] there's something just going to happen
[10:38] no there'll be somebody that will stay
[10:40] here
[10:42] we which are alive and remain
[10:45] shall not prevent or hinder those who
[10:48] are asleep
[10:49] amen you love the Lord good to be back

[14:16] amen
[14:18] in the beginning was the word the word
[14:20] was with God and the Word was God now
[14:22] this word we're going to talk about in
[14:24] just a second this word is this when we
[14:26] say the word of God
[14:29] bless you when we say don't do that
[14:31] again
[14:34] in about 30 minutes
[14:36] no if you do that without heart attacks
[14:38] on the building no it's okay I'm gonna
[14:40] get one of those horns and go why
[14:42] she just did it for me
[14:44] what's your face red for
[14:48] anyway
[14:50] this word that we're talking about here
[14:52] it's a person
[14:55] all right it's a person everybody with
[14:57] me with that this is not just words on a
[14:59] page black and white
[15:01] all right this is a person
[15:04] the word was made flesh all right and
[15:08] was it imperfect
[15:10] nope it was not imperfect it was a
[15:12] perfect word that was made flesh and
[15:16] that perfect word that was inside that
[15:17] flesh now I didn't say the flesh was
[15:19] perfect
[15:20] all right not yet but what was inside
[15:23] that flesh was perfect and it spoke what
[15:26] perfect word
[15:28] it spoke perfect word
[15:30] everybody with me because we're going to
[15:31] get to that in just a minute and the
[15:33] Word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[15:35] and we beheld his glory the glory the
[15:38] only begotten of the father full of
[15:40] grace and truth you can be seated Lord
[15:42] as blessing of the reading of the word I
[15:43] want you to really listen to that do you
[15:45] believe that Jesus Christ was the word
[15:47] of God Amen we believe that that word
[15:51] was a perfect word yes and we believe he
[15:54] spoke that word 2 000 years ago he spoke
[15:57] that very word that's going to redeem us
[16:00] heal us all the all the Redemptive plan
[16:02] everything's going on was in that three
[16:05] and a half year Ministry of Jesus Christ
[16:06] never was that he had to say oh I'm
[16:08] sorry I said that I didn't mean that I
[16:10] meant this
[16:12] so it was plainly written in the Bible
[16:14] but as being black and white letters
[16:16] it's going to lay there we're going to
[16:19] read it but we're going to have to take
[16:20] that off that page and put it into flesh
[16:23] now that's exactly what God did from the
[16:25] Old Testament
[16:27] come on
[16:28] he took the Torah
[16:30] what he told Moses Moses Moses described
[16:34] it wrote it Isaiah Jeremiah they all
[16:38] wrote it and put it in Scrolls right
[16:39] natural Scrolls
[16:41] now when they unscrolled out and read it
[16:44] in in the in the the time of Caiaphas
[16:46] and different ones about the time of
[16:48] Jesus it was what they had read for
[16:50] years and years and years
[16:52] but it really didn't do anything
[16:56] oh yeah it helped them
[16:58] but it become a ritual
[17:00] right God even says it's a stink in my
[17:02] nostrils all these sacrifices and
[17:04] everything you do and just you know
[17:05] frivolously
[17:06] but one day whatever they were reading
[17:11] was born
[17:15] birthed into this world by the word that
[17:19] was spoken
[17:21] it became flesh and then it was not
[17:24] silent of course you know we always
[17:26] called the 29 years of Jesus's life was
[17:28] the silent years because it really
[17:30] wasn't nothing much written but my when
[17:32] he started speaking
[17:34] it only took him three and a half years
[17:36] to give us all the sermons all the
[17:38] religion the religion that we have
[17:40] in that three and a half year message
[17:41] and then then God depended on listen to
[17:45] this God depended on four men
[17:51] to write it down
[17:52] put it right back on paper again
[17:57] some men will take it off
[18:00] some men will leave it on I say man I
[18:03] say
[18:04] preachers
[18:06] you me
[18:08] are we reading dead letter
[18:11] I thought that word was made flesh in
[18:13] you
[18:15] so whatever was written by Matthew
[18:16] Martin Luke and John and all the other
[18:19] prophets in the New Testament
[18:21] it's laying there just like it was in
[18:23] the Old Testament
[18:25] what are we going to do about it it's
[18:28] got to come off of those pages again and
[18:30] be not born as a baby but born inside of
[18:33] you by the new birth everybody with me
[18:36] that's why the new birth is so important
[18:37] it's why you can't understand this guy
[18:39] this guy this man this person this Jesus
[18:42] Christ he was speaking by what by the
[18:44] Holy Ghost not by person not by an
[18:46] individual person Jesus was an
[18:48] individual person but he was God
[18:51] there wasn't any room for the devil
[18:54] there except in his flesh he kept
[18:56] pounding on his flesh all the time but
[18:58] he couldn't get to that man that was
[19:00] inside and when that man would speak he
[19:02] spoke from what from what was inside of
[19:04] him
[19:05] but he spoke from exactly he said I only
[19:09] say that what
[19:10] what the father gives me that's what I
[19:13] say
[19:15] if we could just preach like that
[19:18] if we could just preach what the father
[19:20] gives us
[19:22] you'd be received some good some bad
[19:26] because remember he wasn't very popular
[19:28] when he spoke what the father said
[19:32] amen
[19:33] it's my brother Branham when he started
[19:35] preaching what the father told him to
[19:37] preach he wasn't very popular
[19:39] man
[19:40] all right you won't be either
[19:43] John 3 verse 3 says Jesus answered and
[19:46] said now this is the word speaking
[19:48] I say unto you except the man be born
[19:50] again he cannot see the kingdom of God
[19:52] he's compelling you to enter into a
[19:55] place that he's in to understand who he
[19:58] is all right because nobody understood
[20:00] listen No One during that three and a
[20:03] half year Ministry of Jesus listen even
[20:04] when he was 13 his mother and father
[20:06] didn't really know who he was because
[20:08] his mother denied him your father your
[20:10] father and I are sinking after you she
[20:13] said me and Joseph brother Brown said
[20:15] she denied the Virgin birth
[20:17] and she was the very one that did it
[20:20] she was an active participant of that
[20:23] and still
[20:25] brother Brown said let down the bar
[20:27] by her Humanity
[20:29] but she didn't understand who he was not
[20:31] not directly
[20:34] do we
[20:36] is that word being made flesh and me and
[20:38] you
[20:41] now here's the word himself again
[20:44] speaking John is writing the commentary
[20:47] he hears what Jesus said he's putting it
[20:50] on a piece of paper that Jesus says I
[20:52] have yet things to say to you but cannot
[20:54] bear you can't bear them now in other
[20:55] words what you don't have the Holy Ghost
[20:57] you're not going to understand me they
[20:58] didn't understand it much anyway
[21:00] he said how be it when he the person the
[21:05] spirit of Truth has come he will guide
[21:07] you into some truth
[21:09] Lord I need to make that bigger
[21:12] it says all
[21:16] I can't stand when people even nowadays
[21:18] they say well well we can't all be
[21:20] perfect we can't all be right you know
[21:22] we can't all have this I mean you can't
[21:23] yeah you can
[21:26] yes you can if you'll get yourself out
[21:29] of the way and let the father start
[21:32] speaking he will not
[21:35] preach error
[21:37] God cannot there is no error anywhere in
[21:40] his person
[21:42] he don't even know where
[21:44] he knows of it he knows people are in
[21:46] error but he's not in error so why can't
[21:49] we get into him
[21:51] look at the Apostle Paul Apostle Paul
[21:53] was close
[21:55] he had the mind of God to write 80
[21:57] percent of the of the New Testament
[21:58] putting it in paper and pen
[22:02] so that you and I
[22:05] well I mean it's even an eternal word of
[22:07] God none of that's going to go away
[22:09] the Bible's not going to go away it's
[22:12] going to be lived like it's supposed to
[22:14] have been
[22:15] but when he the spirit of Truth has come
[22:17] he will guide you into all Truth for he
[22:18] shall not speak of himself like it was
[22:20] talking about last Sunday he's not going
[22:22] to speak of himself he now is saying
[22:24] bride bride bride you got to get it
[22:27] you're going to get it through the bride
[22:32] she is him
[22:35] we had to have a Prophet come and tell
[22:37] us
[22:37] she is him
[22:40] the scripture that speaks of the
[22:42] bridegroom
[22:43] also speaks of the Bride yes
[22:46] we had to have a problem to tell us that
[22:48] because Wesley didn't Luther didn't
[22:53] thank you Calvin Penny they never said
[22:56] that
[22:57] they never said now I call you Brian
[22:59] either
[23:02] I mean they understood that believe on
[23:04] the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be
[23:05] saved live a good Christian Life right
[23:08] but to going up into the spirit of God
[23:10] to where you can walk in pure truth and
[23:14] not have error it wasn't for them
[23:17] we'll get to that in just a minute
[23:20] but look
[23:21] but whatsoever
[23:23] he shall hear
[23:26] that shall he speak the bride The Voice
[23:29] the final voice and the final age is in
[23:32] the bride sure it's Jesus Christ sure
[23:34] it's our husband sure is our bride groom
[23:38] but he's speaking to us he decided that
[23:41] yes we didn't we didn't make that up we
[23:45] couldn't
[23:47] it had to come from somebody that knew
[23:49] what he was talking about that I'm going
[23:50] to have a bride a gentile bride in the
[23:53] end time that's going to take the words
[23:54] off of that page and gonna make them
[23:56] live yes foreign
[24:00] [Applause]
[24:03] and he will show you things to come
[24:05] listen
[24:07] brother Brown said he said what there's
[24:09] no more prevailing power than a
[24:11] revelation why because it has to come
[24:14] from God Satan will not give you a
[24:16] revelation he might give you part truth
[24:20] listen the greatest lie ever told 99
[24:22] true
[24:23] am I right
[24:25] you shall not surely die one word
[24:30] God said You shall surely die if you eat
[24:32] of that tree Satan said You shall not
[24:34] surely surely die oh my come on one word
[24:39] off
[24:41] Revelation 19 6 and I heard his word the
[24:43] voice of a great multitude listen
[24:46] I love the Bible because the Bible to me
[24:49] let me see if I can get this right like
[24:51] I was thinking about the Bible
[24:54] sure brother Ram said it you know it's
[24:55] multi-layered
[24:57] it's to the bride
[24:58] to the center but it's written to
[25:00] Christians all right bottom line the
[25:03] Bible's written a Christian okay so it's
[25:06] for us to hear and to see but it also
[25:08] looks it says right here
[25:10] excuse me
[25:12] we're wondering in this time or in any
[25:15] other time if we're Worthy
[25:17] or if we're going to make it
[25:20] or if this is really true that we're
[25:23] going to be a mature group of people
[25:26] well God just waits till the very I'm
[25:28] gonna get to Genesis 1 because that's
[25:30] when he told us we were perfect
[25:33] 126 he told us we were perfect now he
[25:36] goes all the way to Revelations 19.
[25:39] and proves it
[25:44] he calls you his wife
[25:46] and you have made yourself ready
[25:53] that's what I was trying to say here we
[25:55] go all right I get it right
[25:56] what God does is he tells you who you
[25:58] are
[25:59] he tells you who you are tells you that
[26:01] he told Israel You're The Chosen
[26:04] your God you're mine I can't forget you
[26:06] I may have to divorce you
[26:09] but I'm gonna go way over here in
[26:11] Revelations what is it 7 or 11 and I'm
[26:14] gonna send you two Prophets
[26:18] a promise
[26:21] over him they didn't look like much of a
[26:23] promise
[26:25] we're divorced he's put us away
[26:28] we're not even his anymore
[26:30] go all the way over to Revelations when
[26:32] he sends those two prophets to get 144
[26:35] 000. then thank God he sends a prophet
[26:38] and tell hey there's going to be a fifth
[26:40] still Jew God's not going to forget you
[26:43] so what God does is he gives us our
[26:45] promises
[26:47] lets us go through trials and
[26:49] tribulations because remember the two
[26:51] books that Satan hates worse is what
[26:53] Genesis Revelations why in Genesis
[26:56] obviously it tells us in Genesis 1 26
[26:59] we're perfect
[27:01] we're God we're God's children
[27:05] we're supposed to subdue the Earth
[27:08] have dominion over it
[27:10] it don't look too good in between
[27:13] all right
[27:14] but we get over here on the other end of
[27:16] it
[27:17] let us be glad and rejoice
[27:20] and give honor to him for the marriage
[27:22] of the Lamb is coming his wife has made
[27:25] herself ready
[27:26] and to her was granted
[27:29] Genesis 1 26 it was granted but it had
[27:31] to be what it had to be put away for a
[27:33] little while so he could be savior
[27:36] healer Redeemer restorer there could be
[27:39] a Matthew Martin Luke and John there
[27:41] could be an Isaiah that could be all
[27:42] these different things and then pop up
[27:44] over here and say hey you're perfect
[27:48] that group that I was talking about over
[27:50] here you made yourself ready
[27:53] and to hurt was granted that she should
[27:54] be a raid and finally in and clean and
[27:55] white for the final Linen in his
[27:57] righteousness
[27:58] of saints
[28:01] brother Brown talks about and you must
[28:03] be born again we're talking about this
[28:05] morning you're still what you were until
[28:06] you're born again now we were talking
[28:08] about the soul this morning we'll talk a
[28:09] little bit more about it
[28:11] but you are who you are you're that's
[28:13] your soul your soul is who you are your
[28:16] soul listen brother around thank God for
[28:18] a prophet that told us he said look
[28:19] there's no there's no way that God can
[28:22] take your soul out and put it in
[28:24] somebody else
[28:28] I don't believe in pre-existence of
[28:30] Souls
[28:31] all right so what was Genesis 1 26 it
[28:34] was a pre-existence of souls but not
[28:35] individually from God away from God
[28:39] we weren't walking around with God
[28:41] we were walking around in his mind
[28:45] we were walking around in his mind in
[28:47] his thinking in the Eternal part
[28:50] and the Eternal part not the section of
[28:53] what he thought of but to Eternal part
[28:55] that's why brother Donnie that if we see
[28:58] Genesis 1 26 then Revelation is 19
[29:01] shouldn't be a surprise
[29:03] right
[29:09] so it doesn't change you all these other
[29:11] things the only thing that changes you
[29:12] is what
[29:13] in your soul
[29:16] by the burning of the word that's just
[29:19] plain it takes your nature nothing
[29:22] doesn't kill you now remember brother
[29:23] Graham said I don't believe in
[29:24] pre-existence all right so we weren't
[29:26] all oh you know people do it all you
[29:28] know you see people they go oh brother I
[29:30] just feel we was back there together
[29:33] oh yeah you gotta do that
[29:40] I'm not making fun but that ain't right
[29:42] if it ain't right it's wrong
[29:44] okay
[29:46] we were not back there shaking hands and
[29:48] walking around looking at each other
[29:50] brother what were we before we were
[29:53] nothing
[29:54] only in the mind of God were you
[29:59] something
[30:02] so no we weren't walking around because
[30:04] see that's the Mormon doctrine of
[30:05] pre-existence of souls real quick
[30:07] everybody understand or don't understand
[30:08] I'm fixing to give you a real quick
[30:11] but Mormons believe we're all walking
[30:13] around in heaven somewhere a long time
[30:15] ago whatever years and years
[30:18] and we were all just like this sitting
[30:20] around by me we were sitting around with
[30:22] robes and we were talking and in other
[30:24] words Satan got a group of people to
[30:26] believe this and Jesus got a group of
[30:28] people to believe this and and the
[30:30] father was in the middle and the father
[30:32] he wanted Jesus's plan was better than
[30:34] Satan's plan so Satan got mad took his
[30:37] people and went to Earth
[30:40] then what we got to do is we got to come
[30:42] down here and go into flesh and
[30:45] represent God and then go back to Heaven
[30:47] again that's really complicated to me
[30:50] okay
[30:52] we were nothing
[30:54] you have no memory of coming from the
[30:57] womb
[30:58] or before
[31:01] all right
[31:02] some of y'all may have good memories
[31:04] you did not remember the day you were
[31:06] born
[31:07] but I promise you you did remember the
[31:09] day your second birth happened
[31:12] you better remember that day your second
[31:14] birth happened
[31:18] the second one
[31:20] so brother random what were we we were
[31:22] nothing all right so he didn't believe
[31:24] in the Mormon Doctrine phrase this is
[31:25] the souls or transmigration do you ever
[31:27] you know what transmigration is it's
[31:29] like God God's not really happy with me
[31:32] being in this one
[31:34] so he's gonna me and Michael gonna swap
[31:39] me either buddy
[31:43] maybe our age but
[31:47] so there's so all right point is when
[31:51] you're born a baby
[31:52] God breathes into your nostrils
[31:54] the Breath of Life
[31:57] then you become a living soul
[31:59] that Soul stays with you
[32:02] it is inside of you
[32:05] for your whole lifetime
[32:07] and Beyond
[32:10] well I feel I got this
[32:12] you better only feel one thing
[32:15] that your soul has been changed by the
[32:17] new birth that your soul has been burnt
[32:20] out amen not killed
[32:22] because if you can't God if God kills
[32:24] your soul your dad
[32:27] then you would come up another person
[32:29] we're not that way no let's keep it
[32:31] straight
[32:33] your soul when you were born to make a
[32:35] what a choice yes whatever your choice
[32:39] is that's what continues with you
[32:41] through your life till you come to the
[32:42] day that you pass away and when you pass
[32:44] away that Soul goes somewhere
[32:47] it's not drifting around it's not laying
[32:50] in the grave it's some some
[32:51] denominations believe called Soul
[32:53] sleeping that when you die you just lay
[32:55] in the grave and there your soul lays
[32:57] just dormant like you know like God did
[32:58] the last witch
[33:00] he light switches on when he was a born
[33:02] baby and then when you die the light
[33:03] switch goes off and everything stays in
[33:05] the grave I don't believe that one
[33:07] either I don't even like that one
[33:10] who would like that to be your religion
[33:13] I'm I'm claustrophobic
[33:20] I don't want to get woke up right in the
[33:22] middle of six foot and under
[33:24] we think it's silly but these people
[33:26] base their adoptions on that
[33:28] that's how Satan is in a port Getting In
[33:31] a Pulpit
[33:32] he's so tantalizing like the one says
[33:34] well
[33:36] anything contrary to the word of God the
[33:38] devil is the one that conjured up all
[33:41] right anything all this that we're
[33:43] talking about anything that's been
[33:45] besides the word of God that's been
[33:47] thought of
[33:48] is of the devil
[33:52] nice thinking this more this afternoon
[33:56] you know we we talk about casting out
[33:58] devils
[33:59] all right we'll get back to our subject
[34:01] maybe I'll tell you this before I forget
[34:03] it
[34:05] we talk about casting out Devils right
[34:08] say you have a devil devil on you for
[34:10] sleeping
[34:12] tell you
[34:18] I told him I was going to come back here
[34:21] but you know we cast out Devils we speak
[34:23] we we pray over them and if you gotta
[34:25] say whatever all right XYZ
[34:28] um
[34:30] brother Brown talks about epilepsy a lot
[34:32] he tells you to close your eyes I mean
[34:34] he's so serious about that he said that
[34:35] demon is so wants to get into something
[34:37] he said you better not lift your eyes up
[34:41] when that thing gets cast out
[34:43] but you know what
[34:46] think about this
[34:48] those are all lesser demons
[34:53] when you get to New Birth
[34:58] it ain't a lesser demon that goes out of
[35:00] you
[35:05] it's the Devil Himself
[35:10] it's the Devil Himself it's not a it's
[35:11] not a secondary demon or a little imp or
[35:14] something or no it's the real man
[35:16] himself the devil
[35:18] keep his eyes in your soul
[35:21] brother Brown said face her doubt right
[35:24] there's only two powers
[35:28] so when you get the new birth
[35:30] that's why it's so important
[35:33] you can be you can be haunted by other
[35:37] smaller demons
[35:38] but the devil is the one you want out of
[35:40] your soul
[35:42] everybody with me on that so when you
[35:44] get the new birth the head honcho leaves
[35:47] you
[35:49] the one that gives you all I mean he's
[35:51] going to still trouble you but he will
[35:53] not be able to take your soul and tell
[35:56] you the hell
[35:57] no way
[35:59] God's grabbed that thing and he's got it
[36:01] he's got it just like this right here
[36:02] and listen what God
[36:05] puts in his hand remember he said I'll
[36:08] not lose one
[36:11] I'll not lose one but now the devil just
[36:13] soon you'll be lost the rest of your
[36:15] life
[36:16] right so think about that then you burnt
[36:19] that's what it is it's going you're
[36:20] going straight to the head honcho both
[36:22] of them all right you're going straight
[36:24] to the head two demons I mean the demon
[36:27] in God you're going two people
[36:29] now buy with me
[36:35] because Antichrist spirit will come into
[36:38] the church to file it make it lukewarm
[36:39] formal and Powerless I want to ask you a
[36:42] question today has you done that to you
[36:45] he's not worried about these walls
[36:47] anymore
[36:48] he's worried about your church
[36:50] your Tabernacle
[36:53] make it lukewarm formal
[36:56] powerless it's a pulpits where it
[36:57] started no wonder it's a damnation of
[37:00] the country when Satan got into Pulpit
[37:02] it's the truth failing the preached
[37:04] unadulterated word of God
[37:06] and the word of God look will produce
[37:07] exactly what he said it would do it's
[37:09] what I said if it's on the page
[37:11] it's got to come off the page but when
[37:13] it comes off that page when that Bible
[37:16] when that word of God comes off that
[37:18] page it's got to produce Jesus Christ
[37:21] it can't produce nothing else but Jesus
[37:24] Christ
[37:28] we try to explain it all the way
[37:30] then we come to the first seal and we
[37:32] see that God through the prophet he's in
[37:34] the first seal he's getting ready to
[37:35] break the seal getting ready to break
[37:37] all the seals
[37:39] says look broken to whom not Christ but
[37:42] to the church
[37:43] and then I believe he conscious he
[37:45] pauses a minute notice now oh oh my
[37:48] that just makes me tremble
[37:50] I I hope that you
[37:53] the church truly understands see what I
[37:55] mean
[37:57] you people
[37:58] then he catches it he said now I'm going
[38:00] to call you bride
[38:02] that you'll understand
[38:04] that you'll be able to separate Church
[38:08] from bride
[38:09] foolish virgin
[38:11] from bride
[38:13] all right listen so there's our
[38:15] formidable opponent now look that
[38:17] opponent's been driven out of your soul
[38:18] by the new birth but he is an opponent
[38:21] he's still going to fight
[38:23] he's going to fight you in your spirit
[38:25] Realm
[38:26] the rest of your life but we have
[38:29] Satan's answer
[38:32] because brother Brown says look there's
[38:33] been bride churches churches Brides
[38:35] churches Brides brides but there's got
[38:37] to come one there's one that's going to
[38:40] be the perfect Church in the end time I
[38:44] don't mean perfect church building I
[38:45] mean The Perfect Bride everybody with me
[38:48] there has to come a real bride not that
[38:50] they're false but they're real bride in
[38:53] other words they're dressed exactly
[38:55] correct The Headstone is able to come
[38:57] down and not be offset turn to one side
[39:02] fit straight on it
[39:05] listen you better start believing that
[39:08] because that's our requirement in this
[39:09] age
[39:11] come to until we come to that place
[39:13] until we find that place was it good
[39:15] dude to polish the hubs
[39:17] all right let's go right here I wonder
[39:18] Ephesians 4 grieve not the holy spirit
[39:21] of God will buy you our sealed until the
[39:22] day of redemption
[39:24] that's what we do all the time
[39:27] we do we grieve him
[39:29] look he says let all bitterness and
[39:31] wrath as well the Bible was talking
[39:32] about this morning bitterness wrath
[39:34] anger clamor evil speaking be put away
[39:36] from you with all malice in other words
[39:37] that's what'll make him go into on the
[39:39] limb out there all right but you can't
[39:42] one to another tender hearty forgiving
[39:43] one another even as God for Christ's
[39:45] sake has forgiven you
[39:47] but that's in the enemy Gates the holy
[39:49] spirit is timid
[39:50] just real timid just any little
[39:53] Interruption bothers him
[39:55] I pulled up some quotes a few minutes
[39:57] ago and there was so many I couldn't
[39:58] bring them I just put in sit still
[40:02] brother Branham said sit still
[40:05] stop moving around
[40:07] everybody's wanting to move and
[40:09] everybody's wanting to do all the he
[40:11] said sit still
[40:12] what did I say on the backside of that
[40:14] column right there
[40:17] hmm
[40:20] didn't what brother Brown say when
[40:22] you've done all he to do he said what
[40:23] stand
[40:25] be still stand there Moses stand there
[40:29] and watch the glory of God
[40:31] now look Hebrews 4 12 this is I wanted
[40:33] to read this morning I forgot to put it
[40:35] in here now watch for the word of God
[40:37] now here we go back to what I just said
[40:39] about the word of God
[40:40] the word of God is perfect
[40:43] the word of God is complete the word of
[40:45] God does not have anything out of cater
[40:48] anything out of water it's eternal
[40:51] but remember down Through the Ages it
[40:54] got eroded Through Time by preachers
[40:56] saying the word of God is this
[40:59] trinitarian Doctrine the word of God is
[41:01] this
[41:02] different baptism the word of God is
[41:04] just believe in the Lord Jesus and thou
[41:06] shalt be saved thus in your birth
[41:09] amen
[41:10] that's not what the word says so we had
[41:13] to have a Prophet come in the end time
[41:14] with the perfect word of God to give us
[41:18] the Divine and perfect interpretation of
[41:21] the word of God so that we can look at
[41:23] Hebrews 4 12 and see where it comes from
[41:24] and what happens when it comes
[41:27] because when the word of God comes
[41:29] it's quick powerful sharper than
[41:33] two-edged sword piercing even to the
[41:35] dividing
[41:38] asunder of soul and Spirits so that was
[41:40] a prophet coming in time said hey your
[41:42] soul
[41:43] that's what's important
[41:45] hey he said hey that Soul that's the
[41:48] real you
[41:49] hey that soul is what God's working on
[41:52] today
[41:53] not Spirit Soul he divided and then he
[41:56] said you got a spirit there's memory
[41:58] reason conscious affects and Imagination
[42:03] Adam Johnson marrow
[42:05] proving to you that you're
[42:08] three different groups Body Spirit so
[42:12] all right and discerner of the thoughts
[42:15] and intents of the heart so let's look
[42:16] at the soul again let's put it in a
[42:18] little Genesis 1 26 here
[42:20] Genesis 1 26 is what that's the soul of
[42:24] God
[42:27] that's the soul of God
[42:30] everybody with me
[42:32] the way we're supposed to have come
[42:34] brother Michael we were supposed to have
[42:37] come like we're going to be
[42:41] am I missing anything
[42:42] we were supposed to come
[42:44] the way we're going to end up
[42:47] all right
[42:48] true
[42:50] Genesis 1 26 had there not been a fall
[42:53] we'd we would have all come here and
[42:56] given a body that body be made Eternal
[42:58] in a change
[43:00] okay everybody with me
[43:02] all right
[43:03] and then we would have had then God
[43:06] would have been not complete
[43:10] right
[43:11] he could have never healed anything
[43:12] because nothing there was the hill
[43:15] he surely couldn't redeem us because
[43:17] we're unredeemable if we're if we're God
[43:19] God didn't need Redemption
[43:21] we need Redemption
[43:24] that's why we got lost that's why they
[43:26] call it a fall
[43:28] we fell from this
[43:30] right
[43:32] and God knew that
[43:34] brother Brown said God knew when he put
[43:36] that in flesh it would fall
[43:39] all right
[43:40] but that was not the marring that was
[43:43] the marring of the Masterpiece but not
[43:44] the doing away with it it actually made
[43:46] the Masterpiece because then God could
[43:49] be I'm Gonna Save I'm gonna redeem I'm
[43:51] going to heal
[43:54] I'm gonna give you the desire of your
[43:57] heart
[43:57] you can move a mountain if you need it
[44:00] moved
[44:02] right
[44:05] so the salt these were all in God's mind
[44:08] we were there in that lump sum of of
[44:12] theophany
[44:15] God
[44:17] not a second person
[44:20] that's not a psychic person Genesis 1 26
[44:22] is not a second person of God
[44:24] it's an extension of the one God
[44:27] it's God in another form
[44:30] everybody with me all right so here's
[44:33] that soul but remember when when Adam
[44:36] and Eve did what they did when her womb
[44:39] natural was polluted it not it polluted
[44:41] her spiritual womb her womb right
[44:43] everybody with me
[44:45] so God God said I can't come that way
[44:49] now
[44:51] all right
[44:52] so I'm going to withhold brother around
[44:54] says the book
[44:56] what is that book is she it's you and me
[44:59] it's the family of God the Eternal
[45:02] section
[45:03] all right everybody with me that in that
[45:05] book
[45:06] that brother Brown said said that God
[45:08] had to take it back from Adam
[45:10] Adam was going to have the ability and
[45:13] then remember there's no words in here
[45:15] now because the Bible had been written
[45:17] but but your name is
[45:20] your name is in this book
[45:23] we know it's a Bible we know it's in
[45:25] God's mind but it wasn't written like
[45:26] this
[45:27] it was in the mind of God
[45:29] and he was handing it to Adam said hey
[45:39] that couldn't happen
[45:42] because the womb got polluted
[45:44] so brother Brown said God took the book
[45:47] back
[45:48] and he held on to it
[45:52] and all during this time he still got
[45:54] the book
[45:55] Hey listen ho God can't change
[45:59] so he didn't change this book
[46:02] he just delayed the time for it to come
[46:05] into existence
[46:08] so he could be a Healer Redeemer ah
[46:11] Jehovah
[46:12] all the compound names
[46:15] it was in him
[46:18] but if he were to produce this book it
[46:20] would have never been
[46:22] it would have just been Perfection just
[46:24] like what we're going to yeah
[46:27] just like what we're going to an
[46:29] eternity in a human body
[46:31] eating drinking fellowshipping
[46:35] but listen if God would have just done
[46:37] that over here
[46:40] there would have been no Isaiah
[46:46] that have been no Abraham
[46:49] there had been no Malachi to stand one
[46:52] day and say
[46:53] behold
[46:55] I send you Elijah the prophet
[46:58] that would have been none of that
[47:01] it would have just been us
[47:04] that had been no foolish virgin
[47:08] come on
[47:09] it had been no foolish virgin
[47:11] because that wasn't in this part
[47:13] this is the Eternal section
[47:15] they're going to be given eternal life
[47:18] right
[47:20] this is not
[47:22] these people are not given eternal life
[47:24] they are eternal life
[47:27] right
[47:29] now it's time for y'all to go to sleep
[47:32] I figured it hit about what time is it
[47:34] now three o'clock
[47:36] about time about 30 minutes after I
[47:38] started
[47:39] so anyway check yourself just for a
[47:42] minute
[47:43] so this is this is all God All Souls are
[47:46] mine so he's he's releasing Abel Kane
[47:52] not from here though
[47:54] no no no he's releasing him from here
[47:57] them from here
[47:58] I'm going to have an Isaiah I'm gonna
[48:00] have a Jeremiah I'm also going to have a
[48:02] Balaam
[48:04] I'm also going to have a cane
[48:07] but not in this book
[48:09] this book's special
[48:11] this book is sealed
[48:15] by Seven Seals
[48:17] sealed up nobody can understand
[48:22] but I'm going to have an Isaiah Jeremiah
[48:24] Ezekiel because see they've got to what
[48:26] speak the word so that he could come in
[48:29] flesh and brother Robert said he stepped
[48:31] out on the prophecy of all those
[48:33] Prophets
[48:35] so it's plans perfect but to get us From
[48:38] Here to Eternity there had to be a
[48:41] redeemer come
[48:42] and he had to come according to the word
[48:45] of God because he was the word of God I
[48:47] just read that to you and that word was
[48:49] made flesh it was spoken by Isaiah
[48:51] Jeremiah Ezekiel and and sorry if I
[48:54] forget any of y'all little prophets all
[48:55] down through here and I am because it's
[48:57] the whole Bible is what is the is the
[48:59] word of God okay
[49:01] all right but you got your minor
[49:02] problems and your major problems but
[49:03] anyway Moses and all that see even Moses
[49:06] listen Moses is not
[49:08] a born-again believer
[49:13] he never receives a new birth
[49:16] Isaiah never receives a new birth right
[49:20] they received an anointing they were in
[49:22] the mind of God and God said I'm going
[49:24] to use them and they're going to turn to
[49:27] me
[49:28] and let me use their voice
[49:31] defeat what I want to get to the people
[49:33] so in them yielding themselves to me I'm
[49:36] gonna make them eternal
[49:39] because Isaiah will be there
[49:41] Jeremiah will be there Abraham will be
[49:44] there but listen they will not be bride
[49:48] they're not part of this book
[49:50] now listen they're in this book but I'm
[49:52] talking about this book we're locked on
[49:53] about over here
[49:55] the book of the redeemed the book of the
[49:58] Bride yes
[50:00] because today by the baptism of the Holy
[50:02] Ghost you got that in your soul yes
[50:04] Isaiah Dutton
[50:07] listen the blood of bulls and goats only
[50:10] covered
[50:12] sin
[50:15] it's still piled up
[50:17] but when you come to Calvary
[50:19] he puts one hand that way and one hand
[50:21] that way he takes them all in forgives
[50:24] them of their sin
[50:26] and then says I'm going to have a ride
[50:30] let go of these names in this book
[50:34] because these are the ones that got lost
[50:38] over here
[50:42] making any sense
[50:44] so this is withheld this is special
[50:49] listen
[50:51] I love Louise with all my heart
[50:55] but he's I know
[50:56] but you're not a Dale
[50:59] sorry
[51:00] I know that's hard sometimes to even be
[51:03] one
[51:04] but um when I open
[51:07] when I open my oh Lord when I open my
[51:10] family album
[51:12] Luis is not in here
[51:15] my family album personal
[51:18] The Dales the Family Bible
[51:21] right
[51:24] because he wasn't born from my lineage
[51:28] right
[51:30] but now listen what about God
[51:33] has a lineage
[51:35] okay
[51:37] he has people that he's permitted to
[51:39] come on the Earth
[51:41] but they're not part of his lineage
[51:44] this is his lineage because what is what
[51:46] is the lineage of me and Terence and
[51:48] Anna and all the ones down to that it's
[51:50] from my dad
[51:52] dale dale blood Dale genetics
[51:56] God blood God genetics
[51:59] God family
[52:02] but now he's gonna have an
[52:03] ombud body but when
[52:06] will it be
[52:08] the family of God
[52:12] because see that's what the importance
[52:13] of the opening of the seals are that I
[52:15] ain't going to get to today
[52:18] is to be able to see because remember
[52:20] brother Brown said what did he do when
[52:22] the book opened in Revelation 5 he said
[52:24] John was crying at one time
[52:28] this book was closed
[52:31] sealed
[52:33] remember it was really a scroll not a
[52:35] bug but scroll
[52:37] see it was Seven Seals no way anybody
[52:38] can know what was in it
[52:40] but when uh but when it came into the
[52:42] hand of the orig from the original owner
[52:44] into Jesus Christ's hand
[52:46] now
[52:48] listen
[52:51] the scripture that speaks of the
[52:52] bridegroom
[52:54] speaks also with abroad
[52:57] him standing in Revelations 5 was me and
[53:01] you inside of him standing there
[53:05] that's why brother Brown
[53:07] [Music]
[53:12] 's because John got born again
[53:15] you get his book and you get it open and
[53:18] you get to reading it you read your name
[53:20] in here
[53:21] you read yourself
[53:24] You're such bad things in here from you
[53:25] God don't have them in this book
[53:31] prove that Revelations 19 I understand
[53:34] you made yourself ready somehow
[53:40] so Genesis 1 26 that's the soul of God
[53:45] but God said All Souls are mine
[53:50] but not to Genesis 1 26 man
[53:55] that's him
[53:57] this is him remember it's not unless
[53:59] you're part of him this is him
[54:01] all right
[54:03] made manifest in a many-membered bride
[54:07] okay but now in his mind like I said
[54:09] before he has to be able to bring a soul
[54:13] that was part of his mind part of the
[54:15] seeing of everything like Balaam uh
[54:18] Judas
[54:19] all the different ones all the different
[54:21] ones that are the bad part we say the
[54:23] bad part Cain he saw those two
[54:27] he just didn't preserve them in a book
[54:30] because they weren't part of not saying
[54:31] you're Judas no but they weren't in the
[54:34] family album
[54:36] okay didn't find them nowhere but when
[54:39] the Books open over here and I remember
[54:40] it doesn't change from there to here
[54:43] God can't add in that one
[54:45] now listen in the other Book of Life
[54:48] your name can be taken out
[54:52] judas's name was written in the book
[54:55] but it was taken out
[54:59] your name never moved your name stayed
[55:01] around where it was at now listen
[55:02] brother but I'm sure your name goes on
[55:04] the book is the believer of
[55:04] sanctification that's to you on Earth
[55:07] we're talking about the new in glory
[55:10] that's why I believe and I don't have a
[55:12] quote for it but I believe well I do
[55:14] Paul said we're living in Heavenly
[55:16] places right
[55:17] your soul by the new birth you're in
[55:19] another dimension
[55:21] your Soul's just in another dimension
[55:23] because it's not even of this world it's
[55:24] not even supposed to been in this world
[55:26] by the new birth and you're not supposed
[55:28] to be here
[55:30] but you are to do what to sleep I mean
[55:33] to give glory to God
[55:38] preach
[55:42] holy water here we go ready
[55:47] I'm glad I'm hoping my mom was not
[55:49] watching
[55:50] that got on the ground
[55:53] I really hope she is
[55:56] Genesis 1 26 man though that's a special
[55:58] group
[56:00] of people
[56:02] God has allowed souls to come on Earth
[56:04] and he's the only one who can give life
[56:07] so he gives life
[56:09] but remember when you come over to the
[56:11] New Testament though he said hey don't
[56:13] worry about the guy that can kill your
[56:15] body
[56:17] there's only one person
[56:19] see Satan can't even destroy your soul
[56:25] that's how much power he don't have
[56:28] he don't have power to do anything
[56:30] except
[56:31] make you sleepy
[56:34] and all them other things he does
[56:36] but he has no power to destroy your soul
[56:38] you destroy him yourself
[56:41] listen blame nobody
[56:43] on the dead judgment it's not going to
[56:46] be Satan standing beside you it's going
[56:47] to be you
[56:48] and you're gonna have to give an account
[56:50] that's why we have an advocate here on
[56:54] the Earth
[56:55] we don't have to go to the lifetime
[56:57] judgment we have one right here today
[56:59] standing right here saying father
[57:01] forgiving yes the real him didn't do
[57:04] that
[57:07] wait a minute
[57:09] Glory you ought to wake up
[57:13] that's it that's why I'm that ad but
[57:15] remember
[57:16] this Genesis 1 26 didn't need an
[57:18] advocate
[57:24] got it
[57:26] but you need one over here
[57:28] because you're in a fallen condition
[57:31] in your spirit realm is still being beat
[57:33] up by the devil
[57:34] but that's all
[57:36] like I said God you know Jesus is not
[57:39] standing here being your Advocate saying
[57:41] now I don't know why he did that
[57:45] um but would you please no he knows
[57:47] exactly it didn't happen in your soul
[57:48] that's why a sinner sins
[57:52] from their soul
[57:55] thank God for a prophet that told us
[57:57] Christians have sins
[58:00] but it's not in the soul
[58:02] it's not something to determine whether
[58:04] you go to the white Throne or not it
[58:07] determines how you get through the day
[58:11] he determines how you grow up in that
[58:14] Satan does not listen Satan doesn't want
[58:17] Jesus on this Earth again
[58:20] he can't defeat him the first time
[58:22] he's not going to be able to defeat him
[58:24] this time
[58:26] in a bride in a many-membered body not
[58:30] just one
[58:32] and a mini-membered body
[58:36] a bunch of little Jesus is running
[58:38] around here
[58:40] born by what the word yes
[58:43] poured by the word of God
[58:46] the perfect word of God
[58:48] second Peter 1 verse two say grace and
[58:50] peace I'm not getting where I want to go
[58:53] Grace and peace be multiplying the use
[58:55] of the knowledge of God of Jesus our
[58:56] lord now remember this is First Peter
[58:57] starting this is your new birth
[58:59] according as is what divine power he is
[59:01] not not Peter's
[59:03] he is Jesus right divine power I'm going
[59:07] to read what that word divine means in a
[59:09] minute hath given unto us
[59:11] all things that pertaining to life in
[59:12] godliness to the knowledge of him that's
[59:14] called us to go and virtue whereby are
[59:16] you given to us exceeding great and
[59:18] pressures promises listen
[59:20] we didn't need those promises over here
[59:24] there was no need of any of that over
[59:27] here
[59:30] you know what I'm kind of glad we had a
[59:32] fall
[59:34] three
[59:38] because we know about Redemption now
[59:41] see there's Angels standing over here
[59:44] that are still in the same place they
[59:46] were standing over here they're standing
[59:47] today
[59:48] they don't know anything about
[59:49] Redemption
[59:50] they don't know anything about fall
[59:53] they don't know about being healed
[59:55] they don't know about being redeemed and
[59:57] that that God's given us Revelation and
[1:00:00] more Revelation they don't know anything
[1:00:01] about that
[1:00:03] but we as humans do because of a fall
[1:00:06] because of the Fall we come here
[1:00:09] able to get on our knees and say God I'm
[1:00:11] so sorry
[1:00:12] forgive me of what I just thought or or
[1:00:15] his brother Bob was talking about
[1:00:16] forgive me
[1:00:18] for speaking against a brother or for or
[1:00:20] for thinking bad thoughts against the
[1:00:22] brother we got to quit that now we do it
[1:00:26] let me get on out a minute we do that
[1:00:34] Bob you started there
[1:00:43] we gotta love her brother
[1:00:44] yeah
[1:00:46] the Bible says love them as you love
[1:00:47] yourself
[1:00:48] pray for those who despitefully use you
[1:00:51] try that sometime
[1:00:56] do good to those that hate you
[1:00:58] try that sometime
[1:01:03] the Bible said it keeps coals of fire on
[1:01:05] her head if you do in other words it
[1:01:06] Heats everything back on them
[1:01:08] when you don't get mad listen Satan
[1:01:10] loves to provoke you to see if you your
[1:01:13] reaction
[1:01:14] and if you don't provoke back like Jesus
[1:01:16] you know Jesus Satan's standing there
[1:01:19] talking to Jesus said hey man if you're
[1:01:21] if you're if you're I know you can turn
[1:01:23] these stones into bread
[1:01:26] and man you look hungry
[1:01:29] you haven't ate for 40 days
[1:01:33] Satan in his old stupid mind
[1:01:35] he said he's going to take me up on that
[1:01:38] and I'm gonna own him
[1:01:40] now
[1:01:42] the Lord just said
[1:01:44] no
[1:01:46] no Satan
[1:01:47] don't provoke God
[1:01:49] the whole thing was don't provoke I'm
[1:01:51] not don't you're trying to provoke me
[1:01:54] I'm just gonna tell you what the word
[1:01:56] says
[1:01:57] in other words I'm not going to jump
[1:02:00] back in and start fighting with you I'm
[1:02:02] not fighting with the Devil
[1:02:04] everybody with me yeah we fight demons
[1:02:06] all the time you understand what I mean
[1:02:08] but I'm not gonna fight him when he says
[1:02:10] you're this that and the other and I
[1:02:11] know I'm not
[1:02:18] let that real man speak
[1:02:20] that real man inside of you that real
[1:02:22] sister too and I'm getting the sisters
[1:02:25] that's all of us let that thing speak
[1:02:27] inside of you
[1:02:29] let it out
[1:02:31] we're about giving us exceeding great
[1:02:33] and precious promises that by these you
[1:02:34] might be partakers of the Divine and
[1:02:36] other partakers
[1:02:38] all right now listen we didn't lose we
[1:02:41] we just didn't come here with that
[1:02:42] divine nature
[1:02:44] no but but but we didn't come down to a
[1:02:47] place where God said
[1:02:48] I forgot him I want to write him in no
[1:02:51] you were already there
[1:02:55] he was hearing your
[1:02:57] s through the blood
[1:02:59] huh
[1:03:00] remember brother Brown said one second
[1:03:02] and God in front of God like we are he
[1:03:04] said we'll be out of here we'll be gone
[1:03:05] he hears your voice through the blood
[1:03:09] he said that's my kid
[1:03:12] I'll promise you if Zoe eurago
[1:03:15] was down at the stadium
[1:03:18] at the Braves game 50 000 people
[1:03:23] and she got in trouble and started
[1:03:24] screaming
[1:03:28] Christine and
[1:03:30] Luis wouldn't know exactly
[1:03:33] who that was
[1:03:37] so don't be worried
[1:03:40] will you get in trouble in front of
[1:03:42] seven billion people
[1:03:44] God's going to hear your voice
[1:03:46] above all the clamor and all the all the
[1:03:49] screaming
[1:03:51] you just say Lord
[1:03:53] I need you
[1:03:56] you know what he does he goes hey
[1:03:59] my kid's talking
[1:04:01] need y'all to be quiet
[1:04:04] think how much power
[1:04:06] being in the family of God is
[1:04:09] being in the family of God just being
[1:04:11] born again
[1:04:13] gives you a lot now watch this that you
[1:04:14] might be protective of the divine nature
[1:04:16] of having escaped the corruption lives
[1:04:17] in the world through lust now look at
[1:04:18] this word divine the word divine
[1:04:20] actually means fails
[1:04:22] which is God
[1:04:24] or the godhead
[1:04:25] of Christ aren't we part of all that
[1:04:28] spoken of the only and true God
[1:04:31] whatever can in any respect be likened
[1:04:34] to God
[1:04:38] that's the divine nature of God
[1:04:41] Romans 8 14 says if you have not you
[1:04:43] have received the spirit of adoption
[1:04:45] whereby you cry I have a father so when
[1:04:47] you receive the new birth you know that
[1:04:49] all it does is just calls your name out
[1:04:50] of the family album so that means that
[1:04:52] you know
[1:04:53] Who You Are
[1:04:55] all right
[1:04:56] amen because remember you're shut off
[1:04:59] you're alienated from knowing anything
[1:05:01] about that that's why you can't go back
[1:05:02] and say me and Donnie was back before
[1:05:04] the world and we were shaking hands and
[1:05:05] we were
[1:05:07] listen when all that shouting for joy
[1:05:09] and all that and job that was in the
[1:05:10] mind of God that wasn't people running
[1:05:11] around okay everybody with me on that I
[1:05:14] know some of you went back and said well
[1:05:15] what about that well that's not people
[1:05:18] running around it was in the mind of God
[1:05:22] there's a spot
[1:05:24] and that thought was projected today Joe
[1:05:27] where were you
[1:05:28] he actually asked Joe where he was he
[1:05:30] knows where we are
[1:05:34] where were you he didn't ask me that he
[1:05:37] knew where I was I'm in this book
[1:05:40] he knows every name
[1:05:42] and all that's doing now is is it's
[1:05:44] revealing
[1:05:47] you on Earth
[1:05:49] that's what you was back there
[1:05:53] everybody with me on that
[1:05:55] I'm a son and daughter of God I have the
[1:05:58] promises I have the divine nature I have
[1:06:01] eternal life
[1:06:04] I have passed judgment
[1:06:06] if I have to go by the grave so what my
[1:06:09] name's still in the book
[1:06:11] God didn't have to shift how Thomas's
[1:06:13] name around in the book
[1:06:15] no he just said hang on man buddy he
[1:06:16] said the rest of them they got to get
[1:06:18] ready and when they get ready we'll come
[1:06:20] back
[1:06:20] we're all going to come back together
[1:06:22] actually
[1:06:24] yeah they'll be all right
[1:06:27] maybe I'll woke you up a little bit and
[1:06:28] if children then heirs Heirs of God now
[1:06:31] what is the heirs
[1:06:36] you're an error of God
[1:06:38] and Jordan heirs with Christ because
[1:06:40] he's the one that was holding the book
[1:06:45] also the Father and Jesus is not the
[1:06:47] same person
[1:06:49] he just got a name down here
[1:06:55] same guy
[1:06:57] okay there's not there's not a father
[1:06:59] here and a different person down there
[1:07:01] that came out from there no you're not
[1:07:04] even another person that came out from
[1:07:06] God when he said let us make man in our
[1:07:08] own image
[1:07:10] even when brother random would say that
[1:07:13] that when the logos says something
[1:07:15] stepped out
[1:07:16] to speak
[1:07:18] it was just God stepping forward and
[1:07:20] speaking
[1:07:22] wasn't leaving somebody behind where
[1:07:24] there's two or three Spirits running
[1:07:25] around no it's the same spirit of God
[1:07:28] in the same person of God
[1:07:31] and he spoke your name at the new birth
[1:07:34] and he didn't have to go into another
[1:07:35] book to find it
[1:07:37] he came straight from him
[1:07:40] all the father has what given me
[1:07:45] will come
[1:07:46] and uh what not lose one of them
[1:07:50] praise the Lord
[1:07:53] wherefore lay inside all malice and all
[1:07:55] guile hypocrisies envies and evil
[1:07:57] speaking that's newborn babes as they
[1:07:58] were talking this morning this is kind
[1:07:59] of where we stopped at
[1:08:01] as newborn babies desire
[1:08:04] the sincere milk of the word that you
[1:08:06] may grow thereby
[1:08:07] if so be that what you have tasted that
[1:08:09] the Lord is gracious to whom coming us
[1:08:12] into a living Stone we're heading to the
[1:08:14] stretch of a perfect man disallowed of
[1:08:16] men
[1:08:18] not everybody is going to be a child of
[1:08:20] God
[1:08:21] not everybody is going to come to The
[1:08:23] Headstone or come to adoption
[1:08:26] it's your choice though
[1:08:29] it's your choice
[1:08:31] to whom coming us into a living Stone
[1:08:34] disallowed of men
[1:08:37] and precious
[1:08:39] all right now look this is at your new
[1:08:42] birth now because we got to get this
[1:08:43] checkbook
[1:08:45] because that checkbook's gonna
[1:08:47] appear back over here in your adoption
[1:08:51] but it's going to have a little bit
[1:08:52] different a little bit different
[1:08:54] terminology
[1:08:56] when a man is born again the spirit of
[1:08:57] God brother Brian 1955.
[1:08:59] God gives him a checkbook
[1:09:04] that'll last him all through life's
[1:09:06] journey
[1:09:08] and at the bottom of each check has got
[1:09:10] Jesus's name signed to it because he's
[1:09:12] the one that redeemed you
[1:09:14] right
[1:09:15] and he has all the power to back it up
[1:09:19] you don't yeah because you might not
[1:09:22] write a check just exactly right
[1:09:25] come on
[1:09:27] power without character
[1:09:30] it's a bounce check
[1:09:33] Jesus's name signed to it and you just
[1:09:35] fill in what you need
[1:09:38] it's yours already paid for now surely
[1:09:41] you're not afraid that it won't be
[1:09:43] cashed
[1:09:44] if you're afraid
[1:09:46] if you're afraid just hold that book in
[1:09:48] your pocket he said
[1:09:49] but no if you're born again he gives you
[1:09:52] that checkbook and you know for a fact
[1:09:54] that Jesus is your Redeemer your healer
[1:09:56] and all these different things you just
[1:09:57] write the check
[1:09:59] you don't worry about
[1:10:00] that name down there because you know
[1:10:03] who that is
[1:10:05] and he has all power in Heaven and Earth
[1:10:07] backing him up
[1:10:09] but at that point though he's not able
[1:10:12] to give you the checkbook
[1:10:15] and you sign it
[1:10:17] not yet
[1:10:19] but you're in the same line
[1:10:22] all right
[1:10:24] out there it's the same my mama would
[1:10:26] give any of y'all well never mind she
[1:10:28] wouldn't give us one either a check with
[1:10:30] our her name written at the bottom of it
[1:10:33] but we're family she should then she has
[1:10:36] but you understand what I mean if you're
[1:10:38] not in the family why would he write you
[1:10:39] a check
[1:10:44] why would he write you a check why would
[1:10:46] he hand you a checkbook
[1:10:48] but the ones in the family though
[1:10:51] he gives them a checkbook with his name
[1:10:53] already signed Bank Of Heaven whatever
[1:10:57] you need
[1:11:00] because you're in the family of God
[1:11:03] your name's been called you have
[1:11:05] received the new birth you've received
[1:11:07] that piece of Genesis 1 26 that God saw
[1:11:10] over here you you have received that
[1:11:12] piece of
[1:11:15] right
[1:11:17] because remember look we can't be silly
[1:11:19] we're not the fullness of the godhead
[1:11:21] bodily in our own self
[1:11:25] but listen
[1:11:27] God's soul is who
[1:11:30] somebody say God
[1:11:32] soul is God all right if we're part of
[1:11:34] the soul of God
[1:11:37] we're just another extension
[1:11:40] or another attribute
[1:11:43] but it's still God
[1:11:45] because there's only one form of eternal
[1:11:47] life and that's God
[1:11:50] so you're then you're not a second
[1:11:52] person
[1:11:53] you're the person of God in another form
[1:11:57] called bride
[1:11:58] and that's what he wants he
[1:12:06] let's look just for a second well ain't
[1:12:08] gotten a Spirit Room yep but let's talk
[1:12:10] for just for a second that's all right
[1:12:11] we'll finish up a Wednesday night
[1:12:14] let's go to the spirit
[1:12:17] your soul
[1:12:18] if you're born
[1:12:20] it's it's it's complete your soul
[1:12:26] but listen sin is so awful in the sight
[1:12:29] of God
[1:12:31] so he will allow you as a free moral
[1:12:34] agent
[1:12:36] to press that thing
[1:12:38] suppress it
[1:12:44] I mean why if we're all born again why
[1:12:46] are we all still sick why are we dying
[1:12:47] why don't we
[1:12:51] because we're not believing who we are
[1:12:52] we're not believing who that real person
[1:12:54] inside of us is
[1:12:56] even though you may have it
[1:12:58] we're not getting it
[1:13:02] maybe we're not getting it all
[1:13:06] but I pray to God that we can because
[1:13:09] we've been given the word of God to
[1:13:11] rightly divide what your soul does for
[1:13:13] you what your spirit realm does for you
[1:13:15] and what your flesh does for you
[1:13:19] right I don't believe anybody else any
[1:13:21] other time I'm not talking about me I'm
[1:13:23] talking about this when brother I'm come
[1:13:24] he sends us the perfect word of God and
[1:13:27] it rightly divides
[1:13:29] the soul from the spirit from the body
[1:13:33] tells us over here that Soul faith will
[1:13:36] die that's it
[1:13:38] middle round five senses out of Rim five
[1:13:42] senses
[1:13:43] and how they work
[1:13:45] Peter understands understood a little
[1:13:47] bit of it because he talks about the
[1:13:49] divine nature of God
[1:13:50] so you receive the new birth and in
[1:13:52] second Peter he says in verse five he
[1:13:54] says and besides this
[1:13:57] huh
[1:13:58] we've read it many times before read it
[1:14:00] almost 100 times but look
[1:14:02] is that a more now clear to you
[1:14:06] your new birth is in your soul
[1:14:10] it will impact your spirit realm if
[1:14:12] you'll let it because listen your soul
[1:14:14] only feeds on what the word of God
[1:14:19] it will not feed on error
[1:14:22] it will not feed
[1:14:25] on part word
[1:14:30] that's why the pure word had to come in
[1:14:32] the end time
[1:14:34] to energize your soul that when your
[1:14:36] soul gets ready to speak there's not
[1:14:38] something there it says that's not true
[1:14:44] a man
[1:14:46] that's why it was so important for
[1:14:48] Malachi to speak and for for something
[1:14:50] to materialize out of Malachi a prophet
[1:14:53] with the spirit of Elijah they can put
[1:14:55] all this stuff back together he can pull
[1:14:57] it apart and put it back together
[1:15:00] so Peter says and besides this besides
[1:15:03] this divine nature besides even though
[1:15:05] you get the new birth even though you
[1:15:08] get eternal life in your soul besides
[1:15:11] this giving all diligence add amen
[1:15:17] I thought you couldn't add to God
[1:15:20] you can't add to God but you can add to
[1:15:22] you
[1:15:24] because you're still a human sorry you
[1:15:26] still have a memories and conscious
[1:15:27] imagination
[1:15:28] and that's where the Battleground is the
[1:15:30] greatest battle ever fault is not in
[1:15:32] your soul
[1:15:35] you're either one or the other and if
[1:15:36] you've got one in fact you got that old
[1:15:38] Chief demon out then you're good yes
[1:15:41] but that's not all
[1:15:43] Peter's saying hey I was there today at
[1:15:46] Pentecost something came down inside of
[1:15:48] me and just burnt everything out all
[1:15:50] that all that old fisherman junk and
[1:15:53] cussing and
[1:15:57] spewing and stewing and cutting people's
[1:16:00] ears off and telling Jesus I'll never
[1:16:02] deny you don't you wash my feet
[1:16:06] um
[1:16:07] then he said then he then he got Peter
[1:16:09] and he said
[1:16:11] hey I want you to preach this
[1:16:14] preach this to my people
[1:16:16] because 2 000 years from the time you
[1:16:18] write it somebody's gonna need it
[1:16:21] and no
[1:16:23] what it's for
[1:16:24] ever and know how to get it
[1:16:27] maybe they didn't know back in the in
[1:16:29] the in the church ages
[1:16:31] but this time for the full word to be
[1:16:33] made manifest time for the opening of
[1:16:35] the seals to open up to show us that we
[1:16:37] do need
[1:16:39] Faith versions of Godless brother
[1:16:41] kindness not just humanly but we need
[1:16:43] God's virtues
[1:16:48] besides this giving all diligence add to
[1:16:50] your new birth
[1:16:53] knowledge
[1:16:54] temperance
[1:16:56] patience
[1:16:57] godliness brotherly kindness
[1:17:00] charity
[1:17:03] Ephesians 4 verse 14.
[1:17:05] the women henceforth be no more children
[1:17:07] all right now we're not children anymore
[1:17:09] we've come out we've we've got born
[1:17:11] again
[1:17:12] now we're working on the spirit realm of
[1:17:14] us which is our playground all right
[1:17:17] that's Devil's Playground
[1:17:18] everybody with me if it's not yours pray
[1:17:21] for me
[1:17:22] my memories what's killing me
[1:17:25] my reasoning is what's killing me
[1:17:28] and all those other ones
[1:17:31] imagination
[1:17:33] and carried about look that way his
[1:17:35] fourth be no more children tossed to and
[1:17:37] fro and carried about what is he telling
[1:17:39] in Ephesians he's talking to a mature
[1:17:41] group he's saying we got you you got to
[1:17:42] come out of that being babies
[1:17:44] you got to get away from it being babies
[1:17:47] I I can die for you and Patch you and
[1:17:50] give you a a pacifier every once in a
[1:17:52] while but you gotta come out of that
[1:17:54] you gotta start eating some strong meat
[1:17:56] what was Paul saying you got to start
[1:17:58] understanding what I'm telling you
[1:18:00] and not wondering about with it
[1:18:03] then we hit forth be no more children
[1:18:05] toss to and fro and carried about
[1:18:09] with every wind of Doctrine
[1:18:13] by the slide of men
[1:18:15] and cunning craftiness whereby they lie
[1:18:18] and wait to deceive but speaking the
[1:18:20] truth in love may grow up into him in
[1:18:23] all things which is the head even Christ
[1:18:25] pulling
[1:18:27] that thing's pulling you up that statue
[1:18:29] of perfect man
[1:18:31] first Peter 2 verse 1 says ye also as
[1:18:34] Lively stones are built up a spiritual
[1:18:36] house a holy priesthood to offer up
[1:18:39] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[1:18:41] by God to God by Jesus Christ wherefore
[1:18:45] also it is contained in the scripture
[1:18:46] behold I lay in Zion a Chief Cornerstone
[1:18:49] look a Chief Cornerstone he's not
[1:18:51] talking about that because that's been
[1:18:52] rejected
[1:18:53] the head the son of man Ministry
[1:18:56] but he started down here building on the
[1:18:58] day of Pentecost as the Cornerstone
[1:19:00] all right to build up a house what when
[1:19:04] we when you put a foundation down what
[1:19:06] do you do you build something on it
[1:19:08] but it's got to be a sure Foundation
[1:19:10] which it is
[1:19:13] I say the word of God is a sure
[1:19:15] Foundation
[1:19:16] a cheat I lay a Zion a Chief Cornerstone
[1:19:19] elect
[1:19:20] precious and he that believeth on him
[1:19:23] look shall not be confounded
[1:19:28] unto you therefore which believe he is
[1:19:30] precious
[1:19:31] but unto them which be disobedient all
[1:19:35] right the stone which the builders
[1:19:37] disallowed in other words they didn't
[1:19:38] allow that
[1:19:40] to come back
[1:19:42] they didn't allow Jesus Christ to come
[1:19:43] back in the son of man Ministry they the
[1:19:46] preachers
[1:19:47] hello somebody
[1:19:50] the same is made the head of the corner
[1:19:53] so God's going to have his group of
[1:19:55] people
[1:19:57] and a stone of stumbling a rock of
[1:19:59] offense even to them which stumble at
[1:20:02] the what
[1:20:03] at the word being disobedient now listen
[1:20:07] if you're born again your soul today you
[1:20:09] cannot be disobedient to God
[1:20:12] he can't be disobedient with himself
[1:20:18] so where is it it's in your spirit realm
[1:20:20] where you have the issues
[1:20:24] Satan can still play there
[1:20:28] stumble at the word being disobedient
[1:20:31] because what is it when we get into
[1:20:34] adoption what is adoption if you've got
[1:20:37] three children three boys
[1:20:40] the ones that are what
[1:20:42] the ones that are disobedient are not
[1:20:44] adopted
[1:20:48] the ones that are obedient are adopted
[1:20:52] so what does it come down to me and you
[1:20:55] disobeying the word of God or obeying
[1:20:58] the word of God
[1:21:00] all right
[1:21:01] we're into also they were appointed but
[1:21:04] ye are a chosen generation
[1:21:06] a royal priesthood a holy nation A
[1:21:09] peculiar people that you should show
[1:21:11] forth the Praises of him who hath called
[1:21:14] you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous
[1:21:17] Light
[1:21:18] which in times past were not a people
[1:21:25] in the mind of God you are the people of
[1:21:26] God of the children of God but he sure
[1:21:28] didn't look like it when you were doing
[1:21:29] your XYZ out in the world
[1:21:31] hello somebody
[1:21:34] which in times past were not a people
[1:21:37] but are now the people of God
[1:21:42] what a place what a position
[1:21:45] which had not obtained Mercy
[1:21:49] but now
[1:21:51] have obtained Mercy
[1:21:53] I like that scripture
[1:21:55] First Peter 1 verse 22 we'll stop right
[1:21:58] here won't go any further
[1:22:00] see you have look now look here we go
[1:22:02] this we we're talking we talked about
[1:22:04] the soul now we're in the spirit realm
[1:22:06] got it all right Shake stuff just for a
[1:22:09] minute
[1:22:09] seeing you have purified your souls
[1:22:12] Souls
[1:22:14] that don't mean you got two Souls that
[1:22:16] means talking about everybody okay
[1:22:19] not that you got two three Souls you got
[1:22:21] one Soul either born again or not we
[1:22:24] don't we have to go over that again I
[1:22:25] don't think so
[1:22:26] see seeing you have purified your souls
[1:22:28] and obeyed how do you purify your soul
[1:22:32] and obeying the truth
[1:22:34] [Music]
[1:22:35] see that you love one another with pure
[1:22:37] heart fervently being born again
[1:22:40] now listen
[1:22:41] you have to watch that because remember
[1:22:43] you can't if you're born again in your
[1:22:46] soul you can't be born again again
[1:22:49] foreign
[1:22:54] you're perfect
[1:22:55] that soul is at Genesis 1 26 person no
[1:22:58] less
[1:23:00] but it's encapsulator or caught in time
[1:23:02] it's caught in the fall
[1:23:05] that's how horrible this fall was that
[1:23:07] we were talking about
[1:23:12] but being born again
[1:23:14] not of corruptable seed but of
[1:23:16] Incorruptible by what by the word of God
[1:23:19] which liveth and biteeth
[1:23:21] forever Hebrews 5 verse 10.
[1:23:25] called of God and high priest after the
[1:23:27] order of Melchizedek of whom we have
[1:23:29] many things to say and hard to be
[1:23:31] uttered seeing you are dull of hearing
[1:23:34] for when for the time you ought to be
[1:23:36] teachers
[1:23:37] now he's admonishing the people you
[1:23:40] shouldn't be teachers by now
[1:23:42] I'm just telling you what Paul said
[1:23:45] oh he's just talking about them what
[1:23:46] he's talking about us
[1:23:48] you have need that one teach you again
[1:23:51] which be the first principles of the
[1:23:53] Oracles of God and are become such as
[1:23:55] have need of milk and not strong meat in
[1:23:57] other words you backed up somewhere
[1:24:00] went back to drinking milk again
[1:24:02] you should be eating meat
[1:24:05] for everyone that uses milk it's white
[1:24:08] unskillful or may I put in their
[1:24:11] disobedient
[1:24:14] huh listen God's not going to adopt a
[1:24:17] child drinking milk
[1:24:20] he's only going to adopt somebody that's
[1:24:22] fully mature that eats meat I mean the
[1:24:24] meat of the word of God not just
[1:24:26] simple Doctrine everybody with me
[1:24:30] all right
[1:24:31] or you become such as having need of
[1:24:33] milk and not strong meat for everyone
[1:24:34] that uses milk is unskillful in the word
[1:24:38] word of righteousness for he is a babe
[1:24:42] but strong meat belongeth to them that
[1:24:46] are of full age even those who by reason
[1:24:48] of use
[1:24:51] have their senses exercised
[1:24:54] to discern
[1:24:56] good
[1:24:58] from evil
[1:25:03] we'll get to this Wednesday night
[1:25:04] accordions here has chosen Us in him
[1:25:06] before the foundation of the world oh
[1:25:07] wait a minute
[1:25:11] Paul wants to call the Revelation about
[1:25:12] Genesis 1 26.
[1:25:17] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[1:25:19] of the world
[1:25:24] Paul was a prophet remember
[1:25:25] he could see things
[1:25:28] it's like giving Clarity to write what
[1:25:30] he did and for us to be able even 2 000
[1:25:32] years ago
[1:25:33] from there to now be able to understand
[1:25:35] what he said and it'd be clear that they
[1:25:37] weren't going through the same identical
[1:25:38] thing
[1:25:41] according as he has chosen Us in him
[1:25:43] before the foundation of the world that
[1:25:45] look we should be holy
[1:25:48] and Without Blame
[1:25:51] him before him in love
[1:25:53] having predestinated looked down the
[1:25:56] line saw us
[1:25:59] come to maturity and predetermine that
[1:26:02] by his foreknowledge
[1:26:05] having predestinated us into the
[1:26:07] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:26:09] himself in other words he's going to
[1:26:11] have an adopted group of people
[1:26:14] and they can't be in the sixth dimension
[1:26:22] they're already sealed away
[1:26:25] they're gone on
[1:26:27] whatever wherever each one of them were
[1:26:29] that's where they were and that's where
[1:26:30] they're going to stay
[1:26:32] right
[1:26:34] but to come to adoption means being
[1:26:36] where you can speak
[1:26:40] and write your own check
[1:26:42] that's not over there that's here
[1:26:45] there's provision made God saw he
[1:26:49] predestinated by what by four four
[1:26:51] knowledge what he saw
[1:26:54] he saw a group of people come to that
[1:26:57] yes us
[1:26:59] because if you're passed on you can't
[1:27:01] come to adoption you might could come to
[1:27:03] adoption but you're going on you're not
[1:27:05] here where you can keep going on
[1:27:06] everybody with me
[1:27:08] having predestinated us into the
[1:27:10] adoption of children now You Gotta Be
[1:27:12] You Gotta Be a child to be a doctor you
[1:27:14] got to come into the family but then you
[1:27:16] got to grow brother Brown talks about
[1:27:18] you know the Holy Ghost he goes and he
[1:27:19] he goes and he watches the child and he
[1:27:21] goes back to the father and he says hey
[1:27:23] this guy's a chip off your own of the
[1:27:25] old block or looks just like you and
[1:27:27] actors like it where he says man this
[1:27:28] guy's a rascal
[1:27:35] you sit on the front row that's what you
[1:27:37] get I mean predestinated us into the
[1:27:40] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:27:42] wear to himself
[1:27:44] see because we could in adoption you
[1:27:46] become so much the father
[1:27:48] to your name's good as on a checkbook
[1:27:50] and says this
[1:27:52] in other words all power and Heaven and
[1:27:54] Earth been given unto who you in
[1:27:57] adoption not just being a baby
[1:28:00] not just be
[1:28:03] no eat meat
[1:28:05] the meat of the word the seals what
[1:28:07] we're fixing to get into we're fixing to
[1:28:08] get into the seals again
[1:28:10] the seals is what literally opened this
[1:28:13] book to all of us
[1:28:15] showed us all the Mysteries
[1:28:18] and those Mysteries was about me and you
[1:28:27] according to the good pleasure
[1:28:30] of his will
[1:28:32] my brother rounds right here we'll stop
[1:28:34] let's go ahead and stand our feet now
[1:28:36] what is adoption
[1:28:38] let me get this now I don't know whether
[1:28:40] I won't have time to get through this
[1:28:41] but I'll hit it
[1:28:43] we'll have time to hit it Wednesday
[1:28:44] night then if there's a question you can
[1:28:46] ask a little later
[1:28:48] your adoption is not your birth
[1:28:51] all right your birth is at Genesis 1 26
[1:28:54] man being put into
[1:28:57] flesh
[1:28:59] the old you burn out
[1:29:02] God coming in
[1:29:06] Vulcanizing himself to you the real you
[1:29:09] and then the real you shows
[1:29:15] whether it be of the devil or of God the
[1:29:17] real you is going to show
[1:29:20] your adoption is not your birth
[1:29:24] your adoption is your placing now we'll
[1:29:26] talk about that maybe Wednesday night or
[1:29:27] a little bit later because when we say
[1:29:29] placing by the way what do you mean
[1:29:32] You Know Who You Are
[1:29:34] you know why you're here you know where
[1:29:36] you're going you know why God speaks to
[1:29:39] you the way he does and not the other
[1:29:40] person
[1:29:43] because everybody's not coming to
[1:29:44] adoption
[1:29:46] not everybody is you're not going to be
[1:29:48] able to use the full word of God to your
[1:29:50] benefit
[1:29:51] and the only person that stops you is
[1:29:53] you
[1:29:57] we were predestinated
[1:30:00] unto
[1:30:02] this adoption for the sons of the last
[1:30:04] day that's us
[1:30:06] even brother Branham I didn't get to it
[1:30:08] but I'll read it Wednesday night where
[1:30:10] brother Brown stood one day on The Sixth
[1:30:12] Seal he'd preached he'd preached the
[1:30:13] seals up to up to the sixth ceiling he
[1:30:16] had questions and answers before the
[1:30:17] settlements he'll open or not you all
[1:30:18] know I've recorded many many times I had
[1:30:21] it on here
[1:30:23] he said it's gone from you
[1:30:28] in other words you have the spirit of
[1:30:30] adoption listen to me real I'm not
[1:30:32] degrading those people they came in the
[1:30:34] time they're supposed to be he said
[1:30:35] brother Brown says look you have
[1:30:37] received Christianity
[1:30:40] I have to get around here because
[1:30:42] Michael's so big
[1:30:43] you have received Christianity right
[1:30:46] he didn't de-christianize them
[1:30:48] but he said what I'm talking about this
[1:30:51] week is not for you
[1:30:55] it's for a group of people to come now
[1:30:58] he didn't say that but that's exactly if
[1:30:59] it wasn't for them it's got to be for
[1:31:01] somebody okay the word of God's Not
[1:31:03] Gonna return void when he spoke those
[1:31:05] seals something had to happen
[1:31:09] he had to be adopted number one
[1:31:12] and then he brought it to a people and
[1:31:14] then God showed him hey all these people
[1:31:16] are not going to be adopted because
[1:31:18] they're still Pentecostal they're babies
[1:31:21] there was no message churches in 1963.
[1:31:24] brother Brown was the only one that
[1:31:26] really believed what he said
[1:31:29] I'm telling you
[1:31:31] you look and say and you asked both
[1:31:33] George Smith
[1:31:34] when brother Brown died
[1:31:36] brother Banks woods and all the ones
[1:31:38] that he had spoke of Highly on the tape
[1:31:40] they went right back into their
[1:31:41] denomination
[1:31:44] Junior Jackson a couple of them you know
[1:31:46] kind of caught a little bit of it well
[1:31:47] then they went off into all kinds of
[1:31:49] stuff but that wasn't nobody
[1:31:51] that really got the Capstone or
[1:31:54] headstone message brother Ryan was
[1:31:56] talking about except another group of
[1:31:58] people
[1:31:59] which is us
[1:32:00] I just contend it's us Folk
[1:32:03] it's us he was talking about I don't
[1:32:05] know if he saw your face or my face in
[1:32:07] in that Vision but he knew that the
[1:32:09] vision he had of the people sitting in
[1:32:11] his congregation was not going to come
[1:32:12] to adoption they were not going to get
[1:32:14] it
[1:32:16] but it's for another group of people
[1:32:18] which is US amen foreign
[1:32:22] and that takes us to adoption and we'll
[1:32:23] start talking about Wednesday night but
[1:32:25] praise God we're in listen
[1:32:28] you don't get put in a group that's a
[1:32:30] good group to be put in
[1:32:32] the group that's gonna get it
[1:32:34] the group that's going to see this thing
[1:32:36] to the very end
[1:32:37] the group that look not just see it but
[1:32:39] be involved
[1:32:41] there's going to be somebody that's
[1:32:43] going to be involved with this adoption
[1:32:44] that's able to write their own check
[1:32:49] and it be exactly what God Said
[1:32:52] exactly what God was thinking
[1:32:57] he loves us even though sometimes we
[1:32:59] don't think like him
[1:33:01] but I think he really has a shout and
[1:33:02] fit when we catch a revelation of what
[1:33:05] he's already said
[1:33:07] and we say that ain't nothing but the
[1:33:08] truth
[1:33:09] and he goes that's my kids
[1:33:12] ask my kids they've grown up they've got
[1:33:15] they they adults they get in there
[1:33:17] they're eating the meat
[1:33:19] this hour
[1:33:21] is the greatest hour
[1:33:23] the greatest hour of Christianity since
[1:33:25] Jesus walked on the face of the earth is
[1:33:26] right now
[1:33:30] because it's a many-membered group of
[1:33:31] people that understood what brother
[1:33:33] Brown and brought
[1:33:35] is walking in what he said
[1:33:37] and is learning
[1:33:39] what the real word of God is and what it
[1:33:42] says
[1:33:43] because there's a lot of people don't
[1:33:44] they don't know that

[1:35:12] word of God
[1:35:15] that we'll be able to uh to believe it
[1:35:18] not just like I said not just leave it
[1:35:20] on the page but become it let it live
[1:35:23] let it come out and live live among us
[1:35:27] amen anybody ready
[1:35:33] Paul says for I have received of the
[1:35:34] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[1:35:36] you that the Lord Jesus the same night
[1:35:38] in which he was betrayed took bread
[1:35:40] and when he had given thanks he'd break
[1:35:42] it so take eat this is my body which is
[1:35:44] broken for you this do in remembrance
[1:35:47] of me
[1:35:49] after the same manner also he took the
[1:35:51] cup and when he had stopped saying this
[1:35:52] cup is a new testament in my blood
[1:35:55] this New Year's office you drink it in
[1:35:57] remembrance of me for as often as you
[1:35:59] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:36:01] show the Lord's death
[1:36:03] till he come
[1:36:05] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:36:08] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:36:10] unworthily
[1:36:12] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:36:15] the Lord but let a man examine himself
[1:36:17] and so letting me to that bread and
[1:36:19] drink of that cup
[1:36:20] for he that eat us and drinketh some
[1:36:22] worthily eat us and drink his damnation
[1:36:23] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[1:36:26] body for this cause many or weak and
[1:36:28] sickly among you I mean sleep
[1:36:31] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:36:32] should not be judged but when we are
[1:36:34] judged
[1:36:35] we are chasing of the Lord that we
[1:36:36] should not be condemned
[1:36:38] with this world wow wherefore my
[1:36:41] brethren when you come together to eat
[1:36:42] Terry
[1:36:44] one for another and if any man hunger
[1:36:45] let him eat at home let you come not
[1:36:47] together into condemnation and the rest
[1:36:49] will I said in order when I come you
[1:36:51] know Paul had come to a group of people
[1:36:53] in Corinth and they were just eating and
[1:36:56] drinking and having a party and it was
[1:36:58] just like you know having a feast and
[1:37:00] having a buffet and they were drinking
[1:37:02] wine and getting drunk and all these
[1:37:03] things and he said no don't do that
[1:37:05] hey should you go do that at home
[1:37:08] all right you don't do that at home you
[1:37:10] set aside a time that we're going to
[1:37:12] take communion to understand that it's
[1:37:15] the body and blood of the Lord
[1:37:17] all right so that's what Paul was
[1:37:19] telling him and say you know we had one
[1:37:22] Pastor our first Pastor he wasn't he
[1:37:24] said you don't supposed to eat after
[1:37:25] communion so we wouldn't go out and eat
[1:37:26] that Sunday
[1:37:28] I mean that's just that was his thought
[1:37:30] and it was okay but that's not what Paul
[1:37:32] was saying
[1:37:33] he was saying reverence the communion
[1:37:35] and then whatever you got to do go home
[1:37:37] and do it right
[1:37:39] he said in a restaurant I said in order
[1:37:41] when I come when he come back he said
[1:37:42] all this in order Paul did to the
[1:37:45] Corinthians he set him in order and told
[1:37:46] him this is what you're supposed to do
[1:37:48] you're supposed to take the bread that's
[1:37:49] not made with Unholy hands and take the
[1:37:52] wine that's not made with Unholy hands
[1:37:54] and he takes it and reverence my body
[1:37:56] which you know what represent the body
[1:37:58] of the Lord is is representing each
[1:38:00] other
[1:38:02] reversing each other we're the body of
[1:38:04] the Lord
[1:38:05] he has a physical body sure but it's up
[1:38:07] there
[1:38:08] or in another dimension I don't want to
[1:38:10] say up there it's in another dimension
[1:38:12] but you and I are his body on this Earth
[1:38:14] that's why we're going to tarry just for
[1:38:16] a moment clear everything out
[1:38:19] get everything clear
[1:38:21] now listen listen to me I've heard of
[1:38:24] people not taking communion because of
[1:38:25] some little something brother Brown said
[1:38:27] clear yourself out if you have to make
[1:38:30] it right you can't break it make it
[1:38:32] right right then you go and take
[1:38:34] communion that's what he said
[1:38:36] amen then you but you better go make
[1:38:39] that right because you know what you're
[1:38:41] going to eat a little damn Nation what
[1:38:43] that's what that means if you don't
[1:38:44] continue and do what you're supposed to
[1:38:46] do
[1:38:47] because this is this is to me this is
[1:38:50] sacred
[1:38:51] but we're humans we walk in here today
[1:38:53] and we got all kind of problems you may
[1:38:54] have spoke you know
[1:38:56] to your wife Crossways or sideways or
[1:39:00] your kids or something but
[1:39:02] clear that out today and say God I'm
[1:39:04] sorry I'm human
[1:39:05] I want to take this communion because I
[1:39:07] want to commemorate you dying for me
[1:39:10] and I want to commune closer to you
[1:39:13] so I'm going to make that right over
[1:39:15] here
[1:39:16] but you better go make it right
[1:39:18] all right but take that communion all
[1:39:21] right then go make it right
[1:39:24] are you eating drink damnation and it
[1:39:26] says maybe sometimes people even sleep
[1:39:28] because of it
[1:39:30] to Heavenly Father Lord this bread we
[1:39:31] know has been made with holy hands and
[1:39:33] father we pray that you would Sanctified
[1:39:34] Lord our bodies thank you for giving us
[1:39:37] this opportunity to do this Lord and be
[1:39:39] standing in front of your people Lord

[1:39:44] now being manifest in a group called The
[1:39:46] Bride thank you for that father and
[1:39:48] thank you for all this that we have in
[1:39:49] Jesus name amen
[1:39:57] and just to let you know I've got the
[1:39:59] grape smashed
[1:40:01] they're in
[1:40:04] nine gallon jars nine they're in no
[1:40:07] three three gallon jars and they're
[1:40:09] working so let's pray that that
[1:40:10] communion wine
[1:40:12] we can make it like brother Dale does
[1:40:23] used to a gallon of communion wine would
[1:40:24] last us for a long time but not anymore
[1:40:26] and I praise God for that I hope we have
[1:40:29] to make one a gallon every week or every
[1:40:31] month I mean
[1:40:33] that means you're taking communion and
[1:40:35] not passing it by
[1:40:46] but you know God just gave us a few
[1:40:48] ordinances to do
[1:40:49] take communion keep yourself clean take
[1:40:51] communion foot washing and baptized in
[1:40:54] my name
[1:40:55] that's kind of pretty much all he give
[1:40:57] us those ordinances he said here if
[1:40:59] you'll do these you're good
[1:41:03] now we know there's a lot of them to go
[1:41:04] to it but he told us those were
[1:41:05] important right those were important the
[1:41:07] important ones
[1:41:08] because if you don't if you don't take
[1:41:09] communion
[1:41:11] you're not doing what the word of the
[1:41:12] Lord says like I said with water baptism
[1:41:14] and and even with the washing feet
[1:41:17] he said you do this till I come
[1:41:19] to Heavenly Father thank you for this
[1:41:20] wine Lord
[1:41:22] it's been made probably a year or more
[1:41:24] ago but it's just as good now as it was
[1:41:26] then Lauren because the holy spirit is
[1:41:28] just as good now as it was many many
[1:41:31] years ago Lord I pray that as we take
[1:41:33] these to our lips Lord that it'll
[1:41:35] refresh us
[1:41:36] and it will help us to understand Lord
[1:41:39] that you're you're not just near us
[1:41:41] you're in US and you're here Lord to
[1:41:44] heal to save Lord we have seen people
[1:41:48] healed taking this communion Lord I pray
[1:41:50] that you'd bless it Lord as it goes to
[1:41:53] our bodies Lord and sanctifies Lord for
[1:41:56] this journey as we continue on
[1:41:58] as we touch this glass
[1:42:01] Lord we remember brother Dale
[1:42:04] the one that made this
[1:42:06] and Lord the years that he stood here
[1:42:10] and had this church in order
[1:42:12] with a communion of foot washing not
[1:42:14] having to buy wine from outside and and
[1:42:16] pray over it and sanctify but made it
[1:42:19] for his own congregation
[1:42:21] from his own hands him and Mom Lord I
[1:42:24] pray that you'd bless him now touch him
[1:42:26] as we take this communion Lord
[1:42:28] that you'll go to that hospital
[1:42:31] and that you'll touch his body Lord and
[1:42:34] his mind that he'll think straight Lord
[1:42:36] and that his body will come to come
[1:42:39] under subjection Lord and not be a
[1:42:42] little agitated with the nurses or with
[1:42:44] us or anyone else Lord I pray that you
[1:42:47] would touch him Lord he stood for you
[1:42:49] now we're standing for him
[1:42:51] Lord I pray that you'd bless him in
[1:42:53] Jesus name amen
[1:42:56] come morning
[1:42:58] I'll walk
[1:43:00] by the river
[1:43:03] our rest needs he ever Greentree
[1:43:11] I will carry my cross
[1:43:15] through the midnight
[1:43:19] come morning there's glory for me
[1:43:26] sometimes I'm despised
[1:43:30] and rejected
[1:43:33] and I question oh Father
[1:43:38] how long
[1:43:41] then I take one more look
[1:43:45] at Mount Calvary
[1:43:48] and it gives me the strength to
[1:43:53] go on
[1:43:56] good morning I'll walk
[1:43:59] by the river what a refreshing time
[1:44:03] all right I'll rest in the
[1:44:07] evergreen tree
[1:44:10] how carry my cross
[1:44:15] through the midnight
[1:44:18] but come morning
[1:44:20] there's Glory
[1:44:23] for me
[1:44:25] rest
[1:44:28] will rest
[1:44:30] I mean even when we rest now as humans
[1:44:33] we're not resting
[1:44:34] our body's going 100 miles an hour and
[1:44:37] our brain's running a thousand miles an
[1:44:39] hour
[1:44:40] about tomorrow about the next day about
[1:44:42] this about that worried about the kids
[1:44:44] worried about this worried about that
[1:44:46] but when God tells us to rest
[1:44:50] he means it
[1:44:53] brother how
[1:44:54] is at rest
[1:44:57] last time I saw him
[1:44:58] he he you could see the burdens on his
[1:45:01] face
[1:45:03] but but even laying there in in the
[1:45:05] casket
[1:45:07] he almost looked Young
[1:45:10] the burdens and the cares were away from
[1:45:12] from whatever was you know burdening his
[1:45:14] his mind
[1:45:16] and and burdening him you know being a
[1:45:18] burden to the family and and you know
[1:45:21] that weight on him
[1:45:23] remember what he did didn't he brother
[1:45:25] boy he looked he looked really refreshed
[1:45:27] even laying in the casket I know they
[1:45:29] make them up but still you can you know
[1:45:31] um
[1:45:33] somebody was here not too long ago and
[1:45:35] said they knew a mortician and a
[1:45:36] mortician they don't call them
[1:45:38] morticians anymore I don't know what
[1:45:39] they call them but Funeral Directors
[1:45:42] but a funeral director told him one time
[1:45:44] said we can so when people bring bodies
[1:45:46] in he said we can really tell whether
[1:45:49] they're Christians or not
[1:45:51] he said if you're a Christian they're
[1:45:53] just they're just
[1:45:54] everything's peaceful
[1:45:56] he said but people that screaming crying
[1:45:59] you know horrible horrible deaths he
[1:46:02] said they're all contorted and their
[1:46:04] skin is all mashed together
[1:46:08] because they're fighting
[1:46:10] when you come to the end of your time
[1:46:12] you better hope one thing's for sure
[1:46:14] you know that you know that you know you
[1:46:17] know where you're going
[1:46:21] because it would be a horrible thing if
[1:46:22] you didn't
[1:46:25] thank you brother
[1:46:30] [Music]
[1:46:41] thank you
[1:46:44] hitting there a piece being a Christian
[1:46:46] I mean sure we have struggles and trials
[1:46:48] but
[1:46:49] that there's a Prince of Peace in there
[1:46:51] somewhere
[1:46:52] you need to let him out
[1:46:54] have peaceful yourself peaceful your
[1:46:56] brother
[1:46:58] peace with the Lord let's partake God
[1:47:00] bless you
[1:47:13] let's read the scripture while they're
[1:47:14] taking that up for the
[1:47:16] put the foot washing
[1:47:18] hmm
[1:47:20] I hope my I hope the one we make as good
[1:47:22] as that for sure
[1:47:25] that is good wine I mean but you know I
[1:47:27] honestly I see when I go to places and
[1:47:30] preach and used to a good bit more than
[1:47:33] now
[1:47:33] they always would have a
[1:47:36] a bottle of wine they bought from the
[1:47:38] store because they had no way to make it
[1:47:39] they didn't know anything about making
[1:47:41] it they would buy it from the store and
[1:47:43] it's got all kind of yeast and all kinds
[1:47:45] of preservatives in it
[1:47:48] that's nothing more to what I'm making
[1:47:51] the same way what Dad made on from the
[1:47:53] same recipe that's nothing but sugar and
[1:47:55] grapes that's it the sugar makes it work
[1:47:58] then you just keep straining the grapes
[1:48:00] and then whatever the whatever that
[1:48:03] chemical reaction is we opened some up
[1:48:06] last night me and Mom didn't open some
[1:48:07] of the jars up
[1:48:09] and you can see it working
[1:48:11] you see it start bubbling
[1:48:14] I wish the Holy Ghost would work like
[1:48:16] that maybe give you a little bubble
[1:48:19] maybe somebody would do this every once
[1:48:21] in a while
[1:48:24] act like you want to be here
[1:48:27] okay
[1:48:30] natural Times Are Spiritual why do we
[1:48:32] take wine instead of grape juice grape
[1:48:34] juice sours and goes bad
[1:48:37] and ain't no telling who made it
[1:48:39] but the church is what they do is they
[1:48:41] just tell me they pray over it they get
[1:48:42] the deacons and the preachers together
[1:48:43] and they pray over the wine that they
[1:48:45] have to buy because they don't have now
[1:48:47] dad has we have never in this church
[1:48:49] since 1975 that I know of ever had to
[1:48:52] buy anyone
[1:48:53] tell you know for we never had to buy
[1:48:56] never had to go out and buy any dad and
[1:48:58] mom's always made it
[1:49:00] and we appreciate that and you think
[1:49:01] well that that's just that's just being
[1:49:03] technical no it's supposed to be made by
[1:49:05] holy hands
[1:49:07] they're supposed to be the fruit of the
[1:49:09] vine all right not the grape juice
[1:49:12] all right it needs to be made with holy
[1:49:14] hands
[1:49:15] and then I think maybe that helps you a
[1:49:18] little bit more
[1:49:19] all right so let's go to the foot
[1:49:20] washing
[1:49:21] supper being ended the devil having now
[1:49:23] put it in the heart of Judas this carrot
[1:49:25] Solomon's son to betray him Jesus
[1:49:27] knowing that the father had given all
[1:49:28] things into his hands and he was come
[1:49:30] from God boy we ought to get that
[1:49:31] revelation after today
[1:49:33] we come from God and we're going back to
[1:49:36] God all right
[1:49:37] he rises from supper and laid aside his
[1:49:39] garments and took a towel and girded
[1:49:41] himself and after that he poured water
[1:49:42] into a basin and began to wash the
[1:49:44] disciples feet and to wipe them with a
[1:49:45] towel or with he was girded then cometh
[1:49:48] heed to Simon Peter and Peter saying to
[1:49:50] him Lord here's Peter Lord Dost thou
[1:49:53] wash my feet Jesus said what I do thou
[1:49:56] knowest not now Peter you will know
[1:49:59] Hereafter and you will institute this
[1:50:02] everywhere you go you're going to wash
[1:50:03] feet
[1:50:04] go back I'm not finished reading that
[1:50:07] other one Jesus answered and said what I
[1:50:09] do that I know it's not now but Thou
[1:50:10] shalt know her after all right you'll
[1:50:12] know Hereafter Peter said
[1:50:15] Peter couldn't wait because we said no
[1:50:18] he ain't watching my feet
[1:50:19] Jesus said if I wash thee not see this
[1:50:22] is so powerful he said if I don't wash
[1:50:23] your feet you'll have no part with me
[1:50:26] okay Simon Peter says unto him Lord not
[1:50:28] my feet only but also my hands and my
[1:50:31] head
[1:50:31] Jesus said unto him he that is washed
[1:50:34] and he is not saved to wash his feet but
[1:50:35] is clean ever with and you are clean but
[1:50:38] not all for he knew who should betray
[1:50:40] him therefore he said you're not all
[1:50:42] clean so after he washed their feet and
[1:50:45] taken garment will sit down again he
[1:50:47] said unto them know you what I've done
[1:50:48] to you he's asked him a question
[1:50:50] you know what I'm doing to you you call
[1:50:53] me master and Lord and you say well for
[1:50:54] so I am
[1:50:55] if I then your Lord and Master have
[1:50:57] washed your feet
[1:50:59] you also ought to wash one another's
[1:51:00] feet
[1:51:01] for I have given you an example in other
[1:51:04] words an ordinance I've given you an
[1:51:05] example that you should do as I have
