[6:02] remember brother Bob he's away preaching
[6:04] for the weekend over at Blue Ridge there
[6:06] for them or not you Blue Ridge I guess
[6:09] we call that Blue Ridge Church because
[6:11] it's always been that and I'll just
[6:13] remember that and I know that you've
[6:15] heard it so remember to pray for the
[6:18] prash family there in India cuz brother
[6:20] pash's wife passed away yesterday they
[6:23] thought it was a heart attack they don't
[6:25] know for sure but I talked with Samuel
[6:27] this morning and and and he uh said that
[6:31] that's what they believed it was but
[6:33] just remember the family oh that's you
[6:35] know the passing of his wife and
[6:37] everything she'd been sick we've been
[6:39] praying for her for quite a while but

[7:01] seemed to be real up so praise the Lord
[7:04] he said he was on the men and he was
[7:07] going to keep on going so that he said
[7:10] he could walk better said he still had a
[7:12] little limp but that'd be taken care of
[7:14] but then he still having a little
[7:16] problems with his hand but that'll also
[7:18] be taken care of the Lord will make him
[7:21] to be that all right and remember
[7:23] brother Claude weinger will be with us

[7:29] remember the Bible study will be the

[7:33] Romans 1 to just start on it and kind of
[7:37] go through the scriptures and talk on
[7:38] them come and be with us but then we're
[7:41] going to have the uh get together on
[7:43] what the 12th of April so remember that
[7:48] and uh you know that the Lord would be
[7:50] with us and that's make sure you sign up
[7:54] downstairs to come in because we got to

[7:58] the refrigerator brother Al uh he's
[8:00] always gracious to make us some good old
[8:02] chili so we'll we'll get him the meat

[8:07] that but anything you want to bring you

[8:12] we have hot dogs and stuff you know and
[8:15] all anything you want to bring
[8:16] especially in the line of sweets you

[8:20] are we uh we we we love our sweets so uh
[8:24] if you want to do that's fine but make
[8:26] sure now cuz it'll still be cool make

[8:34] boys and things and bring kids bring
[8:37] your gloves and bats and balls and
[8:40] everything we get together and we have a
[8:41] good time playing and doing that okay
[8:45] remember that before you're seated I
[8:46] want to read what and I I'll give it to
[8:49] the brother uh Brother Anderson if
[8:52] you'll pull it up I made a statement
[8:54] Wednesday night and I said I'll read it
[8:55] Sunday morning because I didn't have it
[8:58] I made it a little offline but it's
[9:01] close uh statue of perfect
[9:05] man paragraph
[9:07] 400 and run on up to 400 because you can
[9:10] get what he's talking about the Catholic
[9:12] Church running everything and how that
[9:14] the the world is on a gold standard and
[9:16] the church owns the the Catholic Church
[9:18] owns the gold of the world and and all
[9:21] like that and look what he says and
[9:23] throw her right back on the gold
[9:25] standard you people just keep your homes
[9:28] and things
[9:29] but you belong to the Catholic
[9:32] church now I said take the mark of the
[9:35] beast or something like that but to me
[9:36] it'd be the same thing but that's still
[9:38] not what he said so I'm making sure to
[9:40] correct he said this the nation belongs
[9:43] to the Catholic Church the whole thing
[9:44] is captured right in like that through
[9:47] their currency don't the Bible speak of
[9:50] that that's the picture that the Bible
[9:52] draws out so I wanted to give you that
[9:55] you say well what does that
[9:57] mean uh what he he
[10:00] said that uh you know you can say well
[10:03] do I need to get rid of my house well he
[10:07] he didn't get rid of his you know he
[10:09] lived in a house and and uh he said one
[10:12] time he said if you knew what your
[10:14] something paraphrasing it what you had
[10:15] in your pocket you take it out and burn
[10:17] it well you know what he didn't burn
[10:19] it right I mean he kept run on with his
[10:22] money in his pocket and and the things
[10:24] and and he knew but the main thing to me
[10:28] is
[10:30] is it comes down to a
[10:33] line and you got a choice that's right
[10:36] and it's going to be offered to us to
[10:38] join up with the World Church
[10:42] systems and we will refuse to join up
[10:45] with it and when we do we will lose all
[10:48] rights here we know that we just that's
[10:50] fine and I have no problems with it but
[10:53] it it'll come down to where that like he
[10:55] said you just keep your homes cuz
[10:57] everything's going to belong to the
[10:58] cathol cic church and that's that's the
[11:01] way it's got to be that's the Bible and
[11:03] no problem that's uh you know uh it's
[11:06] not we're not going to go out and sell
[11:08] our
[11:09] homes you know but that's you know you
[11:12] just uh he said if you're planting
[11:15] potatoes keep planting potatoes you know
[11:17] somebody need to eat the potatoes I've
[11:20] always said about my family they think
[11:22] I'm an idiot a nut crazy
[11:25] stupid and ugly but they know that I'm
[11:29] not totally dumb and I figure that the
[11:32] day comes we come up missing then they
[11:35] need some food they'll try to come to
[11:37] our home to find out something I just
[11:39] believe that you know because they know
[11:41] and realize what's going on and maybe
[11:43] that day their eyes will be open to see
[11:46] what we've tried to say to the world and
[11:49] the things but not to be so
[11:52] dogmatic that you can't do this or you
[11:55] can't do that you know it's not uh it's
[11:58] not that what all right so just that way
[12:00] and not trying to interpret that just
[12:02] give you what he said and and let it
[12:05] remain at that situation let's see if I
[12:08] got all the announcements out so make
[12:10] sure now that some of them last time uh
[12:13] we were sitting around a campfire and
[12:14] you didn't have no coats and things so
[12:17] if I was you I'd make sure and put in
[12:18] one you know and a hat and a scarf for
[12:21] your sisters you know and I don't mind
[12:24] you wearing a hat that day to keep your
[12:26] head warm you know cuz you need it
[12:28] that's just sensible but do that
[12:31] okay we're going into the scriptures in
[12:36] um Matthew 16 and then we'll go to Luke
[12:41] 177 Heavenly Father we thank you for
[12:43] this day in your grace unto us and your
[12:45] love unto us thank you for Calvary
[12:48] because the Earth where it was all made
[12:49] possible you made everything right for
[12:52] all of us you've given all of us an
[12:55] opportunity and we just ask you to guide
[12:58] us
[12:59] forgive our sins cleanse us and keep us
[13:01] Lord and whatever the day comes upon us
[13:05] we know that you will have us prepared
[13:07] for that day and we don't have to worry
[13:09] because we're resting in you we love you
[13:12] and we thank you Father bless us as we
[13:14] read your word you come and speak to our
[13:16] hearts in Jesus
[13:18] name Matthew 16 very familiar with all
[13:22] of
[13:23] us verse 13 when Jesus came into the
[13:26] coast of cesaria Philippi he asked his
[13:29] disciples saying whom do men say that I
[13:34] the son of man am you remember he always
[13:36] referred to himself as son of
[13:38] man because that was the dispensation
[13:42] right and they said some say th are John
[13:47] the Baptist some Elias and others
[13:51] jeremias are one of the prophets now
[13:52] when they say thou art John the Baptist
[13:56] uh that was writing see after John the
[13:59] Baptist had come the writings of the
[14:01] Bible was 50 years uh ad50 somewhere
[14:04] which would have been uh 17 years after
[14:09] uh this situation so it's not meaning
[14:11] that some say you're John the
[14:14] Baptist they was actually if you'd read
[14:16] it in originals and things you'd find
[14:18] out they were saying th art this one
[14:20] that was expected to come from Elijah
[14:23] you know in in the doings all right just
[14:26] to throw a little talk to it all right
[14:29] some Elias and others jeremias are one
[14:31] of the prophets and he sath unto them
[14:34] whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter
[14:39] answered and said Thou Art the Christ
[14:42] the son of the Living God Jesus answered
[14:45] and said unto him blessed art thou Simon
[14:47] bar Jonas for Flesh and Blood hath not
[14:50] revealed it unto thee but my Father
[14:53] which is in heaven who's who's the
[14:55] revealer only revealer of the word and I
[14:59] say unto thee that thou art Peter Upon
[15:01] This Rock I'll build my church and the
[15:03] Gates of Hell shall Prevail shall not
[15:05] Prevail against it all right let's drop
[15:07] over to Luke
[15:09] 17 verse
[15:13] 20 and when he was demanded of the
[15:16] Pharisees when the kingdom of God should
[15:19] come he answered them and
[15:22] said the kingdom of God cometh not with
[15:25] observation now the kingdom of God is is
[15:27] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that would
[15:29] come on the day of Pentecost right so
[15:31] we're in the right order neither shall
[15:33] they say loow here or low there for
[15:35] behold the kingdom of God is within you
[15:39] it was in him then now it's in Us by the
[15:41] new birth right all right and he said
[15:44] unto the disciples the days will come
[15:47] when you shall desire to see the days of
[15:50] the son of man speaking of a future
[15:53] event right the days will
[15:57] come all right
[15:59] that they will
[16:01] what that she shall not see it all right
[16:05] and they shall say to you see here or
[16:07] see there go not after them nor follow
[16:10] them for as the lightning that
[16:13] lith out of the one part of part under
[16:17] Heaven shineth unto the other part under
[16:20] heaven so shall also the son of man be
[16:23] in his
[16:24] day so he's evidently pointing future
[16:27] right right
[16:30] okay but first must he suffer many
[16:33] things and be rejected of this
[16:35] generation
[16:37] right and as it was in the days of Noah
[16:41] so shall it be also in the days of the
[16:44] son of
[16:45] man they did eat they drank they married
[16:49] wives they were given in marriage until
[16:51] the day that Noah entered into the ark
[16:53] now give it an example right of how it
[16:56] would be and the flood came and
[16:58] destroyed them all likewise also as it
[17:01] was in the days of lot they did eat they
[17:03] drank they bought they sold they planted
[17:05] they build it but the same day that lot
[17:08] went out of Sodom it rained fire and
[17:10] brimstone from heaven and destroyed them
[17:14] even thus shall it
[17:16] be in the day see future time right when
[17:21] the son of man is revealed okay you may
[17:26] be seated the Lord had his blessing to
[17:29] the reading of the word now I know that
[17:31] goes on to speak of and it did take
[17:35] place with
[17:37] Titus in ad70 when he surrounded
[17:40] Jerusalem Etc but the point is that it's
[17:44] Jesus Christ speaking of a future
[17:48] event all right let's give these out now
[17:53] what I've done on the last couple of
[17:54] messages I want to give you the
[17:56] opportunity to be able able to read what
[17:59] the prophet says and there's plenty more
[18:02] but yet these are are Choice ones for
[18:05] you to read and keep these and that way
[18:08] you can compare and somebody says what
[18:10] do y'all believe about the Bride of
[18:12] Jesus Christ I've heard y'all believe
[18:14] it'll be the fullness of the godhead
[18:16] bodily well I've explained that it takes
[18:19] the all entire
[18:21] bride not just the end time to be the
[18:24] fullness of the godhead bodily all right
[18:27] so then it brings everybody into view
[18:29] okay now then say well what do you
[18:32] believe about this here of dispensations
[18:35] well we believe in a dispensation of you
[18:39] know to be and and a dispensation of the
[18:44] Holy Ghost down through the church
[18:46] ages and then a dispensation of the son
[18:49] of man all right now you say well what
[18:52] about this son of man is that not just
[18:55] brother brandham well we'll read in a
[18:56] little bit I'm giving you these where he
[18:58] said I am not the son of man I am not
[19:02] the anointed son of
[19:04] man he said I must a son of man all
[19:08] right so then we believe and thank God
[19:10] because none of us would have an
[19:12] opportunity to understand the
[19:15] Bible had it not been that God kept his
[19:18] word of Malachi 4 and these things and
[19:21] the day of Luke 17:30 when it would be
[19:25] uh you know the revealed and and where
[19:28] everything would would come forth all
[19:31] right and then they'd say well what do
[19:32] you believe about cuz we've heard uh
[19:35] back in the 80s they begin to preach on
[19:38] the son of man and said what do you
[19:41] believe about that son of man well you
[19:43] know I've told you I don't believe it's
[19:45] brother brandom I believe that that the
[19:47] son the son of man is the Lord Jesus
[19:50] Christ all right now what we're dealing
[19:53] with is where that son of man is to be
[19:55] made manifest we've come through the the
[19:58] days of where the Prophet was here and
[20:01] brought the message unto us and God was
[20:04] there with him in the resurrection sign
[20:06] which would relate back to son of man
[20:09] because that was what the son of man had
[20:12] was the resurrection sign all power
[20:14] things was given unto him see and he
[20:16] could raise the dead well then we come
[20:18] on over to see you know God raising the
[20:21] dead in the last days and proving that
[20:25] the word was right we were listening to
[20:28] to a message the other night I meant to
[20:29] write it down but you know I just didn't
[20:32] but see I I'll
[20:35] paraphrase you know the
[20:37] point uh we think that we've got to be
[20:41] into certain signs and wonders in the
[20:43] last days and I believe in it and I
[20:46] believe that we want God more Among Us
[20:48] than ever before I believe that I'm
[20:50] looking forward to that but don't deny
[20:54] what he's doing or been doing all right
[20:57] see because if you do that then you
[20:59] would never see what would be coming cuz
[21:01] if we're not prepared if we didn't eat
[21:03] as babies and grow up we wouldn't be
[21:06] here as adults that's just plain
[21:08] sensible all right so then you know to
[21:12] see it then the prophet even said as we
[21:16] gave it there that that that God
[21:19] wouldn't complete without
[21:21] you well now he's the one that said that
[21:25] you know I mean God said that
[21:28] all right so then let's accept what it
[21:31] is now and look and seek after God to
[21:36] unveil his word but now here's my
[21:39] point are we to put the emphasis in this
[21:43] last
[21:44] days and I'm just asking you to think
[21:46] with me you know what I preached for 40
[21:50] years some of you and and you know
[21:53] that's what I just laid down we thank
[21:55] God for the prophet all right with
[21:58] without that you and I wouldn't be
[21:59] anything that's right okay but I think
[22:02] it's time to move on not move off of
[22:06] what the prophet says but to move on in
[22:08] what he said all right then in doing
[22:11] that are we to go back and find signs
[22:13] and wonders to have a
[22:18] Vindication and we believe in that but
[22:21] remember they have signs and wonders out
[22:24] there the sick is being healed the
[22:27] things are happening
[22:28] in the denominational reals all right
[22:31] what are we going to put that on I
[22:32] remember this happened now this is a
[22:34] story related to
[22:36] me that
[22:38] after uh brother Randon passed on some
[22:41] of the brothers got together because
[22:42] they was a brother that had signs and
[22:44] wonders and I can't remember his name
[22:47] but I would not even call it anyway but
[22:50] some of them went to visit him in his
[22:53] ministry some of the Believers in this
[22:55] message all right because are the signs
[22:58] and
[22:59] wonders that was taking place all
[23:02] right but I've always been this way the
[23:05] signs and wonders is wonderful I believe
[23:07] in them but remember the spirit of God
[23:10] is poured out upon All Flesh okay now
[23:13] signs and wonders out there how many
[23:15] times have you heard me make this
[23:16] statement I said there will even come a
[23:19] time when the Baptist and Methodist and
[23:21] Presbyterians Etc This is 40 years ago
[23:24] would be having signs and wonders among
[23:27] them amen now that's on Tape 40 years
[23:30] ago cuz I believed it but I also said
[23:32] then I said you will also find that
[23:35] they'll be saying well we must be of God
[23:37] cuz look what's happening among us all
[23:40] right you can't go out there and talk to
[23:42] the denominations today about signs and
[23:44] wonders cuz they'll quote you somewhere
[23:47] one of their churches has got it going
[23:49] on all right now bring it on down into
[23:52] the message I said this I said there'll
[23:55] come a time when signs and wonders will
[23:57] come among
[23:58] the what we call the bride real right
[24:01] and that the the the two Soul people the
[24:04] two Lords the doctrines and things the
[24:07] spirit of God is poured out upon all
[24:09] people and if the denominations move up
[24:12] to where that they will be having signs
[24:14] and wonders would not there be signs and
[24:16] wonders among the what we call the bride
[24:20] all right but they'll be saying we must
[24:22] be right because look what's
[24:24] happening well now do we have to take
[24:27] that as a
[24:28] uh nail down what do you call those big
[24:31] old words uh you know I mean we put it
[24:34] on that or what are we to put the end
[24:37] time
[24:39] on remember the Bible says cuz there's
[24:43] two quotes there in the Bible one of
[24:44] them says if a prophet give you a sign
[24:46] or tell you you got to follow him
[24:49] because God has sent him that's right
[24:51] but there's another scripture that says
[24:54] if a man comes or Prophet comes gives
[24:56] you a sign and the sign come to
[25:00] pass but he takes you to another
[25:03] God don't believe him because I sent
[25:06] that among you to try
[25:08] you is that paraphrasing a lot of
[25:10] scripture putting it together all right
[25:13] so then you know don't you think it's
[25:17] the time to for us to deal on one thing
[25:22] that we've always been ridiculed at Lula
[25:24] about because everybody says y'all are
[25:26] just word word word word word word word
[25:28] word
[25:29] word well I wholeheartedly differ with
[25:32] you now listen to my point we are word
[25:35] word word because that's what we've been
[25:37] built on but I differ with you about
[25:39] this thinking that things ain't been
[25:40] going
[25:41] on I can stand here and talk through an
[25:44] hour about the healings of this body I
[25:47] can talk to you about my blood type
[25:48] totally changed by medical proof on
[25:51] their own records my blood type was
[25:53] changed from a positive to a negative by
[25:56] their own record records the doctor told
[25:59] me to take my kneecap off years ago he
[26:01] said it's worn slap out that was in the
[26:03] day when you had the straight lagged
[26:05] deal you know you didn't have all this
[26:07] modern stuff and I laughed and said you
[26:09] won't take it off I still got my knees
[26:12] you want to walk a little bit when we
[26:13] get through these brothers always say oh
[26:16] papa work you to death we were down at
[26:19] the hunting land yesterday picking up
[26:20] the deer stands and and we were all
[26:23] doing our job and I was running up and
[26:25] down them stands as well as the rest of
[26:26] them taking them off the tree and and
[26:28] everything else I'm just saying we've
[26:30] seen the dead
[26:33] raised we've seen the sick healed we've
[26:35] seen storms spoke out of existence we've
[26:38] seen rain come at the voice of people
[26:41] who call for
[26:43] it that's the point that I'm trying to
[26:45] make don't deny
[26:48] that take that as a foundation and then
[26:51] what comes when the signs and wonders
[26:53] come well I don't know where well
[26:56] they're having signs and wonders over
[26:57] our them denomination reck want to go
[26:59] over
[27:00] there well then that means you don't
[27:02] know what's going
[27:05] on what if God allows it to be I didn't
[27:08] mean to bring this but I'll get it what
[27:11] if God allowed it to be that it would be
[27:13] those things that would try you and I to
[27:15] see where we'd stay with the word or not
[27:18] cuz what else can we go
[27:20] by that brother up there he's got signs
[27:23] and wonders but he's he's a little off
[27:26] that's what a lady told my wife one time
[27:28] about a man over in India said he's he
[27:31] he's supposed to be
[27:33] God my wife just asked her a simple
[27:35] question said does he believe everything
[27:38] brother random taught said well no no he
[27:40] don't believe all of it he's got a few
[27:42] things he don't believe she said forget
[27:45] it that's not of God not that God don't
[27:49] allow that to happen among us but what
[27:52] are you and I to be based
[27:56] on the word
[27:59] now the prophet I didn't say he said the
[28:02] bride would vindicate Malachi 4
[28:04] vindicate Luke 1730 vindicate
[28:06] Revelations
[28:08] 10:7 what is to vindicate well bring
[28:11] them up here and let's raise couple of
[28:13] dead and world of believers they ain't
[28:15] going to believe you if you raise 40
[28:16] from the dead you think they're going to
[28:19] change their Doctrine because of a dead
[28:21] race I
[28:23] wouldn't and I don't blame them because
[28:26] they don't right you understand what I
[28:28] mean if a man give you a sign and he
[28:30] says the Dead's going to be raised and
[28:32] here it is you think I'm going to say
[28:35] okay uh where are you in the word well I
[28:38] don't believe William Brandon was the
[28:40] prophet end time he was a little all
[28:42] here and a little all well what are you
[28:43] quoting him
[28:46] for that's right right I mean he's a
[28:50] little off he's the worst Antichrist
[28:52] there
[28:54] is right that's right well I got okay go
[28:57] ahead but that's just my
[29:00] point let's take what we
[29:03] got and let's Mar forward
[29:07] am in the revealed word we've been doing
[29:09] it for 40 something years here why
[29:11] change now run after some signer Wonder
[29:14] that's right a no problem with checking
[29:16] them
[29:19] out but how many denominations today's
[29:21] got signs and wonders what are you going
[29:24] to
[29:26] do
[29:28] well brother so and so and them they had
[29:30] a service up there in their church and
[29:33] they stood for 13 hours and
[29:37] worship that's been done in this
[29:41] message praise the
[29:44] Lord but what did it finish up with the
[29:47] same Doctrine can I make a quote from
[29:50] the
[29:50] prophet he said it don't matter what
[29:53] signs and wonders I'm paraphrasing so I
[29:55] may miss it there don't matter what the
[29:57] signs and wonders for he said if it goes
[29:59] back to the same old
[30:04] message
[30:05] okay now that's where I stand that's my
[30:09] point is to stand on the revealed word
[30:13] amen and thank God for it and for signs
[30:17] and wonders among us thank God for
[30:21] it but signs and wonders amongst them
[30:24] thank God for it when the Beatles
[30:27] prayed for people they were healed
[30:30] that's right did the Beatles heal them
[30:32] no the pope prays for people and they're
[30:35] healed did he heal them no when Lula
[30:38] prays for the people and when they're
[30:40] healed do they heal them
[30:42] no when brother random prayed for the
[30:45] people and they were healed did Brother
[30:46] random heal them
[30:48] no we give God the
[30:53] glory all the
[30:56] way there's nothing in you and I worth
[30:58] anything that's right but why can't we
[31:01] stand on what we
[31:04] got because it's going to get
[31:06] deceiving I told you 40 years ago that
[31:10] the doctrines back then of the two Souls
[31:12] the two Lords or doctor I said they're
[31:14] not deceiving because they can't even
[31:16] quote the Bible
[31:17] correct I had a man the other day I said
[31:20] you got your computer would you look up
[31:22] a
[31:26] quote I said they say that brother
[31:28] randam said the the two Soul people you
[31:30] know quoting says that the soul is just
[31:33] the nature of the spirit I said run it
[31:34] in you computer and find that
[31:36] quote he run it in he said it's zero and
[31:39] you're exactly right brother brand said
[31:42] it the soul is not just the nature of
[31:44] the spirit he said the soul is the
[31:46] nature of the spirit well that don't
[31:48] change
[31:50] much I thought it was one word oh my
[31:54] that's right I that's all my
[31:56] understanding
[31:58] now cuz when you say just the nature of
[32:01] spirit you mean it's not worth nothing
[32:03] it's just just a a dog is just the
[32:05] nature of a dog cat's the nature of a
[32:07] cat it's just a nature no the soul is
[32:11] the real you amen it's not just a nature
[32:14] of
[32:16] something it's you am all right but you
[32:19] see that's word that I don't I
[32:21] don't fit in I guess and that's all
[32:24] right I'm
[32:25] sorry I pray all the time I cry all the
[32:28] time about things and pray
[32:31] Lord you know help
[32:34] me to get myself out of the
[32:37] way that I can be used no matter if I'm
[32:39] a cast away right but for my people
[32:43] Lord let me get myself out of the way
[32:46] and just keep bringing the
[32:49] word Lord I believe
[32:51] it now if I'm saying what brother
[32:53] Brandon
[32:55] said I know saying what brother Brown
[32:57] said is not going to convert anybody I
[32:59] just got to explaining that I believe
[33:02] everything brother Brown says there's
[33:05] people hollering at today and screaming
[33:07] sitting down in not just in Georgia all
[33:09] over the country sitting in churches
[33:11] playing
[33:13] tapes right when he said and the Bible
[33:17] says forsake not to assembly well we're
[33:20] assembled we want to hear it from the
[33:22] prophet and I've told you I wouldn't go
[33:25] to a lot of these churches
[33:27] that claim to be preaching the message
[33:30] that's why this building
[33:32] started July the 4th 1971 because we
[33:35] were so tired of listening to 65 little
[33:40] things and tired of wrong
[33:45] doctrines told you about the man
[33:47] standing up in the pull pit read the
[33:48] scripture woman shall be saved in
[33:52] childbearing he just
[33:55] stopped later on I said brother why
[33:57] didn't you read the rest of that well
[33:59] you mean I read what the Bible
[34:01] says I said but read the rest of the
[34:05] scripture right you're making
[34:07] childbearing saving women that's
[34:11] Catholic I
[34:13] said really I guess he didn't even know
[34:15] what the rest of it said I said the rest
[34:17] of it said if she continue in the faith
[34:20] right well he evidently didn't do no
[34:21] good he got up and about another day or
[34:23] two later read the same scripture
[34:25] stopped at the same point
[34:28] you see what I'm talking about
[34:31] yes I have become the enemy to people
[34:34] because I've
[34:35] tried to stay with the truth well I'll
[34:37] keep
[34:38] trying until the day I die I'll be
[34:41] fighting for this
[34:43] message well you're all here well come
[34:45] and show
[34:46] me that's on the internet that's on
[34:48] anywhere come and show me where I'm on
[34:50] now don't be silly don't come and say
[34:53] you PR you missed that quote just a
[34:55] little bit cuz you ain't going to talk
[34:58] two seconds and I'm going to tell you
[34:59] you goofed up and then we're going to be
[35:01] to goof up sitting looking at each other
[35:06] right bring the
[35:08] message show me where brother R said to
[35:11] bride if not to be the fullness of the
[35:14] godhead
[35:15] bodily I want a
[35:18] quote I want a
[35:20] scripture but the point of it is is like
[35:23] I said I'll get to the message in a
[35:25] minute you say I don't mean for you to
[35:28] raise your hand now and I don't mean I
[35:29] know I just mean what I'm saying but if
[35:31] I say raise your hand everybody that
[35:33] believes you're born again well Lord
[35:35] hands go up
[35:37] right raise your hand if you believe
[35:39] you're in the bride hands go
[35:41] up raise your hand if you believe that
[35:44] the bride will be the fullness of the
[35:45] godhead
[35:46] body you get cramps and down the hand
[35:50] goes well I I kind of believe that but
[35:54] it's just a little too far well I didn't
[35:56] say
[35:59] it the Bible says it and the prophet
[36:01] said it I didn't say it that's
[36:04] right right
[36:06] amen I just don't see it now there's
[36:09] where you're blind amen when you say I
[36:11] don't see it right amen if we had you
[36:15] had that Lula you'd have more signs and
[36:17] wonders like I said you want the rest of
[36:20] the service we'll just let everybody
[36:21] take it time about and testify about
[36:24] what God's done well people I can do
[36:27] that
[36:29] too okay I just got to explaining the
[36:32] anointing P
[36:34] out but will them people over there take
[36:36] the
[36:40] word there's going to be your criteria
[36:42] and what the big old words are there's
[36:44] going to be whatever you got to base it
[36:46] on is whether or not you believe the
[36:49] word
[36:51] amen come on the prophet said God would
[36:55] allow these things to to come
[36:57] absolutely to try you and
[37:02] I the Locust k p caterpillar the Bible
[37:06] says my great Army that I sent among
[37:10] you did God send it no he permitted it
[37:13] to come into
[37:14] being that's
[37:16] true to try you and I amen what does the
[37:21] word
[37:23] say what does the word say that's it
[37:26] that's that's all I've got folks that's
[37:28] just what does the word say okay let's
[37:31] get on a little bit
[37:34] further
[37:35] now we've been talking
[37:39] about the
[37:42] dispensation and we covered that I hope
[37:45] enough for you to
[37:47] understand that we believe in
[37:50] dispensations amen and the reason
[37:52] brother Brandon would say he didn't go
[37:54] along with dispensation so much was the
[37:56] interpret ation of the word dispensation
[37:58] are the things and it can mean
[38:00] stewardships it can mean different
[38:03] things but then when he would say I am a
[38:06] dispensationalist and when he says God
[38:08] is a dispensationalist that is even not
[38:10] a word until this later modern day in
[38:14] uh and you know it's not in Webster's
[38:16] Dictionary dispensational list is not in
[38:19] there it's in it's modern talk all right
[38:23] but see to me he's saying I believe in
[38:28] dispensations there was a dispensation
[38:30] Old Testament dispensation of the new
[38:32] there was a dispensation of the Son of
[38:34] God down through the church ages all
[38:37] right now is the dispensation or time of
[38:41] the son of man right all right it was
[38:43] the Gentile
[38:46] dispensation right cu the word
[38:49] dispensation is in the Bible it's a
[38:50] gentile dispens it's the time of the
[38:52] Gentiles right all right now then in
[38:56] being that the I love to look at words
[38:59] and then think a little and just
[39:02] consider the point of what's actually
[39:04] being said and then look at the
[39:07] scriptures uh thereby and and watch it
[39:10] tie together all right we believe that
[39:14] the prophet
[39:15] taught that there would be a
[39:17] dispensation we'll read it in a minute
[39:19] because we' already read it of the son
[39:21] of man all right
[39:24] now brother brandom will say that he is
[39:27] not the son of
[39:29] man but then why would he turn around
[39:32] and say the bride will be the son of man
[39:34] right now remember he's part of the
[39:37] Bride let's don't isolate
[39:39] him let his ministry isolate him or
[39:42] Elevate him to the position of leading
[39:45] the bride in the end time and he even I
[39:48] gave it to you the other day where that
[39:49] this would be that this this
[39:53] uh Mei forign things would be what would
[39:56] bring to pass these
[39:58] things you know it'll bring to pass
[40:01] these things in the bride all right
[40:03] without him we wouldn't have a message
[40:06] right but then he's gone and we're we're
[40:10] you know we are to be ready in his word
[40:13] now I I've never said to you publicly
[40:16] and and I there's no need of talking
[40:18] people talking about tent Visions return
[40:20] Ministries and all I've told you where I
[40:22] stand brother random can come back in 30
[40:25] 40 days he can preach to us I've never
[40:28] had no trouble with that cuz I believe
[40:29] that in the beginning I still believe it
[40:31] now but I'm not waiting on him because I
[40:34] know one
[40:35] thing if the people are not
[40:38] prepared what good would it do for him
[40:41] to come
[40:43] back that's right well he'll come back
[40:46] and prepare us 30 more years it took in
[40:50] 30 years to preach a statute of per
[40:52] that's his word come
[40:55] on come on folks 99% what's in here
[40:59] ain't got 30
[41:00] years
[41:02] right we going to be dead that's right
[41:05] are we going to be 110 years
[41:07] old or
[41:09] more right but Church
[41:14] listen then it's not trying to
[41:18] interpret it's just saying
[41:23] it we when the dead raises we're not
[41:25] going to
[41:27] oh brother let me uh brother collie I I
[41:30] heard there's dead people
[41:31] raised and I said well I don't know
[41:34] where to believe it or not he said well
[41:35] I don't know where to believe it or
[41:37] not what have we
[41:39] done you think that's going to be it no
[41:42] that's why the pictures are downstairs
[41:44] where you can see the people that have
[41:46] passed
[41:47] on when they walk in you'll say oh I
[41:52] know B Jimmy
[41:53] Gibson I never thought he looked like
[41:55] that
[41:57] but we got a picture of
[41:59] it where we can see it cuz they ain't
[42:02] going to raise old people sir now get
[42:05] that out of your mind it ain't going to
[42:06] be no old people in then made young out
[42:08] they raised that's you know
[42:11] no it's just going to be an end time
[42:14] people that are ready right
[42:19] ready for the coming of the
[42:22] Lord that's right that's the only thing
[42:24] that I've ever preached to you is be
[42:27] prepared I've tried to warn you about
[42:29] doctrines that's among the land cuz I
[42:32] thought that was my job as Pastor to do
[42:35] that but I can't convert
[42:38] you or change your
[42:40] mind and people are read the message or
[42:43] hear the message identically the same
[42:44] way I hear it because I didn't know they
[42:46] were two different messages and I know
[42:48] those flash tapes in the early
[42:50] Ministries and things but that's not
[42:51] supposed to be now we're supposed to be
[42:54] getting the the word right right
[42:56] straight from where the Prophet brought
[42:57] it you know and and things but you say
[43:01] you only quote so much well I I give you
[43:03] the opportunity I read the whole quote I
[43:06] put the quote on there yeah but that's
[43:08] just the way you see
[43:11] it thank you for telling me that's the
[43:13] way I see it because if it lines up with
[43:16] all this D right my seeing must be
[43:18] pretty good right but now if it's not
[43:21] what he taught I want you to tell me
[43:23] it's not I'm always open
[43:27] for
[43:28] discussion why because we will never
[43:31] Church all of
[43:33] us well brother so and so overseas
[43:35] brother so and so here brother so and so
[43:37] all said cat this morning well we say
[43:39] cat you see that's a silly illustration
[43:42] I'm trying to illustrate it it's never
[43:44] going to be why because I've preached to
[43:46] you what I believe that the ministry of
[43:48] Jesus Christ is around the world in the
[43:51] bride of Christ well we only have our
[43:53] little part here so we only have the
[43:57] toenail
[44:00] right we only have the small things I
[44:03] don't have no problems with that cuz I
[44:05] know
[44:06] it but we believe what he
[44:10] said but see you ain't going to convert
[44:12] people with reading what brother Brown
[44:14] says now they say I believe everything
[44:16] he
[44:17] says
[44:20] right but isn't it like brother R said
[44:22] about the Church of Christ man when he
[44:24] said the Bible still talk and where you
[44:27] at the church of Christ says we believe
[44:30] everything the Bible
[44:31] says well I kind of doubt that don't
[44:35] you if he did they'd be in this message
[44:38] right but you know what they're part of
[44:40] this message that's what people don't
[44:42] understand about me I don't denounce any
[44:46] church of what they
[44:49] brought and even these doctrines among
[44:51] the message they brought it to a place
[44:54] that they made you study
[44:58] to show yourself
[45:01] approved to keep you from being deceived
[45:03] right all
[45:05] right I don't know get it off and go on
[45:09] but you forgive me for being like that
[45:11] you forgive me for for being arrogant
[45:15] hateful whatever words you want to call
[45:17] me just forgive me of it and for just
[45:19] pray for
[45:20] me you
[45:23] know because I'm just trying to get get
[45:26] a bride
[45:27] ready that's it all right that's all I'm
[45:30] trying to do is get this group here
[45:32] ready anybody else listens in that's her
[45:34] business I'm not pastoring
[45:36] internet I refuse to be called
[45:41] at but what I'm saying
[45:44] church we are in the end time in the
[45:48] days as we read where the son of man
[45:50] would be
[45:52] revealed all
[45:53] right now there had to be a son of
[46:00] man to bring the message of the son of
[46:03] man we agree with that we believe it but
[46:07] what most people don't believe is that
[46:08] the brother brandham 464 the old seal B
[46:12] he's talking about the end time and he's
[46:15] talking about isusa Street and he said
[46:17] that there was a prophet came on isusa
[46:24] Street but he said then at the end of
[46:26] the time the messenger would
[46:28] come a prophet on a zeusa street brother
[46:32] Dale I don't believe that well you don't
[46:34] believe what brother random said that's
[46:36] your
[46:37] business I didn't say it I didn't have
[46:39] enough sense to say
[46:41] it I just found what he
[46:45] said all right then if that was the Holy
[46:49] Ghost that fell back there onusa
[46:51] street that was the prophet then the
[46:54] prophet has to deal with the Holy
[46:58] Spirit right and then it moves into the
[47:01] son of
[47:03] man
[47:05] right see then a prophet would start at
[47:07] the right place and then it would come
[47:10] into brother brandom's
[47:13] Ministry the prophet of God right but
[47:17] now it's into the ministry of the
[47:19] bride and I said raise your hand oh I
[47:22] believe I'm born again I believe I'm
[47:24] bride but I don't know where we're the
[47:26] fullness now that's you you don't
[47:28] understand me and I'm sorry you wasn't
[47:31] there but most of you were somewhere we
[47:35] Baptist you can say you believe you're
[47:37] born again yes I believe I'm no listen
[47:39] you believe you saved yeah I believe I'm
[47:42] saved you believe you're born again I
[47:44] believe I'm born
[47:46] again you believe you're going to heaven
[47:48] I hope I
[47:51] do see you just lost
[47:54] everything
[47:59] like I told you brother said I believe
[48:00] I'm born again but I don't know where
[48:01] I'm in Bride or
[48:06] not what kind of talk is
[48:09] that ain't even
[48:12] sensible if the prophet said the bride
[48:16] that God is not complete without the
[48:17] bride why can't we believe
[48:21] that and that's all I'm trying to
[48:24] explain if he said she's the fullness of
[48:26] the godhead bodily why can't we say
[48:30] that and I've made it over and over
[48:32] every time to say that to make sure you
[48:34] don't misunderstand I'm not talking
[48:35] about just an enti people I'm talking
[48:38] about the whole bride down through there
[48:40] cuz he standing in the midst of the
[48:42] seven golden candlesticks
[48:46] amen but why can't why can't we believe
[48:49] it Church
[48:51] yes he said I'd say to you do you
[48:54] believe this man I believe this
[48:57] message well do you put everything you
[48:59] got on this
[49:01] message as brother dick said years ago
[49:03] what if he come up one of these days and
[49:05] say brother Brandon was married about 10
[49:07] or 12 times and they got the documents
[49:09] to prove it
[49:11] with which I don't believe they will
[49:14] okay right but what if we
[49:17] do I'm getting out of this and find me
[49:20] something
[49:21] else
[49:23] what where is they something
[49:29] else right right but I he you know his
[49:34] statement was and my statement's always
[49:36] been the
[49:38] man by his preaching brought me to an
[49:42] understanding of the god that I desired
[49:45] to
[49:48] find and no matter what they say he was
[49:50] wrong here wrong there whatever that's
[49:53] between them and God right
[49:56] I just glory in the word that I've
[50:01] heard
[50:04] amen but now let's get down to the
[50:10] thought we
[50:13] read in Revelations
[50:17] 1 11-13 the other day when Wednesday we
[50:20] was preaching and we were bringing out
[50:22] it says one like unto the son of
[50:27] man we went down through that to show
[50:31] that and we will and have them in here
[50:33] maybe quote it
[50:35] again that when it says John turned to
[50:39] see the
[50:40] voice and he saw seven golden
[50:42] candlesticks and he saw the bride the
[50:45] prophet
[50:47] said right see now remember that if past
[50:51] our day in
[50:53] time when it's fully seen
[50:57] right cuz that's already over in the day
[50:59] of the
[51:01] Lord all right and that would put the
[51:03] fullness of the godhead bodily standing
[51:05] there in a people like unto the son of
[51:08] man
[51:13] amen it's going to be that when we
[51:17] become what we are supposed to be it
[51:20] will complete what God has planned for
[51:23] the entire Earthly Journey amen and will
[51:26] be able to stand there amen and be part
[51:30] of the Bride that'll be standing
[51:33] there all right but she'll be the
[51:35] fullness of the godhead bodily that's
[51:37] right now to be that then it would
[51:39] require that she also be the son of man
[51:44] that's
[51:46] right all right we went through showing
[51:49] that brother R the unveiling of God is a
[51:51] wonderful place to read from I ask you
[51:53] to read those Mighty God unveil
[51:55] unveiling of God and who is this mdic
[51:57] different ones matter of fact just read
[51:59] anything you're going to find it
[52:01] especially after 64 and up 63 and 64 up
[52:04] you're going to find him
[52:06] saying some things every time that's
[52:10] right you in every message all right
[52:13] brother Ray was bringing me something
[52:14] the other day that he always says in
[52:15] every message well you say well
[52:18] okay all right but think about
[52:23] it brother random explain expl it we
[52:25] went through it he said there in
[52:27] Revelations 1 going on down to the one
[52:29] standing there and all he said this is
[52:31] not a Prophet this is
[52:34] God all right but what form was he
[52:41] in he was in the form of one
[52:45] like unto the son of
[52:49] man
[52:51] right we need to study and think about
[52:54] one like unto the son of man see it
[52:56] doesn't say it was the son of man
[52:58] standing
[53:00] there but yet that was the son of man
[53:03] standing there because it was almighty
[53:05] God Amen but what form is he shown in
[53:08] like I said the Book of Revelation to me
[53:10] is most marvelous book of all the Bible
[53:12] because it's showing Jesus Christ but it
[53:15] never shows him
[53:16] alone it shows him in Bride form it
[53:19] shows him in 144,000 form shows him in
[53:21] foolish virgin form it shows him in all
[53:23] form but he's never by himself
[53:25] even when he's sitting on the throne
[53:27] we're sitting on the throne with him we
[53:28] went through that Wednesday
[53:31] night why it's G about the pouch
[53:34] feminist but yet the the government's
[53:37] upon his shoulders and it hangs down and
[53:39] that meant that he was no longer in
[53:41] service of gered around the waist but it
[53:43] was over his shoulder and the bride is
[53:45] to be the
[53:47] government she's the shoulders he's
[53:50] standing on that part is made manifest
[53:53] cuz he's the head
[53:55] all right but think about it what it
[53:57] really means to be
[54:00] like we take the word like as
[54:04] being
[54:07] well that that little baby back there
[54:11] little
[54:13] SRA you know she looks just like her
[54:18] mama Brother Anderson look at us well
[54:21] she's got characteristics about him too
[54:23] you know we see but you just look at the
[54:26] face and you look at her and you know
[54:29] and we've got pictures at home where
[54:32] that Nanny was back in her younger days
[54:34] you know and uh you know that Anna we
[54:38] got pictures of her when Nanny was one
[54:42] or two years old got pictures of Anna
[54:44] one or two years old we got pictures of
[54:46] abig Grace you know what very liking
[54:49] resemblance of each one until it's
[54:52] amazing you know how they look but
[54:55] that's what we think about
[54:57] resemblance all right but I'm not
[55:02] talking about this the resemblance to
[55:04] look
[55:06] like we're going to tie together a few
[55:08] words and then you'll you'll you'll see
[55:10] more about what I'm talking about
[55:12] and but titled is the son of man and
[55:14] we'll get on back to more this afternoon
[55:16] I'm sure but look at number one is what
[55:19] we've got and this is taken from
[55:21] Revelations 1 where it says one standing
[55:24] in the midst of the s golden C like unto
[55:27] the son of
[55:29] man all right that word
[55:31] like it means
[55:35] similar it means
[55:39] resembling in other words to resemble
[55:42] something it means like or
[55:45] corresponding to a
[55:48] thing
[55:50] what
[55:52] like now we go over in
[55:56] Genesis 1:26 and
[56:00] 27 and it says that God made man in
[56:05] what his
[56:08] likeness see after his likeness goes on
[56:11] talks about his image and all but it's
[56:14] after his
[56:15] likeness all right now pull up that word
[56:20] that other one was
[56:21] 3664 is the one in Revelations uh 1 133
[56:25] says like now this is taken from uh
[56:28] Genesis 1 126 and this is number will
[56:32] come up
[56:33] 1823 and look what it
[56:35] says it says
[56:38] likeness or
[56:43] similitude now if you think about it you
[56:45] remember the scripture that it says that
[56:47] he came into what the similitude of man
[56:49] in other words that doesn't mean just to
[56:51] look like a
[56:53] man he he came as
[56:57] man right right talking about similitude
[57:00] of our transgressions but all says in
[57:03] the likeness of are like
[57:06] as all right that it starts off in
[57:10] Genesis as being similitude or whatever
[57:16] and we know that when we were made in
[57:18] His
[57:20] image in his likeness
[57:22] means that the one you're speaking of
[57:26] there
[57:29] is God himself right Genesis 1:26 is
[57:34] explaining the soul of God the beginning
[57:38] the creation all right and it's it's in
[57:41] his likeness it doesn't mean likeness
[57:43] like look like right that's illustrating
[57:45] that you know look like Sarah looks like
[57:48] her mother but she's not her mother
[57:51] right Anna looked like her mother you
[57:54] know abig Grace looked like her mother
[57:56] but there's not the mother there's a lot
[57:58] of difference there that's different
[58:00] people but when you're go into
[58:02] terminologies of the Bible you're not
[58:03] talking about something who just looks
[58:05] like
[58:06] it all right because that can be the
[58:10] devil can imitate that
[58:12] easily but you're talking about the word
[58:15] what did he call it IM morphe change in
[58:19] form so who is this 126 and 27
[58:23] man
[58:26] it's the soul of almighty God which is
[58:29] God himself
[58:32] amen right amen not something to look
[58:37] like but something in another
[58:42] form and then
[58:44] morphe the same person in another
[58:48] form not person in the form of a
[58:52] person all right now now watch it now
[58:55] watch we get down to these definitions
[58:57] and we'll quit probably do
[59:00] this so we go over and we read in you
[59:04] remember the
[59:06] likeness after our likeness in Genesis
[59:09] 126 we'll go over now and we'll read in
[59:14] Philippians all right Philippians
[59:19] 2 let this mind be in you which we also
[59:22] in Christ Jesus who being in the form of
[59:25] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[59:28] with
[59:29] God but made himself of no reputation
[59:32] and took upon him the form in morphe he
[59:35] changed his form same God of a servant
[59:37] and was made in the likeness of
[59:41] men now look up that
[59:45] definition 3667 go ahead to number
[59:49] five it means likeness made like to
[59:52] similitude or shape
[59:55] now watch the opening of the meaning of
[59:57] the word of likeness as it comes
[1:00:00] forth that which has been made after the
[1:00:03] likeness of something that's fine a
[1:00:08] figure image
[1:00:11] likeness
[1:00:15] representation now you're getting a
[1:00:16] better word right now watch likeness in
[1:00:20] other words
[1:00:23] resembling such as
[1:00:25] amounts well
[1:00:28] nigh to equality or identity that's
[1:00:37] right see he changed and formed to
[1:00:39] become a
[1:00:42] man
[1:00:44] right but that was still the same
[1:00:47] God right yes so he changed in form as
[1:00:51] we want to go with it to day of
[1:00:53] Pentecost
[1:00:55] and he changed in
[1:00:58] form in bright form which would be
[1:01:01] called Holy Ghost baptism Son of God all
[1:01:04] right now then that all relates back to
[1:01:09] Revelations
[1:01:11] 1113 one like unto the son of
[1:01:15] man we see it's not somebody that looks
[1:01:17] like the son of
[1:01:20] man right right it's the son of man in
[1:01:23] another form
[1:01:25] okay hold your
[1:01:28] seat if Genesis 1
[1:01:31] 126 is
[1:01:34] right that he made man in his own
[1:01:37] likeness and if that's
[1:01:39] true I leave that up to you if that's
[1:01:42] true see I believe
[1:01:44] it that that means that that's not
[1:01:46] another
[1:01:47] person cuz you're going back to your
[1:01:49] trinitarian
[1:01:52] thoughts it means that that is the the
[1:01:54] same
[1:01:57] person in another
[1:02:00] form right so Genesis
[1:02:04] 2626 is God made
[1:02:08] manifest in another
[1:02:10] form that's right call
[1:02:14] man but not dealing with the flesh man
[1:02:16] in 126
[1:02:19] right
[1:02:21] that's two Genesis 2 Genesis 2 we're
[1:02:25] made in the image fleshly of
[1:02:28] animals you know right this is this is
[1:02:32] just an animal
[1:02:34] outside but on the inside by the new
[1:02:39] birth we have a marvelous situation
[1:02:44] under thinking
[1:02:46] about so now I hope you're going to get
[1:02:49] what I'm trying to say when I speak of
[1:02:51] the son of
[1:02:52] man I look back can I
[1:02:55] see the Lord Jesus Christ who never
[1:02:59] referred to himself as Son of God yet he
[1:03:03] was born
[1:03:04] that and he says I am the word and all
[1:03:08] of that all right but he never referred
[1:03:12] to himself as Son of God why because the
[1:03:16] IM morphe or form he was in was in the
[1:03:20] form of son of
[1:03:22] man all right
[1:03:25] now remember he comes son of man Son of
[1:03:27] God Son of
[1:03:28] David right all right and I know when I
[1:03:31] make statements people I don't know
[1:03:33] about that he was son of man while he
[1:03:36] was alive on Earth and walking he died
[1:03:38] son of man yes now the same one raised
[1:03:42] same body raised but how did it raise in
[1:03:45] a glorified State and what happened the
[1:03:47] life that was in
[1:03:50] him right went into the church to
[1:03:53] fulfill what he said Upon This Rock I'll
[1:03:55] build my church AR it went into Son of
[1:03:59] God
[1:04:01] dispensation you don't have any writings
[1:04:04] by Paul and them in the writings of son
[1:04:07] of
[1:04:10] man but John immediately upon
[1:04:14] patmas he's seeing one like unto the son
[1:04:16] of man and he knows the voice remember
[1:04:19] yes he turned to see The Voice he didn't
[1:04:21] turn to see the he knew who the person
[1:04:23] was that's right right he knew that was
[1:04:25] Jesus Christ speaking to
[1:04:29] him but when he turned being a prophet
[1:04:32] he would see symbolics that's
[1:04:34] right you know what he saw when he
[1:04:36] turned Jesus
[1:04:39] right but he was in another
[1:04:43] form
[1:04:44] right like unto the son of man so he's
[1:04:48] in bright form as we covered the other
[1:04:50] night but just remember son of man
[1:04:54] Son of God Son of
[1:04:58] David now brother Brandon will say son
[1:05:00] of God Son of Man son of
[1:05:02] David uh you know different ways but my
[1:05:05] point is
[1:05:07] what you read the unveiling of God and
[1:05:09] you keep on you'll get what he's talking
[1:05:11] about that's right son of man while he
[1:05:13] was on
[1:05:14] Earth died that son of man Rose Son of
[1:05:17] God come on to death Pentecost and the
[1:05:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost in the bride
[1:05:22] to be the son of God
[1:05:26] but the reason he's got to come back in
[1:05:28] the end time as son of man because you
[1:05:30] can't go from Holy Spirit Son of God to
[1:05:34] son of
[1:05:37] David you have no earthly
[1:05:40] connection all
[1:05:42] right you got to have a connection made
[1:05:45] so he's son of man then he's Son of God
[1:05:49] then he returns in the end time as son
[1:05:51] of
[1:05:52] man then he can be son of David cuz you
[1:05:55] know what son of David
[1:05:57] is son of David is in the Millennium
[1:05:59] right and you know what he is the reason
[1:06:01] he's son of David he'll be king of the
[1:06:03] Earth
[1:06:05] right right come on he'll be king king
[1:06:08] of the earth Amen in the Millennium
[1:06:11] Jesus Christ will be king of the
[1:06:13] earth and his wife the bride will be
[1:06:16] there with
[1:06:18] him all
[1:06:20] right so then as looking at it see you
[1:06:23] can see a beautiful picture
[1:06:25] unfold yes that he's got to return as
[1:06:29] son of man yes CU son of man is the word
[1:06:33] made flesh whereas Son of God is the
[1:06:37] Holy Ghost living in you that's right
[1:06:41] and if the bride is going to be the
[1:06:42] fullness of the godhead bodily and if
[1:06:44] the bride is going to be the son of man
[1:06:46] she's going to be the word made
[1:06:48] flesh that's right and Luther was a word
[1:06:51] made flesh absolutely amen but there was
[1:06:54] no dispensation he could make manifest
[1:06:56] That's
[1:06:57] Right
[1:07:00] Wesley come
[1:07:02] on he was the word made flesh ausa
[1:07:05] Street was the word made flesh right and
[1:07:08] a people but yet that wasn't the
[1:07:10] dispensation or imorphia or change that
[1:07:13] God would bring into being so he's going
[1:07:15] to be in The Bride In the End Time Amen
[1:07:18] in morphe
[1:07:20] yes the life formed to the Gentile
[1:07:23] dispensation
[1:07:24] that's why I say we're not Oneness cuz
[1:07:26] Oneness is like Jesus and they say Jesus
[1:07:29] is the light form of God well I differ
[1:07:31] with him right the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:07:34] is the liest form of God brother of
[1:07:36] random is in that bride he is not the LI
[1:07:39] form of God God was in the man but you
[1:07:42] remember the man is a part of the body
[1:07:44] of
[1:07:45] Christ what a wonderful place for him to
[1:07:47] be as part of the body of Christ as a
[1:07:49] born again believer as a church age
[1:07:51] messenger but as a prophet to bring
[1:07:53] bring the word how much greater could
[1:07:56] you proclaim the man to
[1:07:59] be no wonder he says you were given more
[1:08:01] gifts and things in anybody why because
[1:08:04] he's to finish it all up right but you
[1:08:07] see what I'm talking about cuz we'll
[1:08:08] just end there cuz if I get in the other
[1:08:10] I'm going to get in the other parts of
[1:08:11] it we don't need to we do that this
[1:08:16] evening we'll go back to where brother R
[1:08:18] said he could not
[1:08:21] come calling himself in the ages as son
[1:08:25] of man he called himself Son of
[1:08:29] God because that would be the
[1:08:33] dispensation of the Son of God to the
[1:08:35] ages now is changing
[1:08:38] dispensation he said the lady see and
[1:08:40] age is over but lady see and age he said
[1:08:43] goes on to connects to the Millennium
[1:08:45] really because it goes on through the
[1:08:46] tribulation as ladyo seea there's not
[1:08:48] another
[1:08:50] age
[1:08:51] H but he says the bride called
[1:08:55] out what she called out
[1:08:58] for we get that this evening what she
[1:09:01] called out for she's called out to be in
[1:09:03] a dispensation to where that we can walk
[1:09:05] up and look death in the face and walk
[1:09:07] off of this Earth because the original
[1:09:09] son of man done that am
[1:09:13] right all right now remember they had to
[1:09:17] kill him where he could make it manifest
[1:09:19] we won't be killed in the end time to
[1:09:20] come forth somebody's going to walk
[1:09:22] right into death and and won't be killed
[1:09:25] now the ones that's died and one own is
[1:09:26] going to be raised to be part of that
[1:09:28] okay all right now but
[1:09:31] look well n to equality or ident
[1:09:34] identity that's
[1:09:37] good now I'll just make this statement
[1:09:39] and we'll quit on
[1:09:41] it so then
[1:09:45] he's in Genesis it's
[1:09:50] likeness and that's not another God
[1:09:54] it's God in another
[1:09:57] form to display himself as his children
[1:10:03] right Paul in Philippians speaks of the
[1:10:05] likeness this man that
[1:10:08] came of mankind so he came in our
[1:10:12] likeness he came in our
[1:10:14] form right he changed his form to come
[1:10:18] down to be like you and I for the reason
[1:10:21] that he could take you and I to be into
[1:10:23] his form
[1:10:24] all right then when you see him in
[1:10:26] Revelations is already passed the the
[1:10:28] time I know where it's at come on I'm
[1:10:31] not misplacing it so don't run it off
[1:10:33] chapter 4 is where John is taken up but
[1:10:36] remember you better read chapter one
[1:10:38] because brother Brown said this is not
[1:10:40] in the days of man this is in the days
[1:10:42] of the Lord so this is chapter one is
[1:10:46] showing it totally finished right that's
[1:10:49] why it's showing it that
[1:10:52] way the same God that started off that
[1:10:55] had the condescend down keep changing
[1:10:57] his form to become a
[1:10:59] man started on the day of Pentecost as
[1:11:02] to bringing the Holy Ghost into the
[1:11:04] people and bringing it through
[1:11:06] dispensations and bringing it through to
[1:11:09] where that he could say in chapter one
[1:11:12] of Revelations about verse 13 one like
[1:11:15] unto the son of
[1:11:17] man
[1:11:18] now would not that
[1:11:22] be now remember Genesis 1 126 and
[1:11:27] 27 said this is not man you know like
[1:11:31] one man a man this is
[1:11:34] man what was he speaking of when he said
[1:11:36] this is not just a man but he's speaking
[1:11:38] of man he's speaking of the soul of
[1:11:41] almighty
[1:11:42] God because the body was not created
[1:11:45] until chapter 2 agree then in Chapter
[1:11:49] two The Soul was put into the body and
[1:11:51] now are you standing with Adam all right
[1:11:54] now that part came
[1:11:59] into the Lord Jesus
[1:12:02] Christ to finish that Genesis 1: 126 and
[1:12:06] 27 Those Old Testament people could not
[1:12:09] be born again because the Holy Ghost had
[1:12:11] not been given his life had not been
[1:12:13] shed the animal life couldn't come back
[1:12:14] and change him all right but see then
[1:12:17] the Lord Jesus Christ could make a way
[1:12:19] and he did he gave the Holy Ghost which
[1:12:22] would come on the day of Pentecost in
[1:12:23] the New Birth you and I Son of God you
[1:12:27] know no matter what age you're born in
[1:12:28] it's Son of God being made
[1:12:31] manifest then in the end time he's to
[1:12:33] return back and be revealed or made
[1:12:35] known or come into
[1:12:38] being as son of
[1:12:40] man and you see him immediately in
[1:12:43] chapter one of
[1:12:44] Revelation one like unto the son of man
[1:12:48] see because that is the whole of 126 and
[1:12:52] 27
[1:12:56] standing in being
[1:12:58] amen that's right did you notice way I
[1:13:01] said it the whole of it I wrote in my
[1:13:03] thing the
[1:13:05] completeness 126 and 27 shows the man
[1:13:09] that God
[1:13:11] wanted that he started in Genesis to
[1:13:14] bring him into
[1:13:15] being which would be his own offspring
[1:13:18] amen which would be his children amen
[1:13:22] that would come in into be and then in
[1:13:25] the end time he would come back and make
[1:13:27] that
[1:13:29] known and start dealing with son of
[1:13:34] man why would your Prophet then start
[1:13:38] sure he's dealing son of man prophetic
[1:13:40] ministry right we know that but then he
[1:13:45] immediately starts speaking of another
[1:13:49] form of the original grain or seed that
[1:13:53] went into the ground which was the son
[1:13:56] of man would come back through the
[1:13:58] church
[1:14:00] ages and then come out in the end time
[1:14:03] to be the original grain that went into
[1:14:05] the
[1:14:08] ground not to just look like
[1:14:13] right but to be the very total
[1:14:16] person we reading when we get on in this
[1:14:18] evening brother Brown said and that goes
[1:14:20] to show
[1:14:22] it
[1:14:23] God and man
[1:14:29] together what do you think God thinks of
[1:14:31] you and
[1:14:35] I he thinks so much of us until he'll
[1:14:37] never be seen
[1:14:40] apart
[1:14:43] never never will he ever be seen
[1:14:48] apart people at gil they think me and my
[1:14:51] wife they think she's got me henpecked

[1:16:31] words but you'll know it's
[1:16:33] true had those people Li listened to the
[1:16:36] Lord Jesus and the ones who did got out
[1:16:39] of
[1:16:43] Jerusalem there was none of the
[1:16:46] Christians now come on none of the
[1:16:49] Christian born again
[1:16:51] Believers there was none of them there
[1:16:53] when Titus

[1:17:00] what go right where we was reading at it
[1:17:03] starts talking about it right amen when
[1:17:05] you see this and when you see that and
[1:17:08] get out you know what my point is they

[1:17:13] prepared and when everybody else saw
[1:17:15] Titus
[1:17:17] coming right they saw him coming I mean
[1:17:20] in that day it wouldn't a surprise
[1:17:22] overnight I mean my Lord you can see 500
[1:17:25] miles you

[1:17:30] cheap scope they already had things back

[1:17:34] they already had a lot of it you can see
[1:17:36] them coming you can see the dust
[1:17:38] boiling they knew Titus was
[1:17:42] coming and back then they didn't didn't
[1:17:44] just come in and do it they send a
[1:17:47] runner over and said we'll be there in 3

[1:18:29] not in the winter time on the Sabbath
[1:18:31] day CU see the hills were snow Brown in
[1:18:34] the winter time he told them that Titus
[1:18:37] was
[1:18:39] coming and you know what the real
[1:18:41] Christians when they seen Titus coming
[1:18:44] they didn't run to the
[1:18:46] altar they got out of the
[1:18:49] city not a true Christian was left in
[1:18:52] the city
[1:18:53] it was only the Jews and the people
[1:18:56] there and they thought they could gather
[1:18:59] in the around the temple and God would
[1:19:01] protect
[1:19:02] them and see the God had already
[1:19:06] left the dispensation and
[1:19:09] changed God had left the Tabernacle the
