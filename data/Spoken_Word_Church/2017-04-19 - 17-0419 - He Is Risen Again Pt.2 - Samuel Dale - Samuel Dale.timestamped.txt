[4:26] delivering and we expect you to continue
[4:29] to do that we love you in Jesus name
[4:31] Amen and we read this sunday but we want
[4:36] to continue on with our thought from
[4:38] Sunday and just make it like a part two
[4:41] of the resurrection so we'll read I read
[4:45] the entire chapter of mark 16 so let's
[4:49] just read it again and think about the
[4:50] things that it's saying goes now listen
[4:52] it this mark 16 shows all the way from
[4:58] the resurrection you know showing the
[5:00] resurrection the thing shows up through
[5:02] and showing how that he appears to him
[5:05] and show right up to the place that he
[5:08] is taken up into the skies and shows all
[5:11] the way down through the ages and coming
[5:14] down to where we are in the end time
[5:16] picking up from this one scripture so
[5:20] just think on these things and when the
[5:22] Sabbath was faced mary magdalene and
[5:24] mary mother of James and saw me had
[5:26] brought sweet spices that they might
[5:28] come and anoint him and very early in
[5:32] the morning the first day of the week
[5:33] they came into this up with you at the
[5:35] rising of the Sun
[5:36] and they said among themselves who shall
[5:38] roll us away the stone from the door of
[5:42] the surface here and when they looked
[5:45] they saw that the stone was rolled away
[5:47] for it was very great in other words
[5:51] they knew something had to happen right
[5:52] it was rolled away and entering into the
[5:55] something to he saw a young man sitting
[5:57] on the right side clothed in a long
[6:00] white garment and they were a Friday
[6:02] they're afraid right and he said unto
[6:05] them be not afraid be not afraid you
[6:09] seek Jesus of Nazareth which was
[6:11] crucified he is risen he is not here
[6:14] behold the place where they laid him but
[6:17] go your way tell his disciples and Peter
[6:19] that he caught before you into Galilee
[6:22] now remember the announcement he is
[6:25] risen proof he goes before them right
[6:29] all right into Galilee and Dyer you
[6:32] shall see him as he said unto you and
[6:35] they went out quickly and fled from the
[6:38] shop richer for that trouble they were
[6:41] troubled for they troubled and were
[6:43] amazed neither said they anything to any
[6:46] man for they were afraid now when Jesus
[6:51] was risen early the first day of the
[6:52] week he appeared first to Mary Magdalene
[6:55] out of whom had got seven devils and she
[6:58] went and told them that had been with
[7:02] him as they mourned and wept and they
[7:06] when they had heard that he was alive
[7:08] and had been seen of her believe not
[7:13] what about personal witnesses what about
[7:16] even after they're seeing him you know
[7:21] after the resurrection and they're still
[7:23] doubting over the book of Acts you
[7:27] restore the kingdom to Israel at this
[7:29] time see even after seeing even walking
[7:32] with him all right now watch it goes
[7:35] from the morning now here's props to the
[7:38] evening after that appeared in another
[7:40] form unto two of them as they walked and
[7:43] went into the country and they went and
[7:45] told it unto the residue neither believe
[7:47] they them afterward he appeared into the
[7:50] 11 as I said it meet and upbraided them
[7:52] with their unbelief and hardness of
[7:54] heart because they believe not them
[7:56] which had seen him after he was risen
[8:00] now watch you now it jumps all the way
[8:02] to his ascension because if you'll take
[8:05] this put it in Matthew in them you'll
[8:07] see that this part when he gives this
[8:10] statement to them actually falls right
[8:13] at his ascension and going up into the
[8:15] acts of the book of Acts because like
[8:17] look what he said he said unto them go
[8:19] ye into all the world and preach the
[8:21] gospel to every creature he that
[8:24] believeth in his baptized shall be saved
[8:25] but he that believeth not shall be
[8:27] damned these signs shall follow them
[8:30] that believe in my name shall they cast
[8:32] out Devils they shall speak with new
[8:34] tongues they shall take up serpents and
[8:36] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[8:38] not hurt them and they shall lay hands
[8:41] on the sick and they shall recover so
[8:45] then after the Lord had spoken unto them
[8:48] he was received up into heaven and sit
[8:52] on the right hand of God and they went
[8:54] forth and preached ever were the Lord
[8:57] working with them and confirming the
[8:59] word with signs following them you may
[9:02] be seated the Lord at his blessing to
[9:04] the reading of the word now we tried to
[9:08] bring up just a simple point son desire
[9:12] because we had a lot of company in and
[9:13] thanks and keeping it down to just do
[9:16] resurrection and everything and then
[9:18] Wade comes along in the afternoon he
[9:20] doesn't know what I'm going to preach on
[9:21] I don't know I don't know what he's
[9:23] going to preach on but he comes right in
[9:26] and picks up the point and curves it on
[9:28] in to a good understanding will overlap
[9:31] that in a minute and to just move right
[9:34] on through it to where we can see it and
[9:36] you know I pray that you will we're
[9:40] listening now as I said his resurrection
[9:44] would have been early in the morning and
[9:47] then the whole day price's and he
[9:50] appears to the two on the road to Emmaus
[9:52] all right then we see to that even as he
[9:56] gets here in the commandments he give
[9:57] read all your Gospels together and
[9:59] you'll start moving to ward and then
[10:02] you'll see them as the two angels
[10:04] no standing by when he really said why
[10:06] are you looking to heaven for like Wade
[10:08] was all about looking for him up dire
[10:09] well he's not going to be up there the
[10:13] resurrection that he done the reason for
[10:16] him to raise would be that he's going to
[10:19] come back and live within you all right
[10:24] and we know that took place because then
[10:27] that way we can see that that it's been
[10:29] a wonderful thing down through the ages
[10:31] of all the time knowing that we all have
[10:35] had an experience of the resurrection
[10:38] all going again believers of the
[10:41] Resurrection inside of the other you
[10:44] know it's not just looking for a
[10:45] resurrection with the resurrection and
[10:48] within us all right now in doing that
[10:51] then it would bring the resurrection to
[10:54] a present tense point as I said we
[10:57] always read that and and man will read
[10:59] it in his mind he reads he is risen but
[11:02] in his mind he's reading he has risen or
[11:05] he was risen or maybe he raised or
[11:08] something like that his mind is not
[11:11] reading them point of this picture but
[11:13] the scripture said he is risen which
[11:17] would mean ever present that is comes to
[11:20] a point that it's saying okay that's
[11:22] here now so ever born again believer now
[11:26] down through the Bible ever born again
[11:29] believer would have that experience you
[11:33] know coming down from Calvary coming
[11:35] through into the New Testament with how
[11:36] the experience of the newburgh which
[11:40] would be the very resurrection inside of
[11:44] us and the Prophet said what a
[11:46] resurrection that was what a
[11:48] resurrection this is all right now it's
[11:50] been the resurrection the whole time all
[11:54] right and that's why I asked you to
[11:56] question sunday or me and all of us you
[11:59] know what does that resurrection mean to
[12:01] each one of us you know what is it to
[12:05] you and I the resurrection well we just
[12:08] believe it sometimes distance that's
[12:09] going to happen like this but if the
[12:12] Prophet is right anyone I believe it is
[12:17] I just said that way for you to think
[12:19] about it then he said the resurrection
[12:21] was inside of you well then why are we
[12:25] looking for somewhere else for a
[12:28] resurrection when I looked into our own
[12:31] experience talking to some people today
[12:34] get my hair cut and they were talking
[12:37] about the Bible its end I told him I
[12:39] said I said I've never tried to read the
[12:42] Bible to memorize it in the brothers are
[12:47] mean the man that I've known him a long
[12:48] time and I'm furious in here he said
[12:50] I've read I know the old testament
[12:52] 20-something times well that's glory I
[12:54] mean that's good i'm wonderful but I
[12:58] said I've never tried to read the Bible
[12:59] to memorize it I read it to try to see
[13:02] what it's saying to me I said but most
[13:06] people read the Bible to see what it's
[13:08] saying about somebody else you know
[13:11] looking at in about somebody else and
[13:13] even in the best that can do it look at
[13:15] it were like oh but we can't be Paul you
[13:18] know now and all we just you know we
[13:21] just can't be that away well if it's
[13:23] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[13:24] and forever but then could it be that
[13:28] Paul might one swap places with you but
[13:32] his our down to this hour goes but a
[13:34] random shows us out where you say well
[13:36] now he didn't you just got pudding he
[13:38] said if I'd had the choice I would have
[13:41] took this hour one because it's
[13:43] finishing all things up all right but
[13:46] it's coming to a resurrection and the
[13:48] proof of his resurrection has been down
[13:52] through the church ages that the people
[13:56] would recognize that when he would say
[13:59] I'll be with you always even to the end
[14:00] of the world or hallway you know that he
[14:03] would be living in each one of us and it
[14:07] would not be that we would be like them
[14:11] and I emphasize the point that the Bible
[14:15] said he was seen a 500 brethren after
[14:17] his resurrection we know 380 of much not
[14:21] much up odors only 120 in the upper room
[14:26] well could it be
[14:30] possible to really see God could it be
[14:36] possible to do that to really see him
[14:39] you know you said well he wasn't born
[14:42] again I'll agree with you they didn't
[14:46] have an inside teacher you know until
[14:51] Calvary and then the day of Pentecost
[14:53] alright but looks like somebody would
[14:56] have begin to believe it you know I mean
[15:01] you know we used to tell off on doubting
[15:04] Thomas but there's one thing about it
[15:06] when he did get to do what he said he'd
[15:09] like to do he said Lord forgive me no he
[15:13] believed it it has the resurrection does
[15:17] it mean anything to you because we
[15:20] always try to make the emphasis of what
[15:23] not trying to come to a rapture because
[15:28] we know that the resurrection must come
[15:31] before the rapture that's simple stretch
[15:35] your right Lord himself shall descend
[15:37] from heaven with a shout board our kind
[15:39] of trouble gone then the dead in Christ
[15:41] shall rise first and then we which are
[15:42] alive and remain all right a simple
[15:44] scripture explaining that that's what's
[15:47] going to take place well I wonder did it
[15:51] mean this or will do the top of this for
[15:53] that see that's the way we get into all
[15:55] of those things by the reasoning of a
[15:58] mankind to try to figure them out and
[16:00] it's like I said I never read the Bible
[16:02] I never have I don't read it now I don't
[16:07] read beretta rounds message I don't
[16:08] listen to take some time to try to
[16:11] figure out now listen I'm not doing it
[16:16] to even try to figure out what he's
[16:17] saying or what the Bible's saying I'm
[16:24] wanting to know what he said by
[16:25] experience so you can holler Hebrews 13
[16:31] 80 you want to and not believe he's the
[16:35] same
[16:36] because the property said if he's not
[16:39] the same in every way except the
[16:41] Corporal body he said then you're an
[16:44] interception of sight well she's in the
[16:47] resurrection is a very valuable thing to
[16:49] each and every one of us but he didn't
[16:53] leave us with just say y'all oh how is
[16:57] it the Prophet said he didn't leave us
[16:59] with just a point of a Bible to read or
[17:04] a thoughts or ideas he come to live in
[17:08] us not to just give us a book to read
[17:14] that's wonderful but then he turned
[17:19] around the prophet and say after all the
[17:21] emphasis he put up on the Bible he
[17:23] turned around sick as long as it's
[17:25] laying here on these pages what do you
[17:27] say it can be questioned well I tell you
[17:31] what now I don't question it oh you hear
[17:34] that a lot don't you no I don't question
[17:37] it now I believe it well that's what I
[17:41] mean I'm not trying to figure out what
[17:44] the Prophet is taught us I don't study
[17:47] for a sermon to try to figure out
[17:49] something and I could find that somebody
[17:51] else hasn't talked you know that's not
[17:57] dark it's to see what he wants me to say
[18:01] what part that I've got to do with it
[18:04] that's the way we should read the Bible
[18:06] or listen to the message that way no
[18:09] that way then you won't be in a
[18:11] situation of the scent or they found 24
[18:14] more tapes we need to get every one of
[18:16] them well praise God we do we need to
[18:18] get everyone listen to them 10 times the
[18:20] face a man what is it looking for
[18:24] something that's secretly hidden or is
[18:31] it looking for the resurrection of Jesus
[18:33] Christ because the Bible said it if he
[18:38] raised we praise also waivers bringing
[18:41] that up Sunday right through the message
[18:43] with enjoyed it those are sitting her
[18:45] life in saying well I got a priest windy
[18:48] so I wonder how far he's going
[18:50] I wonder what quotes he's going to use
[18:52] well they was already I didn't redo the
[18:54] quotes and not do you noticed that it
[18:56] was already tired in the lineup and the
[18:59] quotes for youth coming from Sunday but
[19:02] you know i'm not i'm looking to try to
[19:05] see what god is speaking to you that's
[19:09] what the resurrection has to do with me
[19:11] not just looking to the man raised but
[19:18] looking that that man has raised and
[19:20] lives inside of you and I look at how he
[19:27] lived and worried live and what he's
[19:29] doing and how there's been him all the
[19:31] way down to his are coming forth in each
[19:37] age bringing forth himself and really
[19:41] the resurrection is what the revealed
[19:44] Word is that true the resurrection is
[19:48] the reveal word because if it's not
[19:50] revealed that's what I've tried to
[19:52] preach to you when Martin Luther see
[19:56] something raised in that man something
[19:59] happened like we're talking want to go
[20:01] about a revelation from God you know God
[20:05] speaking to you in Revelation don't that
[20:07] make you feel just about that big don't
[20:11] you make it feel like Brett around said
[20:13] crawl under a ten-gallon hat for the
[20:16] thing that a god of glory no matter what
[20:19] you think you're God is butta into
[20:20] whatever is if he would come down and
[20:24] talk to you there'd be a wonderful time
[20:25] later that's what he's trying to do he's
[20:29] trying to reveal his word to us what
[20:31] other talking do we won't but then him
[20:35] reveal something to you that you've
[20:37] always wondered about good wonder what
[20:41] wanted to say that and you tried to
[20:45] figure it out by rereading going over it
[20:47] and studying it and everything and
[20:49] reading what other people how to say
[20:51] about it and all kind of things but then
[20:55] one day God just opens the door
[21:01] and you just see something you know my
[21:07] wife I remember years ago because
[21:08] remember in the the prophet in the
[21:12] statue of a perfect man see why didn't
[21:16] he read some of these scriptures over
[21:18] here he said it looked like he would
[21:20] read them here and then it would have
[21:22] been on I said Bonnie wouldn't meant to
[21:24] be that way it was meant to be that way
[21:28] he was meant for him to read what ever
[21:30] had because that was to bring it for it
[21:34] and that's where we learned it from sure
[21:36] we get everything we get by way of the
[21:38] Prophet but can't you see that you're in
[21:43] the red you know you're already in the
[21:46] resurrection by the resurrection being
[21:48] in you right you're already in the
[21:51] rapture by the Holy Ghost being within
[21:53] you there's no way to stop it from
[21:56] taking place I don't care where you die
[21:58] don't care what happens there's no way
[22:02] to stop that resurrection and there's no
[22:04] way to stop the rapture and like I've
[22:08] always said when he gave you the Holy
[22:10] Ghost right then he laid claim on that
[22:15] body that you're living in you're not
[22:20] going to get a new body because you
[22:24] wouldn't think one it's this body to be
[22:27] redeemed all right now we're going one
[22:31] way or the other to that position if we
[22:35] die and go by the grave then we're
[22:36] resurrect in Greece that position but if
[22:39] we don't we're going to stay here and
[22:41] then they're going to raise and then
[22:44] we're going to join them in a
[22:47] resurrection all right to believe in and
[22:51] he's the same yesterday today and
[22:53] forever is to see what's happening in
[23:00] your day not to go back and it's
[23:04] wonderful go back and read about another
[23:06] day and what happened in this mood in
[23:09] Calvin and knocks and penny I love to
[23:12] read though
[23:14] read about brother branham and his
[23:16] experiences and done it's thrilling to
[23:19] us write what you know that won't change
[23:23] you at all and will challenge you it's
[23:31] got to be something personal alright so
[23:35] the resurrection is not just a raising
[23:38] up of a body just remember Luther had
[23:47] his resurrection within him when he went
[23:51] down are you following me his
[23:56] resurrection was in him he's not going
[24:00] to be somebody preach something for a
[24:03] resurrection within him his resurrection
[24:07] was inside of him well why can't you
[24:12] believe it's inside of you till then I'm
[24:15] take away the fear of death it'll take
[24:19] it to a place that will see what's
[24:21] taking place i wrote it like this i said
[24:24] do you see what I'm talking about then I
[24:29] wrote now this is what I had left over
[24:32] and I wrote what I said do you see what
[24:38] I'm talking about you see it said what
[24:43] that he's the same in every age in the
[24:50] people he's always the same and he
[24:57] changed in has the resurrection inside
[25:02] of them right all right now it says that
[25:10] he has risen all right we've covered
[25:15] that part that was what we're talking
[25:16] about sunday he is risen but what about
[25:20] jumping 2,000 years and reading again
[25:26] that he has risen and to find it says he
[25:28] has risen again I haven't left the point
[25:35] i told you i would just take this junk
[25:37] messages here backwards and forth and
[25:39] preach on but I will follow you I
[25:41] wouldn't lower myself to sleep to think
[25:43] that I've left the topic very much I'm
[25:46] still driving my best to try to get you
[25:48] to see who you are and what's taking
[25:50] place in your life and that'll be the
[25:53] rest of it don't matter anymore I
[25:55] preacher or dont preach but what about
[25:58] now it says he is risen now that's been
[26:01] enough to hold mankind right that's been
[26:06] enough to hold the ages in mankind in a
[26:09] position to work that something could
[26:12] take place and it would have to take
[26:15] place in the life stage all right now
[26:21] they said we read to mark and we've seen
[26:26] where it come down and how did it comes
[26:28] to a place alright a place was spoken up
[26:33] back there that would take place in this
[26:35] end time all right now can we find that
[26:41] in time in the scriptures and talk about
[26:44] it you know what we just believe it well
[26:53] yeah that might be all right but don't
[26:56] put me on the roads yet our plane to fly
[26:59] me across the country or something that
[27:00] you just believe might work okay I'm not
[27:05] going I'll just stay where I'm at I
[27:08] ain't gonna get on the plane we that you
[27:10] think you can fly or you think it'll
[27:12] work I want something sewer right I want
[27:18] something tried and see that's why it is
[27:21] that the flight and our plane is the
[27:23] safest thing there is a lot safer than
[27:25] an automobile come on out of all of the
[27:30] bomb blowed up and blow 2 planes apart
[27:34] you take all of that off and you got
[27:37] down to a small amount of desk from
[27:38] planes of
[27:39] normal things that take place you know
[27:45] well what are you getting at well you
[27:49] know it was spoken of dire in the
[27:51] scriptures as we read that he has risen
[27:55] and then you move over into the writings
[28:01] in the scriptures after about somewhere
[28:03] in the neighborhood of three years of
[28:05] Jesus's ministry and he comes to another
[28:08] place and it says again a very
[28:11] outstanding thing to us right let's go
[28:15] to Matthew 17 let's just read it let's
[28:20] start think about this of what this day
[28:23] an hour that we're living looks it after
[28:30] six days Jesus taking Peter James and
[28:32] John they would bring them up into a
[28:34] high mountain apart you know what a
[28:35] story of three heavenly witnesses three
[28:38] earthly witnesses we know the whole
[28:39] story right and was transfigured before
[28:42] them are transformed if you look it up
[28:45] and his face did shine as the Sun and
[28:48] his raiment was white as wool what is a
[28:51] lot and behold our period until him
[28:54] Moses and the lies talking with him the
[28:59] answer Peter and said unto Him Lord it
[29:01] is good for us to be here if thou wilt
[29:04] let us make here the make three type of
[29:07] nikon 1 could be one for moes 14 light
[29:09] us that's as well common things while he
[29:12] had spake behold a bright cloud
[29:14] overshadowed them and behold a voice out
[29:17] of the cloud which said this is my
[29:19] beloved Son in whom I well pleased here
[29:23] you him and when the disciples heard it
[29:30] they fell on their face was so afraid
[29:32] and Jesus came and touched them and said
[29:35] arise and be not afraid and when they
[29:38] lifted up their eyes they saw no man
[29:40] save users only and they came down for
[29:43] the mountain Jesus charged in saying
[29:45] tell the vision to know man
[29:51] what until the Son of Man be risen again
[29:56] from the dead he said well they just
[30:00] messed up by the wording there you know
[30:02] it should have been saying that Jesus
[30:05] would raise he said it specifically he
[30:11] said there's something that you went
[30:13] through and he called it a vision and he
[30:17] said now you go back down remember this
[30:22] was also before they had the newburgh
[30:25] right this was also before they had
[30:30] received Christ into their soul and
[30:32] heart but yet they understood something
[30:35] marvelous had taken place and they said
[30:42] he said don't television what vision
[30:48] what was the vision the vision was that
[30:53] they saw Jesus they saw Moses and they
[30:59] saw lies which is Elijah huh but that's
[31:07] where I emphasized when I said it you
[31:09] know it was transfigured look it up he
[31:13] was transformed right before them he was
[31:17] transformed the Prophet would call it
[31:18] into a glorified condition what about a
[31:24] vision that would cover these things
[31:29] what about a vision and watch a vision
[31:35] that has never been known until this
[31:41] time
[31:46] they were told to not tell the vision
[31:51] now you know yourself the mark wasn't
[31:56] Derek or we know that for riding you
[31:58] coming over the other the Matthew was
[32:00] dire all right but you know yourself
[32:02] even after he received the new work even
[32:07] after Peter would call it the holy
[32:10] mountain you remember that the scripture
[32:13] when he referred back to mount
[32:15] Transfiguration he called it the holy
[32:17] mountain and tall of the things that he
[32:21] had seen while they were dire but how
[32:27] much difference was it in it if you have
[32:30] a vision and don't get the
[32:31] interpretation of the vision right
[32:37] remember a vision a dream loans of
[32:41] dreams interpreted division okay where
[32:42] we're with it a king one time had a
[32:45] dream they didn't do the dream and he
[32:49] told a dream but he didn't know what to
[32:52] dream was right so now Jesus is
[32:59] literally telling them don't tell this
[33:00] vision to no one I'm not going off on
[33:06] the Lord and his ways of doing that just
[33:09] remember they couldn't understand the
[33:10] vision that's the point they go tell
[33:16] somebody they say you know what we
[33:19] thought we was up there we saw a vision
[33:21] they don't you think they went and cold
[33:24] what happened over and over and over
[33:26] throughout their times and their journey
[33:30] am i right would you if you have been
[33:35] Peter or if you have been James or John
[33:39] Matthew remembers writing about these
[33:41] others but what if you were Peter James
[33:45] or John that act literally would dire
[33:48] you mean they never said another word no
[33:52] we can't talk about that
[33:58] I think they went home probably told her
[33:59] the South was about it wouldn't you told
[34:04] what happened they said what happened
[34:05] then we don't know listen as the King
[34:12] saw the seven you know fat cows and then
[34:18] he saw seven skinny cows he just didn't
[34:22] know what you meant but he could tell
[34:24] exactly what the vision was right so
[34:30] could Peter them and so they probably
[34:32] did but there was something that
[34:36] couldn't tell what was that what the
[34:41] vision was about they couldn't tell what
[34:48] the vision was pertaining to so what did
[34:52] he say go talk about it go discuss it go
[34:58] all into we said just remember L
[35:01] division to know man until the Son of
[35:07] Man be risen again we know at that time
[35:12] he hadn't raised the first time right
[35:18] well I right this is for the
[35:20] resurrection of death and do it right he
[35:24] hadn't even raised the first time why
[35:27] would it say until the Son of Man be
[35:31] risen again these are sea vision
[35:34] interpretation right now we know that in
[35:45] that speaking dire that it brought him
[35:49] to a position we know that in Matthew on
[35:54] the River Jordan many things happened
[36:01] and they told it they wrote it they
[36:04] talked about it all right
[36:08] true and a boy spoke from heaven said
[36:11] this is my beloved son there's talk
[36:17] there in Matthew no Matthew three it
[36:23] stopped it would declare this is my
[36:28] beloved son just as it would declare in
[36:31] Matthew 17 but he said this is my son
[36:36] whom I'm pleased to dwell so we know
[36:40] immediately it's going to talk about
[36:42] adoption and remember adoption was one
[36:48] of the mysteries that it would have to
[36:53] wait until the end time for a profit to
[36:57] come to bring that understanding sure
[37:02] they could talk about it but that's what
[37:04] I just got to say and laying the point
[37:05] down truly Peter James and John came
[37:09] back telling the disciples about what
[37:12] happened after this experience which
[37:16] they didn't know what it meant now one
[37:23] of the reasons they didn't know what it
[37:24] meant is because it's in a two-fold
[37:30] meaning he's in a two-fold meaning of
[37:34] this Mount of Transfiguration experience
[37:39] now remember right point mark covers to
[37:46] the point of the resurrection he covers
[37:48] the Ascension he covers the preaching of
[37:52] the gospel through the two thousand
[37:54] years because he said and he went forth
[37:56] with signs following but there's two
[38:04] things to be involved to get the right
[38:07] understanding
[38:13] now what is it cover all right we know
[38:21] the prophets message so we say we have
[38:23] the interpretation all right I'll agree
[38:26] with you now we have what the Prophet
[38:28] had decided I asked to do we have it by
[38:32] revelation but still we've got it at
[38:34] least by intellect all right now will
[38:37] read in a minute where brother branham
[38:39] said and we all knew that the
[38:41] denominations knew that they knew that
[38:46] when you covering the transfiguration
[38:49] and the moses analyze even though they
[38:51] couldn't get it figure out with you
[38:52] water or whatever they knew that it was
[38:55] speaking of his second coming because
[39:05] what is going to be the finish of the
[39:07] second coming of jesus christ it's going
[39:13] to be through moses and elijah run the
[39:21] two witnesses to Israel there's your
[39:25] second coming of Jesus Christ to Israel
[39:34] primax is in his physical second coming
[39:38] to Israel in the Millennium which he
[39:43] will come back literally so then you see
[39:48] that the Scriptures has got to be
[39:50] something about it because jesus said
[39:52] don't tell his vision of no man don't
[39:58] try to figure it out leave it alone
[40:03] until the Son of Man be risen again when
[40:13] he was he going to raise again
[40:20] to Israel the resurrection of the word
[40:26] of God alive word going to Israel
[40:29] through two witnesses will be the second
[40:33] coming of Jesus Christ to Israel
[40:37] brightly as I said will climax in the
[40:42] Millennium as a personal play and their
[40:45] words a physical Lord Jesus Christ son
[40:49] of man standing on earth in the
[40:52] Millennium declaring himself to his
[40:56] realism son David of course he'll be son
[41:00] of god son dimensional data right all
[41:03] right you didn't speak civilly Second
[41:08] Coming that's what I said Wade picked up
[41:09] part I'm just trying to bring it a
[41:11] little different way to think about it
[41:15] all right they said in other words that
[41:20] we're thinking it and brother Brennan in
[41:21] other words i'm picking up your talks
[41:22] you can say he said I know these
[41:24] brothers sitting here said we know this
[41:26] litter listen really pertains to the
[41:29] second coming so that's the second
[41:41] coming to Israel is when we get out of
[41:45] here through two witnesses they'll take
[41:50] the word of God this message which is
[41:54] into our Bible take it to Israel and
[42:00] they'll tell Israel according to about
[42:03] the last part of the seal book Seventh
[42:05] Seal a thing did L tell them you missed
[42:10] your opportunity it was for you and you
[42:15] turned it down you are now in the
[42:17] tribulation and will give your life
[42:19] because you turn down in other words
[42:27] there's no way for you to fully
[42:32] understand
[42:33] this vision that I showed you there's no
[42:42] way they could follow it go see it had
[42:51] another meaning they will have to fall
[42:54] in now it would be the meaning of the
[43:00] second coming of Jesus Christ and
[43:05] listened to these two stages to the
[43:08] bride and in the bride and many comings
[43:18] do we how he come first to redeem his
[43:23] bride he came next to reveal himself in
[43:29] the last days I'm paraphrasing it with
[43:33] the words of the Prophet but then he
[43:35] will come and in physical coming to his
[43:39] bride the second coming to his right the
[43:44] first coming was to make the pies our
[43:46] brain device the redemptive plan Israel
[43:51] won't catch that why because the vision
[43:57] is sealed to them the true is that
[44:04] simple terminology they can't see the
[44:08] vision so it doesn't matter if you tell
[44:10] it you could put it in book phone you go
[44:16] to Israel spread it out before them
[44:20] would it do any good brother Peregrine
[44:27] done a real good job of going to Israel
[44:29] and taking this message and putting it
[44:31] on the internet and our waves and etc
[44:34] but did it convert them know why because
[44:39] the vision is still sealed am i right
[44:44] because what did he say in Daniel
[44:47] the part way was picking up what seal
[44:49] division is that one of the six whole
[44:53] purpose the seal division all right they
[45:01] still feel to Israel the Bible says that
[45:03] they cannot see said because their
[45:05] hearts I'm paraphrasing Paul he said
[45:08] because their hearts are not turned he
[45:10] said but when that heart turns when that
[45:16] heart turns to them which would be God
[45:19] giving them eternal life after we get
[45:21] out of here it's going to open up and
[45:25] they're going to see the vision but what
[45:32] does that have to do to you and I do you
[45:39] understand we know the vision what was
[45:47] the vision they were sealed up why would
[45:54] Moses in the last dark who sealed up
[46:03] see they never saw his first coming i'ma
[46:08] true her eyes were darkened they could
[46:13] not see his first coming how could they
[46:22] see his second coming when the second
[46:25] coming is the bride coming of Christ am
[46:28] i quoting rid of random what does he say
[46:31] coming out of the church you see why is
[46:39] it eight there's no way now we can take
[46:42] this message that's what I'm saying you
[46:44] say just don't tell them well they
[46:47] didn't tell them nothing about this and
[46:48] all but we can go over there now we get
[46:50] them Jews together and say now we don't
[46:52] tell you about this and we want to tell
[46:55] you that when we get out of here in the
[46:58] rapture God's going to turn to you and
[47:03] he's going to open your eyes because
[47:06] Moses and Elijah is coming to you you
[47:12] think I'd listen to you but it is not
[47:16] that the exact vision that was seen come
[47:21] on let's see those scholars knew when
[47:23] brother Brown was bringing that only
[47:24] hear you hear message they knew what are
[47:28] you talking about in the basis of Moses
[47:33] and Elijah and that would be the second
[47:36] coming of Jesus cried they knew that
[47:37] that's why he said it he said I know
[47:41] this pertains our readers mean I know
[47:43] this pertains to the second coming of
[47:47] Jesus Christ to Israel but he said I'd
[47:52] like to take it in just another little
[47:55] way a little form i think he used to
[47:58] work and he said i'd like to talk about
[48:03] this a little and said now we know
[48:12] that Jesus went through the early stages
[48:15] of its life and went through it and come
[48:20] out as to be the River Jordan now watch
[48:27] and you'll see the vision will just
[48:29] unfold as our part see in their part
[48:38] it's like a man looking at Luther when
[48:40] he's standing there preaching the just
[48:42] shall live by faith glory hallelujah I'm
[48:45] sealed in the body of Christ and here
[48:47] comes a man it's Lily's life perfect
[48:49] lined up everything's right in order and
[48:51] he said I see it I see what you don't
[48:56] Matt lucker lucker said yes but said
[49:01] this is something that's coming from in
[49:03] my heart yours is coming to in your head
[49:08] one listen I say it VOC saw the vision
[49:13] but one got the interpretation when got
[49:16] to head knowledge of it you realize
[49:19] church what I'm saying that we're having
[49:22] this message in our possession we have
[49:26] the answer to all of the theological of
[49:30] whatever you would want to speak of of
[49:34] the religious realm of mankind we have
[49:37] the answer to all of it but you think
[49:41] they're going to lay down their thoughts
[49:42] and listen to you come on no they don't
[49:44] see the vision that's what we're going
[49:48] to do with for a second we're going to
[49:49] look at it and try to see there's some
[49:51] don't see it now we're going to look at
[49:53] it and see it this way come on Peter
[49:56] James and John before they're born to
[50:00] get experience there was no way they
[50:02] could understand that vision the best
[50:10] that could have done was said o Moses
[50:12] Elijah that's coming to Israel it was
[50:18] the best secular gun
[50:21] they had no experience enough to
[50:24] understand the vision I hope you're
[50:27] going to get it what I'm talking about
[50:28] why the scripture says tell the vision
[50:31] to no man until a son of man be risen
[50:34] again now listen then you know you don't
[50:41] like my terminology and I don't need it
[50:43] but I just land blunt so evidently the
[50:46] first resurrection didn't fulfill the
[50:49] entirety of the vision because we've
[50:57] done proved that Israel is part of the
[50:59] vision Moses and Elijah part of the
[51:03] vision huh come on it wasn't fulfilled
[51:08] their why would it say hold this until
[51:14] the Son of Man comes from we know Jesus
[51:20] Christ with Deeks on a man we know he
[51:21] raised from the dead and we know he come
[51:23] back into the church on the deputy
[51:25] college right but the second coming of
[51:30] Jesus Christ hauling them never fully
[51:33] understood they spoke of it prophesied
[51:38] of it cold about it but did they really
[51:44] understand it if he did what you need a
[51:48] property to come from what did you need
[51:55] a profit for if you already understood
[51:57] it well I'll tell you what I understood
[52:01] this I notice that another yeah because
[52:03] you read what the Prophet said
[52:10] volition
[52:16] there has to be something about the end
[52:19] time that there is going to be a
[52:23] resurrection that will bring a
[52:28] resurrection now set that away now now
[52:34] quote brother branham that he preached a
[52:35] sermon one time called what raising
[52:38] Jesus from history evidently even the
[52:46] people that were supposed to know cannot
[52:50] follow it because brother branham goes
[52:55] then he said let me take this as a
[52:58] little other in other words a little
[53:00] another way we know it talks about Moses
[53:04] and Elijah coming to Israel we don't
[53:08] have anything due to us like take it
[53:12] about something has to do with us and
[53:19] let's see what he's talking about all
[53:22] right so he said we go to adoption he
[53:29] said adoption then is covered here in
[53:32] Matthew 17 why would you go that way
[53:39] we've got the point we know the point
[53:41] it's all right you got the right answer
[53:42] because diary starts where he stated
[53:45] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well
[53:48] pleased here you him now listen the only
[53:59] way you're going to know what this
[54:00] vision is to you is to hear him he's the
[54:08] only one has the answer goes on let's
[54:11] see how can i go to prove it holy ghost
[54:13] is the only revealer of the word no
[54:17] madam can reveal the word to you no
[54:19] matter if he's prophet priest or king
[54:21] you can't reveal the word to you you can
[54:25] bring it to your knowledge and your
[54:27] understanding
[54:29] you can bring things you never thought
[54:31] of but you cannot reveal it then the
[54:41] Prophet says and we go it goes into oh
[54:44] there's a bunch of syriza don't hear you
[54:47] him you know different messages I would
[54:49] invite you to at least listen to some of
[54:51] them there is a massive amount of them I
[54:54] look good today I don't know maybe 10 or
[54:56] 15 messages or more that literally are
[54:59] your him messages you know and he's
[55:01] covering adoption all right well now
[55:08] we've got it with Jesus on the Mount
[55:09] Transfiguration as adopted he was
[55:19] transfigured he was young they looked at
[55:22] him and they saw it it didn't help a
[55:28] little bit because they walked down off
[55:32] that mountain just as much as a bunch of
[55:34] unbelievers as they wasn't it went up I
[55:37] know you don't like out that burned down
[55:40] in the human minds but it's true didn't
[55:43] it they were the ones who came down and
[55:47] still wondering if he was on restore
[55:50] Israel we should television in the man
[56:02] now let's read a little bit more go
[56:08] ahead we're over on number three brother
[56:10] which is Matthew 17 but there's a few
[56:13] more scripture as it goes with Matthew
[56:15] 17 and it is to just say tell the vision
[56:19] no man look at it as they came down to
[56:25] the mountain Jesus car than saying
[56:26] television and oh man until the Son of
[56:29] Man be risen again from the dead all
[56:33] right let's talk about him being risen
[56:35] again remains dead traditions and ideas
[56:41] did you know yourself what happened the
[56:45] early church started out right going
[56:47] forth with the word of God and he began
[56:49] to die and go diameter it had to for you
[56:52] and I to come forth as the seed we know
[56:55] that within him start Luther Wesley
[56:59] Pentecost he's one of them having the
[57:06] newburgh which they didn't see what is
[57:11] going on look what he says and the
[57:16] disciples look look at this story why we
[57:25] won't notice a Peter when an order why
[57:28] did he make that next statement Jesus
[57:34] told them simply don't television to no
[57:38] man until it's on a man be risen again
[57:44] and his disciples asked him saying
[57:53] you're telling us not to tell the vision
[58:00] why then say describes that Elias was
[58:05] first come then you're talking about the
[58:10] vision you're seeing Moses and Elijah
[58:13] and you know eliason and that's lot back
[58:17] and say but we just saw want to go Moses
[58:21] and Elijah and we've always had to
[58:24] understand it that'll ice is gonna come
[58:26] further right that's their understanding
[58:32] if you go over and ask them they'll tell
[58:34] you Moses precedes Elijah and that's
[58:40] what Israel is looking for they know
[58:42] Elijah has got to come they're looking
[58:45] for Elijah Reuben the very man that was
[58:49] guiding us told George this man could be
[58:51] the very Elijah this enter disciples
[59:00] after in order to ask him singing then
[59:03] waits once they describe to the last
[59:04] ones first gun jesus answered and said
[59:07] unto them a lot she'll first come and
[59:11] restore all things now he's speaking
[59:19] from back tire all the way down to here
[59:22] right read a lot truly shall first come
[59:36] that's kind of tricky like it was with
[59:38] what when he said don't tell the vision
[59:40] until the Son of Man be risen again that
[59:43] means there's something else to be
[59:45] involved so when they say but we thought
[59:48] a lot you was coming he said Elijah
[59:57] Elijah so first come he had already been
[1:00:04] and was dead by then right John would
[1:00:08] already dark and dad by this situation
[1:00:13] you'll restore all things we know the
[1:00:18] story right he went all the way from the
[1:00:20] DAR to come down to this day to see when
[1:00:22] it would be restored now listen what I
[1:00:26] say unto you that allies had already
[1:00:29] come and they knew him not would have
[1:00:36] done unto him whatsoever they listed
[1:00:37] likewise y'all show the son of man
[1:00:40] suffering men of them then the disciples
[1:00:43] understood these taken to them of John
[1:00:47] the Baptist John the Baptist was the
[1:00:55] coming of allies right with number four
[1:01:01] license of clarinet verses that he's got
[1:01:04] to come and restore all things if you're
[1:01:12] listening you're going to catch the
[1:01:13] vision the vision is finality shows
[1:01:21] Moses and Elijah going to Israel now may
[1:01:24] I quote bread around them do you need
[1:01:26] this one I'll be glad to find it he said
[1:01:29] Moses and Elijah was talking to Jesus
[1:01:33] telling him I how he was coming you need
[1:01:37] that one Moses and lives talking to
[1:01:43] Jesus about his second coming
[1:01:51] and you're he's explaining his second
[1:01:53] coming his second coming is in two parts
[1:01:59] first you're going to have to pick up
[1:02:02] John and move on look at that one second
[1:02:06] but then he's going to be the Elijah
[1:02:08] Elijah is going to come and restore all
[1:02:12] things if you're listening to me i'll go
[1:02:16] ahead and make the statement we're aware
[1:02:18] it up this message is the second coming
[1:02:22] of Jesus Christ to the bride because
[1:02:26] it's not a physical coming to her and
[1:02:30] it's not brother branham it's the
[1:02:34] message he brought is that cleared up
[1:02:38] enough look I want you to notice
[1:02:43] something because I know you don't
[1:02:45] always get my capital letters and then
[1:02:48] my different letters and bangs and it
[1:02:50] don't mean anything to you but I wish
[1:02:53] you'd look right up there it's something
[1:02:54] and the disciples asked him saying while
[1:02:58] then say describes that Elijah was first
[1:03:03] come but I say unto you that Elijah is
[1:03:17] in comfort aletter I didn't write that
[1:03:20] they called it off better than there for
[1:03:22] a problem there's any trouble seeing my
[1:03:24] Bibles go for you did you get what I'm
[1:03:28] saying they ask why didn't describe say
[1:03:34] that her life was come he said but I
[1:03:36] send you that Elijah who John the badges
[1:03:42] has already come when we got to do is
[1:03:49] get back up here to find this one now
[1:03:54] you're seeing the mystery Jesus was
[1:03:58] adopted that's the mystery
[1:04:03] why would he start dealing with the end
[1:04:06] time Elijah because without the end time
[1:04:11] Elijah the message there is no adoption
[1:04:13] for the body of Jesus Christ guards your
[1:04:18] vision that they couldn't tell because
[1:04:22] they didn't know it okay read number for
[1:04:32] whatever number four here um talking
[1:04:36] about many other things that steadily
[1:04:38] meant to come in the order of the coming
[1:04:40] of Christ will get the other in a minute
[1:04:43] where it says a second coming the first
[1:04:45] you've seen how the order was they seem
[1:04:47] Jesus which was to appear and then they
[1:04:50] seen the coming of the glorified Norfolk
[1:04:53] ation and Moses and lives the very order
[1:04:56] of the second coming then when they look
[1:05:02] back they saw Jesus only when they
[1:05:05] looked again he went up on the mountain
[1:05:10] he was transfigured those disciples saw
[1:05:17] his very second coming what is his
[1:05:19] second coming to Israel to Moses and
[1:05:23] Elijah they know they something going on
[1:05:28] and one of the disciples stops and he
[1:05:32] says but we thought a las was to come
[1:05:41] and we haven't seen him
[1:05:47] he made the statement he said al I shall
[1:05:50] come and restore all things pointing
[1:05:52] 2,000 years down the road then he turned
[1:05:54] around plainly said look the largest
[1:06:02] doesn't come that Elijah moans you
[1:06:07] comfort allows that letter there that
[1:06:08] Elijah meaning the larger that you were
[1:06:11] looking for the one you say allies must
[1:06:14] come that Elijah has already come and
[1:06:21] then they understood him speaking of
[1:06:23] John the Baptist so what is it Moses is
[1:06:31] alive they're very order of the second
[1:06:35] coming roll it on up let's go to Patmos
[1:06:39] vision 1962 see that was nineteen sixty
[1:06:47] and the three possible did see that snap
[1:06:50] on every something here which shall not
[1:06:53] taste death until they see the Son of
[1:06:55] man coming in his kingdom aren't that's
[1:06:57] him with his creature and they seem that
[1:06:59] the three went up on the mountain and
[1:07:01] seen him coming in his kingdom right and
[1:07:04] the three apostles did see just that the
[1:07:08] order of his second coming they saw him
[1:07:10] transfigured there on the mountaintop
[1:07:12] his raiment was blazing white in his
[1:07:14] face shine like the Sun at its zenith
[1:07:16] and there as he appeared to Moses and
[1:07:20] Elijah on either side that's exactly how
[1:07:23] he is coming again
[1:07:32] now remember the scripture want to go
[1:07:34] listen remember the scripture while ago
[1:07:37] what's it saying up here we thought
[1:07:41] alive yours to come he jumps 2,000 years
[1:07:46] and he said Elijah shall come and
[1:07:47] restore all things we said here's your
[1:07:50] Elijah what's this they're here and as
[1:07:57] better as he appeared to Moses and
[1:08:00] Elijah on either side that is exactly
[1:08:02] how he is coming again there's the
[1:08:08] Israel now watch truly Elijah will come
[1:08:13] and turn the hearts of the children ride
[1:08:16] back to the father's apostolic doctrine
[1:08:22] now which one of his comings is the own
[1:08:27] your he's on his second coming to Israel
[1:08:31] here he's only a second coming to the
[1:08:33] bride are you with me actually how he's
[1:08:39] coming number six here you him have you
[1:08:47] talking about adoption he he bringing it
[1:08:52] into adoption because listen only
[1:08:55] through adoption he's anybody going to
[1:08:57] be able to understand this vision the
[1:09:05] problem let me just make a statement
[1:09:07] when I understand it look glory without
[1:09:13] adoption being involved you can't
[1:09:15] understand the mystery that's the
[1:09:17] mystery that's being revealed then maybe
[1:09:22] you haven't been adopted you still love
[1:09:25] them and there aren't in your heart have
[1:09:26] you been like a separated person not
[1:09:28] been like it didn't maybe you haven't
[1:09:31] been adopted but once adopted for
[1:09:32] leasing the place in the body of Christ
[1:09:33] you're an heir of all things notice what
[1:09:36] God did to hear Sean God didn't ask them
[1:09:39] to do anything ask us to do anything
[1:09:41] that he would not do he took his own son
[1:09:44] who had been Toby
[1:09:45] you he was just a little before the
[1:09:48] cruise that's was just a little before
[1:09:49] the crucifixion everybody said come down
[1:09:52] the son of man goes to Jerusalem be
[1:09:56] delivered in the hands of the Gentile
[1:09:57] said don't tell the vision to anyone
[1:10:04] okay but while they were standing there
[1:10:07] God adopted his own son he's ours
[1:10:11] division hurry over shattered him and
[1:10:17] the Bible said that he put a robe on him
[1:10:19] and so much that his raiment shine like
[1:10:20] the Sun in extreme set up before
[1:10:23] heavenly witnesses before earthly
[1:10:26] witnesses no more said this is my
[1:10:28] beloved son here um whatever he said
[1:10:30] it's just as good as my word he was
[1:10:33] adopted jesus said all pires in heaven
[1:10:35] and earth he's given unto my hands
[1:10:36] there's the adoption of God's adopting
[1:10:39] his son man of Transfiguration is
[1:10:42] adoption you're not going to get to
[1:10:48] adoption and that's an Elijah comes
[1:10:50] first the order of the second coming to
[1:10:54] Israel is remoted and Elijah boat the
[1:10:57] order of the second coming to the bride
[1:10:58] of Jesus Christ is a dot is Elijah not
[1:11:01] dealing with Moses okay you walk with me
[1:11:05] let's get one more go to number seven it
[1:11:12] came down to the mountain Jesus charge
[1:11:13] and saying tell no man to tell division
[1:11:15] dunno man see don't tell this you know
[1:11:19] it but keep it to yourself hell no man
[1:11:24] division till the Son of Man be risen
[1:11:26] from the dead don't tell it he said you
[1:11:31] know it in other words they understood
[1:11:33] they saw what are you talking about
[1:11:34] their seen this happened over here they
[1:11:36] saw that happen over time today no need
[1:11:38] of you going down there and try to
[1:11:39] explain to them what you say because
[1:11:43] nobody's going to understand this until
[1:11:45] the end time that Elijah has got to come
[1:11:50] first if jesus said and restore all
[1:11:54] things so Elijah coming is proven
[1:11:58] the second resurrection is at hand the
[1:12:02] first resurrection was the Lord Jesus
[1:12:04] cried I know the scripture come on I
[1:12:06] know this the first resurrection second
[1:12:08] in the script second resurrection comes
[1:12:10] on over to the day at around we know
[1:12:11] that we're talking about to you and I
[1:12:14] they're talking about you and I see you
[1:12:18] had a resurrection when you got born
[1:12:19] again adoption will bring you to a
[1:12:23] resurrection or bring him to a
[1:12:25] resurrection again but it got to be
[1:12:31] Elijah can't be no other way it's got to
[1:12:36] be free or Elijah waited number 9 let's
[1:12:42] get this revelations chapter 4 this is
[1:12:48] what Wade was reading over in this place
[1:12:52] and he saw the coming are the rehearsal
[1:12:58] that's a physical coming it wouldn't
[1:13:00] taking place it was rehearsal you know
[1:13:04] what her arsenal is you're just learning
[1:13:06] your part you're practicing it wasn't
[1:13:09] seen expect our because they loaded up
[1:13:10] what I've covered your to see that it
[1:13:12] can't be finished because of Israel
[1:13:14] isn't even started hit the bride is
[1:13:20] dependent upon where Elijah could coming
[1:13:22] up when we play the lunch okay then we
[1:13:28] believe all he said or we believe what
[1:13:34] he said that I want to believe is right
[1:13:42] and what was the first the first thing
[1:13:45] he saw a reversal first thing he's going
[1:13:48] to come in with Moses watch him remember
[1:13:52] Wade Sunday representing the dead Saints
[1:13:56] that would be resurrected so now we're
[1:14:00] going to bring Moses and Elijah right in
[1:14:02] here with us because there's Moses
[1:14:06] representing the saints that are in the
[1:14:11] grave representative dead Saints who
[1:14:16] will be resurrected Elijah was standing
[1:14:19] there and I want you to notice what will
[1:14:22] take place there was Moses first that's
[1:14:25] all these six ages that they slept
[1:14:28] remember when down coming in six Church
[1:14:32] ages not only that but Elijah was our
[1:14:35] the messenger of the last days with his
[1:14:38] group of the transfigured the raptured
[1:14:41] amen now in the future of waiting to
[1:14:45] come in some standing here that will not
[1:14:48] taste death until they see the Son of
[1:14:50] man coming in his kingdom and they seen
[1:14:54] the rehearsal of it after this is the
[1:15:00] resurrection they saw a rehearsal of
[1:15:03] getting ready for number ten they don't
[1:15:13] hear um now I do know that these
[1:15:18] ministers behind me may be wondering
[1:15:21] because in top they talking about
[1:15:24] Matthew 17 round everybody would it was
[1:15:27] showing the second coming of Jesus
[1:15:29] Christ that's the real way to approach
[1:15:32] it because it literally shows the life
[1:15:36] thing that's going to take place right
[1:15:38] where it showed first Jesus glorified
[1:15:41] second the message to the Jews which
[1:15:44] will be the true prophets of Revelations
[1:15:46] 11 Moses and Elijah and then when they
[1:15:49] look like they saw Jesus on me
[1:15:55] the real approach because if we see him
[1:16:00] coming from here and going to israel in
[1:16:02] what takes place we come back and know
[1:16:05] that Elijah has got to come first
[1:16:07] according to Malachi you've got to come
[1:16:12] restore all things and we know that's
[1:16:16] already taking place right it
[1:16:22] represented a second coming first they
[1:16:26] look nice all Moses this is from here um
[1:16:29] it's number eleven who is returning the
[1:16:33] last days before the coming of the Lord
[1:16:36] listen let's read it and of course it
[1:16:39] did mean and it represents the second
[1:16:41] coming as we find that it was first they
[1:16:44] looked up and they saw Moses and Elijah
[1:16:46] who is to return in the last days before
[1:16:49] the coming of the Lord are the taking
[1:16:53] away of the remnant of the Jewish Church
[1:16:55] to preach to the three and a half years
[1:16:58] at the left and Daniel right it's got to
[1:17:03] come to them but that still ain't broke
[1:17:07] the vision to them yet but has it broke
[1:17:12] to you you know our full dependence is
[1:17:18] Jen cows our full dependences Gentiles
[1:17:25] is upon the basis of whether or not God
[1:17:28] will keep his word the best I can say it
[1:17:33] is what we know you will without Elijah
[1:17:42] to come in the last days to bring us the
[1:17:44] message there is no hoax of adoption
[1:17:50] because according to Malachi is to turn
[1:17:56] the hearts of the children back to the
[1:17:59] Father's right
[1:18:04] how did brother branham explain that 327
[1:18:08] church age book why do you say
[1:18:10] especially romelic I for revelation 10-7
[1:18:14] or what it says it will turn ours for
[1:18:17] the children back to the faith of the
[1:18:18] fathers and then he will reveal the
[1:18:21] thunders which is revelation contained
[1:18:22] in the seven seals and said it be these
[1:18:24] divinely revealed mystery troops that
[1:18:26] literally not rehearsing it literally
[1:18:31] during the hearts and the children back
[1:18:34] so that's in this message now watch as
[1:18:40] we end it we think about and we read
[1:18:49] Hebrews 11 40 huh and it says they
[1:18:57] without us cannot be made perfect we
[1:19:06] don't you read down through that in
[1:19:09] Hebrews 11 nourish all the way down
[1:19:12] except the last couple of verses is
[1:19:14] really dealing with Israel Oh today
[1:19:18] without us cannot be made perfect then
[1:19:22] we follow that over to the church ages
[1:19:24] and we bring it down through there and
[1:19:25] showing the church ages that the people
[1:19:27] have died and went on waiting and we say
[1:19:31] they without us cannot be made perfect
[1:19:36] you realize they can't be no second
[1:19:39] coming of Jesus Christ to the Jews
[1:19:44] unless he completes his second coming to
[1:19:49] the bride that's why I life had to come
[1:19:55] that's why Jesus said to the life shall
[1:19:57] come and restore all things no don't
[1:20:01] worry about it we don't have to worry
[1:20:02] about it's a promise the problem is we
[1:20:06] just may not be a part of it go we may
[1:20:08] not have caught the vision yet
[1:20:13] the vision of what's really going to
[1:20:15] take place now Jesus only spoke of it on
[1:20:20] Mount transferring to Russia the only
[1:20:23] type that are showed it it's your
[1:20:28] adoption in mind that has to finish this
[1:20:33] thing up well I just don't see it well I
[1:20:38] want to bring a little message I've been
[1:20:40] studying for months now that we we think
[1:20:46] that we could get good enough for God to
[1:20:47] be able to fulfill his word I wish that
[1:20:54] was true undo I wish it was true and
[1:21:03] within when you say I got you know
[1:21:04] believe it cuz there's another part goes
[1:21:05] with it if we're the only one that's
[1:21:09] holding off the Second Coming then what
[1:21:10] is it and if the second coming of Jesus
[1:21:16] Christ is the bride coming of Christ
[1:21:17] coming out of the church that's what
[1:21:19] your profits did what about it prophet
[1:21:29] said ain't but one thing holding off the
[1:21:31] coming of the Lord what is that was the
[1:21:34] readiness of the bride well we've had 50
[1:21:39] something years now 50 years dedicated
[1:21:44] especially for that no listen this
[1:21:47] should have never been for anything
[1:21:49] other than preparation
[1:22:01] what's going to bring Jesus Christ
[1:22:06] adoption in the Bride of Christ because
[1:22:13] that's what the vision was vision was
[1:22:16] don't show no man this no tell nobody
[1:22:20] about this adoption and how I'm coming
[1:22:28] but don't you worry about telling them
[1:22:30] said cuz I'm gonna be here myself that's
[1:22:34] the only thing that I've ever taught me
[1:22:35] only thing I've ever believed if you
[1:22:38] look up the word come when you go home I
[1:22:42] thought your prophet said 270 was a
[1:22:45] coming of the Lord and look it up enough
[1:22:50] until you finally find this definition
[1:22:52] the word come means to be here well
[1:23:00] that's just something you come up with
[1:23:01] well let's see you come on something
[1:23:02] like it right because that fits exactly
[1:23:04] if he's not here there's not going on
[1:23:08] going dire somebody's gonna have to get
[1:23:13] serious enough and call on God enough to
[1:23:19] bring it to pies because that's the way
[1:23:22] it has always been your prophet said I
[1:23:25] brought it to you are the other day in
[1:23:27] that message over and over the people
[1:23:29] crying out to God is one of make him
[1:23:31] fulfill his word maybe we're not serious
[1:23:39] enough i'll try to explain that the best
[1:23:48] i could do he's a day but one thing
[1:23:53] holding off for coming the lord that's
[1:23:54] the readiness in the bride so then we've
[1:23:57] had all these years to get ready we've
[1:24:01] had the message remember to everything
[1:24:03] later in our hand I thank God for
[1:24:04] everybody that has ever in any way home
[1:24:07] users and in any way or everything and
[1:24:10] tried to help me to understand this word
[1:24:14] I thank God for all that they've done in
[1:24:18] putting the books and the tapes and the
[1:24:21] things out to where we can get it I
[1:24:26] thank God for all of these it has had
[1:24:29] anything to do with allowing us to
[1:24:33] receive the word I might not agree with
[1:24:37] the way a lot of people approach things
[1:24:40] but I look at the ultimate end because
[1:24:47] see I still got that dog don't even try
[1:24:52] to tell the vision just let it go don't
[1:24:57] try to tell it until the Son of Man be
[1:25:00] risen again well I thought we believe
[1:25:04] the Son of Man was to be the bride of
[1:25:07] Jesus Christ in feminist form according
[1:25:10] to revelations 11 stint in the midst of
[1:25:12] selling over Tennessee like under the
[1:25:14] Son of Man heard about the pouch for the
[1:25:16] golden girdle I thought that was the
[1:25:18] finished form of the coming of Jesus
[1:25:21] Christ I thought to coming to Jesus
[1:25:23] Christ was coming in me and you have you
[1:25:31] caught the vision as the vision open is
[1:25:38] this message brought a vision to you no
[1:25:45] no I've never seen a vision the Bible
[1:25:49] says without a vision the people perish
[1:25:55] now that looks like it's God's fault
[1:25:58] because he's not giving you a lot a
[1:26:00] right to see a vision that's not what
[1:26:02] it's talking about if you don't have a
[1:26:07] vision yourself not to go out something
[1:26:11] you see but to have a vision within your
[1:26:15] heart in your life of what this message
[1:26:17] and Bible is the brain then will perish
[1:26:23] we'll just keep dying to see somebody is
[1:26:31] going to come that place right what we
[1:26:33] got brother somebody's gonna say I seen
[1:26:35] the vision may I said as we rented Peter
[1:26:40] got close close it when he was saying
[1:26:44] that about that holy mountain he said
[1:26:47] we're gathered about round about my so
[1:26:50] great a cloud of witnesses he said in
[1:26:53] other words my mind he said is going
[1:26:55] back to the day that I saw him on that
[1:26:57] mountain he was transfigured before me
[1:27:01] and now I have that man that was
[1:27:03] transfigured into my soul living by
[1:27:07] personal experience and I have a greater
[1:27:11] or what now within issue what do you say
[1:27:13] I have a more sure word of prophecy now
[1:27:21] what could be more sure than seeing
[1:27:23] Jesus on the Mount of Transfiguration
[1:27:25] showing the second coming showing all
[1:27:27] the times what could be a greater thing
[1:27:31] our vision to you why would he make that
[1:27:35] statement he said I have a more sure
[1:27:38] word I was there I saw that happen but
[1:27:41] I've got a more sure why because he had
[1:27:46] something inside of him that took him to
[1:27:49] a cross that hung him upside down he
[1:27:52] would not let him hang him the way Jesus
[1:27:54] was you remember the story was told of
[1:27:57] him it's just a story telling if they
[1:28:00] saw this man walking out of Jerusalem
[1:28:02] because it's killing him and they said
[1:28:05] where you going son leaving it aren't
[1:28:08] you Peter yeah
[1:28:15] within what hopes would there be for any
[1:28:19] of us if you're Peter to be able to
[1:28:22] understand that the stories told it's a
[1:28:25] story fictitious he turned around and
[1:28:27] went right back and gave his life what
[1:28:30] was the more sure word of prophecy and
[1:28:33] experience within his heart of the new
[1:28:38] birth that all that Bible speaking of
[1:28:44] what good is a Mount of Transfiguration
[1:28:46] and knowing all the ins and outs or this
[1:28:51] thing to finish it if you don't have a
[1:28:54] personal experience with Jesus Christ go
[1:29:01] ahead brother number six of the
[1:29:03] five-number see do you have a more sure
[1:29:06] word of prophecy
[1:29:08] [Music]
[1:29:34] body at all of us Baltimore
[1:29:38] no age factor and coming off but that
[1:29:41] don't have to be true cause I've got
[1:29:44] emotional word of prophecy I've got the
[1:29:46] word of my Master's favor they said by
[1:29:49] your stripes we are healed now lay hands
[1:29:53] with my brother agree that this problem
[1:29:55] will be gone from it because we know
[1:29:57] that it torments the technician time
