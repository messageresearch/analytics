[0:00] Something something
[0:03] happened and
[0:06] now I
[0:09] know he touched
[0:12] me and
[0:14] made me whole.
[0:20] And since I met this
[0:25] blessed
[0:29] savior. Oh, and since he cleans and made
[0:35] me whole, can you praise him tonight?
[0:40] Oh, I shall never
[0:44] cease to praise
[0:49] him. And I will
[0:51] shout while
[0:55] eternity
[0:57] rose. Oh yes, he touched me.
[1:04] Oh, he touched me.
[1:10] And
[1:11] oh, the door that floods my
[1:18] soul because
[1:21] something something
[1:24] happened. And
[1:26] now I
[1:29] know he touched me and
[1:34] made me whole.
[1:38] Oh. Oh. And I was
[1:41] shackled by a
[1:45] heavy
[1:48] burden. And I was need a load of guilt
[1:54] and
[1:59] shame. But then the hand of
[2:03] [Music]
[2:04] Jesus touched me.
[2:09] And now I am no
[2:13] longer the same. Oh, if he's touched
[2:17] you, just praise him. Oh, he's touched
[2:21] me.
[2:23] Oh, he touched me.
[2:29] and
[2:30] oh the joy that floods my
[2:37] soul. Oh, because
[2:40] something something
[2:42] happened. Oh, and
[2:44] now now I
[2:48] know he judged me and
[2:53] made me whole.
[2:59] He paid a debt he did not owe. And I
[3:05] owed a debt I could not pay. And I
[3:10] needed
[3:12] someone to wash my sins
[3:18] away. And now I sing a brand new song.
[3:24] It's amazing grace all day long. Christ
[3:30] Jesus paid the debt that I could never
[3:37] pay. Oh, and he paid a debt at
[3:42] Calvary. He cleansed my soul and set me
[3:47] free. I'm glad that
[3:51] Jesus did all my sins
[3:57] erase. I now can sing a brand new song
[4:02] is amazing grace all day long. Christ
[4:08] Jesus paid the debt that I could never
[4:15] pay. And one day he's coming back for me
[4:21] to live with him
[4:25] eternally. Won't it be
[4:28] glory to see him on that
[4:34] day? Now then we'll sing a brand new
[4:39] song is amazing grace all day long.
[4:44] Christ Jesus paid the debt that I could
[4:49] never. Oh, let's sing that last verse
[4:52] again. Oh, and one day he's coming back
[4:57] for me to live with him
[5:02] eternally. Won't it be
[5:05] glory to see him on that day?
[5:12] And I then will sing a brand new song is
[5:17] amazing grace all day long. Christ Jesus
[5:23] paid the debt that I could never
[5:29] pay. Hallelujah. So glad the debt's
[5:33] paid. I tell you, it's that day of
[5:35] Calvary. What a day that is. You can
[5:37] always drive that nail back on that day.
[5:40] take the devil back to what he did for
[5:43] us that day. Amen. Um, Brother Wade,
[5:46] would you come and lift up the offering
[5:48] this evening?
[5:50] I haven't used you in a while. So,
[6:13] [Music]
[6:19] [Music]
[6:22] Amen. You know, victory in Jesus the
[6:25] starts off saying, "I heard an old
[6:27] story." But I tell you, it becomes more
[6:30] real every time we just receive that
[6:32] renewing of the Holy Spirit and God
[6:35] quickens his word. It just becomes so
[6:37] alive to us.
[6:39] Amen. Oh, I heard an
[6:43] old
[6:45] story how a savior came from glory.
[6:50] how he gave his life on
[6:54] Calvary to save a rich like
[6:59] me. I heard about his
[7:03] groaning of his precious blood
[7:08] atone. Then I
[7:11] repented of my sins and won the victory.
[7:18] Oh,
[7:19] victory in
[7:22] Jesus my
[7:24] savior
[7:26] forever. He sought me and he bought me
[7:32] with his
[7:34] redeeing
[7:36] blood. He loved me air. I knew him and
[7:42] all my love is to him. He plunged me to
[7:50] victory beneath the cleansing
[7:54] flood. And I heard about his
[7:59] healing of his cleansing power,
[8:03] revealing how he made the lame to walk
[8:08] again. And he caused the blind to see.
[8:14] And then I cried, "Dear
[8:17] Jesus, come and heal my
[8:20] broken
[8:22] spirit." And somehow Jesus came and
[8:26] brought to me the
[8:31] victory. Oh,
[8:33] victory in
[8:35] Jesus my
[8:38] savior forever.
[8:41] Oh, he sold me and he bought me with his
[8:47] redeeming
[8:49] blood. He loved me and I knew him and
[8:55] all my love is to him. He plunged me to
[9:03] victory beneath the cleansing
[9:07] flood. And I heard about a
[9:12] mansion he hath built for me in glory.
[9:18] I heard about the streets of gold beyond
[9:24] the crystal
[9:26] sea about the
[9:29] angels
[9:31] singing and the
[9:33] origion
[9:35] story and some sweet day I'll sing up
[9:40] there the song of victory hallelujah the
[9:45] whole victory
[9:48] In
[9:49] Jesus my
[9:51] savior
[9:53] forever. Oh he salt me and his
[9:58] body with his redeeming
[10:02] blood. He loved me air. I knew him and
[10:08] all my love is through him. He plunged
[10:13] me to victory.
[10:17] Beneath the cleansing blood. All is
[10:22] victory in
[10:24] Jesus my
[10:27] savior
[10:29] forever. He sought me and he bought me
[10:34] with his redeeming blood.
[10:39] He loved me and I knew him and all my
[10:44] love is due him. He plunged me to
[10:51] victory. Beneath that cleansing
[10:57] flight. On top of Mount Zion is a

[19:24] back. Amen. Hope you're happy to be in
[19:27] the house of God this this afternoon.
[19:29] Amen. Amen. And so, let's just go ahead
[19:31] and go to the Lord in prayer. Lord
[19:33] Jesus, we thank you, Father, once again,
[19:35] for the opportunity that we have to open
[19:37] back the pages of your word, Lord,
[19:40] realizing, Lord God, that they're not
[19:42] written by just a man, Father God, but
[19:44] they were inspired, Lord God, by the
[19:46] Holy Spirit, Lord Jesus, who is the
[19:48] author of your word, Lord God. And for
[19:51] man to pan these things down, Lord
[19:53] Jesus, as they were moved by the Holy
[19:55] Ghost. And Lord, we just thank you,
[19:57] Father God, for for the opportunity that
[19:59] we have that we can see these things in
[20:02] the scriptures, Lord God, and and we can
[20:04] see the time that we live in, Lord
[20:06] Jesus. Lord God, we ask that you would
[20:08] just help us, forgive us for our sins,
[20:11] cleanse us, Lord, from all
[20:13] unrighteousness, Lord, let us, Father,
[20:15] receive something from you, Father, that
[20:17] we can take with us, Father God, and
[20:19] most of all, apply it to our lives, Lord
[20:21] Jesus. Grant, Lord God, we commit every
[20:24] request into your hands this evening. We
[20:26] pray for every sick one, everyone that
[20:29] needs any help, Father God, whether
[20:32] physically, financially, spiritually,
[20:35] Lord God, you know, every need amongst
[20:36] us, Father God. And I'm so glad that you
[20:39] do, Lord Jesus, because with our feeble
[20:40] minds, Lord God, we we're we're not
[20:43] capable to retain everything, Lord God.
[20:46] But you do, Lord Jesus. And you are very
[20:48] mindful of every need. And so how we
[20:50] thank you that we serve a God like you,
[20:52] Father. Grant that Lord Jesus, we commit
[20:55] ourselves now into your hands and the
[20:57] rest of the service into your hands in
[20:59] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Thank
[21:02] you, brother Wade, for the for the
[21:06] water. Amen. Well, we're going to go
[21:08] just directly to the word and uh I want
[21:11] to talk this evening about power over
[21:13] the man of sin. Amen. and uh power over
[21:18] the man of sin. And so we're going to
[21:20] turn to sec if you have your your
[21:22] Bibles.
[21:24] Um I'm like brother Chris Long. I also
[21:27] like to hear pages turned but
[21:28] [Laughter]
[21:30] uh but we got them here just for you in
[21:35] case you're not turning them. So 2
[21:37] Thessalonians chapter 2:es
[21:39] 1-7. The Bible says here, "Now we
[21:42] beseech you, brethren," this is Paul
[21:44] speaking. And we beseech you, brethren,
[21:45] by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[21:47] and by our gathering together unto him,
[21:50] that you be not soon shaken in mind, or
[21:53] be troubled, neither by spirit nor by
[21:56] word, nor by letter, as from us, as that
[22:00] the day of Christ is at hand. How many
[22:03] believe that? Amen. And uh it says, "Let
[22:07] no man deceive you." That was very key.
[22:09] And uh let no man no man deceive you by
[22:14] any means which is the same thing that
[22:16] Paul's saying here that Jesus told him
[22:18] in Matthew
[22:19] 24. Um let no man deceive you by any
[22:22] means for that day that day shall not
[22:25] come except there come there come a
[22:28] falling away
[22:30] first. Right? There has to be a fallen
[22:32] away first and that and then and that
[22:36] man of sin be
[22:39] revealed what? The son of predition who
[22:43] opposeth and exaltth himself himself.
[22:48] Right? So this man of predition is
[22:49] self-centered. who ex who opposeth and
[22:52] exaltth himself above all above all that
[22:55] is called
[22:57] God or that is worshiped so that so that
[23:00] he as God siteth in the temple of God
[23:05] showing himself that he he is God. Amen.
[23:10] You may be seated. Praise the Lord.
[23:13] Verse 5 continues, "Remember ye not that
[23:17] when I was yet with you, I told you
[23:20] these things, and now you know what
[23:24] withholdeth, that he might be revealed
[23:26] in his time." Amen. For the mystery of
[23:30] iniquity, uh, what's that word there?
[23:33] Iniquity doth already work. And this was
[23:36] Paul speaking this in his time. So that
[23:39] mystery or that spirit was already
[23:42] working in in the midst of the church.
[23:45] Amen.
[23:47] Because this spirit that Paul is
[23:49] speaking about is a is a religious
[23:51] spirit. It's not it's not uh it's not
[23:55] the drunker out here in the ditch with
[23:58] flies on his in around his mouth. And
[24:00] it's not it's not the the the the
[24:02] prostitute in the corner of the street.
[24:04] Amen. who's who you know who who does
[24:06] what she does, right? But it it's a
[24:09] religious thing because Satan is
[24:11] religious, right? And and we all know
[24:14] this. This is all message 101. I'm not
[24:16] going to tell you anything tonight that
[24:18] that that uh you don't you haven't
[24:20] already heard or don't know, but I'll
[24:22] just remind you because sometimes we
[24:25] forget about these things. And I believe
[24:28] it's very very important, especially in
[24:29] the hour that we're living in. And now
[24:32] ye know what withholdeth that he might
[24:34] be revealed in his time. For the mystery
[24:36] of iniquity doth already work. Only he
[24:38] who now letth will let until he be taken
[24:42] out of the way. All right. So um I guess
[24:46] if I if I wanted to start
[24:48] tonight, let me just say that that uh I
[24:52] know that most of y'all probably were
[24:55] when you were reading this scripture,
[24:57] you probably were thinking about a pope,
[24:59] right? You probably was thinking that I
[25:01] was talking about
[25:03] uh a a certain man, but in reality, you
[25:08] know, you could put yourself in that
[25:09] scripture, right? Cuz as Paul, I believe
[25:12] he's talking he's talking about himself
[25:14] more or or or to you first, you the
[25:18] reader, and then you know it will
[25:22] transition into a a physical
[25:24] manifestation. Because let me tell you,
[25:26] this flesh, this spirit, amen, that we
[25:28] wrestle with day by day, it wants to act
[25:32] like
[25:33] God a against what God has placed in
[25:36] you. Amen. As the seed word, amen, that
[25:38] he's that that's inside of you. Amen. By
[25:41] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, it wants
[25:43] to take over you. Amen. It wants to take
[25:47] over what God you see in the beginning
[25:50] Adam and Eve when they came u in the
[25:52] garden of Eden. See they they they they
[25:54] knew they they they had control over
[25:57] over nature. They had they had they had
[25:59] power. Amen. Adam had full power over
[26:02] this earth and he had the knowledge of
[26:05] God. Amen. And I believe it's the same
[26:07] thing. That's why I titled it I titled
[26:09] this message power over the man of sin.
[26:11] Amen. Because we have that power in this
[26:15] in this day. Amen. Through that Genesis
[26:17] 1:26. Amen. It takes us back our soul
[26:20] back to that Eden condition. Amen. Where
[26:23] we have uh where we have power and we
[26:25] know we know amen what the scripture
[26:28] says and it tells us amen. We know what
[26:31] will happen in the future because we
[26:33] have the revelation of God in this hour.
[26:35] Amen. Through a prophet. But you see
[26:38] Adam and Eve, they knew all things. But
[26:40] here comes the slicker. Amen. Uh, Satan,
[26:44] I apologize that I always say amen in
[26:45] between my sentences. It's just a bad
[26:47] habit. I'm sure you all are very used to
[26:49] it. So,
[26:51] but uh sometimes I go back and listen to
[26:53] my sermons and I'm like, man, I say amen
[26:55] about every single every single word.
[26:59] It's just a bad habit when you get up
[27:01] here. It's just
[27:02] like it's just uh bad habits coming. But
[27:05] anyways, you just pray for me. But any
[27:07] anyways, you know, I was listening to
[27:09] pre other preachers and and I realized
[27:11] they do the same thing, too. So, I don't
[27:12] feel so bad, you
[27:14] know. I don't feel so bad. That's right,
[27:17] brother. But Satan comes in and he comes
[27:20] in and he came to Eve in a religious
[27:23] way.
[27:25] And I'm just going to take try to take
[27:27] my time this evening. I don't want to
[27:28] rush. I'm not going to jump around hoop
[27:30] and holler. I don't feel that way this
[27:32] this this evening. I just want to
[27:34] discuss this. Amen. because this is what
[27:36] what I've been I've been dealing uh you
[27:38] know been thinking about you know
[27:40] especially with the modern events that
[27:43] that that we're that we're seeing in
[27:45] this hour. Amen. Because we are living
[27:47] in a very late hour. Amen. We are living
[27:51] in an hour. Amen. That we need to look
[27:53] into these things. Amen. And take them
[27:55] seriously. Praise the Lord. Take them
[27:57] seriously. You know some of us we grew
[27:59] up in the message. I didn't grow up in
[28:01] the message. I came in message later in
[28:03] my life and when I was 20 years old.
[28:05] Some of you all have. This is all you've
[28:07] known. So I have experience I've
[28:10] experienced what it is to live out in
[28:13] denominations and I've also experienced
[28:16] what it is to be a Catholic to be in the
[28:19] Catholic church. Maybe some of you all
[28:21] have have been that way. Um I know what
[28:24] it's like. I know what it's like to do
[28:25] first communion, to be baptized as a
[28:27] baby in the Catholic church. I know what
[28:30] it is to do catechisms. I know what it
[28:32] is to do all that stuff. So, I saw
[28:35] firsthand things that I thought were
[28:38] what you were supposed to do in life.
[28:41] You grow up as a Catholic, you just
[28:43] think that that's just how life is.
[28:45] That's why I have such a burden for the
[28:47] people in Latin America because they
[28:49] believe that that's that's that's that's
[28:51] what they need and that's all they and
[28:53] that's all they have. Amen. And so when
[28:56] they come into the message or when they
[28:57] become Protestants, that's a that's a
[29:00] thing that they have to fight that that
[29:03] hierarchical spirit and treating other
[29:06] people like the pastor of that church or
[29:09] or ministers of that church in the way
[29:12] that they would treat the priest at
[29:14] their at their Catholic church before or
[29:16] even the pope. You see, they have to
[29:18] fight that. So that's the reason and and
[29:20] a lot of lat Latin people know that
[29:23] especially these preachers that know
[29:24] that and they know that they take
[29:26] advantage of that for the people and
[29:29] they take advantage of them and I and I
[29:31] I fight that with all my heart because I
[29:33] believe that that's wrong you know and
[29:36] there's still men today I'm not going to
[29:38] call names but there's still men today
[29:40] that that act just like popes before the
[29:42] people you see and they're supposed to
[29:45] be in the message but anyways so this is
[29:48] how Satan came in so sly, so sneaky uh
[29:52] to Eve and and the day and he didn't
[29:55] come to her with with uh lies and and
[29:58] just uh you know, you know, just just a
[30:02] slobbering at the mouth and with horns
[30:05] and and and and you know, some some
[30:07] dirty old guy. But he came to her in a
[30:10] very sly, sleek way. Amen. And that's
[30:14] how Satan always works. Amen. He's he's
[30:16] very clean. He's very He's a gentleman.
[30:20] He's very gentleike. He has his hair
[30:22] parted very nicely. He is He's very uh
[30:25] He smells really good. I I've mentioned
[30:27] these things before, you know. He He's
[30:29] got the best cologne, you know. He I
[30:31] mean, he he's nice. He's a nice guy. And
[30:34] that's why I say young young sisters,
[30:36] Amen. You be careful with the with the
[30:38] with the really slick Amen. They'll come
[30:41] in and they'll they'll say enough words
[30:44] of from the Bible and maybe a quote or
[30:46] two to just get you, you know, uh very
[30:50] comfortable and and and and and maybe
[30:52] get their the parents comfortable, too.
[30:54] You see, just enough word, you know, uh
[30:57] but he doesn't have he hasn't really had
[31:00] that true experience with God. Amen. He
[31:03] hasn't been in the Holies of Holies.
[31:05] Amen. The way he needs to be. All he has
[31:08] is is up here. But that's enough to
[31:10] deceive you. Because what you're looking
[31:13] for, young sisters, amen, you're looking
[31:15] for someone to love to love you. He's so
[31:19] cute and so and you're saying you fall
[31:22] for it so easily.
[31:24] And saying that when you're mixing it
[31:25] with with with with religious things,
[31:28] amen, just one word, amen, from the
[31:30] Bible, that's enough. That he's got the
[31:33] Holy Ghost. No, he
[31:36] doesn't. Amen. He just has knowledge and
[31:40] knowledge puffth
[31:41] up. Knowledge doesn't give you the Holy
[31:44] Ghost. Amen. Knowledge is Knowledge will
[31:48] take you up to a certain point. Amen.
[31:50] But an experience, amen, takes you the
[31:52] rest of the way through. Amen. Praise
[31:54] the Lord Jesus. And experience stays
[31:56] with you and it's lifechanging. Amen. It
[32:00] is lifechanging. Praise the Lord Jesus.
[32:03] So, I'm getting off topic here, but this
[32:06] is all Satan in this hour, saints. So,
[32:08] you see, Paul says here, uh, and so when
[32:11] Satan came to Eve, he came to her with
[32:15] 99.9% word. Amen. Brother Brandham said
[32:18] that it's just that 1%, Amen, or that
[32:22] point that that tenth of a of a percent
[32:25] of of of that was a that was a lie.
[32:29] Amen. And that's exactly what a good
[32:32] deceiver does. Amen. A good deceiver
[32:36] does not give you 50% lies or 25% lies
[32:39] and the rest truth. Amen. A good
[32:41] deceiver gives you almost the whole
[32:43] truth. Amen. Amen. But that but that is
[32:46] that that little bit that is very
[32:49] indistinguishable that that is what gets
[32:52] you. Amen. And that's where it will put
[32:54] you either in at faith or doubt. Amen.
[32:57] Amen. will either doubt the word or have
[32:59] faith in the word. And if J and and if
[33:01] Eve would have just had faith in what
[33:04] God had already told her in the word of
[33:06] God, Amen. then she wouldn't have been
[33:08] looking for something new. Satan was
[33:11] coming into her tell telling her, "Hey,
[33:14] you will become like gods, knowing good
[33:17] and evil." Amen. But see, they were
[33:20] already gods.
[33:22] They had they had eternal life. They
[33:24] were they were God here on earth. But
[33:27] Satan in his process was making her
[33:29] think that you didn't know. You don't
[33:31] know enough. You see, and God is trying
[33:34] to hide something from you. And so
[33:37] here's this here, right? And and and so
[33:40] we know that that she believed it and we
[33:42] know what happened afterwards. And so
[33:45] that is what Paul is saying here. And it
[33:47] it says that let no man no man deceive
[33:50] you by any means for that day shall not
[33:54] come except there come a fallen away
[33:57] first. And I believe that we're seeing
[33:59] that in this hour. Amen. Not just in the
[34:03] in the in in in amongst our ranks. Amen.
[34:07] But we're seeing it and we've been
[34:08] seeing it for a long long time that the
[34:12] Protestants church uh uh the Christian
[34:16] church is really in the hour in this
[34:19] hour is becoming for lack of a better
[34:22] term is becoming a joke to the people.
[34:24] Right. Amen. Amen. And I believe
[34:28] that, forgive me, you this is what this
[34:31] is what I believe. And so you don't have
[34:34] to accept it, but I believe that they're
[34:37] allowing that and doing that for for a
[34:39] reason and deliberately. That's why you
[34:42] constantly get bombarded with videos on
[34:44] YouTube and suggestive videos about look
[34:47] at them jumping on trampolines in this
[34:49] church and uh uh playing football with
[34:53] the Bible in the church and uh uh the
[34:56] preacher coming down from a from a a
[35:00] what is that called? Yeah, a harness
[35:02] coming down pretending like he's g like
[35:05] Jesus or something. And and it's just
[35:07] games and frolic now in the church. The
[35:10] purpose for that, the purpose for that
[35:12] is to make Christianity look
[35:15] bad. So that people now, young people,
[35:18] if you ask young people now and uh my
[35:21] wife has a friend up in Canada who has
[35:23] been going through these through these
[35:25] stages of, oh, I I I was I was a Baptist
[35:28] or or or or she was going to different
[35:30] churches, but then now she has settled
[35:34] for the Catholic Church because the
[35:37] Catholic church now is like they mean
[35:40] they're they're real, you know, they're
[35:42] the real thing and and so it's making
[35:46] fun of us so that the people can turn to
[35:49] something that's supposedly real, which
[35:51] is exactly what they've been wanting to
[35:53] do since the beginning.
[35:56] Amen. And and Trump is there to
[36:00] facilitate that in a very very very easy
[36:03] way. I'm I'm not bashing Trump. I know I
[36:05] get in trouble when I say Trump all
[36:07] of you to understand that I am not a
[36:10] Democrat. I am not a Republican. The
[36:12] last time I voted was in 2012 and that
[36:15] was for Congressman Ron Paul who was a
[36:19] true I believe was a true statesman. I'm
[36:21] not even a politician but he but he he
[36:24] he he really but he didn't get elected.
[36:27] You see he didn't get elected and you
[36:29] you almost wonder why but you see
[36:32] there's there's uh uh there's the that
[36:36] is exactly what is happening in this
[36:38] hour. Absolutely. See, and people don't
[36:41] like to hear that, but it's the truth
[36:43] anyhow because that is that is the
[36:46] reason why he has been placed there.
[36:48] Yes, sir. Amen. To facilitate that
[36:50] connection between the Catholic Church
[36:53] and to make United States the the the
[36:56] image to the beast. Amen. Amen. Now,
[37:00] Trump may not know that and and but but
[37:02] but but I believe that that's exactly
[37:05] what he's being he's put there for.
[37:07] Amen. It doesn't make him a bad a bad
[37:09] man. It doesn't make him a good man. It
[37:12] just makes him him that he's there
[37:13] fulfilling scriptures.
[37:15] And uh and uh but I'm not going to get
[37:19] caught up in the politics of it. And you
[37:22] shouldn't either. Christians don't get
[37:24] caught up in politics.
[37:27] Brother Brandham clearly said that.
[37:29] have. But you see, we've been in the
[37:31] last two or three years, we've been
[37:32] caught up with politics and the MAGA
[37:35] movement and all that kind of stuff and
[37:37] looking at the man, looking at the man,
[37:39] and you don't know what the man is doing
[37:41] behind the scenes to get you to be
[37:43] connected to the Rome to Rome.
[37:45] And so that's exactly what's happening
[37:47] in this hour. Yeah, he might be a good
[37:49] man, has a lot of money and and may have
[37:52] done good
[37:53] things, but he had a lot of wives,
[37:56] that's for sure.
[37:59] Anyways, but um anyways, so let let's
[38:03] just move on here.
[38:06] Um so people people get get concerned
[38:09] and they get scared, you know, because
[38:10] you talk about the coming of the Lord
[38:12] and and and things like that, but you
[38:14] know, I believe the coming of the Lord
[38:15] is a glorious thing. Amen. Amen. And 2
[38:19] Timothy 1:7 says, I hope you can read
[38:21] that. For God hath not given us the
[38:23] spirit of fear, but of power and of love
[38:27] and of a sound mind. Amen. So nothing
[38:30] that we are facing in the hour that
[38:32] we're living in is not for us to be
[38:36] fearful. Amen. It's not for us to be
[38:38] scared. That's right. And it's not for
[38:40] you young people to to to not think,
[38:43] well, I have no hope in this hour. I
[38:45] don't know what, you know, everything is
[38:47] finishing up. No, you continue. You
[38:50] continue doing what you're doing. You
[38:52] continue going to school. You continue
[38:55] uh uhh uhh uh playing basketball. You
[38:57] continue doing those things. Amen.
[38:59] Because a lot of these things we have no
[39:01] control over. But some of us as
[39:04] ministers and some of us as preachers,
[39:05] we like to look into these things. And
[39:08] it's our responsibility to tell you what
[39:10] we see. You take it for what you what
[39:13] however you want it. But our
[39:15] responsibility is just to tell you what
[39:17] we see. Amen. You see, so you don't get
[39:20] mad at the messenger. You just you look
[39:23] at it for yourself. Amen. But we are
[39:26] living in a late hour. We are living in
[39:28] a in in a in a in a detrimental hour.
[39:31] That that time for us as Americans and
[39:35] as the world to be frolicking and
[39:37] thinking everything is good and fine and
[39:40] and we'll always have money in the bank
[39:42] and everything. That's all ending right
[39:44] now as we speak. And so you're going to
[39:48] come to a point where you're really
[39:50] you're honestly you're truly going to
[39:52] choose how you're going to if you're
[39:54] going to continue serving God or you're
[39:56] going to continue serving your bank
[39:57] account. That's right. Amen. That's
[39:59] right. Believe that. Are you going to
[40:01] continue serving, you know, pleasure or
[40:04] entertainment because this thing is
[40:07] about to be finished up and it's not
[40:09] going to be. It's okay. Do do have fun.
[40:12] Be be I like to laugh. I like to joke
[40:15] around. I know you all some of Amen. But
[40:18] at the same time, I have to have these
[40:19] things in the back of my mind and not
[40:22] get so caught up in them that I'm
[40:24] forgetting, okay, what's going on? The
[40:26] scripture is being fulfilled right now.
[40:28] You see, because that's what Satan would
[40:30] like to do. What Satan likes to do is he
[40:33] likes to to blindside us with the
[40:36] entertainment and the and the and the
[40:38] and the things that we can obtain in
[40:40] this beautiful country that we live in.
[40:42] Right.
[40:44] I I I I I'll be the first to say I
[40:47] appreciate, you know, God placing me
[40:49] here in this in this country and and
[40:52] giving me the opportunities that I have,
[40:55] but I know that say that the United
[40:57] States has to fulfill certain scriptures
[40:59] in the Bible
[41:01] and whatever needs to happen to take
[41:03] that into play to for that to come into
[41:06] effect, then then so be it. And I cannot
[41:09] be blindsided from that. That's right. I
[41:11] can't I can't just dismiss that and say,
[41:13] "Well, you know, they can't it won't
[41:14] happen." You know, it will happen. It's
[41:17] going to happen. And then you have your
[41:18] young people and and and and children
[41:21] and grandchildren who are going to be
[41:23] here to see this. Some of you all may
[41:26] may be gone before then, but they're
[41:28] going to see this. So, it's our
[41:29] responsibility as adults to let them
[41:31] know to stay with the word of God. But
[41:33] anyways, Luke 10:19, "Behold, I give
[41:35] unto you power to tread on serpents and
[41:37] scorpions and over all the power of the
[41:40] of the enemy." Over all the power of the
[41:42] enemy. And nothing shall be shall by any
[41:46] means hurt you. Amen. Amen. And then uh
[41:50] Brother Brandham says this. He says, "I
[41:52] was talking about the coming of Christ a
[41:53] few weeks ago in a certain church and
[41:55] afterwards there was someone met me in
[41:57] the back of the church and said,
[41:59] "Brother Brandom, you scare people to
[42:00] death."
[42:02] That's what a lot of people say about us
[42:04] in this hour that we're living in. I
[42:06] said,"Wh do I do that?" He said, 'Well,
[42:09] you talking about the coming of Christ.
[42:11] I don't want to hear such things as
[42:12] that. This is what they told him. I got
[42:15] a little boy here I got to raise. I got
[42:17] I got a girl in school. And he said,
[42:20] "Oh, I said the coming of Christ is the
[42:22] most glorious thing I can think of."
[42:24] Certainly. See, the Bible said all those
[42:26] who love his appearing. Oh my. for a day
[42:29] that when this old mortal will take on
[42:30] immortality. Hallelujah. And this pest
[42:33] house that I live in will be changed in
[42:36] a moment, in a twinkling of an eye, a
[42:38] body like his own glorious body. Amen.
[42:41] It should be the heart's desire of the
[42:43] church. It should be every man and woman
[42:45] on fire preaching the streets and
[42:47] everywhere else trying to get souls
[42:48] saved. Certainly, I'm wondering if we've
[42:51] really tied to that absolute brother
[42:53] Brandon Mass that we claim to. Are we
[42:56] looking at the right morning star? He
[42:59] says, "Or if we're just trusting in our
[43:01] church and our
[43:04] denomination." And I let me just add
[43:06] that we can become a denomination to our
[43:08] own selves. That's why I'm saying Paul
[43:12] is saying, Amen. That man revealed that
[43:15] that man of sin. Amen. When he's
[43:17] revealed, he's a denomination to his own
[43:19] self. See, our our affiliation as the
[43:23] world changes, it changes with that
[43:24] round and round. Amen.
[43:28] So, so Paul
[43:31] continu Jesus said here in Matthew 24
[43:34] 4-5 it says Jesus answered see to it
[43:37] that no one deceives you for for many
[43:39] will come in my name claiming I am the
[43:43] Christ and will deceive many. Amen. And
[43:46] I believe in the hour that we live in
[43:48] and we're living in that hour. Amen.
[43:50] Amen. And in 1 John 4:1, it says,
[43:53] "Beloved, do not believe every spirit,
[43:56] but test the spirits." Amen. Test the
[44:00] spirits. You don't have to believe
[44:02] everything that comes to you. Amen. Test
[44:05] it. Amen. Test it with the word. Amen.
[44:08] Test it with history. Test it with with
[44:12] uh, you know, with what? With with the
[44:15] word mainly. Amen. Praise God. Those two
[44:17] things, Amen. will never clash. Amen.
[44:20] Amen. Beloved, do not believe every
[44:22] spirit, but test the spirits to see
[44:24] whether they are from God. For man, for
[44:26] many false prophets have gone out into
[44:29] the world. Amen. In 1 Thessalonians
[44:32] 5:23, for you are fully aware that the
[44:35] day of the Lord will come like a thief
[44:37] in the night while people are saying
[44:40] peace and security. Peace and security.
[44:43] Amen. destruction will come upon them
[44:45] suddenly like labor pains on a pregnant
[44:48] woman and they will not escape. Amen. So
[44:52] this is this is this here is the same
[44:54] scriptures there in second Thessalonians
[44:56] in the New Living Translation and you
[44:58] can read that yourself. So what is
[45:02] sin? Amen. And I apologize. I'm just
[45:05] going to do a lot of reading. I'll just
[45:07] let the prophet say it because he says
[45:08] it the best. But we know that sin is
[45:10] unbelief. Amen. And the Bible said in
[45:13] Hebrews the 10th chapter, he that sins
[45:15] willfully after receiving the knowledge
[45:17] of the truth, there remainth no more
[45:20] sacrifice for sin. Hebrews 10:47, I
[45:22] believe it is, there remain he that sins
[45:24] willfully. What is sin? Sin is unbelief.
[45:27] There's no other answer for sin. Amen.
[45:30] Drinking, smoking, gambling, doing evil
[45:32] things, that isn't sin. Amen. That's the
[45:36] attributes of your unbelief. Amen. You
[45:39] see when Eve when in Eve disbelieved
[45:42] God's word that is why she committed the
[45:46] act that she did. Amen. See, so it has
[45:49] to be in here. You have to disbelieve it
[45:52] first. Then it goes into action. Amen.
[45:55] Right. And really that is sin. Amen. So
[45:58] Paul is mentioning the man of sin. When
[46:01] the man of sin is revealed or the man of
[46:03] unbelief is revealed because as I said
[46:06] earlier, Amen. And that man of unbelief
[46:08] wants to rise up in in in each one of
[46:10] us. The man of unbelief says, "Well,
[46:13] I've known and I've been in this way for
[46:15] 20, 30 years, 40 years.
[46:18] What else do I need to know about God?"
[46:20] Yeah. Come on, brother. What what else
[46:22] what else uh uh you know, what else can
[46:26] I can can they teach me or what what can
[46:28] I be taught?
[46:30] Oh, but but but I believe that as long
[46:33] as you're here, there's plenty to learn.
[46:34] Amen.
[46:36] When you get to a point like that, Amen.
[46:38] then that's that man of unbelief, that
[46:40] man of sin rising up and you're coming
[46:43] against God and you're you're becoming
[46:45] God then to your own self. You're
[46:47] becoming your own denomination.
[46:49] It's what my denomination says.
[46:53] It's you see that thing rising up. Yep.
[46:56] Praise the Lord.
[46:58] So you you can't get comfortable with
[47:00] what you just learned or what you have
[47:03] been learning for the past few years and
[47:04] say that's you putting a period on that
[47:07] and not moving on with God. That's a
[47:10] denomination sir. You see? But you see,
[47:14] we're constantly, we constantly have to
[47:15] keep learning and constantly have to
[47:17] keep studying and constantly as many of
[47:20] us ministers here, we're always harping
[47:23] to you to do because there's plenty of
[47:27] revelation out there. Amen. We're not
[47:30] studying just for knowledge sake. Amen.
[47:32] We want revelation. Amen. Because
[47:34] revelation keeps us. Amen. And it and
[47:37] revelation is what will keep you in the
[47:39] hour of temptation. Amen. Amen. Praise
[47:42] the Lord. drinking, smoking, gambling,
[47:44] doing evil things, watching Netflix all
[47:46] the time or or binge watching, you know,
[47:48] Hulu or all that kind of stuff. That
[47:50] isn't sin. That's the attributes of
[47:52] unbelief,
[47:54] right? Because you don't believe, you
[47:55] don't think that you need to go be in
[47:57] prayer. You don't believe that you that
[47:58] you need to go and read the word and
[48:01] study. Amen. Hulu has taken over your
[48:03] life. Netflix has taken over your life.
[48:06] Uh uh uh YouTube shorts and and and and
[48:09] and all those things, they've taken over
[48:11] your life. Those are the attributes of
[48:13] you already getting comfortable with
[48:16] your own self.
[48:19] Right? I'm comfortable. I have a good
[48:21] church I go to. I
[48:24] uh I've been in this way for a long time
[48:27] now. There's nobody or nobody that could
[48:30] tell me, you know, anything.
[48:33] You're your own You're your own That's a
[48:35] Judas spirit. Amen. You're your own
[48:38] denomination. And that's exactly what
[48:40] Paul was talking about in second
[48:41] Thessalonians.
[48:43] But see, this this go it gets bigger
[48:44] than that, though. Amen.
[48:48] See, you do you do that because you're
[48:50] an
[48:51] unbeliever. If you was a believer, you
[48:53] would not do those things. Okay? It
[48:56] bears the fruits of joy, peace,
[48:58] longsuffering, gentleness, patience,
[48:59] holiness. That's the fruits of the
[49:01] spirit. But the fruits of the evil
[49:03] spirit is doubt.
[49:05] He that believeth not is condemned
[49:08] already.
[49:09] Amen. And brother Brandham said this in
[49:12] 1954 which is the same year he talked
[49:15] about that a pope coming from the United
[49:17] States. He said this. Then if the truth
[49:19] comes to you in such a way that you have
[49:22] a knowledge of
[49:24] it. I want to I want to reiterate that
[49:27] that you have a knowledge of it and then
[49:29] refuse to receive it. In other words,
[49:32] act upon it. Right. See, you know it's
[49:35] true, but but but yet your actions or
[49:39] the way you you you you live your life
[49:41] do not act upon that truth. There
[49:44] remains no more sacrifice for your sin
[49:47] or your unbelief. Amen. But a fearful
[49:49] looking towards the judgment. Amen. God
[49:52] have mercy that there will be no one
[49:54] person like that in this audience
[49:55] tonight. Amen. Amen. This is what
[49:58] brother Brandon was saying. Or nowhere
[49:59] else in the world would be my prayer.
[50:02] All right. So he that believeth on him
[50:04] is not condemned. And John 3:18, but he
[50:07] that believeth not is condemned already,
[50:11] right?
[50:12] Because he hath not believed in the name
[50:14] of the only begotten son of God. Amen.
[50:17] So sin is unbelief. But unbelief in
[50:21] what? Amen. Right. Now we we we we take
[50:24] a look at Judas. All right. Judas's
[50:27] scariot. He was chosen by by by by Jesus
[50:31] personally. Amen. Right. He was uh he
[50:35] walked with Jesus. He was also given
[50:37] power in Matthew chapter 10 against to
[50:40] heal the sick and to cast out devils and
[50:43] to all and to preach the word. Amen. He
[50:47] had power, you know, among along with
[50:50] all the disciples. Right. He was given
[50:52] the same thing. Amen. Amen. But there
[50:56] came a point in time where Judas, what
[50:59] he really was inside, what he truly was,
[51:03] eventually came forth. Amen. And and I
[51:07] was I was just riding down the road and
[51:09] just really thinking about some
[51:11] attributes about Judas. And there's some
[51:13] attributes of Judas, Amen. that are very
[51:17] interesting. And and and we can see here
[51:20] that he was the treasurer of the group.
[51:22] He was responsible for managing the
[51:24] money bag for Jesus and the disciples
[51:26] indicating a role of trust within the
[51:28] group. He was a betrayer of Jes of
[51:30] Jesus. We all know that. And and and he
[51:32] was also motivated by greed and or
[51:35] disillusionment. Amen. Uh the gospel
[51:39] suggests different motivations for his
[51:40] betrayal. John 12:6 implies greed,
[51:43] noting Judas's dishonesty with the money
[51:45] bag.
[51:47] Some interpretations suggest he may have
[51:49] been disillusioned with Jesus's
[51:51] non-political messianic role,
[51:55] expecting a revolutionary leader. Amen.
[51:59] He was disillus he he was disillusioned
[52:01] that Jesus wasn't into politics the way
[52:04] he wanted him to be. Maybe.
[52:08] Right. Right. True, brother. And so
[52:10] people sometimes they get upset with you
[52:12] because you're not in you're why aren't
[52:14] you into the politics the way everybody
[52:16] else is. I'm not.
[52:19] I don't have business in that. My
[52:21] business is the word of God.
[52:24] Politics will fail. Politics has fallen.
[52:28] Amen. Christian has no business getting
[52:31] into politics.
[52:33] And they'll get mad and and and and get
[52:35] upset at you, but it's the truth anyhow.
[52:38] Amen.
[52:41] So, here's some here's some attributes
[52:43] of Judas. Who the who who who is the man
[52:47] who is the man of
[52:49] sin? Judas was self-centered.
[52:53] He was
[52:54] greedy. He had love for
[52:56] money. He loved pleasure. He was a
[53:00] hypocrite. These are just things I was
[53:02] thinking about while we were My wife was
[53:04] graciously driving me to church tonight.
[53:10] He was anointed.
[53:12] He was anointed. Why? He was given power
[53:15] in in Matthew chapter 10 to do to do all
[53:17] those things. He had influence.
[53:20] He had influence. He was an eloquent
[53:22] speaker. Cuz I'm definitely not that. He
[53:26] was
[53:27] educated. He was very sneaky.
[53:32] He seemed reasonable.
[53:36] He seemed like it was reasonable. It was
[53:37] reasonable to, you know, why waste all
[53:40] that all that uh all that perfume when
[53:43] we could have sold it to and given it to
[53:46] the poor. That seemed reasonable. But
[53:49] instead, Jesus accepted, you know, the
[53:52] worship by a woman who who who who spent
[53:56] all kinds of money just to anoint his
[53:58] feet with that with that with that
[54:00] perfume.
[54:03] He was subtle. And remember who was
[54:06] subtle from the beginning. Amen. Amen.
[54:09] He was very religious.
[54:12] Amen. And he started off so innocently,
[54:15] right? Right. He started off very very
[54:20] innocently. But we know how he ended up.
[54:23] He ended up in destruction. And that's
[54:26] the reason why Jesus called him the son
[54:28] of predition. When you look that word
[54:31] up, pdition. Amen. It's the It's the
[54:33] word destruction, right? And we'll look
[54:36] at that here. Hopefully, we get some
[54:38] time. All right. So, Judas, he had an
[54:40] opportunity to have he had an
[54:42] opportunity
[54:44] uh you have an opportunity as well.
[54:47] Amen. Amen. Because even when they were
[54:49] there at the at the uh
[54:52] uh on the Passover or when they were
[54:54] when they were eating and Jesus was
[54:56] washing the disciples feet, Jesus Judas
[54:58] was there. He parttook of foot washing.
[55:02] He partok of communion,
[55:04] right? And Jesus clearly said that
[55:07] there's one of you that's going to
[55:08] betray me. And it's the one who takes
[55:12] and soops with me in the bowl. In other
[55:14] words, takes the piece of bread and
[55:16] there was a little bowl, maybe some oil
[55:18] or something. I'm not sure exactly. And
[55:21] who sops in with me at the same time.
[55:25] Judas was right there fulfilling that as
[55:28] Jesus was stopping there uhh you know
[55:31] dunking the the the bread you know kind
[55:33] of like the way some of us we dunk you
[55:35] know our bread and back in my country we
[55:37] used to take bread toast bread and and
[55:39] chocolate in the morning you know and
[55:41] dunk it in the chocolate you know Trudy
[55:43] knows what I'm talking about hot
[55:44] chocolate and we that's good stuff
[55:47] especially if it's got butter on it and
[55:49] stuff like that we dunk it in there so
[55:52] that Judas was Jesus was there dunking
[55:55] whatever he was eating the bread or
[55:57] whatever. And here comes Judas's hand
[55:59] doing the same thing with with
[56:01] Jesus. And that's why that's why brother
[56:04] Brandham said that there in the end time
[56:05] they'll be twins.
[56:08] They'll be doing the exact same thing.
[56:11] But one of them will eventually show its
[56:13] colors.
[56:14] They'll be shouting, praising, and
[56:17] worshiping God. And they'll be they'll
[56:19] be reading the same scripture you will
[56:21] be reading. And they'll be feeling the
[56:23] same chills and and and and things that
[56:26] that you feel and prophesying and doing
[56:29] all kinds of things. And Jesus at the
[56:31] end will tell them, "Depart from me. I
[56:34] never knew you." He really didn't need
[56:36] to tell them that cuz they will depart
[56:37] anyways.
[56:39] Just like Judas left, to fulfill what
[56:42] Jesus said, "Satan has entered into you.
[56:45] Go fulfill and go do it quickly." He
[56:48] said, "Right." And I say that the
[56:51] believe the bride in this hour. That's
[56:52] what I'm saying. Lord Jesus, come
[56:53] quickly. Amen. Let the people do what
[56:56] they need to do to show their true
[56:58] colors. Amen. And this nation is going
[57:02] that way. This world is heading that
[57:04] way. And we see it. Amen. In the hour
[57:06] that we are living in. Amen. All right.
[57:10] So, uh trying to move a little quickly
[57:13] here
[57:16] now. It was the uh religious influences
[57:19] that turned Jesus in. Amen. It wasn't
[57:22] the prostitutes or the drunkards of that
[57:24] day. It was the religious influences
[57:28] like the the Pharisees and the
[57:31] Sadducees that got in the way and that
[57:33] turned Jesus in in that hour, right? And
[57:36] of course, Judas joined right up with
[57:38] them, got money. Amen. And turned Jesus
[57:41] right in with a
[57:43] kiss. And you know, I I've always I was
[57:47] speaking to a talking to a brother the
[57:49] other day. You know, Judas Jesus knowing
[57:52] that Judas was the one who was going to
[57:54] betray him and yet Jesus treated him
[57:58] just like he treated the other
[57:59] disciples.
[58:01] That speaks that speaks volumes to me.
[58:04] You might know that somebody can be a
[58:07] trickster, a a a sinner, a deceiver, uh
[58:11] doesn't deserve to even you hold the
[58:14] door open for them or anything. But yet
[58:18] the love that's in because for God so
[58:20] loved the world. You love that person so
[58:23] much that nobody will be able to
[58:25] differentiate if he's a enemy or or a
[58:28] friend. That's right. And brother
[58:30] Brandon got to that point. I believe it
[58:32] was Bill Brother Billy Paul that said
[58:33] that he was so close to God that and
[58:36] treated everybody just the same. You did
[58:38] not know who was his enemies or who was
[58:40] his foes. I want to get that way. God
[58:44] help me. Amen. that there be a Judas
[58:47] right here that I know that's going to
[58:49] to to turn me in or whatever. Amen. And
[58:52] and and but yet I still want to go down
[58:54] and wash his feet. I still want to serve
[58:57] him communion. I still want to do Amen.
[58:59] the right thing. Amen. Why? Because love
[59:02] conquers a multitude of sins. Love is
[59:05] the most powerful force that you'll ever
[59:07] have. Amen. you you people that hate you
[59:10] and people that that curse you and that
[59:12] talk bad about you and that and that and
[59:13] that destroy you be behind the behind
[59:16] your back. Amen. When you come face to
[59:19] face to them and you show them true
[59:21] love, they don't know what to do. That's
[59:22] right.
[59:25] Amen. God bless you.
[59:29] But on Facebook, you know, oh, they'll
[59:31] they'll just or on social media, they'll
[59:33] just talk all about you. But when you're
[59:36] in front of them, they don't say
[59:37] anything. It was like a video I watched.
[59:39] I wish I could show it. I wish I had it.
[59:41] It was a little video of two dogs. One
[59:43] of them was on one side of the fence and
[59:45] the other one was on the other side of
[59:46] the fence. And they were mad at each
[59:48] other while the fence was
[59:51] closed. And then the the the owner would
[59:54] open the fence. As soon as the door
[59:56] would open, they'd
[59:58] stop. Then he'd close it
[1:00:04] again. And then he'd open the door and
[1:00:06] they'd stop.
[1:00:09] And then he'd do it again. And that's
[1:00:11] how people are with social media. But
[1:00:14] when you face them face to face, they
[1:00:15] don't want to face you. They don't want
[1:00:17] to say the things they talk about you in
[1:00:19] front of you because they just can't.
[1:00:23] That's why social media is so deceptive.
[1:00:25] We're not saying don't use social media,
[1:00:27] but social media leads you to become a
[1:00:29] hypocrite
[1:00:30] if you're not careful. Because you'll
[1:00:33] say whatever you want to on Facebook
[1:00:35] about anybody and have all kinds of
[1:00:38] dragouts with people on Facebook, but
[1:00:40] when you're in front of that person, you
[1:00:42] can't face that person. Amen. I want you
[1:00:45] to say the same thing you just said to
[1:00:46] me on Facebook.
[1:00:49] They chickenening out then.
[1:00:53] And so where was I going with that?
[1:00:58] With Judas. Yes. So the rel so it was
[1:01:01] the religious influences that turned
[1:01:03] Jesus in. Amen.
[1:01:06] I was going with that song. But anyways,
[1:01:08] take it for what it's worth. Don't cost
[1:01:10] you a penny.
[1:01:13] Now just trying to finish up.
[1:01:17] Um, we know that Roman Catholicism, it
[1:01:20] will rule the world.
[1:01:26] And uh I have several quotes here and
[1:01:30] and and several manly quotes where
[1:01:33] brother Brandham talks about that
[1:01:35] because I often wondered, you know, we
[1:01:37] always we always read brother Brandham
[1:01:39] and I often wondered why did brother
[1:01:41] Brandham was constantly downplaying
[1:01:43] communism during his time. constantly he
[1:01:47] would constantly always downplay
[1:01:49] communism
[1:01:51] and uh uh uh and saying that it wasn't
[1:01:54] it wasn't anything. It was just a tool
[1:01:55] for God. And so we were thinking, oh the
[1:01:59] communists of that day, Russia and the
[1:02:01] Cold War and all that kind of stuff, you
[1:02:03] know, and then here since uh we could
[1:02:07] just say since 2020, Amen. we we since
[1:02:10] our last
[1:02:12] president, we thought the same thing. We
[1:02:15] thought, "Oh, communism is going to take
[1:02:17] over
[1:02:18] again because here comes a story
[1:02:21] hour and letting uh hh uh drag queens
[1:02:25] tell read stories to to to kids and and
[1:02:28] doing all kinds of things that, you
[1:02:30] know, this country doesn't go for, but
[1:02:33] they were bombarding you with it in the
[1:02:35] news. And they were making the the
[1:02:37] president look like a fool on on on
[1:02:40] on
[1:02:42] TV. And to me personally, to me, all
[1:02:45] that was done deliberately so that you
[1:02:49] can easily accept what's coming next.
[1:02:53] Because if they didn't make Biden look
[1:02:54] like a fool, if they didn't make the
[1:02:56] people, you know, uh, story hour
[1:03:00] and people fighting against I'm not
[1:03:02] wearing a mask or I'm not taking a shot
[1:03:04] and he, you know, COVID and all that,
[1:03:06] all that stuff played into what's
[1:03:08] getting ready to come. Sure.
[1:03:10] To see how you were getting ready to to
[1:03:13] act when this true thing gets ready to
[1:03:15] come upon the people that was all just a
[1:03:17] test run for this root for this truth
[1:03:20] for this that that we're getting ready
[1:03:22] to read here in just a moment. The
[1:03:24] prophet talked about it.
[1:03:27] So it it it again that's just personally
[1:03:30] me.
[1:03:32] That's just how I' I've seen the things
[1:03:34] in the past five years
[1:03:37] or I don't follow the the the the the
[1:03:40] news the way a lot of people do, you
[1:03:43] know, take it in for face value. I I
[1:03:45] just don't I can't. I have to look at
[1:03:47] things according to this here. Amen.
[1:03:51] Then I can see, okay, that's playing out
[1:03:54] this certain way because it's got to all
[1:03:56] fulfill the word. That's the main thing.
[1:04:00] And it's got to fulfill the the the
[1:04:02] prophets the prophet the prophet as
[1:04:04] well. And we saw we know we we know this
[1:04:07] new pope that came in. He's an American.
[1:04:11] Now I told my wife that day it was May
[1:04:13] 8th when he was selected. I said you
[1:04:16] know he could have been selected that
[1:04:19] day and maybe had a heart attack and die
[1:04:22] an hour later. it would have still
[1:04:24] fulfilled that word
[1:04:27] because he was over there in
[1:04:29] Rome and he was a he was a he he came
[1:04:32] from the United States.
[1:04:35] So, uh, however it's going to play out,
[1:04:38] we will we will see. But I like what
[1:04:40] brother Wade has been saying and what he
[1:04:42] was saying Sunday, those are all just
[1:04:44] signposts.
[1:04:46] That is not supposed to give you the
[1:04:48] Holy Ghost.
[1:04:50] Signs don't take you to Atlanta. Amen.
[1:04:53] Sign the vehicle does. It's like what
[1:04:55] brother Wade was saying and I I love
[1:04:57] that analogy. Amen. It's the vehicle
[1:05:00] that you're in. This is the vehicle that
[1:05:02] we need to be riding in. Amen. The
[1:05:05] vehicle of the word.
[1:05:07] Amen. Not not not what not current
[1:05:11] events and and and technology and all
[1:05:14] kinds of stuff like that. That's that's
[1:05:16] just a bunch of distractions. That's
[1:05:17] right. Amen. That's in order to bring
[1:05:20] about mark of the beast and later on
[1:05:23] down the road. All right. Brother
[1:05:25] Brandham says, "Now he began by a
[1:05:27] religious deceit in Eden and has
[1:05:29] continued ever since. Not by setting up
[1:05:31] a bunch of communists. Communist has
[1:05:34] nothing to do with this. It's the
[1:05:36] church." That's where you have to watch.
[1:05:39] See, it's not the communists that will
[1:05:41] deceive the very elected. It's the
[1:05:43] church that will deceive the very
[1:05:45] elected. See, it isn't
[1:05:48] communists. We know they deny God. We
[1:05:51] know that the whole country knew that
[1:05:54] they people were not standing up. The
[1:05:55] majority of Americans weren't standing
[1:05:57] up for story hour and drag queens
[1:06:00] and all kinds of stuff. They know that,
[1:06:03] but they were making you think that
[1:06:05] that's what it's going to so that you
[1:06:08] can believe the lie. Amen. And then when
[1:06:10] the when when Trump comes on the in the
[1:06:13] picture and and and he seems so
[1:06:15] religious holding the Bible and he's got
[1:06:17] his Bible a Bible and you know the Trump
[1:06:19] Bible and and everything just looks so
[1:06:21] religious and so you'll fall for that
[1:06:24] especially the conservatives fall so
[1:06:26] easily for things like that
[1:06:29] because they're Christians and they they
[1:06:31] fail hookline and sinker. Amen. And when
[1:06:34] you tell them that they get mad. Amen.
[1:06:37] It's the exact same thing that was
[1:06:39] happening when you would call Karens and
[1:06:40] people with masks and stuff like that.
[1:06:42] It's what's happening now on the
[1:06:43] Republican side now. They're the ones
[1:06:46] who becoming the Democrats, but they
[1:06:48] don't know it. Right.
[1:06:52] That's exactly what they wanted. So that
[1:06:55] you could be deceived and taking you
[1:06:57] taking over to Rome.
[1:07:00] It's exactly where it's going. Amen. We
[1:07:02] know they deny God. Brother Brandham
[1:07:04] said they're antichrist. We we know that
[1:07:07] that that that they're antichrist. Sure,
[1:07:09] they are in principle, but they are not
[1:07:12] the
[1:07:13] antichrist. The antichrist is religious,
[1:07:16] very religious, and can quote the
[1:07:18] scripture and make it look so
[1:07:21] plain as Satan did back there in the
[1:07:25] beginning. Yep. He quoted everything
[1:07:27] right down. God has said, "Thou shalt
[1:07:29] not eat every tree of the garden." See,
[1:07:31] pulled her eyes. She said, "Yes, we may
[1:07:33] eat of all the trees of the garden, but
[1:07:35] there is a tree in the midst of the
[1:07:36] garden, God, even to touch." All
[1:07:38] right. Abraham continues says, "And the
[1:07:41] spoken word in the original seed." I'm
[1:07:42] going to read a couple of quotes here,
[1:07:43] so you just bear with me. There's no
[1:07:46] scripture that says communism will rule
[1:07:48] the world. But there is a scripture and
[1:07:51] all the scriptures said Romanism will do
[1:07:53] it. Right?
[1:07:55] So keep your eyes on that. Brother
[1:07:56] Brandham said,
[1:07:59] you see, and everything you turn now,
[1:08:02] it's a positive light on the Catholic
[1:08:05] Church now.
[1:08:07] Everything everything I mean, this thing
[1:08:10] is moving quickly.
[1:08:13] And because Trump endors it and because
[1:08:15] other not just Trump, but but but other
[1:08:18] other presidents in that are coming up.
[1:08:20] They're electing presidents in the UK.
[1:08:22] Uh they're having elections. Even in
[1:08:25] Australia, there are men that are that
[1:08:28] are that are that that act like
[1:08:30] Trump. Uh uh Andrew Tate, this this guy,
[1:08:33] he's try he's running for president. And
[1:08:36] he he acts like Trump. He he he he has
[1:08:38] that what what is that that charisma
[1:08:41] like Trump and and and there's another
[1:08:43] man in Australia who acts just like
[1:08:45] Trump, you know? Oh, he's laying it to
[1:08:47] the to the to the uh uh to the
[1:08:50] whatchamacall it to the I forgot the
[1:08:52] name of that that they call the Anyways,
[1:08:54] he's laying it to the system, you know.
[1:08:56] Oh, he's going against them, you know,
[1:08:58] just like Trump did. And they're putting
[1:09:01] all these men in in positions in
[1:09:04] politics so that they can bamboozle the
[1:09:07] people over to the Catholic Church. It's
[1:09:09] exactly what's happening. Amen. And
[1:09:11] people are not realizing. They're just
[1:09:12] caught up with MAGA, MAGA. Oh, maga,
[1:09:15] magga, magga. And and and this thing is
[1:09:18] going back to the Constitution again.
[1:09:20] Let me tell you what, things are not
[1:09:21] going back that way. This thing is not
[1:09:24] going back to the way George Washington,
[1:09:27] the days of George Washington, the days
[1:09:29] of Abraham Lincoln, brother Brandham
[1:09:31] said that clearly. But yet, people are
[1:09:33] caught up with MAGA and all this kind of
[1:09:35] stuff.
[1:09:39] And and and and if you don't have the
[1:09:41] Holy Ghost, you will be deceived.
[1:09:44] You will be deceived. Exactly. Right.
[1:09:46] And you will take the mark of the beast.
[1:09:49] Amen.
[1:09:52] And brother Brandham said also in the
[1:09:53] restoration of the brery any prophecy
[1:09:56] don't that don't stay with the word.
[1:09:58] That's exactly that's the reason I say
[1:10:00] today no matter how good it looks, how
[1:10:03] many preachers are saying this that or
[1:10:06] the other communism is going to take the
[1:10:09] world and throw it down. Don't you never
[1:10:11] try to fight communism. He says, "Fight
[1:10:14] Romanism."
[1:10:16] For that's thus sayith the Lord. The
[1:10:18] Lord said Romanism is going to rule, not
[1:10:21] communism. Communism is just a puppet.
[1:10:24] That's right, brother. And when Biden
[1:10:27] was the president, supposedly the
[1:10:29] president, that's what they would say.
[1:10:30] He's just a puppet up there.
[1:10:33] Look at Look at He's a fool. They were
[1:10:35] putting him that way, making him look
[1:10:37] that way to fool you. Y
[1:10:41] but you see he had to do that. The Lord
[1:10:43] told Micah, "I've got to send Ahab out
[1:10:46] there." He have them preachers to say
[1:10:48] that to send Ahab. And then he continued
[1:10:50] saying, "God had to let communism raise
[1:10:52] up." What do they do? They run all these
[1:10:55] here morgs together and made a
[1:10:57] confederation of churches to join up to
[1:10:59] make an image to the beast. Just what
[1:11:02] his word said would take place. Don't
[1:11:04] you worry about that. You watch the
[1:11:06] thing is forming under. Amen. And we
[1:11:09] know that the pope, this new pope,
[1:11:10] that's the speech he gave on May 14th, I
[1:11:13] believe it was. Let's all come back
[1:11:16] together to let's get together. Let's
[1:11:18] let's for for for the common good. You
[1:11:21] notice these little catchphrases they
[1:11:23] use. They always say the common good for
[1:11:25] the uh you know th those types of
[1:11:27] things. Those are catchphrases that they
[1:11:29] use and they tie that into climate
[1:11:32] change. They tie all that to you watch
[1:11:35] when this boycott comes in that brother
[1:11:37] Brandham talks about. It's all going to
[1:11:38] be tied into climate change. It's all
[1:11:40] going to be tied tied to all that kind
[1:11:42] of stuff. So you just be just be
[1:11:45] careful. I whatever you believe about
[1:11:46] climate change, you know, it's up to
[1:11:49] you. But they use it a
[1:11:51] lot as an agenda. The invasion of the
[1:11:55] United States, Brother Brandon says
[1:11:56] we're living in the shadows of the time.
[1:11:58] It could happen any time. When we see
[1:12:00] the times come for things to take place,
[1:12:03] the very wickedness of the enemy, the
[1:12:05] very powers, we look at these
[1:12:07] snowstorrms and everything happening,
[1:12:09] all these pestilence, all different
[1:12:11] things. That's that's all caused, look
[1:12:13] what brother Bram says, that's all
[1:12:15] caused by these
[1:12:16] interruptions of firing these bombs and
[1:12:19] things
[1:12:21] and then people make fun of you because
[1:12:23] you tell them that they can manipulate
[1:12:25] weather. Brother Brandham just said it
[1:12:26] right here. That's right. They're
[1:12:29] getting things all mixed up here and
[1:12:30] they're messing around in God's big
[1:12:32] laboratory to fulfill his word. It's
[1:12:36] going to
[1:12:38] happen. So, the man of sin rising up
[1:12:40] power so deceitful. My I heard a
[1:12:43] minister this morning, a spiritfilled
[1:12:44] man taking the mark of the beast and
[1:12:46] saying that the antichrist was Russia.
[1:12:48] What an error. Russia has nothing to do
[1:12:51] with it. No sir, that's scripturally
[1:12:52] now. But notice in this great time that
[1:12:55] we're living, a warning. Amen.
[1:12:58] And I have say here if you don't if you
[1:12:59] if if you if you don't know that they
[1:13:01] can manipulate weather just Google some
[1:13:03] of these things. Operation Papey Project
[1:13:06] Storm
[1:13:07] Fury and the Soviet Union's cloud
[1:13:10] seating Beijing weather modification in
[1:13:13] 2008 Olympics. Project Cirrus 1947. You
[1:13:16] can just look at that because some
[1:13:19] people look at you cross-sider when you
[1:13:20] tell them they can control the weather.
[1:13:22] Yeah, they can control the weather.
[1:13:28] The six sole purpose of Gabriel's visit
[1:13:30] to Daniel. Brother Brandon says, "Now
[1:13:31] what is another thing that would be
[1:13:33] known?" Look at today at the churches.
[1:13:34] Here it is. I hope it don't hurt, but I
[1:13:36] got to tell it making in that day there
[1:13:39] will be an antichrist rise. Now remember
[1:13:42] when we get into seals, that antichrist
[1:13:44] rides right out over those seals. Daniel
[1:13:46] spoke of it here. The prince that would
[1:13:48] come, he would be cut off. Jesus would
[1:13:50] to make reconciliations for the people.
[1:13:53] But that prince that would stand up that
[1:13:54] would cause the abomination to make
[1:13:56] desolation, that was Rome through Titus.
[1:13:59] And this time it's a prince coming out
[1:14:01] of Rome that'll do it. It's not Muslims
[1:14:03] either.
[1:14:05] Amen.
[1:14:07] It's Romanism.
[1:14:10] And he re he revealed in the last days.
[1:14:12] Muslims was another tool for them to to
[1:14:15] to to to perform their agendas to have a
[1:14:18] boogeyman to scare you to do to so that
[1:14:20] you can be subservient and
[1:14:23] obedient and then shall that wicked one
[1:14:25] be revealed when just at the time the
[1:14:28] Holy Ghost is being taken out which is
[1:14:29] fixing to leave right now. Brother Brown
[1:14:32] said what's he leaving for? Taking the
[1:14:34] church with him.
[1:14:37] Amen. Praise God.
[1:14:41] Let me just go quickly
[1:14:43] here. Yeah, I'm not This is your prophet
[1:14:47] speaking. He opposes himself above all
[1:14:50] that's called God. All the godly man.
[1:14:52] He's the holiest of all them. Sits in
[1:14:53] the temple of God. Just showing himself
[1:14:55] he is God. Forgiven sins on earth and so
[1:14:57] forth, you know. Sure. And he's talking
[1:14:59] about, you know, 666 and all that. I
[1:15:01] just wanted to read here just a quick
[1:15:02] some quick quotes of some things that
[1:15:05] they that that that the Catholic Church
[1:15:07] has has said that's just listen we we we
[1:15:10] do not fight flesh and blood but against
[1:15:13] powers and spirits. All right. I I I
[1:15:17] will sit down. I've been inside a
[1:15:18] Catholic church. I I'll go in there. I I
[1:15:21] I've talked to Catholics. I I I I'll
[1:15:23] fellowship with them. I know what it's
[1:15:26] like. I was one of them. You see? But
[1:15:28] they're not they're them themselves.
[1:15:30] They're just under a spell, under a
[1:15:32] system. You thought they need they need
[1:15:34] God. Amen. But see, some of these
[1:15:37] people, these popes and these higherups,
[1:15:39] they know what they're doing.
[1:15:41] All right. This is a quote. The pope and
[1:15:43] God are the
[1:15:45] same. So, he has all power in heaven and
[1:15:47] earth. This was Pope Pas I
[1:15:51] uh and it gives the reference there and
[1:15:53] quoted in Barlay chapter whatever cities
[1:15:56] of Petrus Bartinius. The foundation of
[1:15:59] all our com here's another quote. The
[1:16:00] foundation of all our confidence is
[1:16:02] found in the blessed virgin Mary. God
[1:16:04] has committed to her the treasury of all
[1:16:06] good things in order that everyone may
[1:16:08] know that through her are obtained every
[1:16:11] hope, every grace and all salvation for
[1:16:14] this is his will that we obtain
[1:16:16] everything through Mary. Pope Pas the uh
[1:16:20] 9th I believe that is and he said Pope
[1:16:23] Leo I 13th said this in 1890 but the
[1:16:27] supreme teacher in the church is the
[1:16:28] Roman
[1:16:29] pontiff. Union of minds therefore
[1:16:32] requires together with a perfect accord
[1:16:34] in the one faith complete submission and
[1:16:36] obedience of will to the church and to
[1:16:38] the Roman pontiff as to God himself.
[1:16:41] Those are the blasphemy. And that's the
[1:16:43] reason why why why the Bible says that
[1:16:46] it was a woman riding upon a beast with
[1:16:49] names of blasphemy over her head. She
[1:16:52] was blaspheing God and blaspheing the
[1:16:55] saints in heaven. Amen.
[1:16:58] The pope is of so great dignity and so
[1:17:01] exalted that he is not a mere man but as
[1:17:03] if it were God and the viker of God or
[1:17:07] the instead of
[1:17:08] God. All names which is which in the
[1:17:11] scriptures are applied to Christ by
[1:17:13] virtue of which it is established that
[1:17:15] he is over the church. All the same
[1:17:17] names are applied to the
[1:17:19] pope. That's why it's so
[1:17:21] important that that that that they uh
[1:17:25] that this is in your face now. It's
[1:17:27] becoming more in your face. That's
[1:17:29] right. Another quote that the Roman
[1:17:30] church never erred or made a mistake nor
[1:17:33] will it according to the scriptures ever
[1:17:35] er this was Gregory IIIth and
[1:17:38] 1076 in in
[1:17:40] 1958 Pope John the 23rd I believe that
[1:17:44] is he said this the savior himself is
[1:17:47] the door of the sheepfold I am the door
[1:17:50] of the sheep into this fold of Jesus no
[1:17:53] man may enter unless he be led by the
[1:17:55] sovereign
[1:17:57] pontiff and Only if they be united to
[1:17:59] him can man be saved. For the Roman
[1:18:03] pontiff or the pope is the viker of
[1:18:06] Christ and his personal representative
[1:18:09] on
[1:18:11] earth. Uh all names which in the
[1:18:14] scriptures are applied to Christ by
[1:18:16] virtue of which is it is established
[1:18:18] that he is over the church. All the same
[1:18:19] names are applied to the pope. That was
[1:18:22] that was in 1628. Uh I got I got the
[1:18:25] references here. And uh all right. And
[1:18:28] God himself is obliged to abide by the
[1:18:31] judgment of his priests and neither not
[1:18:32] to pardon nor to pardon according as
[1:18:34] they refuse to give absolution provided
[1:18:36] the penitent. There's one here
[1:18:39] that one here that I thought oh yes
[1:18:42] right this one right here. The pope
[1:18:44] takes the place of Jesus Christ on earth
[1:18:47] by divine right. The pope has supreme
[1:18:49] and full power in faith in morals over
[1:18:52] each and every pastor and his flock.
[1:18:56] That's exactly what they want. He is the
[1:18:59] true Viker, the head of the entire
[1:19:02] church, the father and teacher of all
[1:19:05] Christians. He is the infallible ruler,
[1:19:08] the founder of dogmas, the author of and
[1:19:10] the judge of councelss, the universal
[1:19:12] ruler of truth, the arbiter of the
[1:19:15] world, the supreme judge of heaven and
[1:19:16] the earth, the judge of all, being
[1:19:18] judged by no one but God himself on
[1:19:21] earth. This was quoted in the New York
[1:19:23] Catechism. All right. So, we'll just
[1:19:26] leave it at that.
[1:19:29] So, they know what they're doing and
[1:19:31] they know what
[1:19:39] um Okay, give me just a few minutes.
[1:19:44] Okay. In a super sign, Brother Bram says
[1:19:46] this. And you people, I've got to say
[1:19:48] this. Don't you never let anybody poke
[1:19:50] something down your back about
[1:19:51] communism. Communism is nothing. And
[1:19:53] it's just a tool in God's hands. I want
[1:19:56] any Bible reader, any prophet to stand
[1:19:58] to show me where the Bible ever says
[1:19:59] that communism will rule. It isn't
[1:20:01] communism that's going to rule. It's
[1:20:02] Romanism that's going to rule according
[1:20:05] to the Bible. Let me say this in
[1:20:06] closing. There's three great curtains
[1:20:08] today. One of them is the iron curtain.
[1:20:10] The other one is the bamboo curtain. And
[1:20:12] the other one is the purple curtain. You
[1:20:14] watch that one. That's the one that's
[1:20:15] going to rule. Amen. And then he says
[1:20:18] here that unless there comes a falling
[1:20:20] away, the man of sin can't reveal
[1:20:21] himself. All right. Um, then there's
[1:20:25] there's uh there's a line of people that
[1:20:27] that believe that that Jews were the
[1:20:29] they're the antichrist. And so, Brother
[1:20:32] Brandham says that these people who
[1:20:33] think that the Jews are the Antichrist,
[1:20:35] they are certainly a million miles off
[1:20:37] the line. Don't you never think the Jews
[1:20:39] are an antichrist? Their eyes were
[1:20:42] blinded purposely that he might have a
[1:20:44] way to get in. Giving us a time of
[1:20:48] repentance. Take advantage of that time.
[1:20:51] Amen. But watch what brother Brown says
[1:20:53] here. But the antichrist is a gentile.
[1:20:55] Amen. Certainly it is an impersonator of
[1:20:58] the truth. Anti- against. Now this great
[1:21:03] superman. Oh, how he become a great man.
[1:21:06] And then finally was thrown. Then after
[1:21:08] thrown he was crowned. All right.
[1:21:10] Questions and answer on the seal. They
[1:21:12] asked brother Brandham does the first
[1:21:13] horse rider first seal fulfill second
[1:21:15] Thessalonians which we read our opening
[1:21:17] scripture. The revelation of the man of
[1:21:19] sin. He says, "Yes, that's right. That
[1:21:21] does. That's the man of sin."
[1:21:24] Of course, the man of sin can rule
[1:21:26] inside of you. You can become your own
[1:21:27] pope if you're if you don't abide by the
[1:21:30] word of God.
[1:21:32] Amen. That that that that's where I'm
[1:21:34] trying I'm trying to get to. This same
[1:21:36] man just keeps in stages riding on until
[1:21:39] he gets on a pale horse was called
[1:21:41] death. Amen. All right. And there's Let
[1:21:45] me just skip down here. There's one
[1:21:47] right here.
[1:21:58] Okay. Oh, the God of this evil age. Oh
[1:22:01] peoples of the United States, where this
[1:22:03] message is going now, flee. This is in
[1:22:06] 1965. Flee as hard as you can from this
[1:22:11] knowledge, scientific age.
[1:22:15] Why do you think they're pushing so much
[1:22:16] Elon Musk and and all this scientific
[1:22:20] stuff and all
[1:22:22] this? It's heading all to the mark of
[1:22:25] the beast. It's exactly what it's
[1:22:27] heading to.
[1:22:34] Um scientific age that we're living in,
[1:22:36] flee to the word of God. No one can
[1:22:39] knows it. And he says, "And in the last
[1:22:41] days, the God of this evil age would
[1:22:43] blind the eyes of the people with his
[1:22:44] intellectual
[1:22:46] knowledge and a mixed tree of good and
[1:22:49] evil." Remember, the tree is good, but
[1:22:51] it's also evil. Still giving it to the
[1:22:54] people. And here it comes. That thing
[1:22:56] heading up, that denomination from way
[1:22:58] back in the dark ages. Speaking about
[1:23:01] the ro Roman Catholic Church and before
[1:23:03] the dark ages, all heading up in a
[1:23:06] Superman.
[1:23:08] Amen. That's what the people wanted and
[1:23:10] that's what they got. They got him
[1:23:12] sitting up there in the White House, a
[1:23:14] Superman. And they also have a
[1:23:15] technological Superman as well named
[1:23:17] Elon Musk and a Jeff Bezos and all all
[1:23:20] these supermen. That's and that's what
[1:23:22] will blind the people. Amen.
[1:23:25] Who before the dark ages I will exalt
[1:23:28] myself above the sons of God and they'll
[1:23:31] listen to me and he as God will sit in
[1:23:33] the temple of God and the sons of God
[1:23:35] will fall for it. that the sons of God
[1:23:38] will fall for it. I predict that the two
[1:23:41] denominational groups Pentecostal and
[1:23:43] the evangelical groups will work
[1:23:44] together in a
[1:23:46] denomination will unite themselves
[1:23:48] together and will become a member all of
[1:23:50] them of the federation of the council of
[1:23:52] churches or the council of churches
[1:23:53] which they got now. They already belong
[1:23:56] to it. All of them. And there will come
[1:23:58] through them a for a forcing or a
[1:24:01] boycott that will stop everything but
[1:24:04] what belongs to that union of
[1:24:07] churches. Don't be surprised that one
[1:24:09] day your bank account won't won't won't
[1:24:12] work anymore and you can't log in.
[1:24:16] I don't know how it's going to all
[1:24:18] happen, but you don't go by their rules.
[1:24:20] You're not going to get access.
[1:24:26] I'm just saying that as as an example.
[1:24:28] They could be multiple things, you know,
[1:24:31] and they're they're working on all those
[1:24:33] things
[1:24:35] because they want to have control over
[1:24:36] the people. That's what the Bible say.
[1:24:38] See, see, back then in the dark ages, it
[1:24:41] was a a you do not believe the Catholic
[1:24:44] Church. You do not you're going to
[1:24:46] prison or you're going to get you're
[1:24:48] going to get your head chopped off or
[1:24:50] burned into a steak. Now, it's a it's
[1:24:52] it's a it's a it's not it's not a it's
[1:24:55] not that way anymore. Now, it's it's in
[1:24:57] a digital way that they're going to come
[1:24:59] against you.
[1:25:01] And that's why they they're the whole
[1:25:02] time they've just been bamboozling you
[1:25:04] with with with technology and
[1:25:07] smartwatches and all that kind of stuff
[1:25:10] so that you can just easily accept in
[1:25:12] and transition over into what they're
[1:25:14] going to give you. Right. And you might
[1:25:17] think I'm a crazy and I'm an idiot, but
[1:25:20] that's exactly where he's going.
[1:25:24] The Bible, that's what the Bible said
[1:25:26] that there would be a boycott even to
[1:25:28] such a way would cause people to not buy
[1:25:30] or sell unless they had received this
[1:25:32] the mark of the beast which is Romanism
[1:25:35] and the image of the beast which is
[1:25:36] Protestantism that the image the beast
[1:25:39] had power authority to give the image
[1:25:41] life to speak and it did. And that's the
[1:25:43] confederation of churches when they
[1:25:44] confederate themselves together. Now
[1:25:47] there's many young people here. Brother
[1:25:49] Brandon says I don't know Jesus may come
[1:25:50] this afternoon. He may come next year. I
[1:25:52] don't know when he'll be coming. But if
[1:25:55] remember if I do not live to see that
[1:25:56] day is coming, which I hope that I will
[1:25:58] and somehow believe I will. Now if I do
[1:26:00] not see it, do not let this word ever
[1:26:02] depart from your ears and your heart.
[1:26:04] See, just remember I speak in the name
[1:26:06] of the Lord. Amen. All right. All right.
[1:26:09] And so we read about the son of
[1:26:10] predition. Amen. It's very interesting
[1:26:12] that Revelation 17 speaks about this the
[1:26:15] the the the
[1:26:18] the church there of
[1:26:21] predition and uh you can read that. I'll
[1:26:24] just but it's very interesting. Read
[1:26:26] read 17. Here's your homework. Read
[1:26:28] Revelation 17. Okay. And then watch
[1:26:32] where it says the predition, the son of
[1:26:34] predition, which means destruction. And
[1:26:36] it's very interesting that it's the it's
[1:26:38] the Greek word. It's the uh the Greek
[1:26:42] word
[1:26:44] uh forgot
[1:26:47] what forgot what the Greek word was but
[1:26:50] anyways is this exact same Greek word
[1:26:52] that Jesus said in John 17 where he was
[1:26:56] praying for us and it says that I've
[1:26:58] I've given them this and they've
[1:27:01] believed me except for the son of
[1:27:03] predition is the exact same thing. It's
[1:27:06] very interesting it's the same chapter
[1:27:08] too.
[1:27:10] So, I'm so glad that there is a people,
[1:27:12] amen, that is getting ready to leave
[1:27:14] this world. Amen. That as the Holy Ghost
[1:27:17] is getting ready to leave, we're leaving
[1:27:18] with it. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord
[1:27:21] Jesus. And so, uh, do your research. You
[1:27:26] go yourself, search it out. I just
[1:27:28] wanted to read those quotes to you
[1:27:30] because sometimes I know we all don't
[1:27:32] get to to read the quotes ourselves and
[1:27:34] and uh there's plenty of others. Uh, I
[1:27:37] have a list there, but I can't. Time is
[1:27:40] escaping me. All right, really quick.
[1:27:43] Now, after I made y'all feel so
[1:27:47] bad, y'all forgive me. That's not my
[1:27:50] intention. I just needed to say what I
[1:27:53] needed to say.
[1:27:55] And I wasn't saying anything contrary to
[1:27:57] the word. I don't think I was. I was I
[1:27:59] was saying exactly what brother Brandon
[1:28:01] was saying.
[1:28:05] Now, if it scares you, then maybe that's
[1:28:07] what you need in order to get to get to
[1:28:10] the to get to the altar. Amen. Amen. I
[1:28:14] don't want to scare you. And I don't
[1:28:15] want you to come and repent because a
[1:28:16] pope came in or or or or or cuz I scared
[1:28:19] you. No, no, no. I want you to be
[1:28:20] convinced. Amen. And then concerned.
[1:28:24] Convinced that it's the truth. Amen.
[1:28:27] Praise God. Amen. We uh as you all know,
[1:28:30] we went to uh uh uh Honduras a couple of
[1:28:34] weeks ago and uh just wanted to share
[1:28:36] some pictures here uh really
[1:28:40] quick cuz uh I haven't been here in a
[1:28:43] while. So, I'm just I'm taking my
[1:28:47] time. All right. I don't if the brothers
[1:28:50] could bring that back then. I had some
[1:28:52] pictures here and I don't know where
[1:28:53] they went now.
[1:28:59] There we go. All right. So, uh, Brother
[1:29:04] Aaron, you know who the who these people
[1:29:05] are? That's Brother Beckan. And, uh,
[1:29:08] Brother Aaron preached there. And so, we
[1:29:09] were there that first night and preached
[1:29:11] for Brother Beckham. He's the brother on
[1:29:13] the far right next to the sister. That's
[1:29:15] his wife. This in the brother in the
[1:29:17] middle is brother Eric, Eric Gao's dad,
[1:29:21] brother uh, Giovanni. So we were we were
[1:29:25] there that first night preaching for
[1:29:27] them. Um then we went there for a youth
[1:29:30] camp and they had a youth camp. It was
[1:29:33] one of
[1:29:34] the bigger uh it was it was a good
[1:29:37] turnout and that we heard we heard
[1:29:39] several people say that it was one of
[1:29:41] the best youth camps that they've had so
[1:29:43] far. And so we trust that that they will
[1:29:47] continue to get better. Amen. Brother
[1:29:50] Eric did some wonderful things this time
[1:29:52] around with the young people and
[1:29:54] introducing some ideas and some things
[1:29:56] to get the young people involved. Amen.
[1:29:59] Um so uh it was it was really wonderful.
[1:30:02] One of the things that they did was was
[1:30:05] uh they they they were they were
[1:30:07] introducing uh or talking about you know
[1:30:10] um I forgot that
[1:30:13] theme after salvation then what because
[1:30:16] you know how brother Brandham said he
[1:30:17] you know the best thing that he could
[1:30:19] give a man uh outside of his salvation
[1:30:22] is a good wife right and so he they were
[1:30:25] taking those things and they were they
[1:30:27] took several couples who were been
[1:30:29] married for several years we were the
[1:30:32] ones that my wife and I we've been
[1:30:34] married almost 20 years now. And so we
[1:30:37] got to they got to see that uh you know
[1:30:39] and got to
[1:30:40] hear that they were just as human and
[1:30:43] and just as uh relatable, you know, to
[1:30:46] them. They were given their test like
[1:30:48] their testimony. They asked them
[1:30:49] questions. How did you meet your first
[1:30:51] wife? And the young people were
[1:30:52] listening, you know, how did you or how
[1:30:54] did you meet your wife? Not your first
[1:30:55] wife. I'm sorry.
[1:30:57] [Laughter]
[1:31:01] Uh they were that was their first wife
[1:31:03] as far as I know all of them there.
[1:31:05] Brother Paco was one of them in there
[1:31:07] and everything. And he he just made it
[1:31:09] he made it very funny and and so they
[1:31:11] were it was very relatable to to to
[1:31:14] them, you know, how they were just just
[1:31:17] like them when they were younger, you
[1:31:18] know, and they met just like, you know,
[1:31:20] some of them said, "I met I met them.
[1:31:22] What what what caused you to what was so
[1:31:24] attractive to them when you first met
[1:31:26] them?" And some of them have their
[1:31:28] different things of what was attractive
[1:31:29] to them. And um but you know they were
[1:31:32] just young young people at the time but
[1:31:34] then how God has led them now to where
[1:31:36] they are now. And so it was really
[1:31:38] really good. And so I ministered uh the
[1:31:41] two morning services and uh brother Eric
[1:31:44] asked me to minister the morning
[1:31:46] services. Uh took a series a little
[1:31:49] series on Samson uh because the theme
[1:31:52] was uh uh the preeminence in Christ. All
[1:31:55] right. And so took some some things with
[1:31:58] regarding Samson and and kind of did
[1:32:00] more of a teaching type thing. We had
[1:32:02] brother Solomon Huffman there and
[1:32:04] brother Brad Y was there as well. And so
[1:32:07] here's the first evening service,
[1:32:09] brother Solomon and me interpreting for
[1:32:11] brother Solomon. This was the last
[1:32:13] sermon uh service. I was interpreting
[1:32:16] for brother Solomon. And of course my
[1:32:18] voice was shot by the end of the thing.
[1:32:20] And we had to we just had to keep going.
[1:32:23] That's me ministering the I believe that
[1:32:25] was the first morning service that we
[1:32:28] had there. Uh some more young people
[1:32:30] came in. This is little Ol. Look how big
[1:32:33] he is
[1:32:35] now. There's Zoe right there next to
[1:32:37] him. So he's all right. These are all
[1:32:40] the little the the places the little
[1:32:42] mattresses where the young people sleep
[1:32:44] after the camp was done. The me the
[1:32:46] meetings were done. We had to take a
[1:32:48] bunch of them put them up in a truck.
[1:32:50] that truck did multiple multiple because
[1:32:53] they reuse them again. They reuse them
[1:32:54] throughout the ministers when they have
[1:32:56] the ministers meetings and also
[1:32:58] throughout the different youth camps.
[1:33:00] They reuse these these these these
[1:33:02] things. Um so we were helped. Um I
[1:33:06] thought this little picture was this was
[1:33:08] Zoe couple of years ago in Nicaragua
[1:33:11] sweeping and then here she was a couple
[1:33:14] years later doing the same thing. So we
[1:33:15] we just kind of thought it was a Zoe.
[1:33:19] [Laughter]
[1:33:23] And there was young several young
[1:33:25] people. We had a pray uh last night the
[1:33:28] last night uh uh that uh there um
[1:33:31] brother Brad Jans preached and uh he
[1:33:33] suggested that we have a prayer line.
[1:33:35] Now they they don't do prayer lines and
[1:33:38] but they we had a prayer line and uh and
[1:33:42] it was very interesting because almost
[1:33:45] everybody came up for prayer. They went
[1:33:48] through the prayer line and uh there was
[1:33:50] people that that that young people that
[1:33:52] uh I I'll tell you this there was a
[1:33:54] brother not at the prayer line but this
[1:33:56] was uh one of the other nights a brother
[1:33:58] came up asking for prayer for his for
[1:34:01] his daughter and when his and he was
[1:34:03] crying and we were praying for him. He's
[1:34:06] saying my daughter she she needs the
[1:34:08] Lord. She needs she needs to to to to
[1:34:11] you know she needs the Holy Ghost. She
[1:34:13] needs and he was crying and you could
[1:34:15] tell he was just so sincere. He was so
[1:34:17] sincere. We were praying for him and his
[1:34:19] daughter was in the congregation. And
[1:34:21] then next thing you know, his daughter
[1:34:23] was standing right there, right there.
[1:34:24] She came in and they they hugged and
[1:34:26] they cried and then we prayed for both
[1:34:28] of them and uh she came up. Nobody told
[1:34:31] her, nobody was pushing or anything. She
[1:34:33] came up by herself. Amen. And uh it was
[1:34:36] such a beautiful thing. So uh there was
[1:34:38] a sister that wanted to get baptized and
[1:34:40] so they baptized her. I I I I uh just a
[1:34:47] a
[1:34:48] quick video of of
[1:34:56] that. Yeah. Yeah. I won't won't play the
[1:34:59] whole thing,
[1:35:01] but that's brother Solomon. He baptized
[1:35:06] her. All
[1:35:08] right. So, sister wanted to get
[1:35:11] baptized. So we made sure we facilitated
[1:35:13] that. Amen. Um and
[1:35:20] uh
[1:35:24] Okay. All right. And then this was uh
[1:35:27] some of the sisters that that were
[1:35:28] helping the cooks and all that. I took
[1:35:30] this picture because uh after we had
[1:35:31] cleaned up, it took several hours to
[1:35:33] clean up everything, the camp,
[1:35:35] everything. This is what they were
[1:35:37] laying in that grass. And I know I saw
[1:35:40] dogs doing mess on that grass. I saw but
[1:35:44] they didn't care. They were
[1:35:47] tired. All right. And then there's some
[1:35:49] of the some of the people from the And
[1:35:52] there's sister Christine. She's help uh
[1:35:55] there uh them with a a song special that
[1:35:59] uh that uh that that we sung that was
[1:36:02] kind of turned out to be kind of like a
[1:36:04] theme song for the for the camp. And it
[1:36:07] was to God be the to no
[1:36:10] I gloria and uh and uh the people were
[1:36:14] blessed by that. So it was a wonderful
[1:36:16] song. So and then uh here's a some of
[1:36:23] the little kids singing. Um and Zoe was
[1:36:27] back there playing the piano for
[1:36:30] them.
[1:36:33] Uh, and they were singing a a a very big
[1:36:37] God. Uh, I think we've sang we've sang
[1:36:41] that
[1:36:43] here.
[1:36:45] Okay. And then here's a video of
[1:36:50] the of one of the evening services
[1:36:56] uh during a song service.
[1:37:04] So,
[1:37:06] okay. All
[1:37:08] right. Thank God. Thank you for your
[1:37:11] prayers. Mission accomplished there.
[1:37:15] And uh we just appreciate the Lord
[1:37:17] giving us the opportunity to serve him
[1:37:19] and to serve his people. Amen. Amen.
[1:37:22] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:37:31] Saints, if you want to get upset at
[1:37:33] somebody, get upset at the devil.
[1:37:35] Don't get upset at me.
[1:37:38] Don't get upset at at at the at anybody
[1:37:41] that comes behind the pulpit and tells
[1:37:42] you truth.
[1:37:44] You know, you look, you search it out
[1:37:46] yourself. Look at yourself. Compare it
[1:37:49] to history. compare it to the times of
[1:37:52] our day and and and see if it if it
[1:37:55] agrees, if it lines up. Cuz some of us
[1:37:57] sometimes we're just kind of scared to
[1:37:59] talk about these things. But I'm not
[1:38:00] scared. I'm just I've just uh I've had
[1:38:04] enough of of just trying to hide what I
[1:38:06] believe. I'm I'm just going to say it
[1:38:08] the way and then that that's it. Like
[1:38:10] fall the chips fall where they may. But
[1:38:12] I believe we're living in a late hour
[1:38:14] because Satan is going on one extreme.
[1:38:16] We got to go tell to the the other
[1:38:18] extreme. So, um, let's just stand to our
[1:38:22] feet
[1:38:26] cuz one day you are going to have to
[1:38:29] you're going to have to fight for the
[1:38:31] faith. You you're going to you believe,
[1:38:34] oh no, that that can't happen. That was
[1:38:36] just back then. Oh, it's heading that
[1:38:37] way now. It's exactly heading this way.
[1:38:42] And you can be in your happy joy joy.
[1:38:44] That that that's okay. Hey, and we we're
[1:38:46] joying Christ. But be on be know where
[1:38:49] you're standing. Know what you believe.
[1:38:52] Know it for yourself. Cuz these people
[1:38:54] are very astute. Yes. They know what
[1:38:57] they they know the word. The Satan knows
[1:39:00] the word. These people come with you
[1:39:01] with the word. And you
[1:39:04] yourself, you have so much word that I
[1:39:08] don't need anymore of God.
[1:39:11] But it's not down here. It's only up
[1:39:13] here. Amen. And that's what that's what
[1:39:15] in that you become a pope to yourself.
[1:39:18] And so take that amen to consideration.
[1:39:21] Let's just bow our heads. Lord Jesus, we
[1:39:24] pray heavenly father that you would just
[1:39:27] Lord take these things father a little
[1:39:29] bit chopped up Lord notes here and there
[1:39:31] different things. But Father God you you
[1:39:34] can put everything together Lord and and
[1:39:36] Lord I don't I didn't I don't mean to to
[1:39:39] scare the people. That's not my
[1:39:41] intention. I don't I don't want to do
[1:39:42] that. Maybe maybe I I did, but but
[1:39:46] Father God, I that that wasn't my
[1:39:48] intention, Lord. I I just pray, Lord,
[1:39:50] that you would just take these things
[1:39:51] and and that people I I I just want them
[1:39:54] to be more serious about the hour that
[1:39:56] we're living in, Lord. And and Father
[1:39:59] God, that that things aren't going to be
[1:40:01] this way forever. And Lord Jesus, you
[1:40:05] told us to watch. And Father, that's
[1:40:08] what we're doing. We're watching, Lord.
[1:40:11] And so, Father God, your word has to be
[1:40:13] fulfilled. And I pray, Lord God, that
[1:40:15] you would just help us to take these
[1:40:17] things into consideration seriously. And
[1:40:21] Lord, know that the hour that we're
[1:40:23] living in is very late. Let me, heavenly
[1:40:26] father, do what I'm supposed to do,
[1:40:28] Lord. Let me repent. Lord, let me,
[1:40:31] Father God, we were filled with the Holy
[1:40:33] Ghost, Lord Jesus, because I need more
[1:40:36] of you just as much as anybody else
[1:40:38] does, Lord. And I pray heavenly father
[1:40:41] that you would just grant that Lord for
[1:40:43] each one of us Lord Jesus. Father God
[1:40:46] may you bless your people now Lord. Keep
[1:40:48] them father on the roads until we meet
[1:40:50] again Lord Jesus. Father God may we
[1:40:52] leave this place but never your
[1:40:54] presence. We ask these things now in
[1:40:56] Jesus Christ's name.
[1:40:58] Amen. Amen. Let's sing one verse of this
[1:41:01] and then upon the
[1:41:04] Lord shall
[1:41:06] renew their
[1:41:09] strength. They lift a mountain up with
[1:41:15] wings as an
[1:41:19] eagle. They shall run and not be weary.
[1:41:26] They
[1:41:27] shall and our
[1:41:30] kings. Teach me Lord.
[1:41:33] Teach me
[1:41:35] Lord new
[1:41:38] [Music]
[1:41:40] ways and teach
[1:41:44] me
[1:41:45] [Music]
[1:41:48] way my
[1:41:51] knees till in
[1:41:54] your good
[1:41:56] time you
[1:41:59] answer my plea.
[1:42:02] Teach me
[1:42:04] not to
[1:42:06] rely on what
[1:42:10] others
[1:42:12] do, but to
[1:42:14] wait in
[1:42:17] prayer for an
[1:42:20] answer from you.
[1:42:23] They that
[1:42:24] wait upon the
[1:42:27] Lord shall
[1:42:30] renew their
[1:42:32] strength. They shall mount up with
[1:42:38] wings as an
[1:42:43] eagle. They shall run and not be weary.
[1:42:49] They shall walk and not
[1:42:53] faint. Teach me
[1:42:56] Lord, teach me
[1:42:59] Lord to
[1:43:02] wait. Oh, and they that
[1:43:06] wait upon the
[1:43:09] Lord shall
[1:43:11] renew their strength.
[1:43:15] They shall mount up with
[1:43:19] wings as an
[1:43:24] eagle. They shall run and not be weary.
[1:43:30] For they shall
[1:43:32] walk in
[1:43:34] faith. Teach me
[1:43:37] Lord. Teach me
[1:43:39] Lord to win.
[1:43:44] Praise the Lord
[1:43:46] Jesus. Hearts. Amen.
[1:43:53] [Music]
[1:43:55] Oh, they that
[1:43:57] wait upon the
[1:43:59] Lord shall
[1:44:02] renew their strength.
[1:44:05] They shall mount up with
[1:44:09] wings as an
[1:44:14] eagle. They shall run and not be
[1:44:19] weary. They shall walk and not
[1:44:24] faint. Teach me,
[1:44:27] Lord. Teach me
[1:44:30] Lord to your dismiss this afternoon.
