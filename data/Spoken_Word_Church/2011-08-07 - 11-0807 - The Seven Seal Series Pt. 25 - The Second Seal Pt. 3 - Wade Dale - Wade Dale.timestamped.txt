[0:00] that's life but this is more than life
[0:04] my brother Brian said about assurance
[0:06] that the insurance agent told him said
[0:08] well if you don't have insurance that
[0:10] won't get you in the in the graveyard
[0:13] for brother Roundtable but if I have
[0:14] usherence it'll get me out not worried
[0:17] about getting in I'm worried about
[0:18] getting out all right
[0:21] after this life is over we don't have to
[0:23] worry about it if we make our
[0:25] preparation right here
[0:28] maybe this is the wake up call for all
[0:31] of us
[0:32] to be a little more sober and a little
[0:34] more humble a little more
[0:38] aware
[0:40] that life is fragile that's right very
[0:43] frightening
[0:45] and you never know what's in the mind of
[0:47] a person that's right that's exactly
[0:49] right
[0:52] we have to do with it and go on that's
[0:53] you know what we're talking about now
[0:55] about the uh
[0:57] the Dark Ages
[0:59] those people died by the Millions and
[1:02] they just kept right on going brother
[1:03] Brown said it was at Ox spirit that us
[1:07] that labor that sacrificial they just
[1:10] give their life for the gospel that was
[1:11] just part of the age and part of the
[1:13] thing and you know what it's given to us
[1:15] in this age to do the same thing be a
[1:17] sacrifice be sacrificial
[1:20] not so much literally now but with our
[1:22] time and you know support that we
[1:25] support each other uh we're still human
[1:28] we have feelings we need to let them out
[1:33] talk to somebody
[1:35] life friends with people I mean even
[1:37] though you're a born-again Believer look
[1:39] at all these people that was in this
[1:40] fourth age they were born again
[1:42] Christian yet they died by the millions
[1:45] daily they were dying in hundreds
[1:49] but what did they do I don't think they
[1:51] sat around and said oh we better quit
[1:52] doing this we better not be let's go
[1:54] let's go you know no you don't want it
[1:56] done it's separated than Believers from
[1:59] the make believe and I promise you that
[2:00] because when you get ready to go in that
[2:01] lines then you know you're not coming
[2:03] out you better know that like I said
[2:05] about that Assurance the Assurance is
[2:07] going to get them out of the out of the
[2:09] Grave all right it doesn't matter about
[2:11] the insurance going in it's about the
[2:13] Assurance going out
[2:16] but let's read uh
[2:18] starting with the second seal now we we
[2:20] finished with the first seal
[2:22] get started with the second
[2:25] and I hope you all enjoyed another mom
[2:27] last week those of you that we're here
[2:29] yeah that would be the lesson on the
[2:30] internet we are going to get to hear him
[2:32] again next Sunday
[2:34] we're going to give him another chance
[2:36] to pass out
[2:41] he didn't finish his fault
[2:43] and I'm going to be in Oklahoma so I
[2:46] just pray for me I'm leaving Friday
[2:48] morning and I'll be back Monday but just
[2:50] remember Bob he uh
[2:54] trial by fire right bro tonight around
[2:57] my fire
[2:58] that somebody told me that he didn't get
[3:00] finished with all his notes and he said
[3:02] what am I going to do I only got a week
[3:03] I said
[3:04] just read the notes that you didn't read
[3:06] last Sunday
[3:08] that's a preacher's secrets
[3:11] you don't use a lot of notes you Circle
[3:13] them and you use them in the next
[3:14] service all right he said it was good
[3:17] because he made him study I said now he
[3:18] knows what we have to go do we have to
[3:20] study you know
[3:22] that's why that's why we're and we're
[3:24] serving this yeah you take brother they
[3:27] don't have them to get three services a
[3:28] week retired or not retired I used to do
[3:32] it when he wasn't retired he used to get
[3:34] three services every week now you don't
[3:37] just sit down in your study and lean
[3:39] back in your chair and God forged it in
[3:42] the Bible says study to show yourself
[3:45] approved not I'll pour it in he said
[3:48] I'll pour out the windows of Heaven he'd
[3:49] be inside I was gonna pour it in your
[3:50] brain
[3:52] so so you pray for these people that
[3:54] labor
[3:56] the laborers the five-fold ministry you
[3:58] pray for them and you know me being a
[4:00] part of you we all need prayer right you
[4:03] need to practice and I need to pray
[4:05] all right chapter six of Revelation
[4:08] more as the day approaches the Bible
[4:09] says we need to bind together right
[4:12] let's don't separate people bind
[4:15] together that's right the more we bind
[4:17] together
[4:18] the more what does what does Satan want
[4:21] to do he wants to divide and conquer
[4:22] that's what he did right here he divided
[4:25] the people and he conquered them
[4:28] by what by giving them a false Doctrine
[4:31] took peace and killed by story we'll
[4:33] talk about the doctrine all right let's
[4:35] go to verse three and when he had opened
[4:39] the second seal
[4:40] I heard the second beast say come and
[4:42] see
[4:43] and there went out another horse that
[4:45] was red
[4:46] lost another horse but it's the same
[4:49] person riding on that horse all right
[4:52] same devil
[4:54] riding on the horse
[4:56] but the horse now is red
[4:58] instead of white white he got him
[5:01] remember we talked about white he
[5:03] deceived them with white
[5:05] but now this red you can't deceive with
[5:08] red so he's raised up a little bit
[5:09] higher in that red horse is going to be
[5:14] brother Brandon said blood that's what
[5:17] we'll we'll point to this in just a
[5:18] second let's finish there without
[5:20] another horse that was red and power was
[5:22] given there's that other power was given
[5:26] brother Arthur Satan has no powers
[5:29] in chapter six if you'll underline every
[5:32] time the word given is used you'll see
[5:34] that God gave him permitted power Satan
[5:37] has zero power unless you give it to him
[5:41] okay unless you get like we said if he
[5:43] had a bowl with no arrows we bundle up a
[5:46] big box of arrows every day and we hand
[5:49] it to Satan and say here shoot me that's
[5:51] right
[5:52] we give him the errands right the
[5:55] straightest the best
[5:59] the sharpest
[6:01] why don't we give God our bath
[6:04] take the short of the word that's all of
[6:07] it that's it me include I'm I'm part of
[6:09] this whole thing all right
[6:12] power was given to him that sat there on
[6:15] to take peace from the Earth
[6:17] and that they should kill one another
[6:20] not just him doing the killing now he
[6:22] has moved up
[6:24] listen pay attention to this kill one
[6:26] another
[6:27] so it's not just Satan doing the killing
[6:29] he has now instilled his Doctrine into
[6:33] somebody else and now somebody else is
[6:35] doing the killing yeah Satan's a coward
[6:40] he heard me say that Zayn's account
[6:43] you know why because you get somebody
[6:46] else to do his Dirty Work you get
[6:48] somebody else to do his dirty work okay
[6:50] you understand that so he's a coward
[6:53] he has no power so he gets the power
[6:55] from you that's right divide and conquer
[6:58] he brings you in right he says hey why
[7:00] don't you do this
[7:02] and then what did they do kill one
[7:04] another brother Brown says kill the
[7:06] influence of a man you've killed the man
[7:08] so who how do you kill an influence of a
[7:10] man oh did you know you see that brother
[7:12] that boy he
[7:14] killed his influence because I start
[7:16] with this brother this brother starts
[7:18] with this brother this brother tell this
[7:19] brother this brother we can't keep our
[7:20] mouths yet
[7:21] James said the tongue's the hardest
[7:23] thing to tame so
[7:25] smallest muscle and the hardest one to
[7:27] tame so
[7:29] but you know what if we cut it off
[7:31] they're like them resistance
[7:34] it'll sure help
[7:37] to resist the devil he'll flee from you
[7:39] power was given to him that sat in their
[7:41] own to take peace from the earth and
[7:43] that they should kill one another let me
[7:46] emphasize again now it's not just Satan
[7:48] riding in a white righteous church he
[7:50] has now took that white righteous Church
[7:52] to another level and he's using that
[7:54] white righteous Church to do what
[7:57] go out and do his dirty work now
[8:01] remember one thing that is in opposition
[8:03] to that real white righteous church that
[8:07] went out that was led by God led by the
[8:10] Holy Spirit God does the same thing
[8:12] actually Satan is copying of God right
[8:15] because God's doing the same thing God's
[8:17] wanting to work through you he God's not
[8:19] God don't want all the glory he's going
[8:20] to get all the glory because he's God
[8:23] but he wants you to work through you
[8:26] okay he wants to work through human
[8:28] being so see Satan wants to do the same
[8:31] thing
[8:32] so you got copycats say this copycat but
[8:35] God wants to reveal God wants to give
[8:38] you peace everything that's that's on
[8:41] here is vice versa is what God wants to
[8:42] do Satan wants to take away peace God
[8:44] wants to give peace all right right here
[8:46] remember I said Peace I give unto thee
[8:49] what the piece of knowing that you got
[8:51] God in your heart right all right to
[8:54] take peace from the earth and they
[8:55] should kill one another and there was
[8:57] given unto him a great sword
[8:59] what was it a great sword not just a
[9:02] sword a great sword it's a Doctrine
[9:04] right
[9:06] remember it started with a
[9:08] saying
[9:10] among the people
[9:12] Deeds of the Nicolaitans and 606 now
[9:15] it's become a Doctrine
[9:16] so what does the doctrine do Doctrine I
[9:19] tell this one the doctrine that one goes
[9:21] and tells that doctor to somebody else
[9:23] see what happened Satan got in that in
[9:26] the church the real Church Satan got in
[9:28] a real Church
[9:29] the brother Adam said the real bride
[9:30] went to nicaea
[9:32] to try to stop this
[9:35] and brother Ryan said they got trapped
[9:37] in itself what happened they were we
[9:39] Christians
[9:41] not fully mature Christians not not the
[9:43] palms and the peters and and the ones
[9:45] that if they would have went to nice if
[9:47] they'd had to put them in jail they had
[9:49] to throw the place up
[9:51] but a lot of weak Christians went there
[9:54] and they got caught in the Trap all
[9:56] right
[9:58] divide and conquer Keel all right
[10:02] because remember the first deal we
[10:04] looked at was justification that was
[10:08] the Seal of God in a white righteous
[10:11] Church
[10:13] Satan's then it was God in a white
[10:15] righteous Church the real righteous
[10:18] church and if you're righteous the Bible
[10:20] says you're just as righteous as God is
[10:22] so you're just you're Justified
[10:25] Justified means you didn't do it in the
[10:27] first place all right so
[10:31] now we're at the second seal which is
[10:34] red blood
[10:36] which is sanctification I want you to
[10:39] remember that keep that we'll go back to
[10:41] all these we're going to come back to
[10:43] them later but right now we're getting
[10:45] the symbols we're getting what happened
[10:47] we're putting the ages together with
[10:49] them and then when we come back we're
[10:50] going to see justification
[10:52] sanctifications of baptism the Holy
[10:53] Ghost and then the pure word of God
[10:55] which is that your first sale second
[10:57] sale third sale for sale all right
[10:59] second seal which is red red signifies
[11:04] what blood
[11:05] and blood the blood of Jesus Christ does
[11:08] what cleanses and sanctifies that's the
[11:11] only thing that's sanctifies remember
[11:13] brother Ryan said the world you can
[11:15] think these seals and time right into
[11:16] the world
[11:17] because the world was justified under
[11:19] Noah
[11:20] there was a judge group of people
[11:22] under Noah's age no one and his family
[11:24] were saying all right
[11:27] that's God washing the Earth off
[11:29] justifying it then he Sanctified it by
[11:31] what Jesus Christ coming and brother
[11:33] Ryan said he shed his blood his blood
[11:35] drops on the earth to cleanse and claim
[11:38] everybody that's why I want you to
[11:40] understand that this this glorified body
[11:42] thing that brother Dale's preaching
[11:44] about it is is a lot deeper than what
[11:46] we're catching I believe
[11:48] because when he's when that blood
[11:50] dripped on the Earth
[11:52] your body your natural moral the one I'm
[11:55] looking at now your body was in the
[11:56] earth
[11:57] he cleansed
[12:00] do you hear what I said he cleansed
[12:03] and claimed it that's right at Calvary
[12:06] right your body now your soul was
[12:10] redeemed before the foundation of the
[12:11] world because your name was put in the
[12:12] lounge Book of Life and I'll let you
[12:13] understand that
[12:15] but when you come down in human flesh
[12:18] your body was already
[12:23] her name
[12:25] I'm sorry
[12:28] Mama eating out of the syrup that's
[12:31] correct mother ate beans and potatoes
[12:34] and the beans and potatoes went and got
[12:36] down in the soil of the earth and pulled
[12:38] all those nutrients up nutrients were in
[12:40] the beans mama ate the beans daddy eat
[12:42] the beans blood cells were produced and
[12:44] what is
[12:46] um
[12:46] we're all adults everybody's sperm and
[12:49] and it's highly congealed blood it's
[12:52] it's DNA uh same thing with the female
[12:55] with the egg what is it it's 16 elements
[12:57] so your body was physically not just
[13:00] this is not something that just well
[13:02] listen to a good thought I think a lot
[13:04] of us would just say well this is just a
[13:06] good thought well praise the Lord my
[13:07] body was in the earth no your literal
[13:09] body you're standing in right now within
[13:10] the Earth that's right that's right
[13:12] as elements
[13:15] and when Jesus died and that blood
[13:18] dripped on the earth it cleansed and
[13:20] claimed the body you're in right now if
[13:23] you're born again that's right
[13:25] if you're not born again then you just
[13:27] got a downward pull and you're just here
[13:29] root Beast made for Destruction sorry
[13:31] that's just the way it goes that's right
[13:34] um
[13:34] and I want to make mention if somebody
[13:36] hears this but I've had some people make
[13:39] comments about what we're saying down
[13:41] here
[13:42] I want you to understand one thing
[13:45] there's a difference in being justified
[13:47] Sanctified and filled with the Holy
[13:49] Ghost
[13:51] and die and Libya or live your life out
[13:54] as a good Christian and pass on and then
[13:56] come up in the resurrection that's one
[13:59] I think the comment was made that I was
[14:01] pretty strong on on smoking and drinking
[14:04] and stuff like that and you know
[14:05] somebody come to me and said well you
[14:07] know what about the man that drank the
[14:10] beer he was a Christian but he drank
[14:12] beer but what happened to him
[14:14] God shortened his life
[14:19] I want y'all to understand one thing
[14:21] that's not what we're talking about down
[14:22] here
[14:23] you smoke and drink
[14:26] and defile your body right now you're
[14:29] not going to take a change we're talking
[14:31] about a change this is talking about
[14:32] changing the body right
[14:34] and I don't I don't know how to separate
[14:36] this I've been wanting to preach on this
[14:38] but it'll hurt feelings
[14:40] there's Christians that's going to be
[14:43] good Christians and have eternal life
[14:45] and they're going to die and go by the
[14:46] Grave gonna have to people now it's not
[14:49] a
[14:50] it's not a something we bypass
[14:54] but when we're talking about these seals
[14:56] we're talking about the purest form and
[14:58] you say Well it you're talking about
[15:00] works
[15:01] faith without worse and then Works
[15:03] without faith by my words I'll show you
[15:06] my faith that's right
[15:07] what faith for now what a body change
[15:09] see brother Arthur
[15:12] um job had a
[15:14] he had a saying he said in my flesh I
[15:16] shall see God that's what he said right
[15:18] in my flesh right here in my flesh but
[15:22] now in the end time
[15:24] without dying
[15:26] in my flesh I shall see God without
[15:29] dying somebody's gonna make that change
[15:32] and smoke is not going to be a part of
[15:35] it drinking's not gonna be I did not say
[15:37] that I don't be christianized somebody
[15:38] what I'm saying is down here when we're
[15:40] talking about this we're talking about
[15:42] the fullness we're talking about going
[15:44] to the change of my body you might be a
[15:47] Christian I don't see how but you might
[15:49] be a Christian and smoke and still I
[15:50] don't see how you can do that because
[15:53] God won't go on an unclean vessel but
[15:55] now you can get trapped
[15:57] just like the just like the preacher did
[15:59] you can get trapped all of us can get
[16:01] trapped we're humans that's right
[16:03] adulteries and stuff like that that's
[16:05] not going to knock you out of heaven but
[16:07] now you keep on doing that right you
[16:10] never had it to start with right
[16:12] but brother Brown said Satan has one
[16:14] shot
[16:16] wherever you're the weakest you better
[16:18] cover it because he's got he's due one
[16:21] shot because see he's a squatter for
[16:23] this thing right here I know Jesus
[16:25] Christ cleansed and claimed it but
[16:27] remember Gone In the Garden of Eden he
[16:30] cursed the Earth and he cursed Adam
[16:32] didn't curse he cursed the Earth so the
[16:35] Earth has a curse on it and Satan now
[16:37] has a hold on that because that's all he
[16:38] uses the curse that's right Satan is
[16:41] cursed so he's got to hold on this human
[16:43] body
[16:45] a little tie to it that's right but I
[16:48] was reading last night in in Rising of
[16:50] the sun need to read that over and over
[16:52] again
[16:54] with the new birth though you have an
[16:56] abstract title deed that clears
[16:57] everything back
[17:00] everything
[17:02] see but now we're not talking about
[17:04] greasy grains we're not talking about
[17:05] where you can go out and do whatever you
[17:06] want to do no you can't do that
[17:08] but you can slip and fall you can do
[17:11] things wrong you can you know if you had
[17:14] a problem with with alcohol and and you
[17:18] know you like that preacher did but I
[17:19] promise you one thing you're not going
[17:21] to make a body change that's what I want
[17:22] you to understand when I say that you're
[17:24] dying and going to hell I don't mean
[17:26] you're dying and going to hell just
[17:28] because you smoke
[17:30] but if you're a Christian you won't do
[17:32] it but if you do get caught and do do it
[17:34] you'll either quit real quick or God's
[17:36] going to cut your life shorts you wonder
[17:38] why these people's lives are being cut
[17:39] short God's not gonna put up with junk
[17:41] right right
[17:43] that's all of us any of us God's number
[17:45] put up with John that's true
[17:56] that's right
[17:58] that's the word here that's right keep a
[18:01] balance I want y'all to listen to me
[18:04] and I'll leave it listen on the internet
[18:06] listen to me
[18:08] you have got to separate these two
[18:12] things that we're talking about
[18:13] and everybody understand that this means
[18:16] yes and this means no right yeah
[18:21] I see some loud amens and I see some
[18:23] really good
[18:26] but you can be a Christian and have
[18:29] problems that's right but when we're
[18:31] talking about this right here what we're
[18:32] talking about in this Sunday school
[18:34] class about the seals that is the the
[18:37] the Apex of anything that's ever been on
[18:40] the earth because you know what Jesus
[18:42] Christ even had to give he gave his life
[18:44] right for you and I right but he was
[18:47] without sin
[18:48] he took on your sin amen so that you can
[18:52] be sinless okay so let's go back to the
[18:55] seal now that we got off of that sorry
[18:56] but
[18:57] I want to clarify that because I don't
[18:59] want people to have a question say well
[19:00] you say you're condemning uh you know
[19:03] and I'm sure the person's gonna hear
[19:04] this but
[19:05] uh they said well I'm glad you're not
[19:07] going to be my judge well let me tell
[19:10] you one thing God put me in this place
[19:11] right here
[19:13] my words are going to condemn you
[19:15] whether you like it or not
[19:17] exactly if it's from God now if it's not
[19:20] if it's just way down and getting in the
[19:22] flesh then then it's just me getting in
[19:24] the flesh forgive me but if it's God
[19:26] speaking to you and it's the truth and
[19:28] it comes out of this word yeah what I
[19:30] say will judge you right you know you
[19:32] say well I'm glad you're not my judge
[19:35] you come to church and listen
[19:38] I'm not your judge
[19:40] but the word that comes out is the judge
[19:43] and if I tell you the truth that's right
[19:46] then I'm just a mouthpiece just like
[19:48] this this thing I got right here amen
[19:51] you know I'm just this right here God's
[19:53] speaking to you through that that's
[19:54] right and I hope that that's what you
[19:57] know you sometimes we do get in the
[19:59] flesh sometimes we do have our own
[20:00] comments and our own ideas but when
[20:02] we're talking about this these seals
[20:04] we're talking about a specific group of
[20:06] people not just all Christians
[20:09] and I don't need christianized people
[20:11] that didn't you know brother Ryan didn't
[20:13] say about that old preacher everybody
[20:15] don't remember the story and do I need
[20:17] to tell the story
[20:18] remember that there was a minister
[20:21] brother Brown said a child of God right
[20:23] childhood of God said a child of God
[20:27] y'all gotta remember one thing look what
[20:29] Adam did right amen he was a Son of God
[20:32] he come straight from God didn't have to
[20:34] be born he wasn't born with sin and look
[20:37] what he done
[20:38] look at all those people through the Old
[20:40] Testament we know they didn't have the
[20:41] new birth but look at all the people in
[20:43] Utah a lot of things happened a lot of
[20:45] things went on you got to be careful but
[20:47] this minister
[20:48] brother Brown said he came to a point
[20:50] that he said I'm done
[20:52] I'm finished I'm not preaching anymore
[20:54] he said the devil got a hold of his mind
[20:56] and that's where he plays right here in
[20:58] your mind got a hold of his mind
[21:00] and he told them everybody told the
[21:02] black guy said hey Moe's gonna buy me a
[21:04] a six-pack I'm just I'm done with it he
[21:07] throwed it toward his part up throw it
[21:09] in the trash
[21:10] mode had enough sense he said I'm not
[21:13] going to get you none so he went got it
[21:14] himself and started drinking and brother
[21:16] random said shortly thereafter he died
[21:18] like a month he died he said God took
[21:22] that servant see so he was identifying
[21:24] God took that servant home that's right
[21:26] so he was a Christian he went to heaven
[21:28] God if God took somebody home it's not
[21:31] the hell right if God took his servant
[21:33] home it's to Heaven said God took his
[21:36] servant home so he wasn't Mario's name
[21:38] now I'm not talking about Martin the
[21:40] man's name he wasn't marked my name
[21:44] because you can't do that you can't you
[21:45] can't see me down at the brothel ever
[21:47] Saturday night and didn't see me you
[21:49] know here on Sunday and something had
[21:51] something got happened
[21:53] okay so we got to be careful
[21:56] about what we do careful about our life
[21:58] and I apologize for some of the things
[22:01] that I say that may be too strong but
[22:03] it's the truth if you smoke drink and
[22:06] cursing do the things you used to do and
[22:07] you're still doing them now you're not
[22:09] born again period amen if you're sitting
[22:12] right here if you've been listening this
[22:13] long in this church and you're still
[22:14] doing it you're not born again best
[22:15] thing to do go to the altar all right
[22:17] you're committing adultery you're doing
[22:19] the thing you need to go the office
[22:20] you're not
[22:21] even part of this that's right
[22:24] and I'm not trying to separate what
[22:26] we're talking about last night remember
[22:27] brother Ryan was talking about going
[22:29] through segregation
[22:30] this is the segregationalist part not
[22:32] black and white right right but sin and
[22:36] righteousness that's right cannot come
[22:39] together they have to be separated
[22:41] that's right so I don't want you to I
[22:43] want you to understand one thing I'm not
[22:44] de-christianizing people I'm just
[22:45] telling you what the word says
[22:47] we can fall we can stumble but brother
[22:51] Brian said the true Mark of a Christian
[22:52] is to get back up that's right and go
[22:55] quit what you're doing get up and take
[22:57] off and say God don't ever let me do
[22:58] that again all right and and you know
[23:02] what
[23:03] you think well that's too simple let's
[23:05] don't get into Catholicism where we
[23:06] think we got to beat ourselves by with a
[23:08] whip or go on a 40-day faster or drag or
[23:12] you know do like Luther thought he could
[23:13] you know he could lay out on a rock you
[23:15] know and and let somebody beat him and
[23:17] you can't beat it out of you I promise
[23:19] you that right God's got to take it out
[23:21] of it and you ask God you know I was
[23:23] thinking this morning brother Brandon
[23:25] said if you got a problem with x
[23:29] do the vice versa
[23:33] that's profound
[23:35] but yet simple
[23:37] if you're stingy
[23:40] give money away
[23:42] right
[23:43] that's what he said did he not say that
[23:45] dude the vice versa
[23:47] all right just do the vice versa and
[23:52] he didn't give scripture for that
[23:56] you gave five scriptures for doing the
[23:59] vice versa but there's one scripture
[24:01] says flee the devil or resist the devil
[24:04] and he'll flee from them
[24:06] powerful scripture yes but but remember
[24:09] when we're talking about these seals
[24:10] when I'm talking about the the change in
[24:13] the body
[24:14] you're not going to have those kind of
[24:16] problems now we're going to have human
[24:17] life problems
[24:20] don't think we're gonna be superhuman
[24:21] that's right
[24:22] well we are Supernatural That's right
[24:25] like we talked about last night we are
[24:26] Supernatural group of people even even a
[24:30] sinner is Supernatural right A Sinner's
[24:33] Supernatural The Sinner dies where does
[24:36] his body go and you don't have to open
[24:37] the door for it to get out that's right
[24:39] so it's supernatural it's not natural
[24:40] natural is the body can go out the door
[24:43] did you separate the body and the soul
[24:46] my soul just goes down it's in another
[24:48] dimension so it's supernatural like they
[24:51] said it's supernatural don't get that
[24:52] mixed up with eternal
[24:56] there's terrestrial and celestial bodies
[24:58] terrestrial down here Celestial is is
[25:00] where you got what you got here
[25:03] it's kind of interesting how your body
[25:05] works and then all of a sudden when you
[25:07] take whatever's inside of you out it
[25:09] quits working
[25:11] I mean what's making all this you ever
[25:12] thought about you ever sat down and
[25:14] thought about it
[25:15] if you ever sit down and thought that
[25:17] that how your body is one whole unit
[25:20] but if you start separating those units
[25:23] yeah something happened yeah that's
[25:24] right
[25:25] so the body is really just like this
[25:28] microphone
[25:30] it only does what the inside tells it to
[25:33] do
[25:35] listen unless you have a a muscle
[25:37] problem
[25:39] my hand won't just automatically do this
[25:41] I gotta make it to it
[25:44] you know automatically it just hangs
[25:46] like this
[25:48] but I'll make it do what I want it to do
[25:51] you know I was thinking
[25:53] um the medical professional
[26:00] s
[26:01] so that's where the greatest battle is
[26:03] sure in your mind
[26:07] the greatest battle is not in your flesh
[26:09] I promise you that your flesh only does
[26:12] what you're inside tell them to do right
[26:15] so don't say my flesh made me do it
[26:17] right no the devil inside you made you
[26:20] do it and your flesh just
[26:23] responding and just responds it's just
[26:25] like a it's just like a covering you
[26:28] just pull over a covering that's all
[26:29] this is it's just like a rubber covering
[26:31] but it's made out of Flash so I don't
[26:33] know how the world we got into this but
[26:34] maybe we needed it today but in the
[26:37] second seagull let's remember one thing
[26:38] before we before we get done
[26:41] um let's look at our symbol gotta tell
[26:42] him you want to put it on
[26:45] a swing of samples get the symbols and
[26:46] then Brothers uh Bob will be
[26:49] with you next weekend and then Mom are
[26:52] y'all going to
[26:54] Mama are y'all going to Johnson Richard
[26:57] nope
[26:59] no but the next
[27:02] basically the one Wednesday or Sunday
[27:04] anyway if I have to preach Sunday then
[27:06] somebody else can do that brother you
[27:07] all need to get one ready whoever turn
[27:09] it is
[27:10] okay all right second seal
[27:14] power was given to him who the devil
[27:17] all right it was a what a great story
[27:19] which was brother Brown said it was a
[27:21] Doctrine so all right the symbols was to
[27:24] take peace and to kill that's naturally
[27:27] and spiritually because remember during
[27:29] this time of this fourth Church age in
[27:31] the dark at ages 68 million Christians
[27:34] were put to death
[27:36] all right
[27:38] the red horse is a symbol of blood
[27:40] the combat Beast is the Ops which we
[27:42] were just talking about the sacrificial
[27:44] part uh that were a burden barrier that
[27:47] labored this was the longest Church age
[27:49] it went from like 606 A.D to 1500 it was
[27:52] one of the long it was the longest
[27:54] turkey
[27:56] but God was with these people just as
[27:58] much as he's with us now all right they
[28:00] just didn't have the depth of the word
[28:02] there their their their whole point was
[28:06] I believe in Jesus Christ
[28:08] he died for my sins
[28:10] and now I give my life for the gospel
[28:12] see that was the life that they left
[28:15] okay but we have to be a little bit I
[28:18] don't like to say different but maybe a
[28:20] little bit um
[28:21] and I don't like to say better or higher
[28:23] up but but more word has come to us than
[28:26] than they had the word they have well
[28:28] the word Luther had was the just shall
[28:30] live by faith
[28:32] he didn't care about sanctification he
[28:34] could drink a beer and smoke a pot
[28:37] and it didn't bother him
[28:40] but see that was God for the time
[28:42] he believed come out of that Catholic
[28:44] church and said that just
[28:46] shall live by faith not by what the
[28:48] Catholic Church says or Not by pennants
[28:50] or by novenas or but live by faith what
[28:53] faith in the word of God he didn't just
[28:55] read that one scripture and die and only
[28:57] priests out of the Bible that he could
[28:59] show there that the Justified people
[29:01] live by faith the Bible was being
[29:04] written in Martin Luther's time so he
[29:05] had the Bible he had this Bible that
[29:07] we're looking at now he had the word of
[29:09] God
[29:10] so he had a little more understanding
[29:12] because these people in this Dark Age
[29:14] didn't have a Bible
[29:17] they'd have a Bible sure they might have
[29:19] had some appalls or writings or
[29:20] something or Peter but they didn't have
[29:22] a compound Bible until right there at
[29:25] the end in 1500 A.D they started putting
[29:27] the Bible together maybe somewhere in
[29:29] the latter part but most of these people
[29:31] only had
[29:32] think about it think about this
[29:36] they went to church underground most of
[29:39] the time
[29:39] they didn't have a great big Sanctuary
[29:41] for the air conditioning and a great big
[29:42] sign that told us who told him who he
[29:44] was and all they met in houses and and
[29:47] underneath houses and stuff like that
[29:49] they were hiding because it meant give
[29:52] your you're going to give your life but
[29:54] they didn't have a Bible
[29:57] they didn't have a quote book that's
[29:59] right
[30:00] they had what that preacher told them
[30:03] only
[30:05] sure they might have the Old Testament
[30:07] the Torah and some of those things but
[30:08] what I'm talking about they didn't come
[30:10] to church
[30:11] with any kind of book
[30:14] the income church with a book in their
[30:16] hand with a quote book
[30:18] well Paul said well they might have had
[30:20] but you know what they've done they
[30:22] believed
[30:23] in those pastors and teachers and
[30:25] evangelists they had them back then
[30:28] no this is not just for the end time
[30:30] this this was this started in Peterstown
[30:33] all right so they had those people and
[30:36] and but you know what the difference was
[30:38] they had the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost
[30:40] told them whether that man was talking
[30:42] the truth or not
[30:44] in any road or down s paper sure I'm
[30:47] sure people maybe took notes but think
[30:48] about coming to church now and no no
[30:50] computer
[30:52] none of broke around the book all you
[30:55] had was
[30:56] what the preacher told you
[30:59] we're getting back to it
[31:01] we're going to get back to it you're
[31:03] going to get back to where you're going
[31:04] to be the quote you're going to be the
[31:06] living Bible
[31:07] you're not gonna have to carry around a
[31:09] computer not heaven for sure but when we
[31:12] get closer to the end time we ever get
[31:13] separated again it's going to be almost
[31:15] like this right here right you're going
[31:17] to have what you've got in here right
[31:19] it's got to come here first but it's got
[31:22] to drop down here right right all right
[31:25] so Church age for the fourth Age The
[31:27] Wicked one was physically killed the
[31:29] people and spiritually killed more than
[31:32] was physically killed brother Reynolds
[31:34] said 68 million were physically killed
[31:36] and he's an Untold billion were killed
[31:39] by the doctrine not just of the Catholic
[31:41] church we think Catholic church but
[31:43] brother round does call that the
[31:45] Catholic age okay which was the age that
[31:48] the Catholics put all these people who
[31:50] do you think put these people to death
[31:52] we went to robbers and the thieves and
[31:54] the whoremongers it was the Christian
[31:56] so-called
[31:57] so-called Christian
[31:59] what was he doing he was riding
[32:02] a red horse
[32:04] getting his power from the people
[32:07] saying it's better to kill them
[32:11] than to let them go on the way they are
[32:13] better to kill them
[32:20] and bring your steelbook make sure you
[32:21] bring the steel books don't we
[32:24] come together
