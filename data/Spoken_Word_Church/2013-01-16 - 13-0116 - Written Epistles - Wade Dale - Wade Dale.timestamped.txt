[12:10] in the path of sin and
[12:13] they might be
[12:14] there's somebody looking out for amen
[12:18] I love that quote where brother Branham
[12:21] said what I'm sorry yes sir hope
[12:24] realizes who to ride with him yes
[12:26] Hallelujah
[12:29] one thing I love about brother Brown
[12:30] said one time he said you know what he
[12:32] said some old grandma a long time ago
[12:36] got on her knees and touched God right
[12:40] and he said save my children my
[12:42] grandchild and my great grandchildren
[12:43] amen you know what we'll be able to
[12:46] thank that person because you'll be able
[12:49] to know that over there you'll be
[12:50] connected with how you got here and you
[12:53] will absolutely see that God had his
[12:56] hand in everything that we do right
[12:58] where do we we're serving him at the
[13:01] moment or not he was right there with us
[13:04] because he said he'll never leave us our
[13:05] forsaken Gloria so if you got your
[13:07] Bibles let's turn to the book of second
[13:09] Corinthians just from
[13:12] real
[13:13] kind of a short thought tonight but
[13:16] something that's been bearing on my
[13:17] heart and we're
[13:19] we're starting in the Sunday school
[13:20] class on a study on Christianity

[13:34] gonna be more people in heaven that
[13:35] don't know brother Brown then do oh my
[13:37] there's going to be born again
[13:38] Christians now I'm not be christianizing
[13:40] him at all or saying that we don't need
[13:41] him I'm just telling you if we don't
[13:43] live a christ-like life
[13:45] forget about what William Brown said
[13:46] right amen just be plain all right
[13:49] second Corinthians 3
[13:52] verse 1. let's bow our head before we
[13:56] get started Heavenly Father we thank you

[14:07] that there's a God
[14:08] that healed all of our diseases Even in
[14:10] our stupidity the things that we do
[14:13] wrong in life you're there with us Lord
[14:15] you said you'd never leave us you'd
[14:17] never forsake us and I depend on that
[14:19] whether I can feel you or whether I can
[14:21] see you or whether I know you're even
[14:23] there father I have to believe that
[14:25] you're there with him and I pray that
[14:27] each one tonight will will feel that
[14:29] that you are there with them and and
[14:32] truly be satisfied that they come to the
[14:35] house of the Lord to hear from you Lord
[14:36] and not from a man and not from a person
[14:38] but from the person the man Christ Jesus
[14:42] good Lord you're the one that went to
[14:44] the cross and died for our sins you're
[14:46] the one that took all of our shame and
[14:48] took all of our stripes and took all of
[14:51] our worries and Lord if we just lay them

[16:33] Second Corinthians 3 verse 1.
[16:35] Dewey began again to commend ourselves
[16:40] or need we as some other Epistles of
[16:43] commendation to you are letters of
[16:45] accommodation from you
[16:47] you are our epistle now that word
[16:49] epistle means what letter
[16:51] you are our letter written in our hearts
[16:54] not our own piece of paper
[16:56] known and read of all men that doesn't
[16:59] say just all saints that Center in Saint
[17:02] all right for as much as you are
[17:04] manifestly declared to be
[17:08] that's my manifestation
[17:10] manifestly declared to be the Epistle of
[17:12] Christ ministered by US Written not
[17:14] within
[17:16] but with the spirit of the Living God
[17:17] not in tables of stone but in flexially
[17:19] tables of the heart
[17:22] and such trust we through Christ to
[17:24] godward not that we are sufficient of
[17:27] ourselves
[17:29] that's our problem right we think we got
[17:32] something to do with it
[17:34] okay we not that we are sufficient of
[17:38] ourselves do you think anything as of
[17:41] ourselves but our sufficiency is of God
[17:44] Amen who also hath made us able
[17:46] Ministers of the New Testament not of
[17:48] the letter but of the spirit for the
[17:51] letter killeth
[17:52] but the spirit giveth life you may be
[17:55] seated in the Lord and his Blessing to
[17:57] the reading of the word
[17:59] I don't know brother Jason Jackson call
[18:01] me today and or sent me a taxes and
[18:04] asked me was I preaching to a piece list
[18:05] and then I got it down now in my
[18:08] computer so I'm okay I can handle it
[18:11] they've been trying to get me to bring
[18:13] my computer up here and do it on do the
[18:15] uh sermon on a computer like the big
[18:18] name Preachers did but I'm not a big
[18:19] name preacher so I'll just leave mine on
[18:21] paper and I still believe in bringing
[18:23] the old book up here too
[18:26] now I still believe in that book I I uh
[18:29] they saw me at work today in the last
[18:31] few days that Mom and Dad gave me this
[18:33] book in 1998 and
[18:35] right it's about wore out so I'm
[18:38] transferring like Daddy used to do with
[18:39] his so I'm only in numbers no
[18:42] Deuteronomy so it's going to take
[18:45] probably about two or three months to
[18:46] get down to the end of the 66 books of
[18:49] the Bible of all the things that I've
[18:50] got written that I'm going to transfer
[18:52] over to my new Bible but I'm going to
[18:54] use the one that brother Jeff's tremel
[18:55] gave me in 2007 so I'm gonna switch over
[18:58] to that that Bible so but that Bible is
[19:02] uh it's precious to me I'll always keep
[19:04] it right now the in the Greek Lexicon
[19:06] we're going to see if you'll put him up
[19:08] Joe will brother Joe will start
[19:10] that the word if Strong's that epistle
[19:14] is a letter
[19:16] all right so Paul's saying ye are our
[19:18] letter
[19:20] written in our hearts now listen to the
[19:23] first quote brother Brown said hit the
[19:24] hidden life with Christ now we're gonna
[19:26] we're gonna probably not be very long
[19:28] but that's okay I'm gonna I'm gonna hit
[19:30] some points but I want you to realize
[19:32] that that Sunday school we're going to
[19:34] start it's it's Christianity and I don't
[19:37] want people to get the wrong impression
[19:39] especially out on the internet that that
[19:41] we believe in Christianity outside of
[19:43] the message of the hour but I believe
[19:44] that you can get born again right right
[19:47] Ram said you put an egg under a dog
[19:49] right and it'll hatch but once that
[19:51] thing hatches it knows it's an eagle
[19:52] it's going to go to Mama right
[19:54] right the dog's not the mama anymore
[19:56] it's going to go to Mama Eagle so I I
[19:58] believe that I believe that we have come
[20:01] to a place and and if if I walk up and
[20:04] down your toes and you just move them or
[20:06] leave them out there but I'm talking to
[20:09] every one of you everybody asks me a lot
[20:11] of times bro Martin didn't answer well
[20:13] what are you preaching on tonight I said
[20:14] you yeah
[20:16] who else you're preaching to right
[20:19] preaching to you so listen get in life
[20:22] with Christ Minneapolis Minnesota
[20:24] oh and the the theme downstairs in our
[20:26] Sunday school class is going to be
[20:27] leaving me a sermon
[20:29] yeah
[20:30] big man sir man right
[20:33] Don't Preach me one lend me one man and
[20:35] that's where all we're all fail but you
[20:37] know what we got to get to that right
[20:39] God didn't put you here to work in a
[20:41] factory just alone he puts you here as a
[20:43] testimony a written epistle right of all
[20:45] men to live an honorable and decent life
[20:48] and a hid consecrated life with God so
[20:51] that men would know that Jesus Christ
[20:53] still lives and Reigns amen amen that's
[20:55] a little Pinchy but it's good now look
[20:58] up that word Pinchy you won't find it
[21:00] but the prophet used is good enough for
[21:02] me it'll help your digesting order
[21:05] orders you know to take the food right
[21:07] amen it'll fit you into a place where
[21:10] that you can receive healing for both
[21:12] soul and body amen now see I've been
[21:16] doing it now I I don't use yellow
[21:18] highlighter and I like that blue so it
[21:20] kind of brings it out a little bit but
[21:22] now look
[21:23] the god intend for the Bible to be
[21:25] written
[21:31] Adam did not need a guidebook right
[21:36] Adam didn't go looking for the Book of
[21:38] Genesis it wasn't written it actually
[21:41] wasn't written because Moses wrote it
[21:42] way over all right now what God want God
[21:46] wanted to live life right Adam was the
[21:49] example he was the example human
[21:53] he didn't need a reference guide to have
[21:55] the mind of Christ no when the Holy
[21:57] Ghost came and indwelled that man he had
[21:59] the mind of Christ
[22:01] now we know that he fell and we know
[22:03] that he fell from from continuing on to
[22:06] be the one to bring you and me and you
[22:09] into being but still
[22:11] he still had the mind of God he didn't
[22:14] lose that I don't believe at the time of
[22:16] the Fall I don't believe he went from a
[22:18] saying to a sinner
[22:21] and thought like a sinner after the fall
[22:23] no he continued to have the mind of
[22:26] Christ he just couldn't do any he
[22:28] couldn't get those Clues got stopped up
[22:31] the blues got stopped up and he couldn't
[22:33] operate because what happened enmity
[22:35] division right in his brain he couldn't
[22:38] do the things that he used to do because
[22:41] remember he was now afraid that's right
[22:43] that fear had not come upon him until
[22:45] the fall came and he didn't he didn't
[22:49] he didn't disobey his wife he disobeyed
[22:53] what God Said right all right and then
[22:56] of course he tried to pass the buck we
[22:57] know that but having the mind of Christ
[23:00] he could do things that you and I he
[23:04] lived a life
[23:06] that was exemplary he was uh he was the
[23:09] example son
[23:11] before the fall when he could say Let
[23:14] There Be move this here put this over
[23:17] here name all the animals now if we fell
[23:20] from that
[23:22] that's what we fell from the national
[23:25] position we got to go back to amen right
[23:28] not a lower position to where that can't
[23:31] happen no it's got to be the same
[23:32] position
[23:34] through the second Adam got to bring
[23:37] that back and restore it to Fellowship
[23:39] where you and I can talk to God faith to
[23:44] Faith amen that's right face to face
[23:47] right
[23:48] I don't even have a problem walking up
[23:50] to the Almighty
[23:53] said hey Daddy how are you today that's
[23:56] right brother Brown would say
[23:58] son how was it today
[24:00] oh Dad we walked through the garden and
[24:03] you know me and my wife we walked
[24:05] through the garden had a wonderful time
[24:06] we don't want that's what's going to
[24:08] happen to you and I right when we get
[24:10] all this sin curse out of the way and
[24:12] get all that stuff going but you know
[24:14] what I read them a quote in The
[24:16] Minister's meeting that brother Brown
[24:18] said God will become so visible Among Us
[24:20] right
[24:22] yeah that's right that he would raise
[24:23] the damn and going to Rapture amen amen
[24:27] become so visible among us alone
[24:31] that's it now we're not going to see the
[24:34] physical man like Adam did
[24:36] come on but where are we gonna see him
[24:39] come on each other
[24:43] then where are we that's right
[24:46] how far up the road are we
[24:52] blessing people in the in the New
[24:55] Testament just with the faith of the
[24:57] fathers
[24:58] just with the faith of the fathers you
[25:01] know
[25:02] man would walk by
[25:05] in the shadow of that man will heal from
[25:07] right amen
[25:09] that's right exactly the shadow of that
[25:12] man
[25:14] now that you don't have to get that out
[25:17] of a quote book all right you can't go
[25:19] try to find that somewhere
[25:21] Peter that Peter didn't say silver and
[25:24] gold have my number let me look in first
[25:25] Corinthians no because it wasn't written
[25:27] right or let me go look in the Old
[25:30] Testament
[25:31] I mean my word I was thinking today
[25:34] when when you went to that what was one
[25:37] I can't remember his name that was in
[25:38] the book of Acts that was preaching that
[25:40] Jesus was the Christ out of the Old
[25:41] Testament was it that's the Cornelius
[25:43] who was it
[25:46] I forgot his name but anyway remember he
[25:49] says have you Paul comes and have you a
[25:51] fever Holy Ghost since you believe Paul
[25:52] comes and tell him a Polish now look
[25:56] Apollos without the new birth right
[26:01] without the quickening of the word
[26:05] right
[26:06] to the degree of a holy ghost-filled
[26:07] person he did not have the Holy Ghost
[26:09] just in a Sanctified condition
[26:12] he was taking the Old Testament
[26:15] and proving that Jesus was God Amen
[26:20] right without the Holy Ghost
[26:23] exactly preach
[26:26] but then Paul comes along he says have
[26:28] you received the Holy Ghost since you
[26:30] believe this right
[26:33] and you know what they said we didn't
[26:36] know whether there be a holy ghost in
[26:37] other words they was preaching all this
[26:39] right they never heard of that right
[26:42] right come on brother
[26:48] blessing
[26:50] I know this is hard but it's gonna beat
[26:52] every one of us
[26:55] how are we gonna get up here
[26:58] when we don't have it down here right
[27:01] that's right the simple things right
[27:08] the Ten Commandments
[27:12] when Moses came on Earth
[27:14] Moses did not have the Ten Commandments
[27:17] he did not know one thing about the Ten
[27:20] Commandments right
[27:22] he delivered two million people
[27:26] two million people right
[27:29] out of the land of Egypt without the
[27:32] Sith
[27:33] the Lord in prayer yeah
[27:36] right amen he just walked up and said
[27:40] God said God said to me I'm telling you
[27:43] right and he did say that saith the Lord
[27:45] but it wasn't something written down
[27:46] that he could hand pharaoh and say look
[27:49] God told me to tell you this no he
[27:51] walked up there and even God told him
[27:54] said you be God that's right Aaron's
[27:58] going to be your Prophet I'm going to
[28:00] tell you and you tell Aaron right
[28:02] because if you're reading the Bible
[28:04] Moses is not the one that used the rod
[28:10] Moses told Aaron what to do and Aaron
[28:13] went and done it a type of what we're
[28:15] supposed to do we're supposed to believe
[28:16] our prophet and we're supposed to take
[28:18] what the prophet said take that staff
[28:20] and take it to the people or take it to
[28:21] the devil right but now watch
[28:25] those Ten Commandments
[28:28] you know anybody think of God
[28:36] 1964 614 we've quoted this many times
[28:41] before but I want you to see something
[28:42] here
[28:43] I'm just going to kind of take it a
[28:45] little slower
[28:46] I know they they accuse me of
[28:49] preaching too fast when I was in a
[28:51] Minister's meeting so I'm going to slow
[28:53] down a little bit
[29:01] remember before the true message came
[29:04] forth
[29:05] before the true message came forward
[29:07] right
[29:08] Moses preached and he led them out of
[29:11] Egypt
[29:12] but there before the real Commandments
[29:15] was laid down he said the sales was
[29:18] brought in
[29:19] so the sales are part of the Redemptive
[29:21] plan right the Ten Commandments all
[29:23] right but now they weren't written until
[29:26] God gave them to Moses all right God
[29:29] came down before the people and proved
[29:31] that Moses was sent from him that's
[29:33] right in a pillar of fire that Moses
[29:34] said he'd seen that bush he talked to
[29:37] him now look before that God did not
[29:40] want to give them the Ten Commandments
[29:42] on two sheets of right of stone
[29:47] he told Moses he said Moses because see
[29:50] he was in Horeb when he saw the burning
[29:52] bush
[29:53] backs out of the desert he was with
[29:56] um Jeff Roman and doing all that and
[29:58] then he went to Egypt and God said bring
[30:00] them back to this mountain and I will
[30:02] talk to them not write it down all right
[30:05] I will talk to them
[30:08] just like I'm talking to you Moses I
[30:10] will talk to them right right
[30:13] but now
[30:14] what happened when Moses went up there
[30:18] they said Moses you go we'll stay down
[30:22] here whatever God tells you that's what
[30:24] we'll do well they lied there
[30:26] oh yeah but that's what brother Brown
[30:29] said they didn't know what they got but
[30:31] they got God in letter form right
[30:34] called The Ten Commandments right all
[30:37] right which was
[30:40] their Redemption
[30:42] that was their Redemption right oh sure
[30:45] it was the bullets in The Oxen The
[30:47] Killing but that was all in that Ten
[30:48] Commandments Thou shalt not Thou shalt
[30:50] not look at all hey I've been going
[30:52] through
[30:53] um Genesis Exodus Leviticus and been
[30:55] around me the past three days pretty
[30:57] much reading everything that I used to
[30:58] underline a long time ago so I've been
[30:59] reading it over again do this don't do
[31:01] this do this don't do this I gotta do
[31:03] the vow do the vow this do the vow that
[31:06] Feast of Pentecost and do this and that
[31:08] and the other but that was gone in
[31:09] letter form but
[31:11] Redemption doesn't come from words on a
[31:14] page right right
[31:19] Redemption does not come from words on
[31:22] page amen amen it comes from the fleshly
[31:25] tables of your heart
[31:29] my heart
[31:31] all of our heart
[31:36] Redemption is you becoming the word amen
[31:38] right not the word becoming you right
[31:42] we want the word to fit us
[31:44] we want the word to fit this yeah but no
[31:48] no we got to be conformed to the word
[31:50] that's right right we got to be
[31:52] conformed to His Image amen be conformed
[31:54] to the person because you know what it's
[31:56] like um brother Tim was saying you know
[31:59] it's a person
[32:01] right it's a person that we're looking
[32:03] for not words
[32:05] it's a person that we're looking for
[32:07] right Redemption is not Pages or or
[32:11] books or forms or quotes
[32:15] right redemptions of Revelation amen
[32:18] amen he doesn't mind if I wrote a
[32:20] revelation I had down and give it to
[32:22] brother Donnie or give it to any one of
[32:24] you all right half of you wouldn't
[32:25] understand it and that doesn't make the
[32:27] Revelation wrong exactly right right
[32:30] right
[32:31] because like brother Tim Calhoun did he
[32:33] did a good job of it when we were having
[32:35] a ministers meeting he took a piece of
[32:37] paper that had the words of Silent Night
[32:39] on it but he tore them up in a different
[32:41] place and he gave them out to the
[32:42] pastors and told them said
[32:45] each one of us has our own piece of
[32:47] paper
[32:48] right
[32:49] but when they come together they got to
[32:51] make the words of Silent Night not Away
[32:54] in a Manger right
[32:56] so we each have our part to do you've
[32:59] got your part you may not I couldn't
[33:00] understand what was on mine I can read
[33:02] the part of it but somebody else could
[33:04] right that was a good analogy all right
[33:06] because there are levels of
[33:08] understanding but we need to find those
[33:10] levels and we need to get in them
[33:14] we don't need to be well we'll talk
[33:16] about in just a minute but let's go to
[33:17] Ephesians 1 7.
[33:20] because here is redemption
[33:22] in whom we have Redemption through his
[33:25] blood
[33:26] right not through words on a paper right
[33:33] the Forgiveness of sins according to the
[33:35] riches of his grace
[33:37] I love what brother Jason said if y'all
[33:39] didn't get listen to it
[33:41] um the watch not service he talks about
[33:43] repentance you say we're bro now we're
[33:46] past that are we
[33:49] he said repent means to quit doing what
[33:52] you're doing right
[33:53] that's right and turn and go in the
[33:56] other direction right right
[34:01] repent
[34:03] it's not to say I'm sorry all right well
[34:05] that's right amen not to say I'm sorry
[34:08] right think about it
[34:10] the Bible says Godly sorrow right you
[34:14] got to be sorry for what you did right
[34:15] and that leads you to repentance amen
[34:18] right
[34:19] that's the problem in the Old Testament
[34:22] they weren't sorry yeah they were just
[34:25] sorry yeah
[34:27] and that's the thing that we are we're
[34:30] not just sorry we're sorry yeah we're
[34:32] sorry a bunch of people
[34:34] but we have Redemption to its highest
[34:37] degree amen right that's it we're at the
[34:41] Apex
[34:43] of redemption right
[34:47] but to let her killeth
[34:51] every time you read that
[34:53] it's going to change you one way or the
[34:55] other right
[34:57] Better or Worse right every time you
[35:01] walk in here and every time you leave
[35:03] every time you hear the word preach
[35:06] you're either going to be better right
[35:07] are you going to be a worker right amen
[35:11] right and what's worse
[35:14] worse may not mean it's you
[35:17] think
[35:18] less of the Lord
[35:22] you have the Lord on your mind all the
[35:23] time I think somebody I you know this is
[35:25] just me I don't listen to a lot of tapes
[35:28] because I don't like listening I'd
[35:29] rather read so I read a lot of books so
[35:32] I don't listen to a lot
[35:33] but you know sometimes I I accuse
[35:36] brother Timbo and I know he doesn't mind
[35:37] me telling my cute Brother Timbo we we
[35:40] were traveling together when we worked
[35:42] with parents and get sticked up
[35:45] headphones in his ears and he'd listen
[35:47] to a tape over and over and over all day
[35:49] all day all day
[35:51] and I said Tim you need less than
[35:53] something else every once in a while
[35:55] because that could be repetition yeah
[35:57] right that's not going to drive the
[35:59] devil away that's right if you're doing
[36:01] that just not just the devil the way
[36:03] that ain't gonna drive the devil away
[36:04] right right no you got to realize that
[36:07] you gotta listen to what's being said
[36:09] right
[36:10] and Let It Drop from here to here
[36:12] because the letter kills from here right
[36:15] but the spirit gives life
[36:18] that's what he said right the letter
[36:20] kill it you're supposed to listen to
[36:22] what the spirit says to the churches
[36:24] yeah not the letter
[36:27] what the spirit says to the churches
[36:29] let's go to Hebrews chapter 5. a quote
[36:32] here in 1957.
[36:34] and I'm just going to read you a few
[36:36] things
[36:37] only got about 10 quotes We're Not Gonna
[36:39] Be We're not gonna be low and it was the
[36:42] same in the Old Testament but Paul being
[36:45] well trained and knew the scriptures by
[36:47] the word but you see the scriptures no
[36:49] matter how well you know them
[36:52] if the spirit doesn't Quicken them
[36:55] then the letter Kelly that's what the
[36:58] Ten Commandments did in the Old
[36:59] Testament it killed those people right
[37:01] right the letter killed them it
[37:03] condemned them every single day
[37:06] because there was no Spirit to get in
[37:07] those people to where they could live
[37:09] what they were reading that's right
[37:11] right all right
[37:13] but that's not so now
[37:15] unless you don't have the spirit right
[37:17] and then the letter will kill you the
[37:19] spirit giveth life see it must be
[37:21] quickened or Made Alive by the spirit
[37:23] if the spirit doesn't live in the word
[37:26] and make it a reality to you
[37:29] then the letter is just intellectual
[37:31] right that's right
[37:33] and it's not but well let me let me read
[37:35] the rest of the quote
[37:37] that's where we have so many confessed
[37:40] Christians today our professed Christian
[37:42] is that intellectual conception of
[37:45] Christ right
[37:47] but now look
[37:50] what we were talking about a few minutes
[37:51] ago in the book of Acts that man had an
[37:54] intellectual conception of the Old
[37:56] Testament and could preach Christ to the
[37:59] people right
[38:01] exactly right but if he would have
[38:04] continued on that way that letter would
[38:06] have killed him
[38:07] and not the Spirit come because of them
[38:10] you should receive Holy Ghost since you
[38:11] believe
[38:13] and man when they were filled with the
[38:14] Holy Ghost man they went out signs and
[38:16] wonders and doing things and doing
[38:17] things of God so we can hear all the
[38:20] word we want to and that's what I want
[38:21] to caution each and every
[38:24] let's go to this next quote and they
[38:26] don't want to make a statement
[38:28] believe it or not is what God put on my
[38:29] heart
[38:30] there's a man here that can turn on the
[38:32] light
[38:33] so life is only by the word of God made
[38:35] manifest life comes only by the word of
[38:38] God made manifest right
[38:42] as long as it's just in the book like
[38:44] this it still can be questioned exactly
[38:48] but when it's made manifest and you see
[38:51] the product of what it spoke of
[38:54] right the Old Testament couldn't produce
[38:56] the product right
[38:59] Christ had to come produce the product
[39:01] and then had to come back in me and you
[39:03] to practice it right
[39:07] but when it's made manifest and you see
[39:09] the product of what it spoke of being
[39:11] manifested then that is light on the
[39:14] word see that's what brings the word
[39:17] said so and then when it comes to pass
[39:19] that is life and light light bringing
[39:22] Life Light brings life amen right right
[39:27] so that's what we got to do
[39:29] I told myself here I said stop
[39:33] and I want to caution each and every one
[39:35] of us
[39:37] because my goal this year is to get
[39:39] closer to God Amen right and it's
[39:41] getting closer to God I hope I can draw
[39:43] you closer to God right that's what I
[39:46] was telling the ministers the other day
[39:47] I don't I I don't come to see brother
[39:49] Gerald Hughes or I don't come to see
[39:51] brother so and so when we have ministers
[39:53] meeting I have you on my mind
[39:57] you the Bible says Hebrews then I tell
[40:00] them Hebrews 13 11 says we watch for
[40:04] your soul
[40:06] we're a Watchman that watches over your
[40:09] soul brother
[40:10] you know why
[40:13] can't watch over your own yeah exactly
[40:18] wow I got some old memes but no amens on
[40:21] that one
[40:23] your sheep we're sheep when I say weed
[40:26] but I mean all of us we're sheep we have
[40:28] to be led amen amen that's just the way
[40:30] we are
[40:32] that's why there is do's and don'ts to
[40:34] this yeah
[40:37] but it's the tender hand of Jehovah
[40:42] it brings it and tells it to where it's
[40:45] supposed to be called but stop trying
[40:49] to figure this thing out right
[40:52] I'm telling every one of you stop trying
[40:55] to know something that somebody else
[40:58] don't know right I told you on Sunday's
[41:00] good class
[41:01] stop it right
[41:03] that's intellectual that's not the devil
[41:07] don't try to be a preacher right
[41:11] okay right don't try to be a preacher
[41:13] huh
[41:14] don't try to figure it out right right
[41:19] stop it I'm saying it again stop it
[41:23] you'll get ahead of God that's right
[41:25] yeah
[41:27] you'll get ahead of this program exactly
[41:30] sure the prophet said he said I've seen
[41:32] scrap heaps of ministers what going out
[41:35] above God's program right ahead of God
[41:38] can you get ahead of God treat him yeah
[41:41] that means you're out of the world God
[41:43] right right that's right
[41:45] so let's stop it stop trying to figure
[41:48] this thing out right
[41:50] because you're only going to get an
[41:51] intellectual conception of it and you're
[41:53] going to do just like the preachers do
[41:55] when we have ministers meeting we have
[41:57] ministers meetings and I'm sorry
[41:58] preachers
[42:00] we're just like that somebody brings a
[42:02] quote and we go off in that direction
[42:04] trying to either prove it right or prove
[42:07] it wrong yeah oh yeah sorry you do the
[42:09] same thing yeah
[42:12] you don't get a call oh here you'll get
[42:14] something over here you'll get this over
[42:15] here right quit
[42:19] this just folks will be the time of rest
[42:21] amen this is Ruth resting right this is
[42:23] the resting time while our Boaz
[42:27] does the right of redemption right which
[42:30] is the Holy Ghost right amen let him do
[42:33] the work in your life let him quit cry
[42:35] no human being ever is going to figure
[42:39] this thing out Friday man that's why the
[42:43] letter kill it you can write it down and
[42:44] you can bring dissertation after
[42:46] dissertation After books this thick all
[42:48] you want to never going to figure out
[42:51] what God's plan is exactly
[42:54] but you got to be a part of God's plan
[42:57] amen all right
[42:59] Matthew 6 verse 31.
[43:04] I know we read these sometimes
[43:06] when we come up to the day then where
[43:08] we're the squeezing and we don't have
[43:11] you know no what about now
[43:13] take no thought
[43:15] right take no thought saying what shall
[43:18] we eat
[43:19] or what shall we drink
[43:22] you ain't got in trouble doing that
[43:25] you kept asking by the time Ernest what
[43:27] do you all doing what are y'all drink
[43:28] whatever drink want to drink he emailed
[43:29] back he said Bud Light
[43:32] that stopped her he told you all that
[43:34] while he was here the other day so he
[43:37] don't mind me telling it but what shall
[43:39] we eat what should we drink or or
[43:41] whether All Shall we be clothed this is
[43:44] Bible right
[43:46] Matthew 10 verse 19 but when they
[43:49] deliver you up take no thought how
[43:53] We're not gonna have time
[43:55] to get our quotes together amen that's
[43:57] right
[44:01] but when they deliver you up take no
[44:02] thought how or what you shall say or
[44:05] speak
[44:06] for it shall be given you in that same
[44:09] hour
[44:10] that you shall speak right amen
[44:12] now how many really believe that amen
[44:16] better believe it
[44:19] here's Kate go back to Matthew 6 verse
[44:22] 33.
[44:23] this is our problem
[44:25] but seek ye first
[44:28] the kingdom of God
[44:30] right and all these things shall be
[44:32] added unto you
[44:34] all these things what
[44:38] keep my Commandments do all those things
[44:41] seek the kingdom of God first
[44:44] and his righteousness and all these
[44:46] things shall be added
[44:48] unto you
[44:49] John 14 15. see if you love me
[44:55] right
[44:57] three plane in it if you love me keep my
[45:00] Commandments that's right he said if you
[45:02] love me figure me out right
[45:06] he said if you love me keep what I've
[45:08] already said right amen per sample right
[45:11] resist the devil and he'll flee from you
[45:13] that's pretty powerful but pretty simple
[45:16] all right
[45:17] God put the provision in this word
[45:20] Glory we've got to believe what that
[45:22] word says right
[45:24] we've got to become believers
[45:27] John 14 16.
[45:29] and I will pray the father
[45:31] and he shall give you another comforter
[45:33] that he may abide
[45:35] with you
[45:36] forever right even the spirit of Truth
[45:40] he said oh I'm worried about
[45:45] get the Holy Ghost right
[45:47] yeah the Holy Ghost and he'll lead you
[45:49] into truth amen my dad said you may have
[45:52] got the holy ghost in the Pentecostal
[45:54] Church Presbyterian church but where you
[45:55] at now right you're at the word you're
[45:58] going to come to the word you're not
[45:59] going to say once you hear the word a
[46:01] message exactly it's gonna click and
[46:04] it's gonna draw you to that right
[46:06] because the word cannot say something
[46:08] the spirit doesn't say
[46:10] all right all right
[46:11] so let's not be scared let's not let's
[46:13] let's not be so because remember
[46:18] nine times out of ten in the prayer line
[46:20] if you will listen to what rotherham's
[46:21] saying he uses the word nervous
[46:26] thousands of times
[46:28] you're just nervous right you're nervous
[46:32] about something and it's got your heart
[46:33] fluttering it's got your body you get
[46:35] nervous and I promise you one thing
[46:37] ain't no drug going to help you right
[46:39] right man call this nerve is she it's
[46:42] where is it coming from though thoughts
[46:44] in your mind right right you can't do
[46:46] that you're the only one who can change
[46:47] those thoughts in your mind right man
[46:49] God can change for us all right I will
[46:51] pray the father and he shall give you
[46:52] another comforter that he may abide with
[46:54] you forever even the spirit of Truth
[46:56] whom the world cannot receive so yes we
[46:58] do have something the world cannot
[47:00] receive right right
[47:01] but it's because they don't have the
[47:03] Holy Ghost and we do
[47:08] whom the world cannot receive
[47:10] because it seeth him not right
[47:14] it understandeth him not but it doesn't
[47:17] see him either the only way it's going
[47:19] to see is through who
[47:21] me and you right neither knoweth him but
[47:25] ye know him for he dwelleth with you and
[47:28] shall be in you amen let's skip on down
[47:31] to John 14 25

[47:39] but the comforter which is the Holy

[47:50] you know that God hold up he shall teach
[47:53] you all things and bring all things to
[47:56] your remembrance said how many times
[47:59] have you been talking to somebody and
[48:00] they walk off and you go I should have
[48:03] said how many times have we done it
[48:04] before I had the quote brother around me
[48:06] I didn't bring it with me but he said
[48:07] how many times have you done that and he
[48:09] said God didn't want you to say it right
[48:10] right exactly and you're going like but
[48:13] brother dick bro dick it would help them
[48:15] it would help them if we'd have just
[48:17] said that that's right
[48:19] amen
[48:36] then why don't we trust what he said
[48:38] come all right that's right Ruth's
[48:40] resting read that we always love the
[48:42] light of redemption but Boyce told you
[48:44] she'll well you know where where Ruth is
[48:45] at she's sitting resting right waiting
[48:49] on him to finish because you know what
[48:50] she couldn't help him one bit right
[48:54] Ruth could not help Boaz do anything
[48:56] right she just waited until he did it
[49:00] right then when he did it he took her
[49:02] and said I receive you
[49:04] unto myself right and I'll marry you and
[49:08] we'll have children and then it went to
[49:09] do there like a bride in Christ but the
[49:12] comforter which is the only ocean the
[49:13] father will send in my name he shall
[49:15] teach you all things yeah
[49:19] that's right all things right amen
[49:22] life marriage business pleasure
[49:26] where we left him out yeah probably
[49:30] about all four no
[49:32] but teach you all things and bring all
[49:36] things to your remembrance whatsoever
[49:39] I've said unto you right because what
[49:41] I've said unto you brother it may not be
[49:43] the same thing I said in the sister Gail
[49:45] because she's not required to know what
[49:48] you know right but it's what I said unto
[49:51] you right you read that he didn't say
[49:53] what I said I hope everybody answer what
[49:55] I said unto you personal revelation is
[49:57] you and God Amen as one right right it's
[50:01] between you and God glory and bring all
[50:04] things to your remembrance whatsoever I
[50:06] have said
[50:07] unto you
[50:10] let's just say I don't understand better
[50:13] than I don't believe right
[50:15] because remember
[50:17] and here's what I want you to listen to
[50:19] what I'm saying because we are blessed
[50:21] and I'm not putting myself above nobody
[50:23] else but we are blessed to have some
[50:26] good teachers right
[50:28] and the Bible said a brother around said
[50:30] teaching places you in the body now so
[50:35] from now on it's easy now but in a few
[50:38] minutes I'm gonna get right where he's
[50:39] sitting
[50:40] well I'm gonna let the prophet do it
[50:43] because he does a lot better than I do
[50:45] but where are we going to come to the
[50:49] place to where
[50:50] God I know this is where you want me
[50:52] right here amen and I'm going to have
[50:55] the manifestation around me right
[50:59] that's what placing you in the body is
[51:01] all right amen if you're the finger
[51:03] don't try to be the tone right
[51:06] if you're the finger say God I know
[51:08] where you put me I'm right here
[51:11] I'm right here this is what I'm supposed
[51:13] to do
[51:14] I believe this is what I'm supposed to
[51:16] do
[51:17] so I just told him the other day I'd
[51:18] love to do this
[51:19] every day I can do this right here every
[51:22] day of my life but the pay is not very
[51:24] good yeah so but I'd love to do it but I
[51:28] do it without getting paid but something
[51:29] about a mortgage you have to worry about
[51:31] yeah every once in a while so
[51:34] but you know what
[51:36] I like to see people's lives changed I
[51:38] like to see people grow
[51:41] I like to see the the maturity and the
[51:43] sparkling eye instead of looking at
[51:45] people you know you can
[51:47] and everybody has their place in the 504
[51:49] minutes let me kind of walk on eggshells
[51:51] here everybody's got their place in a
[51:53] fightful Ministry but in evangelist he
[51:55] can come in he can get the will of God
[51:56] which he does get the will of God and I
[51:59] mean if he's a true holy ghost film my
[52:01] brother 40 and some of the other ones he
[52:03] can come in and he can Bam Bam Bam and
[52:05] either he can make you feel so good
[52:07] right and that's good right because he
[52:09] is telling you the truth sure and you're
[52:12] supposed to take that right
[52:14] but you know what I'm going to read your
[52:15] quote in a few minutes brother Robson it
[52:17] doesn't matter how much you dance how
[52:19] much you shout how much you sing in the
[52:21] spirit how much you run the aisles he
[52:24] said the devil don't care about that
[52:25] right
[52:27] he said but when he sees that life right
[52:31] reflect out through you he can't handle
[52:35] that right right so that's okay to have
[52:38] all the bubble dances and it's okay to
[52:39] have all that but you know it comes down
[52:42] to where
[52:43] God I know where I am when the bride
[52:45] realizes who she is
[52:47] and what she's doing here her position
[52:50] exactly
[52:51] that's when we're going to be an
[52:53] invincible Army not that we know all
[52:54] this up here nobody knows this down here
[52:56] exactly that's our problem people I hear
[52:58] it from a lot of you and I don't like it
[53:01] you try to be way up him forget about
[53:03] being way up here if God puts you up
[53:05] here that's cool amen
[53:07] but if you put yourself up here you're
[53:09] just going off let them out I mean you
[53:11] just but remember
[53:13] brother Ryan said don't jump so high
[53:16] let's read quote
[53:17] now we're going to get into
[53:20] the closet
[53:23] once more Lord
[53:27] because I'm not here for just the clap
[53:29] hands and shout and run up and down the
[53:30] aisle oh I believe in that sure but
[53:33] there's more than that to it it's got to
[53:36] have a foundation for this you see I
[53:38] believe that when you jump when you come
[53:40] back down
[53:41] live hot live then live as high as you
[53:44] jump right right and if you don't don't
[53:47] jump right
[53:49] see so then just always jump as high as
[53:52] you live
[53:53] man now that's what we should do because
[53:55] after all your life speaks louder than
[53:57] your testimony right
[54:00] you know the people know what you are by
[54:04] the way you live and the things you do
[54:05] right amen
[54:07] all right let's go to the next one
[54:10] foreign
[54:17] series and he's trying to bring a group
[54:20] of people into adoption right right but
[54:23] what's he having to cover
[54:24] in the very first one number one
[54:27] paragraph 54 right at the beginning of
[54:29] all the adoption series he said and
[54:31] there's where the church is failing
[54:32] today on that walk yeah do you know that
[54:36] even your own behavior can knock
[54:38] somebody else out of getting healed
[54:40] right
[54:41] exactly
[54:44] your misbehavior of unconfessed Sins Of
[54:47] You believers
[54:49] much less to unbelievers than the
[54:51] make-believers right can cause this
[54:54] church to bitterly fail right and at the
[54:56] day of judgment you'll be responsible
[54:57] for every bit of it oh you shall now
[54:59] wait a minute brother around well that's
[55:01] the truth right think of it yeah all
[55:04] right let's go to the next one
[55:09] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[55:11] and forever 1961.
[55:13] and then as we are Sons and Daughters of
[55:15] God and join ours with him in the
[55:17] Kingdom then we express him in our lives
[55:19] sometimes if many of us would just live
[55:22] our sermons
[55:23] instead of preaching it yeah
[55:25] I think it'd be better if we just go
[55:28] ahead and live the sermon you know it's
[55:30] a lot better to live me one than it is
[55:32] to preach me one I I believe because I
[55:35] can see your life
[55:41] Our Lives are and people know us
[55:46] no matter our actions is so loud it
[55:49] drowns Our Testimony right
[55:55] right
[55:57] depends on what we say right that's
[55:59] right if we are Christians and don't
[56:01] live it then people know better right
[56:04] but we are Christians and say we're
[56:06] Christians and live like Christians Our
[56:08] Lives will do it if we never said
[56:10] nothing else right
[56:14] you never said a word
[56:16] that word right
[56:18] wow
[56:21] Our Lives we are written Epistles read
[56:24] of all men I want to emphasize that it
[56:26] doesn't say just random Christians yeah
[56:28] he said read them all men
[56:30] so they watch how you walk and I was
[56:32] thinking the other day about being
[56:33] sealed by the Holy Spirit a seal is Mark
[56:36] listen what he explains this remember
[56:38] the seal on the front side and the back
[56:40] side right right which way he brings us
[56:42] out a seal is marked on both sides they
[56:45] see you coming
[56:46] and they see you going right
[56:49] look like a Christian coming you look
[56:52] like a Christian going so when you're so
[56:54] going so when you're sealed
[56:57] by the holy spirit amen all right let's
[56:59] go to the next one
[57:01] well it's getting quiet now I don't hear
[57:02] many amens you know
[57:05] it's the truth people that's right right
[57:08] the only God this World's Gonna See Is
[57:11] You and Me
[57:14] bro exactly
[57:18] if we have God at all yeah
[57:20] and now you know many people won't go to
[57:23] church they say well they've got a wrong
[57:25] impression of church
[57:30] yeah
[57:33] the men are black Rogue demons
[57:36] and they just got the wrong idea about
[57:38] it but I'll tell you what they do do
[57:41] they'll watch your life
[57:44] to see what you do right bro that's
[57:45] right I believe it was policy we were
[57:47] renting Epistles of God read them all
[57:49] men when you're on the street when
[57:51] you're at your work wherever you are
[57:52] somebody is watching you right
[57:54] and especially after you said and made
[57:57] your confession that you're a Christian
[57:59] right buddy I just witnessed they're
[58:02] really going to watch that's right
[58:03] they'll watch you much closer then
[58:06] and that gives an influence to the
[58:09] people that surround you
[58:11] and we should watch what we do because
[58:13] if we produce the wrong influence then
[58:15] we'd bring reproach not so much upon
[58:18] ourselves but upon what we claim to be
[58:20] right right
[58:21] Christians we bring it upon amen Christ
[58:25] right right that's the man that's it
[58:28] right
[58:31] and no one remember what brother Brown
[58:33] saw the
[58:34] invasion of of you know
[58:38] Jesus's head you know when something hit
[58:40] his head in the blood and fly this way
[58:41] remember he saw the vision he was going
[58:42] to condemn that woman
[58:45] and then the angel said that's what your
[58:48] sins are doing to him right we bring it
[58:51] upon Christ and and no one if we would
[58:54] think you would never want to bring our
[58:55] coach upon Christ but the wrong act at
[58:58] the wrong time will certainly call the
[58:59] wrong reflection toward the person
[59:01] that's watching you and everybody is
[59:03] watched when you profess
[59:06] to be a Christian amen right
[59:08] everybody watches your room
[59:11] let's go the next one you know what you
[59:13] know what the world is depending on you
[59:15] to be a Christian right
[59:17] amen whether they express it whether
[59:21] they ever say it because in Revel in
[59:24] Romans 8 it says the whole world is
[59:26] groaning and waiting for the
[59:28] manifestation of the sons of God the
[59:30] whole world the whole creation
[59:33] we will see Jesus
[59:35] that's the reason Christians I think
[59:37] it's so real tonight that we should live
[59:39] the right kind of a life because you see
[59:41] there's many people won't take time to
[59:43] read the Bible but they'll read you
[59:45] you're right see you're a written
[59:47] Epistle of God a real true born-again
[59:49] Christian is the word expressed again
[59:53] that's what Paul was saying you're
[59:55] writing Epistles you're expressing what
[59:57] I am preaching right all right because
[1:00:00] you're written Epistles of God red of
[1:00:02] all men what type of person should we be
[1:00:06] we can be if we know that our lives is
[1:00:08] an open Living Bible to the unbeliever
[1:00:12] to express God
[1:00:14] in our own life
[1:00:17] I told you many times
[1:00:20] I told you many times
[1:00:24] the thing that struck me more than
[1:00:25] anything is I wanted to live a life like
[1:00:27] that man right there
[1:00:29] false fails whatever don't worry about
[1:00:32] that
[1:00:33] I saw Christ
[1:00:35] and I know you guys at General Motors
[1:00:37] did too
[1:00:38] he was working his everyday life sure
[1:00:40] they might have been times when we all
[1:00:42] kind of you know get our props knocked
[1:00:44] out from under speed you know what it's
[1:00:47] the everyday life the everyday living
[1:00:50] sure you're going to have your ups and
[1:00:52] downs it's kind of like Investments
[1:00:53] you're going to have real good days and
[1:00:55] real bad days just pray that the good
[1:00:57] days are more than the bad day right
[1:00:58] right all right same way with anything
[1:01:00] you you got to be somewhere is what I'm
[1:01:03] saying somewhere you got to see that
[1:01:04] this is where you're at right your
[1:01:06] position and that's my goal this year to
[1:01:08] at least find my position I can't find
[1:01:10] yours right but we can try our best to
[1:01:12] preach you to your position right try to
[1:01:14] give you and you know help let God be
[1:01:16] available
[1:01:18] where he can work because remember it's
[1:01:21] a one-on-one between you and him amen
[1:01:23] all right yeah you can come here and you
[1:01:25] can listen but remember what brother
[1:01:26] Brown said we're the the only thing we
[1:01:28] do is we bring to your remembrance what
[1:01:31] God Said right
[1:01:33] try to break the scales back the spell
[1:01:35] that Satan's put on your eyes all
[1:01:36] through the week that's why I'm in it
[1:01:38] every church service I need scales took
[1:01:40] off mines I don't like missing them
[1:01:42] right I like being here because it takes
[1:01:45] a scales off the eye so you can see what
[1:01:47] God's already said about you this is not
[1:01:48] some new function right right that's
[1:01:51] right
[1:01:52] number 10. Mighty God unveiled before
[1:01:55] it's 1964 Moses Bale he was the Living
[1:01:58] Word to the people and today the people
[1:02:01] that are veiled are the same thing they
[1:02:03] are written Epistles realm all men not a
[1:02:06] new epistle
[1:02:09] that's what our problem is we don't want
[1:02:10] to become something new
[1:02:12] something better than somebody else I
[1:02:14] know more than this guy knows that's the
[1:02:16] devil folk that's the devil because he
[1:02:18] wanted a bigger Kingdom
[1:02:21] right he wanted a better Kingdom than
[1:02:24] God gave him if he would have stayed in
[1:02:25] his position he'd have been all right
[1:02:27] right he wanted a better Kingdom he
[1:02:29] wanted more knowledge all right forget
[1:02:32] that business
[1:02:33] get down get down with God and say God
[1:02:37] this is not something new
[1:02:40] but let me be the epistle that's already
[1:02:43] been written amen see but the epistle
[1:02:45] that's been written made manifest right
[1:02:46] God I want you to manifest nothing
[1:02:48] that's not in the Bible amen right he
[1:02:51] don't require that that's right he
[1:02:53] requires though that you
[1:02:55] do what is in the description
[1:02:57] it's those who believe the word and the
[1:02:59] promise of this day that God is pouring
[1:03:00] out his Spirit upon All Flesh and that
[1:03:02] is written a pencil and when a person
[1:03:04] tries to carmally impersonate that right
[1:03:08] fires
[1:03:14] your life's going to show what you are
[1:03:16] right
[1:03:18] number 11.
[1:03:21] just a few more
[1:03:23] and I think that I think that's a very
[1:03:24] fine example of we parents today to set
[1:03:26] an example before our children
[1:03:30] now you'll live your best and your worst
[1:03:32] at home yeah right all right
[1:03:36] that's right
[1:03:38] the man knew what he's talking about
[1:03:40] he was the parent he said you'll live
[1:03:43] your best
[1:03:45] and you're worst
[1:03:47] at home right and I think that our lives
[1:03:50] though the children might not just
[1:03:52] exactly act like they're noticing it but
[1:03:55] they are notice right don't you never
[1:03:58] think they are not because they're
[1:03:59] watching right not only the children are
[1:04:03] watching but the neighbors are watching
[1:04:05] not only the neighbors are watching but
[1:04:08] all that you are associated with right
[1:04:11] sure watch you right the people at your
[1:04:14] church watches you
[1:04:17] the people that you did the business
[1:04:18] with in the markets they're watching you
[1:04:20] right after your confession we should
[1:04:23] always try to reflect Christ in
[1:04:25] everything that we do
[1:04:27] well it's easy to do it here you got the
[1:04:30] atmosphere and you got the singing and
[1:04:32] you got this is the place where God's
[1:04:34] going to meet us and everything's these
[1:04:36] wonderful
[1:04:38] you're at your best and your worst at
[1:04:41] home
[1:04:43] number 12.

[1:04:50] I like this
[1:04:52] all right here was voices this is
[1:04:55] Revelation chapter four oh how we need

[1:05:34] the sale though yeah
[1:05:36] so we're supposed to live it then
[1:05:39] before the sealed open see he he didn't
[1:05:43] have as much Revelation as he did after

[1:06:37] influential speaker he'd he'd be oh no
[1:06:40] right oh no he said on him
[1:06:43] sometimes the devil just laughs at that
[1:06:45] exactly I'm glad Billy Graham and Oral
[1:06:47] Roberts probably wouldn't listen to that
[1:06:51] but he's making a point because y'all
[1:06:53] we're great men but they're great men
[1:06:55] for their time sometimes the devil just
[1:06:57] laughs at that
[1:06:58] he don't pay no more attention
[1:07:04] to and all the Seminary training and the
[1:07:06] devil just sits back and laughs at it
[1:07:10] but when he sees that life amen he does
[1:07:13] not know how to handle you living
[1:07:16] I've said many times before when when I
[1:07:19] became a Christian
[1:07:21] the devil lost a good fighter he lost a
[1:07:24] good guy he lost a good person and and
[1:07:26] that probably throwed him into
[1:07:28] convulsions more than anything was that
[1:07:30] when he would come and and try to get me
[1:07:33] to do what I used to do in the same you
[1:07:36] should all know it was all different it
[1:07:37] was all the way up here and it was
[1:07:39] flowers and I saw fireworks no I was I
[1:07:41] still had to go to work every day yeah I
[1:07:43] still had to go home every day I still
[1:07:44] had to live life yeah right I just lived
[1:07:47] it different
[1:07:49] because things were coming I would right
[1:07:51] I would take them and I would not do I
[1:07:55] remember what I used to do
[1:07:57] I told you many times I you know I could
[1:07:59] without saying without shooting you
[1:08:01] between eyes I could put you down pretty
[1:08:03] good with just my voice my my the way I
[1:08:05] said things the condescending attitude
[1:08:08] that I had that that everybody was down
[1:08:10] here and I was up here you know but that
[1:08:12] was the devil because that's his
[1:08:14] attitude he's up here and everybody else
[1:08:15] is down here right so that's the
[1:08:17] attitude so the best thing to do is do
[1:08:18] like brother Brown said do the vice
[1:08:20] versa right
[1:08:21] just try to say oh I'm sorry and go on
[1:08:24] you know it doesn't matter if you're
[1:08:25] right or wrong
[1:08:26] we got to live
[1:08:28] that life let's go go back to number 11
[1:08:31] Brother Joseph
[1:08:32] just for a second
[1:08:36] number 11.
[1:08:38] when you live your best and worst at
[1:08:41] home
[1:08:43] now I know there's some things and both
[1:08:45] my kids are here today praise the Lord
[1:08:48] but there are some things
[1:08:51] I told them the other not too long ago
[1:08:53] could have been a year or two ago
[1:08:57] that
[1:08:58] there's some things they're doing that I
[1:09:00] didn't do so they didn't get that from
[1:09:02] me some of you kids are going to get
[1:09:03] stuff just from the devil right so don't
[1:09:06] blame yourself and don't knock yourself
[1:09:07] all over the place for some of the
[1:09:09] things but let me tell you something
[1:09:11] I killed that child against the holy
[1:09:13] ghost or gets out one of the two
[1:09:15] you are their Holy Ghost right
[1:09:19] exactly you are their Holy Ghost right
[1:09:22] so if they're not doing this right you
[1:09:23] need to say something about it right if
[1:09:25] they're doing this wrong you need to say
[1:09:27] something about it
[1:09:30] what I don't care how old they are don't
[1:09:33] have another day
[1:09:35] she stays at home with us she's still
[1:09:38] gonna live under daddies what daddy says
[1:09:40] right daddy says because you're living
[1:09:43] under my roof daddy said I don't care if
[1:09:45] you're 35 one day so don't care if
[1:09:47] you're 35 years old if you put your feet
[1:09:48] under my table and I have to buy you
[1:09:50] groceries and buy you clothes you're
[1:09:51] gonna do what I tell you to do
[1:09:53] now if we would use that attitude but it
[1:09:55] was in an attitude where I knew he was
[1:09:56] telling the truth
[1:09:58] I mean that was the truth it wasn't just
[1:10:00] something to come out of my mouth quit
[1:10:02] being friends to kids yeah stop it stop
[1:10:06] being friends
[1:10:07] I can be a friend of your gift but you
[1:10:10] don't be a friend right now brother
[1:10:12] Brown said he said be a friend to him
[1:10:14] but now that remember Rebecca was 18
[1:10:16] years old now that's when they need a
[1:10:18] friend when they're 18 19 20 17
[1:10:20] somewhere in there they need a friend
[1:10:22] but you still are you still are
[1:10:24] responsible for that person right got it
[1:10:27] amen you're responsible for them I don't
[1:10:29] care what you who you think you are you
[1:10:31] are connected to them DNA wise right and
[1:10:35] God expects you I didn't bring a quote a
[1:10:36] few minutes ago I read it and I didn't
[1:10:38] put it in this but
[1:10:41] you know brother Brown said that I'm
[1:10:42] going to go back to my um part that I
[1:10:45] did about the uh
[1:10:46] husband and wife
[1:10:48] brother Brown said if your wife
[1:10:53] if your wife
[1:10:56] is not under the headship of you
[1:10:59] she's out of the will of God right
[1:11:02] and we'll never get right until she does
[1:11:05] right I'll bring that quote next time
[1:11:07] but I didn't bring it I wanted to keep
[1:11:08] it to about 12 quotes to about 8 30 when
[1:11:10] we get out of here it was about 25 after
[1:11:15] but all these things I didn't do those
[1:11:17] 12 sermons on how to live your life and
[1:11:19] how to treat your wife and how to treat
[1:11:20] your husband and how to treat your kids
[1:11:22] and I just went off in the
[1:11:24] Netherworld I guess somewhere but
[1:11:27] it's like I was telling them at the
[1:11:29] Master's meeting we
[1:11:31] we have to watch out for your soul right
[1:11:35] yes we are responsible right for you
[1:11:37] exactly
[1:11:40] we're responsible all right so what you
[1:11:43] do out there
[1:11:44] reflects here right
[1:11:48] everything you do out there
[1:11:50] reflects here right and we fail
[1:11:54] but my gosh people we're gonna have to
[1:11:56] come to a place
[1:11:58] right there
[1:12:01] we should always try to reflect Christ
[1:12:03] in everything right
[1:12:06] that we do amen everything exactly that
[1:12:10] we love right
[1:12:12] if we don't then we're wrong let's just
[1:12:14] admit we're wrong I told him downstairs
[1:12:16] in the same suit class let's just do
[1:12:18] like brother Jackson said the Bible says
[1:12:20] repent yeah and repent is not your
[1:12:23] saying I'm sorry Lord I'm sorry Lord I'm
[1:12:25] sorry Lord I'm sorry Lord why don't you
[1:12:26] just run it off on a sheet of paper and
[1:12:28] just hand it to them every time you do
[1:12:29] something
[1:12:30] when are we going to come to the place
[1:12:31] to where we don't do that no more right
[1:12:34] it's not part of us anymore
[1:12:37] I'm done with that that's being buried
[1:12:40] when you bury something it ain't gonna
[1:12:41] come back to life unless it's born again
[1:12:42] yeah man if you're born again it ain't
[1:12:45] dead right
[1:12:47] right right
[1:12:48] but if it's not born again it's dead
[1:12:50] right right dead means not bring it back
[1:12:52] up again
[1:12:54] that's what's been burning on my heart
[1:12:56] that that we as people
[1:12:59] we can't
[1:13:01] preach to the world
[1:13:04] thank God that we can get out to some
[1:13:06] that listen and that's great and we
[1:13:08] appreciate that
[1:13:12] but I like what brother Tim cross said
[1:13:14] that's kind of what struck me the other
[1:13:15] day was
[1:13:17] he said you know I dress like I do
[1:13:19] because I dress for where I'm going
[1:13:22] yeah remember that Sunday
[1:13:24] I dress for where I'm going right he
[1:13:27] said you don't see somebody in the
[1:13:28] airport just fixing to go to Alaska he's
[1:13:31] got on a pair of shorts short sleeves
[1:13:34] and a flowery top
[1:13:36] now you look at that guy and go I bet
[1:13:38] he's going to Florida yeah
[1:13:40] what he dresses for where he's going
[1:13:43] yeah
[1:13:45] that's pretty profound
[1:13:48] and I told him you know I was telling
[1:13:50] June the other day she was talking about
[1:13:52] um we were talking about her family and
[1:13:54] all you know thinking things and I
[1:13:56] thought about that when we thought about
[1:13:57] it when he said that I said you know
[1:13:59] that's what you can tell your family
[1:14:02] I dress different because I dressed from
[1:14:03] where I'm going right
[1:14:05] right if you dress like the world that's
[1:14:07] where you're going right well
[1:14:09] be dressed like Christians that's where
[1:14:11] you're heading for right right that's
[1:14:13] why you say well it's all do's and
[1:14:15] don'ts no it's all connected right it's
[1:14:18] all connected together sure it is on a
[1:14:20] paper
[1:14:21] do not do this and do this and don't do
[1:14:23] this the light brother Brown said he
[1:14:25] said I'm only going to spell woman won't
[1:14:27] put on a pair of pants right holy ghost
[1:14:29] woman one cutter half right that's
[1:14:31] pretty plain right all right get them
[1:14:33] born again
[1:14:34] and then start growing up the statue of
[1:14:37] a perfect man our problem is is we're
[1:14:39] wanting to get there
[1:14:41] without repentance right without a life
[1:14:43] live without somebody coming and say hey
[1:14:46] man I know you're a Christian because
[1:14:47] you act different
[1:14:48] you talk different you walk different
[1:14:51] you do different things than what you
[1:14:53] used to do right man I told you the
[1:14:55] story remember when I come back to the
[1:14:57] Lord we had our uh
[1:14:59] geez 20-year class reunion
[1:15:03] because I got born again there in 1998
[1:15:06] and then June of 1998 we had our
[1:15:08] 20th
[1:15:11] class reunion
[1:15:13] and I was voted the most changed guy
[1:15:15] there
[1:15:17] Hallelujah I've got the certificate for
[1:15:20] it
[1:15:22] they saw I was different now they were
[1:15:25] saying
[1:15:26] I changed physically yeah
[1:15:29] but when I sat down in that car Jim was
[1:15:31] gone on a cruise with you some of your
[1:15:33] sisters that went on that cruise she was
[1:15:35] she wasn't there and I sat down in a car
[1:15:37] and just started crying
[1:15:39] I said Thank You Lord amen yeah I said
[1:15:42] whether they see they only saw me for
[1:15:44] like of course I was part of the class
[1:15:47] um I was classifieds president so I had
[1:15:49] to meet with several of the seven or
[1:15:51] eight of the other girls and guys I had
[1:15:53] to meet with him and we had to get all
[1:15:54] the food ready and all that stuff so
[1:15:56] they saw me but the other 60 that I
[1:15:58] graduated with hadn't seen me before you
[1:16:01] know before the 20 years or 10 years and
[1:16:03] then when he come up and they wanted to
[1:16:05] know who's this guy who's this guy who's
[1:16:06] this guy you know what I didn't even
[1:16:07] dress like them my hair was fine
[1:16:10] I dress conservative
[1:16:12] so they could at least see that part of
[1:16:14] me was changed but when I got in the car
[1:16:16] I said God so much as you you've
[1:16:18] identified that that I've changed
[1:16:20] you've let that whole class
[1:16:23] see me as a changed person
[1:16:26] and that's always stuck with me but I
[1:16:28] want to ask you something
[1:16:31] can your family
[1:16:34] can your classmates
[1:16:37] can your business associate
[1:16:39] can the people you work with every day
[1:16:42] know that you are not the same person
[1:16:45] that they knew 20 years ago or not the
[1:16:49] same person that you knew 10 years ago
[1:16:50] or not the same person you knew two
[1:16:53] years ago
[1:16:54] there's no life and you walk through the
[1:16:58] when you walk through Walmart when you
[1:17:00] walk through anywhere you walk through
[1:17:03] you're a written epistle
[1:17:05] your God in letter form right right but
[1:17:09] you have moved off of that letter
[1:17:11] and become flesh right that's why in the
[1:17:14] beginning was the word
[1:17:16] the word was with God and the Word was
[1:17:18] God Amen all when Jesus was the word was
[1:17:21] made
[1:17:22] if you're the word who was it made flesh
[1:17:24] Among Us
[1:17:26] right right brother Nick make it
[1:17:28] personal
[1:17:29] and the word
[1:17:33] was made flesh amen
[1:17:35] Among Us right yeah
[1:17:38] all that's talking about Jesus
[1:17:41] I thought the scriptures that spoke of
[1:17:42] him spoke of us right
[1:17:46] see how we miss it we miss it in the
[1:17:50] walk right we miss it and every day
[1:17:54] ABC's right how many times did Brother
[1:17:57] Brown understand how many times did
[1:17:58] Brother Brown say how can I teach my
[1:18:00] people algebra
[1:18:03] and they don't even know their ABCs
[1:18:07] the Bible says Satan not the sending of
[1:18:10] yourself together and it says something
[1:18:13] about the mores that they approach it
[1:18:14] right
[1:18:16] we let ever a little absolute I want to
[1:18:19] tell you something people
[1:18:21] June's family and my other extended
[1:18:23] family that doesn't that they're not
[1:18:25] Christians they know one thing's for
[1:18:27] sure

[1:18:30] and I ain't gonna be home on Wednesday
[1:18:32] night right
[1:18:34] so what kind of testimony are you
[1:18:37] showing
[1:18:39] by Mission church right and being with
[1:18:41] them or being with a loved one by being
[1:18:43] with this one no make a stand right I'm
[1:18:46] going to church when you're going on
[1:18:47] right I want church when the game goes
[1:18:49] or not right
[1:18:52] that's what days always said that's
[1:18:53] that's been you want to be successful in
[1:18:56] life pick somebody that's successful in
[1:18:58] life
[1:19:00] and imitate that right at least try to
[1:19:02] fit yourself to it
[1:19:04] uh you know I you don't wanna be a
[1:19:08] recovering alcoholic and have 14
[1:19:09] alcoholic friends around you the whole
[1:19:11] time
[1:19:13] that's what repent means repent me get
[1:19:16] out of that change Gloria get away from
[1:19:18] that do something different
[1:19:22] telling you people we are a powerful
[1:19:24] church but I promise you our fluser
[1:19:26] stops done right
[1:19:27] our everyday walk in life should be that
[1:19:30] that man is a Christian that woman is a
[1:19:32] Christian right every day of our life
[1:19:35] not your Sunday and Wednesday that's
[1:19:37] right the devil has loves on Sunday and
[1:19:39] Wednesday amen did you come to church
[1:19:41] where he's at
[1:19:44] let's sing a song 272.
[1:19:56] the treasures
[1:20:52] you're happy
[1:21:06] before we Hallelujah I found a land of
[1:21:10] promise
[1:21:57] got into Canaan
[1:22:00] it was a Happy Land but they still had
[1:22:03] to fight right for every inch of ground
[1:22:07] that they possessed they had to get all
[1:22:10] them ice out right right that's the same
[1:22:12] thing with you and I we got to get all
[1:22:14] those ice out we got to get rid of the
[1:22:16] people that are squatters which is the
[1:22:19] devil on our property
[1:22:21] because we do have a land of promise
[1:22:23] Glory we do have a place that we can be
[1:22:26] happy
[1:22:26] we can be Christians and not be sad we
[1:22:29] can be Christians and not be uh tore up
[1:22:32] and broke down all the time all right
[1:22:33] that's right um
[1:22:35] my Lord Ruth would just she was so happy
[1:22:38] right she was resting Glory
[1:22:41] brother boy if it was something it would
[1:22:45] tear us to pieces if we knew we had to
[1:22:47] do it all ourselves yeah but Ruth just
[1:22:50] said Boaz
[1:22:52] amen you're the only one who can do it
[1:22:54] right and when we lay this thing down
[1:22:57] one day
[1:22:58] we're going to realize that sure
[1:23:00] it's not we it's not being Gibby they
[1:23:03] get it
[1:23:05] but remember one thing brother Brandon
[1:23:09] made a very profound statement he said
[1:23:11] this is my eye right God gave it to me
[1:23:14] but it came from God Amen and it's going
[1:23:17] back to God right all right that's right
[1:23:20] this is my eye this is my Holy Ghost
[1:23:25] didn't give his parents gave him what
[1:23:27] I'm looking at
[1:23:29] but the parent I can't see
[1:23:31] is the one that gave something I can't
[1:23:33] see unless he lives and out right once
[1:23:36] he lives it out then I see what's inside
[1:23:37] right amen that's why it's a work from
[1:23:40] the inside to justification
[1:23:42] sanctification
[1:23:44] you know
[1:23:45] I want to ask you a question
[1:23:50] how many of you have just sat down
[1:23:55] and went back through your life
[1:23:59] just sit down just go back through your
[1:24:00] life and you know that God and sure God
[1:24:03] does things for you know yourself he
[1:24:05] does things for you but it do you really
[1:24:07] it's what really made me think about it
[1:24:09] coming up to the end of the year there
[1:24:10] and and what brother Jason was preaching
[1:24:13] on repentance
[1:24:14] you know
[1:24:15] I want us to be not that we just come
[1:24:18] into this church and sit down right and
[1:24:20] become a message believe right
[1:24:23] um I I don't know a lot of you were here
[1:24:26] before I got here so I can't say this
[1:24:27] for everybody but but do we understand
[1:24:30] that brother Brown said talk about dry
[1:24:33] eye confession
[1:24:34] and that's what brother Jason was
[1:24:36] talking about he it was so laborious
[1:24:38] because Godly sorrow
[1:24:40] leads to repentance when we fall down on
[1:24:43] our knees and say God I've done
[1:24:45] something wrong
[1:24:46] am I your child
[1:24:49] is it something because when I told you
[1:24:52] many times before only in my experience
[1:24:54] when I came up out of the water I just
[1:24:55] felt so clean and so empty it's like
[1:24:59] it's like I had scales on Me Brother
[1:25:00] Gary and then those scales just just
[1:25:02] when I come out of the water they just
[1:25:04] weren't there anymore yeah man June and
[1:25:06] I just hugged and cried for for 10
[1:25:08] minutes you know but but I gave my heart
[1:25:10] to the Lord right here right
[1:25:13] and I didn't just say God I'm sorry for
[1:25:14] what it didn't turn around walked out
[1:25:16] all right
[1:25:18] I labored for months right oh yeah
[1:25:20] trying to get rid of some of the things
[1:25:22] Brother Gary
[1:25:23] man I labored from I wished it would
[1:25:25] have been just a one one moment deal
[1:25:27] yeah but I labored for months trying to
[1:25:30] get rid of some of the things right and
[1:25:32] here I've labored for years now trying
[1:25:34] to get rid of some things but there's
[1:25:35] some things that are dead
[1:25:37] and when it's dead
[1:25:39] don't dig it up right amen it's buried
[1:25:43] right
[1:25:46] one other thought
[1:25:50] Christianity
[1:25:52] was before brother random got here right
[1:25:57] Christianity started on the day of
[1:25:59] Pentecost when God failed 120 people
[1:26:01] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:26:03] they went out doing signs and wonders
[1:26:06] and miracles and they started going out
[1:26:10] into the places and they knew that that
[1:26:12] was God in those people right see the
[1:26:15] people around them knew that that was
[1:26:16] God in the people right people around
[1:26:20] them knew that
[1:26:22] Mighty group of people in the book of
[1:26:24] Ephesus they have a huge church for the
[1:26:26] boy they had 12 people
[1:26:29] amen but you know what
[1:26:33] give me 12 Holy Ghost fail people
[1:26:36] versus 500 people in a sanctuary I'll
[1:26:39] take the 12 every time man right right
[1:26:40] because you got unbelievers or maybe I
[1:26:43] don't know what kind of I don't know
[1:26:44] what you do with the quote for brother
[1:26:45] Brown said in every congregation there's
[1:26:47] a make-believers unbelievers and True
[1:26:48] Believers if if the Church of Baptist
[1:26:50] was all full of the Holy Ghost and there
[1:26:51] was only 12 of them maybe they had some
[1:26:53] ministers a few days but what I'm saying
[1:26:56] is is like Saint Martin Saint Martin was
[1:26:59] not satisfied until every person in his
[1:27:02] church was filled with a holy ghost amen
[1:27:04] wasn't satisfied
[1:27:07] maybe that's the urge that I have
[1:27:09] is that if we can get everybody full of
[1:27:11] the Holy Ghost sure it's not going to
[1:27:12] take care of all of our human problems
[1:27:15] but maybe it will help our spiritual
[1:27:17] problem right it will help our ups and
[1:27:19] downs and driving read
[1:27:22] intervale's Precinct that's a long time
[1:27:23] ago but really Intervale it used to be
[1:27:25] Intervale but they put an interval but
[1:27:28] read that
[1:27:29] it's a really good book you preached it
[1:27:30] like 1956. look what brother Brown was
[1:27:33] doing back in the in back in 47 to 63
[1:27:36] watching he's he's
[1:27:38] getting the people born again he's
[1:27:40] getting the people trying to look toward
[1:27:42] God look toward what God's fixing to do
[1:27:44] and then because remember and then the
[1:27:46] healing service was debate on the hook
[1:27:48] right but they kept nibbling at the bait
[1:27:52] and didn't get the hook the hook was a
[1:27:54] revealed word of God that he was
[1:27:56] stepping into a new part of his ministry
[1:27:57] well same way with you and I we've got
[1:28:00] to be born again first then we got to
[1:28:02] have a walk through God and
[1:28:04] bring us and give us the hook right
[1:28:06] right you don't want us to stay on the
[1:28:09] bed he wants us to take the hook because
[1:28:10] when did we take the hook we go out of
[1:28:12] here we leave up we get taken out of
[1:28:14] this water
[1:28:15] called the world
[1:28:16] you love the Lord amen let's consecrate
[1:28:19] ourselves let's make ourselves more
[1:28:21] aware of you so I don't care what
[1:28:23] anybody thinks about me you're a liar
[1:28:25] right that's right you're a liar right
[1:28:27] that's right you do care what people
[1:28:29] think about right I do I can brother
[1:28:31] Branch it off that guy was lying when he
[1:28:33] said I don't I don't care if anybody
[1:28:35] says it's a good sermon he says that man
[1:28:36] was not telling the truth right he said
[1:28:39] I like for somebody to Pat me on the
[1:28:40] back he was human he didn't want to tell
[1:28:42] no story he didn't want to lie he said I
[1:28:45] appreciate somebody telling me good
[1:28:47] sermon to Pat me on the back you know
[1:28:50] electrics to all be Christians amen but
[1:28:54] let's reflect it so that they can see us
[1:28:56] Glory it's easy to be Christians right
[1:28:58] here because we know not to say bad
[1:29:00] words we don't have to lie or do these
[1:29:01] little things but when we're out there
[1:29:03] around a bunch of liars and a bunch of
[1:29:04] drugs and a bunch of Thieves and a bunch
[1:29:06] of this a bunch of that the other how do
[1:29:07] we live right that's right how do we
[1:29:09] live that's good that's right because
[1:29:11] they're going to watch you and when you
[1:29:13] profess to be a Christian
[1:29:14] you better live it to the T amen because
[1:29:17] they're gonna be picking Every Little
[1:29:20] Feather they can find they're going to
[1:29:21] be picking on right but you know what
[1:29:23] beloved Christian Life
[1:29:25] doesn't matter you pick all I want to
[1:29:28] man oh sure they're gonna say oh you
[1:29:30] didn't do this well so what
[1:29:32] but what do they think about you when
[1:29:34] you walk away I told somebody the other
[1:29:36] day
[1:29:37] I don't know who it was I believe it was
[1:29:39] day on it it worked we were talking
[1:29:40] about something I said you know even
[1:29:42] when I was a sinner when I own my own
[1:29:44] business I could go back today to every
[1:29:46] Banker I could go back to everybody that
[1:29:49] I dealt with I could go back to every
[1:29:51] customer that I ever had even when I was
[1:29:54] a sinner
[1:29:56] even when I was a sinner
[1:29:58] I could go back and face every one of
[1:30:00] those people in my life yeah that's
[1:30:02] right now I tell them I lived a bad life
[1:30:04] and they knew I said bad words and did
[1:30:06] bad things but as far as my dealings of
[1:30:08] my personal life and my business
[1:30:12] to me that was important
[1:30:14] so I could go back to anybody in my past
[1:30:17] life now sure there's a lot about after
[1:30:18] a bit David but in my past life though
[1:30:21] it would not follow me
[1:30:25] it wouldn't follow me right because when
[1:30:28] you get born again it cuts that thing
[1:30:29] off right man he cuts that thing off and
[1:30:33] then then you might have to go repent
[1:30:35] not having to go repent
[1:30:37] for things I've done but
[1:30:39] like Daddy's always said those bankers
[1:30:41] and all those people they know how many
[1:30:43] parents were why because that was just a
[1:30:45] common thing for us to do but that
[1:30:47] reflects too
[1:30:49] on our Christian Life right being
[1:30:51] Christians in everything that we do
[1:30:53] every Walk of Life you go to Walmart and
[1:30:56] somebody's speech across to you or jumps
[1:30:58] in line so what big deal leave him in
[1:31:00] line
[1:31:01] right they don't know where they're
[1:31:03] going right they don't have a clue where
[1:31:05] they're going right
[1:31:06] why are you mad at people
[1:31:08] I had to really work on people cutting
[1:31:11] me off
[1:31:12] driving car
[1:31:14] yeah but it's gone I don't do that no
[1:31:16] more don't bother me but again I'm like
[1:31:19] God Save The Soul right forget about me
[1:31:22] being mad at them
[1:31:23] don't be mad I don't feel sorry for him
[1:31:25] right say God I'd be just that if it
[1:31:28] wasn't for you right I'd be just that I
[1:31:30] would act just like that if it wasn't
[1:31:32] for you no then you can say God thank
[1:31:34] you for what you've done in my life
[1:31:36] right what a difference he's made in my
[1:31:38] life this power the heavenly father we
[1:31:40] pray Lord tonight we've said something
[1:31:42] new we'll be pleasing to you and
[1:31:45] Lord it will help your people father
[1:31:47] because it's not me it's not brother
[1:31:49] Dale it's not P it's not the preachers
[1:31:51] it it's you speaking through US Warren
[1:31:54] it's you doing the work through all of
[1:31:56] our lives that we can see a reflection
[1:31:58] of you Lord and not a reflection of a
[1:31:59] human being
[1:32:00] Lord will she Christ and everything that
[1:32:03] we do that is our work on Earth Here
[1:32:05] Lord when it's done we can lay down all
[1:32:08] these things or that you're feeding and
[1:32:10] say father we've done the best we can do
[1:32:13] and he's you will say that Dave welcome
[1:32:15] in

[1:32:19] fight
[1:32:20] you've kept the faith enter into the joy
[1:32:22] of the Lord has been waiting on you from
[1:32:24] the foundation of the world oh there's
[1:32:26] no other there's no other voice
[1:32:29] there's no other voice that I want to
[1:32:31] hear Lord he's your except your voice
[1:32:33] said well done
[1:32:35] whether the world thinks I've done well
[1:32:37] or not or family or whatever but Lord
[1:32:40] when you said
[1:32:42] well done my good and faithful servant
[1:32:45] Lord you started it in in the New Birth
[1:32:48] when you said this is my beloved Son and
[1:32:49] who I please as well
[1:32:52] Lord you send that to all of your
[1:32:54] children
[1:32:55] you're pleased to dwell now Lord let us
[1:32:57] reflect that back out to you Lord
[1:32:59] let that be our desire in our heart
[1:33:01] today is to to live a sermon
[1:33:04] not so much as trying to tell people
[1:33:07] what we know but Lord don't let our
[1:33:10] lives drown that out
[1:33:12] let our lives live exemplary to you Lord
[1:33:16] let us take up as it would take a
[1:33:18] checklist or a checkup and and see what
[1:33:22] our problems might be and Lord let it
[1:33:24] reflect through the word let it reflect
[1:33:26] through our pastor Lord and let it not
[1:33:28] be a reproach on him that we go out and
[1:33:31] do something wrong or or do something to
[1:33:33] someone else and then get back to him
[1:33:35] Lord that that we've done we're his
[1:33:37] children and Lord he has to answer for
[1:33:40] the things that we do and and God forbid
[1:33:43] that we'll do anything that would harm
[1:33:45] our actions in our in our ways and our
[1:33:49] doings that would be contrary to the to
[1:33:51] the ministry of this church Lord
[1:33:53] we're a family here we have family
[1:33:56] members and this is the greatest family
[1:33:58] that ever lived on the face of the Earth
[1:34:00] you can have Rockefellers and you can
[1:34:02] have all those different ones but they
[1:34:05] can have all those names but if they're
[1:34:07] not born again they're nothing
[1:34:08] I don't care how much money then how
[1:34:10] much power and Prestige they have
[1:34:12] doesn't matter how many presidents of
[1:34:15] the United States you took hands with
[1:34:17] Lord but have we shook the tender hand
[1:34:20] of Jehovah
[1:34:22] and we ask you Lord
[1:34:24] Purge our life
[1:34:27] and we ask you to just take full control
[1:34:29] and and Lord if we be one with you

[1:34:36] desire Lord

[1:34:40] we'll act more like you father
[1:34:42] and the things that we do will be
[1:34:44] pleasing in your sight
[1:34:46] Lord forgive us of our sins and our many
[1:34:48] mistakes
[1:34:50] the false and fails that we have towards
[1:34:52] you Lord
[1:34:53] give us this day our daily bread and let
[1:34:55] it not be Lord cast out into the water
[1:34:56] and and not return void you said it
[1:34:59] would you said it would absolutely
[1:35:01] accomplish what it said it would
[1:35:03] accomplish for it and I pray that you do
[1:35:05] that in our lives Lord consecrator
[1:35:07] sanctifies for this journey that we're
[1:35:10] on Lord that it's getting closer to the

[1:35:29] being with sister hope Lord and blessing
[1:35:32] her Lord and we look at it as humans and

[1:35:39] and testify and the dad's standing there
[1:35:42] realizing in in his in his human mind he
[1:35:45] was afraid and and maybe had doubts and
[1:35:48] and fears but Lord
