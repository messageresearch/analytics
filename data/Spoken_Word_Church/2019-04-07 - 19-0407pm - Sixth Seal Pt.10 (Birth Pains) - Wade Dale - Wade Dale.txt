sealed part ten revelation six let's bow our heads do Heavenly Father we pray Lord Lord excuse me that you would Lord be the active participant in the service Lord we know as we were just thinking back there in the back that everybody's a lot of crammed in today Lord a lot of things that we did Lord now pray that you'd settle us just for a little while keep us strengthened give us a jolt of energy you can do that Lord because one day Caleb oh my think of a man 80 years old walks up to Joshua and been with him for a long time and he says Joshua's giving out land and and my Caleb says hmm I'm not don't feel any worse than I did when I was 40 Lord that had to be you because Lord naturally that can't happen but Lord you can supernaturally charge a group of people Lord that we can Orden

you promised me a long time ago with Lord you promised us I've already changed you promised us a resurrection you promised us Lord a rapture and we pray Lord that you just touch us and be with us we were the ones that are sick and not with us today Lord we pray that you would touch the ones that are traveling many families have traveling ones that are going different places Lord we all like to take a little side trip every once in a while there's nothing wrong with that but Lord I pray that you would just sanctify them in that journey because the devil sure would like to disrupt it father be with sister Christine and little Zoe Lord that you would break that fever fine and that they'll come back tomorrow rejuvinated long trip from Canada in a car but Lord you are our provider you're

bless now be with the ones all the birthdays that have been announced that you would be with each one Lord during this time of earthly journey of our birthdays that coming up Lord we pray that you touch each one forgive us of our sins Lord and bless us in Jesus name Amen revelation 6 verse 12 that I'll be held we had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake Sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it was rolled together as a scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and Island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men of the rich men and the chief captains in the mighty men and every bondman and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains had just got everybody nobody was left out o world instead to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath has come and who shall be able to stand let's read Romans 8 verse 19 while we're standing where we were talking about a little bit more today than we did last Wednesday for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body you may be seated in or that is blessing reading the god bless you this afternoon now what we've been talking about we kind of got a little bit on birth pains and this would be birth pains part two or number two and we know that this seal that we're talking about the sixth seal is the judgment seal of the Bible it is the Tribulation Period it is the wrath of God poured out it is it is persecution for the foolish version and for the 144,000 and the two witnesses they will be persecuted they and the foolish virgin the prophet of God said they would be hunted down like dogs and they would have to give their life for the gospel all right so but now the bride will not be there that's not that we are a special group of people he made us that way I was telling them downstairs and if I Burton is forgive me because they see some barbecue okay so we and we just ate it just a few minutes ago so Lord keep it down but who they man that they both Donnie you stay awake at least he's honest he's got toothpicks there you go I know it's rough listen it's rough but let's just focus just for a few minutes and then we'll then you know what then we'll go out stop for two hours and stand around talk anyway so anyways so the sixth seal is the Tribulation Period and luck of I'll say this again I'm gonna say it every service if I can remember it the greatest revelation if you never get another revelation is is that that Holy Ghost you got inside of you I was telling them downstairs in a Sunday School class that Holy Ghost this is it right here this is your whole ego okay this is my Holy Ghost I got it right here in my hand if you've got this Holy Ghost forget about the tribulation forget about the judgment forget about the millennium because you're going there then you're in a space capsule and you can't get out of it so if you got the Holy Ghost you're gonna be either if you pass away you're gonna be resurrected you're going to be changed you're going to go in a rapture you're going to go to the you missed one this morning wedding supper go to the wedding supper if you all will go back online brother Joe can pull it up for you about 15 years ago I preached the sermon on a timeline from Adam to the future home if you'll if you'll look at it online you can see the whole piece of paper and it's got it all sectioned out but I wish brother Dale would preach on a to preaching all and all it should go from Adam all the way to the future hold on amen but you got you got a free ticket a free trip that's what I was telling them downstairs we sometimes and then and I like to I like to delve into some of the finer points of the message but I really don't care what we're going to eat in a millennium I really don't care what we're going to and then you understand what I mean if I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't know when I get there if I take a body change I were we where are we gonna go well it who cares really really come on people what street am I gonna able to live in in the future home and I told them downstairs I'm gonna tell you I said look there's a wall right here and that's called a body change until we understand that we're not going until we understand this all that is just frivolous things that that that people that you'll forget half of it but the body changed that's what we're looking at that's right here on our nose if you're looking for something look for the resurrection and the body change we're looking for the resurrection of the Dead Saints and until they resurrect we're just going to keep on going and then all of a sudden maybe one day we're going to be one of them but the sixth seal though it shows me that I don't have to go through the tribulation I've already been changed I've already went to where I remember I told you we've already been held theophany of God went to hell to preach to the souls and friends and if you've got that st. theophany in you today if you don't you got a different one you got that same theophany that theophany was already went to hell that theophany understands it was talking about Jesus walking on earth this morning if you want to watch that you can downstairs but I really think that but the Bible says Jesus learned by the things that he suffered and being made perfect became the author of our salvation eternal salvation amen so when he got when he was captured inside that human body there were some things that that he couldn't understand brother Ram said he know he didn't know about his second coming now you think me and Almighty God he'd know that but there were some things that had to filter through that brain of his just like through yours and I'm getting off the subject here sorry Aaron I'm going down the rabbit route praise the Lord I'm back now so forget about that so the sixth seal is the tribulation seal but if that seal opens to me and you listen if that still opens to me and you in a spiritual form we don't have to worry about that tribulation period we don't have to worry about sure there's going to be persecution and many things that are gonna they're gonna listen we're persecuted already look at that woman with a long hair looks like a grandmother he won't take he won't take a little beer he won't take a look who's he think he is see that's persecution but not only the degree is was that the foxes Book of Martyrs that was persecution but remember persecution comes from someone else all right it doesn't come I mean persecution is not having any money persecution is not having something to eat persecutions not having a car persecution is when one person persecutes another person that's why it's called persecution all right so we're we're persecuted already because of what we believe and like I was telling them downstairs we must be careful to not go into these things and and say well nobody's gonna know no listen the government knows everything we do they know our doctrine they know everything we do they know where we live they know our social security number they know what we say on the phone that Google if you've ever googled anything you're in their big Google mind up there somewhere and I know nobody in this building's ever googled anything mmm-hmm yeah and that guy setting the pet control towers going yeah you have but so so so let's not try to figure out let's don't do like somebody said well why don't we we need to put some aluminum fall over our head you know or or put some aluminum fall over our set list it's gonna be God Almighty that's gonna have to protect us there is nothing you can do to protect yourself you must be income income pass by the Word of God to get out of here oh you can try to figure out how we can do this or how we can survive this or how we can do this what does it matter they're going to know where we're at and listen this is how close it is this is how close it is do you know that when the terrorism 9/11 happen that terrorism attack set off a thing called the NSA the NSA now has total control of every National Security Alliance or whatever the Association or whatever it is so it's a national security thing everybody's under that and if you come out from under the norm you're considered a terrorist now what is the norm if you go into a religious realm the norm is every religion I don't care what it is every religion believes there's a Trinity they believe in water baptism the name Father Son Holy Ghost well they're sprinkling or poor and it's still basic you see all those basic doctrines we'll see we're not under that we've already been pulled out and put into another group because we are not normal accepted religion so being not accepted normal religion that means we are radical so we've been put over in the corner somewhere and you know what's gonna happen one day one day something's gonna happen and they're gonna ha notice but you know what there's nothing you can do to stop it it's already been foretold brother Rams already told us what was going to happen with money and with the Catholic Church and with everybody going under one system we know that's going to happen we're Darla's service a democrat or republican regardless of what people pass laws it doesn't matter but if you've got the Holy Ghost today you have missed the tribulation period you have missed the wrath of God poured out where everybody in the world Kings don't you think a king of Saudi Arabia could pay a billion dollars and have a whole army around him to keep somebody or get him doesn't matter because they're under the wrath of God they're not under the wrath of man this is God pouring out wrath on them now we know it's through man but we know the sixth seal though is the judgment seal so that judgment seal of the word is the sixth seal when it opens to you to me when it opens that tells you you've already been judged you've already been redeemed you've all your judgment is over because listen if not you've got to be judged by your works and being judged by your works you just might not make it but I'm judged by Jesus Christ works and if he made it I'm gonna make it hey man so that's the way I see this six he'll open is that I have put everything upon him he took my tribulation he took my persecution he took all these things at Calvary so that I don't have to so the sixth seal is the judgment seal of the entire Word of God when that 6dl opens in its natural form the whole world's going to be involved we just read it the whole world this is not just persecution on Israel and persecution on Germany and persecution in the United States sure we know the prophet of God said it starts here and works its way over there because listen we are the country that turned the Prophet down first we had a prophet come right out of our nation our own language and like I told you before we sent all them silly doctrines all over the world come right out of the United States the doctrines in the Philippines and then Jamaica in different places where we've been and know for sure where they come from and who took them over there they came from the United States so we're going get it first we're gonna get judgment first because we turned down the prophet of God in 1956 he said this that's a long time ago 1956 most people in this building weren't born yet some of you work like Terran said some you old ones real oh what'd you say that now I gotta tell them oh people it's open you know how look at you you're not old you're just heading toward a body change that's the way I see it so the sixth seal now let's let's skip this and go to number can't pull up number three who's back there today Anderson back there look okay good alright that's okay so well we'll let them get their dibs number three Anderson I said back there you went that means the little kids that means a little kids are back there they're not little kids they're grown me and they're growing up man that looked good to all them good good looking kid we got a bunch of good-looking kids you brought your mamas and daddies bearbie start praying baby praying long and hard amen yeah mm-hmm yeah so let's go to this and see we've already read this one time we're gonna read it again now we find out also the sixth seal now being opened it was for a three-fold purpose now here was the purposes the first thing was that the sleeping virgin had to go through the tribulation now his brother Dale was talking about all in all remember one thing eternal life is eternal life but there are degrees of eternal life you and I receive eternal life here because we are newborn babes so you might say we are we were born wrong and then we got born again God filled our soul with eternal life while we are living and breathing on the face of the earth okay that's one group now the foolish virgin is going to be given eternal life but there are another group it's going to be imparted to them at the white throne judgment everybody got that same man oh you that are awake the first thing was asleep but now what do they have to do they got to go through a persecution of their own of their own they got to go to a persecution be killed for what they believe and then given eternal life at the white room for their stand for the gospel that they understand while they're here yes that's almost a direct quote from brother Branham cuz a sleeping virgin they are virgins but they were not taught look the first thing was the sleeping virgins had to go through the tribulation period for purification you and I I hope if we'll understand this will come to that body change we'll come to the right our purifications already here everything we need and everything we got in the new birth has already took care of all that she had to be purged for her sins of unbelief and rejecting the message this she was done in the tribulation period we see they wind up over in revelation 7 between the 6th and 7th chapter that she has been purged and she's been giving her robes now she's not the bride she's the church she will be imparted eternal life she didn't possess it she will be given eternal life at the white zone judgment all right but the bride we already have it here man to receive have an opportunity to receive the message or in some way they were blinded by false prophets we see that going on now and they didn't get a chance and yet they're really sincere and hard and God knows they're hard and here they're purged during this time now that's the first purging the second purging you'll notice another purging time that's for Israel when she gathers now look Israel remember I went through all that in the fifth seal Israel was jeet was God's first bride Israel was God's first bride she went whoring against other idols and other gods and God had what she tried to fool around with another man God had to put her away and give her a billing of divorcement divorced her and married the bride the man you can do that remember in marriage and divorce hello if you catch your wife riding around on some bye on you you can put her away marry somebody else and she's just she's not gonna ever be restored back coach can't take her back you can't take her back because she's polluted we went through all that during the fifth seal because what happened was Israel turn Christ's down at the cross so that put that 144,000 they're gonna get eternal life but they're gonna be in another position not bright anymore he can't marry her again he gave Mary as his divorced wife again you can't do that said even says in the Bible you can't do that in a natural sense so God surely couldn't do it in a spiritual sense so he sends Israel through the Tribulation Period twelve thousand out of each tribe 12 tribes 144,000 see out of the millions that will gather there's not just all Israel there will be a selected 144,000 and they will be purged what they'll be persecuted they'll be killed along with the two prophets they'll be killed then that what they will be caught up and then Armageddon begins all right and then notice there's a whole earth to be purged there will be such a thing that the moon stars and all nature will be purged you see what it is the earth is renewing herself being purged getting ready for the Millennium the millenniums coming up and see everything that's got any filth in it is to be purged during the sixth seal all right everybody got that say man all right that would be at the Battle of Armageddon going into the millennium where everything is going to be cleaned off so that us and Christ can come back to the earth but there's got some things happen before that so let's go to number four we read it last Sunday and we're talking about and I want to I want to stop for just a second on this but let's read it first brother Branham in 1964 she long service to Arizona I read this last Sunday we all know that's the identification we know what the third pull is cuz everybody's worried about what the third pull it we all we all understand that now you got you'll have to take you'll have the tape see and I think it'll just lay dormant for a little while until the great hour of persecution you and I are not being persecuted at the moment like that kind of persecution then when it be it'll speak it'll manifest just like the five straight signs remember brother Brown one two five straight times perfectly now think just wait and see what it done and I'm going he's in other words he's going back out find out way back out to Jefferson billing things what he's talking about so the third pull then lays dormant now watch number five blow up number five ninety once at the end time I noticed the very day when this message no this is right after he preached that watch not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message now we know for sure brother branham's message was the opening of the seven seals not to healing campaign not to not the signs in the hand and all that it was the opening of those seven seals that no man had ever looked on except brother branham Christ preached them and brother Branham brought them to our attention that's what we're trying to see now we're not trying to see just that the wild horse rider was the Antichrist no there's a lot more to that that was the seal that broke when that seal broke that was more for us to understand if not what they would have took a rapture in 1963 right all right so now not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message see first pull healing second pull prophesying third pull opening of the word the mysteries revealed no more there's no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets now what did brother Brown say previous to that that the the third pull would lay dormant now that doesn't mean two words laying dormant the words in action it's when the third pull is needed which is what the speaking of the word what happened under the third pull of brother rounds ministry he spoke the word and something happened no squirrels there were squirrels no salvation there was salvation storm now there's no storm sister Mita had the thing on her side those different things you understand what I'm saying so you and I have come to a place that even we've got to come to this third pool ministry part before the rapture can take place because the third pull is the opening of the word the mysteries revealed no more higher order to reveal the word than profits so we've had the profit here now we've got the profit - Holy Ghost the only way the profit can be vindicated is by the word and remember the third pole with the opening of them seven seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word do you see it the congregation says Amen but you got to remember their brother Branham told that same group of people that's jeffersonville's two years after he preached the seals that they went for them they wasn't getting it in other words it was sealed right back up it was sealed back up and it laid dormant until now until today you and I today because you and I remember I preached a long time we're going I think Bob kind of pulled on it a little bit the other name how much the three poles of our journey you and I must have three poles you and I must go through the sword in the hand and all these different things brother Branham was a type showing the bride had to come to these things not one man brother Branham coming got he was the first-fruit a man he was the one that first received it but he didn't keep it he give it to the bride you and I have it now hey man you and I have the full opening of the word now he didn't take it with him he's got to come back and bring it to us hello you and I are recipients of this the opening of the words for the first ball well first pool is healing that types what justification God heals you at justification amen he did me you know what he healed me from all that sin I did in the past amen that'll never come back anymore that's permanent that was true justification he justified me the first pull and you know what it's not a push it's a pull he's pulling you into these things you're not you're you know that's our problem sometimes we push ourselves into stuff remember brother Bram said you didn't seek God God sought you he pulled you Paul he pulls you into justification he pulls you into sanctification second Paul prophesying you get to understand more of the Word of God even brother Branham says your name is put on the book as a believer in sanctification and then so you're walking through and you are looking at you say what's prophesy men prophesying is I read and see what brother branham's taught said about me I look and see what God's already said about me that's that's them prophesying about me when you read the Bible it should be talking to you about you this message should be as we read the message brother Branham wasn't talking to that group of people he had in front of it was talking to me and you because you and I are the recipients the finality of all this coming together the third pull the opening the word which is the opening of the seven seals we believe this in time it has happened in this time our time but it took a prophet to bring us the word but when he broke broke the word to us he didn't take you back with him he gave it out to us thank God for God sending a prophet but think of that look through your journey what does three mean three is what perfection you are perfected in threes brother Brian was ministry was perfected in threes because the first pull was healing he went right on through that had a bunch of carnal / impersonators a lot of people did the same thing he did but they didn't have a message then you come to second pull prophesying here we go brother Branham prophesied telling us of all these things that's going to happen but when he come to that third Pole that he said that was the greatest realm I ever worked in more healing than even Jesus Christ yet he said the opening of the word was the greatest an Ordnung he'd ever worked under so you and I must see it's the greatest anointing that we have worker there is the opening of the word so that the mysteries can be revealed then I told you last Sunday or Sunday before left there's only one mystery is that God can hide himself in you that's only one mystery left is Satan cannot believe that you say who you say you are and he's going to make you prove it to me that's the great mystery whatever what other mystery is there if Christ was the Seventh Seal he was a total mystery to the world total mystery he hung on Calvary by itself nobody understood who he was so you think we're gonna have a big crowd hanging around us no no not when we do like I said when we get to where we say I and my father won and these other things the Shutts gonna pull away people are not gonna be able to swallow that especially the denominational world cuz they're going to do just like they did Jesus they're gonna say you a man making yourself God no it's God has made itself into me and you not a second person not another person the same person almighty garden human flesh called a bride amen alright let's go to number six and be alright with that so you how you put yourself in the journey in the three pools is God pulling you through God's pulling you up the statue of a perfect man he's pulling you to a body change and that's gonna pull the dead Saints on the ground I don't know what people's looking for I don't I I'm not searching for what other people are searching for this code word or this prophet to come back or this I thought Moses even said that we go look for Christ over here we go look for him over hundred and he said he's neither even in thy mouth the word of faith that you preach so where are we looking for God out that's what we're looking for look at we're looking for some great something to get us emotionally stirred up when Jesus was hanging on Calvary he was not emotionally stirred up he was dying but he was dying for me and you amen all right that Easter proved it he wasn't only the word he was God himself the dynamics in the word that made the body of Jesus Christ cold stiff and dead in the grave shake into life and rise again and roll away the stone I am he that was dead so dead till the son said he was dead the moon said he was dead the star said he was dead all nature said he was dead and now the whole world has to recognize that he's alive again how is that in me and you there's no other way for them to realize it he was not only the mechanics God's Word he was the dynamics to prove it and as he being the groom the bride has to come forth cuz it's part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all look the bride the bride the bride it is the bride and the bride can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others have spoke of the bride it's the bride that will have to be manifested in the end time if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride so listen all these people that are leaving the message and all these people are preaching false doctrine leave him alone leave him alone if they are not preaching the word leave him alone because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone no I'm sorry let's go but if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is like him because if she is like him she's the devil if she's like him do you understand what I'm saying if she is like him she is the devil she is him as man and woman are one and woman taken from his side she had taken a spirit the feminist spirit from him the flesh from his side made both mechanics and dynamics the wife listen as we said before when Eve appeared before Adam she was the same person he was except for the feminist part inside her flesh was his flesh her bone was his bone her blood was his blood we got to be the same way the spirit of him and the flesh of him and put it together and made mechanics and dynamics until that church becomes both dynamics and mechanics and the Spirit of God that moved him to do the things he did if he hit on 16 cylinders so will the bride for he said in John 14 12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also I'll give him a charge of my dynamics in his mechanics excuse me that the world will not be able to withstand it there's your third pole the world will not be able to stand in front of you and me if we have what we say we're supposed to have coming up to the end to the persecution part listen it's gonna take a miracle for somebody to stand here and take a body change and not be killed an absolute miracle I'll give him a charge of my dynamics and I'll raise him up again to the last day that's the Easter message the dynamics everybody know the mechanics is what the word the dynamics is them as the word is the firing of the word the mechanics without the dynamics no good you have the car with the with the motor but no gas it's worthless neither is the dynamics without the mechanics you can scream shout and jump up and down all you want to and deny this word it won't do you any good you're just cranking around the Pistons got the spark there to fire but no gasoline to fire it by it only works as they come together comes together one will sit still the other will go up that's the only thing there is to it yet they both might look like we know what he's talking about the church nominal and the church spiritual look yet they might look alike both claim to be churches both claim to be bright but one has mechanics and dynamics it brings it to pass of what he said it's the truth it just won't move no matter how good the mechanic says until the dynamics come when the dynamics come that fire is made to connect with that octane in the gasoline and then that explodes it causes the combustion and that combustion moves every motion ever move freeze the same yesterday today and forever that is the resurrection that is the resurrection all right let's go to the next one number seven it's the rising of the Sun this is paragraph 168 that's the divine revelation of the word made flesh if it was flesh in that day by the Sun the groom it's the flesh today by the bride whosoever sins you remit to them they are remitted whosoever sins you retain to them they are retained now the Catholic Church picked that up and takes it to the priest but that's carnal watch it was the spiritual revealed word that did it and that's what's gonna do it for you and I the spiritually revealed word not just quotes not just being able to quote being able to being the spiritually revealed word that did it so now if you can see that can you see this next scripture though the next go to the next color scripture and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory now wall now hold now my brother listen Jesus they glorified them with the same glory that I was glorified with in John st. John 17 you and I are the glory brother Brown said we are the victory the bride is the victory of Christ without us his work was not fulfilled without us the word has to be made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the Father now listen we know this has not begotten of the father but what's inside of you is if it's not you are second person and you are the devil you were begotten by the father you are born again full of grace and truth that's you if it spiritually revealed that's you all right if it spiritually revealed you have no problem with saying I am the Word made flesh now have we come to that so let's read again number eight he's not Arab with a shock then Along Came sanctification how many believes in sanctification you believe the Bible you have to sure so still that's not it's a little more like there's two more words but then come the Pentecost the restoration of the gift speaking in tongues they call it the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost peeking in tongues there they call that the initial evidence which brought forth to what the shuk but they denominated but when you come to say I and my father are one and these other things then the ship pulls away from it some will not be able to stand what we're preaching I don't mean just we in this church I mean we as the brighter coming to a place that if we don't start saying I my father one we're gonna be saying he looks good in a cast it I'm just telling you the truth we must see this and it must come in a quickening form that's why somebody's got to start preaching it somebody's got to start getting the people to believe who they already are I'm my father 1 and these other things then the shut pulls away why the shook ain't the shucks ain't the wheat the shucks the covering it at one time it had life in it God come through the stock God come through I mean come through the two ears he comes through the stop God come through the shucks now he's in the wheat that's what he's into now he's not into the stock stocks dried up already gone he had life in it at one time Luther it had life into it Wesley had life into it Pentecost but once you come back to the genuine wine the real genuine wine bride church will bring forth the entire Word of God in its fullness in its strength for he's the same yesterday today and forever I'm just telling you what he's already saying about us then alright but when you come to say he didn't say when I told myself he said when you come to say I and my father of one and these other things listen you got to start confessing it before it's a possession confession leads to profoundly profession leads to possession but the real genuine Brian Church will bring forth the entire Word of God in its fullness and in its strength for he's the same yesterday today and forever can you stand it John 14 17 and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive all right guys the world can't receive this German talking gate I think what's happening now is birthday cake Germans out the gate birthday cake some kind of cake thank you even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive listen the world can't speak our language they can't even live wait and listen and it's not that we're hearing their hear God's made us this way God's equipped us with what we need to do something that no one else in the world even Jesus Christ Himself did not he had to die but he died for you so that you don't have to but somebody's gonna stand on this earth and say death you don't even have a stinger anymore whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not seeing it does not understand neither knoweth him listen folks most and I heard a preacher the other day and he did a really good job most people live off of historical Jesus Christ the historical God God did something at Calvary for me but they can't get him off the cross they keep him back there 2,000 years and you know what in their position maybe that's all they can see and listen Jesus said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved but you got to believe that he come inside of you not that he's still hanging on that cross listen it's not a historical God it's an I am ever-present God that's what the Prophet brought us he tried that he tried to tell him people that God was right there with him there was not a historical God even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it see if they understand us him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I personal pronoun will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world understandeth me no more but you understand me and my change in the Bible no but you understand me good listen we're not we can't physically see Christ but we know he's inside of us right but ye understand him because I live you shall live also that day the prophet said this day you shall know it doesn't say you will guess or you might he says you shall know that I am you ever heard that before I am in my father and ye in me and I in you now most of the people can see but look what's what - look watch what the Trinitarian doctrine does it can't see him in the Father because they see two people and then I and you as the Holy Ghost that's another person but all I see right there is a spiritual union of one person one person I am in my father and ye and me that's the problem because it takes you into me but now remember you and I the first bride came out of item the second bride has to go back in hello we came out of his side at Calvary but we got to go back into his side because ye and me and I knew that's one person I and my father one and these other things there's a three-fold manner here just like it was in the three poles trees is perfection I and my father yeah and me and I knew it's a journey we know that when the Holy Ghost comes inside of you that makes you Almighty in human flesh but can we see you and cost being the same person that's hard to believe but I'm just telling you what he said I'm in my father you're in me and I in you we are one I came from God I'd go back to God amen all right let's read nine and ten and then we'll start in communion here you him nineteen sixty now you see Jesus had proven to God that he'd been the right kind of son see this no all right this is our journey and then next Sunday we'll talk a little bit more about into the journey because we we have to go through a journey this is not just all of a sudden we're gonna just jump right in and be manifested sons of God no we got to come to that all right we got a journey to go through all right like we were talking last night and get this listen we have to have faith we have to believe but that's the vehicle now look I don't have to believe and have faith that I'm in church today because in my journey I'm gonna believe my car's gonna get me the church I'm gonna believe I'm gonna get up in the morning and I believe that my clothes are gonna be ready to go and I knew that Jim don't so it's my fault funnel dress right so I come to church and then I say I believe I'm gonna go to church today now I'm already here faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen I didn't see myself for church but I had faith that I was coming here but that faith ended when I got to church your faith ends when you see your God when you see your God your faith is over it is finished now listen we believe to healing that's only temporary you can die the same thing two weeks ago and have supernatural faith to believe God can heal you cancer and two weeks later die cancer that's not what I'm talking about I'm told that when we realize who we are and what we're doing here Satan will not be able to bring that death ticket and put it in our face he closed them in immortality we'll talk about that a little more next time mm-hmm because really faith is the journey believing is journey I don't listen I have to have faith there's a future home but now I shouldn't because I'm taking it with me this is my future home according to brother Branham according to the Bible John saw it coming out of heaven as a bride adorned for her husband why's a bride always gotta be attached to this does this mean you you have your home and your street number already where you sitting right now because the city won't be complete without you God is not complete without you if you ever heard that before he clothed him in mortality remember this is Matthew 17 when he took him on the mountain but now remember see that was temporary Oh be careful that was temporary he didn't Jesus didn't become immortal on that mountain no he died at Calvary about six months later but it was showing that you and I can come to that because the first son's already come to it potentially he didn't become immortal till the day of Easter morning when he said all power in him and there's been getting under me that was a mortal that had become immortal but God shows us these things in our journey to keep us what pulling he keeps pulling us to our destination but we must confess to possess Amen His garment shine like the Sun watch a supernatural son thing taking place his garments glistened like the Sun in the middle of the day it's white as they could be God placed on him that robe of immortality showing that he had received him read that next sentence that's the thing that God will do to his sons here on earth some day huh you believe God sent a prophet you believe the prophets right you believe prophets talking to you about you right there is what he said God will do to his sons here on earth someday he will call you a side Church if you'll only obey Him and stay on the word and believe it he will place into the church before the coming of Jesus Christ he will place into the church all the powers hello's them by all the powers that Christ had in him will be in the church all that God was he poured into Jesus all the Jesus what he poured into the church God wanting his working done he sent it into his son the son warning the work done sent it into the church and that day you'll know that I am the father father me and I in you and you and me at that day because the same power of God was in Jehovah God rested in Jesus Christ the same power that rested in Jesus Christ rest into place sons and the body of Christ placing up a son take him out in a certain place have a ceremony before angels place him positionally what is he isn't what he is in the body of Christ then that person has the authority let me say this if you count me a fanatic from this night on that very same thing that I'm speaking of will be done and hold on it just didn't say him there'll be a power putting to the bride and now is coming in that the holy spirit will so anoint the people till they'll speak the word and it'll create itself right there we haven't seen powers lights coming into the church now I know it for a fact saying to this mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart but believe what you've said shall come to pass it can have you can have what you've said the placing of the church in position where the fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost comes into the church then critics mouth what the shuck will be shut up it'll be a short time you hear me it'll be a short time well the ramps gonna be a short time Jesus came right off the mountain went straight to Calvary notice it won't last long but it'll be here that's your prophet talking about you one more name will finish the Uniting time ensign 1963 right after the seal to preach What did he say Malachi 4 would restore restore back the original Pentecostal faith back to the people with the same Pentecostal message the same Pentecostal sign the same Pentecostal evidence the same God the same power the same teaching everything is actually with the vindication of the same pillar fire they've struck Paul down on the road down to Damascus amongst us today doing the same thing he did in that day uniting we see the nation's you 90s that's what we're all worried about go well this is doing this and this we're doing them what about us what about our uniting time we see the churches uniting we see the bride uniting uniting with the word why the word is God and as the word as the bridegroom being the word and the bride being the Hemmer of the word they come together in a union they unite like a wedding see they're getting ready for a wedding and they become one the word becomes u-haul wait a minute brother branham the word becomes you and you become the word john 1:14 and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us I'm telling you what the Prophet said about you as the bridegroom being the word and the bride being the hear of the word they come together in the union they unite like a wedding see they're getting ready for a wedding and they become one the word becomes you and you become the word jesus said that that day you know what all the father is I am all that I am you are and all you are I am in that day you'll know that I'm in the father the father and me I and you and you and me see at that day what day this day we find out the great hidden mysteries now what's the hidden mystery I and you and you and me that's the hidden mystery the hidden mystery is is that where God made manifest look we're not just a bride we have that title sure but I thought he said we were having the Uniting time where the two come together to make what one we find out the great hidden mysteries of God being revealed oh how I like that he and George what he was saying amen you enjoy what you enjoy what he's saying about you that's what he said he said I in you and you and me all I am you are and all you are I am he turned that thing around and he's looking right at us and he said what I am you are and what you are I am so Jesus Christ does not have a problem with saying who you are because you're him you're him you're him made manifest in another form called a bride that's what to me the sixth seal shows me that I am so sanctified I remember the fifth seal we talked as justification the highest form the real you didn't do it because the fifth seal Jew he can't see their sin the real Jew didn't the real person didn't do that or he would couldn't give him eternal life he given me eternal life because he blinded their eyes right now we come to the sixth and we see a toll of distress and of nature we see that he so cleans the earth off until he can walk on it he can walk on the earth after the sixth seal naturally opens Christ the seventh seal can appear on the earth with his bride he's not by itself he's got somebody with him he's got his complete bride body with him during that time so what does the sixth seal sure it's the tribulation seal sure it's the the seal that that's a horrible seal to the world but if you're sealed into Christ it's not horrible for you it's the greatest part of you that you're so sanctified that God sees his self in you he sees himself in you not as another person but as the person of Jesus Christ on the earth called the bride can you swallow that list and I'm not gonna actually can you swallow it I'm asked can you make it manifest because we got to that's our mandate our mandate is to be Jesus Christ on this earth because he said I am the resurrection in the life you and I must come to that before the dead because remember what brother Brown say he said now Christ comes up to the tomb of Lazarus if he would have said dead come forth he said everybody would have resurrected he said he said Lazarus come forth and Lazarus came forth but now you and I got a lot of dead friends in the ground seven whole church ages of people in the ground that you and I have got to come to a place to where you can say I am the resurrection all we swallowed the I am only struck what about I am the resurrection I am now as I am is you're not I am but when he connects with you can you separate them that's our problem what we do is is we try to start separating God's trying to pull us back in and we're trying to push ourselves by how we know humanly none of us are worthy but if you'll just listen to what God said God said we were worthy God told us if we had the Holy Ghost and we live by the word that he would do the same thing to us that he did to Jesus Christ Romans 8 says we're heirs and joint heirs with Christ whatever he gets we get not in a lesser form but not in not in one person but in a mini membered body you and I are Jesus Christ made manifest on the earth let's borrow it here gentlemen I love the Lord we thank you for this day we pray that what we said Lord has been pleasing and the people will as we looked at in Revelations that John took the book and ate the book and it was sure sweet in his mouth but it was bitter in his stomach he had to go out and live what was in that book I pray father that you that the people here Lord today when I just live the book but become the book because we are you made manifest in another form called the bride we're just trying to tell the people exactly what you've already said but you had to send us a prophet to help us believe in this journey there was all those different scruples and different roads and different denominations and different Creed's and all but you sent us a prophet thank God that we could sit down and listen to what he said and listened what he said about us he said we are the virtuous sinless we'll talk about next Sunday the virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ we're just saying what you say Lord we ask that you just forgive us of our sins Lord in our minim of states Lord as we'll go forward to this communion time a solemn time Lord to take this cup and and this little weight a little bit of unleavened bread Lord we pray that you would just be with us and bless us Lord for being sick among us we've seen people healed completely healed from just taking communion Lord we pray that you just bless each one father bless us in our journey I believe we're beginning to understand what we're doing here and we're understanding a little bit more of what you've already said about us not some great new revelation but Lord just being regarded being revealed in human flesh called a bride bless us all Lord take care of us your brother Louie send him on the trip back they got along Oh Lord give him refreshment for Wednesday night so he can come in and give us Lord the words of eternal life father just bless us take care of says return the service older brother to hell and Jesus name we pray amen god bless you you need prayer we'll do it while we're doing the communion because I have seen people heal we've seen people healed taking communion because you know what you're doing you're doing what God said if you do what God said he will bless you he'll have to because he said he would all right god bless you hey man the bride says Amen let's give her her brother again you know when we begin to say and believe I believe we're told me that life's not well Ryan asked a question about the word believing it starts off believing believing believing believing believing you know after a while it kind of turns out to be his believe it it's not you believing is he is believing that's what it'll it'll come forth in the correct way and be fully made manifest right amen still a brother how much you appreciate the message cuz we believe it we appreciate all of the things that you gave us today for a birthday and thank you for the for the food the things that we had and all it was a great great time a great enjoyment now there will be another on the 16th those today is not my birthday just joking just joking all right we appreciate everything all right let's just pray and go right into the service have the communion of foot washing father we thank you for this day in your grace we thank you for the message that we've heard today and we pray that you would just help us to understand who we are and what we're doing here we're here for a purpose we're not here just by accident or some haphazard thing happening we're here to fulfill your word and we love you and we think you just have your way got us Lord help thou our unbelief Lord make it to where unbelief will become your believing and then we can be into a reality of knowing who endured we are and what's going on we love you and we thank you in Jesus name
