[6:19] amen God bless you camp was great for
[6:23] the kids and I enjoyed being there I
[6:26] attended the kids Tabernacle cuz they
[6:28] have two for the under 13 and for the
[6:30] older ones and actually they have for
[6:32] the Youth too and brother Trevor did the
[6:35] youth and the other brothers did the big
[6:37] one and I took the kids to the kids
[6:40] Tabernacle and it was interesting there
[6:43] because they like demonstration you know
[6:45] preaching with demonstration and it was
[6:47] wonderful uh the one that stood out for
[6:50] me was brother John Sanger I may say
[6:52] their name wrong he's from Pennsylvania
[6:55] so he had planned all these Salmons for
[6:57] the kids and he took the
[7:00] morning morning service I believe
[7:02] morning
[7:03] services and so he taught them Bible
[7:06] scripture Sarah can remember all of them
[7:09] and one of the services he brought a
[7:11] plow you know we're supposed you know if
[7:13] Sarah could say the Bible verse I forgot
[7:15] you know no one is the one who looks
[7:17] back when plowing is not fit for the
[7:19] Kingdom so he brought that and so what
[7:23] okay that that was one the one that
[7:25] stood out for me was he taught them the
[7:28] devil being a scammer
[7:30] how the Devil is a scam cu the brother
[7:31] actually was scammed his identity was
[7:33] stolen for the singer yeah he's a pastor
[7:36] and so through all that he came up with
[7:38] that sermon and he had uh a real a real
[7:44] person that was part of the sermon and a
[7:47] fake um scarecrow so he had real fake
[7:50] real fake different things and when it
[7:54] came to the fake owl you know the devil
[7:58] being the fake owl he didn't have a real
[8:00] bird and he didn't know how to catch a
[8:02] bird how do you catch a bird and bring
[8:04] it so so keep that aside
[8:09] now there's this couple from Guyana
[8:12] who've been coming to that camp since
[8:14] they started I believe 40 something
[8:16] years just coming to clean the bathrooms
[8:20] clean you know whatever cleaning pick up
[8:22] trash just a black couple from Guyana
[8:24] they're old now and this year they
[8:26] called brother um the one who organizes
[8:29] brother the Doug and told Brother Doug
[8:31] brother Doug it looks like we won't be
[8:33] able to come this
[8:34] year uh why would you come uh the lady
[8:37] who keeps her parrot is not able to keep
[8:40] the parrot this
[8:43] year so well brother brother dck says um
[8:48] so they're in New York so brother uh
[8:50] brother Dak asks them is the parrot a
[8:54] Christian cuz the camp is for Christians
[8:57] uh he says well sister the wife wife
[8:59] preaches to Ruth her name is Ruth the
[9:02] the the parent she preaches to it I
[9:06] guess it's a
[9:08] Christian so brother Doug says well
[9:10] we've never had a bird just bring it in
[9:12] a cage what do we do we need you so they
[9:15] come and the guy who was driving them
[9:17] had to call the state to confirm that
[9:19] they can drive a bird through state
[9:21] lines which is a big thing but they
[9:23] finally made it
[9:26] so now time to preach for brother Doug
[9:30] then he he has as a
[9:33] parrot you know he has as a parrot and
[9:35] he didn't have that so I like wow look

[22:51] to me a man of wisdom abely and the way
[22:54] God deals with him through the word and
[22:56] his thoughts are wonderful to me
[22:59] uh they really do help me I get lots of
[23:02] uh notes uh maybe they're not directly
[23:05] from there but uh just just wonderful
[23:09] and he said that he was uh kind of
[23:11] scattering it out and of course I
[23:13] immediately I thought of the Waffle
[23:16] House I didn't say anything but
[23:19] immediately I thought of the waffle he
[23:20] said salad and I said no scattered
[23:23] smothered covered whatever that phrase
[23:24] is he had it all going on Amen
[23:29] I really enjoyed it so then he mentioned
[23:32] and brother Wade said something about
[23:34] meat well I told my wife earlier today I
[23:36] said I'm going to tell the folks that
[23:38] I'm going to be bringing them
[23:40] dessert we're but we're not bypassing
[23:43] the main course I'll tell you why have
[23:45] you ever had minced meat
[23:47] pie well I grew up on
[23:50] it yeah I know it sounds
[23:54] terrible but the minc meat pie that my
[23:56] grandmother grew up on was minced meat
[24:00] right all right we're not going to mince
[24:02] any words with you that's right I can
[24:04] tell you that right now but the mince
[24:07] meat pie that I grew up on was made out
[24:09] of different things like pecans and
[24:12] raisins to imitate yeah mince meat and
[24:16] you know if you know me at all you know
[24:18] that I like anything sweet amen that's
[24:21] why I love my
[24:25] wife thought I'd get that in there
[24:31] everybody
[24:33] comfortable all right I'm going to take
[24:35] you up to the Natural Food
[24:37] okay now I give the title of the message
[24:40] I've been preaching at home and I feel
[24:41] like I'm at home you're just an
[24:43] extension of the family of God around
[24:45] the world and and uh I I've been
[24:48] preaching on war amen we are at War amen
[24:52] you may not want to be at War and you
[24:55] may not realize that we're at War but we
[24:58] we are at War whether we like it or not
[25:01] and let me tell you something about the
[25:03] bride of Christ she likes it amen she
[25:07] likes it because she knows that God
[25:09] ordained her to do a job and that job
[25:13] requires a battle amen so this may seem
[25:18] like a strange scripture to read but I
[25:20] want you to turn to psalms
[25:24] 27 yeah okay does doesn't that seem like
[25:27] a strange scripture
[25:29] to and you all know me I'm I'm learn the
[25:34] I'm learning gadgets but I'm not that
[25:36] good at him okay but I'll get the hang
[25:39] of it you just give me a
[25:41] minute I'll get the hang of it I'm going
[25:44] to do my best to stay in line with the
[25:47] thoughts that God has given me psalms
[25:51] 27 all
[25:53] right better find it myself got it right
[25:56] here how many knows where this scripture
[26:00] is found in the message the
[26:03] Rapture seems like an odd scripture uh
[26:06] for me when I first listened to the
[26:08] message Rapture many years ago I said I
[26:10] wonder why he's reading that scripture
[26:12] why ain't he reading Thessalonians or
[26:14] why why ain't he reading uh 1
[26:16] Corinthians 15 why wh wh what what what
[26:19] what is the why not Revelations
[26:21] 4:1 psalms 27
[26:28] whether he knew it or not God knew
[26:31] something you ready amen the Lord is my
[26:35] light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear
[26:38] amen all right the Lord is the strength
[26:42] of my
[26:43] life of whom shall I be
[26:46] afraid when the wicked even mine enemies
[26:49] and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my
[26:53] flesh they stumbled and fail all right
[26:57] we're at War you know amen though an
[27:00] host should encamp against
[27:03] me my heart shall not fear though War
[27:07] yes see should rise against me in this
[27:11] will I be
[27:12] confident one thing have I desired of
[27:15] the Lord that will I seek after that I
[27:19] may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[27:22] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[27:25] of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple
[27:28] for in the time of trouble he shall hide
[27:31] me in his Pavilion in the secret of his
[27:33] Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set
[27:36] me up on a rock let's pray
[27:40] father now father many years later it's
[27:43] been revealed to me father and to your
[27:46] children why this portion of scripture
[27:49] father makes perfect sense makes perfect
[27:52] sense to me Father for the oncoming
[27:56] Rapture that we are anticipating Lord
[27:59] because we're finding out in these
[28:00] scriptures that there is a hiding
[28:03] place but it does not produce
[28:06] fear it produces
[28:09] confidence and we know that the enemy is
[28:12] not going to relent he's not going to
[28:14] relinquish he's he's not going to back
[28:17] up Lord we even know so much about the
[28:20] enemy that he thought he had you when
[28:22] you showed up down there in hell but you
[28:26] showed up there for a different reason
[28:27] father he didn't have you
[28:29] yeah you wanted them keys back yeah and
[28:33] you got them now Lord I pray tonight
[28:36] that you'd give us at least one of those
[28:38] keys which is Faith Amen to believe
[28:41] every word Lord amen we know father that
[28:45] without believing every word we'll never
[28:48] have the token n we'll never be able to
[28:51] enter into this Pavilion father because
[28:53] the token is required amen help us each
[28:55] and every one father I pray bless your
[28:57] children in their efforts here father
[29:00] for standing
[29:02] firm those that are on the stream or the
[29:04] hookup Lord bless them Father help them
[29:08] I pray because our desire father is not
[29:10] to be seen or heard but it's to present
[29:13] your word father in such a
[29:16] way where it'll turn on the
[29:18] light cuz there is a man who can turn on
[29:21] the light father we're thankful for him
[29:23] amen we're thankful for you let it be
[29:26] for your honor and your glory father we
[29:28] pray in Jesus Christ's name amen God
[29:31] bless you may be seated I'm so sorry for
[29:34] keeping you up but see I I I didn't even
[29:36] realize when I was first uh uh uh
[29:39] penciling this down and getting these
[29:40] thoughts and I've been preaching at home
[29:42] on the token and I've taken it uh to the
[29:44] place where brother Mike presented it to
[29:47] last night as as well as I've ever heard
[29:49] it presented and that is it's one thing
[29:51] to see the the signs wonders and
[29:53] miracles it's one thing to know the acts
[29:56] of God but it's another thing to have a
[29:58] personal relationship with God and today
[30:01] the token is the life of God and we
[30:06] realized that the blood that was applied
[30:08] back there uh in the days of of The
[30:13] Exodus was a sign yeah the token did
[30:16] have a meaning right um it it it but it
[30:20] was a representative meaning amen you
[30:22] understand that that blood that was
[30:24] applied to the doorpost and lentil uh of
[30:28] every home that that had a revelation to
[30:30] apply it um it it was a sign that a life
[30:34] had been
[30:35] given that's really what it meant that
[30:38] blood there was was a sign that a life
[30:41] had been given up and what that blood
[30:44] represented was the life in so much that
[30:47] it was the
[30:49] carrier of that life
[30:51] see now I got to thinking about
[30:55] carrier and I could preach on aircraft
[31:01] carriers but brothers and sisters do you
[31:03] realize that the day you and I live
[31:05] in as brother Mike said last night so
[31:08] eloquently is a dispensational change
[31:12] something is happening in order for us
[31:14] to make the
[31:15] Rapture there's going to have to be a
[31:18] change in the way we think the change in
[31:21] the way we The Way We Walk and the way
[31:23] we act and so forth and and and I and I
[31:26] and I realized something right away that
[31:28] the devil is is is is on is on the ropes
[31:32] we're in a fight we're in a war he's on
[31:34] the ropes but he is not going to give up
[31:40] all right I remember uh when I was a boy
[31:43] and by the way you don't know this but
[31:45] my middle name is
[31:48] clay and he's the Potter yes that's
[31:50] right amen but I wasn't named after a
[31:53] pot I was named after Cashes Clay it's
[31:57] my father father was a boxer okay and
[32:00] that was some of the Young Folks don't
[32:02] know who that is Mohammad
[32:05] Ali he he changed his name oh so there
[32:09] is a name change a name that's right huh
[32:12] people do it all the time down here on
[32:14] Earth right but a lot of people don't
[32:16] want to accept the fact that we're going
[32:18] to have to
[32:19] change something's got to happen amen
[32:23] now the reason why the devil's on the
[32:24] ropes is because he thinks that we're
[32:27] dopes yeah
[32:30] right that was the tactic of Muhammad
[32:33] Ali he was the fastest most powerful
[32:37] quickest boxer of his day yes but he was
[32:41] also the most
[32:42] intelligent amen and he beat most of his
[32:45] opponents before he ever got in the ring
[32:46] with them through psychology but we
[32:49] don't serve a god of psychology we serve
[32:52] a god of his word amen and we need to
[32:56] learn how to take God at his word in
[32:58] such a way where we
[33:01] are indefensible that's right amen I
[33:05] think that the prophet of God called us
[33:07] an invincible Army is that right and I
[33:11] believe that's what we represent today
[33:13] we are in a battle some of you right now
[33:16] are battling with would you tell that
[33:18] guy to get off of that
[33:20] platform I've heard enough yeah well
[33:24] come on on I mean it's we're all
[33:26] different yeah righten I'm not imputing
[33:28] you or demeaning me what I'm saying is
[33:31] human nature yes is always looking for
[33:34] the easy way
[33:36] out but that's not the God we serve amen
[33:40] there is a way out amen and that way out
[33:44] is through God's word amen and God's
[33:46] word is declared as we're going to find
[33:48] out that whether we like it or not we're
[33:52] in a war amen all right amen and the
[33:56] reason that the devil is so adamant
[34:00] about keeping us uh away from our
[34:04] responsibilities and
[34:06] duties is because he's had
[34:10] it once you and I come to the
[34:14] Revelation that we are what God is going
[34:17] to use to defeat the enemy at the last
[34:21] battle
[34:23] amen which by the way is the greatest
[34:25] battle ever fought that's right amen
[34:27] amen now the war the word War can I give
[34:31] it to you oh yeah a war is the entire
[34:35] conflict so from the beginning to the
[34:37] end where did this war start Revelations
[34:40] 12 tells us that Michael and his angels
[34:44] fought and Lucifer and his angels and
[34:47] Lucifer and his angels couldn't Prevail
[34:50] over Michael and his angels in heaven
[34:53] amen so God gave them a way of Escape y
[34:57] cast them down here to Earth and the war
[35:00] has been going on here ever since all
[35:04] right we all know that am okay so War
[35:08] the word War represents the entire
[35:10] conflict so think about this the younger
[35:12] people maybe World War I yeah there was
[35:16] many battles there was all kinds of
[35:18] Nations and ideas and Generals and
[35:20] soldiers and weaponry and so forth but
[35:23] the Bible tells you and me that there
[35:25] ain't a weapon formed no amen not one
[35:29] weapon formed amen that can Prevail
[35:32] against us right but God has given us
[35:36] the most powerful weapon there is and
[35:39] that's his word now brother brandom in
[35:42] one place I've got it here causing an
[35:44] atomic
[35:46] bomb that's how powerful the sharp
[35:49] two-edged sword of Hebrews 4:12 is it's
[35:54] got Atomic power in it and what Atomic
[35:59] power represents to you and me is the
[36:01] ability to change molecular
[36:07] structure huh like brother juel I love I
[36:10] love brother juel I wouldn't know you if
[36:13] it wasn't for brother
[36:14] juel
[36:16] right he's he he's he's as good a man to
[36:19] me as he's ever
[36:21] been I told him at The Breakfast Table a
[36:23] couple of day look brother
[36:25] juwel if if I if the Lord doesn't permit
[36:28] for you to get back to your former self
[36:32] you have
[36:33] already won the battle
[36:37] already now I'm not I'm not taking it
[36:40] away from the
[36:41] Lord he can be restored see you and I
[36:45] this battle that we're in is a battle
[36:47] such as this well he's he's old he's
[36:51] done his work he's he's had these health
[36:54] problems and I'm using everybody as an
[36:55] example now we got brother Barry edin
[36:58] down here in in Augusta Georgia and and
[37:00] he's 84 and and he's lived a long life
[37:03] and and and and and a lot of times I'm
[37:05] I'm I'm uh confessions good for the
[37:08] soul I'm telling you that that that that
[37:11] I would look at that picture say well
[37:12] he's lived a good life he served the
[37:15] Lord he's suffering so so it's it's time
[37:19] perhaps for him to go to be with the
[37:21] Lord right okay so so but there there's
[37:23] nothing wrong with that but it it's sort
[37:25] of the easy way out right
[37:29] why can't we
[37:31] believe when people are in those
[37:34] situations or
[37:35] conditions that God is more than willing
[37:40] and able to be able to bring them back
[37:44] to whatever condition he wants them to
[37:47] be in and be satisfied with that but we
[37:50] also serve a God in the Book of Judges
[37:53] chapter
[37:55] 7 who said Gideon I want you to go fight
[37:59] a battle for me and and here's a deal
[38:03] there's going to be so many of you and
[38:06] and and and and Israel's had so much
[38:08] success that that the people are going
[38:10] to begin to think it's
[38:12] them and not
[38:14] me talking about the Lord now so he told
[38:18] Gideon if you read it we just just just
[38:21] let me just go over it for a
[38:23] second he said I want you to go to
[38:25] battle
[38:27] and the Bible tells us there were
[38:30] 32,000
[38:31] people ready to go to battle it uses the
[38:34] word people yeah so that could be men
[38:37] women and
[38:38] children you know over in Israel you got
[38:41] to go you've got to go in the military
[38:44] that's right whether you like it or not
[38:47] because they need to defend themselves
[38:49] at all and every
[38:52] cost right now they're just a type we
[38:56] understand it's a natural type
[38:58] how many understands that brother
[38:59] Brenham said all scripture listen
[39:02] careful all
[39:05] scripture and all prophecy is compound
[39:09] yes those are the words of the prophet
[39:11] and I believe them amen compound yes
[39:14] that means one thing and of course
[39:16] brother Brandon would give us the
[39:17] example of I've called my son out of
[39:19] Egypt right you understand he used Moses
[39:22] and then he used Christ well we're in a
[39:25] Third Exodus amen sure we are amen all
[39:27] right don't don't discount the last one
[39:30] now okay and I I'm going to raise my
[39:33] hand and I'm going to tell you that I
[39:35] have fulfilled now the word compound
[39:38] means two or
[39:41] more you and I have fulfilled at least
[39:44] the compound of that scripture by being
[39:47] called out of Egypt amen Egypt to you
[39:51] and I is the world we were born in the
[39:55] condition we were born in we have been
[39:57] called out amen right right amen I
[40:01] believe you believe that yes amen but
[40:03] let me get into the meat amen of the
[40:07] fight the devil knows he only has so
[40:10] much time that's right so so he he had
[40:15] special Elite fighting forces that he's
[40:19] been training since the beginning of his
[40:22] time right and they are called the
[40:26] 200,000 th000 Horsemen from the river
[40:29] Euphrates they was let out in the
[40:31] natural
[40:32] Sense on Israel right but in the
[40:36] spiritual sense they was leted out on
[40:38] the bride now you'd say the church but
[40:41] what them 200,000,000 Horsemen are able
[40:44] to do is separate out the church from
[40:49] the bride right away because the church
[40:52] turns tail and runs amen but the bride
[40:56] of Christ
[40:58] stand she don't understand but she'll
[41:02] stand no matter what the cost amen now
[41:06] the God we serve wants to make sure that
[41:09] there is just the exact amount of people
[41:14] right amen left behind that are going to
[41:18] have the intestinal fortitude to take
[41:21] him at his word and realize that we're
[41:24] on the threshold of the Rapture but
[41:26] we're at War yes now I see why brother
[41:30] brandham read that scripture cuz God
[41:33] does have a safe house for us there's a
[41:35] safe place tomorrow I'm going to preach
[41:37] on God's infirmary yeah
[41:40] amen oh he's got one don't you remember
[41:43] the prophet of God saying wouldn't you
[41:45] have liked to look in Moses's bag to see
[41:49] what Moses had in there oh yeah you
[41:53] didn't know this but Abraham carried one
[41:56] too right right yeah his bag was full of
[41:59] Faith yeah amen and that's
[42:03] all you need yeah but it's got to be the
[42:07] Revelation the faith of Jesus Christ it
[42:10] can't be any other faith if you mix your
[42:15] own intelligence if you mix your own
[42:18] reason if you mix your own conscience if
[42:22] you mix anything of yourself in there
[42:25] it's polluted and it will fail yeah
[42:30] amen say well where are you going with
[42:32] this brother Chris we are in a battle
[42:36] yes now I'll keep reading but let me
[42:38] just preach
[42:40] amen the situation with you and I as we
[42:44] look at things like the greatest battle
[42:47] ever fought so remember now a battle is
[42:50] a
[42:51] conflict inside the war amen the war is
[42:55] the beginning and the end of this thing
[42:59] there are many conflicts and skirmishes
[43:02] inside the beginning and the end amen
[43:05] all right and we are in the greatest
[43:08] battle ever fought amen but here's the
[43:12] difference between the way we think and
[43:14] the way God thinks you and I since we
[43:18] have come to know the Lord or have we
[43:21] heeded his
[43:23] call you with me because we found out
[43:27] out that no man seeketh God love the way
[43:30] brother Mike put it God seeketh man but
[43:33] see we think God's out there in the
[43:35] universe seeking this no he's inside of
[43:37] the seed that he put in you and I before
[43:41] the foundation of the world and the deep
[43:44] is in their
[43:46] calling and when the Deep responds it
[43:49] says here am I Lord who said
[43:52] that who was that I've often said this
[43:56] in Matthew 16 when
[43:59] Peter made the
[44:01] Declaration Thou Art the Christ the son
[44:04] of the Living God in Me it would have
[44:07] been inside of me if I was Peter it
[44:09] would have been who said that
[44:12] yeah cuz remember Peter denied him a
[44:14] little while later so you see there was
[44:16] more to Peter than meets the eye there
[44:19] was another
[44:20] Peter there was another Peter in there
[44:23] but it was not it he hadn't been
[44:26] converted yet
[44:27] so as brother Mike would say last night
[44:30] there was a still Small Voice down
[44:32] inside that seat saying let me out of
[44:36] here I want out this ain't the real me
[44:40] that's right huh amen the real me is a
[44:43] Believer what's going on oh we're in a
[44:46] battle we're in a
[44:49] fight and the way you and I look at
[44:51] things because we're in the
[44:54] flesh we're creatures of time yes right
[44:57] right you know we have we have uh uh H
[45:01] perimeters and boundaries and and things
[45:04] that that that that that we bump into
[45:06] and that that hold us up and we stumble
[45:09] over and we have to climb over and we
[45:10] have to go
[45:12] under and we're in a battle amen and we
[45:14] think it's the greatest battle ever
[45:16] fought but let me tell you folks
[45:17] something for the bride of
[45:20] Christ she is
[45:23] Victorious over her old nature she becom
[45:27] the Overcomer of Revelations
[45:30] 3:21
[45:33] amen she's now in condition to fight
[45:38] amen oh bro I've been fighting all along
[45:40] but you're fighting yourself that's
[45:41] right and you're Your Own Worst Enemy
[45:45] you're see as long as the devil has got
[45:48] you and me occupied with battling within
[45:51] ourselves we can't be a soldier in the
[45:55] Army that's going to take it to the
[45:57] devil at the end we're busy fighting
[46:01] ourselves we're busy fighting with one
[46:05] another but the Bible declares this is
[46:08] not a battle against flesh and blood as
[46:12] a matter of fact the Bible confirms that
[46:14] Paul telling us that flesh and blood
[46:17] cannot inherit so here we are
[46:20] preoccupied spending what little time we
[46:22] have here on Earth fighting something
[46:25] that is not going to inherit right amen
[46:29] amen right bud we're in a different kind
[46:32] of a battle once be once H how do we
[46:35] become Victorious over the enemy that we
[46:38] call
[46:39] ourselves it's real simple love brother
[46:43] Mike again God and simplicity it's so
[46:46] simple that we're too busy and we
[46:49] Overlook it you know we we we we want we
[46:52] want to Google it yeah yeah we we want
[46:55] to go on the internet we want to find
[46:56] out what what a so so it's people why
[46:58] did you stay off the
[47:00] internet do you think it's doing you a
[47:02] bit of good oh brother I get a good deal
[47:04] on
[47:06] stuff that's not what you use it for
[47:09] yeah busy looking and occupying and
[47:13] presuming and assuming
[47:16] and okay and I'm not preaching against
[47:18] you don't don't oh brother Chris we
[47:20] can't you I didn't say that no I said
[47:22] you're in a battle Yeah amen you're in a
[47:25] war amen right
[47:27] so you got to be
[47:30] careful about the weapons that have been
[47:32] formed yes that's right huh no weapon
[47:36] has been formed that's
[47:38] right but you know as well as I do your
[47:40] mother said don't you run with those
[47:42] scissors
[47:44] yeah huh you could fall and stumble you
[47:48] could stumble oh we're getting into the
[47:50] now you could stumble that's
[47:53] right and accidentally impale yourself
[47:58] you with
[47:59] me a lot of people think Saul committed
[48:02] suicide he did
[48:03] not commit
[48:06] suicide huh brothers and sisters we're
[48:10] in the greatest battle ever fought amen
[48:14] but the greatest battle ever
[48:16] fought is taking it to the devil yeah
[48:20] amen it's so simple you want to overcome
[48:23] all you've got to do is believe yes the
[48:27] word of God which says I paid the price
[48:30] Jesus Christ said I paid the price for
[48:32] you my blood is sufficient my grace is
[48:37] sufficient that's what gave Paul
[48:39] strength abely think about it Paul
[48:42] struggled you know with with the battle
[48:45] inside of him what was it well he
[48:47] persecuted as we heard again that's why

[52:02] beginning y they're looking for other
[52:05] civilizations other Earths other lives
[52:09] sustainable brothers and sisters we
[52:11] could have saved them as a matter of
[52:13] fact if I ask for a show of hands of who

[52:17] money that say they just spent on the
[52:19] super
[52:20] telescope and give it to us who could
[52:22] give them the answer
[52:26] right they're looking for the God we
[52:29] serve sir Einstein was one of the few
[52:31] people brother brandham said in that
[52:33] sphere in that realm that
[52:36] admitted this has all got to have
[52:39] happened because of an in of an infinite
[52:43] being amen of course he didn't say
[52:45] Jehovah God but he recognized that
[52:48] somewhere out there is the center
[52:52] amen
[52:55] amen that's Center is centered right in
[53:00] your heart if he's living there at all
[53:04] and the only way he can live there is to
[53:07] have him had himself in there before
[53:10] time began so there is no end right amen
[53:16] that fulfills Revelations 10 for you and
[53:18] I time shall be no more oh the clock is
[53:21] still going to be moving the calendar is
[53:24] still going to be in the wall right
[53:27] but for the bride she's found the center
[53:30] of the universe and for her time means
[53:35] nothing absolutely nothing
[53:38] am now can we look from that perspective
[53:41] amen let's stop looking from the inside
[53:44] out and let's move outside the perimeter
[53:48] going beyond the camp and let's focus
[53:52] down on how God sees it amen amen
[53:56] because brothers and
[53:58] sisters that's what God is expecting out
[54:00] of you and me that's right
[54:02] amen I believe brother Mike again and I
[54:05] love referring to him because it's just
[54:07] so Dov Tales he talked about the the the
[54:10] he he he used a phrase I'm paraphrasing
[54:12] like the greatest uh uh event outside of
[54:18] Calvary I and I said brother Mike I put
[54:21] the word down yesterday in my notes
[54:23] before I ever come to church we are Co
[54:26] responsible yeah
[54:28] amen God has made you and me co-
[54:32] responsible amen for the other half of
[54:36] Calvary yes amen now we're not giving
[54:39] our lives for the sin of the world but
[54:41] what we are doing is we are taking the
[54:44] claim come on brother
[54:46] amen he paid the price but he never
[54:49] claimed brother Bram told us in the seal
[54:51] book you and I have been given the Reco
[54:55] responsibility what did I get that from
[54:57] you think marriage and divorce brother
[54:59] brandham said before the
[55:02] fall Eve was co-equal with Adam which
[55:06] was a type
[55:08] amen amen it was a type
[55:12] absolutely God wants you and I now to
[55:15] begin to look at his word from a
[55:18] different perspective we're not fighting
[55:20] flesh and blood so why would we want to
[55:22] use Flesh and Blood to to to oh well he
[55:25] said this and he said that
[55:28] yeah what we need to do is put on the
[55:30] mind of Christ
[55:32] amen amen now the mind of Christ was a
[55:35] special
[55:36] mind because Christ never bypassed his
[55:40] theophany amen you see he
[55:44] knew he might not have declared it all
[55:46] the time as you and I were talking
[55:48] brother Wade about men that have come
[55:50] and gone and and brother Brandon
[55:51] mingling with men how about Jesus Christ
[55:54] Judas the scariot same table he didn't
[55:56] kick him out of church right he didn't
[55:58] give him the
[56:00] boot you know how come cuz Judas was
[56:05] Sanctified so he had he had no
[56:10] premise to put him out yet he knew the
[56:14] son of predition look how sharp the
[56:17] devil is he climbs up into the Realms of
[56:21] sanctification so much so that he uses
[56:24] the same law that's going to condemn him
[56:27] according to the scripture if you live
[56:28] by the law you're going to die by the
[56:30] law and the devil uses the same law
[56:33] that's going to condemn him to try to
[56:35] bring you and I under
[56:38] condemnation true brother amen but we're
[56:41] still in the greatest battle ever
[56:44] fought and he ain't going to let up no I
[56:48] remember reading from this Pulpit one
[56:50] time a quote where brother Bram said
[56:52] he's going to be kicking and screaming
[56:54] while we toss him into the bottomless
[56:56] pit
[56:57] amen amen he's still going to be
[57:00] preaching his gospel he is amen
[57:05] yeah we're not fighting Flesh and Blood
[57:07] no God has called you and
[57:10] I to the highest Authority absolutely
[57:15] and that is to
[57:17] break the mold and break the
[57:22] hold that the devil has on the bride of
[57:27] Christ not the bride of Christ the way
[57:29] you and I think but the church the way
[57:31] she thinks
[57:35] right and that is to be to gain back the
[57:39] position that's right of co- equal
[57:43] having the mind of Christ is to believe
[57:46] it's not
[57:48] robbery right
[57:50] Amen to be equal with God now the pro
[57:55] the difference between between the bride
[57:57] of Christ and Lucifer is he doesn't want
[58:00] to be equal with God he wants to be
[58:02] above God he wants to sit in the house
[58:05] of God he wants everybody to worship him
[58:08] as he is God what do you think it's
[58:10] called Satan's zeden for what do you
[58:12] think it's called the God of this evil
[58:14] age for brothers and sisters you may not
[58:17] realize that each and every one of us in
[58:18] this room the devil is afraid of you
[58:23] yeah that's why as long as he can keep
[58:26] you and I fighting within
[58:29] ourselves he's got time yes he
[58:33] does that's that's it but I'm here to
[58:36] declare to you he's out of time yeah
[58:40] amen the Bride of Jesus Christ with the
[58:44] Eternal Word of God as her weapon that
[58:48] weapon is so powerful amen that weapon
[58:51] is so powerful I got to read it to you
[58:54] it's Hebrews 4:12 yes everybody knows
[58:57] these scriptures but listen to what the
[58:58] word the word of God is quick what's
[59:01] quick lifegiving yes amen it brings back
[59:05] to the life who who was singing Paul and
[59:08] Silas brings back to the life to the
[59:10] ones that's dead now i s there's a man
[59:13] in here so he fed 4,000 with just seven
[59:15] loaves of bread right amen right that's
[59:19] the God we serve yes amen that fulfills
[59:22] the scripture where Jesus said don't
[59:23] worry about where your next meal is
[59:25] coming from
[59:26] stop
[59:27] it we're so
[59:30] concerned we we we're focusing so much
[59:33] on on on the world the cosmos how much
[59:36] money we got how much we can make our
[59:38] Ambitions our education our scholarships
[59:41] there's nothing wrong with those things
[59:42] as long as they're kept in perspective
[59:44] but God should be number
[59:46] one always number one and who's number
[59:50] two not
[59:52] you you're number
[59:54] three Prophet said said your family yes
[59:57] right right family's number
[59:59] two and let me tell you something folks
[1:00:02] God keeps his word he is number one and
[1:00:05] he knows it he said there's only going
[1:00:08] to be one God and there ain't going to
[1:00:10] be no other gods before me and if you
[1:00:12] are my family you are number two yeah
[1:00:17] amen and in God's way of see you you and
[1:00:20] I are putting numbers on it but God is
[1:00:21] really telling you and I come on up yeah
[1:00:24] amen
[1:00:26] sit right next to me amen come on little
[1:00:29] Queen come on up and sit right next to
[1:00:31] me come on amen yeah and and and and and
[1:00:35] and if you'd like I'll tell you what
[1:00:37] I'll
[1:00:39] do I'll let you take it to the enemy
[1:00:44] yes yes Amen brother CU God's
[1:00:49] God he's already
[1:00:52] won he is the
[1:00:54] victory but he is Faith is our Victory
[1:00:57] yes sir that's right and that's the only
[1:00:59] way we're ever going to beat the enemy
[1:01:02] amen is by faith we heard it last night
[1:01:05] again oh you should have seen my
[1:01:07] notebook brother listen
[1:01:10] now Faith is the substance
[1:01:17] y it defeated hope
[1:01:21] yes see faith is the substance
[1:01:26] right those things that are hoped for
[1:01:28] are fine as brother Mike said until they
[1:01:30] get to a point where hope also relies on
[1:01:35] the element of Reason yeah yeah amen I
[1:01:41] hope it happens I hope it happens I hope
[1:01:44] so brother BR told us this is not a hope
[1:01:46] so
[1:01:48] religion this is a religion full of
[1:01:50] Faith amen is the
[1:01:54] evidence is that right
[1:01:57] faith is the substance yes faith is the
[1:02:02] evidence that what you don't see right
[1:02:05] now is waiting for you to bring it into
[1:02:09] existence by faith which is what the
[1:02:11] Bible says God did he formed and framed
[1:02:14] the worlds the universe
[1:02:24] right we need to get in the
[1:02:28] battle I was thinking about War I was
[1:02:31] thinking about battle I was thinking
[1:02:34] about fighting brother Wade and and and
[1:02:36] here's the
[1:02:39] way that you can fight the good
[1:02:42] fight and
[1:02:44] never doubt and never
[1:02:49] fear get in the
[1:02:52] fighten I'm I'm speaking from a witness
[1:02:55] brother Donnie when I before I was saved
[1:02:57] remember my daddy was a
[1:03:00] boxer when you're in the ring and the
[1:03:03] bell
[1:03:04] rings if you're afraid you've
[1:03:08] lost but what you've got to do is you've
[1:03:11] got to put your Reliance and your
[1:03:14] confidence in the trainer that trained
[1:03:16] you he he's he's watching your enemy he
[1:03:20] he knows and brother Brandon bring up
[1:03:22] sixc Smith and how he had the dream and
[1:03:24] so forth he knows
[1:03:27] the movements the style the stutters the
[1:03:31] steps the backwards the forward the left
[1:03:33] and the right the hook in the uppercut
[1:03:35] the right cross the knockout punch he
[1:03:38] knows it of the enemy so he's training
[1:03:40] you oh yeah too yeah amen that's right
[1:03:45] but he's also listen now it's not a
[1:03:47] matter of just defense in that training
[1:03:50] while you're figting the punches he
[1:03:52] tells you now he opens himself up when
[1:03:55] he gets in this when he steps just like
[1:03:58] this he's got this small opening give
[1:04:00] him an uppercut that's right it'll knock
[1:04:02] him out yeah come on he's got a glass
[1:04:04] jaw yeah
[1:04:05] amen GL amen no wonder why there's a sea
[1:04:09] of glass that's right Amen in the
[1:04:11] Bible judgment right brother amen
[1:04:14] brothers and sisters we're in we're in
[1:04:16] the driver's seat because God has
[1:04:19] introduce the driver's seat to you and I
[1:04:22] I believe we are a group of the people
[1:04:25] on this this planet there were
[1:04:28] 32,000 people ready and willing and able
[1:04:32] to go to battle in the days of Gideon
[1:04:35] and God said hold
[1:04:36] it he said uh this is what I want you to
[1:04:39] do Gideon I want you to go down to the
[1:04:41] flock there and I want you to make it
[1:04:43] clear to them that if there's anybody
[1:04:48] afraid if there's anybody doubtful y y
[1:04:51] if there's if there's anybody that's
[1:04:53] weak if there's anybody that like
[1:04:55] confidence I want you to tell them they
[1:04:58] can go home right you want me to use the
[1:05:01] word the Bible uses it's a return
[1:05:04] Ministry cuz he said tell him to
[1:05:08] return tell him to go back right
[1:05:12] amen and you know come on everybody has
[1:05:15] their weaknesses and it's like well I
[1:05:16] got my kids I got my job I got my you
[1:05:18] know I better I I okay God said God said
[1:05:21] it was okay so I'm going
[1:05:24] to I'm going to return
[1:05:27] that's the Bible uses
[1:05:28] it okay and they returned y the Bible
[1:05:32] says and then God said okay Gideon how
[1:05:35] many you got left I got 10,000 he said
[1:05:37] no no 10,000 isn't going to work here CU
[1:05:41] still the people of Israel are going to
[1:05:43] feel like they are
[1:05:46] yeah responsible yeah right did you get
[1:05:50] that yeah not co-responsible they're
[1:05:53] going to feel like they're responsible
[1:05:55] right for for the damage they do to the
[1:05:56] enemy yeah but we're not fighting Flesh
[1:05:59] and Blood here brothers and sisters you
[1:06:02] you ain't going to do to the devil like
[1:06:04] Israel done to their enemy right
[1:06:07] amen we don't have the ability to knock
[1:06:10] him out
[1:06:12] yeah but our trainer does amen and
[1:06:16] that's the Holy Ghost brother B told us
[1:06:19] yeah that's the teacher that's the
[1:06:21] instructor okay and isn't it does
[1:06:24] anybody ever found it curious in the
[1:06:25] Bible that that that that this the
[1:06:28] instructor is also the one who puts the
[1:06:31] seal on you oh it makes perfect sense to
[1:06:33] me when you're talking about training
[1:06:34] somebody you see the instructor takes
[1:06:36] you when when when when when you're
[1:06:38] moldable when when when when you can be
[1:06:41] manipulated and turned and twisted and
[1:06:44] and and and brought around and oh you're
[1:06:46] going to get brother Bram said in that
[1:06:47] dream why are you hit me so hard yeah
[1:06:51] right he said cuz I'm training you oh
[1:06:54] yeah yeah but she nearly knocked me out
[1:06:56] of the ring lifts me up a couple of feet
[1:06:59] off the ground he
[1:07:01] said he said I'm training you for
[1:07:03] something that's right amen and brother
[1:07:05] bab said I don't get it he said listen
[1:07:07] he said listen Billy he said when you
[1:07:09] get in there your opponent is every bit
[1:07:12] as tough as you are and he thinks he's
[1:07:14] better than you are and he thinks he's
[1:07:16] going to win and he thinks you're going
[1:07:18] to lose so the only defense you got is
[1:07:21] to be able to withstand his punches
[1:07:23] watch what he said because they stop the
[1:07:26] blood amen amen that's boxing you hit a
[1:07:30] man hard enough and it shocks his body
[1:07:34] and it stops momentarily the blood from
[1:07:36] flowing through his
[1:07:39] body but you got to recover instantly
[1:07:41] amen amen right see that's what the
[1:07:43] devil's trying to do he's trying to stop
[1:07:46] the blood amen he's trying to convince
[1:07:48] you by punching on you hard as he can
[1:07:52] that it's not worth it yeah on that it
[1:07:54] ain't working
[1:07:56] that that that what I'm trying to do is
[1:07:58] failing but there's Faith amen and faith
[1:08:01] says Nope the blood the blood that came
[1:08:05] from the cross and the body of Jesus
[1:08:08] Christ is the most powerful it's a sharp
[1:08:11] two-edged
[1:08:12] sword right
[1:08:14] amen you see because as the blood is the
[1:08:18] carrier of the life so is the word of
[1:08:21] God the word of God carries God's life
[1:08:25] in it
[1:08:26] it's a form of a carrier but where the
[1:08:30] prophet of God has brought you and I to
[1:08:32] today and the reason why we are the
[1:08:36] Overcomers of all seven stages of the
[1:08:39] journey amen you realize that each one
[1:08:42] of you by living in this age to get to
[1:08:46] the seventh stage of the journey has
[1:08:49] already overcome the six stages amen
[1:08:52] that's why the Sixth Seal was opened
[1:08:55] right because it was
[1:08:56] judgment and in the world you and I live
[1:08:59] in there are seven natural seals and
[1:09:01] there are seven spiritual seals amen the
[1:09:03] seven natural seals pertain to Israel
[1:09:06] and the church the seven Supernatural
[1:09:09] spiritual seals pertain to you and I and
[1:09:12] where do we find them at on the
[1:09:15] back of the book amen oh God knows what
[1:09:19] he's doing he knows how to train us I
[1:09:22] want you to notice there something about
[1:09:23] the book The Seven spiritual seals are
[1:09:27] here now a seal shows both sides so the
[1:09:32] seven that are out here are also
[1:09:35] imprinted in here has every anybody ever
[1:09:37] seen a seal from their uh notary public
[1:09:40] where they squeeze the paper and it
[1:09:42] shows the indentation on the paper flip
[1:09:44] the paper over y
[1:09:47] right it shows both sides that's an
[1:09:51] official seal yeah amen if it only shows
[1:09:54] on one side it can be
[1:09:57] counterfeit amen you can counterfeit the
[1:10:00] new notary public stamp oh yeah come on
[1:10:02] I can order one I just like the one that
[1:10:06] you got but you can't order God's
[1:10:10] sealen because it makes an imprint so
[1:10:13] solid you know brother bandam says when
[1:10:15] when a man pulls that woman up against
[1:10:18] him that is going to be his wife that
[1:10:21] she makes an imprint on him that that's
[1:10:25] the kind of seal that's represented by
[1:10:28] you and me God had us in him before the

[1:11:05] something about the the battle that
[1:11:07] Gideon was going to partake of as the
[1:11:11] leader 10,000 were
[1:11:13] left oh well you know everybody's pretty
[1:11:16] comfortable with it 10 grand you know

[1:11:23] I'll make it
[1:11:26] maybe that person will get injured and I
[1:11:29] won't I'll stay in the middle of
[1:11:31] everybody and that way everybody on the
[1:11:33] outside gets it God said thought you'd
[1:11:37] say that so I'll tell you what I'm going
[1:11:39] to do Gideon I want you now I'm going to
[1:11:43] do the
[1:11:43] separating the the first time God told
[1:11:46] him what to say but the second time he
[1:11:47] says now I'm going to do the separating
[1:11:49] get in you just follow my instructions
[1:11:51] right huh right he said now listen take
[1:11:54] them all down to the water hole all
[1:11:55] 10,000 of them down they have the 22,000
[1:11:58] left it's 32,000 and went down to 10,000
[1:12:01] because 22,000 left and 10,000 were left
[1:12:03] and God had a number in his now Gideon

[1:15:55] whipping the devil 100% so much so that
[1:16:00] he is bound by a
[1:16:02] chain amen of
[1:16:05] circumstances that's what the prophet
[1:16:06] that's a chain of circumstance for a
[1:16:09] thousand years so we can rest what are
[1:16:11] we going to rest for a thousand years
[1:16:12] for battle's not over yeah not you're
[1:16:16] right we get to go to a supper and a
[1:16:18] battle and a battle and a supper look
[1:16:21] what happened to
[1:16:22] Abraham after the battle was was over
[1:16:26] Abraham had MDC show up and they did
[1:16:30] some communion and then there was
[1:16:32] another little Gap in there and then
[1:16:34] they
[1:16:35] had the Lord's Supper
[1:16:39] yeah and guess who mzc
[1:16:42] is the pillar of
[1:16:44] fire huh what does the bible tell us
[1:16:48] when Joshua met the captain of the host
[1:16:52] of the Lord and by the word the word
[1:16:54] host is where they got the word Army
[1:16:56] from so a host is an army yes and we've
[1:17:00] seen in in in in in Psalms 27 they
[1:17:03] talked about a host there's an army amen
[1:17:07] 200,000,000 demons y there are my wife
[1:17:10] and I were recently at some meetings
[1:17:12] where brother Doug Baker did a little
[1:17:14] math y'all know he's a rocket scientist
[1:17:16] so he's real
[1:17:17] sharp
[1:17:19] retired and he did the math brother Wade
[1:17:21] and he he kind of used the numbers like
[1:17:23] brother brandham said if there's one in
[1:17:24] a million and there's this many million
[1:17:25] and and he got down to how many
[1:17:28] Christians there would be on the earth
[1:17:29] and then he divided up 200,000,000 into
[1:17:31] there's like
[1:17:32] 30 38,000 demons on each one of you
[1:17:37] fighting you you know I mean they're
[1:17:38] after you right amen I don't mean
[1:17:40] they're in you they're after you amen y
[1:17:42] if that math it okay so let's say he
[1:17:44] overshot the target brother wait and
[1:17:46] let's say there's 10,000 yeah right a
[1:17:48] piece it doesn't matter one of them is
[1:17:51] enough amen and if you got one and you
[1:17:54] kick him out he goes and gets his
[1:17:56] friends cuz he's coming back to fight
[1:17:58] for his place you know why because the
[1:18:02] angels that did not believe Michael's
[1:18:05] message left their first
[1:18:09] estate and they'd like to have it back
[1:18:12] now
[1:18:14] right they went out there and wandered
[1:18:16] around and said like the prodigal I got
[1:18:19] a place that I used to live
[1:18:23] in and this guy worked and he made good
[1:18:26] money and he took showers and he ate
[1:18:28] good food and I don't like living out
[1:18:30] here in the pigy
[1:18:33] yeah and and his buddies said where's
[1:18:36] that come on seven more come on let me
[1:18:41] take you and show you but if that house
[1:18:44] is filled with the King of Kings and the
[1:18:47] Lord of
[1:18:49] lords the captain of the host of the
[1:18:51] Lord that Joshua was so Joshua was not
[1:18:55] intimidated why cuz he put all his
[1:18:57] confidence in God's word cuz God's God
[1:19:00] told him Joshua listen now you're going
[1:19:02] to go to battle you're going to be the
[1:19:04] greatest General The Greatest Warrior
[1:19:06] I've ever had and what I want you to do
[1:19:10] is take me at my word
[1:19:12] Joshua and I want you to believe me and
[1:19:14] he already knew Joshua was going to
[1:19:16] believe him we heard that last night
[1:19:18] because the life of God was responding
[1:19:20] back and forth
[1:19:22] see he said you do it exactly the way my
[1:19:25] word says and you'll never lose brother
[1:19:27] brandom used it he said wouldn't it be
[1:19:29] nice to fight a war and not have the Red
[1:19:31] Cross not have the hospitals not need
[1:19:34] the doctors and the bandages and and not
[1:19:35] lose any blood or no Flesh Wounds
[1:19:39] nothing see what carried Joshua was his
[1:19:42] confidence in God's word he went into
[1:19:45] battle and think about this brothers and
[1:19:47] sisters let's say you're a person with
[1:19:50] one sword and you're facing 50
[1:19:53] Philistines
[1:19:55] 100
[1:19:57] 200 and in your soul the word of God has
[1:20:02] declared you can't get injured right
[1:20:06] come on W come you're the baddest man on
[1:20:09] the
[1:20:10] battlefield cuz you don't have anything
[1:20:12] or anybody to be afraid of you're not
[1:20:15] worried about Who's Got Your Back N cuz
[1:20:17] God's got your back oh yeah you're just
[1:20:19] taking the sword and you're mowing down
[1:20:21] the enemy like Samson did with a jaw
[1:20:24] bone an
[1:20:26] ass amen think about it that's the kind
[1:20:30] of confidence you and I are expected to
[1:20:34] place in God's word amen and when he met
[1:20:36] the captain of the host of the Lord the
[1:20:39] C he said who are you for us are are you
[1:20:42] for our enemies yeah I I want you to
[1:20:43] know he didn't say are you for us or
[1:20:45] against us he said are you for us are
[1:20:47] you for our enemies who side are you on
[1:20:50] Amen Joshua I can just imagine and the
[1:20:54] host the captain of the host had his
[1:20:56] draw s his sword drawn right
[1:21:00] right as soon as he spoke you see
[1:21:03] because the spoken word is always the
[1:21:05] original
[1:21:07] se he told Joshua who he
[1:21:10] was and he said
[1:21:14] Joshua take your shoes
[1:21:16] off for the ground you're standing on is
[1:21:20] who said that before in the
[1:21:22] Bible the pillar of Fire
[1:21:25] that was in the burning bush said that
[1:21:28] now you and I have access to the same
[1:21:32] Pillar of Fire but now it's not the
[1:21:35] captain of the host of the Lord on the
[1:21:37] outside it's the Lord himself on the
[1:21:40] inside and when you draw his word with
[1:21:43] the faith that you should have in it

[1:26:32] brother wonderful job amen glory great
[1:26:36] job for us today thank you brother Chris
[1:26:37] for yielding yourself to the Lord yeah
[1:26:39] last night we were all just kind of
[1:26:41] looking at each other and and I knew
[1:26:42] that sister Joan and brother Chris they
[1:26:44] were they knew that what Chris had
[1:26:46] preached before and I knew that that he
[1:26:48] was right on the beating in the same
[1:26:50] plowing in the same field so so we knew
[1:26:53] we were going to get a little extra that
[1:26:54] today so we sure appreciate and that's
[1:26:56] got to be God it's not a
[1:27:00] coincidence that you read the same
[1:27:02] scripture and a brother that's 2500
[1:27:04] miles away comes and preaches for you
[1:27:06] and he preaches the same thing you
[1:27:08] preach but brings it in a little
[1:27:09] different way a little different angle
[1:27:11] but it's all one word of
[1:27:14] God you know I was thinking while he was
[1:27:19] preaching this devil that that that he's
[1:27:22] talking about the advis
[1:27:25] all right the
[1:27:26] adversary he is right that's right God
[1:27:29] created him first physically created him
[1:27:33] first to be the worship Angel to to do
[1:27:36] his bidding stay in his position
[1:27:39] yeah but he didn't that's right Bible
[1:27:43] says iniquity was found in his heart he
[1:27:46] wanted to be above
[1:27:48] God he don't want to be God he wanted to
[1:27:51] be above God sure he wants to slide
[1:27:53] himself in and be like God and then sit
[1:27:56] in the temple of God showing himself to
[1:27:58] be as
[1:27:59] God but you know all that he's
[1:28:04] done you got that right chrisan what a
[1:28:06] waste of time all that he's done he
[1:28:10] never will touch something you have
[1:28:13] that's
[1:28:15] right as
[1:28:16] powerful as we think that the devil is
[1:28:20] we say the devil this and devil that no
[1:28:22] he's the right-hand man of God but he's
[1:28:24] fell and he's this and he's that and
[1:28:26] he's all over the world making people do
[1:28:27] stuff there's one thing he can't have
[1:28:30] that me and you have right here today if
[1:28:32] you're born again you have eternal
[1:28:35] life he was created and he's going to
[1:28:38] have an End Amen that's right and sure
[1:28:41] you had a time when you come down here
[1:28:43] and you were created in the womb of your
[1:28:45] mama and you came here on Earth but like
[1:28:48] Chris said before the foundation of the
[1:28:49] world that seat of God was up there and
[1:28:53] as I told the church Day sister Joanna
[1:28:55] don't ever say God don't like me or God
[1:28:57] hates me or God don't let if God ever
[1:28:59] loved you one time it's he can't change
[1:29:03] his
[1:29:04] mind he can't change his mind if he
[1:29:06] loved you one time amen if he says I
[1:29:09] love you Jesus said like you said make
[1:29:12] us one right as we are one in other
[1:29:15] words put us all back together again
[1:29:17] right right that's what we're doing so
[1:29:21] what power does Satan have he cannot
[1:29:23] touch your soul if you're born again
[1:29:25] it's something listen that's territory
[1:29:27] that as brother R said I was talking to
[1:29:29] last night brother R said he said you
[1:29:31] know get to a place to where Satan don't
[1:29:33] even know what to do with you see he's
[1:29:34] got thinks he's got this thing all
[1:29:36] figured out he thinks he's got this
[1:29:38] thing all figured out he's going to come
[1:29:40] down he's going to anoint a group of
[1:29:41] people and they're going to do what he
[1:29:42] said right and that's what happens to
[1:29:45] probably seven and a half or 7.9 billion
[1:29:49] people in the world on but there's one
[1:29:51] group of people that's right oh he can
[1:29:55] play he can have
[1:29:58] battles but he can't touch your soul if
[1:30:00] you're born again that's right he can't
[1:30:03] even go where you're going as I said at
[1:30:05] the funeral the other day death the
[1:30:07] death angel didn't take my daddy
[1:30:10] across CU he passed Jesus said you have
[1:30:14] passed from Death un life when you don't
[1:30:18] like something sister Joanna if he he
[1:30:20] likes dunky Donuts but if if if you
[1:30:22] didn't like Dunkey Donuts you pass right
[1:30:24] by it right oh no no I know you wouldn't
[1:30:26] but oh
[1:30:28] no you need to we'll get you some Dunkin
[1:30:32] Donut before you leave but what if you
[1:30:35] don't like something what you do you
[1:30:36] pass right by it yes that's what Jesus
[1:30:38] said you have passed right from Death un
[1:30:41] life so a death angel don't come and get
[1:30:43] a Christian oh no no no Michael comes
[1:30:47] and gets the
[1:30:48] Christians that's right he makes sure as
[1:30:51] Brother Richard Wilson boy I'm telling
[1:30:52] you I want to I want to put that quote
[1:30:54] down Brother Richard said brother Dale
[1:30:57] knew where to go when he
[1:31:01] passed he preached himself right into
[1:31:03] that place amen amen there's many
[1:31:07] people um I've always said the pope if
[1:31:11] he's not
[1:31:12] converted and these jihadist that's
[1:31:14] going to get these virgins when they
[1:31:16] pass away they have a real bad moment
[1:31:18] when they step over into another place
[1:31:21] cuz they're lost they don't know where
[1:31:22] they're at they think this is what
[1:31:24] they're going to get they're going to
[1:31:26] get you know be in the have 72 virgins
[1:31:29] and and the Pope says well I'm God here
[1:31:31] I'm I I'll be God over
[1:31:32] there no but you and I this is so real
[1:31:36] yes even eternity is so real on this
[1:31:40] side till if we do have to step over on
[1:31:42] the other side we just step right into
[1:31:44] eternity and it's not something that we
[1:31:46] have to that's why Paul said death
[1:31:49] where's your stain grave where's your
[1:31:52] victory we have all things through Jesus
[1:31:55] Christ because we passed from death into
[1:31:59] life can't kill a Christian we can kill
[1:32:02] the devil though like like I hope I hope
[1:32:05] we're there where we can all get a good
[1:32:07] swift kick when we kick him into that
[1:32:09] bottomless pit never to see him again
[1:32:12] but thank God we got a heavenly father
[1:32:14] that we're going to see for an eternity
[1:32:16] and we'll be able to commune with him
[1:32:18] and talk with he's not going to be
[1:32:19] somewhere Untouchable where we can't get
[1:32:20] to him he's not going to be setting up
[1:32:22] on a hill maybe he is but you going to
[1:32:24] be right there with him if you need to
[1:32:25] be oh praise God thank God for the word
[1:32:29] of God that we have in this end time
[1:32:31] that we can understand these things that
[1:32:33] the question mark has been taken out of
[1:32:35] the lot of a lot of things just because
[1:32:37] God sent us a prophet amen he sent us a
[1:32:40] prophet to get up to to be able to see
[1:32:42] these things and then what did he do he
[1:32:44] called us to come up and do the same
[1:32:46] thing he didn't leave us down here
[1:32:49] looking
[1:32:49] up no he said come up a little higher
[1:32:52] amen come up be eaglets he said your
[1:32:55] little eaglets so guess what we can fly
[1:32:58] too amen so we can get up and we can see
[1:33:00] Revelation and and understand things
[1:33:03] that that the the the world don't even
[1:33:05] understand you ask somebody sometimes
[1:33:08] what happens when you die oh it's
[1:33:10] horrible bad you know bad bad well if
[1:33:12] they knew God it wouldn't be that's
