[13:18] amen you come expecting again this
[13:21] afternoon here's some more of the Lord
[13:22] the word we sure enjoyed a little bit of
[13:25] Fellowship we got to have with the with
[13:27] the brother between services and um I
[13:30] tell you what you uh get to talk to
[13:32] somebody who's had the experiences that
[13:33] he has in India and overseas and my
[13:37] goodness just the respect that um
[13:40] that we have for for a man that has
[13:43] devoted his life and become a prisoner
[13:45] to the word to give to give himself like
[13:48] he has amen so um Let's uh we we
[13:51] certainly heard a wonderful message this
[13:53] morning about identifying ourselves in
[13:55] the word and if we can know who we are
[13:57] then uh the devil can't do nothing to us
[14:00] we've got we've got power that God has
[14:03] given to us if we can just identify
[14:05] ourself in the scripture if we can know
[14:07] who we are so I believe that the word is
[14:10] still a discerner of the thoughts and
[14:12] intents of the heart so if you have a
[14:13] need this afternoon just um open up your
[14:16] heart to receive it from God and I'm
[14:17] sure that God will meet your need is but
[14:19] let's sing let's sing as our brother
[14:21] comes forth to minister to us and uh God
[14:25] bless you
[14:26] Open the Eyes of My Heart
[14:31] [Music]
[14:37] I want to see
[14:43] to see you
[14:45] [Music]
[14:53] Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to
[14:59] see
[15:01] [Music]
[15:03] what I want I want to see you
[15:09] [Music]
[15:15] shining in the light of your glory
[15:20] pour out your power and love that's
[15:24] between
[15:29] [Music]
[15:36] shining in the light
[15:40] [Music]
[15:50] holy
[15:51] [Music]
[15:56] holy holy You Are Holy Holy Holy yes
[16:05] your holy holy holy I want to see you
[16:18] Hallelujah
[16:19] you know the thing that we need to do
[16:21] now
[16:23] is see the Christ in each one of us
[16:26] sometimes our flesh gets in the way
[16:30] but God hides behind the badger skin
[16:33] and sometimes there's just a lot of
[16:36] badger skin
[16:37] but it's the life that lives in it
[16:41] that's what makes the difference
[16:43] while you're standing if you'd open your
[16:45] Bibles to Hebrews the fourth chapter
[16:48] and we'll read verses one two and three
[16:52] we've been
[16:54] I guess I can say I enjoyed this morning
[16:57] I don't know if y'all did
[17:04] but there are times when a minister gets
[17:06] up to preach and seems like God sits
[17:08] down and then it's really difficult
[17:11] but God was with us this morning and I I
[17:13] really appreciated that
[17:15] Hebrews the fourth chapter it says
[17:17] starting in verse 1 it says let us
[17:19] therefore fear
[17:21] as to promise being leftist of entering
[17:23] into his rest any of you should seem to
[17:25] come short of it
[17:27] For unto us was the Gospel preached as
[17:29] well as unto them
[17:31] but the word preached did not profit
[17:33] them not being mixed with faith in them
[17:35] that heard it
[17:37] for we which have believed to enter into
[17:39] arrest as he said as I have sworn in my
[17:41] wrath if they shall enter into my rest
[17:43] although the works were finished from
[17:46] the foundation of the world
[17:48] and let's have word of Prayer
[17:51] our most gracious and loving Heavenly
[17:53] Father it is again our privilege
[17:55] to come and sit at your feet and to
[17:57] receive what you'd have for us this
[17:59] afternoon
[18:00] is my lot Lord again to stand before the
[18:03] purchase of your blood and Lord that's
[18:05] an awesome responsibility
[18:07] so Lord come and let you Minister let
[18:09] the words that are spoken Lord may they
[18:11] come from you so guide the thoughts of
[18:14] my mind The Words which I speak that
[18:16] Lord you might be glorified in US
[18:18] Grant this Lord I ask it in Jesus
[18:20] Christ's name amen you can be seated
[18:28] brother Branham in the first seal
[18:31] he makes mention of the fact that he has
[18:34] now called I am no longer going to call
[18:37] you Church
[18:38] but I'm going to call you bride
[18:40] so with the first seal that's when we
[18:42] actually in my opinion we've entered the
[18:44] bright age
[18:46] brother Branham from this point on in
[18:48] his ministry it took a turn
[18:50] because no longer was he trying to deal
[18:52] with so much the denominational system
[18:54] as he was sitting there and trying to
[18:57] take the bride and begin to encourage
[18:59] the bride this is who you are this is
[19:01] what you are because the bride has to
[19:03] grasp hold of what she is
[19:06] I can look through brother Brown's life
[19:08] in Ministry and I can see over the over
[19:10] the period of his life I can see where
[19:12] where God began to deal with him and
[19:14] different things and he came to more and
[19:16] more of a revelation of who he was
[19:18] when he started out he was a Baptist
[19:20] preacher
[19:21] God still deal with him giving him
[19:24] visions and things and God dealt with
[19:26] him in that way so that really he began
[19:28] to take and realize that whenever God
[19:31] gave him a vision that was true
[19:33] and he knew that exactly what what to do
[19:35] in the vision is exactly what would
[19:37] happen
[19:38] but then later on he began to look at
[19:40] how God dealt with him and he says he
[19:42] and and he began to go through the
[19:44] scriptures and all of a sudden he
[19:46] realizes the same way that God speaks to
[19:48] Prophet that's the way he's speaking to
[19:49] me
[19:50] and then he realized he had a he was a
[19:53] prophet and he and if you will he
[19:55] stepped into that Ministry
[19:57] later on when he when the discernment
[19:59] began he go he related it back he says
[20:01] well this is the same way that God was
[20:04] there speaking to Abraham and Sarah
[20:07] and so he and he refers back to that a
[20:09] number of times
[20:11] and then he basically began to step into
[20:13] that Ministry
[20:15] and then later on he began to he
[20:17] preached and I think it was in 63. he he
[20:20] preached the the church ages and it was
[20:23] after that I think it was the angel
[20:24] spoke to him and says now you read
[20:26] Malachi 4. and I think at that point in
[20:29] time then he realized he was the
[20:31] messenger to this age and he stepped
[20:34] into that office if you will and then
[20:36] when you come to the time of the seals
[20:38] you realize no I am the Messenger and I
[20:40] have been given a message and that
[20:42] message is to forerun the second coming
[20:43] of Jesus Christ and he and he says I
[20:46] have to be obedient to that message and
[20:49] he stresses that over and over and over
[20:50] again after the seals well he had to
[20:53] step into his office as he progressed
[20:55] through time well where are we we are
[20:58] the bride we've been sitting under the
[21:00] ministry of a prophet we've been sitting
[21:02] under and where God is actually trying
[21:04] to speak to the bride and tell her this
[21:06] is who you are this is what you are and
[21:08] we have to we have to move from the lady
[21:11] you'll see in church age we have to move
[21:12] and come up higher as John was spoken to
[21:15] come up higher come into the place where
[21:17] the revelation of the word come into the
[21:19] revelation of the seventh seal come into
[21:21] the revelation of who you are because
[21:23] now we have to step into the revelation
[21:25] of Who We Are
[21:27] we no longer can just church is not more
[21:30] than a Sunday morning social function
[21:32] no we have to become the message
[21:35] the message happens to be something we
[21:37] read or something we hear no we have to
[21:39] literally become what God says that we
[21:41] are we have to become the message for
[21:43] this hour
[21:44] and so here again like I say this this
[21:46] is a step that we have to take but it
[21:48] ain't it takes a change in our thinking
[21:51] because then you go into nominational
[21:53] systems and they remind you no you're
[21:55] just a sinner Say by Grace no this
[21:57] message tells me I am a Son of God who
[21:59] have been fully restored to my position
[22:01] with my father and if I have been fully
[22:03] restored to my positions my father I
[22:05] have the rights of of of a sonship in in
[22:07] that but then now it's coming to the
[22:10] place where we have to come to adoption
[22:12] that's right where it's no longer just
[22:15] learning how to do and learning how to
[22:16] do and learning how to do but now all of
[22:18] us and we've been taught and taught and
[22:19] taught now it's time for us to practice
[22:21] what we've what we have been taught you
[22:23] you take a person that goes to medical
[22:25] school yeah they teach you all the
[22:27] theory and they teach you this and they
[22:28] teach you all that but all of a sudden
[22:30] now you have to stand before a person
[22:31] and you have to diagnose we have to take
[22:34] all of that training and all of that
[22:35] knowledge and you have to apply it to
[22:36] the situation that you're at because now
[22:39] you are the responsible for that life
[22:41] well we have heard the message over and
[22:43] over and over again now we are
[22:45] responsible to take this message and
[22:46] live it
[22:48] further Madam in one place he says the
[22:50] people in in in in Wesley's time he says
[22:53] they took his message
[22:54] and they lived it yeah they became
[22:57] living Epistles read of all men so
[22:59] whenever some people see us now what
[23:01] should we be we should be the living
[23:03] examples of this message whenever they
[23:05] look at us they should be able to see
[23:07] the message and manifestation in in our
[23:09] lives
[23:11] it goes in Revelation 4 1 after this I
[23:14] looked and behold a door was open in
[23:16] heaven and a voice which I heard from
[23:18] the trumpet speaking with me come up
[23:20] hither I'm going to show you some things
[23:21] we know that the door is Jesus Christ so
[23:25] we at the the world is sitting in lady
[23:27] Lucia
[23:28] they're stuck there no but we are called
[23:31] to come higher we have to go through the
[23:33] door we have to be in Christ and one
[23:35] what what what what did John Hill he
[23:38] went up into the heavenlies and there
[23:39] all of a sudden the word was being
[23:41] opened to them the word was be revealed
[23:43] was being revealed to them when we look
[23:45] at the seals all of a sudden brother
[23:47] Brown says the book became a totally new
[23:49] book to you because no longer because he
[23:51] could go back and he could see the types
[23:52] he says well this this is the same way
[23:54] that God did here the same way that God
[23:56] did there and therefore he could take
[23:57] this and this and this and this and he
[23:58] could pull them all together see because
[24:00] it's the same spirit it's the same way
[24:02] that God had been working all the way
[24:03] through so he can relate things before
[24:05] he couldn't relate well now it has to
[24:08] come down unto us we have to be able to
[24:10] take the message we have to take the
[24:11] word of God and we have to go through
[24:13] the word of God and brother bounces we
[24:15] have to find ourselves in that word and
[24:17] when we find ourselves in that word and
[24:19] we can see that God always operated this
[24:20] way and this way and this way where God
[24:21] never changes well if God never changes
[24:24] and we approach God in the same way that
[24:25] and then God will have to operate
[24:27] through us the same way that he did back
[24:28] in there Jesus Christ yesterday today
[24:31] and forever
[24:33] so when two or three agree does touching
[24:35] any one thing if we ask God and God's
[24:37] presence is there then we know that God
[24:39] has already heard us and then we expect
[24:40] the results I mean that when we pray
[24:42] what do we expect
[24:44] all right why pray if you don't expect
[24:46] it I mean like one person said why worry
[24:50] if you're going to worry don't pray but
[24:51] if you pray don't worry
[24:53] I mean this is where it comes out but
[24:55] see this has to be a reality to us it
[24:58] has to be more than just words it
[25:00] changes our whole concept our whole way
[25:02] of thinking like I said let this mind be
[25:04] in you which was also in Christ he knew
[25:06] who he was he knew he was God expressed
[25:08] in human flesh well what are we we are
[25:11] now God expressed in human flesh all
[25:13] that God was important to Christ
[25:15] everything the Christ was the important
[25:16] to the church and therefore the church
[25:17] the bride has become the full
[25:19] manifestation of God upon the face of
[25:21] this Earth this is Who We Are
[25:24] this is who we are but we have to accept
[25:27] this
[25:28] life we have to look beyond our flesh we
[25:30] have to look beyond our shortcomings we
[25:32] have to look beyond our carnality we
[25:33] have to look at all all the mistakes we
[25:35] make like somebody says you know when
[25:37] what's the biggest mistake you made well
[25:39] this morning was getting out of bed okay
[25:41] but we have to come to the place where
[25:43] we're literally the word becomes such a
[25:45] reality to us until we actually step
[25:48] into him and then we allow him to lead
[25:51] into guiding directors through the life
[25:52] that we live
[25:54] I know there are times I get up in the
[25:56] morning since I'm retired my time is my
[25:58] own
[25:59] um but I also find out also I get up in
[26:01] the morning and I have my day planned
[26:02] out and all of a sudden we get a phone
[26:04] call and all of a sudden that takes care
[26:06] of that day you know God had something
[26:08] else in mind or we go someplace else and
[26:11] all of a sudden something else comes up
[26:12] and say well Laura obviously you have
[26:13] something else planned for me today just
[26:16] just lead me on but it's learning to
[26:18] follow the leading
[26:19] I know when we're in India you know it's
[26:22] when I'm in the states I figure I have
[26:24] control of what I'm doing I'm under that
[26:27] delusion but when I go into India I
[26:29] realize I'm not totally and I have no
[26:32] control over anything all of a sudden
[26:34] something will come up well you have to
[26:36] deal with it all of a sudden we're going
[26:37] to go here instead of here well okay
[26:39] Lord what are you wanting us to do and
[26:41] then situations arise people who need to
[26:43] want to be prayed for and all of a
[26:44] sudden the the the whole everything just
[26:47] changes so I figured well Lord obviously
[26:49] you have a different plan than what I
[26:50] have so Lord I have to follow your
[26:52] leading well now we have to do that even
[26:55] even you know just just to hear in the
[26:57] states we have to we have to be willing
[27:00] to be led by God
[27:08] I think I might have quoted this or in
[27:11] the morning he says in the bride coming
[27:12] of Christ coming out of the church
[27:14] there'll be have to be a shave waived
[27:15] again in the last days well that's what
[27:17] when when you look at brother Brown's
[27:19] Ministry that was the shave
[27:22] that was Jesus Christ coming and so
[27:24] expressing himself through the ministry
[27:26] of brother Branham it what was the whole
[27:28] thing it's to it's to show that the the
[27:30] full maturity of the word in his full
[27:33] power has been restored to the bride
[27:36] that means all of the power of God has
[27:39] been given to us
[27:41] there's no there there it's not you know
[27:44] we're not going to give you a little
[27:45] here and a little there no you have
[27:46] access to everything that's right but it
[27:49] takes the faith of it takes faith in God
[27:52] to operate that gift it takes the faith
[27:54] of God to actually believe that whatever
[27:55] he said that is true
[27:58] but too often we we we we we we we
[28:01] will not grasp over the fact we we lack
[28:04] the faith because we look at ourselves
[28:06] it's not about us it's never been about
[28:10] us it's always been about him brother
[28:12] Branham realizes not what I do it's what
[28:15] I allow God to do through me he says I
[28:17] have to take myself and I have to submit
[28:19] myself totally unto the will of God so
[28:21] that God can actually speak through me
[28:22] and God can lead me and God can guide me
[28:24] and God can have me do the different
[28:25] things that he does he says the things
[28:27] that you see on the platform he says
[28:29] this is nothing compared to what I have
[28:31] in real life all sudden God will tell me
[28:32] I want you to go to such and such a city
[28:34] I want you to be at a certain Street
[28:35] Corner such and such a time somebody's
[28:37] going to come this is the way they're
[28:38] going to be dressed they're going to
[28:39] have this problem and this problem this
[28:41] problem I want you to pray for them and
[28:42] I want you to leave and so he would go
[28:45] there he would be on the straight corner
[28:46] or something the person would come along
[28:47] he would pray for them and as soon as he
[28:49] was done praying he would he would he
[28:51] would he would exit
[28:53] he never stuck around for a thank you
[28:56] he never stuck around for him to be
[28:57] glorified oh my and brother Branham
[28:59] prayed for me also and they look around
[29:00] well where's this guy
[29:03] he did not want them to recognize him
[29:06] they wanted to recognize Jesus Christ
[29:08] they wanted to give the glory to Jesus
[29:11] Christ for the healing they wanted to
[29:12] acknowledge Jesus Christ was the one
[29:14] that provided for their needs and this
[29:16] is the way it comes with us when any
[29:18] time that we take ourselves and try and
[29:20] build ourselves up we're doing wrong
[29:22] it's not about us and everything points
[29:24] back to Jesus Christ brother Brown he
[29:26] says I wish the brother Brown Tabernacle
[29:28] was not named brother random Tabernacle
[29:30] I wish there was no you know there was
[29:31] nothing to remind the people of who I am
[29:34] he says I want people to see Jesus
[29:36] Christ well that's what we're supposed
[29:38] to be doing we're supposed to be having
[29:40] Jesus Christ live his life out through
[29:42] us that it's no longer us living but now
[29:44] it's God living his life through us and
[29:46] that way God gets all the glory
[29:50] so the full maturity of the word has
[29:53] been turned back to us in its full power
[29:57] if you believe that
[30:00] then use it
[30:03] but it's not for you to use for yourself
[30:07] it's for you to use so God can be
[30:10] glorified
[30:11] like I mentioned I think earlier I said
[30:13] brother Bradham he says oh yeah bring
[30:15] the hard cases bring the deaf and the
[30:17] Blind and the Blind and all this other
[30:18] kind of stuff and he says and and the
[30:20] angel says don't you do that
[30:22] he says I God placed that gift in you
[30:24] for a God to use
[30:26] well why is the power of God residing in
[30:28] you
[30:29] so God could use the power so God could
[30:32] be glorified so God could exalt himself
[30:34] it's also you know when I was looking at
[30:37] different things when when you begin to
[30:39] to look at how Jesus Christ in his
[30:41] ministry there was one man he was born
[30:43] blind
[30:45] that man had to be blind for so many be
[30:48] a number of years
[30:50] so Jesus Christ could come along and
[30:52] give him his sight
[30:54] why then
[30:55] so he could testify to the Sanhedrin
[30:58] Jesus Christ is God
[31:00] nobody else can do this but him so he
[31:03] had to live his life in blindness up
[31:04] until that point and we'll say God can
[31:06] come along and and could pay for them
[31:08] and give the man his sight so that he
[31:10] could testify before the Sanhedrin we
[31:12] don't understand the things going on in
[31:14] our life why did Esther have to be
[31:16] already being taken away from her uncle
[31:18] and going to you know be part of the
[31:20] Harem of of the king
[31:23] so that she could become the queen
[31:25] so then all of a sudden persecution came
[31:27] to the Jewish people all of a sudden she
[31:30] was in a position to save her own people
[31:32] you look at Joseph in his life what had
[31:34] happened God had given him dreams oh
[31:36] yeah my brothers are going to bow down
[31:38] to me even my parents are going to bow
[31:39] down unto me how is this going to be
[31:41] taking place he had to be sold into
[31:43] slavery he had to be put into prison and
[31:47] he had to sit in that prison until all
[31:48] of a sudden Pharaoh had a dream and then
[31:51] all of us oh yeah I remember yeah but
[31:52] there was me and you you didn't like to
[31:54] cook so you could kill the cook and you
[31:56] let me live but yeah this guy
[31:58] interpreted this dream he had to be in a
[32:00] particular prison he couldn't just be in
[32:02] any prison he had to be in the
[32:03] particular one and then all of a sudden
[32:05] Pharaoh called him up and says oh you
[32:07] interpret the dream he did and that's
[32:09] when all of a sudden is his brothers and
[32:11] stuff came and they had to bow down
[32:12] before but he had to go through all of
[32:14] that in his life to bring him to that
[32:16] point in his life where the vision that
[32:18] God had given or the dream that God had
[32:19] given him could come to its fulfillment
[32:22] well dick can you look back in your life
[32:24] why are you where you are
[32:25] how how did God direct your life to
[32:28] bring you to the places where you're at
[32:29] because God wants to fulfill something
[32:32] it's not just so that we can sit there
[32:35] and enjoy life or do whatever we're
[32:36] doing no he has a purpose for us being
[32:38] alive he has a purpose for his being
[32:40] here he has elected us for this
[32:42] generation that they tell me in running
[32:44] a race he says they always in a relay
[32:47] race they saved the best for last
[32:48] because he has to make up for he or she
[32:51] has to make up for the for the for the
[32:53] the the lack of speed and the other
[32:55] other ones
[32:57] we're the best
[33:02] we have to finish the race
[33:04] if we don't finish the race nobody else
[33:07] can come they the all those that have
[33:09] gone on before us they won't receive
[33:11] their Eternal reward they won't okay so
[33:13] we have to finish this race what is US
[33:15] finishing the race we have to become the
[33:17] maturity we have to be the bride we have
[33:19] to be the bride manifested we have to
[33:21] sit there we have to be the final voice
[33:23] to the final age we have to be the final
[33:25] manifestation of God in this generation
[33:27] because so that God can be glorified we
[33:29] are in Satan's Eden
[33:31] we stand out as a sore thumb
[33:34] because uh what's going on even Even in
[33:36] our nation he says they don't like
[33:38] Christianity they're doing everything
[33:39] they can against Christianity
[33:42] and when we're here all of a sudden if
[33:44] we challenge them all of a sudden we're
[33:45] you know we're caught taken before the
[33:47] magistrates and all the other kind of
[33:49] stuff because they don't like
[33:50] Christianity they're against everything
[33:52] that Christ stood for and so we are here
[33:55] and we are witnessing by the Lives who
[33:57] he lives and the things which we do or
[33:59] we are witnesses to the people that we
[34:01] go around the people we do our business
[34:02] with they have this notice something's
[34:05] different about you
[34:07] I I know
[34:09] I know my wife she worked as a doula
[34:11] it's a it's a labor support person
[34:14] and uh she worked for a number of years
[34:16] in a hospital there
[34:17] and um all of a sudden a lady would come
[34:20] in and she was having difficulty
[34:23] um and so all of a sudden Charlie would
[34:25] look at the situation quietly she would
[34:28] just pray
[34:29] and all of a sudden whatever the
[34:31] situation was it just changed
[34:34] the nurses and says you pray didn't you
[34:37] well yeah that's why I'm here
[34:41] well
[34:42] I mean but you know there were Miracles
[34:44] performed because she was there
[34:47] so that the women at the breach was if
[34:49] the baby was raised birth or something
[34:51] else or some other problems or things
[34:53] which were going on simply because she
[34:56] was there she could intercede for the
[34:58] patient which was there and by
[35:00] interceding all of a sudden everything
[35:02] changed
[35:04] well we when we come up and somebody had
[35:07] comes to us and wants prayer do you
[35:09] believe in your prayer
[35:12] if you believe in it then God will act
[35:14] upon it but if you do if you're just
[35:16] praying a prayer just to pray a prayer
[35:18] you might as well save your breath but
[35:20] if you could actually enter into the
[35:21] spirit of Christ and you can actually
[35:22] begin to enter into the suffering if you
[35:25] could enter into their feelings that
[35:26] they have all of us that oh this is
[35:28] going to be different because then it's
[35:30] no longer you now it's God working
[35:31] through you it's God ministering through
[35:33] you and then they'll all of a sudden
[35:35] then they'll give glory to God
[35:37] I know
[35:38] she's not going to like me for this
[35:41] there was a lady my wife does
[35:43] alterations for periodically this one
[35:46] lady came in and she brought something
[35:48] to be altered and and she said oh man
[35:50] I'm suffering terrible headache
[35:53] so Shirley says okay so Shirley put her
[35:55] hands pray for her and then started with
[35:58] doing the alteration stuff and
[36:00] a few minutes later this is my
[36:02] headache's all gone
[36:04] sure
[36:05] it had to go
[36:07] I mean
[36:10] I don't know how else to explain it if I
[36:12] pray I expect it if she prays she
[36:15] expects it well if we are expecting it
[36:17] and we believe it's it's God anointing
[36:18] us to do what we're doing then why not
[36:20] expect it and we expected that we expect
[36:23] automate the the outcome of whatever it
[36:25] is we prayed for
[36:28] right
[36:31] Paul in in this in the in what we read
[36:34] in the in in uh in Hebrews here
[36:37] Paul is referring to the children of
[36:39] Israel as they were delivered from Egypt
[36:42] and it's interesting when you begin to
[36:44] look at them all of a sudden here was
[36:46] God God sent Moses
[36:48] now Moses God had ordained to be the
[36:50] deliverer for the children of Israel
[36:54] um he tried it
[36:55] and his own efforts and he failed
[36:58] he had to run out of town he had to
[37:01] protect him you know save his own life
[37:03] he sent him in way brother batam expands
[37:05] it brother God gave him a hot tempered
[37:07] wife to kind of bring him down a few
[37:09] notches to the place where he could no
[37:12] longer speak he could no longer have a
[37:13] confidence in himself he would stutter
[37:15] and um he went out to the to the goats
[37:17] just to get away from household things
[37:20] and uh
[37:22] but if God had to bring him to the place
[37:26] I mean Moses was raised in all the the
[37:28] knowledge of the Egyptian he was being
[37:30] trained to be the next Pharaoh he had to
[37:33] be able to lead an army he had to be
[37:34] able to stand and if you're going to
[37:36] lead an army you have to stand there and
[37:38] have confidence where you're taking them
[37:40] in otherwise they're not going to follow
[37:42] I mean I was in the military I learned
[37:44] that a long time ago you got somebody
[37:45] well maybe we should maybe we shouldn't
[37:47] I'm not sure we should no no I ain't
[37:49] going to follow him
[37:50] but all of us as a Shard we gotta we're
[37:52] going to take this hill we have the
[37:54] power we have this we have that and he
[37:55] said come on man let's go okay by that
[37:58] by the enthusiasm yeah we'll we'll
[38:00] charge up the mountain because there's
[38:02] somebody we have a leader in front of us
[38:03] as all of us and we have confidence in
[38:05] well we have to have confidence in our
[38:08] God
[38:09] people had to have confidence in Moses
[38:11] if he was going to lead the children of
[38:13] Israel out but God had to reduce him to
[38:15] the place where Moses could no longer
[38:17] even had confidence in himself but then
[38:19] at the burning bush all of a sudden
[38:20] that'll change
[38:22] because all of a sudden he met something
[38:24] which would take the gift which God had
[38:26] placed in him from the beginning and he
[38:27] would take that gift and he would
[38:29] activate it for lack of a better word so
[38:31] when he went back into Egypt what did he
[38:32] do he all of a sudden he says the God
[38:34] has sent me here to lead you out of this
[38:36] out of out of Egypt
[38:38] and then God performed Miracles through
[38:40] him so people could have faith
[38:43] why did God send the prophet
[38:46] maybe when we were in denominational
[38:48] system what are the denominational
[38:50] system they had a theory of God
[38:52] they had a theory oh yeah God used to do
[38:55] this and God used to do that and we know
[38:57] God you're there there was healing yeah
[38:59] we can read in the Bible that God did
[39:00] healing here and God did Miracles here
[39:03] but all of a sudden when God came and
[39:04] brother Branham and all of a sudden that
[39:06] we saw the Miracles in the manifestation
[39:07] like one Minister said all of a sudden
[39:09] God was updated he became a reality
[39:13] God became more than something just a
[39:15] theory God was more than just a spirit
[39:17] that floats Around Here There and
[39:18] Everywhere else no all of a sudden God
[39:20] became a reality to him
[39:23] well when I was introduced to this
[39:25] message I mean I was raised in a Baptist
[39:26] Church
[39:27] yeah they hear stories
[39:30] but all of a sudden in brother Brown's
[39:31] life all of a sudden there there's
[39:33] miracles
[39:34] I mean this is book of Acts again I mean
[39:37] this goes back to Jesus Christ This goes
[39:39] back back into the Bible this goes back
[39:41] into the reality that God is actually
[39:42] real well if God Is that real and that
[39:46] was that real to him now we have to take
[39:48] that same God or have it real in US
[39:51] because if you leave it on the prophet
[39:53] it does you no good
[39:54] but all of a sudden when you can take
[39:56] whether God that was in him and place
[39:58] that same God in you and begin to
[39:59] realize God is the same yesterday today
[40:01] and forever then all of a sudden that
[40:03] God becomes a reality to you and the
[40:05] more you walk with him the more of a
[40:07] reality he becomes
[40:10] I mean we've seen situations in our in
[40:12] there was one situation that we were at
[40:14] in India just to give you an idea
[40:17] um I'm always punctual that's bad habit
[40:20] but that's just the way I am
[40:22] and we were sitting there and and the
[40:24] brothers were yeah they they like to eat
[40:27] so they ate and they kept eating and we
[40:30] we released we left about two hours
[40:32] later than we should have to go to the
[40:34] next meeting which made me all upset and
[40:37] then we get into the to this Village we
[40:39] were at and
[40:40] and here again I mean we were late and I
[40:43] was mad
[40:44] I'm being honest with y'all
[40:46] and all of a sudden this guy jumps out
[40:48] in front of the car stop stop emergency
[40:50] emergency I figured great we're already
[40:53] late what are we going to do now here's
[40:55] this guy what's going on
[40:56] so they led us down this alleyway
[40:59] Last House on the Left
[41:01] we entered into this into the little Hut
[41:05] and all of us know is this girl probably
[41:07] mid-20s
[41:08] and I looked at her and I figured
[41:11] what's the deal going on
[41:13] well some Minister had told her you have
[41:15] an evil Wicked spirit because your
[41:17] husband and your children had died and
[41:19] you have to fast for 40 days in order
[41:21] for this evil spirit to leave
[41:23] they don't have the mass they don't have
[41:26] what it would take to fast for 40 days
[41:29] this girl I'm in obedience to what this
[41:32] man had said she tried that
[41:34] she got to the place where all of her
[41:36] systems was being getting to shut down
[41:38] her her liver and her kidneys and all
[41:40] the other kind of stuff they finally
[41:42] took her to the hospital and they looked
[41:43] at her and says she's Beyond hope
[41:45] there's nothing we can do for her
[41:47] and I looked at the situation I says and
[41:50] all of a sudden I when I prayed I said
[41:52] Lord don't look at the stupidity of the
[41:54] ACT but look at the sincerity of her
[41:57] heart and give her her life back
[42:00] from that point on her system's
[42:02] rejuvenated and for Sheila I think she
[42:04] lived for about two or three years after
[42:05] that
[42:06] nice strong healthy young woman it's not
[42:09] about me
[42:11] but I mean my mental condition was
[42:13] anything but prayer
[42:16] but yet God intervened because he had a
[42:19] need and he wanted to use me in that
[42:20] position to sit there and Speak Life
[42:22] back into that young lady
[42:24] so God you don't know the situation that
[42:27] you're going to be and you don't know
[42:29] all of a sudden you might end up in a
[42:30] situation where all of a sudden there's
[42:32] an emergency and God wants to use you to
[42:34] pray the life back into that person or
[42:37] be able to pray for somebody to give
[42:39] them the healing or pray for somebody
[42:40] for the needs which they are it's not
[42:42] about the person it's about the God in
[42:44] you
[42:45] if we can get it away from us and begin
[42:48] to realize no this is God this is the
[42:50] god that's Eternal this is the god that
[42:52] created the universe this is the god who
[42:54] walked us who we look in in the life of
[42:56] Jesus Christ this is the same God that
[42:58] dwelts in him dwells in you the same God
[43:00] it was in the prophet dwells in you
[43:01] there's no difference
[43:03] that was merely the body that God wanted
[43:06] to use at that period of time but now
[43:08] what hasn't God has taken the prophet
[43:10] home what is he wanting to do now he's
[43:12] in our body yes he's in you he dwells in
[43:14] you there's no difference here you have
[43:17] to release the god that is in you you
[43:19] have to all of a sudden yield to the
[43:21] spirit of God as he guides and he as he
[43:23] directs your life because yoka will run
[43:25] across situations all of a sudden God
[43:27] needs you
[43:29] there's nobody else around God needs you
[43:31] so just open up and follow the
[43:33] leadership of God in your life God is no
[43:36] respecter of persons
[43:41] it says in Isaiah Whom Shall he teach
[43:43] knowledge and to whom shall he make to
[43:45] understand Doctrine them that are weaned
[43:47] from the Malkin drawn from the breasts
[43:49] for precept must be upon precept precept
[43:51] upon precept line up online line upon
[43:53] line here little and there little for
[43:55] with stammering lips and another tongue
[43:57] will he speak to this people
[43:58] to whom he said this is the rest which
[44:01] will you may cause the weary to rest and
[44:03] this is refreshing but they would not
[44:04] hear he's talking here what we talk what
[44:06] we talk about the baptism of the Holy
[44:08] Spirit when all of a sudden I mean we
[44:10] speak in tongues you know I'm used to
[44:12] some students some don't
[44:14] um but that's basically what this is
[44:17] referring to but this is the rest
[44:21] it's no longer should be a struggle
[44:24] if we can rest in God
[44:27] and God leading
[44:29] then there's no struggle then there's no
[44:31] fight then there then there's no there's
[44:33] no problem
[44:34] if if you've been taken
[44:37] if you've been taken and been trained in
[44:39] a certain way
[44:40] then then you know type people are
[44:43] they're mechanics I mean if you've done
[44:44] it enough all of a sudden somebody
[44:46] brings a car in it has this problem in
[44:48] this one oh yeah I've seen that a
[44:49] hundred times yeah okay bring it over
[44:51] here we'll take care of it
[44:52] there's rest you're not struggling
[44:54] wonder what it is wonder what the
[44:56] problem is no no you know
[44:58] because of by your team for by your
[45:00] training and by your teaching and by the
[45:02] knowledge that you have you know how to
[45:04] fix this problem because you've seen it
[45:05] before well Jesus Christ is the same
[45:08] yesterday today and forever he already
[45:10] knows the problem he already has the
[45:12] answer so if you can rest in him and let
[45:14] him do the work through you then it's no
[45:16] longer you trying it's no longer you
[45:18] struggling well Lord what am I supposed
[45:20] to do what am I supposed to do how
[45:21] should I do this I said no no just rest
[45:23] in him
[45:24] and then all of a sudden he will give
[45:26] you the inspiration he will give you the
[45:28] words to say because it's no longer
[45:29] about you and then it becomes about him
[45:31] and God wants to take care of the need
[45:33] before and all of a sudden it becomes
[45:35] him operating and working through you
[45:41] we talked about it and I guess earlier
[45:44] this morning faith is unconscious
[45:46] we all have faith we just don't realize
[45:48] it we don't exercise it
[45:52] because we would take Faith if we would
[45:54] we begin to realize God is the one in
[45:56] control I mean I I mean I look at all of
[46:00] a sudden you know we were in India and
[46:02] we came back and we had plans to go
[46:04] someplace else and all of a sudden covet
[46:06] hit but that set the world down
[46:08] there was no flights going anywhere
[46:10] okay well was this a surprise to God
[46:15] he knew about it
[46:16] he knew what our government would do he
[46:18] knew what the airlines would do he know
[46:20] that I couldn't get to India if I had
[46:22] wanted to for that uh what almost two
[46:24] years there was no way to get into India
[46:27] in fact one guy he lived in India and he
[46:29] happened to have been in Africa doing
[46:31] something it took me almost a year to be
[46:34] able to get back home
[46:36] and then he finally got a flight and it
[46:37] just got into Bombay and then but there
[46:39] was no other flights within the country
[46:41] so then he had to rent a car and he had
[46:43] to drive all the way from the from the
[46:45] west coast to the east coast and and he
[46:47] had to get some other people to help
[46:49] Supply the money for the gas and stuff
[46:51] but he was almost a year before he got
[46:53] home because there was no way to get
[46:55] home the people in Indy all of a sudden
[46:57] they found themselves if you were in a
[46:59] work crew and somebody had hired and he
[47:01] normally he goes into a village and
[47:02] hires all the able-bodied men and he
[47:04] would take them hundreds of miles away
[47:05] all of a sudden there was no
[47:07] Transportation they had to walk a
[47:09] hundred miles or better just to get home
[47:12] but God knows this
[47:15] it wasn't a surprise to him because
[47:18] what's he doing he's taking the whole
[47:20] world and he's changing the whole
[47:21] economy of the world what so the every
[47:23] all the economies have to fall the our
[47:26] economy in America has to fall because
[47:28] this will bring in the this it has to
[47:31] fall so the Jesus Christ can come and
[47:33] set up his kingdom for the Millennium so
[47:36] that's why everything is the way that it
[47:37] is that's why our economy is going to
[47:40] where it's going
[47:41] hi everybody
[47:43] God has a plan
[47:45] God has a purpose
[47:48] but if we know that it's God then why do
[47:50] we worry
[47:52] because we rest in him he promised to
[47:55] supply our needs he promised to take
[47:58] care of us he promised to heal us he
[48:00] promised to see to it but I think what
[48:02] David he said I've never seen the the
[48:05] children of God begging bread
[48:07] well okay so I'm I that's what I expect
[48:10] Lord if all of a sudden there's nothing
[48:11] all of us are okay I don't know how you
[48:13] supply it but you said you would so now
[48:15] we just wait for it to come
[48:17] there um there's a book I read the Reese
[48:20] Howell the intercessor this was written
[48:22] during the second World War
[48:25] and the guy had an orphanage and and
[48:28] this is one important thing and the
[48:30] thing
[48:31] um all of a sudden he had a bunch of
[48:33] kids to feed and there was no food
[48:35] and God spoke to me says well if you
[48:37] have the food what would you do
[48:39] Well we'd thank him for it
[48:42] well
[48:43] so they started praying and thanking God
[48:45] and there was nothing on the table
[48:48] well third we thank you for the food you
[48:50] supplies we thank you for the blessing
[48:52] that you you know and as soon as he said
[48:54] amen there was a knock at the door
[48:56] there was a bread truck that broke down
[48:58] just in front of the orphanage and it
[49:00] had no way to deliver the bread so all
[49:02] that bread got to the orphanage
[49:06] God already knew
[49:08] but he was trying the man he says
[49:10] where's your faith
[49:11] where is your faith another one that God
[49:14] had told him he says I want you to go to
[49:16] a certain certain city the guy says I
[49:18] don't have any money for the point for
[49:19] the for the for the for the Trade Fair
[49:21] and God says well if you had it what
[49:24] would you do well I'd get in line
[49:27] well
[49:29] okay he gets in line all of a sudden
[49:32] it's he was the next one to step up to
[49:35] the window
[49:36] and somebody says here
[49:38] somebody told me God told me to give you
[49:40] this
[49:42] God is never late but he's always very
[49:45] seldom early
[49:47] because he wants do you trust me
[49:51] have you raised a place in your
[49:52] relationship with me that you trust me
[49:55] because this is where it's going to come
[49:57] down to us in our lives do we trust God
[50:00] do we actually acknowledge Him has it
[50:02] come to the place in our relationship
[50:04] with God regardless of what happens are
[50:06] you do we believe that God's going to
[50:07] supply do we believe that God will take
[50:09] care of us do we believe that God will
[50:10] do this
[50:13] but we have to come down to the place
[50:15] where we actually believe this
[50:19] like like I think I might have read this
[50:21] this morning he said that the disciples
[50:22] had the word because Jesus Christ was
[50:24] there
[50:25] and Jesus Christ says I'm giving you the
[50:27] authority to go and to heal the sick and
[50:29] raise the Dead
[50:30] go around to The Villages send them out
[50:32] two by two
[50:34] and so they would go out and and I kept
[50:37] wondering you know if they when they
[50:38] came to a village and they saw a
[50:40] cripplet sitting at the gate
[50:43] um what what was their reaction they had
[50:46] seen Jesus do all the Miracles they knew
[50:48] he could
[50:49] but them to do it
[50:52] but then they went ahead and they prayed
[50:54] for the man at the gate the man made me
[50:57] he was a and all of a sudden God
[50:59] healed them
[51:01] and that would have given them faith and
[51:02] then they would have gone on further and
[51:04] they would go into the villages and then
[51:06] after where they got together and all
[51:07] had a they began to give testimony
[51:10] service of what God had done for them as
[51:12] they'd walked into the different
[51:13] Villages and seen all these things and
[51:15] and my in my mind's thinking Jesus
[51:17] Christ would have sat back and he would
[51:18] have rejoined finally you understand
[51:20] finally you understand and then and
[51:22] finally he said he says no no
[51:25] about the Miracles and stuff he says he
[51:28] says that should be normal to you
[51:29] because of who you are
[51:31] you're sons of God this is your rightful
[51:33] position this is what you should be
[51:34] doing
[51:35] he's a big Rejoice because your name's
[51:38] written in heaven
[51:39] Rejoice because you are a part of God
[51:41] Rejoice because you are part of God from
[51:43] the beginning this is who you are this
[51:45] is what you should be doing this and and
[51:47] so all of a sudden because of that then
[51:49] then they could go and they could begin
[51:50] to do the different thing
[51:52] but then this one man brought it to
[51:54] another his kids to the disciples after
[51:57] a while and and and the disciples didn't
[52:00] they they couldn't cast The Demon out of
[52:02] the man out of the Sun
[52:04] and Jesus says you know bring him to me
[52:07] and Jesus began to pray with me and the
[52:09] disciples asked why couldn't we do this
[52:12] he says because you didn't have a faith
[52:14] oh ye of little faith have you had the
[52:16] faith to believe it this would have been
[52:18] taken care of why do I have to do this
[52:20] God should have been able to do it
[52:22] through you but you have to have the
[52:23] faith you have to understand who you are
[52:25] they have to begin to realize that we
[52:27] are they were Sons and Daughters of God
[52:29] they had to realize that God now dwelt
[52:31] in them that Jesus Christ had given them
[52:33] the authority to do and to take care of
[52:36] of the situations which which fell
[52:38] before them and God is that Authority
[52:41] has never been removed
[52:44] The Authority that Jesus Christ gave the
[52:46] disciples that Authority is still still
[52:49] available to all of us
[52:51] but you have to believe it
[52:54] like I said the talk we were eating
[52:56] there in in the scripture he says he
[52:58] says God had taken it through Moses and
[53:00] he'd performed all these Miracles and
[53:02] all these wonderful things like that God
[53:04] was trying to demonstrate to them this
[53:06] is who I am
[53:08] I control the weather I control I can I
[53:10] can create I can destroy I can do all
[53:12] these these things but you have to have
[53:14] faith in me
[53:15] you have to believe that I am God you
[53:18] have to believe that I can do all things
[53:20] that I am all I'm I am also praying I am
[53:23] all-powerful you have to believe this
[53:26] he got with that was God was trying to
[53:28] demonstrate but it goes on to them for
[53:30] for the
[53:32] um
[53:35] was the Gospel of Praise as well as unto
[53:38] them
[53:39] but the word preach did not profit them
[53:42] not being mixed with the in faith
[53:45] that it heard it
[53:48] and when you go into one of the Psalms
[53:50] the the way that the psalmist pushed it
[53:52] he says oh yeah God provided this let's
[53:53] see if he can do this now God provided a
[53:56] certain quiet or maybe he can supply us
[53:58] beef God did this and to him well let's
[54:00] see if he can do that but they were
[54:02] always challenging God it wasn't that
[54:04] they had faith in that God they were
[54:05] just trying to putting out to God well
[54:07] let's see if you can do this this is
[54:09] what we want now let's see if you can do
[54:10] this and that wasn't how God operated
[54:13] but it comes down to we we've we've seen
[54:16] through the prophets Ministry we have
[54:18] seen God perform
[54:20] there is no questions in our mind that's
[54:22] why people always wanted to go see the
[54:24] prophet or if the prophet prays for me I
[54:26] know I can be healed what about your
[54:28] what about your your pastor what about
[54:30] the one sitting next to you you don't
[54:33] believe in their prayers I know when we
[54:35] were in India that there was a sister
[54:37] that came up I was praying for one
[54:39] person and the guy I was with he was
[54:41] praying for this other sister
[54:43] and uh so then what I was praying for
[54:45] left and so this lady came over to me
[54:49] I looked at her and I said do you
[54:51] believe his prayer
[54:52] and she just stared at me I said if you
[54:54] didn't believe his prayer you won't
[54:55] believe in mine so just go
[54:59] I mean brother Bradham says if you
[55:01] prayed for something he says don't go
[55:03] back the second time
[55:05] because it showed you didn't have faith
[55:06] the first time and the more that you go
[55:09] up for the same thing he says all of a
[55:10] sudden your faith becomes less and less
[55:12] and less no you have to take God at his
[55:15] word you have to really he prayed for me
[55:17] and God he they laid hands on me if they
[55:19] laid hands on me I am healed because God
[55:21] said I'm Healed and you just accept it
[55:23] and you begin to thank him for it
[55:25] I I know there was a time during the
[55:27] Cove it surely was was real sick and I
[55:29] had prayed for her and stuff but I I
[55:31] wanted something a little more I guess
[55:34] you'd call it
[55:35] during covert we were only allowed 10
[55:37] people in church
[55:38] I found out there was only seven
[55:41] so we could go
[55:45] I went to the pastor and I said surely
[55:47] is sick
[55:48] the Bible says call for the Elders of
[55:50] the church let them lay hands on them
[55:51] let them anoint with oil prepare our
[55:53] faith shall save the sick I says I want
[55:55] that from my wife
[55:56] okay
[55:59] they anoint her with oil they prayed for
[56:01] her yeah it was a done deal
[56:03] I did what the scriptures had taught I
[56:06] needed that extra little things that I
[56:08] could relate back to the scriptures with
[56:10] so I could shall and say no say do we we
[56:13] follow what God Said in his words
[56:14] because we follow what God Said to his
[56:16] word now God is obligated to fulfill his
[56:19] word in her life
[56:20] and from that point on we began to thank
[56:22] him thank you Lord for this and thank
[56:24] you Lord for doing this and the other
[56:25] when I was in uh we were in in Youth
[56:28] Camp we we've helped out there for a
[56:31] number of years
[56:33] and it was interesting we were there and
[56:35] uh
[56:36] we had one service
[56:38] and you know at the end of the service
[56:40] the the the Evangelist or the minister
[56:43] he gives an altar call and all these
[56:44] people come running forward
[56:46] and so we as the ministers we went ahead
[56:48] and laid hands on the different ones and
[56:50] tried to figure out their needs and pray
[56:52] for them accordingly
[56:54] the next night also another Minister and
[56:57] he gave him an altar column I noticed
[57:00] the same amount of people came forward
[57:03] okay so we went and prayed and prayed
[57:05] and prayed
[57:06] third night was the same
[57:09] I says Lord I don't understand this
[57:13] why can't they accept
[57:16] but we have already prayed for them for
[57:19] and some thoughts came in my mind for
[57:21] the lack of better way of expressing it
[57:24] where all of a sudden it's kind of like
[57:25] Astoria says there was this there was
[57:27] this girl
[57:28] and she was out in the streets begging
[57:31] I mean her clothes was filthy her hair
[57:34] was a mess and just and she was begging
[57:36] just give me a little piece of bread
[57:37] just just a little more sort of bread
[57:39] I'm so hungry just serve with me just a
[57:41] little bit of something
[57:42] and finally I mean she did this for a
[57:44] while and finally she says you know
[57:46] there there's a guy in the mountain on
[57:48] the hilltop
[57:50] and uh maybe he'll be nice maybe he will
[57:53] give me something
[57:55] and so she goes up in the door and she
[57:57] knocks in the door and the good man of
[57:58] the house opens it up and she is begging
[58:00] please give me just a little piece of
[58:02] bread just just a little more sir but
[58:04] I'm so hungry I haven't eaten for days
[58:05] just a little something
[58:07] and all of a sudden the man looks at now
[58:09] and says sure sweetheart
[58:11] what are you doing out here begging
[58:14] you you're my wife
[58:17] this is this is your house
[58:19] oh honey look at your clothes they're so
[58:21] filthy go in and take a bath you know
[58:23] washing of the Water by the word
[58:25] oh and you're dressed there's plenty
[58:28] hanging in there just just clothe
[58:29] yourself in the garments of
[58:31] righteousness
[58:32] and there we have table spread we've
[58:34] been waiting for you to come back and
[58:36] everything that you want to eat has
[58:38] always been there it's all been waiting
[58:40] for you to come
[58:42] you don't have to beg this is yours
[58:44] this is your house this is where you
[58:46] live
[58:48] we don't have to beg
[58:52] I don't go to God as a beggar
[58:55] I go to him as his wife
[58:57] because I'm his bride right
[59:00] I go to him as his right washing of the
[59:03] Water by the word I'm clothed in his
[59:05] righteousness every time I read the word
[59:07] it's just cleansing me and cleansing me
[59:08] it's keeping me pure and what do I do I
[59:10] sit down at his table it's always spread
[59:12] out before me and I just Feast upon the
[59:14] word I Feast upon I listen to the
[59:16] message I listen to it I read it I study
[59:18] it and I go through the Bible and I read
[59:20] it and I study it it just constantly
[59:22] taking the word into my life into my
[59:24] until literally I and the word hopefully
[59:26] eventually will just become one
[59:29] but I don't have to beg
[59:32] and that's what these kids were doing
[59:34] they're always begging for a morsel of
[59:36] Breadwinners rightfully theirs by who
[59:37] they were
[59:39] there's one Minister here this one
[59:41] sister was there and I mean there were
[59:43] men too okay I'm not picking on the
[59:45] sisters but to this this was the example
[59:47] and and this girl was crying out and
[59:50] crying out and crying out and finally
[59:51] the ministers went over there and says
[59:54] why don't you start thanking him
[59:57] don't beg why don't you start thanking
[59:59] him for what you're wanting
[1:00:01] and so she changed her tune she began to
[1:00:03] praise God and thank him for whatever it
[1:00:06] was she had Nita and a few minutes later
[1:00:08] all of a sudden she was running the
[1:00:09] aisles she was standing rejoicing
[1:00:11] because she was no longer begging she
[1:00:13] had accepted now what God has rightfully
[1:00:15] given her by virtue who she is
[1:00:18] you don't have to beg God
[1:00:21] he wants he actually wants to give it to
[1:00:23] you
[1:00:24] he wants to give you about to play press
[1:00:27] down overflowing or something he wants
[1:00:29] to give it to you because of who you are
[1:00:31] you are his child you are his wife
[1:00:34] so why beg
[1:00:36] I mean my wife and I yeah we you know
[1:00:39] she has the credit card
[1:00:41] she knows where the bank balance is
[1:00:44] you know I says you know just don't
[1:00:46] overdraw you're fine
[1:00:48] but I mean it it it's
[1:00:51] if we have it why not
[1:00:53] okay
[1:00:55] why should I deny her what she has need
[1:00:57] of
[1:00:59] when I have the means to provide for
[1:01:01] that
[1:01:01] well God is no different he is he is our
[1:01:04] husband he and and there's no limits to
[1:01:07] him you have need of healing he's
[1:01:09] already healed you it's already paid for
[1:01:11] why not just accept it why not just
[1:01:13] praise him for it
[1:01:15] healing is a process
[1:01:17] it's not a miracle healing is a process
[1:01:21] so sometimes we get sick so yeah I mean
[1:01:24] I I get sick so my body tells me lay
[1:01:27] down drink fluids go to bed get some
[1:01:30] rest
[1:01:30] okay so I obey what my body is dictating
[1:01:33] to me I lay down I drink plenty of
[1:01:35] fluids get lots of rest and all of a
[1:01:37] sudden my body has the ability to heal
[1:01:39] itself from within guess how God created
[1:01:41] us
[1:01:42] if I don't listen to what it says I pay
[1:01:44] for it the next day
[1:01:45] but here again God has already created
[1:01:47] God has already made it Satan has put
[1:01:50] the sickness on fine but God is already
[1:01:51] my healer so I thank him for my healing
[1:01:53] but I also have to sometimes I have to
[1:01:55] give my body the rest I have to have to
[1:01:57] allow it to to heal itself
[1:02:00] in the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:02:02] brother brownie says it talks about
[1:02:05] Christ in Christ in the true church he
[1:02:07] says Satan cannot stand it he knows that
[1:02:10] the people get a true revelation of the
[1:02:12] true church and what she is and what she
[1:02:14] stands for she can she can do the
[1:02:17] Greater Works and she will become an
[1:02:18] invincible Army
[1:02:20] Invincible means undefeatable
[1:02:24] so why are we defeated
[1:02:26] because we're not willing to accept Who
[1:02:28] We Are
[1:02:31] what is it that dwells inside of us
[1:02:34] God
[1:02:36] he's not some little wimp
[1:02:38] he's not so little nothing that has is
[1:02:40] afraid of oh no Satan's here again oh no
[1:02:43] I better behave oh no I better back up
[1:02:45] and let oh Hogwarts no
[1:02:48] we have control over him
[1:02:50] we have the ability to fight him
[1:02:53] Jesus could call Ten Thousand Angels
[1:02:56] well we have access to everything that's
[1:02:58] Heaven brother Branham says God brother
[1:03:01] Robin says that God will bankrupt Heaven
[1:03:03] before he'll let out any of his promises
[1:03:04] fall
[1:03:07] so why don't we access it
[1:03:10] I mean why don't we claim who we are why
[1:03:12] don't we exercise The Authority that has
[1:03:14] been given to us by virtue of who we are
[1:03:17] we are his sons and we are his daughter
[1:03:18] and even more than that we are his wife
[1:03:22] I know what somebody attacks my wife
[1:03:24] they have to go through me
[1:03:26] I will defend her
[1:03:28] well what do you think God will do
[1:03:32] Satan's attacking
[1:03:34] um
[1:03:35] he better not attack his wife
[1:03:37] he's got God on his hands
[1:03:40] but we have to believe this
[1:03:42] it doesn't do any good to recite it it
[1:03:44] has to be a reality to uh to us we
[1:03:47] actually have to have the faith to
[1:03:49] believe that the god that is in US is
[1:03:51] has the ability and is willing to go
[1:03:53] into a fight for us to protect us into
[1:03:55] Garden to provide for us we have to
[1:03:58] actually believe this and once you begin
[1:04:00] to believe this once you begin to accept
[1:04:02] it then the party's over then all of a
[1:04:05] sudden Satan comes puts his ugly head up
[1:04:07] and you just come on come on boy I want
[1:04:10] to give you a good one this time I mean
[1:04:12] but this is our rights
[1:04:14] I mean I make it in a humorous thing but
[1:04:16] you get the point why let him defeat us
[1:04:20] we have the authority he's given us that
[1:04:22] Authority
[1:04:25] he said that he said according to the
[1:04:27] message the full maturity the word has
[1:04:29] been restored to us it is full power
[1:04:32] that means everything that God is
[1:04:35] has been restored to us
[1:04:38] God is Not defeatable
[1:04:41] he created everything everything is
[1:04:43] subject to him well if that's the case
[1:04:45] then all of that power has been given
[1:04:47] unto us then why don't we use it why
[1:04:49] don't we exercise it the the only
[1:04:51] balancing thing is that Paul was in one
[1:04:54] place and and there was this lady
[1:04:55] following around and and was prophesying
[1:04:58] you know these guys have come to do this
[1:04:59] and this and this and and but Paul had
[1:05:01] to wait until he had the word from God
[1:05:04] it says now you cast it out
[1:05:06] he couldn't do it right at the beginning
[1:05:09] he had to wait until God gave him the
[1:05:11] command to go ahead and to the cast that
[1:05:13] demon out because it wouldn't have
[1:05:15] happened before then
[1:05:16] brother Bradham you're looking to the
[1:05:19] things that he said when he has a vision
[1:05:20] all of a sudden
[1:05:22] no everything has to be in place
[1:05:25] no this lady has to come in she has to
[1:05:27] be dressed in certain things she has to
[1:05:28] take this hat movement from here over to
[1:05:30] here and she has to take this and push
[1:05:32] this over here and all of a sudden when
[1:05:34] all of her things were all is said in
[1:05:35] places ah now is the time and so then
[1:05:38] I'll then he spoke the word
[1:05:40] but it all had to come in the Todd's
[1:05:43] timing it all had to be the way that God
[1:05:44] had that God had said so the prophet
[1:05:47] I mean what I think you like the
[1:05:49] thinking of David David was fighting the
[1:05:51] Philistines he went out and fought them
[1:05:52] one day and and then the the Philistines
[1:05:55] gathered together again and David says
[1:05:57] should we go out and fight him he says
[1:05:59] no not not a direct assault he said go
[1:06:01] around behind them when you see the wind
[1:06:03] and the mulberry trees he says then you
[1:06:05] attack
[1:06:06] because God had planned
[1:06:08] God knew what he was doing
[1:06:10] but we have to listen to him we have to
[1:06:12] follow his utunction we have to follow
[1:06:14] his leadership
[1:06:26] yeah
[1:06:27] he said what was Jesus manifested for
[1:06:30] to show God
[1:06:32] he was God he had to be no man could die
[1:06:36] or a prophet and no Prophet could he was
[1:06:38] God he was the god of the prophets he
[1:06:41] was the prophets he was the he was the
[1:06:43] Kings he was the history he was all of
[1:06:45] that and throughout that purpose he
[1:06:47] achieved a church that he the fullness
[1:06:50] of God might bring to pass every
[1:06:52] promised word of God in these last days
[1:06:54] when he gets the preeminence that means
[1:06:58] he has to be the leader
[1:07:00] he has to be the one guiding he has to
[1:07:03] be the one that inspires you to be able
[1:07:05] to say the things that he once said
[1:07:07] if you just say it because you want to
[1:07:09] say it I mean I could say well let there
[1:07:11] be snow tomorrow let there be snow
[1:07:12] tomorrow if that isn't the will of God
[1:07:14] it won't snow
[1:07:15] I don't expect snow tomorrow okay
[1:07:19] but would you see what I'm trying to say
[1:07:21] but if all of a sudden God anoints me
[1:07:23] and all of a sudden I call for snow yeah
[1:07:25] get out your shovels
[1:07:27] but I mean but you have to understand it
[1:07:29] has to be God directed brother Bradham
[1:07:32] just couldn't speak the squirrels into
[1:07:34] exist as all of a sudden God had to lead
[1:07:35] him he couldn't give that fish in his
[1:07:37] life until God has spoke to them he said
[1:07:39] give that fish back in his life and all
[1:07:40] of us in the fist you know came back to
[1:07:42] life again
[1:07:43] God had to wait for God to lead him and
[1:07:46] for God to give him the words to say and
[1:07:48] once that once God had directed him then
[1:07:50] it was God it wasn't brother Branham
[1:07:52] speaking well it has to come now in our
[1:07:54] lives where it's the same thing where
[1:07:56] it's no longer us doing but oh it's God
[1:07:58] now doing it through us
[1:08:08] brother Bradham and the United wins at
[1:08:10] the end time he goes and he goes into
[1:08:11] great length
[1:08:13] he says I have no he says I have no more
[1:08:15] to do it with than nothing no no I'm no
[1:08:17] more than just a voice I wasn't the one
[1:08:20] that appeared down the river I was only
[1:08:21] standing there when he appeared I'm not
[1:08:24] the one on the platform these things and
[1:08:26] foretells these things that happens I as
[1:08:29] perfect as they are I'm only the one
[1:08:31] that's near when he does it I was only a
[1:08:34] voice that he raised that he used to say
[1:08:36] it it wasn't what I knew is what it's
[1:08:39] what I just surrendered myself to that
[1:08:42] he spoke to it isn't me it wasn't the
[1:08:45] seventh angel oh no it was the
[1:08:47] manifestation of the Son of God it was
[1:08:49] the it wasn't the angel his messenger it
[1:08:52] was it was the mystery that God unfolded
[1:08:54] it's not a man that's God the angel was
[1:08:57] not the son of man he was the messenger
[1:08:59] from the son of man the son of man is
[1:09:02] Christ he is the one that you're feeding
[1:09:03] on you're not feeding on it on on a man
[1:09:06] uh a man with his words his words will
[1:09:10] fail but you're feeding on the unfailing
[1:09:12] body word of the son of man
[1:09:14] that's the message
[1:09:17] it's not just a man speaking
[1:09:20] it's not just a Kentucky hillbilly
[1:09:23] he yielded himself to God and so God
[1:09:26] could take and speak through him
[1:09:28] and what was he trying to do to the
[1:09:30] bride he was trying to encourage the
[1:09:32] bride except what you are begin to
[1:09:34] understand this is the man this is the
[1:09:36] beauty of the god this is the beauty of
[1:09:39] the message this is the beauty of
[1:09:40] salvation
[1:09:41] God is trying to raise us up out of
[1:09:44] laity and to get us into in Revelations
[1:09:47] 4 1 come up higher I got some things I
[1:09:49] want to show you and then and then do
[1:09:51] without the word has been opened up and
[1:09:53] to us and every time you begin to read
[1:09:55] the word all of a sudden oh that's what
[1:09:57] I am well that's how God does this and
[1:09:59] we begin to relate that to us and our
[1:10:01] lives and the things which we are doing
[1:10:02] and we begin to realize it's not about
[1:10:05] us it's about God and God is wanting
[1:10:07] vessels that he can work through
[1:10:15] and this morning church agency says
[1:10:17] these elect were these elect were not
[1:10:20] only the Eternal thoughts of God which
[1:10:21] were to be expressed in flesh in their
[1:10:23] due season but these elect are called by
[1:10:26] another name now to Abraham and his seed
[1:10:29] were the promises made and he said not
[1:10:30] two seeds as of many but as of one and
[1:10:33] to thy seed which is Christ and of ye be
[1:10:35] Christ then are ye Abraham's seed it
[1:10:37] heirs according to the promise so we
[1:10:39] have to be in Christ in order to be
[1:10:41] Abraham's seed and all the promises
[1:10:43] being able to relate to us how do you
[1:10:45] get into Christ by one Spirit we all
[1:10:47] baptize into the body and into his body
[1:10:50] without the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:10:51] you're on the outside
[1:10:54] you are not reborn until you receive the
[1:10:56] baptism of the Holy Spirit but once
[1:10:59] you've received the baptism in the Holy
[1:11:01] Spirit that's when God himself comes and
[1:11:02] dwells in you and that is the Seal of
[1:11:04] your salvation because once you are
[1:11:06] sealed into salvation he says that's it
[1:11:08] there's no questions any anymore things
[1:11:11] might happen in your life but he says
[1:11:13] once God has come into you and sealed
[1:11:14] you by the baptism in the Holy Spirit
[1:11:16] from that point on your salvation is
[1:11:18] secure
[1:11:22] he said then he goes on not only to
[1:11:24] narrow it down by Netflix but rather to
[1:11:26] finalize it for in Galatians 3 he
[1:11:28] identifies the seed singular with Jesus
[1:11:31] encounter the seed the children the sea
[1:11:33] the sea children as children of Promise
[1:11:35] the promise as having to do with the
[1:11:37] election or the choosing of God and that
[1:11:40] is exactly what we have been saying
[1:11:42] these who are the Royal seed are the
[1:11:44] elect of God they are the predestinated
[1:11:47] foreknown of God and were in the mind of
[1:11:49] God and in his thoughts
[1:11:51] that's who you are
[1:11:55] you are far known of God because you
[1:11:57] were the seed of God because you were
[1:11:58] the seed of God God knew who you were
[1:12:00] and God we're looking for you God was
[1:12:02] always looking for himself
[1:12:04] only only the elect of God can be
[1:12:06] redeemed
[1:12:08] and you're redeemed what does redeem
[1:12:10] mean being brought back being brought
[1:12:12] back into your rightful position with
[1:12:14] God
[1:12:16] in very plain language the too bright of
[1:12:18] Christ then in very plain language the
[1:12:21] true bride of Christ was in the mind of
[1:12:23] God eternally though not expressed until
[1:12:25] each came forth in their designated
[1:12:27] decreed season as each member not as
[1:12:29] each member came forth it became
[1:12:32] expressed and took its place in the body
[1:12:34] thus the bride is the literal spoken
[1:12:37] word seed bride it's very apparent that
[1:12:40] she ought to be called that for she was
[1:12:42] predestinated in him came from the same
[1:12:45] Source was eternal with him and is now
[1:12:48] manifesting God in a many-membered body
[1:12:50] whereas once God was manifested in one
[1:12:53] member Even in our Lord Jesus Christ so
[1:12:55] we have to begin and where do we come
[1:12:57] from what were we always a part of you
[1:13:00] always were a part of God
[1:13:03] that is hard to comprehend
[1:13:05] but it isn't me that I mean this is what
[1:13:09] the word says this is what brother Brown
[1:13:10] got us through the prophet is trying to
[1:13:12] tell us I am a seed of God I always was
[1:13:14] a seed of God I always was a child of
[1:13:16] God but now I have to step into the
[1:13:19] position of being a being that son
[1:13:21] and when I step into the position of
[1:13:22] being sin then all the rights and
[1:13:24] privilege of being a son all of a sudden
[1:13:26] it it it it comes with it
[1:13:28] but then I have to be trained
[1:13:31] I have to be trained how do I use the
[1:13:33] power
[1:13:34] how do I use the authority
[1:13:37] I cannot use it without if I don't have
[1:13:39] the character so God has to develop in
[1:13:41] me the character of Jesus Christ and the
[1:13:43] more of the character of Jesus Christ
[1:13:44] all of a sudden becomes my character
[1:13:46] then all of a sudden more and more he
[1:13:48] can take and he can take the power that
[1:13:50] is rightfully mined by virtue of who I
[1:13:51] am and he can take that power and he can
[1:13:53] let me exercise it
[1:13:56] this is what he had to do in brother
[1:13:57] bradham's life this is what he had to do
[1:13:59] in brother bradham's life in Ministry he
[1:14:01] had God had to trade him God had to
[1:14:02] teach him in fact there was one incident
[1:14:04] where he was sitting there before he had
[1:14:06] the spoken word all of a sudden a couple
[1:14:09] of kids came in and they were sitting on
[1:14:10] the front row and they started making
[1:14:11] love in front of everybody and brother
[1:14:13] Ram says don't do that
[1:14:15] he costed him two or three times and all
[1:14:17] of a sudden and God spoke to him and
[1:14:19] said whatever you say that's what's
[1:14:20] going to happen
[1:14:21] and there's a pause
[1:14:23] brother Brown says I forgive you for
[1:14:25] that
[1:14:27] because he could have smitten them blind
[1:14:29] he could have smitten them dead in fact
[1:14:31] got it the angel had told him but
[1:14:33] previously he said he said there's a
[1:14:34] trap that Satan has laid out for you
[1:14:36] button wouldn't tell him what it was
[1:14:37] well that was the Trap
[1:14:39] and God was trying to God God knew how
[1:14:42] brother Brandon was going to act okay
[1:14:44] but he had to prove to brother Branham
[1:14:46] that you have the character of Jesus
[1:14:48] Christ in you and therefore you will not
[1:14:50] act Accord act in ways which are not
[1:14:52] according to God's purpose and will
[1:14:55] so God has to develop in us the
[1:14:57] character he cannot trust us with he
[1:15:00] cannot trust us with the power until all
[1:15:02] you know until we have the character you
[1:15:04] don't take a three-year-old and give him
[1:15:06] your 44 magnum and said they're here son
[1:15:08] go have some fun
[1:15:09] I mean you know no you have to train him
[1:15:12] okay well God can do can't give us all
[1:15:16] the power that's rightfully ours until
[1:15:17] we have been adequately trained until we
[1:15:19] actually know how to know what to do
[1:15:21] with the power that is rightfully ours
[1:15:24] he said he said now then we're coming to
[1:15:26] a conclusion as the Eternal logos God
[1:15:29] was manifested in the son and then Jesus
[1:15:31] dwelt all the fullness of the godhead
[1:15:33] bodily and that Eternal one was the
[1:15:35] father manifested in flesh and thereby
[1:15:37] gained the title of son so he's talking
[1:15:39] about Jesus Christ he was he was a part
[1:15:41] of God he was the fullness of the God
[1:15:42] and all that stuff then he goes on even
[1:15:44] so we
[1:15:46] so he's taking what Jesus Christ was and
[1:15:49] now he's relaying that to us even so we
[1:15:52] Eternal in his thoughts just as Christ
[1:15:53] was in our turn became the many membered
[1:15:56] spoken word seed manifested in flesh and
[1:15:58] those Eternal thoughts now manifest In
[1:16:00] the Flesh are the sons of God even as we
[1:16:03] are so called we did not become seed by
[1:16:05] the rebirth we were seed and therefore
[1:16:07] were reborn for only the elect can be
[1:16:10] reborn because we were seed is the
[1:16:12] reason we could be quick and in non-seed
[1:16:13] there's nothing to Quicken
[1:16:15] why do you believe the message
[1:16:18] because God's seed was there
[1:16:20] God took that seed and he quickened it
[1:16:22] he brought it to life and over the over
[1:16:25] the course of your life he's been taking
[1:16:26] you and molding you and making you but
[1:16:28] he's bringing us to this a time now
[1:16:32] when the seed that was put in us has to
[1:16:34] come to full manifestation has to come
[1:16:36] to full maturity this is the bride age
[1:16:38] this is where Jesus Christ is going to
[1:16:41] come and so live in the bride until we
[1:16:43] literally we become the manifestation of
[1:16:45] God himself
[1:16:48] and we think well how will I act well
[1:16:50] look at the prophet
[1:16:52] how did he act
[1:16:54] he was still brother Branham
[1:16:56] he still liked to hunt he still like to
[1:16:58] fish he still liked a joke he still like
[1:17:00] to have fun he still like to do okay
[1:17:03] but then when God needed him he was
[1:17:05] there
[1:17:07] well we are we are what we are
[1:17:10] I mean my personality enters into
[1:17:12] everything I preach okay
[1:17:15] I can't help it that's just who I am
[1:17:17] okay but I have a some at least in India
[1:17:20] they say I have a way of making
[1:17:21] something so simple they can everybody
[1:17:23] can understand it well I hope that's
[1:17:26] true but but we have to come down to the
[1:17:28] place we are still us
[1:17:31] but when God wants to use us
[1:17:34] if we can yield ourselves to him in
[1:17:36] spite of our Humanity then God can begin
[1:17:38] to work through us and God can begin to
[1:17:41] manifest himself to us why would I speak
[1:17:43] that to that girl I said don't look at
[1:17:45] the stupidity of the ACT but look at her
[1:17:46] look at her give her her life back that
[1:17:49] was God speaking through me to her God
[1:17:51] gave her her life because I was the
[1:17:53] spoken word to her
[1:17:55] and I was in a miserable Miss I mean my
[1:17:57] mental everything no I was not the one
[1:18:00] you wanted to have pray for me at that
[1:18:02] time I mean I was mad I was upset I was
[1:18:04] frustrated okay
[1:18:06] All of My Flesh was there
[1:18:09] but God looked past all of that he
[1:18:11] managed in spite of all of that he
[1:18:12] managed to go ahead and and and take me
[1:18:15] and actually even in that state he he
[1:18:18] was able actually to speak through me
[1:18:20] and give life to that child
[1:18:23] so it doesn't matter your mental state
[1:18:25] you don't have to be super spiritual you
[1:18:27] don't have to be living with angels and
[1:18:29] flying around in heaven no you you just
[1:18:32] you
[1:18:33] but if you can take you and give it to
[1:18:35] God
[1:18:37] and let God use you he will do things
[1:18:39] through you that you could not even
[1:18:41] begin to imagine
[1:18:43] he said now then we're coming to a
[1:18:45] conclusion
[1:18:46] as Eternal logos God was manifesting the
[1:18:49] son and and and Jesus throughout all the
[1:18:52] fullness of the godhead bodily and that
[1:18:54] Eternal one was the father manifested in
[1:18:56] flesh and thereby again I guess I read
[1:18:58] that yeah
[1:18:59] so hold this carefully in mind he says
[1:19:01] now take the next step
[1:19:03] redeem means to buy back it restores to
[1:19:07] the original owner God by his death he
[1:19:10] the shed blood he brought back his own
[1:19:12] he brought back the first spoken word
[1:19:14] seed bride my sheep hear my voice and
[1:19:17] they follow me you always worship you
[1:19:20] never were a pig or a dog turned into a
[1:19:22] sheep that's impossible for every kind
[1:19:24] of Life produced of the same kind and
[1:19:26] there's no change in species as we were
[1:19:28] in the thoughts of God and then ex and
[1:19:30] then expressed in flesh there had to
[1:19:32] come a time a day when we would hear his
[1:19:34] voice the word and hearing that voice
[1:19:36] become aware of our father calling us
[1:19:38] and recognize that we are sons of God
[1:19:43] so we've heard it through the prophet
[1:19:45] but now it has to become a reality
[1:19:49] and that's where that's where the
[1:19:51] problem comes
[1:19:52] I'm told that when you take when you
[1:19:55] take an engineer and he goes to a to a
[1:19:57] new to a new business sometimes they
[1:19:59] will give them a project which
[1:20:01] um nobody else has been able to solve
[1:20:03] because they weren't told it can't be
[1:20:05] solved so they'll work on it and they'll
[1:20:07] work on it and they'll come up with an
[1:20:08] answer when all the other people
[1:20:10] couldn't
[1:20:11] why because you work you you you weren't
[1:20:13] told that it can't be to be solved you
[1:20:15] weren't told that it was impossible
[1:20:18] well
[1:20:19] God will take us and me we might think
[1:20:20] well this is impossible
[1:20:22] but when you're relying upon yourself
[1:20:24] yeah it is
[1:20:25] but if you look to God
[1:20:28] and begin to realize you have the answer
[1:20:30] and then God directs I know this one
[1:20:33] brother he works and he does metal
[1:20:34] fabricating
[1:20:36] and all of a sudden there was a problem
[1:20:37] came in the guy wanted something
[1:20:39] fabricated and he thought and he thought
[1:20:41] and he thought and finally he just kind
[1:20:43] of gave up and he went to you know went
[1:20:44] home went to bed and then at night all
[1:20:46] of a sudden if weenie wakes up in the
[1:20:48] morning that's how to do it then he goes
[1:20:52] back to the shop and all of a sudden
[1:20:54] they tell them yeah why didn't we think
[1:20:56] of that that's so simple
[1:20:58] but here again he had to get away from
[1:21:00] himself
[1:21:02] and he had to simmer himself down so God
[1:21:04] could speak
[1:21:05] and often that's the way it is in our
[1:21:07] lives we have to let God in we have to
[1:21:10] let his thoughts become our thought we
[1:21:11] have we have to let him guide and
[1:21:13] direction so that we can do the things
[1:21:15] that that he wants done
[1:21:18] and the God who is rich in Mercy says
[1:21:20] I'm only saying this not to mix up
[1:21:22] Doctrine but just straighten it out that
[1:21:23] we might get away from this fear and
[1:21:25] despair you don't know who you are you
[1:21:27] are not going to be but now you are the
[1:21:30] sons of God so you always were sons of
[1:21:32] God when God had you in his thinking at
[1:21:34] the beginning you have to be some part
[1:21:36] of you your life that's in you now had
[1:21:38] to be with God and from in the beginning
[1:21:51] in one place we we talk about faith
[1:21:55] and brother Branham uses his example and
[1:21:58] I've used it a few times overseas
[1:22:01] brother Branham talks about we have to
[1:22:03] come up to having Supreme faith
[1:22:07] and we talk about faith as one thing
[1:22:09] Supreme
[1:22:10] oh my how are we going to have Supreme
[1:22:13] faith and brother Brown says uh we'll
[1:22:17] all paraphrase he says if you have a car
[1:22:20] you go out and take the key stick it in
[1:22:23] the ignition turn it you expect it to
[1:22:25] start
[1:22:26] because it always starts
[1:22:29] there's no question
[1:22:31] well it's going to start because it
[1:22:32] always starts
[1:22:34] you walk into a room and it's dark you
[1:22:36] really feel around flip on the light
[1:22:38] switch
[1:22:39] you expect light
[1:22:42] it always comes right there's no
[1:22:44] question
[1:22:45] there's no frustrating
[1:22:47] you don't call up your pastor I'm going
[1:22:49] to turn on my lights I'm going to turn
[1:22:50] on my lights pray pray pray pray
[1:22:52] no you just go and flip the light switch
[1:22:54] and then you go on which business
[1:22:57] now that's the way it has to be with us
[1:22:59] and God
[1:23:01] where there's no question
[1:23:03] well God your word said so
[1:23:05] so it has to be
[1:23:07] okay we accept it we prayed we accepted
[1:23:10] okay God now it's Europe you you are
[1:23:13] obligated to your word brother Brown
[1:23:14] says that you're not obligated to me
[1:23:16] you're obligated to your word so if I
[1:23:20] take your word and and I sit there and I
[1:23:22] remind you of your word and I claim that
[1:23:24] promise that you've given in your word
[1:23:25] then now you're under under obligation
[1:23:28] to fulfill your word in my life
[1:23:31] and then we place it on him
[1:23:34] sure he can do whatever he wants he may
[1:23:37] not do it the right then but he will
[1:23:41] because he said he would
[1:23:43] I mean there's no question here but see
[1:23:45] this is where we have this is where
[1:23:47] brother Bradham raced in his life he had
[1:23:49] a vision that was the end of the
[1:23:51] argument he knew it's going to happen
[1:23:52] because God gave him the vision and he
[1:23:54] always knew the Visions never failed
[1:23:56] then when he got to the place where of
[1:23:58] discernment he could look in the pack in
[1:24:00] their life he could look for me if God
[1:24:01] would show them the future he could see
[1:24:03] them doing the things that they normally
[1:24:04] would do as a child or whatever the
[1:24:06] situation is and he knew God had healed
[1:24:08] him
[1:24:09] and others he says now according to your
[1:24:11] faith
[1:24:12] and you know it's it's interesting with
[1:24:14] healing
[1:24:16] some people had followed had followed
[1:24:18] Jesus Christ to where he was staying
[1:24:21] I think they were lepers that could have
[1:24:23] been blind I forget which one it was
[1:24:25] and finally they hate brother Jesus
[1:24:27] Christ everybody says do you believe I
[1:24:29] can do this
[1:24:31] well yeah we believe you can do that
[1:24:34] he said in according to your faith
[1:24:35] that's what you can receive
[1:24:37] and they went they went away and all of
[1:24:41] a sudden according to their faith they
[1:24:42] were healed and you know that is the
[1:24:44] only stipulation
[1:24:46] there's no other stipulation it isn't
[1:24:49] how often you go to church do you pay
[1:24:50] your tithes you do this and this and
[1:24:51] this and this this this no do you
[1:24:53] believe it
[1:24:54] if you can believe it I will do it
[1:24:58] it's that simple we make it difficult we
[1:25:01] make it complicated it's not it's the
[1:25:04] Simplicity of the Gospel it's the
[1:25:06] Simplicity of taking God at his word and
[1:25:09] believing whatever God has said that is
[1:25:11] what God will do because he's God he
[1:25:14] cannot lie
[1:25:15] that's one thing he cannot do he cannot
[1:25:17] lie and once he's in once he's made a
[1:25:20] promise then he's obligated to that
[1:25:22] promise he's obligated to do what his
[1:25:24] word says he would do and that's where
[1:25:26] we have to come in our relationship
[1:25:31] I know I personally I know that I'm a
[1:25:33] son of God
[1:25:34] 's revealed that to me
[1:25:36] I don't doubt that I don't question that
[1:25:39] because God revealed that to me
[1:25:41] I know I am the righteousness of God
[1:25:43] himself
[1:25:44] because the word says I am
[1:25:47] okay do I have faults and failures you
[1:25:50] betcha but am I the righteousness of God
[1:25:52] I sure am in the eyes of God that's how
[1:25:55] I stand
[1:25:56] there's no question on that because
[1:25:57] that's what the word declares that I am
[1:26:01] I know that I am a sinless before God
[1:26:03] why because I am in Christ
[1:26:05] Christ doesn't God doesn't see me he
[1:26:07] sees the sacrifice because he looks at
[1:26:09] the sacrifice he has to declare me
[1:26:11] righteous he has to declare me sinless
[1:26:13] because the sacrifice with the
[1:26:15] propitiation for my sins and therefore I
[1:26:17] before God I am sinless before God I am
[1:26:19] righteous because he says that I am and
[1:26:22] is merely taking him at his word and and
[1:26:24] believing it now if you believe that you
[1:26:27] will live like it
[1:26:30] okay
[1:26:31] you can't say you know I am the
[1:26:33] righteousness of God and you go out
[1:26:34] there the beer joints and all the other
[1:26:35] kind of stuff and sin and living no no
[1:26:38] no no if there's no conversion
[1:26:40] if there's no change in life there is no
[1:26:43] conversion but once you've accepted
[1:26:46] Jesus Christ as your savior and once you
[1:26:48] realize the magnitude of the love that
[1:26:49] he expressed to you at Calvary
[1:26:52] then you will respond in love
[1:26:55] you know it's interesting when somebody
[1:26:56] asks asked um they ask Jesus Christ what
[1:27:00] is the greatest of all the Commandments
[1:27:02] Jesus says well that's simple you love
[1:27:04] God with your whole heart soul mind body
[1:27:07] and spirit
[1:27:08] and the same is like unto the same
[1:27:09] you'll love your neighbor as yourself
[1:27:11] and these two Commandments rest all the
[1:27:13] laws and the prophets
[1:27:15] and this message what is the message
[1:27:17] love God with everything that's within
[1:27:19] you fall in love so I'm in love with him
[1:27:21] and and him until you're willing to do
[1:27:23] everything that he says and everything
[1:27:24] he guides and everything directs because
[1:27:26] if you love him and you love your
[1:27:28] neighbors yourself he says you've
[1:27:29] already fulfilled all the laws and the
[1:27:31] Commandments and from that point on then
[1:27:33] God can begin to lead you and he can
[1:27:35] begin to guide you and he can begin to
[1:27:36] to to to to to to direct direct your
[1:27:39] lives
[1:27:47] the people the people that were that
[1:27:50] came out of Egypt
[1:27:52] God performed miracles
[1:27:54] God showed his mighty hand
[1:27:57] he brought plagues upon Egypt
[1:28:00] so that they could see this is who I am
[1:28:03] I am God
[1:28:05] and there's nothing can stand before me
[1:28:08] he went they came into Mount Sinai
[1:28:10] Mighty manifestation of God Thunders and
[1:28:13] Lightnings and earthquakes
[1:28:15] and voice of God sounded like a trumpet
[1:28:17] and everybody's ran because they were
[1:28:19] scared
[1:28:20] and God why did God do that God did that
[1:28:23] so that they would fear Him and out of
[1:28:26] fear they would they would they would
[1:28:28] keep his law
[1:28:30] fear is a very poor motivator
[1:28:33] why don't we go 80 miles an hour down
[1:28:36] the freeway
[1:28:37] because these are guys with blue lights
[1:28:39] and they don't like you going 80 miles
[1:28:40] an hour down the freeway
[1:28:42] so they will stop you and they will give
[1:28:44] you a little citation and it'll cost you
[1:28:46] a few things
[1:28:47] okay
[1:28:49] but if if
[1:28:52] when God shows his love to you
[1:28:55] and then God himself comes and lives
[1:28:58] inside of you he changes your nature we
[1:29:00] are not under law we are under Grace
[1:29:02] Grace does not give us a license to sin
[1:29:05] Grace gives us the freedom to worship
[1:29:07] because under grace we can open up our
[1:29:09] hearts to God we can sit there and enter
[1:29:11] into his presence because we know that
[1:29:13] we are the very righteousness of God
[1:29:14] himself because we are in Jesus Christ
[1:29:16] and because we love him we automatically
[1:29:19] will do the things that he's wanting for
[1:29:20] us to do and he and under the New
[1:29:23] Covenant he says I'm going to take my
[1:29:24] law and put it in their hearts and in
[1:29:25] their minds basically we will take on
[1:29:27] the very nature of God himself We Will
[1:29:30] We Will obey it because it's our nature
[1:29:32] to do so we will be we will obey God
[1:29:34] because of the love that we have for him
[1:29:36] and so love is a greater motivator than
[1:29:39] anything else we could have
[1:29:41] why why does the husband love their
[1:29:43] wives why are they say truthful to their
[1:29:44] to their wives and vice versa because
[1:29:47] it's the love bond between you that
[1:29:49] keeps you the way that you are
[1:29:52] well it's our love relationship with
[1:29:54] Jesus Christ he says if you love me
[1:29:56] you'll do the things that I ask you to
[1:29:58] do not out of a demand not out of if you
[1:30:01] don't do this I'm going to you know
[1:30:03] brother because
[1:30:04] here again if we if we can fall in love
[1:30:07] with Jesus Christ
[1:30:09] where he literally becomes the focus of
[1:30:12] Our Lives
[1:30:13] where we love him more than we love life
[1:30:15] itself
[1:30:16] and we we would want we would not want
[1:30:18] to do anything that he would find
[1:30:20] offensive
[1:30:21] then all of a sudden we will live a life
[1:30:22] of Holiness we will live a life of
[1:30:24] Purity we will do the things which we
[1:30:26] which we are expected to do as
[1:30:28] Christians not because of law
[1:30:30] but out of love
[1:30:32] God bless you
[1:30:38] thank you
[1:30:41] God bless you
[1:30:56] yes
[1:30:58] yes
