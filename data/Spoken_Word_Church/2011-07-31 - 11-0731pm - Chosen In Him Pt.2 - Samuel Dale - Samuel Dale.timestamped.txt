[26:27] the weekend to preach for her story just
[26:29] keep these in your prayers and the Lord
[26:31] would would be with each one all right
[26:35] let's turn back where we were reading in
[26:38] Ephesians
[26:40] and we'll try to continue on what we
[26:42] were doing this morning and move right
[26:45] on into the the message so remember that
[26:48] the last you still got a few more tests
[26:51] and things to go through to get
[26:52] everything cleared up the Lord will take
[26:54] care of everything because we believe it
[26:57] and just
[27:00] Ephesians 1 father we thank you
[27:05] most of all because you are our father
[27:08] that way then we know who truly we are
[27:13] and as the prophet said there
[27:16] that he was no longer the son of Charles
[27:18] another Branham he wouldn't denying his
[27:19] mother and father
[27:21] you've just come to realize who he
[27:23] really was and
[27:24] what was taking place
[27:26] so we just ask you now to help us here
[27:28] to understand and let that understanding
[27:31] come to our hearts and our lives
[27:33] forgive our sins
[27:35] as we read your word Lord you come and
[27:38] speak to us the biggest sin that we need
[27:40] to be forgiven of is in any way that we
[27:42] would try to put our thoughts or ideas
[27:44] into your word
[27:47] and to change it to fit something we
[27:49] think
[27:50] we love you and we thank you and just
[27:52] have your way now and keep us in Jesus
[27:55] name
[27:56] amen
[28:00] we've read this enough until everybody
[28:01] ought to be recorded by memory I guess
[28:05] this should be the God and Father
[28:08] of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed
[28:10] us with all spiritual blessings in
[28:12] Heavenly places where in Christ
[28:15] according as he had chosen Us in him
[28:18] before the foundation of the world that
[28:21] we should be holding Without Blame
[28:22] before him in love having predestinated
[28:25] us unto the adoption of children by
[28:27] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[28:30] good pleasure of his will to the praise
[28:32] of the glory of his grace wherein he
[28:35] hath made us accepted in the Beloved you
[28:39] may be seated the Lord had this blessing
[28:41] to the reading of the word
[28:45] to make wood together at these these are
[28:48] the ones in case somebody didn't get one
[28:50] this morning you know a thing but
[28:59] I hope you
[29:02] you know
[29:04] understood what I was trying to get
[29:05] across this morning
[29:07] and as I've always said to you I don't
[29:10] ask anybody to believe what I say
[29:14] not my wife not my children
[29:17] or anybody I ask you to take what is
[29:21] being said
[29:22] and you know go home and pray
[29:28] for God to reveal it to you because I
[29:31] cannot reveal it in that way then you
[29:34] know it's up to the Lord to reveal his
[29:37] word but I'm not concerned because it
[29:40] will be revealed to those that it's
[29:42] supposed to be and to those that it's
[29:45] not supposed to be revealed to it will
[29:47] not and I didn't make that choosing
[29:49] you know uh Rabbi Rich when I believe
[29:52] was the one
[29:54] that made a statement that was
[29:55] outstanding on those videos that he made
[29:57] he said you know we didn't choose to be
[30:00] the people of God talking about Israel
[30:02] he said we didn't choose to be that
[30:06] he said
[30:08] he chose us
[30:10] well now I want you to get this locked
[30:13] into your mind this afternoon
[30:17] did she did Jesus
[30:22] choose to be God
[30:27] or was he God Amen
[30:33] did uh
[30:35] John the Baptist
[30:39] choose
[30:41] to be the Forerunner
[30:43] of the Messiah
[30:46] did Moses choose to
[30:50] you know be the one to deliver the
[30:53] children of Israel
[30:56] or was that for ordained for somebody to
[30:59] be
[31:01] and that those people wound up being
[31:03] that
[31:05] now remember in keeping your mind that
[31:07] we're trying to use a Point as I said
[31:10] that we are
[31:12] we are time creatures
[31:16] trying to understand
[31:19] an eternal situation
[31:23] that's where the trouble's at see that's
[31:25] that's what makes it um you know go
[31:27] wrong that we're trying to comprehend
[31:30] and to do that we must first start with
[31:33] this thing we call the mind the brain
[31:36] the mind you know
[31:37] and
[31:39] naturally that's where Satan battled
[31:42] that
[31:44] is in the mind if they were some way to
[31:47] take my thoughts and transmit them
[31:50] straight into your inner being
[31:52] of say the soul
[31:54] of the person then you wouldn't have any
[31:57] trouble uh comprehending what I'm trying
[32:01] to say
[32:02] and see that's the way it's always been
[32:05] you know God has always had to deal with
[32:08] the carnal mind of man that's why he
[32:11] said it is the enmity they're in Genesis
[32:14] right off you know
[32:16] enmity which means division but the
[32:18] carnal mind has always been division
[32:20] it's never been it runs that's why the
[32:23] imagination of man's mind or heart or
[32:26] whatever you'd read in Genesis is
[32:28] continually evil and uh it's always been
[32:31] that way because that's Satan's approach
[32:35] it's true that but see God has to
[32:37] approach the same way
[32:39] and and don't ask me how he gets through
[32:42] to speak to us
[32:45] you know because we're born doubters
[32:47] right I mean that's just their makeup
[32:50] we're born skeptic afraid
[32:54] uh you know we run around and said it's
[32:57] hard to get one man to believe another
[32:59] man
[33:00] that's that's just normal that's you
[33:02] know because that's that's the part of
[33:04] it but you know if we could ever get and
[33:08] I believe that one day when this is over
[33:10] with I don't believe we would just use a
[33:12] thought transmit to each other you know
[33:14] in heaven I believe we'll talk
[33:17] but it will be on the scale of thought
[33:20] transmitting because that way you won't
[33:23] misunderstand as we were using the other
[33:25] day that Jesus said to Peter some of
[33:28] them you know what is it to thee if John
[33:29] bites like home
[33:32] and saying went out from them not on
[33:35] everybody else from all the disciples
[33:37] that John wasn't going to die
[33:40] no John in his writing he said how be it
[33:44] he didn't say that
[33:47] he said what is it if it if he does
[33:50] see and we try to to comprehend so the
[33:54] only thing that I ask you to do is
[33:56] listen
[33:58] and then go back and listen over to the
[34:00] tapes again and you know and make sure
[34:04] that you get my under my point of what
[34:07] I'm trying to say to you
[34:09] all right because there's no need of me
[34:12] speaking unless you speak I mean I'm
[34:13] gonna get somebody else to speak if
[34:15] you're not going to listen to what I'm
[34:16] trying to say you know uh on that basis
[34:19] but you know I I have a thought in mind
[34:23] and a hard way to get to the thought
[34:25] because you can say well just go ahead
[34:26] and say it okay I said we were chosen
[34:28] than him
[34:29] what does that mean
[34:32] as I said this morning what does that
[34:34] mean to the human mind
[34:36] the human mind will translate that
[34:39] through the conscience and
[34:40] subconsciousness of the human being and
[34:43] we will come out to the bases of sin we
[34:45] were chosen by him
[34:49] and then we will try to divide or
[34:51] understand or try to you know to
[34:54] separate well why did he choose or or
[34:57] why did he choose or who did he choose
[34:59] or how was it done see we'll get all of
[35:03] that involved
[35:04] and then you know we won't have the
[35:07] right understanding and just saying what
[35:09] the Bible says
[35:12] yeah I have a lot of questions wrote
[35:13] down here on the back of this if I can
[35:15] get to them after a while I love
[35:16] questions myself you know
[35:19] I'll split it like this
[35:24] when were we chosen we were chosen to
[35:26] him
[35:30] when was he chosen
[35:34] and who done the choosing
[35:39] because if if we were chosen
[35:43] let me somebody shows right
[35:47] sexual
[35:48] somebody chose or it wouldn't have said
[35:50] that we were chosen in him well who's
[35:53] the hymn
[35:55] and what's it talking about see we got a
[35:58] lot of things to do in a long way to go
[36:00] and uh you you just forgive me
[36:04] all right we covered this morning just a
[36:06] little bit and I want to say it's the
[36:08] word to word that'll keep us into the
[36:11] line
[36:14] I believe the stage we are at now in the
[36:17] uh adoption is in the stage of the
[36:22] manifestation of the Sons and Daughters
[36:24] of God all right
[36:25] and in that is to
[36:28] try to make God known because manifest
[36:31] is the word to be made known so you know
[36:35] we try to make him known
[36:38] through speaking to you then he will
[36:41] make us known
[36:42] by whatever he desires to the signs of
[36:44] Wonders or whatever takes place it will
[36:47] be what he wants us to be and uh you
[36:51] know we're in the place of trying to
[36:54] get our understanding open to the
[36:57] scriptures
[36:59] to where that God can reveal that
[37:03] and I keep referring back to the
[37:05] disciples see he opened their
[37:07] understanding of the scriptures that
[37:09] didn't give them eternal life
[37:12] it was opening them to see that what he
[37:16] was going to do and had been doing and
[37:18] was taking place that was what was open
[37:20] all right but then on the day of
[37:22] Pentecost
[37:24] that was opened and the Bible would say
[37:27] then that even you know let's see you
[37:30] bring you remembers whatsoever are
[37:32] things I said
[37:33] and teach you things to come and run
[37:36] around City not only opened their
[37:38] understanding of what he had said to
[37:41] them
[37:43] right
[37:44] he opened their understanding of things
[37:47] to come all right John goes to Patmos
[37:50] John gets the future John goes see if
[37:52] you're dealing with nothing but John
[37:54] still it does go through that he does
[37:57] even teach more things than what he was
[37:59] actually teaching himself all right
[38:02] because what I want is the word to be
[38:05] alive right
[38:07] and you know for him to make it alive to
[38:11] us and then in doing that then we won't
[38:14] have to worry about anything else is the
[38:16] reveal word okay now let's try to pick
[38:18] back up where we were this morning
[38:20] and we ended up talking about the little
[38:22] drawing that I made to give us a
[38:25] comprehension of of a point of what I
[38:28] was trying to make and you know this is
[38:30] on the internet system and and I don't
[38:32] know
[38:34] I don't know where we could get a root
[38:35] you know we're doing on this I don't
[38:37] know but we'll read it off but to get it
[38:40] on the video part or if if you would
[38:42] take it and hold it kind of in front of
[38:44] it and let you know and give people a
[38:46] chance to read and see that well I'll
[38:48] just hold it up and let them see that we
[38:50] did make a point all right I hope it
[38:53] gets on the video clear it up enough to
[38:55] to
[38:57] there's some things on each side of it
[38:59] and then when you do you could back it
[39:00] up on your computer and see what it is
[39:02] or your internet system we make a little
[39:05] drawing to show that there were things
[39:07] that
[39:09] we put out eternity and then put a space
[39:12] in the Middle with lines calling it a
[39:14] beginning
[39:15] and then we come over into what is time
[39:19] all right now in that
[39:23] we talked about what was back in
[39:26] eternity
[39:27] we'll try to pick that part up right
[39:29] there and start with it
[39:32] we find that he was Elohim self-existing
[39:36] before there was a moon stars whatever
[39:39] anything he was self-existing all right
[39:42] and in him were attributes
[39:47] and those attributes were his thoughts
[39:51] and as I gave you this morning everyone
[39:54] called it even his nature
[39:57] me of what he is you know and in him
[40:01] with attributes to be a savior to be a
[40:03] Healer to be all of those things and
[40:05] brother Brown said and we see those
[40:07] things displayed but my point has always
[40:10] been to you he never gained attributes
[40:13] by coming here
[40:15] time never never made another attribute
[40:18] of God
[40:19] I'm on I'm only displayed those
[40:23] attributes of healer savior you know
[40:25] deliver
[40:26] Etc that's when we got over into what we
[40:29] call the time belt of doing and uh you
[40:34] know
[40:36] but
[40:38] we look back and we've seen that there
[40:40] was
[40:43] that God had foreknowledge
[40:46] all right
[40:48] all right we covered and don't forget I
[40:51] still believe what I believe about
[40:52] predestination what I call it I believe
[40:55] that God he predestinated by
[40:59] foreknowledge all right so for knowledge
[41:02] was first
[41:03] and foreknowledge is knowledge of
[41:08] what we're doing here
[41:11] that's four knowledge
[41:13] so he knew or else he's not gone he'd be
[41:16] like us he knew what we would do every
[41:19] night that would bet its own how much
[41:21] Tyler it would make all of those things
[41:22] we could go through to prove the point
[41:24] that you're to be able to believe it
[41:27] and then by his foreknowledge he could
[41:31] predestinate right
[41:33] so then he would be doing that now these
[41:36] are the words that's a part of him back
[41:38] there see attributes for knowledge
[41:42] predestination is back there
[41:47] and he could stand back there and look
[41:49] all the way through and see everything
[41:52] day every time of what it would be upon
[41:55] Earth and he could predetermine then
[41:59] what everything would be
[42:02] and he would predetermine it by looking
[42:04] at what we would accept or what we would
[42:07] do
[42:08] so that way he's not a respecter of
[42:11] persons and you can't condemn him you
[42:13] know or saying that he never gave you a
[42:15] choice
[42:18] all right
[42:21] but then we got down to the point here
[42:23] of talking about
[42:26] you know being chosen in him
[42:31] let's let's cover these others a little
[42:33] bit before we get back to that
[42:36] it's easy for us to comprehend because
[42:38] of Revelations what is 13 8 that our
[42:41] names were written in the lounge book of
[42:43] life before the foundation of the world
[42:45] you know
[42:46] and uh then we would have to come over
[42:49] here into life and we would appear and
[42:53] then you know we would come to a
[42:56] realization about our name being written
[42:58] in the Book of Life while we're over
[43:01] here in time all right so then your name
[43:03] would become on the book
[43:06] and brother random actually says your
[43:08] name goes on the book it's
[43:09] sanctification
[43:11] see so there's a lot about those things
[43:13] that we need to understand
[43:15] all right we talk about uh justification
[43:21] now justification is the word that we
[43:25] start off with that it's repentance for
[43:28] what you do and God chops off your past
[43:30] then the next is the part that to you
[43:34] know that uh it's as though you never
[43:37] done it which means you've done it but
[43:39] it was watched like clean everything was
[43:40] made and then you come to the place that
[43:43] the real you never did do it now there's
[43:45] justification that was back there
[43:48] real you never sinned right
[43:53] he said wait a minute they did in the
[43:54] garden I didn't say that and I said the
[43:56] real you that's right
[43:58] the garden is over here in time over
[44:00] here on this side I mean these are the
[44:03] things that are back dark
[44:06] in job we read about the sons of God you
[44:09] know morning Stars saying together and
[44:12] sons of God shouted for joy and we know
[44:14] that the prophet said that that was when
[44:17] they saw the Plan of Redemption coming
[44:21] into view
[44:25] but we don't believe in
[44:28] being people
[44:32] standing back there
[44:34] right you know
[44:35] choosing and whatsoever right
[44:38] through it in his mind amen all right
[44:41] and we think of that point and we hold
[44:43] that and that's fine
[44:46] but he did ask the question
[44:49] he asked Joe
[44:51] he said
[44:53] explain it to me
[44:55] in other words paraphrasing it all right
[44:57] he said Joe
[45:00] would you mind explaining to me
[45:04] where you were and what was going on
[45:07] and how I done what I've done
[45:13] please explain it
[45:15] when she brought around said my all
[45:17] mankind has tried to find that answer
[45:22] or where were you
[45:25] when this took place
[45:28] right
[45:30] I Believe by what we're talking about
[45:32] now we can see that not only do we have
[45:35] the revealed word which is the prophet
[45:37] said we have the devil's answer
[45:40] the devil's answer is the revealed word
[45:42] amen that is what will conquer him all
[45:46] right but we have the answer of to job
[45:50] where were we
[45:53] if we'll get it in the right order
[45:56] do you believe in pre-existence brother
[45:58] Dale
[45:59] I believe in pre-existence of almighty
[46:02] God
[46:04] but not of mortal human people
[46:09] because that would be the Mormon
[46:11] doctrine of pre-existence even you went
[46:13] back and said pre-existence to souls and
[46:15] and things like that all right
[46:18] now on this other side back in eternity
[46:22] we know that the seed our word of God
[46:28] come from God predestinated eternally
[46:34] the prophet says not the person see the
[46:37] human that become predestinated
[46:39] eternally
[46:41] see that's about foreknowledge
[46:43] but he said the word our seed come
[46:45] predestinated eternally from God
[46:48] all right now as I asked a question a
[46:51] moment ago
[46:53] did Jesus choose to be God
[46:57] to fulfill the word or was he God
[47:02] our minds will say he was God and then
[47:06] our conscience will say he chose
[47:08] something
[47:11] there was going to be a forerunner as I
[47:14] said of John the Baptist now I gave you
[47:16] these quotes there's no message I gave
[47:17] you today there was going to be a
[47:19] forerunner of the Lord Jesus Christ
[47:23] predestinated for ordained Eternal in
[47:26] the word the city would come
[47:28] so somebody had to be that
[47:33] did they have a choice
[47:38] now over here in the life that we're
[47:40] living
[47:42] it says to brother Branham
[47:45] Danny Henry told interpretation
[47:48] because of the choice that you made
[47:50] which is my choice
[47:52] a great portion of Heaven awaits for you
[47:55] amen so over here in time we have
[47:57] something to do with it
[47:59] uh who is it Joe Joe no wait a minute no
[48:02] Jonah Jonah let me get my stories right
[48:04] Jonah
[48:06] he got
[48:07] all and he went over and told them to
[48:09] destroy that place and God didn't
[48:11] destroy it
[48:13] and he sits down over that boy he has
[48:15] him a pity party as we call it caught
[48:18] him at all upset at God
[48:22] but God had to come down the street and
[48:23] they'll go out just a little bit join a
[48:26] few times
[48:26] and when he got him straightened out he
[48:28] could see that that was God's
[48:31] predestinated
[48:32] Eternal plan
[48:36] somebody had to do it man
[48:39] Jonah was the one that was used to do it
[48:42] yeah
[48:43] so don't never forget as I were trying
[48:45] to explain this morning we'll get back
[48:47] to it in a minute
[48:49] we do have something to do with life on
[48:52] this side
[48:54] even though he has chosen us
[48:57] we must choose him
[49:03] the prophet never done away with those
[49:05] things you see that's what we're trying
[49:07] in our mind to do all right brother
[49:10] random Christ The Mystery of God reveal
[49:11] 1617 right in there he said God had a
[49:15] plan
[49:20] and a purpose
[49:23] he said and he was going to see it
[49:26] achieved
[49:30] in other words there wasn't no way to
[49:32] change it
[49:36] it was the plan
[49:38] he had a purpose to unveil himself
[49:43] for us to understand him
[49:47] see then all of these things that we
[49:50] talk about sure they were back there but
[49:52] they relate over into here
[49:56] we say that and we'll get back to it
[49:58] later in another message but those who
[50:00] Justified he's already glorified
[50:02] all right that's already done that was
[50:05] done back in eternity
[50:07] but we must come down in life
[50:11] and come through the existence of life
[50:15] and then in the existence of life then
[50:17] we realize what glorification is talking
[50:20] about
[50:22] and then we can come to a place to be
[50:25] changed amen right so don't ever forget
[50:28] to message I preached 20 years ago I
[50:31] guess
[50:31] Brother Ray probably gave you the dates
[50:33] on it but I called it a series called
[50:35] matching pieces
[50:37] all right
[50:39] and uh
[50:40] because he's taking them off and putting
[50:42] them back into the tape form we can use
[50:43] here you see matching pieces to me was
[50:46] that
[50:48] whatever is was in heaven in God's mind
[50:52] must come to a situation upon Earth to
[50:56] be that amen
[50:58] and when God saw that the judge shall
[51:01] live by faith was going to strike the
[51:03] world the message he had Martin Luther
[51:06] ready
[51:08] to bring the message
[51:10] because that would be the matching
[51:13] pieces and when you and I come to the
[51:15] place that all of these this word is
[51:17] revealed as we were talking about this
[51:18] morning the fully matured word when it's
[51:21] finished then we've got to leave there's
[51:23] nowhere else to go right right all right
[51:28] now
[51:29] I want to get into this then
[51:32] of chosen in him
[51:36] in a
[51:40] I I want to just keep that talk
[51:46] how could he choose you
[51:50] without being a respecter person
[51:57] all right
[52:00] how can God choose you me you know we're
[52:03] talking to us
[52:04] I like that bus you know
[52:09] how could he choose us
[52:13] without being a respective person
[52:14] because that's been the argument of
[52:16] predestination over mankind you know all
[52:20] right
[52:21] now we can try to to Fathom it and it's
[52:24] good and don't throw it away because
[52:26] it's still part of the Bible that we can
[52:29] look at it as a foreknowledge point
[52:32] that he sees what choice you'll make
[52:38] and then he can predestinate
[52:41] according to the choice you made well
[52:44] that's now don't lose that that's that
[52:47] that's still good
[52:49] but
[52:54] we were we chosen in him
[52:58] or by him
[53:03] if we were chosen by him
[53:07] then he's a respect to a person
[53:12] okay so we you know we're going through
[53:15] the uh the process of elimination all
[53:18] right
[53:18] get rid of that one
[53:20] you know you multiple choice your kids
[53:22] taking school you know you got five you
[53:24] got a question that's got four answers
[53:26] well there's two of them ain't worth
[53:27] nothing they ain't even close to nothing
[53:28] so you just ask them two out and forget
[53:30] them don't even think about them right
[53:33] so then you got two and you got a choice
[53:35] between and you you got to decide from
[53:37] that huh now
[53:42] if we say
[53:46] that he chose me
[53:50] because he seen that I would choose him
[53:57] does that wear a mine's locked
[54:02] Okay click it
[54:05] because if we do that
[54:07] then it would be our choice
[54:12] it would not be his choice
[54:15] now you don't understand brother Dale he
[54:17] chose me because I chose him
[54:24] how are you gonna put it in there
[54:27] all right I gave you a quote
[54:33] yeah where is it that went on today
[54:37] I can find my quotes
[54:39] I wasn't going to use too many but
[54:43] look at the bottom of the page of the
[54:45] notes of the Gateway is off the message
[54:46] Jehovah Jireh number one 1964 uh 402.
[54:54] paragraph 11 and two listen what I'm
[54:56] telling you I'm going to start doing it
[54:58] because it's such a headache between in
[55:00] other words Joe and them I told you
[55:01] before they have to use the 2010 version
[55:04] of the message to make the computer
[55:06] systems run correct all right we're
[55:10] using the 99 version okay this is copied
[55:13] off as what you call the 99 version
[55:16] okay the other we'll show you little
[55:18] things on the side it's a 2010 version
[55:21] and and the Lord with it I'm going to
[55:23] start using that and the and 99 of the
[55:26] time it will be identical but there is
[55:29] rare occasions that they change the
[55:31] paragraph systems and they change the uh
[55:34] they'll put it up in another paragraph
[55:35] make different paragraphs out of it and
[55:38] things like that which when if I have to
[55:40] have a problem and I think there's a
[55:42] question about it I'll give you both
[55:43] versions all right but I will be
[55:45] switching over to the the uh 2010
[55:48] version because it saves them trouble
[55:51] when uh brother Joe was gone I tried to
[55:54] help and Bob back there laughing because
[55:56] he spent the whole service
[55:59] the Sunday that he done it
[56:02] transferring it over
[56:05] to be able to put it on the internet
[56:07] okay so we will be switching over to the
[56:10] new version and and using that but if
[56:14] there's any different differential part
[56:16] I'll try to bring it to you and and use
[56:19] it that way you know if I can remember
[56:22] now we'd like to change the system in
[56:23] the office because it's still on the old
[56:25] all right I want to explain that because
[56:26] when I come up with something but see on
[56:29] this watch eat E11
[56:32] Jehovah Jireh 1964 but one day God
[56:36] called him
[56:37] that's what made the difference when God
[56:40] made the call
[56:41] and that's the way it is to any life
[56:45] it takes God
[56:47] it isn't what you do
[56:50] it's what God does see you say I sought
[56:55] God I sought God you're mistaken no man
[56:58] seeks God
[57:01] God seeks the man
[57:03] see it's not you seeking God it's God
[57:06] seeking you
[57:08] Jesus said you haven't chose me that's
[57:11] John what 10 20 is that what it is I
[57:14] believe that's right let's enjoyment you
[57:16] haven't chose me but I chose you see
[57:20] so you chose before the work foundation
[57:23] of the world or you wasn't chose at all
[57:31] he just come to redeem that night
[57:34] now we get into the redeem one of these
[57:36] days too
[57:37] and all those names were not on the
[57:40] lounge book of life before the
[57:41] foundation of the world is it on in all
[57:44] whose names were not on the Lamb's Book
[57:46] of Life before the foundation of the
[57:49] world is the only ones going to be there
[57:51] anyhow now that's you transfer that back
[57:53] over in your mind I double ready
[57:55] in other words he's saying if your name
[57:58] was not in the Lamb's Book of Life it
[58:00] won't be there because he goes on and
[58:01] says it but he's saying it because his
[58:03] literal words out of his mouth is saying
[58:05] life before the foundation world is the
[58:06] only one who's going to be there anyhow
[58:08] it looks like he you could make him say
[58:10] right there that that what that if your
[58:14] name wasn't in the books on once and
[58:15] ain't gonna I don't know what's going to
[58:16] be there but that's that's not what he's
[58:18] saying until you know that okay
[58:23] you were chosen him before the
[58:25] foundation of the world when the lamb
[58:27] was chosen you were chosen with him
[58:31] before the foundation
[58:33] and it went in the minute when we get
[58:35] the word back to end and we won't have
[58:38] any trouble because the word with is in
[58:41] John
[58:42] in the beginning was the word
[58:46] the word was with God
[58:50] and the Word was God
[58:53] the trinitarians use that to show that
[58:56] there's two
[58:58] but that's incorrect the word with is
[59:01] perfect
[59:02] so is it here before the foundation of
[59:05] the world
[59:06] you're as I said last night now listen
[59:09] to what I'm saying
[59:11] and you're as I said last night an
[59:14] attribute of God's thinking now listen
[59:17] to this
[59:19] they that's the only way you can be
[59:22] eternal
[59:24] and only form of eternal life see and
[59:27] that's God okay
[59:29] now
[59:34] I want to know a little I want to ask
[59:36] you some questions
[59:42] how many gods you believe
[59:45] my current Living God right
[59:48] many forms right
[59:50] many ways of manifesting himself
[59:53] but only one God
[59:56] the father is not one God the son one
[59:59] God and the Holy Ghost one God you know
[1:00:01] three and it's not the great mystery of
[1:00:03] the god in three persons Blessed Trinity
[1:00:06] all right how many gods you believe in
[1:00:08] one true and living God
[1:00:10] all right so what we're going through
[1:00:12] here this afternoon if that doesn't hold
[1:00:14] true you come tell me how to service
[1:00:17] all right
[1:00:19] because we got to keep that straight to
[1:00:21] understand some things
[1:00:24] now listen the Bible said we were chosen
[1:00:27] in him
[1:00:30] question number one
[1:00:32] who done the children
[1:00:41] we were chosen than him
[1:00:43] so somebody chose us in him
[1:00:48] right
[1:00:50] how many of that sensible that's right
[1:00:54] we were chosen in him
[1:00:58] so somebody chose us in him
[1:01:03] all right
[1:01:05] now question number two our thought
[1:01:07] number to go with that
[1:01:09] how could it be that he doesn't have
[1:01:11] respect or person
[1:01:15] ever who this is that done to choosing
[1:01:17] right
[1:01:21] um
[1:01:22] now question number two who's the hymn
[1:01:27] right we were chosen in him
[1:01:32] so we were chosen in him who's the hymn
[1:01:42] I like to ask questions
[1:01:44] I love questions
[1:01:50] so
[1:01:52] without believing in a trinitarian
[1:01:55] concept or thought
[1:01:58] how are we going to be able to
[1:02:01] comprehend this scripture
[1:02:06] that somebody
[1:02:09] done some choosing
[1:02:18] and Jesus simply said
[1:02:21] you never chose me
[1:02:25] I chose you
[1:02:28] right
[1:02:30] Jeremiah
[1:02:33] I knew you
[1:02:35] and ordained your profit right
[1:02:38] before the world all right
[1:02:42] now we're going to comprehend then the
[1:02:45] statement that we've dangled around play
[1:02:47] with a little that
[1:02:50] gifts and callings are without
[1:02:52] repentance
[1:02:55] did you repent to get a gift
[1:03:00] or did you just get a gift
[1:03:06] you didn't repent to get a gift because
[1:03:07] the Bible will be wrong
[1:03:11] see then if you're listening and would
[1:03:13] look at the quotes I gave you along with
[1:03:15] these the quote we read you'll see that
[1:03:18] John the Baptist had nothing to do with
[1:03:21] it
[1:03:23] because he was a gift
[1:03:26] he was a fulfillment of Isaiah what 42
[1:03:30] but he'd have to stand and introduce the
[1:03:32] Messiah
[1:03:38] let the Bible had already said
[1:03:41] there was going to be a deliverer
[1:03:46] to come down to deliver the children of
[1:03:48] Israel
[1:03:53] and God goes out and says Moses you're
[1:03:56] the one
[1:03:58] I gift you
[1:04:00] and who delivered the children of Israel
[1:04:03] out of Egypt Moses no no no the gift
[1:04:07] the god
[1:04:10] I'll be with you
[1:04:12] I'll be in you
[1:04:15] won't be able to stand
[1:04:17] for the gift is eternal
[1:04:21] I didn't make John eternal
[1:04:26] they didn't make Moses eternal
[1:04:29] May the gift eternal
[1:04:32] all right
[1:04:34] now
[1:04:36] so let's get into the godhead just a
[1:04:38] little because I said that's the the
[1:04:40] first part we had there in verse 3 would
[1:04:43] be on the godhead
[1:04:48] then
[1:04:50] somebody had to do some choosing
[1:04:59] because we were chosen in him
[1:05:04] now listen to the wording soon forgive
[1:05:06] me I don't have enough education I'm
[1:05:08] sorry
[1:05:10] so there had to be some way that
[1:05:12] somebody chose him
[1:05:15] I gave you a quote there that brother
[1:05:17] Branham said God chose him
[1:05:20] and said we were chosen in him
[1:05:29] okay
[1:05:32] God chose him
[1:05:36] and we were chosen in him
[1:05:41] huh
[1:05:45] now
[1:05:49] we've got to go back and understand the
[1:05:51] godhead and get it clear
[1:05:55] I love the way brother random would say
[1:05:57] it because it's hard for the human mind
[1:05:59] to comprehend it but sure does sound
[1:06:00] good
[1:06:02] he said in the beginning
[1:06:05] before the eternal
[1:06:09] use your human mind they're trying to
[1:06:12] figure that one out
[1:06:13] in the beginning before so you see why I
[1:06:17] put beginning in the middle
[1:06:20] all right
[1:06:23] yeah
[1:06:24] you're gonna have to help me I get to go
[1:06:26] over there you say wait a minute click
[1:06:28] over don't miss now okay I don't have no
[1:06:30] problem with that all right
[1:06:32] but
[1:06:37] there's not three gods
[1:06:40] right
[1:06:41] we don't even entertain the talk
[1:06:45] but there are many many manifestations
[1:06:48] of almighty God
[1:06:52] he manifested himself as a father he
[1:06:55] manifested himself as a son he
[1:06:57] manifested himself now as a Holy Spirit
[1:06:59] right but it's the same God right
[1:07:03] what did he do and morphe change his
[1:07:06] form
[1:07:08] now go ahead and give you a key if you
[1:07:10] listen
[1:07:13] I thought we believe we I thought we
[1:07:16] believed in Lula maybe not everywhere
[1:07:18] else but that we're the last in morphe
[1:07:27] so we're not out in the scriptures we're
[1:07:29] still right in the middle of it okay
[1:07:34] but how did
[1:07:36] forgive me because you got to use human
[1:07:38] words
[1:07:41] that God choose Christ
[1:07:46] we'll see two or three of them
[1:07:49] you know
[1:07:51] and he says you
[1:07:53] or is it like the denomination says the
[1:07:57] sun came up because the blue equal
[1:07:59] Eternal see
[1:08:00] you know we don't believe that because
[1:08:02] that wouldn't be sensible but as they
[1:08:04] say the son came up and said father let
[1:08:07] me go down
[1:08:10] no don't believe that do we
[1:08:13] all right we believe what the prophet
[1:08:15] said
[1:08:16] the prophet said you wouldn't do that we
[1:08:18] are on kids
[1:08:20] right
[1:08:21] he said so then it was necessary that
[1:08:24] almighty God come down to earth
[1:08:28] to pay the price amen
[1:08:32] said he never finished son
[1:08:37] he came himself
[1:08:41] uh-huh
[1:08:43] until he came South
[1:08:46] all right
[1:08:48] so then look at it ask me watch the
[1:08:52] choosing now
[1:08:54] it's not that he chose one to do
[1:08:58] listen
[1:09:00] he chose the way it would be done right
[1:09:05] now you see the choice
[1:09:09] God chose the way
[1:09:12] that this would take place
[1:09:16] and he chose it there is no other way I
[1:09:19] don't care what our peanut brain tries
[1:09:20] to figure out that we could do a better
[1:09:22] job of it no it can't be done so forget
[1:09:23] it you know four if I'd have been back
[1:09:26] here to help him well where was you when
[1:09:28] they laid the foundation to work
[1:09:33] me
[1:09:35] what you see is not what we look at
[1:09:38] choosing
[1:09:39] I choose this piece of paper
[1:09:42] over this piece of paper
[1:09:45] I made a choice
[1:09:48] me
[1:09:50] that's what we're looking at at the word
[1:09:51] choice or choosing
[1:09:56] God chose
[1:10:01] step over in another form
[1:10:06] to be known as logos pie word
[1:10:10] son
[1:10:14] are you with me
[1:10:16] he chose to step over in another form
[1:10:22] not another call it right
[1:10:25] another form another way to reveal
[1:10:28] himself
[1:10:30] so he chose the way he was going to
[1:10:32] reveal himself amen
[1:10:35] he was going to step over into
[1:10:40] just a human vessel
[1:10:44] now we gotta keep that till we get on
[1:10:46] down here on the other side all right
[1:10:50] he chose to step over in the form of the
[1:10:53] logos the theophany the the the the
[1:10:56] things that we use those great big words
[1:10:58] for
[1:11:00] the word
[1:11:03] and called the son of God
[1:11:07] come what else could you call it
[1:11:10] it's not God the son right
[1:11:13] right a trinitarianism
[1:11:15] he was the son of God he chose to step
[1:11:17] over in a way that he could start
[1:11:19] breaking him
[1:11:21] breaking what's that word
[1:11:23] a way that he could reveal himself
[1:11:27] he had a plan and a purpose remember
[1:11:28] that he was going to see achieved that
[1:11:32] he was going to reveal himself
[1:11:39] dude we keep on trying to get ourselves
[1:11:40] here involved too much until we get to
[1:11:42] the right place
[1:11:45] but you see
[1:11:47] then when he stepped over into word form
[1:11:51] that was his choice right
[1:11:55] and in that word form
[1:11:58] which as I said is not a human body
[1:12:04] you know not a moral
[1:12:07] not a 16 elements
[1:12:10] it was the word body
[1:12:12] right right
[1:12:13] now here's where as I said this morning
[1:12:16] see we get in there in our thoughts
[1:12:18] who is this Melchizedek brother Ryan
[1:12:20] said we buy Pastor Dion
[1:12:23] hey
[1:12:25] he stood
[1:12:30] now what do you live by I told you what
[1:12:33] I like about that Passion Play that time
[1:12:35] I've never seen it again in one because
[1:12:37] he said it's copyrighted but
[1:12:39] you know we generally look it's like
[1:12:41] just like a vapor and things of the
[1:12:44] creation you know and it's just like Let
[1:12:46] There Be military B you know this is
[1:12:49] coming to bed it's made a point that
[1:12:51] stuck with me
[1:12:54] and it just started out a voice saying
[1:12:56] let there being all at once you're stood
[1:12:57] a man
[1:13:02] a man's standing
[1:13:06] to be
[1:13:08] all right it changed scenes you know
[1:13:10] where it went to a baby crying in the
[1:13:13] cradle and that's where they started the
[1:13:15] story
[1:13:16] I shouted
[1:13:20] because you know what
[1:13:22] the man that was standing there saying
[1:13:24] let there be was the man that stood down
[1:13:26] there at 33 years of age or about 30 see
[1:13:30] that begin to perform the acts of the
[1:13:33] Lord Jesus upon the Earth well that was
[1:13:35] perfectly identical maybe they didn't
[1:13:38] even know what they're doing but I had a
[1:13:40] good time
[1:13:42] because to me see when that word form
[1:13:45] stood out there
[1:13:47] we didn't stand out there beside of him
[1:13:51] you know
[1:13:55] but if we wasn't in him now how many
[1:13:58] quotes do you want
[1:14:00] but around said if we wasn't in him
[1:14:03] if we wasn't back there in the beginning
[1:14:06] as the word we will never be the word
[1:14:10] yes
[1:14:13] to where we're at in him that's right
[1:14:18] now do you see the scripture
[1:14:22] we were chosen in him
[1:14:27] now I just a minute that means we don't
[1:14:29] have a choice
[1:14:32] the one I'm talking about don't want a
[1:14:34] choice that's right
[1:14:36] it ain't whether I've got it or not I
[1:14:38] don't
[1:14:42] did Jesus have a choice
[1:14:47] now come on get what I'm saying don't go
[1:14:50] over here in your mind run it to the
[1:14:51] Garden Lord let this past remain don't
[1:14:54] go there
[1:14:56] because he wound up saying nevertheless
[1:14:59] get it over with
[1:15:02] do we say he yielded up his desires his
[1:15:05] choice his thing that's over there
[1:15:07] that's down here in time get back here
[1:15:09] where I'm at
[1:15:12] did Jesus have a choice
[1:15:15] did you look around and pick out oh oh
[1:15:18] yeah you look like one I'll just step
[1:15:19] over in you
[1:15:24] no
[1:15:27] no
[1:15:28] I want almighty God
[1:15:31] or if you're trinitarian
[1:15:34] that Creator God was almighty God in
[1:15:37] another form
[1:15:39] our apps were trinitarians
[1:15:45] so then when he was chosen to be what he
[1:15:47] was
[1:15:49] a sealed language see
[1:15:52] you can trap me in those words see
[1:15:54] because I don't have enough education
[1:15:59] but when he was chosen to be what he was
[1:16:02] if we wasn't there in him we will never
[1:16:06] have eternal life
[1:16:08] other than God giving it to us somewhere
[1:16:11] as a foolish virgin etc etc because
[1:16:14] they're not nobody in there the ones I'm
[1:16:16] talking about
[1:16:19] is exactly what he done on the dead
[1:16:22] Pentecost
[1:16:26] you know what happened on the death
[1:16:28] Pentecost
[1:16:32] we're still looking at it as a God and a
[1:16:34] church God in the church God and a bride
[1:16:36] God willing to change the words
[1:16:38] on the death Pentecost God divided
[1:16:41] himself right
[1:16:44] right he divided himself
[1:16:52] he
[1:16:53] he put in flesh
[1:16:58] what was back there
[1:17:03] he
[1:17:05] 'll win
[1:17:07] he was chosen I was chosen in him
[1:17:12] I didn't make a choice
[1:17:16] you're still over here trying to figure
[1:17:17] out the choice
[1:17:20] get away to see what I'm talking about
[1:17:22] who was the one somebody if the Bible's
[1:17:25] right it said we were joking in him
[1:17:27] somebody done the choosing
[1:17:32] but if we were chosen in him then we
[1:17:34] were chosen in him not by him
[1:17:39] as I said you come down to four dollars
[1:17:42] and things and you look at it and you
[1:17:43] look like well I made a choice and I'd
[1:17:45] done this and I done that
[1:17:47] that's what we hear
[1:17:52] but there was never a choice
[1:17:55] Jesus never had a choice of whether he
[1:17:58] was going to be God or not
[1:18:05] he never had a choice of whether what he
[1:18:07] was going to be
[1:18:17] telling the quote you got
[1:18:20] unconditional Covenant 1954 306 and a
[1:18:23] pair of e or e 29. the Father Abraham
[1:18:27] was the first one
[1:18:28] that I know of this side of the flood
[1:18:30] that was called by grace
[1:18:33] off the page
[1:18:35] by election night
[1:18:40] God chose Abraham
[1:18:42] not because he was Abraham
[1:18:47] not because he was any good person
[1:18:52] God chose him because he was elected
[1:18:57] God did it
[1:18:59] I thought we believed that Abraham got
[1:19:03] an unconditional
[1:19:05] Covenant
[1:19:09] if you could do anything
[1:19:11] the prophet said to save yourself or not
[1:19:15] do anything he said then show me where
[1:19:17] Grace is at
[1:19:18] because Grace is unmerited
[1:19:22] favor
[1:19:23] you never done anything to get it okay
[1:19:26] look life story 1954 3-14 well we could
[1:19:31] take much time on that but just to show
[1:19:33] you that it's true Jesus said no man can
[1:19:35] come to me except my father draws him
[1:19:37] first so man don't seek God God seeks
[1:19:40] him God calls Men by election
[1:19:44] G for for knowledge of God
[1:19:48] now remember this is away from the
[1:19:49] Tabernacle so he's having it
[1:19:51] not get so deep with it right
[1:19:54] God seeks man God calls Men by election
[1:19:58] see
[1:20:00] for for knowledge of God like when Jesus
[1:20:03] when he was born he was the son of God
[1:20:07] he couldn't help cause he was the son of
[1:20:10] God
[1:20:13] now you wondered about my word energy
[1:20:16] I said he didn't have a choice
[1:20:21] he couldn't help
[1:20:26] when he was born he was the son of God
[1:20:29] he couldn't help because he was the son
[1:20:30] of God he was for ordained the Son of
[1:20:33] God before the world began he was the
[1:20:36] son of God and he was the woman see from
[1:20:38] the Garden of Eden that was the bruise
[1:20:40] the Serpent's head he had nothing to do
[1:20:43] with it it was already planned out
[1:20:46] amen
[1:20:48] when Moses was born he was a proper
[1:20:50] child not because he was Moses not
[1:20:54] because he had done something but
[1:20:56] because God chose him before he was born
[1:21:02] okay
[1:21:03] be of good cheer 1954 721
[1:21:08] when Jesus he he was a Son of God all
[1:21:12] the way from the Garden of Eden to
[1:21:14] woman's seed is that right Moses when he
[1:21:16] was born he couldn't help cause he never
[1:21:18] made himself Moses when he was born he
[1:21:21] was a proper child God raised him up
[1:21:25] in John the Baptist 712 years before he
[1:21:27] was born the prophet Isaiah saw him and
[1:21:30] said he's the voice of one crying in the
[1:21:31] wilderness he had nothing to do about
[1:21:34] being the Forerunner of Christ God chose
[1:21:37] him before the foundation of the world
[1:21:39] to be the Forerunner of Christ
[1:21:42] I believe it was Jeremiah said God told
[1:21:44] Jeremiah I said before you even formed
[1:21:46] in your mother's womb I knew you had
[1:21:48] Sanctified you and ordained you a pro a
[1:21:51] prophet to the nation is that right
[1:21:52] before he was ever formed in his
[1:21:54] mother's womb see who can who taken talk
[1:21:57] and add cubit
[1:21:59] to his stature
[1:22:07] now
[1:22:09] if you're getting what I'm saying
[1:22:15] it was not Jesus a human flesh
[1:22:19] that stepped out back there
[1:22:21] in God
[1:22:24] now remember we say this is just in the
[1:22:26] garden in the mind of God but remember
[1:22:28] the mind of God is what brought all of
[1:22:31] this we see to pass
[1:22:34] so let's don't make this greater than
[1:22:36] what his mind was
[1:22:38] right he had a plan and a purpose he was
[1:22:41] going the prophet said to see it
[1:22:43] achieved
[1:22:46] okay
[1:22:53] so then God chose to just step over in
[1:22:55] another form
[1:22:57] call the Christ
[1:22:59] called the word the theophany
[1:23:02] no oh gosh the things the prophet has
[1:23:04] covered with us the Son of God as he
[1:23:06] called him
[1:23:10] see we take Son of God
[1:23:13] coming on earth 2000 years ago now the
[1:23:15] Son of God was the word the logos that
[1:23:16] came out of God whatever she's going to
[1:23:18] call it
[1:23:19] because it was God in another form
[1:23:20] called a son
[1:23:22] who is Jesus God in another form we call
[1:23:25] it son
[1:23:26] but he was God
[1:23:29] he didn't say I'm a son of God
[1:23:34] he said I'm gone
[1:23:36] unless you believe that I am he
[1:23:38] you'll die in your sins right
[1:23:42] so then when God stepped over in another
[1:23:45] form
[1:23:48] there's eternal life there's the word
[1:23:52] as I said a moment ago we bypass the
[1:23:54] word form Amen to stand there with him
[1:23:57] as peoples
[1:24:00] but we were in him or we will never be
[1:24:03] in him and we'll never have eternal life
[1:24:06] as a child of God
[1:24:08] now there's what we want to deal with
[1:24:12] brother Branham said we're part of him
[1:24:16] right
[1:24:18] if you ain't poor to God you don't have
[1:24:20] eternal life
[1:24:21] what does it mean to be a part of God
[1:24:23] well
[1:24:26] thy farts
[1:24:28] no
[1:24:32] you run out of parks and brother Mo say
[1:24:34] about the Apple you cut it up you're
[1:24:36] gonna run out of Parts don't do that
[1:24:40] on the death Pentecost God came down and
[1:24:44] expanded himself right there is no form
[1:24:47] called in the Old Testament except Adam
[1:24:49] Adam was called a son of God
[1:24:54] nobody else was called a son of God
[1:24:59] right
[1:25:01] was because they've lost they failed
[1:25:05] see then Jesus come to be the Son of God
[1:25:08] which was the beginning of the creation
[1:25:09] of God
[1:25:11] right that when God would come down into
[1:25:14] human flesh
[1:25:16] in the wound of a virgin and provide a
[1:25:18] body and step into that body and be
[1:25:20] almighty God standing there upon the
[1:25:22] Earth
[1:25:24] oh brother Dale you're Oneness oh I love
[1:25:26] it then
[1:25:29] this is the kind of Oneness I love
[1:25:32] because the bride's got to be the part
[1:25:35] of God to be made manifest upon the
[1:25:37] Earth and we're not another God we're
[1:25:39] not another person
[1:25:41] that new birth you have in you is God
[1:25:45] Amen
[1:25:46] in the form of the baptism of the Holy
[1:25:49] Ghost
[1:25:50] the problem is quote when all of
[1:25:53] that is give out
[1:25:57] you want that quote
[1:25:58] when all of that of God is give out
[1:26:03] Amen in other words when all of the
[1:26:06] pieces of God go down
[1:26:09] you're going to have God completely done
[1:26:12] let around and said that godhead is not
[1:26:14] even complete without you that's right
[1:26:16] amen see I'm not talking about a bride
[1:26:19] being a second person or something
[1:26:21] something by God you know God making
[1:26:24] something buying like that it's not that
[1:26:27] it's in right right
[1:26:32] we were in God or we'll never be in God
[1:26:34] that's right
[1:26:37] when he stepped out in that word form we
[1:26:39] would have in that word form right there
[1:26:41] in him here's where it's at see when
[1:26:44] he came on Earth we came in him amen
[1:26:49] but you know what they're doing today
[1:26:50] they preach it
[1:26:55] he came in US
[1:27:01] that's not right
[1:27:03] right oh yeah I found a new bird bring
[1:27:06] it on down yeah I know what you're
[1:27:07] talking about I know what they're
[1:27:08] talking about
[1:27:10] see
[1:27:12] we came in him he didn't come
[1:27:15] right man would give us eternal life
[1:27:17] without Calvary right
[1:27:20] he wasn't Adam
[1:27:23] come on brother Adam wasn't in e
[1:27:27] H the bride is in Christ
[1:27:33] that way we're one that is true Oneness
[1:27:38] so when he was joking I was joking when
[1:27:42] he was chosen to be what he was I was
[1:27:43] chosen to be there too
[1:27:46] he said then that's another that's God
[1:27:48] to be a respecter person
[1:27:50] okay now
[1:27:53] we can't believe that God's respecter
[1:27:55] person's right
[1:27:56] so there must be some conceivable way of
[1:27:59] understanding that he's not a respecter
[1:28:01] of person
[1:28:01] and I hope it's what you just heard me
[1:28:03] say
[1:28:05] yes he never chose to be one he was
[1:28:08] he was just what he was
[1:28:10] right
[1:28:12] you didn't choose to be a Christian
[1:28:13] brother colleague he wasn't sick in God
[1:28:16] now come on you was Innovation we're
[1:28:18] human we're on this side okay we covered
[1:28:19] that this morning you were praying you
[1:28:21] were doing but what was it God was
[1:28:23] trying to run you down
[1:28:24] right
[1:28:28] right we weren't seeking God it was God
[1:28:30] seeking us
[1:28:32] the goodness of God the scripture said
[1:28:33] lead us to repentance
[1:28:35] he was trying to chase us down
[1:28:38] we thought we'd tried to chase him we
[1:28:41] just got in the way
[1:28:47] are we done but we thought was right
[1:28:54] the Holy Ghost never came on the death
[1:28:56] Pentecost because the 120 was so perfect
[1:29:04] they were just died
[1:29:07] they believed God's word
[1:29:12] and they stood there
[1:29:15] what a good thing did you do to be saved
[1:29:18] wouldn't that what was asked of one of
[1:29:20] the disciples that what good thing a
[1:29:23] rest of Jesus what good thing
[1:29:26] Jesus said do this do this today he said
[1:29:28] I've done every minute and the Bible
[1:29:30] said he looked at him and he loved him
[1:29:31] because he knew he was right
[1:29:35] he says one thing to hit him what
[1:29:38] saying what you got together before
[1:29:43] now like I've always said if he just
[1:29:45] said you have 10 million dollars go give
[1:29:48] a couple of million and I'll give you
[1:29:50] eternal life no voters hey give me you
[1:29:53] need to pull the wheel for that flopped
[1:29:54] it down well
[1:29:58] but when he put it on the basis just
[1:30:00] give it
[1:30:02] get away from the thoughts of money and
[1:30:04] come and follow me
[1:30:06] would not he have made him a fisher of
[1:30:08] me and just like the rest of them amen
[1:30:12] he would give him a job
[1:30:14] but see his riches was too much
[1:30:17] he couldn't give up his riches
[1:30:19] so you see it today people can't give up
[1:30:21] their riches
[1:30:23] hmm
[1:30:25] see then when Jesus come in this world
[1:30:31] he said within him when he walked ashore
[1:30:33] to Godly well now it was we little bitty
[1:30:35] people running around in the body
[1:30:37] to get over because you're in my spot
[1:30:39] that's what the kid just do we
[1:30:42] 'd be right you're getting too close to
[1:30:44] me
[1:30:45] he looks like he might be thinking about
[1:30:48] moving over here
[1:30:50] now I know your kids don't do that
[1:30:56] what you see
[1:30:59] he
[1:31:01] is he alone
[1:31:03] has eternal life
[1:31:07] and the only way we can have eternal
[1:31:09] life
[1:31:10] is to receive eternal life
[1:31:13] right
[1:31:15] so we step across that bar that we draw
[1:31:17] time when we get over here
[1:31:22] and we begin to feel a pull in our heart
[1:31:25] and you know
[1:31:28] that comes is not right we're sinners
[1:31:33] we're sorry for about being that away
[1:31:39] and we begin to say Lord forgive me
[1:31:42] we start going to church we start trying
[1:31:44] to be better we start doing this
[1:31:45] happening
[1:31:48] and that's all well and good
[1:31:50] because God is looking at that
[1:31:55] he loves that
[1:31:56] he sees that at least you're trying
[1:32:00] this ain't no haphazard way back
[1:32:05] Catholic church now remember
[1:32:08] they said that God struck Paul down to
[1:32:12] give him eternal life
[1:32:14] he made him take it
[1:32:17] so it was better to force people to
[1:32:18] serve God you know than it was and not
[1:32:20] serve him at all so they beat him in to
[1:32:22] do it they killed him and made them
[1:32:23] confession
[1:32:25] see that was their college
[1:32:28] but surely that's not our thoughts
[1:32:30] so now we come over onto this side and
[1:32:32] we have a lot of things involved in
[1:32:35] we don't realize these things before
[1:32:37] knowledge predestination choosing a name
[1:32:40] on the book justification plan of God
[1:32:43] um land and purpose we don't know we
[1:32:45] don't have none of that involved
[1:32:47] coverage we're lost
[1:32:50] and we may have a knowledge of it
[1:32:51] because we said in church it may still
[1:32:53] be lost and I've heard those things
[1:32:55] but get the point one said
[1:32:58] we begin to feel a little bit and we
[1:33:00] need we feel like that you know when
[1:33:02] brother Brown and said every human
[1:33:04] mortal
[1:33:08] come on
[1:33:10] are you going to amen are you gonna sit
[1:33:12] there
[1:33:13] ever human moral
[1:33:16] I had to shine pool
[1:33:18] amen he said even the Hot and Hot
[1:33:23] who's never heard of God
[1:33:26] he knows there is a God Amen
[1:33:29] come on
[1:33:31] he has a desire in his heart
[1:33:35] but he's not part of God's plan and
[1:33:37] purpose
[1:33:40] only his family is a part of his plan
[1:33:42] and purpose
[1:33:45] the rest is people that will be foolish
[1:33:48] virgins and Jews and different things
[1:33:51] and we'll be given eternal life we're
[1:33:53] not talking about giving eternal life
[1:33:55] we're talking about receiving eternal
[1:33:56] life here that's right
[1:33:59] so then we we've cried praying long and
[1:34:02] we we choose him we choose to go to
[1:34:04] church we choose to do better
[1:34:06] and he looks down and he says good
[1:34:10] he sure don't want to act like the
[1:34:11] devil's children
[1:34:12] and then he'll come down one day you got
[1:34:15] to be saved whether you want it or not
[1:34:18] no he didn't do that
[1:34:21] he put us over here
[1:34:22] man we've got an opportunity
[1:34:25] to accept him as our savior
[1:34:29] if we don't do that then he's not
[1:34:31] obligated
[1:34:33] what do you mean he saw me get eternal
[1:34:35] life I'm going to get it
[1:34:37] he saw that attitude you just had
[1:34:40] he saw that statement you just made he
[1:34:42] saw that thought you injected
[1:34:46] you knew you wouldn't write
[1:34:48] that wasn't his child
[1:34:50] what's God's child to be
[1:34:56] what's God's child to be
[1:35:00] father
[1:35:02] I love you
[1:35:04] I'm sorry
[1:35:06] I haven't been your child I haven't
[1:35:08] acted like I need to die
[1:35:11] I haven't had the right attitude
[1:35:13] I was not done right I've been out in
[1:35:15] the world
[1:35:16] forgive me
[1:35:19] forgive me
[1:35:22] give me an opportunity
[1:35:25] and I'll serve you
[1:35:27] huh
[1:35:29] see God does look at those times
[1:35:32] because that has to do with your
[1:35:33] existence upon Earth
[1:35:38] but if we wasn't backed our chosen you
[1:35:40] know we you won't be chosen to be bright
[1:35:42] that's why the Bible said many are
[1:35:45] called
[1:35:46] a few are chosen
[1:35:49] The Chosen is the ones that was in
[1:35:52] chosen in him
[1:35:55] so that everybody that confesses and
[1:35:57] things like that and praise will not get
[1:35:59] eternal life
[1:36:02] but now he will not override your free
[1:36:05] moral agency he gave you that
[1:36:08] you must start some work must be started
[1:36:10] here within us crying and praying and
[1:36:13] sicking after him
[1:36:15] and then when it does and he can come on
[1:36:18] the scene and give us eternal life we're
[1:36:21] not concerned about all these other
[1:36:22] things seals plagues trumpets vows the
[1:36:24] end time message or whatever we're just
[1:36:26] concerned with Father forgive me
[1:36:30] I love you
[1:36:31] ever tell him that
[1:36:35] tell him every day he loves to hear
[1:36:38] other Prairie green said
[1:36:40] run around told him said brother Perry
[1:36:42] said when you feeling close he said you
[1:36:45] tell anybody around him loves you
[1:36:48] see when you're feeling close to you you
[1:36:49] telling brother around lotion he loved
[1:36:52] God didn't he
[1:36:54] why because he was a child of God
[1:36:56] he had a lot of life that he went
[1:36:58] through because of the choices he made
[1:37:02] but Danny Henry the tones and
[1:37:04] interpretation because of this choice of
[1:37:05] great portion of Heaven's gone away
[1:37:06] we're going to get rewards for things
[1:37:08] that we do in this world
[1:37:12] not to do it not that we want it
[1:37:17] not that we want it
[1:37:20] if they come up today and said your dad
[1:37:22] said when he died he owned this company
[1:37:24] and he forgot to tell anybody about it
[1:37:26] so now there's millions of dollars
[1:37:28] laying there in this company and we're
[1:37:30] going to give all the children millions
[1:37:32] of dollars because you're his children
[1:37:34] would that make me anymore his child
[1:37:38] oh I'd love him then yeah that's the way
[1:37:42] we are
[1:37:43] man I'd really fall in love with love
[1:37:45] with him being
[1:37:46] start with
[1:37:50] I really love him then I like it when
[1:37:52] he's correcting me but I really love you
[1:37:54] if he gave me all this money you know
[1:37:55] yeah
[1:38:00] how much all this child of Sam Dale
[1:38:02] regardless of whatever takes place or
[1:38:03] goes with the name
[1:38:08] or change that
[1:38:09] and if they told me right today said
[1:38:11] well you're wrong you was adopted and
[1:38:13] we're going to tell you your name is
[1:38:14] McGillicuddy he was adopted and we'll
[1:38:17] give you the right to go back to
[1:38:18] McGillicuddy and you can have all the
[1:38:20] Miguel McGillicuddy and Heritage
[1:38:23] I would not change
[1:38:26] how many of you would change your name
[1:38:28] to get millions of dollars
[1:38:30] oh you're dumb and stupid I'll agree
[1:38:32] with you
[1:38:33] I am
[1:38:35] but I have a child of God and I won't
[1:38:37] turn out my father
[1:38:41] I know who my father is
[1:38:44] because this is a kingdom this is not a
[1:38:47] natural life of what
[1:38:49] I'll just keep what I am
[1:38:51] but see then if we go through life we
[1:38:53] begin to learn about predestination we
[1:38:56] begin to learn about four knowledge and
[1:38:58] therefore knowledge is that God for new
[1:39:01] and he would predestinate because he
[1:39:03] foreknew
[1:39:04] I'm beginning to feel pretty good
[1:39:06] because I did have something to do with
[1:39:07] it
[1:39:08] and I was saving myself
[1:39:11] God save me
[1:39:14] with the choices I make
[1:39:16] in life
[1:39:19] shows whose father
[1:39:23] that I'm a shut up
[1:39:25] I thought adoption was to glorify the
[1:39:27] father I didn't know it was to glorify
[1:39:30] me and you I tried my best to tell you
[1:39:32] that everybody thinks adoption is the
[1:39:35] father going off the scene the son
[1:39:36] coming home I don't agree with that I
[1:39:39] never have since I come in the message
[1:39:40] I've always taught it and you know it
[1:39:42] adoption to me is the Sun going off the
[1:39:45] scene and the father being lifted up
[1:39:48] let me lift up my father
[1:39:51] amen
[1:39:53] I don't have to worry about it then
[1:39:54] he'll Lift Me Up
[1:39:57] but are you listening we come to
[1:39:59] glorification we find out hey that was
[1:40:01] back under
[1:40:03] justification was back there we're
[1:40:05] learning the mechanical side over here
[1:40:09] we're seeing the plan of view of God
[1:40:11] come into view
[1:40:13] here
[1:40:16] because without this there would be no
[1:40:17] plan this is the plan this is the part
[1:40:19] that we're to come here and become his
[1:40:21] children
[1:40:23] huh
[1:40:24] we become the word here
[1:40:27] as we receive the word that's why we
[1:40:29] want the word we receive it why because
[1:40:31] it's our father
[1:40:32] word all right we see the plan and the
[1:40:36] purpose we're on this side we're
[1:40:37] beginning to look at things on the side
[1:40:39] of life
[1:40:40] because we realized we were chosen than
[1:40:42] him
[1:40:43] now
[1:40:45] you won't have questions today but
[1:40:47] writing down for Wednesday if you want
[1:40:48] to and we'll try to cover them because I
[1:40:51] realized it
[1:40:52] you know what I'm trying to speak that I
[1:40:54] leave loopholes and things for people to
[1:40:56] worry they can can do and and things
[1:40:59] like that but uh
[1:41:01] if you need anything
[1:41:03] about whether you were divided let's see
[1:41:10] I'm not one specific one
[1:41:13] forgive me for a second
[1:41:24] the message call conference in 1963 uh
[1:41:28] 608 he's talking about how they come
[1:41:30] down to tongues of fire and not we said
[1:41:32] we ought to be ashamed to let our
[1:41:33] organizations divide us
[1:41:36] when God divided himself Among Us that
[1:41:39] we might be one you don't have that now
[1:41:42] so don't look for the quote
[1:41:43] God divided himself Among Us that we
[1:41:46] might be one
[1:41:49] that's something man
[1:41:51] I thought we believed that we were many
[1:41:53] members of one body
[1:41:55] all right
[1:41:59] this will all men know that you're my
[1:42:01] disciples do you hear that brother and
[1:42:03] sister God divided himself we're never
[1:42:07] divided one another because we're parts
[1:42:10] of God Amen
[1:42:14] we're parched off God
[1:42:17] hmm
[1:42:18] he divided himself into your you become
[1:42:21] a part of God and if God divided himself
[1:42:23] in that great color of fire and those
[1:42:25] little licks went out over each one of
[1:42:27] those persons he said
[1:42:30] what happened on death pinnacle
[1:42:33] it went out all for the over the persons
[1:42:36] but with one color of Fire
[1:42:39] there's just one God
[1:42:42] we're the last form of God upon the
[1:42:44] Earth is the Bride of Jesus Christ how
[1:42:47] many years have I taught you that 30.
[1:42:50] were the last and morphy of God to the
[1:42:53] Gentile dispensation which means we are
[1:42:56] the lives form of God then we are not
[1:43:01] children of Jesus who was a child of God
[1:43:07] that makes you a grandchild
[1:43:10] we are children of the Christ
[1:43:16] that makes us the children of God that
[1:43:19] we are a part of that Christ
[1:43:23] we are the children of God We're The
[1:43:26] Offspring of God he was the beginning of
[1:43:28] the creation of God brother and we are
[1:43:30] the rest of that creation
[1:43:34] when we're going to believe it
[1:43:38] you see then
[1:43:41] Joe
[1:43:43] where were you when the morning Stars
[1:43:45] sang together the sons of God shouted
[1:43:46] for joy
[1:43:49] job may not know that answer
[1:43:52] but I do
[1:43:55] I was there is that eternal life no
[1:43:58] nothing else not persons Souls
[1:44:00] identities and this that and the other I
[1:44:02] was there is that part of eternal life
[1:44:04] that was in him
[1:44:06] and I saw the Plan of Redemption
[1:44:12] let me say another word then you can do
[1:44:16] if Jesus was almighty God to Christ
[1:44:20] then truly he would look down true and
[1:44:23] know back before the world man
[1:44:26] and his submission would be to the cross
[1:44:29] and the things because
[1:44:32] he chose to do it
[1:44:36] he was chosen to be the sacrifice
[1:44:42] because of his own choosing
[1:44:47] then we chose
[1:44:51] not Mormon Doctrine I know the doctrine
[1:44:54] I know the two Soul doctrines I know
[1:44:55] what you're talking about
[1:44:57] I don't believe it but I know it
[1:45:01] we chose to come into the world
[1:45:07] we shouted for joy
[1:45:10] we that have eternal life today
[1:45:13] shouted for Joy not as people running
[1:45:15] around Glory Hallelujah shouting in
[1:45:17] years old in your corner not over my
[1:45:18] corn weed all over here no it was in
[1:45:21] Christ
[1:45:23] bottled up in that one word form
[1:45:27] but we chose
[1:45:32] because
[1:45:33] the Mormon Doctrine is
[1:45:36] that we were all up in heaven as people
[1:45:40] and that we wanted to glorify Our Father
[1:45:43] it's pretty close it's pretty good doing
[1:45:45] drilling a lot and especially people
[1:45:47] this message what you believe but we
[1:45:49] chose now I know this because I spent
[1:45:51] eight hours with one man that was an
[1:45:53] authority and let him explain it to me I
[1:45:56] didn't pick the first ranks I pointed a
[1:45:58] guy with the and a matter of fact he had
[1:46:00] that said that
[1:46:03] some of you if any Mormon would would
[1:46:06] know he had the sickness he knew because
[1:46:08] you can't in the Mormons you can't have
[1:46:09] more than one wife everybody can't have
[1:46:11] more than one wife and a woman Doctrine
[1:46:13] never was there
[1:46:15] it was only the authority people
[1:46:19] only the Melchizedek preached to them
[1:46:24] go Ashland find out about the
[1:46:26] Melchizedek priesthood was allowed more
[1:46:28] than one life
[1:46:30] so I asked him to explain it he said we
[1:46:33] were people up in heaven
[1:46:35] and we wanted to honor our father
[1:46:40] and said by doing that said we will
[1:46:42] decided to come to Earth and be lost
[1:46:45] so we can glorify Our Father
[1:46:50] he said Satan had a plan to save
[1:46:53] everybody now this is their Doctrine
[1:46:57] but said Jesus had a plan to just say so
[1:46:59] many
[1:47:01] and said father accepted Jesus's plan
[1:47:03] and that's what made the devil mad and
[1:47:05] caused him to become the devil
[1:47:08] that's their Doctrine that's all
[1:47:13] but you see
[1:47:16] if job is right
[1:47:18] and if the prophet is right that said
[1:47:20] that was when we saw the Plan of
[1:47:22] Redemption come into view then we knew
[1:47:24] in that form of what we were as eternal
[1:47:28] we knew we was coming to Earth
[1:47:32] he said boy you sure don't understand
[1:47:34] foreign
[1:47:44] that's why brother Brown said
[1:47:46] if you have eternal life
[1:47:50] you was not saved on no certain day you
[1:47:56] were always saved right you was never
[1:48:00] lost exactly right glue was never lost
[1:48:03] the Christ the
[1:48:08] eternal life right the Christ was never
[1:48:12] lost that's right man
[1:48:15] and always Eternal right
[1:48:19] but you see to how for my father could
[1:48:22] have it displayed
[1:48:24] then we come over to this side of the
[1:48:27] line
[1:48:29] and we become human Mortals
[1:48:34] he knew who would be saved and he
[1:48:36] wouldn't that's right we also knew that
[1:48:38] there'd be a lot more people in heaven
[1:48:39] because you and I would come this way
[1:48:41] right foolish virgins and people like
[1:48:44] that's going to be in heaven they're
[1:48:45] going to be given eternal life a lot of
[1:48:46] people are going to be giving eternal
[1:48:47] life and being the good to you
[1:48:49] right right right
[1:48:54] but you see
[1:49:02] we are part of the Christ
[1:49:04] We Are The Offspring of God as Paul said
[1:49:08] on on Mars Hill he said even as your
[1:49:11] poets have said
[1:49:13] We Are The Offspring of God
[1:49:15] The Offspring of God are not children of
[1:49:18] God that are children like that it's God
[1:49:21] in another form called a child
[1:49:28] see
[1:49:29] can we go back
[1:49:33] we're going to see Jesus
[1:49:36] but we're going to realize he was
[1:49:38] almighty God
[1:49:43] God
[1:49:46] that's what I'm talking about this thing
[1:49:49] I hope you understand sorry being a
[1:49:51] little nasty this afternoon
[1:49:53] got to the basis of come on musician I
[1:49:56] got to the bases wondered about whether
[1:49:58] or not to quit preaching a lot of times
[1:50:00] to you because we go outside last Sunday
[1:50:02] we went outside and it was five o'clock
[1:50:04] or 5 30. we got out there at four to
[1:50:07] five thirty before everybody left
[1:50:09] I thought my Lord I could preach another
[1:50:11] home
[1:50:16] I mean this
[1:50:18] but we don't want to do that because the
[1:50:20] mind can only comprehend what the bottom
[1:50:23] can endure
[1:50:24] so that's a pretty good statement
[1:50:27] you know
[1:50:28] you get tired and wore out then you
[1:50:30] don't understand but go home listen to
[1:50:32] the tape you see anything I'm wrong on
[1:50:35] come to me don't go to everybody else
[1:50:36] now do me a favor and come to me and
[1:50:39] talk to me about it and say I don't
[1:50:40] agree with you
[1:50:41] if you want you to find out I ain't
[1:50:43] gonna argue with you or get mad at you
[1:50:44] and stomp at you and run to the pulpit
[1:50:46] but brother dick call me out wrong
[1:50:51] that's the way people do that's the way
[1:50:53] preachers do trying to scare the
[1:50:55] congregation into submission
[1:50:57] I want you to love God Amen with all
[1:51:01] your heart with all your soul with all
[1:51:04] your mind with all your being
[1:51:07] and you know what
[1:51:09] you can't never hate me
[1:51:14] like I've always told you
[1:51:17] if I've got your soul
[1:51:20] in my possession
[1:51:24] you may not have to worry about money
[1:51:30] if your soul is in my hands
[1:51:34] but she won't mind everybody else want
[1:51:36] some money and we're about to show
[1:51:38] they just want the money but that's all
[1:51:41] right that's their business
[1:51:45] you know how I live and what I do most
[1:51:47] of you make more money than I do
[1:51:51] and it's because of my choice
[1:51:57] but you know sometimes
[1:51:59] choices has to do with Wade gave up more
[1:52:02] money per week than most of you make in
[1:52:05] a week and that some of you make in a
[1:52:08] month
[1:52:10] the girl from plant manager to cut and
[1:52:12] grass
[1:52:16] that's because he wanted it in a way
[1:52:22] a few years ago I cut my salary 200 a
[1:52:25] week just because I didn't need it
[1:52:28] you don't need it give it to me well I
[1:52:30] don't need it
[1:52:32] what I mean by that I got enough to live
[1:52:34] on
[1:52:36] why are you going to pack up all of it
[1:52:38] in the bank now there's nothing we're
[1:52:39] not going to go out and empty I hope
[1:52:41] nobody with all of this problems with
[1:52:43] the government fixing to go busted it'd
[1:52:45] be sensible to go buy you a few extra
[1:52:47] groceries and all I can you always need
[1:52:48] to have that but don't go grow out all
[1:52:51] your money and stick it in your pocket
[1:52:53] because if the government goes busted
[1:52:55] the money in your it is not worth
[1:52:57] anything it's toilet paper that's the
[1:53:00] truth brother right that's right
[1:53:05] and Mike is all excited
[1:53:08] maybe this will be what'll put us in a
[1:53:10] rat no no a reveal word you're going to
[1:53:12] put us in Rapture when we realize who we
[1:53:14] are go ahead brother I'm sorry 252 in
[1:53:16] red book 252 in the red book anybody

[1:54:00] working
[1:54:06] me from
[1:54:10] from God brought that Pride out of his
[1:54:13] body
[1:54:15] right
[1:54:30] my life is powering would be displayed
[1:54:33] on the death penis when the Holy Ghost
[1:54:35] would come down
[1:54:42] the bike
[1:54:44] thank you and when that Holy Ghost came
[1:54:47] at the end today
[1:54:53] we are
[1:54:57] damn he chose me
[1:55:07] you've heard me Kevin
[1:55:10] I told my wife that way would be
[1:55:12] preaching the gospel can't even Shadow
[1:55:15] me that forfeit when he was still out in
[1:55:17] the world
[1:55:22] I never went told him
[1:55:29] tell him God called into breach
[1:55:33] months later he's coming he said Daddy I
[1:55:37] want to talk to nothing you don't want
[1:55:39] to talk to me it's not not the daddy you
[1:55:41] need to talk to he said do you know what
[1:55:43] I am talking about I said yesterday
[1:55:46] I should go ask your mother
[1:55:50] God doesn't show me where you'd be I
[1:55:53] said but now son We're not gonna have
[1:55:55] something

[1:56:11] volunteered

[1:56:26] months later he comes
[1:56:28] I can't go
[1:56:32] away
[1:56:33] foreign
[1:57:30] since the beginning
[1:57:36] not the prodigal son we need to hold
[1:57:40] me I love to look in the Bible and find
[1:57:43] myself
[1:57:45] just because my name is Samuel I don't
[1:57:47] go by that but you know it is odd
[1:57:51] that Samuel's mother was named Hannah
[1:57:56] and Samuel was a child of old age she
[1:57:59] was real old
[1:58:01] my mother was 42 or 40 at least
[1:58:04] somewhere right in there
[1:58:09] my daddy was 65 when I was conceived
[1:58:15] Hannah had a son named Samuel
[1:58:19] but see that don't make me anything
[1:58:21] it's just good things that I like to see
[1:58:24] along the way
[1:58:26] how many of you can relate to what David
[1:58:28] why don't you put yourself in the Bible
[1:58:30] sometimes
[1:58:32] why don't you women men whatever put
[1:58:33] yourself in there
[1:58:35] he said to David he said I took you
[1:58:39] from the Sheep go sheep go oh whatever
[1:58:42] it was
[1:58:43] I said a major key
[1:58:46] thank you
[1:58:50] I took him for a little longer machine
[1:58:55] foreign
[1:59:35] I look at that sometime when I say God
[1:59:37] what might you know
[1:59:41] my wife would take two or three dollars
[1:59:44] that's all we have
