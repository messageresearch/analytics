choice your desire good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like turn back in your scriptures where we've been reading from Roman Romans 8 and then we will go to Revelations 13 and kind of Cu thought on through the word remember Wade and Jun and them traveling home this afternoon and brother Bob and them coming back from Alabama and remember them just pray the Lord would be with them uh I called a check on Abby said she was doing better they're watching in and so praise the Lord for that and just pray that the Lord would be with each one with uh remember the fellowship meeting will be this coming Saturday over at brother Tom kain's in Sweetwater Tennessee so if you're wanting to go with us now make sure you let us know ahead of time where we won't be uh we have to be trying to get everything together but we have to leave uh from our home there at least by 10:00 because it's a far up there to it's the hardest run we have of not as many miles but it's a hardest one because it's all way through the mountains so just you know and if it comes any snow and things up in that way we will be uh saying y'all have it we we won't want to worry about it but just remember that good to see brother sister West and family back there with us and any other announcements I generally miss something okay I get okay so all right okay Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for this day in your grace unto us we thank you for all things and we pray that you would just bless us with your understanding and may your presence be with each one of us because that's what we desire more than anything else we ask you to come and speak to us as we read your word that you would come and speak to us from your word to show us the hour and the time that we're living because that's what we need to talk about all of the others in the Bible that have already lived their hour our and time is wonderful but yet to see our day and its message and where we're living in the time we are here upon the Earth is the most important thing unto us we love you and we thank you just have your way bless W and them as they traveling bobing them and just have your way with each and every one of us thank you for touching L Abby and thank you for being with all of the sick because you promised it so we believe you and guide us all now and keep us in Jesus name amen Romans 8 for we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he did also predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren or whom he did predestinate them he also called look at it it's already pised right right and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified all that's P tense all right and what does it say what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us wonderful all right Revelations uh 138 and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world and if any man have an ear let him hear he that leadth into captivity shall go into captivity he that kth with a sword must be killed with a sword here is the patience and faith of the Saints you may be seated Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now remember what we were saying about that this morning that if we get off the word you know if I get off the word preaching the word to you and you keep following that then I will be in captivity to my own personal ideas and thoughts and you will be in captivity to what I think in my doing so you better check out to see whether or not uh the word is being preached and then if it is then we follow after that and try to fall in that line and category right all right now uh my point my thought we'll get to it in a minute but I want you to to to get a little bit of understanding like I said there in Romans it it says that you know uh those that he he he predestinated already then uh he called those he called he's Justified those he justified he's already glorified sir now that's God looking at you and I right amen now that's not us looking at each other right that's not us looking at our own selves that's God looking down and seeing it because it's already passed as far as he's concerned all right then that way we need to look at the word of God in that form when the prophets would get stand up and and they would speak something as na non we say you know talking about chariots josling in the streets running like lightning you know torches and things he would be looking down to seeing Buicks old mobiles running into each other on the expressway with headlights on you know I mean that's simple understanding all right but as far as we are concerned uh we had to wait until back you know so many years ago uh before that could be made manifest all right but see when God says something it's already finished amen that's right he doesn't look at anything you know now I believe I'm I'm honest and I really appreciate the prophet of God when he said it one day he said that God saw all of this and knew what would happen but said he didn't stay back there said he came down to live with us I believe he's here right now he he's not he's not out there waiting on us he's here right now because if you'll think about this then you will understand the Bible better that as far as as God is concerned he looks at things as present tense that's why when he spoke to Moses he said I am that I am all right that's as present tense as you can get I am that I am that's right that's present tense that's not future tense that's not past tense all right see as far as God is concerned when he speaks something that's already done all right we read there we'll get back to it in a minute where the names were written in the L the book book of the life of the lamb slame before the foundation of the world that was in God's mind it was not in a reality because you'd have to wait until we come down here to manifest it all right Jesus Christ stood as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world but that means god is looking at all of the life and the things of Earth and as far as he sees it it's not even a second you know we talk about a thousand years as a day and a day a thousand years and say well Jesus was here two days ago you know because we talk about a thousand years but see really in reality before the world ever begun before anything ever come into being he already knew and if we don't believe him to be like that then what kind of a god do we have he would just be like me and you he would be constantly learning or are getting a better way of doing something or you know things maybe work out but no if we'll look at it then we can understand why brother brandom preaches as he does listen to him about it he talks about things as being here that's what caught me as I told you when I came into the message you know I heard a man talking about a God that existed right you know not up y under well y under or something happened you know no he was talking about God right there and see he wasn't looking out to the future he would speak of that God would speak of the future but just remember when God speaks of the future the future is present you understand what I'm getting at you know if we can't believe God that way then what kind of a god do we have when that Prophet would say something Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive as far as what he said it was already done why it had been spoken remember the other night Wednesday night talking about the thoughts of God you know how that the thoughts of God are Eternal but yet he's got to speak it to you and me right and he say thought until he speaks it to you and I are the prophets and you know it was God's thought he transmitted it to Moses right it became Moses has t that's right all right then once it did that then Moses when he was speaking it was the word and it could be written down you know pin or whatever because it would be the the the point all right but getting to a to the thought why don't we read The Prophet's message as we read the Bible then if we believe the Bible to be that way and in that message we can see that he was trying to get us not to look to the Future although they're you know it's fine but what are we trying to do you know what do we want to know the future for I think about this the other day I thought you know if we if if if I knew something could tell you would that help your faith you know I mean and now sister Anna I'd say and sister Anna tomorrow so and so is going to happen does that help your faith your faith ought to be anchored in God's word that would be fine because that's that's good but you know what it would do to most people scare them right cuzz didn't they say every time we got around brother Dale what are you going to say you going to tell me something see you get scared well instead of it happen it'd be a hindrance but see in God there is no future the prophet said that here's where mankind messes up always looking back to what God was looking to forward to what will be and forgetting what's taking place now God's not up in heaven he's here with you and I amen he's not over under on the other side waiting on us to get there he's here with us the Rapture is him taking us there but to do that he's got to be here so then when we read that your name was written in the L book of life before the foundation of the world just remember we've been through it we've been over it up and down that God in his forn knowledge knew you would want to be saved and thereby he could write your name in the book see but then when a prophet brings that thought listen you you just do it sometime just just put on any tape and you just listen to that tape with the intent of following Brother bradam and that's why all this date problems has got into all of it because sometimes him being a prophet he'll say it happened two days ago it might have been 10 years ago I know I do the same thing I'll say I'll say sometime I preached on that a couple of years ago well it say 10 you well you know I I'm beginning to get our old enough and childish enough to just want to stay where I'm at w worry about tomorrow I me come on seriously church I mean one one day brother around said it like this he said right around the coming of the lord your jobs wouldn't going to be important right now did he say quit your job no he said if you know what you had in your pocket as money you would take it out and burn it did he take it out and burn it no so it's different but what we need to do is just settle down and say okay Lord speak to me that's right today not not tomorrow don't tell me about tomorrow must scare me to death you wind up like that guy would have told you got a newspaper a day ahead of time you know a man he could he could win the lottery he could play on the horse races he could do everything cuz he got a paper newspaper Dee but one day he picked up and read an obituary that he died the day before so that give you a lot of fits wouldn't it so future what are we concerned about the future let's be concerned about the present tense and then we'll be doing as God is dealing and we'll be doing as the prophet of God is doing and when he says you always was eternal that's where we kind of ended up right did that mean we was always saved that we didn't need to be saved the same message which is the future home he spends great length of time explaining the new birth up page 15 16 17 future home the whole message is basically dealing with a new birth and he said if you don't get nothing get this Plan of Redemption right then he come along like we was reading and he says you always was eternal well you know I could say Amen because if he's speaking as God speaks right then I can say Amen to it but if he's speaking like me and you talk I can say oh me know it won't work and that's made a lot of people just believe say you know always was eternal but then you don't need Jesus Christ to come and die see he's done away with the entire Plan of Redemption and that's man's ideas see that's what I talking about this morning taking part of the word and our own ideas put them together and what do we got a hybrid condition there's not a denomination in the world that doesn't claim to be speaking for God right and claiming what they believe is the word of God is that true but now how can God be that confused well the Lord showed me there was a he gave me a vision there was a trinity but how can you do that when it doesn't exist right but yet we can be so spiritual see you know we we think we've got it all figured out instead of then believing that God is trying his best to reveal the Plan of Redemption and revealing himself to us then we can understand what we've reading this morning reading what where he said you wasn't saved on any day you was always saved Now read the book all the way over to that statement and tell me that he wasn't explaining how it is to be born again the very steps and the very thing and he said I taught this from the from the beginning but a lot of people that's 1964 I think it is yeah but a lot of people say well he changed after the seals broke he said I've taught it from the beginning he's speaking in the tense of God you know what I mean tense in other words present tense a prophet speaks in present tense now listen to what I'm saying a revelation to you and I will be in the present tense right and I know I I hit a little touchy spot there this morning because a lot of people will take bre around them and they'll say and he does say it he said see that little woman at the well he said that little woman at the well said it was quickened to her that he was the Messiah and said that seed come to life now I I'll come back in another message on down the road and read a lot of these CU I want you to read them what you say that seed was quickened or did it give her eternal life did Mary carrying the very God himself in her wound did that give her eternal life no she even denied him as I said this morning said when he was over about 12 years old said your father and I claiming he wasn't even virgin born don't sound like she had eternal life but see we want to take this to thoughts and we just cram them in you know and you can have a revelation without having the new birth right you think about it there's people healed all over the world today right is it required to have the new birth to be healed no it's required to have faith now they didn't doing that then they said about Peter there he was th aren't the Christ the son of the Living God that was made alive to Peter but it did he did it give him the new birth no he had to go to the upper room right right so now here's the way I do I look at things and then I I come down in my own mind which is the only way you can do it so don't get this all super duper revelation you think everything starts in your brain in your mind just because it's in your mind didn't put it in your heart all right and see when I look at something I look at it as well as I can to see well hey wait a minute if this is so then what I used to think about this can't be so if there's just one God then what I thought about the Trinity was wrong you agree see then I'm looking at things and I've always tried to do it that way to where that just like that point we're talking about if you always was eternal then you don't need Jesus okay now so this is the way I think if we don't need need Jesus you know we always was we don't need Jesus you said oh no people are not saying that that's the deceiving part right because I've heard people preach and you have too that Jesus Christ is almighty God and then turn around and make him a Trinity right that's right come on you heard that when years in the denomination they preach he's almighty God but then that a while it's back well it's just in three persons you know well now I'm like this if I always was eternal I don't need Jesus are you with me but if I admit I need Jesus okay I know I'm tricky ain't I sister Gail if you believe you need Jesus Christ to save you you needed him to give you a new birth and you know for certain you wouldn't Eternal like mankind is say that's a certainty that's not a question or thought or a point that's a statement of FL a fact that's right if I say that I was lost and I am now saved then when a prophet would say you always was eternal that's not throwing me why Paul said in Romans right I've read that 56 57 times and in that Paul said those who justify is already glorified well then Paul was saying we always was eternal was that what he was saying you see where our minds he said brother Dale you just confuse me I never confuse nobody I'm sorry my wording and my way of speaking has confused people yes I'm sorry but you tell me how else you can get to the truth you know what I mean you believe all your life this is my left hand no no no no no no that's your right hand cuz that's what we always believe well if I'm turning this away which one is it did you get it which one is my right hand you said that no no to you that's my left one right you said you're a dummy I agree what a good point look in the mirror and tell me which one's your right hand in your left hand my wife always has trouble with it I've had her to tell me honey you got to turn left you got to You' doing you got to turn left you got to turn to the left I said honey uh would you raise your right hand oh cuz we're all out way put up four or five mirrors and reflect yourself through it and then raise which is your right hand you know what I mean turn this where tap that turn it and which is your right hand this is what we've been taught we've been taught there a trinity we've been taught as this we've been taught as that we've been taught we we don't need prophets you didn't come through the Baptist oh that was our we don't need prophets no more oh yeah we'll take evangelists and pastors and sometimes a teacher but we don't need prophets CU Jesus Christ had all already spoke to us that's right well look what you've done with the word of God we see remember that when a prophet then is speaking and he'll say hey you wasn't saved on any day if you have eternal life that eternal life always was eternal that's simple but is it say see you won't agree with that I'm sure on the Internet won't agree with that but what else you going to say you can't argue the point if you say you always was eternal you don't need Jesus he didn't need to die for you all right but if you say you needed Jesus and you need to be born again you've annihilated the fact of believing that you always was eternal I'm sorry Church it rips my heart to pieces to think of the stupidity of human mankind and what we are taught and what we accept as truth yeah what maybe 100 years ago guy proved or something that if you rolled the ball 35 mph down through that that gravity let loose and it just fly up and go up in the there you heard that then you now you run down to 2,000 M an hour in these cars and things you know the bigger things that are it still stays on the ground but you see that's what we do doctors used to bleed you a PT when you got sick right come on I don't want that now see we found out that the blood and it it was to let you bleed out some was great for some things because the blood reproduces I always enjoyed giving a a unit of blood there on Motors because first off I got off the line for an hour you know and I got to eat cookies and drink juices but second all it would make me feel better in a day or two why because my body's having to reproduce it well that was their thoughts but you get some poor old God that's so weak he can't stand it you know I mean it just it can't even move what do he do we need to bleed him aart I always wanted I know what I mean but I always thought about I'd like to grab the doctor and say okay doctor you Pine from you P from me you know but and it good but listen Church to come down to see God's word is eternal you remember the other day we trying to explain where Jesus said my words are spirit and their life all right but you know I can't say that you can't say that the best I can say is I will try to speak to you what God has revealed to me right that's the best I can do right and even in that I'll use wordings that are not spirit and life come on but see all them remember the other night I gave you all of God's word is deratization that and I make my words a part of it I made a hybrid out of it we know what hybrids are they take a big gr T of corn we said this morning a little popcorn and they pollinate it together in a things and they do it and what do you wind up with a beautiful good little ear of corn that's really tasty but once that's done you try to plant that the next year you're going to get a warped up naughty looking Sun something and did not the prophet say that that's what God does he says he doesn't have any grandchildren and he said every generation following gets worse is that true the further off the word cuz see they had that's what someone was asking me about it and I thought well surely we understand but you know I mean we do but you know they said well where do you get the the grain to go back and plant it again you got to go buy it from them cuz that's they pollinate it they they bring it down you know if you want to see some good pollinations come down house sometime I'll show you some corn that I planted Silver Queen and Golden Queen it's pretty it winds up high yellow and high white you know that's just from pollination right that ain't even for your you're doing but just remember a hybrid can't breed back you never thought like the brother R would say it like this he said where in the world or where in the time has there any Nation ever risen back to Power he said Israel is the only one right no nation has ever risen back to Power only Israel when you think about it show me one denomination that ever come back right not going to come back because they're hybrid now the people there are honest sincere people just like you and I not throwing off on anybody not not degrading anybody they haven't heard see you and I have heard amen and then what we do with what we heard Brother Don and I were talking about and he said he was speaking to to a guy and said the guy he was talking to him about water baptism or something and said the guy he seen it he just immediately seen he he knew that guy seen that he ain't seen the guy in a couple of years he ain't going to come back around but you know what he will answer at judgment for what was quickened unto him uh you don't agree with that huh well you tell me it's not right me and you out here arguing about it somebody hear us say this life at us but you let that be just touched into your heart just like that that's right you're going to answer for that somewhere so I'd rather get it out of here all right but think about it the same man that says it of saying you always was saved is the same man that we were covering this morning it says so if you have eternal life you were an attribute of God's thinking before there was anything but him what does that put you back there does that put you back there no it puts the thoughts of God of you and I right as being there come on he said he didn't believe in the Mormon Doctrine pre-existence reincarnation or transmigration of Souls all right you say well he did believe in a certain way of pre-existence but uh I believe in pre-existence I believe in pre-existence of eternal life don't you I believe God is eternal and always was eternal and I believe if I have that life in me then that life that's in me always was eternal right that's right I don't need a new birth after getting a new birth I need a lot of being born again grows in Grace and knowledge right but not another New Birth one birth many feelings so if we were in his thinking at the beginning if you got eternal life there's only one form of eternal life eternal life had no beginning and no ending so if you have eternal life you were an attribute of God sing before there was anything but him amen I believe that I believe the eternal life that I have always was eternal but I believe there was a time I had to receive it now there's your pro and con as I said if you believe you didn't need to receive it then you don't need Jesus that's right I'm sorry for being like that but you know what you might find out one of these days God told me to say that that's your business not mine cuz I don't have to worry about it cuz I believe it's the truth whether he said it or I said it or you say it or a donkey says it I believe it's a truth if you had something you don't need something but if you admit you didn't have it until he come and died that's right then he would be saying to Nicodemus Nicodemus what you need to do is believe right believe what Nicodemus had already confessed he said we know you're a man sent from God nobody can do the things that you're doing except God be with him he already publicly conf or Jesus confessed that but he said you must be born again he said I don't understand you why because he was speaking in a Heavenly term right he said if you have eternal life you always was not your being here that's who is this Mel jezdic that's where we're at this morning not your being here not not anything you're looking at or any part the only thing that you're looking at it can be Eternal is the soul anyway the body and fear is not Eternal but you explain to me now and I'm just as sincere and and weeping in my heart to say it but you show me every Doctrine that's ever been and I'll show show you that it always leads into adulterous sa fire I don't mind that cuz you see I know one thing for sure if I don't have it lined up straight I'm headed that way I never heard a preacher talk like you you probably never will you'll never hear one being as honest and sincere as I try to be with you because if I have my own ideas and thoughts put with this message I'm going right into a bed of adulter sometime physically let alone the spiritual part I'm already in I don't no you say you shouldn't talk that away why brother B said if you have eternal life today you are in God by God's being in you that's right that's it God bringing his own life into you and I gives us eternal life see then why can't we speak as the Bible speaks come on why can't we speak as the prophet speak why can't we speak in present tense yes sir amen I'm already raptured oh now wait a minute that's a little bit too much future now that that's just a little bit beyond what I think well if you're sitting there sick and you say by Stripes I'm Healed right is that a future tense or present tense which one is it future tense won't get you healed p t won't do it well all of them back there got it and all them out you are going to get it no no bring it down to where you at that's right yes sir bring your salvation you got to confess it according to the scripture with the mouth confession is made with the heart man believeth is that the Bible right all right see then what are we doing but we take our thoughts and their ideas and just make it what we think it's supposed to be and we ended up on the talking of how brother randam which speak a lot of times about the little woman at the wh he said there she was and all of that but said she was a predestinated seed and said down in her l a predestinated seed and as quick as he spoke to her she said you know we're looking for a m he said I'm he she throw the water po down she run into the city she does all the thing he said see there said that predestinated seed come alive all I ask you did that give you did that give her eternal life if that gave her eternal life then when Jesus died he died in vain come on you got one you got the other you going to have to take one side of the other women today there's no in between on this thing that's right you're either going to go with it this way or you're going to go with it that way it's got to be made today why because somebody's telling you it's got to be made if that little woman received eternal life and Jesus Christ died in vain but we got to admit because the prophet said it that that word that predestinated seed Was Made Alive all right right I believe that cuz I believe that as I saying to start with anybody in the world today can believe God and God will heal them the prophet said if God heal one anybody else meets that condition they got to be healed right all right would that mean they're saved doesn't mean it does so if we is it possible Brother D to get a revelation Peter got one that's right he said D the Christ the son of the Living God lied and cussed over there denying the Lord Jesus and you tell me he had a new birth I I'm I'm literally going to laugh up my sleeve at you thinking you're that dumb well brother Dale now we've all done you tell me come on I quote pretty good you know you show me where the Prophet ever said that you with the Holy Ghost can go out and turn the word down I want to see it sure we got problems we're human beings we're living but we're not going to turn the word down that's right you're going to deny Jesus Christ as your savior then I'm going to tell you you don't have him that's right might as well go ahead and deny it but if you have it they can't take it out of you they ain't going to deprogram no Christian right he said it cleaned the Blackness out of that little woman at the way and made everything white he said there was a seed laying there a predestinated seed that was in it was God's thoughts before the foundation of the world now think about it now here's what we're going to get to and we'll try to finish up this part of the message I like to repeat things sometimes you asleep sometimes you're playing with a kid sometimes you're looking sometimes you're doing if I went by everybody's looks I would be vastly confused about what's going on now remember kids I me adults excuse me remember adults were not kids kids can sit in a group and you can be talking around them and they'll remember what you said right you better be careful what you say in front of you kids you remember in the Bible the 42 of them that was ate up by the sheers because they were out there saying go up old ballhead that was Mom and Daddy sitting over at home said that old baldheaded guy thinks he's something why don't he just go on up said he said he's following Elijah said go on up which one you you better be careful what you say them kids right they going to get you in trouble but remember now adults joy we don't remember that good do we we were starting to go to Jeffersonville I think it was brother mol us one time the women wouldn't go but anyhow they were sitting at the house there and brother Mo walked in there and he said if all of y'all talk at the same time when we G said you get a lot said his point was it ain't going to matter anyway cuz he wasn't going to remember it all of you sisters sat down a while ago and talk for an hour and a half you remember what she talked about some but not all worst part of those you remember the bad right okay get on it but I'm asking a simple question and I believe what the Bible says and I believe what the prophet says and I believe that by God's forn knowledge for knowledge remember we went through week after week after week of for knowledge that he could predestinate that's according to Paul in Romans that he would predestinate by his for knowledge all right right then I believe that and I believe that by his for knowledge he knew whether or not you and I would be saved that's right amen I believe that he believed that he he knew that before the world this is not a play game with him right all right but did he predestinate as we've all said which means predetermined or did he do it by his full knowledge if he done it by his own point and you're making him wrong because the prophet said he doesn't predestinate by his desires that's right when he predestines by his for knowledge CU he desired that everybody be saved right God desired everybody in the world to be saved but he knew everybody was not going to be saved right so he could write names in The Book of Life before the foundation of the world you you say we sing that song there's a new name written down in heaven sounds pretty but ain't no Revelation to it there ain't no new name written down in heaven it either wrote down before the world or never be written there right this is not a play game or something we thought well I've always been taught this I been T that well if this and that don't fit this the Bible then where are we at that's right we need to get rid of this and that and settle down to God's word all right so I firmly believe may I quote this that every person that comes into the world is a child of God by creation right that's right and you going to tell me the devil brought some I'm going tell you fo with you only God is the creator Satan can't create he perverts there is no children of the devil that the devil brought into the world he perverts us once we come into the world Amen all right then if every child every person is a child of God by creation and he says in Ezekiel 18:4 he said All Souls are mine all right then if that be true and we believe it then where is the problem with understanding that God God by full knowledge could look down through the world and see every person that would come into the world you believe he could do that if you don't what kind of a God you got he's not infinite if he couldn't look down and see every person all right now if he could look down and see of a person then why couldn't he look down to see what we desired but see we're so spiritually re relev you know my brother Dale you don't understand nobody sought God Amen the Bible says the Bible says that but you mean you didn't seek God is that annihilating the fact that you prayed and cried before God to receive him now what's it saying no no man sought God it's exactly right we wern't made to be seeking him but he come down in contacted us and that changed the situation right all he had to do was just pass by us that was it so it was God seeking you and I but what did he use he use life he use things to bring you and I to a place that we would want him because he can't override your free moral agency right he can't save you when you don't want to be saved so then I believe firmly that before the world if I have eternal life today that eternal life was part of God's life that's right and he knew that I want it so he'd have it for me am he had it for everybody else but they don't want it can the thing form say why did you form me so is that Paul he didn't form us wrong right but now listen so then I can believe that before the world you remember a few months ago six or maybe when I was preaching on when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy you remember what I preached on that what did I preach on that that that that was before the world in God's mind that's right but that he was looking down to where we are now right we wasn't people up in heaven running around shouting you're getting into pre-existence now come on if you don't believe that then I want you to answer me one question if we was back there shouting screaming and hollering I thought the prophet said it was because of Salvation well now where was anybody back there that needed saving come on I just try to make things carnal enough for us to understand it was there anybody back there that was saved you know was there great big meeting going on and everybody getting saved nother would nobody lost that's right is that sensible so it wasn't nobody lost why would it be shouting about salvation but we're down here shouting about it right and he was back there looking down here seeing us shouting about our Salvation all right because remember we'll get to it in a minute and I'll back up on it when he said Jesus Christ stood as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world just remember in God's mind that was a reality you go with me but in reality that was not a reality if it is why they have to die why didn't he just walk down here and say I died for the world I see y'all back up into heaven no what he saw in his mind before the world one day transmitted to an Earthly situation now if I'm wrong there I want you to explain something to me if I'm wrong that that you know he died before the world physically you know some way then you realize that when they offered the first lamb that would be making Jesus Christ false prophecy maybe you don't see what I see there but if you offered one lamb and that being real back there then you're saying it that's not real amen come on I like to get down to talk to you and let you think but just remember I know and realize that most people are not even hearing what I'm saying because they're thinking right they're figuring out what I'm talking about where I'm going what I'm doing and I invite you to not do that just stay with me you might get trapped out on the limb somewhere so the best thing to do you stay with me and listen right if Jesus Christ stood literally before the world why did they offer the blood of bulls and goats no they had to offer them cuz God offered it to speak of Jesus Christ that would come and die right if he hadn't died we couldn't have eternal life that's right right right see then where our minds goes out so much and we run it off sounds beautiful but what good is it we were healed before the foundation world but why are we still sick same time is the lamb slain he healed us right the same time the lamb was slain he saved usen yeah that's right no we say but but brother that always was then you always was healed don't go to no more doctors don't tell me you're sick cuz you always was healed you see it don't work we think we've got it all figured out I know somebody like me comes along is hateful arrogant old dude that don't mind just telling you you don't know where you're at you know why because until God revealed it I didn't know where I was at I was just like you and everybody we're all in Mass confusion I'm just trying my best to save you out of that confusion but have I become your enemy because I tell you the truth now that's something you mean I tell you the truth trying to save your life a lot of you know it some of you were sitting there in a ministers meeting we had one time and this one brother got up and he started talking about that I'm not going to tell you what I believe I going tell you what somebody else believes you know how that is and he started talking about that it's okay to have more than one wife cuz the chickens has got it the cows has got it the deer got it why can't we got it well I was asked to speak after the brother said that and the first thing I said was why in the world would any idiot want more than one wife you only got two troubles and two mother-in-laws right you know what that man wouldn't speak to me for about 5 years I mean I dug that church out of polygamy because they were already and I'm not lying to you say I'm telling you and sorry that I have to tell you they had already planned who was going home with who they had already picked out in the church who was going home with who we'll meet at judgment if you don't believe that's true and I dug that church out of polygamy the whole church was in it but I become an enemy until 5 years later I called a man to just try to talk to him and his wife called and I could hear her on the phone and she said called his name and said brother Dale wants you on the phone he said brother who come on who is this I said brother Dale down here in Georgia you know he used to be friends you know you see church we think we got it figured out but we better live listen because our life is at stake yes sir we talk about a Rapture how can it be a Rapture without a revealing of the word of God that's right and you show me that anywhere but you see I believe brother R say we come here with a seat in you I'd say Amen right but now all I want to know is when was it put there right well what do you mean i' b in the world with it and wouldn't what the prophet said right when was it put there where was it put and if I need it how can I get it brother Al and brother Fred and brother collie and him brother dick nut was riding with a certain brother and he come kind of believed in that old two Soul Doctrine and we left Hendersonville North Carolina no excuse me we left Tennessee coming to Hendersonville and uh the time we got down there the brother was glad to get out of the vehicle with us and I was saying boys let off cuz they were ripping him to pieces and asking him questions that he had no way to answer like where was the seed where was the seed of God put before the world and when you come in the world where was it put but you see if we take the truth of it we can see what it is let's start now I'll try to read real fast okay go ahead we start with number 10 works of Faith Express 19651 206 now here predestinated plan is in plain view just as other seed the word of God is a seed and must have the ground prepared beforehand if you sewed seed just throwed it out there on the ground it would do no good the birds would pick it up you throw it among tickles and Thorns it choke it out pretty soon Jesus's Parable said so the ground had to be made ready first that's what the preaching is for right the preaching is for making the ground ready for you to receive what God is saying okay so God in Sovereign Grace prepares the heart first he prepared you before the foundation of the world to receive him in this age that's simple isn't it he fornew You by his forn knowledge and ordained you to eternal life he knew you therefore he prepared you amen when before the world right look at the next one this is trying to do God a service without his will and all of these will basically be after 6 63 seals opening roll it on down to where we got this the statements because you read all the other and see if it don't work I give them to you look or back up brother ours they're saying to brother randam and said we know how Billy Graham can do this we know how Rob but how in the world can you do this who do you think going to believe it in other words he said it's God I the Lord has planted it before the foundation of the world I'll Water it day and night unless some of them should pluck it from my hand Isaiah I water it I planted it I put their names on the book before the foundation of the world by predestination I'll Water it just keep on moving I'll furnish the water you just spray it out right I'll Water it day and night L one of them gets plucked out of my hand going to the next the message taking sides with Jesus 1962 look what he says yeah 243 244 walked up there and Jesus said behold an Israelite in whom there's no G he said Rabbi when did you know me who's that talking about what he said before Philip called you when you were under the tree I saw you what did the water struck that predestinated seed right oh my when it did he said Rabbi thou the Son of God you're the king of Israel what was it the seed was laying there ready God SED it back under before the foundation of the world that it should bring forth the light right at that time but did it give him a new birth look at the next why could I speak 1963 7:14 the morning service I esteem that so highly because God in his Mercy before the foundation of the world world saw me and placed a little seed in there that my faith would fly above these things of the world and now he's called me to it I regard my place look the next Christ is the mystery of God revealed paragraph 467 you can you can't commit adultery you're already pregnated Glory he's talking about the new birth of what you're doing you're prisoner to Christ he can't take a hold the wound of life is closed to anything else you're already his by predestination that seed has come to life no world can get in oh how we'd like to stay on this about an hour I'm sure understand Christ and his alone already finished the seed was there the seed was already when was it put there now read the question the question was when was the seed put there he asked the question and when was the seed put there before the foundation of the world has predestinated us unto eternal life and as soon as the lifegiving flow that seed laying there other seeds that just would come in wouldn't take hold just quickly it stopped up the wound all the rest of the seed was drove out okay when was it put there before the foundation of the world go the letter I want to get these through and then I'll I'll stop and preach for a second go to number 15 which is why Christ speak paragraph 38 see the seed of God is actually placed in us from the foundation of the world and when the light first strikes that seed it brings it to life but the light first has to come upon the seed okay seed not a with a Shu 1965 429 number 16 God knew before the foundation world who would be saved and who would not be saved by predestination by for knowledge he saw every member put every name on The lon's Book of Life before the church ever began and when was it what is he saying all these things were okay next one 17 questions and answers 1959 628 were we Spirits then he's asking the question the back before the world see no we were not even nothing then but in God's mind we were and he spoke it and it materialized Jesus was slain before how many knows that the Bible teaches that Jesus Christ was SL was a lamb of slain before the foundation of the world why God spoke it and when he spoke it it was as good as finished there's your prophets and all the people saying the thing right and when he saw me he saw you before the foundation world we were only figurative in his mind right then when we come to the world we were both male he's talking about then he coming down to Adam and a different thing all right think about it look at the next one then we'll just stop this is number 17 number 18 taken from when their eyes were open they knew him he is the Eternal one and when these things that's happening now are only the attributes of God's thinking at first it has to be a thought now you remember the other day when we were bringing first God thought then he spoke it becomes a word right he thought of a world he spoke a world right see he thought it and he spoke it that's simple isn't it it first it has to be a thought and then a word and a word when a thought expressed is a word and then it's spoken it has to happen and the whole thing is God unfolding himself in his attributes and then God being made material tangible that we can talk to speak with in his whole church body and everything Therefore your name was in his thinking that's how you have eternal life now was you reading that Therefore your name was in his thinking that's how you have eternal life because you were in this thinking you can't have it no other way if you got eternal life you always was you if otherwise you just can't say well I belong to church I do this no eternal life never had a anything that has Eternal never did begin and cannot end so you were only in his thinking your name who you are and what you are that's the only way you could ever have eternal life cuz you always was got some more in there but I'll stop because I want to point to you when was the seed put there before the foundation of the world amen right all right I ask you questions were we back there simple terminologies you know what a lot of you sitting here thinking today you're thinking that some of these is just come in ain't understanding they might understand more than you do because they ain't all theology minded they're listening but you think you got it all figured out and you think brother Dale is just too deep what's it any depth to what I've said today if we believe in Eternal God if we believe God is real if we believe that he is infinite then before the world ever begun ever a thought of the world ever come into existence molecules atoms or anything he dwelt alone with his thoughts that's right CU that's the best word they can use to call him Elohim Elohim means self-existing so he existed alone with his thoughts were we back to there no were we Spirits were we morning stars singing together sons of God shouting for Joy No did Jesus Christ literally die no not back before the world was your name put in the Lou book of life before the foundation of world you see there's some other things your Prophet has said that people don't want to talk about there is no writing of new names but what about where he says it your name goes on the book as a Believer at sanctification that's right you see I've been preaching 40 something years folks not 30 minutes I know a lot of the quotes that he made and they'll all fit together as a beautiful glove he didn't write down a name when you got saved at the altar already for the world but you had to come to that altar that's right that's right he said you receive eternal life right here at the altar right but see if there is is a God and that God is real then in his thinking before the world this whole world went by and he saw it all right he saw every day and every person and every thing whatever happen and he was still in his mind were we Spirits no were we people running around back no Jesus Christ never physically died before the world that's right if he did you blood of bulls and goats would be annihilating it you don't realize what that just said but some people ought have enough sense to see what I just said if Jesus Christ physically died out there before the world then when you offered that blood of bulls and goat you're denying he died that's right whether you like it or not whether you admit you're doing that oh no Brother D I'm not saying that well what are you saying in God's mind he died before the world Amen that's right he could speak it in the Bible and speak it was already finished he could speak of rapture is already finished he could speak a future home a millennium of the things that in his Bible it hasn't even come into existence yet but he could speak it as already been done that's right and when a prophet speaks like that he does that's the way your Prophet speaks turn any tape on going home today and notice in there if he ain't talking positive just like it's there that's right and that's where man gets confused they try to figure him out and he'll say just a few days ago I was it so and so and they run it back so well that was 10 years but listen church we were in God's mind before the world right now we're going to get to it next probably no I doubt it got one more but the prophet said the person didn't come predestinated eternally from God God he said it was the word of seed that's right yes sir that comes predestinated eternally not the person so why don't we get the person out of it and then you won't have people run off in adultery you know if you get this person out here out of how in the world can you have any of those things would you see when was the seed put there in God's mind before the world he saw you saw you'd want to be saved he put it there then wrote your name in the book as far as he's concerned the whole thing's finished but that didn't make it finished for you and I as I said while ago whether you like it or not you think I always was eternal I take that I don't need Jesus but then the other people that are gone his hearted people that will come over and say say I really need him and you're denying that you always was you see church it was not some physical happening did God put a seed in you what kind of a seed did he put in you what kind of a seed did he put in you a word when his word is his seed did he put John 3:16 in you brother Callie in Acts 238 and you brother brother Addison and is that what he put in no no he he he he just put a spot a spot of what you have a spot of eternal life a spot of eternal life is eternal life yes sir you don't have spots you either got it or don't have it right going take it up Wednesday you can't have a black white bird you're either a sinner or a saint amen that's right God won't dwell in an unclean vessel then you want to put him somewhere in you right come on well it's in your soul cuz they got the in apartment they found out now the so oh boy you mean God's an inch square compartment we've done been through that that your soul is your being of who you are and looks just like you well I've always been taught well it's about time maybe to think about what you've been taught why don't you just sit down sometimes and analyze what you've been taught when I was in the Baptist I was taught there was three Gods what about the rest of you well I never did believe that well why did you tell me you did when I talk to you come on but you see we don't want to admit we're wrong what was put in US was it some form of a word was it some kind of a seed you know like a bean a potato corn or was it a word or was it God's predestination by his for knowledge brother Bram used his two statements he said the little woman at the well was had a seat in her from predestination from predestination then he'll say by predestination but that's the only thing that I've ask you today that I hope to the ones that are thinking on it did that little woman at the wh when that seed was quickened in her heart did she get eternal life if she did why did she ask Jesus Christ the Savor that's blun a it but you tell me it ain't right now you said when I just always believed I always was eternal well I think it's about time to quit believing that right now here's my Lifest amen but brother down we don't believe that well why are you sympathetic with it why do you play around with it why don't you just tell people I don't believe it what don't you do like I told you about that man up there that believe brother around was deity talking to him there in Jeffersonville he said yeah I believe he was God he was deity I said now pointed over to this other man I said that man there with a new birth if you'll tell me that man is deity with a new birth and we do away with all the gifts and all the things of brother around life we just come down to person to person and I said if you think he's got the Holy Ghost then he's deity I'll agree brother around was deity that's right he said oh no I'm not talking about that see there would no need to talking to him because he believed brother Brandon was God you said well people be that way yeah but Church get it one more time if we was anything before the foundation of the world other than in God's mind in his thinking as an attribute of thought then what kind of a doctrines do you have and if he was a thought in his mind did he have to put a seed in you or did he know the seed of the word of God would fall in you that's right did he know that you would accept it when others turn it down right amen what about it oh eternal life just a play thing to people eternal life is very serious to me because eternal life is a person amen there's not but one person of eternal life and that's almighty God yes come on musician then when almighty God comes to live in you and I then we can say we're Eternal amen think on these things but what about all these quotes what about them you mean we have spent 6,000 years trying to come to a Plan of Redemption now do you agree with that we've been here 6,000 years right I mean come on we know the world hold lot older than that but mankind 6,000 years dealing with the Plan of Redemption try to get saved to go to heaven right and then we're going to wind up with it it always was we didn't need the new birth that's what it is we just need somebody to tell us and isn't that the bases of most people I told you brother Hal was there years ago when I was seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost there was a certain brother there was a wellth thought of brother there and there were two other brothers and myself that night praying with the baptism of the Holy Ghost that brother's word was law with a lot of people and he said afterwards he said I believe you you three brothers receive the Holy Ghost tonight the other two took his word neither one of them is in the message today I was honest I said I didn't get nothing but you see I wasn't going to say what somebody else said it I was going to have my own confession if you can't say nothing other than my wife says it my husband says it my pastor says it a lot of people would love for me to point my finger at you and say you got the Holy Ghost I believe it but I ain't going to do it you're going to tell me whether you got it or not because you see I could be wrong and you'd spend all of your life depending upon what I said instead of seeking after god let's stand think on these things when was that seed put there before the
