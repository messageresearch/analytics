[0:02] you know most the time
[0:04] people
[0:07] the you know they won't speak up well
[0:10] they got all this senority stuff going
[0:12] on in the message and I've got I've been
[0:14] in the message long than you have I know
[0:16] more than you do you know what Peter was
[0:18] in the message a lot longer than Paul
[0:20] was yeah Paul comes up one day and Peter
[0:23] says Paul says things hard to be
[0:24] understood Peter was walking with the
[0:26] man Paul never saw the
[0:28] man but there was a level of
[0:30] understanding that Paul had come to and
[0:32] you know what nobody taught Paul the
[0:34] Holy Ghost he took the scroll the Old
[0:37] Testament what we just read in Proverbs
[0:39] and all that he took that Old Testament
[0:41] and he brought 80% of the New Testament
[0:44] in
[0:45] writing to us so so there are levels of
[0:50] understanding
[0:52] that we have to come to so now we're
[0:54] recording so let's go to statute of
[0:56] perfect man and
[0:58] uh thank the Lord for the reading of the
[1:01] word this morning amen they're in the
[1:03] Book of Proverbs
[1:06] so now to the statute of a perfect man
[1:09] we're going to read some quotes this
[1:10] morning I want to try to read them all
[1:12] make comments cuz I've never got
[1:14] finished with all my quotes so but you
[1:15] see brother Bob made it like this so we
[1:17] can read it like a book we can go
[1:19] through Page by Page all right so can
[1:21] you read can you see that yes okay
[1:24] sister Anna yes I okay zel perfect man
[1:27] 1962 I know you can't see on the video
[1:30] but U but you can uh you can listen this
[1:36] is paragraph 59 now these people are
[1:38] Peter is saying here how that we must be
[1:40] takers partakers of his divine nature
[1:43] now each one of us are trying to grow
[1:45] into the stature of God that's our
[1:48] that's our goal that's our promise and
[1:52] like we've said many times before that's
[1:53] our
[1:55] requirement and I'm spending a lot of
[1:57] time on the foundation because if you
[1:59] don't get the found Foundation right why
[2:01] build a building right now after we get
[2:03] through with the Seven Seals then at
[2:06] that time of the sounding of the seventh
[2:08] seal are the loosening of course we know
[2:10] what a seal is is to loose the ministry
[2:13] to loose Seven Seals and we'll see that
[2:15] right on the chart is loosing a message
[2:17] something that's sealed up all right
[2:20] let's go
[2:21] to same we statue of perfect man
[2:24] paragraph 61 last Sunday night I
[2:26] preached on the key and the key is faith
[2:28] faith holds the key key and the key is
[2:30] the scripture but where do we get our
[2:33] faith if faith is the key where do we
[2:35] get our faith like sister Anna Canard
[2:37] says she's been reading more and it's
[2:39] become more inspired to her the words
[2:40] become more well brother BR said if you
[2:42] want to get closer to God read your
[2:43] Bible and study if you're not hearing
[2:44] anything from God you're not studying or
[2:46] reading enough that's
[2:48] right too
[2:52] simple and the key is Faith the the
[2:55] faith holds the key the key is the
[2:58] scripture and Christ is the door so
[3:00] Faith takes the little hinges of the
[3:02] scripture and unlocks the glories and
[3:03] good of God out to his people see so
[3:06] it's Faith holds the
[3:08] key that unlocks Christ to the people
[3:11] unlocks it reveals it so today we're
[3:14] going to take that same key to unlock
[3:16] the way to become a virtuous Christian
[3:18] in the stature of God that that and be a
[3:22] living Tabernacle for the Living God to
[3:24] dwell in paragraph 63 keep reading
[3:27] remember God reveals himself in three
[3:29] ways
[3:30] first time he revealed himself in a
[3:31] pillar of fire it was called the
[3:34] fatherhood that was in the Old Testament
[3:37] all right then that same God made
[3:39] manifest in Jesus Christ which he built
[3:41] a body made this body thirdly through
[3:44] the death of that body he Sanctified a
[3:47] church that he can dwell in it was God
[3:49] above us God With Us God in us the same
[3:53] God all right paragraph
[3:56] 74 through that blood we are cleansed
[3:58] and now our blood blood our life which
[4:00] came by living through sexual desire
[4:02] brought our life into the world the
[4:05] blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us
[4:07] changes our Nature by sending upon us
[4:10] the Holy Spirit then we become in the
[4:13] divine nature of
[4:14] God everybody got that then we become a
[4:18] dwelling place for
[4:20] God Jesus said at that day you'll know
[4:23] that I am in the father and the father
[4:24] in me I in you and you in
[4:27] me paragraph 87 now I want to say this
[4:30] that there are some people who have a
[4:32] portion of this virtue knowledge wisdom
[4:34] patience and so forth that don't even
[4:37] profess to be Christians now we just
[4:38] were teaching Sunday school and that's
[4:40] true there are some people have a
[4:42] portion of this that don't even pretend
[4:43] to be Christian but that doesn't that
[4:46] won't do it it's like a black bird
[4:48] trying to put peacock feathers in his
[4:49] wings to make him a peacock he only
[4:52] disgraces himself be better to stay a
[4:54] blackbird see when he tries to exercise
[4:57] these things without being a Christian
[4:59] he just simply out of place well now
[5:03] paragraph 94 well now that's the way it
[5:06] is trying to manufacture that's what we
[5:08] don't want to do we don't want to try to
[5:10] manufacture these these virtues that's
[5:12] right okay no let's don't try to
[5:14] manufacture them what we're going to do
[5:16] is we're going to start in the faith
[5:18] maybe next Sunday after we get through
[5:19] this and and give some
[5:24] examples cuz see you should be born
[5:26] again that's the faith all right then
[5:28] we're going to give some examples of
[5:30] virtue well now that's the way it is
[5:32] trying to manufacture Christianity you
[5:35] can't do it the first thing you got to
[5:38] do is be born again you've got to be
[5:41] changed and when you're changed you
[5:43] become a new creation and now you're
[5:45] getting right now see now you don't have
[5:48] to worry about the feathers it'll take
[5:51] care of itself in other words you're a
[5:53] blackbird when God kills that old man
[5:56] burns that old nature out you don't have
[5:58] the nature of the black Bird anymore you
[6:00] got the nature of peacock well guess
[6:01] what if you were to film this thing
[6:03] you'd see a black bird but he would
[6:05] morph or in
[6:08] morphe God imorph into man you would
[6:11] imorph into a peacock and you would
[6:13] start pushing out you see the black bird
[6:15] feathers fall off and the peacock
[6:16] feathers start coming out cuz that's the
[6:18] nature that's in the bird now it wasn't
[6:21] before but it is now all right now
[6:24] you're getting right now now you don't
[6:26] have to worry about the feathers it'll
[6:27] take care of itself when you're born
[6:29] again yes
[6:30] sir notice paragraph 102 you must be
[6:33] born again look how many times he says
[6:35] You must be born again you got to have
[6:36] that nature change when you're born
[6:38] again you can't be born again without
[6:40] having faith so see on my chart here I
[6:43] got the very Foundation faith is the
[6:45] foundation of all of it for without
[6:48] faith it is impossible to please God so
[6:50] you can't please God with these virtues
[6:53] if you don't have faith right and we're
[6:58] talking baby form faith we're talking
[6:59] about the faith that was delivered to
[7:02] the Saints we're talking about faith
[7:04] just starting in your journey all
[7:06] right and that's what gets me about
[7:10] people 30 years into the journey and
[7:12] they're still on hair and dress and
[7:15] clothes and can't take the people any
[7:17] further where you been I mean you're
[7:20] you're either a black bird sticking
[7:21] peacock feathers in you all this time
[7:24] are you so the Holy Ghost the
[7:26] Holy Ghost is not you are right
[7:29] you the Holy Ghost so much right
[7:32] that's right because you can you can
[7:34] grieve the Holy Spirit like we read
[7:36] Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the Holy
[7:38] Spirit which you can you can grieve him
[7:40] he'll go out here and he'll just let you
[7:42] sit here and
[7:44] Ro and still be a Son of
[7:47] God Adam was a Son of God right he was a
[7:50] fallen Son of God he did a horrible
[7:53] thing but he was still a Son of God okay
[7:57] right and he didn't move any further
[7:58] because of what he
[8:00] did right he was God of the earth and
[8:03] then he lost that
[8:05] godship when he went with Eve and sold
[8:08] she didn't sell us
[8:10] out he sold us out that's right a Son of
[8:13] God that could speak the word and it
[8:16] would
[8:20] happen Son of God that could speak the
[8:22] word and it would
[8:24] happen he fell he fell in flesh see
[8:28] that's why we can fall in flesh that's
[8:30] why we can say no I don't want to open
[8:33] that door God I don't want you in there
[8:35] and he'll say okay my brother R said the
[8:38] Holy Ghost is very timid he's a
[8:40] gentleman he's not going to force his
[8:42] way in a door right you let him in and
[8:45] he'll do what he's supposed to do but if
[8:47] you don't let him in he'll say okay I'm
[8:49] not going to force my way into that door
[8:50] if you don't Pride whatever you want to
[8:52] say you you know put them all together
[8:54] but watch this you can't be boarding in
[8:57] without having faith that's right so you
[8:58] see them my chart here I got the very
[9:00] Foundation faith is the foundation of
[9:02] all of it for without faith is
[9:04] impossible to please God CU remember
[9:08] when you're born again he is pleased to
[9:10] dwell just like we were preaching the
[9:12] other day about Jesus on the River
[9:14] Jordan you on your River Jordan right
[9:17] you receive the baptism of the Holy
[9:18] Ghost God says I am pleased to dwell in
[9:22] that vessel there's something about you
[9:24] that God
[9:26] likes okay he accepts you that Brother D
[9:29] has been preaching he accepts you and
[9:31] says this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[9:33] pleased to dwell but he stops right
[9:34] there then you got to walk that you got
[9:36] to walk right faith is the foundation of
[9:39] all of it for without faith is
[9:41] impossible to please God so God can't
[9:42] say he's pleased with you if you don't
[9:43] have the new birth that's right right
[9:46] okay he that cometh to God must believe
[9:49] that he is what that he's
[9:51] God you got to believe that he's God and
[9:53] that he will do for
[9:55] you it's hard to explain and I'm I'm
[9:58] trying to find that quote where brother
[9:59] Brown says
[10:01] somehow God comes down through all that
[10:04] flesh Spirit goes in there and burns
[10:08] that old man out and puts himself in
[10:11] there and the prophet didn't know how to
[10:13] explain it he said there's some way that
[10:15] God does that and it is
[10:18] unexplainable it really is but you know
[10:21] what faith is the substance of things
[10:24] hoped for the evidence of things you
[10:27] can't see there's a day when that
[10:30] absolute Pillar of Fire came down
[10:33] through like brother Brown said come
[10:35] through all that junk and gave you the
[10:37] new birth now you didn't see that right
[10:40] you saw the manifestation of it but
[10:44] that's exactly what happened like on the
[10:45] day of Pentecost when those clothing
[10:47] tongue of fire sit on their head that's
[10:50] what happened to you at the new birth or
[10:51] they got it different than you
[10:53] did but when you receive the new birth
[10:55] that's exactly what happen God comes in
[10:57] Satan goes out and you you don't open
[11:00] nothing in your body it's not something
[11:02] to whole that's got to go through right
[11:05] God works on your desire that's right
[11:07] where does the desire come from your
[11:09] spirit real Satan Soul it comes from it
[11:14] comes from you brother Brown said you
[11:16] hear from you heard from your theophany
[11:17] or I like to say you heard like I said
[11:20] my little quote that I got that you
[11:22] responded to the part of the word that
[11:24] God knew you'd respond to he had it in
[11:26] the Bible before the foundation of the
[11:27] world and when that responded to
[11:30] you or when you responded to it right
[11:34] when you responded to the word there's
[11:37] the connection there's the Searing out
[11:39] of Satan s e a r like you sear something
[11:42] on a grill the Searing out of Satan and
[11:46] the putting in of God right all right so
[11:48] there you have representation of
[11:51] predestination we got a discussion of
[11:52] this yesterday uh and that doesn't make
[11:55] you always was eternal but that part of
[11:58] you always was was eternal it's kind of
[12:00] hard to explain but I can explain it to
[12:02] y'all but into an unlearned crowd you
[12:04] can't really explain it because it is a
[12:07] representation there is a place in this
[12:09] word that you are going to come
[12:12] to if not God didn't know what he's
[12:15] doing cuz you were predestinated for the
[12:18] foundation of the world Jesus come to
[12:20] show you that you had an inheritance not
[12:22] give you one he he come to show you you
[12:25] had one and to be the door
[12:29] of the way back in cuz remember if
[12:32] you're to be redeemed it means you were
[12:35] here you went to here and now you're
[12:38] going back to here not over here you're
[12:39] going right back to here Redemption is
[12:42] not replacement Redemption is not
[12:44] dropping this and picking up this
[12:45] redemption's not even dropping this and
[12:47] it was right here and it fell and I lay
[12:49] it over there that's not Redemption
[12:52] Redemption is putting it back in its
[12:55] position and our rightful position got
[12:57] sold out by Adam
[13:00] in through adultery that he committed
[13:02] adultery and he accepted
[13:04] that God accepted our adultery cuz we
[13:06] committed adultery remember we were born
[13:09] to Satan and he was he was our
[13:13] husband it's not the old man don't have
[13:15] to die
[13:18] then that's what I was talking to the
[13:20] brother you can't you've only got faith
[13:22] or doubt in your
[13:23] soul either God's there or the devil's
[13:25] there one of the two there's not both of
[13:27] them there at the same time that's right
[13:29] right so in your soul you were not
[13:33] Eternal but there was an eternal
[13:36] part everybody understand what I'm
[13:38] saying listen to me there was an eternal
[13:39] part of
[13:41] you that was hidden in this word right
[13:46] because remember it's a thought God had
[13:48] the
[13:49] thought then it had to be spoken by
[13:53] somebody in the Bible then it had to be
[13:55] spoken by a preacher while you were
[13:57] standing here alive
[13:59] cuz remember brother R says it's not the
[14:01] person that comes predestinated
[14:02] eternally go from God but the seed or
[14:05] word everybody talking about the seed
[14:06] seed seed simply the seed is a word
[14:09] there is no
[14:11] germ see we go back to the sperm and
[14:14] eggs and all this stuff and we get all
[14:15] wrapped up into this human stuff
[14:17] remember none of that was supposed to
[14:20] be let's just be honest there was to be
[14:23] no sex there was to be no male sperm
[14:26] meeting female
[14:27] sperm
[14:29] that's the original that's right that's
[14:31] the original it was supposed to be
[14:34] spoken and then Eve would surely have
[14:37] something to do with it but it was
[14:38] spoken word not a sensation not a not an
[14:42] arousal come on let's be honest here but
[14:45] remember that's what we fell to cuz Adam
[14:48] accepted what Eve thought she was doing
[14:51] right so to be spoken word children we
[14:54] got to come back to not a
[14:57] seed male female germ sperm
[15:01] no the seed is the word of God that's
[15:03] what the Bible
[15:05] says so the seed's laying in here not in
[15:08] here but God knew one day though that
[15:11] the seed that was laying in here was
[15:14] going to go in
[15:16] here in other words brother brand he
[15:19] wouldn't have said um that God somehow
[15:21] come down through all
[15:24] that but see brother brandom in his
[15:26] Revelation he comes up to a higher point
[15:27] of Revelation he said you wasn't born on
[15:30] any certain day sons of God were always
[15:32] sons of God and he starts talking about
[15:33] that well that's right if that eternal
[15:35] life that you have come from God which
[15:38] it did had to that was
[15:41] eternal God did write your name in a
[15:43] book and you know what God did have
[15:45] something with you getting
[15:49] here God did have something with you
[15:51] getting here it was your mom and daddy
[15:53] that committed the app but look at all
[15:55] the germs and sperms and all that they
[15:56] had to go through to get you here MH
[15:59] millions and billions back from your
[16:01] great great great great great great
[16:02] great
[16:03] grandfather so it is predestinated
[16:06] that's right but you can't in a small in
[16:08] a group that's just coming up in the
[16:11] Lord you can't just say you always was
[16:13] eternal you never was born any a certain
[16:15] day you got this seed laying in you
[16:17] because people would just relax and go
[16:19] well I always had it I'm always this I'm
[16:21] always that I'm I'm in the
[16:24] message no you can't take salvation out
[16:26] of this brother brand there's no way he
[16:28] could take the blood of Jesus Christ
[16:30] dying on the cross out of his
[16:33] message but we do have to come to a
[16:35] realization that the real you didn't do
[16:38] it cuz if the real you did it you're
[16:41] still
[16:42] lost right if the real you did
[16:46] it cuz remember that Genesis 1 126 and
[16:49] 27 never cursed Never Smoke never
[16:53] committed
[16:54] adultery never had one mark of sin if it
[16:57] has one mark of sin then it's not part
[16:59] of that Genesis 12627 but you were a
[17:02] part of that and to me the Genesis 126
[17:04] and 27 is the word right cuz it's a word
[17:08] body that we're looking at not a body
[17:10] that Mom and Daddy brought but because
[17:11] of the Fall to go back to Redemption to
[17:16] go back to Redemption you got to go back
[17:18] through the blood of Jesus Christ right
[17:21] if not if we didn't need the blood of
[17:22] Jesus Christ he could have just said
[17:24] Nicodemus me and you were always
[17:26] Eternal no he said Nicodemus you should
[17:29] need something new because what you got
[17:31] is
[17:33] old simple is that you read my mind
[17:37] remember the oh God
[17:40] the that's corre the word of God that's
[17:43] right and that's what's Eternal and that
[17:46] portion sure of God's word that pertains
[17:49] to me for my age that's what strikes in
[17:53] me and that's what was eternal I mean
[17:56] listen listen everybody did did you not
[17:58] react one day you reacted to somebody
[18:02] preaching the word of God not reading
[18:04] the newspaper not reading a good story
[18:07] somewhere not reading about this one or
[18:09] that you were convicted by what a man
[18:11] was preaching from the word of
[18:14] God there's the
[18:18] seed now you can say it laid dormant in
[18:20] you you can say whatever you want to it
[18:22] laid dormant in your understanding cuz
[18:25] the word's not dormant right but now you
[18:27] see brother around he say the word laid
[18:29] dormant it was dead it laid in the Tomb
[18:31] well that was the word of God laying
[18:32] there that's right right but when the
[18:34] life come to it it quickened that life
[18:36] and brought it back to life same way
[18:38] with you and I it
[18:40] quickened the word that you
[18:43] held can ever be born again without
[18:45] listening to the word
[18:47] first right and the life has to come
[18:50] through the body now why in the world
[18:51] would brother R say the seed life hasn't
[18:53] come through the body if you already had
[18:55] the seed I about to ask you
[18:59] CE Simplicity well they're trying to
[19:02] make this and and
[19:04] look I'll tell there when it's not the
[19:07] thing's not on but there is a truth to
[19:09] that if you'll really understand you
[19:12] were always Eternal you are always in
[19:15] the mind of God you always were going to
[19:17] be a Son of God if not God had a new
[19:19] thought right but you got to realize you
[19:22] were lost first right then you got to
[19:24] realize you got to get these virtues
[19:26] working in your life that's right when
[19:28] brother randam got a revelation of the
[19:30] seals did it reveal to him that the real
[19:32] you didn't do
[19:34] it and it's not that you come to a place
[19:36] where the real you didn't do it no the
[19:38] real you never done
[19:40] it but remember this you is the one you
[19:42] got to deal with first if you deal with
[19:44] this you first the one that Mom and
[19:46] Daddy brought that brought all the
[19:47] memory reason conscious faction
[19:48] imagination and all these things if you
[19:50] deal with that first then you can
[19:53] see that God did predestinate you and
[19:57] you did have a part in the word and you
[19:59] were always a Son of God can is that
[20:01] okay I me but but you were lost the
[20:03] Bible say you were
[20:05] lost Paul say such were some of you
[20:09] children of Wrath he said that's right
[20:12] he didn't say you were set over here
[20:13] aside but in God's mind you were set
[20:15] over here aside there is a
[20:19] separation CU that Genesis 126 and 27 is
[20:22] only the people that receive the new
[20:24] birth in this world that is not the Old
[20:26] Testament saints that is not um
[20:28] Nicodemus that is not the foolish virgin
[20:31] that is not the
[20:32] 144,000 that is the people that God knew
[20:37] would want to be his children more than
[20:39] any person on the face of the
[20:42] Earth
[20:44] amen exactly I was thinking the Jews are
[20:48] part of God's family true but he married
[20:52] a gentile you don't marry within your
[20:54] family even today you pick somebody
[20:57] outside that's right that's
[21:01] good but remember too Abraham was never
[21:05] called a Son of God Abraham was called a
[21:06] friend of God that's right now he'll be
[21:10] given eternal life right he'll be given
[21:14] eternal life because of what was covered
[21:16] under the blood of bulls and goats God
[21:18] honored that but now Abraham sure he's
[21:21] going to have a place in the city
[21:22] because he's the father of our faith but
[21:24] he's not going to have a place in the
[21:26] city to
[21:27] live
[21:28] I don't believe that only the people
[21:31] that live in there are going to be the
[21:33] bride and the
[21:35] 144,000 now they may be see because the
[21:37] Bible says that that the foundation of
[21:39] the Apostles well they're not going to
[21:41] be Abraham's not going to be on one
[21:42] corner of the of the of the city that's
[21:45] carinal but he's not going to be in one
[21:47] corner of the city holding this holding
[21:49] it up no it's what it's the foundation
[21:51] of their faith right it's the foundation
[21:53] of what they brought I'm preaching we're
[21:55] not in Sunday school so hey let's get
[21:57] back to that
[22:00] when you're a skeptic of the Bible when
[22:02] you're skeptic of the word being
[22:04] right you just might as well stay back
[22:07] until first you believe it hold back
[22:11] what is sin unbelief there's only two
[22:13] elements that control the human being
[22:15] right here it is there only two elements
[22:16] that control the human being that's
[22:18] either doubt or faith and before you
[22:21] were a doubter right right so was God in
[22:26] there no but God was in here and you
[22:29] were in here right you were
[22:32] here right this is the seed this is
[22:35] where we should have been born
[22:38] from preaching again all right one of
[22:42] the other you're possessed of one that
[22:43] dominates your
[22:45] life now tell me when you were out in
[22:48] the world of sin there was not a part of
[22:49] God in you anywhere right there was a
[22:52] representation that you was going to
[22:53] come to it but when you did what you did
[22:56] the Bible say I told the brother I said
[22:57] said I got one scripture that says God
[22:59] will not dwell in an unclean vessel so
[23:01] where is that seed when I'm out there in
[23:03] a bed of adultery or out there
[23:04] committing a crime or out there cursing
[23:08] the name of God right where is God in
[23:10] any of that now God had it laying
[23:15] waiting waiting on you to come to a
[23:18] place then brother Brown said
[23:21] somehow God comes down through all that
[23:24] and give you a new birth now to me that
[23:26] I agree that that always was eternal God
[23:28] knew you'd always you'd be that he knew
[23:30] the day you'd come to it but you
[23:32] didn't right you're possess of one that
[23:36] dominates your
[23:38] life just depends on how much Faith you
[23:41] have is how high you can rise that's
[23:43] right all right and now Faith does the
[23:45] rest of it Faith does the rest so you
[23:47] got to have faith first to get virtue
[23:49] all right all Christianity all you are
[23:51] all you'll ever be is based on faith in
[23:54] the word that's the reason I believe the
[23:57] word all right all right then he says
[23:59] first you must be born again then when
[24:00] you're born again you have faith you
[24:02] believe the word until you're born again
[24:03] you'll argue against it if you're just
[24:05] religiously inclined you got a little
[24:07] human knowledge that you should do right
[24:09] you'll never be able to agree on the
[24:10] word of God you'll never do it got to be
[24:12] born again and born again it produces
[24:14] Faith all right then after you get Faith
[24:16] that's right here f a i he's got it on
[24:18] the pyramid then you're just in position
[24:20] of
[24:22] growing now there's where the thing
[24:24] comes in this morning we're going to
[24:25] talk about now talking about a house
[24:27] Foundation what is the foundation of
[24:29] Christianity faith in the word of God
[24:31] not faith in a man faith in the word of
[24:33] God all right that's your foundation
[24:35] then you begin to grow then you start
[24:37] you begin to add to this Foundation all
[24:40] right now here's what we do what's the
[24:43] first thing have faith and be born again
[24:45] that's laying the foundation then after
[24:47] we lay the foundation secondly you add
[24:48] to your foundation add to your faith
[24:51] first you have faith then you add virtue
[24:53] to your faith that's the next column
[24:55] first pour your foundation
[24:59] then to your faith add virtue now right
[25:01] there knocks a lot of us down yes sir
[25:03] add virtue to your faith that doesn't
[25:04] just mean Liv in a Virg in life you know
[25:06] like the woman or a man and so forth
[25:08] that doesn't have nothing to do with it
[25:11] all right so we see
[25:18] that that's it yeah that's the last one
[25:21] okay but you got to have faith now right
[25:24] there knocks a lot of us off so add to
[25:26] your faith virtue so you got have you
[25:29] got to have
[25:30] faith to believe that God's going to
[25:32] give you virtue you don't have faith
[25:34] that God's going to give you virtue then
[25:36] you need to stop right there pack it in
[25:38] a little bit more you know what take a
[25:40] little bit the foundation may be a
[25:42] little wobbly but it's a foundation but
[25:44] you got to go over there and pack that
[25:45] corner or pack that side over there and
[25:47] get it real
[25:49] firm that you're part of God you're his
[25:52] you're his child and once being child
[25:54] and being in the family you can have all
[25:56] these other attributes
[25:58] all right called virtue knowledge
[26:00] Temperance patience so think on faith
[26:02] and we'll read some about faith next
[26:04] Sunday all right but add to your faith
[26:08] add to what you believe
[26:24] virtue bless you
[26:26] bud
[26:30] thank
[26:31] you
