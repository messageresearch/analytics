[7:34] and it says i have set the lord always

[7:58] corruption
[7:59] that will show me the path of life in
[8:02] thy presence is fullness of joy at thy
[8:05] right hand there are pleasures
[8:08] forevermore
[8:10] amen we're gonna go to
[8:12] matthew chapter six
[8:14] and we begin it
[8:16] verse 22 and it says
[8:19] the light of the body is the eye
[8:21] if therefore that eye
[8:23] be single the whole body is full of
[8:26] light but if thine eye be evil thy whole
[8:29] body shall be full of darkness if
[8:32] therefore the light
[8:34] if therefore the light that is in thee
[8:36] be darkness how great is that darkness
[8:39] amen god bless you tonight you may be
[8:41] seated
[8:43] and
[8:49] here
[8:50] then
[8:52] give you a little definitions here
[8:56] definition for the word
[8:58] focus
[8:59] it says the main
[9:01] or central part of something
[9:03] especially of attention or interest
[9:07] to adapt to the prevailing level
[9:10] of light
[9:11] and become able to see clearly
[9:15] and it says to cause light to come
[9:17] together
[9:18] at a point
[9:20] and so that's the that's the focus
[9:24] and
[9:24] and the message look
[9:27] this is from 1963 brother rams speaking
[9:30] of shooting his gun he was trying to
[9:33] trying to get his target set and he was
[9:36] shooting and he couldn't get it to line
[9:38] up the way he wanted to because he could
[9:39] drive tax and all of a sudden he
[9:41] couldn't and you know he's talking about
[9:43] he talked to the winchester people and
[9:46] it says
[9:47] he says now if i look to what the
[9:50] winchester company said which is
[9:52] supposed to be that
[9:54] that made the gun
[9:56] then i'd have listened to them but i
[9:59] know different
[10:00] because he had seen that because he had
[10:01] been able to shoot drive tax at 50 yards
[10:04] with that gun and then they were saying
[10:05] you could only make a one-inch
[10:07] things one inch circle at 25 yards is
[10:10] the best you could get out of it and he
[10:11] said well i know i've done better
[10:12] because i've shot the gun
[10:14] he said now if i look to the church and
[10:16] they say oh my days those days are gone
[10:21] them days is gone and there's no such
[10:24] thing as that
[10:25] and see see where where you'd be
[10:28] it'd be plumb off target
[10:31] but if he is ever god
[10:34] he is still god
[10:35] he always was god
[10:37] and he can't be nothing else but god
[10:40] and he is god eternal
[10:42] therefore we want to look to that target
[10:45] not what target the church is shooting
[10:47] at but what target that christ is
[10:50] shooting at
[10:51] he said we look for christ to appear the
[10:53] same jesus he said when he was on the
[10:55] earth a little while in the world seeth
[10:58] me no more yet ye shall see me for i'll
[11:00] be with you to the end of the world that
[11:03] same one who could direct the word and
[11:05] be the word and direct it right straight
[11:08] onto the target that same lord jesus is
[11:11] here this morning in the form of the
[11:12] holy ghost to direct our thoughts and
[11:14] focus down
[11:16] his word
[11:17] to one true and living god to one
[11:19] purpose to one achievement
[11:21] and if we'll just let him do it he will
[11:24] focus the word right into a place
[11:27] that'll prove
[11:28] that he's the same yesterday today and
[11:30] forever
[11:31] depends on what you want to look at
[11:34] he said we must focus our lives
[11:37] not what somebody else says
[11:39] but focus our lives to him and he is the
[11:43] word see and if we get our lives lined
[11:46] with the word
[11:48] then the word in our life becomes the
[11:50] same
[11:51] he said if you abide in me and my word
[11:53] in you
[11:55] then ask what you will it'll be granted
[11:56] to you
[11:58] verily i say unto you if you say to this
[12:00] mountain be moved and don't doubt in
[12:02] your heart but believe
[12:04] that that
[12:05] what you have said will come to pass you
[12:08] can have what you have seen
[12:10] oh my not what i said
[12:13] what you said
[12:15] you can have because you and he become
[12:19] the same
[12:20] because the mind that was in christ is
[12:22] in you
[12:23] and the mind that was in christ was to
[12:25] fulfill the father's word which he was
[12:28] the word there you are then you and the
[12:31] word are focused in together you become
[12:34] a living unit of god
[12:36] how great
[12:38] so i i want to speak on this tonight and
[12:42] i
[12:43] the one the one scripture when i was
[12:45] thinking about this the one scripture
[12:47] that come to my mind
[12:50] was paul i'm sorry it was david
[12:52] and he said i've set the lord always
[12:54] before me
[12:57] and you know that was that was the first
[12:58] thing when you're speaking of a target
[13:00] when you're focusing on something that's
[13:01] what that's what come to mind i've
[13:03] always set the lord before me
[13:05] and that's the main that's the main
[13:07] focus
[13:08] brother graham said he's the prince
[13:09] brothers he's the principal theme of the
[13:11] bible of the word and he said if you
[13:13] can't see christ in every verse he said
[13:16] then go back and read it again because
[13:17] you've missed it
[13:20] and so this this is
[13:22] the principle theme of our lives
[13:24] there's nothing greater
[13:32] and
[13:33] so when we look
[13:36] you know i i have it i have a desire
[13:41] you know
[13:45] you know we we we live in such a late
[13:47] hour
[13:48] and we see the condition that
[13:49] everything's in
[13:52] but you know paul said that we we are
[13:55] compassed with so great a cloud of
[13:57] witnesses
[13:58] that's right
[14:00] when we see the what the the great
[14:03] heroes of faith that that paul wrote
[14:05] about and and he wrote about all the
[14:07] great things that that they had done
[14:10] and when he went through all of that and
[14:12] he got finished
[14:14] and then he stood there and said yeah
[14:16] they without us cannot be made perfect
[14:21] so you know it it behooves us to
[14:23] understand the day and the hour which we
[14:25] live
[14:28] the scripture tells us he said that we
[14:30] ought to give a more earnest heed to the
[14:32] words which we've hurt
[14:35] and so we understand that the day and
[14:36] the hour that we live in that we need to
[14:38] focus
[14:40] because to in the day and hour it
[14:43] to scatter your mind it's to scatter
[14:45] your focus
[14:47] it's it's for not to have have your
[14:49] vision but you know thank god we've been
[14:52] given uh the lens
[14:55] of the word
[14:58] and
[14:59] you know to help us focus
[15:02] because you know it take it takes light
[15:05] to see
[15:08] you know if you want you know if we
[15:09] turned out all the lights in here today
[15:11] and it was complete pitch black you know
[15:13] what you wouldn't be focusing on
[15:15] anything
[15:16] there's there's no way to focus
[15:18] so it takes light to focus on something
[15:22] and if you have light then you know all
[15:24] it takes is just one little glimmer of
[15:26] light in absolute darkness and you have
[15:28] something to focus on it catches your
[15:30] attention
[15:32] and you know what what a great day and
[15:34] hour that we live in because we've had
[15:35] the full light come
[15:38] you know they down through the down
[15:40] through time you know the through the
[15:42] dark ages and you know the they had very
[15:44] little light
[15:46] but you know they held on to the light
[15:47] that they had
[15:50] and you know when because we understand
[15:52] that that it was that through the time
[15:55] the seed was to go into the ground
[15:58] but you know if the seed went into the
[15:59] ground but there was a time for a
[16:01] harvest
[16:02] the seed would come back and you know
[16:04] what we and and we see luther had his
[16:07] had his day when you know it started to
[16:08] have a little bit more light
[16:10] and it was a little bit more liked
[16:13] but thank god we live in the in the and
[16:16] because it's the great and terrible day
[16:19] it's it's a great day of absolute light
[16:22] but it's a day of absolute darkness
[16:26] we live in we live in a world of
[16:28] contrast that that you see all of the
[16:30] the light and the darkness
[16:33] and jesus is speaking of the of the
[16:35] pharisees
[16:36] and he's speaking to him and and he says
[16:40] and he's speaking he says the light of
[16:42] the body is the eye
[16:44] so when he's speaking to the disciples
[16:46] talking about them he said you know if
[16:48] your eye be single
[16:50] he said then the whole body shall be
[16:52] full of light
[16:54] so if you if you have a focus
[16:57] on something
[16:59] he said then he said then then the
[17:00] body's full of light because you see
[17:03] what what to see to bring the light in
[17:06] to see the light
[17:07] but
[17:08] and in contrast he said but if thou be
[17:10] evil
[17:14] see you can only have one
[17:17] only have one
[17:18] uh source of light
[17:21] you know brother brown was speaking of
[17:22] eve and and you know he was talking
[17:24] about being in the garden of eden and
[17:26] you know he said she thought there was
[17:28] more than one way
[17:30] he you know she thought there was more
[17:31] than one way that that things could take
[17:33] place and you know and she had our own
[17:35] idea because she listened to the serpent
[17:37] but you know it brought death
[17:39] there was only one way that was going to
[17:41] come and you can't have but one way
[17:44] and the in and and the day and the hour
[17:46] that we live in we see so many people
[17:48] and and there's a is a great darkness
[17:51] upon the earth upon the upon the world
[17:53] but you know there's great light but the
[17:55] problem is is when people hold on to
[17:58] hold on to darkness and they claim it to
[18:01] be liked
[18:02] or when you've had light and you don't
[18:04] continue on in the light
[18:07] well you know he said but if we walk in
[18:09] the light as he is in the light but if
[18:11] you don't walk in the light anymore he
[18:13] said how great is that darkness
[18:17] because you know that light can be
[18:18] darkness because you can walk up to a
[18:20] certain point and then you quit
[18:22] then how how great is that darkness
[18:28] so we see the the great and dreadful
[18:31] time that we live in that that are the
[18:33] things that have had that is happening
[18:35] today
[18:39] and you know
[18:41] the the person that
[18:43] comes to my mind when when i was looking
[18:45] at this is you know there was a a a man
[18:49] the scripture tells us about
[18:51] and
[18:52] this is this is the from
[18:54] the message leadership and i
[18:56] quote and brother i'm talking about he
[18:58] said he's speaking of the rich young
[18:59] ruler he said this man
[19:01] when he come down the re the young ruler
[19:04] we talked about all religious and belong
[19:06] to church and everything fine educated a
[19:09] fine businessman and everything
[19:13] when he come to the end of the road he
[19:15] began to scream
[19:17] there's nowhere to step
[19:20] he said where's his leadership
[19:26] he had been led by his church which is
[19:28] dead
[19:29] he had been led by the dead world and
[19:31] there's not wasn't nothing for him to
[19:33] step into but what the world had
[19:36] prepared for it hail
[19:40] now you know nothing think of think of
[19:42] this young man
[19:46] you know he had had a great life
[19:49] and he had a great desire
[19:53] and and here he was he was walking and
[19:55] and he come to jesus because he saw he
[19:58] saw how who jesus was there was
[20:00] something that caught his attention
[20:03] and so he came to jesus one day and he
[20:06] said good master
[20:09] he said what is it that i must do to
[20:11] inherit eternal life
[20:14] and so he come to jesus he saw the
[20:16] condition that he was in
[20:19] and he saw who jesus was and he saw that
[20:22] there was something that he needed
[20:25] and so he came he came to jesus to get
[20:28] what he needed
[20:30] and so something drew him there and then
[20:32] when jesus began to speak to him he said
[20:35] well follow the commandments
[20:38] he said he said well lord i've done this
[20:40] since since my birth
[20:42] he said all my childhood i've lived the
[20:44] law he said i've done everything i was
[20:46] supposed to do
[20:48] he said i've done everything and i've
[20:50] lived a perfect life you know because
[20:52] whatever the law said i've lived it just
[20:54] as close and done everything that i
[20:56] could and you know jesus loved him
[21:00] because there was something about him
[21:02] that he was sincere about
[21:04] there was insincerity that he had and
[21:07] jesus saw the kind of person that he was
[21:11] and looking upon him the bible says that
[21:13] jesus loved him
[21:16] but told him he said he said son he said
[21:18] you've got one problem
[21:22] he said now you need to give up
[21:23] everything that you own
[21:25] you need to sell everything get rid of
[21:27] all of this
[21:28] and he said and come and follow me
[21:31] he said so he had an opportunity to walk
[21:35] in front of of the lord and and ask what
[21:38] he had need of and the lord told him
[21:40] he got his answer before the lord what
[21:43] he needed
[21:44] and the lord told him and he walked away
[21:48] the scripture said he turned away
[21:49] because and he was very sorrowful
[21:52] because he had great possessions
[21:54] and he decided to walk away
[21:58] now you know there's no place in the
[21:59] scripture now if you find it you let me
[22:01] know but i can't find one place in the
[22:04] scripture that said that he ever walked
[22:06] away and he quit following the
[22:07] commandments
[22:09] there was no place where he quit going
[22:10] to the synagogue and he quit playing his
[22:12] ties and all of the other things that he
[22:14] had done all the way he was just the
[22:16] same kind of because the scripture tells
[22:18] us and brother i'm talking about he
[22:19] lived the same kind of religious life
[22:22] he still lived as a law to the t he done
[22:25] the exact same thing but you know what
[22:27] he had already cut himself off
[22:29] he'd already sent away his day of grace
[22:31] but he stood there and lived the same
[22:33] kind of life just as religious as he
[22:35] ever was
[22:37] he done the exact same thing why because
[22:40] there was there was his focus his point
[22:42] to look at and it said he said come and
[22:44] get rid of all these things and come
[22:46] follow me but you know what he couldn't
[22:47] do that
[22:49] and so here he is he sells he he sells
[22:52] off the lord jesus
[22:56] he could have sold his he could have
[22:58] sold his earthly possessions
[23:01] and took the lord
[23:03] but you know what he he valued all of
[23:06] the things of this earth or this world
[23:08] more than he did the lord jesus
[23:11] he valued this more
[23:14] when the scripture tells us later on
[23:16] that he that he grew and had so much
[23:18] gain that he had to tear down his barns
[23:20] and build bigger to hold it all
[23:24] no no no no but he was still religious
[23:27] he still walked a religious life he's
[23:29] still done all the things yet he's
[23:31] already cut off
[23:34] and then we see later on in the
[23:35] scripture you know then then he had his
[23:37] then he said well so just take your ease
[23:39] because you know look at all the
[23:41] blessings that you've got
[23:44] he come to place well look look at all
[23:46] the things that i've got i'm just i'm
[23:47] just so full and and blessed and
[23:49] everything i don't have to worry about
[23:50] anything
[23:53] but you know what he did not take into
[23:55] account that one day that he would have
[23:56] to give an account for his soul
[24:00] and what was it where was the place
[24:02] there was no place bound for him to
[24:03] stand
[24:04] there was no place found for him and
[24:07] there he is standing and all these
[24:08] things and there was not one thing that
[24:10] he could find that he could hold on to
[24:12] there would well because his riches
[24:14] wouldn't do him any good and everything
[24:16] else that he had done in his life
[24:18] wouldn't do him one bit of good
[24:20] no matter how religious you live you can
[24:22] live a religious life and you don't and
[24:24] just follow because you know as as
[24:27] brother donny reagan said one time he
[24:28] said the message has produced more thou
[24:31] shalt nights than the law of moses ever
[24:33] could
[24:34] and he said what do we do we have people
[24:36] they don't mind living living a life
[24:40] why because while they think they think
[24:42] that they're gonna they're gonna just
[24:44] walk and do all these things but works
[24:46] will never get you in works will never
[24:48] get you anywhere
[24:51] works will never never god god is not
[24:54] god is not pleased with all your works
[24:57] god's not impressed with all your works
[25:00] but you know one thing that god is
[25:01] wanting he's wanting somebody that'll
[25:03] take him by faith and follow him
[25:06] when they sell out everything else when
[25:08] there's nothing else that'll hold you
[25:10] but him
[25:12] i don't i don't want anything because
[25:15] that's that song that
[25:17] that man was that uh
[25:19] i'll stand for jesus
[25:21] and let the world go by amen
[25:24] you know i don't want to own one thing
[25:26] that i can't leave behind he said i want
[25:28] to be free to sell through the sky
[25:31] that's why i'm walking with jesus i'm
[25:33] let the world go by
[25:34] i don't want anything to hold me back
[25:37] why because you know there's too many
[25:38] things it's too late of an hour it's too
[25:41] close for us to give up now
[25:45] it's too close
[25:48] you know can you can you imagine
[25:51] i was thinking about this day can you
[25:53] imagine
[25:54] caleb
[25:55] and joshua
[25:57] when they went into that land and they
[25:59] got the promise they got the evidence of
[26:01] the promise given to them and they went
[26:03] into that land and they saw what their
[26:05] inheritance was
[26:07] and they brought back the cluster of
[26:09] grapes and all the all the other things
[26:11] and brought back it brought back the
[26:12] evidence brought back the report
[26:14] their testimony was to that they could
[26:17] take that land and they had seen what
[26:19] was in there and he had a vision
[26:21] caleb had a vision of what his land was
[26:24] or what his what his mountain was when
[26:26] he laid eyes on it and you know he never
[26:28] lost that vision he never changed from
[26:30] that no matter what he got hold and he
[26:33] got stoop-shouldered and he got
[26:34] gray-headed and everything else you know
[26:36] he never lost his vision of what was his
[26:39] he never gave up on that when he told
[26:42] joshua he said you know he said i've
[26:43] waited 40 years on this he said i was 45
[26:46] when i went in he said i'm 85 he said
[26:48] i'm just as strong as i was then and he
[26:50] said this is my land he said give me my
[26:54] mountain
[26:55] you know he had to walk all that time
[26:57] and had that vision and all that time
[26:59] you know what he was ready to go in and
[27:01] take his land
[27:04] can you imagine every day waking up and
[27:06] he was out there sharpening his sword
[27:08] why because he was ready for a battle
[27:11] god had given him something and you know
[27:12] what he sharpened his sword he's right i
[27:15] don't know when i'm gonna go in there
[27:16] but i'm gonna take it
[27:19] he was ready to go one because it's like
[27:21] well you you know caleb you're starting
[27:23] to stoop over a little bit you're
[27:24] starting to get a little bit slower
[27:26] that's all right when i get there i'll
[27:28] take care of business
[27:30] it didn't slow him down any
[27:33] but you know he was ready to go all that
[27:35] time and watching all of those people
[27:39] listen as brother preached those 10 line
[27:41] preachers
[27:43] had to listen to them them can you
[27:45] imagine having to sit and listen to them
[27:47] people
[27:50] haven't listened to them people get up
[27:52] and say that and it's like and that you
[27:53] know and joshua and caleb got up before
[27:56] all the people said and tried to steal
[27:57] the people and tell them listen
[27:59] don't listen to them
[28:02] where god has given it to us
[28:05] and of all the things that god has
[28:06] brought us through to this point he's
[28:09] more than able to bring us in
[28:13] you know he had to sit there and watch
[28:15] all of those men
[28:17] that had give a bad report
[28:20] had a had a terrible testimony of what
[28:22] they had seen
[28:24] and then when they brought the evidence
[28:25] back to the children of israel and it
[28:27] sat right in front of them and they saw
[28:32] no no how many how many times have you
[28:34] seen grapes that it takes two people to
[28:36] carry
[28:38] here they hear these great big cluster
[28:40] grapes that they had to bring over from
[28:41] the other side it's like this is what's
[28:43] there
[28:46] no no everybody's standing there in awe
[28:49] wow look at this
[28:50] they're amazed at what they're looking
[28:52] at but we can't do we can't go in there
[28:56] because their testimony was we look like
[28:59] grasshoppers and they're psyched
[29:01] that was their testimony that's what
[29:03] they saw
[29:05] not what caleb said
[29:09] and it's like well were you there i was
[29:11] were you there were you there
[29:14] i was there
[29:17] i know what i'm talking about
[29:20] no they didn't they but they wouldn't
[29:21] but they wouldn't listen
[29:24] and here's caleb and can you imagine
[29:26] having to walk through the desert and
[29:27] you have to put up with all these people
[29:29] and watching them die one by one and
[29:31] thinking well you know what the more
[29:33] these people die the closer we're
[29:34] getting that's right
[29:37] when jesus when the lord told joshua and
[29:39] you know and he went and told him he
[29:41] said listen he said he said your
[29:42] children
[29:44] he said you say that we would be a prey
[29:46] in there he said but they're going to
[29:47] raise up and take that land he said but
[29:49] your carcasses will rot in the
[29:50] wilderness
[29:53] your carcasses will rot in the
[29:54] wilderness and there was caleb standing
[29:57] there watching those people drop off
[29:59] like flies
[30:02] and just like and he was out there
[30:03] talking to young folks after sharpening
[30:05] that sword
[30:07] let me tell you what i saw
[30:09] let me tell you what jehovah said
[30:14] it's like well you know what y'all can
[30:15] y'all can rot over here if you want to
[30:16] but i got a promise over there
[30:19] he never lost his vision of what he saw
[30:24] and and so it's it's us we have to we
[30:27] have to keep our vision
[30:30] second corinthians 4 i love this he says
[30:34] verse 16 says for which cause we fake
[30:37] not
[30:38] but through our outward man perish
[30:40] though our outward man perish yet in the
[30:42] inner man is renewed day by day
[30:45] for our light affliction which is but
[30:48] for a moment worketh for us a far more
[30:50] exceeding and eternal weight of glory
[30:53] while we look not at the things which
[30:55] are seen but at the things which are not
[30:57] seen for the things which are seen are
[30:59] temporal but the things which are not
[31:01] seen
[31:02] are eternal
[31:04] so we see you know the things because
[31:06] caleb had his eyes on something that was
[31:09] beyond what they could see
[31:11] he had experienced something
[31:13] and you know and many times you hear
[31:15] people they get up and they they talk
[31:17] about things and you know what it's
[31:18] something that they've never experienced
[31:21] you know how can how can you judge
[31:23] something if you've never experienced it
[31:24] for yourself
[31:27] many people you know they say well the
[31:28] holy ghost is not real or brother
[31:30] branham's all right how do you know
[31:34] you know what i tell you until you've
[31:35] experienced for yourself how can you
[31:37] judge these things
[31:40] why because if you're just living off of
[31:42] a carnal reality
[31:45] a carnal thought
[31:46] how do you know
[31:48] if you've never put god to the test how
[31:49] do you know what god can do
[31:52] if you've never trusted him god how do
[31:54] you know what god can do
[32:00] no because
[32:02] aunt susie said something or some
[32:04] preacher somewhere said something no you
[32:06] need to find out for yourself
[32:08] you need to prove god for yourself you
[32:10] need to experience it for yourself it's
[32:12] a personal revelation it's a personal
[32:14] experience you can't you can't get on
[32:16] somebody else just because brother dale
[32:18] might have had the virtues and and all
[32:20] these different things you know what it
[32:22] ain't it don't mean that anybody else
[32:23] has them
[32:25] it doesn't matter you know because you
[32:26] know what we're not going to get in
[32:27] because brother dale's got to get me in
[32:29] pass he ain't going to get you in
[32:33] mama ain't going to get you in daddy
[32:35] ain't going to get you in
[32:37] you got to have experience for yourself
[32:40] you've got to have a token you've got to
[32:42] have you've got to have a general a
[32:44] genuine experience with jesus christ for
[32:46] yourself you got to know it for yourself
[32:49] you've got to know beyond a shadow of a
[32:51] doubt
[32:54] not waiting on somebody else
[32:57] we can't we can't have just
[33:04] it it just it's got to be real
[33:08] you just can't play church
[33:11] it's got to be real
[33:14] and i i want i want to know that i know
[33:17] that i know that i know
[33:20] i want to know
[33:22] i can't get any people people ask you
[33:24] know do you think this person has the
[33:26] holy ghost do you think that person has
[33:27] the holy ghost
[33:28] do you think this person you know what i
[33:30] i'm not worried about whether everybody
[33:31] else i won't know if i got it
[33:34] there ain't no i you know because you
[33:36] know what even if because you know if i
[33:37] did know who did and did not have the
[33:39] holy ghost you know what that doesn't
[33:41] mean that i've got it
[33:43] that don't mean it's going to get me in
[33:49] but you got to know for yourself
[33:52] if people spent less time worried about
[33:54] what everybody else has gotten worried
[33:55] about themselves
[33:59] you got to know for yourself
[34:06] but you know we we can
[34:08] play church
[34:10] many people they they've got they've got
[34:12] their their religious walk down path
[34:15] they got all of their religious sayings
[34:18] and all of the all of the i heard
[34:20] brother homer say years ago you know he
[34:22] said i was baptized he said i do all the
[34:24] baptist lingo
[34:26] he said he said because you talk to
[34:28] somebody that's a baptist you know a
[34:29] baptist
[34:30] you know what you know because you know
[34:32] what kind of person they are you know
[34:34] all these different things
[34:36] and so you you go through all you know
[34:38] and you know just like just like the the
[34:40] uh
[34:41] the pharisees
[34:44] you know jesus out there talking to them
[34:47] and here they are the religious leaders
[34:49] of the day
[34:51] now if you want to talk about somebody
[34:52] that knew the word they knew the word
[34:56] they spent all their life knowing it and
[34:57] if you want to talk about something that
[34:59] was written they knew it
[35:01] they had all the lines memorized
[35:04] and every little thing that they were
[35:06] walking down the street everything that
[35:07] they were supposed to do
[35:10] here jesus out there talking about said
[35:11] y'all spend all your time tithing on
[35:13] every little minute little bit of spice
[35:16] or all these kind of things and he said
[35:17] you've missed the weight of your matters
[35:19] of the law
[35:21] he said he said here you here you are
[35:23] out arguing over these things and you
[35:25] know trying to trying to get people to
[35:26] look at you and not realize what what
[35:29] the actually the real part of the law
[35:31] was
[35:33] he said he said oh we we have abraham to
[35:36] our father
[35:38] here here we are where we know we note
[35:40] the law he said well if you knew abraham
[35:42] rejoiced to see my day
[35:44] [Music]
[35:45] abraham rejoice to see this day and hear
[35:47] you are out trying to kill me
[35:50] how do you actually rejoice
[35:53] he said he said you're not you're not
[35:55] abraham's not your father he said your
[35:57] father's the devil
[35:59] he said he said because he said he said
[36:01] the works that your your father does he
[36:03] said you'll do also
[36:06] he said he said your father's well here
[36:09] he said y'all out clean in the tombs and
[36:11] honoring all these dead prophets and he
[36:13] said your fathers are the ones that put
[36:15] them there
[36:16] well because they didn't agree with what
[36:18] the prophets had to say but when it came
[36:21] to pass then you turned around and went
[36:22] out there and out there polishing oh
[36:24] what a wonderful prophet he was
[36:28] and yet when when the truth came and it
[36:31] stood there and rebuked the people for
[36:32] what they believed and what they had
[36:34] done then you know what they were ready
[36:35] to kill them
[36:38] well here's here's jesus and in john 15
[36:40] 22
[36:42] jesus was speaking to the disciples and
[36:44] he said speaking of the pharisees he
[36:46] said if i had not come and spoken unto
[36:49] them they had not had sin
[36:52] but now they have no cloak for their sin
[36:57] so when when he began to speak see he
[36:59] began to point out the problems that
[37:01] they had
[37:03] of what what they because they walked in
[37:05] a way that they thought was self because
[37:07] it was self-righteous because they
[37:09] thought they had the law understood they
[37:11] thought they had the law memorized and
[37:12] everything worked out just fine
[37:15] until jesus come and started pointing
[37:17] these things out to the way they
[37:20] followed the word when he began to say
[37:23] this is because i am the fulfillment of
[37:25] the word
[37:27] here it searches the scripture
[37:29] and when he begins to speak to them all
[37:31] the ways that they
[37:33] had done
[37:36] and then when when he began to say these
[37:38] are these are the full this is the
[37:40] fulfillment of the word
[37:41] and he began to point them back
[37:45] and every time they pointed them back
[37:46] then they realized you know what they
[37:47] didn't have a place to stand
[37:51] he began to tear down their doctrines
[37:54] and then when he began to do that then
[37:56] they wanted to kill him
[37:59] but you know he that's but that's what
[38:00] he come to do
[38:02] he become because he was the fulfillment
[38:05] of the word so he came to make the the
[38:07] law manifest to make the word manifest
[38:10] and when he began to do that one because
[38:11] people didn't see that
[38:13] one because they didn't focus on what
[38:15] the scripture said
[38:17] they had their focus on what the law
[38:20] meant to them
[38:23] and brother speaking here he said you
[38:25] know it's us we got to focus on the word
[38:28] not on ourselves
[38:35] here's this is from the masterpiece
[38:40] brother brown says
[38:42] he said so we realize that we're here in
[38:44] a negative form
[38:46] and he says as long as there is a
[38:48] negative there has to be a positive
[38:50] there cannot be a negative without a
[38:52] positive see because
[38:53] because it's because of the positive
[38:56] that makes the negative
[38:58] like you had a negative picture of some
[39:00] object there has to be an object
[39:03] somewhere
[39:04] or to strike the light strike that lens
[39:07] or there wouldn't be any negative
[39:10] so when we see that our life here is in
[39:13] the negative and knowing that we're
[39:15] in the image of some life somewhere then
[39:18] we know that there is a positive
[39:20] somewhere that the light has struck and
[39:23] it's reflected something here on earth
[39:25] and he said and we are we are only that
[39:28] reflection the genuine object is some
[39:30] somewhere if that isn't he said i'm the
[39:33] worst deceived man in the world i've
[39:34] spent my life in vain but i know beyond
[39:37] the shadow of a doubt amen that is there
[39:39] see that's why we're here see
[39:43] so we see that he's speaking of this
[39:46] of the object in the lens
[39:51] and you know in physics
[39:53] they have a
[39:55] if you shine
[39:57] a light through a lens
[40:00] and it's called the principal focus
[40:04] and when that light goes through that
[40:05] that lens
[40:08] there is one place and that was the
[40:10] reason i read that uh definition because
[40:12] when it goes through that lens
[40:15] then all of the light is reflected into
[40:17] one spot
[40:19] so we see it it narrows down and it's
[40:21] called the principal focus
[40:24] and it doesn't matter where that light
[40:25] comes from when it shines through the
[40:27] light it points back to one spot
[40:30] and so you know then we're living here
[40:32] in the negative but there's a but our
[40:34] life here is pointing us back to
[40:36] something
[40:38] so what is it what is it that when we
[40:40] say the the light
[40:42] say all the light here that is shining
[40:44] is like in physics when it's shining
[40:45] through the lens so when it's shining
[40:47] through the lens of the word
[40:49] you know you know the the scripture
[40:51] tells us he said the the letter killeth
[40:54] but the spirit gives life
[40:57] so many times what we've we've read
[41:00] many things in the scripture
[41:04] we've read many things in the scripture
[41:07] how many times have you read things over
[41:09] and over and over
[41:11] and it doesn't mean anything to you
[41:14] but it takes one time
[41:16] why because it's not just it's not just
[41:19] reading the word but it takes the light
[41:22] on the word
[41:24] when the light strikes the word then you
[41:26] can see these things
[41:28] you but you walk in darkness
[41:32] you know as as paul said you know we see
[41:34] through a glass darkly
[41:36] you walk in in the light that you have
[41:39] but you begin to see these things but
[41:41] what is it every time you see that
[41:42] principle light if that light doesn't
[41:45] strike and you don't see jesus christ in
[41:47] that then you know what that light is
[41:49] not the the lens or something there's a
[41:51] problem somewhere
[41:52] because you know what if the holy ghost
[41:54] is shining the light on the word then
[41:56] it'll show you jesus christ every time
[41:59] you're not going to see something
[42:00] different it's going to show you the
[42:02] light
[42:04] and it's going to illuminate something
[42:06] well you know what it's not it's not
[42:08] going to shine it's not always shining
[42:09] so brightly that you see everything but
[42:11] you know there's a part that you have to
[42:13] see
[42:14] and that you hold on to
[42:17] and then you just keep walking
[42:19] and then the light becomes more
[42:23] you know here's here's the disciples
[42:27] walking with jesus and jesus begins to
[42:29] speak to him
[42:31] and he begins to speak to him and they
[42:33] didn't always understand what he was
[42:34] saying but he'd be but he what did he
[42:35] tell peter and then he said but you'll
[42:37] understand this later
[42:39] and he began to speak to
[42:41] but you hold on to that
[42:44] even after all the things that he was
[42:45] raised and they're out there and and i
[42:47] can't remember who it was but was
[42:49] reading the scripture in acts but you
[42:50] know there you see their word they're
[42:52] reading in
[42:53] uh acts 1 and they come to jesus and ask
[42:56] him are you going to raise up your
[42:57] kingdom at this time
[43:00] after all that he had done and preached
[43:02] to them
[43:03] and tried to explain these things to
[43:05] people
[43:06] and they still didn't understand him
[43:10] and you know and
[43:11] many times people people you know you
[43:14] hold on to what you have
[43:17] you know
[43:18] i won't i want to give a little bit of a
[43:20] testimony tonight and
[43:22] um
[43:26] brother white was talking about a
[43:27] brother that
[43:28] he's a preacher that
[43:30] was
[43:31] uh
[43:33] had some
[43:34] different ideas about some
[43:36] about the about
[43:38] about the statue of a perfect man
[43:40] and i can can i can i i want to give a a
[43:43] testimony tonight
[43:46] uh because
[43:47] if you've seen what that the the brother
[43:50] had wrote
[43:51] some of you probably haven't but i'll
[43:53] i'll just give you a brief explanation
[43:55] of it because you know i want to tell
[43:57] you i won't tell you not that's the way
[43:59] i saw it
[44:00] for a long time that's what i saw
[44:04] and let me tell you something you know
[44:06] why because you know you can only glean
[44:08] from a lot from the light that you get
[44:13] but i i want to
[44:18] i told somebody one time i was talking
[44:20] about
[44:20] what i understood about the message you
[44:22] know i you know because you see the
[44:24] condition that people are in
[44:27] because you know what when you walked in
[44:28] a mile in somebody's shoes you know what
[44:30] you know where people are coming from
[44:33] i told somebody one time i said you
[44:35] could take everything that i knew about
[44:37] this message double it put it on the top
[44:39] of a pen the head of a pen roll it
[44:41] around for a million years and they'd
[44:43] never touch each other
[44:46] that kind of that gives you an idea
[44:51] i do thank the lord
[44:53] but you know what it takes holding on
[44:57] you know everybody said brother dale
[44:59] always said he said don't go to lulu i
[45:00] said you'll get confused no you'll find
[45:02] out you're already confused well you
[45:04] know what i was confused
[45:07] i was confused as a day is long but you
[45:09] know what i held onto what i believed
[45:13] i knew what brother branham said but i
[45:14] didn't see it all but you know what i
[45:15] held on to it i knew what brother
[45:17] branham said
[45:19] i didn't see it
[45:24] you know
[45:26] only on the
[45:27] hearing the stage of a perfect man we
[45:28] know brother bram said
[45:29] here is is the new birth
[45:33] that's right
[45:37] i'm going to read this
[45:40] i just i just feel like
[45:42] i i just want to read this because if
[45:45] nobody's ever read it i want to read it
[45:46] tonight i know brother wade is quoted
[45:49] and but i just want to read this is from
[45:52] this is from 1962 brother rem says in
[45:54] the statute of pokemon he said notice
[45:55] you must be born again
[45:57] he said when you're born again you
[45:59] cannot
[46:00] you can't be born again without having
[46:02] faith
[46:03] this is number number nine brother
[46:04] anderson or whoever's in the back you
[46:06] want to pull it up he said that's right
[46:08] you see on my chart here i've got the
[46:10] very foundation faith is the foundation
[46:12] of it all for without faith it's
[46:14] impossible to please god he that cometh
[46:16] to god must believe that he is and a
[46:18] rewarder of those that diligently seek
[46:20] him see he must be
[46:22] and when you're a skeptic of the bible
[46:24] when you're a skeptic of the word being
[46:26] right
[46:27] he said you just might as well stay back
[46:30] until you first
[46:32] first you believe it
[46:33] he said what is sin unbelief he said
[46:35] there's only two elements that control
[46:37] the human being that's either doubt or
[46:39] faith one or the other you're possessed
[46:41] of one that dominates your life just
[46:44] depends on how much faith you have how
[46:46] high you can rise
[46:49] and then brother brandon continues on
[46:50] here
[46:52] this is from uh this is paragraph 138 he
[46:55] says
[46:56] he said and that's what we're supposed
[46:58] to do reflect the son of god
[47:00] now we're supposed to do his work he
[47:02] said he that believeth on me saint john
[47:04] 14 7 says he that believeth on me the
[47:07] works that i do shall he do also you're
[47:09] beginning to reflect the works of christ
[47:12] he said but so many of us try to do the
[47:14] works of christ before the reflection of
[47:16] christ is in us
[47:24] where'd they get to
[47:26] now there's the trouble we find those
[47:28] things happening you you know it i know
[47:30] it we see these stumbles along the road
[47:33] we find the scrap heaps of ministers of
[47:36] christians piled along the road it's
[47:37] because they didn't go in it right
[47:40] and that's why i'm here this morning to
[47:43] try to teach this little church and
[47:45] myself how that we can become the
[47:47] dwelling place of the living god how
[47:49] many like to be that amen
[47:52] he said the dwelling place of the living
[47:54] god
[47:55] he said now here is what we do what's
[47:57] the first thing have faith and be born
[47:59] again he said that's laying the
[48:01] foundation
[48:02] then after we lay the foundation
[48:04] secondly you add to your foundation add
[48:06] to your faith peter said here add to
[48:08] your faith first you have faith then you
[48:10] add virtue to your faith this is the
[48:12] next column next pour into foundation
[48:15] faith then your faith advert you now
[48:17] right there knocks a lot of us down yes
[48:20] sir advert you to your faith that
[48:21] doesn't just mean living a virgin life
[48:23] you know like the woman or man so forth
[48:26] that doesn't have anything to do with
[48:27] that
[48:29] but i just wanted to read that because
[48:31] we we quote that a lot of times but you
[48:32] know
[48:34] you can read things but until the light
[48:36] strikes it and it comes open to you it's
[48:39] dead letter you're walking around in
[48:42] darkness
[48:43] but you know what i thank god because it
[48:45] takes time
[48:47] because there's a day and an hour when
[48:49] the light strikes it and you catch the
[48:51] folk your focus point that point becomes
[48:54] open to you that you can reflect you see
[48:56] that and then you continue on
[48:59] brother branham talks about the man that
[49:01] he was walking and he pre he was
[49:03] preaching there in kentucky and the man
[49:04] was there and he didn't understand
[49:06] brother branham he didn't really agree
[49:07] with him or anything like that brother
[49:08] brandon was speaking to him and he said
[49:10] brother he said where do you live he
[49:12] said i live up over the mountain he said
[49:14] how are you going to get home he said
[49:15] well i'ma walk this path he said can you
[49:18] see your home from here he said all you
[49:19] can see is this path can you say no but
[49:21] i know where it's at he said how do you
[49:23] get there
[49:24] he said well i got this lantern
[49:27] he said well is the land can you see
[49:29] your house with from here with that
[49:31] lantern no he said but i can see the
[49:32] path
[49:34] he said because he said so what are we
[49:36] doing he said well i just walk in the
[49:37] light in the pathway that's there i just
[49:39] walked with the light he said brother
[49:41] that's the same way with a christian
[49:42] experience he said you don't see it all
[49:44] but he said but that light is shining
[49:46] and he said you walk in the path that
[49:47] lays down far in front of you and he
[49:49] said if we walk in the light as his in
[49:51] the light then we have fellowship one
[49:53] with another
[49:54] so then we have to walk in the light
[49:56] that's in front of us
[49:59] so if we walk in this then you know we
[50:01] see the things that we that we see and
[50:03] we wonder why we have the experience
[50:05] that we have why because it makes us
[50:07] into who we are
[50:09] because you've got to overcome the
[50:10] things that you've had to overcome and
[50:12] builds the character into you
[50:17] that's the reason you know we don't we
[50:18] we wish we had a flowery bed of ease we
[50:20] wish that we had all the answers but you
[50:22] know what that ain't the way it's going
[50:23] to happen
[50:27] sometimes life just felt like you're
[50:28] riding around in a well in the washing
[50:29] machine
[50:32] you don't even know which way you're
[50:33] going
[50:35] but you know the thing is is when things
[50:37] get old topsy-turvy you know what you
[50:39] just realize god's still in control
[50:42] god's still leading you so god is still
[50:44] moving
[50:46] why because if we have our focus on him
[50:48] that he's going to lead us all the way
[50:53] but you know
[50:54] and and so my my understanding was this
[50:59] if you want to know why people don't
[51:00] people don't preach the statue of a
[51:02] perfect man there's a lot of things
[51:03] people don't preach
[51:06] let me tell you i've heard i've heard a
[51:07] lot of sugar tit doctrines i've heard a
[51:10] lot of sugar tent preaching
[51:15] well it's true
[51:17] well you know because you know i told
[51:19] somebody the other day i was talking and
[51:21] i said you know
[51:22] can you imagine
[51:24] if somebody that you love or you or your
[51:26] your sweetheart or your wife or somebody
[51:28] you know when y'all were dating
[51:29] according you know somebody write you
[51:30] know she writes you a letter and it's
[51:32] this long page
[51:34] of all of these words but you know
[51:36] somebody only gives you four words out
[51:39] of that letter and give it to you then
[51:40] you try to understand what she was
[51:42] writing to you
[51:44] here's here you get four words and she
[51:46] wrote this long letter the the
[51:48] brown now tell me what she said
[51:56] tell me
[51:56] but that's the way it is if you don't if
[51:58] you only get just a piece here and a
[52:00] piece there how are you supposed to know
[52:01] the mind of god
[52:04] if you're just getting little divots
[52:06] here and a little crumb here and a
[52:07] little crumb there how you spell you
[52:09] know if you had this great great queen's
[52:11] feast that was spread before you and
[52:13] they gave you four little crumbs what do
[52:14] you think of that
[52:16] well that's a taste ain't it
[52:19] what's the same way people people just
[52:21] you know you you just get a little a
[52:23] little snip here and a little snip there
[52:25] how are you supposed to understand
[52:29] people walk around in
[52:30] darkness there you know because there's
[52:33] such confusion
[52:36] but see that's the reason that brother
[52:38] rahm said it was so necessary
[52:40] it is so needful for teaching you've got
[52:43] to be positionally placed
[52:47] and so when you when you catch a little
[52:48] snippet here and a little snippet there
[52:50] you know you just try to put it together
[52:54] and no wonder people end up with a
[52:55] cowling tree
[52:57] eating grass why because you you you
[53:00] gather what you can
[53:03] but you know
[53:04] going going back to the chart here you
[53:05] know this is what i understood now
[53:08] and but but i want to show you if you
[53:11] your focus
[53:13] now if you can i want you to understand
[53:14] look at focus
[53:16] not not focused but i don't want you to
[53:18] think of the word focus but you know
[53:20] when
[53:21] you know i always understood this
[53:23] now this is this way i was this way i
[53:25] was i was from one
[53:27] from having not heard anybody really
[53:29] preach on this you're just catching
[53:30] snippets here and there trying to put
[53:32] things together so this is what i put
[53:33] together
[53:35] and you know and honestly you read the
[53:37] message
[53:38] and until the lord comes and touches you
[53:41] and it opens it to your eyes you're
[53:43] blind
[53:46] this was justification
[53:50] you're justified at faith this is
[53:52] sanctification
[53:53] here's the baptism holy ghost no that's
[53:55] what the brother had in the chart
[53:58] now the only thing that was different
[53:59] that from what i believed than what he
[54:02] wrote in that in his in his
[54:04] video
[54:05] is that he put the holy spirit
[54:07] all of this together
[54:10] now i want to show you something what
[54:12] the lord puts things he shows you things
[54:14] and he puts things you have questions
[54:16] you wonder why you get questions in your
[54:18] life it's because god will makes you sit
[54:20] on it and stew and simmer on it for a
[54:23] while
[54:24] chew on it a while that's right
[54:27] but here's here's faith
[54:29] and then here's so this is justification
[54:32] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[54:34] ghost
[54:35] so when you come to the holy ghost well
[54:37] then i always believe there's one thing
[54:39] is there there was a growth development
[54:42] well that was the capstone you had to
[54:44] grow
[54:46] because there was more that had to be
[54:47] done because you know
[54:49] brother ramsay said you know as newborn
[54:51] babes the bible says as newborn babes
[54:52] desire the sincere milk of the word
[54:55] so you know what you come up as a child
[54:57] you're a baby
[54:59] but you got to grow well you know what
[55:02] so here's here's here's the message
[55:04] this is the end time message it's the
[55:06] capstone that's what brother adam's
[55:08] message is the capstone
[55:10] but you know
[55:12] so i was i i looked at that and and so
[55:14] well there's there's justification
[55:15] sanctification the baptism the holy
[55:17] ghost there's the end time message but
[55:20] you know i got to reading one day and i
[55:22] got to thinking about something and and
[55:24] now something that struck me and i never
[55:26] could put it together
[55:29] because i just saw i was telling brother
[55:31] dawn the other day i said i could see
[55:32] there was a difference between the
[55:34] apostles and the 120 in the upper room
[55:36] and the 3000 outside
[55:39] and i was like now put that in that
[55:40] chart
[55:42] the way that i saw it
[55:44] the apostles didn't have the end time
[55:47] message
[55:49] so then
[55:50] if that's the way it goes then you're
[55:52] putting all of us at the headstone here
[55:55] at the top
[55:56] and i was like well that don't make any
[55:57] sense now how does this work
[56:00] but i've seen justification i could see
[56:02] sanctification
[56:04] but i could
[56:05] but see your focus is out
[56:09] and one day i was talking to pop
[56:11] by the day i was talking and you know
[56:13] all of a sudden it just started
[56:18] all of a sudden the clear i was like oh
[56:20] i saw that when he said
[56:22] when he started because he was one
[56:23] quoting what brother branham said
[56:26] like you know wow
[56:28] let's just
[56:28] listen to what the prophet has to say
[56:31] you know what amazing if we just
[56:33] pull out the plugs out of our ears
[56:35] but all of a sudden here you see this is
[56:37] this is your born-again experience here
[56:41] then all of a sudden i could see then
[56:43] then i knew what what struck me was i
[56:46] could see that because what the clarity
[56:48] was
[56:48] here's where the apostles were
[56:52] here's the 3000 outside
[56:56] so when you see here and then you see
[56:58] here's the capstone
[57:01] see here's here's jesus christ and when
[57:04] brother branham come to preach the
[57:05] message he had to bring the capstone
[57:08] the end time revelation
[57:10] so then you saw oh well here's here's
[57:12] where they were at
[57:14] but here we are
[57:16] then you understand yeah
[57:18] this is sanctification
[57:20] you've got you've got justification
[57:22] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[57:23] ghost here
[57:25] that is the new birth you do but this is
[57:27] sanctification also
[57:29] this is a daily sanctification
[57:33] that paul told you're still going up the
[57:35] statue of a perfect man because you're
[57:36] sanctified as these virtues are being
[57:39] added in
[57:41] well then when when somebody said well
[57:43] this is sanctification but it's the
[57:45] second stage when you begin to well you
[57:47] know what that makes absolute sense but
[57:49] you know what mike but you know i didn't
[57:51] it was like well i didn't i don't see
[57:52] that no but i saw a part of that right
[57:55] but you know it takes a little bit of
[57:57] understanding
[57:59] why why is it so important to have god
[58:03] god called me in
[58:05] that preach the word
[58:07] to open your because you know what you
[58:08] can walk around and if you think if you
[58:10] think you're gonna get it all by
[58:12] yourself and you're a one-man show you
[58:13] can pull yourself up by your bootstraps
[58:15] let me tell you what you're totally
[58:17] absolutely wrong you're not ever going
[58:19] to get it by yourself because god called
[58:22] a fivefold ministry to preach
[58:25] and you know not every man and you know
[58:27] i'll there's a there's a i thank god i
[58:29] had some wonderful men that that have
[58:31] helped me over the over the years but
[58:33] you know not every man who stands behind
[58:34] the pulpits called to be behind the
[58:36] pulpit
[58:38] and you know and not every not every man
[58:40] that's behind the pulpit has the same
[58:42] level
[58:45] but you know you've got but you've got
[58:47] to hold on to what god shows you
[58:50] and then all of a sudden when i began to
[58:52] see that you know amen it makes it makes
[58:54] perfect sense
[58:56] and i you know because you see that you
[58:58] know i always love the statue of a
[58:59] perfect man because you know that you
[59:01] see that's jesus christ that's that's
[59:04] the manifestation that's the stature of
[59:06] jesus christ in a human
[59:09] in a christian a believer that's the
[59:11] most god being molded into a person
[59:15] but you know what it takes it takes a
[59:16] revelation it takes god bringing you
[59:19] there
[59:20] and how are you and if you if you don't
[59:22] have have understanding if you don't
[59:24] have a preacher
[59:26] if you don't have somebody that can lead
[59:27] you up there you know that's the reason
[59:29] that
[59:30] you know
[59:31] peter was out there preaching
[59:33] he said you know he said because if you
[59:35] like these things
[59:37] but he said but he said if you
[59:39] understand that you have these things he
[59:41] said you're not going to be unfruitful
[59:44] but you've got to understand these
[59:46] things
[59:48] and praise god that that he has opened
[59:50] these things up that we've been able to
[59:51] see them because you know i tell you
[59:53] what
[59:54] i i look back on my life sometimes and
[59:56] and think of all the things that that
[59:58] i've heard
[1:00:00] you know i heard the first time i ever
[1:00:02] heard anybody preach that jesus wasn't
[1:00:04] god until the river jordan yeah
[1:00:07] i remember i remember that it stuck in
[1:00:09] my crawl
[1:00:11] it was something you just i did i i told
[1:00:14] the lord i was sitting there the man was
[1:00:15] preaching it and i sat there in the
[1:00:17] church and i told the lord i was praying
[1:00:19] and say if that's truth you'll have to
[1:00:20] reveal that to me because they don't
[1:00:22] make any sense to me
[1:00:24] i said because you know even even when
[1:00:26] when i'd even one little bit of
[1:00:29] understanding that i have
[1:00:31] i said that still don't make any sense
[1:00:33] to me
[1:00:35] and i know i don't know i don't know i
[1:00:36] know i don't know a lot
[1:00:38] but i know that don't make any
[1:00:41] but you know there's people they just
[1:00:43] swallow that up hook line and secret
[1:00:44] jump up and praise the lord and scream
[1:00:46] and shout and everything like that it's
[1:00:47] like how is that
[1:00:51] you know
[1:00:54] it blows me it blows my mind and you
[1:00:56] know because you got people and people
[1:00:58] don't realize this but they got people
[1:01:00] out there and they're saying well i'm
[1:01:01] eternal i come in here with this eternal
[1:01:03] seed from god from the foundation of the
[1:01:05] world that was painted inside of me and
[1:01:07] you know what they got jesus coming just
[1:01:09] as a man
[1:01:11] and here they are saying i come from the
[1:01:13] mind of god and i'm eternal and he's
[1:01:16] just a man he just come as flesh and
[1:01:19] he's the one that fulfilled the word
[1:01:20] that was prophesied in the beginning in
[1:01:22] genesis when when the fall happened and
[1:01:25] again god come in the garden and talk to
[1:01:27] adam and eve and told them
[1:01:29] he's the one that was prophesied to come
[1:01:35] you know and so let me
[1:01:38] i'm gonna preach tonight because i'm
[1:01:40] here so i'm gonna preach
[1:01:43] but you know tell me who tell me who is
[1:01:46] the one that tries to exalt himself
[1:01:48] above god
[1:01:52] so tell me where does that where does
[1:01:53] that doctrine come from
[1:01:55] i got it on tape now it doesn't set it
[1:02:01] well they don't listen but you know
[1:02:03] that'll make the news
[1:02:05] from somebody
[1:02:06] but you know what that comes i'll tell
[1:02:08] you i tell you like somebody said one
[1:02:09] time he said that comes straight out of
[1:02:11] the pits of hell
[1:02:15] whether you agree with that or not
[1:02:16] that's the truth
[1:02:21] i just it just
[1:02:23] why because you know i come in sin shape
[1:02:25] and iniquity i come i come born speaking
[1:02:28] lies i come it's totally alienated from
[1:02:31] the from the life and the mercy of god
[1:02:34] but you know what when god when jesus
[1:02:36] came you know he said he said he came
[1:02:38] through his his theophany he said well
[1:02:40] we bypassed our theophany
[1:02:43] well then how in the world did he come
[1:02:44] just as a man
[1:02:47] and then had to receive something but
[1:02:49] you come here eternal life
[1:02:54] how how does and then tell me and tell
[1:02:56] me this is the great revelation of the
[1:02:58] end time
[1:03:01] i just i just i
[1:03:03] there's only one that tries to exalt
[1:03:04] himself above god
[1:03:09] but you know what i saw
[1:03:12] christ
[1:03:15] because he was
[1:03:16] was the great eternal that came down
[1:03:20] and came in flesh
[1:03:22] he condescended and then he began to
[1:03:25] speak and so he was the one that spoke
[1:03:27] everything into existence
[1:03:29] and then he continued on and spoke
[1:03:31] through the words of the prophets the
[1:03:34] prophets built the body so they laid out
[1:03:36] the whole entire plan and then he
[1:03:38] stepped down in the middle of everything
[1:03:40] that had been saith and he began to
[1:03:42] manifest exactly what had been preached
[1:03:44] exactly what had been prophesied
[1:03:47] all of those prophecies that were given
[1:03:49] in the old testament all of those that
[1:03:51] were laid out before isaiah
[1:03:54] 800 years before before
[1:03:59] jesus come into in the end of the world
[1:04:02] and here's here's isaiah talking about a
[1:04:04] virgin shall conceive
[1:04:06] all of the promises that he gave cogan
[1:04:09] about how he would come
[1:04:12] greater and what peter said or paul said
[1:04:14] the great is the mystery of godliness
[1:04:17] god was manifested in the flesh
[1:04:19] he's been made flesh so you know he
[1:04:21] didn't have to he didn't have to he
[1:04:22] become
[1:04:23] in the flesh and was born of a virgin
[1:04:28] then you know when he came but when he
[1:04:30] came he became the lower into the lowest
[1:04:32] form
[1:04:34] he came from the highest to the lowest
[1:04:37] to be born in a stable
[1:04:42] over a manure pile
[1:04:46] it's amazing and people well glory to
[1:04:48] god you know what it is
[1:04:50] people don't realize what that what they
[1:04:52] what they say
[1:04:54] oh praise god we have this great
[1:04:57] great revelation of the godhead
[1:05:01] i'm sorry you're more confusing
[1:05:04] but it's sad
[1:05:07] but to know what god done for us
[1:05:11] but you know it's it's for a that god
[1:05:14] and you hold on to what you have and god
[1:05:17] comes along and all of a sudden he
[1:05:18] begins to show you these things
[1:05:22] it's a wonderful thing one because you
[1:05:23] know i i
[1:05:25] i understand
[1:05:27] ephesians 2 says said
[1:05:30] that we were born
[1:05:32] the children of wrath even as
[1:05:34] others
[1:05:36] but god rich in mercy
[1:05:40] i i thank god that he had mercy on me
[1:05:46] the god that god would would come to to
[1:05:49] a slave that he would come to to one
[1:05:51] that was so low
[1:05:56] and when you realize what god has done
[1:05:58] for you
[1:06:01] you know because
[1:06:06] you know i realize what kind of person i
[1:06:09] am
[1:06:11] but you know if you never come to that
[1:06:13] place to realize who you are
[1:06:16] you know god's never going never going
[1:06:17] to help you
[1:06:18] god can't ever do any work for you
[1:06:21] but you know you realize you know i'm
[1:06:23] i'm i'm worse than anybody
[1:06:27] i'm i'm a low as i is any anybody
[1:06:32] you know there in me there's not one
[1:06:34] good thing
[1:06:37] and if
[1:06:38] so when you realize you know i don't
[1:06:39] have i don't have anything
[1:06:42] but you know it was all him
[1:06:45] it was him that came to me
[1:06:49] it was him that that
[1:06:51] saw me
[1:06:54] jesus said i didn't you didn't choose me
[1:06:56] he said i chose you
[1:07:01] it ordained you
[1:07:04] we were chosen in him before the
[1:07:05] foundation of the world
[1:07:09] that god saw us amen and would reach out
[1:07:12] to us
[1:07:14] what a wonderful thing
[1:07:17] when you realize you know when you
[1:07:18] realize where you come from that you you
[1:07:20] know you
[1:07:22] no one no wonder brother i said my whole
[1:07:23] my whole outlook is grace why because
[1:07:26] that's all it is is grace that's the
[1:07:28] only way that's because the song says he
[1:07:30] said grace has brought me this far and
[1:07:33] grace is going to lead me home because
[1:07:35] it's the only thing that carries me
[1:07:37] because you know as long as i i can look
[1:07:39] to god's grace and realize you know
[1:07:40] because
[1:07:41] everything that i do
[1:07:44] is accepting his grace
[1:07:47] his provision he's made the way and so
[1:07:50] when you see that when you when you
[1:07:51] receive this new birth
[1:07:53] when you're when you're born into this
[1:07:55] kingdom when you realize what god's done
[1:07:57] for you and brought you and he's made
[1:07:59] you more than a conqueror
[1:08:00] and he's brought you to this place then
[1:08:02] you know what then you have have been
[1:08:04] called to in this hour god has called
[1:08:07] you to a body change and you know it's
[1:08:10] the same one it's the same one that
[1:08:12] called you
[1:08:15] and so what is it he's called you to one
[1:08:17] place and you know what he's going to
[1:08:18] continue those that he has justified
[1:08:20] he's also glorified and if he's called
[1:08:23] you to one then guess what he's calling
[1:08:24] you up
[1:08:25] he's calling you up higher he's calling
[1:08:27] you up higher than in a higher place
[1:08:29] than you've reached
[1:08:31] well you know what you say well thank
[1:08:32] god i have rece i've reached faith well
[1:08:34] then guess what god's calling you to add
[1:08:36] virtue he's because you know what that
[1:08:39] he's obligated to bring you to the place
[1:08:41] to show you how to come to that
[1:08:44] then you know what if you know if you
[1:08:46] want to know where you are
[1:08:59] and so
[1:09:00] but you know um
[1:09:03] you know
[1:09:04] people that's so it's so important to
[1:09:07] understand these things
[1:09:10] well because so many people have come
[1:09:12] and you know they they get in they get
[1:09:14] in this place where you know
[1:09:16] just like brother i'm talking about the
[1:09:17] the pentecostals you know they get to
[1:09:19] this place where you know praise god i
[1:09:20] got the i got the new birth i'm born
[1:09:22] again i've been to kingdom and you know
[1:09:23] that was the end of it he said no you're
[1:09:25] just getting started
[1:09:27] here you are you're just getting started
[1:09:29] just by the new birth breaks you brings
[1:09:31] you into a place as a newborn baby puts
[1:09:33] you in the body but there's a place of
[1:09:34] growth that has to you've got to grow up
[1:09:36] into the stature of a perfect man you've
[1:09:39] got to grow you know
[1:09:43] you know i was thinking you know
[1:09:44] when i was born
[1:09:47] i i was i was uh
[1:09:49] seven pounds 14 ounces 20 and a half
[1:09:51] inches long
[1:09:54] and i wasn't the biggest janine was
[1:09:56] janine was the biggest she's eight
[1:09:57] pounds 11 ounces
[1:10:00] but you know what i made up for it after
[1:10:02] i got here
[1:10:05] mama tell you mama's watching in she'll
[1:10:07] tell you i made up for it
[1:10:09] i lapped the rest of them
[1:10:11] i did
[1:10:13] i was three months old and i outweighed
[1:10:15] some of it three months old that some of
[1:10:17] them didn't make six seven eight months
[1:10:18] old
[1:10:20] i was chunky
[1:10:23] i figured out one thing that when i got
[1:10:24] here i figured out one thing i could do
[1:10:26] and that was eat
[1:10:28] i could eat and i could eat with the
[1:10:29] best of them
[1:10:31] but you know when i was born
[1:10:34] when i come in this world do you know
[1:10:36] what i had calcium in my body
[1:10:39] i had iron phosphorus
[1:10:42] sodium all these other elements they
[1:10:45] were all in me
[1:10:46] everything everything that's in a human
[1:10:48] was in me i had it
[1:10:50] everything that i had everything that i
[1:10:51] had need for this earthly journey was
[1:10:52] given to me in the new birth
[1:10:55] i had it
[1:10:56] all but you know what let me tell you
[1:10:59] what when i come in here it's 7 pounds
[1:11:01] 14 ounces
[1:11:03] i didn't have all the calcium
[1:11:06] but you know what i found i found i
[1:11:07] found how to get to it
[1:11:11] and every other thing
[1:11:13] and you know what i began to eat on that
[1:11:15] amen
[1:11:16] and i began to grow and you know what i
[1:11:18] still got that
[1:11:20] i still love to eat
[1:11:22] but you know what i began to i began to
[1:11:24] draw nourishment
[1:11:26] and brother ram said he said he said all
[1:11:28] you've got to do is drink and push out
[1:11:32] he said so in the new birth you have all
[1:11:34] that you have need of
[1:11:36] is given to you
[1:11:37] but it's not made manifest so when you
[1:11:40] when you have all that you have need of
[1:11:42] is given to you yeah you've got a
[1:11:44] portion of this but you're right here
[1:11:47] but you know what you've got access to
[1:11:49] that
[1:11:50] why because he's drawing you up
[1:11:54] so he's calling you up drawing you
[1:11:58] so you know you when you when you have a
[1:12:00] baby you know you just don't you just
[1:12:02] bring them home and set them in the
[1:12:03] closet or set them on the bed leave them
[1:12:05] in the crib
[1:12:07] no what do you do every so often you got
[1:12:09] to keep putting that bottle in their
[1:12:10] mouth
[1:12:13] and you know everyone every every
[1:12:15] child's different they all get but you
[1:12:17] know what they all go through the same
[1:12:18] things
[1:12:21] but you but you know
[1:12:24] we had we had levi
[1:12:26] now levi
[1:12:28] he
[1:12:29] is a professional sleeper
[1:12:33] that
[1:12:35] and
[1:12:37] that's one reason we call him lazarus
[1:12:43] levi
[1:12:44] three weeks old he slept seven hours
[1:12:48] straight a night three weeks old
[1:12:51] boy could sleep
[1:12:53] we brought him home he was only a week
[1:12:55] or two old i'm not exactly sure he slept
[1:12:57] for 12
[1:12:58] hours straight
[1:13:02] boy is not out we called the
[1:13:04] pediatrician and the and the nurse says
[1:13:07] well as long as he's breathing
[1:13:10] she said if he gets like 14 hours wake
[1:13:12] him up
[1:13:14] well he slept and slept and slept and
[1:13:16] slept yeah
[1:13:19] but he slept and slept and slept and
[1:13:21] then all of a sudden when he woke up he
[1:13:22] was ready to eat
[1:13:24] and i don't think sarah feed him fast
[1:13:25] enough he was he was starving
[1:13:29] but you know adam adam wasn't happy
[1:13:31] about nothing
[1:13:32] he come in the world and i think levi
[1:13:35] loved that he had a brother and after a
[1:13:36] while i think he's ready to give him
[1:13:37] back or sell him or something
[1:13:43] he uh
[1:13:44] he was not happy he was
[1:13:47] he had
[1:13:48] he had colic and he was he was not happy
[1:13:50] about nothing
[1:13:52] nothing nothing made him happy for a
[1:13:53] while and finally when he decided that
[1:13:56] he was going to live
[1:13:57] and he was going to live with the rest
[1:13:58] of us and he was going to let the rest
[1:14:00] of us live
[1:14:02] sarah was like i get some sleep now she
[1:14:04] was ready
[1:14:05] she was so happy that she could finally
[1:14:07] get some sleep
[1:14:09] like they always say if you're
[1:14:12] if you're
[1:14:13] if your second child was your first one
[1:14:14] you wouldn't have a second child
[1:14:18] and that's the way that's why adam was
[1:14:19] bless his heart he he wore his mama out
[1:14:23] but you know every child is different
[1:14:25] but you know what every one of them has
[1:14:27] the same needs

[1:16:53] i said y'all need to look to god
[1:16:57] and i said if you hit hard times i said
[1:16:59] you need to find somebody even if you do
[1:17:00] go talk to your priest i said you need
[1:17:02] to talk to somebody
[1:17:04] but y'all need to come together and come
[1:17:06] up with a plan
[1:17:07] and have an understanding before you get
[1:17:09] married
[1:17:10] about what i said about finances and all
[1:17:12] these other things you need to have an
[1:17:13] understanding before you start this
[1:17:17] you know
[1:17:18] they they were
[1:17:20] they were happily married for a number
[1:17:22] of years
[1:17:23] but uh
[1:17:24] you know his his wife was killed
[1:17:27] by a drunk driver
[1:17:28] a few years ago
[1:17:30] and you know he's he's still devastated
[1:17:32] by that but you know what he had the
[1:17:34] best
[1:17:36] time
[1:17:37] because you know that was his sweetheart
[1:17:38] and he still
[1:17:40] he's still tied to her
[1:17:43] and i said you know because he talks you
[1:17:44] know what a life that he had and i said
[1:17:46] see that's what makes it
[1:17:48] it's when you put her first and she puts
[1:17:51] you first
[1:17:53] when you come together and you put god
[1:17:55] first
[1:17:57] then you can then you put each other
[1:18:00] if if it doesn't if you're not doing
[1:18:01] that it's not going to work
[1:18:04] and and every in every situation
[1:18:07] when you and your and your with your
[1:18:09] children
[1:18:11] everything god has to be first
[1:18:15] if we don't if we don't raise our
[1:18:16] children in the in the admonition of god
[1:18:19] and the fear and admonition of god you
[1:18:20] know what
[1:18:22] we're doing it wrong
[1:18:24] you're not it's not and you know whether
[1:18:26] whether your kids go out in the world

[1:18:40] our church that have just walked out and
[1:18:41] they've left and they go out in the
[1:18:43] world and do whatever let me tell you
[1:18:44] what i i still
[1:18:47] yeah
[1:18:48] i was i was here it's been i told
[1:18:50] brother bob it's been several months ago
[1:18:52] and i was here and i was and i was
[1:18:54] preaching and
[1:18:55] i said you know what you the children i
[1:18:57] want y'all young people you don't go out
[1:18:59] in the world and live like however you
[1:19:00] want to but i'll tell you what this
[1:19:02] church has god has applied the token
[1:19:05] these we
[1:19:06] we claim our children
[1:19:09] you know you may not you may not you may
[1:19:11] not be my children but i still claim you
[1:19:13] i'm still going to hold faith i'm still
[1:19:15] going to believe for you
[1:19:20] and you know know and you know let me
[1:19:21] tell you i've seen and the ministers in
[1:19:24] this church so testify we've seen the
[1:19:26] look on people's faces you know because
[1:19:28] you know what it doesn't take
[1:19:29] discernment but doesn't tell you don't
[1:19:30] take discernment to see people
[1:19:34] but you know what we've seen kids that
[1:19:35] come in here
[1:19:37] and the world gets a hold of them and
[1:19:39] you know what they're ready to leave and
[1:19:40] they're ready to get out in the world
[1:19:42] and just do whatever well guess what
[1:19:45] go ahead prodigal go ahead do whatever
[1:19:48] but you know we're still we're still
[1:19:49] going to hold and still believe for you
[1:19:53] i still think about brother tom tell him
[1:19:55] telling wade
[1:19:57] we can't go till you get in
[1:20:01] why because there's a place for you
[1:20:03] but i've seen so many that that have
[1:20:05] walked out and you you see the look on
[1:20:07] these people's faces
[1:20:11] when you see the look you know because
[1:20:13] the world if if you don't get to christ
[1:20:16] the world's going to pull you
[1:20:19] brother brown said if you don't get them
[1:20:21] to christ he said rock and roll is going
[1:20:23] to get them
[1:20:25] now rock and roll and that includes rap
[1:20:28] and everything else
[1:20:31] and you think and they got people out
[1:20:32] there they listen to country and and and
[1:20:35] all of this christian stuff brother ryan
[1:20:37] can tell you testify all about all that
[1:20:39] christian stuff there ain't sometimes
[1:20:40] that stuff they might have christian in
[1:20:42] the name but that's as far as it goes as
[1:20:44] far as having anything to do with christ
[1:20:51] but you know i still i still believe
[1:20:55] and it doesn't matter as long as they're
[1:20:56] drawing as long as they're drawing
[1:20:58] breath and and that that includes not
[1:21:01] just the young people i'm talking about
[1:21:02] other people that's been in this church
[1:21:05] you know because if if
[1:21:08] abraham
