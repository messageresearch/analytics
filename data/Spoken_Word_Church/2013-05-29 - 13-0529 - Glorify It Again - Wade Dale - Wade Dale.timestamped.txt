[3:11] uh it is a it is a burden on my heart
[3:14] about brother Bill uh we just returned
[3:17] back from New Jersey a couple of weeks
[3:19] ago and he seemed to be in very good
[3:21] health so you never know right his
[3:24] coughing had been a lot better and he
[3:26] was trying to eat right and do do the
[3:28] right thing and and then here is uh here
[3:31] he's laying in the hospital with a with
[3:34] a stroke so I think he's uh 67 years old
[3:37] so just keep him in your prayers I I'm
[3:40] praying that uh it just impressed on my
[3:42] heart to go see him so maybe dad and I
[3:44] or myself for sure to going Friday to go
[3:47] see him so u i ride up and doesn't
[3:50] matter if I get to see him or not I want
[3:51] to make my I I want to you know he he's
[3:54] a buddy he's a good friend of mine you
[3:56] know so I I just want to uh to show him
[3:58] our support you know it's it gets lonely
[4:00] in the hospital when there's nobody
[4:02] there Danny had a pretty good support
[4:04] group with him but there was probably
[4:05] times when he was a little bit lonely
[4:07] and there's probably times when he
[4:08] wanted us all to leave but but that's so
[4:11] especially
[4:14] Joy but uh we all need support we're
[4:17] still human we all have human thoughts
[4:19] and ideas and you get to sit in the
[4:20] hospital like that and you get to think
[4:22] a lot cuz you don't get to do anything
[4:23] else
[4:25] so just please remember him in your
[4:27] prayer he it's just been a burden on my
[4:28] heart all day so he's he's not only a
[4:31] good friend he's a brother in the Lord
[4:33] so and known brother Bill for a long
[4:35] time and U know him to be a real true
[4:37] Christian man and I was just thinking
[4:39] today all the all the many great man of
[4:42] Faith all the great all the ones that
[4:44] he's prayed for that have been healed
[4:47] and the things that he's ministered to
[4:49] people I said Lord just take that and
[4:52] Heap it right back on him amen take all
[4:54] that take all that faith and all that
[4:56] word and all that all that U uh laying
[5:00] on of hands and the healing of the sick
[5:01] that's been in his ministry just Heap it
[5:03] back on him and and give him that power
[5:06] to uh to raise up out of that thing and
[5:08] we believe we got a god that'll do it
[5:10] doesn't matter what the doctor says the
[5:11] doctor can just tell you what's on a
[5:12] piece of paper but God doesn't work on
[5:15] pieces of paper he works on faith and
[5:18] faith is the substance of things HED for
[5:20] the evidence of Things Not Seen so let's
[5:22] bow our heads before we get started and
[5:25] uh talk to the author dear heavenly
[5:28] father we pray Lord
[5:30] you would come Among Us now
[5:32] and just be with us in a special way
[5:34] tonight father just break the words of
[5:36] eternal life to each one of us just Lord
[5:39] may we have faith for our journey and
[5:42] Lord as we have faith for our journey
[5:43] may we have a little left over to go to
[5:46] brother Bill and to go there in the
[5:48] hospital room where he is and Lord just
[5:51] a a good friend and a good buddy and and
[5:54] a and a gallant Soldier been preaching
[5:57] and ministering for for 40 30 something
[6:00] years and just bless him
[6:02] Lord just raise him up for your honor
[6:04] and Glory we know that the doctor looks
[6:07] at things one way and Lord you look at
[6:10] them totally different because your
[6:12] Healing Hand by one touch would be more
[6:16] than a thousand doctors could ever do
[6:19] and we pray now that the great physician
[6:21] will go to our brother and just heal him
[6:23] and raise him up for your honor and
[6:25] glory Lord and we expect to see a
[6:26] miracle yes Lord we expect to see you
[6:28] move on the scene and help our brother
[6:30] Lord there's a time there that he's he's
[6:33] not able to speak and he's not able to
[6:35] be conscious but Lord we know that his
[6:37] conscience is working we know that he's
[6:40] somewhere in that body and he's thinking
[6:43] about things and Lord just may you
[6:45] impress on him that the saints of God
[6:47] are praying for him that all around the
[6:50] country that men and women of Faith are
[6:52] are are sending out prayers for our
[6:55] brother and Lord I pray that you'd be
[6:57] with us here Lord just teach us
[6:59] something tonight father just let us
[7:01] always be in your will Lord bless the
[7:03] foreign missions Lord be with them give
[7:05] them fruit for their labor Lord take
[7:07] care of each one tonight we pray that
[7:09] you would just bless the ones that are
[7:11] not here the ones that are sick Lord not
[7:13] among us Lord that are sinick that that
[7:17] are dilatory Lord that that backslid or
[7:19] whatever what Lord I pray that you would
[7:21] just speak to their heart Lord you're
[7:23] still a God that comes on the scene and
[7:25] heals but you're also a God that will
[7:27] heal the soul you're God that'll heal
[7:30] that soul and make it whole father we
[7:33] pray that you do that tonight Lord we
[7:35] ask you to bless all the rest of the
[7:37] service now Lord we lay it in your hands
[7:39] use us Lord as your for your honor and
[7:41] glory and no one else for in Jesus name
[7:44] we ask these things
[7:47] amen want to um kind of give you a
[7:50] little thought tonight that uh we've
[7:52] been talking in the Sunday school class
[7:54] and it kind of impressed on me the other
[7:56] day we were heading down through the
[7:58] statue of a person perfect man and get
[8:00] into faith and and all that and and
[8:03] sometimes as a minister you'll know uh
[8:07] the Lord will go you need to be in
[8:10] Reverse you need to back up you miss
[8:13] something so we backed up a little bit
[8:16] and and we missed a point and I want us
[8:19] to see this point and I want us to
[8:21] really really listen tonight cuz it's
[8:24] going to it's not going to be I only got
[8:26] about three pages of notes so most of
[8:29] them scripture so we're going to be in
[8:30] the Bible so hang on to your Bible or or
[8:33] watch the screen so let's go with John
[8:35] 12:28 we're going to title this glorify
[8:38] it
[8:39] again John 12:28 says father glorify thy
[8:43] name now there's only one name for the
[8:45] father right that's who Lord Jesus
[8:47] Christ all right father glorify thy name
[8:50] then came there a voice from Heaven
[8:52] saying I have both glorified
[8:55] it and will glorify it again again right
[9:00] what's that it Thy Name all right and
[9:04] where's his name in the end times in his
[9:06] bride amen all right so we we got to
[9:08] come to that point and then verse 29 the
[9:10] people therefore that stood by and heard
[9:12] it said it thundered others said an
[9:14] angel spoke to him but look at the
[9:15] bottom one Jesus answers and said this
[9:17] voice didn't come because of me right it
[9:20] become it came because of you and it
[9:23] wasn't just for your sake of the people
[9:25] that was sitting there 2,000 years ago
[9:27] it's for our sake today all right so you
[9:29] may be seated and the Lord add his
[9:30] Blessing to the reading of his word but
[9:33] we look and see that we've been speaking
[9:36] on the Statue of a perfect man and and
[9:39] we kind of like I said we kind of feel
[9:40] felt a little check to back up a little
[9:42] bit and to take a look I'm going to put
[9:45] a prayer cloth in my pocket and we're
[9:47] going to pray over it and Lord willing
[9:49] if we get to take this to brother Bill
[9:51] we'll lay it on him cuz I'm sure he
[9:54] absolutely absolutely believes in prayer
[9:57] and prayer cloth so we're going to take
[9:59] this and and we've seen what it'll do
[10:02] right all right so Jesus answered said
[10:04] this voice came not because of
[10:06] me but for your sake all right now let's
[10:10] go to John
[10:14] 13:31 and let's read there John 13:31
[10:17] and 32 therefore when he was gone out
[10:21] Jesus said now is the son of man
[10:24] glorified and go now son of man right
[10:27] now what is the son of man the word made
[10:30] flesh GL not Son of God he look how it's
[10:33] it's it's very specific it says now is
[10:36] the son of man
[10:38] glorified and God is glorified in him
[10:42] amen but now watch if God be glorified
[10:45] in him God shall also glorify him in
[10:49] himself they're one amen all
[10:52] right and shall straightway glorify him
[10:56] so in other words he's going to be
[10:58] glorified he's glorifying the father
[11:01] then we got the son of man which is the
[11:02] word made flesh which is God in human
[11:04] flesh all right so that's what he's
[11:06] saying he's putting all all these
[11:08] together just like where it says in John
[11:11] 14 that I and you and you and me all
[11:14] right same thing it's putting it
[11:15] together not separating it putting it
[11:17] together all right so let's go to one
[11:19] more and let's see because remember
[11:23] remember the voice Came From Heaven I
[11:25] have both glorified it and will glorify
[11:29] it again all right so he's glorified it
[11:32] and going to glorify it again and we're
[11:34] just going to take one point here and
[11:36] look at
[11:37] it because there's two glorifications
[11:39] all right St John Matthew uh St John St
[11:42] Matthew
[11:44] 179 now here's the one that we always go
[11:47] to and and uh and read where Jesus was
[11:50] on the mountain and this is the adoption
[11:53] stage right this is where you know Jesus
[11:55] was up on the mountain and God said hear
[11:57] ye him but remember he was there with
[11:59] two characters Moses and Elijah so keep
[12:02] that in your head for a little while
[12:04] because we're going to use it at the end
[12:05] of the
[12:06] service as they came down from the
[12:09] mountain Jesus charged them saying tell
[12:11] the vision to no man until the son of
[12:16] man not the Son of God right the son of
[12:20] man be risen
[12:22] again from the dead so that means he's
[12:25] going to raise two
[12:27] times right right he raised physically
[12:31] back there 2,000 years ago and he's
[12:34] raised in the end time right in a group
[12:36] of people all right so now keep that in
[12:39] your mind and and look because you're
[12:41] seeing that it's the son of man it's the
[12:44] word made flesh Jesus is saying son of
[12:46] man son of man son of man and so we see
[12:48] in the end time that we know what that
[12:51] son of man is all the other people in
[12:53] the other ages didn't know what the son
[12:55] of man was they just knew that God was
[12:57] in human flesh yeah
[13:00] okay then that only happened for about
[13:03] two Church ages because in about the
[13:05] Third Church age it became a like
[13:07] substance of God and they started using
[13:09] Father Son and Holy Ghost even the
[13:14] Believers amen come on Luther was a
[13:17] trinitarian Wesley was a TR
[13:19] trinitarian they took that Doctrine from
[13:24] ncia back in 3:25 and 606 they took that
[13:28] and they established it and God winked
[13:30] at that and said that's okay but I'm
[13:32] going to glorify it like I had glorified
[13:34] it before all right the son of man is
[13:37] going to raise again because without the
[13:38] son of man you don't have a body change
[13:41] all right you can have the Son of God
[13:42] all you want to now listen for for those
[13:44] of you that hadn't been here for a while
[13:46] the Son of God is God in spirit form all
[13:50] right does everybody understand that he
[13:52] died son of man he raised Son of God all
[13:55] right then what happened the Son of God
[13:58] is the Holy Ghost right that comes back
[14:01] on the day of Pentecost in a group of
[14:03] Believers right which put them in the
[14:06] body of Christ but now it it did put
[14:09] them in a position but don't get me
[14:11] don't get don't say something I'm not
[14:12] saying they were at a position but they
[14:15] couldn't come to full Authority right
[14:17] right because they had took the father
[14:20] son Holy Ghost baptism they took it hell
[14:22] was eternal they took these things that
[14:25] you can marry whoever you want to just
[14:26] like he said you know in marriage and
[14:28] divorce and all these they got all
[14:29] scrupled up and God couldn't use them
[14:33] now look God used the son of man amen it
[14:37] was the son of God working through the
[14:39] son of man
[14:42] right Son of God working through the son
[14:45] of man not two different people right
[14:47] but the spirit in Jesus Christ was the
[14:49] Son of God the Creator right cuz
[14:52] remember they told him they said you're
[14:53] the Creator God you're the one that
[14:54] created the world well that Jesus flesh
[14:56] man was not the one that did it right
[14:59] that was a creation sure it came from
[15:01] God and it was God right if it come from
[15:04] God it had to be God if God created it
[15:06] it had to be God especially if he dwell
[15:08] in it all right now but I want you to
[15:13] look at the two things that in Jesus's
[15:16] life because I want you to see something
[15:18] here I think it's something that we're
[15:20] missing but just kind of pencil this in
[15:23] your
[15:24] brain Jesus started at a
[15:27] river
[15:29] with a glorification right this is my
[15:32] beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell
[15:34] he was identifying where he was God was
[15:37] identifying the person that he was
[15:39] dwelling in cuz he was pleased to dwell
[15:41] in that person then you come on the
[15:43] mountain and it's not just that he's
[15:45] he's pleased to dwell in that person
[15:47] that person has come to a position to
[15:49] where the father says hear ye him right
[15:52] all right so it said so we got two
[15:55] places of glorification we got the river
[15:57] and a mountain
[16:00] now you start your
[16:02] journey in a
[16:04] river and end it on a
[16:07] mountain same thing amen cuz we have to
[16:10] have something to look at we have to
[16:13] have some a guide and Jesus is the guide
[16:15] right right not any other man there's no
[16:17] other perfect man except Jesus Christ
[16:22] right but I'm going to sting you here
[16:24] for a
[16:25] second because watch brother Brandman
[16:29] 1962 go aead and pull that quote up
[16:32] statue of a perfect man 10:14
[16:36] 1962 this is the part I
[16:39] missed that the Lord said go back and
[16:42] read
[16:43] this cuz I think we're missing it and I
[16:46] know brother Bown say we're missing it
[16:47] in life and that's exactly where we're
[16:49] missing it at okay but I I have them I
[16:52] have a big note here says everybody
[16:54] wants to know about the seal see my
[16:55] Sunday school class was full when I was
[16:57] preaching on this when I was teaching on
[16:58] on the seals but now statue perfect man
[17:00] half the people don't come it's reverse
[17:03] people you don't know one thing about
[17:05] the seals until you're right here
[17:09] exactly was brother
[17:12] brandham adopted and then God gave him
[17:16] the SE revelation of the seals you think
[17:18] you're any better than William
[17:21] brandham I don't think
[17:23] so watch what he says now we are
[17:26] approaching the seven
[17:30] seals we have just finished the seven
[17:33] Church
[17:34] ages right cuz the seven Church ages if
[17:37] you look in the church seven Church ages
[17:38] in the church age book there's your
[17:40] doctrines that were missed down through
[17:42] the church ages right that's where the
[17:44] Son of God was working but the son of
[17:48] man couldn't work right amen son of man
[17:52] couldn't work because he was bound by
[17:54] Creeds and dogmas like Dy is preaching
[17:56] to now and same thing with us with the
[17:58] Holy Ghost goes we're Bound by our own
[18:01] Creeds and denominational ideas right
[18:03] now all
[18:05] right you say why cuz we're still
[18:09] here once we leave out of here the son
[18:12] of man could leave out of here yeah
[18:14] that's right all right he went up he
[18:17] went through walls went up did anything
[18:19] he wanted to all power in heaven and
[18:20] Earth's been given unto me right so
[18:24] don't think we can get there any less
[18:26] but this is the part I was missing but
[18:28] watch just line up right here all right
[18:30] now we are approaching the Seven Seals
[18:32] now the seals were preached in
[18:34] 1963 right March of 1963 got it right
[18:39] watch how brother Brown builds up now
[18:41] they don't have this on the screen but
[18:42] I'm going to read it to you in a minute
[18:44] the sermons that brother Brandon
[18:46] preached between the church ages and the
[18:49] seals all right and the ones that are
[18:51] important that I think is important now
[18:53] we are approaching the Seven Seals we
[18:55] have just finished the church ages all
[18:57] right he's finished something here
[18:59] he's going to the seals over here but
[19:01] now watch what he says and this is a
[19:02] message on teaching to tie the man in
[19:07] right to tie the man in
[19:11] amen that's going to be
[19:14] redeemed I thought you were already
[19:15] redeemed if you born again you are
[19:17] potentially right but not fully right
[19:21] right amen this is yes this is no you
[19:26] can amen a little bit louder
[19:33] praise the Lord that's going to be
[19:35] Redeemed by the blood of the Lord Jesus
[19:38] and is going to be in that church age
[19:40] now watch him he
[19:42] stops not one of the seven Church
[19:45] ages he says that Eternal Church age at
[19:50] the end of the seals
[19:52] amen so he's placing he's
[19:56] placing what he's doing doing because
[19:59] look what he said right down below that
[20:01] and I thought that would this would tie
[20:02] in just where I was expecting amen he's
[20:05] talking about the Statue of a perfect
[20:07] man now the he brother Brown preached
[20:09] the church
[20:10] ages then he preached the spoken word is
[20:13] Original Seed he thought he had preached
[20:15] everything and he said as of yet M you
[20:17] remember the Holy Ghost said pick up
[20:18] your pen and write as of yet Malachi 4
[20:20] has not been made manifest so brother
[20:22] Bram knew that Ministry had to move on
[20:23] it hadn't stopped it had to move all
[20:25] right then he preached Daniel said 70
[20:28] weeks then he preached before the the
[20:32] Sunday before he preached this he
[20:33] preached on the key amen and he said the
[20:37] key is Faith and Christ is the door amen
[20:40] all right then he preached the statue of
[20:43] a perfect man and that night he preached
[20:45] on a guide right or the guide of my life
[20:48] all right so watch what he's doing then
[20:51] the next month he preaches on
[20:53] Blasphemous names and he brings it into
[20:56] the statue of a perfect man a higher
[20:57] order
[20:58] order of the Statue of a perfect man
[21:01] instead of just having faith virtue and
[21:02] all his tempers patience all right he
[21:04] goes through Blasphemous names and then
[21:07] he preaches the seals so you see how God
[21:09] is bringing the
[21:11] man William brandham to a place and
[21:15] that's what he's saying here he said I
[21:17] thought this would tie in just where I
[21:18] was expecting he could see that there
[21:21] was something coming he knew Malachi 4
[21:24] hadn't been made manifest yet he knew
[21:26] there was something to come but because
[21:28] he had preached to hear amen now that's
[21:32] not a complete head that's not a
[21:34] complete pyramid right right amen got to
[21:38] have a cap on it and then remember he
[21:41] had there was a dream sister shepher had
[21:43] a dream where we read it downstairs
[21:45] where s sister Shephard had a dream and
[21:46] it wasn't the one where he ripped the
[21:48] top off and looked down in it now that's
[21:49] a different dream this one of sister
[21:51] shepher she had the dream brother
[21:53] brandom saw the dream and interpret it
[21:55] that there was water flowing out of a
[21:57] box a Mountain a man was pouring water
[22:00] in the box and trash was coming out well
[22:03] as I told him in the Sunday school class
[22:04] that's exactly what the statue of a
[22:06] perfect man does right it gets the extra
[22:09] trash out exactly cuz you don't have
[22:11] trash in your soul if you're born
[22:15] again but you do have trash in your
[22:17] spirit now we're not even going to talk
[22:19] about the body because I believe the
[22:21] body is motivated by the others right
[22:24] the body just reacts to what's inside of
[22:26] it so we can't say the body made me do
[22:29] this or or you know you can't say that
[22:33] cuz what motivated cuz you can uh Lord
[22:37] bless brother Bill but he's laying up
[22:38] there now and he can't move well now his
[22:41] body is controlled by whatever's inside
[22:44] he's still there his spirit's still
[22:45] working his Soul's still working but he
[22:48] can't there's something happened to the
[22:50] body all right electrodes and all the
[22:53] things that that brother Brown said
[22:54] Cosmic light so let's go to the book of
[22:56] Ephesians
[22:58] and we see that brother brandham has
[22:59] brought us to a place you see what's
[23:01] going
[23:02] on brother Bram God just didn't bring
[23:06] the seals and just dump them in his lap
[23:08] right and he's not going to dump them in
[23:10] yours amen that's right exactly so
[23:14] everybody wants to talk about Seal Seal
[23:16] Seal Seal seals what about that right
[23:19] what about that fully working in an
[23:21] individual brother Brown said a walking
[23:24] breathing instrumentality of God that's
[23:27] what he had to come to before God showed
[23:29] him the seal amen all right so let's
[23:32] just don't think well this statue of a
[23:33] perfect man well that's just something
[23:34] good to live by no I'm going to tell you
[23:36] something in just a minute that may blow
[23:38] your socks off all right for those of
[23:39] you that do have socks on for those of
[23:41] you that
[23:42] don't it just knock your shoes off I
[23:45] guess Ephesians 1 and whom also we have
[23:49] obtained an
[23:51] inheritance remember Jesus didn't come
[23:53] to bring you an inheritance right right
[23:56] he came to bring you the the way back to
[23:58] your inheritance the door how to get in
[24:01] and how to go cuz your inheritance is
[24:03] eternal life predestinated before the
[24:04] foundation of the world you know I was
[24:07] thinking I was thinking today I have a
[24:09] lot of time to think sitting on that
[24:11] lawnmower and I enjoy it cuz remember I
[24:13] told you when I used to cut grass out
[24:14] here i' could preach my best sermons to
[24:16] that lawnmower so we had about 3 hours
[24:18] of just pure you know gutting and
[24:21] strutting with a lawnmower today and I
[24:23] had a lot of time to sing and pray and
[24:26] preach this sermon yeah and I probably
[24:28] got a little bit more out of the
[24:29] lawnmower at least it hollered the whole
[24:31] time some of y'all are wanting to go
[24:33] back to the
[24:35] house it's just what's motivating you
[24:39] inside but I thought about it today
[24:41] brother dick you know people say we were
[24:44] born with this seed in
[24:46] us
[24:48] predestinated but the only thing that
[24:49] was predestinated we know was the mind
[24:53] of God the word of God that's what's
[24:56] predestinated but now remember
[24:59] where did you come from
[25:01] naturally you didn't come naturally born
[25:05] with the seed that brought you
[25:07] here your father had the seed all the
[25:11] time right your father had the
[25:15] seed so where do we have to get our seed
[25:19] from the father we wouldn't come here
[25:21] born with it right that's
[25:23] right cuz remember brother Brown said
[25:25] even your father it was in you were in
[25:26] your great-grandfather what in the seed
[25:28] line the gene line right but you come
[25:32] when your father produced the seed not
[25:35] you exactly you don't produce it the
[25:38] father produces it right and if you
[25:40] weren't in him you're not of him right
[25:44] but if you were you got to come forth
[25:46] amen cuz God doesn't just like brother
[25:49] Ram said you you have god making you
[25:51] know having sex like with Mary but no he
[25:53] when he speaks it happens Glory when he
[25:56] speaks it's done when he speaks a seed
[25:59] comes forth it's not just one that's all
[26:01] messed up or one that's this and that
[26:03] and the other no he brings his own
[26:04] children all right so that just kind of
[26:07] struck me today that hey that is where
[26:09] the seed life comes to the father amen
[26:12] the father has to give the seed to give
[26:14] life right the father has to give it so
[26:18] that's where our seed come from our seed
[26:19] Gene that's predestinated was in the
[26:23] father and then brother Brown said in
[26:25] the bedding ground what's the B ground
[26:28] the word your mother is New Jerusalem
[26:31] that's the beding ground when the father
[26:33] releases that seed you coincide with
[26:36] what's in this word right not anything
[26:38] else what's in this word is where you
[26:40] where you get your Eternal destination
[26:44] or Preparation or predestination you're
[26:46] not predestinated by your Mom and Daddy
[26:48] right they didn't know you were
[26:51] coming he did
[26:54] amen that's what I love about God he
[26:57] knows that everything glory in whom also
[26:59] we have obtained an inheritance being
[27:01] predestinated according to our
[27:05] purpose no it says according to the
[27:07] purpose of him who worketh all things
[27:10] after the counsel of his own will that's
[27:12] what I mean you were that seed you were
[27:14] a seed in your
[27:16] father amen your mother would just
[27:19] produce the body right your father
[27:21] produced a life all right so how would
[27:24] you how' you come here born with the
[27:25] seed of your own self you can't you got
[27:28] to receive the seed from your father in
[27:31] the beding ground to become you same way
[27:34] with the word of God same way with your
[27:35] new birth you got to receive seed from
[27:38] the Father which is eternal life right
[27:41] right spoken word is the Original Seed
[27:44] all right now look that we should be to
[27:46] the praise of his glory he first trusted
[27:48] in
[27:49] Christ in whom ye also trusted after
[27:52] that you heard the word of Truth The
[27:54] Gospel of your salvation in whom also
[27:56] after that you believe
[27:58] D you were sealed with that Holy Spirit
[28:00] of
[28:01] Promise which is the earnest you've
[28:03] heard this many times before but but
[28:05] let's let's split this thing apart and
[28:08] look at it and see because this is your
[28:10] earnest
[28:12] amen but not the full possession right
[28:16] all right this is your
[28:17] earnest your daddy gives you a check
[28:20] with his name on it right it says you
[28:23] write it I'll produce
[28:25] it right but when you get to a place in
[28:29] God he gives you a blank
[28:31] check you write it out for whatever
[28:34] amount you want and God will cash it and
[28:37] you have you sign your own name amen
[28:41] exactly so let's split this apart now
[28:43] we're not talking about two holy ghosts
[28:45] we're talking about the same Holy Ghost
[28:47] but just a
[28:48] refilling but I want you to see how this
[28:51] happens because it happened in Jesus's
[28:54] life amen in type he didn't need the
[28:57] Holy Ghost right he had the Holy Ghost
[29:00] he was the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost was
[29:02] the spirit that motivated him the spirit
[29:04] in Sun Times and diers manners that
[29:06] spake through the prophets that was the
[29:07] spirit inside of Jesus that's why he
[29:10] could know and I didn't bring the quote
[29:11] but I was looking at it last night where
[29:13] brother brandham said that's why you
[29:15] don't know all things and that's why he
[29:16] did or he knew behind when he got here
[29:19] he knew where he come from we we just
[29:21] appeared right you know we just we just
[29:24] we had a time we were blacked out
[29:25] brother Brown said we our minds blacked
[29:27] out we were with the
[29:29] father in The spoken word we were with
[29:31] him but it was blackened out but Jesus
[29:35] could come and he could tell before
[29:37] Abraham was I am I was back there with
[29:40] Moses I was the one that did what now
[29:42] you you and I can't do that but he was
[29:45] literally
[29:46] there in the Son of
[29:49] God it was the son of God all right cuz
[29:52] it was Spirit God God wasn't in human
[29:54] flesh yet he was using human flesh but
[29:56] he wasn't in human flesh yet all
[29:59] right but look which is the earnest of
[30:01] our
[30:02] inheritance what's our inheritance
[30:05] eternal life Body Spirit and soul right
[30:09] Body Spirit and soul not just soul body
[30:11] spirit and soul all right which is the
[30:14] earnest of our inheritance
[30:16] until the Redemption of the purchased
[30:19] possession unto the praise of his glory
[30:22] not ours all right brother Brown said in
[30:25] 1962 on question question and answers
[30:27] let's go to the next
[30:30] one talking about on Easter
[30:32] morning just scroll down to the part
[30:35] there that we want to read I'll give you
[30:38] the earnest of your inheritance and then
[30:40] what
[30:42] happened on the day of Pentecost the
[30:45] Holy Spirit came upon the Believers
[30:48] there was the down payment right that's
[30:51] the earnest money all right so that's
[30:54] the part that you and I
[30:58] get at our new birth we get an
[31:01] Earnest all right not the full
[31:05] possession everybody in the building
[31:08] amen
[31:09] okay but I want you to think I'd like
[31:12] for me to realize you're here
[31:16] yeah if this was a ball game you'd treat
[31:19] it a whole lot
[31:21] different it'll motivate you this this
[31:24] must not that's what I mean about this
[31:26] if this don't motivate us you can forget
[31:28] about the seals amen you can forget
[31:31] about it it's like I told him downstairs
[31:32] I said look I believe this is what I
[31:34] believe now I'm talking about me too I
[31:36] believe we have a knowledge of the seals
[31:41] amen
[31:43] amen but it's brother Dale's
[31:50] Revelation or we wouldn't act the way we
[31:54] do H cuz brother brandham had a
[31:58] knowledge of the seals and preached them
[32:01] amen that's right but when he come and
[32:03] preached the seals and he preached um
[32:06] Satan's Eden and all these different
[32:08] ones about the garden all he said all
[32:10] that was revealed in the seals right
[32:12] he'd already preached it he had a
[32:15] knowledge but when it come to the seals
[32:17] he had a
[32:18] revelation and when you get a revelation
[32:21] right that's different right amen but I
[32:23] just believe we got a knowledge of
[32:24] brother Dale that he knows what the
[32:25] seals are I'm sorry told you to knock
[32:28] your socks
[32:29] off maybe some of
[32:31] you well it's going to it's going to
[32:33] make people either dig or or die one of
[32:35] the two right dig or die one of the two
[32:38] I'm sorry it's just we either got
[32:41] to lead follow get out of the
[32:46] way well hey how I mean look
[32:50] people
[32:53] look the Bible says that we're supposed
[32:55] to come to church more as the day
[32:57] approaches than we do before and some of
[32:59] you ain't seen in two
[33:01] weeks some of you ain't seen your wife
[33:03] and kids in the month where you at but
[33:06] oh you ready to go you got you know what
[33:08] the seals are no you got a knowledge of
[33:09] what he's
[33:11] got we got a knowledge of somebody
[33:13] else's truth that will kill you exactly
[33:18] that'll kill
[33:21] you you're a dead man walking right if
[33:24] that's what it is I'm talking to all of
[33:26] us
[33:28] because
[33:29] look go to John 16:13 now brother Brown
[33:33] says on the day of Pentecost the earnest
[33:35] the down
[33:36] payment now it's it's
[33:39] important you got to have a down payment
[33:41] for you buy the house right that's just
[33:45] required man must have got that from the
[33:47] Bible brother Donnie you know we need a
[33:50] down payment we need an Earnest do what
[33:55] we that's what's wrong with yeah that's
[33:57] right well you're exactly
[34:01] correct but you know you can look at
[34:04] this thing and see that how God is
[34:06] working because he does he he the bank's
[34:10] a little leery of you when they first
[34:12] let you borrow some money so they don't
[34:14] give you a lot of checks to write out of
[34:16] that or whatever if you if you get a a
[34:18] line of credit or something you know but
[34:20] you know what about 10 years down the
[34:22] road if you've done everything
[34:24] right come on about 10 or 10 or 12 years
[34:28] down the road you do everything right
[34:30] they can check your credit anytime they
[34:31] want to check it you don't get nervous
[34:33] when they start checking your credit now
[34:35] buddy when somebody gets nervous when
[34:36] they checking your credit you're in
[34:38] trouble but you see that same way with
[34:40] God that's the same way with God after a
[34:43] length of time we're going to see it
[34:45] happen to Jesus so it's going to have to
[34:47] happen to us after a certain length of
[34:48] time God don't get nervous we know God
[34:51] don't get nervous but he trust you with
[34:54] more the bank trust you with more you
[34:56] can walk in there and talk to that guy
[34:58] face to
[34:59] face that's what I told him before I
[35:01] said I in all the business I've ever
[35:03] been in I can walk back in that bank and
[35:04] I can look at Banker right in the eye
[35:06] cuz I have nothing to hide I have
[35:08] nothing I've done nothing wrong with
[35:10] money I've done I've done paid all what
[35:12] I need to pay so I don't all right what
[35:14] if you
[35:16] don't the Banker's not going to trust
[35:18] you right right you mishandle the word
[35:22] God's not going to trust you it's really
[35:25] simple
[35:27] it's all about life amen right cuz you
[35:30] know what we live life a lot more than
[35:32] we live other things life is a 24/7 deal
[35:36] okay except when you're sleeping and
[35:37] when you're sleeping you're still
[35:38] working right all right but now look
[35:41] let's see how let's see how this splits
[35:45] and and I don't like to say split but
[35:46] there is a split because God even said
[35:49] he said I've glorified
[35:51] it and I'll glorify it
[35:54] again
[35:55] okay so there's two different
[35:59] glorifications sure there's many
[36:01] refilling but I want to key on these two
[36:03] River and Mountain cuz that's the same
[36:06] way you and I got to start at a river
[36:08] and end on a mountain all right so now
[36:11] how be it when he the spirit of Truth is
[36:14] come he will guide you into all truth
[36:18] guide all right for he shall not speak
[36:22] of
[36:24] himself you got it right but whosoever
[36:28] he shall
[36:29] hear that shall he
[36:32] speak but whatsoever he shall hear what
[36:35] coming from you right that shall he
[36:37] speak and he will show you things to
[36:41] come right right so as you as you have
[36:44] the Holy Ghost here at Faith God's going
[36:47] to show you things to
[36:50] come a furtherment on the Revelation you
[36:53] get a revelation that you know what you
[36:55] were lost
[36:57] you needed God you needed
[37:00] salvation you needed something besides
[37:03] what you were yeah all right but now
[37:06] remember if we still do what we
[37:12] were you're not him in this picture
[37:14] right all right so come on now now I
[37:17] told him downstairs in second Peter 1
[37:20] the Bible says add to your faith virtue
[37:22] virtue knowledge and what did I tell
[37:24] y'all
[37:25] downstairs add to what you
[37:29] have because if you don't have it you
[37:31] can't add
[37:33] it second Peter one says add to your
[37:36] faith virtue or add to what you have or
[37:40] add to your
[37:42] revelation of Faith
[37:44] virtue add to what you have knowledge
[37:47] add to what you have Temperance add to
[37:49] what you have patience right cuz you got
[37:51] to add it to what you have you can't add
[37:53] it to something else right you can't add
[37:55] it to some gre's Almanac or or James
[37:59] Dobson you can't add nothing to that all
[38:01] right not even God anyway because
[38:04] remember Peter at the gate
[38:08] beautiful the guy
[38:10] says I need some arms I need you know I
[38:13] need some
[38:14] help and Peter probably reached in his
[38:17] billfold and he
[38:18] said it's been a slim day at the fish
[38:21] market this week no you know what Peter
[38:24] said Peter and said Silver and Gold Have
[38:25] I known another words I can't produce
[38:27] the money to give to you to go to the
[38:30] doctor to help your infirmity right
[38:33] that's what he was saying right but he
[38:36] said Silver and Gold Have I None in
[38:38] other words I don't have the
[38:40] funds that I can say here go go see the
[38:42] doctor right he said but what I do have
[38:47] Bible says such as I have right what he
[38:50] had the virtues working in his life such
[38:53] as I have give I unto thee right rise up
[38:57] and walk amen and you know what the guy
[39:00] Drew from that checking
[39:04] account cuz Peter was full of money amen
[39:08] not this kind of
[39:10] money he was full of
[39:12] funds he had enough virtue that he could
[39:15] keep some and give some out Jesus had
[39:18] enough virtue to keep some and give some
[39:20] out cuz Peter said such as I have right
[39:23] he didn't know how to name it this was
[39:26] before he wrote second
[39:28] Peter so he had to
[39:30] develop and I believe when he wrote
[39:32] second Peter 1 he was going that's what
[39:35] happened at the gate
[39:37] beautiful I had virtue in my life enough
[39:41] to where that guy could draw and the
[39:43] check don't bounce right ain't that what
[39:46] brother Bram said right brother Bram
[39:48] said you try to draw off funds and the
[39:49] check bounces why there's no money there
[39:51] or there's no funds there so Peter said
[39:54] Silver and Gold Have I None but such as
[39:55] I have
[39:57] amen give I unto
[39:59] thee so what Jesus was telling them
[40:02] Jesus was showing them said look when he
[40:04] there in John when he said I'll show you
[40:07] things to
[40:08] come he was telling them he said hey
[40:11] when I come
[40:13] back when I come back the spirit of
[40:16] truth I'm going to be the spirit of
[40:18] truth I'm your guide comforter counselor
[40:21] Prince of Peace all those things I am
[40:23] the god of your
[40:25] life kind strange brother Brown preached
[40:27] the guide of my life that night he knew
[40:28] what was leading and guiding him up that
[40:31] statue of a perfect man amen for he
[40:33] shall not speak of himself but who
[40:35] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[40:38] speak and he shall show you things to
[40:39] come so there was a furtherment of not
[40:42] just you must be born again all right
[40:44] there's more to that because there's
[40:47] more to the baby amen de five tomorrow
[40:51] one time she was five minutes
[40:54] old there's a difference but it's the
[40:56] same person right a big difference had
[40:59] all her faculties she had all her
[41:01] fingers she had all her toes she had all
[41:03] of her faculties to use but she don't
[41:06] use them like she does now I'll promise
[41:09] you that she's sitting in there back
[41:12] there now drawing well she couldn't draw
[41:14] at 5 minutes old why she developed
[41:20] right cuz she was born now the statue of
[41:23] a perfect
[41:25] man
[41:27] notice this is statute of perfect man
[41:29] Jeffersonville this is right at first
[41:31] paragraph 102 notice you must be born
[41:34] again and when you're born again you
[41:36] can't be born again without having faith
[41:38] right all right so here right here
[41:41] here's the Holy Ghost working right here
[41:43] right okay right Elementary but we're
[41:46] getting somewhere with this all right so
[41:48] this is this is the first
[41:52] time God's glorified
[41:55] you
[41:57] CU if he said I'm pleased to
[41:58] dwell he said the same thing to you it's
[42:01] in your birth all right I'm pleased to
[42:02] dwell in this vessel all right notice
[42:05] you must be born again when you're born
[42:06] again you can't be born again without
[42:07] having faith that's right so you see on
[42:09] my chart here I got the very Foundation
[42:12] faith is the
[42:14] foundation of it right all right let's
[42:17] go to the second one of the number
[42:20] six you've got to be born again and born
[42:23] again it produces Faith all right then
[42:26] after you get Faith this right here f t
[42:28] I think he's pointing down here at the
[42:30] chart then you're just in position of
[42:33] growing
[42:37] amen you're just in position of
[42:41] growing you're just in position of
[42:44] growing
[42:46] amen all right so now Jesus at the river
[42:50] when Jesus Come to the River and come up
[42:52] out of his
[42:54] baptism the sound from heaven was this
[42:56] is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to
[42:58] dwell right stop there in whom I'm
[43:00] pleased to dwell all right now that is a
[43:03] type we know he does not need the Holy
[43:04] Ghost but there's a type something did
[43:07] come something did descend on
[43:10] Jesus all
[43:12] right we know it was a a part of the
[43:15] ministry that he had for the three and a
[43:16] half years but now you and I you have
[43:18] use that as a type because it is when he
[43:21] said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[43:23] pleased to dwell so he's pinpointing
[43:25] right
[43:26] brother Brown said called it one time
[43:28] his coronation day well see on the
[43:30] coronation day you don't you don't Crown
[43:33] a king to make him a
[43:35] king you produce the king and say here
[43:38] is the King this is the guy that's going
[43:41] to lead the country that's your
[43:42] coronation day all right that's what
[43:45] that Jesus was that God was doing he was
[43:47] saying this is where I'm going to be at
[43:50] least for three and A2 years right this
[43:51] is where I'm going to be and I'm going
[43:53] to be
[43:54] speaking and I'm I'm going to be
[43:57] producing my children from this oh
[43:59] yeah right didn't what brother Bri said
[44:03] I can't remember where he said it but he
[44:04] said this is my part of the earth that I
[44:06] have redeemed right and from this part
[44:09] of the earth I'll redeem others in other
[44:11] words paraphrasing hope I don't get in
[44:13] trouble doing that like Claude said you
[44:14] can paraphrase a scripture but you
[44:15] better not paraphrase a
[44:20] quote he said they'll burn you hide
[44:23] so that's fine with me
[44:27] cuz you know what we're not going to be
[44:29] carrying these around in
[44:31] heaven we're going to become this when
[44:34] John ate the book it
[44:36] disappeared and the next time it showed
[44:38] up was at the white Throne judgment cuz
[44:40] that's where we were and the book was
[44:42] open all right so Jesus at the River
[44:45] Watch but now you say well Jesus was God
[44:48] and he this and he okay go to Luke
[44:53] 2 and the child grew GRE and white
[44:57] strong in
[44:58] spirit filled with wisdom and the grace
[45:02] of God was upon him now this was after
[45:05] that he was found in the temple at 12
[45:08] years old and he said I must be about my
[45:10] father's business and then he went on
[45:12] with this with u with Mary and and
[45:15] Joseph all right so the Bible says in
[45:17] Luke he's he's he's narrating it and
[45:20] he's saying the child grew and whack
[45:22] strong in spirit filled with wisdom
[45:24] knowledge wisdom
[45:27] right and Jesus increased in wisdom and
[45:30] stature now that's not
[45:32] statue right that doesn't mean he grew
[45:34] up
[45:35] taller stature right all right and in
[45:39] favor with God and
[45:42] man so he went from somewhere to
[45:45] somewhere right that's right and Jesus
[45:49] increased in wisdom and stature and in
[45:52] favor with God and man now let's look at
[45:54] Hebrews 5 and8
[45:57] Hebrews 5:8 says though he were a
[46:00] son yet learned he
[46:04] obedience by the things which he
[46:06] suffered right and being made perfect
[46:10] amen are complete we know Jesus was
[46:12] perfect but he was being made complete
[46:15] what he was the Statue of a perfect man
[46:17] so he had to have these things working
[46:19] in his life but at 13 years
[46:22] old he
[46:24] didn't he didn't he didn't have all he
[46:26] didn't even know when he was coming back
[46:28] until we're going to read that in a
[46:29] minute about the glorification on the
[46:31] mount Transfiguration right right
[46:34] remember brother R said he didn't know
[46:35] anything about his
[46:36] coming Moses and Elijah had to tell him
[46:39] when he was glorified all right so the
[46:42] man Jesus grew being made perfect he
[46:45] became the author of Eternal
[46:48] salvation now it doesn't stop there it
[46:51] says unto all them that obey him
[46:56] amen brothers and sisters this is
[46:59] obedience
[47:01] right this is
[47:03] obedience plain and simple this is
[47:06] obedience and Jesus became
[47:09] obedient because he was made
[47:12] complete so he became the author of
[47:14] Eternal salvation for those that obey
[47:16] him amen all
[47:19] right that's why I said everybody says
[47:21] they want to know about the seals about
[47:22] the seals well Jesus in Matthew 17 he
[47:25] preached the seals in what Matthew
[47:28] 24 right Matthew 17 he found out about
[47:32] when he was
[47:34] coming so he had to grow in Grace and
[47:36] knowledge he had to grow up the word
[47:39] made
[47:40] flesh because look this is where we're
[47:43] missing it amen right here let me give
[47:46] you a let me give you a wayale quote and
[47:48] I'm going to paraphrase this one because
[47:51] this mine I'm the author of
[47:53] it the virtues are
[47:56] requirement to understand how the son of
[47:59] man acted on
[48:01] Earth until we see and know how the son
[48:05] of man acted on
[48:08] Earth we know he we know the Son of God
[48:11] we know how he acted he created the
[48:13] world he was the Jehovah God he was the
[48:16] one that looked over his children he was
[48:17] the one that did this and that and the
[48:19] other got it but the son of man comes
[48:21] down to one individual
[48:23] person and that was the word made flesh
[48:27] and without these virtues that's why
[48:29] they're a requirement cuz you can't be
[48:32] the son of
[48:34] man bride supposed to be the son of man
[48:36] in the end time right you can't be the
[48:38] son of man without these virtues working
[48:39] in your life cuz you don't know how he
[48:42] acted that's right or reacted for some
[48:46] of us so that's why everybody wants to
[48:49] know about the
[48:51] seals
[48:54] why cuz that somebody else is good
[48:58] Revelation I'm saying brother Dale's got
[49:00] a perfect understanding of the
[49:04] C but is it just that we understand what
[49:07] he
[49:11] understands Judas had an understanding
[49:13] of who Jesus
[49:17] was that's why but that's why brothers
[49:20] and sisters that's so close right that's
[49:22] the
[49:23] closeness it ain't these false Doctrine
[49:25] is out here no it's not it's right here
[49:30] it's whether you've got your own
[49:32] personal revelation that you have virtue
[49:35] that you have knowledge that you have
[49:38] Temperance that you have patience that
[49:40] you have godliness brotherly kindness
[49:42] cuz we're going to see see that Holy
[49:43] Spirit that's why I saw the
[49:45] split and actually Sunday sister Trudy
[49:48] and I were we clicked on brother Aaron
[49:50] McGary preaching out in Kansas and he
[49:53] was preaching on the same identical
[49:55] thing
[49:57] about the about the glorification and
[49:59] that you know that's kind of where I put
[50:00] all this together about already we'd
[50:01] already talked about it in Sunday school
[50:03] class but see Jesus come to a
[50:07] place to where when he went on that
[50:10] mountain God said this is my beloved Son
[50:13] in whom I'm pleased to dwell he didn't
[50:14] forget that part but then he said hear
[50:17] ye him I have usted all of my
[50:23] virtues about it it's where we got to be
[50:26] I have God is saying this I have
[50:28] entrusted all my virtues in you that's
[50:36] right father glorify thy name John 12
[50:39] let's go back to it just a
[50:41] second father glorify thy name then came
[50:44] there a voice from Heaven saying I have
[50:46] both glorified it at the river and
[50:50] glorified again right now whatever
[50:53] scripture is for him has got to be for
[50:55] us amen cuz we're the bride we're the
[50:57] end time we're his body here on Earth
[50:59] right so we have to be the son of man
[51:02] come on the word made
[51:04] flesh that's why that's why I had to
[51:06] come back to this cuz we I was just
[51:08] going to go start through the virtues
[51:09] and we were just going to go up the
[51:11] virtues and I believe the Lord stopped
[51:13] me and said look to know how the son of
[51:15] man acted on Earth that's what these
[51:18] virtues are for they're not just
[51:20] something that brother randam stuck in
[51:21] between the seals and the church ages to
[51:24] fill it's not a filler that's right
[51:26] right I believe from 1960 on you could
[51:29] see him he had a pattern of where he was
[51:31] going and he even said it on that quote
[51:33] he said I saw where this fit right
[51:36] in so that's what happened is God was
[51:39] remember it wasn't brother Brown's
[51:41] message right it was God's message to me
[51:44] and you a lot of it wasn't even to
[51:52] him he's
[51:54] gone oh my he's
[51:57] gone he's not even we are we are which
[52:00] are alive and remain
[52:03] anymore right
[52:06] right come
[52:08] on but God promised the father promised
[52:12] he was going to glorify it and glorify
[52:14] it again so in the end time this is
[52:17] where we see that and this is not just a
[52:20] good-look chart that says oh we we need
[52:22] to do this no it's a requirement but
[52:23] it's a requirement to know
[52:27] how to know how to fit this onto this
[52:30] right
[52:32] exactly there's the seals amen that's
[52:35] right see you see oh we want to know the
[52:36] seals so as people come in they go oh we
[52:38] want to hear about the seals so we'll go
[52:39] down in hear Brother Wade about the
[52:40] seals there'll be 18,000 people in the
[52:43] in the um downstairs in the Sunday
[52:45] school class hey I'm telling you it
[52:46] hurts my feelings and then you start
[52:48] talking about life and the virtues and
[52:50] people disappear they ain't got time
[52:54] right right
[52:56] come on Pastor am I right come on people
[52:59] we got this thing
[53:05] backwards this all the way up to
[53:09] here is what
[53:11] Peter James John and Paul already had
[53:18] right and let me not put this in a
[53:21] derogatory way but that's old
[53:24] news
[53:29] we should already be living that
[53:31] GL right now with what word we've got
[53:35] brother Brandon preached to hear people
[53:37] not to
[53:39] hear so that's old news that's stuff
[53:42] that we should be it should be everyday
[53:45] life should be lived and all those
[53:46] virtues
[53:48] working come on right cuz what's he
[53:52] going to cap everybody wants to know
[53:53] what the Capstone Revelation is yes
[53:56] what's he going to cap what's he going
[53:57] to sit on brother BR said you can't have
[54:00] a a Capstone of steel or or of stone and
[54:03] a body of Steel right won't fit you got
[54:06] to have a body of stone and a headstone
[54:09] right all right of stone but now listen
[54:13] and I want us to kind of shake oursel
[54:14] and and realize that Jesus even saying
[54:17] here he said this wasn't for me
[54:20] right it's not for me amen it's for you
[54:24] that's right Glory that's like when he
[54:26] was at the tomb of Lazarus I mean Jesus
[54:28] had already seen the
[54:29] resurrection four days ago right he'
[54:33] already seen a vision that Lazarus was
[54:34] going to raise from the dead cuz he said
[54:35] he sleep right he said he
[54:39] sleepeth but remember he prays out
[54:43] loud and he says this is not for me
[54:46] right this is for you standing around
[54:48] right what to build their faith he
[54:51] didn't need Faith he was Faith amen but
[54:54] you and I you got to come to the place
[54:56] to
[54:57] where these three things of our
[55:01] being which is the body the body it only
[55:05] reacts that's right the body
[55:07] reacts to what's motivated on the inside
[55:11] all
[55:12] right the spirit and I like this I kind
[55:14] of picked this up from brother Aaron and
[55:16] real good brother out there in in Texas
[55:19] but he said the spirit is the character
[55:22] see we're Body Spirit and soul the
[55:24] spirit is the character now to me these
[55:27] are character Builders right right cuz
[55:31] remember in your soul it's either Faith
[55:33] or doubt right there's
[55:37] no
[55:39] actually the soul is already sealed put
[55:43] in Heavenly places done
[55:47] finished if you're born
[55:50] again sitting in Heavenly places right
[55:55] that's where your soul is right but your
[55:58] spirit which is the character of you is
[56:02] what is down here because like I told
[56:05] them before
[56:07] downstairs
[56:09] remember in that Spirit
[56:14] realm there's not a lot to do with
[56:17] future
[56:19] right let's take them for just a minute
[56:22] memory you don't have a memory of what
[56:24] you're doing tomorrow CU you ain't got
[56:27] there yet but you got a memory of what
[56:29] you did in your
[56:30] past reason you reason forward but you
[56:34] reason for what you reason from what you
[56:37] did in the back right right conscience
[56:40] my gosh we know where that comes from
[56:42] it's all back you can't have a conscious
[56:44] see that's why brother Ram said the
[56:46] conscious of a sear is together right
[56:48] subconscious and conscious he can see
[56:50] that way and that way you can only see
[56:52] that way right you don't know what's
[56:55] going to happen
[56:56] tomorrow okay memory reason conscience
[57:00] affection how can you love something and
[57:02] not know what it is right so you're
[57:05] working off your
[57:06] past and Imagination sure you can
[57:09] imagine forward but most time your
[57:10] imagination is what you is built on what
[57:13] you did in the past right so those five
[57:16] senses in that Spirit realm is where
[57:18] we've got to like brother Ernie said we
[57:20] got to do a paradigm shift we got to
[57:23] quit looking at the past
[57:26] cuz you know the Soul's not looking at
[57:28] the past right Faith or doubt
[57:32] exactly you either born again or not now
[57:34] if you're not then you're definitely in
[57:35] the past you're actually like the Frog
[57:37] you turn around you're looking you're
[57:39] looking in your past but you see if
[57:41] you're born again it's Faith or
[57:44] doubt and that's the real you well what
[57:46] it's trying to do is it's trying to move
[57:49] its way
[57:50] out it's trying to make itself become
[57:53] the character of Jesus Jesus Christ
[57:56] because the Son of God is in
[57:58] you if you're born again the Son of God
[58:02] is in
[58:03] you trying to be the son of man yeah oh
[58:07] yeah right cuz now remember Jesus didn't
[58:10] have no flu exactly yep Jesus didn't
[58:15] have the flu stopped up in his Spirit he
[58:17] could move back and forth so that made
[58:20] him the son of man he was the word made
[58:22] flesh and you know what though he had
[58:25] thoughts in his mind just like you do
[58:26] and I
[58:28] do so we can't say well I'm just human
[58:31] and I have these thoughts well Jesus had
[58:32] them too he just said the prince of this
[58:35] world's come and has nothing in me
[58:36] resist the devil and they'll flee from
[58:37] me you know it's so simple things like
[58:39] that but see Jesus didn't have his flu
[58:41] stopped up so he could work he could
[58:43] take that soul and work it
[58:46] out into his spirit and then his body
[58:49] reacted right right you and I have a
[58:52] problem we were born wrong
[58:55] right so we got a lot coming in this
[58:57] direction right remember brother Brown
[58:59] said the flues get stopped up why with
[59:02] what memory reason conscious affection
[59:06] imagination that's where it gets clogged
[59:08] up you say well how can we get rid of
[59:12] it
[59:14] somehow God made a road
[59:17] map for that to
[59:21] happen because that's not the virtue of
[59:23] a man that's the virtue of God
[59:27] right A lot of people have
[59:30] virtue brother Brown said and I didn't
[59:32] bring the quote with brother R and he
[59:33] said there's many people has these
[59:34] virtues but they're they're humanly
[59:38] right um performed I guess you might say
[59:41] just like Brother Richard Wilson said
[59:43] there was a guy at worked there that you
[59:44] could just take his paycheck and rip it
[59:46] up and throw it away or say I'm taking
[59:47] $50 out of your paycheck and he said
[59:48] that's fine it's just some people made
[59:50] like that but when you have the virtue
[59:53] like Peter had the virtue
[59:57] somebody needed something he had the
[59:59] money in the bank right he didn't have
[1:00:02] to go get it or go find it he didn't
[1:00:04] have to go find a quote book yeah that's
[1:00:07] what I'm saying he didn't have to go
[1:00:08] find a quotebook right he didn't he and
[1:00:10] you know he didn't even say Jesus said
[1:00:14] right he said Silver and Gold Have I
[1:00:17] None but such as I
[1:00:19] have that I received on the day of
[1:00:22] Pentecost such as I have I give unto you
[1:00:27] wonder how we going to do
[1:00:30] it it's a position of
[1:00:34] understanding it's a position of
[1:00:36] understanding that's why brother Ram
[1:00:37] said you you know where you at with God
[1:00:39] it's just like I
[1:00:41] said if you don't come to church more
[1:00:43] now than you did 6 months ago you're
[1:00:45] backslid right amen absolutely backslid
[1:00:48] is is a as a almost like a sinner cuz
[1:00:51] the Bible says much more as the day
[1:00:54] approaches right you should be here amen
[1:00:56] and amen I need this that's right this
[1:00:59] ain't just a
[1:01:00] ritual I need a I need can you get your
[1:01:03] fuel out
[1:01:06] there I want somebody to show me what
[1:01:08] job means
[1:01:11] more what mother means more brother
[1:01:15] sister hey when jun's father comes to
[1:01:18] our house he sits at home at my house on
[1:01:20] Sunday by himself or either comes to
[1:01:22] church with us you know what and he
[1:01:24] knows that there's not some surprise
[1:01:26] that comes up and says I got to take
[1:01:28] care of my mom today it's
[1:01:31] Sunday it's preparing ourself right
[1:01:35] because if we don't prepare oursel
[1:01:37] something's going to hit us right it's
[1:01:39] like mom when she was taking care of of
[1:01:41] of Grandpa when he was when he had
[1:01:43] cancer she said hey girls or and son and
[1:01:46] brother I'll stay with him all week but
[1:01:48] somebody's going to stay with him on
[1:01:50] Sunday right right I'm coming to church
[1:01:54] and you know what they cowboyed
[1:01:57] up and you know she got the worst end of
[1:01:59] the deal cuz she was there more than any
[1:02:01] of them but that one day her daddy was
[1:02:06] dying Jesus wasn't just spitting Stones
[1:02:09] when he said forsake father mother
[1:02:12] sister how many times will we all let
[1:02:14] all that get in the way all that stuff
[1:02:17] just mud you know what it does it
[1:02:19] condemns you and when it condemns you it
[1:02:21] stops you from going up that statue of a
[1:02:22] perfect man
[1:02:27] all of
[1:02:29] us see and that's one I me we we we
[1:02:33] glory in the holy spirit that we have
[1:02:35] here don't get me wrong it's the most
[1:02:37] important thing in your life amen
[1:02:40] right but how you act
[1:02:43] afterwards cuz if Deanna she's going to
[1:02:46] be a tall
[1:02:48] girl hey
[1:02:51] baby she's going to be a tall girl but
[1:02:54] you know what if we would have stopped
[1:02:56] feeding her at about 2 years old she'd
[1:02:58] either died or she'd be
[1:03:01] malnutrition or she'd have some kind of
[1:03:03] disease you know how a long time ago
[1:03:05] when that what was it called rickets or
[1:03:07] something that you had rickets because
[1:03:09] of vitamin C right there was no V just
[1:03:11] one one little
[1:03:14] vitamin one little church
[1:03:19] service I'm telling you people we're
[1:03:21] letting other things get in our way but
[1:03:24] yet we want to know about these great
[1:03:26] things but have you had a Mountaintop
[1:03:28] experience yet that's my whole
[1:03:32] point that's if you had a Mountaintop
[1:03:36] experience
[1:03:38] exactly because Jesus had to come to a
[1:03:40] place to where Moses and Elijah had to
[1:03:42] tell him about his second
[1:03:44] coming so don't think you going to get
[1:03:47] by without a Mountaintop experience
[1:03:49] right and then the seals can be open to
[1:03:53] you right then the the the part the
[1:03:56] Living Part like I said and don't get me
[1:03:59] I'm sorry for saying old news but that
[1:04:01] should be it that should have what that
[1:04:03] was what was working in the first church
[1:04:09] age it's like brother Dale said and you
[1:04:11] know you say well brother you're
[1:04:12] preaching does and don'ts and and
[1:04:13] brother Dale's preaching you can do what
[1:04:15] you want to yeah
[1:04:18] absolutely I told the kids one time at a
[1:04:22] youth banquet I said look I said there's
[1:04:24] a law in the books in the state of
[1:04:26] Georgia that if you
[1:04:28] drive on Georgia
[1:04:30] highways and you drink and there's a
[1:04:33] certain like 0.08 that you blow that you
[1:04:36] your alcohol content I said you're going
[1:04:39] to jail right now that laws on the books
[1:04:42] right right but if you never drank a
[1:04:44] drop in your
[1:04:46] life they can put a death penalty on
[1:04:49] that and it'll never bother you you'll
[1:04:52] never get nervous about it
[1:04:54] cuz you don't go there right it's just
[1:04:57] like that Law's not there and that's
[1:04:58] what brother Dell's preaching if you're
[1:05:01] born again some of those
[1:05:03] laws become Grace
[1:05:07] amen those laws become Grace right but
[1:05:10] not greasy Grace where we can just do
[1:05:13] anything we want
[1:05:14] to you do anything you want to then it's
[1:05:17] just like I said it it proves that you
[1:05:19] Haven had an experience
[1:05:21] yet
[1:05:23] okay why can't we and I'm going to hit
[1:05:26] everybody why can't
[1:05:28] we not have any
[1:05:35] deacons we
[1:05:37] shouldn't but God put them in the Bible
[1:05:39] for a reason cuz you knew y'all wouldn't
[1:05:42] do what the pastor
[1:05:47] says even with the Holy Ghost Peter says
[1:05:51] Paul says things hard to understand
[1:05:53] right
[1:05:54] that we wrestle to our own destruction
[1:05:56] because we can't understand what the man
[1:05:57] is talking about but you know what he
[1:05:59] never said Paul was wrong right he just
[1:06:02] said I can't understand what Paul's
[1:06:03] saying at this moment or at this time
[1:06:05] see it's how you approach God but now
[1:06:08] let's read this in First Corinthians
[1:06:12] because we got to come to a position to
[1:06:15] understand yeah the the down payment for
[1:06:19] the house or the down payment for your
[1:06:22] full Redemption
[1:06:25] excuse me was purchased at your new
[1:06:27] birth
[1:06:28] right then you got a payment
[1:06:32] book hadn't had one of them in a long
[1:06:35] time payment book get them things in the
[1:06:38] mail you start getting nervous but you
[1:06:40] know what God give you a payment
[1:06:43] book and he said
[1:06:46] um you pay you get virtue knowledge
[1:06:50] because you're paying for your house
[1:06:53] right what are
[1:06:55] you you're a temple of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:58] right you paying on your house not with
[1:07:04] money but you're paying with
[1:07:09] character because remember now brother
[1:07:11] Bram said
[1:07:13] power without
[1:07:15] character right and I think that's
[1:07:18] what's the problem
[1:07:20] right we got power without character
[1:07:23] right
[1:07:24] like I said we got a we got a knowledge
[1:07:27] on a
[1:07:30] revelation cuz if we had a revelation on
[1:07:32] the Revelation that's power with
[1:07:35] character right he said is what fit to
[1:07:38] rule rule what this guy it's not fit to
[1:07:42] Ru Donnie F Bush I I'm not that's not my
[1:07:44] that's not my
[1:07:46] property that's his property right
[1:07:49] that's you know what brother Brown said
[1:07:50] this is my eye my eye God gave it to me
[1:07:53] amen okay this is my
[1:07:54] body God gave it to me right who else
[1:07:57] gave it to you God gave it to you all
[1:08:00] right so that's what we got to be
[1:08:01] looking we got to see that that here in
[1:08:04] First Corinthians says what know you not
[1:08:06] that your body is the Temple of the Holy
[1:08:09] Ghost which is in you which you have of
[1:08:12] God and ye are not your own right for
[1:08:16] you are bought with a price right bought
[1:08:19] with a price
[1:08:21] comma therefore
[1:08:24] glorify God in your body and in your
[1:08:29] spirit amen which are
[1:08:31] gods that doesn't say anything about the
[1:08:33] soul because it's already got your soul
[1:08:34] if you're bought if you're bought if you
[1:08:35] have a temple of the Holy Ghost all
[1:08:37] right talking about your body talking
[1:08:40] about your spirit or your character
[1:08:42] remember from now on when somebody says
[1:08:44] Spirit or talks about because see that's
[1:08:46] the spirit that dwells in man that's the
[1:08:48] character of man all right and brother
[1:08:50] brandham the the prophet of God brought
[1:08:52] it out from p Peter and said hey we got
[1:08:55] to do this before God can do other
[1:08:58] things for us all right so that's why
[1:09:00] that that
[1:09:03] power without
[1:09:06] character right is satanic right you can
[1:09:10] sit right here and be full of the
[1:09:12] devil but when you have a revelation
[1:09:15] from God Satan cannot get a revelation
[1:09:18] from God Amen he can get a knowledge on
[1:09:21] the Revelation is't that what the
[1:09:22] prophet said that's what I'm getting
[1:09:23] back to so you see what the knowledge of
[1:09:26] the Revelation does to
[1:09:28] you makes you just like I said before he
[1:09:31] High minded lovers of pleasure more than
[1:09:33] lovers of
[1:09:36] God from such turn away
[1:09:40] right I don't hear any amens on that one
[1:09:45] amen but why are we still here we'll
[1:09:47] still he because I can't get in
[1:09:50] line I'm not worried about y'all I'm
[1:09:52] still here cuz I can't get life that's
[1:09:56] right but what do we do about
[1:09:59] it come on what we do about it it's like
[1:10:03] Dad said Sunday we had a church full
[1:10:06] Sunday there was nobody here I know it
[1:10:09] was a Memorial Day weekend but I know
[1:10:12] what some of y'all were
[1:10:17] doing don't have to have a lot of
[1:10:19] discernment when people run their
[1:10:22] mouth
[1:10:24] just sit and listen just sit and listen
[1:10:26] that's all you got to do got do just sit
[1:10:28] and
[1:10:31] listen but I want to know one thing
[1:10:33] that's more important than being right
[1:10:36] here I want to know it if it is we'll
[1:10:39] Sunday we'll go there there's nothing
[1:10:42] more important than being right here
[1:10:44] being on time being in service like I
[1:10:46] told him downstairs I said the only
[1:10:49] people that hear that buzzer downstairs
[1:10:50] is the
[1:10:52] goats the Sheep never hear it right
[1:10:55] they're either in Sunday school or up
[1:10:57] here sorry brother Dale said 15 minutes
[1:11:01] before service you need to be up here
[1:11:02] not downstairs yaking that's not me I'm
[1:11:04] just here to enforce what he said so
[1:11:06] it's not my rule it's what I said about
[1:11:08] deacons everybody thinks deacons has
[1:11:11] their own rules and it's not the pastors
[1:11:13] no brother Brown said if the pastor and
[1:11:15] the Deacon are not together you need to
[1:11:17] get rid of the deacon right in the way
[1:11:19] that get rid of the deacon right so
[1:11:22] maybe we'll see a few things change
[1:11:24] around here we'll see but we got to have
[1:11:27] a clean house if you're sitting in this
[1:11:29] room tonight and you're committing
[1:11:30] adultery you're hindering this whole
[1:11:33] church if you're sitting in this house
[1:11:35] tonight and you don't have your kids
[1:11:38] lined up me included and they live with
[1:11:43] you if you're sitting here tonight and
[1:11:45] you're not the head of your house you're
[1:11:48] hindering this
[1:11:52] church
[1:11:57] prove me
[1:11:59] wrong that's what the word
[1:12:03] says that's what the word we're going to
[1:12:05] get back to just what the word says
[1:12:06] don't this is just a filter tonight this
[1:12:09] is a filter I'm telling you what the
[1:12:10] word says I'm not telling you what my
[1:12:12] ideas this is what the word
[1:12:15] says
[1:12:17] right some of you take communion and you
[1:12:21] show up two or three times every two or
[1:12:23] three months
[1:12:24] and don't do fit washing and hey we got
[1:12:28] three ordinances that are commanded by
[1:12:31] God
[1:12:32] today
[1:12:35] right three ordinances commanded by God
[1:12:38] today and what do we do with
[1:12:40] them but a position to understand that's
[1:12:43] what I want trying to get the Sunday
[1:12:44] school class to see now that for God to
[1:12:48] be able to to use us we got to make
[1:12:52] oursel available for it right we've got
[1:12:55] to make oursel to where and we're going
[1:12:57] to read it Go aad and pull that next to
[1:12:59] the last
[1:13:01] quote this guy right here is the same
[1:13:04] guy down here
[1:13:05] amen it's just more of
[1:13:08] him to me this this is what I call this
[1:13:11] is usable Holy
[1:13:13] Spirit you not say well no no this is
[1:13:16] usable but it's the earnest right it's
[1:13:19] just one down payment
[1:13:23] all right this
[1:13:25] is the
[1:13:28] full let's read this quote here this is
[1:13:31] at the end of Statute of a perfect man
[1:13:32] brother Bram said did you ever hear this
[1:13:34] now let me tell you this and keep real
[1:13:36] put this in your listening ear see a
[1:13:38] chain is it strongest at its weakest
[1:13:41] length that's right it's no stronger
[1:13:44] than its weakest length does everybody
[1:13:45] understand what that is right you can
[1:13:47] have a chain that'll hold 2,000 lb 2,000
[1:13:50] lb 2,000 lb 2,000 lb500 lb 2 ,000 lb
[1:13:53] 2,000 lb 2,000 lb 2,000 lb where's it
[1:13:56] going to
[1:13:57] break at about 1,600 lb this one's going
[1:14:00] to
[1:14:01] break so your Chain's no good right your
[1:14:04] chain becomes useless after that right
[1:14:07] all right that's what he's saying you
[1:14:09] this it's so it's no stronger than his
[1:14:12] weakest length no matter how strong now
[1:14:15] listen to this he's talking about the
[1:14:16] virtues no matter how strong these are
[1:14:19] built up this is built up if it's got a
[1:14:22] weak length there where she breaks and
[1:14:25] it's no stronger than the weakest length
[1:14:26] brother Brown refers to the chalkboard
[1:14:28] drawing now if you possess you say you
[1:14:32] see he said you say you say you got this
[1:14:35] this this you don't have this there's
[1:14:36] where she breaks right if you got this
[1:14:39] and haven't got that she'll break right
[1:14:41] there you got this and haven't got that
[1:14:43] it'll break this and haven't got this
[1:14:45] it'll break this and haven't got this
[1:14:46] it'll break I think he's going up the
[1:14:47] statue of a perfect man and you ain't
[1:14:49] can't have this without having this so
[1:14:52] when you surrender your complete
[1:14:55] being look what he says so when you
[1:14:57] surrender your complete being then the
[1:14:59] Holy Spirit
[1:15:01] then then the Holy Spirit just pours
[1:15:05] through you in these virtues then you're
[1:15:09] a living
[1:15:11] Tabernacle
[1:15:15] then you read that he says then then
[1:15:19] people look out and say that's a man
[1:15:20] full of virtue and knowledge he believes
[1:15:22] the word tempers patience God his
[1:15:23] brotherly kindness full of the love of
[1:15:24] the Holy Ghost see there he is walking
[1:15:26] around what is it a stature that
[1:15:29] unbelievers can look at and say there is
[1:15:32] a Christian there is a man or woman who
[1:15:35] knows what they're
[1:15:37] talking
[1:15:39] about you never seen a Kinder sweeter
[1:15:43] godlier
[1:15:46] person I'll let that soak in a little
[1:15:50] bit you've never seen a Kinder sweeter
[1:15:52] Godly person you're sealed a seal shows
[1:15:55] on both sides see to me a seal shows on
[1:15:58] both sides like brother Claude said you
[1:16:00] got one side here one side at home
[1:16:05] yeah and if it ain't the
[1:16:09] same look how confusing it is right what
[1:16:13] gets me more than
[1:16:16] anything is for y'all y'all me included
[1:16:19] but now the kids can't say I don't come
[1:16:21] to church but for y'all to come and say
[1:16:22] oh God my kids out in the world my kids
[1:16:24] doing this my kids doing that my kids
[1:16:26] doing this my kids doing that then you
[1:16:28] don't come to church half
[1:16:31] time I don't I don't get where you don't
[1:16:34] get that right I don't get it amen how
[1:16:37] many times is brother Dale said maybe
[1:16:39] they're not here because of you right oh
[1:16:42] everybody's quiet
[1:16:47] now but I wanted what that man had I
[1:16:52] don't want his experience but I wanted
[1:16:55] the character that that man
[1:16:58] had that's what makes me who I am daddy
[1:17:02] or no
[1:17:03] Daddy I pick out that character and
[1:17:05] that's what I want to be like now do
[1:17:07] your kids say the same about
[1:17:11] you are you sitting at home with them
[1:17:14] watching television on Sunday and and
[1:17:16] then you come up here and cry and want
[1:17:17] brother Dale to save your
[1:17:19] kids maybe you ought to start saving
[1:17:21] them right right
[1:17:25] is coming from you
[1:17:26] first maybe you ought to try saving them
[1:17:29] get their haircut and make them live
[1:17:30] right if somebody lives if my kids live
[1:17:32] in my house they're going to do right
[1:17:34] right Josh I told you that's why he
[1:17:40] left a seal a seal shows on both sides
[1:17:44] whether you're going or coming you see
[1:17:48] the seal the same right it's not
[1:17:51] different all right
[1:17:53] there you are see when a man or woman
[1:17:55] possesses this not just thinks they have
[1:17:58] it possesses this then the Capstone
[1:18:02] then what's the Capstone the seals then
[1:18:05] the seals can be revealed right then the
[1:18:09] Capstone comes down and seals them into
[1:18:12] the kingdom of God which is the Holy
[1:18:14] Ghost right that's when it comes
[1:18:17] down that's when you get the
[1:18:21] revelation of the cap
[1:18:23] Stone which is love last
[1:18:27] quote well I got two more but they're
[1:18:33] together then Peter Still statue of a
[1:18:35] perfect man then Peter here says first
[1:18:37] seven
[1:18:38] things Faith virtue seek coming up
[1:18:40] knowledge Temperance patience godl
[1:18:42] brotherly kindness add brotherly
[1:18:43] kindness and then the love of God the
[1:18:45] Holy Ghost Christ in the person of the
[1:18:48] Holy Ghost come upon you comes upon you
[1:18:51] in the true baptism
[1:18:54] not that the other one's false remember
[1:18:56] the Bible says the faithful and true
[1:18:58] witness Jesus so that doesn't mean he
[1:19:00] was false now he's true no that's what
[1:19:03] this is in the true baptism of the Holy
[1:19:06] Ghost see that's where brother Ram had
[1:19:08] to come to to the true baptism of the
[1:19:10] Holy Ghost before he went on that
[1:19:12] mountain and God said this is my beloved
[1:19:14] Son hear ye him he had to come to that
[1:19:17] first and you think you and I are going
[1:19:19] to make it be any
[1:19:20] different I don't think so
[1:19:23] the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:19:25] you got all these virtues sealed in you
[1:19:29] then God lives in a tabernacle called
[1:19:32] the building the living Tabernacle of
[1:19:34] the living God's dwelling place right
[1:19:38] last
[1:19:40] one Statue of a perfect
[1:19:43] man right in here right in here you see
[1:19:46] I got in between all these Works in here
[1:19:49] and here these little waves now they
[1:19:50] didn't put the waves on here but I saw
[1:19:52] one I don't know if if you got it or not
[1:19:53] somebody's got one where brother Brandon
[1:19:55] put waves they come down like this I've
[1:19:59] seen it one time before but that's what
[1:20:01] he's talking about cuz what he's talking
[1:20:03] about you you get this this and this and
[1:20:04] if there's a crack here something's
[1:20:06] something's going to go wrong you got to
[1:20:08] go back and fill that crack up all right
[1:20:10] but what this whole what this does is
[1:20:11] this seals didn't know what he just said
[1:20:14] it seals these
[1:20:16] in got it amen so I'll glorify it cuz
[1:20:22] you are my son
[1:20:23] right amen you're my son if you're born
[1:20:26] again you're my son you're my child
[1:20:29] child but like brother dick says I want
[1:20:32] to marry a wife not a
[1:20:34] child his wife has made herself ready
[1:20:38] all right right in here right in here
[1:20:39] you see I got in between all these Works
[1:20:41] in here and here these little waves come
[1:20:43] what is it the holy ghost coming down
[1:20:45] through Christ see the Holy Spirit see
[1:20:47] holy
[1:20:48] spirit all right so it's got to come
[1:20:50] through Christ into you cuz this Christ
[1:20:53] in you the hope of glory the holy spirit
[1:20:55] is above all this welding this
[1:20:59] together right building a what a perfect
[1:21:03] church for the Capstone to cap it
[1:21:10] off what's it been done
[1:21:13] again it's manifested through seven
[1:21:15] Church ages and seven Church Messengers
[1:21:18] so he's telling you that it come down
[1:21:20] through the church ages and The
[1:21:23] Messengers but remember the Capstone was
[1:21:26] lost the Capstone Revelation was
[1:21:30] lost right Jesus was the Capstone right
[1:21:34] Jesus was the seals amen he was the
[1:21:37] whole he was the whole thing but he had
[1:21:40] to come to a place to where
[1:21:42] God could use that
[1:21:45] vessel so how are you and I going to get
[1:21:47] away with it brother bandam couldn't get
[1:21:48] away with it Paul Peter all they
[1:21:51] couldn't get away with the virtues work
[1:21:52] working in their life they couldn't get
[1:21:53] away from
[1:21:56] that you say well I'm I'm I'm just
[1:22:01] malnourished well come to church right
[1:22:05] do the things right pay your tithe pay
[1:22:07] your tithe right would you yeah thank
[1:22:10] you you heard the pastor say right pay
[1:22:13] your tithe right not just give what you
[1:22:15] think you ought to
[1:22:19] give but you know what God doesn't need
[1:22:21] your money right but he wants you to be
[1:22:23] a
[1:22:24] giver he wants you to be a giver he
[1:22:26] wants you to give that one more thing
[1:22:28] before we
[1:22:31] go the seals is the Capstone revelation
[1:22:34] of the whole thing amen right we know
[1:22:37] that but it's the Capstone revelation of
[1:22:38] the whole
[1:22:39] thing and it's going to
[1:22:43] come
[1:22:45] here on a person that has all these
[1:22:48] working in their life right it's not
[1:22:51] going to come down in half of the this
[1:22:52] is here and and you know what this don't
[1:22:54] fit down
[1:22:58] here cuz if you keep reading on a little
[1:23:00] bit further brother BR says it's a razor
[1:23:03] honed Edge and actually the Capstone has
[1:23:06] got a flange or a little lip on it right
[1:23:09] right you know how to get that lip you
[1:23:11] got to hone something yeah you got to
[1:23:13] hone it down so that lip will fit over
[1:23:15] it and then when that lip fits over it
[1:23:17] guess what it does it seals the whole
[1:23:19] thing in
[1:23:21] amen but my question tonight what's it
[1:23:25] sealing
[1:23:25] in right that's my question to
[1:23:29] you are we just going to be satisfied
[1:23:32] with the Son of God Revelation that
[1:23:33] we're born again and that we're children
[1:23:34] of God and that we're going to heaven
[1:23:36] and and
[1:23:38] uh that we're going to have a little
[1:23:40] problems down here but uh one of these
[1:23:43] days one of these days God's just going
[1:23:45] to uh like sister Anna marunga she she
[1:23:49] uh kind of was a little taken back and
[1:23:51] uh when I told told him that uh God's
[1:23:54] not coming on any certain
[1:23:56] day God don't have a day on the calendar
[1:23:58] and that he just said I'm coming right
[1:24:00] here December the 15th I'm just I'm
[1:24:02] coming whether no he's coming when he
[1:24:05] sees all of us get ready
[1:24:08] right so so there's not a day where he
[1:24:10] just you know we reading the Bible and
[1:24:11] they said he come as a thief in the
[1:24:13] night and he come this you know oh that
[1:24:15] God's got a day he's coming you know the
[1:24:16] day of the Lord he's coming no he's
[1:24:18] coming when you and I are ready but he
[1:24:19] knows that day we
[1:24:21] don't but he's not coming until his
[1:24:23] children are ready are two things are
[1:24:25] going to have to
[1:24:28] happen you're e you're either got not
[1:24:30] going to yield yourself completely to
[1:24:31] God and you're going to go by the grave
[1:24:33] remember I preached on the
[1:24:34] purging cuz you're going to be purged
[1:24:36] one way or the other death is either
[1:24:39] going to purge the old
[1:24:41] man or we're going to have it purged
[1:24:44] while we're still
[1:24:45] alive by the Capstone Revelation because
[1:24:48] you know what Jesus went through a
[1:24:51] purging time right
[1:24:53] Jesus went through death so you and I
[1:24:54] don't have to go through death amen but
[1:24:56] you know what there's a lot of there's a
[1:24:58] lot of things
[1:25:01] between here and
[1:25:04] here but the Bible says those who he has
[1:25:08] Justified he has
[1:25:10] already glorified amen now boy there
[1:25:13] that's a big that's a you could break
[1:25:16] that down and you say oh oh well that
[1:25:17] don't mean that means I don't have to do
[1:25:18] nothing yeah if you're born again you're
[1:25:20] going to die and you're going to come up
[1:25:22] Justified but you're going to have to
[1:25:23] die right anybody like that word die I
[1:25:28] don't like
[1:25:30] it but there's a chance that says we
[1:25:33] which are alive and remain we which have
[1:25:36] come who have come to a possession
[1:25:38] that's what Paul was saying right we who
[1:25:39] have come to a
[1:25:41] position we're going to be
[1:25:43] changed when the full stature of that
[1:25:46] man is standing
[1:25:48] there and God can say I've both glor
[1:25:52] glorified it when you started right and
[1:25:55] I'm going to glorify glorify it at the
[1:25:57] end am and in between is a character
[1:26:00] builder right in between as brother
[1:26:03] Keith Reed says that's Trials of
[1:26:06] life and remember whoever you let
[1:26:10] win is the one you feed the most let's
[1:26:13] stand glorify it again
[1:26:19] Lord can we shake oursel amen
[1:26:26] that if Jesus went through all
[1:26:28] that you and I are going to go through
[1:26:30] all that too
[1:26:32] amen all
[1:26:34] right father glorify thy
[1:26:37] name right he said I have both glorified
[1:26:40] it and will glorify it again right and
[1:26:45] if we take on the name Miss Jesus Christ
[1:26:48] Brother Gary he promised he'll glorify
[1:26:49] it again
[1:26:51] amen we're the only people that have the
[1:26:54] full revelation of the word I I don't
[1:26:56] that doesn't hit
[1:26:57] home if it hit
[1:26:59] home we might start shouting a little
[1:27:01] bit
[1:27:03] right cuz we are the only one brother
[1:27:06] Dane we're the only ones the only
[1:27:09] ones I I you know I was uh cutting grass
[1:27:12] at a church today and and I was telling
[1:27:14] somebody the other day there's some old
[1:27:16] Graves back in the 1800s 1889 one man
[1:27:19] died and I thought you know and I was
[1:27:21] sitting there weed eating over the grave
[1:27:23] and I I was just kind of in my spirit I
[1:27:27] said I
[1:27:29] wonder I wonder sure if I'm standing
[1:27:32] over a born again
[1:27:35] Christian yeah
[1:27:37] probably but in I you know am I standing
[1:27:40] I mean in the 1800s they don't but they
[1:27:42] what I was thinking was I thought God
[1:27:44] they never heard of a
[1:27:46] Prophet come
[1:27:49] on that's right well that's what I mean
[1:27:52] I thought Lord how many of these people
[1:27:53] are born again that's going to come up
[1:27:54] in the first resurrection that never
[1:27:56] heard a word about William
[1:27:59] brandom they knew about Jesus Christ for
[1:28:02] their day they had the word for their
[1:28:05] day and I just looked around and I saw
[1:28:06] all these families and and young kids
[1:28:09] and older ones and I you know I'm just
[1:28:12] that's just me and I'm wondering and I
[1:28:14] thought of brother dick I thought I
[1:28:15] wonder if any of these there Old Farmers
[1:28:17] way out in this church is way out in
[1:28:18] sticks I thought what some them may have
[1:28:20] on overalls you know you I don't know
[1:28:23] but back then it really didn't matter
[1:28:26] but remember what I was thinking of is
[1:28:28] they had God right sure it was a Baptist
[1:28:32] that didn't mean a thing to me before I
[1:28:33] was standing that didn't mean a thing to
[1:28:35] me
[1:28:37] 1889 there wasn't a thing called the
[1:28:39] message there actually wasn't a thing
[1:28:41] called
[1:28:41] Pentecost right so what did they
[1:28:46] have right but you know when they
[1:28:49] resurrect Jesus is going to be just as
[1:28:51] his pleased with them right just as
[1:28:55] pleased with them amen as he is with us
[1:28:58] but you know what here's the
[1:29:01] problem they can't get
[1:29:03] up without
[1:29:05] us that's right exactly that's
[1:29:08] right and that's what I was thinking
[1:29:10] brother dick walking over them Graves I
[1:29:12] thought I'm keeping these people that
[1:29:14] are born again I'm keeping these people
[1:29:17] sure I know their soul somewhere else
[1:29:19] but I'm keeping these people from taking
[1:29:21] a body chain amen because of my actions
[1:29:24] and my reactions that's what I want to
[1:29:25] think about let's sing a song 2 260 he
[1:29:29] hideth my
[1:29:30] soul let's worship him just for a little
[1:29:34] while oh wonderful saor is Jesus my Lord

[1:34:20] covered
[1:34:22] me there with
[1:34:25] his and he covers me there with his hand
[1:34:31] you know we were in um I told you what
[1:34:33] happened at the motel in in New Jersey
[1:34:36] and um we were in service uh that Friday
[1:34:40] night and and we had a couple people
[1:34:42] come up for prayer and and the the
[1:34:45] church is a little Pentecostal they're
[1:34:46] they're coming out of Pentecost trying
[1:34:47] to come into the message and and you
[1:34:49] know Pentecost they have to reach and
[1:34:51] grab you and slap you and throw wall all
[1:34:53] over you and you know do this and scream
[1:34:55] and shout well I told him I said brother
[1:34:58] he walked up and he he's walking you
[1:34:59] know like this walking like this and I
[1:35:02] stepped down and I said brother I said
[1:35:04] Do you believe what God said he said I
[1:35:07] do I said well the Bible says lay hands
[1:35:09] on the sick and they shall recover
[1:35:11] didn't say a thing about praying and I
[1:35:13] just reached and touched that brother on
[1:35:14] the shoulder and I said go sit down do
[1:35:16] you know what it shocked him so much he
[1:35:17] stood
[1:35:20] there cuz the prayer line we had the
[1:35:22] next night was the Pentecostal shaking
[1:35:25] and throwing and spitting and all that
[1:35:28] stuff and that's
[1:35:29] fine but can it just be an emotion the
[1:35:32] Bible didn't say that the Bible said
[1:35:33] just lay the hands on the sick and they
[1:35:34] sh it don't say pray Jerk It just said
[1:35:37] lay hands on the sick and brother Tim
[1:35:39] prayed for the same guy the next night I
[1:35:41] just don't believe he had the faith to
[1:35:44] believe what I said sorry if he was here
[1:35:47] I'd tell him cuz he's a a dear precious
[1:35:49] brother but he just couldn't get by that
[1:35:53] part of somebody trying to shake them
[1:35:55] and you know and that's okay but that's
[1:35:57] an emotion that's a
[1:35:59] workup Bible says lay hands on the seat
[1:36:01] you look at brother
[1:36:02] brandham well look at Jesus Jesus didn't
[1:36:05] scream at the Devil he
[1:36:07] said see you he said
[1:36:10] leave leave just go on
[1:36:13] leave Lazarus come forth right sure he
[1:36:17] cried with a loud voice and that's okay
[1:36:19] I believe he loved Lazarus I believe
[1:36:20] Lazarus had connection with
[1:36:22] Jesus but Jar's daughter all he done he
[1:36:25] the Bible say he just reached down got
[1:36:26] her hand by strapped your heel grabbed
[1:36:30] the hand and what just raised her from
[1:36:31] the dead he didn't have to shake her
[1:36:33] right he didn't have to work it up and
[1:36:35] that's okay but see they come through
[1:36:37] Pentecost and that's what they were
[1:36:38] looking for and I thought man get out of
[1:36:42] that try to get out of that mold of just
[1:36:45] work up and because you know what he the
[1:36:47] next night he was prayed for and they
[1:36:49] you know um brother Tim and brother Bill
[1:36:52] and him they were praying for him you
[1:36:53] know and some of the others gathered
[1:36:54] around they were you know shaking him
[1:36:56] and speaking in tongues and all that you
[1:36:58] know and that's okay that's fine but the
[1:37:00] next day the guys were still walking on
[1:37:02] the
[1:37:03] cane but if he would have just
[1:37:06] believe lay hands on the sick that's it
[1:37:09] and they shall recover right Centurion
[1:37:13] said don't even touch
[1:37:16] nothing you just speak
[1:37:19] it and whatever you
[1:37:23] say whatever you say right that's why
[1:37:26] Jesus was that
[1:37:28] character Jesus didn't have to go pray
[1:37:31] right no he didn't have to go pray did
[1:37:33] he ever when I remember when I said
[1:37:36] about Lazarus though he's prayed at L's
[1:37:38] tomb but he said this is not for me this
[1:37:39] is for y'all right a faith builder for
[1:37:41] you not for me it's telling you what I'm
[1:37:43] fixing to
[1:37:44] do but you know you say well we're we're
[1:37:47] just him we I thought we were supposed
[1:37:50] to be like Jesus amen I thought we're
[1:37:53] supposed to be like him I thought we
[1:37:54] were supposed to walk through life and
[1:37:56] not be anything important not be
[1:37:58] anything you know just live a good
[1:37:59] Christian Life That's what I said old
[1:38:01] news people this should be old news we
[1:38:04] should
[1:38:06] be speaking of the seals and a
[1:38:08] revelation of our own faith we should be
[1:38:10] speaking we should been 50 years since
[1:38:12] the prophet preached it but these
[1:38:14] virtues were alive in a group of people
[1:38:17] that never heard of William brandham
[1:38:20] right
[1:38:22] and really a lot of them never heard of
[1:38:23] the Bible a lot of them wrote it but it
[1:38:26] wasn't compiled together as a Bible it
[1:38:28] was this one wrote here and this one
[1:38:29] wrote over here James wrote over here
[1:38:30] and John wrote over here and then
[1:38:32] somebody put it together afterwards so
[1:38:34] they really weren't going I have faith
[1:38:36] in this part this this this and this no
[1:38:39] they had faith in what they

[1:42:02] them out of the ground let's bow our
[1:42:03] heads dear heavenly father we pray Lord
[1:42:06] tonight that something's been said Lord
[1:42:08] that'll help the
[1:42:09] people nothing's ever done Lord and just
[1:42:13] for chance it always has a meaning and a
[1:42:17] and a word behind it Lord and as we all
[1:42:20] have our heads bowed Lord from the
[1:42:23] ground that we came from we we know that
[1:42:26] we still are in these human
[1:42:29] bodies and we still have things in our
[1:42:33] in our human life that we have to deal
[1:42:35] with because of the
[1:42:36] fall and Lord Jesus our brother's laying
[1:42:39] up there in Tennessee in a
[1:42:43] hospital the devil has slipped one up on
[1:42:46] him and made his
[1:42:48] body reject something or create
[1:42:52] something that's not in there well
[1:42:53] father you're the
[1:42:55] Creator Hallelujah you're the
[1:42:58] Creator Satan is just a
[1:43:01] perverter you created all
[1:43:04] things you created that
[1:43:07] body and Lord now that body according to
[1:43:11] your word has to come under subjection
[1:43:13] to the word of
[1:43:14] God and we pray now as we pray over this
[1:43:18] prayer cloth that Lord when it touches
[1:43:20] our brother's body that he'll be made
[1:43:23] whole and there'll be a testimony Lord
[1:43:26] we still believe in you father dear
[1:43:29] Jesus forgive us of our sins or any
[1:43:31] thoughts or ideas or words that we have
[1:43:33] that we've said or spoken that are that
[1:43:36] are that are off color or bad or or or
[1:43:40] against someone father just cleanse us
[1:43:43] count that to our stupidity and our
[1:43:45] Humanity but Lord we come Lord with the
[1:43:47] blood of Jesus Christ we come with the
[1:43:50] power that you gave us at Calvary Lord
[1:43:54] when you resurrected that body that body
[1:43:56] was laying there dead and cold even a
[1:43:59] body called Lazarus that was already
[1:44:02] Lord Jesus it was stinking already that
[1:44:05] broke down and the cells were beginning
[1:44:08] to rot and father when you stood there
[1:44:10] and said Lazarus come
[1:44:13] forth creation met its
[1:44:16] creator and now Lord you've come back in
[1:44:19] the end time amen in the fullness of the
[1:44:22] word of God and through the prophet said
[1:44:23] through the full full baptism of the
[1:44:26] Holy Ghost where there's power in the
[1:44:29] blood there's power in the people and
[1:44:32] Lord don't let our power be satanic let
[1:44:36] our power have character behind it from
[1:44:39] this point forward Lord let our
[1:44:41] character show and let it show Lord for
[1:44:44] our brother that's laying there Lord
[1:44:46] that his body
[1:44:48] is not usable at this moment Lord but we
[1:44:52] know that our brother's there in his
[1:44:54] spirit and his soul and I know that he's
[1:44:56] wanting us to pray for him he's
[1:44:58] expecting prayers to come from the
[1:45:00] Saints of almighty God and Lord we've
[1:45:03] seen you do many things and we expect
[1:45:06] one more time Lord that you'll come on
[1:45:08] the scene for our brother Lord distance
[1:45:11] doesn't make any difference to you Lord
[1:45:13] but when we take that prayer cloth up
[1:45:15] there to see our precious brother Lord
[1:45:17] see him face to face Lord I pray that
[1:45:19] you'll do a work
[1:45:21] I pray that the people in this building
[1:45:23] Lord will have faith and and it'll come
[1:45:26] on their mind Lord many times during the
[1:45:28] day how our Prophet said many times we
[1:45:31] had brothers that he was quoting that
[1:45:35] maybe we didn't care much
[1:45:37] for didn't have a lot
[1:45:40] of to do with but he said when that
[1:45:43] brother gets sick or you found out that

[1:46:06] anymore you've give us the full
[1:46:08] possession and somebody's going to have
[1:46:10] to stand on this Earth with that full
[1:46:12] possession to bring those wonderful
