«  E-41       †        Galatians the 4th chapter first 1 to 5 verses, gives a beautiful picture of it, how that we were under the tutors so on.
But now, when this child was born he became a son, the very moment he was born in the family. You get it? Now, then there was a tutor over this boy, to educate him and to raise him up. Well, he was no more than a servant, said the Galatian letter, until he came to a age, a certain limited time that was set. And this tutor would always take the father word, "Your son is progressing right," or whatever it was. And now, that's where... I--I'm not disagreeing, my dear brother. But here take it as from one who loves you.
«  E-42       †        There's where Pentecost failed to see this. See? If the Holy Spirit, maybe, not willing to give it then. Look, when you were borned again of the Holy Ghost, you said, "This is It, brother."
It was; you was a child. You was just as much child as you ever could be; you were born in the family. But yet, the Tutor, which is the Holy Spirit, has watched over the church as it's been maturing.
«  E-43       †        Now, if this tutor in the natural went to the father and said, "Now, here, that boy is not going to be very good. I try to teach him; he--he just won't listen. He's got his own headstrong way and he just won't listen. He's going to be this, or he's going to be that."
The father realizes right then, that that boy cannot take over his domain. That's right. Because what would he do? He'd run it through... The return of the prodigal son gives a very beautiful picture of it. See? He could not. What he would do would be mortgage the farm, or sell it off, and drink it up, and run around.
«  E-44       †        Now, in the spiritual sense after we were born into Christ, we become children of God. But then see, God knows best. Now, here's where I say, reverently, disagree with my latter-rain brethren. You think I'm persecuting church...

we've been reading we'll go to verse 22 and 23 a first Peter seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again something's taking place it's in a changing period of things not not off corruptible seed now what's the point being born again not of corruptible it's not something that's corruptible its incorruptible it's the Word of God alright now that's what the scripture says so then we know what the new birth is what the birth of the word right because it's the only thing that's incorruptible now the alive word is what you're talking about you know I talking about dead letter dead letters on the page is corruptible just like anything else you know like that but but revealed word is where we're at which liveth and abideth forever okay now let's go over to if we can get to it tonight and pick up our thought from Galatians 4 what we're going to try to do tonight is as much as possible try to tie together I mentioned it coming through in the series that we've been on but I want you to think about Peter in second Peter talking about the virtues the divine nature of God the things like that explaining that that was what we need to grow into Paul takes it from the adoption of situation are the explaining it from a child being born and growing up all right but both of them are explaining the same thing which is the growth development of a Christian all right now that's that's our thought so get that in your mind and then you can read the Bible and see you can read Peter and say hey I can see that that's that's a growth development then you turn over and Paul and go into wages in Romans you can see it through the eye you see it through all specialty relations and Ephesians that you can see the growth growth development of a Christian and that's what we're talking about right all right now so look what he says verse 1 now I say that the heir as long he isn't as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all know what he's under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the Father even so we now he's this is the natural story as we'll get to it in a minute what a child when it's born into the family it's just as much as house it'll ever be he doesn't become a adoption is not your birth adoption is your placing in your birth all right so then that's what he's saying now he comes from the natural story and he said even so we when we were children in bondage under the elements of the world he's not talking about the natural I'll go back through this to me he's not talking about the natural life he's talking about the spiritual right but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law what far why or what far to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because your sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father wherefore there are no more a servant you're not just a servant now but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ Jesus amen you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word okay father's day sheets sign up downstairs on the refrigerator if you're going to the Father's Day outing let us know where we can have ever nothing and make sure we get enough food and etc and all looking forward to a good time to where it would be more of of inward it won't be having to fight the bugs and the snakes and the and the what do you the thing that they were hunting that the things they were hunting up there you remember Bigfoot it was no joke we came back you thought was telling a joke but I mean they had people from all over the United States looking for Bigfoot we tried our best to tell them he was with us and Aaron was there with us but they were an Anderson and you know he fit in that category that we had Bigfoot but they wouldn't that wouldn't exactly what now I'm talking right now see you life at these things we did but I mean when you see cars drive by this Michigan New York Washington and come to find out there was a group of above us that was in an area that they had rented to where they could camp and research these things all right now listen it cost us twelve dollars and nine that's what we pay for a not at that camping area all right that's one campsite there's twelve dollars they were paying $400 per campsite and I know they had five or six up her but they were playing four hundred dollars because the government would not allow them to come in and look for Bigfoot without paying the big prize they they the Bigfoot okay buddy I might we'll find out we don't get no Bigfoot up there and we'll be sitting inside of teepees you know in having a good time okay now so I thought tonight we want to get into it we've been covering the statue of a perfect man from second Peter all right and we've covered that up to the bases and if you'll if you've noticed it we got just to the new birth and we stopped we mentioned the virtue and you know but now we've dropped over from taking the point of the statue of a perfect man from Peter now we're going to Paul and his account of the Christian development and he's going to approach it from the adoption or situation alright so then all of your your router's Peter Peter and Paul is a basic Paul we know wrote most of them but Peter put it in our telling us about the things of Christianity and how to become to the place of a statue of a perfect man all right now and what he was doing he was telling it as what was our point what has been the point through the statue of perfect man the statue of a perfect man that the second Peter is not written to the world it's written to those that are in Christ Jesus I tried to get you to see then really the entire Bible is written to the Christian the sinner he can only realize he's a sinner from that word of God being brought and talk to him about it it's written to those that are in Christ Jesus and then the Bible says no man can call Jesus the Christ right and said except it be by the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth all right so then the Bible is written to Christians and Peter was telling them how to become partakers of the divine nature remember that in Peter the divine nature which is the nature of Almighty God we're going to get to this is--we're maybe Sunday but see those virtues are a protector of his nature that's why we wrote about him he'll talk about virtues he doesn't just use one virtue and Express a point he calls all of those things knowledge temperance now he calls them virtues he calls them the qualities of God all right so then that's what we are to develop in the Christian life and remember as we ended up the message there the other day we ended up talking about where the Prophet was covering from the stature of a perfect man how that these seven virtues relating with the ages the brains the ages up you know all right then he brings the individual up and he says the ages and the individual come the same all right it's one on the other one only other one owner don't try to run up and get up way up above just let it go and let God bring it to you cause we're now brother branham say it I emphasize this over and over he says these things once you are born again now you remember these once you're born again you born yet in fact he said then these are the things that God expects us to add right now and he said don't worry about it the come on see I'm trying to bring up a wedge that's so hard until I don't want you to lean in too much backward but I don't want us to fall over this way too far all right see looking at those virtues the Prophet said don't worry about it they'll be automatically added no that's his words you read the book at least you're supposed to or listen to the tape all right anything yes we got down to the last of it paragraph 354 and on down through there a statue of a perfect man where he says now these ages brings up the church you know all right you come up the church emphasis somewhere in the Ferguson law they do see it all right he said that brings the church to the position of a rapture to be able to be made manifest all right now then he says and then this is the church see the individuals then come up through the ages you know the individuals come up through the ages to come forth to her that will be manifesting to in this age somebody will of a rapture to the church and it's these these things that brings us to that right circles we've got to come to the faith of the fathers you don't hear that taught in the message anymore when around us 1970 you kind of wish people were talking a little about faith the father's but now you hear no no where is such a great revelation deal where you know well that's all right but listen Church the Prophet is one that said it the Bible is the one it declared it you understand what I'm making the point hard and strong the Prophet declared melikhaya for to be the point of turning the hearts of the children back to the faith of the father all right and it be these divinely revealed mystery truths of the seven thunders he said 327 Church age book this messenger Malachi 4 luke 1730 revelation 10 7 in other words it's gonna do two things turn the hearts of the children back to the face of the father he said and reveal the thunders which is revelations containing the seven seals and instead it be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn us back alright so then if we ever expect to receive those virtues see then we must rely upon the prophets message of the studying of the message of the hour to let that message captivate us and because that will listen now what I'm saying that will let the Holy Spirit have something to make us grow thereby are you following me see then that way the Holy Spirit has something for you and I to grow by what the growth of the word God sent a prophet to make sure that would work he brought his message and delivered it now it's up to you and I because he said that that this ages this people the church ages and they would go in a rapture then he says the individuals by having these virtues will go into a rapture alright now we know that ever born-again believer goes in rapture but ever born again to believer won't stand there with the faith of the father's but yet they will be a group that does have the faith of the father's and that'll be what we're waiting on are crying out for for deliverance because of the message of the hour has the deliverance why wouldn't we want anything else well I I have to I just you know I'd like to uh to hear this brother I like to hear that brother well praise the Lord go hear him but then when they get off the word what are you gonna do and especially when you get caught with him you remember the little statement I made there Sunday about where the Prophet said awake thou that sleepless he said that was the bride in them denomination's well now do you think that's not tonight oh no that was way back yonder 4050 years ago that's true that's true but it's still here tonight oh no we're not in denominations lie brother Moute said he had a good point he said you've got your coat in your hat you changed meeting houses you know what that means is you hanging it up here and you go and you hang it up over there what's the difference you might as well left it hang it over there because if you're just gonna move to another meet in the house you see yeah well we don't have them denominational I did I'll quote you the Prophet if you want to go for a long ways with it remember but the rent said the Holy Ghost had been bound at the door our creeds and dogmas for 2,000 years now listen he said but to be loosed in the end time by this message the Holy Ghost can't be loosed until this message is brought into you and I I was running some quotes and I run across one and I just I start laughing and I just cut it out and I get to it in a minute but what was tickling me was that brother run said that's why we've been 40 years you know so he was back God forty years I started dying laughing I said why we've been here 40 years right why we've been here 40 50 years since the Prophet left the scene you know why for the same reason back God nobody wouldn't take in what the Prophet said they wouldn't believe in the Word of God oh yeah we're in the message we believe everything run around saying oh yeah yeah well just don't fool ourselves okay I mean fooling others is one time yeah but just remember don't try to fool yourself just be what you are and let Christianity dweller into you and let me get back to that point the word brother Bryan said don't worry about these virtues see it's not something to worry other than that sister in blasphemous name she was worried whether she had the baptism of the Holy Ghost or not well all of us should be worried about that no bless God I got it and if I say I ain't got it I mean God be lovely that's a good old Baptist statement I'll come up from that you know we can't deny the father you ain't never talked to a good Baptist about the Trinity and they say we can't deny the father because if we do now the father will deny the son so we got to believe that there's three of them you didn't talk to people but listen these things of prophets right if we make ourselves available to the message of the hour studying the message and everything it will automatically bring forth the things that it's promised the brain that's all I've ever tried to teach we try to figure this out try to figure this that well we got this brother went this way this brother went anyway but just be a Christian What did he say over this close to the life of this ebook not be in the seventh but he says going with a same simple message because if you don't you work yourself away from it well what's the same simple message it's a heart halfway could come up preaching the seals and he's preaching justification same casing the baptism with holy goes from the seals wouldn't that be the same simple message would not it be the fact of trying to understand what the new Burke really is and what it's to do it what do you see what I'm talking about see then they'll be automatically added when we lay ourselves available and what did the prophet said you know at one time you know we talked about we need different he said we're just too full you've been with that one we're just too full what we're full of ourselves we ain't too full of God no we're too full of ourselves that's what we need to do is get rid of ourselves and get into him alright what you see there the statute of perfect man then is to tell us that we must have those virtues if we're going to come to a change of the body now if not you're going by the grave that's that's what people they just you can misunderstand me you make me say things that I have no way of saying it and they're in no way did I say it but yet you make me say things because you think you understand what I'm talking about if it takes these virtues to come to a change of the body as your prophet said in the statue of a perfect man then it's going to take the verses it's like we need to know how to get the virtue milk out for Luke 17 there in Revelation 10 7 tells us how to get to virtues what by following the message and believing the message and walking into the man and making ourselves available it's not something that's and it's not an automatic willful it's automatic I don't have to do nothing now that's the wrong approach to automatic that's not what he's talking about right well I don't have to do nothing cause it's automatically added you got to be born again and you got to make yourself available then he can take care of things all right now in doing it that way then see we can come to a place of seeing that the Bible is trying to express all the way through to show us in types and shatters from the Old Testament because he Peters over here he's speaking of the statute of perfect land he's speaking that we are of this group of people that have escaped this corruption that is in the world through lust and we've become born again and were born again by faith in God oona Peter is explaining what we're coming to the new birth brings us to that part because the new birth is us covering Sunday the new birth is not a Naiad you don't add the new birth you've got a house something to add the virtuous to alright so the new birth is a birth you don't have the baby right the baby comes out a mattock all right see then that's where we come in to that place of sin Peter's explaining the virtues of what it takes in this to bring us to a place Paul goes all the way back into the Old Testament he takes all of the types in the shadows of the Old Testament and he brings it down to the what would be called the adoption all stages all right and as he's explaining it he's explaining in here in Galatians that an heir even though he's an error even though he's born in the family that he has nothing of his own at that time even though he owns all things he will eventually come out to own the whole things but yet he starts out as a baby and Paul's explaining said he's under tutors and governors until the time appointed see because then that puts him as a child but let's read something I want you to think on this let's say go ahead number wrong good number one I want you to think about it here's what I want you to think about while they're getting it up Peter's explaining now listen Peters explaining how to get where he was he said I'm a born-again Christian and I'm teaching you to how to climb this stature of a perfect man alright how to get to where he was because there's worth 120 120 was birth right here where it says the Holy Spirit but we don't get that we start off by faith as a newborn babe we've done been through all of that mm-hmm see Paul Peters explaining listen Peters explaining I have achieved this new earth and I'm talking to you that has this new birth and says we need to come to the place of being of the divine nature of Almighty God all right he's explaining how to get to the faith of the fathers so he starts and shows you that the connection is the new birth he's putting everything right on to you that how the new birth you now have the ability to be able to achieve these virtues are you with me now let's see if Paul says that all right so we read we read in Galatians about right now that he's no different now when your child was born Paul is explaining when a child was born into the family it had rights to everything but it couldn't claim nothing it was an error you could not disinherit you could not take it away that was his but he was a baby even though he was heir he had to be put under tutors and governors all right but remember now he's explaining that you have to be a baby for now let's drop back a chapter right for chapter dealing with there as long as he's you know huh so we'll just read it now say that the heir as long as he's our child now listen to his language as long as he's a child now physically you become a natural child huh that's what he's talking about spiritually you become an actor become a spiritual child by the new words they'll now listen differeth nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the Father even so we when we were children listen we're in bondage under the elements of the world because he explains in Romans and other how that we come lost right the Bible is explaining how we become lost and doomed and on the way to hell and we need to be born again all right now even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman right under the law to do what now to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because he are sons and watch him God has sent forth the spirit of the son into your hearts crying Abba Father wherefore they are no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ all right now we must lay aside a favorite doctrine of the people of this message always was eternal I know how to receive nothing I come in the world with eternal life I had eternal life when I come that's what I said we've got to lay those things aside because they're not scriptural Paul is explaining that we were under the elements of the world we were sinners lost in doom and had to be born again now watch him but when you receive the new birth what's what he's explaining we were children we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world we were lost doomed another way to hell but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law Jesus came under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might all receive that sonship learn to listen to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons he's using the adoption to explain Gunnarsson in because your son's will see that I'd always a son I always had eternal life well is that what you believe I mean do you believe that you always was eternal that you always had eternal life then why did Jesus have to die now the Bible here says because he was he came for what and because we're sons god sent forth the spirit of his son into our hearts crying Abba Father but you see that's where the people of the message they believe they've got quotes of all coño always was eternal but read the quote and read before and after and see if the Prophet don't say if you have eternal life then you always was eternal what the eternal life because if you always was eternal then listen to me listen this is why I know I get hateful an hour ago but it's hateful within me you realize if you don't need eternal life Jesus Christ died in vain because he died to release that life then it could come and live in us he died in vain you're making the Bible approach false prophecy you realize what you're doing when you say I come into the world with eternal life I don't need nothing I come on folks you call this doctrine you call that doctrine that doctrine was in 1970 called the to soul that you would born with to sold one from God one from the devil the one from God didn't need eternal life all you needed to do was kill the one that comes from the devil and he automatically was saved everything was finished that was the two soul doctrine and it's still here today among the people of the message in different ways in different forms he said well why tell us about it I'm preaching to you ain't preaching nobody else so you know what I'm assuming if I must preach this to you somebody in this building needs it it may be me first and I take that and I believe that but I believe also that people are still believing that same old time because you can't get over that so you can't just lay your whole life on the altar of God and say Lord come and save me o say that I say cause if I say I'd say then I ain't say and that means I'm lost you see one said I did what I did you see why I read what it did in the Prophet awake thou that sleepest get out of them denominations what Lulla eyes Loula eyes with brother Dale if we have one word off we're just as much a knight as anybody else's a knight that's as strong as I can put it but you see that's where I'm trying to tell you the Bible explains the plan of redemption to us what would we need redemption for if we always was eternal see that's making God's Word a false prophecy you realize what I mean if we always was eternal when Jesus Christ stood as a lamb slain for the foundation world that make the Bible of false prophecy you don't think that way do you realize what I just said are you listening if Jesus Christ didn't pay the price to release that life that was within him then it would make the Bible of false prophecy well that brother he just that's his wish I don't care what brother who you talking about I'm talking about anything off of the Word of God whether it be me you or who Italy all right see we think well we don't need eternal I co we already had it with in Jesus Christ died in vain and you make the entire Bible a false prophecy because the entire Bible listen that's what I'm trying to get you see with pollen feeder the entire Bible is explaining the plan of salvation Paul goes back into the Old Testament picks up the tops and the shadows from a son being born into the family and adoption of situation brought in and as he does he's explaining that that son not that he always was eternal and not it he who always was a son he had a day he became borned right so that does away with your eternal sonship sometimes now the day that baby was born he was born all right the day you was born again you was born again right tires were it all started in that new birth all right that's what Paul is explaining and taking the entire Old Testament to bring it forth you see how much did it it well if they don't ring in your heart then I under do you not know that you're responsible for your family do you not understand that nah ain't responsible for appellant believe me you're responsible to present it to him correctly if it's not presented correctly what are we so now listen Paul is saying because you are sons not that you didn't have to become he's using the baby of the Old Testament adoption that when he was born into the family he became a child of that family he was a Jones or Smith or whatever you want to call him he become of that name right then all right the end adoption goes through the tutorship of granting that tutorship to bring it to a position to where the son could be just like the father now I've asked you to read book sometime if you would please you know change to read adoption there's one books got three in it there's a bunch of here um there's a whole bunch the Prophet explains the adoption explains exactly what I'm talking about that the day you get born again you are just as much a child of God as you will ever be you are just as eternal in your soul the day you receive the new birth as you will ever be that new birth is Christ coming and living in you how much more simple then is it all you got to do is invite him into your heart all you got to do is invite him in you'll come in and you'll give you the new birth which is eternal huh all right then these virtues will be automatically added why because you'll be in the body of Christ you automatically Danny when you was born and your Mama and Daddy brought you you come from Underwood a baby well they fed him but that's all you could do well they wouldn't anything else they could do to add to him they didn't go get this and go get now notice you're standing and that's the way God does he just feeds us His Word and we grow in the world as we receive the word until we become what he wants us to be Christians why is it in the statute of a perfect man you've read it over and over that we me not no more hindered by all of these things of the world brother Dale I know I just I just don't understand because brother soul says it's just what brother so-and-so says it's out of way and brother stole what says it says away and this and says it's that away I just don't know which one to believe well I would suggest that you do what you ought to do I would suggest going on your knees and a closet and cry out to God is that sister did in blasphemous names when she was concerned whether she had the new birth or not she went to God and she cried out to get an answer God gave her a dream so much to answer her question and sent that dream to the Prophet to interpret that cry out to God and ask him Lord do I have it because I know for certain one thing I've got to have it to go in a chain through the body or else I'm going by the grave and come out to know some other way but for me to make a change the Prophet talks about it come take rapture and faith I was looking at that this evening some of the quote from the seal book it's gonna take rapture and faith for a bride to be able to be changed in a moment a twinkle of an eye but we call along haphazardly you know and don't get serious about any time but see this get the Bible to start reading it I remember brother Gary he the brother Gary Atkins he told him one time we won't even teach Sunday school and he said to a law well I'm not gonna teach Sunday school what I'm gonna teach I said well if I was you and I'm asking you to teach it and take that class and do it I said I got confidence in you and I said what I'd ask you to do is turn the Romans 1 yeah I don't know how to get there I said I didn't I said this turning to Romans 1 and you read Romans 1 and you start from there and you get up before that class and you explained Romans 1 to that class about two or three weeks later he come up and he said brother Dale I ain't got off of verse three yet I said and you won't because it'll open he'll tell you what to say just read it just read Romans 1 when you go home just read Romans 1 didn't just think about what do you say you know what I'm trying to get you to see is the point they'll get it this way for the point for the night Peter is explaining the virtues and we must have those virtues to be in the Statue of a perfect man Paul is explaining adoption they are both explained in the same thing it's not like a man that I remember years go said it you know he was a preacher he said that that statue of perfect man said that simple we said that adoption is deep I thought Lord what's wrong with a man it's the same thing now listen if I can read it to you from the Word of God that Peter now we've been through this a lot right so all right we need need to read it Peters explaining in 2nd Peter 1 he's explaining that he had those virtues and he was trying to explain to the people there that had the same new birth that he did he was explaining a growth development in the opening of God's Word are the faith of the father's to open up the Word of God to the people and he said device explaining the divine nature of Almighty God and now you had to grow into those things now is that what Peter's saying well let's read Paul and see what Paul is saying in his message just prior to Galatians 4 we just read in Galatians 4 desire is no different though he be a son he's no different he's a child no he be a son all right but you've got to be born again to be a son because the natural story he was using the child had to be physically born to be a part of that family all right and then the child would grow up as he was given tutors and governors now listen come on you that's been in the message quite a while why did brother Branham called the tutor of the statue of perfect man the Holy Ghost is the tutor all right if you always was eternal what do you need to hold a gun you see Church why it gets within my heart and I'm sorry but when we get over on that other side and we're standing there you won't be thinking the way you think now why would you need a tutor if you always was eternal and why would he give you the Holy Ghost as a tutor if you always was eternal well don't you think that the Holy Ghost is a tutor yeah because now he's teaching us something all right let's go ahead let's get started on this one go to Galatians three we'll just pick up an eleventh verse and read down now remember my point Peter you're saying we need these things and you're saying that you were that we were born-again by faith and that we need to put a curse of the divine nature so you're saying that was already dire we needed that you know that was in us by the new birth but we need a growth development all right now Paul what are you gonna say but then no man is justified by the law in the sight of God is evident for the just shall live by faith so where we starting off at same time Peter starts faith right Peter started to faith right where's Paul starting then what's him the Lord is not of faith but the man that doeth them shall live in them Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is every one that hangeth on the tree that's a blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith that we might receive so it's not saying we've already got it we just need to realize we got it and we're okay he's always talking about we need to receive it and how is it done promise of the Spirit through faith not speak after the manner of men though be it but a man's covenant if it be confirmed gnome and isn't this another or at estar to now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made and he says not and the seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ and this I say that the Covenant that was confirmed before of God in Christ the law which was 430 years after I was Abraham the law promise was made four hundred thirty years after cannot dishonor that it should make the promise of none effect for if the inheritance be of the law is no more promise but God gave it to Abraham by promise wherefore then serveth the law it was added because of transgressions till the seed singular should come to whom the promise was made and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator who this seed now mediator is not a mediator of one but God is one is the law then against the promises of God God forbid where if there had been a law givers which could have given life verily righteousness should have been by the law if there was any other way to come to eternal life then through Jesus Christ then why didn't God bring it that way are you reading but the scripture hath concluded all under sin oh no we wouldn't sinners don't tell me I descend I always was eternal was you an eternal center because the Bible says you're a sinner the prophets said you're a sinner he said on the Christians sin am i right now was you an eternal sinner no I hate eternal life you're still playing under the law you have come to the seed yet listen is the law then against the promises of God god forbid or if there had been a law given which could have given life verily righteousness should have been by the law if there's any good and anything is sure to come by that and it didn't do it like but the scripture hath concluded all under sin that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that belief oh no what but before faith came we were kept under the law before faith came you were kept under the law come on I walked out of the Baptist Church realizing one time and I've always talked this ever person in the world unless you're born again you're still under the law I don't care who you are I don't care how righteous you think you are you're under the law if you're not born again why because the Bible says Christ is the end of the law for righteousness and I walk out of that Baptist Church I realized knowing one thing for sure everybody was lost and needed a savior so when I come in this message that I need to have to study from the Prophet to find out now when he began to say always was eternal I knew he was saying something he wasn't saying what we were saying he was trying to get us to see something come on now we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed wherefore the law was our schoolmaster and what like sinful one he says we don't need a schoolmaster we don't need governor's huh Bree he's telling what a schoolmaster which is the same word as as governor we're for the law was our schoolmaster now come on that's why Paul said the law was spiritual you remember that's Christian he said but I'm carnal sold under sin the law was the Word of God in letter form which was God in letter form to come to condemn us we just read it the law was added because of transgressions what to condemn us to make us realize we were lost the law was to make us realize rude law not to make us think we're something this message was not brought to make us think we're something it was brought to show us who we are that without Christ we're lost without a new birds we have no hope there is no rapture for anybody if we don't get mourned again what I just always wanted eternal will fifty years from the time you started saying that you still sitting here dying sorry brother Dale just I know it I say things that is just hateful but one of these days you'll hug my neck and you'll say thank you sir because that shook me enough that night to make me wake up if there's nothing you see no whatsoever if you need a tutor why did he give you the Holy Ghost if you already had to hold it up and I don't see why people can't understand that's plain language why would he give you the Holy Ghost if you already have eternal life oh you just don't understand the great mystery that is a mystery we're for the law Paul what is the law it's virtual the law is the Word of God now brother Branham said the Ten Commandments was the same as the seals you remember that you need that quote the Ten Commandments is the same as the seals seals is Simon's ten command so what are the seals to reveal wage was striking a Sunday afternoon on the third seal of seeing marriage and divorce I said it in 82 I don't back up I said in 82 that marriage and divorce is revealed in the seals it was in the seals everything is revealing to see is ke o wherefore the law was our schoolmaster for what to bring us unto Christ that we might be justified by faith see the law is just bringing you to cross it's just condemns you that's all the law was added for for a condemnation it couldn't save you yet it was the Word of God yet it was spiritual as Paul said but all they could do was condemn you until you got born again then you can be justified by faith then you can see what Jesus Christ was doing and why you had to accept him as your Savior then when you accepted him as your Savior he went from a schoolmaster to a governor or tutor a schoolmaster which had condemned you to a governor or tutor which took your place as long as that tutors there you don't have to worry about anything as long as that governor is with you you do not have to worry about nothing Satan can't get to you until God is through we don't care how old you get what are they they can't get to you look now you said wait a minute what know what what you okay or for the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ that we might be justified by faith but after faith is come we are no longer under a schoolmaster the Galatians 4 says we're under tutors and governors the word governors are the same word is schoolmaster what's it saying Paul what are you talking about you're telling me over here I don't that I've got to have a tutor a governor to child trained me but just prior to that you're saying the schoolmaster was done away and we don't need a schoolmaster anymore you know what the law really is the law is a record keeper you realize that they would be no record of your sin had law not entered the picture why did Jesus have to go preach to the spirits that was in prison that were disobedient longsuffering today's or Noah because they had no condemnation come on get into Word there was no condemnation back there because the law had not come all they had was a couple of prophets Enoch Noah why did Jesus have to go to them why does it say that group that he had to go to those that that were disobedient in the long-suffering of days of Noah why didn't it say that that he went to preach to all of them because they had the law see when the law came into existence through Moses from their own you had a condemn err you had a judge and a law set before you and that's why I said what I did and I've always believed it that if you're not born again you are still under the law the law is you're condemned err if you're not born again you see why the new birth is the most important thing that could ever be thought of in your life well brother bill you scare me I don't know that well then you're getting scared about the Holy Ghost seek God but look where for the law is our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ now you how long you want to stay you want me to preach for a couple of hours on one topic you know that brother Branham said the denomination's was our schoolmaster oh now you're going to go haywire I didn't say it he did I'll find that quote well how come because they were law givers reformers right Tojo and through that Reformers back in reformers Luther Wesson in reformers you went to church you had a book a rule set before you come on you went to church you took on those rules and you started trying to live by them don't do this don't do that don't do this don't do that then you try to make it your righteousness that's what the denominations don't know yes I didn't say it your prophet did he said in denominations with a schoolmaster I thank God for what they've done for me let's go don't thank God then walk around when they promote backyard I'm gonna prostitute you better remember you as one of them if I could go today and every preacher that I've ever heard preach no matter who he was Methodist Baptist or what and I could raise him from the dead I'd shake his hand say thank you sir I've had to leave a couple of churches in his message but there's one thing about it I never left with the wrong thought in my mind and I told each one of those brothers I appreciate what you've done for me because you've brought me to Jesus Christ how do you feel would you go back now where you come from and get up and say thank you for teaching me what little bit you could about Jesus Christ there's something wrong way if you came to church look or for the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ to bring us to the new birth then we might be justified by faith the new birth but after that faith has come we are no longer under a schoolmaster the new birth is not a book of rules it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you it's not a book of rules the new birth has no rules in it that's why brother would not listen that's why brother Branham said statue a perfect man he said you get born again you receive eternal life by faith by believing in Jesus Christ he said you don't have to worry now come on am i quoting it you don't have to worry about Virtue's they will be automatically added not automatically added coach you fault fooling around at Walmart name studying come on it's automatically added because you healed yourself Ian - Jesus Christ and after that faith has come we are no longer under a schoolmaster but Galatians 4 he says were under tutors and governors so it changed from a schoolmaster which was a book of rules to a revelation of Jesus Christ as our tutor as a governor to lead us and direct us after that faith has come we're no longer under a schoolmaster for you're all the children of God by faith in Jesus Christ for as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female and you're all one in Christ and if you be Christ's then are you Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise Oh what are you saying Peter is explaining to them in 2nd Peter that you need to be born again you you you people sitting here you've said you've accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior now let's go on in God let's grow up in him that we'd be no longer children tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine an idea of man's cunningness let's go on him Christ Paul what are you doing all is telling you the law was your schoolmaster to bring you to Christ what would you been without the law unless God we don't need no law see that's where you don't understand nothing about the gospel that law was put there to bring you to a condemnation you would have not known Paul said the it was wrong what how does he say it now if I misquote the script but he said you wouldn't have known that was wrong too to committed how did he say it to do lust if it hadn't said thou shalt not come on somebody quote the scripture for me you wouldn't have known it had the Bible had not told you not to covet you were to know that it was wrong if the law had not brought the condemnation there was no grace and listened there was no grace in the law it was a condemned ER but while the law was here grace was present Nathan - David does that rightly the one that contacted David death Nathan walks in and he says David we got a little situation out here this happened he said we got a problem then we got this man over here that says he's got all of these goats and sheep and huh and said he looks over to neighbor and he sees one the low goat one little sheet one of the lamb and he says I'll go take that lamb what should we do what would be David what would be the law what would be the commandments of the law brought by Moses what are we supposed to do with this man David said bring him here I'll kill him read your Bible see if I'm telling it right bring him here I'll kill him Nathan look back and said David thou art the man when I watch him as quick as he said it he knew David was condemned and David would have condemned his own self probably would have cut his own throat because he knew who he was and what he was doing and he was standing there but before the law could bring the judgment of the punishment down upon David for what he done a prophet remember what we're trying to bring out Sunday the Thunder is the voice of God through the prophet god thundered through that prophet Nathan and said David you shall not die said I paid for you Richy Bible said David you shall not die from the voice of a man comes salvation to a king no wonder David could rest of his life cry out he instilled it so much that was in Saul I mean in Solomon but David could cry out Lord return unto me the joy of thy salvation Lord my soul longs after you O Lord I've seen you you gave me life when my judgment was death and I condemned my own self by what I said come on David said bring him I'll kill him but he said David you're the man which said you won't die see the law had no grace because the law meant David died that was it but God sent grace that totally overrode the law and everything and said David you won't die blessed is the man the Bible says that God will not impute sin is that Scripture well then we must get by with anything that wouldn't work now I'll remind you that David spent the rest of his life I'm asking you to read your Bible read your songs of Solomon read and read are the David to writing in the Psalms maybe your whichever one is he in the songs or the doing that David wrote saw it's all wrote Solomon wrote the other but David spent the rest of his life trying to find peace with God not that God was against David to kill him I was thinking about that today it's no problem to do wrong we all do what was your is wrong I think I didn't say that you ain't listening we all do wrong we all do and we condemn our own selves but you know what's the worst sin I tried to explain it now quit on me the worst sin that you could ever think of what is it what is the worst sin that you could think of anything you want to name in the Bible we'll find those guys that have that spot David had a man kill David done this David done that solve all Samson every one of them everybody but what's the greatest sin you could think of the most condemning thoughts in my mind is one thing for me to know that God will not throw me away because he gave me the new birth you can't sin enough to get rid of the Holy Ghost sorry but that's just me you can't sin enough but if you sin you prove once y'all now we're right back where we started but the worst thing that I can think of is for me to realize that I can get by and that God won't destroy me because he didn't destroy David but for me to think that I could get by with it the most horrible sin in our thoughts and our lives is to think of those things because listen church if you're born again God may have to take you off singing I mean we know the whole story all right we're in the message we know the whole story he may have take you off the scene but he can't take back eternal life if he gave it to you but for me to know that and think that I can get by it sends you to your knees to cry out for an eternal God to try to save me from myself all should deliver me Lord from this man that I am to anybody that's ever accepted Jesus Christ as our Savior and tried to walk in Christ will come to a place that God will contact you and let you know how everything is and what's going on so just wait on him it may take another 50 years but whose word so that means I won't be harder than screaming at you 50 years ago but I pray somebody else will because of one thing Paul and Peter was saying the same thing there was a channel 2 way to come to God Paul calls it adoption now if you notice I cut it off right at that line because we had cut off on the statute of perfect lamb right at that line of where it says next will be add to your faith virtue because Peter is saying you are born-again Christians out there you want to be partakers of the divine nature of Almighty God said now we're gonna have to add virtue Paul comes along he said a child is no different though he be heir of all things when he's born he's a baby and he has to have a growth development to arise in Christianity and he will be given a tutor Peter you could say Peter what he doing he said I want you to realize now listen church Peter I want you to realize that that Holy Spirit you received is your tutor he's your governor he's your advocate he's everything that you have need of so just let him add his own life to your life just let him manifest himself through you is that not exactly what Paul will say it the Sun when he's born new birth he's birth he gets a birth and says now he's given no longer a schoolmaster it's well I love that I I've got that marked in my Bible here goes to here because here he says this and that's even the exact same definition of governor is the same definition of schoolmaster but yet up here he's telling you that you had a schoolmaster then down here he says you don't need a schoolmaster the next verse later on you don't need a schoolmaster II said because you've changed from a schoolmaster a lawgiver a book of rules you change to a revelation of Jesus Christ you change to work that he would be your tutor your governor you realize the day you receive the new birth you received a tutor you were brought into the family of God by the new birth of faith and when we were brought into that family that makes us a child of God whereby we cry out my father father father is what we cry he'll take care of the rest of it if we'll just volunteer ourselves it's not a hard thing to do and I'll tell you it's honest that I can do it and if they don't make you shout then that's alright I believe we're a whole lot further up the road and we even think we are I do but just don't let that blow your head too much you know what I mean I mean you know a lot of people if they've preached the things that I preached over the years that I've been here you couldn't get their head inside this building cuz it blow it so big but you know what it's done with - shrunk it - one time Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to them that believe if you've accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior then there's nothing more that could be other than taking you to a change and he'll do that but if we don't volunteer ourselves what do we do like I said I have to quote in here where the Prophet said I looked in Pentecost and thought we had 40 years that we've been way and I said to our life and I said Lord it's been over 40 years since the Prophet left this thing and we're still Harlan and stumping around Horeb trying to get ready to go into the Promised Land come on musicians be then that's where we've come to it's off the message and thy seed shall possess the gate of the enemy that's what it is today we've had about 40 years of testing of Pentecost or more C testing the church seeing whether they're going to stand or not I hope you follow this out we'll pick it back up Sunday and this reminds you of it if you're if you're a schoolmaster has not turned into a tutoring governor you need the new birth your schoolmaster brought you to Christ come on your schoolmaster brings you to Christ well how much more could be there bring me the cross is have Christ accept you and come and live in you it changes from a schoolmaster and you no longer as Paul said need him but then the very next verse when he explains the adoption he says you get a tutor or governor it changed from a book of rules and regulations and ideas our thoughts and opinions we had it changed to a revelation of Jesus Christ from this message let's tan well we got ready Bank on these things standing on the promises standing on the promises of Christ by King through eternal ages let us pray I'm a trained warrior I will shout and sing a schoolmaster to be in godliness to him stay and then when he comes I'm standing on promises Woodley standing all the

you're sincere you believe but it's not hard dude not a hard thing to do it's just exactly [Music] it just accept [Music] standing on listen church I've always tried to be straight and honest with you and you know what I mean it's true that I'd do anything in the world I could to see you saved I'm do anything I could any way that I could or anything and there's not a person in this building I don't believe even to the little children because we've proved it many times but if I offered you and say I'll give you $100 if you just come right up here and accept it well I mean you would have no thoughts about coming and doing it right you wouldn't you wouldn't be concerned you'd say well okay he said he'd do it I believe it no but you see that's just believing me how much more can you believe God then all you got to do is just pour your heart out to him and say thank you lord it ain't a hard thing to do is just say thank you lord you know we've tried our best to save ourselves we've tried to do this tried to make ourselves better try to do this try to repair that and all that was well and good but all we should have done was just went straight to him we're listening to the jorgensen you know the reading and things of random and all and was listening here the other week about him explaining his experience or the lady you know that's telling it on the phone well you get down in brother Browns experience and you'll find he's over here doing one time you'll find he's over here doing something you'll find he's over there doing something and I know why you want to say well where's the app and see you're trying to figure out well where was he doing and you're trying to do the same thing he said I got down and said you know and I'm sure he must have put his hands or something he said I've heard people say you put your hands you know and he probably done something like this you know it any problem but he said it didn't work he said he not done this and I've done that and after a while he said it like this he said no sir he says I'm gonna just talk to you you remember that said sir I'm gonna just talk to you so now I know you I can't understand your language or whatever you say some way like everyone said I just won't talk to you you know what it's become a serious matter that he was standing there and didn't know how to do anything else he said I don't talk to you why don't you sometime in the middle of the night children dog why don't you just get on the edge of the bed god I just won't talk to you I just won't talk to you I want you to come into my heart and save me I want you to just become my guardian my Savior my all and all and you do whatever it takes to take care of me to supply everything I don't know nothing about it I'm just putting my hand in my heart into your hands Lord and just you just come and save my soul you see that's where people don't understand me because they think that that I'm not emotional I'm not this but there's one thing about it if you get saved there's going to be an emotion in your heart there's going to be a rejoicing within you you may not let it out that everybody else sees it but it's going to be there you're going to shout and you're going to cry glory hallelujah but it may be in your own little prior closet and nobody here that's the way God can do that because it's according to your nature in your ways and your thinking determines a lot of it but the main thing is just to talk to them have you ever got to where you Clinton pray you've never been that far done you ain't never been that far down and beat down that you couldn't pray you got a long ways to go one of these days you're gonna get tired you say you're scaring me and no I'm just telling you it's gonna happen someday that you're gonna get to a place until where use his combs like Lord ain't nothing I can do but just say thank you for saving my soul just talk to him like he's an individual because he is and you know what here you know they nobody hooked in on your telephone line so don't worry about telling him everything right don't be concerned well I might say something that some other angel might hear don't worry about it you got a personal line straight to the Lord and you talk straight to him and just say Lord save me I'm sorry I'm sorry for being the way I am Lord just save me you know you might find out things might work a little different right see we've been taught it's this away or this people they donated and we want to follow after them and that's all but it's something personal to you some person he's your Savior but I hope you listened to what I was saying what about the Bible Paul saying was a schoolmaster to bring us to Christ one verse later he says the schoolmaster is gone we're no longer under a schoolmaster 10 verses next an opening of the next chapter and he's talking about how you as a child and that God gave you himself as a tutor or governor did he take away the schoolmaster again now he opened the word to let you realize he made the word alive David what was in he's adored in order that word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against these either him or Solomon 1 what a wonderful thing that a man could think about father I pray that what we said tonight has been worthy I'm sorry for the way of saying it cause I'm just human but I'm crying out unto you to get away to express the things that we have need of and in doing that I know I stumble and fall after many things but yet I still want one thing and that's you Lord to manifest yourself among us here they don't make no difference what this is or what that is it's all in you help us to just walk upright in your love Lord and to see you made manifest and each one of our hearts and lives we love you we thank you be with us on the way home take care of everybody give a safe journey let your grace be sufficient got each one Lord you've really luison them as they're traveling be with all of the things and let your loving grace be with us in Jesus name you dis me excuse me hold on this meant everybody [Music] you dismissed remember the service is Sunday for one for another [Music] I [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
