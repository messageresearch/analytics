[0:40] I want to teach you a little lesson
[0:46] about the positive power of prayer so
[0:56] that's our objective today is to
[0:58] understand the importance and everybody
[1:00] see that okay to understand the
[1:04] importance of offering our fervent
[1:05] sincere prayers to God
[1:10] 1st Thessalonians 5 now we exhort you
[1:13] brethren warn them that are unrolling
[1:15] cumference of people minded support the
[1:18] weak be patient toward all men and see
[1:21] the done remember to use for evil unto
[1:23] any man but ever follow that which is
[1:25] good both among yourselves and to all
[1:27] men rejoice evermore pray without
[1:30] ceasing and everything give thanks for
[1:33] this is the will of God in Christ
[1:35] concerning you when it's not the spirit
[1:37] the spots not brought the signs prove
[1:39] all things hold fast that which is good
[1:43] and I've heard it said a lot I believe
[1:46] it frame without ceasing nothing
[1:47] necessarily mean going round eyes blow
[1:49] to head value hands in your prayer
[1:51] position all the time it dissipates a
[1:54] prayerful attitude always be in
[1:56] communication with the Lord in turning
[1:57] for Christ every moment of every day and
[2:00] be mindful about the Lord and leading of
[2:04] the Lord just be consoling a
[2:07] fair-weather and keep your mind on God
[2:13] the prophet Elijah that's the sermon
[2:16] title post realize it sometimes we go
[2:19] off on a tangent somewhere and not think
[2:21] about God not pray over it ask them or
[2:24] whether we should do it or not and we
[2:26] find out that our sub lesson is cut off
[2:28] then we wonder sometimes well wonder why
[2:31] can't have them your blessings
[2:32] you don't want you let down your prayer
[2:34] life you say well I'm a Christian well
[2:37] that's the more sign you should pray
[2:38] more than ever being at the Bible every
[2:40] day pray every day don't like any
[2:44] decision too harshly or too quickly
[2:45] without first seeing God that asking
[2:48] should I do this father asked you makes
[2:50] it your will for me to do this and then
[2:52] see what the Holy Spirit will speak to
[2:53] you you might not give you a vision but
[2:56] he will speak in some way to you to let
[2:58] you know if you'll be sincere and ask
[3:01] we tend to look some kind of big flashy
[3:03] billboard you know especially big
[3:04] decisions you know in life we want God
[3:06] to make a real obvious and sometimes
[3:08] it's real so and we just have to be
[3:11] watching and prayerfully be attending
[3:15] this is from Charles Spurgeon I got this
[3:19] off the internet
[3:21] in February 10th 1867 the Metropolitan
[3:26] Tabernacle Newington appointment where
[3:28] that's at the time was this time when
[3:32] the title was the dawn of revival or
[3:35] prayer speedily answered and is what
[3:38] this was his little text he preached
[3:40] from that morning at the beginning of
[3:43] your supplications that commandment came
[3:45] forth and I come to show you where you
[3:47] are greatly beloved Daniel 9 works a
[3:49] thought further way because he started
[3:51] into this Daniel 70 weeks series and
[3:55] mrs. Hart had - we should have going
[3:57] into this thing like that is prayer
[4:01] prayer cool attitude prayer is used in
[4:03] the thousand ways and especially what
[4:06] the old physician sought after naturally
[4:09] mainland telephone thank you guys now
[4:14] Catholicism it's pathetic on a remedy of
[4:18] universal application there is no case
[4:21] of me the stress or dilemma in which
[4:24] prayer will not be found to be a very
[4:26] present help in the case before us
[4:29] Daniel had been studying the Book of
[4:32] Jeremiah and had learned that God that a
[4:34] comfort accomplished seventy weeks in
[4:36] the best selection of Jerusalem they
[4:38] felt that there was still more to be
[4:40] learned and instead his face to learning
[4:43] his was the noble and acute mind and
[4:46] with all this energies he sought to pry
[4:49] into the prophetic meaning but he did
[4:52] not rely upon his own judgment he betook
[4:54] himself at once to prayer prayer is that
[4:57] great key which opens miss
[4:59] open up warrior over there's about four
[5:01] or five slides of this it's not the
[5:02] whole journey
[5:02] he's just just introduction to a sermon
[5:05] to whom shall we go for an explanation
[5:08] if we can understand the riding but
[5:10] today all through the book Daniel
[5:12] appealed at once to the great author and
[5:15] whose hand Jeremiah had been the pen so
[5:18] Jeremiah was the rider but really they
[5:20] offered the book of jeremiah zola go
[5:23] slowly spirit and lonely retirement the
[5:26] president knelt upon sneeze and crying
[5:28] to God that he would open up to him the
[5:31] mystery of the policy that he might know
[5:33] the full meaning of the 70 weeks and
[5:35] what God intended to do in their home
[5:37] and how it would have people to behave
[5:39] himself to obtain deliverance from their
[5:40] captivity Daniel made his suit to the
[5:43] Lord to unloose the seals and open the
[5:45] body of the book and he was heard and
[5:47] favored with the knowledge which you
[5:48] might have sought for in vain by any
[5:51] other means so it looked in maybe other
[5:53] people's writings it might have been in
[5:55] vain because you know people's ideas but
[5:57] he looked to prophet Jeremiah and to the
[6:00] Holy Ghost for billy the particular
[6:03] point in the text to which I would
[6:06] director attention this morning is the
[6:07] gangs prayer was answered at once while
[6:10] he was yet speaking I and at the
[6:13] beginning of his supplication not always
[6:15] so prayer sometimes Terry's like a
[6:17] petitioner at the gate until the King
[6:19] comes forth the filler bosom with the
[6:21] blessings which he sees the Lord when he
[6:24] has given great faith has been known to
[6:26] try about long delays he has suffered
[6:29] his sermons forces to echo in their ears
[6:31] as from a bronze sky now where sometimes
[6:35] let's just go a while the answer our
[6:37] prayers it seems like hey patience if
[6:40] you will bless the book of inspiration
[6:42] before your identify and that's the Lord
[6:44] to open up its meaning to you the
[6:46] exercise of prayer itself shall be
[6:48] blessed by God to put your soul to the
[6:50] best thing which to get at the hidden
[6:53] meaning which lies concealed from the
[6:54] eye of the worldly wise for which is
[6:57] clearly manifested to make him lower
[6:59] Souls when they revel in seek the
[7:01] guidance of their having fathered this
[7:04] this brother branham from Gabriel's
[7:06] instructions to Daniel if Dan of the
[7:09] pulpit of the Lord could consult
[7:10] Jeremiah's books and bring him to such a
[7:12] place that even Israel coming out all
[7:14] them alive what's coming out of that one
[7:17] to go back to the homeland what caused
[7:19] him to faster sackcloth and ashes
[7:21] how much more audience did to the Church
[7:23] of the Living God to know that time is
[7:24] fading out and shall be no more in the
[7:26] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and the
[7:28] great palainian ready to sit in Hockley
[7:31] spin waste this time gambling swimming
[7:34] hold on Sunday no time for Lord I know
[7:36] we don't that the gambling is coming
[7:37] hold we didn't economical or just run
[7:41] down pastor speak some something of your
[7:43] life get up and go out dissatisfied look
[7:46] at our condition so why do we need to
[7:49] pray Matthew 26
[7:52] watch and pray that ye enter not into
[7:53] temptation of the Spirit is willing but
[7:55] the flesh is weak
[7:57] that's one thing jesus said while we
[7:58] need to pray for their flesh between
[8:01] another reason why we need to pray mark
[8:03] 13 heaven on earth shall pass away but
[8:05] my words shall not pass away
[8:06] but on that day and that hour knoweth no
[8:09] man no not the angels which are in
[8:11] heaven neither the son but the father
[8:13] taking heed watch and pray do you know
[8:17] not when the time is for the son of man
[8:19] it says a man taking a far journey who
[8:21] left his house and gave authority to his
[8:24] servants and every man his work and
[8:26] commanded the porter to watch watching
[8:28] therefore for you know not when the
[8:30] master of the house comes and even we're
[8:32] midnight recovering the more
[8:35] less time sudden they find you sleeping
[8:37] maybe not naturally but spiritually
[8:39] sleeping they're not seeing your day in
[8:41] your house and what I say unto you I say
[8:44] unto all watch
[8:46] another reason why we need to pray
[8:48] brother Brown from the message who is
[8:50] this but there will be a remnant there
[8:53] will be those who know God and who are
[8:55] watching and are charged and they'll see
[8:56] him for he'll come as a thief in the
[8:58] night will be caught up to meet Lord in
[9:00] heir secret going away to the church so
[9:03] I tell you knowing all this beforehand
[9:05] by the word of the Lord we should pray
[9:07] and study every hour of our life making
[9:10] it ready for that great event and while
[9:12] they Hertz charmed with his presence and
[9:13] while we are believing in the anointed
[9:15] ministers of the gospel are sending out
[9:17] the Thunderbolts in the morning we
[9:18] should be prepared for any man for that
[9:21] blessed event and we shall see all that
[9:25] has died in Christ of the ages when we
[9:27] will see Jesus coming to get his church
[9:29] will the car when we come in the air so
[9:33] prayer is a part of worship that's just
[9:35] obvious we know that prayer is very
[9:38] necessary for us to become one with the
[9:40] Lord as he desires us to
[9:48] all right
[10:05] so John 17 that they all make they want
[10:08] as thou father art in me and I in thee
[10:11] that they also may be one in us that the
[10:14] world may believe that thou sent me this
[10:18] is I got this whole prayer of John 17 of
[10:20] Jesus's Prayer at the very end of the
[10:22] lesson public get to it Joe no I said
[10:24] the whole chapter is the prayer of Jesus
[10:26] basically praying that he and father
[10:28] would be one that we would be one and
[10:30] that Jesus and that that would be
[10:34] because there's not Jesus than us it's
[10:36] it's God in his pride so that's the
[10:39] whole prayer it basically summed up in
[10:42] that why do we need to pray prayer is
[10:46] also necessary for our character
[10:47] development through prayer we learned to
[10:50] love and forgive our enemies in prayer
[10:53] we also can tell they confess our love
[10:55] to the Lord thanking him praising him
[10:57] reminded them of what it means to us and
[11:01] about that I'll say about praying for
[11:03] our enemies how can you still hate
[11:05] someone or or not love something really
[11:08] if you're praying for them constantly
[11:09] even though they make the spies users
[11:11] people I work with that I have no idea
[11:12] why they're always mad at me or why they
[11:14] dislike me so much but I don't worry
[11:17] about it I just pray for them and I
[11:18] really can't help but fill up for them
[11:21] because I'm constantly praying for them
[11:22] and thinking about it when asked the
[11:24] Lord to save their soul so it really it
[11:26] kind of takes away that element that's
[11:28] human part of us so wanting to draw back
[11:31] at somebody or any kind of feel feelings
[11:33] towards someone if you're praying for
[11:34] them so do you said love your enemies
[11:36] pray for them responsibly use you but
[11:40] this is similar even to our natural love
[11:42] we have for our spouse but continually
[11:45] express our love to them there are many
[11:46] ways we must stay in constant communion
[11:49] with Christ reminding it now what you
[11:51] think of him along to serve from Hebei
[11:54] there's a little thing on this note
[11:56] about Gaby this little thing that I
[11:58] think constantly is I write a love
[11:59] letter stirred and I know she knows I
[12:02] love her but I like to be constantly
[12:04] telling her what
[12:05] about how much I love her and I found
[12:07] that as I've been doing it for some time
[12:08] now I didn't creases my love for her and
[12:10] her love for me it just makes
[12:12] relationship even stronger and so you
[12:14] through that your relationship with
[12:16] Christ constant remind him of what he
[12:17] means to you and how much you love him
[12:19] and that's one thing you do is through
[12:21] prayer is something you can do any time
[12:22] anything anywhere it's just a free thing
[12:26] that you you know he hears you and
[12:28] sometimes maybe you don't feel like he
[12:30] does maybe you don't get a fairly her
[12:31] sensation like he's heard your prayer
[12:33] but you know the future and he loves to
[12:37] hear from so Butterball's been on this
[12:39] recently about the tabernacle and the
[12:43] wilderness so until he talked about this
[12:50] reason I didn't really understand the
[12:52] extent of all those little all the
[12:53] pieces of furniture it's on the outer
[12:56] court inner court nobody's home holy of
[12:58] holies I didn't understand really how
[12:59] that pertained to us so very glad he
[13:02] went over that and I'll kind of review
[13:04] some of that because when you get down
[13:07] to the inside here that incense altar
[13:11] that's what we're talking about today's
[13:12] prayer that's how we offer a bargain
[13:14] sense to God is prayer don't think about
[13:17] the father in front of that element
[13:18] basically I think you said something
[13:21] about that every one of these you should
[13:22] be able to relate to your experience at
[13:24] the brass and altar you identify with
[13:27] some Christ dying or you've been
[13:29] crucified for your sin and every one of
[13:31] these pieces of furniture you should be
[13:33] able to identify your own experience
[13:34] with
[13:37] there's something very significant about
[13:38] each one of those in our lives all right
[13:42] so let's see here
[13:47] I was thinking about it this morning
[13:48] that's reflecting a little bit on some
[13:50] of this and since brother Aaron's here
[13:51] what's the old saying goes I'd rather
[13:53] give him a rose bouquet rose down than a
[13:56] bouquet later or something like that
[13:58] America is far different brother never
[14:01] preached the start of my sanctification
[14:02] and has always been on my mind that
[14:05] because I didn't I don't think of every
[14:07] poem this but I didn't know my
[14:09] sanctification was a Baptist I was here
[14:11] is in that outer core of justification
[14:13] that's all I knew
[14:13] it's coming in and getting saved that's
[14:16] all I noticed past stands being chopped
[14:17] off
[14:18] well I still had a desire for the things
[14:19] in the world there were some very wrong
[14:21] things I was doing that I knew was wrong
[14:23] but I had a December form and I was
[14:26] literally taught in the Baptist Church
[14:27] you can't help what you do you just
[14:29] plead the blood that's all you can do so
[14:31] in other words the guy that told me that
[14:33] I have to know his brother several of us
[14:36] know that his brother was sleeping with
[14:37] his girlfriend
[14:38] boy was sleeping with his girlfriend
[14:40] they weren't married and we all gather
[14:43] round ladies I'm afraid I snorted
[14:44] forgiven and he told me that's all you
[14:46] can do was played the blood nothing Wow
[14:48] it's pretty sad that going to help us a
[14:51] better Catholic get a man get her saved
[14:54] and I stayed here for several years on
[14:56] 12 when I came home to the Lord and for
[14:58] the next 2-3 years I still did some
[15:00] things that were very wrong that I knew
[15:01] what's wrong I felt condemned and
[15:02] convicted for it and I even prayed the
[15:04] sinner's prayer again you know it's
[15:06] something in the Baptist Church every
[15:09] sermon to a Baptist minister preaches he
[15:11] gives an altar call at the end and Isis
[15:13] if you want to pray the prayer of
[15:14] salvation about the Lord to your heart
[15:16] I prayed again there is none anything
[15:18] well I didn't get last time daddy I
[15:20] would sincere enough I guess because I
[15:22] went out there on this week again so I
[15:23] pray that sinner's prayer every Sunday
[15:25] sincerely for a long time and yet remain
[15:28] down here in this outer court but along
[15:31] about 14 years old I started reading the
[15:33] Bible a little bit and began to be
[15:37] sanctified at least on this outer court
[15:39] of sanctification I guess you could call
[15:40] it a washing
[15:42] your hands and the priest would wash
[15:44] their hands on I believe their feet
[15:45] before they go into that Airport so it's
[15:48] like our actions and our deeds and where
[15:50] we go and the things we do you start to
[15:53] be purged of those things to some degree
[15:54] because reading the Bible every day
[15:57] they'll be a spirit of conviction come
[15:59] on you'll say you'll read something that
[16:01] you know you're not lining up to so you
[16:03] can't help it's inevitable that some of
[16:05] those things start to go out and the
[16:07] other corner well then I went on when I
[16:10] can message a lot of good think this is
[16:12] silly I was still holding on to
[16:13] Christian Romero music and brother Aaron
[16:16] priests Christian rock is a frog who I
[16:20] guess it was when I started going here
[16:22] I'm real mad at him I loved it and not
[16:29] only listen to it but I plated in my
[16:30] band and that was my form of ministry we
[16:33] was in a little Christian rock band and
[16:35] we were having playing places trying to
[16:36] get people say to Christian rock music
[16:38] and then he stepped all over my toes but
[16:41] what happened is with that preaching the
[16:43] keep there came a spirit of conviction
[16:45] and it convicted my heart heavily and I
[16:46] took noumenal play that music because
[16:48] that I think was that very night a band
[16:50] went to play at a place in Gainesville
[16:53] Annis and it was the unplugged session
[16:56] who will know
[16:57] electric guitars just me playing my
[16:59] bongos and even that caused the spirit
[17:03] Commission to come home and I had to
[17:04] walk backstage and I quit the band that
[17:06] never played it again but where their
[17:08] priests started my same profession it
[17:10] was kind of that because that had to go
[17:12] before I could grow spiritually
[17:14] I couldn't grow spiritually holding on
[17:15] to something like that and rock music of
[17:19] any form is wrong but that's where I can
[17:22] identify with this inner core and I kept
[17:26] growing much more after that the band
[17:28] the guys I explained it to him and the
[17:30] didn't understand I guess don't
[17:32] understand this day why I had to quit
[17:34] all of a sudden but you know the Lord
[17:36] convicted my heart very heavily and I
[17:38] didn't understand why I was wrong I just
[17:40] moved he convicted me - brother Eric's
[17:42] preaching and I had to stop but now
[17:44] starting this greater sanctification
[17:46] there's the table of shewbread work but
[17:49] before that actually I was reading the
[17:51] Bible every day somewhere in here I
[17:54] started reading the Bible every day
[17:55] we'll then that's where they shoot ready
[17:58] focus in him able to read they're eating
[18:00] the Word of God every day making your
[18:02] prayers to God at that instant Psalter
[18:04] and then the menorah you know has to be
[18:08] constantly the wick has to be trimmed in
[18:10] the light and everything the light of
[18:11] God comes into your heart and all those
[18:13] things and then of course the Holy of
[18:15] Holies the one we're talking about today
[18:18] I'm staying so dear is that incense
[18:22] altar
[18:25] so Exodus 30 and thou shalt make an
[18:29] altar to burn incense upon of shittim
[18:31] wood so don't make it a cubit shalt be
[18:34] the length thereof and a cubit the
[18:36] breadth thereof Foursquare shall it be
[18:38] and secure it still be the hot there on
[18:40] the horns thereof should be the same and
[18:42] thou so overlay it with pure gold the
[18:45] top there open the sides there over and
[18:46] about and the horns throw up and also
[18:48] make unto it a crown of gold roundabout
[18:51] and two golden rings shalt thou make it
[18:55] under the Tron bit by the two corners
[18:57] that are over on the two sides what
[18:58] they'll make it and they still make
[19:00] replacement stage to bear below and thou
[19:02] shalt make the space of shittim wood and
[19:04] overlaid with gold seemed like it was
[19:06] brother Matthew or another pub somebody
[19:08] recently talked about that being wood
[19:10] overlaid with gold which represents
[19:12] humanity would overlaid with deity of
[19:14] Christ so it's a lot of shadows and
[19:17] types than there are symbols and thou
[19:21] shalt put it before the veil that is by
[19:23] the Ark of the testimony before the
[19:25] mercy seat that is over the testimony
[19:27] where I will meet with people and Aaron
[19:30] shall burned there on sweet innocence
[19:32] every morning when he dressed at the
[19:35] lamps occasional burn incense upon it I
[19:37] was thinking about him brother Branham
[19:38] talked about doing your devotional time
[19:41] the quiet time and the wee hours early
[19:44] morning before the kids start to stir
[19:46] and before everything starts to get
[19:48] chaotic if you see God at the very first
[19:50] sense every day that seems to work best
[19:52] for me it's kind of like giving all the
[19:54] tenth of your money given you know
[19:57] a tenth off the top of your mind before
[19:59] you do anything else when you get your
[20:01] get your paycheck you give him the
[20:03] firstfruits same thing with your time at
[20:05] the start of every day read your Bible
[20:07] and pray and when Aaron lighted the
[20:10] lamps and even you should burn incense
[20:13] upon it a perpetual incense before the
[20:15] Lord throughout your generations you
[20:16] show off an Australian since there are
[20:18] no burns sacrifice Breck sacrifice were
[20:20] made offering me to show you pour drink
[20:22] often though and there is to make an
[20:24] atonement upon the horns of it once in a
[20:26] year with the blood of the sin offering
[20:28] of Atomics once in the air so they make
[20:31] a ton and a pint throughout the
[20:32] generations there's no scolding to the
[20:34] Lord now this is talking about our our
[20:38] instincts how that incidence ties into
[20:40] our prayers thank somebody preached
[20:42] about these beautiful scriptures I'm
[20:44] going to share somebody recently talked
[20:46] about it I don't remember there was a
[20:49] certain man accessory called Parnassus
[20:51] insuring of the band called the italian
[20:53] banded about man who want to fear God
[20:55] with all his house which gave much homes
[20:57] the people and pray to God all the way
[21:00] he saw vision had been about the ninth
[21:02] hour of the day an angel of God coming
[21:04] to him the saving in Cornelius I mean
[21:07] looked on him he was afraid and so what
[21:08] is the Lord he said to him by prayers
[21:10] and the arms are come up for memorial or
[21:13] God
[21:17] okay and these are the basically the
[21:19] furniture pieces again the outer corner
[21:22] Court Holy of Holies and y'all know what
[21:24] all those are the revelation of hate and
[21:28] when he had opened the Seventh Seal
[21:31] There was silence in heaven about the
[21:32] space of half an hour and I saw the
[21:35] seven angels which stood before God and
[21:36] to them were given seven trumpets and
[21:38] another angel came up stood at the altar
[21:39] having a golden censer those given unto
[21:42] Him much incense that he should offer it
[21:44] with the prayers of All Saints so our
[21:48] prayers are associated with the incense
[21:50] offering upon the golden altar which was
[21:53] before the throne and the smoke dance
[21:55] and she came up with the prayers of the
[21:56] Saints tent before got out of annual
[21:58] town also I suppose this was David in
[22:01] Psalm 141 let my prayer be set before
[22:04] thee as incense and the lifting of my
[22:07] hands as the evening sacrifice now if
[22:12] you look up any sense you'll find a
[22:14] brother branham talking a lot about this
[22:17] instance where Zechariah was praying an
[22:21] angel appeared to him and it was what he
[22:22] was doing his duty as a priest offering
[22:24] incense that was in the days of Herod
[22:26] Herod the king of Judea a certain priest
[22:28] named Zacharias of the course of the
[22:30] vial and his wife was of the daughters
[22:32] of Aaron and her name was Elizabeth and
[22:35] they were both righteous before God
[22:37] welcoming all the commandments and
[22:39] ordinances of the Lord blamelessly and
[22:41] they had no child the post that
[22:42] Elizabeth was parent and they both were
[22:45] now on well stricken in years
[22:46] I came to pass that while they executed
[22:48] the priests office before God and the
[22:50] order of his force the court of the
[22:51] customer priests office his law was to
[22:53] burn incense when he went to the temple
[22:54] of Lord and the whole multitude of the
[22:57] people were without praying at the time
[22:59] of incense there again prayers
[23:00] associated with the incense offering and
[23:03] there appeared intimidation Lord
[23:04] standing on the right side of the altar
[23:06] of incense and when Zechariah saw him he
[23:09] was troubled in fear : but the angel
[23:11] said of them fear not Zechariah that
[23:13] prayers heard a Nawaf Elizabeth shall
[23:15] bear thee his son master Colin
[23:18] so now we're going to get into how to
[23:20] frame we know a few instances in the
[23:22] scripture what we're told how to pray be
[23:25] careful for nothing
[23:26] Philippians 4 but everything by prayer
[23:29] and supplication with Thanksgiving let
[23:31] your requests may not come to God so
[23:33] don't just thank god that's God for this
[23:35] asking for that but with Thanksgiving
[23:37] that's your prayer lean on God and the
[23:39] peace of God which passes all
[23:41] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[23:43] minds through Christ Jesus
[23:45] ok Luke 11 and he said unto them when
[23:51] you pray say our Father which art in
[23:53] heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom
[23:54] come thy will be done as in heaven so in
[23:58] earth give us day by day our daily bread
[24:00] and forgive us our sins for we forgive
[24:02] everyone that isn't dead to us and lead
[24:04] us not into temptation but deliver us
[24:05] from evil and if you skip on down on
[24:10] that same scripture trying to save time
[24:13] a little bit I say to you that we will
[24:18] not rise given because he is thy friend
[24:20] yet because of his importunity
[24:21] or annoyance what that means he will
[24:24] rise and give him as many as needed and
[24:26] I stand even azmuth shall be given you
[24:28] seek and ye shall find knock and it
[24:29] shall be opened in you for everyone that
[24:31] seek asketh receiveth and he that
[24:32] seeketh findeth and him anon shall be
[24:35] opened and then the very last verse he
[24:38] says if you then being evil know how to
[24:40] give good gifts to your children how
[24:41] much more shall your heavenly Father
[24:43] give the Holy Spirit to them that ask
[24:45] this prayer of the Lord's Prayer were
[24:47] always quoting if you think about it
[24:49] really it boils down to asking who the
[24:51] kingdom of God asking for the Holy Ghost
[24:53] for the new birth essentially but when
[24:56] you pray our Father in heaven Hallowed
[24:57] on name thy kingdom come his word is
[25:00] this kingdom scheme
[25:01] where the wheel which is his work
[25:03] they've done as in heaven which heaven
[25:05] consists of the work so on earth so
[25:08] order basically what we're saying is
[25:10] give us the bow a little portion we're
[25:12] going to read the study and you give us
[25:14] our little portion for today and also
[25:17] forgive us 2/3 of those who sin against
[25:21] us but essentially we're asking for more
[25:24] of God how to pray Romans 8
[25:27] likewise the spirit also helpeth our
[25:30] memories but we know not what we should
[25:31] pray as with off sometimes the original
[25:33] Noah would ask in a certain in a certain
[25:35] situation but the spirit itself maketh
[25:38] intercession for us with groanings which
[25:40] cannot be uttered and he that searcheth
[25:42] the hearts knoweth what is the mind of
[25:44] the Spirit because he maketh
[25:45] intercession for the Saints support the
[25:47] will of God and we know that all things
[25:49] work together for good and love God
[25:50] those who are called according to his
[25:52] purpose now who do we pray for I'm gonna
[25:56] have to cut off some of it Matthew 5 but
[25:59] I said to you love your enemies bless
[26:01] them that curse you do good to them that
[26:04] hate you and pray for them which
[26:05] despitefully use you and persecute you
[26:07] that you may be under your father which
[26:10] is in heaven so who do we pray for again
[26:14] 1st Timothy 2 I'm sorting their form
[26:17] that first of all supplications prayers
[26:19] intercessions and giving of thanks be
[26:20] made for all men this is where I pray
[26:23] for even Donald Trump for our president
[26:25] are saving prayers and I pray for the
[26:27] leaders of our company I work for and
[26:28] for the leaders in our kids school
[26:32] and so forth for kings and all that
[26:34] authority that we may lead a quiet
[26:35] peaceful life and all godliness and
[26:37] honesty but it's acceptable on the side
[26:41] of daughter I was there for them in
[26:42] everywhere that left hand pulling hands
[26:44] without wrath and down code we pray for
[26:48] James v there's any among you afflicted
[26:51] letter praising him Mary let him sing
[26:53] songs and sending a sick among you let
[26:54] him call for the elders of the church
[26:56] let them pray over him and want to give
[26:58] a goal in the name of the Lord and the
[26:59] prayer of faith will save the sick the
[27:01] Lord shall raise him up and if you have
[27:03] committed sins they shall be forgiven
[27:05] you confess your faults one rather
[27:07] afraid one for them that you may be
[27:09] healed the effectual fervent prayer of a
[27:11] righteous man availeth much okay
[27:15] does anybody remember who say that this
[27:17] here God started church the way he
[27:18] wanted it now he wants it the way
[27:19] started inside Joe green I want to say
[27:22] further Joe green said that no brother
[27:24] in degree Henry okay is that better
[27:26] so the mom church got started first
[27:29] Elaine wanted and I once it the way
[27:30] started so acts to go back to acts 2:38
[27:34] then Peter said and they repent be
[27:36] baptized there one of you the name of
[27:37] Jesus Christ for the mission of sins you
[27:39] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[27:40] the process is huge here shouldn't think
[27:43] that our Father David Ismael Oregon's
[27:44] took home and skip on down they glad to
[27:48] receive order to baptize the same there
[27:49] at about 3,000 souls they continued
[27:51] steadfastly and pulsed with our control
[27:53] center breaking the bread and prayers
[27:55] and fear came upon every soul and many
[27:58] signs and wonders were done by the
[28:00] apostles that's John 17 I want to close
[28:04] it off their question
[28:06] for the breaches I mean when they sprang
[28:10] for somebody had a bad spirit that close
[28:13] your eyes from the spirits out that
[28:15] person approaching oh yeah right have to
[28:18] be reverent
[28:20] but John Donne 1701 just read that your
[28:22] own time is the moment so thank you all
[28:25] [Music]
[28:45] [Music]
[28:55] yeah
[29:12] [Music]
