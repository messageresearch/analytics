to we'll rotate time about and go down into basements some of us and you know the others and things and we'll try to not be I have what you call it not being aggravating but we'll just go right on the end of the services but we'll try to abide by what we can of it keep everything in the right order amen good to see everybody this morning and we praise you you just remember wade in June is over brother Dutch started speaking for brother Dutch for this today and pressure Lord would bless them on the way back home remember brother Lewis will be bringing their services this evening one o'clock so remember that keeping in mind and why Terrence has already announced about sister Johnny they was concerned about which procedure to follow so maybe they have figured things out and got it in order and all like that but we pray the Lord would bless okay any other announcements we will just announce you know Wade will be doing Wednesday night so he can cover on over into you know the weekend I feel like turning your scriptures turn to Leviticus 23 and we will just read our scriptures and continue our thought trying to get to a position to understand father we thank you for the opportunity that we have that we can come together for at this time we can still fellowship together around thy word and we pray that Lord as the days and the times approaches of all of the things coming up on the earth that you would take care of everything be were the people Lord of all people of the world a lot of these viruses and things Lord all of that just people dying on ever hand and in order we ask you to just be with each one and got each one investor Church the people that's the little bride around the world if she endeavors for you and just have you away with each one of us we love you and we thank you as we speak your word you come and speak to our hearts in Jesus name Amen let's just read a few verses here we'll go was going to the 17th well what we'll do is we'll just read Leviticus 23 9 and then about 12 then we'll jump over to 17 okay and the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them when you be coming to the land now this is when Israel was actually already in participating and coming into Canaan the land of promise cause Canaan as the top of the baptism of the Holy Ghost so the reason I'm saying that away see then when you start making these things you'll see it says firstfruits well the firstfruits is a baptism with the Holy Ghost so this is entering into the land and when you get incoming into the land and things you do these things in ioan you'll see that it works out good see speaking to the children of Israel and said to them when you come into the land which I give unto you and shall reap the harvest thereof then you don't have to plant remember when they entered into Canaan they didn't have to plant they they gathered that year because it was already it was a time of the harvest alright so then they they were ready and they got to either the old corner of the land and when they did you remember what happened the old corner of the land is exactly what this is talking about - she's waving the different things you know together into the fruit to harvest and when it does they were allowed to eat of the old corn of the land and when they did the manna ceased the manna ceased read you Bible and as it ceased the then it went into the the deeper depth of the Word of God is the best way to say it because manna was the top of the baptism of the Holy Ghost therein Kanaan's land this is to happen and then it's coming forth telling you what to do and he says then you shall bring a sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest unto the priest and he shall weigh the sheath before the Lord to be accepted for you on the morrow after the Sabbath now when it's going to be what gonna be on the eighth day they ain't gonna be on the Sabbath then all right donar tomorrow after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it and you shall offer that day when you wave the sheaf and he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the Lord let's just drop over save time verse 17 and he shall bring out of your habitations now this is coming more into is is gathering this is the sheaf wave we'll see what that is but now the petite the people how something to participate because she's well you're gonna find out it's one person the priest goes out in waves of sheath but then it goes into the families or the people the group see and then once and you shall bring out of your habitation to wave loaves of two tents deal they shall be a fine flour they shall be baited bacon with leaven they are the firstfruits unto the Lord you may be seated Lord have his blessings to the word alright now what we want to do is this is it may not sound like it or you'd think about it but all of this is coming toward a climax of what I've been speaking on and what has been that point that the bride of Jesus Christ will be the Son of Man the Lord Jesus Christ manifested in human flesh in the last days that's her promise we'll get to that we'll get over weekend we'll get over into Revelations one where it says one standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks like under the Son of Man Girt about the paps so you coming into bride form all right so we wanted to try to bring everything over into a bride form but we've got to cover this and get it into the right place of understanding and seeing that the bride then will be the fullness of the Godhead bodily you said well that's just too much no that's not too much that's what the Bible says about us and that's what I'm doing here is taking this example of the entering into the Promised Land and when they begin you know they went into the cane and the promised land and as they did the then they didn't have to plant they they went into the time of the harvest all right and each person would take in any setup of tradition I'm not a traditional Oh a commandment from God that ever from then on every year it would be the same way so this would be the example as for to Israel to do and they're they're doing here and in it what's that the example for what the next year would be the next you know and we'll keep on going all right joy they're entering into the Promised Land then there to take us a sheath all right now I'm gonna say this the best way I can for you to understand you're gonna have to see that the the priest the high priest would would do this it was told for him to take that the priest was to take this and do it it wasn't 99 priests out there now offering for this without of the other on the first one I don't believe I believe the sheath wave was the / the priests waving that one sheath for the whole land but now from then on ever head of the family would have to bring a sheath because see here you're not talking about get you're not talking about that you planted it and then you're gonna go out and you're gonna gather it the second year and from then on that's what it is you plant your crop it grows up before you go out and gather it you take what's called the firstfruits and and you go out there and you get a handful of wheat and you take it into the priest you know and he would wave it before the Lord showing that your harvest is fixing to come all right so get what I'm talking about it for the children of Israel and all that first one it would take many many days to go through the waving in the sheath so I'm trying to show you the what I think happened was when they entered the land the high priest gathered not from ever field and all of that and it's not necessarily because it'd be tying up too much time but he would go out and he would gather that wheat that that handful and he would wave that before the Lord showing what they're to do now the next year the next year you're responsible you have to go out you have to get your sheath you have to do that take it to the priest and then he waves it this one the priest probably went out and took it because it was in to the land because that's what it said in the scripture there as we're reading them what speaking to the children in this engine when you see enter into the land which I given to you you reap the harvest thereof that you know bring a sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest unto the priest and he's your way all right so it would just be one thing to represent the whole thing but from then on it would turn out to be for you you've got to bring it take it to your priest and do it because all of that wood will tie together all right then it winds up to be same sheath that is way before the Lord it winds up being two loaves as we've said in the 17th verse er it winds up to be two loaves and we'll get to that in on end of the message because I believe that that's bringing it through the point of bride form all right no that's that's what I believe I believe when you come to the two loaves you're coming to bride form you got your sieve you've got your priests you got your offerings now you're coming to the point of the two loaves and you know that that way it would will tie together but all right now that's what we want to talk about but the main thing of what I want to talk to you about is to make sure you follow the lineup that I've been doing for months and months to talk about the bride of Jesus Christ being the son of man all right and windup being the fullness of the Godhead bodily in the bride of Jesus Christ all right now not in one member not in one doing we covered that the son of man wouldn't be one Church age it's all seven church ages the son of man comes for from there even though he's under the dispensation back gar of son of God and not manifest in that much maybe in those days but he's hitting he comes in to the son of man and you understand is coming to the maturity it's like I said about when they entered the land they were allowed to eat of the old corn of the land which they didn't plant it they didn't do anything they went out and gathered it okay so when they went out and gathered it see then they would take that and wave it before the Lord and then they could eat that and it would be called the old corner of the land and when it does your mana in reading scripture your manner that was with the children of Israel down through their journey eating each day and everything that manna ceased you'd say well why did it sees it cease because it became a stronger maturity see they entered the land you understand they went into Canaan they went out here in the wilderness running around playing about they had entered the land of Canaan all right then they go out and they see the fields ready and they say what do we do in the priest says oh no wait a minute and God said okay Moses this is what you do take the high priest and let him wave for one and then we won't stand everybody because at that time once they entered the land they didn't have the land divided so you wouldn't know what lands you're to wave your seasons on but as it went on they begin to divide the land up and set it aside for each group all right but that hopper you see when he waved that sheath before the Lord it was the showing of the harvest or the time was at hand now think about what I'm saying and if you'll study it you'll see there's seven days between this waving of the sheaf and then you get on over to the bar lives and different things and the loaves you're gonna have to put about seven days in there so what you do is it's you know maybe maybe you never raise wheat or anything like that as much or around barley or or anything but say you raise cotton or you raise corn you go out there and you plant your crop which is always a certain spot in that garden that comes before all the rest some reason for the for the we call it fertilizing or the ground that has been in the ground or something to be there there's a certain spot of that garden always with tours first all right so that's what you're talking about you go out and you don't just reach around the edge of the field and grab a sign here hip reasons no you look around over the whole field and you find a place that here is all the other things running on a good level especially with wheat and you just stand and look and especially you go out west and you stand and look and man you can just look for 10 miles and and it looks like every stalk is the same size but you got to remember there are spots in there that was a head of the others that's what I want you to get because I believe the the waving of the sheath is in representation of the first one to come to maturity and I wholly and we'll get to it and back up over it and keep saying it I believe brother Branham was the first one in our day to come to maturity now I believe that I've always taught that I've always believed he was the first one to come to maturity all right you know being the Prophet being the bringing the message and then we'll get on into the message and see that it comes to a point that there's going to be a sheaf waved in the last days now that's what we want to get to it a minute but I want to make sure you get the background foundation so you see that you see the situation you enter into the land the lands already with our maturity it's ready the high priests Moses tells him he goes out he looks around and he sees a spot that's taller than the other which is recent maturity quicker you know for some reason and the natural more fertilizer more sunlight more whatever you know more water but he goes into there and he takes a handful and he waves that before the Lord all right then they can gather I think you seven days later from the time of his waving I believe this correct would wouldn't matter but he huh there's a time between his gathering of the priests and the waving you know I'll be caught it would represent to seven churches right but here then now you can go out and you don't have any land you know it's not set aside yet for you to to have your piece of property but everybody can just go out and gather and they can cook it and you know whatever they do and that is the old corn of the land it's already matured all right your manna ceases because mana you said yeah but man it was the top of the word does the word cease no no don't get that in your ideas the the mana became the old corn or which way you said the old corn becomes a man I guess I don't know which way you won't say it but it would wind up being that that mana you know would cease away because it's coming into maturity of the old corn all right and that old corn shows adoption statue of a perfect man shows the things you are in your Christian journey because you've entered the promised land which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth and you you're offering your sheaf and you're you're doing the things that you're supposed to be doing and as it does it just keeps increasing and you come up to the old corner of the land then you can can go and just keep on traveling throughout the Word of God all right so you follow what I'm talking about all right so now that first one to come to maturity the first part of your field or garden whatever the wheat that was there the part first part of kind of maturity iris where the priest would go and get that handful and he'd go wave it before the Lord now what's he waving that before the Lord far come on what's he waving it before the Lord for to show that there's a whole field out there not to just show the the well the Lord has given us this wheat and given us this land that's a good that's real good all of those things are great but the main thing to me is when he weighs that before the Lord now you can go into the two loaves because you can take that in and cook it all right then you've got something to eat all right now you've got the old corn of the land that you're able to eat it and it becomes a part of you okay all right see then the point is what the sheath is proof that there's coming a field keep that in your mind now the sheaf itself waving you see you can argue about this with the first and that was for i believe brother branham was the first in our day to come to maturity i agree with that i believe but really the Lord Jesus Christ is the first to come to maturity because you back up back there and come into the ages and the things with this getting the point I believe it I believe brother Branham was the first one in our day to come to maturity which you know what that meant more was coming they don't mean well run around and I don't mean this wrong of people who said it you know that all God was he poured into Christ and all Christ into brother branham and brother Brown died and took it with him we got nothing now I don't agree with that I never have never never cared about that statement to me it's derogatory to the entire Bible slanderous to the Word of God to bring it in that order but I believe brother Branham was the first one right but he was wave showing that others were coming all right you want these quotes from brother Branham he said in the days of the prophets news is plural in the days of the prophets this is this day not if you and I gonna be prophets they ain't gonna new it it's in the days of the maturity all right so that's what it is see that that sheaf represents the what's coming it ain't enough to feed the whole people these it means that it's ready it means you can go to you feel now like I said they may be a seven-day period between this day that matches up to that to be just right to where it'll follow correctly on the eighth day but still it when he waves that sheath before the Lord to be accepted it means Moore's coming of the same wheat all right see that's what happened under there Pentecost go into this arising to the Sun I got about six pages in here I topped off on it but we won't get to that but you do it yourself go ahead it's the rising of the Sun go in there and study those study masterpiece steady ceding out our with a shook bringing all of those messages and begin to read them and you'll see that it all represents that there's a maturity yes thank God for the maturity of the one that brought the message in the end which is to be in this day to be delivered of an uber from according to Malachi 4 alright see brother branham was that one chief way right perfect but it meant there was more to come of the same kind we don't have to worry about whether what all you think we're all prophets well why don't you think that we're more than just garbage cans you know I mean like I've always said it like this if David if David under the blood of bulls and goats could whooping lie on the burner and a giant if he didn't needed to he could have put them all together at one time whooped all of them wouldn't make no difference right you agree with well you know what you think to do that without the baptism with the holy holy ghost what would it be he would have told Saul and then say hey y'all go on back home I'll take care of this thing myself and he could have done it under the blood of Jesus Christ but you see what I'm talking about now the first one to come to maturity sure the Lord Jesus Christ let's get the story right now and run it through the Lord Jesus Christ is the first one that came to maturity and he had a death burn a resurrection and rose up and was waived brother Brown said on the day of Pentecost over the rest what wave to show others were coming it wasn't going to be just for him it would be others to come forth of the same form of wheat alright and see bringing it into the to do that we can enjoy the old corner of the land I really enjoy reading the Word of God from where I can study it now compared to where I was you know 40 years ago or something trying to to understand the message in and listening to the things you know even back the end of of trying to understand the prophet in the way he would be talking and you'd look at things but I know what this went through see everybody preached that way even more they preach brother Branham brother Branham was waved over brother Branham brother Branham well okay no problem we got that right no problem he's the first one in our day to come to majority no problem but worse the rest of us of the wheat God if he was accepted and we know backing up putting it well brother on him and the Lord Jesus try to understand the Lord Jesus was accepted for you and I to prove that more wheat was coming all right he was the first to come to maturity he was God himself in human flesh but he's showing there's more to come think about it so you think well well I I just can't see myself in the word why not I see you in every scripture of the word he'll run around city you can't see Christ in every verse he just say Jesus now cuz that would be fleshling you get too much but he said Christ in every verse he said go back read again you missed it see we can study the Word of God that people have never thought about we could look at the 10 commandments and read them and they got him out here on the road they got him on the house on the barns they got him on the churches and done before we got it we can read that Ten Commandments and see brother Brown the cities the seals because the Ten Commandments with God in human flesh produced by what the prophets brought the word the word brought the body of Jesus Christ brought him into being all right and see we could look back at that and see that and see those things to see what was promised to come well I now if he was the fullness of the Godhead bodily why don't we believe it right we believe the Lord Jesus Christ fullness of the Godhead bodily all right and brother brother said God is not complete without you so there's got to be some parts of these things put together and where are we and the Prophet said is to be waved again in the last days from according to Malachi 4 Luke 17 31 the Lord Jesus raised up and was waved over the people showing that he was coming back in a few days he was gonna fill those people with the baptism with the holy go now you got you feel now you got you you're what you need you got the body of Christ you got the Bride of Christ you got heard then to her that she can be all it now it's like I said now I'll keep making statements cuz I want you to not to miss I don't want you to misunderstand me cuz you see you can't have the first church age and let it be this on a man you can't have the seventh church age and let it be the son of man you've got seven churches it takes to build the body of Jesus Christ right the wife the body and in doing that then there is your seed we'll get to the next one we're going to pick up the the masterpiece and seating out our with a joke and put another message behind this one but I want you to say it he then whatever he was we are right and he come he waved goodbye brother Brennan said but a few days later he came back to fill that bride with the baptism of the Holy Ghost making her what he is bringing her to that maybe not into full maturity back there now because it takes those ages to make the maturity sure we've got an age we're at a time we're overhearing in this day but we're not in lady ousia he's or whatever the world is in lady of SIA we're in goshen there was plenty of people in Egypt but the little bride was down in Goshen the children of Israel there's plenty of religious situations around the world which there's a little bride she's gonna come to maturity and be as the Prophet said no leaven among you because you got to keep that real close in your scripture because you've got one offering that goes with an unleavened bread all right you got another offering that goes with eleven in the bread matter of fact this is the one you say yeah but but but but what but brother Darwyn you you can't how no leaven the Bible says to make it would 11 do you think you've got to understand what's being done one of them is a certain way and way it's bad you can't have leaven in it because you can't have no leaven in the bride of Jesus Christ but you can how now listen to one of the best seconds but in our human flesh we have leaven in our spirit realms we have leaven this keeps messing everything up you didn't listen uh turn 11 you know what living you got living and unliving and you don't understand my wordings in this best thing on gay news gives you a good old dictionary look at you know because you see you don't there's no in cooking there's things that's cooked without living the communion bread is cooked without leaven no leaven in it to make the communion bread why because that's got that certain but here the two loaves well let's read it look what this is and he shall bring out of your habitations two loaves of two-tenths deal and they shall be a fine flour they shall be bacon with leaven they are the firstfruits unto the Lord now the firstfruits is a bride of Jesus Christ we are the firstfruits firstfruits the baptism of the holy God now the best way I can say it to put it in understanding to keep it right with me like I said there is one that's unleavened that's got that certain meaning to it that nothing can be added to it all right but then you've got some that is that is what leaven in situations that in our natural bodies and spirit realm today we still have problems and there's leaven in there that's why it's so hard for someone to understand and and one time they said something about that and I can't find this one we're talking about the two lows said brother Branham said the Tim Jews couldn't understand them two lows well I understand why they can understand why they can't understand the two lows because they've got on leaven in I mean got leaven added to it you keep running it without leaven without it eleven are you okay with all that once here you throw in one well I I'm honest I just think it's here me this world eleven is that we are that part it's our ideas no leaven better unsaid among you brings the fullness of the Godhead bodily well right no let no doctor no ideas and things but you know what leaven does livings got one good compound to it it makes it rise right you know won't be skits 111 biscuit but it ain't too good what you put eleven than that and then make it work I ain't agreeing to the point of saying that we need our ideas added to it and ho know that I want to stay with the other one but I just got that in the natural and laying aside there of thinking about me that God can come among us and take away that living and it would be all right okay now let's get to the thought now so you got it first one to come to maturity was the Lord Jesus Christ he was waved over the people on the day of Pentecost that Moore was coming not to just wave and how that no more was coming of the same thing that the chief priest was waving there's a whole field full coming and you just think about the children of Israel wouldn't that something they hate that live I mean that manna they ate to man until they got word it's tired of it and God gave them a olan things you know and killed a bunch of them because in the ways of doing about it but different times you know and here they enter the Promised Land and they look around they say Moses look at all this wheat or barley or every which one it was you know that you got a technical point between barley and wheat okay because in Ruth waiting in the it switched from the the wieder everything to the barley and that barley is used more into bacon different times okay now but listen see the children Israel they say well Moses why we do God speaks to Moses and said that's what you do since you get to high praising you telling about her and you have him together at one handful they tell him to pick the best place because he's gonna represent not no stunted growth and you know doing like we used to do I don't mean people are human you know but we were old country people we just raised cotton all right and see and raised in cotton you had what you call cotton allotments but I mean a thing to you but it did to us you had what's called cotton allotments in other words you were only allowed to plant so many acres Danny I'm sure has he'd understands it some of you others may have followed it to a little but you had Tony he old enough to remember but you you could plant that feel well then they'd come out one time and they'd say you you you got 10 10 acres you can write they come out sometimes say acreage is up this year will give you 12 acres that was good you know cuz that meant you got two more BIOS which means you've got you know more money what but the end a lot of times they come out and they say you got 10 acres you got to cut down cause you're only gonna allow you 8 acres so you got two acres now they were sensible enough to do it this away if he was going to do it with a governmental order and looked like he'd put the plow and plow it up blast something else what you could do you know you could have done that at that one they wouldn't argued with you but you know what the government was sensible enough and the people was tore you know what they're done they said okay gather all around this one place if it's bad leave it don't even try to gather it but they didn't care if you caught a few bowls you know and put over from the other side you understand what I'm saying they had their reasons for doing but they had to cut down the allotment all right so they didn't go out and they tell you say you've got two acres that's real bad out there said farmer gather what's around it and leave that what are you getting at I'm getting that's what the children of Israel when he told that High Priest he said go out among he was telling Maguire among the best get the best not getting old swiveled up wheat and stuff you know get the best and wave it because it's going to be the best and if you need to if it's got some swiveled up things they had one in here I remember I believe this in right in this writing that were you didn't gather the corners of you feel they were waves on might the other night you had the corner you didn't gather the corners oh that was left for the poor God allowed that to be done okay now let's move on okay see then the Lord Jesus Christ was the first fruit all right because he was the first one to raise showing that the rest was coming which would be the bride all right now she falls down she gets out of way she's doing things maybe that's why that live in this place there I don't know I don't understand all of that but I'm just saying down through the ages you see the bride going into the ground coming out things happening but you see God still on the scene that the whole wheel the whole field may not could have been gathered but they could still look good enough to eat down through seven churches they had enough to eat and survive as the Bride of Christ or but promised in the last days that that sheaf would be waved again not if you want it we got them here we can read it four dozen you know go into it's the rising of the Sun you got the sheath you got a maturity you got a people that's promised I will restore the years of the cankerworm pond worm locust caterpillar a promise of malachi for luke 1730 the day when the Son of Man and here you see the prophets starting out and sure he winds up being the firstfruits of them that slept not wrong now making him wrong because he we're the firstfruits we're all the firstfruits of riders Jesus Christ but yet he was special I believe he was waved over you and I I believe the prophets message let's put it that way because it says it in this writer he said the message I believe the message is what you're talking about not brother Branham it wasn't a waving of brother Branham it was the message that he brought uh-huh but now if you want to make it brother Branham just remember one thing if you make it this letter I ain't gonna argue with you about it but I'm gonna tell you one thing worst of ingathering you see your foot on that's putting yourself in a bad situation and don't know it by trying to make it some little doctrine little idea to work you could say brother Branham was this or what a cuz I heard it preached I've heard it preached brother Branham was that chief if you want to do it now where's the rest of the field you see where you've got in to the point of the the people they don't know what you way to go cuz now you're you're you're the one who's trapped i hain't trout I'm standing here with this as straight as can be I believe brother Adam was the first one to come to maturity right but I don't believe it was the one the way we talk about all of those things but he brought the Word of God he was the one of Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 revelation 10 7 he was bringing the Word of God if the message that he come to bring to come to full maturity in our day and it did then it meant more was to come alright so if it does that that gar that's what it meant now if you don't have it down you correct or the same as back there look what you got you got a back guard show that that's exactly what it was here's that chief Shawn the whole field was ready uh-huh so if brother Branham was the chief way wherever how you won of making just remember I'm trying to deal with the next stage that's the way I've always preached it and he's gonna argue with you about what you're saying brother Brandon was this frontrunner that thank God for the message he brought I believe that that's what's being waved right now his brother runs message by the true ministry in the last days to bring it forward but just remember that she's waving and get the point I said while ago cuz I stopped it the high priest went out and waved on that first original walking into Canaan but the next year you had to have your own priest dad to be a priest for you because he had to go out and take the wheat wave it then you could gather somebody had to do it somebody had to stand in your place so remember it's not just leaving one thing or one person I've never looked for to try to prove that something what that we're that we are to be like brother Branham we're supposed to have this now that no no no because that was not for us it's not for us to be that way we're not supposed to be all of those things everybody's looking at but we are supposed to be the children of God we are supposed to be the offspring of the Almighty we're supposed to be the the Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end we're supposed to be the sheath sheath he's waived over you and I to show we're going to come forth and I believe it I believe the bride is going to come forth in this last days that's why I preached it the way I did why cause Malachi 4 luke 1730 all of those things all of those scriptures we've been brainwashed one lock under the son of man revelation 1 12 and 13 who is that good run said it was the bride heard about the pile feminists see back up above dire revelations 1 and allow time to read it but if you'll read it you'll see back up above there it's speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ alright then you go through that part of the standard in the midst of seven golden candlesticks and he picks right back up and go straight to the Lord Jesus Christ and saying I'm Alpha and Omega 2 beginning in save a lot of people have said well that was brought around now he's going now you can argue when you get on over the other two towns in the book of Revelation but don't use that first one anyway because you've proven your allan because that definitely was the Lord Jesus Christ in Revelations 1 but where's he at where's he made manifest in his bride so the bride is what you're looking for so why can't you believe that the bride could be the fullness of the Godhead bodily what case you believe that the bride of Jesus Christ could be the Son of Man because she's God made manifest in another form called his bride and see whatever bread around was waved over thank god we've got the message the message was waved over us now let's get into the message and be able to to line up with that and walk in the light of the word that's all I've tried to do is just give you to see one after the other after the other coming now to bring it to see and read Leviticus sometimes read it's a rising of the Sun right get in there and read it what to be waved again to be waved again remember the descriptions are talking about Jesus nobody said it and again be careful how you using were sometimes because you know I believe the Lord Jesus Christ is back here now today just like he was in the beginning well I just don't see it open your eyes you're alive ain't you right you're alive ain't you you're kickin that you you living why don't you believe that he's here well we just haven't seen what do you want to see what does it take I believe to see not see to believe that's where I've always had this in mind 40-something years and I said the way I've been preaching it that the son of man and taking it right straight over to this council to see I don't say the wrong one but there's a certain brother your while back you know we were talking he said yeah I said I remember the first sermon I heard you preach brother Maloney he's not here he was one he's passed on he said I said brother Maloney tell me what's the first message every breeze he said a whole corn o corn he remembered that message all the way down another brother did too because that's what I was preaching back there in 72 three seventies coming up I always loved to study than Old Testament and take him show it as to what was taking place now tops and shadows pointing to the bride listen to study the message from that point bride then the word is that something impossible it is if we keep saying it that away you remember the one I gave you the other day what brother Brennan said he was talking about the bride and he said I challenge you to believe that he said and you'll see a worldwide revival and one time they speaking of son of man in there and the bride to be the son man he said but we keep rejecting it did we keep turning it down but that's my whole point of ones I see if there was a sheath that meant the field was ready he's brother branham was to see the fields ready whatever you want to go on that just remember I'm gonna fall right behind say words to feel because you don't ain't no need a word about it one little handful ain't gonna feed no two and a half million people so that's basically about what cross I mean you take one hand and he gonna boy we're gonna have to really pray about this no they could turn around and look and they could pick where they wanted to live maybe maybe that's when Joshua started with it in a different one you know or dividing the land but it was a whole this field I love to go out west I'd love to travel out there and look I like let's see what is it huh what's that big ol thing to the moon son you know sunflower okay well I see tonight I don't know if you'll crack them for me I'll be glad to eat them cuz they just ain't worth it they there's too much trouble why'd you look at every deer standing he's just covered you worry and he does that but what I love to see is that whole feel 500 acres and you just look as far as you can see all the way around you and there's no Sun fire it's you know what they do you know what sunflowers something you can always know where the sun's that house that sunflowers gonna turn it's gonna face that soon and you just think you stand down to look at it and say if I had time enough to stand here and wait I could watch them turn so gradual until you never notice that this would understand one of these reason I said you couldn't stand well what if you dish that time and watch that time taller than the Sun that to me is resourcing that to me is the opening of the word one like unto the Son of man who is that brother and he citizen bride the bride where does that come from comes from that sheath wave comes from all the way back down through there's tops and shadows and the waving of the sheath if you don't get nothing out of the message get one time if you can talk about a sheaf or even think about a sheaf just remember it means there's a whole field fool somewhere and it ain't know that you've got to wheat know the guy I've got to the onions and the garlic no that ain't that it's got to be the same thing chief ways [Music] think about it the waving of the sheaf to be waved again in the last days waved over the people the message of the hour to be waved I'm just paraphrasing right down the line from its rising the Sun she's wave showing that the maturities already there must be a coming forth of a harvest everything's getting ready but we've been 50 years brother Dale since the going of the Prophet so you had something to eat honey you had a message to feed owned it but that's where the problem with the people see they forgot the message I wanted to find out about the wheat I found out about the we defined about the sheath I find about the bride because whatever is in that sheath is representing something out to her that's coming why can't we believe that that when it's a fulfilling of the Scriptures the bride being the son of man the word alive in the age that you're living but it has to be the word coming down through all seven Church ages but it will come forth in the last part why because brother Branham was not I mentioned this the other day brother Branham was not the messenger to the lady of seal you can not run it that away brother Branham was is the messenger to the last days to take us into the change according in Leviticus 25 8 on down to verse 50 I mean verse 10 but you see that's where people can't even get to they can't even keep straight you look at the cat look at the pyramid look at it I mean you have one two three four five six seven by seven and we're still in lady of see you see these eight manifestations of God I've preached this in the finis late sixties early seventies there is eight manifestations of God but only seven church ages was seven men brother Branham was a double compound this messenger melikhaya forward looks everything they're gonna do two things one and turn the hearts of the children back the fate of our two brings a message brother Branham was compound yes he was he come down through Leo see but all he was doing in lay do still was rebuking and bringing the message of restoration then his message began to the seals opening and that makes him the eighth messenger eighth manifestations of God in seven Church ages you don't even look at appear me encounter this message in this day is to bring the church back to the original Word of God but around spent 30-something years he said preaching on the statue of a perfect man what he said the thirty something years doing that trying to get to people to see that's a perfect man was preached for to see was ever started right that's 60 to see what is 63 but you see this man in this end time had a multiple manifestation of things that was to me be made done in his time return the arts and the children back to the fathers bring the seals maybe these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the harps and the children back to the faith of the fathers why can't we believe it but well well I I guess I just can't cuz Cena you're not looking at it in the right order I'm looking at the fullness of the Godhead bodily in a bride I'm not looking for the fullness of the Godhead bodily to have been in brother branham it was never meant to be now the Lord Jesus was God himself he was the son of man remember how we brought it to the brother Brennan was a son of man none of us by ourselves can be the son of man no people I don't care who they are or what they say brother Branham couldn't be it none of us can't be the son of man the Lord Jesus Christ as the Son of Man but you put that the son of man the Lord Jesus cry in to the bride form and you got the firstfruits of the Book of Revelations you've got the part that has to be maturity come forth and you've got it worth it that can be a sheaf waved you just think about it and the little man walk out there I don't love to been there to hurt him but you know just people are just amazed at him saying thing he just said good morning and then just melt cheese I said that's great that was right because he was bringing forth his part he had to be but now what are we gonna be he said yeah but you can't expect us to be no I don't expect us to be like him by the way I expect us to be what we're supposed to be it's not meant for me to be like him I'm I'm not meant to be that he was that I'm just a little pastor of a church but I believe the bride of Jesus Christ no leaven among or get rid of her ideas I will be the fullness of the Godhead bodily she'll be the chief wave you know what comes from that the chief was waved showing there would be something coming it is the Bride of Christ the next we'll pick up on masterpiece and go through Luther Westland Pentecost and come to a statement that brought a running mate a tireless outstanding he said Mary was not to seed he said she represented the shuck okay we got him right now were is the seed if Mary was not to seed she represented to shuck worse the seed just remember whatever you come up with has got to be God in human flesh and you better go in and study the message in the earliest you know and see how much better running bragged on Mary as being I mean a super street as being Mary and Mary coming through in that time then all at once he lays a lump on us and he says Mary was not that seed said she was a carrier then who's the seed well he is okay now we're right back where we started he's the chief he's the wave he's all of those things he's the fullness of the Godhead bodily and put him in Bride well you got a field full of wheat ready to be gathered come on musician think on these things just trying to make little statements to where you'll understand to see what I've been preaching for all these years that's a bride of Jesus Christ is the son of man and then bring it right back down and put it in the Bible bring it right through the Bible and put it out in the end time that's what your prophet told and I told you something that he didn't teach Timnath if you do tell me I mean come to me your response would come to him if I'm telling you something that he didn't teach now I'm a human mistakes errors and things in speech don't worry about that we will cover that so we're all humans but so do you so you know we're all got that problem it's one of those inherited old age things with gray hair comes less mind evidently that's what happens drying up with a white hair coming pools the higher it pulls it up firmly I don't know what it does to it and and brother Kern you quit life in cousin he don't even understand so that's a lot to do with it I mean let's stand together and just think about it think on these things wave sheaf but he to be waved again but around said according to Malachi for ya know listen to one thing as I'll say it is it true that brought around I'm covering one time when he covered it like this see you've got the Old Testament Israel God came to Israel right came to his own it own received him not he went to the Samaritans which was high of Jew in hi general but he never went to the Gentiles I listen to know because this is where we could go on for hours he never went to the Gentiles right he told his disciples don't go to the Gentiles now he took one time and stopped by their or twice he dwelt with him little anyone it wasn't time for that it wasn't time for the Gentiles to come in see that was to be in the end time do you understand he returned back not in the church aging thing because those were part but in the last days you got the sign of the son of man right come on yeah much he won't have brother run him you got the sign of the Son of Man to come in this in time just showing what was taking place you have to have a messenger of that the word that was coming forth what do you understand on it now it's when he's coming to the Gentiles he's been doing for over 50 years and that's just starting from where the Prophet left us seen it at 50 backed up before then almost 60 70 80 years that he's been appearing to the Gentiles as the son of man waving the sheaf showing there would be more we come the bride's got to come forth or either we're gonna tear up the Bible and throw it away but her own said it on this arriving her son he said why polish the hubs he's talking about dynamics and mechanics he says why polish the herbs when the car won't run that's perforations and what he said was I'll polish it if he ain't got no dynamics then he says and I'll get it was probably a masterpiece but he said the dynamics is a refueling of the Holy Ghost that's your dynamics it's a refilling of the Holy Ghost I think on these things well we've got brother this is the e it's greater than you see Oh the pride is repair if remember half brother believes me bringing the messages after her in the Lord lives and all fail already now the combined i4ii that has an ear to hear the evening time here oh this is the evening time yes taken it all went back into the Old Testament taken top and shatters and seeing everything a bride is preparing now everything's pointing right down here to the antiwar seeing that little bride across and all things are ready the sacred masterpiece or a bride listen to the lesson here see not out with her shop for he died acid and listened to the work on outstanding statements when he said the seed shall not be heir with a show and I thought what I'd have turned that around the other one the other we are with the seeds what I put the title then they got thinking about one day if I put it that way I'd be wrong [Music] y'all can't be in the rapture it's not far this yo as for the shade so he was right seed shall not be heir with a show Chuck's going to the triple ICU their house right rides going in the right you're just miss just thinking pray for brother Louise for the demon father we thank you and we just ask you to goddess and keep us Lord as we go in a natural meal and bring us back together and you forgive our sins I pray that what we've said Lord has been worthy I know we didn't get it none of our notes or anything Lord because we're just trying to speak from what we have when in a hearts and and mind upon you we love you and we thank you guide us now in Jesus name you dismiss keeping that hat so near to here for you
