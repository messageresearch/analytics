[0:00] we're gonna start with Romans record
[0:03] here we go Romans 14 good shut that door
[0:07] anyway so it won't be any disturbance
[0:16] alright now when we've been on Romans 13
[0:19] we finished it up to put ye on the Lord
[0:24] Jesus Christ and make not provision for
[0:27] the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof we
[0:29] got through that now remember verse
[0:31] chapter 14 as well we kind of ended off
[0:34] that's not a chapter that's a
[0:37] continuation of the letter from 13 to 14
[0:41] excuse me and then also his his whole
[0:46] letter was put you on the Lord Jesus
[0:48] Christ and make not provision for the
[0:52] flesh to fulfill the lust thereof then
[0:55] he's continuing his thought him that is
[0:58] weak in the faith receive ye but not to
[1:00] doubtful disputations now as we were
[1:04] talking last week last Sunday him that
[1:08] is weak in the faith receive ye but not
[1:11] to doubtful disputations now that would
[1:16] be more of your conversation when
[1:20] somebody comes in new you don't want to
[1:23] beat them to death I'm saying people
[1:26] come in brand-new and the message and
[1:28] people start saying you got to know the
[1:30] seals and you got to know this yeah
[1:33] that's doubtful disputations that don't
[1:36] make them don't put doubts in their mind
[1:38] they got enough doubt in their mind
[1:40] start weak because Satan is gonna
[1:42] absolutely try his best to hinder any
[1:45] new Christian much less the other less
[1:48] older ones it's been in the way for a
[1:50] while but the younger ones are so soft
[1:55] and pliable they're their kin they can
[1:57] be swayed back and forth so Paul's
[1:58] saying look him that's weak in the faith
[2:01] receive him don't do it obviously you
[2:04] got to bring him in and him or her and
[2:06] get it you got to bring them into the
[2:07] bring them into the they're in the
[2:10] family of God they just begin to know
[2:12] their new family members but not to
[2:14] doubtful disputations that brother dig
[2:19] that by me telling he he's always told
[2:21] me that he's bruised a lot of fruit why
[2:23] because he you jump on somebody and then
[2:26] you just all with off you just don't the
[2:28] load you know let's don't look dump the
[2:30] load is what Paul sends one you're gonna
[2:32] see these new week Christians now Paul
[2:36] saw more of that than anybody because
[2:38] the way you would go around to different
[2:40] places
[2:40] setting up churches well they were
[2:42] babies even though even the great mighty
[2:46] church at Ephesus started this baby
[2:48] everybody starts at the baby it set
[2:50] forth 120 in the upper room it started
[2:53] at the faith in the fathers but see then
[2:55] they had to go out and distribute the
[2:57] gospel to babies alright so the babies
[3:00] is ones that like Paul Paul said look
[3:03] this would be careful to bring them in
[3:05] but not to doubtful disputations and the
[3:09] worst thing you can do is bring a new
[3:10] convert in and have two older people sit
[3:14] there and argue about doctrine that's
[3:17] the worst thing you can do the best
[3:19] thing to do is if let them be in the
[3:22] message for a while let them sit let
[3:24] them let them hear what's going on and
[3:26] Paul the same way because you say well
[3:28] we're talking like the message well
[3:29] Paul's message to Paul's message was
[3:31] just important as his day as our
[3:32] messages for our day because Paul had a
[3:35] message for the day and he was
[3:37] delivering that message to a bunch of
[3:40] people he would go to Antioch he would
[3:41] go to this one he would go to Asia he
[3:43] would go to all these different places
[3:44] and he met weak Christians well he
[3:46] didn't go in and and just jump on him
[3:49] about everything in the world
[3:51] no what he stayed with him the Prophet
[3:55] said he stayed with him found one guy
[3:57] that he could establish in the faith
[3:59] well let that person do the preaching
[4:01] then he moved on
[4:02] alright so that's the way we should do I
[4:05] just disagree with these people that go
[4:08] to think they have to go to India Africa
[4:10] or whatever and stay there for years
[4:12] months years you want one even you know
[4:20] with a chance of
[4:21] going to the Philippines in March we're
[4:23] going back to plowing whether it's dirty
[4:24] something you message churches well
[4:27] there's no need for me to go around and
[4:28] preach to all 30 message church but if
[4:31] you'll gather all the ministers in we're
[4:33] gonna gather them all in one place feed
[4:35] them and have a day or two seminar let
[4:37] them answer quite ask question and let
[4:40] us try to watch strengthen them because
[4:42] I want them to go back cuz it wasn't I
[4:47] think it was brother burning you know
[4:50] you come in all that brother from
[4:51] America was good what'd he say I don't
[4:53] know but he was a good brother you know
[4:54] what he be done but if you can get
[4:57] somebody in there established by Paul
[4:59] did and don't go over and argue about
[5:02] stuff go over there and stablish the
[5:04] people and then let that preacher go out
[5:08] like the one at the brother Lisa and
[5:12] Christine Brennan sister Christine run
[5:14] into that was preaching damn 70 wait
[5:17] preaching it correct and didn't even
[5:19] have a chart he's had to the Bible and
[5:22] the message book so that I don't
[5:25] understand how they could we can get so
[5:28] revelation to our own ideas because
[5:36] truthfully I believe if you leave them
[5:39] alone give them a little bit of
[5:41] encouragement give them a little bit of
[5:42] help but leave them alone let them do
[5:44] their job in their community let them do
[5:47] their job in their country rightly and
[5:53] in their language they there's always
[5:54] the land when you go overseas there's
[5:57] always a language barrier and there's
[5:59] always and maybe a preacher not so much
[6:02] but a teacher like myself that needs to
[6:05] take time you're so rushed because
[6:07] you're actually preaching to sermons
[6:09] you're preaching one then you got to
[6:12] wait on that guy to interpret to preach
[6:14] another one so you instead of an hour
[6:16] sermon you've turned it into two hours
[6:18] but you've only give them an hour's
[6:19] worth of content and I don't mind that
[6:22] but still you just don't get as much
[6:25] accomplished I don't think you to view
[6:26] if you were to sit down for two hours
[6:28] and talk to that one brother established
[6:30] the gospel they let him go and preach
[6:32] for years to his congregation and let
[6:35] that congregation what be built up and
[6:38] done like so not to doubtful
[6:40] disputations so let's just keep this in
[6:43] mind just for some simple thought that
[6:45] word it's don't disputation we will do
[6:49] that right here it means a
[6:54] distinguishing discerning or judging
[6:56] alright so in other words disputations
[6:59] is in other words you're sitting around
[7:00] talking about doctrine but he puts this
[7:04] word into it
[7:05] doubtful disputations so doubtful
[7:08] disputations mean that is what you're
[7:11] talking about something the thinking of
[7:13] a man deliberating with himself which
[7:16] means his own idea you don't want to
[7:19] have your own idea you want to just do
[7:21] like Paul says cuz watch now here here
[7:24] he's gonna explain from one believeth
[7:27] that he may eat all things another who
[7:30] is weak is herb's
[7:32] if you're vegetarian you're weak know
[7:34] what the Bible says another who is weak
[7:38] eating herbs and I'm gonna have a good
[7:41] salad today but you know what I'm gonna
[7:43] have a good big piece of meat somewhere
[7:45] in there but no look for if one
[7:48] believeth that he may eat all things in
[7:50] other words we use herbs let him not to
[7:52] eat it despise him that eateth not and
[7:56] let not him which eateth not judge him
[7:59] that eateth for God has received him in
[8:01] other words if they're both bride of
[8:03] Jesus Christ 1 what does it matter if he
[8:05] eats meat or feet if he's a vegetarian
[8:08] all right but what's he saying that he
[8:10] said well that's ok to do that but I'm
[8:14] going to tell you he was meaning in the
[8:16] spiritual also there's meat eaters in
[8:19] the gospel and they're salad eaters in
[8:21] the gospel or milk drinkers don't be so
[8:24] over forceful that you choked the meat
[8:26] down the baby and killed the baby before
[8:29] the baby has time to enjoy its milk then
[8:32] eat something and portal green peas it
[8:35] seems to feeding them still feed babies
[8:37] Oh gross
[8:38] anyway man I like these don't crush them
[8:41] up let me crush them up
[8:43] but you see what I made about it but in
[8:46] the gospel the same way you know
[8:47] somebody you have to bear with somebody
[8:49] let them let them grow up just like you
[8:51] did because you got to remember somebody
[8:53] bore with you while you were growing up
[8:56] so that's what Paul's saying now
[8:58] remember he's going to the Romans with
[9:00] this so he's trying to tell him when he
[9:02] gets there this is what he's gonna do I
[9:06] saw a movie one time about Paul it was a
[9:09] good one Anthony Hopkins played Paul and
[9:11] everybody know what the movie was about
[9:13] was Paul would go into a city and he
[9:17] would now he spent all the time but he
[9:18] would get right in with their customs
[9:20] and listen to what was going on and and
[9:22] I said he would if there was it was a
[9:25] place where they need any fish he didn't
[9:29] eat fish
[9:30] he'd go and say blessed God I'm
[9:32] officiator give me some fish no he he
[9:34] waved it around and he stayed there with
[9:37] him it showed him in the movie even
[9:39] coming in and playing with the kids and
[9:41] dancing with them and well why I mean if
[9:43] you bring a guy in and you just bring
[9:45] him in like a policeman and you start
[9:47] hammering people a lot of people gonna
[9:49] move away from them but if you'll come
[9:50] in and not judge the people that doesn't
[9:54] need strong me I know we preach
[9:59] everybody even strong me but you got
[10:01] there there has to be diversity in the
[10:04] body there's there's diversity in the
[10:07] body some people in light milk if
[10:10] they're still bribed they're right mr.
[10:14] right if they like milk they're still
[10:16] right but don't put them down but now
[10:23] remember too if you're called to be a
[10:26] meat-eater you'll find somewhere where
[10:28] to meet that and you'll you'll start
[10:30] eating meat of the meat of the gospel
[10:32] who aren't now that judges another man's
[10:34] servant to his own master he standeth or
[10:38] falleth do I understand that I I'm not
[10:40] to judge he's even branding in the
[10:42] carnal aspect of another man's servant
[10:44] I'm not supposed to look at another
[10:45] man's servant and say why is he doing
[10:48] this well if he's a servant of mama than
[10:50] I what's my business
[10:51] well they have an agreement
[10:54] with me if I have a servant in the house
[10:57] that's we saying but he's also saying
[11:00] the same thing about I like what brother
[11:02] Brennan said every Church is sovereign
[11:05] every Church is sovereign it is like
[11:07] brother Lenore said if you want to play
[11:11] tape you know they become like so my
[11:13] plan do you want to play tapes every
[11:14] Sunday afternoon and you're the pastor
[11:16] of that church there's no eye makeup
[11:19] whose before you know for what for us to
[11:22] say you can't do that there is no right
[11:24] or wrong in that aspect now I don't have
[11:26] to stick there and listen to it I can
[11:29] move I can go somewhere else to his own
[11:33] master he standeth or falleth so in
[11:35] other words with God we're all gonna be
[11:37] judged separate as individuals run gonna
[11:39] be judges agree yeah he shall be holding
[11:42] up for God is able to make him stand see
[11:45] what that were holding me made to stand
[11:49] for God is able to make him stand one
[11:53] man esteemeth one day above another
[11:55] another man esteemeth every day alike
[11:58] you see what he's saying he's giving us
[12:00] a contrast cuz some people and it's okay
[12:05] to do that some people enjoy going and
[12:10] and looking at like we went through the
[12:13] feast days and all that stuff in the
[12:17] Jewish aspect it's okay to study that
[12:20] but let's don't stay on it because we're
[12:21] not youth we get enough of the
[12:25] spirituality of the Jew part then for us
[12:27] too and you see it sometimes I I take it
[12:31] back to another message preacher but
[12:36] some I own in internet that he brings in
[12:39] this Jewish guy they do all these Jewish
[12:41] rituals I don't see any I don't see any
[12:44] profit to that and I don't look on the
[12:48] calendar and see when it's one's ID when
[12:51] it's this side and that I'm you know all
[12:53] the things like that I don't I don't
[12:55] care
[12:55] I really don't and that's what Paul's
[12:58] saying but now don't don't bash the
[13:02] person that does that they have a maybe
[13:05] they have a purpose to do that
[13:07] I just don't think that that we as
[13:09] Gentiles have anything to do with Jewish
[13:11] custom we should not we shouldn't do the
[13:15] Chanukah no but it is it is good though
[13:17] like we were talking about last night
[13:18] Bible study it is good that you can see
[13:22] that Jesus was killed on Passover
[13:24] because he was the Paschal Lamb he was
[13:26] the Passover him he had to be killed on
[13:27] Passover and he had to come he had to
[13:30] come back onto that Pentecost as a
[13:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost 50 days after
[13:35] his comes from the feast of Passover
[13:40] until the feast of Pentecost is 50 days
[13:43] this plane caught picked up Pentecost is
[13:45] 50 days so Jesus had to come back in the
[13:47] form of the Holy Ghost 50 days after the
[13:50] crucifixion three days he was you know
[13:54] Friday Saturday and Sunday hero heroes
[13:56] we were talking about the 30 to 40 days
[13:58] and then Jesus goes back and the sins 11
[14:04] days before the before the feast of
[14:08] Pentecost go that's what the Bible says
[14:09] when the feast of Pentecost was day of
[14:11] Pentecost was fully come which means
[14:13] that fiftieth day that's when the Holy
[14:15] Ghost fell burning so heated up three
[14:17] days in 11 days
[14:19] you got your thirty to forty days that
[14:21] Jesus was among the people in the
[14:22] glorified body and we're brother Ralph
[14:24] says because there's no Bible to say
[14:26] that we're gonna be here 30 40 days
[14:27] after the resurrection brother Branham
[14:29] is typing it that we're going to be here
[14:31] for 30 40 days like Jesus when he raised
[14:33] in the glorified body until his
[14:36] ascension was 30 to 40 days right and
[14:39] then brother Branham explains very very
[14:42] well instead well we didn't get to read
[14:43] it last night but I was flipping to him
[14:45] where he said the Lord knows we know
[14:49] we're gonna meet him in the air so he's
[14:52] not here physically but when those those
[14:55] Saints come he said you'll he said what
[14:58] will do is it will take that time to be
[15:01] with family and ask who made it who
[15:02] didn't make it be able to see the people
[15:04] that were going up with that's what
[15:07] brother Brown told us that that 30 to 40
[15:09] days is Jesus knows that all the
[15:11] attention won't be on him because we
[15:14] know we're going to when we take a
[15:16] rafter we know we're going to meet him
[15:17] in the air is what
[15:18] okay so we basically not go meet Jesus
[15:22] here we're going to meet him in here so
[15:23] we're looking forward to that but in
[15:25] between that time of Resurrection and
[15:27] ambani change there's going to be a 30
[15:30] 40 day period for us to get what
[15:31] acquainted with the ones that have come
[15:33] back that's what that's what the Prophet
[15:36] says so that's exactly what I feel that
[15:39] it's not going to be it's not a doctrine
[15:42] that thirty to forty days but he's
[15:44] typing it with Jesus go remember him
[15:47] when he resurrected you resurrected new
[15:48] glorified body he was seen at the road
[15:51] of a mass he was seen of almost five
[15:52] hundred brethren the Bible says so he
[15:54] was seen of a lot of people but only one
[15:57] hundred and twenty one to the upper room
[15:58] so same way with us there's only going
[16:01] to be a small group of people that in
[16:04] this age that takes that distinction so
[16:08] it's just a time there is no nowhere in
[16:12] the Bible that says we're gonna be here
[16:14] because the Bible says we shall be
[16:17] changed in a moment to Uncle benign
[16:18] because of McLaurin doesn't say you know
[16:20] nothing about dazing but we we don't
[16:23] even assume because I can't assume even
[16:25] brother Brown said we will be here
[16:27] thirty to forty days so we will be here
[16:31] for thirty to forty days to get
[16:33] acclimated with each other get our body
[16:35] changed then to see who made it see who
[16:37] didn't make it and then we're going to
[16:39] come to a place where we take them a
[16:41] physical rapture and go into another
[16:43] dimension where Jesus is how is the
[16:47] rapture
[16:51] you know fellowshipping with people that
[16:54] have gone and come back yeah but
[16:57] nobody's gonna be able to sing with you
[17:00] no matter who may have seen them with
[17:02] you
[17:02] that's the secret yeah yeah but what go
[17:07] ahead
[17:11] everybody's not gonna say it
[17:19] no they're just gonna think you're much
[17:21] more crazy than they thought you were
[17:23] before because you're talking to them
[17:24] going there and there's people standing
[17:25] here and you're standing there talking
[17:27] to them they call that they have a name
[17:32] for that what we did what we didn't
[17:39] realize last night we didn't bring we
[17:43] didn't bring this thought into bear that
[17:47] 30 to 40 days this is what I see is
[17:50] there's going to be such a worldwide
[17:53] chaotic condition they're not gonna care
[17:56] whether you stand and talk to that wall
[17:58] either California is going to sink or
[18:01] getting ready to sink series of
[18:02] earthquakes are going to happen the
[18:03] world economies go they're not gonna
[18:05] care where you are because remember
[18:09] we're not going to be hunting down our
[18:12] persecution has come where we may become
[18:14] up to that point we might not get a meal
[18:17] or two or we might have to you know give
[18:20] our life for the gospel but we'll be the
[18:21] ones that come up but yet during that
[18:23] time it's not gonna be them and there's
[18:26] not gonna be and I found a quote last
[18:27] night I'm getting away from this book
[18:29] it's a question on our mind we're
[18:32] brother I've said the graves will open
[18:33] the great listen the graves will not
[18:35] physically open you know I'm gonna walk
[18:38] out and in the funeral I mean in the
[18:41] graveyard and someone's gonna have piles
[18:44] of dirt pull back and something's not
[18:45] know that's the secret part cuz they're
[18:48] gonna come they're gonna take that glory
[18:50] they're gonna come down with that
[18:50] deokman II connect with that body you
[18:53] make it glorified and do just like Jesus
[18:55] didn't walk through wall they just don't
[18:56] come
[18:56] pure moments okay so that is the secret
[19:00] part it is a secret company you can tell
[19:12] everyone but if they're not bright and
[19:13] if they're not born again they're gonna
[19:15] think you're an idiot
[19:17] because they're not gonna be able to see
[19:19] it no only the bride will see each other
[19:24] only the born-again believers know foods
[19:26] birds and rest of the world they're not
[19:28] born again so they have nothing to
[19:29] connect with see we're talking about
[19:31] people and places it's all the Holy
[19:36] Ghost inside you use your theophany if
[19:38] you're born again then it's just as
[19:40] eternal as God is already now somebody's
[19:42] not born again they're not eternal that
[19:44] to me that's the secret part is that
[19:47] even the foolish virgins and I was
[19:49] looking up that quote I find it later on
[19:51] we're underground simpler Christian
[19:53] people so-called plan people after the
[19:57] rapture takes place we'll still think
[19:58] they're getting saved now they came so
[20:01] who's doing that the devil is doing that
[20:03] the devil's making what's the devil do
[20:05] it now he's making people believe
[20:07] they're safe when they're not so that's
[20:10] the same thing and then then brother
[20:12] Branham also said he said he said some
[20:14] people will be standing like I said last
[20:16] night they'll be listing a lot of
[20:18] disrespect for happen I thought this was
[20:20] supposed to happen I thought this was
[20:21] supposed to happen
[20:22] he said that smell still small voice
[20:24] will speak and say you missed it it's
[20:29] already happened now that may be to the
[20:31] food see that would be the meat of the
[20:32] foods virgin because nobody else that
[20:34] can he's not gonna go to the drunk in
[20:37] the bar room and say hey buddy you
[20:39] missed it now he's going to go to the
[20:40] religious group they come to
[20:42] sanctification they made their self pure
[20:46] in in their spirit realm but not in
[20:48] their soul right and their foolish
[20:51] version so he's gonna come with them say
[20:53] hey you missed it something brother
[20:54] Brown said they would have to give their
[20:56] life in the tribulation period for what
[20:59] they believe because there is going to
[21:01] be a group of people that's going to be
[21:02] killed during the
[21:03] period that our foolish virgins they're
[21:06] going to have to give their life for
[21:08] even what they stand for
[21:10] even in sanctified condition so there's
[21:13] that group of people that's going to
[21:17] probably let me finish your your
[21:20] question they won't be able to see the
[21:24] dead Saints well calm wycombe dead
[21:26] Saints are not dead the Saints we can't
[21:29] see right now then we're going to be
[21:31] able to see there is insane
[21:34] if they're not gonna if they're going to
[21:35] be here and we're going to be able to
[21:36] converse with them then the foolish
[21:38] version is going to be so close because
[21:40] remember they were right there saying
[21:41] give me some of that oil they were right
[21:44] there with the five wives and foods were
[21:46] not even in two buildings they were in
[21:47] the same building basically the same
[21:50] place because there was five wise and
[21:52] five foolish they were in the same place
[21:54] they weren't one in one country and one
[21:55] another they were wearing the same place
[21:57] because what happened is when the
[21:58] foolish realized the wives we're getting
[22:00] ready to go they what give us some of
[22:03] your own they knew where to go to give
[22:05] us some of your also they gonna be so
[22:06] close that they're gonna be able to
[22:09] maybe even feel the pull or feel what's
[22:12] going on or even to leave in a foolish
[22:15] virgin if if your foolish virgin you got
[22:18] enough of God in you to know that
[22:19] there's supposed to be a rapture a
[22:20] chatter of Resurrection the change in a
[22:22] rapture so it's what I mean not to the
[22:25] whole world but to that foolish virgin
[22:27] maybe that's when God will say you miss
[22:29] them and but maybe he'll comfort say
[22:32] look I got to put you through
[22:33] tribulation because you didn't exactly
[22:35] accept everything you got but you're
[22:39] gonna have to die for me and to me
[22:41] that's great I mean that's wonderful and
[22:44] get it tomorrow
[22:48] yes they are virgins they're virgins
[22:50] because they're burned into something
[22:52] they're not they're not polluted by the
[22:53] world so they'd be real honest with you
[22:58] most of them is gonna be people that
[23:01] thinks they're right of this message so
[23:05] the preachers can't preach any birth the
[23:06] way it's supposed to be preached so
[23:07] they're gonna be food that's why you
[23:10] call them foolish virgins okay now that
[23:13] we got all that subject ain't Carol
[23:15] let's get back to what we were talking
[23:15] about
[23:16] one man esteemeth one day above another
[23:19] another esteemeth every day alike let
[23:22] every man be fully persuaded in his own
[23:24] mind so in other words have a conviction
[23:29] convinced our conviction in your own
[23:33] mind he that regardeth the day regardeth
[23:37] it unto the Lord and he doesn't guard if
[23:40] not the day to the Lord he does not
[23:41] regard it he that eateth eateth to the
[23:44] Lord
[23:44] free giveth God thanks when we should
[23:47] pray over our food even God thinks and
[23:49] he that eateth not to the Lord he eateth
[23:52] not and giveth God thanks for none of us
[23:55] liveth to himself and no man dieth to
[23:58] himself
[23:59] no worries you're not your own gun
[24:02] you're not you're gonna you're living by
[24:04] principle and you're gonna die by
[24:05] principle natural or spiritual because
[24:08] people are gonna die spiritually they
[24:11] don't accept God with what they got to
[24:13] do they have to turn down die right for
[24:16] whether we live we live unto the Lord
[24:18] and whether we die we die unto the Lord
[24:21] whether we live therefore or die we are
[24:24] the Lord's for to this in Christ both
[24:30] died and rose and revived that he might
[24:34] be the Lord both of the Dead and the
[24:36] living so that puts everything let's see
[24:40] what they are they're lived again you
[24:45] come across did he die rose and I stated
[24:47] last night and go back what we were
[24:49] talking about the resurrection and
[24:51] brother Dale was talking about Satan
[24:53] impersonating the resurrection he can do
[24:57] that the way he can impersonate the
[25:00] resurrection is how we're going to see
[25:03] the resurrection of people coming here
[25:05] and glorified bodies but who's to say
[25:07] that God will not be still raising the
[25:10] dead of people just not in glorified box
[25:14] difference then one of me I guess not
[25:17] anyway you do okay some do some don't so
[25:20] for those adult will go explain so what
[25:23] happens is we're gonna be standing we're
[25:26] gonna see the dead Saints walk in there
[25:28] glorified bodies they're gonna be able
[25:29] to mmm their characteristic is they can
[25:32] vanish they can reappear they can walk
[25:33] through the wall but they're not going
[25:35] to be hindered but now because remember
[25:38] brother Brown said that God's the one
[25:42] that raises the dead no problem with
[25:44] that and Satan can't do that but there
[25:47] can be an impersonator that can raise
[25:49] the dead but have a false doctrine yeah
[25:54] absolutely
[25:54] the prayer is the prayer to God to raise
[25:57] the dead so if we raise somebody
[26:01] physically here's what I'm saying it
[26:03] here we are in the church and we see the
[26:05] dead Saints come among us then this
[26:07] other church comes running in and says
[26:09] we've had three people raising them
[26:11] today there's a difference there that
[26:17] one they're talking about it's not
[26:18] resurrected then they got resurrected
[26:21] and they're going to die again they
[26:22] didn't come back in the glorified body
[26:24] they came back just like Lazarus in the
[26:26] regular body everybody got that
[26:27] okay there is no comeback in their
[26:30] normal body but what's to say that Pete
[26:33] the people over here go and say well
[26:34] we've got part of the resurrection tell
[26:36] you well then you have to buy their free
[26:38] fuel no best thing to do is is grab them
[26:40] carnally like my daddy's Karl and grab
[26:42] the person is going against the wall if
[26:46] he goes through it
[26:47] it's glorified maybe no you probably
[26:50] need to be pray for again if I got that
[26:57] say man but drive them in God can raise
[27:03] the dead now the only thing is is you
[27:06] have to look at the fruit it bears you
[27:08] look and see if that resurrected persons
[27:10] he resurrects back in his regular body
[27:12] that's not a glorified resurrection
[27:14] that's not the resurrection we're
[27:15] talking about resurrection worked on
[27:17] about is that person will never die
[27:19] again when a person walks back into the
[27:21] end of this dimension
[27:23] he's is glorified as Jesus was when he
[27:26] come out of the grave so remember that
[27:28] but also remember like said that people
[27:30] like Lazarus and many people that were
[27:32] raised Jairus his daughter all those
[27:33] people were physically raised from the
[27:35] dead but they were raised back into
[27:37] their fifth
[27:38] condition there's another thing you're
[27:39] going to be able to tell the difference
[27:40] is when that person is truly resurrected
[27:43] in a bride rapture they're not old when
[27:48] you break forward something later what
[27:54] similar saying that if you resurrected
[27:58] yeah absolutely
[28:01] yes yes unless he's bright and takes a
[28:04] body change but we we know that he's
[28:06] probably gonna pass on these older nice
[28:08] he's not I don't even know that he's a
[28:11] believer if he believes he got ready
[28:12] from the dead but see you don't have to
[28:13] be a believer to get ready to be raised
[28:15] from the dead I would say a lot of
[28:17] people list that or not a lot but
[28:21] several people maybe in the whole world
[28:22] has been resurrected that's not
[28:24] Christian that that has no the one y'all
[28:27] did do I want it y'all pray far right
[28:34] Randall that's what he's done with
[28:35] Hubble yeah yeah um no he's in this one
[28:39] I mean he's not he but there's no
[28:41] stipulation when it comes to healing but
[28:43] you got to keep Christianity and healing
[28:45] and and and glorified body all that
[28:48] needs to be separated cuz it's not in
[28:50] one big just because Randall was
[28:53] resurrected from the dead has no bearing
[28:56] on his salt it just raised him from the
[28:59] dead he was out of his body and then we
[29:02] called his buyer that brother Dale
[29:03] called his body bite and there he was
[29:05] called his soul back to the body within
[29:07] my hand but when he do that then then
[29:12] you have to go the next step be a
[29:14] Christian believe the message early I
[29:17] worked it take a body change see what
[29:19] I'm saying so you can't just lump
[29:20] everything together and say well just
[29:22] cause you a ray from the dead means
[29:23] you're going in Iraq no I had zero
[29:25] effect on anything but bringing you back
[29:28] into this world and what it may do is it
[29:30] may bring you back into this world to
[29:31] give you another opportunity to be saved
[29:34] remember what brother Brown said about
[29:36] that girl right and he said I thought
[29:40] pronounced her healed and she died and
[29:42] brother Brown see I
[29:43] he owed me an explanation I don't think
[29:46] I'd ever say that
[29:47] but he's 20 said he see God you owe me
[29:50] an explanation but you know what he said
[29:51] he said he let me steal over it for
[29:53] three months never told him nothing but
[29:56] about three months later he come to him
[29:59] and said she was supposed to die back
[30:01] there and that whatever that and
[30:02] drowning accident of something he said I
[30:05] gave her another chance to come to me
[30:09] and she did and now she's going home so
[30:11] to me that's grace absolutely
[30:15] all this was grace anything you still
[30:17] this is Grace it's all grace of God
[30:20] cuz he said they're both the dead and
[30:22] living still the Lord of the Dead am i
[30:24] living yeah he's Lord of everything when
[30:28] he stands at that white throne judgment
[30:29] all that's gonna be standing in front of
[30:31] him is dead basically spiritually dead
[30:35] yeah and he's going to pass judgment but
[30:38] he's gonna also tell him look I came to
[30:40] you at a certain day I'm telling you
[30:42] that's the way I see it God's gonna say
[30:44] I gave you a day time and he'll give him
[30:48] the hour I came to you and you don't
[30:51] want that person going one can know that
[30:53] and he'll go that's correct
[30:56] he'll know right then that he turned it
[30:59] down and he's done and Oh heavenly days
[31:03] so anyway he's Lord of the Living Dead
[31:06] in the living but one of us now judge
[31:09] thy brother or one us outset acknowledge
[31:13] despise at nought thy brother for we
[31:17] shall all stand before the judgment seat
[31:19] of Christ now hold on right there that's
[31:24] the same thing what we've been talking
[31:25] about
[31:26] you can't take general resurrection
[31:27] resurrection of the bed and glorified
[31:30] body resurrection you can't put them
[31:32] three together they're three totally
[31:34] separate things same way with this we
[31:38] are not going to stand before the white
[31:39] throne judgment so you can erase that so
[31:43] there is a judgment of the deeds down
[31:45] the body he'll cover it later on I don't
[31:47] think in here but we all stand before
[31:49] the judgment seat of Christ but you know
[31:51] what you and I stand right now this is
[31:55] our judgement seat
[31:58] but not your soul your soul can't be
[32:02] judged it's judged in Memphis born-again
[32:07] you can't be judged it was judged in
[32:09] Christ so we all will stand before the
[32:12] judgment seat of Christ of Christ for
[32:15] his written as I live saith the LORD
[32:17] every knee shall bow to me and every
[32:18] tongue shall confess to God so we're all
[32:22] gonna give up a judgment the things we
[32:24] did good or bad have to either get rid
[32:30] of them here or Karam over there one of
[32:33] the thing but it's not gonna be whether
[32:35] you gonna be bright or not if you're
[32:36] already bright he can't take you back
[32:38] out of judgment we judge you there's no
[32:41] such thing that's why it will study the
[32:45] law of this land
[32:46] you know what double jeopardy means
[32:49] double jeopardy means you cannot be
[32:51] tried if you're found innocent for
[32:54] murder of a certain person you can never
[32:59] be tried for that again that's been
[33:03] forever you know where they got it from
[33:04] they got from the Bible you can't be
[33:07] judged twice the only judge one time for
[33:09] one thing yes have you killed another
[33:12] person yes but now for that you can't
[33:15] bring that back you can't even bring
[33:17] that back out never it's a lot of times
[33:18] they'll bring something up enough and
[33:20] the judges they strike that from the
[33:22] record it won't it won't be recorded now
[33:25] good lawyer though will say that you
[33:27] know and it'll be planted in somebody's
[33:29] mind you know but remember we got a
[33:34] judge we got a jury and we got a
[33:37] prosecuting attorney and a defense
[33:41] attorney that's the same person so and
[33:45] he can't forget because it was it will
[33:48] be brought up in a time and then he but
[33:50] he said I don't remember that coming up
[33:52] in court thank God cuz it's in the Co
[33:55] forgive when it's never to be remembered
[33:57] yeah that's why we don't have sin in our
[33:58] soul we don't have seen we're not
[34:00] sinners
[34:01] that's all we're not and we're sinners
[34:04] in our spirit realm
[34:08] all right we're saying some experiment
[34:11] that's all kind of work on
[34:13] everything's your bow to me and every
[34:15] tongue shall confess to God so then
[34:17] every one of us shall give account of
[34:19] himself to God let us not therefore
[34:21] judge one another any more but Judge
[34:25] this rather that no man put a
[34:27] stumbling-block or an occasion to fall
[34:29] in his brothers way now that's the whole
[34:30] summation of of 1 through 12 he's some
[34:34] he's summarizing this in verse 13 the
[34:41] guy wants to eat me
[34:43] my brother Dale said do you want to cook
[34:45] for Christmas train don't complain that
[34:46] the ones that don't the one that don't
[34:48] don't complain once if you just will
[34:50] leave it alone then it's not therefore
[34:52] judge one another anymore
[34:54] but Judge this rather that no man put a
[34:57] stumbling-block or an occasion to fall
[34:59] in his brothers way just like sit right
[35:00] here
[35:01] he just weakened of faith don't set her
[35:05] out that's what we did I said we all of
[35:09] us from 1965 to the end of the 80s and
[35:14] maybe close to the 90s and probably
[35:16] still now we've argued over different
[35:21] things of the message how can you argue
[35:24] over something that's pure and perfect
[35:25] you can't the way you can Vicky we're
[35:28] not supposed to they already know her
[35:31] hair and dress this TV don't do this
[35:34] don't you take kids out of school keep
[35:36] the kids in school don't do this do that
[35:37] don't that's doubtful disputations
[35:46] I mean another preacher was talking on
[35:49] the phone the other night he had heard
[35:54] me online when we were talking about
[35:55] prayer lines and stuff and to me that's
[35:58] what's hurt us and he agreed that's
[35:59] what's killed us if it were depending on
[36:02] somebody else to pray for us when you
[36:05] got to do it yourself you guys got to do
[36:08] it yourself you got pray for yourself
[36:12] this Catholicism because what is the two
[36:16] spirits in the framework of the church
[36:18] it's not Catholicism and random ism it's
[36:24] what I'm preaching the seals it's the
[36:26] dark horse or the colored horse and the
[36:30] white horse is two white dog in the
[36:31] black dog and the problem is it's like
[36:34] brother Brown called
[36:35] laying on the pan even palms going to
[36:37] cover in a little while we're going to
[36:38] read it later on in the scripture where
[36:40] he says don't delay all names
[36:42] he even said that we got to come from
[36:45] that what our problem is we have
[36:47] depended on it it's been our crutch for
[36:49] 40 years
[36:52] you don't take a body change going to a
[36:55] prayer line you might get healed you
[36:59] might get saved but you're not gonna get
[37:00] a buddy James going through a prayer
[37:01] line you're gonna change what's inside
[37:04] you is gonna change your body
[37:07] brother the old normal a his hands on
[37:09] you as mighty as we know is mighty we
[37:12] know what God is he's never gonna lay
[37:15] his hands on you and say your body's
[37:16] changed he can't do that that is not his
[37:18] purpose no that will never happen
[37:23] that's right
[37:25] that's right but you got to overcome
[37:27] yourself he that overcometh that didn't
[37:30] save the group that overcoming brother
[37:33] bill is going to cover that he that
[37:35] overcometh in other words he she eats
[37:37] like he got a stomach tube right so it's
[37:39] she and eventually we overcome these
[37:42] things that's why we don't we don't
[37:45] dispute on somebody they can't overcome
[37:47] this we pray for them sure and they pray
[37:50] for you because everybody's got I've got
[37:52] a weakness that maybe you'd look at me
[37:54] and say how silly but it's mine and I
[37:57] got to deal with it I like it your
[37:59] weakness and your weakness may be
[38:00] something so frivolous that everybody
[38:02] kind of giggles it but you shouldn't do
[38:03] that you need to help them if that's
[38:05] what you got overcome listen he's an
[38:09] overcoming brother Ram said what it's
[38:12] not what you overcome it's how you
[38:15] overcoming all right so there's no name
[38:17] there's not a list of no that's how you
[38:21] overcome it dude Jesus Christ I know and
[38:25] then persuaded by the Lord Jesus that
[38:27] there is nothing unclean of itself now
[38:29] he's heading back to what he was talking
[38:32] about because I remember now Paul's a
[38:35] Jew he's fixing to go to Rome when she's
[38:37] Gentiles but Paul's at you and the Jews
[38:40] don't need clovenfooted animals and all
[38:42] that stuff that they told them in the
[38:44] New Testament not to eat even when God
[38:47] came to Peter remember when the she come
[38:50] down and all the unclean beasts were in
[38:52] that vision that thought Peter had when
[38:56] he was getting ready to go to the
[38:57] Gentiles members and an angel says eat
[39:00] these Peter says I've never eat them
[39:02] never I've never touched anything like
[39:04] that
[39:05] and the angle says no amen there's
[39:07] nothing wrong with this in other words
[39:09] you're fixing what Peter's saying is I
[39:11] never touched him Gentiles they think I
[39:14] did things in Joker's are they they're
[39:16] savages they're they're just nations of
[39:18] of illegitimate people and then the
[39:21] angel comes up and says well you're
[39:23] fixin to go to because you're going to
[39:25] open the door and then this man named
[39:27] Paul is gonna step in and he's gonna
[39:29] take over but Peters wanted open the
[39:32] door to the Gentile going into the
[39:34] Gentiles and Peter's like
[39:35] you're not talking about eating cows or
[39:38] my pigs and you thought about going to
[39:40] the pig people yeah we thought about
[39:43] going to feed people there's nothing
[39:46] unclean of itself but to him that
[39:47] esteemeth anything to be unclean to him
[39:50] it is unclean but if thy brother be
[39:52] grieved with thy meat now walkest thou
[39:56] not charitably destroy not him with thy
[39:59] meat from whom Christ died in other
[40:00] words you heard one thing spiritually
[40:04] the same thing you can't feed a baby
[40:08] deep on the steak or ribeye steak you
[40:14] might can chop it up a little bit feed
[40:17] him a little at a time but he's gonna
[40:19] choke eventually so when you when I I
[40:25] guess when I go somewhere that's my
[40:28] whole concern is don't let me choke the
[40:31] people now a man died a long time ago my
[40:34] first part of them like brother dick
[40:35] said I breathe a lot of fruit but now
[40:38] you're trying to be you try to be
[40:40] charitable to everybody in the
[40:41] congregation you don't try to just well
[40:45] if I get it they get it they don't they
[40:46] don't know you you know take your baby
[40:51] and then just set your baby over in the
[40:52] corner when it's born and so well you're
[40:54] going to get you are getting made or you
[40:56] just gonna die no you can't do that you
[40:57] go go and give it some milk then you
[41:00] give it some of them old ground-up green
[41:02] peas but now apricots and where do you
[41:07] see that's play my part I love it I
[41:09] still am as a precaution when mother
[41:11] feel that feed Anna comes I'm 13 years
[41:14] older so we all kind of raised down a
[41:15] mama I kind of urge her goodbye because
[41:18] extra apricot baby food comes I love
[41:22] them matched up apricots now the the
[41:24] peas she could have not bought one of
[41:26] them and it's a started on now but she
[41:28] still bought them anyway and but now
[41:30] they may have a cost I was a little
[41:32] giant if I could go get me a little if
[41:35] he look down the would she to found the
[41:37] empty jars no doubt
[41:39] huh she's wondering where all the
[41:42] apricots went there's 25 25 cans of
[41:46] green peas but hey because we're going
[41:50] that's why I will same way in the gospel
[41:52] you have to be careful everybody's
[41:56] different in the congregation look to
[41:59] him that esteemeth anything to be
[42:00] unclean to him it is unclean
[42:01] but if I'd rather be grieved with thy
[42:03] meat now walkest thou not charitably
[42:06] destroy not him with uh meat from whom
[42:08] Christ died let not then your good be
[42:12] evil spoken up alright we have enough of
[42:18] that so just be careful with it for the
[42:21] kingdom of God is not meat and drink but
[42:24] righteousness and peace and joy in the
[42:27] Holy Ghost for he that is in these
[42:29] things for he that for he that in these
[42:33] things service Christ is acceptable with
[42:35] God except we've got improved of men let
[42:39] us therefore follow the things which
[42:40] make for peace and things wherewith one
[42:42] may edify one another now he's talking
[42:44] about spiritually edifying spiritually I
[42:47] mean frame me for me destroy not the
[42:50] work of God all things indeed are pure
[42:53] but it is evil that that man who eateth
[42:56] with the fence in other words don't cram
[42:58] it down stroke it is good neither the
[43:01] flesh nor drink wine or anything where
[43:03] Bilaam brother stumbleth or is offended
[43:04] or is made weak past our faith he's
[43:08] asking a question have it to thyself
[43:10] before God so understand before it's an
[43:14] individual affair with God we grow up
[43:15] this time to a perfect man as a total
[43:17] individual we are not doing that as a
[43:19] collective group it's individuals all
[43:22] right happy is he that condemneth not
[43:25] himself in that thing which he allows a
[43:30] man just be just don't condemn yourself
[43:33] and you know if you like to drink milk
[43:38] that's good but now our age calls for
[43:40] more there is more than milk there was a
[43:42] time when maybe you only got milk but
[43:45] when you see there's more meat than you
[43:47] need to grow up and go into the meat
[43:49] part but don't consume condemn
[43:51] if you drink a little bit of milk every
[43:53] once in a while or ain't gonna bread
[43:55] milk couple days ago but now I don't
[43:59] have it all the time I just found some
[44:02] corn bread somebody hid in the back of
[44:03] the fridge better I like corn bread
[44:06] mmm but if you don't like bread milk
[44:09] don't don't give me a me for lacking one
[44:11] bread milk you understand what I'm
[44:12] saying it's same way the gospel don't
[44:14] condemn me for for liking the deep
[44:16] things of God when you don't I shouldn't
[44:17] condemn you but I shouldn't - you that
[44:20] there is more we'll see we guy there's a
[44:22] fine balance in about we must didn't -
[44:24] you that there is more to have besides
[44:26] milk cuz you know if you put in a room
[44:28] and all you got speak two cans of milk
[44:30] I saw her you know to drink if somebody
[44:33] walks in and you're about 25 and you're
[44:34] still drinking milk you notice of my
[44:36] waltz in this is what Dan what kind of
[44:38] state thank you rib eye medium rare I
[44:43] like it see I can meet him right
[44:45] me and right okay something I can meet
[44:48] you but anyway doesn't matter but you
[44:49] bring that in and go hey taste this now
[44:51] if you say no I just I love my milk
[44:54] there's something wrong with you at 25
[44:56] years old you need to take a bite now
[44:58] when you think about that steak what
[44:59] you're gonna do you're gonna throw the
[45:01] milk out
[45:01] Youkilis 30 today same way in the gospel
[45:04] he they doubted this down if he eat
[45:07] because he eateth not a faith so so
[45:11] what's his whole summation to lift but
[45:13] whatsoever is not of faith is sin all
[45:15] right let's go will spleen a little more
[45:18] back up a little bit
