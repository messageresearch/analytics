[Music] i want to see you amen you want to see him this afternoon aren't you just happy to be a christian all right my this day has been set up really good with the brother aaron's sunday school lesson and then the service this morning and all the musicians aren't aren't you just thankful to have musicians like this [Applause] it almost reminds me you know when when moses was given instruction to build the tabernacle of the of the lord and he began to tell people how to build and it just everybody just began to fall into place and knew exactly what they were supposed to do like a well-oiled machine just thank the lord to be in his house this afternoon this afternoon i want to speak to you from a little a little scripture in psalm chapter 42. if you want to go ahead and turn there and the brothers could pull that up and and just take for a topic thirsty souls because i know we got a lot of thirsty souls here this morning or this afternoon and a lot of people that that are maybe over seeking to overcome something need something in their life and so that's my prayer this afternoon is that something that will be said will help help you to encourage you and give you strength to overcome in this hour so let's just go to the lord in prayer well god we're so thankful lord to be able to gather together around your word lord and to be able to look into these things lord and i pray god that you'll come upon these treasures lord as we read them lord jesus and just quicken them to our hearts and lord we just invite you into the building and lord we know that the invitation will be accepted because we already know that you're here walking among the pews lord jesus we feel your presence lord and we know that you're here with us and lord we we we know that because not just because we feel something but because that we have a promise that we look to that where the twos and threes are gathered together in your name that you'll be in their midst so we know that you're here with us lord and we just ask lord that you'll bring the word that it won't just be some education that we're we're sharing this this afternoon but it'll be the quickened power of your word lord to change people's lives the lord to give them overcoming power in this hour that we're living in we ask lord jesus that you'll just come among us lord and do these things that we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen so psalm chapter 42 starts like this and verses verses one to four i'm just going to read down to verse four it says to the chief musician mascule for the sons of korra as the heart paneth after the water brooks so panteth my soul after thee o god my soul thirsteth for god for the living god when shall i come and appear before god my tears have been my meat day and night while they continually say unto me where is thy god when i remember these things i poured out my soul in me for i had gone with the multitude i went with them to the house of god with the voice of joy and praise with a multitude that kept holy day you can be seated the lord had his blessing to his word now brother branham really loved this this this chapter of psalm 42 we know that he took a lot of sermons out of this chapter he took deep calleth to the deep out of psalm 42 and he took all of the just about all the sermons he preached on thirst out of this chapter psalm 42 and when he when he would preach this he would explain that to kind of set the stage that that david was you know he was an anointed king he had been anointed for a purpose and then god god allowed circumstances to kind of take hold and saul ran over ran him out into the wilderness and he was running away from saul and he found a little cave the cave a badulum that he was he was hiding away in and a lot of the a lot of the psalms that he wrote came from that little cave that he was hiding away in and in this particular story brother branham describes that he was down in that cave and he looked down toward bethlehem and he said maybe when he maybe when he wrote that song that it was a hot day and the heat of the day maybe you could look imagine him looking the 15 miles down to bethlehem and the shimmering heat over the desert as he looked down and saw that phil that bethlehem had been taken over by the philistines that they had garrison that place and the thing that he was supposed to be the king of the thing that he was supposed to be ruling over had been taken over by the enemy and he looked and he maybe he thought i'm supposed to be king over that and one day one day i'm going to be a ruler over that but now i'm in this cave and you see god god brings us through situations like that where you if you look through the lives of all these heroes of the faith where they go through hard times and they go through struggles and things i want to maybe put maybe put a little statement in your mind this afternoon that songs are written in caves that maybe this song of your life is going to be written in a cave that you're going through maybe the cave of some kind of struggle and and songs are written and this song was written in a cave a cave of of of torment and and and david wondering what what was going on in his life and you see something something began to well up within him that that all the things that he could see could not quench the thirst that he had but there was a thirst within him a thirst that none of that nothing of this world could quench but there was a thirst for god and you see a lot of times it takes god god's got to put put us into a situation of distress to get us a place to a place where we realize the thing that we're really thirsting after brother brandon said david saul hated him and desired to kill him and and you know you think about all these heroes of the faith that jeremiah was was was buried in that whale was thrown in that well and joseph was hated of his brethren and jesus was crucified of the very people that he was sent to save crucified of them and and you see everybody everybody is dealing with something and down under underneath maybe the things that you see as people are coming in church everybody's got their own personal struggles you're dealing with something you're in other words you're thirsty and so i i want to maybe put that in your mind this afternoon and maybe that'll change the way that we deal with one another a lot of times maybe that'll change the way because every you know you know my my daughter she works at a at a um at a uh department store and you know she'll we'll talk about people come through the register and and they'll be you spiteful and angry and a lot of times hateful and they'll they'll argue be argumentative and things but everybody's dealing something with behind the scenes you don't know whether they're having spousal problems or whether they're dealing with cancer or where they're well you know zach used to work at ingles and this guy would come in every day and he would go back to the milk section and he'd just pour milk out and say i'm not going to buy it and do you don't know what's going now that's a that's a very angry thing to do it's something that you wonder what why would somebody do that but you don't know what is going on behind that person's life what it is it's thirsty souls thirst people are thirsting for something they're thirsting for something and sometimes it takes crossing the path of somebody that knows what you're thirsting for and so this afternoon maybe i want to spend some time to identify the thing that you're thirsting for maybe you haven't realized what that is yet maybe you're going through life wondering what that thing is that you're thirsting for and haven't real haven't recognized that the only thing that can quench that holy thirst that god has given you is god himself now now you know you see everybody everybody's going through work pressures and and unexpected life events and a lot you know sometimes even children children can cause pressures and when you're wondering you're wondering who are your children going to marry are they like isaac and rebecca are they going to marry are your children jacob and he's all going to marry somebody from down in the land somewhere that they don't need to be married you begin to wonder what what are they going to get the baptism in the holy ghost they begin to wonder and you see then all these pressures begin to build up and that's when you need to turn to the one that can quench that thirst instead of worrying about it instead of fretting about it you know maybe i could give you a little bit of life advice the best life advice you could have is when you want to see your children come to the lord and when you want to see something take place in your home is to just take your hands off of it because as long as you've got your hands on it god can't do nothing but if you'll take your hands off of it and let god go to work something will take place [Applause] and you think you think many times well the christian journey is supposed to be a fly a flowery bed of ease where we come to church and everybody's just wonderful with one another and and everything's just just uh just just flowers strewn in front of us and we just walked down a nice carpeted way to glory but that's not the way that god wants it to be you've got to have struggles and strife in your life to mold you into the character of the thing that god wants you to be you know just reading through hebrews chapter 12 verse 2 it says looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross he endured the cross so that he would have the joy of seeing you coming to being seeing you manifest one of his attributes being manifested in your life and he went through all that all that struggle and humiliation and nakedness on the cross and bleeding out for you so that you he could have joy with you he said in hebrews 12 despising the shame and has set down at the right hand of the throne of god and also in hebrews chapter 12 it says for whom the lord loveth he chasten us and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth if ye endure chastening god dealeth with you as sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not in other words every person every born again believer every child of god is going to be chastened you are going to have rough times you are going to have spots where you wonder if everybody's turning against you you are going to have dry periods where you wonder why your prayers aren't being answered because every son that comes to god has got to be chastened and he said but if you be without chastisement where of all of partakers then are you bastards and not sons how do you know that you're not a bastard because you know where you came from you know why you're going through the things that you're going through because god is molding something within you listen a bastard doesn't know where he come from or what he's doing here he begins to get confused he doesn't know his heritage but somebody that's come from god himself they know but by a revelation that god is speaking to them and dealing with him and molding them into something you know you see why the statue of a perfect man is so important when you begin to understand when the mystery of godliness begins to open up to you you realize how god is dealing with you that he's taken you through trials and troubles he's taking you so he can mold you into something the image of himself you know what chastisement is chastisement is just chasing by the affliction of evils and calamities to chastise with blows to scourge of a pot father punishing his son of a judge ordering one to be scourged and then the dictionary it talks about how the chastisement is to mold your character to mold you to to shape you to shape you and what god wants you to be and when chastisement comes brother brown he's talking about david down in this cave he's talking about david down in this cave enduring things and god the reason why he was enduring things is because god wanted him to not look at the surroundings but to look up and when you go through trials and troubles it's time to look up look up to the one that will quench that holy thirst brother adam said many times god gets us in tight corners where we have to look up sometimes we even have to get on our back in the hospital or a bed somewhere so we can look up to see where the great blessings of god comes from and that's what he said as the heart panettheth after the water books so panteth my soul after the o god like in psalm 119 it says it is good for me it is good for me that i have been afflicted that i might learn thy statutes it's good for you to be afflicted that you might learn what god wants you to know the law of thy mouth is better under me than thousands of gold and silver that's what you'll learn when you come through afflictions and come through trials that god is the only satisfier of the and soul berman said david said my soul thirsteth for god for the living god for the living god when shall i come and a fear before god what he was thirsting for was to see the living god to see god alive where would you see god alive alive and his people a lot that's what we're thirsting for we're wanting to see god alive in us we're wanting to see god take over our members and use our bodies and use our eyes and use our feet and use our hands use us for his purpose to completely take us over now brother adam said not some historical this is what this is what uh this is what david was longing for and thirsting for not some historical or something that happened some years ago or some tale that somebody told but for the living god a god that's ever present isn't that what we're interested in now we've all heard the stories of brother branham we've heard the things that have been told but i want to relate to you this afternoon that those that those are tales of a living god that is still present today he's still a god that's able to heal and save and deliver he's still a god that's able to come on the scene and help you to overcome whatever you're going through if you're down in that little cave like david was if you're down in the cave of life wondering if god ever cares for you i want to declare to you tonight like brother brandon said he cares do you care he does care he cares for you even if you think even if you're down in the cave thinking he doesn't my soul thirsts for the living god brother said see there is something in you something in you that wants to see the moving of god your soul thirsts for it don't stop anything short of that you do you realize that's why we come to church that's why we gather here that's why that's one thing brother said in the sermon thirst that we all have in common is we're all thirsty for something we come from different backgrounds and if you could go maybe through this whole congregation with different different kind of beliefs different kind of ideas about things different kind of ideas about politics and whatever it is but we have all we have one thing in common and that's worth thirsting for something and if you're thirsty for something if you're thirsting for something there's sh that shows there's something to respond to that thirst if you're thirsty for something that shows that there's where there's a deep calling there's a deep to respond if there's something within you hungering and thirsting there's something that's able to feel that thirst now see what thirsty is webster brother brown said brother bram looked it up in the dictionary and he said here's what webster says it's a painful desire a painful when you want something so bad it becomes painful to you i i wonder tonight how many have a desire for god like that so painful that you've got to do something to get to him you've got to do whatever you can to get to church whatever you can to spend along with god in prayer whatever you can to carve out time to listen to the sermons whatever you can because it's a painful desire that's what thirsty is and brother said thirst thirst is a natural thing thirst is something that's natural it's natural to every person here sitting here today it's not something that only a particular group of people get it's not something that's only reserved for like a special class of people but this thirst is something that applies to every single individual on the earth do you remember why christ speak brother roman said that moses had that special that gift that every man has every person on the earth has a desi the ability to make a choice whether they will follow after god or whether they will not whether they will come whether they will look for the quenching of that thirst or not brother said it's just simply something that god has given us to give us a desire for something he gave you that desire he gave you that thirst so that you will know i need something and maybe you don't know what it is you need yet but that's what the ministry is for brotherhood said god put that thirst in you it is natural it is there for a reason it is something you should do it's something you should do and he talked about you know he talked about how that wherever he went in the around the world down in the jungles down in the different parts of native american culture wherever it was that had not heard the gospel yet they were trying to worship in whatever way they could they were trying to worship with their little fires and their smokes and their idols and all the different things because it's something unique something native and natural in man to desire to worship there's something in you that is going to make you worship even if you've never heard the gospel you're going to try to worship your big toe are you going to try to worship a stone are you going to try to worship something that's sitting on a mountain you're going to try to worship an eagle something in you is calling out crying to get to god because you were made to worship listen you and i'm made to sit like a bump on a pickle or something said you were made to worship you were created to worship you're a creator a creature of worship brother brahma said he said he said you say i wish i wish i could live a victorious life i wish i could have that joy i wish i wish all these things when you look at a believer that's living a godly life and you look at them and say i wish i could live a life like that and he said well the reason you are feeling that way it's the thirst in you it's that thirst in you that makes you want to long for that it's just a natural thing it's for every person to thirst for god every person every person that thirsts for god not just a special group of people not just a special little little sect or whatever it's for every single individual the first after god and if you if it's for every individual that thirsts for god that promises to every individual to whosoever will let him come now brother brown said now there is two different kinds of thirst there is the thirst physically and there's a third spiritually there's a thirst physically and there's a third spiritually and the thirst shows you you need something to live it shows that you need that your body is lacking something it shows all these things that brother branham outlines in the message thirst it shows all these things and and the thirst the third the these two thirst physical and spiritual air war went up with one another and they first began to kind of be manifested in that story back in genesis and in eden because you know in eden there was a river that ran through there and the message super sign brother branham identifies the river he compared a symbol of the river of life flowing through eden and man got through their education and intellectual ideas they they they began they they founded that city of babylon that also had a river in it the river euphrates so there you've got the river of life and the river of death the bible says the river went out of eden to water the garden and from this it was parted and became into four heads a symbol a symbol of an eternal river an eternal river that they had access to there in the garden of eden and here comes the serpent to deviate to to get their mind off of quenching that holy thirst that god had given into them he the serpent comes into the picture to get their their mind off of that third quenching that thirst that way and to look at something else you see you see the those two thirsts have been warring ever since the thirst for the physical and the thirst for the spiritual the thirst for the satan's tactic is to offer his alternative to quench that holy thirst and he'll give you his alternative by perverting perverting everything he can he'll pervert church so it looks like something different than the way god wants church to be he'll pervert fellowship so that it's different from the way that the fellowship that god wants you to have he'll pervert everything away from the way that god wants you to approach him brother adam said god created man to thirst for life that thirst that's in you is a creation of god and right and wrong is set before you as a tree of life and death in the garden of eden and god made you to thirst and how dare you take that blessed thirst that god has put in you to thirst after him and try to quench it on the things of the world god has made you to thirst and we're thirsting we're thirsting after a river that will never run dry like in psalm chapter 46 it says there is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of god let's meditate let's sit on that scripture for for just a second the streams were of shall make glad the city of god so out of that river are coming streams out of this holy river of eternal life are coming streams and where do those streams go out of that out of that river they go into your church they go into your family they go into your home they go in the individual life and the streams of eternal life are coming out and you're when you tap into that you're tapping into eternity do you see and that's that's how god wants you to quench that holy thirst by by coming and feasting coming and drinking drinking from that fountain of everlasting life until you're full in revelation chapter 22 it says he showed me a pure to john he showed me a pure river of water of life clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of god and of the lamb and you see what we're on a journey for what we're what we're seeking for is a is to quench our holy thirst with that with that holy river with that river that where jesus said i i am that i am that fountain of life i'm the one that will quench your thirst now as the children of israel journey through the wilderness they got into some dry land they got into some dry times and and god had preparation for them along the way they began to murmur and complain and said we we want to go back we we've had enough we want to go back and so god moses i was reading the chapter where moses moses actually actually began to you talk about getting depressed he went and he told god i wish you'd just kill me how can i deal with these people i wish you just strike me down because how can i deal with these people that now you've delivered them and brought them out and they began to murmur and complain wondering if you were able to take us through and god spoke to moses as he said strike the rock and jo and moses smote the rock and out of that rock came living what came the water came the water that would quit how much water a hundred million liters of water a day is what people say in other words out of that fountain out of that fountain god has everything that you need you they might have wondered i wonder if god is able to take care of us just like maybe now you're wondering if god is able to take care of you but out of that fountain of everlasting life comes everything that you have need of you the baptismal holy ghost for your family the salvation of your home peace in your home i'm talking about peace where you don't have to war with your family all the time a peace where you can sit in the quiet solitude and meditate on the word of god joy joy where you're happy despite everything that's going on in the world that's what comes out of that fountain of everlasting life and you see they begin to murmur they begin to murmur and wonder if god had provision for them and they began to desire to go back you see god is restoring us back to what we lost but to desire to to give all that up and go back why would you ever want a desire to give that up why would you want to go back to egypt why would you want to go back to a fallen condition with all that you have seen when we have the pillar of fire and photographs when we have we have all the problems when the word has been opened up to us today like never before the entire bible has been opened up to us the nominations have pondered at the things that we read about but now it's laid plain before us why would you want to go back why would you want to go back to a fallen condition in eden why would you want to go back to bondage in egypt where you're bound by sin and bound up by by living in an immoral existence by your living in nakedness with bob's hair and shorts on why would you want to go back again to that why would you want to go back to nakedness and fig leaves where you all you have to cover yourself as a religion why would you want to go back to that forgive me for yelling why would you want to go back to the fair sacred pharisaical blindness well they didn't even know what they worshipped the samaritans didn't even know what they worshipped the pharisees why would you want to go back why would you want to go back to a denominational trip pest house well you don't even know what you believe why would you want to go back to a trinitarian idea why would you want to go back to short hair and beer drinking and filthy living and confusion and anything goes idea why would you want to go back when god has set us free that's what the message is for is to set you free to set you free and to give you freedom do you remember when brother brown preached the sermon on the jubilee year and he talked about how the slave when that message would go forth a slave could drop his whole and go free freedom and that's what the message is to give you freedom not to set you in bondage of a legalistic idea but to give you freedom to know who you believe and they know that god will give will do great exploits says the bible says this message has been sent to give us freedom if you'll get into the message and find out what the message really is about you'll be freer than you've ever been you'll be free to worship god in the way that you were meant to worship god you'll be free to serve god and the power and the resurrection you'll be free to serve god and live a godly christian life you'll be free from all that stuff that held you down free that that's what the jubilee year is that's what the jubilee trumpet is when that jubilee trump is sounded it went from ever from the from the highest mountain down from it to every minister ever down to the lower slaves sounding a message of freedom that you were free and you could go free that you didn't have to be bound by change of fear and sin anymore but you could be free that's what this message is this message is not just about a legalistic doctrine it is freedom ah y'all pardon me i i don't want me to scream what would you go back to and jude chapter one he says he says clouds they all without water clouds like what what kind of a cloud without water that's a useless cloud a cloud without water is just something for appearance sake something floating through the air something with nothing behind it no substance just a cloud floating around caring about a winds caring about every time something puffs you you go this way and then you go that way you're just carried about by winds you instead of being steadfast on the rock of salvation you're just carried about by you don't even know what trees whose fruit withereth without fruit a tree with the fruit withering on it and then he just says without fruit there's no fruit somebody that you walk up to and say tell me your doctrine what do you believe what do you stand for what do you believe in holiness that they don't stand for nothing trees without fruit twice dead plucked up by the roots raging waves of the sea foaming out their own shame wandering stars to whom has reserved the blackness of darkness forever why would you go back to that why would you go back to that in luke 9 62 jesus said unto him no man no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of god no man having started out on his journey having started out with an effort for the kingdom of calm of god and turning back no man turning back is fit for the kingdom of god if you put your hand to the plow put your hand ready to go into the field of harvest ready to go and serve god and you begin to look back you're not fit for the kingdom of god remember lost wife lost wife he was delivered it was set free and she turned back and looked back and turned into a pillar of salt to control towers now we find god gives the control tower to you to give to you the things that you need now the control tower in you is what directs you and this thirst runs in on this control tower and tells you what you have need of spiritually speaking the control tower in the body and in the soul also there was a control tower in the body that tells you the need that's needed in your body and it's brought to you by thirst also there was a control tower in your soul that tells you the spiritual things that you have need of something in your spirit and you by this can tell what kind of a life is controlling you do you realize that you can actually discern within your own being what kind of a life is controlling you how you're being controlled by what kind of a thirst that you have if you don't desire to come to church it throws everything into question what's controlling you if you don't desire to fellowship with god and defeased at the table of life then what is what is controlling you there's a third the thirst determine the thirst shows what is controlling you and you see there's a thirst physical the thirst physical will crave water in the desert the third spiritual will crave eternal life brother said there's a controlled tower in the body that tells you the need that's needed in your body and it's brought to you by thirst also there is a control tower in your soul that tells you the spiritual things that you have need of something in your spirit and you by this can tell what kind of a life is controlling you when you can see what your desires are brother adam said then you can tell by that what kind of something that's in you that's creating this desire that you have when you can see your desire when you can see what kind of desire you can tell what's on the inside he said there is a certain thing that you thirst for and it can tell you and your soul what this desire is by the nature of the thirst that you have in other words if you thirst for the word and you thirst for church and you thirst for fellowship and you thirst for being around unbelievers and you thirst for going to church even when you're on vacation and you thirst for songs and you thirst for praise and you thirst for worship you want to praise god and you want to serve him in the power of his truth you want to you want to you thirst for prayer you thirst for that alone time that that shows what's on the inside but if you thirst for moody movies and you thirst for parties and you thirst for drugs and you thirst for alcohol and you thirst for strife and you thirst for hatefulness and you thirst for enmity that shows what's driving you on the inside the battle between these two thirsts is raging on you see brother said the flesh starts to satisfy the desires that's in the body let me take that off this heavy weight that precepts me and this the flesh thirsts to satisfy the desires that's in the body and the spirit desires for the things that's in the soul desire is and many times these war against one against the other we find there was a great trouble today that too many people try to live between these two desires do you realize what the devil is trying to do let me just kind of put something in your mind here the devil is trying to divert you from the real thirst quencher he's trying to divert you let's see let's see how he does now romans chapter 7 verse 18 to 21 is a scripture we're all well acquainted with and in this scripture paul is talking about the war between these two thirsts and he said for i know that in me and he said that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i do now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwell offend me i find in a law that when i would do good evil is present with me so that we got a law that when you would do good evil good and evil are always present and brother adam explained this in the message hearing recognizing acting on the word of god that you'll as long as there is good you're always going to have evil alongside it you're going to have good and evil in the church you might have good and evil at work together good and evil even in your own members where i saw one one somebody on the internet kind of paralleled that your soul is the believer the spirit is the make-believer and then your flesh is the unbeliever well maybe that's a really good analogy because then your your members are warring against one another the unbeliever of your flesh is warring against the believer of your soul and they're always in conflict one another and whichever one wins is the one that you feed in them the most whichever one wins is the one that you quench the thirst of the most in other words if you're if you're feeding on movies instead of the word of god then that's the one that's going to begin to take over it's the one be the one that that begins to overpower the brotherhood said that where there is good there is evil where there is right there is wrong and we will never no matter what our environment may be ever be able to shake ourselves from the presence of evil evil the sinner will never be able to shake away from the christian the christian from the center now now let's just let's just dwell on that for a moment because this is something that's so powerful for the young believer to understand in other words for anybody to understand really when you begin to do something for god when you begin to step out in faith watch evil show up when you begin to try to do something for god when when you when you first get the baptism in the holy ghost watch somebody show up and say you ain't got nothing when you first when you first give your life to the lord watch somebody show up and tell you you ain't got nothing nothing happened when you're seeking healing in your body somebody will show up and tell you i i don't know you better go to the doctor and and line up all these reasons for you to take pills and medicines and all these kind of things and i'm not against pills and medicines and brother brown wouldn't but but listen you gotta you gotta keep your eye on the word above all else because when you begin to rely on medicine to function daily even when you begin to rely on coffee and things you're getting the law away from the right thing let me get back to my topic you see you'll never be able to get away from good when good is there evil is always going to be there so that's that's part of being a christian part of being in your cave is when you're going through like when you begin to praise and praise god and shout and maybe run around at a camp meeting or somebody somebody will be there watching in on the internet and saying look at those bunch of holy rollers brother branham actually said that in one of his sermons he said somebody will say you're a bunch of holy rollers somebody will say that and you've got to be able to take the criticism somebody will be there to say you didn't get nothing somebody will be there to say why don't you just go to the doctor and be done with it somebody will be there and say the church was going real smooth until you showed up somebody will be there to say that somebody will say what what are you even doing here somebody will be i don't even i don't even think you got anything real i don't even think i don't even think you know what you're talking about somebody will say you don't you can't do nothing right because it's it's ordained of god it's actually a promise in the bible that there are going to be offenses there's a promise in the bible that they're going to be offenses and what matters what matters is not the offense is when they come but what matters is how you deal with it how you deal with it you can bottle it up and bottle it up and bottle it up until there's an explosion and shrapnel goes loose shrapnel just explodes everywhere or you can do what brother aaron said and let off the pressure let it off by feeding on the word let it off by prayer let it off by coming to jesus let off the pressure by throwing everything on him cast all your cares on him who careth for you now brother brown said that when you're trying to do something that's worthwhile go to make an effort to do something that's good then you find out that there is the devil on every hand just to upset you everything that you and that's one good thing that i'd like to say this that the christians might know that when you are when you are starting to do something and there is something always trying to upset you and doing it do it anyhow that's the devil there trying to keep you from doing what's right now i'm not talking about doing a lot of tommy rod i'm talking about doing something that the word says you should be doing like getting the baptism in the holy ghost if the word says that promise is for you then you can have it it don't matter what all the naysayers and the critics say it don't matter how all the people that say you're just a bunch of holy rollers and all this kind of stuff it doesn't matter what they throw in your face you just look into the word and accept that promise brother and said you let a young convert come tonight do they alter somewhere here in this tabernacle across the nation and just remember just remember tomorrow mother will be more angry than she ever was dad will be all upset and all the school kids and everything just goes wrong because it's satan trying to get you to turn around it's satan trying to get you because why there's a law that where there is good there is going to be evil present as soon as you try to do something good evil is there when they find out they're trying to do something and everything is just blocking it off on both sides they say it might not bend the will of the lord and brother said see don't let the level devil lie to you like that do you see how important it is to be able to recognize when it's the devil talking to you a lot of people can't recognize when it's the devil talking to you now i want to i want to maybe share something that's really perplexing to a lot of people but the devil can speak to you through people at church or people in your family or people your friends the devil can speak and how does he speak he can actually speak now this might choke you a little bit but he can get in the reasoning and the memory of a born-again believer and go to twisting their mind around on the inside and they begin to dwell on it that maybe maybe brother aaron doesn't like me or maybe brother luis doesn't want to go out to eat with me or something or and and maybe i'll get to rolling that around in my head and meditating on it and before long i'm sharing all kinds of nonsense to other people i'm just spreading stuff and you see you see that's the devil that's how the devil works so listen when somebody it doesn't listen it doesn't even matter if i go outside this building and tell you something to contrary to the word of god don't you listen to it you only listen to the word of god keep your eyes steadfast on the word of god now brother bob show me an example of this in the bible now if you could if you would go to read in matthew chapter 16 verse 17 they're all sitting around and and they began to jesus begins to pose that question who who do you say that i the son of man am now listen to this how i'm laying out here let's listen just for a second bless and and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou he began to ask ask them who do you say that i am and peter had a revelation that jesus said came from the father that he gave him a revelation of who that was and he said blessed art thou simon bar jonah for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against the gates of hell will not prevail against the revelation now keep on reading down that down that chapter keep on reading a few more verses and before long you'll come to the place where peter's saying something that he needs to be rebuked for he began jesus began to share right after peter had made that made that statement of faith that statement of his revelation that i know who you are and jesus echoed back that the father has given you this revelation and then then then jesus began to share with them about how he was going to have to die and give his life and peter had a really good idea he had a really good idea in his mind and he shared it he said he said be it far from the lord this shall not be unto thee and jesus turned and said unto peter get thee behind these satan get thee behind me satan thou art an offense unto me why because anything that is contrary to the word that will take you away from the real first quencher is not from god it's eternally not from god anything anything that deviates from the word of god it doesn't matter who it's coming from it's it's not from god and you see you you see now what god is doing through the opening of the seals and the revelation of the statue of a perfect man and he's weeding weeding out all that stuff from you so that you're just speaking what god wants you to see so that you recognize when the devil is coming with some alive he is when he comes with something some fault so trying to take away your blessing or kind of heap something additional on top of the revelation of god he wants to bring you to a place where you know what you believe and you're not going to fall to nothing that the devil throws at you you see now while brother brown said there you can get to a place where the devil can circle you and and throw everything he can at you and he can't he can't get to a real adopted son of god a son of god that's sealed in sealed in with the revelation of who who he is and what god wants him to be amen you see when paul said when i would do good then evil is not and brother see the this is what this is what this is what david was thirsting for as the heart paneth after the water book so panteth my soul after thee he was panning panning for something to quench that thirst panning for something to make it real a living reality and brother adam said he said now that deer knows when when a deer is shot when a deer is wounded like a like a believer or somebody when they're wounded in sin and they know that they're going to die that thirst thirst kicks in to show that deer that he better get to water thirst kicks in with a believer when they're coming to church and they realize there's something lacking in them and they know that they've got to get to something or else they're going to die now brother brown said now that deer knows unless he finds water he's gone he just can't live i've tracked him many times after being wounded when he hits a stream of water he will cross in and get a drink go up over the hill come back down cross get a drink of water and go up and he's he says you'll never catch him as long as he's staying with that stream you the devil can never catch you as long as you stay with the river of life he can never get a hold of you as long as you stay with a satisfying portion he can never get a hold of you and brother said now the deer knows that so he'll stay right with the water where he can get to it right quick now could you imagine a deer with his nose up he has been called out somewhere where there is no water the deer knows because he's that that thirst has kicked in he knows that he needs something and so brother brown said that thirsting you as an alarm it's an alarm that you need something that thirst is an alarm that you're gonna die if you don't get something quick the thirst is an alarm that's going off and it's an alarm with a snooze button and you can keep reaching over and hitting that button and it'll go off and you can every time the alarm goes off in church maybe maybe the preacher is preaching a real inspired message and you realize you can feel that pulse setting down in your heart god is speaking to you god is light he's moving on you and something begins to take place and then you hit that snooze button hit that snooze button and back to sleep you go and after a while just like a real alarm clock you keep hitting that snooze button and after a while it stops going off and it won't go off anymore it gets weaker and weaker and weaker what is the alarm the alarm is is that depression is creeping in on you it's sneaking up on you it's taking over your life but there's something that can quit that thirst they get rid of that depression those sinful acts are killing you but if you'll let that thirst be quenched by the holy spirit of god he'll take care of you brother brown talked about the hounds of hell the hounds of hell are after you that's what that thirsty is the alarm the thirst the alarm thirst that you're about to die and it's time to wake up and do something it's time to wake up like the two leprous people and the bible talks about that when they're sitting there in the gate and they realize they came to their senses we'd better get up and do something and they got up and went and they realized that the battle had already been overcome because god had already fought their battle for them brother graham said in the message thirst he said unless i can find you lord i'll perish i can't go unless i find you and when a man or a woman boy or girl gets that kind of a thirst for god he's going to find something when you get that kind of a thirst for god you're going to find something but look what what does the devil want to do what does the devil want to do with that thirst he wants to desensitize you to the thirst he wants to desensitize you to the alarm maybe maybe all the theology sometimes all the theology begins to heap up and you begin to feel like you can't understand it and it begins to desensitize you to where you don't respond you don't respond anymore you just fail to respond that thirst begins to it gets begins to get you're putting the snooze button on and you begin to say maybe i have need of nothing that's echoing back that that that layout of seeing spirit i don't need nothing i have need of nothing and you begin to say maybe because you're not responding anymore you're not responding to the thirst that this is boring this is a whole lot of boring stuff that's being preached i have need of nothing and i sure don't need this and it becomes boring to you and and you begin to think that i'm i'm beginning not to realize that you're poor and rich and poor and rich and naked and and fine with that poor and rich and naked and okay with that okay with being in that condition you know you can even come to a place where you so desensitized to the word that maybe you don't even want the service to be successful maybe when the preacher begins to kind of stutter and sputter a little bit there's something in you you just want the whole service to fall flat but you know what a real mature believer when sick things begin to kind of stutter and whatever they want something from god and they'll begin to cry out and they'll begin to pull on the gift they'll begin to say amen preach that gospel you know i i was talking to a brother that would preach over in africa and stuff and he said you know those believers in africa they believe that when they're coming to church they are actually hearing from god they're not just coming to a lodge they're not just coming for the coffee they're not just coming for some donuts but they're actually coming to overcome something in their life they're coming to hear from god they hadn't put the snooze button on they're still they're not desensitized to the word but then when the word is preached something is actually taking place in their life and when the minister may become begins to stutter and everything they start pulling because they know that there's a fountain pushing behind that minister and if they can just pull and draw like an old pump something's going to come out listen that's when you really start going to church as when you when you know that you're going to get something when you want something when you know that there's a fountain there a fountain to draw from there's a gift that you can pull on there's something there that you're ready to receive you're holding your bowl out and you're ready to receive and take on something take on something that will change your life and change your family now now just as an exercise i began i began to run a search in the message of all the times all the places now y'all gonna laugh at what i searched for but i searched for wake up brother brother bro all the times that brother brown said it's time to wake up and i'm tying that in now not because actually everybody's awake praise god everybody's waiting everybody's doing it not because of that because see the devil wants you to go to sleep that's why there's 10 sleeping there's five sleeping versions because they go to sleep and they don't realize what's taking place they go to sleep and the devil wants you to go to sleep he wants you to hit that snooze button he doesn't want you to awaken to the truth and so when you when you if you run a search for all the things that brother brahma said he said wake up people to the facts that jesus is here not me i represent him right through here stands that angel can't you see that light he said you're afraid to take his word afraid to trust him if you just only know how good he is to you if you only wake up to realize god be merciful to you wake up where at the end time here it is the handwriting not on the wall but in the sky god said it would be and there she is it can happen at any time he said lord god grant this morning that people will wake up and see this last sign of the earth i pray god that you'll grant something to the people he said can't you wake up friends to a fact that it's a living god that's in our midst he said my my you need god people you need to wake up with the end of the road judgment is here he said the holy spirit moving showing signs and wonders of his coming and the church seems to set days not noticing oh if we could only realize if we could only come to ourself and wake up that it's the hand of god he said oh god help us to wake up the day of hesitation is here you say oh god doesn't send any angels anymore the holy spirit is that angel the holy spirit is that person the holy spirit jesus said he the holy ghost when he comes he will do the works that he did he'd be with us even in us and he would bring things to our remembrance that he taught and would show us things to come the works that i do shall he also now we're living in that day we're living in the time we're living in the time to wake up it's not time to come to a lodge anymore it's not time to come just for the coffee it's not time just to come to look at one another but it's time to wake up to that living reality well there's a living god in our midst today [Applause] you know you know that brother brahma he began to explain in the message thirst in 1965 he began he went straight from that to begin to talk about isaiah and how isaiah began to wake up wake up from his theology wake up from his education where he had been schooled and he had it all laid down but one day he got in the presence of an almighty god and he began to see god face to face the one that he had heard ministers preach about the one that he heard people talk about then he saw god face to face do you realize that's what god wants you to do is wake up to a living god walking in flesh walking in two feet walking and talking he's still the same yesterday today and forever brother said isaiah that great thirst that he had had he perhaps was schooled he probably had a good education he had a marvelous conception of what god ought to be he had heard the priest he had been in the temple he had been raised to be a believer but you see he had never come face to face with it before he had a desire to do right he wanted to be right but he just had the educational side he had the theological side but when he got there in the temple that day and he's seen those cherubims waving these wings back and forth and realized that these angels ministered to the face of god and then my angels didn't even know what sin was and to stand in the presence of god they had to cover their holy faces to stand in the presence of god then that prophet cried out woe is me for i am a man of unclean lips all of my theology and stuff that i've learned all of my marvelous conception that i had of god i am face to face with it now face to face with a thing that he had learned about when you come you know moses went through that same experience his mama told him about a god she told him about a purpose in his life but one day he came to the burning bush and he was face to face with it do you realize you've got to come face to face with it too you've got to come face to face with a living reality a living god not just something dead a pain in fire of painted words on a paint on a page laying there in a book laying there in a book full of theology but when it comes off the page into a living reality you've been resurrected from dead works to a living a living christian experience do you realize do you realize when isaiah god in the presence of a holy god that he didn't he wasn't so concerned with everybody else he was just concerned about himself he began to cry whoa was me we are a people and unclean people we need to be cleansed you realize that's what brother branham said so many times we we look at love as being corrective but brother adam said also he also said that when you get away from divine love you can't overlook your brother's faults when you get away from divine love you're unable to love or look your brothers false when you when you get into the presence of a holy god then you begin to see things differently everything opens up differently we're just we're just about an hour but i have a lot more to say brother graham said that satan satan's objective is to pervert his objective is to pervert things to pervert that holy thirst and he said now how satan tries to pervert the satisfying of the soul that thirsts for the soul y'all okay for a little bit more i'm gonna run through how he perverts some of these thirsts he tries to give you everything to satisfy and he's so deceitful in these days of perversion this is a perverted world it's a perverted array i don't think there's anybody here that can question that now that you look outside and you see hollywood stars that don't know whether they're a man or a woman or something in between anymore everything's perverted when you when you ride the subway into atlanta like i did a year ago it's been a year since i did but you see all kinds of perversion even even a christian doesn't have to wonder whether the whole world is perverted and brother i said it's become the most deceitful age that any human being ever lived in it's more deceitful than it ever was now you just you just can't imagine of how deceitful the nations got even with our own brethren like american people and he began to talk about how that the devil will pervert and deceive to see it he'll pervert all these thirsts to deceive he'll pervert the thirst for success because you know a young man or a young woman will think that they want they need to get a good job and all these kind of things to be successful in this life to be but to be successful to really be successful goes beyond just the things that you do in this life it goes beyond getting a good job and having a 401k plan and saving up and investing in stocks but it goes further into eternal life all that stuff one day you're going to leave behind i remember brother danny you remember that joke brother jerry clower you should tell about brother jerry clark brother yeah he's our brother jerry clower used to tell about how that he saw that man being he lowered down in his casket with his car and and every somebody standing by saying that's really living as he was lower down into his casket now you see the paradox there is after all that life where you've heaped up all these possessions after all that then you think you're living but you're really not you're only really living you're only really a success if you're living for god and you see the devil will try to pervert that that's great that's wonderful that elon musk has all the ma great fortune that he's got that's great that bill gates has all the money he's got but what about true success true success all that's going to go away when he dies when he goes into the grave but true success comes from following jesus christ [Applause] excuse me but i've talked about how the devil will pervert a thirst for beauty and i know that i'm i'm i know i'm this might be perceived as metal a little bit uh listen listen parents don't ever tell your kids that they're not beautiful because beauty does not come from from the appearance this beauty that i'm talking about is something else it's something deeper real beauty does not come from from what what you think a lot of times what we think it is the reason we get the devil perverts it away and you begin to think that you're only beautiful because of all the makeup and the max factor and stuff or the way that you do your hair but that's not real beauty that's not real you know if you find a real godly christian woman that when she speaks it's encouraging words and she's encouraging you and can it kind of encourage a young man to get the holy ghost or whatever and out of her mouth comes a wellspring of living water that's real beauty that's the kind of beauty that i'm talking about the devil wants to pervert that away so don't ever tell your kids that you don't think they're beautiful or maybe they'll be one day a man that will want somebody that's not beautiful maybe one day there will be a man that wants real beauty maybe there'll be a man that wants real character and i'll say it to all the young ladies if you want to attract a good man you want to attract a good man by wearing max factoring and wearing high-heeled shoes and wearing all the dolling yourself up to look like the world but if you want to attract a good man then adorn yourself with modesty with with meek apparel and with with shame-faceness and sobriety like brother and i said look to first timothy 2 9 to see what kind of beauty god wants do you know what do you know do you know what shamefaceness is shamefaceness is a sense of shame or honor something that the world does not possess the ability to blush the ability the ability to realize that when you need to pull your dress down maybe when you need to go to the store and get a little bit longer dresses because they're shame-facedness you realize that what you're putting on display is not something for the world to gaze at but only for your husband to gaze there that's shame phase just that's the kind of character that god wants to see on display the kind of beauty that god wants to see on this place he wants to see modesty and bastefulness and reverence and regard for others and respect somebody a young lady that's not always flying up or an old lady that's not always flying off the handle telling everybody where they can get off and what they can do right he wants somebody to live in modesty and humidity and meekness somebody with respect respect to others soundness of mind and self-control that's what first timothy 2 9 is talking about and the devil will try to pervert that away and make you think that god wants something else to he'll treat health they'll try to pervert that away and think think think that think that lust is pretty think that covering up your your natural beauty that god gave you is pretty brother said oh my some of these people today out on the streets you can't tell a man from the woman i've never seen anything like it like human beings it's beyond human eyes painted way up like that them funny-looking lizard eyes all them funny-looking clothes also out of form they don't even look like a human being hair cut like a man wearing women's wearing men's clothes and then he said and then men turn around wearing women's clothes and a haircut like a woman and you see god don't want you looking like the world he wants you to be separated he wants you to be pulled apart and put a part he wants you to be a holy people and he's not making you holy by your works trying to do something trying to work something up but he's making you holy by you feasting on the word of god and it's changing your desire changing your thirst and that's how you tell what's on the inside is by your thirst by what you're thirsting after young ladies i would encourage you to thirst after beauty young men thirst after holiness and godliness thirst after sobriety thirst after a sense of shame or honor and modesty and all those things listen that might burn a little bit that might scald a little bit but it'll be good for you it'll be like good medicine that brother brown talked about he didn't want to take that oil down and his mama gave him it kind of made him gag a little bit it kind of made him maybe it was a little bit bitter but it was good for him in the end now the true church that a woman should have brother i'm sitting in thirst would be adorn herself adorn themselves in modest apparel and to have a christ-like spirit now that's the way the woman should thirst to be now if you want to be pretty that's what makes you pretty see that's what makes you pretty is a christ-like spirit and adorned in modest apparel i would encourage you to never make that confession again that i don't believe i'm pretty never tell your kids that you don't think they're pretty in fact you as a parent as a guardian of the of your children you should be the one to lift them up when they're down you should be the one to pick them up you should never tell your kids that you don't think they're free you know you got all the school playground to do that you got all that all that stuff and many times even at church people will say hateful horrible things and you're going to have that but you as their parent when they get back to your home you're there to build them up and encourage them and lift them up and show them in the scripture what be it what real beauty is about and brother brown said they even got the churches today the church is hybrid hybrid church is not fulfilling the true purpose he said that's right they get in here they just go to church it's a lodge instead of a church now let's see what he said about being a lodge a church is a place where people come together and worship god in spirit and in truth and worship god worship that's what you're here for your purpose is to worship and that's what your thirst is to worship a living god and he said today it's a lodge we go there and have a little time to shake hands and fellowship and some black coffee in the back of the building they go home till next week and we've done our religious duty so you see it's not a lodge because of the pastor saying it's a lodge or the the organization or whatever it is saying it's a large but it's a lodge when you make it a lodge when you come and that's all you're getting out of it it's just shaking hands and some coffee that's what you make out of it it's a lodge it's a lodge when that's what you've done instead of coming to fulfill that thirst to quench that thirst that holy thirst that's in you you make it a lodge you know i've heard so many people through the message say that look at all these denominations that's just a lodge large large laws they're just lodges and they could be coming to church and treating that church the same way where it's just a lodge to them nothing more than a place to get some fresh coffee brother brown said and where is thy strength go on sam said he said don't let the devil rob that power of the holy ghost away from you that's the thing that we need that's the life of a church take that out take out the life take out the life and you've got a lodge take out the life and you've got a lodge take the spirit out of the church you've got a lodge we don't want a lodge these are brother rams words that's for men who wants the lodge the lodge is for people that want that kind of thing but we don't want that we don't want a lodge we want to be able to worship anyone in spirit and truth he said we want a church that's filled with the holy ghost and christ is the king of it he said i feel religious right now because god will have one a church born again filled washed in the blood filled with the spirit all condemnation gone you see how the devil could even pervert fellowship you could begin to think that you're just coming to church to get around one another and that's what fellowship is to fellowship with one another to fellowship with your family but god wants fellowship with you god wants you to fellowship with him and the quietness of the evening at the cool of the garden like adam and eve walking in the garden along with him brother i said it's natural for a young man and young woman to desire love it's natural to want to be around other young people it's natural to want to be around other other christians but when we come to church it's to quench our thirst for him we come to church for to quench our thirst for him and to fellowship with him that's why psalm 42 said my soul my soul thirsteth for god for the living god now you know that david said here brother and i said for the living god now in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us then there can be no satisfaction until this word which is god becomes alive in you then you see god himself fulfilling the promises that he made in the bible that's what we're thirsting for to see god's word made manifest in us not just to get around one another and say we're fellowshipping a trade gossip and trade stories about one another and trade trade enmity and variance and strife until like paul said we just we're just devouring one another but our goal is to have fellowship with god brethren said to know him as life the person christ himself and he said it's a revelation that god built his church upon this whole thing is built upon the revelation and then and unless this is revealed to you do you see what we're thirsting for we're not thirsting just for some education over some theology but we're thirsting for the resurrection of god's word in our lives i'm trying to find a place to stop here and it ain't working in john chapter 4 verse 7 this story the story there is a story about a little woman that had a horrible a horrible backstory of all the things that she had done in her life and she had a thirst and she recognized that that thirst quencher was there when he began to speak to her and jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of god and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou wouldest have asked of him and he would have given thee living water living water why because he's the one that is the fountain he's the one that was walking in the garden of eden with adam and eve he's the one that we've been searching he's the one that they were looking for as they came out of egypt the one that that that rock that smitten rock type typed he's the one and the woman saith unto him sir thou that's nothing to draw with and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that living water you know his answer is i am that living water i'm the one and you know you know what's so special about this gospel is when you come to that fountain and drink it transforms you and now that water comes and it puts itself inside of you until you now you become that fountain that others can drink from in john chapter 4 jesus answered and said whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst but the water that i shall give him the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life the woman saith unto me sir give me this water that i thirst not neither come hither to draw and brother brahma said you cannot satisfy that by joining church you've got to find the person god himself which is the word and interpretation of himself today the promises that he made today you know what we're thirsting for we're thirsting we're thirsting for all these patterns that were laid out for us in the old testament we're thirsting for elohim we're thirsting for el shaddai you know what elohim is elohim is god along with his attributes and many people have pondered what that means it's a plural word what does that mean a plural word does that mean there's three gods no that means there's one god a god in singleness but plurality and attributes in other words everything that you have need of everything that you're thirsting for can be found in him everything that you need is in that elohim the same thing without shadow everything that you need is in the great breasted one and when a child is born brother instead of a child is born it immediately turns to his mother's breast because it was under under her heart for nine months and when you're born when you're born whether it's a denomination wherever it is you just immediately start looking for this message because you're turning you're turning to else yeti eye you're looking for real shout out you're looking for the one from which you draw all your strength else shady eyes where you get all your nourishment from he is able to give if you can receive he is able to give well the all-sufficient one do you think nobody in your whole life have you ever met that could fulfill all of your needs your mama and daddy could fulfill some of your needs your spouse can fulfill some of your needs the people at work can fulfill some needs they give you your paycheck and those kind of things but he is the only one that can fulfill every need he's the all-sufficient one he can meet every need no matter what it is he can meet that need and that's why matthew 11 says come unto me come unto me all you that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest i'll give you everything that you have need of take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light you know another thing that you find when you find jesus brother brown talked about how that just like david david was just an outcast just a little weak a weak little individual that even his own daddy didn't think he'd make a good king when samuel came to anoi everybody overlooked him and brother adam said that was the same thing about him he said i always was a black sheep i wanted people to love me but then he said one day one day i found a friend one day i found somebody that i could talk to now maybe maybe you're in that predicament tonight maybe you feel like there ain't even nobody in this whole church that's a real friend the kind of friend that you need nobody a friend at school nobody a friend at your work that you're all alone and you feel like a big old black sheep you are a little black sheep you feel like you feel like an outcast you feel like an off scout or somebody that's something that's been tossed to the side of the road but you remember in perfect strength by perfect weakness brother brown said that's exactly the kind of individual that god is looking for he's not looking for for heroes and sports and popular figures necessarily although you can you can you can come if you're popular and all those kind of things but he's looking for somebody that feels like like they're a little bit different something's not right because you're thirsting for something you're thirsting for god and brother bryan said when i got saved and found that something in me that i thirsted for a friend somebody that would be a buddy to me somebody i could trust somebody you can set down to and talk your troubles over with he said i found that real true satisfaction when i found jesus christ that real true satisfier that takes away all quenches all that thirst and gives you something that just looks like there's just nothing to take his place and it looks like that because it's true there is nothing that can take his place there is nothing that can take his place and when you when you find that first quencher it just bubbles up from an end from the inside then you can when it's bubbling up see you don't have to wait for somebody else to amen in church it's bubbling up so you can amen you can praise god even if nobody else is praising god listen you've got peace when it's not peaceful you've got joy in the midst of sorrow it doesn't matter if everybody else is praising god and happy around you or not because the artesian well is bubbling up on the inside you don't need somebody to pump you up or lift you up because there's something on the inside doing the lifting you see what you're thirsting for is the reveal word i'm gonna close up here in just a second oh my i'm skipping over all kind of stuff let's go back to this psalm 42 and we'll close just here in a minute i know y'all getting tired to the chief musician as the heart panetth after the water book so panteth my soul after the o god my soul thirsteth for god for the living god when shall i come and appear before god said david david the fugitive david the anointed king that was striving to come into what god had promised him david the fugitive down in that cave looking over at bethlehem and he began to think he began to thirst that physical thirst the thirst for that whale in bethlehem brother baby said he he began to remember about how when he was a boy that he'd play around that well and he'd go over and get a nice cool drink out of and had all those minerals and things in it and just tasted so good down from the depths of the earth it just come up and it questioned his third thirst and he began to think oh if i could just have some of that water from that whale in bethlehem you see his physical thirst he was craving that with his physical thirst and these three mighty men rose up and they began to battle for 15 miles or 13 miles or however however long it was miles and miles and miles of fighting to get to that well just to get a little water to bring back to bring back to david and when they came back when they came back david poured it on the ground that's right brother ram said when they went down and got the water and brought it back his soul thirst was so greater not for bethlehem not for bethlehem anymore but from jerusalem his soul was so he sacrificed the water said i wouldn't even drink it he poured it out upon the ground see his soul was more thirsty for god than it was to satisfy the queen's the thirst of his body with a good cool water he poured it on the ground do you realize what that said that's like jesus pouring his blood out on the ground in other words ignoring all the physical hardship ignoring all the stuff that you got to go through to get victory ignoring that for the joy that would come by overcoming the world and see now you you can pour out that water but pouring out pouring out your desire for anything of this world pouring out the desire for anything of the physical and desiring the spiritual pouring out everything because your desire is not for the things that you can see but you're looking to the unseen do you realize you can do that this afternoon as the musicians come you can you can do that now you can pour you can say i've looked at the physical long enough i've looked at something that can quench my physical thirst long enough but now it's time to pour that out i want something that will satisfy my soul i want a living reality brother brown said it takes more than joining a thirst more than shaking hands with the preacher more than living a good straight life it takes something to satisfy inside of you that pours down from god into the soul the deep calling to the deep but the noise of thy water spouts o lord the deep calling to the deep i wonder this afternoon as they say maybe just play something softly if you just meditate on that and take take stock of your life take inventory of your life you know at walmart and all these department stores they take inventory to see what they got and now maybe it's time to take spiritual inventory of where we are and see if there's something lacking in our lives go through the shells of your life and see if there's something that needs to be restocked go through the shells of your life and see if there's something that's out of place maybe there's something that maybe there's something that you need tonight if there's something you need and come with an empty vessel because god's able to feel if you'll like like he told the prophet to go dig this valley full of ditches and god filled it when they came and came with dug they dug it out dug out deep all all the all the stuff that they wanted to get rid of and god came and filled if you'll just come like that he'll he'll fill you up let's just stand to our feet and just praise the praise the lord [Music] let's sing it to him now and worship him [Music] you just love the lord this afternoon just love it just worship the lord now he's here in
