[0:50] sudden he was trapped he didn't know how
[0:52] to get out he said
[0:55] help so what help
[0:58] me he found me because he had got to the
[1:02] place that he didn't know what to do and

[19:14] nature but the best one about it was
[19:16] we'd see him in his people amen and I

[20:26] greetings from the family as well well
[20:28] and this morning we just want to look
[20:30] here in the word uh in the book of St
[20:32] John the 16th chapter I know that
[20:35] everyone here knows this verse by heart
[20:37] in the 13th verse of St John 16 just one
[20:41] verse the Bible says how be it when he
[20:45] the spirit of Truth is come he will
[20:49] guide you into all truth now brother BR
[20:52] preaches a guide and he stops when he
[20:54] reads that and says all truth he says
[20:56] what is truth the word so he will guide
[21:00] you into all truth into all the word for
[21:04] he will not speak of himself but
[21:06] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[21:09] speak I love this and he will show you
[21:13] things to come brother BR said in other
[21:15] words he'll be the one that will reveal
[21:18] the thing that you see amen we ask Lord
[21:20] this morning to bless the reading of his
[21:22] word as we just bow our hearts together
[21:24] and humble our Spirits in his presence
[21:26] how we could just say Lord speak to me
[21:28] today amen Heavenly Father Lord As We
[21:31] Gather here on this Resurrection Sunday
[21:34] father we are well aware this morning
[21:36] that we are not here in this building by
[21:38] ourselves but oh God we recognize that
[21:41] your presence is here and Lord we stand
[21:45] here as a human being father with just
[21:47] human efforts Lord but father if we can
[21:50] get ourselves out of the way both
[21:52] speaker and hearer then Lord you can
[21:55] come into our midst and father as your
[21:57] Prophet told us you'll do things that we
[22:00] know nothing about oh God may you heal
[22:02] our sick this morning may you save the
[22:05] Lost father may you inspire Lord those
[22:08] that are down may you Lord encourage
[22:10] those that are discouraged oh God May
[22:12] strength and Revelation father May
[22:15] anointing fall upon the hearts of your
[22:17] children Lord and father I pray for
[22:19] those that have Lord come this morning
[22:21] with a question or a desire upon their
[22:23] heart Lord I pray you would help me to
[22:25] get myself out of the way that the
[22:27] people would not see me Lord but they
[22:29] would see you father and they would hear
[22:31] you oh God lord I pray that you would
[22:33] bless our brother Dale father bless this
[22:35] assembly Lord and father may you
[22:37] continue to bless them and give them
[22:39] Lord many souls for their labor oh God
[22:42] and Lord we'll be sure to give you all
[22:43] the praise all the honor and all the
[22:46] glory for in the wonderful name of our
[22:48] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and
[22:51] all the believer
[22:53] says amen and amen may God richly bless
[22:56] you this morning you may have your seats
[22:58] here I I want to uh just to speak to you
[23:01] here for a few moments today uh from
[23:04] that passage of scripture in St John uh
[23:06] the 16th chapter the 13th verse uh where
[23:09] Jesus says when he the spirit of Truth
[23:12] has come he will guide you into all
[23:14] truth and I happen to believe amen that
[23:17] the spirit of Truth has come and is here
[23:21] among the church and I was listening to
[23:23] a tape the other day of the bomb in
[23:24] Gilead and the prophet of God said
[23:26] something that really just struck me he
[23:28] said when New Birth comes in it cannot
[23:31] come until there's a death first he said
[23:33] people don't want to die he said they
[23:35] don't want the simple leadings of the
[23:37] Holy Spirit he said they want to take
[23:39] their own thinking of it but you cannot
[23:41] than your thoughts you've got to thank
[23:44] his thoughts see then let this mind that
[23:46] was in Christ be in you amen he thanks
[23:50] God's thoughts brings God's blessings he
[23:52] said God's power to you and it'll make a
[23:55] mess out of you as far as the world is
[23:57] is concerned but it'll bring new life
[24:00] it'll bring resurrecting life it'll
[24:02] bring new thoughts it'll bring a new
[24:04] person it'll bring a new Faith he says
[24:07] it will bring you from death unto life
[24:10] so Amen in other words when the new
[24:12] birth comes in it's not going to be you
[24:14] bringing new thoughts or you bringing
[24:16] new ideas or you bringing yourself from
[24:19] Li from Death unto life amen but it will
[24:22] do it so it is not an idea it is not a
[24:25] tradition it is not a Creed amen but it
[24:28] is a person and that person is none
[24:30] other than the Lord Jesus Christ now
[24:33] when you start looking at this I want to
[24:34] speak to you this morning on that
[24:35] thought of simple leadings of the Holy
[24:38] Spirit the simple leadings of the Holy
[24:40] Spirit the prophet of God actually would
[24:42] pray this he said may it spread out
[24:44] through all the great Wills of God's
[24:46] economy that every church will have a
[24:48] Revival and the power of Christ shall
[24:51] surge through every church and every
[24:53] member until there's a Revival all up
[24:56] and down these valleys may it come again
[24:58] like it did years ago Lord bring forth
[25:00] the former and the latter rain together
[25:02] and may your people that's called by
[25:06] your name may they be revived again he
[25:08] said bring us back uh to the old time
[25:10] Pentecostal meeting Lord he said where
[25:12] the Holy Spirit can have the right away
[25:15] he said may we lay aside all of our
[25:17] learnings and just be simple people led
[25:20] amen by the holy spirit so that was the
[25:23] desire amen of the Propet of God is that
[25:26] we would lay aside amen everything that
[25:28] was contrary to the word of God in order
[25:31] to be a simple people amen that would be
[25:34] led by the Holy Spirit now you know as
[25:37] well as I that the prophet of God tells
[25:38] us that man amen was made to rely
[25:42] completely upon God he said see that's
[25:44] the reason we're liken unto Lambs or
[25:46] sheep a sheep cannot lead himself amen
[25:49] he has to have a leader and the Holy
[25:52] Spirit is supposed to lead us right amen
[25:55] so man is made that way and God made all
[25:58] of his works so simple that the simple
[26:01] could understand it now think about this
[26:03] amen that God made all of his works so
[26:06] simple that the simple could understand
[26:09] it and God makes himself simple with the
[26:12] simple in order to be understood by the
[26:15] simple that's a mouthful right there
[26:18] amen that God made all of his works so
[26:20] simple that the simple can understand it
[26:23] and God makes himself simple with the
[26:26] simple in order to be stood by the
[26:28] simple now it's been said that fools
[26:31] will walk with hobil shoes amen Where
[26:33] Angels Fear to Tred that's really true
[26:36] he said we walk over the simple things
[26:38] right he said we walk over God we walk
[26:40] over an orchid looking for a daisy he
[26:43] said and if we'll just simplify
[26:44] ourselves and get down how many could
[26:47] say Lord I don't want to be a
[26:48] complicated person I want to be a
[26:50] believer amen I don't want to be an
[26:52] educated person I just want to be a
[26:54] believer I love the way the prophet says
[26:56] it one time he says I don't want to be a
[26:58] smart man I just want to know him and I
[27:01] believe that's the real desire of every
[27:03] Born Again believer is not to be
[27:05] educated or to be intellectual or to be
[27:08] some great something but to be somebody
[27:11] amen that can recognize Jesus Christ in
[27:13] the power of his resurrection and has
[27:16] become conformable unto his death
[27:18] through the fellowship of his suffering
[27:20] now amen I know that the Bible speaks of
[27:22] a falling away right it speaks of a
[27:25] turning back it speaks of a parting amen
[27:28] from revealed truth and I'll say it like
[27:30] this amen I believe that that will be a
[27:33] people amen who simply aren't able or
[27:35] they will lose their ability Amen to
[27:38] follow the simple leadership of the Holy
[27:41] Spirit now Jesus said it this way he
[27:43] said If any man will come after me then
[27:45] let him deny
[27:48] himself take up his cross daily and
[27:51] follow me said we must follow him amen
[27:55] is the only way to have eternal life
[27:58] amen so the leadership of God is this
[28:01] what it is follow the Vindicated word of
[28:05] the hour by the Holy Ghost amen the
[28:08] leadership of God is follow the
[28:10] Vindicated word of the hour by the Holy
[28:13] Ghost now we know this morning that the
[28:16] Son of God Amen was none other than the
[28:18] Lord Jesus Christ right and he was led
[28:21] by the spirit of God think of that the
[28:23] Son of God led by the spirit of God Amen
[28:26] the Bible says in Luke the 4th chapter
[28:28] that Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost
[28:31] returned from Jordan and was led by the
[28:34] spirit Into the Wilderness amen so Jesus
[28:37] was led by the spirit Into the
[28:39] Wilderness amen Romans 8:14 says as many
[28:42] as are led by the spirit of God Amen
[28:45] they are the sons of God see amen so
[28:48] Jesus the son of God was led by the
[28:50] spirit of God and according to Paul in
[28:52] Romans 8 that the sons of God will be
[28:55] led by the spirit of God listen Len amen
[28:58] Jesus was not under one leadership and
[29:00] the sons of God under another but it was
[29:03] the same leadership amen all the way
[29:05] from Genesis to Revelation amen from 47
[29:09] to 65 it was the same leadership and it
[29:12] was not the leadership of a man it was
[29:14] not the leadership of a bishop it was
[29:16] the leadership amen of the Holy Ghost
[29:19] that's why the prophet said amen the
[29:21] same holy ghost that led Simeon to
[29:23] believe amen is the same holy spirit
[29:26] amen that leads you to believe in Divine
[29:29] Healing he said there's no two Holy
[29:32] Spirits there's just one there's no two
[29:35] Holy Spirits there is just one do you
[29:38] realize the prophet of God would
[29:39] actually speak of a power amen that lays
[29:42] in the heart of the believer and he
[29:43] would say it's a power amen that you can
[29:46] actually speak a world into existence
[29:49] and go live a private life on it right
[29:51] amen he said see that's what power is in
[29:53] the church now amen but it is controlled
[29:56] by a law and the law is not a keeping of
[29:59] a bunch of Commandments amen it's a law
[30:02] of Faith Jesus said amen that all things
[30:05] are possible to them that
[30:08] believe how many believers do we have
[30:11] all things are possible to them that
[30:14] believe I love this brother Bob and if
[30:16] you can believe it then whatever God
[30:19] will lead your soul to believe that is
[30:22] yours if you can believe it then
[30:25] whatever God will leave your soul to
[30:28] believe that is yours every place the
[30:30] SCE of your foot can set upon by faith
[30:33] amen God gives it to you it's yours you
[30:36] possess it if you can find the key to
[30:38] this law of faith it opens it to you if
[30:41] you are a son of God you are a daughter
[30:43] of God that never leaves you amen it's
[30:47] with you all the time he said you get
[30:49] away from it but it's still there then
[30:52] when you're on the mountain the law of
[30:54] faith is still there when you're in the
[30:56] valley the law of of faith is still
[30:58] there when you're shouting the law of
[31:00] faith is there when you're discouraged
[31:02] the law of faith is there amen when
[31:04] you're well the law of faith is there
[31:06] when you're sick amen the law of faith
[31:08] is there listen church amen we are not
[31:11] about bu a carnal commandment seeking
[31:13] people we are the Bride of Jesus Christ

[31:18] faith in this hour listen I don't know
[31:20] about you but I think it's time amen
[31:22] that we start taking some possession I
[31:25] think it's time we stop sitting back
[31:27] letting the devil tell us what we can
[31:28] have and what we can't what we can
[31:30] believe and what we can't we are not
[31:32] under the governship and tutorship of
[31:34] hell we are under the Tor ship of the
[31:37] Holy Ghost and we have been led to
[31:39] believe in Divine Healing we have been
[31:41] led to believe in miracles we have been
[31:43] led to believe that the Holy Ghost still
[31:45] takes possession of hearts and lives in
[31:48] this generation listen we're not we're
[31:50] what we're believing my I feel like
[31:52] preaching what we're believing we're not
[31:54] believing it because somebody talked us
[31:55] into it we're not believe in it because
[31:58] it's a religion we're believing it
[32:00] because our soul has been led to believe
[32:02] it amen listen we believe this message
[32:05] because the same holy ghost that led
[32:07] Elijah to preach it is the same holy
[32:10] ghost that has filled vessels in this
[32:12] age to believe it whatever God will lead
[32:15] your soul to believe that is

[33:15] barely made it and there ain't much
[33:17] shouting he I tell you what that is
[33:19] that's people who are led by their
[33:20] spirit amen but if we're soul Christians
[33:23] amen we thank God that our soul has been
[33:25] led to believe amen that cloudy skies
[33:28] are no sign of God's disapproval amen
[33:31] and sunny skies are no sign of his
[33:33] approval amen but his approval is in his
[33:35] word and his word is in his bride and
[33:38] his love is bestowed upon you not
[33:41] because of the conditions of your life
[33:43] but because of the seed that was in your
[33:45] heart by the for ordination of almighty
[33:47] god listen we're not a bunch of Flesh
[33:49] Christians that serve God when
[33:51] everything's going good we serve him in
[33:53] the good times we serve him in the bad
[33:56] times amen that's why you're here this
[33:58] morning is because the deity on the
[34:00] inside of you is greater than the
[34:02] humanity against you come on Church the
[34:06] deity on the inside of you is greater
[34:09] than the humanity against you listen
[34:12] your flesh would told you this morning
[34:14] when that alarm went off you might as
[34:15] well sleep a little bit longer amen your
[34:18] spirit said well you've had a tired week
[34:20] and you've had a rough week amen you
[34:23] might as well just rest today but there
[34:25] was a soul in there there was a soul in
[34:28] there that said I got to get to the
[34:30] house of God I got to hear the word I
[34:32] got to fellowship with the Believers
[34:34] I've got to receive something from God
[34:36] what is that that is something in your
[34:38] soul that is leading you to believe I'll
[34:41] tell you what it is it is the leadership
[34:43] of the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost
[34:45] will lead you to keep going when
[34:47] everything else tells you to quit the
[34:49] Holy Ghost will lead you to believe
[34:51] everything's going to be okay when
[34:53] everything else testifies it's falling
[34:55] apart because because it's the
[34:57] leadership of the Holy Ghost now when
[34:59] you look at this word simple I love the
[35:02] definition of this it means easily
[35:04] understood or
[35:05] done pretty simple right amen presenting
[35:09] no difficulty it is used to emphasize
[35:12] amen the fundamental and straightforward
[35:14] nature of something it is plain it is
[35:17] basic or uncomplicated in form in nature
[35:20] or design it is without much decoration
[35:23] or ornamentation now how many will agree
[35:26] that we are living in a world where
[35:28] everything is
[35:30] complicated we're living in a world
[35:32] where everything is complicated do you
[35:34] realize education is
[35:36] complicated government is complicated
[35:39] politics are complicated amen amen
[35:42] political systems are complicated I'm on
[35:44] the economy is complicated amen it used
[35:47] to be on on November or whatever that
[35:50] Tuesday in November you went to the
[35:51] polls you elected amen that evening you
[35:54] knew who won now it takes two months to
[35:56] find out who
[35:57] who cheated right amen it's a it's a
[36:00] time of complication it's a complicated
[36:03] time right amen and I'll say it to you
[36:05] like this what has not already been
[36:07] complicated just give it some time and
[36:10] it will be if they hadn't complicated it
[36:13] just give it a few more days and they
[36:14] will like used to be you had a
[36:17] refrigerator right you got water out of
[36:19] it you got ice out of it it had two
[36:21] doors but now you got to almost have a
[36:23] college degree to even get a glass of
[36:25] water out of it it because everything is
[36:28] complicated do you realize that same
[36:30] Spirit has come over into religion and
[36:33] the prophet of God will show you that
[36:35] organized religion took a simple word
[36:38] and made it complicated he said in the
[36:40] church age book he said the Dark Ages
[36:43] the word was almost entirely lost to the
[36:45] people amen but God sent Luther with the
[36:48] word and the Lutheran spoke for God at
[36:51] that time but they organized and again
[36:53] the pure word was lost amen for
[36:55] organization tends amen towards dogmas
[36:59] and Creeds and not simple
[37:02] word the simple word was lost see they
[37:06] could no longer speak for God but then
[37:08] God sent Wesley and he was the voice
[37:10] with the word in his day then the people
[37:12] who took his Revelation from God become
[37:15] living Epistles read and known of all
[37:17] men for their for their generation and
[37:19] when the Methodist failed then God
[37:21] raised up others and so it has gone on
[37:24] through the years until in this last day
[37:27] there is again another people somebody
[37:29] say another people there is another
[37:32] people in the land who under their
[37:35] Messenger will be the final voice to the
[37:38] final age there is again another people
[37:41] in the land who under their Messenger
[37:44] will be the final voice to the final age
[37:47] then do you see what it was it was a
[37:49] simple people in the beginning but when
[37:52] organization come in amen they confuse
[37:55] the word and complicate the word and
[37:57] they moved away from the word and the
[37:59] people become denominational but God
[38:01] promised to raise up another people I
[38:04] say it you like this another people is a
[38:07] simple
[38:08] people another people is a simple people
[38:12] look what Acts 15:14 says it says Simeon
[38:15] hath declared how God at the first did
[38:18] visit the Gentiles Amen to take out of
[38:21] them a people for his name in other
[38:24] words God promised to call simple people
[38:27] God promised to identify the simple
[38:30] people I love what the prophet of God
[38:32] says he says I believe that you are
[38:34] risen from the dead how many believes
[38:36] that he's risen from the dead he said I
[38:38] believe he's risen from the dead 2,000
[38:41] years ago and you are alive tonight and
[38:44] you are calling a simple people just as
[38:46] you always did out here amen one here
[38:49] one there no groups no Organization no
[38:52] great manners of what man had done but
[38:54] you said you would take a people out of
[38:56] of the Gentile there would be two in the
[38:58] field you would take one leave one there
[39:00] would be two in a bed you would take one
[39:02] leave one he said the people here and
[39:05] there for your name's sake the bride so
[39:08] in other words the bride is going to be
[39:10] made up of a simple people is this okay
[39:14] he says Heavenly Father through our
[39:16] hearts we will see the spirit moving
[39:18] among the simple people just plain
[39:21] simple people I'm afraid father that
[39:23] many of us Tre teachers he said has
[39:25] tried to make it too complicated for the
[39:27] people in our great day of learning that
[39:30] we are in now everything everyone smart
[39:32] educated spend all their time studying
[39:34] books so forth getting Scholarships in
[39:36] school learning science and literature
[39:38] and Mathematics he said and left out the
[39:41] Holy Spirit they they've got all this
[39:43] education and they've left out the Holy
[39:46] Spirit that's why they have no new
[39:48] births that's why they have no new Faith
[39:51] that's why they've not passed from Death
[39:52] un life that's why there's no promise of
[39:55] a resurrection am because he did not say
[39:58] that them things would come by education
[40:00] he did not say them things would come by
[40:02] religion but he did say that through the
[40:04] new birth it would bring new life it
[40:06] would bring New Faith it would bring New
[40:08] Hope listen friends I think it's time
[40:10] that we welcome back the holy ghost in
[40:12] the church I think it's time we welcome
[40:15] him back in the Pulpit come on now I
[40:17] think it's time we welcome him back in
[40:19] our altars I think it's time we welcom
[40:21] him back in our young people amen we can
[40:23] have all the education we can have all
[40:25] the learning but if the Holy Ghost is
[40:28] not in the church there will be no
[40:30] transformation if the Holy Ghost is not
[40:32] in the church there will be no change
[40:34] but if the Holy Ghost comes He will draw
[40:37] out a simple people that will love him
[40:40] and who will believe him listen I tell
[40:42] you what a simple people is there are
[40:44] people that believes God can do
[40:47] anything regardless of the conditions
[40:50] they believe God can do anything amen I
[40:53] love what the Bible says how that they
[40:55] reason among them El and they said we've
[40:57] taken no bread in the Book of Matthew
[40:59] and he said like this oh ye little faith
[41:02] why reason ye among yourselves because
[41:05] you have brought no bread do you not
[41:07] understand neither remember the Five
[41:09] Loaves or the 5,000 how many baskets you
[41:12] took up neither the seven loaves or the
[41:14] 4,000 how many baskets you took up how
[41:18] is it that you do not what understand
[41:21] that I spake it not to you concerning
[41:23] bread but that you should be aware of
[41:26] the Le of the Pharisees and of the
[41:29] Sadducees he said then they understood
[41:31] they how that he B them not be aware of
[41:34] the leaven of bread but of the doctrine
[41:36] of the Pharisees and the Sadducees what
[41:39] did the Pharisees and Sadducees do they
[41:42] laid aside the simple leadings of the
[41:44] almighty God and instituted things in
[41:47] its place that brought confusion upon
[41:49] the hearts of the people the prophet of
[41:51] God was asked a question what did Jesus
[41:53] mean in Matthew 16 what do the 12 12
[41:56] baskets and the Seven baskets represent
[41:59] he said in other words like this if
[42:01] you've seen God provide and do a miracle
[42:04] then can he do a miracle
[42:07] again if you've seen him do one Miracle
[42:10] then can he do a miracle again in other
[42:13] words if he saves you from a life of sin
[42:15] can he not heal your body don't you
[42:17] remember when you was a sinner how he
[42:19] lifted up your soul and Faith to believe
[42:22] can he likewise do something great for
[42:24] you again see remember when they crossed
[42:26] the Red Sea God opened the way like and
[42:29] made the Red Sea open like that and walk
[42:31] through he come right on the side and as
[42:33] soon as he got without water they
[42:35] started murmuring as soon as they got
[42:37] without bread they started crying we
[42:39] don't have no bread he said didn't you
[42:41] consider the miracle back there at the
[42:44] Red Sea when they all got in a spot by
[42:46] the Red Sea oh they said we ought to
[42:48] have died here comes the Egyptians right
[42:50] on us now here it is what are we going
[42:52] to do said who smoked the Earth with
[42:54] plagues down there who kept the sun
[42:56] shining in Ghost and see we must
[42:58] remember these things remember that God
[43:01] is God we must remember these things
[43:05] remember that God is God listen to this
[43:08] and any of it he's still God and he
[43:11] certainly can do anything we must
[43:13] remember that God is God and he can do
[43:17] anything they say it to you like this a
[43:19] simple people simply
[43:22] believes a simple people simply believes
[43:25] there was a story one time told of a man
[43:27] he walked in a store and they said sir
[43:29] what are you he said well I'm a Believer
[43:31] they said well why are you a Believer he
[43:33] said because I believe they said well
[43:36] why do you believe he said because I'm a
[43:38] Believer they said well no you don't
[43:40] understand what makes you a Believer he
[43:42] said because I believe he said well what
[43:45] makes you believe he said because I'm a
[43:47] Believer see there's no way to get away
[43:50] from who you really are if you're a
[43:53] doubter of God's word you'll always
[43:55] doubt his word but if you are a believer
[43:57] of God's word then there's something
[43:59] higher than your flesh there's something
[44:02] higher than your spirit there's
[44:03] something called the holy spirit that is
[44:06] leading your soul to
[44:08] believe now what did Jesus say he said
[44:11] if thou can't believe all things are
[44:15] possible to him that believeth see I'll
[44:17] tell you what the prophet said he said
[44:19] Noah was a simple believer I love that
[44:22] Noah was a simple believer he was
[44:25] preaching a go goel that was out of line
[44:27] to the way of believing he said it was
[44:30] simply crazy that they could
[44:32] scientifically prove that there was no
[44:34] rain there but this simple sheep herder
[44:37] believed God said it would rain and it
[44:39] would rain he said just compare that
[44:41] with today when somebody gets healed
[44:43] well they say it's only emotion or I can
[44:45] scientifically prove to you that the
[44:47] cancer or the substance or the thing is
[44:49] still there but to the simple believer
[44:52] it's
[44:53] gone to the simple believer it's gone
[44:56] see because he's not looking at the
[44:59] substance he's looking at the promise
[45:02] said like this he said I lay my hands
[45:04] upon this sister may she have the
[45:06] attitude of the SAR Phoenician woman may
[45:08] she be healed in Jesus Christ's name he
[45:10] said let the heart be
[45:13] well let the heart be well in the name
[45:16] of Jesus Christ I speak those words it
[45:20] has to be well it can't be anything else
[45:23] Jesus said I can if you believe now if
[45:26] he can make a squirrel appear like that
[45:28] he did a Ram one time then he can make
[45:30] that heart appear normal and well has to
[45:34] be in the name of Jesus Christ let the
[45:37] heart be well he says Now isn't that
[45:40] simple it is simple God is so simple now
[45:43] listen you'd just be simple enough not
[45:46] to even think about it
[45:49] anymore if God pronounces healing upon a
[45:52] situation the prophet of God is inviting
[45:55] you to be simple enough to believe it's
[45:58] over amen it'll be all right I love how
[46:01] he talks about in the message make the
[46:02] valley full of ditches remember he talks
[46:04] about that that Indian man and they said
[46:06] he brought him his father to brother R's
[46:08] meetings to be prayed for and he packed
[46:11] him across the river on a stretcher
[46:12] imagine that amen this boy packs his
[46:15] father on a stretcher across the river
[46:18] to be prayed for in a meeting and
[46:20] brother said I said are you afraid
[46:21] you'll take pneumonia he said no Jesus
[46:24] Christ take care of me bring my father
[46:27] said oh that's it I said you believe I
[46:29] asked Jesus to heal your father heal him
[46:31] yep that's why I brought
[46:33] him I love that kind of confession I
[46:36] said pass him on by and as he went by I
[46:39] laid my hands over on the old man I said
[46:41] dear God an old ancient father here
[46:43] laying here old crippled up shaking with
[46:45] py I said have mercy upon him and heal
[46:48] him I pray in Jesus name I said now take
[46:51] him on as you believe so will it be amen
[46:55] amen as you believe so will it be I
[46:58] brought another one on the next one
[47:00] coming just so tired I can hardly stand
[47:02] there I heard somebody screaming going
[47:04] on looked and the old man on the board
[47:06] on his shoulders going on waving at
[47:08] everybody like that just that simple but
[47:11] you try to figur it out how it happens
[47:14] that's the reason you miss
[47:16] it that's the reason you miss it they
[47:19] just simply believe I love how the
[47:21] prophet shows us that when blind marus
[47:23] got healed he did not try to figure out
[47:26] who was passing by he believed on him
[47:29] who was passing by when Jesus stopped he
[47:32] did not move upon the beggar's voice he
[47:35] did not move upon the beggar's emotion
[47:37] he moved upon the beggar's Faith right
[47:41] it was by blind bardus is faith that
[47:44] actually stopped Jesus dead in his
[47:46] tracks I'll say to you like this a
[47:48] simple confession of faith can go a long
[47:51] way a simple confession of faith can do
[47:54] a lot of damage to the devil Devil's
[47:56] Kingdom now you see you see in the Bible
[47:58] how that Jesus spoke in a way that the
[48:01] common people could understand and could
[48:04] receive him gladly in The Book of Mark
[48:06] the 12th chapter it said David therefore
[48:08] himself calleth him Lord and whence he
[48:10] is then his son and the Common People
[48:14] heard him gladly said Jesus talked with
[48:17] such a simple language with a simple
[48:20] people and was written likewise he said
[48:23] they're trying but those great big
[48:24] swelling out stand then hold on to Dear
[48:27] hold on for dear life as I call it words
[48:29] they miss it it was wrote so simple
[48:32] correct so simple as it was to bring the
[48:35] gospel to the poor and needy he said The
[48:37] more simpler you can get the higher God
[48:40] will raise you the more simpler you can
[48:43] get the higher God will raise you you
[48:46] realize we got men that that go to
[48:48] schools for 10 and 15 years to become
[48:51] preachers and doctors of divinity and
[48:54] around this message God has taken
[48:56] country boys and and backward people and
[48:59] has raised them up to preach the message
[49:01] of the a you know why amen because they
[49:03] didn't have nothing to begin with they
[49:06] weren't worried about Prestige they
[49:08] weren't worried about social standing
[49:10] but they had a burden to preach the word
[49:12] and God honored the simple Faith come on
[49:15] church I tell you this if you want to
[49:17] rise amen lay aside the way you think
[49:19] things are and submit yourself to the
[49:22] way the prophet said things are and God
[49:24] will take you from nowhere and put you
[49:26] somewhere come on Church we're not
[49:28] following a God that needs the support
[49:31] of denomination he just needs a simple
[49:33] heart who will believe him regardless of
[49:36] the
[49:37] condition simple people never question
[49:40] the word of God are you hearing me
[49:42] simple people never question the word of
[49:45] God educated complicated people well
[49:47] they read what brother said and they
[49:49] swell you know we need to break this
[49:50] down and put this in and take that out
[49:52] somebody ask me one time they said
[49:53] brother Andrew where does your Liberty
[49:55] come from from where does your Liberty
[49:56] come from when you're preaching I said
[49:58] My Liberty comes from the ignorance of
[50:01] my Humanity to be able to say Amen to
[50:03] what a prophet taught whether I can
[50:06] explain it or not he said it I'm going
[50:07] to preach
[50:09] it come on church I think if we're going
[50:12] to believe this message we ought to quit
[50:14] dissecting it and trying to break it
[50:15] down under some educational approach and
[50:18] say it the way a prophet said it if a
[50:20] prophet said it take the gloves off and
[50:23] say what he said and back the devil off
[50:25] of the church and let the liberty of the
[50:28] Holy Ghost fall in the midst of his
[50:30] people and bless them and heal them and
[50:32] raise them listen I'll just tell you
[50:34] what I believe I believe this message is
[50:36] the truth I believe what a prophet
[50:39] taught is the
[50:41] truth I believe you do too so stand
[50:45] behind
[50:47] it you realize sometimes you got to
[50:49] stand with this message when you can't
[50:51] explain
[50:52] it absolutely sometimes you got to stand
[50:55] with this message when you can't explain
[50:57] it but if you'll stand with it the oh
[51:00] God if you'll stand with this message
[51:03] amen it'll pay off in the
[51:05] end
[51:07] right what are you saying I'm saying if
[51:10] you'll stand with it when you can't
[51:11] explain
[51:13] it right if you'll stand with it when it
[51:16] goes against your Pentecostal
[51:19] teaching well praise God anyhow it's the
[51:23] message so we stand with it regard less
[51:25] of our education we are a simple people
[51:28] who under their Messenger will be the
[51:31] final voice to the final age I love what
[51:34] Proverbs 14:15 says it says the simple
[51:37] believeth every
[51:39] word but The Prudent man lookth well to
[51:42] his go remember said those simple people
[51:45] they never question they don't question
[51:48] they see something done and that settles
[51:51] them every one of them he said you
[51:53] should never question the word of God
[51:56] that's what got the whole human race in
[51:58] trouble is when Eve questioned whether
[52:00] God would keep all of his word or not
[52:03] and I say tonight Brethren it's come
[52:05] time that we must believe every word
[52:08] that God
[52:10] wrote It's come time that we must
[52:13] believe every word that God wrote see
[52:17] every bit the truth you realize in order
[52:19] to believe now can I have some Liberty
[52:21] here in order to believe sometimes
[52:24] you've got to lay a some things in order
[52:27] to believe something sometimes you've
[52:30] got to lay aside some things you know I
[52:32] just I I I know brother Bob can handle
[52:33] it so I'm going to pick on him but if
[52:36] somebody if somebody told me they said
[52:38] you know they said brother Bob he's a
[52:40] he's a he's a crooked guy you better
[52:41] stay away from that guy don't fellowship
[52:43] with him don't talk to him he's a
[52:45] crooked old guy just stay away from him
[52:47] well you see they've told me that and so
[52:49] now I've come to believe that amen but
[52:52] if I really get to know brother Bob then
[52:54] I know that's not not what he is so in
[52:56] order to believe he's a good man a clean
[52:59] living man a loving man that believes
[53:01] his word and loves the Lord I've got to
[53:03] lay aside what somebody else told me
[53:06] about the man in order to believe the
[53:08] truth about it come on church and people
[53:10] have said stuff about this message for
[53:12] years they said well you can't quo this
[53:15] and well brother BR didn't mean that and
[53:17] that's why you got young people sitting
[53:18] in churches today that don't know if
[53:20] they've got the holy ghost or not
[53:22] they're in a faith crisis amen but I say
[53:24] this if if you can lay aside everything
[53:27] that's been taught contrary to what a
[53:29] prophet taught and let a message take
[53:31] preeminence in the church it'll Elevate
[53:33] the young people it'll Elevate the
[53:35] elders it'll raise your faith to a place
[53:38] to believe I am a Son of God I am a
[53:40] daughter of God I am redeemed I am saved
[53:44] I am Sanctified I am filled with the
[53:46] Holy Ghost are you hearing me you got to
[53:49] lay aside some things in order to
[53:51] believe something now the pr of God said
[53:53] go back to the beginning therefore if
[53:55] we're going to talk on the church age
[53:57] we've got to go back to the
[54:00] beginning if we're going to talk on the
[54:02] church age we got to go back to the
[54:04] beginning he said listen laying aside
[54:07] every
[54:09] statement laying aside every statement
[54:13] that man has said down through the
[54:19] age forgive me are you hearing me if
[54:23] you're going to lay aside something you
[54:25] got to lay aside all of it
[54:27] yes you say well brother Andrew can we
[54:30] hold on to a little 11 a little 11 leav
[54:32] of a whole
[54:34] lump that's right that's why the prophet
[54:36] of God said you can't mix Pentecostalism
[54:39] with this
[54:41] message this message will not mix it's
[54:44] an
[54:46] unadulterated pure genuine spoken word
[54:50] Original Seed message the prod of God
[54:52] shows you in the church age book amen
[54:54] that God God's people are simple people
[54:57] who are caring for truth rather than
[55:00] wealth they're caring for truth rather
[55:03] than wealth do you realize what a simple
[55:05] person is it's a humble person amen amen
[55:09] and a humble person according to the
[55:11] Bible is the one that inherits the
[55:13] promises in Genesis 18:17 the Lord said
[55:17] shall I hide from Abraham the thing
[55:19] which I do seeing that Abraham shall
[55:21] surely become a great and mighty nation
[55:24] and all the nations of the Earth shall
[55:27] be blessed in him Jesus said in Matthew
[55:29] 5:5 blessed are the meek for they shall
[55:32] inherit the Earth how many says Lord I
[55:35] want to be a Meek person blessed are the
[55:37] meek for they shall inherit the earth I
[55:40] I had a teacher in school bless her
[55:41] heart sister Turner she'd said like this
[55:43] she'd say Amen the Bible said be meek
[55:46] but it show didn't say nothing about
[55:47] being
[55:48] weak I said you know what I kind of like
[55:50] that because if you're not careful the
[55:53] devil will make you so meek and so
[55:55] humble he'll make a ragd doll out of you
[55:57] now you might as well face it it's got
[55:58] to a time now where if a man gets behind
[56:00] a pull pit and takes a sword to a spirit
[56:03] he's got the wrong Spirit he don't have
[56:04] the right Spirit he don't love a I tell
[56:07] you what that is that's a denominational
[56:09] spirit that come out of the pits of hell
[56:11] that doesn't want the spirit of Truth to
[56:14] lead the church he wants a personality
[56:16] to lead the church he wants a direction
[56:19] to lead the church but I have not been
[56:21] called Amen to uphold traditions and to
[56:24] uphold personalities but when he the
[56:26] spirit of Truth called me he said preach
[56:29] the word and anything against that word
[56:31] ought to have a sword taken come on
[56:33] church are you hearing me we're in a
[56:36] battle friends we're in a battle for
[56:40] truth we're supposed to be meek but
[56:43] we're not supposed to be weak we're not
[56:45] supposed to back up the spirit and I'll
[56:47] tell you what happened you back up to
[56:49] one spirit and you'll have 10 before you
[56:51] know it well we're we're heing it's
[56:54] Sunday morning and I feel good amen you
[56:56] let one devil in before long you'll let
[56:58] 200,000 in you let one evil spirit in
[57:01] before long it'll take over the whole
[57:03] entire
[57:04] church are you hearing me that's why
[57:07] America's in the condition she's in
[57:08] today it's CA a bunch of spineless
[57:11] cowards invaded officers without a
[57:13] backbone to stand against
[57:16] anything well you know it's the truth I
[57:19] guess it's the avanza coming out this
[57:21] morning you know what the truth 5050
[57:24] years ago gay marriage was not condoned
[57:26] from the White House you know why
[57:28] because there was some people there that
[57:29] had backbones that still believed a man
[57:32] ought to marry a a woman and a woman
[57:34] ought to marry a man they didn't believe
[57:35] a man and a man ought to marry and try
[57:37] to raise a child but today that's that
[57:41] that's that's uh uh uh it's
[57:43] congratulated and it's sponsored from
[57:45] the White House well it's the truth
[57:47] anyhow because it's an age of
[57:50] Toleration it's an age where nobody's
[57:52] wrong everybody's right nobody body's
[57:55] idea ought to be checked well I happen
[57:57] to believe anything contrary to this
[57:59] message being promoted from the message
[58:01] pull pit ought to be checked by the
[58:03] spirit of
[58:07] Truth well brother so and so I don't
[58:09] care who it is if it's against the truth
[58:12] and the simple leadings of the Holy
[58:14] Spirit the spirit of truth will check
[58:17] it it's an age of Tolerance it's an age
[58:20] where everything's okay amen and so you
[58:24] let down one standard and before long
[58:25] you let down another and another
[58:29] and come on now you know it's the truth
[58:32] it's it's all over America it's all over
[58:35] the government come on but there would
[58:38] be a bride in the end time who would not
[58:41] be letting down the standard she would
[58:43] actually be the
[58:45] standard are you hearing me what does
[58:48] the Bible say when the enemy comes in
[58:50] like a flood the spirit of the Lord will
[58:53] raise a standard against him and the
[58:56] spirit of the Lord is in the Bride come
[58:59] on and the standard of the Lord is his
[59:01] word and the word is the plum line it's
[59:04] the plummet of the church a man's idea
[59:06] is not the plum line of the church but
[59:09] the word is the plum line the word is
[59:12] the standard that I say it's come time
[59:14] that the word would have preeminence in
[59:17] every Ministry in every family and every
[59:20] marriage let the word of God have the
[59:23] preeminence for that word will make you
[59:26] a Meek believer and the meek shall
[59:29] inherit the Earth You Know The Prodigy

[59:38] Russia who's going to get this who's
[59:39] going to get that he said funny thing is

[1:00:09] inherit the Earth come on the Bible says
[1:00:13] that the wicked amen will become ashes
[1:00:16] and the righteous will walk out only
[1:00:18] ashes of the wicked were they going to
[1:00:20] walk out on the ashes of the Wicked on

[1:00:37] there but the word Earth is there
[1:00:39] because Psalms 24 says amen that the
[1:00:42] Earth is the Lord's and the fullness
[1:00:45] thereof then come on Church you're

[1:01:20] bunch of complicated doctrines and
[1:01:22] Creeds it's a person it's the simple
[1:01:25] leadings of the Holy Spirit by the
[1:01:28] spirit of
[1:01:30] truth I pray this is okay the Blessed
[1:01:33] ones are the meek ones and the meek ones
[1:01:37] shall inherit the
[1:01:39] earth I love this Jesus said blessed are
[1:01:42] the are the meek I love the way brother

[1:01:47] ones he said the ones that don't try to
[1:01:49] make some great big something shall
[1:01:52] inherit the earth Jesus said said so now
[1:01:55] they polluted it and God will destroy
[1:01:57] them but Fami will inherit the
[1:02:02] earth right after it's been
[1:02:06] purified so God will actually hide the
[1:02:09] secrets from the wise
[1:02:12] ones because they're the ones that have
[1:02:14] polluted the Earth destroyed the Earth
[1:02:18] but he will reveal it to the simple ones
[1:02:22] yes the meek in spirit and they will
[1:02:26] inherit the Earth are you hearing me
[1:02:30] like can I preach it's like people tell
[1:02:33] you you know I was just out in Canada
[1:02:35] the other day it's a funny thing right

[1:02:38] weekend and you go in a store now you
[1:02:40] can't get a plastic straw right you
[1:02:43] can't get a plastic straw you know why
[1:02:45] because all of a sudden now after
[1:02:47] hundreds of years of using it plastic is
[1:02:49] horrible for the environment so some
[1:02:52] wise person sit down and said said we
[1:02:54] don't need to use plastic no more we
[1:02:56] need to use paper so here's what we're
[1:02:58] going to do we're going to invent paper
[1:02:59] straws because they got an education I
[1:03:02] mean they know more than just some
[1:03:03] simple old farmer over here on the back
[1:03:05] side of Saskatchewan I mean they they've
[1:03:07] got all this education so now they got
[1:03:09] paper straws well let me tell you this
[1:03:11] go in a restaurant the other day and a
[1:03:13] kid's using a paper straw and the thing
[1:03:15] melts and the kid chokes on
[1:03:17] it so it's a complicated age where
[1:03:22] the where the eyes are saying the simple
[1:03:25] are destroying the Earth but in reality
[1:03:27] the simples are the ones that's going to
[1:03:29] inherit the earth I I pray I wish I was
[1:03:32] a preacher this morning are you hearing
[1:03:34] me the wise are destroying it amen
[1:03:37] saying the simple are the ones destroyed
[1:03:39] but the simple are the one who have come
[1:03:42] under the voice of redemption to the
[1:03:44] seventh angel and they are the ones that
[1:03:46] will inherit the earth the Propet God
[1:03:49] said God will not hide these secrets
[1:03:51] from the simple ones all this mystery is
[1:03:54] revealed only as he promised to his
[1:03:56] bride hell is against the truth of the
[1:03:59] revelation of this mystery amen but the
[1:04:01] bride is standing on it and who is the
[1:04:04] bride she is the simple ones she is the
[1:04:07] another people she is The Blood Bought
[1:04:10] redeemed Sons and Daughters of God and
[1:04:12] she will be standing on the Revelation
[1:04:15] that all hell is against that's her

[1:05:21] Foundation it's not a sliping stone it's
[1:05:24] a stepping stone it's a it's not a rock
[1:05:26] of offense to the bride it's the
[1:05:29] Cornerstone it's the place she stands
[1:05:32] when all hell is against her it's the
[1:05:34] place she stands when devils are trying
[1:05:36] to encroach up on her right she stands
[1:05:39] there as a bride who's under the
[1:05:41] revelation of the word and the age that
[1:05:43] she's living in listen Church the
[1:05:45] prophet of God likened you unto a little
[1:05:47] girl out in Oklahoma who the armor son
[1:05:51] came out there looking for a bride you
[1:05:53] remember that he said he went out there
[1:05:55] looking for a bride he said now watch he
[1:05:57] wrote out there I love this story
[1:05:59] brother Michael Le said they heard that
[1:06:01] there was a rich man coming to town
[1:06:03] looking for a wife right he said so they
[1:06:06] got out there and he said they got all
[1:06:08] ready can I preach to you in other words
[1:06:11] they complicated
[1:06:14] things they got all ready they went and
[1:06:17] bought the best dresses and the newest
[1:06:19] makeup and the newest Fashions and got
[1:06:21] the newest haird amen but there was one
[1:06:24] little old simple
[1:06:27] girl there was one little old simple
[1:06:29] girl over there who didn't have the
[1:06:31] fancy dress she didn't have the fancy
[1:06:34] makeup and the the the the man's son
[1:06:36] come riding into town and when he rode
[1:06:39] in there all them women went out there I
[1:06:41] believe they probably use it this way he
[1:06:42] said they went out there trying to Vamp
[1:06:44] him they were trying to get his
[1:06:45] attention he said and they was out there
[1:06:47] flaing around he said but that didn't
[1:06:50] get his attention because he wasn't
[1:06:52] looking for that he was looking for
[1:06:53] character
[1:06:55] he was looking for character right he
[1:06:57] said now watch he said when that when
[1:07:00] that armor son rode into town he said
[1:07:02] they were all out there carrying on he
[1:07:04] said but there was one little old girl
[1:07:06] and what was she doing she was carrying
[1:07:08] out
[1:07:10] dishwater Amen to the to the to the
[1:07:12] trash pile or to the trash whatever and
[1:07:15] was pouring dirty dishw water out I
[1:07:17] often preaching like this she was
[1:07:19] pouring out denominational
[1:07:22] dishwater she was out there pouring out
[1:07:24] denominational dishwater she had had
[1:07:26] enough of it she was sick of it she had
[1:07:29] been serving them cousins she had been
[1:07:31] serving that she'd been serving that
[1:07:33] tradition for years and when he saw that
[1:07:36] he said there's a woman that I want to
[1:07:38] marry and want to raise a family
[1:07:40] with right now listen to this the Bible
[1:07:44] said let us be glad and rejoice amen
[1:07:46] give honor to him for the marriage of
[1:07:48] the Lamb is come and his wife hath made
[1:07:52] herself ready
[1:07:54] said there she was getting herself all
[1:07:56] ready now notice this he told her he
[1:07:58] said now listen I'll return for
[1:08:01] you I want to marry you I'll return for
[1:08:05] you and he said when I return for you he
[1:08:08] said I'll take you home with me he said
[1:08:10] see you know what as he got closer the
[1:08:13] more critical her cousins got they said
[1:08:16] now listen I love the way he says this
[1:08:18] they said you poor little simpleminded
[1:08:22] thing right
[1:08:24] do you mean to tell you that that armor
[1:08:27] son would marry somebody he would marry
[1:08:29] somebody like us somebody who would fit
[1:08:32] in his Society somebody who had
[1:08:34] education who had some glamor about them
[1:08:37] see what's the what's the church thinks
[1:08:39] today but how far off they are how way
[1:08:42] off they are listen he was not looking
[1:08:45] for glamour that's right right he was
[1:08:47] not looking for society he was looking
[1:08:50] for character he was looking for virtue
[1:08:54] right amen are you hearing me he was
[1:08:56] looking for somebody who would be his
[1:08:59] wife he was looking for somebody brother
[1:09:02] Bob that would reflect what he was he
[1:09:05] was looking for somebody and brother B
[1:09:07] said she was simpleminded he said and
[1:09:09] when the little cousins got to making
[1:09:11] fun of her I love this Heen he said now
[1:09:14] watch he said he left and for two years
[1:09:16] he was away and for two years he she was
[1:09:20] criticized she was made fun of she was
[1:09:23] ridiculed she was ostracized amen but
[1:09:26] you know when the real criticism come
[1:09:28] you know when the real criticism come is
[1:09:30] when she put the wedding garment
[1:09:33] on God when she put the wedding garment
[1:09:37] on is when the real criticism come
[1:09:39] because now it is moved from just a
[1:09:42] confession into an action she has now
[1:09:45] amen joined her confession into a
[1:09:48] manifestation glory to God and she's put
[1:09:51] on the wedding garment and the little
[1:09:53] cousin her ha haa and they're laughing
[1:09:55] and making fun of her but she took her
[1:09:57] stand upon the word that he would return

[1:10:07] he's doing everything he can to destroy
[1:10:09] your faith but I tell you why he's doing
[1:10:11] that it's because you stepped into the

[1:18:28] yourself when you love God when you love
[1:18:31] one another oh yeah you mean these are
[1:18:34] ingredients to the third
[1:18:38] pool you mean this is actually connected
[1:18:41] to the third pool
[1:18:45] humility the right Spirit yes right
[1:18:49] that's right see as we grow closer to
[1:18:51] God we we do it by humbling oursel Jesus
[1:18:54] said whosoever shall exalt himself shall
[1:18:56] be a based and he that shall humble
[1:18:58] himself shall be exalted I love what
[1:19:00] Peter says he said humble yourselves
[1:19:03] therefore under the mighty hand of God
[1:19:05] that he may exalt you in due time humble
[1:19:08] that word means to bring into a humble
[1:19:10] condition to have a modest opinion of
[1:19:15] oneself brother now I've met some people
[1:19:18] and their opinion of themsel is far from
[1:19:21] Modest amen their clothes might be but
[1:19:24] their opinion sure
[1:19:26] ain't are you hearing me well you see
[1:19:29] the way the Lord revealed it to me and
[1:19:30] the way God showed me and come on now
[1:19:34] but the Bible says if you want to see
[1:19:36] more of the third pool humble yourself
[1:19:40] for he that will humble himself God will
[1:19:42] exalt can I ask you this you tell me
[1:19:44] another man on the face of the earth
[1:19:46] that could have seen the things that
[1:19:48] William Bram saw was a part of the
[1:19:50] miraculous Supernatural man
[1:19:52] manifestation that he was a part of come
[1:19:55] on now I'm talking about amen around the
[1:19:57] world seven times yes amen right around
[1:20:02] the world seven times in jungles in
[1:20:05] South Africa in a hotel room and they
[1:20:08] call him and say now come on Church come
[1:20:09] on preachers preach with me now amen
[1:20:12] amen amen in a hotel room and the the
[1:20:15] host Pastor calls and says open your
[1:20:17] window and look outside and he opens the
[1:20:20] window and there goes seven jump truck
[1:20:23] full of wheelchairs and stretchers and
[1:20:25] Cs and crutches and all kinds of
[1:20:30] things I know some preachers had walked
[1:20:32] out there and said well bless God look
[1:20:33] what the meeting man I tell you what woo
[1:20:36] glory for the next 10 years of meetings
[1:20:39] all you had ever heard is I preached in
[1:20:40] South Africa and there was
[1:20:43] seven come on it's I'm preaching you
[1:20:46] know it's the truth amen but a prophet
[1:20:49] said if you want to see more of that the
[1:20:51] more humble you get get you know why
[1:20:53] that it grew greater is because when he
[1:20:56] saw that it didn't exalt him it humbled
[1:20:58] him that's why he could go from there
[1:21:01] Down to Georgia Carter's house and she
[1:21:03] would get up off the bed that's why
[1:21:05] hadie R could be on the other side of
[1:21:07] the wall her boys and her hear about a
[1:21:09] prophet speaking squirrels into
[1:21:11] existence come on Church you know it's
[1:21:13] the truth amen I know men that's had one
[1:21:15] miracle and for 50 years they promoted
[1:21:18] one
[1:21:19] Miracle well it's the truth sir and
[1:21:22] that's all it's about is them but
[1:21:24] according to the Bible a simple people
[1:21:28] will be a humble people who will not
[1:21:31] exalt themselves or their knowledge will
[1:21:34] exalt Christ and one Miracle LED to a
[1:21:37] greater Miracle LED to and brother
[1:21:39] brother Michael at the end of William
[1:21:41] bram's Ministry he could come down to
[1:21:43] the end and say these words well it
[1:21:46] wasn't
[1:21:48] me I was just standing
[1:21:51] there when he come by see no I'm not the
[1:21:56] son of man I'm a son of man revealing
[1:21:59] the son of man but it's not my voice
[1:22:02] it's just what I lended my voice to are
[1:22:05] you hearing me he was in position under
[1:22:08] the word what are you saying preacher
[1:22:10] I'm saying this friends Jesus Christ has
[1:22:14] returned to human flesh in the bride to
[1:22:17] manifest the same nature the same
[1:22:20] characteristics the same Temperance the
[1:22:22] same patience come on church it's more
[1:22:25] than just a bunch of puffed up head
[1:22:26] knowledge of intellectualism reading
[1:22:28] charts and quotes it's a life lived
[1:22:31] every day it's a it's a salty life it's
[1:22:34] a life that is
[1:22:38] reflecting it's reflecting the very
[1:22:40] nature of God and that is drawing people
[1:22:43] closer to
[1:22:45] God the Bible said he being found in
[1:22:47] fashion as a man he humbled
[1:22:50] himself and became obedient even unto
[1:22:53] death even the death of the Cross are
[1:22:57] you ready for
[1:22:59] this he became lower than his
[1:23:03] creation direct
[1:23:06] quote he became lower than his
[1:23:11] creation who's just
[1:23:15] creation he became
[1:23:17] lower I pray this is okay then his
[1:23:21] creation
[1:23:23] that he he might redeem man listen who
[1:23:26] was homeless and
[1:23:28] helpless and give them a home in heaven
[1:23:34] he left the glories of Heaven he left
[1:23:36] the highest name that could ever be
[1:23:38] called and when he was on Earth man gave
[1:23:41] him the lowest name that they could give
[1:23:44] him said he was an illegitimate baby
[1:23:46] start with born in a manger wrapped in
[1:23:48] rags of the back of the Yol of an ox no
[1:23:50] place to go had no home to go in and was
[1:23:52] called be elub the chief of the Devils
[1:23:56] he was
[1:24:00] mistreated I know we may not be shouting
[1:24:02] but it's the truth anyhow he was spit
[1:24:05] on he was made fun
[1:24:08] of he was
[1:24:10] rejected he went to the lowest pits
[1:24:14] stooped to the viest of
[1:24:18] prostitutes that's what man done to him
[1:24:22] right that's right man brother Bob gave
[1:24:26] the highest God the lowest
[1:24:31] name but can I turn that and closing but
[1:24:35] God raised him up so
[1:24:37] high that he has to look down to even
[1:24:40] see Heaven oh God man gave him the
[1:24:44] lowest seat give him the worst place the
[1:24:48] lowest name but God raised him up and
[1:24:52] give him the highest seat and the
[1:24:54] highest name that's the difference what
[1:24:57] man done with the Son of God and what
[1:24:59] God done with the Son of God he stooped
[1:25:02] listen he I want to preach a message on
[1:25:04] this sometime he stooped that we might
[1:25:07] be lifted we were homeless church we
[1:25:10] were helpless and he stooped that we
[1:25:13] might be lifted he become us that we
[1:25:16] through his grace might become him he
[1:25:18] come to the homeless and became homeless
[1:25:21] himself that we might have a home he
[1:25:24] came to the sick and was made sick
[1:25:26] himself that we might be healed he came
[1:25:29] to the Sinner and was made sin himself

[1:27:40] it a guide and in John 16 he'll actually
[1:27:44] say it like this he said see he said
[1:27:46] what happened
[1:27:48] was he said you can't go nowhere even in
[1:27:51] Canada to hunt
[1:27:52] he said unless you take a guide with you
[1:27:55] right he said you got to have a guide he
[1:27:57] said now see what a guide is is a guide
[1:27:59] is responsible for you he said that God
[1:28:02] has got to see that you don't come up
[1:28:06] missing he's got to see that you don't
[1:28:09] come up
[1:28:11] lost he said that guide has got to see
[1:28:14] that you get back where you come from
[1:28:17] safely now you know something's actually
[1:28:19] funny to me I was talking to a God one

[1:28:31] said well he said the number one issue
[1:28:33] with guiding I said let me guess and I
[1:28:36] had all these things in my mind you know
[1:28:38] this is the number one issue he said the
[1:28:39] number one issue with guiding is is
[1:28:42] people that you're guiding shows up and
[1:28:43] thinks they guiding
[1:28:47] you I said really he said yeah he said
[1:28:51] the the number one issue we have is we
[1:28:53] got guides that we've trained and we've
[1:28:55] paid and they know and he said guys show
[1:28:58] up and they're trying to guide the
[1:29:00] guides he said we got a little say and
[1:29:02] here's what we say did you pay us or did
[1:29:04] we pay
[1:29:06] you he said when you remind them how
[1:29:08] much money they spent he said then they
[1:29:10] you know they kind of quiting down and
[1:29:11] start falling you but he got to tell me
[1:29:13] had a guide one time he said this guy
[1:29:15] got out there and he said like this he
[1:29:17] said I told him I said now here's the
[1:29:18] weapon to bring here's the gun to bring
[1:29:20] he said here's what to do he said okay
[1:29:23] yeah okay and he showed up with
[1:29:24] everything opposite of what the guy told
[1:29:26] him to
[1:29:27] bring so he gets out there in the woods
[1:29:29] and the GU well he said now I'll tell
[1:29:31] you this I mean a very a very smart guy
[1:29:33] he's telling us he said he said like he
[1:29:35] said I know I pray this is okay amen I'm
[1:29:38] going somewhere he said I know when
[1:29:40] you're out there he said especially up
[1:29:41] here in the snow he said you can look
[1:29:43] for tracks and he said when you see
[1:29:45] certain tracks he said you can actually
[1:29:48] identify just about the weight of the
[1:29:50] deer and all and this guy's
[1:29:52] knowledgeable and he said so what you do
[1:29:54] is you start following these tracks you
[1:29:56] know and he said well this guy I'm
[1:29:58] guiding him and he said I found some
[1:30:00] tracks and I said now here's what we're
[1:30:01] going to do and he said now you just
[1:30:03] follow me and he said he just kept on
[1:30:05] going and kept on going he said for long
[1:30:07] he turned around the guy wasn't back
[1:30:09] there and he said I'm looking around I'm
[1:30:11] thinking it's it's pure white out here
[1:30:13] he's got orange on and I can't see him
[1:30:15] nowhere he said where's he at he said
[1:30:17] that night he showed up at the cabin and
[1:30:19] when he got the cabin he said man where
[1:30:21] you being he said well I got to look at
[1:30:23] a around out there and he said man I saw
[1:30:25] some tracks here I saw some tracks there
[1:30:28] and I got to follow them tracks and I
[1:30:30] tell you what I got over here and he
[1:30:31] said but you know what he said I got
[1:30:33] over there and it was nothing but a
[1:30:34] bunch of
[1:30:36] squirrels he said you mean you followed
[1:30:39] them tracks all that far he said yeah he
[1:30:42] said I'm going home he said why are you
[1:30:44] going home he said this place ain't got
[1:30:46] no
[1:30:47] deer this place ain't got no deer
[1:30:49] whatsoever he said it ain't got nothing
[1:30:51] it's a waste of time about that time
[1:30:52] another guy brought a guy in off the
[1:30:54] same hun who was carrying a
[1:30:57] trophy and that guy looked at him and
[1:30:59] said see if you'll just stay behind your
[1:31:01] guide that's the
[1:31:03] result amen if you'll just stay behind
[1:31:06] the one that's been trained that's the
[1:31:08] result come on Church what are you
[1:31:11] saying I'm saying we never took a
[1:31:13] Rapture before we never took a
[1:31:15] resurrection before but there's a
[1:31:17] prophet Among Us who is laid in the
[1:31:20] presence of the son and his word he may
[1:31:23] be gone but the word is still here and
[1:31:25] it was not a man it was the word and the
[1:31:28] spirit of Truth is the word and the word
[1:31:31] is the spirit of truth and the word is
[1:31:33] the guide if you lay aside the way you
[1:31:36] think you can get home if you lay aside
[1:31:38] the way you think you can work it out
[1:31:40] and just humble yourself and no matter
[1:31:42] how contrary it is to the way that your
[1:31:44] grandpa grandma taught you about deer
[1:31:47] hunting right stay behind the guide
[1:31:51] right he's been
[1:31:52] trained and you'll become a trophy of
[1:31:56] his grace amen won you to stand to your
[1:31:58] feet with us this
[1:32:06] morning it's real
[1:32:08] simple it's real simple follow the God
[1:32:13] Amen the god he's responsible for you
[1:32:17] that's right he'll take care of you amen
[1:32:20] he'll see that you don't come up missing
[1:32:23] remember brother B said I got out there
[1:32:24] and he said I got on that death walk and
[1:32:26] he said I got to go in in
[1:32:29] circles he said here I was I'd been a
[1:32:32] God and he said I thought I could figure
[1:32:34] out on my own and you know this morning
[1:32:37] I know I'm going a little bit long but
[1:32:38] you give me
[1:32:39] Grace but you know this morning I find
[1:32:41] out what we got brother Michael we got a
[1:32:43] bunch of people sitting in churches
[1:32:44] doing the death
[1:32:46] walk they're going in circles amen going
[1:32:50] in circles around and around and around
[1:32:53] and around and around and around and
[1:32:55] brother said he said I hung that deer up
[1:32:58] and he said I thought oh God I got to
[1:33:00] get out here and he said I got to go and
[1:33:01] he said before I come back around he
[1:33:03] said well there was the deer and I was
[1:33:04] back here and he said you know what
[1:33:05] happens he said they wear themselves
[1:33:09] out that might be why people can't stay
[1:33:11] stay awake in church no more they're
[1:33:14] wore
[1:33:15] out they're trying to figure it out
[1:33:17] they're trying to break this down and
[1:33:19] put this together and make sense out of
[1:33:20] this and figure out why B said that way
[1:33:22] and why we can't call I mean it's just
[1:33:24] just wore
[1:33:25] out but I love the way he says this he
[1:33:29] said but the very minute I raised my
[1:33:32] hands I surrendered to the guide and he
[1:33:36] said when I did he said my hand touched
[1:33:39] the wire that's
[1:33:41] right amen he said my hand touched the
[1:33:44] wire he said and I got a hold of it
[1:33:47] brother Bobby said I got a hold of it
[1:33:49] and he said I wasn't turning it loose
[1:33:51] for
[1:33:52] nobody he said because I knew that that
[1:33:55] line would lead me back to everything
[1:33:58] that was dear to my heart on the earth
[1:34:02] he said no matter who told me to take my
[1:34:04] hands off of it he said I wasn't turning
[1:34:06] loose of it and I wonder this morning is
[1:34:08] there anybody here that says Lord I'm
[1:34:10] tired I'm wore out but today I want to
[1:34:14] surrender amen I want to get a hold of
[1:34:17] that line and I want to follow that line

[1:34:23] I want it to lead me back to
[1:34:26] everything that's dear to me maybe
[1:34:29] you've got a hold of that line maybe
