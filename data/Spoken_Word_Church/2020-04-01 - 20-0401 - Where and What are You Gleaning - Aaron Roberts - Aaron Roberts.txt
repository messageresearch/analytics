watching online and I know you're not with us physically but you know you're still with us so I'm okay everything everything's telling all right so well god bless you tonight we're gonna look into the scripture and wonder as brother Terrence was saying there's many that have needs and many sick this is from sister Barbara says her niece in Denver is quarantined at home and caring for her disabled father-in-law two daughters and a grandchild so y'all just remember old them out there I know that's that's the rough you know I don't know if anybody has said but I do want to say thanks for my mom and she's you know if you don't know my dad's at home now and you know that's all that's a big order for anybody and taking care of you know home health and everything is coming in but mainly most of it falls on mom and my sisters and I know mom appreciates the prayers but just continue to pray for the and dad has you know there's a transition thing going on but there's also a lot of some medical issues going on too and you know we just trust the Lord and just continue to believe that the Lord will do what he started and you know he shouldn't be here with us and you know I think sometimes you know we get we look at the wrong things but you know you think about my mom shouldn't be here with us either I mean you know they you know the doctors told my dad you know you need to make her funeral arrangements while she's still here with us so you know he's the same yesterday today and forever I know mom wants to thank everybody and and all of y'all for praying and y'all just continue to remember them and I think brother Ike LaFontaine I think they said that he had the virus and that's brother Paul brother and so we just don't remember him and and I don't know I know there's others that they had mentioned some overseas whatever really okay the comb donor path so let's remember the family there but many other ones and you know I want to pray for all the like my wife and all the ones that go to work everyday that you know the ones that are fighting this and you know it's a that's a big order that you know they have to go into that and I think about sister Ruth and sister Amy and all the different ones that you know you they go and all the doctors and the different ones that are having to you know fight that cell but you know God is a healer God's a comforter God's in control and so I just want to thank the Lord for that and thank for us being healthy and also remember remember Levi also leave us had a sinus infection and they put him on some medicine and he don't seem like he's getting any better but it's just all sinus stuff and you know nowadays this time of the year with the with the sinus infection you know people just start freaking out now because if you sneeze people start getting worried it's like well it's allergies I mean you know but that's just the time of season that we're living but you know we just know that the Lord said is angels would be about us protect us you know we just do what we ought to wash your hands and you know Paul said to leave Paul said to greet each other with a holy kiss and now which now it's been regulated to give everybody the holy wave so we're just gonna wave at you you know but try to try to follow the rules about all of that just staying away from you know everybody and you know remembering what you might carry it you know some people are not mindful of that you know you may not get sick but that doesn't mean that you don't spread it to somebody else that will not be able to fight it to be able to get sick so you know just like any other you know the flu or any other type of virus that that can be passed from one to the other so we just want to remember all of them but thank the Lord that we're here tonight and we're gonna look right into the scripture and you know just pray for me and we're gonna look you here in the Book of Ruth and look in the first chapter of Ruth here and I'm going to speak a little bit about gleaning and you know I was I heard somebody say something to you the other day and you know I just end up getting this little thought that I will want to speak on tonight about let's go where and what are you gleaning and you know what you glean where you're gleaning is what determines what you're gleaning and so you know you know determining what we're listening to what we're feeding on and and those type things and you know it you know it does it you know and in certain instances and without trying to get into too much but in certain instance we have people that they get into this situation where you know they either think that they can get it all themselves and they don't need any help or the it's they have this Catholic mentality we're just gonna look to a person that we're gonna get everything that we need from them and you know they're you know you have to strike a balance and all on that but you know I just wanted something I want to look at tonight and bring it from the scripture but let's just all bow our heads and we'll I'll speak to the father heavily father Lord we thank you for this evening Laurie this thank you for all your blessings on us Lord that were able to gather in this time Lord Lord there's so many that are sick and afflicted Lord Lord so many that are worried and scared but Lord we so thankful Lord in you didn't give us a spirit of fear but you gave us a power and of love and of a sound mind Lord we know that you're the Prince of Peace and Lord you've given us peace Lord that passes all understanding the Lord you give us assurance in this our Lord no matter what comes our way Lord Jesus we know that nothing can come unless you allow it Lord and we know that we believe in that was Angel's that are that are protecting us that are around us Lord that you said would guide us all the days of our life Lord that would be with us and Lord we just pray for each one Lord those that are sick and afflicted Lord the families Lord that are affected we just pray that you be with them and touch each one Lord for the ones that are watching in tonight Lord Jesus I pray that you be with them Lord Lord as they gather and listen Lord and just anoint their minds Lord anoint their ears to hear Lord Jesus Lord if they may receive something from you tonight Lord and just I know it me to say what I should say Lord or just give me the words that will be edifying Lord your father we just commit all things to you bless your bride around the world Lord and we know that whatever we have need of Lord Jesus you can come and meet and so I pray Lord Lord for those that need a physical touch Lord if it's a financial touch whatever it is Lord Jesus I know that you'll come on the scene and you'll meet it and we'll we just give you the praise the honor and gore for it the name of Jesus Christ amen amen Ruth chapter one they're gonna forget at verse 12 and save a little bit of reading here but most everybody kind of knows the story so you know this is Naomi and she says turn again my daughters go your way for I am too old to have a husband and if I should say I have hope if I should have a husband also tonight and should also bear sons would you tarry for them till they were grown would you stay for them from having husband's name my daughters for a grievous me much for your six that the hand of the Lord has gone out against me and they lifted up their voice and wept again and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law but Ruth cleave unto her and she said behold thy sister-in-law was going back under her people and unto her God's return thou after thy sister-in-law Andrew said entreat me not to leave thee nor to return from following after thee for whither thou goest I will go and whether thou lodgest I will Lodge the people shall be my people and thy God my God where thou diced I will die and there will I be buried the Lord do so to me and more also if I out but death part thee and me when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her then she left speaking unto her so they went they too went and they too went until they came to Bethlehem and it came to pass that when they were come to Bethlehem that all the city was moved about them and they said is this not as this Naomi and she said unto them call me not Naomi call me Mara for the almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me said I went out full and the Lord hath brought me home again empty and then call he meet Naomi singing the Lord hath testified against me and the almighty hath afflicted me so Naomi returned and Ruth with the mobis her daughter-in-law with her which returned out of the country of Moab and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest amen god bless you may be seated some docto most everybody is familiar with the scripture but you know well when there was a there was a famine that came in the land and Naomi's husband Elimelech and their two sons you know they wanted to go where the the famine wasn't where they had a thought they'd have a better life and you know they decided to go into Moab but you know there's no you can't go outside the place that you're supposed to be and you know you know the homeland is where they where the children of Israel were blessed and you couldn't go outside that and be blessed and and you know they went out there and you know there was there they were there I think around like 10 years and you know we know that Naomi lost her husband and she lost her two sons and you know all these things happen to her and then you know when all these things that happen and you know all this affliction that came upon her then she decided you know what I'm gonna go back to the homeland and you know lots of times those things happen to us so God wants us to be in a certain place well if we decide we want to go out well then you know these things happen to come our way that we get afflicted with things and you know hard times come our way and things go wrong in that but you know God is leading us back to where he wants us to be and you know there's a place for us to be and you know God sent them back and then she went in but you know she was so tore up about what had happened and you know she could just see her situation but you know and all of this you know there was something about Naomi there must have been something about her that Ruth saw something in her you know and you know when she saw her but you know she she had seen something and all that that she didn't want to leave Naomi she wanted to follow her you know there was something that drew her to the earth and she wanted she didn't want to leave her and you know brother Branham says in and the the message and inside and he's speaking of of Ruth he says and notice the inside was lifted up beautiful picture and Ruth and he said maybe you think you're eating meat Ruth as maybe a little love story in the Bible which it is oh what a beautiful story of representing Christ in His Church how Naomi went back over into the land of Moab there her husband died or husband or two sons died leaving widows on the way back the beautiful picture Ruth listen ruth the moabite a Gentile carried away with dumb idols like we were and when it came time Naomi kissed her and said go back to your people and with your people I'll go alone but she said let your people be my people let your life where let me live where you live let me die where you die let me be buried where you are buried and let your God be my god beautiful picture of the young Gentile church coming and by the old Jewish Church the Jews had packed the gospel first he said oh how marvelous so we know that the you know that is the type of truth the word being brought to the Gentiles but you know she went back and followed her but you know it was something that was drawing her back and we know the brother Bram talked about you know it was the Holy Ghost bringing Ruth to the place that she ought to be you know there was a there was a place that God had for her and God was bringing her to that place that you know and you know so as she was being she was coming into the place where she ought to be and your Naomi came back but you know Ruth had had a great love for Naomi and to see there was you know that she said where your your God I want that God to be my god I wherever you believe I can there was something that it was about her that she wanted to follow the same thing and so when she went and I came back into the homeland she said you know she was there and coming back and you know here is here's a type of the believer coming back because we know through history that as says the Jews carried the gospel to the end of the Gentiles and you know here they are receiving salvation and you know that's the first thing that you have to do because you know there's the four steps in or the four areas of Ruth's journey that we look at you know the first one is her making a decision you know and so you know she has to make that decision and you know we all have to make that decision you know there comes a time where all of us have to make a decision what we want to do and you know those a man years ago as a man that was her brother was speaking and he was talking about you know the the things in life sometimes aren't big decisions and he he was preaching about you know Gary Cooper and the movie High Noon and you know he you're building up to this great crescendo this great gunfight you know and it's just and it just keeps building and building and building and and he said sometimes you know it doesn't come that way sometimes there's just slight things that come along our way and we don't take time to we may think it's just a minor decision that has to be made but sometimes we don't pay attention that you know that's actually a major decision and sometimes we don't pay attention that you know we we can overstep God's bounds or we can overstep the holy ghost' speaking to us because we don't realize that it's such a major event and sometimes we look back and it's like well you know you know I was I didn't listen to God all right you know I didn't pay attention well that's the reason sometimes it pays for us to take every decision that we make and try not to make our own decisions but take it back to God and let him lead us and say you know all our decisions you know we try to make them in ourselves well sometimes we make the wrong decision and the problem is is God's trying to speak to us don't let us make you know to let him make the decision to tell us what we need to do you know he wants to lead and guide us he said you know if we seek the kingdom of God first he said that all these other things will be added to us so if we just seek God and let him lead us because we know if we're just like sheep then we have to have a leader we have to have a shepherd we have to be led so that's what we need we need somebody to lead us through these things and you know so I don't want to try to make any decisions on my own or think that I'm smart enough to lay myself because I know I'm not I know I can't make any decisions I can't I can't make this journey alone I have to have somebody to lead me and guide me and carry me through and that's what he said that he would do so you know what I just want to rest on him I just want to I just want to put my confidence in him and you know even in these dark times and and the way things are going and and the economy and you know the sickness and different things like that you I'm so glad that when I wake up in the morning I can confess what the Bible says you know if I look at my situation sometimes you know we can get little discouraged we can get down but you know what I go right back to the scripture and know that he's in control and you know I can put my confidence in him and I can go to him for what I have needeth because I want I just you know I just want to live the life that he has called me to live and you know what he's called us to live a life of overcoming he wants us to be happy and free and we don't have to be bound and and worried and confused about things why because we have the ability to walk in the light of the word in the in the fullness of the word and your we have we have can over raise our hands and be joyous and happy and and praise God because of what he has done for us and not worry about the world and how things are going and you know people are you know people are getting all constrast about things and you know you see people nowadays they're people are all into things like what is it the Preppers and and you know all these different things that people want to do everybody's trying to prepare for your pocalypse and the end of the world and you know everything going wrong and you know like years ago everybody wanted to be able to underground shelter and you know everybody's gonna learn how to live off the land and you know everybody's gonna buy up all the ammunition and all the guns and everybody wants to learn how to be Rambo and all this kind of stuff you know because everybody's got to have something that's got to fill this need because there's such stress and anxiety that build-up with people because they don't know where to stand but you know if you can come to the place that you can stand in the rest in God you know then you don't have to worry about tomorrow but you know the thing is is if we come to that place you know God didn't tell us that we couldn't store up a little food or you know or do these calm things I mean that's a smart thing to do have a little money set aside for all these different things but you know what to the place that you know you know what storing up rolls and rolls of hand sanitizer and a hundred rolls of toilet paper ain't gonna help people it won't do anything for you but you know some people they have to feel like they're in control of something so you know they they ever I well you know what they got to buy up all this stuff and you know they sit on all this stuff and they think well you know I've got all this and you know yeah that's you know that's um how this is going to make give me comfort but you know what it doesn't do you any good it won't change anything so Ruth here and they only coming into the land the place where she had to leave all these things behind her you know this is this is all a life that Ruth had ever known you know she was this was the land of her her birth her family everything that she had known was right there but you know what she had to get up and make that decision if she's gonna leave all of that behind and go to a place you've never been before to see people she didn't know anything about you know brother Brown said at one time he was talking about Ruth's going into a land and you know she was going to a land that you know she didn't fit in and you know she was kind of made fun of because of being a Moabite a you know because the motorbike was an outcast I mean that was a type of person that you know the Israelites didn't more really associate with and here she is coming back into this land you know she had to give up all of that but she wanted to come into a place that that she didn't want to leave Naomi she wanted to come to this place because something that had you know and I'm sure that she had been told about that you know about these things so she wanted to go to this land that that held something was more than what she had him and mo lab and you know here she is going into this land and that she's traveling and and they come in and we know it come they come in at the in the barley season which is uh and you know Pentecost and you know brother Brown said you know that is Pentecost when because that's when the Gentiles Church came in was it was at Pentecost and and here they come in and when she gets there you know Naomi Desai you know she tells her Ruth tells Naomi you know I want to go work in the field you know and and the scripture says you know that she just kind of like happened into the field where they were that she would gather and take care of because you know Naomi yeah I'm sure she was getting up in age and everything but you know she wanted to take care of her mother lawn she's you know I'm gonna gather food from us and you know because that was a type of the of the law there the you know that you could dig and when they made the harvest then you know the rest was open for everybody to come and take you know the poor and everything could take part of it and so you know here she is gathering out of the field and you know and you know she's just gathering and as she's gathering you know you know she's gathering in and as she comes through there you know the Bible says that you know that she would just kind of happen into Boaz is filled but brother Ram said you know the Holy Ghost was leading her the whole time that led her into the fieldwork she ought to be you know and she was digging and she was gathering up out of the field and you know as you see that she's out there gathering up for the harvest and picking up what was left and you know in the midst of all that time here come Boaz to her and began to speak to her and you know because he first asked you know who is this who is this damsel this maiden in the field and they said well that's the Moabite woman that came back was Naomi you know it was something that struck Boaz that when he saw her in the field that what she was doing you know then he began to expound when he began to expound the roof you know he said I under staying what kind of person you are because you've taken care of your mother-in-law you know even even when you you could have went back and you could have went away but you are still here in a foreign land and all these different things and facing this ridicule and different things and here you are taking care of your mother-in-law and you know then when when Boaz comes Torre says you know don't you worry about anything but he said I want you to stay in my field he said this is where I want you to stay and he said he said as the Reapers go along he said I want you to gather with the Reapers he said I want you to stay with the maidens that are in the field and said you make yourself at home here in this field you know you don't have to go anywhere he said he said when you get thirsty you go drink the water that the young men have drawn and he said you stay right here and he said you stay here and gather until the harvest is over with you just continue to stay right where you're at and he said you know he said I've command the men not to bother you you just to go wherever you want to and then Boaz tells the Reapers and he tells the young men he said you don't let her you know you don't worry about where she goes she can go among the sheaves and she can gather and he said and you drop handfuls of purpose on the ground and she can gather that and you just let her go wherever she wants to and he says if you get hungry he said used to go and eat and you know he said that even gives her a quart and all these type things and lets her do what she wants and everything in this in this whole place and then you know here's now here's Ruth and then she you know she falls on the ground and she says you know how did I how did I become so in such favor with you the being that I'm a stranger in this land you know and he said because of what you've done and he said what you've seen him because what we've seen of you he said I want you to be here and I want you to take care of these things he said I want you to be taken care of and you know it's just you know and so we know this we know how the story is laid out but you know I won't look at a few things because you know it takes it takes you and I we can't just rely on just one person or or you know waiting on the fivefold ministry or or you know we can't just stand there and say well you know I'm get it all myself I don't I don't need anybody I'm just gonna you know listen to tapes or whatever you know I just get it all myself and you know years ago I heard a man say that the reason he didn't go to church was because it he said what Christ is outside the church and he said he said I'm on the outside with him he said I'm on the outside too because you know God he said Christ is outside the church they put him out he said I don't go to church either and he and a brother you know he said well you know he said he was knocking he was on the outside but he was knocking trying to get back in he said I don't see you trying to knock trying to get back in but you know everybody's got their own their own ideas about how things ought to be you know they want to pick and choose their own own scriptures but you know you know the thing is is but God has given us a place to be and you know it is the word and you know that's a brother and said that was a type of the word was that field and drawing the life out of that field he said it was eternal life coming out of that field and that's what he said that's what the Reapers were laying before Ruth for her to gather as she didn't have to go some other place but she could be right where she was that him that the Holy Ghost had led her to this place and you know brothers sisters if in your journey you know the Holy Ghost is what leads you to wherever you go it takes the Holy Ghost to lead you you know because you know it's the grace of God that calls us to repent it said you know we don't call ourselves we don't go seeking God but it's God seeking us but God brings us to a place that God wants us to show where we need to be and God has placed us in a place so we can feed on the word you know and so wherever you worry you go it has to be in the word where do where's where does the believers gather where does the Eagles gather they gather with the word together in the word together where the carcass see us so that's where we have to be but God has placed us in a place that we can feed on the word but the thing is is one thing it takes place that you and I must dig in the word it takes it takes laboring in the word you know as you know they were laying handfuls of purpose there in the field for Ruth but you know what she had to go out there and she had to get out and had to pick it up she had to gather it it wasn't that it was just somebody give it to her but she had to be in the field digging for herself and gathering for herself you know and so when those things come to be he laid out a balance left this thing open and made an invitation for her to have a half free reign and all these things so you know the word has been open to your us and we've been given an invitation to get into the word and dig and you know the thing is is not just just reading about it or waiting for somebody else to bring it to us but you know what those Reapers so those angels that are there in in the scripture that are coming forth bringing the word and he said how about the angels that have come tonight in this building or wherever you are listening to the world the word that he's come to bring you the word do for you to bring you whatever you have need of those angels are there to minister to you so if you're standing here tonight or sitting at home wherever you may be and you have a need then you know what you just wait on those angels to bring you what you have negative sometimes I think you know we don't realize what condition that we're in what what takes place when we gather where two or three are gathered in my name and you know what it doesn't matter that that you may be a hundred miles away you know what if you gather in his name then it doesn't matter what the geographical location is so if you're at home and you're listening in tonight if you're gathered in his name that it doesn't matter there's only a handful here that doesn't matter that's whoever has gathered together with him there's work you know that's binding together that we gather together in the work then he can come and speak and you can receive what you have need of oh if we could just open our eyes sometimes well open our spiritual eyesight man I tell you what you know brother Bram said you know he never wanted to leave that dimension he said on when he got into that dimension he said how much you know you never want to leave and he said when you're down here and in the in just your normal life and everything he said that's one thing but he said when you get into that other realm he said oh he said it's so wonderful to be in heavenly places in Christ Jesus and you never want to leave it and to know that he's there with us and you know he wants us to be with him and you know you know if we can just you know we have it well our lives and things that go and you know we just have to do things but you know if we can ever get to that place where we can always be mindful of him and you know the the story always like is where General Jackson was talking about he was the man that wrote him a letter was asking he said you know that scripture in the Bible where it says pray without ceasing he said you know I find that so hard to live that you know he just had I just don't understand that and you know General Jackson wrote him back and he said oh brother he said listen he said it's so wonderful he said I don't he said everything that I do he said he said I don't even open my mouth to take a drink of water and he said unless I give thanks for it he said I don't open a letter he said unless I pray to God before I opened the letter to prepare me for the contents he said I don't drop a letter in the mailbox he said that I don't pray for the recipient of this letter he said I don't he said when I couldn't make tote at Virginia Military Institute he said before I go before the cadets he said I pray for them that that God will help them he said that I can be the kind of instructor to them but they can receive what they have need of and he said oh well he said he said it's so heed he said he said as much as he said this is you were going to take a drink of water he said you automatically open your mouth he said your mouth will automatically open you don't have to think about it it automatically he'll open he said that's how instant it is for him to pray he said that he said am I so and grainy and he said he said I can't he suggested opening his mouth that he almost unconscious stop he said I'm praying to God and thanking him for the water and so you know many times if we can get to that place where you know that we can thank God for everything that we see and everything that goes on and we can talk to the Lord and one because he's right there but sometimes we walk right past him or we don't even pay attention that he's there with us until we need him or you know sometimes it's way in maybe late in the day or or whatever you know sometimes we get tied up with things at work you know and so sometimes we miss God that he's right there with us you know and he's such a gentleman that he stands there waiting for us to make time for him and you know it's like you know Lord I wish I could talk to you is like well you know I've been waiting on you I've been right here all day waiting on you just for you to open up so you can speak to so I can speak back to you you know sometimes if we just sit still and say Lord what would you have me to know what would you like to say to me because you know prayers prayers not just talking prayers listening you know prayers communion and so it takes communion that's two-way travel that's two-way communication so you know you know many times people want to sit down and they want to pray well I'm gonna pray for 45 minutes well you need to spend another 45 minutes just waiting to see if the Lord's got something to say to you because sometimes people you know they just won't do all the talking and and you know they they they're concerned about how things going we oughta we ought to have a plan and know how things gonna go and Lord we all you know it all go this way or that way it's like you know Lord how should things go well what should we know and how we just look to you and say Lord give us the direction we need to go or what needs to take place because you know sometimes when we pray and you know as brother Dale said many times you know we want to pray for certain things in our lives well you know what God's gonna give them to us and we say well lord give me patience well you know what when things come our way you know we don't want patients we want them now but we have we have things that happened in our laughs and you know we want to overcome things in our lives that we want to change things well you know what the things that come our way that soak the Lord I don't want that well you know what that's what you pray for and that's what's going to bring you exactly what you won't you know anytime that anybody that's ever played sports and though brother Wade has and different ones you know played sports well you know what you know you know they always tell you know you have to give 110 percent you've got to give 110 percent no matter what you're doing if you want to get good at it you know there was an old saying that many times people always said hey said don't practice something until you get it right but practice something till you can't get it wrong but you know what you got to keep on practicing it and you know the thing is is you've got a coach there and that coach is gonna be there and that coach is gonna find out exactly what you don't have right or what you can or what you can improve on and you know that's that coach is gonna get there and say you know this is what you need to work on you don't do this right you need to fix this for him or whatever and you know what and they get out there and yeah that's the one thing that you got to do whether it's you know batting or whatever you know that one thing it is whatever you do wrong you know that's wrong you know even if you're talking about a boxer they know your weaknesses and the thing whatever it is that you don't do right get it whatever your stance or your form whatever it is you know that that's the one point that they're gonna work on you all the time is sometimes they put somebody in the ring with you and that's the one thing is because you know you drop your keep your set of keeping your hand up all the time you garden yourself when you they put somebody in the ring and that's all they do it's waiting on you to make that mistake soon as you drop your hand and they just keep doing well you know what after a while you finally figure out keep that hand up you know whatever it is and you know many times people go through things and you know you you work on exercising and and all that and you wore out after practice all day and next thing you know you know what let's run some sprints you know why cuz we won't give you no because you wore out your you're winded and everything's like that it's like no now it's time to we're really start burning energy you know really and then it's like you know when you get done it's like you have you know you're just dragging along but you know what that's what it takes it takes that extra that you have to keep giving and you know you keep practicing on the things that you don't have right and that's the thing that goes that God sees in our lives whatever has to be done then you know those are the things that God wants us to work on and that's the things that come our way that God wants us to fix and God wants to mold us into his image and when you know well you know why do these things keep happening to me why because God wants you to become a better person because he wants to mold you into his image and this is what's bringing you to that place it's like well they they wish they could you know bypass all that well you know that doesn't work that way that God has brought us to the place he wants us to be you know you know just like when you have trials and problems and everything like that you know you know when you overcome them then you know you don't go through them but you know as you if you fail that trial you know you've got to go back through it again you fail at you go back through it again and so you know many times it takes a while and you know so it takes us going back to that place and saying Lord what is it what is it gonna take for me to overcome and which lots of times it's it's to the point we get to place sometimes in our lives that we realize you know that's not me sometimes it's what it takes is us surrendering to him that he can come on the scene and then we can overcome but as long as many times we want to we want to you know we don't want to surrender what we need to surrender because we get to a point where it's like well you know what Lord we're gonna give you 80% of it when 20% is gonna be mine or 90% and 10% you know I'm gonna hold on to a little bit well you know what that's still not gonna be right because until you give a hundred percent to him then you know what you've not overcome it takes a hundred percent it takes a total dying out to yourself a total surrender to Him and you know it's why it takes over so many times of people get into so many things and they do overcome to get into positions why they've not got to a place where they've surrendered and so you know the thing is if as Ruth came into this field you know when she come into this field you know he told Boaz told Ruth he said don't you have your eyes on any other field he said but keep your eyes on the field right here he said keep your eyes on the Reapers and he said you follow the Reapers through the field because this is the Word of God and he said those are going to be people that are becoming through there and he said you follow them and they'll bring you to the place that you need they'll give you the play the things that you have need of will be in the word and you'll receive it and so you know many times people have you know they wanted they want to get they want to do their own thing you know they to have their eyes on other fields but let me tell you something if you're going to live on the Word of God if you're going to receive the Word of God then it takes a total dying out he takes you staying in the place that God has placed you and it takes you stay under the headship of the word that can bring you to the place where you ought to be because if if Ruth had her eyes on all the other fields that were out there that wasn't the place where she ought to be you know because if Ruth had come along the way and she had her eyes on all the other fields and all the other places and you know what she might have missed Boaz when he come to the field to meet her why because she had her eyes she was out of position and you know the thing is is if we want to meet God then we have to meet him on his place he called a place for us to meet and that was under the word under the blood is where we're supposed to meet under Christ there is the place where we come to so we can meet him and that's where he's going to meet us under the shed blood of the word is a place where he wants us to meet him and if we get in there that field that he said he would lead and guide us into all truth and so here we always would come into this field and we gather where the where the word is and we stay where them where the angels are and not not only you know not only is the Angels you know the speaking of the heavenly angels coming but you know we've had it we've had an angel entire day we've we've had a we've had a prophet in our day to come to bring us the word so you know we don't have to about where we ought to be one because he brought us the war because it was Christ speaking to us through a person so a man come and spoke to us and he was the word why because we can have confidence in in the world we don't have to worry about naysayers or any other buddy-buddy saying what brother Brandon was wrong here he was wrong there but you know what he was vindicated by the word and he spoke to each one of us and you know what it becomes a personal revelation to where you ought to be you know I don't worry about what everybody else says you know they're okay you know they do whatever they won't do but you know the thing is as for me in my house we're going to serve the Lord why because it becomes a personal revelation you've got to put your stake down you got to drive it down it's got to become real to you to know what you believe were you gonna stay in it's not what everybody else believes it's what you believe you've got to come to a place to see Jesus Christ for yourself he said if you don't see Jesus crave you don't see Christ in every verse go back and read it again if you don't see Christ in your life then there's a place where you can come to that you can find Christ in the word because he's gonna lead you and guide you that you can see him and see everybody talks about if we're in the field if we're in the place in the word then you know what God brings men along the way to help us you know that's what I struck me about Ruth you know Boaz tells Ruth he says listen he said you stay in the wind the field this is my field he said you gather wherever you want to gather from this is all mine and he said he said you go along where the Reapers are and he said as they're gathering he said there's drop they're dropping handfuls so they were giving her more than what she just had to gather up off the ground but there was something that was being left for her so there was something left for us but in our day there was something left for us one because God come and give us something in our day you know because there was something that was given in every day in every church age there was something given but it was something given to us in our day something given to you personally in your day when brother Graham talks about the bride you know he said he always comes when he talks about Ruth he talks about the Gentile bride everything like it and then he goes back and he talks about it being the personal believer you digging in the word for yourself you're gonna find what God has for you but you know he talks about the young men that are in the field and he said he said these young men they've drawn water here they are helping in the reaping process here they all in the field working and he says I have two commanded the young men not to harm you not to touch you not to harm you not to not to plague you not to harass you here they are and they've come into the field and here they are and they're a blessing to you and they're here to help you and they're over there to watch over you and you gather with the other women in the field and you're working and you help yourselves to whatever you want now you want what struck me is because many people that they want to come into the word they want to get into into the word and they will walk a Christian life and they want to see things but the problem is as they get in here and they're worried and they're stressed and they're filled with anxiety about different things and you know what they don't have faith they don't have a place to rest in the Word of God because if you know what if you have confidence in the word if you have confidence in God that God will lead you and God will lead you and you know what he can speak through a person to you and you know what because so many people are so concerned about you know trying to get into the word but you know what if you get in the Word of God and you trust God then God will lead you and guide you to the place where you ought to be and you know what God will show you where you need to be and one of the things that people are so concerned about is whether they you know we're whether we ought to have a fivefold ministry or you know what we're just going to follow the Prophet well you know what the Prophet spoke that there would be a fivefold ministry in the last days you know people always talk about a return ministry where is the return ministry people preach on a return ministry well let me tell you brothers and sisters I believe in a return ministry I believe it's a fivefold ministry in the last days that's bringing the word for the return of Jesus Christ who brings Jesus Christ back in flesh why because the fivefold ministry bringing the word is going to perfect the Saints that's exactly.the the prescription that was given in our day for us to receive the word for him to come to us that we can be called away well because it takes us it's got to be the Holy Ghost speaking through somebody but you know what God doesn't work through fear God doesn't work through the anxiety God don't work through all confusion or anything like that but you know what if you can trust God then he can speak through one man they can speak through another one because he's a sane man it's the same Holy Ghost that they were their birth these men into this age and not only but he said he said it was a group of men called in every age that was the voice of many waters they were speaking the word that came through with those men so if you and I have confidence in the Word of God that he's the same yesterday and today and forever then there was a group of men they was called as Peter and Paul was called and John and the different ones that he called all the ones through the the Old Testament you know through the church ages you know all the different well it just wasn't it just wasn't the church age messengers but they were other men of God never called through that God spoke through the God use to bring the word all the way through he just didn't call seven men to bring the word but you know what he called a group of men in each age that was calling of God to bring the word and to perfect the people for that age to bring them to the place where they ought to be well then you know what God's called us to do the exact same thing so we don't have to worry about being confused why because the Holy Ghost inside of the fivefold ministry that's speaking through him it's not just a man speaking but it's the Holy Ghost and it's the only ghost on the inside of the believers in side of the church delay a team that's going to hear the same thing and you know what it's not me trying to give my word or trying to give my idea but it's the Holy Ghost speaking and it's only ghosts on the inside of you speaking and listening and agreeing to it you know we don't have to be worried and you know it's so it's so it's so I say silly but you know it's so sad to see people in this condition where the where they're so wrapped up about things and you know and gods trying to get people to understand that if he calls you and he and he's led you this way and he's me and he's trying to bring you to a place of adoption if he's trying to bring you to a place in the new birth he's trying to birth to you into the body all the ways that he's brought you if he can do these things that obviously he can speak through a man well you know I got a confident I got all the confidence in the world and brother branham everything brother Branham says I say yes sir amen hallelujah except where he mentions a fivefold ministry well how are you supposed to have confidence in what God says if you if you can't put your confidence in all that God says if you can't trust everything that God said that how are you supposed to believe how you supposed to come to a place where you need to come to but God's called us into this word he wants us to dig into the word and have confidence that God has called us to this place and showed us what we need to say - you know what we can dig in the word and you know it doesn't take just just just me it doesn't take just brother Dale or what are whoever wait but it takes every person working together God has called each one of us and you know what it takes you you've got to read the Bible for yourself you've got to pray you've got to listen you've got to feed on your own wait for God to speak to you and sometimes you know what it takes it takes those type things that people are feeding on that God can bring the word to us because you know we're just like those young men in the field we're just their servants that's the thing you know we're not we're not to be the hierarchy over everybody and rule with an iron fist and and you know and try to beat everybody down and keep everybody under our thumb because God's called us to be led by the Holy Ghost the church the church isn't being led by the pastor the church had been led by the Holy Ghost if you know because if we say well you know what I don't understand why brother Dale does search things I don't understand well you know what you need to pray to God and find out you know lots of times people ask questions like then they said well I don't understand that brother the way you don't understand you know and the problem is is you know what they don't understand everything your brother Dale knows and sometimes you know what God don't God don't tell me everything God don't show me everything so you know what it's not my place why cause I ain't the pastor you know some people they get so wrapped up in things and you know you know and they get to a place where they they start to cause more problems and I'd say you know sometimes I me well thank the Lord deeds to certain people ain't the pastor because you know if he's ordained of God to lead us through then you know what then he's been called to a place and you know God has prepared him for that place he's called him to that place and you know and God's brought him to that place that he can bring us to the place where we ought to be but you know he writes like well I don't know you know we got all these people we're just gonna we're just gonna sit home and listen to the tapes we just got we're just gonna do it we're just gonna do our little thing and you know we're so wrapped up in all these and all these things and we're we're just so and just involved in all these things and and you know and then when you talk to somebody you know what they don't know they don't know split piece from coffee grounds I mean you see people's lives you know it's where where is the growth where where is that where is the manifestation you know the thing is is worried where you grow it where where you manifest where is that where is the showing of God in your life and people people they don't see that but you know if you stand in the light and in the word you know what then your all your life ought to start manifest something and you know if you know because sometimes it takes a you know people don't want to look in the mirror of the word and see where they've grown if they're matching up do they not see where how far they've come and did they see that they've grown any because you know the thing is is if you if you stop at one spot if you if you get hung up on one spot if you if you don't you'll never grow past that and we see people you know that you wonder about them or do they have anything to have any growth in their life as the Lord spoke to oh yeah the God wants us to stay in the field and dig in the word and God has prepared something for us and you know for us to continue to gather and as as we gather in the end the word and we feed on the word then you know what it brings us to the place where we ought to be because you know as we saw she kept gathering and gathering all day long to the evening time she was out there gathering continued to gather continue to gather but then there came a time you know went at evening when she left the field and she went out and then she went and Naomi told her said you know now it's the time that when to go to the threshing floor because that's where Boaz is and you know she late she went there at dark after everybody had had went to sleep and everything and then she went down there and laid before Boaz and the threshing floor you know she laid there until he until he woke up and realized she was there and you know then he spread his skirt over her you know and he was speeding you know he told her he says you know that he spoke and saw what she had done and that she continued because she was looking for something she had a desire that she wanted to to receive from him and you know what then he said you know but he said Naomi's inheritance has to be redeemed and he said you know she has to be redeemed also and you know what she continued all the way through following the word until she came to that place that Boaz came before the elders and he took off his shoe and he said you know now I'm coming to redeem you I'm coming to fulfill everything that has to be done you know what it takes laying in the word because that's what's going to bring you to the fullness that's what's gonna bring you to the fullness as you stay in the word you know you know it people you see people and you know if you start out and justification if you're at justification then where you need to be is in the word that's what that's what brings you to the word is when you come when you come to God when you when you get saved if you're just a justification you need to stay in the word until he brings you to sanctification because what brings you to sanctification is the word that's what's going to bring you to the next state what's going to bring you to the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the word the word is what sanctifies you it takes the word that's what's bringing you to the place to be filled by the Holy Ghost that's what it takes it takes the word and you have to stay in the word and many times you know it's getting under a ministry that can lead you and guide you and teach you the truth because the problem is is we've got people that you know just because you're a preacher or whatever you know that doesn't mean that you can lead anybody and and I'm sorry but there's some you know that you know I I just you know it's kind of hard for me to have confidence in them one because we know that there's something that you know they're not they're not in the word you know how you do somebody's got to come that way and know what they're talking about to lead you that way and it takes that kind of leadership that somebody's gonna lead you through and you've got to stay in the word and to come to that fullness to come to the place that God has for you we need to follow it with God that he can be with us and he can carry us all the way through we have to worry about the different things in our lives God's going to bring us through God has called us to a place and I thank God that we have a place here you know I you know people say you know what why do you what do you say those type things because you know what I believe it you know what if I didn't believe the word was here I wouldn't be here you know what if I didn't if I didn't agree with the word then you know what I'd be gone because you know I believe this is what God called me to you know have I finished no I'm not finished but you know what I believe I'm standing in the fight I'm standing I'm still running the race I want to still be fire I still want to be in the word I want to become faithful in the word digging in the word gathering what God has for us the purpose that he has laid out for us the word east laid out for us I want to be faithful in that and gathering what I need for this journey because that's what it takes because it takes bringing in laying in the field of where God has called us to and you know what you can have confidence in God where God calls you to you know you know I don't I don't mind listening to the tapes I enjoy listening it takes I believe in listening to tapes but you know what I believe in a fivefold ministry time because you know what I can believe I can stand in in the field and you know what because if if the Holy Ghost is leading you then you know what the Holy Ghost will tell you whether something is wrong or not you know there's been times in my life where I've heard things anything you know it just stopped me in my tracks it's like I didn't understand but I knew something wasn't right and you know what you hold on to that for years and you know then all of a sudden God will show you exactly what the truth is but you know what God catches your attention well sometimes people just go right along and just you know they just scoot right over it and scan right over and they don't even catch anything it's like well we're gonna you know what what is it that that God's not showing them these people things and it's like well you know I just got confidence in and in brother Dale's like what you know what that that's good I got I got confidence in and this brother over here and or whoever else well that's good but you know you got to have the Holy Ghost for yourself you got to check up on the word for yourself it's like well I don't understand what people say I don't understand what brother Dale says I you know it just don't make sense to me well you know what you need to just stay in the word for a while it'll start to make sense too and brothers you know whoever they are you know if something's not right you know what you you stay and you and I understand people you know there's brothers out there good brothers fine brothers whatever you know they may be wrong about something and you know what we've all been wrong about something you know what it takes some time you know all of a sudden what the Lord may show them something that you know they're not right they might so you know I'm not I'm out trying to throw anybody under the bus or nothing because you know what I still want to hold grace out for everybody but you know what God will lead you and guide you into all truth God will speak to you what you need to have and it will show you the truth you know what I could have confidence in the word I can have confidence in what brother Bram said I could have confidence in this because you know we found people that you know they out trying to tear up what brother Branham said well brother Branham wasn't the prophet he said this isn't that neither and the next thing you know now they say well this ain't right either well then you know then who is right if the Bible is it right if the word is it right if brother Branham was wrong everybody's wrong then you know what I guess we ought to be following you then then they want to make themselves God you know we have a place that God can speak to us and show us what's truth you know what it takes it takes getting before God and seeking God and that's one thing that's missing in people's off people don't set God get before God seek God's face find out what's truth or not amen god bless you not lets off standing but you know if we can have confidence in God God can speak to us he can show what's truth answer our questions you know we don't have to we don't have to be worried or concerned about things you know but that's that that's the age in which we live right now is x times of confusion perilous times will come it's the time that we live in that people will live in this hour and they've confused and they anxiety and they worry and you know people that's walked in the message for years and years and years and now they said well I don't know if this is truth or not after you walk in it for years and years and then then they could see where brother Branham wasn't right it's a terrible thing that people have walked around but you know what it's a time of manifesting and we know that it's a time that there has been a mixed multitude that's walked off but you know what now's the time that it's going to be made manifest of who is who but you know what I'm not worried about that you know why because I'm gonna can still stay in that field and I'm gonna gather while God has for me and you know whether anybody else comes or goes whatever else they do that's so that's up to them but I know where God called me to be God placed me in the place where I need to be and I believe that each person ought to have an own church but you know what I don't I don't rely on the fivefold ministry to give me everything it takes me reading and studying and praying I gotta have my own experience with God I got to have my own time with God because it works hand in hand but it takes us all doing that together and people people are worried about all these type things well you know what God didn't call me to be worried and concerned and half fear and all these tough things God called me to a place of confidence and God showed me the word and showed me what was truth and that's what I've put my confidence in amen god bless you tonight let's sing you know here by to see amen 1:39 I'm rejoicing night and day as I want the pilgrim way for the hand of God in all my life I
