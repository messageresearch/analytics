[0:02] very nice time to trim
[0:07] going on
[0:15] wisdom. That's why they told Don but
[0:20] Nah, but they lie.
[0:23] Somebody sometimes it's a trick, right?
[0:25] It's just a trick. It's a trick. You got
[0:28] him fooled. All right. Good to have
[0:29] everybody with us this morning. I hope
[0:30] everybody had a good week. Good morning.
[0:32] Good week so far. And uh good to have
[0:35] brother D. Now, I'm sorry, I can't
[0:37] remember your first name. Oh, Elicia.
[0:39] Alicia. Elicia. Alicia. Okay. All right.
[0:42] Good to have you with us today. And um
[0:45] welcome everyone. We are uh on a series
[0:48] on the seals and we're on number four.
[0:51] And we'll kind of background just for a
[0:53] moment before we get started. Last uh
[0:56] Sunday, we touched a little bit on it
[0:58] and then we we backed up. So, we went
[1:00] through the first seal and we see that
[1:02] the that the seals are given in the end
[1:07] time for a group of people, a special
[1:10] group of people that takes this word
[1:13] that's been hid since the foundation of
[1:15] the world and open we had a prophet come
[1:18] to open the door, the portal like
[1:20] brother Dale's preaching. He had he
[1:22] opened the door so that we could step in
[1:25] because look, I can't get William
[1:27] Brown's revelation. I got to have my
[1:28] own. Okay. William Brown's revelation
[1:31] took him to a position that he was in,
[1:33] but brother Brown's revelation can't
[1:35] take me to that same place because he
[1:37] had a special place to be. But you and I
[1:40] have a special place to be. And and
[1:42] honestly, he prophesied
[1:45] cuz see it's prophetic. He prophesied
[1:47] that there was and we'll talk about this
[1:50] to this afternoon. I want to I want to
[1:52] really show you something on on on what
[1:54] we're doing here and and what's
[1:57] happening now that sometimes we think
[2:00] maybe we're we keep pushing it down the
[2:03] road. We keep pushing it. You know
[2:05] what's brother Brandham always said? He
[2:06] said man looks back looks forward and
[2:08] doesn't look at what's going on right
[2:10] now. That's right. Right. So we'll look
[2:12] at that this afternoon but it'll kind of
[2:14] tie in with all this. But the seals were
[2:16] given the sealed
[2:19] there's not there's not a seven sealed
[2:22] book outside of the Bible. Okay. Right.
[2:26] There's not a seven seal book mystery
[2:28] book somewhere hidden in a closet
[2:30] somewhere that No. Brother Brandham said
[2:33] you know remember they told him they
[2:34] said brother Rand with your revelation
[2:35] you could write another chapter of the
[2:37] Bible. He said that sounds good. He said
[2:39] but that would make me Antichrist
[2:41] because you can't add to one word of the
[2:42] Bible and you can't take a word out.
[2:44] Right? So everything that we need has to
[2:47] be contained in scripture.
[2:49] Everything. Right? And then we must read
[2:52] between the lines. Mhm. To get the
[2:56] revelation. Okay? Because simple
[2:58] reading, remember brother R said in his
[3:00] church age book, he says simple reading
[3:02] of the scripture is good.
[3:05] But you need a supernatural revelation
[3:07] from God to show you what the scriptur
[3:11] is talking about. Because Jesus said,
[3:12] "Eat my flesh and drink my blood." Well,
[3:13] he never explained it. Well, if you
[3:15] don't explain that, then we need to be
[3:16] all, you know, all be cannibals.
[3:20] That's what he said, right? Said,
[3:22] "Unless you eat the flesh of the son of
[3:24] man and drink his blood, you'll have."
[3:26] He said, "Unless you do that." So, he
[3:28] was pretty specific. But then Paul comes
[3:29] along by the revelation of the Holy
[3:32] Ghost. He tells us that he was talking
[3:34] about the wine and the partaking of the
[3:36] communion. And then we do partake of the
[3:39] body. But remember the is a real fine
[3:42] line, but a lot of the Catholic
[3:44] doctrines, if you moved them over just a
[3:46] little bit, they'd be all right. They
[3:49] take more communion. Listen, they take
[3:51] more communion than than most
[3:53] Protestants do. Cuz they take it every
[3:55] Sunday or whatever the mass is. They
[3:57] take it every time. But what they're
[3:59] saying is though is that wafer that
[4:01] they're giving you is they're turning it
[4:02] into the body of God or the body of
[4:04] Jesus. And that fulfills that scripture,
[4:06] eat my flesh. But the whole problem was
[4:09] was is is was that they drink the wine.
[4:13] So they think they've got the Holy
[4:14] Spirit and then they give it to you. But
[4:16] no, Jesus said, unless you eat the flesh
[4:18] or and eat the and drink the blood. So
[4:21] we must be, in other words, partakers of
[4:23] the body of Christ. Right? Eating,
[4:25] brother Brown said, on the body word of
[4:27] the son of man. We're eating eating the
[4:29] word of God. Right? So that's what these
[4:32] seals are for. They're to they're not to
[4:35] show you a new Bible or a new way of
[4:38] living. No, the way of living has been
[4:40] in the Bible. Brother Brandham did not
[4:42] come to bring
[4:44] us a way of life.
[4:47] He came to restore us back to a way of
[4:50] life. Okay? He came to restore. Remember
[4:53] Elijah's ministry is to restore. The
[4:56] Elijah in the Old Testament restored the
[4:58] altar, right? And then God came down and
[5:01] consumed the water and all the other
[5:03] things that was on him. But Elijah had
[5:05] to restore it because the prophets of
[5:06] Baal are those denominational ideas that
[5:09] were different from the ministry of that
[5:11] hour had tore it down. And that's what
[5:14] happened in back in the we were talking
[5:16] about this you know great age of Luther
[5:18] and Wesley uh the intelligence of man
[5:21] which is a wonderful time but still
[5:23] right in here is where all
[5:24] denominational ideas came out of this
[5:27] fourth church age which is the Catholic
[5:29] age right came out of that Catholic age
[5:33] then Martin Luther protested the
[5:35] Catholic church
[5:37] Wesley became a Protestant that's what
[5:39] Protestant means protest they they
[5:41] divided theirel from the Catholic church
[5:44] over what doctrines. But what did they
[5:46] do is they took
[5:50] Martin Luther brought a message. He
[5:52] called the people out. But as brother
[5:53] Devil was reading in Jeremiah, they gave
[5:56] that seven-year release. But then some
[5:57] people got drugged back into that same
[5:59] old denominational idea. Well, see, that
[6:02] denominational idea was before the
[6:03] foundation of the world. Satan says,
[6:04] "I'm better than you, God. I've got a
[6:06] different idea." So, there's your
[6:07] denomin There's your two, you know, you
[6:09] two um spirits. All right? in the
[6:12] framework of the church which is the
[6:14] Holy Spirit and and an evil spirit which
[6:16] is not so far from the Holy Spirit.
[6:18] Okay. All right. So it's not a big
[6:21] separation. It's a fine line. So in
[6:24] here's where all denominations were set
[6:26] up was in this intelligence age which we
[6:28] were talking about here with the third
[6:30] seal cuz that's the uh the four
[6:33] anointings or the four combat beast was
[6:36] what? The lion, the ox, the man, and the
[6:38] eagle. Right. Right. Right. the lion,
[6:40] ox, man, and eagle.
[6:43] Excuse me. They were the protectors
[6:47] of the ark. Cuz the ark was here. And
[6:49] then you had the lion, ox, man, and the
[6:52] eagle.
[6:53] What was Dan? Which one was he?
[6:56] Eagle. Eagle.
[6:58] Anyway. So anyway, so you had Dan, you
[7:00] had the four leaders of the 12 tribes.
[7:02] You had one here, and they had um three,
[7:07] 6, 9, 12.
[7:10] This is literally in Israel. You had
[7:14] three tribes over here, three tribes
[7:16] here, three tribes here, and three
[7:17] tribes here. And all of their banners
[7:21] were the exact Lionox, man, and eagle
[7:23] banner. Mhm.
[7:26] Of of the um of the combat beast that
[7:29] was shown in Ezekiel
[7:31] where it says talking about one face
[7:32] this face of a man, face of a lion, face
[7:35] of an ox, face of an eagle. And then we
[7:37] had a prophet in the end time. What he
[7:40] tell us those combat beasts were the
[7:42] Holy Ghost. The combat beast is the Holy
[7:45] Ghost. It is the boldness of a lion.
[7:48] The burden bearer of an ox, the
[7:52] intelligence of a man because you do
[7:54] have to have intelligence. It's just got
[7:55] to be God's intelligence. This knowledge
[7:57] right here is not man's knowledge.
[7:58] That's right. That's right. Man's
[8:00] knowledge turned this into a
[8:01] denominational idea these ages. Yes. But
[8:04] the knowledge of God never formed a
[8:07] denomination. It can't. That's why when
[8:10] brother Brandon brought the the seals or
[8:12] the headstone, it was not man's ideas.
[8:15] It was not something that you can
[8:16] denominate. You can't denominate this.
[8:18] Right? So then you got the linox man and
[8:21] eagle. And as we pointed out many times
[8:23] before, look at the characteristics that
[8:25] we need every day that you and I need
[8:28] every day to make it through life is the
[8:30] boldness of the line. Mhm. Right. the
[8:33] burden bearer of the ox,
[8:35] the intelligence of the man, because you
[8:37] got to have the intelligence of God is
[8:40] the only thing that'll defeat Satan
[8:42] because Satan is the most intellectual
[8:44] man you'll ever know on the face of the
[8:46] earth outside of God. Amen. Okay. So,
[8:48] that's why we're no match for the devil
[8:50] cuz what? He matches up here. That's
[8:52] right. God takes the heart. Satan can't
[8:54] get to the heart if you're born again,
[8:55] but he can get to here, right? Lox man
[8:58] and eagle. The eagle is the what?
[9:00] Prophetic. The eagle is the as as we
[9:02] gave illustration before the lion is a
[9:06] very powerful animal. Yes, he is. But
[9:08] he's only about this tall. So if there's
[9:10] grass about this tall, he can't see very
[9:13] far, but he's very powerful. So they had
[9:15] a very powerful word, but it wasn't so
[9:17] much of revelation. They could see so
[9:19] far or understand. The ox is a little
[9:22] taller, but he's slow. Mhm. But he'll
[9:26] work. You know, a lion, they'll run for
[9:28] 500 yards and then they lay down. They,
[9:31] you know, they run out of steam. But an
[9:33] ox all day long. All day long, he just
[9:37] steady. And that's the way we supposed
[9:39] to be all day long. The man, the
[9:41] intelligence of man, now man stands up
[9:43] taller. He can see further.
[9:45] And then with our intelligence, we can
[9:47] go on up a little higher. Cuz you got to
[9:50] have, to me, this is perfect. The way
[9:52] God put it, you got to have the strength
[9:55] to start with.
[9:58] Then you take that, you don't do away
[9:59] with that and then then come to the next
[10:01] one. No, you keep adding. Keep you keep
[10:03] adding. You add then you add to that
[10:05] line. You add the strength that you can
[10:07] make it further and further and further
[10:09] and you can keep going. And you know
[10:10] what? If you have to pull somebody with
[10:12] you, you got something to pull them
[10:13] with. You know, uh you don't see a lion
[10:15] carrying a cart. No, no. But you do see
[10:19] an aux. You put something behind that
[10:21] option, he just keeps grinding and he
[10:23] just keeps going. All right? That's the
[10:24] way we are. Same way now with a man's
[10:26] intelligence,
[10:28] we come to a place now that the only way
[10:30] we can that we can go higher is to be
[10:32] the eagle. The eagle when he goes up, he
[10:34] can see this way, this way, this way,
[10:35] and this way. Okay? But with man's
[10:38] intelligence, we've got up into this
[10:39] realm.
[10:41] I say man's intelligence. I don't mean
[10:43] man. I mean God. with the intelligence
[10:45] of God through the man anointing. We now
[10:48] have come up into the eagle age
[10:51] and that's what we're talking about here
[10:52] in the four seal. The eagle age or the
[10:54] prophetic. It's a pale horse rider which
[10:57] is a mixed color. Uh there's a name
[11:01] already given here. And then we got to
[11:02] look at the rapture because there's no
[11:04] other combat beef past the fourth seal.
[11:07] Right. Right. Brother Bam says the
[11:09] rapture take place on the fourth seal.
[11:10] But whatever this characteristic, cuz we
[11:13] always say that and then we go on. If
[11:15] the rapture takes place on the four
[11:17] seal, there must be something in that
[11:18] seal that's going to rapture us. Amen.
[11:21] Right.
[11:24] Right. Right. Right. But you say, "What
[11:27] about 5, six, and seven?" We'll get to
[11:28] that in just a little while. But but we
[11:31] must see that that that brother Brandham
[11:33] something came to him in a revelation
[11:36] that right here on this fourth seal that
[11:38] the Holy Ghost come off the earth. Amen.
[11:41] Yes. In the Gentile age. Now he's going
[11:43] to go back to the Jews. Yes. Right after
[11:45] we leave. But this is what we're
[11:47] concerned about, right? We're concerned
[11:49] about this anointing, right? To get us
[11:52] out of here, right? And then whatever
[11:54] happens to the Jews, I don't you know,
[11:56] don't even worry about trying to figure
[11:57] it out because why do you need to figure
[11:59] it out? That's right. Sure, it's good to
[12:01] know these things because you can use
[12:02] them as types. Okay. But we must come to
[12:06] we must come to this last anointing
[12:10] before they can take that revelation. I
[12:12] say they two prophets, two Jewish
[12:14] prophets can take that Moses and Elijah
[12:18] anointing and go to Israel. They can't
[12:20] do it right here. Right. Right. Not
[12:23] enough word to get them out. Not enough
[12:24] word to rapture them because they've got
[12:26] to take a rapture. Right. Right. Here's
[12:28] where they've got to be to bring a group
[12:30] of people up. Right. In the prophetic
[12:33] realm. Mhm. And they we've had 50s
[12:35] something years since the prophet left.
[12:37] They're only going to have three and a
[12:38] half to understand quite a bit of what
[12:41] we have un tried to understand 50 years
[12:44] and not make a denomination out of it or
[12:46] some other idea. That's what I love
[12:48] about those two prophets. Brother Brham
[12:50] gets on that sixth seal and he said, "I
[12:52] had to walk out of the room." Well, man,
[12:53] you know why? Because they were the true
[12:54] prophets. They they they brother
[12:57] Brandham brought the truth and man has
[12:59] divided it into all different kind of
[13:01] factions. Yes. Two souls, seven thunder,
[13:03] all these uh the millenniums already
[13:06] here and all these different things came
[13:08] from his his message. But his message is
[13:10] true. These two prophets, they're
[13:13] bringing the word of God. Amen. And they
[13:15] got three and a half years. They've got
[13:16] one goal. You and I, our goal is to
[13:20] preach the gospel. And brother Ram said,
[13:21] "Let the chips fall where they may." Cuz
[13:23] there's no certain amount of people
[13:25] that's going to make it, Gentiles. But
[13:27] you got to know one thing's for sure.
[13:29] Them two prophets know that when they
[13:31] hit that 144,000 mark, they're done.
[13:34] Yeah. That's right. They're done.
[13:37] There's not 146,000.
[13:39] There's 144,000. And when they're
[13:42] finished, their message is over. Amen.
[13:44] Cuz there's nobody else going to be
[13:45] saved after that 144,000. So, what a
[13:48] message. When they start out, there's no
[13:50] doubt them two prophets are going to
[13:51] look in the book of Revelations and
[13:53] they're going to read that they're those
[13:55] two prophets and they've got,260
[13:57] days to get 144. See how precise that is
[14:01] with us. We don't know what time we got.
[14:03] We don't know how many people. We just
[14:05] We're Gentiles. We throw it out there.
[14:07] The rapture is going to happen. But they
[14:09] know one thing's for sure. They got to
[14:10] get to a certain place and they got to
[14:12] do it real fast. That's my turn, baby.
[14:15] Not the two little fuzzy one.
[14:18] They're my grandkids, too. But anyway,
[14:21] lion ox man and eagle.
[14:24] The first church age, I mean, sorry, the
[14:26] first seal shows
[14:29] justification because you got to go
[14:31] through just what brother Brown said.
[14:32] Never leave those three stages of the
[14:34] new birth. Never leave those because he
[14:37] started
[14:39] back in the 40s and when he got to the
[14:42] future home, he said, I preached the
[14:43] same thing to hope. So he, you know,
[14:45] there's some people in the message says
[14:46] that he done away with after the seals
[14:48] open, he done away with justification,
[14:50] sanctification. It was just you got it
[14:52] all when you got born again.
[14:55] Well, the future home was preached in
[14:57] 1964, which was 2 years or a year after
[14:59] the seals were preached. And it's kind
[15:01] of strange that he goes back and says,
[15:03] "I've taught these from the beginning,
[15:05] and I'm still taught them now." Even the
[15:07] going forth to the earth.
[15:11] Remember justification, sanctification.
[15:13] Justification under what? Mo I mean Noah
[15:16] washing wash the earth. Sanctification.
[15:19] Jesus came shed his blood. And then
[15:21] there's a a baptism coming of fire
[15:25] that's going to burn this earth off for
[15:26] us to live in. Okay. So there you got
[15:28] your three stages of grace.
[15:31] But in those three stages of grace, you
[15:34] have a fourth one because there's four
[15:38] combat beasts. There's four death
[15:41] messengers in Joel that eat the tree
[15:43] down. Pom worm, locust, caterpillar,
[15:48] and ankle can. Yeah, I don't like that
[15:49] word, so I don't even think about
[15:50] cankerworm. Those four. But you had to
[15:53] have four life messengers bringing it
[15:55] back, which was what? Luther under
[15:58] justification, western under
[15:59] sanctification, the baptism of the Holy
[16:01] Ghost. Remember what brother Dale's been
[16:03] teaching? The Holy Ghost come himself on
[16:04] the day of Pentecost. Right. Right. And
[16:07] then the word opening. Mhm.
[16:11] Listen, I want you to think about this.
[16:15] And I'm not one of them that from 47 to
[16:17] 63, we don't need that. We need 63.
[16:19] Like, no, you need it all because it's
[16:21] all a foundation for for what's coming
[16:23] up. Okay? But from 47 to 63 was not the
[16:27] opening of the word for our age. Right.
[16:29] Okay.
[16:31] That's right. Right. That word had
[16:33] already been open. That's right. Yes.
[16:35] Yes. Right. Is that all right? That
[16:38] brother Brandon, that's why it says he
[16:40] didn't come to bring something new until
[16:42] he come to 1963. He come to do a work of
[16:45] restoration to restore us back what was
[16:48] already. Listen,
[16:51] John Wesley preached sanctification,
[16:53] right? Brother Brown didn't been
[16:55] preaching no different than John Wesley.
[16:56] And John Wesley did it back in 1750.
[16:59] That's right. 200 300 something years
[17:01] ago. 400 years ago almost. So it's not
[17:04] something new from 47 to 63. It was a
[17:08] restoration back to what had been eat
[17:10] down by those four um worms or whatever
[17:14] you want to call them. Same bug, right?
[17:17] So what restored it was
[17:21] Luther's true justification,
[17:24] Mark I mean Wesley's true
[17:26] sanctification, the Pentecostal's true
[17:29] baptism of the Holy Ghost bringing the
[17:30] gifts back into church and then the word
[17:33] had to open
[17:35] in 1963. The word opened that light had
[17:38] never shone. Remember brother whipped
[17:40] the top off of the pyramid, looked down
[17:41] in there. Light had never shone on that.
[17:43] It wasn't that the word was not there.
[17:45] Yes, sir. That's right. The word was in
[17:48] there. It's just that light had never
[17:51] shown. Man had not come up to a place or
[17:53] a plateau.
[17:55] Man had not come to a place to where it
[17:58] could look down in the pyramid. Okay.
[18:00] And see the what? The unwritten part.
[18:02] The Bible's been written for years and
[18:03] years and years. John wrote this in AD
[18:06] 60 something, 80 something, even 8090.
[18:11] This was written 2,000 years ago.
[18:13] what we're talking about. What was
[18:15] written, this part right here that's
[18:16] shaking in front of you, right? That
[18:18] part was written by John 2,000 years
[18:21] ago. Yes. He was commissioned to write
[18:24] what he saw. Right. Not reveal it. Write
[18:27] what he saw. Okay. That's right. Cuz he
[18:29] said, "Look, come and see." And I
[18:32] looked. Yeah. So, all he was doing was
[18:34] he was scribing. He was he was writing
[18:36] down everything that he saw. Right.
[18:38] Okay.
[18:40] But now with the revelation that we
[18:42] have, it's not just written word. Now
[18:44] it's going to have to be I was thinking
[18:45] about this morning.
[18:48] Think about this.
[18:51] We might get into a little bit this
[18:52] afternoon, but when we get when we get
[18:55] to the future home, you're not going to
[18:57] need a Bible, right? Cuz the Bible's
[19:00] going to be there, right? The living
[19:03] people, right? I would say the
[19:05] millennium, but you got you foolish is
[19:07] not going to be in the millennium. So
[19:08] I'm saying future home. When we get in
[19:10] the future home, everything that this
[19:12] Bible wrote about, you said, "What about
[19:13] Judas?" I said, I said, "Everything
[19:16] that's written, we'll know there was a
[19:17] Judas, right?
[19:20] But we'll know what he done." That's
[19:21] right, son of a prediction. We'll know
[19:22] all the the bad things. We're going to
[19:24] know, but they're not going to be there.
[19:26] But what impacted Judas? Why was Judas
[19:30] who he was? It's because Jesus was who
[19:32] he was.
[19:34] Why was Balam who he was? Because Moses
[19:37] was who he was, right? Amen. Got that?
[19:41] What a revelation that is to me that you
[19:43] don't need a written Bible. The written
[19:45] Bible, the when we walk in that future
[19:47] home, you you can't see
[19:50] um in Revelations 19 or wherever said
[19:54] the books was open and then they were
[19:56] given this and given that. That's your
[19:58] foolish virgin. There's no names written
[20:00] in there, but that's all the foolish
[20:02] virgins from down the beginning of time.
[20:04] That's all the foolish virgin in that
[20:06] one scripture.
[20:08] And they're going to be walking, living,
[20:10] moving people that come right out of
[20:13] that word.
[20:15] I get to preaching and quit teaching.
[20:18] We'll do that this afternoon. But you
[20:19] see what I'm talking about? Why do you
[20:21] need a written B? The reason we need a
[20:22] written Bible now is because we can't
[20:24] see them.
[20:26] We see them by the eye of faith. That's
[20:28] right. But you're going to literally see
[20:31] the Bible open up. That's why the
[20:33] Bible's the eternal word of God. It's
[20:34] not going to be a written word that we
[20:36] we have to go back and and pay homage
[20:38] to. I'm sorry. We That's not what we're
[20:40] going to do. That's right. We're not
[20:42] going to have scrolls, right? Listen,
[20:44] the Bible said there's not even going to
[20:45] be a tabernacle there. Right. There's
[20:47] not going to be a tab. So, there's not
[20:48] going to be a scroll there. See, like
[20:50] now, the reason reason I thought about
[20:51] this is they they opened up a a museum
[20:54] here in Gainesville, General James Long
[20:57] Street, which was a a Confederate
[21:00] general right next to Robert E.
[21:03] and he moved to Gainesville. Well,
[21:05] they've got all of his writings and
[21:06] people just flocking in to read those
[21:08] old documents cuz he talked to
[21:10] presidents and different things and he
[21:12] had a, you know, he had a history,
[21:13] right? He was a he was a very power a
[21:15] good general, very good general. Um,
[21:17] General Roberty Lee called him the old
[21:18] waror, right? But he moved to
[21:20] Gainesville. Well, they've got all of
[21:21] his writings over in uh Israel now.
[21:24] You've got the Torah and you've got the
[21:26] real one. And you know, they say that
[21:27] thing comes up out of the ground.
[21:30] Bulletproof glass. this thick, you know,
[21:32] they're preserving it. They say that if
[21:34] there's an ever an attack that that
[21:36] thing goes down into like a bunker like
[21:38] 6 feet thick steel concrete. Why? To
[21:41] preserve a word of history.
[21:45] We're not here to preserve a word of
[21:46] history, right? We're making history,
[21:49] right? These seals are making history
[21:51] because even when the prophet of God
[21:53] preached them, none of us, I say none of
[21:56] us, we some of you were born, but none I
[21:59] was 3 years old, but none of us though
[22:01] had a revelation in 1963, right? That
[22:04] that's what was happening, right? We do
[22:06] now. That's right. Okay. So, that word
[22:09] was planted just like in the Bible, that
[22:12] word was planted and then it comes to
[22:14] fruition when we come alive and then the
[22:16] word comes alive in us. Then when we go
[22:18] to the future home, you don't need
[22:19] letters. You don't need a uh when he
[22:22] opened the fourth seal. We'll know what
[22:24] that is because we're going to
[22:25] experience it. Exactly. When you
[22:28] experience something, writing a book's
[22:30] good in a third person or a second
[22:32] person, you can read a book about
[22:33] something. But I've always said if you
[22:35] could become the composer, why Brother
[22:37] Ram say if you become the person that
[22:40] wrote the book, right? You'd understand.
[22:43] Exactly. Because if I gave you a a a
[22:45] book, if I gave you a book about me and
[22:47] my wife, we've been married 37 years.
[22:48] You don't know her. You don't know her.
[22:50] But I know her very well. But I write
[22:51] these little love things, you know,
[22:53] these little little things that we do
[22:55] that just between me and her. But if I
[22:56] give it to you, you say, "Oh, this is
[22:58] pretty good. This is all right." Yeah,
[23:00] this is okay. It's it's Yeah. Okay. So,
[23:03] they they have fun all 37 years. They
[23:05] had two kids and tell them story. But
[23:07] what if I was some way to transpose
[23:09] myself into you
[23:11] and you have the same mind that I did so
[23:13] that you could actually read between the
[23:16] lines. See what I'm talking about?
[23:18] That's what this says. When we have the
[23:20] mind of Christ, it brings not written
[23:21] words to us. We have to have written
[23:24] words to process it through our
[23:25] eyeballs. We have to. Right. But brother
[23:29] said even the most illiterate person can
[23:31] get a revelation. That's right. So that
[23:33] means somebody that can't read, but he
[23:35] hears
[23:37] and something strikes in his heart that
[23:39] he puts things together that God's
[23:42] already spoke in different ways in
[23:43] different times. Same way when we get to
[23:46] the future home, you look at these uh uh
[23:48] you know, we went through all this and
[23:50] we have
[23:52] I say we we're we're alive and remain.
[23:54] That's what we're going to talk about
[23:55] this afternoon. We which are alive and
[23:57] remain. Well, we're still here. As long
[24:00] as we don't have to go to your funeral
[24:02] or mine, we're still here, right? And we
[24:04] are still capable of receiving
[24:06] revelation from God. Amen. Amen. So, as
[24:09] we receive revelation from God, it
[24:12] becomes a part of us to where you don't
[24:15] see the book anymore. No, that's right.
[24:17] You see the person of the book. Okay?
[24:20] And if that person of the book is the
[24:21] Lord Jesus Christ and he is dwelling in
[24:25] us, right?
[24:26] Then what's the difference?
[24:30] Jesus said, "You're not far off when you
[24:31] say ye are God's." That's right. And
[24:33] whom the word comes to. All right.
[24:37] So we got the four combat beast. They're
[24:41] listen. They're earthly beast. Right.
[24:45] Right. These are all earthly beast.
[24:46] They're not It doesn't say angel,
[24:50] cherubam, saraphim. Right. Right. It
[24:53] says lion. We can relate to that ox,
[24:56] man, and eagle. So, it's something we
[24:57] can relate to on the earth. All right.
[25:00] When we get to heaven, when we get to
[25:03] the future home, there's not going to be
[25:05] this very lion walking around. You
[25:08] understand what I'm saying? It's going
[25:09] to be the people. Yes. It's going to be
[25:10] all of us. It's not going to be You're
[25:12] not going to see the But you what you're
[25:14] going to do, you're going to see these
[25:15] characteristics when we talk about the
[25:17] age we came out of. Exactly. Amen. When
[25:20] we talk about the age that we came out
[25:22] of, that's going to come alive. That's
[25:23] right. To me, that's what these seals
[25:25] are. This is the word. Now, the word's
[25:27] never been dead, but we have so we I say
[25:30] we we have so eroded it or so put our
[25:34] own thoughts and ideas and and picked
[25:36] and choose and you know till we have we
[25:39] have suppressed it. Right. Yes. Right.
[25:43] Right. to where now though that we see
[25:45] that you look at all these
[25:48] it's going to take
[25:52] right here it's very important
[25:55] because what is pale I told you before
[25:58] take take red
[26:01] or take white remember you remember your
[26:05] your horse riders white black and red
[26:11] I can do that cuz I got plenty of paint
[26:13] cuz I'm a beekeeper and I get all the
[26:14] paint I need. So, I I uh I have all
[26:17] these different colors, so I'll mix them
[26:18] up. M It's a It's a putrid
[26:21] grally grayish purple. It's got all
[26:24] these different It's pale.
[26:28] So, what is the rapture?
[26:34] The rapture is all three of these
[26:38] mixed together, right? What is the
[26:40] opening of the word? You can't have the
[26:42] You can't have the headstone opening of
[26:44] the word with just justification.
[26:46] That's right. Cuz that just tells you
[26:48] that you're a sinner. That's right.
[26:49] You're starting in your Christian walk.
[26:51] You're just down here. You know, you're
[26:53] a baby.
[26:54] Sanctification. You getting everything
[26:56] cleaned up. You're getting the house in
[26:58] order. You moving stuff around. You
[26:59] getting stuff throwing stuff out. But
[27:01] the new birth comes and sure that gives
[27:03] you a right to the word of God, but it
[27:08] doesn't give you and and that's what is
[27:11] you have to listen to what brother Brown
[27:13] said. I was reading a token yesterday.
[27:16] The token in the end time is not
[27:18] different than any other time because
[27:20] the token is the Holy Ghost. Right.
[27:22] Amen. Okay. The token was the Holy Ghost
[27:24] in this age. That's right. But the full
[27:26] token, right? The fullness of what's
[27:29] coming. That's right. Came in this age.
[27:31] Right. Right. Okay. That entitles you to
[27:35] the full token. It it it being in this
[27:37] message of the hour and getting a
[27:39] revelation. It it doesn't take it it
[27:42] didn't take Martin Luther anywhere but
[27:44] the justification into a grave. Wesley
[27:47] sanctification and the grave. You see
[27:49] what I'm saying? Yes. Right. So the full
[27:52] token the full token is the fullness.
[27:54] It's all these mixed together
[27:57] around the word of God. Exactly.
[28:00] And I don't have room to write that, but
[28:02] that's not just written word. That's
[28:04] revelation. Amen. There's no prevailing
[28:07] power, the prophet said, outside of a
[28:09] revelation. Amen. Cuz Satan can
[28:12] impersonate everything but a real true
[28:15] drop down in your heart revelation. It's
[28:18] like a pipe that runs right down to your
[28:20] heart and Satan can't get to it. Now, if
[28:21] you remember, Brother said if it stays
[28:23] up here, he said Satan can play with it
[28:26] cuz this is his battleground, right? He
[28:27] has pro He has this part he can play
[28:29] with. That's right. God give him that.
[28:32] That's right. In the garden, he g He
[28:34] said, "Okay, cuz remember brother R says
[28:36] Satan chose the brain. God chose the
[28:39] heart." Right. Right. So that's where
[28:41] your greatest battle is. It's up here.
[28:43] It's not It shouldn't be down here.
[28:44] That's right. You're either one or the
[28:46] other in the heart. I'm not pointing at
[28:48] the heart. I'm talking about the very
[28:49] heart of you, the center of you. All
[28:52] right.
[28:54] a couple more points and then tomorrow,
[28:55] next Sunday, we'll well, next Sunday,
[28:57] Brother Luis is going to bring the uh
[28:59] he's going to bring a uh resurrection
[29:02] uh uh Sunday school class
[29:07] and then the next Sunday, remember that
[29:09] other brother's coming to be with us.
[29:10] So, we'll pick this up the next Sunday
[29:13] on the four seal. But, let's get the uh
[29:16] let's read it. I hope everybody got
[29:19] that's kind of a background. That's
[29:20] that's what we're up to now. We're up to
[29:22] now to where
[29:27] um
[29:28] Deanna is taking that what is that
[29:30] milestone thing she's anyway they're
[29:32] testing her and they are time testing
[29:37] her
[29:39] okay you got so many problems you got so
[29:41] many minutes to complete that problem
[29:42] it's putting pressure on them you know
[29:44] trying to get them but what is what is
[29:46] the and and and could be bragging again
[29:49] she's very good in math like her
[29:51] grandpa. Okay.
[29:54] And she understands it. She likes
[29:55] numbers. She loves numbers. So anyway,
[29:58] but anyway, she goes and she takes
[30:00] everything that she had learned,
[30:03] right? Mhm. Everything that she had
[30:05] learned when she sits down that one 5
[30:07] minutes, they've got to complete 20
[30:08] problems in 5 minutes. She takes
[30:11] everything that she's learned and she
[30:12] brings it right there to that one place
[30:15] and she takes that test. Right. She's
[30:18] got so much time to take it. Mhm. We're
[30:21] at the end time. We have so much time to
[30:23] take these tests. Okay. And then what we
[30:27] do though is is what if the teacher was
[30:29] teaching her something and then teaching
[30:31] me something different? Her math, me
[30:33] English,
[30:35] but she gets the English test and I get
[30:37] the math test. I have no background to
[30:40] go on. I have no revelation
[30:43] of what of what she's been
[30:46] understanding. You understand what I'm
[30:48] saying? Cuz we can't have these past
[30:50] revelations. That's right. The
[30:52] revelation must be the fullness of the
[30:53] word or we're not going to take a body
[30:55] change. That's right. We got so much
[30:58] time to do it in and we've got to take
[30:59] everything that we've had before.
[31:03] That's why if you don't know that you
[31:05] went through these stages, I I'm not
[31:07] saying you don't have a new birth. I'm
[31:09] just saying maybe you just need to go
[31:10] back and think. That's right. That's
[31:12] right. That one day when you truly God
[31:16] forgive you of every sin you had done.
[31:18] Yes. And you walked in that and could
[31:22] walk in it for years. Mhm. Hello.
[31:27] Okay. And then you come to a spot to
[31:30] where things that listen the things that
[31:32] you did you didn't do anymore. Now I
[31:34] don't say they don't bother you.
[31:37] But then it comes to a time where they
[31:38] don't bother you. That's right. You see
[31:40] you got to grow just like a human grows.
[31:42] That's right. I mean, we we guide our
[31:44] kids the best we can. The Holy Ghost
[31:46] guides us the best he can, but he's a
[31:47] gentleman. He'll let us do some things
[31:49] dumb. That's right. Well, I'm sorry.
[31:51] He'll let me do things dumb. I don't
[31:52] know about y'all, but he let me do
[31:54] things dumb because I'm a human. But
[31:56] when you come on down to here and then
[32:00] when that burner comes in and burns all
[32:02] that old nature, see, that's what that
[32:03] third seal was. What? That third seal
[32:05] was a black horse. Darkness, death.
[32:08] Right. You have to come to a death
[32:10] because the dead in Christ shall rise
[32:12] first. That's right. I I want to bring
[32:15] that even this afternoon a little bit
[32:16] more. The dead in Christ. You got to be
[32:18] dead in Christ. That's right. Here.
[32:20] That's right. Before you go there. Amen.
[32:22] And you're not coming back here if you
[32:24] don't be dead in Christ here. Because
[32:26] Christians don't die. That's right.
[32:29] Christians die here. That's right. Amen.
[32:32] Christians die here. That's right. They
[32:34] don't die there. They die here. While
[32:36] you're alive. To me, that's the whole
[32:38] paradox. That's the whole secret. The
[32:40] whole secret was that there was a man
[32:42] come down into a womb of a woman with
[32:45] eternal life in his soul. Walked on the
[32:47] face of the earth for 33 years and half
[32:50] one/tenth of the people in the world
[32:52] didn't even know who he was. That's
[32:53] right. And then when he did reveal
[32:55] himself, look what all happened. Now,
[32:57] I'm not saying the church ages. I'm
[32:58] talking about all the denominational
[32:59] junk and ideas and and all that came out
[33:01] of all that.
[33:04] Eternity walked on the face of the
[33:05] earth. Amen.
[33:07] And if you're born again, eternity is
[33:09] walking on the face of the earth.
[33:13] It's just what I said. We keep thinking
[33:15] something's coming, right? We keep
[33:17] thinking that something's going to be
[33:18] yonder.
[33:20] We'll see. So anyway,
[33:23] so you come to a place that that listen,
[33:26] things bother me that I used to do, but
[33:29] I don't yield to them anymore. I used to
[33:32] yield to them. It didn't bother me to go
[33:33] in and buy well I didn't drink beer but
[33:36] other things bothered me and I would go
[33:38] do them willingly not having any
[33:40] reservation I would just go do them
[33:42] right
[33:44] now that don't bother me anymore
[33:46] things come back to your head just spit
[33:48] it out let it go but the new birth is
[33:50] the the real revelation of the new birth
[33:52] is is that this word is starting to come
[33:55] alive and you're starting you say well I
[33:57] hadn't got a revelation in in months
[34:02] Maybe neither have I. Okay. But at least
[34:04] you just keep reading and then all of a
[34:06] sudden one day while you're in this
[34:08] subject
[34:10] something comes. Brother Harris was
[34:12] preaching one night
[34:14] and he said just one word. He wasn't
[34:16] even preaching on predestination. This
[34:18] is how it works with me. He wasn't even
[34:19] preaching but he said the word
[34:21] predestination
[34:23] and went on. And when that word
[34:24] predestination, it was like it was the
[34:26] loudest word he spoke the whole sermon.
[34:28] That's right. Because you know what it
[34:30] was to me and I had never seen it before
[34:32] in my life. I was sitting there watching
[34:35] in the front row where I sat. I was
[34:36] sitting there looking at him and there
[34:38] was a book, brother Louise. A book just
[34:39] opened up like this and it just kept
[34:41] unfolding
[34:43] and there was words written on it but I
[34:45] wasn't f I couldn't read them but I knew
[34:48] what God was doing. He was revealing
[34:49] predestination to me folding unfolding
[34:52] and kept unfolding and it just went
[34:54] right on and just faded on around.
[34:56] That's it. And to me that's to me then
[34:59] the revelation of predestination came.
[35:01] Well, he wasn't even preaching on that
[35:02] subject matter.
[35:04] So that's maybe the same way with you.
[35:06] Maybe it's like I said said before some
[35:08] of you that hadn't been here. You preach
[35:10] an hour and 15 minutes or an hour or
[35:12] hour and a half. You only going to get
[35:14] about 15 minutes. Mhm. But let it be
[35:17] your 15 minutes. Right. Cuz I might get
[35:20] 15 minutes in the first part and you
[35:22] might get 15 in the middle and you might
[35:23] get 15 in the last part. Okay. Let's
[35:26] just be real honest. What did brother
[35:29] Dale preach on last Sunday? And what
[35:30] scripture did he read?
[35:35] You don't know what scripture you read?
[35:38] Were you listening? Sure you were
[35:40] listening. And I'm not being mean. I'm
[35:43] just saying, look, that's right. Cuz
[35:45] somebody brought that to my attention
[35:46] yesterday when we were talking. I asked
[35:49] somebody who where he went last Sunday
[35:53] about what somebody was preaching and he
[35:55] said uh you know he stumbled around but
[35:57] then what happened? It comes back to
[35:59] you. Yeah, that's right. You get it in
[36:01] that subconscious.
[36:03] You think man what am I doing in truth?
[36:08] Have you never felt that way? Am I the
[36:09] only one? Am I the only one? Bob, am I
[36:13] the only one? Brother, you've been
[36:14] around a long time. They some days you
[36:17] go
[36:19] that must not got that wasn't for me or
[36:21] I didn't get it. One of the two you know
[36:22] that just but you know what though
[36:25] somebody comes out and you being a
[36:26] minister now you know you go to places
[36:28] and you see people yeah now looking at
[36:31] the walls and then one person walks out
[36:33] and says I've been thinking on that all
[36:35] week and you answered my question. That
[36:38] was who it was for people. It wasn't for
[36:40] the whole place. It was one person.
[36:41] That's right. What brother Brian say? He
[36:43] went to Chicago, had a 3-day meeting. He
[36:46] told Brother Matson Boz, he said, "I got
[36:48] the person I come for the first night."
[36:51] But we continually had our services.
[36:53] People were healed, saved, filled with
[36:54] the Holy Ghost. That's right. But he
[36:56] went for one person. That's why this is
[36:58] a gentile thing. It's for one person.
[37:00] It's an individual affair with God. So,
[37:05] with these seals, it's the same way. You
[37:07] got to get I can sit here and talk about
[37:09] this and talk about this and talk about
[37:10] this, but you got to pray that God gives
[37:12] you a revelation of what's going on.
[37:15] So, we got the fourth seal real quick
[37:18] and then we'll go. It is the eagle
[37:20] anointing. So, it's going to be the
[37:22] highest, the apex. It's going to be way
[37:24] up here in the clouds, not baby form
[37:27] anymore. It's going to take all these
[37:29] powers together to bring that word of
[37:32] God cuz you can't get a revelation. And
[37:33] now look, you can get an understanding,
[37:36] but you can't get a revelation without
[37:37] the Holy Ghost. That's right. Cuz that
[37:39] word is so hid. So you can get Now what
[37:41] I'm saying, you can get an understanding
[37:43] or a background just like I did with
[37:45] brother Harris. But he said that one
[37:47] word predestination and that opened up
[37:48] all the predestination that I needed to
[37:50] know. You understand what I'm talking
[37:52] about for the time. Yes. But he wasn't
[37:54] preaching on it. So you can, you know,
[37:55] just keep plugging, keep putting it in
[37:56] and then one day something, you know, 6
[37:58] months from now something will pop up
[37:59] and go, that's why brother Dale said
[38:02] that. Right. That's right. It might be
[38:04] one sentence. That's right. Has it ever
[38:06] happened to you? Come on. It's really
[38:07] It's happened. It's because you know
[38:09] what it is? It's God bringing it to you
[38:11] in the time. I'm going to tell you this
[38:12] one thing and this is so profound.
[38:16] Brother Brown prayed for a woman. You
[38:18] think how the and I'm still working on
[38:20] dimensions. I was working on a little
[38:21] bit last night. You take what's going on
[38:24] that we can't see. Brother Brown prayed
[38:26] for a woman. She didn't get healed that
[38:28] night. Remember,
[38:30] she goes home, she's washing the dishes,
[38:34] she's doing whatever, and all of a
[38:35] sudden, she has this warm feeling come
[38:37] over. Weeks later, this warm feeling
[38:40] comes over. She runs and tells the
[38:42] neighbor, and the neighbor says, "Well,
[38:43] I got my healing, too." You know what
[38:45] brother Brown said about that? He said,
[38:47] "The angel came through the community
[38:50] that night or that day." That's right.
[38:52] Now, come on, people. The angel. Now,
[38:54] why didn't God just heal her right then?
[38:56] He wanted to show us what you and I even
[38:58] in our daily lives, God can come down
[39:00] and just go just give you and it's an
[39:03] angel that comes by. He said that angel
[39:05] came through that community at that time
[39:08] and that's when they got their healing
[39:10] and boy you that's pretty profound. You
[39:13] start thinking about that we ain't
[39:14] alone.
[39:15] We are not alone. God never left us
[39:18] alone. He never will leave us alone. So
[39:20] anyway to me that's wonderful. We think
[39:23] we don't get something all of a sudden.
[39:26] So, it's a pale mix horse. There's a
[39:28] name. And then we're going to take a
[39:30] rapture. Let's go.
[39:33] See you in two weeks. L got the floor
[39:36] next time.
