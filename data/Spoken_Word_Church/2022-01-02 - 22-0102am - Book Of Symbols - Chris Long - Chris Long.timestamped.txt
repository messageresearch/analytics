[3:43] given us to come and gather around your
[3:44] word

[3:49] bother you
[3:51] many times you woke us up during the
[3:52] middle of the night to pray and
[3:55] our pastors taught us it's okay just go
[3:57] ahead and pray
[3:58] he'll put you back to sleep
[4:01] but i tell you what father
[4:03] your word is here and it's strong and it
[4:05] is life

[4:32] bless the word here today bless brother
[4:34] chris he's come a long way to bring a
[4:36] message to us father let us be attentive
[4:39] send your word to us by revelation
[4:40] father anoint our ears that we can hear
[4:42] your word as you anoint his word that
[4:45] comes from
[4:46] that heart that you've placed those
[4:47] words upon
[4:49] we ask these things now father and bless
[4:51] the opening and reading of your word
[4:52] here this day
[4:54] we asked it in your name amen
[4:57] we're going to read this morning in
[4:59] proverbs
[5:00] 16 16.
[5:04] i was studying a little bit through
[5:06] proverbs and and
[5:08] through the bible period because it's
[5:09] all god's word but
[5:12] uh i went back over proverbs and i'll
[5:14] tell you i've been blessed being here to
[5:16] hear the word that has been taught
[5:19] and i'm gonna tell you i was blessed to
[5:21] set in brother wade sunday school class
[5:24] and to hear brother dale
[5:26] you can't get any better
[5:28] okay
[5:29] two teachers
[5:31] and the nut didn't fall far from the
[5:32] tree back there brother wade i'll tell
[5:34] you that
[5:36] but i went back over proverbs and i was
[5:38] amazed at how much the lord just opened
[5:40] up to me and said this is about wisdom
[5:42] you need wisdom you got to have wisdom
[5:45] hope don't get it by itself
[5:48] but you got to get in that word and
[5:49] become part of it now as we read
[5:51] proverbs 16
[5:53] 16
[5:56] how much better is it to get wisdom than
[5:59] gold and to get understanding rather to
[6:01] be chosen than silver
[6:11] pride goeth before destruction and
[6:13] unhaughty spirit before fall
[6:23] he that handleth a matter
[6:25] wisely shall find good
[6:27] and whoso trust us in the lord happy is
[6:29] he
[6:34] the sweetness of the lips increases
[6:36] learning
[6:37] understanding is a wellspring of life
[6:40] and to him that hath it but the
[6:42] instruction of fools is folly
[6:51] pleasant words are as in honeycomb sweet
[6:53] to the soul and health to the bones
[7:03] he that laboreth labeth for himself for
[7:06] his mouth craveth it of
[7:15] a him man soul strife and a whisper
[7:19] separate chief friends separate cheap
[7:29] he friends his eyes to the device to
[7:32] devise forward things moving his lips he
[7:35] bringeth evil to passion
[7:43] he that is slow to anger is better than
[7:45] the mighty and he that ruleth his spirit
[7:48] than he that taketh a city
[7:51] the lot is cast into the lap but the
[7:54] whole dispersion thereof is of the lord
[7:58] amen you may be seated
[8:01] thank you

[16:10] amen do you really want to see him
[16:12] why just turn around and shake your
[16:13] brother or sister's hand
[16:16] that's the plan of god i just know it is
[16:18] amen we'll read about it in first
[16:20] corinthians 12 if you give me a chance
[16:23] says god bless you god bless your
[16:24] brother amen thank you
[16:27] it's a pleasure to be here it's uh
[16:29] it's always good like i say to be home
[16:32] with that's a favorite part of the
[16:33] holidays for me
[16:35] i mean i know there's this a lot of
[16:37] controversy and conflict over what we
[16:40] call christmas christmas is not the to
[16:43] me it's not the exchanging of gifts
[16:46] it's the fellowship that you get to have
[16:49] with friends and family
[16:51] and of course the food
[16:54] we like to sit around the table don't we
[16:55] so let's sit around the table this
[16:57] morning and
[16:58] you know
[16:59] if if you're not real hungry
[17:01] just just get some finger food
[17:04] but if you're starving to death there's
[17:06] prime rib available
[17:08] and if you're a vegetarian eat all the
[17:10] vegetables you want
[17:11] it's all good for you amen you love the
[17:14] lord amen amen it's a pleasure to be in
[17:16] the house the lord would you just sit
[17:17] down for just a second i want to uh it
[17:20] came to me as the brother was mentioning
[17:22] and i i think i heard this right
[17:24] it's the b team is the b team here
[17:30] june sister june are you here as a b
[17:32] team
[17:36] i think the b team is
[17:39] considered a derogatory remark but but
[17:42] but wait a minute wait a minute
[17:44] god's word fixes that right up
[17:48] you think the b team is second string
[17:50] right
[17:50] well let's see what the prophet said i
[17:52] didn't give this one to anderson because
[17:53] it come to me when the brother said that
[17:56] straight is the gate 3 1 of 59
[17:59] started in the paragraph 58 brother
[18:00] brown says lot didn't think
[18:04] watch the a and the b team now lot
[18:06] didn't think that he was going to
[18:07] backslide
[18:10] but he went to looking towards sodom
[18:12] where things were easy
[18:15] and there's many times that we look
[18:16] towards the easy way
[18:19] i'll join this certain certain church
[18:21] and you see nobody will say anything
[18:23] against it because it's the biggest
[18:24] church in the city
[18:26] the easy way
[18:29] i mean it's interesting why the way he's
[18:30] defining the easy way
[18:33] many times we do that
[18:36] when we're wrong he says
[18:38] now this is going to make more sense in
[18:40] this paragraph here in just a second
[18:41] remember if you follow christ
[18:44] you'll be hated by people
[18:47] for all that live godly in christ jesus
[18:50] suffer persecutions and if you come to
[18:53] christ
[18:54] you'll not come by any church or any
[18:57] denomination or any creed you'll come by
[18:59] the blood
[19:03] that's the only avenue in
[19:06] you cannot bring no one with
[19:09] you'll come alone
[19:12] stand on your own confession
[19:14] and your own faith
[19:17] you'll not ride in on the pastor
[19:20] or on your mother's faith you'll come as
[19:22] an individual when you come to god and
[19:25] many times we make those foolish choices
[19:28] ooh
[19:30] you you may not realize that but i'm
[19:32] getting to the b team
[19:34] what if lot
[19:37] when he's seen everything easy he saw
[19:40] where there was much money and much
[19:41] popularity because he'd be a stranger
[19:44] and a smart man educated a lot of
[19:46] psychology and he could do certain
[19:48] things and yet maintain his religion he
[19:51] thought i've got faith in god so i'll
[19:53] just go down into sodom and i'll make
[19:55] some extra money and i'll become a great
[19:57] man maybe a wonderful preacher see
[20:01] you have to make a choice
[20:04] you have a choice to make
[20:06] and the lady has a choice to make
[20:10] the lady is you folks
[20:13] i'll go down to this certain church
[20:14] there oh everybody in town thinks this
[20:16] is the most why the mayor but he's not
[20:20] the mayor of lula so we can't we're not
[20:22] we're not reputing the mayor
[20:25] why the mayor of the city belongs to
[20:27] this church now he could belong to a
[20:29] church that was really good
[20:32] what's wrong with the one we're at
[20:36] but still you have to judge that church
[20:40] and its people by the scriptures
[20:43] sometimes they go because it's a popular
[20:46] way that people dress better they go to
[20:49] a certain places and there's where
[20:51] we make a fatal mistake
[20:55] now notice this
[20:57] here's the a and the b team
[20:59] watch how god
[21:01] looks at the b team
[21:04] and abraham the only thing he could do
[21:06] was take
[21:08] second choice
[21:11] and sometimes the second choice
[21:14] is better than first
[21:16] if it's took like that
[21:19] unquote
[21:20] i've i've i've known about this
[21:23] portion of the message in this quote
[21:26] since
[21:27] oh way way way back in the early 90s
[21:32] because something happened to me and i i
[21:34] i was thinking about how the lord deals
[21:37] with his children
[21:39] and and then god had me put on a series
[21:42] and i believe that this straight is the
[21:44] gate may be found in the series israel
[21:46] in the church or one of those or the
[21:48] church one not the church but okay
[21:52] and i heard that
[21:54] statement
[21:55] and i said
[21:56] with second choice ain't that bad
[22:01] because abraham here is being forced to
[22:04] make a choice
[22:06] now abraham could have took sodom
[22:08] and the fertile valley and the flowing
[22:10] river and the green pastures
[22:13] and if you've ever watched any dramas
[22:15] that the hollywood has produced about
[22:17] abraham when he makes the turn away from
[22:19] sodom they suffer
[22:21] it's dry as a bone it's
[22:23] there's no water anywhere there's no
[22:25] food the animals are dying and
[22:28] people are starting to question abraham
[22:31] are you sure god said
[22:37] you're being presented with the same
[22:39] question this morning
[22:40] so am i
[22:42] so i just thought brother i'd
[22:44] mention that
[22:47] so let's go bt
[22:50] come on
[22:51] amen
[22:53] let's go
[22:56] and i'm not into sports anymore
[22:59] but you know who was a second stringer
[23:02] until the first stringer got hurt
[23:05] tom brady
[23:07] probably the greatest quarterback of all
[23:08] time and i'm not a tom brady fan so
[23:10] nobody get upset
[23:12] i'm just i just have the knowledge that
[23:14] that's how it worked out
[23:17] that's right it was sitting there all
[23:18] the time
[23:21] waiting
[23:23] for the opportunity
[23:25] and brothers and sisters
[23:27] guess what
[23:29] the presentation of god's word for the
[23:31] hour we live in is
[23:33] is granting to you personally
[23:36] the opportunity now to do something
[23:40] about what you've been given
[23:43] but you didn't get it two years ago or
[23:45] five
[23:47] not 10 or 12 or 50. you got it before
[23:50] the foundation of the world but god is
[23:53] waiting till this time
[23:55] for it to be manifested
[23:57] and i believe he wants us to do that job
[24:00] so with that if you'd stand for the
[24:01] reading of the word
[24:04] i think we will go to first corinthians
[24:06] 12 if
[24:07] and so that way i can read out of
[24:09] ephesians
[24:10] while you're seated
[24:12] everybody knows this scripture i quote
[24:14] it
[24:14] we repeat it
[24:16] we know it but i'd like to put some
[24:19] emphasis on it today if we could
[24:21] along with other things in the scripture
[24:23] so first corinthians 12
[24:26] and we'll start with verse
[24:28] 12.
[24:29] we'll read down to verse 20. all right
[24:31] is everybody feeling all right
[24:34] if anybody's not feeling well come on up
[24:36] we'll pray for you before we start
[24:37] preaching
[24:38] and by the time we get done you'll be
[24:40] all right
[24:43] for as the body is one
[24:46] and half many members
[24:49] and all the members of that one body
[24:52] being many
[24:53] are one body
[24:55] so also is christ
[24:58] for by one spirit are we all baptized
[25:00] into one body whether we are be jews or
[25:03] gentiles whether we be bond or free and
[25:06] have been all made to drink into one
[25:10] spirit
[25:12] for the body is not one member but many
[25:15] if the foot shall say because i am not
[25:17] the hand i am not of the body is it
[25:20] therefore not of the body
[25:22] well it is
[25:24] and if the ear shall say because i am
[25:26] not the i i am not of the body is that
[25:29] therefore not of the body no
[25:32] if the whole body were an eye
[25:34] where were the hearing
[25:37] okay i want you to get this
[25:40] okay if the whole we're hearing
[25:45] where were the smelling
[25:48] but now have god set the members every
[25:51] one of them in the body as it hath
[25:53] pleased him
[25:55] and if they were all one member
[25:59] where were the body but now
[26:03] are they many members yet
[26:05] one
[26:06] body let's pray father
[26:08] we are so grateful and thankful i am so
[26:11] grateful and thankful lord that you've
[26:13] given us another opportunity lord for
[26:16] we've been told by prophecy father that
[26:19] there will come a time and it seems like
[26:21] we're just so close lord where they'll
[26:24] want to close the doors of places like
[26:27] this
[26:27] where people come to receive from you
[26:30] lord because
[26:32] the powers that will be in charge
[26:36] don't think you exist
[26:39] and father
[26:41] it makes perfect sense to me because
[26:44] there is no explanation for you lord
[26:47] no mortal man could
[26:50] come close to being able to explain
[26:54] you
[26:56] as a being who had no beginning it's
[26:58] almost impossible for us to think lord
[27:01] how that could be
[27:05] and we'll have no end
[27:07] but father you've invited us this
[27:09] morning into you
[27:12] and once lord we come to the realization
[27:15] that there's a place at the table for us
[27:17] lord
[27:19] and you've placed our name there father
[27:22] and it's in you lord then while we know
[27:26] in our uh body lord of time that we
[27:30] would think well we had a
[27:32] beginning we can have no end
[27:36] if we'll just
[27:39] get in you
[27:40] bless your children for their efforts
[27:42] lord for being here this morning
[27:44] i pray father that you'd give revelation
[27:46] also to those father on the
[27:49] on the stream lord out there in the
[27:52] in in the world father
[27:54] of the church lord i pray that you'd
[27:56] help us this morning father
[28:00] sometimes second choice
[28:03] is better
[28:04] we've made it this morning father we're
[28:06] here we give you all the praise and the
[28:08] honor and the glory and the wonderful
[28:10] and in the precious name of jesus christ
[28:13] amen god bless you may be seated
[28:16] now
[28:18] i could preach on every syllable there
[28:20] but i want you to uh come to an
[28:22] understanding as we move into this
[28:24] morning's message and again i'm i'm not
[28:26] straying off of where we were at on
[28:28] friday night i'm just going to continue
[28:30] to move forward
[28:32] if you remember we were
[28:34] quoting out of revelations 5 how that
[28:37] how that uh
[28:38] nobody could see that there was no man
[28:41] worthy and and john or no one could see
[28:44] how it was going to be possible and then
[28:47] of course uh uh one one of the elders
[28:50] cries out uh
[28:53] god's got this
[28:56] behold the lion of the tribe of judah
[28:59] hath prevailed right
[29:02] he's he's prevailed he prevailed means
[29:05] overcome
[29:07] now we have to overcome ourselves
[29:10] can i read can i say that again
[29:13] brother boyd got it we have to overcome
[29:15] ourselves
[29:17] because we are our greatest enemy
[29:20] and by overcoming ourselves we are
[29:23] the true
[29:24] overcomer
[29:27] of the day we live in in revelations 3
[29:29] 21
[29:30] gives us
[29:32] the recipe
[29:35] to him that overcometh will i grant to
[29:38] sit with me in my throne even as i also
[29:41] am overcome and sat down with my father
[29:43] and his throne
[29:45] how many thrones we got
[29:48] well we know that the first throne was
[29:50] in heaven
[29:51] the second throne was in christ and the
[29:54] third throne is in the heart of man
[29:56] but as we mentioned on friday
[29:58] it could be a throne
[30:01] and it was made to be a throne room
[30:05] but who's sitting on it
[30:08] because you know the god of this evil
[30:10] age
[30:12] has tried to set this up to be satan's
[30:14] eden
[30:16] and he wants to sit in that chair
[30:21] but it's god's chair
[30:23] that's why in thessalonians he says i'm
[30:25] going to
[30:26] oh i'm going to be like i'm all raised
[30:28] up higher than god i'm going to be i'm
[30:29] going to get higher than the stars it
[30:31] says in isaiah
[30:32] i'm going to be god
[30:35] good luck
[30:37] because it ain't happening
[30:39] but where do you and i come in
[30:41] seems like a battle that's between god
[30:43] and satan well there's a conflict
[30:46] remember i've preached that here before
[30:51] between god and satan
[30:54] god's here on the right
[30:57] this would be your right
[31:01] satan's here on your left and if there's
[31:04] a conflict
[31:06] between
[31:09] god and satan who is it it's you
[31:12] it's me
[31:13] we're the ones in between
[31:15] and god has set up man's heart to be a
[31:18] throne room
[31:20] now you say well god can take that
[31:22] throne he's a gentleman
[31:26] it is his throne room
[31:28] he brought it into existence
[31:30] but he's made you and i a free moral
[31:31] agent
[31:33] amen
[31:34] so there's a chair
[31:37] a throne is a place
[31:39] of power and authority
[31:42] there's a place in you
[31:45] designated by god
[31:48] of power and authority
[31:51] but you choose
[31:54] as a man thinketh
[31:56] in his heart
[31:58] so is he and so
[32:01] is he
[32:02] who rules and reigns on that throne
[32:08] god's word is
[32:10] seemingly completely contrary
[32:12] to the world we live in
[32:15] prove it
[32:17] there's where the contrariness comes in
[32:19] you can't
[32:21] prove god
[32:24] you believe god
[32:28] faith is
[32:31] something
[32:34] that you believe
[32:37] in which there's no proof
[32:38] that's the dictionary i'm just quoting
[32:40] the dictionary to you now
[32:43] so that's why
[32:46] abraham seemed to be a stumbling block
[32:49] wait a minute
[32:51] i thought you said god talk to you
[32:54] did i not hear something mentioned about
[32:56] a land flowing with milken
[33:01] abraham look where we're at
[33:04] but abraham believed god
[33:07] and if we're going to be the royal seed
[33:10] of abraham amen
[33:12] we're going to believe god
[33:14] no matter what your eyeballs see
[33:18] no matter what your ears hear
[33:20] or your tongue tastes amen
[33:26] and here paul in first corinthians 12 is
[33:28] addressing the body and and if you're
[33:30] really focused on every word that paul
[33:33] gave there you'd understand that paul is
[33:36] trying to convey that this
[33:39] should not be
[33:41] and it was not meant to be
[33:43] a
[33:44] a body that that is uh out of joint
[33:50] a body that's conflicted
[33:55] a body that is confused
[33:58] but paul is reading into it how it
[34:01] becomes confusing to people because they
[34:04] begin to misunderstand the body and its
[34:07] use
[34:10] i hear you brother
[34:12] yeah but you're not all ears
[34:14] some people like me are but
[34:19] i can see what you mean but we're not
[34:21] all eyes
[34:24] now i think it's particularly
[34:26] interesting the way paul in first
[34:28] corinthians 12 was inspired by god to
[34:31] lay it out
[34:32] and then the day you and i live in
[34:35] we're being told that there are only two
[34:38] important parts of the body
[34:41] the mouth
[34:43] that god spoke through
[34:46] and your ears
[34:48] that you should hear him in
[34:50] but paul says wait a minute
[34:53] that's not all there is to this body
[34:57] this body needs to be complete
[35:00] you're still with me
[35:02] all right
[35:03] so then on friday if you remember
[35:07] i put some emphasis just for a
[35:09] foundation for this morning and this
[35:12] afternoon's message of the location
[35:16] no man was worthy is that right
[35:18] what does the bible say let's go to
[35:20] revelations 5
[35:22] that way
[35:24] i can paraphrase it
[35:25] but let's read it the way it is
[35:28] it'll become important here in just a
[35:30] second
[35:32] revelations 5 1 it says and i saw on the
[35:34] right hand what does right hand mean
[35:38] a position a particular position of
[35:41] power all right and i also want you to
[35:45] know that it also
[35:47] means confidence
[35:49] you see if you have a right hand man you
[35:52] have one in the world we live in because
[35:54] you can put confidence in that man and
[35:57] you believe that whatever needs to be
[35:59] done that man or that woman ever how you
[36:01] want to put it that person is going to
[36:04] get the job done
[36:06] that's why they've become the right hand
[36:09] man and they've been given the authority
[36:11] to to carry out the job
[36:18] now i saw in the right hand
[36:21] brother ram says god don't have a right
[36:23] hand like you're thinking
[36:26] of him that sat on the throne a book
[36:29] written within and on the back side
[36:31] sealed with seven seals a straw i saw a
[36:33] strong angel proclaim with a loud voice
[36:35] who's worthy to open the book loose the
[36:37] seals thereof no man in heaven nor in
[36:39] earth neither under the earth so i'm
[36:41] going to stop right there location
[36:44] because there is a man worthy
[36:49] he's just not located in these three
[36:52] places
[36:55] okay
[36:56] because you see john without the
[36:59] revelation that you and i have heard the
[37:02] same thing that we just read and he said
[37:05] oh no
[37:08] no man's worthy
[37:10] but john didn't have the revelation
[37:13] delivered to him that you and i have to
[37:16] pay attention to the location because we
[37:18] found out there was
[37:21] and there is
[37:22] and there always will be a man that's
[37:26] worthy but that man that's worthy
[37:29] came in the form of a lamb
[37:33] unassuming
[37:35] gentle
[37:36] meek
[37:38] nearly
[37:39] powerless
[37:41] to the natural eye
[37:45] but nobody
[37:48] can stop a lamb
[37:50] from producing wool
[37:53] oh they might shave it off every time it
[37:55] gets a half inch long but they can't
[37:57] stop that lamb you see so we look at
[38:00] this meek and this gentle and this
[38:03] awkward and this uh unassuming and and
[38:06] and and vulnerable
[38:08] creature
[38:13] that's not a man
[38:17] see see how we define things
[38:23] but this was
[38:25] the man
[38:27] behold
[38:29] the man
[38:31] but he came in such a way
[38:34] where people stumbled over him
[38:38] they missed the whole point of him being
[38:40] here and what he was doing oh when he
[38:43] was breaking the fishes and the loaves
[38:45] buddy they were lining up at the buffet
[38:48] table
[38:49] coming back for more and there was
[38:51] plenty left over
[38:53] so everybody was contently fed
[38:56] physically
[38:59] then he began
[39:02] to be used by god
[39:04] who was in him
[39:08] to heal the sick
[39:11] now he spoke to the people all along the
[39:14] way
[39:16] they didn't realize that his words
[39:19] were the words that brought everything
[39:22] into existence
[39:27] they had creative power
[39:32] they were only bound
[39:36] by the ears
[39:39] of the here
[39:42] so here paul talking about a body
[39:46] don't worry i'm going to launch into the
[39:48] message
[39:49] i'm just warming up
[39:52] i'm asking the lord to help
[39:54] move me around
[39:56] now i'm gonna do something that i've
[39:58] done here before and i do it all the
[39:59] time at home i feel comfortable i feel
[40:02] like i'm at home so i feel like i can do
[40:04] it here
[40:05] are you okay with that
[40:08] i'm gonna i'm i don't need to read the
[40:10] whole thing even though i love to read
[40:12] it because it makes perfect sense to me
[40:15] but there is a portion of
[40:19] she already had it ready
[40:21] of a statement that brother branham
[40:23] makes and i i know i've read it to you
[40:25] i'm going to emphasize it i want you to
[40:27] get it
[40:30] i think i heard brother black speak
[40:32] about book and names and so forth
[40:37] in the revelation of jesus christ 12 4
[40:40] 60
[40:44] and the book of revelation has more
[40:46] symbols in it
[40:49] and you know why i read this over and
[40:50] over
[40:53] because of the age we live in
[40:55] this this paragraph here wouldn't make
[40:57] hardly any sense to anybody else
[41:00] but it's the day we live in
[41:03] it's the age we live in
[41:05] it's the time we live in
[41:09] so we're being given something
[41:12] now this statement that i'm going to
[41:14] read to you could have been
[41:16] in the mind of god before the foundation
[41:18] of the world but until
[41:21] god deemed it this statement that was in
[41:24] his mind to be purposeful
[41:28] it wouldn't have made that much
[41:30] difference
[41:33] but the release of the thoughts of god
[41:38] in their due time
[41:41] is the difference maker and then those
[41:44] who were put there by god to receive
[41:48] those statements
[41:51] makes all the difference in the world
[41:54] brothers and sisters
[41:58] the book of revelation has more symbols
[42:00] in it what's a symbol
[42:02] a symbol
[42:04] is a token of identity
[42:07] verified by comparing its other half
[42:15] so the word symbol requires two parts
[42:19] an a team
[42:21] and a b team
[42:24] i don't mind being second string
[42:28] i really don't mind at all to the
[42:30] sadducees and pharisees and the
[42:31] religious figures and the political
[42:33] leaders of the day jesus was
[42:36] down at the end of the bench
[42:40] and he was god
[42:44] the book of revelation has more symbols
[42:45] in it than all the rest of the books in
[42:47] the bible it has more symbols because it
[42:49] is a book of prophecy that means it's a
[42:51] book that was written for the future
[42:55] now god delivered these this information
[42:59] to john the revelator to saint john on
[43:03] the alapatmos 2000 years ago
[43:07] or so right
[43:11] but at some point brothers and sisters
[43:13] prophecy
[43:16] has to come to pass
[43:18] because it was meant for the future
[43:24] i know this sounds crazy
[43:26] but hollywood gets its inspiration
[43:32] from the creator
[43:36] so we're going back to the future
[43:42] that's real that's reality
[43:44] it's not a movie
[43:46] with a crazy doctor
[43:49] and a car that never worked good
[43:51] it's not
[43:53] they grab that inspiration and and all
[43:56] that
[43:57] hollywood displays all that the film
[44:00] industry displays
[44:03] they got that inspiration
[44:05] you say well they got it from the devil
[44:07] where'd he get it from
[44:08] he's not a creator
[44:10] he had to fetch it from somewhere
[44:15] now i'm gonna ask you a personal
[44:16] question which i ask myself all the time
[44:18] where do you get your inspiration from
[44:27] many times we have to say lord i'm sorry
[44:32] i didn't mean to think that
[44:34] that's not me
[44:36] after a while you you you begin to
[44:39] understand that the thoughts that come
[44:41] to you that start to attack you wherever
[44:44] you're weak or your weaknesses are it's
[44:46] not you
[44:47] and you keep telling them thoughts
[44:49] that's not me
[44:51] that's not me
[44:52] but you've got to mean it and then at
[44:55] some point
[44:57] the overcoming of those thoughts
[44:59] requires
[45:00] not just a statement that's not me
[45:05] requires boldness
[45:07] it requires you the inside man or woman
[45:10] to stand up and say okay i'm ready to
[45:12] fight now because that's not me
[45:16] come on devil i'll take you on what do
[45:18] you mean come on devil
[45:21] you're your own worst enemy i'm my own
[45:23] worst you're not my enemy
[45:27] i'm my own worst enemy
[45:29] i i i see the conflict
[45:33] between god and satan but god has made a
[45:35] way god has has has his own
[45:39] pharmacy
[45:43] my wife uses the term big pharma because
[45:45] it's on the
[45:48] but
[45:50] you understand that's
[45:51] part of the control
[45:55] and you say well wait a minute god's
[45:57] controlling but the way he goes about it
[46:00] is not forced
[46:04] god has afforded you and i the
[46:06] opportunity to be able to look into him
[46:11] into him
[46:13] because he and his word are one
[46:16] in the beginning was the word see now it
[46:19] begins should begin to make sense
[46:22] and the word was with god and the word
[46:24] was god and then here's the key this is
[46:27] the part that the devil don't want to
[46:30] happen the word was made flesh and dwelt
[46:34] among us
[46:35] but once it's made flesh now he has an
[46:38] object an entity a tangible thing that
[46:41] he can try to manipulate
[46:44] that's where you and i come in
[46:46] to him
[46:48] that overcometh amen
[46:52] you're looking at an overcomer
[46:54] and i'm looking at overcomers
[46:57] but guess what
[46:59] we're one body
[47:02] that's why we're not overcoming each
[47:04] other
[47:06] but god knows what he's doing
[47:08] he's put all kinds of people in your way
[47:11] no not so you can overcome them
[47:14] so you can overcome yourself
[47:17] [Laughter]
[47:19] they have their own
[47:20] overcoming to do the bible says they
[47:23] have to work out their own salvation
[47:25] with fear and trembling study thine own
[47:27] self to be approved
[47:29] that doesn't mean you become a
[47:30] theologian necessarily
[47:33] god has to place
[47:35] a person
[47:37] you say well
[47:39] i'm insignificant
[47:41] the janitor is especially in the day we
[47:44] live in
[47:45] is not insignificant
[47:48] they're busy wiping everything down and
[47:50] you know disinfecting everything
[47:54] they seemed insignificant a few years
[47:56] ago but they're not now
[48:00] king david said i'd rather be the
[48:02] gatekeeper
[48:04] than to sit in the seats of the ungodly
[48:08] lord
[48:09] god's prophet to us
[48:11] even revealed it better
[48:15] i'd like to be the doormat
[48:19] you say ain't no way
[48:22] you're there
[48:24] if you're the doormat you're there
[48:26] and guess what
[48:28] he's no respecter of persons
[48:32] remember when jesus went
[48:35] just
[48:36] and any any and brother branham preached
[48:38] about simon and how they didn't wash his
[48:40] feet and then the woman showed up and
[48:42] washed his feet with their alabaster box
[48:44] and her tears and dried it with her hair
[48:48] and brother brandon preached message
[48:50] foot wash flunky
[48:52] who was the foot wash flunky
[48:55] jesus
[48:58] he was the one who inspired her
[49:00] to do what she did
[49:02] so brothers and sisters
[49:05] don't look down upon somebody who
[49:07] doesn't have the stature
[49:09] or the importance
[49:11] or the finance
[49:13] you understand or the position in this
[49:16] material world
[49:19] it's harder for a rich man
[49:22] to go to heaven oh then nobody's going
[49:24] to be saved i didn't say that
[49:27] all things are possible with god
[49:32] all right
[49:33] but don't make it too hard on yourself
[49:36] let me continue to read it's a prophetic
[49:38] book therefore it has to be understood
[49:43] did you realize it's going to be
[49:44] understood
[49:46] now i think i heard the brother reading
[49:48] out of proverbs
[49:50] and just this last week i saw a little
[49:53] uh plaque
[49:55] that
[49:56] said understanding is better than
[49:59] knowledge
[50:05] it said
[50:06] you may know me
[50:09] but do you understand me
[50:12] so in that case
[50:15] that's why
[50:16] i repeated to you what brother branham
[50:18] said about a man putting upon him you
[50:21] don't know your bible
[50:22] what that man was saying is you don't
[50:24] have no knowledge and when brother
[50:26] branham answered him back i may not but
[50:28] i know the author real well brother
[50:30] branham was stating but i've got
[50:31] understanding
[50:34] see i know the person who wrote the book
[50:37] and that's the most important person to
[50:40] know it's the only reason you and i
[50:44] brothers and sisters can come to any
[50:46] understanding of the book of revelation
[50:48] which is a book of prophecy which is the
[50:50] for the future
[50:54] because it's a prophetic book
[50:57] and it has to be understood by a
[50:59] prophetic class
[51:02] so don't fret
[51:08] i don't understand it
[51:10] i'm gonna i'm gonna be blunt you mean
[51:12] you don't believe it
[51:17] because once you begin to really believe
[51:23] in something for which there is no proof
[51:27] i want you to think about
[51:29] the greatest inventions of all time
[51:35] the inventors of the things that you and
[51:38] i take
[51:39] for granted so casually
[51:42] most of them had a vision it wasn't a
[51:44] vision like
[51:45] god showing them a vision like they were
[51:47] prophets but they saw something that
[51:50] could be done
[51:52] that could work better
[51:54] that could
[51:56] propel
[51:58] could help
[52:00] or could save
[52:03] and they began to work on that vision
[52:07] to them it was prophetic
[52:10] to them
[52:12] it wasn't listen careful the future
[52:16] it was the present
[52:19] but they hadn't attained yet
[52:23] that which they were trying to perform
[52:29] paul even mentions that what i would do
[52:31] good
[52:32] the evils always when i when i would
[52:34] that i could not and i wouldn't
[52:37] you understand paul knew
[52:39] paul knew that there was a future
[52:45] but there's not a thing you can do about
[52:47] it
[52:48] you must live in the present
[52:50] but brothers and sisters you and i have
[52:52] come to a point
[52:53] in time
[52:55] where the present
[52:57] is
[52:58] that future
[53:04] you say you mean the future of humanity
[53:06] the future of the world the future of
[53:08] freedom the future no
[53:13] the future
[53:15] of the body
[53:17] of christ
[53:19] that's how important you are
[53:22] you may feel insignificant and you may
[53:25] think you're not getting it but god has
[53:27] placed you in the age
[53:29] where you are of the utmost
[53:33] importance
[53:36] it just hasn't been revealed to you yet
[53:40] what your job is
[53:45] i'm going to tell you what it is
[53:47] it's to be a prophetic class
[53:51] it's not a job like a title and a name
[53:53] tag and a position
[53:55] that pays a salary
[53:57] this is without money and without price
[54:00] here's what you get out of this deal
[54:03] eternal life
[54:06] no pain no suffering
[54:08] you don't have to worry about your
[54:09] subconscious battling with your
[54:11] conscience you don't have to worry about
[54:13] your mind warring with itself
[54:16] or with me
[54:20] it's a prophetic book therefore it has
[54:22] to be understood by a prophetic class
[54:23] the book is not meant for everybody
[54:28] that's not politically correct
[54:33] but i'm going to tell you that it's been
[54:34] offered to everybody
[54:36] the opportunity has been offered to
[54:38] every man woman and child
[54:41] there's nobody can understand it hardly
[54:44] this book is made for a certain class of
[54:47] people
[54:48] the carnal mind cannot understand them
[54:51] great things of the scripture because
[54:53] it's foolish to them
[54:56] but the ones who are lovers of the word
[54:59] of god that's who the book was written
[55:01] to
[55:03] to the church
[55:05] right
[55:06] okay and i'm going to start moving are
[55:07] you still with me
[55:09] i didn't get up here to bore you to
[55:11] death that's for sure
[55:12] now i'm going to read to you
[55:15] out of
[55:17] the first seal
[55:21] page 110
[55:25] i know the brother might be able to get
[55:27] that up there
[55:29] now i'm going to start with
[55:31] on 110 brother paragraph 43 now the
[55:35] seven seal rolled book is now being
[55:38] released by the lamb
[55:41] is now being released by the lamb
[55:44] remember this book was kept sealed
[55:48] and a seal is to protect
[55:51] a seal is to keep something
[55:54] bound
[55:56] under lock and key
[55:58] so that
[55:59] unauthorized hands and eyes and ears
[56:03] cannot
[56:05] manipulate it
[56:09] he says now we believe that or let me
[56:12] being released by the lamb we approach
[56:14] that place tonight god help us as the
[56:15] seals are broken and released the
[56:17] mysteries of the book are revealed
[56:21] we're going to find out what this book
[56:22] is here in a minute this this
[56:25] prophetic book this book of symbols
[56:28] he says now you see this is a sealed
[56:30] book
[56:31] now we believe that do we not
[56:33] congregation says amen we believe that
[56:35] it is a sealed book now we never knowed
[56:37] this before but it's sealed with seven
[56:40] seals that is on the back of the book
[56:42] the book is sealed with seven seals
[56:45] he if he was talking watch i'm gonna
[56:47] hold this up about this kind of book
[56:50] it would be like putting strap across it
[56:53] seven straps
[56:55] but it isn't
[56:57] this kind of book
[57:00] why
[57:02] says it is
[57:03] we read in revelations that it uses the
[57:06] word be double okay but it's symbols
[57:12] this object that i have in my hand
[57:15] stands for
[57:16] or represents something other than
[57:19] itself
[57:21] that's the definition
[57:23] and in order to be able to come to an
[57:26] understanding of the true
[57:29] meaning of the symbol
[57:32] another half
[57:35] is required oh not another half of the
[57:38] book but the reality of the definition
[57:44] this is a symbol
[57:46] it says book
[57:48] where did they get the idea for that
[57:51] well of course me i just go to the
[57:53] dictionary
[57:56] now
[57:57] this is what we think
[58:00] when we hear the word book
[58:03] a set of written sheets or paper
[58:08] a set of written printed or blank sheets
[58:12] bound together in a volume
[58:17] watch now watch as we move into the
[58:19] definition of the word book and where
[58:22] this symbol this object that you and i
[58:26] call a book found its roots
[58:30] because if we could find the root
[58:35] of what this symbol is
[58:38] we will have the other half
[58:41] and then it will be fully defined
[58:44] it won't be just a symbol anymore it'll
[58:47] still be called a book and it may still
[58:49] look like one but we'll know its intent
[58:53] right right right
[58:56] we'll know why it's called a book
[58:59] and you may not think it's important
[59:02] but it will be because it's a book of
[59:05] prophecy
[59:08] prophecy is the future
[59:12] but what happens
[59:14] to to us creatures of time is you and i
[59:17] can't see the future
[59:19] we don't really know what tomorrow holds
[59:22] but we should have confidence in who
[59:24] holds tomorrow
[59:30] and it ain't the governments
[59:32] and it ain't the churches
[59:35] and it ain't science
[59:37] they change their mind every five
[59:39] minutes
[59:40] that's their business
[59:42] amen
[59:43] we need to put our confidence
[59:47] in an unmoving
[59:49] unchangeable
[59:51] unalterable
[59:54] object
[59:56] of worship amen
[59:58] god
[1:00:00] himself
[1:00:02] so we find as we begin to look into the
[1:00:06] meaning
[1:00:08] of the symbol
[1:00:12] and we get a little deeper into the
[1:00:14] definition it says something that yields
[1:00:17] knowledge or understanding
[1:00:21] that's what books were written for
[1:00:24] now some of them could be fairy tales
[1:00:27] some of them could be
[1:00:29] just just figments of the imagination of
[1:00:32] the writer some of them could be science
[1:00:34] fiction as we call it
[1:00:39] but even in that the writer's intent
[1:00:42] the author of that work
[1:00:46] put down
[1:00:49] in this form
[1:00:53] what they wanted to convey from
[1:00:56] themselves
[1:00:57] is that right
[1:00:59] in other words
[1:01:00] let me give you a better definition for
[1:01:02] it it becomes an attribute
[1:01:07] it becomes listen now a child
[1:01:11] of theirs
[1:01:13] and a good author has lots of children
[1:01:20] the best author
[1:01:23] has lots of children right that's right
[1:01:26] but only one body
[1:01:29] only one source
[1:01:31] just like the author
[1:01:34] of a series
[1:01:35] of books that they turn into theatrical
[1:01:38] and everybody spends all kinds of money
[1:01:42] and then they allow
[1:01:44] because your eyes
[1:01:46] are the gate
[1:01:48] to your soul they allow that information
[1:01:52] to be disseminated into themselves
[1:01:54] through their eyes
[1:01:57] and look at the world we live in
[1:02:00] it's mad
[1:02:01] it's crazy
[1:02:03] it's falling apart
[1:02:05] brothers and sisters there's only one
[1:02:07] hope for this world
[1:02:09] only one
[1:02:11] it's got to be cleaned off
[1:02:14] that's not our responsibility
[1:02:17] our responsibility is to fulfill
[1:02:20] god's
[1:02:21] word
[1:02:23] and by fulfilling god's word
[1:02:25] he's made a way of
[1:02:27] escape
[1:02:30] now if you're trying to escape
[1:02:34] the destruction of the earth you may
[1:02:36] have the wrong motive and objective
[1:02:38] [Laughter]
[1:02:40] you might find yourself in the room and
[1:02:42] the bible says how do you get in here
[1:02:46] you don't have the appropriate garment
[1:02:48] on
[1:02:49] [Music]
[1:02:51] you're not wearing
[1:02:53] that portion of covering
[1:02:56] that i ordained for those who find
[1:03:00] safety in this place
[1:03:04] take him
[1:03:05] bind him
[1:03:07] cast them into outer darkness and there
[1:03:09] would be weeping and wailing and
[1:03:10] gnashing of teeth why because that
[1:03:11] person fought
[1:03:15] they were in
[1:03:18] and do you know what the mistake was
[1:03:20] that they made
[1:03:22] they thought
[1:03:27] right because his understanding is not
[1:03:29] ours his thoughts are higher than our
[1:03:31] thoughts
[1:03:32] his thoughts are not so we have to come
[1:03:35] clean we have to empty out
[1:03:38] we have to find ourselves to a place
[1:03:41] where we realize that we're a wretched
[1:03:45] sinful
[1:03:46] character now sin is unbelief it doesn't
[1:03:48] mean you have to be an alcoholic or a
[1:03:50] drug addict or a most of the time
[1:03:53] as i was before i got saved you get to a
[1:03:56] very low point you've tried all of the
[1:04:00] of the things that the world has to
[1:04:02] offer in the form of of drugs and so
[1:04:04] forth and music and whatever and you
[1:04:06] find yourself slipping into a darker and
[1:04:08] darker and darker less light and less
[1:04:10] light and less light but you think
[1:04:12] you're happy
[1:04:16] you're not happy
[1:04:18] i can tell by the look on your face
[1:04:22] and you won't let me look into your eyes
[1:04:27] i've been there
[1:04:30] i was born in sin shaped and iniquity
[1:04:31] coming to the world speaking lies full
[1:04:33] of trouble and shortage age just like
[1:04:34] everybody else
[1:04:38] but let me keep going we'll be here all
[1:04:41] day amen
[1:04:43] because god's word is wonderful
[1:04:45] and and like i said you all know me in
[1:04:48] the beginning i'm a pretty short-winded
[1:04:49] fella
[1:04:50] but god's word has made a change in my
[1:04:52] life so in such a dramatic way that
[1:04:55] i can't stop
[1:04:58] loving his word
[1:05:02] but i
[1:05:03] thank you
[1:05:05] listen now as we get closer to the other
[1:05:08] half of what this symbol is
[1:05:12] and i just got this out of the
[1:05:13] dictionary you can go buy the dictionary
[1:05:15] that i'm using it's not special
[1:05:22] let's go a little further inside
[1:05:24] information or analysis oh now we're
[1:05:27] getting a little intellectual a little
[1:05:29] scientific
[1:05:36] also
[1:05:37] uh dictionary
[1:05:38] not me
[1:05:39] but i can see now why god allowed the
[1:05:43] terminology that is in this bible to be
[1:05:47] put in there in the form of words
[1:05:51] not by mistake
[1:05:52] not happenstance
[1:05:54] not carelessly but he put them in there
[1:05:57] so that at some point in time
[1:06:00] there would be a group of people which i
[1:06:02] believe we constitute a portion of that
[1:06:04] body who would be interested enough and
[1:06:06] going well
[1:06:08] gee all the denominations use the same
[1:06:11] book
[1:06:13] oh christianity uses the same book what
[1:06:16] makes us different
[1:06:18] i'll tell you what makes us different is
[1:06:20] because god has put something in you
[1:06:24] that transcends
[1:06:26] the symbol
[1:06:30] i see it's a book i can read it's a book
[1:06:33] but we found out that the right hand
[1:06:35] isn't a hand
[1:06:37] that's right
[1:06:38] it's an exact and specific position of
[1:06:41] authority and confidence
[1:06:45] wouldn't you love
[1:06:47] wouldn't you love to have god's book
[1:06:51] in your right hand amen
[1:06:54] that means he puts confidence in you
[1:06:55] brother that means he's given you all
[1:06:59] recognition of authority to know what to
[1:07:01] do with it
[1:07:02] how to handle it
[1:07:06] and notice as long as it's located in
[1:07:09] his right hand it's sealed
[1:07:14] because i can't give you this i can
[1:07:16] preach until the cows come home and i
[1:07:19] can't give you revelation
[1:07:21] flesh and blood didn't reveal this to
[1:07:23] you peter but my father which is in
[1:07:25] heaven revealed it to you and on that
[1:07:27] rock
[1:07:28] i'm going to build my church
[1:07:31] and the gates of hell will come against
[1:07:32] them but they will not they cannot
[1:07:35] prevail
[1:07:37] and they've come against
[1:07:39] they're coming against
[1:07:41] some of us are standing with them wide
[1:07:43] open going which way should i go
[1:07:45] well we read about lot
[1:07:49] you choose
[1:07:51] you'll choose which direction you'll go
[1:07:53] in you do not have to go through those
[1:07:55] gates
[1:07:58] because you'll have to fight your way
[1:08:00] out
[1:08:01] brother bram says we fight our way to
[1:08:02] hell
[1:08:05] it's a free gift
[1:08:07] the message of the hour you want to talk
[1:08:10] about brothers and sisters are you
[1:08:11] hearing me this is the most intricate
[1:08:16] the most interesting
[1:08:20] the most hidden
[1:08:26] work of literature there is
[1:08:29] no bro that's just the bible my mom and
[1:08:31] dad have had that laying in the house
[1:08:33] since i was born
[1:08:36] but now
[1:08:37] we've come to the point in time where
[1:08:39] god
[1:08:41] has decided to open up
[1:08:44] that bible
[1:08:46] you know that one that's been laying
[1:08:48] around there for decades and for eons
[1:08:50] and for centuries
[1:08:55] that's why god sent a prophet
[1:08:57] not so we could worship him
[1:08:59] not so we could quote his name
[1:09:01] not when you hear me reading out of
[1:09:03] these messages i believe this is god's
[1:09:05] word
[1:09:06] given to a man and and and if we don't
[1:09:09] believe that we're all
[1:09:12] sorry creatures
[1:09:13] if you don't believe the man behind the
[1:09:16] pulpit
[1:09:17] is an instrument that god is using to
[1:09:20] take what he's revealed and then
[1:09:24] put it together
[1:09:27] and make bread
[1:09:30] squeeze it
[1:09:33] it's the fruit of the vine
[1:09:36] you're wasting your time
[1:09:39] i'm wasting my time
[1:09:42] we're no better than the prophet called
[1:09:44] us a lodge
[1:09:46] a group of people that gather together
[1:09:49] under an inspiration for similar ideas
[1:09:55] this better not be a lodge
[1:09:58] because i'm no lodge member
[1:10:10] that's the only thing
[1:10:12] that will matter
[1:10:13] it's the only thing that will save us
[1:10:17] it's god's way of escape
[1:10:24] but he's been holding it back
[1:10:28] until a point
[1:10:29] in time where there's a group of people
[1:10:32] that are prepared to receive it
[1:10:35] you have to be ready
[1:10:37] you have to be willing
[1:10:39] you have to be able or it's just going
[1:10:41] to be a few hours of boring time and
[1:10:45] it's too hot in here and i'm sleepy and
[1:10:46] i'm hungry
[1:10:51] but according to the
[1:10:53] prophet's words
[1:10:55] when the revelation of jesus christ
[1:10:57] really takes a hold of you and you
[1:11:00] surrender yourself to it he said you
[1:11:03] can't wait
[1:11:05] till those doors are open because you're
[1:11:07] not coming here to hear the man and see
[1:11:10] the woman you're coming here because
[1:11:12] you're being fed
[1:11:14] from the soul
[1:11:17] something in you is crying out and
[1:11:19] craving
[1:11:21] now you don't know exactly what it is
[1:11:23] but he does so he's prepared
[1:11:27] that's right
[1:11:28] amen
[1:11:30] the right inoculation
[1:11:33] for that problem
[1:11:36] listen now
[1:11:38] the word book
[1:11:41] oh i'm just getting started
[1:11:44] the word book now remember this
[1:11:47] is in the hands
[1:11:49] of the creator
[1:11:52] i could read it to you but i'll
[1:11:54] paraphrase it when adam forfeited his
[1:11:56] rights to this book
[1:11:58] it could not fall into the hands of the
[1:12:01] devil satan himself lucifer why because
[1:12:04] it wasn't his right
[1:12:09] i'm going to tell you right now that the
[1:12:10] book that i'm speaking to you about
[1:12:12] lucifer's name's not in it
[1:12:14] oh his name's in this book
[1:12:18] but this is a symbol
[1:12:21] this is something that stands for or
[1:12:23] represents
[1:12:25] something else
[1:12:28] see you even have to have a revelation
[1:12:30] of who the devil is
[1:12:32] and he's obvious
[1:12:34] but some people i'd rather worship satan
[1:12:36] they say
[1:12:37] go for it
[1:12:38] it's in the book
[1:12:40] it says
[1:12:41] there will be people that will do that
[1:12:45] he was such a good preacher
[1:12:51] but he deceived angels
[1:12:53] that's right
[1:12:55] and he deceived those angels in such a
[1:12:57] way where the book of jude tells us they
[1:12:58] left their first estate god had given
[1:13:00] them
[1:13:02] property had given them rights
[1:13:07] god had given them the opportunity which
[1:13:09] is presented to you this morning to have
[1:13:11] a place in his kingdom
[1:13:15] and they rejected it
[1:13:17] because of some fancy pants preacher
[1:13:23] remember this is a book of prophecy
[1:13:25] forget your past
[1:13:28] i don't care how you've been put upon
[1:13:31] i don't care who's marred your life
[1:13:33] it's a book of prophecy
[1:13:35] it's for the future and it's for your
[1:13:38] future
[1:13:39] and your future could be today you don't
[1:13:42] know that you're not gonna be here
[1:13:44] tomorrow
[1:13:46] so today is the day of salvation
[1:13:52] listen to this
[1:13:55] but when we get down when we start
[1:13:56] boiling down
[1:13:58] the meaning of the symbol
[1:14:00] it gets down to something very simple
[1:14:03] it was
[1:14:05] god its root
[1:14:07] of the meanings that i read to you out
[1:14:10] of one word
[1:14:13] manifest
[1:14:16] i did make it up i just got out of the
[1:14:18] picture
[1:14:22] what is the whole world
[1:14:24] groaning
[1:14:26] and waiting
[1:14:28] paul says in romans
[1:14:30] it's the manifestation
[1:14:34] so what manifestation is
[1:14:36] is it's the life of the manifest
[1:14:40] and the word manifest finds its roots
[1:14:45] where's the book at
[1:14:49] mano
[1:14:51] hand
[1:14:54] do you see the connection do you see the
[1:14:57] symbol
[1:14:59] the hand
[1:15:02] has put names
[1:15:08] in something that it's willing to
[1:15:10] protect
[1:15:11] right amen
[1:15:12] sealed it up
[1:15:14] the devil can't get to it
[1:15:16] well neither can you and i
[1:15:20] as long as it's sealed
[1:15:22] no man
[1:15:24] on
[1:15:26] in
[1:15:31] but god has made a way amen
[1:15:34] that's right
[1:15:36] it's a secret
[1:15:40] it's a secret
[1:15:43] and a secret becomes a mystery
[1:15:46] what's that mean
[1:15:47] i can't tell
[1:15:50] you do you mean you can't tell me you
[1:15:53] mean you ain't got facebook
[1:15:55] can't tell you
[1:15:59] have to keep it to myself
[1:16:02] it's the very reason why when jesus
[1:16:03] would do a work that seemed like a
[1:16:05] mighty work let's take the woman at the
[1:16:07] well forgive me for taking so much time
[1:16:09] i'm just
[1:16:12] i want this to get to you even if i only
[1:16:14] get a sentence
[1:16:17] the woman at the well think of her life
[1:16:21] she had five husbands
[1:16:24] i know churches wouldn't let her in the
[1:16:25] door
[1:16:28] her skirt's not long enough
[1:16:31] her hair's chopped she got makeup on
[1:16:34] she'd be married five times
[1:16:36] that's just the one he came for
[1:16:41] he didn't come
[1:16:43] to save the righteous excuse
[1:16:46] me come for the likes of you and me and
[1:16:49] if you think you're righteous you've got
[1:16:50] self-righteousness and there's only one
[1:16:52] thing worse than self-righteousness it's
[1:16:54] self-humility
[1:16:57] oh i'm humble yeah i've seen you humble
[1:17:01] you know what i mean
[1:17:02] and humble doesn't mean you're you're
[1:17:04] just a something that
[1:17:06] the devil can kick around
[1:17:10] but when humanity wants to kick you
[1:17:11] around what do you do here
[1:17:13] go ahead
[1:17:14] here go ahead
[1:17:15] i'm not talking about defending your
[1:17:16] family
[1:17:19] if somebody's coming after your family
[1:17:21] you're going to give your life for them
[1:17:22] just like
[1:17:23] jesus
[1:17:25] the devil was coming after his family he
[1:17:27] said i got this
[1:17:28] i know exactly how to fix this problem
[1:17:31] amen i'll stand in the line of fire sin
[1:17:34] i'll hang on the cross and i'll reverse
[1:17:36] the effects
[1:17:39] of unbelief but somebody has to accept
[1:17:41] it
[1:17:42] he paid the price brother branham told
[1:17:44] us in the seals but he never
[1:17:46] claimed
[1:17:47] the possession
[1:17:48] i'll save that for this afternoon amen
[1:17:52] but you see where we're at
[1:17:54] brothers and sisters
[1:17:56] this is all about location amen
[1:18:01] where are you job
[1:18:04] who's not going to be deceived
[1:18:06] come on
[1:18:07] those whose names
[1:18:10] are written in a book amen
[1:18:13] oh man
[1:18:14] i'll take a little bit more time to
[1:18:16] break down a few more things amen amen
[1:18:19] because brothers and sisters this is not
[1:18:21] a science class
[1:18:23] this is not a literature class
[1:18:26] i'm no sunday school teacher
[1:18:29] but god is revealed through the message
[1:18:31] of the age
[1:18:33] what the other half of this is
[1:18:44] where were you
[1:18:46] how about your names
[1:18:48] they had to be located
[1:18:51] in the lamb's book of life says before
[1:18:54] the foundation of the world and where is
[1:18:56] that book it's not a book it's a
[1:18:59] manifest
[1:19:00] i want you to get that this is a symbol
[1:19:04] you know this is a symbol in so much i
[1:19:06] think you'll get this this is a symbol
[1:19:08] in so much
[1:19:11] that this is only a living word
[1:19:14] if it's in you
[1:19:16] you understand
[1:19:17] so once this is in you you no longer
[1:19:21] need the object
[1:19:22] you no longer need the symbol
[1:19:25] you are it
[1:19:28] you become it
[1:19:30] that's why they crucified the lord come
[1:19:32] on you being a man we don't crucify you
[1:19:35] for your good works we're crucifying you
[1:19:38] because you being a man
[1:19:41] are trying to imitate our book
[1:19:44] no i am the book i am the bread he said
[1:19:47] i am the wine i'm the i'm the manner i'm
[1:19:51] the truth on the line on the way and
[1:19:53] they go
[1:19:53] [Applause]
[1:19:55] no
[1:19:56] we read it in the book that's not the
[1:19:58] book we're talking about
[1:20:00] amen
[1:20:01] if you'll notice this book in
[1:20:03] revelations 5 is in the hand
[1:20:06] of the original owner in his right hand
[1:20:09] but when we get to revelations 10 and
[1:20:11] this book is open it shrinks
[1:20:16] it says and a little book was open
[1:20:19] what happened all the other stuff
[1:20:22] [Music]
[1:20:24] lucifer's name's not in it
[1:20:26] so that's out
[1:20:28] this is not in it that's out
[1:20:30] this is like brother branham said a man
[1:20:32] came to him one day and said we speak
[1:20:34] where the bible speaks
[1:20:35] we're silent with the bible
[1:20:37] silent brother brad said really
[1:20:39] ah judas hung himself will you do the
[1:20:41] same yeah
[1:20:42] oh
[1:20:44] what a what a simple but sublime
[1:20:46] statement
[1:20:48] you're going to do everything the bible
[1:20:49] says
[1:20:51] throw yourself off that cliff
[1:20:55] but it's also written
[1:20:58] the only way you'd know that is if the
[1:21:00] book was in you amen and you knew the
[1:21:03] author
[1:21:04] and how to apply
[1:21:06] what's in it
[1:21:08] that's what's happening
[1:21:10] we don't realize it but we're getting
[1:21:12] the full application
[1:21:15] of the thoughts hebrews 4 12 an intense
[1:21:19] amen
[1:21:21] you say yeah brother but it hurts of
[1:21:23] course it hurts it's a two-edged sword
[1:21:27] but god's two-edged sword cuts while
[1:21:29] it's going in and heals well it's coming
[1:21:30] out
[1:21:32] and and and you say well i got a scar
[1:21:34] praise the lord
[1:21:35] you want that scars for that's for your
[1:21:38] memory
[1:21:39] while you're here and you and you have a
[1:21:42] memory that fights you in a conscience
[1:21:44] and affection and those five gates
[1:21:46] you've got to have something
[1:21:48] that you can look to and go i once was
[1:21:50] lost
[1:21:52] but now i'm found i got a grandson i
[1:21:54] probably told you this was a little boy
[1:21:56] and there was going to be a full eclipse
[1:21:58] and he wanted to go outside and look i
[1:22:00] had a welder's mask so i went out there
[1:22:01] and i looked up and i said wow that's
[1:22:03] really cool he comes outside and he
[1:22:04] looks up and he says man
[1:22:07] i said boy don't you be looking at this
[1:22:09] it was somebody else but he said don't
[1:22:11] you be looking at that son
[1:22:12] that'll blind you
[1:22:14] watch
[1:22:15] a three-year-old
[1:22:18] you think he'd known the author
[1:22:20] he said that's all right daddy
[1:22:22] he said we sing it all the time in
[1:22:24] church
[1:22:25] amazing grace how sweet this sound
[1:22:27] saved a rich like me
[1:22:29] i once was lost but now i'm found i was
[1:22:31] blind but now i see that's what this
[1:22:32] three-year-old kid said
[1:22:36] he didn't understand he was going to be
[1:22:37] blind
[1:22:40] but he wasn't sweating
[1:22:42] because you know he said well he's just
[1:22:44] a little kid
[1:22:46] be his little children
[1:22:48] you see that's we're not supposed to be
[1:22:49] immature
[1:22:51] we're supposed to allow our faith to be
[1:22:54] so simple
[1:22:56] and unobstructed
[1:23:00] that whatever god says
[1:23:02] it's truth this fact will come to pass
[1:23:06] and all i'm doing brothers and sisters
[1:23:08] you may not realize it yet
[1:23:11] but i'm preaching to you
[1:23:13] so that you can come to a conclusion of
[1:23:16] where you're at
[1:23:17] in him
[1:23:20] because it's not just a book
[1:23:23] you see it's that's why they're
[1:23:24] stumbling it's not just a recording
[1:23:29] amen
[1:23:30] there's an intent in there
[1:23:34] that's exactly right brother and you're
[1:23:35] hearing it right now why because every
[1:23:38] man's voice is his word brother branham
[1:23:40] said and if a man is espousing god's
[1:23:44] word and god hath placed him
[1:23:47] he's the voice of god but not the way
[1:23:49] you think
[1:23:50] oh
[1:23:52] god thinks he's
[1:23:54] no that's the whole point if he's a real
[1:23:57] man of god he won't think anything of
[1:23:59] himself
[1:24:00] he'll think he's chiefest of sinners
[1:24:02] that's right and paul already took that
[1:24:04] spot so i'm
[1:24:06] in the tribe
[1:24:08] can't be the chief because paul took it
[1:24:09] and paul said if you preach any other
[1:24:10] gospel than what i preach
[1:24:13] and i say okay paul
[1:24:17] you understand that's there's nothing
[1:24:18] wrong with second string
[1:24:25] i kind of like the bt
[1:24:29] should i keep going
[1:24:31] i've been here a long time i think
[1:24:32] haven't i brother wade
[1:24:34] come on
[1:24:36] oh you give me five ten is that ten okay
[1:24:40] i know i know you're not thank you yeah
[1:24:44] i'm not here to bore you
[1:24:51] i felt led to come here to enlighten you
[1:24:55] we need enlightening
[1:24:57] and i'm only preaching to you those
[1:24:59] things which god has revealed to me in
[1:25:01] simplicity this is not difficult
[1:25:04] because if it was we'd be in trouble
[1:25:06] now some of us are pretty sharp so we
[1:25:07] probably could but see your intellectual
[1:25:09] conceptions will do you no good at the
[1:25:11] end of the run
[1:25:13] because if somebody can talk you into it
[1:25:15] i'm telling you right now devil's got
[1:25:16] somebody to talk out of it
[1:25:18] it's got to become a heartfelt
[1:25:22] soul-saving
[1:25:27] okay i'll go a little further
[1:25:31] i've only made it two paragraphs if he
[1:25:33] was talking about this kind of book it
[1:25:34] would be like putting a strap across
[1:25:36] it's seven straps
[1:25:38] but it isn't this kind of a book
[1:25:41] it's a scroll oh man you brother chris
[1:25:43] you just spent 30 minutes telling us
[1:25:46] that it wasn't a book
[1:25:49] and brother brown says it's a scroll
[1:25:50] well do you know what scroll means
[1:25:56] i'll take a little less time because i
[1:25:57] want to get to something before this
[1:25:59] afternoon
[1:26:02] oh yeah
[1:26:03] i just get the dictionary out
[1:26:06] hang on
[1:26:07] scroll
[1:26:12] this is what we
[1:26:13] see
[1:26:14] when we hear
[1:26:16] scroll
[1:26:27] that's a symbol
[1:26:30] has a much much deeper greater meaning
[1:26:33] than this rolled up piece of paper
[1:26:36] but because it appeared in the form of
[1:26:39] symbols
[1:26:40] in vision to john
[1:26:43] john could only express the words that
[1:26:45] he understood
[1:26:48] it looks like a scroll to me that's
[1:26:50] because god wanted him to see a scroll
[1:26:53] but god doesn't want you and i to see a
[1:26:55] scroll because he's given us something
[1:26:58] that goes beyond this recognition
[1:27:05] a scroll
[1:27:09] from the word roll
[1:27:11] r-o-l-l and then the dictionary says
[1:27:14] see
[1:27:16] the word escrow
[1:27:19] i'll save that for this afternoon
[1:27:23] so then it begins to give us the
[1:27:24] definition
[1:27:26] of what john saw in symbol form he a
[1:27:29] roll of parchment
[1:27:31] paper
[1:27:32] etc usually with writing or pictures on
[1:27:36] it
[1:27:38] the second definition says an ancient
[1:27:40] book
[1:27:43] in the form of a rolled listen to the
[1:27:46] words that's used in the dictionary
[1:27:48] manuscript
[1:27:52] that comes from the word hand
[1:27:54] location location location you know i
[1:27:58] remember when i was a young man ray kroc
[1:28:00] the the guy who started the mcdonald's
[1:28:02] restaurant chain
[1:28:05] said he doesn't open up hamburger joints
[1:28:07] this is in his book
[1:28:10] he says i buy real estate
[1:28:13] wait a minute this is the guy that owns
[1:28:15] the mcdonald's
[1:28:16] restaurant chain
[1:28:18] i don't open up hamburger stands he says
[1:28:21] i buy real estate
[1:28:23] what did he mean
[1:28:26] i'm going to tell you what he meant
[1:28:27] because you can read it in his biography
[1:28:29] or his autobiography
[1:28:30] he said i pick out the very best
[1:28:32] location
[1:28:34] in any town i go to
[1:28:36] i don't care how much that piece of
[1:28:38] property costs i've got a team of guys
[1:28:40] that'll go in there and buy that piece
[1:28:42] of property for what its value is over
[1:28:45] or under inflated
[1:28:47] when walt disney was going to open up
[1:28:49] disney world in florida he had a third
[1:28:52] party agent who
[1:28:54] didn't know who he was
[1:28:56] hired through a middle agent
[1:28:59] to go look for the land because as soon
[1:29:01] as somebody said walt disney's looking
[1:29:03] for land
[1:29:04] the price just tripled brother
[1:29:07] and then everybody around that area
[1:29:09] would triple the price of that
[1:29:12] it makes sense
[1:29:16] location
[1:29:18] this is the where the term came from for
[1:29:20] the real estate industry it came from
[1:29:21] ray kroc
[1:29:23] so well how do you figure it out how do
[1:29:25] you figure out which piece of property
[1:29:27] to put your mcdonald's on he said
[1:29:28] location location location
[1:29:31] i want the best location
[1:29:33] i want the one that's easiest to get in
[1:29:35] out of now that's changed
[1:29:39] even the location mentality changed why
[1:29:41] because he's passed away
[1:29:44] disney world has changed
[1:29:46] disneyland has changed you want to talk
[1:29:48] about a diabolical corrupt
[1:29:51] institution
[1:29:52] because it's not owned by walt disney
[1:29:55] i think it's owned by abc and espn and
[1:29:57] all them other outfits sony
[1:30:00] yeah
[1:30:01] i'm not telling you not to go to
[1:30:02] disneyland
[1:30:03] but i'll tell you when the founder
[1:30:06] of something that he thinks is good for
[1:30:08] the people
[1:30:10] makes a decision
[1:30:12] it usually starts out right
[1:30:16] maybe you don't know this and i'm not
[1:30:18] promoting this i just want you to
[1:30:19] understand the nuances of god's word but
[1:30:22] did you know that william branham the
[1:30:24] prophet of the age
[1:30:26] mentions walt disney
[1:30:29] did you know there's a place where he
[1:30:31] says he's one of us
[1:30:33] do you look it up
[1:30:34] you find it you read it it's in there
[1:30:39] but he calls it walt's place
[1:30:41] [Laughter]
[1:30:44] see brothers and sisters we get we get
[1:30:46] so uptight
[1:30:50] we get so legalistical and
[1:30:52] fundamentalist about things that we
[1:30:54] can't see
[1:30:55] the forest for the trees
[1:31:00] but it's all laid out right here the
[1:31:02] word scroll
[1:31:04] at the end of the day
[1:31:06] looks like a rolled
[1:31:09] manuscript and watch where they got the
[1:31:11] definition from listen now careful a
[1:31:14] list of names
[1:31:16] i didn't make this up it's in the
[1:31:18] dictionary it came from a root word
[1:31:21] why so if you think about it if you
[1:31:23] think about the word scroll came from a
[1:31:27] a an action
[1:31:30] that required a list of names
[1:31:34] oh
[1:31:35] what john saw was deadly accurate
[1:31:41] what he explained he saw was a scroll
[1:31:46] but anybody who understood what the
[1:31:48] scroll represented knew that it wasn't a
[1:31:51] scroll
[1:31:53] literally
[1:31:54] it was a symbol
[1:31:56] what did it stand for
[1:31:58] what's the other half
[1:32:00] of the meaning
[1:32:02] a list
[1:32:03] of names
[1:32:06] makes perfect sense
[1:32:08] it's a book
[1:32:09] it's the lamb's book
[1:32:11] it's got names in it wait until you hear
[1:32:14] what the word name means
[1:32:18] well my name's bill and my name's bob
[1:32:20] and my name's chris and my name's wade
[1:32:22] and my name's
[1:32:23] that's right but that was given to you
[1:32:25] by your earthly parents
[1:32:26] now names have a meaning
[1:32:30] because if the name
[1:32:34] is meant to define the character of the
[1:32:36] person
[1:32:42] don't change your name
[1:32:45] unless it's ricky or elvis
[1:32:47] that's what the prophet said
[1:32:50] because he understood something
[1:32:52] ricky nelson and elvis presley were not
[1:32:55] being put down by god through his
[1:32:58] prophet brother branham was trying to
[1:33:00] express
[1:33:01] something about names
[1:33:04] and then it was revealed that those
[1:33:06] individuals
[1:33:08] became defined or watched now
[1:33:11] their name defined them
[1:33:15] saul to paul
[1:33:19] see what i'm saying
[1:33:21] started changing names in the bible
[1:33:24] why because god wanted there was
[1:33:26] something hidden in that
[1:33:29] in the old testament and in the bible
[1:33:30] it's written and it looks obvious well
[1:33:32] that's because this name meant this and
[1:33:33] this name means this oh now we're
[1:33:36] getting somewhere
[1:33:37] don't worry
[1:33:40] so much about your natural name
[1:33:45] it's the one
[1:33:46] that god put
[1:33:48] in
[1:33:49] that
[1:33:50] book what is my name then brother well
[1:33:52] you'll have to look into the book to see
[1:33:54] and you'll have to reference where
[1:33:56] you're at in the book and then you'll
[1:33:57] have to come to an understanding
[1:34:02] of where you are in that book
[1:34:05] well that's the reason why i feel like a
[1:34:07] big shot
[1:34:11] that's not what your name defines
[1:34:15] let's take jesus
[1:34:17] it was specific
[1:34:18] listen mary
[1:34:20] that which is born of thee
[1:34:23] is of the holy ghost
[1:34:26] and i've given the holy ghost a name
[1:34:29] jesus
[1:34:30] you'll call him
[1:34:32] jesus
[1:34:34] hmm better go see what that name means
[1:34:36] now the angel
[1:34:37] had his own little
[1:34:38] dictionary
[1:34:40] savior
[1:34:43] so that's why jesus could in in
[1:34:46] luke 4
[1:34:47] going to the temple
[1:34:50] priest handed him the book
[1:34:53] he opened the book
[1:34:55] it didn't look like his name
[1:34:57] but he gave the definition of it that's
[1:35:00] right
[1:35:00] in isaiah
[1:35:03] but then he only read watch now
[1:35:06] half
[1:35:06] of verse two and stopped wait a minute
[1:35:10] how come he only read half of verse 2
[1:35:13] he's all the word
[1:35:17] but he knew there was a prophetic class
[1:35:19] that was coming
[1:35:21] he knew john was going to be on the isle
[1:35:23] of patmos and john was going to be
[1:35:25] seeing symbols in the form of a vision
[1:35:27] because john didn't really know what was
[1:35:29] going on
[1:35:32] amen
[1:35:34] and he knew the definition of symbol
[1:35:39] requires another half
[1:35:43] i remember when i first the lord first
[1:35:45] showed this to me you mean the word of
[1:35:47] god and we are always informed to quote
[1:35:51] all the word and to finish every
[1:35:53] sentence and and here is the word
[1:35:56] himself stopping
[1:35:59] in the middle of a sentence
[1:36:01] what did he do that for
[1:36:03] well he did it because of the definition
[1:36:05] symbol
[1:36:10] a token of identity verified by
[1:36:12] comparing its other half
[1:36:14] oh that makes perfect sense to me now
[1:36:16] did you know
[1:36:18] what the other half
[1:36:20] of the sentence and the scripture that
[1:36:22] jesus did not read
[1:36:25] it's the bride
[1:36:28] but it was the day of judgment
[1:36:32] and he wasn't
[1:36:34] here that day you understand 2000 years
[1:36:36] ago was not the day of judgment it was a
[1:36:38] day of salvation
[1:36:40] but when john turned and the elder said
[1:36:43] behold the lion of the tribe of judah
[1:36:46] that elder knew
[1:36:48] judgment
[1:36:50] was fixing to take place
[1:36:54] you and me
[1:36:56] everybody else
[1:36:59] but something happened
[1:37:03] and in the midst
[1:37:04] of the throne
[1:37:06] and of the four beasts
[1:37:10] to the lamb
[1:37:12] he'd been sitting
[1:37:14] you know john couldn't see him the
[1:37:15] prophet said he'd been sitting
[1:37:17] where was he the prophet said back in
[1:37:19] the eternities
[1:37:24] and then he rose
[1:37:26] from the dead
[1:37:28] and stood up and said i've paid the
[1:37:30] price
[1:37:31] i've conquered it
[1:37:34] listen now
[1:37:35] and only those
[1:37:37] whose names
[1:37:40] are in that book
[1:37:43] now remember me telling you about
[1:37:45] collateral benefactors
[1:37:48] you may not realize this brothers and
[1:37:50] sisters but did you know that you were
[1:37:52] put here for one reason
[1:37:55] because if you were in him before the
[1:37:57] foundation of the world
[1:37:58] he can't lose you
[1:38:01] the way you and i think of lost
[1:38:04] well i once was lost but now i'm found
[1:38:07] do you think really god didn't know
[1:38:08] where you were at
[1:38:11] but those words are put in there
[1:38:13] in the form
[1:38:15] of a symbol so you and i could come to
[1:38:17] an understanding of the plan of god and
[1:38:21] we were and some of us still are lost
[1:38:26] but not lost like where's my pocket
[1:38:29] knife where's my car keys where's my
[1:38:31] cell phone
[1:38:33] lost as in separated
[1:38:38] put off to a distance
[1:38:43] but god knew exactly where you were
[1:38:45] going to come up
[1:38:46] in history
[1:38:48] in time he knew when you were going to
[1:38:50] be born he knew he knows when we're
[1:38:52] going to die if we die he knows
[1:38:54] everything about what's going to happen
[1:38:56] and brothers and sisters if you want
[1:38:58] more time on your deathbed be careful
[1:39:02] because there's an instance in the bible
[1:39:04] where the prophet said you're going to
[1:39:06] die tonight
[1:39:07] oh
[1:39:08] god i can't i'm not ready
[1:39:12] my family's not ready
[1:39:16] god heard it
[1:39:19] prophet turn around
[1:39:22] a prophet just does what he's told
[1:39:25] he didn't argue with god wait a minute i
[1:39:27] just told him that he was going to be
[1:39:28] condemned and now you want me to turn
[1:39:29] around and go
[1:39:32] turn around
[1:39:34] go back and tell him
[1:39:36] i'm going to give him
[1:39:37] 15 more years
[1:39:39] but god knew
[1:39:41] that's why brother branham uses that
[1:39:42] example and does god ever change his
[1:39:44] mind about his word no but you keep
[1:39:45] antagonizing him and you keep badging
[1:39:47] him and he'll say go ahead play in the
[1:39:48] street
[1:39:49] i know you're going to get killed but go
[1:39:50] ahead and play in the street
[1:39:53] you say well that's not a very
[1:39:55] this is the god of life
[1:39:58] he's not worried about you dying
[1:40:02] he's worried about you living
[1:40:08] i think i better stop
[1:40:09] i'll finish
[1:40:12] oh well i'll get a little further
[1:40:16] you love him
[1:40:18] please stand
[1:40:27] i got two paragraphs in
[1:40:30] my brothers and sisters it's god's word
[1:40:31] see
[1:40:32] there's no end to this
[1:40:38] there's no end to it
[1:40:40] god is good all the time amen
[1:40:43] i think i like to sing that
[1:40:44] not sure what key you played in cis but
[1:40:46] go ahead
[1:40:47] god is good
[1:40:50] all the time
[1:40:53] he put a song of praise in this heart of
[1:40:58] mind god is
[1:41:01] good all
[1:41:08] his light will shine god is good
[1:41:14] [Music]

[1:41:53] god is good all the time let's give our
[1:41:56] brother a hand
