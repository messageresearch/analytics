[0:39] ready to go
[0:40] revelations 11 and that was human meat
[0:47] less read revelation Steve's first let's
[0:50] get the gist of
[0:53] they'll seal
[1:03] and I'll be able to win it opened the
[1:04] sixth seal and lo there was a great
[1:06] earthquake and the Sun became black as
[1:09] sackcloth of hair and the moon became as
[1:11] blood you know they had that great big
[1:15] earthquake in Mexico yeah and a lot of
[1:19] stuff happened there some come here
[1:21] yeah it's coming this way the stars of
[1:24] heaven fell into the earth and even this
[1:26] fig tree casteth her untimely figs when
[1:28] she is shaken of a mighty wind and the
[1:30] heaven departed as a scroll when it is
[1:31] rolled together and every mountain and
[1:33] Island were moved out of their places
[1:34] and the kings of the earth and the great
[1:37] men and the rich men and the chief
[1:38] captains in the mighty men and every
[1:39] bondman and every free man hid
[1:41] themselves in the dens and in the rocks
[1:43] of the mountains and said to the
[1:45] mountains and rocks following us and
[1:47] hide us from the face of him that
[1:48] sitteth on the throne from the wrath of
[1:50] the lamb for the great day of his wrath
[1:51] has come and who shall be able to stand
[1:53] now I was thinking this morning freeing
[1:57] myself about the people they're human
[2:00] beings no doubt but they made a choice
[2:05] and I'm sorry I mean when we leave out
[2:07] of here this little thing is happening
[2:09] in Miami is they Tuesday compared to
[2:12] what people is gonna have to go through
[2:13] right mass destruction like I was
[2:17] talking to the brother of Minnesota
[2:18] thirds me not for money two hours we
[2:23] just need to get out of here we need to
[2:24] make sure we're ready preserve here we
[2:29] may go through some hey listen but a
[2:32] catastrophe for us there's no power for
[2:37] a couple of hours not for days and weeks
[2:41] and not at all right ever it yeah I
[2:44] never get any so so we are to a degree
[2:50] less my brother Brown said America would
[2:52] be hit the worst why because we are land
[2:55] of easy we're land
[2:56] Comfort I like my air conditioner lame I
[3:00] hear there's more to it we respond so
[3:04] sure a lot of death and murder yes the
[3:06] world America is responsible and we keep
[3:08] our own data and we turn to profit down
[3:10] so that's more that's the whole thing
[3:13] that's less cause instead of the
[3:16] mountains and rocks fall on us and hide
[3:17] us from the face of him that sitteth on
[3:19] the throne and from the wrath of the
[3:21] Lamb so that will same loud that give
[3:24] you the Holy Ghost that's protecting you
[3:26] that's the level protection is the
[3:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost he said he has
[3:30] to have wrath because where there's
[3:32] where there's mercy there's also
[3:34] judgment he is a righteous judge I've
[3:38] told you many times before huh what kind
[3:40] of a love of a God though that would
[3:42] that would love us enough to die for
[3:44] and then take us out of here and then
[3:47] whatever happens it's just kind of
[3:49] happened we we can't I'm going to say
[3:54] this and not really mean all of it we
[3:56] got taking motion out of it we've got to
[3:59] take emotion sure we have human emotions
[4:01] in there you got to go back to that you
[4:03] have human emotion but if we're chosen
[4:06] people and we're the bride of Jesus
[4:07] Christ and we're the ones that we've got
[4:09] to this point by the revelation that we
[4:12] receive then we can't say never would we
[4:16] say haha no Jesus never said haha he
[4:20] said Father forgive
[4:22] in other words but we've got a job to do
[4:25] and I was probably the brother meant
[4:26] soda we got a job to get the dead out
[4:28] the ground that's our job
[4:29] the reason this is happening is because
[4:32] the manifestation of the sons of God has
[4:35] not come to a full impact come I got
[4:38] that because this manifested son of God
[4:41] like what brother Branham was Jesus all
[4:44] the ones that said storm stop stand
[4:47] still who could stand down in four and
[4:51] go storm go out of existence utilize the
[4:53] most major storm what does that matter
[4:55] going that's not even a blip on his
[4:57] radar
[4:58] right so we'll see what he is giving us
[5:01] those in power he
[5:02] killing us but you know what power
[5:03] without character right that's our
[5:07] problem we call judgment on people what
[5:11] we should be asking for mercy and so
[5:16] power without character satanic but
[5:18] power with character spit the room
[5:20] you'll know what to do in any situation
[5:21] that you're in and to me that's what
[5:24] these seals are doing there they're
[5:26] cutting away all the junk all the big
[5:29] pieces that we need to get out of here
[5:31] because remember this is the nature
[5:35] cleansing what's happening now as nature
[5:41] cleansing the land he's washed
[5:44] destruction what man wasn't here Limpy
[5:47] if man wasn't in you know we didn't have
[5:49] CP five million people in Florida it
[5:51] just go up through Florida the Tasman
[5:53] trees down they just taking the girl
[5:54] right back up everything comes right
[5:56] back you look into look out in Montana
[6:01] where those 250,000 acres burnt up you
[6:04] said well that's horrible
[6:05] no it's the most lush green place there
[6:07] is now why because stuff burns gets the
[6:10] canopy off the stuff burns then what all
[6:12] that green grows up and the animals
[6:14] actually thrive better in that condition
[6:17] than they do with the canopy over that
[6:19] nothing can grow to take a knee so you
[6:21] see how nature is nature now we know
[6:24] that Nature has fallen but still nature
[6:27] is what Creek this whole world is run by
[6:29] about make natural things son
[6:33] cloud rain alright and what is rain do
[6:37] rain washes things away sure wit sister
[6:39] floods if your if your auntie but if
[6:41] you're not
[6:42] he just cleanses the land so a nature
[6:44] cleansing then we must come and see that
[6:46] a nature cleansing has to come to you
[6:48] and I first so what I said last time
[6:52] these signs follow the believer all
[6:56] these signs we're seeing has got to be a
[6:59] sign that a believer is coming to a
[7:02] place first first yeah not not thought
[7:08] loved one down well we got all this
[7:10] natural stuff happening so we need to
[7:12] get right maybe too late maybe too late
[7:21] remember the foolish virgin woke up with
[7:23] the wise virgin right
[7:25] they woke up at the same time and the
[7:29] first thing they did was is realized
[7:31] they didn't have any oil
[7:32] so where do they go they go to the bride
[7:36] they go to the ones with oil they know
[7:39] where it's at
[7:39] why because they are spiritual to a
[7:42] degree but there are not sons and
[7:43] daughters of God they are not born again
[7:45] believers right because something has
[7:47] stopped them from being that teachings
[7:51] of man teachings of message people
[7:53] teachings of whatever you want to say
[7:55] I'm gonna do a sermon today on something
[7:58] that we all know about but once I got to
[8:00] digging that man in English just be and
[8:02] that's water baptism we got we got five
[8:05] people being baptized today maybe four
[8:07] or five and we need to we say well
[8:10] baptizing them Lord Jesus Christ
[8:12] why kebobs it well let's see what you
[8:15] gonna do that we'll do this happening
[8:17] right then we'll have a great baptism so
[8:22] baptism is not a Salvation issue but you
[8:24] will do it you will do it alright you
[8:30] can be baptized after you get born again
[8:32] you can be baptized before it happened
[8:35] in the Bible right
[8:36] the time right so we'll see that this
[8:38] afternoon and then you got the thief on
[8:40] the cross it was never baptized but now
[8:42] he wasn't a born-again believer he was
[8:45] in the Old Testament paradise and we
[8:47] lifted out a pair of oxen put into a
[8:49] place of holding after Jesus came out of
[8:51] the grave all right I was waiting for
[8:53] him I'm only there for a day
[8:57] remember ATV that Saturday rose up with
[9:00] Jesus or died Friday night rode up the
[9:01] deep something all right so everybody
[9:03] didn't raise up as a human he rose up
[9:05] and theophany and went into a place of
[9:07] holding to waiting while waiting on who
[9:10] oh you don't say you or me
[9:14] wait no me they're waiting on us because
[9:18] look because like I said last Sunday we
[9:21] were born under a contrary nature we
[9:25] were born
[9:26] faithless absolutely we were homeless
[9:30] people we got no faith we didn't win
[9:32] when you didn't when you were out the
[9:35] world doing your thing and some of you
[9:37] if you weren't out the world doing your
[9:38] thing you still was growing up doing
[9:39] things you were in healing this we're
[9:43] not faith-based right now everything is
[9:47] faith-based right right
[9:49] show me show me Jesus Christ show me how
[9:51] you died on cross I don't know that I'm
[9:53] just written a book
[9:54] show me the Peter existed I don't know
[9:56] just written in the book I'm not a big
[9:58] trouble right we don't have a picture of
[10:01] any church agent messenger except
[10:02] brother Branham I mean sure we have
[10:07] drawings but no photographs on you draw
[10:09] any picture you want you see what I'm
[10:11] telling you about us in this endtime
[10:13] week we are a fake they had to end
[10:15] literally in the first church age they
[10:18] had to take what was being preached
[10:20] every Sunday and listen to what they
[10:22] were saying and make that manifest they
[10:25] did not have a book to go back to they
[10:28] did not have a quote they didn't have a
[10:30] tape they have a Bible the Bible would
[10:35] actually put together to the 50
[10:37] hundreds yeah that's just a few years
[10:39] ago okay so what are we looking at we
[10:44] look we're looking at a nature cleansing
[10:46] that did to me this is the nature
[10:48] cleansing and honestly that's the
[10:53] hardest one cuz it's right there next to
[10:54] love me brother Claude was talking about
[10:56] a couple nine years ago why is it right
[10:58] here he said why not brother not know
[11:00] why was it right there that's the
[11:02] hardest thing be to love somebody even
[11:04] though you think they're good and you
[11:07] know what God knows if you really love
[11:08] them or not you don't have to you don't
[11:11] have to pretend God knows your heart
[11:14] okay but when you know your heart did
[11:17] you love that brother and you don't
[11:18] agree with it but you're still loving
[11:21] it's my brother Billy policy brother
[11:23] around them you could totally the enemy
[11:25] jurors transwarp he treated them all the
[11:27] same now we don't do that we don't do
[11:33] that people we ain't do that place yet
[11:37] we don't do that somebody cross you sure
[11:42] you'll love them and don't knowbut push
[11:47] them on good side
[11:50] call them servicing giving a free pink
[11:52] pillow game go through - hey Louie good
[12:00] to have you enough
[12:01] hey Manny corner the whole thing you did
[12:12] but like Jesus with Judith's Jesus
[12:15] column Judas in the garden friend now he
[12:18] didn't mean that he was lying Jesus
[12:20] don't lie but he called him friend right
[12:23] right he call him brother he called me
[12:26] friend but he knew from the beginning
[12:28] when he picked him and no one knew it
[12:32] but Jesus that's this whole situation he
[12:36] knew juices from betraying not the other
[12:39] eleven even at the time of his going and
[12:43] doing the betraying no one knew but
[12:46] Jesus and Judas he's only two people two
[12:49] new same way with you and I should think
[12:51] that's why stare brother Brown you
[12:53] couldn't tell who his friend or an enemy
[12:55] for why he treated them all saying
[12:58] exactly the same that's hard to know
[12:59] people I'm telling you it's hard to do
[13:02] cousin hard remain a bit but jesus said
[13:05] Father forgive them they don't know what
[13:06] they're doing and he was on the cross
[13:08] and they'd beat him for a day and a half
[13:09] almost didn't beat him up right and
[13:13] listen if he didn't mean that he was a
[13:16] lot of them always said the things that
[13:18] Jesus said we think sometimes seems
[13:20] contrary but if he said them he can't
[13:23] like so whatever he said was the truth
[13:25] from his heart not just a show like a
[13:30] lot of oh I love you brother
[13:31] you hear what he said in the name
[13:35] yeah but remember the property guy told
[13:42] us he said God is the segregation let's
[13:43] let God do the segregate let God do it
[13:47] we don't need to be saved guys let's let
[13:48] God do the segregate run let God you
[13:53] know back and forth can feel that God
[13:57] doing it what's happening
[13:58] that's what brother kind of brother
[14:00] kindness is coming in and take it over
[14:02] same way with this nature cleansing why
[14:05] are you and I thank you just handle them
[14:08] when they'll put everything why do you
[14:11] think that this is going to happen and
[14:15] then what's going to happen during that
[14:17] time it is because we're going to skip
[14:23] to the two prophets in Israel now and
[14:26] we'll get back to us in a little while
[14:27] but the only way that nature cleansing
[14:29] can happen is by the spoken word watch
[14:31] what happened right here these two
[14:33] prophets don't recall books to the youth
[14:37] right the Holy Ghost is speaking through
[14:41] them and they are manifesting the
[14:46] message for their time three two
[14:49] prophets and the Jews realized now I'm
[14:52] gonna talk about all Jews after 144,000
[14:56] alright and it was given me a reed like
[14:58] unto a rod and the angel stood saying
[15:00] rise and measure the temple of God and
[15:03] the altar and them that worship therein
[15:06] but the court which is without the
[15:08] temple leave out and measure it not for
[15:10] it is given unto the Gentiles that's
[15:13] outside world right because remember we
[15:16] couldn't go into the temple with you on
[15:17] the first court but we couldn't go in
[15:18] the other course for it is given unto
[15:21] the Gentiles and the Holy City shall
[15:23] they tread under foot forty and two
[15:26] months
[15:27] that's 1260 days we covered that in
[15:29] Daniel 7 new weeks running that's 1260
[15:32] days at 30 days to a month that's how
[15:35] you get you clover and sixty day kind of
[15:38] the Bible's in it I like it when the
[15:42] Bible back to everything
[15:43] and I will give power unto my two
[15:46] witnesses what is power spoken word
[15:49] that's the most powerful thing because
[15:53] when Jesus had his temptation we with
[15:56] Satan not one miracle
[16:01] not one miracle did heed to him not one
[16:03] he didn't go to he said it is written
[16:06] saying it is written it is written all
[16:11] right and I will give power to my two
[16:14] witnesses which we know that for a fact
[16:16] it's the spirit of Moses and the
[16:18] liveness not what was it allowed to come
[16:20] back reincarnated we know that but it's
[16:22] the spirit of Moses and Elijah the fifth
[16:24] coming of Elijah and Moses that was who
[16:29] was on Mount Transfiguration so they
[16:32] move over and come down in the spirit of
[16:35] the two men are in two Jews not two
[16:38] Gentiles do you angle in here Gentile ji
[16:41] was going to here you are one of the
[16:44] people let me say that one of their
[16:45] people and I will give power to my two
[16:48] witnesses and they shall prophesy a
[16:49] thousand two hundred and threescore
[16:51] threescore three times two is six that's
[16:54] sixty 1260 days clothed in sackcloth
[16:57] these are the two olive trees that goes
[17:00] back to Zerubbabel and all that
[17:02] zechariah and the two candlesticks
[17:05] standing before the god of the earth all
[17:09] right any any man will hurt them fire
[17:12] proceedeth out of their mouth and
[17:14] devours their enemies now they're not
[17:17] gonna stand there with my flamethrower
[17:20] symbolism people symbolism revive
[17:23] receive divers mouth not go go and then
[17:26] you're gonna stay up
[17:29] statute it's the words of important in
[17:31] power in power
[17:35] these have a power five proceedeth out
[17:44] of their mouth and devoureth their
[17:45] enemies and if any man will hurt them he
[17:49] must in this manner be killed
[17:51] hmm whatever you want to Bible say
[17:53] whatever you meet out that's what you
[17:55] gonna meet back they're gonna trying to
[17:56] kill the two witnesses and they're gonna
[17:57] die trying
[17:59] so don't you think after about well I'm
[18:03] just gonna be conservative 20 minutes 60
[18:05] days after about 40 days or two months
[18:10] let's say 60 days after 60 days the
[18:13] Mossad the KGB the FBI the CIA they
[18:17] don't try to kill these two guys till
[18:19] they're ghosts they're setting them
[18:19] there's no way they in touch with know
[18:21] if you think they're gonna try to be
[18:21] assassinated
[18:22] sure they are and they won't be able to
[18:25] touch him man why because the Bible
[18:28] protects them the what the spoken word
[18:29] or an event spoke so it will protect
[18:32] them 1260 days what about you and I all
[18:37] these things coming we ask for God's
[18:39] protection for his bride and he's
[18:42] already put it in place to be would
[18:43] these have power mmm to shut heaven that
[18:48] it rain not in the days of their
[18:50] prophecy now that's going back to Elijah
[18:54] in the Old Testament he said it won't
[18:56] rain for three and a half years not even
[18:57] do a fall on the ground well that was
[18:59] some laughter Penta have here that place
[19:00] was dry come over no do because usually
[19:03] like even in Georgia it didn't rain last
[19:05] year in June July and August but they
[19:07] will always do on the ground so
[19:08] something staying green but could you
[19:10] mad and he said you won't even fall
[19:11] that's a miracle in itself they rain not
[19:15] in the days of their prophecy so for
[19:17] that three and a half year period
[19:18] showing the mighty glad to say three and
[19:21] a half years he was setting a precedent
[19:24] that when he comes by that spirit comes
[19:26] off when he comes
[19:27] come to this person here there's you
[19:30] three and a half years one glyphosate
[19:32] three and a half years back any old
[19:33] estimate why because these speaking of
[19:35] prophesied that it will happen again
[19:39] sorry I've got a boom bend them in the
[19:42] throat they rain not in the days of
[19:46] their prophecy and have power over
[19:48] waters to turn them to blood no we know
[19:51] Moses did that with the plagues in Egypt
[19:53] right excuse me and to smite the earth
[19:56] with all plagues as often as they will
[19:59] so this is nothing happening now this is
[20:03] just a precursor to what's going to
[20:04] happen all right
[20:07] yeah I do I said thank you and when they
[20:13] shall have finished their testimony 1260
[20:17] days they finished their testimony for
[20:19] 1260 days the Beast that ascendeth out
[20:22] of the bottomless pit shall make war
[20:24] against them and shall overcome them and
[20:26] kill them that between them who we know
[20:28] the Beast is Rome because Rome is going
[20:33] to make a pact with them after we're
[20:37] gone since what my brother have said we
[20:40] had to get through the dam of 70 weeks
[20:42] and get it right before we moved into
[20:44] the seals because this sixth seal is
[20:45] exactly is exactly that time period of
[20:52] the Daniel 70 week the last week go
[20:56] remember he show at the covenant with
[20:58] many for one week on the feet
[20:59] he is Papa Rome he is the one that can
[21:02] master and then who is going back it up
[21:06] the United States are gonna back it up
[21:07] because we are the image for the beach
[21:09] all right
[21:10] if I got this a man done see so here it
[21:12] all fits together and for 1260 days
[21:18] which is three and a half years he shall
[21:22] make a covenant with many for one week
[21:24] and in the midst of the week once half
[21:25] of seven
[21:28] in the midst of that week he's gonna
[21:30] break that covenant right here because
[21:34] the Covenant is I'm gonna let you go in
[21:37] there and do sacrifices I'm going to
[21:39] give you my Nora because the Catholic
[21:41] Church holds the menorah we've already
[21:42] been through there we saw me how Titus
[21:44] went in and destroyed the city and took
[21:46] the menorah he took them the ark he took
[21:50] everything out of that temple Rome has
[21:52] it I said over there in Italy now and so
[21:56] what the Jews are gonna say instead look
[21:58] we want to start back to him for worship
[22:00] we got the red heifer you've heard the
[22:02] other day the brothers from that they
[22:03] were genetically modifying or read them
[22:05] for here in the United States they'll
[22:07] remember the red heifer have to be read
[22:08] and only three hours could be different
[22:10] color that's pretty rough one big animal
[22:12] this big but they say they're getting
[22:15] once they do they get that red heifer
[22:18] they say okay we've done everything
[22:19] can we have our stuff back don't you
[22:22] think here's will smarten up know that
[22:23] he's got their stuff they know Papa Rome
[22:27] has got their stuff all right and then
[22:30] he's gonna make a covenant with many for
[22:32] one week right according to Daniel 9
[22:36] they're gonna say okay here's your stuff
[22:38] back those brother branham told us once
[22:40] we leave they will watch they will start
[22:42] temple worship again black oh they think
[22:43] the Messiah's coming right and there sir
[22:47] there's their lives of talking to them
[22:49] and they're gonna turn him down I always
[22:53] said all these people did think brother
[22:57] grounds coming back you know before the
[22:59] general resurrection my general before
[23:01] the ridge race another of the bride
[23:03] they're gonna treat him just like they
[23:05] treat that lives right there but this
[23:06] Elijah's gonna walk into there and say
[23:07] look this is not you're not to Temple
[23:12] worship finished let me tell you about
[23:14] Jesus Christ and you know what they're
[23:17] gonna hate him so if brother Branham
[23:19] comes back and only pizza or black
[23:21] glad to buy he suit no wrong Oh y'all
[23:25] wrong Stefan just a few they're gonna do
[23:30] what they want that
[23:32] I want to deal with Jesus he said every
[23:35] Scripture in the Old Testament and they
[23:37] turned him down
[23:39] this Elijah Moses are going to fit every
[23:41] scripture in the Bible and they'll turn
[23:43] them down and kill all right so in the
[23:45] midst of the weed question we covered
[23:48] their diets every week what's going to
[23:51] happen the Pope is gonna walk into that
[23:56] temple walk riding the Holy of Holies
[24:00] and say I'm the god you're looking for
[24:03] because when he breaks that covenant all
[24:06] hell's gonna break loose
[24:08] the Jews now remember the 144,000
[24:11] they're going to be taken up the two
[24:14] witnesses are going to be killed and
[24:16] their dead bodies shall lie in the
[24:18] street of the great city which
[24:19] spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt
[24:20] where our Lord was crucified so we know
[24:22] left Jerusalem and they have the people
[24:25] and Kindred's and tongues and nations
[24:27] shall see their dead bodies CNN Fox News
[24:31] MSNBC whatever's left at that time are
[24:35] going to do just like they're doing now
[24:36] you can't turn on them you can't die on
[24:38] your phone without somebody in Key West
[24:40] Warner right showing the damage from the
[24:43] hurricane so what about these people
[24:45] that for three and a half years they are
[24:47] absolutely a sore in their side the
[24:51] whole world not just Israel the whole
[24:54] world is going to want these two people
[24:56] dead that's why I said all these all
[24:58] these assassins are going to come in try
[24:59] to kill them but they'll be able to
[25:01] until right here after that covenant
[25:05] broke then the Bible says after they
[25:07] come that's growth in whatever happens
[25:08] happens but the Covenant is for 1260
[25:11] days for three and half years and that's
[25:14] why the native seventy weeks is so
[25:15] important to get it right
[25:17] not
[25:18] but to get right to get the dates right
[25:20] to get everything right because remember
[25:22] if there's only three and a half years
[25:24] left according to most people in the
[25:25] message then none of this other stuff
[25:27] can happen because remember the end of
[25:30] the 70th week starts the Jubilee starts
[25:33] 250g which is the millennium so they're
[25:35] missing the time period for the Battle
[25:38] of Armageddon bringing in everlasting
[25:40] righteousness seal up the vision and
[25:43] prophecy in a normal totally they got to
[25:44] build a temple nothing they got to build
[25:48] a temple and all those things during
[25:50] that time so we know there's one week
[25:52] left after the rapture now we know
[25:55] there's only 300 and 1260 days left for
[25:59] the message of Jesus Christ to be
[26:02] preached to the - it's not be two
[26:03] witnesses there is not seven years of
[26:06] tribulation there's only three okay
[26:10] because when you get the Battle of
[26:12] Armageddon from Armageddon forward it's
[26:14] not tribulation that's great tribute
[26:17] that's the ending of everything
[26:18] tribulation is you go through something
[26:20] and you come out of it this is not this
[26:23] is you starting battle Armageddon you go
[26:25] all the way through your dear dad and
[26:27] then only the bride 144,000 coming
[26:30] that's the way she is ghostly that's one
[26:42] guy that is deceived he's trying to hide
[26:45] behind his wife that's like hiding
[26:50] behind her
[26:54] we're not trying to hide an outliner but
[26:59] their dead bodies they're gonna be
[27:00] killed so lay on the street which is
[27:02] cost articles are true and they of the
[27:04] people and Kindred's and tongues and
[27:06] nations shall see their dead bodies
[27:08] three days in the half and shall not
[27:12] suffer their dead bodies to be put into
[27:14] graves why because everybody's having a
[27:16] party
[27:17] and they that dwell upon the earth shall
[27:19] rejoice over them and make merry see
[27:22] that goes right back to the old Roman
[27:24] Empire when they would defeat people
[27:28] they have a party for all those parties
[27:30] and stuff with compliment where another
[27:32] wreaths and all that stuff and it would
[27:34] give gifts to each other that's what's
[27:36] gonna happen right here but see that
[27:39] thing they've defeated them so they're
[27:41] going to start this new world order
[27:42] again they're going to start this no
[27:44] it's the beginning of the Battle of
[27:46] Armageddon and after three and a half
[27:49] days the spirit of life from God entered
[27:51] into them and they stood on their feet
[27:53] now listen three and a half days without
[27:55] I mean they gonna be the high it's going
[28:00] up they not gonna look very good after
[28:01] three and a half days but the spirit of
[28:04] life is going to enter into them they
[28:06] don't get a body chain and then they're
[28:08] gonna take that 144,000 ride up with
[28:11] them they stood up on their feet and
[28:13] great fear fell upon them which saw them
[28:16] now can you imagine having a 360-degree
[28:20] camera view of these two people laying
[28:22] in the street for three and a half days
[28:25] indeed everybody else's party and then
[28:27] all of a sudden the reporters about half
[28:30] asleep and he looks up and they're
[28:31] standing up great fear yeah I'm sure he
[28:38] probably died and that was good to be
[28:40] bit but they don't have to go through a
[28:42] battle Armageddon the great fear fell
[28:44] upon him which saw them and they heard a
[28:48] great voice from heaven saying to them
[28:49] come
[28:50] Heather and they had centered up into
[28:51] heaven in the cloud and their enemies
[28:53] beheld them same hour there was a great
[28:55] earthquake tenth part of the city fell
[28:58] and in the earthquake were slain of men
[29:00] seven thousand and the remnants were
[29:02] feared affrighted and gave glory to the
[29:05] God of heaven the second woe is past
[29:07] behold the third woe cometh look and
[29:09] then we know what the third woe is
[29:11] that's third world war
[29:12] that's the Battle of Armageddon that's
[29:15] the third world war we think one world
[29:17] war wasn't the first woe in 1917 right
[29:20] saenko what was 1945 well forty
[29:23] forty-five second world war third world
[29:25] war is the third woe that's what's
[29:28] coming that's why I say to you if you
[29:29] don't get back 70 weeks right you can't
[29:31] place all this you can't place you over
[29:33] grounder what about your plate it all
[29:36] connects because if that Daniel 70 weeks
[29:39] ends when those two prophets are killed
[29:41] if it's the ending of the whole 70 week
[29:44] the millennium has to start right then
[29:46] but obvious it's not you got a battle of
[29:51] Armageddon now remember the Battle of
[29:53] Armageddon is going to be a battle of
[29:56] forces of man they all come to the Great
[30:00] Valley of the Miguel dominant staying in
[30:03] it's just a very big valley they said
[30:05] the blood will go up to the to the
[30:06] bridle of the horse because everybody's
[30:08] gonna congregate into that one place
[30:10] excuse me and they're gonna have a war
[30:13] and then all they're gonna do is they're
[30:15] just not stop pushing the buttons
[30:16] there's room Israel has to what has the
[30:19] sense and the fact
[30:21] SAP's and the fact is if I'm gonna die
[30:23] you going winning memory push to push
[30:26] through the pillars of the walls they
[30:29] have a thing called the Samson effect
[30:31] quick look at a point
[30:33] but if they start getting blown up they
[30:36] got enough armory to blow everybody
[30:38] outside
[30:39] so everybody don't start pushing buttons
[30:40] that's when the great battle poppy okay
[30:44] but we're not going to be you see it
[30:49] you're here to see it then that's why
[30:53] that's called the woe woe unto you and
[30:56] the seventh angel sounded and there were
[30:59] great voices in heaven saying the
[31:00] kingdoms of this world are become the
[31:03] kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ
[31:04] and he shall reign forever and ever
[31:07] we'll stop up there let's go back to
[31:12] revelation 6
[31:20] because they want you to see something
[31:22] that I think I think the Lord have been
[31:24] dealing with me a little bit by going
[31:25] back in and doing the singles upstairs
[31:28] so we may just do them upstairs too but
[31:30] you got to remember watch this
[31:32] there's always an aerial there's always
[31:35] they they pause between six and seven
[31:40] brother they'll appreciate it 40 years
[31:43] ago right cuz watch there's one two
[31:47] three four five six heels now you would
[31:52] think the Sabbath would open immediately
[31:53] but not you got revelation 7 and after
[31:55] these things I saw four angels standing
[31:58] on the four corners holding the four
[32:00] winds of the earth
[32:01] what is winds war that when should not
[32:04] blow on the earth nor the sea I saw
[32:06] another angel ascending the east haven't
[32:08] still wouldn't go there's an interval
[32:09] something that's happening then you come
[32:10] over to Revelation 8 1 and when he had
[32:13] opened the Seventh Seal so there's a
[32:14] narrable same way with the trumpets I'm
[32:17] not getting us a whole nother subject
[32:19] but when you go to the trumpets because
[32:21] right here you start with the trumpets
[32:22] you start with you go one two three four
[32:24] five six trumpets what but when I'm go
[32:27] read them all right then revelations ten
[32:32] one comes in that's not a trumpet that's
[32:35] an arrow right then there lations eleven
[32:40] but we were just talking is but okay
[32:45] where I just stopped
[32:51] eleven
[32:58] the seventh angel sounded of the great
[33:01] voice in heaven program said the seventh
[33:03] seal is the same as the seventh trumpet
[33:05] the Jews right there when the seventh
[33:09] seal opens on this earth to a group of
[33:11] people that right there it's exactly
[33:15] what's going to happen you come to the a
[33:18] thing the kingdoms of this world are
[33:22] become the kingdoms of our Lord and of
[33:24] his Christ because remember nothing can
[33:27] happen until we leave so Christ in
[33:31] Revelations 10:1 came down so we know
[33:33] Christ is not somewhere else Christ is
[33:35] here to take us out of here and then all
[33:39] this other stuff can happen but the
[33:42] world is waiting on you and I property
[33:45] God centered adoption time we're talking
[33:47] 4x4 and that's what's gonna happen to
[33:49] you and I when you see what pray to us
[33:56] to us I want to say that to us not to
[34:01] agree we've had people try to preach the
[34:04] thunders as being seven people and link
[34:07] them in brother Brown said it has to
[34:10] compare with every scripture in the
[34:12] Bible every scripture in the Bible right
[34:16] so we'll get into that so now the sixth
[34:19] seal happens through two prophets it's a
[34:25] nature cleansing mmm because remember to
[34:29] have this natural nature cleansing there
[34:33] had to be a spiritual cleansing before
[34:35] and who is that because that one
[34:41] you know let's go to Romans 8 one of my
[34:48] second favorite speaker
[34:59] 3:17 and if children then heirs heirs of
[35:02] God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be
[35:04] that we suffer with him that we may be
[35:06] also glorified together for I reckon
[35:08] that the sufferings of this present time
[35:09] are not worthy to be compared with the
[35:12] glory which shall be revealed in us
[35:16] Paul's prophesying that was revealed in
[35:19] call but there's dispensations of
[35:22] dispensation is over now we're at the
[35:25] end time dispensation this is the last
[35:28] call of the pride for the earnest
[35:31] expectation of the creature our creation
[35:34] [Music]
[35:36] waited for it to get itself together no
[35:39] that's not one said I said I said I read
[35:43] where it says waiting for the other but
[35:45] we're going we're waiting for all this
[35:46] together we're waiting for all this to
[35:49] get so I say about these all these
[35:51] different things that's happening it's
[35:53] happening because somebody has become to
[35:57] a manifestation for the earnest
[36:00] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[36:02] the manifestation of the sons of God
[36:06] this nature cleansing now goes right to
[36:08] here for the creature our creation was
[36:13] made subject of vanity not willingly
[36:15] because Adam sold us all out sold the
[36:18] human race own nature out none of this
[36:21] happened before Adam sold us out
[36:24] tornado whatever death so what was each
[36:33] fall Adam could have said no so we give
[36:37] it to a Eve Allah but Adam could have
[36:39] just said let's start over Lord but he
[36:41] couldn't because Eve was a part of him
[36:42] right literally not vigorously bigoted
[36:47] weak literally for the earnest
[36:49] expectation of the creature or creation
[36:51] now if you get that word up there
[37:00] original formation the thing literally
[37:05] building creation the act of
[37:09] establishing building the act of
[37:10] creating alright so the whole creation
[37:15] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[37:17] sons of God for the creature our
[37:21] creation was made subject to vanity not
[37:23] willingly but by reason of him who has
[37:26] subjected the same then hope in other
[37:29] words by man because the creation itself
[37:32] also shall be delivered from the bondage
[37:34] of corruption into the glorious liberty
[37:36] of the children of God for we know that
[37:39] the whole creation groaneth that's what
[37:44] happens in Florida right now why because
[37:47] what nature is doing now is naturally so
[37:50] naturally cleansing the earth
[37:53] it needs that spiritual cleansing
[37:56] firstly it needs that spiritual we will
[37:59] not need a natural cleansing in the new
[38:01] city
[38:02] mother nature's taking care of mother
[38:04] nature that's great
[38:05] mother nation state you know what Dyson
[38:08] I'm gonna keep this thing clean whether
[38:10] you do or not basically what he said
[38:11] yeah but he's waiting that whole
[38:14] creature that's one of the one I'm look
[38:16] since you wants to eat you instead of
[38:17] being friend goes he that's not his
[38:19] right condition that's not his right
[38:22] condition that it's not right that the
[38:24] animal eat the animal that he ten will
[38:26] get on the food chain it's not right so
[38:29] what if man is the highest one and we're
[38:32] right here and we failed and everything
[38:34] below us fail now what happened because
[38:37] of their description it when we may read
[38:41] a little bit so asleep when we know the
[38:44] whole creation groaneth and travaileth
[38:45] in pain together until now remember the
[38:48] ground for each birthing the earth is
[38:51] burning what and not only they
[38:56] co-creation but ourselves also which
[39:00] have the firstfruits of the Spirit
[39:04] [Music]
[39:06] even we ourselves groan within ourselves
[39:09] you think we're happy there that's
[39:11] happening in Florida we think that's
[39:12] happy that my dog gets run over on cyber
[39:14] Rover or one more no we're not happy
[39:17] about that if you're happy about that
[39:19] you need the new buyers all right and
[39:22] not only they but ourselves also which
[39:24] have the firstfruits of the Spirit even
[39:25] we ourselves groan within ourselves why
[39:28] because the nature inside of us is wrong
[39:30] we need a nature cleansing now Jesus is
[39:34] dead now he didn't compensate look at
[39:39] that and if the same one dwells in him
[39:42] dwells in you now usually Oh got that
[39:44] nature attacks to you because remember
[39:46] he was born not of carnal we were born
[39:49] of carnal so we have that worry Paul
[39:50] said that worrying and remember that war
[39:52] is between the old nature and the new
[39:55] nature Christ
[39:56] I did not have a war until Christ came
[39:58] into my soul when I say about that
[40:03] wasn't face I just live my life but
[40:07] never watch my brother Graham said like
[40:08] I said he said the same phrase do you
[40:10] have to go get your car because that's
[40:11] what I did when I went to born-again
[40:12] Christian I keep down that car go didn't
[40:15] take a thing about it
[40:16] so we use that same faith now for what
[40:21] healing and all the things we need get
[40:22] car cranking up getting a word say what
[40:25] God said getting word say what God said
[40:27] right I talked about water baptism this
[40:30] afternoon because there's promise
[40:31] attached to that not just get wet in the
[40:34] water right there's a promise to that
[40:36] that if you're baptized correct there's
[40:38] a promise and I believe we're brother
[40:40] Graham state dogs obligated to give you
[40:42] the Holy Ghost if you get baptized right
[40:43] if you mean it that's right if you mean
[40:46] it now a little talk about that this
[40:47] afternoon if you mean it you got well
[40:49] you know what he's gonna know he knows
[40:51] your heart he's the only person that
[40:53] knows exactly why are you going to that
[40:55] water if you going just because
[40:59] you win or John Winifred Wagner or our
[41:01] because if I don't get baptized they'll
[41:04] talk about me well if you get back if
[41:07] you get baptized if you get baptized and
[41:10] you start acting like them if you was a
[41:12] prostitute before and I'm saying all of
[41:14] us men included you were a prostitute
[41:16] because you are a prostitute until
[41:17] you're born again you prosecute yourself
[41:19] to the whole world drinking smoking
[41:21] gambling all your prostitute you sell
[41:23] yourself to the world right that's why
[41:26] you gotta get rid of that whole nature
[41:27] that's why they donate just gonna die
[41:29] and then we're baptized and showing of a
[41:34] good faith but now we come out of that
[41:35] water and still because I'm still a
[41:36] prostitute we just got wet we just got
[41:42] wet but now if you don't ever do it
[41:46] and God's dealing with you to do your
[41:50] pump look up that sacrament and God's
[41:52] dealing with you to do because remember
[41:53] Satan will never deal with you to be
[41:56] baptized right he will try every trick
[42:00] in the stinkin book his book not the
[42:03] Bible Amber's thinking trick in his book
[42:06] well I'm afraid the water life my life
[42:11] is at stake people that's why we bury
[42:14] people in the water we kill we're not
[42:19] going to a what I'm going to we're going
[42:22] to a death this afternoon
[42:24] it's supposed to be a man we're going to
[42:28] a killing we go to a killing never sandy
[42:30] never wears the every time you mask play
[42:31] guys kill it something but when we put
[42:34] them into water that's exactly what
[42:35] we're going that Jesus died and
[42:38] resurrected then we got when we got born
[42:41] again the old man died and we walk in
[42:45] newness of life will read the scripts of
[42:47] the second then we gotta go
