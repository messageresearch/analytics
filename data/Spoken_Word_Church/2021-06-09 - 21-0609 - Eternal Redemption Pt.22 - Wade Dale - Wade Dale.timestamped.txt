[15:57] this and that and the other but
[15:59] if another two or three hungry men show

[16:05] year
[16:07] to figure out if you're coming or not so
[16:10] we want everybody to come but

[17:27] comment that it wasn't exactly the way

[20:37] we ask these things
[20:39] amen hebrews 9 verse 11
[20:42] but christ being coming high priests of
[20:44] good things to come by a greater more
[20:46] perfect tabernacle
[20:47] not made with hands that is to say not
[20:49] of this building
[20:50] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[20:52] but by his own blood he entered in
[20:54] once into the holy place having obtained
[20:58] eternal redemption
[21:02] for us you may be seated in the lord as
[21:03] blessed i'm going to read romans 11
[21:05] 25 for i would not brethren that you
[21:07] should be ignorant of this mystery
[21:09] lest you should be wise in your own
[21:11] conceit that blindness in part has
[21:13] happened
[21:14] to israel until the fullness of the
[21:16] gentiles
[21:18] be come in so that's where we're at
[21:20] today we'll
[21:21] we'll pull the chart up in just a minute
[21:22] but i want to read
[21:24] here in isaiah we have a promise of a
[21:26] messiah
[21:27] and that messiah we know was jesus
[21:29] christ it says therefore the lord
[21:31] himself can give you a sign behold a
[21:33] virgin shall conceive and bear a son
[21:35] and shall call his name emmanuel we know
[21:38] that to have this plan of redemption
[21:41] you've got to have two things you've got
[21:43] to have someone that is lost
[21:46] and then you've got to have somebody
[21:47] that's able to redeem them if boaz had
[21:49] not been
[21:50] in the position he could have never
[21:52] acted the right or had the right of
[21:54] redemption
[21:55] toward naomi and ruth if he was just
[21:59] number one he had to be kin to him
[22:01] number two he had to have enough money
[22:02] and property and he had enough
[22:04] enough prestige that when he went before
[22:06] the council in other words
[22:08] they didn't say no you're a drunk you
[22:09] can't do that no he was an upstanding
[22:11] man
[22:12] so god came himself the only upstanding
[22:16] man there was
[22:17] that could redeem us and it was an
[22:20] eternal plan that he didn't develop when
[22:23] he got here it was already developed
[22:24] before the foundation of the world amen
[22:26] and he was down here playing his come
[22:29] down to play his part
[22:31] through a virgin that conceived and
[22:33] brought forth a son
[22:34] and as we were talking about last sunday
[22:37] this man you know we
[22:39] just for a minute for the ones that are
[22:41] that are here that wasn't here sunday
[22:43] you know you
[22:44] you look at jesus's life and
[22:47] we think we have problems right he
[22:50] didn't have many friends
[22:52] his friends that he had didn't
[22:54] understand him
[22:57] they they didn't no one understood this
[22:59] man
[23:00] this man named jesus was so peculiar and
[23:03] so different than anything else in the
[23:05] world
[23:05] until they called the lord jesus christ
[23:08] himself they called him a devil
[23:10] they called him belgium of not just the
[23:12] devil they called him the prince of
[23:14] demons
[23:15] they said you're just a wine bible why
[23:17] are you sitting around with sinners and
[23:19] and publicans and why are you doing this
[23:21] and why are you doing that
[23:22] and i like what jesus said he said you
[23:25] don't need a physician if nobody's sick
[23:28] he's in other words so he's telling them
[23:29] the physician was there for those that
[23:31] were sick
[23:32] and he was also telling them
[23:33] self-righteous pharisees
[23:35] that he can't help them this
[23:38] is the doctor i'm doctoring this group
[23:40] of people i'm not doctoring you because
[23:41] i know who you are where you come from
[23:43] remember because he told that same group
[23:45] he said you are of your father the devil
[23:48] amen now when are we going to look at
[23:49] the same thing like i said sunday
[23:51] i want us i want the devil i want the
[23:55] devil to be so uncomfortable in this
[23:56] place from now on
[23:58] i want him to be so uncomfortable in
[24:00] your place
[24:01] i want him to be so uncomfortable in
[24:03] your mind
[24:05] i want it to be unfamiliar
[24:08] territory that he's charging through
[24:12] when we start talking about the word of
[24:13] god and start talking about the
[24:14] mysteries of god and start talking about
[24:16] living right
[24:17] and doing the right thing in the world
[24:19] because listen jesus never prayed us out
[24:21] of the world
[24:23] he prayed for us to stay in the world
[24:25] but to sanctify us while we're in the
[24:28] world so he gave us provisions
[24:30] to make it into this world but this man
[24:33] even from a child
[24:34] his even his mother didn't hardly
[24:36] understand who he you know who he was
[24:38] she she lost him at 13 years old and and
[24:41] had to go find him in back in the temple
[24:43] you know and
[24:45] and left him at the feast of pentecost
[24:46] the prophet god tells us
[24:49] and she had to go back and find him and
[24:50] when she found him she said
[24:52] in other words your father and i
[24:57] well that wasn't his daddy
[25:00] brother brown said she let the bar down
[25:04] she left the bar down on that one
[25:06] because the first thing that little
[25:07] 13-year-old kid turned around and said
[25:09] i'm about my father's business i'm not
[25:12] in a carpenter shop
[25:13] so he was coming to a position now
[25:16] kids don't y'all try that with your
[25:18] daddy mama okay
[25:19] unless you really know that you're about
[25:22] your heavenly father's business
[25:24] don't use that one okay that won't it
[25:26] won't work
[25:28] because your mom and dad's gonna say
[25:29] prove it
[25:33] but see they knew she knew though but
[25:35] listen when you look in the bible
[25:36] i like when you read the rest of that
[25:38] scripture it says that jesus was subject
[25:40] unto them for the rest of the time amen
[25:43] he wasn't a rebellious child he wasn't
[25:44] someone that said bless god i'm god
[25:46] almighty why are you in here bothering
[25:48] me
[25:48] no he just told him who he was told him
[25:50] what he was doing there and then the
[25:51] bible says he left with him and
[25:53] he didn't go kicking and screaming he
[25:55] was subject
[25:56] unto them for the rest of the time until
[25:58] he come to the age
[25:59] of the 29 and a half years old to be to
[26:02] go to the river jordan
[26:03] for his ministry amen so let's all take
[26:05] that
[26:06] we know they called him bills above and
[26:08] if they call you that that's okay
[26:11] yeah because he called they called jesus
[26:13] down
[26:14] but see the to be in this eternal plan
[26:16] of redemption that's how jesus had to
[26:18] come he couldn't come any other way
[26:19] that's my point
[26:20] he couldn't have come any other way if
[26:22] he would have come a different way
[26:24] then the pharisees all would have
[26:25] accepted him they said oh you're the
[26:27] you're the main man you've come right
[26:28] here to this temple and you've you're
[26:30] right here in this church and you're
[26:31] here with us and
[26:32] well you know we got a place for you and
[26:34] you can sit right here next time i like
[26:36] what brother baby says right next to dr
[26:37] jones right here
[26:38] you can come sit right here no he was
[26:40] unfamiliar in their place
[26:43] so i want the devil though to be
[26:45] unfamiliar in this place
[26:47] i want us to say things that he don't
[26:49] understand
[26:50] right i want us to know things that he
[26:53] will never know
[26:54] and we're guaranteed if we got the
[26:56] baptism of the holy ghost that's exactly
[26:58] what we're doing
[26:59] because he can't have the mind of christ
[27:01] but you and i can't
[27:03] you and i can know what to do with the
[27:05] word of god when he gives it to us
[27:07] satan does not know how to do that right
[27:09] that's right
[27:10] he has a problem with following the word
[27:12] right
[27:13] i don't know how i got up on that but
[27:15] let's go back to isaiah 53 verse
[27:17] 8 and read this
[27:20] he was taken from prison and from
[27:21] judgment and who shall declare his
[27:23] generation
[27:24] as we were talking about sunday jesus
[27:26] never had
[27:27] a group of children as far as natural
[27:30] children because that's not why he came
[27:32] he came
[27:33] for eternal an eternal purpose to get
[27:35] his children that he had saw in the mind
[27:38] of god that would accept him
[27:39] but not from the loins but from his
[27:42] mouth a spoken
[27:43] word seed bride amen because that's what
[27:46] the sower went out to sow if the sower
[27:48] with the son of man
[27:49] you know he wasn't physically throwing
[27:51] in the parable he was but it
[27:53] you know brother dale's not physically
[27:54] throwing seed brother matthew all the
[27:56] different ministers are not physically
[27:57] throwing seed
[27:58] no they're throwing you the word of god
[28:01] and
[28:02] you've got to make sure it lands in good
[28:03] ground
[28:05] or you can kick it out or you can let it
[28:07] go by the wayside see you have an
[28:09] opportunity
[28:10] to get the word of god and put it in the
[28:12] good ground
[28:13] so it can produce 60 80 and 100 fold
[28:17] but that's your job to do that right
[28:22] it's our job to plant i go out and plant
[28:24] my garden and it's coming up but you
[28:26] know what
[28:26] i can't make it come up i just have to
[28:29] put it in the right environment
[28:31] so that god can work on it through
[28:33] nature to get those seeds out of the
[28:35] ground
[28:36] amen same way with brother dale and all
[28:38] the ministers of god
[28:39] they're sowing spiritual seed and
[28:42] they're
[28:42] bringing forth spiritual seed word
[28:45] children
[28:46] amen and that's what jesus came to do so
[28:48] in isaiah 53
[28:50] they're asking a question says look he
[28:51] was cut off from the land of the living
[28:53] who's going to declare this man's
[28:54] generation i was saying telling
[28:57] everybody
[28:57] sunday i said look jesus as a normal man
[29:01] when they saw him hanging on a cross i'm
[29:03] sure caiaphas and all them people said
[29:05] we're finally through with him we don't
[29:07] even have to have a son
[29:08] he doesn't have a natural son he doesn't
[29:10] have a wife he doesn't have a
[29:12] progeny on earth or a genealogy on earth
[29:15] once we get rid of him buddy
[29:16] we're done we ain't got to worry about
[29:19] none of that
[29:20] but they just don't know right right
[29:23] that about several days later on the day
[29:25] of pentecost
[29:26] when it was fully come that a bunch of
[29:28] children a bunch of jesus
[29:29] got born on the day of pentecost but he
[29:32] was made his grave with the wicked
[29:35] and with the rich in his death because
[29:37] he had done no violence
[29:38] neither was any deceit in his mouth what
[29:41] about
[29:42] the god of the universe didn't even own
[29:45] a pillar
[29:47] didn't even own a place to put his head
[29:48] and didn't even own a burial site
[29:51] but he fulfilled every scripture in the
[29:53] in the bible when we gonna start
[29:56] fulfilling our part of that scripture
[29:59] in the bible yet it pleased the lord to
[30:02] bruise him he hath put him to grief
[30:04] when thou shalt make his soul an
[30:06] offering for sin
[30:08] he shall see his seed he shall prolong
[30:10] his days and the pledge of the lord
[30:11] shall prosper in his hand
[30:13] he shall see of the travail of his soul
[30:16] and be satisfied
[30:18] that's where you were you are identified
[30:20] in the soul of god
[30:22] because you weren't in the body physical
[30:24] body
[30:25] you were in the soul of almighty god
[30:28] because that soul was the only soul that
[30:29] can come back on the believer
[30:31] and make you god almighty in human flesh
[30:34] called the bride
[30:37] the only one that can do that so he's
[30:40] that's the key pin of this whole eternal
[30:42] redemption plan
[30:43] is that jesus had to come here to
[30:46] release that life
[30:47] so that you and i can be born again
[30:51] because that's what he told nicodemus
[30:52] you must be born again nicodemus said if
[30:54] i got to go back and get my mama's want
[30:56] see he was carnal
[30:58] because he came here by an act jesus
[31:01] didn't come here by an act of man he
[31:03] came here by an act of god
[31:05] so he was telling us that no nicodemus
[31:07] you need to be born white from above
[31:09] and that's the part of this eternal plan
[31:11] and we'll get to that in a minute
[31:12] in the resurrection i love what
[31:16] what the prophet god said about
[31:17] resurrection
[31:19] he said this whole plan is hinged on
[31:21] resurrection
[31:23] if there's no resurrection there's no
[31:26] plan
[31:29] so we'll get to that in just a second
[31:30] let's go to john 1 verse 11.
[31:34] because we've got to tie this in he had
[31:38] to give
[31:38] israel a chance because israel was his
[31:42] chosen bride in the old testament
[31:44] he had to give them a chance first
[31:46] because you got all those people in the
[31:48] old testament
[31:48] that was depending on jehovah to become
[31:52] the messiah
[31:53] to come and save them from all that
[31:55] roman stuff that they got their self
[31:57] tied into
[31:58] the problem they didn't the problem was
[32:01] they didn't realize
[32:02] god didn't put them there they put their
[32:04] self there they disobeyed god
[32:07] they went whoring we're going to read
[32:08] that in just a minute in jeremiah where
[32:10] he had to put her away
[32:12] he put all israel away because of the
[32:14] idols and the idolatry that they
[32:17] followed
[32:18] but he came unto his own and his own
[32:19] received him not but i like this
[32:21] scripture because see this opens the
[32:22] door to everybody
[32:24] but as many as received him to them gave
[32:28] he power to become the sons of god
[32:31] so now everybody's got the power to
[32:33] become sons of god
[32:34] even to them that believe on his name
[32:36] which were born not of blood
[32:38] nor of the will of the flesh nor the
[32:40] will of man but of god in other words
[32:41] your new birth is what's going to carry
[32:43] you
[32:44] into this eternal plan your natural
[32:46] birth is going to carry you to a grave
[32:50] believe me you're going to go one of the
[32:52] two
[32:54] are you ready for both that's my
[32:57] question
[33:00] you're going to meet one of them are you
[33:02] ready for one of them
[33:05] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[33:07] among us
[33:08] and we beheld his glory the glory is the
[33:09] only begotten of the father
[33:11] full of grace and truth let's go to
[33:14] jeremiah 3 verse 6.
[33:19] jeremiah you didn't know johnson was a
[33:21] king did you
[33:24] that josiah oh just like canada what
[33:27] says josiah
[33:28] in the days of josiah the king but now
[33:31] what happened to israel
[33:32] they backslid so he had to put him away
[33:36] she's gone up on every high mountain and
[33:38] every green tree
[33:39] and and there played the harlot now we
[33:41] know what a harlot
[33:42] is as an ill-famed woman if they would
[33:44] have stayed married to jesus christ
[33:47] they would she would have been their his
[33:49] bride
[33:50] right yeah but they did not they went
[33:53] whoring and now remember
[33:54] after she did those things and see i
[33:57] said after she had done all these things
[33:59] after
[34:02] you can't take her back that's right see
[34:05] in case of marriage and divorce you have
[34:07] to be careful if your wife goes out and
[34:08] commits adultery
[34:10] you can either bring her back or you can
[34:12] you can kick her out and that's what god
[34:13] did
[34:13] i'm not going to get into marriage and
[34:14] divorce because we should know these
[34:17] things turn thou into me
[34:18] but she returned not right he gave her a
[34:22] time to repent and she wouldn't
[34:25] so he had to put her away when for all
[34:28] the causes verse eight whereby
[34:30] backsliding israel committed adultery i
[34:31] had put her away
[34:32] and given her a bill of divorcement
[34:36] yet her treacherous sister judah feared
[34:37] not but went and played the harlot
[34:40] also so now as we said before let's read
[34:44] the romans 11 verse 25
[34:45] if if this had not happened we
[34:48] we as gentiles would have never come
[34:50] into the plan of god
[34:51] but listen being part of the eternal
[34:54] plan of god
[34:56] where he foresaw a gentile bride this
[34:59] had to happen
[35:01] he knew the provision was already there
[35:03] that israel was going to backslide
[35:05] because in daniel 9 we'll read in just a
[35:07] minute listen he gave him 70 weeks
[35:09] and he wanted that when he gave him that
[35:10] 70 weeks brother bob he wanted that
[35:12] could be a continuous
[35:14] 490 years
[35:17] because he wanted to redeem him he
[35:18] wanted to get him back he wanted to buy
[35:20] him back out of the pawn shop
[35:22] but what happened was
[35:26] he knew there was a gentile bride laying
[35:28] there
[35:31] that he had to let out because she's
[35:33] part of the plan
[35:35] and as a prophet of god said and has to
[35:37] be made known
[35:39] amen so in order for us to be made known
[35:42] listen god can't be married to israel
[35:44] you can't be married to two women at the
[35:45] same time you can't have two living
[35:47] wives so he had to put
[35:48] he had to put her away so he could marry
[35:51] a gentile bride
[35:53] but now not only did he put her away he
[35:56] blinded her
[35:58] just for me and you he blinded her eyes
[36:01] for several thousand years just for me
[36:05] and you
[36:06] listen all that turmoil they're having
[36:08] in israel right now
[36:09] is because of me and you right yeah
[36:13] that's right because when we leave god's
[36:16] doing what he's going over there because
[36:17] listen he can't be over there and over
[36:19] here at the same time
[36:21] he can't have two wives like that right
[36:23] he's already put this one away
[36:25] he's going to restore her but not back
[36:27] to the position she was
[36:29] she will not be bright again but he
[36:31] can't forget her see he's got to go back
[36:33] to his own scripture
[36:34] and i didn't bring it but i was reading
[36:35] it not too long ago where he said
[36:37] how high how many stars can you count
[36:39] how many
[36:40] sands in the sea on the seashore can you
[36:42] count them and some and you know he said
[36:44] no you cannot
[36:45] he said i'll never forget israel if you
[36:48] can count them i can forget them you
[36:49] can't count them so i can't forget
[36:50] israel
[36:51] right now because they're part of the
[36:54] plan
[36:56] because there is redemption included
[36:58] there is resurrection included
[37:00] in this plan and israel has been they've
[37:03] already went through one resurrection
[37:06] jesus's resurrection the bible says when
[37:09] the graves opened and some of them came
[37:10] out of them
[37:11] out of the ground all right romans 11 25
[37:14] for i would not brethren that you should
[37:15] be ignorant of this mystery see now this
[37:17] is a mystery because
[37:18] most of the denominational world don't
[37:20] know have a clue what daniel 70 weeks
[37:22] is don't have they know one thing's for
[37:23] sure though they do
[37:25] know that god's dealing with us and then
[37:28] he's gonna deal with israel
[37:29] but they don't have no i you know i say
[37:31] no idea they might have a clue
[37:33] but we know exactly that's why i said
[37:35] about sunday about if this prophet is
[37:37] not a true prophet we
[37:39] how are we going to find something
[37:40] better right
[37:42] and it's like the analogy that i use i
[37:44] work for the post office and we don't do
[37:46] things very fast because we're
[37:48] government but um anyway
[37:52] but me and the ups driver was talking
[37:54] about a year so ago when amazon got real
[37:56] hot
[37:57] and you know everybody was ordering from
[37:58] amazon and they were given and now
[38:00] in certain places they have the amazon
[38:02] grocery thing that you can order in two
[38:04] hours
[38:06] you get your groceries two hours
[38:09] delivered to your house
[38:12] you can't beat that that's what me and
[38:15] the ups driver
[38:16] who is gonna come out of all this and
[38:18] say i'm better than that
[38:20] you can't well that's what i'm saying
[38:21] about brother branham how are you going
[38:23] to send us somebody better than what
[38:25] he's already said
[38:27] there's not anything better except jesus
[38:29] christ and a bride
[38:31] that's the only thing that's better is
[38:34] god being here
[38:35] in a bride but we're going to be here
[38:39] because he sent a prophet amen to open
[38:43] our blinded eyes because you know what
[38:45] we were blinded by denominations by sin
[38:49] by all the stuff that we did we were
[38:51] blinded but we blinded ourself
[38:54] there's a there's another quote where
[38:56] brother brown says he said he said now
[38:59] god blinded them god didn't blind you
[39:03] it's all on you now god didn't blind
[39:06] said no i'm going to blind you and you
[39:07] you can't come in no not gentiles
[39:11] but blindness in part has happened to
[39:13] israel until the fullness
[39:15] of the gentiles become end you know
[39:17] that's not the first stage that's not
[39:18] the second third fourth fifth sixth
[39:20] it's this age it's when the fullness of
[39:23] the gentiles
[39:24] excuse me there is no other gentile age
[39:26] after this one this is it right here
[39:28] we're in the end time so all israel
[39:31] shall be saved that is written
[39:33] there shall come out of zion the
[39:34] deliverer and how's he going to come out
[39:37] he's going to come out and two prophets
[39:39] moses and elijah which is probably
[39:41] already over there
[39:42] waiting the two men
[39:45] okay i think it's that close
[39:48] listen they're not going to be babies
[39:51] they're going to be grown men when god
[39:52] enters them and anoints them with elijah
[39:54] and moses ministry
[39:56] we're going to be gone but they're not
[39:58] going to be little children they're
[39:59] going to be adults
[40:01] for this is my covenant
[40:04] unto them when i shall take away their
[40:06] sin now how is he going to do that
[40:07] through daniel 70 weeks
[40:09] through the six-fold purpose we're going
[40:11] to read it in a minute he's going to do
[40:13] that
[40:13] as concerning the gospel they are
[40:15] enemies for your sake now look
[40:17] enemies yes they don't like us we're
[40:24] gentiles
[40:25] we're club carriers we're we're heathens
[40:28] they call us
[40:29] yeah but you know why they're our enemy
[40:34] for your sake my sake but as touching
[40:37] the election
[40:38] they are beloved for the father's sake
[40:40] in other words i can't forget them amen
[40:42] so now let's go to daniel 9 24.
[40:47] 70 weeks are determined we'll just run
[40:50] through it real quick
[40:51] upon thy people and upon thy holy city
[40:54] to do six things this is gonna this is
[40:57] gonna
[40:58] parallel we already done it several
[40:59] times with the six seals
[41:01] because six seals finishes redemption
[41:03] christ is the seventh seal we know that
[41:06] so to finish the transgression whose
[41:09] transgression
[41:10] israel not yours exactly your israel
[41:13] to make an end of their sin to make
[41:16] reconciliation for iniquity now
[41:18] you can do that too in your
[41:19] justification and your sanctification
[41:21] and your baptism of the holy ghost
[41:23] that's exactly what god does
[41:25] in three stages he gives you the new
[41:27] birth through justification sanctions
[41:28] baptism holy ghost
[41:29] he's going to do the same thing within
[41:31] finish the transgression make an end of
[41:32] sin
[41:32] make reconciliation for iniquity then
[41:35] look bring in everlasting righteousness
[41:37] seal up the vision in prophecy and
[41:39] anoint the most holy we know
[41:41] how that happens we're not going to go
[41:42] through it because we've been through it
[41:43] before
[41:44] but know therefore and understand that
[41:45] from the glory forth or the commandment
[41:47] to restore
[41:48] and build jerusalem to the messiah the
[41:49] prince shall be seven weeks
[41:51] and three scoring two weeks so what's 62
[41:53] and seven
[41:55] somebody say 69
[42:00] thank you brother and what
[42:03] centennial that would be 69 well that's
[42:06] 69 weeks not 69 and a half not 68 in the
[42:09] third or 68 and a half
[42:10] amen 69 weeks all right
[42:14] seven weeks and seven weeks
[42:17] and three score which is two times three
[42:20] is six sixty two the street shall be
[42:22] built again the wall even troubles times
[42:23] we know that was in
[42:24] nehemiah and um
[42:27] the edict that came from not cyrus with
[42:30] so with the cyrus or
[42:32] one of the two all right but after three
[42:36] score in two weeks shall my side be cut
[42:37] off now see this is where you and i have
[42:39] to come in
[42:40] because why was the messiah cut off not
[42:42] for himself that's right
[42:44] but not for himself he was cut off so
[42:48] that me and you could come in
[42:50] he was cut off because we're going to
[42:51] read here in luke he told them to go
[42:54] to the upper room because they were
[42:56] going to be endued for with power from
[42:58] on high
[42:59] and then another group of people was
[43:01] going to come in 3 000 downstairs
[43:04] and then we're going to read here in
[43:05] just a minute whereas the gospel keeps
[43:07] moving
[43:08] paul stands up one day and he said i've
[43:10] had it with you jews
[43:13] lo i turn to the gentiles so that
[43:16] started in there started that gentile
[43:18] dispensation
[43:19] that you and i are in now but you know
[43:21] what we're at the closing of it
[43:23] we're not at the first of it they were
[43:25] at the first we're at the closing of
[43:26] this thing
[43:27] and the people of the prince that shall
[43:29] come shall destroy the city and the
[43:30] sanctuary that was titus in 80 70.
[43:33] he destroyed the city and took all the
[43:35] menorah he took the holy of holies
[43:37] he took everything back to rome with
[43:39] them we know that rome has all that
[43:41] that's why israel is going to make a
[43:42] covenant with them so they can get that
[43:44] stuff back
[43:46] amen this makes sense and then therefore
[43:49] shall be with the flood until the end
[43:50] the war
[43:50] desolations are returned determined and
[43:52] look and he shall confirm who's the he
[43:55] the antichrist because he's going to
[43:57] break it so it can't be christ
[43:59] right christ never makes a covenant
[44:02] breaks it mean you make covenants we
[44:03] break it the devil makes the covenant he
[44:05] always breaks them
[44:07] and he shall confirm the covenant with
[44:08] many for now if you had 69
[44:13] and you need 70 weeks to finish daniel
[44:15] 70 weeks to restore
[44:17] israel and the city
[44:20] there's that one week left and it comes
[44:22] after the rapture takes place
[44:24] right ma'am just really simple
[44:28] and he shall confirm the covenant with
[44:29] many for one week who does he who's he
[44:31] the antichrist what i just said rome is
[44:33] going to make a covenant with the jews
[44:35] and said if you'll do this i'll give you
[44:37] your menorah back i'll give you your
[44:40] ark back i'll give you all these things
[44:42] that i'm holding i'll give them back to
[44:43] you
[44:44] but you got to go into this covenant and
[44:47] then for three and a half years they go
[44:48] in that covenant but during that three
[44:50] and a half years that's when god is
[44:51] going to
[44:52] send moses and elijah
[44:55] the spirit of moses and elijah and two
[44:57] men two prophets that go
[44:59] to israel or don't go to israel they're
[45:01] already over there
[45:03] and they're going to preach jesus christ
[45:07] not the ark and the menorah and all
[45:09] these things and the pots and all that
[45:10] stuff
[45:11] they don't have anything to do with
[45:13] building any temple
[45:14] they're not part of that temple mount
[45:16] people right right they're just
[45:18] not and they're definitely not going to
[45:20] be because they're going to be killed
[45:22] and they're going to have a resurrection
[45:24] amen for the overspreading of
[45:26] abomination in other words in the midst
[45:28] of the week he's going to cut it off
[45:30] and then armageddon's going to happen
[45:32] but you and i are going to be
[45:34] in a glorious time right somewhere else
[45:37] we won't be here and it doesn't matter
[45:39] because we're in eternity anyway because
[45:41] we've already went through a body change
[45:42] and we'll look at that here
[45:44] real quick let's go to luke 24 46
[45:48] and he said unto them this is jesus thus
[45:50] it is written and thus it behoove christ
[45:52] to suffer and derives from the dead the
[45:53] third day
[45:54] and that repentance and remission of
[45:56] sins should be preached in his name look
[45:59] among all
[46:00] nations beginning in jerusalem
[46:03] beginning in jerusalem but to all
[46:05] nations
[46:06] and ye are witnesses of these things and
[46:09] behold i send the promise of my father
[46:11] upon you
[46:12] but tarry in the city of jerusalem until
[46:15] ye be endued with power
[46:18] from on high or dunamis
[46:21] from on high which is power but i went
[46:23] to that word endu that word endued means
[46:25] to
[46:26] sink into let's look at the next one
[46:29] and that's what happened on the day of
[46:30] pentecost there was
[46:32] tons of fire on every one of them and
[46:34] then what happened the holy ghost just
[46:35] sank right down into those people
[46:38] to sink into or clothed in or arrayed in
[46:42] see that's when they got their white
[46:44] robes brother dale's going to cover this
[46:46] probably a little bit more
[46:49] but we don't have to go get a white robe
[46:54] see that's why we don't have to stand
[46:55] before judgment
[46:58] why would we stand the judgment with
[47:00] white robes already on
[47:01] right we stand in judgment with those
[47:04] white robes on
[47:06] which is what the white robe is the what
[47:08] the righteousness of the saints
[47:10] when you get born again here folks there
[47:14] you get your robe
[47:15] because that's the holy ghost that's
[47:17] that holy ghost veil that god's putting
[47:19] back on you
[47:20] that was taken off of adam and eve not
[47:23] taking their holy ghost away from them
[47:25] but that veil to keep you what straight
[47:30] to keep us straight the holy ghost is
[47:31] put here to keep us straight and to get
[47:33] us out of here
[47:34] but see he's already veiled me and you
[47:37] we don't have to get
[47:38] white robes you already got them if
[47:40] you're born again amen
[47:42] so don't go looking for a boy wait when
[47:43] i get my white rum no you already got it
[47:46] it's your theophany it's your glorified
[47:49] body it's all those things is right
[47:50] there and you already got
[47:52] it you don't have to go somewhere to get
[47:53] it right
[47:56] see thank god for a profit they put all
[47:58] that together for us so we don't have to
[48:00] worry about
[48:01] well when do i get a white rubble when
[48:03] do you think we'll get a white rubber i
[48:04] don't know do you think you will get it
[48:05] over there no i think we might get it
[48:06] over here no
[48:07] no we're going to get it right here if
[48:09] you're born again you already got it
[48:13] had enough of this bickering why bicker
[48:16] when he's already told us the truth the
[48:18] first time
[48:20] amen god told us the truth man's been
[48:23] telling us lies and then god sent us a
[48:25] man
[48:26] to tell us the truth but it was a man
[48:28] that was vindicated by
[48:30] the bible amen
[48:35] all right let's go to acts 2 verse 1
[48:38] when the day of pentecost was fully come
[48:40] there were all with one accord in one
[48:42] place and suddenly there came a sound
[48:43] from heaven
[48:44] as of a rushing mighty wind and it
[48:46] filled all the house where they were
[48:47] sitting
[48:48] there appeared unto them cloven tongues
[48:49] like as a fire
[48:51] and it sat upon each of them and then
[48:54] what
[48:55] then that fire just went right down in
[48:57] them they were endued
[49:00] with power from on high cause listen
[49:01] they didn't walk out of that upper room
[49:03] and this little flame still on their
[49:04] head
[49:04] right you know you see these little
[49:06] catholic pictures of jesus you know even
[49:08] as a baby and you got this little
[49:10] flame sticking up right here or you see
[49:12] that little glow that was around him
[49:14] now listen if there had been a glow
[49:16] around him the whole time the pharisees
[49:18] and the sadducees may thought he was
[49:19] somebody
[49:20] no he was hid he was hid from the world
[49:25] he was hid from those people and they
[49:27] were all filled with the holy ghost in
[49:29] other words they received their white
[49:30] robes and began to speak with other
[49:31] tongues as the spirit gave the mutants
[49:34] now way down there a little bit further
[49:35] in verse eight
[49:37] how we hear every man in our own tongue
[49:39] wherein we were born
[49:40] parthians medes elamites dwellers in
[49:43] mesopotamia
[49:44] judea cappadocia pontus asia why are
[49:47] these people all there
[49:48] right because it was the day of
[49:50] pentecost it was a feast time
[49:53] it was a feasting they all came to eat
[49:56] and boy some of them got more than
[49:58] they're bargained for
[50:00] because they left more full than they
[50:01] got there
[50:03] because they got filled with the holy
[50:04] ghost while they was there and then they
[50:06] took the message if you'll look at some
[50:07] of these on the map
[50:09] asia egypt libya rome
[50:13] cyrenes cretes arabians
[50:17] the word of god spread glory but now
[50:20] let's go back to jerusalem for a minute
[50:23] because that's where the center of
[50:24] everything was that because jesus told
[50:26] them said go to jerusalem
[50:27] and you'll be endued with power from on
[50:29] high so that's where it all got started
[50:30] from
[50:31] acts 13 verse 46.
[50:36] when we get finished with this brothers
[50:37] if you'll pull the chart up
[50:39] we'll take a look at then paul and
[50:40] barnabas wax bold
[50:42] i think it's about time we wax bold
[50:48] and said it was necessary that the word
[50:50] of god should first have been spoken to
[50:52] you
[50:53] talking to who jews
[50:56] but seeing you put it from you and judge
[50:59] yourself unworthy of everlasting life
[51:02] lo we turn to the gentiles there was a
[51:05] door opened up and paul stepped in that
[51:08] door we know peter had a little bit to
[51:10] do with that we know peter
[51:12] was the spokesman on the day of
[51:13] pentecost we know peter did go
[51:15] to the jews but listen he wasn't the
[51:18] prophet
[51:19] that opened the word to the gentiles
[51:22] paul was a prophet he was the prophet
[51:24] messenger of that first church age
[51:26] so his word is what that first church
[51:29] age was built upon
[51:31] everybody got that amen for so he for so
[51:34] hat the lord commanded
[51:36] us saying i have set thee to be a light
[51:38] of the gentiles now that's the scripture
[51:40] in the old testament
[51:41] see the jews know the gentiles are going
[51:42] to be included in this
[51:44] but see they're thinking they're the
[51:46] bride and we're the lesser servant
[51:51] but it's just opposite because see
[51:53] remember they don't think messiah's come
[51:55] they don't think they went and
[51:56] they don't think god's put them away
[51:58] that's how blinded they are but when
[52:01] their eyes are open according to
[52:03] zechariah when they see these things
[52:04] they say oh man we're in trouble
[52:06] we killed the messiah we've been wasting
[52:09] 2 000 years
[52:10] and remember what they're going to say
[52:12] don't worry
[52:14] it was done to preserve life
[52:17] in other words it preserved us and it
[52:19] preserved them
[52:22] and when the light of the gentiles that
[52:23] thou should be for salvation
[52:26] see to the ends of the earth because
[52:27] jesus told the disciples he said go into
[52:30] all the world and preach the gospel
[52:33] and then the end shall come
[52:36] this is the only time that it could be
[52:38] in every country
[52:40] simultaneously right now they could be
[52:42] listening to this service
[52:43] in every country on the face of this
[52:45] earth
[52:47] every country because we're in a hundred
[52:49] and something countries ourself already
[52:51] people
[52:51] you know clicking in and listening
[52:53] listening to us and watching
[52:55] so that's being fulfilled but you know
[52:57] what he said he said once that happens
[52:58] he says the end will come
[53:02] then the end shall come and it's here
[53:05] and when the gentiles heard this they
[53:07] were glad and glorified the word of the
[53:09] lord and as many
[53:11] as were ordained to eternal life
[53:14] believed
[53:15] jesus every time he would see a a
[53:18] gentile and something would happen like
[53:20] the syrophoenician woman
[53:21] the the um the centurion
[53:24] every time he walked up to a gentile
[53:28] he said i've never seen no faith like
[53:30] this because remember jairus is grabbing
[53:32] him by the hand hey you got to come
[53:33] touch my daughter
[53:35] hey you got to come touch even the
[53:36] little lady that touched him of his
[53:38] garment if i can just touch
[53:39] they had to have a touch and a field
[53:41] they had to have a sign they had to have
[53:42] a wonder
[53:43] the gentiles just said hey that
[53:44] centurion said look
[53:46] i know you're a man of authority i'm a
[53:48] man of authority whatever i say goes
[53:50] he said okay whatever you say go see
[53:52] that's the faith of the gentiles
[53:54] right see we've converted back to the
[53:57] israel part where we need signs and
[53:59] wonders and touching and feeling
[54:01] all right we're
[54:04] all through the new testament he said
[54:06] i've never seen
[54:07] faith like this before call
[54:11] one a dog and she said but
[54:14] sir dogs have to eat
[54:18] just throw me a crumb you know you can
[54:21] give them them ten commandments all you
[54:22] want to just throw me a crumb of your
[54:24] grace
[54:25] just give me some of your grace that's
[54:27] all i want i don't want a full course
[54:28] now four courses coming this end time
[54:30] but that girl was sitting there
[54:32] saying i just need one thing from you
[54:36] one thing a crumb
[54:39] and that believing of that one crumb
[54:41] broth zach it healed her daughter
[54:44] one crumb didn't jesus stand up one day
[54:47] and say that
[54:47] if you have the faith of a watermelon
[54:49] seed
[54:51] you have the faith of a pumpkin seed
[54:55] if you have the faith of a peat seed
[54:56] that's even bigger that's this big no he
[54:58] said a grain of mustard seed you can
[54:59] just go
[55:00] and mustard is gone you can't even see
[55:01] it you have the face
[55:04] as the grain of a mustard seed
[55:07] you can move them out and that's to the
[55:10] gentiles
[55:11] because when the gentiles heard it they
[55:13] were glad and glorified the word of the
[55:14] lord that's what we're supposed to do
[55:15] every wednesday every sunday
[55:18] glorify the lord the word of the lord
[55:20] that's come to the gentiles
[55:23] it's this is all supposed to been to
[55:24] jews
[55:27] but it's to us because we believe
[55:31] without having signs we believe without
[55:35] having wonders
[55:37] let's pull up the chart if you don't
[55:39] mind please
[55:45] everybody all right it's only 8 o'clock
[55:47] don't fall asleep
[55:48] yeah everybody's doing good but here's
[55:50] the chart we were looking at
[55:52] um julie's not here okay let's get julia
[55:56] chart
[55:56] she said she can't see this so i know
[55:59] some of y'all can't tease can't see it
[56:00] cause you got his eyes out like that
[56:01] yeah okay but here let's go through this
[56:05] it's okay can you can you pull it
[56:08] to right there
[56:13] thank you that's good can anybody see
[56:14] that kind of now
[56:16] all right so listen we're talking about
[56:18] jesus christ now look matthew 27 verse
[56:20] 51-53
[56:22] we're looking at luke 23 verse 46
[56:24] matthew 27 50. look at all the different
[56:26] ones this is jesus when he resurrected
[56:29] and this little dot dot dot shows where
[56:31] jesus when he died where did he go
[56:34] first place he went was to hell
[56:39] he wasn't in his he wasn't in his
[56:40] completeness to be on earth to do the
[56:42] teaching
[56:43] he had to go in his theophany to hell to
[56:45] another dimension
[56:46] to preach to the souls and to what be a
[56:48] witness
[56:50] i'm the one that you turned down way
[56:52] over here
[56:53] right at the flood you turned me down
[56:56] way over here and you've been waiting
[56:59] not in paradise you got to keep on going
[57:01] down further on the chart there
[57:03] in that fifth dimension and he went to
[57:05] the souls in prison there we go
[57:06] those who turned god down jesus preached
[57:10] to the ones who turned god down in first
[57:11] peter
[57:12] 3 verse 18 and 19 but thank god
[57:15] he didn't stay there brother jeremiah
[57:17] because you was with him
[57:18] you don't have to go to hell anymore son
[57:21] you don't even have to worry about that
[57:22] you don't have to worry about hell no
[57:24] more why would you even worry if anybody
[57:26] says hell just say look don't need my
[57:27] place been there already
[57:30] what do you mean you already been there
[57:31] yeah we went there in jesus christ amen
[57:33] the soul of jesus went to hell to preach
[57:35] to those people well where is the soul
[57:37] of god today
[57:39] by the baptism of the holy ghost it's
[57:40] inside of you
[57:42] so you went to hell brother brown said
[57:44] you were on the shores of galilee
[57:46] you died with him you prayed with him
[57:50] yes do you believe that amen you should
[57:54] if you have the mind of christ then
[57:55] that's why that's why without the new
[57:58] birth folks
[57:58] you're not gonna be able to understand
[58:00] right the bible must less the message
[58:03] if you have a problem with the bible
[58:04] with the message get the new birth
[58:08] it settled a lot of things for me like
[58:11] helps me like helps me teaches me what's
[58:13] going on
[58:14] because listen if if i have inside of me
[58:17] what wrote that or wrote this how can he
[58:20] deny
[58:21] and how can there not be a connection
[58:24] you know what the problem is you're over
[58:26] here you're the devil
[58:28] trying to connect with god ain't
[58:34] happening
[58:36] but if you take god and you take god now
[58:39] in human flesh and a bride
[58:42] it can do nothing but connect
[58:47] it can do nothing but connect i'm sorry
[58:50] if i hurt your feelings i'm sorry but
[58:52] listen we're at the end time we should
[58:54] be in college age not in
[58:56] kindergarten and you say well
[58:59] i don't know nothing well that's your
[59:01] problem
[59:03] because my bible tells me that that if i
[59:06] ask
[59:06] anything in his name he'll give it to me
[59:11] so i ask lord reveal to me right this
[59:14] message
[59:15] yes reveal to me what's in this bible
[59:18] don't reveal to me what so-and-so said
[59:20] don't reveal to me what this
[59:22] revealed to me what's in this bible and
[59:24] then if that same person that wrote this
[59:26] is inside of you
[59:27] he's got to open your eyes of
[59:29] understanding
[59:31] he has to or you can take him and say
[59:33] look you blinded me
[59:35] and i'm not israel
[59:39] be bold right thank god you promised me
[59:43] i could understand this you promised
[59:46] that you sent a prophet
[59:48] to not make it complicated but make it
[59:50] simple
[59:52] simple god in simplicity
[59:57] it's the devil that's complicated this
[59:59] thing
[1:00:01] man and the devil through man
[1:00:04] has complicated this thing but listen
[1:00:06] god
[1:00:07] and god through man is bringing it right
[1:00:09] back to where it's supposed to be
[1:00:10] amen so jesus preached to the ones who
[1:00:14] turned god down now
[1:00:15] he's going back up he's going through
[1:00:17] paradise
[1:00:18] he's picking up the old testament saints
[1:00:20] and he's going to put them in a position
[1:00:22] because look
[1:00:23] the old testament saints
[1:00:26] you can you can make this any way you
[1:00:28] want to but the old testament saints
[1:00:30] can't be put in the sixth dimension
[1:00:35] they have to be somewhere else because
[1:00:36] prophet god said only the sixth
[1:00:38] dimension is the born-again believer
[1:00:40] perfect faith now they're somewhere
[1:00:44] all right but they're not in the sixth
[1:00:45] dimension because the prophet of god
[1:00:47] tells us that paradise was emptied out
[1:00:50] so there is no more paradise it's under
[1:00:53] the blood of jesus christ and he has put
[1:00:55] them in a place
[1:00:56] of waiting of holding
[1:00:59] hebrews 11 40 they without us cannot be
[1:01:03] made perfect
[1:01:04] all right so jesus resurrected
[1:01:09] told them said you'll be endued with
[1:01:10] power from on high i read you the
[1:01:12] scripture there luke
[1:01:13] excuse me then he ascended in acts 1
[1:01:16] verse 3
[1:01:18] through 11 his ascension was in a cloud
[1:01:20] right we know how all that is
[1:01:22] but look how do you know this brother
[1:01:25] wade
[1:01:26] why because remember
[1:01:29] we already been through this the feast
[1:01:30] day he fell right on that feast day
[1:01:34] of passover
[1:01:37] and from passover to pentecost it's 50
[1:01:39] days
[1:01:42] why did brother brown say that jesus was
[1:01:44] around here 40 or 50 days
[1:01:46] it ain't in the bible
[1:01:49] but he can count because the bible says
[1:01:52] when the day of pentecost was fully come
[1:01:54] it had to be 50 days
[1:01:56] and and when jesus spoke that
[1:02:00] it was a 10-day period that you tarry
[1:02:03] because he ascended and then 10 days
[1:02:05] later he came
[1:02:06] back on the day of pentecost acts 2
[1:02:09] verse 1
[1:02:10] and entered into a group of people which
[1:02:14] stopped the 70 weeks of daniel 69 weeks
[1:02:17] were
[1:02:18] finished the messiah was cut off
[1:02:21] but not for himself for who me and you
[1:02:25] to insert this bride church age
[1:02:29] everybody got that say amen so now
[1:02:32] jesus himself he comes as the baptism of
[1:02:35] the holy ghost
[1:02:36] and now he's in bright form whatever
[1:02:39] he's doing he's doing through the bride
[1:02:43] everything he's doing he's doing through
[1:02:45] the bride the six being healed the
[1:02:47] dead's being raised the
[1:02:48] preaching is being done the people are
[1:02:50] being saved
[1:02:51] god is being magnified through the bride
[1:02:56] through people that accepted the new
[1:03:00] birth
[1:03:02] then john goes to patmos and leave that
[1:03:04] up there because i'm going to read it
[1:03:07] because it says and in the midst of the
[1:03:08] seven candlesticks
[1:03:11] see he morphed this is the son of man
[1:03:15] right
[1:03:17] if i understand that this is the son of
[1:03:18] the son of man
[1:03:20] this is jesus in human flesh john 1 14.
[1:03:25] and the word was made flesh dwelt among
[1:03:26] us that's the son of man
[1:03:28] everybody got that amen now he came back
[1:03:31] on the day of pentecost as a son of god
[1:03:33] because he was what a spirit
[1:03:35] right this body can't be here while this
[1:03:37] body's here
[1:03:38] right can't do that he'd have two bodies
[1:03:42] that's right he
[1:03:45] in morphed went up where wherever
[1:03:48] seventh dimension
[1:03:49] immortal sends back the holy ghost
[1:03:53] in morphy into a bride right and in the
[1:03:56] midst of the seven candlesticks one
[1:03:58] likened to the son of man
[1:04:00] clothed with a garment down to the foot
[1:04:02] and gird about the paps with the golden
[1:04:04] girdle now look
[1:04:05] this is not about the paps that's over
[1:04:08] this way
[1:04:08] pabst is this way and what's pap's
[1:04:11] breasts
[1:04:12] bright form amen his head and his hair
[1:04:15] were white like wool what judgment
[1:04:17] listen judgment began when the bride
[1:04:19] started coming on the earth
[1:04:21] oh yeah when you go to the white zone
[1:04:23] judgment not any of you i'm praying not
[1:04:25] but when somebody goes to the white
[1:04:26] throne judgment
[1:04:27] the reason they're being judged is
[1:04:29] because they met
[1:04:30] somebody that was bribed
[1:04:35] think about it you say i'm not well
[1:04:38] i'm just telling you the bible says the
[1:04:40] saints will judge the earth
[1:04:44] even angels right so that's why we had
[1:04:47] to be dispersed all over the
[1:04:49] world so that the world could be judged
[1:04:53] by the bride of jesus christ because
[1:04:55] there's nothing else to judge by
[1:04:57] you're saying oh we got the word where's
[1:04:59] the bride come from
[1:05:01] the bride is the word amen amen the
[1:05:04] bride is the word for her
[1:05:05] age you and i though are the word for
[1:05:09] the full age for the full time that's
[1:05:11] here gloria
[1:05:12] amen we get the fullness all seven
[1:05:14] courses
[1:05:16] but listen to this and his feet was like
[1:05:18] fine brass as it burned in the furnace
[1:05:20] in his voice
[1:05:21] as the sound of many waters what is
[1:05:23] waters people
[1:05:25] there's not just one bride there's
[1:05:27] millions of gentile bride
[1:05:30] that have come through these church ages
[1:05:33] and he had in his right hand seven stars
[1:05:37] everybody got that if you walk outside
[1:05:39] tonight and look between the two
[1:05:41] restrooms you'll see that very sign you
[1:05:44] see jesus standing there with seven
[1:05:45] stars in his hand
[1:05:47] and the seven messengers around him
[1:05:49] everybody got that
[1:05:51] so that's what i'm telling you if if
[1:05:53] william branham was not sent to give us
[1:05:55] a message
[1:05:58] we're looking for somebody else right
[1:06:00] because god promised seven
[1:06:03] we've only had six if he's not the one
[1:06:05] right that's right
[1:06:07] right and he better send him quick
[1:06:11] because we're already right
[1:06:12] at the end over here we got a lot of
[1:06:15] stuff that's already fulfilled
[1:06:18] thank god we had a prophet though
[1:06:21] because you know what we'd be just like
[1:06:24] david
[1:06:26] david stood one day and passed judgment
[1:06:29] on himself
[1:06:31] remember when he had committed adultery
[1:06:32] with bathsheba and then nathan walks in
[1:06:35] and sly
[1:06:35] nathan of course we know it was god
[1:06:38] making david confess
[1:06:41] but he said david there was a man had
[1:06:44] all kind of sheep
[1:06:47] and said he just wanted one he said he
[1:06:50] took that sheep
[1:06:51] in other words from his best friend i
[1:06:53] bet david jumped up and he threw them
[1:06:55] all hands on the desk and
[1:06:57] he was blinded at that moment too i'm
[1:06:58] sure because he wasn't thinking what
[1:06:59] nathan was thinking
[1:07:01] nathan knew what he'd done god had
[1:07:02] already showed it to that prophet what
[1:07:04] he had done
[1:07:06] he said oh he said bring him here we'll
[1:07:08] kill him
[1:07:09] nathan said thou art the man david you
[1:07:12] put your best friend to be
[1:07:14] killed and you had his wife and
[1:07:15] committed adultery
[1:07:17] you should have been that man but what
[1:07:18] did nathan say but david
[1:07:20] you won't die i believe that's what the
[1:07:23] prophet of god told us in the end time
[1:07:25] not in so many words but in 1100 sermons
[1:07:28] he said you have a chance
[1:07:30] not to die you have a chance not to die
[1:07:34] because of this message of the hour you
[1:07:36] have a chance
[1:07:38] there was no chance in the other six
[1:07:40] church seven six church ages in the
[1:07:41] first or the seventh
[1:07:43] pentecost you're the only one
[1:07:48] so our nathan come on the scene and said
[1:07:52] you won't die
[1:07:56] do you believe that oh it's easy for
[1:07:59] bella to believe it she's
[1:08:02] 13. 14.
[1:08:07] what about sister cletus she's 45.
[1:08:12] i wasn't gonna say 94 i'm not telling
[1:08:13] him you're 94.
[1:08:16] i just did
[1:08:21] but listen if we don't start believing
[1:08:25] we are going to die we've got to start
[1:08:28] believing
[1:08:29] what's already been sent we're not
[1:08:31] preaching some new doctrine we're not
[1:08:33] preaching some new thing we're not
[1:08:34] finding a new tape
[1:08:36] we're not uh um we don't have
[1:08:39] you know 10 books that nobody else has
[1:08:40] got
[1:08:42] and that's what we're preaching out of
[1:08:44] because we got this little secret
[1:08:47] no it's all been put in the open
[1:08:51] it's all been out there where we can see
[1:08:53] it we've had our nathan come on the
[1:08:55] scene you know
[1:08:56] david repented god accepted his
[1:08:59] repentance and he moved on what are you
[1:09:00] going to do
[1:09:02] he had his right hand seven stars and
[1:09:04] have his mouth one what sharp two-edged
[1:09:06] sword in other words what a word for
[1:09:07] that age
[1:09:08] and his countenance was as the sun shine
[1:09:10] us in the street and when i saw him i
[1:09:12] fell at his feet as dead
[1:09:14] and he laid his hands on me saying unto
[1:09:16] me fear not i am the first and the last
[1:09:19] i am he that liveth and was dead and
[1:09:21] behold i am alive forevermore
[1:09:23] and have the keys of hell and of death
[1:09:25] write these things which thou has seen
[1:09:28] and the things which are and the things
[1:09:29] which shall be hereafter
[1:09:31] the mystery of the seven stars which
[1:09:34] thou sawest in my right hand
[1:09:36] and the seven golden candlesticks now
[1:09:38] see god almighty is going to
[1:09:41] tell john the revelation
[1:09:44] so john's not going to have to guess
[1:09:46] because john was just commissioned to
[1:09:47] write
[1:09:48] what he saw the seven stars are the
[1:09:52] angels of the seven churches
[1:09:54] and the seven candlesticks which thou
[1:09:56] saw us are the seven
[1:09:58] churches now not churches building
[1:10:03] because if you did you only had one at
[1:10:05] ephesus one at smyrna pergamos one at
[1:10:07] tita
[1:10:08] one at sardis one in philadelphia and
[1:10:10] one at laodicea where was it
[1:10:12] no it's us it's the people it's
[1:10:16] the voice of many waters it was the
[1:10:17] voice of many waters let's go to the
[1:10:20] that uh word where we see
[1:10:23] star the prophet of god the star and the
[1:10:26] angel
[1:10:27] look what the greek lexicon tells us
[1:10:30] that it is a let's go ahead and go to
[1:10:31] that if you don't mind brother
[1:10:34] brother joe because we're going to read
[1:10:37] some quotes here in just a minute
[1:10:40] give him a second it takes a minute to
[1:10:42] get that up and get it off
[1:10:44] but the greek lexicon says a messenger
[1:10:47] is one who has sent
[1:10:48] a messenger from god so we were promised
[1:10:52] a messenger from god
[1:10:53] not just a norm listen we've had
[1:10:55] messengers
[1:10:58] there's been some really good people
[1:11:00] that brought messages down through the
[1:11:01] ages
[1:11:02] but we've only had these seven
[1:11:04] messengers from god
[1:11:06] that brought a specific message for a
[1:11:08] specific time
[1:11:09] and for us specific area
[1:11:14] listen really until now
[1:11:18] martin luther wasn't known in africa
[1:11:22] when he was alive
[1:11:24] he wasn't known in the united states but
[1:11:26] he wasn't the united states yet
[1:11:28] you understand what i mean but now in
[1:11:30] this end time
[1:11:31] there's full access to this last
[1:11:34] messenger with marion branham every
[1:11:38] nation on the face of this earth has an
[1:11:40] opportunity
[1:11:41] to listen to the voice of god for this
[1:11:44] age
[1:11:45] now luther now can be heard because some
[1:11:47] of his writings have been put in the
[1:11:49] book but i'm talking about when luther
[1:11:50] was alive
[1:11:54] there was they were just starting to
[1:11:55] produce bibles much less produce
[1:11:58] messages of somebody but we have a
[1:12:00] messenger from god that we have every
[1:12:02] one of his messages
[1:12:04] amen every one of them digital you can
[1:12:07] put them on your watch now and take them
[1:12:09] anywhere you want to
[1:12:12] we have no excuse none whatsoever
[1:12:16] so let's listen to this quote on the
[1:12:18] spoken words original spoken words
[1:12:19] original seed
[1:12:20] because remember
[1:12:24] behold i will send you elijah the
[1:12:26] prophet so he sent elijah the prophet to
[1:12:28] me and you
[1:12:30] he gave us an opportunity to hear the
[1:12:32] voice of god for our age
[1:12:36] now watch watch this right here spoken
[1:12:38] words original seed
[1:12:40] the messenger of malachi 4 will appear
[1:12:41] at god's appointed time
[1:12:44] we are all looking for him look how
[1:12:46] humble we believe he will come that is
[1:12:48] according to his word
[1:12:50] it will be at the end time which it is
[1:12:52] time now for to see it
[1:12:54] he will be correctly dedicated to the
[1:12:56] word
[1:12:57] as they have always been indicated by
[1:13:00] god's word
[1:13:00] and are vindicated god will vindicate
[1:13:04] what he preaches i don't see how they
[1:13:06] can't see that
[1:13:08] right he's been vindicated
[1:13:11] by what he preaches no doubt
[1:13:15] to be the truth as he did elijah for it
[1:13:17] is elijah coming making ready for the
[1:13:20] mount
[1:13:20] zion rapture
[1:13:25] the rapture can't come in any other age
[1:13:26] but this age
[1:13:30] listen to this number two let us in
[1:13:31] church age
[1:13:33] we kind of quoted it i believe we can
[1:13:35] all quote it without even looking at the
[1:13:37] at the quote but now this messenger of
[1:13:39] malachi 4 will do two things
[1:13:43] revelation 10 7 because he had to bring
[1:13:45] both of men is going to do two things
[1:13:48] one according to malachi 4 he will turn
[1:13:49] the hearts of the children to the
[1:13:50] fathers
[1:13:52] and what did he do he took all of the
[1:13:55] doctrines that was lost during the
[1:13:57] church ages
[1:13:59] of the no eternal hell the no father son
[1:14:02] holy ghost baptism
[1:14:03] the no trinity that was not in the first
[1:14:05] two or three church
[1:14:06] or one two and three church age almost
[1:14:08] because there was no denominational
[1:14:09] set up during that time so what he had
[1:14:12] to do though is he turned
[1:14:13] what the hearts of the children babbling
[1:14:16] pentecostal babies he said
[1:14:19] back to the faith of the fathers all
[1:14:22] right
[1:14:23] that's still not going to bring a
[1:14:24] rapture because it didn't the first time
[1:14:27] right
[1:14:28] everybody got that i'm gonna be a little
[1:14:29] slow here wait a second and then we'll
[1:14:31] finish
[1:14:33] so he had to do two things he had to
[1:14:34] have two messages
[1:14:37] number one caught the attention of the
[1:14:39] people
[1:14:41] number one he said was the healing
[1:14:42] campaign number one is when he started
[1:14:45] you know the the um discernment
[1:14:49] everybody got that but that was not the
[1:14:52] message
[1:14:53] that was to turn the hearts back and get
[1:14:55] what the loose ends straightened up
[1:14:58] god's not going to come and pick up a
[1:15:00] bride that's got a bunch of loose ends
[1:15:06] but he's going to come back and pick a
[1:15:07] bride up that knows
[1:15:09] the voice of god two
[1:15:12] he will reveal the mysteries of the
[1:15:14] seven thunders
[1:15:16] don't let this trip you up it's just
[1:15:18] it's the voice of god
[1:15:19] revealing the word to you that's what
[1:15:23] the thunder they made it everything in
[1:15:24] the world but just simply
[1:15:26] god speaking to you through a five-fold
[1:15:29] ministry or speaking to you
[1:15:31] personally telling you where you are
[1:15:35] what you're doing here and where are you
[1:15:37] going
[1:15:40] cause you go out there and you ask 99 of
[1:15:42] the denominational world
[1:15:44] who they are yeah we're the church we're
[1:15:46] baptist we're methodists we're
[1:15:47] pentecostal

[1:15:51] don't know about that bride thing
[1:15:53] business i don't know if i can be bright
[1:15:54] or not
[1:15:55] but i know that mama made it so i'm
[1:15:56] gonna make it
[1:15:59] right had a lady tell me
[1:16:03] old lady there to a neighbor of ours and
[1:16:06] her son is just as good as gold
[1:16:10] spoke highly of us he was a banker
[1:16:14] but he ain't darkened the door of a
[1:16:15] church since he was a little boy but his
[1:16:17] mama

[1:16:20] heaven because he went to church when he
[1:16:21] was little remember jim she told us that
[1:16:23] sitting in her house
[1:16:24] and he never darkened the door not one
[1:16:27] of a church

[1:16:34] listen we know the truth we can't plead
[1:16:36] that
[1:16:36] right my son's not gonna make it because
[1:16:39] i come in the message
[1:16:41] my son's not gonna make it because i'm a
[1:16:42] preacher that's right that's

[1:17:00] don't have to worry about the other
[1:17:01] father
[1:17:02] a lot of that stuff will work out if
[1:17:03] you'll love the heavenly father first
[1:17:06] two he will reveal the mysteries of the
[1:17:08] seven thunders in revelations 10 which
[1:17:10] are the revelations contained in the
[1:17:11] seven seals we've already been
[1:17:13] what is the seven seals redemption
[1:17:16] glory not a cloud
[1:17:20] all right all right come on not
[1:17:22] earthquake
[1:17:25] not polygamy not everything man's made
[1:17:29] it
[1:17:30] it's this whole plant eternal plant of
[1:17:33] redemption
[1:17:34] that was laid out before us
[1:17:39] and thank god some people have been
[1:17:42] preaching it for a while
[1:17:44] and one day we'll get it amen which are
[1:17:46] the revelations contained in the seven
[1:17:48] seals
[1:17:49] it will be these what divinely
[1:17:52] divine you've got to have the new birth
[1:17:54] to be divine
[1:17:56] to be connected to divine you got to
[1:17:58] have some divine inside of you
[1:18:00] amen i started to say divinity but
[1:18:02] that's the candy
[1:18:04] you got to have some divinity inside of
[1:18:06] you which wouldn't be too bad right
[1:18:08] pop loves divinity amen see what i mean
[1:18:12] it will be these divinely revealed
[1:18:14] mystery truths okay look
[1:18:16] this is a promise that they will be
[1:18:18] revealed
[1:18:20] revelations 10 7 says in the days of the
[1:18:22] voice of the seventh angel
[1:18:23] these this mystery one mystery will be
[1:18:27] made known now who it's got to be made
[1:18:30] known to somebody listen this is a
[1:18:32] two-part deal
[1:18:34] you got to have the redeemer and someone
[1:18:36] to redeem
[1:18:38] the plan of redemption includes people
[1:18:42] so it would be these divinely revealed
[1:18:44] mystery truths
[1:18:45] that literally what is literally a
[1:18:48] preached on this a long time ago
[1:18:50] literally is not a type literally it's
[1:18:52] not i'm going to just turn this away
[1:18:54] just a little bit and then i'm going to
[1:18:56] turn back
[1:18:58] no i'm samuel wadedale jr the second or
[1:19:02] ever how you want to call me
[1:19:04] i'm that literal person right i'm not a
[1:19:08] i'm not a copycat right i'm not a second
[1:19:11] person
[1:19:13] i'm not an imposter
[1:19:17] mama tell you they named me
[1:19:20] but you know what see i had something to
[1:19:23] go back on
[1:19:24] i had a witness
[1:19:28] of who i am you got a witness
[1:19:32] the bible says the greater cloud of
[1:19:33] witness right amen
[1:19:36] that's what i said you're not a type
[1:19:38] right everything in the bible types me
[1:19:40] in you
[1:19:42] so that makes us literally jesus christ
[1:19:46] in bride form on the earth
[1:19:49] adam and eve were one person
[1:19:52] literally one person
[1:19:56] you say no brother they were two people
[1:19:57] walking around but they had the same dna
[1:20:02] through that great mystery of genesis 1
[1:20:06] 26 god divided them
[1:20:08] but yet they both were exactly the same
[1:20:10] bone of my bone and flesh in my flesh
[1:20:14] literally turn the hearts of the
[1:20:16] children to the pentecostal fathers
[1:20:18] exactly so thank god for that
[1:20:22] right so this whole plan
[1:20:25] is based on resurrection real quick
[1:20:28] before we close
[1:20:29] this whole plan of redemption is based
[1:20:32] on
[1:20:33] resurrection but it's
[1:20:36] got to have somebody that can get us up
[1:20:40] right
[1:20:43] so there's got to be a higher power
[1:20:46] that has already went through all these
[1:20:48] things
[1:20:50] he's already been through resurrection
[1:20:53] now listen to this
[1:20:54] let's look at job 14 verse 12. we'll
[1:20:57] read a
[1:20:58] few scriptures and then we'll close
[1:20:59] that's all right
[1:21:02] so man lies down and riseth not
[1:21:06] till the heavens be no more they shall
[1:21:08] not await nor be raised out of their
[1:21:10] sleep
[1:21:11] seems like there's no hope oh that thou
[1:21:14] would has hide me in the grave
[1:21:18] not a bad thing hide me
[1:21:23] hide me in the grave that thou would
[1:21:26] just keep me
[1:21:27] secret until thy wrath be passed
[1:21:32] that thou would have appoint me look a
[1:21:35] set
[1:21:35] time and remember me
[1:21:39] jesus remembered lazarus
[1:21:42] he knew who he was and he knew where he
[1:21:45] was
[1:21:47] and that connection even that earthly
[1:21:49] connection between jesus and lazarus
[1:21:51] drew him four days
[1:21:55] to go see his friend lazarus so don't
[1:21:58] worry folks he's not going to forget you
[1:22:01] that's why death that's why all the
[1:22:02] sting of death has been taken away of
[1:22:04] that's why all these mysteries that
[1:22:05] well we don't know where we are are we
[1:22:06] still laying in the grave are we sitting
[1:22:08] there
[1:22:08] with the coffin we can't get out of the
[1:22:09] coffin are we are we over here in this
[1:22:11] place or we over here in this place
[1:22:13] even even the prophet of god explained
[1:22:15] to us there's not even a burn in hell
[1:22:16] yet
[1:22:17] that's right
[1:22:20] i mean who teaches that most of the
[1:22:23] denominational world that you're going
[1:22:25] to you know
[1:22:25] that person's just burning in hell right
[1:22:27] now eternally
[1:22:29] no oh that thou would have hide me in
[1:22:33] the grave that thou would has keep me
[1:22:34] secret
[1:22:35] until thy wrath be past that that was to
[1:22:38] point me a set time listen there's been
[1:22:40] seven
[1:22:40] appointed times seven church ages
[1:22:44] that have passed on yes even some of
[1:22:46] this church age has been already passed
[1:22:48] on
[1:22:50] and remember me if a man die shall he
[1:22:53] live again
[1:22:55] all the days of my appointed time will i
[1:22:58] wait
[1:23:01] till my change come
[1:23:07] he knew there was going to be a
[1:23:09] resurrection and a change
[1:23:10] right he knew he wasn't going to come up
[1:23:13] the way he went down
[1:23:16] corrupt he see man go down he don't see
[1:23:18] man no more
[1:23:20] but look thou shalt call
[1:23:24] that's my whole point there has to be a
[1:23:27] resurrection
[1:23:28] call right it couldn't be in the first
[1:23:30] church age
[1:23:31] one through seven couldn't happen
[1:23:35] why you keep saying that by the way
[1:23:36] because listen we're not in a church age
[1:23:39] i thought we were in the eighth day i
[1:23:40] thought we were in the manifestation of
[1:23:41] the eternal word of god in the eighth
[1:23:43] day
[1:23:44] sure we're living in laodicea we're
[1:23:46] living in a seventh church age seven
[1:23:47] church age goes all the way through the
[1:23:49] millennium
[1:23:50] exactly but not for the bride amen
[1:23:53] thou shalt call and i will answer thee
[1:23:59] thou wilt have a desire to the work
[1:24:03] of thine hands let's go to first
[1:24:04] corinthians 15
[1:24:06] verse 20. but now is christ risen from
[1:24:10] the dead and become the first fruits of
[1:24:12] them that slept
[1:24:13] for since by man came death
[1:24:17] by man came also resurrection of the
[1:24:20] dead
[1:24:21] there had to be a man die and pay the
[1:24:22] price and that man resurrected
[1:24:25] without that we're like job we just stay
[1:24:28] in the ground
[1:24:30] but thank god we know what jesus christ
[1:24:33] went through
[1:24:35] and look for as an adam all die we blame
[1:24:37] me for a lot of things that
[1:24:39] goes on in this world but the bible says
[1:24:41] in adam all die because he's the one
[1:24:43] that sold us out
[1:24:46] adam's the one that sold us out even so
[1:24:48] in christ shall all be made alive
[1:24:51] but every man in his own order
[1:24:56] we're not first church age listen we're
[1:24:58] not on the first church age
[1:25:00] we're not under second church age we're
[1:25:01] not under the third sure we got the
[1:25:03] anointing of all those ages
[1:25:05] but this anointing for this end time is
[1:25:07] a body change in a rapture and a
[1:25:09] resurrection
[1:25:10] amen and we'll tell you that ordering
[1:25:12] just real quick
[1:25:13] if that's okay afterwards they that are
[1:25:15] christ
[1:25:16] at his coming but every man in his own
[1:25:18] order christ the first fruits in other
[1:25:20] words he came up first
[1:25:22] afterwards they that are christ at his
[1:25:26] coming
[1:25:27] revelations 20 verse 4 and i saw thrones
[1:25:30] and they stay that sat upon them and
[1:25:32] judgment was given unto them
[1:25:37] them us and i saw the souls of them were
[1:25:41] beheaded for the witness of jesus for
[1:25:43] the word of god
[1:25:44] which had not worshipped the beast
[1:25:45] neither his image neither had received
[1:25:47] his mark upon their forehead
[1:25:48] or in their hands that they lived and
[1:25:50] reigned with christ
[1:25:51] one thousand years but the rest of the
[1:25:55] dead lived not again until the thousand
[1:25:56] years were finished
[1:25:58] this is the first resurrection this is
[1:26:00] the resurrection you and i must pinpoint
[1:26:02] it's the first resurrection listen if
[1:26:05] you're born again you'll come up in the
[1:26:06] first resurrection if you're not born
[1:26:08] again you're gonna have to wait to the
[1:26:09] second resurrection
[1:26:10] and that's just pretty simple because
[1:26:12] look blessed and holy is he
[1:26:14] that has part in the first resurrection
[1:26:16] now hold on just a minute he said i'm
[1:26:17] not gonna die that's okay you can be a
[1:26:19] part you're gonna be a part of it still
[1:26:22] there's got to be a shout a voice
[1:26:24] trumpet right
[1:26:26] got to be somebody that announces this
[1:26:29] part blessed and holy is he that has
[1:26:31] part
[1:26:32] in the first resurrection you know the
[1:26:34] whole bride that's alive and passed on
[1:26:36] is going to have part in that
[1:26:37] first resurrection amen
[1:26:41] on such the second death hath no
[1:26:44] power glory oh my
[1:26:48] but they shall be priests of god and of
[1:26:50] christ and shall reign with him
[1:26:53] one thousand years a couple more
[1:26:56] scriptures will be done because we gotta
[1:26:58] get to first thessalonians and let's see
[1:27:01] the order of this
[1:27:04] first thessalonians 4 13
[1:27:08] but i would not have you be ignorant
[1:27:10] brethren concerning them which are
[1:27:11] asleep
[1:27:12] that you sorrow not even as others which
[1:27:15] have no hope
[1:27:16] and that's the truth a lot of people
[1:27:18] don't have hope
[1:27:19] they don't know where they're at they
[1:27:20] don't know where their loved ones made
[1:27:21] it they don't know how they got there or
[1:27:23] where they're going or how they're
[1:27:24] coming back here
[1:27:27] but we do we know the whole order of
[1:27:30] this thing
[1:27:32] for if we believe that jesus died and
[1:27:34] rose again
[1:27:35] even so them also which sleep in jesus
[1:27:39] shall god bring with him he didn't say
[1:27:40] anything about death sleep with jesus in
[1:27:42] jesus
[1:27:43] for this we say unto you by the word of
[1:27:45] the lord that we which are alive and
[1:27:48] remain
[1:27:50] wow
[1:27:53] that's me and you are you alive tonight
[1:27:57] some of you are some of you are not or
[1:27:59] you're either collect your eyes closed
[1:28:00] anyway
[1:28:01] yeah but if if you want to put yourself
[1:28:04] in a scripture
[1:28:05] an updated today scripture that's it
[1:28:10] that's it right there
[1:28:11] [Applause]
[1:28:13] updated today
[1:28:16] every day you live it keeps updating to
[1:28:19] the day
[1:28:21] that we which are alive and remain unto
[1:28:23] the coming of the lord shall not prevent
[1:28:25] them which are asleep
[1:28:26] for the lord himself shall descend from
[1:28:28] heaven with a shout
[1:28:30] voice of an arch angel and the trump of
[1:28:32] god now we know there's
[1:28:34] we know what happened not a hype
[1:28:39] but a message but but listen that
[1:28:41] message did once you saw the message of
[1:28:43] the hour
[1:28:44] it's like somebody said hey
[1:28:49] and what'd you do you turned away from
[1:28:51] what that other little bitty voice was
[1:28:52] talking to you
[1:28:53] and you heard that voice the voice of
[1:28:56] the archangel and the trump of god
[1:28:59] and the dead in christ shall rise
[1:29:02] first first let's don't worry about a
[1:29:06] body change let's don't worry about the
[1:29:07] day of a rapture
[1:29:08] we got to get the dead saints out of the
[1:29:10] ground first
[1:29:12] then we which are alive and remain
[1:29:16] shall be caught up together with them in
[1:29:18] the clouds
[1:29:20] to meet the lord in the air and so shall
[1:29:21] ever we ever be with the lord
[1:29:23] wherefore comfort one another with these
[1:29:25] words i'm gonna back these scriptures
[1:29:26] back up next week
[1:29:27] let's read first corinthians 15 47 and
[1:29:30] then we'll close right here musicians
[1:29:31] get ready to come
[1:29:33] the first manners of the earth earthy
[1:29:35] i'm looking at it right now
[1:29:37] this is the earthy man we were all born
[1:29:39] earthy men and women
[1:29:42] the second man is the lord from heaven
[1:29:44] glory your second birth is what you
[1:29:46] better be
[1:29:47] depending on because your first birth
[1:29:51] will kill you your second birth will
[1:29:54] kill you
[1:29:55] but give you eternal life because it
[1:29:58] destroys the old man remember
[1:30:00] as is the earthy such are they also that
[1:30:03] are earthy
[1:30:05] we've seen some of them right there's
[1:30:07] some earthy people
[1:30:08] they love this earth they love being
[1:30:10] here they love doing stuff on this earth
[1:30:13] so do i but not none of this junk that's
[1:30:15] going on now
[1:30:17] and as is the heavenly such as they that
[1:30:20] are heavenly
[1:30:21] and as we have borne the image of the
[1:30:23] earthy
[1:30:24] looking at it now we shall also bear the
[1:30:27] image of the heavenly if you're born
[1:30:29] again
[1:30:32] now this i say brethren that flesh and
[1:30:34] blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god
[1:30:36] neither does corruption inherit
[1:30:38] incorruption
[1:30:40] everybody got that you sow flesh and
[1:30:42] blood the corruptible part
[1:30:44] this has got to be changed it's not
[1:30:47] going to be done away with and you get a
[1:30:49] new one
[1:30:50] he's going to change this one from what
[1:30:52] from corruption
[1:30:54] to incorruption behold i show you a
[1:30:57] mystery
[1:30:58] we shall not all sleep amen
[1:31:02] you want to put yourself in another
[1:31:04] scripture there's another one
[1:31:06] we shall not all sleep but we shall
[1:31:10] all be changed in a moment in the
[1:31:13] twinkling of an eye at the last trump
[1:31:15] for the trumpet shall sound
[1:31:17] and the dead shall be raised what
[1:31:19] incorruptible
[1:31:21] and we shall be chained and we shall be
[1:31:24] changed so they got we got to have a
[1:31:25] resurrection first
[1:31:28] then we'll be changed for this
[1:31:31] corruptable
[1:31:32] must put on incorruption and this mortal
[1:31:35] must put on immortality
[1:31:37] so when this corruptable shall have put
[1:31:39] on incorruption what a promise
[1:31:41] and this mortal shall have put on
[1:31:43] immortality then shall be brought to
[1:31:45] pass the same that is written
[1:31:47] death is swallowed up in victory
[1:31:50] o death where is your sting o grave
[1:31:52] where is thy victory the sting of death
[1:31:54] is sin
[1:31:55] and the strength of sin is the law but
[1:31:57] thanks be to god
[1:31:59] which giveth us the victory through our
[1:32:02] lord jesus christ
[1:32:04] thank god musicians come
[1:32:12] but we know somewhere in this message
[1:32:14] not james dobson
[1:32:16] not joel osteen
[1:32:21] kenneth hagin kenneth copeland i hope
[1:32:24] they called me when i if i since i
[1:32:25] announced their name online i hope they
[1:32:27] do
[1:32:29] but then listen are you ashamed of what
[1:32:32] you believe
[1:32:33] no sir i'm like brother dale i'll
[1:32:37] challenge anybody
[1:32:38] amen own this word of god
[1:32:42] but they don't have the shout or the
[1:32:45] voice or the trumpet they're not
[1:32:47] included in this if they're not bribed
[1:32:50] you're not included
[1:32:53] yes this is inclusive
[1:32:56] yes it is segregationalism but it's god
[1:33:00] doing the segregating
[1:33:01] right he wants us to segregate from the
[1:33:05] things of the world get out of that
[1:33:07] stuff that we're in
[1:33:14] the world is waiting
[1:33:18] for that shout and a voice
[1:33:22] and a trumpet because they'll preach it
[1:33:25] but you and i have already received it
[1:33:29] see to us i don't mean it's old news but
[1:33:31] to us
[1:33:32] we know what that is we know where to go
[1:33:35] to get it oh glory
[1:33:36] they do not right they do not they're
[1:33:39] wandering stars they're wandering out
[1:33:41] wondering whether well what shout is it
[1:33:43] is it a hey
[1:33:46] no it's a message that was sent to get
[1:33:48] your attention right
[1:33:50] and then you heard from the voice
[1:33:54] of god you didn't hear the voice of
[1:33:55] william brown you heard the voice of god
[1:34:00] the shout the voice
[1:34:03] and brother brown said that was a
[1:34:04] resurrection trumpet
[1:34:06] and i believe we're getting ready
[1:34:08] because it's got to come first
[1:34:10] that's the next thing we're looking at
[1:34:12] is the dead
[1:34:13] and christ shall rise first
[1:34:16] and then we which are alive and remain
[1:34:19] shall be caught up together
[1:34:22] but thank god this whole plan
[1:34:25] hinged on one person saying destroy this
[1:34:29] body
[1:34:31] and i'll raise it up in three days he
[1:34:33] said well man some
[1:34:34] you know they said one man never spoke
[1:34:36] like this before no they know ever
[1:34:38] there's never a man said i'm gonna die
[1:34:40] and three days later you're gonna see me
[1:34:42] again
[1:34:44] and he said it lazarus didn't lavish
[1:34:46] just got sick and died he didn't know
[1:34:47] what was going on
[1:34:48] yeah but jesus stood up one day and he
[1:34:51] said you destroy this temple in three
[1:34:53] days you're gonna see it again
[1:34:55] they said well what are you talking
[1:34:56] about he said ain't talking about that
[1:34:58] i ain't talking about that temple out
[1:34:59] there i'm talking about this temple

[1:37:29] it's the grace that still says
[1:37:38] to praise
[1:37:51] brother ernieville nueva just passed
[1:37:53] away
[1:38:00] don't know any details we just got to
[1:38:02] got a message
[1:38:10] sometimes you don't understand things
[1:38:13] but who's in control god's in control
[1:38:17] we never questioned it was his time
[1:38:21] and i'll guarantee you that man was
[1:38:23] ready
[1:38:26] they probably had to get out of his way
[1:38:30] going into that sixth dimension and we
[1:38:32] can laugh about that because we know
[1:38:33] where he's at we know where he doesn't
[1:38:35] change
[1:38:36] he's the same brother ernie he's done
[1:38:38] running tiptoes up against somebody
[1:38:40] knocks him down probably
[1:38:41] saying hello first time i met the man he
[1:38:42] about knocked me down
[1:38:45] but we don't know the details maybe
[1:38:46] we'll find out later it doesn't really
[1:38:48] matter he's passed on
[1:38:50] so uh let's remember the family
[1:38:53] i don't know if any of his family is
[1:38:54] alive is it mama or daddy or something
[1:38:58] but but we all love brother honey amen
[1:39:02] we'll see him again we won't see him in
[1:39:06] that old body
[1:39:08] nope sure they're going to plant it in
[1:39:10] corruption
[1:39:13] but it ain't going to stay there
[1:39:16] it's going to be raised in corruption
[1:39:19] what brother ernie preached
[1:39:21] is going to come to pass amen because he
[1:39:24] preached a resurrection message
[1:39:27] and a positive message and even in the
[1:39:30] light of all this
[1:39:31] we still need to be positive for him for
[1:39:34] brother ernie
[1:39:36] he just talked to dad not not too long
[1:39:38] ago we were going to try to get him to
[1:39:39] come
[1:39:40] come down maybe a little bit later on
[1:39:42] this year
[1:39:43] but um god bless you don't let this mate
[1:39:46] don't let us be sad
[1:39:48] we're supposed to rejoice sorry
[1:39:52] oh my lord that's why he maybe it's when
[1:39:55] he's two he knocked down
[1:39:58] but uh brother ernie liked to jump and
[1:40:00] hug
[1:40:01] he jumped and then he hugged you you
[1:40:02] just mad make sure you caught him
[1:40:05] when he hugged you but uh
[1:40:10] we're supposed to rejoice when this
[1:40:11] happens but i guess being human beings
[1:40:14] it ain't happening right now for me but
[1:40:17] uh
[1:40:19] but we know he's happy he's
[1:40:22] met what he's preached he's
[1:40:25] met the people that he's preached to
[1:40:28] this went on he's meeting with him right
[1:40:31] now
[1:40:32] and that should be a joyous time because
[1:40:35] he'll never have no sorrow no more he'll
[1:40:37] never have to wear them
[1:40:38] silly boots that he wears for all that
[1:40:40] um
[1:40:41] stuff in his legs his neuropathy
[1:40:46] i was thinking when i went and let your
[1:40:47] dog out couple days ago you know
[1:40:49] you're welcome but the last time i saw
[1:40:52] brother gary standing up was on that
[1:40:54] porch
[1:40:54] not when it was in you know but when it
[1:40:56] was just a regular porch
[1:40:58] and it brought back memories but you
[1:41:01] know what
[1:41:01] they're good ones anybody you've met
[1:41:05] that's the bride of jesus christ they
[1:41:06] can't be bad memories
[1:41:09] who in the world could think a bad
[1:41:10] memory of brother ernie
[1:41:13] find one but don't waste your time
[1:41:16] because you ain't going to
[1:41:19] but uh god bless you um like i said
[1:41:22] maybe we'll know some more about it
[1:41:23] later on but
[1:41:24] really doesn't matter
[1:41:28] we just need to pray for the people in
[1:41:29] cloverdale i don't know if they were
[1:41:31] able to i know canada was locked down
[1:41:33] tight i don't know if they were able to
[1:41:36] go across the board or any
[1:41:37] at all to go to brother biscuits
[1:41:41] and i don't know if brother biscuit can
[1:41:42] come to
[1:41:44] washington to to do the funeral so but
[1:41:47] maybe
[1:41:47] god will make a provision because he
[1:41:50] loved his pastor

[1:41:54] loved brother uh
