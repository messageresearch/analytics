[2:08] perfect faith um sometimes when i when
[2:12] i'm you know when i'm reading what
[2:13] brother graham said
[2:14] little little things that he says and a
[2:16] message will pop out and
[2:17] so just kind of want to call out getting
[2:19] into position for perfect faith
[2:22] let's go to the lord in prayer before we
[2:24] go to the word
[2:25] lord god we're so grateful to be able to
[2:27] gather together and
[2:28] look into your word lord and we know
[2:30] that the scripture says when a man finds
[2:32] a pearl
[2:33] of great price he just sells everything
[2:34] so he can get it and lord we know lord
[2:37] that your word is like
[2:38] it's like a great big field that we go
[2:40] treasure hunting in lord and tonight
[2:42] lord
[2:42] i want to go through your word and find
[2:44] these little treasures lord jesus that
[2:45] will give
[2:46] your people edification and strength
[2:48] lord jesus it'll help somebody along
[2:50] life's road and
[2:51] maybe there's somebody this evening lord
[2:53] is battling something and
[2:55] going through something in life and i
[2:57] pray god that tonight
[2:59] you'll give them something from your
[3:00] great treasure box pull something out
[3:02] lol god that
[3:03] lord they might be able to be equipped
[3:05] with lord we ask your blessing upon the
[3:08] reading of this word lord tonight and
[3:09] your ask your blessing upon this service
[3:11] lord that you'll come
[3:12] and be welcome here among us lord jesus
[3:15] lord god you've given us the power of
[3:16] your word
[3:18] lord give us the strength of your spirit
[3:20] lord to come and quicken it lord and
[3:22] make it alive to us
[3:23] it'll come and live in our hearts lord
[3:25] we ask and pray in the name of the lord
[3:27] jesus christ
[3:28] amen so getting
[3:32] into position for perfect faith
[3:35] now uh this is this is uh
[3:38] one of those you know kind of perplexing
[3:41] scriptures
[3:42] even brother branham when he would read
[3:44] he talked about
[3:45] he would read this talking about coming
[3:46] to a place where you could speak and all
[3:48] these kind of things he would
[3:49] he would say it for a while it stumbled
[3:51] and everything but let's read it and
[3:53] see what it says mark chapter 11 verse
[3:56] 22 27
[3:57] and jesus answering saith unto them have
[3:59] faith in god
[4:01] for verily i say unto you that whosoever
[4:03] shall say unto this mountain be thou
[4:05] removed and be thou
[4:06] cast into the sea and shall not doubt in
[4:10] his heart
[4:11] but shall believe that those things
[4:13] which he saith
[4:14] shall come to pass he shall have
[4:18] whatsoever he says
[4:22] now think about that that if you if you
[4:25] come to a place where there's no doubt
[4:27] that all the doubts are moved and you
[4:29] you come into a position for perfect
[4:31] faith
[4:32] you can say to this mountain be thou
[4:33] removed and be cast into the sea
[4:37] and it will happen therefore i say unto
[4:39] you
[4:40] what things soever you desire when you
[4:42] pray
[4:43] believe that you receive them and ye
[4:45] shall have them
[4:46] right now there's another just see jesus
[4:49] is telling his disciples he's setting
[4:50] them up for a position
[4:51] to have faith to believe and he's
[4:54] telling now listen when you pray
[4:56] don't come groveling and everything but
[4:58] come confidently
[5:00] and boldly believing that the things
[5:02] that you're asking for
[5:04] that you already receive them amen and i
[5:07] love this is one of our favorite verses
[5:11] we need because you know a lot of times
[5:12] when you pray you'll get in your mind
[5:14] that you're supposed to you know hold
[5:15] your hands a certain way or
[5:16] or kind of uh lay on the floor or get on
[5:19] your knees or whatever now
[5:20] but this jesus says when
[5:23] when ye stand pray
[5:26] and you know what the scripture also
[5:27] says when you've done all you can do
[5:29] stan
[5:30] and he's talking about he's talking
[5:31] about here somebody that's
[5:33] coming confidently not groveling and all
[5:36] those kind of things but
[5:38] somebody's standing on what they believe
[5:41] when you stand praying forgive
[5:45] oh my amen if you have all against any
[5:49] that your father also which is in heaven
[5:51] may forgive you your trespasses
[5:54] but if ye do not forgive neither will
[5:57] your father which is in heaven forgive
[5:59] your trespasses
[6:01] you may be seated the lord at his
[6:02] blessing to the reading of the word
[6:05] now there's a lot packed into that
[6:06] scripture
[6:09] let's see if we'll unpack what we can
[6:11] unpack and find in the in the treasure
[6:13] hunt tonight
[6:15] and uh i don't have too many quotes so
[6:17] we'll
[6:18] maybe we won't hold you too long tonight
[6:21] but kind of start off on this
[6:23] you know brother browning when he was
[6:24] preaching this sermon he you right after
[6:26] right as you're reading this scripture
[6:28] he's he's talking about jesus is setting
[6:29] everybody in position for faith
[6:31] and and lays down to stand praying and
[6:33] have confidence in all these things that
[6:35] we just read and then he kind of throws
[6:36] that right there in the middle
[6:38] you got to forgive forgive now now you
[6:40] think about that when you come when
[6:42] you're when you're down there in your
[6:43] prayer closet or
[6:44] riding in your car or whatever and you
[6:46] begin to tell god that you believe his
[6:48] word and make your confession boldly and
[6:50] all those things and then there's a
[6:51] little hiccup
[6:52] there's something that you got against
[6:54] somebody and you see god
[6:55] to have to come to a position of faith
[6:58] of perfect faith
[6:59] where all doubt is gone there's nothing
[7:01] in the way
[7:02] you got to get rid of all of the things
[7:05] that you've got against
[7:06] other people and see yeah i remember
[7:08] last time i was preaching i kind of got
[7:10] on uh
[7:10] offenses and things like that but see
[7:12] what think what builds up in people was
[7:14] when you
[7:14] get around one another offenses begin to
[7:17] build up and you begin to build up
[7:18] complexes against one another you begin
[7:20] to think that somebody's got something
[7:21] against you
[7:22] and it becomes a blocker and you'll
[7:24] never be able to move past that you'll
[7:25] never be able to move beyond that
[7:27] if you can't forgive one another so
[7:29] forgiveness from god is actually
[7:31] predicated on you forgiving one another
[7:34] if you can't forgive your brother who
[7:35] have you seen how is god how do you
[7:37] expect god to forgive you
[7:38] how do you expect god to forgive you of
[7:40] the great big mountain of things when
[7:41] you can't forgive somebody of just
[7:43] a a a little smaller i was kind of
[7:46] contemplating the other day about how
[7:48] we get so tore up with little small
[7:50] things when there was stephen with
[7:52] getting rocks hurled up against his head
[7:54] getting his skull cracked and
[7:55] and all those things and we we account
[7:58] many times a little small things as
[8:00] something big
[8:01] we got to lay those those those those
[8:03] things aside if we want to have
[8:05] get come to a position of perfect faith
[8:08] brother
[8:09] brother bob that was an unpleasant way
[8:10] to start this sermon i wish you would
[8:12] get off of those kind of
[8:13] meddling kind of things but you see that
[8:15] these things are necessary
[8:17] to bring us to a place where we can have
[8:19] confidence before god
[8:20] because god wants you to come to a place
[8:22] where you can have confidence where you
[8:24] can approach him
[8:25] boldly with confidence now think if you
[8:28] could
[8:28] think if you could just if you're not at
[8:30] that place yet if you could imagine what
[8:32] it would be like to be able to get on
[8:33] your knees
[8:34] and approach god confidently knowing
[8:36] that there's nothing that you have
[8:38] against
[8:38] anybody else that your slate is clean
[8:41] that you don't have anything against
[8:43] anybody else that you've
[8:44] maybe even the ones that you think have
[8:46] something against you you've gone to
[8:47] them and you've straightened it all out
[8:49] and
[8:49] everything's laid bare and then you see
[8:51] then you can have confidence to come
[8:53] before before
[8:54] god boldly professing and confessing
[8:56] that what you believe his word that you
[8:58] that you know he is the god that he is
[9:01] your god the god that you serve
[9:03] and you can come boldly professing you
[9:05] can stand like jesus said stand
[9:08] upon his word stand confidently on what
[9:10] you know to be right
[9:12] you see sometimes we got we just got
[9:14] forgive means to just let go and
[9:16] sometimes we gotta just
[9:17] let stuff go even you know many times we
[9:21] quote the lord's prayer luke
[9:22] chapter 11 and and i think one of the
[9:25] other gospels is really where it's
[9:27] laid out more plainly but in luke
[9:28] chapter 11 it says give us day by day
[9:30] our daily bread
[9:32] and forgive us our sins for we also
[9:34] forgive everyone everyone that is
[9:37] indebted to us
[9:38] my that's a that's that seems like it's
[9:41] asking a lot but
[9:42] if you can forgive everyone that is
[9:44] indebted to you it will free things up
[9:46] so that you can come with confidence
[9:48] it'll free you it lifts
[9:50] it lifts that burden off of you and god
[9:52] wants you to be free of all the burden
[9:54] you know that's one of the promises that
[9:56] we get we have access to in the message
[9:58] is freedom that when you receive the
[10:00] word and you're able to just let stuff
[10:03] go
[10:03] and come to god boldly it gives you
[10:05] freedom freedom is one of the benefits
[10:08] of the message of serving god freedom
[10:10] and liberty to serve him
[10:11] freedom to be able to just to grab a
[10:14] hold of his promises and say
[10:15] i believe it and there's nothing that's
[10:17] holding me back
[10:18] freedom to let other things let things
[10:21] go all these ways that so easily be
[10:23] beset us now now let's get into the
[10:26] topic here
[10:27] what is faith now brother braham said
[10:30] you cannot be saved without faith and
[10:32] and he talked about how faith actually
[10:34] declares or it speaks
[10:36] for itself now think about that that
[10:38] faith when you've got
[10:40] faith faith is the thing that does the
[10:42] speaking on its own behalf
[10:44] faith is this thing that that declares
[10:46] whether it's actually there or not
[10:48] and that now now let's let's kind of get
[10:50] down to the we'll say the nitty-gritty
[10:53] get down to the where the rubber meets
[10:54] the road because the devil
[10:56] the devil will sit maybe the devil's
[10:58] sitting here right here in this sermon
[10:59] he pro
[11:00] he probably is sitting there right there
[11:02] right here in the pews next to you
[11:03] listening and the devil
[11:04] believes and trembles the bible says the
[11:07] devil will listen and he acknowledges
[11:09] that that god is god there's no other
[11:11] god beside him he acknowledges
[11:13] that all these things are are you know
[11:16] technically true
[11:17] and so of course the the devil believes
[11:20] but what's the difference between the
[11:21] devil's belief and in your believing
[11:24] now the devil can look at the scripture
[11:26] and say well that's true
[11:27] that's sure sure but now when you grab
[11:31] ahold of the word of god by
[11:32] faith and believe it in your heart
[11:36] and you say that's true something
[11:39] something takes place
[11:40] what takes place it actually becomes a
[11:43] life
[11:44] it actually lives so there you can see
[11:47] that the difference is
[11:49] faith makes the word live faith
[11:52] actually produces a living word a living
[11:55] reality it will make the things that you
[11:57] read about
[11:58] and it'll turn it from just like an
[11:59] education an intellectual faith
[12:01] it'll turn it into a living word a
[12:03] living reality
[12:07] and that's why it declares or it speaks
[12:09] for itself because when it becomes alive
[12:11] then it becomes it is testifying of
[12:14] itself
[12:15] it testifies it's bold brother i'm
[12:17] saying faith is something that you
[12:19] believe is there that really nothing
[12:20] else will declare it's there but faith
[12:23] nothing else will declare us there but
[12:25] faith and then he goes on to talk about
[12:27] how faith won't work without love and
[12:29] that's where you know brother
[12:30] brother wade has been preaching on
[12:31] perfect love and and
[12:33] we've been talking about adoption and
[12:35] those kind of things and
[12:36] you see how love and faith are so
[12:39] closely related
[12:41] that you've got to actually have love to
[12:43] have real
[12:44] faith and brother brown says brother
[12:47] brown says explain
[12:48] he began to explain in this message he
[12:50] was talking about how this couple when
[12:52] they first got married
[12:53] he uh they were just a young couple in
[12:55] the and the and the man
[12:57] in the story had uh he had a history of
[13:00] alcohol problem and when they got
[13:01] married
[13:02] the the little sister she said now
[13:04] listen i know that you had a
[13:06] a background of alcoholism but now
[13:08] listen i love you
[13:10] and if you if you ever stray if you ever
[13:13] go
[13:13] have a trouble with that and go back out
[13:15] into alcoholism
[13:16] and and go and and kind of mess up you
[13:19] know when i'm not around you go to work
[13:20] and i start hanging out with some people
[13:22] or whatever if you ever fall
[13:24] just remember that i love you i i love
[13:27] you and when you come back
[13:28] we'll get together and we'll pray about
[13:30] it we'll bring this situation before god
[13:33] and we'll get together
[13:34] and we'll iron this thing out now now
[13:36] think about this
[13:37] that's a lot contrary to the way a lot
[13:39] of people do in the message
[13:41] a way a lot of people approach their
[13:43] marriages and things it's not with love
[13:45] and not with confidence but with bashing
[13:47] one another over the head until
[13:49] i tell you drive one another into
[13:50] submission most of the most of the time
[13:52] we approach situations like that or
[13:54] people you see that if you if you mess
[13:57] up when you get home i'm gonna drag you
[13:59] in front of the church and you're gonna
[14:00] confess
[14:00] i'm going to drag you over this way and
[14:02] that way i'm going to knock you out or
[14:04] whatever
[14:05] but you see love love is actually you've
[14:07] got to have
[14:08] love to have confidence and see that
[14:10] brother when he went to work he told all
[14:12] of his all the people that he was
[14:13] working with
[14:14] he said how could i do anything to
[14:19] to go against the confidence that she
[14:21] has in me
[14:22] i know she loves me with a love like
[14:24] that how could i do anything
[14:26] that's the kind of love that produces
[14:28] faith and you see when you've got that
[14:30] kind of love to god then you can come
[14:32] boldly before him with confidence
[14:34] that's the kind of love that will
[14:37] produce a perfect faith
[14:38] when you come before him and you can say
[14:40] that i know that you saved me and i know
[14:42] you brought me out of sin
[14:44] and i know that you would not have died
[14:46] on the cross if you didn't love me and i
[14:47] know that the reason that you set the
[14:49] fivefold ministry is because you love me
[14:51] and
[14:51] i know all of these things and the love
[14:54] has been built up until you've got an
[14:55] actual
[14:56] love relationship going on and you have
[14:59] confidence
[15:00] because you know that you love god and
[15:02] you know that he loves you
[15:03] and it's a relationship you see that's
[15:05] what god wants you to have a
[15:07] relationship with him
[15:08] he doesn't want you to have a
[15:09] relationship built on fear and wondering
[15:12] if he's gonna
[15:13] just uh have something horrible to you
[15:15] if you slip up or
[15:16] if you mess up he wants you to love him
[15:18] that's the kind of relationship he wants
[15:20] you to have
[15:22] you see brother brown said brother brown
[15:24] said faith believes
[15:26] that god will work it out
[15:29] i don't know how he's going to do it but
[15:30] he'll do it anyway see it masters all
[15:32] circumstances and
[15:33] faith and love is relation because you
[15:36] can't have faith
[15:38] unless you got love because your faith
[15:41] is in a god who is the very essence of
[15:44] love
[15:44] faith and love works together and so
[15:47] then you can see that if you love
[15:49] god then everything will begin to work
[15:51] out
[15:52] every you begin to come to church you
[15:54] begin to do the things that you're a
[15:55] christian does because
[15:56] it's not because that you've been you
[16:00] it's because that you love god your
[16:03] brother
[16:03] said and if you love the lord just not
[16:06] trying to dodge hell
[16:08] not just trying to dodge hell but you
[16:11] love the lord then you have faith in god
[16:14] see if you love him if you love him
[16:17] really from that agapo love that brother
[16:19] wade's been bringing out agapo love that
[16:21] kind of love
[16:22] the selfless love that's willing to lay
[16:24] everything out
[16:25] you know in the beginning of this
[16:27] message brother ram talks about how
[16:28] faith really
[16:29] really true faith does for other people
[16:31] you're not so interested in them doing
[16:33] for you
[16:34] but it's something for other people and
[16:36] that's what real agapo love
[16:38] is doing el gapo love will make a
[16:40] minister
[16:41] labor for hours to try to get a message
[16:43] not even concerned about
[16:45] how much money or how much fame or what
[16:47] any of that kind of stuff all of that
[16:48] becomes irrelevant
[16:50] love will make people labor for one
[16:52] another love will make people do for one
[16:54] another
[16:55] love will make you go to the hospital
[16:56] and be with people love will make you
[16:58] get off work or whatever to help people
[17:00] love will make you
[17:01] talk to your wife or your spouse
[17:03] differently it'll make you
[17:05] lay down your selfish attitude and stuff
[17:07] and treat somebody differently
[17:09] because that's that's what agapo love is
[17:11] not filial love
[17:13] not stargate love and not definitely not
[17:15] eros love
[17:16] but a love of god that proceeds from god
[17:19] himself
[17:20] that kind of substance faith that we're
[17:22] talking about
[17:24] yeah brother brown said now now now
[17:26] think about this now
[17:27] we think about it in the context of the
[17:29] sermons that
[17:30] have been preached talking about
[17:32] adoption talking about it coming to a
[17:34] place
[17:34] talking about uh perfect love brother
[17:37] john said now
[17:38] now he preached this sermon in front of
[17:39] a prayer line and at the end of this
[17:41] sermon he said
[17:42] y'all this didn't anchor in i don't
[17:44] think it's anchoring in what i'm really
[17:45] trying
[17:46] to express so i want to kind of expose
[17:48] that tonight i want what he was trying
[17:50] to say to anchor in
[17:52] i want you to catch the vision of what
[17:54] he was trying to say
[17:55] that they did not catch back then and
[17:58] brother brown said now we want to speak
[18:00] now
[18:00] upon faith and a different type of faith
[18:04] a different type of faith perfect faith
[18:08] and he said that's a great thing
[18:12] now maybe maybe later on you can go back
[18:13] and listen to this message it's only
[18:15] just a little bit over an hour so it
[18:16] won't take that long
[18:18] go back and listen and meditate on these
[18:20] things that he says
[18:21] as he says it like this now we want to
[18:23] speak now upon faith in a different type
[18:25] of faith
[18:26] a different type of faith and he says
[18:28] we're i'm trying to get the church
[18:31] into the place to where we could really
[18:34] see
[18:34] apostolic times moving among us now
[18:37] what's it going to take to see apostolic
[18:39] times moving
[18:40] among among the church it's going to
[18:42] take
[18:43] a malachi 4 to actually literally turn
[18:47] the hearts of the children back to the
[18:49] original
[18:50] faith of the fathers actually restore
[18:52] them back
[18:53] to open up to preach the revelation of
[18:56] the seven seals
[18:57] and those mystery truths would literally
[19:00] turn your heart
[19:01] back and cause you to come to a position
[19:04] of perfect faith realizing what you're
[19:07] doing and whom you have believed
[19:09] and positionally placed you so that you
[19:11] can believe
[19:12] the right way now brother branham said
[19:14] listen now he says that he says
[19:16] and it's just laying right at the door
[19:20] we see it but we want to see more of it
[19:24] we see it but we want to see more of it
[19:26] we want it
[19:27] such a flow that it'll be a help to us
[19:30] to flow
[19:31] out to others to flow out to others what
[19:35] about the flow
[19:36] flow back to me to flow out to others
[19:39] because
[19:39] real faith goes out to others you see
[19:42] real faith
[19:43] is where you can help others and do
[19:44] something for others and do something
[19:46] for the kingdom of god and do something
[19:47] for god
[19:50] you see
[19:54] see what stumbles people is that when
[19:55] you say perfect faith
[19:57] you begin in your mind you begin to
[19:59] think well i can never
[20:00] i could never approach to perfection i
[20:02] could never approach to this kind of
[20:04] faith
[20:05] the same thing with the capstone the
[20:06] same thing with the token all these
[20:08] things
[20:08] these great doctrines it seems like so
[20:12] so far off i want to get it down to your
[20:14] level a little bit that it is
[20:16] possible and that is actually the reason
[20:18] why the message was given so that you
[20:20] could have perfect faith
[20:22] the reason why the message was given so
[20:25] that so the little child
[20:26] could have perfect faith i was thinking
[20:28] this morning about
[20:30] about peter that a man sitting there
[20:32] with
[20:33] with no education that could not read or
[20:35] write
[20:36] maybe he could a little bit he couldn't
[20:38] he couldn't read
[20:39] and yet he preached he talked about
[20:42] the stature of a perfect man now see see
[20:45] it's open to anybody that can receive if
[20:47] you'll just open up the door of your
[20:49] heart
[20:49] and let the word come in the word will
[20:51] actually position you
[20:53] position you and place you in a way that
[20:55] you can begin to take hold of god's word
[20:57] and recognize what you're doing here
[20:59] recognize what has got what god has done
[21:02] in your life
[21:02] and you can actually believe in the way
[21:04] that god wants you to
[21:06] believe in the way that the word
[21:08] actually begins to come out of your own
[21:10] mouth
[21:10] and you begin to speak the things that
[21:12] are in the scripture
[21:14] so that when you pray you're not praying
[21:16] like a little baby anymore but you're
[21:17] praying
[21:18] standing in faith believing in the god
[21:21] that you serve
[21:22] that he's he loves you and he's there
[21:24] for you and he's watching over you he's
[21:26] watched over you your whole life
[21:28] and he's there to make his word come to
[21:30] pass in you
[21:32] now now now let's just go through
[21:34] perfection just briefly let's read some
[21:36] scriptures
[21:36] now in hebrews chapter 6 verse 1 to 2 it
[21:39] says therefore
[21:40] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[21:42] of christ
[21:44] let us go on unto perfection to
[21:46] perfection
[21:47] perfection now not laying again the
[21:50] foundation of repentance from dead works
[21:52] and of faith toward god or the doctrine
[21:53] of baptisms and of laying on of hands
[21:55] and of resurrection of the dead and of
[21:57] eternal judgment
[21:58] all of those things are good and we know
[22:00] we've been taught that we go beyond
[22:02] we've got to keep going on like where
[22:04] where did pentecost fail by stopping you
[22:06] don't go you don't stop you keep moving
[22:08] on
[22:08] because we're moving on towards
[22:10] something
[22:12] in second corinthians chapter 13 verse 9
[22:15] paul said for we are glad when we are
[22:18] weak and ye are strong
[22:19] and this also we wish even your
[22:23] perfection
[22:24] not that you would be little babies
[22:26] tossed around around by every window
[22:28] doctrine but that you would be perfected
[22:31] in luke chapter eight now here's a very
[22:34] strange one
[22:34] maybe we hadn't come across before
[22:36] here's a real strange one
[22:38] and this is the parable of the see the
[22:39] sower of the seed i'm gonna read it for
[22:41] you and just call out some things
[22:43] because jesus said now the parable is
[22:45] this the seed is the word of god we know
[22:47] the parable about how the
[22:49] the the sower goes forth and and a lot
[22:51] of the seed gets choked out and
[22:53] different kind of things
[22:54] things happen so it can't grow and and
[22:57] jesus is explaining it and he says those
[22:59] by the wayside are they to hear then
[23:01] cometh the devil and taketh away the
[23:02] word out of their hearts lest they
[23:04] should believe and be saved
[23:05] they on the rock are they which when
[23:07] they hear receive the word with joy and
[23:09] these have no root for
[23:10] which for a while believe and in time of
[23:12] temptation fall away
[23:14] and that which fell among thorns
[23:17] are they which when they have heard go
[23:19] forth and are choked
[23:20] with cares and riches and pleasures of
[23:24] this life that kind of sounds like
[23:25] layout of sea a little bit doesn't it
[23:27] joked up with the cares and the riches
[23:29] of the pleasure this is life
[23:30] too much time to watch netflix and too
[23:32] much time to get on instagram than to
[23:34] actually get into the message
[23:35] and bring no fruit to
[23:38] perfection to perfection but that on the
[23:42] good ground are they which in an honest
[23:44] and good heart having heard the word
[23:46] keep it
[23:46] and bring forth fruit with patience
[23:50] bring forth fruit so when you see the
[23:52] fruit being
[23:53] born and it matches the same thing that
[23:56] went into the ground then you've got
[23:58] perfection back again
[24:02] i'm just kind of laying this out brother
[24:04] brahma said in perfect faith in this
[24:05] message he says now you see
[24:07] somebody else do something by a word act
[24:10] of god
[24:11] or promise of god and many of them say i
[24:14] can do that too now
[24:15] i'm tying this in with a scripture that
[24:17] i just read about the fruit
[24:19] not coming to perfection now listen what
[24:21] he says i can do that too
[24:23] it's an imagination and when they do you
[24:26] find them
[24:26] wrecked up out there somewhere it's got
[24:28] to be a substance
[24:30] now that is potentially a faith that is
[24:33] something that would bring you to a
[24:34] faith
[24:35] it's potentially like if you'd asked me
[24:37] for an oak tree and i give you an acorn
[24:39] potentially you have an oak tree but it
[24:42] hasn't produced itself yet
[24:44] but when it really brings itself out it
[24:46] is an
[24:47] oak tree and when you imagine that god
[24:50] does this but when it's revealed to you
[24:52] it's a faith then a perfect faith that
[24:55] cannot fail
[24:57] and i believe that brother branham
[24:58] preaches in different levels now
[25:00] one hand he's saying yeah you you start
[25:02] off at justification but wait till it
[25:04] comes out of the ground wait till it
[25:05] comes on out
[25:06] then you got perfect faith there in your
[25:08] soul but
[25:09] what about what about after you've been
[25:11] born again then let that
[25:13] let what has been planted continue to
[25:15] mature
[25:16] as the word has matured down through
[25:18] martin luther and john wesley and
[25:20] pentecost and now
[25:21] is coming out coming out to the
[25:23] headstone coming out to a place where
[25:25] now you can see the original fruit that
[25:27] was planted
[25:28] the original grain of wheat coming forth
[25:30] so what is perfection what perfection
[25:32] are we talking about we're talking about
[25:33] a perfect faith
[25:35] a mature faith a fruitful faith
[25:38] of faith where there's no leaven anymore
[25:41] no leaven nothing mixed in it no
[25:43] hybridization
[25:44] no doubt no it's back to the original
[25:48] again because brother branham said that
[25:49] you got to have perfect
[25:51] faith for a rapture in this message he
[25:53] said
[25:54] perfect faith came for for a perfect
[25:56] rapture
[25:58] perfect faith now think about that
[25:59] perfect faith a perfect faith
[26:02] is given to a perfect bride to take a
[26:05] perfect rapture see how perfect that is
[26:08] you've heard a perfect message and that
[26:10] perfect message was given so that you
[26:12] could have a perfect faith
[26:15] you see it's something that you have
[26:17] something that you've already got when
[26:19] you became a born-again believer growing
[26:21] into manifestation growing into reality
[26:24] and that's why sometimes it's so
[26:25] confusing to listen to the way that he's
[26:27] wording it
[26:28] because it seems like you've got it and
[26:30] then it's far off it seems like when you
[26:32] listen to the statue of a perfect man
[26:34] you've got it you've got you're born
[26:35] again but yet you've come all this way
[26:37] and you don't have the holy ghost yet
[26:38] you've got it but there's something else
[26:40] you got it but it's growing in the
[26:42] maturity
[26:42] and when it grows into maturity then you
[26:44] come to a place
[26:46] where it's mature and there's no doubt
[26:48] and you come to speaking conditions the
[26:52] gospel message the message
[26:53] is actually getting us in position for
[26:57] perfect faith and you know i think this
[26:59] is i i know many times many preachers
[27:01] have preached on how
[27:02] we we keep pushing it off and pushing it
[27:04] off but now
[27:06] i believe it's time to get into the
[27:07] message and realize that it's a present
[27:10] tense reality
[27:11] that the things that brother branham
[27:12] talked about now are accessible to you
[27:15] and i
[27:15] the things that so many people have
[27:17] probed now are
[27:18] like he said it's right at the door it's
[27:21] right at the door if you can just
[27:23] just take some time and get in there and
[27:25] hunt for the treasure
[27:26] hunt for the little bits of gold and the
[27:28] nuggets and and when you come out you'll
[27:30] say
[27:31] this is something that i found that will
[27:33] give me faith
[27:35] this is the thing that i needed to
[27:37] overcome what i'm going through this
[27:39] is the thing that i needed to take me to
[27:40] the next level
[27:42] that's what the message is doing to you
[27:44] now
[27:46] brother brown said in the message
[27:47] adoption back in 1960 he said
[27:49] now listen how he says talks about
[27:51] positionally positionally placing you
[27:54] bible teaching is usually a little
[27:56] treacherous a little you know kind of
[27:57] walking out on the thin ice we call it
[27:59] but we just feel that maybe at this
[28:01] point
[28:02] and at this time it might be good to
[28:04] kind of bring the church to what i think
[28:06] a complete understanding
[28:08] positionally of what we are in christ
[28:11] jesus now as we as we'll go along in
[28:14] this message you'll begin to understand
[28:16] why it's so important for you to begin
[28:18] to realize
[28:19] who you are because who you are and who
[28:22] god is and the relationship the love
[28:24] relationship that you have because that
[28:26] is actually what
[28:27] positionally brings you to a place of
[28:29] perfect faith
[28:31] is knowing who you are what i think a
[28:34] complete understanding positionally of
[28:36] what we are in christ jesus
[28:37] and sometimes i think that preaching is
[28:39] a wonderful thing but i believe
[28:41] sometimes
[28:41] brother beeler that teaching goes beyond
[28:43] that especially to the church
[28:45] preaching usually catches the sinner
[28:47] brings him under condemnation by the
[28:49] word but teaching places of man
[28:51] positionally what he is and see that's
[28:54] how you're going to have perfect faith
[28:56] is by understanding through the teaching
[28:59] through the preaching of the word
[29:00] what you are and we can now listen i got
[29:03] this bold and
[29:04] real big in my notes here we can never
[29:07] rightly
[29:08] be able to have faith
[29:11] until positionally we know
[29:14] what we are so
[29:18] if you want to have perfect faith this
[29:21] kind of mature faith that i'm talking
[29:23] about
[29:23] you've got to know who you are and
[29:26] you've got to understand who you are
[29:29] you've got to believe who you are of
[29:31] course that only comes by
[29:33] getting in the word now brother branham
[29:35] he began to talk about how faith
[29:37] faith versus science faith faith does
[29:39] not care about what you see
[29:41] it does not care about circumstances
[29:43] faith
[29:44] faith just looks to the unseen faith
[29:47] sees what the senses cannot
[29:49] brethren says now faith he that cometh
[29:50] to god must believe that he is
[29:52] and it's impossible to please god
[29:54] without faith you cannot please him and
[29:57] if you say you believe
[29:58] god you have never seen him see so then
[30:01] you've got to believe it by faith
[30:04] and if you could see him it would be no
[30:07] more
[30:07] faith anything that the census declares
[30:11] is no more
[30:12] faith it's a scientific fact now you say
[30:14] you might begin to think well i wish
[30:16] that i could see him i wish that i could
[30:17] see him right here but
[30:19] your faith is so much higher than your
[30:21] your natural senses
[30:23] that when you see him by faith it's
[30:25] greater than if you could see him
[30:27] sitting there in the chair
[30:29] sitting there in a pew because if you
[30:31] see him with the inward eye
[30:33] then you it's actually him inside of you
[30:36] that allows you to see
[30:38] and it's greater than that because on
[30:40] the inside you're not looking at things
[30:42] that you see anymore
[30:44] you're looking like peter when jesus
[30:46] called in to walk on the water and he
[30:47] stepped out
[30:48] on something that he could not see and
[30:50] he ignored all the things that he could
[30:53] see
[30:53] like abraham who ignored the
[30:55] circumstances to ignore
[30:57] how old he was and instead of looking at
[30:59] how old he was in the circumstances
[31:01] looked straight into the face of god's
[31:04] promises and claimed it
[31:06] anything that the census declares is no
[31:08] more faith
[31:09] it's a scientific fact it's got no more
[31:11] faith so faith
[31:12] faith is only concerned with looking at
[31:16] god's word
[31:18] but said you have to accept him by faith
[31:20] and he that cometh to god must believe
[31:22] god and faith comes by hearing the word
[31:24] of god see
[31:26] you must first believe this is god's
[31:28] word
[31:29] and you must come to god by the word see
[31:32] just take the word what it says and
[31:35] that's right
[31:37] now see we're coming to a place he's
[31:39] establishing what it takes to have
[31:41] perfect faith
[31:42] when you can look at god's word and
[31:44] accept it and say i believe that that's
[31:45] true
[31:46] i know that it's true i know that i
[31:48] believe that
[31:49] then it begins to build your faith
[31:52] actually when you begin to sit in a cir
[31:53] in a service like this and his service
[31:56] actually as the preaching of the gospel
[31:57] goes over the pulpit
[31:58] your faith begins to rise if you really
[32:01] open the door of your heart and you
[32:02] listen
[32:02] and through the service your faith is
[32:04] building and building and building
[32:06] just like it was in this service as
[32:08] brother branham preached he said i'm
[32:09] trying to build your faith
[32:11] and at the end of the service they had a
[32:12] prayer line why at the end of the
[32:14] service and not the beginning
[32:15] because as they had heard the word their
[32:17] faith was built and built to a place
[32:20] until they began to believe god and
[32:21] brother i said you must come with an
[32:23] unfailing faith believing that god made
[32:26] the promise
[32:27] but now you have to be in a position
[32:31] to have that faith you got to be in a
[32:34] position to have that faith
[32:36] that's what the word does is it places
[32:38] you it puts you right there in that
[32:39] position
[32:40] where you can grab a hold to it and
[32:43] that's why brother brown said and that's
[32:44] what we're going to talk on see
[32:46] to receive that faith
[32:52] and then he goes on he talks about how
[32:53] in hebrews 11. it says now faith is the
[32:55] substance of things hoped for it's not
[32:57] what you imagine
[32:59] not something that you can just you
[33:00] you're just hoping for or something
[33:02] it's just as real to you as any sense of
[33:05] your body will declare anything else
[33:07] it's just as real as to say i feel my
[33:10] coat
[33:10] it's just as real as i hear that baby
[33:13] talking and i'm talking about faith now
[33:15] i'm talking about when you get a real
[33:17] revelation and you know that god has
[33:19] opened your eyes on the inside
[33:21] open up your faith eye then you it's as
[33:25] real to you as this pulpit it's as real
[33:28] as the carpet it's as real as the pew
[33:30] you're standing on and brother adam said
[33:32] if you've got real faith
[33:33] and you go to the doctor and he says
[33:34] you've got cancer you'll laugh at the
[33:36] doctor
[33:37] because you've got something that's
[33:39] greater than anything that the doctor
[33:40] can say
[33:41] it's just as real as i hear that baby
[33:43] talking there or making this noise
[33:45] see just that real is music playing it's
[33:48] real
[33:49] because it's based upon something real
[33:52] not
[33:52] based upon the sinking sands of man's
[33:55] theology or a man's imagination or
[33:57] something maybe some kind of
[33:59] supernatural thing that maybe
[34:00] god allowed you to see at one time but
[34:02] it's based upon the rock of the
[34:04] revelation of god's word
[34:06] the revelation of who he is it's not
[34:08] upon what you can or can't
[34:10] can or cannot see or feel like i like
[34:13] somebody
[34:14] we were talking to some young people one
[34:15] time and somebody said well i you know i
[34:17] don't believe that
[34:18] a minister has a right to get up and
[34:19] preach behind the pulpit unless he
[34:21] sees something supernatural first now
[34:24] see then you got to go back and compare
[34:25] it with the word
[34:26] what's greater to be able to see the
[34:28] pillar of fire or something or to see an
[34:30] angel walk down the aisle
[34:31] or to actually have a revelation of
[34:33] god's word a revelation that gives you
[34:35] that kind of substance faith that you
[34:38] know what you're standing on
[34:40] and see then your house is not like that
[34:42] parable that jesus taught then your
[34:43] house is not built upon a sinking sand
[34:46] now i hate to say it but that's what
[34:48] many people today have done
[34:49] is they've allowed their their spiritual
[34:52] condition to be built upon a sinking
[34:54] sand
[34:54] of creeds or ideas or just their their
[34:57] laziness that they never went on with
[34:59] the gospel and they never went on
[35:01] they never were encouraged enough within
[35:03] themself to go and find out what the
[35:05] message was about
[35:06] and then they find out that they built
[35:08] everything on a sinking sand that
[35:09] crumbles at the end of the road
[35:11] but brother brown said that if you built
[35:13] if your revelation if your spiritual
[35:15] experience is built upon the rock of
[35:17] revelation it will never
[35:19] fail it can never be taken away from you
[35:22] and it's built what's perfect faith
[35:24] based on if faith is based upon
[35:27] god's word amen now y'all hang on with
[35:30] me i know some
[35:31] some of y'all i know y'all are like this
[35:33] is this is real basic
[35:34] why is he covering all this come on now
[35:36] we're we're getting somewhere
[35:40] y'all ain't intimidating me
[35:41] [Laughter]
[35:43] your faith your faith is in god's word
[35:46] brother brahma said it's a substance not
[35:48] an imagination not an emotion but
[35:50] something that you have and it comes to
[35:52] you by hearing the word of god
[35:55] the word of god and that only that only
[35:58] now
[35:59] now that means that means that you're
[36:01] not saved because of a certain minister
[36:04] you're not saved because of a certain
[36:06] man or even the certain
[36:08] church that you go to because those
[36:10] things could be taken away
[36:11] all that could be taken away but if
[36:13] you're if you're
[36:14] if you know and you recognize that
[36:17] you're saved
[36:18] the reason that you're here tonight is
[36:20] because god has done something in your
[36:22] life
[36:22] you'll never be able to remove that
[36:25] brother brahman said
[36:26] that puts it back to where your faith in
[36:28] is not in some individual
[36:30] it's not in a man it's not in an
[36:34] organization
[36:35] it's not in a group of people it's in
[36:38] god because
[36:39] god is the word see your faith
[36:42] is in god so then you know when you get
[36:46] you get to a desperate place and you
[36:47] begin to call out to god and you have a
[36:49] love relationship with god that agapo
[36:52] love the deep calling to the deep
[36:54] then see if you're if your faith is
[36:56] based in your faith with god
[36:58] then you don't have to go call somebody
[37:00] else and wait for somebody else to do
[37:02] something you don't have to you're not
[37:03] relying on somebody else's relationship
[37:05] with god
[37:06] because you yourself have a personal
[37:09] relationship with god
[37:10] for yourself and you can stand and pray
[37:13] for yourself
[37:16] i i believe that's what every god called
[37:18] minister wants for the congregation of
[37:20] the lord
[37:21] it's for everybody to have their own
[37:23] relationship with god
[37:25] and if it's not if it's not some
[37:27] individual if it's not some man
[37:29] then that includes you you see because
[37:32] you're not saved because something that
[37:34] you did
[37:34] you're not saved because of your works
[37:40] peter peter one time he thought well i'm
[37:42] i'm real good i i
[37:44] i'm never gonna leave you lord i'm never
[37:46] i'm in matthew 26
[37:48] it says though all men should be
[37:49] offended because of the
[37:51] yet well i never be offended and he
[37:53] thought he was going to be saved because
[37:54] of how much he could just
[37:56] just work up the gumption or work up the
[37:58] courage or whatever he thought he was
[37:59] going to be able to save himself
[38:01] jesus said unto him verily i say unto
[38:03] thee that this night before the
[38:04] crew thou shalt deny me thrice
[38:08] psalm 100 says know ye that the lord he
[38:10] is god it is he that hath made us and
[38:12] not we
[38:13] ourselves we're not the ones that has
[38:15] done it
[38:16] he's the and now and y'all bear with me
[38:18] now i i'm getting to something
[38:21] that that if we have confidence that he
[38:24] is the one that has transformed us
[38:26] that we didn't stop smoking cigarettes
[38:28] or drinking alcohol or
[38:30] all of the things that we can look back
[38:32] and see that we used to do
[38:33] we didn't come out of those strange
[38:35] doctrines because of our own power
[38:37] but it's actually the lord that has
[38:39] moved us
[38:40] the lord has brought us to this place
[38:42] he's the one that has carried us this
[38:44] far
[38:45] and you see that that actually positions
[38:48] you
[38:48] to where you can have perfect faith to
[38:51] look at your
[38:52] own life and recognize that god has done
[38:55] something in you
[38:56] that god's done something for you and
[38:58] it's not something that you can point
[39:00] at a man or an organization or something
[39:03] that god has done it
[39:05] in zechariah chapter 4 it says the word
[39:08] of the lord is a ruble not
[39:10] by might nor by power but by my
[39:13] spirit saith the lord of hosts it's not
[39:15] by your doings
[39:16] it's not by your power or you're working
[39:18] something up but it's by his spirit that
[39:20] has brought you this far
[39:22] his spirit is the thing that is working
[39:24] and doing it in you
[39:26] and that's the way that the headstone is
[39:27] going to come not by your struggling and
[39:29] striving it although that's part of it
[39:31] but it's his grace that's going to come
[39:33] to the church it's
[39:34] grace grace and she shall bring forth a
[39:37] headstone thereof with shout is crying
[39:39] grace
[39:40] grace unto it it's his grace to you
[39:42] that's brought it
[39:44] so then you can say we're going to say
[39:47] goodbye to all the complexes that have
[39:49] come by looking at man
[39:50] and looking at yourself goodbye all the
[39:53] things that where you say well i'm not
[39:54] smart enough that i'm not good enough
[39:56] and i'm not smart enough
[39:58] he's the one that made the way he's the
[40:01] one that's
[40:02] died on the cross so that you could come
[40:03] to him
[40:04] [Applause]
[40:05] you say i'm not pretty enough girls and
[40:08] i'm not a smart enough guys and i'm not
[40:10] strong enough i'm not this enough
[40:12] he's the word says that we are more than
[40:15] conquerors through him that loved us
[40:17] so when you begin to look back at his
[40:19] word instead of a man instead of your
[40:21] own self instead of an organization then
[40:24] you can begin to have
[40:25] perfect faith
[40:29] many times we look at our own lives and
[40:30] look back at the things we used to do
[40:32] and say
[40:32] well i i've got all these transgressions
[40:34] how can i ever pay for it
[40:36] i'll never be able to pay for my
[40:38] transgressions but his word
[40:40] says that it's already paid for it's
[40:43] already paid for
[40:45] and so perfect faith looks to him it
[40:48] looks to the things that you cannot see
[40:50] it looks to the it looks to what god has
[40:52] already accomplished in his word
[40:56] brother brown said i love this quote in
[40:58] 1954 he said therefore jesus didn't make
[41:00] a mistake when he said
[41:02] be therefore perfect even as your father
[41:05] in heaven is perfect
[41:06] and how could a human being be perfect
[41:09] how can you be perfect
[41:10] in your own self i hope we just squash
[41:13] that
[41:14] it's not in your own self how could a
[41:15] human being be perfect
[41:17] he could be perfect by his perfect faith
[41:21] resting in him saying he paid the price
[41:24] for me
[41:25] and that's how you could be perfect by
[41:26] perfect faith in him
[41:28] perfect faith in that perfect one and
[41:31] brother
[41:31] said and he promised it and his word and
[41:33] here he comes and promised it for this
[41:35] day therefore
[41:36] you know where you're standing
[41:39] when he said so see there you enter into
[41:42] a position
[41:43] you're entering into a position for
[41:45] perfect faith when you can look at god's
[41:47] word and know that he said so
[41:49] he said see that gives me a faith
[41:50] because he never does nothing contrary
[41:52] to his written word
[41:54] and if it was contrary to the word i
[41:55] couldn't have faith in it brings it
[41:57] right back again to the word see faith
[41:59] in hearing the word of god
[42:01] you must hear the word of god god's word
[42:04] is that
[42:04] all-sufficient word it's all you have
[42:07] need of
[42:07] is this word and see now now you're
[42:10] coming
[42:10] when you've heard the word and it's
[42:12] built up within you and it's built up
[42:14] now you're coming into position for a
[42:17] perfect faith
[42:18] and brother abraham said i want you to
[42:19] get this now
[42:21] the church has got to lift itself in the
[42:24] power of god
[42:26] the church has got to lift itself in the
[42:28] power of god he said how we are too
[42:30] close to the end now
[42:31] and i believe the church is in condition
[42:33] where we can teach it a little deeper
[42:34] things
[42:35] and rub some of this make-believe out
[42:38] and get into something real
[42:40] get into something real where you begin
[42:42] to realize that
[42:44] jesus was right when he said that all
[42:46] things all
[42:47] things are possible to them that believe
[42:50] all
[42:50] things means all things that means that
[42:53] your family can be saved
[42:55] that means that that disease that you've
[42:56] been struggling with all these years
[42:58] that it's not too late the devil might
[43:00] be telling you that you've been
[43:01] suffering with that too long but all
[43:03] things
[43:03] are possible to them that believe all
[43:06] things
[43:07] and and it's true where jesus said in
[43:10] matthew 21
[43:11] verily i say unto you if you have faith
[43:13] and doubt not ye shall not only do this
[43:16] which is done to the fig tree
[43:17] but also if you shall say unto this
[43:19] mountain be thou removed
[43:21] and be thou cast into the sea it shall
[43:24] be done
[43:25] if you believe that all things are
[43:27] possible then that's possible too
[43:29] if you believe the word and the word is
[43:32] in you and you've been identified with
[43:33] the word
[43:34] then you have a right to speak the word
[43:37] you can speak the word and you have that
[43:39] privilege
[43:40] you have that privilege because the veil
[43:42] of the shook has been
[43:43] pulled back from your eyes and now
[43:46] you're coming to a position of faith
[43:48] where you know what you have access to
[43:51] when the shock is over your eyes you
[43:52] don't know what you have access to
[43:54] but when it's pulled back then you can
[43:56] see clearly you can see
[43:59] what you've got access to because now
[44:01] the grain is made bare
[44:03] you can see your eyes that's why brother
[44:06] brown told that story about his mama
[44:08] would rub that kungry saw over him
[44:10] the kung grease is the message of the
[44:12] hour that has been applied to our eyes
[44:15] to take away that shook veil and reveal
[44:17] to us
[44:18] the promises of god that we have access
[44:20] to the promises
[44:22] like all things are possible to them
[44:24] that believe
[44:25] and we are believers are we not we
[44:27] believe in the good times
[44:29] we believe in the bad times we believe
[44:31] when things are going right
[44:32] we believe because we are believers we
[44:35] believe in god we believe
[44:37] we know what we believe in now brother
[44:39] brown said in spiritual food and due
[44:41] season he said i want you
[44:42] i want you to get built up now i want
[44:46] you to get built up in the
[44:47] holy oracles of god in the faith
[44:50] the faith of this hour what's the faith
[44:53] of this hour a perfect faith
[44:55] a perfect faith where you know that all
[44:59] things are possible the the faith
[45:03] it's going to take more faith than ever
[45:05] was at any age
[45:06] for this has to be rapturing faith be
[45:09] taken up that's why i believe the
[45:11] message of the hour
[45:13] is building up your faith it's building
[45:15] up
[45:16] not tearing down maybe there was a time
[45:18] long ago when it was time to tear people
[45:20] down
[45:20] but now the message is building people
[45:23] up it's building you up
[45:24] so that you begin to realize who you are
[45:28] built up like like who built up like how
[45:30] zerubbabel
[45:31] cleaned off the foundation and began to
[45:33] build up the tabernacle
[45:35] build it up so that when it was built up
[45:38] again the presence of god could come in
[45:40] and
[45:40] build up like elijah when he cleared off
[45:43] the stones and he began to
[45:44] peel up the stones like brother wade was
[45:46] preaching on last sunday and when he
[45:48] build it up
[45:49] they he stood with confidence and began
[45:51] to call on the name of the lord and
[45:53] identified
[45:54] who who they were not jacob but israel
[45:57] he said you're the god of israel
[45:59] he knew who he was he identified the
[46:02] church
[46:02] with the god that they served this is
[46:05] israel
[46:05] and he and then the fire field when he
[46:08] built
[46:08] up what had been torn down and brought
[46:11] everything back again
[46:13] to the way that it should be then then
[46:15] you see then they were positioned
[46:17] for perfect faith and that's what called
[46:20] the fire to fall
[46:21] you see you need you need the word you
[46:24] got to have the word
[46:25] the word's got to be built up in you to
[46:27] have perfect faith
[46:29] and you need the holy ghost to have
[46:31] perfect faith
[46:32] you've got to have the holy ghost now
[46:33] brother said now see at first the
[46:35] disciples didn't have this perfect faith
[46:38] they didn't have it because they had
[46:39] christ walking with him but then
[46:41] afterwards
[46:42] christ was in them so you see it's hard
[46:45] then to have this perfect faith
[46:47] without the holy spirit it has to bring
[46:50] it
[46:50] the holy spirit is what brings perfect
[46:52] faith
[46:53] now you say the disciples didn't have
[46:55] perfect faith no for they had an
[46:57] epileptic child there
[46:58] that they were trying to cast this devil
[47:00] out of him
[47:01] and they couldn't do it they couldn't do
[47:03] it by their worked up intellectualism
[47:05] but when perfect faith entered in on the
[47:07] day of pentecost
[47:08] then they were able to do to do the
[47:11] things that jesus told them that they
[47:12] could do
[47:18] oh my let me see where
[47:22] see they had the word and the word was
[47:24] flesh then
[47:25] and the word told them i give you power
[47:28] you see
[47:28] you see how he's identifying power with
[47:31] the word
[47:32] amen i give you power and they had the
[47:34] power but they didn't have
[47:36] faith to operate the word that was in
[47:39] them
[47:39] see what i mean but jesus had it he was
[47:42] the word
[47:43] and he had faith that what he said would
[47:46] happen
[47:47] he had faith that what he said would
[47:50] happen
[47:51] so y'all hang on with me now we're we're
[47:53] just at the top of the hour
[47:54] he had faith now they see g brother is
[47:57] laying down something
[47:58] jesus had faith in who he was
[48:02] he had faith in the word and who he was
[48:05] now you see how
[48:06] how brother brown's building up your
[48:08] perfect faith that when you begin to
[48:10] recognize the word
[48:11] you know the word then then you begin to
[48:14] recognize
[48:15] that the word has had an effect on you
[48:17] it's accomplished something in your life
[48:20] and you begin to recognize something
[48:22] taking place in you
[48:24] and your eyes begin to open up to what
[48:26] you are
[48:28] then you begin to have perfect faith
[48:30] when you begin to see who you
[48:32] are brother said he had faith with his
[48:35] power
[48:35] how did he he said i can do nothing in
[48:38] myself
[48:39] he relied upon what he was he relied in
[48:43] knowing that he was the word
[48:45] in other words i know that god has made
[48:48] me something
[48:49] i know that i'm here for a purpose i'm
[48:51] here to die for your sins
[48:53] and that's why he said i can do nothing
[48:55] in myself now you you've got that same
[48:58] confession here tonight
[48:59] i can do nothing in myself in my flesh
[49:01] in this tabernacle that i may have
[49:03] there's no way that i can wrap i can i
[49:05] can accomplish anything in myself
[49:07] but god has it by the power of the holy
[49:09] ghost he's done something in my life
[49:12] he's changed me he's molding me in his
[49:14] image and now you see you
[49:16] begin to recognize what he has done that
[49:18] it that's him working something in you
[49:21] it begins to build up a faith in you
[49:23] that's why you know jesus
[49:25] he began to he would identify himself in
[49:27] the scripture
[49:28] that's how we know that he had perfect
[49:30] faith
[49:32] jesus said in john chapter 8 he said
[49:34] then jesus said unto them when ye have
[49:35] lifted up the son of man then shall know
[49:37] you know
[49:38] then shall you know that i am he and
[49:41] that i do nothing of myself
[49:44] but as my father hath taught me i speak
[49:46] these things
[49:48] in other words i got the word inside of
[49:50] me and i'm able to speak it
[49:52] because of who i am now come on let's
[49:54] put that in a presentation reality
[49:56] let's put that in the present tense and
[49:58] he that sent me
[49:59] is with me the father hath not
[50:02] left me alone for i do always those
[50:06] things that please him
[50:08] come on now let's bring it to a present
[50:09] tense reality somebody bride that's
[50:11] coming to a perfect faith
[50:13] that everything you do is pleasing to
[50:15] the father all the doubt is
[50:16] being cast out you're coming to a
[50:18] position where you know who you are
[50:20] just like jesus knew who he was in john
[50:23] chapter 12 it says for i have not spoken
[50:26] of myself
[50:27] but the father which sent me he gave me
[50:29] a commandment
[50:30] he gave you a commandment too he gave
[50:32] you a commission to speak and go forward
[50:34] he gave you a word to fulfill in this
[50:37] day do you believe that
[50:39] there's a purpose for you to do just
[50:40] like jesus had a purpose
[50:42] what i should say and what i should
[50:44] speak and i know that his commandment is
[50:47] life everlasting
[50:48] whatsoever i speak therefore even as the
[50:51] father said unto me
[50:53] so i speak even as the father even as
[50:57] it has been revealed to me then i i
[51:00] speak it
[51:01] that's i i i speak according to my
[51:03] revelation is what he's saying
[51:05] in isaiah chapter 2 61 he's saying the
[51:08] spirit of the lord god is upon me
[51:09] because the lord hath this is the
[51:11] scripture that jesus
[51:12] when he went there in the in the temple
[51:14] and he opened up the scroll and began to
[51:16] read
[51:17] identifying himself with the scripture
[51:19] because the lord hath anointed me to
[51:21] preach
[51:22] good tidings under the meketh sent me to
[51:24] bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim
[51:26] liberty to the captives and the opening
[51:28] of the prison to them that are brown to
[51:30] proclaim the acceptable year of the lord
[51:31] he's identifying
[51:33] himself in the scripture how do you
[51:35] identify
[51:36] yourself with the scripture when you
[51:38] read the story of abraham i go i'm going
[51:40] through the same journey when you read
[51:41] the story of rahab
[51:43] i also was protected by the blood i'm
[51:46] protected
[51:46] i'm under the blood covenant when you
[51:48] read the story of david you can pray
[51:50] like david
[51:51] david went through the same three
[51:52] journeys that abraham went through
[51:54] when you read through all these stories
[51:55] in the old testament you're reading
[51:57] about yourself because you see
[51:59] people going through the same thing that
[52:01] you went through
[52:02] you're identified with him and it
[52:04] identifies you with the word because
[52:06] when you listen to the message when you
[52:08] listen to the tapes it echoes back that
[52:11] i know that i've gone through that same
[52:13] thing that brother branham's talking
[52:14] about
[52:14] i know that i've been there i know that
[52:17] i was there
[52:18] brother branham said and he had faith in
[52:20] god who made him the word
[52:22] he was god the word and they was in him
[52:24] and that gave him faith
[52:26] because he understood his position
[52:30] he understood his position he knowed
[52:32] what he was
[52:33] because the scripture had said he was
[52:36] this
[52:37] he knew what he was now do you see the
[52:40] importance of the opening of the seven
[52:41] seals
[52:42] because the seven seals actually
[52:44] identifies to you who you are
[52:46] it gives you confidence and positions
[52:48] you where you're supposed to be
[52:50] because when the seals open up you can
[52:51] look back at your life journey
[52:53] and know where you came from you can
[52:55] look back at your roadmap
[52:57] and know what god has done to you the
[52:59] shields open up and thundering out
[53:01] thundering out not just like something
[53:03] that is
[53:04] impossible to understand but thundering
[53:06] out lived voices
[53:07] a life lived by the word is the word
[53:10] express
[53:11] and that will give you that will
[53:13] position you for
[53:14] perfect faith
[53:19] now you know the dilemma with preaching
[53:22] like this
[53:23] recognizing who you are is because
[53:26] hold on now
[53:29] hold on you got to be humble
[53:33] hold on now that was that seems like a
[53:35] paradox
[53:36] that seems like a paradox when you begin
[53:38] to talk about that uh
[53:39] and i know that stumbles a lot of the
[53:40] young people here and everything how can
[53:42] how can you all be preaching that the
[53:44] son of man is is here and
[53:45] how can you be preaching that we're god
[53:47] in flesh and all these kind of things
[53:48] how can you trip now don't trip
[53:50] don't trip but go back to the word and
[53:53] see what the word says
[53:55] don't don't get stumbled all the way i'm
[53:57] telling you something now
[53:58] if this is true it's a matter of life
[54:00] and death
[54:01] so don't get stumbled over oh don't
[54:04] don't get stumbled up by deep teaching
[54:06] but go back and find out whether it's
[54:08] true or not
[54:10] somewhere along the way there's got to
[54:12] be a fulfillment of malachi 4 5
[54:14] 6 and revelation 10 7 and all the other
[54:17] scriptures that speak of this age that
[54:19] we're living in
[54:20] about what happens in laodicea and all
[54:23] the difference here there's got to be a
[54:24] fulfillment of that
[54:25] otherwise you gotta there's there's got
[54:27] to be there's got to be
[54:30] there's got to be a seventh church age
[54:32] messenger
[54:33] there's got to be it it it's true now
[54:37] now go back and do like the brains and
[54:39] search it out
[54:41] that's all i say about that now brother
[54:44] ryan said
[54:45] in the unconditional covenant you can
[54:47] never make yourself something that
[54:48] you're not
[54:49] if you're just impersonating
[54:50] christianity no matter if you're
[54:52] preaching the gospel you need an altar
[54:53] call in your soul
[54:55] you're just you're just impersonating
[55:00] if you're just trying to act like that
[55:01] person that's a christian you're
[55:02] miserable yourself
[55:04] knowing in your heart that you're not
[55:06] right you just feared hell and started
[55:07] off trying to be a christian god has to
[55:09] call you to be a christian
[55:11] god called abraham amen so it's god
[55:14] that that it in luke chapter 14 and
[55:18] verse 11 it says for whosoever exalteth
[55:20] himself shall be abased
[55:21] and he that umbleth himself shall be
[55:23] exhausted in first peter 5
[55:25] 5-6 it says likewise you younger submit
[55:27] yourselves younger under the elder
[55:29] the whole the whole christian experience
[55:31] is about submission
[55:32] and and brother we talked so many times
[55:35] about the way up is down if you want to
[55:37] go up get down
[55:38] see how low you can get not not how
[55:41] exalted you can get not where you can
[55:43] place yourself at the feet the first
[55:44] place of the feast
[55:45] but see how see how low you can get
[55:48] because god is the one that does the
[55:50] promoting
[55:51] god is the one that promote and what's
[55:53] he looking to promote he's looking to
[55:54] promote
[55:55] character and you cannot promote
[55:57] yourself many times we want to promote
[55:59] our family and ourselves
[56:01] we want to promote our kids and get our
[56:03] kids up there and promote them
[56:05] imagine if that was how uh the fivefold
[56:08] ministry was called
[56:09] the five full ministry was called by i
[56:11] want to do it but you see god is the one
[56:13] that promotes by character
[56:15] he's looking for character the same way
[56:17] that he chose david he chose david
[56:19] because of what he saw in his heart
[56:20] and he put him up there as king god is
[56:23] the one that promotes and so you can't
[56:24] you can't get high
[56:26] by promoting yourself you've got to let
[56:28] god do the promoting you can't elevate
[56:30] yourself
[56:31] you can't put yourself up there like
[56:33] that parable that said wait
[56:34] wait until you're called to the high
[56:36] place at the wedding feast
[56:38] don't put yourself up there but wait
[56:40] until somebody else
[56:41] puts you up there that's a lesson in all
[56:43] aspects of life
[56:44] you'll get embarrassed if you try to put
[56:46] yourself up there you'll get embarrassed
[56:48] many times because
[56:49] it won't work right it won't work the
[56:50] way that you think because you haven't
[56:52] waited for the word to position you
[56:54] and put you where god wants you instead
[56:57] you're trying to put yourself where you
[56:58] think that you should be but if you
[57:00] wait and let god let the spirit put you
[57:02] let
[57:03] god promote you then everything will
[57:04] work out
[57:06] god let god do the positioning brother
[57:09] said therefore he relied upon what god
[57:11] had made in him
[57:12] and if he did that then can't we rely
[57:15] upon what god made us
[57:17] as believers these signs shall follow
[57:20] them that believe
[57:20] he had faith in what he was and if you
[57:24] are a believer you have faith in what
[57:27] you
[57:28] are you are a believer amen
[57:31] and you're a believer not because you
[57:33] put yourself in that situation but the
[57:35] holy spirit
[57:36] working in you put you and placed you
[57:38] the holy ghost is what made you
[57:40] what you are today and i want to say if
[57:44] you're not a believer
[57:45] this is where believers are made
[57:49] if you're not a believer right now then
[57:51] you've come to the right place
[57:53] if you want to enter into the entered
[57:54] into the the the circle of fellowship
[57:57] that come as jesus said to peter on the
[57:59] boat come
[58:00] come and eat freely the spirit of the
[58:02] bride can't say come
[58:06] now
[58:10] let me see where we can go from here
[58:14] because brother brown he begins to go on
[58:16] about how when you look at your inward
[58:18] to your heart
[58:18] at the situation of your heart and you
[58:21] know that something's wrong you cannot
[58:23] have confidence
[58:24] see trying to get positioned for perfect
[58:26] faith
[58:27] that's why first john 3 chapter 3 verse
[58:29] 18 says my little children let us
[58:32] not love and word neither in tongue but
[58:34] indeed in truth
[58:35] and hereby we know that we are of the
[58:37] truth and
[58:38] shall assure our hearts before him for
[58:41] if our heart condemn
[58:42] us god is greater than our heart and
[58:45] knoweth all things
[58:46] beloved if our heart condemn us not then
[58:49] we have we
[58:49] confidence toward god so if you come
[58:52] before god and you're praying and
[58:54] something's
[58:55] you know something's not right you're
[58:56] sitting here in this in this
[58:58] sanctuary this afternoon and you know
[59:00] that you're not right with god
[59:02] then it's time to get that out get that
[59:04] taken care of
[59:05] seek forgiveness from those you've
[59:07] offended go back and patch things up in
[59:09] your life that
[59:10] that aren't right and you're not if
[59:12] you're not living right get everything
[59:13] straightened out
[59:14] because that's the only way that you can
[59:16] have confidence with god
[59:18] if you're a backslidden christian
[59:19] tonight and and something's not right in
[59:21] your life
[59:22] the only way you're going to have
[59:23] confidence from with god is to circle
[59:25] back around and get everything
[59:27] straightened up
[59:28] and line back up brother and said if
[59:29] there's condemnation in your life
[59:31] straighten that first see
[59:33] if you got condemnation or you might
[59:35] have oral robbers and a dozen more
[59:37] people who has faith to come in and pray
[59:39] over you and jump up and down and pour
[59:40] oil on you by the gallons
[59:42] it still won't move it still won't move
[59:44] if there's something down in your heart
[59:46] that prevents you from having confidence
[59:48] from god
[59:50] as long as you're doing things that's
[59:52] wrong you can't have confidence
[59:54] with god you'll automatically know that
[59:55] you're wrong you automatically
[59:57] put yourself back there a sinner by
[1:00:00] knowing that you're wrong
[1:00:01] but when your heart don't condemn you
[1:00:03] and you know you are a believer
[1:00:05] and there's nothing between you and god
[1:00:07] you can ask what you will
[1:00:09] and know that it will be given because
[1:00:11] that's the word
[1:00:13] that's given to you just like it was to
[1:00:15] those disciples
[1:00:17] and brother said now the only thing you
[1:00:19] have to do then
[1:00:21] now this is a word that's so strange now
[1:00:22] listen this
[1:00:24] is have faith in what you
[1:00:28] are right you see how strangely worded
[1:00:30] that is you would think he would say
[1:00:32] have faith
[1:00:33] in god and faith in in the word and all
[1:00:35] those things those have come before
[1:00:37] the word has been built up in you it's
[1:00:39] produced something in you and now
[1:00:41] you come into a position where it's time
[1:00:43] to have faith in what you are
[1:00:45] have faith in what the word says you are
[1:00:48] and jesus had faith in the word of god
[1:00:50] that said what he was
[1:00:51] it is written of me it didn't david in
[1:00:54] the psalms and the prophets and all of
[1:00:56] them speak of him i am the bread of life
[1:00:58] that come from god out of heaven
[1:00:59] i am that tree of life from the garden
[1:01:01] of eden i am all these things
[1:01:04] i am that i am and he knew with that
[1:01:06] perfect faith
[1:01:07] that he was the anointed messiah that
[1:01:10] the spirit of god was upon him he said
[1:01:12] now i and myself do nothing but it's my
[1:01:15] faith in god
[1:01:16] my faith in god and god was that it was
[1:01:19] in him the word made manifest
[1:01:21] now brother iran said the identification
[1:01:23] the identification of a scriptural
[1:01:24] christian
[1:01:25] these words said jesus these signs shall
[1:01:28] follow them that believe
[1:01:30] now see what he's doing he's saying
[1:01:32] first you have faith in god
[1:01:34] you believe his word then you recognize
[1:01:36] what god has accomplished
[1:01:38] in your life and you have faith in what
[1:01:40] you are and then you can look back
[1:01:42] and see that truly you are a christian
[1:01:44] because these signs shall follow them
[1:01:45] that believe
[1:01:46] and that is the scriptural
[1:01:48] identification of a scripture of a
[1:01:49] christian
[1:01:50] brotherhood said now how can you call
[1:01:52] yourself a believer at people and deny
[1:01:54] those words how can you call yourself a
[1:01:55] believer and deny
[1:01:56] any of this word see you can't do it see
[1:01:58] when you believe the word
[1:02:00] it will actually produce and that's what
[1:02:02] faith is
[1:02:04] faith is the word made alive faith
[1:02:07] actually brings
[1:02:08] mark 16 to life where you you can take
[1:02:11] up deadly serpents
[1:02:12] you drink deadly things all of the
[1:02:14] things that were spoken of there
[1:02:16] it's on the paper but when faith grabs a
[1:02:18] hold of that it actually produces
[1:02:20] it it makes it a living reality brother
[1:02:22] brahman said you got to take the whole
[1:02:24] thing and believe it
[1:02:25] and when you truly believe not make
[1:02:26] believe but really believe
[1:02:29] then these signs follow them that
[1:02:31] believe
[1:02:32] and i am a personal witness that these
[1:02:34] signs shall follow them that believe
[1:02:36] if you live for god then signs and
[1:02:38] wonders will follow you
[1:02:40] it may may not be appropriate to say in
[1:02:42] a sermon but signs and
[1:02:44] wonders will follow you i i'm not going
[1:02:46] to list out all the things that i've
[1:02:47] seen in my own life but
[1:02:49] i can i can definitely tell you see you
[1:02:51] see
[1:02:52] people that people that say well i don't
[1:02:53] see god doing anything
[1:02:56] you see what he's saying there look at
[1:02:58] your own life
[1:03:00] i i i believed that for so many years
[1:03:03] and and i it's like i i'm seeing this
[1:03:05] for a new time
[1:03:06] seeing this afresh that brother branham
[1:03:08] said if you say that you don't see
[1:03:11] god doing anything in this church and
[1:03:13] the bride and all these things
[1:03:15] it's because that something is wrong
[1:03:17] with your own life
[1:03:18] it's time to begin inspecting your own
[1:03:21] life and seeing if you
[1:03:22] can identify your own life with the
[1:03:24] scripture and if you can't
[1:03:26] maybe it's because that you're not
[1:03:28] believing correctly because brother
[1:03:29] branham taught us that if you believe
[1:03:31] the word correctly
[1:03:32] it will have an effect it will produce
[1:03:35] something it will produce
[1:03:37] signs and wonders what kinds of signs
[1:03:39] and wonders well the sick will be healed
[1:03:41] the lame will walk the blind will see
[1:03:44] you'll get a revelation the word will be
[1:03:46] opened up to you and beyond that
[1:03:48] the light the word will be made alive to
[1:03:50] you it will become a living reality
[1:03:52] where you'll be you'll see something
[1:03:54] because you will have a personal
[1:03:56] relationship with god
[1:03:57] a love an agapo love relationship you
[1:03:59] and god alone
[1:04:01] well the brain said oh could you compare
[1:04:03] a christian today with them christians
[1:04:05] of long ago
[1:04:06] how them disciples walked in the power
[1:04:08] of the spirit moved by the holy ghost
[1:04:10] the holy ghost would say do it and they
[1:04:13] would do it
[1:04:14] a prisoner to the word and will of god
[1:04:17] he couldn't even move until god moved
[1:04:18] him
[1:04:19] and he said wouldn't you like to see a
[1:04:21] church rise like that
[1:04:23] it's going to going back it's got to
[1:04:26] come
[1:04:27] and he said it's on its road now i
[1:04:29] believe how was it on this road
[1:04:32] people were being born again back then
[1:04:34] people were catching a hole
[1:04:35] he said that i could count on one hand
[1:04:37] the number that caught the seven seals
[1:04:39] when he preached it
[1:04:40] but to me that means that at least one
[1:04:43] called
[1:04:43] something about what he was saying in
[1:04:45] other words it was on its road back then
[1:04:48] people were already catching a hold of
[1:04:50] what he was trying to say and being
[1:04:52] positionally placed
[1:04:54] placed into the body for perfect faith
[1:04:58] what what gives you perfect faith the
[1:05:00] word brother
[1:05:01] said before the word identified
[1:05:03] identified himself
[1:05:05] what he was and the same word identifies
[1:05:08] us
[1:05:09] in first john chapter 2 verses 3 to 5
[1:05:11] and hereby we do know that we
[1:05:14] know him if we keep his commandments
[1:05:18] see there's your identification he that
[1:05:20] saith i know him and keepeth not his
[1:05:22] commandments
[1:05:23] is a liar and the truth is not in him
[1:05:27] but whoso keepeth his word in him
[1:05:30] verily is the love of god perfected
[1:05:34] perfected hereby know we
[1:05:37] that we are in him amen if we know him
[1:05:42] and we keep his commandments in other
[1:05:44] words we're walking in his word putting
[1:05:46] one foot in front of the other
[1:05:47] walking and walking up that mountain up
[1:05:50] the statue of a perfect man allowing his
[1:05:52] word to be made manifest in us
[1:05:54] bringing just to a place where we can
[1:05:57] have perfect faith
[1:05:58] john 15 7 if you abide in me and my
[1:06:01] words abide in you
[1:06:02] you shall ask what you will and that
[1:06:04] shall be done unto you now brother iran
[1:06:06] said now see
[1:06:07] he knew who he was therefore he had
[1:06:10] faith
[1:06:11] faith could produce when he
[1:06:14] knowed what he was now if you abide in
[1:06:18] me and my word and you
[1:06:20] then you know who you are right
[1:06:24] ask what you will it'll be given to you
[1:06:28] now now come on now let's put this in
[1:06:30] the context of the sermons that we've
[1:06:31] been here
[1:06:32] put this in the context of adoption time
[1:06:35] and the capstone and the headstone the
[1:06:36] token and all these things
[1:06:38] when you know who you are if you abide
[1:06:41] in me and my word in you then you know
[1:06:43] who you are
[1:06:44] when the world is built up within you
[1:06:46] and packed in
[1:06:47] and the spirit comes and quickens then
[1:06:48] you know who you are
[1:06:53] so if this word told you something then
[1:06:56] you can have the same confidence
[1:06:58] then what's going to happen
[1:07:01] brother brown said jesus had perfect
[1:07:03] faith he had it and it come because he
[1:07:06] was the word
[1:07:06] and you become the word you become the
[1:07:09] word as you receive the word
[1:07:12] if you abide in me and my words and you
[1:07:14] my words this word abides in you then
[1:07:16] ask what you will
[1:07:17] and it'll be done for you see now you're
[1:07:20] coming
[1:07:21] into position for perfect faith
[1:07:25] and what makes it so hard to preach is
[1:07:26] when you're born again you've got
[1:07:27] perfect faith
[1:07:28] but you grow into more perfect faith and
[1:07:31] more perfect faith
[1:07:33] it's not that you don't have faith
[1:07:35] you've got faith
[1:07:36] but it continues to be built up and
[1:07:38] built up to a place
[1:07:39] to now all that doubt all that has been
[1:07:42] cast out
[1:07:43] and you come to a place where you know
[1:07:45] where you stand
[1:07:47] now now brother and i said he said and
[1:07:49] i'm closing in just a second he said to
[1:07:51] us if you abide in me
[1:07:52] and my word and you saint john here you
[1:07:54] can ask what you will
[1:07:56] it'll be done then recognize your
[1:07:59] position in this scripture as a believer
[1:08:02] recognize your position that's why i
[1:08:04] call it getting in a position for
[1:08:05] perfect faith
[1:08:07] recognize where you are see you've got
[1:08:10] to recognize your position
[1:08:12] as he recognized his position
[1:08:16] i see you reckon that you can recognize
[1:08:18] him like they did on the road on the
[1:08:19] road to emmaus and when their eyes were
[1:08:21] open they recognized that
[1:08:22] that was jesus christ they recognized
[1:08:25] who that was and
[1:08:26] you could recognize there's a man
[1:08:28] walking on the water like peter did
[1:08:30] but peter recognized when jesus said
[1:08:32] come
[1:08:33] he recognized that i can do the same
[1:08:36] things that jesus is doing and he took a
[1:08:38] step out and
[1:08:39] began to walk on the water i can do the
[1:08:42] same thing that he did he began to
[1:08:44] recognize
[1:08:45] his position brother abraham said you're
[1:08:47] a christian
[1:08:49] you have right to any redemptive
[1:08:51] blessing that jesus died for you
[1:08:54] it's all yours it's already paid for you
[1:08:57] just have to believe it
[1:08:59] now imagine it but believe it and know
[1:09:01] that it's yours
[1:09:02] and you can possess it oh that's the
[1:09:04] conquering faith
[1:09:05] no yeah the musicians can come on if we
[1:09:08] could just get into position
[1:09:10] get into position like like had it right
[1:09:13] but put us in the position of hattie
[1:09:15] right there
[1:09:15] who was in the position of saying after
[1:09:19] the prophet had shared a testimony
[1:09:21] she was in the position of saying that's
[1:09:23] nothing but the truth
[1:09:25] now you're in that same position you're
[1:09:28] in the same position of you've heard the
[1:09:30] prophet's message
[1:09:32] and you're in the position now where you
[1:09:34] can say i believe that
[1:09:36] that's nothing but the truth and then
[1:09:38] she was in the position where god
[1:09:40] gave her the right to speak whatever you
[1:09:43] say
[1:09:44] whatever you say you can have you're in
[1:09:47] that same
[1:09:48] position you're now in the position
[1:09:50] where you've heard the word preached
[1:09:52] you've heard the message of the hour
[1:09:54] and now the word is in your mouth do you
[1:09:57] know
[1:09:57] you know a lot when we when we talk
[1:09:59] about the shout the voice and the trump
[1:10:01] we like we got the shout down that the
[1:10:04] message came brother brennan brought the
[1:10:05] message but we don't

[1:10:15] it and i'm going to become it i'm going
[1:10:17] to eat it
[1:10:18] and then i will be able to prophesy
[1:10:21] again
[1:10:22] as the scripture says it's time
[1:10:25] to fulfill to realize what position we
[1:10:28] have in the word

[1:10:43] we've got we've come to a place where we
[1:10:45] can fulfill what god wants us to do and
