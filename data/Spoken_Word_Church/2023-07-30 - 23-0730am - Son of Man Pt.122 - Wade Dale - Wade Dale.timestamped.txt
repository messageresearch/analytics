[0:00] right through it my fears are drowned in
[0:05] perfect love
[0:08] you rescued me
[0:11] [Music]
[0:12] [Applause]
[0:14] I am a child
[0:21] [Music]
[0:24] [Applause]
[0:28] in perfect love
[0:32] [Music]
[0:36] [Applause]
[0:39] [Music]
[0:46] [Music]
[0:51] I am
[0:52] a child oh God
[0:56] [Music]
[1:08] [Applause]
[1:09] I'm no longer a slave to fear
[1:16] I am
[1:19] [Music]
[1:21] I'm no longer a slave to fear because I
[1:29] am a child alone
[1:35] amen leave that fear out that door
[1:40] leave that fear out there
[1:43] if we're children of God
[1:45] we should have no fear
[1:47] I was thinking in there a few minutes
[1:49] ago you know until God's finished for
[1:51] you the devil cannot even touch you
[1:55] until God's finished with you and then
[1:56] he might let you you know take a little
[1:58] you know like he did job and kind of
[2:00] pull back a little bit the anointing off
[2:02] of him you feel like you lost his Adam's
[2:05] house cat but you're not
[2:07] remember God can't unlove you
[2:09] but he lets you go through trial so you
[2:11] love him more because the problem is is
[2:13] we were born in sand shaped and iniquity
[2:15] contrary to loving God
[2:19] now we love the god of the evil age but
[2:21] we didn't love this God that we're
[2:23] talking about now we were we were
[2:25] unlovable
[2:26] right yeah so if we were unlovable we
[2:29] didn't know how to love him but now we
[2:31] do know how to love him yeah man I'm
[2:33] good to be in the house of the Lord good
[2:35] to have each and every one of you with
[2:36] us good to have everybody kind of back

[3:14] Bob just said so
[3:17] [Applause]
[3:21] I mean you you
[3:25] know that's not scary I just believe
[3:27] it's the Lord you know getting us
[3:28] getting us ready to hear something
[3:31] and getting us and getting our mind in
[3:33] the right tune that's what that's what I
[3:35] pray when we pray in the back with the
[3:37] with the song leaders and different ones

[3:42] Harmony same Harmony same channel and
[3:45] you know you've seen the same songs that

[3:49] know that we don't know what I'm going
[3:51] to preach Bob doesn't know and I don't
[3:52] know what he's going to teach on so uh
[3:54] we just see that the Lord just I think
[3:56] he confirms that even in our Even in our
[4:00] ignorance sometimes we we are we're led
[4:02] by the spirit of God Amen so I
[4:05] appreciate brother Bob and his Sunday

[5:26] praise God
[5:28] ma'am thank God
[5:32] the numbers get bigger
[5:35] but we're going to speak to you today we
[5:37] were talking about it I think Wednesday
[5:38] night a little bit
[5:40] but we're going to speak on
[5:43] one section and I may I may bring out
[5:45] the uh the old chalkboard tonight or
[5:48] this afternoon I may bring the oil dry
[5:49] race board but it's so I tried to get it
[5:52] all we haven't used it in so long I
[5:54] can't get the numbers off of it so I'm
[5:56] gonna have to find some alcohol or
[5:57] something to get them numbers off of it
[5:58] because we haven't used it in a while
[6:00] but remember we're talking today about
[6:03] your new birth
[6:05] not the Holy Spirit up here we'll get to
[6:08] that this afternoon but there's got to
[6:09] be it's the same Holy Spirit but it's
[6:11] two different sections of your journey
[6:14] all right just like an anointing is a
[6:17] section of your journey uh the virtues
[6:20] are a section of your journey but the
[6:22] new birth is the beginning of your
[6:24] journey so that to me that's the most
[6:27] important one you if you're not born
[6:28] again today you are not in the virtues
[6:31] of God you can't even understand what
[6:34] I'm saying today that's what the Bible
[6:36] says because I'll read it to you without
[6:38] the Holy Ghost you can't even recognize
[6:40] who Jesus Christ is all right because
[6:42] the world calls him this the world calls
[6:44] him that people call him this people
[6:45] call him that
[6:46] and I want to get y'all's opinion on
[6:49] this sister June said that uh sometimes
[6:51] the red is not doesn't look very good so
[6:53] I'm going to highlight it in a little
[6:54] bit a little bit of blue so
[6:57] um there'll be a survey after the
[6:59] service and uh
[7:03] if it's uh if it's good talk to me if I
[7:06] mean talk to Sister June if it's not
[7:08] talk to her again
[7:13] we're gonna get this thing in a minute
[7:15] where y'all can read it
[7:20] all right
[7:22] beloved Lord
[7:24] he's good to us isn't he I mean he
[7:26] really is he's good to us that we can we
[7:28] can come to church and we can worship
[7:30] God at the time we can worship him now
[7:33] in spirit and truth and then there won't
[7:35] be a time when we'll get together maybe
[7:36] but while we're here we're going to
[7:38] cherish every moment of it all right so
[7:41] let's bow our hands Lord thank you for
[7:42] this day thank you for this word that
[7:44] you give us Lord thank you for the
[7:47] brothers and sisters that's come to hear
[7:48] from you the ones that are at home Lord
[7:50] that can't come because of sickness and
[7:52] different things sister Freedom Mom and
[7:54] Dad the different ones Sister Mary
[7:56] sister Johnny Lord just many many ones
[7:59] that we ask Lord your blessings on them
[8:02] may they Lord feel the anointing just as
[8:04] we feel it today in this church father
[8:06] because we all brought our little licks
[8:08] of fire and father they have their
[8:09] little licks to fire wherever they are
[8:11] father I pray that you should be with
[8:13] the ones Lord that are on the highways
[8:15] traveling uh just bless them and take
[8:18] care of them be with the missionaries
[8:19] they're all starting to come in Lord
[8:21] between now and a couple weeks there'll
[8:23] be many many people come from many many
[8:25] parts of the world father what a great
[8:27] family that we have Lord that's
[8:28] scattered and that we're able to even
[8:30] now for a little while we're able to to
[8:33] converse and to fellowship with people
[8:35] from other countries and see how they
[8:36] live and how God is moving in their life
[8:39] and moving in their church and moving in
[8:41] their country Lord we pray that you'd be
[8:43] with them Lord as they travel give them
[8:45] traveling mercies Lord just bless each
[8:47] one forgive us of our sins in Jesus name
[8:49] we pray
[8:50] amen
[8:52] also brother
[8:54] um Jason Jackson is going to be here the
[8:56] next weekend which will be a Saturday
[8:58] night service at six o'clock and one
[9:00] Sunday service on August the 13th at
[9:03] regular time it'll be a regular service
[9:05] and also brother Jason is preaching this
[9:07] afternoon at brother Luke Gibson's
[9:09] sister June and I are going to go over
[9:10] there and we're all welcome to go if you
[9:12] want to go we're going to go over there
[9:14] if the preacher is not long-winded this
[9:16] afternoon we'll just have plenty of time
[9:18] to get there it's only about an hour
[9:20] from here so uh so we'll try to get
[9:22] finished but we'll go and support Bill
[9:25] Jason there he'll be here in a couple
[9:27] weeks also at the end of the service
[9:29] don't let me forget him when all the
[9:30] kids that are in school and all the
[9:32] teachers we're going to give out prayer
[9:35] cloths and we're going to bring you
[9:36] around up here to front and we're going
[9:38] to pray over you all right because
[9:39] school year starts uh school year starts
[9:43] here pretty quick
[9:44] and
[9:45] we need all the help we can get
[9:48] they need all the help they can give
[9:52] amen so we're going to do that
[9:54] we're going to pray over
[9:56] each and every one so in the beginning
[9:58] was the word where was with God and the
[10:00] Word was God and that word was made
[10:02] flashing dwelt Among Us
[10:04] and we beheld his glory the golden
[10:06] begotten the father full of grace
[10:08] truth John 3 3 Jesus answered and said
[10:11] unto them very very I say unto thee
[10:13] except the man be born again
[10:15] he cannot see
[10:18] the kingdom of God
[10:19] Nick your name is saith unto him how can
[10:21] a man be born when he's old
[10:24] he's taught he he is his mind is way
[10:26] back in the Old Testament colonel all
[10:29] right but Jesus is what he's trying to
[10:31] get him to see the New Testament the new
[10:33] way and we'll get into that just a
[10:34] little bit
[10:35] can he enter the second time in his
[10:38] mother's womb be born no if he did that
[10:39] you'd be the same person he was when you
[10:41] came out the first time all right but
[10:43] Jesus said verily verily I say unto thee
[10:45] except a man be born of water and of
[10:46] spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of
[10:49] God and that s is capitalized So it's
[10:51] talking about the holy spirit that which
[10:54] is born of the flesh is flesh and that
[10:55] which is born of the spirit his spirit
[10:57] so there's a distinction Marvel not that
[11:00] I said unto thee you must be born again
[11:04] you may be seated it's not a suggestion
[11:06] it's not a you might need to be
[11:09] you must be
[11:11] Born Again amen so let's let's read
[11:14] there in First Corinthians 2 verse 12.
[11:16] the Bible says now we have received not
[11:19] the spirit of the world we talked about
[11:20] this a little bit Wednesday night so
[11:22] what's going to separate us the Holy
[11:24] Ghost is the only thing that's going to
[11:25] separate us from the world everybody
[11:27] with me it's not to this and that and
[11:29] going to church and reading your Bible
[11:31] and getting stars and you know believing
[11:33] brother Brown was a prophet and I'm
[11:35] living the best way I can't know you got
[11:37] to receive the spirit that is not of
[11:39] this world because you'll always wind
[11:41] yourself back around to the spirit of
[11:44] the world if you don't have the baptism
[11:46] of the Holy Ghost you will always wind
[11:48] yourself back to where you were to begin
[11:50] with everybody with me all right but the
[11:53] spirit which is of god we don't have the
[11:55] spirit of the world we have the spirit
[11:56] which is of god that we might what know
[11:58] the things that are freely given to us
[12:00] of God we'll talk about in just a minute
[12:02] but let me just put something in your
[12:03] into your memory as Bob was talking
[12:06] um
[12:06] this morning
[12:08] remember those people in the Old
[12:10] Testament they didn't know who Jesus
[12:11] Christ was they didn't know this Plan of
[12:13] Redemption
[12:14] they were part of it but they didn't
[12:16] know it
[12:18] they didn't know all they knew was
[12:19] depend on that priest
[12:21] depend on that priest that's all they
[12:23] knew they didn't know any of this they
[12:25] didn't have a Bible that's right oh yeah
[12:26] they had the Torah later on because
[12:28] Moses wrote them you know the first five
[12:30] books in the Bible so they didn't have
[12:31] that in scroll form but they didn't have
[12:33] it where they could take it home and
[12:35] read it
[12:36] they would just wait till Sunday or
[12:38] Saturday actually for the Sabbath day
[12:40] they would read the how Jehovah was you
[12:43] know this and Moses was this and how
[12:46] Moses led the people out of the children
[12:47] of Israel and I appreciate that amen but
[12:51] I want the god of that
[12:53] I appreciate people that can tell me
[12:55] that they were in meetings with brother
[12:56] Branham and they were this and they were
[12:59] that and they went fishing with him
[13:00] hunting with him I got the belt buckle
[13:01] and all that stuff that's like Moses
[13:03] though yeah
[13:04] it's just it's just a story if that
[13:08] God's not made alive in your heart same
[13:11] way with brother random brother Brown
[13:12] what my God
[13:15] but if I got the god that William
[13:17] Branham had and the god that William
[13:19] Branham brought it will turn me to that
[13:22] message it will turn me to that
[13:25] messenger and know that he was the
[13:26] messenger of this day no doubt
[13:29] no one else no other man had a message
[13:32] like that man had
[13:34] which things also we speak
[13:37] not in The Words which man's Wisdom
[13:39] teaches but which the Holy Ghost
[13:40] teacheth comparing spiritual things with
[13:43] spiritual so we have if you're not now
[13:46] you you are a natural person by birth
[13:48] but you have become by the baptism of
[13:50] the Holy Ghost you become a spiritual
[13:52] person you become where you listen to
[13:54] what God Said you listen to what God
[13:57] Said though through man you got to
[13:58] remember Paul take to Paul take Paul the
[14:01] great master builder
[14:03] Paul was writing 80 percent of the old
[14:06] of the New Testament how did he write 80
[14:08] percent of the of the Old Testament or
[14:10] the New Testament he got it from the Old
[14:11] Testament but he was able to run it
[14:13] through his filter of the Holy Ghost to
[14:16] be able to write Hebrews 11 Hebrews 10
[14:18] Hebrews 9 and explain every one of those
[14:21] things that was never explained in the
[14:23] Old Testament
[14:25] so here we are in a new testament here
[14:28] we are we should be illuminated so much
[14:30] more I mean you know honestly just think
[14:33] about the people in the Old Testament
[14:34] they just kind of went through their
[14:36] life and that was about it
[14:41] that's not me and you
[14:43] we have a Christian journey to walk
[14:46] they didn't have a Christian journey to
[14:48] walk they walked according sometimes to
[14:50] their flesh and but they'll walk some of
[14:52] them by faith some of them didn't care
[14:55] whether there was a sacrifice made some
[14:57] of them would absolutely cry their eyes
[14:59] out trying to get that off of them
[15:03] but when they laid their hands on that
[15:04] animal the animal spirit left but the
[15:07] spirit that was inside that made that
[15:09] man do it it didn't leave
[15:11] listen it didn't have to
[15:14] there was nothing to clean it up
[15:16] but when Jesus come
[15:22] Spirit couldn't only leave it came back
[15:26] and it came back to make somebody
[15:28] Eternal not just patch them up
[15:32] not just sending the bike to a
[15:33] tabernacle
[15:36] I don't mean the one in Jeffersonville
[15:38] either Acts 19 verse 1 and it came to
[15:40] pass it while Apollos was a Corinth Paul
[15:43] having passed through the upper Coast
[15:44] came to Ephesus in finding certain
[15:46] disciples now we're going to get to this
[15:48] in just a minute or maybe this afternoon
[15:49] this is a this is a spot where to me
[15:53] it's a a turning point in the Bible
[15:55] because you've got Luke is writing this
[15:58] commentary right he's with Paul most of
[16:00] the time so he writes the book of Acts
[16:04] and here Paul comes to this certain
[16:06] group of people that maybe he heard of
[16:08] before he said man they're having some
[16:10] powerful service Services they're having
[16:13] some you know some seems like Holy Ghost
[16:15] Field Services
[16:17] they were anointed
[16:21] right and how the Holy Ghost
[16:23] but they were preaching
[16:25] as if they had the Holy Ghost come on
[16:28] right right now watch
[16:31] finding certain disciples so it was
[16:33] people that sat in a message Church they
[16:36] were a narrow message church for the day
[16:37] but they had not met the messenger yet
[16:40] he was fixing to show up and ask them a
[16:43] question
[16:45] I want you to get into this with me he
[16:47] asked him a question he said if you
[16:49] receive the Holy Ghost since you believe
[16:51] this message
[16:54] have you ever seen the Holy Ghost since
[16:56] you've received this new way that you're
[16:58] in now
[17:01] and they said
[17:03] we don't know what you're talking about
[17:07] now here they are versed
[17:11] in whatever they're versed in John's
[17:12] baptism unto repentance they were
[17:14] repentant they were they they were
[17:16] trying to get their heart right but they
[17:17] didn't have the baptism of the Holy
[17:19] Ghost
[17:21] they thought they were in the message
[17:24] oh come on somebody they thought they
[17:26] were in the message
[17:27] they were in John's message because
[17:29] you're going to read we'll read a little
[17:30] bit later on this is just a snippet of
[17:32] it but a little bit later on he said
[17:33] well how are you baptized Paul now
[17:35] here's Paul the master builder he what
[17:37] he's doing is he's tearing down their
[17:39] Tabernacle
[17:41] he's tearing down their Idol
[17:45] and he's showing them the real way
[17:48] he said unto them have you received the
[17:49] Holy Ghost since you believed they said
[17:52] unto him
[17:54] we ain't even heard of this new message
[17:57] we hadn't even heard in other words
[17:59] we're going to read where brother Brown
[18:01] says and I finally I found it the other
[18:02] day
[18:03] where brother Brown says in blasphemy
[18:05] misnames he said it's an ill-taught
[18:07] subject the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[18:09] people teach it this way and teach it
[18:10] that way well that's what was happening
[18:11] here they just wasn't calling it The
[18:13] Holy Ghost they were teaching that they
[18:15] were Christians without the Holy Ghost
[18:20] but when but when the messenger of the
[18:23] hour
[18:24] when he walks on the scene and and and
[18:26] somebody heard his voice they said we
[18:29] don't know what you're talking about but
[18:30] we're not going to run out of the
[18:32] building we're going to sit here and
[18:33] listen to what you got to say
[18:36] and they did and he what happened later
[18:38] on as we continue on Paul expounded on
[18:40] them about the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[18:42] and then he laid hands on them and the
[18:44] Holy Ghost came on them that was a very
[18:46] powerful church it was about 12 people
[18:48] in that church there all right so we
[18:51] have not so much as heard whether there
[18:53] be any Holy Ghost so so the basis I'm
[18:56] trying to show you is is they were
[18:57] taught this way this was it right here
[19:00] yeah
[19:01] measure of the hour John
[19:03] we were baptized under John's baptism
[19:06] well you hear Brother Brown many times
[19:08] he said well that ain't good enough now
[19:11] it was good then yeah Luther's message
[19:13] was good then Wesley's message was good
[19:16] then Pentecost message was good then
[19:22] but not now
[19:23] we moved on
[19:25] brother Brown said you must be born
[19:27] again you must be born again
[19:29] now God bless his word I want to take
[19:31] the subject this morning Jesus's first
[19:33] Doctrine so the first Doctrine Jesus had
[19:35] was what you must be born again that was
[19:39] his first doctrine that was the first
[19:41] thing when he came on the scene he was
[19:42] trying to get the people to see
[19:44] all right and it looked it was a new way
[19:47] because none I've heard about that
[19:48] before
[19:49] they never heard that there was going to
[19:51] be this this uh uh holy ghost from Ohio
[19:54] and it's gonna enter in burn the old you
[19:56] out because remember they're used to
[19:58] going making the sacrifices the old you
[20:00] stand the old you
[20:02] and you're fighting and fighting and
[20:04] fighting your old nature
[20:06] kind of like us before the new birth
[20:09] all right so I want to take the subject
[20:10] the first Doctrine Jesus says is you
[20:13] must be born again
[20:14] now in the way of Sunday school so I
[20:16] don't want preach and horse myself for
[20:17] tonight I thought in my heart this is
[20:19] something that seems puzzling
[20:21] puzzling to the people
[20:23] we hear so much about it all the time
[20:25] and I thought it would be good this
[20:26] morning if we just searched the subjects
[20:29] through and clear it out and watch him
[20:32] that's a very deep subject
[20:35] it's a very deep one
[20:38] and we find out that there's so many
[20:40] different meanings that people put on it
[20:45] nearly all churches say You must be born
[20:47] again but each one has their different
[20:49] interpretation to it what it means to be
[20:51] born again
[20:53] now listen Jesus didn't say you must be
[20:55] born again 17 different ways
[20:59] he said you must be born of water and
[21:01] spirit and then he just finally puts a
[21:03] cap on says you gotta be born from above
[21:06] you can't be born from down here you got
[21:08] to be born from something coming from
[21:10] another dimension into this Dimension
[21:13] and that brother Bob said is what change
[21:15] you
[21:16] not Pat you up
[21:20] my go to the Methodist and they say we
[21:22] believe you must be born again how do
[21:24] you interpret that
[21:25] I go to the Baptist now you know Baptist
[21:28] sorry y'all Baptist you go up you shake
[21:29] the hand you get the right-handed
[21:30] Fellowship they put your name on a roll
[21:32] they stick it in a box and you're born
[21:34] again from there to the rest of your
[21:35] life doesn't matter how much cigarettes
[21:36] you smoke how many times you've been
[21:37] divorced married or if you ever even
[21:40] come to church again
[21:42] no we know that's not true
[21:44] I do believe it once always say brother
[21:46] remember did too but if once truly saved
[21:50] you're always safe
[21:52] so he said look he said if we went to
[21:53] 900 different denominations that'd be
[21:56] 900 different interpretations so seeing
[21:59] that there's so many different
[22:00] interpretations and yet a Bible Doctrine
[22:03] there must be and is a truce somewhere
[22:07] so now remember it didn't say you ought
[22:10] to be born again it said you must be
[22:13] born again
[22:15] now we as English-speaking people
[22:16] understand the word must means that is
[22:18] absolutely you've got to do it
[22:20] see it's a must not you ought to you'd
[22:22] be better off if you did
[22:24] but you must be born again
[22:27] or if we can just take that word this
[22:29] morning and break it down what it means
[22:30] and that's totally impossible in other
[22:33] words to preach it in one sermon then if
[22:35] it's that essential and that great then
[22:36] it's totally impossible to enter the
[22:38] kingdom of heaven or even see it until
[22:40] you're born again and so many different
[22:42] interpretations of that were born again
[22:43] we ought to seek it out with all the
[22:45] heart find out what it means now we know
[22:47] in this church I believe we've been
[22:48] taught
[22:49] the way to be born again all right and
[22:52] but we've got some new ones here and
[22:53] we've got some ones coming from
[22:55] different places so we want to reiterate
[22:58] um and listen
[23:01] if it's one of the most ill-taught
[23:03] subjects
[23:06] it's a subject that's important to
[23:08] preach
[23:10] okay if it was Ill taught in the 60s it
[23:13] sure is he'll talk even in the message
[23:14] of the hour because they tell you that
[23:16] all you got to do is come to message
[23:17] church and and some say just press play
[23:20] and some just say do this and some say
[23:21] do that and and there's never a birth
[23:24] it's just well I've been I've sent the
[23:26] message church for 35 years
[23:30] you've been lost for 35 years too if you
[23:32] didn't get the new birth
[23:33] amen you must be born again 1961 brother
[23:37] Ryan said no matter how much we try to
[23:39] think we're right in saying a Creed or
[23:41] joining a church or let me interplay or
[23:45] you always was eternal you always this
[23:47] you always that we're the bride
[23:49] Hallelujah we are
[23:51] you're the bride only if you're born
[23:54] again
[23:56] only if you come through justification
[23:58] sanctification and baptism with Holy
[23:59] Ghost can you be bride amen you're not
[24:01] bribed by automatic that's right
[24:05] that's too easy
[24:08] well it's not hard to be born again but
[24:11] you fight it because your old nature
[24:13] don't want it
[24:15] I'm sorry mine didn't maybe yours did
[24:21] that's the worst fighting ever done
[24:23] it's myself
[24:25] all right I got somebody Mansion maybe
[24:28] you'll think about it
[24:30] watch this right here though
[24:32] brother Brown says that no matter how
[24:33] much that we try to think we're right in
[24:36] saying a Creed or joining a church
[24:37] because remember the Apostles Creed and
[24:39] remember all these different things you
[24:40] say even the Catholic Church tells you
[24:42] you know that that you don't get the
[24:44] Holy Ghost the the priest does but he
[24:46] gives it to you and by you know speaking
[24:48] to you in a language you can't
[24:49] understand and you guys play money and
[24:52] say Hail Marys and all that stuff that
[24:55] would be rough
[24:56] but look you're still what you were
[24:58] until you're actually born again amen
[25:02] so I don't care how many quotes how many
[25:04] times you can come to church how many
[25:05] times you get stars behind beside your
[25:07] name until you're born again you cannot
[25:09] understand this message
[25:14] it doesn't change you
[25:17] to recite
[25:19] John 3 16.
[25:23] Hebrews 13 8. Revelations 10 7.
[25:26] Malachi 4 5.
[25:29] it doesn't change you your Creed joining
[25:32] church or changing your ideas are your
[25:34] good intentions although as good as it
[25:37] might seem it's still not right amen
[25:39] there's something got to happen look the
[25:42] new birth is an absolute I'm going to
[25:44] put that word out it's an absolute
[25:45] experience
[25:47] something that takes place
[25:51] amen so it's not that you bring so it's
[25:53] not that that brings the new birth in
[25:55] other words to Creed and you know coming
[25:57] to church and all that okay now the
[25:59] different churches they say well you
[26:01] accept this or believe this it's all
[26:02] right but it isn't
[26:04] now to begin with to base back the
[26:06] reason we have to be born again is
[26:09] because the Bible teaches us look that
[26:12] we were all born in sin
[26:14] all right so if you start there just
[26:16] start there don't start that I will just
[26:18] create something back in eternity I was
[26:19] just getting this as one person I was
[26:21] this I was that you were lost
[26:24] if you come through your mama's womb I
[26:27] don't care who you are
[26:28] baby you were born lost
[26:31] there was only one man that came through
[26:33] the womb
[26:34] that was not lost
[26:36] and that's Jesus Christ
[26:38] all right well now if he's inside of you
[26:41] but he wasn't inside of you when he was
[26:42] crying baby down in the hospital or
[26:44] wherever you got born at because
[26:46] remember Nicodemus Jesus said uh
[26:49] that one will kill you I'm trying to get
[26:52] you to see this new one that birth will
[26:54] kill you I'm trying to get to see a new
[26:55] one and I'm telling you that birth will
[26:56] kill you your first birth you're dead
[26:59] born dead
[27:03] we were all born in sin shaped and
[27:05] iniquity and come to this world speaking
[27:07] lies then that shows us that our nature
[27:10] to begin with is sinful to start with
[27:13] yes I know we know that but we need to
[27:15] reiterate that there was no yes we were
[27:18] a gene seed of God in the mind of God
[27:20] but not in your soul your soul was as
[27:23] black as pitch
[27:25] you were dead and on your way to hell
[27:29] William Marion Branham
[27:32] he said he was I'm just quoting him
[27:36] he's sinful to start with we're no good
[27:39] to begin with so we cannot claim
[27:41] anything by our shrewdness
[27:43] by our sincerity our how great we are
[27:47] how little we are or whatever more we're
[27:51] all together wrong to begin with and
[27:53] there is nothing at all that we can do
[27:56] about it
[27:58] the beginning
[28:01] right the beginning is what we can't do
[28:03] anything about you never not one of you
[28:06] decided to be born as a as a human child
[28:08] not one of you it was the Providence of
[28:11] God that got you here so you can make a
[28:14] choice he gave you a soul so you can
[28:16] make a choice
[28:18] so like Genesis 1 we go back to that
[28:20] Genesis one man and we see that that was
[28:22] the children of God that is the bride
[28:24] that's God being able to develop himself
[28:27] in a group of people but then what
[28:30] happened with Adam and Eve in the fall
[28:31] the the as brother Ryan was said one
[28:34] time is he said everything got cloudy
[28:36] and Adam Adam used to have a clear mind
[28:38] and Eve had a clear mind but all of a
[28:41] sudden the cloud started rolling in he
[28:43] couldn't talk to God like he used to
[28:45] talk to God now he didn't lose his soul
[28:47] he didn't lose his salvation
[28:49] he lost his position
[28:53] all right he lost his position of what
[28:56] God had put him as the god of the Earth
[28:59] and Eve right beside him then he had to
[29:02] go into the second Covenant to put Adam
[29:04] here and Eve here because of the fall
[29:06] but he didn't destroy Adam and Eve no he
[29:10] put him on out there and let him live
[29:12] 900 years
[29:15] to start the genealogy
[29:18] natural genealogy of man all right but
[29:22] Adam and Eve's one that you know Adam's
[29:24] one that sold us out we know that all
[29:26] right so what Adam did is Adam forfeited
[29:29] brother Brown says forfeited eternal
[29:31] life now listen he didn't forfeit
[29:33] eternal life in his soul now I want you
[29:35] to understand something
[29:36] once God puts eternal life in your soul
[29:39] he can never take it out
[29:41] I don't care how bad you are
[29:47] remember brother Brown said you could
[29:48] get a spirit
[29:50] on your spirit
[29:52] commit suicide and still be
[29:55] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[29:57] because of our Humanity that we're in
[29:59] that Adam sold that part of us out
[30:02] because look Adam couldn't make us Born
[30:04] Again Adam wasn't my savior so I needed
[30:07] a savior Adam thought he could save Eve
[30:10] but he needed save it oh he figured that
[30:13] out and when he figured that out he went
[30:15] out the garden with Eve and God said all
[30:17] right now I don't think Adam got out
[30:19] there and sat down on a rock and I was
[30:20] thinking about this Adam you know he was
[30:23] this he was just he was the great one
[30:26] control to see control the air control
[30:28] this I'm talking about the whole world
[30:29] Listen he didn't control his little like
[30:31] we're sitting in a building today
[30:33] he controlled the world
[30:39] and then all of a sudden he lost that
[30:41] there you go he lost that Fellowship now
[30:44] I don't believe Adam if if God took
[30:47] eternal life away from him I'd have been
[30:49] really mad
[30:52] but Adam understood that he lost his
[30:55] position
[30:57] and he accepted that
[31:00] and I believe this is just me and we can
[31:02] get to talk to him later on
[31:04] amen but he didn't just go over there
[31:06] and sit get up go up in the mountain and
[31:08] just sit there and saw for 900 years
[31:10] because remember he lived 900 years
[31:12] after that whatever the recording of
[31:14] time was he lived 900 years no you know
[31:17] what he did he told his children what
[31:20] happened
[31:21] he told his girls and his boys what
[31:25] happened and what to stay away from and
[31:27] I believe he was a master physician I
[31:29] believe God still give him the
[31:31] responsibility of putting herbs together
[31:33] and because they start getting sick
[31:36] and there was no Pharmacy
[31:38] he was the Apothecary he did understand
[31:41] that if you take zinc and this and put
[31:43] it together that you would put it on a
[31:45] sore because they started getting sick
[31:46] they started having children
[31:48] diseases Came Upon them and here's Adam
[31:51] saying
[31:53] we can't go in there
[31:55] but I was in there one time
[31:57] and let me tell you this is what you
[31:59] need to do
[32:01] to live better
[32:02] I just believe that
[32:04] because I don't believe he just shut up
[32:06] and went over and sat somewhere for 900
[32:07] years no he was active he had kids he
[32:09] had wife he had all these different
[32:11] things you know so anyway nuts
[32:14] just a little snippet that we sometimes
[32:16] we we think of Adam well Adam he got
[32:18] drove out of the Garden of Eden and then
[32:19] we just kind of the you know the story
[32:22] kind of
[32:24] Peter's out we always call it you know
[32:25] there's nothing else goes on no they had
[32:27] a life Abraham my life
[32:30] Abraham had a life at the South
[32:33] he mad whatever the weather girl's name
[32:35] was he married her and had a life right
[32:38] so anyway I want to talk to them about
[32:40] their lives if not was recorded in the
[32:42] Bible I want to talk to somebody about
[32:43] the one I can't read
[32:45] hey man I just want to do that I mean
[32:47] because they live their life they didn't
[32:48] just live that little well you know
[32:49] Genesis 12 13 14 through 18 and then
[32:52] Abraham no he kept living
[32:56] and brother Brown said what did Abraham
[32:58] do Abraham taught his children
[33:01] about God
[33:03] all right so they didn't just sit down
[33:04] and stalk like we do God don't answer
[33:07] our prayer or we get a little something
[33:09] going on and we just say well God he's
[33:11] not even nowhere around no he's right
[33:13] there with you
[33:15] but you got to be born again first
[33:17] and his brother Bob alluded to Joel 2
[33:20] 28.
[33:21] and it shall come to pass afterwards now
[33:23] watch now why is God doing this
[33:26] because God's going to pour out his
[33:28] Spirit upon All Flesh
[33:31] you know why
[33:33] because there's going to be anointings
[33:35] there's going to be anointed ones
[33:36] there's going to be different things
[33:38] that's going to have to happen so he's
[33:40] going to pour out his Spirit upon All
[33:42] Flesh all right and your sons and your
[33:46] daughters shall prophesy your old man
[33:47] see dreams young men shall see visions
[33:49] and also upon the servant handmade
[33:52] everybody in those days will I pour out
[33:54] my spirit and I will show wonders in
[33:56] heaven the Earth Blood Fire pills of
[33:58] smoke sun will be turned to Darkness
[34:00] mean moon to blood
[34:03] before the great and terrible day of the
[34:05] Lord come now watch and it shall come to
[34:07] pass to whosoever shall call in the name
[34:08] of the Lord now
[34:10] Joel
[34:12] you said you're gonna pull out your
[34:13] spirit on All Flesh and now listen All
[34:15] Flesh is not going to call in the name
[34:16] of the Lord
[34:18] some are going to hate the Lord
[34:20] someone gonna hate the name of the Lord
[34:21] but he's still poured out his spirit so
[34:23] that you can receive it all right
[34:26] by what whosoever shall call on the name
[34:28] of the Lord shall be delivered for in
[34:30] Mount Zion and Jerusalem shall be what a
[34:34] way out
[34:35] Deliverance as the Lord has said in the
[34:39] remnant who the Lord shall call
[34:42] Hebrews 9 verse 1 says invariate the
[34:45] first Covenant
[34:46] and also ordinances of divine service I
[34:49] want you to watch this just for a second
[34:51] and a worldly sanctuary
[34:54] all right so the sanctuary was down here
[34:58] all right everybody with me
[35:00] for there was a tabernacle made
[35:04] and the first we're in was the
[35:06] Candlestick now we always take Outer
[35:09] Court inner Court holy of holies three
[35:10] sections there's only two
[35:14] remember the outer Court is for
[35:16] everybody even Gentiles could come into
[35:18] that outer core it wasn't protected by
[35:21] God's law so much as
[35:24] the second one is or the first one going
[35:26] in
[35:27] when you go in the first one what is it
[35:29] there was a tabernacle made the first
[35:30] swim was the Candlestick the table shoe
[35:32] bread which is called The Sanctuary that
[35:34] was what the second not the holy of
[35:37] holies
[35:38] no no no it was a second Sanctuary the
[35:42] first one out here
[35:43] all right the first I mean the the just
[35:46] say this your flesh
[35:49] your spirit yes and your soul that's
[35:52] what the Tabernacle really was because
[35:54] you flash everything can happen there
[35:56] it's all out you know you're out here
[35:57] you just
[35:59] um you're under the elements if it
[36:00] rained it rained on you if the Sun was
[36:02] shining it signed on you if it was dark
[36:04] it was dark on you all right but you
[36:06] went into that second and the veil comes
[36:08] down and it's covered
[36:10] and then there's a what there's a
[36:12] Candlestick a table shoe bread and all
[36:14] that means something I'm not gonna get
[36:15] to it right now we've been to it many
[36:16] many times all right now look after the
[36:19] second bail so that you've got to go
[36:20] through the second Veil The Tabernacle
[36:22] which is called the holy of holies now
[36:24] look which had the golden sensor and the
[36:26] Ark of the Covenant overlaid roundabout
[36:28] with gold wherein was the gold pot that
[36:30] had mana and Aaron's Rod that budded and
[36:32] the tables of the Covenant what was that
[36:34] the Ten Commandments
[36:36] and over at the cherubs of Glory
[36:38] shattered The Mercy Seat and of which we
[36:39] cannot now speak
[36:41] particularly
[36:43] look now when these things were thus
[36:45] ordained and the priest went always into
[36:47] the first Tabernacle so he could go in
[36:48] and out that first Tabernacle many
[36:50] priests
[36:51] many preachers
[36:53] could go in that first Tabernacle right
[36:56] all right now when these things were
[36:58] thus ordained the priests went all ways
[37:00] into the first Tabernacle accomplishing
[37:03] the service of God but into the second
[37:06] went the high priest alone once every
[37:09] year not without blood which he offered
[37:11] for himself and for the errors of the
[37:14] people now that's Jesus Christ he was
[37:16] the only one who could go back in that
[37:17] Veil and take his blood amen shed it for
[37:21] us yes come back out and say you're
[37:23] redeemed all right because remember this
[37:25] Blood was the blood of an animal he
[37:27] could go in and sprinkle and come back
[37:28] out said your sins are covered not
[37:29] forgiven
[37:31] in the Old Testament right your sins are
[37:33] covered not forgiven all right
[37:35] the Holy Ghost this signifying that the
[37:39] way into the holiest of all was not yet
[37:41] made manifest while as the first
[37:43] Tabernacle was yet standing now I made
[37:45] that in bold letters because I want you
[37:47] to understand if you don't now there was
[37:50] no new birth in the Old Testament
[37:54] now I've had preachers fight me on this
[37:57] and I don't see why because it just
[37:58] takes away from everything that Jesus
[38:01] Christ did I know that the Old Testament
[38:03] Saints are going to be given eternal
[38:05] life I know that for a fact
[38:07] I know that John Baptist got the Holy
[38:10] Ghost because the Bible said he did but
[38:12] he didn't say the new birth
[38:14] I know y'all know that but maybe some
[38:16] that don't
[38:17] you can realize how important this Holy
[38:20] Ghost is
[38:21] it look the Holy Ghost this signifying
[38:24] watch that the way into the holiest of
[38:27] all was not yet made manifest while that
[38:30] first Tabernacle was standing
[38:33] right so while that first Tabernacle in
[38:36] the Old Testament was standing no one
[38:38] got the new birth
[38:41] when Jesus Christ was standing in his
[38:46] Temple
[38:47] there was no new birth yet
[38:51] come on nobody got born again while
[38:53] Jesus was alive they had to die
[38:56] he had to die to bring this new way this
[38:59] New Testament in my blood he says
[39:03] so while the first Tabernacle was
[39:05] standing no New Birth why they had an
[39:08] anointing
[39:09] we've covered it Moses different ones
[39:11] they had an anointing we'll cover in
[39:13] just a second just just for a minute
[39:14] while that's the first time Tabernacle
[39:16] was yet standing look which was a figure
[39:19] for the time then present because Jesus
[39:22] hadn't come yet
[39:24] and which were offered both gifts and
[39:26] sacrifices that could not make him that
[39:29] did the service perfect
[39:32] now what was the promise given as we're
[39:35] going to reiterate what brother Robert
[39:37] said what was that promise
[39:39] the promise was I'm Gonna Come
[39:44] staying according to Genesis 3 15 I'm
[39:47] coming back I'm gonna do it I'm not
[39:50] sending an animal I'm not sending a
[39:53] second person of a Trinity I'm gonna fix
[39:56] this thing myself
[39:58] and if God's perfect then he fixed it
[40:00] perfect
[40:04] he could not make the people in the Old
[40:07] Testament perfect
[40:09] as we're going to read in Hebrews
[40:12] as pertaining to the conscious
[40:15] Inside Man
[40:17] look which stood only in meats and
[40:19] drinks and many Washings and carnal
[40:21] ordinances imposed on them
[40:25] it had to be yes
[40:27] listen Adam and Eve had to be covered I
[40:30] thought they would have died that's
[40:31] right
[40:33] they were covered yes
[40:35] by a substitute until the real person
[40:39] came
[40:42] imposed on them until the time of
[40:45] reformation
[40:46] but Christ being coming high priest of
[40:49] good things to come by greater
[40:51] and more perfect Tabernacle
[40:55] not made with hands that is to say not
[40:58] of this building
[40:59] neither by the blood of goats and cows
[41:02] but by his own blood yes he entered in
[41:04] one time
[41:06] not every year not every time somebody
[41:08] needed it
[41:10] having obtained Eternal Redemption for
[41:13] us
[41:14] Hallelujah
[41:16] for if the blood of bulls and of goats
[41:18] and the ashes of heifers sprinkled the
[41:20] unclean Sanctified them
[41:23] then why'd we need cross
[41:27] Sanctified to the purifying of the flesh
[41:29] how much more shall the blood of Christ
[41:31] who through the eternal spirit
[41:34] not an animal never in their life on an
[41:37] eternal spirit
[41:38] but Jesus Christ did he was the eternal
[41:42] spirit and he could give it out
[41:46] and not diminish yourself
[41:48] you know an animal died if a lamb died
[41:50] it wasn't 25 different lives one out of
[41:52] that animal one went out
[41:55] and never made the camera there until
[41:56] perfect as the Bible says but when
[41:58] Christ died he could multiply himself
[42:02] the only one that can
[42:06] all right how much more shall the blood
[42:07] of Christ who through the eternal spirit
[42:09] offered himself without spot to God
[42:11] Purge your conscience now here we go
[42:13] purge your conscious from dead Works to
[42:16] serve the Living God we're talking about
[42:17] the New Birth today you must be born
[42:19] again right down here at the bottom this
[42:21] is Elementary but guess what we might
[42:23] all need to get born again
[42:26] look and for this cause he is the
[42:28] mediator of the New Testament
[42:32] remember he stood up and said this is a
[42:34] new testament in my blood the Old
[42:36] Testament was the blood of bulls and
[42:37] ghosts that by means of death for the
[42:40] Redemption of the transgressions that
[42:41] were under the under the first testament
[42:47] he's a promise of Eternal inheritance
[42:50] now listen
[42:52] they didn't get that in the Old
[42:53] Testament
[42:56] but now remember when Jesus died on the
[42:58] cross like I said before we're not
[43:00] saying I say we I say us that believe
[43:02] and know that there was no new birth in
[43:05] in the Old Testament they're not all
[43:07] going to hell
[43:09] no that's the grace of God that when he
[43:12] throw both hands out like this he went
[43:14] Old Testament New Testament he just the
[43:16] New Testament was in his blood they
[43:18] could be made perfect these were made
[43:20] perfect and have not been yet though but
[43:22] they will be made perfect by us
[43:25] according to Hebrews 11.
[43:27] for where a testament is
[43:30] now what's a testament Testament
[43:32] something wrote down like a will
[43:34] right everybody with me right so what
[43:37] was wrote down Moses law la la la la la
[43:39] do this don't do that
[43:42] right but there's a new testament
[43:45] a new testament in my blood he said but
[43:47] now look for where a testament is there
[43:50] must also necessity be the death of the
[43:52] testator in other words if this this
[43:54] will is not in force the will that I
[43:56] have written the will you have written
[43:58] the will that our fathers and mothers
[43:59] have written never is in force until you
[44:03] die
[44:04] that's when it's put in force
[44:07] for a testament is a force after men are
[44:10] dead
[44:12] otherwise it is of no strength at all
[44:15] while the test there to liveth listen no
[44:17] one was saved with the new birth while
[44:21] Jesus was here
[44:23] thy kingdom come he said thy will be
[44:27] done he had the kingdom inside but he
[44:29] had to let it out
[44:32] Hebrews 10 verse 14. for by one offering
[44:36] he hath perfected forever
[44:39] them that are Sanctified couldn't happen
[44:41] in the Old Testament wherever the Holy
[44:43] Ghost also is a witness to us for after
[44:46] that he said before this is the Covenant
[44:48] that I will make with them after those
[44:51] days saith the Lord I will put my laws
[44:53] into their hearts
[44:55] and in their minds will I write them
[44:58] and their sins and iniquities well I
[45:01] remember no more
[45:03] somebody read that this morning
[45:07] sorry I already had it there
[45:09] so now look at the Old Testament just
[45:11] for a minute maybe this will explain a
[45:13] lot more to you because Moses had an
[45:14] anointing he had power without character
[45:17] Joey had power he had an anointing that
[45:19] Joel said I pour out my spirit on All
[45:21] Flesh now listen but now Moses was
[45:23] picked for a purpose remember he was a
[45:25] proper child God knew he would do the
[45:27] things he did the bad ones and the good
[45:29] ones God knew what you'd do
[45:33] the Bad and the good
[45:36] so David Sampson Abraham Jacob Noah saw
[45:38] Elisha and all Hebrews 11. that Bob was
[45:42] talking about this morning all those the
[45:44] Great Hall of Fame of faith not one of
[45:47] them obtained the promise
[45:51] the promise that God stood in the Garden
[45:54] of Eden and he said I will put enmity
[45:57] between me and The Serpent and between
[46:00] me and you but I'm coming back
[46:03] I'm going to put this puzzle back
[46:06] together I'm going to be the peace that
[46:09] Satan's not going to know anything about
[46:12] Saint said oh I got them now they're out
[46:14] there and this God's going to kill them
[46:15] everyone well bless his heart didn't
[46:18] have him
[46:21] brotherly
[46:23] but though Devil's persistent he's still
[46:25] going
[46:26] since a dawn of time but he was anointed
[46:29] he was anointed for a job and he's
[46:30] trying to do his job but he's trying to
[46:31] do his job not the job he was given so
[46:34] Hebrews 11 39 so as Bob was reading
[46:36] today we read all Abraham all the great
[46:39] people of faith that we we build our
[46:42] foundation of Faith home
[46:44] remember that's the Hall of Fame Hebrews
[46:46] 11 is the Hall of Fame of faith
[46:49] but it's all Old Testament
[46:53] don't call nobody's name in there from
[46:56] the New Testament
[46:58] Paul said in all these having obtained a
[47:02] good report through faith now I even
[47:03] like you if you go back a little bit
[47:05] further you'll read that Paul is telling
[47:08] you about all these great people and he
[47:10] puts in parentheses and he interplays he
[47:12] says of whom the world
[47:15] is not worthy to for them to even be
[47:17] here
[47:19] all these things that happen to them all
[47:21] they were for an example sure but the
[47:24] world was not even worthy to have them
[47:26] in the in their in their uh on the soil
[47:30] but God wanted him there for an example
[47:33] for me and you and all these
[47:38] things all right Paul's writing his
[47:40] report
[47:41] what did Isaiah say who has believed our
[47:44] report
[47:45] somebody wrote something down about
[47:46] somebody because I just believe that
[47:49] Abraham probably didn't know much about
[47:51] being the father of our faith
[47:54] he just knows he was strange maybe his
[47:57] neighbor knew he was strange lot
[47:59] probably knew he was a little bit
[48:00] strange
[48:01] but he didn't know he'd be his incompass
[48:03] about six chapters in the Old Testament
[48:05] that we have talked about Abraham and
[48:08] still talking about Abraham for six
[48:09] thousand years his life so that was
[48:12] important today what
[48:19] through faith receive not the promise
[48:23] the promise is I'm going to come back
[48:25] I'm going to take that Genesis 1 man and
[48:28] I'm going to put it in the hearts of my
[48:30] believers
[48:31] I'm not going to I'm not going to anoint
[48:33] him I will still continue doing on them
[48:36] but I'm going to put myself inside of
[48:38] them because I'm going to be able to
[48:39] burn out that old nature
[48:43] if you're not born again today you have
[48:45] not had a burning
[48:47] to burn your old nature out
[48:50] you married your two husbands actually
[48:53] and that's against
[48:54] the Bible
[48:57] God look God having provided some better
[49:00] thing for us
[49:04] New Testament
[49:05] that they without us should not be made
[49:09] perfect
[49:12] are complete so so where are they
[49:14] they're somewhere
[49:15] you can say whatever kind of body
[49:18] they're in I just know one thing's for
[49:20] sure
[49:21] the Bible says
[49:24] that they will not be made perfect
[49:26] to We Are
[49:28] so you can put them wherever you want to
[49:30] put them
[49:30] that's fine with me like brother Ram
[49:32] said if you believe he's coming on a
[49:34] cloud or a horse that's okay as long as
[49:35] you believe he's coming
[49:36] that's what he said that's a quote
[49:41] I just believe they're waiting somewhere
[49:43] in an incomplete form
[49:45] because you know been made perfect
[49:47] but they're in a dimension somewhere and
[49:50] and God's got them there listen we God
[49:52] don't need us to tell them where to put
[49:54] them
[49:55] he pushing where he wants to put him
[49:57] right and I you know what I'm happy with
[49:59] that yes sir I just know one thing for
[50:01] sure there's a sixth Dimension where the
[50:03] bride is and God didn't and brother
[50:06] Brown didn't see Abraham Isaac or Jacob
[50:08] in that dimension
[50:09] all right so there must be a dimension
[50:12] that they're all in waiting for us to
[50:15] come to a body change so that they can
[50:17] have their change of their body
[50:19] so
[50:20] there we go
[50:21] so in Acts 2 38 what is this promise
[50:26] what is This Promise they didn't receive
[50:28] this promise
[50:31] well Acts 2 38 will tell you what it is
[50:34] then Peter's standing and then repent
[50:36] and be baptized every one of you in the
[50:38] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[50:39] he sent and you shall receive the gift
[50:42] of the Holy Ghost for the promise
[50:45] the promise of what the Holy Ghost isn't
[50:48] to you and to your children to all them
[50:49] that are far off even as men as the Lord
[50:51] Our God shall call thereby with me so
[50:54] there's your promise they didn't receive
[50:56] that promise
[50:57] all right listen they could repent
[51:01] and listen they can even be baptized
[51:03] under John's baptism because that's what
[51:06] remember Palmetto's people
[51:09] but they want Paul says look that's good
[51:12] but you're not perfect yet
[51:14] that's good but listen you gotta listen
[51:17] to the updated message
[51:20] it came from Paul we gotta listen to the
[51:23] updated message I read this his message
[51:25] I see brother round was saying Luther's
[51:27] message he could stand and preach today
[51:28] and we'd say Amen to most what he said
[51:31] but not all because he's trinitarian
[51:36] but when he said to just shall live by
[51:38] faith
[51:39] amen
[51:42] for the promise isn't to you and to your
[51:44] children all that are far off him as men
[51:46] of the Lord Our God shall call all right
[51:48] everybody with me
[51:50] so let's talk about this just for a
[51:51] minute
[51:52] and then we'll get into it maybe this
[51:54] afternoon even the bottom I want to stay
[51:56] down here let's don't even talk about
[51:57] that Holy Spirit up there because it's
[51:59] the same spirit because God don't have a
[52:02] one spirit all right you either got a
[52:04] Holy One or an Unholy one and I saw two
[52:06] you know that that's so let's bring that
[52:09] down though that's in your soul today
[52:10] either the Holy Spirit or the Unholy
[52:13] Spirit that's in your soul there's only
[52:15] two things in this encompasses your soul
[52:18] today is either black or white now
[52:21] anointings can fall on the outside guy I
[52:23] can follow on the memory reason
[52:24] conscious face imagination from both
[52:26] sides
[52:28] good and bad
[52:30] you just had a bad thought see it's
[52:32] already on the battle
[52:36] black famous names watch brothers look
[52:38] says I believe that the reasons that
[52:40] there's no there's so much confusion
[52:43] today
[52:46] there's so much confusion today about
[52:48] the holy spirit it's not correctly
[52:51] taught
[52:52] I believe that the baptism is taught
[52:55] just say the baptism
[52:58] but then be like you said automobile but
[53:00] now I've got several mechanics in the
[53:02] church so do we and I don't know one
[53:05] thing about it so if I make a mistake
[53:07] brother I'm calling brother Donnie
[53:09] remember I'm not a mechanic
[53:11] there has to be calls plugs points
[53:14] valves and everything else that makes
[53:15] the automobile
[53:17] and when you talk about the baptism of
[53:19] the Holy Spirit there's a lot goes with
[53:22] that
[53:24] all right
[53:26] see there's a lot goes with that and
[53:29] here is what I think that God is proving
[53:33] that the holy spirit is here
[53:35] because what he the real holy spirit is
[53:37] going to what lead you and guide you
[53:38] into all truth it's going to teach you
[53:39] how to get him
[53:41] it's going to teach you how to get him
[53:44] all right it's not gonna Lead You astray
[53:45] listen Satan can't tell you how to get
[53:47] the new birth
[53:49] he can give you and he can give you an
[53:51] anointing to make you act like you got
[53:53] the new birth to a degree
[53:57] yeah that's anointed ones
[53:59] remember he's anointed
[54:02] now Peter said first Faith now watch
[54:04] real close you're talking about down
[54:05] here he's going to Blasphemous names
[54:06] he's talking about the pyramid
[54:08] first you got faith now is your first
[54:10] now add your faith virtue and we've been
[54:12] through all that let's continue on
[54:15] now then from this and then brings this
[54:17] into seven Church ages God is building
[54:20] in seven Church ages of Bride for Christ
[54:23] so that's his whole intent for the
[54:25] Gentile bride and I got to bring this in
[54:27] because there's a bride of Old Testament
[54:29] that he that he divorced
[54:32] there's a bride of the New Testament
[54:34] that he has here which is the bride of
[54:35] Christ through seven Church ages then
[54:37] after the seven Church ages over now
[54:40] there's not a bride in the in the uh at
[54:43] the 144 000 but they do get the baptism
[54:45] of those all right so it's saying it's
[54:48] not anointing
[54:50] it's a birth
[54:52] all right
[54:53] so let's read in Ezekiel we've read this
[54:55] many times before
[54:56] I'm gonna read again
[54:58] because to me if you read this without
[55:01] the holy ghost or even if you read this
[55:03] without
[55:05] a prophet telling you what this means
[55:08] you're going to be totally confused
[55:10] all right so let's read it Ezekiel 36 22
[55:13] therefore say unto the house of Israel
[55:15] now listen this is the Ezekiel and
[55:21] ain't right
[55:23] he could be talking about the remnant
[55:26] and then talking about you
[55:28] he'd be talking about the Saints in the
[55:30] Old Testament and be talking about you
[55:32] all right thereby with me so what he's
[55:36] doing is he's telling Israel
[55:38] I'm Gonna Save You
[55:42] it's Ezekiel
[55:44] prophesying
[55:46] to Israel that I'm going to save you I'm
[55:49] going to give you a new heart I'm going
[55:50] to take the stone but this is to me and
[55:53] you and our new birth because the
[55:55] prophet of God he said many many times
[55:57] he said you know in other words
[55:59] paraphrasing that that this is what's
[56:02] right about this it's not the Holy
[56:05] Spirit come in the first spirit
[56:08] and buy with me see some of you that
[56:10] somebody's not understanding so let's go
[56:12] to it therefore stands into the house of
[56:14] Israel thus saith the Lord God in other
[56:16] words it's going to happen
[56:18] I do not this for your sakes o House of
[56:21] Israel but from my holy namesake so
[56:24] anybody that's under the name of the
[56:25] Lord Jesus
[56:27] which you have profaned among the
[56:30] Heathen whether you went
[56:33] shame on you shame on us right
[56:37] right listen we profane the the Holy
[56:40] Name Of God until we got born again
[56:46] and I will sanctify my great name which
[56:50] was profaned among the Heathen which you
[56:53] have profaned in the midst of them
[56:56] now he's talking about Israel
[56:58] he's talking about all the other the
[57:01] Gentiles
[57:03] all right now watch
[57:06] and the Heathen Gentiles shall know that
[57:11] I am the Lord
[57:13] saith the Lord God when I shall be
[57:15] Sanctified in you yes
[57:19] in you before their eyes
[57:24] Jews on the day of Pentecost 120 of them
[57:27] those were it fell on Jews first
[57:30] we know it went to the Gentiles but it
[57:32] fell on the Jews first because remember
[57:35] excuse me the Jews in a certain place
[57:38] there in the book of Acts they Marvel
[57:40] that's a gentile cops to receive the
[57:42] same Holy Ghost they had they thought
[57:43] that promise was just that I mean Jews
[57:46] were just that way
[57:47] I I I'm God's people it ain't for you
[57:54] for you tell you now where Israel
[57:56] well then Paul walks up and I bet you in
[57:59] a congregation when he said not all
[58:01] Israel's Israel that's probably when
[58:03] they tried to Stone him
[58:04] because then big proud Israelites are
[58:06] like what
[58:08] must God
[58:10] I'll talk to my priest about that
[58:13] all right so look for I will take you
[58:15] from among the heathen
[58:19] me
[58:20] for I will take you from among the
[58:22] Heathen and gather you out of all
[58:24] countries and will bring to you you into
[58:27] your own land this is the promise in the
[58:29] millennium
[58:31] God's Gonna Save Israel as a nation and
[58:35] put them in the millennium
[58:37] then will I sprinkle clean water
[58:40] upon you
[58:42] and you shall be clean
[58:44] from all your filthiness and from all
[58:46] your Idols will I cleanse you praise God
[58:49] I'll take that
[58:51] a new heart also will I give you and a
[58:55] new spirit will I put within you now if
[58:57] you stop right there you say man this is
[58:59] great he's going to give me a new way a
[59:01] new spirit and he's going to put his
[59:03] holy spirit in me
[59:05] wrong answer
[59:07] that's not what it says thank God for a
[59:09] prophet
[59:11] a new heart also
[59:19] also and I will give you an heart of
[59:21] Flesh
[59:22] now you're talking about a Stony heart
[59:23] now Israel a Jew
[59:26] Bruce Tony
[59:27] look verse 27 though is real clear and I
[59:31] who's I who's talking Jehovah God
[59:34] and I will put my spirit now that's one
[59:37] I want
[59:38] I will put my spirit
[59:42] within you
[59:44] and cause you
[59:46] rudder
[59:47] cause you
[59:49] to walk in my statutes and you shall
[59:52] show my judgments and do them
[59:57] we'll read what brother Brown says about
[59:59] that in a minute so let's look at
[1:00:00] justification just for a second if
[1:00:01] that's all right and then we'll we'll um
[1:00:04] start this afternoon a little bit more
[1:00:07] so justification we know that that uh
[1:00:10] when brother Brown teaches us that we're
[1:00:12] Justified that we our past sins are
[1:00:15] chopped off but it really does nothing
[1:00:17] for our nature we're still rotten filthy
[1:00:20] inside right right but justification
[1:00:23] though is being saved
[1:00:30] all right
[1:00:31] it's a fine line there you can't stay
[1:00:35] like that forever
[1:00:37] but it is part of your journey and if
[1:00:38] you do pass away or die during that time
[1:00:40] you're going to heaven but you're not
[1:00:42] right
[1:00:43] because you believe and I will listen
[1:00:45] Romans 5 verse 1 says therefore being
[1:00:47] justified by faith all right believe on
[1:00:49] the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be
[1:00:51] saved everybody with me all right but
[1:00:54] that's not all of it not in this age
[1:00:57] in this age there's a call for more
[1:00:59] there's a call to sanctify that vessel
[1:01:01] clean that thing up and God will do it
[1:01:05] therefore being justified by faith we
[1:01:07] have peace
[1:01:09] with God to our Lord Jesus Christ listen
[1:01:11] you need to know this
[1:01:14] when you got Justified did you not feel
[1:01:17] at peace
[1:01:19] I did
[1:01:21] that God didn't remember that junk I
[1:01:24] just got finished giving to it
[1:01:27] how happy we should be
[1:01:31] Justified freely
[1:01:34] and those who is really Justified he's
[1:01:36] already glorified praise God
[1:01:40] [Applause]
[1:01:44] therefore being justified by faith I
[1:01:47] believe that when I ask God to forgive
[1:01:50] me of my sins that he's just to do it
[1:01:55] he's just to do it because you know why
[1:01:59] he's got to go by what his word says
[1:02:01] and to be just to be a righteous judge
[1:02:05] if you stand there and say God
[1:02:07] I'm sick and tired of being sick and
[1:02:09] tired
[1:02:10] forgive me of my past
[1:02:12] and he will but now remember that guy
[1:02:15] that made you do those bad things is
[1:02:18] still in there
[1:02:20] all right and then if a week from now
[1:02:23] you turn around and go back out in the
[1:02:25] world
[1:02:26] you did get Justified from what you did
[1:02:28] from there back but for what you did
[1:02:29] from there forward you're still the
[1:02:32] account is being added up again
[1:02:35] and somewhere God's going to call you to
[1:02:37] that second stage all right
[1:02:45] therefore being justified by faith we
[1:02:47] have peace with God through our Lord
[1:02:49] Jesus Christ by whom also we have low
[1:02:51] access
[1:02:52] listen when you get Justified you get
[1:02:54] access to God because you've come to a
[1:02:56] place that you like I said sick and
[1:02:58] tired of being sick and tired yeah
[1:03:00] by whom also we have access by faith
[1:03:02] into what this grace
[1:03:04] when we stand what is the grace watch
[1:03:07] this
[1:03:08] John 3 16 there's our Grace
[1:03:11] for God
[1:03:19] 's going to receive it amen only a
[1:03:23] certain group is going to grab it and
[1:03:24] say Hey I want that yeah thank you
[1:03:28] don't grab it and say I might want that
[1:03:32] for God so loved the world that he gave
[1:03:34] his only begotten son that whosoever
[1:03:35] believeth on him should not perish but
[1:03:38] have everlasting life
[1:03:41] be justified today and get killed in a
[1:03:44] car wreck you're going to heaven
[1:03:48] but now six months from now
[1:03:50] if you're still as sorry as you were
[1:03:53] that's for God to decide
[1:03:55] all right
[1:03:56] but you buy your fruit she'll be known
[1:03:58] god listen if you were truly Justified
[1:04:00] if you stand right here
[1:04:03] any of you you stand right here
[1:04:05] and you know what you've done
[1:04:08] from here backwards
[1:04:10] because you were there
[1:04:13] right
[1:04:14] and you knew what you've done but you
[1:04:16] literally believed
[1:04:19] that by some way
[1:04:21] somehow this amazing God
[1:04:26] don't remember that no more
[1:04:29] now we might
[1:04:32] but we see there's the faith you got to
[1:04:35] have faith
[1:04:36] that God forgave you of that and that's
[1:04:38] not piled on top of you brother George
[1:04:40] that's not piled on you anymore listen
[1:04:43] the devil may want to drag that thing
[1:04:45] out of the Sea of God's forgetfulness
[1:04:46] but you put a no fishing sign up
[1:04:50] leave me alone but see you got to have
[1:04:52] faith though you can't say well now well
[1:04:54] now devil I you know he may not have
[1:04:57] amen and you know what if you think that
[1:04:59] he didn't
[1:05:02] when I got Justified I knew the things
[1:05:04] I'd done
[1:05:06] for 20 something years out in the world
[1:05:07] I knew what I'd done
[1:05:10] because I was there
[1:05:11] me and the devil both
[1:05:17] and I knew enough
[1:05:20] of the Bible not the message of the hour
[1:05:22] I knew enough of the Bible
[1:05:26] that he who has truly repented
[1:05:31] God will cut your sins off
[1:05:35] now it says and give you everlasting
[1:05:37] life it's you're going to something
[1:05:39] you're going to get eternal life
[1:05:42] if you if you truly because see the
[1:05:46] Bible says those who has Justified he's
[1:05:48] already glorified now if he justified
[1:05:49] you he's he's going to glorify you but
[1:05:51] you gotta you got a journey to go there
[1:05:54] all right it ain't just instant but if
[1:05:57] you're truly Justified the day you got
[1:05:59] you gottified
[1:06:00] if you realize if today you got really
[1:06:03] Justified you got a glorified body
[1:06:05] something somewhere somehow and they
[1:06:07] don't be under somewhere it's being
[1:06:08] built right here
[1:06:11] if you really believe that
[1:06:14] but if it's just an emotion or just a
[1:06:17] well I felt good
[1:06:19] that preacher made me cry
[1:06:22] that's okay I can make you cry
[1:06:24] people cry at funerals remember brother
[1:06:26] Brandon the first sermon he preached the
[1:06:27] old man said brother Brown said May Cry
[1:06:30] at funerals
[1:06:32] he said bro I made him cry
[1:06:35] for God sent not his son in the world to
[1:06:37] condemn the world but that the world
[1:06:39] through him might be saved
[1:06:42] he that believeth on him is not
[1:06:44] condemned but he that believeth not is
[1:06:47] condemned already
[1:06:49] so it all comes down to Faith
[1:06:53] because he hath not believed on the name
[1:06:55] of the only begotten Son of God in other
[1:06:58] words you don't know who he is
[1:07:01] he can't save you if you don't know who
[1:07:03] he is
[1:07:04] because he's the saber savior sanctifier
[1:07:07] Holy Ghost filler you got to remember
[1:07:09] that that's him that's his title
[1:07:11] and then as we see that we need to go to
[1:07:14] the part of water baptism
[1:07:16] all right
[1:07:19] it's not essential
[1:07:20] but you sure need to be baptized in the
[1:07:22] name of Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:27] real quick sanctification
[1:07:29] now listen here's where brother Brown
[1:07:31] says you get this new heart that Ezekiel
[1:07:34] is talking about or this new spirit
[1:07:37] and by with me not the Holy Spirit
[1:07:40] not yet
[1:07:42] but he's going to give you a new spirit
[1:07:44] even brother Brown tells you he says
[1:07:45] he's going to give you a new spirit so
[1:07:46] that you can what
[1:07:51] so you can deal with your own self
[1:07:55] because you're fixing to go through
[1:07:56] something that your whole life you have
[1:07:58] based on
[1:07:59] that out there
[1:08:02] everything revolved around the world
[1:08:06] and now you've come to this new way
[1:08:08] this new part of your life that you've
[1:08:11] been Justified
[1:08:12] then you come to a new place and let's
[1:08:14] read this real quick and then we'll
[1:08:15] close I'm sorry it may take a minute
[1:08:17] over but I got to get to this right here
[1:08:18] so he gives you a new spirit and brother
[1:08:20] Brown says that's not the whole Holy
[1:08:22] Spirit I didn't bring the quote so
[1:08:24] because you already should knew that
[1:08:25] know this that's a new spirit that's
[1:08:27] that's a new that's a new way a new a
[1:08:30] new feeling if you want to say you can
[1:08:32] go by feelings if you wish but it's a
[1:08:34] new spirit in other words so that what
[1:08:37] he does he softens up
[1:08:40] he's continuing to soften that Stony
[1:08:42] heart up
[1:08:43] make it pliable where he can use it and
[1:08:47] we can let him
[1:08:49] but he gives us that new spirit at
[1:08:51] sanctification now what is
[1:08:53] sanctification we know this is what
[1:08:55] cleaned and set aside for service not
[1:08:57] put in service all right because listen
[1:08:59] Judas was sanctified
[1:09:02] by the Lord himself
[1:09:06] not by some second rate something he was
[1:09:08] justified and Sanctified by the Lord
[1:09:10] Jesus himself
[1:09:12] amen all right so Judas was what he just
[1:09:16] didn't have the Holy Ghost in his soul
[1:09:18] first Thessalonians 4 verse 3 said for
[1:09:21] this is the will of God all right what
[1:09:23] is the will of God's word of God even
[1:09:25] your sanctification so his whole word is
[1:09:28] cleaning us up washing of Water by what
[1:09:32] the word all right that you should
[1:09:35] abstain from fornication now watch that
[1:09:37] every one of you should know how to
[1:09:39] possess his vessel in sanctification and
[1:09:42] honor
[1:09:43] so it's a learning process
[1:09:47] it's a learning process
[1:09:49] Matthews 12 43 when the unclean Spirit
[1:09:52] has gone out of a man he walks through
[1:09:54] now remember this is not justification
[1:09:56] because the unclean spirit's still in
[1:09:58] there at justification
[1:10:01] this is sanctification when you get that
[1:10:03] new spirit when you get that new heart
[1:10:05] when you get when you start coming to
[1:10:07] church you start reading your Bible
[1:10:12] when the unclean spirit's gone out of a
[1:10:13] man you're walking through Dry places
[1:10:15] seek his wrath and findeth none then he
[1:10:17] saith I will return into my house
[1:10:20] but once I came from
[1:10:22] till the devil still got claims on you
[1:10:25] that's what he says
[1:10:27] and when he has come he finds it empty
[1:10:30] swept
[1:10:32] and garnished
[1:10:35] not just piled over in a corner
[1:10:37] somewhere
[1:10:38] not just like we do sometimes open the
[1:10:40] closet and throw everything in it and
[1:10:42] shut the door
[1:10:44] well praise the Lord uh anyway I I just
[1:10:47] heard that happen
[1:10:49] well I'm in trouble now okay
[1:10:54] on my closet doors
[1:10:58] but no he finds that empty swept and
[1:11:00] garnish listen we laugh but listen when
[1:11:02] the Holy Spirit cleans you out he don't
[1:11:04] leave anything lacking
[1:11:08] when he says I'll clean you up he don't
[1:11:10] leave a corner
[1:11:13] but you gotta let him
[1:11:15] then go with him take to themselves
[1:11:17] seven other Spirits more wicked than
[1:11:19] himself
[1:11:20] and they enter in what that same place
[1:11:24] that has been cleaned and swept and
[1:11:27] garnished in other words the old the old
[1:11:30] thinking has been taken out
[1:11:32] but what does the devil do if we don't
[1:11:34] fill it with the Holy Ghost what happens
[1:11:36] he sends seven more more wicked than
[1:11:38] himself
[1:11:41] first then the first
[1:11:47] generation real quick John 17 17 says
[1:11:50] sanctify them this is Jesus sanctify
[1:11:52] them through thy truth now how are you
[1:11:54] going to get Sanctified amen amen by the
[1:11:57] truth
[1:11:58] by the word our problem is we get
[1:12:01] Justified we get to feeling good we know
[1:12:05] that God and listen and know that God
[1:12:07] saved you now that God forgive you your
[1:12:10] sins then you started to church but the
[1:12:12] first little something happens
[1:12:19] I won't do anything Spirit out the door
[1:12:22] and I stay here stay under the water and
[1:12:26] under the water
[1:12:28] if you'll get under the water you will
[1:12:30] get wet yeah
[1:12:32] that's right sanctify them through thy
[1:12:34] truth Thy word is true
[1:12:38] man I'm telling you you gotta fight
[1:12:41] to keep them Devils out
[1:12:44] right but let God help you
[1:12:47] let the washing of the Water by the word
[1:12:52] that's what gets me
[1:12:54] I'm sorry just for a minute if I go over
[1:12:56] a minute just
[1:13:01] eat a banana instead of eating a regular
[1:13:02] meal it'll help you lose weight
[1:13:07] yeah I am preaching brother you need
[1:13:08] that
[1:13:09] and that
[1:13:12] it'll help you with your sugar if you
[1:13:14] quit eating it
[1:13:16] I am preaching brother so I forgot my
[1:13:19] whole thought so I forgot
[1:13:21] but no sanctify him through thy truth
[1:13:23] Thy word is truth and you but you see
[1:13:25] somebody
[1:13:27] and I'm sorry because
[1:13:30] I I'm not
[1:13:32] I'm not
[1:13:34] I'm not building myself up by no means
[1:13:36] but I'm telling you one thing when I was
[1:13:37] out in the world and I did some stupid
[1:13:39] stuff
[1:13:41] I didn't come running to church
[1:13:45] because I knew enough
[1:13:48] that if I ran in here and I wasn't ready
[1:13:52] I just go right back out
[1:13:54] and do the same thing over and over
[1:13:56] again
[1:13:57] I'm not advocating stay away from church
[1:13:59] but I'm telling you every time I had
[1:14:01] some little something in my life me and
[1:14:03] Jim or different things in my life as a
[1:14:04] non-Christian

[1:14:09] wasn't living right to start with I knew
[1:14:11] I had to be changed but what problem is

[1:14:30] right back out there living in sin and
[1:14:32] you know what it's going to pile on top
[1:14:34] of you just like I read that unclean
[1:14:36] spirit's gonna bring seven other guys
[1:14:37] and you're gonna be seven times worse

[1:16:33] away you might step out for a Time
[1:16:36] maybe one service
[1:16:40] put not 10 in a row
[1:16:48] if you want help there's help here
[1:16:51] but you gotta want it you don't you you
[1:16:54] can't want it to get a better car or you
[1:16:57] can't want it to get a better wife or
[1:17:00] you can't want it to get more finances
[1:17:02] or whatever you know you gotta won't
[1:17:03] have yourself changed
[1:17:08] how to do that repent
[1:17:11] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:17:13] Christ for the mission of your sin you
[1:17:14] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:16] for that what promise
[1:17:20] and for their sake I sanctify myself
[1:17:22] that they also might be Sanctified
[1:17:24] through the two truth Ephesians 5 verse
[1:17:27] 25 husbands love your wives let's stand
[1:17:30] our feet nope we'll just have a song uh
[1:17:33] acapella don't come up here and if
[1:17:35] anybody has a need I hate staying over
[1:17:38] but I wanted to get this out but I still
[1:17:40] didn't get to the Holy Ghost Ephesians 5
[1:17:42] 25 says husbands love your wives what's
[1:17:44] a good one to end on them even as Christ
[1:17:46] also love the church and what gave
[1:17:48] himself for it
[1:17:50] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[1:17:54] with the washing of Water by I'm gonna
[1:17:57] say his word
[1:18:00] that he might present it to himself
[1:18:04] a glorious church not having spot a
[1:18:06] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[1:18:09] should be holy and without blemish
[1:18:12] First Corinthians 6 verse 9 says know ye
[1:18:15] not that the unrighteous shall not
[1:18:16] inherit the kingdom of God be not
[1:18:18] deceived look neither fornicators I
[1:18:21] don't want you to raise your hand but
[1:18:22] we're all in this group
[1:18:24] and we don't have a chance without God
[1:18:26] everybody with me read this
[1:18:29] be not deceived neither fornicators
[1:18:32] idolaters adulterers effeminate
[1:18:36] abusers of themselves with mankind
[1:18:39] thieves covetous drunkards revilers
[1:18:44] extortioners
[1:18:46] shall inherit the kingdom of God you're
[1:18:49] all going to hell
[1:18:56] and such were some of you
[1:18:59] but you're washed
[1:19:01] you stay
[1:19:03] [Applause]
[1:19:06] out of you
[1:19:09] and you became a Christian
[1:19:12] but you're washed
[1:19:13] but you are sanctified
[1:19:16] justified in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:19:18] and by the spirit of our God
[1:19:22] that's just that sanctification though
[1:19:24] folks we're not talking about the birth
[1:19:26] yet where he puts my spirit or God puts
[1:19:29] his spirit in us this all happens before
[1:19:32] that
[1:19:33] and that's the whole problem we have is
[1:19:35] sometimes we think well we got the new
[1:19:36] birth just because we got a Sanctified
[1:19:38] condition
[1:19:40] feel good you know
[1:19:42] unclean spirit's gone out
[1:19:44] but it's not remember it's set aside for
[1:19:48] service
[1:19:49] not in service and it's not sealed
[1:19:52] so whatever is in here can get out or
[1:19:54] whatever's out there can get in
[1:19:56] we want the ceiling
[1:19:58] all right we want that we want that
[1:20:00] thing to be sealed up till the day of
[1:20:03] our Redemption
[1:20:04] you love the Lord think about this think
[1:20:05] on these things
[1:20:07] think about your justification think
[1:20:09] about your walk with God are you did you
[1:20:11] truly get Justified did you truly get
[1:20:13] Sanctified and then did you truly
[1:20:15] continue on to the baptism of holy ghost
[1:20:17] or did you just want
[1:20:18] uh and and you know we always say that
[1:20:21] we giggle when we say people find Jesus
[1:20:23] in jail well that's kind of what it is
[1:20:24] it's kind of that you got caught
[1:20:27] and you've become under a conviction of
[1:20:29] just getting caught
[1:20:32] don't get quiet on me
[1:20:35] let's hope that's not what happens
[1:20:38] with your situation that you truly want
[1:20:41] to get rid of it that you truly want to
[1:20:43] be justified and you believe that
[1:20:45] there's a justifier standing here that
[1:20:47] will do it
[1:20:49] and then there's a sanctifier and what
[1:20:51] is it it's the water of the word
[1:20:55] yeah listen when you come to a place of
[1:20:57] sanctification yeah you might have still
[1:21:00] have you might be leaning a little bit
[1:21:01] back towards the toward the world a
[1:21:03] little bit but but you read your Bible
[1:21:07] instead of whatever else she was reading
[1:21:10] before
[1:21:11] you got to make a step
[1:21:13] now listen when you get Sanctified God's
[1:21:16] not going to throw the Bible in front of
[1:21:17] you and say hey read that
[1:21:19] you gotta want to
[1:21:21] see yeah you gotta want to be washed
[1:21:24] by the water of the word
[1:21:26] listen before we go Legion
[1:21:29] had Legions of demons
[1:21:33] that were tormenting him
[1:21:35] Legions
[1:21:37] of demons
[1:21:39] but when he come to Jesus he didn't run
[1:21:41] away
[1:21:43] he confronted the Lord
[1:21:46] and them Demons Inside of him
[1:21:48] said why have you come here
[1:21:51] before my time
[1:21:53] in other words but remember what did
[1:21:55] Jesus Jesus didn't preach him a sermon
[1:21:57] Legion said in other words I want him to
[1:22:01] leave
[1:22:02] what Jesus say go
[1:22:05] go
[1:22:06] and it was that he preached sermon and
[1:22:08] say I am the Son of God he said go
[1:22:10] why because his authority was there
[1:22:13] he was speaking to that thing that when
[1:22:15] what happened to Legion just as soon as
[1:22:17] those demons were cast out of Legion we
[1:22:19] know where they went but the Bible says
[1:22:21] that he was naked at one time but he put
[1:22:23] his clothes on and it was in his right
[1:22:24] mind
[1:22:26] he started going to church
[1:22:30] praise God it's a journey we all need to
[1:22:33] identify with
[1:22:35] before we and I may should have preached
[1:22:37] this before we went up beside your
[1:22:39] perfect man but but we got to know that
[1:22:40] that our foundation is sure because
[1:22:42] Satan will knock us and try to knock us
[1:22:44] off of our foundation
[1:22:46] let's bow our heads Lord if there be
[1:22:50] anybody here that needs
[1:22:51] needs anything Lord I pray that you
[1:22:53] should touch their heart
[1:22:55] and father we will
[1:22:58] give you
[1:23:01] all the honor and glory for anything
[1:23:02] that's that's been going on
[1:23:05] in this church Lord it started from just
[1:23:07] a small group of people to the people we
[1:23:08] are now
[1:23:09] or there's many generations passed away
[1:23:12] as many generations of people that's
[1:23:14] left this church that you don't see them
[1:23:16] anymore
[1:23:17] and you know they're not true and
[1:23:19] they're not right
[1:23:20] father I pray that you'd bring that
[1:23:22] generation back even if there's now
[1:23:24] another new generation of those families
[1:23:27] Lord I praise you bring them back home
[1:23:28] to you Lord I pray this should be with
[1:23:30] the ones that are sick the ones that are
[1:23:32] not with us

[1:26:55] nobody else is going to know it
[1:26:58] you're going to be on your own not your

[1:27:01] in your own time with God because you've
[1:27:04] connected with him and he's I'll be with
[1:27:06] you he said I'll never leave you or

[1:27:37] Lord Jesus
[1:27:40] we remember when we were coming up in
[1:27:43] school
[1:27:45] and all the
[1:27:48] fear and
[1:27:49] not knowing and
[1:27:52] and and and be a shy and apprehensive
[1:27:55] and and all that comes with it but Lord
[1:27:59] I wish I would have stopped one day and
[1:28:01] and said Jesus help me
[1:28:04] Lord may we stop
[1:28:06] and ask for your help today
[1:28:09] Lord with these prayer cloths they're
[1:28:11] going out to everyone in the building
[1:28:13] plus some Lord
