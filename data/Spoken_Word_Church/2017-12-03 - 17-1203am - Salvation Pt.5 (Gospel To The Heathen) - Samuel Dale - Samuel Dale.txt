the dáil clan will be taking off I assume everybody's going but we're gonna run down to they're having a thing for my brother that is 80 years old and they're having him kind of a dinner today we're not going for the dinner we're just gonna run in say hi good to be here and back and be back for the evening service so go ahead at 2 o'clock if we're not here which we will be but you know something goes wrong go ahead at 2 o'clock start to service and if you have to sing a little bit do we get here we'll be back quick as we can cause we're having to go to the time for him they're having him a birthday and you know how they do they don't pay much attention to us we have our evening services they have their night services and most of the time don't even go now so you know they're uh they're not worried about if that's all right we'll take care of so if we run out the door don't get mad because somebody goes by and don't shake an you know and hug your neck and then we'll do that when we come back so line up the door when we come back we'll take care of that we will be won't be late will be no having no problem okay there's a lot out today like traveling so remember each one pray that the lord I believe brother Bob's down in Atlanta or some work he's preaching for somebody but we never didn't know who but just remember those remember the fret the Lord would bless and be with Wade this afternoon and we try to continue on our thoughts and doing of you know the word of the Lord okay father we thank you for a great day in a great time that we've had to be able to worship you and cherish you and to know how to worship you in truth and in spirit Lord because that's where that we need it to be and the only way we can follow that then is to follow thy word and watch the word unfold to each and every one of us and Lord just bless each one bless those ur to be traveling back and different things Lord and just have your way with all of us and you forgive our sins and cleanse us Lord and guide us with your grace and love we committed to you now in Jesus name Amen Jonah - as we've been talking about salvation alright so Jonah says what but I will sacrifice unto thee speaking from the whales belly see the animals belly the we would argue whether it was a whale or the fish who's worried about it he was in the belly of something down in the bottom of the ocean and he wanted to be set free so he said I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord now what about as quick as he said salvation of the Lord look what happens and the Lord spake unto the fish the after he said salvation is of the Lord the Lord spoken to the fish and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry ground growling okay let's go to revelations because if we can get to this point in our thoughts revelations 21 we'll begin in verse 22 to just save time of reading this is the future home the description etc all right a marvelous thing here's their one sin as we get to this now remember this is the future home that's it this is the eighth day this is the thing this is the city described this is an eternity all right look and I saw no temple there in for the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are the temple of it and the city had no need of the Sun neither of the moon to shine in it didn't say it would be shining this is you know I don't need of it for the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof see behind us a kind of glory they didn't have to have no lights they didn't hell no no candles behind it was out in the outside all right what and the nations of them which are saved the nations of them which are delivered the nations of them who received the nation's now you can talk about the bride right and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of the and once and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honor into it you said well ain't no Kingdom remember Russia has a head it's not called Kings like was explaining last night see we think it's got to be well this night in role in the nation's it had was England they were the only one had a king so they're the only one going to be here Oh glory you're smart think about it sensibly it's just expressing the nations of the earth and their rulers right are going to be their clothes all right now and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honor into it and the gates of it shall not be said oh shut at all by day for thou shall be no night there Ian and they shall bring the glory and honor of the nation's into it now remember how brother Branham explained they're going to bring their glory and honor in they go back out well the bride can eat the fruit in the city the nations don't get the fruit they get the leaves off the tree to show no more war when they come in give their honor and glory they go out they take the leaves as a sign but the fruit is for the bride okay they shall bring the glory and honor of the nation's into it and there shall be shell in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth neither whatsoever worketh abomination or maketh a lie but they which are written in the Lamb's Book of Life you may be seated all right then who's going to be in the city the bride of Jesus Christ all right we'll get over to those things eventually we were trying to bring a thought to you to be able to follow things in the correct order because see we read that and we said well when we get over here there's going to be nations that says there's going to be kings there's going to be people here and this is the future home you don't think about where do they come from and what do they do what do you think we need to understand it do you need to understand that acts 2:38 don't contrary to the rest of the Word of God Matthew 28 now it's not contrary to acts 2:38 right do we need to know that and then we have another favorite one is we'll get to it in a little while in the thoughts of the nations and how they're judged we'll say it like this brother Branham changed that later well I won't know where he changed to that see that's your philosophies and your thoughts that fit within and I'm sorry I'm just blunt like that I'm sorry for being that away but I'm not sorry for the word I say maybe the terms in youth about it because I believe the truth all right now what are we talking about salvation the word salvation means deliverance all right so there was a salvation in the Old Testament there was a deliverance you you you can use the word term and deliverances crossing the Red Sea or coming up out of the earth and they were delivered or Israel was delivered out of Egypt as a salvation all right but they was a salvation to people in the Old Testament all right a salvation means to dealing with you as to a future event our thoughts are doing the time that you're there and what you are in salvation those people back there there was a salvation and to prove that the salvation was genuine then the Old Testament people had a place to go to when they passed away that is the proof of whether or not your salvation is worth anything all right see in the New Testament then we read here all the way to the future home and that deliverance of salvation takes us all the way there not just the fact that it takes us and we die and go by the grave and we go as sold under the altar and and those things and have a place to go to that we have a place to finish it all up which is the future home the proof of it is what we just read then there that they'll be the kings of the earth or anger glory and honor end all right but we read to that there's got to be a people who will be in the city that their names were written then it specifies that in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world all right so then there's a future thing to it to her that we're were we're at to that place all right now explaining then our thoughts we picked up in the life message and talking about this past Wednesday talking about a God of compassion all right and we talked about it being that away as the Prophet explained it from sirs we would see Jesus that there's a difference between well so he goes on to be not afraid and he goes you know other things but I didn't bring them but if you want them what is compassion there's a difference between compassion and sympathy all right Jesus walked into the pool are healed one person and walked out why did not sympathy make him heal them all it would have hurt if he just had sympathy but he had compassion all right now what was our thoughts about it how did brother Branham explain it compassion is to do the will of God sympathy would require that he save everybody and do everything and to keep him from being a respecter of persons he would have to bring that to PI's that would be sympathy but God is not a God of sympathy you said well you don't think he sympathizes with with people he don't sympathize with anybody that turns him down remember word rejecters where do they go word rejecters go to hell well is he gonna be standing I wish you wouldn't go I wish you would know that sympathy but when you come to compassion it means to do the will of God and God's will is his word so if we turn down the word we're automatically rejected that's no problem because that's where it's made but remember now compassion the said he went in and he healed that one person he came back out all right now the scripture says what I do nothing until the father I see the father you know doing it on test James 5:19 all right see he knew and could walk in there and heal one person then and come walking out and that be the will of God right that was the will of God fulfilled right there walking in and walking out and healing one person see that we talk about sympathy because the word compassion if you look it up in Webster you're gonna get an interrelated point of sympathy and compassion right because it's going to give you a human definition but in Bible terminologies compassion is for God to keep his word right there's compassion the best definition you can get out of all of it that's for him to keep his word and see then he doesn't have to you can't argue with him about things so he goes by you keeping his word but we get our human thoughts as we were talking about last night the Bible says that he raised up Pharaoh to prove his honor is everything right did he give a favor or change did he give him a change if he didn't give him a chance he's not God well where did he give Pharaoh change when Moses first went down there Moses walked in there and said let my people go he had a chance right then to turn and let them go but he made his choice by saying I'm not gonna do that then you say well but the Bible said he hardened his heart he couldn't harden his heart to start with once he made his point I'm not going to let him go there was no problem then God could harden his heart yeah but remember now in each account listen reading Bible Moses would go into it and he'd say let us go out so far and come back you know after a while Pharaoh agreed with him after a couple of plagues right Pharaoh got to agree with him he said just go out there so far and do this and this do that and come back but the Bible said God hardened his heart what did he do he simply said to Pharaoh Pharaoh if you let them go they're gonna keep on going he hardened his heart but that's what I'm getting at see we think we know what we're talking about we think we understand God in his ways but what about a compassionate God that will never break his word he won't break his word to do something he's exactly with his word what I'm saying then if you take Pharaoh you read the Bible well the Bible said did he raise Pharaoh up for that reason well you got it we got the scripture but if he didn't give him a change we said well Jacob have I loved and he saw have I hated you think he didn't know before there's born whatever gonna do so what to do you know II saw what he done is what God saw in his mind before the world right see we think we get it all figured out because we can read a scripture or a quote from the Prophet instead of listening to the thought and thinking about the answer and what it would be remember you're talking about a God that cannot break his word well God can do what he wants to he can do what he wants to but he can't break his own word cause he broke his own word he wouldn't be God is that plain enough well I know wait a minute he he said he raised this up and done this that and the other go back and check how you raised him up you'll find exactly what I'm talking about he walked into Pharaoh and he said Pharaoh let my people go Pharaoh's would've made the choice God never made him act like that you remember what we were talking about Wednesday night that this baby's our baby's born mean you remember that from Winston the babies are not born mean they're born with a sweet humble spirit about they learned to be mean by the ones who raised them cold where do they learn from you remember that let's see Pharaoh he raised up a little baby just like everybody else but he went after those things and that's what caused his nature we'll get back to that in a minute but what we were talking about but you understand we covered Wednesday night talking about the thing that is confusing to our thoughts in our minds how that God would raise up a heathen heathen I put our on there you know a seat I put the ER in just like I say woman you know you remember that I've always said woman he spell it with an R he spelled heathen with an R that southern Dale language he then is overcorrected life not he's supposed to say heathen not he learned a lot the heathen he he gets I'll call him an unbeliever that's a better word huh what about a people who will wind up in the Millennium to hear the gospel now listen what I'm saying none of us could read the Bible and find that it took a prophet that the word could come to to tell you what the Bible says yeah but the Bible says the Bible says but bringing it down to human language we interpreted is the wrong thing trying to get that point across wins because I want you to make sure to understand one thing to understand why your prophet and we gave the scriptures studying it out Wednesday that the fact that they would be a heathen in the Millennium to hear the gospel that God would raise up but see we as I said we can't read those things we can't even hardly read Romans when he's talking about the the Jews and they're doing and wind up with a field field you that will be given eternal life even though they rejected Jesus Christ that they were blinded of God to worse Gentiles could come in but yet we try to figure all about this that the other block oh this happened on the Bible just says they were blind we see we know nothing about those things my point is to try to get us to a place to think about this message and what a great understanding it is to think about that God would actually save that filthy old Jew come on Ricci seals fulfills you is that Israel from the time of Calvary down to where we are you know whatever is your prophet would cover it is the those Jews that were blinded so you and I could be saved isn't that a wonderful that's the most marvelous thought so grace you don't think like that you don't think that God would would blind his own people and then turn around and give him eternal life that's a marvelous now listen that's a God of compassion now listen that's not a God of sympathy sympathy would require did he save everybody compassion would be to do the will of God and God's Word you say words it said it romans tells you of Israel that was blinded that we could be brought in it's in the Bible just as we were reading and talking about that heathen that would be given an opportunity to come to the Millennium and it would have to be raised up and brought down and give it an opportunity to hear the gospel some marvelous understanding and grace remember you're saved by grace through faith now remember to just as it is with that it fills you God can't break his word so he told in Romans he told through the Prophet that what you remember we read at Wednesday that those people because of being good and kind people under their own laws in times would wind up to go to the Millennium and given a chance to hear the gospel you don't think like that how marvelous that is no you're only thinking about your own salvation into doing that's your only thinking you're glad that God is keeping you from dying going down you're not serving God out of a love you're serving God because you're glad that he didn't letting you go to hell for your knowing that we judged we need it it's supposed to be ours but that was what I'm trying to bring out Lyndsey of the Prophet in the way that he was explaining grace that that people would actually be given a chance to hear the gospel in the Millennium oh but brother Dale I don't grow cilantro he says I ain't gonna be nobody in the Millennium but with the bride and a few Jews it's gonna be pretty well crowded go we got a bride it's gonna be there we got 144,000 it's gonna be that we got Israel as a nation it's gonna be there I'm quoting brother Branham now we've come up with a unbelieving people heathen now as we were discussing last night and we said we'd get back to that what do you think about is a heathen well that's the aborigine over in in worth australia some Aborigine jungle guy back in there or we think it's some african tribe what do you think about that would make a heathen see we try to make it as to something that we think about it as then being some kind of an uneducated but the idiots that know nothing if your profit would brag on him and say he said daily are better by their tribal laws than we do by everything else said before they can even marry said they've got to have a virginity test and if the girl is not still a virgin she has to tell who and they kill both of them logs that make us Christian nation oh we're a Christian nation Christian what what did brother Brennan put on the end of that when were you talking about that if they had to take the virginity he said I hate to have to do it here is that true and they remember one time now listen really did try he said I'd hate I'll find it I kissed her phrase mister club he said I'd hate to think of how many virgins you'd get out of a choir oh then we could go to church in the choir and pick out I didn't write the book sorry for finding it why do you get upset with me for finding what the Prophet says or the Bible says you're gonna find out when these days where that all comes from where it's going to because it we're still trying to find one thing a way to get us out of here alright brother branham on the message you go ahead and pull up number six if you want to word in case somebody comes along and don't don't know it will give you number six then we'll come back to five and four and pick it up well what is brother Branham say on the message on the handwriting on the wall that he's talking about these heathen that we think are just nothing that's just him people back in them jungles we're going to get around to it in just a minute we're gonna find out what about the people sitting today in churches hearing what they think is the Bible but it's not the Word of God does God look at one he's indifferent yeah we'll give you the definition further than a minute so but listen have you ever thought about what about a people listen to the Prophet this is taken from the message the handwriting on the wall 1958 in the book of Acts the 10th chapter and the 35th verse they probably said I perceive that God is no respect of nation or person but will accept such as will serve Him in righteousness watching no matter what church you belong to God expects you to respect to him and he wants you to serve Him in righteousness now watch him the I'm saying this is common sense but they should have made another paragraph Astarte because they changed their thought when you change your thought in English you're supposed to make another paragraph but look they did he wants to serve you to serve Him look if we fail to take them the gospel then God will judge them according to the knowledge that they had and how respectable they were to it Oh bless His name what are we still like as I said and I don't mean it in this raga Tori but just that's the way that was said see we old Baptist we said ain't nobody going to heaven and ain't done less a bard again but then we find out if there's a a foolish version that can be that we finding out a lot of people going to be that they've always had fed with we think maybe the millennium just gonna be high for dozen people running around like the brother said life's not about it when you gather all them people together and you put infinity and you just keep going with infinity and infinity it might take a lot of infinities to be able to hold all the people you know what I mean might take a whole lot of world I don't care what you're talking about I'm talking about if we don't take them the gospel we're gonna have to give an account if we don't take them the gospel God has a way of doing it he'll judge them people by their own laws and the way they live well what was that how to do salvation it has a lot to do with salvation when we read from Romans you remember what we read down from Romans how that the people will beat let's get that scripture go ahead get Romans order that Romans 2 Romans 2 let's get it and just read it Romans 2 yeah now listen for when the Gentiles what is a heathen even what is it even a Gentile it just simply means nations the word doesn't signify people it signifies nations all nations are Gentiles well because God was dealing with one nation called Israel and everything else was Gentiles so look and when the Gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law in other words if they live a good life by their own nature what's what it says having not the law or a law unto themselves which show the work of the law written in their hearts in other words they're living the law to the letter and know nothing about it because it's the nature their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts the mean while accusing or excusing one another we think oh it's got to be through this it's got to be through that I'm telling you I've tried to tell you we're still in the Old Testament we got to the New Testament here with the blood of Jesus Christ I'm talking about a salvation in the Old Testament if our salvation in the Old Testament listen is not correct and in perfect line up how can you expect the New Testament to be worth anything if he couldn't keep his word no test we can't keep it in the new yeah but Jesus come to do yeah remember Jesus come to not to destroy the law but to magnify the law right the law said thou shalt not steal Jesus said if you think about the law says thou shalt not commit adultery jesus said if you think about it he magnified it you see I want you to go back I wish you'd go back now and listen to Wednesday night services well they're good well read you Playboy magazine and get on your Facebook's and run all of these other doings and just do all of that and don't let do what you're asked to do I simply ask you every once in a while to simply listen to a message well I was dying hurting what'd you hear see that that unbeliever all right will be judged not by God's Word not by the ten commandments not by those things he'll be judged by what according to your prophet the law he lived under of his own people now what a wonderful God that is you don't think about that how gracious he is that those people will be able to hear the gospel and be in the Millennium now if you're gonna be in the Millennium just remember if they're raised up in the Millennium is of trying to say a little bit life's not about do you think God's gonna turn around it at the end of the millennium and judge him and throw him into hell after he's done raised him from the day it and brought him up to hear a gospel you realize that person that's intimately and your prophet we're gonna read where he said it would be in the Millennium will he change that later okay show me war planes show me work well I don't believe that Cody's changed it later show me where showed me where he ever changed at all see we don't want to believe it for some unknown reason you mean I've got to do this and I've got to do that I've got to do this and I've got to do that and that unbeliever can just walk right up in there and go right on the end of the millennium and be thank God because I ain't got to do you ain't got to do we do it because of the love that we have in our heart for him if you live a Christian life because you're trying to get out of going to hell you're in bad shape if you live in it according to as I said about the the Gentiles they do by nature what does it mean they do by nature the nature of a baby is to be good it's trained to be wrong babies not born mean but they become mean because of what's around them the environment that the devil's domain that we come into as I've always said - you know - poor little baby it's born laying in a hospital bed and the first thing it remembers is hearing them nurses cussing and raising Cain about how many babies was born that night the poor little fella ain't got to change right and see you remember what we were talking about Wednesday night the way we raise our children is the way they will be well I raised my children right I tried but a failure that's the best way to say I raised him to try to be honest when a bank man come along one day and he said fella that was running the bank he said whatever you and your wife done said you've done a good job raising three kids well I felt good about that because of a man of that caliber or authority to be talking about the fact that our children were good children we tried to raise our children to be good but still how much did they see of us you know where did they learn some of their things from as I said what do you talk you look at the baby you look at a little kid and he's walking it was was it yesterday or this morning there so and this guy was walking on the side the road and his woman and he's walking like this with his feet spread out and I just died laughing because here come a little boy about ten years old he's walking just like Daddy that's right they learned from you and me okay if you want to listen to the message I try to preach the best I can in love to understand but I don't preach it with no CC five-point I try to make it plain our children we raise them to be what we want them to be what about that little African he's earned that knows nothing no he knows everything just like that a baby's born here in America because he's watching somebody and following somebody and some of them wind up with a real good nature because they're gonna be there the nature the others who wind up with the wrong nature is going to be unbelievers that are cast into hell I'm not saying that they're all going just recoated in your the gospel that is not the way bread around didn't explain it that way and the Bible don't explain he explained it as being the nature and that's what the Bible explained it as being the nature that child has a nature that is indwelt within it from its birth coming up Adolf Hitler was no different than any other child Judas Iscariot was no different than any other child they finally went after their own thinking because of their ways and what was around them and and everything else motivated them you studied a little bit about Hitler you know Hitler he wasn't he was pretty bad we think he was bad but you know what he tried everything in the world to get the office till he finally got an office just take a little bit about him he'd done anything he would get in office he finally got an office he wrote this and he wrote that he was in prison he was the church whether we believe it or not we have trained our children to be what we want them to be no I raise mine to be a Christian well then did we act like Christians in front of them plain honest answers now what do we do come on that's all I'm trying to get to like Wednesday night is how that God would look at that people that we look at is unsavable on all things they know nothing about the true God of the Bible what is a heathen what is an unbeliever wage was given the terminologies for it like not what it's a group of people that do not believe in the true God this is good of definition this could be anymore an unbeliever is one who do does not believe in a true God do you realize then whether you like it or not and you're gonna face it God I'm gonna explain it the best I can we've got foolish virgins we've got people that's going to be given eternal life that's what I'm trying to explain is there's people going to be given eternal life I'm trying to explain how and you get upset with me cause I'm saying you know right now everything in the world is an unbeliever except the born-again believer who has believed in this message to the point that it is the message of Almighty God everything else is unbelievers now let's get a little closer what about all the doctrines that are in this message that are playing unbelievers come on we're gonna get it one of these days we'll be right the Bible says fear not little what did your prophet say I doubt a dozen out of this generation need me talking about whether you're saved or not right he's talking about a change of the body get it right he's talking about something coming to a change what is causing you and me that we've had all these years why would we come to a change sitting in her in the woods rather they thinking about it I said thank you Lord you realize that when Adam and Eve sinned they sinned by protection of the tree of knowledge right do you realize the whole world has been under that condemnation from that day till now and listen do you realize even you and me that are born-again believers come on up we're still eating of the tree of knowledge no no no we're not we got the word now well not you got two souls you got two lords you got peruses you got everything in the word as you claim what do you believe you realize if it's not the one true and living God and believing it correctly we're still unbelievers now you want the scripture what did it say to Adam and Eve which was saying it to ever person that would ever be born the day you eat thereof that day you die the reason you and I are doing it you know what we're doing we're dying every day if you don't believe it honey get in front of a mirror just for a second and take a look you're dying why because we're still eating of the tree of knowledge you can call it the Word of God you can call it the message of the hour but if it's not true and exactly lined up in the Word of God like in the Old Testament God was dealing with one nation is that right Israel was the only nation that had the understanding of God and the whole world was unbelievers but Israel and you had some float in because you had the Moabites that come from Abraham you had this group that come from Abraham so then you had an example back there just like you've got examples now you've got foolish virgins right there are not born again right that's why they're foolish virgins but they're believers and Evon confessors until one day they will be given eternal life because of their confession are you with me so is the Moabites it mad in with the Israelites so is this group that they came in and what was the word proselytes is that the word for maybe come in and they had to do this at the other you remember if they came in they had to be circumcised they had to do this why because the God was dealing with one nation called Israel because Israel was the only nation in the world that had the understanding of God the true understanding that's why they were chosen abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness you realize what I'm talking about all the whole world was unbelievers but their leaders realized they come on all Jews or not Jews all original eyes not Israelite we know the story with you talking about it last night Abraham he wouldn't Jew he was a Gentile he was a Hebrew you know what the word Hebrew means Hebrew doesn't mean as a nation or a point Hebrew was the point of what it said I brought your father Abraham from the other side of the river the Bible says that the big river from the other side the flood right where the guy looks one danger comes Abraham arose Abram then he's walking the cross and the guy looks at him he said what's your name he's my name is Abram oh you're Hebrew you just crossed the water that's how he got his name that's how he wound up with Abraham being the Hebrew see there was no true lineage but you didn't come in until somewhere over in the Kings and the Jew only signified two tribes one of them was Judah the other one I can't remember the one that went with it but remember it that's time the ten times is over here and bondage and he's ten two tribes was over here and they were called Jews why did not God come from the tribe of Levi the Levitical priesthood you don't never think like that why didn't Jesus Christ physically now we know we don't have no lineage so don't run wild with it good if you run the lineage of Jesus you know where it's gonna stop that it's gonna stop in Joseph it ain't gonna stop in Mary it don't get to marry it stops in Joseph Joseph wasn't the daddy of Jesus that's why you can't run natural vintages but to Judah the reason he's a Jew it's not that if actively being Judah or been Jew it means chosen Jimmy's chosen or God's own the Bible says I don't Judah shall come a lawgiver that's why Jesus had to come from the lineage in line of Judah not down through David I don't die not only needs you can do it it's a spiritual lineage it's not a physical lineage it's what heats me alive about these people in the message oh if I was a seed what seed you're talking about the only seed I want to be related to is the seed of Jesus Christ the one that was promised in Genesis that I'll put my seed I'll put the covenant between I'll make a difference in your seed in the seed of the serpent I'll give you the seed of the woman which is a promise of Jesus Christ's coming see that's what I'm trying to get see you think about well how in the world would God say this people that's a you don't even understand what he's talking about those people never heard they never heard the truth people in the Old Testament all the way through they never heard the truth the nation's as far as a nation I didn't you're the truth they were he through they were unbelievers Israel was the only believers and Israel coming from Abraham Abraham was a Hebrew because he comes with ya the Bible said I brought your father Abraham on the other side the flood what Abraham never come physically from the other side the flood it's a spiritual seed that was promised I put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman there's your spiritual seed I don't care about physical seeds it's spiritual seed Jesus comes from the tribe of Judah not from the Levites why didn't he come from the Levite Levitical priesthood isn't he not the priest is he not the high priest is he not all of those things we never come from that why because he come from Judah because the Bible said God of compassion has to keep his word the Bible said he couldn't come from Levi he had to come through Judah because that would make him dinner Jew God's chosen see we're not as realized at all in but all Jews are Jews all true Israelites are true Israelites of the God of Jehovah when they'd Israel go wrong is when they turn down that one standing there that said before Abraham was I am under God that was back there and you worship me are you gonna be like the rest of the heathen you're gonna be like the rest of the unbelievers so what is it today when Martin is wave come that life not when Martin Luther was bringing the truth it doesn't matter if he's Trinitarian or whatever it was he brought the truth of the day that put him in the body of Christ gave him a born-again experience but didn't it kept moving down until the Prophet come to bring us the word in wait spoke was something our today he'll get back on it because see it's in the Word of God God's going to keep his word he said in Romans are he said them people will be there because they have a nature about him a good nature that he loved what did what did God say he said your your your offerings has become a stink in my nostrils is that true you know what he said he said I look to a man that is honest and a contrite heart he wouldn't look at no more at offerings when guys over tower offering offerings and he says boy bless God I'm glad I'm done it I'm glad I've offered this offer and it's making me right and here's an old unbeliever back out in the boonies it's just living a good life and God looks at him and it says you'll be the looks at that Jew that so lined up in his lineages so lined up in his do's and dont's until he winds up and God cast him away cause according to your nature I thought we believed the nature of your soul was God if he's born again come on listen do you realize then that in that millennium those people let's go back to that one number six oh no excuse me number four let's go back to number four I'm just jumping back and forth on this is all girl you listen to Wednesday night because that was the message where it was broke if you listen to it the messages are the things that I say it is dark as you can see what we're talking about you can see why that unbeliever can be in the Millennium but yet a true staunch old Jew rabbi you know less God I'm on my way to have him Carter kept the law and Paul said it's not those who glory in that he said it's according to their nature that old fire seeds stand up there and could quote you the Bible and claim his lineages and show everything and turn around and kill the Gentile just because he wouldn't believe her he didn't care you don't care about killing anything I like the way brother Branham talks when Moses figured out what he's doing you know already killed Egyptian you know what brother Ron said he said of all the training that Moses gotten his life to be the delivered Israel said he wound up with a stinking dead Egyptian now I like that you may not like that you might think it's derogatory I don't it's just a simple point of showing that Moses believed it and was willing to kill for his belief all right let's go back to number four and pick up this that there's going to be people in the Millenium trying to bring it out licensed that Wednesday night questions and that's which is number four in Jeffersonville you talking about the seed and never they need to return of the church and the bride the bride in Christ shall walk out upon their ashes in the Millennium that's the ones that are not right that's the people who have the wrong nature now put it that way now put it that that's the people who become unbelievers and things because that they take their own nature and they learned to be eel and mean and arrogant and hateful and kill each other they're unbelievers right with what about the believer and run of the church and the bride the rotting Christ shall walk out upon their ashes in the Millennium when the earth is purified by fire then they shall reign and the heathens that's never heard the gospel she'll be raised in that time and the sons of God will be manifested now listen if there is no other writing in the Bible you say well what are you gonna get that out where are you going to get a gospel and who's going to bring it and it can be to a people in the Millennium Scripture I read it when we first started revelations right let's read it again revelation did you listen did you follow the reading go ahead pull up the revelations let's get that one oh I got a hurry revelations 21 and said in the cities there's no need and all for the glory of the Lord shall delight in the city and the nations of them which are saved that's what it says in Revelation the nation of them that are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honor into it and the gates of the city shall not be shut all the day and I there shall be no not there and they shall bring the glory and honor of the nation's into it but nothing can enter therein that's a dirty word it names a murderer or longer etc won't did they have their partner like a fire now back up to four if you don't believe it you're not gonna believe it anyway back up to number four I'm sorry I made them throw it back as a fortune huh what it's manifested listen to what God says about you and me and the heathen that's never heard the gospel she'll be raised in that time and the sons of God will be manifested in the Millennium watch this is so prevalent with the people of the message until the late sixties you know what they talk ain't gonna be no manifested sons and daughters of God here in this world all gonna be in the Millennium I said then one point what do we need them in the Millennium for that's fulfilling God's work we need them now because we're sick we don't need to wait till the Millennium to have a manifested sons and daughters we need them now but listen heard the gospel shall be raised in that time the sons of God would be manifest if he's to reign he's got to have something to reign over he's got a domain and they ruled and reigned with Christ and Christ rule and reign with a rod of iron the nations then the gospel then to manifest his sons of God with the authority just like they had when he was here see they will come to the Millennium and they'll rule and reign over the heathen has never heard the gospel they're going to hear it from you you know I've tried to explain some things that I think you think I'm silly do you realize in the Millennium is you're gonna have an opportunity and those unbelievers are gonna come to you and you're going to explain Jesus Christ a gospel - it ain't gonna be just the time of playing around doing nothing what about Moses what about the great Moses they got the pattered in heaven of how to build a temple but he never knew why he put this here in that dock but around says him Jews till today do not understand them two loaves of bread that's what he said now he said them Jews don't understand that so what are you gonna do you gonna explain to it why this is here you're going to explain to this what this is here it'd be a great millennium time 24 hours a day having service dost will be in priest either hearing that and walking in the light what about it - a group of people that looks like they're worth nothing what's the reason for them to be able to be there because they were good people and lived according to the law by nature now let me ask you a simple question not is it not the fact that the new birth is the Word of God to be lived in you and I by a nature that correct and the right it's supposed to be lived by nature we're not supposed to that's this is the nature of God this is the nature of God right here the statute a perfect man is the nature of God are we not supposed to be living by according to that nature are we living in according the book of rules within what's wrong with what they were doing by nature what the jews was doing by natural and God looked at them and says this group goes out away some of them gets the right but this group can be given an opportunity to hear the gospel what a wonderful God we serve that he's mindful of every little thought and idea that we have he's into that point for the Gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law these having not the law are a law unto themselves Roman 2:14 why can't we look at that and see it but see our problem is we want salvation for ourselves and our little groups we don't want it to give it to somebody else I've always told you and I believe it from the day and I was in this message two years before receiving the baptism in the Holy Ghost and from that day to this day I've tried to give that religion deliverance salvation away I try to give it to you try to give you the gospel which is the nature of God to explain to you the wonderful things of salvation to be given to people who do not deserve me whatsoever and if it fills you to be Kevin it that was Fitness face brother Branham said it this way one day he said God comes down every day and heals Israel he said and they wouldn't have a thing in the world to do with so when they rejected that Old Testament Jehovah as being the New Testament Jesus Christ they became unbelievers then on the day of Pentecost it came in to a Gentile dispensation the Jews were left out not left out because of use the word Gentile means Nations there's born-again Jews right truly born again believers accepting Jesus Christ as their Savior you no matter what nation you are that's why it says it was our the nations of the world the kings of the earth will bring their glory in their honor into the city as I said to have to turn walk out why because they don't have the eternal God dwelling within them they don't have that point so what is a heathen he's an unbeliever an unbeliever and the one true and living God and many unbelievers are the end of message and many of us are unbelievers bless God I got a revelation one God so it's all these doctrinal thing we even believe this was the life stock from the message that all babies go to heaven that are under the age of accountability right God is so gracious to a baby under the age of accountability we were talking about it lies not what if the world ended right today and blast it away do you realize how many billion babies would go to heaven they used to bother me when he would say destroy God would tell the people destroy all the men the women and the children listen God how could you tell him to destroy a child the child got nothing one day he finally got enough of it and spoke to me and he said by taking them getting them early I'm taking them to heaven and if they raised up they'd be in a old amirite they die and go to hell so he done him a favor and only asked you one point what is the age of accountability that was my point there Wednesday night what is the age of accountability you realize if that Jew has no understanding or that Gentile or anybody that he's earnest at back in the jungle Aborigine or that person that knows nothing about God has he ever reached the age of accountability I'll leave that question with you accountability is the ability to know the difference between right and wrong that right accountability is the ability to know the difference between right and wrong does that person that there's never heard don't give he's 80 years old what about a child that what about a person that has a mental ability that cuts them all until the 50 years old and they finally realize right and wrong you know they they haven't reached the age of accountability at that time you don't think but listen one last point and then we'll end you okay emphasize one thing that people back there when Adam and Eve sinned that put every person in the world under that condemnation you agree that's why you got to be born again because you're under that content that point of saying don't eat of the tree of knowledge it's still here today Paul said in second Corinthians I'm scared of you unless the serpent through his subtilty be call you like he did Eve now that's the point that I want to bring to make sure you understand you understand one time we're born again believers Adam and Eve had eternal life in their soul they did not go to hell when they were unbelief and and went down they just went to the grave you realize me you going to the grave as long as that unbelief is still higher as long as you've gotten play around and taught values run around he said to sympathize with something I don't believe that to soul doctor and brother Dale but I sure like to be around them because they bright I don't believe in short old money but but he does a good job preaching could you be sympathetic and could you get that spirit on you that's on that other person oh no remember you still under the curse of the fall until these bodies are changed and takes our spirit being changed we're dying the reason we're dying what is the reason we're dying unbelief unbelief in God which is the word yeah but I don't know it's not no one believe I don't either but I'll keep preaching till I find out it in Unitas when I find it I'll nail it and I hit it and I hollered scream about it to disbelieve God's Word come on brothers to disbelieve God's Word is death I don't care whether you're Jew Gentile of who you are to just believe God's Word is death that's why we're still dying don't blame God we're dying because we don't believe what I believe everything Brazil I believe everything bread around talk about these fellers has been around 40 years preaching that and where are they today come on where are they today they're preaching now that brother Branham was wrong and run around with this brother Ron was out the ones that used to preach and swear by his message is being true you know why cuz we're still just a little bit nibbling off of that wrong tree I'm saved because I didn't do so and so well what about that person that never heard about it and they done it you realize today that under some of the laws of the nations around the world polygamy is okay right now they're gonna be judged by polygamy where they're gonna be judged by you don't think I'm sorry my computer goes all the time what time this runs out and overheats everything the book but sometimes it comes out with a thought that is good what about a God is so compassionate he's going to keep his word but his word declares he'll say that heathen that has the right nature now those are the wrong nature he won't save them but I said about Adolf Hitler and his early life he had to write nature when his later life he turned to the wrong nature he's not that two-hour journey through life this time think on these things what a gospel to the heathen go ahead read they take and get life they can be given life this evening time it's later than anybody have an eco
