[14:52] this
[14:53] morning I've got a I want to share a few
[14:56] things with you this morning that's been
[14:59] on my heart and
[15:03] uh
[15:05] well first off I just want to take a
[15:07] couple minutes first off the the couple
[15:09] that we were praying for the young Kon
[15:11] and Lindsay the young that were that was
[15:14] in the car accident and Lindsay was in a
[15:17] coma where where she's awake this
[15:20] morning she opened her eyes the other
[15:22] day and was able to look around and and
[15:25] she recognized some people and so she's
[15:27] doing a lot better than this morning
[15:29] just continue to pray for them and
[15:31] Canon he's I guess they've done some
[15:34] procedure or something on him and to
[15:36] help with his uh spinal fluid leaking
[15:40] and so he's doing better this morning
[15:41] but he's still in a lot of pain so y'all
[15:44] continue to pray for him but thank the
[15:45] Lord he they're doing a lot better this
[15:47] morning thank you Lord it was just the
[15:49] hand of the Lord they were actually able
[15:50] to survive what they went through and so
[15:53] I just thank the Lord this morning just
[15:54] want to give you that up update I didn't
[15:56] wasn't able to put it out but um I know
[15:59] brother Ryan was mentioning that this
[16:02] morning
[16:02] and also wanted to say this morning that
[16:06] if y'all if y don't remember this
[16:08] supposed to be our the last service that
[16:10] brother Zach sister Lily is going to be
[16:11] with us and uh we want to say God bless
[16:16] them we're going to really miss them
[16:18] amen and uh I was thinking
[16:22] about Zach coming up here and helping
[16:24] brother Terrence do the prair re Quest
[16:26] when he was little standing on that
[16:28] little St up
[16:31] here and they come up here and went
[16:33] doing you service and they had the stool
[16:35] up here and they two of them be up here
[16:37] leading singing and he's growing up to
[16:39] be a fine young
[16:42] man
[16:45] am so God bless them and sister Lily
[16:50] taught me one thing in this world and
[16:52] she told me to uh lower my expectations
[16:54] so I carry that with me wherever I
[16:57] go
[17:00] I was kidding her one time after I
[17:02] preached and and uh I said well
[17:04] everybody else said I done a good job
[17:06] she didn't say nothing and she said well
[17:07] you just need laal expectation
[17:11] so so that's that's the one thing I got
[17:13] from sister Lily so but I appreciate
[17:16] them they they're a wonderful couple and
[17:18] really God bless them in your journey
[17:20] and everywhere you

[21:54] of the brothers comment this morning
[21:55] about so sometimes how when you're
[21:58] talking to somebody when when people are
[21:59] listening they're actually not listening
[22:01] they're thinking about what they're
[22:02] going to say well that that this

[22:21] said everybody around me would be
[22:23] getting sick pneumonia whatever else and
[22:26] he said I never never happens to me and
[22:29] and and I was joking with the brother
[22:31] and I thought he knew I was joking but I
[22:33] said well brother you you do realize
[22:35] there is a rare condition that only a
[22:37] few people are born with where they have
[22:39] more bone density or their skull is
[22:42] thicker than the average
[22:44] person and I said it works like
[22:46] insulation so they're they don't they
[22:49] don't get cold and and I was winking
[22:52] when I was saying it and and his
[22:54] brother-in-law was was in the room with

[31:07] 13 I apologize for the way my voice
[31:10] sounds this morning I'm getting over
[31:12] some congestion and things and
[31:15] um I've got something that's contagious
[31:18] this morning but it's not the flu or Co
[31:21] or the cold it's it's something uh fire
[31:25] burning in my heart and I hope it
[31:27] spreads and I believe you come with fire
[31:29] burden in your heart this morning too
[31:31] and so um just before we read his word
[31:34] let's go to him in prayer once more
[31:37] Heavenly Father Lord what a what a
[31:40] wonderful realization to know Lord that
[31:44] when you hung there on
[31:46] Calvary Lord you you
[31:48] saw the crowd you saw those that were
[31:52] mocking you and jering and making fun
[31:55] Lord but you weren't focused on on them
[31:58] and Lord you the true reality is Lord
[32:02] you you you didn't die for the sins of
[32:05] the world but Lord that you died for my
[32:08] sins it was me that you saw Lord thank
[32:11] you Lord it was me that you looked upon
[32:13] and the condition I was in and Lord you
[32:17] you went there and suffered and endured
[32:20] all of that father God for my salvation
[32:23] my healing my Redemption father to be re
[32:27] restored Lord and replaced thank you
[32:30] Lord Lord as one of your children and
[32:33] Lord with that in mind that that is
[32:35] really what brings us here today in
[32:39] honor of the
[32:40] Resurrection because Lord that life has
[32:43] been resurrected within us and it brings
[32:46] us here to worship you this morning Lord
[32:49] to acknowledge that you are our God you
[32:52] are our savior you are our Salvation you
[32:57] you are our healing Lord you uh we are
[33:00] so insufficient Lord and we are we we
[33:04] fall so short but Lord you are our
[33:07] sufficiency and Lord we ask you this
[33:10] morning to make that a greater
[33:12] realization to each of us and as we look
[33:15] into your word may you come Lord and do
[33:18] what only you can do and that is make
[33:22] the word come alive to us father Lord
[33:25] may it come in and Minister Lord our
[33:28] needs Lord are perhaps as scattered and
[33:33] as diverse as the East is from the west
[33:36] but in your word Lord the answers are
[33:39] present and Lord you you have a way of
[33:43] ministering your word in a way that will
[33:45] meet each and every need and we ask you
[33:47] to do that and we pray Lord for these
[33:50] who are gathered here today and we also
[33:51] pray Lord for brother Wade Lord for
[33:55] brother Samuel Dell and for his family
[33:58] Lord and we thank you for the work that
[34:00] is ongoing Lord that uh brother brother
[34:04] Samuel didn't start but you started it
[34:06] Lord and you're going to take it on and
[34:09] we thank you for that Lord we're a part
[34:11] of that and we we just ask you Lord to
[34:15] have the preeminence in our gathering
[34:17] here today in Jesus Christ's name we ask
[34:20] it amen amen I want to speak on the
[34:23] prevailing power of Revelation this
[34:26] morning morning let's read in Matthew
[34:28] chap 16 beginning at verse 13 when Jesus
[34:32] came into the coast of sis uh cesaria
[34:37] Philippi he asked his disciples saying
[34:40] whom do men say that I the son of man am
[34:44] and they said some say that thou art
[34:46] John the Baptist some Elias or others
[34:49] jeremias or one of the prophets and he
[34:52] saith unto them but whom say ye that I
[34:55] am and Simon Peter answered and said
[34:59] Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[35:02] Living God and Jesus answered and said
[35:05] unto him blessed art thou Simon barjona
[35:09] for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it
[35:12] unto thee but my Father which is in
[35:15] heaven and I say also unto thee that
[35:18] thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will
[35:22] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[35:25] shall not Prevail against it and I will
[35:30] give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom
[35:33] and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth
[35:36] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[35:38] Thou shalt loose on Earth shall be
[35:41] loosed in heaven may the Lord bless the
[35:44] reading of his word and you may be
[35:46] seated this morning now I I
[35:51] believe this message I have preached
[35:54] numerous times and perhaps I've preached
[35:57] it here before I don't know but it it is
[36:00] what the Lord moved upon my heart to to
[36:03] minister this morning and I I know that
[36:06] y'all are a blessed group of people to
[36:08] have a wonderful ministry here and and
[36:12] not only brother Samuel but brother Wade
[36:14] and brother Bob and and I'm I'm sure I'm
[36:17] overlooking but and you believe in the
[36:20] five-fold ministry and you believe in
[36:22] the ministry of God's prophet and it did
[36:24] my heart good to come in and hear his
[36:26] voice voice uh this morning as you were
[36:29] here in attention to that and so um uh I
[36:34] just I'm not here to tell you anything
[36:36] you haven't heard before but I'm just
[36:39] here to yield myself to the Lord that he
[36:41] could speak and so we realize uh the
[36:45] church is built on Revelation and every
[36:49] individual member that makes up that
[36:52] church or that body or the bride is
[36:55] built on re Revelation amen so and and
[36:59] it's not only the foundation now
[37:01] sometimes we think of a foundation as
[37:04] being something Elementary or being
[37:06] something you know that that we maybe
[37:09] Advance Beyond but uh Revelation is not
[37:13] just the foundation but it is the
[37:17] basis it is the basis that the church is
[37:20] built on and it's the basis that every
[37:23] member and every person who makes up the
[37:26] church is built on so God didn't build
[37:29] his church on an
[37:31] emotion Revelation is not a feeling it
[37:34] can produce an emotion it can produce a
[37:37] feeling we realize there's stimulation
[37:39] of Revelation but what God built his
[37:42] church on is not just a feeling amen but
[37:46] it and it's not a
[37:48] membership uh Christ Church is not a
[37:50] church you can join it's not a church
[37:53] you can uh be uh become worthy enough to
[37:58] enter you can't earn your way into it
[38:00] you can't work your way into it it's not
[38:02] something you deserve amen but it's it's
[38:06] it's and it's not based you know if it
[38:08] if this were a country club you know
[38:11] then you you could buy a membership or
[38:14] you could know somebody or you could be
[38:16] born into a family like royalty royalty
[38:19] is based on lineage right amen but this
[38:23] is not a natural lineage it is a
[38:25] spiritual lineage
[38:27] it is the faith Seed of Abraham amen so
[38:30] it it and that when that is is revealed
[38:33] to you then you are you are born into
[38:36] the body of Christ or in this church and
[38:39] so um I'm just trying to get a little
[38:41] bit of a foundation late here this
[38:43] morning but every Born Again believer is
[38:47] brought into the
[38:49] revelation of who Jesus Christ
[38:53] is not necessarily who he was was or who
[38:57] he's going to be but who Jesus Christ is
[39:02] because Jesus Christ is alive today amen
[39:05] now he is not in a nail scarred body
[39:08] revealing himself to the world in that
[39:11] form but he is here in the form of the
[39:14] revealed word and that revealed word is
[39:17] Incarnate in a body of people amen that
[39:21] have also come have been incepted if you
[39:24] will into this great mystical body of
[39:26] the Lord or the Church of the Living God
[39:29] and that's who we are a part of amen and
[39:32] so I want to read a quote this morning
[39:35] um from the revelation of Jesus Christ
[39:39] and I know you've heard this before I
[39:40] know I'm not it's nothing new but it's
[39:43] it's kind of builds the basis and and
[39:45] the prophet of God says now the Greek
[39:47] word for Revelation is apocalypse which
[39:51] means unveiling this unveiling is
[39:54] perfectly described in the example of a
[39:57] sculptor unveiling his work of Statuary
[40:01] exposing it to the onlooker it is an
[40:05] uncovering revealing what was previously
[40:10] hidden now the uncovery is not only the
[40:14] revelation of the person of Christ come
[40:18] on this is key it's not only the
[40:21] revelation of the person of Christ but
[40:24] it is the revelation of his Future
[40:27] Works in the oncoming seven Church
[40:31] ages now it is the person of Christ but
[40:36] it is again it's not the nail scarred
[40:38] body of the man
[40:40] Jesus it is revealing what his spirit is
[40:44] going to do in an Earthly body as it
[40:48] operates through the next seven periods
[40:51] or the next ages known as the seven
[40:54] Church ages amen so the I'm go I'm
[40:57] continuing on here he says the
[40:59] importance of Revelation by the spirit
[41:02] to a True Believer can never be
[41:08] overemphasized Revelation means more to
[41:11] you than perhaps you realize now I am
[41:13] not talking about this book of
[41:15] Revelation and you I am talking about
[41:18] all
[41:19] Revelation it is tremendously important
[41:23] to the church do you remember in Matthew
[41:26] 16 where Jesus asked the disciples this
[41:29] question whom do men say that I am and
[41:31] they said some say thou art John the
[41:33] Baptist some Elias others Jeremiah are
[41:36] one of the prophets he saith unto them
[41:38] but whom say ye that I am you see the
[41:40] question has to come to the individual
[41:44] God doesn't care about what the world
[41:45] thinks he he's not taking an opinion
[41:48] poll this morning he's coming to you
[41:51] he's coming to the individual do you
[41:54] know who I am amen and and he so uh he
[41:57] said but whom say ye that I am and Simon
[42:00] Peter answered and said Thou Art the
[42:04] Christ now that in itself is a
[42:06] revelation that he is one Thou Art the
[42:10] Christ the son this is exclusive the son
[42:15] of the Living God and Jesus answered and
[42:18] said unto him blessed art thou Simon
[42:20] Baroda for Flesh and Blood hath not
[42:23] revealed it unto thee in other words
[42:25] what Jesus was telling him him in
[42:27] essence is I didn't as a person I didn't
[42:31] give this to you right as a man standing
[42:35] here in a body of Flesh I didn't give
[42:37] this to you but it was revealed to you
[42:41] by the father by the spirit of God
[42:45] quickening this to your understanding
[42:48] amen Upon This Rock Amen my my father
[42:52] has revealed it unto thee and I and let
[42:55] me find my place place here uh Flesh and
[42:58] Blood ha not revealed it unto thee but
[43:01] my Father which is in heaven you see
[43:04] this has to be a basis this has to be a
[43:08] foundation amen that will operate that
[43:12] will work even when Jesus is not here in
[43:16] a body of Flesh because it's how he's
[43:19] going to build his entire church over
[43:21] the next 2,000 years amen so it's
[43:24] Revelation by the spirit Spirit to the
[43:27] individual believer amen amen Upon This
[43:33] Rock oh no sorry I'm getting ahead of
[43:35] myself and I say unto thee that thou art
[43:38] Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my
[43:40] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[43:43] Prevail against it so in other words you
[43:46] come to the realization of who you are
[43:49] as a part of the church when you realize
[43:52] who he
[43:53] is amen Peter could not be placed as a
[43:57] stone in the pyramid until he realized
[44:00] who Christ was amen and when he did then
[44:04] Jesus said and thou art Peter and Upon
[44:07] This Rock I will build my church amen
[44:10] and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[44:12] against it now brother Bram says the
[44:14] Roman
[44:15] Catholics so brother Bram is telling us
[44:17] what the Catholics teach the Roman
[44:20] Catholics say that the church is built
[44:23] upon
[44:25] Peter why would the Roman Catholic
[44:27] Church say that because it's how their
[44:29] church is
[44:30] built on a man on a man's teachings or
[44:35] on how he interprets the word and it
[44:38] changes every time the pope
[44:41] changes so they built their Church on a
[44:44] man but God didn't build his on a man
[44:48] amen the Roman Catholics say that the
[44:51] church is built upon Peter now that is
[44:53] really carnal how could God build the
[44:57] church Upon A man so unstable that he
[45:00] denied the Lord Jesus and cursed while
[45:02] doing it God can't build his church upon
[45:07] any man born in sin and it wasn't some
[45:11] rock lying there as though God had
[45:14] hallowed the ground at that spot amen
[45:17] it's not built in Jerusalem it's not
[45:20] built in Lula it's not built in Newton
[45:22] North Carolina it's not built in
[45:24] Jeffersonville it's not built in a place
[45:27] amen it's placing the individual in
[45:32] Christ you see amen it wasn't some rock
[45:36] line there as though God had hallowed
[45:39] the ground at that spot and it isn't as
[45:43] the Protestants say that the church is
[45:45] built upon Jesus there's a
[45:49] shocker the church isn't built on Jesus
[45:52] brother
[45:53] Tim read on listen
[45:58] on I got you listening now don't
[46:02] you it isn't as the Protestants say that
[46:05] the church is built upon Jesus it was
[46:07] the
[46:08] Revelation read it the way it is written
[46:11] Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it but
[46:14] my father hath revealed it and Upon This
[46:17] Rock Revelation I will build my church
[46:22] the church is built on Revelation Amen
[46:26] on thus saith the Lord I'm just going to
[46:31] break here for just a moment to say
[46:33] God's spoken word is his most powerful
[46:37] form of
[46:39] expression it's how he
[46:41] creates it's how he controls it's how he
[46:44] changes amen so the the Church of God is
[46:47] the spoken word of God Amen brought into
[46:51] manifestation and the spoken word of God
[46:54] is omnipotent
[46:57] it is all powerful now when we talk
[46:59] about prevailing the prevailing power of
[47:02] Revelation the very term prevailing
[47:05] shows that there is conflict it shows
[47:08] that there are at least two forces or
[47:11] two Powers at work but one
[47:15] prevails amen it shows that there is
[47:18] opposition it shows that there is
[47:21] adversity it shows that there is
[47:23] something trying to Hinder stop or block
[47:27] but the Revelation has prevailing power
[47:31] it is
[47:32] sueme it is superior amen it will
[47:36] overcome all obstacles it will overcome
[47:39] every challenge amen it there is nothing
[47:42] that can stop it the Revelation amen is
[47:47] Invincible amen it it is it is
[47:49] omnipotent it there it is
[47:52] undefeatable and so I want you to
[47:54] realize this this morning friends you
[47:56] are part of the Revelation amen you are
[47:59] involved in this Revelation it's still
[48:02] ongoing this morning Amen in 2023 the
[48:06] revelation of Jesus Christ is still
[48:09] unfolding it has never stopped and it is
[48:12] an eternal Revelation it will
[48:14] continually be unfolding itself through
[48:16] the ceaseless ages of Eternity amen so
[48:20] you are part of that this morning and uh
[48:23] I'm just going to go through a few
[48:24] examples here in Daniel chapter 10 we
[48:28] read and and I'm maybe the brothers are
[48:30] going to bring this up on the screen but
[48:32] I'm going to just bring you a few
[48:33] illustrations and if we get too close to
[48:35] lunchtime we'll just stop and put a hit
[48:38] the pause button and come back in the
[48:39] afternoon amen but but I I I pray that
[48:43] this will help you Amen in your
[48:45] Christian Journey because this involves
[48:48] you amen uh God has never stopped
[48:51] building his church and it's still
[48:53] ongoing today amen there there are still
[48:56] uh new new uh sons and daughters being
[48:59] brought into it and not only are they
[49:01] being brought in but the ones who have
[49:03] been born into the church are coming to
[49:05] a greater understanding of their
[49:09] position in Christ amen and so that will
[49:12] one day bring Rapture I believe that
[49:14] that will be the culmination of that and
[49:17] so I I um I believe we're reading from
[49:19] Daniel chapter 10 here Daniel was a
[49:22] prophet we know that and he was also in
[49:24] Babylonian cap
[49:26] captivity and he says here in the third
[49:28] year of Cyrus King of Persia a thing was
[49:31] revealed unto Daniel whose name was
[49:33] called belto Shazer and the thing was
[49:35] true but the time appointed was long and
[49:39] he understood the thing and he had
[49:42] understanding of the vision in those
[49:44] days I Daniel was mourning three full
[49:47] weeks I ate no Pleasant bread neither
[49:50] came flesh nor wine in my mouth neither
[49:52] did I anoint myself at all till three
[49:54] whole weeks were fulfilled and in the 4
[49:56] and 20th day of the first month as I was
[49:59] by the side of the Great River which is
[50:01] hle then I lifted up mine eyes and
[50:04] looked and behold a certain man clothed
[50:06] in linen whose loins were girded with
[50:08] the fine gold of euphas his his and he
[50:11] goes on I'm going to skip down here just
[50:13] a bit
[50:16] um Let me let me move down for the sake
[50:18] of time to verse 11 and he said unto me
[50:22] oh Daniel a man great
[50:27] beloved understand the words that I
[50:31] speak unto thee and stand
[50:35] upright the Revelation was going to
[50:37] change his position
[50:41] amen it's
[50:43] powerful and stand upright For unto thee
[50:47] see it's
[50:49] personal friends what God has done in
[50:53] this hour is personal
[50:56] amen it should be personal to each and
[50:59] every one of us and we shouldn't be able
[51:02] to distance
[51:04] ourselves we should not try to distance
[51:08] ourselves from what God has done in this
[51:12] hour I God have mercy on me here and I
[51:15] pray I won't be misunderstood but I hear
[51:17] Ministries sometimes that almost
[51:18] classify message people as a different
[51:22] category of people and I'm thinking well
[51:23] what are
[51:24] you aren't you one of us I am a message
[51:29] people I'm a
[51:31] bromite by the world's definition of
[51:34] what a bromite is absolutely I'm a
[51:37] believer of this message I believe
[51:39] William Brenham was the Fulfillment of
[51:41] Malachi 4 St Luke 17:30 Revelation 10:7
[51:46] absolutely it's personal and when it is
[51:48] an attacked it is personal brother B
[51:51] said anything that comes against this
[51:52] word is your enemy and Satan is
[51:55] attacking this word so you should take
[51:58] it personally but you should take it
[52:01] personally take the message personally
[52:04] William bradam is your Prophet this is
[52:07] your message amen now I'm straying off
[52:10] my notes here but I'm saying what God
[52:11] has put on my heart the Jubilee trumpet
[52:14] wasn't for everybody but it was for
[52:17] Israelites it was for Hebrews it was an
[52:21] it was an uncertain sound to the world
[52:23] but to a Hebrew who who had been in
[52:26] slavery it was a welcome sound because
[52:29] there was laws that pertained to him
[52:32] that when the Jubilee trumpet sounded
[52:35] meant he was free from the other laws
[52:38] that had placed him in bondage so this
[52:41] message is a unique sound that catches
[52:44] the hearts of a unique people amen who
[52:48] are being called out of church C out of
[52:51] tradition C out of protestantism and
[52:54] Catholicism ISM and denominationalism
[52:57] and has called them into
[53:00] Christ and it is
[53:02] personal absolutely it's personal amen I
[53:06] am come to
[53:08] thee
[53:10] Daniel the words that I speak unto thee
[53:12] For unto thee am I sent and when he
[53:16] spoke when he had spoken this word unto
[53:18] me I stood trembling and he said unto me
[53:20] fear not Daniel for from the first day
[53:23] that thou did set thine heart to
[53:24] understand and to chasen thyself before
[53:26] thy God thy words were
[53:29] heard and I am come amen for thy words
[53:34] amen but the prince of the kingdom of
[53:36] Persia withstood me one in 20 days but
[53:39] Lo Michael one of the chief princes came
[53:43] to help me and I remained there with the
[53:46] kings of Persia now am I come to make
[53:49] the understand what shall befall thy
[53:52] people in the latter days for yet the
[53:54] vision is for many many days now the
[53:56] reason I I brought all of that is to
[53:59] show you Satan hates
[54:01] Revelation how many he hates it amen it
[54:04] it is Public Enemy Number One to the
[54:08] Devil Revelation by the spirit to the
[54:12] individual will absolutely bind Satan
[54:17] completely that's right and and I just
[54:19] bring this as a as a little
[54:22] dramatization Satan had his demons go
[54:25] all throughout the regions of the earth
[54:28] doing all the things demons
[54:30] do trying to kill steal and destroy
[54:34] trying to convince people to rob steal
[54:37] uh Gossip murder commit adultery commit
[54:41] suicide spirits of Oppression depression
[54:45] anxiety all of these things that's what
[54:47] demon Spirits do that's what evil
[54:49] spirits do they divide families they
[54:51] split churches uh they they they you
[54:54] know they break up homes they do all of
[54:56] these things that's just what evil
[54:58] spirits do so Satan had his evil spirits
[55:03] roaming to and fro through the Earth
[55:05] doing all the things they do and and I
[55:07] just dramatize it this way when Daniel
[55:09] began praying for
[55:11] Revelation Satan hit a big red
[55:14] button in the control tower of Hell in
[55:19] the control center he hits a red button
[55:22] it's the first time this has ever
[55:23] happened but this button sends out a a
[55:26] signal and and and and the pagers if you
[55:30] will of every demon throughout every
[55:32] area of the world go off say come back
[55:34] to Hell
[55:35] immediately come back to the
[55:38] headquarters something has happened
[55:40] abort your mission and return to the
[55:43] headquarters so you know the Slackers
[55:46] they're just right on the they were
[55:48] barely outside the gate anyway they come
[55:50] in and but you know some have been on
[55:52] assignments quite a distance and so they
[55:54] they all come in and they all sit down
[55:56] and they're grabbing coffee and they're
[55:58] kind of getting freshened up and they're
[55:59] waiting to hear why has Satan called us
[56:03] here today what has happened you know
[56:05] they're they're kind of nervous and
[56:07] they're sitting there in all the history
[56:09] of time this has never happened and so
[56:11] there there you know and and what it's
[56:14] my you know I was I had worked for
[56:17] months trying to break up this home and
[56:20] and or this church and and and and I had
[56:23] someone on the verge of suicide and and
[56:26] you know all of these things and they're
[56:27] all you know kind of giving their their
[56:29] account of what what they were doing
[56:31] when when their pedras went off and so
[56:34] Satan finally the last one comes in and
[56:36] and Satan clears his throat and he says
[56:38] now you're probably all wondering why I
[56:40] called you here now he said but I I'm
[56:43] I'm going to tell you I'm going to give
[56:45] you the announcement the Prophet
[56:48] Daniel is kneeling by the river
[56:52] hle and he's praying for for
[56:57] Revelation and and uh one of the Demons
[57:00] about 3/4 of the way back said um
[57:02] Lucifer could you say that again I'm not
[57:04] sure I heard you
[57:06] correctly he said I said the Prophet
[57:10] Daniel is praying for
[57:17] Revelation and Buddy they get you
[57:19] talking about getting worked up now
[57:21] demons they're easily
[57:23] angered as it is now they're getting
[57:25] worked up now wait a minute I I had a
[57:27] man about to rob a
[57:28] bank I I I I had a man about ready to
[57:31] leave his wife and family and go commit
[57:33] adultery I had a church about to ready
[57:36] to split you know they they had what
[57:38] they thought were important assignments
[57:41] and they
[57:42] were it's what demons do and some of
[57:44] them are really good at what they do I
[57:46] mean there's there're senior demons they
[57:48] they demons are ranked you
[57:51] know and so they they're sitting here
[57:53] say you mean you mean to tell me you got
[57:57] me to abort the mission I was on just to
[58:01] come back here and tell me that the
[58:04] Prophet Daniel is praying for
[58:07] Revelation what's the big
[58:09] deal why would that be anything special
[58:14] why would that cause this this to happen
[58:16] why why would this cause this
[58:18] unprecedented event you know what's
[58:20] going on and Satan said well that's why
[58:22] I'm Lucifer and you're an apprentice
[58:26] that's why I'm the chief demon and
[58:27] you're just an upand coming demon let me
[58:29] tell you something if this Revelation
[58:33] ever reaches that prophet and that
[58:36] Prophet ever preaches this Revelation
[58:38] and that Revelation ever reaches those
[58:41] people and the spirit of God ever
[58:43] quickens to them who they are and where
[58:47] they are in the prophecy and what the
[58:49] word of God is and who they are all your
[58:53] efforts to make them still cheat lie
[58:56] commit adultery amen uh all the all the
[59:00] anxiety all the depression all of those
[59:02] other things you will be
[59:09] powerless yes
[59:14] sir Satan will be powerless against her
[59:19] I was looking for the quote you know
[59:20] what I'm talking about you will gain
[59:24] invincible
[59:25] ability that's right when the
[59:28] Revelation strikes you of who you are
[59:33] what you stand for and Discerning the
[59:35] two Spirits operating within the
[59:37] framework of the Christian church when
[59:40] the Revelation strikes you nothing Satan
[59:44] does can defeat
[59:47] it Upon This
[59:51] Rock I will build my church
[59:55] and the Gates of Hell cannot shall not
[1:00:00] Prevail against it
[1:00:04] amen well they tried but they still
[1:00:08] lost because Daniel kept praying you see
[1:00:12] there was a determination within Daniel
[1:00:15] he knew Jeremiah had prophesied 70 years
[1:00:18] and he knew he was right at the end of
[1:00:20] that but he wasn't just happy with kind
[1:00:22] of a generalized idea
[1:00:26] of what the prophet's message and how it
[1:00:29] pertained to him he wanted to know where
[1:00:31] am I he wanted it to be personal brother
[1:00:34] Bob he want to know where am I amen
[1:00:38] where where what is my responsibility
[1:00:40] see each of us are called we each of us
[1:00:43] have a unique
[1:00:45] placing within the body of Christ and
[1:00:48] and your pastor can't tell you what that
[1:00:50] is your parents can't tell you what that
[1:00:52] is there ain't no Deacon or know you've
[1:00:55] got to learn what that is by seeking
[1:00:59] Revelation by seeking God in prayer and
[1:01:02] studying the word of God that's not just
[1:01:05] for ministers to do for it that's for
[1:01:07] every member of the body they are fed by
[1:01:11] the word of God that's how their soul
[1:01:13] are strengthened that's how you gain
[1:01:15] your
[1:01:17] identity as a part of Christ's body is
[1:01:20] by feeding on the word amen and the word
[1:01:23] places you in positioned you within the
[1:01:26] body as a functioning member part of a
[1:01:30] living body here on the earth amen
[1:01:33] hallelujah and and Satan it it it just
[1:01:36] tears his kingdom completely down amen
[1:01:41] so let me find my place here Revelation
[1:01:46] is an
[1:01:48] unveiling it is a uh it is an exposing
[1:01:52] as the prophet of God said and I and I
[1:01:54] I this really struck
[1:01:57] me because in the instance of a
[1:02:01] sculptor he is bringing something out of
[1:02:06] a piece of wood right he's bringing
[1:02:09] something out of a slab of marble or
[1:02:13] granite or stone there's something
[1:02:16] hidden in that
[1:02:18] object that it's his job to
[1:02:23] reveal so it's not just pulling the
[1:02:26] cover off of something that's been
[1:02:28] carved alog together but it is sculpting
[1:02:33] something or in this sense it's
[1:02:36] removing
[1:02:37] everything that's not the
[1:02:42] Revelation so if it's revealing
[1:02:45] Christ it's removing everything that's
[1:02:48] not
[1:02:49] Christ and if it's revealing Christ in
[1:02:52] you the hope of Glory it's removing
[1:02:56] everything that's not Christ in you the
[1:03:00] hope of glory so it the revelation will
[1:03:05] prevail the Revelation is Invincible the
[1:03:08] Revelation is
[1:03:10] Unstoppable the Revelation cannot be
[1:03:12] defeated the Revelation is the
[1:03:15] determination of the sculptor to bring
[1:03:18] out of a formless
[1:03:22] object something with
[1:03:24] Beauty something that reveals the
[1:03:27] character of the sculptor
[1:03:30] himself and he won't stop until the
[1:03:35] Revelation has prevailed he will not
[1:03:38] stop until what was in his mind emerges
[1:03:43] from what to everyone else is a
[1:03:47] mystery and then he makes it known then
[1:03:51] he declares it oh my friend I'm think
[1:03:54] thinking of how John saw the holy city
[1:03:56] the New Jerusalem descending from God
[1:03:58] out of Heaven as a bride prepared for
[1:04:01] her husband amen the bride was the
[1:04:04] Revelation amen of the groom Hallelujah
[1:04:08] described as a city but it wasn't
[1:04:10] Jerusalem amen it was a people
[1:04:13] hallelujah that God had carved out
[1:04:15] through Seven Ages amen by sending a
[1:04:18] message to call the bride out of the
[1:04:20] church to call the bride out of
[1:04:22] denominations so the revelation of
[1:04:24] Christ could
[1:04:26] emerge and could Prevail amen and then
[1:04:29] be
[1:04:31] revealed as the bride the Lamb's
[1:04:35] wife
[1:04:37] Hallelujah the revelation will prevail
[1:04:40] that's where my confidence is this
[1:04:42] morning so there Daniel Prayed until the
[1:04:46] Revelation prevailed there was a
[1:04:49] determination even within Daniel to keep
[1:04:52] praying and until he received
[1:04:55] it
[1:04:57] amen let me uh move to quote number two
[1:05:01] brothers I'm not real good with all
[1:05:04] these uh Powerpoints
[1:05:07] and all these things but
[1:05:11] uh let's
[1:05:13] see is that the one from the breech I
[1:05:16] believe it
[1:05:20] is
[1:05:21] Mercy give me one moment here brother
[1:05:39] sister yes okay I'm G actually
[1:05:43] I'm I'm G save that one for just a
[1:05:45] little
[1:05:50] bit I'm going bring
[1:05:52] you wow my time flies when you're having
[1:05:58] fun yes sir let me just cut loose here
[1:06:01] for a minute
[1:06:02] preach couple of examples of this Peter
[1:06:07] Peter was one of Christ's disciples
[1:06:11] chosen
[1:06:12] disciple um I love Peter because he
[1:06:15] reminds me a lot of myself lot of zeal
[1:06:19] lot of willingness says a lot of things
[1:06:22] you know out of uh just a great desire
[1:06:25] you know but then has sometimes the
[1:06:29] inability to perform the things he
[1:06:32] desires to right but you know with all
[1:06:36] that we see in Peter and so many times
[1:06:39] when he spoke the Lord would have to
[1:06:40] rebuke him or the Lord would have to
[1:06:42] correct him you know or all these things
[1:06:44] so uh but but but he was a chosen
[1:06:49] disciple and so Peter one day the Lord
[1:06:53] spoke to him and he said Peter Satan
[1:06:56] hath desired to have
[1:07:00] you he hath desire to have you I love
[1:07:04] that because it shows Satan didn't
[1:07:06] didn't have them and never
[1:07:07] would but Jesus wanted but this had to
[1:07:10] be revealed to Peter who he belonged to
[1:07:15] and he said Satan hath desired to have
[1:07:17] you but I have prayed for thee and he
[1:07:22] said that thy faith
[1:07:25] fail not because he'd been with Peter
[1:07:28] long enough to know his testimony would
[1:07:30] fail his emotions would fail his natural
[1:07:34] desires would fail but he was going to
[1:07:38] put something in Peter and he was going
[1:07:40] to put uh Peter on something amen that
[1:07:44] would not fail I have prayed for thee
[1:07:47] Peter that thy
[1:07:49] faith your
[1:07:51] Revelation fail not
[1:07:55] oh brother and that's what held Peter
[1:07:58] you see even in St Matthew 16 Peter was
[1:08:01] not converted when he made this
[1:08:03] statement but it was uh it was a down
[1:08:07] payment it was it was an acknowledgment
[1:08:10] amen that there was something there amen
[1:08:14] that was that was anchored in Peter's
[1:08:16] heart that only needed to be quickened
[1:08:19] by the holy
[1:08:20] spirit amen it's what held Peter amen
[1:08:25] when when when Judas walked away and
[1:08:27] forsook the Lord and and U and and and
[1:08:30] and denied him and sold him into to
[1:08:33] crucifixion he betrayed him but it see
[1:08:36] Jud Peter was
[1:08:37] swayed Peter was affected by the same
[1:08:41] circumstances Judas
[1:08:44] was it's not this friends God help me
[1:08:48] we're not
[1:08:51] immune we're not it's not that we don't
[1:08:54] hear the criticism it's not that we
[1:08:57] don't even face the same mind
[1:08:59] battles it it's it's not that we aren't
[1:09:03] affected by the winds but we are
[1:09:08] anchored in the revelation of who Christ
[1:09:11] is Peter did not understand why he
[1:09:13] believed what he believed couldn't even
[1:09:16] write his own name much less explain or
[1:09:18] make sense of it or or satisfy others
[1:09:22] questions
[1:09:24] but something was holding him when he
[1:09:27] could not hold
[1:09:30] himself after Jesus resurrected go tell
[1:09:33] my disciples and
[1:09:36] Peter he had he knew that something had
[1:09:39] been deposited into Peter he knew there
[1:09:42] was representation on the inside of
[1:09:44] Peter that was missing from Judas and
[1:09:47] that's why Judas could betray the Lord
[1:09:49] and then crucify himself he was he was
[1:09:52] the son of apostasy is that right right
[1:09:54] but Peter was built on a rock amen amen
[1:09:58] he he had something there that was
[1:09:59] holding him so after Peter came out of
[1:10:02] the upper room at Pentecost amen then
[1:10:05] the Holy Spirit had
[1:10:07] quickened that and made Peter a part of
[1:10:10] this
[1:10:12] body and what Jesus had said whatsoever
[1:10:15] Thou shalt bind on Earth I'll bind in
[1:10:16] heaven whatsoever you loose on Earth
[1:10:18] I'll loosen Heaven Peter came out of
[1:10:20] that upper room and faced the same
[1:10:22] criticism and the same adversity that he
[1:10:25] had just collapsed against only days
[1:10:30] before I mean they asked the question
[1:10:32] what meth
[1:10:33] this they friends they weren't curious
[1:10:36] they were
[1:10:37] attacking what meth
[1:10:40] this and Peter Peter would have waffled
[1:10:43] only days before Peter would say oh I'm
[1:10:46] my apologies I don't know what I was
[1:10:48] thinking I you just don't don't don't
[1:10:49] pay any attention these this babbling
[1:10:51] and stuff they're out of order don't
[1:10:53] worry about you know just I'm sorry yeah
[1:10:56] that's what Peter would have done only
[1:10:57] 10 days before but this was a different
[1:11:00] Peter this was a quickened Son of God
[1:11:05] who
[1:11:07] immediately invoked
[1:11:09] prophecy these men are not drunk as you
[1:11:12] suppose seeing it is but the third hour
[1:11:15] of the day but this is that that was
[1:11:18] spoken by the prophet Joel in other
[1:11:22] words what you're seeing is prophecy
[1:11:24] manifested what you're seeing as
[1:11:26] prophecy lived amen what was spoken in
[1:11:29] the Old Testament by a prophet is now a
[1:11:32] Living manifested Word in a body of 120
[1:11:37] Believers this is that that was spoken
[1:11:40] by the prophet Joel and and and the Holy
[1:11:42] Spirit confirmed the word with signs and
[1:11:46] wonderings signs and wonderers
[1:11:50] following I can see right now I'm not
[1:11:52] going to finish this this morning but
[1:11:53] that's but but I'm showing you the
[1:11:56] change amen I'm showing you the
[1:11:59] Revelation that is prevailing despite
[1:12:02] Peter's human
[1:12:04] weaknesses the Revelation that is
[1:12:06] prevailing the Revelation that is taking
[1:12:08] Peter's Zeal and Peter's Good Will and
[1:12:11] Peter's desire and actually quickening
[1:12:14] that into something that is unmovable
[1:12:16] unshakable it is steadfast and Peter
[1:12:19] amen who could hardly live for the cause
[1:12:22] before now lived and died for the same
[1:12:26] cause that only days before he had
[1:12:28] walked away from and even denied
[1:12:29] association with amen now friends this
[1:12:33] is what we're built on too amen so my
[1:12:36] other illustration
[1:12:38] here oh my is Paul the the Apostle Paul
[1:12:42] now we know Saul as his as he was
[1:12:45] formerly known was a great student of
[1:12:48] the scriptures a great student of the
[1:12:51] Old Testament a follower of Moses was a
[1:12:53] a disciple if you will he was a a
[1:12:55] Pharisee of the Pharisees you see how he
[1:12:57] gives his his uh his resume there as he
[1:13:01] address the church but uh you know he
[1:13:03] was
[1:13:05] destroying that New Testament Church in
[1:13:08] the name or under the banner of
[1:13:11] believing a prophet's
[1:13:13] message
[1:13:16] Moses he was a follower of Moses he was
[1:13:18] a believer of the prophet's
[1:13:21] message but he was waiting for a coming
[1:13:25] Prophet that Moses had foretold Moses
[1:13:28] the Lord thy God shall raise up a
[1:13:30] prophet liken unto me him shall you hear
[1:13:33] and Peter had missed
[1:13:35] that
[1:13:36] friends how many today are clinging to a
[1:13:40] prophet's message failing to realize
[1:13:44] what he
[1:13:50] introduced they're clinging to the man
[1:13:53] they're clinging to his
[1:13:55] statements but they're lacking
[1:14:00] Revelation revelation will Quicken the
[1:14:03] message into the person that the message
[1:14:06] came to make
[1:14:07] possible or that the message came to
[1:14:11] unveil amen this message didn't just
[1:14:14] unveil a prophet to us right this
[1:14:17] message unveiled a bride this message
[1:14:19] unveiled a people a bride has emerged Ed
[1:14:24] as a result of this message it's
[1:14:26] ezekiel's valley of dry bones can these
[1:14:28] bones live again
[1:14:30] prophesy the prophecy called the bones
[1:14:34] back to their original order and they
[1:14:36] stood up a living marching Army the
[1:14:38] message is this is the word of God it's
[1:14:41] the signal going out to to capture those
[1:14:45] amen whose ears are
[1:14:47] tuned he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:14:52] what the spirit Spirit saith and when
[1:14:55] your tuned ear and your tuned heart
[1:14:58] catches that signal it quickens you and
[1:15:01] it brings you into the image of who the
[1:15:04] message unveiled to us which is the
[1:15:07] person of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and it
[1:15:11] transforms you into his image and all
[1:15:14] that he is where all that you were Fades
[1:15:18] or is sculpted away so all that is left
[1:15:22] is Christ amen hallelujah so Paul going
[1:15:26] along we know how he was doing
[1:15:27] destroying the church uh committing them
[1:15:29] to death and all those things but one
[1:15:32] day he met the person of the
[1:15:34] word that was the difference he knew the
[1:15:36] word but he only had a carnal he only
[1:15:39] had an intellectual understanding and
[1:15:42] that's good but it's not
[1:15:44] enough right mechanics are good but you
[1:15:47] need Dynamics to make the mechanics move
[1:15:51] it takes Dynamics to unleash the
[1:15:54] potential that's in the
[1:15:56] mechanics amen so one day he met the
[1:15:58] person of the in the form of the pillar
[1:16:00] of fire Paul knew the word
[1:16:02] intellectually but he never met him
[1:16:04] personally in Revelation but on the road
[1:16:07] to Damascus he met the Lord and he
[1:16:10] opened his understanding to his present
[1:16:14] day
[1:16:16] form or
[1:16:18] expression I am
[1:16:21] Jesus who whom thou persecutest I know
[1:16:25] I've preached this here before but it's
[1:16:27] worth saying again Paul never met the
[1:16:30] nail scarred body of
[1:16:33] Jesus and he never persecuted the nail
[1:16:37] scarred body of Jesus but this voice
[1:16:39] said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest
[1:16:43] showing that Jesus form had
[1:16:46] changed from a Galilean to 120 believers
[1:16:51] who had received his very life his very
[1:16:54] spirit and had been sculpted into the
[1:16:56] image of Jesus Christ and when Saul
[1:16:58] persecuted the
[1:17:00] church he was
[1:17:02] persecuting the redeemed
[1:17:05] Body of Christ you see it this
[1:17:09] morning and but the revelation will
[1:17:13] prevail the revelation will prevail Saul
[1:17:16] had a carnal he had an intellectual he
[1:17:19] had a mental understanding but he was
[1:17:21] needing revelation he was needing
[1:17:23] something to Quicken you see friends
[1:17:25] Revelation doesn't just stimulate your
[1:17:28] thinking on listen to this it doesn't
[1:17:31] just stimulate your thinking but it
[1:17:33] literally brings you
[1:17:36] into the expressed thought of God it
[1:17:39] makes you it births you it quickens you
[1:17:42] into it so that God's very ideas become
[1:17:46] active through your life that's right
[1:17:49] and that is the Revelation the
[1:17:51] Revelation is when it lives itself
[1:17:54] through you so you're now not just
[1:17:56] quoting the word you're actually living
[1:17:58] the word you're expressing the word the
[1:18:01] word is is is resounding through your
[1:18:06] life and it is Invincible it is
[1:18:11] Unstoppable there's nothing the devil
[1:18:13] can do to defeat it so Paul met Jesus he
[1:18:18] did meet Jesus I am Jesus that's right
[1:18:22] whom
[1:18:23] persecuted but not in an elard
[1:18:26] body he met him in a redeemed
[1:18:29] body and then when the Holy Spirit
[1:18:33] quickened him
[1:18:35] Saul he gave
[1:18:38] Saul his ministry as an
[1:18:41] apostle a prophet to the
[1:18:44] Gentiles to show the mysteries of God to
[1:18:47] the
[1:18:49] church Saul or Paul preached the
[1:18:53] mysteries in a way that even made
[1:18:56] Peter
[1:18:59] Marvel and Peter knew Christ in the
[1:19:01] flesh right but it wasn't Peter's
[1:19:04] placing or it wasn't Peter's
[1:19:07] position to hold the office that Paul
[1:19:11] held Paul held an office as a prophet
[1:19:14] amen so a prophet is a Divine
[1:19:17] interpreter or Divine revealer of the
[1:19:20] word so then Paul began to expound these
[1:19:24] Mysteries of the kingdom of God and how
[1:19:27] the grace of God had enlarged Beyond a
[1:19:30] natural lineage of Abraham's seed into
[1:19:33] the faith Seed of Abraham Jesus Christ
[1:19:36] amen and I love this Revelation breaks
[1:19:40] boundaries Revelation breaks boundaries
[1:19:43] it breaks geographical boundaries it
[1:19:45] breaks ethnical boundaries amen it
[1:19:47] doesn't create differentiation between
[1:19:50] black and white and yellow and brown
[1:19:52] amen but it shows amen it transcends
[1:19:54] natural Bloodlines it transcends all of
[1:19:57] those things because what is it doing
[1:19:59] it's Gathering a body it's Gathering the
[1:20:01] body of Jesus Christ amen it's a
[1:20:04] mystical Union Hallelujah it is a
[1:20:06] mystical body that the word of God is
[1:20:09] calling out
[1:20:10] to to bring them back remember
[1:20:14] Redemption brings back
[1:20:16] friend brings them back to their
[1:20:19] original
[1:20:21] state as sons of and Daughters of God
[1:20:23] the expressed his expressed attributes
[1:20:26] his thoughts manifested here on the
[1:20:29] earth you believe that this
[1:20:31] morning
[1:20:33] amen so maybe I will get
[1:20:37] done maybe I will get done we'll just
[1:20:40] touch on this and maybe this even we'll
[1:20:42] just come back and bounce back over it
[1:20:44] just a little bit I don't know that's
[1:20:45] the thing friends sometimes a minister
[1:20:47] is just as mystified by What God Says as
[1:20:50] you
[1:20:51] are amen because we come up here with
[1:20:53] what we think we're going to say and
[1:20:54] then he starts talking and we're like my
[1:20:56] that was wonderful amen but I want I
[1:20:59] want to show you I've shown you Daniel
[1:21:01] I've shown you Peter I've shown you Paul
[1:21:03] and now I want to show you our
[1:21:05] type John the Revelator or St John the
[1:21:09] Divine amen let's read in the Book of
[1:21:12] Revelation chapter 5 and um you know I
[1:21:17] you go places to preach and you think my
[1:21:19] Lord why would you have me preach that
[1:21:20] again I've preached that there before
[1:21:22] but you also find out some people didn't
[1:21:24] hear it before even if they were there
[1:21:27] it didn't really just saturate you know
[1:21:30] or maybe they're like me and they have
[1:21:32] short-term memory loss and they they
[1:21:33] laugh at every joke like they're hearing
[1:21:35] it for the first time or Amen in every
[1:21:37] sermon like they're hearing it for the
[1:21:38] first time I don't know but I I just
[1:21:40] believe this is what God would have you
[1:21:42] to to to to uh Fellowship around this
[1:21:44] morning or to be to be uh to be blessed
[1:21:47] by amen and so I I do believe and I know
[1:21:50] this is maybe uh it's everyone doesn't
[1:21:53] believe it but I do brother bradam says
[1:21:55] that John was a type of the Overcomer in
[1:21:59] each age we know John did not die a
[1:22:02] death by martyrdom he lived into his
[1:22:05] Elder years and so he he talked about
[1:22:08] how he was banished to the aisle of
[1:22:10] patmas for the word of God and for the
[1:22:12] testimony of Jesus Christ and so here in
[1:22:16] Revelation Jesus begins to reveal
[1:22:18] himself to John as
[1:22:20] deity am mean as the oness of the
[1:22:23] godhead and then shows amen he's going
[1:22:25] to have seven churches on the earth or
[1:22:28] Seven Ages and each of those ages will
[1:22:30] have a messenger and and again we we
[1:22:33] referenced it a little earlyer this is
[1:22:34] the revelation of Christ's ongoing
[1:22:37] work his ongoing Revelation his ongoing
[1:22:42] unveiling in a mystical or a many
[1:22:45] membered body here in the earth and so
[1:22:47] John sees these things unfold in
[1:22:49] Revelations chapters 1 2 and 3 and then
[1:22:51] in Revelations chapter 4 four he said he
[1:22:53] looked and the door was opened in heaven
[1:22:55] and he heard a voice as it were of a
[1:22:57] trumpet that said come up hither so John
[1:23:00] is
[1:23:01] translated or John in a sense is
[1:23:04] raptured amen again typing the Overcomer
[1:23:08] all the Overcomers of every age will be
[1:23:11] raptured in fact they will be raised
[1:23:13] first and then the living Saints will be
[1:23:14] changed in a moment and twinkling of an
[1:23:16] eye to be raptured with them to meet the
[1:23:19] Lord in the air all right and so here we
[1:23:22] get over to Revelation chapter 5 and
[1:23:24] we're going to see something
[1:23:26] here we're going to see a prevailing
[1:23:29] Revelation amen and I saw in the right
[1:23:32] hand of him that was Christ the right
[1:23:35] hand of him that sat on the throne a
[1:23:37] book written within and on the backside
[1:23:39] sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a
[1:23:42] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[1:23:43] voice who is worthy to open the book and
[1:23:48] to loose the seals thereof and no man
[1:23:53] I emphasize no
[1:23:54] man no man Pardon Me In Heaven Nor in
[1:23:59] Earth neither under the Earth was able
[1:24:01] to open the book neither to look
[1:24:04] thereon i' remember it takes the same
[1:24:08] worthiness to look on it as it does to
[1:24:12] open
[1:24:15] it same worthiness to look on it as it
[1:24:19] does to open it amen but the one who
[1:24:22] opens it is going to reveal his
[1:24:26] worthiness in the ones who look on
[1:24:30] it and see the revelation of it you
[1:24:34] catch that it's
[1:24:37] beautiful but John is here and
[1:24:41] something's about to happen to John that
[1:24:43] also pertains to
[1:24:45] us I wept
[1:24:48] much because no man was found worthy to
[1:24:51] open and to red the book neither to look
[1:24:53] there on so John in the
[1:24:56] present um you know if if you yall know
[1:24:59] what a real the real is or how the old
[1:25:02] pictures I mean I I know what they
[1:25:05] talked today about a slide deck hey I
[1:25:07] remember when slides were in a deck you
[1:25:09] know and shuttered and Mission reports
[1:25:11] and all these things and they but so
[1:25:13] John is watching if if you will like a a
[1:25:17] a a
[1:25:19] screenplay or he's watching something
[1:25:21] trans Inspire in a
[1:25:23] vision and it it's changing as it goes
[1:25:29] it is unfolding or it is progressing and
[1:25:32] his job was to watch amen but he quit
[1:25:36] watching he became fixated on the fact
[1:25:41] that no man was worthy he wasn't worthy
[1:25:45] none of the Angels were worthy none of
[1:25:47] the 4 and20 Elders amen uh there was
[1:25:50] every man from Adam Enoch
[1:25:53] Abraham all the way through we and
[1:25:55] brandom included no man was worthy and
[1:25:57] so in in stuck in that realization he
[1:26:00] began to weep but an elder got his
[1:26:03] attention he said John quit worried
[1:26:05] about what's going on around
[1:26:07] you and watch the
[1:26:10] vision because the revelation will
[1:26:13] prevail amen friends I'm going to tell
[1:26:17] you quit tuning in to the websites come
[1:26:20] on come on turn off Facebook and social
[1:26:23] media and get back in the
[1:26:28] Revelation this is your message this is
[1:26:33] your Jubilee trumpet the message is
[1:26:36] yours all of the rest that's going
[1:26:38] around us it's total Blackness total
[1:26:41] darkness it's Leo deia I know all that
[1:26:44] but don't look at that get your eyes on
[1:26:48] Christ get your eyes on the revealed
[1:26:51] word of this hour amen because an elder
[1:26:55] had to grab John and said weep not John
[1:27:00] behold get your eyes off of your
[1:27:03] unworthiness your condition what's
[1:27:06] happening in your church in your family
[1:27:08] in the message in the government in the
[1:27:10] White House get your eyes on what has
[1:27:13] happening in the
[1:27:15] Supernatural we not John Behold The Lion
[1:27:19] of the tribe of Judah have
[1:27:23] prevailed the Revelation is prevailing
[1:27:27] the Revelation is unfolding the
[1:27:29] Revelation is
[1:27:32] Conquering every other opposing
[1:27:36] Force
[1:27:38] Hallelujah John said and I
[1:27:41] looked you know I'm just going to stop
[1:27:43] here for a minute as I know I shouldn't
[1:27:46] do but I'm going to do it
[1:27:47] anyway Mary came to the tomb one
[1:27:51] day and found it empty and called John
[1:27:54] and Peter and they too saw it was
[1:27:57] empty
[1:27:59] right none of them understood
[1:28:02] why none of them could make any sense of
[1:28:04] it but John and Peter walked
[1:28:08] away but the Bible says
[1:28:10] Mary went in
[1:28:14] again she just wasn't going to be
[1:28:18] settled she wasn't going to accept the
[1:28:21] fact
[1:28:23] that it was just an empty
[1:28:25] tomb and that was just the end of it she
[1:28:28] went back for another
[1:28:31] look and when she did she saw something
[1:28:35] that none of the three of them had seen
[1:28:38] even seconds
[1:28:41] before she saw an
[1:28:43] angel who said whom seekest thou
[1:28:46] Mary he's not here but he's risen she
[1:28:50] had enough persistence
[1:28:52] and enough determination not to follow
[1:28:56] even Peter and John who no doubt went
[1:28:57] away sucking discouraged amen despondent
[1:29:02] but she did not allow their amen lack of
[1:29:07] of Faith stop her she had a faith I left
[1:29:13] him here I came here to see him I came
[1:29:19] here to minister to him I came here to
[1:29:22] give my last act of worship to him now
[1:29:26] friend when you come to church with that
[1:29:28] determination you will see him you will
[1:29:31] meet him something will meet you there
[1:29:34] to say now I'm acting on your faith
[1:29:38] because you have that persistence Mary
[1:29:41] he's not here but he's
[1:29:44] risen friends it does take that that's
[1:29:49] right I don't know that God God honors
[1:29:51] scall wag Faith you know oh well I'm
[1:29:53] just here I'm just floating along who
[1:29:55] are you talking
[1:29:56] about if you don't have a head on
[1:29:58] collision with the devil every now and
[1:30:00] then you're probably going the same
[1:30:02] direction thank God you're facing some
[1:30:05] opposition thank God the devil is upset
[1:30:08] at what's going on in this hour amen
[1:30:10] don't bow down or bend into it amen
[1:30:12] stand up for what we know is the
[1:30:14] truth John said and I
[1:30:17] beheld lo in the midst of the throne and
[1:30:19] the four Elders the midst of the
[1:30:23] the Beast of the four edles stood a lamb
[1:30:26] and he came and took the
[1:30:28] book I'm going to skip
[1:30:31] down verse
[1:30:33] 13 and every creature which is in heaven
[1:30:36] and on Earth and under the Earth and
[1:30:38] such as are in the sea and all they in
[1:30:40] them heard I
[1:30:42] saying blessing and honor power and
[1:30:46] glory be unto him that sth upon the
[1:30:48] throne and unto the lamb forever more I
[1:30:52] know I got to stop I'm going to just
[1:30:53] have to now but
[1:30:56] friends John turned to see what was
[1:31:01] announced as a lamb excuse me a lion the
[1:31:06] lion he was announced as a lion but when
[1:31:09] John beheld him he was a
[1:31:15] lamb because he was John's atonement yes
[1:31:20] that's right he was John's
[1:31:23] propitiation he died in John's
[1:31:28] stead he died on John's
[1:31:31] behalf but he didn't stay
[1:31:35] dead he rose for John's
[1:31:40] justification and John realized for the
[1:31:43] first time in his life when that lamb
[1:31:49] prevailed I prevailed amen
[1:31:52] when that lamb was found worthy I Was
[1:31:55] Made
[1:31:57] worthy that lamb is
[1:32:00] God that lamb is King that lamb is
[1:32:04] priest and John saw himself in that lamb
[1:32:09] and realized for the first time in his
[1:32:12] life what the things he had
[1:32:17] experienced days weeks months and years
[1:32:20] before actually meant to him as a person
[1:32:23] brother B said he saw his name yes
[1:32:26] that's right that's it he saw his name
[1:32:28] it became personal he saw his name in
[1:32:31] the Lamb's Book of Life now this is what
[1:32:33] is so and the musicians can return this
[1:32:35] is what is so astounding to me about
[1:32:37] this because John was a beloved disciple
[1:32:41] I mean he was kind of in a different
[1:32:43] category than Peter
[1:32:46] Luke uh you know the Matthew and the
[1:32:50] others John was the beloved
[1:32:52] disciple probably closer to the to the
[1:32:55] Lord than any of the others leaned on
[1:32:58] his bosom amen stood there with Mary at
[1:33:02] the foot of the cross when others the
[1:33:04] rest the other 10 had abandoned Christ
[1:33:07] and Judas
[1:33:08] too and Jesus
[1:33:11] said behold thy mother woman Behold thy
[1:33:14] son speaking to John and Mary John was
[1:33:19] present at the resurrection
[1:33:22] knew he was a risen savior knew he was a
[1:33:24] risen Christ he was present on the day
[1:33:26] of
[1:33:27] Pentecost when the spirit of God fell
[1:33:30] and quickened him into the body of
[1:33:33] Christ as a Believer but until John saw
[1:33:37] his name in the Lamb's Book of Life he
[1:33:42] didn't worship him like he did
[1:33:47] afterwards and friends
[1:33:50] this
[1:33:52] this is what has a great meaning to me a
[1:33:56] as someone who has served God for the
[1:33:58] better part of my life I'm 45 years old
[1:34:00] I was raised in the message gave my
[1:34:03] heart to God at an early age and know
[1:34:07] that I'm a Spirit-filled Born Again
[1:34:08] believer amen but even in that there are
[1:34:13] things that as we go through our
[1:34:15] Christian Journey will emerge from the
[1:34:18] word of God to make known to us in a
[1:34:23] greater
[1:34:24] way what those things really mean to
[1:34:29] us it's a prevailing
[1:34:33] Revelation it's still carving away more
[1:34:36] of the unbelief or more of our darkened
[1:34:41] realization bringing us into a greater
[1:34:44] and more perfect light of the revealed
[1:34:47] word of the hour till one day it will
[1:34:49] literally change our body
[1:34:53] bodies I believe that with all of my
[1:34:56] heart and I know it's going to
[1:34:58] Prevail I rest in that this
[1:35:02] morning so friends keep
[1:35:05] praying keep believing keep persevering
[1:35:09] stay in the word of God and God has
[1:35:12] placed you under a wonderful ministry
[1:35:14] here to feed you stay in that amen it's
[1:35:18] going to Prevail amen keep fighting the
[1:35:21] good fight of Faith amen we'll we'll go

[1:38:11] has given us this message has opened up
[1:38:15] the Bible where we can see our place in
[1:38:17] it given us that prevailing Revelation
[1:38:20] that our brother has been talking about
[1:38:22] let's just uh we're right here at the
[1:38:25] top of the hour so we're going to go and
