[20:12] father we thank you

[20:34] destructions we love you we thank you we
[20:37] commit everything to you now and guide
[20:40] each and every one of us in Jesus name
[20:43] amen
[20:45] until we got Revelations we're going to
[20:48] try to pick up a little bit
[20:50] in our thought of what we hated to 25
[20:53] Services ago all right so we'll go to
[20:57] Revelations 1 12. and I turn to see the
[21:00] voice that Spate when the end being
[21:01] turned I saw seven golden candlesticks
[21:04] in the midst of the seven candlesticks
[21:06] one like unto the son of man clothed
[21:08] with a garment down to the foot and gird
[21:10] about the pouch with a golden girdle
[21:12] all right we're continuing our reading
[21:14] today to try to pick up a little more
[21:16] his head and his hairs were white like
[21:19] wool as white as snow and his eyes were
[21:22] as a flame of fire and his feet likened
[21:26] to find Bryce as they burned in a
[21:29] furnace and his voice is the sound of
[21:31] many Waters
[21:33] and he had in his right hand Seven Stars
[21:35] and out of his mouth went a shark
[21:37] two-edged sword and his countenance was
[21:40] as the sun shineth in his strength now
[21:44] this is a picture of Christ throughout
[21:46] the word right
[21:48] that's where we're getting to now what
[21:51] we're talking on when I saw him I fell
[21:53] at his feet as dead and he laid his
[21:55] right hand upon me saying unto me fear
[21:58] not I am the first and the lice I am he
[22:00] that liveth and was dead and behold I Am
[22:03] Alive forevermore amen and have the keys
[22:05] of hell and death and of death so if
[22:10] you'd like to go with us and we'll go
[22:12] over to Corinthians
[22:15] First Corinthians 2
[22:18] we'll begin verse 1.
[22:22] and I Brethren when I came to you came
[22:24] not with Excellency of speech or of
[22:26] wisdom declaring unto you the testimony
[22:28] of God but I determined not to know
[22:31] anything among you save Jesus Christ and
[22:34] him crucified
[22:35] I was with you in weakness and in fear
[22:37] and much trembling and my speech in my
[22:40] preaching was not with enticing words of
[22:42] man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the
[22:44] spirit and of power that your faith
[22:47] should not stand in the wisdom of men
[22:49] men but in the power of God
[22:52] albeit we speak wisdom among them that
[22:55] are perfect yet not the wisdom of this
[22:58] world nor the princes of this world that
[23:00] come to know but we speak the wisdom of
[23:03] God listen in a mystery now watch him
[23:06] after a while when we read around I'm
[23:07] talking about a mystery but we speak the
[23:10] wisdom of God in a mystery even the
[23:13] hidden wisdom which God ordained before
[23:15] the world into our Glory which none of
[23:18] the princes of this world knew for
[23:20] had they known it they would not have
[23:23] crucified the Lord Of Glory that will be
[23:28] our thought today all right we pick up
[23:30] in in First Corinthians 15 45.
[23:36] and so it is written the first man Adam
[23:38] was made a living Soul the last Adam was
[23:40] made a quickening spirit how be it or
[23:42] nevertheless he would say that was not
[23:45] first which is spiritual but that which
[23:47] is natural and afterward that which is
[23:49] spiritual all right coming on down the
[23:52] first man is of the earth earthy
[23:54] the second man is the Lord From Heaven
[23:58] as is the earthy such are they also that
[24:01] are earthy and as is the Heavenly such
[24:04] are they also that are heavenly
[24:08] now watch and as we have borne the image
[24:11] of the earth we
[24:12] we shall also bear the image of the
[24:16] Heavenly you may be seated the Lord that
[24:18] is blessing to the reading of his word
[24:22] all right
[24:28] now we
[24:29] have spent quite a time and I hope that
[24:32] it too
[24:34] helps with our Wednesday we kind of
[24:36] change the things around and picked up
[24:39] some thoughts that I wanted to make sure
[24:41] you would understand me
[24:44] and you know what I'm saying to you and
[24:46] what I try to get across
[24:48] because we've been talking about and I
[24:51] said we won't get there as much in
[24:53] Revelations but it comes down describing
[24:57] uh the Lord Jesus Christ you know her
[24:59] like
[25:00] wool etc etc all right we will
[25:03] eventually get back in the Lord willing
[25:05] in the scriptures to pick that up but
[25:08] I'm wanting you to look at those things
[25:10] through the unveiling of God as he's
[25:13] being revealed through his word
[25:15] all right coming down through the word
[25:18] coming out to the time that we're living
[25:21] as a prophet would say it it's in Christ
[25:23] the mystery he said unveiling or
[25:24] unfolding itself down to this present
[25:27] hour
[25:28] now
[25:30] you know
[25:32] if it's not revealed to you and I
[25:35] mean that's the way I think I'm just I
[25:37] try to be this way
[25:40] if it's not revealed to you and I
[25:42] what's going on today
[25:45] Among Us you know I'm talking about all
[25:48] around the world now the bride of Christ
[25:51] then see we are not living in the
[25:53] present day tense
[25:55] we are still in the past or in some way
[25:58] trying to go into the future
[26:01] you know with it just you know because
[26:04] that's remember that's the problem is
[26:06] we're either back there trying thinking
[26:08] about what was or we're trying to figure
[26:11] out what will be and instead of missing
[26:14] or seeing what is now among us all right
[26:18] and see you can only see it unfold down
[26:20] to where you are
[26:23] you understand I mean that's as far as
[26:25] you can see you you can't see anymore
[26:27] the the rest of that future that has not
[26:30] come to pass yet that you may be able to
[26:32] see by visions you may be able to see by
[26:36] the word of the Lord come into the
[26:38] prophet he's already preached us like I
[26:40] told a man one time he was trying to
[26:41] tell me all about going up Beyond
[26:43] brother Branham I said well
[26:45] okay now I'm sorry but uh I want you to
[26:50] tell me what's going to take place after
[26:51] the future home
[26:53] and he looked at me
[26:55] well the prophet preached us to the
[26:57] Future home didn't he
[26:59] and told us about what would happen in
[27:01] the future home so if you're going to
[27:02] tell us something extra
[27:04] going over past dire and give us
[27:06] something
[27:07] and of course that wasn't exactly what
[27:09] he was talking about but you know that
[27:11] was just my way of getting a point
[27:13] across all right but you see
[27:16] unfolding down to the present hour
[27:20] now brother Branham saw the future he
[27:23] saw things
[27:24] but he didn't see that what's in the
[27:27] paper today that or the news today
[27:30] according to what was on their
[27:32] telephones that our president is going
[27:36] to declare that we can only go to church
[27:37] what
[27:39] twice a month
[27:43] well that's pretty good
[27:46] that's supposed to be on the news today
[27:47] now if anybody on the internet gets that
[27:49] and it ain't on there it ain't my fault
[27:52] I read it on the telephone or what they
[27:54] were saying okay
[27:55] all right but you know there is a law in
[27:59] the state of Georgia you can only travel
[28:01] 25 miles to church
[28:03] that would pretty well eradicate this
[28:05] church but that's been there for a long
[28:08] time back about 1974.
[28:11] all right but we're not caring about
[28:14] that we can handle things we will handle
[28:17] things and the way we're getting it now
[28:20] if it forces us we can just uh you can
[28:23] have your two weeks at home and I'll
[28:25] have my two weeks in the church
[28:29] oh okay we can go to internet and just
[28:32] get the whole month down that's all
[28:34] right I ain't worried about that see
[28:36] those things concern me nothing right
[28:40] because what is it what good is it is
[28:42] that going to put me in a Rapture cause
[28:43] I can't go to church oh it's here now
[28:45] the president is going to that's gonna
[28:47] be a war president this time well okay
[28:52] God puts in Kings and takes them out he
[28:56] puts in presidents and he takes them out
[28:58] so it's all right whatever what we need
[29:00] okay
[29:02] all right we're getting back to our
[29:03] point
[29:05] now we've covered it two or three
[29:07] messages to make sure and try to get it
[29:09] to you but see
[29:11] we can look at the Bible and we're
[29:13] supposed to see the condescending of God
[29:16] Our God coming down to reveal himself to
[29:20] mankind all right now in that doing we
[29:23] covered it to the bases of trying to get
[29:25] the point for you see that it's easy a
[29:28] lot of times to see the anointing
[29:31] and follow that
[29:33] throughout the Bible and as the prophet
[29:36] said unless you see Christ in every
[29:37] verse go back and read it again you
[29:39] missed something well that's that's good
[29:41] you know that's right and we believe it
[29:43] and we followed that through the Bible
[29:45] as showing the anointing that could come
[29:47] upon people and great things would take
[29:51] place but remember that anointing was
[29:54] not what saved those people from any of
[29:57] the judgments of those times you'd say
[30:00] well anointing was described all right
[30:03] but we we've supposed to be down to
[30:05] understanding now
[30:07] that the anointing can be upon you of
[30:10] the genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit
[30:13] upon your spirit and you still be lost
[30:17] now that's one of the Mysteries of the
[30:19] end time
[30:20] of the anointed ones and it's not false
[30:23] anointed one do we we put that on there
[30:25] it's anointed ones that are false
[30:28] me the anointing is genuine
[30:31] all right it's the doing you say well
[30:34] why would God allow that to happen to
[30:36] try you and I to see whether we're going
[30:38] to be little babies you know are we
[30:41] going to be men and women of the Gospel
[30:43] to stand upon God's word and believe it
[30:46] are we going to be scared of who's going
[30:47] to be president
[30:49] me
[30:51] I I'm going to go ahead and make my
[30:53] statement I don't feel like you're
[30:54] Hillary I don't figure Hillary would
[30:56] even have said it like that like him
[30:58] saying if that's true that you're going
[31:00] to have it in two Services a month I
[31:02] don't believe she'd go that far all
[31:04] right yeah I don't know okay
[31:07] but listen
[31:10] following the Christ throughout the
[31:12] Bible
[31:14] we can see the great things taking place
[31:16] upon the people of the Bible and great
[31:20] things happening but can you follow the
[31:23] very person of God throughout the word
[31:27] to see him revealed in the word not just
[31:30] the anointing because the anointing
[31:33] never saved anybody
[31:35] now come on don't get me all grooved up
[31:38] in your mind and all I know about the
[31:40] Holy Ghost coming down and doing the
[31:42] things right but remember the anointing
[31:45] won't save you
[31:46] it takes the person of Jesus Christ to
[31:49] give you eternal life
[31:51] it's not just an anointing that won't
[31:53] work all right then see we look at that
[31:56] all right and see how that the coming of
[32:00] the Lord is the revealing of his word
[32:03] all right that's as good a definition of
[32:06] any to put to it because that'll fit the
[32:08] entire Bible and anything you could
[32:10] think of that would go with it that your
[32:13] own personal points but it's still got
[32:15] to come back to the revealing of the
[32:16] word of God all right now in that then
[32:20] as we can speak here of it
[32:23] and look at the word can we see
[32:27] God in his word
[32:29] or just read about the Christ now as I
[32:32] told you
[32:34] um anybody can read the Bible and if
[32:37] they pick up one thought of that's the
[32:38] Christ
[32:40] they can make a great discourse of our
[32:43] speech or you know a message about the
[32:46] Christ throughout the Bible
[32:48] but how many people have you ever heard
[32:50] talk about the person of God
[32:56] being revealed throughout the word
[33:00] the Fourth Man In The Fire wasn't an
[33:03] anointing
[33:05] me
[33:07] that was a person
[33:08] amen all right and see him come down
[33:11] through there as the one that would be
[33:13] in all of those Prophets
[33:15] and live their lives out to show things
[33:18] and like I was saying to you the
[33:20] anointing on on Elisha or Elijah there
[33:24] you know with the she bar that anointing
[33:26] could be that right around and said that
[33:28] wasn't
[33:29] of God that was the power of the Prophet
[33:32] going with the anointing all right
[33:35] but see
[33:37] if it would have been the real God of
[33:39] the word they would have been sparing
[33:41] the children
[33:43] and I'm rough I know
[33:45] but it would have been destroying the
[33:47] parents
[33:48] is the ones that already been ate up by
[33:50] the virus
[33:51] all right because they were the one that
[33:54] caused the children to say what to say
[33:55] it
[33:57] all right
[33:58] and see they were the one that deserved
[34:00] it but now we you know okay
[34:02] all right
[34:04] but now
[34:06] we read here in in Corinthians
[34:09] that it said had they known who this was
[34:14] they would have not killed
[34:18] the Lord of Glory
[34:22] had they known who that was would they
[34:24] have killed him
[34:27] and they killed him for saying exactly
[34:29] what the word saying
[34:32] and they were the ones that were
[34:34] supposed to know the word to the letter
[34:36] of what it said
[34:40] like I was saying the other day about it
[34:41] see when when Paul took that Old
[34:44] Testament Scrolls to the backside of the
[34:46] desert he already knew about the Messiah
[34:49] that was promised he already knew that a
[34:52] child would be born he already knew
[34:54] those great things
[34:56] but he could not see that this was Jesus
[35:00] Christ that was speaking to him was that
[35:03] God of the Old Testament living right
[35:05] there in front of him
[35:07] and I asked you and I the questions do
[35:10] we see that
[35:13] we can talk about seeing as I say and
[35:15] keep saying that we can see the Christ
[35:17] in the word and we can talk about that
[35:19] and we can see the anointings and the
[35:21] great things that happened but could we
[35:23] see what I was trying to bring out that
[35:25] Jesus was the very manifestation of the
[35:28] love of God
[35:30] because he was God
[35:32] all right
[35:34] see he was back there revealing himself
[35:37] through those prophets as they were
[35:40] building the body
[35:43] me
[35:44] that John would finally come to
[35:46] introduce the god of the word right
[35:50] who was it being made known back there
[35:55] read Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[35:58] God had a plan and a purpose
[36:01] the anointing don't let him to be known
[36:04] as healer and savior
[36:09] see you I know in your mind if you had
[36:12] never heard that that clicks in the
[36:14] wrong way but you you see it's not the
[36:16] anointing that saves you it's not the
[36:18] anointing that healed you
[36:21] if it is why did he get beat
[36:24] why does it say you know by Stripes
[36:26] we're healed
[36:28] why did he have to die on the cross
[36:32] if it was just an anointing
[36:37] we see there was a whole lot more taking
[36:38] place back there
[36:40] and we are supposed to be watching that
[36:43] person
[36:44] of the word as he reveals himself down
[36:48] through the Bible
[36:49] and coming down to the ages coming down
[36:52] to this end time Prophet that would
[36:55] bring us the entire word of God
[36:58] but then there's got to be a group of
[37:00] people it's got to be that word
[37:02] that's right all right that's our choice
[37:05] okay
[37:06] see he was The Lord Of Glory
[37:12] he wasn't just a man
[37:15] he was the very God of Eternity
[37:17] revealed in flesh
[37:20] all right
[37:21] but can you follow that the prophet even
[37:23] used it calls him the Lord Of Glory on
[37:25] the revelation of Jesus Christ all right
[37:29] we'll buy some of these because we've
[37:30] got so many number two they'll pick it
[37:33] up on spiritual adoption and let's see
[37:35] who this was that we're talking about
[37:39] because he was The Lord Of Glory made
[37:41] manifest so he's the Lord Jesus Christ
[37:44] the god of Glory made manifest that's
[37:46] what he's saying on the revelation of
[37:48] Jesus Christ look what he says here on
[37:49] the spiritual adoption
[37:51] and the father today
[37:54] has put the right kind of a tutor over
[37:56] his sons you and I
[37:59] I selected none other than the very
[38:02] heart and soul of the Lord Jesus to
[38:06] raise us in the admonition of God
[38:11] the very heart and soul of almighty God
[38:15] In You and I by a new birth
[38:21] not just an anointing
[38:28] I know that I require that you think
[38:31] about what you're saying but why don't
[38:33] you want to think about it I mean your
[38:35] life is at stake hey folks we getting
[38:36] older whether you realize it or not go
[38:39] home and look in the mirror
[38:43] if something don't happen pretty quick
[38:44] we're going to all be down at the
[38:46] funeral home
[38:47] or the nursing home first
[38:51] see we've had 40 something years we've
[38:53] been going around horrible
[38:57] right
[38:59] you see waiting
[39:01] for it to be made known
[39:04] but the very heart and soul
[39:08] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[39:12] comes and lives in you and I
[39:15] in the new birth
[39:17] well I don't I I don't understand how it
[39:20] can be heart and soul
[39:24] oh heart here Souls here
[39:27] see you're still back in the thoughts of
[39:28] what your mind is trying to tell you
[39:31] instead of looking at it correctly
[39:33] the heart of anything is the center of
[39:35] anything that's the middle of it it's
[39:37] not a your thumping gizzard is not your
[39:39] soul see
[39:41] all right
[39:43] but now
[39:47] thinking about it
[39:51] we've covered in quite Lance
[39:54] now
[39:56] that
[39:58] the Genesis 1 26 man
[40:01] was made in the image of God
[40:04] all right
[40:07] now
[40:09] and then we've just touched a little
[40:11] because we knew we would come into this
[40:13] eventually
[40:16] that
[40:17] see as we were made in the image of God
[40:22] then God comes into the image of man
[40:27] all right
[40:28] now may I make a statement let you think
[40:31] on it
[40:33] we talk about image
[40:36] as being that that's not another person
[40:39] we talk about that Genesis 1 26 man is
[40:43] is the manifestation of God
[40:47] you know
[40:49] because it is the eternal life
[40:51] all right that was what put in Adam and
[40:53] Eve
[40:55] but we had to bypass all of that and
[40:57] come down to flesh to be tempted
[41:00] all right
[41:01] but there was one who came
[41:04] into the world
[41:06] that was the very heart the soul the
[41:09] mind the spirit the all in all almighty
[41:12] God himself
[41:17] that's why I spent so much time trying
[41:19] to get our thoughts away from God it's
[41:21] just a spirit
[41:27] all right you may have got tired of
[41:29] hearing that
[41:30] but one of these days you know what
[41:31] it'll down on you
[41:33] and God can reveal it to you that that
[41:36] he's not just a spirit that he's real
[41:39] all right Paul said if needful if I say
[41:42] it two or three times
[41:44] all right I may say it 25. so forgive me
[41:47] but just think about it
[41:50] what do you think about almighty God
[41:54] how real is your god
[41:58] then you see why who would be concerned
[42:00] about a president making a documentary
[42:03] statement
[42:05] or who doing what
[42:08] why would you be concerned about it
[42:11] if you're thinking about the God of
[42:13] Glory
[42:14] you mean the one down through all of the
[42:16] Bible that protected those people and
[42:19] done all the great things under the
[42:21] anointing we talk about and you think
[42:23] it's going to come in the end time and
[42:25] going to finish up in the bases that
[42:28] would well we just sat around waiting on
[42:30] a bus to pull up
[42:33] don't take off
[42:36] you mean that's what you think will it
[42:38] be the finish of the entire Bible
[42:42] when even the great things that that
[42:45] goes to the Jews and the things
[42:46] hereafter
[42:50] the prophet said
[42:53] and taught us
[42:55] we were the center of the Bible
[42:59] not to just say the Jews
[43:02] but the bride of Christ
[43:05] he said when she realizes who she is and
[43:08] what she's here for
[43:10] Satan will be powerless
[43:12] all right
[43:15] you say are you looking forward to that
[43:16] no no I'm looking at it excuse me I
[43:20] don't like to look forward I look I like
[43:22] to look at things
[43:24] all right and see it here yeah but I
[43:27] don't see no open your eyes
[43:29] we were talking yesterday about things
[43:32] that God has done Among Us and you'd say
[43:35] well no that was doctors they operate on
[43:37] they done this that and the other woohoo
[43:39] give them the ability to do that
[43:42] where did the medicine you take come
[43:43] from now sure we know there's bad stuff
[43:47] right
[43:49] but there's also a lot of good stuff
[43:51] right
[43:53] right go home through all your pills out
[43:57] you become like we used to be you know
[43:59] and I didn't have it but I don't know
[44:00] many of you did you take your cigarettes
[44:02] and boy you throw them out the window of
[44:04] the car the next day you're riding down
[44:06] the road looking to see find them laying
[44:08] out there
[44:09] well go sling your pills out
[44:12] a couple of days later you're gonna be
[44:13] hunting a doctor up to write you another
[44:15] one
[44:16] you know so why not just be realistic
[44:18] and just take it like it is and not
[44:20] worry about it and say God is here with
[44:21] us because without it where would we be
[44:25] all right yeah but I want to see this I
[44:27] want you'll never see it that way
[44:31] it was never in the Bible that people
[44:33] wanted to see something that took place
[44:37] it always took place and then they found
[44:38] out later it done took place right
[44:42] you think the children of Israel even
[44:44] out of Egypt
[44:45] thought Moses was to deliver when he run
[44:47] up against a wall of water
[44:49] and couldn't get across
[44:53] he didn't think too much about that
[44:55] being Victorious they just wanted to go
[44:56] back
[44:58] become slaves
[45:00] all right okay get off of it
[45:03] but listen
[45:08] now
[45:10] bear with the thought
[45:13] and get it correctly of what I'm saying
[45:17] okay
[45:20] we were made in the image of God
[45:23] in a spiritual being
[45:26] the flesh man was made in the image of
[45:29] the animal or the form or the ways of
[45:31] the animal and time
[45:33] but then God came down
[45:36] and was made in our image
[45:40] right as a man
[45:43] amen all right
[45:44] now
[45:46] do we hold it being in the image of God
[45:49] I hope after all that I've said coming
[45:52] down to a point that this Genesis 1 26
[45:55] and 27 man was eternal life
[45:59] and that if we have that eternal life
[46:03] then it has been made manifest in our
[46:05] hearts and our soul the very being of
[46:08] God Living In You and I
[46:12] are you still just some anointing
[46:17] uh I like what Brother Gary Atkins said
[46:20] one day he said brother Dale if I'm an
[46:23] anointed one I'm
[46:24] I'm not too much anointed you know
[46:27] that's that was his point I hope he's
[46:30] watching in he'll laugh at that all
[46:32] right
[46:34] but you see we think
[46:40] that we're only speaking of the image of
[46:42] God as being that spiritual man
[46:47] but
[46:50] if man is made of the highest form of
[46:53] animals which you then he would be
[46:55] higher than anything
[46:58] would it not be
[47:02] that
[47:03] God would look like us
[47:07] right
[47:09] so no that's that's hard for you to
[47:12] swallow isn't it
[47:14] well what do you look like
[47:17] well it was just a spirit
[47:20] now according to the prophet that's not
[47:22] true
[47:24] but you know what prophet could say that
[47:26] 25 times it still ain't gonna get
[47:28] through that brain of yours until the
[47:30] Holy Ghost reveals it I know that
[47:34] all right
[47:36] well see wouldn't it be then that God
[47:38] was a fully intending
[47:42] to create man
[47:47] and that the man that he would create
[47:49] that he could fellowship with that man
[47:55] was he in the garden just a theophany
[47:58] body and walking around
[48:03] or was that almighty God walking around
[48:06] because either way you put it it's going
[48:08] to turn out to be the same thing so you
[48:09] might as well admit it all right
[48:12] because he was not a glob talking to
[48:15] Adam and Eve they brought around and
[48:17] said he'd come down in the cool of the
[48:19] day and put him to sleep and lay him
[48:21] down
[48:22] and saying children have you had a good
[48:24] time today well it was just anointing
[48:27] floating in the garden and they just
[48:28] knew it was oh yeah yeah see
[48:32] you're not getting the reality of a
[48:34] living God
[48:37] that we would be greater than he is come
[48:40] on
[48:41] all right
[48:44] but you see then
[48:45] would it not be his plan and purpose
[48:48] even if there was not a fall
[48:51] he had already started with two people
[48:57] well then what image would God be
[49:06] that's
[49:07] yes but it's only in the spiritual image
[49:10] that we are
[49:12] well
[49:14] I
[49:15] I don't think my guard looked like a
[49:17] monkey
[49:19] I don't think he'll look like a monkey
[49:21] when we get there
[49:22] because according to the Bible
[49:29] I get dirty I know it but according to
[49:31] the Bible the Bible said we'll have a
[49:33] body what
[49:35] like unto his glorious body
[49:40] well we're gonna go back looking like
[49:42] monkeys
[49:43] crawling around with our Knuckles on the
[49:45] ground
[49:46] you say you silly no ain't silly telling
[49:48] the truth
[49:51] what do you think
[49:54] me
[49:56] he brought man into the where he was and
[49:58] I know that he was brought into the
[50:00] image of man yeah the form of man
[50:07] change in other words brought from the
[50:09] supernatural down through is we would
[50:12] talk about the theophany the the
[50:15] spiritual man and then on down into
[50:17] being human flesh
[50:21] and sure we'll get to it a little while
[50:24] that flesh and Melchizedek was not able
[50:27] to die for you
[50:29] there was a reason for that because he
[50:31] had to be a kinsman redeemer in that
[50:33] flesh of Mount chattered it was just a
[50:35] flesh-spoken in spoken out it wouldn't
[50:37] you can't have him to die for you
[50:40] but you better think too that as a baby
[50:42] he couldn't die for you
[50:43] you better think as a teenager that he
[50:46] was confounding the why Scholars but yet
[50:49] he couldn't die
[50:50] at that position you better think about
[50:52] it 33 years at 30 years of age when he
[50:55] become Anointed with that Holy Spirit on
[50:57] the River Jordan that at that time he
[50:59] couldn't die for you and I
[51:02] because the word had not been fulfilled
[51:05] okay
[51:08] there's a lot of scriptures there that
[51:09] we need to think about instead of taking
[51:11] our own ideas
[51:16] but it's so hard for the human mind
[51:19] to I guess I know this is what I've been
[51:23] accused of
[51:25] they say brother Dale you're making him
[51:26] too human
[51:31] I'm not making him human
[51:33] the Bible and the prophets wasn't doing
[51:36] it I'm just reading what he says
[51:39] you accuse me
[51:41] now
[51:44] would you say but but but but but but
[51:45] brother they'll leave him God
[51:49] I have no problem with it
[51:52] right because when this thing is over
[51:53] and finished
[51:56] I've told you what I believe
[51:58] I believe when we get dire we'll see
[52:01] Jesus we won't see a little halo over
[52:03] here for the father and a little spot
[52:05] over here for the Holy Ghost
[52:07] because that wasn't what Jesus said
[52:10] he said if you've seen me you've seen
[52:13] the pillar of fire you've seen the
[52:14] anointing you've seen the father
[52:18] in that Bible
[52:20] all right
[52:24] but see it requires you to think out of
[52:26] what his old saying of course what is
[52:28] that thing the big old words are you you
[52:29] got to think out of the box I never did
[52:31] figure that out because I never got in
[52:32] the Box I didn't know what it was
[52:34] but it means to get away simply from
[52:37] what you used to or what you've been
[52:39] taught
[52:40] you know
[52:44] but listen
[52:46] if God is real why would we not think of
[52:50] him
[52:52] as being
[52:54] in our form
[52:56] look it like this
[52:59] well that would only end Jesus okay we
[53:03] solve that with a scripture we get there
[53:05] we have a body like in his glorious body
[53:07] so that's supposed to be Jesus right
[53:14] but you see it's hard for us to think
[53:16] about
[53:18] that that man that walked the shores of
[53:20] Galilee was none other than the very
[53:22] heart and soul of the Lord Jesus
[53:28] to raise us in the admiration of God
[53:34] that's supposed to be your new birth
[53:36] your tutor he just got through
[53:37] explaining the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[53:43] is the person of Jesus Christ
[53:45] all right what are we then
[53:53] what are we
[53:56] and then
[53:58] what is he
[54:01] we'll get to it maybe this afternoon or
[54:03] it won't be then
[54:05] um
[54:07] maybe next Sunday
[54:09] what is man the dark mindful of him and
[54:11] the son of man that's how visit is him
[54:13] all right
[54:15] now
[54:17] let's go on down to number three
[54:19] brothers and just read these and I'll go
[54:21] as far as I can go if I don't worry
[54:23] about it I'll stop and start over
[54:26] but he's talking about the baptism if
[54:28] you remember this is where it's at uh
[54:30] that don't mean that you're saved not by
[54:33] our long ways
[54:36] look at here
[54:37] you're a Trion being
[54:40] you are inside this little fella here is
[54:42] the soul the next is the spirit the next
[54:45] is the body
[54:46] now you got five senses in this body to
[54:49] contact your Earthly home they don't
[54:51] contact the rest of it you got five
[54:53] senses of the spirit here love conscious
[54:55] and so forth of that but in here is
[54:58] where you live that's what you are
[55:01] all right
[55:03] a try on being
[55:08] a you're a Trion being
[55:12] Body Spirit and soul
[55:14] all right now we say this here because
[55:16] to keep people from uh running off on
[55:19] what they're doing remember in the early
[55:21] Ministry
[55:23] brother Branham was explaining and he
[55:26] basically covered body
[55:29] Soul and Spirit
[55:33] and then on the life's part that he
[55:35] comes into the 63 4-5 especially the
[55:37] opening of the seals he was explaining
[55:40] the body the spirit and the soul but
[55:43] never did he change the senses of that
[55:45] position he always gave the first
[55:48] position five senses he takes feel smell
[55:51] in here he always gave the second Rim
[55:53] whether he called it Soul or called it
[55:54] Spirit he made that as to be Memory
[55:57] conscious affections Etc and the center
[56:00] part was one sense either Faith or doubt
[56:02] all right that ties together the entire
[56:04] message to her that someone will not he
[56:07] don't know what he's talking about he
[56:09] said Body Spirit and so brother Brown
[56:10] says Body Soul and Spirit
[56:12] oh just wonderful
[56:16] but that don't impress me
[56:20] it don't impress me how beautiful words
[56:22] you can use
[56:24] what impresses me is what you can bring
[56:26] that I can
[56:29] let God reveal that to me
[56:33] all right
[56:35] well see you're a Trion being
[56:39] Body Spirit and soul
[56:42] all right
[56:44] and be in that Triune being
[56:48] look what he says about it
[56:50] go ahead number four
[56:52] questions and answers
[56:54] 1960
[56:56] one
[56:59] please explain the difference between
[57:00] spirit and soul
[57:02] well that's a hard one but the first
[57:05] thing you're a Trion being
[57:07] just like Father Son and Holy Ghost
[57:08] Father Son and Holy Ghost is three
[57:10] titles going to one person which is
[57:13] Jesus Christ and your soul body and
[57:16] spirit but it takes those three to make
[57:18] you with just one of them you're not you
[57:21] it takes the tree to make you now we're
[57:24] going to read one in a minute where he
[57:25] says it takes a three to make God
[57:29] because see that's where we're not
[57:30] Oneness
[57:32] as Jesus only
[57:36] all right that Jesus was the last
[57:39] manifestation of God
[57:41] you know and one like your finger and
[57:42] we're not Trinity of three persons
[57:46] but we've got to keep it to the point
[57:48] that he is a Triune being right
[57:52] or you can't tie together the Bible
[57:56] me
[57:57] you'll be getting things all messed up
[58:00] all right but look
[58:03] it takes no Street to make you
[58:07] with just one of them you're not you
[58:12] it takes three to make you
[58:14] Body Spirit Soul everyone you're going
[58:17] to say it and put it on it takes that to
[58:20] make you
[58:21] all right
[58:23] now
[58:24] that'd be a good high school lesson on
[58:26] what is the word for it biology
[58:29] but
[58:31] it takes a revelation
[58:35] now look what he brings out
[58:37] we're going down into God's go to number
[58:40] five
[58:41] God's covenant with Abraham
[58:43] roller donut
[58:45] you read all of it before and after and
[58:47] don't worry about it
[58:48] he talks about the senses to contact the
[58:51] home so he says fail those are to
[58:54] contact the early home but none of those
[58:57] are to contact God
[58:59] he's a a man is a man is a makeup of a
[59:04] Triune being soul body and spirit a
[59:08] trinity in a man
[59:11] just like God was a trinity in a man
[59:17] right now he's not explaining Trinity
[59:20] right
[59:25] right
[59:27] he's explaining what he is Father Son
[59:30] and Holy Ghost Body Spirit soul
[59:34] takes that to make you it takes Father
[59:36] Son and Holy Ghost to make one true and
[59:38] living God
[59:40] but that's not a trinity
[59:44] right
[59:47] so keep that in line now
[59:50] go to the next one
[59:53] number six questions and answers in 54.
[59:57] see the Bible said he wept the lady you
[59:59] know was proving that he was just a man
[1:00:02] and that proves
[1:00:04] proves he could weep I said sure
[1:00:06] that was the son that was weeping
[1:00:10] he was a God man
[1:00:13] he was a Triune being just like I am you
[1:00:16] are we're soul body and spirit he was
[1:00:20] Father Son and Holy Ghost and the deity
[1:00:23] of God that's who he was he was the
[1:00:26] deity of God all right now
[1:00:29] just like I am
[1:00:31] he was a Trion being just like I'm a
[1:00:33] drone being
[1:00:38] is that enough
[1:00:40] for you to believe that he was dwelling
[1:00:43] on Earth as
[1:00:45] the Bible says God was in Christ
[1:00:47] reconciling the world unto himself
[1:00:52] is that enough for you to follow we have
[1:00:54] plenty more don't worry about it but is
[1:00:57] that enough for you to follow that
[1:01:00] the Bible according to the scriptures
[1:01:02] Hebrews 10 5 a body thou has prepared me
[1:01:05] that body was provided by the form of
[1:01:09] Mary receiving the seeds you know the
[1:01:11] egg and the sperm to produce the baby
[1:01:13] and had nothing to do with it herself
[1:01:18] other than an incubator but it brought a
[1:01:20] body
[1:01:22] all right
[1:01:24] now according to these latest doctrines
[1:01:27] it's out now that Jesus wouldn't God to
[1:01:29] the River Jordan then they're saying
[1:01:31] that when he was born to have to be
[1:01:33] saying it then when he was born he just
[1:01:34] got a a spirit and a soul of a man
[1:01:39] Hey Brother Gary you didn't hear me
[1:01:41] talking about you want to go
[1:01:43] like I'm walking in
[1:01:46] yeah
[1:01:47] yeah
[1:01:50] he can go back and listen to what I'd
[1:01:52] say about him
[1:01:55] I'll do him like we used to do I don't
[1:01:57] know how many of you remember Bill
[1:01:58] Cunningham but he was a mess and
[1:02:02] all you had to say to him was that well
[1:02:04] I got something but I'm going to tell
[1:02:05] you now I'll tell you later
[1:02:08] and he'd bug you to death about what
[1:02:11] you'd said every time you're telling me
[1:02:13] don't do me that away that's the way
[1:02:15] we'll do you that way okay
[1:02:17] but now think about it
[1:02:21] if he's a Trion being just like I'm a
[1:02:24] throne being
[1:02:26] is there any problem to think about God
[1:02:28] it's Body Spirit and soul
[1:02:33] why would we want to think any other way
[1:02:37] you know
[1:02:40] the body came
[1:02:42] by creation we know that
[1:02:45] when it came from the Virgin Mary
[1:02:47] all right
[1:02:49] well why can't we think that the spirit
[1:02:51] that came in him is the spirit of
[1:02:53] almighty God
[1:02:55] that anointing that anointed all of
[1:02:58] those people back through the Old
[1:02:59] Testament the time why not
[1:03:02] and when I think that the soul
[1:03:04] is the very not just the soul of God but
[1:03:08] it's the very Soul God himself because
[1:03:10] Soul means person and being and what you
[1:03:12] are
[1:03:14] that was God manifested in flesh
[1:03:18] but see the River Jordan people said he
[1:03:20] was just a man so that would mean he's
[1:03:22] got a body from God and a spirit from
[1:03:24] God and a soul from God and then all at
[1:03:26] once he got anointed and he become God
[1:03:28] then God took anointing back off only
[1:03:31] become a man and he died within that
[1:03:33] body and spirit and soul and that didn't
[1:03:35] wouldn't do you no good
[1:03:39] come on
[1:03:42] but what about
[1:03:43] do we really believe it
[1:03:48] do we believe that he would say one day
[1:03:50] into thy hand I commend my spirit
[1:03:53] would we believe that he would say as
[1:03:56] we'll get on further in the message my
[1:03:58] soul is troubled
[1:04:02] that he could speak about a soul the
[1:04:04] body and a spirit of himself
[1:04:09] but you're just making him too real I
[1:04:12] wish I could make him so real until you
[1:04:14] could see him
[1:04:19] because one way or the other one day we
[1:04:21] will see him
[1:04:22] either sitting on a throne to judge us
[1:04:24] to send us to hell for rejecting the
[1:04:26] word or either we will be standing there
[1:04:28] as his bride with him
[1:04:31] one way or the other is going to be
[1:04:34] what about this statement that he would
[1:04:36] make no to number seven
[1:04:39] this is taken from Jesus Christ the same
[1:04:41] yesterday day and forever reasons 61.
[1:04:44] once now he is alive today
[1:04:50] soul body and spirit
[1:04:54] he is alive
[1:04:58] okay
[1:04:59] who was that that raised
[1:05:02] we talk about last weekend look what he
[1:05:05] says
[1:05:06] he is alive today soul body and spirit
[1:05:09] he's alive that's the theme of our
[1:05:11] conventions
[1:05:14] always is Jesus Christ the same
[1:05:16] yesterday today and forever
[1:05:20] then do you believe that he was almighty
[1:05:22] God that walked on the shore to Galilee
[1:05:24] or a second person or a or a um
[1:05:28] demon god
[1:05:30] which means another God in another form
[1:05:33] because if you're saying that he wasn't
[1:05:35] god Till The River Jordan then you're
[1:05:36] making him a demon god you're making him
[1:05:38] another God somewhere is this called
[1:05:39] according to my Bible it says that
[1:05:42] God
[1:05:46] was talking to people
[1:05:48] there are 13 years of age
[1:05:51] that a prophet would say what about your
[1:05:53] God with no teeth
[1:05:57] what you see
[1:05:59] but those people have the anointings
[1:06:01] with them and their soul and the people
[1:06:03] that are they're dwelling with have they
[1:06:05] go by the anointings and that's what
[1:06:07] carries them and it guides them well and
[1:06:10] then you've watched it throughout the
[1:06:11] years that you've been around the
[1:06:12] message you've seen them they run good
[1:06:14] for a while and boy everything's good
[1:06:16] you know all at once they just start
[1:06:18] dwindling down
[1:06:20] you know
[1:06:22] but then there's another guy comes up
[1:06:24] and they just well they grab on that
[1:06:26] bandwagon and they're they're just going
[1:06:28] with it well I just never have found no
[1:06:31] bandwagon yet
[1:06:32] you know I just keep on going like I am
[1:06:37] but can you believe what he would say
[1:06:38] about it
[1:06:45] in spirit he's alive
[1:06:52] well where's his body
[1:06:54] according to the Bible it's
[1:06:56] sitting on the throne
[1:07:00] words is Spirit according to the Bible
[1:07:02] it's here to lead and guide everyone
[1:07:05] else just like it was in the Old
[1:07:06] Testament where is his soul according to
[1:07:09] the Bible and the prophet is supposed to
[1:07:11] be hearing You and I by the new birth
[1:07:17] but it's always been all in my life that
[1:07:19] God is The Spirit Well then grandma was
[1:07:21] okay
[1:07:26] but you remember brother Brown was
[1:07:27] saying Mama might have believed it but
[1:07:29] we're in a different day now
[1:07:33] you know we appreciate what Mom and
[1:07:35] Grandma and them believed
[1:07:38] but if they didn't believe the truth
[1:07:40] it's not the truth they don't make it
[1:07:42] the truth because Grandma believes it
[1:07:44] of course we're all little kids we
[1:07:45] always believed that didn't we all
[1:07:47] grandma was the best cooks he was the
[1:07:49] best man she was doing with life and
[1:07:51] talking the other day going down the
[1:07:52] road my mother dipped snuff and and man
[1:07:54] I said little kids you know we'd be out
[1:07:56] in the field picking cotton he got stung
[1:07:58] by uh packs or they call them pack
[1:08:00] saddles or something and the man them
[1:08:02] things would kill you you're picking
[1:08:04] your cotton they just get on your hand
[1:08:05] boy you're this thing you would go
[1:08:07] running to Mama
[1:08:08] mama had that stuff and you stepping on
[1:08:11] that thing and
[1:08:13] you went on about your day cause it quit
[1:08:15] hurting
[1:08:17] well it had some good sides to it okay
[1:08:22] but that's all right I'm not encouraging
[1:08:26] dipping snuff
[1:08:30] but I I am like nanny said she's she's
[1:08:33] explaining that let me put it in my
[1:08:35] words what's the difference in keeping
[1:08:37] an alavor leaf and which one is it
[1:08:42] the leaf and you can rub on what's there
[1:08:44] keep it out of keeping your box of stuff
[1:08:46] sitting up in the cabinet
[1:08:48] it quit hurting
[1:08:51] I Ain't Gonna Get No Stuff that's okay
[1:08:53] forget it
[1:08:57] but listen folks
[1:09:01] what do you believe about God
[1:09:04] gets you to kind of shook where you want
[1:09:07] look what he says in number eight they
[1:09:09] were on our notes where it's taken from
[1:09:11] and north at not which is 1965.
[1:09:15] he's coming down explaining the three
[1:09:17] rings you know what you're drawing
[1:09:19] that's God God in a Trinity is One
[1:09:23] and without a trinity he's not God
[1:09:29] now here's a man that doesn't believe in
[1:09:31] a trinity and said the word turn
[1:09:37] ing look what he's explaining
[1:09:40] all right all right
[1:09:43] he can't be
[1:09:45] manifested any other way
[1:09:49] father son holy ghost He that's the
[1:09:52] three attributes of God all the rest of
[1:09:54] them is healer and savior and deliver
[1:09:56] and Etc it's all in that three
[1:09:58] attributes
[1:10:00] but without any of those after you take
[1:10:02] away one of them he's not complete
[1:10:05] and neither can you be manifested
[1:10:07] without being the Trinity person that
[1:10:09] you are that's Body Spirit and soul
[1:10:11] without either one of them you're not
[1:10:13] complete see you don't have a soul you'd
[1:10:15] be nothing you didn't have a excuse me
[1:10:18] you didn't have a soul you'd be nothing
[1:10:19] you didn't have a spirit you would be
[1:10:21] nothing you didn't have a body
[1:10:24] you just be a spirit not a body so God
[1:10:27] is complete in the triunity
[1:10:31] of a being
[1:10:34] all right not try Unity of beings
[1:10:41] not three beings
[1:10:43] one being manifested in the middle of
[1:10:45] life but one being in a triunity father
[1:10:48] son the Holy Ghost
[1:10:50] is one true manifested God
[1:10:54] all right
[1:10:55] but we understand the godhead brother
[1:10:57] Dale we need to do oh yeah we need to
[1:10:58] get these deep things
[1:11:03] yeah
[1:11:05] it's okay no problems
[1:11:09] look what he goes on to say in number
[1:11:11] nine which is works his faith expressed
[1:11:13] 1965.
[1:11:15] now remember you're in a shackle of
[1:11:18] three
[1:11:18] but you're one person
[1:11:20] like Father Son and Holy Ghost cycle of
[1:11:22] tree but one person
[1:11:24] three attributes are the same God
[1:11:27] fatherhood three officers like
[1:11:29] fatherhood sonship and Holy Ghost
[1:11:32] and you are Body Spirit and soul
[1:11:35] now the outside of the body has five
[1:11:37] thousands unconscious of me he goes down
[1:11:39] to explain to where you live right all
[1:11:42] right
[1:11:44] but see you're one person
[1:11:50] he's one person
[1:11:53] with many many manifestations
[1:11:57] one person
[1:12:01] look what he says on the unveiling of
[1:12:02] God number 10.
[1:12:04] got all the fullness all the godhead
[1:12:06] bodily was in this person Jesus Christ
[1:12:10] he was God and God Alone not a third
[1:12:14] person or a second person or a first
[1:12:17] person
[1:12:18] but the person
[1:12:20] veiled in human flesh
[1:12:27] do you understand it before we make a
[1:12:29] few more readings of things that were
[1:12:31] said and we've used them before but do
[1:12:34] you understand what I'm saying
[1:12:37] to God to reveal it to you but you
[1:12:39] understand what I'm saying
[1:12:41] that
[1:12:43] as a human being we are Body Spirit and
[1:12:46] soul it takes that to make a human being
[1:12:49] all right
[1:12:50] without either one of them we would be
[1:12:52] missing a part and it wouldn't work
[1:12:54] all right without father-son and Holy
[1:12:57] Ghost he cannot be
[1:12:59] the true God
[1:13:01] that's why we're not a trinity and why
[1:13:03] we're not a one let's see
[1:13:05] but we hold to that it ain't like the
[1:13:08] Bible says you know uh
[1:13:11] baptized in the name of the father
[1:13:14] another son the Holy Ghost
[1:13:16] then Peter says in the name of Jesus
[1:13:18] Christ and we say I've heard people in
[1:13:20] this message saying you know way back
[1:13:22] years ago
[1:13:24] we take Acts 2 38 for our baptism they
[1:13:28] take Matthew 28 19. no way that's wrong
[1:13:31] if they took Matthew 28 19 to get
[1:13:34] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:13:35] Christ
[1:13:36] because father-son Holy Ghost has no
[1:13:38] names you can't be baptized that away
[1:13:40] it's got to be the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:13:42] right all right so now if we believe
[1:13:46] that we as human Mortals are a triome
[1:13:49] being
[1:13:51] Body Spirit and soul
[1:13:54] why can't we believe God would be in a
[1:13:56] Triumph being of Body Spirit and soul
[1:14:00] because you see church with a you know
[1:14:01] like I said whether you believe it or
[1:14:03] not that's up to you but that's the only
[1:14:05] way I can see one God
[1:14:08] and see it correctly but either you see
[1:14:11] you're going to the Oneness side or
[1:14:13] you're going to go to the Trinity side
[1:14:16] I mean
[1:14:18] and the god in three persons Blessed
[1:14:20] Trinity is not the middle now come on
[1:14:23] that's over on the Trinity side
[1:14:25] right
[1:14:28] it's not you say well boy we got the
[1:14:30] middle right because we got God's Reaper
[1:14:31] there's no such thing as God in three
[1:14:33] persons
[1:14:37] person is personality personality is
[1:14:39] individual individual is a person you're
[1:14:41] right back into the trinitarian concept
[1:14:44] but do you see when that baby was born
[1:14:48] the Bible said born this city born this
[1:14:51] day in the city of David is a savior
[1:14:55] okay that deals with the body making the
[1:14:58] price but you got to get to the soul to
[1:15:00] be in the Savior part but body making
[1:15:02] the price
[1:15:05] born this day in the city today is a
[1:15:07] savior which is Christ the lord
[1:15:11] as we read do you think they would have
[1:15:13] killed him had they known that he was
[1:15:14] The Lord Of Glory
[1:15:16] no
[1:15:19] but he had to die that a way to release
[1:15:21] the life
[1:15:25] because within him was that now
[1:15:28] anointings can come on people and it
[1:15:30] could come on people while he was here
[1:15:34] right right it did cough us it
[1:15:37] prophesied that Jesus would have to die
[1:15:38] for the sins or one without to die for
[1:15:40] the sins of the people
[1:15:42] what do you see what one true and living
[1:15:44] God then would be
[1:15:47] body a man
[1:15:52] bruh spirit
[1:15:55] and I'll be glad to find this one before
[1:15:57] he Brethren said his very Spirits 100
[1:15:58] times and divers matter that anointed
[1:16:00] those Prophets
[1:16:01] but you ought to be able to believe that
[1:16:03] because what would it be if it's just a
[1:16:05] mortal Spirit then you have no God
[1:16:09] and you can't say that God came himself
[1:16:13] he'd be sending somebody else
[1:16:16] I thought that's what we believed
[1:16:22] so then that man that walks ashore's
[1:16:23] real Galilee and body he was a man yeah
[1:16:25] but a special creation
[1:16:29] not like any other man but a special
[1:16:30] creation but in the image or form of
[1:16:32] looking like the rest of the creation
[1:16:35] all right
[1:16:37] don't you believe that that would have
[1:16:38] been the body that he would have been in
[1:16:40] had they not been a fall
[1:16:46] are you going to leave it that we're
[1:16:47] just supposed to be something out here
[1:16:49] and we're having a good time but he's
[1:16:50] still floating around lonely
[1:16:53] I don't think that way
[1:16:55] all right but think about it
[1:16:59] embody a human being
[1:17:02] a man as we call it
[1:17:05] we're referring to the 16 elements
[1:17:07] called the flesh
[1:17:10] but in spirit that was the spirit and
[1:17:12] Sunday times and diverse manner to speak
[1:17:13] to those prophets back there
[1:17:16] Indian Soul he was the very being of
[1:17:19] almighty God
[1:17:22] you got you one God correct
[1:17:24] and you got it to where he could say I
[1:17:26] and my father are one
[1:17:29] but then he could turn around and said
[1:17:30] if you've seen me you've seen the father
[1:17:35] because it's one
[1:17:38] a father a human a being you know many
[1:17:41] titles but how many people am I
[1:17:47] we'll see maybe we're to consider the
[1:17:49] fact of thinking about that sure we
[1:17:52] started off this situation by being in
[1:17:54] His image
[1:17:57] but then what would that mean he looked
[1:18:00] like
[1:18:08] then we're not in His image
[1:18:11] because his image wound up being God in
[1:18:13] human flesh I thought that was what the
[1:18:17] new birth was supposed to bring
[1:18:21] God living in you and I the only problem
[1:18:24] we have to
[1:18:30] okay
[1:18:34] so then let's get this
[1:18:36] a few of them and look what he says
[1:18:39] in the message I am the resurrection he
[1:18:41] spread around said in flesh he was human
[1:18:44] but his spirit
[1:18:46] but he
[1:18:48] but is his Spirit he was God
[1:18:51] oh now you think I might have read that
[1:18:53] wrong because it's not it is his Spirit
[1:18:54] he probably was meaning in his Spirit
[1:18:56] but that's up to him in flesh he was
[1:18:58] human but in his Spirit he was God I
[1:19:01] said he cried
[1:19:03] that was a man crying
[1:19:05] that was a man when he was crying going
[1:19:07] down the Lazarus gray but when he stood
[1:19:10] there and straightened that little frame
[1:19:11] up and said Lazarus come forth and a man
[1:19:14] that's been dead four days come to life
[1:19:15] again that was no more than a man that
[1:19:18] was God speaking truth or Hallelujah God
[1:19:21] was in his son that was God speaking
[1:19:23] through mortal flesh corruption knew its
[1:19:26] Master Okay number 12 looking for Jesus
[1:19:30] 54.
[1:19:33] he was a human he was a human as far as
[1:19:36] being flesh he was a human in spirit he
[1:19:39] was God but as flesh he was the son of
[1:19:41] God you believe that don't you because
[1:19:43] you're a Christian
[1:19:45] 13.
[1:19:48] The Darkest Hour Jesus came 56.
[1:19:52] 55.
[1:19:53] see pulled from him talking about the
[1:19:55] woman you know
[1:19:56] the weakness Verger through that human
[1:19:59] body of his because he was just a man
[1:20:01] born of a woman but his father was God
[1:20:05] but in his body he was a man in his
[1:20:08] spirit
[1:20:09] he was God
[1:20:11] all right
[1:20:13] do we believe that
[1:20:16] no there was a spirit up yonder
[1:20:18] somewhere
[1:20:20] we'll get down to it eventually where
[1:20:22] we're talking about the Kinsmen Redeemer
[1:20:24] no
[1:20:26] all right calling Jesus on the scene
[1:20:28] remember in flesh he was just a man but
[1:20:31] in spirit he was God
[1:20:33] but a man in flesh therefore his body
[1:20:36] was a human being that was subject to
[1:20:38] Temptations subject to sicknesses just
[1:20:42] the same as ours all right
[1:20:45] calling Jesus on the scene 63.
[1:20:50] she's saying how could he be God and a
[1:20:52] man
[1:20:53] see there is the mystery
[1:20:58] look
[1:21:00] see in body he was a man
[1:21:03] in spirit he was God he called it a
[1:21:06] mystery you know I always thought a
[1:21:08] mystery had to be revealed if not it's
[1:21:10] still a mystery God keeps him keeps his
[1:21:13] word 57.
[1:21:15] yeah
[1:21:17] he's talking about the blood and the
[1:21:19] Fulfillment of the word he said I
[1:21:20] believe in body he was a man I believe
[1:21:22] in his soul he was God
[1:21:28] he was God's manifestation here on Earth
[1:21:31] God in Christ reconciling the world to
[1:21:34] himself
[1:21:35] I believe that he was not just a mere
[1:21:38] man
[1:21:39] neither was he a prophet he was God
[1:21:42] Emmanuel I believe with all of my heart
[1:21:45] that be in truth I can't prove that
[1:21:48] truth because if I could then it
[1:21:52] wouldn't be of faith
[1:21:58] God you've got to believe it right
[1:22:02] when Christ died he committed his Spirit
[1:22:05] taken from the thy house number 19 if
[1:22:08] they catch up with me reading when
[1:22:10] Christ died he committed his Spirit to
[1:22:12] God before he left the the cross he said
[1:22:15] into thy hands I commend my spirit and
[1:22:17] the Bible said his soul went to hell and
[1:22:20] preached that's his conscience and what
[1:22:23] he was to the spirits was in prison and
[1:22:27] his body went to the Grave
[1:22:29] he said after three days the barricade
[1:22:31] was taken away because the scripture
[1:22:34] said his Spirit went to the soul and
[1:22:36] soul went to the body and he rose
[1:22:39] he didn't go for something else to try
[1:22:41] to find it
[1:22:43] I thought we believed it brought around
[1:22:44] and said your Resurrection is were
[1:22:48] I thought he said it was in US
[1:22:52] the message every present water from The
[1:22:54] Rock
[1:22:55] he was here on Earth
[1:22:57] when he died his soul descended into
[1:22:59] hell and preached the spirits that were
[1:23:01] in prison the souls in prison they
[1:23:03] repented not in long-suffering of the
[1:23:04] days of Noah his body went into the
[1:23:06] grave but before he died he commended
[1:23:09] his Spirit into the hands of God his
[1:23:10] Spirit went to God his soul went to hell
[1:23:12] and his body went to the grave and Jesus
[1:23:15] was barred out from Resurrection until
[1:23:17] the scripture could be fulfilled he
[1:23:20] could not come back because he had to
[1:23:22] stay in the grave for three days a night
[1:23:24] but when the scripture were all full
[1:23:27] authentic fulfilled this bar was taken
[1:23:30] away his Spirit descended to his soul
[1:23:31] his soul to his body and he rose again
[1:23:34] all right
[1:23:36] thank God right Jesus Christ the same
[1:23:38] yesterday today in Forever 61. when
[1:23:40] Jesus died at Calvary we know that his
[1:23:42] soul went to hell his body went to the
[1:23:44] Grave his Spirit went to God and Calvary
[1:23:46] said unto thy hands I come in my spirit
[1:23:48] and his Spirit went to God the Father
[1:23:50] into his hands the Bible said his soul
[1:23:53] he he went to hell and preached to the
[1:23:55] to the ones was in prison that repented
[1:23:58] not in the long-suffering of the days of
[1:24:00] Noah going down in entombment 57. here
[1:24:05] he goes where did he leave when he left
[1:24:09] the Bible said he ascended he went and
[1:24:12] preached to the spirit Souls that were
[1:24:14] in prison that repented not in a long
[1:24:16] suffering in the days of Noah he sold
[1:24:18] his Spirit his theophany of his own
[1:24:20] being went down
[1:24:22] let's follow him he said all right God's
[1:24:24] provided way of approach to Fellowship
[1:24:27] he said did you know God lived in a
[1:24:29] three-room house
[1:24:35] and we'll take up right here this
[1:24:36] evening
[1:24:39] did you know God lived in a three-room
[1:24:41] house
[1:24:43] you know that everything I've got them
[1:24:45] if you want to quote everything you go
[1:24:47] back Run free room just run um
[1:24:51] three-room house or three room
[1:24:53] into your computer and watch what he
[1:24:54] comes up with
[1:24:57] you know that even in the Old Testaments
[1:24:59] he'd had to be out of court in a court
[1:25:00] holy holy
[1:25:03] and you can't explain it without it
[1:25:05] being a revelation but there's only two
[1:25:07] veils
[1:25:11] Don't Preach revealed folks you get it
[1:25:14] wrong
[1:25:15] there's two veils outer Court one Veil
[1:25:18] inner Court
[1:25:19] innovail holy of holies there's only two
[1:25:22] values
[1:25:23] you say well you got to get on no you
[1:25:25] you get to three and what you do look
[1:25:27] what did you know that God lived in a
[1:25:29] three-room house you live in a
[1:25:31] three-room house you dwell in three room
[1:25:33] house God dwelt in Christ soul body and
[1:25:37] spirit
[1:25:40] oh
[1:25:42] you live soul body and spirit you live
[1:25:45] in a house of your own here on Earth you
[1:25:48] remember how he was explaining that you
[1:25:49] can have 14 bedrooms but you only got
[1:25:51] three rooms in your house you can have a
[1:25:53] hundred rooms but you only got three
[1:25:55] rooms you got a living room but what is
[1:25:58] it it's parlor and in the bedroom all
[1:26:02] right
[1:26:02] but said do you know that God lived in a
[1:26:05] prayer room now
[1:26:08] look what he says that when we get to
[1:26:11] and when we die taken from the
[1:26:13] ever-present water from The Rock
[1:26:15] our souls will go under the altar of God
[1:26:17] where I was privileged to see a few
[1:26:19] mornings ago as you know in division
[1:26:21] where the Bible speaks of our spirits
[1:26:24] will go to God who give it and our
[1:26:25] bodies will return to the dust of the
[1:26:28] Earth but someday when the scripture is
[1:26:30] fulfilled our spirit will be released
[1:26:32] from God will pick up the soul and the
[1:26:35] soul to the body and the power that
[1:26:37] raises us up is right in us now
[1:26:42] we're in Heavenly places
[1:26:44] look at the next perfect strength by
[1:26:46] Perfect weakness
[1:26:48] and make a complete surrender
[1:26:52] we cannot use one ability
[1:26:55] we've got to make a complete surrender
[1:26:58] to come to God you've got to surrender
[1:27:00] to him both body soul body and spirit
[1:27:05] everything that you are has to be
[1:27:09] surrendered to God
[1:27:11] Body Spirit and soul
[1:27:14] that's where trouble's at
[1:27:18] we said well my soul is born again but
[1:27:20] what about our spirit and our body
[1:27:23] a lot more could be said right
[1:27:27] but what do you believe about God
[1:27:30] well he just sent somebody down and let
[1:27:33] them go do these things and yeah
[1:27:37] according to the prophet he came himself
[1:27:43] all right then why don't we think of him
[1:27:45] being
[1:27:46] body
[1:27:48] spirit and soul
[1:27:54] and that one of these days we'll see him
[1:27:56] like that
[1:27:57] foreign
[1:28:14] remember
[1:28:17] we're supposed to have been in the
[1:28:18] message long enough to learn a few
[1:28:20] things
[1:28:22] I know about your theophanese once you
[1:28:24] see in the times right
[1:28:26] but you know brother random saw Jesus
[1:28:30] am I correct
[1:28:33] and you know what he said about that
[1:28:35] Jesus
[1:28:36] he said as far as looking
[1:28:39] he looks the most like the Hoffman's
[1:28:41] head of Christ
[1:28:43] than anything he'd ever seen
[1:28:46] you ever seen some of the pictures of
[1:28:48] Jesus
[1:28:49] ugliest looking warped Up Mud you've
[1:28:51] ever seen
[1:28:55] my brother random said
[1:28:57] the Jesus he saw
[1:29:01] that Hoffman's head of Christ was the
[1:29:02] closest
[1:29:06] well now do you think he saw theophany
[1:29:08] okay
[1:29:09] but who'd it look like
[1:29:15] brother random was beyond the curtain of
[1:29:17] time he might not have recognized those
[1:29:20] people immediately upon who they were in
[1:29:23] relation but once he was told
[1:29:27] who they were
[1:29:34] he recognized
[1:29:37] oh he even recognized his dog
[1:29:43] he even recognized his horse
[1:29:48] he recognized his wife
[1:29:58] it'll look like when we get out of here
[1:30:01] that's why the board is downstairs with
[1:30:04] the people that are about 18 20 years of
[1:30:07] age or somewhere the closest we can get
[1:30:08] to that that has passed on
[1:30:11] you know probably as much as I knew
[1:30:13] brother Tatum my sister Tatum I'd
[1:30:14] probably recognize him but still might
[1:30:16] have a little trouble in a young age
[1:30:19] maybe some of you saw him in young age
[1:30:20] and you'd recognize them quicker not one
[1:30:22] of those pictures I came up with that
[1:30:24] idea for about 20 years ago 30 years ago
[1:30:27] to put everybody you know what if you
[1:30:29] die I'll put your picture up there
[1:30:32] you know if I die I hope you put mine
[1:30:36] because there ain't no pictures of me
[1:30:40] the closest picture you'll find to me is
[1:30:42] me standing out in the yard hanging
[1:30:44] diapers up on a clothesline
[1:30:46] in about 20 years of age
[1:30:50] and no shirt on well I had a physique
[1:30:53] man
[1:30:55] because my waist was about 31 and it
[1:30:59] never got no bigger the higher you went
[1:31:02] so I was a bean Pole
[1:31:06] right
[1:31:07] but you see I believe in the
[1:31:09] resurrection we're going to see those
[1:31:10] people that know who they are
[1:31:12] they're not going to have to introduce
[1:31:13] themselves
[1:31:15] that was just a thought that came to my
[1:31:17] mind I want to be able to see them oh
[1:31:19] brother Jimmy Gibson we put his picture
[1:31:21] down there
[1:31:24] and we have seen him in his life
[1:31:27] but when he's about 18 20 years old he
[1:31:30] nice looking young guy
[1:31:34] but you see what I'm talking about do
[1:31:36] you see what I believe
[1:31:39] I believe that when Jesus walked on this
[1:31:42] Earth
[1:31:43] that that body
[1:31:45] was a creation by the word Hebrews 10 5.
[1:31:49] that spirit that was within him that's
[1:31:51] why may I quote wrote around him and
[1:31:53] said he said that's why he knew things
[1:31:58] it was the spirit that was within him
[1:31:59] that was back there
[1:32:02] in the Old Testament speaking through
[1:32:04] those Prophets
[1:32:06] but then there was a being
[1:32:09] that mankind had missed the mystery of
[1:32:13] what he would be
[1:32:15] and they killed him
[1:32:19] can we do the same today
[1:32:23] do you realize
[1:32:24] if we don't accept the truth
[1:32:28] of God in his ways that we are
[1:32:30] crucifying him again
[1:32:34] so let me believe it
[1:32:37] thank God enough sense Lord just letting
[1:32:39] me believe it
[1:32:44] see that way then I ain't tied together
[1:32:46] with every scripture in the Bible
[1:32:48] I don't have to deny anything
[1:32:51] I don't have to say he was wrong here
[1:32:53] and right over here
[1:32:57] I can take a whole message in the Bible
[1:32:59] and it'll tie together never had no
[1:33:01] problems with it
[1:33:04] well I just don't see it the way you see
[1:33:05] it okay just pray for me
[1:33:08] all right
[1:33:10] ain't trying to make nobody believe
[1:33:11] anything
[1:33:13] come on brother
[1:33:15] I'm trying to make nobody believe
[1:33:16] anything
[1:33:18] you take away people's three more ages
[1:33:19] three more agency when you try to make
[1:33:21] them believe it
[1:33:24] the only thing I've ever told you about
[1:33:26] anything I said you can come here and
[1:33:27] believe what you want to but just don't
[1:33:29] try to bring it among the people
[1:33:32] then you'll get me to order I'll say
[1:33:34] something about it
[1:33:36] because I'm the pastor
[1:33:39] sorry
[1:33:40] you know
[1:33:41] I don't want to do that
[1:33:44] but I have to be that I'll tell you what
[1:33:47] I believe and I'll tell you why I don't
[1:33:50] believe those things
[1:33:55] but you tell me why you don't believe
[1:33:57] them
[1:34:01] that's all I ask you to do
[1:34:05] you come up here I'll let women all you
[1:34:08] have this evening and sister if you can
[1:34:10] explain God in some other better way
[1:34:11] than Body Spirit and soul
