[10:07] the Bible said and be able to withstand
[10:09] the bride of Jesus Christ we just got to
[10:12] believe it yeah I'm good to be in the
[10:14] house of the Lord I was gonna make an
[10:16] announcement now brother Lewis and his
[10:21] wife are leaving to go to Nicaragua
[10:24] Honduras anyhow he's going to minister
[10:28] all right now this is what we do when a
[10:31] brother is going from here to a foreign
[10:33] country to preach we pay his expenses to
[10:39] go now I'm talking about the ticket
[10:41] expenses you talking about all the
[10:44] spending is what he does that we paid
[10:46] but for him only not for the wife now so
[10:49] what we're gonna do is give brother
[10:52] Louie's money today far Lisa's
[10:55] instructed to find out what the ticket
[10:57] cost would be for the expenses of the
[11:00] tickets over to where he's going not for
[11:03] her now cause make that plane see some
[11:05] people don't hear the second time you
[11:07] say things they only hear the first well
[11:10] I didn't hear that but that's alright MC
[11:14] Wade will be paid then in like March I
[11:17] think he's going to the Philippines and
[11:20] his ticket for the hour will be paid not
[11:22] for tunes I think she's going with him
[11:24] but it will be for the minister only and
[11:26] when they're going to preach now if
[11:28] you're going on vacation no no no no no
[11:30] and that's foreign countries that's not
[11:33] because you're going to Cleveland
[11:36] Tennessee to preach for them this
[11:38] foreign countries will pay the ticket of
[11:41] the one who's doing the ministering
[11:43] alright but now we always do this so I
[11:47] asked you if you'd like to we won't pass
[11:50] the plate won't do anything but if you
[11:52] want to give a brother the lease
[11:53] something as an offering that's up to
[11:58] you
[11:58] that'll be your part see the church pays
[12:00] the expenses of the ticket that's not
[12:03] out of your pocket so if you want to
[12:06] give something to brother Louise to help
[12:09] him as his ministering and going you
[12:13] feel free to do it
[12:14] but we always invite you to do that okay
[12:16] does everybody understand and that way
[12:19] if you do then give him the money
[12:20] himself to where you can pay the
[12:23] expenses we appreciate these brothers
[12:24] going you know but we can't supply
[12:27] everything so we do what we can and give
[12:30] what a little bit we can to do those
[12:33] things as I say in this morning we will
[12:35] be held responsible because of that
[12:39] unbelievers the heathen that doesn't
[12:41] hear so if these brothers go and try to
[12:44] minister to those then the money you're
[12:47] giving is helping them to be able to go
[12:50] so okay all right just make sure you do
[12:52] that all right

[16:14] doing good so he said say hello and and
[16:17] the Lord bless you so let's turn the
[16:19] bibles to revelations chapter 6 and
[16:21] we're going to start now this is going
[16:23] to be first seal part 1 we're not going
[16:26] to get the the board out today because I
[16:31] kind of picked up another thought last
[16:34] night on some things that we were
[16:35] talking about and what brother Dale and
[16:37] I were talking about this morning and I
[16:40] kind of want to get that out of the way
[16:41] before we start into the symbols because
[16:44] remember when we read this revelation
[16:48] 6:1 that that was a that was a scene
[16:52] that happened
[16:53] in front of John right it was a scene
[16:56] that happened in front of John because
[16:59] physically you're never gonna see a man
[17:02] on a white horse with a bow and a crown
[17:05] you know you're not gonna see a physical
[17:08] happening of that so it's a parable and
[17:11] actor it's symbols so I said he was John
[17:15] was commissioned to write what he saw
[17:17] well when when the angel said come and
[17:19] see john wrote 'we saw he saw a wild
[17:23] horse rider and he saw sitting on that
[17:25] horse it was a man sitting on the horse
[17:28] and he had a bow and he was given a
[17:31] crown we've been through that before
[17:33] that powell was given this whoever this
[17:36] person is has no power to start with if
[17:38] will realize that we won't have to
[17:40] preach these seals too much
[17:41] hey ma'am he didn't have any power he
[17:44] had to get on a horse right he was given
[17:49] power to do these things
[17:51] all right so they like brother Gary
[17:52] action says who gives them the power to
[17:54] do it we do we're the ones that giving
[17:57] the power I I want to kind of cover
[18:00] something in in Genesis because remember
[18:03] brother Brown said one seal tile the
[18:05] entire Bible together right cuz it's the
[18:07] book of redemption and that's what we're
[18:08] going to talk about remember all that
[18:10] background that we can went through
[18:11] several months ago of a foundation of
[18:15] for the seals all the seals together is
[18:18] one great revelation of who Jesus Christ
[18:21] not the devil
[18:22] now he's to be exposed or he's to be
[18:24] revealed now we're gonna read that in
[18:26] Thessalonians where he will be revealed
[18:27] but in his in his being made known of
[18:31] the devil what it does to me is is it
[18:35] puts him over here so that we can notice
[18:38] what he's doing because remember most
[18:41] people that are deceived and were
[18:43] reading in Thessalonians the devil is
[18:45] not out there he resides he resides and
[18:51] he listened in our spirit realm he
[18:54] resides a lot in ours so don't get so
[18:57] don't get so high in pious that we're
[18:59] talking about the denominational world
[19:01] no he he works he works in my members
[19:05] about as much as God does and I'll
[19:07] they say it works more than God does
[19:08] right ma'am right because we live a we
[19:12] live a common human life and and before
[19:14] the fall oh we get into its revelation 6
[19:17] first one you just pray for us that I'm
[19:21] going to take my time and and next
[19:24] Sunday we'll probably use the use the
[19:27] board when we go because the last thing
[19:29] I want to talk about is the symbols
[19:30] because what we're talking about to
[19:32] downstairs is you got to remember that
[19:34] that the seals were written or preached
[19:39] in Matthew 24 by the Lord Jesus himself
[19:42] so it's not something new it's not
[19:45] something that's not written that's why
[19:47] I want us to see that that the seal is
[19:49] written the thunders what was the
[19:52] unwritten part but yet it has to compare
[19:55] with every scripture in the Bible okay
[19:56] so we're gonna worry about the seal
[19:58] right here first we got to get the seal
[20:01] off so that we can see what's on the
[20:04] inside right okay so we gotta get the
[20:06] seal off first and that's what the
[20:08] prophets job was was to take that seal
[20:10] off
[20:10] hey man cuz it was sealed up and we'll
[20:13] talk about that in a minute so let's
[20:15] read revelation 6 first one not keep you
[20:16] standing let's go to ward and prayer the
[20:19] only father we pray Lord that you be the
[20:22] active participant Lord again in this
[20:23] service father we truly do we have a
[20:28] common life that's controlled a lot of
[20:29] times by by factors of of life and
[20:33] things that we live but you know that
[20:35] didn't bother you when you came down in
[20:36] human flesh you sure you had to eat you
[20:39] had to sleep all those different things
[20:41] but you had no guilty conscience because
[20:43] you knew who you was father I pray that
[20:45] our conscience will be that will be
[20:48] clean Lord and we'll read some of that
[20:49] maybe later on about condemnation Lord
[20:52] that the seal shows us I believe that
[20:55] there is no condemnation to the bride of
[20:57] Jesus Christ father we ask you to
[21:00] forgive us of our sins bless this day
[21:02] Lord be with the ones that are traveling
[21:03] brother Joe brother Bob out preaching
[21:07] for the brother there in Lawrenceville
[21:09] order I pray this you just touch them
[21:11] and give them strength forgive us of our
[21:13] sins bless this day and take care of us
[21:15] anoint us for the job all of us have a
[21:17] job to do Lord not just the anointing up
[21:19] here but Lord made
[21:21] or that everyone brought their little
[21:23] lick of fire and Lord maybe we put them
[21:25] together and there'll be one great big
[21:27] flame father we pray this you just touch
[21:30] us now be with us in this journey take
[21:33] care of us in this time of the year Lord
[21:35] where it's hustle and bustle and people
[21:37] running to and fro and Lord just settle
[21:39] us down for a few few hours here on
[21:42] Sunday and winds then let us hear from
[21:44] you Lord because truly you did come here
[21:47] for a purpose
[21:48] you didn't just you've done just one
[21:50] wasn't born a baby so we could give
[21:52] Christmas gifts you were born to give
[21:54] the greatest gift and that was a way
[21:56] back to the eternal life that we
[21:58] inherited before the foundation of the
[22:00] world probably give us this day our
[22:02] daily bread in Jesus name we pray amen
[22:05] that's what I think about Christmas I
[22:07] love Christmastime I love give gifts but
[22:09] the greatest gift was that that God came
[22:11] himself to get us to make us a way back
[22:13] you know he didn't come to bring us
[22:16] inheritance like we were brother bands
[22:17] he didn't come to bring us our
[22:18] inheritance he came to make us a way to
[22:20] get back to it our inheritance was the
[22:22] eternal life before the foundation of
[22:23] the world amen the revelation six first
[22:26] one and I want to tell you something
[22:27] about that remember on these seals
[22:29] remember and we'll get into in just a
[22:30] minute but I want to put this point in
[22:31] for you to think about it these seals
[22:35] are the most important thing we'll every
[22:38] ever ever have to contend with in this
[22:42] hour you hear what I said in this hour
[22:44] because everybody from Paul Paul I'm
[22:48] sure he probably spoke a few times on
[22:50] Revelation chapter 6
[22:52] maybe I probably are probably not John
[22:56] John wrote it after probably Paul was
[22:58] dead so but Paul had a revelation
[23:01] because the seals are in the Old
[23:03] Testament because if it'll tie Evert
[23:06] infants however scripture together then
[23:08] you can go back to genesis exodus
[23:09] leviticus and all those and bring the
[23:11] seals which we may do later on but Paul
[23:13] never come under this part of having to
[23:16] take a body change Iranians never comin
[23:18] all the way down even even the
[23:20] Pentecostal age that we come out of but
[23:24] we need that so so don't think that I'm
[23:27] saying that this this and I'll get into
[23:30] in a minute it's something to that that
[23:32] I really I'm going
[23:34] bear heavy on the breaking of the seals
[23:36] is really not for your soul
[23:42] Paul was born again without knowing the
[23:44] seals I read in she was born again
[23:45] without knowing the seal
[23:46] everybody everybody from Paul to to even
[23:50] today that hadn't heard it you're born
[23:53] again by the shed blood of Jesus Christ
[23:54] that's in your soul these seals are a
[23:58] move-up and we'll read it in just a
[24:00] minute where brother when I'm comfort on
[24:01] the first hitter so move up its to move
[24:04] up to get that spirit realm in line with
[24:07] that soul to get the body change and man
[24:09] so this that's why brother Brown said it
[24:11] was the most one of the most important
[24:13] and the most spiritual realm he'd ever
[24:15] worked in why because it was aligning us
[24:17] to where we can take a body change
[24:19] alright and I saw when the lamb opened
[24:21] one of the seals and I heard it was the
[24:23] noise of thunder one of the four beasts
[24:25] saying come and see and I saw him behold
[24:28] a white horse and he that sat on him had
[24:30] a bow and a crown was given unto him and
[24:32] he went forth conquering and to conquer
[24:34] you may be seated in the Lord at his
[24:36] blessing now remember - we're talking
[24:38] about in the beginning God created man
[24:44] what in his own image now what is in a
[24:47] mirror image
[24:50] you got an image and then you got the
[24:52] real person thinking buddy appreciate
[24:54] you got the image and you've got the
[24:56] real thing because what's inside that
[24:58] mirror is not real it's an image of what
[25:02] is real alright so when we take these
[25:04] seals and we divide them up you're gonna
[25:06] see a reality here which is God and
[25:10] Satan is just an imposter he's trying to
[25:13] be an image I read it in Thessalonians
[25:17] he wants to be asked God he can't be he
[25:19] wants to be God but he can't be God he
[25:22] can't imitate everything except being
[25:25] that person of God Almighty he can't be
[25:29] that person but now you say well what
[25:31] about us well God I believes made a way
[25:34] if Jesus Christ if we're heirs and joint
[25:36] heirs with Christ I keep harping on that
[25:39] revelations eight we got to believe what
[25:41] the Bible says if we're heirs and joint
[25:43] heirs with Christ if he is standing
[25:46] we're in another dimension with a
[25:48] redeemed body that's what we get that's
[25:53] what we get we get the same thing not
[25:59] something lesser the same the same
[26:01] identical thing brother Nick likes the
[26:04] scripture if the same spirit that raised
[26:07] up Christ from the dead dwells in you so
[26:09] it can
[26:10] it'll quicken your mortal body about
[26:14] that spirit that dwells in you Matthew
[26:17] 24 verse 4 let's read this just get some
[26:23] of these scriptures out of the way it's
[26:24] not gonna be long today we've got
[26:25] communion this afternoon so we're going
[26:28] to got everything ready so we're gonna
[26:31] take communion after we get finished for
[26:33] this man Matthew 24 says and jesus
[26:35] answered and said unto them now this is
[26:37] where brother Branham picks up where
[26:39] they asked him you know the three
[26:40] questions in Matthew 24 verse 4 the
[26:42] prophet of God brings this in as the
[26:45] seals I believe it in the sixth seal he
[26:48] God reveals him that reveals the seals
[26:51] to that Jesus had already preached him
[26:54] alright but they will remember he what's
[26:56] he done he says look take heed that no
[26:58] man deceive you take heed in other words
[27:02] come and see notice take heed what's
[27:04] happening because we're gonna read
[27:06] Thessalonians and we're gonna read it
[27:07] kind of slow I've never seen some of
[27:09] this till I you know sometimes we read
[27:11] scripture we read script and we just
[27:15] read right through it and then if you go
[27:19] back and then you take every word or
[27:22] every even just a phrase and that phrase
[27:26] will tie things together that you've
[27:28] never seen before yet you've read second
[27:30] Thessalonians and you've read second
[27:32] Thessalonians and you've read second
[27:34] Thessalonians and brother Dale gets up
[27:36] and preached on 2nd Thessalonians and
[27:38] you'll go I just read that the other day
[27:39] and I didn't get anything why there's a
[27:41] seal so I'm saying about to sit there's
[27:44] a seal over your eyes there's something
[27:49] over your eyes not your eyes but your
[27:51] understanding that God being born-again
[27:55] like brother Peter told us being born
[27:58] again then your be
[28:00] what you're sealed until the day of your
[28:02] redemption amen but you uncie's seals
[28:05] have been unsealed the books been open
[28:08] all right so you and I ought to be able
[28:10] to understand and live the Bible says
[28:13] live by what every word that proceedeth
[28:15] out of the mouth of God so we're gonna
[28:17] try to keep this not reading many quotes
[28:19] but trying to keep this in the Bible is
[28:21] that all right and Jesus because this is
[28:24] where brother Branham got it he got out
[28:26] of the Bible and jesus answered and said
[28:27] unto them take heed that no man deceive
[28:29] you Michael somebody's going to all
[28:32] right for meaning not one or two passing
[28:35] by but many shall come in my name now
[28:41] wait a minute let's narrow this thing
[28:44] down the Baptist does not come in the
[28:48] name of Jesus Christ they come in the
[28:52] name of the Father in the name of the
[28:54] son in the name of the Holy Ghost and
[28:56] make this one the second person he's
[28:58] saying here for many shall come in my
[29:00] name
[29:01] in other words knowing who I am
[29:04] so I wrote down if some of you this got
[29:07] the notes I wrote the message because
[29:10] the message is the only thing that
[29:11] reveals the true name of God the man for
[29:17] many shall come in my name saying I am
[29:20] Christ and shall deceive a few it says
[29:25] many so many will be deceived in this
[29:30] first opening of the seal and we know
[29:32] the first seal when it's open in its
[29:35] entirety we see one true and living God
[29:37] we've already been let downstairs but
[29:39] we'll work our way into that all right
[29:41] for those of you that that was in the
[29:43] Sunday School class you know you some of
[29:44] you gonna sleep anyway so you might as
[29:46] well go ahead and sleep because you've
[29:49] already heard this but it's going to be
[29:50] in a little bit different form than we
[29:52] heard it downstairs all right so let's
[29:54] now turn to 2nd Thessalonians 2 I like
[29:57] Thessalonians it's a it's a good it's a
[30:00] good two two chapters to read second
[30:07] Thessalonians all right look now watch
[30:08] now listen we're going to break this
[30:09] down just for a minute to get us a basis
[30:13] of what's going on
[30:13] remember I want you to keep the word
[30:15] Redemption in your mind keep that word
[30:18] Redemption brother BAM said hold that
[30:19] word Redemption we read that not too
[30:21] long ago in other words hold on to that
[30:24] we're talking about Redemption we're
[30:27] going to talk about symbols and actors
[30:29] and what people did and what the boat
[30:31] stands for and what this stands for and
[30:32] what this stands for but you remember
[30:35] one thing as that is being made known or
[30:38] light is being shined on that it's doing
[30:41] something to me and you okay because
[30:44] look if Martin Luther see this is what I
[30:51] the Lord really impressed on me this
[30:53] like brother brems said if Martin Luther
[30:56] see Martin Luther the just shall live by
[30:58] faith he went to a pub and he drank beer
[31:01] he was a German Germans drink beer
[31:04] anyway they drink beer like we drink tea
[31:06] but he drank beer and smoked a pipe and
[31:09] talked about God well God was pleased
[31:12] with that revelation of that man at the
[31:13] time but now if you took Martin Luther
[31:17] though with the same Holy Ghost you got
[31:18] that's why I said that soul is sealed by
[31:22] what believing in the Lord Jesus Christ
[31:24] taking the word for your hour and
[31:26] brother Dale from that last night the
[31:28] new birth is not just the Holy Ghost you
[31:33] can be one anointed by the Holy Ghost
[31:35] every day and you live on your spirit
[31:36] and die and go to hell all right but you
[31:38] can never get the new birth and dying go
[31:41] to hell never never can you get the new
[31:44] birth you can never have a birth of the
[31:46] word that you hold onto and it quickens
[31:48] that word you can never go to hell that
[31:50] soul is sealed in and then then all
[31:53] right so Martin Luther though bring
[31:56] Martin Luther today set him in the pew
[31:59] he'd be on the front row and I promise
[32:00] you hit me at church more than most of
[32:02] y'all well the ones I'm talking to like
[32:05] Terrence said the other days if we've
[32:07] come with somebody people having to
[32:09] services and now they only have one he
[32:11] said well we've got people here that
[32:12] decided that a long time ago you'll get
[32:18] that in a minute
[32:20] and those of you that are not here are
[32:22] gonna get it again
[32:24] but anyway which is true but Martin
[32:27] Luther look at what he would do though
[32:29] he would take what's already in his soul
[32:31] and then he would absolutely at the
[32:34] moment quit thinking about drinking beer
[32:36] at the moment quit thinking about
[32:37] smoking the pot at the moment he would
[32:39] this word would absolutely you couldn't
[32:42] keep him you couldn't keep him like work
[32:43] with what brother Brown said if Paul
[32:44] came back here today in other words I'm
[32:47] gonna paraphrase that and heard what I'm
[32:48] preaching not me but brother branham if
[32:51] Paul walked in and said him brother
[32:52] brother branham's meeting he'd be like a
[32:55] house on fire on a windy day he would
[32:57] have been in jail the property guard
[32:58] said by morning why because he would
[33:00] take what the things he saw in part now
[33:06] we see in its fullness we've got
[33:08] everything we need look what about Paul
[33:11] going to the Old Testament now what
[33:12] about Paul right in the 80% of the New
[33:15] Testament but watch if he took that and
[33:18] took thee took the amplified version or
[33:21] took the prophets message and running
[33:23] through his filter he can't come out
[33:25] with something different these seals is
[33:27] not something different yet it is but
[33:32] it's not different than what's going to
[33:34] come from right here not different but
[33:37] it is something that nobody has ever
[33:39] known so I guess you can consider it
[33:41] different all right I to most is unusual
[33:46] that's the difference in you unusual and
[33:49] and different that you be not looking a
[33:52] watch this is Paul now watch what he's
[33:54] saying that you be not soon shaken in
[33:57] mind or be troubled neither by spirit
[34:01] nor by word nor in it all together nor
[34:05] by letter as from us as that the day of
[34:09] Christ is at hand he's telling the
[34:11] people something's going to have to
[34:13] happen now we can say by revelation we
[34:18] can say now see if Paul would read his
[34:20] own writings he'd say you're here you're
[34:24] at that day right now Paul was looking
[34:27] at a day every prophecy it some of us
[34:30] thinking about not too long ago every
[34:32] prophecy is pointed
[34:33] but man we're making it live today we're
[34:37] not proper sign of something to come
[34:39] anymore
[34:40] what are we prophesied to come
[34:43] resurrections already in you the rapture
[34:45] is already in you everything's already
[34:47] in you and then alright that's what
[34:50] these sales is going to do the sales are
[34:52] going to make it's going to absolutely
[34:54] make us we got something different
[34:56] we got thing different that's why I said
[35:00] about different you said well it's
[35:01] differently that's different but it's
[35:02] not going to come from something
[35:04] different like a new message book or you
[35:08] know something brother brother ot gave
[35:12] me two books by man and I'm really gonna
[35:14] read them because it's really to me it
[35:17] showing how that you know brother
[35:20] branham said that the World Council
[35:22] churches are the Protestants and the
[35:24] Catholics now what's the only thing they
[35:26] differ Nelion the sacrament are the wine
[35:30] and the blood being blood in the body
[35:32] being the literal body right man this
[35:34] guy writes them it's a big thick book
[35:36] but I'm gonna read it but he's that
[35:39] sacra that psycho psycho system society
[35:42] started way back anyway we're giving it
[35:44] a little bit later I'm gonna bring it
[35:45] into into a message but it I tell you
[35:48] what's gonna happen
[35:48] it shows something that I have told
[35:51] y'all since I started preaching our
[35:53] persecution is going to come from within
[35:55] our persecution will never come from a
[35:59] Baptist or a Methodist or a Presbyterian
[36:01] or Pentecostal it's gonna come from
[36:04] somebody maybe sitting right beside you
[36:07] today and you know what they're not
[36:10] gonna be able to help some of it so that
[36:13] spirit entered okay but we'll get into a
[36:17] little bit later why we need to bring it
[36:19] all home that's why we need to be aware
[36:23] that something's happening that God's
[36:26] bringing something what to just a
[36:27] special group of people
[36:29] Amen now look now watch as a day of
[36:32] Christ as that the day of Christ is at
[36:34] hand in other words forget it guys the
[36:35] day of Christ is not at hand at that
[36:37] moment alright cuz you do it said don't
[36:40] be shaking in mind don't be troubled
[36:42] neither by spirit nor by word nor by
[36:45] letter as from us
[36:47] that the day of Christ is the hand look
[36:48] let no man deceive you by any means for
[36:52] that day shall not come now it's going
[36:55] to come it's here but he's saying that
[36:58] day shall not come except there come a
[37:00] falling away first now to me it's a
[37:03] falling away of the word we could be
[37:05] sitting here today and fallen amen
[37:09] we're gonna be sitting right here today
[37:10] and be falling away amen are falling
[37:12] asleep like you're already starting to
[37:13] do falling away first I'm gonna play
[37:17] y'all that video they sent me a video of
[37:19] T DJ's and he's screaming wake up wake
[37:24] up he was telling the people to wake up
[37:28] by their sleep course they were shouting
[37:29] all over the place but anyway let no man
[37:32] deceive you by any means for that day
[37:34] shall not come except there come a
[37:35] falling away first and that man of sin
[37:38] be revealed the son of perdition all
[37:42] right except so now that we see that the
[37:44] seals are open the son of perdition is
[37:46] being exposed amen so so we're living
[37:49] this Paul wrote this never lived it you
[37:54] and I are living this all right that's
[37:58] what to me the seals to me the seals is
[38:00] come and see watch what's going on this
[38:04] thing's riding this thing's moving it's
[38:06] something going on all time until you
[38:10] get to what the Seventh Seal then
[38:12] there's silence no movement we'll get to
[38:16] that we'll get to that maybe by next
[38:17] Christmas let no man deceive you by any
[38:20] means for that day shall not come except
[38:22] there come a falling away first and that
[38:23] man of sin be revealed so he's got to be
[38:26] revealed he's got to be made known all
[38:28] right the son of perdition watch who
[38:31] opposeth and exalteth himself above all
[38:33] that is called God or that is worshipped
[38:37] so that he as God sitteth in the temple
[38:40] of God we're right here right showing
[38:44] himself that He is God
[38:45] remember what remember you not that when
[38:49] I was yet with you I told you these
[38:52] things and look I made myself a note
[38:56] here somewhere and now you know what
[39:00] with
[39:01] oldest that he might be revealed in his
[39:04] time that's now he's pointing he knows
[39:10] that the mystery of iniquity doth
[39:12] already work but that it's going to
[39:15] culminate in a man one man it comes to a
[39:22] system but it's going to culminate in a
[39:24] man alright and now you know what
[39:32] withholdeth what all this that he might
[39:35] be revealed in this time watch for the
[39:37] mystery of iniquity that's already work
[39:41] only what he know brother Brown said
[39:44] that he see how God hides it that he to
[39:47] me if you go through all of the of the
[39:50] capital lettering and all that of the
[39:52] Bible that he should have been capital
[39:53] cuz that He is God and then but God hid
[39:56] it just like the mighty angel that comes
[39:58] down as Christ in this a little a God
[40:00] hides these things through a property
[40:01] can bring them out but then when he
[40:03] shows it to us it's not like well I
[40:05] don't know if he's right or not know you
[40:06] know it's exactly what this Bible say
[40:08] alright only he who now letteth I was
[40:11] telling somebody the other day we were
[40:13] talking about downstairs who brother
[40:15] Louise would talk about trials and
[40:16] tribulations listen God remember God
[40:19] never had a oops moment he never had a
[40:21] moment that he said I really shouldn't
[40:23] have done that so every move God made to
[40:27] you trial tribulation whatever it is
[40:30] it's for your perfection he can't make a
[40:36] mistake that's why I have to put my
[40:38] trust in him I make a thousand mistakes
[40:41] but through him I had made a one for the
[40:46] mystery of iniquity doth already work
[40:48] wants iniquity doing something you're
[40:49] not supposed to do you do it anyway you
[40:51] know what you're doing you're overriding
[40:54] you're overriding grieve not the Holy
[40:58] Spirit of God whereby your hearts sealed
[41:01] your spirits not sealed we're gonna get
[41:03] into that your soul the sealed your
[41:05] spirits not Amen so that's what got Adam
[41:10] and Eve into trouble Satan didn't
[41:12] couldn't work down in the soul
[41:14] my name so he knew that he could get to
[41:16] the spirit right because remember before
[41:19] before the fall Adam had no memory of
[41:23] sin Adam had no conscious of sin because
[41:32] remember memory reason conscious
[41:34] affection and imagination Adam didn't
[41:37] have any of that wrong before the fall
[41:40] he was in tune with God his soul and his
[41:43] spirit was in tune with God amen but now
[41:48] remember though his body was being
[41:50] renewed he wasn't eternal okay alright
[41:53] so just remember that hold that point
[41:56] for the mystery of iniquity doth already
[41:57] work only he God who now letteth he's
[42:01] letting it happen will let until he now
[42:04] that he brother Brown says is the bride
[42:06] till he be taken out of the way
[42:11] do you know that Daniel seventy weeks
[42:14] the culmination of that is waiting on
[42:17] you bringing two prophets on the scene
[42:20] to preach the gospel is waiting on you
[42:22] those 144,000 are over there somewhere
[42:25] in the Middle East waiting on me and you
[42:30] to get what out of the way and then
[42:35] shall that because remember look Jesus
[42:39] preached the seal 2,000 years ago then
[42:43] the property guard broke them to us now
[42:46] we're in our feeble way trying to
[42:49] explain it or we're not helping the
[42:52] Prophet I promise you one bit we're
[42:54] hindering but we're what we're bringing
[42:56] to our back to our remembrance but those
[42:58] seals don't really open until the wicked
[43:01] one comes right we got to get out of the
[43:05] way right here's what he says until he
[43:07] the bride be taken out the way and then
[43:09] shall that wicked be revealed what in
[43:13] that last happened that last week of
[43:16] Daniel seventy weeks that's when he's
[43:18] going to be revealed say so that's when
[43:20] the seals are going to break he's going
[43:22] to get on a white righteous church
[43:26] remember the to pray
[43:28] six or the sixth seal oh you got it but
[43:31] we got to break them here now he's got
[43:35] to be broke to you
[43:37] doesn't matter if it's broke the brother
[43:38] Dale but it really does because through
[43:41] him since him being the pastor through
[43:42] him you got to get it and then because
[43:45] look if you look if not and here we go
[43:47] again
[43:49] then why we not took a rapture if
[43:51] brother Branham broke him and I'll read
[43:54] it I saved it for next Sunday
[43:56] brother Brown says when they're broke in
[43:58] their entirety
[44:02] he said in their entirety he said then
[44:06] what the door be closed so they were
[44:10] broke back then in 1963 I believe the
[44:12] seals broke to the profit but no one
[44:14] else no one else but when they're broke
[44:17] in their entirety
[44:18] that's when the lamb takes the book in
[44:20] step forth because remember once he
[44:21] takes the book he doesn't redeem anymore
[44:25] he's a judge and boy I tell you you
[44:29] talking about a message folks I'm
[44:31] telling you that word that brother Dale
[44:33] has been preaching on compassion and
[44:35] sympathy man talk about bringing
[44:39] something out more of how God works and
[44:42] how he deals with things man to me that
[44:46] was a seal that broke a man that was a
[44:49] seal that broke right there that was a
[44:54] thunder that's been what it's been are
[44:56] looking up condemnation and all the
[44:57] different things and back here and never
[45:00] looked up condemnation that much and
[45:01] then I looked up compassion and if
[45:04] you've got to dig in you'll see that
[45:05] they're the same but they're different a
[45:07] sympathetic guard is a grandpa a
[45:11] compassionate God is a judge a
[45:14] compassionate jart to be compassionate I
[45:17] mean to be sympathetic you can't be a
[45:19] judge because you sympathize with
[45:21] everything there's no judgment but a
[45:24] compassionate God brings the judge on
[45:26] the scene ma'am all right I didn't want
[45:30] to preach a sermon for you baby
[45:31] and then show that but I just it just
[45:33] don't those two words just two words
[45:35] will open when you separate them it
[45:38] opens up it when he does it makes me
[45:41] understand more
[45:41] because hey folks we got questions on
[45:44] questions on questions about what the
[45:46] Bible says
[45:46] questions about listen we're full of
[45:48] questions and that's alright as long as
[45:51] what we can strike them off and say that
[45:54] one's done we can strike them off and
[45:56] say that one's done because when we get
[45:58] down to our last question can I walk
[45:59] through that wall then I'm going to be
[46:01] able to walk that wall and then stuff
[46:04] that wicked be revealed you think it's
[46:05] funny one day we're gonna walk through
[46:08] the wall you think brother Tatum's got
[46:11] to open that door to walk in he's not
[46:18] gonna have a question either he's just
[46:20] gonna walk through the door not in
[46:23] through and then shall that wicked be
[46:26] revealed whom the Lord shall consume now
[46:28] when does he do that remember he does
[46:31] that over in the tribulation period
[46:34] right takes him out of the way and
[46:38] remember that man thrown in the lake of
[46:40] fire before the judgment before white
[46:43] throne judgment right him and the false
[46:46] prophet in the Beast all those remember
[46:47] they go in first and what shall consume
[46:51] with the spirit of his mouth now what's
[46:53] happened is we come down to now that's
[46:55] what's happening to you and I the only
[47:01] way we're getting a revelation is to
[47:02] hear it by somebody's speaking it with a
[47:06] spirit out of their mouth amen and shall
[47:10] destroy with the brightness of his
[47:12] coming now that's the coming that we're
[47:14] gonna we're not gonna say that's not the
[47:20] coming that we're talking about right
[47:21] this is the coming after everything's
[47:24] done we're already taking out the way so
[47:26] look let's just did use some deduction
[47:30] here if we're taken out of the way right
[47:32] here this doesn't apply to us
[47:35] right if we're gone but we got to get
[47:39] the revelation of it to get us out of
[47:42] the way and then shall that wicked be
[47:45] revealed whom the Lord shall consume
[47:46] with the spirit of his mouth and shall
[47:48] destroy with the brightness of his
[47:50] coming now to you and I that is the part
[47:53] of we got to see as far as
[47:55] my body changed but remember he's gonna
[47:57] come as a thief in the night this is
[47:59] where he's gonna everybody's gonna see a
[48:01] man alright even him whose coming is
[48:04] after the working of Satan with all
[48:06] power and signs and lying wonders that
[48:10] beast is going to speak over there when
[48:12] we get out of here
[48:13] and the only thing it's going to combat
[48:15] him is those two prophets right I saw
[48:18] the thing can stand against that man cuz
[48:20] he's what he's Satan incarnate now you
[48:23] know why he's Satan incarnate because
[48:24] God's incarnate incarnated in a group of
[48:27] people and Satan is a copycat and
[48:30] there's no way he can incarnate a man
[48:32] until God incarnates you and I a man and
[48:35] we get out of here alright and with all
[48:39] deceivableness of unrighteousness in
[48:42] them that perish because they received
[48:44] not didn't that they were seat didn't
[48:46] see the truth that love right there is
[48:51] not feeling your love that's a godly
[48:54] love that's the headstone that unless
[48:58] what because they receive not the
[49:01] headstone of the truth that they might
[49:04] be what saved a man so they what they
[49:08] they receive a lot and they're damned by
[49:15] that okay let's read what brother Browns
[49:20] standing to watch on the first seal in
[49:23] 1963 and at the end of the Pentecostal
[49:30] age we're supposed to receive according
[49:32] to the word is God helped me to not to
[49:34] show you through here that we are to
[49:36] receive a message or messenger that will
[49:39] take all those loose ends out there and
[49:41] reveal the whole secret of God for the
[49:43] rapturing of the church look now watch
[49:46] and then there's coming for seven
[49:48] mysterious thunders that's not even
[49:50] written at all that's right and I
[49:52] believe that through these seven
[49:54] thunders will be revealed in the last
[49:56] days in order to get the bride together
[49:58] for rapturing faith then all right look
[50:02] what look what he says I didn't
[50:05] highlight these I'm sorry because what
[50:08] we got
[50:09] now we wouldn't be able to do it what we
[50:15] got right now Lou the church we won't be
[50:20] able to do it there's something we've
[50:23] got to step further we can't have enough
[50:26] faith for divine healing hardly we've
[50:28] got to have enough faith to be changed
[50:30] in a moment and be swept out up out of
[50:32] this earth and we'll find that after a
[50:34] while the Lord willing find where it's
[50:36] written now he said right up here wasn't
[50:38] written but it's written right here cuz
[50:41] it's written in the Bible it's the whole
[50:43] Bible look then all the judgments of
[50:46] these evildoers
[50:47] now watch remember the judgment of the
[50:48] evildoers is not watch he moves right
[50:50] over into when we get out of here
[50:54] okay cuz remember Satan's not judged
[50:58] today he's judged in me and you out of
[51:02] us but remember he's not gonna be judged
[51:05] for what he's doing until we get gone
[51:06] until we get out of here right because
[51:09] what then all the judgments of these
[51:12] evildoers now see down through the ages
[51:14] as the seals has been breaking see they
[51:18] did break in simple form down through
[51:20] the church ages you hear me I said
[51:22] symbol form down to the church ages but
[51:26] it wasn't broke to Paul or Irene it's of
[51:29] Martin yet they were included in that
[51:31] first seal because the first seal
[51:33] remember represents the first three
[51:34] Church ages we'll get into that a little
[51:35] bit later all right put as a symbol
[51:38] listen you and I are not symbols we're
[51:43] real people amen
[51:45] and everybody else is going on there
[51:47] going on all right now see down through
[51:51] the ages as these seals has been
[51:52] breaking until now the last seal is
[51:54] broken and now as as they have been
[51:57] watching in on these seals and just
[52:00] presume me what they were doing no doubt
[52:03] Clarence Larkin got a revelation but he
[52:07] didn't get a full revelation he didn't
[52:09] listen to me he didn't get a prophetic
[52:11] revelation because he wasn't a prophet
[52:13] I don't depend on what Clarence Larkin
[52:17] said but he did speak truth okay
[52:21] I don't depend on what
[52:23] Billy Grimm said but he did speak truth
[52:24] and man right but it but I depend on
[52:28] what the prophet of God said the essence
[52:30] of this message I include all 1,100 some
[52:32] sermons a man as they have been watching
[52:36] in on these seals and just presuming
[52:38] what they were doing because remember
[52:41] Clarence Larkins could say the wild
[52:43] horse rider was the Antichrist but he
[52:45] couldn't take you no further all he saw
[52:48] was that you got it there okay brother
[52:55] Martin he got that's best that that
[52:57] right there that right there is it's not
[52:59] what we need for a body change that's
[53:04] what we need for a body change
[53:05] Clarence Larkin couldn't get in this
[53:07] unwritten Park right he could get a
[53:11] revelation of the seal twice a brother
[53:15] branham said the seals and it's
[53:16] understood everything's all right
[53:19] there's no way no one had a revelation
[53:21] of those seals as if a prophet no one
[53:24] and then they could probe at it well I
[53:28] probe at it well my lord we probed and
[53:30] prodded and presumed all the time but
[53:33] jesus never we got to go back to the
[53:36] person Jesus never poked and prodded he
[53:39] said I am well I might be then you know
[53:44] Testament man spoke to me and just a
[53:45] look I don't really know he know he knew
[53:49] what he was talking about right why
[53:52] because he was a fulfillment he was a
[53:54] kind I'm talking to you I'm talking to
[53:57] you
[53:58] you're a fulfillment or a culmination of
[54:00] what I just read you in Thessalonians it
[54:04] brings the two together and now as they
[54:08] have been watching in these seals and
[54:10] just presuming what they were doing now
[54:12] at the end of the ages of the church age
[54:14] not the end see all these evil doers
[54:17] will take place and head up into what
[54:19] tribulation right
[54:22] all of these evil doers of the seven
[54:24] seals has been working mysterious in the
[54:26] church sure they're working what
[54:28] underneath Satan's been working
[54:31] underneath weaving his way through the
[54:33] church because a mystery of iniquity
[54:36] starting the first
[54:37] all right all these evildoers will take
[54:40] place and head up in the tribulation all
[54:42] of these evil doers of the seven seals
[54:44] has been working mysterious in the
[54:45] church and we'll find out in a minute
[54:47] they even work in the name of a church
[54:49] they call themselves the church you just
[54:53] see if that isn't right no wonder I have
[54:55] been so against denomination not knowing
[54:58] why see see they end up now it starts
[55:02] back here in a mild form we'll talk
[55:04] about that later saying deed doctrine
[55:07] all right now it starts back here in the
[55:09] mile floor listen all doctrines start
[55:11] with two people talking all doctrine
[55:15] started with what do you think about
[55:16] what brother Ram said about right and
[55:20] then what one personal watch say well I
[55:22] got the revelation and I'm gonna tell
[55:25] you what it is you know we've been
[55:26] talking about this but you got to listen
[55:28] to me now you know that's the way Satan
[55:30] is that starts back here in a mile form
[55:32] just keeps getting worse and worse on
[55:35] down until and people go right into it
[55:37] saying oh yes this is just fine but in
[55:39] the last days these things are made
[55:41] known and they finally go so bad until
[55:44] they go plumb into the tribulation
[55:46] period he said that twice so remember
[55:50] the seals break in the Tribulation
[55:52] Period hello we just say the physical
[55:58] seal the physical man is standing there
[56:02] with power given to him to do things
[56:08] amen because remember the sixth seal the
[56:11] two prophets are standing on earth
[56:13] windowsills when the sixth seal breaks
[56:15] right so they got to be involved in the
[56:18] seals because who are they opposing
[56:21] right the horse rider because he's
[56:25] riding and they oppose him that all
[56:31] right but remember that's to profit you
[56:38] say well we got to wait till the
[56:39] Tribulation Period for the seals to
[56:41] break their will no tribulation period
[56:48] come without us getting a rebel
[56:50] of those sales they won't like I just
[56:54] said they won't - profits come without
[56:57] us getting a revelation of those sales
[56:59] now there won't come the Antichrist in
[57:04] his fullness until we get out of here
[57:07] man
[57:08] he's working he's working he's not dead
[57:12] foes he's working he's still riding but
[57:15] what are we doing we're bringing him to
[57:17] expose him we're bringing him up so that
[57:19] we can look and say hey that's not what
[57:21] we were supposed to do we have a
[57:23] commission to do away with death right
[57:27] and who is death that white horse rider
[57:30] that red horse rider that black horse
[57:32] rider that pale horse rider that saw
[57:34] he's death he is dead he's dead while
[57:36] he's walking mmm Bible says she's dead
[57:40] while she's living us thinking they so
[57:41] the devil is - he's dead while he's
[57:44] walking he when he did what he did he's
[57:47] done right now let's read number two and
[57:50] then we'll try to get into a few
[57:52] thoughts here on what happened a little
[57:56] bit more in the garden now look number
[57:59] two first seal we're still in the first
[58:02] seal now the Seventh Seal and I want to
[58:05] tell you just one thing see where that
[58:07] says roll book I was reading the seal
[58:11] book and I read that quote it says
[58:14] rolled so there was a typo one way or
[58:18] the other I haven't listened to the
[58:19] sermon I'm just telling you this so if
[58:21] you ever want to look that up again if
[58:22] you look at the quote in the book it
[58:24] says rolled book el rol LED and when I
[58:27] put rolled book in the search they come
[58:30] up zero I said there's no way I'm
[58:32] looking at the quote in a sailboat but
[58:35] when I put book is now being released
[58:38] that's what come up it says roll but
[58:41] it's the rolled book it's not roll this
[58:43] we wrote the book didn't roll that's a
[58:44] roll of the book all right like this
[58:46] this is the roll all right now the
[58:48] Seventh Seal just wouldn't tell you that
[58:49] in case you want to look at that now the
[58:51] Seventh Seal roll book is now being
[58:53] released by the Lamb we approached that
[58:55] place tonight god help us as the seals
[58:58] are broken and released the mysteries of
[59:00] the book are revealed now you see this
[59:03] is a
[59:04] sealed book let's stop right there for a
[59:07] second this is a sealed book when was it
[59:11] sealed in the Garden of Eden
[59:16] right when Adam couldn't produce because
[59:21] remember if Adam would have produced the
[59:24] product he was supposed to produce we
[59:26] wouldn't need a seal we wouldn't need a
[59:30] seal because if the seals is a
[59:33] redemption of our body bringing us to
[59:36] full Redemption Adam didn't need it at
[59:39] the time amen so only after the fall
[59:43] nice thinking of the day remember I
[59:44] preached that sermon on two life's cuz
[59:47] see our first life is dead
[59:49] amen we're born in sin shaping iniquity
[59:52] but now remember that's the reverse
[59:54] Latin Adam came to the world with the
[59:58] real life that we're supposed to live
[59:59] and he fell to that other life that's
[1:00:04] why they call it a fall so because of
[1:00:08] that though we've got to reverse the
[1:00:09] process we got to come from the first
[1:00:12] life and go back to that life because
[1:00:15] remember Adam did not have an endemic
[1:00:17] nature until after the fall
[1:00:20] Adam Adams spirit and soul we're not
[1:00:24] warring us what I want to talk about
[1:00:25] here for a few minutes they were not
[1:00:26] beating each other up right so where was
[1:00:33] the seal where did the seals come into
[1:00:35] being in the Garden of Eden when the
[1:00:36] fall happened that brought a
[1:00:39] manifestation that without the fall we'd
[1:00:44] never seen it but without the fall that
[1:00:47] takes the title of Redeemer away the
[1:00:51] very thing I told you if I ever wanted
[1:00:53] to call up brother dink likes to call
[1:00:54] him the Creator I like to call him the
[1:00:55] Creator too but if he wasn't the
[1:00:57] Redeemer it didn't matter how much he
[1:00:59] created right it didn't matter but
[1:01:05] Redemption tells me that that creator
[1:01:08] knew we were gonna fall and what more is
[1:01:12] like we were talking about the other day
[1:01:13] what a bunch of spoiled brats if we just
[1:01:16] have every
[1:01:18] sympathy sympathy God wasn't sympathetic
[1:01:25] in the garden I'll promise you no no
[1:01:28] like I said that's a grandpa where
[1:01:31] grandpa's were sympathetic we just
[1:01:33] really have brain damage when you become
[1:01:35] a grandfather when we become a
[1:01:36] grandparent but God's not a grandma
[1:01:38] daddy he's a father he's just a man all
[1:01:42] right so let's finish this quoting and
[1:01:43] I'll then I finished my my point here in
[1:01:46] a second this is a sealed book now
[1:01:50] remember where it was sealed it was
[1:01:51] sealed when when Adam had the ability to
[1:01:55] produce us right the book was sealed
[1:01:58] right man the book was sealed and God
[1:02:03] took it and said they can't nobody see
[1:02:06] this right you said prove it to me
[1:02:09] God said Daniel seal it up until what
[1:02:15] the time of the end seal it up till the
[1:02:19] time of the end because remember it was
[1:02:22] just a temporary seal oh just a
[1:02:27] temporary seal to get us back to
[1:02:28] eternity we're not gonna need a seal
[1:02:30] once we get into eternity is gonna be
[1:02:32] back to where Adam was that to me it's
[1:02:37] just one plus one equals two hey man so
[1:02:39] the book was sealed in the Garden of
[1:02:43] Eden
[1:02:44] now what as the seals are broken and
[1:02:47] released though look the mysteries of
[1:02:48] the book of revealed now you see this is
[1:02:51] a sealed book now we believe that do we
[1:02:54] not we believe that is a sealed book now
[1:02:57] we never knowed this before but it is
[1:03:01] it's sealed with seven seals that is on
[1:03:04] the back of the book the book is sealed
[1:03:06] with seven seals all right let's keep
[1:03:08] reading if we were talking about this
[1:03:10] kind of book he's talking about I'm sure
[1:03:11] he still might like this it would be
[1:03:13] like putting a strap across it just like
[1:03:15] I said about a hand right here seven
[1:03:17] straps but it isn't that kind of a book
[1:03:19] it's a scroll and then when the scroll
[1:03:22] is unwound that's one then laying right
[1:03:25] in that scroll is number two you just
[1:03:28] keep opening but it's a mystery but look
[1:03:30] what
[1:03:30] but yet we have probed in it but
[1:03:33] remember the book is sealed and the book
[1:03:36] is a book of mystery of Revelation it is
[1:03:39] the revelation of Jesus Christ not the
[1:03:42] Antichrist it exposes him sure it
[1:03:45] reveals him to a point but how much more
[1:03:50] if we presumed then we could be wrong
[1:03:54] right presume you could be wrong but
[1:03:58] when this book is open when the seals
[1:04:00] come off of this book there's nothing
[1:04:03] wrong with this book and there's nothing
[1:04:05] wrong with what's inside of this book
[1:04:06] and I thought you and I were supposed to
[1:04:08] be inside of this book amen so we're not
[1:04:11] presuming when you're born again listen
[1:04:13] if you're presuming you're in trouble
[1:04:16] but when you know you're locked in the
[1:04:18] revelation of Jesus Christ a book of
[1:04:21] Revelation and now you don't know down
[1:04:24] through the ages man has probed and
[1:04:25] tried to get into it we all have Martin
[1:04:28] Luther probably tried his best to
[1:04:31] further his revelation but he couldn't
[1:04:32] he couldn't why because the anointing
[1:04:35] for that hour was to do what he said to
[1:04:38] do and he'd done it give it to the
[1:04:41] people one off the scene that's the
[1:04:43] pattern in every age even this age amen
[1:04:48] same way in this age you can't be any
[1:04:50] different there's no there's no God
[1:04:52] doesn't get out of that pattern he
[1:04:53] brings a message he breaking the
[1:04:54] messenger I'm he brings a messenger
[1:04:56] bring the message gives it to the people
[1:04:58] and takes the messenger off the scene
[1:04:59] all right we know down through the ages
[1:05:03] they probed at it and trying to get into
[1:05:06] that he says we all have so we've all
[1:05:11] tried to do it we've all tried to and I
[1:05:14] say I don't say we I say all of
[1:05:16] Christendom has tried to in some way get
[1:05:22] a revelation but once you start on the
[1:05:26] rock like the Baptist if they start on
[1:05:28] the wrong if you start on the wrong path
[1:05:30] you got a right to ship somewhere
[1:05:33] because if you go father son Holy Ghost
[1:05:35] father son Holy Ghost Trinitarian you're
[1:05:37] never going to get to the truth
[1:05:38] the truths back that way and they just
[1:05:41] kept walking that's why brother Brown
[1:05:43] said to
[1:05:43] people were fine it was what that
[1:05:45] denominational idea okay that
[1:05:49] denominational idea is what turn to what
[1:05:51] the deed the doctrine and all those
[1:05:53] things we'll get into a little bit later
[1:05:54] all right made myself a note around here
[1:05:57] now look won't skip revelations 5 just
[1:06:01] save time go to where it says Redemption
[1:06:03] Redemption Redemption everybody knows
[1:06:06] what revelations 5 is breaking of the
[1:06:07] seal now look I wrote myself a note
[1:06:09] Redemption Redemption Redemption so
[1:06:11] think about Redemption Redemption
[1:06:12] Redemption Redemption means that if you
[1:06:14] drop this on the floor you got to pick
[1:06:17] this back up but you can't be if it's
[1:06:19] laying right here and you throw it down
[1:06:20] and you pick it back up and putting over
[1:06:22] here that is bringing it back but it's
[1:06:25] not bringing it back to its original
[1:06:26] place so whatever we fell from it's got
[1:06:30] to come back to its original place for
[1:06:33] full Redemption all right there by ok
[1:06:35] with that
[1:06:36] so look the breaking of the seals we'll
[1:06:38] finish with this and then we'll look at
[1:06:39] the symbols a little bit and then we'll
[1:06:40] close breaking of the seals is not
[1:06:43] necessarily for the soul now when I said
[1:06:45] not necessarily unlike brother Dale when
[1:06:47] you say just that takes everything out
[1:06:49] of the way when you say the John the
[1:06:51] Baptist John a Baptist would mean there
[1:06:54] was others but John the Baptist was one
[1:06:56] so I didn't want to say that breaking of
[1:06:58] the seals is not necess
[1:07:01] it's not necessarily for the song your
[1:07:03] soul feeds off of it your soul feeds off
[1:07:08] the raking of those seals but the
[1:07:10] breaking of the seals has nothing to do
[1:07:12] your soul is redeemed by the new birth
[1:07:14] by the shed blood of Jesus Christ by
[1:07:16] believing believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:07:18] Christ and thou shalt be saved
[1:07:19] don't say believe we'll just have a
[1:07:20] sales now he'll be saying all right
[1:07:22] that's why I said many Christians many
[1:07:26] born-again believers down to those
[1:07:29] Church ages are gonna resurrect come
[1:07:31] back and glorified bodies and never
[1:07:35] heard maybe a sermon preached about the
[1:07:37] seventh seal okay but now we can't
[1:07:41] disclose that and say that it's not
[1:07:43] important because to them it wasn't but
[1:07:44] to us it is it's our Commission we have
[1:07:48] a commission we have an anointing we
[1:07:50] were coming out of mourning last night
[1:07:51] we have an anointing that goes with the
[1:07:54] new birth that we have
[1:07:57] mr. Mallen can't afford those two things
[1:07:58] remember all right but by the shed blood
[1:08:03] of Jesus Christ at Calvary we're
[1:08:05] born-again believers that seals our soul
[1:08:07] so that nothing can get in and nothing
[1:08:09] can get out
[1:08:10] amen and we feed off of the revelation
[1:08:13] of the word amen but remember our spirit
[1:08:18] as I telling them last night our soul is
[1:08:20] spinning in this direction and our body
[1:08:21] and our spirit spinning in the other
[1:08:23] direction because we lean toward that
[1:08:27] Adamic nature we all got it I wrote
[1:08:30] myself a note see the Adamic nature was
[1:08:32] not in Adams soul the Adamic nature that
[1:08:37] the scripture is talking about is the
[1:08:39] nature that we have that spirit realm of
[1:08:43] memory reason conscious affection
[1:08:45] imagination but but the breaking of the
[1:08:49] seals will bring full fellowship back
[1:08:51] into manifestation that's the way I
[1:08:54] believe it because remember before the
[1:08:55] fall Adam and Eve were one but their
[1:09:02] body and learning but forget about the
[1:09:04] body the body just moves when something
[1:09:05] inside of it tells it take when we say I
[1:09:08] was telling dad like Schneider or in the
[1:09:10] minute ago when we say the redemption of
[1:09:12] the body that means that we're supposed
[1:09:14] to to me in our brain we think about
[1:09:16] well I gotta clean this thing up it's
[1:09:19] God comes on the inside this is just a
[1:09:21] shell the only way you the way you die
[1:09:24] is let's think about this one June's
[1:09:25] momma was passing away I'm sorry a
[1:09:28] little morbid but anyway you think about
[1:09:29] it the reason her soul left her body is
[1:09:32] is it couldn't function any more like a
[1:09:34] human that's all the way it was released
[1:09:40] when your body quits functioning
[1:09:44] altogether Ruth when your body quits
[1:09:47] function your souls gotta leave so can't
[1:09:50] stay in that body right so your body's
[1:09:54] just shelled it's the shell that holds
[1:09:57] everything together and I don't mean you
[1:09:58] got I mean it holds all that fired
[1:10:01] mechanism all that stuff is going off
[1:10:03] because remember when you pass away
[1:10:05] these don't work anymore
[1:10:07] right no organs
[1:10:10] is working what's making your organs
[1:10:12] work now it's not only your body that
[1:10:16] spirit inside to use what's making it
[1:10:17] work
[1:10:18] my spirit inside to use what's making
[1:10:20] nothing work because remember even if
[1:10:22] you get your spine severed your mind is
[1:10:26] still working your brain is still
[1:10:28] working and you know what your heart
[1:10:29] still beating a lot of things work some
[1:10:33] don't work but you got to remember one
[1:10:35] thing this body then when we say the
[1:10:37] redemption of the body don't think we
[1:10:39] got to get this thing cleaned up or that
[1:10:42] we've got to get 20/20 glasses if we
[1:10:44] can't see 20/20 that's not it the
[1:10:46] redemption of the body is when all like
[1:10:49] I said when everything comes into
[1:10:52] fellowship together when the spirit and
[1:10:54] the soul starts working back together
[1:10:56] again the problem is is when Adam watch
[1:11:00] Adam had no conscious of sin he wasn't
[1:11:04] even guilty we guilt ourselves to death
[1:11:12] but before the fall Adam was so in tune
[1:11:15] with his memories and conscience
[1:11:17] affection and imagination he had no
[1:11:19] imagination
[1:11:20] what do you imagine well I imagine
[1:11:23] that's good no I imagine the words right
[1:11:28] I'm talking about us I imagine the words
[1:11:29] right no it's right memory that's what
[1:11:35] kills most of us Adam had no memory of
[1:11:38] sin he had no memory of I was afraid
[1:11:43] right his conscience never bothered him
[1:11:47] whole hallelujah that's what that's
[1:11:50] private they say that an animal can lay
[1:11:53] down and just fall asleep I think dad's
[1:11:56] got a little bit of animal in him those
[1:12:02] buddy before the lights go out he's
[1:12:04] going bye-bye but a dog goes why because
[1:12:07] they have no conscience
[1:12:08] I don't an animal doesn't have a
[1:12:10] conscience so he's not guilty but you
[1:12:16] and I are conscious memory reasoning
[1:12:18] conscious affection imagination that's
[1:12:21] the five things and that that
[1:12:24] action is not a ghave affection remember
[1:12:28] you love with your spirit
[1:12:29] the Prophet floats prophet said you love
[1:12:31] your spirit but you love God with your
[1:12:32] soul because it is God it is God because
[1:12:36] like I said before I had them Adam in
[1:12:39] his watch what happened in his even in
[1:12:42] his godlike condition when Eve did what
[1:12:44] she did laid with the Beast brought it
[1:12:46] to him Billy oh love take over no no the
[1:12:53] agape love of God took over that soul
[1:12:55] stepped out and said oh my what have we
[1:12:57] done I can't kill you Eve because you're
[1:13:03] part of me
[1:13:04] amen that wouldn't been in his spirit
[1:13:08] realm but to look memory reasoning what
[1:13:13] did Adam reason about think about this
[1:13:16] what Adam reason about he sit down and
[1:13:19] go now I'm sitting to call that a tiger
[1:13:22] cuz I think maybe God didn't want me to
[1:13:24] call it a tiger no he never had that's
[1:13:26] what it was that's what he was that's
[1:13:29] what God even God didn't God didn't say
[1:13:32] wait a minute Adam he said how is that
[1:13:34] cool when I was thinking so you and I
[1:13:38] with our stinking thinking what who do
[1:13:40] we question sure we question ourselves
[1:13:42] we question herself but we question God
[1:13:45] God why did you cuz Adam said God said
[1:13:50] Adam worked out he said I was afraid in
[1:13:53] other words it was a question can I
[1:13:55] approach this God now with what I just
[1:13:57] done see they didn't come from his soul
[1:14:00] his soul longed for God his soul was a
[1:14:03] part of God if he had if he if he had
[1:14:07] Holy Ghost in his soul if it's soul was
[1:14:09] the eternal as God is then that was God
[1:14:11] in there cuz I think you know today you
[1:14:14] know we think of all the bad things even
[1:14:15] what he did
[1:14:17] I'm be a little carnal here from it you
[1:14:19] would think I'm trying to get help us to
[1:14:21] not beat ourselves up so much because if
[1:14:24] these sales are for our redemption of
[1:14:26] the body then we got to work outside of
[1:14:27] that soul there is therefore now no
[1:14:32] condemnation who cannot believe that
[1:14:39] but we condemn ourselves but you take
[1:14:42] you take the things we do in life most
[1:14:46] of the things we do in life or contrary
[1:14:47] to God you're in your humanity in your
[1:14:54] humanity you go to work we're gonna work
[1:14:57] in the future home did I don't have to
[1:14:59] work no we have to eat and do them other
[1:15:06] things that's connected with food right
[1:15:09] that's what I'm telling you our carnal
[1:15:12] mondo tells us where we're no good
[1:15:14] because we do X Y Z a husband and wife
[1:15:18] the beds nine different beds undefiled
[1:15:21] amen it's not shameful if you do it
[1:15:26] right
[1:15:27] God give us a way to do everything right
[1:15:29] what to get to make us realize that
[1:15:33] we're not so bad but it's going to take
[1:15:36] God Almighty to tell us that it's gonna
[1:15:39] take he put it in here already he
[1:15:43] already put it in the word hey don't
[1:15:44] come from rear Dominick he don't come
[1:15:47] from our mcdonald Almanac it doesn't
[1:15:48] come from my what George Meyers I hope
[1:15:51] she I hope she is watching you need to
[1:15:54] wear some no earrings and let your hair
[1:15:56] grow out her hair shorter mine but
[1:15:59] everybody loves George Meyers why cuz
[1:16:01] she tells you a good thing sympathizer
[1:16:08] sympathy most denominations are
[1:16:12] sympathetic their sympathy you know you
[1:16:15] just come where you want to you know
[1:16:16] income now all bless your heart or know
[1:16:21] the compassion that we have is we want
[1:16:24] them all save but the compassion that we
[1:16:26] have though is is going to stand one day
[1:16:27] and judge them people because remember
[1:16:30] the compassion that God had can't be
[1:16:32] separate from the compassion you have if
[1:16:34] you're born again right that's why this
[1:16:38] wholesale thing I want you to see is
[1:16:40] it's not God up here and nuts down here
[1:16:43] and God forbid I don't want to make him
[1:16:45] a piece of paper but the position I
[1:16:48] thought Jesus cry
[1:16:50] we're heirs and joint-heirs whatever
[1:16:55] he's got we get he's standing somewhere
[1:16:59] with an eternal body and remember
[1:17:03] brother Branham said Satan tempted Jesus
[1:17:08] right
[1:17:09] never did he tempt Jesus in his body
[1:17:13] can't tempt the body body just reacts
[1:17:17] you can't tempt his soul you can't even
[1:17:20] hardly attempt his spirit but he did
[1:17:22] Satan
[1:17:23] what tempted him but remember it doesn't
[1:17:27] matter about the temptation you and I
[1:17:30] partake of it he didn't because remember
[1:17:34] before the fall there even if anything
[1:17:37] was to come up to Adam how could he
[1:17:39] handle it you understand what you get it
[1:17:43] how could even handle it he didn't know
[1:17:45] how to handling cuz he'd never handle in
[1:17:47] the Lord what am I telling you when we
[1:17:49] get into glory when we get to the future
[1:17:51] home we're not gonna have to handle
[1:17:53] situations amen when we take a body
[1:17:58] change what we gonna handle I've done
[1:18:02] told you like they tell us it's Trudy I
[1:18:04] really don't care what we're eating at
[1:18:06] the future it's a wedding supper I
[1:18:08] really don't care what we're doing in
[1:18:09] the Millennium you say you don't care no
[1:18:11] I don't because look what I got inside
[1:18:13] of me if I got it inside of me it's
[1:18:15] gonna take me there and it's gonna be
[1:18:17] what all sufficient I'm not gonna go to
[1:18:20] the Millennium and go what am I doing
[1:18:22] here why am I not all we're doing now is
[1:18:31] sharpening the edges the big thing
[1:18:34] should be taken care of all we're doing
[1:18:37] is we're sharpening the edges now
[1:18:40] remember if Adam had no conscious of sin
[1:18:44] and no guilty conscience and obviously
[1:18:49] no memory of sin until after the fall
[1:18:52] Amen so something was sealed up and I
[1:18:58] was trying to show him last night a
[1:18:59] little bit kind of what I want to you
[1:19:00] know it's talking about the the soul
[1:19:03] spending in this direction
[1:19:04] because you'll remember your spirits
[1:19:06] what's contrary to God now you were born
[1:19:09] in sin your body came from an act that
[1:19:12] should have never happened but it did
[1:19:13] and it was allowed by God but that
[1:19:15] spirit realm is where both people can
[1:19:17] work God and Satan can work right then
[1:19:22] so what happened with Adam and I'm going
[1:19:25] to try to find that quote where brother
[1:19:26] Branham said Adam was Adam was his
[1:19:29] everything got clouded after the fall
[1:19:32] cuz remember his spirit and his body
[1:19:34] worked hand-in-hand before the fall this
[1:19:39] has got a lot to do with the seals I
[1:19:40] don't know where you believe that or not
[1:19:41] but it does cuz we got to understand his
[1:19:45] soul was still you can't remember the
[1:19:48] Bible says grieve not the Holy Spirit of
[1:19:50] God whereby your watch sealed until the
[1:19:52] day of your Redemption so the soul is
[1:19:54] sealed you can't look you can't even
[1:19:58] when Paul said I was I'm worrying in my
[1:20:00] members it wasn't in the soul it was in
[1:20:04] his spirit realm
[1:20:06] you don't war against God in your soul
[1:20:08] unless you're what not born again
[1:20:10] there's your war but all it does is it
[1:20:14] brings that war out to that outside that
[1:20:18] middle realm of men listen please right
[1:20:21] memory region conservation imagination
[1:20:23] down on a piece of paper cuz that's your
[1:20:25] problem it's not that your body aches no
[1:20:29] that's because you got your wearing out
[1:20:31] your souls not wearing out I thought
[1:20:37] your soul was 20 years old amen so
[1:20:43] you're not hurting in your soul unless
[1:20:44] you're hurting for God but really in
[1:20:48] your soul cuz remember you got to take
[1:20:50] that soul and once it's born again you
[1:20:51] gotta you can't touch it nobody can
[1:20:54] touch it God can't even take it away
[1:20:56] from you he can't it's a free gift he's
[1:21:04] give it to you you shall receive the
[1:21:07] what gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:10] the problem with Adam was is somewhere
[1:21:13] in there his soul and his spirit
[1:21:16] detached
[1:21:20] somewhere it somewhere it detached and
[1:21:23] then this is this is a soul this is not
[1:21:27] the Adamic nature that we that we this
[1:21:29] is the problem over there that all right
[1:21:35] something where they don't work
[1:21:37] continuity anymore a man because once
[1:21:41] you're born again let me one more time
[1:21:42] once you're born again you've got all
[1:21:44] the fullness you're part you're not the
[1:21:50] fullness of the Godhead by that's not
[1:21:52] what I say it I said you get the
[1:21:54] fullness of God right hello you need so
[1:21:59] where's the problem it's that mental hub
[1:22:02] that's what hugging that soul let me
[1:22:06] know and saint saying no no but there's
[1:22:11] your damning nature right that's your
[1:22:15] problem
[1:22:15] listen my problem is my memory my
[1:22:19] problem is my conscience heavenly days
[1:22:22] reasoning my fashion and Lord there is
[1:22:29] no imagination in God thank God for a
[1:22:33] prophet though that could separate those
[1:22:35] and tell us there was a third out in the
[1:22:38] soul five senses in the spirit and five
[1:22:41] senses on the outside thank God
[1:22:44] but somewhere Adam became detached from
[1:22:47] that and that what that was what after
[1:22:50] the fall so what that so when Abel was
[1:22:52] born he was detached somewhat because
[1:22:58] you and I are the same way but what are
[1:23:01] we going back to though if it was pulled
[1:23:04] apart in a garden it's got to be put
[1:23:07] back together
[1:23:10] so let's don't glory in that it was
[1:23:12] pulled apart
[1:23:13] that's glory in that there was a way
[1:23:16] made back that we can get back to that
[1:23:19] continuity between getting both spinning
[1:23:21] in the same direction amen because
[1:23:25] really the sails is not to redeem this
[1:23:28] shell it's to bring everything back in
[1:23:33] harmony with God in other words to plug
[1:23:41] it back in because remember your spirit
[1:23:47] realm is not born again amen
[1:23:51] just something to think about your
[1:23:52] spirit realms not born again only your
[1:23:56] soul if you're born again if you're born
[1:23:58] again now listen if you're not then your
[1:24:00] warden and the inside guy really you're
[1:24:03] black on the inside it's just smutty
[1:24:06] devil possessed sorry
[1:24:10] no good areas to me the gray areas on
[1:24:15] the outside the memory region kind
[1:24:18] that's where the gray area is the inside
[1:24:21] you're either wider black and I'm not
[1:24:23] saying color you understand what I'm
[1:24:24] saying
[1:24:25] you're either white righteous and
[1:24:27] everything's done away with there's not
[1:24:29] one little speck somewhere God cleans
[1:24:31] that thing out and resides come on
[1:24:36] puts himself in there and then he starts
[1:24:40] working and here we go
[1:24:43] well remember Paul said I'm warring in
[1:24:45] my members he sounds playing he said I'm
[1:24:50] worrying my members why he had a memory
[1:24:55] his conscious was killing him because he
[1:24:59] had those Christians killed what in the
[1:25:02] name of the religion he thought he
[1:25:04] already had that's our problem
[1:25:16] grieve not the Holy Spirit of God
[1:25:18] whereby you're sealed but remember that
[1:25:20] is your earnest that is your earnest
[1:25:23] until the full possession and the full
[1:25:26] possession for me and you it's not
[1:25:27] something we got to go into another
[1:25:28] dimension to get we got to get it in
[1:25:30] this dimension yes it's in this
[1:25:36] dimension we got to get this because
[1:25:38] remember when the seal is open
[1:25:40] he shows Christ it shows the head shows
[1:25:43] the head in its fullness and its
[1:25:44] completeness hey man is that Alright so
[1:25:49] it has a lot to do to see this this to
[1:25:51] me this is when brother Branham preached
[1:25:55] for what since 1933 you really started
[1:25:59] preaching from 1933 to 1963 he was
[1:26:04] warring in his members not in a soul he
[1:26:08] was born again but he was warring in
[1:26:10] that spirit realm but when God comes
[1:26:13] down and said this is what you're here
[1:26:16] for right here revelations 10 7 this is
[1:26:23] your Commission
[1:26:24] I believe he knew sister Jenny Malachi 4
[1:26:27] was part of his commission but see I
[1:26:30] believe God had to reveal to him that
[1:26:32] revelation 10 1 through 7 was his
[1:26:33] commission amen because he's you know in
[1:26:37] Malachi 4 it doesn't say that the
[1:26:39] seventh angel is to turn the heart
[1:26:42] it just says Elijah will come and turn
[1:26:44] the hearts doesn't say this it doesn't
[1:26:46] identify him but when you get over here
[1:26:47] in revelations 10 1 through 7 it says
[1:26:49] what the seventh angel begins to sound
[1:26:52] his message the mystery of God will be
[1:26:54] finished that's the part that he had
[1:26:56] right there that's why he said they had
[1:26:58] to do two things one what turn the
[1:27:00] hearts of the children to the father's
[1:27:03] and to reveal the mysteries according to
[1:27:08] revelations 10 7 I believe he puts in
[1:27:10] that quote revelation 10 7 he's supposed
[1:27:12] to what break the mysteries to you and I
[1:27:15] so that we can get out of here and
[1:27:18] that's what we're doing now the first
[1:27:19] seal is when it's open
[1:27:25] when that first seal opens correct me if
[1:27:28] I'm wrong
[1:27:30] they all have to open
[1:27:33] they can't what I'm saying is that God
[1:27:36] can't just open one ceiling say well
[1:27:37] ain't gonna open the other one once that
[1:27:40] first seal is open it's just like it's
[1:27:42] just like what because remember in a
[1:27:48] scroll you paid attention to that right
[1:27:53] sister Jeannie and a scroll doesn't
[1:27:56] matter if it's a hundred pages they all
[1:27:59] fault they all roll up and there's one

[1:31:05] Father we pray Lord if what we said in a
[1:31:07] feeble way has helped us to see a little
[1:31:10] more light that when these we get into
[1:31:13] the symbols and the things that that we
[1:31:15] see that you're doing any endtime Lord
[1:31:17] it they'll be more clear that that
[1:31:19] clarity will come to the message that
[1:31:21] will truly see that what we were quoting
[1:31:25] there where we're going to come back
[1:31:27] into full fellowship not when we get to
[1:31:29] the Millennium not what that would be
[1:31:30] easy that'll be easy when we get to the
[1:31:33] future home to be in complete fellowship
[1:31:35] with you but you want us to be in
[1:31:37] complete fellowship with you here here
[1:31:40] in this Satan's domain he slipped into
[1:31:42] your domain and caused this thing to
[1:31:44] happen and now Lord you're down here in
[1:31:47] Satan's Eden

[1:32:12] ourself clean and and shed all the junk
[1:32:16] that happens during the month because

[1:32:21] using our memory and conscious all those

[1:33:33] blasphemous names it was the body that
[1:33:37] got lost the world that got lost it's
[1:33:41] gonna be brought back
[1:33:43] amen and amen what a wonderful day what
[1:33:46] a time to be able to say we have heard
[1:33:49] the word in our life days we've heard
[1:33:54] dword the man of sin he can't be
[1:33:58] revealed until the bride is taken out of
[1:34:01] the way
[1:34:02] then he can come forth throw them let's
[1:34:06] get out of here no it's going into the
[1:34:10] communion den and we go to John and
[1:34:13] supper being ended the devil having put
[1:34:16] into the heart
[1:34:17] Judas Iscariot Simon's son to betray him
[1:34:20] he's just knowing that the father had
[1:34:22] given all things into his hands and he
[1:34:24] was come from God and went to God he
[1:34:27] rises from suffering let aside his
[1:34:28] garments and took a towel and girded
[1:34:30] himself after that he poured water into
[1:34:33] a basin and began to wash the disciples
[1:34:35] feet and to wipe them with the towel
[1:34:38] worried where he was excuse me I have to
[1:34:42] go to Corinthians I'm starting off
[1:34:45] backwards
[1:34:46] I turned my scriptures and then turned
[1:34:49] it backwards let's go to Corinthians who
[1:34:52] everybody wonder where I'm at I'm in
[1:34:54] Corinthians all right I've received of
[1:34:57] the Lord that which also I delivered
[1:34:58] unto you and to Lord Jesus I'm not in
[1:35:01] which he was betrayed took bread and
[1:35:03] when he had given thanks he brake it and
[1:35:05] said take eat this is my body which is
[1:35:08] broken for you that's doing remembrance
[1:35:10] of me after the same manner also he took
[1:35:13] the cup when he had supped saying this
[1:35:15] cup is the New Testament in my blood
[1:35:17] this do ye as oft as you drink it in
[1:35:20] remembrance of me for as often as you
[1:35:22] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:35:24] shew the Lord's death till he come
[1:35:26] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:35:28] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:35:31] unworthily she'll be guilty of the body
[1:35:33] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:35:35] examine himself I like that and so let
[1:35:39] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[1:35:41] Cup he didn't eat earthen drinketh
[1:35:43] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[1:35:45] to himself not discerning the Lord's
[1:35:48] body but this cause many are weak and
[1:35:50] sickly among you and many sleep for we
[1:35:53] would judge ourselves we should not be
[1:35:55] judged but when we are judged we are
[1:35:57] chastened of the Lord I like that
[1:35:59] real good that we should not be
[1:36:01] condemned with the world wherefore my
[1:36:04] brethren when you come together to eat
[1:36:05] tarry one for another and if any man
[1:36:09] hunger
[1:36:09] let him eat at home did you come out
[1:36:12] together under condemnation and the rest
[1:36:14] of us said in order
[1:36:16] when I come so let's just take a few
[1:36:18] moments and just Harry one for the other
[1:36:23] brand one for the other that the Lord
[1:36:25] would take care of everything and I
[1:36:28] believe he's doing it he's promised it
[1:36:32] why don't you pray sometimes believing
[1:36:35] that God is going to fulfill his word
[1:36:38] because he said he would he's gonna keep
[1:36:43] his promise we don't have to worry about
[1:36:46] it let's just have me a few moments of
[1:36:48] silent prayer
